With help from federal grant
funding, the University will soon

tout a new $46-million nanome-

researchers the opportunity to
pursue nanotechnology projects
in healthcare, biotechnology and
energy among other fields.
The Center of Excellence in
Nano Mechanical Science and

from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, will
be a three-story complex featur-

ing 60 lab modules and rooms for
18 professors, according to a Uni-
versity press release distributed
yesterday.
The 62,800 square-foot com-
plex will be built adjacent to
the G.G. Brown Laboratories on
Hayward Street, accordingto the
release. Construction on the site
will begin in the spring of next
year and is projected to be com-

The University invested $15
million in the complex with an

additional $6.5 million from the
College of Engineering and $15
million in private commitments,
leaving the NIST grant funding
to cover the remainder of the
construction costs.

ITS: Change to

By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Fumbling through a backpack,
trying to log on to a computer and

then frantically searching for a
stapler has become routine for stu-
dents who opt to print out pages at
the last minute. But when there is
a printer malfunction, students are
often met with an obstacle they
can't overcome.
Though there were an uncom-
mon number of printing problems
earlier this month on campus -
particularly at printing stations

in the Fishbowl in Angell Hall -
Information and Technology Ser-
vices said the problems have since
been corrected. ITS officials attri-
bute the printing difficulties to a
change in the print server infra-
structure that happened before the
fall term began.

Chronicle claims
council held closed
door meeting about
medical marijuana
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor Chronicle
filed suit against the Ann Arbor
City Council earlier this month,
accusing the council of violating

the Michigan Open Meetings by
holding a closed-door meeting
regarding a medical marijuana
moratorium.
The Michigan Open Meetings
Act requires that the content of
certain meetings of government
bodies be available to the public.
According to Dave Askins,
co-owner of the Ann Arbor
Chronicle, the closed session
on July 19 made it "impossible"
for the public to know all of the
discussion on the moratorium,
adding that City Council didn't

give enough notice to prevent
the suit.
"The suit had considerable
merit, and I think it's clear from
the way that we documented the
timeline, that led to the lawsuit,"
Askins said. "We gave the City
Attorney and the City Council
every opportunity to remedy the
situation in a way that would not
have required a lawsuit."
During an Aug. 5 open meet-
ing, Council member Stephen
Rapundalo (D-Ward 2) referred

For the creative thinkers in
Wolverine Soft, a video game
development club on campus,
offering up an idea - whether
big or small - is the first step
in creating a new video game.
"Game development is a
very iterative and evolution-
ary process, with developers
trying new ideas, improving
on existing ideas, and scrap-
ping ones that don't work,"
wrote club president and
Engineering junior Curt Law-
rence in an e-mail interview.
After a club member initi-
ates anideaand aprototypefor
the game is developed, group
members evaluate the proto-
type for its level of entertain-
ment, Lawrence wrote. While
the group is focused on enjoy-
ing the games they create -
each week, members meet to
not only develop games, but

c)lverrne Soft

play them - there's also a high
level of artistry involved.
"What we all have in com-
mon is a love of creation, of
bringing our ideas to life, and
video games are a powerful
and fun way of doing that,"
Lawrence wrote.
The love of creation has
attracted students with a mul-
titude of talents to the group,
which has about 30 active
members.
In addition to welcoming
students who are familiar
with software engineering,
Wolverine Soft also invites
student artists, musicians and
writers to participate in the
game design process. Law-
rence wrote that members can
choose to participate in mul-
tiple areas of game develop-
ment in an environment that
is "social and collaborative."

"Within our small teams
everyone wears many dif-
ferent hats, while at a games
company people specialize (in
one area)," he wrote.
Outside of the Duderstadt
Center, where the club meets,
professionals are beginningto
take note of the group's hard
work. Lawrence wrote that
last year, eight members were
selected to attend a confer-
ence for professional game
developers. This year, the
group plans to host several
game companies, including
Electronic Arts.
"The goal is for more stu-
dents and video game com-
panies to know that we exist
and do cool things, and I
think we're in a good posi-
tion to share that message,"
he added.

Obama rallies, scolds Dems in campaign trip.

President tells
fellow Democrats
they must participate
in midterms
MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Buck
up. Stop whining. And get to work.
Clearly frustrated by Republi-
cans' energy - and his own party's
lack of enthusiasm - President
Barack Obama scolded fellow
Democrats even as he rallied them
Tuesday in an effort to save the
party from big GOP gains in the
crucial midterm elections. In the
final month of campaigning, he's
trying to re-energize young vot-
ers, despondent liberals and other
Democrats whose excitement over
his election has dissipated.

"It is inexcusable for any Dem-
ocrat or progressive right now to
stand on the sidelines," the presi-
dent declared in a Rolling Stone
magazine interview. He said that
supposed supporters who are "sit-
ting on their hands complaining"
are irresponsible because the con-
sequences of Republican congres-
sional victories could be dashed
Democratic plans.
He gave an example during
a backyard conversation with
New Mexico voters, arguing that
Republicans would reverse the
progress he's made on education
reform and student aid. "That's
the choice that we've got in this
election," Obama said, underscor-
ing the stakes of Nov. 2.
Later, at an outdoor rally at
the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, the president urged

thousands of students to stay as
inspired and involved in this elec-
tion as they were two years ago.
"We can't let this country fall
backwards because the rest of us
didn't care enough to fight," he
said to loud applause.
It was the first of four large
rallies planned for the campaign
homestretch as the presidenttries
to rekindle some of his 2008 cam-
paign magic and fire up young
supporters and others who helped
elect Obama but who Democrats
fear may stay home this fall. Top
lieutenants Vice President Joe
Biden, Democratic Party Chair-
man Tim Kaine and Cabinet
members also fanned outon other
college campuses to call party
foot soldiers to action.
At Penn State University in
State College, Pa., Biden noted he

was criticized a day earlier in New
Hampshire for urging Democrats
to "remind our base constituency
to stop whining and get out there
and look at the alternatives."
"All I heard when I got here
in Happy Valley was the roar
of lions. Folks, it's time for us to
roar," Biden said, pressing his
audience to knock on doors, make
phone calls and commit to vote.
With the elections looming,
the White House and Democratic
Party are focused primarily on
trying to compel their core voters
- liberals and minority groups -
as well as the ideologically broad
coalition that helped elect Obama
in 2008 to participate in the first
congressional elections of his
presidency.
They have little choice.
Midterm contests largely turn

on which party can get out more
of its backers. And polls show that
Republicans are far more enthu-
siastic this year partly because of
tea party anger. Also, polls show
Democrats can't count on inde-
pendent voters who carried them
to victory in consecutive national
elections.
Mindful of that and armed
with polling, the White House
has started arguing that voters
who backed Obama in 2008 must
turn out for Democrats this year
because the GOP wants to undo
what the president has accom-
plished.
"We are focused on motivation,
not laying blame or pointing fin-
gers, because the consequences
for sitting this election out could
be disastrous," said Dan Pfeiffer,
the White House communica-

tions director.
White House aides said House
Republicans "Pledge to America"
last week made it easier for Obama
to do something he's been trying
for weeks: to frame the election
as a choice between Democrats'
ideas and Republicans' proposals.
By signaling plans for deep spend-
ing cuts in popular areas such as
education, officials said, the GOP
pledge presented an opportunity
for the White House to remind
voters, and particularly the base,
what's at stake in November.
Aides say Obama was trying
to underscore those stakes in his
interview with Rolling Stone,
and the final-stretch strategy -
in everything from rhetoric to
events - is to underscore that
midterm elections have conse-
quences.

NEWS BRIEFS
. JAKARTA, Indonesia
Powerful quakes hit
Eastern Indonesia
Two powerful earthquakes
hit waters off eastern Indonesia
in rapid succession early today,
prompting officials to briefly trig-
ger a tsunami warning.
The U.S. Geological Survey said
a 7.2 magnitude quake off Papua
province, centered just 7 miles (12
kilometers) beneath the ocean floor,
struck less than a minute after a 6.6
temblor in the same location.
The town of Tual on nearby
Maluku island was shaken, said
Fauzi, chief of the Indonesian
meteorological and geophysics
agency, but there were no immedi-
ate reports of injuries or damage.
The area closest to the epicenter
is remote and sparsely populated.
Located 1,800 miles (2,900 kilo-
meters) east of the capital, Jakarta,
it is closer to the northern Austra-
lian city of Darwin, which sits some
560 miles (900 kilometers) to the
south.
Fauzi's agency lifted a tsunami
warning 90 minutes after the tem-
blors struck, saying the threat for
destructive waves had passed.
NEW YORK
Times Square
bomber: 40 people
were supposed to
die in attack
The man who planted a car
bomb in Times Square boasted that
he thought it would kill at least
40 people and that he planned to
detonate a second bomb two weeks
after the first, prosecutors said yes-
terday, quoting the former finan-
cial analyst in a video where he
said he'd hoped "to join my broth-
ers in jihad" ever since the Sept. 11
attacks.
Faisal Shahzad should get life in
prison when he is sentenced Oct. 5,
prosecutors said in a filing, argu-
ing that he "had every intention of
delivering a powerful and terroriz-
ing strike to the heart of New York
City."
The government noted that
Shahzad showed no remorse when
he pleaded guilty on June 21 after
confessing to investigators.
In fact, prosecutors wrote, "he
spoke with pride about what he and
his coconspirators had done."
LANSING, Mich,
Michigan public
schools to see cut
funding restored
Michigan's public schools will
get more money through a distribu-
tion of federal assistance approved
by the state Legislature.
The Republican-led Senate and
Democratic-led House yesterday
overwhelmingly approved a bill
that will restore $154 per student
to every district in the state in the
fiscal year that starts Friday. That
essentially would return schools
to at least the annual minimum of
$7,316 per student that districts

were supposed to get before budget
cuts in the 2009-10 fiscal year.
School districts would receive
an additional $23 to $46 per stu-
dent beyond the $154 per student
restoration under the bill headed to
O Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
Schools are one of the relatively
few areas not getting cut in Michi-
gan's latest budget votes.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti.
U.S. names special
Haiti coordinator
The U.S. State Department has
named Thomas C. Adams as its
special coordinator to oversee
Washington's reconstruction plans
in earthquake-ravaged Haiti.
Two officials at the department
told The Associated Press yester-
daythatAdams has already started
on the job. The officials agreed to
discuss the move only if not quoted
by name because the appointment
had not been made public.
The disclosure came a day after
the AP reported that none of the
$1.15 billion in reconstruction aid
pledged by the U.S. in March has
* arrived. Washington has provided
$1.1 billion in humanitarian aid
since the quake, but rebuilding
cannot begin without the prom-
ised longterm reconstruction
funds from the U.S. and others.
In the meantime, 1.3 million
Haitians remain on the streets
nearly nine months after the mag-
nitude-7 earthquake, living in
miserable conditions and dying in
storms.

U.N. says Afghan election
a positive sign for country

considers banning
guns on campuses

Sept. 18 election
brought in
4.3 million ballots
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Afghanistan's ability to even hold
recent legislative elections shows
it is starting to take control of its
own future, a U.N. special envoy
said yesterday as Security Council
members took stock of the war-
ravaged country's most recent
attempt at democracy.
The Sept. 18 parliamentary elec-
tions "mark an important step
toward advancing Afghanistan's
political process and development,
in particular the strengthening of
its democratic institutions," said
Steffan de Mistura, U.N. special
representative to Afghanistan.
"One must not forget that
Afghanistan is still a country in
conflict," de Mistura said. "The
fact that elections took place at all,
not least in such close succession
and during comparatively a more
volatile period, is an accomplish-
ment in itself."

This month's vote was the first
since last year's presidential elec-
tion was almost derailed by wide-
spreadballot-box stuffing and tally
manipulation. That poll led many
Western nations to question their
support President Hamid Karzai's
government.
About 4.3 million ballots were
cast in the latest election, or about
one-fourth of the country's 17
million registered voters. There
were more than 2,500 candidates,
including nearly 400 women, for
249 parliamentary seats. Results
are expected Oct. 30.
Election day was marred by
rocket attacks and bombings. De
Mistura said the U.N. mission
there recorded 32 civilian deaths
and 95 injuries related to the vote.
So far, the parliamentary elec-
toral process has shown "signifi-
cant improvements" over the last
year's presidential vote, said De
Mistura. While there are no early
signs of massive or systemic fraud,
"there were possibly widespread
irregularities," he added.
Afghan Foreign Minister Zal-
mal Rassoul called the elections

"a major victory for democracy in
Afghanistan."
The actinghead of the European
Union delegation to the U.N., Pedro
Serrano, told the council that it was
"too early to make a full assess-
ment of the polls" but praised "the
thorough preparations which were
largely ensured by Afghan institu-
tions."
He said the EU had a long-term
commitment to Afghanistan, and
during the 2011-13 period will
increase its European Community
humanitarian and development
aid to 200 million euros annually.
Serrano said EU members together
are already giving Afghanistan
nearly 1 billion euros annually.
U.S. Ambassador Susan E. Rice
also welcomed the U.N. envoy's
report, calling the elections an
"important, step toward a stronger,
more stable Afghanistan."
"These electionswould nothave
been possible without the Afghan
National Security Forces," Rice
said, notingthat the U.S.is working
to prepare Afghan security forces
to take the lead on their nation's
own security by 2014.

Post UT shooting,
legislature weighs
banning guns on
college campuses
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -
Texas already lets lawmakers
bring guns into the Capitol.
And the governor sometimes
jogs with a loaded pistol. But
should people be allowed to
carry concealed weapons onto
college campuses?
Gun advocates argue that
doing so could help put a quick
end to threats like the one
posed by a University of Texas
student who fired several
rounds from an assault rifle
Tuesday before killing himself.
Under current law, college
buildings in Texas are gun-
free zones. But that did not
stop Colton Tooley from dart-
ing along a street near the uni-
versity's clock tower Tuesday,
shooting off an AK-47. He then
entered a library and shot him-
self. No one else was hurt.
Police had no evidence Tool-
ey was targeting anyone, but
there was plenty of discussion
Wednesday about how much
worse the bloodshed could
have been - and how to ensure
that scenario never happens.
"There are already guns on
campus. All too often they are
illegal," Republican Gov. Rick
Perry said. "I want there to be
legal guns on campus. I think
it makes sense - and all of
the data supports - that if law
abiding, well-trained, back-

grounded individuals have a
weapon, then there will be less
crime."
Perry's Democratic chal-
lenger, Bill White, said he sup-
ports the state law that lets
people with licenses carry con-
cealed handguns. But he wants
individual schools to decide
whether to allow guns on cam-
pus.
He said Perry's position
"is the government ought to
coerce campuses to allow con-
cealed handguns on campus."
The gunfire erupted near
the scene of one of the nation's
deadliest shooting rampages.
Tooley started shooting near
a fountain in front of the UT
Tower - the same site where
a gunman ascended the clock
tower and fired down on doz-
ens of people in 1966.
The Lone Star State makes
it relatively easy for people to
buy assault rifles like the one
Tooley had, as well as other
types of firearms, at gun shops
and gun shows. Texas enacted
a concealed handgun law in
1995, allowing people 21 and
older to carry weapons if they
pass a training course and a
background check.
Businesses, schools and
churches can set rules banning
guns on their premises. On col-
lege campuses, guns are pro-
hibited in buildings, dorms and
certain grounds around them.
Advocates for allowing con-
cealed guns on campuses say
if more people packed heat, it's
more likely one of them could
stop a gunman before he hurts
anyone.


Terror plot in Europe
prompted drone strike

Potential attacks
lead to increased
security in U.K.
LONDON (AP) - Police
increased their guard around
Buckingham Palace and other
landmarks yesterday as security
officials monitored what they
described as a fledgling ter-
ror plot to wage Mumbai-style
shooting sprees or other attacks
on Britain, France or Germany.
At least some of the recent CIA
strikes in Pakistan were aimed at
al-Qaida operatives suspected
in the plot, U.S. officials said.
European officials said the plot
was still in its early stages and
not considered serious enough to
raise the terror threat level.
Still, the Eiffel Tower in Paris
was briefly evacuated Tuesday
- the second time in two weeks
because of an unspecified threat
- and French police were on
alert.
A heavy police presence was
seen yesterday around Bucking-
ham Palace, Trafalgar Square
and Big Ben. Victoria Station was
briefly evacuated after an unusu-
al smell was reported.
"This plot was in its embry-
onic stages," a British govern-
ment official told The Associated
Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity because of the sen-
sitivity of his work. He said the
plot had preoccupied the secu-
rity community more than other
recent threats; but did not merit
changing the security threat
level from severe to critical.
Some details about the plot
came from Ahmed Siddiqui, a
German citizen of Afghan back-
ground who was captured in
Afghanistan in July, a U.S. offi-
cial said.
Intelligence authorities used

National Security Agency wire-
taps to flesh out details, U.S.
officials said, and while a Mum-
bai-style shooting spree was one
possibility, there was no con-
crete plan. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to
speak about the plot.
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton told reporters
yesterday the U.S. was working
closely with its European allies,
but declined to provide specif-
ics.
"We are not going to com-
ment on specific intelligence as
doing so threatens to undermine
intelligence operations that are
critical in protecting the United
States and our allies," Clinton
said. "As we have repeatedly
said, we know that al-Qaida and
its network of terrorists wishes
to attack both European and U.S.
targets."
"I want Americans to know
how focused we all are in the
government and how committed
we are not only in protecting our
own country but in protecting
our friends and allies."
The Department of Homeland
Security would not say Wednes-
day whether U.S. security has
been enhanced as a result of the
terror threats in Europe.
Revelations of the plot came
just ahead of the anniversary
on Thursday of the publication
of the Prophet Muhammad car-
toons in a Danish newspaper.
It also came as Spanish
authorities announced they had
arrested an American citizen of
Algerian origin on suspicion of
financing al-Qaida's North Afri-
can affiliate.
Mohamed Omar Debhi, 43,
was taken into custody Tuesday,
although Spain's Interior Minis-
try said the arrest was not con-
nected to the terror threat.

Obama is solid on Israel

Schooled on reform
Obama must back education changes with funds
The American public education system is in dire need of
fixing and President Barack Obama thinks he has the
solution. Earlier this week on the Today, Obama put
forth some suggestions. He advocated extending the school
year, getting rid of inefficient and underperforming teachers and
emphasizing a more active parental role in a children's education.
Schools all over the country are already under immense budget-
ary strains. Obama needs to ensure that any suggested plan care-
fully considers the effects of the reform and appropriates federal
funds to support it.

On Monday, in response to a question
on NBC's Today from Matt Lauer, Obama
stressed the need for a longer school year.
He reiterated that America is being sur-
passed globally in terms of educational
standards. Many studies show that in high-
er-achieving nations - Japan, South Korea,
Germany and New Zealand - students
attend school more days a year. Obama
also highlighted weeding out inefficient
teachers and holding parents accountable.
Obama acknowledged that lengthening the
school year would be expensive, but stated
that it would be "money well spent."
A longer school year is a viable solution.
For starters, the more time students spend
in school, the more they're immersed in an
academic environment. For underprivi-
leged students, this is especially impor-
tant, as they don't have the same access to
summer learning programs. Shortening
summer vacation will also help with reten-
tion, meaning teachers will spend less time
reviewing at the beginning of the year.
Additionally, a longer year gives teachers
more time to adequately cover all the neces-
sary material. Teachers have more space to
work in additional lessons and to stretch out
material over a period of time, as opposed to
cramming it in at the end of the term.

However, this reform, like any other, has
its drawbacks. Every year when the spring
months roll around, students start burning
out, eagerly awaiting vacation. Adding an
extra month may double the stress, lead-
ing to discouraged and frustrated students.
Moreover, summer is an important time for
family vacations, athletics and social devel-
opment. America prides itself on producing
well-rounded individuals with people skills
as well as intelligence and this shouldn't be
compromised.
But perhaps the biggest issue with this
proposal is funding. Schools are already
cutting a day out of the week in order to cut
costs. With budgets already tight, asking
schools to remain open for an extra month
is a stretch. It is imperative that any pro-
posed reform be backed up by sufficient
federal funds. It is unfair to pass huge
education cuts, while at the same time ask
schools to pay for more.
In the words of Obama, simply "throw-
ing money at the problem won't work."
This is true as major reforms are needed
in the American public education system.
However; without money, there will be no
reforms. In order for American students to
be prepared to compete globally, America
needs to reinvest in education.

For whatever reason, I tend to
hang out with a lot of lefty,
politically conscious Jews.
Birds of a feather
flock to the same
delicatessens,
I guess. But as
another election
approaches, these
people whom I've
always known to
share my progres-
sive politics have
grown increasingly MATTHEW
disillusioned with GREEN
the Democrats. And
not for the same
reasons why every-
one else has. From what I've heard
in the Jewish media and seen in for-
warded chain-emails from my bubby,
it's clear that an increasing number
of Jews feel disheartened by what
they perceive to be President Barack
Obama's frosty approach to Israel.
I hear the same tropes repeated
over and over - Obama supports
Hamas; he's critical of Israeli settle-
ments; he snubbed Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit
to the White House. And 6,000 miles
to the east, in Israel, the anti-Obama
sentiment is even more impassioned.
During a ten-day visit to the Holy
Land in May, I tried to talk politics
with almost everyone I met. Though
the Israelis I came across seemed
to love the U.S. and Americans, the
vast majority were highly skepti-
cal of Obama. Many suggested that
he's weak on terrorism and a hand-
ful said they thought he was a prac-
ticing Muslim. If it weren't for their
accents, I might've mistaken them for
Tea Partiers.
As I talked to these Israelis, Ilooked
forward to the rest of my summer in
Washington, D.C., where I hoped I
might learn concrete facts - in addi-
tion to hearing opinions - about the
current U.S. relationship with Israel.
Fortunately, as an intern for an orga-
nization with a strong hand in Israel-
advocacy, I had the opportunity to
attend a number of seminars and lec-
tures focused on Middle East policy.

I made a point of continuing seri-
ous dialogue with interns from both
AIPAC and J Street, two separate
voices in the world of Israel advocacy.
And I supplemented my experience
by reading scores of articles debating
the pros and cons of Obama's policies
regarding Israel.
So what did I discover? For start-
ers, I learned some objective num-
bers. As pointed out by Assistant
Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro,
the Obama administration requested
the largest sum for Israeli security
assistance in history - $2.775 billion
for fiscal year 2010. And for FY2011,
the administration bumped up their
request to $3 billion. That number
doesn't even include the $205 million
that Obama requested from Congress
earlier this year to support a new
Israeli missile defense project known
as the Iron Dome.
And in addition to sheer numbers,
the aid that Obama has overseen is
being used in unparalleled ways to
advance what's known as Israel's
Qualitative Military Edge - its capac-
ity to counteract state and non-state
actors while keeping losses minimal.
Particularly in the face of President
George W. Bush's sale of arms to Per-
sian Gulf states in the effort against
Iraq, Israel's QME diminished dur-
ing the Bush administration. But
under the auspices of Obama, through
increased efforts to share military
intelligence and technology, Israel's
QME has grown by leaps and bounds.
Just this Monday, the Pentagon
announced yet another collaboration
with Israel to advance an additional
weapons system to defend against
short-range ballistic missiles.
But military aid is only part of the
picture. While it's true that President
Obama has criticized Israeli settle-
ments in the West Bank, it's crucial
to note that some of his most conser-
vative predecessors - George H. W.
Bush and Ronald Reagan, in particu-
lar - were equally critical of settle-
ments. Far from being anti-Israel,
the president's recent call on Netan-
yahu to continue a settlement freeze
for the duration of the current peace

talks exhibits his dedication to peace.
It's also worth mentioning that
Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was
supposedly snubbed at the White
House earlier this year, expressed
his gratitude for Obama before an
American crowd last week. He assert-
ed that Obama's commitment to the
peace talks "made a great impres-
sion on me." In July, in an interview
with Fox news, Netanyahu also said,
"all U.S. presidents...including Presi-
dent Obama, share what the presi-
dent called the basic bedrock of this
unbreakable bond between Israel
and the United States." If Obama ever
offended Bibi Netanyahu in the past -
and it's not clear that he ever did - it

has actually done a
lot for Israel.
appears that the two leaders currently
have a perfectly healthy relationship.
That isn't all that's surprising
when one considers that the two men
share one very important policy goal:
preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. In
July, Obama told an Israeli television
network that thwarting Iran's nucle-
ar ambitions "has been my number *
one foreign policy priority over the
course of the last 18 months." And the
Obama administration has strongly
supported sanctions against Iran,
particularly targeting its influential
banking system.
Nearly halfway into his first term,
Obama has surely left a lot to be
desired on a variety of issues. Though
I'm still optimistic about him, I've
been less than thrilled with much of
his leadership. But when it comes to
supporting Israel, Obama has been
exactly the president I'd hoped he'd
be. And as the peace talks go forward,
the Obama administration'is ,rock
solid in its support of both Israel and
lasting peace in the region.

to pay for college.
It isn't viable for a democratic society to

This letter was written by Kate Stenvig and
Deandre Watson on behalf of the Michigan
Student Assembly.

Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, is widely
derided for his now infamous quote: "Never let a good
crisis go to waste." But there may actually be some sage
wisdom locked away in this partisan sound bite when it
comes to curing our financial system.
Stocks and bonds surged, as well as the morale of many,
following last week's declaration of the end of the reces-
sion by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Yes,
the unemployment rate still continues to hover just below
double-digits, but there's no doubt the announcement
will return some long-lost confidence to the markets that
has yet to be captured in polls.
Obviously, this is a good thing. But on the other hand,
have we undergone enough reform in the past two years
to prevent the same problems from recurring, or are we
poised for another recession when the next bubble bursts?
One of the only positive aspects about an economic
downturn is that we can learn from it to make sure it
never repeats itself. Former Treasury secretary Andrew
Mellon once suggested that the Great Depression would
"purge the rottenness out of the system." This concept
- Emanuel and Mellon allude to - can be applied to all
walks of life. Different words, same idea.
What worries me here is that Congress could lose much
of its impetus for financial reform as a result of this crisis
supposedly being over. After all, is it still an urgent prior-
ity to reform if we aren't even in a recession? I'm worried
we may just let the recession go to waste and return to
business as usual. I'm concerned we may lose our urgency
here, just as we did with climate change and gas prices
when the economy suddenly stole the show in the fall of
2008.
However, simply being told the recession is over doesn't
suddenly place food on the table. Ten percent unemploy-
ment is still very real and many Americans worry of a
double-dip recession when stimulus money runs out. A
lack of long-term confidence isn't really a good thing, but

it does make us proceed with caution, which isn't always
a given.
The European economy was hit hard by both the global
credit crunch and sovereign debt crises, and as a result, the
EU became all about financial reform and austerity. Now,
the unexpected economic success of the past quarter is
widely interpreted to mean Europe has weathered the cri-
ses, and the momentum behind further reform is stalling.
But even EU leaders concede this success is pretty
much an accident and they don't expect it to continue.
This past quarter, exports led the German economy to
grow at its fastest rate since the fall of the Berlin Wall
and a few of Germany's neighbors posted similar results.
However, the countries in trouble remained in trouble
as economists continued their calls for reform, warning
about unsustainable growth.
This is the path we don't want to take, which could
lead to the dreaded double-dip recession. This is where
I worry we could forget Emanuel and Mellon's words and
let this crisis go to waste if we follow in Europe's foot-
steps. As of now, we don't appear to be doing so, but after
seeing the way the energy bill was scrapped this summer,
I have reason for concern.
As The Economist said when recently referencing the
massive growth of Latin America after its 1980s sovereign
debt issues, the idea of radical reform ended up paying off
and Europe should be taking note of this success. And
even though nobody is talking about an American sover-
eign debt crisis, we should be taking notes as well before
we talk about emerging from this mess for good.
Perhaps we won't let a good crisis go to waste; per-
haps we're doing our due diligence to purge the rotten-
ness from the system and perhaps the negative, skeptical
views seen in polls are exactly what we need. For that, we
may be the envy of Europe.

In 2009, Sullivan sai the 'U'
can fix 'crummy classrooms'

From Page lA
During the interview, Hanlon
also hinted that more of the build-
ing may be renovated in the near
future.
"Stay tuned on this," Hanlon
said after being asked about con-
verting classrooms in Dennison
Hall. "I think you're going to hear
something fairly major pretty
soon."
Hanlon didn't specify what
the "fairly major" announcement
would be. However, it's unlikely
that the renovation of only the
sixth floor would constitute a
"fairly major" announcement,
since Sullivan already announced
plans to renovate a floor of the
building in an interview with The
Michigan Daily in 2009.
"It won't hurt the educational
program. In fact, it will make it
better because nobody's going
to have to teach or learn on the
fourth floor of Dennison any-
more," Sullivan said at the time.
"We can replace these crummy
classrooms with better class-
rooms."
The renovation and relocation
of the programs is part of an ini-
tiative to better utilize existing
facilities owned by the University,
Hanlon said.
"We remain very committed
to making better use of our class-
room facilities," he said. "We
want to use our University space
as efficiently, as effectively as
possible."
Ultimately, Hanlon said, that
means converting outdated class-
rooms to better meet the needs
of the University, which could
reduce the amount of space the
University leases.

that the money is actually being
spent on food as it's intended,"
Laiderman said.
The Eatblue meal plan card is
meant to attract more interest by
way of a variety of deals and dis-
counts.
"In order to entice students to
get their parents involved we do
a lot of discount promotions and
different kinds of deals within the
cards themselves, so you can get
a lot of free food promotions and
discount by purchasing with the
cards," said Laiderman.
Laiderman says the cards have
been very successful so far.
"We just signed on our toOth
cardholder which, for a new pro-
gram, we're pretty excited about
that," said Laiderman.
Law studentJeff Klein saidthat
if the discount was large enough,
he might think about it, but oth-
erwise did not think it would be
worth restricting himself to a
handful of restaurants.
"I'd rather just carry cash," said
Klein.
Business School senior Bill
Penegor said he definitely would
be interested in an off-campus
card option, because it would
allow him to have a way for his
parents to pay for his food.

Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and
Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich)
in addition to Democratic Gov.
Jennifer Granholm for their
efforts in supporting the con-
struction of the complex.
Granholm praised the new
complex in the press release and
discussed the potential impact of
the research projects housed by
the building.
"This new facility will help
train the next generation of
engineers in our state, and pro-
duce the cutting-edge research
and development in energy,
health care and manufacturing
that will continue to diversify
our economy and create jobs,"
Granholm said.
that the decision to take part in
the new meal plan card was large-
ly to make eating at the restaurant
easier for students by offering
them another way to pay.
"On a lot of our campus loca-
tions we look at the student-based
card to see if we can make it eas-
ier on the students and give them
other ways to frequent their favor-
ite places on- and off-campus,"
Francis said.
Francis added that more pro-
motion is necessary to make sure
customers know which restau-
rants are involved.
"We still think there's some
awareness opportunities, where
even though we've got the sticker
in our window... some people may
not know that we accept the Eat-
blue card," she said.
Wendy Shinde, owner of Great
Wraps, on the 300 block of State
Steet, said she was previously
signed with Eatblue, but that the
new meal plan card has not been
used very frequently.
"In theory if they market the
heck out of this and they get a lot
of people signed up, and people
start coming in to use it then that's
a different story," Shinde said.
As of now, though, Shinde says
that it won't be worth keeping the
new meal plan card in the long
run.
"You're supposed to pay a
monthly fee for the machine, and
when it comes to that, I'm going
to say no, because right now ... I'm
getting like one per day," Shinde
said.

The sixth floor of Dennison yesterday. University Provost Philip Hanlon said the floor will be converted into office space.

with horseshoe shaped tables and
lots of technology, we of course
don't want to look at (converting)
those," Hanlon said. "We want to
look at the (classrooms) that are
of lower quality, more traditional
flat-floored, poor acoustics, and
so on."
In addition, Hanlon said it's
better to look for large blocks of
outdated classrooms to convert
into offices because it means
there will be more options for
designing the space.
"That gives us the most flex-
ibility because if you take a set
of classrooms and convert them
to some other use, if they're all
together then we can take out
walls and build other kinds of
spaces," he said.

These factors arguably make
Dennison the perfect target for
renovation and repurposing on
campus.
"A lot of these things drive you
back to Dennison because Denni-
son has a large collection of class-
rooms," Hanlon said. "They're
traditional, flat-floored class-
rooms and as we've said before,
the building itself doesn't have
good landing space once you leave
the classrooms."
Hanlon said there is also an
increasing pressure to continue
working toward the Space Utili-
zation Initiative's overall goal of
using general purpose classrooms
on campus 70 percent of the time
during core hours, with each use
taking advantage of 65 percent of

the seating in the classroom.
"We are bringing online a
bunch of new classrooms," Han-
lon said, referring to new class-
rooms at North Quadrangle and
those being built in the new
Law School Academic Building.
"That's just intensifying the pres-
sure for us to figure out what
classroom stock we really need
and what we can convert to other,
more important uses."
But if that pressure wasn't
enough to drive Hanlon to con-
vert more spaces in Dennison, he
said he has a personal motivation
too.
"I am teaching in Dennison this
semester," Hanlon said, laughing,
"just to remind myself of what the
experience is."


Both Rapundalo and City
Attorney Steve Postema declined
to comment on the recently filed
suit.
Council member Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) said that she and other
members of the Council were
caught off guard that the new mor-
atorium was added to the agenda
of the early August meeting.
According to Briere, Rapan-
dulo said the moratorium was dis-
cussed in the closed session but
later retracted the statement after
gauging other council members'
confusion. Briere added that she
was unaware of the moratorium's
origins and that the issue was not
discussed in detail at the closed
session.
"Members of council - myself
included - were surprised that
the moratorium existed, it was not
something that we were expect-
ing," she said. "From a personal
standpoint, I think it's a terrible
thing that anyone would have to
file suit against the city. From a
member of council standpoint, I
would hate to think that Council

or the city at any level fails to obey
any open meetings act."
Briere said in the future, she
hopes the content of closed-door
sessions are disclosed to the pub-
lic after they have been conclud-
ed.
"I would hope that what there
would be would be a consistent,
clear cut understanding of- why.
the council is going into closed
session, what's going to be accom-
plished in that closed session,
what's appropriate to discuss and
what's not appropriate to discuss
in that closed session and that
everyone knows those rules," she
said.
Dennis Hayes, a lawyer spe-
cializing in medicinal marijuana
legislation, said the contents of
the ordinance could have been the
reason for the closed-door meet-
ing, noting that medical marijua-
na is a touchy subject for the City
Council.
"We have been butting heads
with (the city attorney) from the
get-go," he said.
Hayes said the Council would

not extend an invitation to him
for a closed meeting even if the
session focused on medical mari-
juana. He added that his versions
of medical marijuana ordinances
have never been allowed to exist
on the City Council agenda and
that the council has always had.
a "narrow" approach to dealing
with the issue.!
"They would rather have no
relationship with medical mari-
juana-and we won't let 'em," he
said. "In this case, it was a dis-
service to everybody because you
have to have an open discussion
about medical marijuana."
This isn't the first time city
council has been accused of vio-
lating the open meetings act. In
Sept. 2009, the council banned
electronic communication
between council members dur-
ing meetings in order to be more
transparent, after council mem-
bers were criticized for sending
e-mails discussing city business
and sometimes mocking speakers
at the meetings.

ITS received as many as 35 student
printing complaints this semester

Mich. budget to
eliminate $484
million def icit

FromPage1A
lead for ITS, wrote in an e-mail
interview that there were about
30 reported printer problems
on campus between Sept. 7 and
16. These reports often come
from roving staff members, who
inspect every print site loca-
tion on campus during the week,
or from consulting staff that
encounter a printer problem as
they work, she said.
Loveless wrote that during that
period of time, ITS also received
between 25 and 35 complaints
from students who were unable to
use the printers.
Though reports were gathered
across campus, Loveless said that
the majority of complaints came
from the printing locations in and
around the Fishbowl in Angell
Hall, which has the highest print
volume of campus's approximate-
ly 12 million double-sided annual
page output.
The printer malfunctions
were caused by an infrastructure
change to the print servers that
was completed before the begin-
ning of the school year, Loveless
wrote. But because the change
was implemented across campus
and affected all campus print-
ing locations, Loveless added, the
initial problems were not unex-
pected.
"When a highly technical envi-
ronment is upgraded/updated it is
not uncommon to see some bugs
or instances where things do not

Students study in the Fishbowl yesterday. ITS officials said they fixed printing problems that were plaguing the space.

With federal help,
lawmakers make
budget deadline for
first time in 3 years
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Mich-
igan lawmakers wrapped up the
final key pieces of the next state
budget yesterday without tax
increases and with spending cuts
in many programs other than aid
to public schools.
The Legislature beat its budget-
balancing deadline that coincides
with the start of the new fiscal year
Friday. Lawmakers had missed the
deadline in two of the past three
years, but the job was made easier
this time because of extra cash
from the federal government.
Some of the final bills passed
yesterday by the Republican-
led Senate and the Democratic-
run House included proposals
to allow Sunday morning liquor
sales in Michigan and provide
money for road projects. The
bills will be reviewed by Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm,
spokeswoman Liz Boyd said late
Wednesday.
Lawmakers are erasing a pro-
jected $484 million deficit in the
next budget. The deficit would
have been far larger if it weren't
for extra federal help.
The latest boosts came with
the announcement in August that
Michigan would get an additional
$380 million for Medicaid and
about $316 million for schools.
Overall, more than $1 billion in
one-time, extra federal assistance
will be in next year's budget.

"It's the best we could do in
a tough situation," Democratic
House Speaker Andy Dillon said
of the budget, hindered in large
part because of dwindling rev-
enues due to Michigan's poor
economy. "Thank God for the
support from the federal govern-
ment, because it would have been
very difficult."
Dillon and Republican leaders
said next year's budget will be
tougher because the federal aid is
expected to expire.
Dillon had wanted bigger,
longer-term changes including a
consolidated health care plan for
public employees in the state. The
proposal has bogged down in the
Legislature, but Dillon may con-
tinue to push for its passage.
Senate Republican Majority
Leader Mike Bishop wanted more
cost-saving reforms in the budget,
but a consensus on many of his
plans could not be reached.
"I think, under the circum-
stances, this budget did take a
step in the right direction," Bish-
op said.
The Legislature voted Wednes-
day to restore $154 per student to
every district in the state in the
fiscal year that starts Friday. That
essentially would return schools
to at least the annual minimum
of $7,316 per student that districts
were supposed to get before bud-
get cuts in the 2009-10 fiscal year.
Districts would get $23 to $46 per
student on top of that, depending
on how much they now receive in
state aid.
Most community colleges will *
be safe from operating budget
cuts, but universities face a 2.8
percent reduction.

work in their anticipated man-
ner," Loveless wrote.
As ITS staff worked to find the
sources of complaint, they discov-
ered problems with queue moni-
tor displays and the sequence in
which jobs were printed, Loveless
said. There was also a problem
with the multiple pages per sheet
setting on the MPrint website.
After changes were made to the
coding and infrastructure of the
print servers, Loveless wrote that

all previous system-wide issues
have been fixed.
LSA senior Casey Barnhart said
she had problems with the Angell
Hall area printers but didn't do
anything about it when the prob-
lems occurred.
LSA sophomore Amanjot Sarao
also said she had problems print-
ing in the Fishbowl, but the issues
did not dissuade her from con-
tinuing to print there.
Though the infrastructure

transformation initially caused
problems, Loveless said in a
phone interview that she thinks
the change to the new system will
be better for the campus overall.
"It really is going to be a great-
er solution, because we need
fewer print servers, which saves a
whole lot of energy, which is ter-
rific," she said. "At the same time,
it actually makes infrastructure
faster so the printers can respond
more quickly."

By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
The beginning of fall classes
was still a week away, but when
the Michigan men's soccer team
gathered in its
new locker room NOTEBOOK
before taking the
field for the season debut, the Wol-
verines were given a history lesson.
In preparation for the program's
first game at its new $6-million
masterpiece stadium on Sept. 1,
Michigan coach Steve Burns sat
his team down and played a video
highlighting several major stadi-
ums, the first games played there
and the long-lasting success of the
home team in each of those com-
plexes.
Included in the presentation
was Michigan's own Big House,
which was christened with a 33-0
victory over Ohio Wesleyan.
At the end, the video froze on a
photograph of the new U-M Soc-
cer Stadium. The message was
clear - it was time for this team to
mark its territory.
"When it showed our stadium
alongside some clips from last year
... that really motivated us to go out
and get that first win in our new

stadium," sophomore midfielder
Hamoody Saad said.
On top of that, Burns decided to
tack on some extra incentive for
the Wolverines (4-2-3) to capital-
ize early in their opener against
Detroit.
The coaching staff announced
that the player who netted the first
goal would get his name and the
ball enshrined in a glass case dis-
played in the soccer complex.
That was motivation enough to
get the offense buzzing from the
onset of the match. No one was
willing to let the opponent score
the illustrious first goal.
Sure enough, it was 28 min-
utes into the game when Ham-
oody's younger brother, freshman
Soony Saad dipped a free kick just
beneath the crossbar, etching him-
self permanently in the Michigan
history books.
"Everyonewants therecognition
ofscoringthatfirstgoal," Hamoody
said. "Everyone wants that ball, but
obviously in the end it was all about
going for the team's victory."
WOLVERINES ON TOP: Several
individuals - headlined by Soony
- have broken onto the national
scene over the last week, joining
the top ranks in the conference

and across the country.
A week after picking up his first
career hat trick, Soony was award-
ed Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of
the Week honors, a spot he shared
with Indiana forward Will Bruin.
Soony was also named to the Top-
DrawerSoccer.com National Team
of the Week.
Through nine games, he's
amassed seven of the team's 12 tal-
lies, currently putting him fourth
in the nation in goals scored.
Soony leads the conference in
shots taken (68), putting the Wol-
verines atop the Big Ten with 229
total shots.
On the other side of the field,
senior goalkeeper Chris Blais has
made 39 saves, which leads the Big
Ten.
THE MONTH AHEAD:In August,
the team headed to.northern Mich-
igan for a week of preseason work-
outs. The coaches split the team
into five groups and held compe-
titions to determine one winning
team at the end of the week.
on the final day, Burns took
his athletes to the Sleeping Bear
Dunes and gave them the final,
most difficult task.
"(They ran) from the base park
out to Lake Michigan and back,"

Burns said. "On that run there are
easily 20 big dunes that you have
got to climb. We really wanted to
paint a picture for them that the
dunes really represent the season
- there are a lot of ups and downs
in every season."
After losing a 1-0 match to cur-
rent-No. 19 Ohio State last Satur-
day, Michigan finds itself looking
up a towering dune in the sched-
ule.
The month of October will be an
enormous test to the team's endur-
ance and skill.
No. 24 Penn State comes to Ann
Arbor on Sunday, led by junior
Corey Hertzog - the conference's
leader in goals (8) and points (20).
But perhaps the biggest hurdle
will come when the Wolverines
travel to face currently unbeaten
and top-ranked Akron in three
weeks.
Sophomore goalkeeper David
Meves backstops the Zips, and
after setting a school record with
17 shutouts last year, Meves has yet
to allow a goal in the team's first
six matches this season.
A home game against another
ranked opponent, No. 11 Michigan
State, onOct. 30 closes out the dif-
fiim onth+fir Mirhicr

time during her first 12 games at
Michigan.
But she didn't waste her time on
the bench, observing and analyzing
the way opponents played, particu-
larly their defenses. It aided her in

Michigan wideouts fill in
gaps on explosive offense

Stonum, Roundtree,
Odoms and the
others are finding
their niche
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Every dog has his day. And for
the wide receivers on the Michi-
gan football team, the saying has
been all too real this season.
Against Massachusetts, it was
junior Darryl Stonum leading the
waywith 121 yards and two touch-
downs. Redshirt sophomore Roy
Roundtree had 118 yards of his
own last week against Bowling
Green.
And junior wideout Martavious
Odoms led the team with 91 yards
in the Wolverines' close win over
Notre Dame.
Additionally, redshirt junior
Junior Hemingway is back from
an injury and caught three passes
against the Falcons. And don't for-
get about the slot receivers, Ter-
rence Robinson, Kelvin Grady and
Jeremy Gallon, who are also in the
mix.
With the spotlight squarely on
sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson, Michigan's deepest
group has been trying to take the
pressure off of its quarterback.
"You never know when the ball
is going to come at you, at any
time," Stonum said on Monday.
"You never know who's going to
be the one having a big game. It's
fun, because everyone runs their
routes as hard as possible and on
any route, anyone can get the ball."
With the offensive reads up to
Robinson, he can choose to hand
the ball off, keep it himself or
throw to a wide receiver. He can
take what the defense gives him -
and Robinson has made it look like
child's play.
Bowling Green coach Dave
Clawson said that his scheme
was "trying to dare (Michigan) to
throw the ball."
In an attempt to stop the
dynamic Robinson on the ground,
the Falcons tried to get eight or
even nine defenders in the box
and have two people account for
Robinson - which left favorable
matchups for those Wolverine
wide receivers.
Robinson completed 4-of-4
passes for 60 yards including a
36-yarder to Roundtree on a seam
route toward the left sideline
before Robinson left the game
with a minor injury.
But it's the growth and devel-
opment of this group of receivers
- together with Robinson - that
has the offense running on all cyl-
inders.
Stonum said that over the sum-
mer the receivers and quarter-
backs worked on getting their
timing and route running down.
The goal was "that (the quarter-
backs) could do it with their eyes
closed," and that the receiver
would be in the correct spot.
There were a few times the quar-
terbacks did actually close their

learn Michigan coach Rich Rodri- He said it was that type of expe-

rience and playmaking ability that
allowed his offense to be so suc-
cessful at West Virginia. In 2007,
Pat White and Steve Slaton's last
year together as Mountaineers,
the offense threw for more than
2,000 yards and ran for more than
3,800 yards. Michigan is on pace
to surpass both of those marks.
And yes, extrapolating stats is
dangerous, especially since the
Wolverines haven't reached con-
ference play yet, but Robinson did
miss more than three quarters
against Bowling Green and the
offense is still on track to arguably
be one of Rodriguez's best.
It's an offense predicated on
playmakers making plays. Michi-
gan now has the playmakers to
surround Robinson and its up to
him to distribute. He certainly has
a lot of choices.
"Everyone's comfortable just
for the fact that everybody out
there wants to learn," Grady said.
"Everybody out there wants to
get better. Everybody out there
is waiting for their opportunity,
their 'Denard Robinson moment'
when they can be out there and
prove themselves right - that
they're able to come out and play,
that they're learning."

CONCERT PREVIEW

associate with the meticulous and
ornate sound
of Baroque The Route to

Catalan
musician Savall has been promot-
ing Medieval, Renaissance, and
Baroque music since the early
1970s. This Thursday, Savall will
make his third UMS appearance
in a concert at St. Francis of Assisi
Catholic Church exploring the
development of Hispanic music.
Armed with his trusty viola de
gamba (an early string instrument
related to the cello), Savall leads a
small army of ensembles and even
manages his own recording com-
pany.
"Jordi has brought to modern
ears very high-quality musical per-
formances of interesting and some-
times unknown, or little-known,
repertoire," said School of Music,
Theatre & Dance professor Louise
Stein, who has known Savall since
1979 and worked with him on sev-
eral occasions.
"As a solo viola de gamba player
Jordi is unmatched ... I think that's
where he's at his best."
For Thursday's concert, Savall
will lead a combined 20-person
ensemble consisting of singers,
guitarists and period-instrument
players. The group includes two of
Savall's ensembles specializing in
early Hispanic music. La Capella
Reial de Catalunya is an ensemble
made up of vocal soloists, while
Hesperion XXI is largely an instru-
mental group. Joining Savall's two

In 'Community,
NBC gets snarky

In second season,
comedy lets its
undeniable wit go
to its head
By ANDREW LAPIN
Senior Arts Editor
With only one full season
under their belt,
the writers of
NBC's "Commu-
nity" are already
starting to get ComiiUlty
a little full of season tv'
themselves -
an odd display Thursdays
of hubris from at 8 p.m.
a show that has NBC
yet to find true
ratings success.
In the season premiere, the study
group takes numerous potshots at
one of their network competitors,
the already infamous CBS failcom
"$#*! My Dad Says." And meta ref-
erence-happy fan favorite Abed
(Danny Pudi) stares right into the
face of both the camera and pro-
tagonist Jeff (Joel McHale) to tell
him why their lives are so differ-
ent from the ones on TV.
We get it. "Community" isn't
like anything else on the air right
now. This show's starting to turn

into that smart-ass kid in your
lecture hall who won't shut up
about the A he scored on the last
exam. But hey, that kid is still a
pro at what he does.
Greendale devotees may recall
how the end of last season mean-
dered into mushy territory: The
finale concluded with cynical
former lawyer Jeff sucking face
with Bambi-eyed high school
dropout Annie (Alison Brie) mere
moments after an emotional Brit-
ta (Gillian Jacobs) professed her
love to him in front of the entire
school. Love triangles? Cliffhang-
ers? Feelings? Was this really the
same show that only a few weeks
prior had staged an episode-
lengthshomage to cheesy action
movies?
Indeed, Abed speaks for all ofus
when he demands wild and crazy
adventures every week instead of
gooey love stuff. But luckily for
us and him, "Community" quick-
ly eschews any preconceived
notions as to how this standard
plotline would normally play out.
Instead, Jeff and Britta attempt to
publicly out-smother each other
with affection ina power struggle
for the school's "spurned lover"
sympathy. The game of lip-chick-
en they play with each other in
class makes for an amazing bit of
physical comedy.
If these guys win more real-

world fans thanks to the pre-
miere's unabashedly gimmicky
Betty White stunt casting, it
won't be because of White herself.
She's shockingly unfunny here as
an unhinged anthropology pro-
fessor, and can't quite land the
delivery of lines like "More of my
own urine for me." Though the
octogenarian contributes nicely
to a brand-new rap from Abed
and Troy (Donald Glover), on the
whole her presence serves most-
ly to reinforce the show's main
strength: that this truly gifted
core cast could destroy any other
sitcom's rotating stable of guest
stars in pure laughs measured
(here's looking at you, "Big Bang
Theory").
It's wise for a show that rose to
must-watch status as quickly as
"Community" to exercise some
restraint, and here the characters
remain grounded enough for us
to care about them - we feel for
the group when Jeff's sexual esca-
pades threaten to tear them apart.
That said, "Community" is still
at its best when it's at its crazi-
est, and here's hoping for a season
full of pop-culture throwbacks,
Troy-and-Abed absurdity and an
unhealthy amount of fourth-wall
breaking.
But mostly, here's hoping more
people watch. After all, there's
nothing else like it on TV.

TRAILER REVIEW

"I am about to embark on a
great adven-
ture," intones
the preteen des-
perado played by True Grit
newcomer Hailee
Steinfeld at the Paramount
openingofthe new
trailer for the Coen brothers' "True
Grit." You gotthat right, pardner.
In the breathtaking one-minute
spot for the remake of the 1969 John
Wayne classic, due in theaters this
Christmas, images of rustic, unfor-
giving Manifest Destiny wilderness
pop with the unmistakable visual
aesthetic of the greatest filmmak-
ers working today. An eyepatched
Jeff Bridges wields a pair of old-
timey pistols on horseback, while
a mustachioed and scary-looking

Josh Brolin glowers from his porch
and a blink-and-you'll-miss-him
Matt Damon lurks from afar. And
all the while, the haunting melody
of a bluegrass children's choir takes
the creepiest parts of "0 Brother,
Where Art Thou?" and makes them
awesome.
Joel and Ethan Coen are on an
unprecedented winning streak -
like Woody Allen, they've been
putting out one film a year for four
years now. Unlike Woody Allen,
these movies are actually worth
watching. Does "True Grit" seem,
on first impression, to hew a little
too close to the formula of the
Coen's 2007 Best Picture winner
"No Country for Old Men"? Yes.
And your point is?

Of all the singles by all the arti-

synthetically
fabulous electro-
wail "Call the
Shots" by Girls Fyfe

the singers, take Dangerfield
oddball crooner "Calithe Shots"
Fyfe Danger-
field, whose Polydor
main attraction,
Guillemots, is anything but fake
with two LPs of quirky, heartfelt,
bird-themed tunes. Put the ,two
together, and what do you get?
Dangerfield's cover of "Call the
Shots," which distinguishes itself
from the original immediately, com-
ing in with shy audible guitar pick-
ing and an organic thumping beat.

Where the original Girls Aloud
song came off as a mechanized
don't-need-you toss-off, Danger-
field's version has strings attached
- literally, when an overemotional
violin comes in with repeated piz-
zicato pluckings and strung-out
sweeps, and figuratively, from his
emotional wail as he blares out
the chorus in an about-to-break
voice. Suddenly, lines like "it real-
ly doesn't faze me how you spend
your time" have a painful edge,
as if Dangerfield is putting up an
unaffected front over a lovelorn
melancholy. And just like that, a
poppy nonsense song becomes so
much more than that. Those crazy
girl groups ain't got nothin' on
this.

EPISODE REVIEW

Dexter Morgan just can't catch
a break. The
moment he thinks *
he's rid the world
of an evil serial Dexter
killer (not him seas f ive
- someone else)
he comes home "My Bad"
to find (GIANT Showtime
SPOILER ALERT)
his wife Rita dead in the bathtub.
Season five shows us a vulnerable,
confused, and even emotional Dex-
ter, but is that really the hero anyone
wants from the dark opus? In every
episode of "Dexter," there needs to
be some sense of real danger. There's
always an emotional journey, sure,
but there's also that element of action
and suspense that keeps viewers
hooked and worrying for Dexter's

well-being. For an entire episode to
follow the dismemberer's emotional
journey leaves the show feeling a
little empty. If you stopped watching
five minutes into the episode then
tuned back in for the final scene,
you wouldn't have missed anything
important. If the entire season is
going to be full of Dexter changing
his mind and ending up back where
he started, it'll be a pointless hole in
the series' otherwise stellar run.
But plot stagnancy aside, the
writing is still solid and brooding,
and Quinn is finally getting a chance
to both hook up with Deborah (final-
ly!) and make himself a notable pres-
ence on the police force. This just
better not be another season of pure
Dexter-hunting.

Rapping with
'U' student MCs
Students explore two facets of rap - improvisational
freestyling and composed rhymes.
They talk about process, product and flow.
By Jennifer Xu II Daily Arts writer

Ding is about more than just playing a few good songs in a row.

DJ
From Page 1B
A couple of bad gigs didn't stop
Wade from continuing to pursue
DJing as a career.
"Every DJ has had a bad gig," he
said. "Maybe people weren't show-
ing up, or you weren't feeling it that
night. You just take it in stride. You
have to accept those things are
going to happen. You just have to
let it ride. You just smile and just
keep pushing through."
While Wade kept busy in
Buchanan - a small town in
Michigan with just under 5,000
residents - playing house shows
in his friends' basements, it wasn't
until his move to Ann Arbor that
things really began to pick up.
"(It wasn't) until I moved to
Ann Arbor that I really got seri-
ous with the DJing. Then I started
doing mixed shows for WCBN," he
said.
His set with WCBN helped open
the gates to many opportunities,
including getting the European
tour circuit. Wade waxed nostal-
gic on "the good old days" of Ann
Arbor, more than a decade prior to
its current scene.
"I haven't played in Ann Arbor
since the year 2000. It's been at
least 10 years. It's probably been
just as long since I've hung out in
Ann Arbor." he said.
"It was good back in the day
though. Everything was new back
then. All the big dogs were DJing
around in the city. I was just a
youngpup looking around with big

eyes."
Not everyone has found the Ann
Arbor scene as accommodating as
Wade. While Wade considers the
city as a "breeding ground" for his
artistic growth, Billetdeaux finds
the city much less of a nurturing
atmosphere.
Billetdeaux chose to keep him-
self under wraps for a few months
to practice privately in order to
hone his DJ techniques.
"There were probably three
or four months that I devoted to
practice. I didn't get gigs right
away," Billetdeaux said. "Me and
my friend Brandon DJ'd at Cantina
last summerffor two months. It was
OK. It was playing pop music for a
fratty college crowd. It was fun. I
got a lot of experience playing for
a crowd. It wasn't ultimately the
kind of music I wanted to play, but
Igot a lot out of it."
Billetdeaux's main concern is
with the city itself. In his view,
there simply aren't venues avail-
able for the type of music he wants
to play.
"I think the biggest setback has
been Ann Arbor. There's not real-
ly a crowd for the kind of music I
really play. Or if there is, I don't
really know where it is," he said.
The ideal kind of music Bil-
letdeaux wishes he could play?
"Experimental" would be one
word for it.
"Not the club bangers you'd hear
at Necto," he said. "I would really
love to create a scene in Ann Arbor
for the kind of music I really love
to play. Because right now it just
doesn't exist."
His musical preferences vary,

depending on his mood, but always
veer on the side of eccentric.
"I love all things house music.
My musical tastes shift really
frequently. One minute I might
really, be into dubstep; the next,
trippy-ass new school beats. Defi-
nitely more dance-focused, house-
focused," Billetdeaux said.
His preference for the eclectic
is apparent in the type of gigs he
signs up for.
"My first gig was at Sigma Phi. I'
was friends with a couple brothers
and they asked me ifI wanted to do
it. I put a bug in their ear and they
finally asked me. It was an '80s aer-
obics party two years ago," he said.
Billetdeaux's primary moti-
vation for DJing, like Wade and
Wells, is for people to enjoy the
music.
"I mean honestly, most places
that I DJ don't have money to pay.
I didn't get into it to make money; I
did it to play music for people who
wanted to hear some cool stuff," he
said. "I think it's really fun to make
people dance. Give people a good
time."
Wade feels the same way. The
crowd's energy and the music itself
is his favorite part about DJing.
"I really like to interact with
the crowd. I feed off of that, and
they feed off of that. It's like a
high without doing drugs to get
it," Wade said. "Music itself is just
something that I'm into, that I love.
And if I'm into something, I do my
homework on it. It's like an odys-
sey. You find one artist you like and
then you get turned onto a differ-
ent group. It's like branches on a
tree - it connects."

The next time you hear rap
booming from a house party or
a passing car, stop and check out
whose vocals are being blasted. It
could be a rich professional rap-
per bragging about his new ride,
but don't assume - it just might
be a University student. While no
club survives to support campus
rappers, a few young creatives
have made this form of rhythmic
vocalization their own, whether
through recordings or freestyle.
For Jonathan Hornstein, a
junior in the Ross School of Busi-
ness, rapping has become part of
his weekly routine.
"I definitely don't go around
to people saying, 'Hi, my name is
Jon. I'm a rapper,' but it's become
one of my most prominent hob-
bies," he said. "It's on my resume
- under my additional hobbies,
it says that I enjoy rapping. So I
would say that most people who
know me know that I like to rap."
Hornstein first got into rap on
a high school backpacking trip to
Scotland in his sophomore year.
"My counselor was really into
hip hop," he said. "So we'd be rid-
ing around in this van listening to
hip-hop music and I kind of fell in
love with it."
To date, Hornstein has written
and recorded nine songs together
with his DJ friend, bearing names
such as "Fly Me to the Moon"
(which samples the Sinatra song),
"The Song I Never Wrote You"
and "Confused."
"What happens first is that
we'll think of the concept - some
song that we'll sample with a cer-
tain beat," Hornstein said. "You'll
listen to the beat, play around
with the speed and you'll sort of
get in your mind this is how the
flow should be going. You develop
a sort of rhythm sense, then based
on that, you'll start writing the
rap to get that rhythm sense."
Hornstein keeps certain things
in his mind while writing and
recording the rap, such as rhythm,
breath control, enunciation and
rhyme.

"You need to make an impact
on the song because even though
these days a lot of what people pay
attention to is what's behind the
rap - the beat - you want to make
sure your rhythm and flow is add-
ing to the song," Hornstein said.
A common misconception
about rapping is that the words
have to precisely rhyme.
"Sometimes what's more
important is that the vowels have
the same sound. For instance,
break rhymes with 'steak.' But in a
rap song, you could rhyme 'break'
with 'crate.' The rhyming diction-
ary wouldn't pick that up, so you
really have to develop that kind of
innate sense," he said.
Although Hornstein does not
usually engage in freestyling -
the completely improvisational
act of rapping off the top of your
head - others, like LSA junior
Erik Torenberg, do.
Torenberg got into freestyl-
ing last winter after watching
the documentary "Freestyle: The
Art of Rhyme," which features
a wide array of popular rappers,
including Mos Def, Eminem
and Tupac. After showing it to a
group of his friends, among them
LSA senior Jeff Koelzer, they all
started freestyling whenever they
were together, whether they were
walking to classes or going to a
party.
"A lot of the time it happens in
the kitchen of a house party wait-
ing in line for some jungle juice,"
Koelzer said. "And that's when
we'll break out. It's such a spec-
tacle when it happens."
"At a party there's these cycles
- and when there's downs, you
start something and mix it up,"
Torenberg added. "And now it's
kind of become our thing when
we're out, and we want to spice it
up."
Traditionally called a cypher,
the group will go from one person
to another, rapping with nothing
but an amateur beatbox beat and
their own voices.
"A lot of it is just completely

losing yourself," Torenberg said.
"We include everyone, even peo-
ple who have never done it before.
You justsay exactly what's onyour
mind, and you don't stop - there's
no good or bad. It's all about fun.
And we all bounce off each other."
Beginner freestylers frequently
engage in the use of the pocket
rhymes - the term for a rhyme
that the rapper has done before
that is already in his head.
"You can do pocket rhymes if
you're stuck," Torenberg said. But
as the group gets better and bet-
ter, they try to minimize the prac-
tice.
"We just started, so we're just
trying to get words out. When you
get good is when you start telling
stories," he added.
Still, Torenberg and Koelzer
have fun rapping about whatever
is going on around them, from
John Locke and economics terms
to the party they're at.
"What I like about freestyle
is the literal transformation -
regurgitation - of exactly what's
on your mind. You literally can't
think of anything else besides the
rapping," Torenberg said.
"I'm not very good, but I get
amazed at myself at what comes
out," Koelzer added. "It's so
coherent - you're not consciously
aware of it, but it's the power of
your subconscious mind when
we're all together like that."
Torenberg admitted that it was
the act of freestyling that really
drew him into it, not necessarily
the product that came out.
"For me I love it because it's
such a different work than school.
If I have a headache from doing
too much work, whenyou rap, you
just completely lose it," he said.
"You just have no inhibitions and
then you just go. If it's not clari-
fying, it's very liberating. A com-
plete outlet."
While for Torenberg the rap
ends once the words come out,
Hornstein's rapping process is
more lengthy. After having to

in poetry everything else is sec-
ondary to sound. Even a poet as
brainy and difficult as T. S. Eliot
remarked that experiencing poet-
ry is more a bodily process than
an intellectual one. This is why I
have complained about teachers
who show their students a poem
and immediately ask, "What does
it mean?"
Because the answer is always:
lots of things. For instance, when
I read this line by the new poet
laureate, W. S. Merwin:
This is the black sea-brute
bulling through wave-wrack,
The sense-maker in me tries
to grasp the literal situation - a
huge sea creature swimming -
and, an instant later, the graduate
student in me starts to recognize
that Merwin is playing on the.
alliterative verse of the Anglo-
Saxons, the meter of Beowulf.
But none of this is worth think-
ing about if the line isn't first
musical, if I don't delight to hear
the plosive B sounds urging the

I may not want that read to me
on my deathbed, but I'm not about
to say it's not poetry.
As we reach adolescence, many
of us tend to care less about creat-
ing intriguing sounds than about
being understood, mostly because
we don't understand ourselves.
The poetry we write - my own
high school notebooks confirm
it - gets a bit melodramatic. We
don't want someone to ask us
what we mean; we want someone
already to understand. That need
never goes away.
By then too many of us, even
some who want to write our own
poems, have already given up on
reading poetry. What a shame
this is, because in those books
the miracle of being understood
has already quietly happened.
Someone has understood and even
made the understanding beauti-
ful, which is all a reluctant reader
could ask for, or that an aspiring
writer could hope for.

RAP
From Page 3B
physically write the rap, he also
needs to practice performing it, all
the while keepingthe key aspectof
flow in mind.
"Flow is something that's hard
to define," Hornstein said. "A lot
of people say that rap isn't really
a talent because you're just say-

ing the words. But really where
you can sort of tell that's not true
is that if you listen to someone
who's good at rap, you really hear
a rhythm, and people say it flows.
'Flow' is sort of the rhythmic
speaking of the words."
The freestylers, however, beg to
differ - they don't have an overly-
ing classification for the word.
"Don't know, don't think about
it. Just think it sounds cool. A
melody plus words equals 'flow,'"

Torenberg said.
"We always use it in our free-
styles. I don't think it has a defini-
tion. There's this consistent facade
of rappers saying'Oh, I got flow, you
don'tunderstand,that's howitgoes.'
Nobody knows," Koelzer added.
Torenberg's group of friends
said they do not engage in rap
battles.
"We're not too contentious
about the whole thing. It's so easy
to go up and come up with differ-

ent insults that you have in your
pocket and say them to someone
- they're pocket rhymes that you
could say to anybody," Koelzer
said.
Hornstein does not do rap bat-
tles either - in fact, he doesn't
even do a lot of freestyling.
"I cannot freestyle. I wish I
could - I'm not that big of a free-
styler," Hornstein admitted. "By
virtue of me knowing how to rap,
I have a lot of rhymes in my head.

I can think of stuff to put in the
rhymes, but the raps don't really
make any sense."
"They talk about this a lot in the
documentary ('Freestyle'). When
someone is good at one they're not
good at the other, for some rea-
son," Torenberg said.
"With (recorded) rapping,
because you have all the time in
the world when you're writing
things down, it's more important
that you are creative than fast

about it," Hornstein said.
On the other hand, freestyling
is all about the process behind it -
no recordings, no written words,
just beats and sounds.
"For us, there is no final prod-
uct. The final product is the pro-
cess," Torenberg said. "The art
is really about bringing every-
one together. It's about creating
moments of heightened awareness
at moments where there ordinar-
ily wouldn't be."
