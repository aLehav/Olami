ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Ypsilanti is following Ann 
Arbor’s lead in drafting a plan 
to achieve carbon neutrality 
by the year 2035. 
On Tuesday, Nov. 19, the 
Ypsilanti City Council decided 
to draft a plan on how the city 
could become carbon neutral 
in 15 years. The draft plan 
will be presented on March 
31, 
approaching 
the 
50th 
anniversary of Earth Day.
The Ann Arbor City Council 
pursued a similar course in 
early November in an effort 
to respond to the climate 
crisis. In a Nov. 4 Ann Arbor 
City Council meeting, the 
council unanimously declared 
a state of emergency, passing a 
resolution outlining a goal of 
achieving carbon neutrality 
by 2030. Ann Arbor will also 
be revealing its draft plan for 
achieving carbon neutrality 
around Earth Day next year. 
Washtenaw 
County 
declared a local and global 
climate emergency on Sept.18. 
As of Wednesday night, the 
county allocated $30,000 in 
funding to hire a consultant 
to 
complete 
greenhouse 
gas inventory as part of the 
county’s 
plan 
to 
counter 

climate change. 
These 
new 
carbon 
neutrality resolutions were 
met with cautious optimism by 
the current councilmembers. 
City officials from Ann Arbor 
and Ypsilanti were both wary 
of the ambitious nature of the 
plans.
Ypsilanti officials voiced 
their 
concerns 
about 
the 
lack of resources available 
to 
Ypsilanti 
compared 
to 
Ann Arbor — specifically in 
developing a thorough carbon 
neutrality draft in only three 
and a half months.
During 
a 
city 
council 
meeting 
on 
Nov. 
4, 
Ann 
Arbor City Councilmember 
Ali Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, said 
he was concerned about the 
likelihood of the Ann Arbor 
actually achieving these goals.
“All you’ve got is your word 
in this life,” Ramlawi said. 
“And we’re never going to hit 
these targets the way we are 
moving on these other issues.”
Ramwali’s 
concerns 
about city council were not 
unfounded. The following city 
council meeting, the members 
debated introducing carbon-
neutral aspects to provisions 
for affordable housing.

City declares efforts to fight climate change 
by achieving net-zero emissions by 2035, 
following Ann Arbor’s lead in drafting plan

The Gerald R. Ford School 
of Public Policy hosted four 
former U.S. ambassadors for 
the talk “The U.S., Iran, and 
Security in the Persian Gulf,” 
the final installment in the 
school’s 
Weiser 
Diplomacy 
Center Series, on Thursday.
Michael 
Barr, 
the 
dean 
of the Ford school, stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
“Conversations 
Across 
Differences” 
series 
in 
developing relationships with 
those of differing backgrounds.
“Practicing diplomacy both 
abroad and here at home is 
essential for working through 
moments 
where 
differences 
seem 
insurmountable,” 
Barr 
said.
The 
topics 
discussed 
varied from the Gulf states’ 
perceptions of Iran, to the 
effects of the power dynamics 
in the Gulf on the United States, 
to the relationship between the 
U.S. and Iran, especially since 
the U.S. has no embassy there. 
Instead, Switzerland has acted 
as mediator between the two 
countries since 1979 following 
the Iranian Revolution.

Author examines intersection of relationships, carceral state

Author and activist Ebony 
Roberts joined Ashley Lucas, 
former director of the Prison 
Creative 
Arts 
Project, 
to 
discuss 
Roberts’s 
memoir 
about falling in love with a 
man who was incarcerated, 
“The Love Prison Made and 
Unmade: My Story.” A crowd 

of about 50 people attended 
the event at the Ann Arbor 
District Library on Thursday.
Roberts 
received 
a 
doctorate 
in 
educational 
psychology from Michigan 
State 
University. 
She 
formed a deep bond with 
Shaka 
Senghor, 
who 
is 
formerly incarcerated, over 
the course of his last four 
years 
of 
incarceration 
of 

his 20-year sentence. They 
co-parent a child together, 
and 
though 
they 
are 
no 
longer together, they still 
work very closely in their 
professional 
relationship. 
Roberts started a private 
publishing company to help 
publish the books Senghor 
wrote 
while 
incarcerated, 
as well as helped with other 
needs that Senghor had while 

incarcerated.
Roberts and Lucas spoke 
to the audience about their 
history as long-time friends 
as well as collaborators while 
discussing 
how 
Roberts 
prepared 
herself 
for 
this 
book. Roberts said she never 
thought she would be writing 
a book, due to her primarily 
writing dissertations. 
“I never intended to write 

this book. The book was 
initially going to be a ‘he said, 
she said’ (with Shaka); Shaka 
is a writer, I’m a writer, and 
we had discussed writing a 
book together about our love 
story and how we met and fell 
in love.” Roberts said, “(but) 
after Shaka came home, we 
published his memoir about 
his life before he went to 
prison and his transformation 

in prison, and he had spoken 
a little on our relationship, 
and it was almost like, ‘Okay, 
well, that’s sort of been told, 
we don’t need to rehash the 
story.’ … (Shaka said,) ‘I’ve 
already told the story from 
my perspective, I think you 
should still tell the story, but 
from your perspective.”

Hundreds 
of 
students, 
professors and Ann Arbor 
community members packed 
into the Michigan Theater 
to 
hear 
renowned 
artist 
Edel 
Rodriguez 
speak 
at 
the 
last 
“Penny 
Stamps 
Distinguished 
Speaker 

Series” of the semester on 
Thursday. Rodriguez is a 
contributor to the New York 
Times and the New Yorker, 
and has created numerous 
book, magazine and film 
covers and posters over the 
years.
In an interview with The 
Michigan Daily, director of 
the Penny Stamps Speaker 

Series, Chrisstina Hamilton, 
detailed what the series is and 
how Rodriguez represents an 
artist in the field.
“When 
it 
started, 
the 
idea 
was 
to 
bring 
real 
practitioners working out in 
the world in art and design so 
that students would be able 
to … learn from people who 
are successful practitioners 

rather than just academics,” 
Hamilton said. “(Rodriguez) 
is highly successful, very 
well published and a highly 
regarded 
illustrator 
and 
graphic designer, and graphic 
design is a big pursuit of 
a lot of our students, as is 
illustration.”

compared 
the 
diplomatic 
tactics of President Barack 
Obama and President Donald 
Trump, 
pointing 
out 
that 
Obama focused on specific 

behavioral 
concerns 
while 
Trump’s approach has been 
to 
apply 
an 
unmanageable 
amount of pressure, which 
Feirstein said has not worked.

Feierstein said he holds out 
hope that the two countries 
will be willing to have a 
peaceful discussion in order to 
start moving forward.

“Both sides gingerly are 
interested in finding a way to 
get back to the table,” he said. 
“Both sides recognize that a 
train wreck kills a lot of people, 

including the engineers.”
However, 
Ronald 
E. 
Neumann, former ambassador 
to 
Algeria, 
Bahrain 
and 
Afghanistan, said he does not 
share 
Feierstein’s 
positive 
outlook.
“Optimism 
is 
free, 
so 
one might as well indulge,” 
Neumann 
replied, 
sparking 
a round of laughter from 
the audience and the other 
panelists, including Feierstein.
Deborah 
McCarthy, 
who 
served as an ambassador to 
Lithuania from 2013 to 2016, 
commented on the usefulness 
of sanctions, provided they are 
used appropriately.
“Sanctions are an effective 
tool if you outline clearly 
the behavior that you want 
to change,” McCarthy said. 
“Intent 
is 
really 
for 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
state 
to 
change.”
Public 
Policy 
junior 
Karuna Nandkumar said she 
understands how important 
navigating those differences 
can be, especially considering 
her 
career 
ambitions 
in 
international diplomacy.

Callie Rouse, CGIS health 
and safety assistant, and Annie 
Haroun, director of Active 
Minds, a student-led mental 
health advocacy group, hosted 
a panel at the Hatcher Graduate 
Library Thursday to discuss 
the effects of study abroad on 
mental health. 
Among 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students, 
anxiety, 
depression, 
self-esteem, 
academic 
concerns 
and 
relationships are the leading 
mental health concerns, the 
panelists 
said. 
Rouse 
and 
Haroun discussed the pressures 
study-abroad 
students 
face 
and how they impact existing 
mental health conditions. 

“Students are dealing with 
things 
like 
different 
laws, 
languages, 
diets, 
cultural 
norms, 
social 
expectations, 
living situations, that they’re 
new and unfamiliar with and 
these can be stressors for 
people,” Rouse said. 
Rouse also noted there is an 
ideal surrounding study abroad, 
which can be misinterpreted 
as a “magic cure” for people 
with 
mental 
health. 
While 
study abroad may help, Rouse 
said people still have the same 
mentalities abroad they do at 
home. It takes time and effort 
to adjust to new environments, 
according to Rouse. 
“You don’t leave yourself 
at home,” Rouse said. “It’s 
important to be really mindful 
about how you’re going to 

handle your mental health, it 
may be a new environment, but 
there’s still new challenges that 
come with that environment.”
Haroun 
emphasized 
the 
importance of studying the 
attitudes toward mental health 
in different countries before 
going there. She elaborated 
that, in her own experience 
abroad in Prague, mental health 
was not openly discussed in 
conversation, and she wished 
she had known that prior. 
“Just because (a) particular 
country 
doesn’t 
talk 
about 
mental health, that doesn’t 
mean that it’s not important 
and that you should be hiding 
it,” Rouse said. “It’s all about 
realizing 
that 
people 
are 
going through similar things 
to you, and you shouldn’t be 
afraid to practice mental 
health even though you’re 
abroad.” 
Rouse also stressed the 
importance of scheduling 
medications 
beforehand, 
especially since different 
countries 
have 
varying 
laws pertaining to which 
drugs are allowed there. 
Therefore, she said it’s 
important to get enough 
doses prior, as well as 
to talk to a therapist or 
physician about a mental 
health plan to prepare for 
challenges that may arise 
abroad. 
Rouse then addressed 
how 
one 
can 
prepare 
for 
study 
abroad. 
She 
mentioned that managing 
one’s 
expectations 
is 
one way of making sure 
stresses 
are 
handled 
properly when things don’t 
go as well as anticipated. 
Haroun cited different 
resources 
that 
students 
can and should access, 
such as CGIS, friends, the 
LSA Health and Safety 

team and counseling on site.
“For me, the biggest resource 
I used was friends,” Haroun 
said. “Although it can be really 
tough to ultimately confide 
in people because you’re in a 
totally different environment, 
I think it’s really important 
to note that everyone’s in the 
same place as you.” 
Rouse introduced a number 
of panelists to speak on their 
experiences abroad. 
LSA 
student 
Graysen 
Colpaert, 
who 
studied 
abroad with Global Course 
Connections in Japan, said she 
felt a little unprepared going 
into her program, but she 
utilized the resources available 
and had a good experience 
overall. 
“I 
didn’t 
realize 
what 
impact study abroad has on 
your mental health,” Colpaert 
said. “But there are resources 
available there for you to use, 
and that was a big part of 
getting through it for me, and 
it was ultimately a really good 
experience, and I wouldn’t 
trade it for the world.”
Haroun said one of the 
challenges she faced abroad 
was the pressure to make a 
routine for herself that fit 
absolutely 
everything 
she 
wanted to explore in Europe. 
She said social media worsened 
the pressure she felt because 
she found herself comparing 
herself to her friends.
“Although 
social 
media 
shows that everyone is happy, 
that’s really not the case,” 
Haroun 
said. 
“Everyone’s 
having ups and downs abroad, 
especially your friends, and it’s 
just the fact that your friends 
aren’t the ones that are talking 
about those hard times while 
they’re abroad.”

BE HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomores Barbara 
Collins and Ben Rosenfeld reported on community backlash 
surrounding a fraternity’s Larry Nassar-related banner displayed 
during a football game against Michigan State University.

“I think it had a very big impact on the University and its students 
as a whole. As a student newspaper, our core priority should be to 
be reflecting student opinion and voices, and this was definitely 
something that was being talked about on campus. So, having the 
opportunity to share that, I think it’s a very important issue to bring to 
light.”

Barbara Collins, Daily Staff Reporter

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
When someone has been sexually assaulted, they feel a sense of 
powerlessness and that’s one of the big reasons why people report: to 
take back their power and stand up to their perpetrator. When a 
university allows a perpetrator to cross-examine their victim, the 
university is in effect allowing that perpetrator to have power over the 
victim again and I consider that to be cruel.”

LSA sophomore Emma Sandberg, speaking during a protest of the University of Michigan’s interim Title IX policy

“I had the opportunity to 
spend last summer interning 
at 
the 
U.S. 
Embassy 
in 
Mexico City,” Nandkumar 
said. “Learning about other 
cultures, other people and 
the politics of other countries 
has always been something 
that’s 
really 
interesting 
to me. I’m focusing in the 
Ford School in diplomacy 
and international security 

issues, and I hope to go into 
that field.” 
When asked for advice on 
how students interested in 
international affairs can best 
prepare themselves for such 
careers, Former ambassador 
to Qatar Patrick Theros had 
a 
simple 
yet 
meaningful 
answer.
“Succeed at what you’re 
doing right now,” Theros 
said.

This 
resolution 
was 
rejected 
6-5, 
with 
Councilmembers 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1; Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1; Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward 2; Jack 
Eaton, 
D-Ward 
4; 
and 
Nelson supporting it. 
LSA senior Dim Mang is 
involved with the Climate 
Action 
Movement 
and 
said she worries the city 

council is not supporting 
the climate neutrality plan 
with concrete actions. 
“I think that you can 
support it in theory and 
then 
talk 
as 
much 
as 
you’d like … but if you’re 
not actually going to go 
through on, you know, 
housing plans for things 
like that, their activism 
and their advocacy is not 
enough,” Mang said.

The 
lecture 
began 
with a 15-minute film 
that detailed Rodriguez’s 
immigration to the United 
States, 
his 
upbringing 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
his Cuban heritage and 
how these factors have 
informed and inspired his 
art over the years.
At the age of nine, 
Rodriguez 
immigrated 
to the United States as a 
part of the Mariel boatlift 
— a mass immigration 
in 1980 of Cubans who 
departed 
from 
Mariel 
Harbor for the United 
States — and grew up in 
Miami, Florida. He then 
attended Pratt Institute 
in Brooklyn, 
New 
York. 
Rodriguez 
said 
his 
struggles 
earlier 
on 
in 
his 
life 
defined what 
kind of artist 
he was, and 
that he has 
overcome 
those 
struggles.
“When 
I 
was 
in 
college, I was 
always 
told 
you have to 
pick a focus,” 
Rodriguez 
said. 
“What 
are you? Are 
you a painter? 
Are 
you 
a 
designer? 
Are 
you 
an 
illustrator? 
What 
are 
you? … And 
you’re always pressured 
to choose a decision about 
who you are … and for the 
past 25 years, I’ve done 
everything.”
In 
recent 
years, 
Rodriguez 
has 
gained 
fame and notoriety for 
his 
politically 
charged 
magazine 
covers, 
specifically the covers for 
TIME and Der Spiegel. 
Covers depicting Donald 
Trump’s face melting, or 
Donald Trump holding 
the head of the Statue 
of Liberty in one hand 
and a knife in another 
have drawn widespread 
media 
coverage 
and 
international 
attention. 
He 
spoke 
about 
the 
influence he has seen 
his covers have on the 
general public.
“I’ve 
done 
probably 
about 
150 
magazine 
covers,” Rodriguez said. 
“The first time I noticed 
a magazine cover could 
have a lot of impact was 
when I did this cover for 
Communication Arts. … It 
became a very big cover 
worldwide 
and 
started 
a lot of discussions. … 
People in Cuba used to 

put it in a paper bag and 
pass it around because 
they could not show it in 
public.”
He then talked about 
his controversial covers 
portraying Donald Trump 
and 
why 
he 
decided 
to take such a strong 
political stance in 2016.
“What I saw in Trump 
as a candidate was, from 
what I had experienced 
in Cuba and the type of 
language 
Fidel 
Castro 
had used … these were the 
same things that Trump 
was saying as a candidate, 
and it freaked me out,” 
Rodriguez 
said. 
“Both 
of these covers ended up 
everywhere.” 
The 
depictions 
of 
Trump 
that 
Rodriguez 
created have been seen 
at political rallies and 
protests 
all 
over 
the 
United States, 
from 
New 
York City to 
Denver to San 
Francisco. 
He has been 
covered 
by 
CNN, 
MSNBC, 
and 
was 
even 
dubbed 
“Trump’s 
most 
hated 
artist.” While 
these 
covers 
have 
given 
Rodriguez 
attention, not 
all of it has 
been positive. 
He 
showed 
the audience 
pictures 
of 
hate messages 
he 
had 
received

“This 
guy 
asked me if I was illegal, 
and 
I’ve 
been 
here 
for 
almost 
40 
years,” 
Rodriguez said. “And 
I’ve never been asked this 
question … I get direct 
emails, threats, all sorts 
of things.”
Throughout 
the 
lecture, Rodriguez was 
interrupted by laughter, 
cheering or a mixture of 
both despite the grave 
nature of many of his 
subjects. As it ended, the 
auditorium broke out into 
raucous applause.
Art & Design junior 
Gwen McCartney related 
to 
Rodriguez’s 
relaxed 
approach to his artistic 
endeavors, 
even 
when 
dealing with heavy topics.
“In my art, I don’t 
like to take myself too 
seriously,” 
McCartney 
said. “I think with his 
work, I found that he had 
very serious subjects, but 
I felt like he was kind 
of nonchalant about the 
stuff he did … which I 
really appreciate.”

LSA 
senior 
Ethan 
Szlezinger told The Daily 
Roberts’ 
book 
and 
her 
perspective 
really 
drew 
him in.
“I 
was 
surprised 
by 
the specific details that 
somebody who’s in that 
situation could only know,” 
Szlezinger 
said. 
“For 
example, when she was 
talking about the carpools 
and 
the 
transportation 
to 
get 
to 
the 
prisons 
(for 
visitations), 
that’s 
something that somebody 
outside of the prison system 
doesn’t know about and 
would just never consider.” 
Lucas 
noted 
the 
perspective that Roberts’s 
memoir 
adds 
to 
the 
rhetoric 
around 
fighting 
back against the prison 
industrial complex. 
“You can get a sense 
from reading about her 
that she is a woman of 
remarkable fortitude, and 
resourcefulness — that she 
has strong principles and 
is brave enough to take a 
stand against the prison 
industrial complex, which 
severely diminishes all of 
our lives, whether we know 
it or not,” Lucas said.
While 
Roberts 
accompanied Senghor on 
his tour promoting his book 
“Writing My Wrongs: Life, 
Death, and Redemption in 
an American Prison,” she 
said people kept asking her 
for her side of the story and 
were urging her to write 
about her experience as 
his partner. She said she 
was nervous to write a 
memoir because it was an 
unfamiliar format, as it was 
one that asked for a lot of 
emotional transparency.
“At that point, it was 
almost as if, you know, the 
universe was pushing me 
to tell the story because it 
needed to be told, that there 
were people who needed 
to hear my story and who 
could get something out of 
it,” Roberts said.
Senghor 
and 
Roberts 
began a deeply committed 
relationship that involved 
hundreds 
of 
letters, 
expensive phone calls and 
visitations that required a 
sometimes eight- to 10-hour 
drive. 
Roberts 
said 
she 
found support from online 
forums, and she spoke to 
how this allowed her to 
feel less isolated during 
these years. In terms of 

the letters they exchanged, 
Roberts 
explained 
how 
detailed and eloquent the 
two made their letters and 
how this contributed to 
the way their relationship 
functioned.
“Our 
letters 
were 
extremely long in detail, 
and tight, most of them 
— and I mean eight to 10 
pages, sometimes longer. 
And so, we got to know each 
other in ways that we don’t 

typically get to know each 
other because — especially 
now with social media, 
email, 
text 
messaging, 
really 
anything 
quick,” 
Roberts said. “We’re not 
even on the phone as much 
as we used to be, so the 
letters were an integral 
part of getting to know 
each other and our intimate 
thoughts and being able to 
really share.” 
Roberts said one year 
their calls cost $3,000. 
Lucas shared her personal 
involvement in the carceral 
system, discussing how her 

father 
was 
incarcerated 
during her childhood and 
how engaging with loved 
ones through the carceral 
system can put a strain on 
families. 
Lucas 
asked 
Roberts 
about her own experiences 
in this realm, and Roberts 
admitted not taking very 
good care of herself during 
the years in which she 
focused only on Senghor. 
Within 
this 
dynamic, 

Roberts 
said 
she 
often 
found 
herself 
spending 
all of her time on Sengor’s 
work, which led to a decline 
in her own wellbeing.
“Any relationship, and 
that 
relationship, 
with 
power 
dynamics, 
aren’t 
bound 
because 
he 
was 
solely dependent on me for a 
lot of things,” Roberts said. 
“I took that responsibility 
seriously, and I spent a lot 
of days not taking care of 
myself as well as I needed 
to, but it was because I felt 
like he needed me, needed 
the support to do the things 

that he wants to do. And 
there were times when I 
was so depressed that I 
didn’t leave the house… I 
just kind of built a little 
cocoon around myself.” 
Roberts said she knows 
that he is her soulmate, 
though the two are no 
longer 
in 
a 
romantic 
relationship. 
“I do believe that we are 
soulmates, and soulmates 
come into our lives to shake 
things up, right?” Roberts 
said. “You think of the 
soulmate story as the fairy 
tale, and you’re going to 
ride off into the sunset, 
and you’re going to have 
all this bliss, but in fact, it’s 
the opposite, because your 
soulmate is usually your 
mirror, and in many ways, 
Shaka was my mirror, and 
a lot of his trauma mirrored 
my trauma but in different 
ways.”
Engineering 
junior 
Shimonti Sengupta, event 
coordinator of the Prison 
Birth Project, attended the 
talk. She said she really 
enjoyed hearing about what 
it was like having a loved 
one 
return 
home, 
from 
Roberts’ perspective.
“Listening to her talk 
about what it was like for 
her to prepare, and for 
families to prepare, for 
incarcerated individuals to 
come back, I think is really 
interesting,” Sengupta said.
Roberts said she works 
to combat the stereotype 
of 
being 
the 
“insecure 
woman” that is the perfect 
candidate to fall in love 
with 
a 
person 
who 
is 
incarcerated. Lucas asked 
her to share how she did 
so, and Roberts responded 
that she hopes that readers 
enter the book with an open 
mind.
“There are some people 
who feel like, ‘She had all 
these insecurities, and he 
fed her all these beautiful 
words, and she fell for it, 
hook, line and sinker,’” 
Roberts said. “People are 
going to walk away from 
the book with different 
opinions. 
Sometimes 
people 
walk 
into 
any 
situation already with their 
mind made, so they read 
it, and it only confirms 
what they already believe. 
But then sometimes you 
can read something with 
an open mind, and it can 
actually change your mind 
and makes you think about 
things differently.”

Meeting at Ann Arbor District Library seeks to make urban hubs more accessible

DownTown Hall examines issues 
facing pedestrians across city

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Jessica A.S. Letaw, a board 
member of the Downtown 
Development 
Authority, 
hosted a “DownTown Hall” at 
the Ann Arbor District Library 
Wednesday night. Letaw said 
she took it upon herself to host 
DownTown 
Hall 
meetings 
to try to make the DDA’s 
technical work in downtown 
Ann Arbor more accessible to 
the general public.
Letaw hosts this event twice a 
month to provide an opportunity 
for city residents to have a 
conversation 
about 
current 
events and changes going on in 
downtown Ann Arbor. 
“A 
healthy 
downtown 
informs a healthy city,” Letaw 
said. “I wanted to make sure 
that anybody who wanted to 
have access to be able to ask 
questions of somebody who is 
doing this work.”
The Ann Arbor DDA, created 
in 1982, strives to “undertake 
public 
improvements 
that 
have the greatest impact in 
strengthening the downtown 
area and attracting new private 
investments.” Letaw kept to 
this theme during the meeting 
by covering the DDA’s 2018 
State of the Downtown report, 
which covered statistics about 
different aspects of downtown 
Ann Arbor such as people-

friendly streets, employment, 
investment and growth.
“A lot of times, when we think 
about downtown, especially as 
a parking authority, we think 
of it as a place for cars,” Letaw 
said. “But in reality, a city is a 
place for people.”
Letaw explained the division 
between responsibilities that 
the city of Ann Arbor and the 
DDA share. While the city of 
Ann Arbor is in charge of road 
right-of-way, such as street 
maintenance 
and 
signals, 
the DDA is responsible for 
pedestrian right-of-way, Letaw 
said. 
In 
maintaining 
this, 
the DDA uses tax-increment 
financing (TIF) to create a 
right-of-way for people that 
is welcoming and easy to use. 
Currently, the DDA is working 
on improving safety in the city 
for bicyclists.
“Nobody is going to take 
their kid on Plymouth (Road),” 
Letaw said. “Nobody is going to 
take their kid on Washtenaw. 
Nobody is going to take their 
kid on Jackson, they’d be 
insane if they did. But what if 
they weren’t?” 
One of the DDA’s most 
recent 
developments 
was 
implementing 
the 
first 
protected two-way bike lane 
installed on William Street. 
Their decision to place it here 
was based on an accident 
review of all collisions and 
conflicts in downtown over the 

last five years, which labeled 
this street as an area of high 
vulnerability.
City Councilmember Kathy 
Griswold, D-Ward 2, who has 
been a longtime advocate of 
pedestrian safety, was also in 
attendance. She stated Ann 
Arbor could begin improving 
pedestrian safety with three 
distinct steps. 
“We need to hire a senior 
engineer with ‘Vision Zero’ 
expertise. Vision Zero is a 
proven process for reducing 
roadway fatalities and serious 
injuries,” 
Griswold 
said. 
Number two, would be the need 
to cap all of our crosswalks 
lit 
with 
positive, 
contrast 
lighting. We’re working on 
that. That’s quite expensive, 
but we’re not there yet. And 
number three, we need a state 
crosswalk law so that everyone 
knows what that law is.”
Ann Arbor resident Rich 
Chang, 
who 
attended 
the 
meeting, 
is 
the 
CEO 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
tech 
company 
NewFoundry. Chang is also 
a part of seven committees 
around town, including the 
board of directors for United 
Way of Washtenaw County 
and the chair of the executive 
committee for the Ann Arbor/
Ypsilanti Regional Chamber. 
As 
someone 
involved 
in 
multiple committees around 
town, Chang said he hopes 
more residents will take the 

initiative to become informed 
about their city.
“I feel like more and more 
people are not willing to take 
the time to become more 
informed and ask questions,” 
Chang said. “Critical thinking, 
to me, is one of the biggest 
challenges. I think if we all 
did better at critical thinking 
and having dialogue … I think 
people will not have as much of 
a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction.” 
Letaw 
also 
spoke 
about 
her hopes for DDA’s future 
expansion, including taking 
on solid waste management 
problems and implementing 
art projects similar to those 
in downtown Detroit. One 
example she spoke of was The 
Belt, an art alley unveiled in 
Detroit in 2014. She also talked 
about the DDA’s goals for their 
charter renewal in 2033. At 
that time, they hope to become 
leaders in making downtown 
Ann Arbor more equitably 
accessible and available for 
people using all modes of 
transportation.
“It’s hard to know when it 
comes to politics, or even any 
kind of public work. It’s hard 
to know if your work makes a 
difference,” Letaw said. “But 
when work that you do builds 
up to a protected bike lane or 
more bike parking or whatever 
it is, it feels really gratifying.”
Julia Fanzeres contributed

North Koreans need our attention

T

he Democratic People’s 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
receives news coverage 
quite often due to infamous 
dictator Kim Jong Un and his 
run-ins with the United States 
in regard to nuclear weaponry. 
While 
this 
creates 
certain 
awareness of the country and 
sheds light on a notorious leader, 
much of the reporting on North 
Korea falls short and glosses over 
the actual experiences of the 
approximately 25 million citizens 
living in the northern part of the 
Korean Peninsula. Within that 25 
million may also exist the family 
my grandmother was separated 
from when the two Koreas split. 
The history between North 
and South Korea and its division 
at the 38th parallel is a recent 
product of the intervention of 
the Soviet Union and the United 
States during the Cold War. What 
most people don’t realize is that 
when the Korean War ended in 
1953, there were many families 
separated by the division, and 
it is unknown today how many 
relatives have been lost to either 
side of the heavily militarized 
borders. There have been some 
reunions for families, but North 
Korea commonly uses these 
reconciliations 
as 
bargaining 
tactics, and due to limitations, 
most South Koreans who have 
been separated pass away before 
they can reunite with lost family 
members. 
Due to news coverage, North 
Korea has become a constant 
talking piece of a poisonous, 
authoritarian regime. The Kim 
family is known internationally 
for their nuclear weapon threats 
and has become a joke for the 
absurdity of how much power 
they believe they hold. However, 
many news outlets overlook the 
North Korean defectors and 
people stuck under the hold of this 
authoritarian regime. Because 
of politics, the stories of Koreans 
have been underrepresented, and 
North Korean refugees have been 
grossly overlooked.
Because of North Korea’s strict 
regime and distrust of other 
countries, the information about 

what goes on inside the country 
is limited. But nonprofits such 
as Liberty in North Korea have 
helped us understand that North 
Koreans have many restrictions 
imposed by the government that 
include no freedom of movement, 
speech, information or religion. 
Furthermore, 
there 
are 
horrifying violations of human 
rights in North Korea like chronic 
food shortages, since most of the 
food grown in the country goes 
toward the military. 
North Koreans also suffer 
from political prison camps, 
public executions and collective 
punishment. According to the U.S. 
Department of State, between 
80,000 
and 
120,000 
North 
Koreans are in prison and brutal 
physical labor camps. Prisoners 
face 
torture 
and 
beatings, 
and 
women 
are 
especially 
predisposed to trafficking and 
coercion. Punishments are also 
intergenerational, as the 1972 
law of “three generations of 
punishment” states that if one 
person is convicted of a crime, 
their immediate family may also 
be convicted, along with their 
next two generations. 
The North Korean defectors 
who choose to escape have an 
arduous journey ahead, as they 
aren’t able to simply cross over 
the border to South Korea due 
to its heavy militarization. They 
often have to escape through 
China, where the government has 
an agreement with North Korea 
to bring back any defectors they 
discover. People who return to 
North Korea after escaping are 
at risk of forced labor, forced 
abortions 
and 
interrogation. 
There are currently programs and 
activists who help North Koreans 
at checkpoints — that have even 
built an underground railroad to 
bring them to freedom. 
In the first week of November, 
the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of Liberty in North Korea 
held an event where two North 
Korean 
defectors, 
Jeongyol 
Ri and Ilhyeok Kim, came to 
share their stories and spread 
awareness about North Korean 
people. They both want to use 

their 
first-hand 
experiences 
to educate the world about the 
people behind the authoritarian 
regime and how to properly 
rectify the country. 
“For 
the 
South 
Korean 
government, they have been 
talking about the ‘peace’ for the 
longest time, but nothing has 
been solved,” Kim told me in 
Korean. “Likewise, for the United 
States, they always talk about 
denuclearization, but there have 
been no improvements in the 
human rights violations that have 
occurred. Thus, I feel it is more 
efficient to focus on the North 
Korean people.” 
The 
United 
States 
often 
focuses on the politics with North 
Korea and denuclearization talks, 
but we need to listen to the stories 
of defectors who are able to give 
us knowledge about the lives of 
North Koreans. 
 “As always, the North Korean 
regime lies. The regime is really 
scared of showing the reality of 
North Korea. To show the world 
the reality, it’s important North 
Koreans share their stories,” Ri 
said to me in Korean. 
While 
the 
efforts 
in 
denuclearizing and attempting to 
negotiate with Kim Jong Un are 
important, the results have been 
stagnant. The main issue is that 
we are politicizing a country over 
the welfare of millions of people, 
who are suffering due to a lack of 
liberty. We take certain freedoms 
for granted, especially in the 
United States, and by turning 
our focus to people over politics, 
the results could be the proper 
form of peace we are constantly 
striving for with North Korea. 
With the resources and finite 
amount of information we have 
on the country, we need to utilize 
the scarce knowledge efficiently 
and for the correct purpose.

to Liberty in North Korea, a 
non-profit with proceeds that go 
toward liberating North Korean 
defectors,

As one of the most powerful 
brands of our generation, Nike is 
more than just a sports apparel 
company: Its catchy “Just Do It” 
slogan has inspired generations of 
athletes to train with confidence 
and 
determination. 
Nike’s 
advertisements also depend on 
influencers 
and 
athletes 
who 
tout motivational messages that 
promote 
athletic 
excellence 
and social change. For example, 
professional 
tennis 
player 
Serena 
Williams’s 
“Dream 
Crazier” advertisement delivers a 
compelling narrative for women’s 
empowerment 
and 
showcases 
her 
“unconstrained 
grit 
and 
determination.”
When Williams announced her 
pregnancy, Nike benefitted from 
this unending grit through a series 
of ad campaigns that promoted her 
as a symbol of said grit and physical 
health. The story fits perfectly with 
Nike’s identity as a progressive and 
woman-empowering company. At 
the exact same time, however, the 
company continued to abandon 
support of other less well-known 
athletes also preparing to have a 
baby. Kara Goucher, an Olympian 
referenced in The New York Times 
op-ed, suffered from chronic hip 
injuries after running the Boston 
Marathon just seven months after 
having her son. Goucher also told 
The New York Times she suffered 
severe emotional trauma after 
trying to balance the needs of her 
severely-ill newborn with the 
need to continue running so she 
could earn money. These stressors 
— both physical and emotional 
— were born from Nike’s threat 
to revoke her financial security 
should she stop training. This 
covert 
exploitation 
contradicts 
Nike’s public narrative, revealing 
that campaigns such as Williams’s 

solely exist to boost sales rather 
than to truly support women. 
This is disgustingly ironic and 
represents a greater structural 
problem for maternal care in the 
sports apparel industry, which 
sidelines women to use them only 
as branding tools. 
Cutting pay for women in any 
profession because of pregnancy 
is a restrictive violation of bodily 
autonomy. In fact, the freedom 
“to found a family” is 16th on the 
United 
Nations’s 
Declaration 
of Human Rights, and Nike’s 
contracts are a clear strike against 
this right.
Aside from Nike’s exploitative 
marketing practices, the abuse 
of female athletes appears to be 
rooted in an extreme imbalance 
among the bureaucracies and staffs 
that are meant to support female 
athletes. This is fairly apparent in 
the company’s decision-making 
hierarchy: The four executives 
who negotiate contracts for track 
and field athletes — including paid 
leave for pregnant female athletes 
— are all men. This system 
means that no one with first-
hand experience of pregnancy or 
postpartum has the opportunity 
to fight for these women’s rights 
when it comes to Nike’s contract 
negotiation. 
In particular, runner Mary 
Cain’s powerful op-ed in The 
New York Times has cast light on 
the darker side of Nike’s Oregon 
Project. 
Cain 
described 
how 
her former coach Albert Salazar 
pushed her into a system of 
restrictive eating and unhealthy 
training, resulting in her missing 
her period for three years and 
serious injuries, such as broken 
bones. Both Goucher and former 
Oregon 
Project 
coach 
Steve 
Magness have corroborated Cain’s 

claim that Salazar also publicly 
berated female athletes for their 
weight for years. When Cain told 
her coaches she had begun to cut 
herself after being told her five-
pound weight gain worsened 
her athletic performance, they 
offered no help or support. Former 
Nike female athletes have also 
claimed their coaches did not 
include a nutritionist or a licensed 
sports psychologist to support 
the athletes’ demanding physical 
regimen. Given this evidence, we 
should be hesitant to accept Nike’s 
reversal of its policy on pregnant 
athletes as a resolution to the 
entire issue. Nike’s continual 
maltreatment of female athletes 
still facilitates emotional and 
physical abuse at the hands of a 
predominantly 
male 
coaching 
staff who have no ability to 
empathize with their trainees.
In an emailed response to The 
Times, Salazar said he “denied 
many of Mary’s claims and said 
he had supported her health and 
welfare.” This contradiction feels 
unrealistic given the plethora of 
female athletes and other coaches 
who have both corroborated 
Cain’s stories and included their 
own tales of maltreatment and 
abuse. 
Nike’s hypocritical exploitation 
of 
its 
female 
athletes 
is 
emblematic of the misogynistic 
culture surrounding women in 
sports. Despite coming under fire 
for its controversial practices, 
Nike has not yet come up with 
a better treatment for its female 
athletes. However, rather than 
investigating and compensating 
directly involved athletes, Nike 
should center its solution around 
the 
abhorrent 
culture 
that 
produced such unethical practices 
and abusive coaches like Salazar.

FROM THE DAILY

On Nike’s hypocritical misogyny
E

arlier this year, six-time USA outdoor running champion Alysia 
Montaño spoke out against Nike’s penalization of pregnant female 
athletes. The story launched what continues to be an ongoing 
discussion on Nike and its maltreatment of women athletes by reducing or 
even ceasing their pay during pregnancy and postpartum recovery. In early 
November, World Junior Champion Mary Cain appeared in a New York 
Times op-ed where she accused Nike’s Oregon Project and her former coach, 
Alberto Salazar, of carrying out physically and emotionally abusive training 
regimens, leading her to develop osteoporosis and intentions to self-harm.

Psi U, respect survivors of sexual assault
I

n 
anticipation 
of 
the 
Michigan-Michigan 
State 
football game this past 
Saturday, the Phi chapter of 
the Psi Upsilon fraternity at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
hung a bed sheet from its 
house’s window bearing the 
phrase “You can’t touch us @
LarryNassar”, a reference to the 
former MSU physician currently 
serving multiple sentences in 
prison for first-degree sexual 
misconduct and possession of 
child pornography. Photos of the 
bed sheet quickly made rounds 
on 
social 
media, 
rightfully 
attracting 
negative 
attention 
from 
U-M 
and 
Michigan 
State students alike. This was 
seconded 
by 
those 
publicly 
affiliated with the Nassar case, 
including gymnast Simone Biles. 
As the Editorial Page Editors 
and Senior Editors of The 
Michigan Daily Opinion section, 
we condemn Psi U’s behavior on 
Saturday and urge the fraternity 
to publicly acknowledge this and 
apologize for its actions.

Larry Nassar was convicted 
of molesting at least 265 young 
women and girls, mostly athletes, 
from multiple schools and teams. 
There is no overstating the 
trauma that he caused. Poking fun 
at this situation and portraying 
the tragedy as MSU-specific 
shows a lack of compassion for 
survivors of sexual assault and 
a lack of understanding for the 
long-lasting 
and 
far-reaching 
consequences of Nassar’s crimes. 
The website for U-M’s chapter of 
Psi Upsilon states the fraternity 
“nurtures 
development 
of 
mature 
decision-making, 
individual 
responsibility 
and 
moral 
leadership,” 
and 
that 
its members are “guided by 
principles 
of 
responsibility, 
civility and courtesy.” Using 
sexual assault as a punchline is 
not a civil or mature decision. If 
Psi U really wants to champion 
itself as a pillar of maturity, 
responsibility 
and 
moral 
leadership, then it must publicly 
acknowledge its actions and 
work to rectify its faults.

Fraternity and Sorority Life 
staff have already contacted 
the fraternity and say that Psi U 
has plans to internally address 
the behavior, which is a step in 
the right direction. We also want 
to acknowledge the community 
members who took the time 
to file complaints against the 
fraternity for speaking up about 
the insensitive banner. However, 
there has been no public word 
from the chapter, including 
anything on their Facebook or 
website, that even mentions the 
Saturday controversy. Pursuing 
corrective action against those 
responsible is a start, but the 
rest of the University needs to 
know that jokes about sexual 
assault are not acceptable in our 
community, even when directed 
at our sports rivals.

The eerie fate of Voyager 2
I

n 
November 
2018, 
NASA’s Voyager 2 space 
probe became the second 
object launched from Earth to 
exit the outer boundary of the 
solar system — about 11 billion 
miles away — and enter the 
realm of interstellar space. 
Its twin craft, Voyager 1, was 
the first, crossing the barrier 
in 2012. Since their launches 
in 1977, the spacecrafts have 
taken beautiful fly-by images 
of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus 
and Neptune, along with their 
moons. New papers published 
in Nature Astronomy look 
into the differing properties 
of the environments inside 
and outside of our solar 
system. The findings confirm 
that our solar system has a 
clearly defined boundary — 
the heliopause. Beyond the 
heliopause there is a sharp 
drop in solar wind particles, 
and 
high-energy 
galactic 
cosmic rays, which originate 
from 
galactic 
systems 
in 
interstellar space, dominate.
Both Voyager crafts will 
eventually exhaust the power 
necessary for them to collect 
data and transmit it back 
to Earth, likely in the next 
decade. However, they will 
continue traveling through 
the cosmos, fueled by inertia. 
They 
will 
speed 
through 
space that we currently only 
know about through data from 
instrumentation 
on 
Earth, 
inhabiting the heavens that 
have stirred our imaginations 
for as long as we’ve looked up 
at the night sky. The Voyager 
probes are equally amazing 
and 
unsettling, 
expanding 
our understanding of outer 
space 
while 
presenting 
a 
unique perspective on life, 
death and fate. 
NASA 
initiated 
The 
Voyager 
Program 
project 
during the Space Race frenzy, 
an outgrowth of the Cold 
War that led to tremendous 
technological advances and 
an increased curiosity in the 
universe beyond our Earth. 
The Voyager probes are the 

perfect examples of humans’ 
insatiable quest for increased 
knowledge. With every new 
bit of daily information on 
the 
interstellar 
magnetic 
field, the boundaries of our 
human knowledge are pushed 
outward. The insights gleaned 
from the Voyager Program 
may not be closely relevant to 
the health and social issues 
that immediately affect our 
daily lives, but it is amazing 
to see humans using what 
we already know to create 
new ways to learn even more 
about this universe.

But there will be a time 
when Voyager 1 and Voyager 
2 no longer contribute to the 
expansion of our knowledge. 
Voyager 1 is already using 
backup thrusters to keep its 
antennae 
pointed 
toward 
Earth, and NASA predicts 
its instrumentation, and that 
of Voyager 2, will lose all 
instrument function by about 
2025. After that, they will face 
the same fate as the Pioneer 
probes. Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 
11 were launched in the early 
1970s 
and 
were 
the 
first 
spacecraft to encounter Jupiter 
and 
Saturn, 
respectively; 
they 
no 
longer 
have 
any 
communication with Earth. 
Pioneer 11 has already escaped 
the solar system, and Pioneer 
10 is predicted to follow suit.
I view the moment a probe 
stops 
functioning 
as 
the 
moment of “death” of the 
probe. What was once a silent 
explorer cutting through vast 

space will succumb to its 
entropy and serve no further 
purpose. Unlike the terrestrial 
death of a biological being or a 
technological work, however, 
there is no rest for the probes 
that die. NASA believes that 
Voyager 2 may continue to zip 
through the cosmos eternally, 
traveling billions upon billions 
of miles for as long as the 
existence of time itself.
The 
universe 
naturally 
creates countless objects that 
will forever remain flying 
through space. These objects 
were never given life to begin 
with and therefore will never 
die. Others, such as stars, 
eventually 
undergo 
end-of-
life processes that see them 
quietly fade away or become 
something 
different 
from 
what they originally were. The 
Voyager probes, in contrast, 
were created by humans from 
materials 
provided 
by 
the 
universe. 
They 
were 
built 
with missions and survived to 
fulfill them, but their deaths 
lack 
closure 
because 
they 
will continue to wander the 
darkness indefinitely, existing 
without 
purpose. 
What 
is 
defeating about the impending 
deaths 
of 
Voyager 
1 
and 
Voyager 2 is that we will know 
of their death the moment 
it occurs, but we will not be 
able to examine what failed 
mechanically, and we will not 
be able to celebrate and retire 
them.
This column is not a knock 
on the Voyager Program or to 
the aspirations of those who 
wish to explore the unknown. 
It is rather a musing on the 
fates of objects, including the 
Voyager 2 space probe, that 
may join some of the first 
human-made 
creations 
to 
have no limits on how far and 
how long they travel. When 
Voyager 2 completely ceases 
to function, it will indeed 
become nothing but a voyager 
– traveling, and nothing else.

Avant-garde 
British 
singer 
FKA 
Twigs returned with her first project in 
four years on Friday, Nov. 8. The highly-
anticipated Magdalene is a glimpse into 
the distorted interiority of FKA Twigs, 
a masterful depiction of the connection 
between pain and beauty.
The release of Magdalene comes a few 
years on the heels of a well-publicized 
breakup 
with 
former 
vampire 
Robert 
Pattinson 
and 
about 
a year after 
FKA 
Twigs 
revealed that 
she 
suffers 
from 
fibroid 
tumors. In fact, 
the struggle of 
dealing 
with 
the 
pain 
of 
heartbreak 
and 
physical 
afflictions 
while 
under 
the public gaze is discussed in a few 
places across the album (most notably 
“thousand eyes” and “cellophane”). The 
emotions on display are so intimate and 
imbued with jagged resonance that at 
times it feels wrong, almost intrusive, 
to be listening to the album, as though 
you’re reading pages out of someone’s 
post-breakup diary.
The album’s title refers to Mary 
Magdalene, 
a 
devoted 
follower 
of 
Jesus who has 
developed 
a 
widespread, 
inaccurate 
reputation 
as 
a 
repentant 
prostitute 
due 
to 
centuries 
of 
ecclesiastical 
confusion. 
She 
is 
representative of both the vitriol with 
which the sexuality of women is treated 
by Western institutions as well as how 
information and communication can 
be corrupted through compounding 
misunderstandings. 
Both 
of 
these 
connotations play a role on Magdalene. 
FKA Twigs certainly does not shy away 
from sexual themes (e.g. her references 
to masturbation on “daybed”), and many 
of the songs about romantic relationships 

revolve around her struggles with 
reciprocity 
and 
misunderstandings: 
a similar gradual decay of truth that 
led to Mary Magdalene’s promiscuous 
reputation leads to disintegration and 
heartache for FKA Twigs: “I didn’t know 
you were lonely / If you’d have just told 
me, I’d be home with you.”
In spite of the overall strength of the 
project, certain tracks manage to stand 
out even in comparison to the rest of the 
album: “fallen alien” is a stunning, acerbic 
reflection upon a failing relationship 
featuring 
some of the 
most creative 
production 
on 
the 
project, 
and 
“cellophane” 
is an aching 
ballad draped 
in detuned, icy 
piano. 
The 
production 
is handled by 
an 
eclectic 
collection 
of 
eminent 
artists, 
including the 
likes of Skrillex, Oneohtrix Point Never 
and Jack Antonoff (as well as FKA Twigs 
herself). Perhaps the guest producer with 
the most evident influence on the overall 
sound of the record is Nicolas Jaar, whose 
creative sound design and use of empty 
space is fundamental to the cold, glitchy 
emotional resonance of the project. 
In my experience as a music critic, I 
have found it much easier to discuss bad 
albums 
than 
good albums. 
This 
is 
not 
because I enjoy 
being cruel or 
derisive (quite 
the 
opposite) 
but 
because 
I 
am 
lazy. 
Bad 
albums 
tend 
to 
be 
bad in similar and identifiable ways, 
whereas good albums tend to be, by their 
nature, idiosyncratic and very difficult 
to describe or dissect in a way that feels 
sufficient. The emotions conveyed by 
an excellent project such as Magdalene 
are impossible to convert back to mere 
language. The album’s exploration of 
internal disjunction and its relation 
to anxiety, fatigue and love is deeply 
impressive, and I hope you enjoy it as 
much as I do.

FKA’s masterpiece

ALBUM REVIEW

JONAH MENDELSON
Daily Arts Writer

Reading Sharon Olds’s “Arias” is quite the adventure, albeit 
an adventure for which Olds does not provide a map. “Arias” 
refers to the alphabetized collection of poems depicting 
anything from emotionally-draining memories of hardships 
Olds has incurred 
in her 76 years to 
obscure tangents 
that seem to be 
the product of a 
wandering brain 
late 
at 
night. 
Olds’s balance of 
vivid description 
alongside 
eye-
catching 
but 
not 
pretentious 
literary 
experimentation 
helps the majority 
of 
her 
poems 
shine in their own 
right.
Unfortunately, 
Olds’s 
presentation of her poems often falls flat. As a result of the 
poems that pack in around them, the more exceptional poems 
often don’t reach their potential. Since these poems, or arias, 
are alphabetized, they have a thematic consistency emulating 
the composition of a thoroughly shuffled deck of cards. Olds is 
no novice author; this was a deliberate decision with calculated 
effects. The reader wears a hyperactive mood ring as they 
progress from one poem to the next, often amplifying the 
emotional impact of each poem as it varies so heavily from the 
last. When this technique works, it exemplifies the evocative 
power of literature. Olds eloquently executes this transition in 
the few pages between “Mortal Aria” and “Object Permanence 
Aria.” One moment, Olds is depicting the heart wrenching 
final stages of her late partner’s battle with cancer, the 
simultaneous planning for his death and longing for his youth 
that she experienced in the days leading up to his passing. 
Olds’s recollection of her partner’s youth prepares the reader 
for the more innocent portrayal of Olds herself as a young child 
in the subsequent aria, where Olds describes the moment in 
which she understands that her mother still exists when she 
exits the room — that her mother’s being doesn’t orbit her own. 
A chronological organization of these poems would not have 
granted “Object Permanence Aria” the same magnitude of 
innocence, as the poem’s tone may have been diluted by that of 
similar recollections of early childhood. 
But this desired effect does not always materialize. In fact, 

getting through certain portions of the 
collection can be outright frustrating. 
In one poem, Olds reflects on her 
relationship with her father and considers 
the various forms in which love may 
manifest itself. Then, without warning, 
Olds depicts an eerily realistic scene 
— one of a toilet flushing after a bowel 
movement. 
Although 
she relates this scene 
to 
the 
upbringing 
of her children and 
perhaps uses it as a 
metaphor for a turn for 
the worse in her later 
years, 
its 
inclusion 
and lingering takes the 
sting out of the more 
emotion-ridden poem 
preceding it. This is 
a 
recurring 
theme 
among the arias. At 
times, 
Olds 
wholly 
exits the territory of 
vividness and enters 
that of the jarringly 
explicit. While a reader aspires to hear the 
unadulterated version of a poet’s mind and 
vision, few aspire to read “the gathers and folds of the asshole” 
in the same sentence as “like a child at a petting zoo.” Moments 
like these reflect the hiccups in consistency that hold Olds back 
from an immaculate work. Olds’s attempts to push the limits 
of poetic norms 
are 
valiant; 
innovation 
would 
never 
happen 
without 
experimentation. 
But Olds’s edgier 
instances 
of 
experimentation 
simply 
do 
not 
work. 
While 
tangents 
and 
comic relief can 
be 
refreshing, 
at 
times 
their 
inclusion 
seems 
poorly 
deliberated, 
serving to derail 
a previously well-worked narrative instead of contributing to 
it. 
By removing overt, inter-poem relatability, Olds actually 

supplies an additional layer of realism — her structure begins to 
reflect the curious organization of the human psyche. Everyone 
has obscure memories that, no matter how aged or insignificant, 
do not fade. The human brain is not a pristine filing cabinet of 
memories organized by date or theme. There is rarely a rhyme 
or reason to reminisce. One could only imagine this effect 
amplifying 
as 
one’s 
inventory 
of 
memories 
expands over 
nearly 
eight 
decades. 
Olds’s 
spontaneous 
and 
thematically 
inconsistent 
recollection 
of 
events 
sacrifices 
an 
even 
flow 
between 
poems 
to 
obtain 
an 
authentic and unfiltered glimpse into her mind. But without 
access to Olds’s mind, “Arias” requires multiple readings to 
offer more than just this glimpse.

Since I began writing this column, I have mainly used 
it to express my views on things that I love or facets of 
the entertainment industry that have left me grumbling 
for one reason or another. Many of those articles have 
mentioned “Star Wars” in some capacity. I like “Star Wars” 
a lot. I always have. Over the past year or so I have tried 
hard to branch into different parts of the entertainment 
industry, writing about Spotify, podcasts and the Chinese 
marketplace just to name a few. It’s been a long time since 
I went back to the old “Star Wars” well. But in a few short 
weeks “The Rise of Skywalker” will be released in theaters, 
ostensibly a final conclusion to the story that began a long 
time ago in a decade far far away, and I would be remiss 
if I didn’t get my two cents in before all is said and done.
I’ve argued time and time again in these pages that the 
ending of a story is what defines its meaning. The curious 
thing about “Star Wars” is that it has already ended. 
Twice. In 1983, “Return of the Jedi” brought the original 
trilogy to a conclusion that left audiences thinking “Star 
Wars” was about the redemptive power of love and the 
relationship between a father and a son. In 2005, “Revenge 
of the Sith” brought the prequels to a close and in doing so 
redefined the then six-part saga as the tragedy of Anakin 
Skywalker. Now “The Rise of Skywalker” will seek to put 
its own stamp on the story George Lucas told and, in turn, 
must justify the Disney trilogy’s entire existence.
It feels like a lifetime ago that Disney first bought 
Lucas film and announced that there was to be more 
“Star Wars” and yet, 
as it so often goes, it 
also seems as if the 
years 
in 
between 
have gone by much 
too 
quickly. 
When 
“The Force Awakens” 
was released, I was a 
senior in high school. 
I actually got into 
Michigan the same 
day the film came out. 
Driving back from 
the movie theater, I 
pulled into the park 
by 
Barton 
Pond, 
loaded 
Wolverine 
Access on my friends 
phone and heard the 
news. My time at 
Michigan will forever 
be linked with the 
time 
these 
movies 
came out. Now the last movie in the trilogy is coming, 
and as the future of “Star Wars” once again becomes 
uncertain, so too has my own. Unlike senior year of high 
school, I don’t know exactly where I’m going to be next 
year. I don’t know what kind of job I will have or who I will 
be living with. But I know I’m glad that I took the journey. 
Glad that I’ve had the experiences I’ve had at Michigan, 
that I got to see what it was like for your team to go to 
the Final Four while you were in school and what it was 
like to anticipate a “Star Wars” movie. The anticipation of 

these movies cannot be discounted; If nothing else, I have 
deeply enjoyed the experience of wondering what was to 
come. The number of conversations I had after “The Force 
Awakens” about Rey’s parentage and what Luke was up 
to were among the best times I can remember as a fan of 
“Star Wars.”
So what do I expect to see out of the final movie? I expect 
it to be exciting, fun, maybe a little bit sad. After “The Last 
Jedi” I’ve learned to let go of what I want these films to be, 
and just take them or leave them for what they are. That’s 
not to say that I’ve come around to thinking that “The Last 
Jedi” is a good “Star Wars” movie (some things can never 
be redeemed), but it means that I will not enter this new 
movie with the expectation that anything in particular 
happen at all. That’s not what I’m here for anymore. For 
me at least, it’s no longer just about the movie itself. It’s the 
lead up to it, the weekly re-watching of all the movies in my 
student house, the intense discussion right after we leave 
the theater, the thrill of seeing a movie with a huge crowd 
on opening night, that communal viewing experience we 
so rarely get in this age of Netflix and Disney+. It’s not 
just about going to see the movie, it’s about the people you 
see it with. The best stories were meant to be shared with 
others. No matter what I think of the Disney “Star Wars” 
movies, I will be forever grateful for the opportunity they 
gave me and so many people I love to have a meaningful 
theater experience together. I have cherished each and 
every opening night. And so as we approach this final 
chapter of the Skywalker Saga I think not just about how 
this chapter of my favorite film series will come to a close, 
but how this chapter of my own life will soon come to a 
close as well.
So 
many 
people 
have asked me what 
I’m 
planning 
to 
do next year. It’s a 
good question; after 
all, 
I 
have 
many 
friends from the film 
department 
who 
graduated last year 
who still don’t know 
what to do. But that 
question 
does 
not 
interest me. Not right 
this 
moment. 
Not 
when Michigan still 
has a final shot at 
Ohio State. Not when 
I have two papers due 
in the next two days. 
Not when I can still 
get that experience 
of seeing new yellow 
text roll across the 
screen to booming John Williams music for the first time. 
Not when there are still old classmates to reconnect with, 
parties to hold, study spaces to uncover, stories to tell, 
adventures yet to be had. Not when I only have six more 
months of living in a home with six of my best friends. The 
question that interests me is not “what are you going to do 
next year,” but rather, “what are you doing right now?” To 
that I simply answer the same way C3PO did in the final 
trailer for the final “Star Wars.” I’m taking one last look 
at my friends.

Last Tuesday I found myself laying in bed 
when I should have been making myself a 
proper dinner. My thumb had settled into the 
routine up-down motion that all Instagram 
users know too well. Images of dancers and 
clips of dances floated by as reflections in 
my glasses as I glazed over in a bored stupor. 
Each post seemed more cliché or downright 
stupid than the last, and I found myself 
teetering on the familiar consideration of 
quitting Instagram for good when my thumb 
hit one final video: a clip of a dance set to “All 
These Things That I’ve Done” by The Killers. 
The post came from dancer/choreographer 
Nicholas Palmquist and was captioned with 
a plug for his upcoming class at Steps on 
Broadway, a famous New York City dance 
studio. Though well filmed, the clip is more 
of a rehearsal than a performance — the 
dancers wear leggings and T-shirts and 
stand inside a studio lined with bags and 
water bottles. The purple light coming in 
from the windows tells me that it was filmed 
in the evening, most likely at the end of 
another average day for the lives of everyone 
involved. 
The dance, however, feels very much above 
average. Palmquist’s choreography uses the 
section of The Killers’s song that layers a fast 
drum beat underneath the slow repetition of 
the words “I got soul but I’m not a soldier.” 
For a choreographer, this poses a question: 
Which rhythm should I follow? Palmquist 
somehow melds both. Dancers bounce their 
shoulders quickly and then whip their upper 
bodies in slow motion. They move through 
intricate jumps only to stop and luxuriate 
through the air in relaxed power poses. It’s 
a brilliant mix of tension. 
Most of all, I’m captivated by one dancer, 
specifically the woman in the front. Though 
Palmquist tagged everyone in the clip, I 
don’t feel comfortable making assumptions 

about which handle is hers. Perhaps the 
mystery becomes part of my intrigue. From 
beginning to end, she dances with a joy that 
builds in both ferocity and subtlety. She 
starts by whipping her head to the front to 
make eye contact with the camera and then 
breaks into a sly smile as she dips her head 
backward. Her entire chest and neck open 
as her upper body releases. It’s a vulnerable 
position, but her command over the space 
makes it powerful at the same time. 
As the music and choreography build, so 
does this woman’s fierce combination of 
strength and grace. The steps increase in size 
and sinuosity, but her musicality does not 
waver. The entire time, she stares down the 
front of the room with a beautiful intensity 
that only makes me want to keep watching. 
By the end, all the dancers break into 
their own informal jumping as if all those 
structured steps have finally bubbled over 
into pure, intense bliss. The front dancer 
lifts her palms to the sky and tips her head 
back as if she’s a girl in a made-for-television 
romcom and she’s dancing in the rain. 
The first time that I found it, I watched 
the whole clip four times back-to-back. 
I saved it to my Instagram archive and 
watched it again the next day. The day after 
that I linked it in my story because I couldn’t 
get enough of it. This weekend, I watched it 
some more. Today, I started to think about 
the serendipitous events that allowed me to 
come across the video at all. 
I don’t remember any of the other content 
that floated by my eyes in the time I spent 
scrolling last Tuesday. I only remember a 
sense of gray frustration over how mundane 
everything online was, and the specificities 
of that time are gone forever.
Despite this, I am left with the innate sense 
that time must not be equal, as this one-
minute dance easily makes up for an hour 
lost somewhere else. Palmquist’s dancers’ 
fiercely joyful attack to musicality is enough 
to keep me on Instagram, wondering where 
my scrolling will take me next.

There is an inherent ebb and flow of life. 
When you are not being pushed or pulled, 
you are stagnant. Apathetically waiting 
as the world yawns by. It is within art that 
we can fulfill our craving for the thrill of 
life’s ebbs and flows. Whether they are 
joyful or sorrowful, there is no doubt that 
experiencing them is far more exciting than 
standing still. 
Irish company Teac Damsa’s “Swan Lake/
Loch na hEala” exemplifies an extreme push 
and pull in performance. Choreographer 
Michael 
Keegan-Dolan’s 
masterfully 
reimagines 
Tchaikovsky’s 
ballet 
— 
directly 
contrasting 
childlike 
elation 
with 
terrified 
isolation, 
his 
iteration 
of 
“Swan 
Lake” 
is a uniquely 
aesthetic dance 
and 
theatrical 
performance 
rich with Irish 
history 
and 
folklore. 
The 
only 
similarity 
between 
Keegan-Dolan’s and Tchaikovsky’s “Swan 
Lake” is the presence of the titular animal. 
In Keegan-Dolan’s iteration, a chronically 
depressed man walks to a lake with a shotgun 
that his mother bought him for his birthday. 
The man appears ready to commit suicide 
when he encounters and falls madly in love 
with a wild swan that is equally as broken as 
he is. 
The piece opens with the narrator of 
the story, naked except for a pair of white 
underwear, tied to a cement block. As the 
actor begins to bleat in an animalistic nature, 
it becomes clear that the man is not a man 
but a goat. The goat begrudgingly circles the 
cement block and, as the lights go down, is 
surrounded by three dancing men. He bleats 
in fear until, under the pressure of the men, 
he takes human form and begins to tell the 
saddening tale. The actor who plays the 
narrator also plays a corrupt politician, a 
priest and, at one point, a radio. 
The theme of humans embodying animals 
does not end in the overture. It is soon 
revealed that a priest has turned four dancing 
women into swans as a form of punishment, 
since they were vocal about his raping of one 
of them. When this was revealed, the overture 
made more sense to me. Perhaps this man 
turned himself into a goat as punishment for 
raping the swan woman. Perhaps all of these 

dancers are viciously fighting to be free from 
a hellish world they either brought upon 
themselves or had thrust upon them.
Throughout the performance, I discovered 
that witnessing humans embody animals on 
stage is oddly satisfying. At their core humans 
are animalistic, yet we must suppress these 
instincts in order to be functioning members 
of society. It is through physical movement 
that these instincts are best released, and 
Keegan-Dolan seemed to have a firm grasp 
of that concept. 
Because of the saddening nature of the 
piece, the performance could have remained 
one-note. However, Keegan-Dolan found 
childlike joy just as well as he encapsulated 
the evil in this story. In a moment of brilliant 
choreography 
at the end of 
the show, the 
dancers 
begin 
to 
toss 
light 
feathers around 
like snow. 
Their 
feet 
moving among 
the 
mass 
of 
feathers 
on 
the 
ground 
served for an 
aesthetically 
pleasing 
end. 
Each 
dancer 
simultaneously 
kicked 
up 
a 
puff of feathers 
with 
one 
swift 
motion, 
seeming to wake from the hellscape that 
they had lived in during the show. In the 
last fifteen minutes, they were granted the 
freedom to live in pure ecstasy.
Skillfully using the white feathers as a way 
to shed light onto the darkness, the audience 
themselves were brought into the enjoyment 
of the moment. The feathers were tossed onto 
the front row and audience and performers 
alike relaxed into a state of what can simply 
be described as joy. The joyful metaphor 
continued on even into the bows. As the 
audience applauded the performers for their 
work, the dancers took their time soaking it 
all in, coming out for not just a second round 
of bows but a third. 
I was completely elated in this last 15 
minutes, although I struggled to justify 
its connection to the rest of the piece. 
Eventually, I decided it was about finding 
joy in the terrible, yet this is widely open 
for 
interpretation. 
In 
fact, 
the 
entire 
performance could have been a different 
story for each viewer. What was a goat to 
me may have been just a man on a rope to 
another. I had trouble labeling this piece 
as either dance or theatre because, to me, it 
was both. The endless possibilities this work 
provides the audience make it special. It does 
not give its audience answers. Instead, it 
poses questions.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

ALIX CURNOW
Daily Arts Writer

Halloween has come and gone, and Thanksgiving 
is on the horizon. And with Thanksgiving comes 
the holiday movie season, specifically the Hallmark 
Christmas movie season. The thing about Hallmark 
movies is that they lean into the fact that they’re 
Hallmark movies 
— 
actors 
who 
kind-of-sort-of 
look like that one 
big A-list star and a 
plot that’s far from 
Oscar-worthy but 
still 
comforting. 
These aren’t bad 
things, they’re just 
what to expect 
from a Hallmark 
Christmas movie. 
In 
the 
end, 
it 
doesn’t really matter if they’re good because more 
often than not they’re only playing in the background 
of a fun holiday cookie baking party. And “Last 
Christmas,” Universal’s newest Christmas movie, is 
exactly that, but with none of the Hallmark Christmas 
charm.
Starring 
Emilia Clarke 
(“Me 
Before 
You”) as Kate 
and 
Henry 
Golding 
(“Crazy 
Rich 
Asians”) 
as 
Tom, 
“Last 
Christmas” 
follows 
the 
pair as Kate 
falls in love 
with the aloof 
and seemingly 
perfect 
Tom. 
A classic series 
of meet-cutes 
populates 
the 
first 
20 
minutes 
of 
the 
film, 
highlighting 
Kate’s whiny self-centered nature, while Golding 
continues to play the typical debonair, two-
dimensional 
hunk. 
Emma 
Thompson 
(“Love 
Actually”) stars as Kate’s mother and Michelle Yeoh 
(“Crazy Rich Asians”) as her boss. Tragically, though, 
the two mother figures in Kate’s life never interact 
until the final scene of the movie, where they’re simply 
in the same room. 
The movie had the potential to be similar to “Love 
Actually” with its large cast of stars and intertwining 
storylines. But instead, “Last Christmas” focuses on 
the budding relationship between Clarke and Golding. 
And though the two are cute, there is none of that 
tension that comes with falling in love during a two-
week period because of pressure from the constant 
attention of friends and family. The relationships that 
actually show potential for a movie are cast off to the 
side, like Kate’s parents. From the beginning, it seems 

as if they’re on the rocks and somehow, through some 
Christmas magic, they reconnect to sing a Yugoslavian 
folk song. The film treats Kate’s sister in a similar 
manner: It becomes clear that she has been hiding 
her sexuality from her parents for years, and, despite 
being an obvious way to connect with an audience, the 
relationship is pushed to the side to focus on the flimsy 
relationship between Tom and Kate. Even the random 
policewomen have a more interesting connection than 
the title couple. 
Some 
might 
argue that the two 
aren’t meant to 
have 
chemistry, 
that it’s all part of 
the story’s grand 
plan to help Kate 
find herself. But 
that doesn’t mean 
the two characters 
need to seem like 
complete strangers 
throughout 
the 
whole movie. Though they eventually pour their 
hearts out to each other, the emotional connection 
seems seemingly out of left field. There was little to no 
context for the friendship, let alone the relationship. 
At least with Hallmark movies, even if the actual 
situation seems 
unrealistic, 
the characters 
spend 
significant 
periods 
of 
time together 
fighting 
over 
the future of 
a 
small-town 
bookstore. 
A 
holiday 
film 
isn’t 
complete 
without 
a 
cynical 
title 
character 
finally 
realizing that 
whatever 
material gain 
they’re chasing 
isn’t worth it 
if they miss 
the joys of life. They’re imbued with the magic of the 
Christmas spirit and “Last Christmas” is no different. 
In the span of two hours, Kate transforms from a 
lackluster Christmas cynic into the giving, generous 
spirit we all have inside. She realizes that the trauma 
from her heart condition the year previous, a plot point 
that is hardly explored, isn’t worth torturing her boss 
or her family over. She becomes a picture-perfect 
daughter, friend and employee. 
Obviously, the holidays are a stressful time for 
everyone — family is visiting, hams are in the oven 
and I’m still in the process of convincing my parents 
to let me sit at the kids’ table to avoid small talk about 
my future. The only real constants during these 
supposedly cheery winter months are the endearing 
qualities of romantic Christmas movies, and if you 
don’t make the time to see “Last Christmas,” there’s 
always next year.

‘Last Christmas’ isn’t good

What to watch for: Michigan battles Indiana

All week, Michigan’s players 
and coaches have been asked 
whether Saturday’s trip to 7-3 
Indiana constitutes a trap game. 
And all week, the response has 
been resounding: The Hoosiers 
are too good for that.
The logic backs it up — 
Indiana nearly won at Penn 
State last weekend and ranks 
14th nationally in passing yards 
per game. On paper, it’s the 
Wolverines’ fourth or fifth-
toughest game of the season to 
date, depending on your opinion 
of Iowa.
And yet, there’s an irresistible 
inclination to look at what lies 
ahead, 
toward 
the 
looming 
elephant in the room that visits 
Ann Arbor eight days from now.
It’s 
an 
understandable 
inclination in any season, when 
Michigan’s matchup with Ohio 
State is circled on calendars 
years 
in 
advance. 
That’s 
especially true this year, when 
that matchup is the Wolverines’ 
one remaining chance to define 
their season as a success.
So, no matter what Michigan 
says, this week will always be 
viewed through a unique lens: 
How does it affect the Ohio 
State game?
With that in mind, The Daily 
breaks down what to watch for 
as the Wolverines attempt to 
answer the questions they face 
before the Buckeyes come to 
town.
Shea building on momentum
A month ago, the resounding 
dialogue 
surrounding 
Shea 
Patterson’s season was to write 
it off as a failure. In nearly every 
statistical 
category, 
he 
had 
regressed from a stellar 2018 as 
he appeared uncomfortable in 
Josh Gattis’ pro-spread, read-
based offense.
Late in the first half against 
Penn State five weeks ago, 
Patterson hit his nadir, sulking 
off the field after a hideous 
screen-pass interception as the 

Nittany Lions surrounded him 
in celebration.
Since then, he’s done a 180, 
offering a masterclass in how 
to run Gattis’ offense. Over the 
Wolverines last three games, 
he’s completed 43 of 67 passes 
for 635 yards, seven touchdowns 
and zero interceptions, peaking 
with a career-high 384 yards 
against Michigan State last 
weekend.
Even 
against 
the 
reeling 
Spartans, that game offered 
a 
glimpse 
of 
Patterson’s 
dynamic potential — the type 
of performance Michigan will 
need in order to overcome 15 
years’ worth of demons against 
Ohio State a week from now.
In the present, it’s also the 
type of performance that will 
ensure the Wolverines don’t 
have any trouble with Indiana. 
The Hoosiers are passing for 
over 300 yards per game this 
year — a mark Patterson hadn’t 
hit in his Michigan career 
before Saturday.
A repeat of the mediocre 
performances that marred the 
beginning of Patterson’s season 
could leave Michigan struggling 
to catch up, introducing much 
more prescient questions than 
what comes a week from now.
How 
Michigan 
defends 
a 
high-octane, 
pass-first 
offense
Speaking of Indiana’s passing 
attack, this weekend will pit the 
Wolverines’ defense against an 
offensive style that they haven’t 
faced all season.
That in itself will provide 
a unique challenge for Don 
Brown’s defense, but it also 
carries larger implications. The 
Hoosiers’ pro-spread, one-back 
offense offers a watered-down 
version of Ohio State’s offense 
that torched Michigan for 62 
points a year ago.
That game brought the type 
of large-scale questions that 
have rarely faced Brown in his 
time at Michigan. They centered 
on the Buckeyes’ use of crossing 
patterns, getting their talented 

receiving corps in space against 
Brown’s man defense.
This 
year, 
Brown 
has 
responded 
with 
more 
zone 
defense than he’s ever used, 
countering the mesh concepts 
that 
teams 
like 
Iowa 
and 
Michigan State have used in 
their 
attempts 
to 
replicate 
Ohio State’s success. Saturday, 
though, will be the most stern 
test of the Wolverines’ zone 
defense, against one of the few 
pass-first offenses the Big Ten 
has to offer.
How Michigan responds will 
dictate expectations against the 
Buckeyes a week from now.
Can Ronnie Bell get in the 
end zone?
Okay, so maybe this one 
doesn’t 
affect 
Michigan’s 
chances against Ohio State.
It’s still fun to think about 
— something to watch for if 
the Wolverines break out to 
an early lead on Saturday and 
erase any doubt over the game’s 
outcome. Bell has been among 
Michigan’s brightest offensive 
stars this season, with his 67.8 
yards per game the most from 
a Wolverines’ receiver since 
Jeremy Gallon’s 105.6 in 2013.
It has been a revelation 
from Bell, who caught just 

eight passes a year ago, but has 
flourished in Gattis’ offense.
And yet, he still hasn’t found 
the 
end 
zone. 
It’s 
become 
a running joke among the 
Wolverines, with players chiding 
Bell each time he returns to the 
sidelines after coming up a few 
familiar yards short.
Breaking his streak against 
the Buckeyes would surely be 
more satisfying, but with just 
two games to play, Bell will take 
any touchdown he can get.
Prediction
When Vegas’ opening line set 
Michigan as 7-point favorites, 
the 
natural 
reaction 
was 
surprise. This is a matchup the 
Wolverines are annually favored 
in by 20 points and one they 
haven’t lost since 1987.
And yet, it was also fair, with 
the Hoosiers having pushed 
Penn State to the brink in State 
College last week. Since then, 
the line has opened up to 10, a 
reflection of Michigan’s brand 
name and current form.
Despite Indiana’s offensive 
prowess, that form should be 
too much for the Hoosiers to 
overcome, even if it’s far less 
comfortable than the Wolverines 
would like.
Michigan, 31-24

Chuck Raab’s empty seat

About an hour before every 
home 
game, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball coaches hold 
what’s called a “Chalk Talk” for 
the season-ticket holders. It’s 
essentially an opportunity for 
the die-hard fans to hear how 
the coaches feel about the game 
and ask a few questions before 
tip-off.
Chuck 
Raab 
never 
went 
to 
a single Chalk 
Talk. 
The 
way 
he 
saw it, he had 
his own job to 
do. Every game, 
as soon as the 
doors opened an 
hour and a half 
before 
tip-off, 
Chuck would scamper down 
to the courtside seats that he’d 
owned since 2003, pull out the 
personalized signs he’d made 
for each player and cheer on the 
team as they went through their 
warmups. 
Many of the players would 
greet Chuck on the sideline, 
and he always responded with 
a warm smile, a high five and 
words of encouragement. 
Chuck passed away on Nov. 6. 
He was 69 years 
old. As the most 
loyal 
supporter 
of 
women’s 
basketball in Ann 
Arbor — if not the 
entire country — 
he left a stamp on 
the program far 
greater than the 
cost of his now 
vacant courtside 
seat. 
“He 
touched 
each and every one of (our 
players),” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “The amount 
of phone calls I got when Chuck 
passed, from years even before 
me. … Each one of them had their 
own special relationship with 
him.”
***
It’s no secret that the women’s 

basketball team doesn’t get the 
attention it probably deserves at 
Michigan. Despite winning the 
NIT Championship in 2017 and 
making the NCAA Tournament 
each of the past two seasons, 
the Wolverines play their home 
games in front of a mostly-
empty arena. Rows beyond the 
baselines are often spotted with 
one or two fans, and the upper-
level seats are blocked off by a 
black curtain. 
None of that 
ever mattered to 
Chuck. 
Through 
16 
seasons, 
three 
head 
coaches 
and four NCAA 
Tournament 
bids, 
Chuck 
was a constant 
presence 
on 
the 
sideline. 
Even in the lowest of times 
— say, an abysmal 2004-2007 
stretch where Michigan went a 
combined 4-44 in Big Ten play 
— he was there, a maize and blue 
Hulk glove on one hand and a 
“Go Blue!” sign in the other. 
“(He) had a really big impact 
for a lot of years,” said sophomore 
guard Danielle Rauch. “Just to 
know that there’s someone that 
really believed in us that hard, 
drove us to want to do good and 
make him proud, 
because he had 
so much belief 
in us. … He just 
thought we were 
the 
greatest, 
and that’s really 
special.”
Even for road 
games, 
Chuck 
always 
made 
sure 
the 
team 
knew 
he 
was 
behind them. For 
the first few hundred feet of 
countless bus rides to the team’s 
road games, Chuck was always 
right alongside, shouting words 
of encouragement and waving 
his maize and blue flag. And 
when they came back from the 
road trip — keep in mind that 
this is a winter sport in Michigan 
— he’d be right there, ready to 

congratulate them on a job well 
done. 
“I can remember nights when 
we came home at two, three in 
the morning after great wins on 
the road, and Chuck would be out 
front ready to greet us,” Barnes 
Arico said. “The times where 
we’d be in the middle of the 
snowstorm, and he’d be waiting 
on the corner … he’d have his 
Michigan flag, and he’d run up as 
far as he could until our bus took 
off.”
***
Beyond the typical greetings 
and high fives before and after 
games, the team took special 
notice when Chuck went through 
struggles of his own. During his 
first brush with cancer some 
years back, the team knew they 
had to somehow return the favor 
for his years of loyalty. 
So, they repaid him with a gift 
truly fitting for their biggest fan 
— a team photo signed by every 
coach and player, something he 
treasured for the rest of his life. 
“He venerated that object 
so much,” his son, Jason Raab, 
said. “He got very emotional 
when we talked about it. He 
told me how grateful he was 
for it, and he just couldn’t 
believe they would do that for 
him. Despite all the support he 
showed the team, he was just a 
really humble guy, so that really 
demonstrated his passion and his 
humility regarding the women’s 
basketball team.”
Jason had been aware of 
his dad’s love for the women’s 
basketball program, but it wasn’t 
until the funeral that he found 
out how far it really went. Every 
member of the current team 
attended the funeral and met 
with the Raab family afterward 
— another testament to the 
impact that Chuck had on them 
as people. They shared stories 
about Chuck’s passion for the 
game and what he meant to 
the program. One player — 
sophomore forward Emily Kiser 
— showed the family a video of 
Chuck running alongside the 
bus as they took off for a road 
game. 
***

Looking back, Jason chuckled 
at the sight. “That was one of 
the first times I’d ever seen my 
dad run, certainly that late in 
his life, so that was really cool 
to see.”
Part of what made the video 
so special was how the Chuck 
running 
alongside 
the 
bus 
differed from the man that 
his family knew at home. It 
wasn’t that he wasn’t positive 
or enthusiastic about life — 
positivity is something that 
Jason emphasized about his 

father — it was just that he 
showed it more quietly at home. 
“Most 
of 
his 
defining 
characteristics that you see at 
the game, he had at home, just 
minus the volume,” Jason said. 
“Anything that (my two sisters 
and I) would have wanted to look 
into, or any pursuits that we had, 
he would have been supporting 
us, with the same unconditional 
positivity, 
just 
without 
the 
jumping and screaming.”
The team played its first 
game without Chuck on Nov. 

8, notching a 76-55 victory 
over Western Michigan. Jason 
and the rest of the Raab family 
watched 
from 
the 
stands, 
reveling in a program that 
Chuck had dedicated nearly two 
decades of his life to. 
Barnes 
Arico 
says 
that 
Chuck’s seat is theirs if they 
want it. Jason stressed his 
father’s generosity as one of his 
defining traits. 
And his last generous gift to 
his family will be a courtside 
seat.

COURTESTY OF MICHIGAN ATHLETICS
Michigan women’s basketball superfan Chuck Rabb passed away on Nov. 6 after a battle with cancer.

Howard, ‘M’ ready 
for Houston Baptist

Who cares about a late-
November 
game 
against 
Houston Baptist? What even is 
Houston Baptist?
Hopefully, by the end of 
this, you’ll have both of these 
questions answered. Even in 
the 
supposed 
“throwaway” 
segments of the schedule, great 
games and lessons be found.
Last 
year, 
the 
Houston 
Baptist men’s basketball team 
walked into Winston-Salem, 
N.C. and left with a shocking 
victory over Wake Forest.
It was one of the early-
season upsets that rocks the 
college basketball world and 
does wonders for one lucky 
mid-major program. This year, 
early indicators suggest it was 
Evansville’s wild victory over 
then-No. 1 Kentucky.
All of that is to say that the 
Huskies have set a precedent 
for upsetting major programs 
in early tune-up games that are 
supposed to serve as automatic 
wins before power conference 
opponents hit the bulk of 
their season. Houston Baptist 
has already squandered an 
opportunity at such an upset 
just last week after falling to 
No. 12 Texas Tech, 103-74, 
last week. The Huskies are 
not looking to make the same 
mistake twice.
In order to pull off the 
improbable, Houston Baptist is 
going to have to rely heavily on 
the efficiency of its up-tempo 
offense which runs through 
junior guard Ian DuBose and 
senior guard Jalon Gates. 
DuBose — an instrumental 
part of the Huskies’ win over 
the Demon Deacons last year — 
is averaging 16.3 points and 6.7 
rebounds per game, building 
off a season that saw him 
finish on the second team all-

Southerland Conference. 
In one way or another, the 
surprising early season wins 
have 
an 
additional 
factor 
fueling the team to what may 
feel like a predestined outcome. 
Last year against Wake Forest, 
it came from the environment. 
DuBose 
and 
many 
of 
his 
teammates 
hail 
from 
the 
tobacco state and wanted to 
put on a show for their friends 
and families who drove up to 
attend.
“The 
environment 
was 
great,” DuBose told The Daily. 
“It raised our level of play. We 
were making shots, defending 
well, and everything was just 
clicking. I think that really 
helped us win. And I think just 
being at home.”
In the absence of such 
factors, it may be difficult 
to envision Houston Baptist 
pulling out a win in Crisler 
Center, but a willing opponent 
can never be written off in 
college basketball.
Beyond 
that 
program-
defining 
win, 
DuBose 
has 
experience going up against 
some of the best competition 
in the country — especially at 
point guard. Two seasons prior, 
both DuBose and Gates faced 
off against Michigan State’s 
now-All-American point guard 
Cassius Winston.
While that game was a 
40-point blowout, DuBose and 
Gates were the only ones who 
seemed capable of generating 
any offense, scoring 10 and 
17 points, respectively. The 
test now will be to see if the 
backcourt duo can replicate 
this 
action 
against 
senior 
guard Zavier Simpson — an 
astute player known for his 
lock-down defensive prowess.

Hallahan’s winding road to Michigan stardom

Watching 
Jack 
Hallahan 
roam the soccer pitch is, simply 
put, mesmerizing. 
He dances through opposing 
defenses, weaving in and out of 
crevices not usually traversed. 
His feet control the ball so 
smoothly the defense might 
as well be on ice, gliding left 
with one foot then dragging 
back across with the other. 
Give him an inch of separation 
and he’ll rifle in crosses that 
find teammates with magnetic 
precision.
When it’s all said and done, 
Hallahan will go down in 
history as one of the best to 
ever wear the Michigan soccer 
uniform. How did he get to this 
point? To best understand his 
brilliance, one ought to retrace 
the steps of his winding soccer 
journey. 
It’s a story that all starts 
with a five-year-old blonde boy 
across the pond. 
***
Redditch, England, is crazed 
for soccer — it’s no different 
than any other English town in 
that sense. Most of its 110,000 
residents live and breathe the 
sport they call “football.” By the 
time he turned five, Hallahan 
was one of them. 
“It’s not like in America 
where you have a choice to 
play ice hockey, basketball or 
American football,” Hallahan 
said. “It’s more just like that’s 
where you go to meet people, 
to make friends. It’s the main 
sport, so it’s a social thing.”
Hallahan’s entry into soccer 
may 
have 
been 
for 
social 
purposes, but the game soon 
grew 
to 
encompass 
much 
more. Like any other child, 
Hallahan fantasized over his 
boyhood idols, reading books on 
Liverpool star Steven Gerrard 
off the pitch and attempting to 
emulate Gerrard’s play at center 
midfield on it. 
Not 
every 
soccer-playing 
English schoolboy, though, is 
scouted by Aston Villa at the age 
of eight. 
“That was just the first 
indication that I was pretty 
good,” Hallahan said. “That I 
could really compete.”
While 
an 
opportunity 
at 
Aston Villa never materialized, 
it didn’t take long for other 
clubs to catch on to Hallahan’s 
talent. West Bromwich Albion 
discovered Hallahan a few years 
later and, freshly into double-
digits, 
11-year-old 
Hallahan 
aced his tryout, signing with the 
academy team. 
In his first game against 
Cardiff City, Hallahan scored a 
goal. For the first time, he felt 
established as a soccer player. 
Hallahan would play in West 
Brom’s 
youth 
academy 
for 
seven years, receiving his first 
taste of a professional soccer 
environment. 
“It was massive,” Hallahan 
said. 
“You’re 
around 
really 
talented players. There’s a lot 
of competition going on, so that 
really brought out the best in 

you. It was both challenging 
and fun at the same time.”
The stint at West Brom 
gave 
Hallahan’s 
raw 
talent 
a 
formidable 
avenue 
for 
development. 
What 
came 
calling next, though, really 
proved that he had the potential 
to be special. 
***
Hallahan’s mother, Michelle, 
is English. His father, Will, is 
Irish. 
When 
it 
came 
to 
the 
possibility of representing a 
national team, only one country 
beckoned. 
“I never got a call from 
England, 
but 
I 
just 
kept 
playing,” Hallahan said. “But 
then Ireland called me up and 
I was like, ‘Wow, it’s a great 
opportunity. I have to go for it.’ 
”
Despite 
being 
raised 
in 
England, Hallahan had always 
been proud of his Irish heritage. 
Playing for the U-18 and U-19 
national teams allowed him to, 
for the first time, fully embrace 
it. 
“Me playing for Ireland, it 
really brought together two 
sides of the family,” Hallahan 
said. “I have a lot of family out 
there, and it was brilliant to be 
able to represent them.”
In 2014, Hallahan debuted 
for the U-18 team, playing two 
friendlies against the Czech 
Republic and scoring a goal in 
the second one. As a member 
of the U-19 squad, he notched 
two goals in two games against 
Azerbaijan and also appeared in 
other international friendlies 
against Sweden and Mexico. 
In 
the 
UEFA 
Euro 
U-19 
qualifiers, Hallahan’s play was 
instrumental in the team’s run 
into the knockout rounds. 
International 
experience 
provided Hallahan a global 
perspective 
on 
the 
sport, 
broadening his horizons beyond 
the English playing field. 
“Ireland, they’re grinders,” 
Hallahan 
said. 
“There’s 
probably 
less 
talent 
than 
England’s national team, but 
there’s 
some 
real 
grinding 
lads who put in a lot of hard 
work. It certainly brought out a 
different side of my game, more 
of a team effort than a bunch of 
individuals.”
***
Michigan 
associate 
coach 
Tommy McMenemy first caught 
wind of Jack Hallahan thanks to 
a tip from a connection he had in 
England. The colleague reached 
out to McMenemy to tell him 
about a talented soccer player 
who was seeking a different 
opportunity, someone eager for 
a fresh start after years in the 
grueling English soccer system. 
McMenemy, 
serving 
as 
Michigan’s 
recruiting 
coordinator 
at 
the 
time, 
proceeded as he normally did 
when tipped off on a recruit — 
he watched game film and did 
some research on Hallahan’s 
make-up 
and 
academic 
intentions. 
Immediately, he was sold. 
He 
booked 
a 
flight 
to 
England to watch Hallahan 

play in person. He still recalls 
the potential he saw. The 
game just came naturally to 
Hallahan. Yet what impressed 
McMenemy more than his skill 
was his play style — his grit, his 
determination, his drive. 
“College soccer sometimes 
isn’t very friendly to talented 
players 
who 
want 
to 
be 
comfortable,” McMenemy said. 
“But when I watched Jack play, 
he had a very competitive edge 
underneath the skull that I 
thought would hold him well in 
the college game.”
McMenemy, 
of 
course, 
speaks from experience. Fifteen 
years earlier, he had been in 
Hallahan’s 
shoes 
himself, 
daring to test the collegiate 
soccer waters at Columbia while 
leaving 
behind 
his 
English 
career and his hometown of 
Southampton. 
McMenemy 
recognized 
that 
Hallahan 
possessed the persona and work 
ethic imperative to flourish on 
the college scene.
“He just had an appreciation 
for what America could offer 
him,” McMenemy said. “He’s 
from a very hardworking family. 
When I went over to recruit 
him, actually he was working a 
shift at the local pub. So I knew 
he wasn’t afraid to put the work 
in, to have some humility about 
him.”
At 
the 
time, 
Hallahan 
was 
considering 
numerous 
big time soccer programs in 
America. Michigan’s wealth of 
opportunities beyond athletics 
made Ann Arbor the prohibitive 
favorite as a landing spot. 
“It was just a great school 
academically, and the football 
program was on the rise,” 
Hallahan said. “I had a great 
relationship 
with 
(Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley) and Tommy, 
they were very personable. It 
felt like a good place to call 
home for the next four years.”
In general, leaving a soccer 
hotbed like England to come 
play 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
where soccer is less culturally-
ingrained, might appear to be 
an odd move. But in England, 
Hallahan’s career was at a 
crossroads, 
and 
collegiate 
soccer presented itself as the 
best window to grow both as a 
player and person. 
It 
didn’t 
take 
long 
for 
Hallahan to realize that he 
made the right decision. 
“At first, I didn’t really have 
the bigger picture of what the 
soccer would be like,” Hallahan 
said. “But when I came in, I was 
pleasantly surprised by how 
good a lot of the players were, 
how accomplished a lot of 
my teammates were. It was 
a nice fit, honestly straight 
away.”
***
Though 
he 
received 
significant 
playing 
time 
as a freshman, Hallahan’s 
ascension 
into 
collegiate 
stardom 
truly 
began 
his 
sophomore season. Over his last 
three seasons, Hallahan has 
been one of the most prolific 
players in the Big Ten and the 
lynchpin of Michigan’s success.

“You’ve seen a young lad, 
you know, maybe lacking some 
confidence, turn into a young 
man that wants the ball in 
big moments and big games,” 
McMenemy said. “And that’s all 
you can ask from a young player 
in his junior, senior year.”
Hallahan is set to end his 
Michigan career as one of 
the 
most-decorated 
players 
in school history. He is the 
first Wolverine to win first-
team All-Big Ten honors in 
three consecutive seasons, and 
captured Big Ten Offensive 
Player of the Year as a junior in 
2018. With 73 career points, he 
holds the second-highest point-
total in Michigan men’s soccer 
history. 
Hallahan, 
though, 
doesn’t 
spend too much time focusing 
on his personal accolades. 
“If we’re losing or he’s not 
having a good day, you can see 
Jack kind of roll up his sleeves 
and get a look in his eye,” 
McMenemy said. “He wants to 
win, he wants to win now and he 
wants to play his best football. 
When that’s not happening, 
you can see him go through 
the gears to make it 
happen. 
He’s 
got a real 

winning 
mentality.”
It should be no surprise, then, 
that Hallahan considers his 
proudest moment at Michigan 
to be when the team won the 
Big Ten his sophomore season. 
Or that his favorite goal is not 
his flashiest, but rather one in a 
game last year against Maryland 
that helped seal the team’s 
NCAA Tournament berth. 
“I just love helping the team 
accomplish 
the 
things 
we 
deserve,” he said. 
***
Hallahan isn’t exactly sure 
what he wants to do with his life 
post-college — he only knows he 
has a steadfast desire for soccer 
to be a part of it. 
Whatever 
direction 
he 
goes in, McMenemy knows 
Hallahan will be well-prepared. 
Rebuking a common stereotype 
of a student-athlete, Hallahan 
— an economics major with a 
piqued interest in psychology 

— is well-devoted to his studies. 
“He’s just really embraced 
the academic side of Michigan,” 
McMenemy said. “It’s never 

been an issue with him. He’s 
taken advantage of all the 
opportunities 
Michigan 
has 
to offer. Just a great example 
of what we want in a student-
athlete.”
For now, though, Hallahan’s 
time as an athlete at Michigan 
is 
winding 
down 
toward 
its 
inevitable 
end. 
The 
Wolverines open play in the 
NCAA Tournament on Sunday 
against 
Wright 
State, 
each 
game possibly Hallahan’s last 
donning the maize and blue. 
When the time ultimately 
comes, Hallahan will leave his 
legacy at Michigan behind and 
move on to the next step of his 
soccer journey. Michigan, 
though, is a stop he will 
not soon forget. 
“I’ve 
loved 
it,” 
Hallahan said. “It’s 
an 
experience 
I’ll 
remember 
forever.”
