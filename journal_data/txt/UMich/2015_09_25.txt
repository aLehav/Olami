ADMINISTRATION

Common thread in 
search for ‘culture 
shift’ is heightening 

students’ role

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

and MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily Staff Reporter 

and Daily News Editor

Days after the release of new 

sexual assault data from a survey 
conducted by the Association of 
American Universities, Univer-
sity administrators stressed in 
an exclusive interview with The 
Michigan Daily on Thursday 
that they remain committed to 
preventing sexual misconduct 
— while also acknowledging 
that some of their efforts are not 
reaching students as effectively 
as they’d hope.

Twenty-eight schools partici-

pated in the AAU survey, includ-
ing the University. Compared 
to other schools, many of the 

University’s results showed both 
higher instances of sexual assault 
and higher disillusion with the 
process of adjudicating it.

Nationwide, 11.7 percent of 

surveyed college students expe-
rienced nonconsensual sexual 
contact as a result of force or inca-
pacitation since entering college, 
according to the survey. The fig-
ure was 14.6 percent at the Uni-
versity.

Whereas 63.3 percent of all 

students surveyed felt campus 
officials would take a report of 
sexual misconduct seriously, only 
40.2 percent of University stu-
dents surveyed believed this to 
be true.

Research 
Prof. 
William 

Axinn, a survey research expert, 
explained that though the differ-
ences in these numbers appear 
meaningful, they lack statisti-
cal significance. For example, he 
said, after several students at the 
University voiced concerns about 
potentially triggering language 
in the AAU survey, that language

Concussion lawyer Steven Pachman speaks about the legal process associated with concussion cases to attendees of the University of Michigan Injury Center 
Sport Concussion Summit at the Junge Family Campions Center on Thursday. 

Researchers focus 
on evaluating long-
term impacts for 
student-athletes

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

At a conference hosted by the 

University’s Injury Center on 
Thursday, speakers discussed 
how sports-related concussions, 

an issue that has attracted atten-
tion in recent years from high-
profile incidents in the NFL and 
college athletics, impacts stu-
dent-athletes.

The Injury Center hosted the 

Sport Concussion Summit at the 
Junge Family Champions Center, 
attached to Crisler Arena. Dur-
ing the day-long event, speakers 
from various fields related to 
sports injuries touched on topics 
such as concussion science, team 
policies, the influence of media 
and legal implications.

Steven Broglio, the associate 

professor of athletic training 
who was the event’s director and 
moderator, said the summit pro-
vided a chance to explain the lat-
est research on the topic.

“(The summit) is an opportu-

nity to educate the public, and 
not only athletes, but research-
ers, scientists, clinicians that 
are interested in this,” he said. 
“We’re really trying to show 
what the science is behind the 
injury as opposed to what is 
often portrayed in the media.”

Last fall, the topic generated 

significant attention when then-
sophomore quarterback Shane 
Morris was allowed back on the 
field after suffering a “probable, 
mild” concussion during a Sept. 
27, 2014 game against Minne-
sota.

Lloyd Carr, former head coach 

of the Michigan football team, 
gave the opening remarks. The 
keynote address was given by 
Brian Hainline, chief medical 
officer for the NCAA.

STATE GOVERNMENT

Oakland, Eastern 
Michigan University 
presidents explain 
choice to exceed limit

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

Representatives from Eastern 

Michigan University and Oak-
land University testified Thurs-
day before a joint meeting of 
the Michigan House and Senate 
Appropriations 
subcommittees 

on higher education to explain 
their tuition hikes for the current 
year, which, unlike the Univer-
sity’s, exceeded state limits.

Though University officials 

were not involved in Thursday’s 
hearing, 
conversation 
about 

tuition caps and the incentives 
that drive them do have an impact 
on the University’s process for 
setting tuition rates.

EMU raised tuition by 7.8 

percent and Oakland University 
raised tuition by 8.48 percent, 
above the 3.2-percent limit set by 
the state as a condition of receiv-
ing part of a 2-percent increase 
in state funding. The University 
raised tuition this year by 2.7 per-
cent for in-state students, con-
sistent with the cap. It has not 
exceeded it in past years either.

Performance-based 
funding 

for all universities, tied to both 
caps on tuition and six other 
aspects of performance — includ-
ing six-year graduation rates, 
degree completion in critical 
areas and administrative costs — 
have been in place since 2012.

Because their tuition rates 

exceeds state limits, EMU and 
Oakland are forfeiting $1 million 
and $1.2 million, respectively, in 
state incentive funding. However, 
the hikes will earn EMU $10 mil-
lion this year in additional tuition 
revenue. Oakland will make an 
extra $12 million in tuition.

Suzanne Lee 
discusses work 
growing clothes 
from microbes

By TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Suzanne 
Lee’s 
fashion 

design 
studio 
is 
different 

than most. It’s not filled with 
sketches and silks, but instead 
occupied by vats of microbes 

bubbling away while they feast 
on sugars to produce her latest 
clothing line.

In the first of this year’s 

Penny Stamps Speaker Series, 
Lee spoke to a packed Michigan 
Theater about the intersection 
of synthetic biology and design. 
She discussed her involvement 
in the multidisciplinary field, 
from growing clothes in micro-
bial vats to growing cow skin to 
produce leather in a way that 
doesn’t involve slaughtering.

Lee described her job as cre-

ative director at the biodesign 

firm Biocouture, where she has 
been making garments derived 
from microbial cellulose, say-
ing she was influenced by her 
fascination with the future and 
concerns about sustainability 
in fashion.

“Rather than think about 

growing a plant like cotton in 
a field to obtain fiber, where 
you’re throwing away 99 per-
cent of that plant just to get 
these fibers that need to be 
spun and woven into a fabric,

CAMPUS LIFE

Young Americans 
for Freedom host 

House Budget 

chairman

By BRIAN KUANG

For the Daily

U.S. Rep. Tom Price (R–Ga.), a 

University alum, visited campus 
Thursday evening to address the 
Young Americans for Freedom 
on topics including healthcare 
reform and Donald Trump.

A recurring theme throughout 

Price’s discussion to a crowd of 
around 40 in the Michigan Union 
was his goal to limit federal regu-
lation and involvement in busi-
ness and other realms.

Price, also the chairman of 

the House Budget Committee, 
pointed to the issues of balloon-
ing college tuition and what he 
says are entitlement costs from 
programs such as Medicare and 
Social Security. He argued that 
the delegation of more authority 
to individual states would signifi-

cantly lower costs by allowing 
states and individuals to under-
take more efficient solutions.

He 
emphasized 
that 
col-

lege tuition increases could be 
reduced by allowing students to 
take low-interest loans directly 
from private banks, stating that 
direct federal subsidies to higher 
education are responsible for the 
rapid inflation of college costs.

“Do you know why the (fed-

eral student loan interest rate) is 
6.8 percent?” he said. “Because 
the government says it’s got to 
be 6.8 percent regardless of what 
the market says … you could go 
out and get a loan from a bank 
for 3- to 4-percent interest if we 
allowed the banks to do what 
they’re supposed to do.”

In response to audience ques-

tions, Price didn’t specify a 
preference among the Repub-
lican primary field for the 2016 
presidential election, expressing 
admiration for a variety of can-
didates.

“I think this is probably a 

Rubio-Kasich-Bush 
race,” 
he 

said, referring to Sen. Marco 
Rubio (Fla.), Ohio Gov. John 
Kasich and former Florida Gov. 
Jeb Bush.

He also expressed surprise at 

the success of the outsider can-
didates Donald Trump, Carly 
Fiorina and Ben Carson, noting 
concern with the leadership style 
of Donald Trump.

“What concerns me about 

Trump is not necessarily his 

policy positions, but we know 
what it feels like to have a presi-
dent that oversteps their bounds 
on regulations and rules,” Price 
said, 
referring 
to 
President 

Barack Obama. “And when I hear 
Trump saying things like ‘I’ll just 
do XYZ’ without seemingly any 
regard for the legislative branch, 
it gives me some thought.”

Price also heavily criticized 

the Affordable Care Act, drawing 
from his experience as a prac-
ticing physician and long-time 
opponent to government-man-
dated healthcare coverage.

Though conceding that the 

extension of healthcare coverage 
to a larger portion of the popula-
tion is a positive development, 
he said the bill undermines the 
direct doctor-patient relation-
ship.

“(The ACA) works for the 

government and insurance com-
panies, but not for patients,” he 
said.

Price argued that the ideal 

healthcare system should be 
accessible, affordable and of high 
quality, while also possessing 
the capacity for responsiveness, 
innovation and patient choice.

“(The ACA) violates the prin-

ciples that everyone holds dear, 
whether you’re on the left side of 
the spectrum or the right side of 
the spectrum,” he said.

He also touched on a health-

care reform bill introduced by 
his Republican colleagues in the 
House in 2013, the Empowering 
Patients First Act, which sought 
to provide universal coverage 
without mandates as a replace-
ment for the Affordable Care Act.

Price is also scheduled to 

speak at the Medical School 
tomorrow as part of a series of 
talks with alumni. In a view-
point submitted to The Michigan 
Daily, a group of Medical School 
students cited several parts of 
Price’s record they said didn’t 
align with their values as future 
doctors, including his vote ear-
lier this week to defund Planned 
Parenthood and votes against 
legislation to prevent LGBTQ 
discrimination, as well as the 
Violence Against Women Act.

Apart from politics, Thursday 

night’s discussion also had more 
lighthearted moments, such as 
Price reflecting fondly on his 
time at the University, where he 
enrolled as an undergraduate in 
1972.

“One of the big activities that 

we had in ’73 and ’74 were the 
Watergate hearings, and we 
would gather in the East Quad 
common area with a television, 
huddled around watching the 
Watergate hearings and not 
attending class,” he said to laugh-
ter from the audience.

LSA sophomore Grant Strobl, 

YAF chair, said the group wanted 
to bring Price to campus because 
he is an alum who encompasses 
many of their views about size of 
government and business.

“At the University, it’s impor-

tant to think critically and dis-
cuss the big issues,” he said. “And 
I think that having a group like 
ours that advances these beliefs 
is a mutual benefit in that we cre-
ate that dialogue on campus that 
wouldn’t otherwise exist.”

Society of Women Engineers 
hosts summer camp in Liberia

Students 

aim to foster 
inter-cultural 
connections

BY IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s Society of 

Women Engineers has expand-
ed — to Liberia.

Members of the society trav-

eled to Liberia to host a two-
week 
engineering 
leadership 

camp for female Liberian engi-
neering university students. The 
camp, Setting Up Collegiate for 
Careers in Engineering through 
Social Support Camp, was held 
at the Peace Corps Training 
Facility at Kakata, Liberia.

A total of 40 students — five 

University 
Ph.D. 
candidates, 

five University undergraduate 
students and 30 Liberian under-
graduate students from three 
different Liberian universities 
— participated in the summer 
camp.

Sara Rimer, an environmental 

engineering graduate student 
and one of the students who ini-
tially launched the student part-
nership between the University 
and the Liberian university, said 
the summer camp had several 
goals.

First, the camp aimed to help 

bridge the gap between the two 
groups of students, with the 
hope of fostering peer support 
for students from both countries 
working toward careers in engi-
neering.

“We wanted a peer-to-peer 

network to develop that was 
cross-cultural,” Rimer said. “We 
noticed that international expe-
riences are huge for (Univer-
sity) undergraduates, but a lot 
of them don’t necessarily have 
the peer aspect, where they go 
to another country and develop 
relationships with peers in that 
country.”

The cross-cultural networks 

also exposed participants to 
cultural similarities and differ-
ences between the United States 
and Liberia.

Engineering senior Breosh-

shala Martin said since she is 
African American, it was inter-
esting to see how she and the 
Liberian students were similar 
but also different.

“The 
cultural 
differences 

weren’t something that I was 
used to, but there were some 
things that are similar to my 
culture back home,” Martin 
said. “There were things (the 
Liberian students) did that hap-
pened in my family and things 
they said that I say to my friends 
often.”

In addition, the camp provid-

ed hands-on engineering activi-
ties, which are not typically 
integrated into the curriculum 
at Liberian universities.

The 
University 
members 

also worked with the Liberian 
students in developing a SWE 
chapter at their school. Though 
Liberia-SWE was founded in 
2013, events such as last year’s 
Ebola outbreak caused setbacks 
at the universities. Since 2013, 
the Liberian students have only 
had two semesters of five weeks 

each.

“Since 2013, their whole lives 

have been on a hiatus,” Rimer 
said. “Peers from the U.S. have a 
lot of experience and have suc-
cessfully ran the organization, 
so they can provide perspective, 
ideas and advice as input.”

Overall, the camp focused 

on helping Liberian students 
acquire life skills that are not 
taught in their classroom, such 
as professional development, 
Rimer said.

Edith Tarplah, a University 

of Liberia junior and L-SWE 
president, wrote in the Univer-
sity’s graduate SWE blog that 
the leadership camp has been 
like a “miracle” for her and other 
female 
Liberian 
engineering 

students, especially because it 
is difficult being a female engi-
neering student in Liberia.

“It is difficult to be a female 

student in Liberia, yet alone say 
an engineering female student,” 
Tarplah wrote. “Having other 
female 
engineering 
students 

giving up their time to come 
to Liberia to encourage and 
promote networking amongst 
engineering student and pro-
fessionals, giving students the 
opportunity of having a one-
on-one conversation about their 
field of studies and how things 
actually work in the real world 
is a miracle.”

Rimer said SWE plans to con-

tinue to foster the relationship 
with the Liberian students with 
hopes that this relationship will 
serve as a model for other cross-
cultural connections.

University 
releases report on 
fracking practices

University 
researchers 

released findings from a three- 
year study on hydraulic fracking. 
Fracking, which injects mixtures 
of water, chemicals and sand deep 
underground to open cracks in 
sediment, thereby releasing oil or 
natural gas, has sparked a national 
debate. Though the report takes 
no stance on the use of fracking, it 
includes suggestions for how the 
public can become more involved 
in shaping fracking policies. 

Founders of 
Nutshell to create 
local tech hub

Guy Suter, Lindsay Snider 

and Ian Berry, the founders of 
Nutshell, a customer relationship 
management 
software, 

purchased 
three 
properties 

in downtown Ann Arbor. The 
purchasers 
plan 
to 
open 
a 

portion of the 24,000 square feet 
to other Ann Arbor tech startups. 
According to city records, the 
three properties were purchased 
for approximately $6 million. 

Mud Bowl event 
to continue after 
roadblocks

Former members of the Sigma 

Alpha Epsilon fraternity will now 
host the annual Mud Bowl as an 
independent organization, unaf-
filiated with SAE or any other 
other organization. Because the 
SAE house is owned by alumni, 
not by the fraternity’s national 
organization, they say they can 
host the event without affiliation.

The former SAE chapter house 

at 1408 Washtenaw Ave. will still 
serve as the event’s venue.

Former SAE President Brett 

Mizzi, a Business senior, said the 
organization has developed a risk 
management plan, hired security 
and purchased insurance for the 
event. 

Mizzi said as University stu-

dents, the event’s organizers have 
the right to assemble on private 
property.

The University’s Office of Greek 

Life had attempted to apply a pol-
icy that prevents current Greek 
life members from participating in 
events held by a chapter that had 
been expelled from campus. SAE 
was expelled from the Interfrater-
nity Council in 2011.

microorganism like a bacteria and 
getting that to spin the fiber,” Lee 
said.

Microbial cellulose is related 

to cellulose derived from cotton, 
which makes up a large percent-
age of commercial clothing. Lee 
outlined three main benefits of 
microbial cellulose: it is more eco-
logically sustainable to grow, it is 
much purer and it absorbs dyes, 
which are usually toxic in their liq-
uid form, much more effectively.

The process of growing micro-

bial cellulose, which takes about 
three weeks in total, involves cre-
ating a bath of nutrients, a carbon 
source and microbes. Lee accom-
plishes this with green tea, refined 
sugar and a complex community of 
yeasts and bacteria. This commu-
nity, called a symbiotic colony of 
bacteria and yeast — or SCOBY — is 
identical to that which makes the 
drink kombucha. As the microbes 
feed and multiply, they produce 
cellulose in a thick mat that can 
be later washed, dried and cut into 
fabric.

Art & Design junior Harsha 

Devaraj said he thought this pro-
cess was particularly interesting.

“The final product that she came 

out with, the jackets, were really 
cool. But I really enjoyed the pro-
cess. Seeing the time-lapse of the 
bacteria synthesizing the material 
was easily the coolest part of the 
whole thing,” he said.

Lee also talked about her 

involvement in growing cow skin 

for leather. She spoke about an 
epiphany moment she had while 
discussing lab-grown tissue with a 
synthetic biologist.

“If it was possible to grow 

human tissue in the lab, why not 
animal tissue? And in fact, why 
still require killing an animal just 
to obtain certain parts of it if it’s 
possible for us to grow the correct 
cells and just use those tissues?” 
she said.

LSA senior Léa Ono said the 

sustainability 
focus 
resonated 

with her.

“It always troubled me how 

wasteful the material process is,” 
she said. “In order to dye any fab-
ric, we have to wear gloves and a 
mask and a full body coat because 
the dyes were so toxic. So I was 
thinking about the beet dyes and 
vegetable dyes and how amazing 
it would be if we could do leather 
with mammalian cells.”

Lee said the process of “bio-

fabrication” 
through 
microbial 

cellulose was difficult to produce 
in large quantities and may have 
a limited impact on the fashion 
industry as a whole. However, cit-
ing examples of mushroom-derived 
furniture, bacterially constructed 
bricks and biofuels, Lee said inter-
sections between design and fash-
ion will be influential in decades to 
come.

“I fundamentally believe today 

that the future of creativity and 
design in working materials is real-
ly going to intersect and depend on 
what’s happening in biology,” she 
said.

mittees asked EMU President 
Kim Schatzel and Oakland 
University President George 
Hynd 
for 
their 
opinions 

regarding the performance-
based 
standards 
and 
the 

tuition cap.

The members asked wheth-

er the presidents saw the cap 
as positive reinforcement or 
punishment and what they 
thought the subcommittee 
could do to prevent such sub-
stantial tuition hikes from 
becoming a recurring trend.

Hynd said the performance 

metrics are good ones, but 
he thinks the tuition cap is 
restrictive.

“They are the ones (college 

presidents) might be able to 
have an impact on, so I think 
that makes sense,” he said. 
“The tuition restraint can be 
viewed as either a carrot or a 
stick, and I think that’s prob-
ably worthy of some discus-
sion.”

Schatzel said EMU has not 

increased its tuition rate in 
years because her school is 
committed to keeping college 
affordable and that the tuition 
remains comparatively low.

“In 2005, our tuition was 

roughly equal to that of our 
peer institutions,” she said. 
“Ten years later, our tuition is 
5 to 13 percent lower than our 
peers. With the recent tuition 
increase, 
Eastern 
remains 

13 out of 15 in tuition costs 
among Michigan’s public uni-
versities.”

Schatzel said this shows 

EMU’s financial well-being 
and has kept expenses low so 
that it has not had to increase 
tuition 
substantially 
every 

year.

“At Eastern we clearly 

understand 
that 
approxi-

mately 80 percent of every 
dollar we spend comes from 
the pockets of our students, 
and the remaining 20 percent 
comes from the taxpayers of 
the state of Michigan,” she 
said.

She also noted that fresh-

man enrollment has risen 
rapidly at EMU, and that the 
school is dedicated to pro-
viding 
students 
with 
the 

best resources. However, she 
said, it is difficult to do that 
at a university that has lower 
financial reserves than many 
other public institutions in 
the state without increasing 
tuition.

Schatzel said the majority 

of students — 87 percent — at 
EMU are Michigan residents, 
which, she said could explain 
why the school may have 
fewer 
financial 
resources 

than other schools.

She used the University of 

Michigan as an example to 
prove this point, noting 45 
percent of its student body 
is from out of state and thus 
pays 
significantly 
higher 

tuition than the majority of 
students at EMU.

Hynd echoed Schatzel’s 

sentiment and said Oakland 
wants to meet students’ pri-
orities and invest in their 
educations, but doing so on a 
limited operating budget is a 
challenge.

“Neither the university nor 

the state has generated suf-
ficient resources to meet the 
needs of our students,” he 
said. “Oakland’s all-in tuition 
rates have long priced below 
the comparable rates of our 
state peers. Although we are 
grateful and encouraged to 
see the state of Michigan has 
begun to reinvest in higher 
education through increased 
appropriations, the fact is that 
historically, Oakland has been 
underfunded.”

He said Oakland spends 

less per student than do most 
public universities in the state 
because the school receives 
less state funding than the 
statewide average.

“Oakland has done its best 

to keep tuition increases as 
manageable as possible for 
students and certainly their 
families,” he said. “These 
efforts have kept us within 
the bottom half of Michigan 
public universities when it 
comes to the all-in cost of edu-
cation.”

State Rep. Mike McCready 

(R–Birmingham), 
co-chair 

of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee on higher edu-
cation, said the two subcom-
mittees would meet again to 
further discuss these issues.

was changed in the survey dur-
ing the process of distributing it 
at other schools.

“AAU changed the way they 

did that at other campuses after 
we gave them that feedback,” 
Axinn said. “We were among 
the very first to go, and it was a 
mistake, so we helped them fix 
it further. When you say, ‘Oh, 
the statistics are different com-
ing out of different schools,’ it 
turns out they sort of did a differ-
ent survey everywhere. It’s ‘the 
same,’ but not really the same. It 
means two percentage points is 
not very big.”

Furthermore, he said, it’s 

important to remember that the 
AAU survey still featured a rela-
tively small sample; 28 schools 
are not necessarily representa-
tive of a national landscape.

Regardless of comparisons 

to peer institutions, University 
President Mark Schlissel said 
these results represent a discon-
nect between the University’s 
intentions and the end result 
when treating cases of sexual 
misconduct.

“We take every report of 

potential assault or miscon-
duct of any kind very seriously,” 
Schlissel said. “So the obvious 
problem is that we are not get-
ting that message across in a way 
that the students either hear or 
believe.”

E. Royster Harper, vice presi-

dent for student life, echoed this 
sentiment, and added that it is 
the University administration’s 
responsibility to prove wrong 

those who doubt the University’s 
intentions.

“Certainly people’s perception 

is the reality that they’ve experi-
enced,” she said. “Whatever the 
reason is, we know that is not the 
work we’re doing or the intent of 
the work that we’re doing or the 
commitment of the institution. 
So we just have to work harder 
to make sure that that assertion 
simply is not true.”

As for application of the num-

bers — both from the AAU sur-
vey and the University’s internal 
survey — Holly Rider-Milkovich, 
director of the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter, said student input will be 
essential moving forward.

“What the institution is doing 

this semester, specifically, is 
really working hard on engag-
ing with our students in many 
different ways — along with our 
faculty and staff — to take a hard, 
critical look at our current sexual 
misconduct policy and really ask 
for our students to engage with 
us on some suggestive revisions 
that are coming down the pike,” 
Milkovich said.

Harper said she plans to send 

out an all-student e-mail next 
week further elaborating upon 
the plans to involve students in 
the process of evaluating the 
University’s Student Sexual Mis-
conduct Policy.

Broadly, Milkovich said stu-

dent organizations, units of Stu-
dent Life and Central Student 
Government are partnering to 
host forums during the revision 
process. During the events, stu-
dents will have the opportunity 
to evaluate revision drafts, ask 
questions and provide feedback.

Milkovich 
also 
mentioned 

that, beyond pre-existing pro-
gramming such as Change it Up 
or Relationship Remix, SAPAC 
has been working with Recre-
ational Sports to create a poster 
campaign to appear in facilities 
across campus. These posters 
will “reinforce the fundamentals 
of respect,” including consent.

“We want to be reinforcing 

that healthy relationships are 
a part of an overall wellness,” 
Milkovich said. “So those kinds 
of messaging, specific to the 
ways that students engage in 
sports on our campus ... is an 
example of those targeted kinds 
of education efforts that need to 
complement the big-scale work 
that we’re doing. And all of that 
has to happen on many different 
levels.”

As in previous interviews, the 

administrators present empha-
sized that sexual misconduct 
has become a community prob-
lem — one that will require a 
cultural shift on the part of the 
students and not only through 
new policies.

“Anything that involves 20 

or 30 percent of a population, 
that’s not a rare event — this is 
everyday life, this is culture,” 
Schlissel said. “And that high-
lights for me that the University 
isn’t going to be able to solve 
this problem without the stu-
dents stepping up and working 
with us to solve the problem, 
because it’s the student culture 
that is supporting or allowing 
this milieu to exist. We’ll only 
be successful if we find ways for 
University leaders to work with 
students and students leaders 
and also the broader student 
community on solutions.”

“I’ve made much less of a 

big deal about the difference 
between 
Michigan’s 
num-

bers and the average of this 
larger group simply because 
the average of the larger group 
is unacceptable,” he added. 
“Regardless of what the num-
ber is, it requires our maximum 
attention, because it’s unrea-
sonable.”

Schlissel 
also 
noted 
that 

despite high rates of sexual mis-
conduct, the rate of people who 
who reported feeling unsafe 
on campus is relatively low — 
a seeming contradiction that 
Dean of Students Laura Blake 
Jones said the University is 
struggling to mitigate.

“I know that at the University 

of Michigan, we are a national 
leader in prevention work and 
that we’re not just doing the 
minimum of what’s expected of 
us,” Black Jones said. “All of our 
students have very high … num-
bers of participating in multiple 
experiences of prevention, and 
yet our numbers are the way 
they are. For me, that’s the emo-
tional piece … our model is what 
so many campuses are working 
to replicate and do right now, 
and we’ve been doing that and 
sustaining that and our num-
bers are still as bad as they are.”

Milkovich noted that data 

from programs such as Rela-
tionship Remix show that posi-
tive teachings about consent 
and healthy behavior begin to 
“wear off” after about a year.

“More efforts to our students 

across the course of their stu-
dent life span is a frontier that 
we need to figure out how we 
will reach,” she said.

The hope, Blake Jones said, is 

to reach a point where students 

start leading the conversation 
as opposed to having admin-
istrators start it. The Office of 
Student Life has been provid-
ing training for “high-impact” 
groups on campus — including 
ROTC, Greek life, the Michi-
gan Marching Band, student-
athletes and club-sport athletes 
— with the hope that their col-
lective visibility and influence 
will allow them to lead the rest 
of the student community in 
promoting each other’s wellbe-
ing and preventing, among other 
behaviors, sexual misconduct.

Blake Jones said the Univer-

sity is alone among other Divi-
sion 1 institutions in requiring 
every member of every team — 
including athletes, coaches and 
assistant coaches — to take sex-
ual misconduct training.

“The takeaway ending mes-

sages to students in the train-
ing is that if the campus climate 
is really going to change … it’s 
going to be the actions of not 
the dean of students sitting in 
the Michigan Union, or SAPAC 
ardently doing their work, but 
the people who have been inside 
these programs living and prac-
ticing the skills and interrupt-
ing situations of potential harm 
before they escalate,” Blake 
Jones said.

Shifting the responsibility to 

students, it seems, may play a 
big role moving forward — espe-
cially, as Axinn noted, when 
“these data are as far from per-
fect as data can be.”

“You are all adults,” Schlissel 

said. “This is the way your com-
munity is treating one another, 
so think about that. We have to 
think about that together and try 
to solve this issue together.”

Steven Pachman, an attorney at 

Montgomery McCracken Walker 
& Rhoads LLP who specializes 
in sports-related cases, discussed 
the legal and clinical challenges 
that schools, coaches and train-
ers encounter when faced with a 
sports injury. Many of these cases, 
he noted, end in settlements total-
ing millions of dollars.

“The problem is that experts 

still have vastly competing views 
on what constitutes proper stan-
dard care,” he said. “A big issue is 
also lack of documentation — if it’s 
not documented, it didn’t happen.”

Pachman also noted that pic-

tures of injured students create 
compelling narratives for juries, 
causing difficulties for athletic pro-
grams facing litigation. 

“At the end of the day the health 

and safety of the athlete always 
comes first,” he said. “But athletic 
programs do need to make sure 
they’re up to date with documenta-
tion and management protocols for 
legal issues.”

Broglio’s studies have looked 

into issues related to when athletes 
return to play after a concussion, 
concussion epidemiology and the 
history of concussions.

Currently, every student-athlete 

on campus has the option to enroll 
in an ongoing study on the long-
term symptoms of concussions. 
They receive baseline evaluations 
and re-evaluations every year.

“We’re really trying to demon-

strate how often the injury occurs, 
what the long-term effects are, 
things that confound,” Broglio said. 
“We want to just put some facts 
out there and dispel some of the 
rumors floating around.”

W

ednesday 
evening, 

when I grabbed my tallit 
and walked down Hill 

street 
toward 

Hillel for Yom 
Kippur services, 
nobody 
asked 

if I was Jewish. 
I fit right in — 
I 
knew 
when 

to bow during 
the 
Shema 
(a 

prayer 
calling 

out to God) and 
the 
inflections 

of the v’ahavta 
(a 
prayer 

reminding us of certain Jewish 
practices). I knew how to be 
humble when asking God for 
forgiveness and the strength to be 
a better person, a better Jew. The 
vulnerability that crept into my 
chest as I acknowledged my flaws 
and screw-ups throughout the past 
year was heart wrenching, but 
familiar. This Yom Kippur, nobody 
doubted my faith. 

Although I don’t go to Hillel near-

ly as often as I should, I identify as 
a Jewish American. I grew up very 
much in the faith — my sisters and I 
kept kosher, went to services regu-
larly, became B’not Mitzvah — and 
I’m increasingly embracing my Jew-
ishness. I love belonging to a minor-
ity with a success story — one that 
overcame prejudice and persecution 
to settle as respected middle- and 
upper-class citizens. I’m proud of 
our historical narrative and how we 
used our position as societal “others” 
to advocate for the oppressed, espe-
cially during the Civil Rights Move-
ment. We remember that we were 
once slaves in the land of Egypt.

This is the element of Judaism 

that I most identify with. The Jew-
ish notion of tikkun olam, or heal-
ing the world, comprises my core. 
It shapes my passions and pursuits 
and is part of the reason I love public 

policy so much. Maybe it’s idealistic, 
but I see policy as a tool to repair 
poverty and inequality to make our 
country more just. The summer 
after my sophomore year, I interned 
at a Jewish social justice nonprofit, 
advocating for Voting Rights Act 
reform to ensure people of color 
throughout the South could exercise 
their right to vote. I found the work 
so fulfilling because it was connect-
ed to the abstract ideal of justice that 
I embody in my Jewish being. 

And yet, since I first started liv-

ing in Ann Arbor three years ago, 
my Jewish identity has come under 
dual scrutiny from both Jews and 
non-Jews. I’ve found that some 
gentiles have a hard time reconcil-
ing my faith with my appearance. 
When kids found out I was Jew-
ish my freshman year, I was often 
greeted 
with 
raised 
eyebrows. 

“Wait, really?” they would say, 
utterly shocked. “But you don’t look 
it at all!”

Of course, this reaction is more 

innocent ignorance than malicious 
prejudice, but it still stings. Yes, I’ll 
admit that I don’t possess many of 
the traits some people expect Jews 
to have — my hair is light brown 
and I have my mother’s slim nose 
and green eyes. I’m from Maryland, 
not Westchester, Long Island or Los 
Angeles. But the fact that some peo-
ple don’t realize that it’s offensive to 
openly act surprised when a mem-
ber of an ethnicity breaks away from 
an offensive stereotype is beyond 
me. What was even more offensive 
was when one girl, after discovering 
I was Jewish, cocked her head to the 
side and said, “Yeah, I guess I see it.”

But these superficial encounters 

aren’t the ones that fundamentally 
upset me. In fact, they feel more 
like dirt in an open wound. The 
real gut-punching is when people of 
my own community and faith don’t 
recognize me as one of them. It’s 
when a hand shoots up behind me 

two weeks ago during the first day 
of a Judaic studies class and tells 
me directly that to be Jewish, my 
mother must be Jewish, too, openly 
contradicting me and my faith in 
front of the entire class. Plain and 
simple, he says. It’s from the Torah.

My mother is Catholic, which, 

according to certain Jewish doc-
trine, invalidates my Jewish iden-
tity. This doctrine, however, is not 
actually from the Torah and instead 
is merely a practice passed down 
from ancient Roman times. Even 
though my sisters and I had mikva’ot 
(conversion ceremonies) when we 
were babies, the ceremony wasn’t 
Orthodox. As a result, neither the 
state of Israel nor the kid behind me 
recognizes me as Jew. And it hurts.

This doubt stings more than the 

ignorant stereotypes because, com-
ing from within my own group, it’s 
harder to dismiss. The matrilineal 
teaching is not some fringe, ultra-
Orthodox belief. Though not present 
in the Torah, the teaching is widely 
accepted, and part of being Jewish is 
feeling connected to the patchwork 
of practices and traditions that form 
our dogma. This tradition, how-
ever, makes me feel alienated, like 
an outsider in my own faith. I find it 
perplexing to encounter Jews who 
feel like they can and should reject 
me for not corresponding with an 
arcane definition, especially during 
a time of shrinking numbers and 
dwindling faith.

The fact that I don’t fit neatly 

into my community is something 
I’m learning to digest. For now, I’ll 
continue to embrace the elements of 
Judaism that speak to me: the empha-
sis on progress, social justice and the 
duty to make the world a better place. 
And in doing so, I vow to push the 
community’s stubborn boundaries 
by creating my own space.

N

ever before had a pope entered the 
House chamber, much less been 
given the freedom to address those 

who run the most pow-
erful nation. But there, 
perhaps, has never been 
a pope in our lifetime 
as enthralling as Pope 
Francis. More than 20 
years after U.S. Rep. John 
Boehner (R–Ohio) tried 
to invite Pope John Paul 
II to the chamber and 
was declined by both him 
and later Benedict XVI, 
Francis, the first pope in 
history from the Ameri-
cas, finally accepted Boehner’s invitation.

As with anything congressional, politics 

ruled everything about the pope’s visit, even 
before he arrived in the nation. Though he is 
the pope Boehner brought, Democratic presi-
dential candidate Bernie Sanders claimed to 
be his ideological equal, and Rep. Paul Gosar 
(R–Ariz.) boycotted. Few figures are equally 
applauded and criticized by both sides of 
the aisle as Francis is. His approval rating 
was as high as 76 percent during 2014, with 
high approval from conservatives and lib-
erals alike. Both sides could, in theory, pick 
and choose issues on which they claim to 
be in line with the views of the Vatican, but 
2015 has seen approval ratings in all groups 
decline. Approval among conservatives is 
down to 45 percent, no doubt in part due to 
the fallout from Francis’ encyclical, or letter 
of Catholic doctrine, Laudato si’, on climate 
change. Approval among liberals has also 
fallen 14 percent, perhaps because time has 
shown Francis to not always be the progres-
sive media darling he was often portrayed as 
early in his papacy.

That said, playing the polls and partisan 

politics of both the pope and his address 
instead of recognizing the overarching 
themes he continued to stress would miss 
all of the papal purposes. Pope Francis is not 
playing the side of Republican or Democrat. 
It’s impossible to categorize the issues into 
the polarized bipartisan system of Duverg-
er’s law. Never mind that the pope’s com-
ments prior to his speech are global and not 
American in nature, or that this was the sec-
ond speech he had ever given in English. It 
was a speech that was neither liberal nor con-
servative, but Catholic.

In many ways, the lead-up and response to 

the speech was similar to the release of the 
Laudato si’. For months, media speculated 
about how the Vatican, notably opposed to 
certain circles of conservative Christianity 
in both its acceptance and encouragement 
of understanding modern science principles 
such as evolution and climatology, would 
blast climate-change deniers. And while 
the encyclical certainly did align itself with 

scientists and environmentalists calling for 
action to prevent further climate change, 
the point was again missed, as Francis once 
noted that the encyclical was not really even 
primarily about environmentalism. In it, he 
wrote, “The Church does not presume to set-
tle scientific questions or to replace politics,” 
knowing that the two would take the main 
stage in discussion, but behind all of it were 
major themes of responsibility to protect the 
marginalized and care for the poor, as well as 
a call to end the indifference toward a throw-
away culture that extends far beyond envi-
ronmental concerns.

Far more than Francis pushed political 

solutions, he urged Congress to continue to 
strive for the “common good.” The common 
good, as outlined in the church’s 1965 docu-
ment Gaudium et spes, is “the sum total of 
social conditions which allow people, either 
as groups or as individuals, to reach their 
fulfillment more fully and more easily.” This 
concept is intrinsically tied to those respon-
sible for guiding nations, with whom much 
responsibility rests. As Francis noted, “poli-
tics is … an expression of our compelling need 
to live as one, in order to build as one, the 
greatest common good.”

As more and more citizens feel like Con-

gress is out of touch and a servant to special 
interests, the belief that politicians continue 
to promote the “general welfare” in order to 
build a more perfect union, as noted in the 
preamble of the Constitution, has waned 
with it. Francis opened his speech comparing 
the legislators to the figure of Moses and the 
tales of him leading the Israelites, telling his 
audience, “You are asked to protect, by means 
of the law, the image and likeness fashioned 
by God on every human face.” The number 
of citizens who would agree that Congress is 
fulfilling this duty, especially in serving the 
faces of the marginalized instead of the faces 
of the powerful, dwindles each day.

There’s no greater picture than that of Fran-

cis eating lunch with the homeless instead of 
with his hosts from Congress after his speech. 
He’s not interested in the rhetoric; he’s inter-
ested in the parable. Instead of only looking 
down and out at the world from the halls of 
Congress and the political elite, he put himself 
among those who come last, for the last will 
be first. Francis did nothing more than ask for 
dialogue on the issues that keep us from mov-
ing toward this common good — a dialogue 
that remembers those outside of the House 
chamber who need help the most.

In an address the day before to many 

American bishops, Francis told the leaders 
of the Church in America to “be pastors close 
to people, pastors who are neighbors and ser-
vants.” Perhaps that’s a fitting message for 
the leaders in the capitol as well.

Creating my own space

DAVID 
HARRIS

I don’t need to have kids
I

t all started with population growth.
During my first semester of freshman 
year, I took a class called Global Change. 

It was, in short, a lengthy 
and depressing list of 
all the ways humans are 
severely fucking up the 
planet. It was also life 
changing, and it became 
the reason why I chose to 
study environmental sci-
ence. One of the points I 
took away from this class 
was that the world’s popu-
lation is getting so large, 
so quickly, that many of 
the sustainable changes 
that we, as humans from all over the world, 
have implemented are simply overridden by 
the negative effects of adding so many people 
to the planet every year. So in that class, as 
an 18-year-old freshman, I made the decision 
that I would not contribute to this problem. 
I would not have kids. Instead, I could adopt 
one. Or two or three, even. It was a win-win 
situation for everyone, and I’d save the world, 
etc., etc.

Then, about a year ago, my life suddenly 

changed forever. I’m still not sure how, but 
somehow I came to the shocking revelation 
that I, in fact, am not required to have children. 
Let me reiterate: It took me 20 years to realize 
I didn’t have to have kids. That might seem like 
a very obvious thing to you, especially if you 
are not a woman, but as ridiculous as it seems, 
I’m actually not surprised it took me that long. 
You see, we’re so trained as women to see our 
lives played out as follows: get a degree, get a 
job, get married, work for a while, have some 
babies, either do or don’t give up work and 

be a loving mom for the rest of your life. I’ve 
lived my entire life planning on including the 
mom part — I’ve even spent time brainstorm-
ing my future children’s names (which I won’t 
tell you, because if they ever exist, their names 
will be way more unique than “Rachael,” dam-
mit). But now when I think about that sto-
ryline — the one with babies — it seems like 
someone else’s story.

The more I thought about this crazy revela-

tion, the more it made sense. I was excited. I 
was liberated from something I’d never actu-
ally faced. But that didn’t matter; I didn’t real-
ize how trapped I had felt until I let myself out 
of the cage. I’ve never been good with kids. 
Children seriously freak me out. They make 
me nervous, and I don’t know how on Earth 
you’re supposed to actually make them listen 
to you without bribing them with chocolate, 
cake or Legos (all very effective tactics on me). 
And babies? Any time I hold one, all I feel is 
terror that I’m going to somehow drop it, and 
all I want is for someone to take it back as soon 
as possible.

I used to think that I wanted kids so I could 

get right all the things my parents got wrong. I 
even had a kind of mental list of things I would 
do differently than them. For example, if I had 
a daughter, she would be allowed to yell at me 
when she was angry. Great idea, 12-year-old 
Rachael. I thought I had this parenting thing 
figured out.

But even if I did get right everything my 

parents got wrong, there’s a pretty good 
chance I’d also get wrong all the things they 
got right. There’s not really a practice test you 
can take for this stuff.

Whenever I tell people that I don’t want 

kids, without fail the response is, “That’s 
what you say now.” It’s so completely foreign

and don’t worry, all you child-loving 
people out there, I’m not a complete 
monster. At one point I did want 
kids. Yes, I still might change my 
mind, and no, that statement is not 
simply to comfort you or to assuage 
your fears; it is just me recognizing 
my freedom. And no, my “freedom” 
is not just laziness, apprehension or 
“You’re just an ignorant young per-
son who has no idea what’s good for 

her.” It’s my body and it’s my life, and 
surprisingly enough, it’s my choice. 
It’s not that I’ve made up my mind 
100 percent to never have children. 
It’s that I know that I don’t have to. 
And wow, that is liberating.

Instead, I can travel. I can baby-

sit other people’s kids and then 
promptly return them. I can give 
my friends and family all that extra 
love inside of me. Or I can give it to 

cats. I can save money — a whole lot 
of money. I don’t have to have the 
ridiculously huge responsibility of 
literally creating a person. Now my 
only issue is finding a husband who 
also doesn’t want kids.

Oh, wait. I don’t need to have one 

of those, either.

‘Executioner’ not 
so well executed

New FX series 

pushes the 
boundaries 

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts WRiter

This article contains spoilers for 

the finale of “Sons of Anarchy.” 

Kurt Sutter, for better or worse, 

has 
become 

a go-to guy 
for FX. Ever 
since 
his 

involvement 
as a writer 
and eventual 
producer for 
Shawn Ryan’s 
“The Shield,” 
Sutter has risen in prominence 
among the network with “Sons 
of Anarchy,” which became one 
of FX’s most popular series at the 
time of its finale in 2014.

Now, in 2015, Sutter continues 

to call FX home with his newest 
series, “The Bastard Executioner,” 
a show that continues the usual 
themes that dominate his earlier 
work while displaying some of the 
showrunner’s biggest flaws.

At the core of Sutter’s creations 

is violence. His worlds are nasty 
and brutal, forming a cycle of suf-
fering and despair that few can 
escape. In “Sons of Anarchy,” Jax 
Teller fought for seven seasons to 
end the savagery around SAM-
CRO, only to be sucked into its 
black hole of barbarity, with death 
being the only salvation for the 
troubled biker.

This idea echoes within “The 

Bastard Executioner” through the 
story of medieval warrior Wilkin 
Brattle (Lee Jones, “Home and 

Away”). Opening with a flashback, 
Brattle lies wounded on the battle-
field when a vision of a child tells 
him to “Lay down the sword” and 
“Live the life of a different man.”

Brattle, still haunted by visions 

of his tormented past, takes the 
words to heart and settles in Wales 
with his wife Petra (Elen Rhys, 
“World War Z”). Living in a time 
of political upheaval and rebel-
lion against the power of England, 
Brattle finds his promise hard to 
keep as, armed with a club instead 
of a sword, he assists the local reb-
els in their guerilla resistance.

One of the biggest issues “Sons 

of Anarchy” experienced during 
its extended run was the general 
expansion of its storyline and sub-
plots into an unruly and bloated 
beast. This issue carries over to 
“The Bastard Executioner” as 
the weight of the narrative nearly 
crushes 
the 
premiere. 
Clock-

ing in at just over 90 minutes, the 
premiere takes a long time intro-
ducing its huge cast of main and 
supporting characters, with sev-
eral killed off within the same epi-
sode. It’s unfortunate because the 
ensemble is impressive, but there’s 
not really enough time for most of 
them to forge an initial connection 
to the audience.

Not until 40 minutes into the 

pilot, when villains Baron Ventris 
(Brían F. O’Byrne, “Aquarius”) and 
Milus Corbett (Stephen Moyer, 
“True Blood”) order the massacre 
of Brattle’s village, does the narra-
tive truly pick up.

The village massacre is just one 

of many sequences of extended 
violence, but it is definitely the 
most disturbing as mostly women 
and children, including the preg-
nant Petra, are slaughtered in 
the dark, and orange flames shed 

light on the atrocity. Sutter never 
shies away from viciousness, but 
it sometimes seems a little much, 
as if he wants to show how many 
different ways a person can be 
stabbed in one episode.

Under the direction of Paris 

Barclay, director of 15 “Sons of 
Anarchy” episodes, most of these 
scenes work on a basic level. Brat-
tle’s vengeful ambush of Ventris 
in a hayfield is a highlight of the 
pilot, if only for the appearance of 
“The Americans” ’s Matthew Rhys 
as a Welsh rebel leader. However, 
there are missteps. The choice of 
an electric guitar to orchestrate 
the village massacre feels tonally 
unwelcome, and the opening flash-
back displays some color over-sat-
uration that makes the scene feel 
somewhat cheap.

It’s funny that the show is 

called, “The Bastard Executioner,” 
but Brattle, under the urgings of 
the mysterious and manipulative 
healer, Annora (“Sons of Anarchy” 
alum Katey Sagal), doesn’t truly 
assume the title position until 
more than an hour has passed, 
when he takes the identity of the 
deceased executioner, Maddox 
(Felix Scott, “The Interceptor”)

In that fact lies “The Bastard 

Executioner” ’s biggest issue — 
inside this swollen premiere are 
decent foundations for a series. 
Brattle’s first execution is a well-
done moment of choice, merg-
ing the show’s past and present 
through the man’s visions. Unfor-
tunately, the show is so extrane-
ously dense that it takes far too 
long to get to this point. Sutter 
needs to cast aside this unneces-
sary baggage present in the pilot 
and cut to the heart of the new 
series if he hopes to bring contin-
ued success to FX.

TV REVIEW
New ‘Who’ revives 
old doctor’s panache

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

The Doctor is in the building 

and he brought horrible puns 
and an electric guitar. Were you 
expecting 
someone 
else?

It’s 
quite 

a hard thing 
to 
review 

“Doctor 
Who” 
because 
no 

matter what 
you think of 
it, someone, 
somewhere 
will disagree with everything you 
have ever stood for. Some folks 
stopped watching after William 
Hartnell’s First Doctor (like, you 
know, your grandparents), while 
others have only ever seen Matt 
Smith’s Eleven.

The current era has been 

met with controversy (to say 
the least), namely directed at 
show-runner 
Steven 
Moffat 

(“Sherlock”) and his inability 
to bring more diversity to the 
Who Universe. I personally 
agree with this sentiment, yet 

I still respect the ineluctable 
contribution Moffat has made 
to taking The Doctor out of 
your parent’s basement and into 
the hearts of the entire world. 
I also have to say that I love 
Peter Capaldi’s Doctor. Believe 
it or not, Moffat is way more 
attuned to the original vision of 
the Doctor than most fans wish 
to admit. In his first adventures, 
the Doctor was shrewd, rude 
and a little impatient with his 
human companions. He was, in 
short, a grumpy old man who 
had just about had it up to here 
with the universe, and he didn’t 
care who he forced to listen. 
Clearly, this is the iteration 
of the Doctor Moffat feels the 
most connected to, and it’s one 
I prefer to Matt Smith’s quirky, 
bouncy ball of fun. Moffat, 
someone who gets a bad rep 
for making “Doctor Who” a tad 
too serious, still knows how to 
fill his odd-ball time-lord with 
lovable idiosyncrasies, this time 
an electric guitar and sunglasses 
in 1198 A.D. England.

Like 
many 
of 
Moffat’s 

adventures 
into 
the 
Who 

Universe, 
the 
season 
nine 

premiere, 
“The 
Magician’s 

Apprentice,” treats the canon 
and mythology of the Doctor 
like a giant sandbox filled 
with previously unanswered 
(and sometimes unanswerable) 
questions. 
“The 
Magician’s 

Apprentice” continues in the 
vein of “Into the Dalek” (a 
personal 
favorite 
of 
mine) 

by 
exploring 
the 
creation, 

psychology and circumstances 
behind a species of absolute 
evil, the Daleks. Moffat’s ideas 
are often so insane, yet obvious, 
you feel yourself always asking 
why no one has ever thought of 
doing it before.

In this case, we explore the 

exact relationship the Doctor 
has with Davros, the inventor 
of the Daleks. There’s more 

A

than a little “Harry Potter” 
vibe to this episode, as Davros’s 
serpentine servants abduct the 
Doctor, Clara (Jenna Louise 
Coleman, “Captain America: 
The First Avenger”) and the 
Master (Michelle Gomez, “The 
Brink”). The trio are brought to 
Davros’s homeworld of Skaro 
so that the Doctor may speak 
with the inventor before he 
dies … or so it seems.

The episode ends on a “To 

Be 
Continued” 
card 
which 

will undoubtedly anger those 
who have dismissed the more 

serialized format “Doctor Who” 
has taken on at the helm of 
Moffat. The format feels more 
like serialized prose or stories, 
like that of Dickens and other 
authors of Victorian serials.

The one thing I’m uncertain 

about the new season is the 
direction of the Master as a 
possible 
anti-hero. 
Moffat 

makes 
it 
clear 
with 
the 

Master’s murder of the agents 
that this is still the Master and 
should not be trusted, but I still 
don’t believe that the entire 
millennia of conflict between 

the Master and the Doctor was 
just “flirting.” That being said, 
the show does do a great deal 
in contextualizing the Doctor’s 
hatred of the Master with his 
hatred of Davros. The Master 
is still a Time Lord / Lady, and 
there’s definitely a familiarity 
there, even if the show presents 
it as more intimate than some 
fans might be comfortable 
with. With Davros, the biggest 
thing the Doctor can relate to 
is the fact that they have both 
done horrible things which 
they self-justify.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Oh, Fetty Wap, won’t 
you come my way? 

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

The year is 1738. Many people 

are plagued with smallpox or 
other legitimate, more pressing 
problems (FOMO on the birth 
of King George III?) — but me, 
myself? I’m stricken with Fetty 
Wap fever.

Before we get down to it, 

there’s one thing you should 
know: hip hop is not my 
preferred genre. This just in — 
white girl from cushy Michigan 
suburb not the world’s biggest 
fan of rap music. More at 11.

It’s no secret, and it’s no 

surprise. David Bowie gets me 
going, as do Sarah Vaughan, 
Elliott Smith and The Kinks. 
Of course, as a music writer, I 
pride myself on listening to a 
myriad — by the truest sense 
of the word — of genres. Jazz, 
R&B, neo-soul, pop-y pop, folk, 
etc. (Admittedly, Johnny Cash 
is about as far as I’ll go into 
country. Maybe Shania Twain if 
I’m feeling frisky.) But dabbling 
in hip hop is not exactly 
the most relaxing listening 
adventure for me. I love it; I 
appreciate it. I could rap “The 
Real Slim Shady” to you right 
now, in its entirety, and have a 
damn good time doing it. But 
it’s just not the butter to my 
bread. Given the choice, I’d pick 
Marvin Gaye over Kan-yeezy 
almost every time.

Lately, though, I’ve been 

walking around campus sans 
any 
typical 
tunes 
beating 

through my head. “679” by 
Fetty Wap and Remy Boyz has 
taken over. Stepping out of my 
dorm (“… and I got this sewed 
up”), riding down the elevator 
(“Remy Boyz, they know us”), 
eating a bagel (“all fast money, 
no slow bucks”), walking to 
class (“no one can control us”) 
and sitting down in lecture (“ay, 
yeeEEEAaah baby”). It won’t 
leave me, no matter how hard 
I try.

Mr. 
Wap, 
born 
Willie 

Maxwell in 1991, is a fascinating 
creature. He catapulted into 
the spotlight this summer with 
the melodically minimalistic 
smash “Trap Queen,” a strange 
song upon closer examination. 
There are about five notes sung 
throughout the whole thing 
(same three in the verses, same 
two in the chorus, excluding 
the rap), and pixie-like, staccato 
synths 
run 
rampant. 
It’s 

appealing from the get-go but 
ultimately lacks variety —not 

exactly what you’d call “chart 
bait” in a day and age where 
constant shock-factor is needed 
to hold a listener’s attention. To 
boot, it introduced the world 
to that signature Wap vibrato 
we now love/hate: “… getting 
fly with my baby, yeEEEAaah.” 
Never has a goat in heat 
yodeling about his boo thang 
sounded so hot.

Since then, my beloved “679” 

and “My Way,” which features a 
perfect verse from Drake, have 
secured Wap’s place in pop 
music’s vocabulary. Plus his 
debut album is set to come out 
on Sept. 25. Most importantly, 
though, people listen to Fetty 
Wap. Whether it’s ironic or 
not, “I’m like hey, what’s up, 
hello” has worked its way into 
Instagram captions worldwide.

Speaking of irony: this could 

be debated, but quite a few 
listeners dig Wap because they 
think he’s hilarious. Almost 
everyone 
with 
whom 
I’ve 

discussed mentions his one 
eye and bursts out laughing 
(glaucoma stole the other from 
us, may it rest), and my friend 
often tries to mimic his weirdly 
strained 
singing. 
Also, 
his 

music isn’t really respected in 
the way, say, Kendrick Lamar’s 
is. As of late, hip hop has 
become a platform for artists 
like Lamar to convey heavier 
subject 
matter, 
i.e. 
their 

dissatisfaction 
with 
police 

brutality, 
the 
implications 

of and stereotypes involved 
with being a famous African 

American man, etc. Fetty Wap 
raps about squadding up and 
chillin’ with his girl. Even 
newcomer 
and 
surprising 

tickler-of-my-fancy 
Vince 

Staples talks about his girl on 
“Lemme Know,” but since he’s 
less mainstream — and perhaps 
a bit more lyrically deft — the 
music seems less trivial.

OK. That’s all peachy. But I 

still can’t sweat out my Fetty 
Wap fever. Even though he’s 
“trivial” and Cyclop-tic and 
repetitive and odd, I still enjoy 
listening to Fetty Wap.

The key word there is “enjoy.” 

Just because an artist isn’t as 
intellectual, as critically adored 
as one of his contemporaries 
doesn’t mean he isn’t successful 
at his job. Wap resonates with 
the masses arguably better 
than any other pop and hip-hop 
artist out there right now — and 
he does so in a deeply enjoyable 
way. And though the word is 
grossly overused, his music is 
fun, above all else. He makes 
me dance like an inebriated 
aunt at a wedding, sing along 
obnoxiously and laugh at the 
absurdity of it all. I can’t say 
that for many other current 
musicians. In my fevered past 
week, I’ve loved nothing more 
than putting the fun back into 
my life and my playlists amid 
swirls of homework and new 
classes.

This is college, after all. 

Sometimes I don’t want to 
think. I just want to party like 
it’s 1738.

300 ENTERTAINMENT

Everybody wants to be Fetty Wap.

Ryan Adams covers 
Taylor Swift’s ‘1989’

PAX AM

Does my hair look like Taylor Swift?

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

Ryan Adams really takes Taylor 

Swift seriously.

Swift’s 
infectious, 
critically 

beloved 1989 is 
a pop triumph, 
so 
Adams’s 

choice to cover 
the album in its 
entirety seems 
a little baffling 
at first. But then 
again, 
this 
is 

Ryan 
Adams. 

He has recorded 
15 albums in as many years, not 
including many unreleased ones 
(a track-by-track cover of The 
Strokes’s Is This It among them). 
This is Ryan Adams, recently 
divorced and newly heartbroken, 
who wants to shed some teardrops 
on his guitar and reach out to Tay-
lor Swift for inspiration as so many 
of us do.

1989, then, is a logical choice for 

Adams’s cathartic breakup album. 
It’s Swift’s most cheerful album by 
a long shot, but even in her “Shake 
It Off” bubblegum, Swift shows 
echoes of the heartache and regret 
that led her to the dancefloor in the 
first place. In retreading her emo-
tional steps and appropriating her 
words to fit his own voice, Adams 
is recording the ultimate love let-
ter to Swift and the power of her 
lyricism.

If only Adams had done more 

with the material. I’m not sure 
anyone would point to the lyrics on 
1989 as a pillar of Great American 
Songwriting (“His hands are in my 

hair / His clothes are in my room”), 
but Swift covers a great deal of 
emotional bases with a diverse col-
lection of retro-inspired pop beats. 
Adams keeps his covers simple, 
often using only acoustic guitars 
to accompany his driving voice. 
Sometimes, as in the standout 
“Out of the Woods,” the plainness 
of his arrangements scrubs the 
music of any pretense and allows 
the listener to bathe in his begging, 
crying timbre. Much of the time, 
though, Adams drowns in his 
own sadness and self-pity, losing 
sight of the emotion that makes his 
other tracks so strong. “This Love” 
is a drag of a song, lasting nearly 
five minutes with nothing to offer 
except a few repeating piano notes 
and vocals that sound like Adams 
is doing his best impression of a 
sleepy Bono. The bad and boring 
far outweigh the album’s innova-
tive material, which is a shame, 
because Adams attempts some 
radical style on this record.

While 1989’s simplicity is its 

downfall, the more experimen-
tal tracks are where Adams truly 
shines. “Style” is a messy cluster-
fuck of a song, but upon a second 
listen, his sonic influences become 
more clear. The jabbing energy 
of the guitars is reminiscent of 
’80s-era Sonic Youth (Adams 
also makes a lyrical shout-out to 
that “Daydream Nation look in 
your eye”). Before he released the 
album, Adams noted that he was 
attempting to cover 1989 in the 
style of Bruce Springsteen and The 
Smiths. When he really leans into 
his inspiration, as on the album’s 
opener, “Welcome to New York,” 

Adams’s experimentation pays off 
with some interesting sounds he 
hasn’t utilized in his discography 
to date.

Despite the tributes galore, 

Adams imbues most every song 
with his signature alt-country 
sensibility. Even the sparse and 
depressive “Blank Space” is imme-
diately recognizable as a Ryan 
Adams song; I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if, at this very moment, one 
of Adams’s many cool-dad fans is 
queuing up this album for a drive 
upstate, and doesn’t realize until 
“Bad Blood” that the lyrics are 
actually Taylor Swift. Adams puts 
a lot of faith in those lyrics he’s 
borrowing from Swift — the cover 
album operates on the meaning 
and merit of those words on their 
own, the fact that he can change 
the arrangement and strip down 
the beats to a few guitars and the 
essential Taylor Swift feelings will 
still be there to drive the album to 
its hopeful close.

Adams’s faith in the timeless-

ness of these songs is sometimes 
bizarre. He attempts to pass 
“Shake It Off” as an ode to late-
night desperation and white boy 
sadness, which is absolutely ridic-
ulous considering that the lyrics 
are all about dancing and having 
fun. But some of these songs legiti-
mately work in a weird, raw and 
compelling way. He’s serious, com-
pletely committing to feeling the 
way he does, accepting the imper-
fections of how it all turns out on 
playback. Through its highs and 
lows, 1989 sifts through Adams’s 
broken-up psyche, one acoustic 
guitar and Taylor lyric at a time.

TV REVIEW

‘Rosewood’ brings 
standard cop tropes

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Fox’s new “Rosewood” feels 

like a compilation of plot devices 
and characters and dialogue from 
every other cop 
or crime show 
on 
television 

right now (or, 
really, 
ever) 

and leaves you 
unsure 
even 

after forty min-
utes 
whether 

they’re 
going 

for light com-
edy or drama 
with some depth. It’s not even 
a combination of the two — it’s 
just ambiguous. And though the 
show is funny at times, overall it 
doesn’t really work.

Dr. Rosewood ( Morris Chest-

nut, “Nurse Jackie”) is confident 
to the point of being cocky, but 
he hasearned the right, as the 
best pathologist in Miami. The 
pilot begins with him running 
— literally — into what looks 
like a grisly murder case. Very 
“CSI Miami,” except Rosewood 
cracks the case within two min-
utes instead of 45, irritating the 
guy who is supposed to be solving 
the crime. We then learn he runs 
his own pathology lab with his 
sister and his sister’s fiance, and 
they do private consultations on 
cases. The plot begins to pick up 
when his mother (Lorraine Tous-
saint (“Orange is the New Black”) 

comes to ask him for a personal 
favor in the form of a second 
opinion on the case of her former 
student. It had been deemed as an 
accidental death, but she feels it 
was something more sinister.

Unfortunately, the writers buy 

into the idea that we wouldn’t 
possibly keep watching their 
show unless there’s a possibil-
ity of a sex scene sometime in 
the not so distant future. Rose-
wood checks into it, discover-
ing that the case is in fact more 
than it looked at first glance, and 
learning that the new homicide 
detective from New York, Annal-
ise Villa (Jaina Lee Ortiz, “The 
After”) isn’t as impressed by 
him as he is. In order to solve the 
case — and obviously, catch the 
bad guy — the two have to work 
together, which is more than fine 
by Rosewood. It doesn’t take too 
long for Villa to warm up to him 
enough to keep him clued in, but 
he still irritates her the majority 
of their time together. “It’s unde-
niable — we make a great team,” 
he smirks, after setting some 
guy’s nose that Villa just broke. 
The sexual tension between 
Rosewood and Villa is stale. It’s 
too obvious and overdone.

“Rosewood” brings the same 

kind of humor to a mystery crime 
that USA’s “Psych” did, which 
makes sense as it is the brain-
child of Todd Harthan, who also 
worked on “Psych.” But Rose-
wood goes a little deeper than 
“Pysch” ever did. It feels like the 

writers are trying to show more 
respect for dead people than 
the usual procedurals that use 
glimpses of mangled bodies in 
the first or last five minutes of a 
show as a plot driver — especially 
with a couple almost teary lines 
delivered seriously by Toussaint, 
who doesn’t get as much screen-
time as she should. This may also 
be because both Rosewood and 
Villa have complicated relation-
ships with the concept and con-
sequences of death — especially 
the kind that you can’t see com-
ing, and can’t solve.

For a show that’s supposed 

to feel like easy viewing, this 
dichotomy between trying to be 
thoughtful about life and hav-
ing every other line be a cute 
little quip doesn’t work. It makes 
you laugh, but only because the 
humor in it is so familiar.

Like 
“Minority 
Report,” 

another new show on Fox, 
“Rosewood”’s main characters 
are people of color, and one 
of them has a lesbian fiance 
(which is worth pointing out 
as there is still a lack of shows 
featuring main characters who 
are anything other than het-
erosexual). So at least there, 
Fox is making some great deci-
sions. Though I do wish these 
shows would stop having even 
their women characters insult 
male criminals by calling them 
“scared little bitches” — but I 
guess Fox thinks we really can’t 
have it all.

ALBUM REVIEW

T

hey say you’re likely to 
meet “the one” in col-
lege. And by “they” I 

mean my overzealous relatives, 
the ones who spew not-so-sage 
advice at fam-
ily gatherings 
after throwing 
back one-too-
many glasses 
of wine. How-
ever, in my 
case, they were 
absolutely cor-
rect. Though 
I’m confident 
my kin’s defi-
nitions of “the 
one” differs from the clothing 
companion I’ve grown to adore, 
I’m happy and in love.

In short, the undergraduate 

college experience is a wondrous 
four-year experiment. You’re 
able to truly test your limits, push 
some boundaries and, above all, 
step outside of your sartorial 
comfort zone. For me, a distant 
dream once reserved to the truest 
of trendsetters became a reality 
and a staple of my wardrobe. 

The year was 2014, and the 

romper and I endured an extraor-
dinary love affair and never 
looked back.

What truly captured my heart 

about the romper was its ease; 
similarly to the powerful effects 
of a good coat, I could instantly 
transform from a rundown, slop-
pily dressed college student into a 
somewhat-polished pseudo-adult.

Though the romper is subject 

to endlessly endearing qualities, 
what truly stole my heart was the 
uncanny semblance it bears to my 
pajamas of choice, the infant sta-
ple, the one-piece-wonder that is 
the onesie. Rompers changed the 
game by being a sort of socially 
acceptable pajama-esque garment 
for all occasions other than sleep. 
It was genius. It was everything I 
didn’t know I needed. The hybrid 
of a top and cropped trouser had 
a seductive simplicity. You lit-
erally just slide it on and you’re 
dressed in a full ensemble. That 
right there easily saves you seven 
minutes of dreaded morning out-

fit indecisiveness.

While I’m aware the romper 

reemerged around spring 2011 
after its metallic triteness and 
extended legs of the ’70s, along 
with countless identity crises (i.e. 
often resurfacing during festival 
season as its somewhat washed 
up cousin, overalls), I was ini-
tially a skeptic. As with most 
bourgeoning trends, I assumed it 
would eventually fizzle out, and 
my inherent aversion drew me to 
avoidance. I was naïve, uneasy 
with the concept of abandon-
ing my beloved closet of endless 
separates that structured suffi-
cient portmanteaus. As bloggers 
and trend-forecasters badgered 
us hopeless wannabe style-icon/
internet-trolls with the news, I 
resisted. In my defense, I was a 
long, lanky, clueless high-school 
freshman 
when 
the 
romper 

reemerged — too under-confident 
to rock anything other than my 
trusty, extra-long (thanks be to 
Lulu’s special order) yoga pants.

Yet, 
the 
romper 
persisted 

with a strong social media pres-
ence, immaculate appearances 
on the runway and rave reviews 
of esteemed fashion critics; but I 
regrettably fell victim to the spell 
only as of late. Forgive me, romper, 
for not realizing your true poten-
tial until I fully trusted you. But 
now, here we are, two kindred 
spirits who just needed to mature 
apart before we could grow 
together. 

As with any great love, the 

search wasn’t easy. It was a pains-
taking pursuit.

For starters, rompers are sized 

stranger than any garment I have 
ever come across. You’d think 

they’d be cut similar to the stan-
dard dress size — bust, hips, waist, 
boom — the whole awful, humiliat-
ing, as-if-I-needed-to-be-reduced-
to-yet-another-number shebang. 
But no, it’s absolutely nonsensical 
and against all cloth-cutting logic.

Yet, these offsetting qualities 

seemed a necessary roadblock in 
the attainment of a quasi-nirvana 
level of satisfaction. I knew “the 
one” would never be wholly, one-
hundred-percent perfect. I had 
to assess my options, not merely 
settle for what was there. I knew 
true love was all about the chase 
and the challenge.

My first rendezvous with the 

romper was flawed, awkward 
and uncomfortable. Essential-
ly, it didn’t fit. It didn’t com-
pliment my body, it didn’t play 
off my prominent features and 
again, it was a downright bore.

Like a tragically awful first 

date, it was all wrong. What’s 
worse was that I tried to like 
it. I searched endlessly for its 
redeeming qualities, and by 
the time I counted seven off-
setting attributes, I knew the 
end wasn’t near, it was there.

Though I don’t doubt the 

first romper prompted me to 
test my limits, it was suffocat-
ing in ways I knew would hurt 
us in the long term. But even-
tually, one day when the sun 
shines overhead, or in my case 
the April showers quickly esca-
late into a torrential downpour; 
sometimes, when you least 
expect it, you’re seeking shel-
ter in a department store. You 
glance to your left and there, 
on a mannequin, waiting to be 
ripped off, is the one.

HULU

Am I culturally relevant yet?.

LONDON FASHION WEEK RECAP

 Burberry was the final show 
of this year’s London Fashion 
Week, and they did that role 
justice. Stakes were high for many 
reasons: the star studded front 
row, the national Snapchat story 
and just the simple fact of it being 
Burberry in the heart of London. 
The label could not have done a 
better job of encompassing every 
aspect of what a true fashion 
show is.
 Burberry CEO Christopher 
Bailey, in an interview during the 
show, said explicitly that above all 
else, it was a show. This was done 
in many ways. First, there was the 
unbelievable music. A 32-piece 
orchestra sat in the center of the 
arena playing music for Alison 
Moyet while these models walked 
down the runway wearing the 
latest Burberry looks. Next there 
were stars — everywhere. Cara 
Delevingne sat in the front row 

along with Kate Moss and actor 
Benedict Cumberbatch. But 
the show wasn’t complete until 
world-renowned fashion queen 
Anna Wintour walked in to 
support the show.
 The looks modeled on Monday 
were all impeccable. They 
had different vibes, but all of 
them carried on the traditional 
Burberry feel. Whether it was 
a soft white lace dress or a dark 
black leather jacket, all of the 
pieces were finished delicately 
and simply allowing for the 
typical Burberry class to shine 
through. 
 This show was absolutely 
fantastic. From the music to 
the people in attendance to 
the clothes, Burberry yet again 
proved themselves as an absolute 
powerhouse brand. 

- JULIA DOYLE

 Pringle of Scotland remains an 
anonymous brand to most of us here 
in the States, which comes as such 
a pity considering it has the flare, 
boldness and eccentricity to comete 
with any fashion risk taker. 
 Some of the key looks were embla-
zoned with structured patterns that 
use both shadows and tricks of the 
eye to create a living piece of wear-
able art. The colors were very true 
to the season — many creams, golds 
and whites gave off an ethereal feel 
as models strutted down the runway 
with a summer glow.
 Who said knitwear and crocheted 
patterns were for the winter? Prov-
ing to be a huge trend in the spring 
and summer collections this year, 
Pringle of Scotland was not one to 

hold back with the knitted vibes. 
Showcasing skirts, dresses and a 
tunic or two with the bold pattern — 
there’s nothing wrong with bringing 

a bit of warmth with you during your 
summer holidays.

 Sunday, Sept. 20 was a busy day for 
LFW between Topshop and Vivienne 
Westwood. With Topshop’s Unique 
show bringing back looks from the 
’80s with sophisticated twists, com-
bined with Westwood’s societal mes-
sages, it was a fun-filled occasion in 
London.
 Topshop Unique brought back 
quintessential ’80s looks this Sunday. 
From bright colors to faux stolls to big 
patterns, it felt as though they were 
on the set of “Ferris Bueller’s Day 
Off.” The designers took this show to 
the next level though, and they did so 
by adding a twist to what could have 
been any ordinary ’80s apparel.
 Sexy. Whether that meant an 
extremely high slit on a dress, or a 
plunging neckline on a blouse, every 
look had a sexy and revealing aspect 
to it. This allowed for the whole show 
to be eye-catching from start to finish. 
 The show closed out with a series 
of lace gowns, continuing on the com-
bination of ’80s and sexy. Each gown 
was either embellished with pops 
of bright color or finished off with a 
discreet yet extremely high slit on the 
leg. These gowns were my favorite 
looks of the show, as they pulled off 
being discreetly sultry with a girly 
feel. 
 I give Topshop an A+ for the execu-
tion of the show. It was trendy and 
memorable, combining old looks with 
wearable twists. It fit my expecta-
tions for Topshop, of always being a 
brand that is ahead of the time but 

doing so in a way that allows people to 
wear looks straight from the runway. 
 Vivienne Westwood’s show could 
not have been more different from 
Topshop’s if it tried. The show itself 
didn’t blow me away. Every look 
seemed tired, outdated and frankly 
bland. I saw it as a try-hard attempt to 
push the bar … but a failed one. The 
looks seemed simply all over the place.
 The single most memorable part 
of the show itself was the makeup. 
The makeup was the only part that 
seemed to work in conjunction with 
the clothes well. It had a dark, omi-
nous, look. It complimented the tired 
clothes in a way that allowed for the 
designers to somewhat reach what I 
believe they were going for. But obvi-
ously this is a fashion show, not a 
makeup show, so it’s safe to say that I 
was disappointed.

 
 
 
 

Of course this wouldn’t be a true 
Vivienne Westwood show if it wasn’t 
topped off with some sort of activ-
ist message. Vivienne led a group of 
protestors marching together to end 
climate change. Westwood was at the 
front, speaking on how even activ-
ists downplay the severity of climate 
change too much. 
 I respect Vivienne Westwood for 
her attempt to make a change in the 
world. But all I have to say is that 
there is a time and a place for every-
thing. If she was going to do this, she 
should have made sure her clothes 
were incredible, because now all any-
one remembers from this show was 
her protest. Though I am not entirely 
sure that forgetting her looks is a bad 
idea …

-JULIA DOYLE

 Issa’s Creative Director Jamie 
O’Hare proved that the whole “no 
wearing white after Labor Day” 
myth is in fact just a myth as the 
opening looks for ISSA’s SS16 col-
lection were paraded through LFW 
in troves of elegant and refreshing 
whites. Issa is known to be a brand 
that is somewhat more accessible 
in design, as well as more readily 
available for the everyday person to 
work with. Sleek and bold designs 
from white jumpsuits to textured 
dresses, the theme of this show was 
a mix of knitwear-inspired looks 
and layered ensembles. 
 Paired with bold shoes and 
accessories, the clothes still man-
aged to stand on their own. O’Hare 
took a risk with this collection and 

experimented with both crocheted 
patterns and different textures. 
What could’ve undoubtedly been 
seen as a catastrophe of a design 
manages to look both posh and tea 
party ready — and by that of course 
I am referring to his series of lay-
ered dresses, tiered like a perfect 
wedding cake.
 The collection isn’t all elegance 
and grace, however. Issa can have 
a bit of grunge and edge to it as 
well — with stand-out designs 
with plunging necklines — so be 
prepared to show off some serious 
summer skin. Versatile and accessi-
ble, Issa’s SS16 LFW has something 
in it for everyone this season.

Daily Arts Writer

There are two types of peo-

ple in the world: those who 
love Mindy Kaling and every-
one who’s not 
hanging 
out 

with her.

For 
her 

fans, 
“The 

Mindy 
Proj-

ect” star, who 
first 
stepped 

onto the TV 
scene in “The 
Office,” 
is 
a 

sort of magical 
hybrid between Amy Schumer 
(“Inside Amy Schumer”) and 
Tina Fey (“30 Rock”) — an 
honest, oversexed pop culture 
queen and witty genius. But 
for her haters, Kaling is a bit 
whiny and self-absorbed — and 
judging from her memoirs, “Is 
Everyone Hanging Out Without 
Me?” and “Why Not Me?” — or 
her character’s insistence in 
season four that a “Southpark” 
pinball machine deserves floor 
space over a grand piano, they 
have a fair argument.

But despite her mixed recep-

tion among the public, critics 
adore her. Kaling was named 
in Time Magazine’s “Top 100 
Most Influential People” in 
2012, as well as one of Glam-
our’s “Women of the Year” for 
2014. In 2012, Kaling wrote, 
produced and starred in “The 

Mindy Project” on FOX, about 
an OB/GYN’s personal and pro-
fessional struggles at Shulman 
& Associates, a New York City 
medical clinic. The show was 
an immediate success, winning 
the Critic’s Choice Award for 
Most Exciting New Series.

It came as a shock when FOX 

cancelled the show after its 
third season last May. Despite 
critical acclaim and Kaling’s 
cult-like 
following, 
viewer-

ship was too low — probably 
because Millennials comprise 
the show’s core audience, many 
of whom prefer not to pay for 
cable TV. What 20-somethings 
do watch, however, are their 
computer screens. So, Hulu’s 
adoption of “Mindy Project” 
season four, switching the show 
from screen to stream, might be 
the best thing that’s happened 
to Mindy yet.

So far, Hulu doesn’t dis-

appoint. Season four begins 
dramatically: 
Mindy 
Lahiri 

(Kaling) 
and 
her 
cowork-

er-boyfriend, 
Danny 
(Chris 

Messina, “Vicky Christina Bar-
celona”), are expecting a child, 
but Danny has fled their shared 
NYC apartment for India to 
confront Mindy’s parents about 
his negative feelings toward 
marriage. 
Meanwhile, 
frus-

trated by her boyfriend’s stub-
bornness and abandonment, 
Mindy slams down his picture 
on their nightstand and falls 
asleep alone. But when she 
wakes, she finds herself in a 
“13 Going On 30”-like dream — 
cuddled beside her rich “Real 
Housewives” 
producer-hus-

band (“My favorite franchise 
of shows!”), played by none 
other than Joseph Gordon-
Levitt (“Don Jon”). 

It gets weirder (or, for Mindy, 

more fantastic). After her ini-
tial shock — “Oh no, did I break 
into Mariah Carey’s penthouse 
and fall asleep again?” — she’s 
swept up by her new life, where 
her pinball machine is promi-
nently on display and her rela-

‘Mindy Project’ new 
season pleasantly odd

A-

Mindy 
Project

Season 4 
Premiere

Hulu

tionship with Danny is back to 
their frenemy-ship of the past. 
Though the real Danny has 
a less-than-perfect scenario; 
Mindy’s 
Red 
Sox-obsessed 

parents have decided that an 
arranged marriage is fit for 
their daughter, so they enlist 
Danny to pick a prospective 
husband for Mindy.

Both Mindy’s and Danny’s situ-

ations soon spiral downwards, as 
Mindy realizes that she doesn’t 
want an open (fantasy) relation-
ship and Danny comes clean about 
his relationship with Mindy, sans-

marriage. Still dreaming, Mindy 
barges into Danny’s date with 
“Slumdog Millionaire” actress 
Freida Pinto — to whom she blurts, 
“You know, people tell me that 
we look so much alike. You must 
hear that, too, right?” — hoping 
to win him back. She jolts awake, 
then the real Danny materializes 
beside her, fresh from India with 
a surprise.

Where “Mindy Project” shines 

is with its whip-smart lines, cut-
ting into the core of pop culture 
and tradition. Talk of arranged 
marriages intermingles with Red 

Sox fandom, and Mindy’s guilt for 
cheating on her fantasy husband 
is quickly brushed off, as Gordon-
Levitt advocates open relation-
ships and encourages Mindy’s 
lingerie line, “slutty girdles for the 
sexually active obese.” The quick 
banter floats the show, allowing us 
to forgive its flaws, like cliché plot 
points (i.e., is Mindy really kiss-
ing Danny in the pouring rain?) 
and the characters’ overinflated 
quirks.

But really. Whether you like 

her or not, it’s about time to start 
hanging out with Mindy.

Despite her 

mixed reception 
among the public, 
critics adore her.

Like her or not, 
it’s about time 
to start hanging 
out with Mindy.

Utah (Sept. 3): Well, at least the mountains 
were cool?

Oregon State (Sept. 12): Imagine how Jim 
Harbaugh would have freaked out if Michigan 
lost.

Michigan State (Oct. 17): These teams play a 
week earlier than last year, which Mark Danto-
nio will take as a sign of blatant disrespect.

Minnesota (Oct. 31): Plot twist: Michigan plays 
Minnesota for the Little Orange Pumpkin.

Rutgers (Nov. 7): Will Michigan fans storm the 
field if the Wolverines avenge last year’s loss in 
Piscataway? We hope not.

UNLV (Sept. 19): More like Loss Vegas.

Indiana (Nov. 14): Boring state. Hopefully not a 
boring game.

BYU (Sept. 26): We don’t know who will score 
more points, but we do know who will leave the 
game with more wives.

Maryland (Oct. 3): Rumor has it, if you stare at 
Maryland’s state flag for too long, you become 
absorbed into the pattern.

Northwestern (Oct. 10): Are you ready for 
M00N pt. 2: N00M?

Ohio State (Nov. 28): We wanted to make a 
joke, but the only one we could think of was, 
“Haha, your backup QB might win the Heisman.”

Penn State (Nov. 21): Christian Hackenberg 
could be a first-round pi — aaand, he just got 
sacked again.

BYU’s miracles resemble 1994 
Michigan Stadium Hail Mary

Cougars come in at 
2-1 after two last-
minute victories

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Like a bad dream, Michigan 

fans toss and turn, wishing the 
Hail Mary would go away.

Since the “Miracle at Michigan” 

that 
gave 
No. 

7 
Colorado 
a 

stunning 
last-

second 
victory 

over the then-
fourth-ranked 
Wolverines 
on 
Sept. 
24, 

1994, any Hail 
Mary 
brings 

back 
memories 

of 
Buffaloes’ 

quarterback 
Kordell 
Stewart’s 
heavenly heave.

Twenty-one 

years and two days later, the 2015 
Michigan football team will do 
anything it can to avoid replicating 
that dreaded day.

It will be no small task, though, 

as the Wolverines (2-1) take on a 
No. 22 BYU team that has already 
beaten Nebraska and Boise State 
on last-second Hail Mary plays, 
and very nearly did it again against 
No. 9 UCLA.

“It’s tough to watch, especially 

as a secondary coach, to see 
those kind of throws from the 
quarterback,” 
said 
Michigan 

secondary coach Mike Zordich. 
“But it just adds to our challenge. 
… You play hard the whole game 
and you’re winning by one, two, 
three, maybe five points, whatever 
it is, you’d certainly hate for that 
last play to put the stamp on (the 
game).”

Hail Mary threat aside, slowing 

down the Cougars’ receivers, 
four of them 6-foot-4 or taller, is 
literally no small task.

“A big, big challenge,” Zordich 

said. “They’ve got four or five 
really good receivers that they’re 
rolling in every down, so they’re 
going to be fresh. We’ve got a big 
challenge ahead of us.

“Just physically, when you line 

Jourdan Lewis up against a 6-foot-
6 guy, as scrappy as Jourdan is, 
that’s a tough matchup. But that’s 
how we’re going to play it. They’ve 
got to fight.”

Even before the final plays, the 

Cougars have some bite to them. 
The most notable weapon is true 
freshman 
quarterback 
Tanner 

Mangum. Though years removed 
from his last competitive football 
days and fresh off a two-year 
missionary trip in Chile, Mangum 
has filled in admirably for the 
injured Taysom Hill.

Mangum doesn’t possess Hill’s 

mobility, but has kept BYU’s 
goals alive with a 62.3 completion 
percentage, 664 yards passing 
and four touchdowns. They aren’t 
award-winning numbers, but the 
big-play potential is there.

“He’s 
a 
playmaker,” 
said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“He went in there with no shyness 
whatsoever. Already being in 
big 
situations 
and 
prevailed. 

Sometimes it takes years before 
something like that happens, but 
he’s already been through it, so 
he’s already been battle-tested and 
won in those situations.”

Though Mangum and his big 

receivers pose a threat, Michigan’s 
secondary looks poised to rise to 
the occasion.

In the Wolverines’ 28-7 win 

over UNLV last week, junior 
cornerback Channing Stribling 
and redshirt-junior cornerback 
Jeremy 
Clark 
each 
grabbed 

interceptions, 
while 
junior 

cornerback Jourdan Lewis tallied 
a career-high four pass break-ups.

“They’re ascending,” Harbaugh 

said of the secondary. “Getting 
their hands on the ball, breaking 
up passes, intercepting passes and 
defending the deep ball. I think 
they’re doing a better job at that.”

On defense, BYU doesn’t have 

as much to boast about, and 
with starting nose tackle Travis 
Tuiloma out of the game with 
an injury, Michigan will have a 
chance to continue developing 
a run game that has piled on 479 
total rushing yards in its last two 
games.

The Wolverines’ coaching staff 

stated that junior running back 
De’Veon Smith would get the bulk 

of the carries. But with junior Ty 
Isaac gaining 114 yards last week 
and redshirt junior Drake Johnson 
continuing to progress, Michigan 
can count on options.

 
“We’ll 
see 
power 
about 

5,000 times. Well, that’s an 
exaggeration,” 
quipped 
BYU 

coach Bronco Mendenhall in his 
weekly teleconference Tuesday.

Added 
Cougar 
defensive 

lineman 
Graham 
Rowley 
on 

Wednesday: “You just dig into the 
dirt and power back. I’m excited 
for that.”

Across the board, Michigan 

matches up well with BYU. Both 
are still developing with first-
year quarterbacks and looking for 
consistency that can keep them 
performing at a high level.

Which presents the question: 

Do the Miracle Mormons have 
another Hail Mary ending in the 
making? If they do, Zordich has a 
plan.

“Personally, I just think guys 

relax,” he said. “Guys think, 
‘It’s not going to come my way,’ 
and they don’t do what they’re 
supposed to do. If you watch 
the Nebraska game, and I’m not 
picking on anybody because it 
certainly can happen to anybody, 
but one guy’s just watching. He’s 
watching the game, you know, and 
you just can’t do that.”

by Fleck’s many handy philosophies. 
“Row the Boat” is meant to remind 
everyone to do their part and stay in 
unison with the team. “Change your 
best” is a reminder to constantly 
improve, and “Elite” has turned into 
a constant description of all things 
relating to the team.

Fleck’s mantras are now part 

of Hart’s routine vernacular. He 
uses the word “elite” five times in 
a 13-minute interview, the ideal 
descriptor of Fleck’s system.

On one play during warmups, 

freshman running back LeVante 
Bellamy runs the wrong route. Hart, 
walking over to him, rhetorically 
shouts, 
“What’s 
the 
play?” 
As 

Bellamy looks on at him, Hart does a 
paddling motion, shorthand for “Row 
the Boat.”

He does these things not because 

“Bronconese” is the only language 
he speaks anymore, but because in 
order to add them to his coaching 
repertoire, he has to master them 
first.

These philosophies are what 

Hart will eventually take from his 
time in Kalamazoo, his foray into 
unchartered coaching waters.

“He’s really an elite example of 

what it means to be a Bronco,” Fleck 
says after practice. “But it stems 
from his time at Michigan as well.”

Fleck knows a lot about building 

a program. Someday, Hart wants to 
emulate his methods, if he ever gets 
the chance to be a head coach. He’d 
like that, but not anytime soon. He’s 
still learning, after all, and the more 
logical next step for him would be to 
become an offensive coordinator.

“When he got here, my job is to 

take him to the next step,” Fleck 
said. “Develop him to (what) he 
wants to become, and then wherever 
he goes from here, or whatever he 
does after me, he’s gonna take a 
piece of me too and carry that on. 
You’re just gaining experience. He 
doesn’t know everything yet, but you 
never will.”

That kind of experience is what 

drew Hart to the Broncos in the 
first place. Fleck has an infectious 
personality, and learning how to 
generate enthusiasm will be one of 
the most important things Hart can 
learn from Fleck. 

In fact, many of the things he has 

picked up aren’t so unlike what he’s 
taken from his Michigan mentors.

The lesson he says he’ll take 

from Fleck is to “change your best.” 
He likes its simple meaning that 
yesterday’s effort isn’t good enough 
today. It shouldn’t be surprising, then, 
that the phrase he most remembers 
from Carr is similar: “You either get 
better or worse every day.”

“I’ll make my own in 10 years,” 

Hart said. “But there’s something 

I’ve learned from every (coach), 
something I’ve loved from every one 
of them.”

In that way, Hart’s experience 

isn’t entirely unique. On some level, 
he’s still aspiring to be the same kind 
of coach, with the same core values 
he learned at Michigan. He’s just 
learning to do it in different ways.

“I’m blessed to be here,” Hart 

said. “I’m a 10-times better coach 
than I was. I didn’t realize it at that 
time — I knew this would be a great 
place to come because I knew they 
were going to have success, but I 
didn’t know how much of a better 
coach they were going to make me.”

But behind Hart as he says all 

this is that countdown clock on the 
scoreboard — a stark reminder that 
Hart’s next step is not another job 
switch, but another season.

***

Sept. 4 came and went, and the 

Spartans showed up to play. Western 
Michigan held things closer than 
expected, but there was no upset in 
store. Michigan State 37, Western 
Michigan 24.

The Spartans held Franklin to 

23 yards, and Georgia Southern 
limited him to 58 in the next game. 
Adjustments were in store for the 
Broncos.

Fortunately for them, Hart is a 

film rat. Always has been, probably 
always will be.

When Hart made the varsity team 

as a freshman at Onondaga Central 
High School in Syracuse, New York, 
coach Bill Spicer didn’t quite know 
what he was getting. He knew Hart’s 
talent, but he was still surprised at his 
knowledge and at his work ethic.

“Every lunch period, he would 

come down, and him and I would 
watch film,” Spicer said. “That was 
from freshman year on. … He would 
be in my office during lunch period 
every single day. During the season 
and offseason, he would probably be 
in there three or four times a week.

“There were times when I would 

be breaking the film, like a Saturday 
afternoon or something, and the guys 
would come down to lift and then 
they left. And he would stick around, 
and we would break down film. And 
there were times when I would go 
onto another play and he would be 
like, ‘Wait a minute coach, go back to 
that one, I want to check something 
out.’ ”

Hart has known he wanted to be 

a coach since at least high school, 
maybe even a little before it.

And as Spicer recalls, it was 

unusual having a player who was that 
plugged in at such a young age.

“As a coach, you’ve gotta let your 

barriers down a little bit when you’ve 
got a kid like that,” Spicer said. “He’d 
come off on the sideline and say, ‘Hey 

coach, if we run this play I think it’s 
gonna be wide open.’ … You’ve gotta 
swallow your pride a little bit. You 
run the play and the kid’s running for 
a touchdown because two reasons: 
No. 1, he would see it. No. 2, because 
he said it to me, he’s gonna make sure 
it works.”

Those are habits Hart carries to 

this day — habits he learned in high 
school, then honed at Michigan. 
More importantly, these are habits 
that will make or break his ability to 
continue to climb coaching ladders.

When Hart arrived at Michigan, 

David Underwood — then a senior — 
remembers being surprised at how 
well Hart could understand what was 
happening on film.

“A lot of freshmen come in, (and) 

they’re watching film, but they 
don’t know what they’re looking at,” 
Underwood said. “It’s like glancing 
at a TV. Yeah, you’re watching TV, 
but are you actually soaking that 
information up? Do you know what 
you’re looking at? He was able to 
understand and really watch.”

Now, he’s trying to transfer those 

abilities to his own group of young 
backs. Franklin said that when the 
Bronco running backs go in for a film 
session, they often find Hart already 
in the room with film rolling.

“He teaches us a lot of life lessons,” 

Franklin said. “There’s a quote he 
always says: ‘To be forewarned is to 
be forearmed.’ I’m always trying to 
watch film and forewarn myself.”

Perhaps 
that 
helps 
explain 

why 
after 
two 
below-average 

performances, Franklin rebounded 
for 161 yards against Murray State, in 
the Broncos’ first win of the year last 
Saturday.

It’s hard not to wonder what the 

Broncos have in store for their next 
matchup, another team with which 
Hart has a past: Ohio State. He 
doesn’t talk much about Michigan’s 
rivalries now that he’s at Western 
Michigan, but the fact remains that 
he never beat the Buckeyes. He was 
part of the first class to go four years 
without beating Ohio State since 
1960-1963.

The Buckeyes may not be a rivalry 

game for Hart’s Broncos, but they do 
present an opportunity to accomplish 
one of the few things he never did at 
Michigan.

***

Hart laughs when asked whether 

going to Western Michigan was a 
lateral move, giving a diplomatic 
answer about how blessed he is to be 
there, and how it was good to get out 
of his comfort zone.

Hart made lateral moves as a 

player all the time. Many of them 
eventually turned into touchdowns.

His former coach, Spicer, knows 

well that Hart didn’t make the move 

without good reason.

“I think you have many, many 

moves in coaching,” Spicer said. “You 
make so many moves that it looks like 
it might be lateral to the naked eye, 
but it’s really not. There’s always a 
rhyme or a reason.”

For Hart, some of those reasons 

are clear now — learning from Fleck, 
leaving the nest of the Michigan 
network — but others may not show 
up for years.

To understand Hart and where he 

is on his path, all you have to do is go 
back to that practice in August, when 
the offense pulled off a final-round 
victory over the defense in the box 
drill.

As the players ran down the field 

celebrating, Hart was among them, 
toward the back, pumping his fist in 

victory. Fleck stayed behind. 

Hart is still somewhere between 

his two careers — the star player and 
the polished coach. He will learn a 
little from every stop, and eventually, 
he’ll have a unique coaching style all 
his own. At that point, he’ll be the 
one halting practice, offering all-
or-nothing deals to his offense and 
defense.

But for now, just four years 

removed from playing, he still has 
a lot to learn about coaching, and 
plenty still to accomplish.

This Saturday, he’ll travel to 

Columbus, where he’ll be in a familiar 
place in different colors. The odds 
will be long, far longer than they ever 
were when Hart was at Michigan. 

It’s different at Western Michigan. 

That’s why he went there.

Michigan’s all-time 

leading rusher is 

honing his coaching 
skills in Kalamazoo

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

KALAMAZOO, 
Mich. 
— 

Michigan’s last great running back 
wears a brown shirt now. It’s August, 
and Mike Hart, now 29 years old, is 
standing under a pocket in the clouds 
wearing sunglasses and a visor, 
waiting for Western Michigan’s 
football practice to start.

The scoreboards in both end zones 

are counting down the 17 days until 
Michigan State comes to Kalamazoo. 
The Broncos will need every minute 
of preparation to have a chance.

When he was at Michigan, the 

Spartans were a calendar opponent 
for Hart because they meant rivalry. 
But he’s a Bronco, for now, and 
Michigan State is only meaningful 
because his new team is looking for 
the upset.

Practice starts, and after about 20 

minutes, Broncos coach P.J. Fleck, 

the youngest head coach in the nation 
at 34 years old, blows his whistle.

“BOX!” he shouts, and the players 

and coaches stop what they’re doing 
and sprint to the center. The players 
form a circle — maybe it’s supposed 
to be a box — around two players. 
One is in brown and one in gold, and 
they lock up with pride on the line. 
It’s offense versus defense. One-on-
one. First knee to touch the turf loses. 

Sports Illustrated called Fleck’s 

tenure at Western Michigan “college 
football’s most fascinating sociology 
experiment,” and it’s easy to see 
why. The players in the middle of 
the circle go through four rounds of 
these battles, finally ending when 
Fleck — the third-year coach known 
for his enthusiasm and unorthodox 
methods — challenges the defense to 
defend its title in an all-or-nothing 
final match. The defense loses, 
and Hart and the offensive players 
celebrate by running down the field, 
jumping up and down.

This process takes about 15 

minutes of the two-hour practice. 
They’re taking a substantial amount 
of time for an activity that, frankly, 
seems kind of silly.

Two hours to the east, in Ann 

Arbor, the Michigan football team is 
in its figurative submarine, shielded 
from all publicity. There, the outside 
world is told, they run as a reward 
after a four-hour practice. It’s hard 
to say how similar it is because few 
are allowed to see inside.

But in Kalamazoo, this part of 

practice is open to the media. The 
local CBS affiliate has a camera 
rolling. Things seem different here.

For Hart, that’s not necessarily so 

bad.

***

For much of his football career, 

Hart has done things the Michigan 
way. He played for Lloyd Carr at 
Michigan from 2004 to 2008, and 
after a three-year stint in the NFL, 
he coached under former Wolverines 
defensive coordinator Ron English at 
Eastern Michigan.

He’s proud of that. He says he 

loves Carr “to death” and speaks 
fondly of English, who gave him his 
first coaching job. But at a certain 
point, he had to learn to do things 
differently.

So after three years coaching 

at Eastern Michigan — the first in 
charge of offensive quality control, 
the next two as running backs 
coach — Hart accepted the same 
job working for Fleck at Western 
Michigan before the 2014 season.

At the time, some wondered 

whether it was a lateral move. But 
for Hart, who coached the Eagles’ 
Bronson Hill to a 1,100-yard season 
in 2013, Western Michigan offered 
something new.

“All 
I 
knew 
was, 
kind 
of, 

Michigan,” Hart said. “With Coach 
English, Lloyd — that’s the only 
way that we did things. And not 
bad things. But I needed to open my 
horizons.”

For Fleck, hiring Hart wasn’t a 

tough choice. Being Michigan’s all-
time leading rusher bought him 
instant credibility with recruits, and 
Fleck had already been hearing rave 
reviews about Hart from prospects.

“(They said), ‘Mike Hart, I love 

Mike Hart.’ That’s what I continued 
to hear on the recruiting trail,” Fleck 
said.

Hart was also familiar with Fleck 

and decided the fit was right. He 
and his wife Monique packed up 
their two children and moved to 
Kalamazoo, where Hart inherited a 
stable of mostly very young running 
backs.

Among 
them 
was 
Jarvion 

Franklin, a gifted freshman from 
Tinley Park, Ill. It became clear that 
Franklin was going to carry the load, 
which left Hart with the difficult 
task of building an 18-year old into a 
workhorse tailback.

“It’s a good and a bad thing, 

because 
whatever 
they 
learn, 

you’re teaching them,” Fleck said of 
coaching true freshmen. “But the bad 
thing is, whatever you teach them, 
they’re learning. So you’ve gotta 
make sure it’s all the right things 
you’re teaching them, ‘cause they’re 
like a sponge year one. There’s 
nothing like year one.”

Fortunately 
for 
Fleck 
and 

Franklin, Hart had some firsthand 
knowledge.

When Hart was a freshman, 

Michigan’s senior starter, David 
Underwood, was injured in the 
second game of the season, against 
Notre Dame. After that game, 
the Chicago Tribune published a 
column titled “Michigan is out of the 
running,” detailing the Wolverines’ 
ground-game woes. Hart wasn’t even 
mentioned as a possible solution.

The next week, Hart burst onto 

the scene with 121 yards and never 
looked back. He and his quarterback, 
fellow freshman Chad Henne, led 
the team all the way back to the Rose 
Bowl, where Michigan lost to Texas.

So naturally, when Hart was 

tasked 
with 
preparing 
another 

running back to shock the country, 
he had credibility.

“I was leaning on him a lot,” 

Franklin said. “He was really our 
rock.”

All Franklin did last year was rush 

for 1,551 yards and 24 touchdowns, 
fourth most in the nation.

On the practice field at Waldo 

Stadium, Hart is now engrained in 
the Broncos’ culture, which is defined

Breakdown: Michigan vs. BYU

Wolverines face 

tough test Saturday

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In two home games this year, 

the Michigan football team has 
faced less than one quarter of 
adversity. Since the Wolverines 
forced a fumble early in the first 
quarter against Oregon State 
and then scored 35 unanswered 
points, they have rolled.

But Saturday could be an 

entirely different test.

This 
week, 
Michigan 
(2-1) 

faces No. 23 Brigham Young (2-1) 
at Michigan Stadium in its non-
conference finale. The Cougars won 
their first two games in dramatic 
fashion, shocking Nebraska in their 
opener on a game-ending Hail 
Mary, then topping Boise State on 
a 35-yard touchdown pass with 45 
seconds left.

The Wolverines are in for a 

tough battle Saturday. Here’s how 
things break down:

Michigan pass offense vs. Utah 
pass defense

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake Rudock has been under the 
microscope for throwing five 
interceptions in his first three 
games. The three he threw 
against Utah were costly, but the 
last two were not. If he can have 
his first turnover-free game of the 
season Saturday, he will give the 
Wolverines a chance to win.

He has also established a 

wider arsenal of targets, though 
not many have been consistent. 
Thirteen players have caught 
passes, but just two have more 
than five — Amara Darboh has 16, 
and Jake Butt has 14. Michigan 
will look to establish more threats 
in the passing game as well as 
some deep throws downfield.

The Cougars’ passing defense 

struggled in the first two games, 
allowing 308 yards per game, but 
it locked down UCLA’s Josh Rosen 
last week, giving up just 106 yards 
and picking off three passes. BYU 
is tied for first in the nation with 
seven interceptions — including 
four by defensive back Kai Nacua 
— so keeping the football will be a 
challenge for Rudock.

Edge: BYU

Michigan rush offense vs. BYU 
rush defense

The 
Wolverines 
have 
had 

more success running the ball 
this season, and now they might 
have a host of players to carry 
it. Junior running back De’Veon 
Smith leads the team with 53 
carries — almost half of the 
team’s 116 — for 206 yards. But 
junior Ty Isaac had a breakout 
game last week with 114 yards 
and a touchdown, and redshirt 
junior Drake Johnson continues 
to work his way back into the fold 
after he suffered the second torn 
anterior cruciate ligament of his 
career last November.

Much of their success comes 

from an improved offensive line, 
led by fifth-year senior center 
Graham 
Glasgow. 
That 
line 

will face a BYU front headed by 
6-foot-8, 280-pound defensive 
end Bronson Kaufusi.

As with pass defense, the 

Cougars’ rush defense is in 
the bottom half in the country. 
They did, however, slow down 
Nebraska and Boise State before 
giving up 296 yards to UCLA last 
week. Michigan has not yet faced 
a straight 3-4 defense (Oregon 
State 
played 
with 
a 
hybrid 

defensive end-linebacker similar 
to Michigan’s buck position).

Edge: Michigan

BYU pass offense vs. Michigan 
pass defense

BYU’s offense has had the most 

success on the last plays of games, 
but it has moved the ball well the 
rest of the game, too. The Cougars 
recovered nicely from the loss of 
starting quarterback Taysom Hill 
to a season-ending foot injury. 
Hill totaled 340 yards and three 
touchdowns in the opener before 
going down and being replaced by 
Tanner Mangum. Mangum, 22, is 
still a true freshman following a 
two-year Mormon mission before 
college.

He has played more like his 

age than his year in school, 
leading BYU on fourth-quarter 
comebacks 
against 
Nebraska 

and Boise State before the magic 
ran out at UCLA. At 136, his 
quarterback rating is 17.5 points 
higher than Rudock’s. He has 
the ability to throw from outside 
the pocket and has a host of 
big, talented receivers at his 

disposal. The leader is 6-foot-6 
Mitch Mathews, who jumped up 
and caught the Hail Mary in the 
season opener.

Though Michigan has touted 

BYU’s receivers all week, the 
Wolverines also have a capable 
secondary 
to 
defend 
them. 

Junior defensive backs Channing 
Stribling 
and 
Jeremy 
Clark 

intercepted passes last week, and 
Michigan has forced the opposing 
team to change quarterbacks in 
two straight games. But Mangum 
is a different animal.

BYU rush offense vs. Michigan 
rush defense

The Cougars have been a pass-

first team, largely by necessity — 
because they’ve faced deficits late 
in games and because running 
back Jamaal Williams withdrew 
from school just before fall camp. 
BYU ranks 111th in the nation in 
rush offense, but running back 
Adam Hine has managed 279 
yards and two touchdowns in 
three games.

Michigan’s stout defensive front 

will match up against a young 
BYU 
offensive 
line 
featuring 

only one senior. Several players 
have emerged on defense for the 

Wolverines early in the season. 
Redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Chris Wormley has seven tackles 
for loss, junior defensive end Taco 
Charlton has forced a fumble and 
senior linebacker Joe Bolden leads 
the team in tackles with 26.

The best-case scenario for 

Michigan 
is 
to 
play 
tough 

defense against the run, force 
BYU into passing situations and 
then bring the pressure against 
Mangum to try to rattle him. If 
the Wolverines can feed off the 
Michigan 
Stadium 
crowd, 
it 

would help.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Michigan has made a sizable 

jump in this area since a mediocre 
2014. Senior kicker Kenny Allen 
is 3-for-4 in limited field-goal 
opportunities, 
and 
fifth-year 

senior Blake O’Neill is averaging 
40.9 yards per punt with a 59-yard 
bomb last week.

Then 
there’s 
the 
big-play 

threat: 
redshirt 
freshman 

defensive back Jabrill Peppers, 
who ran back a punt 24 yards last 
week and has the ability to score 
if he finds some space.

BYU is in a similar situation. 

Punter Jonny Linehan has been 

solid (42.6 yards per punt), and 
the Cougars have had limited 
opportunities in the return game. 
The difference maker could be 
kicker Trevor Samson, who is 
a perfect 5-for-5 on the season, 
including 3-for-3 from beyond 40 
yards.

Edge: BYU

Intangibles

After two easy wins at Michigan 

Stadium, the Wolverines are 
back to being doubted, to some 
extent. They went to Utah as six-
point underdogs and face a tough 
test with the tall receivers of 
BYU. Knowing how competitive 
Saturday’s 
game 
will 
be, 

Michigan should play with a little 
extra edge.

The 
Cougars, 
meanwhile, 

were flying high last week after 
two straight thrilling victories 
landed them in the top 25. Then 
they traveled to UCLA and fell 
just short of a monumental upset 
of the Bruins. Has the high worn 
off? The answer will be apparent 
early on Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Prediction: BYU 28, Michigan 
25

What to Watch For: Rudock 
seeks INT-free performance

Wolverines face tall 

receivers, potent 
passing attack 
against Cougars

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

The last two weekends have 

not provided much of a test for 
the Michigan football team, as 
the Wolverines easily pushed 
aside Oregon State and UNLV 
in their first two home games 
of the season. Things will likely 
be different this weekend when 
No. 23 Brigham Young comes to 
town.

Last week, the Cougars stayed 

close with then-No. 10 UCLA, 
losing by one point. The Bruins 
scored late in the fourth quarter 
to take the lead for good, and BYU 
failed to respond.

Here’s what to watch for as 

Michigan looks to make one last 
statement in non-conference play.

1. Is this the week Jake Rudock 
turns things around?

The 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback has thrown five 
interceptions in the season’s first 
three games, the same number 
he threw all of last season with 
Iowa. Despite the rough statistics, 
nobody in Michigan’s program 
seems to be concerned about 
Rudock, at least publicly.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

said Monday that Rudock is 
the 
team’s 
best 
quarterback, 

“and not by a small margin,” 
quelling any doubt that he was 
second-guessing his decision to 
make Rudock the team’s starter. 
Instead, Harbaugh, Rudock and 
some of Michigan’s receivers have 
said that some of the struggles 
will fade over time as Rudock and 
the receivers continue to get on 
the same page.

Saturday’s game might leave no 

room for the turnovers that the 
Wolverines could afford in their 
previous two games. Michigan 
may also have to convert on some 
of the deep balls that have eluded 

receivers’ grasps so far.

2. 
How 
can 
Michigan’s 

secondary match up with big 
wide receivers?

The Wolverines have not faced 

a pass-happy offense like BYU’s so 
far this season. So far, Michigan’s 
secondary has limited big plays 
through the air, but that will be 
put to the test this weekend. The 
Cougars attempted 47 passes 
against UCLA last week.

What will make the challenge 

more difficult is that BYU has 
some 
size 
out 
wide. 
Mitch 

Mathews, the team’s second-
leading 
receiver, 
is 
6-foot-6. 

Nick Kurtz, the Cougars’ fourth-
leading receiver, is 6-foot-5.

Michigan junior cornerback 

Jourdan Lewis, who had four 
pass breakups last week, is just 
5-foot-10. He has insisted that 

facing taller wide receivers will 
not be an issue, that he can make 
up for the height with technique. 
Harbaugh has said the same.

Look to see if their words ring 

true Saturday or if height really 
does matter.

3. Can the defense create 
turnovers?

The Wolverines’ defense has 

been preaching the importance 
of takeaways all week. Michigan 
had 
two 
interceptions 
last 

week against UNLV, but it still 
does not appear to be satisfied. 
The approach of the defensive 
coaching staff is that the team’s 
defenders should be trying to get 
the ball back for the offense on 
every single possession, and that 
has not yet come to fruition.

The Wolverines could have an 

opportunity to create turnovers 

against BYU. The Cougars start 
a true freshman at quarterback 
in Tanner Mangum. Though he 
has displayed a great deal of poise 
early in his career, road games 
always provide a test for young 
players.

If Mangum airs it out 47 times 

like he did last week, Michigan’s 
secondary will no doubt be 
looking for turnovers. Whether 
the Wolverines take advantage is 
another matter entirely. It will be 
another opportunity for them to 
create their desired reputation as 
ball hawks.

4. Will the Wolverines be able 
to run the ball successfully for 
a third straight game?

Michigan has enjoyed great 

success running the ball the 
past two weeks, scampering for 
more than 200 yards in back-

to-back games. Junior running 
back De’Veon Smith led the way 
against Oregon State, and junior 
running back Ty Isaac did the 
same against UNLV.

How exactly carries will be 

distributed this weekend remains 
to be seen. But if the offensive line 
can create holes the way it has the 
past two weeks, it could bode well 
for the team in Big Ten play.

BYU’s rush defense is far from 

daunting. It ranks 74th among 
all Football Bowl Subdivision 
schools, but after the struggles 
the Wolverines have had the 
last few years running the ball, 
another successful week would 
enhance the confidence of the 
offensive line even further.

Wolverines replace questions with 
exclamation points in rushing game

Smith still No. 1 

back, but gap closing 
as all four running 

backs emerge

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Before the 2015 season began, 

one of the biggest question 
marks surrounding the Michigan 
football team was in the backfield.

It wasn’t a matter of whether 

they could perform — redshirt 
junior Drake Johnson and juniors 
Ty Isaac, De’Veon Smith and 
Derrick Green had all shown 
flashes of being a lead back in 
previous seasons — but rather 
a question of how many of the 
backs would see the field, and if a 
multiple-back system could work.

After 
two 
dominant 
wins 

over Oregon State and UNLV in 
which the Wolverines totaled 479 
rushing yards and seven rushing 
touchdowns, the question marks 
surrounding 
Michigan’s 
run 

game have been replaced with 
exclamation points.

“We’re 
progressing 
in 
the 

right direction,” said Michigan 
running backs coach Tyrone 
Wheatley. “We’re going the right 
direction. Each guy’s going the 
right direction. Each game we’re 
improving. Each game we’re 
picking up little things we’re 
getting better at.”

From a statistical perspective, 

the 
carries 
have 
primarily 

gone to Smith, but all four have 
performed when they needed to:

Smith: 53 carries, 206 yards, 

3.9 yards per carry, 3 touchdowns

Isaac: 18 carries, 161 yards, 8.9 

YPC, 1 touchdown

Green: 13 carries, 46 yards, 3.5 

YPC, 1 touchdown

Johnson: 6 carries, 31 yards, 

5.2 YPC, 0 touchdowns

The 
numbers 
are 
a 
little 

deceptive, as different backs come 
in at different situations. That 
said, every back is making forward 
progress, as the Wolverines are 
sixth in the nation with just eight 
tackles for loss allowed.

With Johnson’s role increasing 

by the day after tearing his 
anterior cruciate ligament for the 

second time last November, the 
backfield might look a little hectic 
at times, but the Wolverines see a 
method to the madness.

“I wouldn’t look at it as 

throwing guys in there,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“We’ve got football players that 
are hungry, that want to be in 
there, that are improving and 
making 
contributions 
to 
the 

team, 
and 
there’s 
something 

about not just throwing a guy in 
but strategically putting a player 
in to be successful.”

Isaac was the most successful 

last week. In a game that was 
over almost as soon as it began, 
Isaac broke free for a 76-yard 
touchdown run to pave the way 
for his game-high 114 yards.

In the second half, Green 

and Johnson took most of the 
snaps. Green — whom Wheatley 

assured wasn’t in the doghouse 
despite lackluster numbers — was 
the fourth back to be used, as 
Johnson continues to build to a 
heavier load.

“I’m 
not 
a 

doctor and I’m 
not in Drake’s 
knee, 
so 
I 

don’t 
know,” 

Wheatley said. 
“Right now, he 
looks good. He’s 
doing well. Of 
all the things 
we’ve 
asked 

him to do to 
this point, he’s 
passed 
with 

flying colors, so up until now I 
would say he looks good.”

As for the matchup against No. 

23 BYU, the Cougars gave up 296 
rushing yards against No. 9 UCLA 

last week, suggesting Michigan 
will once again rely on its run 
game to carry the offensive load.

Wheatley isn’t quite sure how 

he’ll split up the carries, but he 

knows the game 
plan will be the 
same for all the 
backs.

“Each 
week 

is pretty much 
the same thing 
for us in the 
backfield,” 
he 

said. “A) reduce 
— pretty much 
reduce, 
have 

no 
negative 

yards 
rushing. 

B) Try not to leave any yards out 
there, meaning let’s hit the right 
tracks, hit the right marks, right 
cuts. Let’s not leave any yards 
out there. And C) I would just 

say pass protection. Protect the 
quarterback.”

Of course, there’s one more 

matter of importance to the 
run game. The Wolverines have 
rushed the ball 116 times, and 
have yet to fumble the ball once. 
After coughing up the ball eight 
times last season, the decrease is 
a welcome change for Michigan.

Wheatley — who felt compelled 

to knock on wood after hearing 
the stat — feels the negative 
consequences afforded by the 
position’s depth have led to the 
improved effort.

“There’s two ways to really 

get put on the bench: A) get the 
quarterback hit, B) put the ball on 
the ground,” Wheatley said. “All 
the guys want to play, so you’ve 
just got to put one stigma in their 
mind about sitting on the bench, 
and then it kind of hits home.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Junior running back De’Veon Smith has received by far the most carries for Michigan, but fellow junior Ty Isaac had a breakout game of his own last weekend.

“We’ve got 

football 

players that 
are hungry.”
