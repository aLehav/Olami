Michigan advances
to NCAA title game
vs. Louisville
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
ATLANTA - Just 40 more
minutes remain of the college
basketball season.
Michigan (12-6 Big Ten, 31-7
overall) and Louisville (14-4 Big
East, 34-5) face off in the Nation-
al Championship game on Mon-

day night, and unlike the last
few opponents, each team has
high praises
and respect for Michigan vs.
one another in Louisville
their respective
NCAA Tourna- Mchigan1

ment runs. Louisville 34-5
"Michigan,
one day of prep, When:
is very difficult Monday
to prepare for,"
said Louisville Where:
coach Rick Piti- Georgia Dome
no. "On paper TV/Radio:
you would say CBS

this is a young basketball team.
But because (Michigan coach
John Beilein) has done such a
great job molding this team, they
play like seniors. You don't see
guys pass, catch and shoot like
that. This is a remarkable team
the way they share, the way they
pass. They don't play like a young
basketball team."
Beilein says the same thing
about Pitino, whom he admires
greatly - and it's well deserved
on both sides. Each coach has
molded his respective team to
playing the nation's best basket-

ball at just the right time.
The Cardinals are the one
of the nation's best defensive
teams, running a full-court press
scheme that likes to trap and
hound ball handlers into forcing
turnovers. Louisville holds oppo-
nents to 58.3 points per game this
season, and 60.8 points per game
during the tournament.
But a great defense is nothing
new to Michigan, which boasts
one of the nation's highest-scor-
ing offenses. The Wolverines
had to go through Virginia Com-
monwealth's infamous "Havoc"

full-court press, Kansas' tough
interior defense, Florida's physi-
cality and Syracuse's 2-3 zone to
reach the National Champion-
ship game, and have done so by
sharing the ball well and getting
quality shots.
"What's reallyunique is every-
one has been very different, even
thoughthey're all good defensive
teams," Beilein said. "VCU is an
animal of its own with the way
they continue to apply pressure
to you. It's different than Flori-
da's. I hope we can do one more,
just one more game where we

can put 60-to-70 points up there
in these games. We could have a
'W' if we can put up those num-
ber of points."
That shouldn't be too big of
a concern for the Wolverines.
Michigan has the National Player
of the Year in sophomore point
guard Trey Burke and a slew of
capable ball handlers, includ-
ing backup point guard Spike
Albrecht, that slit through VCU's
press and handled Florida's on-
ball pressure. The Wolverines are
also the best team in the nation

At exactly 4 p.m. Sunday
afternoon, 1,000 exhausted stu-

They had been on their feet for

Proppe to become
CSG president after
Osborn disqualified
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
and STEPHEN YAROS
Daily StaffReporter
About 25 members of forUM
and youMICH attended the
Central Student Judiciary's
hearing on Saturday that upheld
the University Elections Com-
mission's decision to disqualify
the winners of the Central Stu-
dent Government's presidential
election.
While the two groups of sup-
porters were seated only a few
feet apart, the CSJ's polemic
final ruling has only pushed the
sides further apart and raised
questions about the steps can-
didates and parties will take to
win an election.
It initially appeared that LSA
juniors Chris Osborn and Hay-
ley Sakwa, forUM's respective
presidential and vice presiden-
tial candidates, would be the
next executives of CSG after
received nearly 500 votes more
than their closest competitors -
Business junior Michael Proppe
and LSA sophomore Bobby
Dishell, youMICH's presiden-

tial and vice presidential candi-
dates.
Members of youMICH filed a
complaint claiming that Osborn
was influencing students while
they voted and provided pho-
tographic evidence of Osborn
standing near voters while they
were on the CSG voting site.
The UEC issued eight demer-
its to Osborn and Sakwa, more
than five necessary to disqual-
ify a candidate from the elec-
tion. Though Sakwa was not
involved in the influence of vot-
ers, election rules mandate that
both party candidates must be
removed from the election.
Proppe and Dishell are now
rising president and vice presi-
dent of CSG, but Proppe, who
didn't attend the CSJ or initial
UEC hearing, said this wasn't
how he wanted itto happen.
LSA sophomore Laurel Ruza,
the chair of youMICH, said it
was never the party's goal to
disqualify an opponent.
"It's not our intent to kick
people out - it's that we see a
violation, we're filing it," Ruza
said. "We see the code broken,
we'd like to address it."
Osborn said he found it "iron-
ic" that Ruza had previously said
that youMICH did not think
hearings were the appropriate

Day of speakers
and performers
draws 1,300
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
Former student body presi-
dent Chris Armstrong admits
he considered taking his own
life after he was stalked and

bullied for being gay by Andrew
Shirvell, then an assistant
attorney general of the state of
Michigan. But thanks to family,
friends and a supportive Univer-
sity community, Armstrong said
he was not only able to overcome
the bullying, but also tap into his
potential to spread a message of
hope to others suffering from
the same abuse.
Armstrong's speech was one
of 20 during the fourth annual

TEDxUofM, a student-run, day-
long conference based on "ideas
worth spreading" that brought
1,300 University students and
faculty to the Power Center on
Friday. "Untapped." was this
year's theme: Speakers present-
ed on a range of topics, from the
untapped human potential in
Detroit to the untapped abilities
of a "wannabe rock star" turned
anthropologist.
Broken into three sessions

- Unexplored, Unleashed and
Unveiled - the conference
moved swiftly from speaker to
speaker. In between sessions,
attendees were treatedto round-
table discussions on various top-
ics, caffeine-infused cookies and
live-music performances.
Armstrong, the last speaker
of the day, claimed he didn't
have a solution for stopping bul-
lies, choosing instead to discuss

Art show aims to empower
survivors of sexual violence

PATRICK BARRON/Daily

PubliCcarts discussion
reignited at FestiFools

SAPAC's annual
event showcases
community work
By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily StaffReporter
For individuals affected by
sexual violence, art is more than
a freedom of expression - it's a
helpinghand.
It was on this premise that
the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness
Center held the closing recep-
tion for their eighth annual art
show, rEVOLUTION: Making
Art for Change, on Friday night.
The exhibit, centered on themes
of gender, sexism, sexual vio-
lence and empowerment, fea-
tured pieces of art contributed
by SAPAC volunteer programs,
University students, members of
the Ann Arbor community and
regional artists.
Art and Design alum Emily
Kripitz, a SAPAC member, ini-
tially created the exhibit as her
senior project eight years ago
in order to artistically express
the influence of social justice in
the sexual violence movement.
SAPAC decided to carry on the
legacy and message of the project
by making it an annual event.
The Clothesline Project, con-
sisting of t-shirts strung on a
clothesline across a wall, was a
prominent work at the exhibit.
It was started in 1990 to depict
sexual violence against women.
Men and women survivors of
sexual violence, as well as their
supporters, decorate a t-shirt

with words, phrases and designs.
SAPAC's Men's Activism Pro-
gram also contributed to the
show, creating a collage with
hundreds of male hands from
different backgrounds wear-
ing red bracelets with the words
"These Hands Don't Hurt" print-
ed onthem, signifying a pledge to
end sexual violence.
LSA senior Ellie Howe, a
SAPAC coordinator, said find-
ing a means of expression is an
important part of the healing
process for survivors.
"From what I've seen and talk-
ed to survivors, it's about finding
the voice," Howe said. "But that
doesn't have to be just through
words - it can be through
expression of all types. And I
think that arc is a really unique
way for survivors to voice their
experience in a way that makes
sense to them and fits them."
LSA senior Lauren McIntosh,
SAPAC's Networking, Publishing
and Activism program coordina-
tor, also said the creative outlet
that art provides is key for ame-
liorating the situations of survi-
vors as well as supporters.
"It's a way you can express
yourself that you can't always
express in words," Macintosh
said.
Recent LSA graduate Emily
Blankenship was one of the fea-
tured artists at the event. She
volunteered at SAPAC during
her senior year and submitted
a piece to the 2013 show. This
year, she created a piece influ-
enced by the academy-award-
nominated documentary, "The
Invisible War," which shows

insight into the widespread
sexual assault in the military.
Blankenship said she crafted
her..piece to raise awareness
about sexual violence in the
military.
"I thought the subject would
be really relevant," she said.
"It's not something that gets
enough spotlight, so I thought
it was a great opportunity to
highlight sexualized violence
in the military and kind of a
nod towards servicemen and
women."
LSA junior Ashley Rose, a
member of SAPAC, said The
Clothesline Project was one of
her favorite parts of the exhib-
it. She said the association of
clothing with identity really
made the message of the project
effective.
"When you wear clothing,
you wear clothing of a cer-
tain type and it's sort of who
you are," Rose said. "Just see-
ing these t-shirts and all these
words that are on it is just part
of so many personal experi-
ences, something that they've
gone through and contributed
to who they are."
Engineering freshman
Michael McGahren-Clemens,
a member of SAPAC's Men's
Activism Program, said the
exhibit was powerful in how it
strove to make issues of sexual
violence and assault more con-
spicuous and relevant.
"It really takes an issue that's
somewhat seen as taboo and
brings it out to the open and
makes people more aware."

Festival produced
with less University,
city funding than
in years past
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
A few feet away from the
street-side cafe tables on Main
Street, throngs of colorful
papier-mache puppets and per-
formers entertained a crowd of
onlookers tapping along to echo-
ing drumbeats.
While FestiFools has been
a prime example of public arts
engagement in Ann Arbor since
2006, Sunday's parade and Fri-
day's FoolMoon festival were
produced with less University
support than in previous years.
Arriving to Main Street on the
heels of last November's failed
Public Arts Millage, arts fund-
ing in Ann Arbor and at the
University continue to spur dis-
cussion.
Marjorie Horton, assistant
dean for undergraduate educa-
tion, said University funds have
notbeen available to sponsor the
FestiFools event itself since the
2011-2012 academic year. How-
ever, LSA continues to sponsor
Art in Public Spaces, the Univer-
sity course that produces much
of the content for the festival
and parade. The college contin-
ues to fund the course's instruc-
tor, studio space and storage of
puppets.
In the course, undergradu-
ate students are immersed in
public art, including the cre-
ation of FestiFools puppets.
Additionally, students in the
course have created murals in
campus buildings, such as the
evolution-themed mural in the
Undergraduate Science Build-
ing produced for the LSA theme
semester on evolution in 2006.
Students have also participated
in set design and construction
for public theater productions
such as the Burns Park Players.
While LSA no longer funds
the actual parade and festival.
Through the Lloyd Hall Schol-
ars Program, in collaboration
with the School of Art & Design
and University Housing, two
expert puppet-makers from
New York City came to campus
to work with the students.
Lloyd Hall Scholars Pro-
gram lecturer Mark Tucker,
the founder of FestiFools and
instructor of Art in Public
Spaces, said for 2013 a group of
supportive citizens formed the
non-profit WonderFool Pro-
ductions to cover the signifi-
cant costs of putting on a town
event.
While taking their puppets
for a test run outside South Quad
Residence Hall on Thursday,
LSA sophomores Chene Karega
and Alana Weiss Nydorf said it's
important for both the Univer-
sity and the city of Ann Arbor to
sponsor public arts events such
as FestiFools.
"I think it is important for
the University to be sponsoring
events like this," Karega said.
"It makes us happy; it makes
others happy. Arts are impor-
tant."
"This is one of those parades

and get-togethers that is really
representative of what Ann
Arbor is all about," Weiss
Nydorf said. "It's totally fool-
ish, but at the same time there's
a message. FestiFools is another
way for people to get to know

Ann Arbor and to publicize Ann
Arbor, so if it helps the commu-
nity that much more, then why
not fund it?"
The city also plays a role in
supporting the event, though
in a more indirect way than the
University. Tucker said the city
waives a portion of FestiFools'
event permit fees using commu-
nity-event funds, rather than
public-art funds, which are in
short supply.
Ann Arbor City Council
member Sabra Briere (D-Ward
1) said most members of the
council would be pleased
if they could find a way to
financially support public art
opportunities, but so far the
city has not found an effective
approach.
"The city doesn't have a civic
theater or civic art space. While
some of us would support such
an idea in theory, I don't know
anyone in local government
that would make this more of
a priority than fixing streets
and sidewalks or hiring more
police," Briere said. "I hate to
weigh such things and deter-
mine that one is more impor-
tant than another."
Briere said if the city could
find a creative solution for find-
ing sufficient funding for per-
formance art, she would be
"delighted" to support the pro-
posal.
"FestiFools and FoolMoon
help create that unique charac-
ter and interest that any com-
munity would seek," Briere said.
As the chair of the council's
taskforce on public art, Briere is
no stranger to these types of dis-
cussions. Though performance-
based art funding, such as that
for FestiFools, has not been a
part of the conversation, Ann
Arbor has heard much debate
over funding for art installa-
tion projects over the past few
months.
At a City Council meeting on
April 1, Briere asked the coun-
cil to extend the temporary
halt on public arts funding
until May, which was origi-
nally set to expire in April.
This discussion came after the
failure of a public arts millage,
which was defeated by voters
during the November election.
It would have provided specif-
ic funds for public art installa-
tion projects such as murals or
sculptures. Under the current
funding method, certain capi-
tal development projects must
devote one percent of their
funds to public art installa-
tion.
At the meeting, Briere said
the extension would allow city
officials more time to compose
a revised approach to funding
public art in light of the mill-
age's defeat.
"Public art is one of many
indicators of a creative and
vibrant community," Briere said.
"Cities that care about the qual-
ity-of-life issues - like diverse
downtowns, great parks, safe
neighborhoods and public art
- attract great people to share
those benefits. And great people
bring their imagination and cre-
ativity, making all of us enjoy
living here more. Some folks
look at the economic health of
communities and see public art
as a factor in creating a healthy
economy."

Ann Arbor resident Monte
Fowler said public arts events
are important because of the
community atmosphere they
add to Ann Arbor.

"I like to have a hell of a good
time and it affords me the pos-
sibility to walk around and see
lots of people I know," Fowler
said.
While Ann Arbor residents
seem to agree on the unique fla-
vor FestiFools brings to Main
Street, they disagree on whether
or not the city should play a role
in funding the event.
Seated on a cement planter
beside the parade route, Ann
Arbor resident Colleen Rether-
ford said although she loves the
event after a long winter, it is
better off remaining financially
separate from the city.
"I think as soon as the city
gets involved in things, it gets
pretty bureaucratic," she said.
In contrast, Sociology Lec-
turer PJ McGann, an Ann Arbor
resident, said the city should
fund FestiFools and similar
events.
"It's an important part of
community life and community
identity in Ann Arbor."
Deb Mexicotte, program
coordinator of Arts at Michigan,
said co-curricular endeavors -
such as the Art in Public Spaces
class and FestiFools - often
grow out of University classes.
Once the event or initiative is
launched and has the ability to
be self-supporting, the Univer-
sity often decreases its level of
support. Mexicotte also said the
University's current interests
also play a role in funding deci-
sions, which can fluctuate based
on the missions of new initia-
tives.
Mexicotte emphasized
the University's strong com-
mitment to community arts
engagement. She said programs
such as Passport to the Arts,
which provides student passes
to enjoy on-campus cultural
events such as plays or concerts,
as well as the University Musi-
cal Society and the University
of Michigan Museum of Art
have a strong public responsi-
bility to serve the campus and
community.
UMMA director Joseph Rosa
said the University's art muse-
um plays a particularly promi-
nent role in Ann Arbor arts
engagement.
The museum, which does
most of its own fundraising and
receives a small portion from
the University's general fund,
often sponsors museum Stu-
dent Late Nights, which offer
arts-related activities to stu-
dents. The most recent event
drew nearly 1,100 people, Rosa
said.
"The building becomes a
backdrop to the experience of
art and art culture," Rosa said.
"For students, we want the
museum to be a backdrop for
everyday life. When they move
to new cities, they should join
the local museum and make it
part of their world."
From late-night oil paint-
ing observations in the UMMA
rotunda to a sun-streamed
puppet parade route on Main
Street, public arts discussions
in Ann Arbor continue.
"These kinds of discussions
never go away because public
art is so important," Mexi-
cotte said. "They wax and they
wane depending on where the
funding is or where the pub-
lic interest is. There is always

a role for the University, for
the city, for the state, for the
federal government, for these
public entities to have this
conversation."

School of Nursing celebrates

New addition
nned to partially
pen in fall 2015
By MICHELLE
GILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter

The ground-breaking cer-
emony for a new addition to the
School of Nursing building was a
day-long celebration that includ-
ed everything from lectures to a
"Nursing's Got Talent" show.
Faculty members, students,
alumni, Nursing School Dean
Kathleen Potempa and Universi-
ty President Mary Sue Coleman
all joined in the ceremony.
The new space is not a com-
plete move from the current
building, but rather an addition
to the school. The administra-
tion hopes the building will be
open for at least a portion of the
fall 2015 semester.
The nearly 75,000-square-
footbuildingwillbebuiltfor $50
million in the current parking
area on the corner of Kingsley
Street and Cornwell Plaza. Mary
Beth Lewis, the school's com-
munications manager, said the
new name might be slightly dif-
ferent than the rest of the North
Ingalls School of Nursing build-
ings. The current working name
is "The Kingsley Building."
During the ground-breaking,
Coleman, Potempa, University
Provost Phil Hanlon and Regent
Julia Darlow, among others,
spoke highlyofthe newaddition
and the importance of nursing.
"Nursing is an extremely
important part of the whole
health care team of the future,"
Coleman said in an interview
aftertheevent."Ibelieve thatas
health care reform takes place,
the role of nursing is going to
become even more important
than it is today."
"I am just very, very pleased
that we have such a highly
rankedschoolofnursingand that
we have so many different pro-
gramswithin nursingthatyoung
people canpursue," she added.
Although the reconstruc-
tion of the Kingsley parking lot
means that about 125 faculty
members will lose a parking
spot, the instructors don't seem
to mind. While the new tech-
nology and bigger classrooms
are beneficial, student excite-
ment makes faculty members

enthusiastic about the addition.
"It just isn't effective teach-
ing to just lecture at (students),"'
Nursing Assistant Prof. Donna
Marvicsin said. "We call it
'Death by PowerPoint.' So being
able to have the classrooms -
the set-up with the tables and
the technology - they can take
an application and discuss a case
study is just so exciting for the
students, and therefore for us."
The nursing faculty looks
forward to students' being able
to learn and interact with each
other while using the new tech-
nology. Since the current build-
ing was a former hospital and
children's center, the classrooms
are not as accessible as the pro-
fessors would like.
Nursing School Director
Janet Larson is looking forward
to additional space and lecture

halls forlargegroups of students.
"Our classrooms rightnow are
minimally functional," Larson
said. "They're very challenging.
This is going to be a building of
classrooms with the state-of-
the-art ability to have large lec-
ture sessions and then break up
into small groups, have as much
technology as you want to, it's
just terrific."
The addition will consist of a
lecture hall, handicap accessi-
bility, six simulation rooms and
four standard patient rooms,
among other amenities. There
is a possibility that the school's
current building will be used
for seminars if needed, though
it will mainly be used for fac-
ulty and administration offices
while the more advanced addi-
tion to the building will be used
for classes.

A city in its own right
Downtown revitalization should be a priority for Ann Arbor
L ast week the Ann Arbor City Council voted 7-3 on a city ordi-
nance designed to place new limitations on the Downtown
Development Authority. The DDA, an arm of the city govern-
ment tasked with improving the downtown area, is seeing a potential
re-appropriation of approximately $1 million on projected tax revenues
of nearly $4 million. With Ann Arbor's downtown booming financially
and projected growth continuing to rise, the DDA is in a position to
see its revenue significantly increase. Many city leaders say this isn't
necessary, arguing that the revenue could be put to better use outside
the downtown area. As all city ordinance changes require two separate
votes, the City Council should rethink what is truly at stake and reverse
its initial decision. The City Council should not redirect this revenue
from the DDA to the detriment of downtown Ann Arbor.

Fun?It'll costya'

The DDA shouldn't be penalized for doing
its job, let alone for doing it well. Of the total
taxes collected within the DDA district in 2011,
only 17 percent was allocated to the DDA itself.
Ann Arbor public schools and the city of Ann
Arbor took the lion's share, together appropri-
ating nearly 50 percent of all downtown tax
disbursements. The city government wanting
to acquire more revenue for its own purposes
sets an uneasy precedent. "Excesses" shouldn't
be diverted to agencies the city deems more
worthy of the funds.
The city of Ann Arbor is clearly making an
effort to become more of a city than a suburb.
with the development of new high rises, the
addition of several new businesses and many
innovative transportation initiatives, Ann
Arbor has progressively gone from a quirky
quasi-suburb of Detroit to a city in its own right
- in part due to the work of the DDA. From the

streamlining of parking services to the promo-
tion of community involvement, downtown has
become a place to visit.
Similarly, the revitalization of downtown has
helped spark the growth of Ann Arbor itself.
Downtown should not merely be considered
by the City Council as a zone whose taxes are
dispersed in a certain way, but as an entity that
helps define and catalyze the character of Ann
Arbor as a whole. To jeopardize this in order to
divert an additional $1 million in taxes to other
agencies - a mere 1.2 percent of the city's pro-
jected revenues - is a disservice to both the city
and to those who reside within it.
Ultimately this decision will reflect where
the priorities of the city's leaders lie. Though
the city government of Ann Arbor may benefit
in the short term from an additional stream of
revenue, it will be at the expense of both the
DDA and downtown in the long term.

h, finals week. With it
comes crowded libraries,
sleep-deprived kids and
those therapeu-
tic dogs we pet to
relieve stress. As
always, Counsel-
ing and Psycho-
logical Services
and the Univer-
sity willbe in
full force trying JAMES
to help balance BRENNAN
our stress, even
bringing out
massage chairs
for us. While there's a large focus
on resources to relieve our stress,
no one seems to be asking about the
negative effects of getting stressed
out in the first place.
I think it goes without saying that
stress is a major detriment to one's
health. Physically, it can contribute
to heart problems, headaches and
high blood pressure, among other
issues. Even worse are the effects of
stress on mental health, which can
contribute to anxiety and depres-
sion. In fact, lifelong mental illness
is considered to be largely contin-
gent on high levels of stress in a
person's life.
In October, The New York Times
published a profile of a small island
in Greece called Ikaria, famous for
its residents' excellent health and
long lives. The article attempts to
explain exactly what it is about
Ikaria that is so good for human
health by looking into the average
Ikarian's lifestyle. According to the
article, people in Greek islands typ-
ically eat a Mediterranean diet with
lots of organic vegetables, olive oil,
and honey, and very little dairy or
meat; sleep over eight hours every
night; drink two to four glasses of'
wine per day and walk essentially
everywhere. Furthermore, they
spend much of their day outdoors,

avoid white flour and refined sugar
and have sex regularly.
The people of Ikaria live very
simply, with few cares, worries
or sources of stress. In almost all
aspects, students at a school like
Michigan have a lifestyle that is
completely at odds with the interest
of their long-term health.
Many of us eat food that's simply
terrible for us, sleep only a few hours
most nights, spend a great deal of our
time being stressed about the future,
and - yes, I'm going here - drink
and use drugs in horrific amounts.
We can exercise, pet dogs and talk
to people at CAPS during finals week
all we want, but our long-term health
problems won't just go away. The
food will still poison our bodies and
the stress will still eat away at our
mental health.
In some instances, we make
choices that sacrifice our health
for our enjoyment. If someone
was willing to give up a few years
of their life to be able to eat what-
ever they want, then that's fine.
The same goes for smoking, drink-
ing, using drugs and living with
the stress of school or a job. We all
make trade-offs - as comedian Bill
Maher is fond of saying, "Fun costs
ya'." However, that doesn't mean
we should just do what we want all
the time. Good health is an under-
valued commodity and something
we believe comes from doctors and
medication. The best medicine isn't
something a doctor and pharma-
cist doles out - the best medicine
is self-prescribed, and it certainly
doesn't require good insurance.
Recent studies have increasingly
suggested that a diet with less meat
and dairy does wonders for ones
physical and mental health, while
the same results come from a good
night's sleep and lower levels of
stress. Incorporating these adjust-
ments into a daily routine could

significantly improve a person's
long-term health.
At this critical junction in our
lives, when many of us decide on a
path that may end up as our personal
norm for decades, we need to also
consider how to manage our health
in the long run. If you take the dream
job that pays six figures but requires
sixty-plus hours a week, what will
the rest of your life look like? Con-
sider how often you'll be eating fast
food, how much you'll sleep and how
much time you'll spend emotion-
ally drained from stress. For some
individuals that's all a part of their
dream, and they'll gladly make the
sacrifice. Many students that work
hard enough to get into the Univer-
sity and succeed here probably want
that life to some extent. The question
is, is it worth it?
As much as they
drive us, our
ambitions may very
well be our downfall.
Our ambitions and dreams, as
much as they drive us, may very well
be our downfall. As we continue to
sacrifice more just to get ahead, we're
essentially setting ourselves up for
a Faustian bargain. We might get
what we want - the grades, the job
or acceptance to graduate school -
but lose ourselves as we do it. I want
to live a long life, and I want to be
healthy and happyforthe durationof
it. If that means giving up the corner
office, I guess that's a sacrifice I just
have tobe willing to make.
Maybe.

Dirty polluters, dirty investments

On April 3, hundreds of students passing
through the Diag saw a lawn staked with
orange flags and saw statements provided by
over half of the Divest and Invest Coalition's
partner groups. This was the first event put
on by the Divest and Invest campaign aimed
at educatingthe greater University communi-
ty, rather than just interested students, about
why divestment from fossil fuels is the right
action for our university to take in the fight
against climate change.
The goal of the Divest and Invest campaign
is for the University to disclose and divest
all of the nearly $8-billion endowment's
almost $1 billion that's invested in the fossil
fuel industry - hence the orange flags, each
representing $1 million of our endowment
invested - and then to reinvest in environ-
mentally, socially and economically respon-
sible companies. Part of a national movement,
we of the Divest and Invest campaign and the
national divestment movement acknowledge
that the fossil fuel industry will not be hurt
by universities' divestment. We aim to change
the national attitude toward fossil fuels and
the political climate surrounding them. If
enough people acknowledge that the only
way to combat climate change is to target the
fossil fuel industry - by far the biggest con-
tributor to our Earth's destruction - then
politicians will stop accepting massive dona-
tions from the fossil fuel industry and start
voting in favor of the climate.
You're probably all sick of hearing about
how climate change is destroying the Earth's
ecosystems and environment. But, some-
thingthat is less widely understood is climate
change's affect on humans. It's obvious that
humans will be greatly affected if our air is
so polluted that we can't breathe. But what I
want to explain is how climate change is also
a human rights and social justice issue.
If you grew up in an affluent community,
chances are there wasn't a coal-fired power
plant or an oil refinery in your backyard. What
do you think would happen if one of these
were proposed to be built near your house?

Dirty polluters that would make you, your
family and your neighbors sick are very rarely
found in middle to upper-class zip codes, but
they're all too common in places where resi-
dents don't have the resources (i.e. money)
to fight back. These dirty energy facilities
are located in areas comprised primarily by
minorities, and in communities with limited
access to hospitals or healthcare. Residents of
cities like Detroit, which has the largest trash
incinerator in the world, suffer higher rates
of asthma, heart problems, hypertension,
cancer, neurological disorders and diabetes
than residents of communities without large
sources of pollution.
When social justice meets environmen-
talism, you get environmental justice. Envi-
ronmental justice activists aim to fight back
against dirty-energy facilities in low-income
communities, and they aim to shed light on
the fact that those of us in the western world
- mainly Americans - use 99 percent of the
energy that causes climate change, but are
currently only receiving1 percent of the nega-
tive affects. In countries like Bangladesh and
Myanmar, coastal residents are being forced
to move inland due to rising sea levels. People
are forced to leave their homes, where their
families have lived for hundreds of years, and
migrate to less favorable conditions inland.
These are just a few of countless cases
where human beings are being mistreated
and negatively affected by the destruction of
our Earth. This is why the Divest and Invest
campaign has partnered with organizations
like Human Rights Through Education,
United Students Against Sweatshops and
Students for Choice. The movement against
fossil fuels is about much more than lowering
the rising sea levels and making sure winter
sticks around. It's about the people who we
share our Earth with. Whether or not you feel
a connection toward nature, we can all agree
that every human has the right to stay in their
homes and breathe clean air.

The recent drama surround-
ing the Central Student Gov-
ernment elections has made
alot of people,
includingme,
lose faith in the
campaign prom-
ises we may have
voted for. With
student politi-
cians only seem-
ing to care about,
well, politics, it HEMA
isn't clear what KARUNA-
improvements, if KAlAM
any, might actu-
ally be made on
this campus. And what about the 76
percent of students who didn't even
vote in these elections? For many,
there's uncertainty about how cam-
pus can be safer and more comfort-
able for everyone.
But, here's the secret I've slowly
discovered over the past few semes-
ters here: we shouldn't have to look
toward any student organizations,
CSG or otherwise, to speak up for
us. Sure, groups standing in soli-
darity may achieve greater goals in
the long run than an individual. But
that doesn't mean one person can't
take a small step in the right direc-
tion by themselves.
Two weeks ago, I wrote a column
about the low-quality food that I
and many others on campus have
encountered in the University din-
ing halls. In addition to my column,
I also sent in a formal complaint via

the online dining feedback system.
Within one week, my inbox con-
tained personal apologies from the
manager of South Quad Residence
Hall's dining hall, the associate
vice president of the University's
Division of Student Affairs and the
senior associate director of Univer-
sity Housing. The latter invited me
to meet in person in the next week
to discuss concerns and sugges-
tions I have.
I'm not any kind of specialist in
dining, nor am I any sort of serial
activist that routinely takes on such
pet projects. I'm just a student that
has used two particular privileges:
providing feedback to University
dining and submitting an article to
this newspaper. So why am I hearing
back from so many administrators
and being asked to help make chang-
es with the problems I've observed?
Because I've taken advantage of
these privileges - resources that,
in fact, every student on this cam-
pus has. What holds so many people
back from speaking up about things
on this campus that they don't like?
It's true that not every concern
falls upon ears that want to lis-
ten. I've seen plenty of students
struggle with serious issues such
as financial aid and racial profil-
ing whose complaints haven't been
properly addressed by adminis-
trators. But there are just as many
students, if not more, who whine to
their friends instead of anyone who
could actually help. One of the best

things about this university is that
for nearly every problem there are
a multitude of resources to reach
out to.
In light of recent events, for
many, student government may no
longer be one of those resources.
But plenty of other resources are
just a quick Google search away.
If you want change
on campus, you
have to ask for
it yourself.
There's always someone to talk
to. If you don't feel close enough
to your residential advisor or you
find your professor intimidating or
you aren't sure who your student
government representatives are,
there's someone out there who can
help you that is just a phone call or
e-mail away. You don't have to fall
in the trap of failed political cam-
paigns and broken promises for
campus improvement to feel like
you are being heard. We shouldn't
need to rely on anyone else to speak
for us - if you want to see a change,
ask for it yourself.

GLORY
From Page 1A
in protecting the ball, committing
just 9.4 turnovers per game.
"We have two great point
guards, Spike (Albrecht) and Trey
(Burke), and they will be ready to
handle that press," said freshman
forward Glenn Robinson III. "It's
just important for us to get them
outlets and flash in the middle
when they need it. Just try to
limit our turnovers."
So the matchup to look for will
be in the backcourt. The Car-
dinals' duo of Peyton Siva and
Russ Smith have held opposing
guards - like Duke's Seth Curry
and Wichita State's Malcolm
Armstead - to single-digit scor-
ing while exploding for 20-plus
points of their own.
Burke hasn't put up the num-
bers that he's capable of in recent
games - the sophomore had just
seven points on Saturday against
Syracuse and took a backseat in
the offense in the second half of

the Wolverines' Elite Eight game
against Florida - but Michigan
isn't concerned if Burke isn't scor-
ing like he's used to.
Junior guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. noted that playing in the Big
Ten has prepared the Wolver-
ines for situations where Burke
is faced with tough backcourt
defense or a cold shooting night.
"It helps when you have guards
and wings in the Big Ten that play
defense like they do," Hardaway
said. "(Ohio State junior) Aaron
Craft and (Indiana junior) Vic-
tor Oladipo, for example, they do
a great job just getting to you and
try to make you turnthe ball over."
And it will also be a physi-
cal matchup in the post. Fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary is
arguably the hottest player in
the tournament right now, aver-
aging 16 points and 11 rebounds
per game while shooting 70-per-
cent clip. He's battled past Kan-
sas' Jeffy Withey and helped the
Wolverines crack Syracuse's zone
with hismid-range jump shot and
team-high six assists.

He's matched up against
Louisville's Gorgui Dieng, who
struggled against Wichita State's
lanky, rebound-happy forwards
and didn't score a point. Though
Dieng has much more experience
against strong, physical forwards,
McGary has shown immense
improvement over the course of
the tournament, which Pitino
thinks has made him "one of the
premiere big guys in our country."
"I have a lot of respect for
him," Dieng said. "He's a good
basketball player. If it gets to the
point that experience is gong to
separate us, I am willing to do my
best to stop him and protect the
paint."
But no matter the matchup or
advantage either team could have,
the players are just looking for-
ward to playing their last 40 min-
utes of basketball of the season.
"It's going to be a hard-fought
40 minutes," Burke said. "There's
going to be skill involved in the
matchup, but alot of it is going to
be desire and will. It will come
down to a battle of will"

"Yet here they are and have

said.
Public Policy senior Alexander
Lane, the communications direc-
tor of forUM, expressed concern
that Osborn and Sakwa's disqual-
ification will incentivize parties
to view hearings in the UEC as a
means of electoral victory.
"In future years this will set

responsibility of those in atten-

resource and support system for
someone in pain.
"I survived ... I had Michigan;
I had friends and family who
loved me no matter who I was,"
Armstrong said. "But not all kids
get to be at the University of
Michigan."
LSA junior Dominique
Brooks, one of the student
organizers for the event, said
the University's TEDx event -
despite its short lifetime - is
one of the best known in the
country and often acts as prece-
dent for the conference on other
campuses.
"It has a lot to do with our
innovation," Brooks said. "We've
really taken it to the next step; we
defy a lot of thought about what
college kids would do."
LSA junior Amanda Sena,
another of the event's organiz-
ers, said TEDxUofM is a leader
around the country not only
because of the diverse speakers
it attracts, but also because of
the clear innovation in the other
aspects of the conference.
"We try to really put a lot of
thought into the design," Sena
said. "I think putting so much
effort into one event like this real-
ly makes it something."

is uncouth and bad about poli-
tics, then at least at the moment
I think that they are in for a lot
more of it."
Proppe couldn't estimate
exactly how much he thought
Osborn's influencing of voters
affected the election.
"I think Chris and Hayley and
forUM ran a great campaign, but
I do think they were significantly
more aggressive in the libraries
and the Fishbowl than we were,"
Proppe said.
While the two photographs
used as evidence were taken of
Osborn in multiple locations,
Proppe said no members of you-
MICH were following Osborn.

He did acknowledge, however,
that there was "hearsay" that
members of forUM had been
approaching students around
campus and not leaving them
until the students had voted.
"On the first day we got wind
that forUM was being pretty
aggressive in the libraries,"
Proppe said. "So there were
(party members) that said, 'OK,
if you see somebody from forUM
going through the fishbowl and
they look like they're playing
dirty, make sure to document it."
Proppe pointed out that ear-
lier in the election, youMICH
had informed momentUM that
members of that party had been

placing flyers that contradicted
election rules, but no complaints
were filed.
The party didn't inform
Osborn or forUM of the infrac-
tions it documented, but rather
took pictures of Osborn at multi-
ple locations before filing a com-
plaint against him.
Proppe said he was not made
aware of the pictures until after
the complaint had been filed.
Still, he said the goal of the
complaints was not to disqualify,
but to set the proper precedent.
"I'm glad we filed the case,"
Proppe said. "I think it's impor-
tant to uphold those rules that
are written in the code."

pajama party, adaptive sports
day and a charity ball all led up
to the marathon.
Ann Arbor T-shirt Company,
one of the event's sponsors, pro-
vided shirts at a discounted rate,
and the University's Information
Technology Services, another
sponsor, donated computers to
be used at the event.
In preparation for the mara-
thon, dancers were told to wean
themselves off caffeine and stay
hydrated. To keep everyone
entertained during the mara-
thon, five meals were served,
crafting activities were provided
and massages and stretching
machines kept participants on
their feet.
On Sunday afternoon, Inje-
jikian's longtime friend Colin
Northrup, who has benefitted
from DMUM for 14 years, gave
a speech thanking all of the par-
ticipants.
"I have the confidence to
stand up for myself and what
I need, and that started here,"
Northrup said.
Luke Bromberg, a teenage
member of one of Dance Mara-
thon's Alumni Families who
has benefitted from the funds

raised by Dance Marathon for
the past 12 years, said he made
a lot of friends by going to the
Dance Marathon-sponsored
events.
Although LSA freshmen Ken-
dall Gordon, Emily Greenberg
and Hilary Forrest said they
were nervous about standing for
30 hours, they signed up with
other girls from the University's
chapter of Delta Phi Epsilon
sorority because they wanted to
make a difference.
LSA graduate Vikram Sarma
participated in the very first
University Dance Marathon in
1998, and returned to the event
Sunday to show his support.
Sarma said a lot has changed
since he participated in the '90s.
Dance Marathon used to take up
the space of a third of the Indoor
Track and Field building with
about 77 dancers, while in recent
years the event has expanded to
fill the entire building. Sarma
also said the program has added
events throughout the year to
encourage students to get to
know the families on whom they
are having an impact.
"It's a year-long effort; this is
just a culmination," Sarma said.
"But the spirit of the students,
the tenacity of the dancers and
the warm hearts of the families
stays the same."

REACTION ON THE DIAG

Mike Barwis, former director of strength and conditioning for the Athletic Department, speaks at the TEDxUofM on Friday.

Sena said the interest in TED-
talks stems from the diversity of
the people on campus and their
interests inside and outside of the
classroom.
"I think TED - what attracts
us to it - is just the opportunity to
explore a lot of different interests
other than what we're studying
ourselves," she said.
TEDxUofM also allows cur-
rent students to give speeches.
This year, LSA senior Michael
Williams, a Detroit native, gave
a presentation on the future of
his home city and the untapped
potential of its people.
In the Unleashed session,
Mike Barwis, former director

Both had been paralyzed but can

Se regonalMEN'S GYMNASS
Michigan captures rgoa crown 'M' eeks

By CINDY YU
Daily Sports Writer
After a disappointing second-
place finish to Nebraska at the Big
Ten Championships two weeks
ago, the No. 5 Michigan women's
gymnastics team approached the
NCAA Regionals with a differ-
ent mentality. Centered on posi-
tivity rather than pressure, the
Wolverines won their 10th NCAA
Regional Championship at the
WVU Coliseum in Morgantown,
W. Va. on Saturday night.
"We had so much fun out
there," said senior Brittnee Mar-
tinez. "We just wanted to have
fun - not forced fun - and just
enjoy the experience. I think that
type of thinking definitely helped
us today."
Under strict judging, Michigan
(17-2 Big Ten, 29-2 overall) scored
a 196.725 to top the standings and
qualify for the NCAA Champi-
onships. Senior Katie Zurales
and junior Joanna Sampson, the
captains of the Michigan squad
who qualified individually for the
NCAA Championships, will have
the rest of the Wolverines along-
side them this year. No. 17 Illinois
upset No. 8 Nebraska, 196.025-
195.875, for the second automatic
berth to the championships.
SeededNo. Iintheregional,the
Wolverines competed in Olympic
order. Beginning on vault, every
gymnast scored a 9.800 or higher
to tally a 49.200 total score. Zura-
les and freshman Austin Shep-
pard led the team, each scoring
9.875 for an explosive Yurchenko
full with only the slightest foot
shuffle on the landing.

competed in the anchor position,
arguably the highest-pressure
spot on beam, and scored a 9.725
to prevent the team from count-
ing a fall.
Prior to the final rotation,
Michigan led the team stand-
ings with a 147.625, followed by
Illinois and Nebraska battling
for second with scores of 146.850
and 146.225, respectively. Illinois
closed out the meet on beam, the
toughest event to hit under pres-
sure, while Michigan and Nebras-
ka would finish on its best events,
floor andvault, respectively.
Beilstein, Sugiyama and junior
Reema Zakharia scored 9.875s
for their energetic performances
to tie for second on floor. The
team score of 49.100 was enough
to maintain Michigan's lead
throughout all four events.
Nebraska recorded the high-
est event total of the night on
any event with a 49.650 on vault.
Despite a stellar rotation that
marked the Cornhuskers' best
NCAA postseason score in pro-
gram history, it wasn't enough to
surpass Illinois, which scored a
49.175, the highest beam total of
the night.
"It's a great feeling to be going
back to nationals," said Michigan
coach Bev Plocki. "We felt like we
should have been there last year
and just came up an eyelash short
so I think in a lot of ways, this
regional meet is the toughest. If
you don't have a good meet, you're
staying at home.
"We still have little things to
clean up. We have yet to have our
perfect meet. Hopefully that's in
the stars and we'll have that in
Los Angeles."

Senior captain Katie Zurales celebrates a stuck uneven-bars landing earlier in the season.

bye, Michigan moved to uneven
bars, where Martinez and Samp-
son scored identical 9.900s to take
top honors for their near-flawless
routines, highlighted by sky-high
Tkatchevs and stuck double lay-
out dismounts.
"I was actually nervous to go,
but I embraced the feeling," Mar-
tinez said. "After I got started, I
just went on autopilot."
The other four Wolverines
scored at or above a 9.850 on bars
- all six competitors placed in
the top three on the event. Sopho-
more Sachi Sugivama scored a

two previous meets. Zurales, a
consistent all-around competitor,
didn't compete on bars to rest her
elbow she tweaked at Big Tens.
At the halfway point, Michi-
gan led with a 98.575, followed by
Illinois, Kentucky and Nebraska
with scores of 97.925, 97.800 and
97.400, respectively.
On beam, the pressure was on
from the very beginning after
Gies fell on her flight series in the
lead-off position. The rest of the
team competed with the same
consistency it has had all season,
hitting its routines. Sophomore

best 9.875 with her wobble-free
routine highlighted by a stuck
roundoff double full to finish sec-
ond on beam. Zurales performed
a unique side aerial to backhand-
spring flight series as well as a
perfect beat to sheep jump, scor-
ing a 9.900 and tying Illinois
senior Alina Weinstein for the
event title.
"For beam, we always talk
about not letting any outside fac-
tors affect your routines," Zurales
said. "I think every one of us did a
good job of that, and everyone did
exactly what she needed to do."

out Big
Ten title
Mikulak named
Gymnast of the
Year, Golder Coach
of the Year 0
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan's historic season
continued this weekend when
the men's gymnastics team cap-
tured the Big Ten title on center
stage Friday and Saturday night.
Friday night was the team and
all-around competition, in which
the third-ranked Wolverines cap-
tured the Big Ten title. Michigan
(7-1 Big Ten, 17-2 overall) edged
out No. 1 Penn State, 438.900-
434.050 in the team competition,
while Minnesota grabbed third.
In the individual competi-
tion on Saturday, the Wolverines
qualified for 18 of the 60 individ-
ual spots, the most of any team
and claimed three individual
titles.
"The team competition on
Friday went really well," said
sophomore Stacey Ervin. "We
started off on pommel horse and
went 5-for-5, so we got a lot of
our momentum (there), and that
really stayed with us for the rest
of the competition.
"On Saturday, we just had that
momentum from Friday that
translated into our strong indi-
vidual performances, and after
coming off such a good feeling
(on Friday) we just wanted to
keep it going."
Senior Syque Caesar cap-
tured his second career Big Ten
parallel bar title with a score of
15.025. Ervin won his first Big
Ten title on floor with a score of
15.800. Junior Sam Mikulak won
his third straight high bar title
with a score of 15.700. All three
gymnasts, along with sophomore
Adrian de Los Angeles, were
named to the first team All-Big
Ten squad.
In addition, Mikulak was
crowned Big Ten Gymnast of
the Year, and Michigan coach
Kurt Golder was awarded Big
Ten Coach of the Year. Miku-
lak's award was the second of
his career - he earned his first
after his freshman year. Golder's
award was the third of his career.
"I think Friday was a huge
energy high," Mikulak said. "The
team (was) pumping everyone up
to go out there and perform. That
led to everyone just hitting sets.
It just felt easy out there."
Mikulak won Friday's all-
around competition with a score
of 89.850. De Los Angeles came
in second with 87.350 points for
the Wolverines. Going into the
contest, De Los Angeles was first
in the nation in the all-around
competition with a four-event
average of 88.683.
In addition to its all-around
success, Michigan hit a season-
best team score of 75.65 on vault
where four Wolverines advanced
on Saturday. The highlightofFri-
day night, however, was Miku-
lak's NCAA record-setting 15.95

on the parallel bars.
"We had a great Big Tens, and
we came home with alot of hard-
ware and of course that Big Ten
Championship trophy," Mikulak
said. "Everyone had that same
comfortable feeling all weekend,
and it really showed."
Michigan competes next at the
NCAA Championships on April
19 at Penn State. After this week-
end's performance, the Wolver-
ines will likely go into it as the
early favorites.
"We had three falls this week-
end, and if we can get rid of those,
I feel like we could be unstoppa-
ble," Mikulak said. "We just have 4
to keep healthy, make sure no one
gets hurt and that we continue
being confident in our routines."

'Road' self-indulges

Reminiscing on records
of teenage nostalgia

Cinematography
drives otherwise
meaningless film
By NATALIE GADBOIS
DailyArts Writer
"With the coming of Dean
Moriarty began the part of my
life you could call my life 'on the
road."'"
With those B
iconic words,
spoken in a On the Road
scratchy drawl At the
by protagonist
Sal Paradise, Michigan
director Wal- IFC
ter Salles ("The
Motorcycle
Diaries") begins his reverently
faithful adaptation of Jack Ker-
ouac's 1957 beatnik novel, "On
the Road." Starring Garrett Hed-
lund ("TRON: Legacy") as the
enigmatic Moriarty and British
newcomer Sam Riley ("Woman
in Love") as Paradise, his quietly
rebellious counterpart, the film
deftly encapsulates the anar-
chy and crippling freedom that
defined the Beat generation, but
falters asit becomes tangled in its
own mystique.
Paradise is a student living in
Queens who, after meeting wild
and mercurial Moriarty and his
pouty, over-sexed child bride
Marylou (Kristen Stewart, "Snow
White and the Huntsman"),
decides on a whim to hitchhike
across the country. A high-mind-
ed writer, bored and lonely in his
static life, he imparts on a search
for self-awareness or, at least,
meaning behind his discontent.
Though Riley's attempt at a
smoke-addled New York accent
is often distracting, his pilgrim-
age is where the film excels: Salles
has already proven his talent

IFC

"It's OK, we got a babysitter for Renesmee."

for portraying landscapes, and
Paradise's journey - both literal
and metaphorical - exudes the
beauty of a United States that was
more trusting and naive; a United
States in which drifters like Para-
dise formed their own hyper-
connected culture. The imagery
of the unending landscape of the
midwestis breathtaking and helps
relate the yearningthese men felt,
caught between a war and an
unknown future.
Moriarty and Paradise reunite
in Denver before once again set-
ting off on some scheme for love
and drugs, and here is where
Hedlund shines. He seamlessly
renders Moriarty's manic energy,
overt sexuality and selfish dis-
regard for the lives he affects.
Originally basedon real-life ren-
egade Neal Cassady, Moriarty is
a complex figure, and Hedlund
stands up to the task of playing
an inscrutable man. Similarly,
Stewart is at last inher element as
his whiny and unhinged partner.
Their chemistry is palpable as the
two speed fatalistically toward
their futures.
The film is studded with a
parade of periphery characters
with big names (Kirsten Dunst,

Amy Adams, Viggo Mortensen
and Steve Buscemi, to name a
few), all meant to provide dif-
fering lenses on this generation.
However, they overwhelm an
already disjointed story, and as
the names build up, this beautiful
homage to a generation crumbles.
Salles self-indulges, stuffing
the film with discordant sex
scenes and overdone symbol-
ism. His stark landscapes and
arresting main characters lose
focus. Any meaning is lost in the
(multiple) threesomes and Ben-
zedrine trips. These characters
become canvasses for tropes of
thV Beat generation, rather than
members themselves. It's as if
the film lowers in esteem every
time we see Moriarty's bare ass
or Marylou proposes a wild sex-
ual escapade.
Ratherthen definethese char-
acters and show their progres-
sion (or regression) as humans
in a world increasingly at odds
with their lifestyle, the final
third of the movie is spent show-
ing their idiosyncrasies, prov-
ing just how "crazy" and "free"
this time was. The film becomes
the endless journey they are on,
with no real plan or end in sight.

Today is one of those days

musicianship of Radiohead or
Arcade Fire.
These are the albums that
inspire a simplistic angst that,
for reasons unclear, I some-
times yearn for. They are
albums written by melodramat-
ic pretty boys who evoke within
me a slightly embarrassing adu-
lation, a form of hero worship
that I, for better or worse, can
no longer summon. And oddly
enough, a surprising amount of
these albums turn 10 in 2013.
So, as I am in a perpetual state
of sentimentality, allow me the
indulgerice of some semi-fabri-
cated nostalgia.
The year 2003 saw the release
of Fall Out Boy's Take This to
Your Grave, Branfd New's Deja
Entendu, The Format's Inter-
ventions and Lullabies, Death
Cab for Cutie's Transatlanticism
and Bright Eyes's Lifted or the
Story Is in the Soil. While I was
struggling to multiply improper
fractions and heavily immersed
in a surprisingly raunchy rap
phase, America's tender-souled-
youth were having a pretty
remarkable year.

But ultimately, Cassidy said
that what the director wants,
the director gets and that "final
word" is always a shared deci-
sion.
"If (the director) wants to

Harvey Weinstein (the film's pro-
ducer) is a great force; he's like an
old time Hollywood studio head.
He beats you and wants you to
push back because he wants to
know that the best version of this
movie has been made. And that's
the final cut."
Cassidy mentioned that
O'Russell and Robert DeNiro
(who acted in the film) each
have a child whose life has been
compromised by emotional and
behavioral issues. These real
emotional motivations behind
"Silver Linings Playbook" hooked
him onto the project.
"There's enough people who
make movies, and they're just cal-
culations," Cassidy said. "I'm not

necessarily interested in those,
but I am interested in somebody
who passionately wants to tell a
story."
Cassidy described what it was
like to work with Jennifer Law-
rence, who won the Academy
Award for Best Actress for her
performance in the film.
"On one hand, she's this grown
up, but on the other hand, she's
like a teenager talking about
surfing with her friends, and
it's like, 'Who is this person?'"
Cassidy described. "It's like an
angel came down to Louisville,
Kentucky (where Lawrence is
from). Take her out of 'The Hun-
ger Games,' and you just have a
bunch of teenagers killing teen-
agers."
At the end of event, Cassidy
left the students with one final
piece of advice.
"Stay out of show business,"
he said. "You go to Hollywood,
and you're a free agent, sure, but
freedom is just another word for
nothing left to do. You rise and
fall on luck and talent and hard
work. So, if you have certain
expectations on how your life is
going to turn out, you better fac-
tor that in."

This is what it would
have always come down
to. I could feel it, as
sweat coated my palms, that
this moment was what my life
had always
waited for. I
was casual,
nonchalant at
first. I hadn't
wanted to
show my
weakness, my
hand. ANNA
Gradually, SAIC.S"A
the anticipa-
tion started
to build. I'm sure everyone
knew - everyone could see
that I was going to lose this
battle. There's no way to win
when destiny is on the line. I
picked the two perpetrators
up, holding them side by side
as if the light could shine down
and give me a hint as to what to
do. Which one to pick. Because
in my hands, I held the most
beautiful finds of my thrift
shop exploration: "Checkpoint"
and "Gardemariny," two Rus-
sian films from my childhood.
My life had become a bad
Mackelmore song. How was -
I supposed to pick? How
can anyone pick between
something as important and
meaningful as these two dis-
coveries? I'm no native thrifter.
In fact, this was my first out- .
ing, and it was looking like
I was going to leave broken-
hearted either way.
"Por que no los dos?" My fel-
low adventurer asked, and sud-
denly, my whole world shifted.
Finding something amazing
while thrifting is like winning
a prize. Because, believe it or
not, thrifting is most certainly
an art. There's no way you can
spend four hours on a Satur-
day morning digging through
old clothes, dusty vinyls and
broken appliances without
despairing.
The best part comes at the
very beginning of each store:
You size the space, the collec-
tion of random items, brim-
ming with possibility ... and
you begin your search. Some
places are cooler than others,
and are much more inviting.
We found a working blender for
$10. Magic.
But toward the middle of the
shopping experience, some-
thing slightly terrifying begins
to occur. Islowly started fall-

ing asleep while standing, as
the fourth store we visited
blurred by. Everything looked
the same - I was even bored of
the grandmother sweaters.
And then, like a beacon of
hope, I found the Russian mov-
ies. It was as if the thrift-shop
gods were telling me to keep
searching. And though waking
up at 8 a.m. on a Saturday was
terrible, the finds were worth
it.
Thisisn't news to most
thrifters. They scavenge the
shelves and hangers in hopes
of finding true gold within the
rubble. But despite the awesome
deals and the envious finds, the
greatest thing about thrifting is
the amazing opportunity to find
rare, old items that hold much
more value from a sentimental
point of view.
Popping tags
and saving
checks
Not limited to the experi-
ences of a 6-year-old Russian,
sentimental items are every-
where. They can creep up on
you at Value World as you flick
through books, only to stumble
upon "Memoirs of a Geisha"
with an insert that reads; "To
David, who has only brought me
hope to fill my memoirs with."
That's real life.
Novels, films, albums -
thrifting to find the finer things
in life is like opening the door
to a whole new thrift shop
adventure. No longer focusing
on the 99-cent sheets, taking
time to notice the smaller, qui-
eter things can lead to an artsy,
intriguing shopping quests.
I ended up with neither Rus-
sian film, but with good reason:
The longer I stared at the mov-
ies, the more I realized I loved
the idea of hunting more than
the result. I went on to find
crazy paintings, fun posters
and a book I've been meaning
to pick up. But the movies shall
remain a symbol - for every-
thing possible to find as long as
you remember to look.

Defending the antics and gags
of USA's crime-comedy 'Psych'
By REBECCA GODWIN

I love USA's show "Psych." I've
loved it ever since it began in 2006,
and I could barely contain my
excitement when the long-await- 4
ed seventh season finally started
back in February. But when I tried
to share my love with a group of
friends, they stared at me in con-
fusion. They, like so many other
people, had no idea what "Psych"
was, which is a complete shame -
because it's easily one-of the most
entertainingshows on TV.

"Don't Come Knocking"), whose
father, a former police officer,

Academy Award
winning artist
talks process
By CARLY KEYES
Daily Arts Writer
Having spent seven years
working in the visual effects
industry, Jon Cohen, an Acad-
emy Award winner for techni-
cal achievement, recently came
to the University to speak about
his experience in Hollywood
- everything from "Avatar" to
Jessica Alba.
Cohen graduated from Brown
University in 2000 with a degree
in Mathematics and Computer
Science, and received a fast
introduction to the media cul-
ture while looking for potential
roommates in Los Angeles.
"Every single one of them
mentioned to me that they had
a screenplay. I was like 'Oh my
God, where am I living?"'
Cohen started working at
Rhythm and Hues, a visual
effects studio known for pro-
ducing digital animals such as
the original Coca-Cola polar
bears, Scooby-Doo and Richard
Parker, the life-like tiger from
"Life of Pi."
Cohen detailed the exciting
challenge of developing techni-
cal tools that artists can use to
create the characters they've
envisioned.
"For most people who work
in these kinds of computational
sciences, the concept that you
could have this type of technol-
ogy and put it in the hands of an
artist is mind-blowing, like, how
do you even present it in a way
that makes sense?" Cohen said.
"So they've built this huge, com-
plicated set of tools alongside
the artists who've learned how
to use them. Then you can do
something like Richard Parker,
which is an amazing combina-
tion of both technology and art-
istry."
Cohen talked about how mov-
ies like "Avatar" have fostered

groundbreaking developments
in the technical world and
expanded the limits to an artist's
creative capacity.
"James Cameron says, 'I want
a giant blue thing that looks
like the actor,' and that sounds
crazy," Cohen began. "He had
this vision of what he wanted,
but the technology wasn't good
enough yet. He did three tests
over the years, (the second) one I
worked on at Rhythm and Hues
in 2001, so that was a hard prob-
lem to solve. It took 15 years and
lots of studios trying different
things until one of them figured
out how to do it at the qual-
ity that (Cameron) was happy
with."
Cohen had quite the difficult
problem to solve himself as a
technical supervisor on "Spi-
derman 3" when director Sam
Raimi said he wanted a charac-
ter made of sand.
"(Sandman) had to look real-
istic, but that doesn't make sense
because realistic sand doesn't
form into the shape of a person,"
Cohen explained. "That's the
artistic challenge: What would
it be like if sand had a mind of
its own and could form into
shapes, but was still subject to
the laws of physics? Then there's
the technical side because how
would you even simulate a tool
for an artist to control 100 bil-
lion sand grains?"
Cohen's problem-solving
skills eventually struck Oscar
gold in 2008, when he and three
team members developed soft-
ware for fluid simulation and
volumetric modeling that has
now been used on more than 50
films, including "The Chron-
icles of Riddick," "Superman
Returns" and "Happy Feet."
Cohen learned the definition
of "five-star" when he attended
the Technical Academy Awards
ceremony, which took place at
the famously upscale Beverly
Wilshire hotel, hosted by Jessica
Alba.
"There was a reporter at our
table and the wait staff spilled
a glass of wine all over him, so

they took his jacket off, whisked
it away, brought it back ten min-
utes later, dry-cleaned, pressed
and they were like, 'Here's your
jacket, sir,' " Cohen recalled.
"And I just said, 'Wow, so this is
what it's like!' We were all jok-
ing like we should all spill some
wine on each other and say, 'Hey,
will you dry-clean my suit?'"
But despite the success, near-
ly five years ago when Cohen
wrapped "Spiderman 3," he
decided to get out of the movie
business, partially for profes-
sional reasons.
"In the visual effects world
(of the film industry), the career
path up is always towards pro-
duction, like a digital effects
supervisor, and that's a total-
ly artistic world," Cohen
explained. "So for someone like
me, if you stay as a technical per-
son, writing software and tools,.
the ceiling is very low and the
career path taps out pretty early
on."
Cohen started working for
NVIDIA, a California-based
technology company, and has
been telecommuting since he
moved to Ann Arbor when his
wife gained acceptance to a Uni-
versity Ph.D. program. He cur-
rently serves as Senior Manager
of CUDA software library devel-
opment.
When asked if he'd ever con-
sidering getting "back in the
business," Cohen talked about
possibly rejoining the world
of entertainment, just not the
world of film.
"The visual effects indus-
try (in movies) is kind of dying
in the United States, and it's
not fun to work in an industry
that's shrinking, but the gaming
industry is expanding," Cohen
explained.
Whatever the future holds,
Cohen has left a legacy in the
film industry with the software
he developed, helping countless
filmmakers bring what they
imagine to the screen. And he
will always have another claim
to fame: He shook Jessica Alba's
hand.

By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
Whether or not one knows
who Jon Chu, director of "G.I.
Joe: Retaliation," is, they've
likely heard of or seen the sec-
ond and third installments of the
"Step Up" series - both works
of Chu's creation. His name is
commonly associated with the
musical genre, especially after
advancing from the "Step Up"
series to work with Justin Bieber
on his documentary "Justin
Bieber: Never Say Never."
And yet, in a recent confer-
ence call with The Michigan
Daily, Chu spilled the beans on
his surprising musical back-
ground and beginnings in film.
"You know, I just love tell-
ing stories," Chu said. "I wasn't a
dancer, I wasn't a choreographer.
And jumping into the 'Step Up'
world, I got to work with amazing
choreographers, amazing dancers
... and I just basically jumped into
the dance world."
With "G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"
Chu had to make an even loftier
leap into the big-budget action
film bandwagon. He explained
that this transition came with the
unfamiliar challenge of having
too much - special effects, pyro-
technics and the like - instead of
too little.
"One of the biggest challenges
was, I think, just the sheer enor-
mity of the production. Some-
times you have 700 people on set.
And it's hard when you are used to

smaller movies," Chu said. "I defi- - Bruce Willis ("A Good Day to

The redemption song
ofJordan Morgan

Breakdown: 'M' vs. Louisville

ATLANTA -
et's crunch this remark-
able, ridiculous and
insane season down into
one moment. Let's condense it,
split away the narratives and
plays, and find the core and
the heart of why this Michigan
men's basketball team is playing
for a national championship on
Monday night.
It comes
in one of
the auxil-
iary locker
rooms in the
underbelly of r
the Georgia
Dome, away
from the EVERETT
court and COOK
hidden from
the cameras.
Just like they do after every
win, the Wolverines elect a play-
er to lead them in "The Victors."
It's selected by the players, not
the coaches or anyone else.
On Saturday, after Michigan's
61-56 win over Syracuse, the
man leading the song played five
minutes, didn't corral a single
rebound and scored just three
points. Seven other Wolverines
scored more than he did, and

he was the only player who
saw action that didn't record a
rebound.
What Jordan Morgan did
have was a pair of charges and
a dunk that sent the Wolverines
to their first National Champi-
onship game since 1993. For a
player who started 27 games this
year, but played a combined total
of one minute in the first two
rounds of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, it was a night of redemp-
tion.
With 19 seconds left and
Michigan clinging to a two
point lead, Morgan jumped from
one side of the key to the other,
throwing his body in the path of
Syracuse guard Brandon Triche,
who was barreling down the
lane, trying to tie the game.
The play sealed the win.
After the game, the players
said the charge would go down
as the biggest offensive foul in
the history of Michiganbasket-
ball.
The Wolverines have the
National Player of the Year and
more future NBA talent than
almost any other team in the
country, but take away the high-
lights and the hype, and a charge
- the actcof being voluntarily

run over - was celebrated more
than any other play.
"That's the definition of
our team, from a guy who was
starting and was first team All-
Defense, to not playing one min-
ute - (Morgan) just stayed with
it," said senior captain Josh Bar-
telstein. "He knew he was going
to get his moment, and when you
get your chance, you make the
most of it."
Added redshirt sophomore
Jon Horford: "I don't know if
the fans understand that was the
biggestcplay of the game."
Eighteen seconds later, junior
forward Tim Hardaway Jr.
almost fell out of bounds trying
to collect a rebound. The ball
got to Morgan, who was around
midcourt. He needed only one
dribble before taking off, jam-
ming Michigan's national title
berth in with two hands.
This is someone who didn't
play a single minute in Michi-
gan's win over Virginia Com-
monwealth in the second
round of the tournament. He
was visibly frustrated after the
game, visibly frustrated about
havingto take a backseat to the
emergence of freshman forward

In week 10 of the season,
Michigan and Louisville were
each ranked in the AP Poll's top
three. Three weeks later, with
the Wolverines positioned atop
the polls, the Cardinals had fall-
en all the way to No. 12.
By time the NCAA Tourna-
ment kicked off two months later,
those roles were flipped, with
Louisville as the bracket's top
overall seed and Michigan as a
No. 4 seed, falling somewhere in

the No. 13-16 range. None of that
matters anymore, as the Wolver-
ines and Cardinals, the nation's
last two teams standing, will bat-
tle it out on Monday night for the
National Championship.
The Daily breaks down Mon-
day's matchups.
Point guard: Perhaps the only
point guard that has a real advan-
tage over sophomore Trey Burke,
Aaron Craft, willbe watching the
title game in Columbus, nearly
600 miles from Atlanta. But with
that being said, Louisville's Pey-
ton Siva is no slouch.

The senior is making his sec-
ond career Final Four appear-
ance, and despite sometimes
erratic decision making, he's
paced the Cardinals through a
grinding Big East season, leading
them to conference regular sea-
son and tournament crowns.
Burke, on the other hand,
displayed consistency like no
player anywhere in the country
on his way to being a consensus
National Player of the Year recip-
ient. But in the tournament, he's
looked less than stellar at times.

Two decades later, good night, and good luck

Twenty years and a day.
From the moment
Michigan's fabled Fab Five
stepped off the court, dejected,
in New Orleans on April 5, 1993,
almost exactlytwo decades have
passed before the Wolverines
finally fought their way back here.
Two decades when the bas-
ketball program looked back, its
unwavering focus resting only
on a pair of Final Four banners
lying dormant, abandoned in the
basement of
the Bentley
Historical
Library.
Two
decades when
pride still
rested with
those black
shoes, those STEPHEN J.-
black socks NESBITT
and those ban-
ished banners
- relics of a history shrouded in
controversy, now collecting dust.
Two decades when the pro-
gram's finest memories were
of the Fab Five: Chris Webber,
Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose,
Jimmy King and Ray Jackson.
They changed the game, you
know. They captivated a genera-
tion, shocked the world, and held
a nation in stunned disbelief when
they buckled and collapsed with
Webber's phantom fourth time-
out. They brought Ann Arbor to
life, then they watched it all end
- the spotlightfaded, the talent
pool faded and the powerhouse
basketball program that had
reached three national champion-
ship games in five years faded.
But this Michigan team has
stepped out of those shadows
and onto center stage. Suddenly,
the only reason anyone is looking
back isto compare legacies, to

remember.
And now, somehow, with one
more win over Louisville, we can
finally say good night to the Fab
Five as the face of Michigan bas-
ketball, and wish good luck to this
revived program.
Three hundred sixty-four days
ago, Trey Burke stayed.
He had a foot out the door, then
he reversed course. "Those who
stay will be champions," appar-
ently, and never has this well-
worn, clichdd statement been
truer than it is today.
"I felt like it was the best deci-
sion for me to stay my sophomore
year and compete for a national
championship next year," Burke
said that Monday, nearly a year
ago.
It was reminiscent of what
Webber, then a sophomore, told
a crowd of 2,500 at Crisler Arena
when Michigan arrived just 15
hours after its loss to North Caro-
lina in 1993, just 15 hours after the
phantom timeout.
"As I said last year, next year
we'll be back," Webber said.
"We'll be back."
He didn't stay, of course. He
left for the NBA and became
the No. 1 overall draft pick a few
months later. And, with him,
Michigan's championship hopes
seeped out the door. Elite Eight
once, Sweet 16 years later, but
never beyond over the next two
decades.
Until this year.
This team has a chance to do
what the Fab Five never could:
win a national title. It has faced
a fiercer gauntlet in this tourna-
ment than the Fab Five ever did
- in 1992, Michigan beat Nos.
11, 14,2,1, 4 and 1 seeds (average

One.
That's all that's left.
As I pen this column, a dusty
bound volume sits on either side
of me. One that holds every copy
of the Daily from the spring of
1992, the other every copy from
the spring of 1993.
Two decades later, the yel-
lowed pages still vividly replay
the heartbreak. Back-to-back
appearances in the national
championship game, and back-
to-back losses. But the pages also
- describe the elation that preceded
the losses, the elation after the
Final Four victories, the elation
that brought Ann Arbor to life.
You might know the feeling
now, because this program is cap-
tivating again, and Ann Arbor was
alive again Saturday night.
It was alive as a policeman
pointed a fingerto a group on
a crowded balcony, smiled and
shouted "Go Blue!"... and as stu-
dents climbed the oak trees lining
the Diag to get a better view of
the celebration ... and as someone
popped out of the sunroof of a red
sedan to clang away on a cow-
bell on South University in the
moments after Jordan Morgan's

Rose, now an analyst with
*** ESPN, will be in the stands, sit-

ting with King and Jackson as
Michigan faces Louisville in the
title game Monday night. How-
ard, a veteran with the Miami
Heat, has a game Tuesday, but
Rose anticipates he will attend.
"The elephant in the room has
been Chris Webber," Rose said
on a Grantland podcast Sunday.
"While he loves us like brothers
and vice versa, there has been a
communication separation that
has basically taken place since we
all were teammates.
"I think the timeout had a lot to
do with it. Here's what I mean: I
think he wants to dissociate him-
self with that moment and that
school."
Twenty years and a day, Chris,
and you live in Atlanta. The Uni-
versity's self-imposed 10-year
dissociation against Webber and
three non-Fab Five players won't
be lifted until May 8, a month
from tonight, but that doesn't
need to keep them away.
Don't misunderstand: this
Michigan team deserves its own
legacy. The Fab Five is long gone,
but I'd love to see a homecoming
in Atlanta, but not for recognition.
It'd be appropriate for the Fab
Five to see a version of Michigan
they knew, Michigan as king of
the hill.
Perhaps, they can even see the
Wolverines finish what the Fab
Five never could. They deserve to
see that much, I think.
And soto Burke for staying, to
Beilein for teaching, to the Fab
Five for starting what they did so
many years ago, and to the rest of
the players and staff for giving us
all a reason to celebrate - thank
you. We won't forget this journey.
Good night, and good luck.

MORGAN
From Page 1B
Mitch McGary. He was on the
Big Ten All-Defense Team and
still wasn't seeing the court.
But the next day, and the day
after that, and two weeks after
that, Morgan preached that he
was doing whatever he could
to help the team, whether that
meant getting playing time or not.
It was hard to completely buy
it. How could he not have been
pissed off, frustrated and angry?
Then Sunday, Morgan stayed in
his role as the defensive specialist
that doesn't fill the stat sheet. He
didn't try to force his game, didn't
try to impress the coaches or fans
or his teammates with anything
other than his own game.
He did what Jordan Morgan
does: he slid over, planted his feet
and got run over.
"That's how you get to Monday
night," said Michigan assistant
coach Bacari Alexander. "For Jor-
dan Morgan to have the adversity
that he experienced and then to
turn around and have the type of
huge defensive stops in a game on
a stage that's so big - it's redemp-
tion for that young man."
When Morgan was taken out of

the starting lineup for good, back
before the firstgame of the Tour-
nament, nobody acted like his
season was done, even though he
played more minutes in the first
game of the Big Ten season than
he did combined in the first four
games of the NCAA Tournament.
"Three weeks ago, we told
Jordan that if we win this whole
thing, you are going to have a
moment that's going to be the
reason we win," Bartelstein said.
"Sure enough, his moment came
tonight. He did somethingthat
will make him remembered for
the rest of his life by Michigan
fans. Everyone was happier for
him than for anyone else."
That's what makes this Michi-
gan team different. It's partially
the talent and it's partiallythe
coaching staff, but it's also a
togetherness and mindset that
allows for a forgotten big man to
make the most important play in
the most important game of the
Wolverines season.
That might not happen with
another program, but it happened
with Michigan, who now sits 40
minutes away from a national
championship.

Albrecht, LeVert fill big
roles in Final Four win

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
ATLANTA - Saturday night,
the almost-redshirt and the late
signee stole the show.
The young guard still wearing
braces, and the overlooked, under-
sized point guard that filled in for
the three starting guards when
they were struggling - Caris
LeVert and Spike Albrecht.
The Michigan men's basket-
ball team knew that Syracuse was
going to give sophomore guard
Trey Burke difficulty penetrating
the zone, and that it was freshman
guard Nik Stauskas' job to knock
down 3-pointers in the corner. But
Burke couldn't hreak the defense
and Stauskas went cold, so the
Wolverines turned to the bench.
After Stauskas missed three
3-pointers, LeVert checked into
the game. The Orange were cry-
ing to gain momentum after going
up by five points, eight minutes
into the first half, but the fresh-
man who hadn't scored all tourna-
ment and hadn't made a 3-pointer
since Feb. 24 buried a long ball
and quelled abit of momentum for
Syracuse.
The Wolverines gained some
momentum of their own, while
LeVert hit another 3-pointer to
start a 9-0 Michigan run that gave
it a seven-point lead late in the first
half.
Albrecht did the same. His first
3-pointer extended the Wolver-
ines' lead to seven points, and his
second shot - the same deep dag-
ger that Michigan had been work-
ing on in practice to prepare for
Syracuse - began the team's run
to end the half.
"It wasn't the first time they've
done that," said assistant coach
Jeff Meyer. "We know they're
there. It's a gift to be able to sit
there, sit there, sit there and then
your team needs you, and you go
in there."
Though LeVert and Albrecht
contributed just eight and six
points, respectively, the duo's
all-around performance is what
impressed the coaches after Sat-
urday night's game.
"It's a proud papa moment,"
said assistant coach LaVall Jordan.
"They work so hard. Those two
guys in particular are the guys
that are in the gym when they
don't have to be in the gym, so it's
good to see it pay off. They come in
and do a film study with our video
coordinator.
"They're hungry, they're thirsty

Freshman guard Spike Albrecht dumped in six points off the bench vs. Syracuse.

to learn, so to have them step up
and make the plays they made
tonight, it was a proud moment. I
was so happy for them."
And Albrect and LeVert knew
that when junior guard Tim Hard-
away Jr. and Burke started to
struggle, their numbers would be
called.
Michigan was dominating
the boards in the first half, and
Syracuse made a couple of key
adjustments on freshmen for-
wards Mitch McGary and Glenn
Robinson III. The Orange began
the second half outmuscling the
forwards on the glass and started
to make a run of their own, but
LeVert responded with defensive
rebounds that helped the Wolver-
ines hold on to their lead late in the
game.
Defensively, LeVert has been
one of Michigan's most solid play-
ers all season. After Michigan
coach John Beilein made it public
that he would not redshirt LeVert,
the freshman would only see play-
ing time when the Wolverines
were in need of a defensive stop.
"He gave us length, the abil-
ity to make plays, you saw that
tonight, he did that in practice
every day," Meyer said. "He gives
us a defender, he might be, if not
the best, he's arguably one of our
best on-ball defenders. So why
wouldn't you play him? ... We felt
like to get to Monday night, we
needed Caris LeVert. He did what
we thought he would do."

That's how the coaches used
LeVert against the taller, longer
Syracuse players.
Meyer said LeVert was a
huge asset in Michigan's defen-
sive matchups - he could guard
Michael Carter-Williams or Bran-
don Triche because LeVert match-
es the size and length of the two
Orange guards.
Though Albrecht has always
been the backup that came in to
give Burke some rest, on Saturday
night, Michigan needed the ball-
handling and poise that Albrecht
showed throughout the tourna-
ment to break Syracuse's press.
"(Spike's) playing with a lot of
moxie, a lot of purpose," Meyer
said. "Frankly, it's what we saw
when we recruited him. When I
watched him in prep school, I saw
a young man that didn't pas the
eye test, but played the game IQ-
wise, he saw plays ahead of plays,
he made plays, and he made shots.
"We really needed a backup
point guard to Trey, and that's
why we recruited him. He's made
good on everything we thought he
would be."
Last year at this point, LeVert
was committed to Ohio Univer-
sity and playing his way to an Ohio
state high school basketball cham-
pionship.
Albrecht was just days away
from signing with Michigan. Now,
they're playing big roles in Michi-
gan's run to a national champion-
ship.

that Mitch McGary would have
more assists in the game than
Trey Burke," said Michigan
assistant coach Bacari Alexan-
der.
Freshman guard Nik Stauskas,
meanwhile, didn't make a single
shot and was held scoreless after
a career outing last weekend in
Dallas.
Syracuse opened the game
with the first real punch, but
Michigan didn't let it hurt. After
the Orange jumped ahead to a
14-9 lead, the Wolverines fin-
ished the half by outscoring Syr-
acuse, 27-11, to take a 36-25 lead
into halftime.
Despite a quiet game from
many of its top scorers, Michigan
dominated the opening stanza
on the heels of its freshmen.
McGary led the first-half charge
with six points, seven rebounds,
four assists and two blocks, but
it was the unexpected contribu-
tions of freshmen guards Spike
Albrecht and Caris LeVert that
sparked the Wolverines. Both
LeVert and Albrecht knocked

down two 3-pointers, filling in
the scoring void left by Hard-
away, Burke and Stauskas, who
combined for eight first-half
points.
The Wolverines got 16 points
from their bench in the opening
period.
"This is the biggest stage in
college basketball and Caris
LeVert and Spike Albrecht did a
great job ofcstepping up we need-
ed it," Burke said. "That just goes
to show how big they are in big
moments."
Added Michigan assistant
LaVall Jordan: "We needed some
guys to step in and step up and
they did that."
Just thirty minutes after the
semifinal victory, when asked if
he's begun to envision what it'll
be like on Monday night should
the Wolverines win, Burke - the
consensus National Player of the
Year - was openly honest.
"You have to have a vision,"
Burke said. "I'm trying to envi-
sion it right now, just jumping up
and down, crying really. Tears
and joy. You have to have a vision
before you play the game. You
have to see it and that's what I'm
going to do."

BREAKDOWN
From Page 1B
Both players struggled in Sat-
urday-night victories. Siva shot
1-of-9 from the field and has hit
just one 3-pointer in the tourna-
ment, while Burke was limited to
seven points on 1-of-8 shooting.
Despite Siva's experience
though, Burke has proven all
year that his play shines the most
when the lights are brightest.
Edge: Michigan
Wings: Guard Russ Smith has
the capability of torching Michi-
gan single-handedly. On the flip
side, the junior has the ability of
shooting his team out of a ball
game, earning him the nick-
name, "Russ-diculous," from his
coach, Rick Pitino.
The high-volume shooter is
averaging 25 points in the tour-
nament but has been shaky from
long range.
Guard-forward Wayne Black-
shear and forward Chane Behan-
an each provide Louisville with
solid length on defensive, but on
offense, their contributions are
often overlooked. The Cardinals'
depth took a major blow when
guard Kevin Ware went down
with a gruesome injury last week
in Indianapolis. Though Ware
has provided Louisville with
plenty of motivation, the Cardi-
nals certainly have to be wary of
getting into foul trouble. Pitino
said on Saturday, his team was
"afraid to foul" and was playing
"very cautious."
On the other sideline, junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. has
done his best "Russ-diculous"
impression. Hardaway's 3-for-13
night against Florida helped the
Gators threaten to put a serious
dent into Michigan's lead, and
his team-high 13 points on Satur-

day were the product of 16 shots,
12 of which clanked out.
FreshmanforwardGlennRob-
inson I should provide some
offense, but he'll again face a
physical mismatch on the defen-
sive end. He'll likely be guarding
Behanan, and though the two
forwards are each 6-foot-6, Rob-
inson is 40 pounds lighter.
The game's x-factor may be
freshman guard Nik Stauskas.
What the freshman gives up on
defense, he can more than make
up on offense with his poten-
tially lethal 3-point shooting.
Stauskas was held scoreless on
Saturday - he said he was suf-
fering through a migraine - but
broke open Michigan's regional
final game open by knocking
down six 3-pointers. If he shoots
anywhere close to that mark, the
Wolverines may run away with
things.
While Michigan's wings
may have the higher upside - if
they're hot, watch out - Louis-
ville's wings possess more con-
sistency, while Smith has been
one of the tournament's top scor-
ers.
Edge: Louisville
Post: Pitino said on Sunday
that his center, Gorgui Dieng,
will likely declare for the NBA at
some point after the title game.
And while Dieng, one of the
nation's top defensive post play-
ers all season, has had his sights
on the draft for a while, fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary's
draft stock was a non-factor just
four weeks ago.
But after being inserted into
the starting lineup at the onset of
the NCAA Tournament, McGary
has registered 16 points and
nearly 12 rebounds per game,
suddenly displaying formidable
lottery-pick talent.
Dieng was held scoreless

after spending most of Saturday
night in foul trouble, but posted
14 points, 11 rebounds and four
blocks against Duke's vaunted
frontcourt in Louisville's region-
al final win.
Dieng has the experience, but
he hasn't faced a player who can
run, pass and shoot like McGary
- the tournament's hottest play-
er - all season.
Edge: Michigan
Bench: Neither team has a
consistent scorer off its bench,
which may mean that which-
ever teams' reserves can come
through may tilt the scales in its
favor.
This was never more preva-
lent than on Saturday. With Siva
and Dieng struggling mightily,
guard-forward Luke Hancock,
who averages seven points per
game, came off the pine to score
20 points thanks in large part
to three 3-pointers. Still, the
absence of Ware shortens the
Cardinals' bench immensely.
While Michigan's starting
scorers were cold, freshman
guards Caris LeVert and Spike
Albrecht each delivered two
critical 3-pointers as the Wol-
verine bench provided 22 points
in the win. Redshirt junior for-
ward Jordan Morgan's stat sheet
has been bare recently, but the
three-year starter has played in
more career games than almost
anyone in the contest.
< With a healthy Ware, Louis-
ville likely had the advantage,
but the Wolverines have more
options at the moment.
Edge: Michigan
Coaching: Pitino found out
earlier this week that, accord-
ing to reports, he's headed to the
Naismith Memorial Basketball
Hall of Fame. He's appearing in
his seventh career Final Four -

with his third different team,
nonetheless - and has a previ-
ous National Championship on
his resum. The Louisville coach
has eight-years of NBA head-
coaching experience, and this
season is his 27th as a collegiate
headman.
Still, Pitino said Michigan's
offense under coach John Beilein
is as difficult as any he's ever had
to prepare for in a one-day turn-
around scenario.
Beilein was brought to Ann
Arbor to take his X's-and-O's
wizardry and combine it with
elite talent. Thus far, it's worked,
as he's captured a Big Ten Cham-
pionship and in this year's post-
season, blown through defenses
like VCU and Florida that were
supposed to stifle Michigan.
Louisville will likely attempt
to pressure the Wolverines, but
Beilein should have an effec-
tive plan in place to counter it.
Besides, Michigan has excelled
in up-tempo games all year long.
Pitino has the wealth of big-
game experience, but Beilein is
as good, or better, than anyone at
in-game coaching.
Edge: Push
Louisville is one of the few
teams that can match-up with
Michigan talent-wise, but
National Championship games
rarely come down -to talent
alone. Each team is littered with
future-NBA players, but in the
biggest stages, it's often the best
player that leads his team to vic-
tory.
After a sluggish outing on Sat-
urday, Burke - the best player on
either team - is due for one final
signature performance before he
takes off his maize-and-blue jer-
sey for one final time.
Final score: Michigan 77, Lou-
isville 69
