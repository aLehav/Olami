Low-income
individuals find
work with monthly
paper Groundcover
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
While people normally read
newspapers to find out what's
happening in the world, a group
of homeless individuals hope to
use the print media to provide
economic relief, empowerment

and a sense of community.
The monthly street newspaper
Groundcover, founded in April
2010, provides job opportunities
and serves as a collective voice
for people facing tough financial
conditions. Seventy-five people
in total have been trained at
seminars provided by the news-
paper, which contains articles
on numerous topics as well as
advertisements from local busi-
nesses. The paper is now also
garnering greater support from
University students.
Vendors receive 10 free papers
to sell and can subsequently buy

additional papers for people to
purchase for 25 cents each. The
paper sells for $1 per copy.
Groundcover publisher Susan
Beckett said the newspaper plays
an important role for homeless
people by offering thei a source
of income.
"The way the economy is right
now, there are so many people
who have no alternative," Beck-
ett said. "(For one vendor) that
dollar is what lets him do his
laundry."
Currently, the newspaper has
25 active vendors. The seminars
the 75 people have attended

include classes on advanced sell-
ing, basic computing and writ-
ing for potential contributors to
Groundcover.
Beckett described Ground-
cover's content as "eclectic,"
which ranges from interviews
with members of the Ann Arbor
community to articles on how to
reduce one's carbon footprint.
"We want people to buy the
paper, we want people to enjoy
the paper and 12 pages of pov-
erty and homelessness can get
pretty depressing," Beckett said.

OBSERVING ON CAMPUS
Preachers legally able to
voice opinions on campus


Speakers protected

on 'U' property
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
The Diag is often filled with
sounds of students hustling to
class, squirrels running about,
crunching leaves and some-
times, the voices of people shar-
ing their beliefs.

one of these people is Mike
Reed, also known as Brother
Mike, who often visits the Diag
for his "open air preaching."
And while some students say
demonstrators on campus irri-
tate them, the preachers are not
in violation of any University
policies and are protected by the
First Amendment.
The people who air their.
views on the Diag come to cam-
pus since it provides them the
opportunity to speak to stu-
dents. Reed said he and others

speak on University property
because they are worried about
students' futures.
"I believe most of them are
living in sin," Reed said. "A lot
of the students are the lead-
ers of future generations so we
believe it's a good time to bring
God's truth into play, to bring
the Bible, and hopefully change
some minds of some of the stu-
dents."

Michigamua accused of sexism

35 years ago this week (Sep-
tember 28,1976):
Michigamua, the campus
leader organization now called
Order of Angell, was faced with
an alleged violation of Title IX
- a law that prohibits sexual
discrimination in institutions
funded by the federal govern-
ment.
At the time, the organization's
members were all male. Amy
Blumenthal, then-vice president
of the Michigan Student Assem-
bly and Anita Tanay, a previous
MSA member at the time, filed
the complaint. They said the
University favored members of
Michigamua over other groups
for the use of campus facilities.

In the complaint, Blumen-
thal wrote that she believed the
University gave Michigamua
members higher quality football
tickets and better job opportuni-
ties compared to other students.
60 years ago this week (Sep-
tember 28,1951):
The University of Michigan
community was introduced to
a new song called "Cow College
Chant," which was dedicated to
Michigan State College - now
Michigan State University.
The song premiered before
students at a rally for that week-
end's football game. Harry
Kipke, former head coach of the
Michigan football team from
1929-1937, also made an-appear-

ance at the rally.
70 years ago this week
(October 2,1941):
Five hundred eighty-one
international students enrolled
for the University's fall semester
in 1941.
The students represented
more than 69 nations, including
the first student from Iceland
ever to attend the University.
Because of World War II, of
the 144 students coming from
Europe, 138 applied for citizen-
ship in the United States. Great
Britain had the largest number
of exchange students with 164
enrolled and 123 seeking citi-
zenship.

Blagoj evich sentencing
trial delayed indefinitely

Cuba looks to improve
relations with the U.S.

Original date
in conflict with
similar trial
CHICAGO (AP) - A federal
judge yesterday indefinitely
delayed next week's scheduled
sentencing for Rod Blagojev-
ich on multiple corruption con-
victions, apparently because it
would have conflicted with the
start of a related trial of a long-
time Illinois powerbroker who
raised money for the former gov-
ernor.
In a three-sentence notice
posted electronically, U.S. Dis-
trict Judge James Zagel in Chi-
cago did not offer any reason for
cancelling Blagojevich's Oct. 6
sentencing, saying simply that it
has been "stricken until further
order by the court."
Defense attorney Sheldon
Sorosky cited the Oct. 3 start of
the corruption trial of William
Cellini, which Zagel is also pre-
siding over.
"Bytradition, a judge will
always continue a sentencing if
it invades the province of a jury
trial.... That's what this was,"
Sorosky told The Associated
Press later Monday. Blagojevich
had no objection to the delay,
Sorosky added. .
While Zagel did not set a new
date, Sorosky said Blagojevich
would now likely be sentenced
in late October or early Novem-
ber - soon after Cellini's trial
finishes.
Cellini's trial is the last major
case stemming from federal
investigations of Blagojevich's
governorship. The Springfield
Republican, 76, was known as
"The Pope" of Illinois politics for
his influence in the halls of state
power dating back to the 1960s.
Cellini has pleaded not guilty
to trying to squeeze a Hollywood
producer for campaign cash for
Blagojevich, though prosecutors
do not claim in their indictment
that the then-governor played
a role in the alleged shakedown

Foreign Minister
also asks for release
of five imprisoned
Cubans
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Cuba wants to re-establish rela-
tions with the United States with
a focus on humanitarian and
other issues, Foreign Minister
Bruno Rodriguez said yesterday.
Rodriguez also called on Presi-
dent Barack Obama to release five
Cubans serving U.S. espionage
sentences, telling the opening of
the new U.N. General Assembly
that the continued imprison-
ment of the five men convicted of
espionage in 2001 is "inhumane."
The Cuban government refers to

the five men as heroes who were
gathering information about ter-
rorist groups in the United States
to protect their homeland.
The foreign minister said the
two countries had many points of
understanding in common.
"The Cuban government reit-
erates its willingness and interest
to move toward the normaliza-
tion of relations with the United
States," Rodriguez said.
"Today I reiterate the proposal
of beginning a dialogue aimed
at solving bilateral problems,
including humanitarian issues,
as well as the offer of negotiating
several cooperation agreements
to combat drug-trafficking, ter-
rorism, human smuggling, pre-
vent natural disasters and protect
the environment."
Among the humanitarian

issues pending between the two
countries is the continued impris-
onment of American Alan Gross,
who the Cuban government
accuses ofillegally bringing com-
munications equipment onto the
island while on a USAID-funded
democracy building program.
In March of this year he was
sentencedto 15 years in prison for
crimes against the state.
Cuban officials including Pres-
ident Raul Castro accused him of
spying,butGross sayshewasonly
trying to help the island's tiny
Jewish community get Internet
access.
The case has harmed .any
chance of improved relations
between Washington , and
Havana, which briefly seemed
to be getting better after Obama
assumed the presidency.

attempt. Sorosky said Blagojev-
ich was not expected tobe called
as a witness.
Jurors at Blagojcich's retri-
al earlier this yeas found the
54-year-old guilty on 17 of 20
corruption charges, including
attempted extortion for trying
to sell or trade President Barack
Obama's vacated U.S. Senate
seat. At his first trial last year, a
jury deadlocked on all but one
count - convicting Blagojevich
of lying to the FBI.
Blagojevich faces a maximum
sentence of 305 years in prison -
though federal guidelines dictate
he get far less. Most legal experts
say Zagel is likely to sentence
Blagojevich to around ten years.
In the same notice Monday,
Zagel also denied all motions

filed by Blagojevich after his
retrial ended in June, includ-
ing requests for his convictions
to be overturned and for a third
trial. The judge said only that
"post-trial motions are denied."
A full, written explanation will
be issued later, he said.
Blagojevich's attorneys had
accused prosecutors and Zagel
of extreme bias against their cli-
ent, arguing in one 158-page fil-
ing that "the playing field was so
unlevel that Blagojevich never
stood a chance at a fair trial."
Sorosky said he was "dis-
appointed" in Zagel's deni-
al of the post-trial motions.
The defense plans to appeal
Blagojevich's convictions, but
Sorosky said that could only be
done after a sentence is imposed.

Helicopter crash
in northern Mich.
kills two men
A Macomb County man and his
friend were killed when a small,
private helicopter crashed as they
flew to a hunting cabin in Michi-
gan's northern Lower Peninsula.
The helicopter's wreckage
was found yesterday morning
by a hunter on his property in a

Michigan State Police Detective
Gary Nesbitt said.
About the time the wreckage
was found yesterday, the pilot's
family had filed a missing per-

Detroit, Nesbitt said.
The crash site is in a wooded

cabin is in the Alpena area, about
15 miles northeast of Caledonia

Strauss-Kahn asks
N.Y. court to reject
maid's lawsuit
Dominique Strauss-Kahn
0 claimed yesterday he has diplo-
matic immunity and asked a New
York court to dismiss a lawsuit
filed by the hotel maid who says
he sexually assaulted her.
Attorneys for the former Inter-
national Monetary Fund leader
filed the motion in a Bronx court,
arguing judges there do not have
the ability to try the case, because
Strauss-Kahn's time as head of
the fund gives him immunity
from the litigation.
The 62-year-old Strauss-
Kahn was initially charged with
attempted rape and held under
pricey house arrest after the
maid, Nafissatou Diallo, said he
attacked her in his hotel suite
May 14 and forced her to perform -
oral sex. The case was eventu-
ally dismissed when prosecutors
said they had lost faith in Diallo's
credibility after a series of lies she
told them unrelated to the assault
allegations.

Under deal, U.S.
to finish nuclear
research facility for
medical isotopes
NEW YORK (AP) - The Unit-
ed States and Ukraine signed a
deal yesterday to remove the for-
mer Soviet country's stockpile of
weapons-grade uranium by early
next year.
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Ukrainian
Foreign Minister Kostyantyn
Gryshchenko represented their
nations in signing the agreement
to remove the stockpile, which
could provide enough material
to build several nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced last
year at an international nuclear
security conference hosted by
President Barack Obama but was
not formalized until yesterday.
Clinton and Gryshchenko had
hoped to sign the deal in July,
but it was delayed amid Ukrai-
nian reservations, according to
U.S. officials. Among other rea-
sons, Ukraine wanted assuranc-
es that the United States would
complete a $25 million nuclear
research facility called for under
the deal.
The research facility will be
able to produce 50 different types
of medical isotopes, using only
low-enriched uranium and Clin-
ton said the U.S. was fully com-
mitted to meeting the timelines
for constructing the facility so it
would be up dnd running by 2014.
The Ukrainian government
also wanted to ensure that the.
uranium deal was properly
approved under government
regulations. The government
may be particularly sensitive,

because former Prime Minister
Yulia Tymoshenko was arrested
and charged with not obtaining
proper approval when signing a
natural gas import contract with
Russia in 2009.
Clinton praised Ukraine for
making the "bold commitment"
to world security.
"This deal is a win-win for
both countries and both peo-
ples," she said. "It provides tan-
gible benefits for the people of
Ukraine and it makes the world
safer for all people."
. The agreement calls for
Ukraine to remove all of its
bomb-grade uranium to Rus-
sia by April 2012. The mate-
rial would be blended down and
made useless for bombmaking.
Late last year, the United States
helped Ukraine make the first
shipment of 110 pounds.
Clinton also took the oppor-
tunity to gently chide the Ukrai-
nians for recent backsliding on
democratic principles, saying
that the 20th anniversary of
Ukraine's independence in 2011
is art opportunity to reflect on
U.S.-Ukrainian relations. She
noted that it isn't easy to build a
democracy from the collapse of a
Soviet republic, but said the U.S.
wanted to see improvements.
"We are very committed to
democratic progress continu-
ing in Ukraine and therefore it is
vital that the government avoid
any actions that could undermine
democracy or the rule of law or
political participation," she said.
She did not elaborate but her
comment was a clear reference to
the case of Tymoshenko.
The United States has criti-
cized the arrest as politically
motivated and said it raises ques-
tions about Ukraine's commit-
ment to the rule of law.

Mousalem diverts
blame of about
2,600 deaths from
President Assad
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The Syrian foreign minister,
ignoring the mounting death
toll from the bloody govern-
ment crackdown on dissent,
told the United Nations yester-
day that external critics were
to blame for the violence and
for causing delays in President
Bashar Assad's plans for demo-
cratic reforms.
In a speech to the U.N. Gen-
eral Assembly, Foreign Minister
Walid Moualem sought to paint
the Assad regime as having
been on the brink of wide-rang-_
ing democratic reforms when
foreign inspired religious radi-
cals and armed groups forced
the Assad regime to put down
the rebellion to hold the country
together.
Moualem said reforms "had
to take a back seat to other
priorities. Our overriding pri-
ority was facing the external

pressures which were at times
tantamount to blatant conspira-
cies."
The Syrian government is
under stiff sanctions by world
governments, including the
United States which has said
Assad should step aside.
The Syrian uprising began
in mid-March, inspired by the
Arab revolutions that have
driven out autocratic rulers in
Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Presi-
dent Bashar Assad unleashed a
deadly crackdown that the U.N.
estimates has killed some 2,600
people.
Assad insists the unrest is
being driven by terrorists act-
ing out a foreign conspiracy to
fracture Syria. The regime dis-
putes the accounts of civilian
deaths and says 1,400 people
have been killed, evenly split
between security forces and
the opposition.
The longtime foreign minis-
ter said that internal desires for
reform "have been manipulat-
ed to futher objectives which
are alien to the interests and
express desires of the Syrian
people.
Human Rights Watch was

quick to dispute Moualem.
"The facts on the ground, as
documented by the UN or our-
selves, speak louder: the Syrian
government has engaged in a
merciless campaign of killings,
torture, and arbitrary deten-
tions to silence its people. The
Security Council needsto take
notice and act," the human
rights monitor said in a state-
ment.
In a speech to the U.N. on
Wednesday, U.S. President
Barack Obama called on the
Security Council to sanction
Syria.
The Security Council's
response to months of violence
in Syria was a statement con-
demning Assad for turning his
forces against his people.

New Libyan leadership to
end state security courts

NATO continues
air strikes against
Gadhafi forces
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - Lib-
ya's transitional justice minis-
ter said yestserday that he has
approved a measure to abol-
ish the country's state security
prosecution and courts, which
sentenced opponents of the old
regime to prison.
At a press conference in Trip-
oli, Mohammed al-Alagi, part
of Libya's new leadership after
the ouster of Moammar Gad-
hafi, said he has signed a docu-
ment to disband the bodies. The
step still needs approval by the
National Transitional Council
that now runs the country.
"I am personally very happy
to sign an approval to end the
state security prosecution and
court, and the state security
appeals court," al-Alagi said.
He said the document
includes a request to abolish
a third court for special cases
where many opposition mem-
bers were sentenced to life
terms in prisons like Abu Salim
in Tripoli, where inmates were
massacred by Gadhafi's regime.
Libyans are. pressing for
ward with efforts to do away
with some of the most hated
remnants of the former regime
even though fighting continues
and the ousted leader's where-
abouts remains unknown.
Hundreds of civilians fled
Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte
yesterday to escape growing
shortages of food and medicine
and escalating fears that their
homes will be struck during
fighting between revolutionary

forces and regime loyalists.
Anti-Gadhafi fighters
launched their offensive
against Sirte nearly two weeks
ago, but have faced fierce resis-
tance from loyalists holed up
inside the city. After a bloody
push into Sirte again over the
weekend, revolutionary fight-
ers say they have pulled back
to plan their assault and allow
civilians more time to flee.
NATO, which has played a
key role in decimating Gadhafi's
military during the Libyan civil
war, has kept up its air cam-
paign since the fall of Tripoli
last month. The alliance said
yesterday its warplanes struck
eight military targets near
Sirte a day earlier, including an
ammunition and vehicle stor-
age facility and rocket launcher.
Sirte, 250 miles (400 kilo-
meters) southeast of Tripoli
on the Mediterranean coast, is
one of the last remaining bas-
tions of Gadhafi loyalists since
revolutionary fighters stormed
into the capital last month. The
fugitive leader's supporters also
remain in control of the town of
Bani Walid, southeast of Trip-
oli, and pockets of territory in
the country's south.
Civilians fleeing Sirte Mon-
day described grave shortages
of food, fuel, drinking water
and medicine.
Eman Mohammed, a
30-year-old doctor at the city's
central Ibn Sina Hospital, said
the facility was short on most
medicines and had no oxygen
in the operating rooms.She said
most days, patients who reach
the hospital find no one to treat
them because fuel shortages
and fear keep staff from coming
to work.

The right to choose
Partial-birth abortion is a personal decision
Partial-birth abortion has been a morally controversial topic.
With the passage of a new bill in the Michigan state legisla-
ture, partial-birth abortions are now illegal by state law, on
top of the federal ban already in place by the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act of 2003 passed by the U.S. Congress. If the state legislation
is enacted, performing a partial-birth abortion would be a two-year
felony. While partial-birth abortion is a difficult subject, the reality
is that women should have the right to decide what to do with their
bodies. The state ban is redundant given the federal ban already in
place. But more importantly, the government shouldn't interfere in
private, individual decisions.

Partial-birth abortion is a complicated
procedure that involves the death of a fetus
after the second trimester. The procedure
was performed in less than 2 percent of abor-
tions, according to 1999 data from the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention. While
partial birth abortions are a complicated
issue from a moral standpoint, the larger
issue is the government's restriction of indi-
vidual rights.
The recent bill, which will head to Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder's desk after the confer-
ence committee has reviewed it, models the
federal law and makes the procedure punish-
able under state law. Since the law was upheld
in the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision Gon-
zales v. Carhart, there's no reason to believe it
will be repealed any time soon.
Taking time to pass state legislation that
reaffirms a federal law is an insult to Michi-
gan citizens. Instead of focusing on bills to
create jobs and help rebuild the state's econ-
omy, the Legislature is focusing on prohib-
iting an already banned procedure. If there
was evidence that partial-birth abortions
were performed in large numbers through-
out the state this legislation would be some-

what explicable, but partial-birth abortion
procedures are rare. The state government
is unnecessarily pushing a social issue, and
it needs to focus its attention on Michigan's
more pressing concerns.
The legality of abortion indicates the con-
stitutional support for a woman's right to
choose. Partial-birth abortions is a conten-
tious topic, but it's not up to the government
to permit or prohibit the procedure. Women
should speak with doctors and other health
professionals to make an appropriate, per-
sonal decision. By speaking with a doctor,
they can educate themselves on the health
implications of the procedure and make a
responsible personal choice.
The argument isn't about the moral impli-
cations of abortion. Rather, it's about govern-
ment intervention in personal decisions. A
woman should have the right to make her own
decisions about her body and an unborn child
she may bare. In today's economic climate,
Michigan doesn't have the luxury to spend
time and resources on partisan, social poli-
cies. Snyder should reaffirm his commitment
to tackling the state's pressing issues and veto
this bill. .

more a chance for candidates of all
political stripes to pander to their
bases than engage one another in
thoughtful debate. Republicans
as well as Democrats are guilty of
evading questions, botching facts
and concerning themselves more
with landing a zinger than formulat-
ing a coherent argument. Butgiven a
24-hour media machine that thrives
on simplistic sound bites, can you
blame candidates for their unapolo-
getic grandstanding? For their par-
ticipation in the circus that is the
televised, commercialized political
debate?
Yes, you can. But more on that
later.
For starters, let's brush up on his-
tory. The first televised presiden-
tial debate occurred in 1960 when a
young, tan, poised John F. Kennedy
outperformed a sickly, clammy, life-
less Richard Nixon in the first of a
four-part debate series. For those
70 million American viewers who
tuned in to watch the debate unfold
on television, Nixon, infamously
sweating under the glaring studio
lights, was visibly uncomfortable.
According to the Museum of Broad-
cast Communications, the TV audi-
ence largely considered Kennedy the
winner. The much smaller audience
listening in on the radio, however,
thought Nixon triumphant. Though
the debate's impact on the election
results is disputed (Kennedy went
on to win the presidency), it set a
precedent for the future of televised
political debate.
Appearance matters. That's an
enduring lesson of the Kennedy-
Nixon debates. Advances in tech-
nology increasingly necessitate
that our leaders be better publicists

than public servants, better actors
than thinkers. Public scrutiny has
grown to the point where we care
more about candidates' body lan-
guage than their words. Now don't
get me wrong - I want a confident
commander in chief capable of pro-
jecting strength and composure. We
need an articulate voice in the White
House, but problems arise when
we're made to believe that the most
attractive candidate is best suited
for the job.
Which brings me to the contempo-
rary media. Superficial debates of the
modern kind don't exist ina vacuum.
They don't spontaneously occur. Far
from it. They're carefully crafted
productions where entertainment,
ratings and artificial narratives take
precedence over journalistic integ-
rity. Looking at the gaudy sets of
recent Republican debates, you'd
think you were watching American
Idol - except that even reality TV
isn't this flashy. (In June, Jon Stewart
aptly deemed the set of a CNN-spon-
sored debate "America's most patri-
otic game show.") Pageantry detracts
from true deliberation. Everything
but the bare minimum - modera-
tor, candidates, pens and paper - is
a distraction. This isn't debate. It's
theater.
Then there's the audience.
Spectators at this month's Repub-
lican debates seem to be making
more headlines than the candidates
themselves. During the Sept. 7
MSNBC/Politico debate, modera-
tor Brian Williams directed a ques-
tion toward Texas Gov. Rick Perry:
"Your state," he began, "has exe-
cuted 234 death rqw inmates, more
than any other governor in modern
times. Have you..." Before Williams
could finish, the crowd erupted in
prolonged applause. Perry, invigo-
rated by his audience's apparent
fervor for capital punishment, went
on to assert (in stony coldness) that
he has "never struggled" with that
fact. That's particularly chilling
when you consider that one of those
executed was Cameron Willingham,
who was put to death under Perry's
watch even though, recent evidence
affirmed his innocence. (Google it) I
wonder if Perry's cheerleaders in the
crowd knew that.

SARAH SMITH AND RICK STEPANOVIC I
Welcome to Greek Life

The post-racial facade

0

To the nearly 1,400 men and women who
joined the University's Greek community this
past weekend - first and foremost, we'd like
to offer you our wholehearted congratula-
tions. The decision to go Greek isn't an easy
one, but we believe it might be the best one
you'll make during your undergraduate years.
As Panhel's vice president of public relations
and Interfraternity Council's vice president
of recruitment, we've had the most incredible
journey in Greek Life and in our individual
chapters, and we're so excited to share that
journey with you.
We want to encourage you to really make
the most of being Greek. Much of your expe-
rience with Greek Life thus far - outside
of the recruitment process - has probably
been social. It's certainly one of the most vis-
ible elements of Greek Life, with hundreds
of tailgaters dancing outside a fraternity on
a Football Saturday or thousands of guests
"attending" an open party on Facebook. More
than likely, you've spent the weekend getting
to know your new brothers or sisters at social
events like these - and that's definitely not a
bad thing. But while fraternities and sorori-
ties are social by nature, there's a lot more
to Greek Life than the social scene, and we
think those aspects are what make the Greek
experience truly excellent.
In the-year ahead, you'll be presented with
opportunities to serve your chapter, and we
strongly encourage you to take them. Wheth-
er it's something small like attending a semi-
nar, volunteering to help plan an upcoming
philanthropy eventor a big commitment like
representing your chapter in Junior Panhel
or JIFC, giving back to your chapter makes
you more invested in its success. Between the
two of us, we've served fraternity and soror-
ity life in practically every capacity - ranging
from holding board positions in our chap-
ters, attending seminars put on by the Office
of Greek Life as freshmen to planning them
with our councils as seniors. We've attended
a combined total of 16 leadership conferences,
as near as the Michigan League and as far
away as Athens, Greece. We've even turned
our passion for Greek Life into professional
opportunities - Sarah will be interning with
her sorority this summer, while Rick just got
a full-time offer to be a traveling consultant
for his fraternity. So are we a little extreme

when it comes to Greek leadership? Maybe.
But when we joined our chapters three years
ago, we were clueless - we were just open to
getting involved.
A focus on things like scholarship, ath-
letics and philanthropy can enhance not
only your experience in Greek Life, but your
growth as a person as well. In addition to all
the resources that are already available to you
as a student, being Greek gives increased aca-
demic support - including access to new net-
works of study buddies in your class, advice
from older brothers and sisters in your major
and recognition through scholarship pro-
grams. Participation in intramural sports,
which has leagues exclusively for fraternities
and sororities, will teach you how to work
with your brothers and sisters as a team and
will be helpful both on and off the playing
field. And when Greeks come together to help
others, we can accomplish some astounding
things - our combined fundraising efforts
rival that of any campus service group, and
our hands-on work in the community helps
our neighbors directly and makes us better
men and women.
But while we think it's important to give
back to Greek Life, we also suggest that you
take advantage of all its benefits - the most
obvious one being brotherhood and sister-
hood. In the next few years, you'll become
closer to your pledge class than you could pos-
sibly imagine now, and they'll stay with you
for the rest of your life. They'll be there for
you in the good times - like when Rick took a
road trip to St. Louis with his brothers - and
in the bad times, like when Sarah's mom was
diagnosed with cancer last semester. These
bonds are the true benefit of going Greek, and
we urge you to develop them in every way
possible during your time in college.
With that in mind, we'd like to offer you
our congratulations once again and our best
wishes for the new member term ahead of
you. We sincerely hope that you'll get as much
out of your Greek experiences as we've gotten
out of ours.

Council's vice president of recruitment.

To get into the University, we
all had to write an admis-
sions essay explaining the
importance of
diversity in our
lives. If you think
back to that
essay you wrote
in high school,
what's your opin-
ion of it? Because -
I'm willing to bet JEREMY
that most of you LEVY
would now con-
sider your essay
crap, hyperbole, cliche or all of the
above. And if you're like me, it's not
because you are opposed to diversi-
ty. It's because diversity has become
an empty buzzword that's too-often
trumpeted. As a friend of mine put it,
"If the University values diversity so
much, why is everyone here white?"
Indeed, in the U.S.- News and
World Report Diversity index, the
University scored a .43/1, with the
highest-ranking school (Rutgers)
scoring a.76. The "Diversity Matters
at Michigan" page may boast about
accepting students from 49 states,
but information about the racial
makeup of the University is limited.
Think of the diversity question as
a backdrop to the question discussed
on The New York Times Room for
Debate Blog last Wednesday, "Under
Obama, is America 'Post-Racial?"'
The academics on the blog seemed
to agree that if "post-racial" is sup-
posed to mean "racially equal," the
answer is a clear no. Among other
indicators, black and Latino unem-
ployment rates are 16 and 11 per-
cent respectively - well above the
national average of 9.1 percent.
But if the question is how the
country's public actors, most nota-
bly President Barack Obama, treat
race issues, the term "post-racial"
begins to make more sense. Obama
and the University are similar in
that they face huge political risks by
promoting race-conscious policies.

Rather, they advocate policies that
are intended to help everyone in the
hopes that disadvantaged minorities
will also benefit. Economic stimulus
is supposed to boost the economy
for everyone, just as all students are
supposed to benefit from a diverse
campus.
Unfortunately, as shown above,
these policies don't benefit every-
one equally. All indicators blatantly
show that minorities are still at a
severe disadvantage.
Yet, signs of a "post-racial" mind-
set pervade in many other ways.
If you look at the primary issues
covered by the political parties and
media cycles, it's difficult to tell that
there are even racial issues in the
country. Take discrimination for
example. This summer, I worked at
the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in Washington D.C., a
government agency with the mis-
sion of ending employment discrimi-
nation in the United States. When
I told people about the job, many
expressed the belief that employ-
ment discrimination is no longer a
major problem.
One might reach the same con-
clusion from seeing how the rest of
Washington perceives the EEOC.
My first red flag was that the EEOC
offices are located in a building that
was a warehouse no more than 15
years ago, far removed from the
center of the city's activity. More
importantly, as any EEOC staffer
will tell you, Congress gives the
agency very little enforcement
power. EEOC is allowed to offer rec-
ommendations on the employment
practices of private companies and
other government agencies but has
no mechanism to make them oblige.
Generally speaking, the prevail-
ing view around the District was
that anti-discrimination initiatives
interfered with the presumably
more important work of the rest of
the agencies.
While such signs might lead one

to believe that discrimination hardly
occurs anymore, racial minorities
are likely to say that, on the contrary,
the problem is still very prevalent.
And research shows that there is
a large opinion gap between racial
groups on the issue.
Diversity has
become an empty
buzzword.j
In one recent study done through
the Association for Psychologi-
cal Science entitled "Whites See
Racism as a Zero-Sum Game That
They Are Now Losing," professors *
Michael I. Norton and Samuel R.
Sommers asked a nationwide sam-
ple to rate the seriousness of black
discrimination on a one to 10 scale
for each decade between 1950 and
the present. While most respon-
dents agreed on a rating of nine or
10 for the 1950s, white respondents
gave an average rating of 3.5 for
the present. Black respondents, on
the other hand, gave the present an
average rating of 6.
When it comes down to it, the
term "post-racial" can really only
apply to mindset and presentation.
Even though many issues dispro-
portionally affect minorities, public
figures almost always handle these
issues in race-neutral terms. And
issues that only affect minorities
tend to be forgotten altogether. To
an average white citizen minimally
invested in the news and political
discourse, it may very well appear
that racial problems in America have
been solved for decades.

"The whole business model
was based on how much we love
South U," said Narayan, who
added that he lived in the sur-

was the perfect location for an
emerging business.
Custom-made shirts are
still the greatest percentage of
Underground Printing's mer-
chandise, but the business is
constantly evolving by focusing
on students as vital costumers
and trendsetters, Narayan said.
"Students tell us what's popu-

information and translate it
into collegiate apparel," he
said. "What students want
becomes what everybody else
wants."
Narayan said his experi-
ences at the University as an
undergraduate student were
essential to his success as a
business owner. His work in
organizations including Dance
Marathon at the University of
. Michigan, Michigan Student
Assembly and Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity helped him under-
stand the needs of student
customers, like the desire for
in-person costumer service.
"It's convenience, quality,

Along with Underground

launched a new website and
extended the store's business

Though the company is

he also understands the impor-

company makes for student

received, but Beckett eventually
contacted the North American
Street Newspaper Association
and received a $1,000 start-up
donation by 1Matters, which also
provided funding to launch street
newspapers in Toledo, Ohio and
Detroit.
Beckett said the majority of
people who buy Groundcover are
Ann Arbor residents, rather than
University students or faculty.
"Sales in the University area
generally have been way, way
lower than anywhere else,"
Beckett said. "I think part of it is
because of the lack of publicity to
that particular community."
However, in an effort to rem-
edy this, Education junior Mar-
quise Williams plans to start a
Groundcover Club by the end of
the semester to increase awar-
ness of the newspaper among
the University community. He
hopes to recruit students to help
the Groundcover staff, organize
workshops for the vendors and
Tenyears after Narayan
opened the first Underground
Printing store with business
partner Ryan Gregg, he still
loves what he does.
"I like dealing with people,"
Narayan said. "I have a lot of cus-
tomers I handle myself."
While future plans for the
company include constructing
new stores, Narayan said he is
carefully calculating the busi-
ness's next move.
"Our plans are to grow, but
grow in a manner that is best for
the company and our custom-
ers ..." he said. "We've had years
when we've tried to add a lot of
stores. We're now at the point to
where we've matured as a com-

increase awareness about poverty
and homelessness.
"Hopefully, in time, people
will begin to be more receptive
to the paper and begin buying the
paper,"Williams said.
Groundcover currently has
more than 15 regular advertise-
ments from local businesses,
many of which have provided
resources to help the newspaper
and its vendors. Beckett said
Elmo's Main Street T-Shirts
has donated waist aprons and
T-shirts for the vendors to wear
while they distribute their publi-
cation.
"Every new vendor goes to
Elmo, and he lets them pick out
the color that they want and he
gives them two free T-shirts on
the spot," Beckett said. "He's just
so generous."
John Roos, owner of Roos
Roast Coffee - which is located
on Rosewood Street and is sold in
a number of Ann Arbor cafes and
restaurants - said he is proud
his business is the newspaper's
first advertiser because he sup-
ports the opportunities the paper
brings to those without a job or
home.
"Some people were like, 'Why
should you advertise there? It's
not your demographic,"' Roos
said. "That didn't even come into
my mind."

spots. We don't want to compro-
mise for growth."
Narayan offered advice for
aspiring entrepreneurs and
stressed the importance of hav-
ing strong problem-solving skills
and being open to new opportu-
nities.
"I like to tell people ... (to)
learn everything. Be proficient in
everything," he said. "Don't feel
like you have to choose your path
right from the get-go."
Narayan added that he likes to
tell students that they can choose
whatever path is right for them.
"Your degree from the Uni-
versity is a ticket. It opens up
doors," he said.

Barald said she feels members

the Diag is something the Uni-
versity doesn't usually interfere
with because it falls under the
U.S. Constitutional right to free-
dom of speech, according to Joe
Piersante, deputy chief of the
University's Department of Pub-
lic Safety.
Piersante added that expres-
sions of opinion have always been
welcome at the University since
he started working on campus in
1991. Rarely, he said, have protest-
ers on the Diagcaused problems.
"The University has a commit-
ment to freedom of speech and
artistic expression, even diverse
opinions that people might not
agree with," Piersante said. "The
University encourages open dia-
logue and debate over diverse
issues"
However, DPS would stop
activities on the Diag or other
areas of campus if someone were
threatened or assaulted or if
people prevented normal busi-
ness from occurring. DPS spokes-
woman Diane Brown said the
department would also remove
protestors if they interfered with

"It's really hardto say because
this is our first year doing this

it could be similar, but it could

control setting is reserved for the
group owners.
"I would encourage students
to see what groups they're mem-
bers of, see if they still want to
be members of those groups, see
if those groups are public or pri-
vate," Bernard said. "If the owner
is unwilling to change the status
of the group, you should be asking
yourself whether or not you still
want to be a member.... If not, just
ask to be removed."
FACULTY SUPPORT NEW
COPYRIGHT POLICY
During the SACUA meet-
ing yesterday, faculty members
expressed their approval of the
new University copyright policy.
Bernard, who wrote the new
policy, said it is much shorter and
a scheduled activity in a reserved
space.
"If (the people interfering with
the space) don't voluntarily com-
ply and allow the event - either
the speaker to go on or the display
to be put up or whatever - then
police can be called to remove
those people," Brown said. "It's
more problematic for us to have
to remove people out on the Diag,
but we have had to do that in the
past."
When a complaint about pro-
testors is filed with DPS, an offi-
cer is sent to assess the situation.
But if there isn't cause for DPS to
intervene, then the department
works to educate the person who
filed the complaint about First
Amendment rights.
Though some students said
they encounter protestors and
preachers frequently, Piersante
said that during the duration of
his time at the University, the
number of demonstrators has
decreased.
"The Diag is generally a very
safe area where we take few
criminal complaints," Piersante
said. "Students going through
that area where somebody is
expressing their opinion have

said.

clearer than it was previously. He
added that the policy outlines the
rights students have to the papers
they write.
"It clearly states that students
hold the rights to the works that
they author when they author
them as individuals," Bernard
said. "When they author them as
employees at the University, then
the University is going to hold the
rights."
Bernard said rights for Uni-
versity faculty and students have
expanded with the new policy.
"I think it's a good change,"
he said. "We've had an over-
whelmingly positive reception to
it. Students in particular should
be really happy with it because
it really bluntly puts faculty and
departments on notice that stu-
dents have rights and we should
be mindful of those rights."

Incidents involving demon-
strators and students are rare,
Piersante said. Except for one
incident, Reed said he has never
felt hostility from students.
"A couple years ago one guy
threatened me, basically to beat
me up," Reed said.
While people have the right
to voice their opinions on cam-
pus, some students like LSA
sophomore Michelle Rubin
are annoyed by their methods.
However, she said she recogniz-
es the protestors' right to free
speech.
"I do think it shouldbe allowed,
because of freedom of speech, but
I still don't like it," Rubin said.
"It's not a nice atmosphere to
walk through everyday."
LSA junior Weixiang Zhang
said he views the protestors with
a jocular attitude and as a way to
develop collegial cohesion.
"(The protestors) seem to
be enjoying the show," Zhang
said. "The really funny thing
about this is that it brings people

empower authorities to detain
people without charge and curb
strikes and protests.
As part of their campaign, the
activists swamped the military
council's official Facebook page

Others called for a rally of

Bloomberg staff
claims Haggerty
used campaign
money to buy house
NEW YORK (AP) - A politi-
cal consultant accused of steal-
ing more than $1 million from
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has
been turned into a scapegoat by
mayoral staffers eager to distance
themselves from unsavory cam-
paign practices, a defense lawyer
told jurors Monday as the consul-
tant's criminal trial began.
"There is fraud here, but it's
campaign fraud by Mr. Bloom-
berg and his people," lawyer Ray-
mond Castello said in his opening
statement at . John Haggerty's
trial.
Haggerty is accused of taking
the mayor's money to underwrite
an elaborate 2009 poll-watching
effort but then mounting only a
meager operation and using most
of the cash to buy his father's
house. The mayor's representa-
tives have said that his campaign
broke no laws and followed stan-
dard practices. Prosecutors have
not accused him of wrongdoing.
But the defense told Manhat-
tan jurors Monday that the case

would revolve around the billion-
aire mayor, and they sought to
paint a picture of a self-financed
candidate surrounded by loyal-
ists who skirted campaign rules,
blurred the line between the pub-
lic and private sphere and didn't
hesitate to bend the law to Bloom-
berg's benefit.
"This case is about winning
at all costs. That's what Michael
Bloomberg is all about," Castello
told the jurors. "He spent over
$100 million to win his third term
as mayor of New York City. And
he did not want to lose."
Prosecutors gave a less dra-
matic accounting of events, say-
ing that Haggerty had outlined
plans to provide more than 1,300
poll-watchers and instead pock-
eted hundreds of thousands of
dollars and executed a cover-up
after questions were raised by a
reporter.
Haggerty didn't have the
money tobuy his father's house,
but he did have "access to one of
the largest mayoral campaigns
this city has ever seen.... And with
it, the mayor's money," Manhat-
tan Assistant District Attorney
Brian Weinberg told the jurors.
The case could prove to be
uncomfortable for the mayor, who
is expected to testify. It stands to
provide a rare peek behind the

scenes of the $109 million effort
that won the Democrat-turned-
Republican-turned-unaffiliated
candidate his third term at City
Hall. Attorneys said that Bloom-
berg's first deputy mayor, Patricia
Harris, would be among several
staffers called to testify.
Castello called into question
the motivations of the Bloomberg
employees, saying they had all
been granted immunity by pros-
ecutors.
"Mr. Bloomberg has paid or is
paying large sums of money to
almost every witness who is tes-
tifying," the lawyer said.
A Bloomberg spokesman said
Monday that the mayor has done
nothing wrong.
"The person accused of break-
ing the law in this trial is Mr.
Haggerty, who the evidence will
show stole money from Mayor
Bloombergthrough outright lies,"
said Jason Post. "Mr. Haggerty
and his legal team are prepared to
say anything to avoid prison."
Former Deputy Mayor Kevin
Sheekey testified Monday that
he had asked Haggerty to handle
poll watching for the 2009 cam-
paign. Bloomberg donated $1.2
million to the state independence
Party, which agreed to pay Hag-
gerty $1.1 million for the effort,
prosecutors said.

others have been motivated by
personal grievances.
The assailant in Sunday eve-
ning's shooting was killed, and it
was not yet clear if he acted alone
or if he belonged to an insurgent
group.
A U.S. official in Washington
said the Afghan attacker was
providing security to the CIA
office and that the American
who died was working as a con-
tractor for the CIA. The official
requested anonymity because he
was speaking about intelligence
matters.
The CIA declined to comment.
Gunfire was first heard some-
time after 8 p.m. local time
around the former Ariana Hotel,
a building that ex-U.S. intelli-
gence officials said is the CIA
station in Kabul. The spy agency
occupied the heavily secured
building, which is just blocks
away from the Afghan presiden-
tial palace, in late 2001 after the
U.S.-led invasion that toppled
the Taliban.
The U.S. Embassy acknowl-
edged that an Afghan employee
of the complex carried out the
attack.
"The motivation for the attack
is still under investigation," the
embassy said in a statement.
Embassy spokesman Gavin
Sundwall declined to comment
on what the targeted annex was
used for, citing security rea-
sons. Sundwall said the Afghan
employee was not authorized to
carry a weapon, and it was not
clear how the man was able to
get a gun into the secured com-
pound.
The embassy did not provide
information on the American
who was killed, and said the per-
son wounded in the shootingwas
taken to a military hospital with
injuries that were not life-threat-
ening. It said the embassy has
"resumed business operations."
The attack came less than
two weeks after militants fired
rocket-propelled grenades and
assault rifles at the U.S. Embassy,
NATO headquarters and other
buildings in Kabul, killing seven
Afghans. No embassy or NATO
staff members were hurt in the
20-hour assault. But it plunged
U.S.-Pakistan relations to new
lows as U.S. officials accused
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intel-
ligence agency of supporting
insurgents in planning and exe-
cuting the Sept. 13 attack.
Nearly 80 American soldiers
were wounded and two Afghan
civilians were killed in a truck
bombing targeting an American
base in eastern Afghanistan on
Sept. 10. American officials also
blamed that attack on insur-
gents from the Haqqani network
who are allegedly supported by
Pakistani intelligence. Senior
Pakistani officialsreject the alle-
gations.

Sunday's assault also follows
closely on last week's assassina-
tion of former Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was
leading a government effort to
broker peace with the Taliban.
He was killed when an insurgent
claiming to be a peace emissary
detonated a bomb hidden in his
turban upon meeting Rabbani.
President Hamid Karzai
called Rabbani's death a "big
loss" and said greater security
measures should be taketo pro-
tect top Afghan figures, lclud-
ing religious clerics and tribal
leaders. A government spokes-
man said the man who brought
the suicide bomber to Kabul has
been arrested.
NATO bases and embassies
have ramped up security fol-
lowing a number of attacks over
the past year by Afghan secu-
rity forces against their coun-
terparts. Since March 2009, the
coalition has recorded at least
20 incidents where a member
of the Afghan security forces or
someonewearingauniformused
by them killed coalition forces.
Thirty-six coalition troops have
died in the attacks. It is not
known how many of the 282,000
members of the Afghan security
forces were killed.
In December2009, an al-Qai-
da double agent blew himself up
at a CIA base in eastern Khost
province, killing seven CIA
employees.
The attacker, a Jordanian
man named Humam al-Balawi,
had been brought into the base
because he claimed to be able to
reach high-level al-Qaida lead-
ers.
Meanwhile, political ten-
sions between Afghanistan and
Pakistan continued to mount
Monday. The Afghan Foreign
Ministry warned that relations
with its neighbor will suffer if
cross-border artillery attacks
hitting eastern Afghanistan con-
tinue.
The Afghan government has
said that an unknown number of
Afghancivilianshavebeenkilled
by the shelling coming from
Pakistani territory in recent
days. The attacks have allegedly
destroyed several houses and
mosques and displaced hundreds
of people.
The Foreign Ministry quoted
Mohammad Sadeq, Pakistan's
ambassador in Kabul, as saying
that the attacks were not inten-
tional and that he regretted the
killings and the destruction of
property.
The Afghan censure comes
as U.S. officials have sharpened
their missives to Pakistan over
the past week, drawing more
direct lines between the govern-
ment and the Haqqani network,
which is affiliated with the Tali-
ban and al-Qaida and is often
blamed for attacks in Kabul.

Baseball isn't exactly our gener-

. consumption and Showcase
Whereas profes-
sional football Columbia
is in-your-face
consistent action and basket-
ball is a fluid, patterned sport
with moment-to-moment excite-
ment, baseball is a sport that
exists somewhat under its own
tradition-laced surface. It's hard
to watch baseball without a solid
understanding of the sport itself
- namely, the acronyms, stats and
lingo that serve sports anoouno-,
ers in their nightly broadcasts and
give the sport an off-the-field ele-
ment of excitement.
"Moneyball" exposes anoth-
er side of the sport, looking at
America's pastime from behind
the scenes of a franchise trying to
rebuild itself: the 2002 Oakland
Athletics (the A's). Based on the
Michael Lewis book "Moneyball:
The Art of Winning an Unfair
Game," the film follows Athlet-
ics General Manager Billy Beane
(Brad Pitt, "Tree of Life") and his
efforts to create a team on par with
big-money teams like the Yankees
and Red Sox with less than a third
of their budget.
The film starts not a second
too early, profiling the A's Ameri-

can League Division Series loss to
the Yankees in 2001, followed by
the loss of three of their biggest
players - Johnny Damon, Jason
Giambi and Jason Ingringhau-
sen - to free agency and eventu-
ally to bigger market teams. Faced
with the insurmountable chal-
lenge of rebuilding the team with
meager funds, Beane encounters
Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, "Cyrus"),
a young baseball analyst who
encourages the GM to find under-
valued players and hire them
based purely on sabermetric stats
and numbers, with no consider-
ation for players' prestige or pre-
dictions of the old-boy in-house
analysts - a team of50-plus veter-
ans the A's organization employs
to assist the GM.
The journey of the A's 2002 sea-
son is an engrossing look at howa
few people revolutionize the game
- the drama of "Moneyball" is the
tough road to change a sport both
celebrated and maligned as Amer-
ica's oldest.
The film becomes Beane's fight
againstthe system. Bestowed with
$40 million of unilateral power, he
quickly starts picking up players
he and Brand identify as underval-
ued - cheap players who will pro-
duce on the field, and diamonds
in the rough who aren't even on
other teams' radars. The theoreti-
cal basis for the process seems so
fitting for agame already analyzed
so heavily in numbers, but when
the 2002 season starts, it quickly
unravels.
The film has a talky, docu-
mentary feel that rarely diverts
into actual gameplay. The script
was adapted by Steven Zaillian
("American Gangster") and re-
drafted by Aaron Sorkin ("The
Social Network"). The latter
writer's style is evident in the
natural, fluid dialogue throughout
the based-on-a-true-story film.

It appropriately lacks the stylism
of "The Social Network" but con-
tains many of the same charms as
that 2010 film - "Moneyball" lin-
gers on some moments longerthan
others, allowing the viewer to feel
his or her own distance from, the
onscreen characters, but also
offering a realistic glimpse into
the human drama surrounding
something that may appear decid-
edly non-human at first.
At the same time, the film may
be too slow for some. Don't expect
"Moneyball" to be a "sports
movie" in the vein of "The Natu-
ral" - in practice, the film is much
more about running a business
than playing a game, contextual-
izing the romanticism of baseball
within the non-romantic aspects
of salaries and player cuts.
Billy Beane is shown as a busi-
nessman firmly entrenched in the
back end of the sport, distancing
himself from the sport and his
players. He keeps himself emo-
tionally disconnected from a sport
that, when he was a player in the
1980s, left him out in the cold. Pitt
plays him pretty close to his own
wheelhouse - Beane is the most
confident man in the room. Pitt
takes him deeper, though, expos-
ing another side of the character,
who in private moments exhib-
its the same insecurities of some
of the players he brings into the
team.
"Moneyball," like Sorkin's other
writing efforts, connects back on
itself in textbook fashion.:It's not
bombastic or loud, but it leaves a
lasting impact on the sport it pro-
files while exposing the human
drama behind the numbers of
baseball. "Moneyball" is the 21st
century baseball story, one in
which talent and determination
can triumph over the tradition,
convention and money that have
become the game's foundation.

pleasure of the album - how
pleasant it is, how loud it is in
its quietness, etc. But there in
my head asI finish Cadagin's
last paragraph is Merzbow,
the veritable Japanese God of
Noise. It seemed to me at the
time, that he's just as shibumi
as Stan Getz and Gilberto/
Jobim. There's a body-high,
sensory hypnotism to his cre-
ations that's so anti-aesthetic,
anti-melody and anti-music it
practically redefines shibumi.
Less is more versus more is less
... what, between silence and
noise, is left?
So much of the music I seek
out is music that achieves my
own set of personal aesthetic
criteria, my own personal
shibumi. This is the social the-
ory of uses and gratifications
at its basest level - we listen to
music that pleases, comforts or
moves us. We listen to a song
for a few seconds and if it hits
that high and personal water-
mark, we grant it 2011's most
valuable commodity: our per-
sonal time.
A lot of the popular indepen-
dent music being traded on the
Internet now is almost radically
innocuous. Coming out of dorm
rooms and laptops, so much of
it sounds adamantly intimate
and aesthetically pleasant. It
s9unds nice. And the backlash
cycle (now faster than ever -
instantaneous, even) has been
quick to accuse this music
(chillwave, coldwave, to-fi,
what have you) not of badness,
but of something even worse:

boredom. Some of it is right-
fully condemned, while much
of it is casually and unfairly
dismissed.
In this golden age of avail-
ability (how long can it last?),
we have the opportunity to
hear just about anything we
want. The ultimate insult to
any new artist or music would
be that it is "boring" - it isn't
worth our precious, dollar-on-
the-minute time.
But assessing boredom is
tough to do. It's the challenge I
go through in evaluating plenty
of films. Take Terrence Malick's
movies, for instance. On one
hand, they're monumentally
empty, dull and histrionic.
On the other, they're hugely
personal and possibly medium-
defying - we're uncomfortable
with how slowly they move and
how little they regard our per-
sonal sense of aesthetics. We
are forced to accept them on
our own terms - and maybe we
are rewarded for letting them
stretch our aesthetic limits.
I personally think there are
plenty of better directors we
can pick for this value, but my
question is this: Are we afraid
of boredom?
There is the need, I think, for
any artistic medium to be sub-
versive and foster subversive
content, to redefine priorities
and conceptions, to color them
in a new way. But there is just
as much a need for music that
is radically quiet - that pushes
the boundary of what popular
form is, while meeting it in the
void between what appeals to
us and what scares us.
Somewhere in us, there's a
borderline or a gap between
which our taste weighs music
on a Libra scale. Unfortunately,
that gap seems, for so many
people, to be thoroughly stuck in
that traditional Western scale. If
we are pushed to exist outside of
what comforts us, we may reject
it. This brings free jazz to mind,
with wholesale rejections of
musicians like Ornette Coleman
(whose Dancing in Your Head
proceeds to do exactly that) or
John Coltrane (whose music has

its own damn religion) as they
branched out of the established
tenets of jazz into something
wholly new, wholly undefined
and aesthetics-free.
Some called it crap, some a
revelation. Others called it dull.
But maybe it's time for us
to reassess boredom. There is
too much music now for us to
consume it all. We owe it to
ourselves to consider the limits
of our personal aesthetics and
abolish them with equal speed.
Crying "boredom" is an easy
out. Not of all of the world's
music is going to meet our prim
and trim standards, and plenty
of it doesn't merit our time. But
rejecting music without giving
it the time of day does our taste
no favors. It's only us, standing
in the face of all this noise and
refusing to listen.
Behind all
the 'wave'
genres, there's
substance, too.
Cadagin touched on Mark
Rothko's paintings as well,
which, to me, are emblematic
of this divide. Upon viewing
them, audiences surely declared
them tepid - their artistic stan-
dards collided with something
radically free and uncomfortably
shibumi. Within those chromatic
masses are borders, spaces and
shades of a spiritual depth the
casual eye could glance and
dismiss with a shrug. The first
time I listened to Merzbow, I
shrugged it off as noise. I listened,
closer. And after nine minutes of
teeth grinding, I began to hear
contours where boredom called
it quits. And I actually found
myself laughing, hypnotized ... as
my stubborn old defenses slowly
and surely eroded.

Hoke, 'M' get first look at Little Brown Jug

STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
At 107 years old, the Little
Brown Jug predates even the for-
ward pass.
The Jug, which is awarded to
the winner of the game between
the Michigan and Minnesota
football teams,
hasn't seen NOTEBOOK
daylight since
the teams played in 2008. With
another edition of college foot-
ball's oldest trophy game coming
Saturday, the rivalry might need a
kick-start.
So Michigan coach Brady Hoke
re-emphasized the importance of
the game during the 19th-ranked
Wolverines' team meeting Sun-
day night.
"It's an important part of the
legacy of Michigan," Hoke said.
Hoke had equipment manager
Jon Falk wheel the Jug in on a
cart. The players were given "Vic-
tors' manuals," which had a page
dedicated to documenting the
history of the Michigan-Minne-
sota rivalry, as senior tight end
Kevin Koger explained.
The players hadn't seen the
trophy since beating the Golden
Gophers, 29-6, at the Metrodome
in 2008.
"(The rivalry game) a big part
of our tradition," said fifth-year
senior defensive tackle Ryan

Van Bergen. "That's what makes
Michigan what it is, that it has
these little things that we've been
a part of for so long."
The legend of the Jug famously
began in 1903 when Michigan
coach Fielding Yost allegedly
believed Gopher fans would con-
taminate the water supply. So
Yost sent a student manager to
purchase a five-gallon jug..
After the game ended in a 6-6
tie, Michiganstormedhome,leav-
ing the jug. Yost later demanded it
be returned, but L.J. Cooke, head
of Minnesota's athletic depart-
ment wrote, "If you want it, you'll
have to win it."
Yost won it back in 1909. More
than a century later, the Wolver-
ines hold a commanding 66-22-3
all-time record. But the Jug isn't
much of a looker.
"It's good to see the old ugly
jug," fifth-year senior center
David Molk said.
It's still a five-gallon jug, but it's
not brown anymore and it hasn't
held water inyears.
"You kind of picture in your
mind what it looks like, but when
you see it up close, it's not the
most beautiful jug you've ever
seen," Van Bergen said. "For fans
who've never been close to it, I
don't think you'd ever want to
drink any water out of that.
"You can tell by looking at the
thing that it's been around a long,

right thing to do."
Minnesota Athletic Director
Joel Maturi told the Pioneer Press
(St. Paul) that he was unsure
when the coach would return,
and that there is no timetable set.
Understandably, Kill may miss
the game at Michigan Stadium
this weekend.
"Jerry and I competed against
each other at the MAC level,"
Hoke said. "He and his wife
Rebecca are two of the finest
people you'll ever be around. Our
prayers for him and his family are
there. He's a great person and a
terrific coach."
Hoke knows the Minnesota job
even better than most. He was
contacted by the Gophers late last
November to gauge his interest in
filling the void left when former
coach Tim Brewster was fired.
When asked Monday if he was
ever interested in the job, Hoke
said he never was. When asked
how formal his discussions ere,
he refused to speak of it.
INJURY UPDATE: Fifth-year
senior cornerback Troy Woolfolk
has been hampered by ankle and
handj injuries. He went down on
Saturday with a left ankle injury,
but Hoke said he practiced Sun-
day and is day-to-day.
Redshirt junior guard Ricky
Barnum went down early with
an ankle injury against San Diego
State.
