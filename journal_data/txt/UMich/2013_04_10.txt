SUSTAINABILITY
Group pushes
for sustainable
cleaning spray

Class aids with
transition to
liquid ozone
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
DailyStaffReporter
For their final project in
Environment 391: Sustain-
ability and the Campus, LSA
and Art & Design senior Alicia
Chiaravalli, LSA senior Logan
Chadde and LSA junior Jessie
Fletcher are working to raise
awareness and to help complete
the transition to using liquid-
ozone cleaner in the Univer-
sity's dorms.
Liquid ozone is a chemical-
free product created by combin-
ing an additional oxygen atom
to oxygen and water molecules
to form a molecule that reacts
quickly with dirt and other pol-
lutants. The cleaner is produced
by running water through a
machine that charges it for two
to four hours. The projects were
proposed by University staff
sponsors and chosen by students

in the course.
The University first used
liquid ozone as a cleaner in
2010. The product was first
piloted in South Quad Resi-
dence Hall, and since then has
been implemented in several
dorms and buildings around
campus.
"Our goals are to help with
the transition more than any-
thing," Fletcher said. "There is a
big sustainability movement on
campus and most students don't
even know about liquid ozone.
We want students to know that
their dorms are turning more
sustainable."
Chadde said liquid ozone can
be produced on-site and saves
the University about 50 percent
on cleaning costs.
"This is a pretty unique
product," Chadde said. "We're
the first university in the coun-
try to implement it. Universi-
ties from around the world
have contacted our university
about how to implement liquid
ozone."

Daily StaffReporter
In stark contrast to its
"UGLi" neighbor - the Shap-
iro Undergraduate Library -
the Clements Library is known
not only for its extensive col-
lections, but also its intricate

architecture: much of the build-
ing retains its original, 1923
design and construction.
The Library will be relocat-
ing four miles away to Ellsworth
Road in August in preparation
for its two year, $16.8-million
refurbishment which is set to
begin in February 2014.
"Most of the work that needs
to be done is wiring, plumbing,
electrical - just bringing the
building into the 21st century,"
Graffagnino said. "We'll take
care of cosmetic details as well -

like the peeling paint - making
everything the best itcan be."
Graffagnino added that the
reading room will be moved
from its original basement loca-
tion to the main room, which he
said will feel "like you're study-
ing in St. Peter's (Basilica)"
because of its high ceilings and
intricate decor.
The main undertaking
will be the construction of an
underground addition between

Dorm raid rumor causes panic

E
I

Several hours of panic ensued
an the University of Virginia on
Tuesday after a rumor spread
across campus that police were
randomly searching dorm rooms
for alcohol, The Cavalier Daily
reported.
The rumor allegedly origi-
nated from a personal prank
between two students over
social media. Word of the alleged
searches quickly circulated to the
rest of the student body and uni-
versity officials.
The university urged resi-
dent advisors to caution students
against letting suspicious indi-
viduals into their rooms. Several
hours after the initial report, the
dean of students and local author-

ities both dismissed the rumor in
statements issued to the student
body.
BERKELEY STUDENTS
CALL FOR FOSSIL FUELS
DIVESTMENT
The Associated Students of the
University of California, Berke-
ley are calling for the university's
administration no divest portions
of the school's endowment from
companies that produce and
manage fossil fuels, The Daily
Californian reported Monday.
The ASUC has proposed the
divestment initiative through a
ballot referendum in the upcom-
ing student' assembly elections.

The author of the hill hopes to
send a "political statement,"
although some opponents of the
initiative claim it will hinder the
university's ability no provide
affordable education.
The ASUC is workingnto divest
ins own fossil fuel investments,
-which currently total about $3
million. However, membersunoted
that the university is "very non-
transparent" with ins investment
holdings, presenting difficulty in
knowing exactly how much the
University of California, Berkeley
and the University of California
system as a whole have already
invested in fossil fuels.

Chrysler Group LLC is recall-
ing more than 247,000 SUVs

including faulty gas tank hoses,

warning lights that illuminate
when there's no problem.
The largest of the recalls,

U.S. air force to

The U.S. Air Force plans
to ground about a third of its

planes and a top general warned
Tuesday that the branch might
not be able to respond immedi-
ately to every event when need-
ed.
The Air Force didn't immedi-
ately release a list of the specific
units and bases that would be
affected on Tuesday, but it said
it would cover some fighters,
bombers and airborne warning
and control aircraft in the U.S.,
Europe and the Pacific.
Gen. Mike Hostage, com-

at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in
Virginia, said the branch would

units supporting major missions,
like the war in Afghanistan,

South Korea holds
North responsible
for cyberattack
South Korea says an initial
investigation has found that
North Korean government
agents were behind a March
cyberattack that shut down
about 32,000 computers and
servers at South Korean broad-
casters and banks.
An official at South Korea's
internet security agency, Chun
Kil-soo, told reporters Wednes-
day that the attack was similar
to past North Korean hacking.
He said investigators believe
that six computers in North
Korea were used to access South

TEAM
From Page1A
Michigan basketball back on the
map," freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III said, acknowledg-
ing a goal accomplished with
this season.
The comments highlighted
successes, not failures.
"Unfortunately we didn't get
the win yesterday, but we got a
lot to be proud of," sophomore
guard Trey Burke said.
Dressed in their Adidas attire
- with "WE ON" and "Leave It
All On The Floor" painted across
their shirts - the players seemed
somber and ready to be back.
Burke laughed and smiled with
senior guard Eso Akunne as the
other players spoke, and fresh-
man guard Spike Albrecht was
the target of jokes.
"I'll try to be quick so you
guys can hear from the legend,
Spike Albrecht," senior guard
Matt Vogrich said.
After Albrecht addressed
the crowd - receiving a stand-
ing ovation from the team
after introducing himself -
Beilein had one last request:
for the team's captain, senior
guard Josh Bartelstein, to
lead the team and the crowd
in "Hail to the Victors" with
the help of Burke, Akunne and
Hardaway.
"I think these guys are cham-
pions in so many ways," Beilein
said.
Everyone sang, everyone
clapped and everyone went
through the motions. But after
the song was over - one of the
last times Team 96 will sing the
fight song in Crisler in front of a
crowd - they moved toward the
exit while the crowd cheered on.
They were readyto go.
"It's good; it's nice. We've
been gone a long time, but we're
all happy to be back," Albrecht
said after the event.
The freshmen looked back on
the entire journey rather than
the very end.
"We had some incredible
games: I mean, our game against
Kansas, Trey hitting that shot,
ourwin over Syracuse," Albrecht
said. "There were a lot of high-
points in that tournament, and
we fell a little bit short, but it
didn't take away from the suc-
cess of the entire season."
ForHardaway, comingbackto
Crisler was an emotional experi-
ence.
"It means the world just to see
our fans out there, and it's very,
very emotional when they're
here, cheering for you even after
a loss, so, I mean, it takes a lot
of toughness just to see that,"
Hardaway said. "We're very
emotional right now."
And while the NBA rumors
swirl around his career, Hard-
away said he isn't thinking about
the draft.
"I'm just reflecting on the
season, talking to a lot of people
and everyone's talking about the
NBA, but I'm not really focused
on that right now," he said. "I'm
focused on this season, what

happened and what this team
can get better at."
McGary cited the freedom to
go to class and relax as what he's
looking forward to, and Beilein
agreed.
"It's been four straight week-
ends on the road, and I think we
all need a sense of normalcy,"
Beilein said. "Believe it or not,
they want to go back to catch
up with classes, and we all have
exams and we have a lot that's
going on, but I'm really proud
with the way they conducted
themselves."
Though the players turned a
blind eye to the media through-
out the tournament - McGary
was unaware of an article on
Buzzfeed suggesting he is a
wizard - Beilein called out
Albrecht's tweet to model Kate
Upton duringthe event.
"Spike is so big right now that
Kate Upton asked him out for a
date and he said he's too busy,"
Beilein said.
The team is back in Ann
Arbor, but when the media asked
if Michigan basketball was
back, mixed reviews came from
McGary and Hardaway.
"I think so. We got back to the
national stage, and it got us back
on top," McGary said.
"Honestly, we got alotofwork
to do, but it's definitely moving
in the right direction," Hard-
away added.
Albrecht pointed out that the
team meets again tomorrow.
"Itwas alongseason - we had
a lot to be proud of - but we have
a meetingtomorrow with Coach
Beilein and the other coaches,
and they're goingto tellus where
we go from here," he said.
University alum Jameel Syed,
a resident of Auburn Hills,
Mich., was the first to enter
Crisler at 2 p.m. for the event
with his 11-year-old son, Jibril,
who was decked in a maize
"Burke" jersey. He took work
off early and pulled Jibril out of
school for what he considered a
once in a lifetime opportunity to
see the team together. Syed, who
grew up in Ann Arbor, said he
has watched Michigan athletics
his whole life. But in Team 96, he
found something special.
"I had to come out here today
because this is the last time this
group is ever going to be assem-
bled, and it's avery special group
of people," Syed said. "And I was
born and raised here, so I've
seen a lot of people come and a
lot of people go, and I haven't
seen this."
Syed planned to be at Crisler
for the team's homecoming win
or lose.
"There were so many lessons
here from a life perspective, let
alone athletics," Syed said. "I
think everybody appreciates
the fact that every single one
of those people - the starters,
the people off the bench - had
something to contribute, and
they fought so hard. And some-
times it turns out this way - that
you don't win - but honestly,
there's so many lessons to learn
from that, and the biggest one is:
Michigan is back."

student organizations.
"We do walks around the city
and teach people about zoning
by analyzing properties in Ann
Arbor," Kong said. "Next fall
we plan to do voter registration
drives and large events."
Kong said there hasbeen inter-
est from students in running for
office, but the party - which is
especially looking for candidates
to run for Ward 4 - has not yet
settled on candidates.
Though they stand to greatly
benefit from the party's goals,
the group is not exclusive to
Greek life members or students
living in Co-Ops, Kong said.
Michael Freedman, the presi-
dentofthe Interfraternity Council,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
a speaker came to talk to chap-
ter presidents regarding running
for the open spots on the council.
Freedman forwarded information
regarding the party to a group of
students involved in the IFC.
Freedman wrote that IFC is
not affiliated with the Mixed Use
Party, but notes there are ben-
efits to having Greek students
represented on the council.
"(It is) not a mission for the
IFC to have Greek affiliation

wrote. "However, we are not dis-

Graffagnino said the renova-
tion plans were designed specifi-
callyso thatthebuilding'soverall
look will remain the same.
"The architecture of thisbuild-
ing is one of the treasures on cam-
pus; it has to look like this when
it's finished," he said. "After 90
years we've outgrown this space
and it's a beautiful old building,
but it needs to be fixed up."
Graffagnino emphasized that
the services the library currently
offers, including access to their
collections and references, will
continue during their renovation,
which is invaluable to the 1,200
people, mostly University students,
who use the libraryeveryyear.
Though originally the library
had very strict guidelines for
who could access the collections,
Graffangnino said it has become

couraging it neither."
An e-mail sent to some IFC
members claimed that the city's
zoning laws unfairly discrimi-
nate against fraternities and
sororities, using language that
does not apply to off-campus
residents. The group cited
restrictions on lot sizes for fra-
ternity and sorority housing as
one example.
The City Code of Ann Arbor
states that fraternities and
sororities are not allowed in the
RI, R2A and R3 districts, which
make up a large part of student
housing areas surrounding cam-
pus. The Mixed Use Party takes
issue with this.
"These restrictions prevent fra-
ternities and sororities from using
medium and small buildings," the
e-mail stated. "Delta Chi frater-
nity has only 4,990 square feet,

Houses like Tau Kappa Epsilon,

fraternities and sororities look-
ing for houses and makes housing
more expensive."
"Because adequate safety
and noise regulations already
exist for all residents, the above
restrictions are unnecessary and
the Mixed Use Party will abolish
them," the e-mail further states.
Students have been dissuaded
in the pastfromrunning for seats
on the City Council considering
much more inclusive over the
past 40 years.
"What makes the Clements
Library unique is that a student
can come in to use the reading
room and sit alongside the next
Pulitzer Prize winner from Har-
vard or Yale coming to use the
collections," he said. "This is a
public university, and service to
the faculty and the students of
our campus is a very serious part
of our mission."
Though the Library special-
izes in early American histori-
cal texts, Graffagnino said it
assists students from more than
20 different departments every
academic year, as it contains
material pertaining to many his-
tory or humanities fields.
Graffagnino added that while
the library prides itself on hav-
ing "the original stuff," it would
be a "shirking of responsibility
in the electronic age" to not digi-
tize its material.
"When you're using a George
Washington letter, you're hold-
ing the original in your hands,
and the real thrill of it for most

the limited time they will be liv-
ing in the city. The recent redis-
tricting of the wards - dividing
the downtown and campus areas
where students housing is usu-
ally located - has also caused
problems for student candidates
who will have a harder time
gaining the majority of votes.
Kong said he thinks the divi-
sions open more opportunities
for students.
"The ward system spreads out
students and makes it difficult for
students to gain a seat without a
large effort, but for the same rea-
son, if we do a particularly good
job organizing, we can win in
multiple wards," Kong said.
City Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman - whose seat may be
challenged by the party - said
he thinks candidates for council
should care about a variety of
issues in the city, and he looks
forward to students utilizing
their democratic right.
"I believe council members
should care about a wide variety of
issues engaging in the community
including students," Kunselman
said. "That said, I think the politi-
cal process is a public good and I
would encourage themto do so."
Kong said the party is hoping
to settle on candidates by May.
Those running for a seat on the
council must turn in their peti-
tion with 100 signatures by May
14, 2013.
people is that history is right in
front of you,"he said. "We can put
it on the computer, which means
you can use it in your dorm at two
in the morning, but nothing can
compare to the originals."
Regardless of the medium,
Graffagnino said he believes the
library offers a unique experi-
ence for University students.
"You have to do the unique
things on this campus, so, I tell
people, 'Come to Michigan, go
to the Big House, watch football
games,' but you can only do this
in American history here," he
said. "What Mr. Clements creat-
ed, and what we've maintained,
is a library that's absolutely
world class, and the best in the
world for American history."
Graffagnino said he believes the
renovation will only increase the
library's value withinthe University.
"For people that have an inter-
est, this is a treasure," he said.
"We'll continue to add to the
collections and the strengths
that we already have, while mak-
ing the experience better for all
those who use the library.

launched a focus group in Burs-
ley Residence Hall where Uni-
versity employees could discuss
their experiences with and opin-
ions on liquid ozone.
Director of Housing Facilities
Victoria Hueter pitched the proj-
ect.
"Liquid ozone as a cleaning
product is not normal," Hueter
said. "It doesn't have color or
scent. It doesn't bubble up when
you scrub it. It looks just like
water ... It doesn't smell like it's
working, but it is."
"You don't have your normal
indicators that it's working," she
added. "People were saying, 'You.
want us to clean with water?

How does this really work?"'
However, Hueter explains
that Housing used a special,
biology-based test to prove
that the liquid ozone was an
effective cleaner. The test,
called an "adenosine triphos-
phate meter test," measured
the amount of adenosine tri-
phosphate, or ATP, before and
after cleaning. ATP is a mol-
ecule used as a form of energy
currency in most organisms,
including germs, so the change
in ATP areas cleaned with liq-
uid ozone have fewer number
of living organisms than before
cleaned with liquid ozone or
cleaned with a chemical clean-
ing product.
Sam Johnson, a custodian
in the Michigan union, said he
prefers liquid ozone more than

chemical cleaner.
"Using harsher chemicals
that we had before, you take that
whiff home with you; you smell
it, you taste it," Johnson said. He
said a drawback it its two-hour
lifespan.
Mike Shriberg, a lecturer
who teaches the course, said his
Environment 391 course is pop-
ular among students.
Shriberg emphasized the
importance of hands-on group
projects in the class like the liq-
uid ozone experiment.
"We are hardwired to learn
by doing," he said. "This
course is a prime example of
that ... There are no tests in the
.course, but to actually take a
project from start to finish is
a big deal and big responsibil-
ity."

been struggling their whole life
and had to really work harder
to work past th eir disabil-
ity," Jennifer LaRusso-Leung,
engagement manager for the
fellowship, said. "The great
thing is they're sitting in class
with you at some of these top
schools, so they really are very
intelligent students who are
trying to persevere."
At the end of each August,
40 students are chosen to go
to New York City to be inter-
viewed. Half of the interview-
ees move on and receive career
advising as part of the fellow-
ship.
A primary focus of the pro-
gram is to help students boost
confidence about obtaining
desired employment opportu-
nities. Students gain support
and make friendships through-
out the experience, but they
also are part of a professional-
training network.
"The goal is to prepare them
for internships, connect them
for the internships and, at the
end of the day, to help them
be successful in those roles so
that they can get a full time
offer upon graduation," Lang
explained.
While the coaching lasts only
five days, those selected to be
part of the program will always

be considered a fellow. Alumni
fellows also continue to act
as mentors after participants
graduate.
No individual with a dis-
ability should be discouraged
to apply if they are interested,
Lang said. Even if they are not
selected to be fellows, all of the
finalists still have the ability to
be in the Lime Network.
At the fellowship's annual
symposium held in August, the
group of fellows gathers togeth-
er to share stories about their
experiences.
"For me, it was more about
learning about myself than
anything," Business junior
Rohit Kapur said of his Lime
Connect Fellowship experi-
ence. "A lot of people struggle
talking to others about the
problems they're facing, and
it made it so much easier for
me to talk about it. I would
say people should apply. I
mean, it helps you be more
comfortable with yourself."
LSA junior Kiki Fox, who was
accepted for the fellowship last
year, wrote in an e-mail that the
experience helped her prepare
for recruiting processes and
provides priceless networking
opportunities.
"It was great to hear about
the intricacies of each of the
internship programs at the
various companies, so we could
get a feel for which companies
might be a good fit."

Artificially intelligent writing
Essay grading systems shouldn't replace human judgment
ccording to a recent New York Times article, computerized
essay grading systems have the potential to replace human
graders for standardized essays. In a 2012 study from the
University of Akron, systems were able to grade hundreds of thou-
sands of short essays written by middle- and high-school students
in less than a minute, assigning grades that mirrored those assigned
by human graders. Now, edX, the massive online, open-course
enterprise, intends to make similar software available online for
free. While the potential to quickly grade assignments may entice
educators, caution should be exercised before schools replace cur-
rent grading systems with software. Language and style are com-
plex and difficult to measure, and universities should ensure that
English instruction prepares students for the academic and profes-
sional writing required for success.

Anant Agarwal,edX's president, claimsthat
the edX essay grading software gives feed-
back similar to that given by class instructors.
Other systems, such as e-rater, have claimed
similar results when grading short essays on
middle- and high-school level standardized
tests. However, some of these systems grade
only on "grammar, usage, mechanics, style
and organization, and development," and thus
can be duped. Les Perelman, a researcher at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
demonstrated this by submitting a grammati-
cal, well-structured, but factually incoherent
response for the short essay question to the
e-rater system. c-rater assigned Perelman's
response the highest score possible. Current
gaps in the software system suggest too many
flaws for professors to move forward with
this technology.
The edX software is based on machine learn-
ing, where it takes in about 100 scored exams
from human graders and uses that as a basis on
which to grade other exams. When evaluating
essays, graders should not consider only gram-
mar and organization, but also factual accura-
cy, argument and reasoning. Human Readers,

a group opposed to the use of essay grading
software in situations where students' futures
are at stake, has gained signatures from more
than 3,000 college professors, instructors and
teachers in support of its goals. According to
the group's website, multiple studies show the
limitations inherent in computerized grading
systems and how they incentivize superficial
aspects of writing.
In college, students should have the oppor-
tunity to develop their writing skills so that
they're prepared for a whole range of writing
tasks upon graduation. Writing and commu-
nication skills are increasingly listed among
weaknesses of students applying for jobs and
to graduate programs, and both graders and
professors must take this into account. Cur-
rently, the University requires undergradu-
ates to take two classes explicitly focused
around writing during their tenure, a First-
Year Writing Requirement class and one
fulfilling the Upper-Level Writing Require-
ment. The University should continue to
work toward securing high-quality writing
instruction that acknowledges the complexi-
ties of the English language.

saw it first on Facebook, so it
must be true.
From the old Italian tradi-
tion of "caffe
sospeso" comes
the practice of
ordering "sus-
pended" coffees
at coffee shops.
These coffees
are paid for
but not drunk. JOSEPH
Rather, they are
"suspended" or HORTON
held on reserve
for less fortu-
nate members of the community to
order later and drink for free.
After a bit of investigation
beyond Facebook, I'm satisfied that
the practice exists at least on some
level, and however wide or narrow-
ly spread, I'm convinced the spirit
of suspended coffees is good for
Ann Arbor.
First, I know that well-meaning
intentions do exist. When I ask my
students to write personal nar-
ratives, a number of essays every
semester - written by students
from hometowns large and small
- detail encounters with panhan-
dling and homelessness in Ann
Arbor as raw and unsettling. Who
am I, goes the common question, as
a fortunate student studying at this
esteemed University, to pass on by?
And if I stop, if I engage, how much
interaction or change is enough?
How much charity is enough? Can
I ever do enough?
Second, suspended coffees,
despite the odd name and European
birthplace, aren't a particularly for-
eign concept. We've been asked to
donate money for good causes when
we check out of stores before, and
we've seen restaurant walls filled
with stickers and signs noting past
donations. This coffee thought-
fulness, however, begins with the
customer. We, coffee-drinkers of
the city, decide when we are feeling
generous; we decide when we want

to give a little back. I like the idea of
taking ownership of our pleasures
and our vices, and I like appreciat-
ing that our daily routines, down
to their smallest moments, can
have meaning.
What's more, though I'd like to
think that the coffee shops in town
would be happy to lend their sup-
port - particularly, say, Espresso
Royale, headquartered here in Ann
Arbor - this charity comes with
bill in hand. We, not the companies
we frequent, are the driving force
of change. We, with money in hand
and without prompting, are capable
of thinking not just of ourselves.
The customer isn't always right,
but maybe the charitable custom-
er, eyeing a small and imminently
attainable goal, is.
Now, I know I'm talking about
coffee, and not about so many of the
necessities that many members of
our community go without: food,
clothing and shelter, and for that
matter, medical care, legal represen-
tation and political voice. There are
plenty ofnaysayers who say suspend-
ed coffees either won't work or aren't
a good way of helping the needy. I
freely admit the ideais imperfect and
small-scale. But the smallness and
easiness of suspended coffees is what
interests me most. Too often in a
college town - in an educated, well-
meaning, but transient town - the
will exists, but the- follow-through
and the logistical perseverance falls
short. I believe that every graduating
class (and for that matter, every indi-
vidual student) does have the capac-
ity to change the world, but I fear
that too often world-changing is seen
as an all-or-nothing proposition: If
you can't fix everything, why even
try? On a big, problematic planet, I
worry we've outsourced solutions -
and even attempts at solutions - to
saints and diehards. Instead, I want
to believe that charity, thoughtful-
ness and decency are common skills,
and like sports or music or writing,
these skills, however inborn, must be

practiced to be kept sharp.
Lastly, and perhaps most crucially,
we're reminded that the needy drink
coffee too. Of course, not everyone
drinks coffee. Of course, coffee is not
a meal, and even during finals week,
it's notlife-sustaining. But, as anyone
who's been on a first date knows, as
anyone who's crossed from one cof-
fee shop to another directly across
the street can attest, coffee might be
as close as we get to the universal. To
talk only of providing necessities, of
deliveringfirst (and often, only)basic 4
sustenance, is also to distance us
from our fellow travelers. The more
our conversation is framed solely
as "what we take for granted" and
"what they need," the easier it is to
see the less fortunate as an entirely
different species. Coffee is an imper-
fect touchstone, but it's a valuable
reminder of what binds us together.
Coffee might be as
close as we get to
the universal.
Suspended coffees don't come
close to solving the world's problems.
They aren't a one-stop+shop.forrsup-
porting those in need. But they are
practice for greater generosity. They 4
are easy decency that brings tougher,
longer, more resonant decency clos-
er. They are, in one of our more privi-
leged spaces, a reminder of lack, and
they are, in our early-morning mind-
lessness, a reminder of possibility.
They encourage a routine of charity 4
and admit the accessibility of shared
humanity.
And if you're like me, any practice
of humanity at 8 a.m. is a good start
tothe day.

Hands down for stereotypes

In his Viewpoint ("Hand Up, hands on,"
4/3/13), LSA freshman Drake Baglietto makes a
futile attempt to "explore the cycle of poverty"
in his promotion of the student initiative Hands
Up. This initiative provides two weeks of voca-
tionaltrainingto individuals inhopesoflinking
unemployed Michiganders with jobs. Drake's
oversimplification of Michigan's unemployed
as "those that weren't able to receive the educa-
tion necessary to become an active member of
the working community" or "those that aren't
willing to put in the effort necessary to find
and maintain gainful employment" is not only
wrong, but also foolish.
Drake's have and have-not simplification is
a form of victim blaming. He ignores the insti-
tutional factors that have prevented Michigan
residents from accessing education and train-
ing. Drake also fails to account for the poor eco-
nomic decisions that have cut jobs across the
state, the housingslump that has left thousands
of people homeless and the government bailout
that further hurt Michigan's crumbling econo-
my. It wouldn't be a stretch to say his argument
blames people of lower income for Michigan's
lowunemployment rate.
Taking this "blame the poor" perspective
feeds into class stereotypes, which only fur-
ther perpetuates poverty and discrimination
while simultaneously reinforcing systems of
power and privilege. It's obvious that a lack
of motivation or unwillingness to work is
evident in all socioeconomic classes, not just
the poor. Similarly, here at the University, we
see very privileged students with high-social
capital who don't need to work hard to find
employment or economic gains. Yet laziness
in the poor manifests differently in the eyes of
society than laziness in the rich.
Moreover, attempting to depoliticize some-
thing that's inherently political fails to hold
institutions accountable and shifts the blame to
individuals. Misdiagnosing the problem as the
"unmotivated poor" ultimately fails to both fix
the problem and address the underlying causes
of unemployment.

At a panel on poverty and inequality last Fri-
day, Eve Garrow, assistant professor of social
work, discussed how it's crucial to challenge
the framework of our understanding of social
issues since they're a product of the collective
bias of our time. Garrow explained how "we
tend to fall into a cycle of feeling like we're good
people who are enlightened, but we cannot
trust our own perceptions because they come
from the knowledge production of our era." It's
crucial to constantly challenge what we think is
the truth and the role we play in iL.
As an institution that's supposed to generate
the "Leaders and Best," we need to challenge
ourselves as well as the dominant narratives
that further reinforce systems of power and
privilege. With an increasing diversity problem
on this campus and agrowing decline in minor-
ity enrollment, promoting these ideas doesn't
help to create a safe space for students who
come from less-privileged backgrounds, nor
does it reflect a comprehensive understanding
of social justice.
As students who hope to leave this institu-
tion enlightened and equipped to challenge
inequality and change the world, it's crucial
we develop a greater degree of understanding
of the opportunities we're afforded and the
responsibility we have to put forth.
We highly encourage students to make the
most of their education here at the University
and explore diversity in an effort to build a com-
prehensive understanding of the world. Take
advantage of opportunities such as the Pro-
gram on InterGroup Relations, which engages
students in meaningful dialogue on the com-
plexities of social identities while exploring
privilege, power and social justice.
Hands up for working with communities and
understanding the complexities of unemploy-
ment and poverty. Hands down for creating a
false dichotomy of poverty and reinforcing ste-
reotypes that further marginalize the poor.

Khan are LSA seniors.

I would like to start off by saying
thank you to everyone who showed
support to Ethan Michaeli and me
throughout the CSG presidential
election process. It has been hum-
bling to see how many students have
connected to our platform and rallied
behind Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services reform as well as many
other points of our platform.
' I've learned so much as I traversed
this campus, meeting students and
gatheringinputregardingyour issues
and concerns. I learned that the Uni-
versity isn't as connected and diverse
as we would like to think we are.And
even though we have 1,400 student
organizations for students to connect
to, there are still many students that
feel lost in the shuffle.
Even though Ethan and I weren't
successful, there is still much work to
be done. I promised from the begin-
ning that, no matter what, I would

still continue to work to tackle big
issues on this campus. I still believe
in and will pursue keyissues - espe-
cially CAPS reform - from our cam-
paign platform with the support of
students. In fact, I was especially
gratified that The Michigan Daily
took note of the overburdened CAPS
program and service shortcomings
in an editorial, "Funding mental
health," on April 2.
However, there are still plenty of
issues that need to be addressed. I
still plan to move forward with gain-
ing approvals and developing a Blue
Light Button for the Michigan App
to help make Michigan the safest
campus. To that end, I have already
scheduled a meeting with admin-
istrators to present our platform
issues, share the concerns we heard
from you and craft a plan to accom-
plish our goals.
Finally, I would like say thank you

to all our supporters for your input 4
throughout the process and for
your votes. Although we didn't pre-
vail in the final results of a tightly
contested election, I believe your
voices have been heard not only on
key issues, but also on the values
you place on integrity. I'm grateful
and humbled by the positive feed-
back I've received. I would love to
continue talking to students and
invite anyone interested in helping
with the initiatives to reach out.
Congratulations to all who have
secured a position in CSG. And
"Hail to the Victors," you the elec-
torate, for exercising your right to
vote and having your voice heard.
Now, it's time to join one another
and roll up our sleeves. There's
work to get done.
Scott Christopher is an
LSA and Businessljunior.

urassic Park'
keeps magic in 3-D
Re-release of

dinosaur classic as
dynamic as ever
By MAYANK MATHUR
Daily Arts Writer
The re-release of "Juras-
sic Park" in 3-D prompts a very
simple, yet essential question ...
"Why?" Why re-
release the film? A-
Won't it be the
same movie all JUraSsiC
over again? Why Park 3-D
make a trip to
the cinema to At Quality16
see a movie that and Rave
can be viewed in
the comfort of Universal
your room? Why
would a rational consumer be will-
ing to spend money for something
that can now be enjoyed for free?
Why, indeed.
Because, as a movie buff, you
are not a "rational consumer."
Because, when a T-Rex stares
right at you, you still take Dr.
Grant's advice and dare not move
a muscle. Because, watching two
velociraptors stalk two children
in a kitchen is still scary enough
to give you goosebumps. Because,
hearing the words "Welcome to
Jurassic Park" accompanied by
that ineffable music is still one of
the most magical moments you've
experienced as a viewer. Because
that shot of the T-Rex roaring in
the visitor's center as the banner
falls still screams "AWESOME."
Because, "Jurassic Park" is still
"Jurassic Park."
Relish the chance as you are
once again invited to embark on
a fantastic adventure with added
3-D effects, which completes the
experience in a truly satisfying
manner. Given thatthe filmis a re-
release, itwould be extremely sur-
prising if the original cast didn't
reprise their roles. Ride along with
familiar faces: paleontologists
Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill, "The
Hunt for Red October") and Dr.
Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern, "Every-

Womp wowsm
Miastering the macabre

He just wants to be your friend.
thing Must Go"), the charismatic
and quirky mathematician Dr. Ian
Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum, "Inde-
pendence Day") and the delusion-
al-yet-lovable John Hammond,
played by Richard Attenborough
("Joseph and the Amazing Tech-
nicolor Dreamcoat"). The plot.
remains the same throughout its
running time of two hours and
unfortunately for all hopefulfans,
the film does not contain any spe-
cial or added scenes.
The phrase "big-screen movie"
does get thrown around a lot more
than it should, and oftentimes
films are unreasonably lauded for
the added impact they have in a
movie theater. However, if there
ever was a movie meant for the big
screen, itis "Jurassic Park 3-D."
The3-Deffectscombine brilliantly
with the extraordinary CGI, add-
ing a new dimension to cinematic
experience, catapulting the thrill
of walking (sometimes, running
and screaming) with dinosaurs
to a new level. Scenes such as the
T-Rex's attack onthe occupants,
of two helpless cars in the middle
of a thunderstorm and the veloci-
raptor's assault on Dr. Sattler in
the dark of a control room base-
ment are especially riveting. If, as
a child, you weren't petrified when

the T-Rex lowered its head to
look at you through a car window,
chances are, you're going to come
out.of this movie feeling a lot dif-
ferent.
Though it might seem like a
pointless excursion, watching
"Jurassic Park 3-D" is truly a magi-
calexperience. Rightfromthefirst
scene, viewers are guaranteed to
shed their reservations and will
ultimately allow themselves to
enjoy the movie that thrilled them
as ayounger audience.
Yes, the film can be seen any-
where else for free and yes, it is
the exact same film ... but that's
what makes the experience so
special. The same story is still so
captivating and the brilliant CGI
effects still hold up to this date.
However, the most endearing
quality about this film is the sense
of joy and excitement you get as
the gates of "Jurassic Park" swing
open and Ian Malcolm remarks,
"What have they got in there,
King Kong?"
That is truly a priceless feel-
ing. So, go ahead, give yourself
a chance to enjoy what you did
as a child; you won't regret it.
Embrace the experience like
never before; just take one word
of advice: "Hold on to your butts."

When the new at 10 p.m.

"Hannibal" was
announced, the

Greenblatt and Co. prove time and

ed. Sure, the series boasts incred-
ible acting chops, but how much
more can be picked off the carcass
of the Hannibal legacy?
As a new spin, the series will
take place before the events of*
the 1981 novel "Red Dragon." In
"Hannibal," the renowned psy-
chiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Mads
Mikkelsen, "Clash of the Titans")
hasn't been caught, and the FBI
unwittingly seeks his counsel in
profiling various serial killers. The
series will focus on the relation-
ship between Lecter and Will Gra-
ham (Hugh Dancy, "The Big C"),
an FBI profiler.
At first blush, "Hannibal" ful-
fills expectations stunningly. The
visual world it creates is darkly riv-

"Autobiography of Red," is yet
another example of Carson's
supreme ability to incinerate
literary preconceptions and, out
of their ashes, produce a mas-

In Greek mythology, Herak-
les's 10th labor was to capture
the cattle of Geryon, a red-
winged giant. In "Autobiogra-

them as lovers - Geryon as a
timid, winged photographer
and Herakles as his older,
heartbreaking counterpart -
living in suburban America (or
perhaps, considering that Car-
son is from Toronto, suburban
Canada). "Recently I began to
wonder what happened to them
in later life," Carson writes in
the author's note on "Red Doc>"
's front sleeve. "To live past the
end of your myth is a perilous
thing."
"Red Doc>" begins with
Geryon - now much older and
going simply by the name G -
visiting his sick mother in the
hospital. Later, after being hit
over the head with a two-by-

White, Leeves talk
'Hot in Cleveland'

TV Land stars tease
'Mary Tyler Moore
Show' reunion
By ALEC STERN
Daily Arts Writer
When "Hot in Cleveland"
returns this summer for the sec-
ond half of season four, you can
expect more laughs, heart and a
few exciting surprises along the
way.
In a conference call with The
Michigan Daily, stars Betty
White ("The Golden Girls") and
Jane Leeves ("Frasier") dis-
cussed the upcoming episodes,
feminism and teased a "Mary
Tyler Moore Show" reunion.
When "Hot in Cleveland"
premiered in 2010, it became
TV Land's first original scripted
series. Just three years later, TV
Land is home to four original.
series, boasting such star power
as Fran Drescher, Kristen John-
ston and Cedric the Entertainer.
In development for the fall is
"Kirstie's New Show," a sitcom
starring Kirstie Alley and "Sein-
feld" star Michael Richards.
White and Leeves are aware
that their show has paved the
way for the latter series. Of their
status as pioneers of TV Land
original comedy, Leeves likened
"Hot in Cleveland" 's success to
that of another hit show.
"I think 'Hot in Cleveland'
has done for TV Land what 'Mad
Men' did for AMC," Leeves said.
"It sort of branded the network,
so it feels really great for us and
to keep this genre alive and kick-
ing, a genre that both Betty and
I have so much experience with
I think it's really wonderful."
One of the most anticipated
episodes of "Hot in Cleveland"
's upcoming season will feature
a "Mary Tyler Moore Show"
reunion of sorts - Moore, Val-
erie Harper and Cloris Leach-
man will join White and Georgia
Engel (who already recurs on
"Cleveland") for an episode set to
air in September.

Is this a Target commercial?
"The Mary Tyler Moore
Show," which ran from 1970 to
1977, was an important series in
the development of gender roles
on television, and White and
Leeves think "Hot in Cleveland"
has earned a place in that ongo-
ing discussion.
"(Our characters) are still try-
ing to continue and improve our-
selves ... The world doesn't lock
down when you pass a certain
age. It's always open for you, and
it's up to you to do it," White said.
"It's not over until it's over.
There's always room to reinvent
yourself as Elka (White's charac-
ter) is doing right now by going
back to college," Leeves said.

While "The Mary Tyler Moore
Show" reunion may not exactly
excite the average college stu-
dent, there is still plenty to enjoy
when "Hot in Cleveland" returns.
"I'm constantly surprised
by the young demographic we
have ... There is such a message
of hope in this show, and (it's) a
very modern twist on a classic
format," Leeves said.
Speaking more to the point,
she thinks college students
should tune in "because they
don't know what they're miss-
ing."
"Hot in Cleveland" returns on
Wednesday, June 19th at 10 p.m.
with a supersized live episode.

Six straight
for Michigan

Fifth-year senior offensive tackle Taylor Lewan spurned the NFL Draft to return to Michigan. Trey Burke, point guard for the basketball team, faces a similar decision.
Lewan can relate to Burke

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
Recently, the Wolverines have
been pumping out wins and
championships in all corners of
their athletic department - soft-
ball, swimming and diving, gym-
nastics and basketball, just to
name a few.
Tuesday night, the Michigan
baseball team kept pace. The
Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 17-14
overall)
battled MICHIGAN 4
No. 18 NOTRE DAME 1
Notre
Dame in South Bend and earned
a 4-1 victory, extending their
winning streak to six. Michigan
hasn't had this many victories in
succession since 2010.
"We're just trying to contrib-
ute in a positive way," said Michi-
gan coach Erik Bakich. "We're
just happy to be a part of the big-
ger picture because there's not a
better time to be associated with
Michigan athletics than right
now."
Sophomore right-hander
James Bourque earned the win
for Michigan, striking out four
in 5.1 innings. Fellow sophomore
right-hander Matt Ogden also
struck out four and picked up the
save, allowing only one hit in 3.2
frames.
"We were pitching to contact,"
Ogden said. "We had aggressive
hitters who swing right up to bat,
and we just let them get them-
selves out pretty much."
Increasingly, Bakich has been
able to rely on the pitching staff,
a change from years past.
"Our pitchers have alot of con-
fidence right now," Bakich said.
"They've really done a nice job
buying into pitching with quick
tempo and forcing contact. Let-
ting our defense work."
Pitching to contact wasn't
the only thing this team came
to South Bend prepared to do. A
number of well-timed hits also
gave Michigan the edge over
Notre Dame.
Michigan catcher Cole Mar-
tin got the offense running in
the third with a double, then

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
The conclusion of the basket-
ball season means the eyes of the
Michigan athletic community are
on sophomore point guard Trey
Burke and if he'll decide to leave
Michigan and enter the NBA
Draft.
Taylor Lewan knows that feel-
ing all too well - it's been three
months since
the Jan. 9 press NOTEBOOK
conference
when the fifth-year senior tackle
announced his decision to stay
with the Michigan football pro-
gram one more year instead of
entering the NFL Draft.
Lewan doesn't envy Burke's
decision at all, but now that all the
attention is off his status at Michi-
gan, he's focusing on things a little
bigger than him.
"I (stayed) for my team," Lewan
said. "Now that that's over, my
focus is Team 134 and it's not
about (how) I stayed. If I stayed
and we go 3-9 then that doesn't

matter. It's notabout me, it'll never
be about me."
Lewan's newest priority? Nur-
turing a youthful offensive line in
preparation for Saturday's spring
game and embracing his new lead-
ership role.
"I've tried to take it to a whole
new level," Lewan said. "My big
focus the last couple years has
been the offensive line, and I've
taken it to being the whole team
now. It's cool to see guys that are
starting to follow."
Lewan, though, has been reluc-
tant to praise the line too much
based off what he's seen this
spring. The unit is still struggling
with the minute details, such as
hand placement, and needs to
become more aware.
It appears redshirt freshman
guard Kyle Kalis has been mak-
ing enough progress this spring to
probably lock in the starting job,
and he has Lewan's full approval.
"It's cool to see the transi-
tion from just one season doing a
scout team to the spring and how
much more they've retained just

in those few months," Lewan said.
"If everybody focuses on their
assignment, does their job, that's
how you win games. Everything's
a one-on-one battle."
SPRING AWAKENING: Satur-
day's scrimmage in Michigan Sta-
dium signifies the end of spring
practice and the end of the Wol-
verines' first marking period, so to
speak.
The players spoke of some per-
sonal goals they hope to accom-
plish by Saturday. But some goals
are a little broader than others -
in addition to his own objectives
for the spring, part of senior cor-
nerback Courtney Avery's goals
includes mentoring the younger
defensive backs.
The Wolverines are blessed
with enough depth at secondary
to keep a healthy rotation dur-
ing practices, but with freshmen
constituting about a quarter of the
defensive backs, there's still a little
bit of a learning curve.
That's where Avery, and his fel-
low upperclassmen, come in.
"After you take your reps and

you're on the sideline, you watch
your position," Avery said. "That
way you can get your mental rest,
and you can help coach them. The
coaches on the field aren'tgoing to
be able to catch every little thing."
COUNTING ON CLARK: It
might only be spring ball, but
Lewan is already anticipating
postseason accolades for his team-
mates. On Tuesday, he expressed
little doubt that junior defensive
end Frank Clark will make the
All-Big Ten team, and that's based
only on the times he's gone up
against Clark in the limited num-
ber of spring practices.
Senior defensive tackle Jibreel
Black agreed and admitted he's
happy to have Clark on his side of

Projects will expand
capacity to utilize
uranium, expanding
Iranian capabilities
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -
With words of defiance, Iran
announced two nuclear-related
projects Tuesday that expand
capabilities to extract and pro-
cess uranium - modest advanc-
es in Tehran's atomic efforts but
ones symbolic of its refusal to
slow nuclear work even as talks
with world powers over the dis-
puted program remain dead-
locked.
The twin sites reflect Tehran's
goal of greater self-sufficiency
through the entire nuclear fuel
cycle from uranium mines to
enrichment labs.
Yet the timing - just days
after the latest round of negotia-
tions ended again in stalemate -
reinforces a broader suggestion
that Iran plans to push ahead
with nuclear projects even at
the potential risk of threatening
the dialogue with U.S. and other
envoys.
It also could amplify ques-
tions about Iran's commitment
to the talks - which have, for
the moment, hushed earlier talk
amongitsadversaries about mil-
itary options - and embolden
calls by some U.S. lawmakers for
even tougher sanctions.
Iran's gambit appears built
around its drive for formal
acknowledgment from Wash-
ington and other capitals of its
"right" to enrich uranium, the
process to make nuclear fuel.
Iran, in tandem, wants the West
to pull back on sanctions in
exchange for some nuclear com-
promises.

The West and its allies,
however, seek to rein in Iran's
nuclear efforts and fear that the
enrichment program could one
day produce material for atomic
weapons.
Iran says it only seeks nuclear
reactors for energy and medical
use. But the tone from Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadine-
jad was taunting on Tuesday to
mark the anniversary of Iran's
first uranium enrichment in
2006.
"You could not block our
access to nuclear technology
when we didn't have it. How
can you take it from our hands
now that we have it?" he said,
addressing the West.
"Iran has gone nuclear," he
added, reiterating past declara-
tions that Iran has comprehen-
sive nuclear expertise. "Nobody
will be able to stop it ... Coopera-
tion with the Iranian nation is
the best solution for you."
In Jerusalem, U.S. Secretary
of State John Kerry repeated that
Washington remained "open to
negotiation" within limits. He
later called the expanded ura-
nium work "not constructive."
"But it is not open-ended,
endless negotiation," he said fol-
lowing talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
whose nation has warned it
could consider military strikes
against Iranian nuclear sites. "It
cannot be used as an excuse for
other effort to try to break out
with respect to a nuclear weap-
on."
Kerry added: "President
(Barack) Obama could not be
more clear: Iran cannot have and
will not have a nuclear weapon."
Mounting nuclear threats
from North Korea, meanwhile,
have only added to internation-
al worries about allowing the

Iranian dialogue to drift indefi-
nitely.
"I think everybody under-
stands that Iran is running out
the clock, has been using the
talks to continue to advance its
nuclear programs," Netanyahu
said, citing the reports of two
new uranium sites in Iran.
Neither represents breakout
technology. Iran already has
uranium mines and the ability
to turn the raw ore into a mate-
rial called yellowcake, which is
the first step in the enrichment
chain.
But the new facilities -
expansion in the country's larg-
esturaniummineandprocessing
facility - give Tehran greater
access and control in making the
raw materials for enrichment to
nuclear fuel and, potentially, for
warhead-grade material.
State TV Â°'simultaneously
showed ceremonies at Iran's big-
gest uranium mine at Saghand
and a uranium ore concentrate
production plant in Ardakan,
both in central Iran.
Saghand consists of an open
pit with a deep mine reached
by two shafts of more than 335
meters (1,100 feet), according to
the official IRNA news agency.
The mine has a reported capac-
ity of 132,000 tons of uranium
ore per year.
TheArdakanYellowcake Pro-
duction Plant is Iran's industri-
al-scale facility that turns ore
into concentrate, also known as
yellowcake, the feedstock for
enrichment. IRNA said the plant
is capable of producing 66 tons
of yellowcake. About 200 tons
is needed to produce enough
nuclear fuel to run an energy-
producing reactor - similar to
Iran's lone reactor in the Persian
Gulf port of Bushehr - for a year,
nuclear experts say.

the science of it all: the nose knows by jenniferxu

Wednesday, April 10, 207// The StatementB
"What would you tell someone starting their time
at the University to do that you didn't do?"
with University Provost Phil Hanlon
and CSG President Manish Parikh

I once had an MCAT te

part of a year with an
effectively plugged-up
nose, eating all kinds of
foods indiscriminately
with little enjoyment.
Though he was never
officially diagnosed, my
teacher might have been
suffering from some-
thing called olfactory
fatigue. Characterized
by an inability to dis-
tinguish odors from one
another after prolonged
exposure to a particu-
larly strong-smelling
agent, olfactory fatigue
generally arises in indi-
viduals who spend large
amounts of time around
alcohol or spicy foods. Olfa
fatigue is categorized as a t
sensory adaptation, in whic

jars of ingredients such as vanilla,
cloves, celery and pencil shavings
around the house and smelling
the collection for about half an
hour a day. But there's a special
technique you have to procure in
order to become a true olfactory
connoisseur. Rather than take
one deep sniff, Winnegrad rec-
ommends that smellers take two
or three short whiffs and then

ale in order to prevent olfac-
'fatigue from kicking in.
f you're already a victim to
ctory fatigue, researchers at
University of Oklahoma rec-
mend that one should smell
ee beans in order to re-jolt
their sense of smell back
into shape. The study
hypothesizes that this is
because one of the 28 odor-'
ants contained in a cof-
fee molecule can detach
the original food odorants
responsible for olfactory
fatigue from their recep-
tors. In a sense, the coffee
scent will "refresh" the
receptors in an individual's
nose to make way for new
scent stimulants.
That's the reason why
perfume counters usually
have a jar of coffee beans
next to the scent samples
- the coffee beans allow
tomers to better distinguish
ween scents by competitively

and kicking out the original
fume odorants.
dy MCAT teacher eventually
ained his sense of smell, but

blem could've been as simple
rdering an espresso shot from

University Provost Phil Hanlon
- who has been a University
faculty member since 1986 - and
Manish Parikh, Business senior
and current Central Student
Government president, met in the
Daily's newsroom to look back
on their time at the University.
Parikh graduates in the spring,
and Hanlon will leave to serve as
president ofDartmouth College.
Hanlon and Parikh discussed the
following question: What would
you tell someone starting their
time at the University to do that
you didn't do?
Phil Hanlon: It took me too long
to discover the University. I spentr
too many years deep in the math
department just doing stuff with
the math faculty, math students,
math seminars and I didn't come
to appreciate what a fantastic
University this is and how many
cool things there are all around
the University ... I think what I
would tell someone is get out of
your department. Go explore the
University, go to the Clements
(Library), look at what's there -
they have amazing stuff at the
Clements - they have stuff like the
letter that launched the American
Revolution. Did you know that was
there? The letter from General
Gage to his troops in Boston telling
them to march on Lexington
and Concord, that letter's in the
Clements.
Manish Parikh: Wow. I have
to agree with the provost on this
one. One thing that I would tell
incoming students is, "You know
the burning questions that you
have, Google them." There're so
many times that I have asked my
roommates and friends at college
silly questions which I could
probably find the answer out to
in a few seconds online. There
are buildings on campus that
I've always admired but never
found the time to peek inside.
The Complex Systems Building,
which kind of overlooks the arch
a little beyond the Diag, is an
example of gone of the beautiful.

buildings on campus.
PH: So what about for students
when they come in. What do you
think is the thing that they fail to
do the most often?
MP: Well this may be contrary
to academics, but I would say
that while your GPA. and your
professional goals and your resume
are important, the things that
I've found most meaningful at.
Michigan and at life are being kind
and being happy, making good
friends and being compassionate.
Academics and 4.0 are important,
but so is being kind and happy and
compassionate.
PH: Yeah, one thing that I
think is the biggest change in the
students I've taught since I've been
here is (the) incredible interest in
students today to impact the world
in a positive way. It's different. It's
certainly different from when I
was a student. We weren't thinking
about that so much. We were
looking to the college and our
studies. Boy, today I just so admire
students. .., they're, out. working

in Detroit, they're out running I'm more wide
around the globe, they're starting near graduating
companies, they're doing all sorts
of stuff that's trying to better the MP: Mhmm..
world and I think that's a huge

-awake. So you're
right?

PH: Well I think, one thing you
have to say that jumps right out at
you is that the last decade has been
a decade where the University
has seen its most severe financial
challenges since the Great
Depression, and I think the thing
that I really am proud of - and it's
certainly not just me, but the whole
institution - is that we've actually
grown stronger during this period
I think we're at a better place than
we were 10 years ago. We were one
of the very few universities in the
country that didn't have severe
disruption in 2009, and I think I
can credit the careful planning
we did but also the hard work
everyone did on campus to execute
the plan. I think that's one of the
things I'm very pleased about. I
do think that we're very strong
academically right now. We're on
an upward trajectory. I have r
hesitation in sayingwe are the best
public university in the country
right now, and I'm very excited
about the future here.
MP: And speaking about finance
and money, a small piece of advice
that- I would give to incoming
students here is that it's very easy
to lose track of how much money
(you) have in your bank, and it's
very easy to spend a lot of money
at Zingerman's. Another piece n
advice I'd give is keep a noteboolk
and be acutely reminded of
finances and that kind of thing.
PH: I can understand that. I
think one of the worst moments
of my life was when I was a
student and I was hitchhiking
in New Zealand and I ran out of
money. I just literally ran out of
money and back then there was
no way to get hold of my parents
or something like that. There was
just no way to communicate. So I
was in Wellington and I had to get
to Auckland the next day to catch
the plane, and so I threw myself at
the mercy of the bus company and
they let me ride in the freight bus
to go overnight in the back with,
the boxes. But I got there. Very
entreprenepgial, ,

change for the good. L
MP: Another small piece of
advice - provost, I think at the
faculty level it's far different too
because you're used to waking
up on time - but something I
struggled with as a freshman was
finding a good alarm clock. It really
did take a while. Waking up on
time and attending class on time is
really important, and I think half
the challenge at Michigan is just
showing up.
PH: Yeah, I've always taught
early in the morning -8:30 classes,
8:30 calculus class, office hours at
8:00. Students get there, they're
kind of awake.
MP: Have you ever struggled to
wake up for classes back when you
were a student?
PH: Oh yeah, I do remember
that I was sleepier back then. Now

PH: So what do you think is the
most important thing you're taking
away from Michigan?
MP: I think for me as a junior,
I felt really frustrated with myself
that I wasn't doing anything
much or accomplishing anything
at Michigan and that I would
graduate in ayear and I would have
made a few good friends, taken a
few good classes, but that couldn't
have been what this Michigan
experience was all about. I've
really enjoyed this role in CSG
making a small difference, leaving
a small mark. I think that's pretty
exciting for me.
MP: In your time here at
Michigan, what would say are
yours and President Coleman's
biggest accomplishments? How
has Michigan really evolved over
the last five, six, ten years?

why. But then he finds a reason.
"I think before the game starts, they expect
werything to be perfect. And then I think
they expect it to get better as the game goes
along ... I think this is what frustrates them:
we don't care who wins."
1989: Hillary's first chance to experience
the thrill of officiating on the Final Four stage.
As he took to the court in Seattle for the tipoff
between the University of Michigan and Illi-
nois, he wasn't nervous for his home-state
team - a team he said he never liked, even
though he resides in Grand Rapids, adding
that he didn't like any Division I teams. He
was nervous for himself.
"There were 40,000 people in the dome,
and I was standing there and my legs were
shaking so badly, I couldn't stop them from
shaking," Hillary said.
Based on the banners hanging in Crisler
Center, it was Michigan's last Final Four visit
before this year. Michigan reached the stage
ix 1992 and 1993, but the University vacated
the wins after the Fab Five controversy. It was
that Final Four game in 1989 that led Michi-
gan to the National Championship, and their
first and only NCAA title win.
But to Hillary, it was his first of three Final
Four visits.
"I never worked a National Championship
game, but if you were an official, that is your
goal: to go to the Final Four."
In our conversation, he didn't mention
Michigan's win or their progression to the
National Championship, where they beat
ton Hall. I searched for YouTube clips
from the game, hoping to see Hillary on the
sidelines. But the highlights didn't include
any close-ups of Hillary's shaking legs. I saw
then-forward Glen Rice and the short shorts
Michigan wore in the pre-Fab Five days. I
thought I spotted a younger version of today's
gray-haired, slightly balding Hillary standing
under the hoop when Michigan took the lead
with three minutes left in the game. The game
was tied at 81, with 28 seconds left. Michi-
gan had the ball. Rumeal Robinson missed
the 3-pointer, but Sean Higgins found the
ebound and layup, solidifying the 83-81 win
or Michigan and creating a memory for all
Michigan fans. Even then, we were on.
But Hillary's tone conveyed no devotion to
Michigan. I asked if he felt hesitant officiating
that game, since he resides in the state.

"I never had a team that I liked, and I think
it's because I went to a Division II school.
When I got to work with Division I schools, I
just never cared who won the game. But you
have to live someplace."
Hillary worked as a high-school teacher as
well as an official for the first 26 years of his
referee career. Initially, he wanted to work
as a basketball coach ifa job opened up, but a
friend encouraged him to become an official.
"What possessed me to forget about coach-
ing and going into refereeing, I would say, was
the excitement of the game," Hillary said. "I
didn't have to take any losses either, that was
kind of nice."
Orchestrating the officials in the NCAA
Tournament is John Adams, the NCAA
national coordinator of men's basketball offi-
ciating and the voice of the officials during the
tournament. "Fairness" is what he defends
when speaking on behalf of the hand-select-
ed officials working the NCAA Tournament,
officials he deems as the 100 best referees in
Division I.
As he drove across Ohio through an area
he deemed "sparsely settled," Adams called
me on speakerphone with a NCAA spokesper-
son silent in the background, listening in from
Indianapolis. Selection Sunday was only two
days away.
One-hundred officials are selected to work
March Madness from a list of recommenda-
tions given by each conference and Adams's
team. On March 17, Selection Sunday this
year, 68 college teams solidified their spot in
the NCAA Tournament and so did 100 offi-
cials.
You could make a bracket just for the offi-
cials. The NCAA evaluates the officials during
the tournament. If they perform well, they
move on to the next round. This means the
nine officials who work the Final Four games
and the National Championship are the best
of the best - an honorable spot Division I offi-
cials dream of holding, but also acknowledged
as a risk to their careers.
"You're on the only game being played that
night, and now you're on a call that deter-
mines the game, and you're at risk of everyone
watching that play and.seeingyou make a mis-
take," Adams said.
And when that call happens, Adams often

has to discuss it, recognizing if the officials
were right or wrong after the game concludes.
"I think the officiating is fairly similar as
it was 10 years ago, but the media scrutiny is
incredibly heightened over just the shortest
time of five years ago," Adams said.
Today's advanced production of sporting
events creates YouTube clips as evidence for
fans arguing a call. With often seven to eight
camera angles at one NCAA Tournament
game - and the ability for commentators
to zoom and slow down the action to sloth
speeds - the eyes of the officials aren't the
only eyes focused on examining the court.
"None of our officials are refereeing the
games on the television in slow motion. They
are doing it in the arena in real time, and that
is really, really hard," Adams said.
Take the National Championship matchup
between Michigan and Louisville. A foul was
called on sophomore guard Trey Burke with
5:10 left in the game. But was it a foul, or a
clean block? Officials said foul, giving Louis-
ville's Peyton Siva free throws to stretch the
lead to five. But according to Rodger Sherman
with SB Nation, it was a block, prompting his
article, "Final Four 2013: Did bad referee-
ing give Louisville its title?" And other news
outlets have joined suit, NBC News declaring
"Poor officiating puts a black eye on a thrill-
ing, memorable Final Four." And it's prompted
many students to make the still image from
the game --what they consider Burke careful-
ly blocking and not fouling Siva at the hoop -
their cover photo on Facebook in protest. Did
that one call change the game? Adams has yet
to comment publicly on the incident.
Adams said looking past the scrutiny, the
instant reaction to calls made by officials does
make the job rewarding.
"Most officials tell you, when they're fin-
ished, they miss the games. It's reallythrilling
to be out there refereeing a basketball game
in front of a big crowd and ... it's instant rein-
forcement."
But 2,500 games later, Hillary sounds tired.
Tired of the travel during the season, which he
described as "brutal." During the regular sea-
son, he could be on the road for 15 to 16 days in
a row with only a one-day break in between
trips, all which required his own planning.
"You get up in the morning at 6 a.m., get

on a flight probably connecting someplace,
and you go to another town," Hillary said of
his work routine. "There's quite a bit of loneli-
ness out there, butyou call back home, and you
tell them everything's OK and talk with them.
That's one of the tough parts of the'game -
they couldn't pay you enough money for that
part."
Hillary also seems tired of the game of bas-
ketball itself, adding he will turn on games just
to see if he knows the referees. If he knows
them, he will only watch briefly.
"Certainly I'll watch some of the NCAA
Tournament, but to watch a whole game?
That would probably take a lot out of me. I
don't know if I'd do that."
In this year's tournament, it was Driscoll's
turn to try and reach the Final Four stage for
the fourth time. Driscoll made it to the Sweet
Sixteen, officiating the Michigan State versus
Duke game in Indianapolis. I watched the
game to see Driscoll.
As Driscoll races up and down the side-
lines, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski watches
closely. It's a bigger stage, but his unwavering
gait and quick pace mirrors his officiating in
the Big East Tournament. With the camera
held tightly to the Blue Devils and Spartans,
Driscoll is often lost in the frame of the shot,
disappearing as the teams move down the
court and reappearing at the bottom of the key
in quick time. He's never in focus.
In our interview, Iasked Driscoll if he filled
out a March Madness bracket, hoping to catch
him in a moment of fandom. His answer was
a quick "No."
"When you become an official, you need to
understand what you have signed up for and
what you're getting involved in, and with that
comes walking that fine line and making sure
you're fair, and balanced and consistent," he
said.
I asked if it was difficult to surrender his
fandom.
"It wasn't difficult because this is what I
chose to do."
Any devout Michigan basketball fan has
seen Driscoll six times this season. You've
probably yelled at him on your screen,
maybe including expletives. And you've
probably questioned his judgment, or given
him praise, for calling traveling on the oppo-
nent. But you've seen him, whether you rec-
ognize it or not.

ciating. I found Driscoll's contact information
through his professional job as a local opera-
tions director in Syracuse, N.Y. for Say Yes to
Education - a program that offers academic
assistance to Syracuse students in the city
where he resides. While many referees devote
themselves fulltime to officiating, others, like
Driscoll, view it asa part-time job.
"People are attorneys, they are police offi-
cers, firefighters - you name it. There is a wide
spectrum of professions that also officiate col-
lege and high-school basketball."
They're also fathers. Driscoll's three children
- including his 17-year-old son, who justbegan
officiating high-school games - and friends
will often watch a broadcasted game that he's
officiating, focusing on Driscoll instead of the
typical stars on the court.
I watched the last half of the Villanova ver-
sus St. John's game with this intent. As the lens
of the camera hugged tightly to the players, I
caught a glimpse of a striped black-and-white
shirt and a tall, dark-haired man at the bottom
of the key in Madison Square Garden. This was
Driscoll, and my first actual conscious sighting
of a man I'm sure I've seen on televisionbefore
- he's officiated six Michiganbasketballgames
this season. The score was 50-45, Villanova
leading, with 7:14left in the game.And the play-
ers of the two teams were fighting for points.
"The officials in the NFL would throw flags
on these plays," the announcers added after an
especially intense collision between players at
the St. John's hoop. But in the pressure of the
game, Driscoll kept his composure, possessing
the calm demeanor he described of his own

father. He weaved effortlessly across the court
to better view the action, always careful to stay
out of the plays but close enough to watch. It
almostseemed as if a force existedbetween the
players and the officials, each recognizing the
other's presence and circulating like planets in
orbit avoiding collision. The clash came when
Driscoll and his two fellow officials, poised
with whistles in their mouths ready to make a
call, did their job.
In Ted Hillary's 44 years as a referee, he
faced the challenge of players, coaches and fans
imparting their emotions, especially frustra-
tion, onto the officials after a call. His three
sons and wife, Kathy, used to attend the games
he officiated until it became too much.
"She had the children at the game, and they
were asking their mother, 'Why do these people
hate Dad?' She would come up with a million
excuses and then decided I'm not taking these
kids to anymore games," Hillary said.
Hillary refuses to attend basketball games
anymore due to the harsh vocal opinions of
many fans.
"It's real tough. I want to go up and slap
them. They are just sometimes so ignorant, and
then I think to myselfi No wonder these people
are yelling that out there, they don't know what
they're talking about."
But the question remains: why do fans act
this way towards officials? Hillary doesn't
know, and he mulls over this question more
than any other in our conversation. His tone
even suggests he hasn't given much thought to
