Economic downturn
may have offset any
benefits, owners say
ByAUSTINWORDELL
For the Daily
Though the East University Ave-
nue community has seen an uptick
in foot traffic since the construe-
tion of the Zaragon Place luxury
apartment complex, business own-
ers are saying that the increase
hasn't necessarily translated into
an increase in business.
In a series of interviews with
The Michigan Daily, local business
owners and managers reported it
has been business as usual, despite
Zaragon Place housing almost
three times as many residents,
as the Anberay Apartments, the
building that was demolished to
make room for the Zaragon com-
plex. And whether it's the result
of anupeasy economic climate - a
common belief among several store
managers - any positive effect of
the increase in students living in
the area is minimal at best, several
businesses said.
Nick Brudnak, manager of the

local popularItalian restaurant
Mia Za's, said his restaurant hasn't
seen any increase in overall busi-
ness since Zaragon Place went up,
adding that a poor economy might
be offsetting any benefits from the
apartment complex.
"We haven't seen any -measur-
able increase that I can say is due
to that building (Zaragon Place),"
Brudnak said. "That isn't to say the
economy hasn't balanced out what
is happeningnext door."
However, Brudnak said the
business has seen a small increase
its sales since the East Univer-
sity sidewalk reopened after the
demolition of Anberay and con-
struction of Zaragon Place. During
Zaragon's construction, the side-
walk was completely blocked off by
t5 feet on each side of the building,
and many stores on East University
did not get as much foot traffic.
Sabrina Hirachian, owner of
YCI Clothing, a high-end women's
clothing store located on South
University Avenue, said that while
she hasn't seen an increase in sales,
she finds the additional housing to
be a positive contribution to the
area.

826michigan is not your run-
of-the-mill youth tutoring ser-
vice. Upon entering the East
Liberty Street center, visitors are
met by a robot store that serves
as the space's storefront. There
are robot-themed stickers, color-
ing books, ski hats, building kits
and key chains. It is a robot lover's
heaven.

The magical world continues as
one walks through draping red-
velvet curtains into 826michi-
gan's headquarters. The room
is cozy and inviting with rect-
angular wooden tables, shelves
overflowing with books and long
mustard-colored velvet couches
that line the back wall.
The dual purpose of the space
as both a robot store and learning
center is part of 826michgian's
beauty, said Amanda Uhle, execu-

tive director of 826michigan's
Ann Arbor location. She said the
robot store helps to stir children's
imagination and encourages them
to understand that learning isn't
boring. Furthermore, the profits
from the store - in addition to
outside donations - help to main-
tain the cost-free services of the
non-profit organization.
826michigan works with chil-
dren ages 6 to 18 on a range of
subjects including homework

assistance, college applications,
creative writing skills and the
English language, Uhle said. And
students in a variety of programs
at the University volunteer their
services at the center every day.
Uhle explained that 826michi-
gan functions on the basis of three
core values: the importance of
writing, one-on-one attention and
free services.

GREEK LIFE
Officials: New sober liaison
collaboration successful so far

A FEATHER IN YOUR BRAID

System requires
sorority members to
share safety burden
at fraternity events
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
A new initiative to give soror-
ity members more responsibility
for party safety at Interfratnerity
Council-registered parties has
been successful so far, Greek Life
officials say.
The new collaboration between
IFC and the Panhellenic Associa-
tion requires that a certain num-
ber of women must remain sober

at a fraternity event, fulfilling a
role similar to sober monitors. The
initiative began with an amend-
ment passed last semester by IFC,
which requires a few members
from visiting chapters to serve as
social liaisons alongside the sober
monitors of the hosting fraternity
at IFC events. The number of des-
ignated social liaisons depends on
the size of the registered event.
The purpose of having the
female sober liaisons as opposed
to just male sober monitors is to
allow sorority women who may
need assistance at events to feel
more comfortable, according to
Greek student officials.
LSA senior Tarin Krzywo-
sinski, vice president of social
responsibility for Panhel, said

sorority member liaisons who
she has talked to find their par-
ticipation at events to be "benefi-
cial." She said there haven't been
any major problems with the col-
laboration reported so far.
"They've personally dealt with
girls that needed help," Krzy-
wosinski said. "Their presence
overall made the parties safer.
They're glad it's a requirement."
Krzywosinski said she hopes
this amendment will give the
Greek community a more posi-
tive image and show all members
of the University and the larger
Ann Arbor community that safe-
ty is one of the organizations' top
priorities.
"Hopefully this will be some-

Ragstock on East

By MELISSA MARCUS
Daily StaffReporter
With ugly sweater season fast
approaching, a new store is hop-
ing to become the go-to spot for
picking out the party favorite.

Ragstock, located on East Lib-
erty Street offers new and recy-
cled clothing, in addition to awide
array of Halloween costumes.
Store manager Emilie Parker said
they opened the store at the per-
fect moment last month - just in
time for Halloween costume sea-
son.
"There was a really nice rush at
the beginning for people buying
Halloween costumes and items,"
Parker said.

Business slowed down a bit
after Halloween, Parker said,
but now the store is working on
switching over to clothing that
caters to the holiday season like
holiday party sweaters.
In addition to seasonal cloth-
ing and accessories, Ragstock
also carries b-nsic clothing items
in a variety of colors and styles, as
well as vintage clothing.

Residents, franchise
owner say they
expect spot will be a
successful location
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
For the Daily
Residents of the apartment
building 4 Eleven Lofts, located at
the corner of East Washington and
Division Streets, say they are anx-
iously awaiting the arrival of a Sub-
way restaurant, which is coming to

the firast floor of the high-rise.
Randy Munroe, owner of the,
new Subwaybranch, said he signed
a lease for a space on the ground
floor of 4 Eleven Lofts a few weeks
ago. He said he hopes this Subway
branch willbecome one of the most
profitable locations in the region.
Munroe said he expects the final-
stages of the project will go smooth-
ly and anticipates a successful open-
ing. The franchise was initially
scheduled to open in January 2011,
but due to many variables like hir-
ing, Munroe said a definite opening
date hasn'tbeen determined yet.
Munroe co-owns several Sub-

way restaurants in the area with his
wife, Denise. The couple first got
involvedwithSubwayin1994. Since
then, the pair has owned seven
Subway restaurants in the metro
Detroit area, but sold their busi-
nesses when Munroe's job in the
railroad business transferred him
to Illinois.
After a two-year hiatus from the
Subway business, Munroe said he is
looking forward to the opening of
this Ann Arbor location.
"We love the area, the whole
atmosphere; everything about Ann
Arbor, we really like," he said.

Democrats divided on Pelosi's House leadership bid

Illinois Democratic
representative:
Nancy Pelosi is
politically toxic'
WASHINGTON (AP) - In
a fresh sign of turmoil among
defeated Democrats, a growing
number of the rank and file say
they won't support House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi in a politically sym-
bolic roll call when the new Con-
gress meets in January.
"The reality is that she is politi-
cally toxic," said Illinois Rep.
Mike Quigley, one of several Dem-
ocrats who are trying to pressure
Pelosi to step aside as her party's
leader in the wake of historic
election losses to Republicans last
week.
Pelosi startled many Demo-
crats with a quick postelection
announcement that she would run
for minority leader. She has yet to
draw an opponent for the post.
Party elections are scheduled
for next week, although a post-
ponement is possible.
In the interim, Pelosi's crit-
ics have become more vocal in
their efforts to retire her from the
party leadership.
There's "starting to be a sense
that this may not be as much of

a done deal as people might have
thought," Rep. Jason Altmire said
of Pelosi's quest to remain the top
Democrat.
"If enough people come out and
voice a little discomfort with the
idea of her continuing on, maybe
she would reconsider," said the
Pennsylvanian, one of a handful
of Democrats who said he won't
cast a ceremonial vote for her.
The election of a party leader
occurs behind closed doors. A
separate election for speaker tobe
held on Jan. 5, a few hours after
the House convenes for the first
time, is a very visible one. One
member of each party is typically
nominated, and each lawmaker is
then called by name to stand and
declare a choice. The event is cus-
tomarily televised live.
Defections from party disci-
pline are rare in such circum-
stances, but several Democrats
said they would not support Pelo-
si. They did not specify how they
would vote instead.
Despite the criticism, one
prominent ally, Rep. George Mill-
er of California, said Wednesday
night that Pelosi enjoys the sup-
port of the "overwhelming num-
ber of members of the caucus" for
a new term as party leader.
"There has always been in the
caucus and there always will be
in the caucus people who want

to distance themselves from the
leadership. That's not new.t think
that's a very small percentage,"
Miller said.
Pelosi's spokesman, Brendan
Daly, added that the speaker has
strong support throughout the
caucus and "is grateful for the
confidence that her colleagues
have placed in her to become
House Democratic leader."
Most of the Democrats who
say they would not support Pelosi
are moderates from conservative
districts who have toiled to dis-
tinguish themselves from their
liberal leader, and who watched
dozens of like-minded Democrats
go down in defeat after Republi-
cans savaged them in TV adver-
tisements as lapdogs of the San
Francisco congresswoman.
Quigley stopped short of saying
he would oppose Pelosi on a pub-
lic vote, but others did not.
"You would find an unusual
number of people not voting for
the nominee of their party" if
Pelosi were the choice, said Rep.
Jim Matheson of Utah.
"There's a growing number
of people in the caucus saying,
'Why's she running for minority
leader in the first place?' We just
got thumped in this election in a
major way, and to act like we can
just go back and do the same thing
over again. Itjustseems like avery

-ouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California takes the stage to speak to supporters at an election night party in Washington.

P



obvious situation when change is
called for," Matheson said.
Rep. Dan Boren, D-Okla.,
another conservative, said
through a spokesman that he,
too, plans to vote against Pelosi in
public and private.
Rep. Mike Ross, D-Ark., strong-
ly suggested as much in a state-
ment in which he said he wouldn't
back Pelosi "for House Democrat-
ic leader or any other leadership
position in the Congress."
Democrats lost at least 60 seats
in last week's elections, with a

handful of races yet to be settled.
Many of the defeats came in con-
servative or swing districts, and
many of her critics are lawmakers
who survived narrowly.
Altmire won re-election by lit-
tle more than 2 percentage points,
but Quigley ran up more than 70
percent of the vote in his Chica-
go-area district. Pelosi has "prob-
ably been made the scapegoat in
all this," he said in an interview,
but he added that keeping her as
the top Democrat "would make
recruitment very difficult and

winning back the House in two
years nearly impossible."
The prospect of substantial
Democratic defections from Pelo-
si on the first day of the new Con-
gress comes amid a heated debate
between liberals and conserva-
tives about the party's future.
Many liberals assert Democrats
must reinvigorate core supporters
by refusing to compromise with
Republicans on key principles,
while centrists argue they must
tack to the middle to win over
independent voters.




SUBWAY
From Page 1
Munroe said that because Ann
Arbor has been impacted less by
Michigan's current economic hard-
ships than other areas where he has
previously owned franchises, he is
hopeful that the restaurant will be
successful.
Subway development agent Kip
Klopfenstein also said that the
college-town atmosphere was part
of what drew his attention to Ann
Arbor. The company conducted
research on other Subway fran-
chises that are located near college
campuses, before selecting4 Eleven
Lofts as the next site, he said.
Munroe said "there should be no
competition whatsoever" between
the new restaurant location and the
Subway that is currently located in
the Michigan Union. He explained
that the Subway team runs a market
analysis prior to granting a franchi-

see the ability to open a branch, and
it came to the conclusion that there
won't be a conflict with existing
locations.
LSA junior Paige Kolesar, a cur-
rent 4 Eleven Lofts resident, said
she is looking forward to the res-
taurant's opening. Residents of the
apartment building have long been
frustrated with the lack of eateries
nearby, she said.
"It's exciting that they've finally
made a decision aboutit, andI think
it's going to do very well," she said.
LSA sophomore Ryan Klopcic,
who also lives in 4 Eleven Lofts,
said he was attracted to living in 4
Eleven Lofts this year after he was
told Subway would be coming to
the building. He said he thinks the
new Subway will be popular among
students who live in the area, since
residents currently have to walk
three blocks east to State Street in
order to dine out.
"I think it'll do really well, espe-
cially in the winter," he said.

G Cox against
hippewa land deal
Michigan's attorney general is
jecting to a settlement reached
ter five years of litigation that
ould grant the Saginaw Chippewa
ibe some authority over land that
claimed was part of the original
servation.
The deal signed this week would
ut all or part of seven townships
mid-Michigan's Isabella County
nder partial control of the tribe,
hich is known for its Soaring
agle casino in Mount Pleasant.
here are agreements on taxes,
olice jurisdiction and zoning,
mong other issues, affecting tribal
embers who live there.
In a court filing, Attorney Gen-
ral Mike Cox said the settlement
epresents a significant change in
e relationship between the state
nd the tribe, and the public needs
ore time to digest the deal.
Cox, a Republican, said he was
specially concerned about a pro-
ibition on non-tribal police going
nto tribal territory unless they
ere in hot pursuit or responding
o an emergency.
ASHINGTON
Study finds 'don't
ask, don't tell' can
be easily repealed
Gay rights advocates said yes-
terday they hoped Congress will be
moved to repeal the law known as
'don't ask, don't tell" after a Pen-
tagon study found it could be done
with little harm to the military.
The Senate is expected to vote
next month on ending the 17-year-
old legislation barring gays from
serving openly in the armed forces.
Several senators, including Olym-
pia Snowe, R-Maine, and Jim Webb,
D-Va., have said they wanted to see
the study's findings before deciding
how to vote.
"These results confirm what
those of us who actually know the
modern military, especially the
rank-and-file troops, have said
all along: The men and women of
America's armed forces are profes-
sionals who are capable of handling
this policy change," said Alexander
Nicholson, . executive director of
Servicemembers United.
Repeal opponents shot back, say-
ing the group leading the study,
which has not been released pub-
licly, was biased and that selected
details were leaked to the media
this week in an effort to drum up
public support for repeal.
HAVERFORD, Pa.
Teen forced to leave
horse at home
Whoa! There will be no more
horsing around for a suburban Phil-
adelphia teen who's been commut-
ing to school on his trusty steed.
Roby Burch had been riding his
horse Jet about four miles each way
to the private Haverford School. He
was keeping the horse in a corral on
school grounds.
Burch told The Philadelphia

Inquirer that school trustees decid-
ed in October that the horse was a
liability. The teen then began keep-
ing Jet at his uncle's house nearby.
However, Burch said Jet hurt his
hoof from the repeated trips over
pavement. Another family horse
twice escaped while Burch was in
class.
Now he's getting a ride from his
parents. The 16-year-old hopes to
get his driver's license in February.
JERUSALEM
Former Israeli
Prime Minister to
leave hospital
Former Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, comatose for more
than four years after suffering a
series of strokes, is going home'to
his ranch, an aide said yesterday.
One of Israel's most popular
and controversial figures, Sharon
has been in the long-term care
unit of Tel Hashomer Hospital
outside Tel Aviv since suffering
the strokes in 2006.
Rasnan Gissin, a longtime
Sharon aide, told The Associat-
ed Press that "the plan is by the
end of the week for him to return
home." Sharon has a sheep ranch
in Israel's south.
Dr. Zeev Rothstein, director
of the hospital where Sharon has
been a patient, described his con-
* dition as "mini-unconsciousness,
meaning he is not unconscious
but he is not fully conscious.

cause for any increase in busi-
ness, but I think that it is good
for business," Hirachian said. "I
think it makes the street very
attractive."
Hirachian added that the
economy is still a little slow to
bounce back and it might be
canceling out any benefits of the
nearby Zaragon residents.
"It's still too soon to know,"
she said.
One reason local businesses
may not be seeing an uptick in
business, despite a swell of stu-
dents living in the area, may be
because Zaragon Place came
with two attached businesses.
Revive and Replenish, located
on the main floor of the apart-
ments, were part of the approv-
al process for Zaragon Place.
Revive is a coffee shop and deli
that prepares its own food, while
Replenish sells beer, wine, chees-
es and some essential groceries.
Dick Schubach, one of the
owners of both Revive and
Replenish, estimated that during
the school year, 80 percent of his
customers are students and that a
significant number of those stu-

including budget cuts to pub-
lic schools across the country,
classroom overcrowding and an
increase in parents' work time,
Uhle said that one-on-one inter-
action between children and their
teachers or parents is less fre-
quent. She added that 826michi-
gan is able to help address this
problem by providing children
with one-on-one tutors.
"We have somehow found a
way to make (826michigan) invit-
ing and fun, and the best way you
can describe it is to look around at
the children who are happy to be
here and so relaxed," she said.
826michigan opened in Ann
Arbor in 2005 as an indepen-
dent organization affiliated with
826national, Uhe said. The
national branch was founded in
San Francisco by author Dave
Eggers, and has since spread to
eight locations across the coun-
try. Each location has a different
store theme, like a pirate store in
San Francisco and a superhero
store in New York.
The Ann Arbor organization
collaborates - with local public
schools, specifically those in
Ypsilanti, and with places like the
Ozone House and Avalon Hous-
ing - housing organizations that
support low-income families in
the area - in the hopes of com-
bining learning and fun, Uhle
said.
"We serve in a year about 2,000
students and some of those are (at
826michigan) and some of those
are out in school classrooms and
other places," she said.
According to Uhe, one of their
most successful programs is a
second-grade class field trip, in
which students come to 826mich-

igan and write and create their
ownbound books.
"In two hours a second-grader
walks in with nothing and walks
out with a book that they wrote,"
she said.
Volunteers and students using
the tutoring services can come
by on a drop-in basis whenever
they're available, Uhle said.
"It's a really appealing volun-
teer opportunity for people," she
said, "because they don't have to

and it's great for us."
Joe Schlenke, a longtime
employee of Espresso Royale
on South University, said he
believes the stores that opened
with Zaragon Place have added
competition to coffee shops in
the area.
"I have seen the diversity of
our clientele increase a little bit, I
haven't noticed any sales boost,"
Schlenke said. "I think there is a
little more competition."
But Zaragon residents say they
are taking advantage of Zaragon
Place's central location and fre-
quenting shops in the area.
LSA sophomore Udae Sandhu,
a Zaragon Place resident, said
he believes tenants of the apart-
ment complex are likely to be
more affluent than other stu-
dents, which is probably good for
area businesses.
"A lot of kids here are willing
to spend a lot more money than
the average student," Sandhu
said.
Business sophomore Costa
Mavroleon, another Zaragon
resident, said he finds the fact
that the building is surround-
ed by a variety of restaurants
encourages him to eat out more
often and spend money at area
establishments.
"You are much more encour-
aged to go out and eat just
because of the location," Mavro-
leon said.
commit necessarily to a sched-
ule."
826michigan works closely
with the University's Master of
Fine Arts in Creative Writing
Program, and many MFA stu-
dents are tutors at the center.
,Catherine Calabro, the pro-
gram coordinator of 826michi-
gan, first got involved with the
organization while she was a
graduate student in the creative
writing program. She said she
loves the organization's innova-
tive spin on learning.
"It's really exciting to see
adults and students use their
creativity to come up with some-
thing together," Calabro said.
In addition to students in the
writing program, Uhe said vol-
unteers of all ages and disciplines
are needed and welcome.
LSA senior Erin Bernhard, an
826michigan volunteer, said she
feels that she is making a differ-
ence by helping a young girl from
Korea complete her homework
and learn English.
"I absolutely love it," Bernhard
said. "I love being able to make
her laugh and smile."
Education junior Katy Wagner,
who also tutors at 826michigan,
said the organization is an ami-
able and worry-free environment
for kids and teenagers.
"(26michigan) makes things
really fun and relaxed, and so I
think that kids don't feel pres-
sured to have the right answer all
the time," Wagner said.
In addition to the tutoring ser-
vice, the organization also hosts
a variety of writing workshops
like poetry writing, prose writ-
ing, fairy tale writing and super-
hero writing. Students' work is
then published online and in the
several books and catalogs that
826michigan distributes.
Julie Rick, a master's student
in the School of Information,
interned at 826michigan this

past summer and now works
there a few days a week. She
said it is really the people behind
826michigan that make the cen-
ter's services possible.
"I think that the people who
are here want to be here and
have a deep love of kids and
learning and want to share that
to help create life-long learners,"
she said.

RAGSTOCK
From Page 1
Ragstock is based in Minneapolis
with 15 locations throughout the
Midwest. The concept for the store,
Parker said, began in the 1960s as
rag-picking companies became
popular. College students would
ask if they could look through the
clothing at factories before the
items were turned into rags. Gradu-
ally, this method evolved into the
idea behind used-clothing stores
like Ragstock.
Ragstock gets all its used cloth-
ing from a warehouse that buys
the articles by the bale and sorts
through it to distribute it to all the
store branches, according to Parker.
As for the new clothing, the com-
pany has buyers who go out to New
York City and order various items,
she said.
The store also gets overstock or
irregulars of name-brand products
so it can keep prices low, Parker
said. These cheap prices help to
attract college customers, which is
why every Ragstock store is located
in a college town. But, the clothing

thing that just becomes common
practice for years to come," she
said. "No one will even know that
this was something that we didn't
do in the past."
Members of both councils were
initially concerned that some
sororities might not participate
in the policy because some soror-
ity national organizations did not
want their members taking on
increased responsibility and liabil-
ity at parties. But LSA senior Mike
Miniaci, vice president of social
responsibly for IFC, wrote in an
e-mail interview that so far the
amendment is going better than
originally anticipated.
"I expected some hiccups as
we were first implementing the
policy," Miniaci wrote. "But every-
thing has gone smoothly. Fra-
ternities and sororities are both
cooperating, and the results are
showing with the increased safety
at our events."
The social liaisons have been
very helpful to-the fraternity sober
monitors, according to Miniaci.
"With the social liaisons looking
after the members of their sorority,

is meant to appeal to a variety of
ages, Parker said.
LSA senior Jessica Jurek said
she's found Ragstock to be a
"trendy-meets-vintage" kind of
store.
"For me, it looked like a combina-
tion of Salvation Army with bright
Christmas sweaters and tie-dye
shirts," Jurek said.
But Jurek said she wonders if
on actively controlling the event,"
he wrote.
over the course of this and fol-
lowing semesters, Miniaci wrote
that both councils will have a
better sense of the amendment's
strengths and weaknesses.
"I anticipate IFC and Panhel to
evaluate the amendment and make
changes if they are necessary," he
wrote.
Engineering senior Lianna Gor-
don, executive vice president of
Panhel, said she thinks IFC events
have improved with the new initia-
tive.*
"It is safer," she said. "(The
social liasons) know their sisters
and they can identify them versus
a fraternity member who doesn't
necessarily know who they are,
where they're from, how old they
are, whether they live in a dorm or,
in the sorority house, etc."
General safety knowledge with-
in Panhel has also increased with
the addition of educational work-
shops on the effects of alcohol con-
sumption, Gordon said.
This semester, Gordon has
restarted the Secure in Sister-
hood workshops in partnership
with University Health Service.
The goal of these workshops is to
increase alcohol awareness, partic-
ularly among new freshman mem-

many students will find out about
the store because of its location,
which is a few blocks away from
Central Campus.
"I feel like people might not walk
by there as much, though, because
it is not in the best location," Jurek
said. "Although, they had unique
things, and it would be worthwhile
to walk the extra five minutes to get
an outfit for themed parties."
bers, for whom the workshops are
mandatory.
"We were trying to reach out
to them and say, 'Listen; you are
going out at night, what's the story
you want to tell in years to come?
... What stories do you portray?'"
Gordon said.
For example, the workshops
addressed the implications of hav-
ing party pictures on Facebook,
and how various medications like
birth control, ADD and ADHD
medicine can affect how intoxicat-
ed one feels, she said. Other topics
included the effects of Four Loko,
the recently banned alcoholic ener-
gy drink.
The point of the workshops,
Gordon said, isn't to preach to
membersthat they shouldn'tdrink,
but rather to encourage them to be
safe.
"The purpose is to help girls
understand when they need to help
their sisters, how to help them-
selves and how to be responsible at
night," she said.
Gordon said she hopes the work-
shops will continue in the future to
ensure all future Panhel members
are educated about these issues.
"When you try to change a com-
munity, you have to start at the
youngest level so it can carry on
through," she said.

Trash the tickets
AAPD and students must cooperate on game day
ame day at the Big House is an experience unlike any
other. But for many students, football Saturdays start
down the street at friends' pre-game parties. This tra-
dition is especially strong in the University's Greek community
and the 900 block of State Street. But recently, students have
claimed that the Ann Arbor Police Department is unfairly tar-
geting them with noise and trash citations. A meeting last week
between AADP and students aimed to curb the number of tickets
issued. AAPD and the student community must work together to

On Nov. 5, AAPD Deputy Chief John
Seto met with members of the Michigan
Student Assembly and the Interfraternity
Council - the governing body of campus
fraternities - to discuss what constitutes
legitimate cause for police presence at
game day parties. Students sought to find
ways to stem what they allege is a recent
increase in ticketing and to determine how
their parties are being assessed for noise
and trash violations. A common complaint
among students is that they are not given
sufficient time to clean up before being
ticketed. Peri Silverman, the vice chair
of the Greek Relations Select Committee,
said in a Nov. 7 Daily article that "people
aren't able to gauge the situation."
It's in the best interest of city residents
for students to follow ordinances, rather
than giving them tickets to create easy
cash flow. A crucial step to solving the
problem of tickets is for students to under-
stand Ann Arbor city ordinances. Students
have an obligation as Ann Arbor residents
to follow city laws. But student turnover is
constant on campus, making it difficult to
be knowledgeable on all laws. The police
should also work with students to educate
them on city rules.
Students and AAPD should strive to cre-

ate a spirit of cooperation and compliance.
Police should permit students a reason-
able amount of time to clean up their yards
rather than immediately issuing tickets.
AAPD could warn students that their party
is getting too chaotic and give them an
opportunity to correct this problem before
writing them up. A loud and busy environ-
ment on campus is the reality of a college
town. AAPD needs to be understanding of
that and work with students rather than
hastily penalizing them.
Of course, there will always be students
who, even when granted sufficient time,
fail to clean their yards. Since the major-
ity of students rent their homes, they don't
feel as much responsibility for their prop-
erty. But this mentality is unacceptable.
Students have an obligation to respect and
follow Ann Arbor laws. Cooperation is a
two-way street. Students can't expect leni-
ency or understanding from AAPD or Ann
Arbor residents if they won't obey laws and
work with the city.
While AAPD must enforce the rules,
maintaining a cooperative relationship
with the student body is in everyone's best
interest. AAPD should work with the IFC
and MSA to clearly establish guidelines for
reasonable enforcement of city ordinances.

A reason to buy American

Take a look at the big picture

i

"Hey c'mon! We're all going to buy Buicks in
the alley behind the school!"
"Well, gee, my mom told me that's kind
of dangerous, and it usually makes my nose
bleed..."
"Whoa. Everyone's doing it. You don't want
to bea loser, do you?"
And we don't want to be losers, do we?
For the past couple decades, peer pressure
to buy American cars, especially in suburban
Detroit, has been high. We went and shot up
Chevys instead of hanging out with the new
Asian kid who was kind of boring but always
did well on tests or the sexy European exchange
students who didn't play by anyone's rules.
But because we caved into the pressure,
American automakers have suffered. After the
bottom fell out several years ago, however, the
Big Three (Ford Motor Co., General Motors
Corp., and Chrysler) are finally giving consum-
ers real reasons to buy American again.
In the 1990s and early this decade, consum-
ers bought American. Because sales were good,
the Big Three evenly motored on without much
pressure to innovate or improve engineering,
manufacturing or design. They did, however,
make cars bigger. They also sold nearly iden-
tical .cars through different brands (referred
to as brand engineering). The GMT-360 plat-
form, for instance, has been sold as different
models through six GM brand - most notably
as the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and
Oldsmobile Bravada. These aren't efficient or
sustainable business practices.
The Big Three rode high on sport utility
sales (fuel-gulping SUVs like the Jeep Chero-
kee and Ford Explorer) and were too content
swimming in profits and buying up random
companies to look in their rear-view mirrors.
If they did, they would have seen Asian rivals
looking ahead and leading in the types of vehi-
cles that are selling in spades today - small,
fuel-efficient and green.
The story from the late 1990s to the early
21st century is a sad one. Oil prices shot up to
as much as $5 per gallon in some places and
that whole economy thing sort of collapsed or
something. Americans, realizing that cars that
cost less to purchase, fuel and maintain was
the way to go, fully embraced East-Asian and

European automakers and Ford and GM real-
ized they didn't have the resources or skills
to run niche automakers they had purchased.
-Sales drastically dwindled. Companies mar-
ried and then had ugly divorces. Everyone
began to doubt the future of the Big Three.
I Several years and a bailout later, I'm endors-
ing something I never thought I would: buying
American. Nope, this isn't out of some hyper-
nationalistic epiphany or even sympathy.
It's far simpler: Ford, GM and Chrysler now
have the strongest model lineups in the indus-
try. The automakers finally rethought the
entire way product development is handled
and their new approach is working well.
The new Chevrolet Volt is one such example.
Long after its concept was revealed in 2007,
the electric vehicle is just hitting the streets
in North America and Europe. There is much
to praise. On Oct. 11, GM finally released long-
awaited details about the Volt. This press
release included an acknowledgement that at
high speeds, the engine, rather than the elec-
tric motor, directly powers the wheels. This
means that in official terms, the Volt is not a
pure electric vehicle. Angry blog posts, Tweets
and a hailstorm of bad press immediately fol-
lowed.
I'm not sure why so much emphasis was put
on the Volt's classification instead of its accom-
plishments. Just because the Volt doesn't fit
the exact definition of electric vehicle doesn't
change the fact that Motor Trend saw 126
MPG while testing it. or that Popular Mechan-
ics named it a Breakthrough Product.
A slew of other American products are
class-leaders and that trend continues to grow.
The Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Cruze are cur-
rently leading the small car revolution. The
Dodge Ram is constantly lauded as the num-
ber one pickup on the market. Six out of Popu-
lar Mechanics's 10 Best are American. Motor
Trend's Car of the Year was a Ford.
Americans, along with Europeans, Canadi-
ans and Asians, are buying - and should con-
tinue to buy - American cars not because they
feel they need to, but because the Big Three are
finally giving us cars we want.

And then there's me - somewhere
underneath the Arabic notes and psy-
chology pages, I'm diligently chipping
away at my workload. It's been an
unusually awful week for me, as it has
been for most of my friends.
So you can imagine my displea-
sure when 1 checked the calendar and
discovered I had a column due this
week. I don't have time to feed myself,
yet I'm expected to put together a
thought-provoking social commen-
tary? Quickly, my mind looks for an
easy answer. Maybe I'll just write
about Andrew Shirvell - there's plen-
ty of good material there. With time
ticking away, I needed a topic. But in
my quest to write a column, I was able
to put my current situation into some
much needed perspective.
When I need to pull a quick col-
umn idea out of my hat, I look to CNN.
com. Surely among the world's latest
buzz there is an idea just waiting to
be developed. First, there's the story
of the Carnival Cruise ship stranded
in the middle of the ocean. After a fire
broke out in one of the engine rooms
early Monday morning, the Carnival
Splendor lost power and operated
on auxiliary generators until it was

towed into port yesterday.
But while still stranded 130 miles
west of Ensenada, Mexico, with no
air conditioning and with plumbing
only recently being restored to the
boat, numerous cruisers checked into
the infirmary after suffering panic
attacks. The only thing I can imagine
more unbearable than an obnoxious
cruise-goer complaining about the
runniness of his Eggs Benedict is a
cruise-goer with no buffet or running
water. Truly, things could be worse
for me.
But then there was the story of the
Somali pirates who attacked a Spanish
warship with their stolen Japanese
freighter. Intent on attacking a ship
carrying peacekeeping supplies to
Somalia, the pirates instead engaged
in a skirmish with the Spanish Navy.
According to the European Union
Naval Force public affairs office, the
warship only used "minimal force."
This makes sense, as I imagine the
Somali pirates were heavily armed
with sharp stones and dirty insults.
Needless to say, the pirates scurried
away as quickly as their freighter
could take them (which is still proba-
bly fasterthan the Carnival Splendor).
Truly, things could be worse for me.
So no, I didn't discover a well-
packaged column idea that I could
crank outin 15minutes. And I walked
out of the Arabic midterm Tues-
day morning feeling degraded and
embarrassed. I have no doubt my pro-
fessor will get a few laughs out of my
attempt at an essay.
But somewhere between read-
ing about those stranded vacationers
and those desperate Somali pirates,
I gained a little perspective on life.
Sure, the test wasn't a total success.
But things in my life could certainly
be worse. Having a little perspec-
tive, especially around this time of
year, is important. We're all busy
now. With midterms slowing down
and finals gearing up, it's hard to
believe things could be worse than 2

a.m. Law Library sessions followed
by 10 a.m. Arabic midterms. But see-
ing life clearly, especially in a time of
year when it's difficult to see anything
clearly, is necessary.
Being able to study at the Univer-
sity - renowned for making smart
people feel stupid - is an honor.
Studying under some of the most
brilliant minds in our nation is a
gift, even if their lectures sometimes
make no sense. Sitting next to some of
the future thinkers and doers of our
generation is inspiring, even if these
thinkers and doers make long-winded
comments during discussion sections.
Arabic exams are


trivial in the grand
scheme of things.
I'm not trying to say that doing
well in your classes isn't important,
or that pulling consecutive all-night-
ers isn't a drag. But I've found that
we tend to lose perspective when we
cease to see the big picture. No single
test will define your college career.
These four years are about the accu-
mulated experiences and lessons that
will shape the next steps of our lives.
Turning one test or one paper into the
be-all end-all is the surest way to lose
sight of the big picture.
As exam season gears up and it
starts to seem like every professor is
judging your worth based on a Scan-
tron exam, keep in mind why you are
here and the value of every experi-
ence. Don't lose sight of that big pic-
ture and remember that life could
certainly be worse for you, a student
at an elite university.

ize "love" into a
laughably lowbrow domain.
Thankfully, the higher-brow
crowd tackles similar romantic
topics. Enter "The Real Thing,"
the RC Players's adaptation of
British playwright Tom Stop-
pard's 1982 production of the
same name. "The Real Thing"
profiles the infidelities of its lead
characters - Henry, a playwright,
and Annie, an actress - and the
messy relationships that encom-
pass them.
The RC Players is a student-run
troupe based out of East Quad that
performs student and profession-
al pieces. According to LSA junior
Sean FitzGerald, who directs the
play, the RC Players - which is
open to non-RC students as well -

usually performs two full-length
productions per semester. With
"The Real Thing," FitzGerald
makes his first full-length direc-
torial effort.
"It deals with a lot of themes
that I feel are consistent through-
out time," FitzGerald said. "Like,
what is love? How do you know
if what you think love is actually
is the real thing? Just a bunch of
themes that resonate with every-
one."
FitzGerald said Stoppard's
humor and the show's complexity
make "The Real Thing" an attrac-
tive choice for a student adaptation.
Starring in his first RC Play-
ers production, LSA senior Dante
Bugli headlines as Henry, an
adulterous and charismatic play-
wright. Bugli, who has performed

with campus theater organiza-
tions like Rude Mechanicals and
the University's Educational The-
atre Company, highlighted the
magnetic personality of Henry.
"He's really good at talking
over people, because he's a play-
wright," Bugli said. "He's quick,
he's witty, and so he always has a
lot of smart things to say and he
can tell people what he wants to
say and make people believe it."
Bugli stars opposite LSA soph-
omore Miriam Kamil, who plays
Annie, Henry's mistress and even-
tual wife. According toKamil, the
role of Annie presents somewhat
of a foreign personality.
"I've never played a charac-
ter so different from me," Kamij
said. "It's fun that she's 30, but she
sometimes acts like really young,
really naive. But sometimes it
seems like she's just pretending
to be naive, so she's really compli-
cated in that way."
Bugli and Kamil represent only
a small portion of the cast's age
diversity: According to FitzGer-
ald, the cast consists of a mix of
underclassmen and upperclass-
men, a balance praised by one of

the show's co-producers, LSA
sophomore Sophia Blumenthal,
who works alongside LSA senior
Rebecca Gutmann.
"We have a lot of new people in
this cast, and it's great to see how
the dynamic with everyone is so
pleasant," Blumenthal said.
Still, the production has not
been without its challenges. Par-
ticularly demanding, according
to FitzGerald, was adapting to
the scene changes required of a
distinctive production like Stop-
pard's.
"Scene changes normally are
very complex," FitzGerald said.
"(In the original script) they have
a circle stage that spins ... enabling
them to make quicker, more com-
plex scenes changes, but we don't
have the resources for that. So
I had to sit down and figure out
how I was going to accomplish the
'scenes."
These complexities, according
to FitzGerald, were remedied by
simply rearranging stage sets to
signal shifts in time and place.

pard's production might notice a

introduced to a
modern midwestern American
town. The pill is supposed to help
the townspeople accomplish their
dreams, but being merely a pla-

cebo, the pill's effects are solely
in the minds of its users. The per-
ceived effects of the pill drive the
dialogue, written by the Univer-
sity's own Joshua Borths, a junior
in the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance, with music created by
MT&D senior Danny Abosch.
"It's a story about dreams and,
you know, how far you're willing
to go to get what you dreamed of,"
Abosch explained. "It's also a love
story between Robert and Morgan,
and the story of how their love is
tested by this placebo pill."
Borths and Abosch began writ-
ing the musical a little over a year
ago and originally intended to
adapt Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi"
into musical format. Their creative
juices came together every Sunday
at Starbucks.
"The version we have today is
barely recognizable from the ver-
sion we started out with," Abosch
said. "(We'd) think of some really
cool idea that would negate the

whole idea we had thought of... but
that's the process - it changes, it
grows, it's a living piece of art."
Going from paper to the stage,
the casting process proved to be a
proud moment for the production's
directors.
"It's one thing to hear the work
how you invented it in your head,
but to hear real live actors perform-
ing your piece, it's so enlightening,"
Abosch said. "They bring so much
to the table and you learn so much
about a piece."
Being the music director, Abosch
had to compose the music toencom-
pass all elements of the play - from
its characters to its story to its
themes. A nine-piece orchestra will
perform the score.
"It takes a long time because you
have to set up the musical world of
the show. It's more than just writ-
ing the music, it's telling a story
through music," Abosch explained.
"I've written one other musical and

A cappella gets festive

Every year, nerves and excite-

the tight-knit University a cap-
pella community, one of the larg-
est in the country.
"As a freshman, I was so ner-
vous, because it's like you're
proving yourself to not only your
group and to the audience, but to
this huge a cappella community,"
said Chaz Cox president of the
Michigan A Cappella Council and
member of the all-male a cappella
group GMen.
MACFest features seven-minute
musical sets from 13 of the 15 a cap-
pella groups on campus. Since 2002
it has been organized by MACC,
which brings representatives from
the a cappella groups together to
talk about issues related to the
community and acts as a liaison to
the greater Ann Arbor area.
By assembling the groups to
perform, MACFest exemplifies
the purpose of MACC. The con-
cert is the main source of revenue
for MACC throughout the year,
and it can mobilize a solid follow-
ing for every campus a cappella
group.
"There are definitely groups
that have 'groupies,' if you will,
but those groupies quickly
become a cappella groupies when
they come to concerts like this,"
said MACC Vice President Lance
Fletke, member of Amazin' Blue.

'Date' Is due for some innoVation

Galifianakis and
Downey Jr. aren't
challenged on screen
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Film Editor
Hollywood has this terribly
frustrating tendency of jumping
on whatever is
fresh, popular
and exciting and W
riding it relent- Due Date
lessly until it
collapses, left At Quality16
sprawled out and and Rave
wheezing in the Warner Bros,
carpool lane of
Sepulveda Boule-
vard. "Transformers" was a global
smash, so they cranked out the
craptacular "G.I. Joe: The Rise of
Cobra," another movie based on a
Hasbro action figure. And Michael
Cera killed it as a meek, virginal
teen in "Superbad," so they had
him rework the same character in
"Nick and Norah," "Year One" and
more.
"Due Date," the new film from
Todd Phillips ("The Hangover"),
is yet another example of this, as
it's nothing more than an attempt
to piggyback on the popularity of
its two lead actors. The world was
treated to the miraculous emer-
gence of two actors over the past
few years: Robert Downey Jr., who
pulled his face out of a mountain

of cocaine and reclaimed Holly-
wood stardom with his endlessly
sarcastic performance in "Iron
Man," and Zach Galifianakis,
who was plucked from his career
of bizarre stand-up routines and
minor supporting roles to become
an overnight sensation with his
performance in "The Hangover."
The two were cast in "Due Date"
to play their divergent comedic
styles against each other, but the
movie fails precisely because it
forces the audience to watch them
play the exact same roles they
always do. In this movie, Downey
Jr.'s character is a mild variation of
Tony Stark as he spits out snarky
dialogue and Galifianakis once
again acts as a man-child who says
and does socially frowned-upon
(read: disgusting) things.
Even the greatest joke in the
world isn't as funny the umpteenth
time you hear it, and watching
"Due Date" shows how quickly
novelty can fade. Galifianakis was
uproarious in "The Hangover"
because his blend of non-sequiturs,
slapstick and deadpan delivery
had never been seen before. Simi-
larly, audiences were blindsided by
Downey Jr.'s samurai sword-sharp
wit in "Iron Man" that has since
become as dull as a butter knife
after "Iron Man 2" and "Sherlock
Holmes." The freshness of their
portrayals has faded away and the
audience is stuck with their same
old shtick for the entire movie.
And it doesn't help the film that

the plot is a complete clone of the
1987 classic "Planes, Trains and
Automobiles," another road-trip
movie in which a high-strung
businessman is forced to travel
across the country with an eccen-
tric fat guy he can't stand, plowing
through a series of unfortunate
events to make it home for Thanks-
giving - becoming fond of his trav-
eling partner along the way. Just
replace "Thanksgiving" with "the
birth of his first child" and you
have the story of "Due Date."
The characters are recycled and
the plot is a duplicate, but "Due
Date" is not a complete waste of
time. Much-needed cameos by
RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, Juliette
Lewis ("Conviction") and Danny
McBride (TV's "Eastbound and
Down") are spread intermittently
throughout the film and break the

constant barrage of Downey Jr.'s
clever cynicism and Galifianakis'
outrageous stupidity.
The movie works extremely
well when it decides to pause for
a handful of sentimental scenes
- coincidentally, this is where
Downey Jr. and Galifianakis's get
to break character and have intel-
ligent, moving discussions, act-
ing like actual human beings for a
change.
Despite all the criticism,
Downey Jr. and Galifianakis do
provide some quality laughs and
"Due Date" is definitely a lot fun-
nier than most movies out there.
But it deserves a harsh scolding for
acquiring such tremendous talent,
reprocessing characters and story
ideas, serving it up to the audi-
ence and calling it Lamb Vindaloo.
Lamb Vindaloonit is not.

worked on several other musical
projects, but this is by far the most
exciting."
With a completely original musi-
cal, the directors wanted to focus
on the story instead of creating an
elaborate set design or costumes.
"The audience (has the responsi-
bility) to create the scenery in their
mind," Abosch said. "It basically
revolves around one staircase piece
that will turn in various ways to
reveal the different locations."
Besides testing the limits that we
as people will cross to pursue what
we want, the musical also address-
es themes of naivety and testing
fate.
"The theme of the placebo, really
is ... the idea that ignorance is bliss..If

you think something is real, it might
as well be real," Abosch explained.
"It's kind of an interesting theme
when you think about what would
you do if you hada pill that could do
anything? Would you even take it?
Maybe it's better to not even mess
with that."
With the scarcity of student-
written musicals today, the Base-
ment Arts audience will be treated
to a notable experience, according
to Abosch.
"The idea of an original musical
is rare even on Broadway - every-
thing these days are adaptations
from books or movies or plays,
and the original musical is some-
thing that's not as often done any-
more," Abosch said. "No one has
ever heard this story before, and
the idea that we're able to tell this
story through music in its original
form, I think is a really cool oppor-
tunity."

difference in the RC Players's adap-
tation. Whereas the play originally
takes place in 1980s-era England,
the RC interpretation sets its char-
acters as Americans in New York.
In doing so, FitzGerald said he had
to shift the script to westernize any
"British-isms."
FitzGerald does not feel that
any of these minor changes, which
were employed to scale back pro-

duction and eliminate the poten-
tially difficult teachability of a
British accent, sacrifice Stoppard's
vision, saying that "all the core ele-
ments are still there."
FitzGerald hopes to impart an
overarching message upon audi-
ences.
"I want people to think about
their current relationships, their
past relationships, even what hap-
pens in the future," FitzGerald
said. "And kind of wonder about
the connections being made, and if
they are the'real thing.'"

'M' has edge aganst
reeling Purdue 'O'

Blue tops Michigan State,
moves on to Big Ten semis

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
If there's an offense in the Big
Ten that the Michigai defense
would want to face this week, it is
probably Purdue's. The Boilermak-
ers' have already lost starting quar-
terback Robert Marve, No. 1 wide
receiver Keith Smith and top run-
ning back Ralph Bolden to injuries
throughout the season. And in the
past three weeks Purdue has scored
a total of 23 points against Ohio
State, Illinois and Wisconsin.
Those Big Ten foes -have scored
a combined 127 points against Pur-
due.
Michigan (2-3 Big Ten, 6-3 over-
all) enters the contest coming off
its sixth win of the season, a triple-
over time victory over Illinois that
made the Wolverines bowl eligible
for the first time under Michigan
coach Rich Rodriguez. Offense was
not a problem for the Wolverines as
they scored 67 points against the

STATE COLLEGE - Just 10
days ago the Michigan men's soc-
cer team beat Michigan State, 3-2,
in a hard-fought rivalry game in
Ann Arbor. Yesterday, the Wol-
verines (12-4-3) accomplished the
same feat with only 10 men on the
field for the majority of the second
half, beating their in-state rival,
2-1, to advance to the Big Ten
semifinals.
As Michigan senior forward
Justin Meram was sent off the
field with a second yellow card for
excessive celebration, the heart
of an already anxious team sank
a little.
They were tied in the second
half of a single-elimination Big
Ten Tournament matchup. The
scene seemed all too familiar, mir-
roring the last meeting between
the two sides.
"At halftime, I thought our
guys were a little antsy," Michi-
gan coach Steve Burns said. "I had
to assure them that this is exactly
the kind of game that we wanted
to have and expected to have."
Just minutes into the second
half, Meram scored, but his cel-
ebration earned him a red card.
After Meram's goal and dismissal
from the game, the team showed
energy and maturity, rallying
around its dynamic duo - the
Saad brothers, Hamoody and
Soony.
"It was definitely difficult to
adjust to being a man down,"
freshman forward Soony Saad
said after the game. "But that
being said, I think we did really
well when it came to our defend-
ing and keeping our discipline."
Being a man down made a dif-
ference, but not the one that peo-
ple expected.
"I thought that it really hurt

MICHIGAN RUN OFFENSE VS.
PURDUE RUN DEFENSE
Michigan sports the nation's
ninth-best rushing attack led by
Robinson who still leads the NCAA
in rushing yards despite running
for a season-low 62 yards last week
againstthe Fighting Illini.
The Wolverines had quality
contributions from Vincent Smith,
Mike Shaw and Stephen Hopkins
last week - the trio carried the load
that Robinson usually shoulders.
Purdue defensive end Ryan
Kerrigan is a standout, but Michi-
gan has been able to run on every
team it has played this year -don't
expect anything to change this
week.

MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS.
PURDUE PASS DEFENSE
Sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson threw for a career-high
305 yards on just 10 completions
last week. He threw two intercep-
tions in the first quarter but con-
nected with redshirt sophomore
Roy Roundtree on two big comple-
tions in a high-scoring second quar-
ter.
Purdue's secondary will have
a hard time handling Roundtree,
Stonum and redshirt junior wide
receiver Junior Hemingway on the
outsides, especially with Robinson
returning to action.

EDGE: MICHIGAN
PURDUE RUN OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN RUN DEFENSE
Purdue could get a boost from
the absence of Michigan linebacker
Jonas Mouton, who is questionable
for Saturday's game with a strained
muscle in his chest. The Boilermak-
ers'only redeeming asset on offense
could be their running game, which
averages more than 175 yards per
game behind leading passer Dan
Dierking- a fullback.
With the loss of Bolden due to
an injury, the Boilermakers have
resorted to using multiple backs
and quarterbacks to get the job
done.
Michigan looked like it was
swarming to the ball against Illi-
nois and gang tackling running
backs.
But the Wolverines still strug-
gled to slow down Jacob Ford and
Mikel Leshoure.

The negative attention has shift-

Purdue kicker Carson Wiggs

At the beginning of the season,
Michigan coach Greg Ryan met
with his players and together they
set a goal for the season: make the
NCAA Tournament. In previous
years, such an aspiration might
have seemed bold and nearly
impossible to achieve, consider-
ing their inexperience and recent
trend of losing seasons.
Ryan said his teams of the past
simply "lacked the attacking tal-

ent to go after teams," comparing
them to a "boxer on the ropes, play-
ing defensively and trying to keep
games tight."
But this is a new year.
"The culture and chemistry of
the players this year has been fan-
tastic," Ryan said. "We have a huge,
very talented freshman class that
has blended seamlessly with a tal-
ented group of returning players.
The combination just turned into
an outstanding season."
The season has been highlight-
ed by an abundance of nail-biting
games, seven of which went into
double overtime. If the team wants
to continue its success, it will have
do so on the road.
"We're just going to play our
game," Ryan said. "They're going
to go after us and we're going to
go after them. I don't think either
team is going to back off."
Ryan hopes the Wolverines (5-3-
2 Big Ten, 10-4-4) will continue the
aggressive style that has been their
trademark all year.
"Going forward, we're going to
pretty much play an attacking style
of soccer and go after our oppo-
nents, regardless of what they're
ranked," Ryan said.
Emotions were running high

Monday after the team was chosen
second to last during the selec-
tion show for the tournament. The
team erupted at the announce-
ment, jumping up and down in ela-
tion.
"They are so happy to have taken
the team back to the NCAA Tour-
nament, to have rebuilt a strong
program at Michigan," Ryan said.
"But they're still very focused and
determined to win this weekend."
Regardless of how his team per-
forms in the tournament, Ryan is
extremely proud of what they have
accomplished already.
"One of the big things for me as
a head coach and for the rest of the
team was to send our seniors out
as winners, as players that worked
their way back into the NCAA
Tournament, an achievement that
they have never experienced,"
Ryan said. "We are so happy that
this senior class can go out and
know they helped rebuild Michi-
gan into a great soccer program
once again."
But there is still an opportunity
to continue the memorable season,
starting tonight at 8:30 p.m. The
winner will play on Sunday against
the winner of the Memphis/Ore-
gon State matchup.

Blue prepared for injury-plagued Boilermakers

Daily SportsEditor Michigan's anemic secondary this
Saturday. But the Wolverines know

There's no doubt that the Wol-
verines' defense, and especially
their secondary, has been ravaged
by injuries this season.
But when looking at Purdue's
offense, another injury-depleted
corps, Michigan's defense should
definitely be counting its blessings.
The Boilermakers lost their No.
1 quarterback, Robert Marve; No. 1
running back Ralph Bolden; and No.
I wide receiver, Keith Smith, all to
ACL tears this season. Then, after
mobile quarterback Rob Henry took
over for Marve, he suffered an inju-
ry himself and is still dealing with a
hand laceration that has bothered
him for more than two weeks.

Rodriguez said this week that

and that was why the Wolverines
held him out. I
"He had some signs or symp-

Rodriguez said Monday. "Certainly
for precautionary reasons, the
trainers wanted to hold him out."
But he'll be OK for this week-
end's matchup, and with Michigan
focused on improving their bowl
standing, this matchup with Purdue
may be its best chance to put anoth-

INJURY UPDATE: Rodriguez said

during Wednesday's teleconfer-
ence that the Wolverines could be
without senior linebacker and Big
Ten tackling leader Jonas Mouton,
who's dealing with a chest injury.
He's listed as questionable on this
week's injury report.
"I don't think there's structural
damage," Rodriguez said. "But
there's muscular issues that are
causing some pain, and it's kind of a
day-to-day thing. He's -a tough guy,
and if he can play and is cleared by
the trainers, he'll be ready to go."
