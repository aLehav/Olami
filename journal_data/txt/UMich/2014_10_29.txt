HEALTH
UHS wait
increases as
flu season
approaches

Students report
frustration with
accessibility to
campus service
By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT
Daily Staff Reporter
Despite reporting high over-
all patient satisfaction, Univer-
sity Health Service - the primary
health care center for the Univer-
sity's campus community - has
reported longer than average wait
times this semester, causing con-
cern for some students.
UHS Medical Director Rob-
ert Ernst, who has served as a
physician and administrator for
11 years, said waiting times this
semester have been particularly
lengthy due to understaffing
issues.
"I can tell you that wait time
for next available appointment
has been running more like a
week instead of 24 hours," Ernst

With global

'U' sponsors

By IRENE PARK
Daily StaffReporter
In today's interconnected
society, health issues in one
country are hardly problems for
that particular nation alone.
' When the World Health
Organization called a meeting
last Thursday to discuss the
development and distribution
of Ebola vaccines, the gathering
included representatives from
governments, the pharmaceu-
tical industry, research insti-
tutions and medical nonprofit
groups.
Traditionally, non-govern-
mental organizations like the
WHO have been the dominant
figures in global health research
compared to universities.
However, Joseph Kolars,
the director of the University's
Global Research, Education,

said. "That puts a lot of pressure
on same-day resources."
Currently, one physician is on
sabbatical, and a nurse practitio-
ner and a physician assistant have
left. This has put added strain on
remaining staff members, espe-
cially with the traditionally busy
cold and flu season approaching.
Engineering senior Kevin
Kacan said he observed such
understaffing in recent visits.
"They don't have enough nurs-
es to keep up with the demand for
allergy shots and immunizations,
so that's a problem," Kacan said.
"And as someone that pays tuition
to this University, it's frustrating
that the building itself is under-
staffed forthenumberofstudents
there are and that we're forced
to go to hospitals and pay out-of-
pocket expenses."
Engineering junior Dylan
Brown said he's heard of others
who have had lengthy waiting
times at UHS.

University President
discusses issues of
diversity, sexual

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily News Editor
The lunch fare was light but
the conversation was substan-
tive as students in the LSA
Honors Program were invited

to spend an hour dining and
engaging in a discussion with
University President Mark
Schlissel Tuesday afternoon.
Schlissel kicked off the event
by keeping the mood casual,
calling ita relief from talking to
alumni about football.
"I've been on the job for a
little over three months, my
first 100 days was sometime last
week, and things were going
absolutely great until I realized
we have a football team who
people pay a lot of attention to,

and then it started going less
great," he said with a laugh.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
Schlissel added that he loves
football, but feels that the team
having a bad year can often
drown out all of the other activi-
ties around campus. He added
that he was surprised about the
extent to which people are pas-
sionate about hot issues in ath-
letics.
He also said he's been in dis-
cussion with presidents of com-

parable universities and that the
campus cultures are similar in
regards to the role of athletics.
At the lunch, Schlissel
detailed some of his life expe-
riences that culminated in'his
nomination as the 14th president
of the University, including his
studies as an undergraduate at
Princeton University followed by
medical school and a doctorate at
The Johns Hopkins University.

SCHLISSEL

enough financial aid and being lucky
enough to go to Princeton as an
undergrad," Schlissel said. "That's
where I really learned that smart
people, talented people, successful
people who rule the world are actu-
ally no different fromyou and me."
Continuing to detail his college
experiences, Schlissel spoke about
what it was like to attend school
alongside the children of senators,
congressmen and famous actors.
"It turned out that they were really
no different than the people I went
to public school with," he said. "The
first thing I really learned in college
is that people are people no matter
where they come from. There's not a
huge difference between people who
grow up under normal circumstances
and people who grow up in the news."
Schlissel also discussed his goals
for the University during his tenure,
which will last at least five years per
the terms of his contract. He said
his primary goals for the Univer-
sity include enhancing its status as a
prominent public research university
and becoming accessible to a wider,

more diverse range of people from
around the state and the country.
"Access, affordability and diversity
are all obligations of a great public
university," Schissel said. "It's very
expensive to get an education here
..I have to organize the way we run
the University, the way we deal with
financial aid and fundraise so that the
decision to come to Michigan is not a
financial one."
Schlissel also said he was dissat-
isfied with how difficult it's been to
make the University look like the
public it serves.
"I'm completely convinced that
talent is uniformly distributed in our
population. The difference is that
opportunity is not," he said. "I think
all of us in this room have been the
beneficiaries of not only your own tal-
ent, but many opportunities in your
life that allowed you to come here. I
think there are multiples of people
that are every bit as smart as me and
you who didn't come here, who could
really benefit from this education."
Schlissel said it's his job as presi-
dent to find these talented people and
find a way to make coming to the Uni-
versity an attainable goal for them,
and that diversity will continue to
remain a priority.
The second half of the session was

reserved for students' questions and
concerns, which Schlissel also used
as an opportunity to pick students'
brains regarding changes they'd like
to see on campus and their views on
the best solutions.
Some students raised questions
about the University's action and
progress regarding sustainability on
campus, making the big campus feel
smaller, centralizing global issues for
educational purposes, gender dispar-
ities among math and science majors,
potential tuition caps and freezes and
sexual assault awareness and pre-
vention. Schlissel provided feedback
for each question and often encour-
aged students to expand on their own
thoughts and potential solutions.
For example, Schlissel said the
University sponsors several techno-
logical projects that no other college
campus or research university is par-
ticipating in, but due to the energy
they require, we often don't meet
criteria for third party sustainability
initiatives or challenges.
With regard to sexual assault, one
student said she'd like to see a shift
in campus culture from awareness
to prevention, ultimately allowing all
students to feel safer on and off cam-
pus.
"This is probably one of the top'

two or three issues Michigan faces, as
does every institution," Schlissel said.
Schlissel added that sexual assault
is such a difficult conversation to
have on college campuses because of
its sensitive nature, but the Univer-
sity, students and the justice system
can all do things to make the situa-
tion better.
"Even talking about this topic is
extremely difficult because people
tense up and it's personal and emo-
tional for all of us," he said. "The
University will continue to work on
its own internal procedures to try
to develop procedures for victims of
assault, and people who are accused
of assault also deserve fair treat-
ment."
In his interview with The Daily,
Schlissel said he felt the meeting was
very productive and he was glad he
got to hear the voices of some of the
University's undergraduates.
"It's most of my job. I'm first and
foremost a teacher; I've spent over
20 years teaching all different kinds
of courses, undergrads, medical stu-
dents," he said. "One of the reasons I
wanted to take this job was to influ-
ence education, and to do that job
well I have to hear the kinds of things
we heard today, from the students
who are living the experience here'."

memory here," Steele said. "I have
watched the campus change."
Currently, the regents are
accessible through e-mail and
phone to commenters, as well as
give the public the opportunity
to speak during the public com-
ments portion of their monthly
meetings.
Steele said his primary initia-

tive - to increase transparency at
the University - involves hosting
public office hours to engage with
the community both on campus
and rotating office hours in dif-
ferent districts of the state.
"The students, let alone the
faculty and some administrators,
are hungry for this," Steele said.
"They want (to give their) input."
Steele noted that this initiative
was part of his platform in 2012.
Lack of administrative trans-
parency has been an ongoing
topic of conversation over the last

few years. In July, The Detroit
Free Press sued the University
over violations of the Open Meet-
ings Act in regards to the Regents
monthly meetings.
"We are elected statewide and
yet have no interaction with the
public," Steele said. "It is just
astounding to me."
Steele said he intends for these
hours to not only be for the fac-
ulty, staff and administrators, but
also the people who live in the city
and run the city.
Additionally, if elected, Steele

said he would initiate posting the
checkbook and budget publicly
online. According to Steele, the
Regents need to represent the
state and the taxpayers' view of
their state-chartered University.
In 2011, state appropriations
were cut 15 percent. The past
three years, however, funding
for higher education has been on
the rise, including a 6.1-percent
increase for the 2015 fiscal year.
"This state appropriation in
essence is the venture capital that
allowed the University to flour-

ish," Steele said. "The Univer-
sity has used that venture capital
extremely well. They have par-
layed into this $9-billion endow-
ment and this incredible physical
plant that you see here."
With this investment comes
responsibility, Steele said.
"The University must abso-
lutely do more to propel and assist
in the future of the state," Steele
said. "I think we need to work on
making sure our best and bright-
est come here and are encouraged
to stay, as a way to pay back the

state, a return on investment."
Steele proposes that the Uni-
versity grants tuition refunds
to students who graduate with
STEM degrees and stay in the
state for five years. He said this
program should be funded by the
University'sendowmenttoensure
state taxpayers receive their best
possible return on investment.
"We don't want them to come
here and then leave - we need
them to stay in the state, we need
to encourage them," Steele said.

Ernst attributed possible
negative student perception to
a bump in same-day visits to
the clinic. The month of Sep-
tember, the number of patients
in the same-day appointment
clinic increased from 1,400 in
2012 to more than 2,000 in 2014.
The number of students seen by
appointment has remained the
same since 2013.
The longest waits are associ-
ated with same-day visits, which
leads to disgruntled students.
Ernst said one commonly
trotted-out opinion from stu-
dents and parents is that the

quality of care at UHS is lower
than what would be expected
from a University of Michigan
Health System hospital or clin-
ic, or a local family medicine
center.
"I feel really conflicted about
that because I think that's a gen-
eral misunderstanding, because
I've not heard that so much from
actual users," Ernst said.
Kimble said though she
wishes service was improved,
the staff is nevertheless com-
5 petent.
"I do think the doctors them-
selves are very caring and very
thorough," Kimble said.
Ernst said health provid-
ers come to college campuses
especially to focus on young
adult well-being, and that this
commitment shows through at
UHS.
"It's really more important
for parents to know that people
don't go to practice in a college
health service program unless
" they are really committed to
taking care of students," Ernst
said.

CSG

with policy solutions outlined in
a change.org petition by activ-
ist Shaun King and the Dream
Defenders - a social justice
organization from Florida.
LSA senior Michael Chrzan
said this resolution differed
greatly from earlier resolutions
because it was more University-
centered.
"The resolution focused more
on this campus as far as what
students at Michigan can actu-
ally do to address the issue of
police brutality," Chrzan said.
In addition, the resolution
said the authors of the resolution
will partner with the Commis-
sion on Student Safety and Secu-
rity to host an event focused on
dialogue about police brutality.
"The event will feature dis-
cussion about what police bru-
tality is to bring awareness to
this campus," Chrzan said. "We
also want to talk about how we
can proactively work to make
sure issues of police brutality
don't happen here at the Univer-
sity and how we can maintain a
safe campus."
Further details about the
event will be announced Nov. 15.
Introduction of resolution
to amend Constitution of the
Student Body of Ann Arbor
CSG representatives intro-
duced a resolution to amend the
nomination process for justices
in the Central Student Judiciary.
The resolution will grant CSG

members the power to recom-
mend potential candidates for
seats within CSJ, as well as grant
the CSG President the authority
to approve those nominations.
The current nomination pro-
cess, which has existed since
1979, allows only returning jus-
tices to nominate new candi-
dates for seats, and the assembly
members are only allowed to
participate in the votes to con-
firm those nominations.
Law student Justin Kingsolv-
er, CSG Student General Coun-
sel, worked alongside other CSG
representatives in drafting the
resolution, and said the amend-
ments to the constitution will
help make CSG assembly mem-
bers more active in the judiciary
appointment process.
"We want the assembly mem-
bers involved in the nomination
process from stage one," King-
solver said. "We want assembly
members to also be able to rec-
ommend candidates, rather than
only returining justices choosing
the remainder of the judiciary."
Kingsolver and the rest of
the authors of the resolution
acknowledge that the existing
process for Justice selection has
been successful in selecting the
highest quality justices, but the
new resolution will ensure that
CSG will truly embody a demo-
cratic student government.
The CSG assembly plans
to vote on the resolution next
Tuesday.
Introduction of resolution to
increase accountability for
CSG legislative discretionary
funds
With substantial funds

available for allocation to
partnered student organizations
this year, the assembly also
discussed a new resolution to
amend how they allocate funds
to partnered organizations.
The resolution seeks to
standardize and formalize the
existing process by requiring
student organizations to sign
a grant agreement before they
are allocated requested funds
toward their organizations.
CSG Treasurer Alex Abdun-
Nabi, an LSA senior and one of
the authors of the resolution,
said the grant agreement will
require student organizations to
adhere to certain stipulations set
by CSG.
"The grant agreement will
give CSG the authority to
impose certain conditions on
student organizations," Abdun-
Nabi said. "We want to make
sure we're funding things we've
agreed to fund, and not things
we didn't."
The grant agreement will
require student organizations to
provide receipts demonstrating
how funds from CSG have been
spent. Itwill also statethatifthis
condition is not met, repayment
will be required.
Overall, Abdun-Nabi said
the resolution will hold
organizations that request
funding from CSG more
accountable for how they spend
those funds.
"The student body
contributes to the budget that
is for allocation to student
organizations," Abdun-Nabi
said. "We want to ensure that
all money allocated is spent
effectively and appropriately."

RC Players to put
on 'Rocky Horror'

Cult classic show
to premiere in
shadow-cast at
East Quad
By CAROLINE FILIPS
For The Daily
Each Halloween, we savor
our limited time to partake in
costume-hunting and candy-
buying, but
above all, relish Rocky
the yearly Horror
reemergence Hrrr
of "The Rocky Picture
Horror Picture Show
Show." At least,
that's what Oct.31 and
true followers Nov.A at 8 p.m.
do. Keen Theater,
The original EastQuad
hyper- Free
sexualized,
partly sci-fi,
over-the-top cult classic, "The
Rocky Horror Show," written by
Richard O'Brien, emerged as a
low-budgetproductioninLondon
in 1973. It later gained popularity
and appeared in the U.S., where it
was reincarnated on Broadway.
When it reached Hollywood in
1974, the film version directed
by Jim Sharman became wildly
popular and has since developed
a multi-generational cult
following.
"Rocky Horror" focuses on
the conventional characters
of Brad and Janet and their
unconventional adventures. After
their car stalls in a rainstorm,
their off-route excursions lead
them to a castle that is home to
the alien race, Transylvanians.
The couple is quickly thrown
into a delightful transsexual
experience.
The dialogue is partially
based on 1950s pop-culture
references, many of which are
called out during the show.
Much of the show mimics the
social transitions of the era, such
as the emergence of rock itself
manifesting into everyday life.
A devoted fan will be one who

yells out seemingly incongruous
words and phrases that instantly,
transform the actors' words into
vulgar one-liners.
This year, The RC Players are
presenting a free Halloween
showing of "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show." The show will
take place on Friday and Saturday
at 8 PM in East Quad's Keene
Theater, and it's anticipated to
generate a crowd as large and
lively as the Transylvanians
doing the time warp.
This is the RC's first
performance of "Rocky Horror,"
and LSA sophomore Katrina
Hamann's directorial debut with
the shadow-casted rendition of
the show.
"We're doing ashadow-cast,so
it's not like a full show," Hamann
said. "Basically the actors are
going to be pantomiming all the
movements of what's going on,
on the screen behind them. The
movie will be projected on the
stage."
Shadow-casting "Rocky
Horror" is widely popular, as it
adds an element of interaction
between audience and actors
and that touch of eccentricity
that the show is famous for. LSA
Junior Paris La Rock, cast as
Magenta the maid in the show,
believes that the movie will be
acting as the actors shadow, not
vice versa.
"What's fun is how we lip-
sync and mouth all the words
which adds to that campiness,"
La Rock said. "It adds to what
'Rocky Horror' is all about, that
illusion ... like man, woman,
what are you? And now it's like,
who's really singing? Is it us or
is it them? It's putting on that
performance."
Though shadow-casted
versions of "Rocky Horror"
are popular, Hamann designed
this rendition to appeal to both
"Rocky Horror" veterans and,
virgins alike. In true Rocky
Horror spirit, she confirmed that
the show will include a virgin
sacrifice - a surprise to those
who have never experienced the
show.
"It'll be very sexual, just

addingalittle bitextra,"Hamann
said. "It's all movement-based.
We're going to work with the
body a lot more."
To prepare for the musical
extravaganza, Hamann
experienced little difficulty
finding her ideal cast. After
having potential members dance
to "Time Warp" and other songs;
she was utterly impressed by all,
but those who made the cut were
comfortable with their bodies
and not afraid to emulate the
show's raunchiness. She knew she
wanted confident, energetic, cast-
members who had no inhibitions
- and that's exactly what she got.
"Our cast is awesome and
they're all really energetic and
know the show really well, so
I think it'll be very exciting,"
Hamann said. "I'm just worried
that the Keene won't be able to
hold enough people."
La Rock , the Junior cast
to play Magenta, anticipates a
large crowd as well, who will
take advantage of the holiday
combined with the utter chaos of
"Rocky Horror."
"I feel like most people will
come dressed up," La Rock said.
"People come with their own
props, like on the screen someone
says 'a toast!' People will throw
toast, people will come with their
own toasts, or water guns, or
newspapers."
Although there is controversy
over the deeper meaning of
"Rocky Horror" and whether or
not it set out to establish its cult
following, this portrayal aims to
be less contrived and more about
establishing a fun and carefree
environment for the audience.
"It can be interpreted however
you want it to," Hamann said.
"I think the bottom line is it's
supposed to make people feel
good, it's supposed to get people
hyped up."
Hamann is confident iin
her cast's ability to deliver an
unforgettable experience.
"It's a lot of dancing, a lot
of cross-dressing, a lot of
awesomeness. It's really fun, it's
kind of nonsense," Hamann said.
"It's crazy, it's a classic."

and Collaboration in Health pro-
gram, said universities must take
a more active role in tackling
global health issues.
"Universities ingeneral should
be struggling with the problems
of the common good and how to
be relevant to the problems of
the society," Kolars said.
Founded in 2001, Global
REACH is an organization at the
University Medical School that
aims to create an institution-
wide organization for improving
global health and healthcare.
Last year, faculty members
associated with Global REACH
secured $127 million in grants
from outside institutions for
global health-related research
and authored more than a hun-
dred publications related to the
topic of global health.
The program also fosters
partnerships with institutions
around the world to promote
clinical research. The Joint
Institute for Translational and
Clinical Research, for example,
is a partnership between the
University and Peking Univer-
sity Health Science Center in
China that focuses on cardiovas-
cular, liver, pulmonary and renal
disease.
In addition to collaborating

improve the financial situation for

mote clinical research, Global
REACH supports interdisciplin-
ary projects not only in medicine
and public health, but also in
education, engineering, business
and public policy.
The Ethiopia-Michigan
Platform for Advancing Col-
laborative Engagement has
also established partnerships
between the University and
Ethiopian institutions.
The first team of students
traveled to Ethiopia this past
summer. The students focused
on one of four themes: water
and environmental science and
engineering, science teach-
ing, encouraging private sector
engagement in public health
care provision or maternal
health technology.
Jamila Yakubu, program
manager of the Ethiopia Plat-
form, said the program is inter-
disciplinary by design.
"Both faculty and student
participants were very interdis-
ciplinary," she said. "The goal of
the program is to not just focus
on medicine but to bring in par-
ticipants (from) across the Uni-
versity."
Global REACH is currently
engaged in projects in five coun-
tries: Brazil, China, Ethiopia,
Ghana and India. Broader col-
laboration usually stems from
partnerships between two facul-
ty members or laboratories that

branch out into larger networks.
Though partnerships abroad
are not unique to the Univer-
sity, Kolars said Global REACH
alliances emphasize sharing the
responsibility for funding and
decision-making.
"(The Joint Institute for
Translational and Clinical
Research) is jointly funded and
jointly administered," he said.
"And each grant proposed for
funding has to have faculty
members from both institu-
tions."
Dedicating a team of scholars
to track needs and goals of the
partnering institutions also con-
tributes to success, especially
when the institutions are locat-
ed in two different countries.
Collaboration Core, a pro-
gram of the Joint Institute, was
established to help facilitate the
partnership between University
and Peking University.
Amy Huang, Global REACH's
director for China programs,
said the Core is responsible for
researching the science of col-
laboration and formulating
strategies for successful com-
munication and project manage-
ment.
"The members (of the Core)

and dorms, in order to attract
students.
"We have highly qualified
candidates and they are going to
come here if they are accepted,"
Steele said. "They aren't coming
here whether we have the wood
burning oven or not."
Today, higher education is
still driven dramatically by the
degree, Steele said. He believes
this could be changing drasti-
cally as alternative methods of
education become available and
people consuming education do
not care about the credit.
"If that happens the higher
education disruption is going to
be insane," Steele said. "It will be
like landlines versus cellphones."
Coursera is a prime example
of this future, Steele noted.
"I think the University of
Michigan is far more likely to
weather that storm because we
have so much research here and
we have a lot of students who
need to be here physically on the
campus," Steele said.
For Steele, a critical function
of the Regents is to understand
this change.
"We need to have a board that
understands these potential dis-
ruptions with large organiza-
tions with big fixed capital costs
in this transition that is driven by
technology."

In July, Wayne State University
announced a 30-percent decrease
in tuition for classes taken in the
spring and summer semesters of
2015.
To improve the student loan
program and decrease taxpayer
expenses, Steele proposes that
the University finance the student
loan program through the unre-
stricted portion of the endow-

"The University has plenty of

horse power in their endowment
to fund their own student loans, a
hundred percent," Steele said.
Beyond financial initiatives,
Steele said he believes higher edu-

be at the forefront of this.

Common sense policies

An open letter to the bagel judges

The Michigan football program has
been in the spotlight recently for
a variety of issues - what hasn't
received attention, howev-
er, is the culture that sur-
rounds it. But it needsto be.
On any given football Sat-
urday, groups of students
tailgate or pregame the
football games - regard-
less of whether or not they
actually attend. If you've
walked down Hill Street or VICTORIA
South University Avenue NOBLE
on one of these mornings,
you've probably seen huge
pre-parties:the masses of students dancingon
tables and lawns with red cups, walking from
house to house in huddled masses.
You've heard the cheers, the laughter.
But you've also probably heard police and
ambulance sirens and seen students in
handcuffs or strapped to a gurney. This
isn't a University-specific problem, but the
inextricable link between tailgating culture
and what happens on campus some Saturdays
is a problem that affects many students. To
make matters worse, current policies fail
to adequately address_
the problem.
Alcohol use among col- Having
lege students is well stud-
ied and well documented. school pol
According to the recently
published National College clearly cc
Health Assessment, 70 per- accepter
cent of University under-
graduate students sampled harms the
self-reported to have con-
sumed alcohol in the past
30 days. Asking students to
self-report a potentially illegal behavior, even
anonymously, isn't an infallible practice. But
even taking the numbers at face value, it's clear,
that a helltof a lot more students are drinking
than are legally permitted to do so.
Certainly not everyone drinks at the
University, and campus data from the NCHA
actually suggests that many Undergraduate
students overestimate the amount that others
are drinking. However, the prevailing culture
at the University, especially on football
Saturdays, places an inordinately high value
on alcohol to fuel partying. Freedom from
parents, easy access and permissive attitudes
toward its overconsumption tend to reinforce
this culture.
To moststudents readingthis, whatI've said
so far is probably old news. But, the University,

the state and national policies that govern
alcohol consumption for underage students
often blatantly ignore the realities of college
life that are clear to the majority of students.
On paper, the policies strictly forbid underage
drinking. But, because they so clearly conflict
with prevalently accepted norms, underage
drinking laws are all but impossible to evenly
enforce on college campuses. As a result, the
enacted policies accomplish only a small
fraction of what they were intended to while
simultaneously causing a lot of harm.
For example, at the game against Michigan
State last weekend, Lansing Police arrested 101
individuals, mainly for "underage drinking and
disorderly conduct," according to the Lansing
State Journal. For anyone who attended the
game or saw pictures of the tailgates on social
media, this number seems remarkably low,
but for the relatively few students who were
ticketed for drinking underage, that citation
could have a lasting impact.
Further, having a law or school policythat so
clearly contradicts accepted culture harms the
law itself. Instead of instilling respect for the
law, policies like this condition an irreverent,
it only matters if Iget caught attitude. Because
the success of any law itself depends to an
extent on the willingness
of the public to submit
a law or to the constraints it
imposes, it's important
icy that so that students enter society
as people who understand
ntradicts the importance and value
d culture of justice and civil order.
Instead, many students
law itself. fear law enforcement
personnel and treat laws
with the same subjectivity
that they approach things
like political gestures.
Because that's what they've become. Save
for medical amnesty, the policies surrounding
underage drinking are coloredhy the:political ;
pressure to maintain a tough stance against
dangerous adolescent behaviors.
But underage drinking isn't what causes
the most harm - binge drinking is. Maintain-
ing strict laws against drunk driving (perhaps
even the zero tolerance law for those under 21)
while also adopting more relaxed policies for
low BACs of college-aged students may help
address this in a more manageable and equita-
ble way. Itcould, in the process, decrease binge
drinking by legitimizing responsible drinking.

Now that you've released a list

What was it about "Bilbo

How about "Bagel Baggins"? No?
Were "The Bagel Identity," "The

copyright concerns? Or because
we chose not to include "The Bagel

Did you find "Ceci nest pas

were you afraid of legal action by

Why you should vote

I'll never forget my first time voting as a
student. It was in 2011 and I was voting in
the local Ann Arbor elections. I was excited
to finally have a say in electing leaders who
would represent me and make decisions that
would directly impact my life.
As a child, I would always accompany my
mother to the polls and step inside the ballot
box with her. Sometimes she would let me fill
in the bubbles for her and I would get an "I
voted" sticker to wear like a badge of honor.
This time though, I was voting on my own
issues, based on research that I had done. I
was filling out the ballotbased on my own per-
sonal views, and at the time, nothing seemed
more exciting than voicing my own opinion.
When I eventually fed my completed ballot
into the machine, the sticker that I received
finally resonated with me: I had voted.
I'll never forget the importance of that
election. While there were nothing "sexy"
to vote for on that ballot, like the president,
governor or members of Congress, each issue
that I voted on had importance that could
change my very own day-to-day life.
The upcoming election this Nov. 4 is
equally, if not more, important than my first
election in 2011, as well as each election
since. While decisions made at the federal
level might take months or years to affect us
at the statewide or local level, choices made
by our governor and state legislators have
immediate and lasting impacts.
That's why voting in local, gubernatorial
and presidential elections is so important.

It's up to us to elect leaders who are going to
do what's best for our education system, our
communities and us. And in statewide and
local elections, every single vote counts.
If you have any questions about issues on
the ballot, where your polling place is, how to
submit an absentee ballot or something else
entirely, you can visit the Michigan Election
Coalition's website at mielectioncoalition.org.
MEC is a coalition of non-partisan, non-profit
organizations working to improve citizen
engagement in the democratic process, and
their website is a good place to get voting
questions answered.
The Michigan Election Coalition,
a coalition of nonpartisan, nonprofit
organizations working to increase citizen
engagement with democracy, has created a
new website that makes voting easier. It even
has guidelines specifically for students. Visit
the site at mielectioncoalition.org if you have
any questions about the issues on the ballot,
where your polling place is, how to submit an
absentee ballot or something else entirely.
This November, whether it's your first
time or you've already got some experience
under your belt, get out and exercise your
most fundamental right to vote. It's your duty
to yourself, your family, your peers and your
future.
The experiences we have in college will
stick with us for our entire lives - make
voting one of them.
Jesse Buchsbaum is LSA senior.

During a time in which this
nation appears to be mired in
panic and fear over threats to our
security, such as Ebola or ISIS, our
confidence in Congress has shrunk
to approximately 12 percent. Voter
turnout is hitting all-time lows, and
yet we still find ourselves expecting
a different result each time they
take place.
In the latest midterm election of
2010, only one quarter of all able-
voters in the age group 18 to 29 cast
their decisions. Midterm elections
already have notoriously poor
turnout rates, and yet, as we have
seen through the Congressional
stagnation in the past few months,
if we don't elect competent officials
to lead us, we will consistently have
poor results.
Due to the stringent party
politics we have been seeing in
the past few years, it has become
increasingly difficult to get to know
a candidate's individual beliefs and
ideas without doing a significant
amount of research. Often our
perception and understanding of
the candidates we see on our ballots
on ElectionDayis largelycomprised
of the thousands of attack ads we
see and mute in the weeks leading
up to our elections. This is why we
see so many people walking into a
voting booth only knowing a single
name on the ballot, and choosing
whatever name they're vaguely
familiar with.
People tend to think their singu-
lar vote is inconsequential, and yet,
if you add each of these singular
votes together, they make a differ-
ence. It has never been more crucial
that everyone that has a voice to be
heard is informed when going into
that booth on Election Day.
Energy reform is not a
political matter
TO THE DAILY:
It's once again voting season here
at the University.
In a political landscape that's
increasingly and alarmingly
steeped in bitter and petty parti-
sanship, obvious by the hundreds of
negative campaign ads, there's one
issue that everyone should be work-
ing together on: clean energy.

However, as we have all been
consumed with midterms of our
own in the past few weeks, for busy
students, elections and politics
are often put on the furthest back
burners available. Therefore, the
NAACP and the American Civil
Liberties Union Undergrad Chapter
are hosting a "Voter Empowerment
Seminar" Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in the
Pendleton Room of the Union in
order to foster a more politically
aware climate on campus, and to
inform students of the oft-forgotten
influence of local and state politics
on our lives.
The Voter Empowerment Semi-
nar is a non-partisan event that will
encourage students at the Univer-
sity to vote Nov. 4 by introducing
them to candidates, their platforms
and why in general, it's important
to vote. Student organizations will
also have a voice in the event, pre-
senting the speakers and focus-
ing on the importance of students
either filling out their absentee bal-
lots or making it out to the polling
place on Election Day.
In terms of speakers, we will
have a wide variety, including
ACLU Attorney Michael Steinberg,
who will speak about restrictions
to voting and the problems with
Supreme Court elections in the
past. Our lineup, coming from
both Republican and Democratic
parties, will be given a few minutes
each to describe their initiatives if
elected, and demonstrate why it's
so important for students to get
out and vote Nov. 4. The confirmed
candidates are:
Lisa Brown, Democratic
candidate for Lieutenant Governor
Richard Bernstein, Candidate for
Michigan Supreme Court

Susan Baskett and Patricia
Manley, Candidates for Ann Arbor
School Board
Attorney Veronique Liem,
Candidate for Circuit Court Judge
Chair Yousef Rabhi, Washt-
enaw Board of Commissioners -
District 8
Tracy Van den Berg, Candidate
for Washtenaw County Probate
At the very end of the event,
students will have the opportunity
to engage directly with candidates
and ask questions in person. We
hope that familiarizing students
with candidates will make them
feel more connected to the political
process that many have just
experienced in a classroom setting.
This event will be largely
academic, because the candidates
will be addressing issues on
their platform that are relevant
to students today. Students will
not only listen to the candidates
lecture, but will also engage in
the learning process actively by
asking questions and personally
interacting with candidates and
other student organizations. Some
of the topics that may be covered
in the event include gun control,
health care, education, minimum
wage, women's rights, environment
and any others that voters would be
interested inlearningabout directly
from the candidates themselves.
At the end of the day, the most
fundamental component of our
lives is our freedom to voice our
opinions. If we choose not to voice
them when it matters the most,
then what's the purpose of having
one at all?

And indeed the miners only seem

myths and misconceptions.
But the truth that both parties
recognize - and from which they
derive their united virtuosity
and strength - is that they are
essentially one and the same
and therefore ought to support
one another. Reciprocity is nice,
but the reason to do something
good - the reason the gays and
lesbians decide to support the
miners, for example - is not
because the miners have or will
specifically support the gays and

one and therefore already all help
and support one another. That
is the takeaway of this film, and
what makes "Pride" incredibly
beautiful and inspiring to watch.

with With a Little Help from My
Fwends, of course - The Flaming
Lips' reboot (and drastic revision)
oftheFabFour's 1967effervescent

Band.
Lead singer Wayne Coyne
and the gang bring a slew of
noteworthy artists (Miley Cyrus,
Foxygen, Dr. Dog and electro-
aficionado Moby, to name a few)
along for the ride, forming quite
a compilation of lonely hearts.
Together, they plunge into the
abyss of hippy nowhere land. "We
hope you will enjoy the show,"
they sing. There's a lot of hope in
that sentence.
As for the album?Not exactly -
in this 51-minute clunker, Beatles
classics are unintentionally
lampooned and drenched in lava

lamp juice. The premiere example
of this is the titular track, "With
a Little Help from My Friends,"
which is arguably one of the most
sing-song-y of Ringo tunes. In
its original state, it's peaceful,
content; in its Flaming state, it's
a conglomeration of pixie noises,
intense drum outbursts from
outer space and screaming vocal
responsesto the verse's questions.
It's the farthest thing from
settling.
"When I'm Sixty-Four" follows
suit with no clear beat to it and
no drum accompaniment. As
fun and innovative as it is to
hear psychedelic covers of songs,
meandering tracks like this one
make the listening experience
completely boring. Structure is
desperately lacking. "Being For
the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" is also
shockingly scatter-brained, with
sharp pangs of piano banging and
maniacal laughter thrown into
the colorful mix. Already a crazy
song, this one didn't need much
Lip-a-fying to begin with.
Due to the help from their
"fwends," it was actually hard
to hear The Flaming.Lips on:
many of the trippy tunes. Wayne
Coyne's voice was drowned out
by Birdflower and Morgan Delt on
GeorgeHarrison'sclassic"Within
You Without You," a track that
could've used a slight homage
to the original sitar-laced ode.
Coyne'svoice is cooing and coolly
nasally, and when he does power
through the excess, he reminds
the listener of Lennon and
Harrison. With a Little Helpfrom
MyFwendscould've usedmore of
that.
There are songs, however,
that shine. "Getting Better" and
"Lovely Rita," both perfectly
pleasant tunes, took a much

milder trip with the Lips.
They're funky, vibrant grooves
with guitar, drums and a solid
foundation - covers done
correctly. It's an immense relief
for the ears.
But, alas, all that is good
is fleeting, and the listener
is catapulted back into the
futuristic trip time and again.
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
is frightening. This is the one
with Hann - uh, Miley Cyrus,
sounding more un-Disney than
usual, which is nice. The verses
are innocent enough. But when
the chorus drops, it's this huge,
robots-crushing-buildings,
techno-glitter apocalypse. The
crescendo between the two
parts is commendable, but the
contrast may be a little too
drastic. Lennon's awesome
chorus harmonies are traded in
for explosive pixie diarrhea.
"Fixing a Hole" and "She's
Leaving Home" go unnoticed in
the grand scheme of psychedelia
- they don't differ much from
the others. "Good Morning
Good Morning" is irksome, as
well. Both "Sgt: Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band" and its reprise
are long and distorted, though
the reprise flourishes in its
melodic, traditional nature.
And then there's "A Day in the
Life," widely considered to be The
Beatles' best song. The Flaming
Lips must love their irony - this
is the least unconventional out
of all the covers. It's structured,
shortened and missing the famous
trippy, hysterical interlude found
in the middle of the original.
That's okay, though - the rest of
their album makes up for it.
A good effort, Lips. The album's
got good, tie-dye intentions, but
you don't messwith the best.

'The 100' becomes '48'

Sam Hunt's pop misstep

'Montevallo' pushes
country boundaries
in wrong direction
By GREGORY HICKS
DailyArts Writer
For those who thought "Cruise,"
"That's My Kinda Night" and "We
Are Never Ever Getting Back
Together"
were pushing
the boundar-
ies of what Montevallo
could reason-
ably be called Sam Hunt
a country song,
prepare to MCA Nashville
be mortified.
There's a new hot commodity in
Nashville, and he's been shop-
ping in the clearance section at
PacSun.
Sam Hunt has spent the past
year teasing his massive fanbase
with tracks fromhis debut record,
Montevallo, and now the time has
come for said fans to push Hunt
to the top. Now if only the singer
were being pushed into the prop-
er musical category.
Just because male country
has taken a turn for the pop and
hip hop doesn't mean that there
isn't a line to be crossed. Light-
acoustic rhythm guitar and the

world's faintest steel guitar aren't
compensation for a tsunami of
hip-hop beats and synth drops on
"Break Up in a Small Town," "Ex
To See" and "Make You Miss Me."
While it's true that other coun-
try stars are utilizing the same
pop and hip-hop overtones, their
synth and beat usage isn't nearly
as thick, and they have the vocal
twangs to stay glued to their genre
- thinking of a nasally Thomas
Rhett belting over a synthetically
finessed "Get Me Some of That."
Hunt's vocals aren't a supportive
foundation to build over, given
their lack of distinct inflections,
and it causes the singer to channel
a West Coast flow, rather than a
down-South chime.
Even Hunt's lead single "Leave
the Night On" was given the
cold shoulder by from coun-
try radio (comparative to sales)
until recently, for the same lack-
of-country reasons. The track
was also messy in its engineer-
ing, much like the record's other
tracks that sport demo-quality
vocal production, with pitch
correction so sloppy that only
AM radio could cover it up. This
becomes particularly sloppy in
Montevallo's ballad sections.
Ballad-writing is Hunt's
A-game. The singer-songwriter
made a name for himself through
ballad work, having written

1

Kenny Chesney's platinum hit
"Come Over" as well as Keith
Urban's "Cop Car," so it's unsur-
prising that the singer delivers
an intensely heartfelt rendition of
"Cop Car" himself. Unfortunate-
ly, it's a rather spiteful rendition
beneath the surface. The singer
cryptically nagged on Twitter
about Keith Urban'sversion of the
hit song, stating that it wasn'thow
he envisioned the track when he
was writing it. Hunt has quite the
audacity to slam Urban and follow
up by rerecording the track.
Frankly, Hunt also has quite
the audacity in general for fight-
ing every common thread of the
genre. If the image, lyricism and
instrumentation don't leave the
people with anything country,
what's left? There's a little thing
called "balance" when it comes to
satisfying a genre, and Hunt is not
one for makingattemptsto achieve
that. Montevallo has a slight coun-
try lean at best - which explains
why Hunt's demographic is almost
entirely college girls who haven't
dabbled in country since pick-
ing up Gretchen Wilson's second
album from a bargain bin at the
local carwash. It's not uncommon
for an up-and-comer with an enor-
mous fanbase to bebold, but don't
cross the line for a debut record.

In its first season, The CW's
post-apocalyptic drama "The 100"
overcame a lackluster start, filled

taining and,
at times, dark
look at surviv-
ing in a primi-

Season Two
Premiere
Wednesdays
at 9 p.m.
The CW

Mount Weather, a military facil-
ity now serving as a closed-off
society run by Dante Wallace
(Raymond J. Barry, "Justified").
The Mount Weather group and
facility is presented as a com-
pletely different world from the
almost primal Earth; it's a soci-
ety that is modern but oddly anti-
quated, like something out of a
"Fallout" game. Wallace presents
himself as an ambivalent friend,
but as in most of these scenarios,
Clarke voices that Mount Weath-
er is "too good to be true." The
fact that the new group is unable
to survive outside dueto the radi-
ation to which Clarke and the
rest of the members of the Ark
are immune presents a provoca-
tive moral dilemma for the shows
heroine who longs to escape.
What is Clarke willing to do to
escape and survive, and does that
extend to causing the deaths of
an entire group of people?
Outside, other cast mem-
bers struggle to stay alive. Star-
crossed lovers Octavia (Marie
Avgeropoulos, "Cult") and Lin-
coln (Ricky Whittle, "Mistress-
es") try to heal Octavia's wound
sustained during last season's
final battle. Last season began
to hint at a much deeper culture
and social organization behind
the Grounders, people who
inhabited Earth, immune from
radiation. This plotline looks to
further explore thisgroup as Lin-
coln, a Grounder himself, takes
Octavia to his village. Throwing

snippets of an original language
and traditions will hopefullylead
to forming a complete picture of
the last season's largely antago-
nistic group.
Finally, Bellamy (Bob Mor-
ley, "Neighbours") and Finn
(Thomas McDonell, "Prom") are
reunited with the adults from the
crash-landed Ark led by Coun-
cillor Kane (Henry Ian Cusick,
"Lost"). The black-and-white
outlook and rules of the Ark
instantly clash with the morally
grey reality of survival on Earth
to which Bellamy and Finn have
grown accustomed. Issues like
what to do with last season's
troubled John Murphy (Richard
Harmon, "Bates Motel") promise
conflict that will test the ideals
of the two groups. The parallels
established last season between
the old world and new are set
to collide as the old leadership
clashes with the young survivors.
The ambition is evident in the
beginnings of this second season.
Each storyline promises to look
at aspects of survival and soci-
etal construction. But there are
possible pitfalls that can derail
each storyline and the chance the
series becomes spread too thin.
Giving the necessary time and
development to each story will be
the key for "The 100" going for-
ward, and if itsucceeds, may result
in not just an entertaining look
into a post-nuclear-apocalyptic
world but a mature and intriguing
drama about human survival.

show's two settings - a wild
Earth, where the titular group
of teenagers were sent, and the
dying space station The Ark,
where their parents resided
- explored the difficulties of
establishing a society and pre-
serving a dying one. The season
two premiere, "The 48," brings
these two worlds together while
also expanding the setting of the
post-apocalyptic Earth.
"The 48" finds the main cast

MEN'S SOCCER
Arnone leads 'M'
on and off field

Florie gets chance to shine

By SYED FAHD AHSAN
For the Daily
Last week, a media committee
announced the 10-man list for
the men's soccer Senior CLASS
Award, which recognizes well-
rounded student-athletes.
It should come as little surprise
then that Michigan's two-
time captain, fifth-year senior
midfielder Tylor Arnone was on
the list of finalists.
"When I heard I was named a
finalist for the Senior Class Award
I felt very honored." Arnone said
in an email interview. "Being the
best person I can be every day
is something that I consistently
think about."
As far as his achievements on
the pitch are concerned, Arnone
has pretty much swept the indi-
vidual awards available to him
in his four years playing for the
Wolverines. He was named to the
All-Big Ten first team in 2012 and
2013 while making the Big Ten
All-Freshman team in 2011. He
was voted the Big Ten Midfielder
of the year in 2013 as well.
Having seen the team win
its only Big Ten championship
while he was redshirted, Arnone
has since notched a total of nine
goals and 14 assists in 72 games.
These modest statistics don't fully
encapsulate Arnone's importance
to the squad. In many ways, he is
to Michigan what Michael Brad-
ley is to the U.S. National Team
- an attacking midfielder more
concerned with dictating the pace
of play rather than making the
highlight real. He is in essence,
the maestro on the pitch, the most
important player on the team.
His importance was high-
lighted in the 3-1 loss to Indiana
on Sunday, a game that Arnone
missed because of an injury. The
Wolverines looked likea different
team whenin possession of the
ball and struggled to assert their
style of play on the game without
their captain. They hope to have
himback assoonas possible,ifnot
against Oakland on Wednesday,
then at least their last two crucial
Big Ten fixtures against rivals

Michigan State and Ohio State.
Arnone though, considers this
achievement one for the entire
team rather than just for himself.
"In my opinion this award
never gets awarded to just one
individual." Arnone said. "In my
case, I'd have to recognize all the
support I receive both academi-
cally and athletically here' at the
University of Michigan."
But what really sets this award
apart from the ones Arnone has
already amassed, is what it means
for his family.
"My nomination is also a
reflection of my family." Arnone
said. "I come from a humble
background and with my mom
being a single parent, things were
never easy or given to us. But my
mom is an amazing woman and
has helped shape me to become
the man I am today and I love
making her proud."
As important as his presence
is on the pitch, Arnone is just as
valuable around campus. He has
volunteered at many different
organizations throughouthistime
at the University, most notably
visiting patients at the C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, participating
in "U-Meet the Athlete" and
volunteering at the Army vs. Navy
wheelchair basketball game, to
name a few.
Perhaps one of the most
memorable things he did was give
two long-time Manchester United
fans, both 60 years his senior, the
chance to see their beloved club
face off against Real Madrid at the
Big House in August.
As far as academics are con-
cerned, Arnone is a physical edu-
cation major, and in 2013 he made
the Academic All-Big Ten and
won the Big Ten Distinguished
Scholar award as well. The same
year, he was named as the Michi-
gan Association for Health, Physi-
cal Education, Recreation and
Dance Student of the Year.
If Arnone is indeed able to
come away with the award come
December, it would be an amal-
gamation of his hard work and
dedication toward his career as a
student-athlete at the University.

Daily Sports Writer
For someone who just started
running three years ago, redshirt
freshman Corinne Florie is ahead
of the curve.
After not competing last year,
Florie has been racing with the
traveling squad this season. She
was the ninth Wolverine across
the line at the Big Ten Preview on
Sept. 20 and took fourth overall
in the Pre-Nationals open race on
Oct.18. These performances gave
Florie just the edge she needed to
be selected to race at the Big Ten
Championships this Sunday.
This resume would be impres-
sive for any runner, let alone one
who made the switch to competi-
tive running a few years ago.
Florie played basketball year-
round for her first two years of
high school. But in the spring of
her sophomore year, she wanted
a change of pace. After a friend
from basketball suggested she try
cross country, Florie decided to
give itatry, figuringshewouldn't
have the skill set necessary to
compete in another sport.
Since she was only accustomed
to the sprinting on the basketball
court, Florie began running
longer distances over the summer
to build up the endurance she'd
need for cross country. But Florie
didn't time herself, so when she
began running with the team in
the fall of 2011, she was in for a
pleasant surprise.
Despite the fact that she'd only
started running any real distance
that summer, natural talent and
rigorous training with the team
quickly led Florie to the front
of her high school pack. By the
end of her first season, she was
on the squad racing at the New
York state championships - an
impressive feat for anyone, let
alone a junior who had only been
running for a few months.
"Making it to the state meet
my first year on the team was
definitely a highlight," she said.
"Before I started running, I
didn't think about it. But once I
started running with the team
and racing, I started to get the
idea that I might be able to go
somewhere with (cross country)."
Her senior year in high school

was even more impressive. In
addition to captaining both the
cross country and track teams,
Florie set five high school records,
won many of her races and quali-
fied for the state meet again.
Amidst all her racing, Florie
had to make time for college vis-
its. Michigan was always on the
list, among other Big Ten schools.
Both Florie and her father were
already steadfast Wolverine
fans, but her recruitment visit to
Ann Arbor was what ultimately
helped her decide.
"I was a little uncertain about
coming to Michigan because the
team was so good and Michigan
is so academically challenging,"
Florie said. "But when I got on
campus, seeing all the block 'M's'
and maize, I instinctivelyfeltlike
it was the right place for me. It
was kind of likea dream."
During her freshman year,
Florie was redshirted by design
and raced unattached just
twice. She spent her first season
adjusting to various aspects of
collegiate-level cross country,
the biggest difference being the
transition from running as an
individual to being partof a team.
In high school, it's easy to get
caught up in your own race and
focus on beating personal bests
rather than the team's overall

score. When you're running for
a collegiate team, though, that
has to change. Having a team
mentality rather than an indi-
vidual one is critical to the team
dynamic. Focusing on helping
each other through workouts
and races is partially how Michi-
gan has become a strong team.
Florie has also had to adapt to
the fact that the collegiate field is
a lot deeper. Winning - or even
making the top 10 - is not as easy
as it was in high school.
"In was pretty common in
high school for everyoneto sprint
at the beginning, to just run their
own race," Florie said. "You just
knew to take the lead and go. But
in college, people know how to
pace themselves a little bit more
intelligently."
In addition to building up her
collegiate racing resume, Florie
has spent the season honing her
racing motivation. In addition to
the simple desire to work hard
and improve, her drive stems
from a positive mentality.
"If I'm working hard and
doing the best I can, I focus on
that rather than one specific
goal," she said, "like getting into
the Big Ten Championships. It
feels more positive that way."
That technique - putting in
the hard work and "trusting that

the results willfollow"-is paying
off. Many of her teammates are
training at the same level, so
when it came time to decide who
would race on Sunday, it was a
close call. Florie's fourth-place
finish at Pre-Nationals was just
the extra push needed to get her
on Sunday's squad.
"Corinne's been steady all sea-
son and we are excited about the
opportunity for her to compete
in her first Big Ten Cross Coun-
try Championship," said Michi-
gan coach Mike McGuire. "She's
going to give us great effort, and
I think this weekend will serve
as a launching pad for bigger and
better things for her over the
course of the next three years."
The season is looking good
for Florie, but true to what she
said about being grateful for
where she is, she sticks to being
appreciative of the moment.
"I don't know what's going to
happen in the next five minutes,
let alone the next year," she said
with a smile and a shrug. "So I
just focus on my training now
and I'll see where it takes me."
For now, Florie will continue
to focus on the here and now,
taking in her experiences during
her time as a runner at Michigan
and trusting her training to take
her to places she dares to dream.

For theDaily
Any loss hurts, but for the
Michigan field hockey team,
a 1-0 loss to Iowa in last year's
Big Ten tournament was
more devastating than most.
The affair ended a season of
underperformance for the
Wolverines, as they finished
12-8 overall and were left out of
the NCAA Tournament for the
first time since 2009.
"I was in shock" said fifth-
year senior midfielder Lauren
Hauge. "The longer and longer
I sat (thinking about missing
the tournament) I got mad."
And the omission was not
taken lightly by Hauge and
fellow seniors, back Leslie
Smith, midfielder Ainsley
McCallister, midfielder
Sammy Gray and forward Emy
Guttman. Four of the five were
on the team in 2010, though
they were redshirted the last
time field hockey won the Big
Ten tournament. Falling from a
championship-level program to
a middle-of-the-pack team over
three years isn't the way this
group wanted to go out, and it
has fueled them this year.
But before games even
started in late August, the
Wolverines had to overcome
their fair share of adversity.
Junior midfielder Caroline
Chromik had to undergo knee
surgery after an injury in spring
practice. Delayed renovations
to Ocker Field left the team
without a home, and it had to
take its summer practices on
the road.
It was on a team trip to
Virginia Beach, Virginia at
the beginning of preseason
that Smith noticed something
special about the group of
women assembled. After a day
of travel frustrations, Smith

thought the team would arrive
at its opening practice in bad
spirits unwilling to go through
its annual runningtest. Shewas
wrong.
"We're all tired, but we were
like, 'screw it,' we're going to
go out there with smiles on our
faces and absolutely kill this
(running) test," Smith said.
"From that moment, I thought
if our team could overcome
these setbacks on the very first
day, I think we can overcome a
lot."
That attitude has been
the driving force behind the
Wolverines running right
into what has been a special
season so far. After starting
0-2, Michigan rebounded with
six straight
victories
- the most
impressive "The]

State on the

"We were
down 2-0 at
halftime, and
all of us had to believe that we
could back and win," Gray said.
"It was a moment of everyone
buying in to all our hard work
and preparations. And (it)
would really set the tone (for
upcoming games)."
The Wolverines currently
sit 11-6 overall, a record that
in large part is due to the
goal-scoring efforts of the
senior class. They've scored
20 of Michigan's 44 goals on
the season with McCallister
leading the Big Ten with 17
assists.
"We have the experience
to step up in high-pressure
situations," McCallister said.
"Being able to play intensely

and stay levelheaded is
something (us seniors) have
gained confidence in."
All the seniors agree they
all respectively bring different
personalities to the field, which
has been the formula for success
thus far. While they may not all
agree the bond between the
five of them is anything special,
Guttman, the only true senior,
says the bond extends to the
entire team.
"My class went from seven
to two. (The fifth-year seniors)
havemadememoreoftheirclass
because mine has dwindled so
much," Guttman said. "Overall,
they have made our whole team
become super close this year.
Our team chemistry is really
good and that
can be seen
on the field."

. player is
convinced
that the team
will make up
for last year's setbacks. A deep
run in both the Big Ten and
NCAA tournaments is not only
a goal, but a belief.
Hauge is driven to make an
addition to a prize from her
freshman year. On herring from
the 2010 Big Ten championship,
Hauge had "Those Who Stay"
inscribed inside. Ever since
receiving the ring, she has
dreamt of being able to add the
phrase "Will Be Champions"
below it after winning another
championship.
"I didn'tget(a championship)
last year," Hauge said. "So
I came back because I'm
convinced we'll have that
opportunity this year."

Wolverines hope

M' prepares for Coleman

By DANNY VARGOVICK
Daily Sports Writer
Some days, you just don't have

it.
The Michigan men's golf
team didn't have it Monday, or
Tuesday. It finished 10th out of
12 with a score of 59-over par at
the Royal Oaks Intercollegiate
in Dallas, the Wolverines' final
tournament of the fall schedule.
Oklahoma State won the
event with a score of 15-over par,
as Baylor senior Mikkel Bjerch-
Andresen took home first-place
individual honors with a score
of six-under par.
K Freshman Kyle Mueller paced
the Wolverines at nine-over par,
finishing tied for 24th.
"Kyle really played a solid
event again," said Michigan
coach Chris Whitten. "I know
there's a couple swings he
would like to have back, but he
really earned the respect of his
teammates through his play in
the fall season."
Senior Noori Hyun, junior
Chris O'Neill and junior Brett
McIntosh all finished tied-44th
with scores of 13-over par. It
was Hyun's first start of the year
as a result of the tournament's
6-count-5 players format instead
of the usual 5-count-4.
Because this team is one of
the deepest Whitten has had, it
wasn't surprising to see a player
not normally in the starting
lineup come in and execute.
Unfortunately for Hyun, his
opportunity didn't come at the
best of times - his next potential
start won't come until February.
Still, Whitten was nonetheless
impressed.
"I know Noori is able to play
at a really high level," Whitten
said. "He showed flashes of that
this week."
Hyun's tournament was cause
for celebration. But O'Neill's
performance was cause for
concern, as the team's leading
scorer from each of the past two
years has dropped off his pace.


"I know that Chris is a really
competitive person," Whitten
said. "We really try to get them
not to think about their score
or their finish as much as the
process, and how they're going
about managing the purse and
playing each shot one at a time.
I'm sure as he looks back, he'll
feel like he has some unfinished
business."
O'Neill has been slowed by
nagging injuries all fall. Injuries
combined with some technique
issues have forced him to try to
get the most that he can out of
a golf swing that neither he nor
Whitten has been satisfied with.
Still, Whitten said that he
thought O'Neill struck the ball
about as well as he has all fall at
this tournament and affirmed
that his leading scorer over the
past two years is "a really good
player (who) often plays some of
his best golf in the spring."
Sophomore Bryce Evon
finished just one stroke behind
Hyun, O'Neill and McIntosh at
14-over par. Sophomore Reed
Hrynewich rounded out the
Wolverine squad with a score of
17-over par.
The conditions in Dallas
on Monday and Tuesday were
unlike anything the team has
seen thus far this season. The
golf course was especially firm;
and strong winds pervaded the
first day in rounds one and two.
Many of the opposing schools
were from the surrounding area,
so the conditions were more
familiar to them.
Despite not seeing the
outcome that he wanted,
Whitten remained upbeat.
"On the scoreboard, not has
high as we wanted to finish, but
there were definitely some good
things from the guys," Whitten
said. "I think they feel like
they're a little bit behind where
they'd like to be, but at the same
time I think they know that they
can get right back into position.
I think they're really hungry to
prove what they can do."

Often in football, an offens e
player's statistics read like a
video game. But that wouldn't
be an apt description for thcse
of Indiana running back Texin
Coleman. His statistics from
this season are reminiscent
of a kid teaching his younger
brother a video game for the
first time and then beating the
pulp out of him.
Through seven games,
Coleman has rushed for 1,1)2
yards and 11 touchdowns. He
has surpassed 100 yards rushing
in every game and scampered
for more than 200 yards twice.
And Coleman's 170.3 rushing
yards per game leads the nation.
He's a constant big-play
threat and has had a run of t
least 40 yards in each of the
Hoosiers' games.
Coleman's unique talent
poses a formidable threat to
Michigan on Saturday. The
Wolverines have struggled at
times this season against the
Big Ten's top running backs.
Michigan State's Jeremy
Langford scorched Michigan
for 177 yards and three
touchdowns last weekend ard
Minnesota's David Cobb fared
similarly on Sept. 27, blistering
the Wolverines for 183 rushing
yards.
"I think it was a combination
of not getting off blocks,
maybe not being as physical
as we thought we could
be," said Michigan redshirt
sophomore defensive lineman
Chris Wormley of last week's
performance. "Just an overall
D-line problem, I guess."
In the week to rectify the
Wolverines' defensive issues,
Wormley said he was noticed
an uptick in the physicality of
practice. Monday, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke said he'd
consider structural changes to
the way the team practiced in
order to increase productivity
on game day.
Perhaps a strategic shift in
Hoke's practice methodology,
Wormley said he thought the

If the defensive line fails to
contain Coleman, the rest of the
Wolverines' defense could be in
trouble. Michigan has keyed on
avoiding the big plays Coleman
has a penchant for making.
"When he gets out in space,
he can definitely break it out,"
Ryan said. "He's also good in
holes. ... That's one thing we
need to stop this week."
Stopping Coleman would
go a long way toward stifling
the Hoosier offense. The
Wolverines' defense knows
that.
Ryan said he isn't worried
about goals, bowls or any of the
other things that have plagued
Michigan this season. Coleman
is plenty to worry about.
"It's just all about Indiana
right now," Ryan said. "Indiana,
Indiana, Indiana."

8B Wednesday October 29 20 The Statement

STEM
From Page 5B

Research done by the US Air Force con-
cluded undergraduate females with a larger
proportion of female STEM teachers are
more likely to declare STEM majors. Of
the 157 tenured and tenure-track profes-
sors listed in the Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science faculty page, less than 14
percent are female.
"It's true we need more women on our
faculty, we also need more minorities, and
really there are not enough in the pipeline
in terms of enough graduating with Ph.D.s
in engineering, which makes it challenging
for us to build," Munson said. "We can't tell
departments who to hire, but we do approve
the pool from which they choose, which
lets us ensure it's not just a list of Caucasian
males."
The dwindling numbers
Abigail Stewart, a psychology and wom-
en's studies professor, currently serves as
the founding director of U-M ADVANCE -
a University program designed to improve
campus environments for faculty members,
particularly women and minorities. Accord-
ing to her, recruitment is only half the battle.
"ADVANCE, over the past 12 years has
coordinated with many faculty depart-
ments, including physics and engineering,
when it comes to hiring a diverse field of
candidates," she said. "But part of it is also
making sure that. after we hire them. they

aren't being discounted."
"In order to ensure that doesn't happen,"
Stewart said. "We conduct periodical cli-
mate studies,goingto different departments
and evaluating whether or not there's a
healthy work environment in place. Because
a lot of the times, for graduate faculty and
postdocs, this is their world."
"They're not all over campus doing all
these different things," she continued.
"They're in one space most of the time, and
so if that one space is confining or demoral-
izing, it can be extremely detrimental."
In the meantime, the imbalance contin-
ues to create work and classroom atmo-
spheres that may not be outwardly hostile,
but are tilted in favor of the dominant
majority. Hochster described multiple stud-
ies carried out over the last decade which
highlight obvious examples of engendered
sexism appearing in everyday contexts.
One of those studies, also cited in Pol-
lack's article, pointed to work done by Yale
researchers who quantifiably concluded
that women in STEM fields with the same
qualification as their male counterparts are
less likely to be offered the same job. And if
they did get the job, they would - on aver-
age - collect $4,000 less in annual pay.
This creates a cyclic nature of depre-_
ciation in the classroom that Davis, as the
director for WISE, feels needs to be com-
bated while tangible efforts are made to
make classrooms more renresentative of the

population.
"A critical mass of any group within
a larger setting is important in terms of
climate, so small numbers of women in a
classroom can lead to a feeling of margin-
alization," Davis said. "As the numbers
increase there is a qualitative difference in
terms of comfort levels and contributions."
Carrie Schoeneberger, an Engineering
senior and SWE's external vice president,
described her experience interning at a
nuclear power plant over the summer.
"I was put into a systems engineering
group and almost everyone was male, but I
feel like I was able to adapt to it," she said.
"No one was openly being discouraging or
anything but you pick up on little things -
like people (censoring) jokes so they don't
'offend the woman.' "
Engineering senior Lauren Reeves, presi-
dent of Michigan's chapter of the National
Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), added
that the biased treatment becomes more
visible when faced by women of color.
"A lot of times in my classes if we're
breaking into groups, I'llnotice that it's usu-
ally just other people of color who approach
me to work with them," she said. "Which
furthers the sort of negative, unwelcoming
attitude alot of people don't even have to
think about."
"And because there are so few of us, the
problem feels even more magnified," Reeves
said.
Through NSBE,Reeves
and other members try to
create a close-knit fam-
ily that can offer new
students the outlets they
may need to express
concerns and seek guid-
ance. Though with an
ever-diminishing body of
Black student engineers,
the situation presents a
catch-22.
"Our membership
depends completely on
how many Black stu-
dents are accepted by
the College of Engineer-
ing," Reeves said. "So the
smaller that number is,
the harder it is for us to
create a strong commu-
nity for the people who
are here."
A ticking clock
So why are we talking
about this now?
According to McKay
and Munson, many of
these issues have been
brewing behind the
scenes for decades.
Though departments
across the country have

been trying to address the daunting task
for years, recently, the discussion has been
pulled to the forefront in a highly transpar-
ent, social-media-centric world.
"What's encouraging, though, are the
most recent results of the check-ins we do
every five years across campus to gauge
whether or not we're addressing the prob-
lems," Stewart said. "In the first one we did,
from 2001 to 2006, we got a pretty regular
spread, but from 2006 to 2012,,there's been
this huge, positive upswing in dialogues
about these topics."
"Part of that is transparency," Stewart
added. "Though I'm convinced more has
to do with just a general willingness to hit
these problems head-on, which is inspiring."
Still, concrete explanations for seemingly
random dips in representation - like the one
experienced across most STEM fields over
the last decade - are few and far between.
One possible answer has to do with the
economy.
Curiously, the slowdown of women's rep-
resentation in the STEM workforce early in
the 21st century coincides with upticks in
national employment figures. When those
employment percentages fell in 2008, after
the housing and credit meltdown, women
turned back to science coursework.
Mapped in yearly demographic reports
by the National Science Foundation, strong
upward trends in the representation of
women in STEM occupations between 1997
and 2003 were followed by years of a slow,
plateauing decline. But after 2007, there was
an acceleration, likely due to a larger portion
of female undergraduates seeking degrees
that offered more job security in the midst of
a tenuous economic crisis. Even so, the pro-
gression is more dire when limiting our view
to computer science, where - unlike any
other subsection of STEM - representation
has fallen since the early 1990s, showing no
signs of slowing the decline after 2007.
"I think this holds true for a lot of minori-
ties going after the sciences," Munson said.
"The job security these majors offer has
always been a great pull, so the economy
is definitely a factor, but we hope the trend
continues."
"It's worth noting that these pressures
from the economy also means they're more
anxious about whether or not they want
to go after those careers - go after those
careers as women," Stewart said. " 'Is this
really somethingI want to devote the rest of
my life to?''Will I be viewed differently in
society, as less of a woman, if I do?'"
The explanations-for why representation
slowed when the economy soared are more
difficult to come by, but can provide insight
into avoiding similar dips in the future.
Some lines of reasoning cite societal pres-
sures on females to move away from bread-
winner roles, especially at times when the
traditionally male-dominated economy isn't
sputtering.

Personal Statement: My favorite word
by Mayank Mathur

ann arbor affairs: second time's the charm
BY DANIELLE RAYKHINSHTEYN

The first time a boy
ever seriously told me
he loved me, it was
January of my fresh-
man year and I was sitting in my
dorm room in Alice Lloyd. We
were not dating at the time, so
you can see how this would come
as quite a shock.
I do not believe in love at first
sight, but I do believe in fate at
first site, and that was what
happened with this boy at a
party during syllabus week my
freshman year. He was blackout
drunk and, admittedly, not the
most attractive person I'd ever
seen, but I was somehow drawn
to him. I knew this would be
something.
We started hanging out a
couple days a week, and eventu-
ally it grew into a relationship.
We were official for about three
days before he broke it off. This
was directly after Fall Break.
A few days later, he begged for
me back, and I accepted (stu-
pidly). We were engaged in an
emotionally volatile relation-
ship until after Christmas, upon
which time he broke up with me
(again). Here is where we find
ourselves rather confused on
Observatory Street.
After much deliberation, I
reluctantly agreed to get back
together with him (AGAIN),
because I would never be able to
forgive myself if I didn't at least

see what a relation-
ship would be like
with a boy who
loved me.
He broke up with
me in April.
This boy grew up
in an upper-mid-
dle class suburb of
Detroit, with two
loving parents and
two siblings with
whom he was very
close. He lived a
fairly normal child-
hood. In my head, I
compared this with
my own childhood:
dealing with an abu-
sive father, conse-
quently being raised
by a single mom and constantly
moving to new cities depend-
ing on who my mother or father
married. I didn't understand
how I could still believe in love
at all; but, even more than that,
I didn't understand how the boy
was the one who couldn't handle
a serious relationship out of the
two of us.
The second time a boy ever
seriously told me he loved me
was Welcome Week this - my
junior - year, in the bathroom
of a house I was living on the
couch of. He also didn't realize
he had said it. You can see how
this would also come as quite a
shock.
This boy and I also experi-
enced some kind of fate
at first sight, when I met
him sophomore year
right before Thanks-
giving, after being
invited to his apart-
ment to play a drunken
round of Cards Against
Humanity by a mutual
friend. We became
friends quickly, texting
around the clock and
seeing each other quite
often, and at the start
of winter semester, we
made our relationship
official.
In August I told him
I loved him.
He didn't say it
back, but I didn't say
it to hear it back - to

be validated. I said it simply
because I wanted him to know
that someone loved him, want-
ed him to know that I would be
there no matter what. He didn't
say it back, but he also didn't run,
and that was all that mattered to
me. We.had a conversation about
it, and he said he just wasn't
ready, so I waited.
This boy grew up not hav-
ing much money in Illinois. His
parents had him while they were
still in high school. He has to pay
for his own out-of-state tuition.
I always thought I wanted
to date someone "normal" -
someone who grew up with the
kind of childhood I want for my
kids: pleasant, normal, with a
loving family in one place, but
it is through these relation-
ships that I realized it is often
the most "normal" people who
are the most unstable. Without
the hardships of childhood, you
don't know how to deal with the
hardships adulthood brings. I've
realized it's not the normality I
want for my children, but the
love that is so often associated
with it.
This boy and I have now
become that couple in some
respects: on a recent grocery
shopping trip, we both unknow-
ingly bought a bag of Swedish
Fish for the other. As he hugged
me in the aisle, I thought to
myself how lucky I was to be
loved by someone "abnormal;"
how delicious it truly is.

at is your favorite
word?"
This is one of the
many questions that James Lip-
ton asks his guests on "Inside the
Actors Studio" as part of a stan-
dard questionnaire at the end of
the show. After years of being a film
and television enthusiast, I've got-
ten into the habit of trying to put
myself in the shoes of an interview-
ee. Whenever I watch an interview
with an actor or another famous
personality, I always end up try-
ing to answer the questions they're
posed, regardless of the level of my
knowledge on the subject being dis-
cussed. What's interesting is that I
usually change my answers for all
questions when I watch a new epi-
sode of "Inside the Actors Studio,"
except for the one I just mentioned.
I love the word "creative." I love
the crisp sound of the first syl-
lable and how it seems to mellow
down, almost wandering away into
ambiguity by the time you finish
saying it. It's a small word, which
is good because I'm not particu-
larly fond of long, overly intelligent
sounding words. Using them usu-
ally indicates an overzealousness to
appease.
See what I mean?
It's absurd that I feel a little
proud every time I reaffirm my
choice while watching the show.
What's even more curious is that,

until recently, this seemingly base-
less sense of pride had always been
accompanied by some confusion.
What does "creative" even mean?
And why is it my favorite word?
Most of the time, I find it diffi-
cult to explain the meaning behind
words. I may know how to use a
word and what it means in differ-
ent contexts, but if you were to ask
me to define the word as a diction-
ary would, I'd be stumped. It's
because I tend to feel out words and
languages, rather than understand
them from a literary point of view.
However, the fact that I couldn't
come close to defining my favorite
word troubled me. The dozens of
lectures I watched on creativity, the
hours I pondered over the concept
- all these were futile attempts.
Eventually, I got so sick of the ques-
tion of how to define creativity that
I stopped thinking about it. I told
myself to stop wasting time with a
word and move on by wasting time
with something else that was rela-
tively more productive. A favorite
word is a pretty stupid and useless
thing to worry about, anyway.
During the summer, I interned at
Ogilvy and Mather, a global adver-
tising agency in Delhi, India. Itwas
in the second half of my intern-
ship as a copywriter in the creative
department where I found the
answer to my initial questions.
I believe that creativity is the

ability to see, perceive and experi-
ence internal, sometimes ineffable
thoughts and emotions and trans-
form them into a tangible form.
For example: I might be walking
towards class, and out of nowhere,
an idea for a short story might hit
me. Surely, that doesn't happen
to everyone and it is, as far as I'm
concerned, the first sign of beinga
creative person. The second, more
crucial aspect of creativity is act-
ing upon such incidents by pro-
ducing something that represents
the epiphany you just had. This is
why artists paint and draw, writ-
ers write and musicians write and
sing - all these art forms are sim-
ply different manifestations of that
mysterious internal processingthat
allows them to seethings in their
mind's eye and feel things in their
hearts. Creativity is a culmination
of two things - the skill of getting
to an idea without a process and
the skill of giving a tangible form to
that idea.
The first part of my dilemma
was solved, but I still didn't know
why I considered creativity such
an important trait. Eventually, I
discovered that our personalities
aren't always composed of inher-
ent traits; sometimes, it's the things
that you value the most that come
to be a defining part of you. Not
all personality traits are innate.
For example, you don't have to be

born with an inherent talent for a
particular sport. But if you grow
up watching a sport, believing that
it is important to you, it's likely
that you'll derive a major part of
your personality from the values it
teaches you, even if you don't excel
in it.
I had realized that I was attached
to the word because I valued it. But
why did I value it?
It was the fifth grade and I had
just been handed my score for a
writing assessment in my English
class. It was a letter-writing test
and the letter was graded on a scale
of one to ten. I was the last person
to receive my score and I couldn't
believe it when I saw it. I had been
graded a 9.5/10. I was absolutely
ecstatic. We were always told in
school that attaining a perfect score
in any English assignment was
impossible, because "there's always
room to improve what you're say-
ing." The highest anyone could get
in any English writing assignment
was a point below the upper limit of
the scale. The fact that I had been
awarded an extra half point meant
so much to me and I can remember
feeling proud of it even a few weeks
after the scores had been given out.
In fact, I'm still a little proud of it.
I admit that's a little sad but I can't
help it if I'm still a fat nine-year-old
boy inside, can I?
The point is, that was the first

time I felt that I was genuinely
good at something. I had beaten the
smartest kid in the class and I was
on top of the world. My teacher told
me that I'd been given half a point
extra, because the letter "was cre-
atively written." That particular
feeling of discovering I was good at
something has stayed with me ever
since.
Yet, despite how important that
feeling was to me, the truth is -
I've never experienced it again
after that day. Why? Because I
don't do many things that I feel I'm
genuinely good at. Also - I rarely
write. Ideas tend to hit me all the
time, on the bus, while walking to
class, while showering and even
when I'm a party when really all I
should be thinking about is down-
ing my drink. But, I just cannot
bring myself to write. Is it because
I think that everything I write will
turn out to be pathetic drivel and
I'll have to come to terms with the
fact that the fifth grade letter was
exactly that - a fifth grade writing
assignment and nothing more? Or
is it just pure laziness?
While attempting to write this
piece, at three in the morning, I
watched an episode of "Inside the
Actors Studio," and it all came back
to me. How a seemingly insignifi-
cant word and a juvenile feeling of
pride meant more to me than I real-
ized.

Training the next generation of female robo-builders
by Jesse Klein

At the Women of Science and Engi-
neering Office, Lego pieces were
trewn over the floor and computers
with circuitry programs peaked out from
behind unkempt, frizzy adolescent hair,
tween pop and Disney songs played in the
background. "Let's get down to business"
hummed on Pandora as conversations about
light sensing and line tracing drowned out
Captain's Li Shang's sung question; "Did
they send me daughters?/ When I asked for
sons."
Yes, yes they did. And just like Mulan,
they and the rest of the female robotic engi-
neers are going to prove
that he should have been
asking for them in the first
place.
M Go Blue Bots is an
after-school program for
middle school girls run
by the University. This
all-girl team, including
the college undergraduate
mentors, build and pro- <
gram a robot to autono-
mously complete a series
of tasks for competition.
Aerospace Engineer-
ing Prof. Ella Atkins, local
program chair for the
IEEE International Con-
ference on Robotics and
Automation, said middle
school is around the age
where girls sometimes
lose their interest and
confidence in math and ,
science.
"It's not socially 'in' for
a girl to be in programs
like First Robotics," she'

to blame. Robotics require knowledge in
every type of engineering, from electrical
and mechanical to computer coding, and a
team oriented discipline. It's in these types
of settings where women can be at a disad-
vantage.
"(The team) sees a girl andthey see some-
one who is organized and will make a good
spreadsheet," Atkins said. "And because of
this you don't see as many women building
the actual parts."
But in that build room on the third floor
of the Undergraduate Science Building
there are no men. These girls and women

valid input. The expectation of inadequacy
can take a toll on female engineers.
"I had a friend tell me he wants to switch
genders with me for the career fair," How-
ard said. "So then when I get a job, I feel like
am I only here because I am female."
"It's like they didn't hire you for your
capabilities and are surprised by them,"
said Engineering sophomore Marisa Wite-
palek.
And Howard said she heard comments
like, "You did really well for a female
intern."
The older generation of female robotics

are delving into how automated machines
could address these new issues
"If you just have software or you just
have physical things you are limited," How-
ard said. "But if you combine the two like
in robotics you can make something awe-
some."
According to Tilbury, the challenge is
showing that "robots can help people in
hospitals or help the elderly stay in their
homes."
The combined masters and Ph.D. pro-
gram in robotics that started at the Uni-
versity this year is only the third of its
kind, following programs at Carn-
egie Mellon University and Georgia
Institute of Technology. Students
take courses from all aspects of engi-
neering from the mechanical side
like kinematics and dynamics to the
computer vision and software styles.
The wide array of skills needed
for robotics was a driving force in
the creation of this new interdisci-
plinary program. Currently, robotics
research and programs at the Uni-
versity takes place in eight different
buildings around campus, but after
the creation of the new masters and
Ph.D. program, the University has
begun planning a centralized robot-
ics building on North Campus.
Women make up about 20 per-
cent of each of the undergraduate,
masters and doctoral programs in
engineering at the University, but
the robotics Ph.D. program at the
University in robotics is 60 percent
female.
Rackham student Megan Richey
became interested in robotics after
W/Daily seeing the animatronics at Disney
World and she was hooked ever since.
Richey works on human robot interaction,
creating software that detects and respons-
es to human emotion.
Richey recently spent the weekend at
the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women
in Computing Conference, celebrating the
accomplishments of women in technol-
ogy. Of the 8,000 women at the conference,
she said each had a different reasoning for
becoming interested in computer science
and its applications
"Some people had always liked engineer-
ing, others had mentors who pushed them,"
Richey said. "It kind of pushed me to into
wanting to be a mentor so I could push
women into robotics."
As machine automation becomes more
widely recognized as a field of academic
study, and as more women are encouraged
to work with technology from a younger
age, the outlook for the number of women
who choose to work with robotics is noth-
ing but positive.

, 1othing about the sciences is easy. None
of the professors looks like Doc Brown.
Not many more resemble Albert Ein-
stein, or for that matter any other frizzy-haired
stereotype in popular media. And not much
about scientific work comes "naturally" - any
assertion that students must be born with a nat-
ural inclination toward it is untrue. Science is a
painfulslog, mired in often-unrelenting calcula-
tion, stuck in a perpetual cycle of trial and error,
so that its very nature - a search for an exact,
quantifiable truth - demands effort. Science, in
the purest sense of the word, is a meritocracy.
Then why is it that inthe vast majority of sci-
ence and technology courses offered at the Uni-
versity, most students are male? It's a question
thrown around a lot in department offices not
just in Ann Arbor, but across the nation, where
even though women have earned nearlyl0 mil-
lion more college degrees than men in the past
30 years, they continue to lagbehind in STEM-
related (Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics) fields. It's also a question which
has larger implications about the state of femi-
nism on university campuses in the age of social
media and transparency. One explanation cites
STEM's stagnant reputation.
"Unfortunately, science has become one of
those things where the larger population seems
to think that you have to be born to succeed,"
said Tim McKay, the director of the LSA Hon-
ors Program and former associate chair of the
University's physics department. "That there's
some magical quality within the people pursu-
ing itletting them do well."
According to research performed by the
National Science Foundation, of the total num-
ber of undergraduates working toward a bach-
elor's degree in physics in the United States,
less than 20 percent are women. That statistic,
whichshowedstrongsigns of growth in the late
1990s and early 2000s, has consistently fallen
over the last decade. From 1990 to 2002, the
percentage of women awarded bachelor degrees
went from 17.4 percent to 22.9 in physics. In the
twelve years after, the number has tapered off
and fallen to 19.7. The result is acutely mirrored
in the University's own physics department,
where growth has stalled, the number of female
physics graduates fluctuating toward the low
teens despite the department usually awarding
around So degrees in total.
Cinda-Sue Davis, director of Women in Sci-
ence and Engineering (WISE) and a former bio-

chemistry research scientist at the University,
believes that changes have to be made in the
way schools introduce engineeringto prospec-
tive students.
"Researchers who study how individuals
make career choices find that individuals gen-
erally ask themselves two questions: 'Can I do
it? That is, am I capable of doing the work?'"
she said. "High school girls in this country are
more prepared than ever before to enter STEM
careers. More girls in this country take the AP
calculus exam than boys. This has not always
been true but is now."
"The second question is, 'do I want to do it?'
This is more complicated as issues of gender,
race, socioeconomic class, first gen. college sta-
tus and many other factors are involved," Davis
continued. "We don't do a very good job at illus-
trating the excitement and rewards of careers in
STEM. And we don't show students how these
careers help people which is often important to
girls and women."
Part of the problem, McKay states, is the
department's struggle to attract any students
willing to commit to a career in physics. As
listed by the American Physical Society, when
examining 1,000 University of Michigan stu-
dents, fewer than10 are physics majors.Ofthose
10, maybe two are women, and the statistics are
even more lackluster when considering the per-
centage of underrepresented minorities study-
ing in the department. Nationally, 8.6 percent
of the people committing to physics degrees are
minorities while at Michigan, it's half that num-
ber.
According to reports by the registrar, even
though the University has seen an average of 78
Native American undergraduates between 2010
and 2014 (they make up 0.21 percent of the stu-
dent body),not asingle one has received a bache-
lor's, master's, or Ph.D. in physics. The numbers
are scarier when considering Black students.
An average of 1777 (approximately five percent
of the student body) were enrolled in the Uni-
versity between 2010 and 2012, but in that time,
only two left with a bachelor's in physics.
A proposed solution asks institutions of high-
er learning to consider mandating certain intro-
ductory science courses, so more students have
a chance to at least experience what the syllabus
may have to offer before embarking on a differ-
ent path.
"I really don't think that would be the best
answer," McKay said. "Making this change

would be predicated on the idea that the prob-
lem is they're not taking that class, and if we
could justget them to take that class, then every-
thing would be fine."
"I think the choice people make in choos-
ing the things they do depends more on what
they're attracted to, not what they are driven
away from," he continued.
One fact worth keeping in mind, though, is
that the physics department is not representa-
tive of all STEM fields. When considering the
social sciences or biology, the percentage of
minorities and women are higher, but still not
equivalent to white male representation.
Getting anearlier start
The physics department currently has a slew
of outreach programs dedicated to sparking that
attraction, many created and run by the Society
of Physics Students and the Society of Women in
Physics (SWIP). Though the larger effort entails
getting all individuals to express an interest in
the subject - not specifically women or under-
represented minorities - McKay still believes
the support systems provided by organizations
like SWIP are integral to confronting the larger
problem: marginalization.
"We need it to be completely clear to women
that it's a welcoming field," McKay said. "And
part of this is ensuring they have a community
of individuals like them that they can draw on
and rely on."
In their collective push, the physics depart-
ment participates in the yearly Conference
for Undergraduate Women in Physics, where
women from different institutions can find a
network of young scientists with similar experi-
ences.
The disparity in numbers is certainly not lim-
ited to physics, but multiple accounts have clari-
fied why one of the reasons it persists in related
fields is a lack of focus in cultivating interest at
a younger age. In an article for The New York
Times article headlined "Why Are There Still

with a physics degree from Yale in1978.
