Forum confronts race relations

Following #BBUM,
students address
how campus climate
can be improved
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Following the viral #BBUM
Twitter campaign initiated by
the Black Student Union to bring
awareness to issues faced by
people of color on campus, BSU
and multiple other University
gioups held a forum Tuesday
night to focus on tangible solu-
tions.
More than 150 people
attended the event, which
ended with two proposals:
Rackham student Garrett Fel-
ber's plan for an affirmative
action teach-in next year and
Rackham student Maite Rodri-

guez-Caballero's request that
the next University president
focus on establishing a better-
funded, more conveniently-
located Trotter Multicultural
Center. The current location
is east of the intersection of
South University and Washt-
enaw Avenues.
The Black Student Union,
Rackham Graduate School's
SCORE, the Department of
Afroamerican and African
Studies and We Are Michi-
gan were all sponsors of the
event.
LSA senior Tyrell Collier,
BSU's president, said three more
initiatives following the nation-
ally-trending Twitter campaign
will be announced as early as
the end of this semester.
Before planning specific
actions to further the commu-
nity's goals, attendees spoke
about their own campus expe-
riences. This followed Tues-

day's Freeze Out protest and
the #BBUM trending cam-
paign.
Students discussed their frus-
tration with the lack of change
that has occurred on campus
despite administration empha-
sis on diversity. Some discussed
how they were tired of the treat-
ment they receive at the Univer-
sity, others regarding how the
Black community needs to be
more unified.
LSA junior Rolly Abiola,
the Trotter student manager,
said she was exhausted by the
University's lack of action
to ameliorate its attitude
towards minorities, despite
promoting itself as liberal
and diverse.
"I am sick and tired of the
way this university continues to
silence us," Abiola said. "I keep
getting up and I keep talking
because I am afraid of what will
happen if I stop."

LSA senior Ozi Uduma cried
when she admitted that she
often didn't wish to be at the
University, but her voice gath-
ered strength as she discussed
the warm relationships she
holds with her fellow female
students of color.
"I hope that we learn to
love each other better, love
each other fiercely, love
each other strongly," Uduma
said. "This movement can-
not work unless we love each
other."
Leon Howard, a residence
hall director and president of
the Association of Black Profes-
sionals, Administrators, Faculty
and Staff - said minority staff
and students have parallel expe-
riences.
"Instead of being the only
Black person in the room, you
might be the only Black person
on a committee," Howard said.

Black Student Union
campaign shows
what it's like to be
Black on campus

University students took
to Twitter in droves Tuesday
afternoon to share their expe-
riences as Black students in
Ann Arbor and bring attention
to issues of race and diversity
on campus using the hashtag
#BBUM.
The campaign, initiated by
the University's Black Student
Union, has built up over the
past few days before trending
nationally on Twitter Tuesday.
The hashtag gained momentum
after the student organization
distributed an e-mail to commu-
nity members and other campus
groups encouraging them to par-
ticipate in the online conversa-
tion.
LSA senior Tyrell Collier,
BSU's president, said the #BBUM
campaign was planned to raise
awareness of the experiences of
Black students and for the BSU
to collect subjective data it can
couple with University statistics
to address pressing issues Black
students face.
Collier said BSU encouraged
students to tweet both nega-

tive and positive experiences,
though the tweets have been pre-
dominantly negative, which he
expected.
He said the issue is especially
pressing on campus because
while the University frequent-
ly discusses ways to increase
diversity, many communities
have yet to witness tangible
results.
"I would like to see the lives
of Black students valued more,"
Collier said.
By 10 p.m., over 10,000 tweets
included the hashtag from Ann
Arbor and beyond.
"I don't think this is a problem
specific to the University, I think
it's an experience that Black stu-
dents at predominantly White
universities across the nation are
facing," he said of the far-reach-
ing responses.
Black enrollment at the Uni-
versity has fallen precipitously
over the past decade largely
due to Proposal 2, an amend-
ment to the state constitution
that bans affirmative action
policies that was passed by
Michigan voters in 2006. The
proposal, formally named the
Michigan Civil Rights Initia-
tive, bars the University from
considering race in its admis-
sions process.
Immediately after the passage
of the proposal, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman gave a
dramatic address on the Diag
promising to maintain the Uni-
versity's commitment to diver-

CAMPUS LIFE
Profs engage in
spirited debate
on Jewish foods

Campus Hillel
r asks faculty what's
better: Latkes or
Hamantashen?
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
Tuesday, members of the Uni-
versity community came togeth-
er at the University of Michigan
Hillel to contest one of the most
controversial questions in the
history of Judaism: Which food
is better, the latke or hamantash?
Latkes and hamantashen are
both essential foods in Jewish
culture. Latkes are fried potato
pancakes traditionally eaten on
Chanukah, the Jewish festival
of lights, served with sour cream
or applesauce. Hamantashen
are triangular pastries eaten on
Purim, a holiday commemorat-
ing the Jewish people's survival
in the ancient Persian kingdom.
The pastry is often stuffed with
sweet fillings such as nuts, dates,
cherries, chocolate or cheese.
The University of Chi-
cago hosted the first Latke-

Hamantash debate in 1946. Not
able to find a definite conclusion
to the mighty question, the uni-
versity decided to rehash the
issue annually. Since then, other
universities such as Johns Hop-
kins University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Amherst
College and Harvard University
also put their best professors to
the test finding the superior dish.
Tuesday evening, the Univer-
sity finally joined these schools
to debate the superiority of the
two time-honored Jewish cui-
sines.
LSA junior Paul Feingold, who
brought the debate to campus,
began the night by welcoming
both Jews and "righteous gen-
tiles" and introducing moderator
Tilly Shames, executive director
of Hillel.
Feingold said he hoped the
event would bring students
together for a humorous evening
and help them see professors in
a more relaxed and fun environ-
ment.
"One of the big goals here we
have at Hillel is to get new people
through the door all the time and
engage new students into the

Over 100 people, includ-
ing students from local high
schools in Ann Arbor and
Detroit, attended a march and
rally Tuesday afternoon held
by organizations including
By Any Means Necessary, the

Coalition to Defend Affirma-
tive Action, Integration and

Organizers said the
march had multiple purpos-

of affirmative action, an
increase in the enroll-
ment of black, Latino/a and
Native American students
and in-state tuition and
financial aid for immigrant
students who were brought

dren," according to a press
release.

Protesters chanted, "Black,
Latino, Asian and White, by
any means necessary we will
fight," and held posters with
slogans and flags from the
represented high schools and
the University.
University alum Kate Sten-
vig, a national organizer for
BAMN, said regardless of the
laws in place regarding affir-
mative action, the Univer-
sity should be doing more to
increase minority enrollment.
University Police officers
arrived at the Diag follow-

A 19-year-old Liberty Univer-
sity student died Tuesday morn-
ing when he was shot by a public
safety officer at an all-female
dorm at the school's Lynchburg,
Va., campus, The Liberty Cham-
pion reported.
Lynchburg police responded
to a call around 4 a.m. A physi-
cal altercation then occurred
between the student and a
police officer, who then shot the
student.
It is unclear whether the
student was armed. Police said
the officer shot at the student
at least twice. The officer was
taken to the hospital for treat-
ment and was later released.
"The Liberty University com-

munity is deeply saddened by
this tragic event and is prayer-
fully supporting all those
impacted," Jerry Falwell Jr.,
Liberty's president, said in a
statement.

in the 2008 death of a freshman
student, The University of Dela-

In November 2008, Brett
Griffin, 18 at the time, attended
a pledge event at the fraternity.

During the party, he became
unconscious and was left alone
in a room. He began to foam at
the mouth, 911 was called and he
died later that night.
His autopsy showed that he
had ingested an entire fifth-
sized bottle of Southern Com-
fort liqueur, resulting in a blood
alcohol content of .341. Alco-
hol poisoning was noted as the
cause of death.
The lawsuit against the
brothers argued that former
chapter president Jason Aaron
and former pledge master
Matthew Siracusa were liable
for his death.

Early N.M.votes oppose
late-term abortion ban

New bill offers tax relief.
to keep students in state

Initial results show
56 percent of voters
against proposal
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP)
- A closely watched, first-of-
its-kind proposal to ban late-
term abortions in New Mexico's
largest city was trailing in early
returns Tuesday.
Initial results from 50,000
early and absentee ballots in
Albuquerque showed 56 percent
of voters against the proposal,
while 44 percent supported the
ban on most abortions after 20
weeks.
City officials said more
than 36,000 votes that were
cast Tuesday remained to be
counted.
The municipal election was
being closely watched as a pos-
sible new front in the abortion
wars, which have traditionally

been waged at the federal and
state levels.
The vote capped an emo-
tional and graphic campaign
that drew national groups and
hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars in advertising, pictures of
abortion victims and one pro-
test comparing abortion to the
holocaust.
Police were stationed near
polling places around the city
as protesters from both sides
tried to persuade voters who
were lining up before the polls
closed. One school reported an
hour wait.
Michelle Halfacre said she
cast her ballot in favor of the
proposal, which would ban
abortions after 20 weeks except
to save the mother's life.
"I had an abortion when I
was young, and I regret it,"
Halfacre said. "I don't believe
in it."
But Jonathan Cottrell, a crisis

hotline volunteer, said he voted
against the proposal because he
believes it marks the beginning
of a "slippery slope to ban abor-
tion in general."
"I feel that women have the
right to choose what to do to
their body," Cottrell said.
NARAL Pro-Choice America
President America Ilyse Hogue
said this is the first munici-
pal ballot on abortion that she
knows of, and her group was
watching the election closely.
A legal challenge is expect-
ed if the referendum passes.

By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Contingent upon the pas-
sage of Senate Bill 408, recently
graduated students looking for
employment will receive a state-
sponsored incentive to work in
Michigan.
The bill, which was voted out
of committee and sent to the full
state Senate last Wednesday,
would give graduates of private
and public Michigan schools a
tax credit equal to 50 percent of
the annual payment on their stu-
dent loans for each tax year they
live and work in Michigan.
In a statement, state Sen.
Glenn Anderson (D-Westland),
the bill's sponsor, characterized
it as one part of a bigger over-
all approach to address rising
tuition costs and the growing
need for a more educated work-
force.
"My legislation addresses two
significant problems in Michi-
gan - the growing student loan
debt crisis for college graduates
and the economic brain drain we
experience when our students
move to other states after gradu-
ation," he wrote in the statement.
"The credit would be a financial
incentive for graduates to stay in
Michigan."

tem.
The tax reduction per person
would be capped at 20 percent
of the average annual tuition for
Michigan schools, and graduates
would be eligible to receive the
reduction forup to fiveyears. The
bill defines an eligible graduate
as someone who has completed
at least a bachelor's degree at any
of Michigan's private or public
colleges and universities.
An analysis performed by the
Senate Fiscal Agency estimates
that the bill would reduce state
revenue by $29.4 million for the
2013-2014 fiscal year, and has
projected that it could cost the
state up to $152.9 million by the
2017-2018 fiscal year.
While those numbers are
large, they don't necessarily rep-
resent a net loss for the state.
Don Grimes, a senior research
associate at the University's
Institute for Research on Labor,
Employment and the Economy,
pointed out that the demograph-
ic this bill is aimed at - newly
graduated students with at least
a bachelor's degree - have both
a high-earning potential and
are very likely to leave the state
without incentives like this.
"If you can keep (recently
graduated students) here for five
years, the probability that they
will stay in the state after that

increases dramatically, and the
state will keep all of their addi-
tional income tax payments,
which would have been lost if
they had moved out of the state,"
he said.
Grimes added that "people
who earn bachelor's degrees
tend tobe big net contributors to
the state and local government
budgets, and they pay much
more in taxes than they cost the -
state and local government in
extra services."
LSA junior Lisa Tencer, presi-
dent of the University chapter of
Pure Michigan Talent Connect,
a group that encourages students
to stay and work in the state after
graduation, said from a student
standpoint, the bill definitely 0
makes Michigan a more enticing
post-graduation option.
"According to USA Today, 44
percent of the U-M class of 2011
were in debt when graduating,"
said Tencer. "This is a growing
concern to many of my peers who
would indeed find this tax credit
extremely attractive. Many cit-
ies such as New York City and
Chicago seem more attractive to
graduates because of the higher
rate of pay and larger popula-
tion."
A similar bill, HB 4182 -
which included recommenda-
tions and research from the
University chapter of the Col-
lege Democrats and the Roos-
evelt Institute - was introduced
to the State House in February
2013 by state Rep. Andy Schor
(D-Lansing). It has been in com-
mittee since April.

in the Democrat-controlled

Asked if other cities with
late-term abortion clinics

Shaver said: "We are encourag-

bans tobacco sales

Mayor Michael Bloomberg
signed landmark legislation
Tuesday banning the sale of

in the country to prohibit sales to
young adults.
During a brief ceremony at
City Hall, Bloomberg said rais-
ing the legal purchase age from
18 to 21 will help prevent young
people from experimenting with
tobacco at the age when they are
most likely to become addicted.
City health officials say 80 per-
cent of smokers start before age
21.
The mayor, a former smoker,
also signed legislation setting a

Suicide bombers struck the

bollah - both supporters of Syr-
ian President Bashar Assad.
The double bombing in a Shiite
district of Beirut pulled Leba-
non further into a conflict that
has torn apart the deeply divided
country, and came as Assad's

Monthly sessions
at Connor O'Neill's
combine food,
presentations
By BRIE WINNEGA
For the Daily
If the informative atmo-
sphere doesn't get you to attend
Wednesday night's Science Caf,
the free food might.
One Wednesday every month,
students, faculty and community
members alike flock to Conor
O'Neill's Irish pub on Main
Street to learn about and discuss
current science-related news.
Guests are invited to arrive at
5:30 p.m. on the evening of the
Caf6 to find a seat at one of the
pub's banquet room tables and
enjoy free appetizers. At 6 p.m.,
presenters take turns introduc-
ing themselves to the audience,
explaining their area of work and
involvement with the evening's
discussion topic.
Audience members at each
table are then invited to talk
amongst themselves and have
questions answered by the pre-
senters. During the remaining
half hour of the Caf, the audi-
ence reconvenes to continue dis-
cussing the issue ina large group
format.
The program derives its name
from the Caf6 Philosophique
movement that began in France
in 1992. Scientists in the country
worked to educate the public on
current scientific issues by hold-
ing gatherings at popular meet-
ing places.
The Ann Arbor Cafes began
in 2007 under the initiative of
Kira Berman, assistant director
for education at the University's
Museum of Natural History.
Berman decided to introduce
the program after realizing that
much of the museum's program-
ming was targeted toward young
people and not the adult Ann
Arbor community. She wanted
to create a relaxed environment
that would allow scientists to
interact and share information
with the public.
"The larger goal is scientific
literacy," Berman said. "It's to
help the public understand Uni-
versity of Michigan research
and its value, to help people be
engaged in issues of science that
relate to public policy and to help
people enjoy learning about sci-
ence."
The Science Cafes are open to
everybody, and Berman chooses

topics based on what science is
being reported in the news.
LSA junior Jaykob Wood, a
frequent participant in the cafes,
said they're both educational and
entertaining, providing the pub-
lic with an opportunity to learn
from researchers ina given field.
"The audience is interested
and asks many questions," Wood
said. "It's very interactive as
well. People are encouraged to
spark conversation and ask ques-
tions concerning the issue in the
second half of the dialogue."
Wood is looking forward to
this month's Caf, which will
take place Wednesday night
and cover issues regarding
high-volume hydraulic fractur-
ing, or "fracking" - a method
of natural gas mining that has
seen an increased popularity in
and around Michigan. Assistant
Engineering Prof. Brian Ellis,
Biology Prof. Knute Nadelhoffer
and Kim Wolske, a research fel-
low in the Business School, will
host.
Berman said the Caf6 will
teach the public about the dan-
gers that fracking may pose.
"We'll learn what the poten-
tial is within our state for the
development of this industry,
what we know about where the
concern areas are and what the
right kind of regulation would
look like," Berman said.
October's Cafe topic focused
on the honeybee crisis in the
United States due to a mono-
crop agriculture system. One of
the presenters during the Cafe
was Lisa Bashert, director of the
Ypsilanti Food Co-op's Local
Honey Project.
Bashert said she liked being
able to connect with and inform
a large audience that she normal-
ly doesn't have the opportunity
to reach out to.
"One thing that I continuous-
ly learn from audiences is how
truly disconnected people are
fron. the natural environment
and natural systems," Bashert
said.
The Science Cafes are working
to remedy this disconnect, Bash-
ert said.
"It certainly helps the public
understand the questions that
are faced with public policy and
understand some of the solu-
tions that might be being tried at
the moment and help to form an
informed opinion," Berman said.
"If you enjoy talking to people
about current events and current
issues, and even politics, the Sci-
ence Cafe would be something
you would enjoy."

Florida man was
charged with third-
degree felony by
girlfriend
SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -
George Zimmerman's girl-
friend said he tried to choke
her about a week ago during
an altercation that was not
initially reported to police, a
prosecutor told a judge Tues-
day during Zimmerman's first
court appearance on domestic
violence-related charges.
Samantha Scheibe feared
for her life because Zimmer-
man mentioned suicide and
said he "had nothing to lose,"
according to Assistant State
Attorney Lymary Munoz.
After the hearing, Zim-
merman's public defenders
said he did not appear to be
suicidal and expressed confi-
dence he would be acquitted of
any wrongdoing in Monday's
domestic dispute.
Hours later, Zimmerman
was released from jail after
posting $9,000 bond. He was
seen walking out of the jail
smiling and getting into a car.
Judge Frederic Schott
ordered him to stay away from
Scheibe's house, wear a moni-
toring device and refrain from
contact with her. He was for-
bidden from possessing guns
or ammunition or travelling
outside Florida.
Zimmerman has been
charged with aggravated
assault, a third-degree felony
punishable by up to five years
in prison. He also has been
charged with battery and
criminal mischief, both misde-
meanors. An arraignment was
set for Jan. 7.
The judge said Zimmer-
man's previous brushes with
the law were not a factor in
the conditions he imposed, but
he did cite the new allegation
of choking as a reason for the
bond amount.
Earlier this year, Zim-
merman was acquitted of all
charges in the fatal shooting
of teenager Trayvon Martin
in a case that drew worldwide
attention. The Justice Depart-
ment has been investigating
whether to file civil rights
charges against Zimmerman
related to Martin's death,
and a department spokesman
said Tuesday that it would
announce its decision soon.
Zimmerman, 30, wore gray
jail garments and handcuffs
during the hearing and spoke
only when answering yes or no
to the judge.
Public defender Jeff Dowdy
said Zimmerman's family has
been supporting him finan-

cially.
"I would think it would be
difficult for George Zimmer-
man to get a job in central
Florida," he said.
In an affidavit filed Tues-
day, Zimmerman asked for a
public defense, saying he has
liabilities and debts of at least
$2 million and no income. He
said he had less than $150 in
cash on hand.
Dowdy and another public
defender, Daniel Megaro, said
Zimmerman was not suicidal.
"Hedoesn't appear to be a
danger to himself or a dan-
ger to anybody else," Megaro
said.
Zimmerman has previously
used a website to raise money
for his legal and living expens-
es, including $95,000 spent on
bail in the Martin case. The
site also says tens of thousands
of dollars were spent on living
expenses and security.
The most recent posting on
the site, weeks before Zimmer-
man's acquittal, said the fund
ran out of money in late May
but raised tens of thousands
more after public requests for
help.
A link to donate via PayPal
did not appear to be working
Tuesday.
In this latest scuffle, both
Zimmerman and his girlfriend
called 911 and provided duel-
ing descriptions to dispatch-
ers about the argument at the
home she rented where Zim-
merman was also staying.
Scheibe accused him in the
emergency call of pointing a
gun at her, smashing a coffee
table and then pushingher out-
side. Zimmerman also called
dispatchers, denied pointing a
gun at her and blamed her for
the broken table.
The girlfriend told depu-
ties the ordeal started with a
verbal argument and that she
asked Zimmerman to leave
the house. Her account in the
arrest report says he began
packinghis belongings, includ-
ing a shotgun and an assault
rifle. She says she began put-
ting his things in the living
room and outside the house,
and he became upset.
At that point, the report
said, he took the shotgun out
of its case.
Zimmerman told his girl-
friend to leave and smashed a
pair of her sunglasses as she
walked toward the front door,
the report said. Scheibe told
deputies he pushed her out of
the house when she got close
to the door.
"You point your gun at my
fricking face," Scheibe is heard
telling Zimmerman on a 911
call. "Get out of my house. Do
not push me out of my house.
Please get out of my house."

Seconds later, she told the
dispatcher, "You kidding me?
He pushed me out of my house
and locked me out.... He knows
how to do this. He knows how
to play this game."
Moments later, Zimmer-
man called 911 from inside
the house to tell his side of the
story.
"I have a girlfriend who, for
lack of a better word, has gone
crazy on me," Zimmerman
said.
Zimmerman then said he
never pulled a gun on his girl-
friend and that it was she who
smashed a table. He also told
the dispatcher that Scheibe
was pregnant with their child
and that she had decided she
would raise the child on her
own. When Zimmerman start-
ed to leave, "she got mad," he
said.
Seminole County Chief
Deputy Dennis Lemma said at
a news conference that Scheibe
was not pregnant. He also said
Zimmerman was compliant
and unarmed when deputies
came to the house.
On Tuesday, Dowdy said he
could not confirm whether the
girlfriend was pregnant.
The arrest on Monday was
the latest legal problem for
Zimmerman since he was
acquitted last summer of crim-
inal charges in the fatal shoot-
ing of Martin. Zimmerman has
said he shot the 17-year-old to
defend himself during a fight
in February 2012 inside a gated
community in Sanford, just
outside Orlando.
Relatives of Martin, who
was black and unarmed,
accused Zimmerman of racial-
ly profiling the teen and insti-
gating a fight. Zimmerman,
who identifies himself as His-
panic, said he shot the teen in
self-defense. The case sparked
nationwide debates about race
and self-defense laws.
In September, just months
after his acquittal, Zim-
merman was accused by his
estranged wife of smashing an
iPad during an argument at the
home they had shared. Shellie
Zimmerman initially told a
dispatcher her husband had a
gun, though she later said he
was not armed.
No charges were ever filed
because of a lack of evidence.
The dispute occurred days
after Shellie Zimmerman filed
divorce papers. George Zim-
merman was served the papers
while in custody on the latest
charges, said Shellie Zimmer-
man's lawyer, Kelly Sims.
In 2005, he had to take
anger-management courses
after he was accused of attack-
ing an undercover officer who
was trying to arrest Zimmer-
man's friend.

Smarter streets
Local ordinance dangerous to both drivers and pedestrians
n Nov. 19, Ann Arbor City Council voted 8-3 in favor of repeal-
ing the city's contentious crosswalk ordinance. Under the ordi-
nance, drivers had to stop whenever a pedestrian was at or
approaching a crosswalk - regardless of what traffic signs and lights
were signaling. While the ordinance attempted to improve pedestrian
safety in a town that increasingly pushes drivers to "share the road," the
law has put both walkers and drivers in danger. Though the city council's
decision to overturn this dangerous law is in the best interest of all Ann
Arbor's travelers, it must be followed with substantial improvements to
the city's crosswalks.

$4 billion for the University, with $1 billion directed towards student support.

In July 2010, the city's crosswalk ordinance
went into effect, stating, "When traffic-control
signals are not in place or are not in operation,
the driver of a vehicle shall stop and yield the
right-of-way to every pedestrian approach-
ing or within a crosswalk." Prior to the ordi-
nance, the city followed state law, which calls
on drivers to yield to pedestrians walking
through crosswalk on the driver's side of the
road. While the distinction between the local
and state laws seem slight, supporters of the
ordinance argued that the law, supported by
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hiefjte, would give the
city's pedestrians the upper-hand.
But in the three years following the ordi-
nance's passage, there hasn't been a sig-
nificant reduction of pedestrian-vehicle
accidents - in 2012, 60 accidents occurred
in the city, compared to the 36 accidents in
2006. While it's not clear if those numbers
reflect a more dangerous environment for
drivers and pedestrians or simply a rise in
commuters, they do suggest that Ann Arbor
hasn't become safe, despite the promises of
the ordinances' proponents.
The language of the ordinance may, in fact,
lend itself to more distracted drivers. Under
the ordinances, drivers have to watch for
pedestrians in a wider area as well as check
their rear-view mirrors to make sure they
would not be rear-ended should they stop
abruptly for a pedestrian crossing the street.

Perhaps most importantly, the lack of public-
ity surrounding the ordinance diminished its
potential benefits. Just one year after the law's
passage, Erica Briggs, a city planning commis-
sioner and board member for the Washtenaw
Bicycling and Walking Coalition, argued most
people are unaware that they're supposed to
stop at crosswalks. The lack of information
surrounding the ordinance is an especially
dangerous element when out-of-towners are
considered. Without clear, uniform signage
around all the city's crosswalks, tourists com-
ing into Ann Arbor are likely to not know
about their responsibilities as a driver.
If the city council passes ordinances to
improve safety, the dissemination of infor-
mation is crucial to go along with the passing
of these ordinances. City council should also
consider improving the existing crosswalks
before implementing further pedestrian regu-
lations. Many of Ann Arbor's crosswalks are
poorly lit, if at all, and have limited signage to
alert drivers to pedestrian crossings. Increas-
ing lighting, signs and roadway stripes will
improve pedestrian safety and alert drivers to
the presence of pedestrians.
In December, the city council will bring
the ordinance to a vote once again, due to a
law that mandates two rounds of voting to
overturn a city ordinance. The council should
continue to stand against the ordinance while
bringing in new safety features for the city.

On Nov. 18, a group of faith lead-
ers on campus issued a statement
contending that a T-shirt of a Vic-
tors for Michigan attendee which
read "Victors for Moral Antigayism"
is not a sentiment shared by all faith
communities. "The Victors event was
about showcasing 'the Leaders and
the Best' that this campus offers,"
the authors wrote. "The presence of
an anti-gay message had no place at
the event or on this campus."
The incident got me thinking
about the identity of the Victors for
Michigan campaign. Who can call
themselves victors? Who - and what
- are we fundraising for?
I went back to watch the campaign
promotional videos in my attempt to
answer these questions. The videos
are what you'd expect from fundrais-
ing campaign marketing materials -
inspiring and convincing. The videos
highlight the accomplishments and
opportunities that the University
offers: cutting-edge research, proj-
ects in developing countries, a vast
selection of study abroad programs
and, last but not least, phenomenal
students. I felt proud.
However, after my initial sense
of pride subsided, I felt angry. The
videos only told half the story of the
University - one that I don't com-
pletely relate to.
What was left unspoken infuri-
ated me. The University experience

is not all positive. The videos weren't
talking about those who struggle
with mental health on a daily basis,
members of the LGBTQ community
who still feel unsafe on campus, stu-
dents who have to work 40 hours
a week just to make ends meet or
sexual assault survivors whose jus-
tice the University has not fought
for. The videos do not discuss how
we often have to make the choice
between coursework and our well-
being, and that our society pressures
us to choose the former over the lat-
ter. The videos do not explain why
a student with a disability recently
informed me that he felt like the Uni-
versity does not adequately address
his needs and only goes as far as offi-
cial policies require of it.
In sum, the campaign's videos
made me feel like I don't count.
It's truly a privilege to be here at
the University where I've come to
embrace our legacy and our public
mission. But the University is not
adequately representing all its stu-
dents and it can do better.
Let me be clear: I am not adver-
sarial to the University or the Victors
for Michigan campaign. What I am
against is false advertising, elitism
and injustice. I'm against the Univer-
sity broadcasting that it has a public
mission without the public mission
being embedded in the campaign.
Yes, capital campaigns are meant to

raise money. But beyond the $4 bil-
lion target, capital campaigns should
be an opportunity for disruptive
innovation, for change and for all
of us to feel like we're together and
working towards a brighter future.
The campaign needs to tackle those
egregious cracks in our system more
than the cracks in our buildings.
What about a different kind of
video? One that says:
"Yes, we struggle with social jus-
tice. Yes, we struggle with LGBTQ
inclusion. Yes, we are aware of stu-
dents who struggle with mental
health and disability issues. We do
care about these people and we really
need your contribution to create new
programs that address these issues.
"Look, these may not sound great,
but all higher-education institutions
face the same challenges we do. We
want to truly embody the slogan
'Victors for Michigan' and make sure
that we represent all our students, so
we're highlightingthese issues today.
"We need your help more than
ever to change the system."
Now, this video would be one hell
of a fundraising tool. The big question
remains: Is the University willing to
take a risk and spread this message?
In the spirit of our public mission, I
sure hope the answer isyes.

On Nov. 13, on the top floor of C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, I spent the evening exam-
ining the dozens of heartwarming, telling pho-
tographs that filled the room for the Save A
Child's Heart Photo Exhibition. So often, Israel
is associated with conflict, but the exhibition
highlights one of the most successful humani-
tarian efforts in Israel beyond the conflict.
The photographs, taken by diverse and
acclaimed photographers, tell the story of the
work done by Save a Child's Heart, an Israeli-
based international humanitarian project that
aims to improve pediatric cardiac care for
children in developing countries. Each picture
told a story, aiming to capture the emotions,
the patients and the doctors associated with
SACH's wide-reaching efforts. Each picture
was tastefully well done, and I felt the impact
that SACH has had on children in need of car-
diac care.
The photographs depicted the emotions felt
by the SACH patients. In some pictures, chil-
dren looked somber and afraid. In others, the
children looked relieved and happy. It was pow-
erful to see glimpses of the humanitarian work
of Israelis.
At the same time, the photo exhibition sad-
dened me. It's unsettling to know that so many
children in underprivileged areas suffer and
that so many don't have a resource like SACH
available. Despite all of their success, SACH
will never be able to cure everyailment, but the
lives they change daily putthings into perspec-
tive: Not only are we incredibly lucky to have
these resources availabletous,butwe also have
an opportunity to help. Luckily, those in Israel
and even some here in Ann Arbor have found a
way to help with SACH.
One of those people hereinAnn Arbor is the

rt message
world-renowned surgeon, Edward Bove, chair
of Cardiac Surgery at the University Hospital,
who was also at the exhibition. Bove worked
with Save a Child's Heart as he trained Leor
Sasoon from 1998 to 2000 at Mott. Sasoon is
now chief of the entire cardiothoracic depart-
ment for SACH.
Bove spoke about how touching it is to
know that his teachings have helped positively
impact lives all around the world. It reminded
me that if you give a mana fish, he will eat for a
day, but if you teach a man to fish, he will eat for
a lifetime. I guessthe same can be said for heart
surgery: Give a child a heart surgery; their life
will be saved. Teach a man to perform life-sav-
ing surgeries, and perhaps they will save thou-
sands of lives.
Ashley Israel, a local attorney and prominent
SACH supporter in Michigan, spoke while I
was at the exhibition and he stressed the pro-
found impact that the organization has made
and continues to make on the doctors and vol-
unteers who spend time at the Wolfson Medi-
cal Center and the SACH home in Holon, Israel.
The greatest success of the photo exhibition,
other than its ability to tangibly display the
work of SACH, is its ability to empower those in
the room to improve themselves and the world
we live in.
The exhibition, which continues at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Hillel, came to Ann Arbor
thanks to the American Movement for Israel,
a multi-opinioned, pro-Israel student group
on campus. I'm thankful that AMI and SACH
were able to bringthis exhibition toAnnArbor,
and I encourage others to check out the photos
as well.

The time has come where we are
being asked by everyone around us,
"So, what's next?" Many of us have
just spent the past 17 years - 81 per-
cent of a21-year-old's life - inschool.
Many ofus have plans to attend grad-
uate or post-graduate school, but the
thought of immediately committing
another two to 10 years to studying
is, at the moment, unfathomable.
Enter the gap year. Many people
see the year or two between school-
ing as an opportunity to travel or to
do research that will bolster their
resumes. Others, not knowing what
to do, figure that despite their expe-
riences (or lack thereof), they could
always "just teach." After all, how
hard could it be, right?
Wrong.
Teaching is one of the most mis-
understood professions in our soci-
ety. Movies such as "Bad Teacher"
and "School of Rock" feed us pro-
paganda that portrays teachers as
nothing more than babysitting free-
loaders. People who decide they'll
just teach or fall back on teaching
when they're at a crossroads in
their lives further perpetuate this
inaccurate stereotype.
This representation could not
be further from the truth. The
best actualization I can provide of
a teacher's job is this: Imagine you
had to give a 20-minute presenta-
tion for a course. You spend hours
outside of class combing through

research, going to office hours and
gathering materials for your pre-
sentation. Now imagine the prepa-
ration that would be required if you
had to give hour-long presentations
five times a day, five days a week to
an audience with varying cognitive
abilities, attention spans and blad-
der control. Welcome to the tip of
the teaching iceberg.
Numerous programs exist that
will throw an intelligent, eager,
wet-behind-the-ears, recent college
graduate into an inner-city class-
room with a mere two months' train-
ing. To people who have dedicated
their entire undergraduate careers
to the study of education, this is
nothing short of a slap in the face.
Nearly every teacher in the nation
is required to devote a given amount
of credit hours in educational stud-
ies and at least one full semester of
student teaching, with many schools
requiring an entire year. Despite this
excessive preparation, almost all
teachers look back at their first year
on the job remembering a perpetual
raincloud of assessments, 15-hour
workdays and the reality that a bell
dictates when they are allowed to
urinate. If someone who has spent
the last five years preparing for his
or her job feels overwhelmed, how,
then, can someone with zero teach-
ing experience and two months of
"training" expect to succeed?
It's no coincidence that nearly

40 percent of teachers who enter
programs such as Teach For Amer-
ica and Teaching Fellows leave the
classroom after a mere two years.
The corps members enter the class-
room, realize they're not equipped
to teach, and only get it right after
numerous attempts and failures.
In some cases, the exhaustion that
accompanies this unpreparedness
can damage the mental health of
a fellow. That's the catch of these
programs: They recruit highly
intelligent, successful students and
set them up for massive and utter
failure that they are not used to.
While I'm a huge advocate for the
personal growth that results from
failure, I simply cannot condone it
when it affects the education and
wellbeing of children.
So, to my fellow peers who are
wondering what to do after gradu-
ation, I cannot iterate enough that
teaching is not a stepping-stone to
the next phase of your life. Teaching
is a career that nobody should enter

Being Black at the University of Michigan has
many shades and many levels to what some-
one might want to speak on it. It can go from
someone being the only Black person in their
class to someone with no problems at all."
- LSA senior Eric Gaver said in an interview with The Michigan Daily about the #BBUM campaign on
Twitter. The campaign is aimed at raising awareness surrounding issues of diversity on campus.

sity. However, the institution has
been unable to stanch the decline
in minority enrollment through
alternative outreach policies in
the wake of the affirmative action
ban.
In Fall 2006, Black stu-
dents made up around seven
percent of the undergraduate
population. In Fall 2013, the
University reported that Black
undergraduate enrollment had
fallen to 4.65 percent. Hispanic
enrollment as a percentage of
the overall undergraduate body
also declined over the same
period.
At a search forum for the next
University president in Sep-
tember, the Presidential Search
Advisory Committee - which
includes the University's Board
of Regents - heard from a num-
ber of students about diversity
issues. Several student speakers
at the event said many minorities
feel they lack a voice on campus
and occasionally experience bias
incidents with both students and
instructors.
Collier said the University
has not yet contacted BSU about
Tuesday's campaign. Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
stressed that the University's
next step will be to listen to the
students and their experiences on
campus.
"I think at this point the lis-
tening is the most important
part and how we might respond
is the next step and we haven't
_ gotten there yet," Fitzgerald
said.
He said the University is aware
of students' concerns and recog-
nizes that there is always room
for improvement in any organiza-
tion.
However, the University's
social media team responded
to the campaign via Twitter
Tuesday afternoon: "Thanks
for engaging in this conversa-
tion. We're listening, and will be
sure all of your voices are heard.
#BBUM"
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president for stu-
dent life, created a Twitter
account late Tuesday to address
the issue.
"Got on Twitter to hear and
support your voices. Proud of our
students. More later," Harper
PARTNERSHIP

AIIMS has the only freestanding
trauma center in India, accord-
ing to Krishnan Raghavendran,
an associate professor of sur-
gery at the University's Medical
School.
The University of Michigan
Health System and AIIMS trau-
ma centers partnered in 2010,
but now the entirety of the medi-
cal institute and the University's
Medical School are in collabora-
tion.
University medical students
may now study at AIIMS,
where Raghavendran said stu-
dents get the opportunity to
practice in a totally unfamiliar

environment in which tropi-
cal ailments, advanced dis-
eases and a lack of resources
are daily encounters. He added
that it's important that Ameri-
can medical students accustom
themselves to a less-than-plen-
tiful future medical environ-
ment so that they're prepared
for the worst.
"The way the current medi-
cal system is functioning in this
country cannot be sustained over
long periods of time," Raghav-
endran said. "There is enormous
wastage and inefficiency, and we
all have to learn how to function
with limited resources in the
near future."
AIIMS faculty members
already visit the University's
Medical School on a regular
basis. This new agreement cre-
ates research collaboration on
topics such as immunology and
stem cells. AIIMS will have
access to a low-cost virtual
university to educate its staff
* and more IT resources to expe-
dite their projects and medical
libraries, where Raghavendran
said doctors can research pro-
tocol for handling certain dis-
eases.
AIIMS director Mahesh
Misra said in an e-mail that
both universities are highly
esteemed in their respective
countries for research, teaching
and healing.

wrote.
LSA senior Eric Gavin, BSU's
public relations chair, said
several recent campus events
spurred the organization to plan
a campaign, including a recent
controversy involving Theta Xi
fraternity members who branded
a party with racialized images
and words.
BSU also timed its Twitter
campaign to correspond with
a forum this evening hosted by
the Department of Afroamerican
and African Studies, the Black
Student Union, We are Michigan
and Students of Color of Rack-
ham.
BSU hopes to not only engage
members of its organization but
also Black campus leaders from
an array of groups, Gavin said.
However, leaders didn't believe
the student organization would
receive national attention for its
efforts.
"I definitely could not have
foreseen the national attention
we have garnered in such a short
amount of time," Gavin said.
"We felt it necessary to push for
an initiative that would bring
more awareness to these issues
and to the larger Black commu-
nity."
Though traditional methods
such as campus demonstrations
play a role in raising awareness,
Gavin said BSU decided social
media could serve as an addi-
tional method for sparking dia-
logue.
"It kept it open ended and
that's why it so successful," Gavin
said. "The hashtag leaves for open
ended interpretation so people
can say what they feel instead of
imposing somebody's thoughts
on them."
So far, students have voiced an
array of perspectives.
"Being Black at the Universi-
ty of Michigan has many shades
and many levels to what some-
one might want to speak on
it," Gavin said. "It can go from
someone being the only Black
person in their class to someone
with no problems at all. It's a
spectrum, but we want people
to be aware of everyone's differ-
ent ideas on the issue of being
Black at the University of Mich-
igan."
Renowned journalist Michele
Norris, the creator of the Race
Card Project - a nationwide
initiative that gathers per-
spectives on race and aims to

foster dialogue on the subject
- partnered with the Univer-
sity during last winter's theme
semester on race, and will give
the 2013 Winter Commence-
ment address.
In a form similar to BSU's
campaign, Norris used Twitter
to broaden the reach of the Race
Card Project because she said
even though the social media
platform only allots users only
140 characters, it's a powerful
way to stimulate uncomfortable
conversations.
"I used to say the most
productive conversations are
the private ones, but Twitter
made me rethink that," Norris
said.
Norris noted that the Univer-
sity did not "take cover" once
the dialogue took off, but rather
embraced the campaign and
encouraged students to take part
in the conversation, which is not
always the norm for large institu-
tions.
"This is an honest conversa-
tion," she said. "They wanted to
see an honest conversation and
that's what this is, as uncomfort-
able as this may be for people to
read about this."
She said diversity has been
an issue on every college cam-
pus she has visited, and after
reading the tweets from Tues-
day's discussion at Michigan, it
is likely the topic isn't going to
subside once the Twitter debate
dies down.
"It really was not just people
talking about their own experi-
ences, but it turned into an actual
dialogue," she said. "People were
talking to each other and perhaps
even learning from each other,
and more importantly listening
to each other."
Norris added that she will
likely address the issue in her
commencement address next
month.
By asking students to share
their experiences as Black
students on campus, BSU is
hoping to not only bring light
to challenges, but also to
call other student leaders to
action.
"We want to get the aware-
ness out so we can begin to move
forward and actually do tangible
things," Gavin said.

Jewish community," Feingold
said.
Four University professors
used their rhetoric skills, com-
piled intelligence, effective evi-
dence and sharp rejoinders to
make the case for their choice
dish.
Representing Team Latke
was Prof. Zvi Gitelman, who is
also a Preston Tisch Professor
of Judaic Studies, and Asso-
ciate Prof. Julian Levinson.
Defending Team Hamantash
were Jan Gerson, a senior lec-
turer, and Prof. Ralph Wil-
liams.
Gerson started off the night
using her economics expertise in
defense of the hamantash. Using
the logic of economist Adam
Smith, who proposed that soci-
ety benefits when individuals act
according to their self interest,
Gerson came to the conclusion
that the question "better boils
down to is 'in my opinion' which
is better."
Therefore, Gerson said
because she personally believes
hamantashen are better, they are
indeed better.
Levinson countered Gerson's
argument with the concept of
"camouflage-ability." He argued
that the latke is a versatile food:
if an individual decides they
would like to "Jew it up," Levin-
son said he can tell everyone he
is enjoying a hot, savory latke.
However, if another individu-
al is feeling timid, or if she is

Officers were present when
students unexpectedly scat-

A UMPD official added that
the the group's presence was

versity of their intent to dem-

For LSA senior Chloe Brown,
the recent change in campus race
relations is palpable, and not for

the better.
"It feels like there's just some-

"There's just something in the

Levinson further argued that
because the leading brand in
kosher products, Manishewitz,
has seven types of latke mixes
and no recipes for hamantashen,
the latke must be the leading
Judaic commodity.
"Why hasn't Manishewitz
made a single box of hamantash-
en? I'll leave that question up

The event occurred in the
midst of the #BBUM Twitter
campaign initiated by the Uni-
versity's Black Student Union,
which drew national attention as
it raised awareness for the issues
and experiences of Black and
other minority students at the
University.

patients will not be the only ben-
eficiaries: AIIMS is opening six
new facilities. The procedures
that the University is passing
onto the New Delhi institute
will be implemented across cen-
tral and northern India, serving
areas that lack comprehensive
health care.
AIIMS currently sees 10
times as many patients as the
University Hospital. Center for
South Asian Studies director
Farina Mir - part of the Uni-
versity delegation - explained
that India's enormous popula-
tion raises interesting ques-
tions for students visiting the
country.
"How do you work with and
operate in a society where every-
thing is at a magnitude big even
for us in the United States?" Mir
said. "It produces opportunities
for us to think big, which Michi-
gan is really good at."
Undergraduates in India
and at the University will ben-
efit from two other alliances
formed with Ashoka Univer-
sity and University of Delhi.
DU was one of the first uni-
versities in India, and is hailed
across that country as one of
the best undergraduate colleg-
es, particularly for the sciences.
Ashoka, conversely, will open in
fall 2014 and will focus on the
humanities.
Both universities complement
the University's focus on teach-
ing, Mir said.
"The key here is that we want
to produce mechanisms that
would create opportunities to
participate in experimental
learning in India," Mir said.
"The core of agreements are
around students and student
opportunities and exchanges.
We're excited about the oppor-
tunities that will open up almost
immediately."
One such educational venture
that will soon be open to Uni-

versity students is a 10-day train
ride around the subcontinent.
Students from other universi-
ties on this trip conduct mini
research programs, Mir said,
like gauging the pollution of
each train stop. She added that
this differs with study abroad
programs where students may
not immerse themselves in the
country.
"It really would put them right
there in the thick of things,"
Mir said. "This is going to be a
roll-up-your-sleeves type of pro-
gram."
DU students will be able to
conduct research as under-
graduates at the University, an
experience that's rare for under-
graduates living in India. Pro-
fessors at the newly established
Ashoka University will benefit
from the University's long teach-
ing heritage.
"Students are at the core of
these two projects and we really
think that the kinds of opportu-
nities that will come out of this
will be mutually beneficial," Mir
said.
The fourth institute to
enter an agreement with the
University last week was the
National Council of Applied Eco-
nomic Research, the leading sur-
vey research institute in India.
NCAER and the University's
Survey Research Center hope to
explore new methods of research
through mobile technology
and advanced statistical tools,
according to William Axinn, the
director of the Survey Research
Center.
Axxin wrote that the part-
nership will allow the Univer-
sity's web of long-term partners
to expand and NCAER to fur-
ther explore public policy ini-
tiatives.
"This gives us the opportunity
to both globalize our education-
al work and advance the social
sciences through comparisons
across different contexts and set-
tings," Axxin wrote. "Globaliza-
tion in general, and work in India
specifically, help us to build new
approaches, methods, and tools
that advance the social sciences
worldwide."

Wolverines still in search
of scorers late in games

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Sophomrore linebacker James Ross III led Michigan with 13 tackles against the Wildcats over the weekend.
Michigan answering the
cal to finish close games

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Last year, with just seconds
remaining in the Michigan
men's basketball team's Sweet
16 matchup against Kansas, the
Wolverines trailed, 76-73. There
was no question who would
take the final shot - everybody
inside Cowboys Stadium knew it
would be Trey Burke.
It was the case throughout
the season. When games were
on the line, the Wolverines
knew to get the ball to Burke,
and when it counted most, the
ninth-overall pick in last year's
NBA Draft stepped back into
nearly the first row of seats and
drained the 3-pointer heard
'round Ann Arbor.
After falling to Iowa State on
Sunday, one thing became clear:
Michigan doesn't have a defini-
tive closer at the moment. The
Wolverines have a wealth of
shooting talent and players who
can drive to the rim, but they
don't have an established ringer

The Michigan football team's
Thursday practice always con-
sists of the offense and defense
going up against each other to
close out the week.
Earlier this season, the
defense would falter in the red
zone against the offense and
often missed assignments.
So defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison coined a simple phrase
during practice, one he constant-
lyrepeated toremindthe defense
of the mindset it needed.
"Finish it."
And last Saturday against
Northwestern, the offense could
be heard shouting that motto to
its defensive counterparts on
the field in a way that reminded
Michigan coach Brady Hoke of
the cheering on the sideline of a
high-school game.
The result was what Mat-
tison called the best defensive
performance he's seen all sea-
son, and the phrase has become
emblematic of the defense Mat-
tison wants to see game in and
game out.
"Northwestern was a very
good offense, a hard offense for
the guys to defend because they
could do so many things," Matti-
son said. "Whenyou play against
a quarterback like (Kain) Colter,
you make one mistake and you
aren't where you're supposed to
be, it's a 20-yard gain, at least.

over the summer to work on his
game, showed that he could be
the player that Michigan looks

50 percent from the field so far
this season.
Stauskas scored 20 points
on Sunday, 15 of which came in
the second half, when he went

Despite missing three of his

his misses were more the result

With Beilein's confidence in

Beilein said of the players he'd

that Nik had the best flow at the

First Lady is'Scandals 
true gladiator

Making theater
out of 'Thin Air'

he following column
contains spoilers for the
most recent episode of
"Scandal" as well as discussion
of potentially triggering topics
such as rape
and sexual
violence.
Over the
past two
years, Mellie
Grant, the
fictional first
lady played KAYA
by Bellamy UPADHYAYA
Young on
ABC's "Scan-
dal," has
steadily become the best writ-
ten and most fascinating female
character on television.
Thursday's episode, tragically
titled "Everything's Coming
Up Mellie," begins with Mellie
giving a tour of the East Wing
for an upcoming TV special
meant to serve as an apology for
discussing her husband's affair
on live television. Because,
* somehow, Fitz's infidelities
are her fault. "It's not fair; it's
America," Cyrus remarks with
what should be this show's new
tagline. Mellie turns on her
sweet Southern charm, forc-
ing laughter and chatting about
parties and art collections and
china sets and all the other
"First Lady things" we know
she hates.
Then, the show pulls us back
to 15 years prior in Santa Bar-
bara, Calif., where Fitz's guber-
natorial election and political
career are just in their soft-
focus-filter-covered beginnings.
But the spotlight for these
flashbacks shines on a young
Mellie Grant, who, together
with Fitz's father Big Jerry and
a bearded Cyrus, pushes Fitz
to run for governor a few years
earlier than he expected. The
flashbacks reveal Big Jerry for
the controlling, demeaning,
oppressive monster he is. One
night, after lamenting to Mellie
how he's not as bad of a father
as everyone makes him out to
be, he rapes her.
The harrowing scene has
been met with objection, with
many critics accusing the show
of hollowly insinuating that
the Mellie we know today -
the calculating, frigid politi-
cal mastermind - was borne
from her horrific experience.
During the episode, my Twit-
ter timeline broke out in com-
plaints over how strong, smart,
powerful women shouldn't
have to have that strength,
intelligence and power come
from first being broken.
Using rape for character
development is problematic
more often than not. Showing
sexual violence in film and
television poses a whole set of
complications. All too often,
rape is used merely as a plot
device, or worse, as voyeuristic
torture-porn, stripped entirely
of significance or discourse.
The scene in "Scandal" isn't
gratuitous - horrifying and
indelible, yes, but not indulgent
nor out-of-sync with "Scandal"
's tone. This is a series full of
torture and murder and all the
ugliness that dictates Ameri-
can politics and social power.

Even though it's tricky to do
well, I'd rather TV acknowl-
edge that rape and sexual
violence exist than ignore it
completely. And Mellie's expe-
rience reveals many tragic
truths of sexual violence: It
oftentimes is perpetrated by
someone the victim knows and
regularly goes unreported.
According to EW, the epi-
sode "helped humanize" Mel-
lie. Bethonie Butler over at the
Washington Post says the writ-
ers have been trying to make

Students to perform
in an entirely
improvised show
By PAIGE PFLEGER
Daily Arts Writer

people and not knowing any of

their show,
"Thin Air." Walgreen
They have four Drama Center
performances
for which they
will make up an entire 50-min-
ute play on the spot.
The idea for "Thin Air" came
from graduate student Mat-
thew Flickinger. Though he is
studying biostatistics as a Ph.D.
candidate in the School of Pub-
lic Health, Flickinger's favor-
ite hobby since high school has
been the art of improvisation.
"Thin Air," as Flickinger
pitched it to Basement Arts, is
an entirely improvised one-act
play, made to look as much like
a planned performance as pos-
sible, including scene changes,
lighting, sound and more.
"More and more people
are familiar with improv and
improvisation," Flickinger said.
"Maybe they've seen stuff like
'Whose Line is it Anyway?'
but there are a lot of different
styles of improv out there, and
when you get a group of people
together, there are a lot of dif-
ferent kinds of shows that you
can create."

"Thin Air" aims to go back
to the roots of improvisation,
inspired by such great impro-
visers as Keith Johnstone, Viola
Spolin and Kenn Adams, who
wrote "How to Improvise a
Full-Length Play: The Art of
Spontaneous Theater."
"I just thought that this was
another type of improv that I
hadn't had direct experience
with before," Flickinger said,
"and I thought it might be pos-
sible to bring that to life and
to try something again that
wasn't purely short-form jokes,
but maybe told an interesting
story."
"Thin Air" found its home
in Studio One, after receiving
four allotted show dates from
Basement Arts. The cast of the
show didn't have to recite lines,
monologue or read sides from a
script to get the part - instead,
they played improvisational
games and learned to interact
and react to other characters,
all the while creating character
depth for themselves.
"I had a great time at audi-
tions," said LSA sophomore and
cast member Clare Brennan. "I
wasn't nervous, because I think
what usually makes me ner-
vous is, 'Oh my God, am I going
to remember anything? Am I
going to crack or something?'
But with this one, there were no
expectations because I hadn't
prepared a single thing, so I get
to go in and do whatever they
tell me to do."
The handpicked improv
group practices in the Walgreen
Drama Center five days a week,
clocking 15 hours of rehearsal
in which multiple plays are
created on the spot, never to
be repeated again. Rehearsals
aren't for memorizing lines and
blocking - they're for practic-
ing improvisational techniques

and learning how to properly
time and craft a storyline.
"We don't have one script
to work toward," Flickinger
explained. "So what we do is a
bunch of directed improvisa-
tional exercises. There are cer-
tain skills I want my team to
feel comfortable with, I want
them to have a lot of experience
with, so that it comes naturally
to them. We work on things
like, how do you make stories
more dramatic? How do you
raise the stakes in a scene natu-
rally? How do we create a world
that is believable?"
Though the five players
all come from different back-
grounds, they have grown over
time to show a camaraderie that
can only be compared to friend-
ship, and a close one at that.
They are not afraid to make
themselves look ridiculous by
crawling on the ground as a uni-
corn, being an elderly lady, giv-
ing each other piggy-back rides
and saying yes to whatever is
asked of them while trying to
maintain a straight face.
"It's totally terrifying," Bren-
nan said, "but really fun at the
same time because I know that
I'm in it with four other people
that are in the same position,
and an audience who came in
not paying anything and knows
exactly what they're getting out
of this. So I think we're all in it
for the ride, and I think we're
ready to see what this iscapable
of."
"Thin Air" is one of the only
plays that can boast that audi-
ence members will see a com-
pletely different performance
every night the show runs.
The actors are not only being
characters in a play; they are
writers, directors and, most
importantly, improvisers, cre-
ating a show out of thin air.

Why do we go to college? We all
have different answers. Butsome-
thing that motivates most of us is
the prospect of a good job after
school, the idea of being a part of
the mystical "distinguished alum-
ni" and perhaps even one of the
coveted spots on the University's
alumni Wikipedia page.
On Nov. 19, one such alum,
Kip Lewis, class of 1994, is set to
release his latest cinematic work,
"Planes," to DVD.
Lewis, 41, is a Michigan native.
He attended Romeo High School
and graduated from the Univer-
sity with a B.A. in Screen Arts
and Culture. He now works for
Disney in California, serving most
recently as an associate producer
for "Planes," the spin-off from the
hugely successful "Cars" movie
franchise.
So, what inspired this Michi-
gander to get into film?
"Honestly, this is going to be
totally cheesy," Lewis said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily, "but when I was in high
school, I watched 'Dead Poets
Society.' I walked out of that
movie feeling like if I could have
a career that would allow me to do
something that might be as mean-
ingful to people as that movie was
to me at the time, then I would be
successful in my own eyes."
After graduating from the Uni-
versity, Lewis attended Califor-
nia Institute of the Arts (CIT),
where he received his MFA in
Experimental Animation. He said

'say that it's been worth the wait.
You're gonna wanna tear this
'album up like a goddamned corn
on the cob.
For you spineless chodes
who are unfamiliar with the
sweet, sweet melodies of Mr.
* Hutchins, Beef is a dad and musi-
cal artist who has been making
-quality dance-slash-soft-rock-
slash-chunk music in his sedan in
:Albany, NY since the late eighties.
In an interview with the Michi-
*gan Daily, Beef explained the
:hardships of recording in a sedan.
" "We would record one instru-
:ment at a time because that's all
that fit," he said. "It takes a while.
S* 'In '98, we got a hatchback - oth-
;erwise, it still wouldn't be done."
* 'Now, finally, he has bestowed
-upon the world his LP, Firehorses,
and I think I speak for all of us
*}when I say, thank God for that
; hatchback.
- Firehorses opens with "Piggy
Back," a track that, underneath
R its funky overtones, speaks of
+'deep yearning for a piggy back.
'It's clear that Beef is trying to
mask some deep insecurity in
'this track
swith the First seen on

back or not. The track features
the velvety vocals of rap sensa-
tion Mool P. Sanders ("The cool-
est kid in school," according to
Beef), who spits out rhymes
about things we all can agree
upon such as piggy backs and
cheese. The song ends with a
frantic repetition of the chorus,
demonstrating just how desper-
ate poor Beef is for his piggy
back. It ends with a tortured
"Aaoowwww," leaving listeners
to wonder, did he ever get his
piggy back?
The album's tone brightens
somewhat in the subsequent
track, "How Beautiful I've
Become," in which Beef admires
his flawless looks, singing, "I'm
peeeeeerfect." When asked
how he became so beautiful,
Beef explained, "How? I don't
know. I became this beautiful in
1995." The track eventually cul-
minates in impeccable, intense
falsetto and a sax that takes it
away in a warm, smooth solo
oozing with the love of one's
own good looks.
And the good mood contin-
ues in "Ham!" - a faster, upbeat
track that doles out much-
deserved praise for the beloved
processed pork foodstuff. Much
like in "Piggy Back," Beef
emotes intense yearning for
ham, singing, "Oh baby, gimme
ham gimme ham gimme ham
gimme ham!" Firehorses is an
album that craves and desires,
and Beef is a man on a mission
for fulfillment. While many lis-
teners undoubtedly will wonder
why Beef chose to sing about
ham rather than everyone's
favorite Greek protein source
Chobani, Beef's decision to

praise ham shows that he's not
afraid to take a risk every now
and then - to be a little edgy.
But Firehorses doesn't take
itself too seriously in its long-
ings. Take the hit single, "Party
Shart," for instance. It's an
explosive track full of shimmer-
ing synths that prove the eight-
ies ain't dead yet. This is the
anthem for partying until you
shart. Move over, old anthem
for partying until you shart -
there's a new track in town! Get
ready to hear this song at all the
cool college parties - this is a
bumping track that will have
you running for the bathroom.
It's a FUN TRACK.
And Beef isn't afraid to
explore topics of sexuality in his
tunes. Whether it's the pleasant,
sing-songy track, "Quit Lezzin'
Around," the loud and proud
"I'm Bi" or the sweet and senti-
mental "Your Big Purple," Beef
is a man who lets it all hang out.
In "I'm Bi," Beef allows his father
to guest-sing as they proclaim
their sexual orientation - "I'm
bi, so is my dad / I'm his dad, and
I am bi / I'm bi, me and my dad /
We're two bi guys, give us a try!"
"I'm Bi" is filled with flourishes
of saxophone and funky guitar
that really do make you want to
give Beef and his dad a try. In
"Your Big Purple," the "big pur-
ple" thing in question is actually
a cooter - "It's so good for me,"
Beef croons. This muff-centered
melody expresses a wide variety
of emotion, from disdain for fruit
leather, to lush praise for purple
coot.
Firehorses ends on a poignant
note with the track "Chubby Boy,"
filled with rich orchestral harmo-
nies and weighty piano as Beef
details his history with a certain
chubby boy. "Do you remember,"
Beef asks, "When we were rid-
ing in the back of the bus / And
the driver went over a bump and
our butts went off the seat? / I
realized you didn't get quite as
much air / The other kids made
fun of you / But of course I didn't
care." This track features a sad
yet seductive electric guitar solo,
and the feeling of yearning that
permeated the beginning of Fire-
horses returns in "Chubby Boy"
as Beef wonders in his raspy, ach-
ingly earnest voice where his dear
chubby boy went off to. Clocking
in at almost five and a half min-
utes, this song is definitely the
longest on the album, and it seems
like a strange choice to end Fire-
horses on such a morose note.
But I'm not beefin' you.
Firehorses will bake your ziti.
It will make you drop trou. It
will make your crab rangoons
double - nay, triple - in size. It
will make you so excited you'll
have a horse baby on your din-
ing room table. It will boost
your cul-de-sac cred by twenty
percent. Listen, all I have to
say is, Yanni's got some serious
competition.

- Lynda Heyl
"Your article is very nice, but I have to take some pause to
think about the goals of university fundraising. My own experi-
ence as a 'small donor' is not quite in line with what Mr. May
describes. I believe he is a sincere fundraiser, and I have had
positive interactions with some of the regional developmental
people, but this office has allowed athletics to take over vis-a-
vis students.
I desired to increase my gift last year to UM, but as a season
ticket holder, was forced to increase my gift to the 'personal
seat donation', for which university donations did not count. I
believe that 80 or so per ticket is actually a good donation to the
university, since players do not get paid and since we have more
fans than any other school attend games. When I complained
to Mr. May, to President Coleman, and to Dean of LSA, nobody
cared--they said they don't control athletics ... "

Oh, winter. It's a season that
comes with so much promise -
the chance to hide your inevita-
bly paling, dry skin under layers
of patterned tights, plaid vests
and large sweaters. But, more
often than not, you end up throw-
ing on black yoga pants, those
Ugg boots you promised you'd
never wear again and a North
Face pullover most likely layered
under a North Face parka. With
the cold weather rolling in these
past few weeks, our campus has
accurately reflected that change
in wardrobes. This physical
manifestation of the mood of stu-
dents at this point in the year isn't
exactly a cheery one.
However, there are histori-
cal and "scientific" reasons for
dressing in dark colors in the
winter and whites in the sum-
mer. Many of us probably grew
up with our parents telling us to
wear lighter-colored clothing in
the summer, as they reflect the
sun's rays better than dark colors
do. This is, in part, true. Howev-
er, the reason we feel hot in the
summer has more to do with how
breathable the material is, not the
color. And thus wearing dark col-
ors in the winter isn't really going
to absorb the sun's rays and keep
you warmer.
This somewhat faulty logic
became a fashion rule in the
early to mid-twentieth century,
according to Charlie Scheips,
author of "American Fashion."
Magazine editors usually lived
in Northern cities, and they saw
white as a color that could combat
city heat. Dark colors were thus
saved for fall due to the threat of
being splashed by mud during a
cold rain. This strategy of dress-
ing was seen in magazines at
the time, and quickly permeated
throughout the rest of America.

According to TIME maga-
zine, many historians argue that
around the 1950s, the rule of not
wearing white after Labor Day
became more rigid as the middle
class expanded and the elite held
onto their more traditional rules
as a way to separate the decorum
of their "society."
Labor Day marks the end of a
summer of leisure, and the return

of more serious values, like hard
work and stability. Dark colors,
such as black, brown and navy,
tend to draw those associations.

This isn't the first time I've been to
Michigan. Five years ago, I went
through the state on my way
home to New Jersey after protesting
the Republican National Convention
in Minneapolis. I didn't stop in Ann
Arbor, but spent most of my time with
an anarchist collective in Detroit, The
Trumbullplex crew. We partied, then I
continued on to my destination.
That trip was one of many adventures
that punctuated my post-high school
years. That is to say, I didn't spend six
years at community college before
coming to University of Michigan -
I traveled, worked, played and did ...
other things. But six years and two
associate's degrees later, I find myself
back in the lower peninsula, this time
for an extended stay.
I find that the return gives me an
opportunity to reflect on some of the
long-term changes in my life. Some are
obvious: I am engaged to my partner of
two years, Alex. Some changes, though,
are a little more insidious. Something
happened in the last three years, which
were devoted primarily to excelling
at community college - I became
comfortable.
To my younger self, this state of
affairs would have been antithetical.
I had been restless and desultory and
feared stagnation, which many people
call contentment. But I suddenly had
friends with whom I shared more than

a few days of my life. Friends that I
could go have a drink with after finals,
instead of just drinking because it was
that time of the day (noon).
The common term for this
transformation is "growing up," but
I have to be honest - it's really hard
to feel like a grownup as a junior in
college, regardless of my age. Every day,
I am surrounded by people as much as
six years my junior, whose sole intent is
to find themselves, and I see them doing
so, sometimes several times a day.
Meanwhile, my application to the
University was predicated on the
assumption that I had already done
that. Not that I was naive enough to
assume that I had figured out exactly
who I was and would always be, but I
had worked hard to get where I was,
and I felt somewhat duty-bound to
build on my successes.
With that in mind, I tackled my
degree head-on, trusting the reserves
of confidence I had built over the past
few years to see me through to my
bachelor's. I took only three courses,
to give myself room to acclimatize, and
diversified my remaining time with
undergraduate research, clubs and The
Michigan Daily - by all accounts a
well-balanced college lifestyle.
It took me a month and a half to realize
my mistake: I hadn't factored in that most
crucial element of a college experience -
socialization. It had been so many years

since I'd had to make new friends that
I didn't just forget how, I forgot that I
needed to try at all. Sure, I was amicable
and friendly, but I somehow forgot that
actual effort has to be made in order to
connect with others.
With that understanding, I have
started to reach out more, striking up
the odd conversation, suggesting a
study session here and there, and seeing
where it leads - I even got invited to a
party! (Not the kind that you could just
walk into without knowing anyone.)
Still, there is a consistency lacking. I
can see most of Central Campus and the
Hill neighborhood from the desk where
I write, and I still feel disconnected;
the athletic fields and south campus
neighborhood forming a gulf between
me and the crucible of relentless social
interaction that would presumably
define a "normal" college experience at
one of the residence halls.
I know that such assumptions are
pulled from pop culture and probably
bear little resemblance to the collective
reality of a majority-defined sense of
"normalcy," but I can't help it, I want
my "storybook" college experience -
replete with silliness, feuding, hijinks,
adventures and most of all, friendship
(really, the only piece that I wouldn't
mind leaving out at this point is
heartbreak).
But it's not just any friendship I want,
I want the kind of friendship where

you make plans and promises that you
could never rationally keep. I want tom
get calls at 3 a.m., just because someone
else can't sleep and wants company;
I want people to look at me, with my
group of friends, and think one word -
"deranged."
My path through higher education
could single-handedly define the
"nontraditional" college experience,
and it's difficult to rationalize my
accomplishments with everyone I see
having their "normal" ones. I know that
I have seen, done and accomplished
things that some dream of - important,
meaningful things - but I can't shake
this envy. All too soon, my peers will
consist of professionals in situations
where childish wistfulness is, at best,
discouraged.
I know that I can't force this. These
are the types of relationships that take
years to form, but at this point, I have
less than two. I am scared that I will
come away from my college experience
unfulfilled. But don't they say that
admission is the first step towards
recovery? I suppose the only thing leit
to do is go out and recover my sense
of adventure. These years are still my
opportunity to try new things; I just
hope I can find the right people to share
those experiences with.

The force behind physics demonstrations
by Austen Hufford

n a large, empty Dennison lecture
hall Friday afternoon, three
people wheeled in a large copper
_Tesla coil, a device that produces high-
voltage, low-current electricity. After
efficiently setting everything up, the
device was powered on. An off-kilter
electric sound filled the hall and bright
blue sparks emanated from the coil's top
in seemingly random directions. Two
people slowly walked around the coil -
intently checking for misplaced internal
connections.
The power was cut. Someone
mentioned the machine sounded off,
and a protective shielding panel on the
device was removed. An internal part
was adjusted - by mere millimeters -
and the machine was powered on again.
This process was repeated over and over:
turn off, small adjustment, turn on, listen,
look, try again until it was just right.
The employees at the University's
Physics Demonstration Lab had to
make sure this demonstration - one of
their more dangerous - was correctly
calibrated because, well, that's just what
they do: Build, correct and perfect.
Buried in the basement of Dennison,
accessible through a second story
UTaircase or going through one of two
lecture halls, a team of three works daily
to imagine, build and perfect in-class
physics demonstrations and experiments.
From simply visualizing an electronic
field to loudly showing the effects of a
Tesla coil, the Physics Demonstration
Lab is used to increase learning and
occasionally awaken napping students in
physics classes everyday.
Buildingto educate
A demonstration is first thought out
and planned, then gets prototyped
for feasibility. If the project is deemed
successful, a first build is done and
sometimes second and third remakes are
required because of durability, weight
or myriad other concerns. Eventually it
is deemed classroom ready and added
to the catalogue. Even at this stage, the
demonstration can still be changed and
updated as feedback is received.
Laboratory Manager Warren Smith
and Lecture Demonstrators Monika
Wood and Matthew Jackson arrive one
hour before a class starts. They see the
schedule of demonstrations for the day
with many last minute additions from
professors and set up what's needed for
the first block of classes on movable carts.
While classes are in session, the
fhree set up experiments for the next
class, while working to fix and refine

demonstrations. The basementlaboratory
is a curious scientist's paradise. Situated
just yelling distance from the lecture
halls - in case anything goes wrong -
the large space consists of a small office
with computers, a large shelved storage
area and a workroom.
With the feel of the warehouse on
Discovery's "Mythbusters," the lab
has a large assortment of, well, almost
anything. Children's toys, saws, wires,
speakers of every size, all carefully
organized and put away.When a professor

University professors view the
demonstrations as one tool to help make
lessons stick in the minds of easily
distracted students. Students view the
experiments as a welcome reprieve from
PowerPoint presentations and another
way to help grasp a concept.
"Usually when you teach something,
some new idea, new concept, you want
the students to immediately come to grips
with it," Physics Prof. Gregory Tarle said.
"You want them to see that what you're
teachin' them has annlieatinns in real

about explaining the real world and,
especially in introductory classes, many
of the phenomena can be shown to
students directly.
Keeping it simple
Some demonstrations are essentially
unchanged from the 1900s, only getting
rebuilt when needed. Others are
frequently remade and created.
For Smith, who has been with the lab
for 18 years, an experiment can always be
improved - rebuilt, repainted, rethought.
However, he believes simplicity is key.
It is about properly meeting the needs
of both those who will use and see the
demonstration.
Smith said demonstrations are superior
to videos and simulations.
"There's just no replacement for the
real thing. It has an impact, a visceral
impact, upon all of your senses and your
body," Smith said.
While a demonstration may appear
simple in its final form, there is thought
that goes into every facet of its design:
the size and color of wiring, the speed of
the reaction and even colors that contrast
with blackboards.
"We just have a whole list of things
that we look at when we construct an
experiment that unless it meets all that
criteria, it's subject to rebuild at anytime,"
Smith said.
He said the perfect experiment is one
that clearly shows a single concept. Bored
students should be interested in what
happens, and it must be controllable
by professors. A good demonstration is
simple to understand and easy to see -
from both nearby and in the top row.
McKay said the physics faculty
embraces these demonstrations,
particularly in introductory classes.
He said when used properly the
demonstrations can be one of the best
ways to really drive home a point.
"Demonstrators are one of the ways
that we can send our students out
wanting to tell their roommate about
what happened in class today," McKay
said. "When you do that, it's not just a
piece of theater, because that kind of
memorable nature is learning. You stick
something in a person's brain in a way
that stays by giving it that framing."

For decades, designers have most-
ly stuck with this color palette in
their fall runway shows. In the fall
2013 season, however, designers
strayed away from this norm. Dries
Van Noten dressed his models in hot
pink and yellow outerwear. At Car-
ven, the color palette for outerwear
was baby blue, camel, pink and blush
- a trio noted as the "colors of the
season." Celine's fall show was noted
for its warmth, with one of the most
talked about pieces being a light
pink, rounded shoulder coat. This
color palette may, on the surface,
scream extreme femininity, but the
more masculine shapes balance out
what could be seen as paint colors
for a nursery room.
In Ann Arbor, we see this trend
in moderation, especially because
the trend of lighter-colored outer-
wear is very new and hasn't been
seen for the past decade. While the
coats themselves may be in darker
colors, accessories add lightness and
warmth to the outfits. In a sea of
black, puffy coats, colors that add a
certain lightness stand out.

Demonstrated learning
Typically used in large lecture halls -
where introductory science classes are
often held - the demonstrations break
up monotonous classes but also reinforce
learning in their own right.
In-class demonstrations can primarily
benefit learning in two ways, according
to Rachel Niemer, associate director for
the University's Center for Research
on Learning and Teaching. Aside from
providing a break during long lectures,
the demonstrations make students
actively think about the material instead
of passively ingesting it.

and visiting the physics lab. Many times,
they are just ordering an experiment

however,professorsarecallingwithanew

For members of the lab and the

encourages professors to come up with

Wednesday, November 20, 2013 // The Statement 2B

FOR WOMEN IN BUSINESS
IT'S MORE THAN A NUMBERS GAME
BYAKSHAY SETH

T"" he Ross School of Business has a
reputstion.
Secluded inside its impres-
sive, ultra-modern building on
Tappan Avenue, it's the place on
campus that typically comes to
mind when students hear the word "advan-
tage." The school is frequently ranked among
the top 10 bachelor's of business administra-
tion and master's of business administration
programs in the country, churning out grad-
uates that go on to find work in many of the
world's most recognizable firms.
Bloomberg reported that the average start-
ing salaries for fresh BBAs was a cool $62,727
and upwards of $110,000 for MBA students.
But even more impressive? Close to 90.5 per-
cent of the undergraduates the school pro-
duces receive a job offer immediately after
earning their degrees - an unprecedented
level of security that hasn't shaken in the face
of a wavering economy.
From a purely results-oriented standpoint,
the Business School is a well-recognized,
established school. But the notion of "advan-
tage" doesn't just imply success. It's hard to
overlook the fact that the large majority of
the students enrolled at the Business School
are white males, and have been since the
school's inception in 1924.
Though there's no doubt that progress has
been made, the fact of the matter is that cur-
rently only 35 percent of the 468 students in
the sophomore BBA class are female. That
number falls when considering the rest of the
Business School, where a little more than 32
percent of the 1,302 undergraduate students
are women, according to a Fall 2013 enroll-
ment report from the office of the Registrar.
But does an inequality in numbers imply
discrimination?
A recent New York Times case study took
an in-depth look at how sexual discrimina-
tion plays a role in the learning and teaching
environment women find themselves in at
the Harvard Business School. In addition to
focusing on sexism, the article turns the lens
on aggressive methods schools are taking to
diminish sexism, such as workshops to teach
women how to raise their hands to increase
participation and recording each lecture to
see how female professors could improve
teaching styles.
Business junior Sumana Palle, an execu-
tive board member for What the F magazine
and self-identifying "Bitch of the B-School,"
was quick to point out that a level of sexism
does not exist at Ross, but a clear dichotomy
in the type of udents who attend the school
creates tension.
Though many of the people she works with
are intelligent students, the source of the
problem is the few Business School students

that come in with the predetermined idea
that equality isn't assumed.
"Most of the students at Ross are inspir-
ing - they're some of the smartest people on
campus," she said. "But there's a vocal minor-
ity who are just awful people - douches who
come from very privileged families and want
to make sure everyone knows."
Palle said this sense of entitlement is sore-
ly felt in group projects, class discussions or,
for that matter, any personal interactions.
At certain instances in her time at the
Business School, Palle describes how she
often felt slighted and forced to finish many
of the menial tasks in classroom projects,
such as taking notes or writing summaries
of group meetings. It is a form of discrimi-
nation that, according to Palle, stems from a
clear divide in numbers and the perception of
roles, which require women to fight in order
to be heard.
The notion of an inclusive community
depends on the open-mindedness of the
people involved, independent of skin color or
gender. But, it's hard to ignore the statistics.
According to the registrar, only 18 of the
students currently registered as under-
graduates at Ross are Black while 859 are
white. The numbers get worse when looking
at Black women. Of the entire Ross student
body of 1,312, eight are Black women. Even
if it's indirect, the numbers influence the
school's culture.
In many interview workshops that precede
recruiting seasons, Palle recalls how the ses-
sions geared toward women pay special
attention to what type of makeup to wear and
how to best go about "prettying up." Though
Palle agrees these methods could be a way
for women to prepare for the realities of the
business world, she notes a prevalent level of
condescension.
"There is always this condescending tone,
and it's hard being a brown female, because
that affects the way people look at things,"
Palle said. "Sometimes it gets to the point
where I just think to myself, 'Why am I even
in this school?'
one of the select students preadmitted
to the Business School before her freshman
year, Palle described the contrast in the expe-
riences between her first year at the Univer-
sity and her second. Many of the on-campus
organizations she joined as a freshman were
progressive groups where the idea of "con-
tributing what you can" took precedence.
The change she saw as a student at Ross was
striking.
"The difference was bizarre," Palle said.
"When you'd walk into class, all you would
see are white male faces. That just hits you,
and automatically, you become self-conscious
and think 'Why am I here? What could I say,

what should I say? Will these people hate me
if I say these things?'"
An inclusive co mmunity
The most interesting aspect of the expe-
riences Palle describes is how they diverge
from those of another female student on cam-
pus. Business senior Tatiana Melamed, co-
president of the BBA population of Michigan
Business Women - an on-campus organiza-
tion that provides Business School students
with networking and educational opportuni-
ties - affirmed that some individuals at the
Business School are prejudiced, but never to
the point that she has felt targeted or discrim-
inated against.
Melamed said her initial interactions with
the older members of MBW helped her under-
stand the relevance of the community she
could foster should she choose to stick with
the Michigan Business Women. As a woman
working with other women, Melamed didn't
feel excluded.
The inclusion she gained in MBW, she said,
carried over into the rest of the classes and
projects she undertook as an undergraduate.
"I guess I never even viewed myself as dif-
ferent from other students, even going from
my time as a freshman in LSA to a sophomore
at Ross," Melamed said. "And even if I've felt
different for being a girl, it has been in a posi-
tive light, with other women - whether it's
professors who took me under their wing or
other classmates - looking out for me."
Like Palle, she referenced her time working
in group projects with teams heavily dominat-
ed in number by men. The difference in take-
aways is stark.
"I've never felt like my opinion has been mar-
ginalized, which could be because I am a very
assertive person," Melamed said. "And I think a
lot of my friends are in the same boat."
The key to success, Melamed clarified, is get-
ting women to take part in an inclusive commu-
nity as early as possible, so they have a chance
to find a support system they can lean on should
difficulty arise.
This support system, which Melamed found
in the form of MBW, establishes a space for
everyone involved to voice common concerns.
Even if those concerns aren't directly related to
sexism, the ability to confide in someone going
through the same experience is vital.
Palle pointed out how most of the women she
has met in the Business School have extremely
varied ideas on what is sexism. Many of her
friends, she noted, don't even realize when
they're being discriminated against. It's all a
matter of perspective.
"I think the saddest part is that so many
women don't even know when someone is being
sexist," Palle said. "We viewit differently."

Both Palle and Melamed seemed to mir-
ror one answer: Ultimately, a problem lies
in the numbers.
"A lot of people bring attention to how we
don't participate in class," Melamed said.
"When you consider the fact that only 30
percent of the students are female, it's easy
to see why you'd have more responses from
men than women."
A n ineq uality in num be rs
Historically, females have always been
underrepresented in higher stratums of the
business world, which remains consistent
despite a larger influx of women in the work-
force over the past few decades. Even though
institutions like the Business School are start-
ing to produce more female graduates than in
the past, the same graduates have a difficult
time climbing the corporate ladder.
According to recent reports by McKinsey
& Company, a major management consulting
firm, "Corporate America has a 'leaky' talent
pipeline; at each transition up the management
ranks, more women are left behind."
Even though only about half of new hires
are men, 63 percent of male new hires are pro-
moted to low-level managerial positions with
females in those positions dropping to 37 per-
cent. Moving a few steps further, 74 percent
of individuals promoted to vice president or
senior executive positions are male and just
14 percent of professionals on most executive
committees are female.
What is intriguing is the hyper-focused
efforts of many companies to increase diversity
on their executive boards. A yearly report by
McKinsey called "Women Matter" examines
the efforts of corporations across the world to
create more inclusive work environments. In
2012, researchers found that of the 235 firms
examined, 63 percent had more than 20 pro-
grams in place as part of their gender diver-
sity initiatives. Though there have been some
marked improvements, the results are less than
optimistic.
"In only8 percent of the biggest companies in
the survey did women account for more than a
quarter of the top jobs," the study states.
So what went wrong?
The report draws two large critiques of the
companies put under the lens: Not enough
sought government aid to facilitate diversi-
fication, and, more importantly, many of the
programs they instituted were prematurely
applied - a large push was made to promote
women into mid-level management positions,
but because some promoted women were
underqualified, profits dropped, making it
highly unlikely for the women given promo-
tions to rise further. Women were simply
hired to meet quotas within time and were

not given the proper recruiting consideration
an employee would otherwise deserve.
The results are eerily mirrored in a study
by Associate Finance Prof. Amy Dittmar, who
is also an asssociate dean for a Specialty Mas-
ter's Program. In the study, Dittmar and Prof.
Kenneth Ahern examined the impacts of a
law requiring public-limited Norwegian com-
panies to have at least 40 percent representa-
tion of women on their boards.
The researchers discovered that the stock
price of most firms noticeably dropped as a
result of the new policy, but they asserted the
drop had nothing to do with the gender of the
new board members.
Rather, the 40-percent constraint imposed
on the firms led them to hire underqualified
women to meet compliance, causing a drop
in performance and indirectly giving life
to the false perception that women do not
belong on boards.
"When firms were free to choose directors
before the rule, they tended to choose women
that were similar to men directors," Ditt-
mar and Ahern said in a press release for the
report. "This is consistent with the idea that
the large demand and small supply for women
directors after the adoption of the 40-percent
quota forced firms to choose directors that
they would not have chosen otherwise."
Life after business school might not be
intrinsically connected to gender imbalances
inside the Business School, but it's a thought-
provoking comparison: If there's one thing
uniting the firms examined in the reports
mentioned above, it's that most of them
acknowledged that an inequality in number
exists.
Solving a p ro ble m
According to Dittmar, the first step to solv-
ing the numbers issue is reevaluating current
progress. Dittmar said it is important to rec-
ognize the efforts of organizations like MBW,
but know there is more progress to be made.
"I think the most important thing is to cre-
ate an environment that students want to be
a part of," Dittmar said. "We are proud of the
culture here, but there's obviously work to be
done."
After the recent article in The New York
Times about Harvard Business School, MBW
hosted a panel for any Business School stu-
dent tovoice concerns if they had seen a simi-
lar level of sexism in their own classes.
"When a story like that comes out, it rip-
ples out," said Dittmar. "It was really impor-
tant that we confirm the same things weren't
going on at Ross."
Though most responses supported the claim
that sexism wasn't as visible at Ross, many of
the students in attendance felt that the exis-
tence of the problem, no matter where that
problem maybe, means it's time to have an open
dialogue, giving students who faced discrimi-
nation a chance to speak for themselves.
Dittmar explained that after the initial
panel, the professors left the room and let stu-
dents break off into groups to discuss possible
steps toward a solution. By and large, students
felt that the school had to take a more involved
approach in spreading awareness of the issue,

reaching outto the entire Business School com-
munity to instill the importance of diversity,
and getting a more varied group of possible
applicants interested in the school.
"We're definitely mindful of the divide in
the population," Tamra Talmadge-Anderson,
a public relations director at the Business
School, said. "But it's important to see how
willing we are to open doors to people at the
Business School."
For example, Ross is a founding member
of the Forte Foundation, an organization that
actively works to create scholarship opportu-
nities for women looking to enroll in business
schools. Since its formation, the foundation
has seen an overall 22-percent rise in MBA
enrollment at the institutions that sponsor it.
Good old boys dub
Though signs of progress are citable, some
concentrations of business, namely finance,
are slow to show signs of change. Emily Pare,
co-president of the graduate student portion
of MBW, referenced a recent corporate valu-
ation class she took in Detroit through the
Business School, where there were approxi-
mately three or four women out of more than
30 total students.
"It's not one of those fields women typi-
cally go into," Pare said. "Even corporate
finance and investment banking, definitely,
is an industry that is male-dominated.
I think there were two women total
last year that were recruiting for
investment banking."
She said that it's one
of those few pockets in
the industry that has
avoided change for an
extremely long time.
She paused for
a moment when
asked why she
thought that was
the case.
"I guess it
requires a thick
skin," she finally
said, uncertain.
"I don't think
it's that women
are uninterested
in it. I think the
culture in place
there doesn't fit
them very well.
From the outside,
it's hard to tell specifi-
cally what that culture
is, but you're definitely
going to have those nights
where all the guys go out,
which kind of creates the 'good-
old-boys club' idea and ostracizes
women."
Overwhelmingly, the exclusivity
spawns a lack of understanding in
both directions: Women often don't
know how to approach the work
environment at large investment
banks and the men there don't know
how to make an inclusive environment.

According to Pare, the answer is creat-
ing a reliable mentorship program and hav-
ing women already in the field or who have
already worked in the field willing to help out
others that want to join.
The easiest place to find those mentors
should be the faculty at the Business School,
but it is heavily skewed in favor of men in the
finance subdivision. Of the 27 professors, asso-
ciate professors and visiting scholars listed in
the department's staff page, two are female.
Despite the Business School boasting that
50 percent of its faculty leaders are women,
the inequality at lower levels needs to be
changed.
Accordingto a recentstudy conducted by
Prof. James Westphal, as more women
and minorities find a place on execu-
tive committees, few are able to
attain the elite "inner circle
status" that comes from serv-
ing on multiple boards. The
reason: the lack of mentoring
they receive from white male
executives already on the
payroll.
It's not fair to say that
male faculty members are

unable to guide female students. But as
Melamed stated, it has to be acknowledged
that students are more likely to confide
in people who have gone through similar
problems. The varying perceptions female-
students have of the Business School is a tes-
tament to why the issue can't be approachd in
one way, or following the course of Norway's
40-percent rule and prematurely admitting
more female students.
"We can't just blindly throw money at the
problem and hope for it to magically disap-
pear," Pare said. "It's never that simple."
