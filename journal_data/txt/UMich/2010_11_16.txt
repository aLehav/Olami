Daily News Editor
At its meeting later this week,
the University's Board of Regents
is expected to
approve a fire-
works show for
the Dec. 11 Big
Chill at the Big
Moose match-
up against
Michigan Stat ANS
University.
In a commu- Covern h
nication sent n
to the Univer-
sity's regents,
Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and chief
financial officer, wrote that fire-
works would be displayed during
player introductions and a10-min-
ute show at the end of the game
would be choreographed to music.
Both displays would be performed
from the rooftops of the new sky-
box towers at the stadium.

Additionally, Slottow wrote,
fireworks would be launched for
approximately five seconds each
time Michigan nets a goal. These
fireworks would be set off directly
from the field.
No informationabouthow much
the show would cost was provid-
ed in the communication to the
regents. However, Slottow wrote
that fireworks display company,
ACE Pyro, LLC, has been selected
to manage the event, if the show is
approved by the regents and passes
a safety and security screening by
the University's fire marshal.
UNIVERSITY TO REQUEST

STATE APPROPRIATIONS
The University's Board of
Regentsis also expected to approve
a letter to be sent to the state's bud-
get director, Bob Emerson.
The letter, signed by University
President Mary Sue Coleman, is
sent to the state each year and out-
lines the University's commitment
to cost containment as well as the
economic impact the University
has on the state.
In the draft letter, submitted to
the regents by University Provost
Philip Hanlon, Coleman wrote

Nobel laureate to speak at

Astronomer Sandra

By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Though the University's win-
ter commencement speaker isn't
the President of the United States,

University President Mary Sue
Coleman said she is excited for
Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman
to speak at next month's ceremo-
ny.
Kahneman, who won the
2002 Nobel Prize in econom-
ics, will address the graduates
and receive a Doctor of Science
degree. Astronomer Sandra Faber
will also be awarded a Doctor
of Sciences degree and Charles
Munger, vice-chairman of Berk-
shire Hathaway and a University

alum, will be presented a Doctor
of Laws degree.
in an exclusive interview with
The Michigan Daily last week,
Coleman disclosed the honorary
degree recipients. The selections,
which were made public yester-
day in the agenda for the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents monthly
meeting, will need to be approved
by the regents when they meet on
Thursday at the University's Flint
campus.
Kahneman won the Nobel

Prize for his work in prospect
theory, which he developed as a
visiting scientist at the Univer-
sity from 1965 to 1967 with Amos
Tversky, who received his Ph.D.
from the University in 1964.
Prospect theory explains how
individuals make choices in situ-
ations where they have to decide
between two choices that are
risky - like in the case of a finan-
cial investment.
Coleman said Kahneman and

Hughes lauds Ross center
before Senate Assembly

Athletic dept. official
says student-athletes
under more pressure
than student body
By CAITLIN HUSTON.
Daily StaffReporter
Phil Hughes, director of the
academic success program,
praised the role of the Ross Aca-
demic Center in addressing the
needs of student-athletes in a talk

to the University's leading faculty
governing body yesterday.
Hughes told the Senate Assem-
bly that he feels student-athletes
are under greater daily pressure
than the general student body,
due to the amountof time devoted
to practice, game travel and other
educational athletic courses. But
because of the system in place at
the academic center, Hughes said
student-athletes have been able
to maintain high academic stan-
dards.
"The student-athletes are
hanging in there, and they're

competing at a very high level
on par with the general student
body," Hughes said.
Referring to statistics on
his PowerPoint presentation,
Hughes said based on a six-year
period beginning in 2003 stu-
dent-athletes had an 80-percent
graduation rate compared to the
90-percent graduation rate of the
general student body.
When athletes first come to
the University, Hughes said the
academic center offers them aca-
demic support, including help

Many wide-eyed students
on campus have heard the
myth that if your roommate
dies, all your professors have
to give you A's for the semester.
But before rushing out to buy
a virtually untraceable poi-
son in hopes of becoming an
Angell Scholar, students might
want to consider that the myth
could be false.
There's no irrefutable policy
at the University that states
whether the myth is true or
false, but University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald told The
Michigan Daily that it is sim-
ply a myth.
"That is not true," Fitzger-
ald said. "That is a myth."
Though the myth is false,
the notion that a student will
get all A's if their roommate
dies has become lore at cam-
puses across the country, even
CRIME NOTES

serving as the plot for the 1998
movie "Dead Man on Cam-
pus."
Where the myth originated
at the University is difficult to
pinpoint, but students often
associate it with a different
myth that claims that if a stu-
dent is hit by a bus, he or she
would have his or her tuition
waived - a notion that is also
false.
However, in the interview,
Fitzgerald said he would
encourage any student who is
experiencing a stressful situ-
ation to take advantage of the
counseling services offered on
campus.
"We would certainly
encourage students who find
themselves in that situation or
any other stressful situation
to seek out the counselors at
(Counseling and Psychologi-

cal Services) for help in deal-
ing with something like that,"
Fitzgerald said.
CAPS services include coun-
seling for both individuals and
groups, psychiatric evalua-
tions, assistance in monitoring
medication and a suicide pre-
vention program. Addition-
ally, CAPS offers walk-in crisis
services for urgent crises like
sexual assault, a campus cri-
sis response team and a wide
array of outreach activities
and workshops.
According to the organi-
zation's website, CAPS has
a diverse staff with wide-
ranging expertise - including
clinical social workers, psy-
chiatrists and psychologists
- who work with students to
manage mental health con-

1000 PITCHES

way to make a positive impact."
Mehta added that the 1,000
Pitches competition is going
strong and is proving to be the
"hub where a lot of entrepreneur
activity happens."
According to the live update
on the competition's website,
there are 2,324 pitches as of
last night. Mehta said this num-
ber already exceeds last year's
record.
"We want quantity because it
creates virility in the competi-
tion," he said.
He said that there's been was
talk of turning 1,000 Pitches into
one million pitches for America.
At yesterday's Diag day, 1,000
Pitches hosted a station that fea-
tured students who had already
submitted their ideas. The event
also had two large plastic globes
where students could write their
ideas about how to make the
world a better place.
Engineering junior Andrew
Brehm pitched an idea aimed at
purifying water without having
to use fuel or energy.
The idea is to create a "cheap,
easy to make, easy to distribute
water purifier for hot, dry cli-
mates," he said.
He explained that dirty
water would be in one container
underneath a black surface. The
dirty water would be evaporated
by the sun's heat, and the evapo-
rated purified water would then

drip into a separate container.
"This will help prevent the
spread of disease and ensure that
people are always drinking clean
water," Brehm said. "It's also
going to be very cheap to make
because it'll be mostly made of
plastic parts."
Business sophomore Julia
Shi pitched an idea for a mobile
application that uses a Global
Positioning Satellite to deter-
mine restaurant options near the
location of the mobile device and,
then provide prices, average wait
times for dining in and carrying
out and restaurant capacity.
"This application would be
helpful, for example, if you are
a college student, because some-
times you have awkward 30
minute pads of time between
classes," Shi said.
She said the application would
be free for students but that she
would make a profit by hav-
ing local restaurants pay for ad
space.
Feeding off of college stu-
dents' need for food, Business
sophomore Han Zhang pitched
a similar idea, which would use
mobile GPS technology to send
the user's location to a restau-
rant to have food delivered to
wherever the student is located.
"This way you can literally get
food from wherever you are,"
Zhang said. "You don't have to
be at a given location."
LSA freshman Harry Hant-
man pitched multiple ideas,
one of which was a website and
phone application called "Paths

From Last Night."
The program would record
different points of one's loca-
tion at 30-second to 5-minute
intervals, mapping the user's
movement. He said the applica-
tion could have a variety of uses
and could be posted on social
network sites like Facebook or
Twitter.
"You can post your path from
last night and say 'this is a great
path as a runner' or 'look how
wasted I was last night and I
just did this and it was really
stupid,"' Hantman said. "It con-
nects the different paths you
take from one place to another."
Business and Engineering
sophomore Prateek Garg pitched
an idea of heated sneakers for
the cold Michigan winters.
His idea involves a magnet
and coil inside the shoe to cre-
ate currents that would produce
heat.
"The more you walk the
warmer your feet get," Garg said.
"So in the winter your feet won't
get as cold."
LSA freshman Becca Weisz
pitched an idea that aims to help
users resist the urge to text while
driving. Her application, called
"driving mode" would require
a car to have the ability to sync
and would send out an automat-
ed, personalized text response to
any message received while the
car is in drive.
"Basically what driving mode
is, is the solution to texting while
driving," Weisz said. "The laws
aren't a solution."

Tversky worked very closely
together and added that Tversky
would've also been awarded the
Nobel Prize had he not died in 1996.
"(Khaneman) came here
between 1965 and 1967 to do a
visiting professorship and start-
ed collaborating with one of our
recent Ph.D.s, Amos Tversky,
and they did this work together
and published together for a long
time. But Amos died, otherwise he
would've gotten the Nobel Prize
with Daniel," Coleman said.
"It's very wonderful, and I'm
very happy that he's going to be
the speaker," she continued.
Kahneman was born in Pales-

tine in 1934, but spent his child-
hood in France where he and his
family escaped the Nazis dur-
ing the Holocaust. After the war,
Kahneman returned to Israel
before he eventually immigrated
to the United States in 1958. Cur-
rently, he is a professor emeritus
at Princeton University. Faber
is a professor of Astronomy and
Astrophysics at the University of
California, Santa Cruz. In 1976,
Faber helped to develop the Faber-
Jackson Theory, which is used to
estimate the distance between
galaxies.
Coleman said Faber is a world-
renowned astronomer, adding
"she is very distinguished."
Munger, the third individual to
be awarded an honorary degree at
winter commencement, is worth

over $1 billion and donated $3
million to the University's Law
School in 2007. Munger has come
to campus a number of times to
speak, visiting most recently last
September.
In the interview, Coleman
called Munger, "one of the world's
leading investors" for his work at
Berkshire Hathaway alongside
Warren Buffett.
Honorary degree recipients are
chosen by the University's Honor-
ary Degree Committee, which is
chaired by Rackham Dean Janet
Weiss. The committee reviews
nominations for the degree recipi-
ents submitted by students, fac-
ulty and staff.
Winter commencement will
be take place at 2 p.m. on Dec. 19, 4

Connecticut liquor wholesalers

The popular drinks have been

Four Loko is made by Chicago-

U.K. compromises
in ex-Guantanamo
detainee lawsuit
Britain's government has agreed
to a deal with a group of ex-Guan-
tanamo Bay detainees who were
suing the U.K. for alleged complic-
ity in their torture.
Prime Minister David Cam-
eron's office said in a statement
yesterday that the details would
be announced to lawmakers on
Tuesday.
Government officials declined
to discuss the settlement in

advance - or confirm whether it
would pay compensation - citing
a confidentiality agreement.
A total of 12 men were suing
Britain over claims they were
mistreated. They include Binyam
Mohamed, who alleges he was
abused while held in Pakistan in
2002.
In July, Cameron said a judge-
led inquiry would be set up to
examine the handling of torture
overseas by Britain's intelligence
agencies.
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.
Illegal immigrants
get in-state tuition
The California Supreme Court
weighed in yesterday on the politi-
cally charged immigration fray
when it ruled that illegal immi-
grants are entitled to the same
tuition breaks offered to in-state
high school students to attend pub-
lic colleges and universities.
While the ruling applies only
to California, the case was closely
watched nationally because nine
other states, including New York.
and Texas, have similar laws.
Republican congressmen Lamar
S. Smith of Texas and Steve King
of Iowa filed a so-called friends of
the court brief urging that illegal
immigrants be denied the reduced
rate.
A unanimous state Supreme
Court, led by politically conserva-
tive Justice Ming Chin, said the
California provision was constitu-
tional because U.S. residents also
had access to the reduced rates.

that she understands the state's
current fiscal constraints but
that investing in higher educa-
tion is essential to Michigan's
revitalization.
"We respectfully ask that the
state reinvest in higher educa-
tion by increasing our appro-
priation by 2.6 percent in fiscal
year 2012, in order to cover the
projected 1.6 percent increase
in the Detroit CPI and the one
percent in lost state scholarship

The 1-percent loss in state

REGENTS TO CONSIDER
PARTIAL MLB, SCHOOL OF
EDUCATION RENOVATIONS
In two separate communica-
tions to the University's Board of
Regents, Slottow also requested
a total of $3.4 million to finance
the renovation of parts of the
Modern Language Building and
the School of Education building.
The first request, which seeks
$2 million from the College of
Literature, Science and the Arts,
would finance renovations to
the MLB's basement and second
floor.

In his letter to the regents,
Slottow wrote that the renova-
tion would include repurposing
the former Language Resource
Center - now located in the
North Quadrangle academic
building - to meet the needs
of LSA's Instructional Support
Services Media Center, which is
currently housed in leased space
off campus.
Additionally, the project
would repurpose space in the
basement of the MLB to house
the Department of Screen Arts

which are currently located in

If approved, the project would
be completed during the sum-
mer of 2011.
In his second request, Slottow
asked the regents to approve a
$1.4 million project that would
renovate a vacated storage space
in the School of Education to
create the Brandon Professional
Center and Archive.
Slottow described the new
space as "a 21st-century educa-
tion library" that would house
a wide array of resources that
could be used by students for
studying professional practices
in education.
The project would be funded
by a private gift, investment
income and School of Educa-
tion resources, Slottow wrote. If
approved, the project would be
completed in fall 2011.

DPS official says
authorities will issue
a warning to delivery
restaurants
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
A pizza delivery man was
robbed on Friday after being
called to a fake North Campus
address, University Police report-
ed.
Department of Public Safe-
ty spokeswoman Diane Brown
said that at around 8:15 p.m. on
Friday night, the delivery man
was searching for the address

on Bishop Avenue when he was
approached by a hooded man who
"brandished what was perceived
tobe a gun."
"The delivery person later fig-
ured out that it was not a real
gun," Brown said.
The delivery man did not have
any money with him, but his
iPhone was stolen by the perpe-
trator. Following the robbery, the
suspect fled, and the driver called
the police about 20 minutes after-
wards, according to Brown.
"It appears to be a calculated
crime," Brown said. "It wasn't just
random."
The suspect is described as
being in his mid-twenties, dark-
skinned and about 5 feet 9 inches
tall. Currently there are no leads.

Brown said in light of the inci-
dent officials will issue some type
of warning to local delivery res-
taurants.
"I think there's some out-
reach that will happen, if it hasn't
already, with the pizza places that
deliver because that's who will be
at risk," she said.
Similar events have not
occurred on campus in recent
years, according to Brown, though
they have happened in other parts
of Ann Arbor.
"We haven't had reports of
this sort of thing on campus but
it is something that pizza delivery
people are trained about on a reg-
ular basis," she said."I know there
have been reports of these (types
of crimes) elsewhere in the city."


MARIJUANA

Among the key issues addressed
in the proposed ordinance are the
requirements that dispensaries
cannot stand within 1,000 feet of
schools and cannot extend their
business outside the premises.
The ordinance also establishes
rules for dispensary operations,
including no smoking on the prem-
ises, no drive-in dispensaries and a
restriction on customers under the
age of 18 without an accompanying
parent or guardian.
Since the Oct. 6 preliminary
reading, city officials made a series
of additions to the ordinance that
elaborate on certain "reasonable
restrictions" regarding the growth
and use of medical marijuana.
These additions include a man-

date that dispensary owners sign
an annual zoning compliance per-
mit as well as a series of guidelines
for medical marijuana in single-
family homes.
In requesting a postponement,
council member Marcia Higgins
(D-Ward 4) said council members
need additional time to consider
the proposed changes before vot-
ing on the issue. With Higgins'
postponement approved, council is
set to vote on the ordinance at its
Dec. 22 meeting.
Addressing council at the public
forum portion of last night's meet-
ing, Charmie Gholson - manag-
ing editor of a quarterly marijuana
advocacy publication entitled The
Midwest Cultivator - said she was
concerned that the ordinance is far
too restrictive and will encourage
retaliation.
"If it's too prohibitive, you're

going to have ...unintended conse-
quences," Gholson told the council.
In an interview after her pre-
sentation, Gholson added that
she's concerned the ordinance
and its enforcement will amount
to a ban akin to the prohibition of
alcohol during the 1920s and early
1930s.
"My job isto remind people that
prohibitiondoesn'twork," shesaid.
In contrastto Gholson, longtime
city resident and self-described
"lifetime non-marijuana user"
Thomas Partridge praised the
ordinance, saying he's in favor of
harsher regulations to keep medi-
cal marijuana from people who
will abuse it.
"Many marijuanausers ... ignore
the very serious perils of lighting
up," Partridge said at the meeting.
"It's important that City Council
keep this in mind."

with tutoring and class schedul-
ing, as well as general time man-
agement skills. The center also
tracks the academic progress of
the athletes, Hughes said.
With the academic center
open from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. most
weekdays, Hughes said he has
seen student-athletes use the
facility regaslgrly, with an influx
of students coming to the center
for tutoring in the evenings.
Hughes added that because
the students are representa-
tives of the University's Athletic
Department, he feels the cen-
ter is important in shaping the
students' decision-making and
overall image.
"Student-athletes have to feel
connected to the University," he
said. "They have to feel that the
University is connected to them,
and therein is the hope that
they'll make better and more
ethical decisions about their
behavior."
Addressing a question from a
member of the assembly, Hughes
said he realizes that some ath-
letes prioritize their sport above
academics. He said the structure
in place at the academic center
helps the students understand
the importance of their academ-
ic life as well.
Robert Frost, an associate
professor in the School of Infor-
mation and a member of the Sen-
ate Assembly, said though he
thinks the resources at the cen-
ter are helpful, he is concerned
about the segregation it cre-
ates between student-athletes
and the general student body in
the classroom. Hughes echoed
Frost's sentiments, saying that
he was also concerned about
that disconnect.
In an interview after Hughes's
talk, Anna Bielinska, an assis-
tant professor in the Universi-
ty's Medical School, said she was
concerned about the academic
center's amount of control over
the lives of student-athletes.
"(The program) helps the
young person to pass from the
first year to the next but not to
get a personality developed or a
habit of self studies," Bielinska
said. "It's completelyguided from
.7:30 in the morning. Somebody
watches him, what he does."
Hughes said though the cen-
ter does heavily guide and moni-
tor students initially, they are
gradually weaned from the sys-
tem. He added that the academ-
ics of an athlete must be tracked
to determine whether they are
able to play during practice and
games.

TECH TRANSFER AT'U'
LAUNCHES NEW
BUSINESSES
Ken Nisbet, executive director
of Tech Transfer at the Universi-
ty, also spoke at yesterday's meet-
ing highlighting the importance
and success of Tech Transfer ini
helping faculty commercialize
their research.
Nisbet said the Tech Trans-
fer program is composed of two
parts - one to help faculty with
the licensing of their technologi-
cal inventions and another that
searches for start-up businesses.
He said the licensing program
also conducts market research
to find companies that would be
interested in adopting faculty
inventions.
Nisbet said he believes the pro-
gram is doing very well, adding
that the program placed 91 tech-
nologies with entities in 2009.
In 2008, the program placed 78
technologies with entities.
Past inventions licensed
through the Tech Transfer
program, Nisbet said, include
MedImmune, which made the
FluMist influenza nasal vaccine,
Sakti3, an advanced battery lab,
and Health Media, an online
health coaching program.
He added that Tech Transfer
is important for the success of
faculty inventions as well as for
the reputation of the University,
as high-profile commercialized
inventions may attract new fac-
ulty to campus.
Currently housed in the
28-building North Campus
Research Complex, Nisbet said
he is excited that the program
is in a collaborative space with
other researchers. As the pro-
gram launches other start-up
companies through its business
accelerator, he said he is glad the
NCRC willibe home to those com-
panies.
The Tech Transfer program
also contains the Michigan Ven-
ture Center, which was estab-
lished a year ago to develop
start-up businesses based on
technological inventions from
faculty, Nisbet said.
Nisbet said. the center fea-
tures a "Mentor-in-Residence"
program in which experienced
entrepreneurs help assess wheth-
er various inventions are viable
for the market.
The center gives students the
opportunity to participate in a
summer internship program,
in which they learn about the
licensing and development pro-
cess and after which they may
continue working for the Tech
Transfer Center.

Combating mental illness
'U' should increase resources and funding to CAPS
he mental health of students is a serious concern on col-
lege campuses. College students simultaneously manage
a heavy course load, busy social lives, internships and
extracurricular activities - and they do this all while adjusting
to life as an adult. The combination of so many expectations and
responsibilities can lead to depression and anxiety. This is by no
means a new problem, but studies show that the number of stu-
dents with mental health issues has increased in recent years,
prompting increased need for a University response. The Univer-
sity must respond to students'needs and devote more resources to
developing and improving systems that help students cope.

According to a Nov. 10 article in the
Daily, the National College Health Assess-
ment from this past spring found the
the number of students with feelings of
depression, anxiety, stress and sleep trou-
bles have risen from previous years. This
fact worries health officials including
Director of University Health Services Dr.
Robert Winfield and Tim Davis, associate
director of the University's Counseling
and Psychological Services - more com-
monly referred to as CAPS. To address this
problem, UHS is working to start routine
student mental health evaluations. CAPS
is attempting to increase the size of its
staff to accommodate students' needs.
Officials are unsure of the reason for these
recent increases in reported mental health
problems. But it's possible that the decreas-
ing stigma surrounding counseling for the
stress of college life has contributed to the
rise. More students are also coming into the
University with mental health diagnoses
and may require continual assistance dur-
ing their time here. In addition, students
must also adjust to and deal with Michi-
gan's competitive academic environment
- an environment that creates high levels
of stress. The University should be aware of
this concern and ensure that its students are
well-informed about where to seek help and
advice when they feel overwhelmed.

Mental illnesses often go undiagnosed
and untreated, which can allow a small,
solvable problem to grow into something
potentially unmanageable. UHS's plan to
expand mental health screenings should
help decrease how often these problems go
unnoticed. This is a crucial service - and
students should make use of it if they begin
to feel unreasonably stressed, depressed or
otherwise unwell.
Though diagnosing an issue is important,
it's only half of the battle. The next part of
the process is treatment. Students at the
University are fortunate to have the CAPS
program available, but they need to be able
to access it. Currently, CAPS simply can't
handle the influx of students who need its
services - there are too many students seek-
ing counseling and not enough employees or
space to accommodate everyone in a timely
manner. The University must make sure that
CAPS has the necessary resources to ade-
quately meet all students' needs.
Mental illness as a result of stress is
an unfortunate reality for college stu-
dents, but it doesn't need to cripple stu-
dents' functioning. The University should
increase funding and resources to CAPS
and encourage students to participate in
screenings. It should do everything pos-
sible to help students - and make them
aware that help is available.

involving nine Central Washington
University students who were hospi-
talized upon excessive consumption
of the caffeinated malt liquor. In the
caseofthe 14-year-old, the loth-grader
testified that she had been drinking
a mixture of Four Loko and rum, and
later Hennessy at a motel room outside
of Detroit. But there were numerous
factors that contributed to this tragic
assault - including the girl's age, the
large quantity of alcohol consumed
and the actions of the men who alleg-
edly assaulted her. To single out Four
Loko as the main villain is a rash and
reactionary decision by the state.
Across the country, Central Wash-
ington University President James
Gaudino banned Four Loko from his
campus. Administrators at Central
Washington hsave heavily discouraged
use of the drink. And while Gaudino
and MLCC Commissioner Patrick
Gagliardi will tell you that their bans
are about protecting your health, take
their words with a grain of salt.
The regulators want it to seem
like they're doing students a favor
by curtailing irresponsible behavior.
But the ban's effects on the drinking
habits of University students will be
immaterial. To meet the desire for
caffeinated alcohol, many students
will simply resort to purchasing
energy and alcohol drinks separately
and then combining them, producing

products are more dangerous than
other drinks that combine alcohol and
caffeine. The mass hysteria created by
the media and regulators in response
to a product that the Food and Drug
Administration has yet to complete
testing is premature and ill advised.
In fact, figures show that Four Loko
is a less dangerous alternative to the
practice of combining alcoholic and
caffeinated drinks independently.
The volume of alcohol in Four
Loko is comparable to the amount
in five shots of vodka. Holding this
level of alcohol constant, mixing a
regular can of Red Bull with five
shots of vodka would result in a caf-
feine-to-alcohol ratio that is 1.3 times
greater than Four Loko. Four Loko
isn't especially dangerous. The fact is
overconsumption of anything can be
hazardous to one's health. Modera-
tion is the best policy.
But health concerns about Four
Loko aren't the only figures that fail
to hold water. According to a Nov. 4
release from the Michigan Department
of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth,
Four Loko's "packaging is often mis-
leading" - though the body offers no
facts to back up this claim. But in fact,
a glance at a can of Four Loko shows
that its alcohol by volume warning of
12 percent is prominently displayed
in large letters - the largest font size
allowed by federal law, according to

The MLCC's Four
Loko ban is rash
and reactionary.
And while I would pass on any offer
to drink Four Loko, that doesn't mean
that everyone should be required to.
The move of two government regula-
tors on the MLCC to reduce the choices
of a state of millions of people with no
data or testimony to back their deci-
sion amounts to nothing but the low-
est form of government paternalism.
A panel of two individuals should not
have the power to turn their personal
preferences into moral imperatives
that require imposition through force.
With a ban in place, Gagliardi and
liquor regulators are reducing the
choices for Four Loko aficionados
to spend their money as they see fit.
Without a shred of scientific evidence
to back up their claims, the rash and
reactionary government decision to
ban caffeinated alcohol needs to be
reconsidered.

The power of nuclear plants



Last May, I visited a friend at Cornell Uni-
versity for their annual Slope Day event and
saw hip-hop artist Drake perform. That same
spring, my friends at Syracuse University were
graced by the up-and-coming superstar's pres-
ence at their MayFest, while another friend at
Brown University enjoyed performances by
MGMT and Snoop Dogg at Brown's annual
Spring Weekend.
Since the University has such an early end to
the academic year, there was a noticeable group
of Wolverines in attendance at Slope Day. As
we all discussed our summer plans and waited
for Drake to start his set, the same thought was
on everyone's mind: we could do this so much
better - if only we had such an event.
Ann Arbor isn't generally a stop on the tours
of the majority of headline acts. Artists who
choose to perform in Michigan typically stop
in Detroit or at The Palace of Auburn Hills.
For an act to play Detroit one night and Ann
Arbor the following night doesn't make any
sense for an artist. Between the overlapping of
ticket markets and the current struggling state
of Michigan's economy, artists don't have any
financial incentive to perform in both Detroit
and Ann Arbor. This is an unfortunate reality
that University students looking to attend con-
certs have had to accept. With the accessibility
of mass transit into Detroit lagging far behind
other major cities, traveling from Ann Arbor is
often limited to driving or taking a costly taxi.
For many students, these options are simply
implausible - and the void of music continues.
But what if there is a way to make perform-
ing in Ann Arbor not purely a business decision?
What if there was a systematic way to make see-
ing music easier for all Michigan students? If
the University of Michigan, like Cornell, Syra-
cuse, Brown and countless other schools around
the country, created its own music event, more
major artists would perform in Ann Arbor. An
annual, school-run concert would transform
Ann Arbor from its role as second fiddle to
Detroit on the musical spectrum, to a city with
a legitimate musical event with a massive and
enthusiastic student audience.

Students who previously struggled with the
logistics of traveling to Detroit would have
the opportunity to see their favorite artists
without having to worry about the difficul-
ties of transportation. The economy in Ann
Arbor would also stand to benefit because a
music event would bring an influx of people to
the city and to its local restaurants, bars and
other establishments. But most importantly, an
annual music event would give major musical
acts a definitive reason to put the University
down as a stop on their tours. I'm confident our
student body would make it worth the while of
any entertainer who comes to perform on cam-
pus.
Modesty aside, students at the University
are pretty good at cultivating some of the most
memorable experiences. We're the school that
puts on one of the most exciting athletic spec-
tacles for seven or eight Saturdays every fall.
We're the school that had the president of the
United States as its commencement speaker
this spring. We're the school that celebrates St.
Patrick's Day not just on the day itself, but also
on the Saturday before. Simply put, students at
the University are masters of magnifying every
experience to the grandest scale possible. This
attitude needs to transcend into the produc-
tion of an annual campus-wide music event.
over the summer, my friends and I routine-
ly talked about various aspects of our college
experiences. When we came upon the subject
of spring concerts, my friends all asked, "Who
performed at Michigan's spring concert?" and
not, "Does Michigan have a spring concert?"
Like my friends did this summer, the Univer-
sity student body should expect the University
to create a signature music event. As a univer-
sity, we have proved throughout our rich his-
tory that we are capable of almost anything.
An annual music event would not only give
students a better opportunity to see major art-
ists perform, but also would establish another
memorable event as part of the impressive fab-
ric of the University.

arly this month, German citi-
zens gathered in the thou-
sands to protest trains and
trucks entering
their country from
France. The con-
tents of the trains
in question was
reprocessed nucle-
ar waste. It seems
that Germans
were upset with
their government's
recent decision to JOE
extend the life of SUGIYAMA
their 17 nuclear
power plants by 12
years. The exten-
sion is under fire because it moves
Germany further from its original
plan for its nuclear power plants - to
have all plants phased out by 2021.
Government officials have
responded to protests - which have
become commonplace in the past
few years - by stating that they cur-
rently don't have a solid alternative
to nuclear power and shutting down
current plants would leave the coun-
try without a reliable energy supply.
But the protesters aren't buying this
excuse. They seem to believe that
the next Chernobyl disaster is right
around the corner.
It's easy to understand the protest-
ers' concerns. Nuclear plant accidents
aren't exactly something that can
be taken care of overnight. The 1986
Chernobyl disaster, for instance, dev-
astated a large region of Europe after
a reactor failed and released a large
plume of radioactive fallout. It eventu-
ally forced more than 350,000 people
to relocate because of unsafe levels of
radiation. This is obviously an unac-
ceptable result, but that is the most
extreme example ofa plant failure ever.
Currently, the U.S. has the largest
number of nuclear power plants in the
--the
podium

world - but it hasn't constructed a
new plant in nearly 37 years. Obama's
cap-and-trade plan includes a provi-
sion to set aside $36 billion for the
construction of nuclear facilities. But
due to our current economic situa-
tion, there hasn't been a push to raise
taxes to create new plants. According
to a Nov. 11 CNN article, people like
Whitney Stanco - an analyst at the
Washington Research Group - sug-
gested that using the money as a loan
instead of grants could jumpstart
the plan, which would reduce our
nation's dependence on fossil fuels.
Even if the $36 billion in federal
subsidies is granted to power com-
panies, there's still reluctance to put
more workers and civilians at risk
of a major accident like Chernobyl.
But Chernobyl should be looked at
as an anomaly rather than the norm.
Though there have been similar acci-
dents since 1986, no failures have
occurred on the same scale as the
Chernobyl incident. A properly main-
tained and managed nuclear power
plant offers many solutions to our
current energy, environmental and
economic problems.
The capital cost associated with
nuclear power plants comprises a
large majority of total cost. Uranium
is a fairly common element in the
Earth's crust. One pound of it has
roughly the same energy content as
2 million pounds of coal, meaning we
need much less fuel to run a nuclear
plant than a coal-fired power plant.
Less fuel means lower production
costs - even when considering the
price of the enrichment process.
The environmental impacts can't
be ignored, either. Coal-fired power
plants release large amounts of carbon
dioxide, sulfur - resulting in acid rain
- and fly ash. On the other hand, the
byproducts of nuclear plants include
radioactive waste, but this waste is on

a much smaller scale than the outputs
of coal plants. With recent advance-
ments in technology, scientists and
nuclear engineers are finding better
ways to reprocess this waste and have
the potential to make nuclear plants
self-sufficient in terms of fuel.
Nuclear power plants would
reduce our dependence on foreign
fossil fuels, increasing our nation's
ability to operate on our own terms.
In times of turmoil abroad, it's vital
that we become an energy-indepen-
dent nation.
Nuclear power
is a sensible
energ alternative.
The German protesters seem to
have a "not in my backyard" mental-
ity. What they aren't grasping is that
nuclear energy is one of the most
cost-effective and environmentally
friendly forms of power. The U.S.
should look at the brighter side of
this form of energy - lower energy
cost, lower carbon footprint and less
dependence on foreign fuels.
Using nuclear power seems like a
no-brainer when considering all the
positive benefits. Though the cons
can't be thrown to the wind, safer
practices and new technologies that
prevent accidents and reduce radio-
active waste justify the risks. Like it
or not, nuclear power is going to be
a part of our future. It would be best
for our country and environment if
we embraced it.

Michigan football coach Rich
Rodriguez dodged questions Mon-
day afternoon
about the signifi- NOTEBOOK
cance of potential
wins over Wisconsin or Ohio State in
regards to his job security.
But he didn't downplaythe impor-
tance victories could hold for his
upperclassmen. Saturday's game
against Wisconsin will be the senior
class's final home game.
"These guys - our seniors and our
juniors - have beenthrough an awful
lot the last couple of years," Rodri-
guez said at his weekly press confer-
ence, referring to back-to-back losing
seasons in his first two years as head
coach. "They've heard as much stuff
as anybody. I'm proud because when
I see them, when we're around them,
they've been totally focused and tun-
nel-visioned on doing what we tell
them to do.
. "In the next couple of years, they
can come back and say,'We were the
ones who got it right when it needed
to get right.'"
Rodriguez said the Wolverines
would honor their seniors at the end
of Thursday's practice and then have
a special ceremony at the team hotel
Friday night. A couple of seniors will
likely speak about their experiences
at Michigan, a moment Rodriguez
said would be "very, very emotional
for both the coaches and the players."
"The greatest achievement you
can (have) as a college student ath-
lete is to complete your senior year,"
Rodriguez said. "It's not winning
All-American or setting records.
Because if you've done that, gone
through your senior year no matter
what sport, you've made a commit-
ment - a sacrifice - for that team

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez was asked several questions about his job security at his press conference yesterday.

and that university that a lot of peo-
ple haven't.
"If you look at just our seniors now
and the guys that came in with them
that are no longer here didn't make
that same commitment and sacrifice.
These guys have, so they should be
honoredbecause of it."
NOT THINKING ABOUT JOB
SECURITY: A 7-3 record - which
guarantees Michigan's first winning
season with Rodriguez at the helm
- should quiet some of the coaching
hot-seat talk, right?
Well, not in Ann Arbor.
"All we do is come to work every
day and try to build the best program
in America," Rodriguez said. "We've
had obstacles. We've had bumps in
the road. We're pressing forward.
I'm hoping that there's enough posi-
tive momentum and positive talk (so
that) all the negativity that's been
out there kind of gets pushed aside a
little bit. We lose agame, then there's
negative talk that comes out. That's

the nature of the beast."
The Wolverines are the fifth-best
offense in the nation in terms of total
yardage, but questions still arise
about whether or not the spread
offense works in the three-yards-
and-a-cloud-of-dust Big Ten.
"That's for everybody else's opin-
ion," Rodriguez said. "I understand
the talk's out there, and it's been out
there for three years, probably since
the day I took the job and stood right
here for my very first press confer-
ence."
INJURY UPDATE: Michigan beat
Purdue on Saturday without argu-
ably its two most productive defend-
ers, junior nose tackle Mike Martin
and senior linebacker Jonas Mouton.
Rodriguez said it's unclear wheth-
er or not they will be able to play Sat-
urday against Wisconsin.
"We're hopeful they both can
play," Rodriguez said. "They didn't
play at all last week. We'll see what
they can do in practice (Tuesday)

and Wednesday. Hoping to have both
back for Saturday."
Senior Adam Patterson started for
Martin and senior Mark Moundros
started for Mouton against Purdue
last Saturday.
Sophomore running back Mike
Shaw, who left the Purdue game
with concussion-like symptoms, is
awaiting results of tests that will be
conducted the next few days to see if
he can play Saturday.
Last weekend, redshirt junior
Mark Huyge made his third straight
start at right tackle for senior Perry
Dorrestein, who is nursing a knee
sprain. Dorrestein should be back
this week.
Rodriguez said redshirt sopho-
more running back Mike Cox has
been banged up, and that's why he
didn't make the trip to Purdue. Fel-
low running back Fitz Toussaint
returned from a shoulder injury
against Purdue, though he did not
carry the ball.

Blue gets 10th seed, first-round bye

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
For the Daily
The Michigan men's soccer team
and its supporters gathered around
the TVs at Packard Pub on Pack-
ard and State Street in Ann Arbor,
eagerly waiting for the team's name
to pop up as each regional of the
NCAA tournament bracket was
revealed. Everyone knew the Wol-
verines were in the field, it was just
a matter of where. Michigan's Big
Ten conference championship vic-
tory over Penn State just a day ear-
lier gave the team an automatic bid.
With three of the four regionals
already announced, the Wolverines
knew their name would come up
in a matter of seconds. Then, they
saw the last regional flash onto the
screen with Michigan's name on the
right side, signifying a first-round
bye. They were the 10th seed, which
meant a bye and a home game. The
pub erupted in cheers, fist pumps
and chestbumps.
"I thought we could have went
anywhere as high as eight and as
low as twelve. So we're right where
we thought," Michigan coach Steve

Burns said of the team's seed.
South Florida will play at Central
Florida on Thursday for the right to
play Michigan on Sunday afternoon.
If the Wolverines win, they will be
lined up to play seventh-seeded
South Carolina in the round of 16.
Maryland has the top seed in the
region and the second seed overall.
Michigan would likely need to get
through the Diamondbacks to make
it to Santa Barbara for the College
Cup, the Final Four of college soc-
cer.
"The thing I'm most happy about
is that when you look at that draw,
they're (South Florida and Cen-
tral Florida) both warm-weather
teams," Burns said. "So it poses
some challenges for them as they
come into Ann Arbor."
Michigan has played six of the
48 teams in the tournament field
and has a combined record of
5-2-1 against them. The only team
the Wolverines had serious trou-
ble with was Akron, who notched
the third overall seed and beat
Michigan, 7-1, earlier this season.
The Wolverines' last NCAA
Tournament appearance came in

2008 when they had the eleventh
seed and a bye in the first round.
They beat UC-Davis, 2-1, before fall-
ing to Indiana, 3-0, in the regional
semifinals. Their best finish was in
2003 when they made it to the Elite
Eight.
"It's one thing to make it to the
NCAA Tournament," senior mid-
fielder Alex Wood said. "But now it's
about how far we can go. The way
we're playing, I don't see limits. We
want to be playing in Santa Barbara
in the College Cup." .
After starting the season 8-5-3,
the Wolverines caught fire, winning
five straight. The last three came in
the Big Ten Tournament.

Michigan will practice all this
week while Burns makes the trip
to Florida to scout the Wolverines'
next opponent. Burns sid the team
will address any quirks of Central
Florida and South Florida, including
their strategies on corner kicks and
restarts.
The Wolverines beat South Flori-
da 2-0 in the schools' only matchup
in 2003. They have never played
Central Florida.
"Upsets are very common in
tournaments like these and we can't
afford to have that happen to us,"
Wood said. "We've got to take every
game individually and keep moving
forward."

Blue comeback attempt falls short
in tight matchup with No. 5 Xavier

Hicks scores 22
points, 15 in first
half, in losing effort
at Crisler Arena
By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
Xavier's 6-foot-5 senior Amber
Harris got the ball on a fast break,

between MICHIGAN 76
her and
the basket. She took a gigantic
step forward and lept. Harris
cocked the ball back and tried to
slam it home, but was stopped by
the front rim.
Instantly, she got the rebound
and went back up with it, draw-
ing the foul.
She made both her free throws.
She missed the dunk, but she was
able to get points from her effort
regardless.
Last night was that kind of
night for the Michigan women's
basketball team.
The Wolverines (1-1) played

valiantly, sticking with the fifth-
ranked Musketeers for most of
the game, but eventually fizzled
out, losing 85-76 at Crisler Arena.
They led for most of the first
half, staying neck and neck with
a much taller and experienced
Xavier team behind the incred-
ible shooting from senior Veron-
ica Hicks and junior Carmen
Reynolds.
According to sophomore Jenny
Ryan, Xavier has, "the best four
and five combo in the nation,"
with Harris and senior TaShia
Phillips anchoring the post.
Michigan avoided going down
low in the first half, shooting
mid-range jumpers and making
six 3-pointers.
The Wolverines neutralized
the two-headed beast in the
post for the most part and made
Xavier play the fast-paced type of
game they wanted to play.
But the second half was a dif-
ferent story.
Xavier (2-0) couldn't miss a
shot, and Michigan went on a
cold stretch it couldn't afford. its
defense was solid, but not good
enough for the potent Musketeer
offense.

"We did a great job of putting
hands on the shot, but they did a
great job of making them," Mich-
igan coach Kevin Borseth said
after the game.
"Credit to them to be able to
shoot that way."
Michigan looked like it was
in serious trouble with about 12
minutes left in the game, down
by 14 and struggling to do any-
thing offensively.
Instead of losing their compo-
sure though, the young Wolver-
ines showed a great deal of poise
by going on a 15-3 run to get the
lead down to just two with seven
minutes to play.
"We could have easily started
hanging our heads and gave up
and gotten blown out by 20 or 30,
but we decided, 'no,'" Hicks said.
"Before you know it, we're on a
run and we're back to doing what
we know how to do and the lead
is down to two. So I think for our
team, that was a big step."
Things were looking posi-
tive for the Wolverines down
the stretch, but the height of the
Musketeers roster was too much
to handle.
Xavier seemed to grab every

missed shot, and the Wolver-
ine offense became "stagnant,"
according to Borseth.
Phillips and Harris combined
to score 34 points, and even
when they weren't scoring they.
were able to get the ball out to
sharpshooter Katie Rutan. With
the Michigan defense having to
collapse on the post, Rutan used
the extra space to score 22 points
on 7-of-12 shooting from 3-point
range. Incredibly enough, she
didn't attempt a shot inside the
arc.
Even though they didn't come
away with the win, the Wol-
verines may build on this game.
They played extremely well
against one of the best teams in
the country, and the experience
gained from playing a team so
talented cannot be discounted.
Hicks scored 22 points to lead the
team, but the play of Reynolds
and Ryan was most encouraging
for the rest of the season, espe-
cially with the brutal Big-Ten
schedule upcoming.
"I think for our team, that was
a big step," Hicks said.
"We just have to keep putting
those pieces together."

ATTITUDE
From Page1lB
words to some, considering the
Wolverines' roster boasts 13 NHL
draftees - scouts have deemed
nearly half of Michigan's players
worthy of possibly playing at the
next level.
Despite Berenson's comments,
the long-tenured coach has a
realistic outlook for his team, and
the different mindset may be just
what tvfichigan (5-2-1-0 CCHA,
6-3-3 overall) needs to reverse its
weekend dilemma.
"We've got to be a blue-col-
lar, lunch-bucket hockey team,"
Berenson said. "We've got to kick
'em in, deflect 'em in, bounce 'em
in."9
LINE CHANGE: Berenson was
looking for some "life" and he
was rewarded in the Wolverines'
weekend series.
Through the Wolverines' first
six conference games, Berenson
said he wasn't too pleased with
his team's offensive production,
with there being "limited scor-
ing balance" across the four sets
of lines.

But after switching Rust to a
line with forwards Carl Hagelin
and Kevin Lynch for Saturday's
contest against the Fightin
Irish (S-2-1-1, 7-3-1), the trio
produced, netting four points
collectively in the series' second
game.
Hagelin tallied a goal and an
assist, while Rust netted his third
goal of the season - his first since
Oct. 8.
The pair grabbed first-star and
third-star honors, respectively,
for their very impressive perfor-
mances on Saturday.
Rust said that he'd been "fight-
ing" pretty much his whole game
the last few weeks, and with a
relieved look on his face follow-
ing his equalizer, one could cer-
tainly say he was long overdue for
a lamplighter.
"I've been playing pretty gar-
bage this season," Rust said on
Saturday. "Hopefully, I can carry
this confidence into practice next
week and keep producing."
NOTES: Senior goaltender
Bryan Hogan secured his 50th
career win as a Wolverine on Sat-
urday night.... He had 34 saves to
boost his record to 5-1-0 on the
year.

The Boss looks back

How Deathly Hallows'
k illed the franchisefor me

Bruce Springsteen
opens up a time
capsule of rock
By ELLIOT ALPERN
For the Daily
Bruce Springsteen's The Prom-
ise begins with an evocative piano
that's immedi-
ately familiar and
yet surprisingly
fresh, accurately Bruce
foreshadowing
the ensuing 20 $pinfgSteen
songs. A har- The Promise
monica, bitter Columbia
but triumphant,
comes in over
the melancholic piano, and the
introductory track turns out to be
a more recent version of "Racing
in the Street" off the Born to Run
follow-up Darkness on the Edge of
Town. It is haunting, audacious
and ultimately grand, and it kicks
off an elaborate exploration of the
deeper side of The Boss.
Springsteen, after the creation
of his breakthrough album Born
to Run, was forcibly put on hiatus
due to legal issues and contractual
disagreements. Three years later,
Springsteen and his E Street Band
went back to the studio for record-
ing sessions that would eventu-
ally result in Darkness on the Edge
of Town, a largely conceptual
album. These sessions produced a
wealth of material, to the extent
that many songs were left either
unfinished or not included on the
final album. The Promise is a com-
pilation of many of these forgotten
tracks, some with new additions or
even entire re-recordings.
The Promise captures the
Springsteen who has been immor-
talized for his pure, unadulterated
American rock. The songs cover
the emotional gamut; some ("One
Way Street," "City of Night") are
close to heart-wrenching, while
others ("Ain't Good Enough For
You," "Talk To Me") are upbeat
and even uplifting. These are the
types of songs that would typi-
cally be playing in a hole-in-the-
wall bar late one night - no one's
likely to be dancing, but nobody's

he day after I returned
home from my trip to
Israel, the book "Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hal-
lows" was
released. In
my extremely
weak state (I
caught some
kind of flu on
my last day
in Jerusalem,
and yes, flying LEAH
the 11 hours BURGIN
back to the
U.S. - puking
my guts out - was wonderful),
I still pulled myself out of bed
and made it to my local Barnes &
Noble for the midnight release.
I had waited 10 years for this
moment, and nothing was going
to hold me back. I was elated, I
was pumped, I was shaking with
anticipation. Like millions of
other diehard fans, I was finally
going to figure out how this
beloved epic would to end.
Seven hundred and fifty-
nine pages later, I was furious.
I remember sitting on my bed,
screaming at the text "NO! Do
not end this way! Stop being
lame!" as my parents rushed into
my room, worried that I was suf-
fering from flu-related hysteria.
I wouldn't listen to my parents'
soothing words that it "was just a
book" and that everything would
be OK. They didn't understand,
and not in the typical 16-year-old
"my parents don't understand
me" way. That book had broken
my heart: I had hated it.
That's right, I said it. I hated
the seventh and final book of the
Harry Potter series. It was long,
drawn-out and boring. I hated
the camping trip. I hated that
Hedwig died. I hated that Harry
lived. I hated, hated the epilogue.
I hated the book so much that I
wrote a scathing review and sent
it to The Cincinnati Enquirer
(I'm still waiting for that to be
published). For weeks, I was as
angsty and pissy as Harry wasin a
the fifth book. It was a dark time.

rushing to turn them off either.
The tracks are comforting in their
natural simplicity, just like the
songwriter himself.
The highlights of The Prom-
ise are somewhat few and far
between, but ultimately beneficial
to the album as a whole. The songs
each seem to be a part of each
other, to the extent that impercipi-
ent listeners may not catch when
one ends and another begins. This
makes the exceptions all the more
noticeable. "Because The Night"
was originally written by Spring-
steen and then discarded to be
picked up and recorded by Patti
Smith (to notable success). The
wonderfully dark versionincluded
in The Promise and allows guitarist
Steven Van Zandt the opportunity
to showcase his craft. "Ain't Good
Enough For You," early in the sec-I
ond disc, is swinging and fun in

its casual self-deprecation, and its
chorus ("Oh, I quit little darling /
Yeah, no matter what I do / Girl,
you know it's true / Ain't good
enough for you") is infectious.
A few of the tracks may have
best been abandoned altogether.
"Fire," for instance, was original-
ly written and intended for Elvis
Presley. Though interesting, the
song comes off as an Elvis imper-
sonation and feels out of place in
the middle of a Bruce Springsteen
album.
The two discs of forgotten and
lost songs are a welcome addition
to the already illustrious Springs-
teen discography. By mostly using
material recorded from the post-
Born To Run era, the album pro-
vides new music from Springsteen
when he was still at the height of
'his career. As a whole, The Promise
is a worthy venture.

McAdams gives the entire film a

played by Diane Keaton ("Some-

Ford ("Indiana Jones") is a bit too
gruff and tough around the edges.
True, no human being could realis-

with such expediency. No matter -
down it swirls through the formula
machine, unscathed.
"Morning Glory" is a tiny wisp
of a movie - just a puff of air, and
it'll dematerialize into the ether
of inconsequentiality. But like the
after-dinner mint that you pop

sion of a date, that's what it's there
for - easily dissolvable, endlessly
refreshing.

"Wayne's World." And don't forget

re) to school. However, the televised time-
warp is definitely not your par-
ents' show. Despite an onslaught
n good fun, of course. Once of feathered hair and acid-wash
trudged your way through denim, "Daze" manages to relate
able college scenarios, feel to the modern generation. It covers

es and slow-motion soror- high school relationship drama and

ing "Daze" in the '80s isn't the stereotypes and issues still seen
excuse to feature rad music on college campuses. It transforms
sves to be a great opportuni- an Asian fraternity, seemingly
live the movie moments that strict and studious, into an under-
t college students weren't ground rave, causing the students
y alive to see. As if the late to squeal "Isn't being Asian great?!"

"Daze" even digs at affirmative
action: Posh fraternity brothers
speak proudly of their acceptance
of the "first African" member -
only to reveal a white student who
just happens tobe from Africa.
Yet the real charm isn't in the
fraternity houses, it's in the char-
acters. Schwartz exceeds words as
an adorably desperate, eager fresh-
man, lost in his own world of Chris-
topher Reeve-looking idols and
the painful art of butt-branding.
Seeley's Wilson transforms from
uptight jock to sympathetically
real after a night with the "beast,"
an eight-tentacle beer bong that
causes his blood alcohol level, and
his likability, to skyrocket.
1986 may not be the freshest year
- and by no means does the show
give you free reign to break out the
fluorescent spandex - but "Glory
Daze" serves just the right amount
of beloved pop culture favorites
without getting stuck in the past
(or whatever that is stained onto
the fraternity sofa). A combina-
tion of only the best components of
'80s flicks and college fads, "Glory
Daze" is earning its way to the top
of the class.
