Law School alum
brought Pledge of

the Supreme Court
ByVERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
"Why do we have the Fifth
Amendment right to protect peo-

ple from testifying against their
own interests? Shouldn't the law
be able to compel us to tell the
truth?"
Michelle Oberman, a friend
and former Law School classmate
of University Law School alum
Michael Newdow, recalled New-
dow asking these questions in
class one day during a lesson on
the Bill of Rights.
"He was known for asking ques-
tions that tended to derail class,

although that was not his inten-
tion," Oberman said.
This habit of questioning the
status quo of existing governmen-
tal procedures and documents has
earned Newdow a reputation as
one of the leading activists in the
country workingto have the words
"Under God" expunged from fed-
eral documents and declarations
like the United States Constitution
and the Pledge of Allegiance.
Newdow, who graduated from

AFTER THE QUAKE
Now back from Haiti,'U'relief
workers spread cause's message

DOG DAYS ON THE DIAG

Students, UHS
personnel tell stories
of time spent aiding
relief efforts
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
When Haiti reached out to the
world for aid in January, many
members of the University and Ann
Arbor communities heeded the
call. In the months since then, Uni-
versity Health Service workers and
students have continued to help the
 relief effort.
Now - thousands of miles from
the houses laying in rubble and the

disastervictims theyrushed to help
- those who have returned are dis-
cussing their experiences in the
country, in an effort to advocate for
the cause and encourage students
and community members not to
forget the extent of the disaster.
Tim Hausler, an LSA freshman
who accompanied his father to
Haiti to be a part of the relief effort,
said nothing prepared him for
driving through a city where nine
out of every ten homes had been
destroyed.
"Even after seeing all the news-
reels and disaster coverage, it
doesn't really click how bad it
is," he said. "But then when you
get there and you make the drive
from the capital to the epicenter of
the earthquake, you see so much

destruction."
Hausler said he feels nervous
that now, as disaster has begun to
strike other areas and the media
has been focusing less on Haiti,
students will think the problem has
been resolved.
"We cannot forget about what is
going on," he said. "They need us
now just as much as before."
The disaster is especially star-
tling because among the intense
damages are some houses that
have withstood the quake, accord-
ing to Hari Conjeevaram, associate
professor of internal medicine. He
added that even those who haven't
lost their homes are residing close
to the destruction.
"There is so much displacement

Yon said, adding that he believes
Tomukun will be unique to Ann
Arbor.
"We want to create a nice dining
atmosphere with great food at an
affordable price," Yon explained.
Yon said he wants to try to cre-

seven to 12 dollars.
Yon said he co-owns the restau-

One Rackham rep.
elected with only
votes from himself
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Student Assembly
elections held last month yielded
the highest student voter turnout in
years with 5,488 ballots cast. But in

those elections, in which student 14
percent of students voted, Rackham
Rep. HamdanYousuf was the fourth
most successful candidate among
graduate students with 28 weighted
votes - all of them his own.
Yousuf, who has been an MSA
representative since 2008, is one of
four graduate students that serve
on the assembly. He said he believes
that MSA has not performed its
duty of representing graduate stu-
dents, who make up about 40 per-

cent of the University's student
population.
"It's been an ongoing struggle
for us," said Yousuf. "(We) don't see
how MSA is relevant."
Yousuf said the lack of graduate
student involvement in MSA is due
to the misconception that MSA is
the "undergraduate playground,"
adding that graduate student elec-
tions are "much less competitive"
than the undergraduate ones.

Reg istering transplant donors

Created in the fall uf last
year, Michigan Marruw
fur Minorities is a student
grnup luoking to increase
bunt marruw registratiun
amung minurity groups un
campus.
LSA junior Mahjabeen
Siddiqui, a cure leader of
MMM, said the group's gual
is to raise awareness about
the bunt marruw registry
foundation, Be The Match-
an urganizatiun created by
the Natiunal Macmow Donor
Prugram that already has
nmure than 8 nmilliun poten-
tial dunurs registered.
Anyonec between the ages
of 18 and 60 years, who meet
establishcd health guide-
lines can register In he a
naurrow donur, accurding
tu Be The Match. The reg-
istratiun process invulves

completing a health histury
form and taking a cheek
swab fur DNA analysis.
There are inure than
10,000 medical patients
every year in the United
States in need ofa bune mar-
row transplant, accurdingnuo
a release by Be The Match.
"Finding a match
depends un huw rinse a
patient's genes nmatch with
(the genes of) anuther indi-
vidual," Siddiqui wrute in an
e-mail interview. "The best
chance uf finding a persun
with a rinse gene nmatch is
within your uwn family ur
with peuple who are frum
yuur ethnicity."
MMM will fucus next
year un finding a larger
audience uf hunt marruw
donurs tu help patients with
life-threatening diseases,

Siddiqui said. Because the
group is shifting its fucus
to dunur recruitment, Sid-
diqui added that MMM is
currently in the prucess uf
changing its name.
"I would nut want uur
urganizatiun tu be pur-
trayed as if we are unly louk-
lug fur minurities, because
even Caucasians have a very
difficult time in finding a
match," Siddiqui wrute in
the e-mail.
"We initially started the
urganizatiun, thinking that
msinurities are in inure need
since there are less minuri-
ties registered within the
registry," Siddiqui wrote.
"Huwever, even though
there are fewer minuri-
ties registered, it's nut just
nminurities that need help
when it cumes tu finding a

match."
Siddiqui said MMM
will focus next year un
recruiting a large number
uf students to vulunteer fur
registry drives and to wurk
with uther student gruups
like the lucal chapter uf the
Red Cruss.
The -10 members that
make up MMM have been
invulved in bunt marruw
registry drives at events like
the UM vs. OSU Blood Bat-
tie and an MSA-spunsured
bluod drive, Siddiqui wrute
in the e-mail.
Siddiqui said she hupes
that thruugh the group's
effurts MMM can "give
peuple who nted bunt mar-
row transplants hupe that
they'll find a match on the
registry."

NEWS BRIEFS
SALINE, Mich.
Saline area schools
lay off 63 teachers
The Saline Area Schools has
issued layoff notices to 63 teach-
ers.
Administrators say the pink
slips handed out Tuesday are part
of the Washtenaw County school
district's effort to further pare
down a $3 millionbudget shortfall
for the next school year.
Assistant superintendent Steve
Laatsch says the district expects
to eliminate about 20 full-time
positions. But 63 notices had to be
issued because of contract rules
on seniority and federal require-
ments governing who can teach
what subjects and grades.
Besides budget constrictions,
Laatsch says the district also is
cutting jobs because Houghton
Elementary School is being closed.
Staff members who received
notices are to meet this week to
discuss their options.
Saline is 35 miles southwest of
Detroit.
SAN DIEGO
Marine's Facebook
fuels debate
A Camp Pendleton Marine
has removed his Facebook page
after his comments fueled a free-
speech debate about whether
troops are allowed to criticize
President Barack Obama's policies
while serving in the military.
Sgt. Gary Stein said he was
asked by his superiors to review
the Pentagon's directive on politi-
cal activities after he criticized
Obama's health care reform
efforts and then was asked this
week to talk about his views on the
MSNBC cable TV channel.
Stein said his supervisor told
him of his right to an attorney
about the matter. He said he
decided to close hisFacebook page
and review his military code obli-
gations. He also contacted private
attorneys who told him he had
done nothing wrong.
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
Caribbean bans all
dumping into sea
Countries in the Caribbean
have agreed to bar the dumping
of all garbage at sea, ending rules
that allow the disposal of metal,
glass and other refuse a short dis-
tance from shore and almost any
trash farther out.
The nations adopted the new
requirement under the U.N.'s
International Maritime Organiza-
tion and it will take effect in May
2011, IMO consultant Jeff Ramos
said Wednesday.
The United Nations created
the ban to protect areas that are
vulnerable because of heavy ship
traffic or sensitive ecology. It has
already taken effect in the Antarc-
tic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea,
the Persian Gulf and the Mediter-
"It's a big deal," said Ramos,
a U.S. Coast Guard commander
based on the Dutch island of Cura-
cao near Venezuela. "Especially in
the Caribbean, with all the tank-
ers and the traffic going to the

Panama Canal, it will make a big
impact."
CAIRO, Egypt
Ancient royal
scribe unearthed
The elaborate tomb of an
ancient royal scribe has been
 unearthed in a discovery that will
help illuminate the relationship
between Egypt and its eastern
neighbors, the antiquities chief
said yesterday.
The intricately decorated tomb
belonging to Ken-Amun, who was
in charge of overseeing the royal
records during the 19th Dynasty
(1315-1201 B.C.), was unearthed
in the village of Tell el-Maskhuta,
75 miles (120 kilometers) east of
Cairo, said Zahi Hawass, head of
the Supreme Council of Antiqui-
ties.
Tell el-Maskhuta was a settle-
ment in the Ismailia governorate
containing a garrison that sup-
plied and armed the ancient Egyp-
tian army before the troops went
on military campaigns east of the
O border.
Ken-Amun's tomb is that first
Ramesside tomb to be discovered
in Lower Egypt and is built from
mud brick, consisting of a rectan-
gular room with a stone-domed
ceiling. Hawass said the inscrip-
tions would aid in the understand-
ing of Egypt's relationships with
its neighbors to the east.

Paln puts own

Those in Washington
must work for the
people, Palin says
BOSTON (AP) - Sarah Palin
rallied the conservative tea party
movement near the scene of its his-
torical inspiration yesterday, telling
Washington politicians that gov-
ernment should be working for the
people, not the other way around.
Addressing roughly 5,000
people, the 2008 Republican vice
presidential nominee accused Pres-
ident Barack Obama of overreach-
ing with his $787 billion stimulus
program. She also criticized the
administration's health care, stu-
dent loan and financial regulatory
overhauls.
"Is this what their 'change' is all
about?" Palin asked the crowd on
a sun-splashed Boston Common.
"I want to tell 'em, nah, we'll keep
clinging to our Constitution and
our guns and religion - and you
can keep the change."
Tea partiers planned to meet
for a final rally in Washington on
Thursday, coinciding with the
federal tax-filing deadline. Local
events are also planned in Oklaho-
ma, Ohio and other locations.
Palin put her own spin on Tax
Day, saying, "We need to cut taxes
so that our families can keep more
of what they earn and produce, and
our mom-and-pops, then, our small
businesses, can reinvest according
to our ownpriorities, and hire more
people and let the private sector

grow and thrive and prosper."
She also played to the crowd by
trotting out a trademark line as she
lobbied for more domestic energy
production.
"Yeah, let's drill, baby, drill, not
stall, baby, stall - you betcha,"
Palin said, though Obama recently
proposed to expand drilling off the
Atlantic, and Gulf coasts.
The gathering intended to hark
back to 1773, when American colo-
nists upset about British taxation
without government representa-
tion threw British tea into the har-
bor in protest - just a mile from the
site of yesterday's rally.
Americans are paying lower
taxes this year, but that is not
expected to last. In the next few
years, some increases will come
as part of the national health care
overhaul.
The modern tea party move-
ment claims both Republican and
Democratic members and is punc-
tuated by those who question the
legitimacy of Obama's presidency.
Some doubt he was born in the
United States, as his birth certifi-
cate shows.
Several speakers protested sug-
gestions of racist undertones to the
movement, which sprouted as the
nation elected its first black presi-
dent. Nonetheless, virtually the
entire speaking program and audi-
ence were white.
An exception was the singer of
the Tea Party anthem, Lloyd Mar-
cus, who made a point of describing
himself not as African-American,
but American.

Officials say at least
10,000 injured in
earthquake
XINING, China (AP) - Soldiers
and civilians used shovels and their
bare hands to dig through collapsed
buildings in search of survivors after
strong earthquakes struck a moun-
tainous Tibetan region of China yes-
terday, killing at least 589 people and
injuringumore than 10,000.
The series of quakes flattened
buildings across remote western
Yushu county and sent survivors,
many bleeding from their wounds,
flooding into the streets of Jiegu
township. State television showed

block after devastated block of
toppled mud and wood homes.
Local officials said 85 percent of
the structures had been destroyed.
Residents and troops garrisoned
in the town used shovels and their
hands to pull survivors and bodies
from the rubble much of the day.
Several schools collapsed, with the
state news agency saying at least
56 students died. Worst hit was the
Yushu Vocational School, where
Xinhua cited a local education offi-
cial as saying 22 students died.
Footage on Qinghai Satellite TV
showed bodies wrapped in blan-
kets lying on the ground while
rescuers pulled shards of concrete
from a pancaked school building.
Crews set up emergency genera-

tors to restore operations atYushu's
airport, and by late afternoon the
first of six flights landed carrying
rescue workers and equipment. But
the road to town was blocked by a
landslide, hampering the rescue
as temperatures dropped below
freezing. Tens of thousands of the
town's 70,000 people were without
shelter, state media said.
The airport in Xining, the near-
est big city some 530 miles (860
kilometers) away, was filled in the
predawn hours today with Chinese

An 'F' in budgeting
Legislators shouldn't cut community college funding
N o one should be priced out of higher education. Yet with
a potential tuition increase looming for Michigan's
community colleges, a college degree may become even
harder to attain. A new budget being discussed by the House
Appropriations Committee this week proposes to cut funding for
community colleges by 3 percent. While the gravity of the state's
budget woes is well known, the state's already-decimated higher
education funding cannot afford more cuts - especially to com-
munity colleges, which are a valuable part of the higher educa-
tion system. State legislators should recognize the importance of
community colleges and reject the proposed funding cuts.

The year in review

On Monday, NPR reported that the
Michigan House Appropriations Commit-
tee is currently debating a budget proposal
to cut funding for community colleges by
3 percent. According to Mike Hansen, cur-
rent president of the Michigan Community
College Association, community colleges
may have to raise tuition rates between 5
and 10 percent for the fall semester to meet
demand. This potential tuition hike comes as
Michigan's community colleges are report-
ing enrollment numbers at record highs.
Institutions of higher education - com-
munity, public or private - are critical to
the future of the state. The path to a better
economy lay in the education of the work-
force of tomorrow. State legislators should
realize that with the economy still in crisis,
a raise in community college tuition could
deter low-income students from continu-
ing their education. For many students in
the state, the prohibitive cost of a private
or public four-year university leads them
to choose community colleges to fulfill
preliminary requirements before transfer-
ring to a larger institution. For these stu-
dents, attending a community college must
remain a viable option.
Community colleges play an integral role
in the higher education system. In addi-
tion to providing students with a cheaper
alternative to traditional four-year colleg-

es, many community colleges also serve as
vocational schools. They provide students
with an education tailored to careers that
many four-year institutions don't offer.
Important career fields like mechani-
cal service and law enforcement are often
certified through community colleges.
Increasing the tuition for schools that pro-
vide vocational training would be a disser-
vice to Michigan communities.
These institutions also provide an afford-
able education for adults looking for a fresh
start on their careers. With the auto industry
in peril and one of the largest state unem-
ployment rates in the country, Michigan's
community colleges have the potential to aid
in the diversification of the state economy.
Community colleges should remain a place to
retrain workers who have been laid off for a
new industry in an accessible, affordable way.
But many of these people already struggle
to pay for professional retraining. A further
raise in tuition could hinder the transition to
a more diverse economy for Michigan.
Raising tuition at community colleges
isn't the answer to the state's budget woes.
Education should be a means by which the
state can diversify its economy for more sus-
tainable growth. For many, that education
begins at a community college, and state leg-
islatures shouldn't hamper financial accessi-
bility to these institutions.

t was the best of times, it was
the worst of times, and when the
Tea Partiers come to the Diag
tonight it's going
to be a god-awful
time. But let's start
at the beginning,
backnin September,
when thousands
of students from
millions of coun-
tries with bajil- _
lions of diverse-
experiences came WILL
to the University GRUNDLER
of Michigan, all
united by a single -------
common purpose:
inebriation. But also football. So
when allegations surfaced that Coach
Rodriguez had overworked players to
the point of exhaustion and - in one
extreme incident - forced a player to
stand on one leg, rub his belly AND
pat his head all at the same time for
over an hour, students cried foul. No
one - no one - would taint the ath-
letic program.
But by October, no one was show-
ing up for home games after another
embarrassing season materialized.
In a stunning reversal, most stu-
dents quietly admitted that the foot-
ball team hadn't been overworked
enough, and they finally got around
to doing their schoolwork. Or they
would have got around to doing their
schoolwork if the threat of swine flu
hadn't thrown the entire campus into
a state of red alert and caused North
Campus to be quarantined, blockaded
and ultimately destroyed. No, sorry,
that was what happened in my imagi-
nation. What actually happened was
nothing, but many students took the
opportunity to skip classes by saying
that they were possibly dying.
This was a good idea since many
needed all the energy they could

get for November, which is the only
month hated by absolutely everyone.
It got cold, as usual, and dark and
depressing (as usual), and the foot-
ball team lost to Ohio State (as usual),
and the federal government decided
to tryto reform health care (as usual).
Normally we at the Daily don't like to
discuss off-campus issues, but the
passage of the preliminary health
care bill created quite a stir. All over
campus a majority of students said
something along the lines of, "Hey,
health care's getting there. Cool,"
while a minority of students brain-
stormed furiously for a new Obama
pun. (ObaMao was born.)
And so December entered the record
books, and if any hope was to be seen
on students' faces because of the prom-
ise of universal health care it would
have been a shrouded, misty kind of
hope, obscured by - I'm sorry, I'm
terrible at metaphors. What I mean to
say is that it started snowing and you
couldn'treally see people's faces. Other
than that nothing much happened.
People went on winter break...?
January was much more excit-
ing. It was a new year! Everyone was
excited and happy and hoped the
economy would turn around and they
laughed in that good, wholesome,
dumb American way every time they
wrote "2009" as the year. Countless
students started hitting the gym with
renewed enthusiasm and vigor and
notebooks to record whatever it is you
record in notebooks in gyms without
caring that people thought they were
complete imbeciles. It was a month
of innocence, of youthful gaiety, a
month that couldn't be beaten.
Until February. In February it
was announced that Obama would
be speaking at spring commence-
ment. Classes ceased for a day. The
bell tower rang for hours. Even win-
ter eased its icy spell. Not all stu-

dents were pleased, however. Some
felt cheated. Some felt robbed. Some
decided NOT to attend graduation,
to show the president who's boss.
The president wrote a public state-
ment for the Daily, urging students
to come to graduation, threatening
that if they did nout they would hurt
his feelings. That was a proud day for
the Daily, we must admit, publishing
a sitting president.
This year has been *
exciting. A girl
even talked to me.
But along with good news there is
always bad news. So it came to pass
in March the grievous news of the
Michigan Student Assembly - the
doomed website, the extravagant trips
to Okemos and Las Vegas, the lack of
cookies and punch at meetings, the
really boring meetings, the embarrass-
ingendorsementofTigerWoodsbefore
his affairs came to light. All contrib-
uted to a whopping 14 percent student
involvement in the annual elections -
and a new party in charge. MForward
faces a future full of responsibility.
Now we're here, in April. Another
academic year almost finished. Hard
to believe, right? There are many
things that happened in the past
eight months that a small column
such as this cannot detail thoroughly.
A girl flirted with me at a party once.
I think there's talk of a smoking ban,
too. Regardless, time goes on. Have a
good summer, kids.

Making stress less

a

Each year, students at the University look
forward to spring as a relief from the bitter
Michigan winter. But as sunny days become
more common, spring harshly welcomes us
with research papers, exams, projects and
presentations. Excitement for spring is often
short-lived as April also marks the madness
known as finals season. Although stress is an
inescapable part of the college experience, the
culmination of a semester is no excuse for stu-
dents to engage in unhealthy habits.
Overwhelmed students often resort to poor
choices like caffeine addiction, sleepless nights
and other tactics when dealing with stress rather
than seeking healthy ways to relieve the tension
of finals. Though it holds true that every college
student has their own way to deal with the pres-
sure, stress becomes a problem when it prevents
them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
In addition to maintaining a perfect GPA,
many of us are balancing jobs or leadership posi-
tions in student organizations, applying for sum-
mer internships and tryingto preserve our social
lives. These commitments cause many of us to be
constantly stressed throughout the school year.
And as finals season rears its ugly head, student
stress reaches dangerous levels. According to a
Counseling and Psychological Services (more
commonly referred to as CAPS) College Student
Mental Health Survey conducted in 2006,30 per-
cent of a sample of 2,358 students sought coun-
seling services. This survey gives insight into the
current campus attitudes toward stress and the
lack of resources available to us. So then the ques-
tion becomes, how much higher would this per-
centage be if support and counseling were better
advertised? Universities need to promote more
outlets where students can express themselves
without the heavy hand of stress hindering their
thought processes.
Severe stress is an unspoken issue at the
University. While the University ensures the
physical safety of its students via Department
of Public Safety e-mails and texts, an office like
CAPS is a severely under-utilized resource,
indicating that most students either choose to
deal with stress on their own or are unaware
of this support. For incoming freshmen, the
importance of DPS and University Health Ser-
vice is emphasized. For example, posted safety
alerts and health fact sheets are in every resi-
dence hall. DPS e-mails are made available to
every University-affiliated person. While a few

resident advisors may post information about
CAPS and other support, stress relief often
becomes the responsibility of the student.
During Festifall, we all get student hand-
books that no one really reads, which is
another demonstration of CAPS's invisibility.
Somewhere in there, CAPS is probably listed,
but no one looks for this resource. Again, the
University - and perhaps CAPS itself - should
make CAPS and it programs more visible. The
University needs to educate its students about
stress and de-stigmatize psychological coun-
seling. Instead of viewing counseling as some
type of beneficial aid, as it should be, most stu-
dents see it as a crutch that holds them back
emotionally and socially. Oftentimes, talk-
ing with our peers about counseling can be
received with apathy, surprise and discomfort.
We need to abandon these attitudes; chronic
stress needs to be more aggressively and com-
passionately addressed by the administration,
faculty, peers and ourselves.
While CAPS is certainly a great campus
resource, most of us also overlook the power that
certain student-organized events can have on
our well-being. Like that arts and crafts event in
the Union. Or that film screening in Angell Hall.
Unfortunately, the arts are often overlooked as
stress relievers. Yet, art takes on many differ-
ent forms, and because of this, can appeal to all
of us. Since most student events revolve around
dialogue, film screenings and cultural shows,
there are an array of free, unconventional and
fun activities that can help us relax.
One event designed to relieve stress is a
Fighting Obstacles Knowing Ultimate Success
(F.O.K.U.S.), presentation of {Vanguards} - a
community-wide block party and music festival
celebrating the end of another hectic school year
and the glorious arrival of summer. Scheduled
from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, Apr. 170nthe
Diag, {Vanguards} will combine live musical per-
formances from nationally recognized artists as
well as student and local performers. Addition-
ally, schoolyard games of years past like double
dutch, hula hoop and hackeysack will take place,
as well as the creation of a community mural to
give students a safe, fun and unique way to take a
study break from finals.
Bryan Davila is the vice president of
F.O.K.U.S. and Felix Lopez and Nina Nwachukwu
are CORE members of F.O.K.U.S.

The real Tea Party platform

With all the talk these days about the Tea Party, and all
the misinformation and innuendo propagated by the Left
toward a genuinely organic movement, one must search
long and hard to find the true identity of the people who
consider themselves a part of this spontaneous and loose-
ly-affiliated movement. The Tea Party is not made up of
Sarah Palin types, as MSNBC would have you believe.
Nor is it made up of racists or homophobes frothing at the
mouth. Many Tea Party members will even tell you that
they loathe any sort of affiliation with the Republican
Party. So who exactly are the people who have planned a
rally on the Diag for 7 p.m. this evening?
The Tea Party, of which I am a participant, observer
and organizer, began early last year not as a response to
Rick Santelli's angry outburst on the floor of the Chicago
Board of Trade and not in response to the calls of conser-
vative politicians or radio talk-show hosts. It is instead
a release of pent-up anger over the size and scope of the
federal government. Many "Tea Partiers" were genuinely
concerned and upset about the deficit spending in Presi-
dent George W. Bush's later years, and this concern con-
tinued on into the current administration.
The defeat of President Barack Obama's radical agenda
is one of the main focuses of this movement, which seeks
to restore limited-government Constitutionalism to its
proper place in our society. Tea Party members view the
massive deficit spending and growing size of the federal
government (with all of its new regulations that are sup-
posed to protect people from themselves) as directly in
conflict with the principles espoused by our Founding
Fathers in our founding documents.
We view higher taxation as an imposition upon eco-
nomic prosperity. A man's right to earn, create and own
property is the essential building block of a free market
society. We view governmental mandates to buy health-
care as an imposition upon personal freedom and choice.
We view cradle-to-grave entitlement programs as irre-
sponsible and as "generational theft," a term invented by
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz).
The Tea Party movement is all about personal responsi-
bility, hard work, and the ability ofthe individual to improve
his or her own condition through their efforts. We see bank-
rupt entities like Social Security and Medicare, and then
listen to D.C. politicians promising newer, bigger programs
that will "work". And we don't buy it. At least someone

hasn't fallen for the sugar-sweet but nevertheless insub-
stantial and poisonous rhetoric of "hope and change."
So what does the Democratic party and the drive-by
media do in response? Pick out a few protestors who dare
compare Obama to Hitler. Make up stories about "homo-
phobic slurs" or "racial epithets" barely based in real-
ity and make these rare occurrences into the face of the
movement that has given millions of Americans a voice
for the first time in their political lives. And most notably, 4
the opponents of the Tea Party launch cowardly ad homi-
nem attacks on its members - everyday Americans who
are simply fed up.
How is it that during the Bush years, the Left in dis-
sent was "the highest form of patriotism," yet when the
Tea Party raises its head today, they are labeled as some-
how "un-American" and must be crushed? And why is
the Left, the supposed bastion of tolerance, so intolerant
of Tea Partiers speaking their minds? It is clear where
the double standard lies. And it is interesting to see the
leader of the College Democrats on campus speak about
the movement as being justifiable and a perfectly decent
method ofexpressingopinions one month and thencreate
a Facebook event to bash it the next. Apparently the Left
would rather rail against, belittle and carry out character
assassinations against members of the Tea Party instead
of addressing their real concerns.
The Tea Party represents Middle America. It is not
a conservative movement. It is not a libertarian move-
ment. It is not a Sarah Palin movement. It is not a Nazi,
bigoted, fringe or racist movement. And it is certainly not
a Republican movement. It is instead an American move-
ment, quintessentially seeking to return to our founding I
principles of limited government at their very core.
The Tea Party views the current agenda and big-
government policies as a trade-in of liberty for security
promised by a federal government that doesn't have that
great of a record of keeping its past promises. They see
it as fundamentally un-American. That's why Tea Party
members are exercising our First Amendment rights of
assembly, free speech and petition. The Tea Party sees .
a need for a fundamental shift in the direction of this
country and the role of the government in our lives. And
it is right.

NEWDOW
From Page 1A
Newdow was eventually defeated.
In addition, Newdow is also
trying to get the words "In God
We Trust" removed from U.S.
currency and is working to elimi-
nate the presidential inaugural
prayer.
Mike's mother Roz Newdow
said she and her husband didn't
try to persuade their children
to take up any specific beliefs.
Instead all the members of the
family, which she described as
Jewish but secular, independently
became atheists.
"We're all atheists," Roz said.
"But it was all their decision."
But Newdow, who was born in
1953 in New York, claims he was
an atheist since he was in the
womb.
"I was born an atheist, as we
all were," he said in an interview
over the summer. "And I never
changed."
Julie Newdow, Newdow's
younger sister, said the family
never overtly discussed their reli-
gious beliefs among one another
until her brother's court cases
started.
But Newdow's work to reform
governmental language as it per-
tains to religion doesn't stem so
much from his religious convic-
tions as it does from his passion
for law, said Oberman, now a pro-
fessor at the Santa Clara Univer-
sity School of Law.
Newdow's fervor to preserve
the foundations of the Bill of
Rights has influenced his endeav-
or to reverse Americans' standard
to "profess and even embrace a
God-centered rhetoric in the pub-
lic sphere," Oberman said.
"His research shows unequivo-
cal proof of the founders' inten-
tion to make this country free
from persecution on account of
one's personal religious beliefs,"
Oberman said.
Newdow developed his pas-
sion for the constitution during
his time at the University's Law
School. After earning his bach-
elor's degree in biology from
Brown University in 1974 and his
medical degree from the Univer-
sity of California at Los Angeles
Medical School in 1978, he decid-
ed several years later to pursue
his law degree at Michigan.
In his early thirties when he
started law school, Newdow was
older than most students at the

University. Employing his medi-
cal background, he worked as a
locum tenens ER physician - a
physician who substitutes for
other physicians - at various hos-
pitals in Michigan during his time
as a law student.
While in Ann Arbor, Newdow
also grew to have a close friend-
ship with his professor, Peter
Westen.
The two - who still keep in
touch today - would meet dur-
ing office hours to talk about class
material, though their discus-
sions often meandered beyond the
course subject matter.
"He has maybe the most eager-
to-learn mind than anyone I
know, and it's certainly one of his
best qualities," Weston said. "He
always wants to learn."
Julie said that, as a kid, New-
dow would study the dictionary;
simply open the heavy book and
learn words he didn't know. She
said he'd also write songs about
some of the words, choosing the
most obscure vocabulary to fold
into the next verse.
"He was always just in anoth-
er stratosphere, another world,"
Julie said. "Not only because he's
so brilliant, but he has this work
ethic and at the same time is
extremely humble."
Julie said Newdow's pension
for making changes to the sys-
tem could be seen during his time
working in hospitals while he
was in law school. She said that
from her understanding, he told
many patients that the tests doc-
tors prescribed for them weren't
necessary, but instead were very
costly.
"He would try to change the
system that probably should
be changed," she said "He'd go
against bureaucracy. He can't
keep his mouth quiet if he believes
in something."
Though Newdow planned to
combine his expertise in both law
and health after law school, by
going into health law, he ended up
taking a different path.
Oberman said Newdow's deci-
sion to carry out his convictions
regarding religion in government
began when he was teaching his
daughter math at a store one day
a few years ago.
"While standing in line teach-
ing (his daughter) math sums...he
happened to notice the words, 'In
God We Trust' on the coin," Ober-
man said. "Soit began."
When he saw this phrase on the
coin, Newdow said he thought,

"This can't be right. I'm getting
this off."
Lawrence Marshall, Oberman's
husband and director of the Mills
Legal Clinic in Stanford Law
School, said Newdow's work on
the Pledge of Allegiance case that
went to the Supreme Court was
widely respected in the law com-
munity.
"It was just a tour de force,"
Marshall said. "Several very
prominent legislators came up to
me afterward with their jaws on
the floor. They were just so awed
by how marvelous a job (Newdow)
did at the relevant issue and most
importantly maintaining a cer-
tain tone and decorum."
Marshall added that Newdow's
work in the courtroom wasn't
surprising given his personality.
"He's among the most passion-
ate I know," Marshall said. "He
sees the world as it oughteto be and
refuses to accept it to be anything
else. He's incapable of accepting
the idea of institutions or people
to be less than the ideals that they
promote and claim to be."
Marshall said even though
Newdow ultimately didn't win the
case, it wasn't because his logic
was flawed, but rather because it
explicitly challenged the tradi-
tional foundations of the federal
government.
"It's very difficult for a court to
look at the law at this field and say,
'Yes it's fine to tell our school chil-
dren that our nation is under God
and that the children who don't
believe in God are inferior,"' Mar-
shall said. "It seems to me that
this is the implicit message kids
are being given every morning."
Marshall continued, "It's real
clear. But based on the law and
the principles of the first amend-
ment, the problems are at the level
of political realities that courts
have to deal with. This is what
caused the struggle."
Oberman said she thinks the
reason there is so much contro-
versy surrounding Newdow's
efforts is because of a biased opin-
ion against atheists' beliefs in the
United States.
"He is seen as being hostile to
God and to those who believe in a
deity," she said. "On the contrary,
his position is simply that God-
talk doesn't belong in the public
sphere."
One of the presiding judges on
the case at the U.S. 9th Circuit
of Appeals, Carlos Bea disagreed
with Newdow, saying that gov-
ernmental references to God

have, in the past, been accepted in
certain situations.
"Not every mention of God or
religion by our government or at
the government's direction is a
violation of the Establishment
Clause," wrote Bea.
Newdow said he believes those
who disagree with him don't have
a complete understanding of the
issue. He said he has asked people
if they agree that the government
should show equal respect to
everyone regardless of their dif-
ferent backgrounds, particularly
race. After they all answered "of
course," Newdow continued to
explain that this principle should
extend to religion, and that the
government shouldn't impose
one belief system over another
through oaths that children in
public schools have to recite each
morning.
Marshall said Newdow's
work toward this reformation is
"emblematic of Newdow's passion
and principle."
"As he repeatedly said, the idea
that you would have the nation
being necessarily theistic is very
problematic," Marshall said. "On
the other hand, there is also an
understanding that there are lim-
its on how far the courts are likely
to go even if a matter of logic and
principles (is) correct."
Now residing in California,
Newdow still does locum ER
work, and during his free time, he
said he enjoys playing the guitar
and songwriting.
Newdow said he's already
released three CDs featuring lyr-
ics representing his beliefs that
religion shouldn't be involved in
the government.
One song called "Be Fair," from
his WASP Side Story album dem-
onstrates his opinion regarding
the phrase "In God we trust."
"In God some don't trust," the
song states. "No, in God some
don't trust/ If you see Him, then
good for you/ But for others, He's
just not true/ show care, let's
share. Be fair."
Both Newdow's sister and
mother said they have been unbe-
lievably proud of Newdow in his
endeavors. Julie said she went to
the Supreme Court to watch him
argue his case and said he was
incredible.
"He (is) always challenging the
universe, seeing how well he can
do something on his own," Julie
said. "He thinks on his own, and
accomplishes a lot, not necessar-
ily following all the rules."

TOMUKUN
From Page 1A
into effect over the summer, Yon
said. Once it receives the license,
Tomukun plans to serve Korean,
Japanese, and Chinese beers, as well
as Soju-Korean rice wine and Saki.
"We will shut down the dinner
menu at 10 and then offer an appetiz-
er menu so bar goers can have appe-
tizers with their drinks,"Yon said.
Located on East Liberty Street
near State Street, Yon said he thinks
his restaurant will be part of a revi-
talization of the area.
"We love the location," Yon said.
"It seems like Ann Arbor is tryingto
revive (East) Liberty (Street)."
Additionally, the owners said they
believe Ann Arbor is a great place for
a noodle bar, a concept which they
said is popular acrossthe country.
"We modeled Tomukun off of the
popular noodle bars in larger cities
aroundthe country,"Yon said.
Yon,HangandKimsaidtheyhope
for a clientele of students, locals and
visitors alike, having already hired a
staff of students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents.

Thursday, April 15, 2010 - 5A
All three owners have experience
in the restaurant industry. Yon man-
aged Asian restaurant Yotsuba on
Washtenaw Avenue for three years.
Hang's family owns several Pan-
Asian restaurants throughout south-
east Michigan and has worked with
Kim in other restaurants around the
area.
When Tomukun opens, it will
serve food from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on
weekdays, and 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. on
weekends. It will initially be closed
on Mondays, but Yon says this is only
temporary.
LSA sophomore Devyani Upadhy-
aya said she wasn't sure if she would
go to the restaurant.
"It sounds too similar to the other
restaurants on campus, like Noodles
and Company or Sadako," she said.
"I might try the bar when I turn 21
though."
But LSA junior Spencer Smith said
he will definitely try the food when
Tomukun opens.
"It sounds like something that
I'd be interested in," Smith said.
"It will be nice to have a restaurant
with Asian cuisine righthere intown
where I can sit down and have a nice
meal without eating a lot."


MSA
From Page 1A
Michael Benson, an MSA repre-
sentative since 2007 and recently
elected president of Rackhamgradu-
ate school, said graduate students
usually garner about 500 votes as a
collective group. He added that indi-
vidual graduate student candidates
often only need a handful of votes to
win while undergraduates running
in contested elections usually get
hundreds of votes in order to become
MSA representatives.
Yousuf, who technically needed
just one vote to win his uncontested
election, said he wrote in his name
on several online ballots, changing
punctuation with each entry to gen-
erate additional votes through the
faulty votingosystem.
The outgoing chair of MSA's Rules
and Elections Committee, Benson
said the voting website's flaw makes
the assembly "undemocratic." He
added that issues with the system, if
made public to voters, could be prob-
lematitfor the assembly.
"If other people knew about that
it could dilute the system," Ben-
son said. "This is an idiosyncrasy
between the voting system and the
MSA rules."
Yousuf said graduate student

underrepresentation has been- an
ongoing issue but was truly brought
to his attention during the MSA elec-
tions.
Graduate students who currently
serve on the assembly, Yousuf added,
are looking to increase the visibility
of graduate studentissuesoncampus
and the significance of the group as
a part of the University community.
MSA President Chris Armstrong,
who was elected in last month's
elections with a margin of more
than 1,000 votes, wrote in ane-mail
interview that he wants to make an
effort to engage graduate students
and make sure they are represefted
on the assembly because they are "a
crucialpartofthe UMcommunity."
"The first step is to fill each of
MSA's Rackham representative
seats," he wrote. "As has bee} the
case in the past, there are currently
several vacancies, which any Rack-
hamstudentcan occupy."
He added that he hopes that by
pushing more Rackham students to
run for positions in MSA, the assym-
bly will be able to better address the
needs of graduate students.
"What we hope to do come fall,
is encourage more of the graduate
studentbodyto represent their peers
who can then help MSA to engage
Michigan's graduate students," he
wrote.

their culture," he said. "People real-
ly smile, go to church every Sunday
and sing songs in the middle of the
night."
Sacha Montas a University
emergency medicine resident,
said though the Haitian people he
encountered were exhausted by
all of the loss they had endured, he
sensed a strong appreciation for his
services.
"People were tremendously
grateful about our presence, which
was extremely rewarding," he said.
For the University members
and other relief workers, making
the trip to Haiti was only half the
battle. Once situated amidst the
rubble, they still needed to figure
out how to make sure those who
* needed aid were able to get it.

was given 30-minutes to present
their argument in front of three
judges yesterday. The judges will
decide in the coming months wheth-
er to uphold the ruling or reinstate
the conviction. No matter that rul-
ing, the case is likely to be appealed
to the Michigan Supreme Court.
Because Swain's original attor-
ney was ruled to be "constitutionally
ineffective," her attorneys from the
Innocence Clinic were able to pro-
vide new evidence to judges to have
her case overturned, Plummer said.
"One of the biggest challenges
initially was figuring out where to
even go or how to help," Montas
said.
However,accordingto many who
visited, infrastructure is improving
as private clinics open their doors
to help the needy and relief teams
from different countries are work-
ing closely together.
Marie Lozon, division director
of pediatric emergency medicine
at the University, recently returned
from a relief trip deployed by the
University aboard the United States
Navy ship "The Comfort."
Lozon said she was lucky to be
part of a crew that was very effi-
cient.
"We were so well prepared by
the University Health Services,"
she said. "We had the right shots,
the right medication, the right
paperwork, the right preparation."
Patients were brought aboard
the ship - which housed the only
working CT scanner in Haiti and a
number of intensive care units and
operating rooms - byeither boat or
helicopter, Lozon said.
Lozon stressed that working so
closely with the Navy gave her a
newfound appreciation for itswork.
"I'm not that familiar with the
military; I'm a U of M Ann Arbor

However, Syed said the defini-
tion of new evidence has not been
agreed upon.
"Exactly what new evidence
means was a big question for the
court today," Syed said. "Judges
aren't so sure - sometimes they
agree, sometimes they don't."
In court yesterday, prosecutors
stressed that Winterburn's and
Risk's testimonies did not qualify
as "new evidence," and alleged
that Judge Sindt's decision was
incorrect. The prosecution added
hippie," she said. "But the military
workers who devote their lives to
delivering care in a humanitarian
fashion are true American heroes."
Though many who journeyed to
Haiti to assist in the relief efforts
were medically trained, the need
stretches far beyond physicians and
doctoral care.
Conjeevaram said he quickly
realized rehabilitation was more
than just a medical process because
victims are in need of food, water
and other forms of care that have
not been readily available to them
since the earthquake.
"I was seeing patients and saying
things like, 'Take this tablet three
times a day with your meals,' " he
said. "And then the next question
they would ask was, 'But where is
my next meal coming from?"'
Lozon said oftentimes helping
her patients didn't involve her med-
ical skills.
"There was a little orphaned
boy that everybody fell in love with
aboard the boat," she said. "He had
a terrible medical problem and he
was developmentally delayed and
very scared. All he wanted to do
was be held and I'd be happy to do
that."
Though earthquake victims are
in dire need of aid, they're not the

that even if the testimonies were
classified as new evidence, they
were negligible pieces of evidence.
Plummer explained that pros-
ecuting attorneys "don't want
second guessing," of previous con-
victions.
But with the growing ability to
find new evidence through pro-
cesses like DNA testing, previously
closed cases are being reexamined,
Syed explained.
"The prosecution is very con-
cerned that if these types of cases
only ones in the country that need
help. Conjeevaram said since a lot
of focus is heavily concentrated on
disaster related injuries, people
with other problems are often for-
gotten.
"The main three hospitals in
Port-Au-Prince are inundated with
emergency surgeries," he said. "At
times the day-to-day patients who
just need their blood pressure med-
ication or their diabetes medication
are overlooked."
In addition, now that the rainy
season is approaching - which
Conjeevaram said spreads dust and
causes illness - medical care is
becomingeven more necessary.
Hausler said he "sensed a feeling
of dread" from the Haitian people
because of the recent onset of the
rainy season.
"It's already starting to rain
now," he said. "People do not have
their homes and they are becoming
terrified."
Though the relief workers have
many stories of desperation and
pain, they also have a few of hap-
piness.
Conjeevaram told of being
recruited by army officers to aid a
woman dying of starvation because
she had to feed and support her
children and grandchildren.

keep getting through, then it might
open the flood gates and everyone
would get to file new motions,"
Syed said.
Syed and Plummer explained
that while Swain has had a difficult
road so far, she is optimistic about
the outcome of the appeal.
"I think she just has a genuine
feeling that in the end, the right
thing will happen," Plummer said,
adding that Swain has found work
near her home and has a lot of sup-
port from her community.
"I was able to feed her some gra-
nola bars," he said. "And when we
came back, she was a completely
different person; it had helped her
so much. It was so touching to be
able to help someone and the army
officerswere so happy to have made
a difference."
Lozon said she felt a similar sen-
timent after caring for a mother
and daughter - both of whom had
their legs shattered during the
earthquake.
"I was able to make sure that
they got their operations and see
them go back to the island as an
intact family with their legs fixed,"
she said. "That was very gratify-
ing."
Hausler said he was deeply
affected after carrying a three-
year-old Haitian girl with a
105-degree fever and possible case
of typhoid on a stretcher to a nearby
hospital.
"I just wanted to get there as fast
as possible, but I was watching out
for every rock," he said. "I want-
ed to have a heightened sense of
awareness of every single bump so
I wouldn't shake this little girl who
was sitting there practically dying."
Coming back to the U.S., Hausler
said it was difficult to explain his
experience to his peers who had

"She seems to be doing well,"
Plummer said.
Though Innocence Clinic mem-
bers say they are confident in their
arguments and Swain's innocence,
they admitted they are not com-
pletely sure they will be able to win
the case.
"The judges were interested
in the right questions, which is
good," Syed said. "But we really can't
know what they're thinking or where
they're going to go with it, so we're
hoping for the best."
only witnessed the disaster in the
media.
"All of a sudden, coming back
and stepping out of the destruction
you see how detached people are
from it and it can be hard to relate,"
he said.
Montas also stressed that stu-
dents should recognize how lucky
they are to live in a place where a
similar disaster would not be as
devastating.
"We have to remember, (in Haiti)
there's no disability insurance
and there's no Medicaid," he said.
"There's nothing like anything in
America where if something hap-
pened to you that you didn't plan
for, it would be taken care of by the
government or by the infrastruc-
ture."
All of the workers emphasized
that even if students do not have
medical training, there are many.

devastated buildings, aiding in
water reclamation or fetching tools
and supplies.
"There is a constant need," said
Conjeevaram. "And the truth is ;
when you actually do these things,
you grow as a person, and at the end
of the day it helps you more than r
the person you're helping."

Moundros tries his hand at defense*

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
Mark Moundros probably saw
the writing on the wall.
In Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez's spread offense, the fullback
wasn't going to be as vital as it had
been for past Michigan teams. No
more power-I formations on first-
and-10, that's for sure. So the senior
fullback decided to take matters
into his own hands - he asked the
coaching staff to let him play some
linebacker.
And that's where Moundros has
found himself this spring. But he
will be playing both sides of the
ball for the Wolverines, as he will
continue to play fullback as well.
Moundros perfectly suits the
fullback position in the sense that
he's a physical player. And with his
style of play, Moundros requested
to lay the hits on the offensive guys
instead of protecting them.
"Mark's a traitor - no, don't put
that in there," Magee joked last
week. "Mark's in the plans at full-
back. He's been that guy for a cou-
ple of years, we know he's there."
Last year, Moundros contrib-
uted on special teams in every
contest. But in Rodriguez's spread
offense, the Wolverines have used
a lot of two running back sets
instead of featuring a fullback. And

"I don't want to say it's a sur-
prise," Rodriguez said. "But a guy
who's shown he's goingtobe able to
help us over there is Mark Moun-
dros. We've really been pleased.
He'll still play a little bit of offense,
but our focus for all of spring, for
Mark, has been on defense to learn
that new position. He's got a lot
of intensity, he's a strong guy and
very passionate.
"I've really liked what I've seen
out of Mark playing over there. I
think it's a move that's probably
going to stick. And at the same time
probably help play some fullback."
Tackling people isn't anything"
new for the Farmington Hills
native, he has 15 career special
teams tackles. And though he
hasn't missed a game in three
years, he has just 10 career starts
at fullback.
Rodriguez added that the move
this spring has been smoother
because of the great spring that
redshirt junior fullback John
McColgan has had.
Moundros's impact certainly
has been meager, paving the way
for running backs or stopping a
returner in his tracks. But it is rec-
ognized.
He isn't the most decorated Wol-
verine, but Moundros will attempt
to prove his worth on both sides of
the ball this soon.

Graduating seniors Sroczynski and
Navas will leave M' with huge void.

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
Standing a combined 12 feet,
eight inches tall and weighing an
aggregate of 407 lbs, graduating
seniors George Navas and Mike
Sroczynski will leave a huge void
to fill for the Michigan men's ten-
nis team (6-1 Big Ten, 10-8 overall).
It's not just their size that the
Wolverines will miss.
Since arriving as blue-chip
recruits in 2006, the two athletes
have been invaluable to the team,
earning 149 and 147 career match
victories, respectively.
"They've both been integral
parts of the success we've had,"
Michigan coach Bruce Berque said.
"Carrying the program back to one
that is not only challenging for con-
ference championships, but one
that's also relevant on the national
level.
"They've also taken owner-
ship in creating the identity that
the team is going to need to have
in future years to get to the next
level, and I'm confident that when
they're done here they will have
left the program in better shape
than it was when they got here. I
think that that's a nice compliment
to them and something they should
be really proud of"
The pair is currently the No.
38 doubles team in the nation and
he's been rotating at the No. 1 and
No. 2 doubles spots with the pair
of junior Jason Jung and fresh-
man Evan King. After not playing
together since freshman year, they
are currently an impressive 13-6
against top competition, including
a win over the then-No. 20 doubles
team in the nation and a tiebreaker
loss to the No.2 tandem.
"It's weird," Navas said. "When
we were trying to decide what the
doubles teams were going to be, I
told Bruce (Berque) that I had a gut
feeling that me and Mike would be
really successful together. I don't
know if it's because we played
together freshman year, but we
have pretty good chemistry on the
court, we always know what each
other is doing."
Navas' the team captain, has
been a mainstay for the Wolverines
primarily at the No. 4 singles spot.
He has a 6-1 Big Ten singles record,

Senior George Navas and Mike Sroczynski are the No. 38 doubles team in the nation.

conference.
Sroczynski, a self-described
aggressive baseliner with a big
serve, has played mostly at the No.
3 spot and has a 3-4 Big Ten singles
record.
Throughout their four-year
careers, Navas and Sroczynski
have accomplished great things.
They were vital parts of Michigan's
Sweet 16 appearance in 2008, a
moment that they both acknowl-
edged as the highlight of their
experiences.
Sroczynski was also the 2008
Wilson/ITA Midwest Regional
doubles champion, winning the
title with Jung.
The two are good friends off
the court, despite being polar
opposites. They roomed together
freshman year, but Navas's need
for cleanliness didn't exactly mesh
well with Mike's style of living.
"The quality of his living situ-
ations are subpar," Navas said. "In
the dorm room, it was pretty dis-
gusting, and I'm a clean person.
Not to put it all on Mike, but yeah,

it's pretty much all on Mike. It was
just atrocious. Not the cleanest guy
in terms of living.
"We're good friends. Mike is a
big goofball, basically. He's a big
guy, and can be intimidating if you
don't know him, but he's really laid-
back and funny."
Though both Navas and Sroc-
zynski are going to miss the colle-
giate game and their relationships
on the tight-knit seven-man roster,
they already have plans for their
post-college lives. And like their
personalities, their plans are com-
pletely different.
Navas, an economics major, will
be working for Bank of America in
Charlotte, NC.
He made it clear that he's loved
his time on the tennis team, but
that his experience was about so
much more than the tennis, and
he's ready to move on.
But Sroczynski isn't givingup on
tennis just yet.
"My plans for next year as of
now are to play." Sroczynski said.
"I think I'm gonna give it a shot,

play some tournaments once tennis
is done here after I'm done graduat-
ing. And just see how it goes, give
myself a shot. I figure I've put a lot
into tennis, and I'd like to continue
that after my playing days here are
over."
The two know how important
they have been to the resurrection
of Michigan tennis, from a team
that had missed the NCAA Tourna-
ment for several years before they
arrived, to one that has made it five
consecutive years.
The two imposing figures -
Srocynski is 6-foot-6 and 220 lbs,
Navas 6-foot-1 and 187 - will be
tough to replace,but they have done 4
everything they can to prepare the
team for life without them.
"I want my legacy to be that I
helped Bruce develop the program
into what he wants to be," Navas
said. "Which is successful year in
and year out, good character guys
who want to work hard.It's tough
to do that, it's tough to get to that
point, but I think the team is finally
there."

Who is softball's No.l starter?

Speierman starts for
Wolverines, finds

0

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Writer
The question has been posed
before: who is the number-one
starter for the No. 2 Michigan soft-
ball team?
It's really not a critical question.
The rotation consists of two equal-
ly dominant hurlers, and thus the
players and coaches don't really
ask it.
But sometimes people get curi-
ous.
With each complete game shut-
out that junior Jordan Taylor and
senior Nikki Nemitz throw, the
question becomes more difficult to
answer.
They're both All-Americans.
They both have an ERA below two.
Taylor has 16 wins in 21 appear-
ances, and Nemitz has 13 in 17.
But in the beginning of the sea-
son, the answer wasn't nearly as
ambiguous. Taylor was the hot
hand. And it appeared that she
had assumed the number-one spot
over the elder Nemitz.
As Nemitz stumbled to a 1-3
record to open the season, Taylor
surged ahead and won in her first
five starts before taking a loss in
a 2-1 pitchers' duel to then-No. 6
Missouri.
Taylor consistently got the nod
for three games in the five-game
weekend road trips. She stifled
some of the strongest top-to-bot-
tom lineups in the nation. And her
only two losses have come against

same dominant results

Senior Nikki Nemitz started the season 1-3, but has been arguably the Wolverines' best pitcher as of late.

top-15 opponents.
Even with those conspicuous
indicators, Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins wouldn't answer the
question.
"I have two All-American pitch-
ers," Hutchins said.
But everybody could see it. The
early-season box scores revealed
the number-one and number-two
pitchers.
Now, it's not so easy.
Since Big Ten play opened three
weeks ago, both pitchers have been
tossing the ball phenomenally.
Nemitz has won all three of her
starts, giving up just one run. Tay-
lor has won all four of hers, and
she also upped the ante by throw-

ing her first career perfect game at
Minnesota last weekend.
As Nemitz's resurgence
becomes reality, and as the Wol-
verines inch closer to postseason
play, the question pops back into
relevance.
Who will be number one on
May 21, the first day of the NCAA
regionals?
Who knows? Only one thing
remains certain - you're not going
to find out from Hutchins.
INJURY REPORT: Sophomore
shortstop Stephanie Kirkpatrick
has been inactive for the last six
games with a torn meniscus in her
left knee.
Hutchins revealed today that

she will likely be out for at least
the next two weeks, but she is
expected to be ready for postsea-
son action. She is scheduled for a
minor surgical procedure today.
"She was going to try to play
through it, but she's just not
mobile enough," Hutchins said.
"The good thing is we know she'll
work really hard."
With her absence from the
field, the defense has been moved
around quite a bit, as senior Molly
Bausher - an everyday center-
fielder - has temporarily filled
in at shortstop. Sophomore Bree
Evans moved from left to center,
and senior Kristen Larsen came
off the bench to occupy left.

By ALEX HERMANN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team took
a short break from pummeling Big
Ten schools
to play its C. MICHIGAN 0
second MICHIGAN 8
Mid-Amer-
ican Conference opponent of the
year yesterday.
But the result was still the same,
as the Wolverines beat Central
Michigan 8-0.
One thing was noticeably dif-
ferent for Michigan, as freshman
pitcher Stephanie Speierman took
the mound in her first career start.
The righty gave up no runs and
allowed just one hit through five
innings.
"I was very excited," Speierman
said after the game. "I was a little
nervous the first inning, and then I
sort of settled in. Then it was play-
ing softball."
The lone hit was a disputed
grounder to the third baseline in
the fifth inning. Senior third base-
man Maggie Viefhaus made a div-
ing catch to corral the ball but
couldn't get it to first base in time.
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
came out to discuss whether or
not the ball had rolled foul or not.
The tough call notwithstanding,
Hutchins remained impressed with
the young pitcher's one-hitter per-
formance.
"I wanted to see what she could
do when the game was more mean-
ingful, as opposed to coming in a
mop-up type of inning when we've
been ahead," Hutchins said. "I was
really pleased with her. I thought
she was composed, she made her
pitches and she did a really nice
job."
The defense behind her was
excellent also, as Speierman struck
out just three batters, allowing the
Chippewas (17-3) to put plenty of
balls into play. The defense did not
commit an error.
"The whole team in general
was doing a great job, which I
really appreciated," Speierman
said. "Knowing that the defense is
behind me definitely makes it eas-

ier."
The defensive performance was
even more impressive considering
sophomore shortstop Stephanie
Kirkpatrick has missed the last six
games due to injury. This has forced
Hutchins to rotate the defense with
senior Molly Bausher moving from
centerfield to fill Kirkpatrick's posi-
tion in the infield.
"This seems to have happened
almost every year," Bausher said.
"Somebody has gone down and
somebody has to fill in - and that
somebody usually is me. Yeah, it's
tough to deal with, but having to
deal with it in previous years has
kind of given me an understanding
and (made me) comfortable withO
the situation."
Bausher also got it done at the
plate, capping off a six-run fifth
inning with a two-run RBJ double
to centerfield, effectively ending
the game due to softball's eight-run
mercy rule.
It was the fourth game in a row
Michigan (7-0 Big Ten, 31-5 over-
all) has ended the game in the fifth
inning and the seventh time in the
last nine games.
Junior first baseman Dorian
Shaw was the other major contribu-
tor in the fifth, nailing a home run
into the Alumni Field scoreboard
with two teammates on base. The
homer was her 14th of the season,
which leads the team and ties her
career high from last year.
But outside of that, the offense
- or at least the hitting - was non-
existent. Still, Wolverine batters
reached base on nine walks, despite
having just four hits on the day.
The only one of those hits that
came before the fifth inning was
sophomore Amanda Chidester's in
the first. Central Michigan's pitch-
er loaded the bases with three-
straight walks, givingChidester the
opportunity to drive in two runs on
a single.
Michigan has now won 10
straight and 23 of the last 24.
"Our team is very competitive
and we're explosive and it is hard
to keep us down," Hutchins said.
"They have a lot of confidence in
their game right now."

BARA R
GOOD TIME CHARLEY'S
There are few things nicer than spend-
ing the first glorious days of summer
drinking a Long Island iced tea on a
sunny patio. This fact, among many
others, is why Good Time Charley's remains
one of the most popular student bars in Ann
Arbor, with lines out the door once tempera-
tures reach above freezing. With a wide out-
door patio, in addition to better-than-passable
food, generous drink specials and a preemptive
smoking ban, Charley's remains the go-to spot
for the 21+ set - or those with a decent fake. On
certain high-volume nights, the attentive staff
will even serve beer outside while bar-goers
wait on line: That's service. After all, you bet-
ter be more than a little buzzed before you can
entertain the idea of stumbling over to Rick's.

SUSHI
SADAKO
You know you're eat-
ing poorly rolled sushi
when it falls apart the
moment your chop-
sticks unite with the outer sea-
weed/rice layer, leaving nothing
but a dismantled crab-cuc-avo
corpse all over your plate - the
worst. But this is never a prob-
lem at Sadako, this year's Best
of Ann Arbor winner for sushi.
Here, the rolls are tight and
together and always fresh and
delicious. Couple this stress-free
sushi eating experience with a

serene restaurant atmosphere -
walls and waitstaff all outfitted
in a soothing baby blue. Though
sometimes slightly overpriced,
all's well because the restaurant
splurges on the smooth chop-
sticks that don't give you splin-
ters, and if you order more than
$6 of food, you get acomplemen-
tary miso soup and a mysterious
orange dressingsalad that tastes
delicious. Sadako, a previous

nitely stays raw.

PIZZA
THE ORIGINAL COTTAGE INN
The secret to a great Italian restau-
rant isn't just the food, though The
Original Cottage Inn certainly
delivers on that front. No, it's the
ambiance. And this Ann Arbor mainstay
knows how to present a gourmet Italian
atmosphere so coinplete you forget you're
eating next to a giant construction pit. The
eatery's two levels of ivy-colored brick
quaintness make you feel like you've just
stepped in from a Roman piazza, as does
the generous portion of olive oil your server
pours for dipping your bread. Then you taste
the deep-dish pizza, with its perfect sea-
soning and crunchy-doughy crust, and you
realize why groups like the Glee Club will
routinely take over the entire place: Italian
food this good begs to be shared with a few
dozen of your closest friends.

SANDWICHES
ZINGERMAN'S
ingerman's Delicates-
sen is what puts Ann
Arbor on the foodie
map. Though the famous
sandwiches are pretty pricey,
you're paying for quality, and the
food doesn't disappoint. From
the famous #2 Zingerman's Reu-
ben stacked with sauerkraut and
tasty corned beef to the lesser-
known, but still delicious #73
Tarb's Tenacious Tenure turkey
sandwich smothered in avocado
and Wisconsin muenster cheese,
all can find something fresh and
flavorful to sink their teeth into.
Zingerman's has a fun, relaxed
dining atmosphere and a mouth-
watering selection of deli meats,
cheeses, breads, desserts and
more kinds of olives than you've
ever heard of. Best of all, parents
love taking their college kids to
Zingerman's, so milk that for all
it's worth. Calories don't count at

BURGERS
QUICKIE BURGER
Lorated on the corner of Hill
and State, this small cor-
ner joint offers aromas that
grab the nostrils of every
passerby. The oversized burger
puts the Big Mac to shame in its
weight and quality, though its
"quickie" nickname is not refer-
ring to the taste: Its taste lingers
long after eating. Even if you
already ate a burger and fries on
top of that box of Franzia you pol-
ished off an hour ago, you'll still
consider eating another. The best
part about Quickie, though, isn't
getting the food. It's sitting in the
maize-and-blue interior with the
view of State St., making awk-
ward eye contact with the guy
from your English class as you
shove that huge burger in your
mouth. Conversations via Quick-
ie window are a one-of-a-kind
experience - nothing says friend-
ship like a wave at a familiar face
through the Quickie glass.

BURRITO
CHIPOTLE
Dear Chipotle,
Thank you for being the
most dependable, most
delicious burrito place in
all of Ann Arbor. Don't let any hat-
ers tell you otherwise. They haven't
yet learned how to look past your
cold, metallic appearance (seriously,
is it necessary to make customers
feel like they've just stumbled into

a robot factory?) and appreciate
what makes you so great: the simple
elegance of your menu, the hearty
chunks of grilled chicken in your
flagship item, the non-mushy beans
and the option of corn that makes
the burrito all the more satisfying.
But the rest will come around to you
eventually, once people realize that
sometimes burritos should actually

taste good when consumed while
sober. Which brings me to a pressing
matter: Guys, you have to start stay-
ing open late. Nobody in their right
mind has ever said, "Boy, this bur-
rito place would be so much better if
it closed at 10 p.m."
Sincerely,
A burrito lover

Cheap (almost noth-

and delicious - Jerusalem
Garden is any student's dream
dining destination. Jerusalem
Garden serves up sizeable por-

alike. Some of its specialties
include shawarma, falafel with

hummus, stuffed grape leaves,

Though some of the traditional
Middle Eastern food might
sometimes lack spice, Jerusa-
lem Garden puts its own unique
spin on many of the dishes and
everything is consistently fresh

your best option given the lim-

extremely quick, and the staff
is friendly and helpful. When
the snow and clouds finally
dissipate over Ann Arbor, the
patio opens for service, further
adding to the relaxed atmo-

CLUB
5TH QUARTER
Top 40 fare, moderately
priced drinks and a
giant mechanical bull.
What's not to love
about 5th Quarter? If you're
over 21 and prefer to spend
your boozy nights without hav-
ing your ears blasted off by the
Black Eyed Peas, you can prob-

ably name several things. But
that's part of the charm of 5th
Quarter. With an 18+ age limit,
the venue entices rambunc-
tious underclassmen who share
a taste for sweaty dance floors
and illicitly consuming alcohol
in club bathrooms. Although
most Michigan students

migrate to the even sleazier
Rick's once they hit the exalt-
ed 21st birthday, 5th Quarter
offers a fitting introduction to
the joys of dirty dancing, casual
hookups and Blue Balls - the
rum-and-blue-curacao mixed
drink, that is.
