Researchers clear major hurdle,
can now accept donated embryos

Controversial change
would have lessened
burden of proof for
student violations
By MALLORY JONES
Daily Staff Reporter
The Michigan Student Assembly
voted last night to retract the most
contentious of seven recommend-
ed changes the body made for the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities earlier this semes-
ter.
MSA had previously endorsed
an amendment to the student code
that would lower the standard of
evidence needed in a case brought
against astudentthrough theOffice
of Student Cunflict Resolution.
But more debate on the topic -
prompted by concern expressed by
members of the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs
- brought forth an opinion among
some members that the original
recommendation was made with
mostly sexual assault victims in
mind, and that the lower standard
might not be appropriate for other
types of complaints. .

Currently, OSCR requires a clear
and convincing standard to find
a student guilty of violating the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities - the main docu-
ment that governs studentbehavior
and activity on campus.
On Oct. 6, MSA approved a rec-
ommendation that the standard of
evidence be lowered to a prepon-
derance of the evidence standard.
LSA Rep. Vickie Hwang, who
co-authored the original resolution
along with LSA Rep. Adam DeSan-
tis, said the idea was to increase
the likelihood of a victim of sexual
assault coming forward.
MSA retracted the recommenda-
tion last night in a 14-13 vote, with
three representatives abstaining.
A preponderance of the evidence
is defined as "the greater weight of
the evidence," whereas the clear
and convincing standard requires
that the accusation be proven
"highly probable or reasonably cer-
tain," according to Central Student
Judiciary Justice Ryan Particka,
who read from Black's Law Dic-
tionary.
At its core, the amendment would
have lessened the burden needed to
punish a student for violating the
Statement of Student Rights and

Approval makes way
for first major 'U'
project since voters
lifted restrictions
By GRACELIN BASKARAN
Daily StaffReporter
More than a year after Michi-
gan voters passed an amendment
allowing embryonic stem cell lines

to be created in the state, Univer-
sity scientists have finally received
approval to accept donated embry-
os - a necessary step for research-
ers to begin developing stem cell
lines.
With the recent go-ahead from
two University oversight boards,
University researchers will be able
to use the donated embryos to start
the first major stem cell research
project since the passage of a state-
wide proposal last November that
reduced restrictions on stem cell

research in Michigan. Through
the project, researchers will use
donated embryos to create the
University's first human embry-
onic stem cell lines.
Eva Feldman, director of the
Alfred Taubman Medical Research
Institute, announced the approval
yesterday during a speech to the
Detroit Economic Club.
Proposal 2, a ballot initiative
passed by state voters in November
2008, allows researchers to derive
embryonic stem cell lines from

donated embryos.
But without the approval
from the University's Human
Pluripotent Stem Cell Research
Oversight Committee and the
Medical School's institutional
Review Board - announced yes-
terday - researchers couldn't
move forward with their plan to
create a human stem cell line.
The project was approved on
Nov. 11, according to a University
press release.

DPS Oversight fixes

Proposal would put
0 election of student
representatives to
campus-wide vote
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
A resolution proposed last
night at the Michigan Student
Assembly meeting would allow
the student body to vote for the
two student members of the

Department of Public Safety
Oversight Committee.
The proposed resolution comes
after The Michigan Daily pub-
lished an article on Nov. 16 high-
lighting a series of problems with
the DPS Oversight Committee,
including analysis from indepen-
dent lawyers who said that the
assembly's current appointment
process for representatives may
violate state law.
Although state law requires stu-
dent, faculty and staff members of
the DPS Oversight Committee to
be "nominated and elected" to the

committee by the each constitu-
ency group, MSA has in recent
years appointed students to serve.
MSA President Abhishek Mah-
anti, who co-authored the reso-
lution, urged MSA members to
support it to ensure the assem-
bly would no longer violate state
law. He also said that many of the
members were motivated to get a
resolution on the table after first
hearing about the issue.
"It's nice that the entire assem-
bly got behind (the issue) to fig-
ure out what can be done to go

Intern In Michigan
matches students
with employers
By SUZANNE JACOBS
For the Daily
About half of Michigan college
students leave the state once they
graduate - a sobering fact that

significantly hampers the state's
prospects for future economic and
job growth.
But Intern In Michigan, a
joint project between the Detroit
Regional Chamber and West
Michigan Strategic Alliance, is
an initiative launched earlier this
year that seeks to remedy the
state's brain drain.
Intern In Michigan matches
college students with prospective

employers through a website with a
model similar to an Internet dating
service. The programwaslaunched
this past April and already has more
than 7,000 student and 700 employ-
er profiles, according to Greg Han-
del, senior director of workforce
development for the Detroit Cham-
ber of Commerce.
Britany Affolter-Caine, the
director of Intern In Michigan, said

Officials point to

With a treacherous job market
and a dismal economy, recently
released numbers show that more
students are electing to take the
Graduate Record Examination
and apply to graduate school

instead of looking for jobs after
they graduate.
Statistics provided by Educa-
tional Testing Service, the com-
pany that administers the .GRE,
show there has been a 13-percent
increase this year over last year in
the number of students taking the
GREin the United States.
The GRE is used as an admis-
sions test for graduate school. The
test is made up of three sections:
verbal reasoning, quantitative
reasoning and analytical writing.
While ofAcials from the compa-

ny point to several reasons for the
increase, the most clear-cut one is
simply that students are looking at
graduate school in larger numbers
in this tough job market.
Mark McNutt, ETS manager
of media relations, said histori-
cally the number of people who
take the GRE increases during
a recession. He added that one
cause of this may be that individ-
uals with advanced degrees are
more likely to find jobs once they
leave school.

A philanthropic endeavor

The University's chapter of Circle
K has about 1,200 Facebook frietnds
and is in a relationship with Michaigan
Stare University's chapter of the club,
but "it's complicated."
Circle K in an international service
organization that participates its a
variety of service projects and helps
lead on- and off-campus groups in
incercommunicy service, including
partnership with neighboring colleg-
es - like Michigan State University.
The club is the college division of
Kiwanis - an international service
organization with differenthbranches,
including Key Club at the high school
level.
Though itsname doesn't suggestcit,
volunteering is at the heart of Circle
K. The campus club as a whole has a
10,000 service hour goal for this year
and currently has logged about 6,825
service hours so far, according to LSA
junior Natalie Kittikul, the club's sec-
retary.
While there is no service hour

requirement for general tmembers,
the organization offers an extensive
calendar filled witha multiple projects
each day.
"We offer a lot of different proj-
ects, from helpisag children to play-
inghbingo with the elderly to planting
trees," said LSA senior Alli Schaffner,
the club's vice president.
Schaffner said Circle K is the per-
fectcorganization for busy college stu-
dents who are looking for ways to give
back to the community because of the
variety and frequency of events.
Students can also use Circle K
activities to fill philanthropic or ser-
vice requirenments.
Circle K'shbiggest'event is its atnnual
Service Day in which the club spends
24 hours doing continuous service
project4, accordingcto KittikulAtcthis
year's Service Day in November, the
club had 397 participants working
on 77 different service projects, like
bucketing for Dance Marathon and
tutoring high school students.

Kittikul said club members arenn't
"just a number" to Circle K leaders.
"We actually want you to set up
your own projects and go to thena,"
she said. "We'll help you recruit vol-
unteers."
Club leaders said participants can
sign up on Circle K's virtual calendar
on the University chapter's website,
which they say makes it easier to be
active in the organization.
According-to the club's president,
Charlie Cure, this method encour-
ages club and non-club metmbers
alike to participate in service oppor-
tunities.
"We have a virtual sign-up system,
so anyone on campus can click on
a project, fill out their information,
read a description and then sign up
right there," Goelz said.
Schaffner said Circle K service
projects have spawned many other
University groups like The Detroit
Partnership and K-granns.

Ex-FBI director to
conduct review of
Fort Hood shootings
Ex-FBI director William Webster
will conduct an independent review
ofthe bureau's handling of informa-
tion gathered about the Fort Hood
shooting suspect before the deadly
rampage, officials said yesterday.
FBI Director Robert Mueller has
asked Webster to take a look at how
the bureau handled information
about Maj.Nidal Hasan in the months
before the shooting at the Texas mili-
tary base that killed 13 people.
Mueller had already ordered an
internal review of the matter, and
that review led to a secret report to
the White House in late November.
The new assignment for Webster
takes the internal review a step fur-
ther, and likely means a more pro-
longed, in-depth inquiry. Webster
is a former judge who also served as
C5A director.

In a statement, Mueller called
Webster "uniquely qualified" for the
job because he "has led independent
reviews of various FBI systems and
broader policies and provided valu-
able recommendations. In this case,
Judge Webster will have complete
access and whatever resources nec-
essary to complete the task."

a wave of coordinated attacks yes-

The blasts - at least five in
total - marked the third major
strike on government sites since
August and brought uncomfort-
able questions for Iraqi leaders.
These include signs al-Qaida in
Iraq is regrouping and concerns
over the readiness of Iraqi forces

forces depart.
The bombings also brought
swift accusations about the

Responsibilities.
When the amendment first
passed the assembly in October, it
was grouped with a series of other
amendments, including changing
the Statement's language to make
it gender-neutral, and designat-
ing intimate partner violence as a
distinct violation. The assembly
passed all the recommendations at
that time without debate.
After talking to University pro-
fessors and administrators from
SACUA, MSA President Abhishek
Mahanti decided the assembly
should re-visit its decision to sup-
port the change in the standard of
evidence.
Mahanti said the amendments
were presented to the assembly a
week before they were voted upon,
but the representatives did not
thoroughly look them over.
"That process assumes that
individuals would take time to
look at it and gather evidence and
arguments," Mahanti said. "What
alarmed me was that it all passed
by consent."
When a proposal is brought
before MSA, the matter is not
debated before the full body unless
there is an objection from one its
members. Without an objection,
the resolution passes by consent.

motives behind the attacks. Offi-
cials claimed a Sunni insurgent
alliance, including members of
Saddam Hussein's banned Baath
Party, seeks to undermine the
pro-Western government ahead of
elections set for March 7 and the
later withdrawal of U.S. combat
forces.
Authorities also faced angry
questions about how bombers
again found holes in Iraqi secu-
rity.
"If security falls apart, then
everything will collapse," said
Abbas al-Bayati, head of parlia-
ment's defense committee and an
ally of the Shiite government, as
lawmakers convened an emergen-
cy session.
Another lawmaker, Saadi al-
Barazanji, shouted: "If I were the
interior minister, I would resign!"
The attacks began with a sui-
cide strike on a police patrol. An
hour later, four more explosions
rumbled across Baghdad in the
MSA, along with University
executive officers and SACUA, is
given the opportunity to amend
the Statement every three years.
The changes that MSA approved
in October were sent to SACUA,
which reviews them and ultimate-
ly decides whether to recommend
them to University President Mary
Sue Coleman for implementation.
With or without SACUAs recom-
mendation, MSA's amendments
are sent to Coleman.
Hwang, co-author of the origi-
nal resolution, said that after pre-
senting these changes to SACUA
and hearing their debate on the
change, she realized that MSA
had not adequately discussed the
amendment.
"When we initially proposed it
we didn't realize that there were
so many other aspects of it and so
many other implications that we
had to consider," Hwang said.
MSA Treasurer Vishal Bajaj,
who only votes in the event of a
tie, voted in favor of the resolution.
He said that while he supports the
efforts of those trying to make the
process easier for victims of sexual
assault, he doesn't support chang-
ing the standard for all 20 viola-
tions in the Statement.
Beth Sullivan, a representative
from the Center for the Education
of Women, came to last night's
MSA meeting and urged the
assembly to support the change

span of a few minutes. Suicide
car bombings hit three sites: the
main Appeals Court, an area out-
side the Finance Ministry and
a government compound that
includes the Labor Ministry. A
roadside bomb also went off near
a university.
Iraq's Health Ministry reported
at least 513 people were wounded.
There was no immediate claim
of responsibility. However, mul-
tiple bombings are a hallmark
of al-Qaida. The past two major
strikes on Iraqi government sites
were coordinated blasts in August
and October that took more than
255 lives. Sunni groups linked to
al-Qaida eventually issued state-
ments saying they carried out the
attacks.
Iraq'sgovernment, however, has
tried to cast blame on Saddam loy-
alists - even parading three sus-
pects on national television who
gave what officials termed confes-
sions for the October attacks.
to a preponderance of evidence
standard. She said that most uni-
versities adhere to this standard.
According to Sullivan, the judi-
cial body of the Greek system uses
the preponderance of evidence
standard in all of its cases. Sullivan
read to the assembly a statement
from Max Barack, the Judicial
Vice President of the Interfrater-
nity Council. In his statement, he
urged the assembly to keep its rec-
ommendation to lower the stan-
dard of evidence.
MSA Vice President Mike Rorro,
who voted against last night's
proposal, said that the assembly
should take into consideration
that the Greek system has already
made this change and MSA.should
recommend the University do the
same.
Rules and Elections Chair
Michael Benson said this change
would endanger those accused of
violating the code.

STEM CELLS
From PageA
"Before today, we didn't have
all of the approvals (from the
Institutional Review Board),"
Sue O'Shea, director of the Uni-
versity's Center for Human
Embryonic Stem Cell Biology,
said in an interview yesterday.
"Today we've finally cleared all
the hurdles."
The University's Consortium
for Stem Cell Therapies - an
organization that brings together
researchers from across campus
and from Michigan State Univer-
sity and Wayne State University
- will be responsible for deriving
the stem cell lines.
The consortium is now able
to accept donated embryos that
were created for reproductive
purposes but were discarded
either because they weren't
needed anymore or they couldn't
be used, according to the release.
The consent of the donor must
be documented in writing before
the stem cells can be turned over
to the consortium, in accordance
with federal and state laws.
Two million dollars of fund-
ing for the new research will
come from two private organi-
zations, the Alfred A. Taubman
Medical Research Institute and
the Consortium for Stem Cell
Therapies. -
A current federal law states
that taxpayer dollars, including
those from the National Insti-
tutes of Health, cannot be used to
develop new stem cell lines. Once
lines are developed, however,
government funding can be used
to cover the research.
According to the release, Uni-
versity researchers expect to cre-
ate their first embryonic stem cell
line by 2010.
In addition to deriving embry-
onic lines, consortium scientists
will also work on techniques
to convert adult skin cells into
induced pluripotent stem cells,
which function like embryonic
cells, making them extremely
valuable for research purposes.
Accordingto O'Shea, the recent
approval allows University scien-
tists to begin this groundbreak-
ing research.
"It's tremendously important,"
O'Shea said. "For one, the exist-
ing stem cell lines out there don't
represent the world's population
so now we have the tools to let us
make more genetically diverse

lines."
With the approval, consortium
scientistshcan also begin the pro-
cess of creating stem cell lines
fromhdisease-carrying patients,
which will help them develop
treatments for a variety of dis--
eases.
"We want to obtain cells from:
diabetics or people with Par-"
kinson's because once there's an'
embryonic stem cell line, we have"
thousands of cells and we can try
different treatments, so we can"*
study disease progression along'
with new medications," O'Shea
said.
Although the loosening of-
the research restrictions was
approved last year, groundwork
for this project began long before-
the votes were cast.
"We've been working on this
project for several years - even-
before Proposal 2 was on the bal-.
lot," O'Shea said. "We couldn't
do any of the work we're doing if
Proposal 2 had failed because it
was illegal to make new lines in
the state of Michigan."
Feldman said researchers will-
start collecting embryos at the'
beginning of the new year and*
will progressively increase their
intake of donors' embryos.
"We need to understand and
become efficient with making
lines before I cansay we canmake
30 or 40 lines," Feldman said.
"We'll start in a very measured
way to make sure we have all the
operating procedures worked out-
correctly."
According to Feldman, in the
past year, many potential donors
have expressed interest in donat-
ing their embryos for research.
"We estimate we will receive
between 40 and 200 donors
over the first year or so. We will
begin by accepting embryos from
donors where we expect the
embryos to be normal so we can
develop initial lines," she said.
Though the state constitu-
tional amendment passed last'
year, there is still some opposi-
tion to stem cell research in the
state. A group of state legislators,
led by Sen. Tom George (R-Kal-
amazoo), will present bills to the
Senate Health Policy Commit-.
tee today that could restrict the
state's stem cell research.
"It would certainly hinder our
project in a big way," O'Shea said.
"It's just an attempt to further
regulate stem cell research. It
will impede our recruiting efforts
and make it harder for us."

Clearing the air
Michigan legislature must pass indoor smoking ban
Most people are familiar with the negative health risks
associated with smoking. To improve the health of
workplace environments, 37 states have enacted some
sort of statewide ban on indoor smoking in public places. While
the Michigan legislature has repeatedly taken up this issue, leg-
islators have been too stubborn to compromise and approve a bill.
With the state Senate likely to take up the issue again later this
week, legislators must finally agree on and pass a version of the
bill that will protect the health of workers and make reasonable
exceptions for certain businesses.

Expect the unexpected

Bills to ban smoking statewide aren't new
to the Michigan legislature. Last year, a bill
that would have banned smoking in public
areas like restaurants and bars died before
it reached the governor's desk. Ultimately,
the Senate and House of Representatives
couldn't agree on exempting some busi-
nesses from the law. The bill that the legis-
lature takes up later this week will likely be
similar, and will face a similar debate over
whether to make exceptions for businesses
like cigar bars and casinos.
The dangers of secondhand smoke are
the primary reason a smoking ban should be
enacted. According to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, 1,300 people
die from smoking-related causes every day
in the United States. Complications from
secondhand smoke are thought to be respon-
sible for 11 percent of these deaths. Most peo-
ple can lessen their risk by avoiding smokers,
but those who work in smoke-filled environ-
ments don't have that option. A smoking ban
would create environments free of health
risks for emnployees of restaurants and bars
who currently have no choice but to risk sec-
ondhand-smoke exposure to keep their jobs.
Critics of a ban have said that it would
hurt businesses, driving away custom-
ers who smoke. But the opposite may be
true. Smoke-free environments are attrac-

tive to potential customers. Non-smokers
could frequent establishments that they
may have previously avoided, as there are
far more non-smokers than smokers. And
evidence from states that have passed simi-
lar laws is good news for the ban. Tax rev-
enue and demand for liquor licenses, for
example, increased in New York after the
implementation of a similar indoor public
smoking ban.
That said, some exemptions to the ban are
understandable. It's probably unreasonable
to expect businesses that exist for the sole
purpose of smoking and tobacco use - like
cigar shops and smoke bars - to close their
doors to smoking. Losing the ability to let
their customers smoke would be tough for
them, and Michigan's economy can't afford
to lose any more small businesses. And it
could be expected that people who choose
to work in these establishments are aware
and accepting of the consequences of sec-
ondhand smoke.
If these exemptions are what this bill
needs in order to pass, the legislature
shouldn't mind them. Michigan workers in
bars and restaurants need the protection
that this bill will offer them. State legisla-
tors must not fail - once again - in their
obligation to protect employees from the
dangers of secondhand smoke.

t is hard for me to listen to our
president and members of his
economic team talk about finan-
cial matters with-
out laughing. I
understand that
they see the econ-
omy in the same
way that many
University students
see the world -
as a machine that
should only be
operated by those VINCENT
who understand it PATSY
best. They believe
that matters of eco-
nomic consequence
can only be trusted in the hands of an
elite group of policymakers, and they
label the rest of us with terms like
"capitalists" or the "labor force." For
them, our job title is our sole contribu-
tion to the overall economy.
This view is wrong. People are not
inanimate objects or cogs in some
economic machine. Everyone is a
capitalist, a laborer, a consumer and a
producer at the same time, and their
preferences simply can't be predicted
by even the most intelligent experts
in President Barack Obama's Cabinet
or in University lecture halls.
Economics, as a science, deals with
the fact that all people make deci-
sions that affect the world around
them in order to survive. Every per-
son has goals and some sort of idea
to achieve them. Economics does not
deal with how to attain these goals
or what these goals are - such topics
are covered by psychology, philoso-
phy and other disciplines.
No matter what you do, you are
making an economic decision. Every
decision to buy this food or that, hang
out with this friend or not or watch a

certain TV channel counts as an eco-
nomic decision. We subconsciously
order these preferences based on
their subjective value to us. In other
words, whatever you are doing right
now, (reading this column, for exam-
ple) ranked higher on your value
scale than other possible options
(like reading the lead story on the
front page).
obviously, your preference only
becomes obvious after the fact. I
can't predict what you were going to
do. I can only hope that by writing an
excellent column, I can attract read-
ers. I have no ability, no matter how
keen my insights into your mind, to
predict every action you make, and
therefore, I can't plan an econobmy
around you.
Of course, it makes sense that most
mainstream economists - and cer-
tainly the ones who have the presi-
dept's ear - do not stress this view.
Like many people, they don't want to
confess their limitations by admitting
the personal nature of economics.
These economists focus on deter-
mining if this or that political policy
would be better or worse. What is
lost is the key nature of economics,
namely that the field is largely based
on individual preferences that can't
be planned.
For example, if the supply of a
good falls, we don't know precisely
how much the price will fall because
we can't know consumers' subjec-
tive values. All we know is that laws
of economics exist that drive the
price downward. Economic laws tell
us direction and tendency of price
movements, not what the final num-
ber will be.
Inevitably, because they can't
accurately predict the market chang-
es, economists focus on long-run

equilibrium. The problem is that
they study a wholly unreal situation.
The world as it is today is one of con-
stant change. You don't know if later
today you will run into an old friend
or if you will be hit by a car. Prices of
goods, such as the stock market, are
constantly moving and changing in
an unpredictable manner.tBecause
the real world is difficult to model
mathematically, economists make
concessions and assumptions before
developing equilibriums. This is what
is studied in Econ 401 and 402 at the
University.
Economists can't
predict human
behavior.
For these economic models to work
in real life, we would need to live in
the world of Bill Murray in the movie
"Groundhog Day," constantly repeat-
ing the same actions over and over
again. Every person would need to
keep buying the same goods, walking
in the same shoes, spending each day
doing the same homework while lis-
teningto the same music, etc. But this
isn't the world we live in - nor one
we would ever want to live in.
In the real world, people can't be
treated as variables in an equation
that the state can manipulate to serve
some societal goal. This is the funda-
mental point of economics that most
experts either don't understand or
won't admit.

College too costly? Blame gov't

6

Economic issues typically don't
resonate with us college students,
as many of us are insulated against
the burden of taxes, unemployment,
outsourcing of jobs and even gas
prices. But one issue that unequivo-
cally affects college students is the
ever-increasing cost of tuition. The
best explanation I have heard for the
phenomenon was delivered in a few,
simple words: No government inter-
vention in education means no inflat-
ed tuition.
Before World War II, most Ameri-
cans didn't attend college. For indi-
viduals who did, it was inexpensive
relative to today's figures. In many
cases, the student worked for a few
years before or during school to save
up enough to pay for college and grad-
uated without debt.
This rarely happens today due to
the existence of an exorbitant num-
ber of government-guaranteed loans
and grants available to students. The
problem with such a system is the
development of an educational-indus-
trial complex in which individuals
become slaves to debt who are forced
to pay off loans long after graduation.
The benefactors of the scheme aren't
the students but rather the banks,
universities and politicians.
Tuition data for the University's
Law School show the effect of gov-
ernment intervention. Adjusted for
2009 values, yearly tuition at the
Law School in 1950 was $1,884 for
state residents and $4,037 for out-of-
state students. In 1950, the inflation-
adjusted, median personal income
was $18,103, meaning that students
would have earned enough to pay off
a year of tuition less than three

months.
Fast forward 60 years: tuition for
the Law School is currently $41,310
and $44,310 for in-state and out-
of-state students, respectively. The
median personal income is approxi-
mately $25,000. Today, the average
American would have to work more
than 18 months to afford a year of
tuition.
What caused the difference? Before
World War II, there were no govern-
ment loans or grants. When these
things did not exist, college was inex-
pensive and affordable. Government
intervention in education has caused
costs to skyrocket.
Besides driving up the cost of
education, the government is driv-
ing down its value. Since fewer indi-
viduals went to college before World
War II, people didn't stay in school
very long before they joined the work
force. Today, however, with guar-
anteed loans, droves of Americans
obtain college degrees. Thus, the
value of the degree has diminished.
This is basic supply and demand. To
stand out, a student must obtain a
graduate degree or Ph.D. These stu-
dents spend more years in college,
accumulate more debt and delay their
entrances into the work force, where
they can actually make money.
Today, anyone who wants to go to
college has access to a loan co-signed
by the government. Students then bid
and compete against one another for
spots at universities with government
money. There is no restraint on the
demand, which causes an increase
in prices. Universities love this, as it
enables them to increase admission
costsknowing that the gover ment

will guarantee the debt. If anything,
college tuitions should be decreas-
ing. We are currently in a recession
and demand for highly skilled work-
ers has diminished. Unemployment is
high, and incomes and the economy
are shrinking - yet college prices
continue to rise.
Could colleges afford to charge
$30,000 a year if government loans
did not exist to support this artifi-
cially created demand? The answer
should be obvious. These programs
mean that colleges have no incentive
to bring down costs.
Let's examine a hypothetical'sce-
nario. If the government announced
that it would eliminate educational
aid programs for the next fiscal year,
there would be a drastic decline in
enrollment. Most people wouldn't
be able to afford outrageous tuition
prices. Would this mean that colleges
would continue to operate with empty
classrooms or shut their doors and go
out of business? Of course not - cql-
leges would adapt by slashing outlays
to lower operation costs, which would
subsequently make attendance more
affordable for students.
Instead of having people go to col-
lege for a devalued degree and grad-
uate with 25 years of future debt,
students can work for a few years
after high school and gain valuable
real-world experiences before choos-
ing to obtain degrees for significantly
lower costs. The benefits of reconsid-
eringmisguided federal aid programs,
which have jacked up the price of a
college education while devaluing it
in the process, are crystal clear.

'NCAA Basketball 10' is
fun but flawed and
lacking in madness
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
Anybody remember Blake Griffin? For
Michigan basketball fans, he will most
likely bring back painful
memories of last year's
second-round loss in the
NCAA Basketball Tour- NCAA
nament at the hands of Bcetball10
the Oklahoma Sooners.
Now Griffin is front and XBox 360/PS3
center on the cover of EA EA Sports
Sports's latest "NCAA
Basketball 10" Time to
revisit the madness - it's college basketball
fever, baby!
First, let's get something out of the way.
Excluding titles like "NBA Street" and
"NBA Jam," basketball, in the most classi-
cal sense, is a very difficult sport to trans-
late into a fun video game. Constant motion
offenses and zone defenses can be dizzying
unless you're a seasoned veteran of Princ-
eton cuts, 1-3-1 traps and the like. Nonethe-
less, the game offers a stunning array of
options. As the head coach you can make
substitutions, change matchups, set game
plans before each game and make moves in
the post - everything short of talking to (or

screaming at) the ref.
Complete with updated rosters, rankings
and home-court advantages for, according
to the game, some of the "toughest places to
play," "NCAA" lets you play along with this
year's season. With an Internet connection,
the game actually updates rankings and ros-
ters over the course of a season.
For many, though, online updating might
be a nonfactor - choosing your own rivalry
matchups, no matter the current status of
the team, is always great. And for those still
sore about last year's tournament loss, pick
Michigan and have junior forward Manny
Harris and the boys give those Sooners a
good ass-kicking at Crisler Arena. Redemp-
tion is sweet, even with Griffin in the pros.
Perhaps the biggest flaw of "NCAA Bas-
ketball 10," as with other college basketball
video games, is that one star can dominate a
game so completely thatthe conceptof a team
falls by the wayside. While the game gives
you the option of controlling any ofyour play-
ers on the floor regardless of whether they
have the ball (nifty for open looks behind the
are, setting picks and making cuts), a quick
drive by an overpowering forward or a three-
pointer by a sharpshooting guard makes all
other options seem trivial.
Game developers have yet to figure out
a way to present the complicated sport of
college basketball in a fun and consistently
engagingway.Andthough runningfourlow-
motion offenses might be exciting for basket-
ball purists, EA can bet most of its audience
won't make much use of these things. Just

give the ball to Manny and watch what he
does with it - you're better off.
All complaints aside, the game looks pret-
ty fantastic. Gameplay is generally smooth
and even includes the signature graphics of
CBS Sports and ESPN along with color com-
mentary from their announcers (yes, Dick
Vitale included). Play as any Division I team
in any stadium in the country and feel the
fans shake up the screen for added intensity
toward the end of a game.
Mid-game, players' strengths are shown
underneath them (an orange "3" for good
shooters behind the arc, a red hand for
a good blocker, etc.), which is helpful in
choosing match-ups and judging where
and how to move your team. Difficulty lev-
els ranging from "Junior Varsity" to "All-
American" change the game significantly,,
affecting player speed, free throws (which
are pretty tough on any level) and whether
or not shots fall.
Aside from the exhibition mode Play
Now, you've got some options in terms of
how you like your college basketball served.
Those familiar with other recent EA Sports
games will recognize Dynasty Mode - a
multi-year coachingcareer for those in it for
the long -haul. Even better is NCAA Tour-
nament Mode, in which up to four players
can select teams and play through an entire
bracket. But those searching for the fever
pitch of true college basketball would be
smart to ditch the controller and wait until
March - there's little madness to be found
in "NCAA Basketball 10."

sists of six one-act $9
segments, each with
its own score with musical styles ranging
from pop-rock to more traditional musi-
cal theater tunes.
"The play takes place at six differ-
ent tourist locations, all with different
expectations of what people expect from
being there,"said Bret Wagner, Depart-
ment of Musical Theatre chair and "See
Rock City" director.
The plot doesn't follow the same char-
acters from start to finish. Each one-act
segment introduces new characters with
different sets of goals, challenges and
hopes for what they will discover on their
journey.
"Each (act) tells a different story, and
they are connected by a theme of people
trying to connect in relationships - dif-
ferent kinds of relationships," Wagner
said.
Audiences will be introduced to a
diverse set of characters: a vengeful,
recently dumped boyfriend hell-bent on
encountering intelligent life in Roswell,
N.M., two boys who play hooky from
Dalton School in New York City to go to
Coney Island and discover something
shocking, and a girl who ditches her
fianc6 at the altar in Niagara Falls. The
one constant character between each act,
called "The Tourist," acts as a conscience
for the hit-or-miss connections between
each character, guiding them through
their journeys.
"It's meant to have a cumulative
effect," Wagner said.
"It's brave of the writers because I
think when people see shows they don't
expect that. They expect a plot to follow
the characters all the way through."
Wagner believes that the common
themes between the different characters
and scenarios will be clear to the audi-
ence at the end: "I think you can relate
to the characters, but you kind of have to
let go of what preceded it and go to the
next."
Since this is the department's studio

production, the budget is limited and the
show is much smaller in scale.
"People aren't going to see large scen-
ery or rolling sets, so really it's a project
for the actors," Wagner explained.
Because only the department's black
rehearsal furniture is used to create the
six different locations explored in "See
Rock City," audiences will need to come
equipped with their imaginative think-
ing caps.
"It's a chance for the public to see the
work, the actors and to use their imagi-
nations," Wagner said.
The Department of Musical Theatre
tries to produce at least one new show
every year. This is because, according to
Wagner, when performance graduates
move to New York, a lot of their experi-
ences will be in an off-Broadway setting
working on new plays similar to "See
Rock City."
"I am trying to really prompt the stu-
dent imagination - I'd say that there's a
lot of different kinds of writers out there
and. a lot of different approaches to the
work," Wagner said.
"It's one of my goals to expose (stu-
dents) to as (many productions) as pos-
sible."

had to say about it was so great because
you get the real insight," Monka said.
. "It's interesting to know what you're
really being apart of Especially because
('See Rock City') is not a completed work.
It's cool to know that (the writers) are
going to come here and watch us perform,
and if we do something that theyilike, they
might just keep it."
"See Rock City and Other Destina-
tions" is a contemporary musical about
contemporary people, places and expe-
riences. The broad-ranging score and
series of relatable circumstances and
characters should leave audiences
touched. And, with the production's
characters and musical numbers, the
show just might be on its way to becom-
ing established in the Broadwayworld.

PLAYING AS THE WOLVERINES
The NCAA prevents video games from copying the exact like-
nesses of college players, so Player #34 on Michigan doesn't per-
fectly resemble Michigan senior forward DeShawn Sims. But the
game does precisely mimic the playing style of the team, specifi-
cally Coach John Beilein's signature motion offense.
"You're going to see a lot of movement, back cuts, things along
those lines that are specific to Michigan's offense," explains Con-
nor Dougan, lead producer of "NCAA Basketball 10."
The game also incorporates team-specific defenses, so Michigan

frequently uses its 1-3-1zone defense.
To create an authentic playing experience, Dougan and his team
have recreated various home courts, including Crisler Arena. But
Michigan's home base isn't part of the game's "Toughest Places to
Play" feature, which gives teams with a wild fan base a true home
court advantage. Still, Michigan starjunior forward Manny Harris
is psyched about "NCAA."
"That's something I always wanted to do - just be on a video
game," Harris said.
"I don't care who picks who. I'm going to play with Michigan."

Tonight, University students perform with phones for intsruments

By BRAD SANDERS
For the Dauily

phone away?"
This is some- .

phones are no
longer taboo. Today at 8 p.m.

communication Fret
devices didn't
have enough uses already, these
super-phones also double as musi-
cal instruments. Users can create
melodies using various Phone appli-
cations like the mini-piano and the
ocarina. Sound is either created by
blowing air into the phone's micro-
phone or by touching piano "keys"
on the screen. Speakers worn on the

students' wrists amplify the beats
and rhythms produced by the iPods.
This fresh and modern musical
concept has been used to create a
new inter-disciplinary class at the
University. One of the results of this
"Building a Mobile Phone Ensemble"
course was the Michigan Mobile
Phone Ensemble (or the MoPhos, as
the group is affectionately called),
which will be having an end-of-
semester performance tonight at 8
p.m. in the Britton Recital Hall in the
E.V. Moore Building.
Students majoring in a diverse
array of subjects like electrical
engineering and computer science,
as well as students in the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, are
involved in the ensemble.
"I've been working on turning
mobile phones into musical instru-
ments since 2005," wrote Georg Essl,
assistantprofessor and co-founder of
MoPho, in an e-mail interview.
"In 2007, the topic had matured

Steele said.
"Another student and I wrote a
piece for around 12 iPhones that is
meant to be played on a completely
dark stage," Kerr explained.
"Every phone plays a different
role in the piece, playing different
loops together, creating different
visual color patterns that tightly cor-
respond to the sounds being played."
Having worked on Kerr's and
their own compositions throughout
the semester, the students are excit-

ed about their new medium.
"Professor Essl really deserves
kudos for taking the initiative with
this class. As time goes on and he
develops the class more and more,
expect future performances to get
better and better," Music, Theatre &
Dance senior Owen Campbell wrote.
The MoPho way of producing
music is an innovative step for
creativity on campus, and who
knows, it may even revolutionize
the music industry.

GRE
From PageIA
"Students who are in school now,
who are looking at a very weak job
market and who have the means. to
go to graduate school are deciding
that they'll forgo trying to get a job
immediately after school," McNutt
said. "(They) basically decide to
stay in school so that when they do
come into the job market they're
entering with an advanced degree."
Engineering senior Michael
Glotter echoed McNutt's senti-
ment. Glotter said he was consider-
ing entering the work force before
going to graduate school, but the
economic climate caused him to
change his mind.
"If I'm going to go to grad school,
this kind of seems like it's a good
time to do it because jobs are so
limited right now," he said. "Grad
school is one of my only options
right now just because there aren't
many jobs available."
McNutt also attributed the rise in
testtakersto ETS'seffortstoreachout
to juniors and seniors. He said ETS
has revamped its website, increased
its presence on college campuses and
begun to offer free test prep materi-
als in order to increase the number of
people taking the test.
McNutt added that statistically,
individuals between the ages of
19 and 23, who are still in college,
do better than those who take the

test after they graduate. Graduate
schools accept GRE scores up to
five years after the test is taken, so
even if students aren't sure gradu-
ate school is right for them, McNutt
said, it's in their best interests to
take the test.
"It makes sense because those
students are still in school or are
closer to their academic experi-
ence, which really is helpful when
they are taking a high-stakes test
like the GRE," he said.
Another factor causing more stu-
dents to take the GRE is that many
MBA programs are now accepting
the GRE - in addition to the Gradu-
ate Management Admission Test -
as an admissions exam, according
to the ETS website.
Hundreds of MBA programs
around the world, including those
at Harvard Business School, Yale
School of Management and the
Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania, have all
started to accept the GRE as a sub-
stitute for the GMAT this year.
The Ross School of Business cur-
rently doesn't accept the GRE, but
Admissions Director Soojin Koh
wrote in an e-mail interview that
the school is considering adding the
test next year.
Last week, ETS announced
sweeping changes to the GRE. The
changes, which will go into effect in
2011, are partially aimed at making
the test have a greater resemblance
to the GMAT.


Site pairs students, Mich. employers

From Page 1A
just as students leave Michigan
because they assume there aren't.
jobs in state, employers likewise
assume there is no talent in Michi-
gan and look elsewhere.
"'So there are jobs. There is tal-
ent," she said. "They're not con-
necting."
Ken Darga, who is a demog-
rapher for the state of Michigan,
said the state has seen a net loss of
college graduates every year since
2005 because of the state's reces-
sion.
"If it continues for a long period
of time," Darga said, "that would
certainly reduce a state's potential
for future growth."
Compounding the exodus of col-
lege graduates is the sentiment that
there are no jobs for students who
do wantto stay. For one, LSA junior
Todd Phillips said he wants to stay
in Michigan after he graduates.
"I wouldn't say there's nothing

forward," Mahanti said. "It was a
really good collaborative effort."
LSA Rep. John Lin, who co-
authored the- resolution with
Mahanti, said it's necessary to
change MSA's Compiled Code so
that years down the road, future
MSA members will understand
the necessity of having a student-
wide election for DPS Oversight
Committee members.
"We realized that if you don't put

here, but the opportunities are
much smaller now," he said.
Robert Nana graduate student
in the School of Information, is
currently searching for a job in IT.
He said he would stay in the sate if
he can find ajob.
"I'm not against staying here
and finding a job here," Nan said,
"but ... most of the job opportuni-
ties come from California."
The goal of the site is to keep
students like Nan and Phillips in
the state by offering an advanced
matching system that will help
.both students and employers find
what they need.
Student profiles highlight spe-
cial skills like problem solving and
public speaking skills, as well as
personal characteristics, like hav-
ing a "goal-oriented" personality.
Prospective interns can also list
their time availabilities, preferred
schedules and desired job loca-
tions within the state of Michigan.
Students can also select their pre-
it in the Compiled Code," Lin said,
"there's a strong chance that years
from now somebody's going to for-
get that it's actually something we
have to have an election for."
If this resolution passes, elec-
tions to seat student represen-
tatives to the DPS Oversight
Committee would take place in
the campus-wide elections in
March and November. After the
initial election in March 2010,
elections would be staggered,
with each student serving a full
year term.
Because the March election

pany size.
The employer profiles address
the types of candidates companies
are looking for and the specifics of
job openings.
A logarithmic matching func-
tion then pairs up student and
employer profiles usingcertain key
words, like the student's area of
study or the industry the company
is in.
Handel said that in the future
the matching system will be more
advancedandwillavoidusingstock
phrases, like "hard-working."
The website also offers a number
of educational videos for its users.
For students, videos include inter-
view and business etiquette tips,
while videos for employers include
advice on how to decide whether
or not to offer interns permanent
positions.
The site has promotional videos
for cities around Michigan, includ-
ing Ann Arbor, that highlight the

that election would serve on the
committee a full-year term and
the runner-up would serve a half-.
year term to ensure both seats

This resolution will come up
for a vote on Jan. 12, the first MSA
meeting next semester.
The DPS Oversight Committee

Though Affolter-Caine said
Intern In Michigan has been suc-
cessful in its first eight months, the
website has run into issues align-
ing the timing of when students
express interest in finding jobs and
when companies offer job open-
ings. She said the issue is a result of
the misalignment of the academic
and fiscal calendars, but said she
thinks the issue will smooth itself
out over time.
Kerin Borland, the senior asso-
ciate director of the Career Center
at the University, said staff from
the Career Center and staff from
15 other public institutions in
Michigan consulted with Intern In
Michigan in its initial stages and
plan to stay involved as the pro-
gram evolves.

ing grievances against DPS.
According Mahanti, campus-
wide elections of students to
serve on the DPS committee have
not happened in recent years.
According to a Nov. 29 article
in The Michigan Daily, the last
campus-wide election is believed
to have been held in 1999. Since
then, MSA has appointed already-
elected MSA representatives to
serve on the committee through
an internal nomination process.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

After missing chances, freshman
still waiting to score first goal in A2

Graham shares Silver Football

Last night, Brandon Graham
won a piece of the Chicago Tri-
bune's Silver Football Award,
given to the BigTenMVP. After
the votes were tallied, Graham,
a senior defensive end on the
Michigan football team, was tied
with Penn State senior quarter-
back Daryll Clark.

The award, given out at the
end of every season for the last
85 years, had never had co-win-
ners until this year.
Graham was the lone bright
spot on the Wolverine defense,
leading the nation with 26 tack-
les for loss and tacking on 10.5
sacks.

Lynch has just one
assist in first 16
collegiate games
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
Kevin Lynch still can't get the
ringing noise out of his head.
On Friday night against Ohio
State, thefreshmanforwardpicked
up the puck at the top of the left
circle and letgo of a wrist shot that
beat the goalie - and clanged off
the left post. Against Minnesota
two weeks earlier,just five minutes
into the game, he beat a defense-
man but made the right post sing.
Whether he's hitting the post,
getting robbed by the goalie or
over-skating the puck on what
would have been a sure breakaway
on an empty net - like he did with

a minute left on Saturday night -
Lynch just can't find that elusive
first career goal.
"I'm getting chances, so I'm not
really worried about it," Lynch
said. "I just need to bear down
and once I get that first one, it will
come in bunches."
Lynch's struggles represent a
departure from his two previous
seasons with the U.S. National
Team Development Program
Under-18 team, where he averaged
a goal every three games and a
point every one-and-a-half games.
His performance enticed the.
Columbus Blue Jackets to pick him
in the second round of the 2009
NHL Draft.
Along with A.J. Treais and first-
year sensation Chris Brown, Lynch
was expected to contribute right
away up front. But 16 games into
this season, Lynch has recorded just
one point, an assist in a 5-1 blowout

of Lake Superior State in late Octo-
ber. While the lack of production
is surprising, Michigan coach Red
Berenson isn't concerned.
"I think he's doing well, but it's
hard for a player to think that,"
Berenson said. "You wouldn't want
to measure him with his goals or his
points. He's working hard, he's play-
ing physical, he's responsible defen-
sively. He's been good with the puck
and he's created some good scoring
chances for himself and his line-
mates and that's all he can do."
As the Wolverines approach
the halfway point of the season,
in order to pull themselves out of
10th place in the conference, they
will need more secondary scoring
to complement the line consisting
of Brown and juniors Carl Hagelin
and Matt Rust. But they can't sac-
rifice their defensive play in order
to score.
If Lynch can lose his affinity

for hitting two-inch posts, he may
be the one who can find a balance
between offense and defense.
With Berenson giving Lynch an
opportunity on the power play this
weekend, he could jumpstart the
offensive power that he showed in
his prep days.
As far as the slow start is con-
cerned, it shouldn't affect him too
much. It has happened before.
"I just come out in practice
and work hard and I know that
last year, I had a successful year,"
Lynch said. "I've started off slow
pretty much every year, so I'm not
really worried about it too much at
this point."
If he adjusts his sights to find the
back of the net at Yost Ice Arena on
Friday, during the first game of the
Michigan-Notre Dame home-and-
home series, the only sound in his
head will be the roar of the crowd's
appreciation after the goal.

How do you strike fear in the
hearts of Michigan men's basket-
ball fans?
Show them Utah's starting five.
Marshall Henderson, 6-foot-
2. Carlon Brown, 6-foot-5. Luka
Drea, 6-foot-5. Kim Tillie, 6-foot-
11. David Foster, 7-foot-3.
The average height of Michi-
gan's starting five, on the other
hand, is about 6-foot-5. At 6-foot-8,
senior DeshawnoSims is Michigan's
tallest starter.
The Wolverines haven't had a
legitimate seven-footer since Josh
Moore, a 7-foot-2 center who was
dismissed from the team in 2002,
and that's stretching the defini-
tion of "legiti-
mate."Sizehas Michigan
been an issue at Utah
since Michi-
gan coach Matchup:
John Beilein Michigan 4-3;
arrived, but Utah 4-4
it's in games When: 9 P.M.
against teams Where:
like Utah that Huntsmen Center
the difference
will be very ,ymichdailysports
apparent.
"They're huge," Beilein
said. "Skilled players,they got some
guys back from a team that was
very good last year. We will not see
size like this the entire year."
And the Wolverines are lucky
for that. Utah's size in the paint
only accentuates Michigan's need
to find a little luck from the 3-point
line. The Wolverines haven't shot
above 30 percent from beyond the
arc since they played Creighton
in the first game of the Old Spice
Classic on Nov.26.
Vexingly, two of the team's best
pure shooters have struggled the
most - sophomores Stu Douglass
and Zack Novak. The two have
shot a combined 21 percent from
the 3-point line in the last four
games.
Redshirt sophomore Laval
Lucas-Perry has been the team's
only consistent long-range threat,
shooting 40 percent forthe season.
"I've never really experienced
something like this before," Doug-
'lass said. "It's a little nce, but I

guess we'll see (tonight)."
Fortunately for the Wolverines,
Beilein has experienced this before
- and survived.
In the 2005 season while coach-
ing at West Virginia, his team hit
a slump after getting blown out
in a game against Villanova. The
Mountaineers went ice-cold and
limped into the NCAA Tourna-
ment, but recovered and advanced
to the Elite Eight.
"You go through (shooting
slumps), and you try to just get
through them," Beilein said. "But
you're not very pretty when you
don't have those things going."
At least one player's 3-pointer
seems to be improving. Junior
Manny Harris, who has shot 21
percent from the 3-point line thus
far, began to bolster his dismal
season from behind the arc in the
Wolverines' last game, when he
shot 3-of-4.
If Michigan's shooters can find
their rhythm early against the
Utes, it would take some of the
pressure off of Sims, who will
be walking in the land of giants
down low.
Against such height, Sims could
have a hard time establishing
himself as a threat in the post. But
Beilein said that tonight, Sims'
versatility could be an advantage.
"It depends on what they give
us," Beilein said. "DeShawn has
been able to score on big guys
at times ... whether he's scoring
inside or from 15 feet or at the
three, it's good that he's versa-
tile."
I The recent shooting woes have
also prompted players to work on
other weaknesses in their game.
Douglass, for his part, has been
working on his assist-to-turnover
ratio.
"I'm definitely trying to make
up in other aspects," Douglass
said. "I've been trying to distrib-
ute the ball more and not turn it
over as much."
Douglass has 17 assists this year
compared to just three turnovers,
marking an improvement from
last year. And if he, and the rest of
the team, can manage to get their
3-point shooting numbers up, they
may be able to sneak out of Utah
with a win.

THE CONSERVATIVE pleasantly
surprised
to find once
again that liberals are much more prone
to employing comedic relief when present-
ing the news. The most notable political
coverage was again opposition to Obama's
approach to Afghanistan. Even NPR liber-
als realizeyou cannotsetadeadline for end-
ing a war and hope to succeed. The funniest
segments were about Tiger Woods as well
as Sarah Palin's book "Going Rogue": "Mrs.
Palin quotes a number of writers and think-
ers in her book, among them Plato, whom
she identifies as a colorful type of clay."
Liberal Times columnist Frank Rich, in a
piece on the surge in Afghanistan, seemed
SUNDAY, DEC. 6 - For the last day of
the experiment, I watched "Meet the
Press" and "Fox News Sunday" to ease
myself back into friendly media territory.
Gen. David Petreaus appeared on FNS to
give his assessment on the new Afghani-
stan policy. Senators Dick Durbin (D - IL)
and John Cornyn (R - TX) exchanged a
few heated words over health care - how
much it would cost, the viability of the
public option and how many businesses
were not hiring because of potential tax
increases.
"Meet the Press" started off well, fea-
turing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

to have analyzed Obama's speech correctly.
It appeared absolutely nobody was happy
with the plan in Afghanistan. Rich also did
not buy Obama's attempt to deny the com-
parison between Afghanistan and Vietnam.
Overall, though, one thing is universal
about news both on the left and the right -
very few people have anything worthwhile
to say on Saturday. Meanwhile, MSNBC
doesn't run any news coverage at all on
Saturdays.
1.Cimategate
2.The cost of health care reform
3. Trial of 9/I1 "mastermind"
and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, but
another full hour on Afghanistan grew
dull, especially since there were no true
partisan hacks to make absurd state-
ments.
The most notable thing about this
experiment wasn't the slant. I was pre-
pared for the different viewpoints - it
was the disregard for certain issues such
as Climategate and financial news that
surprised rte.
As for the liberal approach to the few
economic issues the media did cover, it
seems as if the analysis fell short of the
economic reality.

GRAFFITI
From page 5B
was hard to make them out. But
around one of the occurrences of
the n-word, which someone tried
to scratch out unsuccessfully, there
seemed to be a racially charged
exchange with attacks against black
people, white people and Asians
that may have been spurred by an
initial comment.
Along with homosexual com-
ments, the article "Anonymous
Expression: A Structural View of
Graffiti" studied the prevalence of
racist graffiti in the restrooms of a
liberal university. The study, con-
ducted in 1976, found that 17 percent
of restroom graffiti was racist at all
universities surveyed, including the
liberal campus.
The study hypothesized that as
time passed and the tolerance of
black students on campus became
less of an issue, racist graffiti would
decrease. Thirty years later, the
Mason Hall men's room suggests
that campus still has bigots who are
inclined to express their hate anon-
ymously, but not as many as perhaps
once before.
A more common theme in the
men's restroom is sexism, which
appears not only in the predict-
able instances of objectification but
also in messages expressing sheer

misogyny and the desire to be vio-
lent against women.
Set up as a mathematic equation,
one graffitist sought to prove that
women equal evil, to which anoth-
er responded that women equal
pussy,and hence, equal good. The
final word goes to another graffic-
ist, though, who wrote: "Pussy has
destroyed lives, killed men (and)
brought nations down. Hell, I know
at least (three) evil pussies."
Following the format of other
survey questions in the restroom,
one graffitist asked for the "best
date rape drugs and where to get
them" - there is only one answer,
"Money (Parents)." Another wants
other men to continue a story he
started, which involves cutting a
woman's throat out after violent
"You finish the rest of the story,"
the creep invited.
Fortunately, nobody took him up
on it.
A COMMON DENOMINATOR
Of course, not all men are misog-
ynists, just as not all male graffiti is
crude, sexual and aggressive. Like-
wise, not all women feel the need
to spill their hearts on a bathroom
wall - and the ones who do aren't
necessarily gushing feelings and
heartfelt advice all the time.

THE COMCAST EMPIRE
Comcast, whose commercials and customer service have made it the cable com-
pany everyone loves to hate, announced that it would acquire a majority stake in
NBC Universal in a $30 billion deal. The deal, which has become the latest example
of massive media consolidation, has raised the hackles of consumer protection
groups who fear the cable giant could use its newfound power to force industry-
wide price increases, among other nefarious designs. Also worried is struggling
talk-show host Jay Leno, who risks being replaced by one of those Slowsky turtles.
"THE FAMILY" VALUES IN UGANDA
Gay Ugandans would face life imprisonment and, in some cases, the death penalty
under a bill being debated in the east African country. Ugandan legislators took
up the proposal following a conference in Kampala that featured three American
evangelical Christian activists. The bill's sponsor, David Bahati, has close ties to
the fundamentalist group "The Family," best known for offering counsel to GOP
adulterers like Sen. John Ensign and South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford. The bright
side: Maybe Ensign and Sanford will move to Uganda, where their marriages would
surely be stronger without all those gays running around and forming committed
relationships in the open.
HUFF PO BLOWS ONE
The Huffington Post got itself into a sticky situation Monday when it ran a story on
a poster warning against shower masturbation that was found in a University dorm
bathroom. The sign called self-pleasuring in the showers a "University of Michigan
Honor Code Violation," citing the costs of clearing semen from pipes that aren't
meant to handle it. The only problem: The poster is a hoax, one that has popped up
occasionally in dorm bathrooms here for years. The Huffington Post corrected their
story yesterday, but the embarassment of running a masturbation false alarm will
take a long time to clear from their content pipeline.

THURSDAY, DEC. 3 - You don't really
think about your news-consumption rou-
tine until you're forced to change it. Nor-
mally, I would walk to class listening to the
five minute NPR news podcast. instead,
I listened to Bill O'Reilly's brief "Talking
Points" podcast, in which he gives his take
on a particular news item. Thursday's topic
was the President's jobs summit. O'Reilly
called for a complete government spend-
ing freeze - advice apparently reserved for
Democratic presidents.
To be honest, I had wanted to listen to
the true king of conservative talk radio,
Rush Limbaugh, but conservative pundits
are apparently operating on a different
business model than their liberal counter-
parts (big surprise). I get full TV episodes of
"Countdown", "The Rachel Maddow Show"
and the NPR audio podcasts for free every
day. Limbaugh, on the other hand, charges
a minimum of $6.95 a month (or $57.90 for
FRIDAY, DEC. 4t-sI clicked around the
Drudge Report this morning beforeI
got out of bed, and discovered that Gate-
Crasher-Gate wasn't discovered by the
Secret Service until the next day via Face-
book. What?!
Besides that stunning revelation, I read
more about Climategate, which apparently
wouldn't have been more than a blip on
my radar if I had been perusing my nor-
mal sources. According to Drudge Report,
Friday was the 14th straight day that ABC,
NBC and CBS all neglected to report the
"huge Climategate story" during their
weekday news programs. After every-
thing I've had to read about Climategate,
it actually leaves me shocked that none of
the major news networks have covered it.
Does this mean I've been persuaded by Fox
and Drudge, or have I been manipulated
into thinking this is a real story when my
regular news sources apparently deemed it
SATURDAY, DEC. 5 - In the WSJ edi-
torial, "No Way, No How, to the Public
Option," Kimberley Strassel portrayed
Sen. Joe Lieberman (Conn.) as the last
defense standing between our country and

the year) for access to something called the
Rush 24/7 Club, which includes his podcast.
No wonder Republicans have lost touch
with nation's youth. I can listen to a pletho-
ra of "liberal" sources for no cost. How can
Republicans expect to effectively dissemi-
nate their message if they start by restrict-
ing access to it?
Later, while cringing through an hour
of "Glen Beck," I learned about a scandal
involving a number of scientists that is being
referred to as "Climategate." Between this
and "Gate-Crasher-Gate" - concerning the
White House party crashers - I've decided
Watergate was the worst thing to happen to
the media in the history of suffixes.

insignificant?
Coming home from class, I gazed long-
ingly at that lovely blue bag containing
the New York Times on my porch before
settling down with a borrowed copy of
the Wall Street Journal. WSJ economics
reporter Jon Hilsenrath debated the role
of the central bank in the United States. I
had always assumed that the salient debate
was over the role of government concern-
ing oversight or bailouts, but never in its
fundamental right to act in the market-
sphere at all. But for the second time in as
many days, I encountered someone argu-
ing against allowing the Fed to set interest
rates or regulate banks.

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN if a liberal and a conservative
traded news media for a few days? Liberal Sam Wainwright
and Libertarian Sam van Kleef did just that, ignoring news
for half a week and then submerging themselves in enemy S
content for the other half. The result? Insight into the bias of
U.S. news outlets.
BY SAM WAINWRIGHT AND SAM VAN KLEEF

THURSDAY, DEC. 3 - Ignoring the book-
marked Drudge Report tab on my browser,
I was instead confronted with three mas-
sive pictures of Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke on the Huffington Post web-
site that accompanied astory onBernanke's
reconfirmation hearing. I read through
some of the headlines and watched a clip
of Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show" on the
Climategate situation, which garnered
mainly angry rebuttals in the comment sec-
tion. A New York Times editorial on Presi-
dent Obama's job summit contained absurd
claims that flew in the face of anyone who
has taken even the most basic economics
class - for example, the idea that unem-
ploymentbenefits help create jobs.
"Countdown" with Keith Olbermann
was the linchpin of liberal propaganda for
the day. Olbermann's most annoying part
was his very childish impersonations in his
"World's Worst Persons" segment.
Finally, I got in a good laugh when Olber-
mann accused the morning newscast "Fox
& Friends" for taking the Climategate
FRIDAY,DEC.4- FirstcthingFridaymorn-
ing, I turned to Huffington Post and the
Times editorial page. Interestingly, both left
and right seemed to agree on the poor han-
dling of the biggest current news issue, war
in Afghanistan. But Gail Collins of the Times
was apparently worried to death about a few
hundred million dollars in cuts in a $1.2 tril-
lion healthcare bill. She did, however, make
the astute remark that Republicans are only
fiscal conservatives when not in power.
On "Countdown," Adrianna Huffing-
ton's acknowledgement that hard times are
ahead for the Democrats in 2010 didn't go
down well with Olbermann, who tried to
steer the conversation toward discussing
the right-wing fringe. Childish tea-bagger
references are still thrown around. Liberal
hypocrisy on "Countdown" abounded as
usual, with the "birthers" rightfully blasted
SATURDAY, DEC.5 - On the morning of
day three, I felt some slight withdrawal, as
I again had to ignore my bookmarked tabs
and go straight to the Huffington Post and

"Daily Show" clip out of context. He should
have called the Huffington Post first, since
the full Daily Show segment was on the site
and showed that Fox & Friends were cor-
rect in saying Stewart had blasted Al Gore
and the climate scientists.
So far, three differences have already
become apparent between conservative and
liberal media. First, all the headlines are
much larger in liberal websites - the big-
gest font size on right-wing websites is 28,
but the left seems obsessed with headlin-
ing its propaganda in size 36 or above. The
second difference lies in the liberal media's
tendency to employ humor in delivering the
news. That probably helps compensate for
the third difference, which is the intensity
of the anger and hatred expressed in reader
comments.
1. Obana's unemnploymentsummit
2The Bernanke hearing
3. Climategate on "The Daily Show"
even though the show never made an issue
of crazy liberals like the "9/11truthers." One
of the main differences I realized Friday
between the left- and right-wing news and
opinion programs was in the types of people
interviewed. It seems the majority of guests
on right-wing programs are much more sig-
nificant individuals, like senators, others in
Congress, PAC heads or CEOs. On the other
hand, the left mostly features people whose
credibility seems only tobe founded on their
opinions (writers, columnists, etc.) as well as
a small pool of (former) political Democrats.

2. Healthcare

Michigan life,
accordingto MBlog
What the University's
blogging site tells about
campus life
Back when the University hired
student bloggers to attract pro-
spective students, entries were
limited to overly enthusiastic
testimonials from model Wolver-
ines. But the University's MBlog,
a blogging service for current stu-
dents and University faculty and
staff, offers another, more telling
side of the University experience.
With no guidelines dictating who
can write or what they can write
about, the website www.mblog.
lib.umich.edu is a smorgasbord of
everything from wacky campus
anecdotes to constructive lessons
on communication skills.
Some students use MBlog to
reflect on class subjects in entries
that are too personal for CTtools
responses but too academic for per-
sonaljournaling. One student in the
School of Art and Design uses her
blog, eye pea, as an online work-
shop to plan and chronicle her art
projects - such as the construction
of nine 7-to-12-foot moth costumes.
But the blogger also portrays cam-
pus through the eyes of an artist,
writing about the time she and a
stranger drew on the sidewalk with
chalk and the time she played Bob
Dylan on her ukulele with a street
musician on State Street. "I think
the minute I saw him playing I
understood realized (sic) that I was
not trying to get somewhere," she
wrote. "I was not racing the clock,
I didn't have a goal or desire other
than to be where I was at that exact
place and time."
other students use MBlog more
as a personal journal instead of

TALKING
POINTS

- MOHAMMAD SOHAIL, owner of a con-
venience store in Long Island, describing an
episode a few months ago when a man entered
his store with a baseball bat and demanded
money. Sohail pulled out a rifle, which prompt-
ed the man to start crying and say, "I'm sorry, I
have no food. I have no money. My whole
family is hungry...don't shoot me."

using a paper diary or a better-
known blog host. On a host site as
obscure as MBlog, one must won-
der how public the bloggers really
intend their writing to be. Take the
blogger behind "My Little Space
on the Web," who writes about
working as a secret shopper and
discovering her grandfather has
had a hair replacement operation,
but hardly receives a comment to
confirm any sort of readership.
The blog does express the
unpredictable nature of student
life at the University - even if
this blogger's life is stranger than
most. Recounting a free palm-
reading session, the blogger said
the psychic told her she needed
to see a doctor. Spurred by her
friend's superstition, the blogger
followed the psychic's advice and
found out she was experiencing an
ectopic pregnancy that could have
killed her.
If you're a fantasy sports fanatic
and spend all your time checking
up on the latest statistics, there is
an MBlog for you, too. Or, if you
like to deck out your dog in the
latest fashions for strolls around
Ann Arbor, an MBlog about stylish
dog carriers can tell you what's in
for your pet. For budding foodies,
there is an MBlog with recipes for
dishes like oriental coleslaw and
stir-fry. And if you're into insects,
there's also a blogger who posts
close and personal pictures of
creepy crawlers.
MBlog hosts many single-
entry blogs, too. Perhaps these
authors have a burning desire to
express just one particular pro-
found thought that's been itching
at their psyches for quite some
time. or maybe they tried out the
whole blog thing casually and for-
got to do it again - who knows?
But some of these one-hit won-
ders definitely add entertainment

value to MBlog. The
"Golden Fisticuffs"
blog, for instance,
contains as its sole .
entry an explana-
tion of the blog's
name. The blog-
ger reasons: "Why
Golden Fisticuffs?
'Fisticuffs' is my
favorite word. Gold-
en sounded OK with
it. That's about it."
Another single-post
blog that resonates
with poeticism con-
tains a single word:
"bleh." That one lit-
tle word does seem '1 -- cC
to say a lot.
Some blogs are
more informative
than others. For
instance, MBlog
hosts blogs focused
on drug importationp
laws, internship
opportunities, event
listings for students
interested in sta-
tistics, articles on
ways to quit smok-
ing and financial aid
advising. Schools at the University lib
like the Nursing School, the School stt
of Social Work and the School of Of
Information, as well as student sio
groups like MichigandEngineer- fin
ing Enotrepreneurs and Alterna-
tive Spring Break, use MBlog as ,tra
a resource to spread news and an
knowledge. You can even watch th,
podcasts from University alums wI
on the "True Blue Podsquad" blog. ge:
Certain classes require stu- In
dents to use MBlog as part of their up
assignments. On one such blog, a he
freshman blogger complains and fin
rants about her homework while les
she blogs as a requirement for that en
same class. Oh, the freedom of MI

YOUTU BE
VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
Voicemail with soul
By this point, the Tiger Woods
scandal has become banal and stu-
pid. The sad reality, though, is
that gossip-lovers will keep talk-
ing about it. Given this unfortunate
situation, you might as well look for
the more clever commentary on the
scandal.
This video is a good example of
an artful take on Woods's "trans-
gressions." Called "Tiger Woods
Voicemail Slow Jam Remix," the
video features a montage of pho-
tos and an R&B song set against
Woods's notorious voicemail mes-
sage, in which he asks one of his
mistresses, Jaimie Grubbs, no
change her voicemail message to
an automated greeting, just in case
his wife calls and hears her voice
on the message.
The video beginswith a picture
of the backdrop of a city at night.
Then Woods's face appears on the
screen, and the slow jam starts,
with the voicemail playing softly
in the background. "Hey, it's, uh,
it's Tiger," Woods says in a breathy
tone, while a chorus of voices
chimes in with "Name off your
phone...off your phone, she may be
calling you." Some of the chorus
members perform beautiful solos,
which makes Woods's plea seem
oddly sentimental, as if he doesn't
bear responsiblity for his own adul-
terous actions.
That may be the most amusing
part of the video.

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
"But is it art?" fair - Actor James Franco is in the
midst of a two-month stint on "General Hospital."
Why? Because when a movie star acts in a cheesy
soap it's art, at least according to Franco's editorial
in the Wall Street Journal. If you throw a gallery
event to exhibit your everyday activity, you can
claim it is performance art, too. Then you and your
friends can stand around asking each other the last
line of Franco's editorial: "But is it art?"
Throwing this porty? Let us know. TheStatement@umich.edu
STUDY OF THE WEEK
Loneliness can be infectious in social networks
Loneliness can be contagious and disseminate through social net-
works, according to a study published in the journal Personal and
Social Psychology by a group of professors. The researchers defined
loneliness as perceived social isolation, and they said it is not deter-
mined by how many people are around you.
For the study, the researchers used information from the Framing-
ton Heart Study, analyzing the data on the 5,124 people who are in the
second generation of study participants. The researchers made contact
with the group of people every two to four years, and asked them ques-
tions about loneliness, depression and other matters.
The researchers discovered that if a direct connection in your social
network is experiencing loneliness, you are 52 percent more likely to
have similar feelings of loneliness. Moreover, if you are either two or
three degrees removed from a lonely person, you are 25 percent or 15
percent, respectively, more likely toexperience loneliness.

Why there's a drastic difference
in graffiti between the men and
women's Fishbowl restrooms
By Jessica Vosgerchian I Magazine Editor
Women's restroom photos by Marissa McLain
Men's restroom photos by Sam Wolson

scrawl in the women's restroom nearest the
Fishbowl reads, "Why do people write on
stalls?" In something like a nod to postmod-
ern self-awareness, the line appears in several stalls
in the same large black marker.
The ironic graffitist has a point - from the clut-
ter of graffiti present in different places around
campus, it's clear that defacing campus with pens
is a major pastime for University students. It would
take a thorough survey of students to determine all
the reasons why people put ink to wall, but salient
themes in the graffiti itself suggest some common
motives.
To shed some light on the University's tangle of
jotted thoughts, The Statement applied psychol-
ogy studies of bathroom graffiti to two of the most
used restrooms on campus, the men and women's
restrooms in Mason Hall near the Fishbowl. The
comparison between the two rooms shows that
the difference between men and women's restroom
habits definitely doesn't end at standing up and sit-
ting down.
From an informal survey of graffiti in each of
the restrooms, the inherent differences between
men and women are stark. The samples match the
characterization of men and women's graffiti in the
study "Writing in the Stall: Gender and Graffiti,"
by James A. Green from the University of Otago in
New Zealand.
In the survey of a pair of restrooms in a library
at the University of Otago, Green found that men
were more likely to write opinions, insults and rac-
ist comments, and keep to the topics of politics and
homosexuality. Women more often wrote about
relationships and sex, religion and philosophy, and
maintained a more positive, supportive tone with
attempts to cool down heated exchanges.
Other than the debate of politics - which Green
found to be a dominant topic in men's graffiti but
appears more often in the Mason Hall women's
restroom -the graffiti The Statement surveyed in
the last week follows many of the same patterns.
GOING TO THE RESTROOM ON
VENUS AND MARS
The Mason Hall women's room is home to the
"Go Blue Girly Confessions" stall, which The State-
ment first described in a 2007 story about the unof-
ficial peer counseling system that had emerged
through graffiti. While the stall's title has been
removed from the wall, the same brand of confes-
sions and heartfelt responses flourish.
Requests for life advice are so common in the
women's restroom that one woman felt comfort-
able describing her boyfriend's lousy handling of
their one year anniversary for an entire paragraph
before cutting it short to go to class with a promise
to continue later.

"He has been good to me in most other respects,"
she wrote. "To be continued... (have class)"
But one topic that doesn't always foster a sup-
portive discourse is religion, which has spurred a
couple lengthy debates involving fervent believers
and atheists, or alternatively, conservative Chris-
tians and gay-rights activists.
These debates usuallybegin after someone writes
either a message about salvation through Jesus
Christ or something akin to "There is no God." But
sometimes, contemporary social issues are thrown
into the mix, which spawn an even larger and more
tangled thread of responses.
The door of the "Go Blue Girly Confessions" stall
is, ironically, now playing host to a vehement argu-
ment over religious prohibition of gay marriage.
The result is sort of a "Who would Jesus let marry?"
debate.
"Jesus is all about love, man," reads one pro-gay
marriage message. "If he lets old and sterile people
into loving, sexual, but non-child producing rela-
tionships, I can't imagine he would have a problem
with gay marriage."
Then a counter-response draws from the Bible to
argue against gay marriage: "Does anyone remem-
ber what happened to Sodom (and) Gomorrah? It
was destroyed."
Asidefrom life advice and religious debate, many
of the stalls in the women's restroom feature open-
ended questions like, "If you could change one thing
about society, what would it be?"
Some of several responses were "trafficking in
women (and) children" and "unborn children see
the light of day."
A similar trend in the men's room is questions
with a numbered list beneath them inducing oth-
ers to fill in their answers. But unlike the women's
room social-minded idealism, the men's room ques-
tions tend to be narrower in scope - surveys about
favorite drugs, worst professors and most reviled
public figures (Glenn Beck, Kanye).,
But another prompt highlights the main differ-
ence between the men and women's room - titled
"Post Secret," the prompt's four answer slots are
empty, suggesting that men aren't as interested
in whispering their secrets to bathroom walls as
women are.
When men do confess - such as one did by writ-
ing, "I know my GF cheated with me and I'm still
with her" - they don't receive consolatory mes-
sages from anonymous hands.
"Yeah, my bad about that man," reads the sole
response.
The men's restroom is practically the exact
inverse of the women's restroom. Where the lat-
ter is preoccupied with questions of life, love and
the meaning of it all, the former features "find the
hidden number" games, hostile insults and loads of
sexual innuendos.

Male aggression is present even in a game turned
violent. One graffitist invited others to add a sen-
tence to a story he began with, "One day I woke
up and walked to class..." The story continues in a
different hand per line like so: "After doing three
packets of boy ... Then I killed a man. Just to see him
die. I took off his skin and made a suit. I sold the suit
to a homeless man. I THEN KILLED THE HOME-
LESS MAN."
But as Green found in his study, graffiti in the
men's restroom are less likely to be written in
response to previous notes. Instead ofvying to enter
a discourse with other people, men more often seek
only to let their opinion be known, whether it is
incendiary or something innocuous like "Toy Story
2 was OK..."
COMING OUT TO BATHROOM STALLS
Perhaps the most telling difference between the
men and women's Mason Hall restrooms is in the
treatment of homosexuality.
Besides the occasional flare-up over gay mar-
riage, lesbian sexuality is a common and matter-
of-fact topic on the walls of the women's restroom.
Women write about problems with coming out,
relationships with girlfriends and desire to have
sex with women.
"I have been dating a girl for (four) months (and)
I can't tell anyone," Wrote one woman. "They won't
love me the same. Depressed. Hate myself. HELP."
But in the men's restroom, where the overriding
rule is to make fun of everything, it is unclear what
comments are sincere and which are meant as anti-
gay jokes. But since homosexual comments make up
the majority of graffiti, it's safe to say some serious
social pressure must be behind the running "gag."
Gay-related comments come in several varieties,
running the gamut from usage of the words "gay"
and "faggot" as insults to seemingly earnest solici-
tations for sex, with code names and phone num-
bers to facilitate hookups.
Some threads appear to be graffitists attacking
others for homophobic comments. After someone
wrote "I'm not" with an arrow to a description of a
co-op as gay friendly, another man responded with
"silently wants penis bad!"
Most of the messages contain explicit descrip-
tions of sexual acts and requests for semen and big
penises, but it is impossible to tell the intention of
the writers. They could be openly gay men express-
ing their sexuality, straight men pretending to be
gay as a joke or closeted gay men expressing the
sexuality they long to claim in real life. Of course,
they might not be any of the above, defying labels in
their interest in male-male sexuality.
Take this question, "Anyone bi-curious?" and the
single response, "Yes." Then, there is a response
from a man who wants to try having sex with

another man before he marries his female fianc6.
But many studies of homosexual graffiti hold
that non-gay men are the main authors of gay graf-
fiti and their intent is to insult homosexuality. A
study in the Journal of American Folklore in 1972,
called "Social Analysis of Graffiti," asserted that
gay graffiti was the result of intolerance in a com-
munity, predicting that as homosexuality becomes
more accepted, gay graffiti would decrease.
Another article published in the same journal
in 1976, however, contested that claim, asserting
that gay graffiti is more prevalent in communities
where homosexuality is widely tolerated. The arti-
cle, titled "Anonymous Expression: A Structural
View of Graffiti," focused on a comparison between
restroom graffiti at a liberal university and that of
a control group of other universities, high schools
and other public spaces. The study found that 20
percent of graffiti at the liberal university was
homosexual, compared to just 3 percent at moder-
ate or conservative universities.
According to the study, the higher occurrence
of homosexual graffiti and a lower tolerance in the
community for anti-gay comments are correlated.
"(Statements) expressive of exactly those values
and sentiments whose public expression is denied
will be found on the toilet walls," the article said.
Whatever the case with the Mason Hall men's
restroom, it's clear that someone isn't able to
express their feelings on homosexuality (or homo-
sexual feelings) in public to the same degree that
the stall wall affords them.
ANONYMOUS MOB MENTALITY
Gender differences in graffiti style are clear, but
the reasons for that disparity are not as simple as
men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
Green concluded that graffiti in sex-divided areas
tends to be a manifestation of exaggerated gender
stereotypes.
One of the theories Green draws on to argue this
point is communication accommodation, which
is the process of adapting one's language style to
match that of a group. In spaces that are gender
homogenous, people conform to gender norms
more than they would in mixed society.
"In the single-sex context of the toilet, gendered
norms are likely to prevail, as the language styles of
those interacting are likely to be more similar than
different," Green wrote. "However, in the mixed-
gender context, adaptation is likely to occur."
But Green makes clear that conformity to gender
norms doesn't guarantee that the graffitists fit that
same mold in their real lives. He quotes another
study about social identity and de-individuation,
which asserts that people are more likely to be
influenced by group identity when "visual anonym-
ity will further reduce perceived intragroup dif-

ferences, thereby in increasing the salience of the
group." When nothing but gender is known of their
audience, women graffitists resort to girl talk and
men turn to locker room talk.
Green's research on graffiti in mixed-gender
spaces validates the communication adaptation,
since he found that library study booths he sampled
featured little of the hyper-stereotypical language
that characterized the restrooms - instead, graffiti
in the booths ran the middle of the road between
the two extremes.
Graffiti in the study cubicles in the stacks of
the Graduate Library coincide with Green's find-
ings in mixed-gender spaces. Gone are the lengthy
feminine pleas and the most explicit of male sexual
expression. More often, study cubicles were char-
acterized by neutral topics like complaints about
schoolwork and music taste.
Sometimes, particular themes take over indi-
vidual Grad Library cubicles, so that one heater
vent was dedicated to names and dates and another
wall featured homage to musicians like Pearl Jam
and Lupe Fiasco. When Green encountered this
phenomenon in his study, he theorized that graffiti
styles were "bred over time" through imitation.
Green applied this theory to single-gender spaces
as well, explaining that the stalls he studied often
featured a particular tone that dominated the dis-
course.
"An inflammatory graffito may then spawn fur-
ther inflammatory graffiti," he wrote. "Conversely,
a more polite interactive tone may lead to further
inscriptions in a similar style."
THE DARK SIDE OF UNSIGNED
THOUGHTS
Imitation might be part of the reason one stall in
the Mason Hall men's room features half a dozen
swastikas and at least two instances of the n-word,
but it doesn't explain why the first man to pen the
symbols of hate did so.
Several studies confirming gender differences in
graffiti have asserted that inflammatory statements
- such as gay bashing and racist slurs - are much
more frequent in men's restrooms than in wom-
en's. In fact, some surveys have found that racism
in women's restrooms is almost nonexistent. This
would be the case in the Mason Hall women's rest-
room, where the only racial comments occurred in
one stall. They were "I have yellow fever... and it's
fun," "Mexican clown car... Think about it" and "I
(heart) Mexicans."
Racial comments in the men's room weren't com-
mon, but when they did appear, they were incendi-
ary and outright racist. The stall with the swastikas
contained most of the racial comments, but as the
wall is covered with messages of all varieties, it
