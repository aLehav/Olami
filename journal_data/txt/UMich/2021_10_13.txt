The Michigan Daily spoke with 

University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel Oct. 8 to discuss his 
plans to step down as president in 
June 2023 as well as his exit package. 
Read part two of the interview to hear 
Schlissel’s thoughts on COVID-19 on 
campus one month into the semester, 
in addition to new sexual misconduct 
policies. 

This conversation has been edited 

for clarity.

The Michigan Daily: On Oct. 

5 you announced that you will be 
stepping down as president of the 
University in June of 2023, a year 

earlier than previously planned. 
Why did you decide to step down, 
and why did you announce it now? 

Mark Schlissel: I’m looking at 

the University gradually coming 
out of this pandemic that upended 
how we function and trying to 
define what the new normal is 
going to be. We’ve got people 
working remotely still, some people 
working on campus. We’ve learned 
how to deliver online education in 
ways that may alter the on-campus 
curriculum. It’s just a time of great 
change. We want to be sure that 
we’re planning forward-looking 
strategies to make sure that the 
excellence and the impact of our 
University 
is 
maintained 
and 

enhanced, even under the new 
world we’re going to be functioning 
in, and it seems like that’s operating 
with a time course of many, many 

years longer than my original time 
horizon. 

I told myself I’d do 10 years, and 

I’ve reconsidered. I plan on stopping 
after my ninth year. The reason 
to announce it as soon as I did is 
to give the Board of Regents and 
the community as much time as 
possible to talk to one another and 
to get a sense of what the highest 
needs are, what our ambitions are as 
a community, and just to get enough 
input and be deliberative on what 
you know is an important decision.

I’ll have been leading the 

University for approaching a decade 
— that’s a long period of time — and 
the regents really need the time 
and space to make a really careful, 
thoughtful approach to a search, 
look very widely for my successor, 
settle on a great person, and then 
we need time for a transition. I 

benefited greatly from having my 
appointment announced six months 
before I actually started. I was still 
provost at Brown, but I was able 
to come here to Ann Arbor at least 
once a month or once every three 
weeks or so and meet with people 
and climb the learning curve to help 
understand this big, complicated 
place. So, just to provide plenty of 
time for a thoughtful transition is 
the main thing.

TMD: The Detroit Free Press 

has characterized your stepping 
down early as a deal between 
yourself and members of the Board 
of Regents who were divided over 
your performance. Is this reporting 
accurate in your view, and what role 
did the board play in your decision 
to step down early?

The University of Michigan’s 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security 
released 
its 
2021 

Security and Fire Safety Report 
Oct. 4. The annual report, which 
is required by the Jeanne Clery 
Act, lists statistics for several 
types of crime on campus.

The 
most 
recent 
report 

covered the 2020 calendar year. 
Crimes are entered into DPSS’s 
Clery logs based on the date the 
crime was reported, regardless 
of when it occurred. Reports of 
crimes perpetrated by former 
University 
doctor 
Robert 

Anderson — which spanned 
the decades he spent at the 
University — were not reported 
until 2020, making the number 
of reports from this past year 
much higher than in years prior.

Of the 1,212 rapes reported 

in 2020, 1,194 were part of the 
Anderson investigation. There 
were 947 cases of fondling, 
of which 916 came from the 
investigations.

“It is important to note that 

the University also received 
reports about Anderson that 
included conduct that did not 
meet the definition of a Clery 
Act crime,” the report reads. 
“Because 
those 
allegations 

did not reflect crimes meeting 
Clery Act definitions, they are 
not included in the University’s 
statistics.”

As 
part 
of 
the 
report’s 

addendum, DPSS clarified how 
it classified Anderson cases, 
especially 
cases 
where 
the 

details are unclear due to the 
nature of the reports. In general, 
when there was a question 
of whether or not a case took 
place within the University’s 
Clery area — which refers to 
the University property and 
its 
immediate 
surroundings 

— DPSS said they erred on the 
side of including that case in the 
report. 

Survivors 
of 
Anderson 

protested at the most recent 
Board 
of 
Regents 
meeting, 

calling on the University to 
better protect victims of sexual 
misconduct. 
Hundreds 
of 

survivors had previously filed 
a class action lawsuit against 
the 
University, 
saying 
the 

University knew of misconduct 
but failed to take action on these 
claims. 

DPSS also said they leaned 

toward including all cases when 
an individual gave a vague 
number of instances. When 
individuals reported a range 
of occurrences, officials took 
the higher end of the estimate. 
DPSS also said they did their 
best to correlate descriptions of 
cases to a specific number. For 
example, a “couple” of incidents 
was counted as two and a “few” 
were counted as three.

Beyond the Anderson-related 

claims, the University saw a 
decrease in liquor and drug law 
violations during 2020, while 
other crimes remained largely 
stable. Four fires occurred in 
2020 — all were unintentional.

U-M President talks resignation announcement, multimillion dollar contract in Daily interview 

DOMINIC COLETTI

Daily Staff Reporter

Last December, the Michigan 

Nurses Association voted to ratify a 
one-year extension to their previous 
collective bargaining agreement with 
Michigan Medicine. The agreement, 
which included a stipulation that 
nurses are not required to be 
vaccinated against COVID-19, covers 
all 6,200 nurses in the University of 
Michigan Professional Nurse Council 
Independent Union and will expire in 
June 2022.

According to the new agreement, 

“subject 
to 
Federal 
and 
State 

requirements and guidelines for 
distribution priority, the Employer will 
provide the COVID-19 vaccination 
at no cost to the employees and on a 
voluntary basis.”

The 
University’s 
COVID-19 

vaccine mandate announced in July 
by University President Mark Schlissel 
does not apply to nurses at Michigan 
Medicine due to the terms in their 
collective bargaining agreement. The 
provisions of the agreement allow 
nurses to negotiate a vaccine mandate 
and though it encourages vaccination, 
it doesn’t require it. 

Michigan Medicine spokeswoman 

Mary Masson told The Michigan Daily 
that reporting individual vaccination 
status is not required as well. 

“Our staff members are required 

to be vaccinated, unless they have 
received an exemption or are covered 
by collective bargaining and have not 
reached an agreement on the vaccine 

mandate,” Masson wrote in an email. 
“We are currently asking our nurses 
to voluntarily report their vaccination 
status, but have not collected all of that 
data.”

Anne Jackson, a registered nurse 

at Michigan Medicine and interim 
president of the MNA, said she 
believes a vast majority of nurses at 
Michigan Medicine are vaccinated 
and encourages everyone who can to 
get vaccinated. Jackson added that 
there are other aspects of safety that 
Michigan Medicine staff should be 
focusing on and that vaccines are 
only one part of the fight against the 
pandemic. 

“We need to make sure that every 

nurse has access to proper PPE,” 
Jackson wrote. “We need to make 
sure that nurses are promptly notified 
by Michigan Medicine if we have 
been exposed to COVID-19. We need 
to make sure that nurses are able to 
easily and quickly get tested if we are 
exposed irrespective of vaccination 
status. We need to make sure that all 
nurses are able to take the time off 
they need if we get exposed or contract 
COVID-19.”

Many Michigan undergraduate 

nursing students said they feel as 
though getting the vaccine is an 
obligation that nurses should have 
to follow. Nursing junior Molly 
Reynolds explained that health care 
providers set the standard for others, 
so if patients see their caretakers 
not getting vaccinated, that might 
persuade them to decline the vaccine 
as well.

includes stipulation against a requirement

A professor has taken over the 

undergraduate class previously taught 
by Bright Sheng, Leonard Bernstein 
Distinguished University Professor 
of Composition, David Gier, dean of 
the School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
announced Oct. 1. The announcement 
comes almost a month after Sheng 
showed a video to an undergraduate 
composition seminar featuring an 
actor in blackface. 

Regarding the recent instructor 

change, Gier wrote that this switch 
would “allow for a positive learning 
environment” so students could focus 

on their “growth as composers.”

Sheng, a highly accomplished 

composer, conductor and pianist, has 
had his music featured by prestigious 
groups including the New York 
Philharmonic Orchestra, the Chinese 
National Symphony Orchestra and the 
New York City Ballet Orchestra.Sheng 
also received a commission in honor of 
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visiting 
the White House in 1999, as well as 
numerous awards and fellowships.

The Michigan Daily looked deeper 

into what happened. 

On Sept. 10, Music, Theatre & Dance 

freshman Olivia Cook attended her 
first composition seminar with Sheng. 
This semester, the course focused on 
analyzing Shakespeare’s works, and 

the class began with a screening of 
the 1965 version of “Othello.” Cook 
told The Daily she quickly realized 
something 
seemed 
strange, 
and 

upon further inspection, noticed the 
onscreen actor Laurence Olivier was in 
blackface. 

“I was stunned,” Cook said. “In 

such a school that preaches diversity 
and making sure that they understand 
the history of POC (people of color) in 
America, I was shocked that (Sheng) 
would show something like this in 
something that’s supposed to be a safe 
space.” 

The 1965 version of the film has 

been a topic of controversy since its 
initial release when The New York 
Times wrote a 1966 article criticizing 

Olivier’s use of blackface as well as his 
stereotypical performance. 

According 
to 
Cook, 
the 

students were given no warning or 
contextualization prior to the viewing. 

Sheng sent out an apology on Sept. 

10 shortly after the class ended, noting 
that the casting and portrayal “was 
racially insensitive and outdated.” A 
copy of this email has been obtained by 
The Daily. A planned “Othello” project 
was then canceled by Sheng.

In an email to The Daily, Evan 

Chambers, professor of composition, 
wrote about the importance of 
properly 
preparing 
students 
for 

possible instances of racism in film.

“To 
show 
the 
film 
now, 

especially 
without 
substantial 

framing, content advisory and a 
focus on its inherent racism is in 
itself a racist act, regardless of the 
professor’s intentions,” Chambers 
wrote. “We need to acknowledge 
that as a community.”

Five days after Sheng showed 

the video, on Sept. 15, Gier 
sent a department-wide email 

acknowledging the incident and 
apologizing for what students 
experienced. 

“Professor Sheng’s actions do not 

align with our School’s commitment 
to anti-racist action, diversity, equity 
and inclusion,” Gier said.

The email also stated the 

incident had been reported to the 
Office of Equity, Civil Rights, and 
Title IX.

Sheng’s apology causes 

controversy

On Sept. 16, Sheng sent out a 

formal apology to the department. 
He wrote that after doing more 
research into the issue, he realized 
the true extent to which racism 
impacts American culture, adding 
that he failed to recognize the racist 
connotation of blackface makeup.

“In a classroom, I am a teacher 

representing the university and I 
should have thought of this more 
diligently 
and 
fundamentally; 

I apologize that this action was 
offensive and has made you angry,” 
Sheng wrote. “It also has made me 
lost (sic) your trust.”

However, the apology has been 

another 
source 
of 
controversy 

among students. Students have taken 
particular issue with the section of 
the letter where Sheng lists multiple 
examples of how he has worked with 
people of color in the past. 

“At the world premiere of my 

opera The Silver River in South 
Carolina in 2000, I casted an 
African American actress (for 
the leading role), an Asian female 
dancer and a white baritone for 
the three main characters,” Sheng 
wrote.

University of Michigan President 

Mark Schlissel signed a contract 
with the Board of Regents on Sept. 23 
guaranteeing that he will be paid his 
same salary of $927,000 for two years 
after his resignation in June 2023, 
according to a copy of the contract 
obtained by The Michigan Daily.

Schlissel announced Oct. 5 that 

he will resign in June 2023, a year 
earlier than originally planned. The 
Board of Regents and Schlissel held a 
public meeting on Sept. 23 but made 
no mention of Schlissel’s planned 
resignation or the signing of a new 
contract.

“After discussion with the Board 

of Regents, I decided that this timing 
is appropriate,” Schlissel wrote in an 
email to the University community 
on Oxt. 5. “The new horizon gives 
the Board time to consult with our 

community, think about the future 
and thoroughly plan and conduct a 
search for my successor, while allow-
ing us to continue momentum on 
important and time-critical efforts 
that are underway.” 

After stepping down as president 

no later than July 1, 2023, Schlissel 
will become President Emeritus, a 
role in which he “will be engaging 
in a variety of activities in support of 
the University as well as continuing 
(his) ambassadorship of higher edu-
cation more generally,” according to 
the contract. 

Per the terms of the contract, as 

President Emeritus, the University 
will give Schlissel $36,000 per fiscal 
year “to be used in (his) discretion to 
support (his) activities as President 
Emeritus.” He will also be given an 
office space on Central Campus, a 
parking space and an office assis-
tant. The money, office and office 
assistant will be for an initial term 
of seven years through July 1, 2030, 

with automatic renewal every three 
years unless terminated or modified 
by the Board of Regents. 

In his first year after resigna-

tion, Schlissel will serve as a special 
advisor, working under the Board of 
Regents to “promote the interests of 
the University, support a new presi-
dent in ensuring a successful transi-
tion, and perform other reasonable, 
appropriate duties,” according to the 
contract. While Schlissel serves as 
special advisor, he will be paid his 
current presidential salary and also 
receive a monthly $5,000 housing 
allowance, as he must move out of 
the presidential house on South Uni-
versity no more than 30 days after 
ending his presidency. 

If a new president is appointed 

after Jan. 1, 2023 and before Schlis-
sel’s resignation date of July 1, 2023, 
Schlissel will start immediately as 
special advisor. 

After he finishes his term as spe-

cial advisor, he can go on leave for 

one year — paid at the rate of his cur-
rent presidential salary. He can then 
return to the University as a tenured 
faculty member in the Microbiology 
and Immunology department and 
the Molecular, Cellular and Develop-
mental Biology department.

Per the terms of the contract, the 

University will provide Schlissel 
with a $2 million starting fund — 
which he can begin using while serv-
ing as special advisor — to establish 
a research laboratory for his tenured 
faculty position. His salary as a ten-
ured faculty member will be at least 
50% of his current presidential sal-
ary.

If Schlissel decides to retire on 

or after June 30, 2023, his service 
requirements will be waived. His 
retirement package currently pro-
vides that “the University will match 
the President’s five percent contri-
bution with a ten percent Univer-
sity contribution on salary of up to 
$290,000,” according to the contract.

MS: I’m always working with the 

board, and I work incredibly closely 
with them. I’d say there isn’t a week 
that goes by that I’m not speaking 
with 
several 
board 
members 

individually. I think the board is as 
responsible as I am for any of the 
successes that the University’s had 
since I’ve been here. We deal with 
the same challenges together, the 
challenges are very intense — we’re 
living in a very critical era — and just 
like any personal set of relationships 
that are intense, they go up and down. 

I don’t talk in the media about 

private conversations with the board 
— it’s just not appropriate — but I’d say 
there’s great alignment between the 
board and myself of what we’re trying 
to accomplish for the University: to 
continue to make it an outstanding 
educational institution where folks 
can come and study regardless of 
their wealth or their background, 
and a diverse community that’s doing 
research that makes a difference 
in the world, and we’re completely 
aligned on that. There are always ups 
and downs. 

I wouldn’t give credence to 

individual news articles, certainly 
ones that don’t cite name sources. It’s 
always easier that way, and what can 
I say?

TMD: Many have criticized the 

amount of money offered in your 
exit package and the fact that it was 
negotiated in secret. What do you say 
to these criticisms, and do you believe 
that your package is too generous?

MS: I’d say that the package is 

really the contract that I signed three 
or so years ago when I was renewed 
for a second five-year term, and what 
the agreement does is it changes the 
term from 10 years to nine years, 
and keeps me on as a consultant for 
that 10th year. It seems like a fair 
way forward to the board and to me. 
That’s basically it. It’s not new. The 
agreement itself that you’re referring 
to is new, but the terms are really 
basically the terms of my renewal 
back in 2018.

TMD: A Free Press report also 

details changes in funding the 
Detroit Center for Innovation that 
were not shared with the regents. 
The report states that the original 
plan for the center ended and you and 
Stephen Ross negotiated with Ilitch 
Holdings to gain the firm’s support 
of the center. What is the current 
status of plans for the center, and why 
was the board not informed of the 
negotiations? 

MS: The work of developing the 

Detroit Center for Innovation had 
really taken place between Stephen 
Ross and his company Related, and 
initially with Bedrock, Dan Gilbert’s 
company. We were a partner to the 
extent that once the whole complex 
was built, we were going to run the 
educational programs we spoke 

about. I was not present for the 
detailed discussions between Ross 
and Gilbert that broke down, and 
then Ross began looking for other 
partners, as has been reported in the 
media. Again, that wasn’t part of our 
part of the deal — we were interested 
to see how that turned out. 

And at the time that the news 

broke about the DCI, I wasn’t 
aware of any signed agreement for 
a different partnership. I knew Mr. 
Ross was in conversation. The board 
asked me to hold off while the dust 
settles, and now that the pandemic 
is on the wane, but will have changed 
the world, we need to take a deep 
breath and consider whether the 
DCI project is the right thing for the 
University to do. I think that was a 
really fair request for the board that 
we reconsider it in a post-pandemic 
world. I’m hopeful that we still get to 
do the project, but again, that’ll be a 
matter of discussion with the board.

TMD: Will you have any role in 

the search or appointment of your 
successor, and does the Board of 
Regents have any kind of timeline for 
when that decision will be made or 
when the University community will 
be receiving any updates?

MS: I can’t speak for the board 

in terms of any timing or any details 
of the search. Traditionally, sitting 
presidents don’t play a role in the 
actual search but do play a role at the 
stage of helping with the transition, 
and that’s what I promised the board. 
But I told the board I’m happy to do 

whatever they’d like me to do to help, 
because I’m invested in the future 
success of the University for the 
next two years where I remain the 
president and then thereafter.

TMD: It was announced that 

you recently signed a contract, as we 
discussed earlier, agreeing to a role 
as president emeritus following the 
expiration of your presidency in June 
2023. Can you elaborate on what role 
you’ll have at the University following 
your resignation?

Schlissel: President Emeriti help 

raise money and help represent the 
university, but not in the capacity that 
would create any confusion with the 
true president. For example, President 
Coleman, she’s president emerita, but 
nobody thinks she’s still in charge. 
That would be my role. 

But after I’m done as president, 

I’ll still be a tenured member of the 
Michigan faculty. I’m a professor of 
medicine, I’m a professor of molecular 
biology and biochemistry, and I’m in 
a number of divisions in the Medical 
School. So most likely I’d end up 
starting to teach again and resuming 
a small research lab studying the 
immune system, which is what I did 
for 25 years before I started doing this 
administrative work.

Warning: 
sexual 

assault

A story published by Business 

Insider Oct. 5 detailed decades of 
sexual misconduct tied to Young 
Life, an international youth 
Christian 
organization, 
with 

incidences of sexual assault of 
former members reported across 
the country — including at the 
University of Michigan. 

Public Health senior Maddie 
Malvitz and LSA senior Becca 

Wong, two of the students inter-
viewed as part of the Business 
Insider story, both began attend-
ing Young Life meetings at the 
University as freshmen. Wong 
was promoted to a leadership 
position her sophomore year.

The two told Business Insid-

er that a male student leader 
harassed Wong at a block party in 
2019 and later that night, invited 
Malvitz to a house where he and 
other Young Life members lived. 

Instead of going to that house, 

Malvitz told Business Insider 
the student leader took Malvitz 
to the back of another house 
and forced her to perform oral 
sex on him. Following the inci-
dent, Malvitz said she went to 
the house where other Young 
Life members lived and slept on 
their couch while the student 
leader went upstairs. During the 
middle of the night, Malvitz said 
the student leader came down-
stairs and demanded they have 
penetrative intercourse; Malvitz 
refused. 

When Malvitz told Wong 

about the assault in May 2020, 
Wong was a student leader and 
reported the incident to the 
University’s Young Life leader-
ship immediately, according to 
the Business Insider story. After 
doing so, Wong said she was 
called to meet with leadership 
over Zoom, where they informed 
her that she would be terminated 
from the organization.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Wong said she 
felt blindsided by this decision 
and even afterwards still wanted 
to be a part of the organization. 
Wong said it took her time to fully 
recognize the organization’s sys-
temic issues. 

“It’s a very harmful experi-

ence but when you’re in (Young 
Life), you really drink the Kool 

Aid and you really believe every-
thing they’re doing,” Wong said. 
“Leaving Young Life was a very 
eye-opening experience, and you 
can’t really see the problems in 
Young Life until you’re out of it.”

Malvitz echoed Wong’s point, 

saying that after her assault and 
what she believes to be the orga-
nization’s manipulative handling 
of the report, she began experi-
encing religious trauma that she 
still struggles with. 

“I think my trust in church 

structures 
in 
general 
has 

declined 
extremely,” 
Malvitz 

said. “(Young Life) has hurt me so 
much further than I can explain 
by using the word of God or say-
ing that what they were doing 
was more important than the 
pain I was going through.”

Wong said she believes Young 

Life will not take proper action 
unless they are prompted to by 
people speaking out. She refer-
enced the #DoBetterYoungLife 
movement, an online forum space 
dedicated to those who have been 
harmed by Young Life and want 
to share their experiences, as an 
example of how members con-
tinue to speak about their experi-
ences in the organization. 

“I do not believe that Young 

Life can change internally,” 
Wong said. “I think the exter-
nal pressure is the only thing 
that will force them to change 
because we’ve seen how they 
responded to the #DoBetterY-
oungLife movement and how 
they responded to so many sto-
ries of people being hurt by their 
homophobia and their homopho-
bic policies, and they responded 
with, ‘We’re not changing our 
policies. This is the Word of 
God.”’

In an email statement to The 

Daily, the Young Life parent 
organization’s communications 
office said they take all allega-
tions of sexual misconduct and 
harassment seriously, and “no 
one guilty of violating or abus-
ing another individual is allowed 
to continue in relationship with 
Young Life.” The organization 
also said they deny all claims 
from Malvitz and Wong.

“Regarding the specific alle-

gations that Maddie Malvitz 
and Becca Wong assert, this is 
an active claim in the EEOC, so 
we cannot comment. However, 
Young Life has denied all claims 
and is defending itself vigorous-
ly,” the statement reads.

The Daily also contacted the 

University’s Young Life branch 

but did not receive a response in 
time for publication. 

Wong and Malvitz also dis-

cussed the shooter threat that 
was directed at women and shook 
the University campus over the 
weekend, specifically mentioning 
how the threat appeared to target 
sexual assault survivors. Wong 
said the threat is one example of 
the added stress many survivors 
have about reporting incidences 
of sexual violence. 

“Regardless of whether or not 

the threat is real, the fear is real 
and we all experienced that,” 
Wong said. “I wish the Univer-
sity would have taken this more 
seriously.”

The University investigated 

the threat with the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and 
decided there was no harm to the 
campus, allowing classes to con-
tinue in-person as normal. More 
than a thousand students signed 
a petition asking the University 
to hold all classes and activities 
remotely Monday. 

Malvitz said she too was 

unsettled by the threat, espe-
cially considering the fact that 
the Business Insider article was 
set to publish within a few days 
following. Malvitz said she was 
disappointed by the University’s 
response and its lack of recogni-
tion of how the threat specifically 
survivors of sexual assault. 

“There’s these constant lit-

tle aggressions that make you 
not want to speak on campus,” 
Malvitz said. “A lot of these 
announcements from the Uni-
versity were just saying, ‘It’s okay 
now. We are safe.’ They weren’t 
talking about that it is directly 
targeting women in the #MeToo 
Movement It’s dangerous to not 
notice the violent factors that are 
going on on campus, and acting 
like they’re not happening makes 
it so much worse.”

Wong said she believes it is 

important to speak about these 
issues. If survivors choose to 
report, Wong said, she hopes they 
feel safe and supported.

“It’s important to speak truth 

into these issues, because a main 
weapon of oppression is silence 
and Young Life has silenced a lot 
of us,” Wong said. “That’s why 
we’re speaking out today. We will 
not be silenced and we are not 
going away.”

What is the ‘Go Blue Flu’? 
People are more sensitized and aware of coughing, illness 
now given the pandemic, epidemoiology professor explains

The “Go Blue Flu” and the “col-

lege plague” are just some of the 
witty names students at the Uni-
versity of Michigan and across the 
country have termed the back-to-
school sickness that has infiltrated 
lecture halls with dry coughs and 
runny noses. 

Though students across campus 

may be experiencing flu-like symp-
toms, the flu season has yet to come. 
So what is the source of this seem-
ingly infectious illness? 

The Michigan Daily sat with 

Dr. Joseph Eisenberg, U-M pro-
fessor and chair of the epidemiol-
ogy department and public health 
expert, to get answers as to what 
these symptoms could possibly be 
from.

Is the Go Blue Flu really the flu?
According to the Centers for Dis-

ease Control and Prevention, the 
influenza virus can be contracted 
year-round, but getting the flu is 
quite common in the fall and win-
ter months, specifically between 
December and March. Eisenberg 
said an early September-October flu 
season is highly unlikely.

“As the weather gets colder, peo-

ple are inside more … so transmis-
sion is more efficient with respect 

to aerosol droplets, very much 
similar to COVID-19, which does 
better in colder and drier environ-
ments,” Eisenberg said. “However, 
early October is quite early for the 
flu season. There (are) also a lot of 
other viruses that cause the com-
mon cold.”

Eisenberg said it is more likely 

that students are infected with 
other respiratory viruses that are 
not COVID-19. These can include 
various respiratory syncytial virus-
es like rhinoviruses, the other coro-
naviruses and others. 

Why is everyone sick?
Some studies suggest that quar-

antine and isolation lead to a weak-
ened immune system. Eisenberg 
said this could be the biggest expla-
nation as to why so many students 
are experiencing flu-like symptoms. 
He also explained that the congre-
gation of students across the coun-
try in one city, or even one lecture 
hall, can expose everyone to viruses 
that may have been localized to one 
community or general area back 
home.

“If people have not been exposed 

to (viruses that cause the common 
cold) in a long time because they’ve 
been mostly at home and not social-
izing, their immune system is not 
quite primed to fight off viruses,” 
Eisenberg said. 

Even as COVID-19 cases at the 

University remain low, some U-M 
students have said they have wit-
nessed their peers coughing in their 
classrooms and lecture halls. Eisen-
berg noted that, after experiencing 
a pandemic, most people are no 
longer desensitized to coughs and 
sneezes that would have otherwise 
gone unnoticed in the past.

“The flu pre-COVID really 

wasn’t on students’ radar and I 
think that COVID-19 has increased 
our awareness of coughing,” Eisen-
berg said. “It used to be acceptable 
to come to class or work with a 
cough. The majority of people prob-
ably wouldn’t have given it a second 
thought. I think that people are sen-
sitized to coughing now in a way 
they probably weren’t two years 
ago.”

Dr. Erik Nielsen, professor of 

molecular, cellular and develop-
mental biology, teaches roughly 
150 students in a single lecture hall 
twice a week. He said that it is not 
uncommon to see people coughing 
this time of year. 

“It’s not uncommon to see this 

many people coughing a little bit, 
but I think we are more aware of 
it now — (we) have been isolating 
for a year and have not been hear-
ing these coughs in large groups of 
people in a long time,” Nielsen said.

Having just transferred from 

Plekhanov 
Russian 
University 

of Economics in Moscow, Rus-
sia, LSA junior Veronika Volevich 
was looking forward to attend-
ing her first football game in The 
Big House. She made a post in 
the “Buying and Selling Tickets 
UMich” Facebook group on Sept. 4 
requesting that anyone selling tick-
ets to the football games on Sept. 11 
or Sept. 18 comment or contact her 
privately.

Within a few minutes, Volevich 

said she got a message from Face-
book user “Elena Beretta.” Beretta 
told Volevich she had tickets for 
both games in Section 31, Row 10 
and asked Volevich to make an 
offer. Volevich suggested $40 per 
ticket and said Beretta immedi-
ately accepted.

But an hour after Volevich 

electronically paid Beretta for the 
tickets, Volevich said she still had 
not received them. When Beretta 
stopped responding to her private 
messages, Volevich realized it had 
been a scam.

“Then I decided to make a post 

about (Beretta) in the (Buying and 
Selling) group,” Volevich said. “I 
received three or four messages 
from other people saying … she had 
used the same exact strategy on 
them.”

Associate 
Athletic 
Director 

Kurt Svoboda confirmed in an 
email to The Michigan Daily that 
this is the first year that student 
football tickets have been solely 
distributed online. Ice hockey and 
basketball student tickets have 
been virtual since 2019.

“We do not have plans to return 

to physical tickets in the future 
but we will continue to follow best 
practices within the industry to 
provide security within the tick-
eting landscape,” Svoboda wrote. 
“Mobile ticketing is proven to be 
far more safe and effective than 
paper tickets as it relates to authen-
ticity.”

Volevich is not the only student 

who has recently been scammed 
while trying to buy student tickets 
through social media.

After talking to several other 

students with similar experiences 
to Volevich, The Michigan Daily 
found three major warning signs 
to look out for — and ways to miti-
gate the risks — when trying to buy 
student tickets online.

“I know I’ll never get my money 

back,” Volevich said. “I just want to 
warn other people so this doesn’t 
happen to them.”

Red Flag 1: Pressuring the 

buyer to pay the full cost before 
sending the ticket

LSA sophomore Audrey Beach 

was scammed on Aug. 21 while 
trying to purchase an entire season 
of student tickets through the Buy-
ing and Selling Facebook group. 
Beach said a scammer by the name 

of “Reilly Kat” liked Beach’s post in 
the group, so Beach reached out to 
her to purchase the ticket

Once they agreed on a price, 

Beach said Kat told her to set up 
a Zelle account and transfer the 
money immediately if she wanted 
the tickets.

“She was definitely pressuring 

me into paying right away, like as 
soon as possible, and to get a dif-
ferent payment app that was better 
for her,” Beach said.

Beach said she was out shopping 

with her family at the time and told 
Kat she wanted to wait until she 
got home to set up a Zelle account 
on her laptop. Kat insinuated she 
would sell the tickets to someone 
else if Beach took too long, suggest-
ing she use her phone to transfer 
the payment if she was serious 
about buying.

Since there were no live specta-

tors at football games last fall, this 
was Beach’s first time purchasing 
tickets to a U-M football game. She 
said if she had known more about 
how tickets were transferred, the 
value of season tickets or the tricks 
scammers traditionally used, she 
would have been more careful.

“If I had that experience last 

year, if I had ever been to a football 
game … I definitely would have had 
a better understanding of what I 
was trying to buy and how to do it 
safely,” Beach said.

To protect both buyers and sell-

ers from losing the full value of the 
tickets, Beach and other scam vic-
tims suggested sending half of the 
cost before receiving the tickets 
and the other half after.

Red Flag 2: Asking that money 

be sent through new payment 
applications

All of the scam victims inter-

viewed by The Daily said the Pay-
Pal-owned application Venmo — a 
middle ground between a payment 
transfer service and social media 
platform — is their preferred inter-
face for virtual payments. Venmo 
appears frequently in lists of the 
applications college students use 
on a daily basis, and a third of 
Venmo users are between the ages 
of 18 and 24.

Volevich said Beretta refused 

to use Venmo when they were dis-
cussing how the payment would be 
sent.

“(Beretta) said she would prefer 

either Zelle or Apple Pay,” Volev-
ich said. “I found that weird since 
everyone has Venmo.”

Volevich said she consented 

to using Apple Pay since she had 
used it previously to make con-
tactless payments at local busi-
nesses. When a pop-up warning 
screen appeared indicating that 
this particular Apple Pay transfer 
might not be safe, Volevich said, 
she assumed Apple Pay flagged 
any non-commercial transfer and 
dismissed it.

“When I started the Apple 

Pay transaction, I was warned by 
Apple that this might be fraud,” 
Volevich said. “I assumed that 

since I’m transferring money to 
another person, Apple Pay might 
just suspect fraud, so I didn’t pay 
attention to it.”

Besides paying attention to 

explicit security messages from 
payment apps, Volevich and other 
scam victims recommended telling 
the seller they are not comfortable 
using certain payment methods 
they are less familiar with. They 
also suggested that if the buyer 
and seller can arrange to meet in 
person while the transaction takes 
place, it would increase transpar-
ency and reduce scam risks.

“I would ask the (seller) to meet 

in person,” Volevich said. “Since 
all (students) live in Ann Arbor 
mostly, it’s not that hard to meet in 
person.”

Red flag 3: Facebook account 

is not active and person’s stu-
dent status is unclear

If they had paid better attention 

to key details on the scammer’s 
Facebook pages, all of the scam 
victims said they might not have 
been so quick to send money to 
strangers.

2019 University alum Zena 

Shunnar told The Daily when 
she was a student, she had never 
heard of scams involving tickets 
to U-M sporting events. But when 
she was scammed while trying to 
buy three tickets over Facebook 
from a “fellow alum” to the Sept. 
11 game, Shunnar said she found 
out the hard way that things had 
changed.

Shunnar messaged “Simone 

Williams” who claimed she had 
tickets available. Williams’ profile 
mentioned she had recently moved 
to Paris and had studied at École 
Polytechnique de Milan in Milan, 
Italy. Shunnar said she thought 
this was odd, but gave Williams 
the benefit of the doubt, supposing 
Williams wanted to sell her tickets 
because of her current residence in 
Europe.

“I kind of made up the story in 

my head on why she could be sell-
ing these tickets and why it says she 
lives in Paris now,” Shunnar said.

LSA senior Julia Smoot said the 

individual who scammed her had 
very few Facebook friends and 
only had posted a couple of times — 
with each post receiving zero likes. 
Similar to Shunnar, Smoot said she 
had also purchased paper tickets 
several times before and had never 
had any issues.

Both 
recommended 
taking 

more time to identify inconsisten-
cies on the Facebook profiles of 
prospective sellers or buyers. They 
also both suggested using MCom-
munity to verify their student or 
alumni status.

“I started looking up (student 

ticket sellers) in MCommunity and 
I found at least two other people 
who didn’t go here,” Smoot said. 
“This one guy just kept saying, 
‘you’re safe with me, you’re safe 
with me.’ He did not go here.”

RESEARCH


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

4 — Wednesday, October 13, 2021

I’ll state my case plainly: Paul Hollywood is 

a sex symbol. The British celebrity baker and 
host of the “Great British Bake Off” may be a bit 
of an asshole, sure, but so were James Dean and 
President Kennedy.

A quick visit to Twitter reveals a clearly 

polarized public opinion. While one twitter 
user tweeted “If Paul Hollywood wants a thick 
bottom he knows where to find me,” another 
said: “Thinking about saying to paul Hollywood 
‘sorry daddy I’ve been a bad bad baker.’” However, 
the best comment was that “Paul Hollywood is 
known as a silver fox because he eats voles and 
urinates in bins.”

Hollywood’s sex appeal is a running joke on the 

show as well. In one episode, host Noel Fielding 
likened Paul’s rear end to “two beige moons, 
dancing in the sky,” which contestant Maggie 
remarked was a “rather nice” thought. Stickers 
of Hollywood with chiseled abs can be found on 
Etsy (and made a cameo in episode one of the 
latest season). 

Former stars have criticized Hollywood’s 

harshness, and fans love to hate him when he 
makes contestants cry, but deep down, I think 
many can agree that “Paul Hollywood is such a 
dilf bro, omg,” a statement which was (naturally) 
followed by two agonized emojis.

But what makes Hollywood so sexy? It 

certainly isn’t the way he berates old ladies. 
There’s nothing sexy about that. But it’s so easy 
to forget his brutishness when you see him 
extend his right hand for the elusive Hollywood 
Handshake. Reserved only for what he deems 
the most impressive bakes, the handshake is 
arguably more coveted than the weekly “Star 
Baker” crown. That meaty paw, connected to a 
forearm — thickened by years of kneading dough 
— that emerges from a sleazily cuffed and coolly 
untucked shirt, is enough to send shivers down 
spines.

The effect of the shake remains the same from 

season to season: A strong hand extended in silent 
praise from an otherwise frigid critic is hot, if 
you’re the kind of person who thrives on positive 
reinforcement. I’ll pass that off to the fact that I’m 
a Leo, but feel free to read into it further.

If there’s something else to the Hollywood 

Handshake, it’s the oceanic eyes. With a piercing 
blue stare, Hollywood must have X-ray vision 
and can probably read minds. Nestled beneath a 
furrowed brow, Hollywood’s “fuck me” eyes could 

melt butter, which he’d then work into the perfectly 
un-soggy bottom of a cheesecake or something.

The final piece to this puzzle, and the one 

that has nothing to do with Paul’s lumberjack 
limbs or Ice King eyes, is baking itself. In a very 
cottagecore (i.e., antithetical to the traditionally 
masculine Paul) way, there’s nothing sexier 
than a loaf of bread, baked just for you. The gift 
of comforting carbohydrates, the luscious and 
erotic aroma of yeasted dough, the time spent by 
a loved one so that you may slather a chunk of hot 
sourdough with butter — bread and baking are a 
love language.

Especially for the post-lockdown baking crowd, 

the comfort and love found at the bottom of a cake 
pan is certainly part of the hobby’s appeal. It isn’t a 
great leap to suggest that baking is intimate, sexual, 
erotic. There are 200k posts tagged #crumbshot 
on Instagram. Beyond the blooming aromas and 
communal joy of a batch of cookies, the art of 
baking is arousing even when no one is there to 
share. The way a roll gently rises and falls of its own 
accord in the distorted heat of an oven, the dregs 
of batter licked flagrantly from a spatula, the soft 
sizzle of a cooling loaf in a quiet room.

The eroticism of baking is a big part of 

Hollywood’s charm. As a prominent face of 
21st-century baking, he stands for it all. Anyone 
who can make such delightful things, and 
especially one who can show you how it’s done, is 
worthy of a desiring, perhaps lustful eye.

Hollywood is no “nice guy,” and he certainly 

doesn’t finish last (a real James Bond, he races 
Aston Martins in his free time). He has his issues 
too, cheating on his now ex-wife with a co-host 
on another baking competition in 2013. This he 
called “the biggest mistake of my life” in a BBC 
interview at the time, but what else do you say 
about this sort of thing? Another big mistake in 
his life was in 2003, when Hollywood dressed 
up as a Nazi for a New Years’ Eve, to which he 
responded, 14 years hence, “ 
I am absolutely 

devastated if this caused offence to anyone.” The 
classic non-apology, shifting blame to those who 
were offended and then proceeding to use his 

WWII-veteran grandfather as proof that he does 
not like Nazis. 

This is to say that Hollywood is not a perfect 

man. He makes old ladies cry and does his hair 
like a repressed Guy Fieri. These problematic 
aspects of Hollywood’s history might make him 
less attractive, but they don’t kill his “Bake Off” sex 
appeal. His flaws notwithstanding, he remains a 
sex symbol for lovers of baked goods everywhere. 

The celebrity chef community could do with 

a page from Hollywood’s book. The signature 
flames that Fieri wears on his clothing are frozen 
solid in Paul’s eyes. The suave dad style of Bobby 
Flay is given a burly, British twist. Even Giada De 
Laurentiis’s smile is mercifully softened into a sly, 
all-knowing grin. In fairness, I’ll concede that, 
style-wise, Hollywood is lacking. But his hands 
are his hands, no matter the sleeve from which 
they emerge.

Like art, food has the ability to bring us 

back to our fondest memories of people, 

places and moments. Food can comfort us 

and help us feel connected to others, but it 

can also force us to confront our deepest 

insecurities. We make countless movies, 

television shows, cookbooks, songs and 

TikToks honoring food. And I, for one, will 

never stop getting sucked into the trap of 

watching videos of a stranger cook and 

consume their own delicious creation in the 

wee hours of the nighttime.

In our second B-Side of the 2021-22 school 

year, Daily Arts investigates our deep-rooted 

relationship with food and how it influences 

our self-expression in all forms of art — 

literature, film, social media and much more. 

This is the Food B-Side.

I spent almost the entirety of my 

pandemic year in my apartment in 
Ann Arbor, which is to say that I spent 
it on my couch in front of my TV. The 
early days of quarantine have mostly 
turned to mush in my memory, but 
one thing I can remember distinctly 
is watching Claire Saffitz make 
gourmet Girl Scout Cookies.

From March 2020 through May 

2020, content from the Bon Appétit 
YouTube channel was more or less 
the only thing I cared to put on TV. 
I was a fan before the pandemic, but 
something in my anxiety-addled 
brain latched onto Bon Appetit in a 
new way during that time. Maybe 
it was that the Test Kitchen chefs 
were easy to develop parasocial 
relationships with (I still think that 
Gaby Melian and I would really get 
along in real life), or that the process 
of cooking, especially in the hands of 
these experts, was just soothing to 
watch. Maybe there was a little bit 
of schadenfreude (an uber-German 
concept describing the sort of 
perverse pleasure you can get from 
other people’s misfortune) involved 
as well. Part of the fun of watching 
“Gourmet Makes” was wondering 
if, after days of intense frustration, 
Saffitz would ever crack the recipe 
for gourmet Starburst.

I don’t tend to think of food as an 

escape, but Bon Appétit made it feel 
like one. There was something warm 
and welcoming about watching 
these smiling, personable chefs 

make beautiful dishes in a bright 
kitchen. They talked to the camera 
as if everyone on the other side was 
a friend. Especially when I was 
sad, ordering in on most nights and 
isolated from most of my real-life 
friends, each video was like a shot of 
serotonin to my brain.

However, 
everything 
came 

crashing down in early June. A 
picture of Bon Appétit’s then-
Editor-in-Chief 
Adam 
Rapoport 

in brownface surfaced on Twitter, 
which opened an enormous can of 
worms not only about his conduct 
at Bon Appétit but about the way 
people of color were being treated 
on the channel. Sohla El-Waylly was 
the first of the Test Kitchen chefs to 
reveal an incredible pay disparity 
between 
white 
employees 
and 

employees of color. Although she was 
quickly becoming one of the most 
popular chefs on the channel, she 
had not been compensated for any 
of her video appearances and was 
making significantly less than white 
contributors.

Things 
spiraled 
from 
there. 

Rapoport resigned, most white 
Test Kitchen chefs publicly vowed 
not to appear in Bon Appétit videos

I love to read about food, especially 

when I’m down. Apart from being 
necessary for survival, great food 
is a compositional masterpiece, a 
labor of love and a sensory puzzle. 
Reading about food satisfies an 
elementary sense of curiosity while 
offering delectable imagery and a 
healthy dose of escapism. More than 
anything, it is comfort. Here are the 
books I turn to:

Food for thought: “Sourdough” 

by Robin Sloan

“Sourdough” 
is 
warm 
and 

fluffy, with the funkiness of a good 
starter. The story follows Lois, a 
software engineer who moves to 
San Francisco, where she starts 
to bake sourdough bread with a 
mysteriously animate starter culture. 
One would expect a book about 
bread to be apolitical; however, as 
you keep flipping through the pages, 
it’s easier to see undercurrents of 
Sloan’s commentary on technology 
and how it changes culture (as in a 
“fungal party hellscape,” but also the 
characteristic features of everyday 
life). Sloan asserts that “food is history 
of the deepest kind,” and follows Lois 
as she overworks herself at her day 
job while uncovering the source of 
her fungal party hellscape. 

Lois continually questions her 

work. Her programming job needs 
her to solve an endless scope of new 
problems: “Baking, by contrast, was 
solving the same problem over and 
over again, because every time, the 
solution was consumed. I mean, 
really: chewed and digested. Thus, 
the problem was ongoing. Thus, the 
problem was perhaps the point.” 
“Sourdough” wraps you in a soft, 
disarming hug — its taste is strongly 

thought-provoking yet wholesome. 
When reading it for the first time, I 
remember finishing a chapter, sighing 
contentedly and falling asleep. It’s not 
a book you want to down; instead, 
you want to savor it. Solving the 
same problem over and over again 
isn’t such a bad thing; Lois loves the 
meditative process of baking bread, 
and I love the equally generative 
process of reading “Sourdough.”

Bread 
and 
circuses: 
“The 

Hunger 
Games” 
by 
Suzanne 

Collins

This one isn’t technically comfort 

food, but it’s a comfort read, and 
ultimately, a story about food. Set 
in a world of food insecurity where 
foraging is necessary, “The Hunger 
Games” is a dystopia where children 

are forced to fight to the death in 
order to feed their communities. 
There are too many examples to 
name: Characters are named after 
edible plants, like Katniss and Prim. 
There are symbols of hope, like 
dandelions, which characters forage 
after starving for weeks. And who 
could forget the boy with the bread? 
As Katniss moves through different 
worlds, she makes a point to notice 

the food around her. The game she 
hunts in District 12 is sparse but fresh; 
berries are plucked directly from 
bushes. As Katniss is first introduced 
to the rich, overly luxurious foods 
of the Capitol, she fights “to keep it 
down,” overwhelmed: “What must 
it be like, I wonder, to live in a world 
where food appears at the press of a 
button?” 

The more I think about it, it’s 

messed up to say that “The Hunger 
Games” is a comfort read — after 
re-reading the young adult series so 
many times in middle school with 
friends, I’ve fallen into the same 
trap as the Capitol’s audience. The 
world is ridiculously captivating: 
the political intrigue, the delectable 
luxuries of the Capitol and of course, 

the star-crossed lovers from District 
12. Suzanne Collins used the trilogy 
to comment on how, as long as we 
receive our panem et circenses, we 
can neglect humanity. To love “The 
Hunger Games” is, quite literally, 
to enjoy our bread and circuses. But 
damn, if it isn’t a juicy read.

Food is a powerful thing. It has 

brought people together for centuries, 
between 
families, 
communities 

and cultures. From birthdays to 
neighborhood potlucks to holiday 
feasts, the nature of sharing food 
with others is a tradition carved into 
our very existence. We’ve found 
bread with score marks in the ashes 
of Vesuvius, indicating its intention to 
be divided and shared, and a OnePoll 
study found that 84% of Americans 
say food has the power to connect 
people of different cultures and 
backgrounds. Indeed, the sharing 
of food and recipes is nothing new, 
but recently there’s been a shift in 
how we share recipes, as well as who 
shares them. 

The digital age has brought on the 

popularity of cooking videos. TikTok 
in particular, with its unparalleled 
ability to create widespread virality, is 
a giant in the age of the viral food trend. 
You might remember Gigi Hadid’s 
famous pasta alla vodka recipe, 
simply consisting of fried onions and 
garlic, heavy whipping cream, tomato 
sauce, vodka and the pasta of your 
choice, or the feta pasta trend that 
was so popular it caused feta cheese 
shortages. Hadid was obviously not 
the originator of pasta alla vodka and 
feta cheese is no new ingredient, but 
with this new era, watching cooking 
videos is far from an isolated moment 
an individual experiences before 
dinnertime. Rather, it is a concept 
commonly shared and discussed 
throughout popular culture. 

This isn’t to say food trends are 

a new concept — I mean who could 
forget the Jello trends of the 1950s, 
which 
included 
adding 
gelatin 

to practically everything, from a 

vegetable and sugar mix called 
“Perfection Salad,” to submerging 
lamb chops in the mix. Even in more 
recent times, there has been the 
avocado trend of the 2010s, which 
caused the relentless slander of 
millennials and their spending habits. 
Yet the recent rise of food trends 
originating from TikTok is different 
from the trends of the past: The 
food is usually cooked rather than 
bought and can be made by anyone, 
often including younger generations. 
The most viral food trends usually 
use simple, accessible ingredients 
and don’t require much skill to 
master. Part of the allure is that even 
someone with very limited cooking 
experience can watch a minute-long 
video and think, “I can do that!” (And 

of course, the foods must also look 
enticing enough to warrant the desire 
to make them.) 

Why is this change so significant? 

We have lived in a popular culture 
that has frowned upon eating or has 
provided narrow definitions for what 
we’re allowed to talk about. We can 
be quirky with phrases like “I love 
pizza!” and “Don’t talk to me before 
I’ve had my coffee!” but there are 

unspoken limits. Dialogue usually 
doesn’t center around nourishing, 
balanced meals, and rarely centers 
around the process of cooking. Yet 
the emergence of viral cooking 
videos on TikTok, a platform where 
62% of users are between the ages of 
10 and 29, has changed this, and more 
people who have never cooked before 
are now encountering fun cooking 
content that they can replicate 
themselves. 

There are benefits to conversations 

about food that aren’t centered 
around caloric intake or body image. 
Normalizing society’s relationship 
with food, particularly within the 
digital world that so often fills our 
feeds with unattainable ideals, is a 
healthy thing. While 69% of girls 

ages 10 to 18 state that photographs 
of models and celebrities in the media 
motivated their “ideal” body shape, 
it can be helpful to build a neutral 
relationship with food — one that isn’t 
motivated by any endgame outside of 
creating something tasty for the fun 
of it.

Content warning: Disordered eating
Writing was how I defined myself before 

food was all that mattered. I was a writer. 
This was the part of me that connected to the 
world outside of myself, what I thought about 
and what I wanted to do. I lived to tell stories. 
They could be stories I made up, stories of 
other people or stories of my own. It wasn’t 
something I questioned or decided to care 
about; it had always been there, as much a part 
of me as my arms and hair and stomach.

I have thought many times about what 

caused the descent that stripped me of 
everything I once cared for, including my art.

I hated getting bigger from as long ago as I 

can remember. I compared myself to everyone 
at least as far back as my time on a gymnastics 
team. In middle and high school, I was shy 
and not good at connecting with people, and 
instead of trying to get better, I told myself I 
had nothing to offer. My personality was not 
enough. Being good at writing certainly wasn’t 
enough. I didn’t know how to improve those 
things, but people told me I was pretty, so I 
clung to the hope that I would find respect and 
friendship by being “the pretty one.” I thought 
that since people commented on it, if I could 
improve my body, make it perfect, then it 
would somehow solve all my problems.

My body mattered before food did, but 

then the two became tangled together and 
impossible to separate. Creativity stopped 

mattering and turned scary. It was something I 
couldn’t control. I never knew if it would come 
to my rescue or push me away, making me feel 
worthless. I stopped hoping for inspiration in 
favor of control. So the mirror and the scale 
and whether I ate only soup for dinner the 
night before became ways of determining how 
I was allowed to feel, what I was allowed to 
do, what I could eat and what stricter rules I 
would implement for myself.

It might seem like disordered eating would 

leave you with more time. If I was eating less, 
becoming less, food would take up less space in 
my life. Instead, it took over and erased every 
other part of me. I spent less time eating, but I 
spent every second of every day thinking about 
food, and everything else that once mattered 
faded away. How could something as trivial 
as my artistic pursuits matter when I was 
missing something I needed to survive?

I did not realize I was being drained of 

my passion for writing at first. There was a 
wilting part of my brain that still liked the 
idea of telling stories, but I had no energy to do 
it myself, and even if I had, I would not have 
known what to write about. 

I still said that I liked writing, but at the end 

of high school, when the writing program I 
was in concluded, I had no plans to continue 
the craft. I was preoccupied with scheduling 
times to go to the gym and filling the tiring 
hours of the afternoons trying to satisfy my 
hunger with vivid images of eating chocolate 
cake. The world around me that had once 
ignited ideas in my mind was bleak, and I 
didn’t notice that I stopped having ideas 

because there was no spare room in my head 
for them.

Advice books for writers said to “write 

what you know” and “find a subject you care 
about,” but the only thing I knew was the pain 
of being consumed by thoughts of food, and I 
couldn’t write about it, because I didn’t want it 
to matter. 

I hated the part of me that cared so much 

about it and, beyond not finding a subject I 
loved, writing itself was no longer a part of 
me or a way to explore my world. Besides, that 
world had turned so far inward and became 
focused on something I couldn’t write about, 
even if I wanted to.

In my second semester of college, years 

after I started to lose my passion for writing, 
I could go several hours at a time without 
thinking about when and what I would eat 
next. I still cared about my disordered eating, 
but my fascination involved looking back on 
my experience from the other side. I wanted 
to express myself again, to say what I had felt 
when I was trapped inside a body I refused to 
love.

But even when my experience was easier to 

talk about, it didn’t feel worth writing about. 
I considered discussing eating disorders on 
the YouTube channel I had at the time or 
working my experiences into open-ended 
school assignments involving writing. But 
when I tried to do any research, it upset me 
and I wanted to distance myself from the topic 
completely.

Getting over my ruinous relationship with 

food did not bring my passion for writing back. 

It left an empty space, and my brain was not 
accustomed to feeling joy from an activity 
other than eating after starving. My art 
became strictly scheduled. I finished a draft 
of a novel, a thousand and then five hundred 
words at a time, over the course of the summer. 
I didn’t know if I cared about the novel — I still 
don’t — but I enjoyed some of the writing.

Getting into descriptions brought me joy. 

I never wrote more than I had to, never kept 
going because I was enveloped by a scene. 
I worried about the fact that if I didn’t force 
myself to do the things I claimed to love, I would 
not do them out of my own desire. The constant 

anxious tension that came with disordered 
eating had left, but nothing had taken its place.

A few nights ago, I was having a good 

night. My work was done, and I gave myself 
permission to relax and do nothing at all for 
the next few hours before I went to bed. I 
considered watching a show or reading a book, 
but I was itching for something else, and I 
knew that wouldn’t be satisfying. I wanted to 
do something, something of my own. I wanted 
to create something and put it out into the 
world instead of just taking things in. 

I’ll admit— if Nicolas Cage cooked a meal 

for me, I’d be a little weirded out, but I’d still 
be flattered. Yet that’s exactly what he does 
in Michael Sarnoski’s debut film “Pig.” The 
premise is refreshingly odd. Reclusive truffle-
hunter Rob Feld (Cage, “Willy’s Wonderland”) 
has his beloved truffle-hunting pig stolen, 
and he embarks on a journey into his past life 
to get it back. The film is an inversion of the 
classic revenge story: Think “John Wick,” but 
instead of the protagonist brutally murdering 
his animal-abusing enemies, he shows them 
empathy and compassion through the act of 
cooking. In this film about grief and loss, food 
takes center stage.

Human emotion and food are inextricable 

from one another in “Pig.” Prior to retreating 
into the Oregon wilderness, Feld was a 
world-renowned chef, revered for his ability 
to cook soul-piercing meals. However, after 
the death of his wife, Feld became a recluse. 

Nevertheless, food remains his love language, 
a language made more potent by the tragedies 
he’s suffered. And what language is more 
savory than a lovingly prepared meal? 

The act of cooking for another human being 

is inherently selfless, and there’s a certain 
vulnerability that comes with cooking: You’re 
offering up your own labor to be enjoyed, 
or critiqued, by others. There’s always that 
tortuous moment when you’re waiting with 
bated breath as your diner takes their first 
bite. Do you like it? Is it okay? Do you want 
more? Does it need more seasoning? These are 
questions you need the answers to, but don’t 
dare to ask.

Cooking is more than an act of vulnerability, 

though; it’s an undertaking steeped in 
empathy. How can you prepare a meal without 
taking into consideration the needs of the 
person you’re serving? How much avocado 
should I use? Should I poach or scramble these 
eggs? Is this too much oregano? Queries with 
no purpose beyond the enjoyment of the guest.

Throughout “Pig,” Feld capitalizes on 

food’s capacity to foster human connection, 

and he uses his past as a chef to tease out 
others’ dearest emotions. When the wealthy 
businessman Darius (Adam Arkin, “Sons 
of Anarchy”), who orchestrated the theft of 
Feld’s pig, refuses to release it, Feld doesn’t 
retaliate. Instead, he prepares a meal he had 
served Darius and his now-comatose wife 
years earlier. Previously, the meal (pigeon with 
foraged wild mushrooms and huckleberries, 
for those wondering) had a profound impact on 
Darius, essentially revitalizing his marriage. 
Now, Feld has cooked it again and sits down 
with Darius to enjoy it. You know that scene 
in “Ratatouille” where Remy’s dish launches 
the antagonistic food critic into a series of fond 
childhood flashbacks? This was basically that 
scene, with food being the warmth that thaws 
the frozen heart.

Comparisons to “Ratatouille” aside, this 

scene in “Pig” prods at a fundamental truth: 
Sharing a meal with another person is a deeply 
intimate event. Once you finally take your 
place at the table beside those you’ve served, 
there’s a shared experience, the millions of 
tastebuds of each person lighting up in unison.

I have this habit of being acutely aware of 

the finite amount of time I have with those 
I love. Every so often, I’ll get this feeling, 
almost like a premonition: “Good god, I’m 
going to miss this so much.” As a result, I tend 
to mourn the absence of these “good times” 
before they’ve actually passed. It heightens my 

appreciation for the present moment: I clutch 
these memories-to-be more tightly, love those 
around me more deeply and hold them closer 
to my heart. This is how I’ve come to feel about 
the nightly dinners my housemates and I have. 

Homemade ice cream is the 

center of my life. Since starting my 
summer job at a tiny family-owned 
shop four years ago, homemade 
ice cream has become my source 
of peace. It grounds me and calms 
me in any place and any situation. 
When I travel, the first place I hit is 
the destination’s signature ice cream 
shop. Local ice cream stores, with 
their homey air of familiarity, can 
be serene. But the stores are also 
exciting, immersing customers into 
the culture of their community with 
friendly scoopers, uniquely local 
flavors and close neighborhood ties. 

In my first month at the University 

of Michigan, ice cream from Ann 
Arbor’s local and family-owned 
shops kept me sane. 

On my first night of college, I 

headed straight to Blank 
Slate 
Creamery. 
Being 

there reminded me of why 
I chose the University. It 
was loud and teeming with 
young people, as much of 
Ann Arbor is, but the warm 
aroma of waffle cones, 
cookies 
and 
brownies 

surrounded me like a warm 
hug. 
Cute 
chalkboards 

covered in the writing 
of friendly patrons and 
servers covered the shop. Flavors 
like Apple Cinnamon Crisp invited 
me into my first midwestern fall, 
while Wolverine Tracks reminded 
me of the overwhelming spirit of 
Ann Arbor. Browned Butter Cookie 
Dough was so rich and comforting 
that I (almost) saved some for 
the 
impending 
first-day-of-class 

breakdown. 

University alumn Janice Sigler, 

along with son Nate Nuttle and 
husband 
Jerry 
Sigler, 
opened 

Blank Slate, an all-natural and all-
homemade ice cream store, in 2014. 
Since then, the family has become 
an invaluable member of the Ann 
Arbor small business community 

and invaluable to the life of many 
students and local regulars. In their 
eight years, the family has grown 
closer to one another and stayed true 
to Ann Arbor.

“It’s been eight years, and I’m 

still kind of dumbfounded by the 
opportunity that the community has 
given us … but also by the opportunity 
I was given by my own family, having 
built this place,” said Nuttle, Blank 
Slate’s operations manager, in an 
interview with The Daily.

The 
family 
sources 
local 

ingredients ranging from RoosRoast 
coffee, to HOMES Brewery beer, to 
Frog Holler produce and Guernsey 
Farms Dairy. Through their focus 
on community, Blank Slate uplifts 
fellow local businesses. 

“We get to share each other’s 

customers,” Nuttle noted. “When we 
worked with HOMES Brewery, that 
was a big partnership for us, because 
people who go to HOMES might not 

go to Blank Slate, and people who go 
to Blank Slate might not know about 
HOMES yet.” 

On the third night of Welcome 

Week, I walked the literal and 
figurative “lonely road” of State 
Street to my current campus favorite: 
Michigan 
Creamery. 
Michigan 

Creamery reminded me so much of 
my workplace that I almost called 
my boss (largely because I wanted 
to steal their creative flavors for 
next summer). It has the perfect 
diner feel, with bright blue walls, 
fun colorful lighting, a mural of Ann 
Arbor and just about every ice cream 
and chocolate treat imaginable. As 
I dug into my Detroit Grand Slam 

ice cream (salted caramel espresso 
swirl with espresso chocolate flakes), 
heaped with hot fudge, I worried 
that I’d feel painfully nostalgic for my 
classic American summers. Instead, 
I felt content.

While employees do not make the 

ice cream or chocolates on-site, they 
locally source all products.

“All of our products are Michigan 

made,” owner and manager Sarah 
Seta proudly emphasized in an 
interview with The Daily. 

The sense of artisanship and 

Michigan loyalty permeates the 
store, which Sarah and Jim Seta 
opened on State Street in 2012. 
They provide treats, discounts and 
funding for local schools, churches 
and nonprofits while employing 
many 
University 
students 
and 

serving students stumbling down 
State Street into the late night. Their 
stunning display of Alpine Chocolat 
Haus artisan chocolates and lineup 

of coffee treats from local 
favorite Bearclaw Coffee 
has customers wondering 
if two desserts are too 
much (it never is). 

“Everyone 
that 

we deal with are also 
family-owned 
local 

businesses. So we relate 
to the way they run their 
businesses,” Seta said. 
“And their products are 
exceptional.”

If you say you like ice cream, every 

local will steer you to Washtenaw 
Dairy. As I sat down to write this 
article, I realized I had never visited. 
But as soon as I walked in, I never 
wanted to leave. In the best possible 
way, it feels like somewhere a 
grandparent would take you on a hot 
summer day. Vintage posters cover 
the dark wood-paneled walls. Next 
to the rows of Stroh’s homemade ice 
cream (a Detroit classic) and lines of 
fresh donuts and coffee, is the perfect 
little town store, with dairy products, 
wine and beer (in kegs too!)

You’re 
standing 
before 
your 

stovetop, spatula in hand as the oil 
begins to heat up in your pan, the sun 
already setting and casting a shadow 
of the clock tower across from your 
kitchen window. Your stomach and 
the burner growl in anticipation as 
you scroll through your playlists, 
looking for the perfect song to start 
your cooking: one hand clutching a 
bowl of ingredients just inches away, 
ready to be stir-fried, the other hand 
hovering above your phone screen, 
deciding 
between 
the 
melodic 

gems of Brazilian Samba or Spanish 
Bolero.

Yes, the dinner playlist — it 

certainly necessitates such delicate 
attention. It’s much like the indecisive 
shower-goer 
moments 
before 

stepping into the heat of the bath, 
one foot dry, one foot wet, frantically 
making their mind up on what songs 
might fill their eight-minute scrub. 
The 
dinner 
playlist 
(otherwise 

known as the cooking playlist, or 
songs to fry to, slice-n-dice tunes, the 
chef’s curation, a “vin et fromage” 
soundtrack, if you will) differs from 
a selection of shower melodies in 
that it isn’t a simple block of sound 
to fill a space of time with but rather 
a deliberate curation of music that 
builds upon and improves a mood or 
a feeling. 

The division of time in the creation 

of a dinner vibe, the ambiance and 
the adherence to an established 
aesthetic (Italian food necessitates 
not just pasta but Dean Martin’s 
“That’s Amore,” of course) all point 
to an effort to fit pieces together into 
a feeling. From the taste of cast-iron-
crisped rosemary focaccia to the 
music filling the incursion from start 
to finish in accordance with a style. As 
we curate a playlist of all our favorite 
hits, an image forms of what we want 
our 7-9 p.m. attempts at the culinary 
arts to look and feel like. Music is the 
dancer that accompanies us in our 
deep-seated need to romanticize, to 
aestheticize, to create excitement in 
the mundane. 

Cooking, 
and 
by 
extension 

“dinner,” is a start-to-finish journey, 
a commitment. First, there’s the 
careful selection of a recipe from your 
TikTok recipe favorites or, perhaps, 
your YouTube channel “Binging 
with Babish” video bookmarks. Then, 
you take to purchasing ingredients 
days in advance from a corner store 
farmer’s market or the endless aisles 
of a supermarket. Finally, comes 
the mental preparation, the actual 
preparation and the ceremonious 
start, the waiting, the checking, the 
re-checking, the plating and then 
sitting down with the end product: 
dinner.

What better way to spend time 

agonizing over the perfect sear on 
a steak or the rising of a levain bread 
than with the faithful sounds of the 
music that has accompanied us in 
every comfort, discomfort and those 
moments in between in our lives?

Maybe, you’re listening to the 

folk of Nick Drake’s “Pink Moon” or 
the soul on Marvin Gaye’s “What’s 
Going On” on repeat while eating stale 
crackers and cheese because you’re 
trying to get closer to home than you’d 
ever thought possible.

Maybe it’s The Beatles, Bob Dylan, 

Hendrix, The Velvet Underground, 
Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Wonder and 
Elton John — the music your father 
played set to the ill attempts at cooking 
he too employed in his dinner nights 
for you as a kid.

Maybe you instead require the 

up-beat tunes your mom included 
alongside her culinary endeavors, 
with Diana Ross, Janet Jackson, 
Madonna, Phil Collins and Bowie. 
Maybe you’re even a culinary prodigy, 
and Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” plays 
as you compose your symphony of 
eclectic plating decisions — complete 
with an internal monologue worthy 
of a Chef’s Table voiceover narrating 
your life’s work.

Or maybe the dinner is instead just 

a blank canvas for your body’s beat, 
and to fill that is the dance tunes of 
House or Techno, pop like Dua Lipa 
or Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, 
Rina Sawayama or songwriters with 
screamable melodies: Rodrigo, Eilish, 
The Weekend, a music video for 

whatever recipe pops to mind at 7:45 
p.m. Maybe classics like Patti Smith, 
Elliot Smith, Joni Mitchell and PJ 
Harvey set the singer-songwriter 
stage for a night you wish was rainy, 
ending with a warm pan shakshuka 
with flatbread.

Whether we like to admit it or 

not, the music we choose to play says 
something about ourselves, just as the 
food we decide to cook does.

In a restaurant, selection is an 

ill-afforded luxury. Although menu 
items come aplenty, your options are 
limited to just that: choices on paper. 
The food comes cooked by another’s 
attention, wine or beer poured by 
somebody else’s steady hand. And 
the music is carefully curated by the 
Top 40 hits on Spotify the manager 
has been getting really into ever since 
they discovered the term “boomer,” 
and realized that it can indeed be 
applied to 32-year-olds. But in our 
own kitchens and our own dining 
tables, music is chosen by us, as is the 
food we decide to serve.

Maybe 
your 
soundtrack 
of 

choice is none at all. You opt for 
silence 
because 
the 
auditory 

pleasures of food cooking mere 
inches away from your ears is 
certainly enough to fill the silence 
of the evening. Some might call you 
weird, but you know in your heart 
of hearts the sizzling of onions in 
a pan preparing for your signature 
roasted garlic pasta sauce brings 
just as much joy as the sizzling of 
Doja Cat on a heartbroken trap 
beat. The dinnertime playlist is 
not for you, then. But no matter, 
because you appreciate the beauty 
of the mundane, this everyday 
shakedown of routine into a 
masterful seduction of flavors and 
tastes and spices and textures.

Dinner is hard, making it is hard 

and no matter how hard we try to 
decorate the time with artsy plating, 
Instagram-worthy setups and the 
music we listen to, it does get quite 
boring. We get restless, tired and 
exhausted from the whims of our 
lives.

There lies a certain tension that 

comes with rekindling a return to 
in-person learning after nearly a 
year and a half of screens and stone-
cold breakout rooms. Tension over 
catching the right bus and finding 
the right class and showing up not 
too late and not too early and finding 
the quintessential sweet spot in every 
lecture hall and even the best, most 
private places to cry because to cry is to 
be human. And where do we go when 
things get to be too much and too fast? 
Where do we seek refuge and comfort 

and, mostly, predictability in a world 
that is anything but predictable? 
Where do we find the most perfect 
clean-cut lines and palatable sweet 
things that make us feel not too much 
and not too little? 

We first start with finding it all in 

Emily Mariko.

Most TikTok “For You” pages have 

been bustling with the classic salmon, 
rice, Japanese mayonnaise, sriracha, 
avocado and seaweed bowl that found 
itself skyrocketed into mainstream 
popularity through lifestyle vlogger 
Emily Mariko. At first, there wasn’t 
very much to like about Emily Mariko, 
because who cuts their vegetables 
that close to the screen and why is 
she leaning down that low in the 
frame to butter a slice of toast and 
microwaving her rice with an ice 
cube and how does she manage to 
cut her peaches and pears and onions 
just right without one ounce of mess. 
It simply isn’t natural. Her counters 
are sparkling clean and she doesn’t 
just shove groceries into the back of 
her fridge like the rest of us and hope 
they don’t rot. She even organizes her 

eggs by size and cuts her carrots in 
perfect little slices and stores them in 
mason jars of water and quarters her 
kale and fish in squeaky clean plastic 
bags and bins. And perhaps more 
than anything else, with women like 
Emily Mariko, and more so, with the 
inception and commodification of life 
as a means of capital — to share and 
sell aspects of living — there comes 
first dislike, then sullen bitterness 
derived from intimidation because to 
cut your farmer’s market bread loaves 
into neat little slices is to sometimes be 
grievously and shockingly threatened. 
Then soon after, there follows 
reconciliation, peace, a willful grace 
even, because Emily Mariko had 

mastered the most arduous, daunting, 
taunting burdens of life, the icky, 
sticky tasks we sometimes cannot 
bring ourselves to do, and there is joy 
in watching someone else accomplish 
them in the most refined, beautiful, 
polished way possible. 

We have been embroiled in a 

global pandemic for nearly a year 
and a half. I lost my aunt last week 
to the virus because it has not yet 
finished wreaking violent havoc. 
And the return to college is no 
different because it can quickly 
fray and fall apart as things pile up 
onto other things and other things, 
and even more so, at a school like 
the University of Michigan with 
the Leaders and the Best looming 
around every corner, it becomes 
even more difficult to convince 
ourselves that imperfection is okay, 
to sometimes reconcile with falling 
short and failure. And women like 
Emily Mariko help us put one foot in 
front of the other.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

11 Minuscule amount

22 Winter warm spell

31 Do a number, say

“Kim Kardashian West understood 

the 
assignment.” 
“Genius. 
Pure 

Brilliance. She swallowed them all.” 
“Iconic.” Top-line celebrities and fans 
used these words to describe what 
they thought of Kim Kardashian’s 
questionable outfit for the 2021 Met 
Gala. If you’re unfamiliar with her 
ensemble, allow me to paint you a 
picture: Kim wore black from head 
to toe, literally. Every inch of Kim’s 
body, including her face, was covered 
in a black Balenciaga T-shirt, with 
two long capes dragging feet behind 
her. In a sea of the glitz and glamour 
of the Met, Kim’s plain but entirely 
bold number stood out like no other. 
The deepness and darkness of her 
outfit contrasted with the bright and 
vibrant looks of the Met Gala like 
night and day — almost to the point 
that Kim’s outfit seemed bat-like and 
scary at first glance.

The theme of the Met was “In 

America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” 
an effort to highlight emerging 
American designers and “sentiment 
over practicality”. This left lots of 
ambiguity surrounding the meaning 
behind Kim’s outfit and how it fit into 
the theme of the event — what was so 
“American” about wearing something 
that seemed to represent nothing at 
all? Other celebrities paid tribute to 
historically iconic American figures: 
Kendall Jenner recreating Audrey 
Hepburn’s crystal gown look from 
“My Fair Lady” and Nikkie de Jager 
paying homage to American LGBTQ+ 
activist Marsha P. Johnson. Some 
contend that Kim’s outfit represented 
how she proved to be a recognizable 
figure despite being covered head to 
toe. Some thought that because Kim 
is so overly sexualized, her outfit was 
used as a point to prove that she can 
still be critiqued while being covered 
entirely. Whereas others, like me, 
concluded her outfit to have no 
significance to the theme at all.

As a Muslim woman who observes 

the 
hijab 
and 
has 
experienced 

firsthand 
discrimination 
for 

representing my faith, I find the 
response to Kim’s Met Gala ensemble 
to be awfully hypocritical. Kim’s 
outfit has sparked a large discussion, 
ranging from predictions for its 
“elaborate meaning” to praise for 
its “unique” and “original” nature. 
However, this conversation never 
included buzzwords like “oppressed” 
or “barbaric” the way buzzwords like 
these are presented when it comes 
to conversations regarding hijab. 
Naively, I thought Kim’s outfit would 
be regarded as a “miss.” Other than 
the fact that I felt as though it was 
simply ugly, I couldn’t wrap my mind 
around any sort of significance it 
could have possibly held. But could I 
say I was surprised when her praise 
began flooding my social media feed? 
No. After all, when Muslim women 
are covered, their practice is regarded 
as “third-worldly” and backwards. 
Kim’s outfit demonstrated that it is 
Muslim women, and Muslim women 
only, who face such bigotry. She 
was quite literally unable to see in 
her outfit, proving that when an 
A-list celebrity takes the practice 
to an even more extreme level, they 
are regarded as fashion icons. It 
screamed the double standard at play, 

and I couldn’t believe how explicit 
the hypocrisy made itself out to be. 
Why are you shocked? It’s always been 
this way. 

But my excessive reflections in 

trying to figure out where to channel 
my frustrations made me realize 
that my anger wasn’t aimed at Kim’s 
outfit — but rather the greater 
conversation of anti-Muslim bigotry. 
Kim Kardashian just happened to 
be the one to reiterate the societal 
hypocrisy that surrounds the hijab 
and other religious coverings. In 
reality, Muslim women, especially 
those who wear the hijab, have borne 
the greatest burden of anti-Muslim 
discrimination. 
Visibly 
Muslim 

women, such as those who wear 
the hijab, niqab or burka are at the 
frontlines of knowing what it feels 
like to be Muslim in the west. It means 
confronting 
daily 
discrimination, 

humiliation 
and 
the 
feeling 
of 

constant fear of what wearing a 
hijab in public could possibly lead 
to. It means waking up every day 
and actively making the decision to 
wear the hijab while knowing much 
too well that it sets you apart, and in 
the West, this distinction tends to be 
negative. 

In southern Vietnamese culture, it is 

common to refer to your siblings based on 
their birth order. The rankings start with 
“hai,” which means two, so the oldest sibling 
would be __ hai, preceded by either “chị,” 
meaning older sister, or “anh,” meaning older 
brother. To reference younger siblings, we use 
“em.” Translations for this piece: hai = two, tư 
= four, sáu = six, tám = eight. 

Step 1: It’s May 12, 1958, when you are 

born. You are the eighth child, with four 
older sisters and three older brothers. Your 
name is Nguyen Hoang Hung, son to a dad 
who is a teacher and a mom who stays at 
home but sometimes helps her brother-in-
law at his herbal store. You get along best 
with your older brother whom you call “anh 
tám,” since he’s the closest to you in age. 
By the time you are born, your eldest sister 
will already be 17, your second eldest sister 
will have died when she was eight or nine 
and your eldest brother will have passed 
away when he was young, but you won’t 
remember specifics because you weren’t 
even born yet.

Step 2: Your sister whom you call “chị tưư” 

takes you to the Christian elementary school 
every day, and you spend time after school 
playing with anh tám because there aren’t 
many neighborhood kids to play with. You 
enjoy playing with your dogs in the evening 
and sleeping in your mom’s bed at night.

Step 3: By the time you are 18, you start 

worrying about escaping your home country. 
Your anh sáu has already embarked on his 
journey before you, so now, you’re going 
alone. November 1980 is when you’ll have 
to try for the first time. At night, you make 
your way to a set location along with other 
hopeful citizens to be led by a person who 
will take you to the boat. No one will show 
up. You do not return home, so instead, you 
go to a farm in the Rạch Sỏi village, staying 
at the home of your parents’ acquaintances, 
where you go from a city boy to a farmer boy. 
You do what they do: fishing, planting rice 
and yard work.

Step 4: Across the next five months, you 

make five more unsuccessful attempts. 
After every failure or false call, you return 
to the farm, but you have to blend in, so you 
pick up smoking and drinking even though 
you despise it. 

Step 5: When April 1981 comes around, 

you leave for your sixth try but before you 
can make it to the boat, the police start 
chasing you and the others. It’s nighttime 
so it’s hard to see. You try to hide in a ditch, 
but it doesn’t work; an officer grabs you by 
the shirt and beats you and jabs you with the 
butt of their gun in the ribs and stomach — 
an experience so painful and traumatizing 
that you will still have nightmares about it 
when you are older and safe. 

Step 6: For about two months, you are 

in a labor camp. Your head is shaven. Little 
scabies start to take over your body, and 
it hurts to sit or sleep. Every night you eat 
cabbage soup which, too, traumatizes you 
to the point where, in the future, when your 
wife cooks it for dinner, you eat it only to 
make her happy. 

Step 7: You are let out of jail because there 

is not enough room for the new incoming 
prisoners. You go back to the farm until 
August of that year where you return 
home to your parents and anh tám because 
the rest of your siblings are on their own 
journeys. Your father knows a man who 
needs extra help at his pharmacy, so you go 
there to work. From 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., you are 
at the pharmacy — aside from lunch when 
you bike home and your father teaches 
you English as you eat. You sleep at the 
pharmacy, too, because your parents fear 
that you will be caught if you go out at night. 

Step 8: On April 27, 1982, you leave 

the pharmacy for your seventh, and 
finally successful, attempt. After staying 
at a set location until the night of the 
28th waiting for the boat, it comes and 
starts making its way deeper through 
the water. On the morning of May 1, you 
and 70 others go from the fishing boat 
onto a Norwegian ship carrying liquid 
natural gas. You are on the boat for six 
days before the boat comes to port at 
Chiba, Japan, on May 7, 1982. After going 
through the immigration office, you get 
on a bus for 24 hours that takes you to 
Nagasaki, where refugees tell officials 
what country they want to go to; they 
are then split off to different provinces 
accordingly. You choose America, so you 
stay for two weeks before heading to Seto 
City in Aichi Prefecture for the next two 
years in a refugee camp.

Altar: Finding beauty in loss

R&B 
singer 
Kehlani 
has 

experienced a great deal of loss 
and portrays their resulting grief in 
unconventional ways through music. 
In their latest single, “Altar,” they 
celebrate the impact and the lives of 
those who have passed, emphasizing 
that just because a loved one is gone, 
they don’t need to be forgotten.

This song feels incredibly personal 

because of my experience with loss. 
My aunt passed away almost six 
years ago and I still have a hard time 
coping with the fact she’s really gone. 
A picture of her and me remains on 
my lock screen just so I won’t forget 
what she looks like. My heart aches 
profoundly when I look back on the 
time I had with her. I think about 
everything I took for granted and 
the million different things I wish I 
could say to her and ask her. I wish 
that I could hug her again, see her 
smile and hear her infectious laugh 
in real-time. 

“Altar’s” upbeat tone, which 

challenges the somber tone that 
often comes with songs on grief, 
drives me to pay attention to the 
memories I have left of my aunt, 
rather than the heartbreak that 
remains. The song offers a sense of 
comfort and shows me that there 
is beauty in loss, so long as I grow 
to appreciate why I feel pain when 
thinking about her. “Altar” radiates 
warmth and happiness, expressing 
the power of grief and acceptance. 
It feels like a gleam of sunshine after 
days of seemingly endless darkness 
and storms. It reminds me that the 
reason why I’m still so insistent on 
keeping her memory fresh in my 
mind is that she taught me how to 
love so deeply. Instead of feeling 
regret from failing to enjoy the 
moments I shared with loved ones, 
this song challenges me to think 
about why I care so much about 
keeping them alive. 

Listening to “Altar,” or even 

thinking about its lyrics, challenges 
me to empathetically change how I 
perceive life without my aunt. People 

constantly say that loved ones who 
have passed are “gone, but never 
forgotten” and that they will live in 
our hearts forever. But I don’t think 
I truly understood what that meant 
until hearing this song’s lyrics. I try 
not to beat myself up over the fact 
that it is taking me so long to cope 
with her death, because as Kehlani 
so gracefully sang in her song, I’m 
keeping her alive, because I want to 
and I am able to. There is no reason 
for me to get over her death until, or 
if I ever feel the need to. The fact that 
a desire to keep her alive remains so 
strong almost six years later should 
empower me to keep going and 
honor her every day. 

My aunt’s passing still causes me 

pain. But being able to recognize, 
even for a second, that the reason 
why I may feel so much grief over 
her is that the love we shared for 
each other was profound when she 
was here, and remains just as strong 
today, is enough to get me through 
the day. 

“Altar” is not the first time that 

I have been pushed to view loss in 

a positive light, but I think that its 
message came at a time when I was 
finally ready to accept that grief 

doesn’t always have to be filled with 
shame and regret. “Altar” has aided 
my growth towards acceptance 

in ways I never thought possible. I 
am forever grateful to Kehlani for 
sharing this art. 

“Gossip 
Girl,” 
“Pretty 
Little 

Liars,” 
“Glee” 
and 
“Riverdale” 

are all TV shows that share 
two large similarities: They are 
incredibly popular and the main 
cast of teenagers is played by adults, 
sometimes 15 years older.

There are many technical reasons 

producers choose to hire actors 
much older than the character they 
play. For one, most teenagers and 
minors under 18 can only work 
under a highly restricted number of 
hours due to labor laws. Their time 
on set has to revolve around their 
schooling, rest and meals. Actors 
under 16 also need to have a guardian 
on set as they work. But despite these 
technicalities, it is hard to justify 
shows like “Riverdale,” where the 
average age gap disparity between 
actors and the roles they play is a 
solid 8.25.

It’s not the number of years that 

seems to be a problem, but more 
so the time frame selected. If a 
58-year-old actor plays a 50-year-old 
character, the harm that reaches the 
audience is significantly less than if a 
28-year-old adult plays a 16-year-old 

student, which also happens to be 
the age difference between Stacey 
Dash and her character Dionne 
Davenport in the renowned classic 

“Clueless.” This is because 10 years 
is a huge time difference when 
you’re younger. Most of us likely 
don’t change as much, physically 
or emotionally, when we go from 
50 to 60, but when we go from 
10 to 20, we may be practically a 
new person. Between the ages 10 
and 20, we change physically and 
mature emotionally. Most of us start 
this time frame at the beginning 
of middle school and end it in our 
college years. Think about how 

much we changed in this period. 
A lot of us have the majority of our 
“firsts” during this time — first job, 
first year of college, first time living 

independently and so on. When a 
15-year-old looks at the screen, at 
what they are “supposed” to look like 
according to the media’s latest beauty 
standards, they are comparing 
themselves to people, in some cases, 
nearly a decade older than they are. 
They are forced into reevaluating 
themselves because perhaps the 
small student in high school with 
a face full of hormonal acne feels 
they are supposed to look like a 
30-year-old professional model. It 

perpetuates unrealistic standards, 
dragging a bag full of insecurities 
along with it. Being a teenager is 
hard enough as it is; we don’t need 
an increase in unachievable beauty 
standards. 

It’s not all just unachievable 

physical standards. Quite often, 
shows that revolve around high 
school life have a large added element 
of romance or sexual relationships. 
It’s not completely accurate to say 
high school is devoid of all romantic 
associations, but for most of us, 
it’s nothing as over-sexualized as 
Riverdale. Often, older actors are 
hired because of how unethical it 
is to have minors play out sexually 
explicit content. But there seems to 
be a much bigger, overlying problem: 
If you can’t get actual teenagers to 
play out a teenage character, chances 
are that your character isn’t doing 
what normal teenagers do. Watching 
this kind of explicit content forces 
teens who have only just started to 
figure themselves out to mature at 
a rate that may be too fast for them, 
a process that deprives them of 
reflecting on who they really are and 
who they want to be in the future.

As my mother struggled to force 

open the door that had been sealed 
for months, dust blew through the 
air. The purple walls in the garage 
were no longer the pretty lavender 
I loved, but a gloomy gray from the 
layers of dust and faded memories. 
I turned to the right and looked for 
the white car my grandfather used 
to drive my brother and me in. I 
was met with empty space and a 
reminder that the car was sold. 

I’ve been in that car less than 

a handful of times. But when I 
was, those were some of the few 
moments I was able to spend with 
my grandfather. He’d drive us to 
the only mall in our small town — a 
mall that also functioned as a hotel, 
restaurant and playground. I’d run 
into the ice cream shop that only sold 
the wrapped cones that you could 
find at every store and grab one from 
their freezer, finishing it before my 
grandfather even had a chance to pay. 
Then we’d make our way up to a red 
booth in the top-floor restaurant, my 
favorite in all of India, and eat the 
same meal I get at every restaurant 
— naan and paneer. My brother and I 
would share the food and each order a 
different flavor of lassi and split. We’d 
be the only ones at the restaurant, 
which makes sense since I now realize 
the food was mediocre at best. But at 
the time, I thought the food was the 
best in town. The entire restaurant 
would smell like a mix of every spice, 
ironic since the food was bland.

The empty garage connects to 

my grandparent’s office. I stepped 
over the broken door frame that 
guarded the office and noticed the 
layer of gray dust coating my foot. 
The green walls looked the same as 
they did the last time I was there — 
untouched. After my grandfather 
passed, the office became a time 
capsule, opened only to enter and 
leave the building or as a room for 
my grandmother to speak with 
my grandfather’s old clients who 
kept coming to talk about their 
case files from years and years 
ago since he was their lawyer. The 
normally crowded room filled with 
loud clients from all over town 
was uncomfortably silent. When I 
entered, I hesitated before I looked 
up to see his empty chair and cleared 
desk — a desk that was normally 
covered in case files.

My brother and I would sneak 

around and peek into the office when 
my grandfather had clients over. We’d 
move the curtain that covered the 
dividing glass door and quietly laugh 
from the living room, joking about 
the clients who’d glare through the 
door. Then, if we were bold, we’d open 
the door and bolt into the office. We’d 
laugh or pretend there was something 
important to tell our grandfather, but 
we really just wanted to get a look at 
the clients and eavesdrop. 

The living room was the same 

shade as the garage. Pictures of all 
the grandchildren, our parents’ 
weddings and the Hindu gods 
my grandmother prays to every 
morning covered the wall. Splotches 
of water damage covered the top 
parts of the walls, and the previous 
paint job shined through them. 
I wasn’t allowed into part of the 
attached dining room and bathroom 
because the ceiling had collapsed 
there. The window behind the box 
TV was too small to let in a lot of 

light, and it was distorted so people 
couldn’t see inside and we couldn’t 
see outside. The window in the back 
blocked off any ounce of sunlight 
because my grandmother covered it 
with blankets for a reason I forgot to 
ask her about. But even with the dust 
and the damage and the covered 
windows, the room was still oddly 
bright from the nostalgia and joy 
that beamed from the pictures.

I would spend most of the time in 

my grandparent’s living room when 
I was at their house. My brother and 
I would lay on the cot and watch 
Harry Potter movie marathons all 
day with the air conditioning pointing 
directly at us on high so that when 
the power went out, the room would 
stay somewhat cold until the air 
returned two hours later. We would 
wait patiently for the power to come 
back and the minute it did, we would 
continue our marathon, never moving 
from the cot. Our grandmother would 
come and give us homemade dosas 
and chutney for dinner, and we’d 
scarf it down in the living room as the 
marathon played on. 

I walked past my grandfather’s 

locked bedroom — it sent a slight 
shiver through my body — and made 
my way to the bedroom my mother 
and aunt once shared. The red paint 
was peeling off the walls, and the 
only working light was the sunlight 
hitting the distorted windows. 
A few crows sat right outside the 
window cawing, breaking any 
silence in the room. The hot air 
burned my skin. The fan and air 
conditioner no longer worked. A 
sadness loomed over me when I saw 
the murals my brother and I painted 
as kids tattered from the aged paint. 
I took a breath in and was hit with 
the pungent smell of mothballs, 
a smell so familiar to me, yet, one 
that I hadn’t smelled in years. The 
windows were covered with my 
cousins’ paintings from when they 
were little, over 25 years ago, dull, 
but still intact. 

Whenever 
I 
visited 
my 

grandparent’s home in India, my 
entire family including my aunts and 
cousins would all sleep in this room. 
We’d watch TV and talk for hours. My 
grandmother would tell us her best 
stories as I played with my toys. She’d 
talk about my parents and my aunts 
and my uncles. She’d tell me about my 
cousins who were all much older than 
me, and the things they did when they 
were little. 

Just before leaving to go back to 

my aunt’s house (12 hours away by 
train), I went out onto the terrace. 
I was met with burning dry air, 
hotter than that from my mother’s 
room. The sun was beating onto 
the concrete, so every step I made 
burned my feet. The brightness 
blinded my eyes for a short second 
while I adjusted from being inside 
a room of darkness. The clothesline 
that we used to dry our clothes 
every few days had fallen and was 
laying on the ground. My toy scooter 
sat in the corner next to the fallen 
line, unusable, completely rusted 
and dusty. I looked to the side 
and saw the other entrance to my 
grandfather’s room. A large heavy 
silver lock held the door closed. I 
stared at it for a few minutes with 
a pit in my stomach as my mind 
went blank. The same emptiness 
in my head I felt years before at his 
funeral.

T

o any Korean, the word 
“nunchi” 
rings 
familiar 

bells. Its literal translation 

in English is “eye-measure” and 
can be likened to reading the room, 
but more specifically to gauging the 
sentiments and interests of another 
and then acting in accordance with 
Korean manners and customs. 

So, for example, a friend that 

heads out to the car to turn on the 
AC in the heat of the summer before 
others get in has “quick nunchi” 
because that person’s senses and 
intuition are ahead of the situation. 
For the youngest person seated at a 
dining table, nunchi is second nature 
because they wait respectfully until 
the elders begin to eat first. When 
my mom returns home at 8 a.m. from 
the gym, ready to take over the world 
and knock down anyone in her path, 
my nunchi urges me to get out of bed, 
open up the windows and match her 
energy before she throws me a dirty 
look. Admittedly, I heard the word 
used most often growing up when 
my mom reprimanded me for having 
“no nunchi.”

There is a Korean adage, “half of 

social life is nunchi,” and thus nunchi 
is instilled in children from a young age. 
But as a Korean growing up in America, 
I became bitter at my culture’s high 
esteem for nunchi. I called for family 
meetings where I demanded that we 
instead learn from the latter of my Asian 
American identity and value clear 
communication and conversation. To 
ask directly, “How are you today?” 
“How are you feeling?” “Is something 
wrong?” rather than chastise one 
another for not being a mind-reading 
telepathist. I was burdened by the 
miscommunication that arose from the 
emphasis on reading the room, and my 
mind felt tortured, always calculating 
whether I had missed a nuance from 
someone’s ambiguous glance. 

It turned out that I had missed 

the nuances of nunchi. The Korean 
drama series “Reply 1988” is set in 
South Korea in its progression into a 

socially, culturally and economically 
flourishing state. As I watched the 
beautiful, hilarious, heartwarming 
and tear-jerking story of five families 
sharing struggles, laughter, cries, 
intimate moments, kinship and 
love in a small alley in Seoul, my 
poor appetite for nunchi changed 
as I refined my palate to the deeper 
undertones behind the art. 

I often found myself in tears 

as nunchi wove tighter threads in 
relationships: One late night, when 
Lee Il-hwa falters and fails to muster 
her strength and ask her wealthier 
friend Mi-ran for support to pay her 
daughter’s school fees, she heads 
back home with tears in her eyes 
and her head hung in shame in her 
inability to support her daughter. 
Later that night, Mi-ran hands Il-hwa 
an unassuming bowl of corn; to her 
surprise, underneath it is an envelope 
containing money and a kind letter. In 
another episode, I watched the quiet 
and distant son of Ra Mi-ran sense 
his mother’s witty and charming 
persona disappear into the darkness 
of menopause despite his mother 
assuring him that nothing was wrong. 
In a gesture beyond his comfort, he 
plans a surprise wedding anniversary 
in the neighborhood for his parents, 
rekindling his mother’s spirit. 

Nunchi tugs on your heartstrings 

in ways direct communication and 
blatant requests cannot. Nunchi is 
the serendipitous act of kindness that 
depends on another’s quick senses, 
building kinship between families 
and communities. 

Euny Hong, Korean American 

journalist and author, writes that 
nunchi is more than quaint Korean 
customs in “The Power of Nunchi: 
The Korean Secret to Happiness 
and Success.” Nunchi is the secret 
behind Korea’s progression from one 
of the world’s poorest to now one of 
the richest and most technologically 
advanced nations. It fosters trust and 
connection in a way that opens doors 
in all areas of life — also explaining 
the unlikely modern rise of K-pop to 
the global stage.

The world of “Reply 1988” is an 

antithesis of American culture and 

values. In America, the individual 
comes before all else — even 
sometimes to a fault. We hear it 
today in the riotous cacophonies of 
anti-mask protests that fight for the 
individual’s choice to wear a mask 
and in anti-vaxxers’ dismissals of 
collective safety and well-being.

In the vast regions, cultures 

and backgrounds that constitute 
America, we have difficulty relating 
to and understanding people who 
seem to share different beliefs and 
values from ourselves, and cynicism 
about their intentions often stops us 
from trying. The recent devastation 
on women’s rights by Texas’ abortion 
law, in which other people forced 
decisions 
on 
women’s 
bodies, 

exemplifies this. 

But John Locke, one of the greatest 

advocates for individual rights and 
freedom, still affirmed that the 
equality of man demands obligation 
to mutual love and duties among 
men. In the “Second Treatise of Civil 
Government,” Locke quotes political 
theorist Richard Hooker: “It is no 
less their duty, to love others than 
themselves … If I cannot but wish 
to receive good … how should I look 
to have any part of my desire herein 
satisfied, unless myself by careful 
to satisfy the like desire?” This is an 
echo of the Golden Rule. 

In “Inventing Human Rights,” 

Lynn Hunt, UCLA professor of 
modern European history, argues 
that the concept of natural rights was 
born in history through empathy. 
As humans began to learn in the 
late 1700s that we were all in some 
way fundamentally alike, we began 
to empathize with one another and 
thus expanded natural rights to other 
groups of people. Empathy’s fists 
knocked down the walls of even the 
longest-held prejudices of the time: 
In 1791, Jews were granted equal 
rights by the French revolutionary 
government; in 1792, men without 
property were enfranchised; and in 
1794, slavery was abolished by the 
French government. 

T

he “Michigan difference” is 
not something that students 
from poor backgrounds and 

rural communities often get to truly 
experience — it seems like students 
who yearn for it the most are excluded. 
We go to orientation and hear group 
leaders and staff laud the University 
of Michigan. The University really 
likes to promote a familial feeling and 
an “everyone belongs here” schtick 
to new and prospective students. To 
be fair, this is something that a lot of 
students experience when they begin 
their educational journey here, but I, 
unfortunately, was not one of them.

I did not get to have a normal 

orientation. As a student from the 
rural Upper Peninsula who also went 
to an underperforming high school, I 
was sentenced to the Summer Bridge 
Program. Bridge is a two-and-a-half-
month-long 
orientation 
program 

where students such as myself take 
high-intensity classes in a short period 
of time. We were given talks about 
imposter syndrome and reminded 
that we belonged here. Ironically, the 
entire experience made it feel like we 
did not. While we were in Bridge, there 
was a similar program happening on 
campus — the Comprehensive Studies 
Program. It was much less intensive 
and the students got to pick the one 
class they wanted to take. So while 
most Bridge students were struggling 
to get all of their work done by 8 a.m. 
the next day, CSP students were 
coming back to their residence hall 

drunk from a night of partying. This 
was my first taste of the divisiveness of 
the University.

As freshman year started, I had 

a hard time making friends. I was 
placed in Mary Markley Residence 
Hall, in an all male hall. I was shy, 
and very gay, which made it hard 
to connect with anyone, even my 
roommate. 
I 
constantly 
heard 

whispers between my roommate and 
the other students in my residence 
hall questioning my sexuality and 
making 
uncomfortable 
remarks. 

“Do you think he’s gonna try and hit 
on you?” or “Has he tried to hit on 
you?” are questions I’ve overheard 
more than once. This was a very off-
putting experience for a gay student, 
especially after being told that college 
is more accepting. But, I digress. 

When I could not make friends in 

my residence hall, I tried clubs. I went 
to Festifall, explored the many tables 
and talked to a lot of people. I thought 
that surely I could find a student 
organization where I would fit in. I 
applied to seven different clubs ranging 
from art, music, business and sports, 
only to get rejections from all seven. I 
sadly spent my first semester alone.

Along with my loneliness, I 

struggled with a fear of missing out, 
or FOMO. I saw everyone around 
me living the college experience I 
desperately wanted, even other gay 
kids. I was constantly trying to figure 
out what was wrong with me — I was 
trying everything they told me to 
do. I left my door open, I tried to get 
into clubs, yet nothing worked. After 
a while, I realized the problem was 
most likely my background. 

When I have previously made 

the argument that poor kids are 
treated differently at University, 
I always heard the same rebuttal. 
People always say “How is someone 
going to look at you and know you 
are poor?” In reality, they probably 
will not be able to. You can argue 
that things such as the clothes you 
wear, the headphones you use or the 
organizations you are a part of can 
make you stand out, but that is not 
what I am getting at. When I applied 
to clubs, I had one thing specifically 
that kept getting me rejected: my 
lack of a resumé. Other kids were 
coming in from wealthy suburbs and 
excellent school districts — how was 
I supposed to compete? Some of these 
kids had all the opportunities they 
could want in life, while I was trying 
to survive with what I had. It felt like 
I was always going to be labeled as 
the poor kid from the UP that barely 
got into the University, rather than 
a valued student who has overcome 
adversity to make it here.

As much as I wanted to fit in and 

believe that I was meant to be here, it 
was hard to do so when I felt judgment 
from my peers at every turn. Whether 
it was because I was gay, or because I 
was poor, I have never been able to 
feel like I belong. A lot of people have 
asked why I did not look for support 
groups or clubs specifically for first-
generation college students. I already 
felt like an outsider, and to me and 
many other first-generation college 
students, we just want to fit in. We 
want to try to move away from and 
grow from our past, not have to keep 
living in it. 

W

hen Joe Biden was 
running 
to 
unseat 

former President Donald 

Trump, one of the main talking points 
during the race was that electing 
the former Vice President would 
return the United States to a level of 
democratic norms we had lost during 
the Trump Administration. Indeed, 
much of that has come to fruition — 
our current president has yet to incite 
an insurrection over false claims of 
voter fraud, for example. However, 
Biden has failed to adequately mend 
one of the most damaged parts of our 
democracy: a frequent, cordial and 
informative level of interaction with 
the free press. 

He is certainly an improvement 

from our previous administration. 
Outside of a few minor incidents, the 
notorious spat with CNN reporter 
Kaitlan Collins in June being one of 
them, Biden has afforded the press 
a level of civility that Americans 
were more or less used to before the 
Trump presidency. There has been 
no lambasting of the press as the 
“enemy of the people.” But being a 
nice guy, and giving the press corps 
the occasional presidential cookie, 
doesn’t mean Biden has handled the 
press well. My problem with Biden 
isn’t his civility toward the press, it’s 
his availability. Biden is averaging the 
fewest press conferences per month 
since Ronald Reagan. He constantly 
claims that he “isn’t allowed” to 
take off the cuff questions from the 
press. He does almost no sit-down 
interviews, and if there’s one thing for 
sure, you better not try to overcome 

his press wranglers. 

Biden’s wariness of the press isn’t 

just a partisan talking point — it’s 
a real issue. Sure, Republicans are 
overzealous in their baseless claims 
that Biden “has implied that handlers 
set the rules and determine when and 
where he’s allowed to take questions,” 
and the idea that he lacks the mental 
acuity to interact with the press was 
never founded on any sound footing. 
But, one could very well argue the 
current president does not appear to 
feel it’s a priority to answer questions 
from the press. The press corps 
represents the American people, and 
the American people deserve to hear 
from the leader of the free world in a 
non-scripted format. 

This 
September, 
Biden’s 

apprehensive 
media 
tendencies 

were exposed in a painfully obvious 
way. Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
was visiting the White House for a 
meeting in the Oval Office when the 
two had a brief appearance together 
in front of the media. After brief 
remarks, Johnson invited his fellow 
British reporters to ask questions. 
They did, and he promptly answered. 
One would expect Biden would 
reciprocate the offer to the American 
press, especially given the location, 
but this offer never came. He didn’t 
open the floor to American reporters, 
and his wranglers yelled so loudly 
that the one question he appeared to 
answer was indistinguishable. It was 
frustrating to see, and it made Biden 
look timid at an important moment.

The White House press corps 

formally issued a complaint to the 
White House about the matter. 
When a press corps feels so deprived 
of 
meaningful 
communication 

opportunities that they are filing 

complaints, it is doubtful that Biden 
has restored our presidential press 
relationship to an adequate level. This 
isn’t something that should be pushed 
aside. If those who are doing the 
questioning think it’s a real problem, 
it can no longer be cast aside simply as 
a partisan attack. 

I’ve long felt empathy for Biden 

with his communication abilities, 
especially given his history with 
stuttering. But all the crises his 
administration has gone through 
in the last few months, most of 
which he has been unwilling to 
answer tough questions about, are 
deeply concerning and bode poorly 
for the state of transparency in his 
administration. 

This 
behavior 
is 
mystifying 

politically, 
democratically 
and 

morally. One of the biggest attacks 
on his campaign, and now his 
presidency, has been that he doesn’t 
want to face the music. At this rate, he 
may prove that to be true. Republican 
talking heads couldn’t ask for him 
to fall in line any better. Perhaps it is 
time to ask ourselves if much of what 
Republicans are saying about Biden’s 
press interactions are less so a set 
of disingenuous talking points, and 
more of an unfortunate reality. 

I find Biden to be a strong speaker, 

and he has even been lauded in the 
past by right-wing networks for 
numerous speeches he gave as a 
candidate and as president. With 
policing talks breaking down, the 
deadline for raising the debt ceiling 
fast approaching and the Democratic 
Party infighting reaching a breaking 
point, the nation desperately needs 
its leader to raise his voice, and not 
just to the level he feels convenient or 
comfortable.

C

anada recently had elections! 
An odd idiosyncrasy of the 
Canadian political system is 

that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
(through the governor general) has the 
power to call elections whenever he 
sees fit. Trudeau called the elections 
in August, with an election day set for 
Sept. 20, in the hopes of securing a 
stable majority in Parliament to pass 
some of his more ambitious COVID-19 
recovery packages. 

Before the election, Trudeau was 

the head of a minority government, in 
which the largest party in Parliament 
is the governing party unless a 
coalition rises to supplant them. 
Opinion polling indicated that it was 
likely he would be able to obtain that 
majority in Parliament, so he called 
the snap election. In the end, after 
a drop off in polling for Trudeau’s 
party, the Liberal Party and a surge 
for the rival Conservative Party 
(Tories), the election ended with 
disappointment for most parties 
involved, as none of the major parties 
saw significant shifts. Even though 
we saw no dramatic wins or losses, 
there are still teachable moments 
for American political observers, as 
Canadian voters prioritized the same 
issues as American voters this cycle: 
COVID-19 and the economy.

If you are unfamiliar with 

Canadian politics or parliamentary 
systems, just imagine that by virtue 
of being the boss of the largest 
party in Congress, House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi became the head of 
government. The main parties in 
Canada that you have to know about 
are the ruling centre-left Liberal 
Party headed by incumbent Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau, the center-
right Conservatives headed by Erin 
O’Toole and the social-democratic 
New Democratic Party (NDP) headed 

by Jagmeet Singh — the first person of 
color to head a major Canadian party. 
Also in the mix, while not winning 
any seats this cycle, is the right-wing 
anti-coronavirus lockdown People’s 
Party of Canada (PPC). Other minor 
parties are the environmentalist 
Greens and the Quebec Separatist 
Bloc Quebecois, but these two are 
much less analogous to American 
parties and institutions. 

The first lesson from this election 

is that there is an upper limit on 
energizing the youth. Jagmeet Singh 
of the New Democrats ran a youth-
centered campaign. Singh, a turbaned 
Sikh with a west coast surfer accent 
and a hipster vibe, prioritized issues 
young people are supposedly in 
support of, such as taking decisive 
climate action. He was a constant 
presence on TikTok, and he even 
played Among Us on a stream with 
his American counterpart, U.S. Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. 
All that to only gain one seat in 
Parliament. It makes sense to at least 
partially center youth issues into the 
fun social democratic party, given 
that young people tend to be the 
most amenable to social democratic 
policies and Singh’s aesthetic. But the 
NDP did not do as well as they hoped, 
gaining only one seat to increase their 
total to 25 members of a 338-member 
Parliament. That is not to mention that 
even though they were successful at 
winning a plurality of voters in the 
18-35 range, they only beat out the 
Liberals by a few percentage points.

It wasn’t even that Singh did a bad 

job. According to recent polling, even 
after the loss, 82% of NDP voters want 
Singh to stay on as leader. Singh often 
polled as the most popular of the 
federal party leaders, but artificially 
limiting a movement to youth 
aesthetics is not a recipe for success. 
We know that the NDP can have 
electoral success because not even 
three elections ago, in 2011, they had 
more seats than the currently-ruling 

Liberals under leader Jack Layton. 
So we know the problem is not that 
Canadians detest left-wing policy. 
There are only a limited number of 
young people with a propensity for 
voting, and parties (or progressive 
wings of American parties) hoping 
to effect national change should not 
limit their policies or aesthetics to 
the young. Focusing on a group as 
uniformly distributed across the 
country as young people does not lend 
itself to electoral success. Focusing on 
turnout above all else, which is the 
trap many left of center organizations 
can fall into, has limited effectiveness 
as you scale this strategy up and out of 
the most progressive districts because 
even if you energize the youth into 
voting, there is no guarantee that they 
will vote for you.

The 
second 
message 
is 
for 

American 
conservatives. 
Parties 

without a shared narrative or a 
shared voice will inevitably fail. The 
Conservative Party’s leader. Erin 
O’Toole, an unassuming former 
member of the Canadian armed 
forces, adopted a strategy of extreme 
moderation for the conservatives. 
Pro-carbon tax, pro-choice and pro-
banning certain models of firearms, 
O’Toole did everything he could to 
seize on the center of the Canadian 
electorate. The fact that these are not 
traditional issues championed by the 
Tories did not go unnoticed by voters. 
Moderation will be seen as pandering 
when the Conservatives are perceived 
to have abandoned many of their 
signature issues in hope of securing 
the keys to the Prime Minister’s office.

This gamble failed, as you may 

be able to tell from my tone in 
the last paragraph, and caused a 
surge in parties to O’Toole’s right. 
Meandering down the middle of 
the road ultimately proved to be an 
ineffective way for the Conservatives 
to pick up stray votes. 

Two lessons about American politics

Anyone remotely interested in 

American politics has heard of “the 
deficit” at least once. The deficit is 
how much the United States govern-
ment’s annual expenses minus its 
revenue. Conservatives treat it as an 
ever-present threat, with every bit of 
spending bringing the nation closer 
to their imagined annihilation. But, 
in reality, many economists seem to 
agree that the deficit isn’t the big-
gest issue facing America, with the 
United States having other financial 
liabilities that could be an even big-
ger threat. So, if the deficit doesn’t 
show any serious risk of harming the 
United States, why do Republicans 
seem to care about it so much, and 
why do they only seem to talk about it 
when they’re not the ones in power? 
Well, that’s because Republicans 
don’t actually care about the deficit; 
it’s just another talking point they use 
to stop the government from getting 
anything done that doesn’t help them 
or the corporations that fill their 
pockets.

During the years of the Obama 

administration, Republicans couldn’t 
stop talking about the deficit and 
used it as an excuse to try to stop any-
thing that came through Congress 
that wasn’t put up by them. Things 
like school funding and welfare pro-

grams were shot down by Republi-
cans. But, oddly enough, as soon as 
the Trump administration began in 
2016, it was like every Republican 
in the United States forgot that the 
deficit ever existed. From 2016 to 
2020 government spending shot up, 
and even though Republicans held 
the presidency, House and Senate, it 
seemed like they never even brought 
up the deficit as a concern when they 
were raising the military budget, 
increasing police and border patrol 
funding or paying for expensive 
weekend getaways for the president.

The 
Trump 
administration 

was not the only time in history 
that Republicans have completely 
stopped caring about the deficit 
either. During both the George W. 
Bush and Reagan administrations, 
the national budget increased by over 
half a trillion dollars. While some 
would argue that the Bush admin-
istration was forced to spend that 
much due to the War in Afghanistan, 
documents show that the U.S. had 
no real strategy in Afghanistan and 
were essentially dumping money 
that the American taxpayer would 
never get back. Republicans have 
a long history of hypocrisy when it 
comes to the deficit and national bud-
get, and with the issue making some-
what of a resurgence during the first 
year of the Biden administration, it 

doesn’t seem as though they have any 
intentions of stopping.

While Republicans’ hypocrisy is 

obvious, how exactly has it harmed 
the United States? The first and most 
obvious example of this is the lack of 
any major health care reform hap-
pening in recent years, largely due to 
debt hawks in Congress shooting it 
down whenever it comes up. While 
Democrats themselves aren’t too 
great on this issue, the lack of health 
care reform in this country has 
caused prices to skyrocket, causing 
many people to be unable to afford 
health care, and many who can 
pay are still at mercy of the preda-
tory insurance industry — all of this 
because Republicans don’t see it as a 
reasonable sector to spend money on. 
Republicans’ debt-hawking has also 
been disastrous for the United States’ 
infrastructure, with roads and bridg-
es nationwide crumbling, the public 
school system favoring only those 
lucky enough to be born in certain 
zip codes and electric infrastructure 
barely holding on by a string in some 
parts of the country as many saw in 
Texas this last winter. Even though 
there is currently an infrastructure 
plan being pushed that could help 
solve a lot of this, Republicans and 
the few “Democrats” who agree 
with them are doing their best to stop 
it. But the one part of government 
spending that has never fallen under 
the ire of Republicans’ obsession with 

the deficit is the military. Whether 
it be sending us into a 20-year war 
based on a lie, setting up unnecessary 
military bases worldwide or getting 
involved in struggles that don’t con-
cern us, Republicans love spending 
money on the military. 

One could look at this and think 

that it’s just because Republicans 
just have an interest in keeping the 
United States safe, and while some 
surely do, it’s almost certain that 
some Republicans’ votes when it 
comes to increases in the military 
budget are affected by the money 
they get from lobbyists who repre-
sent military contractors or by their 
investments in those same contrac-
tors. While Democrats also take 
money from the same lobbyists and 
invest in the same military contrac-
tors, it is Republicans’ particular 
hypocrisy on this issue that shows a 
maliciousness that does not belong 
in American politics.

While no politicians are strangers 

to hypocrisy, Republicans’ duplic-
ity on the issue of national spending 
and the deficit has been especially 
damaging to the United States. It has 
caused infrastructure to crumble, 
health care to be largely inaccessible 
and military funding to skyrocket. 
While this has been disastrous for 
the working class, large corporations 
have only gained from it.

As the nation recovers from a 

medical and financial calamity, we 
are finally nearing a point of relative 
economic stability after a year of 
more than $5 trillion in spending to 
keep the economy afloat. But with 
Congress on the verge of passing a 
$3.5 trillion infrastructure bill we 
risk dealing a catastroph-
ic blow to an already frail 
financial system. Before 
we empty the country’s 
pocketbook and snatch 
funding from future pri-
orities, we desperately 
need to consider the con-
sequences of passing the 
largest spending bill in 
U.S. history.

With the U.S. national 

debt above $28.8 trillion 
and the country set to 
default on its obligations 
by mid-October if the 
debt ceiling isn’t raised, 
our near-term economic 
future is anything but 
certain. If Congress fails 
to reach a compromise 
and the nation defaults on its debt, 
we could be instantly plunged into 
another recession, with the poten-
tial loss of 6 million jobs. Even 
without the doomsday scenario of 
a default, we still risk an economic 
downturn from a rise in cases 
from the delta variant and other 
strains of the virus. As the world 
has painfully learned over the past 
18 months, failing to plan ahead has 
dire consequences, and maximiz-
ing our spending now could easily 
lead to a lack of funding for unfore-
seen crises in the future.

Although the $3.5 trillion figure 

on the infrastructure bill already 

seems immense, the even more 
concerning number is $24,000, the 
amount of spending in the proposal 
per U.S. taxpayer. The vague plans 
put forth by the Biden administra-
tion to increase the corporate tax 
rate by 7% and capital gains rate by 
19.6% would not only fail to raise 
enough revenue to cover the full 
cost of the bill but would greatly 
weaken American small busi-
nesses in the process. The cost of 

this spending would ultimately fall 
on middle-class taxpayers and the 
next generation of Americans, who 
will be burdened by two decades of 
reckless spending on both sides of 
the aisle.

Yet another major risk comes 

from inflation. After the $5 trillion 
injected into the economy dur-
ing the pandemic, the economy 
is dangerously overheated, with 
the August Consumer Price Index 
rose 5.3% year over year, making it 
increasingly likely inflation is here 
to stay. Since wages aren’t rising 
fast enough to meet ever-balloon-
ing prices, this increase is imposing 

a tremendous cost on the lower and 
middle classes. Since last year, the 
price of food has risen 3.7%, energy 
and utilities 25% and gasoline an 
astronomical 42.7%. Recklessly 
flooding the economy with another 
$3.5 trillion could prove devastat-
ing to families already struggling to 
pay their bills. 

Meanwhile, the $3.5 trillion 

price tag of the bill is composed of 
a hodgepodge of items that don’t 

fit the Merriam-Webster defini-
tion of “infrastructure,” giving 
the appearance that the bill was 
reverse-engineered from its eye-
catching cost. As opposed to the 
bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastruc-
ture bill passed by the Senate 
and set to be voted on in the U.S. 
House, the $3.5 trillion bill splurg-
es on many partisan priorities that 
don’t address the dire needs of our 
nation’s crumbling infrastructure. 
The $1.2 trillion bill offers once-in-
a-generation upgrades at a fraction 
of the price, with $110 billion for 
roads and bridges, $66 billion for 
railroads, $47 billion to address 

looming climate disasters and even 
$7.5 billion to make electric vehicle 
charging stations ubiquitous. This 
bill is not only a win for American 
workers, the environment and 
infrastructure but a victory for 
bipartisanship and unity. On the 
other hand, the $3.5 trillion bill 
includes partisan priorities such 
as universal preschool, free com-
munity college, expanded child 
care credits and an expansion of 

the Affordable Care Act. 
While all positive ideas 
in theory, these scarcely 
constitute imminent cri-
ses or “infrastructure” 
needs. In practice, this 
wish list of programs 
would bring more harm 
than benefit to America, 
boosting inflation and 
indebting 
the 
nation 

while fixing few signifi-
cant issues for everyday 
citizens.

In 
a 
time 
where 

America is more polar-
ized than ever and our 
lawmakers can’t seem 
to agree on anything, 
now is not the time to 
sow our increasing divi-

sion with a controversial plan that 
puts our economic future at risk. 
Instead, our lawmakers should 
follow the example of Sen. Joe 
Manchin, D-W.Va., who has called 
for a “strategic pause” in govern-
ment spending until our economy 
is healthy again. By opting instead 
to pass the bipartisan $1.2 trillion 
bill, we can find common ground 
and work together to rebuild our 
nation, proving that despite our 
differences, Americans are still 
capable of coming together to 
drive real progress. Let’s all hope 
that Congress makes the respon-
sible decision.

Content warning: sexual harass-

ment and assault

As 
a 
sexual 
harassment 

survivor, I am calling on the 
University of Michigan to enact 
policies preventing other students 
from experiencing the trauma that 
causes the pain I continue to feel 
today. As survivors, we deserve 
justice and the feeling of being safe 
on campus. 

Unfortunately, this is not the 

reality at this university. 

Those in power have allowed 

students like me to be harassed and 
assaulted by predators, and it’s time 
they are held accountable. Small 
changes made by the University 
are a hollow appeasement tactic 
and do not right the wrongs of the 
past.

For years, students have tried 

to 
report 
sexual 
harassment 

crimes to University leadership 
and have largely been ignored. 

Instead of hearing our 
complaints and acting 
to rectify the situation, 
the 
University’s 

bureaucracy 
and 

complacency 
have 

gotten in the way. 

As a result, thousands 

of 
students 
have 

fallen victim to sexual 
predators on campus. 
This has happened to 
me, my friends and 
many students before 
us. 
As 
I’m 
hearing 

more and more about 
the case against former 
athletic physician Dr. 
Robert 
Anderson, 
I 

realize this behavior 
has been allowed to go 
on for decades by the 
University.

The horrific crimes of Anderson 

went on for over 30 years and left 
more than 900 student-athletes 
reeling from trauma, pain and 
neglect. How could the University 
ignore over 900 student voices? 

The University knew the crimes 
of Anderson and did nothing to 
protect its students — it’s not doing 
enough today, even considering the 
settlement process.

Instead of standing up for what 

is right, the University continues to 
hide behind its flashy ratings and 
athletic programs. When will this 
stop? When will justice be granted 
to survivors like me, my friends 
and all of the victims of Anderson? 

Those 
responsible 

for 
protecting 

Anderson and other 
abusers on campus, as 
well as those dismissing 
their actions, need to 
be held accountable. 
The University needs to 
do more to change the 
culture of sexual assault 
on campus and address 
the root of the issue. 
What has been done 
is superficial, and still 
not enough. The actions 
taken by the University 
so far are too narrow 
and don’t do enough to 
protect students and 
support survivors.

As 
the 
Michigan 

Students 
Against 

Sexual 
Assault, 
we 

are working together to hold 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

leadership — and all those like 
it — who continue to enable 
predators on campus accountable. 
We are a group of students, 

survivors, friends and advocates in 
Michigan who formed a statewide 
organization to inform our peers 
about sexual assault on campus 
and hold universities that harbor 
sexual predators accountable.

We want students to be aware 

of what has happened and what 
is currently happening on their 
campuses. We want justice for the 
victims and those in authority to be 
held accountable for the suffering 
they have abetted. We, as students, 
have enough to worry about and 
shouldn’t have to be additionally 
concerned about being harassed 
or assaulted by a sports doctor or 
professor. 

Throughout the year, the MSASA 

will be holding demonstrations 
and protests on campus. We will 
pass out literature and call on 
the leaders in Michigan to put 
an end to this multi-generational 
catastrophe. We will do whatever it 
takes for the hypocrisy and pain to 
come to an end. 

To the University of Michigan: 

Enough is enough. 

Sitting down for dinner with my 

friend, a fellow anthropology major, 
we began discussing the topic of 
human evolution. All was amicable 
until we reached an impasse. The 
discussion of Neanderthals (Homo 
sapiens neanderthalensis) brought 
us into conflict over the correct 
pronunciation of the species name. 
My pronunciation was “Nee-and-
er-TAL” while his was “Nee-and-er-
THAL.” I pushed back, explaining 
how my pronunciation was correct 
given that it is how the scientific 
community refers to the hominin, 
but then realized my rebuttal was 
not based on the intent to educate. 
Correcting his pronunciation was 
more about pedantry and was plain 
rude. 

Overcorrecting 
a 
person’s 

speech not only neglects dialectical 
variation and those with solely 
written rather than oratorical 
knowledge, 
but 
it 
also 
goes 

against the purpose of linguistic 
interactions. The primary goal in 
social interaction is to be understood 
by fellow conversation participants. 
If that is accomplished, it should not 
matter what the exact phonetics 
and syntax of the speech are.

The syntax and lexicon used by 

an individual are often out of their 
control and due to upbringing and 
early socialization. An individual’s 
grammar develops quite young — 
with children learning a variety of 
complex sentence types at 2 — and 
is mostly fleshed out by the age of 7. 
With this in mind, it makes little sense 
to shame a person for utilizing certain 
grammatical constructions. It is quite 
literally out of their control most of 
the time. Yes, people may learn other 
forms of syntax and alter their speech 
accordingly. But that does not take 
away from the fact that no one should 
be shamed from speaking with a 
syntax they were raised to speak. 
Much of our linguistic style is out of 
our control. Rather than an assertion 
of intelligence, correcting minuscule 
aspects of someone’s style of speech 
is insolent.

An issue of centering whiteness 

exists within the American English 
education 
system 
that 
imbues 

negative bias toward speakers of 
non-white English dialects. Dialectal 
variation within a language is a 
common 
phenomenon 
among 

the languages of the world. One 
estimate claims English to have 
as many as 160 dialects. Still, the 
U.S. education system privileges 
the dialect of white people and 
casts all other dialects as incorrect 

forms of speech. African American 
Vernacular English is the dialect 
of English used by many African-
American communities and is often 
the target of linguistic stigmatization. 
Word constructions like “ain’t” 
and uses of the habitual “be,” as in 
“she be runnin’,” are trademarks of 
this dialect. Unfortunately, AAVE 
is often delegitimized as a proper 
form of English and dismissed as 
simply grammatically incorrect by 
language ideologues. AAVE has 
become associated with ignorance 
and illiteracy, both of which are faulty 
claims that don’t stand up against 
linguistic science. AAVE syntax 
and phonology are a valid form of 
language. Yet, these speakers are 
hyper-corrected and shamed. Claims 
that these speakers speak incorrectly 
have no scientific basis and are 
outright disrespectful. A difference 
in dialect is not a basis for linguistic 
pedantry. 

Another point to be made is that 

many people learn new words from 
reading rather than conversation 
and therefore have not heard the 
correct pronunciation. If one is 
not acquainted with the complex 
patterns 
of 
English 
phonology, 

knowledgeable of the International 
Phonetic Alphabet or have a person to 
consult, how can one accurately know 
a word’s pronunciation solely from 

print? Scrutinizing another person’s 
pronunciation delegitimizes those 
whose access to language and novel 
vocabulary remains sequestered to 
the literary. English orthography 
is notoriously convoluted. Without 
the help of sound, there is no way I 
personally would have discerned that 
words such as “wait” and “weight” 
are phonetically equivalent. Biting 
criticism of another’s diction is rude 
and disparages those who choose to 
increase their vocabulary through 
print sources. 

The point of language, when 

taking an anthropological viewpoint, 
is to be understood by others. If that 
goal is achieved, why does it matter 
what syntax or phonetics someone 
uses? Any attempt at imposing rigid 
linguistic prescriptivism on others 
has faulty scientific foundations 
and 
does 
not 
correlate 
with 

sociolinguistic data. It is illogical 
to assert that a pronunciation or 
grammar construction is the only 
valid language form that exists. 
Dialectal variation is an integral part 
of linguistic diversity and should 
be celebrated instead of shunned. 
Whether a person is a speaker 
of AAVE, “Standard English” or 
another dialect, all of those Englishes 
are worthy of respect. You’re not 
smarter for correcting someone’s 
speech. You’re just rude.

When the Michigan field hockey schedule 

was created, it was assumed this past 
weekend’s games against Northwestern and 
Louisville would be competitive. Following 
the release of the NFHCA coaches poll earlier 
last week though, it was revealed how much of 
a gauntlet it actually was; Northwestern just 
outside of the top five, and Louisville at No. 
3. With Michigan holding ground in the No. 2 
slot, it was the kind of weekend you’d expect 
from the NCAA tournament, not a series in 
early October.

The Wolverines didn’t back down from the 

challenge, however, and cemented their place 
in the highest caliber of Division I with a 2-1 
double overtime win over the No. 6 Wildcats 
on Friday and a 2-1 win over the Cardinals on 
Sunday to sweep the weekend.

Both games were close until the final 

buzzer, in contrast to the blowouts Michigan 
racked up in early season play. While the 
double 
overtime 
nail-biter 
against 
the 

Wildcats was the most visibly contested game, 
the Wolverines were equally pushed by the 
Cardinals, who erased an early 1-0 lead in the 
third quarter and kept the game tied up into 
late in the fourth, when a penalty corner shot 
off the stick of redshirt senior midfielder Halle 
O’Neill finally broke the stalemate.

“We were playing on heavy legs after 

Friday,” Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz 
said Sunday. “The girls played as hard as they 
would with a week’s rest though. I’m super 
proud of their grittiness.”

Entering the weekend, members of the 

team confessed that nerves had been high. 
After playing two highly ranked teams in 
then-first-ranked North Carolina and then-
eleventh-ranked Wake Forest to start the 
season, the majority of games since have been 
played against unranked opponents, allowing 
few opportunities to test their game-plan. 
Coming home from a close brush with No. 
18 Ohio State, Pankratz drilled the team on 
maintaining pace and keeping a cool head 
in high pressure situations, cognizant of the 
threat to their undefeated record poised by 

the aggressive offenses of Northwestern and 
Louisville. 

On Friday, the Wildcats gave Michigan the 

scare the Wolverines had been preparing for. 
For much of the game, Northwestern dictated 
the pace and put Michigan on their heels, 
becoming the first team this season to out-
shoot the Wolverines. As the second overtime 
period headed to its end and a shootout 
loomed, Michigan found another gear, ending 
the game on a walk-off penalty corner shot by 
sophomore midfielder Anouk Veen.

“We were definitely nervous going into the 

game,” Veen said. “Being able to shake that off 
and stand on our feet was huge.”

Building on the lessons learned against 

Northwestern, Michigan was able to match 
Louisville shot for shot, and ultimately finished 
with 10 shots to the Cardinals’ seven. While 
the game was hard fought, the Wolverines 
were much more in control of the game from 
buzzer to buzzer, pushing Louisville back at 
almost every surge. 

“We’ve been playing down to our opponents 

lately,” O’Neill sa id on Sunday. “This week we 
stepped up and played at the level we want to 
be playing at”

For several members of the team, what 

mattered most in the victories was the 
ability to stay calm despite the nerves. It was 
observable in the team’s play: from warm-
ups to the final buzzer, the team danced to 
the music coming over the speakers, laughed 
with each other and tried to keep the game 
in perspective. Both game winners came off 
corners given from lengthy video reviews, in 
which the team was able to huddle together 
and take a breath.

“The music is one of our inside jokes,” 

senior goalkeeper Anna Spieker said Friday. 
“It keeps up from freaking out and getting too 
in our heads.”

Spieker provided both a brick wall in the net 

for Michigan, finishing the weekend on a near 
perfect 12-for-14 save record, as well as acting 
as a source of spirit while on the field.

“When you see Anna dancing in the goal, 

it’s hard not to smile to yourself,” senior 
midfielder Kathryn Peterson said Sunday. 
“If she’s not panicked, we can’t be panicked 
either.”

Down two sets to one, Michigan 

volleyball needed a win to keep the 
match alive. 

As 
junior 
outside 
hitter 
May 

Pertofsky rose up to serve, the crowd 
went silent. The Minnesota defense 
responded, sending the ball back over 
the net, requiring sophomore libero 
Hannah Grant to do the splits to keep 
the rally alive. Sophomore setter 
Scottie 
Johnson 

set 
the 
ball, 

and 
sophomore 

outside hitter Jess 
Mruzik 
walked 

on air, delivering 
a vicious spike. 
The Gophers tried 
to track the ball 
down, but it hit off 
of the chest of the 
outside hitter, and 
the ball trickled 
to the score table. 
Point Michigan. 

The 

Wolverines 
took 

this 
momentum 

and 
knocked 

out No. 8 ranked 
Minnesota in five 
sets, their first 
match against a ranked opponent this 
season, and their first win against a top 
ten opponent since November of 2018. 

After Michigan took a commanding 

lead in the first set, the Gophers fought 
back to make it 2-1 going into the fourth 
set. The Wolverines knew they needed 
to win the next set if they had any 
chance of winning the match, so they 
kicked it into gear. 

“We got more kills. That was big,” 

Michigan coach Mark Rosen said. “We 

use the term ‘dig to kill.’ When we dig a 
ball, we got to turn that ball into a kill 
if we can. If we’re just putting the ball 
back in play, at this level in the Big Ten, 
they’re gonna get a kill, so you’ve got to 
be able to dig to kill, and I thought we 
did that really well.”

Michigan got a lot of help in the 

fourth set from players who typically 
aren’t relied upon to get kills. Junior 
middleback Jess Robinson started the 
set off with two block assists, including 
a solo block. Freshman middleback 
Jaque Boney followed Robinson up 

with three solo blocks. Even sophomore 
opposite hitter Kendall Murray got into 
the mix with a kill of her own.

“Once we get those middles involved 

and our setters, it’s almost impossible 
for blockers to pick up on things and 
defend us,” Mruzik said. “Our middles 
did a great job today. That’s something 
we’ve been working a lot on in practice 
and throughout the preseason, and 
the beginning of this season is getting 
those middles involved and making 

sure that their presence is known. Once 
they start going, it opens our whole 
offense.”

Although Mruzik heaped praise 

on her teammates, she was the one 
leading the charge in the fourth set that 
ultimately won the match. With six 
kills in the fourth set alone, including 
the match point, Mruzik put the team 
on her back and was the sparkplug for 
the Wolverines. 

Mruzik 
was 
dominant 
as 
she 

attacked the backline and the sidelines. 
But 
with 
Minnesota 
focused 
on 

preventing 
the 

easy 
kills 
and 

getting its blocks, 
holes opened up 
and Mruzik took 
advantage. 

“When 
we 

played 
them 

the first time, I 
went 
back 
and 

watched 
what 

happened in that 
match,” 
Mruzik 

said. 
“I 
picked 

out 
some 
spots 

that they weren’t 
necessarily 
picking up on so 
I really tried to 
highlight that in 
this match.” 

Added 
Rosen: 

“They just kept plugging away. I 
thought Jess Mruzik was great in that 
situation. Scottie was great in that 
situation, you know, just a lot of kids 
stepping up. We’re seeing some really 
good development with this team and 
character.”

The momentum the Wolverines 

gained in the fourth set was too much 
for the Gophers to handle as Michigan 
carried it over to the fifth set to win the 
match.

Sports
10 — Wednesday, October 13, 2021

BECCA MAHON/Daily 

Michigan junior middleback Jess Robinson keyed its big fourth set.

As the first overall pick of the 

2021 NHL draft, Owen Power faces 
high expectations each night he 
plays. In the No. 3 Michigan hockey 
team’s sweep of Lake Superior State 
last weekend, he delivered. 

The 
sophomore 
defenseman 

totaled one goal and four assists 
in the two-game series, leaving 
his mark in every facet of play and 
proving too much for the Lakers to 
handle all weekend long. 

“He’s taken another step this 

year obviously with his offense,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson said. 
“… He’s gained knowledge and some 
wisdom and he’s smarter with the 
puck.” 

On 
Friday’s 
season 
opener, 

Power recorded the first four-point 
performance of his collegiate career, 
netting a goal and three assists. 
From the blue line, he orchestrated 
the 
offensive 
onslaught 
that 

drowned Lake Superior State early, 
putting his talent on full display.

Power’s three assists set the tone 

early to help the Wolverines bust 
open a lead. The increased attention 
he attracts from the defense 
continually opened up scoring 
opportunities. 

That magnetic effect on opposing 

defenders was evident in his third 
assist of the night. As he controlled 
the puck in front of the left faceoff 
circle, all eyes were on him. After 
zipping a pass across the ice to 
sophomore 
forward 
Brendan 

Brisson, the defense struggled to 
recalibrate after placing such a 

heavy emphasis on Power, leaving 
sophomore forward Kent Johnson 
with space in front of the crease. 
Brisson fired the puck into the 
middle of the ice, and Johnson 
redirected it into the top-left corner 
of the goal. 

Later in the matchup, Power 

flexed his shooting strength and 
accuracy when he extended the 
Wolverines’ lead to 6-1. After 
receiving the puck from senior 
forward Nolan Moyle near the 
blue line, Power drifted to his right 
before propelling a wrist shot at the 
net. The wrist shot had the strength 
of a slap shot, deflecting off the 
goaltender’s blocker and floating 
into the net for the goal. 

“He’s really put in a lot of work 

between last year and the start of 
this year as far as driving the offense 
and creating offense,” Pearson said. 
“Not only from the offensive blue 
line or in the offensive zone but 
coming up the ice.” 

Power’s single assist on Saturday 

night barely scratched the surface 
on the influence he had over 
Michigan’s win. 

When facing the same team on 

back-to-back nights, it’s important 
to give teams new looks. Power 
did so early in the first period after 
gaining possession of the puck at his 
usual position near the blue line. 

Instead of initiating a pass 

sequence or firing at the net, Power 
skated at the goal with a burst of 
speed, shooting at goaltender Ethan 
Langenegger from close range. 
Caught off guard, Langenegger sold 
out to stop the shot, leaving the net 
wide open with the puck loose in 
front. Michigan failed to cash in on 

the opportunity, but Power’s antics 
had the defense off balance early. 

Later, six minutes into the game, 

Lake Superior State pressured 
on the Wolverines’ net. Power 
responded with his striking speed, 
dangling through the opposition 
and bringing the puck deep into 
the Michigan attack zone all by 
himself — singlehandedly flipping 
the game script from a Laker attack 
to Wolverine offense. 

“He’s 
really 
improved 
his 

skating,” Pearson said. “...Power’s 
got more power.”

Power’s game awareness and 

multi-dimensional skill set came 
through when Michigan needed 
it most in the third period. The 
Wolverines had just clawed back 
from a two goal deficit to tie the 
game, and Lake Superior State 
looked to take momentum back 
with a key penalty kill. A Laker 
skater interfered with Michigan’s 
fine-tuned power play passing and 
launched the puck for a clear.

Standing at the blue line, Power 

said no. 

He caught the puck out of the 

air and dropped it onto his stick. 
Instead of being forced to chase the 
puck down and lose crucial power 
play time, the Wolverines were 
in position and back in business. 
Shortly thereafter, Brisson launched 
his signature power-play one-timer 
into the net, giving Michigan a lead 
it wouldn’t relinquish. 

Power living up to his limitless 

potential will be key for the 
Wolverines 
moving 
forward. 

If he maintains his high-level 
performance, they’ll always be on 
the Power play.

Power takes the reins and leads 

Michigan to opening weekend sweep

After Saturday, the Wolverines’ refusal 

to flinch is more than just a mantra

The Michigan football team has a new identity, one where it doesn’t flinch in the face of adversity.

LINCOLN 
— 
When 
the 

Michigan football team took a 
double-digit lead into the fourth 
quarter at Wisconsin last week, 
the Wolverines’ sideline joined 
the party for the Badgers’ famed 
“Jump 
Around” 
tradition. 
It 

set the tone from an energy 
standpoint, and Michigan cruised 
to a 38-17 win thereafter.

Against Nebraska (3-4 overall, 

1-2 Big Ten) on Saturday night, 
the 
ninth-ranked 
Wolverines’ 

situation from a week ago was 
flipped on its head. Rather than 
winning big, they had just blown 
a double-digit lead in the third 
quarter.

This time, the momentum 

wasn’t 
on 
Michigan’s 
side. 

Memorial Stadium knew it. But 
as the stadium lights dimmed, 
replaced by a red glow and 
cell 
phones 
while 
ACDC’s 

“Thunderstruck” 
blared, 
the 

Wolverines (6-0, 3-0) once again 
partook in the dance party. Then 
they went out and made the key 
plays necessary to secure a crucial 
32-29 comeback win.

“Keep the same energy when 

you get punched in the mouth,” 
junior 
defensive 
tackle 
Mazi 

Smith said. “Everybody’s got a 
plan until you get punched in the 
mouth. But when we get punched, 
we’ve still got that plan. And 
there’s still another quarter to 
play.” 

Over the last two weeks, 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

has lauded his team for not 
flinching in the face of adversity. 
It’s become a team mantra of 
sorts. Players have picked up on 
it, too, as junior quarterback Cade 
McNamara, senior running back 
Hassan Haskins and fifth-year 
safety Brad Hawkins all alluded to 
it after the game.

Hawkins, in particular, has 

been around Michigan teams 
that have flinched in past years. 
But through the first five weeks 
of his final season, this year’s 
Wolverines had no reason to 
unravel. By Saturday night, they 
were the only Power Five team in 
the country that hadn’t trailed yet 
in 2021.

Until they weren’t.
After leading 13-0 at the half, 

Michigan was outscored 22-6 
during an underwhelming third 
quarter. That didn’t stop the 
Wolverines from dancing their 
way into the fourth quarter the 
same as last week, though.

“We didn’t flinch,” Hawkins 

said. 
“We 
stayed 
composed 

throughout the whole game. We 
knew adversity was going to hit. 
It hit, and we didn’t flinch. I love 
this team, I love this defense and 
I love that we’re fighters. We went 
out there, we fought today and we 
didn’t flinch.”

Added 
Harbaugh: 
“Not 
to 

flinch, that’s what I’m talking 
about — that kind of grit, that kind 
of determination not to be denied. 
Just staying after it until you make 
one more better, sensational, 
incredible play than they do.”

As Michigan’s defense struggled 

to stop Nebraska’s option offense, 

McNamara appeared especially 
unfazed. A game that began as a 
slugfest evolved into a shootout, 
and the junior quarterback was 
more than ready for it. He led a 
10-play, 91-yard touchdown drive 
to give the Wolverines’ another 
possession of breathing room after 
the Cornhuskers got on the board.

And when Michigan began 

trailing, McNamara spearheaded 
three consecutive scoring drives 
— a touchdown and two field 
goals — to help the Wolverines 
escape victorious. Through the 
bumpy second half, he overcame 
his first career interception and 
maintained the poise of a veteran 
rather than a quarterback making 
his second-ever start in front of 
opposing fans.

All told, McNamara completed 

22 of his 38 pass attempts for 
255 yards. What won’t show up 
in a box score, however, is the 
leadership he brought to the table.

“The way he’s seeing the field, 

just cold-blooded back there in 
the pocket,” Harbaugh said. “You 
know someone’s about to hit you 
and you’re still throwing it to the 
right spot. Not flinching, that says 
a lot.”

McNamara wasn’t the only 

Wolverine who didn’t flinch on 
Saturday night. In the process, 
Michigan showed it’s more than 
just talk. For proof, look no further 
than the sideline before the fourth 
quarter.

“That was a huge scenario for 

our team to be in,” McNamara 
said. “We’re not going to blow 
everyone out. This game showed 
a lot.”

SportsWednesday: Michigan just proved 

it can be a contender this season

Going into the season, 8-4 was a 

hopeful prediction for the Michigan 
football team’s record. Our own 
beat’s highest prediction was that. 
Washington, 
Wisconsin, Penn 
State and Ohio 
State smelled like 
instant 
losses. 

Michigan 
State 

and 
Indiana 

would push them, 
and winning both 
would be a sign of 
progress 
after 

losses last year.

This year was supposed to be a gap 

year — a year to let freshman phenom 
J.J. McCarthy mature and allow the 
new defense to settle in. But now, 6-0 
and ranked in the top 10, this season is 
no longer a bridge to a brighter future, 
it is an opportunity for the Wolverines 
to be disruptive and play at a national 
scale.

Two weeks ago against Rutgers, 

the defense held strong and kept 
the Scarlet Knights from turning 
the table after an abysmal offensive 
second half from the Wolverines. A 
week ago, Jim Harbaugh won his 
biggest road win at Michigan. This 
week, the offense kept the team in 
it even as the defense floundered. 
Then, when it needed to, the defense 
forced a late fumble to set up a game-
winning field goal.

“We didn’t flinch,” senior safety 

Brad Hawkins said. “We stayed 
composed throughout the whole 
game. We knew adversity was going 
to hit. It hit, and we didn’t flinch. I 
love this team, I love this defense, 
and I know we’re fighters.”

Michigan teams of the past 

couldn’t have done any of those 
things. 

This year, the dominoes are falling 

the right way for the Wolverines. 
When looking across college football, 

the traditionally top teams are 
struggling. Oklahoma has scraped 
by in five of its six games, Alabama 
lost to an unranked team, Clemson 
has plummeted out of even the top 
25. Notre Dame has looked ugly in 
its 5-1 start and now Penn State has 
a questionable quarterback situation 
due to Sean Clifford’s injury. 

There is actually a path to the 

College Football Playoff. Which 
is, inherently, a ridiculous thing to 
write. 

But Michigan still has to face its 

biggest tests. Michigan State, the 
Nittany Lions and Ohio State are all 
top 10 teams left on its schedule, and 
each of them is finding its identity 
(Clifford’s injury aside). 

If the Wolverines lose just 

two of those games, this could be 
Harbaugh’s best season ever at 
Michigan. If they lose one of those 
games, they would be contenders 
for the College Football Playoff and 

likely give Harbaugh his first Big Ten 
Title. 

And after the past three weeks, 

Michigan losing only one of those 
games isn’t a laughably absurd 
thought. Because unlike in previous 
years, the Wolverines have shown an 
ability to adjust and learn from their 
shortcomings.

The abysmal offense from Rutgers’ 

second half hasn’t reappeared, and 
that game remains the only one 
in which Michigan failed to score 
more than 30 points. McNamara has 
improved throughout the season, 
and despite a few missed throws on 
Saturday he played well. The defense 
has made in-game adjustments, 
repeatedly shutting down teams after 
their first drive. There’s no reason to 
suspect it won’t learn from Nebraska’s 
second half.

All that goes to show that this 

isn’t a gap year for Michigan — 
not because it’s biding its time for 

McCarthy to take the starting job but 
because it won’t accept a loss. That’s 
why the team danced despite being 
behind at the end of the third quarter 
and why they continued to respond. 

“The grit they have, the fight 

they have, the mindset of not being 
denied,” Harbaugh said. “The way 
they prepare and they have fun 

doing it. It’s in the eyes. Practice and 
games.”

Now, 8-4 would be a disappointing 

end. And Ohio State, Penn State 
and Michigan State are winnable 
games and the Las Vegas Bowl a let 
down. So forget the gap year, the 
Wolverines have crashed the playoff 
conversation.

Unlike past years, this team finds 
ways to win in tough environments

LINCOLN — For a moment, as Cade 

McNamara walked off the field late in 
the third quarter, 
it felt like the same 
old Michigan. 

The 
junior 

quarterback 
had just thrown 
his 
first 
career 

interception, and as 
a whole, the ninth-
ranked Wolverines 
were 
reeling. 

Moments 
before, 

they’d been sitting comfortably with 
a two-score advantage and a defense 
that effectively suffocated Nebraska’s 
dynamic offense. One throw and a 
two-point conversion later, it became a 
three-point Cornhuskers lead. 

The sudden momentum shift 

evoked memories of Jim Harbaugh-
coached teams of years past. Perhaps 
it reminded onlookers of Michigan’s 
2019 loss against Ohio State, when 
the Wolverines scored on their 
first drive, then surrendered a 
touchdown on the next possession 
and never led again. Or the 2017 
Outback Bowl, where a 16-point lead 
late in the third quarter devolved 
into a seven-point loss.

Let’s be frank — the Michigan of 

years past would have lost Saturday’s 
game at Memorial Stadium. The 
mistakes that allowed the Wolverines’ 
advantage to disappear would have 
compounded into more frustrations, 
more 
errors 
and, 
ultimately, 
a 

humiliating defeat snatched from the 
jaws of victory. 

But this isn’t the Michigan of years 

past. This team — which marched 
out of Lincoln with a 32-29 win over a 
much-improved Nebraska team — is 
different. The Wolverines of the last 
four years were almost extraordinary 
at finding ways to lose close games. 

This year’s team finds ways to win 

them. 

“I think overall that this team has 

decided to be different this year,” 
McNamara said. “And I think it’s 
not as much what you see football-
wise, it’s the atmosphere that we’ve 
created, and really the mindset that 

we’ve rebuilt this offseason, and I 
think it showed today.”

McNamara 
exemplified 
that 

bounce-back mentality. By no means 
was he extraordinary on Saturday 
— he missed several open receivers 
throughout the night and often 
delivered the ball too late for his 
receivers to do much with it. The 
interception itself was ugly, thrown 
straight to a Cornhuskers defender. 

But after that throw, McNamara 

and the entire offense kept its collective 
composure. The very next possession, 
Michigan manufactured a 10-play, 
75-yard touchdown drive to regain the 
lead. When the defense surrendered it 
moments later, the offense responded 
again with a field goal to tie the game 
(Nebraska would never lead again). 

During those drives, it never seemed 

as if McNamara was pressing. He still 

made mistakes, but rarely were those 
the product of mental lapses. On plays 
where his first read wasn’t open, he 
didn’t force the ball and instead opted 
to find his tight ends over the middle. 
He displayed the poise and calmness 
that any team — especially one that’s 
certain to be in close games moving 
forward — needs out of its quarterback. 

That’s something the Wolverines 

haven’t had recently. 

“I’ve always thought that that 

was one of the huge tests for any 

quarterback,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 

“After you throw an interception, 
do they have the ability on the next 
possession to drive the offense for 
points? Right there, in a nutshell, 
you can tell so much about any 
quarterback.”

As with everything new about 

Michigan’s team, those changes didn’t 
stop with one player. They were visible 
in the defense, which somehow pulled 
out two stops at the end after looking 
helpless for most of the second half. 
It permeated throughout the sideline, 
which exploded with energy during 
Memorial 
Stadium’s 
post-third 

quarter light show — despite trailing 
for the first time all season at that 
point. 

And most of all, it shows in the 

Wolverines’ record midway through 
the season: 6-0. Say what you want about 

the competition, the inconsistency, the 
dumb errors on the road; despite all of 
that, Michigan’s entering its bye week 
exceeding all expectations and on the 
cusp of potentially competing for a Big 
Ten Championship. 

Somehow, the Wolverines are 

winning games. They’ve chosen to 
abandon the status quo of the Harbaugh 
era and embrace a new identity. 

For McNamara, the motivations 

behind that choice are simple:

“We’re tired of losing.”

Less than two minutes after drilling the most 

important kick of his career, Jake Moody trotted onto 
the field. His next one would be even bigger.

That was how the final stretch of Saturday’s 

narrow win at Nebraska unfolded for the No. 8 
Michigan football team’s senior kicker. With the 
Wolverines trailing, 29-26, Moody’s 31-yard field goal 
tied the game with 3:05 to play. And after Michigan’s 
defense forced a critical turnover, Moody put the 
Wolverines on top for good with a 39-yard field goal as 
the clock ticked down to 1:28.

For Moody, Saturday night’s heroics are the latest 

example of his consistent success. He finished 4-for-
4 on field goals and 2-for-2 on extra-point attempts, 
earning 
Big 
Ten 
Special 

Teams Player of the Week 
honors in the process. He’s 
converted 12 of his 13 field goal 
tries — including a 52-yarder 
against Washington — this 
season 
while 
successfully 

knocking through all 25 extra 
points.

“Jake is a part of the 

offense. We can always 
count 
on 
Jake,” 
junior 

receiver 
Mike 
Sainristil 

said 
Monday. 
“Moody, 

he’s real cold, to do what 
he did on Saturday. As a 
player 
himself, 
having 

that confidence in those 
situations, I just love that 
from Moody.”

Similar to a baseball pitcher managing his arm, the 

Wolverines’ coaches keep Moody on a “kick count.” 
He kicks just three days per week — twice at practice 
and once during games — in order to maintain leg 
strength and longevity.

For the first three years of his career, Moody 

split time with fellow kicker Quinn Nordin. Moody 
struggled to establish rhythm after his freshman 
season, missing six of his 13 field goal attempts in 2019 
and 2020. But with Nordin now in the NFL, Moody 
can take comfort in knowing he’s the Wolverines’ 
clear No. 1 option.

“It feels good going into the games knowing it’s 

going to be you no matter what,” Moody said last 
Tuesday. “I enjoyed having Quinn around. It made 
both of us better for sure. But knowing it’s going to 
be you and you’re the guy for every single kick, it’s a 
pretty good feeling.”

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 

2020, Moody and Nordin were locked into a battle for 
starting kicker duties. A native of Northville, Mich., 
Moody returned home to train at his high school 
field. He posted a video of himself kicking a personal-
record 69-yard field goal in April and claims he made 
multiple kicks from 70-plus afterwards.

But last fall, that offseason work didn’t translate to 

results. Moody attempted four field goals during the 
pandemic-shortened season and missed three of them.

Through the first six weeks of this season, Moody 

has rebounded in a big way. Part of that comes from 
a new snap operation. Fifth-year senior punter Brad 
Robbins began receiving and holding junior William 
Wagner’s snaps during fall camp and the results have 
been encouraging.

“It’s been the confidence, the preparation,” 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said Saturday. “Brad 

Robbins is a huge part of it, not 
just because he’s the holder, 
but his mental fortitude and 
positive daily infusion on our 
entire team, especially that 
snap, hold, kick battery. … 
Moody is just a straight calm, 
cool, collected kind of guy.”

Now, Moody says he’s 

comfortable kicking from 
anywhere inside 60 yards 
in good conditions. Wind 
gets tricky across the Big 
Ten during football season, 
but 
Michigan’s 
special 

teams unit always takes the 
field early for warmups on 
game days to test out the 
weather. While on the road, 
Moody looks for gaps in the 

top of each stadium and takes note of any wind 
deflections within.

Rainfall and wind may be out of the Wolverines’ 

control, but those factors are closely monitored on 
game days. What never changes with the weather, 
however, is Moody’s visualization of success.

“I’ll be sitting up in bed, can’t fall asleep, just kind 

of thinking of those different scenarios,” Moody said. 
“Like kicking a game-winner in the Big House against 
Ohio State. Stuff like that. Going into every game, 
I like to think of different kicks. Could be a game-
winner, could be an extra point.

“I feel like once you visualize that kick in your 

head, once you get out there on the field, you feel a lot 
more comfortable since you’ve already kind of seen it 
through your head.”

On Saturday night in Lincoln, that dream of a 

game-winning kick became a reality.

LINCOLN — On Saturday night, deep 

into the third quarter and amidst a raucous 
sea of red, the Michigan football team 
found itself wading in unfamiliar territory. 

As 
Nebraska 
receiver 
Levi 
Falck 

waltzed down the sideline and into the 
endzone 
untouched, 
the 
Wolverines 

looked up to see themselves on the wrong 
side of the score. For the first time all year, 
in the season’s sixth game, they trailed. 

And yet, in the face of its first genuine 

bout of adversity, Michigan flashed an 
unshakable streak of resilience. Propelled 
by a last-minute field goal by senior kicker 
Jake Moody, the Wolverines (6-0 overall, 
3-0 Big Ten) escaped the hostile confines 
of Memorial Stadium with a victory, 
edging Nebraska (3-4, 1-2), 32-29. 

Moody’s kick, a 39-yard chip shot 

that split the uprights with 1:24 minutes 
to go, came off the heels of a pivotal 
sequence from an embattled defense that 
surrendered 29 second-half points yet 
embodied that resiliency. Quarterback 
Adrian Martinez coughed up the ball on 

a 3rd-and-1 rushing attempt when fifth-
year safety Brad Hawkins punched it 
free, setting up Michigan’s offense at the 
Cornhuskers’ 18-yard line. 

“The atmosphere, the environment, it 

just showed a lot of poise and moxie by 
our guys,” Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said after the game, a smile wrapping 
his face. “No doubt (the fans) wanted to 
storm the field, tear down the goalpost — 
not on our guys’ watch tonight. I’m proud 
of them.” 

Through the first half, it seemed as if 

the Wolverines wouldn’t need Moody’s 
heroics to secure a victory; a 13-0 halftime 
lead certainly had the makings of another 
blowout, the likes of which Michigan 
has certainly grown accustomed to. 
The defense held strong, flummoxing 
Martinez and the Cornhuskers’ patented 
rushing attack and, after slogging through 
the first quarter, the offense found its 
groove before Nebraska did. 

Yet across the third quarter, it looked 

as if the two teams had spent halftime 
swapping uniforms. 

Michigan’s 
defense, 
which 
has 

established itself as a consistent, reliable 
unit under first-year coordinator Mike 

Macdonald, wilted in short order. On the 
half’s opening possession, a coverage 
breakdown left tight end Austin Allen 
alone streaking down the middle of the 
field; Martinez would find him for a 
46-yard touchdown. 

The Wolverines countered, with junior 

quarterback Cade McNamara engineering 
a 91-yard touchdown drive, putting 
Michigan up 12 with 3:36 minutes left 
in the third quarter. But, less than three 
minutes later, they were staring down that 
very first deficit. 

Martinez found running back Rahmir 

Johnson wide open on a wheel route 
for a 41-yard touchdown pass to draw 
Nebraska within five. After a McNamara 
interception, 
Martinez 
capitalized 

immediately, finding Falck to put the 
Cornhuskers in front, 22-19. 

More 
than 
87,000 
upset-minded 

fans erupted into a tsunami of red; 
the imagination had been stirred a 
step closer towards reality. A marquee 
victory, absent from the first four years 
of the underwhelming Scott Frost era, 
was suddenly within Nebraska’s grasp. 
Michigan, seemingly overwhelmed and 
discombobulated, would be the casualty. 

That narrative never came to fruition. 
“We responded,” fifth-year senior Brad 

Hawkins said. “We didn’t flinch, like I 
said. We came prepared and we stayed 
composed. You can’t look up at the score. 
You’ve got to just keep playing football. 
That’s what we did.” 

No Power-5 team had lasted longer than 

Michigan did without facing a deficit. And 
yet, the Wolverines proved masterful at 
handling the adversity confronting them; 
undeterred by the buzz of the crowd and 
a lightshow between the third and fourth 
quarter, the players jumped and danced 
along, spilling onto the field. 

“When we get punched, we’ve still 

got that plan,” junior defensive tackle 
Mazi Smith said, explaining the team’s 
relentless positivity. 

Their off-field actions only resonate 

because their on-field response spoke 
volumes. Sophomore running back Blake 
Corum punctuated a 10-play, 75-yard 
drive with a 29-yard touchdown run, 
an emphatic answer by a unit that spent 
the first half sputtering. After Martinez 
again found the endzone for his fourth 
touchdown 
of 
the 
game, 
Michigan 

remained composed, driving down the 

field for a game-tying field goal with three 
minutes to play, setting the stage for the 
ensuing heroics. 

Even after the Moody field goal, 

Nebraska had a fighter’s chance; a 
25-yard pass placed the ball at midfield 
with a shade over a minute remaining. 
Once again, though, the Wolverines 
matched the occasion; when Martinez’s 
desperation, 4th-and-10 heave fell to the 
turf untouched, a hush fell over Memorial 
Stadium. 

Michigan had indeed survived, scars 

and all. 

“We’re 
enjoying 
the 
incredible,” 

Harbaugh 
said, 
his 
eyes 
lit 
with 

enthusiasm, that smile still unshakable. 
“That was awesome. It’ll be a happy flight, 
I can tell you that.” 

Then, standing at the corner of a 

cramped, makeshift media room deep 
inside Memorial Stadium, Harbaugh 
gestured to the back. He looked towards 
Michigan 
Athletic 
Director 
Warde 

Manuel, sitting in a chair, dressed in khakis 
and a blue Jordan-brand Michigan polo, 
vociferously nodding along in accordance. 

“It’ll be a happy flight, isn’t it?” 

Harbaugh said.

Wednesday, October 13, 2021 // The Statement — 2

Fever dreams and corporate schemes

The store was cold and dark with figures 

appearing out of the minimal light offered by 
the piercing fluorescent bulbs — a less than 
ideal situation for someone with no recollec-
tion of where they were. Or what they were 
doing there. Or how they got there in the 
first place. 

I frantically searched for signs of any-

thing that might answer any, if not all, of 
my questions. All I saw was a long, narrow 
hallway that seemed never-ending. The only 
image protruding out of the ongoing horizon 
was a faint neon sign that read “GROCERY.”

Figures. A minuscule supermarket. 
I looked to my left and then to my right. 

Five rows of metal shelves lined the edges of 
both sides. There appeared to be indistinct 
products organized in a tight, tidy fashion. 
Nothing was out of place, and each product 
was in perfect alignment with the next. The 
arrangement was ultra-functional, yet the 
sense of order felt militaristic.

I needed to know more. 
I began to walk down the aisle, one foot 

apprehensively placed in front of the next, 
directing my eyes to any image that caught 
my attention. As I began treading forward, 
the visuals surrounding me became pro-
gressively clearer. The once indistinguish-
able objects that sat on chilling, lifeless 
counters began morphing into unfamiliar 
products — ones that would not be in a stan-
dard grocery store.

The first thing I could identify was a 

seemingly endless supply of machinery, 
including a plethora of interchangeable 
parts. Each item resembled one another, 
with identical ridges and nooks. As I peered 
my head in closer to read the item descrip-
tion, the advertisement’s words jumped out 
at me: “Why buy multiple parts when you 
could have one that does it all? SAVE TIME 
AND MONEY! MAXIMIZE EFFICIEN-
CY!” 

Though I had seen similar marketing 

techniques before, this product’s plea for 
productivity and cost-effective shopping felt 
strangely out of the ordinary. Why did inter-
changeable parts — a staple invention of the 
industrial revolution — need to manipulate 
consumers into purchasing? 

I felt an unstoppable urge to continue 

moving forward. I didn’t see anyone behind 
me, yet I couldn’t ignore the feeling that peo-
ple were waiting for me to continue. I felt I 
had no choice but to proceed. 

As I kept moving forward, the light in 

the store grew marginally brighter, yet all 
the more piercing. Its power illuminated 
the advertised items, making it significantly 
easier for me to distinguish what they were. 
Yet as these products became clearer, they 
simultaneously grew more foreign and 
bizarre. 

The department began with a section 

of over-the-counter “study drugs,” phar-
maceuticals like Adderall, Vyvanse and 

Ritalin — medicine I was almost positive 
you needed a prescription for. Study drugs 
contorted into the store’s book department, 
filled it with “must-read” literature such as 
“Productivity for Dummies,” “The Grass 
Is Always Greener: How to Compete With 
Your Neighbor” and an unnecessary amount 
of text dedicated to the “pull yourselves up 
by the bootstraps” theory. The sales section 
offered “UNBEATABLE DEALS!” — dis-
counted prices of “The Communist Mani-
festo” and “Das Kapital,” both published 
and distributed by Amazon. Though these 
products were on sale, the inventory seemed 
virtually untouched, with dust collecting on 
the crevices of every copy. 

As I moved past the publication depart-

ment, I stumbled into a segment titled 
“Games and Gimmicks.” Right off the bat, 
the region was dominated by an inordinate 
amount of Monopoly boxes, offering all 
themes and variations imaginable. Strangely 
enough, it appeared that Monopoly was the 
only board game the store sold, besides a 
one-off row of Hungry Hungry Hippos. Go 
figure. 

Unlike the game section’s lack of diverse 

offerings, the gimmicks this mysterious 
store offered felt right out of a fever dream. 
Suddenly, I was surrounded by products I 
couldn’t have dreamt up on even the most 
outlandish of nights. 

Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand. A brand 

of lollipops known as Boot Lickers. Krys-
ten Sinema and Joe Manchin bobbleheads. 
Globalization Globes, levied by an export 
tax. Tortoiseshells with Mitch McConnell’s 
head. X Æ A-12 baby dolls. Apple products 
with expiration dates. A life-sized idol of Jor-
dan Belfort, with a voice box that declares 
“Sell me this pen” upon the pull of a string.

Where did these items come from? Who 

could’ve manufactured them? And bet-
ter yet, who’s actually purchasing them? I 
looked around with an eerie sense of amaze-
ment, racking my brain for answers. 

Suddenly, a ubiquitous female voice pro-

truded through the walls: “Please proceed 

forward to maximize customer experience.” 
I recognized the robotic, yet comforting 
feminine rhythm from somewhere, but I 
couldn’t put my finger on it. I looked to the 
top of the walls for speakers, evidence of 
familiarity, and realized the store’s sound 
system consisted of rows of Echo Dots — the 
all-encompassing voice was none other than 
Alexa. I listened dutifully, motivated by an 
unshakable sense of fear, and continued on 
through the shop floor.

Next came the health and food depart-

ments, kicked off by an abundance of Mark 
Zuckerberg-sponsored sunscreen, babyface 
anti-aging cream and Kardashian-endorsed 
diet pills. “LOSE WEIGHT FAST!” the 
bottles screamed out, leading me to question 
my body shape in a store devoid of critical 
onlookers. The supplements dwindled into 
top-shelf meats and produce. I marveled 
at the beauty of the shining kale, spinach 
and arugula, all supplied by Monsanto. The 
greens were regularly upkept by a mist-
ing sprinkler, set off every five minutes on 
the dot. The gorgeous array of vegetables 
was halted by the magnificence of wagyu 
beef and wild-caught salmon, all leading 
up to dry-aged ribeye garnished with gold 
flakes. I had never seen such stunning and 
nutritious food in one congregate area. 
Yet my amazement quickly dwindled as I 
read a small sign conveniently placed at the 
end of the section, preaching “PRODUCE 
AND MEATS RESERVED FOR THE 1% 
INCOME BRACKET. VIOLATORS WILL 
BE PROSECUTED.”

I let out a large sigh, characterized both 

by disgust and exhaustion, yet continued 
down the aisle hoping only to avoid trouble. 
Thank god I didn’t touch anything. The 
coldness of the store almost instantaneously 
morphed into a hot, desert-like climate, leav-
ing me begging for sustenance. Unfortu-
nately, the only products this area sold were 
White Castle’s cheeseburger sliders and 
Arby’s Roast Beef. 

I had to get out of here. I was uneasy, 

uncertain, uncomfortable and unwelcome. 

I no longer wanted to explore my surround-
ings — I needed to locate an exit. The only 
way through is through. I picked up my pace, 
catalyzing an unprovocative yet steady jog, 
desperate to find the end of the perpetual 
grocery store. 

As I ran without an end in sight, I shuffled 

by the “exclusive items” department. 

Stock options. Financial loopholes. Con-

gressional votes. Government access codes. 
Buy one, get one free TV networks. Jeff 
Bezos’ business blueprints. Donald Trump’s 
tax returns. 

All items were available only to those in 

.1% income bracket.

And even with these high-profile, ever-

desired options, the most concerning was yet 
to come. The sign described them as exploit-
ed Workers. “LOW STOCK — ACT FAST! 
CAPABLE HUMAN LABOR! AVAILABLE 
FOR MAXIMUM HOURS NEEDED AND 
MINIMUM PAY.” 

My jaw dropped and my lower lip quiv-

ered with fear. How was this possible? How 
was this allowed? My body was shaking, 
eyes widened with terror. 

“Need any help?” I heard as a man 

touched my shoulder, and I was startled by 
the fact that someone else had been here 
the entire time. I turned around. It was the 
University of Michigan’s President, Mark 
Schlissel. 

I shook my head softly, attempting to dis-

guise my frantic state of mind. I didn’t want 
to cause a scene. I didn’t want to be noticed. 
I had to escape. 

“Find what you’re looking for?” he asked 

with an off-putting cheeriness in his tone. 
He appeared to be a store employee, one that 
was particularly unbothered by the apoca-
lyptic surroundings. I worked up the cour-
age not only to speak, but lie my way out. 

“Actually, I’d love to be directed toward 

the exit. I have an emergency at home I have 
to tend to,” I explained weakly. 

“You’re in the right place then! The cash 

register is right ahead,” he gestured forward.

I proceeded onward and was astounded 

by the sight of three identical, late-aged 
white men, each wearing black jackets, 
white shirts and red ties. Their wrinkles all 
tattooed the same areas of their faces and 
hands. The men appeared to be copy-and-
pasted, with robotic body languages similar 
to that of the Agents in “The Matrix.”

“How can we help you today?” they said 

with a monotone, yet somehow condescend-
ing voice. 

“Can you please point me in the direction 

of the exit?” I asked politely, fronting a care-
fully constructed smile to hide my panic. 

“You have to purchase your items before 

you can leave,” the men explained in unison. 

I was perplexed. I had no items in hand to 

purchase.

3 — Wednesday, October 13, 2021 // The Statement
Strawberries and other growing pains

Claire had come 

to resent strawber-

ries. The color, the 
taste, the way the 
seeds got stuck in 
her teeth — every-
thing about them 
exhausted her. She 

stared down at the 

plant, nudging the stem 

with her foot. She felt like 

the berries were mocking her, peering up 
from under the thick, green leaves. Claire 
reached down and plucked one from the 
plant, dropping it into the bucket with more 
than a little hostility. By the 
end of the day, her hands 
would be red and raw 
from the scratchy fibers 
on the underside of the 
leaves, a feeling no 
amount of lotion would 
be able to soothe. When 
she’d finished one plant, she 
moved on to the next, follow-
ing the row all the way to the 
other end of the garden. 

This wasn’t exactly what she’d envi-

sioned for her summer — or her life for that 
matter. By the end of her senior year, she’d 
been unemployed and scrambling, looking 
desperately for something that would be as 
impressive as the jobs her friends had taken 
in New York and Chicago. That’s when 
she found La Ferme Tourrette. Claire had 
been mindlessly scrolling online when she 
found WWOOF, Worldwide Opportuni-
ties for Organic Farms. It’s a program that 
connects people to farms around the world 
where they work in exchange for room and 
board. She read the reviews posted under 
pictures of smiling twenty-somethings 
holding armfuls of produce. 

Claire had imagined herself at a quaint 

but tasteful cottage in the south of France, 
reading in the grass, swimming in ponds, 
learning to speak French and finding farm-
ers markets that were très adorable. It was 
the kind of thing unique, interesting people 
did. She imagined herself saying things like 
“Oh, I just sort of hopped on a plane and 
went.” She’d come home with honey that 
she’d helped make on the farm, an amazing 
tan and stories of dates with French men on 
the back of mopeds. 

What she forgot to imagine was the 

whole farming aspect. 

In theory, she loved the idea of working 

out in the sun, being surrounded by plants 
all day. Once she had actually gotten to the 
farm, though, Claire quickly realized that 
her idealized vision was not grounded in 
reality. The lavender plants were spiky, 
it was impossible to get the carrots out of 
the ground and there was no one to talk 
to in the field. She had never done manual 
labor before (something that had seem-

ingly slipped her mind when applying for 
the program in the first place), and she was 
quickly discovering that it wasn’t her forte. 

As she pulled the berries from their 

stems, she thought of Cowbelles, a movie 
from her childhood about two spoiled girls 
forced to work in their dad’s dairy plant to 
learn the value of hard work. Following 
the lead of cinematic tropes, Claire had 
been expecting some life-changing, “Eat, 
Pray, Love” experience, but so far she didn’t 
know how much she was really learning 
about hard work — other than that she 
didn’t like it. She hated getting up early and 
going to sleep exhausted. The feeling of dirt 
under her fingernails made her skin crawl. 
Maybe she just wasn’t the type for “per-

sonal growth.” Maybe she was too shal-

low or maybe she just wasn’t trying 

hard enough. And after what felt like 
an endless number of strawberries, 
Claire got to the end of the row, 
putting her hands on her hips to 
take a breath. 

“Es-tu fini?” Maryanne, the 

farm’s matriarch asked.

French fluency was one of the 

program’s few requirements — crite-

ria that Claire definitely didn’t meet. So as 
soon as she’d booked her flights, she went 
rummaging through her parents’ library 
and found an old, beat-up French diction-
ary. Claire kept the dictionary tucked in her 
back pocket, keeping a mental list of all the 
words to look up when no one was watch-
ing. She’d picked up on the basics pretty 
quickly: Aller, go. Finir, finish. La ferme, 
the farm.

“Non, j’ai deux en plus,” Claire respond-

ed. No, I have two more. 

Maryanne was nice enough but dis-

tinctly French. She was quick speaking 
and didn’t like explaining things twice. She 
would never hesitate to berate Claire on her 
poor attempts at the language. 

“J’ai deux de plus,” Maryanne corrected. 
Maryanne had two children — both 

boys ages 10 and 13 — and ran the farm on 
her own. She’d been divorced some years 
back, but rarely spoke of her ex-husband. 
Maryanne never shared any details, not 
even his name. The boys, Luca and Paul, 
were sweet yet rowdy, used to having free 
rein over the property while Maryanne 
was working or cooking or dealing with the 
vendors that worked at the markets. Claire 
had a hard time connecting with them. 
Even beyond the language barrier, the boys 
were a bit too old to see their new addition 
as an older sister, yet the age difference 
was a little too large for them to organi-
cally become friends. Not to mention 
that while Maryanne slowed down 
her speaking so Claire could keep up, 
the boys made no such concession, 
exchanging rapid-fire French between 
themselves all day long. 

When Claire had finished plucking 

the last strawberry, she went inside to 
take a shower. Her room was small but 
nicely decorated with yellow walls, rustic 
wooden furniture and a vase of daffodils 
on the window sill. Maryanne had put the 
flowers there before Claire had arrived, 
but a month later, they were wilted and 
starting to lose their petals. She looked at 
the wrinkled stems, thinking about how 
much they had changed since her arrival 
and how she herself had not. She went over 
and started brushing the dry, fallen pieces 
into her hand as she looked outside. Claire 
knew the house must be very old by the 
imperfections in the glass window panes. 
New, manufactured glass all looked the 
same, but with old glass, when you look 
really closely, you can see a subtle pattern 
and tiny bubbles, blemishes from the way 
that it was set that cause the light to reflect 
just a little bit differently. Claire loved glass 
like that. 

As she looked out onto the fields, she 

thought about what she’d be doing if she 
were at home. Her mom would be cooking 
dinner. Her dad would have PBS News-
Hour on too loud in the family room. 
Her mom would make a com-
ment about how the TV was 
making too much noise but 
only quietly and passive-
aggressively to herself. 
Maybe her brother 
would come over. 
Claire would be sit-
ting 
on 

the window bench 
in her room, 

reading with the win-
dows open so she 

could listen to the rain — it rained all sum-
mer in Seattle. She’d be debating how to 
tell her parents she was going to bars with 
friends, and she’d be out late. 

But instead, she was here. 
Exhausted and alone in the countryside 

West of Avignon. Yet as much as she hated 
the strawberries and wished her French 
was better, Claire wasn’t unhappy. She 
wasn’t all that happy either. She was just 
there. 

She would say she was content, a word 

Claire didn’t use often. At home, every day 
either felt like the best or worst she’d ever 
had. Some days, she’d go to the grocery 
store ecstatic about the week ahead. She’d 
plan 
elaborate meals and spend 

way 
too much money on 
clothes online and 

get two iced cof-
fees because on 
a day as beau-
tiful as that, 
how could she 

resist? It was 
on one of these 

ecstatic days that 

she’d booked the 

trip to France in the 

first place. Others, she’d be in bed all day, 
completely unable to do more than the 
absolute bare minimum. But, on the farm, 
she didn’t have the highest highs and the 
lowest lows. She just had 
days. Sure, she wasn’t 
frolicking through 
fields to “The 
Sound 
of 

Music” 
soundtrack-
like 
she’d 

imagined, 
but 

things were alright. 

Claire didn’t have 

the slightest idea what 
she would do when her 
time on the farm was 
over. The end date was just 
three and a half weeks away 
now. She felt just the faintest prickles of 
anxiety creeping up whenever she thought 
of it. She’d always felt an undefined sense 
of excitement about her post-college 20s, 
never anything as concrete as a job or 
where she would live — just an amorphous 

inclination towards the exciting. At 

some point, she’d have to figure out 
what to do, but there were a lot of 
strawberries to pick in the mean-

time. 

When she was done showering, 

Claire went downstairs to help Mary-
anne with dinner. Even with her pocket 
dictionary, Claire only had an operational 
understanding of French, and Maryanne 
had made no effort to learn any English 
(almost as a matter of principle, Claire 
thought), so these downtimes passed 
wordlessly between the two. Over the 
summer, the two women had become 
accustomed to each other, developing 
something that wasn’t quite friendship. 
Camaraderie, maybe? Or was it simply a 
mutual understanding? Whatever their 
relationship was, it made the silence com-
forting. 

Claire and Maryanne moved around 

the kitchen in near synchronization, listen-
ing to the sizzle of shallots in hot oil and 
the satisfying snap of lettuce being torn. 
Luca and Paul came screaming through 
the kitchen, knocking a pile of napkins to 
the floor as they bee-lined their way to the 
backyard. 

“Casse-toi!” Maryanne yelled, long after 

they were out of earshot. 

Stop that. 
Every day as they made dinner, Mary-

anne poured a glass of wine for herself 
and Claire. As the light got softer and their 
shadows got longer, she grabbed the glass-
es. Claire handed her the bottle opener, and 
they both watched as the sun started to dip 
below the horizon. 

“Es-tu heureux ici?” Maryanne asked.
“Yes, I’m happy.”

Wednesday, October 13, 2021 // The Statement — 4

She loved the way the paper felt against 

her fingertips. She slid her thumb across the 
crisp edge, creating yet another fold — the 
blueprint for what was to take shape. 

Today was a record: Beatrix made 990 

before dinnertime. Only 10 away before the 
job was done. Her hands were cramped and 
papercuts lined the webs of her fingers. The 
burbling of her stomach was a testament for 
the strenuous task. 

Paper cranes. 
This obsession was an attempt at rec-

onciliation, first set off when she stumbled 
upon a how-to book at the local church sale. 
It was a 25-cent manual entitled “The Com-
plete Book of Origami.” It sat with a broken 
binding and water-damaged pages. Much of 
the book was unreadable — the aged mildew 
cemented the paper together and faded the 
script. Luckily for Bea, the diagram instruc-
tions and history of the crane remained per-
fectly intact. 

Its rustic charm was in part why she liked 

the book. There was also the fact that it was 
to be her attempt at salvation. A guidebook 
for the lost. 

Despite the manual’s unruly condition, it 

had a sense of safeness about it. A sense 
that Bea had lacked for the past six 
years. 

December 5, 2015. The day 

her world ended, the day they 
walked out of her life. Not 
even a paper note was left for 
a final goodbye. Such lack 
of closure opened a new 
chapter in Bea’s life, a chap-
ter that detailed her endless 
pursuit of paper. 

At first, she used receipts 

and old National Geographic 
magazines to craft her cranes — the 
only materials she could find on street 
corners or in recycling bins. The printed 
images and ink on the page made it diffi-
cult to make a solid, intentional crease, yet 
the vibrancy of the pictures made up for the 
medium’s poor composition. 

They were colorful creatures each with 

their own pictorial personality. The beaks 
pointed confidently upward; the wings 
slightly misshapen. 

An obsession. Something that con-

sumed her day-to-day activities and spare 
moments. An endless pursuit of paper. 

Such obsession traveled with her every-

where she went. When Bea would go out to 
eat, she would unroll the napkin folder and 
create the first fold — all before the waitress 
could even greet her table.

When Bea would get home from school, 

she would immediately take out her graded 

tests and marked notebook paper to begin 
the craft — all paper birds, a not so helpful 
study tool. 

1,000 of their faceless and nameless bod-

ies joined her paper family each day. 

Though she had a multitude of name-

less, identical birds, Bea had her favorites — 
namely the ones made from newspaper. She 
lingered around the newsstand each Sunday 
as a young boy refilled the box, catching its 
lid before the compartment clicked shut. 
The smell of the fresh press combined with 
the lightness of the paper made for a lively 
crane, one plastered with a variety of words 
and news about climate change or abuse 
scandals, all of which she couldn’t begin to 
understand. 

Paper cranes.
Each had its own story, yet all possessed 

the same intent. Her paper family, now 
more like a paper army, were her remedy. 
The magic elixir to the world’s unavoidable 
afflictions. The cure to nature’s unknow-
able plan. 

She 

began to fold 
each morning until 
all 1,000 were made each night, the water-
logged manual as her origami Bible. 

“According to Japanese tradition, the 

crane lives for 1,000 years. Those who create 
these detailed folds and create 1,000 shall 
therefore be granted one special wish.” 

The short description located at the heart 

of the book was her guiding phrase, a state-
ment that was to change the course of her 
life. An endless pursuit of wishes; wishes 
made of paper. 

Her one wish was never to come true. 

Despite her efforts, she was one paper crane 

too little too late. Her work was never to be 
finished. The wish to bring them back. This 
was why she saw Dr. Lee each Thursday, 
completing her cranes before every appoint-
ment to make up for lost time.

“How are you feeling today Beatrix?” he 

would ask. 

“I am feeling hopeful today.”
Dr. Lee then proceeded to justify her 

grief, eventually asking, “Why don’t you tell 
me about your paper cranes?”

Bea dodged the question each time, pan-

tomiming the folds out of stress. The real 
reason was too painful to explain even to 
a trained professional. She creates cranes 
each day to forget her pain, to wishfully 
attempt to undo it. Not to bring it up to a 
stranger who she believed had no potential 
to ease her hurt. He was not made of paper.

Dr. Lee diagnosed her with OCD and 

depression, remedied with prescription 
medication 
 — a slip of paper signed with a 

messy signature that quickly turned into a 

paper bird. 

All 

1,000 pointed 

faces and tails represented 

a chance at health and healing; a chance 
of continued beauty and grace. A chance 
that she fell short of taking; a chance 
she wouldn’t let slip through her fingers 
again. 

Each night when she went home, she 

would line them on her bedroom floor, cre-
ating a fleet. Although Bea was possessive 
over her paper creations, sometimes she 
would make a few extra to leave behind on 
park benches or headstones. She often felt 
selfish for hoarding so many wishes, there-
fore it was only right to potentially help 

the next girl from taking on an unbearable 
load of grief. Maybe, just maybe, .001% of 
a wish would mean a difference for some-
one who experienced death and loneliness. 
A tangible sign from heaven that Bea was 
the deliverer of. Her role was like that of a 
spiritual intermediary, a role she wished 
someone would fill for her. 

 On a day like this where she had made 

so many in so little time, she would write a 
note to them on the scrap page before fold-
ing it into shape. It was a painful process, 
yet a therapeutic one. Bea wrote in pencil, 
for her mistakes and loss for words were 
plentiful. Her eraser was worn to a mere 
nub. The tiny, rolled shavings brushed off 
the table formed a disorderly pile beneath 
her feet. 

To you. Erase. To the one I miss the 

most. Erase. 

Dear you,
Your birthday is this week, as you know. 

I have been preparing and collecting extra 
scraps to celebrate you. I left one in our 
spot yesterday, one made of newspaper. I 
hope you don’t mind. As an update, I have 
made 2,187,000 wishes to bring you back 

to me. Three more sets of wishes until 

the big day. I hope you are proud of 

me. 

With love. Erase. Please come 
home. Erase. I miss you, Bea.

Unsatisfied.
She crumpled up the 

page. A crime. A death in 
the family. A waste of mate-
rial and energy.

She never could quite put 

into words what she wanted 
to say. She was so angry and 

confused at them for leaving, 

something out of her control that 

she is now so desperately trying to 

understand. 
They would never come back. If they 

wanted to, they would. 2,187,000 are surely 
enough wishes. Yet they are never enough. 

It took her six years and countless ther-

apy sessions to realize this. Beatrix is a 
crumpled piece of paper with irremovable 
damage. No amount of flattening, pressing 
and pleading can undo a crisp crease. No 
amount of folding, wishing and creating 
cranes can bring them back. Too far gone, 
dead. 

She hated the way the paper felt against 

her fingertips. She slid her thumb across 
the crisp edge, undoing the folds — the 
blueprint for what was never meant to take 
shape. 

Paper Cranes. 
She destroyed every single one.
