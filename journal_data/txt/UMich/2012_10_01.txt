Alcohol violations rose and
larcenies decreased last year
on and near University prop-
erty, acc5rding to the Univer-
sity's annual security and fire
safety report released Sunday,
which chronicled the 2,316 total
offenses reported in 2011.
The report, released by the
University's Department of
Public Safety, details overall
statistics for reported crimes in
2011. The University is required
by the Clery Act - a federal law
thatregulates methodologies for
reporting collegiate crimes - to
report annual criminal statistics
to students and employees.
The crimes recorded in the
report include incidents that
occurred on campus, on public
property adjacent to campus
such as city sidewalks or streets,

University properties, fraterni-
ties, sororities and co-op houses.
An overwhelming amount
of the crimes were larcenies
or drug and alcohol violations.
There were 1,215 total alcohol
law violations reported in 2011,
up about 30 percent from 934 in
2010. Citations or arrests were
made for Minor in Possession,
Public Intoxication or other
related crimes in 358 cases, a
decrease of about 20, percent
from the 2010 report.
Notably, there were 855 on-
campus alcohol law violations
referred for disciplinary action
and counseling through the
University's Office of Student
Conflict Resolution - all but
one occurred in a University
residence hall. Alcohol law vio
lations referred for disciplinary
action increased about 77 per-

only 483.
Brown said it's unclear what
caused the increase in alcohol

ary action.

For the Daily
Though many University
students are already swamped
with reading, they now have the
opportunity to access an entirely
new collection of works.
This fall, the University
launched a reciprocal borrowing
program with Eastern Michigan
University that grants access to
library resources at EMU and the
University's Ann Arbor and Flint
campuses for faculty, students
and staff at both schools.
In order for University stu-
dents to borrow from the Halle
Library at EMU, they must fill
out a registration form available
online or at the Hatcher Gradu-

CORNELL STUDENTS
HOSPITALIZED AT
AVICII SHOW
Six Cornell University stu-
dents were hospitalized at
an Avicii concert held on the
school's homecoming weekend,
and The Cornell University
Police Department received 12
calls regarding alcohol-related
problems at the event The Cor-
nell Daily Sun reported last
week.

The Daily Sun reported that
many of the hospitalized stu-
dents never made it into the
show, and many of the alcohol-
related incidents also involved
inappropriate touching at the
concert ticket line.
Dave Rodriguez, a Cornell
student and executive director
of Cornell Concert Commis-
sion, told The Daily Sun that
the chaos likely stemmed from
the events of the homecoming
weekend.
'Unfortunately, a lot of peo-
ple aren't able to take care of
themselves in these sorts of
situations," he said.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Detroit water
workers on strike
Employees of Detroit's water
and sewer system, which serves
four in 10 Michigan residents,
went on strike Sunday to protest
plans to eliminate most of their
jobs through privatization or
other measures.
The union for 950 employees
of the Detroit Water and Sewer-
age Department said its mem-
bers went on strike about 10 a.m.
Sunday, setting up a picket line at
a wastewater treatment plant in
southwest Detroit's Delray neigh-
borhood.
"Workers are very happy to
be fighting for a change," said
Michael Muholland, secretary-
treasurer of American Federation
of State County and Municipal
Employees Local 207. "Detroit
has been taking it in the neck for
so long."
DALLAS
3.4 magnitude
quake hits Dallas
A small earthquake followed
by an aftershock rattled a suburb
west of Dallas overnight, crack-
ing some walls and knocking,
down pictures, but authorities
reported no serious damage and
the unscathed Dallas-Fort Worth
airport near the epicenter kept up
normal flight operations.
Emergency officials said they
had no indications of any inju-
ries from Saturday's late-night
quake.
The initial earthquake mea-
suring a preliminary magnitude
of 3.4 struck at 11:05 p.m. CDT
on Saturday and was centered
about 2 miles north of the Dallas
suburb of Irving, the US Geologi-
cal Survey's national earthquake
monitoring center in Golden,
Colo., reported. USGS Geophysi-
cist Randy Baldwin told The
Associated Press from Colorado
that the initial quake lasted
several seconds and appeared
strong enough to be felt up to 15
or 20 miles away.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti'
Thousands in
Haiti protest gov't
Several thousand people
poured into the streets of Haiti's
capital on Sunday to protest the
government of President Michel
Martelly.
It was among the biggest dem-
onstrations this year in Port-
au-Prince against the first-time
leader as he tries to rebuild the
impoverished nation following a
powerful 2010 earthquake that
displaced more than a million
people and destroyed thousands
of homes.
Demonstrators' complaints
included the high cost of living,
rising food prices and allega-
tions of corruption as they snaked
through the poorer neighbor-
hoods Port-au-Prince.
The Martelly government had
no immediate public reaction to

the protest.
EAST LANSING, Mich.
MSU to get $45-
million to educate
African students
Michigan State University is
getting $45 million for the educa-
tion of 185 African students over
the next nine years under a new
scholarship program.
The East Lansing school says
the money comes out of a $500
millioneffortthat the MasterCard
Foundation unveiled Wednesday.
The university says the money
will pay for the education of 100
undergraduates and 85 master's
degree students. It says it's the
only university in the Midwest
participating in the program.
Michigan State President Lou
Anna Simon says "Africa now
hosts seven of the world's 10 fast-
est-growing national economies
and is the world's youngest conti-
nent demographically."
But she says poverty in Africa is
responsible for a lag in secondary
and higher education rates there.

Attacks by Afghan
soldiers, police
on U.S. forces has
caused toll to climb
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- The killing of an American
serviceman in an exchange of
fire with allied Afghan soldiers
pushed U.S. .military deaths in
the war to 2,000,a cold reminder
of the perils that remain after an
11-year conflict that now garners
little public interest at home.
The toll has clilnbed steadily
in recent months with a spate
of attacks by Afghan army and
police - supposed allies --against
American and NATO troops.
"The tally is modest by the
standards of war historically, but
every fatality is a tragedy and 11
years is too long," said Michael
O'Hanlon, a fellow at the Brook-
ings Institution in Washington.
"All that is internalized, however,
in an American public that has
been watching this campaign for
a long time. More newsworthy
right now are the insider attacks
and the sense of hopelessness
they conveyto many. "
Attacks by Afghan soldiers or
police - or insurgents disguised
in their uniforms - have killed
52 American and other NATO
troops so far this year.
The insider attacks are con-
sidered one of the most serious
threats to the U.S. exit strategy
from the country. In its latest
incarnation, that strategy has
focused on training Afghan forces

to take over security nationwide -
allowing mostforeigntroops to go
home by the end of 2014.
As part of that drawdown, the
first 33,000 U.S. troops withdrew
by the end of September, leaving
68,000 still in Afghanistan.
The program to train and
equip 350,000 Afghan policemen
and soldiers has cost the Ameri-
can taxpayer more than $22 bil-
lion in the past three years.
The most recent attack came
just days after Defense Secretary
Leon Panetta said most U.S. and
coalition combatunits inAfghan-
istan returned to their practice of
partnering with Afghan forces,
nearly two weeks after the top
U.S. commander put restrictions
on such cooperation.
On Sunday, U.S. officials con-
firmed the deaths of two Ameri-
cans, a service member and a
civilian contractor killed late Sat-
urday.
The fighting started when
insurgents attacked a checkpoint
set up by U.S. forces in eastern
Wardak province, said Shahidul-
lah Shahid, a provincial govern-
ment spokesman. The Americans
thought they were under attack
from their allies at a nearby
Afghan army checkpoint and
fired on it. The Afghan soldiers
returned fire, Shahid said.
The Afghan Defense Minis-
try spokesman said the shooting
broke out as a result of a "misun-
derstanding" while ISAF forces
were on patrol near an Afghan
army checkpoint.
NATO's International Secu-
rity Assistance Force, commonly
referred to as ISAF, gave a differ-

ent account of the fighting in Sayd
Abad district.
"After a short conversation
took place between (Afghan
army) and ISAF personnel, fir-
ing occurred which resulted in
the fatal wounding of an ISAF
soldier and the death of his civil-
ian colleague," the coalition said
in a statement. It said the three
Afghan soldiers died "in an ensu-
ing exchange of fire."
According to the Afghanistan
index keptby Brookings, about 40
percent of the American deaths
were caused by improvised
explosive devices. The majority
of those were after 2009, when
President Barack Obama ordered
a surge that sent in 33,000 addi-
tional troops to combat height-
ened Taliban activity. The surge
brought the total number of
American troops to 101,000, the
peak for the entire war.
In recent years, some of those
casualties have generated a great
deal of criticism from President
Hamid Karzai and changed
the way NATO forces carry out
airstrikes. The overwhelming
majority of civilian casualties are
caused by insurgents - with the
United Nations blaming them
for more than 50 percent of the
deaths and NATO putting that
figure at more than 90 percent.
Obama deployed more troops
to Afghanistan, and casualties
increased sharply in the last
several years. But the American
public grew weary of having its
military in a perpetual state of
conflict, especially after the with-
drawal of American troops from
Iraq at the end of last year.

Turkey provides
haven for rebels,
refugees fleeing
violence
BEIRUT (AP) - A suicide
attacker detonated a car bomb
near a Syrian security com-
pound in a remote, predomi-
nantly Kurdish town Sunday,
killing at least four people, state
media said, in a new sign that
the country's largest ethnic
minority might be drawn into a
widening civil war.
Opposition activists said at
least eight Syrian intelligence
agents were killed and several
dozen people wounded in the
attack in the northeastern town
of Qamishli, more than 700
kilometers (435 miles) from the
capital Damascus.
Syria's more than 2 million
Kurds, long marginalized, have
largely stayed out of the fight-
ing, though some have partici-
pated in protests against the
regime of President Bashar
Assad.
The uprising against Assad
that erupted 18 months ago
has gradually morphed into a
bloody civil war. The conflict
has killed more than 30,000
people, activists say, and has
devastated entire neighbor-
hoods in Syria's main cities,
including Aleppo, the scene of
intense fighting Sunday.
The leaders of Turkey and
Egypt, among Assad's main
foreign foes, sent stern warn-
ings to the regime and its allies,
in speeches to Turkey's ruling
party.
Egyptian President Moham-
med Morsi said that "we will be
on the side of the Syrian people
until the bloodshed ends, the
cruel regime is gone and Syrian
people reach their just rights."
Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged
Syria's allies Russia, China and
Iran to end their support for
Assad, warning that "history
will not forgive those who stand
together with cruel regimes."
Turkey has given shelter to
tens of thousands of Syrian
refugees and Turkish soil has
served as a crucial logistical
center for rebel fighters since
they captured several Syrian
border crossings with Turkey
over the summer.
Also over the summer, Syrian
troops left several towns and
villages in the Kurdish north-
east, possibly to divert forces
to overstretched troops fight-
ing in hotspots elsewhere. The

regime ceded de facto control
to Kurdish fighters who began
exercising a degree of autonomy
unheard of before.
However, the regime has
maintained a security pres-
ence in Qamishli, which abuts
the Turkish border, said Rami
Abdul-Rahman, head of the
Britain-based Syrian Obser-
vatory for Human Rights, an
activist group.
There was no immediate
claim of responsibility for Sun-
day's blast. Several previous
suicide attacks in Syria were
claimed by a Syrian militant
group, the Al-Nusra Front.
Syrian state media said the
explosion went off in an area
housing security officers. It
said four.people were killed,
dozens wounded and nearby
buildings damaged. An amateur
video posted online by activ-
ists showed a column of white
smoke rising between buildings
in Qamishli.
Most Kurds live in the north-
east, but Aleppo and Damascus
also have Kurdish-dominated
neighborhoods.
Fighting continued Sunday in
several areas of Aleppo, as part
of what rebels say is new push to
drive out regime forces. Oppo-
sition fighters seized several
areas in an initial offensive two
months ago, but were unable
to keep up the momentum.
On Thursday, they announced
what they said would be a deci-
sive battle.
Either side could potentially
shift the direction of an other-
wise stalemated war if it seizes
Aleppo, a city of 3 million peo-
ple.
Abdel Kader, a commander
of the Tawhid Brigade, the larg-
est rebel unit in Aleppo, said by
phone from Aleppo that his men
were fighting in seven areas
Sunday. Pro-Assad troops have
been shelling rebel-held dis-
tricts. Amateur video posted by
activists SundayShowed Syrian
warplanes flying over the city
and heavy smoke rising from
the city's skyline.
Another video showed night
fighting. "We want to liberate
the city from these shabiha,"
a man says in the background,
referring to Syria's pro-Assad
militiamen.
In the video, what appears to
be a rebel fighter firing projec-
tiles from the cover of a hillside
to the shouts of "God is Great"
from others nearby.
Syria imposes tight restric-
tions on foreign reporters and
the authenticity of the videos
could not be verified indepen-
dently.

Somalia's capital and sowed fear
throughout the southern part of
the country are fleeing their last
remaining stronghold because
they are outgunned and don't
want heavy losses, experts said
Sunday.
Kenyan troops invaded the
southern Somali city of Kis-
mayo early Friday, and the mili-
tant Islamist group al-Shabab
announced soon after that their
forces were leaving the lucrative
port town behind. Kenyan forc-
es have not yet moved through
the whole town, but a military

spokesman said troops met no
resistance on Sunday.
Kenyan forces invaded Soma-
lia late last year, and have been
moving slowlytoward Kismayo.
The once-powerful al-Shabab
spent years defending its Moga-
dishu territory, but since being
forced out has chosen to retreat
from towns when challenged by
African Union forces or Ethiopi-
an troops who moved into west-
ern Somalia earlier this year.
"The most plausible explana-
tion is that they fear that they'll
be outgunned by the coalition
force, and as a result are incentiv-
ized to retreat," said Abdihakim
Aynte, a Somali political analyst
in Mogadishu.
Col. Cyrus Oguna, the spokes-
man for the Kenyan military, said
that Kenyan troops nowstationed
in northern Kismayo are making
plans to expand south. Oguna

said he didn't know how many
al-Shabab fighters are left in Kis-
mayo, but that "we can probably
say nowthat the numbers are less
than when we got in."
An al-Shabab spokesman said
on Twitter that the militants
had left town and residents have
reported that government and
police buildings once occupied by
al-Shabab have been abandoned.
Oguna said Kenyan forces are pre-
pared for multiple scenarios.
Yusuf Abdi Hussein, a former
colonel in the Somali army, said
the future political leadership of
Kismayo will also dictate what
al-Shabab does. The new admin-
istration will either empower or
thwart their guerrilla attacks, he
said.
"Usually Kismayo is contested
by rival clans seeking to manipu-
late the resources and revenues
from the port," Hussein said.

Texas messes
Schools should abandon corporal punishment
When a student violates a school policy in Texas, the pun-
ishment, depending on their action, could be as far-
reaching as the paddle. At least this is what happened
in Springtown, Texas, last week when a 15-year-old girl was pad-
dled by her school's assistant principal. As a result, the girl's moth-
er brought the issue to the school board, who then expanded their
corporal punishment policy. This decision should be reversed and
corporal punishment should be restricted to allow for only same-
gender punishment, if any at all.

On behalf of your Central Stu-
dent Government, please allow me
to extend my warm wishes to you
on this auspicious Mid-Autumn.
Festival. Here at Michigan, we have
a considerable East Asian popula-
tion and we want you to know that
your traditions and culture enrich
our campus community and are
very important to us.
We know that this day is among
the most important holidays in
the Chinese calendar and it's also
celebrated widely in Vietnam and
Taiwan, among other places. This
ancient holiday started at least dur-
ing the Tang dynasty, so it's truly
a very rich tradition, passed down
from generation to generation.
This year, your Central Student

Government will strive.to be even
more inclusive and welcoming. We
would love to celebrate the wonder-
ful holidays and festivals that are
meaningful to all members of our
student body.
Our outstanding Chair of the
Minority Affairs Commission,
Julia Papiyants, would love to hear
from you regarding how you cel-
ebrated your Mid-Autumn Festival
- so please e-mail her at jpapiyan@
umich.edu, and feel free to ask her
how you can join this Commis-
sion as well! If there's anything
that I can personally do to make
your Michigan experience better,
I'm always just an e-mail away -
mrparikh@umich.edu.
"May we live long and share the

beauty of the moon together, even
if we are hundreds of miles apart,"
says a beautiful ancient poem.
Today, many of you are away from
your families, and whether you
choose to light a lantern or follow
some other rich traditions of the
day, we thank you for making our
community so rich and diverse, and
hope you have a wonderful Mid-
Autumn Festival, filled with happi-
ness, celebration and laughter.
I join members of your elected
Assembly, your vice president Omar

mission chair Julia Papiyants and
everyone else from our CSG family,
in sending our warmest wishes.

Texas is one of 19 states that haven't banned
corporal punishment. According to Texas law,
there's no comment on the gender or age of
the student being punished, and in order for
a child to avoid corporal punishment the par-
ent must opt-out in writing. In this particular
incident, the mother complained, not because
the school subjected her daughter to physical
punishment, but because she was paddled by a
man, and left with severe welting. When it was
brought to the attention of the school board
that their same-gender corporal punishment
policy had been violated, instead of punishing
the assistant principal, the board expanded the
policy to allow it across genders.
Thistype of violent and humiliating pun-
ishment has no place in an educational envi-
ronment. According to a 2010 report by the
Center for Effective Discipline, 75 percent
of states that allow corporal punishment are
below the national average in ACT scores
and 75 percent of the states that have out-
lawed corporal punishment are above the
national average. Furthermore, the 10 low-
est-performing states on the ACT are states
allowing corporal punishment. While it's dif-
ficult to correlate corporal punishments and
test scores, educational achievement clearly

needs to be the focus.
In order for a child to avoid corporal pun-
ishment under the current Texas law, their
parent has to send in a letter specifically
requesting that their child is exempt. Even
if corporal punishment has the support of
Texas voters, the policy should have to opt-in
rather than opt-out of it, if allowed at all.
Furthermore, the lack of policy regarding
age limits or gender restrictions creates inap-
propriate situations. When a middle-aged
man spanks a teenage girl, there is an inher-
ently inappropriate dynamic added to the sit-
uation. Neither students nor teachers should
be subjected to this type of educational envi-
ronment. Many students who are subjected to
this punishment are young adults who under-
stand why their behavior is wrong and do not
require physical discipline.
Striking children in schools is not only
wrong, but also detrimental to their educa-
tion. Corporal punishment is not acceptable
in any educational situation and is particu-
larly inappropriate when administered to an
older age group or when adults of the oppo-
site sex are involved in the punishment. An
educator's job should not be expanded to
include physical punishment.

Cain the comedian

My night with Herman

The truth? You know, after Thursday
night, I'm not so sure I can handle the
truth. Or at least the College Truth
Tour's version of it.
Alright, backing up:
Sept. 27, Herman Cain !
and the subsequent Cain/
train jokes stopped by the
Power Center to have a
little chat about the econ-
omy. But don't be fooled,
fool - though Cain's busi- MELANIE
ness was all business, it KRUVELIS
hardly took any time at all
for the former Republican
presidential candidate to
get swept up in Wolverine spirit.
"Aw, shucky ducky," Cain's speech began.
"Now let me see if I'm in the right place - uh,
Go Blue?"
Ah, yes, Go Blue indeed. And what the hell,
go red, too - after all, this was a cross-party
fiesta. Just ask the uncomfortably pluralized
Job Creators Solutions group, the organiza-
tion that brought Cain and the College Truth
Tour to Ann Arbor. According to their web-
site, the College Truth Tour is a bipartisan
initiative devoted to setting students straight
on matters of the economy. And if you have
any doubts about the bipartisan-ness of a lec-
ture from a Republican presented by the Col-
lege Republicans, never fear - the bleeding
hearts got their word in. Specifically, from
the back row of the auditorium, usually offer-
ing a poignant rebuttal to whatever poignant
point Cain made. Just listen:
"The United States does not have a sugar
daddy," Cain yelled. "Who we gonna borrow
from?"
"Australia!" someone shouted from the
crowd. "Germany! China!"
And the geography lesson continued for
another thirty seconds.
Actually, there were a lot of lessons to be
learned Thursday night, courtesy of the god-
father of Pizza and the Truth Tourers. For
instance, after the speech, I added "Tax-
mageddon" to my growing list of reasons to
hide my kids and hide my wife for indefinite
periods of time. "The Taxmageddon is com-
ing!" Cain warned the crowd. "I don't know
when it's at but ... it's coming."
And another moral culled from the evening:
History is what you make of it. Or, perhaps
more accurately, what you feel like making up
about it.
"The Founders had the vision to write ...
'All men and women are created equal,"' Cain
argued in his defense of the Declaration of
Independence.

"Actually, that's a lie," responded a voice
from the crowd, referring to the exclusion of
women's rights in the document. You know,
the little missing piece that resulted in an
ongoing struggle for gender equality.
"I know the Declaration of Independence,
thank you," Cain retorted. Then he started rat-
tling off other lines from what he described as
"the greatest document next to the Bible."
But like always, Cain got back on his feet,
because dammit, this event was all about the
truth! We wanted the facts, and boy, did he
give them to us.
"A trillion is a million, million!"
Uh, no, not that one, I meant -
"I did that job for nine months. Then for
three years."
Ah, ok, not what I was talking about but -
"I used to watch 30-minute sitcoms!"
Well, you get the idea.
But in all seriousness folks, if we get
beyond the "USA" chants, the shouts for
pizza and pretty much all the jeers from ine-
briated Obama fans looking for a good laugh,
Cain really did have a message that we can
all get behind - inform yourself.
"Stay informed," he told the audience.
"Because stupid people are ruining Amer-
ica." Harsh? Maybe. But there was no way
this crowd could get offended - I mean,
do you really think stupid people show up
to the College Truth Tour? No, the Cain-
Trainwreck argued. America needs
heroes. Dreamers. Winners. And we're
not going to get those if we don't
educate ourselves. So stay
informed, he told us.

Although his
epic quote from
a Pokdmon movie
eventually stole the show, his stance
on tax reform predictably riled up
the crowd.
Like many conservatives, Cain
supports an overhauled tax code
that simplifies the entire process
and lowers rates for at least some
Americans, if not all. As Cain rein-
forced during his speech, it's Amer-
ica's "record-high" - they're not

omy to be financially dis-
traught; the only
reason Amer-
ica was able
to succeed

taxes.
As if this
statement
wasn't
gener-

alizing enough, Cain then involved
the crowd by asking: "Who here
thinks raising taxes raises govern-
ment revenue?" He was quickly dis-
appointed by the people who raised
their hands in massive amounts.
"No, no, no!" Cain yelled, "You're
wrong, we need to lower taxes like
Reagan did!" Although I found
myself laughing throughout most
of Cain's speech, it was after he
made this string of statements that
I found myself practically falling in
the aisle.,
Let's look a little closer at these
claims to fully appreciate thehilari-
ty. First, let's acknowledge the selec-
tive memory that Cain and many.
of his fellow conservatives have,
including Republican presidential
candidate Mitt Romney. Why is it
that the economic boom of the 1990s
that involved a record reduction in
poverty, incredibly low unemploy-
ment rates, and massive government
surpluses always seems to be coinci-
dentally forgotten by any prominent
Republican? Instead, we have to
look at the "Reagan Years" or some
distant time period like the 1950s to
fully understand why the economy is
as bad as it is.
The reason for this selective mem-
ory is simple. Republicans hate to
admit that from 1992 to 2000 when
Bill Clinton was president, America
saw some of its most financially suc-
cessful years. Republicans simply
hate to admit that a crazy "tax and
spend" Democrat could have done
a better job handling the American
economy than Ronald Reagan or
other recent Republicans.
What really ticks off Republicans
isn't necessarily that it was a
Democrat who helped
generate this financial
boom - it was the
way he did it. Under
Clinton, tax rates
for the wealthy
rose from 31 per-
cent to 39.6 per-
cent, all while
the GDP grew
by an average
of 5 percent per
year.
Today, the
tax rate on
America's
highest earn-
ers is 35 per-
cent thanks
to President
George W.
Bush's tax
cuts, and the
effective cor-
porate tax rate
is 12.6 percent - a
60-year low according

to the Congressional Budget Office.
Moreover, GDP grew by approxi-
mately zero percent from 2000-
2010. Taxes are not at a record high,
nor do high taxes simply cause eco-
nomic recessions.
You'll often hear Republicans
praise Reagan as the great tax cut-
ter of American history, thus caus-
ing the economic success during
his presidential tenure. Reagan
certainly was a tax cutter in many
instances, but during his eight years
as president, Reagan increased taxes
a total of 11 times, all while keeping
the government revenue at a steady
18.2 percent of GDP.
As most Reagan insiders acknowl-
edge, Reagan realized the threat of
a growing federal deficit and under-
stood that in order to pay some of
America's debt, he was goingto have
to couple tax hikes with spending
cuts. Reagan was also quoted mul-
tiple times saying that $10 in spend-
ing cuts coupled with one dollar in
tax increases is a fair deal that any
Republican should take.
During one of the early Republi-
can debates in 2011, the candidates
were asked the question "Would
you ever raise taxes if you were
president?" Every single Republican
candidate said that under no cir-
cumstance would they ever consider
raising taxes.
Unfortunately, modern-day
Republicans are too politically
hamstrung to even acknowledge.
the concept. I'm not saying that
raising taxes causes economic
booms nor will it be the sole solu-
tion to paying off America's debt.
But I am refuting the Republican
myth that in order to see finan-
cially successful times, taxes must
be as low as possible. Don't get me
wrong, our government needs to
lower its speiding, especially in
areas of defense, but taxes are a
vital government function and they
must be part of the solution for pay-
ing America's ballooning debt.
Considering that Cain's candi-
dacy went down in flames and he's
about as close to the presidency
as John Edwards is, it is okay for
him to quote Pokemon and discuss
a "Sim City"-inspired "9-9-9" tax
code. But other prominent Repub-
licans, especially Romney, need to
understand that tax increases are
not necessarily going to cause the
next recession. In fact, they very
well could lead to economic recov-
ery. Instead of gaining advice from
such lovable characters as Pikachu,
I think it's time for Republicans to
take tax reform seriously.

Let's learn a FilmDistrict
thing or two
from "Loop-
er" and cut straight to the chase
- Johnson's action/thriller/
science-fiction tour de force has
more jaw-dropping, what-the-
fuck moments than "Inglourious
Basterds" and this year's "Cabin
in the Woods" combined.
In other words, this movie
is good - really good. Not just
because it's so unpretentious
and to-the-point that the recent
string of mindless superhero
movies seem like they're feeding
us fodder instead of food, but also
because "Looper" leaves people
debating its story in the most
"Inception"-esque way since,
well, "Inception."
Screenwriters today forget
the Golden Rule of Writing: If
you want the audience's atten-
tion, write a solid introduction for
your script. "Looper" demands
its viewers' undivided attention
right from the get-go. Based ini-
tially in 2040s Kansas, the film
begins with Joe (Joseph Gordon-
Levitt, "The Dark Knight Rises"),
a looper, waiting for his target to
arrive from the future. As Gor-
don-Levitt's voice narrates dur-

"Who's friend-zoned now, Zooey?"
ing the opening sequences, time
travel won't be invented until 30
years later and will be quickly
outlawed, only to be used by the
mob to send targets to the past to
be obliterated. Loopers have only
one rule: Don't let your targets
escape - even if these targets are
their own future selves.
When it's time for Joe to "close
the loop" by killing his future self
(Bruce Willis, "Moonrise King-
dom"), he finds that his future
self - let's call him Old Joe - has
other plans: To kill the future
mob boss, "Rainmaker," during
his childhood. Young Joe lands
a list of Old Joe's suspects and
decides to wait for him at one of
the marked locations - a farm-
house occupied by Sara (Emily
Blunt, "The Five-Year Engage-
ment") and her ten-year-old son
Cid (Pierce Gagnon, "The Cra-
zies"). Through a series of twists
and turns that bring old Joe face-
to-face with some of his old pals
and girlfriends, we finally realize

which child the Rainmaker really
is - namely, the extraordinary
psychic who can blow people to
scraps with just a scream.
There are loopholes in "Loop-
er." But what time travel movie
doesn't have some? It's an inevi-
table side effect of document-
ing alternative realities. While
debates about how changing
something in the present could
affect the future are sound and
just, they're also inconsequen-
tial to the bigger picture: Time
traveling is merely an underly-
ing contextual theme that allows
Johnson to do some mind-blow-
ing things with this film.
Aside from the plot-gaps, and
a somewhat unfulfilling end that
leaves you mouthing, "Wait, that's
it?," this film is pretty damn excit-
ing. Johnson doesn't dumb down
anything. There's no sympathy in
the way Old Joe hunts down his
kid suspects or Young Joe blows
up every mob worker who gets
in his way. The characters' ruth-

lessness and over-the-top ballsy
actions even occasionally border
on hilarity because Johnson's not
trying to be stylish. This isn't film
noir - this is action at its rawest,
loudest best.
As for Willis, Gordon-Levitt
and Blunt: Needless to say they
live up to their reputations and
make one heck of a bad-ass team.
They play vulnerable people with
guns and guts with phenomenal
talent (like that's a big surprise).
The surprise however comes
from the film's makeup team,
who expertly transform Gordon-
Levitt from his usual hipster-cool
self to a coldblooded killer.
Forget the loopholes and the
abrupt, it-can't-be-over-already
ending - "Looper" is a bucket-
load of surprises, gunshots and
blood-spurting gore. It's a place
where battered, graffitied Hon-
das meet flying motorbikes. And
it's probably the best time-travel/
science-fiction film since "The
Terminator."

Martin's humor returns to television

By ANDREW ECKHOUS happen
Daily Arts Writer every q

Demetri Martin has the pedi-
gree of a United States president.
Born in New York City, his father
was a Greek Orthodox priest and
his mother, a nutritionist. He
graduated from Yale in 1995,
and turned down Harvard Law,
instead accepting a full ride
offer from NYU Law.
But that's where the similari-
ties end. After two years, Martin
dropped out.
In a conference call with The
Michigan Daily, Martin said, "I
just dreaded every day. I would
wake up in the morning and not
want to get out of bed."
That's when Martin began his
career as a comedian - and it's
a decision that has proven wise.
When speaking with the
39-year-old Martin, his intelli-

During the hour-long con-

was that he had succeeded as a

Campaign to train former service
members interested in running for

He notes that as the number
of veterans on Capitol Hill has
dropped,there has been "analmost

confidence in Congress."
"I'm not saying that the two are
necessarily a causal relationship,"
says Lynn. "But I do think that
there is that ability to put your
country before yourself, but also
to work together across party
lines, that Americans want
more that just isn't happening in
Washington."
There is a natural ebb and flow
to this nexus between military
and public service.
When World War II ended,
16 million men and women had
served in uniform around the
globe, and as a result postwar
politicians were often veterans.
The pool of veterans grew smaller
in followingyears, especially since
the end of the military draft in
1973.
The all-volunteer military
engenders a sense of duty and
"selflessness" that Lynn and
others feel has been sorely lacking,
in the political arena. He sees
this quality as a motivation for
veteran-candidates today.

Residents make
costly trip to cast
votes at consulate
MIAMI(AP) - By bus and car,
commercial flight and charter,
U.S.-based Venezuelans are trav-
eling en masse to New Orleans
in the coming days, spending
hundreds of dollars and in some
cases more than a day of their
time to cast a vote in their coun-
try's presidential election.
The government of President
Hugo Chavez earlier this year
closed the country's consulate in
Miami, where most Venezuelans
living in the U.S. have cast bal-
lots in the past. It later said vot-
ers would have to travel to New
Orleans if they want to partici-
pate on Oct. 7.
It's a hardship in terms of time
and money for many potential
voters. But some, especiallythose
who want to stop Chavez from
being re-elected after 13 years in
power, are determined to make
the trip anyway.
Carolina Guevara, a 21-year-
old college student, plans to take
the 15-hour bus ride from Miami
to New Orleans, an 870-mile trek.
"We want to demonstrate to
the government that even if they
put obstacles in our path, we will,
practice our right to vote," said
Guevara, who hopes to return to
Venezuela after completing her
political science studies at Miami
Dade College.
The Venezuelan government
closed its Miami mission after
the State Department expelled
consul Livia Acosta amid an
investigation into recordings
that seemed ts implicate her in
an Iranian plot for a cyber-attack
against the U.S..
The closure affected nearly
20,000 Venezuelan voters living
in Florida, Georgia, North Caro-
lina and South Carolina who had
registered to vote at the Miami
consulate. Most Venezuelan vot-
ers in the United States live in the
Miami area and the vast majority
of those are critical of the Chavez
government.
After the Miami mission
closed, Venezuelan election offi-
cials said that voters registered
there would have to cast bal-

lots in New Orleans, where the
next-nearest consulate is located.
Venezuelan opposition leaders
accused the government of try-
ing to disenfranchise voters, a
charge officials denied.
"They tried to do everything
possible to prevent us from vot-
ing," said Gisela Parra, a former
judge who left Venezuela in 2005
after being accused of conspiring
against Chavez. "The pressure
was such that they had to open
a voting center far away, in New
Orleans. It's like punishing us."
Parra, who plans to volunteer
at the New Orleans voting cen-
ter, said Venezuelan electoral
officials "had the obligation" to
make another Miami location
available.
But Tibisay Lucena, president
of Venezuela's Elections Council,
countered that voters registered
in Miami "were relocated using
the same criteria used inside the
country, telling them to go to the
nearest polling station."
About 15,800 Venezuelans in
the U.S. voted in their country's
Dec. 2006 presidential election,
three-quarters of them in Miami.
Of the 10,800 Venezuelans vot-
ingin Florida, 98 percent castbal-
lots for the opposition candidate
and 2 percent for Chavez. Thirty-
four percent of registered voters
did not participate, according to
figures from Venezuela's Elec-
tions Council.
Most Venezuelans in the U.S.
are professionals or business-
people who left their country
after Chavez became president
in 1999. The number of Venezu-
elans in the U.S. burgeoned from
91,500 in 2000 to 215,000 in
2010, according to the 2010 Cen-
sus, with 57 percent of them liv-
ing in Florida.
Numerous groups surfaced to
assist U.S.-based Venezuelan vot-
ers, with information distributed
on the Internet and social media,
as well as at coffee shops and
bookstores frequented by Ven-
ezuelans.
The groups include Voto Joven
and Voto Donde Sea, comprised
mostly of young people, and the
Mesa de la Unidad Democrati-
ca, or Democratic Unity Table,
a coalition of political parties
backing opposition presidential
candidate Henrique Capriles.

Beatriz Olavarria, who leadsa
commission created by the oppo-
sition alliance to distribute voter
information and mobilize observ-
ers, said she hopes at least half of
the voters registered in Miami
will cast ballots in New Orleans.
"Something tells me that many
people will. get on board at the
last minute," she said.
Olavarria, who has volun-
teered in Miami during past
Venezuelan elections, created
the website www.Miami7octu-
bre.com, to provide information
about the New Orleans vote.
The group's major push now
is figuring out how to get regis-
tered voters to the Louisiana city,
where balloting will be held in
a convention center. Opposition
members complain that voting
will not occur inside the mission
itself, but Lucena, the electoral
council president, said "the rules
state that the polling center must
be as near as possible to a consul-
ate."
In most cases, traveling from
here to New Orleans to vote
would require at least one night
away from home.
With travel costs a major
obstacle for many potential vot-
ers, financial adviser Andres
Casanova and his childhood
friend Andres Morrison are col-
lecting donations to pay for char-
ter planes to ferry Venezuelans to
New Orleans.
So far, they have received
almost $355,700 in donations,
enough to pay for trips for 1,100
voters. But far more people - as
many as 3,000 - have registered
on the organization's website,
www.aerovotar.com , for seats
assigned on a first-come, first-
served basis.
Voto Donde Sea, meanwhile, is
collecting donations to subsidize
bus fares for voters, said group
leader Vanessa Duran.
Milagros and Fernando Nunez
Noda are renting a car with
another couple to make the trip
from Miami.
"We're going no matter what,"
said Nunez Noda, a journalist
and businessman.
"It's like they threw down
a challenge," he said of the
government's decision to move
the balloting to New Orleans.
"We will prove our strength."

PITTSBURGH (AP) - The
Kremlin is watching, European
nations are rebelling, and some
suspect Moscow is secretly bank-
rolling a campaign to derail the
West's strategic plans.
It's not some Cold War movie;
it's about the U.S. boom in natu-
ral gas drilling, and the political
implications are enormous.
Like falling dominoes, the
drilling process called hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, is shaking
up world energy markets from
Washington to Moscow to Bei-
jing. Some predict what was once
unthinkable: that the U.S. won't
need to import natural gas in the
near future, and that Russia could
be the big loser.
"This is where everything is
being turned on its head," said
Fiona Hill, an expert on Russia at
the Brookings Institution, a think
tank in Washington. "Their days
of dominating the European gas
markets are gone."
Any nations that trade in ener-
gy could potentially gain or lose.
"The relative fortunes of the
United States, Russia, and China
- and their ability to exert influ-
ence in the world - are tied in no
small measure to globalgas devel-
opments," Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government
concluded in a report this sum-
mer.
The story began to unfold a few
years ago, as advances in drilling
opened up vast reserves of gas
buried in deep shale rock, such
as the Marcellus formation in
Pennsylvania and the Barnett, in
Texas.
Experts had been predicting
that the U.S. was running out of

natural gas, but then shale gas
began to flood the market, and
prices plunged. -
Russia had been exporting vast
quantities to Europe and other
countries for about $10 per unit,
but the current price in the U.S. is
now about $3 for the same quan-
tity. That kind of math got the
attention of energy companies,
and politicians, around the world.
Some European governments
began to envision a future with
less Russian natural gas. In 2009,
Russia had cut off gas shipments
via Ukraine for nearly two weeks
amid a price and payment dis-
pute, and more than 15 European
countries were sent scrambling to
find alternative sources of energy.
The financial stakes are huge.
Russia's Gazprom energy corpo-
ration, which is state-controlled,
had $44 billion in profits last year.
Gazprom, based in Moscow, is the
world's largest producer of natu-
ral gas and exports much of it to
other countries.
Butlastmonth Gazprom halted
plans to develop a new arctic gas
field, saying it couldn't justify
the investment now, and its most
recent financial report showed
profits had dropped by almost 25
percent.
.The U.S. presidential cam-
paigns have already addressed
the strategic potential.
A campaign position paper for
Republican Mitt Romney said he
"will pursue policies that work
to decrease the reliance of Euro-
pean nations on Russian sources
of energy."
In early September, President
Barack Obama said the U.S. could
"develop a hundred-year supply
of natural gas that's rightbeneath
our feet," which would "cut our
oil imports in half by 2020 and
support more than 600,000 new
jobs in natural gas alone."
Poland's Ministry of the Envi-
ronment wrote in a statement to
The Associated Press that "an


increased production of natu-
ral gas from shale formations in
Europe will limit the import via
pipelines from Algeria and Rus-
sia."
The issue has reached the
highest levels of the Kremlin, too.
Hill, of the Brookings think
tank, heard President Vladimir
Putin speak in late 2011 at a Mos-
cow gathering of academics and
media. She said in a blog post that
"the only time I thought that he
became truly engaged was when
he wanted to explain to us how
dangerous fracking was."
But one top Gazprom execu-
tive said shale gas will actu-
ally hglp the country in the long
run. Sergei Komlev, the head of
export contracts and pricing,
acknowledged the recent disrup-
tions but predicted that the U.S.
fuels wouldn't make their way to
Europe on any important scale.
"Although we heard that the
motive of these activities was to
decrease dependence of certain
countries on Gazprom gas, the
end results of these efforts will be
utterly favorable to us," Komlev
wrote in an email to the AP. "The
reason for remaining tranquil is
that we do not expect the cur-
rently abnormally low prices in
the USA to last for long."
In other words, if the market-
place for natural gas expands,
Russia will have even more
potential customers because it
has tremendous reserves.
Komlev even thanked the U.S.
for taking the role of "shale gas
global lobbyist" and said Gaz-
prom believes natural gas is more
environmentally friendly than
other fossil fuels.
"Gazprom group generally
views shale gas as a great gift to
the industry," he wrote. When
natural gas prices rise, "it will
make the U.S. plans to become a
major gas exporter questionable."
Whether exports happen
involves a dizzying mix of math,

Bill would provides IDs
for illegal immigrants

Officials speculate chief
justice will side with

Proposed Calif.
legislation would
r grant driver's
licenses
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
Some illegal immigrants
could get California drivers
licenses under a bill that Gov.
Jerry Brown announced he
signed into law late Sunday.
AB2189 by Assemblyman Gil
Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, will
let the Department of Motor
Vehicles issue licenses to illegal
immigrants eligible for work
permits under a new Obama
administration policy. The bill
requires the department to
accept as proof of legal-residence
whatever document the federal
government provides to partici-
pants in its deferred action pro-
gram.
Cedillo said his bill will make
roads safer while letting young
immigrants drive to school and
to work. His reasoning drew
support from several Repub-
lican lawmakers, while other
Republicans argued the state
should leave immigration issues
to the federal government.
"It is a victory for those who

must be renewed each semes-
ter.
Lynne Raughley, the interim
communications director for the
University's libraries, said the
program, which was developed
this summer; is valuable because
it increases access to resources
for students and faculty at both
institutions, noting the strength
of EMU's collection.
"It's always beneficial to have
access to more content," Raughley
said. "I think in most cases, stu-
dents are going to find what they
need at this library ... but to have
such a close by collection that
may have areas of strength that
we don't is certainly going to be a
bonus "
Paul Barrow, a library infor-
mation resources manager, said

American society," Cedillo said
in a statement.
He said California is the first
state to grant drivers' licenses
to the group singled out under
the Obama administration's
policy. Cedillo praised Brown
for choosing "public safety over
politics" by signing the bill.
"President Obama has recog-
nized the unique status of these
students, and making them eligi-
ble to apply for driver's licenses
is an obvious next step," Brown
spokesman Gil Duran said.
Meanwhile, Brown vetoed
AB1081, which could have pro-
tected illegal immigrants from
deportation if they committed
minor infractions. The bill has
been dubbed "anti-Arizona"
legislation, a reference to that
state's immigrant identification
law.
The so-called Trust Act
would have let California opt
out of some parts of a federal
program that requires local law
enforcement officers to check
the fingerprints of people they
arrest against a federal immi-
gration database and hold those
who are in the country illegally.
versity libraries, previously not
everyone had borrowing access,
and implementation of the new
program allows for better sharing
of resources.
"Whenever we can get infor-
mation out to people, it's benefi-
cial, and this helps to provide that
access," Barrow said.
Raughley said the new pro-
gram will assist students who pre-
viously had to utilize resources in
the other libraries, but could not
take the book with them.
"Extending borrowing privi-,
leges to a university so close is
just another way of making our
resources more available in a sort
of regional way," Raughley said.
Barrow said ultimately the pro-
gram will greatly aid students by
helping them receive the infor-
mation they need, noting that
students should be able to receive
their borrower cards quickly, usu-
ally in less than a day.
"Whenever we can get infor-
mation out to people, it's benefi-

It would have barred local
law enforcement officers from
detaining suspects for possible
deportation unless they are
charged with serious or violent
felonies.
Brown backed - compre-
hensive federal immigra-
tion reform, and said in a veto
message that federal agents
"shouldn't try to coerce local
law enforcement officials into
detaining people who've been
picked up for minor offenses
and pose no reasonable threat
to their community."
However, he said the list
of serious or violent felonies
in the bill is "fatally flawed
because it omits many serious
crimes." He said those include
child abuse, drug trafficking,
and weapons violations, among
others. He promised to work
with lawmakers to fix the bill's
wording.
California law enforcement
officials have turned over
about 80,000 illegal immi-
grants for deportation since
2009, though fewer than half
had committed a serious or
violent felony. The majority of
those deported by the federal
government under the Secure
Communities program have
come from California.
cial, and this helps to provide that
access," Barrow said.
He added that University stu-
dents that maybe concerned about
accessing books from a University
library that are reserved for EMU
students will not have to worry,
since the library can recall a book
if a University student requests it.
LSA freshman Becca Mulder
said she is glad the program is in
place and would use it if needed.
"It sounds like a great idea,"
Mulder said. "I would (use the
program) if they had the book that
I needed and U of M didn't."
LSA sophomore Logan Place
said he approves of the program
because it provides access to
books students might not have in
their own library. He said EMU's
proximity to the University also
makes the option more conve-
nient.
"There's the AATA bus system
and I also have a car, so it wouldn't
be too much of a problem to get
over there," Place said.

ideas and even go abroad to sup-
port the organization.
In an interview before the
event, Shah said it was especially
exciting for him to return to his
former college town. He added
that the organization is seeking
to recruit as many University stu-
dents as possible, citing the cre-
ation of the Peace Corps on the
steps of the Union as an example
of the spirit of service embed-
ded on campus. USAID was cre-
ated in 1961 by an executive order
issued by President John F. Ken-
nedy to aid civilians overseas.
Shah noted that the structure
of the University and the mindset
of its students help lead students
to careers in humanitarian aid.
"People thatgoto Michiganare
go-getters," he said. "You have to
be because it's such a big school,
and that's good training for life,
especially in this work, because if
you really want to make changes
you have to be proactive you can't
be afraid of bureaucracy."
Many of the attendees identi-
fied themselves as student activ-
ists with interests in pursuing
humanitarian careers, or profes-
sors seeking to complement their
activities at the University.
Andrew Haig, a professor of
physical medicine and rehabilita-
tion, said he attended the event
to supplement his work in low
resource countries.
Policy Talks

"I'mtryingtoget abetter sense
of how the University can work
with USAID in getting some of
their objectives done," he said.
"There are so many things that
we're really good at, that they
need help with. We have to finda
way to connect."
During the lecture, Shah cited
examples of USAID successes,
including partnerships with the
University of Michigan in Jor-
dan, and the advent of mobile
banking in remote areas.
Shah said despite the 900 mil-
lion people, including 170 million
children, around the world who
live in hunger, the future is not
bleak. He noted that the innova-
tion in the food industry, vacci-
nation development and vitamin
supplements are positively pro-
gressive and that he believes such
methods will help end prevent-
able child death by 2035.
"You might say governments
are too hard to work for or too
bureaucratic, or how are you
going to reach children an hour
away from a paved road?" he said
before the event. "People said all
of those things, but over the last
few years we've seen the biggest
decline in children dying under
the age of 5, and a 50 percent
reduction in child mortality."
Shah offered South Korea as
an example of the international
benefits USAID can yield, namely
in developing a trade relation-
ship.
"If we want to be a vibrant
economy in the future, we need
to try to replicate that story, in
fast-growing African countries,
in fast-growing communities in

case leave little doubt that Ken-
nedy, not Roberts, holds the
prized vote. The challengers of
the Texas program and the uni-
versity itself cite Kennedy's prior
writings on affirmative action a
combined 50 times.
The court also is expected
to confront gay marriage in.
some form. Several cases seek
to guarantee federal benefits
for legally married same-sex
couples. A provision of the
1996 Defense of Marriage Act
deprives same-sex couples of a
range of federal benefits avail-
able to heterosexual couples.
Several federal courts have
agreed. that the provision of
the law is unconstitutional,
a situation that practically
ensures that the high court
will step in.
A separate appeal asks the
justices to sustain California's
Proposition 8, the amendment
to the state constitution that
outlawed gay marriage in the
nation's largest state. Fed-
eral courts in California have
struck down the amendment.
Once again, many legal ana-
lysts expect Roberts essential-
ly to be against gay marriage.
Asia, and all around the world,"
Shah said.
He added that without'the aid,
chaos in fast-growing countries
generates ideal conditions for ter-
rorist groups, such as the Taliban
or al-Qaeda, to take power.
Shah said students interested
in international aid should pur-
sue an experience in the field,
regardlessof future career goals.
"It might work out and turn
into a career or it might not," he
said. "But either way it will be
deeply rewarding and I think
you'll learn something, as I did,
about how diverse, multifaceted
and connected our world is."
Jaclyn Sylvain, LSA junior and
president of ONE - an advocacy
group that pursues solutions to
poverty and disease in develop-
ing countries and co-sponsored
the event- said in an interview
after the event that she was pleas-
antly surprised with the turnout
at the event.
"I was very nervous walking
in because with crowd building
you never know what's going to
happen," she said. "But when I
walked in, it was completely full
and it made me so excited to see
that there was such a huge pres-
ence on campus of people who
are truly interested in this."
She added that listening to
Shah was inspiring and moti-
vational for students seeking to
serve others.
"It was nice to hear him speak
and to listen to his call to arms for
college students to get involved
and be active," shesaid. "I thinkit

explanation," Brown said.
"There was not a change in
enforcement action, and there
was not particularly a change in
tracking."
Not all individuals referred
for disciplinary action for alco-
hol or drug law violations con-
sumed substances. In most
cases, students in a group that is
confronted by Housing Security,
Residence Hall Staff, or other
officials for such activity are
referred for disciplinary action,
regardless of whether they con-
sumed alcohol or drugs.
The number of drug law vio-

lations remained essentially
unchanged with 126 drug arrests
or citations and 202 drug viola-
tions referred for disciplinary
action - both increases of less
than 5 percent from 2010. How-
ever, in comparison with the
2009 report, there were about
97 percent more drug citations
or arrests and about 162 percent
more drugviolations referred for
disciplinary action reported in
2011.
Brown said most students who
are cited or arrested. for alco-
hol, drug or weapon law viola-
tions are also referred to OSCR
for counseling and other disci-
plinary action. She added a hall
director or housing security offi-
cer holds the discretion for how

incidents in residence halls are
handled.
Looking ahead to future
reports, the new medical amnes-
ty law may complicate how alco-
hol law violations are handled.
The policy exempts intoxicated
individuals or people aiding ine-
briated friends from receiving
a Minor in Possession charge if
they contact emergency person-
nel.
Brown pointed out that stu-
dents who request amnesty are
individuals who need counsel-
ing most.
"Protocol is making sure
those students who end up going
to the hospital and requesting
amnesty still are referred for
disciplinary action so that they

can get some counseling and, or
some help," Brown said.
The report also documented
that 617 larcenies - thefts or
attempted thefts of unattended
possessions - were reported
in 2011, a decrease of about 26
percent from the 840 reported
in 2010.
Forcible sexual assault cases
also decreased from 2010, with
21 total reported to DPS, other
police agencies and non-police
in 2011.
In 2011, 44 cases of sexual
assault were reported to SAPAC,
while 50 were reported in 2010.
However, some of the SAPAC
cases may have also been
reported to police or may have
occurred before 2011 in areas

other than Ann Arbor. SAPAC
reported 11 cases of intimate
partner violence, 12 cases of
stalking and 7 incidents of sex-
ual harassment.
SAPAC is not required to
report individual cases to
police, but it does report them
in an anonymous, aggregated
chart.
SAPAC director Holly Rider-
Milkovich was not available for
comment over the weekend.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the Department of
Education requires the Univer-
sity to make the report available
to current and prospective stu-
dents, staff and faculty, but does
not mandate that the publica-
tion be printed.
ti

"It's required to be avail-
able for distribution," Brown
said. "There's not a prescribed
method yet for whether it must
be printed."
The report is currently avail-
able online and will be available
in print at the office of Depart-
ment of Public Safety, the
Central Student Government
offices, residence halls and sev-
eral administrative offices later
in October.
Additionally, the Beyond the
Diag neighborhood program
will also distribute copies of
the reports, and many printed
editions will be distributed to
new students and parents who

"If the First Amendment
means anything, it means that
the government cannot censor
speech just because it is contro-
versial, unpopular, or stirs peo-
ple's emotions," Korobkin wrote.
"That's what happened here."
Korobkin wrote that because
AATA receives public funding, it
is especially responsible for com-
plying with the First Amend-
ment.
"Because the AATA is a gov-
ernment agency, it has to com-
ply with the First Amendment,"
Korobkin wrote. "So once it
decides to run ads on its buses, it
cannot pick and choose between

the ads it likes and the ads it
doesn't like."
Korobkin added that the buses
have displayed ads for other con-
troversial issues before.
"It can't reject Mr. Coleman's
ad just because some people
don't like what he has to say,"
Korobkin wrote.
Korobkin noted that he thinks
Coleman should eventually be
able to place his advertisements
in the future.
"Now that the court has ruled
in favor of Mr. Coleman's First
Amendment rights, the AATA
should do the right thing and run
Mr. Coleman's ad just like it runs
hundreds of other ads," Korob-
kin said. "If it doesn't, the court
has invited further briefing on
what kind of court order should
issue."
Though Ann Arbor residents

may be disconcerted .by Cole-
man's proposed ad, Korobkin
wrote that the best response for.
people who disagree with Cole-
man's views on Israel is to simply
exercise their own freedom to
speak freely.
"Many people do not agree
with Mr. Coleman's views about
Israel, and some people find
those views deeply offensive,"
Korobkin said. "But the appro-
priate response is for those peo-
ple to use their First Amendment
rights to speak back. It is not
the government's role to censor
offensive speech."
AATA did not respond to mul-
tiple requests for comment over

with the turnout at the events
on other campuses," Woodhams
said. " ... It's a great way to make
sure their voice is heard on Elec-
tion Day."
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president of gov-
ernment relations, said the
efforts of the Secretary of State
are indicative of the state's
ongoing emphasis on the impor-
tance of voting in November.
"The use of these mobile
offices has been effective on col-
lege campuses," Wilbanks said.
"So it's been a wonderful part-
nership, and I think we've found
everyone to be very accommo-
dating."
In addition to serving as a
convenient and practical oppor-
tunity for students and commu-
nity members to register to vote,
Wilbanks said the mobile office
particularly resonates with her
personally.
"I'm of the generation that -
had turned 18 when 18 year
olds were first given the right to
vote," Wilbanks said. "So I use
my own set of experiences going
back to 1972 at Michigan and
remembering the excitement
about being registered for the
first time and casting my vote in
the 1972 election."
She added that the mobile
office, and efforts similar to it,
are critical to promoting par-

ticipation in democracy.
"What we want to do is
encourage civic participation
and civic engagement," Wil-
banks said. "The voting process
is a very important part of what
we hope students will carry
(with them) the rest of their
lives and that's a significant
level of civic engagement."
Along with giving students a
practical opportunity to register
to vote, the mobile office helped
to promote campus organiza-
tions that are also working to
encourage student involvement
in the election, Wilbanks said.
"This visit also helps to give
visibility to the other voter reg-
istration activities that are on,
campus," Wilbanks said. "There
are lots of student organiza-
tions, like Central Student Gov-
ernment and Voice your Vote,
that are important campus-led
activities ... that are also very
much aligned with the goals of
getting as many people to reg-
ister to vote and eventually to
vote."
Rackham student Kimberly
Reyes said convenience was a
major factor in her visit to the
mobile office, and she was glad
to have the chance to take care
of multiple things at once.
"I'm a graduate student and
I'm super busy all the time,"
Reyes said. "Not only did I have
to register to vote for this elec-
tion, but I also had to renew
my license plates and take care
of life stuff, so it does help to

have it here and I can do it all at
once."
LSA senior Sarah Awad-Farid
said the proximity of the mobile
office to campus and lack of fol-
low-up procedures was particu-
larly helpful.
"I think this is a great oppor-
tunity for students to be able to
register to vote," Awad-Farid
said. "It's convenient for me, and
honestly, it's a great way to make
sure, as a student, you are exer-
cising your rights."
The face-to-face interaction
with the mobile office work-
ers was also beneficial to help
first-time voters prepare for the
election, LSA sophomore Jonah
Sementkowski said.
"The instructions online
weren't very efficient or help-
ful," Sementkowski said. "I
didn't understand what I need-
ed to do for the absentee ballot,
so it's nice that this is here."
Annette Lozon, a University
government relations associ-
ate, said the event is not only
an opportunity for students
to exercise their right to vote,
but also a reminder about the
importance of the election.
"It's one more touch point to
the community as a reminder
that an election is coming,"
Lozon said. "So maybe you
already are registered to vote
and you've got everything you
need and you're set, but it's one
more reminder about those bal-
lot proposals, to take the time to
look atthem."

Ezurike finishes it in 20T

The Michigan Ultras stormed
the field Sunday night after
Michigan eked out a final-min-
ute overtime victory over Ohio
State.
Freshman defender Jack
Roberts launched a 60-yard
free kick into the net through
the shielded hands of Ohio State
goalie Alex Ivanov to secure a
3-2 victory for the Wolverines.

After a similar heartbreak-
ing loss in Columbus last year,
Michigan (1-1 Big Ten, 3-5
overall) managed to get some
revenge on the Buckeyes (0-2,
4-6-1), as both squads were still
searching for their first confer-
ence win and hoping to move a
step closer to the .500 mark.

After missing opportunity
after opportunity, the No. 22
Michigan women's soccer team
found the back of the net when it
mattered most Sunday.
Less than a minute into the
second overtime period, junior
forward Nkem Ezurike buried a
short-range shot, propelling the
Wolverines (4-0-1 Big Ten, 10-2-
1 overall) over Nebraska, 2-1.
Ten minutes away from con-
secutive disappointing ties at

home, Ezurike's golden goal won
the game for Michigan. Chas-
ing a long ball into the Corn-
huskers' 18-yard box, the junior
overpowered Nebraska defender
Maritza Hayes and stripped her
of the ball. Taking a quick look
at net, Ezurike fired the ball past
the charging goalkeeper for her
sixth goal of the season.
"It wasn't an easy win,"
Ezurike said. "(The goal) means
a lot."
The victory helped Michigan
maintain sole possession of sec-
ond place in the Big Ten, behind

No. 8 Penn State (5-0, 10-2-0).
Sophomore defender Chloe
Sosensko's goal put Michigan
on the board in the 72nd minute.
Pushing up for acorner kick; she
fired a shot past Nebraska goal-
keeper Emma Stevens. The ball
screamed untouched past a maze
of legs before finding the back of
the net to give Michigan a 1-0
advantage.
But that lead didn't last long.
Just 41 seconds later, Nebraska
forward Mayme Conroy did
what few have done against
Michigan this year - score.

Unmarked in the six-yard
box, Conroy headed a rebound
past fifth-year senior netminder
Haley Kopmeyer, pulling the
Cornhuskers even. The goal was
the first surrendered by Kopr
meyer and the Wolverines in
more than 632 consecutive min-
utes of play, and only the second
allowed at home all season.
Early on, Nebraska dictated
the pace at the U-M Soccer Com-
plex. The Cornhuskers exploited
holes in the Michigan defense,
forcing Kopmeyer into -action.

Open house shows

Michigan speeds past Badgers

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
For years the Michigan hock-
ey team and its fans have prided
themselves on calling Yost Ice
Arena - considered by some to be
the toughest environment in col-
lege hockey - its home.
When the third-ranked Wol-
verines face off against Windsor
in an exhibition game on Oct. 9,
they'll still be playing in Field-
ing Yost's old barn. But this time
around, they'll be on a new rink,
surrounded by new bleachers,
boxes and concourses.
Yost's face-lift is part of the
Athletic Department's planned
$250-million renovations to
South Campus and the Univer-
sity's athletic facilities. A large
scoreboard made its debut at the
beginning of the Wolverines'
2011-12 campaign. The remain-
der of the renovations didn't start
until after the conclusion of the
season last spring, and the chang-
es finally finished this past week
when the new ice was laid down.
On Sunday afternoon, an open
house hosted by the Athletic

Department afforded the public
its first look at the new Yost. Sea-
son ticket holders had the oppor-
tunity to pick up their tickets and
view the extended concourses
while meandering through the
luxury boxes at the upper levels
of the arena.
But the mostnoticeable change
comes from the addition of win-
dows at the north and south end
of the arena. The windows were
added to allow more natural light
into the arena and to create a
more welcoming atmosphere for
fans, according to the Athletic
Department. Whereas the stands
felt boxed-in before, the windows
and light create a more airy sense
of space for the spectators. Addi-
tional improvements include new
bleachers, an enhanced audio sys-
tem and a new press box.
When Michigan coach Red
Berenson announced his three-
year contract extension in July,
he cited Yost's renovations as
part of his incentive to continue
coaching. This is the fourth reno-
vation the arena has undergone
with Berenson at the helm of the
hockey program.

winning streak on Saturday

consin, MICHIGAN 172.5
172.5-
115.5, at Canham Natatorium.

The Wolverines have now won
44 of their last 45 openers.
Michigan got on top early,
placing first and second in the
opening 200-meter heat. From
that point on, the Wolverines
kept the lead throughout the
length of the event.
The freestyle events proved
to be the strength of the team,
with each final finishing with
a Wolverine swimmer in first

and second place - and often in
third and fourth to sweep the
heat. The men's 100-meter free-
style and 200-meter individual
medley ended with Michigan
swimmers claiming every top-
four position.
The 1,000-meter freestyle
belonged to junior Connor Jae-
ger.
From the stands, Jaeger
might look like every other

swimmer. With a closer look,
the black Olympic ring tat-
too is just barely visible across
his left shoulder blade. Jae-
ger returned from London in

the 1,500-meter freestyle final.

Nothing builds a brand better than winning

It's been a while since Michi-
gan athletics have been so
alive.
That realization came a few
months ago. I was seated in the
sun-drenched plaza of Market
Square in downtown Pittsburgh,
across the table from J. Brady
McCollough, a sports enterprise
writer for the Pittsburgh Post
Gazette and a former Daily
sports writer (2001-04).
"Michigan is cool again,"
Brady said.
It took a minute to sink
in. Cool again? That means it
dropped out
of favor at
some point,
then, right?
Right.
To the avid
Michigan fol-
lower, Michi-
gan athletics
never left the STEPHEN J.
spotlight. NESBITT
To everyone -
else - the
alum, the casual fan, the pundit
- Michigan lost its "cool."
The football program plum-
meted from national prominence
after Rich-Rodriguez replaced
Lloyd Carr. The men's basketball
team, mired in years of mediocri-
ty and controversy, couldn't find
its footing and never rose back to
its elite status of the early 1990s.
The hockey program? Well, to be
fair, that never left.
Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon is a brand man.
He was a top-flightbusiness-
man and CEO before he took
over as athletic director in 2010,
and Brandon has turned Michi-
gan athletics on its head. New
buildings. New programs. New'
jerseys.

ment's success hinge merely on
the ranking of three teams? No
chance. Michigan has 27 varsity
sports this fall - focusing on
three programs would be consid-
ering just a drop in a bucket.
But it says a lot.
It says that, despite the current
2-2 record, Michigan football
is right on the brink of where it
wants to be. On the dawn of Big .
Ten play, the Wolverines are pre-
pared for a dog-fight to win the
conference - the team's stated
goal for the last two seasons.
It says that, as the winningest
program in college hockey,
Michigan hockey keeps earning
its respect. It can contend with
the Ontario Hockey League and
players' professional aspirations
while buildinga program that
competes year after year at the
highest level.
It says that, with scandal and
weak rosters now in the review
mirror, John Beilein and the
Michigan men's basketball team
have a lineup that can be a serious
contender on the national stage.
Freshman Mitch McGary and
some of the nation's top recruits
think Michigan is cool again.
So, when you take your next
pilgrimage to the gates of Michi-
gan Stadium, Crisler Center or
Yost Ice Arena this fall, stop for a
moment and take a deep breath.
Look at the state-of-the-art
facilities, the bright lights and the
flashy new jerseys. Embrace what
you like, scorn what you don't.
But then take a look at the
product on the court, on the turf,
on the ice.
Pretty cool, isn't it? And this
year is just gettingstarted.
- Nesbitt can be reached
at stnesbitiumich.edu.

Michigan Stadium has stood witness tothe winningest program in college football for the better part of a century. That success stands as much of its legacy.

It's a different look, a different
brand, abetter Michigan.
But even a marketing guru
like Brandon knows that noth-
ing changes a brand faster than
success. And Michigan wasn't
winning.
The football, men's basket-
ball and hockey programs - the
headlining high-income teams
for the Michigan Athletic
Department - haven't simulta-
neously excelled in any year in
recent memory, and that has hurt
Michigan's brand.
But there's something differ-
ent about this fall. That history
is all but forgotten. Michigan is

back on the rise. And hold your board, ranging anywhere from

The No. 17 Michigan field

a 7-1 victory over Pacific on Fri-

ing back
from a loss to No. 6 Penn State
in State College last weekend,
the Wolverines returned to
Ann Arbor to defeat the Tigers
to remain unbeaten at home
this season. Michigan created
numerous scoring chances and
carried the majority of posses-
sion throughout the game.
"I was happy with how we
came out, stayed focused and
followed the game plan," said

Michigan coach Marcia Pan-
kratz. "That was really good.
And I think a game like this is
good for younger players to gain
experience."
Sophomore midfielder Axelle
Wouters gave the Wolverines
the early lead, scoring her fourth
goal of the season just over six
minutes into the game. The 1-0
lead would only be temporary,
though. Pacific responded with
a goal of its own just 20 seconds
later to tie the game.
The 1-1 deadlock wasn't indic-
ative of the remainder of the
game, as Michigan took control
of the game and wouldn't relin-
quish it.
Freshman defender Aisling
Naughton scored the second goal
of the game 17:30 into the match
off of an assist from junior for-

ward Michelle Roberts. Shortly
after, Roberts was able to be on
the scoring end of the goal, capi-
talizing on an assist from junior
forward Rachael Mack. Keeping
the pressure on the Tigers, Mack
got agoal of her own, off an assist
from freshman midfielder Taryn
Mark.
The emphasis on fundamen-
tals was a big contributor to
three Michigan goals in under
five minutes.
"We started playing two-
touch hockey and we went back
to basics and simple passes and
the simple ball into space, and
I thought that worked well,"
Naughton said.
Coming out of halftime, the
Wolverines continued to con-
trol the play but were unable to
translate the momentum into

Despite rocky summer, 'M'
ready for blockbuster fall

By PETER DENNIS
For the Daily
For a team that practiced
without a coach all summer, the
Michigan women's swimming
and diving team is doing just fine.
Under normal circumstances,
a team with 10 seniors would be
considered a veteran squad, one
with enough experience to help
the 10 new freshmen. But fol-
lowing the retirement of long-
time women's head coach Jim
Richardson, the team was held
in limbo, balancing its lack of a
coach with the necessity of pre-
paring for its upcoming season.
Mike Bottom, also the men's
swimming and diving coach, was
hired to coach both teams and
juggle the responsibility of both
sides after having led the men's
team for the past four seasons.
"They sat all summer not
knowing who the coach would
be," Bottom said. "But as soon as
the decision was made, they came
right in and gave 100 percent sup-
port behind us, even though we
hadn't hired our staff yet."
With such a large both incom-
ing and outgoing class, the team
really came together as a unit.
"The truth is, they're all fresh-
men to us," Bottom said. "To the
coaching staff, they're all fresh-
men. And that's the exciting thing
- they're all as excited about
coming here as freshmen. Their
eyes are all wide, and whenever
I talk to the group, they're just
EZURIKE
From Page lB
In the ninth minute, she made
a diving save on a long-range
shot. A minute later, Kopmeyer
sprinted off her line to cut down
the angle on a breakaway, forcing
the Nebraska attacker to send a
shot wide. Disappointed with the
effort, Michigan coach Greg Ryan
delivered a stern message to his
team at halftime.

ming in dual meets, you never
know what's going to happen,"
Jaeger said. "In-season swim-
ming is so unpredictable, you
can never be too comfortable
goinginto any race or any meet."
With only eight seniors on
the team, freshmen will look to
juniors such as Jaeger and cap-
tain Jack Lee - who placed first
in both the one- and three-
meter dives - for guidance
and leadership. The fresh-
man class is now the biggest
class on the team, with 14 new
swimmers and one new diver.
"The freshman stepped up
today," Jaeger said. "Two of
them particularly swam really
well: Dylan Bosch and Peter
Brumm. I don't want to just
call those out. I think as a class
they did a great job."
Michigan swimming coach
Mike Bottom agreed that Bosch
is a headlining addition to the
program. Bosch came in first
for the 100-meter fly at 48.92
seconds and the 200-meter fly
at 1:46.77.
On the diving board, fresh-
man Timothy Faerber combated

an injured back.

any goals until Naughton added
another goal off of an assist from
Roberts. Six minutes later, fresh-
man defender Jaime Dean scored
her first collegiate goal off of an
assist from Mark. Rounding out
the scoring for Michigan was
redshirt sophomore defender
Leslie Smith, who scored off of a
penalty stroke.
Given the sizeable lead, the
Wolverines were able to give sev-
eral starters some rest and give
younger players some valuable
epperience.
Pankratz applauded the play-
ers for their concentration in the
-afternoon game after a day of
classes.
"It's not always easy playing
on Friday," said Pankratz. "The
girls have class all day long so
they are racing around, and it's

hard fouls and frequent banter
in the first 15 minutes.
Neither side was able to
generate many quality scoring
chances, as the teams constant-
ly swapped possession through-
out the first half. The lack of
opportunities didn't seem to
faze the Wolverines, though.
"Sometimes you have to feel
it out," said Michigan coach
Chaka Daley. "I think it was
the nerves. In a rivalry game,
everyone is so excited."
Finally, in the 34th minute
Michigan junior midfielder
Ezekiel Harris found the back
of the net with a powerful head-
er off a corner kick from junior
midfielder Fabio Pereira, for his
first goal of the season.-
"Both teams tried to settle in
and once we finally did break
through, I thought it was a good
time for the goal," Daley said.
Five minutes later, the Buck-
eyes had a set play of their own
as senior Austin McAnena lined
up behind the ball. His cross
into Michigan's 18-yard box
found the foot of senior Chris
Hegngi, who struck it home for
the equalizing goal.
The half finished tied ,at
one apiece, as the Buckeyes
regained momentum.
But the Wolverines came out
strong to start the second half,
controlling possession in the
offensive half and constructing
several scoring opportunities.
"I just told them to stay the
course," Daley said. "It's a
major game. Everyone is excit-
ed and we had so much energy
the entire game."
In the 60th minute, Michi-

hard to herd them all in and get
focused for a game. So I was
happy with the way we came out
and stayed focused and followed
the game plan."
Michigan outshot Pacific by
a tally of 31-2 and also led them
in corners, 8-2. The Wolverines
hope Friday's offensive produc-
tion will continue into the rest of
the BigTen schedule.
"(Scoring goals) definitely
boosts our confidence, because
when you see the ball going into
the net, it's so much better than
seeing it go wide," Naughton
said. "And you can actually say
what we're doing in practice
makes it go in."
The Wolverines will have a
week to practice before they take
on conference foe Northwestern
on Oct. 5 at Ocker Field.
gan's effort to begin the second
half fell short, as the Wolver-
ines suffered an own goal as
Harris accidentally kicked the
ball in his own net and put the
Buckeyes in front.
"On a long, precise throw in,
you have to make sure that they
don't win it," Daley said. "We
won it but unfortunately it went
off our guy and into the net."
Directly off the ensuing kick-
off, Michigan responded. Off a
rebound inside the box, Pereira
was there to rifle his team's sec-
ond goal into the bottom left
corner of the net.
"We change the game after
we get scored on," Pereira
said. "We can't just go down
on ourselves. I think the quick
response was why we stuck
with the game."
The Wolverines and the
Buckeyes exchanged fouls and
yellow cards the rest of the
half, but neither side had many
chances.
Michigan controlled the final
20 minutes of the game, leading
up to one of the crazier finishes
in recent memory.
With less than a minute
remaining in the second over
time period, Roberts launched a
ball toward the net. It went in,
right through Ivanov's hands.
It was just like last year, but
the Wolverines were on the
winning side of this extra time
thriller.
Roberts found it difficult to
explain the emotions surround-
ing the victory and his first-
career goal.
"At least in my sports career
this is probably the greatest
feeling ever," Roberts said. "It
can definitely turn our season
around to come back and win
like that."

Junior Angela Chokran took first in two events vs. Wisconsin on Friday.

lapping it up, they want more.
And what a great place to be as a
coach."
By virtue of the vacancy of the
coaching position, the Wolver-
ines were forced to rely on each
other to come together.
"It's definitely nice having that
10 (seniors) and 10 (freshman),"
said freshman. Zoe Mattingly.
"Not only the seniors have been
helping, but every grade has been
helping us out, helpingus prepare
for meets."
With so much of the team hav-
ing experience at higher levels
of competition, including eight
swimmers (three seniors, two
juniors and three freshmen) com-
peting at the U.S. Olympic Tri-
als this summer in Omaha, Neb.,
both the team's freshman and
upperclassman experience shone
though in its win versus Wiscon-
sin on Saturday. Leading only
by one point going into the 200-

yard individual medley, late entry
junior Melissa Lang and fresh-
man Marni Oldershaw followed
up junior Courtney Beidler,
sweeping the event. Michigan's
sweep dealt the Badgers a death
blow.
Freshman Ali DeLoof placed
first in the 100-yard backstroke
and fellow freshman Jessica Wolf
led Wolverine swimmers in the
1,000-yard freestyle. Mattingly
paired with senior Deirdre Jones
to finish second and third respec-
tively in the 200-yard butterfly.
"It was a great opportunity to
be (at the U.S Olympic Trials),"
Mattingly said. "It really shows
you a completely different stage.
It was nice because Michigan
was there as well so I got to be
with them and see how they han-
dled a meet like that. I think it's.
definitely helped me prepare for
meets like this and hopefully the
Big Tens and possibly NCAAs."

"We had to execute better," he ous missed opportunities, Ryan

said.
For the remainder of the game,
the Wolverines did just that.
In the 58th minute, fifth-year
senior midfielder Clare Satchel
got behind the defense for a
breakaway, but Stevens made
a sliding save. Minutes later,
Ezurike pushed the ball past Ste-
vens, but her off-balance effort
was rejected by a defender at the
goal line.
Because of Michigan's numer-

was relieved to escape with a vic-
tory.
"It was a challenging perfor-
mance," he said. "We're going to
keep working on how to break
down teams."
For now, though, Ryan said he
will take the result.
"We got better at breaking
them down over the course of the
game," he said. "I'm pleased that
they dug in and found a way to
win."

Michigan unable to mount upset vs. Huskers

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
The Michiganvolleyball team
