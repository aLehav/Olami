After 
over 
two 
years 
of 

deliberation, 
research 
and 

engagement 
with 
community 

members, 
the 
President’s 

Commission on Carbon Neutrality 
released its final 104-page report 
on March 18. The document 
outlines 
50 
recommendations 

for the University of Michigan’s 
three campuses to achieve net 
zero carbon emissions by 2040 
as part of efforts to combat the 
ongoing climate crisis. None of 
the recommendations are binding 
— instead, they must now be 
approved by University President 
Mark Schlissel and the Board of 
Regents.

Schlissel 
announced 
the 

creation of the PCCN in February 
2019. 
The 
announcement 

followed considerable activism 
from students, who called on 
the University to take action to 
mitigate climate change. The 
commission, 
co-chaired 
by 

Engineering professor Stephen 
Forrest 
and 
Law 
professor 

Jennifer 
Haverkamp, 
consists 

of faculty, staff and alumni 
from 
across 
the 
University’s 

departments and was created to 
develop a set of recommendations 
to achieve carbon neutrality.

The commissioners set multiple 

goals outlining the path to carbon 
neutrality within three targeted 
scopes of carbon emissions. Scope 
1 includes the University’s direct 
emissions, including those from 
the University power plant, the 
transportation and bus fleet on 
the campuses and emissions from 
boilers in University buildings. 
Scope 2 emissions derive from 
University off-campus electricity 
and “purchased power.” Scope 
3 
emissions 
are 
indirectly 

attributed to the University and 
include commuting to campus and 
food procurement on campus.

The final report maintains 

the targets of achieving carbon 
neutrality on Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions by 2025 and achieving 
Scope 3 carbon neutrality by no 
later than 2040.

The final recommendations 

were initially supposed to be 
released 
in 
December 
2020 

— instead, a draft report was 
released and community members 
were invited to respond, with 

some unsatisfied by what they 
considered 
the 
University’s 

unambitious 2040 end goal and 
reliance on carbon offsets. More 
than 521 comments were submitted 
to the commission responding 
to the draft recommendations. 
The 
commission 
also 
hosted 

community 
forums 
with 
the 

Planet Blue Ambassador Program 
and the Student Sustainability 
Coalition in January to engage 
with stakeholders and solicit 
additional feedback.

Using carbon offsets

According 
to 
the 
report, 

meeting the proposed emissions 
targets will depend heavily on 
the use of carbon offsets. This is 
a strategy in which the University 
would balance their greenhouse 
gas output by investing in carbon 
reduction or sequestration that 
would occur off-campus. Activists 
have 
long 
criticized 
carbon 

offsets, arguing they let wealthy 
institutions essentially pay to emit 
more carbon and do not directly 
cut 
an 
organization’s 
carbon 

output. 

The 
ADVANCE 
Program 
is 

a “critical and evidence-based” 
component of the University of 
Michigan’s diversity, equity and 
inclusion 
initiatives, 
according 

to 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald. 
Through 
workshops, 

trainings, consultations and annual 
reports, ADVANCE synthesizes data 
about the University’s climate and 
conducts research on demographics 
among faculty and staff to ensure the 
“success of a diverse and excellent 
faculty.” 

ADVANCE 
also 
provides 

resources like a handbook for 
faculty searches and hiring, as 
well as support for faculty from 
underrepresented 
backgrounds 

through identity-based networks, 
among other programs.

A Michigan Daily investigation 

of the ADVANCE program found 
numerous previously undisclosed 
allegations 
of 
discrimination, 

ranging from 2012 to 2020, in an 
allegedly toxic workplace with high 
staff turnover. 

In interviews with The Daily, 12 

former ADVANCE employees — 
ten who quit or left, and two who 
were fired in the past four years — 
alleged that ADVANCE’s workplace 
environment hinders its ability to 
engage in meaningful diversity, 
equity and inclusion work. 

Documents obtained by The 

Daily also indicate that employees 
repeatedly raised their concerns 
about discrimination and racism to 
program leadership and University 
administration over the past five 
years. In one instance, an employee 
alleging discrimination was offered 
a non-disparagement clause after 
her 
position 
was 
terminated 

and she brought her concerns to 
administrators.

When 
asked 
to 
comment 

on whether the University or 
ADVANCE leadership was aware 
of internal climate issues over the 
past five years, Fitzgerald wrote 
in an email to The Daily on Feb. 
25 that these concerns may have 

been shared anonymously and that 
ADVANCE is working to support its 
employees.

“There also may be instances 

where 
concerns 
are 
either 

not 
reported 
or 
are 
reported 

anonymously, which can limit any 
unit’s ability to respond,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “The current leadership team 
and staff of the ADVANCE program 
is looking to the future and focusing 
on ways that it can continue to carry 
out its mission of supporting the 
recruitment, 
retention, 
climate, 

and leadership development for 
a diverse and excellent faculty 
based on research and evaluation; 
knowledge and skill development; 
community building; and resources 
and support.”

“There was no one to really have 

your back”

The 
University’s 
ADVANCE 

Program was born out of a 2001 
National Science Foundation grant 
that aimed to increase the number of 
female-identifying faculty in science, 
technology, engineering and math 
and to promote gender equity among 
women at the University overall. 
The University was among the first 
nine higher education institutions 
to receive the NSF grant — between 
2001 and 2007, it received nearly $4 
million total.

The NSF grant ended in 2007, 

but ADVANCE continued to grow. 
Jennifer Linderman, professor in 
the College of Engineering and 
former associate dean for graduate 
education, 
became 
director 
in 

March 2016. She currently oversees 
the program along with Shelly 
Conner, director of research and 
evaluation, and Associate Directors 
Cynthia Hudgins and Isis Settles. 
(Conner replaced Janet Malley, 
previous director of research and 
evaluation, this past year.) 

Linderman referred The Daily 

to Fitzgerald when reached for 
comment for this article. Both 
Malley and Hudgins declined to 
comment when contacted by The 
Daily. Conner was not employed 
by ADVANCE when any of the 12 
employees that The Daily spoke to 

worked there, and all employees 
stressed that they had no issues with 
Settles.

According to the University’s 

2020-2021 Budget Detail, ADVANCE 
received almost $2.3 million last 
year, making it one of the most 
well-funded 
programs 
overseen 

by the Provost and Executive Vice 
President for Academic Affairs. 
This is more than twice the amount 
issued to the Office of Institutional 
Equity, which investigates sexual 
misconduct claims and other claims 
of discrimination.

Fitzgerald wrote in the Feb. 25 

email to The Daily that ADVANCE’s 
focus on faculty distinguishes it 
from programs run by the Office of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, as 
the latter also includes issues related 
to student diversity.

“The original focus of ADVANCE 

was to increase the presence of 
women faculty in STEM fields,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “That focus has 
been expanded to include a broader 
definition of diversity among the 
faculty and all areas of research and 
teaching on campus. But its focus 
continues to be on university faculty. 
That’s different from the DEI office, 
for 
example, 
which 
addresses 

all members of the university 
community – students, faculty and 
staff.”

In 
particular, 
ADVANCE 

produces 
reports 
that 
use 

institutional 
data 
to 
highlight 

gender and race gaps among faculty. 

The most recent reports focused on 
faculty equity during the COVID-19 
pandemic as well as exit interviews 
as a way of understanding job 
satisfaction and reasons for faculty 
departure. 

According to a 2019 report created 

by ADVANCE, ADVANCE programs 
have “positively influenced” the 
increase in faculty diversity and 
representation since 2002. 

But within ADVANCE, reports 

of staff dissatisfaction have been left 
seemingly unaddressed by program 
directors, according to the former 
employees who spoke with The 
Daily.

In a 2017 survey mandated as part 

of the University’s DEI Five-Year 
Strategic Plan and obtained by The 
Daily, 50% of ADVANCE employees 
said they were dissatisfied or very 
dissatisfied by the program’s climate 
and environment, compared to 
an average of 21% for staff across 
all 49 units at the University who 
responded to the survey. 40% of 
ADVANCE respondents also said 
they experienced some form of 
discrimination in the past 12 months 
at work — a percentage considerably 
higher than the 15% University-wide 
total. 

ADVANCE leadership received 

the final report in December 2017, 
according to the copy obtained 
by The Daily. All 10 ADVANCE 
employees employed at the time 
responded to the survey.

Craig Smith, former ADVANCE 

employee and current University 
library 
assessment 
specialist, 

worked at ADVANCE from Dec. 
2014 to May 2018 as a member of the 
research & evaluation team when 
the internal climate survey took 
place. Smith recalled that program 
leadership was hesitant to discuss 
the results of the survey after they 
were sent to employees.

Smith said that a group of 

employees met in January 2018 and 
drafted a list of requests for program 
leadership to address the report’s 
results — specifically the part that 
showed that 50% were dissatisfied 
or very dissatisfied with the office’s 
internal climate. 

“We had a meeting as a group 

to talk about (this result), and the 
director would only budget a half-
hour for the meeting and initially 
didn’t want to talk about that result 
at all and wanted to just talk about 
campus-wide results,” Smith said. 
“And so we had to ask her specifically 
to start addressing the climate at 
ADVANCE.”

On Jan. 16, 2018, Smith met 

with Linderman and read to her 
a seven-page document he had 
written describing incidents of 
perceived 
discrimination 
and 

racism at ADVANCE, according to 
Smith. Another former ADVANCE 
employee confirmed to The Daily 
that they saw this document in 2018; 
The Daily has also reviewed this 
document.

Smith said while Linderman 

agreed to take these claims seriously, 
he never saw them followed up on or 
discussed after this initial meeting. 
Smith also alleged that ADVANCE 
leadership tried to undermine the 
survey results by saying they only 
reflected the opinions of a small 
group of employees. 

“The director of ADVANCE was 

saying that those results were just 
the result of disgruntled employees 
who had already left,” Smith said. 
“But the fact of the matter is that 
people left because of the climate 
there. And so she was dismissing, 
in some ways, the climate itself by 
saying that people who weren’t 
happy left and now it’s fine.”

Another 
former 
ADVANCE 

employee, who asked to remain 
anonymous due to fear of retaliation, 
also worked at ADVANCE in the 
years leading up to the internal 
report. This employee corroborated 
many of Smith’s claims. In this 
article, they will be referred to as 
Alex. 

Alex said that many of the climate 

issues 
at 
ADVANCE 
stemmed 

from microaggressions — small, 
seemingly mundane conversations 
or tones of voice that made the 
office a hostile place for employees, 
particularly people of color. They 
said that apart from anonymous 
surveys like the mandated internal 
DEI report, it was difficult to give 
voice to these microaggressions 
given 
the 
small 
size 
of 
the 

organization. 

“People 
were 
excited 
when 

the (University-wide) DEI survey 
happened because it felt like the 
first time where people could shine 
a light on some of the issues taking 
place within the ADVANCE office,” 
Alex said.

But even with the DEI survey, 

Alex said tackling these issues was 
difficult because of how small and 
hierarchical ADVANCE is.

“It was frustrating because you 

felt very silenced, because you 
didn’t have the numbers,” Alex said. 
“We’re the ones doing the work for 
the rest of the University. There was 
no one to really have your back if you 
had issues.”

Fitzgerald confirmed that an all-

staff meeting took place in January 
2018 to discuss the survey results. 
According to Fitzgerald, this was 
followed by individual meetings 
between ADVANCE employees and 
outside consultants in 2019, where 
employees had the opportunity 
to discuss these results as well as 
their issues with the climate at 
ADVANCE. 

“There 
have 
been 
many 

additional staff discussions since, 
as the ADVANCE staff has worked 
to ensure that the unit’s climate is 
inclusive, equitable and respectful 
for all,” Fitzgerald wrote in his Feb. 
25 email.

Commission on Carbon Neutrality 
publishes final report, hands off task of 
reducing emissions to administration
After two years of deliberation and research, PCCN 
recommends achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040

ARJUN THAKKAR &

 CHRISTIAN JULIANO

Daily Staff Reporters

The virtual opening ceremony 

for Asian American and Pacific 
Islander Heritage Month began 
March 17 with a discussion about 
rediscovering cultural identities 
as well as anti-Asian racism in 
the wake of the Georgia massage 
parlor shootings in which eight 
people were killed, most of whom 
were Asian women. The shootings 
sparked discussion over the long 
history of anti-Asian racism and 
violence in the United States and 
rise in hate crimes against Asian 
Americans due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, 
particularly 
against 

women.

Over 40 participants attended 

the opening ceremony, including 
the 
creators 
of 
“Continental 

Shifts,” a podcast aiming to explore 
Samoan and Filipino-American 
identities by discussing education, 
politics, union organizing and hip-
hop. 

This event was hosted by the 

AAPI Heritage Month Planning 
Committee in coordination with 
the Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 

Affairs. 
It 
was 
co-sponsored 

by the United Asian American 
Organizations and the APID/A 
Staff Association. 

Public Health junior Victoria 

Minka, 
student 
coordinator 

for the AAPI Heritage Month 
planning 
committee, 
began 

by acknowledging March 16’s 
shootings. 

Minka 
emphasized 
the 

prevalence 
of 
xenophobia 
in 

the United States before asking 
attendees to honor a moment of 
silence for the individuals who 
were killed March 16, as well as 
others who have lost their lives due 
to hate crimes and racist violence. 

“This violence is not new to us,” 

Minka said. “There is a pattern of 
xenophobia and racism towards 
Asian Americans that only feels 
like it’s beginning to be recognized 
by the American public. We 
know its history, and we feel the 
reverberations of this pain.”

Many students commented in 

the chat that they came to this 
event to be with a safe, comfortable 
and supportive community. Many 
others said they came to offer 
support.

Gabriel Tanglao and Estella 

Owoimaha-Church, 
hosts 
of 

“Continental Shifts,” began with 
acknowledgments that the places 
they were Zooming from — New 
Jersey and California — were 
stolen 
Indigenous 
lands 
and 

recognized the tribes native to that 
land. 

While 
discussing 
Tuesday’s 

shootings, 
Owoimaha-Church 

shared various Samoan proverbs 
that create space for kindness and 
community. 

The two said their podcast 

originated when they met at a 
leadership event and connected 
over their curiosity about their 
heritage, which eventually became 
the project’s focus. 

“It’s really about wayfinding and 

self-reflection along our journey in 
the diaspora,” Tanglao said. 

Owoimaha-Church said while 

the COVID-19 pandemic posed 
challenges, it also provided an 
opportunity for the pair to meet 
virtually and collaborate on a 
podcast about identity in ways 
they may not have been able to 
previously.

The 
2021 
Central 
Student 

Government presidential and vice 
presidential debates, hosted by 
The Michigan Daily, discussed the 
candidates’ positions on campus 
policing; diversity, equity and 
inclusion; carbon neutrality and 
amplifying all student voices. 
Included in the March 18 debate 
were both the presidential and 
vice presidential candidates from 
all three CSG executive tickets: 
ORGANIZE, 
CHANGE 
and 

IMPACT. Each round lasted 45 
minutes with the opportunity for 
candidates to present opening and 
closing statements. 

The 
debate 
began 
with 

a 
question 
regarding 
each 

campaign’s anti-policing demands 
as they relate to anti-racism and 
DEI initiatives.

CHANGE 
presidential 

candidate Abner Santiago, LSA 
junior, said he and his team 
want to rework the Division of 
Public Safety and Security, but 
does not specifically know how. 
Both 
ORGANIZE 
presidential 

candidate Sujin Kim, LSA junior, 
and 
IMPACT 
presidential 

candidate Nithya Arun, Public 
Health junior, cited specific plans 
to disarm DPSS.

ORGANIZE 
is 
endorsed 

by 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, 
who 
advocated 

for change in the structure of 
DPSS and for diversion of funds 
from DPSS during their fall 
strike when it comes to campus 
policing. Kim echoed their calls 
for demilitarization. 

“We know (demilitarization) 

was a specific demand that (GEO) 
had that wasn’t met and we are 
extremely regretful about that on 
their behalf,” Kim said. “We stand 
with them and we support their 
demands and we are committed 
to working with them on getting 
this specific topic, and their other 
demands met in the coming year.”

Arun also noted that IMPACT 

hopes to work with GEO, as well 
as the Office for Health Equity and 
Inclusion, to achieve their goal of 
demilitarization.

“As a public health scholar, 

we are taught that data drives 
good policy,” Arun said. “I’m a 
research associate with the Office 
for Health, Equity and Inclusion, 
and there’s an ongoing study 
that 
discusses 
adverse 
police 

effects on students, and we will 
be utilizing their help to convince 
administrators to drive policy to 
disarm AAPD (Ann Arbor Police 
Department) and DPSS.”

When discussing how to best 

support international students, 
all three candidates agreed they 
would work to cut the $500 
international 
student 
fee, 
as 

they believe it is a barrier to the 
University. 

Kim said she would work to 

create an International Student 
Policy Coordinator position on 
CSG, while Arun said she would 
appoint a Chair of International 

Student Affairs to the executive 
branch.

Each candidate had different 

ideas 
about 
how 
to 
support 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
efforts at the University and 
within student organizations.

Arun laid out multiple initiatives 

that IMPACT would take to ensure 
all students feel supported and 
welcome on campus.

“First, we will be pushing 

for the extension of Wolverine 
Pathways, alongside other groups 
on campus,” Arun said. “Secondly, 
we want to organize an annual 
research symposium led by people 
of color and LGBTQ+ scholars.”

Kim said she finds it most 

important to work to increase 
the diversity of faculty and staff, 
in addition to the work her team 
would do to serve as advocates for 
students.

“We would create a standing 

weekly meeting for representatives 
from racial and ethnic justice 
organizations with our chief of 
staff,” Kim said. “The purpose of 
this meeting would be for students 
to have a direct pipeline, direct 
access to advocacy resources and 
to CSG resources as a whole.”

Santiago said CHANGE’s plan 

is to partner with already existing 
organizations, such as La Casa 
and multicultural fraternities and 
sororities, that he said promote 
DEI throughout campus.

“I 
believe 
reworking 
DEI 

efforts throughout the schools (is 
important) to ensure that students 
actually know what DEI efforts 
are and what they mean,” Santiago 
said. “We also want to partner with 
current 
existing 
organizations 

that already know how to best 
tackle these problems.”

The Daily also asked about the 

University’s 
recently 
released 

carbon neutrality plan which aims 
for the University to achieve net 
zero carbon emissions by the year 
2040.

Santiago 
said 
he 
believes 

the 
University 
needs 
to 
be 

more 
transparent 
with 
their 

investments moving forward. Kim 
stated she believes the University’s 
goals should be accelerated to 
achieve net-zero carbon emissions 
by 2030. Arun cited the work she’s 
done with the Climate Action 
Movement, a campus activist 
group that pushed the University to 
enact environmentally sustainable 
policies, to call for the University’s 
complete divestment of fossil fuels 
and to call out the University’s 
reliance on carbon offsets.

“As 
the 
Climate 
Action 

Movement cited in The Michigan 
Daily article that was published, 
we really want to find a way to 
catalyze the process to ensure that 
we’re not wholly relying on carbon 
offsets, because at the end of the 
day, carbon offsets are known 
as a cheat to hold institutions 
less accountable for the carbon 
emissions they emit,” Arun said.

The candidates were also asked 

how they would improve mental 
health 
services 
and 
wellness 

on campus, to which they all 
stated that short-term solutions 

such as the “well-being breaks” 
implemented this semester are 
not enough. They all also said 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services, which has long been 
criticized heavily for its long wait 
times, should be more accessible 
for students.

The candidates each got a 

chance to discuss how they 
would amplify student voices on 
the Board of Regents. All three 
candidates stated they will lobby 
for a student position on the Board 
of Regents.

Finally, each candidate spoke 

about sexual misconduct at the 
University and supporting student 
survivors. Santiago and Kim placed 
emphasis on screening all faculty 
and staff to determine if they have 
a history of sexual misconduct in 
response to multiple allegations 
against staff in recent years. Arun 
prioritized establishing a sexual 
misconduct task force. According 
to IMPACT’s platform, the task 
force would gather data and 
evaluate existing policies. 

After 
a 
ten-minute 
break, 

the 
vice 
presidential 
debate 

began with a question about 
how CSG would work to rebuild 
trust between students and the 
University’s administration after 
the 
tumultuous 
fall 
semester 

while still holding leadership 
accountable. 

IMPACT 
vice 
presidential 

candidate Carla Voigt, Engineering 
junior; CHANGE vice presidential 
candidate Nicole Lin, LSA junior; 
and ORGANIZE vice presidential 
candidate Sam Burnstein, LSA 
junior, all voiced their support for 
the GEO strike.

“We hope to support GEO in 

their efforts, which is shown 
throughout our policies,” Voigt 
said. “We want to stand with grad 
students in supporting them with 
a fund for childcare, as well as a 
persons of color symposium.”

As a resident adviser who 

participated in the R.A. strike that 
took place during the GEO strike in 
the fall, Lin said she looks forward 
to working with GEO if elected. 

“I think the student body can 

really trust Abner and I because we 
are just like normal students, we 
have connections with individuals 
outside of CSG, so I think we’re 
more relatable,” Lin said.

Burnstein explained his ideas 

for making sure CSG advocates 
for students and works with the 
University to truly improve what 
needs to be reworked.

“Our vision for CSG is to 

reimagine it as a source of 
collective bargaining, on behalf 
of all students, in which we can 
use the leverage and institutional 

power of CSG to lobby ... the 
administration 
and 
advanced 

the demands put forward by by 
GEO, CAM and a number of other 
advocacy groups on campus,” 
Burnstein said.

The 
vice-presidential 

candidates also shared whether 
or not they agree with the 
University’s plan to bring students 
back to campus for the Fall 2021 
semester.

All three candidates agreed 

the fall semester’s success would 
be contingent on how well the 
University follows public health 
guidelines 
and 
makes 
sure 

students remain cautious.

Each 
candidate 
also 
said 

they would work to make sure 
University services are accessible 
to all students, especially those 
with 
disabilities. 
Burnstein 

spoke on the accessibility of 
the 
University’s 
technological 

services.

“One of the big privileges 

afforded to the president and vice 
president of Student Government 
is being able to meet regularly 
with the (University) president 
and meet regularly with the Board 
of Regents,” Burnstein said. “And 
I assure you that, if we’re elected, 
pushing for more modern, easy to 
use, technological systems such as 
Wolverine Access and Canvas will 
be at the top of our list.”

Voigt spoke about the specific 

plans IMPACT has to aid students 
with disabilities.

“First and foremost we want to 

start within CSG, we are planning 
to create a chair of disability 
accommodations on the executive 
branch, and also a disability task 
force to look into ways that we can 
support our disabled students on 
campus,” Voigt said.

Lin said she and Santiago want 

to make sure all students are aware 
of how the University supports 
students with disabilities.

“Abner and I hope to increase 

awareness and make (discussing 
resources 
for 
students 
with 

disabilities) part of freshman 
orientation,” Lin said. “We will also 
invite student organizations that 
support students with disabilities 
(to speak with students).” 

Finally, The Daily asked how 

each campaign would work to be 
more transparent with students, 
as approximately $10 of every 
student’s tuition goes into the CSG 
budget. All three candidates said 
that they want funding to go to the 
organizations that need it most.

I visited the Garfield Park conservatory in Chicago March 16, to fill the monotone void that midwestern winters create every year, and it made waiting for spring a little less dreadful.

Editor’s Note

The last print edition of The Michigan Daily, printed on March 17, 
2021, contained two incorrect bylines from Michigan in Color and 

Arts. The Daily apologizes to the authors of these two articles. 

• Page 5’s “Moon Cafe and kindness during Covid-19” should be 
attributed to Jessica Kwon, Senior MiC Editor. 
• Page 10’s “Divine cows, salt water and a little night farmer: Cafe 
Shapiro’s opening night” should be attributed to Matthew Eggers, 
Daily Arts Writer. 


On March 16, 2020, Kat Dyke, 

a waitress at the Earle Restaurant 
in Ann Arbor, was told she would 
not be allowed to return to work 
for the time being — not because of 
her or anyone else’s wrongdoing, 
but because of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Dyke said she was thrown into 

a swirl of confusion when she 
received her boss’s text saying the 
Earle would be shut down for the 
near future. Her boss was required 
to close the restaurant due to 
a COVID-19 emergency order 
issued by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 
which shut down restaurants 
and entertainment venues across 
Michigan temporarily. She said 
she worried about the future of 
her and her friends’ jobs in the 
service industry. 

“I was really nervous,” Dyke 

said. “Just in general. My boss 
texted everybody and was like, 
‘Hey, you know, we’re done, we’ll 
let you know when we need you.’ 
It was scary.”

Though Dyke said she was 

able to return to work after about 
three days to assist with takeout 
deliveries, 
which 
were 
still 

allowed under Whitmer’s order, 
the lack of work for some service 
workers lasted for weeks to 
months. In fact, in April 2020, the 
leisure and hospitality industry 
unemployment rate skyrocketed 
to 39.3%, but has reduced to 6.2% 
as of March 2021.

Dyke 
said 
her 
colleagues 

and friends within the service 
industry who’ve faced layoffs 
have struggled to keep up with 
the economic strain resulting 
from the pandemic. 

“I talked to a couple of different 

people that I worked with and 

they’re like, ‘I either have to buy 
food or pay my bills,’” Dyke said. 
“(For the) people close to me, it 
was really rough.”

In addition to high levels of 

unemployment 
among 
service 

workers 
during 
the 
COVID-

19 pandemic, those who have 
continued to work in-person 
faced new struggles maintaining 
their own safety while serving 
customers. 

Another 
service 
industry 

worker and a student at the 
University of Michigan spoke to 
The Daily about their work in 
the service industry. They asked 
to remain anonymous for fear 
of retaliation at their place of 
employment and will be referred 
to as Sam throughout the article. 

Sam discussed struggles to 

serve customers who specifically 
don’t want to abide by the 
statewide mask mandate and 
said it is hard to manage different 
priorities like her own safety 
versus customer service. 

“I 
remember 
one 
specific 

instance where (a customer) didn’t 
want to wear masks and they were 
very upset that we asked them to,” 
Sam said. “And they were really, 
really rude. We were treating 
them the same way as we would 
treat any other guests. And we 
were just doing our best.” 

Sam also spoke about the 

difficulties restaurant and bar staff 
have in trying to simultaneously 
remain 
efficient 
and 
follow 

increased protocols. They said the 
restaurant they work at has not 
properly kept up with COVID-19 
cleanliness requirements, such as 
incorrectly sanitizing tables or not 
changing gloves after one use, and 
speculated that other businesses 
were likely similar. 

“There’s this expectation of 

just being ‘back to normal,’ or this 

desire to have that,” Sam said. 
“And I think that it not only sets 
up an unrealistic expectation of 
what this worker’s going to be able 
to do for you, but it also creates an 
incentive for people to cut corners. 
You do have to take little shortcuts 
just to be efficient. There (are) 
competing 
incentives 
between 

how you want service to go and 
how you work and maintaining 
COVID-19 safety (protocols).” 

Many service industry workers 

have turned to Service Industry 
Workers of the Ann Arbor Area for 
help with their situations. SIWA3 
is 
an 
organization 
dedicated 

to 
mutual 
aid, 
workplace 

organization and service worker 
advocacy and has helped ensure 
service workers in Ann Arbor can 
stay afloat and are being treated 
fairly by employers. Recently, 
SIWA3 raised more than $10,000 
from the Ann Arbor community 
through a GoFundMe campaign 
during the holiday season, funding 
that helped over one hundred 
service workers in Washtenaw 
County. 

Gabrielle Bussell, an organizer 

for SIWA3, spoke to The Daily 
about the organization’s mission 
of helping workers who have 
faced various difficulties within 
the industry as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Bussell specifically said the 

organization 
has 
looked 
to 

help workers facing wage-theft 
PPE 
shortages 
or 
workplace 

discrimination. She said she also 
thinks the state should put service 
workers higher on the priority list 
to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Currently, they are included as 
essential workers in phase 1C 
who are eligible earlier than the 
general population, but later than 
healthcare or education staff. 

“We’re hoping we can get sort 

of a stronger response from the 
organizations that are responsible 
for dealing with these workplace 
complaints and everything that’s 
been going on,” Bussell said. 
“That’s what we’re all about.” 

Dyke commended SIWA3 for 

bringing service industry workers 
together throughout this difficult 
time and the support they have 
given her and other service 
workers 
across 
Washtenaw 

County. 

“Industry workers need that 

level of solidarity that I feel like 
we’re getting with SIWA3,” Dyke 
said. “They’re definitely bringing 
industry workers together to look 
out for each other. It was already 
a difficult industry to begin with, 
and people now understand a 
little bit more the effects that 
our industry has on the greater 
world.”

Dyke also said she thinks the 

COVID-19 
pandemic 
exposed 

the importance of the service 
industry 
that 
will 
hopefully 

translate into better treatment 
for workers beyond the pandemic, 
especially as it pertains to their 
health being considered when 
decisions are made. 

“This service industry has such 

a huge effect on people; they want 
to go out, they want to have a nice 
time, but the people who are being 
a part of your experience need to 
be up to standard and need to feel 
comfortable giving you their best 
self,” Dyke said. “And they can’t 
do that if they can’t come to work 
(and) not (get) sick or if they can’t 
go to the doctor when they’re sick. 
So COVID definitely changed that 
perspective, and it was just very 
nice to see.”

Service industry workers in Ann Arbor 
face unemployment, economic constraints 

CITY

Repeated closures leave employees struggling to make ends meet

Fitzgerald said these individual 

meetings led to the creation of a 
staff handbook, a redesign of staff 
meetings and the implementation 
of drop-in hours with program 
directors, among other changes.

Chidimma Ozor Commer, a 

former ADVANCE employee from 
Nov. 2017 to August 2019 and a 
licensed social worker, confirmed 
that ADVANCE employees were 
given the opportunity to meet with 
an “outside consultant” in 2019 
but said this person was a friend of 
the program’s leadership, making 
the meetings a potential conflict 
of interest. Ozor Commer also 
confirmed that there was a new 
staff handbook, new opportunities 
for professional development and a 
redesign of staff meetings — she said 
she did not recall drop-in hours with 
program directors. 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email 

to The Daily on March 15 that 
because 
ADVANCE 
works 
to 

address faculty climate issues, “it is 
expected that the ADVANCE team 
would have knowledge of and have 
a professional relationship with 
experts in this field, both internal 
and external to the university.” 
Fitzgerald said ADVANCE hired 
Vineyard Associates, a “university-
approved vendor,” to meet with 
employees about internal climate 
concerns. 

Smith also said a number of his 

former colleagues — particularly 
women of color — often told him 
that their writing was criticized for 
not being eloquent or effective even 
when the language was similar to 
past ADVANCE work. Smith said 
he received fewer comments on 
work that was identical to that of his 
BIPOC and women colleagues. Two 
other former ADVANCE employees 
contacted by The Daily corroborated 
this claim.

“(My colleagues) were made to 

feel, in very weird ways, like they 
were not articulate, like they were 
not skilled in terms of their writing 
and their expression, which is 
actually connected to some negative 
stereotypes 
around 
African-

Americans in our country,” Smith 
said. 

“And he said, ‘Who’s going to 

listen to you?’”

All former and current employees 

who spoke to The Daily said climate 
issues 
coincided 
with 
a 
high 

turnover rate for ADVANCE staff. 

One former ADVANCE employee, 

who requested anonymity due to 
fear of professional retaliation, 
said they were struck by the irony 
of working in a unit dedicated to 
ensuring a positive faculty climate 
while they faced internal issues 
of retention. This source will be 
referred to as Taylor.

“For a unit focused on faculty 

recruitment and retention, there 
was little done to create and 
maintain a positive work climate 
within ADVANCE,” Taylor wrote 
in an email to The Daily. “Our 
retention issues were probably 
worse off, number wise, than 
faculty’s. Our staff demographics, 
such as the number of staff of color, 
their status, and their length of stay 
at ADVANCE, were not impressive 
either.” 

According to interviews and 

anecdotal data provided by former 
employees, 30% of the ADVANCE 
team (three employees) quit in 2018 
and 40% (four employees) quit 
in 2019. The Daily learned of one 
ADVANCE employee that was fired 
in 2020. 

When asked to confirm these 

numbers and comment on the 
rate of employee departure from 
ADVANCE, Fitzgerald did not 
specifically confirm these numbers 
but wrote that the turnover rate is 
unsurprising given the small size of 
the organization.

“ADVANCE 
is 
a 
relatively 

small unit that typically has 12-15 
employees,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 

“With a unit this small, staff growth 
opportunities are limited and it’s not 
unusual for staff in small campus 
units to move to other campus 
positions.”

In the months after the survey 

results were released, numerous 
ADVANCE employees said they 
took steps to make sure employees 
were aware of the issues facing 
BIPOC in the office. 

These 
included 
hosting 
a 

screening of the documentary “The 
True Cost” and facilitating “lunch 
and learn” sessions for employees 
to 
discuss 
white 
supremacy 

in 
academic 
organizations, 

according to reports written by 
former 
ADVANCE 
employees 

and submitted to the University’s 
Human Resources office. These 
reports were obtained by The Daily.

Ozor Commer began the “lunch 

and learn” sessions in January 2019 
to raise awareness about issues 
facing BIPOC in the workplace 
and to foster a sense of community 
among staff. In an email to The 

Daily, Ozor Commer said these 
sessions gave ADVANCE employees 
a chance to do crucial DEI work 
within their own organization.

“The most rewarding aspect of my 

work was starting Lunch & Learns 
— informal educational sessions 
during lunch — in January 2019 
which became an opportunity to 
actually engage in DEI work, unpaid 
of course, and was instrumental in 
improving the culture and making 
it more inclusive and collegial,” Ozor 
Commer wrote. 

Ozor Commer said she was 

prompted to begin these sessions 
after experiencing a workplace 
culture she described as “racist, 
white supremacist, toxic, and hostile 
for BIPOC.” 

In June 2019, Ozor Commer 

underwent her annual performance 
review, which Linderman and 
Malley oversaw. According to Ozor 
Commer, the directors told her she 
was not in her office when people 
came looking for her and was not 
a strong writer — claims that Ozor 
Commer said were not valid.

“One day I asked Jan(et Malley) 

what (she) would have wanted that 
I did not produce, in terms of my 
writing, and her response: clarity,” 
Ozor Commer wrote. “That is not 
constructive nor useful feedback. 
What would one do with that?” 

Ozor Commer said she pushed 

back against the claim that she was 
never at work, noting that she was 
almost always in the office, but 
struggled with migraines and often 
kept the lights off. She also alleged 
that when she would approach 
Malley for clarification or feedback, 
she was directed to other research & 
evaluation team members. 

“There were lies about my 

performance which relates directly 
to white supremacy culture at 
ADVANCE,” Ozor Commer wrote. 
“Mistakes are not seen as learning 
opportunities, questions are not 
answered.”

These claims of discrimination 

have 
been 
echoed 
to 
The 

Daily by two employees on the 
administrative 
team. 
One 
of 

them, Benita Threadgill, former 
senior administrative assistant at 
ADVANCE, received criticism about 
her performance in the months 
before her position was terminated 
on June 19, 2017, according to a copy 
of the settlement agreement issued 
by ADVANCE, given to Threadgill 
and obtained by The Daily.

Threadgill had just returned 

from a two-month medical leave 
due to foot surgery when she 
was placed on a Performance 

Improvement Plan on April 17, 2017. 
The PIP gave Threadgill 60 days 
to meet the performance goals or 
risk termination from her position, 
according to a copy obtained by The 
Daily.

Threadgill said issuing the PIP on 

the date of her return made it clear to 
her that ADVANCE leadership did 
not intend to support her recovery, 
which had kept her out of the office 
since February 2017.

“The PIP? That’s legendary 

across the University,” Threadgill 
said. “That’s how they try to dress 
it up. They document, document, 
document, document. And when 
they want you gone, then you’re 
gone ... (Linderman) used it as a 
threat.” 

The PIP advised Threadgill 

to meet with the directors once a 
week to discuss her performance. 
According to a report submitted 
to University HR Representative 
Linda Dabrowski in June 2017 after 
six weeks of meetings, Threadgill 
wrote she felt she had reached a 
“stalemate” with Linderman and 
Hudgins, her supervisor.

When contacted by The Daily 

for a comment on her involvement 
in Threadgill’s case, Dabrowski 
directed the request to Fitzgerald. 

In 
the 
report, 
Threadgill 

reiterated 
her 
commitment 
to 

ADVANCE and disputed the belief 
that she was consistently late to 
work by offering several examples of 
her working overtime or coming to 
work early.

Threadgill said she was criticized 

for not completing tasks made 
difficult or impossible by her foot 
surgery, like greeting clients at the 
door or walking across the office.

“If that’s what you wanted me 

to do, was to come back, and I did, 
you should’ve had somebody else 
do those things,” Threadgill said. 
“You had student helpers, you had 
other people that were in there that 
could’ve done that. They didn’t want 
it to work.” 

Rebekah 
Ashley, 
associate 

director 
of 
academic 
human 

resources, declined to comment 
on her involvement in Threadgill’s 
case due to privacy concerns. 
Fitzgerald confirmed in an email 
that Threadgill was an employee at 
the University from 2009 to 2017 but 
said there is no evidence her surgery 
impacted her position at ADVANCE 
being terminated.

“We 
have 
consulted 
the 

ADVANCE 
staff, 
University 

Human Resources and others and 
I am absolutely confident in saying, 
categorically, that no staff member 

of the ADVANCE program has 
ever been terminated because of a 
disability,” Fitzgerald wrote.

Threadgill filed a charge with 

the 
U.S. 
Equal 
Employment 

Opportunity 
Commission 

in 
January 
2018, 
claiming 

ADVANCE retaliated against her 
for her disability and violated the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. 
The investigation, which found that 
Threadgill did not have a disability 
as classified under the ADA and 
would have been placed on a PIP 
regardless of whether she asked for 
accommodations, concluded in May 
2018. 

Michael N. Hanna, Threadgill’s 

attorney at the time, continued to 
pursue the case and coordinated 
a settlement agreement with the 
University that said Threadgill 
would be unable to “demean nor 
disparage the University of any of 
its current or former employees or 
agents to any third party.” The non-
disparagement agreement, which 
originally offered $4,000, was 
raised to $6,000 and submitted to 
Threadgill on Sept. 6, 2018.

“They tried to ... give a concession: 

‘Well, we’ll give you $4,000,’” 
Threadgill said. “I said ‘$4,000? For 
what?’ (They said) ‘You know, for it 
to all go away. Put a little something 
in your pocket.’ I said, ‘For that I 
will write a book, I will go to every 
news story, I will post it to Facebook 
myself.’ And (Hanna) laughed and 
he said, ‘Who’s going to listen to 
you?’”

Hanna did not respond to 

multiple requests for comment. 

In December 2019, The Daily 

reported that the University spent 
over $1.26 million on confidential 
settlement agreements from Nov. 
2018 to April 2019. These types of 
agreements, which prohibit former 
University employees from speaking 
negatively 
about 
their 
work 

experience, have received criticism 
as veiled attempts to silence former 
employees. 

Threadgill 
said 
leaving 
the 

University to work for a pastor 
at New Hope Baptist Church in 
Wayne, Mich. drastically reduced 
her income, which she said made 
her attorney and the University 
believe she would more easily 
accept the settlement offer. Even 
so, Threadgill ultimately decided to 
decline the offer and never signed 
the agreement. 

“I might be hungry, I might be 

losing everything, but I have my 
integrity and I have my character,” 
Threadgill said. “And I’m not going 
to be bought for that.”

“Without 
an 
organization 

that’s willing to listen ... I don’t see 
a lot of hope for change”

Former employees said they were 

not sure how ADVANCE should 
address these equity issues, many 
of which employees said are so 
ingrained and commonplace that 
they feel unchallengeable. Some 
acknowledged that while the data 
collection and analysis ADVANCE 
does is crucial to diversifying 
departments and supporting BIPOC 
faculty, the department needed to 
change internally before it could 
ethically carry out its mission.

Alex said ADVANCE leadership 

needed to learn how to talk about 
race and racism in ways that 
promoted equality and included 
the voices of the BIPOC employees 
within the office. Without this kind 
of understanding, they said, nothing 
would change. 

“Their ability to really have 

meaningful conversations when it 
comes to racial equity was nowhere 
near where it needed to be,” Alex 
said. 

Another 
former 
ADVANCE 

employee, who requested to remain 
anonymous due to fear of professional 
retaliation, said they also did not see 
the culture at ADVANCE changing 
without a major institutional shift. 
The former employee will be referred 
to as Morgan.

“I didn’t have very much hope for 

ADVANCE changing, just because 
leadership seemed to be particularly 
defensive and were not really open to 
hearing or really understanding the 
challenges that their staff were facing 
in that environment,” Morgan said. 
“So without an organization that’s 
willing to listen, is open to change 
and (is) reflecting on (how) maybe 
they haven’t been great, I don’t see a 
lot of hope for change.” 

Threadgill said the treatment of 

ADVANCE employees, especially 
BIPOC employees, was ironic and 
offensive given the stated values of 
the organization. She echoed many 
other employees in arguing that 
ADVANCE had to address internal 
climate issues and racist practices if 
they wanted to effect real change on 
campus. 

“We’re expected to promote 

this work-life balance,” Threadgill 
said. “We’re expected to respect 
employees. But you didn’t do it for 
me, and you didn’t do it for anybody 
who works for ADVANCE.”

Polluter 
Gelman 
Sciences 

and 
interveners 
from 
Ann 

Arbor, Washtenaw County, Scio 
Township and the Huron River 
Watershed Council will appear 
before Judge Tim Connors from 
May 3 through May 5 to weigh 
in on potential changes to the 
cleanup plan for Ann Arbor’s 
decades-old dioxane plume. 

The Gelman plume is an 

accumulation 
of 
pollution, 

specifically 
the 
chemical 

1,4-dioxane, that has existed in 
Ann Arbor groundwater for nearly 
four decades. Negotiations for 
cleaning up the plume have been 
ongoing for over four years — the 
relevant lawsuit against Gelman 
Sciences for this upcoming May 
hearing was filed in 2016.

After hearing oral arguments 

from Gelman and the intervening 
parties Monday morning, Connors 
denied Gelman’s motion to cancel 
upcoming 
hearings 
centered 

around the potential new cleanup 
protocol. As a result, all parties 
will appear before Connors in 
early May to present their ideas 
on modifying the existing consent 
judgment presiding over cleanup 
efforts. A consent judgment is an 
agreement between two parties 
where the judge supervises to 
ensure that the agreement is 
enforced.

“We need to move forward,” 

Connors said. “We need to have 
some decision made, and it’s 
my responsibility to make that 
decision.” 

Michael Caldwell, Gelman’s 

attorney, argued Monday that 
holding the remedy hearings 

would 
violate 
Gelman’s 

right to due process because 
modifications to the current 
consent judgment should not be 
made without Gelman’s consent. 
Nathan Dupes, attorney for Ann 
Arbor, countered that Caldwell’s 
argument is “premature” given 
that Monday’s hearing is a 
scheduling order for all parties to 
present arguments.

Connors said he anticipates 

Gelman will appeal his decision 
to 
move 
forward 
with 
the 

hearing, but he thinks this case 
has gone on for too long. Though 
he is the third judge to preside 
over the case since it was first 
filed in 1988, Connors said he 
doesn’t think he will be the last 
judge either.

Currently, the city is following 

the 
third 
consent 
judgment, 

which includes a pump-and-treat 
cleanup plan that opponents have 
argued has not been enough to 
adequately clean out the dioxane. 
In August 2020, a fourth consent 
judgment was proposed. Changes 
to the third consent judgment 
included lowering the cleanup 
standard from 85 parts-per-
billion to 7.2 ppb, thereby reducing 
qualifications 
for 
cleanup; 

expansion of the Prohibition 
Zone boundary to account for 
the lower cleanup standard; and 
increased monitoring of dioxane 
spread using well installments. 

The fourth consent judgment 

was ultimately rejected by the Ann 
Arbor City Council in October 
2020, citing an insufficient plan 
to effectively clean the dioxane 
and hold Gelman accountable.

In light of the administration’s 

initiative 
announced 
last 
fall 

to assemble a task force to help 
diversify the names of campus 
spaces, 
an 
analysis 
by 
The 

Michigan Daily of 103 on-campus 
buildings at the University of 
Michigan found that only one — 
the Trotter Multicultural Center 
— is named after a person of color. 
Trotter is named after William 
Monroe Trotter, a newspaper 
editor and activist for Black civil 
rights. This leaves 99.3% of the 
buildings included in The Daily’s 
analysis named for or endowed in 
the names of white people — the 
large majority of whom were white 
men.

A vast majority — 78.2% — of 

these buildings are named after 
men. Only 9.9% of the buildings 
analyzed by The Daily are named 
after women, while 11.9% were 
named for couples. 

The Daily’s analysis found that 

28% of buildings were named 
for former administrators, while 
24% of the buildings were named 
for donors to the University. In 
addition, 25% of buildings were 
named for alumni and 10.6% after 
professors.

The University announced in 

the fall that a task force of faculty, 
staff, students and administrators 
would convene this winter to 
develop a more diverse pool 
of names for campus spaces, 
according 
to 
the 
University 

Record.

The goal is for more named 

campus spaces that reflect the 
breadth 
of 
backgrounds 
and 

perspectives of people who have 
vitally shaped U-M’s teaching, 
research and service missions,” 
the Record article states. 

In 2016, the University planned 

on naming a new building to 
house 
the 
William 
Trotter 

Multicultural Center after Regent 

(D) Mark Bernstein and his wife. 
Students pushed back against 
the University’s decision, citing it 
would erase the legacy of William 
Trotter, a prominent Black activist 
and co-founder of a 1905 civil 
rights 
organization. 
Bernstein 

withdrew his pledged $3 million 
donation to center after the 
naming controversy.

Some of the buildings are 

named after controversial figures. 
W.K. Kellogg, the namesake for 
the Kellogg Eye Center, was a 
known eugenicist who advocated 
for “racial purity.” Angell Hall is 
named after the third University 
president 
James 
Angell, 
who 

championed accessible education 
but also drafted the predecessor 
treaty to the Chinese Exclusion Act 
of 1862, which barred immigration 
of Chinese workers. The Taubman 
College of Architecture is named 
for billionaire Alfred Taubman, 
who was convicted on two counts 
of price-fixing in 2002. 

In 2018, the University’s Board 

of Regents voted to remove 
Clarence Cook Little’s name from 
the science building named for him 
after sustained student protest 
against the name — the building 
was renamed the North University 
Building. Little, president of the 
University from 1925 to 1929, was 
also the former president of the 
American Eugenics Society and 
believed in restricting immigration 
and in forced sterilization.

A 
review 
of 
University 

demographics 
data 
compared 

to the demographics of building 
namesakes 
revealed 
a 
wide 

gap between the diversity of 
the 
campus 
population 
and 

the demographics of people its 
buildings are named after. 

Tracking enrollee 
demographics

Records 
in 
the 
Bentley 

Historical Library contain limited 
enrollment data from the 19th and 
early 20th centuries. Most years do 

not contain any demographic data 
based on race/ethnicity or gender.

In an email to The Daily, Brian 

A. Williams, assistant director and 
archivist for University History, 
wrote that the University did 
not track data on students’ races 
until the late 1960s. Williams 
is currently leading a project to 
identify every Black student that 
attended the University from 
its founding to the Black Action 
Movement in 1970.

According to records in the 

Bentley Historical Library, Samuel 
Codes Watson, a medical student 
admitted to the University in 1853, 
is known as the first Black student 
to be admitted to any school or 
college within the University. 
Because the University was not 
required to track students’ races 
until the 1960s, it is possible there 
was another Black student who 
attended before him. 

In 
1870, 
Madelon 
Louisa 

Stockwell became the first woman 
to be admitted — Stockwell Hall is 
named after her. Mary Henrietta 
Graham, the first Black woman 
to attend the University, was 
admitted in 1876.

Gender breakdown of enrollees

In 1922-1923, the first year on 

file where gender data of enrolled 
students at the University is 
recorded, women made up 33.8% 
of total enrollment. In 1930, 37.0% 
of the University’s total enrollment 
was female. 

From 1942-1945, women made 

up 52.4% of total enrollment — the 
steep rise likely came as a result 
of the Second World War. In 1955, 
this number dropped to 32.3%. 
From 1966-1967, the most recent 
year of historical data available 
until 2009, female students were 
36.7% of the University’s total 
enrollment.

The Michigan Almanac, which 

provides enrollment demographics 
from 2009 to the present, shows 
a near 50-50 male to female 

ratio in the University’s current 
undergraduate enrollment.

The report shows there was 

a less even gender split among 
graduate and professional students 
from 2009 to 2015, with males 
making up 10% more enrolled 
students. This ratio has evened out 
in past years and was equally split 
among men and women in 2019.

White 
undergraduate 

enrollment decreased from 65% 
to 55% from 2010 to 2019, while 
Asian American undergraduate 
enrollment 
increased 
by 
5 

percentage points to 15% over the 
past decade. 

Black 
undergraduate 

enrollment remained at 3-5% over 
the decade. These numbers sharply 
decreased after Michigan voters 
passed Proposal 2 in 2006, which 
effectively 
banned 
affirmative 

action in the admissions process. 
In the year before Proposal 2 was 
passed, Black students made up 
13% of total student enrollment. In 
2019, Latinx students made up 7% 
of the student body, with Native 
American and Hawiian students 
both making up 0%.

Racial and ethnic distribution 

of 
graduate 
students 
at 
the 

University from 2010 to 2019 saw a 
decrease in white enrollment from 
52% to 45%, and slight increases 

in Latinx and Black enrollment. 
Black enrollment remained around 
3%, consistent with undergraduate 
numbers.

In a recent interview with 

The Michigan Daily, University 
President Mark Schlissel said 
the University must elevate its 
commitment to Black students in 
the months and years to come. 

“We’ve worked hard and we’ve 

only been modestly successful 
increasing the representation, 
not just of African Americans, but 
of many other underrepresented 
groups on campus,” Schlissel 
said. 

While 
the 
University 

instituted the Summer Bridge 
Scholars 
program 
and 
the 

Community 
Scholar 
Program 

decades ago to help incoming 
Black 
students 
adjust 
to 

campus life at the University 
of Michigan, the program has 
become significantly more white 
in recent years. The Go Blue 
Guarantee, which offers full 
tuition to Michigan residents 
whose families make less than 
$65,000 per year, has increased 
the number of lower-income 
students at the University but 
increased 
Black 
enrollment 

has 
not 
followed 
since 
its 

establishment in 2018. 

U-M community discusses 

racial and gender disparities 

in the naming of campus 

buildings

LSA senior Thomas Vance, 

president of the Black Student 
Union, said he was not surprised 
to hear that these disparities 
in 
the 
diversity 
of 
building 

namesakes exist because of the 
lack of racial diversity among the 
student body.

Vance said there needs to be 

greater consideration of how 
the people that the University 
names buildings after impacted 
the 
University. 
For 
Vance, 

automatically naming buildings 
after former presidents is a 
misguided approach.

“We can’t just keep naming s--- 

after old white guys because of 
their status,” Vance said. “I think 
we should give the students who 
were there at that time a little bit of 
say. Whether they fill out a form to 
talk about their experiences at the 
University under that president, 
whether it’s direct interactions 
with whoever they want to name 
the building after.”

According to the report, offsets 

and carbon sinks would be used as a 
tool to achieve carbon neutrality by 
2025. While the University would 
not be emitting zero carbon by 2025, 
they would be sequestering as much 
carbon as they are outputting at 
that point, according to the report. 
The PCCN recommended that the 
University prioritize achieving net-
zero Scope 1 emissions without 
offsets by 2040.

According to the report, the use of 

offsets to achieve net zero emissions 
would significantly reduce the social 
cost of University emissions. The 
commission notes that, assuming 
the social cost of carbon emissions 
is $50 per metric ton of carbon 
dioxide equivalent, offsets from the 
University would save $325 million 
in avoided climate change damages. 

“An 
important 
assumption 

underlying this recommendation is 
that the use of offsets to help meet 
this goal is financially responsible,” 
the report reads. “Expected carbon 
offsetting costs for U-M to achieve 
a Scope 1 carbon neutrality goal 
are relatively low compared to 
carbon reduction capital costs and 
the expected benefits from climate 
mitigation.”

The report specifies that a 

majority of commissioners are in 
favor of using carbon offsets. The 
minority of commissioners who 
oppose carbon offsetting believe the 
administration should prioritize the 
reduction of direct emissions and 
accelerate progress towards actually 
eliminating emissions on campus 
rather than dedicating financial 
resources to offsets.

The Climate Action Movement 

released a statement in response to 
the final report, pointing at plans 
for stustainable housing, discussions 
of 
accountability 
mechanisms, 

and 
attention 
to 
envornmental 

justice as improvements from the 
preliminary report. However, CAM 
also highlighted “critical flaws” in 
the report, including the reliance on 
carbon offsets and a lack of specificity 
on energy procurement. The 2040 
carbon neutrality date is “far-too-
late,” according to the statement. 

“Thus, while the report takes 

some steps in the right direction, it 
falls far short of what the science 
tells us is necessary: a radical, swift 
transition to a resilient, carbon free 
economy, centering the basic needs of 
our most marginalized community 
members,” the statement said. “The 
University of Michigan needs a 
climate justice plan, not just a carbon 
neutrality plan.”

Plans to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 

emissions 

The 
report 
outlines 
several 

specific strategies for the University 
to implement to achieve Scope 1 
and Scope 2 neutrality with carbon 
offsets by 2025. Many of the draft 
recommendations 
carried 
over 

into the final report, including 
an estimated $3.37 billion plan to 
transform the University’s heating 
and cooling infrastructure. 

The plan would replace the 

existing 
systems 
on 
all 
three 

campuses with a geo-exchange 
system that would provide heat by 
using the natural temperature in 
the ground. If implemented, this 
project would be one of the most 
costly strategies and would be the 
largest of its kind at any university, 
significantly cutting campus-related 
Scope 1 emissions.

Regarding Scope 2 emissions, 

the 
commission 
recommends 

the 
administration 
decarbonize 

the University’s electrical grid by 
shifting from fossil fuel energy to 
renewable energy and purchasing 
Renewable 
Energy 
Certificates. 

These certificates would amount to 
investments in renewable energy 
that 
are 
generated 
off-campus, 

essentially allowing the University 
to offset the entirety of its electricity 
through renewables.

Beyond 
energy, 
the 
PCCN 

recommends that the University 
move 
toward 
completely 

decarbonizing their transit fleet, 
which 
includes 
buses, 
vans, 

trucks and cars. The report also 
recommends that the University 
establish new building standards 
with more progressive emissions 
targets. 

Though the report proposes a 

timeline for Scope 3 emissions to 
be reduced to zero by 2040, targets 
for each category within Scope 3 
emissions should be established 

by 2025, according to the report. 
One such category is commuting 
emissions. The commission proposed 
increasing investment in electric 
vehicle charging stations, which 
would 
theoretically 
incentivize 

campus employees to use electric 
vehicles, thereby reducing emissions. 

Due to recent breakthroughs 

in video conferencing capabilities 
and 
their 
widespread 
adoption 

during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
commission recommended that the 
University de-emphasize traveling 
long distances for meetings that can 
be conducted remotely. The report 
also includes a recommendation 
to continue using the expanded 
virtual infrastructure and keep some 
employees working remotely.

Additionally, 
the 
commission 

recommended that the University 
should attempt to lower the impact 
of Scope 3 emissions by offering a 
more plant-forward approach to 
their MDining menus and reducing 
animal proteins, which are more 
carbon intensive.

The 
commission 
did 
not 

make any recommendations that 
addressed divestment from fossil 
fuel investments, a point frequently 
mentioned by climate activists at the 
University. When Schlissel initially 
created the commission, the issue of 
divestment was excluded from the 
scope of work. 

The Board of Regents announced 

a pause in pursuing investments in 
fossil fuel companies in February 
2020. At the February 2021 Regents 
meeting, Regent Mark Bernstein 
(D) said the Board of Regents would 
provide an update on making the 
University’s investment policy more 
sustainable in March. 

New administrative and 

academic positions and priorities

Since the draft report was 

released in Dec. 2020, student 
activists have expressed concern 
that the administration will not 
fully 
implement 
the 
proposed 

recommendations. In a previous 
interview with The Daily, Rackham 
student 
Matt 
Sehrsweeney, 
a 

member of the campus activist group 
Climate Action Movement, said the 
commission needed to ensure the 
administration pursued the report’s 
recommended 
carbon 
neutrality 

program.

“There needs to be some sort 

of mechanism of accountability 
to make sure that all of these 
recommendations are actually put 
into place, because if there isn’t, then 
these are meaningless,” Sehrsweeney 
said.

To 
hold 
the 
University 

accountable to implementing their 
recommendations, 
the 
PCCN 

asked the University to create 
an 
administrative 
“executive 

leadership” position. This position 
would be responsible for reviewing 
PCCN 
recommendations 
and 

prioritizing their implementation, 
advising the president on carbon 
neutrality, 
representing 
carbon 

neutrality interests in executive 
discussions 
and 
developing 

assessments of progress towards key 
carbon neutrality goals.

In 
an 
interview 
with 
The 

Daily, Forrest discussed how this 
position could help create a culture 
at the University that values the 
importance of climate action. 

“It was not so clear in our draft 

report that really leadership does 
everything,” Forrest said. “We’re 
not just talking about the leadership 
at the very top, but a web of leaders, 
all the way through the campus with 
all demographics of the campus 
at all levels, so that whoever is 
the president, or whoever are the 
Regents, or whoever are department 
chairs and students, that this culture 
is embedded deeply within the 
University, because this is a decades-
long project.”

The 
commission 
also 

recommended that a community 
advisory committee be set up to 
report on progress towards neutrality 
goals to the public and act as liaisons 
between them and the University. 

“A key purpose of a community 

advisory committee is to ensure 
that the perspectives of diverse 
stakeholders are well-represented 
and fully considered as U-M develops 
and implements its carbon neutrality 
plan,” the report reads. 

Representatives 
on 
this 

committee would include at least 
one graduate student and one 
undergraduate student, members 
from all three campuses, those from 
communities 
disproportionately 

affected by climate change and 
faculty and members of business or 

nonprofit organizations with direct 
ties to environmental justice and 
climate change. 

The PCCN also proposed ways 

to better educate students and hold 
them 
accountable 
for 
reaching 

carbon neutrality goals. The report 
suggests the University create a 
required orientation module to 
familiarize incoming students and 
community 
members 
with 
the 

University’s climate action goals and 
commitments to carbon neutrality, 
as they do for sexual misconduct and 
alcohol and drug use. 

The report also urges all academic 

units to create a course on how 
climate change can impact their 
area of study and provide a list of 
existing courses that relate to carbon 
neutrality efforts. 

Environmental justice and 

accountability

The 
final 
recommendations 

focus heavily on campus culture, 
organizational accountability and 
environmental 
justice. 
During 

the PCCN’s earlier stages, the 
Commission often faced criticism for 
perceived neglect of the latter. 

Now, a letter from the commission 

at the beginning of the report explains 
that evaluating the recommendations 
for reduced carbon emissions from 
an environmental justice perspective 
must be integral to the process.

“We affirm that the climate 

crisis poses the most harm to 
communities that are historically 
and unfairly disadvantaged and 
disenfranchised,” the report states. 
“Each 
of 
our 
recommendations 

brings with it a different set of 
environmental justice considerations. 
Accordingly, environmental justice 
must be comprehensively interwoven 
throughout U-M’s climate action plan, 
rather than being a supplementary 
step.”

The report defines environmental 

justice as “the fair treatment and 
meaningful involvement of all people 
regardless of race, color, national 
origin, or income with respect to the 
development, implementation and 
enforcement of environmental laws, 
regulations and policies.” 

The 
commission 
underscored 

the importance of engaging with 
environmental 
justice 
experts 

and 
communities 
which 
are 

disproportionately affected by the 
climate crisis. Each recommendation 
with an appendix has a section titled 
“Equity and Justice Considerations” 
to factor environmental justice into 
the proposed change to campus 
operations. Related to calls for more 
consideration 
of 
environmental 

justice are matters of accountability. 

“Achieving 
carbon 
neutrality 

will 
require 
coordinated 
action 

and accountability by all units and 
individuals throughout the university, 
and 
success 
requires 
that 
the 

structural and cultural architectures 
align with university goals and the 
associated work,” the report reads.

Carbon neutrality in the state of 

Michigan

In 2018, the Intergovernmental 

Panel on Climate Change published a 
report that concluded the damage of 
natural disasters could be mitigated 
if global warming were limited to 
no more than 1.5˚C. The IPCC said 
humans would have to decrease 
emissions to 45% below 2010 levels by 
2030 and ultimately achieve net zero 
emissions by 2050 in order to keep this 
warming below 1.5˚C.

Local and state governments have 

taken several actions in response to 
the climate crisis. The city of Ann 
Arbor launched the A2Zero plan 
in March 2020 to achieve carbon 
neutrality in the city by 2030. 
Last month, Mayor Christopher 
Taylor was also appointed to serve 
as a special adviser on the Global 
Executive Committee on Climate 
Action, an international body seeking 
to enhance sustainability within local 
governments.

In September 2020, Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer announced the state of 
Michigan would set the goal of going 
carbon neutral by 2050.

Haverkamp said the release of the 

recommendations does not mark 
the end of the University’s efforts to 
achieve net-zero emissions, but rather 
a beginning to that journey.

“It’s both the culmination of our 

commission’s work and the first step 
for the University’s implementation of 
carbon neutrality,” Haverkamp said.

French composer Claude Debussy 

undoubtedly remains at the forefront 
of impressionism in music. He may 
have denied it, shrugging off the 
movement as a mere label, but as of 
today, he’s the first to come up in a 
quick Googling of the musical genre. 
The next to come up in the search, 
other than “La Mer,” “Clair de Lune” 
and a few of his other staples, might be 
his Préludes. Capped at a few minutes 
apiece, these bite-sized works for 
piano are perfect for anyone new to 
his works. However, the Préludes are 
not solely for the unfamiliar, as they 
can be calming delicacies to frequent 
listeners of Debussy as well. To a 
performer especially, these pieces 
offer a range of emotional possibilities; 
each piece, like a character sketch in 

an artist’s sketchbook, has a distinct 
essence and spirit to explore. 

Last Sunday, saxophonist Andrew 

Rathbun and pianist Matthew Fries 
brought Impressions of Debussy 
(Rathbun’s latest album) and a 
jazz tribute to the Préludes to the 
Kerrytown Concert House stage. The 
venue welcomed Rathbun and Fries 
as part of their weekly live stream, 
“Live @ The 415.” The month of 
March marks one year since the series 
first aired, and since then, the venue 
has consistently been offering free 
virtual concerts to the public. The 
venue’s move to online streaming has 
played a role in keeping Ann Arbor’s 
music scene alive. From the music of 
cabaret to the sonatas of Beethoven, 
“Live @ The 415” continues to bring 
a wide selection of performers to Ann 
Arbor. 

The virtual concert opened with 

a recent composition by Fries, titled 

“Quarantine” — a nod to this past 
year. Despite its name, as Rathbun 
later pointed out to the audience, the 
piece carried a “slight air of optimism” 
with its lively rhythms and flourishes. 
Though written back in September, 
the composition was a perfect fit for 
last weekend, depicting a world more 
hopeful for the end of quarantine. 
With a brief cut in the live stream’s 
audio, the piece’s namesake was a 
gentle reminder that of course, it 
wouldn’t be quarantine without the 
technical difficulties. 

The program continued with 

works from Debussy’s Préludes for 
solo piano, reimagined by Rathbun 
in a jazzy saxophone and piano duet. 
Drawing from Debussy’s signature 
color palette, Rathbun interpreted 
the Prélude No. 10 “Canope” with 
a similar sentiment as the original, 
while emitting a much livelier feeling. 
Debussy’s “Canope” had hints of the 

delicate and the ethereal, whereas 
Rathbun’s 
interpretation 
seemed 

more grounded in its elements. 

Similarly, his reimagining of the 

Préludes’s “Girl with the Flaxen 
Hair” and “Footsteps in the Snow” 
brought an earthiness to the originals 
— a color of voice that is absent in 
Debussy’s instrumentation and only 
available through the introduction 
of a second voice by way of the 
saxophone. By arranging Debussy’s 
Préludes 
for 
two 
instruments 

rather than one, Rathbun has 
made an interpretation tinged with 
optimism. The pianist of Debussy’s 
préludes is no longer alone, and 
while Rathbun’s version may have 
lost the striking solitary quality of 
Debussy’s original, it also brought a 
sense of companionship to Debussy’s 
lonely tunes. As a newcomer to jazz, 
I entered the concert unsure of what 
a jazz-classical crossover would 

look like, especially in a virtual 
setting. However, through Fries and 
Rathbun’s performance, I was able to 
appreciate the liveliness that a hint of 
improvisation brings. 

Ending 
the 
program 
with 

“Half Nelson” by Miles Davis, the 
performers departed from Debussy 
and let loose into the upbeat rhythms 
of bebop. This tune was lighthearted 

and served as a swift final display of 
virtuosity from Fries and Rathbun. 
While distinct from the mellow 
qualities of the previous pieces, the 
finale was far from abrupt. Rather, 
it seemed that every part of their 
performance — from the original 
works of Fries to Rathbun’s Préludes 
to the ending bebop — was produced 
from the same lens.

Last week, “Michigan’s Got Talent: 

A Talent Show Celebrating Diversity, 
Equity, and Inclusion in the Arts!” 
premiered on YouTube. The pre-
recorded talent show was curated and 
presented by Music Matters, a non-
profit student organization that uses 
music to advocate for social causes 
— their most notable event being 
SpringFest, an annual philanthropic 
concert series.

The evening began with an 

introduction by host Adam Seltzer, 
University of Michigan class of 2020 
alum and former Music Matters DEI 
chairman. 

“As an organization that’s devoted 

to making a social impact in the 
community,” Seltzer began, “it’s extra 
important that we look internally, 
inside ourselves, and think: Do we 
embody the values we’re trying to put 
out in the world?”

“Michigan’s 
Got 
Talent” 

(MGT) was a program of at-home 
performances; undergraduate and 
graduate students broadcasted their 
talents from living room couches, 
bedroom desks, classrooms and 
several campus locations. 

Contestants performed covers 

of Frank Ocean and Nina Simone, 
Bandari 
and 
hip-hop 
dance 

routines, a seven-part a cappella 
arrangement of Jill Scott’s “He 
Loves Me” and even some original 
music: a nostalgic singer-songwriter 
piece, a satirical musical theater 
number and some forward-thinking 
rap. Between acts were brief cameos 
by Martino Harmon, vice president 
for student life, Claire Hao, The 
Michigan Daily’s Editor in Chief and 
Tiffany Porter, University alum and 
two-time track and field Olympian, 
all answering the question: What 
does DEI mean to you?

After a quick 35 minutes, the 

program came to a close, and viewers 
were directed to a Google Form for 
“Superlative Voting” to determine the 
most unique, creative, entertaining, 
impactful and most-likely-to-watch-
in-concert MGT acts. At the end of the 
evening, these artists and performers 
had undeniably been given a new 
platform to display their work and 
their passions. But was it a stage 
genuinely rooted in DEI values?

While it indeed initiated a much-

needed 
celebration 
of 
diverse, 

distinctive talent on the University’s 
campus, MGT fell flat in actually 
addressing the DEI work under which 
it was branded. Rather than energize 
productive, 
intentional 
dialogue 

surrounding the importance of DEI 
on the University’s campus, MGT 
hardly scratched the surface of the 
issue and, in doing so, felt notably 
performative.

The 
whole 
program 
felt 

unnecessarily rushed, such that 
when Seltzer announced, “Wow, that 
was such an awesome show,” in the 
past tense, I felt startled by an abrupt 
conclusion. The acts themselves 
were quite brief and presented in 
an oddly nonuniform way. Most 
acts were just over a minute long, 
although a select few were closer to 
three or four minutes. Some students 
took time to introduce themselves 
and their talent, others didn’t. Some 
gave written introductions, but their 
words were displayed quickly, giving 
us hardly enough time to read and 
get acquainted with the artist. Such 
inconsistent, hurried presentations 
of the acts were a shame, not only 
because the acts themselves were 
impressive and entertaining, but also 
because it felt at odds with Music 
Matters’s goal of equity. 

To the viewer, watching MGT felt 

like being whisked through a museum 
filled with gorgeous art, without time 
to appreciate each individual piece. 
Considering that it was a pre-edited 
event, this was probably avoidable.

Maybe the brevity of the program 

was purposeful, its fast pace intended 
to capture and hold the attention of an 
audience situated within the digital 
age. Yet, whether or not this was 
the case, the show felt like a cursory 
glance-over, when DEI itself is deep, 
long-term work. 

If MGT’s goal was to honor 

these artists and their talents, to 
create space for what they have 
to offer, why rush them? Instead, 
they might have given acts more 
generous performance windows, 
more time to explain who they are 
and why their music matters, and 
perhaps even why DEI is important 
to them. By not fully engaging with 
their acts, MGT risked putting 
their contestants up for display, like 
colleges 
frantically 
proclaiming 

their 
diversity 
initiatives 
with 

pictures of token minority students 
on admissions pamphlets.

MGT also lacked a crucial 

component: 
an 
intentional 

definition of its titular DEI principle. 
MGT asked, “What does DEI mean 
to you?” when most Americans 
haven’t yet asked, “What does DEI 
mean?” Without an answer to the 
latter, more fundamental question, 
any answer to the former is nearly 
meaningless. 

Harmon said, “Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion is truly achieved when 

it’s infused in everyday life, when it’s 
a part of who we are, when we don’t 
have to specifically call it out, because 
we know it, it’s how we live.” Although 
he speaks of a beautiful sentiment, the 
meaning of his statement evaporates 
to any audience member who isn’t 
really sure what “it” is.

In her cameo, Porter, an alum and 

Olympian, gave the closest thing to 
a definition of DEI. She made the 
distinction between inclusion, which 
means “to give people opportunities 
to have a seat at the table,” and equity, 
which aims “to allow people to have a 
level playing field.” 

If it weren’t for Porter, Music 

Matters would have left DEI fully 
nebulous and undefined. But even 
then, 
Porter’s 
partial 
definition 

came in the last ten minutes of the 
show, after viewers had already been 
“celebrating” undefined DEI for 25 
minutes. As a result, the audience 
received the message that “DEI 
is 
important!” 
without 
actually 

engaging with DEI itself. 

MGT’s 
hurried, 
surface-level 

execution 
was 
not 
enough 
to 

be 
considered 
conscientious, 

comprehensive DEI work. However, 
the 227 people who tuned in live to 
MGT may think it’s enough. They 
might be misled to believe that this 
version of activism is good enough, 

that this is a place to settle in their 
own individual DEI work, or even 
that, by tuning in, they’ve taken 
action. Music Matters had a real 
opportunity to lead by example, 
to show what it looks like to truly 
engage in DEI work. Instead, they 
perpetuated the harmful ambiguity 
surrounding DEI, which so often 
leads to sanctified inaction and a 
sense of satisfactory performative 
action.

However, 
Music 
Matters 
is 

vocal about its commitment to 
positive change. The group even 
recognizes the long-term nature of 
true DEI work and the importance 
of “collectively recognizing and 
embracing this challenge rather 
than avoiding it.” It is important 
that we invite Music Matters to 
pursue their DEI goals, but not 
without holding them accountable 
for surface-level performativity and 
challenging them to make sincere, 
deep-seated change.

So, let’s return to Seltzer’s initial 

question: Do we embody the values 
we put out into the world? In the 
case of “Michigan’s Got Talent,” the 
answer Music Matters is looking for 
is no. 

But can they? And will they in 

the future? Yes, they can, with our 
support.

Like most kids born at the start of 

the millennium, video games acted as 
my live-in nanny. I learned to read with 
a clunky old LeapPad tablet, which, if 
I still had today, would be caked in a 
sticky goo that always seems to exist 
on the grubby hands of toddlers. I 
honed my hand-eye coordination as I 
internalized crushing defeat by Matt, 
the overpowered CPU in “Wii Sports.” 
I spent hours in the school computer 
lab serving customers in the food-
service simulator “Papa’s Pizzeria.” 
My idle mind never went very far as 
long as I could beat my Rainbow Road 
record on “Mario Kart” or speedrun 
an island of “Poptropica.”

I can’t help but imagine how 

things would have been different 
if my brain’s development was 
supplemented with today’s video 
games, more specifically, the crowd-
pleasing cultural phenomenon that is 
“Fortnite.” Fortnite is a first-person 
shooter with a sparkly, cartoonish 
twist, but it is also a concert venue, 
a chat room, a battle-royale stadium 
and 
its 
very 
own 
multiverse. 

Somehow, under layers of whimsical 
depictions of violence, fantastical 
costumes and a detailed map is a 
nexus of pop culture. 

I’ve been trying to figure out how 

a game like Fortnite is able to have 
such a tight grasp on entertainment 
industry giants since its earliest 
collaboration 
deals 
were 
made. 

The idea that the same game that 
programmed a TikTok dance to The 
Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” into its 
character emotes has creative liberties 
with parts of the John Wick franchise 
is bizarre, if not borderline dystopian.

Maybe I am too cynical to 

recognize that not every game is 
designed to my taste — to me, Fortnite 
is a place for kids to scream at each 
other from across the world and force 
virtual Keanu Reeves to floss. Alas, 
as much as it hurts, it’s important to 
recognize Fortnite for what it is: a 
monumental asset to both the gaming 
industry and the world of pop culture. 

Fortnite is the accumulation of 

everything gaming has managed 
to improve upon in the last two 
decades. Cross-platform play, like 
that of “Minecraft’s” Xbox, Pocket 
Edition and PC versions, offers 
accessibility across players. Wireless 
communication popularized by the 
likes of “Call of Duty” and “Roblox” 
adds another level of stimulation 
and interactivity for children and 
teens alike. 

Fortnite takes advantage of both 

of these qualities and adds the third, 
most important element to the bunch: 
in-game purchases. Any regular 
person can play Fortnite, but the 
way to show prestige and expertise 
is with the trappings of professional, 
purchased costumes and dances with 
freshly minted V-bucks. In 2019, these 
microtransactions added $1.8 billion 
to Epic Games’s revenue.

And Fortnite’s player base did 

not materialize out of thin air — its 

popularity has exploded in recent 
years, and this has only been 
accelerated by the pandemic. As 
a result of strict social-distancing 
policies, playing “Fortnite” over voice 
or video chat with school buddies 
may very well be the most stimulating 
form of social interaction available 
to most e-kids. For a parent to deny 
their children these lifelines could be 
seen as unfair, even cruel, especially 
considering that the game itself is free 
(excluding in-application purchases).

Thus, the nature of Fortnite’s 

success is really not enigmatic at all. 
What was already a wildly popular 
game is now bolstered by such a high 
increase in demand that, for kids 
deprived of crucial social stimulation, 
Fortnite is somewhat of a necessity. 
Where the majority of kids with their 
parents’ credit cards go, businesses 
will follow, allowing “Fortnite” to 
create a metaverse of intellectual 
properties that could be the first of its 
kind.

Upon 
examination 
of 
every 

cultural medium that Fortnite ties 
together, from the NFL to popular 
DJs Marshmello and Major Lazer, 
TV shows like “The Walking Dead” 
and a wide collection of films, I find 
it almost reassuring that the game is 
able to introduce younger audiences to 
different forms of art and pop culture.

With so many brands eager to 

wedge themselves into Fortnite, Epic 
Games may be on its way to turning 
the game into an overstimulating 
post-capitalist hellscape. However, 
the game could be worse. At the very 
least, it keeps pop culture relics that 
are at risk of fading into irrelevance 
at the forefront of the video game 
industry. The possibility that Fortnite 
could be a kid’s first introduction 
to Sigourney Weaver’s character 
in “Alien” and the “Terminator” 
franchise is pretty strange, but at 
least it’s something. 

Of course, like anything fun and 

stimulating, playing the game comes 
with a risk — disillusioned parents 
have complained of crippling Fortnite 
addictions affecting their children. 
Maybe we will see a future where 
Fortnite does more harm than good, 
but right now, it’s a momentous force 
that’s worth keeping an eye on.

As many of you probably don’t 

know, I am a loyal watcher of the 
Emmy Award-winning, Friday-night 
making, reality TV show “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race.” I mostly tune in to the 
show every Friday night because the 
lip syncs and fashion are iconic, but 
also because an emotional backstory 
is my reality-TV kryptonite. 

Do I know anything about how to 

perform in drag? No. Did I once think 
that lip liner was a form of sharpie? 
Yes. But I am nevertheless entranced 
by the technical skills the queens 
bring to the stage, so I keep coming 
back. 

I say this because “Heartened 

Surfaces: The 2021 MFA Thesis 
Exhibition” and I have a similar 
relationship. I may not understand 
the complex nuance each artist 
brought to their projects. Yet it 
was still as thrilling to witness as 
“Drag Race.” Having the chance 
to go to an in-person gallery was 
the cherry on top for an exhibit 
that had almost everything I would 
typically look for — a little drama 
here, some camp there and a lot of 
artistry. 

So now I will delve into my tops 

and bottoms for the gallery, and 
just like the first half of season 13 of 
“Drag Race” — there are no losers, 
only winners, baby. So say “love” and 
start your engines for this review of 
“Heartened Surfaces.”

At the top this week are Christine 

Bruening’s “Permeable Bodies” and 
Rey Jeong’s “Screaming Yellow.” 
Bruening’s 
“Permeable 
Bodies” 

explores the intersection of the 
horror aesthetic and the artist’s own 
experience of fear and trauma. The 
artist’s body of work captures the 
camp nature of horror to the tee, 
using the broad strokes of the horror 
aesthetic as a foreground for her own 
experience. 

“Frankenstein and the Doctor,” 

also by Bruening, was one of my 
favorite pieces; it juxtaposes the 
artist’s fear of pregnancy with 
the discomfort of a “party-city” 
Frankenstein 
headpiece 
and 

cartoony green body paint, perfectly 
highlighting the innate discomfort of 
horror. 

This collection had high drama 

and a strong viewpoint to back it up, 
making Bruening my top toot (aka 
favorite artist) of the exhibit. 

Jeong’s “Screaming Yellow,” a 

social sculpture that talks about the 
experience of the Global Majority, 
also had its form of high drama 
in the form of a decked-out neon 
yellow truck. Yes, a real-life truck 
that looks like it just came out of “Jay 
Leno’s Garage.” It was definitely 
the centerpiece of the exhibition, 
catching my eye from the get-go. 

Jeong’s work felt immersive 

and full of color. The use of LED 
and neon lights highlighted the 
artificiality of the truck’s purpose 
as a fake grassroots campaign for an 
imaginary politician. This political 

motif offered a structure for the 
social sculpture, providing a literal 
platform for participants in Jeong’s 
work to express their emotions and 
voices through conversations, poetry 
and personal stories.

Unfortunately, along with my 

tops, I also have my bottoms of the 
week. Nathan Bryne’s “Equally 
Empty” lacked the payoff I had 
hoped for. Based on a graphite 
drawing by Dean Smith, Bryne’s 
piece was an immersive spatial 
encounter that used a soundscape 
by Emmerich Anklam, who is also 
known as Distant Reader, and 
Smith’s drawing as a foundation plan. 
Bryne’s installation felt magnetic at 
the center, the sound design along 
with the beautiful metalwork that 
accented the dark space bringing 
out the beauty in the still air. But as 
I began to move to the outer shell 
of the installation, it quickly lost its 
appeal. The piece needed to carry the 
energy to the ends of the installation, 
yet after that stunning center, the 
meandering wooden fences felt lost 
and tired.

The winner for the gallery 

challenge has to be Christine 
Bruening. Her work spoke to me the 
most out of all the pieces and made 
me want to find more on Bruening’s 
website. 

And the loser: YOU! Because 

you haven’t already gone to see it. 
Located at the Stamps Gallery in Ann 
Arbor, Mich., this gallery’s artists 
are giving me life, at least until next 
Friday’s episode of Drag Race.

Michigan’s Got Talent falls flat at promoting DEI

Design by Caitlin Martens


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Arts
6 — Wednesday, March 24, 2021 

Written, directed and produced 

by Wes Hurley (“Fallen Jewel”), 
“Potato Dreams of America” has 
been years in the making. The film, 
based on real events in Hurley’s life, 
has had different iterations, including 
a short, “Little Potato,” which won 
the documentary short Jury Prize at 
SXSW in 2020, and a VR short entitled 
“Potato Dreams.” But the runup to 
this film goes beyond its previous 
forms: Through its autobiographical 
format, the audience gets to see how 
film shaped the life of a young Hurley 
— and his proxy character Potato — 
throughout his life. 

Despite my initial misconception, 

the title doesn’t refer to dreams that 
are potato-based, but instead the 
action of dreaming done by Potato — 
his mother Lena’s pet name for him 
(the character’s actual name is Vasily, 
but since he is billed and referred to 
as Potato, I’m going to refer to him 
as such). The film follows the titular 

Potato and his mother through their 
immigration from Russia to America 
and 
his 
coming-of-age-while-

coming-out-as-gay 
experiences, 

using different actors and different 
filmmaking styles to tell it.

The first part of the film takes 

place in 1985 Russia. This portion uses 
obvious sets, bright colors, dramatic 
orchestral scores and caricatures 
— think Wes Anderson — to tell the 
story of Hurley’s Russian childhood 
in notably unaccented English. The 
character billed as “Russian Potato” 
(Hersh Powers, “Sadie”) and his 
mother, billed as “Young Lena” (Sera 
Barbieri, “Lightning”) navigate the 
conservative landscape of the Soviet 
Union (and the new freedoms that 
come once the Iron Curtain falls) 
through a fond attachment to movies 
and quick comedic timing. Their love 
for films makes its way into their joy 
for finding a third “renegade” channel 
on their TV that plays American 
movies and the fact that Lena briefly 
moves in with a man solely so she and 
Potato can experience his color TV.

This first part is staged almost like a 

play, with creative filmmaking choices 
that give this perception of childhood 
an almost whimsical feel. In an 
opening scene, a young Potato frames 
his arguing parents with his thumbs 
and forefingers, as a sort of imagination 
sequence. This instance of domestic 
abuse turns into a choreographed 
stage fight with a toddler-aged Potato 
watching from the audience. 

A moment where someone at 

school tells him to “take Jesus with 
him” prompts him to do just that: 
Potato creates an imaginary friend 
equivalent 
of 
Jesus 
(Jonathan 

Bennett, “Mean Girls”) and takes 
him by the hand into his apartment 
(truly, no one warned me that the love 
interest from “Mean Girls” would 
be playing a goofy, long-haired Jesus 
who yells at the TV and gives Potato 
bad advice). When his mother reads 
an advertisement to become a mail-
order bride, the background behind 
the window becomes the stage for an 
infomercial-type advertisement that 
is meant to take place in Lena’s head: 
“Are you tired of Russian men?” And 
as Lena wretchedly observes how she 

feels stuck — “Don’t you feel the walls 
closing in?” — it’s accompanied by 
rumbling and falling debris.

This brings us to the next part, 

where Lena’s participation in the 
mail-order bride program lands them 
the opportunity to come to America 
to live with a man named John (Dan 
Lauria, “The Wonder Years”). As 
they head to Seattle, Wash., to live 
with John, however, the film takes 
an abrupt turn. The filmmaking 
becomes more conventional, the 
cartoonish sets disappear and the 
actors for Potato and Lena change 
— Tyler Bocock (in his feature film 
debut) takes over as “American 
Potato” and Marya Sea Kaminski 
(“Pacific Aggression”) takes over as 
“American Lena.” These two new 
actors have heavy Russian accents, 
making it clear that this is no longer a 
staged and exaggerated recreation but 
instead a more standard narrative.

The new location brings new 

challenges for both Potato and 
Lena: the classic fish-out-of-water 
immigrant story, the going-to-a-new-
school story, the coming out story. 

More importantly, though, there’s 
the addition of John, the stepfather, 
who holds the threat of sending them 
back to Russia over their heads if their 
“values” don’t seem to align with his. 
The conflict is clear: If John were to 
discover Potato’s sexual orientation, 
they would be forced out of America. 
In this context, John holds all of the 
cards. 

While the staged sequences in 

Russia find humorous moments in 
their unconventionality — like, say, an 
ostentatious, glittery dance number 

that features the Virgin Mary tossing 
Baby Jesus to a backup dancer — the 
second part focuses on the subtle 
and sometimes unfunny comedy of 
everyday life, like a funny sequence 
where Potato tries to work up the 
nerve to check out a film from the 
“Gay and Lesbian” section of the video 
store. It also finds the beauty in their 
new home, with beautiful shots of the 
Seattle skyline. 

Not many people know Selma 

Blair. She has been, by her own words, 
“a supporting actress.” And maybe 
that’s why seeing her stripped raw 
in her documentary “Introducing, 
Selma Blair” means so much. In 
the documentary, she’s the main 
character — a real, living, breathing 
person who finally has the camera’s 
attention. 
Unfortunately, 
though, 

when the camera is on her, it’s not for 
something funny or happy like her 
role in “Legally Blonde.” Instead, it’s 
devastating and honest, because she is 
showing the audience she handles her 
Multiple Sclerosis.

What makes “Introducing, Selma 

Blair” so compelling is that no holds 

are barred. Honestly, I didn’t know 
much about MS prior to viewing this 
documentary but learning about it 
through Blair’s experience is truly 
shattering. Blair allows the audience 
to follow every step of her journey 
in which she reveals the good and 
the bad. Viewers get the fun, playful 
moments of her life, most of which 
center around her son Arthur, but 
also the moments of sheer exhaustion, 
unbearable 
pain 
and 
continual 

hopelessness. The jarring, abrupt 
shifts 
between 
those 
extremes 

provide the most meaningful glimpses 
into Blair’s life. One moment she could 
be jumping and laughing as she plays 
dodgeball with her son and the next 
moment has her in bed, so tired from 
playing she cannot move.

The film shifts in tone when it moves 

from Blair’s day-to-day moments to 

her progression through her stem cell 
transplant treatment, from preliminary 
chemotherapy 
to 
engraftment. 

The cell phone videos of Blair in the 
hospital, combined with traditional 
documentary footage, are tear-jerking 
in a way that few things can be. 

We see the emotional effects of the 

chemo in her visceral sadness and the 
physical effects of her treatment, the 
way that her body swells and she feels 
a pain that overtakes her. The audience 
is privy to a moving flashback where 
she explains that she had asked Arthur 
if there was anything that made him 
nervous about her treatment, and he 
had answered that he didn’t want 
her to lose her hair; she said, “Well 
then, I’ll just have you cut it, so that 
it’s not so surprising to you.” After the 
flashback, “Introducing, Selma Blair” 
moves to a tender scene of Arthur 

shaving her head with tendrils of hair 
encircling them both on the floor. 

In another clip, she winks at the 

camera as she administers her own 
injections. The camera follows her as 
she enters the hospital for a period of 
isolation. There’s a moment where 
the nurses, holding the stem cells 
that will be transplanted, are singing 
and saying a prayer as Blair’s eyes 
are closed tightly, internally praying 
alongside them that the transplant 
will work. These glimpses into her 
experience — into her life — paint a 
picture of who she is, what she has 
gone through and how strong she is 
for overcoming it all. The audience 
can never understand her pain, but 
by viewing this documentary, we are 
able to educate ourselves on MS and, 
more importantly, the people who 
persevere through it.

There isn’t a “happily ever after” 

once the treatment is over, and this 
offers a realistic understanding of 
Blair’s experiences. Following the 
treatment, she is disheartened that 
her recovery hasn’t happened in the 
way she expected. 

“I think I thought I was cured,” 

she says in a voiceover, as she, 
overwhelmed and crying, struggles 
to let herself into her hotel room after 
being discharged. In one of the most 
honest, melancholy sequences, Blair 
comes to the realization that her son 
(who had been living with his father 
while she was undergoing treatment) 
could potentially continue to live only 
with his father: “I don’t feel like I have 
to hold onto anything anymore,” she 
sobs. And then the scene cuts to Arthur 
bringing her flowers — another abrupt 
shift that only emphasizes her pain. 

Every moment of “Introducing, 

Selma Blair” is unchoreographed. 
Every moment is painfully real — 
sometimes so intimate that I felt like 
the audience should perhaps look 
away and let her exist without our 
eyes on her. 

The documentary closes with Blair 

still recovering. “I’m really depressed … 
I’m really struggling,” she says. “But at 
the same time, I realize … everyone is.” 

She reaches some semblance of 

closure even if she’s not fully there 
yet. And when the credits begin to 
roll, the audience wonders how she’s 
doing now. We hope that she’s happy 
and healthy … content in her own 
existence. The documentary does just 
as its name suggests: It introduces us 
to Selma Blair as the person she really 
is, featuring the good, the bad and 
everything in between. 

Dan 
Chiasson’s 
new 
poetry 

collection “The Math Campers” is not 
a volume that can be read passively. In 
fact, the very style and construction of 
the collection demand the participation 
of the reader. Instead of including 
dozens of different short poems, which 
is the norm for most poetry collections, 
“The Math Campers” contains several 
long-form poems over 20 pages long. 

Instead of wrapping up every poem 

nicely in one page, the poems take shape 
over time and space, meaning that 
the reader must make a concentrated 
effort to maintain focus. This can be 
difficult because the poems often have 
no clear beginning, middle or end. 
Freed from the constraints of linear 
narrative, 
Chiasson 
experiments 

with form and function. Lesser poets, 
perhaps, would get lost in the myriad 
voices and seemingly rambling trains of 
thought Chiasson incorporates, but he 
proves himself to have a true mastery of 
language and his own writing style.

As just one example of Chiasson’s 

playfulness with form, much of the 
first part of the collection, “Must 
We Mean What We Say,” is written 
in a back-and-forth quasi-epistolary 
format. Chiasson alternates between 
lyric form — “The sky was impossible, 
/ then our heads turned. / The noon 
midnight came / it came to us one by 
one.” — and prose — “He viewed the 
Druidical majesty of the eclipse from 
the stone steps of Memorial Church, 
and it was then, a source confirms, 
that he knew all about New England.” 

While at times the dialogue of 

the narrator and the unnamed 
correspondent seems grounded in 
reality, with details like “It was already 
November when he wrote again” and 
“Before the correspondence slowed 
that fall,” the end of the poem calls 
this reality into question in a way that 
makes the reader want to go back and 
read it from the beginning. 

The narrator writes, “It was 

painful to imagine that someone I 
had imagined had imagined me, and 
could simply stop, leaving me stranded, 
without oxygen, like an astronaut alone 
in deep space.” Suddenly a mysterious 
and often philosophical back-and-forth 
between two unknown characters 
becomes a meditation on the nature 
of reality itself. Chiasson asks us if 
we even exist if we do not exist in the 
minds of others: “Now, since he was 
gone, I was gone, and since I was gone, 

he was gone.”

After indirectly posing this question, 

Chiasson proceeds to directly involve 
the reader. He transitions to the use of 
“you,” a subtle grammatical shift that 
could be overlooked because it is often 
used as a general term instead of a 
specific one, especially in the context of 
a poetry collection. However, Chiasson 
quickly makes it clear that he means 
you, the person literally reading his 
words at that instant. He is wittily 
self-referential, writing, “By the way: I 
know what you know about me. / And 
by I, I mean me, the author, Dan.” 

He goes on to speak in an even 

more direct way to the reader, creating 
intimate moments that shock you into 
understanding. These are not just 
vague allusions to the author-reader 
relationship; Chiasson is specific 
and pointed, asking, “if the reader 
will please turn over / her hands to 
expose her palms / I will do so too and 
together, stranger / together we shall 
contemplate enormity.” 

Chiasson’s careful manipulation 

of reality and exploitation of the 
author-reader relationship create a 
space where the reader is an active 
participant in the poetry. We never 
know when the author will turn to 
us and expect us to contemplate our 
relationship with him next. As a result, 
we are always on edge, waiting to be 
written into the poem once again. 

At some point, we realize that the 

initial question — do we exist only if 
someone else is imagining us? — is 
answered by our own participation 
in the poetry. Chiasson writes, “if 
the reader will now step away from 
the page / if the reader will now step 
away from the screen / together we 
will ponder who imagined whom,” 
thus implicating us, the reader, in the 
central philosophical question. 

By 
digging 
deeper 
into 
the 

complexities of the author-reader 
relationship — the pact that is made 
between reader and author to agree to 
a shared reality, the relinquishment of 
the reader’s own reality and yielding 
to the author’s — Chiasson manages 
to take us one step further into his 
philosophical meditation by making 
the reader a participant. Focusing 
solely on Chiasson’s philosophical 
overtones would be a disservice to his 
writing, however. He is also incredibly 
talented in the most basic poetic 
skillset: simply creating beautiful and 
moving turns of phrase.

WHISPER


I sit at my grandma’s kitchen 

table –– as I do every Sunday –– and 
the routine is always the same. It’s 
usually me, my brother, my dad and 
my grandpa just sitting and talking, 
waiting for our food to come. My 
sister, however, is typically given the 
task of fetching our drinks, silverware 
and any other item necessary for our 
traditional Mexican meal. As we sit 
and wait, my grandma is scurrying 
around the kitchen trying to handle 
flipping tortillas, making guacamole, 
cooking the carne and setting the 
entire table. While these experiences 
are not unique to my family, they 
demonstrate the roles defined by 
machismo.

Machismo is defined as “a strong 

or exaggerated sense of manliness; 
an assumptive attitude that virility, 
courage, strength, and entitlement 
to dominate are attributed or 
concomitants 
of 
masculinity.” 

Derived from the Spanish word 
macho, this term too refers to the 
ideal societal role men are expected 
to play in their communities. 
Though machismo is another word 
synonymous 
with 
sexism 
and 

misogyny, it is also a strong and 
commonly-held belief in Hispanic 
communities that men are genuinely 
superior to women for the benefit 
of the family, work and society as 
a whole. This “role” assumes that 
the man is always seated at the 
head of the table, both figuratively 
and literally, to act as a protector 
of the family and to demonstrate 
dominance. On a societal level, 
the role of the macho functions as 
a collective group of dominating 

men in all spheres of life –– from the 
employment force to ruling political 
and economic institutions. Being 
macho is often framed as a good 
thing; in having a man as the head of 
the household, the power dynamic 
supposedly secures the safety of 
women and children from harm or 
danger. But who is actually safe? 

Machismo is often perpetuated 

through the way Hispanic men raise 
their children. In Hispanic cultures, 
there is really only one right way to be 
a man. You have to be a hard worker, 
knowledgeable in “manly” things –– 
from soccer and football to cars and 
tools. You have to use your skills to 
provide for your wife and kids. You 
can never ask for help. You have to be 
strong. You have to be a womanizer. 
You have to conform to notions and 
expectations of heteronormativity. 
And you, of course, have to follow the 
sexist gender norms that continue 
long-standing 
machismo 
within 

your family. Growing up as a kid 
and now an individual who does not 
identify as “macho” came with years 
of insecurity and wishing I was like 
others –– the more masculine men in 
my family and Hispanic communities. 
I remember watching my cousins 
play soccer, video games and enjoy 
learning about cars while I was more 
interested in reading about the world’s 
tallest skyscrapers and staying inside. 
It is no surprise that falling short of 
these expectations resulted in years 
of ridicule, shame and embarrassment 
from my male family members and 
other “macho” men in Hispanic 
communities. Whenever I compared 
myself to other Hispanic men who 
appeared to be more masculine 
than me, I always felt alienated and 
constantly feared further rejection 
from my family. Not only does this 

way of upbringing affect the mental 
health of Hispanic adolescents, it has 
also been associated with increased 
domestic and sexual violence. When 
social dynamics like machismo incite 
distress and violence, rather than 
protection and stability, they must be 
dismantled. 

Machismo has forced hundreds 

of 
generations 
of 
women 
to 

endure 
destructive 
masculinity. 

Domestically, many Hispanic women 
are assigned to the role of being the 
family’s homemaker before they are 
even born. A “macho” man would 
be shamed by his peers if he were to 
assume stereotypically female gender 
roles such as childcare, cooking and 
cleaning. These perceptions force 
millions of women with desires for 
careers outside of the home to be 
confined to a role that they do not 
necessarily desire, being told that this 
is the only place that they can provide 
value. Though women can aspire 
to be homemakers, they deserve 
the liberty to make this choice, free 
from cultural expectations. At such 
a young age, many Hispanic women 
are taught where they fall in the 
machismo ideology through learning 
the importance of household chores 

and domestic labor that only they 
must partake in. In my home, my sister 
and mother would wash the dishes 
and clean the house. Meanwhile 
me, my dad and my brother were 
assigned to landscaping and taking 
the 
garbage 
out. 
These 
early 

manifestations are implemented so 
that young girls are aware of their 
“purpose” within society and the 
family, thus silencing women and 
forcing them to forego many of their 
aspirations. Marianismo is the term 
that reflects these early teachings. 
Similar to machismo, marianismo 
refers to the ideal role women play 
at home and in a machismo society. 
Rooted in Christianity, marianismo is 
a direct consequence of the Hispanic 
patriarchal society and describes 
a woman as one who should be 
pure, pious and self-sacrificing –– 
attributes that best benefit the family 
and husband over herself. Due to 
the harmful presence men have had 
on Hispanic women for hundreds 
of years, it has upheld the social 
construct of marianismo, which 
further maintains machismo.

Let’s talk about hip-hop

We know the drill. Oh, you listen to 

rap? Name every rapper, ever. Know 
your lyrics and know your artists, or 
you are a fake fan. Never mind the fact 
that the self-righteous Brown boy that 
demanded you prove yourself derives 
his entire personhood from a genre of 
art that he blithely hyper-consumes 
for clout. And this popularity contest 
of who engages best with the newest 
trends in music, footwear and fashion 
is at the forefront of a majority of the 
hip hop consumer discourse today, in 
classic appropriation of Black culture. 
But hip hop encompasses an entire 
cultural movement that expresses 
people’s lived and political experiences 
across a variety of different art forms, 
from street art and fashion to music, 
dance and MCing. The musical style 
influences much of our mainstream 
media, popular culture and trends 
which are superficially consumed 
without a second thought. 

On March 11, TedXUofM hosted 

the “Conversations in hip hop” winter 
salon, which gave me a chance to 
consider my own (often mindless) 
consumption of rap music and 
appreciate the larger culture, history 
and breadth behind the genre of 
art. I was fascinated and inspired 
by the insight and wisdom of the 
panel of speakers including Kwasi 
Ampene, University of Michigan 
professor, author, filmmaker and 
ethnomusicologist; Elisandra Rosario, 
dancer, DJ, activist and filmmaker; 
Paul (Fifty) Johnson, graffiti and 
multidisciplinary artist; and Tonie 
Arcon, Business senior and a musician.

The panelists spoke about their 

first experiences with hip hop from 
The Sugarhill Gang’s quintessential 
“Rapper’s Delight” to Missy Elliott, 
Biggie Smalls and Tupac playing on 
the radio. In conversation with each 
other, they agreed on the curation of 
community and empowerment hip 
hop offers to those who engage with 

it. Arcon confessed that much of the 
foundation of his relationships with 
his roommates and his friends has 
been rooted in hip hop. 

“(It) brings people together … I 

think hip hop has that kind of effect,” 
Arcon said. 

Ampene spoke to the manifestation 

of this solidarity, discussing a brief 
history of West African hip hop and 
its function as a platform for the youth 
to speak on ongoing socio-political 
issues. “My journey (with hip hop) 
starts across the ocean,” he said. 

While we often associate the 

earliest traction of the movement to 
the Bronx, N.Y., Ampene discussed 
the long tradition of hip hop in West 
Africa 
through 
interconnected 

spiritual 
customs. 
According 
to 

Ampene, in West Africa, the hip 
hop movement was a form of public 
transcript and socially conscious 
dialogue, empowering the youth with 
a platform and empowering entire 
communities with its sacred roots in 
religion and gospel. 

He attributed the gap in historical 

knowledge about hip hop to the 
Westernized erasure of African hip 
hop tradition, demonstrated by the 
modern manifestation of hip hop in 
the United States through certain 
practices of consumption. 

This resonated with me, as I thought 

about the modern-day hip hop that 
I know well compared to its African 
spiritual roots that I hadn’t previously 
considered. To me, while much of 
production and creation of the art of 
hip hop itself encompasses its own set 
of Western social interpretations and 
ideals drawing from tradition, history 
and lived experience, the almost 
robotic Westernized perspective of 
some modern-day consumer practices 
focuses specifically on the American 
Dream as the human ideal, singularly 
fixating the narrative of hip hop on 
music about possession of money and 
hypersexualization of women alone.

An ode 

to the 
women 
in my 
life

I wanted to take the time to give 

thanks to the women I hold closest 

to me while we are still celebrating 

Women’s History Month. When I think 

about the women who have shaped me 

into the person I am today, my mind 

immediately takes me to my mother 

and two older sisters, who, in their own 

ways, have served as catalysts for my 

own personal growth. 

I commend my older sister, Uche, who 

carries herself as a free spirit, existing 

far beyond the confines of societal 

expectations. She pushes me to speak up 

even when I can’t seem to find the will 

to. She inspires me to reject the arbitrary 

social standards put upon me and live 

life by my own terms. She can always 

find a way to both clown me and shower 

me with praise in the same breath. She 

emboldens me to take no nonsense from 

anyone who chooses to treat me with 

disrespect. She is my unstoppable sister, 

a woman who fearlessly fights for me 

when I feel too weak to do so myself.

I appreciate my eldest sister, Kelechi, 

who possesses the utmost level of poise 

and composure. She has pulled me out 

of sticky situations far more times than 

I can count. She fiercely protects her 

younger sisters and brother no matter 

the circumstances. She can make 

any problem seem manageable after 

offering a nugget of her wisdom to me. 

I can always count on her for a warm, 

home-cooked meal whenever I return 

home from school. She rolls her eyes at 

my idealistic antics yet still encourages 

me to pursue my creative endeavors. 

She grounds me with common sense, 

reminding me to take things one step at 

a time whenever I feel overwhelmed by 

the weight of my responsibilities.

And I give the utmost thanks to my 

mother –– my guide and my rock. My 

mother, who always challenges me to 

be the very best version of myself. She 

reminds me of my capabilities whenever 

my feelings of imposter syndrome are 

particularly amplified. She teases me 

for flinching whenever she cornrows 

my hair, taming my kinky strands. She 

won’t hesitate to check on me whenever 

I’m not acting like my usual self. She 

maintains a rigid moral compass, only 

acting with truth and honesty. Her love 

for me maintains a certain constant in 

my life. My beautiful mother, who is akin 

to a superwoman, is able to conquer any 

and every curveball thrown her way. 

Words can only begin to describe the 

gratitude I have for these three women. 

Here’s to the resilient women in our 

lives; may we love them, cherish them 

and reflect their strength in everything 

we do.

The dilemma of an over-apologizer

Even when no one’s around, I 

mumble a sorry when I crash into the 
furniture. I say sorry when I ask my 
sister to buy Chick-fil-A on a Sunday. 
I write sorry as my final answer on 
my math homework. I say sorry when 
my friends say to stop apologizing so 
often. I am a chronic over-apologizer. 

To say sorry insinuates an apology, 

which is defined as an admission 
of error or regret. Simply put, when 
someone does something “wrong,” 
they would apologize with sorry. But 
what determines wrong? We all make 
mistakes. From the meanest to the 
sweetest person you know, they mess 

up at one point or another. There’s a 
wide range of mistakes we make as 
people because of things like natural 
forgetfulness or simply messing 
up because of circumstance. The 
important distinction is the impact 
of our errors and whether or not they 
affect others (like how missing an 
assignment only really affects me, 
but failing to complete my part of a 
group project hurts everyone else’s 
outcome). 

In group settings, the impact of 

one’s mistakes can cause arguments, 
misunderstandings 
or 
further 

complications. And when one realizes 
they are in the wrong, it is natural to 
feel guilt. I understand apologies, 
and, by extension, “sorry,” as a way 
of expressing feelings of guilt. In that 

same manner, it should not be easy 
to say sorry; I don’t believe a lot of 
people enjoy admitting their mistakes. 
People still say sorry, however, in 
hopes of reconciling any issues 
between themselves and others. It is a 
fundamental form of communication. 

Yet I say sorry when there’s 

no need. I blurt out the word as a 
common courtesy in my texts and 
emails. I say sorry after my mom helps 
me find my glasses. I write out sorry 
on Piazza before asking my question 
because I am worried it is a dumb 
one. I admit there are times I say sorry 
out of politeness or habit, rather than 
actually meaning it. That’s the worst 
thing I can do. In saying it so often, 
and equating all of my mistakes to 
the same single “sorry,” my apologies 

become less and less effective. 

Don’t get me wrong, when I say 

sorry in more serious contexts, I 
do genuinely mean it and hope that 
sincerity is clear in my apologies. It is 
still a valid way for me to acknowledge 
my mistakes and express my sorrow 
towards others. The real issue with 
over-apologizing is how I perceive 
“sorry” in other contexts. I fail to see 
sincerity in the apologies I receive 
because I am used to throwing it 
around left and right. It has made 
it difficult for me to accept the 
significance behind an apology, 
because I’ll always question if they 
are an over-apologizer too. I can’t 
help but wonder if they truly feel sorry 
and are admitting to their mistakes 
or are simply saying because it is just 

“the right thing to say’’ –– just as I do 
sometimes. 

This reminds of a few weeks ago 

when I got a text saying “I am truly 
sorry” from an old friend. Even 
though he had apologized and I knew 
him to use “sorry” sparingly, I was 
still debating the genuineness of his 
apology. It might have had to do with 
how it was a two-year late apology 
and over text. Or the fact that his next 
few texts focus on how great of a show 
“Euphoria” is. It bothered me how it 
probably took him a second to type 
out the word “sorry.” His keyboard 
may have even automated the apology. 
Altogether, the word “sorry” didn’t feel 
sufficient enough to me. His apology 
might have been genuine, but I could 
not accept it, let alone believe in it. 

But, what exactly could he have 

said or done to make a more genuine, 
better apology? There are not that 
many substitutes for “sorry” in the 
English language. He could have said 
“my bad” or “my fault,” but I would 
not have appreciated those phrases 
any more than the literal word “sorry” 
— in fact those other phrases would 
have made me feel worse. There’s 
other extra things people can add to 
their apologies, including adverbs or 
a full outlining of what they are sorry 
for, but the key word of an apology 
is “sorry.” It is the most basic way to 
summarize deep regret or guilt about 
one’s actions.

Thrifting is For You
When did everyone get so into 

thrifting?

Scrolling through my TikTok, the 

zeitgeist of Generation-Z culture, the 
majority of my For You Page has been 
flooded with thrifting videos. I feel like 
I’ve seen all the thrifting Tik Toks possible 
at this point. A middle schooler explaining 
how her outfits of the day are sourced 
from Goodwill. A college student’s 
clothing hauls showcasing the latest finds 
from Salvation Army. A high schooler 
explaining how shopping second-hand 
helps the environment while creating 
a unique killer wardrobe. Interspersed 
throughout these videos are lip-syncs 
and comedy bits, and while watching, I 
couldn’t stop thinking about how much I 
wanted to go thrifting.

Back in the ‘90s, my mom would go to 

Value World in Ypsilanti, Mich., with her 
college friends to look for Levi’s. Now, 
decades after my mom, LSA sophomore 
Rita Sayegh visits that same Value World 
with her friends. Now, it’s not surprising 
to hear of high school and college students 
thrifting on the weekends, but it was 
at one point. In the late 90s to the mid-

2000s, fast-fashion labels dominated the 
fashion industry. Hedonistic consumption 
of clothing was at its peak; Zara, H&M, 
Forever 21 and more were more than 
willing to feed societal haste. These brands 
are the pinnacle of fast fashion, because 
Zara, H&M and Forever 21 provide the 
latest trends off the runway in a cheap, 
quick manner. However, the trend began 
to shift as Gen Z grew older. A Deloitte 
study on individuals born between 1995-
2012 (Gen Z) theorized that the Great 
Recession shaped the age group to become 
more focused on financial security and 
pragmatic about finances and as a result, 
willing to shop at thrift stores to score 
clothing goods at a better price. Others 
have reasoned that the rise of social 

media has normalized and popularized 
secondhand clothing as seen through its 
prevalence on social media apps. Some 
speculate that the growing climate crisis 
has forced Gen Z to look more critically 
at their carbon footprint and refrain from 
supporting fast fashion and its terrible 
impact on the environment.

Fast Fashion and Lasting Issues
Thrift shops have provided college 

and high school students with new 
opportunities in fashion. One of these 
opportunities is to create a more 
intentional lifestyle that minimizes the 
impact on the environment. For LSA 
sophomore Brendan Bontrager, shopping 
at the Salvation Army started out as a way 
to find pieces for a Halloween costume or 
a themed party. Bontrager didn’t consider 
thrifting as a resource for his actual 
wardrobe. That began to change in college 
when he became aware of the nature of 
fast fashion. 

“I used to think of environmental harm 

as oil companies,” Bontrager said. “But I 
became aware of how fast fashion harms 
the environment (and) how H&M has 
unethical working conditions.” 

As Bontrager discusses, fast fashion 

creates various societal and ethical issues. 
Due to its cheap prices, clothing factories 
cut corners to keep manufacturing 
cheap, 
underpaying 
workers 
and 

creating hazardous work environments. 
However, the harm does not stop 
there. Fast fashion has also fed into the 
climate crisis. According to the World 
Resources Institute, textile production 
releases around 1.2 billion tons of carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere per year, 
which is linked to global warming and 
is responsible for 10% of total global 
emissions.

These issues forced Bontrager to 

look toward other clothing options, but, 
like many, he ran into the issue of cost. 
Retailers like Patagonia, Reformation 
and Boden create clothing with minimal 
environmental impact and ethical labor 
conditions, but it comes at a steep cost to 
the consumer. For high school and college 

students, these costs can be a deterrent for 
shopping sustainably. Bontrager realized 
that he could turn to the Salvation Army 
or Goodfair, an online thrift store retailer, 
for his clothing needs without forgoing his 
passion for sustainability. 

Youtube Girls
In Sayegh’s case, she developed this 

interest in thrifting through her love 
of YouTube. Sayegh said that in her 
childhood she watched a lot of YouTube 
and she “would see the YouTube 
girls thrifting all the time,” referring 
to creators like Liza Koshy, Emma 
Chamberlain, Hannah Meloche, Ashley 
Rous and others that began posting 
videos centered around thrifting about 
three years ago. The most popular 
video, 
“THRIFTING 
BRANDS!! 

GOODWILL 
WITH 
GREATLIZA,” 

from Liza Koshy has about 15.4 million 
views. Comparatively, the most popular 
clothing haul videos centered around 
Zara, H&M and Forever 21 have barely 
half as many views as many of the thrift 
haul videos — the most popular Zara haul 
video amassing only 3.1 million views. 
Thrifting became more mainstream as 
a result of young viewers watching their 
favorite internet personalities finding 
great pieces of clothing for cheap prices. 

The change in attitude was noticeable 

for LSA sophomore Abigail Miars, the 
owner of the clothing resale store Umich 
Apparel. Growing up in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., Miars frequently went with her 
father to garage sales and began shopping 
at thrift stores in 2014, but she never felt 
comfortable attributing her wardrobe to 
thrift stores until recently. 

“A couple years back, (thrift stores had) 

a negative connotation that you couldn’t 
afford (new) clothes if you shopped at the 
Salvation Army,” Miars said. But around 
two years ago, Miars realized that the 
conversation 
surrounding 
thrifting 

began to skew more positively and has 
grown into a massive industry of its own.

Do the Hustle
The resale industry has been growing 

rapidly. In 2019, it was estimated that the 
industry was worth $24 billion, outpacing 
traditional retail stores in growth over 
the years. At the center of this growth 
are students. Young adults have begun 
reselling clothing as a side hustle, an 
avenue worth pursuing for extra money. 
These students will come into thrift 
stores and buy in bulk. Then, they will 
“flip” the clothing by customizing their 
thrift finds, a process in which they crop 
the shirt or dye it or sew it into different 
articles of clothing entirely. Then, they 
typically post the clothes on a special 
Instagram account or a resale app like 
Poshmark or Depop to sell it. 

In honor of Women’s History Month, I 

wanted to offer an ode to the most important 
woman in my life, my Amma. 

As a homemaker, my Amma is constantly 

on her feet, 24/7/365. To gain more insight into 
everything she has to do, I recently sat down 
with her and simply asked her, “What’s your 
schedule every day?”

She stared blankly, and after a couple of 

seconds, responded, “I don’t know.” I asked 
her again, phrased differently, “What do you 
do every day?” She stared blankly again and 
simply said, “Just sit around. I don’t do much. 
It’s not like I have a job.”

My Amma never gives herself enough credit. 

I knew sitting down with her and asking her to 
talk about herself wasn’t going to help me write 
this narrative. But I don’t usually see my Amma 
in action, given the fact that for most of the day, 
I am in school or away from home. The only 
information I have managed to accumulate has 
been from asking throughout the years, “How 
was your day today, Amma?” 

All of my Amma’s days are busy, and I can 

intensely recall the busyness that filled her 
days from 2011-2012 when my father’s parents 
stayed with us. So, to the best of my ability, I 
will attempt to convey everything my Amma 
did in a day in those years.

6:00 a.m.: She would wake up and get ready 

for the day.

6:30 a.m.: She would do pooja, the Hindu 

act of saying prayers. My Amma always made 
sure to pray for our health and happiness. My 
grandmother would also be awake during this 
time, doing pooja of her own. My Amma made 
sure my grandmother had everything she 
needed. 

7:00 a.m.: She would make lunch for my 

younger brother, my father and me. My brother 
and I never woke up in time to make it to the bus 
stop, let alone make and pack our own lunches. 

7:15 a.m.: She would wake my brother and 

me up for school. We always slept through 
our alarm clocks, so our Amma was the only 
reliable alarm we had. Soon after, she would 
pick out our outfits. I don’t know how to dress 
now, so you can imagine how rough it was when 
I would attempt to pick out my own outfits 
between the ages of 10 and 12. My Amma was, 
and very much still is, my stylist, making sure I 
don’t look like a clown every day. 

7:45 a.m.: She would make sure we were 

ready to take on the day. Amma would braid 
my hair every morning. I was awful at doing 
my own hair. In fact, I didn’t even know how 
to braid my own hair until my freshman year 
of high school, so I relied on my Amma to 
do my hair for me every single morning. As 
she brushed out all of its tangles and knots, 
slathering the infamous Parachute coconut 
oil along the way, she would ask us if we put 
our homework in our bags and ensure we had 
our water bottles. She would check to see if 
we picked up our lunchboxes she made from 
the kitchen counter and if we wanted to eat 
something before we left for the bus. Finally, 
she would take a breath for herself as the bus 
entered our neighborhood, and my brother and 
I would give our hugs and kisses and make our 
way to school. This was her only break before 
moving on to her next set of tasks for the day. It’s 
funny — this would be the moment I considered 
the beginning of my day. Meanwhile, my Amma 
would have been up and moving for almost 2 
hours at this point. 

8:00 a.m.: She would finish preparing a pot 

of coffee. My father would be up and getting 
ready for work at this point, so now my Amma 
made sure he would be ready to take on his 
day. This is also when my Amma had to think 
about what to make for lunch for herself and 
my grandparents. On top of being vegetarian, 
my grandparents do not eat eggs, onions or 
garlic. And no, not even onion powder or garlic 
powder. My Amma had to be creative to find 
something new to make for them each day. 

8:30 a.m.: She would make sure my father 

has his water bottles, his coffee, his ID, his 
phone, his wallet and his keys. After he leaves, 
my Amma could finally take another breather. 
Immediately after she exhaled, she would need 
to start making lunch.

9:00 a.m.: She would make lunch for herself 

and my grandparents while making sure my 
grandparents are comfortable, not too cold and 
all-around feeling well.

10:00 a.m.: She would set the table with 

water, napkins and a placemat. My Amma’s pet 
peeve is when her tablecloths get messy. 

10:30 a.m.: She would sit down with my 

grandparents as they eat lunch, making sure 
they have everything they need. My Amma 
would usually wait until after they were done 
eating to eat herself, so she could accommodate 
any of their needs as they ate. 

June 2020 was a time in which my 

mind wandered between wondering 
and worrying. As the summer months 
progressed, I spent my time constantly 
wondering when my days would cease 
to be relegated to the boundaries of my 
parents’ house, with the exception of an 
occasional walk around my neighborhood 
to get a change of scenery and keep my 
body moving. Moments that weren’t 
spent wondering about my future were 
spent worrying about it. Key moments 
and aspects of my life such as my college 
experience, graduation and the nature of 
my personal relationships all had question 
marks by them, and existing in this space 
of uncertainty riddled me anxious. At the 
same time, the socio-political world that I 
was immersed in was undergoing a similar 
tug-of-war. It was one that took place 
between those who prioritized controlling 
the spread of the virus and those who were 

focused on reviving the U.S. economy. The 
former group was willing to endure hits to 
the stock market for the sake of saving lives. 
The latter, on the other hand, desired the 
immediate reopening of businesses, despite 
the health risks such actions would cause, 
especially for non-white communities. 
Around this time, I, along with my peers, 

wondered what side the University of 
Michigan would be on. 

On June 22, 2020, we got our answer. 

It was on that day University President 
Schlissel announced that the University 
was planning to have a public-health-
informed fall semester. According to 
that day’s announcement, this would 
include a mix of online and in-person 
classes, residence halls and dining halls 
that would still be open to serving and 
housing students and an availability of 
activities that would enhance the student 
experience. The promise of a semi-regular 
semester placed a glimmer of hope in many 
students, myself included. After months 
of having virtually no social interaction 
outside of those I lived with, I marveled 
at the opportunity of being able to once 
again be immersed in a world of my peers. 
What made the deal sound even sweeter 
was the fact that both the president’s 
announcement and the resulting Maize 
and Blueprint webpage announced not 
only an expected return to campus, but 
also a promise to utilize effective public 

health measures, such as the expectation 
of social distancing and mask-wearing 
along with some level of COVID-19 testing, 
and a provision of quarantine housing in 
case students contracted the virus. This 
plan was marketed as a way to have the 
best of both worlds –– safety and the 
quintessential college experience. Maybe it 

was possible to fulfill these two seemingly 
opposed priorities.

This sense of cautious optimism was 

not long-lived. Within two weeks of move-
in day, it was clear that the plan to ensure 
proper social distancing, mask wearing 
and other safety measures among students 
relied mainly on circulating a set of 
guidelines that students were encouraged 
to follow for the sake of themselves and 
those around them. 

The only attempt that was made to 

enforce these public health practices 
came in the form of a student ambassador 
program, an initiative in which students 
who underwent an assigned training 
module were chosen to patrol campus 
neighborhoods to encourage students to 
follow proper public health safety measures. 
These ambassadors did not have the 
authority to enforce or deter any changes in 
the recurring instances of unsafe behavior 
such as partying or Fraternity & Sorority 
Life 
activities. 
However, 
concerning 

observations made by the ambassadors 
would be reported to the Division of Public 
Safety and Security, which initially would 
employ armed officers to de-escalate the 
situation. The use of minimally-trained 
students and police personnel to enforce 
guidelines brought about very reasonable 
concern about the potential of implicit bias 
and police harassment towards Black and 
brown students on campus. The threat of 
this program to the safety of non-white 
students was especially heightened at this 
time given the widely publicized instances of 
police brutality –– and the resulting protests 
–– that took place during the summer and 
beyond. The lack of trust and understanding 
between those administering the program 
and those who were supposed to be 
benefiting from it caused the program 
to not last beyond the first semester of its 
installation. The overall insensitive nature 
of the program, along with the increased 
sense of caution of police presence, ignited 
resistance of the student ambassadors from 
many student groups, which eventually led 
to the recalling of this program.

In defense of the female gamer

When people think of gamers, they usually 

picture a man sitting in his bedroom –– 
sheets everywhere, food all over his desk, 
clothes scattered across his room as he yells 
through his headset for his teammates to 
come save him. Men are allowed to be messy, 
obscene and obnoxious when they play video 
games. They can stream the video game 
missions they pursue through various online 
platforms like YouTube and Twitch and rack 
up millions of views within a day. However, I 
have noticed when women stream the video 
games they play, they are more likely to face 
sexist comments from viewers about their 
appearance. Women who game overall are four 
times more likely than their male counterparts 
to be harassed while playing online. For 
example, when Pokimane, a female gamer with 
over 7.1 million followers, had a makeup free 
streaming event, she received comments that 
called her “disgusting,” “ugly” and implied that 
she “catfished” her viewers. A female gamer 
is also required to take into consideration her 
relationship status and appear available in 
order to cater to her male audience. Another 
instance of sexism in the gaming industry 
can be seen with women not revealing their 
gender in order to be seen as a “bro” to avoid 
harassment from men online.

In my experience, I have been told that I am 

not a part of the gaming community for playing 
games like Animal Crossing and Stardew 
Valley because they are “too feminine” to 
be considered a valid game to be streamed 
because of their low level of difficulty. They are 
considered unworthy to be streamed because 
they do not involve harming an opponent and 
blood and fighting scenes, all of which are 
characteristics of video games whose main 
target audience are men. Though Animal 
Crossing is not marketed as a game for women, 
the people around me perceive it as one 
because of its charming aspects such as fishing 
or tending a garden due to traditional gender 
roles. In my experience, men do not believe 
that growing different colors of flowers on an 
island takes as much precision and execution as 
finding and attacking a target in a field.

Women, both as game characters and real 

humans, are oversexualized by male streamers 
and held to fantastical standards. In most video 
games, the female characters are always seen 
as innocent, thin women with slim waists and 
big breasts, sharing similar physical attributes 
with 
anime 
figures. 
This 
unattainable 

expectation of women’s appearance becomes a 
part of everyday reality when male participants 
interact with women on Twitch streams. Data 
provided by an Indiana University study shows 
that the average female streamer is more likely 
to receive comments involving words such as 
“hot,” “boobs” and “cute” while the average 
male streamer’s comments contain vocabulary 
much more centered around the game he is 
playing. These comments are a result of men 

in the gaming industry becoming accustomed 
to seeing unrealistic, sexualized female bodies 
while playing video games and then expecting 
women 
to 
mimic 
those 
characteristics 

outside of the streaming world and within the 
professional gaming industry. 

Female streamers are oversexualized in 

the gaming industry primarily because the 
industry itself is dominated and controlled by 
men who perpetuate these harmful narratives. 
For example, Bella Poarch, a new streamer, has 
been subjected to hate and backlash from social 
media for her facial expressions in TikTok lip 
sync videos, which critics claim is promoting 
a child-like image solely to garner attention 
from men. The problem here is not Poarch or 
her facial expressions, but rather society and 
the hyper-sexualization of women starting 
from a young age. When a woman acts cute 
and happy, she is not encouraging men to prey 
on young women — she is simply being herself. 
Having a childlike or innocent demeanor isn’t 
an invitation to be sexualized. Male gamers 
need to allow women to be themselves.

This oversexualization has made it difficult 

for female gamers to enjoy their hobbies and 
stream the content they wish to share. Now 
when women go to stream video games, viewers 
assume that they are “boobie streamers” — 
women who supposedly wear low cut tops 
and receive targeted sexual comments in 
exchange for money and subscribers for their 
channel. There is nothing wrong with a woman 
getting her bag or wearing what she likes, but it 
becomes an issue when the male gaze pressures 
her to do so for validation as a gamer. This 
makes many women feel pressured to fulfill 
such sexist expectations because they learn 
that being oversexualized is one of the only 
ways to climb to the top of the gaming industry. 

Male streamers do not have to worry 

about being oversexualized or changing their 
personality online because their community 
does not view them purely as a sexual object. 
They are free to play any video games they 
want without being told that they are not a 
“real gamer.” During their streams, viewers 
are focused on the hacks the streamer is 
teaching them and how engaging they are 
with the crowd. On the other hand, women are 
subjected to harassment, unsolicited messages 
and threats from men when playing online.

As a community, we need to look at the way 

we treat women who stream and game and 
begin to show them the respect they deserve 
for their craft. Women continuously have to 
go above and beyond in all work settings in 
order to prove themselves, and the gaming 
community is no exception. This double 
standard of female streamers having to live up 
to this idea of perfection, while men are able 
to simply show up, has to end. Women can be 
gamers without streaming games that are gory 
or bloody. Women should have the freedom to 
stream whatever they want without having to 
feel like they will be left out.

7-Opinion

M

y worst habit involves 
reading the comments 
and quote tweets on 

The New York Times articles about 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations. 

They are, without fail, a dumpster 
fire of victim blaming. However, 
given 
the 
well-corroborated 

account of New York Gov. Andrew 
Cuomo’s sexual harassment of 
former aide, Charlotte Bennett, I 
thought the discourse might reflect 
reality. 

No such luck. 
It doesn’t matter that the 

simplest explanation is that Cuomo 
did, in fact, do what he’s accused 
of, at least in the case of Bennett. 
For some, it is apparently easier to 
believe that Bennett lied to both 
Cuomo’s Chief of Staff and the 
administration’s special counsel 
and 
planted 
contemporaneous 

text messages to several different 
people only to sit on the lies for 
months to wait for a convenient 
time to let them blossom. I haven’t 
heard anyone outright suggest that 
she did all of those things, even 
defenders of Cuomo, probably 
because it would be ridiculous. 
Skeptics of sexual misconduct 
allegations hold themselves to a 
low standard. It is simple to invoke 
a horrible hypothetical without 
considering 
publicly 
available 

information, but that doesn’t make 
it smart or logical.

For some, it seems it is 

easier to believe that Cuomo’s 
lack of a categorical denial is 
inconsequential. 
However, 

Cuomo 
has 
denied 
other 

allegations — his press secretary 
called an earlier allegation of 
sexual harassment by a different 
woman “quite simply false.” In 
other words, if he could plausibly 
deny Bennett’s accusation, his 
own history indicates that he 
would. To me, the cries that 
Bennett is lying or that we must 
wait to pass judgment ring 
hollow. Cuomo has rights within 
the American legal system, but in 
the court of public opinion, I don’t 
know what stops people from 
simply being rational. 

Cuomo 
even 
issued 
a 

pseudo-apology, 
emphasizing 

that he never touched anyone 
inappropriately (Bennett does not 

accuse him of touching her) but 
that he may have made people feel 
uncomfortable without knowing 
he was doing so. Whether he 
intended to harass Bennett is 
irrelevant to her experience of 
harassment. 

So let’s recap: Cuomo is accused 

of sexual harassment, and the 
accuser has an extensive paper trail 
to back up her claim. Cuomo has 
not denied all the allegations but 
has issued something that appears 
to be an apology. Same page? 

I believe Charlotte Bennett 

because I am typically far more 
willing to risk the small chance 
that someone who has experienced 
sexual misconduct or harassment is 
lying than the much larger chance 
that they are is telling the truth. 
In refusing to believe a survivor, 
one makes their worst nightmare 
even harder. You should believe 
Bennett, and the other women 
making 
accusations 
against 

Cuomo, because they are believable 
allegations. 

There is more research on the 

instances of false allegations of 
rape (somewhere between 2-10% 
are false) than instances of false 
allegations of harassment, but 
given it all falls under the umbrella 
of sexual misconduct, similar 
principles likely apply. Yes, false 
allegations are rare, but even the 
ones that do happen do not look 
like what Bennett asserts. For 
example, studies have repeatedly 
shown that a common type of 
false allegation is one that comes 
from a teenage girl looking to 
avoid trouble with her parents. 
In those cases, it is almost always 
the parents who get authorities 
involved, after which the truth 
usually comes out pretty quickly. 
Another common type of false 
allegation comes from those who 
use it in order to obtain medical 
care or medication.

False accusers, much like real 

perpetrators, also often show 
a string of similar behavior. 
They may have a history of 
filing personal injury claims or 
committing fraud. But the most 
important characteristic of most 
false allegations is that, if they were 
true, they would be can’t-look-away 
horrifying (which is certainly not 

to say that horrifying allegations 
can’t also be true). These are 
the 
aggravated 
assault 
cases; 

the University of Virginia case 
documented in the now infamous 
Rolling Stones article is a good 
example.

False accusers want shock and 

action, so they wouldn’t make 
an accusation like the one made 
by Bennett, which involves no 
physical violence and one which 
any woman with access to the 
internet would know would be 
met with a solid contingent of 
people questioning whether or 
not it was ‘actually bad.’ 

Some may say it doesn’t matter 

whether they believe Bennett 
because Cuomo deserves due 
process anyway. For the wealth 
of other allegations that have 
been made, allegations which he 
disputes, I would agree. But the 
original calls for an investigation 
arose after Bennett came forward. 

As author and lawyer Alexandra 

Brodsky points out, investigations 
are for disputes and, insofar as she 
can tell, there is no dispute here. 
Bennett said she was sexually 
harassed, and Cuomo conceded 
that what he did might have 
made 
others 
uncomfortable. 

“Uncomfortable” is euphemistic, 
but it definitely isn’t a denial. 

Even if Cuomo manages to 

dodge the ever-growing chorus 
of voices asking him to resign, 
the question of whether we 
believe Bennett matters now. The 
investigation provides him time 
to let news cycles pass, to let other 
scandals take precedent. 

The 
investigation 
into 
a 

matter which the governor has 
seemingly 
already 
apologized 

for shifts the conversation from 
an 
uncomfortable 
one 
about 

workplace ethics to a familiar one 
about procedure. The conversation 
we need to be having is this: In 
the plausible event that Bennett’s 
accusations are true, what should 
happen? 

He should resign. And all of the 

not-that-bad naysayers need to take 
a hard look at their own workplace 
behavior.

F

ar from the 1960s American 
promise of a nuclear family — 
a heterosexual couple, their 2 

to 3 children and a stable unionized 
job with a guaranteed pension — 
college students now face a complex 
and troubling outlook. Today, many 
American 
college 
students 
and 

recent graduates are confronted by 
egregious student loans, a significant 
barrier to economic mobility in the 
United States. 

Not only are excessive loans a 

driving reason for students to drop 
out of school, but over half of indebted 
graduates claim that their loans 
have decreased their credit scores 
and forced them to delay saving for 
emergencies. 
Unfortunately, 
the 

brunt of this burden is on minority 
communities. 
Specifically, 
Black 

college graduates on average owe 
$25,000 more than their white 
counterparts. These diverse students 
have 
fewer 
job 
opportunities, 

contributing to the fact that default 
rates are 36% and 49% among 
Hispanic 
and 
Black 
borrowers, 

respectively, compared to just 21% 
among whites.

This amounts to an American 

crisis affecting the way 53% of 
borrowers choose their careers. It 
also decreases entrepreneurship and 
overall economic consumption while 
precipitously increasing household 
debt, and the problem is only getting 
worse, with student debt slowly 
encroaching on overall household 
spending.

In 2019, the average student 

owed $30,062 upon graduation, 
which represents about a 26% 
increase over the last decade. 
Furthermore, the average 2019 
college graduate makes $53,889 
per year. The average loan payment 
is $393 per month, which means 
that the average graduate uses 
8.75% of their yearly salary on loan 
repayment. Compounding on this, 
recent graduates of color typically 
have fewer opportunities for recent 
graduates. 

Now, while it is easy to dismiss 

this as an issue plaguing some 
individuals who were swindled 
into signing onto unaffordable 
loans, this is actually a systemic 
failure that has spiraled into a 

crisis that threatens our economy 
on multiple levels. At the micro-
level, college dropouts make 35% 
less than graduates, which, in 2011, 
amounted to $3.8 billion per year 
in lost wages and likely more in lost 
economic output. At the macro-
level, the federal government 
holds $1.5 trillion in student loan 
debt,accounting 
for 
29.8% 
of 

all government assets. Holding 
these high-risk assets is costing 
taxpayers $170 billion from 2017 to 
2026. The current trajectory of this 
crisis, especially due to the onset 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, is 
untenable. Our government needs 
to formulate a comprehensive, 
multi-pronged 
approach 
to 

mitigate this impending crisis 
and develop more opportunities 
for economic mobility through 
education.

Now, many at the federal 

level have devoted a significant 
amount of time and effort to fix 
the problem, specifically proposals 
from Sens. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
for the cancellation of student debt. 

While both of these are admirable 
efforts that would make the 
problem better than it is currently, 
there are two main issues. 

Primarily, the idea is politically 

infeasible. But even if it weren’t, it 
would only provide an economic 
multiplier of 0.08x to 0.23x, which 
are both low returns — especially 
relative to infrastructure spending 
that provides a 1.6x multiplier 
in a recession. Instead, many on 
the more moderate end of the 
spectrum have chosen to advocate 
for modest reforms like increasing 
the availability of Pell Grants or 
switching the system to income-
based loan repayment, both of 
which would help mitigate the 
crisis.

With that being said, I personally 

prefer a more market-based solution. 
Specifically, to free working capital, 
the 
federal 
government 
should 

increase the scope of the current 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness 
program. Currently, PSLF forgives 
federal student loans for those who 
have paid loans on time and worked 
for ten years in the government, a 

nonprofit, AmeriCorps or the Peace 
Corps. However, if the government 
were to expand the program through 
a public-private partnership, they 
could vastly increase the number 
of jobs that are available to recent 
graduates and decrease the amount 
of outstanding student loan debt.

The system could operate in four 

different funding categories: large 
and medium-sized businesses (above 
100 employees), small businesses 
(100 employees and under), 501(c)(3) 
nonprofits and state governments 
and federal agencies. All businesses 
participating must meet certain 
diversity 
standards 
and 
a 
$15 

minimum wage. 

In 
exchange, 
the 
federal 

government 
would 
introduce 
a 

matching program: providing 50% of 
the new hires’ salaries (up to $50,000 
per year per employee) in treasury 
bonds at large and medium businesses, 
75% of the new hires’ salaries (up 
to $75,000 per year per employee) 
in subsidies at small businesses and 
nonprofits and a Medicaid-like dollar-
for-dollar matching program with 
state governments.

In order to incentivize students to 

go into small businesses, nonprofits 
and 
government 
careers, 
PSLF 

requirements would be altered based 
on the category. For small businesses 
and government, students would 
have to work for seven years. For 
nonprofits, students would only have 
to work for five years.

This desperately needed update 

to the PSLF would free students 
from the shackles of student loans 
more quickly while ensuring that the 
backers of these loans retrieve their 
principal. This, in turn, would create 
a large multiplier whose shockwaves 
would be felt across the nation, 
providing a sustainable roadmap for 
long-term growth. 

With that being said, there are 

many other ways of fixing this 
uniquely American problem, and, 
no matter your ideology, you should 
do the research and get behind one 
solution to student debt — our elected 
officials won’t fix this issue unless we 
make them.

U

niversity 
of 
Michigan 

students are bad at failing. 
While there is no doubt 

that we form a community of 
extraordinary go-getters, it is often a 
fear of failure, rather than a passion 
for success, that propels us. In a 
highly-competitive academic setting, 
these fears may develop into chronic 
academic performance anxiety when 
left unchecked. Ironically, a formidable 
solution to our anxieties is to get better 
at doing badly. Here’s how. 

Picture yourself receiving a high 

grade on a test after several grueling 
nights of preparation. “It was all 
worth it,” you acknowledge, beaming. 
Now picture yourself failing that 
same test despite your hours-long 
commitment. Feeling the hole in your 
chest widening, you think to yourself, 
“it was all for nothing,” and you 
criticize yourself for not being capable 
enough. You dedicated the same 
amount of determination and labor in 
both scenarios. Yet, your evaluation 

of the worth of your labor is entirely 
dependent upon the final outcome. 

When our appreciation of our effort 

is entirely conditional like this, our 
sense of worth hinges on an imagined 
outcome that may never unfold the 
way we planned, no matter how much 
we went through in the hopes of 
achieving it. Subsequently, when we 
fail, we feel that it speaks to who we are 
as a person, and this outlook ultimately 
puts us farther away from our goals 
than failure itself does. 

When we permit our failures to 

intersect with our core sense of identity 
and self-esteem, we lose the ability to 
extend compassion toward ourselves 
and others. We become trapped in a 
painful cycle of criticism and anxiety. 
The underlying belief that self-worth 
and happiness is conditional upon 
a narrow view of success actually 
threatens our potential for success 
as it inhibits our ability to adapt to 
challenges in the future. It even 
threatens our ability to learn.

Performance anxiety rests on 

the false assumption that the most 
gratifying step toward a goal is 
achieving 
it. 
This 
is 
a 
misunderstanding. 

The final result of our successes is 
not the most meaningful part of our 
journey. Accomplishments have value 
because of the knowledge and skill 
we gain in our effort to achieve them. 
For example, you might not value an 
accomplishment that took little effort 
on your part, but one that took years 
of training and preparation is cause 
for immense celebration. Because 
the value of our hard work is actually 
independent from the final result, 
hard-earned failure can hold the same 
value as hard-earned accomplishment. 
In order to feel good about ourselves, 
we need to appreciate the equal 
value of failure. From this expanded 
viewpoint, we are able to honor our 
shortcomings and bounce back from 
feelings of inadequacy. 

Another 
challenge 
to 
our 

relationship with success and failure is 

our tendency to compare our suffering 
against our peers’ suffering as a metric 
for success. For example, when we 
observe our classmates pulling all-
nighters and living on caffeine, we 
worry that we ourselves are not doing 
enough. 

This mode of thinking is like 

watching a race. As a runner reaches 
the finish, you notice that she had 
been running with a knife in her foot. 
You assume that she won because 
of the knife in her foot rather than 
in spite of it. When it is your turn to 
compete, you proceed to stick a knife 
in your own foot, thinking that this 
will aid your success. Clearly, this is 
an irrational and inefficient mode of 
approaching success. When we use 
comparison of suffering to measure 
success, we cultivate disingenuous 
motivation. This kind of motivation 
is founded in insecurity, anxiety-
driven 
productivity 
and 
self-

resentment. While perpetuating this 
negative feedback loop may lead to 

“success,” it leaves us feeling so dead 
inside that we lose the ability to enjoy 
and appreciate what we are working 
toward in the first place. The more 
fulfilling 
source 
of 
motivation 

is internal — it lives within us in 
the form of hope, passion and 
commitment. We can avoid undue 
suffering by cultivating genuine 
motivation. 

Constantly 
feeling 
exhausted 

and overworked is not a virtue. It 
is an inability to understand the 
source of success. Success is not how 
much suffering you can endure, but 
rather how much suffering you can 
let go of, knowing that passion and 
determination will be there to carry 
you once you let go of fear-driven 
perfectionism. Academic performance 
anxiety can be useful to give us the 
boosts we need in small increments, 
but running on it for years is draining 
and destructive toward our physical 
health, ultimately depriving us of 
happiness. 

Living life from a place of fear 

retracts from our limitless personal 
potential. 
Before 
we 
enter 
the 

professional world, U-M students need 
to dissect whether our fear of failure 
stems from a fear that we are not 
productive and valuable human beings 
at our core. 

Students can move away from this 

fear by developing a greater sense 
of self-compassion. This may seem 
simple, but it is far from a magic trick. 
Mindfulness practices constitute a 
family of research-backed therapeutic 
approaches to tackling low self-esteem 
and anxiety. By practicing powerful 
mindfulness techniques, we can 
create space between ourselves and 
our negative thought loops, enabling 
us to observe and correct damaging 
patterns without judgment. 

Hopefully, we will fail a few times in 

the process.

W

ith over 130 years of 
independent 
student 

journalism, 
The 

Michigan Daily’s mission is to maintain 
“impartiality, fairness and the complete 
truth.” The editorial leadership of 
The Daily holds the concepts of 
journalistic integrity, accountability and 
transparency in the highest regard and 
we — as student journalists, University 
of Michigan students and Ann Arbor 
residents — derive a deep sense of 
gratitude and appreciation for the 
opportunities and responsibilities this 
institution has afforded us. 

That said, in order to maintain 

transparency and hold ourselves 
accountable in pursuing that mission, 
we are notifying our readers that on 
Feb. 28, The Daily’s Managing Editor 
discovered numerous instances of 
plagiarism during the editing process 
in an ultimately unpublished Arts 
column submission. A day later, the 
individual who was found to have 
plagiarized — an Arts writer and The 
Statement contributor — was notified 
of their termination as a Daily staffer. 
As stated in The Daily’s bylaws, “A 
violation of these bylaws and/or the 
ethics code is cause for dismissal. … 
Plagiarism is a fireable offense, but 
should be considered in the context 
of the situation.” Per the bylaws, the 
individual appealed the firing, inviting 
a formal investigation and hearing 
to take place. Over the course of the 

following week, the Managing Editor 
met with a panel of nine editors across 
three sections to review all published 
articles by the individual to check for 
any other instances of plagiarism. 

Unfortunately, in addition to the 

latest unpublished column submission 
by the individual, four other articles 
published 
September 
2020 
to 

December 2020 were found to have 
varying levels of plagiarism. Since the 
individual appealed the firing, The 
Daily’s Management Desk met on 
Sunday, March 14, to review the case. 
Management Desk determined that 
the writer’s plagiarism was intentional, 
that the firing should not be overturned 
and that the individual should not 
be allowed to join another section of 
The Daily. Seventy-six Management 
Desk members were present, and all 
three items were passed with majority 
support. 

Over the past two weeks since the 

initial discovery of plagiarism, we have 
taken steps to combat further instances 
of this unethical and unacceptable 
behavior. The Daily’s Copy Desk, as 
well as the Managing Editor, now use a 
plagiarism database checker; between 
the Copy team and the Managing 
Editor, all published editorial content 
will be scanned for plagiarism moving 
forward. 

It is important to note that The 

Daily’s Arts content was not edited by 
the Copy Desk until January of this 

year and, based on comprehensive 
education of no-tolerance policies 
regarding stealing others’ work put 
in place by both The Daily and the 
University, section editors do not 
anticipate occurrences of plagiarism. 
No matter the intent, plagiarism is 
unacceptable and stands in stark 
contrast with the ethical values and 
goals of The Daily. 

With that in mind, the following 

articles containing plagiarism have 
been permanently removed from 
our website: “‘Raised by Wolves’ is 
a religious sci-fi mashup” — Sept. 7, 
2020; “Without live audiences, Ann 
Arbor comedians search for ways to 
perform” — Sept. 24, 2020; “Good dog 
or bad dog? A condensed almanac of 
canines in history” — Oct. 21, 2020; 
“The Humor Column’s guide to off-
campus housing” — Dec. 3, 2020.

As we remain deeply invested in 

maintaining the transparency and 
integrity of The Daily, we apologize 
on behalf of our institution. As student 
journalists, we sincerely hope that this 
incident can be a learning process for 
all those involved and that we can all be 
better for it. It is our honor and privilege 
to provide our community with daily 
content, and we will continue to do 
so with an upgraded standard of fact-
checking and editorial solidarity.

J

oe Manchin is to progressives 

what Mitch McConnell was 

to liberals. Or is he? Over the 

past few months, Sen. Joe Manchin, 

D-W.Va., has been in the crosshairs 

of many progressives and liberals for 

his staunchly moderate viewpoints. 

Manchin opposes a $15 minimum 

wage, removing the filibuster and other 

progressive policies like Medicare for All. 

He also responded to calls to “defund the 

police” last summer by tactfully tweeting 

“Defund, my butt.” 

Clearly, Manchin has not made many 

friends among Gen-Z or older progressive 

Democrats who strongly support the 

aforementioned policies. This leaves 

many of us to wonder why we need him 

in the Democratic Party and what role he 

serves. West Virginia, Manchin’s home 

state, is one of the most conservative in 

the country, with President Joe Biden 

losing the state by almost 40% in the 

2020 presidential election. 

Manchin was uniquely able to get 

elected due to his deep ties to the state 

and his portrayal as a blue-dog Democrat, 

which means he is socially conservative 

but progressive on issues of labor and 

some governmental regulation. That is 

why West Virginians support Manchin 

who also supported Obamacare despite 

traditional 
conservatives 
strongly 

opposing that policy. All of this is to say 

that Manchin is the best Democrats 

could hope for out of a ruby red state like 

West Virginia.

With the Senate in a virtual 50-50 

deadlock, every vote can make or break 

legislation and Manchin often finds 

himself on the fence of Democratic 

legislation. Some call Manchin the most 

important politician in Washington at the 

moment — the Democratic party must 

adhere to his will. If progressives had their 

way, Manchin would not be a senator; but 

it is important to consider the alternative.

Considering how conservative West 

Virginia is, it is already a miracle that 

Democrats got someone from their 

party elected. If the more progressive 

wing of the Democratic Party continues 

to villainize Manchin, his reelection 

chances could be in danger. While at 

face value, some progressives don’t like 

that he is so powerful and want him 

removed from the Senate, we rarely look 

at the opposite viewpoint. If Manchin’s 

seat were filled with a Republican, the 

Republican Party would control the 

Senate, as they have since 2014.

In an era of immense voter 

suppression and attempted GOP reversal 

of the presidential election, every blue 

vote is essential. It is imperative that 

Democrats maintain control of the 

Senate, yet every day that progressives 

vilify Manchin in the media is a day 

closer to McConnell and the GOP 

flipping another seat to the Republican 

Party. Democrats need to do everything 

they can to keep the seats they have and 

potentially pick up more in 2022. Tearing 

ourselves down from the inside out does 

not help the cause.

This column is in no way a ringing 

endorsement of Manchin’s policies. I 

disagree with him in most of his centrist 

and conservative policies. Still, Manchin 

and I agree on one broad theme: 

advancing the Democratic party instead 

of the GOP. Without Manchin’s vote, 

the $1.9 trillion stimulus deal would not 

have passed the Senate. If Manchin’s 

seat were occupied by a Republican, 

Democrats would have to make immense 

compromises, potentially accepting a 

plan one-third the size of Biden’s. Instead, 

Biden was able to make good on his first 

campaign promise of sending direct help 

to individuals who need it the most. 

The state of American politics and the 

structure of the Senate makes it difficult 

to even get a Democratic majority, much 

less one with a large enough margin for 

progressives to have any power. Manchin 

helps us achieve liberal policies and block 

conservative initiatives, even if it comes 

at the price of more progressive policies. 

It is imperative that we do not let the 

perfect become the enemy of the good.

It is easy to point to and scapegoat 

Manchin as the reason Democrats 

cannot legislate with the stroke of a pen, 

but that takes away from some of the 

systemic problems within the Democratic 

Party and how certain Democrats 

have prioritized the wrong objectives 

throughout the years. In 2020, Democrats 

were outpaced in their ground campaign 

efforts leading to numerous inroads from 

Republicans, which represented a large 

failure from the Democratic National 

Convention. If Democrats focused on 

reforming these problems instead of 

directing their attention toward Manchin, 

they could have a five-seat majority in the 

Senate and Manchin would simply be a 

blip on all of our radars.

Progressive attacks on Manchin are 

not only misplaced, but detrimental to 

the future success of the Democratic 

Party in the Senate. In a state that is right 

leaning, having a Democratic ally is a 

huge advantage and should be celebrated 

as a success rather than a failure. 

I

t 
has 
been 
well-established 

that the Biden administration’s 

foreign policy has not changed 

much from its predecessor’s. In fact, 

I have written about this continuity 

before; however, even in that article, 

I acknowledged one major change 

between the Trump administration’s 

and Biden administration’s foreign 

policy — the alleged end of United 

States support for the Saudi Arabian 

war against the Houthi rebels in 

Yemen. Doing so would unequivocally 

be a step in the right direction. Since 

the war began in 2014, it has caused 

over a million people to be displaced, 

widespread cholera outbreak, massive 

medicine shortages and a nation-wide 

famine. All of this has led the United 

Nations 
International 
Children’s 

Emergency Fund to deem the situation 

in Yemen the worst humanitarian 

crisis in the world. 

Along with supposedly ending 

U.S. support for the war in Yemen, 

the Biden administration ostensibly 

made another big step toward ending 

the U.S.’s long-time policy of turning 

a blind eye to Saudi Arabia’s human 

rights abuses. A few weeks ago, Avril 

Haines, director of national intelligence, 

released a report stating that Saudi 

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 

ordered the 2018 murder of Washington 

Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a 

prominent critic of the Saudi monarchy. 

These moves are consistent with 

President Joe Biden’s 2019 declaration 

that Saudi Arabia is a “pariah state” that 

is “murdering innocent people and (has) 

to be held accountable” and are a natural 

step for an administration that claims to 

center human rights in its foreign policy.

You 
might 
have 
noticed 
by 

now that, in describing the Biden 

administration’s stated shift in policy 

toward Saudi Arabia, I have used a 

number of qualifiers such as “allegedly,” 

“supposedly” and “ostensibly.” This is 

because the Biden administration is not 

actually serious about changing U.S. 

policy toward Saudi Arabia and has no 

intention of making anything beyond 

cosmetic changes.

On ending the war in Yemen, 

Biden’s lack of commitment is evident 

in the words he chose to use in his 

speech announcing this supposed 

move. He stated that, “We are ending 

all American support for offensive 

operations in the war in Yemen, 

including relevant arms sales” and that, 

“we’re going to continue to support 

and help Saudi Arabia defend its 

sovereignty and its territorial integrity 

and its people.” 

It’s already obvious that the Biden 

administration has no intention of 

ending support for the war in Yemen. 

What defines an “offensive operation”? 

Who gets to designate an operation as 

“offensive”? The Saudi Crown Prince, 

Mohammed bin Salman, has indicated 

in speeches that he views Iran as the 

aggressor in Yemen, so by that standard, 

any number of actions in Yemen can be 

seen as defensive. Furthermore, what 

does “help(ing) Saudi Arabia defend its 

sovereignty” mean? 

Again, if you accept the Saudi 

government’s view that the war in 

Yemen is about stopping Iranian 

aggression, 
many 
of 
the 
Saudi 

government’s abuses can be attributed 

to attempts to defend Saudi Arabia’s 

sovereignty. An administration that 

was truly serious about ending support 

for Saudi Arabia’s invasion of Yemen 

would have been far more direct in 

describing how it plans to end support 

for this invasion and would have 

qualified this shift far less than Biden 

did. Biden did not because he has no 

intention of ending support for the 

invasion.

This lack of actual commitment 

is even clearer when it comes to 

holding Saudi Arabia accountable 

for murdering Jamal Khashoggi 

so that, as Biden put it, “Jamal’s 

death will not be in vain.” Here, 

the Biden administration makes it 

clear that it does not intend to even 

give Mohammed bin Salman a slap 

on the wrist for the brutal murder 

of a dissident journalist, fearing 

damage 
to 
American 
relations 

with Saudi Arabia. In particular, 

Biden administration officials cite 

“cooperation on counterterrorism 

and confronting Iran.” This is, 

simply, a joke. Saudi Arabia has, as 

part of the war in Yemen no less, 

allied itself with large terrorist 

organizations such as al-Qaeda — 

groups that the U.S. has committed 

itself to eradicate. 

Even putting all of this aside 

and assuming that the only reason 
Biden wants to maintain good 
relations with Saudi Arabia is for 
access to its oil, it is not a good 
reason to continue to aid and abet 
Saudi Arabia’s abuses. Saudi Arabia 
currently supplies only 6% of the 
U.S.’s petroleum imports and 7% 
of its crude oil imports. Even with 
the assumption that every other 
Persian Gulf country would stop 
supplying oil to the U.S. in solidarity 
with Saudi Arabia — something 
that should not be assumed given 
recent tensions between Saudi 
Arabia and Qatar — the conflict 
would only cost the U.S. 7% of its 
crude oil imports. 

For comparison, during the 1973 

Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries oil embargo, 
OPEC countries imported nearly 
48% of oil imported to the U.S. 
While losing 7% of our crude oil 
imports — roughly 2% of our total 
oil consumption — would have 
some level of impact, it is not a 
reason to continue supporting a 
regime that murders journalists, 
especially when our government 
and 
government-funded 
media 

condemn 
other 
countries 
for 

doing the same. Nor do I see it as a 
reason to continue support for the 
immiseration of Yemen. 

If the Biden administration 

wants to show that it actually 
cares about Saudi Arabia’s crimes, 
it needs to genuinely end support 
for the war in Yemen, not just 
“offensive operations.” It also 
needs to punish those at the 
highest levels of its government 
for murdering journalists. Only 
then should talk of “recalibrating” 
a relationship with Saudi Arabia 
be taken seriously.

T

he 
Beatles 
fantasized 

about “Lucy in the Sky with 
Diamonds,” Eminem rapped 

about 
mushrooms, 
A$AP 
Rocky 

celebrated “L$D.” In an interview with 
Rolling Stone, Harry Styles credits 
magic mushrooms for his creativity 
in producing his chart-topping album 
Fine Line.

Psychedelics play a role in music 

and pop culture, but they are also 
increasingly relevant in scientific 
and psychiatric research. Psilocybin, 
commonly 
known 
as 
magic 

mushrooms, has recently made national 
news because of its possible benefits in 
treatment for certain mental illnesses.

In November, Oregon legalized 

psilocybin, the first ruling anywhere 
across the globe to declare plans for 
regulating the drug’s therapeutic use. 
Ann Arbor has decriminalized magic 
mushrooms and other psychedelic 
plants, along with other cities such as 
Denver, Colo.; Oakland, Calif. and Santa 
Cruz, Calif.

This past January, the Advanced 

Integrative 
Medical 
Science 

Institute 
addressed 
the 
federal 

Drug Enforcement Administration 
requesting that psilocybin be allowed 
in the therapeutic treatment of 
“terminally ill cancer patients suffering 
from anxiety and/or depression.” The 
DEA responded, denying therapeutic 
use due to the current Controlled 
Substances 
Act 
regulations. 
On 

Monday, March 8, Dr. Sunil Aggarwal 
of AIMS filed a petition for review with 

the United States Ninth Circuit Court 
of Appeals for medical treatment of 
cancer patients with mental health 
concerns. 

These updates may initially seem 

shocking, 
as 
psilocybin 
is 
still 

technically a prohibited Schedule 1 
Drug, which is categorized along with 
marijuana as having “no currently 
accepted medical use.” The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration, however, 
recognizes 
Compass 
Pathways’ 

research on psilocybin in that it shows 
potential for substantially improving 
patient outcomes with certain cases 
of depression.

Psilocybin is currently undergoing 

Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for 
treatment-resistant depression, and 
it has been studied as a possible 
treatment 
for 
specific 
terminal 

illness-related 
depression 
and 

anxiety, as well as substance abuse 
disorders. In addition, John Hopkins 
School of Medicine’s research found 
that psilocybin had a significant effect 
on depression and anxiety symptoms 
after five weeks and persisting after 
six months. 

With 
the 
administration 

of psilocybin, one study noted 
significant reductions in smoking 
rates, 
while 
a 
proof-of-concept 

study reported increases in sobriety 
rates for individuals with alcohol 
dependence. Psilocybin has also 
been studied in relation to obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and ongoing 
clinical trials are studying the use of 

the drug in treating post-traumatic 
stress disorder, cocaine and opioid 
use 
disorders, 
anorexia 
nervosa 

and depression in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease. 

Why 
should 
we 
research 

psychedelics in treating psychiatric 
disorders instead of further studying 
antidepressants and other medications 
that are already commonly prescribed? 
Many individuals are more interested 
in psilocybin because the current 
medications on the market have not 
worked well for them. Others like 
the idea of psilocybin because the 
treatment has quick and long-lasting 
effects and lacks various negative side 
effects such as weight changes and 
decreased sex drive that may come with 
antidepressants.

How 
do 
psychedelics 
act 
as 

therapeutic agents from a biological 
standpoint? Its neurophysiology comes 
down to changes in metabolism and 
blood flow in the brain. Such changes 
activate regions of the brain that do not 
usually interact with one another. As a 
result, there is less activity in structures 
called the default mode network, 
which is thought to contribute to the 
therapeutic effects that psychedelics 
can have in treating mental illness.

You may wonder why psilocybin is 

classified as a high-risk, Schedule 1 drug 
if it supposedly can treat psychiatric 
disorders. The stigma surrounding 
psilocybin and other psychedelics 
largely exists due to President Nixon’s 
War on Drugs. During the 1950s, 

however, psychedelics were found to 
have positive effects and usage spread 
to mental health professionals clinically 
and in research. Nixon’s signing of 
the Controlled Substances Act in 
1970 criminalized psychedelics and 
terminated any research in the works 
on the matter. 

If psychedelics such as psilocybin 

are approved to treat psychiatric 
conditions, they will be highly regulated 
by psychiatrists. These drugs would 
not be readily available for just anyone 
to try. However, it is important to note 
that psilocybin has been used in some 
indigenous cultures for millennia and 
still is used for such practices in some 
areas of the United States today.

What about the horror stories of 

bad trips? The concept of “set and 
setting” refers to the combination of 
an individual’s environment during a 
psychedelic session and their mindset 
beforehand. The psychiatrists who 
would be providing the psychedelic-
assisted therapy would be expected 
to evaluate and facilitate a safe set 
and setting to optimize their patients’ 
experiences.

Yes, there are risks associated 

with the usage of psilocybin, as 
there are with any drug. According 
to Neurotherapeutics, a scientific 
journal, the main risk of psilocybin 
and psychedelics is potential anxiety 
and confusion, as these sentiments 
could lead to harmful choices when 
unsupervised. Additionally, individuals 
who have current psychosis, are 

at risk for psychotic disorders or 
are predisposed to cardiovascular 
problems are excluded from psilocybin 
studies due to the increased chance of a 
negative reaction.

I am not, by any means, encouraging 

individuals with mental health concerns 
to experiment with psychedelics on 
their own. But drugs such as psilocybin 
seem to have a lot of potential for 
assisting certain individuals with their 
mental health troubles. Rick Doblin, 
the founder and executive director of 
the Multidisciplinary Association for 
Psychedelic Studies, explains that his 
organization’s long-term goal is “mass 
mental health.”

Doblin has a point. If society wishes 

to achieve “mass mental health,” we 

must approach treatment for mental 
illnesses from all angles. There is no 
“one box fits all” in medicine; every 
patient is going to require a slightly 
different treatment plan, as we all have 
our personal preferences and individual 
differences in drug responses.

So sure, pop culture’s obsession 

with psychedelics may not be solely 
rooted in medicinal purposes. There 
may be a lot of promise in psychedelic-
assisted therapy, though. And maybe, 
one day, there will be orange pill jars 
lining the shelves at CVS Pharmacy 
that read “psilocybin” in printed 
lettering.

T

hroughout this past year, 
we’ve all made our fair share 
of sacrifices. For most of us, 

it’s been the beginnings and ends of 
varying chapters in our lives. For others, 
reality has been brutal, whether because 
of social isolation, unemployment, or, 
in extreme cases, sickness or death. 
Whatever the cost may be, there’s no 
doubt we’ve paid a high price.

This is why, when I turned on 

the television on Sunday night, I was 
surprised to find the Grammy Awards 
being broadcasted. ‘What the heck,’ I 
thought, ‘aren’t there more important 
things going on right now?’ I did some 
research. 

Sure enough, the Golden Globes took 

place two weeks prior to music’s biggest 
night and the Academy Awards are 
slated to happen in late April. Seriously? 
Read the room, Hollywood. I mean 
really — none of this is that important. 
Does anyone really care what Netflix 
movie wins “Best Picture”? If Taylor 
Swift’s folklore wins album of the year? 
Other than the die-hards out there, I 
think not. 

The numbers speak for themselves. 

Only 6.9 million people watched the 
Globes, a 64% decrease from last 
year. The Emmys garnered a mere 6.1 
million, an 11% decrease from 2019. The 
Grammys received 8.8 million viewers, a 

53% decline from last year.

I understand that some people find 

these award shows grounding during a 
pandemic. Despite the abnormality in 
format, there is normality in practice. 
Yet, the challenge of doing these 
ceremonies on Zoom is ten times more 
monumental. When “Judas and the 
Black Messiah’s” Daniel Kaluuya went 
to accept his award for Best Supporting 
Actor, he was muted. “Ted Lasso’s” 
Jason Sudeikis thought “Zoom casual” 
was appropriate attire for the event. I 
understand these awards shows can 
be a rare glimpse into celebrities’ lives, 
but at a certain point, it feels like the 
motivation is foolish. Perhaps I dare say 
… forced? Where’s the peace in that?

Alas, the ego-fueled industry that 

is entertainment will say all the right 
things but, when push comes to shove, 
they won’t give up their recognition. It’s 
a shame, really, for those who believed 
these luminaries could lead by example. 
They can’t even stay away from each 
other when they’re supposed to!

Last spring, all we heard from our 

beloved entertainers was to mask up, 
social distance and wash our hands. Our 
revered Tom Hanks was the first one to 
contract the virus! Then summer came, 
movie and TV show productions began 
upholding public health guidelines and 
somehow these imperative messages 

got lost in translation. It rings hollow, 
a double-standard symbolized by gold 
trophies. 

I admit: Netflix and music eased 

quarantine life for me, as I’m sure it did 
for many of you, too. We tweeted about 
the absurdity of Carol Baskin and the 
relentlessness of Michael Jordan, while 
The Weeknd gave us an outstanding 
collection of songs to replay. This 
moment in pop culture undoubtedly 
warrants some type of reflection. But if 
we really wanted to reward Hollywood 
for their efforts, we would just make 
these celebrations bigger and better in 
2022. Heck, make it 24-hour coverage 
for all I care. 

Then again, we don’t immerse 

ourselves in entertainment to critique 
it, we do so to be — oddly enough 
— entertained; award shows don’t 
heighten our experience. In this current 
pandemic world we live in, award shows 
lessen it, potentially along with the 
respect we have for the integrity of the 
industry. Right now, our focus should 
be on pushing vaccines out to as many 
people as possible.

The award for “most crucial” goes to ...

A 

lot of my freshman year 
Welcome Week is now 
something of a blur in my 

memory because of my constant, ut-
ter confusion around where I was go-
ing and what I was doing. But there’s 
one thing I remember clearly.

I was pregaming in a room in my 

hall with several other freshman 
girls, whom I’d met and was friendly 
with but didn’t really know. Between 
shots of the vodka my hostess’s par-
ents bought her before they left, I 
mentioned to her how nervous I was 
to ask my professor if it was all right 
for me to miss lecture so I could be at 
services for Rosh Hashanah. A look of 
surprise crossed her face — she hadn’t 
realized I was Jewish. 

“Listen, we won’t have any prob-

lems as long as you’re not another 
jappy f--king b--ch. This school has 
too many of those already.”

I laughed weakly, trying to hide my 

internal panic behind a sip of sickly-
sweet pink lemonade chaser. My 
hostess poured herself another shot 
as if nothing had happened. I made 
my excuses to leave as soon as I felt I 
could safely do so without her real-
izing I’d been insulted and called my 
mother, crying.

Welcome to the University of 

Michigan. Don’t be so outwardly Jew-
ish. That’s b--chy.

I’d never actually met an antisem-

ite before. Sure, I knew antisemitism 
was a thing, but only conceptually. I’d 
grown up in a suburb that had a large 
Jewish population. Until that mo-
ment, I had taken wholly for granted 
the strength of my Jewish community 
at home, both inside and outside of 
my family’s temple.

Honestly, I had expected the Uni-

versity to be more of the same. The 
University has long had a reputation 
for its strong and welcoming Jew-
ish community, so much so that Hil-
lel, the foundation for Jewish campus 
life, ranks the University as a top-five 
Jewish school in the country. Lots of 
kids from my area — from my temple, 
even — end up at the University. To 
my mind, I had no reason to believe 
my experience as a Jewish person 
on campus would be all that different 
from what it had been at home.

But maybe, starting college in the 

middle of the Trump era, I should 
have known better. Hate crimes, after 
all, including antisemitic hate crimes, 
have been on the rise since the now-
former president won the Republi-
can nomination. Though he himself 
rarely expressed hatred for Jewish 
people explicitly, in the wake of his 
success, his supporters no longer felt 
the need to self-censor their own big-
otry, antisemitic or otherwise. I spoke 
about this phenomenon over Zoom 
with Jamie Moshin, a lecturer in the 
Department of Communication & 
Media who specializes in rhetoric and 
American Jewish identity. 

“In so many ways, I think Trump 

calls in this audience that ends up be-
ing like the Proud Boys and the Char-
lottesville marchers who are looking 
for someone to speak their language, 
and he spoke their language,” Moshin 
said. “He didn’t speak about it as loud-
ly as they did, but I think he gave them 
the courage to speak loudly.” 

Looking back over the exhausting 

events of the last five years through 
that lens, it’s easy to pick out the hate-
ful pattern Moshin’s talking about. It’s 
there in the shooting at Tree of Life 
synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pa., in the 
plot to bomb a Colorado synagogue, in 
the desecration of a Jewish cemetery 
in Grand Rapids, Mich. In our own 
community in Ann Arbor, it’s also 
there during Saturday protests out-
side local synagogues during Shabbat 
morning services.

But I can also pick it out of my 

personal life with fairly little effort. 
Though thankfully they’re not nearly 
as explicit, the threads of discrimina-
tion are still there. The threads were 
there during an instance in my soror-
ity rush process. I remember walking 
happily out of what would become my 
sorority for the first time, and hearing 
the girl in line behind me mutter, “Ew, 
I hated them. They were so… Jewish.”

Yes, my sorority is historically Jew-

ish, and yes, most of our members 
on campus are Jewish. But I’d never 
heard Jewishness sound like a slur, 
never heard it sound as derogatory as 
it did when it was coming out of her 

mouth on that sunny, nerve-wrack-
ing September afternoon. To me, the 
word had always been neutral: Either 
someone was Jewish or wasn’t. Out 
of her mouth, it wasn’t an adjective. It 
was an insult. 

The threads were there when I 

proudly wore my new AEPhi shirt on 
campus the day after receiving my bid, 
which is the same day that my Wel-
come Week hostess stopped speaking 
to me. Before, we’d exchanged awk-
ward hellos in the halls. Now all of a 
sudden, it was like I didn’t exist. One 
thing had changed: I was in AEPhi. I 
had branded myself, in her eyes, as a 
“jappy f--king b--ch.”

It was not a major loss — anyone 

who doesn’t respect my religion or my 
right to be at the institution I worked 
so hard to get into has no place in my 
life. Still, it was something: just that 
little thread of prejudice, running 
through my college experience.

I’m not the only one to feel like 

that. I spoke to LSA sophomore Yonit 
Robin, Michigan Hillel’s finance chair 
and Delta Phi Epsilon member, which 
is also a historically Jewish sorority, 
about her experience in Jewish cam-
pus life. She, too, had been branded as 
a “
JAP” before. 
Though the term was originally a 

derogatory slur against Japanese peo-
ple during World War II, it eventually 
came to have an additional meaning, 
which is unrelated but common: the 
Jewish American Princess. The JAP 
is essentially a rude caricature of a nor-
mal young Jewish woman, who, be-
cause of her religion and hobbies, is au-
tomatically deemed spoiled and bratty. 
Generalizations around shopping, bat 
mitzvahs, sororities and summer camp 
abound; so does snark around alleged 
sexual promiscuity. An Urban Diction-
ary definition of a JAP reads, “this girl 
dresses only in clothing that costs more 
than it’s worth (ex. Abercrombie, uggs, 
etc.) and is always getting what they 
want. The Jap is constantly shopping 
and buying this overpriced clothing, 
along with a ridiculous amount of jew-
elry and expensive, needless crap. The 
Jap is known for her very annoying, 
nagging voice.”

“I think that there’s an assumption 

that, because you’re in a Jewish soror-
ity, you automatically fall under that 
category,” Robin said. “There’s kind of 
a stereotype that kind of comes along 
with that, which I wasn’t really aware 
of before I joined, but there’s definite-
ly a stereotype that comes up a lot of 
the time.” 

It’s sort of a Catch-22: Jews histori-

cally weren’t welcome in traditional 
Fraternity & Sorority Life (FSL), so 
they formed their own organizations. 
Even now that they’re at least nomi-
nally welcomed into the houses that 
once shunned them, many Jewish 
students feel more comfortable in his-

torically Jewish organizations like so-
rorities AEPhi, DPhiE and Sigma Del-
ta Tau and fraternities such as Alpha 
Epsilon Pi or Zeta Beta Tau, which 
remain mostly Jewish. These houses 
also often provide Jewish program-
ming such as Shabbat dinners, though 
they do now accept non-Jews. And so 
students in these houses, for choosing 
organizations where they feel most at 
home, are often judged for their per-
ceived lack of effort at fitting in as well 
as criticized for their reluctance to as-
similate and explore outside the bub-
ble of sororities and summer camps — 
even though they’ve been historically 
unwelcome outside of it.

The double standards surrounding 

Jewish FSL don’t stop there though, 
as Deborah Dash Moore, Univer-
sity professor of History and Judaic 
Studies, explained to me over Zoom. 
When largely Christian or non-reli-
gious fraternities have lavish formals 
in Chicago or Canada, they’re college 
kids having fun. When predominant-
ly Jewish houses have similar events, 
they’re flaunting their money, an ac-
cusation that plays on other harm-
ful stereotypes of Jewish people as 
greedy and self-serving. When largely 
Christian or non-religious soror-
ity girls wear expensive, fashionable 
clothing, they’re cool and trendy, but 
when Jewish sorority girls do the 
same, they’re JAPs “spending daddy’s 
money.” 

These stereotypes extend beyond 

Jewish students in FSL, but it’s in this 
social sphere that we often see them 
more clearly, Moore explained.

“It’s not just Jewish behavior, it’s the 

intersection of Jewish ethnicity with 
class standing with age of the students 
and what is considered to be appropri-
ate or okay for 18, 19, 20-year-old men 
to do, and conversely for the same age 
women to do,” Moore said. “There’s a 
double standard, especially if they’re 
(Christian FSL students) white. It’s not 
just their class standing and their be-
havior, but that they’re white: They’re 
part of the dominant group. 

Moore further commented on 

the role of these stereotypes, saying 
they’re a way to still label Jewish stu-

dents as outsiders.“What these Jew-
ish stereotypes tend to do is to signal 
that Jews are not part of the dominant 
group,” Moore said. “They’re ways to 
put down Jews in their aspirations 
to join this upper class standing with 
which comes the license to misbe-
have. Jews don’t have a license to mis-
behave.”

The JAP stereotype is also interest-

ing because it actually originates from 
Jewish men in the mid-20th century 
complaining about how much more 
demanding it was to date Jewish 
girls. The reason these women were 
allegedly higher-maintenance was 
because of American consumer cul-

ture. For women especially, visible 
consumption such as fancy clothes 
and nice cars were (and indeed, still 
are) status symbols. Jews at the time, 
still not quite assimilated into the 
mainstream in the U.S., wanted to be 
seen in that ideal American light. So 
they turned to visible consumerism as 
their avenue, thus gaining themselves 
a reputation as spoiled. 

It’s no accident that this insult was 

directed specifically towards Jewish 
women: The JAP stereotype is also 
rooted in misogyny. Initially, this was 
borne out of resentment from Jew-
ish men. But soon, the JAP stereo-
type was co-opted into the common 
vernacular, and there it grew from 
semi-joking insult into a full-on de-
rogatory term. While the term was 
hurtful coming from Jewish people, 
it is unequivocally offensive coming 
from non-Jews.
E

ven more concerningly, in 
the common vernacular, the 
JAP stereotype plays into the 

centuries-old antisemitic myth that 
Jews are controlling all of the world’s 
banks and money for their own profit. 
These stereotypes have been used 
to violently harm and discriminate 
against Jewish people for centuries. 

“(The JAP) is an antisemitic stereo-

type, there is no question,” Moore said. 
“That then gets spread to the larger 
society and picked up by non-Jews as 
well … That’s a real problem. It’s a ste-
reotype. Wealthy, young Jewish wom-
en who spend money, that doesn’t 
mean that they’re JAPs. It means that 
they’re wealthy, young Jewish women 
who spend conspicuously.” 

Still, though, these harmful stereo-

types persist in everyday language. 
Sometimes it’s out of ignorance. 
Sometimes it’s out of genuine hatred. 
Sometimes it’s somewhere in be-
tween. But the threads of antisemi-
tism persist. Perhaps it should be less 
surprising that these stereotypes have 
taken on so strongly in the state of 
Michigan, which has a storied history 
of racism and antisemitism from Hen-
ry Ford to Father Charles Coughlin to 
the KKK. And on top of that come 
the issues around out-of-state admis-

sions, which play into long-standing 
contempt for wealthy Jewish people 
from urban areas. This contempt is 
not unique to Michigan by any means; 
the Anti-Defamation League reports 
that similar prejudices are wide-
spread across the country, and not 
limited to the non-wealthy. 

The state of Michigan has been de-

creasing public education funding for 
decades, so the University has turned 
to out-of-state students, who pay 
nearly double the in-state tuition, to 
keep its finances stable. This has been 
criticized by those who argue that the 
out-of-staters can pay their way into 
the spots that should be going to in-
state students. 

And since a significant propor-

tion of Jewish students are from out-
of-state and are often fairly wealthy, 
these pre-existing tensions then inter-
sect in ugly ways with the perception 
of Jews as rich, greedy and self-serv-
ing to breed contempt in many against 
the University’s Jewish population. 
None of this is to say that in-state 
students are less wealthy and/or less 
tolerant; but instead to point out how 
this important debate plays into long-
standing antisemitic tropes. 

“That type of resentment is partly a 

class resentment,” Moore said. “Work-
ing-class and middle-class Michigan 
natives do lose seats to students who 
come from, say, the coasts, and many 
of these students are Jewish, they pay 
a lot more money … I’ve had in-state 
students who say to me, ‘This was the 
first time I ever met a Jew.’ And they 
only know what they’ve read, what 
they’ve heard, what’s in the air.”

The stereotype just becomes the 

most logical answer to these ques-
tions in a larger society with baked-in 
antisemitism, Moshin said. 

“If you’re someone who has not had 

a lot of experience with Jewish people, 
there are so many narratives about 
Jews and money,” Moshin said. “That 
is such a common narrative that gets 
told over and over and over again, and 
so it’s part of our cultural knowledge of 
what it means to be Jewish. So when 
people go on very limited knowledge 
and very limited experience with ac-
tual Jewish people, and what they have 
is this story, then I think you read into 
that elitism, you read into that Jewish-
ness, and it just becomes part of the 
cognitive schema. We’ve built up these 
cultural narratives that we immediate-
ly tap into, especially if we don’t have a 
particularly deep knowledge of it. So it 
just becomes the easy explanation for 
everything.”

The results of this prejudice can be 

easy to miss if you’re not looking out 
for it. The insults and stereotypes are 
hidden deeper in the subtext of many 
conversations. 

Both Rabbi Fully Eisenberger, di-

rector of the Jewish Resource Cen-
ter on campus, and Tilly Shemer, the 
executive director of University Hil-
lel, discussed with me their efforts to 
counter this prejudice and make their 
organizations havens for Jewish stu-
dents on campus. They’ve expressed 
how they’ve had to try to help stu-
dents who have felt attacked for their 
faith on campus.

“That line of when something 

crosses over into antisemitism can 
differ for different students,” Shemer 
said. “Whether people realize it or 
not, there’s hateful and offensive lan-
guage that can be used towards Jew-
ish students that can feel more pain-
ful to them as a minority group, and 
it’s important for Jewish students 
to be able to have the space to share 
with their campus community when 
they feel targeted and when they feel 
offended.

What COVID-19’s done to the campus club

BY GRACE TUCKER, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

I

t was the fall of 2019, a week or so into 
my first semester as a University of 
Michigan student, and I was launching 

myself headfirst into new experiences with 
a crazed level of zeal. Over the course of one 
week, I downloaded Tinder for the first time, 
then swiftly tried my hand at blocking some-
one from Tinder, vinyasa-ed my way through 
my first group yoga class, went to my first real 
party, the list goes on. I was buzzed on the 
kind of gluttonous ambition one can only clas-
sify as freshman fall hysteria. 

The next step, it seemed, was to find the 

student organization that would become my 
home. 

The dream scenario looked like this: it’s 

Festifall, the University’s take on the quint-
essential “club fair,” and I’m one of the thou-
sands of freshmen anonymously moving in a 
stupid pack, a school of fish. Then, in slow-
motion, a self-assured upperclassman plucks 
me gracefully from the crowd, guiding me 
safely to their respective club table, to which-
ever little community they had formed on 
campus. And a new group of friends would 
descend upon me, angels with wings.

But reality failed to replicate this dream. 

On that fateful Friday, situated at the tail end 
of orientation activities, Ingalls Mall had been 
invaded by a mass of student leaders occu-
pying little, rectangular factions of grass and 
darting around with manic enthusiasm. In-
tensely ornamented poster boards and color-
coded interest forms were in plentiful supply. 

And swarming past in congested packs 

were their unassuming attendees, the fresh-
men. Some were in pairs, beckoning their best 
friend of 24 hours to come to check out the 
perfect film society they “gotta join.” Some, 
like me, made the risky decision of attending 
the event alone, collecting a forest’s worth of 
mass-meeting informational slips. Cooking 
clubs, publications, acting troupes, fraterni-
ties, improv groups — I wanted to sample it 
all.

And sample I did. RC Players, the Univer-

sity’s chapter of College Democrats, Camp 
Kesem, Dance Marathon, Women’s Glee Club 
and Her Campus magazine were just a few 
of the clubs I scouted. But, ironically enough, 
after weeks of mass meetings and enough 
GroupMe invites and listservs to make my 
laptop crash, I hadn’t yet found either of the 
two organizations I would later devote myself 
to at this school (one being this paper and the 
other being a co-ed a cappella group on cam-
pus). 

Essentially, a great majority of my fresh-

man year can be summed up by this thrill-
ing and exhausting chase to belong. Explor-
ing these groups, then finding people I really 
clicked with and looked forward to seeing in 
these groups, was a cornerstone of my fresh-
man experience. 

My first few meetings as a Daily Arts writer 

were icebreakers and trivial announcements 
but also stacks of newspapers, walls plastered 
corner-to-corner with campaign posters, a 
finely-tuned newsroom of worker bees. And 
on the left side of the room, the arts writers 
would congregate, each carrying their own 
notebook of scribbled story pitches and inter-
view quotes; a cast of characters talking about 
new films or new music or a really dope new 
Korean restaurant on State Street. My mere 
proximity to these kinds of people made me 
want to write forever and then some. 

And my a cappella rehearsals were about 

sight-singing and vocal blend but were also 
about the way group members would file 
into a depressing, Barney-purple Modern 
Languages Building auditorium on a Mon-
day night and find something to celebrate — a 
new job offer for Mark or Miriam’s fresh new 
manicure or something hilarious and perfect-
ly delivered by Josh. We’d shake off the flush 
from the Michigan winter outside and find 
pockets of warmth in comfortable conversa-
tion and tight hugs. 

Little did we know that in just a couple of 

weeks, those jumbled rehearsal arrivals and 
flushed exchanges would be terminated by a 
little virus that has an affinity for those who 
speak (or better yet: sing) in close proximity 
to one another.

A year has passed and, after conducting a 

handful of outdoor rehearsals in the Thayer 
Street parking structure, our vocal warmups 
muffled under the fabric of our respective 
facemasks, we’ve transitioned to Zoom. These 

rehearsals tend to be characterized by a loud 
level of silence and a track that lags more than 
it actually plays our vocal parts for us. The 
booming “Za-Za-Za” exercises I used to belt 
with a full chest in a University auditorium 
are now whispered in my sad attempt to not 
disturb my roommates. 

Our group is joined by over 1,600 other 

registered student-run clubs on campus, 
meaning that there are thousands of Zoom 
club meetings just like ours taking place 
for every week that we remain under Uni-
versity-mandated virtual guidelines. While 
freshmen have reflected on the ways cur-
rent circumstances have tarnished what 
was supposed to be an unforgettable year for 
them, I wanted to talk with the upperclass-
men leaders behind these organizations to 

learn more about how other organizations 
are faring. How were they attempting to 
foster community during these unarguably 
bleak times?

LSA senior Tiffany Harris was studying 

abroad in South Africa when the world’s fa-
vorite virus found its way to campus and the 
University effectively moved to a virtual for-
mat. At the time, she was the treasurer and 
devoted member of Creatives of Color, an or-
ganization that fosters collaboration and pro-
fessional development opportunities among 
student artists of color. 

But upon returning home, she got an excit-

ing request from the club’s e-board.

“After … everything had kind of shut down 

they were like, ‘Tiffany, we want you to be the 
president (of the club),” Harris recounted in 
a virtual interview with The Daily. “You’ve 
been the most present and you’ve been there 
since the beginning, so you know so much 
more than a lot of other people.’” The club 
had just been gearing up to host their annual 
showcase, which sought to anonymously pair 
up artists of color — dancers, artists and pho-
tographers alike — to organize collaborative 
acts for their biggest event of the year. They 
held the informational meeting for the show 
just a month prior to the U-M shutdown in 
mid-March. 

Harris tells me CoC was forced to cancel 

all of their events and workshops for the re-
mainder of the year, including the showcase. 
But once a hybrid fall semester rolled around, 
Harris hit the ground running with a presi-
dential enthusiasm:
“

I decided, as president, that I re-
ally wanted to have some in-person, 
safe events,” Harris said. “So, in the 

fall, we had this event called the ‘Creative 
Expo.’ So we had singers, filmmakers, 
dancers, rappers, and some people who 
were on the e-board as well … we trans-
formed our e-board member’s basement 
into an event space. We edited the lights, 
(we) had just, you know, very good cam-
eramen … we had masks on, we tried to 
stay socially distanced when we weren’t 
performing.”

While the event was admittedly very 

“DIY,” Harris tells me, “... we made it work, 
and we performed it via Twitch so it could 
be livestreamed. So instead of having an au-
dience like we usually would, we had about 
30 (virtual) attendees, which I think is pretty 
good for a virtual event.”

Harris has been working feverishly to con-

tinue hosting virtual events, workshops and 
meetings via Zoom in order to maintain a 
similar level of activity that the group might 
experience during a normal school year. 

However, Harris admits that enthusiasm 

among members has been lacking simply be-
cause, “it’s obviously very hard to be creative 
(right now), especially (because) not many 
people want to get on another Zoom call after 
being in Zoom classes all day, which I under-

stand.”

Nevertheless, Harris’s persistent efforts 

within CoC serve as a testament to the ways 
student leaders are creatively adapting to ab-
normal circumstances. 

While she may have never anticipated or-

ganizing a livestream event in her friend’s 
basement to be one of her presidential re-
sponsibilities, this year has shown us that we 
can, in fact, conquer new feats with just a little 
creativity and a lot of flexibility. 

Ultimately, “There’s a lack of friendship 

that we truly need,” Harris admitted. “Our 
community misses it, our e-board misses it … 
we want to do more, but we’re doing the best 
we can.”

Public Health senior Liadan Solomon, ex-

ecutive director of Wolverine Support Net-
work, the premier peer-led support program 
on campus, says her position is “not a low-
commitment role.” She can spend upwards 
of 20+ hours a week working on her WSN ex-
ecutive duties alone, and she wouldn’t have it 
any other way.

“You don’t sign up to do basically a part-

time job for free if you don’t care about it a 
lot,” Solomon said in a virtual interview with 
The Daily. 

Before she became executive director, Sol-

omon was a member of WSN her freshman 
year, then became a group leader, then the 
director of operations. She found out a mere 
few weeks before the campus-wide shut-
down, at the end of February of last year, that 
she would assume the head director position 
she carries now. 

Solomon acknowledges that the rapid 

change and elevated levels of anxiety that 
came with the pandemic go against all that 
WSN stands for: student mental wellness. 
And so, her task became trying to assume 
business as usual, as quickly as possible, with-
in the organization. 

“That transition (to virtual meetings) was 

scary and threatening in some ways. It threat-
ened … the communities that people had al-
ready formed, which is really scary, obvious-
ly,” Solomon said in regards to the close-knit 

support groups WSN’s e-board had meticu-
lously organized in spaces across campus.

But Solomon describes the transition to 

virtual meetings as nearly simultaneous with 
the COVID-19 shutdown. 

“So we transitioned almost immediately 

to virtual… And for us, cancelling our groups 
was never really an option,” Solomon said. 
“We know that a lot of students rely on our 
groups for support and, especially during a 
time when there was so much rapid change 
happening, we knew that the support they 
were getting was so important, so that’s why 
we decided to transition straight to virtual.”

Now, Solomon and the rest of the WSN e-

board are utilizing virtual events and social 
media advocacy to continue the culture of in-
clusivity the network is known for.

“In terms of operation, we’ve not used 

(the) virtual (format) as an excuse to bow 
down from a challenge if that makes sense,” 
Solomon said. “We hosted about 10 events 
over the summer that were all virtual. This 
semester alone, we’re hosting about 16 or 17 
events that are all virtual.”

Solomon even mentioned taking over for 

select group leaders who were not mentally 
able to assume their roles this semester — 
she’s doing the jobs of multiple people and 
executive-directing the entire network and 
she’s doing all of it with zero compensation. 
It is students like Solomon who demonstrate 
that, where the U-M administration has prov-
en inept in terms of protecting the rights and 
wellbeing of their undergraduate and gradu-
ate student bodies, students can show up and 
provide that support for one another.

Pre-law fraternity Kappa Alpha Pi was in 

good company last March as one of countless 
social organizations facing the cancellation of 
one of their semester-defining parties due to 
the onset of COVID-19. (The Michigan A Cap-
pella Council was supposed to host our “Aca-
Prom” the very weekend that students were 
evicted from campus housing). 

KAPi had just finished an in-person, Win-

ter 2020 rush process when plans for their 
formal in Detroit were underway. Public 
Policy junior William Brown, who now holds 
the position of vice president of the fraternity, 
was social chair at the time and remembers 
that fateful week of cancellations and hurried 
transitions.

“From the e-board perspective it was pret-

ty hectic,” Brown told The Daily in a virtual 
interview. “… We kind of had to go into high-
gear and cancel (the formal) and try and get 
refunds … We (then) shut down everything 
and moved everything online, including our 
entire new member orientation system.” 

When asked about how they navigated a 

virtual rush process this semester, KAPi Ex-
ecutive Coordinator Ruby Yearling, an LSA 
junior, said that while the organization didn’t 
see too much of a drop in numbers, the pro-
cess was simply not the same “on an interper-
sonal level.”

“I’m sure that there are a lot of people who 

just aren’t comfortable on Zoom, or there are 
lots of barriers with that,” Yearling specu-
lated. “And so, it’s very possible that there 
were a ton of amazing applicants who we just 
weren’t able to get to know because of the cir-
cumstances.”

Pre-professional organizations like KAPi run 

like a well-operated machine, with each e-board 
member managing their own specific project 
or sector of the club — Yearling, for example, is 
tasked with organizing the club’s “Speaker Se-
ries,” a weekly event that exposes members to 
working professionals within or close to the law 
profession. And, ultimately, not even a global 
pandemic has proven to drastically disrupt this 
perfectly-running operation, partly due to the 
nature of the org and also to the credit of student 
leaders like Yearling and Brown. 

***
A part of me felt reassured to know that, 

similar to my intensely awkward and poorly 
executed Zoom a cappella rehearsals, other 
student orgs were also stumbling through a 
(dare I say it) unprecedented school year. 

When Ingalls Mall will once again be 

flooded with organizations’ coveted Festifall 
propaganda and schools of bright-eyed fresh-
men, I do not know. But nevertheless, student 
leaders continue to serve their communities 
in the best ways they can, come rain or shine, 
hybrid or virtual, Zoom or no Zoom.

M

y series of thoughts on sea-
sons: If summer is a glass of 
cold lemonade, and winter’s a 

crossword at candle-light, then fall is a 
call from a very old friend, and spring is 
a coffee at sunrise.

Summer is for enjoyment, fall is for 

ambition and winter is for persever-
ance. Spring is for rebirth. I’ve always 
felt that the first signs of spring marked 
the new year. I don’t care about what the 
calendars in my life say — New Year’s on 
the first of January, Rosh Hashanah on 
the first of Tishrei. Sure, they’re nice 
celebrations, but I’ve never found them 
to capture the air of change that reintro-
duces itself each spring.

Spring is refreshing. It cleans the 

year’s slate. It breathes in crisp air and 
excitement. In spring, we reemerge 
from the spaces we’ve holed up in for 
months, taking refuge from the winter 
chill. The warmth thaws our sidewalks 
and porches and parks, revealing a sea-
son of leisure and camaraderie. It’s like 
stepping out of the shade into a patch of 
sunlight — suddenly, the world seems 
just a bit brighter.

Spring is inherently hopeful. Seasonal 

depression wanes as snow banks recede. 
Dewy grass marks each morning with 
new opportunities for rejuvenation and 
growth. You can hear birds chirping in 
the trees, inviting the rest of us to join 
them in their celebration.

Over these past few weeks, I’ve taken 

to walking around campus. I’ve found 
that I’m not the only one. On a warm-
er day, students are out in their yards, 
spending time with their roommates. 
Plus, the downtown area is almost back 
to its former glory: packed sidewalks, 
busy storefronts and cheery residents. 
It’s amazing that all it takes to repop-
ulate the streets of Ann Arbor is a day 
where the thermometer breaks 50 de-
grees.

One spring is stolen, the next is re-

claimed. The contents may differ, but 
the framework remains. A cycle contin-

ues beyond our control, but our goal is 
to keep things from staying the same.

One unique aspect of this spring in 

particular is that it’s long overdue. It 
follows a year of suffering — over half 
a million U.S. COVID-19 fatalities and 
counting. One year ago, our spring was 
ripped from the palm of our hands. 
Without much information about the 
unfamiliar threat spreading globally, 
all we could do was nervously wait for 
further guidance. And we were forced 
to sacrifice the hallmark of spring: a 
peaceful return outdoors.

Anniversaries affect us biologically, 

even if we don’t realize it at the mo-
ment. Thinking back to this time last 
year, my memories are all tinged with 
fear. I’m naturally a pretty nervous per-
son, but even my most easy-going peers 
had little to say in the vein of comfort. 
That kind of societal trauma is bound to 
have lasting effects.

Still, the warm weather offered a 

slight padding to the weight of the on-
coming catastrophe. Our social circles 
were constricted, but I was one of the 
fortunate few who still had access to 
the various natural comforts of subur-
ban living and spend time outdoors by 
myself or with friends. Even a short stay 
in nature has been clinically shown to 
improve mental health. For at least the 
first portion of the pandemic, many 
were able to use our environment to our 
advantage.

Once winter hit, though, our environ-

ment turned on us. Forced indoors by the 
harsh Michigan winter, the pandemic felt 
even more insurmountable. Just a month 
ago, the country faced one of the worst 
winter storms in recent history. And 
for those experiencing homelessness 
to whom winter already represented a 
threat to health and safety, the social dis-
tancing complications of the pandemic 
were an added stress on the underfund-
ed shelter system. But amidst mounting 
cynicism that the winter would ever sub-
side, the spring returned once again.

The seasons ebb and flow with no re-

gard for societal happenings. Sometimes 
that means we face devastating disas-
ters, but other times it means that we’re 
met with a much-needed sunny day. The 
weather is just a backdrop for our lives, 
and it’s our responsibility to do what we 
can. This spring, we’re taking the nec-
essary precautions to remain safe while 
making up for lost time.

Jovial children stumble through the 

playground to the field. They greet a 
patch of dandelions, intentions still con-
cealed. Eventually, their daily pilgrim-
age presents a prize. The flowers, once 
a promise, now float wishes through the 
skies.

Despite all my talk of using spring to 

forge a new and different path for the fu-
ture, I often revel in the nostalgia of cer-
tain springtime traditions. Every time I 
step in a fresh patch of mud, I’m trans-
ported back to elementary recess in ear-
ly March. As soon as the bell would ring, 
my friends and I sprinted past the four 
square courts and monkey bars, back to 
the corner of the field where a patch of 
dandelions grew each year.

I thought they were beautiful, a 

bright yellow confirmation that spring 
had sprung. My friends and I picked 
the petals off one-by-one, musing about 
whatever it is that occupies elementa-
ry-age kids’ dreams. We crafted flower 
crowns — before they were trendy — 
and donned our new regalities until the 
teacher inevitably told us to throw them 
out.

But the greatest gift of the dandelions 

came when they shed their yellow pet-
als for a puffy exterior, filled with what 
my friends and I assumed must be magi-
cal properties. We would rush out to the 
patch and spend the hour blowing the 
dandelion seeds into the wind. They say 
that if you could get all the seeds in a 
single breath, you’d earn a wish.

I didn’t know until years later that all 

we were really doing was planting new 
dandelion seeds for the coming season. 

I felt bad when I first found out, because 
this is also when I learned that most 
people (and by that I mean all botanists 
and gardeners) considered dandelions 
a weed. But I still don’t believe it. To 
me, dandelions are never a nuisance. 
They represent a perpetual promise of 
past, present and future springtimes all 
bound together by fleeting wishes from 
a group of little girls.
S

pring enters slowly, taking her 
time. She whispers, then mum-
bles, then belts sublime. She’s got 

my trust and earned my praise. So thank 
you, spring, forever and always.

All of this is to say I absolutely love 

the spring. And I love this spring in par-
ticular. It’s been a real saving grace as 
we hopefully near the end of an endless 
year. In the sun, I feel like a kid again, 
savoring the peace and joy that a simple 
jaunt in nature can provide.

Spring can’t solve all the world’s 

problems, especially with the laundry 
list we’ve accrued since this time last 
year. It can, however, release some of 
the tension that’s built after months of 
insular anticipation. That is spring’s 
purpose, and its gift.

I sometimes wish I didn’t live in 

Michigan, particularly in the winter. 
But without that frame of reference (or, 
logistically, that climate), I couldn’t 
truly appreciate the wonders of spring-
time. I use this season as a time of re-
flection, so hypothetically, I wouldn’t 
be who I am today without the guid-
ance of spring.

This is my love letter to springtime. 

I thank you for your hospitality, your 
enlightenment and your dandelions. 
Thank you for the year’s first late-night 
bonfires; for Daylight Saving Time and 
the extra hour of life it offers; for gazpa-
cho and for iced tea; for my birthday, my 
graduations, both past and future, and 
all the amazing experiences I can’t yet 
name.

I love you, spring. I hope you come to 

love me all the same.

A love 
letter to the 
burgeoning 
spring

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


Nine days and two games isn’t 

much time for Juwan Howard to 

have it figured out, but it’ll have to be 

enough.

The last time 

Isaiah 
Livers 

got hurt, the 

Michigan men’s 

basketball team 

failed that test. 

It’s easy to for-

get now — that 

2019-20 
team 

wasn’t as good 

as this team, 

that season’s end overshadows every-

thing in a way this season’s won’t. 

Howard, of course, remembers. 

“We had some experience in this 

last season when Isaiah went down,” 

he said on a Zoom call Sunday. “I 

can’t recall how many games he 

missed last season. I just feel bad for 

Isaiah.”

To refresh his memory, Livers 

missed 10 games. Michigan went 5-5 

in those games, not to mention a loss 

against Illinois after Livers left the 

game with an injury. The Wolverines 

went from a pretty good team to one 

that was losing four straight home 

games. 

But that was a team whose ceil-

ing was nowhere near this one’s. 

This team can win a national title. It 

might even be able to win a national 

title without Livers, its best 3-point 

shooter and second-leading scorer. 

That, at least, is still the goal.

“I think I’d be lying,” freshman 

center Hunter Dickinson said at the 

Big Ten Tournament, “if not every 

single player in that locker room fully 

believes that we are the best team in 

the country and that we will still win 

the national championship.”

That was right after a one-point 

loss to Ohio State knocked Michi-

gan out of the Big Ten Tournament, 

when the Wolverines were still reel-

ing, having learned the night before 

that Livers had suffered a stress 

fracture in his foot. The only game 

Michigan has played since then, a 

first-round matchup against 16-seed 

Texas Southern, amounted to a 

scrimmage with the window dress-

ings of March.

So, what do we know about Mich-

igan without Isaiah Livers? Probably 

less than we think we do.

“Every guy has to step up, it’s not 

just one particular guy,” Howard 

said. “And Brandon (Johns Jr.) is 

the guy who’s filled in as far as the 

starting lineup, but not putting any 

added pressure on Brandon. It’s each 

and every guy who understands that 

when a player goes down, we sup-

port him, but we gotta of course trust 

that the other guys (are) gonna be 

out there on the floor, they’re gonna 

go out there and compete from start 

to finish.”

Johns, at least in the last two 

games, has held his own. Michigan 

even got some encouraging signs 

from freshmen guard Zeb Jackson 

and forward Terrance Williams 

against Texas Southern; though, 

that was the second-worst team the 

Wolverines have played all year by 

KenPom rank. 

All of that is, in a lot of ways, ancil-

lary. Good for the Wolverines if they 

can survive a few minutes with their 

deep bench on the court. Howev-

er, they won’t beat LSU on Monday 

without getting more from the best 

five players in their rotation.

That means Hunter Dickinson, 

who fouled out against Texas South-

ern after committing six turnovers. 

And Franz Wagner, who fouled 

out against Ohio State and hasn’t 

reached double-digit scoring in 

the last two games. And Chaundee 

Brown Jr., who has a total of three 

points since Michigan announced 

that Livers has a stress fracture in 

his foot.

Point guard Mike Smith looked 

ready to go against Texas Southern, 

with 18 points in his first ever NCAA 

Tournament game. So did senior Eli 

Brooks, hitting early 3-pointers to set 

the tone. The rest need to follow.

They didn’t when Brooks was 

hurt, earlier in the year. That’s when 

Michigan played its worst game of 

the year, a blowout loss on the road 

at Minnesota. When Brooks went 

out with an ankle injury at Mich-

igan State in the season’s last reg-

ular season game, the Wolverines 

couldn’t handle that either, losing 

70-64. It might be easier to play 

without Livers than without Brooks 

— Michigan has wing depth, but not 

guard depth. But that doesn’t mean 

it’s easy.

With Livers, Michigan is a team 

whose depth is its strength. Without 

him, it’s a team that will go as far as 

its best five can take it. The Wolver-

ines can’t have foul trouble, a cold 

Chaundee Brown, a turnover-laden 

performance from their best player.

They can survive without Livers, 

sure, and certainly they can do so 

against an LSU team that ranks 121st 

in adjusted defensive efficiency — 

third-worst of any remaining NCAA 

Tournament team.

But the margin for error is low. 

Really low. Give the Tigers a window 

and they’ll run right through it.

“LSU, they’re very skilled, yes 

they do have a backcourt of two 

amazing players in (Javonte) Smart 

as well as (Cam) Thomas,” Howard 

said. “We’re gonna do our best to try 

to contain them.”

Those guys — Smart, Thomas 

and Trendon Watford — are some of 

the best scorers in the country. It’ll 

be on Michigan’s guys to meet the 

moment, and it’ll be on Howard to 

figure out how.

Inside Erik Bakich’s decades of recruiting success

In Michigan’s third game of the 

2021 season, Griffin Mazur took 

a short stride and a quick swing, 

sending the ball skywards before it 

landed just over the left-centerfield 

fence for a grand slam. 

Mazur’s teammates charged out 

of the dugout, swarming him with 

hugs and backslaps. But Michigan 

baseball fans watching from home 

probably didn’t feel as familiar. 

He was making his second ever 

appearance for the Wolverines, but 

he wasn’t a freshman.

The fifth-year senior catcher is one 

of six transfers joining Michigan this 

season. In most of Michigan coach 

Erik Bakich’s tenure, he has almost 

entirely recruited high schoolers 

and relied on their season-to-season 

development, but he elected to add 

the additional dimension of ready-

made graduate transfers this season. 

The Wolverines’ 7-1 start is less 

a reflection of Bakich’s ability to 

develop than his ability to recruit, 

a skill that he’s honed for nearly 20 

years. 

***

Long ago, Erik Bakich wasn’t 

particularly interested in coaching, 

let alone recruiting. He graduated 

from East Carolina, where he hit 

.315 with a 1.000 fielding percentage 

in 2000, before beginning a short 

professional playing career with 

several independent league teams.

In the fall of 2001, Bakich was 

taking batting practice on the East 

Carolina campus when Pirates 

coach Keith LeClair approached him 

with news that a volunteer assistant 

coaching position had opened at 

Clemson. 

“I said, ‘Really, do you think 

I should have interest in that?’ ” 

Bakich asked LeClair. 

“And then I took another swing, 

and immediately after watching me 

take another swing, he said, ‘Yes, you 

need to be interested in that.’ ”

Slightly crestfallen, Bakich took 

his coach’s advice, and soon after, 

took the position.

Despite poor conditions — he 

was compensated in T-shirts and 

Gatorade bars, and the Southern 

heat often woke him up at night — 

Bakich loved his season at Clemson. 

He worked closely with Tigers 

assistant 
coach 
and 
recruiting 

coordinator Tim Corbin, a former 

National Assistant Coach of the Year 

who shared Bakich’s penchant for 

long hours and hard work. 

Corbin taught Bakich how to 

recruit, often by example. 

“He was extremely thorough,” 

Bakich said. “He made a ton of 

phone calls, did a lot of digging and 

background checks and gathered 

information. He knew a lot about 

every player before he even went to 

go watch him play. And then when he 

would go watch them play, he would 

be the first one there and the last 

one to leave, just paying attention to 

every little thing. So many recruiters 

just show up at game time, watch 

the game and leave, and maybe 

don’t sit in the front row and see the 

mannerisms and the body language 

and the interaction with teammates 

and coaches.

“Everything is a piece. It’s one 

gigantic puzzle, and every piece 

of information that you can get 

determines if this is the right fit for 

the program or what type of player 

you’re getting. Getting to know the 

family and how the kid was raised is 

such a large dynamic that goes into 

putting these puzzle pieces together. 

“He was just the best I had seen 

doing all of it.”

Impressed by Corbin’s affinity for 

thoroughness, Bakich followed him 

to Nashville as an assistant coach 

and recruiting coordinator when 

Corbin became Vanderbilt’s head 

coach in 2003.

“(Bakich) told me that I couldn’t 

hire anyone better than him and that 

no one would care more about the 

program than him,” Corbin said. “He 

didn’t say that in a bragging manner 

at all; he said it because he believed 

in it.”

The Commodores weren’t the 

powerhouse they are today. They 

had been SEC bottom-dwellers for 

the previous decade, and Bakich, 

Corbin and pitching coach Derek 

Johnson initially received far more 

rejections than acceptances from 

recruited players. According to 

Corbin, the coaching staff had to 

work hard to establish a recruiting 

foundation.

Modern perspective shows that 

they succeeded.

A few seasons into Bakich’s seven 

year tenure, Vanderbilt reached the 

NCAA Regionals and successfully 

recruited eventual major leaguers, 

like Mike Baxter and Ryan Flaherty, 

with greater regularity. In 2005, the 

Commodores pulled in the nation’s 

top-ranked class, led by left-hander 

David Price.

Price went to nearby Blackman 

High School, where he starred in 

baseball and basketball. Bakich 

noticed his outstanding athletic 

ability — including a loose, whippy 

arm that fired fastballs at a higher 

velocity than nearly anyone — as well 

as the need for some refinement.

“You could tell that this was 

somebody who, 25 pounds from now 

and a couple of birthdays away, is 

going to be something super special,” 

Bakich said. 

Price was selected in the 19th 

round of the MLB draft after his 

senior year of high school, but he 

chose to go to Vanderbilt in large 

part thanks to the expert recruiting 

ability of Corbin and his staff. Corbin 

won him over with bold predictions 

for the future that included an 

SEC championship and a No. 1 

selection in the 2007 MLB draft, 

both of which came true. Bakich 

played a key role in securing the left-

hander’s commitment by building a 

relationship with Price’s parents.

“I think once the parents have a 

mindset of, ‘We want our child to 

go to school,’ then the child has a 

mindset of going to school,” Corbin 

said. “If (it’s) open-ended and the 

parent allows the child to make a 

decision … they usually go down a 

different route. And I think (Bakich) 

cultivated a good relationship with 

Bonnie and Deb, in order to get 

David here.”

Beyond a search for talent, 

Bakich and Corbin prioritized the 

recruitment of players with excellent 

character. Nearly 20 years later, they 

continue to reap the benefits of those 

choices. Price made a $2.5 million 

donation to improve Vanderbilt’s 

baseball facilities, and Bakich stays 

in regular contact with several 

players, including Baxter, Antoan 

Richardson and David Macias. 

“As coach Corbin would say, those 

are the paychecks that you continue 

to get, whether it’s a wedding invite 

or a birth announcement or a job 

promotion,” Bakich said. That’s the 

best part of recruiting — building 

lifelong relationships.”

***

After a combined eight years as 

the head coaches at Maryland and 

Michigan, Bakich’s multitude of 

experience has shown its value in 

the prominence of under-recruited 

players turned Wolverine stars.

In 2018, Bakich sat with stopwatch 

in hand in the grandstand at Lincoln 

Trail Community College to watch a 

guy best known for his high school 

football abilities. Jordan Brewer 

went 1-4 — two groundouts, a single 

and a strikeout. But Bakich was sold, 

impressed with his footspeed when 

he put the ball in play, his defense in 

center field and his high energy. 

The two shared a post-game 

dinner at Subway, during which 

Brewer talked about his Native 

American 
background 
and 

upbringing. 
Their 
conversation 

informed Bakich that regardless of 

the type of player Brewer would be at 

Michigan, he would add a lot of value 

to the program with his personality 

alone. 

Brewer, who hit .360 with 12 

home runs and 73 RBI in his two 

seasons at Lincoln Trail, had 

multiple scholarship offers, but his 

positive interactions with Bakich 

made the choice easier. 

“He really cares about you and 

gets to know you super quick,” 

Brewer said in an interview with 

MLive. “He knew all about me even 

before I went up there to visit. I am a 

huge family guy, and when I saw he 

knew me and my family already, that 

was huge. I was already bought in.”

In his one year with the 

Wolverines, Brewer led the team 

in batting average (.329), hits (81), 

slugging percentage (.557), stolen 

bases (25) and several other offensive 

categories. But Michigan’s biggest 

offensive asset in 2019 — who 

surpassed even Brewer in advanced 

metrics like runs created and wOBA 

— was Jordan Nwogu, another 

lightly-recruited 
former 
football 

player. Nwogu earned an academic 

scholarship to the University and 

only committed to the baseball 

program during the fall of his senior 

year in high school, quite late in the 

recruiting process.

Bakich would never have noticed 

either of these eventual standouts 

if he strictly recruited through the 

traditional channels like showcases, 

or if he evaluated players on the 

basis of physical skills alone. He had 

learned the importance of attention 

to intangibles like work ethic and 

character from Corbin.

“There are kids all over the 

country who are very talented 

physically,” Bakich said. “But you just 

can never compromise with those 

intangible skills. Nothing will ever 

replace old fashioned hard work. 

And when you start to get to know 

how these kids were raised, what 

makes them tick and what drives 

them, you start to understand very 

quickly that any deficiencies they 

may have physically, they’re going 

to figure it out because there’s a high 

care level for what they’re doing. 

But you won’t know that unless you 

really do the digging to find out.”

***

Bakich’s recruitment of Brewer 

and Nwogu paid off nearly instantly, 

with the two leading the Wolverines 

to a College World Series appearance 

in 2019. It netted the program long-

term returns, too, with more and 

more talented high school players 

interested in bringing Michigan 

back to Omaha. 

“Kids look at that success and 

want to be a part of it,” assistant 

coach Nick Schnabel said. “It’s 

probably made the pool a little bit 

bigger for us, no question.”

After coming within a game of 

a national championship, Bakich 

and his coaching staff are fiending 

to return to that level on a regular 

basis. The first step toward that 

goal is recruiting consistently strong 

classes. 

The Wolverines lost a significant 

portion of their contributors to 

the pros after the 2020 season, so 

they began an exhaustive search 

for replacements in the transfer 

portal. Schnabel took the lead at the 

beginning of the recruiting process, 

watching most of the film, making 

most of the calls and performing 

background checks. By the time 

Bakich became involved, Schnabel 

had whittled about 100 names into a 

shortlist of contenders. 

These efforts, reminiscent of 

Corbin and Bakich’s thoroughness 

at Vanderbilt, have paid dividends, as 

Michigan’s transfers have impressed 

on and off the field so far this year. 

Mazur was elected a team captain 

and hits for better power and average 

than former catcher Joe Donovan. 

Fifth-year shortstop Benjamin Sems 

has a better fielding percentage than 

former shortstop Jack Blomgren. 

Sophomore outfielder Jake Marti 

hits beyond description.

With the success of his many 

transfers, Bakich is currently seeing 

what he hopes will be another in a 

long line of strong recruiting classes 

— one that he hopes can play deep 

into the summer.

As various instances of inequitable 

treatment from the men’s and wom-

en’s NCAA basketball tournaments 

circulate the internet, the optics are 

damning. 

To 
start, 

there 
have 

been 
images 

showing 
the 

difference 

between men’s 

and 
women’s 

weight rooms. 

There 
have 

been 
similar 

images regarding “swag bags” at the 

men’s and women’s tournaments. 

Moreover, there have been less tangi-

ble disparities in that the men’s tour-

nament is the only to use the branding 

of “March Madness” and “the Big 

Dance.”

On appearance alone, these condi-

tions require explanation. And, quite 

frankly, the NCAA has failed to pro-

vide justifiable explanations for their 

actions at every turn.

“In part, (the lack of a women’s 

weight room) is due to the limit-

ed space,” NCAA Vice President of 

Women’s Basketball Lynn Holzman-

said in a statement released by the 

NCAA on Mar. 18. “And the original 

plan was to expand the workout area 

once additional space was available 

later in the tournament.”

Without context, this explanation 

already seems weak considering the 

months of planning that went into 

this year’s tournament on account of 

COVID-19, but we do have context 

here. And the context makes matters 

worse.

As a video captured by Oregon for-

ward Sedona Prince shows, the space 

was there the whole time. Just behind 

the abysmal setup the NCAA provid-

ed, a wide-open floor space capable 

of holding a much more adequate 

weight room awaits.

It doesn’t make sense. 

The NCAA decided to hold its 

entire women’s tournament in a San 

Antonio bubble at the beginning of 

February. And while there is obvious-

ly a lot that goes into planning such an 

event, it seems highly improbable that 

there could be a misstep in something 

as simple as space availability.

There is just no way that, with all 

the concerns over space relevant to 

conducting a large, bubble-style tour-

nament during the COVID-19 pan-

demic, the NCAA hadn’t thoroughly 

considered potential spatial issues 

before booking the San Antonio ven-

ues.

Even more, a proper weight room 

is fundamental to the preparation and 

success of collegiate athletes. And as 

such, providing appropriate facilities 

for women’s tournament participants 

should not have been an afterthought. 

With all of this being said, blaming 

the lack of proper facilities on a lack of 

space isn’t a settling explanation, it’s 

an excuse, and a false one at that.

The merchandise provided to each 

group shows an equivalent disparity. 

While the men received a vast “swag 

bag” of goods ranging from towels to 

T-shirts to banners all emblazoned 

with “March Madness” or “The 

Big Dance” branding, the women 

received a scant package of generic 

“NCAA” and “women’s basketball” 

branded merchandise. 

The NCAA has provided a state-

ment about these packages, but 

they would have to do a lot better 

than “there wasn’t enough space” to 

explain away this unequal treatment. 

And to put it simply, they didn’t.

Holzman stresses in that public 

statement that the dollar values of the 

two bags were equal, but one certain-

ly does not get that impression from 

looking at the images.

It would be understandable that 

the men’s and women’s merchandise 

teams would have created different 

bags if they were given an equivalent 

value to use and then sent their sep-

arate ways to fill that total, but that’s 

not what happened. 

In fact, Holzman explains that the 

men’s and women’s staffs “proactive-

ly” worked together on making the 

bags. So, what explains away the dif-

ference in appearance?

The answer cannot be equivalent 

value because optics matter and, 

again, the optics are damning. Maybe 

an excuse is that the NCAA doesn’t 

use its trademarked phrase “March 

Madness” for the women’s tourna-

ment, so it doesn’t make sense to give 

them branded material. 

But again, why not brand the wom-

en’s tournament?

There is nothing different about 

what teams have to do to get into the 

men’s and women’s tournaments. 

There is nothing any less difficult 

about making a deep run in the tour-

nament. And there is nothing that 

makes earning such an appearance 

or run any less meaningful for the 

women than to the men.

Put simply, this matter of branding, 

which is likely intended to preserve 

the integrity of the men’s tourna-

ment’s magic, binds the women’s 

tournament to a lack of comparable 

spectacle.

You don’t even have to give the 

“March Madness” or “the Big Dance” 

branding to the women’s tournament, 

NCAA. You only need to give the 

women’s tournament a brand of com-

parable appeal and consistency.

The fact that the women’s tour-

nament is completely unbranded 

is insulting, and it belies a lack of 

respect for the efforts of the stu-

dent-athletes, coaches and staff 

involved. In 2021, there is no excuse 

for blatant preferential treatment of 

male athletes, and the NCAA is more 

than wise enough to know it needs 

to take specific measures to ensure 

equality in how it provides for its 

male and female athletes, no matter 

the sport.

I don’t care about revenue differ-

ences; the NCAA makes $1 billion in 

revenue each year and the disrespect 

of women’s sports is a large part of 

why women’s basketball does not 

bring in more of that revenue. The 

NCAA must acknowledge the power 

it has over people’s opinions about 

men’s and women’s sports and the 

power it holds over young female ath-

letes’ self-esteem.

As Michigan softball coach Carol 

Hutchins said via Twitter Mar. 19, “It 

is time to consider ALL the athletes, 

ALL the time!”

Hutchins is absolutely right, and 

it is time that the NCAA catches up 

with the moment.

And to do so, the NCAA must start 

with providing better explanations 

for its current mistreatment.

The NCAA’s excuses don’t add up

JACOB 
COHEN 

JULIA SCHACHINGER/Daily

The NCAA has come under fire after social media posts exposed disparities between the two tournaments.

Wolverines manage to withstand runs in back-and-forth affair

INDIANAPOLIS — There’s an old 

saying in Indiana — and everywhere 

the sport is played — that basketball is 

a game of runs. 

The track meet that was the 

Michigan men’s basketball team’s 

second-round, 86-78 win against LSU 

on Monday night certainly lived up to 

that adage. 

After a late first-half surge got them 

back in the game, the Wolverines held 

a slim one-point lead over the Tigers 

at halftime. Virtually deadlocked 

coming out of the break, both teams 

had everything to play for. 

LSU went on a quick 8-2 run to 

regain the lead and momentum. 

Every time the Tigers threatened 

to pull away, though, Michigan had 

an answer. Graduate guard Mike 

Smith and senior guard Eli Brooks hit 

consecutive 3-pointers to stop LSU’s 

scoring spurt in its tracks.

“Our guys kept grinding it, 

grinding it,” Michigan coach Juwan 

Howard said. “Each possession, we 

got stops when we needed it. We also 

continued to attack the basket and not 

settle. But we also made some good 

shots that were open.”

Throughout the half, the teams 

went back and forth, trading six 

and seven-point runs. For a while it 

seemed like whichever team’s run 

coincided with the final buzzer would 

advance to the Sweet Sixteen. 

The Wolverines, grounded by 

their veterans, not only withstood the 

barrage, but wouldn’t let that scenario 

come to be.

After knocking down two free 

throws, senior guard Chaundee 

Brown Jr. hit one of his three triples 

on the night to put Michigan up 

by eight at the 5:57 minute mark. 

The Tigers tried to recover, but the 

Wolverines had had enough of the 

game’s seesawing nature. 

“(My teammates and coaches) told 

me before the game, ‘Come in and 

be aggressive, just play basketball,’ ” 

Brown said. “I had a talk with myself 

before the game, ‘Just be you.’ I feel 

like I did that.” 

Michigan’s advantage would only 

vacillate from six to 10 the rest of the 

way. 

“We couldn’t string together 

enough stops,” LSU coach Will Wade 

said. “We could just never string 

together enough stops to make a run 

and to expand our lead. … After we 

got the six-point lead, we gave up a 

couple threes, we missed a floater 

in the lane. We could never sustain 

what we were doing.”

Added Brooks: “To be honest, 

it was just about wearing on them, 

making everything tough. … It was 

mostly just staying the course.”

Howard had told his team that a 

win against the Tigers would require 

them to “empty the tank.” Facing a 

do-or-die situation, the Wolverines 

responded in a big way. Having 

experienced back-and-forth contests 

throughout the Big Ten season, 

Michigan had been in a similar 

position before. The Wolverines 

were never fazed and delivered the 

knockout blow when the opportunity 

presented itself.

“We (didn’t) wanna go back to the 

hotel regretting ‘I shoulda did this, 

I coulda did this,’ ” Brown said. “We 

have an off day tomorrow, go all out. 

I feel like that really sticks to all of us. 

Like (Howard) says all the time, we 

want to rest on April 6.”

Thanks to the cool heads of 

veterans like Brooks and Brown, the 

Wolverines won’t be resting for very 

long.

The Wolverines overcame an early LSU run en route to an 86-78 win.

Brooks keys ‘M’ win over LSU

INDIANAPOLIS — With 30 

seconds on the clock, an errant 

shot in the lane by Louisiana 

State’s Cameron Thomas bounced 

off the left side of the rim. As the 

Tigers’ Trendon Watford lunged 

for the rebound, he found himself 

outmuscled by senior guard Eli 

Brooks. Standing at just 6-foot-

2, Brooks came away with the 

rebound before calmly hitting 

two free throws on the other end, 

putting the finishing touches on an 

88-76 win for the Michigan men’s 

basketball team to advance to its 

fourth consecutive Sweet Sixteen.

It’s fitting that Brooks was the 

man to clinch the Wolverines’ victory 

in an electric shootout. In the early 

stages of the game, Brooks sparked 

a seemingly dormant Michigan 

offense with an early barrage of 

3-pointers. Brooks, who hit five of his 

nine attempts from beyond the arc, is 

shooting a blistering 53.3% from deep 

through two tournament games.

“My shot is feeling as good as it 

has all year,” Brooks said. “Coaches 

always say next shot mentality, take 

the shots when you’re open. That’s 

what I’ve been doing.”

Brooks’s barrage from long 

range proved to be instrumental 

in the Wolverines keeping pace 

with an LSU offense that ranks 

as the nation’s fifth-best unit, 

according to KenPom. The Tigers’ 

lead ballooned to as much as nine 

in the first half, with Thomas and 

backcourt partner Javonte Smart 

hitting long contested jumpers 

with an efficiency usually only seen 

in layup lines. With LSU’s offense 

showing no signs of taking its foot 

off the gas pedal, Michigan needed 

to cultivate a rebuttal.

WIth three 3-pointers and 13 

first half points, Brooks answered 

the call.

“Eli has been like this since the 

last year I started coaching him,” 

Michigan coach Juwan Howard 

said. “He’s a basketball guy, has a 

high IQ. Very underrated in a lot of 

ways offensively and defensively.”

Brooks continued to come up with 

big buckets in the second half. With 

the Wolverines trailing by three, 

Brooks nailed a 3-pointer to knot the 

score at 51 apiece. Just three minutes 

later, he delivered again from the left 

corner. With senior forward Isaiah 

Livers out indefinitely with a stress 

fracture, Michigan was left without 

a clear-cut go-to scorer when in 

need of a bucket. 

If tonight was Brooks’s audition 

to fill that role, he aced it.

“The coaches have always been 

on me about being aggressive, 

taking my shots. (Howard’s) on 

everybody because we believe 

everybody’s really talented on the 

team. It’s just about confidence 

and instilling confidence into each 

other.”

By the end of the night, Brooks 

produced perhaps the best game 

of his senior campaign, scoring 

21 points on an efficient 7-for-11 

shooting. As effective as he was 

scoring the basketball, he was 

equally as effective setting up his 

teammates for buckets of their 

own, registering a team-high seven 

assists. Seen on the surface to many 

as being primarily a defensive piece 

of the Wolverines’ equation, Brooks 

proved with more eyeballs on him 

than ever that he is much more than 

that. 

You could even say he may 

end up being the Wolverines’ 

most essential ingredient to a 

championship-winning formula.

“Sometimes you look at a guy’s 

numbers, you say he deserves to be 

on the defensive team,” Howard 

said. “Well, watch our games, you 

understand why we appreciate 

Eli and what he brings to the table 

night in and night out. He’s our glue 

guy.”

Pitching shines as Michigan falls to MSU

Senior 
right-hander 
Blake 

Beers threw his third consecutive 

curveball in the dirt and racked up 

his third consecutive swing and 

miss to retire the batter. He walked 

to the dugout at the end of the fifth 

inning, greeted by his enthusiastic 

teammates.

It was Beers’s best start of the 

season to date; but it wasn’t enough. 

The Michigan baseball team held 

Michigan State to just four hits in 

the entire game, yet lost 3-0. Beers 

threw 100 pitches over 5.2 innings, 

allowing just one earned run, but 

in the end Michigan couldn’t come 

through.

“He was much better today. 

Just a better job of getting ahead 

of 
hitters, 
minimizing 
base 

runners,” Michigan coach Erik 

Bakich said. “Between Blake and 

Joe (Pace) and Willie (Weiss), 

their stuff was excellent, they 

were all throwing mid 90s. That’s 

the hardest Blake’s ever thrown, 

touching 97 and he just had good 

stuff.”

The stellar defense the team 

has played throughout the season 

continued, with junior infielder 

Riley Bertram making a leaping 

catch in the fourth inning to snag a 

line drive heading for the gap. Fifth-

year infielder Christian Molfetta 

also made several critical plays, and 

fifth-year infielder Benjamin Sems 

was in typical form, making several 

key contributions from shortstop.

“Throwing 
to 
(fifth-year 

catcher Griffin Mazur) gives 

everyone on the staff a ton of 

confidence, 
everyone 
on 
the 

defense is great so everyone has 

a ton of confidence throwing,” 

graduate right-hander Joe Pace 

said. “We know we have an elite 

defense in Sems and Bertram 

and Molfetta. … We have an elite 

defense and that’s really our 

strength as a staff because we 

trust them so much.”

Beers was replaced by Pace, 

who looked sharp as he allowed 

just one hit and no runs over 2.1 

innings, continuing his strong 

start to the season. Junior right-

hander Willie Weiss replaced 

Pace for the ninth with Michigan 

down two runs and he recorded 

three outs on the four batters he 

faced, although he would allow 

an insurance run by way of a solo 

blast.

“You talk about a guy who 

was just dominant, really found 

his stride,” Sems said of Beers. 

“I mean he was throwing 96, 97, 

that’s gonna play any day. He’s a 

grinder out there and he gave us 

everything, every opportunity 

that we need to win that game. He 

pitched really well.”

In the end, the off day hitting 

was not enough to capitalize on 

the stellar pitching for Michigan.

“It’s unfortunate we couldn’t 

create any offense behind (Beers),” 

Bakich said. “But we certainly 

pitched well enough to win today.”

BROOKS, BROWN JR.
LEAD MICHIGAN TO WILD

VICTORY OVER LSU

INDIANAPOLIS — By the end of it, Michigan could finally exhale. 

Eli Brooks wiggled free from a scrum with the rebound as serenades of cheers washed down from a 

boisterous crowd. In the frontcourt, he dribbled out the inevitable.

A special season will last at least one more game. 

In a high-flying shootout, the Wolverines (22-4 overall, 14-3 Big Ten) outlasted upset-minded LSU 

(19-10), 86-78, to punch a ticket to the Sweet Sixteen. For the fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament, 

Michigan survives into the second weekend. 

“That’s where you want to be, that’s where you dream of playing,” Brooks said after the game with a 

smile. “That’s what we expect at Michigan. But you have to earn it.” 

The upstart Tigers ensured the Wolverines did just that. For forty minutes, Michigan could not so 

much as breathe. 

LSU’s much-acclaimed fifth-ranked offense proved to be as advertised. The Tigers, buoyed by 

freshman sensation Cameron Thomas, roared out of the gates with an 8-2 start. Thomas, utilizing his 

6-foot-4 frame to shoot over a series of smaller defenders, tallied a quick eight points of his own. 

Michigan’s offense floundered, enabling LSU to carry a nine point advantage deep into the 

first half. The Wolverines failed to capitalize on their height advantage — forward 

Darius Days, at 6-foot-7, drew the assignment on 7-foot-1 freshman center Hunter 

Dickinson. Throughout the first 13 minutes, Dickinson managed just one field 

goal attempt. 

An emerging track meet seemed to play into LSU’s hands. During 

timeouts, the Michigan huddle remained optimistic. 

“There were a lot of possessions out there where we could have held 

our head down because LSU made a great run, got the lead early in 

the first half,” Michigan coach Juwan Howard said. “But our team 

stayed the course.”

After scuffling early, Michigan weathered the blitz, exploiting 

a porous LSU defense that entered with the 124th ranked unit 

in KenPom’s adjusted defensive efficiency. Senior guard Eli 

Brooks led the charge with 13 first-half points, including a trio 

of 3-pointers. 

LSU’s white-hot start proved unsustainable. Though 

the Tigers led for all but two minutes in the first half, 

Michigan claimed a tenuous one-point advantage at the 

break.

“I think the defense really sparked it, sparked 

our pace,” Brooks said. “Just the intensity that we 

brought on the defensive end. We limited them to 

one shot. We made everything hard in those four 

minutes and rebound(ed) the ball, got out, ran 

in transition.” 

Momentum, though, proved to be fleeting. 

An early 8-0 spurt placed the Wolverines 

back on their heels, ensuing a seesaw affair. 

Michigan responded with a 10-0 run. The 

Tigers, ever resilient, battled back with an 8-0 

stretch of their own. 

An air-balled 3-pointer from Brooks, 

followed by a Thomas 3-pointer, stretched the 

LSU lead to five. Again, Michigan managed to respond. 

With 8:57 minutes to go, senior guard Chaundee Brown Jr. drilled a catch-

and-shoot 3-pointer from the corner. Minutes later, he again found the back of 

the net, stretching the Michigan lead to eight. 

Brown, bouncing back down the court, turned around to face thousands 

of Michigan fans, thrusting his arms into the air and basking in his 

newfound glory. The Wolverines, after 34 minutes spent enduring punches, 

could taste it. 

With 3:56 minutes to play, the tide turned permanently. Sophomore 

wing Franz Wagner, scuffling throughout most of the game, drained 

an off-the-dribble 3-pointer, putting Michigan up a game-high nine. 

On his way back down the court, he pounded his chest, arms raised in 

celebration.

At last, the pesky Tigers relented, long faces draping their 

countenances. 

Michigan danced up the tunnel. Howard, lingering behind for 

a radio interview, was the last man off the court. Motioning to the 

fans on hand, he held up four fingers — one for each victory the 

Wolverines need to capture a championship.

“The motto of today was, the words that were shared with the 

group: empty the tank, empty the tank,” Howard said. “Our guys did 

that.”

And finally, they could let out a collective sigh of relief.
