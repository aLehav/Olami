FACULTY GOVERNANCE
SACUA mulls
resolution on
state same-sex
benefits bill

Members support
current University
policy concerning
partner benefits
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's leading faculty gov-
ernance body is taking a stand against
the state Legislature's attempt to block
benefits for domestic partners.
In response to a bill passed by the
state House of Representatives that
would take away medical and fringe
bo efitsfrom employees' domestic part-
nes, members of the Senate Advisory
Committee for University Affairs dis-

cussed their proposed resolution in sup-
port of the University's current policy at
their meeting yesterday.
The University currently provides
health benefits to gay and lesbian cou-
ples as well as unmarried heterosexual
couples as per a University Board of
Regents bylaw. However, the Michigan
Senate is trying to pass bill 4770, which
would prohibit employers from provid-
ing medical or fringe benefits to anyone
who is not married to or a dependent of
an employee.
The resolution states that SACUA
supports the University's current ben-
efits policy, which provides benefits to
those who the University defines as a
"qualified adult." To do otherwise, the
resolution states; would hinder the Uni-
versity's efforts to acquire the best fac-

Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform shows graphic
images on Diag
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
Large signs warned passersby
entering the Diag yesterday that
graphic images were up ahead.
The images were part of a day long
photo exhibit of the Genocide Aware-
ness Project that displayed photos
of aborted fetuses next to images of
Holocaust victims, the genocide in
Darfur and a lynching of an African

American person. The project is an
effort of the California-based Center
for Bio-Ethical Reform, and the cam-
pus organization Students for Life
reserved the space on the Diag for the
exhibit.
A truck bearing images of aborted
fetuses also circled Central Campus
throughoutthe day. In an interview on
the Diag yesterday, Darius Hardwick,
regional director for the Center for
Bio-Ethical Reform, said the exhibit
makes a relevant connection between
genocide and abortion.
"The basic comparison of the simi-
larity between abortion and (the)
Holocaust is lots of dead victims,"
.Hardwick said. "There (ore) lots of

other comparisons - like you have to
dehumanize a victim before you can
kill them, and that was done in the
Holocaust."
The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform
brings the exhibit to different places
throughout the country, mainly to
college campuses, according to Hard-
wick.
"It is the prime demographic of peo-
ple having abortions," Hardwick said.
He added that college campuses
are also better suited for the organi-

AATA, MDOT, Amtrak
to collaborate on
new train station
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily Staff Reporter
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
announced continued progress on sev-
eral rail initiatives at the City Council
meeting last night.
Hieftje said $2.8 million in fund-
ing from the federal government will
be used by the Ann Arbor Transit
Authority, the Michigan Department
of Transportation and other organiza-

tions to implement plans for the Fuller.
Road train station.
"One of the beauties
of that for Ann Arbor
and for the Fuller Road i
Station and all of our
partners - Amtrak,
AATA, MDOT - is
that the track improve-
ments that are needed for the commut-
er rail will also be going forward and
will be paid forby the federal funding,"
Hieftje said.
The Fuller Road Station initiative
has tried to bring a new train station to
the city for several years. The space is
currently a paved parking lot acrossthe
street from the Fuller Park Pool and.

Soccer Complex.
Hieftje expressed his excitement for
the rail initiative and pointed out that
there is a total of $380 million coming
into the state to improve rail systems
throughout Michigan. These funds,
he said, will guarantee the purchase of
rail between Detroit and Kalamazoo,
Mich. for improved train service.
"Everything is going forward and
looking very good for rail transit here
in Southeast Michigan and actually
across the state," Hieftje said.
He addedthatMDOT, which already
owns the trains for the commuter rail,
is looking to move forward with the
project to potentially include service

GREEK LIFE
Originally founded at the University, Acacia fraternity returns to campus

Fraternity left campus
in 1994 due to finances
By PHOEBE BARGHOUTY
For the Daily
After a i7-year hiatus, a fraternity
founded at the University is getting
ready to return to its birthplace.

The Interfraternity Council has
allowed Acacia Fraternity to begin
recruiting to once again establish a
chapter at the University, where it was
created in 1904. The fraternity left the
University in 1994 due to logistical and
financial reasons, according to Ben
Haddad, a leadership consultant with
Acacia, and Joe Psyk, the director - of
expansion and recruitment for the Aca-

cia Headquarters, who is working to re-
establish the campus chapter.
When the IFC - the student-run
governing body of 31 fraternities at the
University - extended an invitation to
Acacia .for fall recruitment, Psyk and
Haddad said members of the national
organization were very excited. They
said they're hoping the opportunity for
undergraduate men at the University

to become "re-founding fathers" will
attract an ample pledge class.
"We want to continue with the rich
heritage we have with the University,"
Psyk said.
Acacia's history at the University
includes helping to get the bronze 'M'
placed in the middle of the Diag. The
fraternity brothers petitioned then-
University President Harlan Hatcher

to install a new 'M' in the Diag after
the previous one was destroyed during
renovations, according to an article in
the December 1952 edition of Acacia's
newsletter.
Haddad said he hopes potential
pledges realize they could have a unique
opportunity to start a new legacy.
"You get to be a re-founding father,"

Legendary hockey coach dies at 87

Five years ago this week (Oct. 5,
2006): Legendary Michigan hockey
coach Vic Heyliger, who led the Wol-
verines to six NCAA championships
throughout the 1940s and 1950s, died at
age 87.
Heyliger first came to the University
as a student in 1934 to play hockey. He
returned in 1944 to coach the Wolverines
and spent 13 seasonsbehind the bench.
"He set a standard at Michigan that
will probably never be equaled in terms
of national championships," current
Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson
said in a statement to The Michigan
Daily at the time. "That was a special
time in the history of Michigan hockey.
He really built Michigan hockey."
20 years ago this week (Oct. 4,1991):
Journalists at The Lantern, the student
newspaper at The Ohio State University,

went on strike after they felt the uni-
versity was threatening their editorial
freedom.
OSU's School of Journalism
announced a policy that would have
given the school's director or the news-
paper adviser the ability to prevent arti-
cles from being published if they felt the
piece was libelous.
"'We are fighting the principle of the
thing," Lantern Editorial Editor Melissa
Romig told the Daily at the time. "We
are worried that todaythey may be pull-
ing things deemed potentially libelous,
and tomorrow it could be anything that
makes a regent look bad. Once you start
taking rights away, it is very hard to get
those back."
To protest the policy, an edition of
The Lantern consisted of a single story
about the dispute, and the text of the

First Amendment was published several
times throughout the paper.
40 years ago this week (Oct. 5,1971):
The Senate Assembly, the University's
lead faculty governing body, endorsed
a plan to end most classified research at
the University.
A drafting committee was appointed
to write a formal proposal to submit
to the University's Board of Regents
for approval. According to the Sen-
ate Assembly plan, covert research
would only be justified when the study
"contribute(s) so significantly to the
advancement of knowledge."'
The proposal also banned research
with "the specific purpose or clearly
foreseeable result of which is to destroy
human life or to incapacitate human
beings."

of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, said
the Haqqani network, which is

of Pakistan's intelligence agency.
Mullen accused the Haqqani net-

He claimed Pakistan's spy agency

However, agovernment minis-
ter said his car was nearby, sug-

About 1,000
residents evacuated,.
no injuries reported
WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) -
A fire sparked as workers mixed
chemicals at a plant south of Dal-
las shot massive plumes of black
smoke and bright orange flames
into the sky yesterday, forcing
schoolchildren and residents to
evacuate or take cover indoors to
avoid possible exposure to dan-
gerous gases.
Flames engulfed a large com-
plex at a Magnablend Inc. facility
in Waxahachie. The fast-moving
blaze overwhelmed a sprinkler
system and consumed a fire truck,
but no injuries were reported from
the fire or resultingsmoke.
Waxahachie Fire Chief David
Hudgins said it wasn't immedi-
ately clear what chemicals were
involved in sparking the fire.
About 1,000 residents who had
been evacuated were allowed to
return to their homes early yes-
terday evening, said Waxahachie
Fire Department spokeswoman
Amy Hollywood. Waxahachie, 30
miles south of Dallas, has about
25,000 residents.
The blaze was 95 percent under
control by early yesterday eve-
ning, Hollywood said.
In a statement, the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency
said it has monitored air quality
both on the ground and through
a specially equippned airplane
that made several passes through
the smoke plume caused by the
blaze and officials have not found
elevated levels of toxic chemicals.
The EPA said it "will continue to
conduct ground level air monitor-
ing."
Magnablend spokesman Don-
ald Golden told WFAA-TV that 25
to 30 employees who were inside
the plant's 100,000-square-foot
warehouse evacuated safely when
the fire broke out before 11 a.m.

Golden said the company manu-
factures about 200 products,
includingsome that are hazardous
when ignited.
Authorities had ordered r-esi-
dents closest to the plant to evacu-
ate, while others were advised to
stay inside with doors and win-
dows shut.
JesseniaColin,anassistantgen-
eral manager at a nearby Hamp-
ton Inn and Suites, said hotel staff
members turned off air vents so
smoke and chemicals didn't enter
the rooms. As they waited for
news and watched the smoke bil-
low, staff covered their mouths to
protect against the heavy chemi-
cal smell that hung in the air.
"It smells like a whole bunch
of chemicals, like wrappers burn-
ing," Colin said. "It's making
everyone's heads hurt."
Stephanie, Otto said she was
preparing her new restaurant for
a Tuesday opening about a quar-
ter-mile from the plant when she
heard sirens and walked outside
to see a "huge plume.' She said
she could hear what sounded like
gun shots for about 15 minutes,
and there was a strong smell of
ammonia.
"It was huge," Otto said. "It
looked like an atomic bomb went
off"
Ellis County emergency man-
agement officials had issued a
mandatory evacuation order for
an apartment complex, an elemen-
tary school and a junior college.
Sheriff's officials had urged resi-
dents not to drive toward the area
of the fire.
Magnablend Inc. manufac-
tures, blends and packages chemi-
cals. Much of its business revolves
around energy production,
including chemicals used to stim-
ulate oil and gas wells and hydrau-
lic fracturing. The company was
launched in Waxahachie in 1979
and now employs about 250 peo-
ple, with operations in Pennsylva-
nia, Wyoming and North Dakota
as well as Texas.

MSU gets $3.6M
to boost pre-teens'
physical activity
The National Institutes of
Health is giving $3.6 million to
Michigan State University to
expand a nursing researcher's
pilot program to help middle
school girls increase their physi-
cal activity.
The program that has been
" in operation in Lansing now
expands to Detroit, Flint, Jack-
son, Kalamazoo and Muskegon.
It's particularly aimed at girls
from minority groups who live in
urban, low-income areas.
The five-year program is called
Girls on the Move, and is headed
by Lorraine Robbins.
The university says the pro-
gram "focuses on individual and
Web-based counseling sessions
with school nurses and an after-
school physical activity club."
Robbins says fewer than 4 per-
cent of middle school girls now
meet physical activity recommen-

U.S. auto sales up
in September on
truck purchases
U.S. buyers shrugged off eco-
nomic worries and snapped up
SUVs and pickups last month,
surprising the auto industry and
raising hopes that a bumpy year
will end on a high note.
Big trucks typically sell when
the housing market and con-
struction industry are strong,
gas prices are low and consumer
confidence is high. None of those
was true in September. The econ-
omy remains weak, confidence is
shaky and a gallon of gas prices
cost nearly $1 per more than in
September 2010.
But other factors boosted truck
sales. Small- businesses -must
eventually-replace aging fleets of
work trucks, and auto companies
offered some good deals to clear
out 2011 model trucks. They also
stepped up their marketing. And
consumers are learning to live
with economic uncertainty.

Oregon bus driver

Oregon's largest transit agency
says it's investigating a complaint
that a driver kicked a woman and
her crying baby off a bus in sub-
urban Portland, saying, "I can't
drive with that noise."
Mary Fetsch, a TriMet
spokeswoman, says drivers are
not supposed to eject passengers
from "vulnerable populations,"
including women transporting
children.

A bus passenger, Jennifer
Chapman, says the baby wasn't
that loud and all the other pas-
sengers got off the bus in protest.
4 The incident allegedly took place
on a bus in Hillsboro on Thursday
night.
Fetsch says she's unsure
whether the bus was equipped
with a video camera.

Registration fees for other

Markets sink as
Greek deficit fears
continue to build

Libya's post-Gadhafi leaders
name new cabinet members

Dow drops 2.4
percent, Euro hits a
9-month low
NEW YORK (AP) - The latest
setback in Greece's financial crisis
sent major stock market indexes
to lows for the year yesterday and
put the Standard and Poor's 500
index on the verge of a bear mar-
ket. The euro fell to a 9-month low
againstthe dollar, and the yield on
the 10-year Treasury note sank as
investors piled money into lower-
risk investments.
The slump came on the first day
of trading for the fourth quarter
and followed the weakest quar-
ter the market has had since the
financial crisis. Stocks opened
lower, turned briefly higher in
late morning trading, then slid
throughout the afternoon. The

Dow Jones industrial average lost
258 points.
European markets slumped
after Greece said it won't be able to
reduce its budget deficits as much
as it had agreed to as part of a deal
to receive more emergency loans.
Markets have responded ner-
vously to headlines out of Europe
for weeks, fearful that if Greece
defaulted on its debt there mightbe
another lockup in the global finan-
cial system, similar to the one trig-
gered by the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008.
"The market is continuing to
trade based on what is happen-
ing in Europe, and that is going
to overshadow everything else,"
said Quincy Krosby, market strat-
egist at Prudential Financial. "The
math (for the Greek bailout) didn't
add up a year ago, and the math
doesn't add up today," Krosby
said.

Decision took
six weeks amid
political friction
BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) -
Libya's transitional leaders
named a new Cabinet yester-
day and vowed to step down
after the country is secured,
a move designed to show the
North African nation is moving
on even though fighting per-
sists and Moammar Gadhafi
remains at large.
The announcement was
made jointly by the head of the
National Transitional Coun-
cil, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, and
de facto Prime Minister Mah-
moud Jibril in a news con-
ference following weeks of
political infighting and delays
over the formation of a new
government.
In the end, the Cabinet line-
up did not contain many chang-
es, prompting many Libyans to,
question why it took so long,
coming about six weeks after
revolutionary forces seized!
the capital, Tripoli, and forced
Gadhafi into hiding.
Jibril, who graduated from
and taught strategic planning
at the University of Pittsburgh
for several years, remains in his
position but also takes over as
foreign minister, meaning his
current deputy and Foreign
Minister Ali al-Issawi is out.
Ali al-Tarhouni, a U.S.-edu-
cated economist, will continue
acting as oil minister until the
National Oil Company is ready
to take over.
The new leaders said they
would remain in place until

the country is secured and lib-
eration is declared, then a new
transitional government would
be formed within a month.
"We have signed a pledge
to the Libyan people that we
will not be part of the future
government not in any way,"
Abdul-Jalil said to applause.
The pledge was intended to
reassure the public they will not
suffer under another dictator-
ship.
Revolutionary forces are still
battling loyalists of Gadhafi on
two major fronts as well as pock-
ets deep in the southern desert.
But Jibril said he had asked
that liberation be declared after
Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte is
captured because that would
ensure that all sea, land and air
entry ports are secure.
He acknowledged fighting
would continue in Bani Walid,
where the terrain and the har-
boring of suspected high-levt
el -regime figures - possibly
including Gadhafi's son Seif al-
Islam - has led to a weekslong
standoff. But he said it was
important to declare victory
and begin rebuilding the coun-
try.
"Bani Walid doesn't have
any international exits," Jibril
said. "And it is very important
to begin and speed up the tran-
sitional process and begin the
democratic stage."
The NTC has promised to
hold elections eight months
after the end of fighting.
A new minister for Libyans
killed and wounded was also
named. He is Abdel-Rahman al-
Keissah, described as a lawyer
who was wounded in the fight-
ing. Hamza Abu Fas will replace

Sheik Salem al-Sheiki as the
minister of religious affairs.
When asked if members of the
Cabinet might remain in their
posts after liberation, Jibril said
that would be up to the future
leadership and would depend on
their performance.
"We ask Libyans to under-
stand that this is a sensitive and
critical stage," Abdul-Jalil told
reporters in the eastern city of
Benghazi, which was the birth-
place of the revolution.
NATO, meanwhile, expressed
concern about the possibil-
ity that thousands of portable
surface-to-air missiles left over
from Gadhafi's regime are miss-
ing in Libya. NATO airstrikes
played a key role in the rebellion
that ousted Gadhafi.

Protest the pipeline
U.S. shouldn't endorse the Keystone XL project
At a time when jobs are scarce and fuel prices are high, Ameri-
cans are expecting positive action from the government.
With this in mind, many people are putting their support
behind a project involving an oil pipeline that runs from Canada
through the middle of the United States. However, the proposal is a
short-term solution with risks that far outweigh the potential bene-
fits. While the pipeline would create thousands of temporary jobs, the
environmental threat in the event of an incident is a major concern.
The U.S. Department of State should not allow this project to move
forward and should instead focus efforts on investing in renewable
forms of energy.

Engage in meaningful debates *

There have been nationwide protests
against this project, primarily on the basis
of environmental concerns. The Canadian
oil company TransCanada has proposed to
build the oil pipeline from Canada through
Nebraska, Oklahoma and other states down
to Texas. The pipeline would be close to
2,000 miles in length and is expected to
create an estimated 20,000 jobs during the
construction process. Recent reports say the
project will most likely be supported by the
State Department, but it is unclear whether
the department will approve it.
The oil pipeline, called Keystone XL,
would be a politically safe source of oil for
our country. Canada and the U-S. are on
good terms and receiving oil from Canada
would decrease the nation's dependency on
the Organization Of Petroleum Exporting
Countriesi However, the oil pipeline poses a
multitude of environmental threats. While
officials behind the project have stressed
that all safety precautions would be taken,
history has shown that safety precautions
are often insufficient.
For example, a little over a year ago, a pipe-
line constructed by Enbridge Energy spilled
more than 843,000 gallons of oil sands crude
near Marshall, Mich. To this day, a 35-mile

stretchofthe KalamazooRiverremainsclosed.
And no one can forget the horrific BP oil spill
that devastated the Gulf of Mexico last summer
- a disaster which isnstill being corrected.
These risks are not worth the benefit of cre-
ating temporary construction jobs. Many resi-
dents in the pipeline's path want the project to
be approved because it will create jobs, but the
pipeline could threaten the livelihood of farm-
ers in the pipeline's path in the event of a spill.
The creation of jobs should be high on the
Obama administration's priority list, but it
should not come at the expense of the environ-
ment. Rather, the nation should focus on creat-
ing alternative and sustainable forms of energy.
The pursuit of sustainable energy would create
jobs for the scientists and engineers who work
to develop the resources. The goal should be to
create jobs while simultaneously moving away
from petroleum dependency.
Secretary of State Hilary Clinton - likely
with input from Obama - will ultimately
have to decide whether to endorse this proj-
ect, and the people protesting the issue
should make their voices heard. The oil pipe-
line project should not move forward, and
the nation should instead work on developing
alternative forms of energy that can create
jobs for the future.

Anyone who walked through
the Diag yesterday was
subjected to poster-size,
horrifying pic-
tures of dead
fetuses covered
in blood, which
were courtesy
of Students for
Life - the Uni-
versity's pro-life
student orga-
nization - and HARSHA
other organiza- NAHATA
tions. I, for one,
was disgusted at
the images and the entire concept.
I am pro-choice. But regardless of
mypersonal beliefs, myproblemwith
the protestors wasn't their stance,
but how they chose to portray that
stance.
Yes, the Constitution protects
Americans' right to free speech and
to peacefully protest, but it doesn't
require anyone to listen to baseless,
hateful attacks. Comparing abortion
to Nazism and then pasting life-size
pictures of bloody fetuses next to
Nazi symbols is an abuse of this right,
not to mention completely obnoxious.
The main argument here - or
what I could gather amid countless
pictures of convoluted babies - was
that killing unborn fetuses is akin
to genocide, the likes of which were
seen in the Holocaust or Darfur. Not
only is this comparison nonsensical,
but it is also offensive and insult-
ing. The Holocaust, Darfur, Rwanda
- these are examples of genocide.
They are some of the greatest and
most tragic humanitarian crises of
the last century. Millions of people
have been, and are being killed, in the
most painful ways. The Holocaust
alone spanned over 15 countries and
claimed more than 10 million lives -
resigning millions more to torture,
intense human suffering and psycho-
logical trauma.
Abortion simply isn't on the same
scale. It can't be logically likened to

the calculated killing of an entire
ethnic group or to the destruc-
tion of entire communities, villages
and nations. Saying it is the same
as genocide trivializes the sever-
ity and the significance of what we
define as genocide. Concentration
camps, civil war, ethnic cleansing,
poverty, disease, rape, child soldiers,
the destruction of families - every-
thing that comes with genocide is
on a whole different level of human
suffering than that brought on by
abortion. Calling the two similar is
insulting to the victims and survivors
of actual genocide.
Nowadays it seems like Nazism is
a go-to buzzword for angry people to
describe opposition. Putting a swas-
tika next to anything you don't agree
with won't validate your argument
or prove your point. In fact, doing
so does nothing but spread hateful
propaganda. Abortion is a very heat-
ed and politicized issue - dividing
people along intensely partisan lines.
And, in this situation, calling some-
one who disagrees with you Hitler or
an evil incarnate doesn't change his
or her mind. It only makes the issue
more polarizing.
A protest like the one on the Diag
doesn't make a point. It doesn't edu-
cate people or make them see the
issue in a different way. It doesn't
win support for the cause it propa-
gates. It doesn't even substantiate a
legitimate claim. It's a publicity stunt
- an attempt to get the attention of
innocent passersby and in the pro-
cess spread fear and hate.Itisa show
of bigotry and an opportunity to look
down upon and unfairly attack indi-
viduals with opposing views.
The sad thing is that family plan-
ning - or lack thereof - is an actu-
al issue. It is an issue that should
be raised, discussed and debated.
According to the latest statistics from
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 83.7 percent of abortions
were performed among unmarried
women in 2007. A 2009 study by the

non-profit Alan Guttmacher Insti-
tute reported that while the overall
abortion rate in the United States
dropped from 1994 to 2000,the abor-
tion rate for women below the pover-
ty line rose by 25 percent. Moreover,
minorities continue to have dispro-
portionately high abortion rates.
The exhibit in
the Diag didn't
make a point.
There is a larger, underlying
social and economic issue at play
here - the circumstances that com-
pel people totake the drastic step of
aborting a child. This is an issue that
merits rational and intellectual dis-
cussion and an issue that requires
attention and solutions. As one of
the chalked responses to the protest
on the sidewalk read, "Respect the
right; reduce the need." Now, that's
a serious discussion worth having
and one that people shouldn't mind
engaging in.
But this side of the abortion debate
is lost behind absurd slogans and
propaganda. The preposterous claim
that anyone who isn't pro-life is in
effect a murderer oversimplifies the
issue tremendously. It takes awayany
room for debate or discussion and
doesn't do justice to the true com-
plexity of the issue. We can't have
substantial discussions about abor-
tion if this politicized rhetoric con-
tinues to be the norm. If the goal isto
raise awareness about an issue, do so
seriously and with well-structured
arguments, not by likening abortion
to the Holocaust.

Be what you want to be


Focus on relationships

efore heading home last
Thursday night, my friends
and I walked to Cafe Ambro-

As a University student, I am often asked
what I'm studying. You might think it's a sim-
ple question to answer, but I feel otherwise. I
am a classical archeology major, I love what
I'm studying and I have no problem telling
people about it. But here's the scary part. Hav-
ing an unconventional major prompts more
people to follow the first question with anoth-
er - what is my plan for the future?
I come from a family in which almostevery-
one I'm related to (and that's more than 200
people I personally know) is an entrepreneur,
a doctor or an engineer - making my choice
of major highly unconventional. Not follow-
ing the tradition is like asking for disapproval.
And as far as the question of the future is con-
cerned, my answer is that I simply don't know.
There's so much one can do in life, which
makes it hard for me to make up my mind
and choose just one career path. If I decide
to become an archeologist, I'll be in graduate
school two years from now and will almost
definitely be getting a Ph.D. sometime down
the line. But is that really all I wantto be?
Before declaring a classical archeology
major, I spoke to an adviser at the Univer-
sity and told him that I had always dreamed
of becoming an archeologist. What I didn't
tell him is that as a kid I had also dreamed of
becoming a photographer, a journalist, a doc-
tor, a historian, a psychiatrist and a lawyer.
Now surely these were childish musings, as
everyone around me thought, but as I grew
older I became more and more fascinated by
all there was I could do. I'm still not sure what
I want to do after graduation, and that's start-
ing to get a bit scary now that I've entered my
junior year.

Whether I'm really going to end up becom-
ing an archeologist - I don't know. But here's
what I do know. If I hadn't explored different
opportunities at the University, I probably
wouldn't have renewed or even discovered my
passion for a lot of things. At the University, I
can actually be many of the things I dreamed
of becoming. Only here can I be defined by
much more than what I'm studying. I can
be a dancer in a group, a photographer for a
newspaper, a member of Greek life, part of a
charitable organization and even an athlete
- though all that at the same time might be a
little overwhelming if I want to maintain my
grades. Four years, however, is enough time
for students to explore at least some of what
the University has to offer. And everyone
should.
Today, in a world where more and more
of youth are looking to enter unconventional
careers, like teaching yoga, there are no lim-
itations to what a person can do for a living.
A college degree, some argue, does not hold
much value anymore in this volatile econo-
my. But there is nothing that can discredit
or replace the overall University experience,
which is priceless. The University admitted
only about 50 percent of its applicants last
year, a trend that it seems to have followed
over the years. Students should take advan-
tage of the more than 1,200 student organiza-
tions, 300 majors and about 3,000 courses that
are offered. Explore all you want; and take at
least these four years to be not what youshould
be, but whatever it is you want to be.

the coffee shop
turned out to
be closed. With
nothing else to
do, the four of us
leaned with our

GREEN

backs against the window, ready to
part ways. But then, a curious scene
unfolded before us. Two-by-two,
stumbling couples walked past, evi-
dently coming from Skeeps, the bar
just a few yards down the street.
While many of them might have
been Jewish, let's just say it didn't
seem like they were going home to
celebrate Rosh Hashanah.
Many ofthese coupleswere clearly
just meeting for the first time - mak-
ing awkward small talk about the
frigid weather and discussing what
summer camps they went to. Admit-
tedly, my friends and I were witness-
ing only a sliver of campus life, but
the sight was illustrative of a grander
theme - and a significant issue - at
the University.
It's not a groundbreaking obser-
vation that random hookups are
commonplace on this campus.
Many students accept meaningless
hookups as the rule, with relation-
ships as the exception. And by now,
plenty of articles, essays and sorority
house dining hall conversations have
acknowledged and lamented this
fact. For whatever reason, college
students - and I'll admit, it's an over-
whelmingly male inclination - seem
averse to asking one another out on
dates or actually building meaning-

ful, romantic relationships.
A friend who graduated last year
recently told me that within just a
few months of post-graduate life,
she'd gone on more dates than she
had during her entire time at col-
lege. So is it possible that this trend
is just a college craze that will fade
with age?
Of course. But I'm not willing to
accept the cliches that boys will be
boys or that this, too, shall pass. As
"normal" as this trend seems to us,
it's clearly not constructive. Our col-
lege years are far too formative for us
to blithely accept unhealthy behav-
ior now in sight of healthier conduct
down the road. Young adulthood can
be tremendously lonely as we teeter
between our adolescent lives and
whatever "real" futures we expect
to come in adulthood. And random
hookups only exacerbate this emo-
tional solitude.
The conventional wisdom is that
guys promote this hookup culture
because they won't commit and that
girls just let it happen. But in defense
of my gender, I know plenty of men
on campus who'd gladly forego the
weekendhookup ritualforsomething
a little less fleeting, if only the oppor-
tunity arose. Though it's tempting,
I think it'd be a mistake to pin the
blame squarely on men. If it were so
simple a dynamic between males and
females, then the hookup crisis, as it
perhaps ought to be known, would
not exist in homosexual circles. But I
know plenty of gay men and lesbians
who play into the exact same routine
largely because they feel they don't
have any alternative. The reality is
that anyone who feels slighted by
the dating paradigm - heterosexual
girls in the mainstream imagination,
but also guys, and gays and straights
alike - probably has contributed to
their own predicament by allowing
others to call the shots. If a woman,

for instance, wants to regain con-
trol of the scenario, then she needs
to be less willing to give in to men's
advances from the start.
Random hookups
worsen emotional
solitude.
This advice has certainly been
given before. And it's taken on a small
scale all the time. But the problem
with this is that one voice alone is
not enough to enact systemic change.
What we need is a mass grassroots
initiative to replace the hookup cul-
ture with a dating culture or at least a
culture of respect. En masse, women
need to withhold themselves from
guys insistent on one-night-stands
or purely physicalrelationships, until
said guys start realizing they need
to stop taking women for granted. I
know plenty of girls who have done
this already but only to personal
ends. If all women on campus took
this stand, men would have no choice
but to take heed.
I know this may appear frivolous,
and I may sound alarmist, but the
hookup culture is getting out of hand.
And though we have activists at the
University engaged in innumerable
social debates, this issue remains
untouched by any serious move-
ment or protest. It's time to channel
the University's activist heritage and
take a stand in unison. Because taken
alone, our attempts mean little. But
together, we can do it. or not do it, as
the case may be.

Bitter and sweet in '50 50'
Gordon-Levitt and Rogen lend
humor and pathos to cancer film
By Akshay Seth I For the Daily

Don't criticize
ambition

Comedy-dramas have been
called many things in the past,
usually ranging somewhere
between unwatchable B.S. and
average/forget-
table. Well, my ****
cynical friends,
that's about to 50/50
change because
"50/50," the At Qualityl6
latest dram- and Rave
edy by Jonathan Summit
Levine ("The
Wackness") is
bold, unexpected and thoroughly
uplifting.
For one thing, it's a comedy
that goes where you wouldn't
expect it to. In a world where
the average American male,
diagnosed with cancer, has no
guarantee of surviving the next
five years, "50/50" offers a light-
hearted and humorous take on
dealing with a very real and
deadly disease. Surprisingly, the
result is a heartwarming tale of
friendship that finds one way to
accurately reveal the psyche of a
20-something forced to deal with
the notion of mortality.
The script, loosely based on the
true story of writer Will Reiser
(TV's "Da Ali G Show") starts off
in an expected fashion, giving us a

taste of how normality defines the
everyday life of protagonist Adam
Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
"Inception") and his obnoxious
yet loveable best friend Kyle (Seth
Rogen, "The Green Hornet").
Eventually, Adam notices a per-
sistent pain in his back and visits
the doctor, where he learns of the
rare spinal tumor concentrated
in the lower half of his back. The
name of the film is a reference to
the 50-percent survival rate asso-
ciated with this form of cancer.
As Adam proceeds with the
typically morose battery of
treatments - chemotherapy,
cancer-counseling and a weekly
cancer support group meeting -
the movie's humorous tones begin
to shine through. Instead of the
characteristically weepy atmo-
sphere you would expect after the
initial burst of shock, the script
opts for a lull in emotion that falls
in line with Adam's slightly awk-

ligent choice on the writer's part,
because the generally calm and
collected nature of the writing

ing advantage of Adam's illness
to get girls and procure medical
marijuana - all the more amus-
ing.
But what really sets this film
apart and puts it a few cuts above
the everyday comedy-drama is
that the acting affords it legiti-
mate emotional weight. By the
beginning of the third act, all
of the characters have been laid
out so completely that the audi-
ence starts to genuinely care
for them. We don't roll our eyes
when Adam begins to question
the significance of his existence or
when Kyle, the guy who suggest-
ed chucking knives at a painting
made by Adam's manipulative ex,
shows a more pensive and caring
side. Even Adam's psychiatrist,

played wonderfully by Anna Ken-
drick ("Up in the Air") as tentative
and awkward, attracts sympathy
from the audience.
At the end of the day, "50/50"
is a showcase of how good direct-
ing, good writing and really good
acting allow a movie to fulfill its
purpose. In this case, that pur-
pose doesn't just entail putting
Rogen in front of a camera to spew
profanity and smoke pot (even
though he does a little of both). No
matter how cheesy it may sound,
this film shows us why keeping
our heads up and pointing for-
ward can define the way we deal
with our problems. If you choose
to see for yourself, expect plenty
of laughs, some tears and one hell
of a good movie.

' > _ ^
:

wo recent films strike
me as especially impor-
tant in the current
cinematic landscape. The first
is Terrence Malick's "The Tree
of Life,"
which, after
its release in
May, quickly
became
one of the
most talked
about and
contentious PHILIP
movies in CONKLIN
years. After a
particularly
controversial Palme d'Or win at
Cannes - the most prestigious
prize at arguably the most pres-
tigious film festival in the world
- the film went on to create a
gaping rift in critical and pub-
lic opinion, abhorrence or awe
seemingly the only responses
to this either pretentious or
ground-breaking film.
The other is Miranda July's
"The Future," which, though
a much lower-profile film, is
equally meaningful. The film
has not garnered acclaim or
hatred on the scale of "The Tree
of Life," but it too has provoked
strong and disparate critical
reactions.
The two films, on the surface,
appear different to the point of
being antithetical: "The Future"
is an indie dramedy about a
young, hip couple adrift in Los
Angeles. "The Tree of Life" is a
sweeping, dead-serious drama
about a family in rural Texas
in the 1950s. But beneath these
broad narrative strokes, the films
are strikingly similar. Each col-
ors its benign, even banal, prem-
ise with supernatural elements
to explore profound questions
about human nature and the-
meaning of life.
This brings us to the most sig-
nificant similarity between these
two films, and what makes them
important: They are ambitious.
These are not just films that tell
a compellingcstory about their
characters, though they each
do that. They are films of broad
scope that, like all great art,
have something to say about life,
something important to tell the
audience. And whether you think
they succeed or not (I happen
to think they both do), it is the
attempt that defines ambition.
And it seems ambitious films
are sorely needed in the cur-
rent movie climate, in which
the trend is moving rapidly and
lamentably away from ambition.
Franchises abound in Holly-
wood, with the Avengers series
("Thor," "Captain America,"
"Iron Man"), "Pirates of the
Caribbean" (the series's fifth film
is set to be released in 2013) and
many others. Now couple that
with the recent rash of remakes
- "Conan the Barbarian,"
"Fright Night" and "Straw Dogs"
to name a few - not to mention
Disney's shameless money-grub-
bing in the form of the re-release
of "The Lion King" in 3-D.
In other words, the movie
industry lacks even the ambition
to come up with an original idea.
Instead, studios rehash the same
already-tired material over and
over again, or dredge the annals

of film history in search of a not-

quite-forgotten idea to be resold
to the next generation.
In the face of such barefaced
avarice, films like "The Future"
and "The Tree of Life" should, it
seems, be heralded as the saviors
of cinema. Instead, though the
critical response to both films
was generally positive, audi-
ences and critics alike seemed
to be threatened by these films.
Even critics who liked the films
were sometimes put off by the
bizarreness of "The Future" and
the supposed pretentiousness of
"The Tree of Life."
But the films are not overly
bizarre, nor pretentious; they
are ambitious. Sure, "The
Future" is bizarre - in it, the
moon talks, a T-shirt comes to
life and time stops - but July
uses these strange elements
to express ideas about life and
the human condition, big ideas
that could not adequately be
expressed in conventional ways.
And sure, "The Tree of Life"
seems pretentious - it depicts
the formation of the universe -
but why should a film not have
lofty aspirations?
What is art if
not innovation?
'Pirates of the
Caribbean' five.
Some detractors also com-
plained that the deliberate
pace of "The Tree of Life" was
alienating. But the film is slow
because Malick had the courage
to compose frames that stand
alone;,that each tell their own
story, and to linger on these
images is necessary. And the rea-
son the film is nearly plotless and
is told in voice-over is because
the story is lyrical, rather than
linear - the viewer's reactions,
rather than the action on screen,
is what forms the narrative.
Malick is pushing the boundar-
ies of the medium, attempting
to expand the capabilities of
cinema.
Certainly these films are con-
fusing and can be intimidating
for viewers, but they should not
be disregarded as pretentious or
too strange because they aspire
to do more than entertain. They
should be lauded.
This is not to say that films
should not be entertaining. Of
course films should entertain,
and if they fail to do so they
are unsuccessful ina way. But
regardless of a film's ability to
entertain, if it aims to do noth-
ing other than divert its audi-
ence for 90 minutes, then its
existence is superfluous. But if
a film aspires to be considered
art, if it is challenging enough to
provoke thought and debate, it
has succeeded as more than just
a diversion. "The Tree of Life"
and "The Future" are two films
that do this, and other filmmak-
ers should be ambitious enough
to follow suit.

Feist's album seems to have

While perhaps self-indulgent, her
songs are certainly less likely to
glitter and fizzle out like "1234"
did. In an interview with Agence

Metals is meant to be a timeless
and more malleable album.
"I tried to plant the possibility
for it to adapt with me," she said.
"I tried to be really responsible
for the fact I know I'm goingto be
singing these songs for the rest of
my life."
But while Feist may be singing
these songs for the rest of her life,
the rest of us are left with a vague
recollection of semi-melodic
digressions and ecological meta-
phors.

In its third season, 'Glee' loses the fun to become a cash machine

By MACKENZIE METER
DailyArts Writer
When "Glee" was a brand-new
show, an infant in the world of
primetime television, it was fresh.
It was fun. But
most of all, it
wasn't the over-
the-top show Glee
it has become.

lacks that particular magic that
propelled it to the top of the rat-

has become the annoying11-year-
old boy with a mop top who
thinks he can get away with any-
thing - everyone in the room just
tunes him out and silently prays
that he grows out of his awkward
phase soon.
"Glee" has potential. There are
two great numbers in the sea-
son premiere - one is a fabulous
mash-up of "Anything Goes" and
"Anything You Can Do" and the
other is the ever-stirring, ever-
inspiring "You Can't Stop the
Beat." These two songs comprise
the only worthwhile moments
through the show's 45-minute
duration. The mash-up is per-
formed by non-Glee Club mem-

bers and features the lovely
Lindsay Pearce ("The Glee Proj-

the last song in the show. If a little
heavy-handed, it's an extremely

by the members of New Direc-

zation's exhibits because there
are fewer children present.
While some students expressed
concern regarding the graphic
nature of the exhibit's photos,
Hardwick said the shock value of
the photos is justified.
"The only reason our display
is so graphic is because abortion
is so graphic," Hardwick said.
"If you don't like these pictures,
then maybe you shouldn't like
abortion."
LSA junior Carmen Allen,
president of Students for Life,
said the organization asked the
Genocide Awareness Project to
come to campus because many
students here aren't concerned
about abortions.
"I think that the University of
Michigan is the subject of a lot of
apathy on campus that we have
labeled tolerance," Allen said.
"I think that abortion is an issue
that has really fallen under that
apathy. The only thing that can

really shake up this campus is to
see what's going on through the
graphic image."
Allen said she didn't think
the pictures are unnecessarily
graphic.
"This is exactly what's hap-
pening," she said. "I think that
we have the right to our consti-
tutional freedom of speech ... It's
important for people to be aware
of what's going on."
LSA junior Anna Paone, vice
president of Students for Life,
said she was initially concerned
about the graphic nature of the
photos that the organization
brought to campus.
"At first I didn't agree," Paone
said. "At first I thought this was
too bold, and I thought it would
offend too many people to be
useful."
But she said she has since
decided that the images are
necessary to challenge people's
opinions about abortion.
"I think that sometimes you
need to go bold, and you need to
have images," Paone said.
She added that she thinks the

exhibit makes an accurate com-
parison of abortion to genocide.
"Our fundamental argument
is that the fetus is a human,"
Paone said. "If the fetus is a
human, it is an accurate com-
parison."
Students for Life contact-
ed the Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform and brought its members
to campus for a similar event in
2000, according to Paone. The
campus group also had a booth
on the Diag yesterday dispens-
ing information for women who
may be considering abortion and
set up a "Free Speech" board on
which students could write their
opinions about various issues.
LSA senior Rachel Fentin, co-
president of Students for Choice,
said the campus organization
tried to prevent the Genocide
Awareness Project from coming
to the University.
"We had concern for the stu-
dents on campus who are going
to be walking through that have
experienced abortion, who have
family members that have had
abortions or (had) family mem-

bers that were in the Holocaust,"
Fentin said in an interview on
the Diag.
She added that students rep-
resenting Students for Choice
gathered the Diag to oppose the
exhibit.
"It's their freedom of speech,
so we're exercising our right to
free speech and reminding peo-
ple that there is an alternative
narrative to this," said Fentin,
who added that the Genocide
Awareness Project was using
"scare tactics."
LSA freshman Annie Bauer-
Levey said the photos repulsed
her and are too graphic for stu-
dents walking through the Diag.
"I think it's ridiculous that
they're comparing abortion to
genocide," Bauer-Levey said.
Engineering freshman Reed
Lillie described the exhibit as
"shocking" but said he under-
stands the group's use of the
images.
"It gets the point across that
they're trying to make that abor-
tion isn't a pretty thing," Lillie
said.

and her doctorate in biochemistry
from the University of North Car-
olina. For 19 years, Coleman was a
member of the biochemistry fac-
ulty at the University ofKentucky.
The environment of academia
has changed to better foster
innovation and guard individual
rights to intellectual property
since Coleman received her Ph.D.
in 1969, she said. The biggest
change, Coleman said, has been
the emphasis on entrepreneur-
ship in the last five years.
"I do think that (the Univer-
sity) is in many ways at the fore-
front with many institutions of
putting incentives in place, cre-
ating opportunities, doing things
that are really going to spur this
kind of activity," Coleman said.
Elizabeth Barry, managing
director of the Life Sciences Insti-
tute, said she and David Canter,
executive director of the North
Campus Research Complex,
thought for14n-an as aguestlec-
turer while planning the course,
which is cross-listed in the Medi-

cal School, College of Engineer-
ing, Ross School of Business and
Ford School of Public Policy.
Coleman's oratory skills and her
background in science made her
an obvious choice, Barry said.
"We were trying to think of
who was someone who really was
at the intersection of a lot of the
kinds of themes we talked about
in this class," Barry said.
Coleman currently serves as
co-chair of the National Advisory
Council on Innovation and Entre-
preneurship and is a member of
the board for the pharmaceutical
company Johnson & Johnson.
In her lecture, Coleman said
being on the board of Johnson &
Johnson has been an "interest-
ing experience." She said she has
learned about the difficulties
companies face from the Food
and Drug Administration and
health care reform, among other
challenges.
"Groups get in the way," Cole-
man said. "Everybody's trying to
do the right thing."
Coleman said her experience
givesher aunique license to speak
at cross-disciplinary lectures like
this one, but noted that science

moves at a pace that is difficult to
keep up with.
"I'd have to go back to grad
school to be a scientist today,"
Coleman said.
Engineering graduate student
Zubair Ahsan asked Coleman
how the University is bringing
research into industry. Coleman
answered that it is hard to pre-
dict what lines of research will be
viable in industry.
"Some of the biggest discover-
ies that have ever been made came
completely serendipitously," Cole-
man said.
However, Coleman said the
University uses Tech Transfer -
an office that helps put technolo-
gy developed at the University on
the market - to accelerate busi-
ness endeavors and protect the
intellectual property of students
and faculty. In fiscal year 2011, an
all-time high of 101 technologies
that went through Tech Trans-
fer were licensed and optioned,
according to a press release issued
yesterday.
"We have a support system
within the University that is a lot
more robust even than it was five
years ago," Coleman said.

Coleman said she understands
the challenges faculty and stu-
dents face when trying to find
funding for and continue their
research at the University.
"Ninety-five percent of the
time, you're depressed because
your experiment didn't work out
like you think it should, and so
it's failure, failure, failure," Cole-
man said, adding that the other
five percent of the time gives
researchers the motivation to
move forward.
In an interview after the lec-
ture, Ahsan said he was satisfied
with Coleman's responses and is
looking forward to hearing more
specifics in her State of the Uni-
versity address tomorrow. He
added that multi-disciplinary
courses like The Business of Biol-
ogy are valuable because they
allow students to hear from influ-
ential people like Coleman each
week.
"(Barry and Canter) have done
a good job in selecting the speak-
ers with the appropriate back-
grounds that hit every aspect of
the business of biology," Ahsan
said. "Whether it be regulatory,
entrepreneurial, university, etc."

ulty, and dependent children of
qualified adults would be put at
a disadvantage.
SACUA members expressed
mixed views on the proposed
resolution.
Finn Larsen, an associate
professor of physics and associ-
ate chair of the Department of
Physics, questioned whether
SACUA should be addressing the
issue since the University oper-
ates according to bylaws passed
by the regents. The University
is one of several public institu-
tions in the state that are exempt
from certain state laws since
they have their own governing
bodies.
"Is this any of their business
to tell us what to do?" Larsen
said. "And of course, if it's not,
then it might not be our business
to tell them what to do outside
this university."
SACUA Chair Kate Barald, a
professor in the Medical School
and College of Engineering, said
the University's stance on the
proposed bill would have con-
sequences for many institutions.
"I think we're perfectly justi-
fied in dealing with this issue,"
Barald said. "I think there's a
bigger issue here. I think this
has a wider and bigger context in
that yes, we should certainly be
concerned aboutthe University's
context, but I personally think it
has a broader implication."
In an interview after the
meeting, SACUA Vice Chair
Kimberlee Kearfott, a profes-
sor in the College of Engineer-
ing and Medical School, said

REZONING OF MEDICAL
POT DISPENSARY
PROPERTY DENIED
In an 8-3 vote, the Ann Arbor-
Sqty touncil rejected a request
last night to rezone a property -
that houses a medical marijuana
dispensary - on South State
Street from an office district to a
local business district so that the
dispensary can legally operate
as a business.
Attorney Dennis Hayes, who
spoke during the public com-
mentary, said Treecity Health
Collective - located at 1712
South State St. - has been work-
ing diligently to get the property
rezoned. He expressed his dis-
satisfaction with the city and
commented on the difficulty of
establishing medical marijuana
dispensaries in the city.

"You get to be a re-founding
father," Haddad said. "The new
reputation is what you make of
it."

Still, it will take some time
before Acacia becomes a fully
recognized fraternity chapter
at the University. Acacia needs
to recruit at least 10 pledges
this year to continue to become
an official chapter, but Haddad
hopes the fraternity will attract
about 30 new pledges.
Acacia is currently consid-
ered an expansion chapter. It
takes new chapters between
two to four years to become full
members of the IFC, according
to LSA junior Sean Jackson,
IFC vice president of public
relations.
Each year, the IFC invites
national fraternities that don't
have chapters at the University

if fringe benefits were taken
away from University faculty
in domestic partnerships, many
domestic partners and their
children would be negatively
affected and the University
would no longer attract the best
faculty members.
"We could lose faculty who
would go elsewhere because
their benefits for their partners
would be compromised, and we
wouldn't be able to maintain a
recruiting advantage," Kearfott
said. "To be the Leaders and the
Best, we need the leaders and
the best. We need the best ben-
efits for everybody. It's only fair."
Engineering and Physics Prof.
Rachel Goldman suggested an
amendment to a statement in the
resolution she felt was too defen-
sive. It said the University's
current policy is effective and
described the negative effects
that taking away fringe benefits
would have for faculty.
SaraAhbel-Rappe, a professor
of Greek and Latin and a guest
speaker at the meeting, said the
state Senate will vote on the
bill by the end of the month and
thinks the Republican majority
will pass the bill successfully.
She said she hopes SACUAs pro-
posed resolution will allow fac-
ulty members to give their input.
"The bill is just moving
through the legislature," Ahbel-
Rappe said. "It's moving with-
out any opposition, and it's also
moving without any public con-
versation. So the idea would be
to give faculty a voice."
Kearfott said a revised reso-
lution will likely be drawn up at
an upcoming Senate Assembly
meeting, where faculty members
will further discuss the issue.

Hayes said.
City Council member Sandi
Smith (D-Ward 1), who voted for
the rezoning, said she felt con-

since there are businesses and
retail spaces in the surrounding
area and pointed out the growth
of aproduce stat~6r nerby.
"I do see that here is an oppor-
tunity with changing conditions
in that area," Smith said.
City Planning Manager
Wendy Rampson said the
request - which the council
postponed from its Sept. 19
meeting - did not have enough
justification to be accepted due
to the presence of office spaces
in the area.
"In this particular situa-
tion ... we saw that it was such a
small piece of land surrounded
by other uses - office uses and
industrial across the street -
that to take one piece out of con-

said.
"The (fraternity) has to put

Acacia aims to hinge its

reputation around service and
education, Psyk and Haddad
said. They added that the bond
Acacia brothers have with one
another goes beyond their four
years together on campus.
Haddad said Acacia offers a
membership development pro-
gram that facilitates connec-
tions with alumni and other
fraternity members across the
country. Acacia brothers are

The Michigan hockey team

by forward Nicolas Kerdiles,

And for a while, the game was
an even matchup between the
young high school players and
the more experienced Wolver-

But Michigan quickly dashed
any hopes of an upset when
junior forward Lindsay Sparks
capitalized on a scrum around
the net eight minutes later. After
that, the Wolverines refused to
give up possession.
Michigan kept the puck in
the USNTDP's attack zone for

sophomore forward Luke Mof-

FOOTBALLA
Two-quarterback package
paying dividends for Blue

MICHAELFLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Junior running back Vincent
Smith says the Michigan foot-
ball team calls the formation
'Two,' for the two quarterbacks
involved. The
Wolverines can NOTEBOOK
call it whatever
they want - opposing defensive
coordinators will likely just call
it scary.
The formation consists of
sophomore quarterback Devin
Gardner lined up under center
with junior quarterback Denard
Robinson lined up a few yards
back, off center. Two running
backs fill in the rest of the back-
field to make a diamond.
The 12th-ranked Wolver-
ines used the formation spar-
ingly throughout the game, but
to great effect. Once, Robinson
tookahandoffand ranthe option.
Anothertime, Robinsoncuttothe
right, while redshirt sophomore
Fitz Toussaint took a pitch to the
left. Perhaps the most interesting

play came when Gardner hand-
ed off to Robinson, who threw
the ball back to Gardner behind
the line of scrimmage. Gardner
looked to throw down field but
couldn't find anybody open, so he
scrambled.
"I wouldn't know what to do
with that," said fifth-year senior
defensive tackle Ryan Van Ber-
gen. "It looked like the Mad
Magicians (Michigan's 1947
national championship team), it
was ridiculous. I hadn't seen any
of those plays either.
"I know they were repping
them with the scout team but
they never showed them to us as
ones. We were excited when they
showed us the formation, we just
didn't know what was coming."
Obviously, the coaches did.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
use of the package depends on the
flow of the game, and even though
the formation was unveiled on
the second play Saturday, there
already "was good flow." Maybe
that flow started in the hotel
before the game. Senior tight end

Kevin Koger said the coaching
staff told the offense what the
first three plays of the game were
going to be.
Unveiling the package gives
teams time to prepare for the
counter plays, double passes and
option runs that Michigan (1-0
Big Ten, 5-0 overall) showed
against Minnesota. But defens-
es can't prepare for what they
haven't seen.
"We haven't done anything
with that yet," Robinson said.
"It's going to be kind of fun when
we do."
YOU (ROAD) TRIPPIN': When
the Michigan football team plays
Northwestern in Evanston on
Saturday, Hoke won't exactly be
on the road again. Nearly half-
way through his first year as head
coach, Hoke hasn't taken the
Wolverines on the road yet. And
even though the team stays at the
Campus Inn in Ann Arbor the
night before home games, this
will be a little different.

Michigan coach Brady Hoke has the Wolverines ranked 12th in the country after starting the season 5-0.
Hoke says his, teamis 'overrated

STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
On Oct. 4, 2010, the Michigan
football team was 5-0 and drasti-
cally over-ranked at No. 18 in the
nation. Today, the Wolverines
are 5-0 at No. 12 in the Associ-
ated Press poll and No. 11 in the
coaches' poll. One voter, Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke, thinks
they're overrated.
"We're not playing well
enough," Hoke said Monday, two

days after Michigan steamrolled
Minnesota, 58-0. "We're not fin-
ishing well enough."
The No. 12 rank is Michigan's
highest since the fifth-ranked
Wolverines were felled by Appa-
lachian State on Sept. 1,2007.
Hoke admitted, for the first
time this year, that he ranked
Michigan in the coaches' poll.
Howhigh?
"Somewhere in the top-25
teams."
Rest assured he didn't vote

for, No. 11, on the doorstep of the
nation's top-10.
While the team's expectations
have been sky-high since Hoke
arrived in January, players aren't
buying into Michigan's bloated
position inthe polls.
"As far as the ranking goes,
my opinion hasn't changed, the
team's opinion hasn't changed
- ranking doesn't mean any-
thing to us," said fifth-year
senior defensive tackle Ryan

His teaching colleagues
thought of him highly, too. For-
mer Michigan Kinesiology pro-
fessor Rod Grambeau spoke
of his time working alongside
Loken in the Kinesiology depart-
ment.
"He was always very encour-
aging, no matter what you did,"
Grambeau said. "He was always
positive. He never said a negative
word about anyone in all the days
that I knew him."
On the eve of the Michigan-
Minnesota football game, alum-

ni of Loken's alma mater were in
town with his Michigan friends.
They all gathered at the sta-
dium club, high above an empty
Michigan Stadium, where just a
day later the two teams would
face off for the right to claim the
Little Brown Jug.
Those in attendance took
turns sharing memories, sto-
ries and anecdotes not about
Newt Loken the coach, but Newt
Loken the man.
Former Athletic Director Jack
Weidenbach, current Athletic
Director Dave Brandon, former
football coach Gary Moeller and
dozens of others were in atten-
dance.

He will be further honored
during the football game against
Purdue.
The entire women's and men's
gymnastics teams attended to pay
their respects to a man who built
the program they work for every
day.
Minnesota men's gymnastics
coach Mike Burns spoke of the
legacy Newt left behind in his
time as an athlete in Minneapo-
lis. During his time at Michigan,
Newt also coached the cheer-
leading team, and his former
Minnesota teammates helped to
establish the Newt Loken Cheer-
leader's Scholarship, which is
now annually awarded to a Uni-

versityof Michigan cheerleader.
"Newt would never boo any-
thing." Hearst said. "Never cheer
a penalty. Always cheer for, never
against."
In his 36 years as head coach,
Loken led his teams to 12 Big Ten
Championships.
Even after retiring in 1983, his
work was not done. He continued
to play an active role in a program
that he worked so hard to create.
He never missed a home meet,
and even for away meets he was
there, supporting Michigan gym-
nastics throughout his whole life.
His coaching didn't end when
his career did, and neither has his
legacy.

many questions in the open-
ing five games, Michigan hasn't,
yet answered one big question
whether it can perform on a
rad trip.
IJ don't know if it's different
or not," Hoke said. "We'll find
out just the demeanor that we
travel with. ... They're out of
the security of the Campus Inn.
There's a lot of familiarity there
with alot of the guys, especially
with the guys who have played
a lot of football here. There's
a lot of distractions out there

verines into a road atmosphere
before playing Michigan State
in Spartan Stadium the follow-
ing week. With a large Michigan
alumni base in Chicago, many of
the fans at Ryan Field will be
sporting maize and blue any-
way.
But whenever the Wolverines
face a hostile crowd that pro-
duces a lot of noise, there won't
be much adjustment needed on
offense.
"We've never really had a
problem in that part of it," Hoke
said. "it hasn't been previously,
and (offensive cooidinator) Al
(Borges), he doesn't do a lot
with it. We've got silent counts
and everything else that we
already use so it's not s big as
an issue."

INJURY NOTES: The biggest
name left off the dress list last
Saturday was redshirt junior
left guard Ricky Barnum, whose
leg was rolled up on during the
San Diego State game.
On Monday, his status for
Northwestern was still uncer-
tain.
"it will kind of be a daily
deal," Hoke said.
Redshirt sophomore line-
backer Cam Gordon, who hasn't
played this season due to a back
injury, dressed on Saturday but
didn't play.
Hoke was concerned with his
conditioning in previous weeks,
but redshirt freshman Jake
Ryan has taken over Gordon's
starting spot and has played
well.

Van Bergen. "If anything, it just
provides motivation for the team
playing against us.
"We don't think we've played
to the potential we need to yet.
We don't think we've played to
the potential of the No. 12 team
in the country. Can we be there?
Possibly, but we still have to puta.
couple different things in order."
Hoke said he has left it up to
the seniors to keep tabs on young-
er players and temper excitement
over the team's ranking.
"We're not the No. 12 team in
the country," Van Bergen said.
"In our opinion, we are overrated.
"We've played five games,

we've won five games. But, are
we a top-15 team in the country?
I don't think we've played like
that."
Plenty of things have certainly
gone in the Wolverines' favor
through five games this season.
Michigan hasn't played a ranked
team yet and it hasn't left the
friendly confines of Michigan
Stadium.
The Wolverines travel to Evan-
ston to take on Northwestern this
Saturday in a night game at Ryan
Field. The players are aware of
the target on their backs as a
result of the high national rank-
ing.
"Everybody in the locker room
knows we've got to do way more
work than we have done," said
junior quarterback Denard Rob-

inson. "We didn't play a perfect
game this weekend, so we got to
keep comingto work."
But the polls aren't the only
charts Michigan is climbing. In
part, the ranking is thanks to the
defense, which has allowed just
10 points in the past three games.
The Wolverines are second in the
nation in scoring defense, allow=
ing 10.2 points per game.
But Hoke insisted that those
rankings, as well as the national
team ranking, don't matter.
For Hoke, it's business time -
he won't let the team forget that.
"I'm not telling you anything I
didn't tell them yesterday," Hdke
said. "We're not playing the foot-
ball we need to play.
"We've played five games, and
we signed up for 12, guaranteed."
