Year after probe,
DPS Oversight
Cmte. appears
to follow statute

Student, faculty reps
now elected, body
meets more regularly
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
Members of the University's
Department of Public Safety Over-
sight Committee are now being
properly elected, more than one
year after a Michigan Daily inves-
tigation found representatives on
the advisory board were being
elected illegally.
The committee - which is com-
prised -of two faculty, two staff
members and two students -
addresses grievances filed against
the University's Department of
Public Safety. Last November,
independent lawyers told the Daily
that representatives on the com-
mittee were not being elected in
accordance with Michigan statute
Public Act 120.
The law states that faculty, staff
and student representatives must
be elected by their respective
constituencies. At the University,
however, the Michigan Student
Assembly had historically appoint-
ed the two student representa-
tives. In addition, the committee's
bylaws state that faculty members
must be elected every two years,
but at the time of the investigation
the faculty members on the com-
mittee had held their positions for

nine consecutive years.
After a series of reports, MSA
and the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs - the
leading faculty governing body
- revised their respective elec-
tion processes to comply with the
statute.
In February, faculty members
were allowed to nominate their
colleagues to the committee and
then subsequently vote in a fac-
ulty-wide election. The following
month, the student body elected
its two student representatives on
the committee for the first time in
more than a decade.
Law School Prof. Richard Fried-
man, an Alene and Allan F. Smith
Professor of Law, is one of the new
faculty members who was elect-
ed to the committee last spring.
Friedman, an expert in Supreme
Court history, said he didn't active-
ly campaign for the position but
was nominated by his peers.
"I don't know if I particularly
wanted it ... I was asked to serve,
and so I like to say yes when Ican,"
he said.
Friedman, who was selected to
be chair of the committee in July,
is working to ensure that the com-
mittee complies with the state stat-
ute and carries out its role to act as
a check on the campus police.
"The statute could be open to
interpretation to what the precise
function of what the committee is,
but I think it makes it very clear

Rodriguez sat uncomfortably in
his press conference after the
Wolverines' seventh straightloss
to Ohio State - this time a 37-7
shellacking - that debate had
finally reached its breaking point.
So there he sat, on edge like
we'd never seen him before, furi-
ously insisting that he could do
what he's been saying he would
do for three years.
"I took this job to make us the
best program in America, and
sometimes it takes a little longer
to mold the program the way you
want to mold it," Rodriguez said.

"That doesn't mean you can't do
it. Im not deterred one bit.
"I think the worst is behind us.
I know it is."
But after an utter embarrass-
ment like Saturday - which, he's
right, was the worst of his tenure
- that plea doesn't mean quite
as much as it did after his slew of
previous disappointments.
Since his hiring, since 3-9,
since 5-7,I have remained firmly
in Rodriguez's camp. The cup-
board had been bare, injuries had

owners. .
Though some local party store
owners have noticed only modest
increases in sales of the drink nick-
named "blackout in a can," many
report dramatic spikes - with
some stores like A & L Wine Castle
on West Stadium Boulevard seeing
a five-fold increase compared to
sales before the announcement of
the ban. Store owners attribute the
uptick in sales to students stock-
ing up on the drink before it disap-
pears from store shelves.
The beverage, which has been

reported to have adverse side
effects on consumers, contains as
much alcohol as four beers and the
same amount of caffeine found in
three to four cups of coffee.
David Breher, manager of the
Main Street Party Store on North

experienced a 20-percent increase
in Four Loko sales since the ban.

Razor blades mailed to prof. as threat

The Justice Department
of UCLA, an anti-animal
research extremist group, is
suspected of sending multi-
ple threats to David Jentsch,
a University of California,
Los Angeles neuroscientist
and researcher, including
a package filled with razor
blades allegedly contami-
nated with AIDS, according
to a Nov. 24 article in The
Huffington Post.
Police say that they are
investigating the group,
which criticized Jentsch
for injecting addicting
drugs into primates for his
research on tobacco addic-
tion, according tothe report.
A note sent to Jentsch
read, "How would Jentsch
like the same thing he does
to primates to be done to
him? That would be justice.

AFTER $500 FEE,
STUDENTS DROP OUT
OF HONORS PROGRAM
Enrollment in the Honors
College at the University of
Arizona dropped almost 19
percent after students were
required to pay a $500 year-
ly fee, according to a Nov.22
article in the Arizona Daily
Wildcat.
The article reported that
some students felt that grad-
uating with honors wasn't
worth the fee, while others
said it wasn't clear where
the extra money would be
spent.
"I still agree that they
are vague with where the
money is going, and I think

that's something students
deserve to know because
$250 is steep for a semes-
ter," University of Arizona
senior Ryan Kreisberg, who
dropped out of the college,
told the Wildcat.
However, some students
said in the article that the
benefits of the Honors Col-
lege, like smaller classes,
were worth the extra fee.
PROF. HAS CAMERA
IMPLANTED IN HEAD
WafaaBilal, a visual artist
and professor at New York
University's Tisch School of
the Arts, had a small digi-
tal camera implanted in the
back of his head, according
to a Nov. 23 article in The
Huffington Post.
The article reported that

Bilal decided to undergo the
procedure as an art project
for a new museum in Doha,
Qatar.
As part of Bilal's project,
called "The 3rd I," the cam-
era will capture his every-
day activities at one-minute
intervals for one year, and
the images will be transmit-
ted to the museum.
Bilal said in the article
that the project will illu-
minate "important social,
aesthetic, political, tech-
nological and artistic ques-
tions."
The article also reported
that Bilal chose to implant
the camera in the back of his
head as an "allegorical state-
ment" about the things that
people don't see.

FORECLOSURES
From Page 1A
month of October.
Washtenaw County Treasurer
Catherine McClary said one of the
principal reasons for foreclosures
in Ann Arbor is that there are too
many houses for the number of
people living in the city.
McClary said the demand for
student housing has motivated
developers to build more high rises
and condominiums in the city.
"(The) private sector has put up
a lot of new apartments lately," she
said.
McClary said these new devel-
opments could be detrimental
to Ann Arbor because the city is
already crowded with housing
units.
The North Quad Residential
and Academic Complex opened
this fall - and made available for
roughly 460 students. McClary
said the new residence hall didn't
impact foreclosure rates in the city
and emphasized it is the private
sector building housing for Uni-
versity students that is having an
effect.
In 2009, two high rises - Zara-
gon Place on East University Ave-
nue and 4 Eleven Lofts on East
Washington Street - opened.
Combined, the buildings made
590 spaces available for residents.
Developers are currently con-
structing Zaragon Place 2 on the
corner of East William and Thomp-
son streets, which is expected to
house 200 to 350 residents.
Before the housingbubble burst,
McClary, who has been work-
ing with foreclosures since 1999,
started noticing foreclosure trends
around 2005.
McClary said that foreclosure
rates in the eastern part of Washt-
enaw County - like in Ypsilanti -
are currently the highest, but the
number of tax delinquencies, or
unpaid taxes, in the area was sta-
bilizing. While delinquenttaxes do
not directly affect a foreclosure,

McClary said they are a leading
indicator of foreclosure trends.
Tax delinquencies in Ann
Arbor are rising faster than those
in other parts of the county. As a
result, McClary said foreclosures
in Ann Arbor will likely continue
to increase.
Nancy Bowerbank, foreclosure
and short sale manager for Charles
Reinhart Company Realtors, said
the number of foreclosures in Ann
Arbor has been historically low,
but that the city has experienced
an uptick in foreclosures over the
last few years.
However, Bowerbank said the
presence of the University and the
student housing market has helped
keep down the number of foreclo-
sures in Ann Arbor.
Though accommodating Uni-
versity students is what motivated
the private sector to build more
housing, ultimately creating a sur-
plus, McClary said Ann Arbor ben-
efits from the University because
the school significantly contrib-
utes to the city's service and entre-
preneurial sectors. McClary said
these are two key sectors that
have kept Ann Arbor from heav-
ily relying on the auto industry,
the collapse of which has left some
Michigan towns in financial ruin.
According to McClary, the city
is entering the third phase of the
foreclosure crisis in which people
are leaving their homes and pur-
suing job opportunities in other
states.
The first phase began in the mid-
2000s, with predatory lending and
subprime loans. It was during this
time that McClary's office set up a
program that allowed Ann Arbor
homeowners to modify loans.
McClary said the program took
away some of the more predatory
aspects of loans, and that the pro-
gram was adopted in some other
parts of the state.
The second phase began when
massive numbers of Ann Arbor
residents began losing their jobs,
McClary said. During this time,
home and commercial values were

hit hard, as many people lost their
homes because they couldn't pay
their mortgages.
McClary added that the prob-
lem was exacerbated when Pfizer
Inc. moved its employees and offic-
es out of Ann Arbor in 2007.
According to McClary, Pfizer
promised to give its employees up
to $100,000if they sold their homes
and moved locations to remain
with the company. McClary said
Pfizer was a large employer that
contributed to the abundance of
houses for sale in the city.
October foreclosure rates were
astronomical in some other parts
of the state. Monroe county's 48145
ZIP code, home to La Salle Town-
ship, saw a 1,425-percent increase
in foreclosures from last year -
with one in every 12 properties in
foreclosure. In Van Buren County,
one in every 24 households was in
foreclosure in the city of Breeds-
Ville.
Oakland County, one of the
nation's wealthiest counties, also
experienced rises in foreclosures
- with one in every 53 house-
holds in foreclosure in South Lyon
Township.
Cities home to universities are
not immune to foreclosures. The
area surrounding Eastern Michi-
gan University saw a 4.2-percent
increase in foreclosure filings
from September to October - a
54.3-percent jump from October
2009.
In Detroit's 48202 ZIP code,
home to Wayne State University,
there was a 19.1-percent increase
in foreclosures from October last
year, though there was no increase
in filings from Septemberto Octo-
ber of this year.
Despite the University's positive
impact on Ann Arbor, it has not
guarded the city from Michigan's
economic problems. McClary said
there is a stereotype that the Uni-
versity protects Ann Arbor on all
economic fronts.
"There's not a brick wall
between Ann Arbor and Washt-
enaw County," she said.

FBI: Planes and
dogs hunt for three
missing children
The head of Detroit's FBI office
says two planes, police dogs and
the agency's behavioral science
experts are aiding the search for
three southern Michigan boys who
went missing on the same day their
father tried to hang himself.
Police in Morenci say they fear
the boys are in "extreme danger,"
and the father hasn't been ruled out
as a suspect.
Chief Larry Weeks says 39-year-
old John Skelton is being treated
at a hospital in Ohio for "mental
health issues" following Friday's
suicide attempt.
Nine-year-old Andrew, 7-year-
old Alexander and a-year-old
Tanner Skelton were last seen
Thursday. Tanya Skelton report-
ed them missing Friday after her
estranged husband failed to return
them on time.
FBI Detroit chief Andrew Arena
said yesterday that it's routine for
his agency to join suspected abduc-
tion cases.
PORTLAND, Ore.
At Christmas tree
ceremony, bomb
suspect hoped for
'spectacular show'
A Somali-born teenager plotted
"a spectacular show" of terror-
ism for months, saying he didn't
mind that children would die if he
bombed a crowded Christmas tree-
lighting ceremony, according to a
law-enforcement official and court
documents.
He never got the chance.
Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 19,
was arrested Friday in downtown
Portland after using a cell phone
to try to detonate what he thought
were explosives in a van, pros-
ecutors said. It turned out to be a
dummy bomb put together by FBI
agents, and authorities said the
public was never in danger.
The case is the latest in a string
of alleged terrorist planning by
U.S. citizens or residents, includ-
ing a Times Square plot in which a
Pakistan-born man pleaded guilty
earlier this year to trying to set off
a car bomb at a busy street corner.
In the Portland plot, Mohamud
believed he was receiving help from
a larger ring of jihadists as he com-
municated with undercover agents,
but a law enforcement official who
wasn't authorized to discuss the
case publicly and spoke on a condi-
tion of anonymity told The Associ-
ated Press that no foreign terrorist
organization was directing him.

Palin says Iowa
bookstore signing
not a political move
Hundreds turned out for a Sarah
Palin book signing in Iowa, an
event the former Alaska governor

and 2008 Republican vice presi-
dential candidate insisted was not
for political purposes.
Palin's stop Saturday at the Bor-
ders in West Des Moines brought
her back to Iowa, which hosts the
caucuses that kick off the presiden-
tial nominating season.
The "America by Heart" author
has hinted that she's considering a
2012 presidential run, but says the
visit was to promote her new book
and that's all.
Security was tight, and Palin did
no media interviews. People who
bought her book were shuffled to
the signing table in small groups.
RIO DE JANEIRO
Police raid slum to
ensure safety for
upcoming Olympics
Police and soldiers charged into
Rio's most dangerous slum at day
break yesterday, seizing the bastion
of the city's biggest drug gang in a
battle to make the seaside metropo-
lis safe for the Olympics and soc-
cer's World Cup.
Black-clad officers poured into
the Alemao slum complex amid
heavy gunfire, with helicopters fly-
ing low overhead. But the officers
encountered less resistance than
expected and they declared victory
two hours later, even if many gang
members still remained inside.
A Brazilian flag was raised at
the shantytown's highest point at
midday.

But even I underestimated
how much a game like Saturday's
meant. It might as well have been
2008 again - when Michigan
lost 42-7 to Buckeyes - as the
Wolverines couldn't produce any
offense, the defense got run over
and there were no special teams.
Simply put, they just aren't
a 7-5-caliber team. And sure,
for the first time in three years,
Michigan is going to a bowl. But
really, has Michigan played like a
7-5 team at any point this season?
The Wolverines barely hung
on to beat depleted Purdue and
FCS Massachusetts teams; they
needed a final drive to beat
Indiana and Notre Dame, triple
overtime to beat Illinois, and
they blew out a bad MAC team
in Bowling Green. Thoseare
teams with a combined record
of 26-32.
Michigan's one win to hang its
hat on came in the season's first
game against Connecticut. But
when it comes down to it, a mar-
quee win in your third season
should come against a team more
impressive than an 8-4 squad
from the Big East.

"I'm not much for the govern-
ment banning things. We still sell
40-percent alcoholic drinks and

rum on our shelves that people
have killed themselves on," he
said. "I think that it is up to the
consumers to be careful and to
make their own choices."
Maher Jaboro, co-owner of
A & L Wine Castle, also said he
noticed greater interest in the
drink. Before Four Loko was pro-
hibted, Jaboro said he sold one
case each week. Since the ban, he
has sold about five cases a week.
He added that he thinks the
measure is unjustified.
"There's a lot of things that are
similar or even worse, and (the
commission is) just going after
one particular drink. It's just not
right," Jaboro said. "Before it used
to be they were after it because it

Kinesiology senior Will Cook
shared a similar opinion as
Jaboro, noting that students can
make their own Four Loko-style
drinks by mixing alcohol and caf-
feine.
"My problem with the ban is
that there is already alcohol and
stimulants out there, and they're

to be an independent oversight
committee," Friedman said. "I
want to do what I can while I'm
chair to make sure that the rules
of the committee and its relation-
ship with the University are con-
sistent with that."
In an interview last year,
Stephen Hipkiss, the then-DPS
Oversight Committee chair,
said the committee typically
receives two grievances each
year, though eight to 12 com-
plaints are usually filed with
DPS. An issue will be labeled a
grievance or complaint based on
which body the grievant chooses
to review the matter.
Since Jan. 1, 2010, the comnit-
tee has received three grievanc-
es, which have been submitted
through the committee's new
online submission form, accord-
ing to University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald.
Friedman said he could not
disclose information about the
grievances because they are con-
fidential unless the party filing
the grievance allows it to become
public or the matter has been
resolved.
The committee is required to
meet at least twice each year to
discuss grievances. In a Nov. 16,
2009 Daily article, Hipkiss said it
was not uncommon for the com-
mittee to meet only once per year.
The frequency of meetings
has since increased, as Fried-
man said the committee has met
more than twice this semester
and will meet "as many times
as necessary" to resolve issues
brought before it.
"Given what we have before us,
I expect a fair amount (of meet-
ings) plus extensive e-mail cor-
respondence," Friedman said. "It
has turned out to be a real work-
ing committee."
On Nov. 19, LSA senior Rebec-
ca Egler, a member of the Uni-
versity's undergraduate chapter
of the American Civil Liberties
Union, became the third student
to be elected as a student repre-
sentative on the committee.
Five candidates ran in the elec-
tion organized by MSA, and Egler
won with 1,310 votes.
In an interview last week,
Egler said the University's ACLU
chapter encouraged her to rujn.
"We thought it would be a
great idea to try and get someone
with a civil liberties perspective
on the committee to represent
that voice on campus," she said.
Aware of MSA's previous ille-
gal appointments to the commit-
tee, Egler expressed approval of
the campus-wide vote to elect
individuals to the position and
said the election process went
"smoothly."

"I think it's important to make
sure that the people represented
on the committee are also most
representing the students who
are filing these grievances, and
the only way to ensure that is if
the students can elect the com-
mittee members," she said.
To help resolve a grievance,
the committee may make recom-
mendations to University admin-
istrators like Tim Slottow, the
University's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer
who handles the committee's
recommendations. However,
committee members cannot issue
rulings or override previous ver-
dicts.
"They could use persuasion,
but they don't really have the
power to overturn decisions,"
said Ed Rothman, SACUA chair
and professor of statistics.
Because the oversight com-
mittee is only an advisory group,
Rothman said SACUA wants to
form an appeals committee that
has the power to overturn deci-
sions. As an example, Rothman
said the committee would be able
to review trespass orders issued
by DPS.
In the last few weeks, mem-
bers of the University commu-
nity have expressed concern over
DPS's current trespass policy,
which permits all 56 DPS officers
to give trespass warnings when-
ever they deem it necessary.
A trespass order was recently
issued to former Michigan assis-
tant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell, who was banned from
campus after verbally attacking
MSA President Chris Armstrong
at campus events and on his
blog. DPS modified the order less
than two months later, allow-
ing Shirvell at campus locations
where Armstrong is not likely to
be present.
Though changes are needed,
Rothman said he recognizes the
importance of the trespass policy
for protecting members of the
University community.
"There are crazies out there,
and we don't want them running
around campus," he said.
However, he said an immediate
appeals process would make sure
campus officers could not "over-
step their bounds." If implement-
ed, the appeals process would
allow for a small committee to
automatically review the order
the day after a trespass order is
issued to determine if it is jus-
tified or should be withdrawn,
Rothman explained.
Since the DPS Oversight Com-
mittee can only make recom-
mendations, Rothman said it's
necessary to create a separate
committee that can enforce its
own decisions.
"I want a committee that actu-
ally can take action," he said.

Closed housing
'U' needs to work quickly to implement initiative
D espite the best efforts of the Michigan Student Assembly
and members of the Open Housing Initiative, gender-neu-
tral housing will most likely not be an option for fall 2011
University housing. The proposal, which was presented to Univer-
sity Housing last Monday, doesn't appear to be a feasible plan for the
fall given the time-frame before housing options become available
to students. This proposal's delay shows a clear breakdown in com-
munication between student organizations and University Housing.
Though this problem may have been avoided if the open housing
proposal was submitted earlier, University Housing needs.to work
with students to employ the new option as soon as possible to ensure
that all students are in a comfortable living environment.

Building safely in China

After several months of discussion,
Director of University Housing Linda
Newman said that she's not optimistic
that open housing will be an option for fall
2011 student housing, according to a Nov.
23 article in the Daily. Newman disclosed
that as of last Tuesday night she had yet
to see the proposal. Open Housing Initia-
tive member Allison Horky noted that the
group sent the proposal to administrators
that day. Newman claimed in the article
that since returning students sign up for
rooming assignments in late January,
there's not enough time to market and set
up the housing option.
The Open Housing Initiative allows stu-
dents to choose open housing and live with
a roommate of the opposite sex. The option
is beneficial since it provides an addition-
al housing choice for students seeking an
alternative rooming assignment. The Open
Housing Initiative aims to give students
the most comfortable living situation pos-
sible. University Housing needs to support
the Open Housing Initiative because it's
important that all students feel at ease in
their living situation.
Student organizations have been push-
ing for open housing for more than one
year. In December 2009, MSA passed a
resolution asking the University to sup-
port the housing option. And when stu-

dents gave their input on the initiative last
March, 67 percent of survey respondents
said they welcomed the option and 38 per-
cent said they would select the option. The
following April, the Residence Halls Asso-
ciation also voted to support open housing.
There is clearly a high amount of student
support for the initiative.
Unfortunately,membersofthe Open Hous-
ing initiative didn't submit their proposal for
open housing in a timely manner for it to be
implemented by fall 2011. Members failed to
consider the necessary timeline for Univer-
sity Housing to adjust to the new option. At
the same time, University Housing should
have been more proactive. Administrators
could have monitored the Open Housing
Initiative's progress and stepped in to help
if they thought the initiative wasn't going to
be finished in time. Had University Housing
been more actively involved in the process,
open housing may have been a viable option
for students next fall.
University Housing should have been
more heavily involved in the Open Hous-
ing Initiative from the beginning. Until
open housing is available, many students
will continue to be uncomfortable in their
living situations. The Open Housing Ini-
tiative and University Housing need to
collaborate more closely to see if they can
after open housing in a timely fashion.

Whatever China is going to do
about its current crisis, it needs to

tors have and will continue to neglect
security measures if no action is
taken. I'm not saying that the con-
tractors have no regard for the lives
of others, but with no guidance or
standards from the Chinese govern-
ment, they are overlooking little risks
- like a safety net made of an incred-
ibly flammable material - in favor of
quick results. If China wants to avoid
further loss of life and embarrass-
ment, the state of its buildings must
be addressed promptly.

The need for jobless benefits

An ode for my Michigan family

My aunt and uncle came for Thanksgiving
this year, as they do every year. We cooked a
turkey, ate some pumpkin pie and watched a
lot of football - like we do every year. And just
like every year, a raucous political debate was
stirred. Appropriately, we ended up debating
what has become another holiday tradition -
the extension of (or possible lack of an exten-
sion of) federal unemployment benefits.
The benefits are set to expire on Nov. 30,
leaving 168,520 workers in Michigan without
this aid. The expiration date also leaves Con-
gress only two days to take quick and decisive
action when it gets back from recess to extend
the benefits.
The debate my aunt and I had reflects a larg-
er national debate. Republicans, like my aunt,
say that the extension of unemployment ben-
efits - which would cost only about $60 billion
for one year - are a continuation of the out-
of-control spending and deficit ignorance that
characterizes the Obama administration. I find
this kind of ironic, since she and almost every
other Republican support extending the Bush
tax cuts for the wealthiest of citizens - a policy
that would add an astounding $700 billion to
the deficit over the next 10 years.
This stance not only seems quite contradic-
tory for any "deficit hawk," but there also isn't
any proof that the Bush tax cuts would help the
economy. Jobless workers who receive aid will
- out of necessity for the basics - spend this
money, and put it back into the economy. On
the other hand, wealthy citizens who reap gen-
erously from the Bush tax cuts will end up sav-
ing the extra money thatthey would have spent
on taxes because there is no immediate need to

spend, which inevitably worsens the economy.
But what frustrates me more than Repub-
licans ignoring the economic arguments in
this debate is when they resort to the incred-
ibly trite behavioral arguments. These con-
descending remarks consist of knocking the
unemployed as lazy, whiny and dependent on
government aid - as if these so-called gener-
ous benefits were more than just a means to
subsist. It's absurd to think that the meager
amount given to the unemployed could possi-
bly dissuade someone from looking for or even
accepting a job. It's a fact that there is a scar-
city of employment - especially in Michigan
where the jobless rate is the second highest
in the country. People who believe the image
perpetuated by conservatives - that the unem-
ployed live a luxurious life of free riding - are
blatantly and naively ignorant of the reality of
poverty and joblessness.
It seems as though America is in desper-
ate need of rethinking its priorities. While
many Americans are struggling and so many
are out of work, why are we, as a nation, even
bothering to think about keeping the Bush tax
cuts? Why are we even debating extending the
unemployment benefits? Both legislators and
voters alike need to realize that valuing and
privileging the wealthy over the unemployed
will eventually cause economic collapse. There
is no reasonable economic or moral argument
for not extending the unemployment ben-
efits. Congress needs to act immediately after
returning from recess to keep extending aid for
the unemployed.

recalling the happi-

of my life - my years as a Wolverine.
Recalling the sad memories is easy
because they are few and far apart. But

As I begin to rewind the tape, I

Breaking out of the shell
During my sophomore year, I real-
ized the extent to which living in Baits
II housing the previous year - as a non-
engineering student - had deprived
me of the college experience. I never
attended a football game, I never went
to parties, I hadn't consumed a drop of
alcohol and I spent most of my Friday
nights writing essays.
The transition started with John
Hurlahe, a charismatic kid from Fran-
kenmuth, Mich., - a town I was only
aware of thanks to Bronner's Christ-
mas Wonderland, the world's largest

Christmas store. We had begun study-
ing together for our economics classes,
and it seemed that by October, there
wasn't a day that went by where Ididn't
see John for lunch or dinner.
And soon it wasn't just John, it was
also Ryan Kartje, John's neighbor,
hailing from the little town of Milan,
Mich. Itwas Alex O'Dell, John's room-
mate, whose mind was in a constant
state of creative stream of conscious-
ness. It was Orfeh Vahabzadeh, Alex's
girlfriend, simultaneously brilliant
and hilarious. It was the entire Fran-
kenmuth gang, alongwith alight sprin-
kling of natives from my hometown of
Troy who had also been engulfed by
the group's magnetism.
By December, I had attended sev-
eral concerts. I made the horrible
choice of going to one while wear-
ing a ridiculous turtle-neck - shoot
me now and forgive me later. I also
had my first drink. "Yup, I can defi-
nitely feel it?" I exclaimed in all my
pathetic "lightweightness" after sev-
eral sips of a Mike's Hard Lemonade.
I finally bought football season tickets
and expanded my social circle at an
unprecedented rate.
They say that you don't realize what
you have until it's no longer there. But
my sophomore year was the exact
opposite - I didn't realize what I had
missed until good ol' John and his
gang danced their way into my life,
addingcolor wherever black and white
had been the rule.
Branching out
By junior year two new social
spheres emerged: my fellow incoming
classmates at the Ford School of Public
Policy, and my resident advisors, com-
munity assistants and ResStaff col-
leagues in Stockwell Hall.
The Ford School crew - a driven
community of scholars who will be
doing great things in high places while
I will likely still be finishing my dis-
sertation - provided constant intel-
lectual stimuli. Mv Stockwell friends

- a group of socially aware and ser-
vice-minded individuals who'll offer
you support when you most need it -
challenged me to embrace social jus-
tice and to challenge the status quo.
And so it was that by the time my
junior year was over, I felt like I had
changed more in three years than I
had over my entire lifetime prior to
coming to the University.
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't
mention the great relationships I've
had with my professors. I was lucky
enough to get to know some brilliant
scholars who cared deeply about their
students and their individual interests.
I attended conferences with them,
chatted with them about life over cof-
fee and received invaluable advice
from them regarding graduate school.
It goes without saying that it's because
I respectmy professors thatI'm pursu-
ing a career path in academia.
What has made
my Michigan
difference.
The final statement
Despite my decision to attend the
University because of its academic
prestige, my Michigan years have
been defined by positive relationships.
The friends I've made here have been
an unwavering source of support and
have constantly challenged me to
become abetter person.
To my Michigan family, thank you
for shining happiness into my life. I
hope, in my own way, that I have held
up a mirror and reflected some of it
back.

Case in point:
his latest attempt at romantic
comedy, the sloppy, sticky "Love

bestselling memoir of Viagra drug
W rep Jamie Reidy, "Love" is a bipo-
lar disaster waiting to happen - a
sex comedy about a womanizing
Pfizer salesman (Jake Gyllen-
haal, "Brokeback Mountain") that
transmogrifies into a PSA about
Parkinson's disease. The muta-
tion begins when Anne Hathaway
("Rachel Getting Married") comes

storyline, tremor by tremor.
Films generally have a natural
rhythm, a beat that carries them
through strands of dialogue and
scene changes with relative ease.
This rhythm is exceptionally
important in films with relatively
little substance, i.e. romantic com-

the rom from the corm so that one
doesn't swallow up the other in

Argus TV Studio has four permanent sets and was built with an uneven floor.
The University

Argus studio gives
aspiring directors
a training ground
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
Follow William Street west-
ward for a little more than a mile
off campus. Go past Beer Depot
and the noisy bus stop. Keep
straight even when the bustle of
Main Street dissolves into quiet
residential houses with lawns
buried in fallen leaves. Stay on
William until it ends in front of a
low, unassuming brick building.
As the blue sign out front pro-
claims, this is the home of "Argus
TV Studio II."
The Argus building itself has
been here for many years. Before
World War II, it was a factory
for the Argus Camera Company,
known in photography history for
mass-producing the 35 mm cam-
era. After the war, the building
was converted into a TV studio for
a production company.
"The film industry has been in

Michigan for a while. I think the
building's history demonstrates
that," said Terri Sarris, a senior
lecturer who teaches the classes
in the studio. "At the time, (the
production company) was fairly
successful in terms of television
in Michigan. They did some stuff
for PBS."
But luckily for Sarris and her
students, the company wasn't suc-
cessful enough and had a bit of
difficulty with an uneven floor.
"The first time they poured
the cement in for the floor, it was
uneven," said Rob Hoffman, the
chief media engineer at the studio.
"It was really expensive to redo so
they lost a lot of money. Actually,
the floor is still kind of uneven
today."
By the late 1980s, according
to Sarris, the University bought
it - uneven floors and all - and
started to use it as an educational
facility.
Today, only those who take the
Screen Arts and Cultures studio
classes - which include SAC 290
(Introduction to Film, Video and
Television Production) and Sar-
ris's sitcom class in the winter -

TV set
seem to be aware of the studio's
existence.
"The whole point of the classes
is to teach students how to work in
the studio, and how to handle the
equipment. It requires expertise,"
Sarris said.
Despite the building's distance
from campus, the studio is buzz-
ing. There are four permanent
sets standing in various corners
of the room - an office; a kitchen
with a granite countertop, stove
and sink; a living room of what
appears to be a very comfort-
able apartment; and a talk show
set with a dusty potted plant and
leather chairs. The sets are their
own little worlds, complete with
characters played by students in
acting classes and captured by
the three cameras rumbling by on
wheels.
Looking into the room, it's
easy to forget the piles of tangled
wires on the floor or the boom
mic swinging overhead. Students

'Skating With the Stars' is reality TV crap on ice

a

No one will care
about ABC's excuses
for celebrities
By LINDSAY HURD
DailyArts Writer
Even if winter seems like the
perfect opportunity for a show
about ice skating,
"Skating with
the Stars" proves
that, once again, Skating Wth
British reality
TV knock-offs The Stars
are not the way Mondays
to win any sort of at 8 p.m.
medals. AB
ABC's lat-
est desperate
attempt at big-hit reality TV pro-
gramming has led to the atrocious
idea to make celebrities ice skate.
Riding on the success of "Danc-

ig with the Stars," the format of
"Skating" mirrors that of its pre-
decessor. Each so-called celebrity
is paired with an expert partner to
perform a routine each week, and
voted off the next day. But don't
be fooled - this show is a million
times worse than "Dancing with
the Stars," which itself is pretty
annoying.
There are two major issues with
"Skating" that make it unbear-
able to watch. First, the celebrity
contestants are not celebrities at
all. ABC has clearly lowered their
standards with the D-list lineup,
which includes Johnny Moseley,
Vince Neil, Bethenny Frankel,
Rebecca Budig, Sean Young and
Brandon Mychal Smith. Who are
any of these people? According
to the show, their claims to fame
range from "Disney superstar" to
"rock legend." It's pretty sad when
Bethenny Frankel, a "Real House-
wife," is the show's biggest talent

when "Dancing with the Stars"
has had at least a few recognizable
stars on all of its seasons.
Issue number two: Inherently,
there's a giant problem with the
idea of making people skate who
never have before - skating is
just plain difficult. Learning the
moves for Yost Ice Arena's open
skate night is one thing, but doing
it on TV is another. It's hard to even
stand up, let alone try and do spins
and jumps. As a result, the "perfor-
mances" from the celebs consist of
them gliding around doing bumpy
child-like tricks and hand motions
that supposedly count as routines
because they are on TV. Not only
is it awkward to watch, but you can
tell all of the celebs are thinking
they have reached the lowest point
of desperation as soon as they get
out on the ice.
The rest of the show attempts
to make up for the lack of compel-
ling on-ice content - in the most
in the studio, something that isn't
reallyused in the world of television
today. Most modern shows are edit-
ed in post-production rather than
filmed live. Students still value the
experience, though.
"I like it. It's very hands-on,
there's a lot of action on the set. It's
not a traditional classroom experi-
ence. We aren't just being lectured,"
LSA junior Tracey Zane said.
"The students in the class allhave
different interests," Sarris said.
"While live camera may not really
be practiced, what the students
learn is broad enough that it's rele-
vant to anyone. It's a stepping stone
to another medium. Here, students
can get their feet wet, get creative
and then move on to what interests

buttons and mysterious levers.
They mumble directions into their
headsets until, suddenly, a hush
falls over the set: "Let's slate this
scene," someone in the control room
says. "Ready? And, action." Class
has started.
"This isn't a typical studio here,"
Hoffman said. "If you were to go
out to L.A., you'd see that they have
whole stages for a show. What we
try to do here is mimic that."
The students work with the cam-
eras and have to find a way to bring
the different shots together in a way

that viewers will find believable.
This is harder than it seems - some-
times shirts show up as different
colors in different shots, sometimes
people aren't in focus.
"It's overwhelming to look at the
screen and make choices about a
shot, but there's alot of practice and
it's rewarding to see how much bet-
ter (my students) get," Sarris said.
"When you wttch a show on televi-
sion, it's easy to forget how much of
it can be illusion. Like here on this
set, that wall is just held up by some
weights and that staircase goes
nowhere."

But there is something sad about

"I personally will feel I've lost

said. "But it'll be nice to be in a

"Pac-Man" in Network
its title has any Nam Bandai
right to be in
2010. It's probably the best thing
Pac-Man has ever been a part of,
and one of the best downloadable
games released this year.
"Championship Edition DX"
still has the same classic idea: Eat
as many dots, fruits, power pel-
lets and ghosts as possible to get

a high score. But the concepts
behind each of those goals have
changed drastically. Each maze
that Pac-Man has to navigate is
now horizontal instead of verti-
cal, and when all of the dots are
eaten on one side of the maze, a
fruit materializes. When that fruit
is eaten, the other side of the maze
transforms into a different layout.
When all the dots are eaten on
that side of the maze, the other
side transforms and the process
continues. The constant shifting
of the maze design keeps you on
your toes, figuring out which way
to go.
This on its own is compelling,
but the revamped ghosts make
the game an absolute blast. Many
ghosts begin the game sleeping
and idle. Passing them on the
way to eating dots and fruits will
awaken them, and they will give
chase. An insane amount of ghosts
will actively and intently pursue
players until a coveted power pel-
let is found. The feeling of turning
around and eating 50 ghosts or so
in a row is ridiculously satisfy-
ing. It's the best part of the game
and it never gets old. It's also the
quickest way to gain points, so it's
something to try often.

All modes in "Championship
Edition DX" are time-based,
offering five- or 10-minute score
attack options. Time trials also
track how fast a certain amount
of fruit can be eaten. Each maze is
smartly designed to show a clear
path to all the dots. But as your
score increases, the game speed
also increases at a frantic rate so
veering off course is inevitable.
If Pac-Man is about to run into
a ghost, the game automatically
slows down into bullet time, giv-
ing a bit of breathing room to
make split-second decisions.
The game looks and sounds
phenomenal. Everything has a
colorful, neon glow to it, with
a thumping, energetic techno
soundtrack that fits well with the
frenzied nature of the gameplay.
The retro sound effects are ter-
rific, especially the noise when
eating ghosts. Each maze has
numerous color palettes and art
styles, as well.
The complaints that could be
lobbied against "Championship
Edition DX" are really quite incon-
sequential. Yes, there are a total of
10 mazes, and while it would have
been nice to have more mazes and
modes, that's pretty nitpicky for a

$10 game. The game is also lenient
in handing out lives, meaning it's
too easy to survive, but it's not
about surviving. It's about the
high score and getting a ranking
on the global leaderboard. The
absurdly fun "Championship Edi-
tion DX" is ne of the few games
that actually make high scores
feel like they matter in this day
and age.

awesome the performances of
the contestants were, and lays on
the hyperbole. When phrases like
* "This is the most thrilling and
dangerous show on TV!" are fol-
lowed by gawky ice gliding, it's
really hard to try to take the pro-
ceedings seriously.
And then there's the fact that
every star's most difficult move is
replayed in painful slow motion
after the fact, which makes each
performance even more uncom-
fortable. No one needs to see
Vince Neil twirl ineptly twice,
ever. It adds insult to injury - not
only for the stars, but for everyone
watching.
And then there are the judges:
Johnny Weir, Dick Button and
Laurieann Gibson. They don't

really seem to know what the flip
they're talking about. Ninety-five
percent of their comments are
just a mesh of random adjectives
thrown together because they
didn't know what else to say. Even
pro skater Weir, known for his
colorful antics, just exclaims how
"awesome" and "inspiring" every
sucky performance is. It's clear
the judges also think this show is
a piece of crap on ice, but are just
going with it in hopes that the gig
launches their next 15 minutes of
fame.
"Skating with the Stars" goes
past the point of obnoxious and
straight to intolerable, practically
forcing you to turn the TV off. In
the end, the only thing that could
save this show is if one of the stars
completely biffed it on the ice and
made an even bigger fool of them-
selves. But the show denies us
even this pleasure, which may be
the biggest injustice of all.

Meram, Saad send 'M' to Elite Eight

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBIA, S.C. - The Sweet
Sixteen proved to be just that for
the No. 10 seed Michigan men's
soccer
team on MICHIGAN 3
Sunday, SOUTH CAROLINA 1
as the
Wolverines defeated seventh-
seeded host South Carolina, 3-1.
With the win, Michigan moves
on to the Elite Eight to face No. 2
seed Maryland next weekend in
College Park, Md.
"Hats off to Carolina," Michi-
gan coach Steve Burns said after
the game. "They were a really
tough team, as we knew they
would be."
The first half saw several legiti-
mate threats by both sides, though
the Wolverines (16-4-3) led on the
stat sheet.
An 11-7 shots advantage for
Michigan contributed to an over-
whelming feeling at Stone Stadium
that a breakthrough was imminent.

Before the eventual goal how-
ever - a toe poke from senior for-
ward Justin Meram that found the
lower right corner of the net - it
seemed that the Wolverines would
once again fall victim to superb
goalkeeping from a feisty oppo-
nent.
In the tournament's second
round, Central Florida forced
overtime with Michigan, mostly
due to brilliant saves on the part of
the Knights.
However, Meram's goal silenced
the garnet-clad faithful. Senior
Gamecock goalie Jimmy Maurer
was no longer the brick wall that
the Wolverines had been firing at
in the first half.
It took a while for Michigan's
attack to adjust to Maurer's goal-
keeping style, which differed sig-
nificantly from that of last week's
opponent.
Burns attributed Maurer's
success to his "bigger range"
compared to the Central Florida

was located at the center
of the universe
and all other
objects orbited
around it.

edly.
But, as you know, that wasn't
the case. It wasn't until the 16th
century when Copernicus pub-
lished his heliocentric model that
anyone thought the sun was the
center of the universe.
This weekend, I saw a similar
gaffe happening in the minds of
Michigan fans across the coun-
try. With Rich Rodriguez's job in
absolute jeopardy, they turned
their attention to a certain for-
mer Michigan quarterback and
current Stanford head coach. And
in pre-Copernican fashion, many
Wolverine fans have decided Jim
Harbaugh will be next in line to
walk the sidelines of Michigan
Stadium.
Heck, he might as well have
been named Michigan's head
coach on Sunday.
The fact of the matter is, he
wasn't and won't be right away.
Yes, there's a chance that he
does coach the Wolverines next
season. But what many Michigan
fans don't understand - and this
is where Ancient Greece comes
in - is that the University of
Michigan might not be the best
option for Harbaugh. Maybe, for
Harbaugh, the football world
doesn't revolve around Michigan,
like many fans and alumni think
it does.
There's no doubt that the Wol-
verines have to be toward the
top of Harbaugh's list and he's

definitely on top of theirs. But is
Michigan at the very top?
With how well Harbaugh has
done in Palo Alto, there may not
even be reason for him to leave
the sunny beaches of Califor-
nia. He has a pretty good thing
going with the Cardinal, tak-
ing them from a 4-8 team in his
first season to an 11-1 record and
top-five ranking this season. He
also recruited and built up quar-
terback Andrew Luck, who will
most likely be the No. 1 player
drafted in April's NFL Draft.
But fans at Stanford don't quite
appreciate Harbaugh's success.
In one of the Cardinal's most
recent home games, the stands
were just two-thirds full. That's
not so typical of a program that
will likely play in a BCS bowl
come January. And it's something
that doesn't sit well with Har-
baugh or any of Stanford's former
coaches.
"On most campuses with foot-
ball, when you wake up on Sat-
urday morning and look around,
you can tell something is going
to happen, even if you're not sure
what it is," a former Stanford
coach told the San Jose Mercury
News. "Not here."
So sure, he'll probably leave
Palo Alto. And he would never
have to deal with attendance
problems at Michigan Stadium
- the Wolverines haven't seen a
crowd of less than 100,000 since
October 25, 1975.
But maybe attendance isn't the
issue. Maybe he'd prefer to follow
the steps of a certain Stanford
football coach who made it pretty
well at the next level - with the
San Francisco 49ers.
After being named Pac-8
Coach of the Year in 1977, leg-
endary coach Bill Walsh left the
Cardinal for the 49ers. Three
Super Bowls later, I'm guessing
he doesn't regret his decision to
jump to the NFL.
And Harbaugh could do the
same without a blink of an eye.

PAUL SAKUMA/AP
Stanford football coach Jim Harbaugh played quarterback at Michigan and has suc-
cessfully built Stanford into a top-5 team. It's not guaranteed he'll come to Michigan.

open, just as the Michigan job
will likely be open. And you bet-
ter believe that San Francisco
will make a push for Harbaugh.
John Harbaugh, Jim's brother,
could also be in his ear when it
comes to coaching at the next
level. John currently coaches the
Baltimore Ravens, and the two
are known to have a very close
relationship - one that could
blossom for all to see on the NFL
landscape.
That's not to take away from
the pageantry and great oppor-
tunity Harbaugh has in Ann
Arbor, a campus where he will be
revered and exalted as the savior
of Michigan football. To experi-
ence that feeling from your own
alma mater would be a pretty
good selling point for anyone.
It's also widely known that
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
would prefer to avoid a tedious
coaching search, if/when Rodri-
guez is no longer Michigan's
coach. After all, the last coaching
search at Michigan was one of
the most embarrassing fiascos of
former athletic director Bill Mar-
tin's career.

But if there's anything we can
learn from Martin's mistakes, it's
that Michigan is not the center of
the college football universe.
And the Wolverine faithful
can't handle losing Harbaugh like
they lost Les Miles - another
"sure thing" - after Lloyd Carr
retired following the 2007 sea-
son.
So temper your expectations
about Harbaugh and remember
that the University of Michigan
isn't the end-all-be-all of coach-
ing positions. Maybe he comes to
Ann Arbor and turns the whole
program around. Maybe he goes
to the NFL and wins a Super
Bowl. Maybe Rich Rodriguez
comes back next year.
The point is we don't know.
And if Brandon waits until the
bowl game to decide on Rodri-
guez's future, we may never know
what would have been. Harbaugh
could move 33 miles down the
road to San Francisco by then.

Now, I understand that for most
Michigan men's basketball fans,
this weekend won't look like much
of an accomplishment. The Legends
Classic will be remembered as the
event where the Wolverines got
their first two losses of the season,
where they spent their Thanksgiv-
ing breaks, where UTEP dunked
on them five times, where they fin-
ished fourth - out of four.
But, honestly, it was about time
they got beat. And I don't mean that
in a vengeful sort of way. I mean
that there's only so much to learn
when you're defeating teams like

Michigan was added to the Wol-
verines' learning curve and I think
the shoreline tourney did just that.
A three-point loss to No. 9 Syra-
cuse and a nine-point loss to UTEP
mean more for the growth of the
Wolverines than any other victory
on Michigan's schedule so far this
season.
These young players needed to
face an opponent that forced them
to examine - in game play - every

a team that pushed the Wolverines

THEY'LL BE BACK: Seven in
a row, nine of the last 10 times,
Ohio State has beaten Michigan.
The Wolverines' ineptness
since Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez took over in 2008,
in particular, has drawn more
attention to the lack of parity.
Ohio State has outscored Michi-
gan 100-24 in the three losses
under Rodriguez. The Buckeyes
haven't dominated Michigan
over a three-game span to that
degree since the 1930s when the
Wolverines were shut out four
years in a row.
The sentiment in the Ohio
State press conference after the
30-point win was that Michi-
gan's always a tough game - and
that the Wolverines will bounce
back.
"Michigan is among the elite
programs, and will be," Tressel
said. "Their record will reflect
that, over the course of time. You
know, we all have our ups and
downs and periods and so forth.

said. "What do you want me to

... There's constantly changes.
But Michigan will be back. You
don't have to worry about that."
Tressel has yet to experience
the "downs." Saturday's win
clinched the Buckeyes' sixth
straight Big Ten championship.
He holds a 9-1 record over Mich-
igan.
MOVE OVER HART: Even
though sophomore quarter-
back Denard Robinson missed
time with dislocated fingers on
his non-throwing hand, he still
managed to run through the
Buckeyes' defense for 105 yards.
Not only was it the second
time that Ohio State allowed a
100-yard rusher all season, but
Robinson's 1,643 rushing yards
pushed him past Mike Hart for
the fifth-highest single-season
total in school history. Robin-
son is just 31 yards behind Chris
Perry at No. 4; 60 yards behind
James Morris at No. 3; and 90

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN

MAIZE GAUGE
SPREAD-O-METER

The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Spread-o-Meter measures the success of quarterbacks, the Rod-o-Meter
judges how emotional (positive or negative) Rich Rodriguez was following the game and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

ROD-O-METER

0

1 Michigan posted a season-low seven points. The
Wolverines moved the ball in the first quarter, but
came up empty after a failed fourth-down attempt
Denards and a fumble. The frest was merely a formality
as Ohio State dominated all parts of the game.

4/4
Rich Rods

At the podium after the game, Rich Rodriguez was
the center of attention. In addition to questions
about his anemic offense, Rodriguez fielded some
questions about his job security. Agitated by the
end, he requested questions solely about the game.

HYPE-0-METER
2/4 The Game? The biggest rivalry in sports? There were
very, very few Michigan fans who made the trip. Ohio
State fans were pumped up for most of the game - but
Big Houses they didn't all stay through the end since apparently
beating Michigan isn't the same as it used to be.

LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

Nope, no one really looking good after this one.

ARIEL BOND/Daily
HEAD COACH RICH RODRIGUEZ
Before the season started, national consensus was
that Rodriguez was on the hot seat. That seat cooled
during Michigan's red-hot September as Denard
Robinson's Heisman hype soared. But as soon as Big
Ten season began, the seat heated up once more.
Through three seasons at Michigan, Rodriguez
has gone 0-3 against Michigan State. He's gone
0-3 against Ohio State. He hasn't beaten a Big Ten
opponent that ultimately finished the season with a
winning record. Victories over teams like Indiana -
even the 30T thriller over Illinois - impress nobody.
After two blowout losses to two of the Big Ten
champions (Wisconsin and Ohio State), many think
it's time to seriously consider a coaching change.
