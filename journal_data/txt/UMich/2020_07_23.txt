A lawsuit filed in the District 

Court 
of 
Nebraska 
Monday 

alleges 
Tamiko 
Strickman, 

director 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Office of Institutional 
Equity, 
mishandled 
student 

reports of sexual assault and 
violated 
sex 
discrimination 

and civil rights laws at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
Nine current or former UNL 
students are named plaintiffs in 
the lawsuit. Strickland served 
as 
an 
investigator, 
deputy 

Title IX coordinator, Title IX 
coordinator and director of the 
Office of Institutional Equity and 
Compliance at UNL from 2015 to 
2019.

The lawsuit states Strickman 

was terminated from UNL in 
December 
2019. 
University 

of 
Michigan 
spokesman 

Rick 
Fitzgerald 
and 
UNL 

spokesperson 
Leslie 
Reed 

both told The Daily in emails 
Strickman was not terminated 
from UNL. Reed said Strickman is 
highly qualified and UNL would 
have “liked very much to keep 
her.” The University of Michigan 
announced Strickman’s hiring in 
December 2019 and became OIE 

Director

effective in January 2020.
Fitzgerald said the University 

is aware of the lawsuit, but 
declined to comment as the 
complaint was not filed against 
the University. 

Miranda Melson, a former 

UNL student, was raped by a 
male student in July 2016 after 
explicitly telling him she did 
not want a “one-night stand,” 
the lawsuit says. When the male 
student allegedly undressed and 
began touching Melson sexually, 
she was frozen and unable to 
verbalize her objection. The male 
student continued to contact 
Melson 
against 
her 
wishes 

until she reported the rape and 
stalking to the UNL IEC in 
September 2016, the lawsuit says. 

Strickman 
was 
allegedly 

assigned to Melson’s case. Melson 
asked Strickman to record their 
interviews, the lawsuit says, 
but Strickman refused and only 
recorded the male student’s 
interviews. IEC interviewed the 
male student’s witness, but not 
Melson’s witness, according to 
the lawsuit. 

During 
one 
meeting, 

Strickman allegedly told Melson, 
“This would be different if I were 
your parent, but I’m not your 
parent.”

In a November 2016 letter to 

Melson, Strickman wrote that 

no findings were made about 
Melson’s 
stalking 
or 
assault 

claims, the lawsuit says.

“During the parties’ sexual 

interaction, you did not inform 
Respondent through words or 
actions [that] you did not consent 
to the sexual activity,” Strickman 
allegedly 
wrote. 
“Therefore, 

no sanction is deemed to be 
appropriate or necessary.” 

The 
lawsuit 
alleges 
a 

requirement for an affirmative 
rejection contradicts the UNL 
Student 
Code 
of 
Conduct’s 

definition of consent. 

“‘Consent’ means agreement, 

approval or permission as to some 
act or purpose, given voluntarily 
by a competent person,” the Code 
of Conduct reads. “A person need 
not resist verbally or physically 
where it would be useless or 
futile to do so.”

The lawsuit also alleges a 

requirement for an affirmative 
rejection 
contradicts 
the 

definition of consent on IEC’s 
website.

“Consent is an affirmative 

decision to engage in mutually 
acceptable sexual activity by 
clear actions and words,” the 
website reads. “Silence does 
not equal consent. Moreover,

Effective immediately, the University 

of Michigan will require all students, 
staff, faculty and visitors to wear a 
face covering while anywhere on 
campus grounds, University President 
Mark Schlissel wrote in an email to 
the campus community Wednesday 
afternoon. 

“This includes when inside buildings, 

outdoors and on U-M transportation on 
all of our campuses,” Schlissel wrote. “It 
is difficult on a busy university campus 
to maintain distance from groups 
even while outdoors, so requiring face 
coverings outdoors will help slow the 
spread of the virus.”

Schlissel’s 
announcement 
is 

his first communication with the 
broader University community since 
announcing a “public health-informed 
in-residence” fall semester on June 22. 

The 
new 
policy 
will 
apply 

to 
community 
members 
inside 

buildings, outdoors and on University 
transportation. 
While 
homemade 

masks, 
scarves, 
bandanas 
and 

handkerchiefs 
are 
acceptable, 
the 

policy recommends face coverings that 
seal as tightly as possible to the face. 

However, 
there 
are 
a 
dozen 

exceptions to the face covering rule, 
including when one is in a private 
office or dorm room, eating or drinking 
while 
maintaining 
social 
distance 

and engaging in recreation while 
maintaining social distance. Medical 
exemptions are also noted in the policy. 

According to the policy, transmission 

of COVID-19 is greatly reduced and 
lives are saved when all people wear 
face coverings in public.

19 are mild or asymptomatic and

Cynthia Wilbanks, Univer-

sity of Michigan vice presi-
dent for government relations, 
announced her plans to retire in 
December 2020. She served as 
the vice president at the Univer-
sity for 22 years, and is the long-
est-serving executive officer. 

In her tenure as vice presi-

dent, 
Wilbanks 
worked 
to 

develop University responses to 
proposed local, state and feder-
al legislation. She also worked 
with government officials at all 
levels and oversaw several state 
outreach programs.

In a statement, University 

President Mark Schlissel praised 
Wilbanks for her deep know-
ledge and tireless work ethic. 

“In my view, her vast know-

ledge of our state, its issues, his-
tory, people and, of course, those 
elected to serve is unparalleled,” 
Schlissel said. “Cynthia has 
always applied her keen under-
standing when advocating for 
our students, faculty and staff in 
city hall, Lansing, Congress or 
the White House.” 

Beyond her role as vice presi-

dent, Wilbanks served in a 
leadership capacity in many 
other University programs and 
projects including the Bentley 
Historical 
Library 
Executive 

Committee, Bicentennial Plan-
ning Committee 2011-12, Gins-
berg Center Board, Hospital 
and Health Centers Executive 
Board, Honorary Degree Com-
mittee, Michigan in Washing-
ton Program Faculty Advisory 
Committee and the Residency 
Appeals Committee. 

In an interview with The 

Daily, Wilbanks cited the power 
and strength of her relationships 
with colleagues, elected officials 
and organizations near and far 
as the hallmark of her role. 

“The key to me, and it’s always 

been this, is the value of strong 
relationships,” Wilbanks said. 
“Fundamentally, this work isn’t 

possible without a commitment 
to 
building 
strong 
relation-

ships.” 

LSA alum Nadav Neuman, 

who worked as a Government 
Relations Intern in the Office of 
the Vice President for Govern-
ment Relations, told The Daily 
Wilbanks is a leader who com-
mands respect and recognizes 
the power in cultivating rela-
tionships. 

“Everyone in the office has 

nothing but good to say about 
her,” Neuman said. “She’s an 
amazing person and she’s defin-
itely served the University very 
well over her 20-plus years.” 

Though 
Neuman 
worked 

under the State Relations Office, 
a subsidiary of the Government 
Relations Office, he told The 
Daily Wilbanks made sure to 
recognize and give attention 
to employees at all levels of the 
organization.

“She really showed a keen 

interest in students and helping 
them develop,” Neuman said. 
“When you’re working at any 
place, having the head boss come 
in and ask you what you’re doing 
is always an awesome experi-
ence and it makes you feel good.”

Wilbanks served as an advis-

or to Schlissel on the University 
Research Corridor, a project 
linking the state of Michigan’s 
three 
research 
universities: 

the University of Michigan, 
Michigan State University and 
Wayne State University. She said 
the project was born out of the 
desire to showcase Michigan’s 
research universities as an eco-
nomic powerhouse and benefi-
cial for the state.

“(The 
University 
Research 

Corridor) was born out of the 
strong belief that the state of 
Michigan was among just a 
handful of states where there 
were three very strong research 
universities,” 
Wilbanks 
said. 

“We believe that the asset that 
it represents for the state is an 
enormously powerful asset.” 

Amid the COVID-19 pan-

demic, Wilbanks said the uni-
versities have collaborated in 
the fields of epidemiology, pub-
lic health and education.

VP for government 
relations retires

The Washtenaw County Board 

of Health declared racism a public 
health crisis in a resolution passed 
in a June 30 meeting. The move 
follows numerous other states and 
cities, including Ypsilanti, which 
passed its own resolution on June 
2. In a press release, James Carty, 
the chair of the Board of Health, 
explained the rationale behind this 
decision.

“We know that racism has helped 

drive unequal economic, cultural, 
and medical circumstances that 
each, and in concert, lead to poorer 
health outcomes for people of color 
throughout America,” Carty said. 
“The only way to change this is 
to acknowledge it and center it as 
we try to learn from the mistakes 
of our past and build a better 
community where all residents 
of Washtenaw County are served 
fairly and equally.” 

The move follows several high-

profile cases of police brutality, 
which 
have 
sparked 
protests 

and outrage nationwide all in 
the midst of a pandemic that 
disproportionately impacts African 
Americans in Washtenaw County 
and around the country. Felicia 
Brabec, a member of the Board of 
Health, made it clear that solving 
the 
inequities 
in 
health 
care 

requires more than words.

“This 
declaration 
and 

commitment to health equity – as 
well as the expected action from 
the Board of Commissioners are 

critical to our ability to move 
forward together,” Brabec said in 
the press release. “Naming racism 
and truly working together are 
vital steps, but we must commit 
to doing more. We must show our 
commitment at every level, put 
resources behind our intentions and 
work collectively to see meaningful 
and lasting change.” 

Brabec also sits on the Board 

of Commissioners for Washtenaw 
County, which is expected to pass 
a similar resolution at its next 
meeting on August 5.

Washtenaw 
County 
ranked 

81st out of 83 Michigan counties 
for income inequality in 2018, 
which prompted the Board of 
Commissioners 
to 
unanimously 

pass a new equity policy for the 
county. 
The 
policy 
created 
a 

Racial Equity Office and required 
departments to draft Racial Equity 
Action Plans. Despite these efforts, 
32% of COVID-19 cases are Black 
residents, who make up 12.3% of 
Washtenaw County. Zip codes 
48197 and 49198 in Ypsilanti, whose 
population is 27.3 percent Black 
residents, have over 800 combined 
cases of COVID-19. By contrast, 
the four zip codes encompassing 
Ann Arbor, which is only 6.5 
percent Black, have over 500 cases 
combined. Black residents have 
cited numerous factors, including 
poverty and housing instability, as 
contributing to the disparate impact 
of COVID-19 on their communities.

Belinda Needham, Public Health 

associate professor, said she felt 
this resolution was a start towards 
mending the inequalities in the 
community in an email to The 
Daily.

Washtenaw County 
community discusses 
impacts of decision

After 22 years of service, 

Cynthia Wilbanks 
announces her leave


The Board of Regents held its 

sixth meeting of the year Thursday 
afternoon to hear from public com-
menters urging the University of 
Michigan to consider student input 
on administrative decisions and to 
continue expanding plans for an in-
residence academic year.

All Regents, except Regent Kath-

erine White (D), and University 
executive officers were present for 
the meeting. This was the first 
meeting in which Regents Denise 
Ilitch (D) and Jordan Acker (D) 
served as chair and vice chair of the 
board.

During 
the 
regular 
agenda, 

University President Mark Schlis-
sel announced he was appointing 
Susan M. Collins to the position 
of University Provost and Execu-
tive Vice President for Academic 
Affairs. Collins began serving as 
acting Provost, and later interim 
Provost, shortly after former Pro-
vost Martin Philbert was placed 
on administrative leave and later 
removed amid allegations of sexual 
misconduct.

Schlissel also commented on the 

recently mandated facemask policy, 
which requires everyone on campus 
grounds to wear a face covering. 

“The research is clear that wear-

ing a face covering is one of the 
most effective tools we have for 
preventing the spread of COVID-
19 and saving lives,” Schlissel said. 
“It’s difficult to maintain distance 
from groups even when outdoors on 
a busy University campus, and so, 
face coverings outdoors will help 
slow the spread of the virus as well.” 

Schlissel said he was pleased to 

hear the Department of Homeland 
Security policy that required inter-
national students taking exclusively 
online classes to leave the U.S. was 
revoked, meaning international stu-
dents will be permitted to remain 
in the country if their classes are all 
remote. He referenced the amicus 
brief the University filed in support 
of Harvard University and Massa-

chusetts Institute of Technology’s 
lawsuit to block the regulation.

“International 
students 
are 

core members of our institutions,” 
Schlissel said. “They make valuable 
contributions in our classrooms, 
campuses and communities, con-
tributions that have helped make 
American education the envy of 
the world. International students 
contribute to a diversity of thought 
background and experience that 
promotes learning outcomes and 
better prepares students for an 
increasingly diverse workforce and 
society. We strongly disagree with 
arbitrary restrictions on interna-
tional students that might force 
them to risk their health in order to 
continue their studies.”

Twelve members from the Uni-

versity community were permit-
ted to address the regents during 
the public comment portion of the 
event. The speakers discussed the 
idea of student representation on 
the board, plans for the upcoming 
in-person semester and efforts to 
provide adequate funding to the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses. 

During the June 29 special 

Regents meeting, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel announced 
the Flint and Dearborn campuses 
would receive a shared $20 million 
fund, double the $10 million that 
was previously allocated in the bud-
get presented at the June 25 meet-
ing.

Engineering Junior Labiba Qazi, 

vice president of Dearborn Stu-
dent Government and member of 
One University, an organization 
advocating for equitable funding 
at the University’s three campuses, 
argued for transparency with the 
designated resources. Qazi empha-
sized the University should use 
the funding to prioritize students’ 
needs. She referred to a May 2020 
proposal published by 1U that called 
on the administration to extend the 
Go Blue Guarantee and Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion initiatives to 
Dearborn and Flint.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

Adrienne Lapidos commuted 

to her office for work before the 
COVID-19 pandemic began in 
Michigan. But like many oth-
ers over the past several months, 
she transitioned to working from 
home. As a clinical assistant pro-
fessor of psychiatry at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Lapidos now 
primarily sees her patients via 
video visits instead of in-person.

Though urgent cases are still 

seen in-person, Lapidos’ depart-
ment shifted to majority telemedi-
cine in late March. She told The 
Daily the change was unexpected.

“It pretty much caught all of us 

by surprise how quickly the tran-
sition happened from in-person 
to video visits,” Lapidos said. “It 
had been a really major goal to 
increase uptake of video visits this 
year, but adoption was not wide-
spread until after COVID started.”

Steven Leber, Medical Doctor 

and professor of pediatrics and 
neurology, said video visits are 
advantageous to patients in selec-
tive cases where transportation is 
a barrier. Leber added moving to 
video visits also helps with social 

distancing guidelines.

“Because of social distancing, 

we’re really limiting how many 
patients come into the clinic,” 
Leber said.

Medical School student Lauren 

Gaston-Hawkins said since medi-
cal students were given a directive 
from the Association of American 
Medical Colleges in mid-March to 
pause clinical rotations, the tran-
sition to telemedicine was a great 
idea but difficult to implement.

“At the beginning, I was some-

what neutral about the change,” 
Gaston-Hawkins said. “I thought 
it was a great opportunity to 
propel the use of telemedicine 
forward, but the transition was 
difficult since we didn’t have the 
infrastructure in place previous-
ly.”

Gaston-Hawkins 
noted 
that 

even though medical students 
weren’t incorporated in telemedi-
cine visits until June 8, she’s had 
the opportunity to help transition 
prenatal patient visits to video in 
her department since mid-March. 

Although 
telemedicine 
was 

fairly new to many clinicians, 
including Leber and Lapidos, the 
concept was pioneered by Rashid 
Bashshur, head of telemedicine 
and professor emeritus of health 
management and policy at the 
School of Public Health.

According to Bashshur, tele-

medicine was first used in 1905 by 
a Dutch physician to transmit EKG 

sounds via a telephone. Bashshur 
was commissioned by the Nation-
al Science Foundation in the early 
1970s to research the capabilities 
and viability of telemedicine.

“Interest was very meager at 

that time,” Bashshur said. “But 
I thought the idea had merit and 
we had to investigate it to find out 
what that merit was and (to) see if 
we want to proceed on that basis.”

Bashshur said inefficient and 

expensive 
technology 
initially 

made telemedicine difficult to use. 
However, once technology began 
to develop, the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services began to 
place constraints on the new con-
cept. Insurance companies did the 
same. Some restrictions, including 
only allowing patients from rural 
zip codes to use telemedicine, 
were overturned due to COVID-
19. As the pandemic began to
unravel, Bashshur said there was a 
wave of new regulations that made 
it easier for patients to access tele-
medicine resources.

“The pandemic opened the 

floodgates 
of 
telemedicine 

because we had to implement 
mitigation efforts to slow the rate 
of infection and the separation of 
people became critical,” Bashshur 
said. “In addition, keeping health 
care workers safe from the infec-
tion was important.”

Regents listen to concerns about funding, 

testing capabilities and student representation.

The pandemic opens 
up new possibilities of 
virtual doctor visits


In the fall of 1918, as midterm 

elections approached during the 
end of World War I and the second 
wave of the Spanish flu emerged in 
September, voters witnessed “the 
first masked ballot ever known in 
the history of America.” Today, 
as history so often likes to repeat 
itself, Americans are enduring sim-
ilar situations. In the midst of the 
resurgence of the Black Lives Mat-
ter movement, paired with a deadly 
pandemic that has taken the lives of 
over 143,000 individuals in the U.S. 
and a presidential election on the 
horizon, the country is scrambling 
for ways to uphold the constructs 
of constitutional democracy while 
fighting for the lives of their neigh-
bors, brothers and sisters. 

Some states, such as Michigan, 

have recently adopted new voting 
laws where anyone can now choose 
to vote via absentee ballot without 
requiring a reason. On March 10, 
2020, Michigan Secretary of State 
Jocelyn Benson said that “all of 
Michigan’s 7.7 million registered 
voters will be mailed absentee bal-
lot applications so they can take 
part in elections in August and 
November without the risk of in-
person voting if they choose to do 
so.” Benson’s office also “report-
ed a surge in new voter registra-
tion after seeing numbers drop off 
sharply during the height of the 
coronavirus outbreak in Michigan.” 
As people across the nation fear for 
their health, many are choosing 
socially-distanced voting options, if 
at all possible. Unfortunately, mail-
in voting is not a feasible option in 
many states, and Americans have 
witnessed 
countless 
individuals 

jeopardize their health in order to 
fulfill their democratic duties. 

On June 9, Georgia held its pri-

mary election with 214 fewer poll-
ing places than it had in 2013, largely 
due to the Supreme Court’s gut-
ting of significant parts of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, which allowed nine 
states to modify their election laws 
without seeking approval from the 
federal government. The state also 
introduced over $100 million worth 
of new electronic voting machines. 
Through a combination of machine 
malfunction, poor planning and a 
lack of poll workers, these machines 
did not work, leading many voters 
to wait in line for hours. In addi-
tion, not enough absentee ballots 
were distributed, leading to many 
registered voters finding them-
selves unable to vote despite having 
requested a mail-in ballot on time.

Georgia’s 
disastrous 
primary 

resulted in a textbook case of voter 
suppression, a complex, undemo-
cratic political strategy to create 
barriers or ultimately prevent eli-
gible voters from exercising their 
right to vote. Required photo ID 
and most anti-voter fraud legisla-
tion are forms of voter suppression. 

This tactic often targets people of 
color and low-income individuals. 
Many of Georgia’s polling station 
closures, as well as most of their 
machine errors on June 9, were in 
counties with large Black popula-
tions. Majority-white areas had 
notably fewer problems voting. 

Some argue that modern voter 

suppression is not an intentional 
or malicious act. Ill will is difficult 
to prove. However, voting secu-
rity measures and poorly-managed 
elections today continue to impact 
those who have already been dis-
proportionately affected by system-
ic oppression, further obstructing 
their ability to exercise fundamen-
tal democratic rights and freedoms. 
These consequences should not be 
excusable. As Lewis himself put 
it in July 2011, “Voting rights are 
under attack in America ... There’s 
a deliberate and systematic attempt 
to prevent millions of elderly voters, 
young voters, students, minority 
and low-income voters from exer-
cising their constitutional right to 
engage in the democratic process.”

As 
the 
Michigan 
primaries 

approach, the University can also 
do more to make sure students have 
the necessary resources to exercise 
their right to vote. There is a voter 
registration button on Wolverine 
Access, for example, but it is at the 
bottom of the page and only exists 
as a button on the old version of the 
site — one has to search for “voter 
registration” directly to find this 
information on the new interface. 
In a December 2019 interview from 
The Daily with University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel, when asked 
if he would consider automati-
cally registering students to vote, 
he responded, “I’d want to think 
about it more. My goal alternative-
ly is to make it as easy as possible 
for people to register and that as 
easy as possible for people to vote, 
but you still have to take personal 
responsibility.” Organizations such 
as the Ginsberg Center can pro-
mote civic engagement on campus, 
but that information is clearly not 
being disseminated well if students 
were still having trouble voting as 
recently as the March presidential 
primary. Barriers to students voting 
are likely to worsen as the COVID-
19 pandemic continues. Rep. Karen 
Bass, D-Calif., said, “I know that if 
he was still with us, he would be 
leading that fight. What we have to 
do is live up to his legacy. We need 
to continue that fight for social jus-
tice. And again, the first thing we 
need to do is pass the Voting Rights 
Act and get it signed.” Lewis — 
along with countless other selfless, 
empowering leaders today — have 
left roadmaps for us to follow in the 
fight for social justice and freedom. 

The state of Michigan’s primary 

is on Aug. 4. You have until 5 p.m. on 
July 31 to request an absentee ballot.

E

ventually, public pressure 
evoked by media circula-
tion of police brutality in 

America led to the enactment of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a 
step that empowered Black vot-
ers and ultimately led to Lewis’s 
informal title — “conscience of the 
U.S. Congress.” In a 1971 House 
testimony, Lewis stated, “We 
have to look beyond the glowing 
reports of a new South. We have 
to recognize the fallacies of those 
who would tell us that Federal 
registrars and observers are no 
longer needed. We cannot allow 
ourselves to be duped into believ-
ing that, in these so-called new 
and changing times, the Voting 
Rights Act is no longer needed.” 
Fervently, Lewis continued with, 
“There are fewer violent tactics, 
but the subtle and more sophis-
ticated forms of intimidation are 
still being devised and are quite 
prevalent.” Today, nearly half a 
century later, Americans are still 
fighting for the same freedoms.

In light of recent voter sup-

pression cases worsened by the 
consequences of the COVID-19 
pandemic, and in the spirit of 
Lewis and Vivian’s lifelong work, 
we as college students and as 
a broader community of young 
people need to prioritize and 

take advantage of our right to 
vote, especially at this moment. 
The University of Michigan has 
resources for educating students 
about where and how to vote, but 
these resources need to be more 
widely 
advertised 
and 
acces-

sible. In June 2019, Lewis stated, 
“I have said this before, and I 
will say it again. The vote is pre-
cious. It is almost sacred. It is 
the most powerful non-violent 
tool we have in a democracy.” 

Unfortunately, the ability to 

vote historically has been and 
continues to be difficult for many 
across the United States. In 1980, 
Paul Weyrich, an influential con-
servative, stated, “I don’t want 
everybody to vote ... As a matter 
of fact, our leverage in the elec-
tions quite candidly goes up as 
the voting populace goes down.” 
Most unfortunately, and thanks 
in part to a conservative advo-
cacy group founded by Weyrich, 
the GOP’s efforts to disenfran-
chise voters have been more wide-
spread and effective since the 
2010 elections. The American 
Legislative 
Exchange 
Coun-

cil — funded in part by the bil-
lionaire Koch brothers who also 
bankrolled the Tea Party — has 
been a key part in the systematic 
campaign to impede voters in 

nearly every step of the electoral 
process, and has done so success-
fully with 38 states introducing 
legislation designed to do just that. 

One of the most notable and 

recent changes to overload the 
system came in the form of requir-
ing a government-issued photo 
ID. This mandate disenfranchises 
hundreds of thousands of voters, 
the methodology of which being 
dependent on specific state leg-
islation. For example, up until 
June 2017, Texas accepted con-
cealed-weapon permits at polls, 
but not student IDs. Similarly, in 
Wisconsin, a state with roughly 
340,000 college students, student 
IDs are not sufficient for voting, 
requiring students to make mul-
tiple additional steps in order to 
cast their ballot. After Wisconsin 
implemented its new voter ID law 
in 2011, which required students 
to provide multiple forms of iden-
tification, it became one of the 
strictest states for voting and it 
was estimated that some 242,000 
students may have lacked the 
documentation required to vote 
— something that was unheard of 
even two years previously. Analiese 
Eicher, a Dane County, Wis., board 
supervisor, commented, “It’s like 
creating a second class of citi-
zens in terms of who gets to vote.”

John Lewis’ legacy and voter suppression in America
O

n July 17, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rev. C.T. Vivian, both 
giants in the fight for fairness and freedom, passed away. Lewis, a 
breathtakingly powerful figure of the Civil Rights Movement, spent his 

entire life fighting for humanity and civil rights, making voting rights a key part of 
his activism. He risked his life countless times in an effort to enfranchise voters.


I

f you’re anything like me, the 
Black Lives Matter movement 
has caused you to second guess 

everything you thought you knew 
about our country’s controversial his-
tory. I went to a small high school that 
had little to no diversity from students 
to staff, which is reflected in the gaps 
in my education. Personally, June-
teenth was a major awakening for me. 
Though June 19 was the day that the 
last enslaved people were emancipated 
in Texas, I had never heard about it 
before. I was always taught that Presi-
dent Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation 
Proclamation, along with the passage 
of the 13th amendment, ushered in 
a new era of liberty. This is just one 
example of the palpable bias that shad-
ows modern history curriculum. The 
United States history curriculum is 
long overdue for an overhaul that accu-
rately portrays our country’s history. 

In my small high school, however, 

this controversy seemed far away. 
In fact, it wasn’t uncommon to see 
someone sporting clothing that fea-
tured the Confederate flag, igno-
rant to the deeper meaning of that 
symbol. Recently, however, a debate 
has sparked regarding the display 
of Confederate flags and Confeder-
ate monuments. In cities across the 
country, Confederate statues have 
been removed, and NASCAR offi-
cially banned the Confederate flag at 
all of its events. Still, those opposed 
to the departure of this iconography 
remain adamant, urging that dis-
playing Confederate symbols only 
memorializes history and ensures it 
doesn’t repeat itself. 

The origin of these symbols seems 

to contradict this notion, as many 
Confederate statues were erected 
during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights 
movement era, in direct response 
to the tidings of Black equality in 
America. Furthermore, the Confed-
erate flag — a modern day symbol of 
white supremacy defended as a piece 
of history — was never the official 
flag of the Confederacy. It was just 
the battle flag. In addition, the flag 
wasn’t widely used until the 1940s in 
response to the emergence of ideas 
that would guide the Civil Rights 
Movement. 

But we were never taught this. We 

were never taught that the flag was 
a direct symbol of hate utilized as a 
response to the Civil Rights move-
ment. We were never taught that 
many Confederate statues were simi-
larly erected as symbols of inequal-
ity and intimidation. It is because 
we never learned these precious 
facets of history that the gravity of 
these symbols has been lost. Unfor-

tunately, this appears to be a trend: 
White authors of history curricu-
lum paint the tale of this country in 
black and white — leaving gaps on the 
canvas where the grey of our ances-
tors’ immorality should lie. Instead, 
we are taught to revere the Found-
ing Fathers, many of whom owned 
slaves, and that, while wrong, slavery 
was simply the answer to an inevi-
table need for labor in the colonies. 
While our textbooks may include a 
very basic telling of events, this tell-
ing is incredibly one-sided and fails 
to include a fuller, complex version of 
history wherein minorities perished 
at the hands of white men we have 
been taught to glorify like modern-
day gods. 

This is due in part to textbook 

information disparity created by 
partisan politics. In a phenomenon 
known as “The Texas Effect,” many 
publishers have historically based 
curriculum off of Texas standards 
because Texas has a large number 
of public schools, equating to higher 
profits for these publishers. This cur-
riculum tends to highlight Christian-
ity, downplay slavery and celebrate 
the Founding Fathers — omitting 
or manipulating vital chunks of 
our nation’s controversial history. 
When compared to California his-
tory textbooks, these inconspicuous 
differences are very telling of the 
motivations behind this twisted nar-
rative of history. These textbooks are 
intended to indoctrinate students, as 
many of these policymakers want to 
influence the upcoming generation, 
and the best way to do so is through 
education. 

The actual events of our nation’s 

past and the history we were taught 
are two very different tales. While 
the names and dates may be the same, 
the narrative diverges significantly, 
glazing over horrific atrocities while 
glorifying immoral men. The only 
cure for ignorance is education, and 
the only remedy for manipulation is 
honesty. We need a comprehensive 
reform of the curriculum to illustrate 
a candid portrait of history. Though it 
may be uncomfortable at times, it was 
Meghan Markle who said, “We’re 
going to have to be a little uncomfort-
able right now, because it’s only in 
pushing through that discomfort that 
we get to the other side of this and 
find the place where a high tide raises 
all ships.” After all, teaching an hon-
est and accurate version of history is 
the only way we can make sure that 
this history never repeats itself again.

One nation, two histories

L

ast Friday, the nation mourn-
ed the loss of one of the great-
est American civil rights 

leaders of all time. U.S. Rep. John 
Lewis, D-Ga., passed away after a bat-
tle with stage four pancreatic cancer 
at the age of 80. Before his election to 
Congress in 1986, Lewis had previous-
ly distinguished himself as a leader of 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee and a member of the “Big 
Six,” an elite group of civil rights icons 
that included Martin Luther King Jr. 
In 1963, Lewis spoke at the March 
on Washington, where King gave his 
globally famous “I Have a Dream” 
speech. From organizing protests 
nationwide and marching with Dr. 
King in the 1960s, to leading a sit-in 
on the U.S. House floor advocating for 
gun control legislation in 2016, Lewis 
is a giant whose shadow spans many 
eras in U.S. history and whose legacy 
will no doubt shine far into the future. 

Lewis passed away as the U.S. is 

grappling with one of the greatest 
civil rights struggles in recent memo-
ry: the widespread protests following 
the George Floyd killing. It is widely 
known that one of the consequences 
of this fallout has been the renewed 
debate regarding the removal of 
statues of Confederate or otherwise 
racist historical figures across the 
country. However, with the debate 
around statue removal still raging, 
it is equally important to consider 
which statues we should keep and 
which statues we should build. 

All throughout his life, Lewis 

fought for racial equality in a way con-
sistent with the values of today’s Black 
Lives Matter movement, and now 
that he has left us, it is time to immor-
talize him in marble or metal like we 
have done for so many less-deserving 
Americans. Specifically, a good place 
to start would be having a statue of 
Lewis replace the statue of Confed-
erate Vice President Alexander Ste-
phens as one of Georgia’s statues in 
the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall.

Championed by the late 19th cen-

tury Vermont senator Justin Morrill, 
who is better known for the Morrill 
Land Grant Act which helped estab-
lish public universities like Michigan 
State, the legislation calling for a Stat-
uary Hall commemorating American 
heroes was passed into law in 1864. 
The criteria for memorializing statues 
according to Morrill’s proposal is as 
follows: “deceased persons who have 
been citizens thereof, and illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distin-
guished civic or military services such 
as each State may deem to be worthy 
of this national commemoration.” 
Currently, Georgia’s two statues are 

Crawford Long, a 19th-century phy-
sician who invented the use of anes-
thetic substances during surgery, and 
the far more controversial Stephens 
who, in addition to being a leader in 
the Confederacy, was the owner of 
30+ slaves before the Civil War. 

Since John Lewis has, to the great 

sadness of so many Americans, passed 
away, it is time to remove the statue 
of Stephens and erect one that com-
memorates Lewis in the Capitol. This 
is more than a fitting proposition, as 
Lewis was known during his life as 
“the Conscience of the Congress” for 
his calm but principled leadership. In 
addition to the aforementioned gun 
control sit-in, some of Lewis’s greatest 
accomplishments in Congress include 
helping to pass the Voting Rights 
Advancement Act of 2019 through 
the House of Representatives, which 
holds individual states accountable for 
restrictive voter registration and vot-
ing practices, and co-sponsoring the 
Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights 
Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016, 
which devotes FBI and DOJ resources 
to solving civil rights-related cold cases 
for hate crimes like lynchings. 

Meanwhile, one of Stephens’s 

greatest “accomplishments” is his 
fiery Cornerstone Speech, which he 
delivered in Georgia in the weeks 
before the attack of Fort Sumter. 
This speech is credited as one of the 
clearest explanations of the Con-
federate system of government, and 
a key factor behind the galvaniza-
tion of pro-Confederate sentiment 
heading into the Civil War. In this 
speech, Stephens declared that slav-
ery — i.e. the “great truth that the 
negro is not equal to the white man” 
— was the “cornerstone” (hence the 
oration’s nickname) of the Confed-
erate States of America and that the 
“natural and moral condition” of 
Black enslavement was what made 
the Confederacy truly great. These 
are the horrifying words of the 
kind of man who would have been 
Lewis’s worst enemy. The fact that 
Georgia believes that someone 
who would say this is “worthy of 
national commemoration” is sim-
ply nauseating and in desperate 
need of rectification.

As previously stated, even as a 

young man, Lewis was constantly 
fighting for improving the treat-
ment of his own community. In 
Morrill’s own words, one of the most 
important factors behind whether 
a statue should be enshrined in 
Statuary Hall is their commitment 
to improving our democracy in 
the form of “distinguished civic … 
services.” What bigger civic duty 

is there than getting Americans to 
vote? Lewis spent much of his time 
with SNCC attempting to have 
Black Americans registered to vote 
in spite of racist poll taxes and litera-
cy tests, and his skull was even frac-
tured by Alabama police while he 
was protesting for the original 1965 
Voting Rights Act in Selma, Ala., 
near the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
In Lewis’s own words, “the right 
to vote is precious … the vote is the 
most powerful, non-violent tool we 
have in a democratic society.”

On the other hand, and this 

should not be surprising at this 
point, Stephens continued to be a 
callous racist after the Civil War 
ended. He was elected to Congress 
representing Georgia from 1873 to 
1882 and then became the gover-
nor of Georgia from 1882 until his 
death in 1883. He was influential 
in Georgia politics during a post-
Reconstruction period that saw a 
resurgence of white supremacy and 
a litany of Black voting restrictions, 
such as the 1877 poll tax require-
ment which, although abolished in 
1945, was similar to the one Lewis 
fought against decades later.

This article does not even begin 

to cover how incredible and effec-
tive John Lewis was as an activist 
and legislator. In addition to his vot-
ing rights and congressional work, 
he led legendary sit-ins against seg-
regation across the country, and was 
one of the original Freedom Riders 
protesting the segregation of bus 
stations in the South. After Lewis’s 
death, current Georgia Gov. Brian 
Kemp related a statement praising 
him as a “Civil Rights hero, freedom 
fighter, devoted public servant, and 
beloved Georgian who changed our 
world in a profound way.” 

However, while many members of 

Congress are trying to get rid of Con-
federate statues in the Capitol, currently 
only a state’s government can officially 
remove and replace that state’s statue. 
With that in mind, everything Kemp 
said about Lewis would be utterly 
hypocritical if he continued to allow 
Stephens — the anti-Lewis if there ever 
was one — to represent Georgia in the 
Capitol. If Georgians really believe that 
Lewis was a beloved member of their 
state, they need to act as soon as possible 
and purge the stain of the Confederacy 
from their public memorials, starting 
with Stephens, and end this purge with 
new memorials to the right people, like 
Congressman John Lewis.

A lot has changed since the last time we heard 

from The Chicks. They had a different name, 
different marital statuses and George W. Bush 
was still the president. The same president who 
lead singer Natalie Maines claimed she was 
“ashamed” of in 2003 — immediately sparking 
the trio’s fall from country music grace. Still, 
the group’s 2006 release Taking the Long Way 
offered no apologies for being outspoken. “I’ve 
paid a price and I’ll keep paying” Maines half-
vowed, half-predicted on the aptly titled track 
“Not Ready to Make Nice.”

Fourteen years later, Gaslighter proves 

Maines right. In detailing her tumultuous 
divorce, the album displays the personal costs 
of a commitment to candor. “My husband’s 
girlfriend’s husband just called me up / how 
messed up is that?” Maines winces on “Sleep at 
Night.” This kind of unswerving dedication to 
cataloguing the extent of Maines’s pain is what 
holds Gaslighter together. And at the same time, 
it’s what allows The Chicks to deliver the most 
scathing one-liners of their career. 

“I hope you die peacefully in your sleep / 

just kidding, I hope it hurts like you hurt me” 
Maines taunts on “Tights On My Boat.” If 
there’s one image that will now forever haunt 
Chicks fans, it’s those horrid tights on her boat 
— Gaslighter’s recurring motif and the damn-
ing evidence of Maines’s ex-husband’s infidel-
ity. Bouncing between jabs and sucker punches 
— “Will your dad pay your taxes now that I’m 
done?” — the laid-back but ominous “Tights 
On My Boat” is a deliciously petty tell-all that 
contextualizes Gaslighter’s arc. And, knowing 
that the divorce proceedings were drawn out 
over the prenup and a “confidentiality clause,” 
maybe Maines figured it was time for her ex to 
pay up too — in details.

It’s telling then, that the loneliest moment 

on the album is a cover. Originally recorded by 
singer-songwriter Charlotte Lawrence, “Every-

body Loves You” anchors Gaslighter in chilling 
disbelief. The listener gets the sense that even 
Maines couldn’t quite articulate how betrayed 
she felt — so she had to use someone else’s 
words. The song captures Maines’s recognition 
of a shade of hurt that isn’t found anywhere 
else on the record — confusion. “Why does 
everybody love you? / They don’t know enough 
about you” she sighs. Her delivery is brutal. 
There’s something special about seeing your-
self in a song that frees Maines to be vulnerable.

But what about their new sound? Known 

— and loved — for Maines’s rich harmonies 
with sisters Emily Strayer and Martie Magu-
ire alongside a generous helping of banjo and 
fiddle, The Chicks have enlisted artists to help 
launch their comeback who would make any 
country purist groan. Names include producer 
Jack Antonoff, known for his work on Taylor 
Swift’s and Lorde’s recent projects, as well as 
an assortment of pop-oriented songwriters like 
Julia Michaels and Anne Clark, who is profes-
sionally known as St. Vincent. But it works. The 
slick, sparse production matches the anger that 
pulses through the album and heightens its bit-
ing lyrics. Genre squabbles aside, banjo licks 
and studio-bred percussion are equally central 
to etching out Gaslighter’s narrative. 

From the rollicking, finger-pointing title 

track to the swampy battle cry “March March,” 
this beat-driven alteration to The Chicks’ sig-
nature sound helps keep them steady. More-
over, it’s a teaching tool. In “
Julianna Calm 

Down” The Chicks coach their daughters and 
nieces through heartbreak. “
Just put on, put 

on, put on your best shoes / and strut the fuck 
around like you have nothing to lose,” Maines 
instructs “Harper,” “Eva” and about a dozen 
other names. What starts slow and somber 
grows celebratory as the beat pushes the lis-
tener to dance.

Politics and TikToks

On July 9, the world came tumbling down 

for TikTok fanatics and Gen Zers alike. The 
app experienced an hour-long glitch causing 
the short-form videos to appear like-less and 
view-less, with users’ For You Pages displaying 
arbitrary content as opposed to the personalized 
stuff the algorithm usually generates. Before app 
representatives could assure that the outage was 
just a temporary disruption, TikTok devotees 
hysterically flooded Twitter with hashtags like 
#RipTikTok and #tiktokshutdown anticipating 
the app’s demise. Severely ill-timed, the glitch 
occurred just three days following Secretary of 
State Mike Pompeo’s alleged threat to ban the 
app due to security concerns. 

In some sort of doomsday scenario where 

the government threatens app prohibition on 
Monday and the application stops functioning 
on Thursday, TikTokers launched into survival 
mode and pivoted their focus to other platforms. 
LSA junior Ari Elkins, who has accumulated a 
following of more than 246.7 thousand on the 
app making themed music listicles, spent the 
outage trying to direct his followers to his Ins-
tagram account. Nick Daly, a Music, Theatre & 
Dance sophomore who has gained TikTok pop-
ularity by posting musical theatre covers, did the 
same as he encouraged his 71.4 thousand follow-
ers to find him on Instagram instead.

In an interview with the Daily, Elkins remem-

bered thinking “Everything I’ve put in is about to 
disappear” during the infamous glitch. Hannah 
Stater, a Music, Theatre & Dance student pursu-
ing a master’s in harp performance, has earned 
over 378.4 thousand followers and 9.1 million 
likes posting covers under the name “hannah_
harpist.” Stater told the Daily she recalled a wave 
of #RIP messages during the glitch as creators in 
her multiple group chats immediately declared 
the app dead. Within an hour, TikTok’s bug was 
sorted out, but content creators were still shaken 
by the malfunction and left uncertain about the 
app’s fate. Elkins admitted, “I did not really feel 
relieved when it got fixed. There’s always an 
idea in my head that I could wake up tomorrow 
and (TikTok) could be gone.”

A platform that has fostered political mobili-

zation and given a voice to a new generation of 
activists, artists and business owners, the ban 
could mean a lot more than just an end to viral 
dances and unfortunate “thirst traps.” To users 
like Elkins, who views his content as a supple-
ment to a career in music curation, the ban could 
translate to a severe professional setback. And 
to those like Stater or Daly, who are using their 
platforms to amplify Black and indigenous cre-
ators and distribute anti-racist resources, the ban 
could serve as a threat to free speech. So what is 
really behind the Trump administration’s sup-
posed ban on the app? Are Gen Z voices at stake?

TikTok, which has experienced a surge of 

success in recent months, currently entertains 
800 million monthly users — exceeding other 
popular platforms like Snapchat and Twitter. 

The majority of these users are between the 
ages of 16 and 24, allowing the platform to cata-
pult the voices of Gen Z into the national dia-
logue in unprecedented ways. The generation’s 
impact via TikTok reached political bounds last 
month when users banded together to botch 
attendance of Trump’s Tulsa rally through 
phony ticket sales. The app has also allowed 
Black Lives Matter protesters to push first-hand 
footage that challenges the way the protests are 
illustrated by mainstream media. 

In an interview with the Daily, Stater spoke 

on TikTok’s role in the Black Lives Matter 
movement and highlighted the generational dis-
crepancy between mainstream and social media 
protest coverage. She observed that, “Most Mil-
lennials and most Gen Z people don’t have cable, 
therefore they’re not watching the (same) news 
… that most Gen Xers and Boomers watch. In 
the wake of Breonna Taylor’s murderers still not 
having been arrested, people on the news … are 
not covering that any more. But TikTok is show-
ing videos of protests still going on … enabling 
people to question the media and question tra-
ditional news.”

Secretary of State Pompeo initially positioned 

the TikTok ban as a means of safeguarding data, 
accusing the app, currently operating under an 
American CEO, of sharing information with the 
“Chinese Communist Party.” In his proposition, 
Pompeo essentially posed all Chinese apps as a 
security threat due to the Chinese internet secu-
rity law, which would allow the Chinese gov-
ernment to request access to TikTok user data. 
However, many creators interpret the Trump 
administration’s TikTok ban as a way to hinder 
the work of Gen Zers and counteract the politi-
cal mobilization the app has stimulated.

Ari Elkins expanded on this belief, saying “I 

think the ban is a political tactic by the adminis-
tration to censor the Gen Z voices at the height 
of an election year, which ultimately I find to be 
a threat to our democracy. While, of course, you 
should definitely take safeguards on our privacy 
and data, this is a bigger issue beyond TikTok 
that should be dealt with.”

Stater shared a similar concern, stating the 

ban “will speak volumes to … where the alle-
giances of our government are in regards to … 
free speech. If they were to ever ban TikTok and 
yet they still haven’t declared the KKK as a ter-
rorist group, it just really speaks volumes to the 
government and the corruption that is at play.”

Daly believed that the ban could be working 

as both a political tactic and a genuine means of 
protecting users. He told the Daily, “I think that 
it is definitely possible that the motive behind 
the ban would be to push that anti-Chinese nar-
rative that the Trump Administration has been 
spewing. But, I also do think that it is very pos-
sible that it could be due to security reasons, 
which is also valid. It can be both, unfortunate-
ly.”

MUSIC REVIEW


Jane Austen’s “Mansfield Park” is one of 

the last books remaining from the selection 
my mother left me. Without having read an 
Austen novel prior to “Mansfield Park,” Aus-
ten has already held an influential role in my 
life. When I was little, I remember curling up 
to my mother on rainy days as we watched 
the BBC “Pride and Prejudice” series. I was 
too young to comprehend the intricacies of 
the story, yet I was able to find comfort in 
the quiet ambiance the episodes would bring 
about as well as the calm sense of safety I felt 
in my mother’s arms. 

Austen’s “Sense and Sensibility” and 

“Emma” were also familiar stories in my 
household; I still have short, but vivid, recol-
lections of specific moments in each of those 
film adaptations after peeking into my moth-
er’s room on serene summer or still winter 
days. More recently, my mother and I bonded 
over Austen’s stories as we attended the Uni-
versity of Michigan Department of Theatre 
& Drama’s beautiful production of “Sense 
and Sensibility” this past fall, and again as we 
critiqued the 2020 remake of “Emma” dur-
ing the early springtime. 

The reason I share these anecdotes is not 

to describe my pre-established relationship 
with Jane Austen, but rather to emphasize 
the fact that I was not aware of Austen’s 
“Mansfield Park” until I started reading it 
two weeks ago. I knew I had an Austen novel 
in my mother’s passed down collection, but 
I had assumed that it was “Pride and Preju-
dice” due to my mother’s particular fondness 
for the story. When I asked her why she left 
“Mansfield” instead, she promptly denied 
it. After I showed her proof of my copy, 
she then remembered why she chose it: “I 

thought it was prettier than the “Pride and 
Prejudice” copy I found.” She also revealed 
that “Mansfield” was her least favorite 
Jane Austen book. While that didn’t exactly 
encourage me to start reading, I had to read 
“Mansfield” as I don’t own a copy of “Pride 
and Prejudice,” and my mother would not let 
me borrow hers. 

“Mansfield Park” is about a young girl, 

Fanny Price, who leaves her family in Ports-
mouth to live at Mansfield Park with her 
wealthy uncle and aunt, Sir Thomas Bertram 
and Lady Bertram, and their family: the Ber-
tram daughters, Maria and Julia, who are 
both shallow and unpleasant, and the Ber-
tram sons, Tom and Edmund, the former 
who is a lavish drunk and the latter who is 
Fanny’s only friend. Fanny’s other aunt, Aunt 
Norris, also often resides at Mansfield Park. 
Apart from Edmund, the Bertrams make an 
effort to highlight their indifference to Fanny, 
for she is not a true member of the family: “ ... 
and how, without depressing her spirits too 
far, to make her remember that she is not a 
Miss Bertram.” Instead of being rightfully 
aggrieved over the numerous insults Fanny 
receives from the Bertrams (specifically her 
Aunt Norris), she accepts the insults as what 
she deserves. She believes there is fault with-
in her instead of in the treatment she faces. 

I couldn’t help but despise all the char-

acters apart from Fanny. The inconsiderate 
characterizations made reading the book a 
difficult task, and for the first third of the 
book I was unenthusiastic about picking it 
up. The language was another factor that 
influenced my indifference; however, as I 
read the language and familiarized myself 
with the style, it became easy to understand.

In late May, superstar ballerina Maria 

Kochetkova posted a ghostly photo of the 
Berliner Ensemble theatre on her Instagram: 
An aerial shot of what was supposed to be the 
audience’s thicket of red velvet seats was now 
an otherworldly scene of deforestation. Every 
third or fourth seat had been unbolted and 
ripped from the ground, leaving socially dis-
tant pods of one and two-seat arrangements 
scattered across the floor. The photo was 
originally posted on the Berliner’s Instagram 
account with a caption that translated to “the 
new normal,” but Kochetkova’s thoughts 
proved more striking: “Why are the theaters 
forced to do this,” she wrote, “and not the air-
lines?” 

The controversy began immediately: Some 

praised Kochetkova for making a political 
statement, others accused her of advocating 
for the violation of health codes. In reality, 
her question fell into neither category and 
the curiosity was well-founded. Like in the-
atres, airplane passengers sit in seats next to 
each other, wrestling over elbow room and 
breathing each other’s exhales. While the 
similarities may end there, it’s an experience 
with substantial physical crossover, much 
of which bodes poorly for the prevention of 
virus transmission. In response to the loom-
ing pandemic, most airlines limited their 
seating capacities, and most theatres faced 
complete shutdowns. This disparity was 
borne less out of malice and more out of our 
evaluation of what is and is not essential dur-
ing a health crisis. At the crest of COVID-19’s 
wave, these questions about essentialness are 
fairly easy to assess: No one needs a night at 
the ballet, though some may still need to fly. 
As we attempt to surf the wave’s crash, how-
ever, these evaluations of essentialness ripple 
and foam in a long series of complications. 
Kochetkova’s question may have appeared 
oversimplified because she posted it while we 
were at the undulation’s crest — I’d argue she 
was actually trying to ride the wave all the 
way to shore. 

The Arts and Culture sector of the United 

States employs more than five million people 
and adds $877 billion to the economy every 
year. Wrapped up in this are the millions of 
dancers, performing artists and backstage 
workers that continue to live without pay-
checks. The Transportation and Warehous-
ing sector adds only $612 billion. Wrapped up 
in this are the airline crews that continue to 
fly planes. Together, the two sectors make up 
half of the top four most profitable industries 
in America — on the eve of a global economic 
meltdown, it should seem obvious that our 
survival thus relies on the support of both 

groups. 

Our government recognized only half of 

this argument: In March, the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act allo-
cated $50 billion in 11 major U.S. Airlines. The 
money allowed planes to continue facilitating 
travel at socially-distanced seating capaci-
ties. Broadly, it allowed the Transportation 
and Warehousing sector to continue serving 
our economy. The same legislation allocated 
only $75 million (not billion) to the thousands 
of arts organizations in need. In June, New 
York City Ballet canceled “The Nutcracker” 
because it was not financially feasible for 
them to stage a production at socially-dis-
tanced seating capacity. Broadly, they do 
not have the support to continue serving our 
economy. Come December, there will be no 
audiences buying tickets. No families will 
splurge on merchandise and no couples will 
buy food at nearby restaurants before the 
show. NYCB will lose millions — the city and 
country will lose even more.

In response to this danger, the Be An Arts 

Hero campaign began advocating for the U.S. 
Senate to pass Arts relief by August 1. Their 
website makes six main demands: extend 
unemployment through December, provide 
subsidies to arts workers for COBRA health 
insurance, dedicate stimulus packages that 
are proportional to the economic contribu-
tions of the Arts and Culture sector, distrib-
ute that relief as quickly as possible, extend 
paycheck protection to government non-
profits and update the tax deduction laws 
for creative professionals. The August dead-
line is not arbitrary — the last week of July 
marks the last week of federal unemployment 
checks provided by the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief and Economic Security Act, a lifeline 
that has kept tens of millions of Americans 
alive for the past four months. As we surf 
into the end of summer, Congress appears 
depressingly confused about the danger 
of ending such support: Our country is not 
reopening; the places that have tried now 
face deadly new spikes of virus transmission. 
Artists — especially performing artists — are 
still out of work. So are retail workers, restau-
rant waiters and even many transportation 
employees. In many ways, the United States is 
no safer than we were in March. This is espe-
cially true for creative professionals, many of 
whom belong to companies who have already 
announced complete shutdowns until at least 
January. Ending federal support now is not 
only misguided, it adds fuel to an already 
blazing false narrative about this country’s 
ability to safely reopen.

Kellon Yaani Kellon

Disclaimer: *names have been abbreviat-
ed in order to ensure the privacy of the iden-
tities involved
In October 2019, the people of Lebanon 
began to fill the streets chanting “kellon 
yaani kellon,” which translates to “all of 
them means all of them.” All of them, refer-
ring to the corrupt sectarian government 
officials who have prioritized their own 
greed over providing the Lebanese people 
with fundamental aid and services for years, 
leaving Lebanon to be the third most indebt-
ed country in the world. Lebanon has a debt 
to GDP ratio of 152 percent, and has over 75 
percent of its population living below the 
poverty line. The country is without a stable 
economy, stable electricity, waste manage-
ment services and food security for no rea-
son other than the government’s inherent 
greed. When the Lebanese people chant, 
“kellon yaani kellon,” it is intended to leave 
no question that all politicians, whether 
the president or a cabinet member, are the 
problem. As long as the current ideologies 
perpetuated through political power persist, 
Lebanon will be stuck in an eternal cycle of 
corruption. 
Years of a broken economic system, char-
acterized by corruption and heavy reliance 
on imports, the pegging of the Lebanese cur-
rency to the US dollar and a diaspora which 
endlessly pumps cash into a fragile banking 
system, has inevitably led to the toppling of 
Lebanon’s economy. In recent months, the 
Lebanese currency has crashed and prices 
have skyrocketed, creating a disappearing 
middle class and further distress on the poor. 
Over 49 percent of Lebanon’s population (6.8 
million) are food insecure, and with the price 
of grocery staples doubling, or even tripling, 
low income people are destitute. Some par-
ents have to decide if they are going to buy 
formula or diapers — as there is no way for 
them to afford both.

out her whole life, including the civil war, 

How the ‘waiting game’ 
suppressesSouthAsian 
voters

AAKASH RAY
MiC Staff Writer

Graphic by Hibah Chughtai

In early December, The South Asian 
Awareness Network, a student organization 
on campus, provided me the opportunity to 
meet Ranjeev Puri— a Democratic candidate 
running for State Representative for Michi-
gan House 21. This was the first time I had 
ever met a South Asian running for a political 
position, although I knew of a few nationally 
such as Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and 
former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Teem-
ing with eagerness, I went on to ask him a 
few questions, picking his brain about South 
Asians in government and topics like civic 
participation and education.
Ranjeev spoke at length about his back-
ground growing up in Wisconsin as a sec-
ond-generation American to two immigrant 
parents and his work for former President 
Barack Obama in 2012. Yet, what I remember 
most was when he noted that South Asians 
have not historically been a large part of the 
political atmosphere in the United States. 
He left that day encouraging us to fulfill our 
civic duty and inspired me to think more 
about the South Asian community from a 
historical perspective.
While I believe there is certainly a culture 
of passivity within the South Asian com-
munity when it comes to civic engagement, 
I also believe that there are certain systemic 
barriers that have decreased the civic par-
ticipation of immigrants in subtle ways. 
Many of us know of the typical forms of 
voter suppression, including gerrymander-
ing districts, strict voter-ID laws and even 
purging voters. But, I believe there is addi-
tional widespread voter suppression by the 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 
which currently has an immense backlog of 
applications for legal residence and natural-
ization applications.

Naturalization is the process by which 
U.S. citizenship is granted to a foreign citi-
zen after they fulfill the requirements estab-
lished by Congress in the Immigration and 
Nationality Act. According to Boundless 
Immigration, “the processing time for a citi-
zenship application has surged over the past 
two years to over 10 months—double the pro-
cessing time between 2012 and 2016.” This is 
expected to continue to rise as the govern-
ment continues to keep their processing effi-
ciency stays at an incredibly low level. On top 
of this, there are steep application fees for 
naturalization — becoming a citizen — such 
as civics and English tests which must be 
completed. In lieu, many instead decide to 
renew their permanent residency for 10 more 
years and avoid risking hundreds of dollars 
just to be denied citizenship.
To give a local context, The University of 
Southern California-Dornsife Center for the 
Study of Immigrant Integration provides 
data on the number of people eligible to nat-
uralize in the United States. In Washtenaw 
County, they estimate that there are 8,458 
lawful permanent residents, or “green card” 
holders, who are eligible to apply for citizen-
ship. Of this population, about 54 percent of 
lawful permanent residents in Washtenaw 
County identify as Asian.
According to the database, if naturalized, 
these individuals would make up roughly 3.3 
percent of the citizen voting age population. 
This means close to 1 out of every 25 voters 
is being denied their constitutional right 
to engage in our democracy in Washtenaw 
County.
The “waiting game” and the subsequent 
pressure of the unknown not only holds 
South Asians back from being civically 
engaged, but also inhibits them from pursu-
ing certain jobs, scholarships and loans.

told The Daily the economic collapse has left 
Lebanon in the worst state she has ever seen. 
“During the civil war, we were mostly 
scared of bombings,” HK said. “We had hope 
that the war would end. Now, we are scared 
of tomorrow and we cannot see hope.” 
Lack of hope, a shared sentiment among 
the Lebanese, is reasonable, given the little 
to no aid the government is providing for the 
people. The government has failed to reim-
burse hospitals, making it impossible to pay 
staff and buy medical supplies, exacerbating 
the effects of COVID-19. 
“COVID-19 is a problem, like it is every-
where in the world, but it is not our main 
problem,” HK said. “The economy is our big-
gest problem.” 
Videos have surfaced of pregnant women 
eating from dumpsters and mothers on the 
streets offering to sell their organs to feed 
their children. Among those belonging to the 
most vulnerable communities are Syrian ref-
ugees— 30 percent of Lebanon’s population. 
Over 87 percent of the refugees lack food, 73 
percent lack a permanent home and each one 
of them are at devastating odds against Leb-
anon’s economic crisis and COVID-19. 
“With all the suffering going on, the gov-
ernment is not doing anything,” HK said. 
“We need a government that cares about 
their people — both the poor and the rich 
people.”
Although the economic crisis hits the poor 
the hardest, those with economic stability 
are still affected. Banks are limiting with-
drawals and those who have bank accounts 
in dollars are getting paid in liras — which 
are worth nothing. 
“I went to the supermarket and spent 
around half a million liras. That bought me 
hardly anything, basically nothing,” HK said. 
Like most of Lebanon’s public services, 
electricity is poorly provided through a 
government-owned 
company. 
Electricite 
du Liban, the state power company, cannot 
afford to purchase enough...

A way to understand: banana leaves

A few weeks ago, I was intro-

duced to “Ugly Delicious,” a Netf-
lix TV series hosted by American 
restaurateur, David Chang. In the 
series, Chang follows the history, 
culture and cooking which goes 
into dishes across the world, rang-
ing from shrimp and crawfish, to 
fried rice to steak. As a huge fan 
of travel-food shows, like “Antho-
ny Bourdain: No Reservations,” I 
envy people like Chang’s ability to 
explore cultures, new regions and 
new types of people through the 
cuisine they eat, and to share this 
with wider, sometimes more cul-
turally isolated audiences. 

Food is a core pillar of my fam-

ily and my identity. Ever since I 
was young, I was taught to cherish 
the art of eating, cooking and the 
beauty in sharing the incredible 
feelings emitted by said food with 
those around you. Food has always 
been more than nourishment for 
me — it’s a hobby, a way I build 
relationships and a passport into 
new perspectives and cultures. 
So as I watched Chang’s series, I 
began to appreciate the intricacies 
and calculations behind seemingly 
simple foods, like pizza or fried 
rice, and the fondness, history and 
attachment tied to larger cultural 
cuisines I’ve never explored before.

In Season 2, Episode 2, “Don’t 

Call it Curry,” Chang explores the 
roots of Indian cuisine, primar-

The compounding evidence of 

Euro-American 
crimes 
against 

Brown and Black populations is 
slowly eroding the white monolith, 
revealing the structure on which 
said monolith was formed — a 
structure of hatred, oppression,

on all accounts. So why is it pre-
sumed people must adhere to the 
same laws and regulations which 
made the looting of Black and 
Brown lives and identities legal?

to present day political looting, is 
what I aim to illuminate.

Americans. After white America 
learned to survive on Native land, 
they began using tactics to sys-
tematically dehumanize Black and 
Brown populations. The Indian 
Removal Act of 1830 stands as a 
watershed moment in history by 
which Native populations were 
forced off their ancestral lands and 
forced into lands that were slowly 
encroached upon as well. This can 
be observed as the impetus for the 
systemic removal of Natives from 
American nationhood — rational-
izing their subjugation and geno-
cide to the major population. In 
this sense, colonial America can be 
viewed as hollowing out the shell 
of the Native American nation.

ily due to the American public’s 
general unfamiliarity with it. He 
admits he’s never made Indian food 
at home and is quite complexed by 
it. Why? Chang has no explana-
tion. But he goes on to admit there 
is some barrier Indian food has yet 
to break within the United States. 
It hasn’t fully become mainstream; 
you don’t see many quick, mod-
ern Indian chains, hear common 
discussions of Indian recipes in 
food blogs and papers, nor is there 
an understanding by the average 
American of what Indian food is. 
The most frustrating aspect of 
Indian cuisine in America is the 
lack of representation of all Indian 
cuisine across the entire nation.

Padma Lakshmi (host of “Top 

Chef,” and a guest of the episode) 
struck a chord with me, by noting 
the way Indian food is presented in 

America is as if you were to group 
Europe into one big country, and 
refer to Italian, French, Spanish 
cuisine all as “European.” India 
is diverse, scattered and regional-
ized. Each state has its own lan-
guage, variations in culture and 
slight differences in religion and 
cuisines. The Indian food most 
typically represented in America 
— butter chicken, chicken tandoori 
— belongs to a single Indian state, 
Punjab. And extending from here, 
other popular foods such as naan, 
samosas, paneer, korma, belong 
to North Indian cuisine. India is a 
country with over a billion people, 
so flavors are infinite. 

My family is from Kerala, one of 

the most southern Indian states. 
Here, cuisine greatly varies from 
the Northern style and is much less 
represented in American dining. 

There is more of a stew-like, drier 
presentation featuring curries and 
a variety of vegetables. Other than 
these curries (and many others), 
there are tasty fried foods like idli, 
vadas, pappadams and dosa. Dosas, 
being the most popular in my opin-
ion, are a staple of Southern Indian 
households. They are often likened 
to be the “Indian crepe” and have 
gained slight popularity in larger 
cities and smaller pop-up shops. 

But even within South India, and 

Kerala, there are variations. While 
I adore and crave many dishes from 
Kerala, which resemble greater 
South Indian cooking, when think-
ing about the art of eating from my 
homeland, I think of banana leaves. 
Used often for weddings, larger 
religious events and special occa-
sions, banana leaves are represen-
tative of a savvy, traditional and 

nostalgic medium to eat food — it’s 
the world’s natural plate. The large, 
thick, light green leaf is inexhaust-
ible and crisp, and was a perfect 
way in the past and present to serve 
food. Keeping the tip of the leaf on 
the right side, and the larger side on 
the right, small subtleties mark the 
“correct” way to eat from a banana 
leaf. But first, food is served. 

When thinking about banana 

leaves, I think about sadhyas, 
which essentially means “feast” in 
Malayalam. These banquet type 
lunches are common for weddings, 
important birthdays, and religious 
celebrations — they are usually 
quite a production. Picture a large, 
open-space room with roughly 
one to two hundred guests sitting 
at long wooden tables side by side 
with banana leaves placed in front 
of them. Caterers come out in this 
synchronized, almost rehearsed 
movement — they know what to do, 
they’ve done this for sadhyas over 
and over. In tubs, they go down the 
lines of tables and serve very small 
portions of various foods onto the 
banana leaves one by one. Some-
times they ask if you want the serv-
ing or not, but before you can even 
answer, the serving is placed in a 
little circle on your leaf, and the 
offererer has passed onto the next 
guest.

First comes pickle. There are 

two types of pickle that may come 
— one, a raw mango pickle...

of the genocidal movement that 
often goes unexplored and ignored. 

Due to their culture being rooted 

in collectivism rather than indi-
vidualism — as is seen in Western 
societies — I stand in my belief that 
Native Americans, having the same 
ability as white Americans, would 

not have committed such horrific 
crimes to humankind, but I digress. 

The magnitude of white Ameri-

ca’s crimes against humanity have 
far exceeded affordability — the 
petty theft involved in looting is 
a nominal cost to pay. Today, the 
modern day movement has the 

capacity to illuminate the existence 
of a power hierarchy that places the 
fruits of capitalism above the lives 
of the marginalized fractions of 
society.

Questions to answer with Big Ten-only schedule

For months — really, since 

the 
NCAA 
Men’s 
Basketball 

Tournament 
was 
canceled 
on 

March 12 — it’s been clear that this 
upcoming college football season 
would be anything but normal. 
And on Thursday afternoon, the 
Big Ten gave the first glimpse at 
what abnormal could look like for 
its 14 members, announcing that 
fall sports will be contested entirely 
in-conference, if they happen at all.

“If the Conference is able to 

participate in fall sports based 
on medical advice, it will move to 
Conference-only schedules in those 
sports,” the conference said in a 
statement. “Details for these sports 
will be released at a later date, while 
decisions on sports not listed above 
will continue to be evaluated. By 
limiting competition to other Big 
Ten institutions, the Conference will 
have the greatest flexibility to adjust 
its own operations throughout the 
season and make quick decisions in 
real-time based on the most current 
evolving medical advice and the 
fluid nature of the pandemic. 

“This decision was made following 

many 
thoughtful 
conversations 

over several months between the 
Big Ten Council of Presidents and 
Chancellors, Directors of Athletics, 
Conference Office staff, and medical 
experts including the Big Ten Task 
Force 
for 
Emerging 
Infectious 

Diseases and the Big Ten Sports 
Medicine Committee.”

Of course, the Big Ten’s decision 

today may not be its decision 
tomorrow — a lesson ingrained back 
in March, when every day came 
with a new announcement until it 
all came crumbling down less than 
a week after the first dominos began 
to fall. But for now, the conference’s 
plan is to play an undisclosed 
number 
of 
conference 
games 

against 
undisclosed 
opponents 

on an undisclosed schedule. It’s a 
plan designed for fluidity, which 
inherently lends itself to more 
questions than answers.

So, here are some questions and 

thoughts to consider as the dust 
settles on the Big Ten’s plan:

The word “if” is carrying a lot of 

weight

The very first sentence of the 

Big Ten’s statement reads, “If the 
Conference is able to participate in 
fall sports based on medical advice, 
it will move to Conference-only 
schedules in those sports.”

That’s no small caveat. New daily 

COVID-19 cases are rising week-
over-week in 45 states, including all 
11 states with Big Ten schools. And 
while no Big Ten state is in the top 10 
in new cases this week — leaving it 
in a better position than every other 
Power Five conference — there have 
still been 5,925 cases per day this 
week in Big Ten states. That’s more 
than all but five other countries. It 
also means that the likelihood of 
football season happening at all is 
dwindling by the day.

Just 
take 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 

statement yesterday.

“My thoughts would be, it’s a 

different conversation if there’s no 
students on campus,” Harbaugh 
said. “If students are on campus, 
then my personal belief as a parent 
of a daughter who would also be on 
campus that this is a safe place.”

That conversation could become 

the norm in the coming weeks. 
While Michigan remains committed 
to having some in-person instruction 
in the fall, dozens of other schools 
have begun to move in the other 
direction. That includes Harvard 
and Princeton, two schools that 
were among the leaders in moving 
online in the spring. It also includes 
Rutgers, 
potentially 
eliminating 

one scheduled opponent from the 
Wolverines’ docket.

So while the Big Ten’s statement 

today indicates it hopes to hold fall 
sports, the reality is far less rosy. 
But even if the season does happen 
in some capacity, there are plenty of 
questions to answer, including…

What happens to the postseason?
The Big Ten isn’t the only 

conference to reportedly be moving 

to a fully in-conference schedule, 
with the ACC and Pac-12 both doing 
the same, according to multiple 
reports. And considering the rapid 
escalation of new cases in Florida 
and Texas, it seems likely that the 
SEC and Big 12 will soon follow suit.

Through November, that could 

lend itself to a season that looks 
relatively normal. But the College 
Football Playoff, unlike the 2012 
BCS 
National 
Championship, 

isn’t contested within individual 
conferences. 
Neither 
are 
bowl 

games.

And while bowl games could 

be canceled without harming the 
integrity of the season, the same 
can’t be said of the CFP. During the 
last pandemic on this scale in 1918, 
no traditional bowl games were 
held and there was no consensus 
national champion. It’s hard to 
imagine following that blueprint 
with the financial and competitive 
implications of modern-day college 
football.

But any method of crowning a 

national champion means playing 
non-conference games, even if it’s 
just three games between four teams 
in early January. And the feasibility 
of that is hazy at best, especially with 
some schools taking an extended 
winter break to avoid heavy flu 
season.

What is the financial impact 

of canceled ‘buy games’ for small 
schools?

The 
Wolverines 
have 
three 

canceled 
non-conference 
games. 

One of those is the first leg of a 
home-and-home with Washington. 
Regardless of whether that game is 

ever made up, the Huskies will be 
fine financially, both because of their 
operating budget and because that 
game wasn’t constructed primarily 
as a financial agreement.

The same can’t be said of Ball 

State and Arkansas State.

The Wolverines were slotted 

to pay Ball State $975,000. The 
Arkansas State game was even 
pricier, at $1.8 million — a contract 
that included a clause accounting for 
“an act of God.” That likely means 
Michigan will be able to get out of 
paying both Ball State and Arkansas 
State to help mitigate its own 
financial losses.

Small schools such as Ball State 

and Arkansas State, though, don’t 
have the massive television contracts 
and booster donations to soften a 
multi-million dollar hit, especially 
when they’re already losing six 
games of gate revenue.

What happens to Notre Dame?
On the opposite end of the FBS 

spectrum from Ball State and 
Arkansas State, we have Notre 
Dame. The Fighting Irish, with their 
$150 million contract with NBC, will 
be fine financially.

But if every conference limits 

itself to in-conference games, what 
becomes of the nation’s foremost 
independent?

The answer, as of right now, 

seems to be that the Irish will be 
looped into the ACC’s conference 
games. Like everything else, though, 
that plan is in a state of limbo. And 
even if it holds, it could have long-
term ramifications for Notre Dame, 
the ACC and the Big Ten, causing the 
Irish to continue their recent drift 

from the Big Ten toward the ACC.

In the short term, Notre Dame 

will only have to reschedule its 
Oct. 3 game with Wisconsin — an 
unexpected benefit of its recent 
move to only playing one Big Ten 
opponent per season.

How will conference schedules 

unfold?

According to multiple reports, the 

most likely scenario for the Big Ten 
is that teams will move to playing 
10 conference games, up from the 
normally-scheduled 
nine. 
That 

alteration, though, could manifest 
itself in a number of different ways.

The biggest issue could come 

if Rutgers — or any other school 
— decides it’s unsafe to play while 
the rest of the conference goes on 
as planned. What, in that scenario, 
would Michigan do on Nov. 14 when 
it’s scheduled to travel to Piscataway 
while the rest of the Big Ten is busy 
with 
their 
previously-scheduled 

games?

And then there’s the problem 

of figuring out which schools will 
face each other in their 10th games, 
if that proposal comes to pass. The 
easy solution would be to add one 
team from the opposite division 
and call it a day. But the conference 
may decide to re-shuffle its schedule 
to minimize travel. On Oct. 3, for 
example, Minnesota is scheduled 
to travel to Maryland, an 1100-mile 
trip. The conference could cancel 
those games and attempt to match 
East division teams to their nearest 
West counterparts, and vice versa.

Even if all of those issues are 

resolved, conferences will still have 
to decide when these games are 
to be played. Most Big Ten games 
begin Week 4, after a trio of non-
conference games. But there are 
some exceptions, such as Indiana’s 
Week 1 trip to Wisconsin.

So will all conference games be 

moved into a coordinated 11-week 
block, giving each team a bye? And if 
so, when would that block be?

The schedule could run from late 

September to the weekend after 
Thanksgiving, but many schools 
are moving to remote classes after 
Thanksgiving. Alternatively, it could 
be moved up a week to avoid having 
athletes on campus when no other 
students are — a moral line the Big 
Ten might not want to cross. If the 
conference Championship Game 
remains in place, the schedule 
could move forward by two weeks, 
creating a quandary on the other end 
as athletes rush to get game-ready in 
an abbreviated offseason.

Whatever the Big Ten decides, 

though, one thing is clear: today’s 
decision is only the beginning of the 
conference’s troubles.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com SPORTS

As Michigan regroups for the fall, a new reality sets in

The Michigan volleyball team 

barely had barely begun its spring 
season when an ill-fated email 
landed in Mark Rosen’s inbox on the 
morning of March 12.

Mark wasn’t sure what to make of 

the note, which merely specified the 
date and time of a required call for 
all University head coaches. When 
he first read the email, it appeared 
the biggest problem would be the 
fact that the call conflicted with his 
team’s practice. 

And so, while players began 

trickling into Cliff Keen Arena for 
what they thought would be a run-
of-the-mill 
Thursday 
afternoon 

practice, Mark retreated to his office 
to join the mandatory call while 
associate head coach Leisa Rosen 
— who handles the majority of the 
team’s training anyway — began 
practice.

Little did he know, it was the last 

time he’d leave the gym with any 

sense of normalcy.

As the call began, Michigan athletic 

director Warde Manuel didn’t mince 
words. The Big Ten was suspending 
all athletic activities, prompting an 
immediate intervention from Mark.

“My team is practicing right now,” 

Mark told The Daily. “What should 
we do?”

Manuel’s response left no room for 

interpretation:

“As soon as we get off the call, shut 

it down.”

Moments later, Mark re-entered 

the gym, taking in his final glimpse of 
volleyball before the world would be 
turned on its head. The Wolverines 
were in the middle of a drill when 
Leisa made eye contact with Mark, 
whose facial expression and body 
language told her everything she 
needed to know.

The players finished the drill and 

made their way to the team room, 
where Mark delivered the news.

“I think (the players) kind of 

knew,” Mark recalled. “Since I wasn’t 
in practice, they knew that probably 

wasn’t a good sign. I just said, ‘Hey, 
this is what’s going on. This is the 
situation. We don’t really know a 
whole lot, but we’re not going to 
practice until further notice.’ ”

As players filed out, a warranted 

sentiment of uncertainty hung in the 
air. Since that moment, the Rosens 
and Wolverines have yet to reconvene 
as a team. In his 21 years at the helm of 
the Wolverines’ volleyball program, 
Mark has never lived through 
anything like the last four months.

But now, 130 days later, there’s a 

light at the end of the tunnel. And 
as Michigan inches closer to its 
conference-only season, the athletic 
department’s return-to-sport plan is 
at the forefront of it all. 

“It’s a pretty specific protocol,” 

Mark said Thursday. “I’m super 
proud of our department. We have a 
few specific people in our department 
who are in charge of a few certain 
areas like facilities or medical. I 
thought they were pretty good before 
(the pandemic), but they’re rockstars. 
They are really good at what they do. 

You see that in whatever profession — 
when the pressure’s on and it’s a dire 
situation, that’s when you see who’s 
really good.”

Mark singled out senior associate 

athletic director Darryl Conway as the 
mastermind behind Michigan’s plan 
to monitor athletes’ exposure, testing 
and resocialization process. And even 
though nothing is mandatory until 
the Wolverines’ formal report day on 
August 10, many volleyball players 
have voluntarily returned to Ann 
Arbor and committed to the athletic 
department’s guidelines.

But even with a plan in place, the 

seemingly endless list of wildcards 
remains daunting.

“That whole process is going about 

as smooth as it could, but there’ll be 
a lot of hiccups,” Mark said. “One 
of the things I’ve learned through 
this process is that you have to be 
flexible and you have to understand 
that things are going to change. 
They literally change by the minute 
almost.”

A few weeks ago, Mark lived 

through an example of just that.

“We were on a call one time with 

all our coaches and administrators,” 
Mark recalled. “They mentioned a 
date and a time at the beginning of 
the meeting, and by the middle of 
the meeting that date had changed. 
I was like, ‘Wait, what happened?’ 
They said, ‘Oh, yeah, while we’re on 
this call, things changed.’ That’s what 
we’ve got to expect. It’ll change really 
rapidly.”

For now, it’s full steam ahead. As 

of July 17, just eight of the 635 total 
student-athletes and staffers in Ann 
Arbor have tested positive for COVID-
19. Yet, even as the Wolverines move 
forward under strict guidelines and 
cautious optimism, Mark knows 
that anything is possible in this new 
reality.

“We know our plans might get 

blown up any minute,” Mark said. 
“We have to be ready for that.”

With fall sports on the horizon, doubt lingers for Mark Rosen

As the fall sports season inches 

closer, dominoes are beginning to 
fall.

All across the country last week, 

conferences canceled their fall sports 
seasons. The Ivy League was the 
first Division I conference to cancel 
fall athletics. The Patriot League, 
Atlantic 10 and Mid-Eastern Athletic 
Conference all followed suit, while 
others, like the Big Ten, announced 
the enforcement of conference-only 
fall schedules.

Within Ann Arbor’s Cliff Keen 

Arena, the Michigan volleyball team 
is keeping tabs on those dominoes. 
Though the team won’t formally 
report for its preseason until Aug. 
10, many players have already 
voluntarily made their way back to 
Ann Arbor.

And as head coach Mark Rosen 

enters his 22nd year at the helm, a 
telling realization has set in.

“Coaches 
and 
athletic 

administrators, 
we’re 
planners,” 

Rosen said Thursday in an inerview 
with The Daily. “It’s what we do. 
We plan all the time. We plan for 
matches, we plan for practices, we 

plan everything. This is such a weird 
time because you plan, but you really 
don’t know what you’re planning for. 
So, as we’re going through this and 
we’re trying to create schedules and 
plans, we’ve kind of realized that 
there’s a lot of different pathways 
this could take.

“There’s been a lot of discussion 

about 
the 
fall 
being 
canceled 

potentially. 
So 
when 
those 

conferences did it, I don’t think I 
was surprised, but it certainly makes 
you realize this whole thing could 
be tumbling down pretty quickly. 
We just have to be understanding of 
that, we just have to know that’s a 
possibility.”

With the preseason on the 

horizon, the looming uncertainty 
casts an increasingly long shadow 
with each passing day. During the 
Wolverines’ team Zoom call on 
Wednesday, that all-encompassing 
sentiment lingered throughout the 
call.

“You just sense, every time we 

talk, (the players) are positive, 
they’re 
upbeat, 
they’re 
excited, 

they’re working hard, but there’s this 
little thread of doubt or negativity of 
what could happen,” Rosen said. “I 
think they’re handling it super well, 
but it’s hard. It’s hard to have that 

doubt. Everybody really, really wants 
to have a season, but we don’t know 
what’s going to happen.”

Since Michigan’s spring season 

was abruptly cut short on March 12 
as a result of the Big Ten’s decision 
to suspend all athletic activities, the 
program has not convened in person. 
Some players left campus when the 
University transitioned to virtual 
learning, while others remained in 
Ann Arbor — despite the closure of 
team facilities.

Through it all, one of Rosen’s 

program pillars has prevailed.

“I’ve been impressed with how 

they’re focused on the things we can 
control and not focused on the things 
we can’t control,” Rosen said. “We 
talk about that in our program all the 
time even in a normal year because 
we think that’s a really healthy way 
to look at life, but I think they’ve 
really been very good about that 
because we know there are so many 
things outside our control right now.”

But they can’t control what’s going 

on in the country. As the COVID-19 
pandemic rages on, each passing day 
plays a role in determining the fate of 
fall sports. And right now, things are 
trending in the wrong direction.

According to Stadium’s Brett 

McMurphy, NCAA President Mark 

Emmert told the NCAA Council fall 
championships would “likely” be 
canceled if a decision needed to be 
made on July 16. With a final decision 
coming in the near future, that doubt 
appears warranted.

“Three weeks ago or two weeks 

ago, I would’ve been like, ‘Hey, this 
is going in a really good direction,’ ” 
Rosen said. “And now all of a sudden, 
this last week, it hasn’t been so good, 
so you just don’t know.

“… It’s interesting because it’s 

changing so often. People think one 
standard is good enough and as you 
continue through it, you’re like, ‘Hey, 
wait, we’ve got to raise that standard.’ 
So, I think everybody’s very open.”

But even as the optics change 

quickly, the bottom line remains 
intact.

“Whatever the best science tells 

us,” Rosen said, “we’re going to do 
that.”

‘M’ football parents express worry over testing

Despite being optimistic about 

conference-only play, Chris and 
Mya Hinton still have concerns. So, 
with two sons currently in college 
football programs — Myles at 
Stanford and sophomore defensive 
lineman Chris Jr. at Michigan — the 
Hintons have chosen to be vocal.

Tuesday night, Chris and Mya 

appeared on HBO’s Real Sports 
with Bryant Gumbel and expressed 
their grievances about the approach 
the NCAA and college football 
programs have taken to reintroduce 
players to campus and practices.

“As a parent of a student athlete, 

actually, it pissed me off,” Chris said 
on Real Sports.

“... Why can’t there be some kind 

of universal procedures, protocol, 
for integrating our sons back to 
campus?”

This comes after the Hintons 

appealed to the NCAA, expressing 
their concerns. They said they 
received a dismissive response 
back, and the most frustrating part 
is the lack of input from players and 
their parents that the NCAA has 
allowed.

“The players, who probably have 

as much to lose as anybody, had no 

voice, were voiceless,” Chris said. 
“And as parents, we felt the same as 
the kids — we were voiceless.”

In an attempt to have parents’ 

voices heard, Chris and Mya 
founded 
the 
Facebook 
group 

College 
Football 
Parents 
24/7. 

There, parents could express the 

concerns many of them shared.

What it all comes down to is 

simple, safety:

“We just want it to be done right 

and safely,” Chris told The Daily last 
week. “We want our sons to be safe, 
as any other parent would want.”

While 
the 
Hintons 
have 

expressed they felt Michigan has 
handled COVID-19 well in the 
past, their tone and demeanor on 
Tuesday night’s program told a 
different story. They were upset, 
they were scared and there wasn’t 
much sense of optimism coming 
from them.

And while their primary concern 

is about safety, their frustration 
is kindled by what they see as the 
reasoning behind bringing the 
students back — money.

College 
football 
generates 

billions of dollars a year, and their 
two 
sons’ 
programs 
generate 

over 200 million dollars a year 
combined. For Chris and Mya, that 
money isn’t worth risking their 
children’s health, especially when 
the universities aren’t even willing 
to let their own staff on campus.

“The optics of that is alarming,” 

Chris said. “What does it say about 
your concern about our kids, our 
sons?”

And while the Ivy League and 

other smaller leagues have canceled 
their fall season for the sake of 
player safety, larger leagues have 
not followed suit. 

“This is ridiculous,” Chris said. 

“They’re not even hiding the fact 
that it’s all about revenue. It’s about 
revenue. And it’s about the money.”

With both their sons currently on 

campus for voluntary workouts, the 
Hintons fear the worst is yet to come 
if the NCAA and college programs 
themselves don’t critically review 
and alter their current approach.

“Just 
based 
on 
statistics 

somebody 
— 
somebody’s 
kid’s 

gonna die,” Chris said. “And so the 
numbers are screaming ‘pump the 
brakes.’ ”

Dy and Schulz return to golf in amateur event

Opportunities 
for 
actual 

competition are few and far 
between this summer, but golf 
remains one of the only sports 
in the country where social 
distancing 
isn’t 

a major obstacle. 
This past week, 
two 
Michigan 

women’s 
golfers 

seized 
the 

opportunity 
and 
competed 

in the Michigan 
Women’s Amateur 
Championship at 
Forest Akers Golf 
Course. 

Sophomores Anika Dy and 

Mikaela Schulz competed in 
two rounds of stroke play before 
advancing in the top 32 to match 
play, where Dy advanced to the 
quarterfinals and Schulz was 

eliminated in the first round. 

Dy rode a strong putting 

ability and overall good striking 
to match play, shooting a 71 
and 75 on the first two days. 
She was forced to change her 
approach for the match play to 
a more aggressive style, which 
carried her through the first 

two rounds. 

“I was pretty 

consistent 
through 
those 

two 
days 
(of 

stroke play),” Dy 
said. “Then match 
play hit and it’s 
like 
a 
totally 

different mindset 
and I’m definitely 
a stronger stroke 
play player. I was 

more comfortable the first two 
days, but match play was super 
fun. I’m just bummed that I 
couldn’t make it farther.”

Failing to recover from poor 

shots, coupled with shaky wedge 

and short game play, Dy lost in 
the third round of match play. 
She struggled right from the 
beginning of her final round, but 
was able to add some excitement 
going down the stretch on a run 
with some birdies. It wasn’t 
enough –– she ultimately lost the 
match with two holes to go. 

Despite being eliminated in 

the first round of match play, 
Schulz was pleased with her 
overall 
performance 
at 
the 

tournament, crediting her recent 
work on her mental game with a 
lot of her success. 

“I’m really working on just 

trusting my game and trust in 
my abilities,” Schulz said. “My 
game is more consistent than it 
has been in the past so I’m pretty 
proud of that. I think my game is 
really headed in a good direction 
right now.” 

Schulz’ mental strength was 

tested as soon as match play 
began, when she was down three 
with three holes to play. After 

not hitting a single fairway on 
the front nine, Schulz stepped 
up confidently to the tee on the 
16th hole and hit a really tight 
fairway, setting up an excellent 
approach shot to help her extend 
the match. 

With both girls competing in 

less than half the tournaments 
of a normal summer, this one 
came with added pressure, but 
both managed to treat it like any 
normal tournament. 

“It just motivates me and 

drives me to keep working and 
keep going,” Schulz said. “It’s 
really why I play the game.”
