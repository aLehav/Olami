1000 Pitches
Summit features
200 of 5,342
initial applicants
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
Investors, pay attention.,
Two hundred University stu-
dents came together Saturday
at the 1000 Pitches Summit in

Palmer Commons to push their
ideas and innovations. These
semi-finalists were selected
from a record-breaking pool
of 5,342 pitches in the startup
competition sponsored by the
student-run entrepreneurship
organization, MPowered.
Students from a variety of
disciplines submitted simple
video pitches to one of nine cat-
egories, ranging from health
to education to mobile apps. A
winner will be selected from
each of these categories, receiv-

ing $1,000 in prize money to
further their idea.
This year, the project was
expanded to Pennsylvania State
University, where the 1,000-
pitch goal was met as well. The
total of this year's campaign
reached 6,396 pitches between
the two universities.
At Saturday's summit, the
200 students with the most
impressive pitches had the
opportunity to develop their
ideas in anticipation of the
announcement of the winners

in a few weeks.
Business sophomore Zach
Wloch, a 1000 Pitches project
director, stressed the value of
the summit for the semifinal-
ists.
"We provide the basic skills
about how to take an idea to the
next level," Wloch said. "The
main goal is to promote collabo-
ration and show them that any
idea can really take off."
The summit kicked off with
advice from keynote speakers

Shared services
would centralize
275 HR and
finance staff
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
University faculty have created
a petition against the University's
proposed Shared Service Center
an open letter to University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman and Uni-
versity Provost Martha Pollack.
The consolidation of services
is a cost-saving measure that
will create a centralized loca-
tion to transfer 275 departmental
human-resource and finance from
many departments sometime

next year. Since the beginning of
November, administrators have
received a slew of letters from
University departments concern-
ing the Shared Services Center,
which is a part of the Adminis-
trative Service Transformation
project.
The Shared Services Center
is expected to save $5 million to
$6 million annually in an effort
to help reduce up to $120 million
in costs over the next five years,
according to estimates by the
University. The new center will
be located close to the Univer-
sity's Wolverine Tower building
on South State Street near Briar-
wood Mall.
The savings from the center
will be directed toward mak-
ing college more affordable for

By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
DETROIT - The University's
Detroit Center, located on the edge of
downtown, held a seminar Saturday
to educate mentors of Detroit youth
about the college admissions and
enrollment process.
The Detroit Center partnered with
the University's Center for Education-
al Outreach, Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, Office of New Student
Programs and Office of Financial Aid
to present a series of lectures aimed
at informing mentors about college
preparation, finding the right school,
procuring financial aid and adjusting
to college life. The center also reached
out to Big Brother and Big Sisters of
Metropolitan Detroit to help volun-
teers better understand how to best
serve their mentees.
Feodies Shipp III, associate direc-
tor of the Detroit Center and a former
University admissions officer, spear-
headed the educational initiative.

seventh annual
luncheon focusing
on Jewish history
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michi-
gan Hillel hosted the seventh-
annual Conference on the
Holocaust luncheon Sunday to
honor Holocaust survivors.
About 200 University stu-
dents and faculty and 50 sur-
vivors attended the luncheon,
with four to five students and
one to three survivors at each

table.As the event commenced,
students and survivors got
acquainted with intimate one-
on-one discussions over bagels
and tuna.
LSA senior Michelle Kappy
and LSA junior Alana Karbal,
co-directors of the conference,
welcomed students and sur-
vivors and encouraging them
to engage and have meaning-
ful conversation with each
other. Tilly Shames, Hillel's
executive director, spoke on
the importance of publicizing
Jewish history and survival
to the world. After, she led the
crowd in Mourner's Kaddish -
a Jewish prayer for those who
have passed.
Because Chanukah, the

Jewish festival of lights,begins
Wednesday, the event incor-
porated a holiday theme with
Chanukah cookies and spin-
ning dreidel toys on the tables.
"It is really nice to sit in a
relaxed environment with the
survivors and hear their sto-
ries," LSA sophomore Ilana
Beroff said. "It's nice to have
them sit with a small group of
students and get to know them
on a better level."

Students seek better courses in urban ed.

Forty-five years ago this
week (Nov.27,1968):
A group of students met to
discuss their discontent with
urban-education programs at
the University. These students
sought courses that would better
prepare them to teach in an urban
environment.
The students were asked to
propose a new position paper to
The Commission on Urban Edu-
cation to explain their plan of
action. Similar to the student's
goals, the commission sought to
develop an inner-city education
program and an interdisciplinary
program that offered courses in
political science, economics and
sociology.

Thirty-five years ago this cated during the tallying process,
week(Nov.29,1978): the LSA Academic Judiciary's
decision on a recount was final.

The LSA Academic Judiciary
ordered a recount of the LSA Stu-
dent Government election ballots
because of possible violations
during the tallying procedure.
Many of the LSA justices
believed that the elections direc-
tor at the time was not informed
about how the counting proce-
dure worked, which resulted in
mathematical errors. Members
of the United Students party
believed that the errors result-
ed from alcohol and marijuana
intoxication among ballot coun-
ters.

ing the vote denied being intoxi-

Twenty-five years ago this
week (Nov.28,1988):
Residents in Stockwell and the

posed that guests of residents
would have to sign in and any per-
son entering the building would
have to show identification to a
security guard.

'U' administrators'
salaries increased
by 26.9% from
2006 to 2010
By SARAH YUFA
Daily StaffReporter
Pointing to the red felt square
fastened to his shirt with a safety
pin, Engineering sophomore
Dave Wyman, a member of the
Student Union of Michigan
explained that it was an interna-
tional symbol of student solidar-
ity.
"This is how we show that we
support real democracy and real
accessibility on U of M's cam-
pus," Wyman said.
Friday, students and faculty
gathered for a Teach-In and
Strategy Session organized by
faculty, students and the Student
Union of Michigan to discuss
discontent with what they see a
perceived corporatization of the
institution.
The first hour of the teach-in
included research presentations
on the University's money flow,
endowments and the Adminis-
trative Services Transformation
project.
Rackham student Brian Whit-

ener presented his findings on
University finances and how
they affect AST. He said the Uni-
versity blames the increase in
tuition on a decline in state fund-
ing, however, financial reports
for investors present a more
complex diagram of the Univer-
sity's revenue.
Whitener described four
flows of money into the Univer-
sity that showthat the increasing
importance of student tuition is
more complicated than pictures
of declining state funding would
lead the public to believe.
Whitener said one of the
reasons tuition is rising so
aggressively is because it's the
University's only source of
revenue that comes with "no
strings attached." He argued
that tuition can go toward any-
thingthe administration desires,
including higher salaries for
themselves.
Revenue from tuition is
placed in the University's gener-
al fund, according to the Office
of the Vice President for Com-
munications. Tuition cannot be
used to support the Athletics
Department, University Hous-
ing, the University of Michigan
Health System, student publi-
cations and most construction
projects. The Michigan Daily,

like other organizations in the
Office of Student Publications,
does not accept any funding
from the University.
In describing the University's
expenditures, Whitener claimed
that funds have been going into
building construction and into
administrators' salaries, citing
that administration salaries have
risen 26.9 percent from 2006 to
2010.
He added that about a decade
ago, the University made a deci-
sion to switch to attracting out-
of-state students who pay higher
tuition and started construction
projects to do so.
Whitener said that the Univer-
sity's rising tuition and focus on
attracting out-of-state students
has transformed the composi-
tion of the student body. From
2000 to 2010 students accepted
who came from a family income
of $200,000 per year rose by 9.2
percent at the expense of stu-
dents from family incomes of
$50,000to $74,990 per yearwho
dropped in enrollment.
Additionally, he said there has
been a "dramatic whitening of
the undergraduate population
at Michigan," as the enrollment
rate for students of color has also
dropped.

Study: lack of
LGB equalityhas
detrimental effect on
public health
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
New research out of the
Schoolof Public Health breathes
urgency to the polarizing issue
of gay marriage, by highlight-
ing the depressive and psycho-
social impact of such restrictive
legislation on young gay men,
especially in regard to their
fatherhood aspirations.
While arecent Gallup pollindi-
cated that 52 percent of Ameri-
cans support the legalization of
gay marriage - up from one in
four in 1996 - same-sex marriage
remains illegal in 34states.
The study was conducted by
Assistant Public Health Prof.
Jose Bauermeister and was pub-
lished in this month's issue of
the Journal of Youth and Ado-
lescence. The report builds upon
a growing body of research on
the psychological effects of gov-
ernment policy.
Bauermeister analyzed the
survey results against state-
specific LGBTQ policies, includ-
ing bans on marriage equality,
same-sex joint parenting and
second parent adoption. He
stressed the importance of
including policies not just lim-
ited to marriage equality saying
less frequently discussed poli-
cies are also restrictive.
"You stick another layer into
it and you start seeing a lot of
parenting laws and bans in place
that prohibit either a single gay
or lesbian man or woman to
adopt or to have a child and then
have a second same-sex par-
ent added as a guardian of that
child, or to adoptcjointly," Bauer-
meister said.
The results confirmed Bau-
ermeister's hypothesis that men
who plan on raising children
had higher levels of depression
and lower levels of self-esteem
in states with LGBTQ restric-
tive policies than men with the
same aspirations in states with-
out the bans.
Furthermore, in policy-
restrictive states, the more a
participant valued his father-
hood aspirations, the more
symptoms of psychological dis-
tress he reported.
Bauermeister said the impli-
cations of such findings might
help cast light on the often-myo-
pic view in the United States in
general.
"We usually think about how
policies affect our current behav-
ior, but this is basically telling
us that policy can affect future
intention of behavior," he said.
"You don't have to be a parent
right now to start feeling the psy-
chological consequences of dis-
tress. You can actually already
start seeing some of that even if
you start thinking about having a

they realize that patients were

Riddell explained that while
the virus is often successfully
suppressed nowadays, the dif-
ficulty with curing HIV is
that it's not only stored in the
immune system, but also has
reservoirs in other parts of the
body. Thus patients who have
been relieved of HIV from their
immune system run the risk of
the virus being released from
the reservoirs.

kid 20 years down the line."
Public Health Prof. Gary
Harper said politicians that pro-
pose such restrictive policies are
often more concerned with get-
ting reelected than with the con-
sequences the policies produce.
"(Politicians) need to real-
ize that those restrictions do
have real-world influences on
individuals, especially adoles-
cents who are developing their
sense of self and sense of who
they are," Harper said. "That's
a really critical time and these
restrictive and oppressive laws
can have an extremely damag-
ing impact on the adolescent."
Harper's emphasis on ado-
lescents comes from 20 years
of experience as a clinical child
psychologist with a focus on
young gay men. He said Bauer-
meister's research underscores
worrisome implications for the
younger demographic.
"If from very early on you
were told that you are not as
good as everybody else, then you
are notgoingto develop ahealthy
sense of self-esteem because at
every turn you are told you're not
as good as other people," Harper
said. "When we have marriage
restriction laws, we are basically
saying to a young gay person,
'Your love for another person is
not recognized by the state, so
that means it's not as good as het-
erosexual love."'
For the study, male par-
ticipants completed a 30- to
45-minute online questionnaire
that focused on relationship and
partner characteristics, sexual
behaviors, psychological well-
being, and sexing behaviors.
The 1,683 eligible 18- to
24-year olds were predomi-
nantly recruited through
Facebook and peer referral.
Targeted advertising and mon-
etary incentives were used to
produce the large sample size,
of which 65 percent was White
Caucasian - considered racial-
ly and ethnically diverse for
research standards.
Harper is one of 25 research-
ers in the Center for Sexuality
& Health Disparities, referred
to as the SexLab, which Bau-
ermeister founded in 2009 and
currently directs.
Bauermeister said he hopes
to build upon his research by
exploring motherhood aspira-
tions of lesbians and bisexual
women and by lengthening the
study timeframe to examine
longstanding effects of indi-
vidual policy on psychological
wellbeing.
Hawaii and Illinois recently
became the most recent states
to pass legislation legalizing
gay marriage. Harper is happy
with the progress, but said
there is a fundamental problem.
"If we live ina countrywhere
we say that all people are creat-
ed equal and we have protection
on almost every other identity
characteristic under the sun,"
Harper said. "Why is it this one
factor is the only factor that we
federally, legally discriminate?"

that would benefit the Ann Arbor

Morrison said she hopes to

won $900 at the first event last
spring, then named UM SOUP.
Since then, it has launched a
pilot program, and has been
working with clients on bud-

credit building.
Morrison said she changed
the name from UM SOUP to Ann
Arbor SOUP because she wanted
to include the whole Ann Arbor
community and bridge the divide
between students and other com-
munity members.

Statewide student safety
School evacuation plans should be comprehensive and accessible
In the past few years, there have been high-profile and deadly school
shootings that often cause Americans to question laws surrounding
emergency evacuations in schools. While there is usually a discussion
on school safety immediately surrounding a tragic shooting, there never
seems to be much preventative action taken at the state level. A recent
report released by Save the Children, a non-governmental disaster relief
organization, found that Michigan is one of four states that fails to meet all
the evacuation and relocation criteria set by the National Commission on
Children and Disasters. Michigan can't wait for a disaster to strike to for-
mulate plans to keep students, teachers and staff safe. Multifaceted school
evacuation plans, which include plans for evacuation/relocation, family-
child reunification, children with special needs and multiple-disaster
scenarios, must become a statewide policy, and legislators need to ensure
lower-income schools can implement these safety measures.

Though Michigan doesn't meet the stan-
dards created by the National Commission on
Children and Disasters, the state does require
schools to practice six fire drills, two tornado
drills, and two other safety drills -- one of
which must be a lockdown drill. Some school
districts have gone even further, creating
their own emergency evacuation plans.
The lack of the policy's uniformity across
Michigan's school districts, however, is cause
for concern. By leaving these plans up to the
discretion of local districts, affluent com-
munities have access to better precautionary
plans. Schools that don't have the resources
to fully consider and implement plans are

putting students at greater risk than their
peers in wealthier districts. Legislators must
take into consideration economic solutions
for districts who are unable to afford proper
emergency evacuations plans.
In the meantime, school districts should
look for gaps in their current emergency haz-
ard plans that are easy and affordable to rem-
edy. Having one entry point into the building
and putting locks on the inside of classrooms
are simple solutions educators could imple-
ment immediately. Parents must understand
and explain to their children their school's
emergency hazard plan to help create a more
prepared environment if disaster does occur.

We can't give up on the ACA

Have you ever had the perfect chocolate
chip cookie? One that's just soft enough, has
the perfect amount of chocolate chips and
sugar, and is flawlessly
complimented by a glass
of milk? Growing up, I
was lucky to experience *
the sensation of eating just
this type of cookie many
times.
The Jones' house was \
always my favorite to go to
when I was younger. Cole PATRICK
Jones, one of my child- MAILLET
hood best friends, was one - ---n s
of seven children raised by
Sam and Patty Jones. Although the kids each
added a particular element to the house, Sam
and Patty were really the two that gave the
house the character that I loved. Above all
else, Patty added the single most important
characteristic of all: her famed recipe for
chocolate chip cookies.
No matter what was going on, I knew that
I could always go to the Jones' house and
receive a great meal, usually a cookie, and a
warm welcome. It was my home away from
home.
Last month I received a phone call from
my mom. Her voice cracked as it always does
right before she delivers bad news. Patty
Jones had had a seizure the night before and
was taken to the hospital where they found
a sizable tumor in her brain. Patty was diag-
nosed with advanced-stage brain cancer.
My heart dropped when I heard the news.
Patty was the epitome of a healthy and active
woman. Famous for riding her bike dozens
of miles a day, Patty was in great shape and
seemed like the last person who could get
sick. But as it always does, cancer showed me
once again that its victims were those who
you would least expect.
While dealing with the initial shock of
hearing that a mother figure from my child-
hood was facing a fatal diagnosis, my mom
gave me possibly worse news: Patty doesn't
have health insurance. Suddenly my emo-
tions were overcome with the practical asser-
tions that come with that statement. I knew
that medical bills are the number one cause
for bankruptcy in the United States. Worst of
all, I knew that instead of focusing on beat-
ing cancer like she should, Patty was going to
have to figure out how to pay for her skyrock-
eting health costs.
Last week I talked to Patty's oldest daugh-
ter, Gina, who has taken the lead in caring for
her mother. Although Gina sounded strong
and confident in her mother's ability to beat
cancer, I could tell that she was frustrated
with the endless loops that she had gone
through in the past couple weeks. Like mil-
lions of Americans, Gina and her mom have

repeatedly gone onto healthcare.gov only to
be led to a dead end.
They've tried callingthe help line and they
were told that there is a plan that Patty quali-
fies for, but that it wouldn't go into effect until
January 1. When Gina tried looking into pri-
vate insurers, all of them were uninterested
in Patty's preexisting condition and resound-
ingly rejected her plan. Until January 1, Patty
will have to pay for everything out of pocket.
So far, Patty has received a brainbiopsy and
a craniotomy to reduce the size of the tumor.
These procedures cost $51,000 and $49,000
respectively. In four weeks, Patty will begin
a radiation and chemotherapy treatment plan
in which each round of treatment will cost
anywhere between $20,000 and $65,000.
These numbers are staggering, but luckily
Patty has the love and support of her fam-
ily and friends. In fact, Gina and her siblings
have started an account on giveforward.com
for their mother and have raised $53,000 and
counting.
What about those who aren't fortunate
enough to have a team behind them for their
battle against cancer? Who makes the phone
calls to every neurosurgeon on the East Coast
for these people? Who has their back?
The Affordable Care Act was a giant step in
trying to help millions of uninsured Ameri-
cans while also lowering costs for those
already insured. Unfortunately, the rollout
for the ACA has been an absolute nightmare.
Healthcare.gov has countless bugs that are
leaving millions of people without answers as
to how they are supposed to meet the March
31, 2014 deadline of signing up for health
insurance.
The ACA undeniably has its flaws, but the
need for reform is still very much alive. There
are approximately 48-million uninsured
Americans. These people aren't bottom-
feeders or slackers -- they're our family mem-
bers, our neighbors and, in some cases, our
favorite cookie bakers. To simply forget these
people amongst all of the political banter that
has, and will, continue to be thrown around
would be a travesty.
Health care is a right, not a privilege. The
ACA needs some serious work, but giving up
on healthcare reform now would be a massive
step backward in fixing our broken system.
The political back-and-forth surrounding the
healthcare bill overlooks people like Patty
Jones - people who can't wait for the Repub-
lican answer to what they call an "insidious"
law. They need coverage, coverage that's not
hinging on legislative plays.
If anyone is going to beat cancer, it's Patty.
But we need to make sure asa country that we
have Patty's back.

SAMIA AYYASH 
'Why do you care ? You're not even Black!'

The title of this article echoes the
exact words that were yelled at me
in my Arabic class just this week by
a fellow Arab-American student.
Prior to presenting on Jamal 'Abd
al-Nasser, my colleague opened his
University e-mail in front of the class
to access his project. The title of the
email he sent to himself was "My
N****' Nasser." While I didn't initial-
ly notice or say anything, I was sworn
to secrecy by a friend in the class not
to say anything after I was informed.
I complied until I was eventually
forced to choose between complicity
and moral obligation.
In between snickers and giggles
- as if this was a light-hearted mat-
ter - that same friend who swore
me to secrecy commented on her
disbelief to the presenter that he
would have written and, at the
very least, displayed such words
in front of the class. Perhaps over-
come by guilt, shame or challenge,
my colleague waved his arms in
the air and assured loudly that no
one in the class cared, and it was
fine. While entitled to his freedom
of expression, he's not entitled to
make assumptions about mine. I
cared. I interjected simply to tell
him so, and that's all it took for him
to condemn me with: "Why do you
care? You're not even Black!" This
was then followed by "So what if
I'm racist? I'm a racist, so what?"
In the midst of campus climate
and the ongoing Theta Xi disgrace,
there are so many things I could
have, and should have, said. But
what seemed more personal was
that my colleague was not only a
fellow classmate, but also a fellow
Arab American. The explicit racism
in his use of the "N" word and his
misunderstanding of its history are
appalling and wrong. But he, and
seemingly the other silent students
in my class, didn't find fault enough
to speak up about this, nor about his
implication that I surely should not
care about race, as I'm not Black.
I cannot speak on behalf of other
cultures, races and ethnicities,
but I can speak on my own expe-
riences - my experiences as an
Arab American whose culture has

been informed by anti-Black ideals.
Our culture is beautiful and proud,
but the ugly truth behind my col-
league's comments and e-mail sub-
ject line isn't a reflection of what we
as Arab Americans and peripheral
communities want to stand for, and
it is certainly not a reflection of my
own beliefs. Of course, I cared. And
I didn't have to be Black to do so - I
only had to be human.
Again, I can only comment on my
own experiences, and those experi-
ences included multiple occasions
of my aforementioned classmate
using the "N" word to casually refer
to friends. Others and I corrected
him, but he missed the point. To
clarify to him and other bigoted
individuals, there is no "cool" way
to use this word as you suggest.
You sound ignorant, elitist, rac-
ist and foolish when you use it to
refer to your friends or classmates,
and neither you nor the person you
are addressing is Black or African
American.
The "N word" has an incredible
history of injustice and oppression
that cannot be ignored, and that's
perpetuated every time you appro-
priate it. Again, while it's not mine
to claim, what I have observed
and learned is that the Black com-
munities who were originally held
in contempt by the "N" word have
redefined it to empower them-
selves and define their history of
struggle. You have no right to it,
and neither do I. As the use of the
"N" word spreads and becomes
more common, you infringe on yet
another right of Black and African
Americans - as if the institutional-
ized racism in this country has not
been thorough enough. And now,
because you use the "N" word and
carry the same brand that I have
been labeled with in America, oth-
ers assume that I stand for this, too.
Please stop.
As a community that has over-
all been quite successful in Amer-
ica socioeconomically, we as Arab
Americans have empowered our-
selves materially and forgotten the
richness of our past. When we appro-
priate words that we have no right to,

we become the colonizers, the impe-
rialists and the neoliberals who tore
apart our countries because we were
not 'fit' or 'civil' enough for self-rule
and self-determination. When we
are passive about these daily occur-
rences, we play into the power struc-
ture in America that is systematically
influenced by its racist past - and
present.
We have simultaneously helped
create and played into a hierar-
chy of races, the highest of which
is the white male that we strive
to become. We distance ourselves
from blackness with lighthearted
comments affirming our neither
white nor Black status - "Oh, I'm
sun-kissed" or "I'm olive-skinned"
are among my favorites. Why do we
do this? Why do we strive tobecome
what we should rightfully despise?
Why is it acceptable that the root of
empowerment in America for Arab-
Americans and other marginalized
groups is anti-blackness?
I can't even deny this reality
in my own life. Growing up, I was
told not to stay outside for too long.
What would the neighbors or our
relatives say if I was too dark? And
not to mention the way that Arab
American communities refer to
Black and African Americans as
'abd or 'abeed, meaning slave. Have
we forgotten the Arab slave trade
and the systematic discrimination
likened to apartheid that exists in
our beloved Palestine?
It's logical and right that we are
therefore the natural allies in this
intra-campus struggle that has
thankfully found its way into the
national spotlight. The race and
diversity issues that we face at the
University of Michigan are merely
a microcosm of greater issues in
America and elsewhere. From an
Arab American's view, our cultural
ideals are in need of re-evaluation.
We are not alone in needing to reex-
amine and amend our thinking,
traditions and statements when it
comes to allying with the Black
struggle. These events are our call
for mutual solidarity.

istrative costs without consider-
ing the toll it will have on staff
productivity. Notable signatories
include former University Presi-
dent James Duderstadt, several
former deans and several former
department chairs, among others.
Ulaby said the AST model is
"one model fits all," and the goals
and functions of each department
differ too much to work efficient-
ly in a centralized location.
The petition reiterates con-
cerns expressed by University
departments in multiple letters
sent earlier this month to admin-
istrators, which include concerns
about the lack of consultation
while developing the process and
the program's overarching effect
on low- to lower-middle-income
women.
Thepetitionlays outthe down-
falls of the AST model, which
include six key consequences of
the center.
The petition argues that facul-
ty productivity would be reduced
 by 10 to 20 percent, because the
model would make faculty per-
form clerical tasks usually per-
formed by support staff, such
as making copies for class and
arranging meetings. Addition-
ally, the interface would be
 replaced by e-mail and web com-
munication.

high-school students because the
mentors already have a close rela-
tionship with mentees who they
can prepare for college.
"This is aimed at people who
care about young people and
want to be able to see themselves
as a resource to help young peo-
ple be successful later in life,"
 Shipp said.
The college-bound audience
ranged from elementary- and
high-school teachers to parents
of young people, as well as stu-
dents considering applying to
college.
The event started with two
presentations by the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions on
finding a the right college for a
student's needs, how students
can prepare for college during
high school and what the applica-
tion process entails.
The presentations encouraged
students to start thinking about
college early and to find the right
college for them - as opposed

doesn't work, and we need to
achieve the same cost-saving role
we support but by having every
unit develop its'own strategy it
fits the character, style and every
way they do business," Ulaby said.
Additionally, the petition
claims a 10-percent reduction
in faculty productivity would
result in a decrease of research
funding. It proposes an alterna-
tive model called Unit-Centric
Services, which involves a more
decentralized structure with spe-
cific departmental committees to
develop higher productivity, and
thus higher revenues, although
other universities have adapted to
the centralized model proposed
by University administrators.
If implemented, UCS proposes
that the dean of each school or col-
lege create a 10-person committee
of faculty, staff and administrators
to put in motion a strategic plan
for the general fund budget estab-
lished by the central administra-
tion. Similar to how the Medical
School develops its own financial
savings model, this alternative
places more trust in the individual
school departments.
The petition also alleges that
the use of the consulting firm
Accenture is in opposition to the
University's values and goals.
"The University is not a cor-
poration; it's an academic insti-
tution," Ulaby said. "Trying to
convert it to a corporation is det-
rimental to its mission."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily on Friday, Pro-
vost Pollack said the University
used Accenture to help aid the
decision-making process and cre-
ate the organizational structure
of the Shared Services Center.
Although the petition criticizes
the University for using an out-
side contractor, Pollack said the
University only hires an external
consulting firm when necessary.
to only thinking about popular
schools.
"You want to be able to put
yourself in the best situation to
advance yourself as far as pos-
sible," Shipp said.
Ann Hower, director of the
Office of New Student Programs,
discussed how to best prepare stu-
dents to transition into a college
lifestyle. She said it's important
mentors ease students' concerns
about adjusting to college life.
Deric Williams, assistant
director of outreach at the Office
of Financial Aid, concluded the
event with a presentation on how
to pay for college. He explained
the variety of options available to
students, includingstudent loans,
scholarship opportunities and
financial aid.
Detroit resident Alecia Cart-
er, whose son is in 11th grade,
thought the event was very help-
ful in educating her about the col-
lege admission process.
"I feel more informed than
I did before I got here," Carter
said. "I'm ready to make some
decisions, and I know which way
I'm headed."

Historically, Ulaby said the
administration has communi-
cated with the faculty well when
implementing new policies or
procedures. Though the admin-
istration sent concerned faculty
an e-mail apologizing for the
flawed decision-making process
on Thursday, Ulaby said the state-
ment was not enough to solve the
issue at hand.
"It's not just the process that's
flawed; it is the essence of AST
that is flawed," Ulaby said.
Pollack said the e-mail apolo-
gized for inaccuracies in the deci-
sion-making process and facts
presented to the faculty.
"We recognize the concerns
when there's a lot of inaccuracies
and we want to make sure they
understand the points and we
aren't making the decisionsbased
on inaccuracies," Pollack said.
The signatories wrote that the
administration has two options:
to implement AST against their
will, or to create an approach
similar to UCS.
"We implore that you follow
the judicious path," the letter
stated. "Restore sanity to the Uni-
versity of Michigan, which we all
love and feel proud to be a part of,
and allow us all to work together
to make our great university even
greater and more productive."
At the end of the petition, sev-
eral faculty members gave testi-
monials supporting the letter's
contents.
"As it is, I average 70 hours
a week, and I can't take on the
additional five hours imposed by
AST," onetestimonial said. "More
than likely, in future semesters, I
will stop making myself avail-
able to students on a daily basis,
and will limit myself to the three
hours designated as official office
hours for the course. The obvious
consequence for students is long
lines and long waits."
In its role in promoting diver-
sity on campus, Shipp said he
believes the University does a
good job of informing students
from Detroit about the college
admissions process and prepara-
tion. However, he said it does not
have the "flexibility" to admit
students in the manner it would
like to.
After a constitutional ban on
considering race and gender in
college admissions that passed
in 2006, the University has been
barred from considering race as
a factor in the admissions pro-
cess. In order to counteract the
subsequent decline in enrollment
of underrepresented minorities,
the University has worked on
alternative outreach programs
to encourage students from these
groups to apply.
"I think the Detroit Center's
goal is to continue to provide
exposure to University life to
the residents of the city Detroit,
and I think that continuing to
have exposure to aspects of the
University of life, you will entice
individuals to try and take part in
it," Shipp said.

properly.
With those inspiring words
in mind, the students split into
smaller workshops to take a
closer look at their pitches and
figure out how to improve them.
Participants were able to discuss
their ideas together and get feed-
back from both mentors and their
peers.
Engineering freshman Teri
LaForest was one of the 200
semi-finalists. Her pitch included
a new type of contact lens that
has the ability to take a picture,
providing the user with a more
precise image.
She said pitching her idea got
her out of her comfort zone.
LaForest entered the compe-
tition as an assignment for her
gulag, Miller and her parents
were transported to Uzbekistan
where she and her sister were put
in a Jewish orphanage.
When the war ended, Miller
returned to Poland and was
placed in an orphanage in Kra-
kow. When she was 17, she moved
to Israel where she married and
later moved to the United States.
"I was very glad to have an
opportunity to share my story
with the younger people," Miller
said.
Stefa Kupfer, another survi-
vor, also shared her story of going
into hiding with her mother and
sister. During the war, Kupfer
obtained papers that said she was
an Aryan and was concealed and
cared for by a Christian woman
in Poland.
"She didn't do it for money and
she didn't do it for fame; she was
just a good person," Kupfer said.
"Basically, she saved my life."
Kupfer was forced to lose con-
tact with the woman who hid her
to ensure the woman wouldn't
be harassed by her anti-Semitic
claimed Munger had the idea
of building graduate dorms to
increase productivity by group-
ing together students from dif-
ferent disciplines.
"Anyone who knows anything
about grad students knows they
don't typically choose to live in
seven-bedroom dorms with peo-
ple they don't know," Andersson
said, adding that facilities such as
the dorm and the proposed athlet-
ic facilities are unwanted by most
of the graduate student body.
Afterward, the teach-in tran-
sitioned into a strategy session
in which participants broke
into groups to discuss ways to
act against what they called the
increasing "financialization" of
the University.
Possible ideas included col-
laborating with other student

she enjoyed the satisfaction of
developing it further in the sum-
mit workshops.
The pitches came from a
diverse collection of students.
Most pitches this year came from
LSA students, and there was also
a strongshowing of Business stu-
dents.
Business sophomore Emily
Goodman developed a pitch
about fundraising methods for
various environmental efforts
as part of her involvement in the
Tamid Israel Investment Group,
a business club. While she is still
unsure about pursuing her pitch,
she found both the summit and
the competition as a whole to be
a great learning experience mov-
ing forward with future ideas.

"This is a big pain in my heart
that we never had a chance to say
thank you," Kupfer said. "I am
sure that if there is such a thing,

After the war, Kupfer lived
in a displacement camp in Aus-
tria before moving to the United
States in 1952.
Following the event, stu-
dents and survivors previewed
an art exhibit organized by Art

Meningitis victims hope for
Mass. criminal charges

BOSTON (AP) - Dirk Thomp-
son III doesn't hold out much hope
that he and the 750other victims in
a nationwide meningitis outbreak
will ever see much, if any, compen-
sation for the deaths and illnesses
causedby tainted steroids.
He hopes to find justice anoth-
er way if criminal charges are
brought against the principals of
a Massachusetts compounding
pharmacy that made the steroid
injections blamed for the fungal
meningitis outbreak.
A federal grand jury in Boston
has been investigating the New
England Compounding Center
for more than a year. A separate
grand jury in Minnesota also has
been conducting an investigation.
"They have to be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law," said
Thompson, 58, of Howell, Mich.,

who was hospitalized for 38 days
with meningitis after receiving
a steroid injection for back pain.
"They were totally irresponsible."
Since the contaminated ste-
roids were first discovered, 751
people in 20 states have devel-
oped fungal meningitis or other
infections, includingf64 who died.
Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana
were the hardest-hit states.
Federal prosecutors have
declined to comment on the
investigation, but the FBI recently
asked anyone who received one of
the tainted injections to fill out a
questionnaire detailing their ill-
nesses and saying whether they
believe another medication dis-
tributed by NECC caused harm to
them or their family.
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette said in a statement

on Sunday that he and Boston
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz will
hold a news conference Monday
to discuss a development in the
independent state and federal
.investigations into NECC.
The FBI, which has also sent
agents to visit victims, set a Nov.30
deadline for victims to submit the

Itisunclearwhetherthecompany
or its executives will face criminal
charges. Several lawyers who rep-
resent victims in lawsuits say health
care companies charged with sell-
ing contaminated drugs often reach
settlements with the federal govern-
ment and agree to paylarge fines.But
the NewEngland Compoundingcase
is different because ofthe large num-
ber of deaths and serious illnesses
caused by the tainted steroids.

The Wilson family was provid-

basic necessities during their

more than 11-month stay at Mott

Payne talks origins
of 'Nebraska'

Acclaimed director
discusses casting
for latest project
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Arts Writer
In a conference call with
The Michigan Daily, acclaimed
director Alexander Payne ("The
Descendants") was asked if he
had any pre-directing rituals.
Citing his Greek heritage, he
said, "I anoint my entire body
with olive oil. It also keeps me
warm."
But once you get beyond the
sarcasm, you find in Payne an
artist grounded in reality who
wants nothing more than to
make his characters as reflec-
tive of real life as possible. It's
why so many ofhis films revolve
around similar themes, such as
the impact of adultery on famil-
ial relationships. It's also why
he chooses to cast non-actors in
supporting roles.
"My movies combine, typi-
cally, three groups of actors,"
he said. "One group is the
highly seasoned professionals.
The other is non-profession-
al actors, maybe people from
community theater and com-
mercials. And then another,
the third group, is non-actors.
That is to say, people who have
never acted in their lives before,
but who bring a certain level of
reality to a movie."
The casting process is a care-

ful one, even for big name actors.
For Payne, who is responsible
for launching the careers of the
likes of Shailene Woodley ("The
Descendants"), it all comes down
to an audition. All of the actors
must blend in such a way as to
ground the movie: "They're all
part of the same tapestry."
Payne's latest work is "Nebras-
ka," an examination of the gen-
eration raised on the American
dream and the dissatisfaction
that follows a lifetime of those
aspirations beingunfulfilled. The
film is shot entirely in black and
white, contrasting every hori-
zon with every crack in the black
road of this American pastoral.
"When I first read the script
nine years ago, I imagined it only
in black and white," Payne said.
"The very austere nature of the
screenplay to me suggested a
visual style in black and white."
In other words, monochrome is
simple: It's real.
"Nebraska" is one of a handful
of recent films from bigger-name
directors to use this style, includ-
ing the Oscar-winning silent film
"The Artist" in 2012. To him,
monochrome is a lost art that's
being picked up by independent
filmmakers.
"(The style) might be a format
which is so old that it's actually
new again and kind of exciting."
But he hopes this lost aesthetic
will become more than a trend.
"It's a beautiful form and
I don't think you're seeing -
younger people who have only
seen color TVs haven't seen

black-and-white movies and
don't know that our great film
heritage is largely in black and
white."
In explaining why he has shot
three of his four feature films in
Nebraska, he states that he feels
comfortable in his home state.
"Well, you never ask Woody
Allen why he likes to shoot
in New York or Paul Thomas
Anderson why he wants to shoot
in L.A.," he said. "You just accept
that. Why do you have to pester
me about why I like to shoot in
Nebraska?"
There's a certain comfort to
working with familiarity, but it
also allows for a deeper exami-
nation of one's roots; even as an
Omaha, Neb. native, Payne was
still unfamiliar with much of the
state.
"A lot of Omahans don't really
know the rural rest of the state.
So it was a nice excuse for me to
get to know the rest of my state."
Payne was so committed to
finding the perfect town for
"Nebraska" that he spent over
a year scouting and put 20,000
miles on his car in the process.
All in all, Payne always has a
reason to keep going back to
Nebraska.
"I'm from there. You wouldn't
ask William Faulkner why do
you continue to write in Oxford,
Mississippi? It's just where
people are from. And somehow
where you're from has an amaz-
ing gravitational pull over your
life. Not for everyone, but for
many people."

The most unfulfilled charac-
ter of "Dallas Buyers Club" is Eve
Saks (Jennifer Garner, "Juno"),
a physician torn between legal
medical protocol and what she
knows to be best for her patients.
You sympathize with her situa-
tion, but her character receives
sporadic screen time, causing her
emotional keynotes to appear flat
and underdeveloped.
The film contains several
problems of oversight in the plot.
Woodroof inexplicably smuggles
years-worth of unapproved drugs
across the Mexico border, and I
keeps his "buyers club" operat-
ing based on loopholes and tech-
nicalities with American drug
laws. How such subversionoccurs
remains murky throughout.
The screenplay, written by
first-timers Craig Borten and I
Melisa Wallack, spreads itself
slightly too thin, and gives us
too much what, not enough why
or how. Because the premise
creates skyscraping emotional
stakes, the film can afford to
scratch only the surface of its
important themes.
Director Jean-Marc Vallde
("Cafe de Flore") inserts some
beautiful shots, opening and
closing the film with artistic
sequences that, together, effec-
tively encapsulate the trans-
formation of Woodroof from a
homophobic, ignorant, under-
achieving cowboy into an activ-
ist with a fresh take on the value
of his life. His use of sound and
silence takes viewers into Wood-
roof's mind, forcing us to experi-
ence his disorientation.
Coupled with the superb
lead acting, the film draws its
power from the intense personal
struggles of its characters. Both
Woodroof and Rayon face their
mortality as young men, and we
feel their raw pain throughout
the ordeal.
A story that deals with an
array of human problems, "Dal-
las Buyers Club" will toy with
your emotions - provoking
anger, sadness and pity.

'Makawalu' to
bring Hawaii to A2

Let's talk about sex

Internationally
renowned artists to
perform
By KATHLEEN DAVIS
Daily Arts Writer
In a practice that seamlessly
intertwines the spiritual, eco-
logical and visually stunning,
not many cre-
ative outlets Makawalu:
are as complex The Concert
or beautiful as
native Hawai- Monday at
ian music and 7 p.M.
dance. After
an elongat- Mendelssohn
ed planning
process, the Free
University is
hosting a two-day event to bring
indigenous Hawaiian culture to
Ann Arbor free to the public.
Monday, the Lydia Men-
delssohn Theatre will host
"Makawalu: The Concert,"
featuring internationally
renowned native Hawaiian
artists Kekuhi Kealiikanaka-
oleohaililani and Kaumakaiwa
Kanaka'ole. The mother-child
duo will be making their Ann
Arbor debut after several shows

on the east coast.
The event is spearheaded by
Amy Stillman and Susan Naji-
ta, who are both Asian/Pacific
Islander Studies Program pro-
fessors at the University.
"There is, to this day, a core
of native Hawaiian knowledge
and cultural practices and ways
of being that have persisted,"
Stillman said. "These two art-
ists are two of the most con-
summate exemplars of a truly
indigenous way of being in the
21st century."
Kekuhi and Kaumakaiwa's
music style is a showcase of
what native Hawaiian artists
are about. Featuring dramatic
melodies, passionate lyrics and
ancient 'oli chants, Stillman
and Najita are confident that
the concert will be worth see-
ing, even for those with little
knowledge of Hawaiian culture.
"You are transported into a
different reality (during their
concerts)," Najita said. "People
go to the movies for that."
Directly translated,
"makawalu" means "eight eyes"
and encourages people to devel-
op multiple perspectives.
The concert will be followed
by a lecture the next morning
at 10 in 3512 Haven Hall. The

lecture will focus on hula as
a global phenomenon and the
concurrent spiritual, social,
psychological and ecological
impacts.
"In this part of the country,
there's still a lot of stereotypes
and misperceptions about who
native Hawaiians are as peo-
ple," Stillman said. "For us to
bring to campus two artists that
are renowned internationally as
21st century native Hawaiians
is extraordinary."
The events are sponsored by a
wide array of programs and indi-
viduals within the University.
"(Native Hawaiian culture)
speaks to many different potential
interlockers," Najita said. "There's
a literature side of things, an
American culture side of things,
there's performance and a gender
studies side of things."
Both Stillman and Najita hope
the events educate individuals
who may not have much knowl-
edge about Hawaiian culture.
"I'd like to think that there will
be a greater awareness and appre-
ciation for indigenous people and
indigenous heritages in the United
States and locally," Stillman said.
"And more attentiontothe value of
indigenous knowledge to 21st cen-
tury living."

"Umm ... it's really geomet-
ric."
That's the first response
featured in a Posture article

acclaimed
yet con-
troversial
new French
drama, "Blue
Is the Warm-

bit of analy-
sis comes


from an equally unsure inter-
viewee, who pauses, looks
at her cat, before hesitantly
admitting, "I thought it was
hot at the beginning, and then
it got kind of ridiculous when
they started switching sex
positions every five seconds. It
made it look like an infomercial
for a kitchen product where
they're trying to showcase all
the things it can do."
It's an interesting analogy
that, in more direct terms,
harkens back to a classic cri-
tique of most sloppily executed
love-making scenes: They're a
cursory way of fast-forwarding
through intimacy. By mash-
ing together a weird potpourri
of shots, usually lacking any
guiding context, the scenes
become oddly detached from
the subject matter they look to
examine.
And there's the catch -
something as intensely inti-
mate as porking on the kitchen
counter shouldn't stick out
like gym-short boners in films
generally defined by their
strict adherence to structure.
Don't blow a gasket, love-story
aficionados. Every movie is
still a beautiful and unique
snowflake, and though I'm not
saying cinema designed to tug
at the heartstrings is all the
same, it's hard to deny the fact
that most real-world depiction
of doe-eyed love waltzes to a
similar tune: initial sparks ser-
enaded by lustful discussions
of the future, ultimately cul-
minating in reconsiderations
stemming from far-fetched
prospects of commitment.
Given "Blue" 's three-hour
runtime, it's an interesting
choice by director Abdellatif
Kechiche - who invests 10
minutes in his longest uninter-
rupted sex scene - to shoot his
schtiiping leading ladies in a
format completely at odds with
the rest of the movie. This
film, unlike so many recent
love stories, is about inter-
mittence. The boring, forced
moments in which Keniche
makes us stare into Adele's
expressionless face as it sucks
on spaghetti are meant to be
lead-ins - lead-ins toward raw
emotion that never seems to
surface in the film's sweaty
displays of bodies smacking
against each other.
Keniche builds close to
an hour of tedium around
his protagonist's first sexual
encounter with a woman.
Intermittently, he sprinkles
more time between each
following encounter. Inter-
mittently, he decreases the
length of those encounters.
And intermittently, he dilutes
the emotional weight of what
those encounters signify,
until finally, they're blan-
keted by irrelevance. There's
never any meaningful fore-
play, just uncomfortable talks
about the future and vague
attempts to hide the relation-
ship. Doing this throws the
relationship, in the eyes of the
audience, into limbo - the
protagonists are just holding
onto each other for the sake
of sex.
It's a simple yet effective

way to look at the decom-
position of love, and indeed,
Keniche succeeds in convinc-
ingly picking apart the implied
interdependence of his two
protagonists by the time the
credits roll. Still, it's the sex
scenes that stick with you
when you walk out the door.
And they stick with you for
the wrong reasons.
In every illustration of inti-
macy, Keniche pulls us back
from the frame and presents
his subjects with a noticeable
objectivity reeking of a lack
of understanding. He follows

hopes to continue FOX's good
fortune on the night and become
a much-needed hit for the
network. From J.J. Abrams's
appropriately titled Bad Robot
Productions, the series is a
futuristic procedural, pairing
human cops with robot part-

In the year 2048, when the

Gone is
the shaky camera from the first
movie. Instead, director Francis
Lawrence ("I Am Legend") com-
mands the audience to focus on
steady close-ups and long, cen-
tered frames. A character dies
withvicious immediacy early on in
the film and Lawrence draws out
every vivid moment of the scene.
"CatchingFire" embraces the hor-
rors ofthe Hunger Games over and
over again in this way, resulting
in 147 minutes of white-knuckling
the edge ofyour seat.
Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer
Lawrence, "Silver Linings Play-
book") is thrown into spotlight
after winning the 74th Hun-
ger Games with. fellow tribute

"Epic"). The oppressed nation of

which President Snow (Donald

Sutherland, "Jappeloup") tolerates
the way an exterminator toler-
ates cockroaches. Katniss and the
rebellion must be quashed - and
with this, he throws her and Peeta
into the next televised Hunger
Games by requiring past victors to
be tributes.
For fans of the books, it's a real
treat to see the other victors come
to life. Fans can let out the breaths
they've been holding because
the characters are perfectly cast.
Sam Claflin ("Snow White and
the Huntsman") plays dreamboat
Finnick Odaire with a crooked
smile that will likely be soon
plastered all over Tumblr in .gif
form. Jena Malone ("The Wait")
drops in (and drops her clothes)
as Johanna Mason, who gives
Katniss a run for the Strongest
'n' Sassiest Female spot. Malone
deftly adds sympathetic layers
to her character that aren't even
present in the books.
Malone's creative interpreta-
tion of Johanna is an exception
because "Catching Fire" attempts
to be as true as possible to the
book from which it's adapted.
These attempts cause a few hic-
cups. The book's cliffhanger end-
ing becomes jarring and awkward
on screen. Gale Hawthorne (Liam
Hemsworth, "Paranoia"), Kat-
niss's love interest who lives back
home, also disappears from the
pages after she leaves her district.
This makes sense in the book
because of how tightly the nar-
rative follows her point of view.
She's in the Games; Gale isn't.
But a good adaptation isn't nec-
essarily an exact adaptation. The
movie allows for a much grander
scale because of its medium: For
example, the camera can swoop
over arena treetops and travel
through row after row of drum-

mers at a Capitol parade. It could
have therefore inserted just a
single extra moment of Gale
watching the Games' broadcast
or simply looking depressed.
Instead, "Catching Fire" whisks
Gale away just as the book does,
the abrupt cut creating a total
lack of chemistry between Hem-
sworth and Lawrence. Their
characters' relationship is uncon-
vincing because of how little
screen time Hemsworth receives.
However, the rest of the cast
is electric. Stanley Tucci ("The
Fifth Estate") steals every scene
he's in as Caesar Flickerman, a
talk-show host reminiscent of an
overly caffeinated Ryan Seacrest
whose family seems to be held
hostage by a malicious govern-
ment. His buoyancy reeks of
desperation and artificiality in
a world where image is every-
thing. Elizabeth Banks ("Man
on a Ledge"), too, is oddly mov-
ing as Effie Trinket, Katniss's
gaudy one-woman PR team. And
Philip Seymour Hoffman ("The
Master") graces the screen as
new Head Gamemaker Plutarch
Heavensbee, oozing slickness
and secrets.
Heavensbee's Games takes
no prisoners. The film reflects
this with a much more raw and
darker tone than its predeces-
sor. The glimpses of rebellion, in
fact, seem like an eerie alternate
universe of our present world.
One scene of a rebel holding up
a sign amid flames exactly paral-
lels a famous photo from the 2012
Egyptian uprising that depicts a
protester holding the Egyptian
flag up as fire blazes around him.
"Catching Fire" 's realism drives
a sharp but welcome turn toward
grittier tones: This is the Hunger
Games all grown-up.

" Five Things: Iowa

Battered and bruised,
this one isn't on Gardner

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
1. Devin Gardner looks hurt.
Michigan's redshirt junior
quarterback has taken a beat-
ing over the last month, dealing
with a struggling offensive line
and an underachieving group of
wide receivers.
After Saturday's 24-21 loss
to Iowa, Gardner seemed to be
dealing with an injury to his
right arm, isolating the append-
age by hooking his right thumb
into his belt loop. When asked
if he was injured, all Gardner

could saywas, "I'm fine."
But clearly, he's not. He
doesn't look like the same play-
er who electrified Michigan's
offense at the beginning of the
season. At times while scram-
bling, he looks tentative.
Gardner finished Saturday's
game with just 98 yards on 13
completions and managed 12
yards on the ground. This is the
same player who combined for
360 yards against Penn State and
584 against Indiana.
It could be a specific shoul-
der injury, or it could be just the
general pain that comes with
getting sacked 20 times in four

games. Whatever it is, it's affect-
ing him, and Michigan's offense
is becoming more and more

matic fash-
ion. On Sunday, the result was

reversed, as the Wolverines lost
to Charlotte in the Puerto Rico
Tip-Off championship game,
63-61, after a put-back by Ter-
rence Williams with 0.4 seconds
remaining.
"We were right there at the
end," said sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas. "We had a great oppor-
tunity to win. It just didn't work
out for us."
After a corner 3-pointer by
freshman forward Zak Irvin cut
the lead to two with 38 seconds
left, Stauskas fouled Williams.
After making the front end of the
one-and-one, Williams missed
the second, giving Michigan a

chance to tie with a triple. But
sophomore guard Caris LeVert
missed from beyond the arc,
forcing the Wolverines (4-2) to
foul again.
That time around, Denzel
Ingram missed the front end of
the one-and-one, and sophomore
guard Spike Albrecht drove
to the hoop. Initiating contact
at the basket, Albrecht's shot
missed, but he earned a trip to
the line. After making the first
free throw, the second hit the
rim - fifth-year senior forward
Jordan Morgan collected it in
the scramble as Michigan called
its final timeout. Morgan col-

lected nine rebounds, including
five offensive ones, in13 minutes
of action.
"I thought it was going in,"
Morgan said. "I just wanted tobe
there just in case it did come off

After a game-tying layup
from sophomore forward Mitch
McGary with less than eight sec-

IOWA CITY -
ach word seemed to
quiver when it came
out of Devin Gardner's
mouth, each syllable so fragile
and tentative one feared it might
crack and
crumble in
the air before
it reached
anyone's ears.
At his press

after another
Michigan
loss, this ZACH

Gardner
covered his
upper lip with his lower one, and
he looked down. In the back of
the room, behind the cameras,
someone opened a door badly in
need of oil. It closed, appropri-
ately, with a high, sad, slow wail.
Gardner and Michigan had
once again taken a pummel-
ing. On the offense's final play,
a Gardner fumble, he stayed on
the ground, his head in the turf,
as - wait. No, sorry. Stop.
Let's not do this again. Let's
not rehash another utterly for-

the first 11 games of Michigan's
season have been a failure. It has
been that way since Michigan
was dismantled and embar-
rassed in a loss to Michigan
State four games ago.
Let's not further belabor the
fact that Michigan's offensive
line is as bad as anyone can
remember. Or that the team has
regressed, or gets out-adjusted
in the second half of each game,
or that Michigan's Big Ten

The Ohio State game has the potential to transform seasons. For Michigan, it's a chance to erase memories of a failed season - and ruising the Buckeyes' undefeated season would be a nice bonus.

football stadium. It's the sum-
mer of 2008 in Dublin, Ohio.
Guy's boss wants him to meet
someone important.
Boss says, "This is David
Katz, he was the photo editor
of The Michigan Daily, and I'm
sorry that we have to bring him
here so close to Columbus."
Boss was Senator Barack
Obama. Even for the future
president of the United States,
with 50,000 people waiting for a
speech, even when introducing
Katz to future Vice President
Joe Biden backstage, the first
thing that came to mind after
"Michigan" was "Ohio State."
Ii111

This is appropriate to tell now
because Michigan is mired in a
season on the fringes of medioc-
rity. On Saturday, it will finish
the regular season with either
a dull 7-5 record, or a dull 8-4
record. But the first thing that
comes to mind for Michigan is
always Ohio State. Did the team
beat the Buckeyes? This year,
that changes everything.
This is a University where
the Peace Corps was conceived,
where polio was cured, where
some student you went to class
with will someday lead some
entity that changes the way
we look at the world. (Hello,

Google. And Twitter.)
And yet, just as much, Michi-
gan's identity is shaped by Ohio
State. It's why, if you ask any
Michigan football player about
their time in Ann Arbor, the
first thing they'll tell you is how
many times they beat the Buck-
eyes. It's why the first thing any
Ohio State player will show you
is his Gold Pants.
And so that's why the best
thing that could've happened
to Michigan in a season that
has jumped the rails is Ohio
State and its undefeated record.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
was asked at his postgame press

conference Saturday what there
was left to play for. The Big Ten
Championship is gone, as is the
10-win season. Even a winning
record in the Big Ten is out the
window.
Hoke didn't pause.
"We got a pretty big rivalry
game next week," he said.
Michigan will be a very large
underdog in that game, and it
should be. If the outcome is still
undecided in the final quarter,
that would count as a minor
upset. Ohio State will probably
win, and then root hard for
Auburn or Florida or anyone
other than Alabama and Florida

State in the conference champi-
onship games.
But if Michigan wins, well...
So let's forget about all that
has happened this year and say
this: thank God for Ohio State.
Thank you, and your BCS-flip-
flopping coach and your Big
Ten-beating offense and your
undefeated record. Especially
your undefeated record. Bless
your undefeated record.
It's the only thing Michigan
has left.

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -
"The Victors" sounds a little dif-
ferent down here.
But every Saturday afternoon
throughout the fall, you'll hear it
in the unlikeliest of settings.
Shannan's Pub - tucked
right off the highway in nearby
Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, away
from the cruise ships and tour-
ist traps that permeate San Juan
- is like any bar you'd find in the
United States. The walls, lined
with green Christmas lights and
Boston Celtics jerseys make it St.
Patrick's Day every day - except
on Saturdays.
Alumni from Penn State, Ohio
State, Florida, Notre Dame and
a host of other schools descend
upon the bar, but the Michigan
game takes center stage.
Thanks to David Del Toro,
a co-director and the official
spokesperson for the University
of Michigan Puerto Rico Spirit
Group, the University's offi-
cial alumni group on the island,
between 40 and 80 alumni and
their families watch their alma
mater on the bar's biggest TV
every week.
"What we try to do is bring
the Michigan environment that
we had in college to the bar and
to Puerto Rico," Del Toro said at
halftime of the Michigan-Iowa
game on Saturday. "We try to
bring people together. It gives
us a chance to... create a college
football environment within the
island."
After each of Michigan's three
touchdowns on Saturday, another
of the club's co-directors, Jason
Arguilo, led the crowd in singing
"The Victors," something it does
after each Wolverine score.
But the fight song - considered
by many the most recognizable
in college sports - has a unique
tinge to it. As Del Toro points out,
it's sung with a bit more pizzazz.
"It's a bit faster - it's not as
paused as it is in the States," he
said. "It's a bit of a local kind of
'Hail to the Victors' for us."
Big Ten and Notre Dame fans
typically dominate the bar on
game days, and if the gridiron

rivalries weren't enough to set
the atmosphere - there's always
"a lot of trash talking," Del Toro
said - most of the viewers have
long-standing relationships.
Arguilo noted that many of the
game-day attendees have been
friends since high school, long
before they went off to Ameri-
can universities. The others are
quickly taken into the fraternity
of college football fanatics.
"Those guys are either already
our friends or become our
friends, so every Saturday, it's
like a brotherhood," Arguilo said.
Added Del
Toro: "You
wear your
colors, you I want
brag about
your school. It to think
brings a col-
lege football an amb
environment o
to Puerto Rico, of M ic
because in all
honesty, we
don't have that
down here. This is kind of used as
our bragging card."
Maize and an island blue
Hector Martinez's custom-
made Puerto Rican flag isn't the
perfect blend of maize and blue -
it was made in a pinch before he,
Arguilo and Del Toro left for last
year's Final Four in Atlanta - but
ithas gained significant notoriety
this week.
Martinez, a 2008 Ross School
of Business graduate and the
third of the Spirit Club's four co-
directors, is part of the base of
young alumni doing their part to
keep the Michigan connection
going strong south of the contigu-
ous border.
Del Toro estimates 450 alumni
live on the island, and because
most Puerto Ricans that go to
Michigan return after gradua-
tion, the number is continually
growing. There are nine Puerto
Rican freshmen at the Univer-
sity this year - one of the largest
classes in recent years.
That's due in large part to the
recruiting efforts of Del Toro's
crew a d
"We want the students to see

some of the perks of going to
Michigan," Del Toro said. "We
try to start the whole process of
getting to be a'Michigan Man' -
a fanatic."
Each August, Del Toro hosts a
send-off barbecue weeks before
the freshmen head to Ann Arbor.
Most of the current students join
the alumni group, giving the
incoming freshmen a network
both on the island for internships
and jobs, and at school to ease the
difficult transition - something
that wasn't available to Del Toro
when he left for school in the mid
1990s.
"They get
to get tips on
people classes and
where to live
of me as and little
things - and
assador it's fun. We
can already
[igan." see they're a
nice and unit-
ed crew," Del
Toro said.
Del Toro, a banker, is some-
thing of a local legend. During
lunch at a local restaurant prior
to Michigan's opening-round
game, he seemed to know every
customer and most of the wait
staff. It's his outgoing personali-
ty, he says, that made him perfect
for the job as an alumni coordina-
tor.
"I would always tell this to
people, when I was at Michigan
that I wanted people to think of
Puerto Rico and think of me as an
ambassador," he said. "When I'm
in Puerto Rico, I want people to
think of me as an ambassador of
Michigan. I enjoy people think-
ing, Michigan - David down
here."
Creating a home away from home
The Michigan Alumni Associ-
ation's traveling party easily out-
numbered any of the other seven
schools in the Puerto Rico Tip-
Off. But the Wolverines' biggest
home-court advantage inside the
Coliseo Roberto Clemente was
the fans who call the island home.
The group's various instru-
ments - cowbells, drums and a
set of other noisemakers - along

with a series of Spanish chants
could be heard clearly through
television sets nationwide.
"The most gratifying thing
for me has been for our group,
particularly our cheering sec-
tion at the stadium, has made its
presence felt and made a differ-
ence," Arguilo said. "We're very,
very proud Michigan alums, and
we're thrilled that we're having a
chance to put on a show."
A few of the coaches' wives
have approached Del Toro, ask-
ing what the chants mean.
Many of them are what he
calls bombas, and have a Christ-
mas theme to them - the holiday
on the predominantly Catholic
island is very drawn out. Though
Del Toro admits it doesn't com-
pletely correlate to the English
translation, one means roughly,
'Tomorrowmorning, I'mgoingto
take flowers to your house.'
But others, he said, "aren't
kosher."
"It's a good thing we were
chanting in Spanish, so they
wouldn't understand," Martinez
added.
At one point during the Flor-
ida State game, after two warn-
ings over the public address
system, Martinez and others
were warned by an official that
Michigan would receive a tech-
nical foul if they continued to
play their noisemakers. "But we
kept on doing it anyway," Arguilo
noted. (The Wolverines never
received a foul.)
But for the lively band of alum-
ni in Puerto Rico, Michigan's trip
provided a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity - one they hope will
add to the University's image on
the island, and one they certainly
won't soon forget.
"We're a bit loud-ish, a little bit
in your face, but we've certainly
enjoyed mixing the U of M chants
that you would normally get in
the Big House or in Crisler (Cen-
ter) with the typical chants that
you would get at sporting events
down here," Del Toro said.
Added Arguilo: "We might not
be great in numbers, but to have
our own little local Maize Rage
with a Puerto Rican flavor, that
has really been for me, the best
part."

5 Things We Learned: Niagara

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
1. The freshmen are ready for the
Big Ten.
The Michigan hockey team's
freshmen combined for seven
points in the Wolverines' 6-0 win
over Niagara on Friday and have
recorded points in each contest
this season.
It took freshman forward Tyler
Motte just 34 seconds to score the
first of No. 5 Michigan's six goals
on the night.
Motte's goal was his fifth of the
season, and his first in six games.
He finished with a team-leading
three points after tallying two
assists.
Motte was one of four fresh-
men, and seven Wolverines in all,
to contribute to the six-goal scor-
ing effort.
"It was good to see him on the
scoring sheet again," said Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson.
Midway through the second
period, forward Alex Kile sent a
rebound from senior forward Luke
Moffatt into the back of the net for
his first career goal. Kile was the
final freshman forward to register
a goal this season, with the excep-
tion of Max Shuart, whose first
career start came Friday.
JT Compher, whose first two
career goals came last weekend
against Nebraska-Omaha, added
two assists while defenseman
Michael Downing had one.
Goaltender Zach Nagelvoort
has already shown he is ready for
big-time, Big Ten hockey, but after
a strong showing Friday, it seems
the rest of Michigan's freshmen
are ready as well.
2. Michigan can do it five-on-five.
In fact, five of the Wolverines'
season-high six goals against
Niagara came on even-man oppor-
tunities.
Prior to Friday, Michigan's
offense was ranked 31st in the
country - significantlylower than
its top-10 ranking would suggest.

The offense relied heavily on one
of the nation's strongest power
plays. And though Michigan is
7-1-1 when recording power-play
tallies, even-strength goals will be
the difference in close, one-goal
games.
"We've had some success as
a team, but a lot of it has been
our special teams," Berenson
said. "We've had some guys who
haven't scored at all."
The Wolverineswere also aided
by a rule implemented after last
season. After Motte tripped and
fell, dislodging the Niagara net
from its moorings, sophomore
forward Andrew Copp netted his
first of two goals on the night. The
subsequent review reversed the
initial no-goal call. Last year, the
score would have been automati-
cally waved off with the net off its
posts.
"Five even-strength goals is
really important for our team
going forward, and I think it gives
us alotof confidence goinginto Big
Ten play next week," Copp said.
3. Nagelvoort gets the nod.
Both goaltenders - Nagelvoort
and sophomore Steve Racine -
made a start onthe road last week-
end against Nebraska-Omaha.
Each gave up three goals, but it
was Nagelvoort who earned a loss
when the offense couldn't bail him
out.
So heading into a one-game
weekend against Niagara - the
first of the season - only one of
Michigan's two starting goalies
would get the nod.
Nagelvoort made the most of
his opportunity, securing 36 saves
en route to his first career shutout.
"We've had really high-intensi-
ty practices and having the com-
petition with a guy like myself
and Racine, two really good goal-
ies who are always battling and
constantly playing against each
other," Nagelvoort said. "Just hav-
ing two guys like that is better."
It was the first shutout at Yost
Ice Arena since December of last
season.

Still, Berenson won't admit to
picking a favorite quite yet.
"(Nagelvoort) got the benefit of
this game, and he took advantage
of it," Berenson said. "But I'm not
calling anyone No.1 at this point."
4. Home-ice advantage exists.
Having scored four goals in a
pair of weekend games against
Boston University and UMass-
Lowell, and five goals in two
contests against Michigan Tech,
Berenson spoke about taking
advantage of Yost Ice Arena.
On Friday, Michigan snapped
its streak of seven straight one-
goal contests - the longest streak
in the nation - and scored more
goals in one night than it had in
any given weekend at home this
season.
The Wolverines also scored
twice in the first period, another
first for an offense that has strug-
gled at home. Michigan has out-
scored opponents 11-2 this season
in the first period.

5. Defense could be Michigan's
weakness.
Despite the shutout, the defense
allowed 36 shots, several of which
forced Nagelvoort to defend the
Wolverines' leadby himself.
In particular, junior defense-
man Brennan Serville was beaten
several times in the defensive
zone.
"Too many turnovers, too many
grade-A chances," Berenson said.
"Some of them weren't defensive
responsibility, but our defense has
to play better."
Though Downing registered an
assist Friday, the defense as a unit
has been largely ineffective on
offense, having failed to register a
goal all season.
The penalty kill finished 2-for-
2 and has killed a respectable 84.6
percent of man-up chances this
season. Still, without freshman
defenseman Evan Allen, who is
out at least three months with a
knee injury, the defense will need
to step up against the conference's
toughest competitors.


FIVE
From Page 1B
do a lot of things that Toussaint
can't.
The now-230-pounder, at the
very least, falls forward when he's
hit. There is no driving him back
behind the line.
And with a struggling offensive
line that earned negative rush-
ing yards in consecutive weeks,
Green's ability to not get driven
behind the line of scrimmage can't
be overlooked.
In a season of miscues and
disappointments, Green's devel-
opment from an out-of-shape

fifth-string running back into a
legitimate option for the future is
one of the few bright spots.
3. Michigan's defense will carry
this team next year.
Really, the only thing keeping it
from carrying this team right now
is an offense that's beyond incom-
petent. If the offense was capable
- just bare-minimum capable -
then this defense could be getting
more attention on a national level.
Next year, it's going to be even
better, because Michigan is only
graduating three starting defend-
ers. On Saturday, redshirt fresh-
man defensive lineman Willie

Henry had perhaps the best game
of his college career. Redshirt
junior linebacker Jake Ryan was
all overthe field and forced a pick-
six. The Wolverines forced three
interceptions.
There wasn't much else the
defense could've done to win this
game.
The unit is only going to get
more experienced, so watch out
in 2014.
4. Michigan is not going to be a
strong bowl draw this year.
In years past, bowl committees
given a chance to take a team with
a better record have chosen the

Wolverines. The reasoning was
that Michigan's fan base would
travel well no matter what - the
Michigan football brand was still
going strong.
This year, that's not so certain.
Three teams with similar records
and bowl aspirations - Iowa,
Minnesota and Nebraska - will
likely be chosen over the Wolver-
ines. Part of that is a credit to the
other programs' fan bases, but
part of that is because Michigan
fans are fed up.
Ticket prices for the Ohio State
game have fallen to less than $100.
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
received a death threat on Twit-
ter. People are calling for the fir-

ing of offensive coordinator Al
Borges.
So if Michigan makes the Buf-
falo Wild Wings Bowl, or the
Heart of Dallas Bowl, or the Texas
Bowl, the same contingent likely
isn't going to flood those areas
anymore. Why would they? It's a
lost season, clearly.
Brandon has done his damnd-
est to make sure the Michigan
"brand" stays strong, but the real-
ity is that nothing is more impor-
tant than a record and fans who
believe the record has a shot at
improving. In 2013, that isn't the
case.
5. Bold Prediction: Shane Morris

will see at least one snap against
Ohio State.
If Gardner is hurting and
Michigan is taking a beating late
in the game, why wouldn't Mor-
ris see game action? His redshirt
is already burned unless there's
an injury that the team hasn't dis-
closed, which doesn't seem likely.
At some point, it becomes cruel
to let Gardner take the same big
hits over and over again, espe-
cially if the game is already out of
reach.
The more experience Mor-
ris gets, the better, especially if it
gives Gardner a chance to rest his
aches.


GARDNER
From Page 1B
Two months ago, Gardner was
what his high school coach called
a riverboat gambler. He was a
turnover machine - leading the
country in giveaways for much of
the season - but capable of four
to five plays a game that could
only be made by a handful of col-
lege quarterbacks.
It never looked like he was
really sprinting. It was more
graceful than that. He hadn't yet
figured out how to combine the
athletic ability with the decision
making, but once he did, look out.
We saw a little bit of the old
Gardner in overtime of the
Northwestern game last week,
just a glimpse, and it looked nice.
It won the Wolverines the game.
It was just a glimpse, though, a
murmur.
Now, with Michigan's funeral
procession of a season spiraling
down into the last game, Gardner
is a shell of himself. There aren't
flashy plays or insane athletic
feats. Instead, there are plays like
one in the fourth quarter on Sat-
urday, when Gardner was drilled
on a failed third-down conver-
sion pass and took more than 10
seconds to get off the turf With-
out any Wolverines around, he
needed a ref to help him off the
turf. He half-jogged, half-limped
off the field with his head down.
This isn't the Devin Gardner
we used to know, the one that
made anything seem possible,
good or bad. Instead of big

scramble attempts throughthe
heart of the defense that ended
with either a big hit or a big
gain, Gardner heads toward the
sidelines whenever a scramble
opportunity presents itself.
Whatever it was thatche used
to have - a swagger, a confi-
dence, an "it" - isn't there any-
more.
And it's not his fault. At all.
Gardner has been playing
with an offensive line that got
him sacked 19 times in the three
games before Saturday. He's
taken an absolute beating, and
even the toughest quarterbacks
can only get hit so manytimes
before the idea of getting bashed
on every pass attempt enters
their consciousness. He's also
playing with an underwhelming
group of wide receivers - he has
two legitimate receiving options,
and one of them, sophomore tight
end Devin Funchess, dropped
three passes on Saturday.
He's also been taking flak
and criticism after almost every
game this year. Early on, he was
too aggressive. Then, he became
too passive. The interceptions
dropped, but so did the big plays.
Maybe the constant chirping got
to him.
On Saturday, he threw for 98
yards and ran for 12 despite only
being sacked once. For the player
he was at the beginning of the
season, that would have been a
good quarter, or maybe a half.
Next week, in The Game,
Ohio State would be tough even
if Michigan had Tom Brady at
quarterback. This is a lost sea-

son, where Michigan's goals
have been whittled from "Big
Ten Championship" to "Playing
for 10 wins" to "Playing for our
seniors."
But for Michigan to have any
chance, whether it's against
the Buckeyes or in the Heart of
Texas Bowl or even next season,
the Wolverines need to reclaim
their Gardner.
At this point, the player who
led the country in interceptions
would be a welcome sight for a
team that needs playmakers, big
plays and their riverboat gambler
back more than anything.

HEARTBREAKER
From Page 1B
lotte (5-1) made the second half's
first three baskets to push it to 12.
Michigan found itself trailing
thanks in part to LeVert miss-
ing the final 18 minutes of the
first half after drawing two quick
fouls. Sophomore forward Glenn
Robinson III also missed the final
17 minutes of the game after suf-
fering a hard fall on his back on a
first-half foul. Robinson attempt-
ed to play in the second half, but
Michigan coach John Beilein
pulled him when it was clear he
wasn't comfortable on the court.
"We tried to get him in there as
much as we could," Beilein said.
"The advice from the trainers was
keep him going and after the first
time, we could see even when he
was out there he wasn't moving,
and it was going to be a very, very
physical game. And so it wasn't
worth it to risk further injury."
Without LeVert in the first
half, the offense ran through
Stauskas - the tournament MVP
- and he did his part, scoring 16
of his team-high 20 points, while
playing all 20 minutes. But Michi-
gan trailed from the 16:55 marker
onward due to a field goal drought
until Albrecht converted a layup
with 6:50 left.
In place of LeVert, trying to
fill the offensive void was Irvin.
But he wasn't much help, shoot-
ing 1-for-9 in the half, with his
only make coming on a 3-pointer
with 21 seconds left. Despite his
off night from the field, 3-for-

14 shooting with eight points,
Beilein was happy with what the
6-foot-6 guard brought.
"I liked that Zak Irvin didn't
stop shooting even though he
couldn't make a shot," Beilein
said. "Because he had a huge one
for us late and a huge one in the
first half. So these are all things I
see positives from the loss."
But like Friday's game, the
Wolverines clawed back. Final-
ly scoring its first points of the
half with 15:48 remaining on a
layup from fifth-year senior for-
ward Jordan Morgan, Michigan
hopped on the comeback trail
once again.
LeVert, out of foul trouble,
played the entire second half,
scoring 11 points, including a
3-pointer that brought the Wol-
verines within one with 11:43
remaining. LeVert would eventu-
ally give Michigan its first lead
since the first half with 6:12 left

on a pair of free throws.
But Michigan would relin-
quish the lead with 5:26 left after
McGary, who had six points
and nine rebounds, picked up
his fourth foul. The Wolverines
never regained the lead - they
came back to tie the game after
Charlotte opened a five-point
advantage, but got no further.
Trading baskets from then on
out, the 49ers took advantage of
McGary's fear of drawing a fifth
foul when he reentered the game
with 3:37 remaining.
The fifth foul never came, but
Michigan suffered an even worse
fate as its hopes of bringing home
a trophy in 2013 were quashed.
While the loss stings for the
players, Beilein tried toput a posi-
tive spin on it as best as he could.
"We had adversity tonight like
we haven't had," he said. "And we
just kept plugging away, so it's all
good."

Ryan's optimism pays off

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
It was a bad loss, and Michigan
coach Greg Ryan was still happy.
Twelve days ago, the Michigan
women's soccer team suffered a
1-0 loss to the Big Ten's No.7 seed,
Iowa, in the first round of the Big
Ten Tournament. The Wolver-
ines had beaten the Hawkeyes in
the regular season and then lost
their chance at a tournament title.
Ryan was ... happy?
Some coaches nitpick and find
something wrong with every one
of their teams' performances.
Ryan does the opposite, even after
his team loses a game it shouldn't.
In Michigan's first loss this
season against Butler, he said it
did its best to handle the Bull-
dogs' five-defender formation. In
its second loss against Minnesota,
he said it had the majority of the
chances. In its third loss against
Iowa, he said it would get to
rest instead of playing two more
games.
His players are listening to his
confidence.
"You have to not just want it,
but believe that you can do it,"
senior midfielder Meghan Toohey
said. "That's what makes a good
team a great team - knowing on
the field that you're going to win."
Ryan is nothesitant to exagger-
ate, either. After the team's sec-
ond exhibition in August, he said
freshman goalie Taylor Bucklin
was already where graduated
four-year starter Haley Kopmey-
er was in her third or fourth year.
Perhaps the only reason he hasn't

called record-breaking goal
scorer Nkem Ezurike the best
player he's ever coached is that he
coached Abby Wambach on the
U.S. Women's National Team.
Then, as he sat in the men's
locker room at U-M Soccer Sta-
dium on Saturday after the Wol-
verines' impressive, but expected,
3-0 victory over Illinois State, he
made two more proud statements.
"I would coach this group of
players for the rest of my life if I
could," Ryan said. "I would never
make another change. I would
just keep these guys. To me, that's
the most rewarding thing.
"I think we've had a lot of
great games this year, and games
where certain parts of our team
were just outstanding, butI think
tonight was maybe the most com-
plete game we've played all year
long."
Sunday, when the Wolver-
ines clinched a berth in the Elite
Eight, was the best day in Ryan's
six years at Michigan.
These glowing statements may
be heat-of-the-moment exaggera-
tions. Except one thing: they're
working.
Sunday, the Wolverines chased
Notre Dame all over, pressur-
ing them into submission. At one
point, the Fighting Irish con-
trolled the ball deep in their own
half, until Ezurike and sopho-
more forward Corinne Harris ran
at them and forced them to kick it
out of bounds. When Notre Dame
lost a player to a red card in the
70th minute, Michigan took full
control.
The Wolverines were devas-

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan coach Greg Ryan has kept Michigan even throughout the season.

ELITE
From Page 1B
Friday, Michigan (9-1-1 Big Ten,
18-3-1 overall) completed a 3-0
shutout victory over Illinois State
before adding another with a 1-0
victory over Notre Dame on Sun-
day.
It was Michigan's first meeting
withthe FightingIrish (7-5-1ACC,
13-8-1) since 2008, when the team
suffered a 7-0 loss in Ryan's first
game as the Michigan coach.
Michigan scored within the
first five minutes of its last two
games, but it took until the second
half toetally againstNotre Dame. A
corner kick broughtthe ball inside
the 18-yard box, where it touched
the hand of a Fighting Irish player,
earning the Wolverines a penalty
kick.
Senior midfielder Meghan
Toohey emerged from a group
huddle and stepped up totake the
shot. She took one step and nudged
a slow-roller into the bottom right
of the net. The goalie didn't even
move.
"Toohey has been our most
consistent finisher," Ryan said. "I
had 100-percent confidence that
she was going to score."
The lone goal was all the Wol-
verines needed to earn their 12th
shutout victory this season, a pro-
gram record. But Michigan kept
trying to capitalize nonetheless,
and outshot the Fighting Irish,
22-10.
Though normally efficient, a
frustrated senior forward Nkem
Ezurike couldn't get a good touch
on the ball and missed five shots
on goal. When freshman forward
Madisson Lewis was tripped on a
breakaway, the Wolverines earned
another penalty kick, but Ezurike
missed left of the net.

Meanwhile, Notre Dame
couldn't create many quality
chances. Its best chance at put-
ting Michigan in a deficit came in
the ninth minute when midfielder
Morgan Andrews rocketed the
ball off the crossbar.
The Wolverines relied on their
defense to put the game away.
Freshman goalie Taylor Bucklin
needed to make just four saves.
"We have maybe the best
defense in the country," Ryan said.
Michigan's triumph over the
Fighting Irish ties its season win
record at 18. The Wolverines have
gone 10-0 at home in the NCAA
Tournament all-time.
Before facing Notre Dame,
Michigan first had to go through
Illinois State (6-0 Missouri Valley,
14-7-1). The Wolverines blanked
the Redbirds on Friday night, 3-0.
Michigan's first goal came just
two-and-a-half minutes into the
game. Sophomore Midfielder
Christina Ordonez lofted the ball
to freshman forward Madisson
Lewis, who headed the ball to the
far post right over the hands of
goalkeeper Aryn Newsom.
After 45 minutes, Michigan
wasn't satisfied with the one-goal
advantage, and Ezurike fixed that
five minutes into the second half.
She received a pass on the end line
from Toohey, turned to her right
away from a defender, and struck
the ball with her left foot, scoring
from an almost impossible angle.
The goal made Ezurike the pro-
gram's all-time points leader with
117.
Just 13 minutes later, senior
defender Holly Hein added an
insurance goal by heading a cor-
ner kick from Zadorsky into the
left side of the net.
"You can't be content," Hein
said. "You have to keep going at
them."

tated on Sept. 29 after a 1-0 loss to
Minnesota, a team that went on to
be the No. 8 seed in the Big Ten.
The Wolverines took 18 shots, but
only five were on goal and none
went in the net.
But Ryan kept their heads
up and encouraged them, and
Michigan won its next eight
games, inserting itself back into
the Big Ten race. Then came the
loss to Iowa, which, to the play-
ers, seemed like a setback after
the Wolverines came in with title
aspirations. But to Ryan?
"I had to try and act really dis-
appointed after the game, but I
knew that it would give us a tre-
mendous opportunity to recover
physically and mentally," he said.
He was right. Michigan is back
in midseason form, the only Big
Ten team left standing heading
into the Elite Eight. The last time
Michigan played Notre Dame

was 2008, Ryan's first season,
when the Fighting Irish ham-
mered Michigan, 7-0. Ryan said
the team ate breakfast Sunday
and was sure it was going to win.
It showed on the field.
This success is Ryan's goal, no
matter what he has to do or say.
When asked Friday about his for-
mation, he gave a vague answer.
"I don't know what we're play-
ing," Ryan said. "Sometimes it's
a 4-5-1, sometimes it's a 4-3-3,
sometimes it turns into a 4-4-2."
Added senior defender Holly
Hein: "One time, I think it was
just, 'Go."'
For now, Ryan will stick with
his optimism, because it has his
team packing itsbags for Charlot-
tesville, Va. What he does know is
this: Michigan is in the Elite Eight
for the first time since 2002, and
that's not an exaggeration.
