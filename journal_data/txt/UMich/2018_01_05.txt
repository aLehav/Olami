This spring, the city of Ann 

Arbor will welcome a cohort of 
25 residents for its inaugural 
“Citizens 
Academy”. 
The 

program aims to broaden civic 
understanding and offer Ann 
Arbor residents a perspective 
into the functioning of local 
government.

Over 
the 
course 
of 
six 

weeks from March 28 to May 
2, 
participants 
will 
have 

the chance to attend weekly 
sessions 
covering 
topics 

ranging from the mechanics 
behind 
city 
budgeting 
to 

water quality. Each week’s 
session will meet at a different 
location 
ranging 
from 
the 

Water Treatment Plant to the 
Communication 
Television 

Network offices. 

The initial idea for an Ann 

Arbor Citizens Academy came 
from the popular Ann Arbor 
Citizens’ 
Police, 
Fire 
and 

Courts Academy, established 
in 
2008, 
which 
provide 

citizens the opportunity to 
engage 
with 
public 
safety 

operations. 
AAPFCA 
has 

been well received by the 
community according to Ann 
Arbor Police Service Specialist 
Jamie Giordano, who has been 
at the helm of the program for 
the past two years. The success 
of 
the 
AAPFCA, 
Giordano 

said, can be seen with the 
participants’ 
willingness 
to 

contribute to the city and their 

community.

“Last year in our group we 

had many of the members 
that were part of our group 
also were part of the Citizens 
Emergency 
Response 
Team 

program, so they’re are helping 
out the community in that 
way. Many of them went on to 
become neighborhood watch 
captains, so they are a liaison 
between the police department 
and their neighborhoods 
to bridge the gap and get 
information out into the 
community and from the 
community to us. Sharing 
their experiences helps the 
relationship between our 
department and the city,” 
Giordano said.

The application process 

includes two components. 
The first component is 
a 
required 
application 

form 
with 
two 
short 

answer 
questions. 
The 

second component is an 
optional photo challenge 
where applicants have the 
opportunity to send photos 
of themselves at various 
Ann 
Arbor 
landmarks. 

Applications are due on 
March 2 by 5 p.m.

The city has provided 

a detailed explanation of 
the selection process on 
their website. Applicants 
must be eighteen years 
old to apply. Ann Arbor 
residents and those who 
indicate they can attend 
all 
meetings 
will 
be 

given preference in the 

application review. A point-
based system will be used to 
identify the top 25 scoring 
participants who will then be 
offered a spot in the Citizens 
Academy.

Ann Arbor resident Kathy 

Griswold applauded the effort 
by the city to create a citizens 
council, but has reservations 
concerning 
the 
application 

process.

“On the surface it sounds 

like 
an 
excellent 
goal. 

In 
looking 
through 
the 

application process and how 
selective they plan to be, I 
am a little concerned about 
whether they are going to be 
selecting citizens that could 
be like-minded and use this 
as a development for potential 
council candidates who agree 
with the majority,” she said.

Ann Arbor resident Mary 

Morgan, 
the 
founder 
of 

the 
CivCity 
Initiative, 
a 

nonpartisan 
nonprofit 
with 

the mission to increase civic 
participation 
within 
Ann 

Arbor, was excited about the 
announcement of a Citizens 
Academy 
and 
believes 
it 

is too early to tell if there 
are 
consequences 
to 
the 

application requirement.

Thus far, the University of 

Michigan hasappeared in 12 
alleged 
incidents 
of 
sexual 

harassment and assault taken 
from acrowdsourced database 
circulating 
in 
academic 

communities.

Since December, over 2,000 

individuals 
from 
academic 

institutions in the United States 
and abroad have responded to 
the sexual harassment survey 
created 
by 
Karen 
Kelsky, 

founder 
of 
the 
academic 

career-advisory business The 
Professor is In. The anonymous 
contributors who shared their 
stories range from students to 
professors. 
Perpetrators, 
all 

anonymous and in academia, 
also have also contributed to the 
survey.

The 12 alleged incidents 

centered at the University vary 
in demographics and situation 
–– and some of the incidents 
date back to the 1980s. The 
unidentified 
sources 
wrote 

about 
inappropriate 
sexual 

advances, sexist comments and 
rapes.

Entries ranged from “raped 

during my PhD program” to 
tenured 
professors 
“serially 

groping” students. According 
to the log, of the four cases 
that were allegedly reported at 
the University, investigations 
were launched for two of them, 
and only one incident ended 
in disciplinary action. Many 
entries do not mention specific 
dates, but some refer to incidents 
that allegedly occurred in the 
last decade.

shouldn’t have agreed to come

In new academic environments, first-generation students must navigate structural hurdles 

Taubman sophomore Wendy 

Zhuo moved herself into college. 
She bid farewell to her parents 
and hopped on a train from Boston 
to Ann Arbor. When she arrived, 
four suitcases in tow, she had no 
idea where she was. Eventually 
she called a taxi, which then 
dropped her and her belongings at 
her dorm.

Zhuo is part of the 8 percent of 

first-generation 
undergraduate 

students 
at 
the 
University, 

according to the 2016 Campus 
Climate 
Survey 
on 
Diversity, 

Equity, and Inclusion, and her 
story is just one of many that 
first-generation 
students 
have 

to tell. Navigating the complex 
academic and social environment 
of college is difficult enough, 
but it is compounded by a lack of 
parental guidance and, in the case 
of many first-generation college 
students, a low-income status. 
According to a 2017 report from 
the National Center for Education 
Statistics, 27 percent of first-

generation students come from 
homes making $20,000 a year or 
less, whereas only six percent of 
continuing-generation 
students 

do.

The setbacks these students face 

can create feelings of isolation and 
dissatisfaction with the campus 
climate, as shown in the results 
of the University’s 2016 Campus 
Climate 
Survey 
on 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion. To combat 
these struggles, the University has 
various resources and programs 
to help first-generation students 
throughout their college careers.

Adan 
Hussain, 
a 
first-

generation project manager in the 
Office of Academic Multicultural 
Initiatives, detailed the four major 
events he oversees: a student and 
parent open house at the start of 
the year, two large community 
dinners and a first-generation 
graduation ceremony.

“The major goal is community 

building, so that first-gen students 
can meet other first-gens who 
might be like them, or who might 
not be like them,” Hussain said. 
“Meeting both is just really

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind 
the scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, 
LSA freshman Riley Langefeld covered the end of net 
neutrality and its impact on the University.

“It affects people in more ways than they would think. And 
I don’t think the proportionate attention has been paid to 
this issue, so it was gratifying to bring attention to it in a 
way that a lot of people can see. I thought it was pretty cool 
that we don’t go through Yousef’s press office or anything 
–– I just kind of texted him, on his cell phone, which was 
weird. But I also have never interviewed an actual politician 
or representative of any kind before, and since that’s a field I 
want to go into, it was really interesting to get some firsthand 
conversation with a guy like that.“

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
We know that students’ feelings of recognition and 

belonging are strongly correlated to their ability to learn...
we emphasize the importance of all students feeling 
valued and respected and the ways that systemic 
inequities (such racism, sexism, wealth inequity) and 
patterns of bias (such as homophobia, Islamophobia, 
xenophobia, etc.) create disparate experiences for 
different students.“

Theresa Braunschneider, Associate Director and Coordinator of Diversity Initiatives at the Center for Research on Learning 
and Teaching

A situation the Detroit Free 

Press initially reported as a single 
missing cow roaming around 
northeast Ann Arbor is actually 
significantly 
more 
dangerous 

than 
previously 
thought. 

Derrick Jackson, the director 
of community engagement for 
the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s 
Office, confirmed the animal at 
large Thursday afternoon was not 
just one cow, but two steer –– the 
beefier, male counterpart of the 
cow. 

“They are both around 1,500 

pounds apiece –– both fairly 
aggressive,” Jackson said. “And 
really why we put the message out 
was to let people know that we’re 
in the area looking for the two 
steer. But if you see it, definitely 
don’t approach thinking it’s just 
a cow that’s harmless, because 
they’re very large, and could be 
pretty dangerous.”

The two steer escaped while 

being transported in a trailer by 
their owners. When the vehicle 
stopped, the trailer door –– which 
had not been properly secured –– 
swung open.

“The steer literally just walked 

off the trailer,” Jackson said. “And 
they were near some residential 
areas, so we initially got quite a 
few calls just from neighbors and 
drivers and passerby saying, ‘Hey, 
there are these two very large 
cows kind of roaming the area.’”

After the owners were located, 

they informed deputies it would 
be too difficult to corral and 
recapture the steer, and requested 
instead they put them down. A 
few hours after the sheriff’s office 
initially reported the situation 
at 1:36 p.m., Jackson confirmed 
deputies had located and killed 
one of the steers. As of the time of 
this report, the other remains on 
the lam.

couch.”
One 
anonymous 
graduate 

student 
described 
the 

ramifications on their mental 
health after an incident with 
their former professor.

“It has taken years to heal 

from the trauma of being taken 
advantage of by a professor who 
claimed he had my best interests 
in mind. I still have to see him 
in the hallways and it is very 
triggering. It was like a slow, 
drawn out assault over many 
months of the school year,” they 
wrote.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
interview the University knows 
of the existence of the database 
and is monitoring it regularly.

“We are aware of this blog 

and staff in the university’s 
Office for Institutional Equity 
check it regularly for allegations 
that reference U-M,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “They look carefully at 
the information that is provided 
to determine if there is any 
action that can or should be 
taken by the university.”

The status of the University-

affiliated 
contributors 
range 

from 
an 
undergraduate 

sophomore to

visiting 
lecturers. 
One 

common factor was the gender 
of their harasser: All of the 
incidents cited were perpetrated 
by male faculty. The gender of 
all reported perpetrators are 
overwhelmingly male, with only 
roughly 5 percent of reported 
harassers women.

High-profile figures, many 

men, in politics, entertainment 
and media have faced serious 
sexual-misconduct 
allegations 

in the final months of 2017 
— ousting many from their 
positions. 
The 
#MeToo 

movement, 
originating 
from 

actress Alyssa Milano’s tweet 
encouraging survivors to speak 

out, is at the forefront of national 
conversations around sexism.

Sexual 
harassment 
cases 

at the University more than 
doubled in 2017 from 25 to 
60 incidents reported to the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, according to 
the University’s annual public 
safety report. Sexual assault 
incidents increased from 124 to 
125 cases in the same year. 

When asked about how the 

University is combating sexual 
harassment in the wake of 
#MeToo — including a flood of 
charges at universities around 
the country from Michigan 
State’s 
gymnastics 
program 

to the University of Arizona’s 
firing 
of 
former 
Michigan 

football coach Rich Rodriguez 
— Fitzgerald did not mention 
any new scrutiny on harassment. 
He referred The Daily to its 
own stories on the University’s 
history of misconduct policies.

“The Daily has numerous 

stories in its archives on the 
longstanding policies against 
sexual 
misconduct 
and 
the 

extensive 
educational 
efforts 

that are in place on our campus 
to help students, faculty and 
staff understand and combat 
sexual misconduct.” he wrote.

Sociology graduate student 

Nicole Bedera studies college 
sexual violence and masculinity. 
Bedera said she was neither 
surprised when she saw the 
database, nor when she heard the 
percentage of women harassers.

“We know that the vast 

majority of harassers and sexual 
assailants are men,” Bedera 
said. “Which doesn’t mean that 
women don’t engage in these 
practices, they absolutely do, but 
one of the central reasons people 
engage in sexual harassment or 
assault behavior is masculinity. 
It’s a gendered crime.”

Bedera 
referred 
to 
the 

database as a “whisper network,” 
a hushed chain of conversations 
between women about men 
regarding rumors, allegations 

or known incidents of sexual 
misconduct, 
harassment 
or 

assault.

“The only thing that makes 

this list different from it is that 
it’s written down somewhere so 
that everybody can see who is on 
the whisper network, including 
those who are being whispered 
about,” Bedera said.

Incidents reported in the 

log occuring at the University 
described 
the 
disruption 
of 

everyday life for survivors. Three 
contributors noted they were 
less trusting of men in general 
following incidents, and would 
avoid social situations with their 
male colleagues. As a whole, 
survivors 
cited 
irreversible 

impacts on their careers. 

“I don’t sit next to male 

faculty/colleagues 
if 
I 
can 

help it and I avoid any events 
where drinking is involved,” a 
contributor wrote. 

“I’m 
not 
sure 
whether 

this 
would 
be 
considered 

harassment,” one contributor 
wrote of a professor asking 
her for a kiss. “It did make me 
feel uncomfortable and ended 
any future potential research 
collaborations.

Fitzgerald wrote to the Daily 

that students should not hesitate 
to report incidents of this nature.

“It also is important to know 

that we always encourage anyone 
who has experienced sexual 
harassment or sexual assault or 
is aware of someone who has 
experienced sexual harassment 
or sexual assault to contact the 
Office for Institutional Equity 
so those experiences can be 
investigated 
and 
appropriate 

action taken,” he wrote.

Kelsky’s list shares some 

similarities with the “Sh*tty 
Men in Media” list, which is an 
anonymous database centered 
in the New York City media and 
publishing community. 

powerful. The other is getting 
connected to resources and things 
that folks may not have known 
about before.”

Dwight Lang, faculty adviser 

of the University group First-
Generation 
College 
Students 

at 
Michigan, 
said 
the 
first-

generation students he has talked 
to over the years claim their 
freshman year was the hardest. 
As a first-generation student 
himself, he helps students adjust 
to college life, and connect them 
to the University and each other.

“So many first-gens I’ve talked 

to who’ve had problems, it’s 
always been the first year,” Lang 
said. “Many of them have said 
they just wanted to flee the place 
because it was just so foreign 
to them. But they have made 
a decision to come to college, 
so I tell them to try to find a 
reference group where people can 
understand them. Maybe find a 
staff person or a faculty member, 
a peer, someone they can talk to 
about your experiences.”

Mia 
McCrumb, 
a 
first-

generation business freshman, 
said 
her 
biggest 
challenge 

arriving at the University was 
having no expectations as to what 
college would be like. This was a 
stark contrast, she noted, to her 
continuing-generation friends at 
the University. She said they knew 
what to expect because it was 
always assumed they would go to 
college.

“I never knew that I was 

going to come to Michigan and 
I feel so extremely blessed to be 
here,” McCrumb said. “I’ve just 
definitely worked so hard to be 
where I’m at. And I think other 
people have always grown up 
knowing they’re going to come 
here. It’s a very big deal; it wasn’t 
planned for me and it wasn’t 
expected for me either.”

For LSA senior Hunter Zhao, 

president 
of 
First-Generation 

College Students at Michigan, he 
felt his biggest issues were with 
taking advantage of opportunities 
offered at the University and 
with not relating to continuing-
generation students from more 
privileged backgrounds.

“It was a two-pronged thing,” 

Zhao said. “On one side there 
was that social aspect of trying 
to connect with kids who really 
didn’t understand the experiences 
that I was coming from. The 

second 
part 
was 
the 
more 

technical aspect of not seeing 
value outside of just getting my 
degree.”

According to Lang, Zhao’s 

bewilderment when trying to 
relate with wealthier students 
is not uncommon among first-
generation 
students. 
Lang 

explained that first-generation 
students’ decision to attend college 
is simultaneously a decision to 
ascend to a higher socioeconomic 
status. This isn’t apparent to these 
students when they enter college; 
Lang said gradually their upward 
socioeconomic mobility starts to 
manifest itself, which can cause 
tension between them and their 
families.

“I encourage the first-gens that 

are in our group to get to know 
middle- and upper-class peers 
because they’re going to have to 
adjust to this new social class they 
want to be a part of,” Lang said. 
“They all want to be upwardly 
mobile. I don’t think they all 
realized that in the beginning. 
So then they start thinking about 
family. If they’re going to get flak 
from their parents: ‘oh you think 
you’re better than us.’ That’s a 
big issue for first-gens.”

LSA senior Ariana Cribbs 

didn’t attribute her challenges 
at the University to being a first-
generation student until her 
junior year when she participated 
in the Sociology Opportunities 
for Undergraduate Leadership. 
With the program, she did 
research on the first-generation 
student experience and during 
her interviews with other first-
generation students, she saw their 
experiences mirrored hers.

“I interviewed other first-gens 

and figured out the challenges 
that I face are not just exclusive 
to me, they’re exclusive to first-
generation 
students,” 
Cribbs 

said. “This is something I was 
experiencing and I didn’t realize 
it was because of my standing of 
being a first-gen.”

 After she moved in her 

freshman year, Zhuo received 
emails about a first-generation 
student dinner and from that 
found 
the 
First 
Generation 

College Students at Michigan 
student group. This year, she 
became the group’s treasurer. 
She said because of finding this 
community, this year has been 
easier for her.

“As a sophomore, since I’ve 

done it once before, and I know 
how the system works now, it’s 
a lot easier,” Zhuo said. “Also, 

knowing people on campus helps 
a lot. Having a community and 
building connections to people 
around me helps navigating the 
whole system.”

Zhao 
affirmed 
that, 
as 
a 

senior, things are much easier 
for him because he has become 
more aware of the different 
opportunities 
available 
to 

him. Cribbs said she still has 
challenges, but the importance of 
her goal of being the first in her 
family to earn a degree keeps her 
persevering.

“It’s still kind of a struggle to 

figure out the new things,” Cribbs 
said. “I didn’t even know going 
toward senior year about applying 
for graduation, and I had to go 
meet up with my advisers. That 
was kind of difficult but I’m just 
super grateful that I’m going to 
actually be a college graduate. 
Once I get my degree and I’m 
making more money, I can go back 
and support my family and my 
community.”

The University and the First 

Generation 
College 
Students 

at 
Michigan 
student 
group 

are working to provide better 
resources 
for 
first-generation 

students. One newly established 
resource is the First-Generation 
Student Gateway, a space for 
first-generation students to seek 
guidance or mingle.

According 
to 
Lang, 
first-

generation student groups are 
popping up in the graduate schools 
as well. Next fall, First-Generation 
College Students at Michigan 
is 
launching 
a 
mentorship 

program 
which 
pairs 
first-

generation upperclassmen with 
first-generation 
underclassmen. 

The upperclassmen can relay 
their 
knowledge 
and 
show 

underclassmen 
what 
a 
first-

generation 
senior 
experience 

looks like.

But there’s still more to be 

done, McCrumb said she wants 
First Generation College Students 
at Michigan to continue to grow 
on campus.

“I 
hope 
that 
the 
group 

on 
campus 
becomes 
more 

prominent,” McCrumb said. “I 
hope the University begins to 
work more with them. That’s a 
group I had to seek out on my 
own. I think giving students that 
information is really important.”

In discussing his goals as the 

president of First Generation 
College Students at Michigan, 
Zhao described wanting to raise 
awareness and debunk narrow-
minded views of first-generation 
students on campus.

“Something 
our 
executive 

board is working on this year 
is demystifying who is a first-
generation 
college 
student,” 

he said. “I think for a long 
time the narrative of a first-
gen student has been a rural 
white student. And we’re really 
hoping to expand that image. 
Within 
each 
racial 
minority, 

they’re disproportionately first-
generation students. We want to 
encourage students to see first-
generation college students as 
intersectional as well.”

After senior year, the journey 

for 
first-generation 
college 

students is not yet over. Cribbs 
applied to graduate schools last 
semester and said she is now 
anticipating 
the 
obstacles 
of 

being a first-generation graduate 
student.

“Knowing what I know now 

about being a first-gen, I’m 
looking forward to when I go to 
grad school and connecting with 
first-gen grad students,” Cribbs 
said.

First-generation seniors have 

four years to adjust and to openly 
discuss 
their 
first-generation 

identity. But Lang thinks it’s best 
to tell people from the start.

“My advice is to be open and 

honest about who you are and 
where you’ve come from your first 
year here,” Lang said. “Be proud 
of who you are. You’re a risk-taker, 
you’re a boundary crosser. That’s 
a real strength that you have. You 
got a lot of guts coming here to 
college. You might as well be open 
about it from the get-go.”

between airports and hotels 
as well as hotel to hotel in 
Las Vegas and San Francisco. 
Through a mobile app, users 
can arrange for a worker to 
pick up their luggage at a 
designated time –– two pieces 
of luggage pieces cost $35, and 
additional items are $10 each.

The company will debut 

at CES to introduce itself to 
the consumer market. Last 
year, 
more 
than 
184,000 

people attended and 4,000 
companies had exhibits –– Eu 
said he would use it to gauge 
consumer interests.

“We see it as an opportunity 

because these people traveled 
there...they bring stuff there 
and they want everything 
to be productive,” Eu said. 
“With 180,000 people coming, 
we are trying to watch out for 
interests of the market share.”

In 
an 
attempt 
to 
gain 

customers from an obvious 
base, 
the 
company 
will 

also offer a 50% off code 
to University of Michigan 
students and alumni for the 
first three months of usage.

Anne Perigo, the Associate 

Director for the Zell Lurie 
Institute at the Ross School 
of 
Business, 
has 
advised 

Eu on his entrepreneurial 
journey since his first year 
at the University. She also 
mentored the development of 
Carrycott, another company 
Eu 
co-founded. 
Carrycott 

offers strollers designed to be 
easily carried with one hand 
and cooling technology to 
prevent children from being 
hot or uncomfortable while in 
the stroller.

In an email to The Daily, 

Perigo 
described 
her 

excitement about Eu’s new 
endeavor.

“Benjamin 
is 
a 
great 

role 
model 
to 
other 

entrepreneurially-minded 
students at Michigan,” Perigo 
wrote. “He is willing to put in 
the hard work necessary to be 
successful and smart enough 
to really listen (to potential 
customers, coaches, advisors, 
judges) to know when to pivot 
or move on to a different idea/
venture. I look forward to 
seeing his success as a serial 
entrepreneur.”

While 
he 
anticipates 

difficulty 
with 
attending 

school 
and 
managing 
his 

company, 
Eu 
remains 

optimistic of his ability to 
balance his time between 
the two because of the way 
he and Yong will manage the 
company.

“I will mainly be managing 

the technological and backend 
side of the operations while 
my co-founder will be in the 
state managing the drivers 
and 
operations,” 
Eu 
said. 

“That’s helpful for us because 
we are able to connect with 
the developers and develop 
the product while staying in 
school.”

LSA 
freshman 
Kate 

Sherwin welcomes the idea of 
the company. While she is not 
a business traveler, she resides 
out-of-state and would find 
the service helpful for moving 
in and out of campus.

“I think that a lot of people 

coming 
off 
airports 
don’t 

really want to deal with a lot 
of luggage,” Sherwin said. 
“Especially for me when I 
was moving into school, my 
family had to carry four or 
five suitcases...especially for 
students, it’s a great product 
and a great company.”

“I think there is a definitely 

a lot of room for improvement 
in helping people learn about 
local government. So I am 
really happy to see the city is 
offering the citizens academy. 
It is difficult to really judge 
the 
application 
process 

that they have until you see 
what the outcome is. I think 
that having some kind of 
application process reflects a 
level of interest,” Morgan said.

Despite concerns regarding 

the 
application, 
Morgan 

emphasized that the Citizens 
Academy is a positive step 
toward 
increasing 
avenues 

for 
civic 
participation 

within Ann Arbor. Morgan 
cited uncontested races for 
City Council and low voter 
turnout as evidence for the 
disengagement among the Ann 
Arbor community.

“I think especially since the 

2016 national election there is 
a heightened awareness of the 
importance of our democracy 
and our civic health. But a lot 
of that heightened attention 

is directed at national level 
issues and to some extent state 
level issues like concerns about 
gerrymandering. I think that 
it starts local and you actually 
have the ability to influence 
outcomes more easily at the 
local level but people often 
tend to discount it. There is a 
lot of things that we can do as 
a community and I am glad to 
see the Citizens Academy, but 
of course I would love to see 
more,” Morgan said.

T

his month a year ago, 
Donald 
Trump 
was 

sworn in as President 

of these United States, and 
many of us were bracing for 
the worst. It seemed too simple 
— 30 seconds with his hand on 
a Bible, rain drizzling down on 
the CNN camera — for such a 
momentous event. I’d spent 
the last three months dreading 
that 
moment, 
reevaluating 

how great a sin it had been for 
President Barack Obama to be 
such a mild liberal. And then, 
all at once, it was over.

I think the biggest surprise 

is how accommodating our 
society and political structure 
have been for someone that 
seems so out of the ordinary. 
Every scandal, for me, has this 
moment where I think, “this 
is it, this is the one that’s just 
too much.” Trump seems to 
weather each media storm with 
ease, though, and so it seems 
that outrage alone isn’t enough 
to actually affect anything.

We know that, if nothing 

else, people opposed to Trump 
only have to wait him out. It’s 
still 
uncertain 
whether 
or 

not we’ll see him after 2020, 
but it’s impossible that we’ll 
see him after 2024. President 
George W. Bush had some 
ridiculous moments, but after 
eight sanitizing years of the 
Obama 
administration 
we 

have largely forgotten these 
moments — and Bush was 
much more destructive than 
Trump has been with regard to 
civilian life.

In spite of all of the energy 

of #resist, we are largely 
resigned to the next three 
years and everything they 
might bring. Just over a third 
of the country is fully on 
board with Trump; the rest 
is waiting with a patience 
that is uniquely, admirably, 
American: remembering that 
Trump is only temporary.

Organizers 
and 
political 

activists know this more than 
anyone else, especially now 
that many are questioning 
whether 
the 
indignant 

backlash of late 2016 and early 
2017 has started to fade. It’s 
nearly impossible to force a 
Republican-led 
government 

to suffer the electoral damage 

that impeachment or another 
drastic action would cause — 
it would alienate a significant 
portion of their base, embolden 
liberals 
and 
would 
hurt 

the 
party’s 
overall 
brand. 

Grassroots alternatives suffer 
from 
their 
own 
problems; 

people don’t actually want to 
march for four years, even if 
they’re angry.

Even 
 
given 
the 
above 

problems, 
I 
don’t 
know 

whether or not waiting until 
the 2018 and 2020 elections is 
an acceptable strategy either. 
On one hand, there are millions 
of people who could be hurt 
by the policies implemented 
during Trump’s presidency. On 
the other hand, Trump is just a 
figurehead. It’s easy to forget 
that the Senate and House of 

Representatives, along with 
the Supreme Court, also have 
a Republican majority when 
the man at the head of the 
party is making so much noise 
about himself.

Our 
situation 
isn’t 
the 

product 
of 
one 
choice 
— 

Hillary 
Clinton 
or 
Trump 

or protest vote — it’s the 
result 
of 
numerous 
other 

small decisions. Low turnout 
for 
state-level 
elections 

means that 67 of 99 of state 
legislatures 
are 
Republican 

controlled. Low turnout in 
midterm elections may have 
influenced 
the 
resulting 

Republican majority in the 
House of Representatives in 
2010 and the Senate in 2014. 
There were chances to take 
back these institutions; there 
were chances to hobble a 
Trump presidency the way 
Republicans 
had 
hobbled 

Obama’s second term.

Liberals didn’t manage it, 

though. 
Midterm 
elections 

don’t get the media attention 
or national scrutiny the way 
presidential 
elections 
do, 

but the legislative balance of 
power depends on them. The 
use of a president, however 
accomplished or charismatic, 
is limited significantly when — 
as with Obama for the majority 
of his years — they have no 
legislative power behind them.

Politics has to be more than 

a “sport for nerds,” and if we 
intend to win we have to focus 
on turnout, not the number of 
nominal partisans in one area 
or another. When trying to stop 
someone accused of sexual 
misconduct, hammering home 
the fact that he’s assaulted 
a number of teenage girls 
and women isn’t going to flip 
his voters (it may, in fact, 
strengthen 
their 
resolve). 

Bringing more of the people 
who already oppose him, or 
who support his opponent, to 
the polls is more effective than 
trying to convert people who 
are already resistant to the 
Democratic party’s ideas.

In one year, the first 2020 

candidates will be declaring 
their candidacy for the position 
of president. In two years, we’ll 
have seen a number of debates, 
and will be coming up on the 
primary 
elections 
(perhaps 

in both parties). Trump, as he 
has this last year, will most 
likely have made an impossible 
number of gaffes and horrible 
statements during this time.

In 
three 
years, 
we’ll 

have 
another 
presidential 

election — and a House of 
Representatives 
election 

that 
will 
determine 

legislative 
redistricting 

after the census. It’s critical, 
especially 
after 
Trump’s 

surprise 
victory, 
that 
we 

remember the many people 
who are already decided on 
progressive ideals, but still 
need to be reminded to vote 
in support of them. Make 
sure, if you’re already weary 
of this president and his 
politics, that you show up to 
cast a ballot.

O

ur campus, like many 
college campuses across 
the nation, has been 

rocked by a number of upsetting 
behaviors 
in 
the 
preceding 

months. Look at any news outlet 
and you will quickly see that 
binge drinking and drug use are 
harming college students both on 
and off campus. Scroll through 
your Facebook feed, and with the 
emergence of campaigns such 
as #MeToo, you will realize that 
some of your most idolized heroes, 
and perhaps even closest friends, 
have suffered sexual harassment 
and assault.

Individuals and administrators 

at the University of Michigan 
should be taking action to do 
whatever they can to limit any 
activity in which students may 
harm themselves or others. This is 
indisputable. What I do not agree 
with, though, is the decision on 
many college campuses, including 
our own, to place disproportionate 
blame on the institution of Greek 
life and its members.

There is a stigma that members 

of Greek life are more likely to 
drink alcohol at levels that may 
endanger themselves and others, 
that 
members 
of 
fraternities 

commit sexual assault at higher 
rates than their non-affiliated 
peers. While these statements 
may be an exaggeration of reality, 
I don’t dispute the truth that is at 
their core. Rather, I dispute that 
these issues stem from Greek life 
and its culture, and the dissolution 
of this institution would result in 
the removal of these problems. 
This piece is not a defense of 
Greek life, but rather a reminder 
that with the end goal of creating 
a safe and educated student 
body, perhaps we are looking for 
solutions in the wrong places.

From my personal experience 

as an active member of Greek life 
on our campus, the demographic 
that typically feeds into Greek life 
is that of a more social and perhaps 
more risk-inclined variety. The 

removal of Greek life would not 
stop students from participating in 
unsafe actions, but rather it would 
simply scatter and disorganize 
these students who are more 
inclined to engage in this type of 
behavior. I contend Greek life is 
highly correlated with, but isn’t 
the sole cause of, the culture and 
behavior universities are trying 
to expel from college campuses. 
Binge drinking and sexual assault 
are important issues that affect 
our entire generation, and they 
are issues an organized Greek life 
system may actually be able to 
help control.

The University doesn’t have 

the authority to enter a student’s 
off-campus, private residence and 
investigate 
behavior 
occurring 

within those walls. The University 
cannot 
monitor 
the 
kind 
of 

alcoholic drinks that might be 
served at a party, nor can it ensure 
support is at the party in case 
something does go wrong. Sure, 
police can be called to a house party, 
and students may be sanctioned 
by the school if they are found 
breaking laws, but this influence 
pales in comparison to the power 
University administrators have 
over Greek life today. The Social 
Responsibility 
Committee 
and 

Greek Activities Review Panel 
are two student-led initiatives at 
the University that work to create 
a 
safer 
campus 
environment 

through their ability to both create 
and enforce restrictions. The 
ban of hard alcohol at fraternity 
houses, the requirement of sober 
individuals to be available to 
help distressed students and the 
member-education requirements 
surrounding 
drinking 
and 

sexual assault are examples of 
policies that could not exist in the 
absence of organized, complying 
organizations 
like 
Greek 
life. 

The system we have today is by 
no means perfect, but at least it 
currently portrays a framework 
for which future programs can be 
instated.

During my time as a member of 

a fraternity here at the University, 
I have been exposed to numerous 
experiences 
that 
helped 
me 

develop the moral compass to 
which I adhere today. Freshman 
year, the new members of my 
fraternity and I participated in 
a 
candid 
conversation 
about 

sex with an on-campus group, 
exposing us to concepts and 
perspectives about consent that I 
had never previously considered. 
Had we not been obligated to 
attend this session by the Office 
of Greek Life, I might not have 
taken the initiative to explore 
these ideas myself. Mandatory 
alcohol education classes, mixed 
with risk-management seminars 
led by older members, taught me 
when to put down my pride and 
pick up the phone to call for help 
if I recognized somebody to be 
in danger. While all freshmen 
are required to attend seminars 
regarding alcohol, drugs and 
sexual activity, the current Greek 
life system has the opportunity to 
require continued education on 
these topics.

Fraternity 
and 
sorority 

members 
should 
accept 

responsibility for any dangerous 
behavior that occurs within 
the walls of their houses or 
committed anywhere by their 
members. 
But 
rather 
than 

pointing 
fingers 
and 
using 

Greek life as a scapegoat to 
prove how the University is 
taking actions to make our 
campus safer, the University 
should partner further with 
the Greek life community. The 
existing systems in place give 
our school the ability to help 
teach its students right from 
wrong, and how they can have 
a good time in a safe, controlled 
environment, something I fear 
they may lose if they maintain 
their current stance.

W

omen won’t save 
the world. Maybe 
a 
woman 
will. 

Maybe the efforts of many 
women will. But when we 
look at “women” as a singular 
entity, we ignore all of the 
many qualified, hardworking 
women who are individuals 
making up this collective. 
We ignore the women who 
have been working to make 
change for years, who are 
people 
with 
stories, 
not 

faceless 
members 
of 
an 

underrepresented group.

It 
has 
become 
harder 

and harder to ignore the 
foundational problems of the 
culture we live in, especially 
in the recent climate. I’ve 
heard 
some 
interesting 

solutions 
posed, 
where 

people have been saying, “We 
should just let the women 
take over.” As in, “We’ve 
royally screwed it up, maybe 
someone else could come 
clean this up.” I’ve seen this 
in response especially to the 
#MeToo 
movement, 
when 

it was revealed that many 
powerful and once-respected 
men wielded their power over 
others to harass, assault and 
silence their victims.

This idea that women are 

the answer, even when shared 
as a joke, is problematic 
because it sheds light on a 
very real mindset. It seems to 
suggest that women are better 
for the job just as a default. 
Not because of qualifications, 
effort 
or 
skill, 
but 
just 

because men apparently can’t 
be trusted in that position. 
It ignores the women who 
have worked hard, who have 
faced discrimination based 
on one or many identities 
and have been systematically 
shut out of positions of power. 
Women deserve to be in 
power not simply as backups 
to men who have shown 
themselves unworthy of the 
power they’ve been given, but 
because they have worked for 
it tirelessly.

Last year, I took an English 

class on medieval women 
with the fantastic Dr. Gina 
Brandolino, 
an 
English 

lecturer at the University of 

Michigan. We talked about 
the ways in which medieval 
literature categorized women 
and put them in one of two 
places: the gutter or the 
pedestal. That is to say, the 
literature would often shame 
women by making them less 
than their male counterparts, 
or it would revere them by 
exalting women and their 
purity. 
Ultimately, 
the 

literature would treat women 
as if they transcended human 
behavior. Women were things 
to be degraded or protected, 
not agents with the ability 
to 
act. 
Revering 
women 

seems better than shaming 
them, maybe, but both serve 
to 
generalize 
women 
and 

ignore the individual, and 
result in the same thing: the 
removal of women from the 
human sphere until they are 
acted upon, not capable of 
action themselves. We only 
studied this categorization 
in medieval texts, but I say it 
happens today as well, in the 
real world.

When we hold women as 

a group applicable to some 
kind of higher, unattainable 
standard, it leaves no room 
for 
natural, 
inevitable 

mistakes. It condemns women 
for human error. It expects 
some kind of salvation to 
come without calling for a 
change in the culture that 
created the problems women 
are somehow expected to fix. 
It’s not the job of women — or 
any victim, from any group — 
to fix a broken system. The 
system has to be changed 
by those individuals most 
ingrained in it by stepping up 
and calling for consequences.

There’s 
also 
a 
problem 

with thinking women are the 
only group being wronged, 
the only silenced people who 
deserve to have a voice. It’s 
not just women who have 
been preyed upon by those 
abusing their power. It’s not 
just women who have been 
shut out of corporate offices, 
writing rooms, center stage. 
What we should be looking 
for is to put the best people 
in positions of power — that 
means people of any identity. 

That means any individual 
who works hard, who proves 
themselves worthy of the 
position, who is willing to 
take a stand against a system 
that they might benefit from, 
even to their own detriment. 
It also means acknowledging 
that it’s far harder for women 
to get there, especially women 
of color, especially women 
in the LGBTQ community, 
especially women with any 
number 
of 
intersecting 

identities who bring their 
own experiences.

And so, women deserve to 

be in power. But not just now, 
not just suddenly after these 
flaws in the system have 
been exposed. For as long as 
there has been a system, as 
long as there have been roles 
with power, there have been 
women who deserved to hold 
them. Not women as a group, 
but individual women, whose 
singular 
accomplishments 

matter. This should not be 
happening because of a hope 
for a magic fix, but because 
eyes are finally opening to 
mistakes that are decades — 
centuries, even — old.

The 
identity 
“women” 

doesn’t signify a cleaning 
crew 
coming 
in 
to 
deal 

with a mess that is years in 
the making. There are real 
solutions to the problems 
we’re seeing; those who abuse 
their power should be called 
out and held accountable so 
everyone knows there are 
consequences for exploiting 
others. There are ways to 
make spaces safe so incoming 
women 
aren’t 
forced 
to 

devote 
half 
their 
minds 

to warding off unwanted 
advances. 
Imagine 
the 

progress that will be made 
when a working woman can 
give all of her brain power 
to the job at hand. Imagine 
the good that will be done 
when a woman’s work can 
be seen for what it is, free of 
prejudice and biases.

Women 
won’t 
save 
the 

world. But letting individual 
women into places they have 
always deserved to be could.

Friday, Janurary 5, 2018 — 5

Every winter break, I try 
to catch up on all the reading, 
writing and music I haven’t 
had time for all semester. 
Inevitably, over the past few 
years, this has extended to 
include catching up on all of 
the films and TV shows — or 
at least episodes — that I’ve 
missed out on. So, I finally 
watched “San Junipero,” the 
Emmy award-winning episode 
of “Black Mirror,” (which, as of 
a few days ago, I am now over a 
year late to) especially because 
it’s still making its way onto all 
of the year-in-review listicles 
about bisexuality in media in 
2017.
In 
this 
episode’s 
world, 
certain 
people 
are 
alloted 
weekly hours in a simulation 
that 
transports 
them 
to 
San Junipero, a paradise on 
Earth where they can live 
in the bodies of their youth, 
chasing 
whatever 
party-
town adventures they desire. 
Yorkie 
(Mackenzie 
Davis, 
“The Martian”) a reserved, 
bespectacled 
young 
woman 
who walks as if constantly 
expecting verbal attack, steps 
cautiously into a club after 
watching Kelly, a charismatic 
and compelling woman, enter 
it. Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, 
“Belle”) slides into Yorkie’s 
booth to enlist her help in 
fending off a guy. They’re 
successful; they dance; their 
chemistry intensifies. Yorkie 
pulls back abruptly, despite 
her obvious attraction — she 
has a fiancé. It’s complicated.
After 
eventually 
getting 
to know each other biblically 
(which both thoroughly enjoy), 
Kelly starts avoiding Yorkie, 
who doggedly looks for her 
week after week. Eventually, 
they decide to stop ignoring 
their attraction and decide to 
meet in real life. This is when 
we find out that Kelly is an 
elderly woman who needs help 
getting up and down stairs, 
and Yorkie has been comatose 
for decades. Both are getting 
ready to “pass over.” Yorkie’s 
fiancé is an amiable man who 
has agreed to marry her solely 
so she can have the afterlife 
she 
desires; 
on 
a 
whim, 

Kelly decides to propose to 
her instead, and the two get 
married in real life before 
Yorkie passes over.
The next time they see each 
other in the simulation, Yorkie 
tries to convince her to stay in 
San Junipero forever. Kelly, 
in an impassioned speech, 
rebukes Yorkie for her naive 
self-centeredness; Kelly had 
family who died the natural 
way, without uploading their 
consciousness. 
Though 
this 
rupture is not insignificant, 

the ending of the episode is 
hopeful — a rarity for “Black 
Mirror.” It hints that Kelly 
chooses to live in San Junipero 
with Yorkie, rather than pass 
over completely.
Staring at the credits roll 
on my screen, I was more 
nonplussed 
than 
anything 
else, at first. Most stories 
like this that I know end the 
opposite 
way: 
The 
person 
who decides that the Great 
Unknown would be the better, 
more noble choice — and gives 
the kind of speech about it 
that Kelly does — generally 
veers in that direction, like 
“Tuck Everlasting.” And often, 
stories that do have a character 
choose a kind of immortality — 
the White Witch in “Narnia,” 
Voldemort in “Harry Potter” 
— live a kind of tarnished, 
sometimes 
cursed, 
life. 
I 
think we’ve been conditioned 
to expect those elements in 
any stories that include some 
degree of immortality.
So it took me some time 
to figure out how I felt 
about “San Junipero.” I had 
originally decided to watch it 

because I had heard so much 
praise for the sensitive and 
touching portrayal of the queer 
storyline. While I think the 
exploration of the trajectory 
of their relationship was, for 
the most part, well-written 
and directed, I don’t think that 
it in and of itself is what sets 
this episode apart as especially 
outstanding.
What I think makes “San 
Junipero” stand out is that 
the subversion of the usual 
choice 
protagonists 
make 
when confronted with any 
kind of immortality becomes 
radical, in this case, precisely 
because of the queer element. 
While Kelly had a happy and 
full life with her husband — a 
relationship that is given the 
space and respect it deserves, 
another rarity in portrayals 
of bisexuality on TV — she 
is allowed another shot at a 
different kind of happiness 
in this simulation; a kind of 
happiness that would have 
been much more difficult to 
pursue while she was growing 
up, being a bisexual woman of 
color.
What makes “San Junipero” 
radical in its ending is the fact 
that the possibility of a happy 
forever for Kelly and Yorkie 
would have been unthinkable 
while they were growing up, 
a reality hinted at throughout 
the episode. The reclamation 
of a happiness that wouldn’t 
have 
been 
conceivable, 
in 
the past, in real life, in real 
time, for this queer couple is 
what earns “San Junipero” 
its ending. A heterosexual 
storyline just wouldn’t have 
felt so feverishly urgent.
Finding spaces like “San 
Junipero” — spaces of at least 
partial escape, happiness to 
be found on unwatched street 
corners, on timeless dance 
floors — is still a radical 
enough 
feeling 
for 
queer 
people. Perhaps that’s why the 
main song in the episode also 
struck a chord with the show’s 
young queer audience (despite 
being slightly before their 
time) for its impractical hope, 
its hint of possibility: “Heaven 
is a Place on Earth.”

Interview: Harry Dolan on 
crime, critcism, comfort

To start off a mysterious crime 
novel by directly identifying the 
sinister killer is a bold move. Yet 
Harry Dolan’s latest book, “The 
Man in the Crooked Hat,” thrives 
on such twists. Smart, subtle and 
subversive, Dolan’s latest lights 
a needed fire under a genre that 
often falls victim to formulaic, 
predictable plots and cardboard-
cutout protagonists. With an 
intricate, 
unpredictable 
plot 
layered over a web of complex 
characters, events and motives, 
“The Man in the Crooked Hat” 
cleverly presents its intricacies 
and manages to keep the reader 
thinking as it burns to a fiery 
conclusion. Recently, The Daily 
had a chance to sit down with 
Mr. Dolan and discuss his newest 
novel, his writing career and his 
meditations on writing itself.
The Michigan Daily: How 
do you avoid falling into the 
same holes that most average 
crime thrillers are plagued 
by?
Harry Dolan: I do a lot of 
plotting of the books in advance. 
I’m thinking very deliberately 
about the plot twists. That’s sort 
of my business. It’s all about 
misdirection, of course, there 
are two things going on in the 
book — what the reader thinks 
is happening and is going to 
happen, and then what’s actually 
happening. You need to be 
thinking about that all the time, 
and that’s what I think about 
when I’m planning these books. 
I focus on trying to make it 
plausible, then create mysteries 
that the reader would not even be 
expecting. In this book, I reveal 
the name of the killer, Michael 
Underhill, right at the onset, so 
what the reader is expecting is 
how the story is going to follow 
the detective Jack Pellum finally 
finding the man who killed his 
wife. So when Pellum goes to 
investigate separate, possibly 
related murders of high school 
students, it turns out that those 
expectations of the reader are 
overturned. 
Obviously, 
the 
tricky part is figuring out how 
to do that. It’s hard to talk about 
this without giving too much 
away [laughs].
Raymond 
Chandler 
talked 
about this because even in 
his time, crime novels were 
becoming formulaic and it was 
hard to surprise the reader. 
His solution was to throw 
in a problem that the reader 

doesn’t even know about, small 
background details or minor 
characters that come to the 
forefront by the end of the book. 
That’s one way to think about 
that.
TMD: What do you think 
makes your book stand out 
from the sea of similar novels 
out there?
HD: First of all, there’s the 
setting. 
Southeast 
Michigan 
serves as the backdrop for the 
story, in and around Detroit and 
small towns like Belleville and 
Chelsea. I spent a lot of time in 
Detroit while I was writing the 
book, especially in the Midtown 
area around the Detroit Institute 
of Arts. I walked around that 
neighborhood, 
I 
sought 
an 
apartment building where my 
protagonist would live, I know 
his address and the places he 
would go and the sights he 
would see.
I think another big thing is the 
way “The Man in the Crooked 
Hat” deals with the killer. You 
know his name from the start, 
and there are a lot of scenes 
written from his perspective. 
All this makes the character 
of the villain richer because, 
in a lot of mystery novels, the 
villain never appears until some 
final confrontation at the end, 
they’re just this shadowy figure 
that acts in the background. 
However, there are a handful of 
scenes with Michael Underhill; 
his parents and childhood are 
detailed, he has a romance with 
this one woman he’s falling in 
love with and building a house so 
they can live together. He’s got 
goals, but he also has a dark past 
he needs to get away from. You 
can even sympathize in some 
cases with him.
TMD: If authors covered 
novels like musicians covered 
songs, what novel would you 
want to cover? Not necessarily 
make it better, but give it your 
own personal spin.
HD: The thing that comes to 
mind first is a book by Donna 
Tartt, “The Secret History,” 
which is about this group of 
college students who commit 
a murder. The whole book is 
about the motivations behind it, 
the psychology of this group of 
characters. I’ve actually thought 
about writing a novel at a college 
like that, this question is not 
entirely hypothetical. I love the 
rest of Donna Tartt’s work, but 
especially that one. It’s the book 
I would want if I was trapped on 
a desert island.
TMD: Do you ever read 

reviews of your books? How 
do you respond to positive and 
negative criticism?
HD: I always tell myself I’m 
not going to read them, but I 
always ended up reading them 
[laughs]. I’m lucky in the sense 
I’ve got mostly positive reviews 
for my books — I still get negative 
ones, definitely. I read them, but 
I try to forget about it soon after. 
I don’t know what good comes 
from worrying about it. You like 
to have good reviews obviously, 
but you can’t let it affect what 
you’re writing. I’m not trying 
to please some reviewer I don’t 
even know, although sometimes 
it’s tempting to try.
TMD: 
Since 
your 
last 
four novels are all similar 
mysterious crime thrillers, do 
you ever feel constrained by 
the limits of the genre? Any 
plans to write outside your 
comfort zone?
HD: I like to read a lot of genre 
fiction, and when I was a kid, I 
was reading a lot of fantasy and 
science fiction. When I was 
younger and thinking about 
becoming a writer, I thought 
that’s what I was going to 
do. I loved [J.R.R.] Tolkien, 
I wanted to write books like 
that. I didn’t have the first 
idea on how anybody got to be 
a writer, though. In college, I 
really got into mystery novels. 
I was studying philosophy but 
reading a lot of crime novels, 
basically everything the college 
library had. I went to Colgate 
University and took a class on 
fiction writing with a novelist 
named Frederick Busch. He was 
very encouraging to me, and he 
was the one who told me to keep 
on writing, outside of the short 
stories I wrote for his class. As 
much as anything, that gave me 
the hope that I could make it as 
a writer; I’m indebted to him. 
Anyways, since then, I haven’t 
really been tempted to write 
anything else, the plan is to keep 
on doing this, albeit with some 
new differences.
The book that I’m writing 
now leans more on thriller than 
mystery, so there’s more action. 
It’s about an ex-soldier, a veteran 
of the Iraq War, who brings 
back with him treasure that’s 
been looted from the National 
Museum in Baghdad. He gets 
in trouble with that and there 
are some very dangerous people 
after him. That’s all I can say 
about that now, but it’s in the 
early stages now and I’m still 
figuring out where it’s going to 
go.

Season four of ‘Black 
Mirror’ is all girl power

The six bingeable episodes 
of 
season 
four 
of 
“Black 
Mirror” are dominated by 
virtual 
reality 
anxieties, 
the 
foreboding 
presence 
of 
increased 
surveillance 
and 
most 
importantly, 
a 
kick-ass 
ensemble 
of 
empowered lady 
protagonists 
who 
lead 
the 
season 
with 
decisive 
clarity 
and 
confidence. 
Often 
cast 
aside as propaganda for the 
technologically weary, “Black 
Mirror” provides insight into 

the human condition while 
addressing 
the 
qualms 
of 
pervasive 
technology. 
The 
show has acted as a sort of 
prophet for current events and 
technological 
advancements, 
ranging from coincidence to 
straight-up creepy. In season 
two, 
showrunner 
Charlie 
Brooker predicted the rise 
of a flippant and 
profane TV star 
in 
“The 
Waldo 
Moment,” a piece 
of fiction that hits 
a little too close to 
home. 
Similarly, 
season three took 
social media celebrity to a 
whole new level in the episode 
“Nosedive,” reminding us of 
the power of a “like.” With 
a skill for honing in on the 

relevant and emphasizing the 
relatable, Brooker creates an 
alternate reality so close to our 
own, it becomes difficult to 
differentiate fact from fiction.
In 
expert 
fashion, 
this 
season takes on such issues as 
helicopter parenting, dating 
apps, toxic masculinity and 
the 
commercialization 
and 
curation of tragedy. Every 
episode tells a new story with 
a new set of characters in a 
new world with new laws of 
nature. The singularity of the 
stories makes every movement 
succinct, yet necessary; every 
conversation 
fleeting, 
yet 
memorable; 
every 
painful 
sequence short, yet powerful.
The first episode of the 
fourth season, “USS Callister,” 
plays like every nerd’s wet

Netflix

dream: the possibility to be the 
hero in your favorite science 
fiction franchise. The appeal 
of this episode is the expert 
character development. Every 
role and persona is crafted 
with the utmost care and 
attention. The episode is led 
by stellar performances from 
FX’s “Fargo” alumni Jesse 
Plemons (“The Post”) and 
Cristin Milioti (“The Mindy 
Project”). 
By 
day, 
Robert 
Daly (Plemons) is the nebbish 
coder at an emerging tech 
company, but by night, he is 
the charismatic and brilliant 
captain of the U.S.S. Callister, 
a spaceship reminiscent of 
“Star Trek”’s very own U.S.S. 
Enterprise. Daly’s fantasy is no 
dream; he is an active part of it 
through virtual reality. He has 
created the characters in his 
crew to resemble those of his 
co-workers. As Daly rules over 

his crew on the U.S.S. Callister 
with an iron fist, he cowers 
behind his screen at the office. 
The episode attacks Internet 
trolls, as well as subtle and 
overt workplace sexism and 
racism. Milioti’s Nanette Cole 
combats 
Daly’s 
misogyny 
with confidence, empowering 
women everywhere to stand 
up and be heard.
“Black Mirror” tapped the 
notable 
actress, 
producer, 
director 
and 
general 
rock 
star Jodie Foster (“Elysium”) 
to direct the ominous and 
pertinent 
“Arkangel.” 
The 
episode 
follows 
a 
nervous 
single 
mother 
(Rosemarie 
Dewitt, “La La Land”) who, 
after a traumatic incident, 
decides 
to 
volunteer 
her 
young daughter to try an 
experimental tracking device. 
The device keeps a tab on the 
child’s 
whereabouts 
while 

providing a creepy feature of 
looking through the child’s 
eyes. The device even blurs 
and 
obscures 
potentially 
harmful, damaging images and 
sounds — working in real-time 
to censor reality. The episode 
provides a biting commentary 
on helicopter parenting and 
presents 
the 
downfalls 
of 
editing reality for one’s child 
in the hopes of protecting 
them from the world.
The real star of this season 
of 
“Black 
Mirror” 
is 
the 
dominant 
and 
unyielding 
female-led 
cast. 
With 
incredible 
performances 
ranging from disturbing and 
nuanced (Andrea Riseborough 
in “Crocodile”) to poignant 
and twisted (Leitia Wright 
in 
“Black 
Museum”), 
the 
ever-changing 
characters 
and transitory narratives are 
worth dwelling on.

‘Ferdinand’ starts off
uneven, ends triamphant 

“Ferdinand” tells the story of 
the titular bull, a pacifist forced 
into a world where he is pressured 
at every turn to give in to the 
violence around him. It is only 
through constant perseverance, 
bravery and faithfulness to his 
moral code that he eventually gets 
his chance at a return to a peaceful 
life.
In other words, “Ferdinand” 
is pretty much “Hacksaw Ridge” 
with adorable animated bulls. And 
it’s actually quite good.
If you’re a cynic like me, the 
quality of Blue Sky Studios’s 

newest outing may come as a shock, 
as the marketing made it appear as 
nothing more or less than a cash-
in on a beloved children’s tale. 
It would check all 
the lowest common 
denominator 
kid’s 
flick boxes: There 
would be at least 
one scene with all 
the main characters 
dancing 
and 
at 
least two montages 
backed by pop music — one upbeat 
song and one slow song — that 
will be dated by the time the Blu 
Ray hits shelves. There would 
also be a plethora of pointless 
animal sidekicks who don’t add 
anything to the plot but do sell 

Happy Meals, plenty of poop and 
fart jokes to keep the kids giggling 
and a talented enough voice cast 
to trick parents into thinking 
there might be 
something under 
the surface.
And yes, there 
is plenty of all 
that, 
montages 
and 
all. 
More 
importantly, 
however, 
there 
actually is something more going 
on. There are plenty of poop 
jokes, but there’s also smart 
physical comedy. There are not 
one, but two trios of pointless 
sidekicks — one of horses, one of 
hedgehogs — but there are also

“Ferdinand”

Quality 16, Rave

20th Century Fox

genuinely funny characters with 
distinct personalities, including 
a 
lab-created 
“Franken-bull” 
who “says nothing and feels 
nothing, including pain.” There 
are dance sequences that come 
out of nowhere and end just as 
pointlessly as they began, but 
there’s also a heart to “Ferdinand” 
that it unabashedly wears on its 
sleeve.
The 
first 
two 
acts 
of 
“Ferdinand” are defined by the 
struggle 
between 
these 
two 
parts of itself: the genuinely good 
animated film it wants to be and 
the shameless cash grab that it’s 
expected to be. The resultant tone 
is uneven as the movie flails wildly 
from poignant to groan-inducing 
on an almost scene-by-scene basis. 
A fantastic conversation between 
two characters discussing their 
insecurities is followed shortly 
by the aforementioned dance-
off. A hedgehog-centric caper 

gives way to a maturely delivered 
revelation with a serious impact 
on Ferdinand (John Cena, “The 
Wall”). A fun chase scene ends 
only for another nearly identical 
chase to immediately begin — 
this one set to a wildly out of 
place Pitbull cover of The Rolling 
Stones’s “I’m Free.”
However, that second chase, 
boring as it is, gives way to the 
third act and climax, which is 
not only hands-down the best 
sequence of the movie, but one of 
the best scenes of any animated 
movie this year. It’s laudably 
thoughtful and restrained, with 
even the rapid-fire dialogue of Kate 
McKinnon’s 
(“Ghostbusters”) 
incorrigible “therapy goat,” Lupe, 
falling silent. In fact, there’s little 
dialogue at all, as director Carlos 
Saldanha (“Rio”) chose to do most 
of the storytelling through visuals 
alone. Like all the best children’s 
movies, “Ferdinand” doesn’t talk 

down to its intended audience 
and instead allows the kids in the 
theater to consider everything 
that’s happened and everything 
that’s at stake. Of all the things I 
was expecting from “Ferdinand,” 
a climax that gave me goosebumps 
wasn’t one of them.
That’s what I got though, and 
that scene and the movie it came 
packaged in was one of the most 
pleasant surprises of the year. 
To be clear, “Ferdinand” isn’t 
perfect. It gives into the lesser 
impulses that have previously led 
Blue Sky to make films like last 
year’s “Ice Age: Collision Course” 
too often for it to be truly great. 
But the heart on display, and the 
way it is usually communicated 
through terrific voice acting and 
a willingness to get real with kids 
about the realities of bullfighting 
makes it worthwhile; a worthy 
adaptation of Munro Leaf’s classic 
book.

Required Listening: 
kicking off the new year

Back in August, the indie rock 
gems in Lemuria put a “secret 
LP” up on their webstore. About 
a week into December, the 
band finally announced that 
the secret release would be a 
brand-new studio album titled 
Recreational 
Hate. 
However, 
don’t let the dismal title fool 
you: The album is full of feel-
good, indie-pop riffs, and it’s 
the perfect way to start out 
2018.
“More Tunnel” reminds us 
that it’s OK to not yet be able 
to see the light at the end of the 
tunnel. “Christine Perfect”’s 
cathartic chorus and pop hooks 
are excellent mood-lifters to 

start the new year during the 
dead of winter. The jangling 
drum beat, tangled guitars and 
muted trumpets on “Wanted 
to Be Yours” mingle perfectly 
with the lighthearted tale of 
falling for a stranger. It’s an 
album full of possibilities and 
new beginnings, all without 
being 
gushingly 
optimistic 
and retaining the humanity of 
failure.
In a year where pop music was 
rather lackluster, its presence in 
other genres fills the gaps left in 
2017. Recreational Hate not only 
fills but also bridges the gaps 
between the realism of rock and 
shimmer of pop. It’s no secret 
that 2017 has been a rough 

year in America, arguably even 
historically, and Lemuria sent 
this shitty year packing with a 
bang, equipping us to take on 
the new year with a refreshingly 
grounded album.
Recreational 
Hate 
stands 
out as a wonderful hybrid of 
indie, rock and pop, attaining 
accessibility without sacrificing 
impressive musical prowess. 
Dropped during the turmoil of 
December, which is saturated 
with end of the year lists and 
emotional closure, the album 
is a pop-soaked sucker punch 
through the gloom to keep us 
moving. Lemuria is a damn good 
band, and their talents have 
never shone quite as brightly as 
on Recreational Hate.

Next to the bubblegum pink 
backdrop of the “Boys” music 
video exists the cutting edge, 
synth-infused dystopia of Pop 
2. Such is the duality of man or, 
more specifically, the duality 
of Charli XCX. To solely know 
her as the mastermind behind 
Stormzy 
seductively 
eating 
cereal or Tom Daley smiling 
like a goddamn movie star 
while soaking wet would be 
to rob her of her true genius: 
She’s a visionary pushing the 
boundaries of pop.
Pop 2 is pop 2.0. Distorted 
echoes 
of 
half-completed 
melodies 
take 
the 
place 
of 
tired 
choruses; 
rough 

experimentation 
takes 
the 
place of polished superficiality. 
Charli XCX’s eclectic mix is a 
welcome reprieve from both 
the monotony of mainstream 
chart-toppers and the hellscape 
2017 became. With Pop 2 you 
could follow Charli XCX down 
the rabbit hole. Cruising in the 
backseat of a neon Porsche, you 
stumble into a glittering fantasy 
of dizzying afterparties and 
pulsing strobe lights.
Pop 2 is a mixtape; a sprawling 
collection of scattered pieces. 
The swaying vocalization of 
“Tears are rollin’ down my 
face, now you gotta go, go, 
go” in “Tears” stands next 
to the pounding destruction 
of 
“Crashed 
your 
daddy’s 
Lamborghini / Charli, baby / 
Pull up, pull up to the party” 
in “I Got It.” The spontaneous 

electronic crash of “Femmebot” 
stands 
next 
to 
smooth 
minimalism of “Porsche.” These 
songs are not cohesive.
Yet, they all seem to exist 
within the same futuristic fever-
dream. Charli XCX’s impossibly 
pitched, 
Autotune-slathered 
voice coats every track with an 
otherworldly saccharine sheen. 
Within the twisted, almost 
extraterrestrial, expanse of Pop 
2, Charli XCX offers up a new 
way to shape the genre.
So the next time you find 
yourself pushing 100 mph down 
a dark highway, allow Pop 2 to 
blast and let Charli XCX turn 
the empty unknown between 
flickering street lights into a 
supernova.

SYFY

‘Happy’ is anything but

Based off of the comic book 
series by New York Times best-
selling author Grant Morrison 
and artist Darick Robertson, 
“Happy!” is anything but. Syfy’s 
newest crime dramedy is far 
from joyful. It’s jam-packed 
with uncomfortable amounts of 
blood, violence, kidnapping and 
badass fist fights. The comedy 
follows the life of alcoholic 
ex-cop turned hitman, Nick Sax 

(Christopher Meloni, “Wet Hot 
American Summer: Ten Years 
Later”), who can see Happy 
— the imaginary friend of a 
little girl named Hailey (Bryce 
Lorenzo, “Orange Is the New 
Black”).
While the plot is rather 
random and curious, the show 
keeps up with it at a good pace. 
There are a lot of moving parts 
that don’t necessarily seem 
to fit. For example, Hailey is 
kidnapped by this empirically 
creepy man dressed as Santa. 
He puts her in a box (so 

scary), and her flying unicorn 
imaginary 
friend 
(Happy) 
escapes and finds Nick. There 
is no context given as to why 
Nick is the only person who can 
see and talk to Happy (which 
actually leads to some pretty 
funny yet concerning moments 
when Nick appears to be talking 
to himself). Happy seems to 
believe Nick is the only person 
that can save Hailey — but why?

Behind Enemy Lines: Illinois 
forward Finke talks Michigan

The Illinois men’s basketball 

team hasn’t made the NCAA 
Tournament since they entered 
as a No. 7 seed in 2013. With a 
new coach in Brad Underwood, 
as well as the loss of one of its 
best players in program history 
in Malcolm Hill, the learning 
curve doesn’t make a hopeful 
tournament bid any easier. 

And after three Big Ten 

games and the entire non-
conference slate, the training 
wheels are definitely still on 
for a growing Fighting Illini 
team. They toppled Missouri 
in St. Louis, and have taken 
Northwestern and Maryland 
into overtime, but to no avail. 
On the other hand, they were 
put away swiftly by lower-
ranked teams such as UNLV 
and New Mexico State.

Illinois (0-3 Big Ten, 10-6 

overall) will enter Crisler Center 
on Saturday off an uninspiring 
— but expected — 77-67 defeat 
at 
the 
hands 

of 
Minnesota 

Wednesday 
night. 
Praise 

and 
blame 

during 
its 

up-and-down 
season 
has 

fallen 
upon 

a 
carousel 

of 
different 

players. One of 
them is redshirt 
junior forward Michael Finke, 
who is averaging 11.1 points 
and 5.7 rebounds per game — a 
dramatic 
improvement 
from 

only a season ago, when he 
posted 6.9 points per game. The 
Daily sat down with Finke at 
Big Ten Media Day in October 
to discuss a changing dynamic 

with a new coach, putting 
Illinois back into conference 
relevancy and more.

The Michigan Daily: Having 

a new coach in the mix, how 
have you seen 
the 
demeanor 

of 
the 
team 

change?

Michael 

Finke: 
The 

intensity 
has 

changed 
a 

bunch. 
Just 

offensively and 
defensively, 
he wants us to 
be much more 
aggressive. Attack on defense, 
(he) really doesn’t want your 
man to catch the ball, trying to 
stop offenses from running their 
normal plays. It sounds easier 
than it really is. Honestly, it’s 
been tough, but we’re grasping 
it well. Offensively, it’s a whole 
different system I’ve never been 
used to. Really spreading the 
floor, moving the ball.

TMD: In the few months 

Coach 
Underwood 
has been here, 
Illinois 
has 

one of the top 
recruiting 
classes 
in 
the 

Big Ten for next 
season. 
What 

has he and the 
team 
done 
to 

start 
bringing 

Illinois back into 

the conference spotlight?

MF: Recruits talk to him and 

they see how good of a guy he 
is, first and foremost. Just how 
tough he wants the players to be 
here, and for our identity to be 
toughness. He wants a tougher 
team. For recruits to see that 
going forward, and to see that 

he’s won everywhere he has 
been is important.

TMD: 
The 
team 
lost 

leading scorer Malcolm Hill 
to graduation, so how do you 

make 
up 
for 

this 
missing 

production?

MF: 

Obviously 
Malcolm 
is 
a 

great 
player. 

Losing a leading 
scorer in Illinois 
history, it’s big. 
But 
honestly 

in the system 
that 
Coach 

Underwood brings to the table, 
there are so many options 
and so many threats. We have 
counters and counters, and 
counters for those. So many 
plays that we have really open 
the floor, get the ball out of 
people’s hands and moving. One 
night, (redshirt junior forward 
Leron Black) might be scoring 
20, the next night Mark Smith 
will.

TMD: Has anyone taken 

it upon themselves to be the 
team’s new on- and off-court 
leader?

MF: A lot of people on our 

team are stepping up. (Leron 
and I) are taking leadership 
roles. The freshmen have come 
in working super hard and 
doing their piece to make this 
team better, too.

TMD: As an upperclassmen, 

what do you expect for yourself 
individually?

MF: I’ve been working really 

hard 
this 
offseason, 
being 

in the gym as much as I can 
looking for an improvement. So 
I think I’ve become more of an 
offensive threat than I’ve been 
in the past, especially in this 
new system.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

“Losing a 

leading scorer 

in Illinois 

history, it’s big.”

“... He wants 

us to be 

much more 
aggressive.”

The redshirt sophomore spoke at Big Ten Media Day 

Livers could be the answer at ‘4’

I

t took Iowa mere seconds 
to expose the weakness 

Michigan’s 
basketball 
team endured 
without 
forward D.J. 
Wilson. 

On the first 

possession 
of Tuesday’s 
matchup, 
Hawkeyes 
forward Tyler 
Cook snapped the ball behind 
his back, took two clean steps 
and threw down a highlight-reel 
dunk.

Left in the dust was fifth-

year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson — simply unable to 
compete with the ballhandler’s 
quickness.

Minutes later, Cook took 

advantage of Robinson yet again. 
Utilizing his six-foot-nine and 
255-pound frame, Cook backed 
him down with little resistance, 
leaving Robinson no choice but 
to foul.

“We all know Duncan 

Robinson is a mismatch ‘4,’ that 
we don’t have another answer 
(for) right now,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “D.J. Wilson 
was the answer (last) year, and 
he’s not here.”

That was apparent Tuesday. 

Robinson finished minus-18 and 
played just four minutes in the 
second half. Cook, meanwhile, 
scored 28 points on 10-for-15 
shooting to lead all scorers — just 
one of the outbursts Michigan 
has surrendered against sizable 
and skilled forwards. 

In November, Luke Maye 

scored 27 points and grabbed 
seven rebounds to lead North 
Carolina to a comfortable win. 
A week later, Ohio State’s Keita 
Bates-Diop and Jae’Sean Tate 
combined for 32 points to key 
the come-from-behind Buckeye 
victory.

Sure, Michigan — despite 

a dramatic turnaround this 
season statistically — isn’t one 
to prioritize defense. Beilein 
primarily thinks about floor 
spacing and shooting. Robinson 

provides that, even when if he 
does create mismatches for the 
Wolverines defense.

But Tuesday, freshman 

forward Isaiah 
Livers showed 
he can provide 
the best of both 
worlds. In 27 
minutes, Livers 
had a career-
high 13 points 
along with two 
rebounds and 
three assists. 
And he was 
equally as 
impressive on the defensive end. 

Midway through the second 

half, Livers thrust his hand into 
the passing lane between point 
guard Jordan Bohannon and 

Cook — his second steal of the 
night.

And in the paint, the 230-

pound Livers held his own, 

posting a 
positive-21 plus/
minus rating.

“Now he’s 

engaged on 
defense,” said 
sophomore 
point guard 
Zavier Simpson. 
“He’s getting 
50-50 balls, he’s 
playing good 
defense, which 

we need out of him.”

Of course, Michigan doesn’t 

mind Livers’ offensive showing. 
Looking more confident than 
ever, he knocked down a trio of 

3s as part of a five-for-six effort 
from the floor.

His shooting stroke was 

even reminiscent of the sharp-
shooter above 
him in the 
rotation.

With the 

Wolverines 
offense stagnant, 
the Hawkeyes 
embarked on a 
7-0 run to cut 
their deficit to 
single digits 
with roughly 
10 minutes to 
play. But on the next possession, 
Livers spotted up from the arc, 
caught a feed from Simpson and 
buried a triple as the shot clock 
expired.

“I think that I could be more 

of a Duncan Robinson,” Livers 
said. “I could shot fake, get the 
defender in the air, and I could 

go right past him 
and get to the 
bucket or make 
open passes for 
my teammates.”

Added Beilein: 

“Isaiah should 
be playing more 
in the future. 
He has been 
working on that 
jump shot and 
his numbers are 

good in practice. He hasn’t done 
it in games, but maybe this a 
breakthrough.”

Plenty of players like Maye 

and Cook line Michigan’s 

remaining schedule. This 
month alone, it will face two 
highly-rated NBA prospects in 
Michigan State’s Jaren Jackson 
Jr. and Purdue’s Isaac Haas. 

Already, opposing frontcourts 

have been instrumental in two 
of the Wolverines’ three losses 
this season.

Tuesday, they came out on 

top — thanks in part to Livers’ 
blending of offense and defense 
while playing for Robinson 
down the stretch.

Now, if Livers can extend that 

beyond Tuesday, the freshman 
could be the forward Beilein has 
been searching for.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Freshman forward Isaiah Livers has shown that he is a very capable defender already. Now, coming off a game against Iowa where he was also a threat offensively, perhaps he is the answer at the ‘4.’

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico became Michigan’s all-time winningest women’s basketball coach on Thursday.

Barnes Arico sets record for wins

Following a road loss to then-

No. 23 Iowa on New Year’s Eve, 
the No. 22 Michigan women’s 
basketball team looked to bounce 
back Thursday night at Wisconsin.

That’s exactly what happened. 

The Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 13-3 
overall) notched an 80-57 victory 
against the Badgers (0-3, 7-9).

Michigan’s 
offense 
started 

hot, finding success in the paint. 
Center Hallie Thome showed 
off quick footwork and scored a 
couple quick baskets to get the 
Wolverines on the board early. 
The junior finished the night with 
20 points.

With Thome and contributions 

from freshman forward Hailey 
Brown, 
Michigan 
outworked 

Wisconsin down low throughout 
the opening quarter. But the 
Badgers didn’t call it quits, tying 
the game at 11 just over six minutes 
in.

The contest would remain tied 

for the next two minutes, as both 
sides failed to execute on offense.

But when freshman guard Deja 

Church came charging down 
the court, things took a turn. 
Church attacked the basket hard 
from the right side and scored a 
quality layup to break the tie and 

provide some energy in what was 
becoming an uneventful game.

Church’s play created a spark 

for Michigan, and senior guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
followed 

up with a three-point play to 
further build the momentum. The 
Wolverines then began pressing. 
This caused a turnover, which 
led to another Michigan bucket 
and an 18-11 lead at the end of the 
quarter.

The second quarter was even-

sided, but the Wolverines faced 
some 
challenges. 
Thome 
got 

called for her second foul early on 
and had to sit out for most of the 
stanza.

To 
make 
matters 
worse, 

Flaherty struggled to get into her 
rhythm offensively and was, at 
one point, 1-for-7 from the field. 
Wisconsin’s zone defense was 
locked on her, and she appeared to 
be a bit rattled. But when Flaherty 
struggled, junior guard Nicole 
Munger stepped up.

Midway through the quarter, 

Munger dove on the floor for a 
loose ball, winning the possession 
back for her team. Munger’s hustle 
— coupled with her 10 points on 
the night — helped Michigan’s 
offense compete when its stars 
were having trouble.

But the Badger’s leading scorer, 

guard Cayla McMorris, then 

settled in on offense. After missing 
the last three contests, she finished 
the night with eight points, and 
her 3-pointer in the second quarter 
helped keep the game somewhat 
close and Michigan’s lead at 31-24 
at halftime.

Though Wisconsin cut into 

the Wolverines’ lead early in the 
third quarter, the second half, 
overall, was more of what you 
would expect when a ranked team 
faces the last team in the Big Ten 
standings.

After 
finally 
finding 
more 

strength on defense and leadership 
from its stars, Michigan started to 
pull away. Flaherty looked more 
like herself, and ended the night 
with 25 points, despite going 
0-for-6 from beyond the arc.

The Wolverines were up 54-42 

heading into the final quarter 
when they really put the pedal to 
the metal, outscoring the Badgers, 
26-15, to secure their victory.

Not only did the victory provide 

Michigan the confidence it lacked 
following its previous loss, but it 
also helped Barnes Arico make 
history. She now holds the record 
for the most wins in program 
history, with 124, passing Sue 
Guevara.

Michigan hires new strength coach

After a regular-season ending 

loss to Ohio State, Jim Harbaugh 
said his team needed to get 
stronger.

At the time, it wasn’t clear 

if he meant that literally. But 
it’s clear now that Harbaugh 
believed in making a change, 
as the Michigan football team 
announced Thursday afternoon 
it has hired Ben Herbert as 
the team’s new strength and 
conditioning coach.

Herbert 
held 
the 
same 

position 
at 
Arkansas 
under 

former coach Bret Bielema for 
the past five seasons. Bielema, 
Herbert and the rest of the staff 
were let go earlier this offseason.

The Wolverines previously 

employed 
Kevin 
Tolbert 
at 

the position. Tolbert worked 
under Harbaugh in stints at 
Stanford and with the NFL’s 
San Francisco 49ers, and was 
with 
Michigan 
throughout 

its preparation for the Jan. 1 
Outback Bowl.

Herbert will come without 

significant ties to Harbaugh, but 
he does have shared history with 
the Big Ten.

Herbert 
was 
a 
defensive 

lineman at Wisconsin, where 
he was a four-year letterman. 
He then spent 11 seasons with 
the Badgers on the strength and 
conditioning staff, eventually 
earning the position of head 
strength coach under Bielema.

In the winter of 2012, Bielema 

left 
for 
Arkansas, 
bringing 

Herbert with him to Fayetteville. 
He explained his philosophy in a 
video produced by the school’s 
athletic 
department 
in 
the 

summer of 2013.

“My 
overall 
philosophy 

encompasses a lot of different 
things,” Herbert said. “I think 
everything 
starts 
from 
a 

development standpoint, with 
how well you take care of your 
body, the types of foods that 
you eat, your meal frequency, 
the types of fluids that you put 
in your body — we place a huge 
emphasis on water.”

Herbert also touched upon 

which areas he places emphasis 
on in the weight room.

“From 
a 
weight 
room 

development 
standpoint, 
the 

most important thing right out 
of the gate for our young guys 
when they come in is developing 
their lower body and developing 
their back,” Herbert said. “A 
lot of guys spend a lot of time 

(bench) pressing in high school. 
They don’t spend a lot of time 
pulling and they don’t spend a 
lot of time training their lower 
body. That’s where we see our 
biggest gains.

“Teach guys how to eat well, 

teach them how to hydrate 
properly, teach them how to train 
the right way, focusing on lower 
body and back development, 
and we set them up for a great 
result.”

One 
of 
Herbert’s 
biggest 

success stories at Arkansas, 
former tight end Hunter Henry, 
tweeted out support of the 
hiring on Dec. 30.

“One of the best hires in the 

country!” 
Henry, 
a 
second-

round NFL Draft pick, wrote. 
“This guy is legit. Might have 
to make a trip up to Ann Arbor 
now.”

According 
to 
Michigan’s 

press 
release, 
Herbert 
is 

a 
certified 
member 
of 
the 

National Strength Conditioning 
Association and the Collegiate 
Strength 
and 
Conditioning 

Coaches Association. He was 
named Master Strength and 
Conditioning Coach in 2015, 
“the profession’s highest honor,” 
and was the youngest coach to 
win the award.

It appears Jim Harbaugh has 

made a significant addition to his 
coaching staff.

According to reports from Sam 

Webb of 247Sports and Brandon 
Justice 
of 
The 
Wolverine 

Lounge, Michigan has hired 
Cincinnati defensive line coach 
Al Washington.

Webb tweeted earlier this 

afternoon 
Washington 
will 

likely serve as a linebackers 
coach, working with the SAMs 
and VIPERs, and has already 
informed Cincinnati signees of 
his departure.

While 
relatively 
young 
— 

he was a three-year starter at 
defensive 
tackle 
for 
Boston 

College 
from 
2002-2005 
— 

Washington has a wealth of 
coaching experience and also has 
ties with defensive coordinator 
Don Brown, whom he previously 
worked under on the Eagles’ 
coaching staff.

After Washington’s playing 

career, 
he 
broke 
into 
the 

coaching ranks right away, with 
stops at Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, North Carolina State 

(as a graduate assistant), Slippery 
Rock and Elon.

Following 2011, which he spent 

as a linebackers coach at Elon, 
Washington returned to his alma 
mater, 
where 

he was a jack-
of-all-trades for 
Boston College. 
In 2012, he was 
the special teams 
coach. Between 
2013-2015, 
he 

was the running 
backs 
coach, 

overlapping with 
the 
tenure 
of 

Brown, who was 
the defensive coordinator and 
linebackers coach at the time.

In 2016, he served as the 

defensive line coach and special 
teams coordinator.

This past season, Washington 

was the Bearcats’ defensive line 
coach under former Ohio State 
interim coach Luke Fickell.

Washington has a pedigree as 

a talented recruiter. At Boston 
College, he signed Jon Hilliman, 
a highly-touted running back 
from New Jersey, and Harold 
Landry, a defensive end currently 
projected as a first-round NFL 

Draft selection. In 2016, Landry 
led the nation with 16.5 sacks and 
earned All-American honors.

In his one year with Cincinnati, 

Washington signed two players — 

including three-
star 
defensive 

end Malik Vann, 
the 
Bearcats’ 

second-highest 
rated recruit in 
their 2018 class.

It’s 
entirely 

possible 
— 

perhaps 
even 

likely — this will 
not be the only 
hire 
Harbaugh 

and 
Michigan 
make 
this 

offseason. According to a report 
from Bruce Feldman of Sports 
Illustrated, offensive tackles and 
tight ends coach Greg Frey is set to 
leave the Wolverines for Florida 
State, his alma mater, while 
the Wolverines have also been 
linked with former Arkansas 
offensive coordinator Dan Enos. 
And thanks to a measure that 
the NCAA approved last spring, 
programs will soon be able to 
hire a 10th on-field assistant 
coach. The new rule will take 
effect Jan. 9.

Michigan to face dominant No. 2 Notre Dame in home-and-home series

Tuesday 
afternoon, 
the 

Michigan hockey team captured 
a come-from-behind, 6-4 victory 
against Michigan State to claim 
third 
place 
for 
the 
second 

straight year in the Great Lakes 
Invitational.

Three 
days 
later, 
the 

Wolverines (3-5-2-1 Big Ten, 
8-8-2 overall) will need to 
carry this momentum on short 
rest as they face their toughest 
opponent yet: No. 2 Notre Dame.

In its first conference matchup 

of 2018, Michigan will square off 
against the powerhouse Fighting 
Irish (10-0-0-0, 16-3-1) in the 
first of two home-and-home 
series this season — this Friday 
in Ann Arbor and Sunday in 
South Bend.

With Notre Dame joining the 

Big Ten this season, the two 
programs renew their annual 
rivalry. It officially started in 1921 
and spanned from 1971-1981 and 
1992-2012, when the Fighting 
Irish were part of the WCHA 
and CCHA, respectively — two 
conferences in which many Big 
Ten teams also competed.

With 
a 
quick 
turnaround 

following the GLI, the Wolverines 
have had limited practice time, 
taking a mandatory day off 
Wednesday and participating in 
a short skate Thursday.

“It’s a weird week,” said 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
Tuesday. “You’d like to have a 
normal week to practice and 
prepare, especially for a team 
like Notre Dame, but maybe 
that’s okay. Maybe it’s okay we 
played a couple of games and we 
had to battle.”

Notre Dame, on the other 

hand, is well-rested, idle since 
dominating Wisconsin, 6-2, on 
Dec. 9.

Unstoppable 
of 
late, 
the 

Fighting Irish have won 13 
straight 
games, 
the 
longest 

active winning streak in the 
country 
and 
school 
history 

while competing in a NCAA 
Division I conference. They are 
the first Big Ten team to win its 
first 10 conference games in a 
season.

Notre 
Dame 
is 
also 
the 

nation’s only team without a road 
loss, and its 8-0-0 record is tied 
for the most wins in the NCAA 
on unfamiliar ice.

During 
the 
current 
win 

streak, sophomore goaltender 

Cale Morris started each game, 
posting a .960 save percentage, 
1.38 goals-against average and 
four shutouts.

Sophomore 
forward 
Cal 

Burke leads a balanced offensive 
attack with a team-high 12 goals, 
including seven over the last 
five games. Senior forward Jake 
Evans boasts 28 points — seven 
goals and 21 assists — through 20 
games.

The Wolverines have a hot 

hand of their own in forward 
Cooper 
Marody. 
The 
junior 

is 
coming 
off 
a 
five-point 

performance at the Great Lakes 
Invitational, 
including 
his 

second career hat-trick against 
Michigan State, earning him Big 
Ten First Star of the Week.

However, 
Michigan 
will 

continue to play without three 
of its best players. Sophomore 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood, 

freshman forward Josh Norris 
and 
freshman 
defenseman 

Quinn Hughes were selected 
to the United States National 
Team for the World Junior 
Championships in Buffalo, N.Y., 
taking them off the Wolverines’ 
roster from Dec. 26 to Jan. 5.

Despite the wear and tear 

from 
the 
hard-fought 
GLI 

games, lack of preparation time 
and shortage of star playmakers, 
Pearson is still confident his 
team will be ready for the Big 
Ten’s best.

“They haven’t played in a 

while, so we have to be ready 
to go and I think we will be,” 
Pearson said. “We have to get 
after them. I’m really looking 
forward to it, the opportunity for 
our team to play Notre Dame at 

Yost Ice Arena.

“It elevated the whole Big Ten 

by adding Notre Dame. They’ve 
been really good, and good 
for them, but we’ll show up on 
Friday.”
