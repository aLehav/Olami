ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

UMich hires executive 

search firm to aid 

presidential search, asks 

for community input

‘‘U’ employs Isaacson, Miller to assist in examining 

candidates, making recommendations 

It’s official: the University of 

Michigan is searching for its new 
president. 

University 
regents 
Sarah 

Hubbard (R) and Denise Ilitch (D), 
co-chairs of the Presidential Search 
Committee, shared in an email to 
the campus community Tuesday 
afternoon that the new Presidential 
Search Committee will meet for the 
first time later this week. 

The committee will consist of 

the eight regents and members of 
the campus community including 
students, faculty and alumni from all 
three U-M campuses and Michigan 
Medicine. Throughout February, 
the regents will solicit feedback 
from community members through 
virtual learning sessions and an 
online survey for people unable to 
attend.

“The leader of the nation’s top 

public research university is one of 
the most prominent and influential 
positions in all of higher education,” 

Hubbard and Ilitch wrote. “The 
committee’s work will rely on the 
university community’s insight into 
the challenges and opportunities 
that may face our university and 
its new president in the coming 
decade, as well as the personal 
characteristics 
and 
experiences 

needed to lead the university at this 
moment in time.”

Hubbard 
and 
Ilitch 
said 
the 

Presidential Search Committee will 
be working closely with the regents 
and an executive search firm to make 
recommendations and review candidates 
before the full Board of Regents elects the 
next University president. 

“To protect candidate privacy 

and encourage the greatest number 
of well-qualified candidates to apply, 
the committee will keep candidate 
names confidential,” Hubbard and 
Ilitch wrote.

To assist with recruiting and 

examining candidates, the regents 
have hired John Isaacson and John 
Muckle from the executive search 
firm Isaacson, Miller. Hubbard 
and Ilitch wrote that the firm 
specializes in recruiting leaders for 
organizations and conducts more 
than 350 senior-level executive 

searches each year. Over the past 38 
years, the firm has conducted more 
than 7,300 searches, according to 
Hubbard and Ilitch. 

Forty-five percent of the firm’s 

searches resulted in hiring women 
and 25% resulted in hiring people of 
color, Hubbard and Ilitch added.

In a statement to The Michigan 

Daily, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald shared that the Board 
of Regents hopes to have the next 
University President elected by this 
summer.

“The Board of Regents and the 

Presidential Search Committee are 
looking at both internal and external 
candidates to identify candidates 
best suited to lead the University of 
Michigan at this moment in time,” 
Fitzgerald wrote.

Additionally, 
Fitzgerald 
said 

Interim University President Mary 
Sue Coleman’s contract is still 
being finalized and that Coleman 
has agreed to serve until the new 
president takes office.

Members 
of 
the 
committee 

include 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization 
President 
Kirsten 

Herold, Colleen Conway, former 
chair 
of 
the 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
and other faculty and students 
from across all three University 
campuses. 

The search for a new president 

comes after the Board of Regents 
fired former University President 
Mark Schlissel on Jan. 15 for 
engaging 
in 
an 
inappropriate 

relationship with a subordinate. 
Though Schlissel will no longer 
serve as University President, he 
was offered a contract to return to 

campus this fall as a professor in 
the microbiology and molecular, 
cellular, and developmental biology 
departments. 

Nominations and applications 

for the University President may be 
submitted directly to the firm and 
will remain confidential.

University of Michigan Provost 

Susan Collins has been named the 
next president and CEO of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston, according to 
a press release Wednesday from the 
University Record. She is expected to 
begin on July 1, 2022.

“It is an honor and an inspiration 

to serve as the Boston Fed’s next 
president,” Collins said in the release. 
“Throughout my career, I have been 
driven by a commitment to leveraging 
research, education and public service 
to improve lives.”

The role of the provost includes 

oversight over the University’s 19 
schools and colleges in Ann Arbor. 
Additionally, the provost also serves 
as chief academic officer and chief 
budget officer. 

Collins was appointed as University 

Provost in January 2020 and planned 
to step down this June. With her new 
appointment, she now will leave this 
role on May 15. Collins initially replaced 
former Provost Martin Philbert after 
he was placed on administrative 
leave following multiple allegations 
of sexual misconduct. Collins also 
previously held the position of Dean 
of the Ford School of Public Policy 
and was also an economics and public 
policy professor. 

Interim 
University 
President 

Mary Sue Coleman also announced 
in the University Record press 
release that she will now end 
provost search efforts started last 
fall and appoint an interim provost, 
according to the press release. 
Coleman shared that this decision 
was in collaboration with the Board 
of Regents.

Diversity in fashion: NOIR, SHEI host runway at UMMA

Sartorial elegance on full display as magazines showcase locally designed attire

As 
New 
York 
Fashion 

Week geared up in the heart 
of Manhattan, the University 
of Michigan Museum of Art 
(UMMA) 
hosted 
a 
sartorial 

revue of its own Friday night. 
In 
collaboration 
with 
SHEI 

Magazine — a student-run fashion 
and pop culture magazine, NOiR 
Runway Fashion — a fashion 
organization dedicated to diversity 
and community service — and 
Runway of Dreams, the UMMA 
debuted its series of “Feel Good 
Friday” events with a fashion 
show and clothing swap on Friday 
night. 

Dubbed “Feel Good Fashion,” 

the night kicked off with a social 
hour 
where 
attendees 
could 

mingle, take photos and sit by 
the red carpet. Upstairs, NOiR 
models were scattered throughout 
the gallery, standing stoically 
alongside the exhibits’ various 
paintings and sculptures for 
guests to view. 

A 
red 
carpet 
featured 

prominently 
accentuated 
by 

dancing pink and blue lights, as DJs 
from Maize Collective, a student-
run art and music community, 
queued music. Standing opposite 
the red carpet were several racks 
of clothing where guests could 
drop off unwanted clothes and 
“refresh (their) style” by swapping 
old garments for new ones.

LSA senior Krista Albertins, 

UMMA programs assistant and 
co-leader of the UMMA Student 
Engagement Council, said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily the museum wanted to bring 
fashion to the campus community. 

“We were trying to think of 

what would be something that we 
could do that is interactive with 
(regard to) clothing,” Albertins 
said. “(We) decided to do a 
clothing swap where people can 
bring clothes and take clothes 
with them, and feel like they’re 
participating in fashion as well.”

After the social hour, the 

Runway of Dreams Foundation 
held a runway show featuring 
models 
from 
nonprofit 

organization Best Buddies and the 
Michigan Special Olympics Figure 
Skating Team. Runway of Dreams 
aims to empower people with 
disabilities and support accessible 

and adaptive fashion for all.

LSA senior Tori Weingarten is 

on the executive board of Runway 
of Dreams, which holds “adaptive 
runway 
shows” 
worldwide, 

including a show at the University 
of Michigan every year.

“We have our annual fashion 

show that supports adaptive 
fashion for kids with disabilities,” 
Weingarten said. “It’s awesome to 
see all seven of our models rocking 
(this) Zappos clothing , and it’s just 
such a special event.”

To close the night, SHEI 

Magazine and NOiR held a joint 
runway show, sending dozens 
of models down the red carpet, 
decked out in attire from local and 
student designers. In addition to 
the Feel Good Fashion show, NOiR 
holds an annual Spring Fashion 
Show and chooses one charitable 
cause to support. This year’s 
show will take place on March 19 
at the Michigan Union, and will 
raise funds for Freedom House 
Detroit, an organization providing 
temporary housing and resources 
to people fleeing persecution and 
seeking asylum.

Business junior Jalen Gu, 

vice president of NOiR, said 
the purpose of the event was to 

promote philanthropic fashion 
and celebrate unity. 

“We’re 
about 
supporting 

charitable causes and doing all 
these other great things that 
have to do with (what) art has 
to do with,” Gu said. “So I think 
that’s one thing, this isn’t just 
fashion, this isn’t just a runway, 
it’s a celebration of all these other 
things.”

LSA senior Nadia Bailey, model 

coordinator 
for 
the 
UMMA 

runway show, said she strove for 
a diverse set of models. She said 
the theme of the show, “You Are 
Here,” was meant to celebrate 
socialization 
following 
the 

pandemic. Bailey ensured models’ 
posing and style on the catwalk 
reflected the theme.

“I made it a priority to make 

sure that I chose a diverse range 
of models of all different shapes, 
sizes and ethnic backgrounds,” 
Bailey said. “And then I also have 
to come up with the scenes that 
they’re going to be placed in, the 
songs of the scenes, and also teach 
the models how to walk up and 
down the runway as.

The Washtenaw County Health 

Department 
announced 
Friday 

morning COVID-19 health orders — related 
to indoor masking as well as isolation and 
quarantine guidelines — for K-12 schools 
will be lifted effective Feb. 28. 

Masking 
will 
remain 
strongly 

recommended in schools after the orders 
are lifted and will be required on public 
transportation, including school buses, 
under federal orders. Students who 
test positive or are in close contact with 
someone who tests positive after Feb. 
28 must not attend school under the 
Michigan Public Health Code and existing 
administrative rules. 

Jimena Loveluck, WCHD health officer, 

said in a press release the masking and 
quarantine and isolation health orders were 
implemented at the height of the pandemic 
to help maintain in-person learning, but 
said current conditions warrant more 
flexibility in the COVID-19 policies.

“Local health orders have been necessary 

during the pandemic, and these orders have 
helped protect in-person learning, critical 
health care capacity, and overall health,” 
Loveluck said. “We are in a different place 
now. We can offer more flexibility while we 
continue to provide appropriate guidance 
and work with our local schools to protect 
health, prevent spread, and maintain 
in-person learning as safely as possible.”

Washtenaw County is one of nine 

counties in the state of Michigan to lessen 
COVID-19 mandates for public schools, 
according to The Detroit Free Press. 
Oakland County announced Friday they 
would lift their mask mandate for public 
schools on Feb. 18 and Ingham County 
announced Thursday their emergency 
health order will cease on Feb. 19.

Whitmer removes sales tax on all feminine hygiene products in the state
 ‘Tampon tax’ officially ends

The State of Michigan’s 6% 

sales tax on tampons and other 
menstrual 
goods 
officially 

ended Thursday. A bipartisan 
bill removing the tax, which 
is applied to “luxury goods,” 
went into effect 90 days after 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer, 
D-Mich., signed it into law. The 
bill is applicable to tampons, 
panty liners, menstrual cups, 
sanitary napkins and other 
products connected with the 
menstrual cycle.

This bill comes after other 

states 
including 
California, 

New York and Connecticut 

passed bills eliminating the 
tax on menstrual products. 
Currently, 27 states continue 
to levy a sales tax on feminine 
hygiene products. 

The average menstruating 

Michigander uses about 17,000 
pads or tampons, which can 
add up to $4,800 in just sales 
tax, according to Whitmer’s 
press release. 

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Whitmer said 
this bill has been in the works 
for 10 years.

“I’m thrilled because we 

know that the purchase of 
these essential items is not 
discretionary,” Whitmer said. 
“It’s 
an 
absolute 
essential 

need, and when we tax it, 

we 
disproportionately 
hurt 

women and girls in Michigan, 
and that’s why it’s so important 
that we eliminate this tax: so 
anyone who menstruates in 
the state of Michigan now will 
not have to pay this additional 
burden.”

Period Equity, a nonprofit 

founded by women, has led 
a nationwide movement in 
repealing the “tampon tax.” 
In 2016, the organization filed 
a lawsuit against the State of 
Michigan, alleging the state’s 
tax 
was 
unconstitutional 

because it discriminated on 
the basis of sex.

This bill is part of a greater 

effort 
to 
make 
menstrual 

products 
more 
accessible. 

In 
November, 
Ann 
Arbor 

became the first city in the 
country to require free sanitary 
products in public restrooms for 
menstruating individuals.

Whitmer said this bill will 

improve the quality of life for 
menstruating individuals across 
the state.

“People 
spend 
thousands 

of 
dollars 
(on 
menstrual 

products) over the course of a 
lifetime,” Whitmer said. “This 
is a meaningful improvement 
in terms of the bottom line for 
people like my daughters and 
me, all of us who menstruate.”

GOVERNMENT

Governor Gretchen Whitmer 

(D) presented a $74.1 billion 
election-year 
budget 
plan 

Wednesday to support Michigan 
and “invest in the success of our 
future”

In the bill, Whitmer suggested 

one-time 
funding 
increases 

of 5% for all public Michigan 
universities 
and 
community 

colleges, 
totaling 
to 
$76.3 

million. The bill also includes 
a 5% ongoing funding increase, 
which is another $76.3 million of 
continued funding for operations. 
This money, plus $200 million 
more, will be used for everyday 
campus use such as technology, 
infrastructure, maintenance and 
equipment. 

For other community colleges 

in Michigan, the budget will 
award a $16.2 million one-
time increase and $16.2 million 
ongoing 
funding. 
This 
is 
a 

significant increase from the 
stagnant budget that has not 
changed in the past few years. 

The plan will also provide $1 

billion for K-12 funding. This 
funding will be used for the 
creation of infrastructure and 
modernization of buildings. Each 
district will be awarded $170 
million annually for other future 
projects. 

“It 
would 
make 
game-

changing investments in every 
student, in every district, fund 
school construction and mental 

health at a historic scale, and 

retain hundreds of thousands of 
school staff,” Whitmer said in 
a press release obtained by the 
Michigan Daily. “The budget 
makes schools safer, helps every 

student be a better student, helps 
every teacher be a great teacher, 
and helps our kids be kids.”

Whitmer also said she is 

putting an emphasis on mental 
health with this bill and plans to 
support teachers more financially 
by providing bonuses of $11,000 
for school employees who stay in 
their jobs through 2025. 

In 
addition 
to 
students, 

Whitmer’s budget is set-up 
to offer tax relief for senior 
citizens and low-wage workers. 
According to her plan, the 
government would start with a 
25% tax reduction for citizens 
65 years of age and higher. 
As time goes on, she hopes to 
increase the reductions and 
decrease the age requirement, 
overall saving taxpayers about 
$1,000 a year. 

Whitmer 
has 
set 
aside 

$88 
million 
towards 
the 

Unemployment 
Insurance 

System, following suggestions 
from her predecessor, Governor 
Rick Snyder (R).

According 
to 
her 
press 

release, 
Whitmer’s 
budget 

recommendation 
“puts 

Michiganders first and delivers 
on the issues that matter most to 
Michigan families.”

Whitmer’s 
entire 
budget 

is a 10.4% increase from her 
previously-proposed plan early 
last year. According to the U.S. 
News, the extra money has come 
from federal payments to state 
governments 
in 
response 
to 

COVID-19, and high tax revenue. 

The extra money will go to a 

variety of different funds, from 
dental services to psychiatric 
facilities to water quality.

Ann Arbor City Council met 

Tuesday 
night 
to 
approve 
an 

amendment to a resolution proposing 
changes to East Medical Center 
Drive Bridge near the University of 
Michigan Medical Center. 

The council previously approved 

a resolution in October 2021 to 
establish a services agreement with 
DLZ Michigan, an architectural and 
engineering consulting firm, to widen 
the bridge, a four-lane road over the 
Amtrak Michigan line and the main 
route to the University of Michigan 
Medical Center. 

University officials have previously 

told City Council they are interested 
in adding another lane for automobile 
traffic, which would reduce the west 
sidewalk from 10 1/2 feet to eight feet 
wide. According to Michael Rein, the 
University’s director of community 
relations, the reduction in width of 
the west sidewalk was designed to 
promote safer bicycle traffic.

“That reduction from 10 1/2 to eight 

feet was by design to promote traffic 
on the east side — safer bicycle traffic, 
safer non-motorized traffic,” Rein said.

Rackham 
student 
Bethany 

Beekly told the council during public 
commentary 
that 
the 
proposed 

design would make the bridge more 
dangerous for bicycle and pedestrian 
traffic, as well as threaten Ann Arbor’s 
goals to decrease carbon emissions 
and cut vehicle miles traveled in half. 

“As it currently stands … the bridge 

widening proposal is inadequate on 
pedestrian and cyclist safety and also 
counterproductive for our climate 
goals,” Beekly said. “Trying to solve 
congestion issues by increasing car 
capacity is a strategy that we’ve known 
for decades to be counterproductive.”

Councilmember 
Erica 
Briggs, 

D-Ward 5, proposed an amendment 
asking the council to encourage the 
city administrator to proceed with 

efforts to rehabilitate the bridge 
without widening it if an agreement 
cannot be made with the University 
to expand sidewalks on either side of 
the road. 

Briggs expressed that if this 

amendment 
was 
not 
passed, 

she would be in favor of simply 
rehabilitating the bridge rather than 
widening it. 

“It’s important to note that the 

city’s plans do not call for widening 
this bridge,” Briggs said. “Our 
(Capital Improvement Plan) called 
for rehabilitation. City staff has 
expressed no concerns with simply 
rehabilitating the bridge and not 
widening. The desire to widen this 
infrastructure has come from the 
University of Michigan.”

Councilmember Jen Eyer, D-Ward 4, 

expressed her support for the amendment, 
emphasizing the safety concerns. 

“A vote against this amendment 

is a vote to make this situation more 
dangerous,” Eyer said. 

Ultimately, 
Briggs’ 
proposed 

amendment 
failed 
5-6 
with 

councilmembers Eyer, Briggs, Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, Linh Song, 
D-Ward 2, and Julie Grand, D-Ward 
3, voting in favor. 

Briggs noted that the proposed 

changes would make the sidewalk 
on the west side narrower, noting the 
dangers this would cause to cyclists 
and pedestrians.

“There are more cyclists on the 

western side of that intersection 
than on the eastern side, and that’s 
for a reason,” Briggs said. “(Cyclists 
are) trying to avoid the dangerous 
conditions that are along Fuller and 
Glen and regardless of what the 
University suggests, people are taking 
West Medical Center Drive because 
it’s safer. They could reroute in the 
future … we could ask that of them. Or 
we could ask the University to pay to 
do this project properly.”

Kathy 

Griswold, D-Ward 2, spoke to The 
Michigan Daily about her spending 
priorities. 

“I really want to focus on the people 

who have been the most impacted by 
the pandemic, and that would be the 
marginalized community as well as 
essential workers,” Griswold said.

Griswold said new programs 

to help the homeless would help 
ameliorate the impacts of the 
pandemic.

“We forget that in Ann Arbor, 

which is a very wealthy community, 
we have people sleeping in their cars, 
and that is not acceptable and we need 
to address that,” Griswold said. “So 
that would be my first priority.”

The City Council has also been 

taking 
public 
suggestions 
into 

consideration for reallocating the 
ARPA funding.

“Staff came up with an initial list 

based on what was already in the 
council pipeline,” Griswold said. 
“But as one constituent said, those 
seem like pet projects rather than 
ways to help people recover from the 
pandemic.”

Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, 

D-Ward 1, said in an email to The 
Daily he is concerned that the process 
was not considering enough input 
from the community

“I feel that the process has been 

very internal-facing and has not 
taken into account many good ideas 
presented from the public,” Hayner 
wrote.

He said the original deadline 

for project ideas, which was set for 

early Dec. 2021, allowed the City 
Council to avoid hearing public 
input. According to Hayner, he 
introduced Resolution R-21-396 to 
push the deadline for project ideas 
back to March 2022 to incorporate 
more voices from the Ann Arbor 
community.

Since presenting their research in Janu-

ary 2021, Michigan Law professor Michael 
Steinberg and Taubman professor Robert 
Goodspeed have been working to remove 
racially restrictive covenants — policies 
which bar people of color from owning cer-
tain homes — from Washtenaw County title 
deeds.

Steinberg and Goodspeed are cur-

rently developing maps that lay out the 
racially restrictive covenants in Washt-
enaw County, pursuing legal action to 
repeal these covenants and expand-
ing their program to discover places 
of potential de facto discrimination — 
which may not be explicitly written in 

law, but happens in practice — in Washt-
enaw County.

As of Jan. 28, Steinberg and Good-

speed have identified 66 subdivisions in 
Ann Arbor that contain discriminatory 
language against people of color within 
their title deeds. In 1948, the racially 
restrictive covenants were banned 
from being enforced, but Steinberg and 
Goodspeed say the continued existence 
of these covenants illustrate the preva-
lence of institutionalized racism. 

In their study, Steinberg and Good-

speed concluded that the presence of 
these covenants can make PoC home-
owners feel unwelcome in their own 
community and exist as a reminder of 
institutional racism that still persists 
today.

Ann Arbor resident Jeffrey Hamilton 

said he felt disappointed by the racially 
restrictive covenants, despite saying 
how Ann Arbor is considered a more 
progressive city.

“I feel honestly offended and very, 

very let down, but not surprised,” Ham-
ilton said. “The funny thing is, being 
in Ann Arbor, we were often given the 
idea that Ann Arbor is a cut above when 
it comes to these types of covenants … 
When you look at Ann Arbor, as pro-
gressive as it is, it kind of sets you back.”

Hamilton also added that by continu-

ing to have these racially restrictive cov-
enants in place, the city is still upholding 
institutionalized racism.

“This shows me that there’s still some 

The 
College 
Board 

announced major changes to 
the SAT on Jan. 25, including a 
move to a digital format as well 
as changes to the general struc-
ture of the test — a move that 
has reignited debates over the 
future standardized testing in 
college admissions. 

LSA sophomore Alex Nguy-

en, LSA representative for 
Central Student Government, 
said he acknowledged that he 
had advantages when taking 
standardized tests due to his 
economic background that dis-
advantaged groups might not 
be able to afford.

“I’m lucky to be able to go to 

these ACT/SAT prep courses,” 
Nguyen said. “I (took the SAT) 
twice and I could go back and 
retake it as many times as I 
want(ed) …. It would cost hun-
dreds of hundreds of dollars. 
But I was able to do that.” 

The SAT currently offers fee 

waivers for 11th and 12th grade 
students of low-income back-
grounds in the U.S. In 2019, 
the SAT also began offering 
“adversity scores” in order to 
acknowledge a student’s over-
all disadvantage level to help 
college admission officers con-
textualize candidates’ socio-
economic circumstances. 

Additionally, 
the 
College 

Board has changed the read-
ing and math sections, and the 
overall test will be shortened. 
Previously, the test took about 
three hours to complete and the 
new updates will set two hours 
for the test with more time allo-
cated per question. As a result 
of these changes, the scores are 
expected to be released in days 
instead of weeks or months.

Priscilla 
Rodriguez, 
vice 

president of College Readiness 
Assessments at the College 
Board, wrote in a press release 
these changes are designed to 
make the overall testing expe-
rience better for all students 
in today’s changing college 
admissions times. 

“The digital SAT will be 

easier to take, easier to give, 
and more relevant,” Rodriguez 
wrote in the release. 

Rodriguez 
wrote 
in 
the 

release that the updates result-
ed from recent educational 
trends and developments. 

“We’re not simply putting 

the current SAT on a digital 
platform — we’re taking full 
advantage of what delivering 
an assessment digitally makes 
possible,” 
Rodriguez 
wrote. 

“With input from educators 
and students, we are adapting 
to ensure we continue to meet 
their evolving needs.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

spokeswoman Kim Broekhui-
zen told The Michigan Daily in 
an email that the University is 

still unaware of what impact 
this could have on their admis-
sions process. 

“We are aware of the recent 

announcement from the Col-
lege Board. The new SAT test 
will not be available until 2023 
for international students, and 
2024 for domestic students,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “We will 
use this time to learn more 
about the proposed changes 
and 
timeline 

from the Col-
lege Board 
to 
deter-

mine 
what, 
if 
any 

impact, it 
will have 
on 
our 

process.”

FairTest, 

an 
organi-

zation lead-
ing 
the 

U.S. test 
optional 
move-
ment, 
found 

1,815 colleges and univer-
sities currently either prac-
tice test-optional or test-blind 
admissions, a 70% increase 
from the only 1,070 institutions 
that did so before the pandemic. 

Broekhuizen wrote the Uni-

versity has been flexible for 
the past two admission cycles 
due to the pandemic, and that 
ultimately, the University is 

still committed to a more com-
prehensive approach despite 
changes 
with 
standardized 

testing requirements. 

“The University of Michigan 

is committed to holistic appli-
cation review and testing is 
just one of many factors in our 
process,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“Holistic review includes con-
sideration of a student’s record 
including 
courses, 
grades 

and 
grade 
trend, 

essays, extra-

curricular 

activities, 
recommen-
dation let-

ters, and 
stan-
dard-
ized test 
scores, if 

provided.”

As one of 
the 
top 

institu-
tions 
in 
the 

country, 

Nguyen said, the Uni-

versity should lead the 

path away from standardized 
testing like other top colleges. 

“I believe we really are the 

leaders, in which we need to 
start going in that direction of 
some of the best schools in the 
nation,” Nguyen said. 

Nguyen said the College 

Board and other standardized 
testing organizations are busi-

nesses who profit off wealthy 
families trying to get their stu-
dents into good schools. 

“I mean, it is a business, Col-

lege Board and the ACT, ” Nguy-
en said. “And I think Michigan 
just kind of plays into it.”

LSA freshman Alan Zhang 

said the SAT is something all 
students have in common when 
applying to college. 

“I 
think 
it’s 
extremely 

(important) to have just a 
benchmark 
of 
comparison,” 

Zhang said. “People come from 
widely different backgrounds 
and the SAT is the one factor 
that will be common.” 

Zhang said the SAT could be 

used to compare and differentiate 
two people from similar socio-
economic backgrounds by using 
their standardized test scores.

“Let’s say you have two differ-

ent individuals from disadvan-
taged backgrounds. But one of 
them has a significantly higher 
SAT score, right?” Zhang said. 
“With the SAT, you can see who’s 
most prepared properly for the 
rigors of a higher University.”

The new changes to the SAT 

were designed to address some 
of the inequalities associated 
with the test, according to The 
College Board Press Release. 
The changes will make it so 
schools have more flexibil-
ity in providing a free weekday 
test during school instead of 
requiring students to adhere 
to the strict schedule set by the 

college board like before. 

Research done by Public 

Policy Professor Susan Dynar-
ski found that when Michigan 
made the ACT a requirement 
for all high school juniors in 
2007, the percent of students 
who took the test rose from 54% 
to 99%. Before this require-
ment, only 35% of low income 
students were taking the test 
due to a lack of access to testing 
centers, fees for the test, inter-
net access to sign up for the test, 
and transportation to the test.

The research found that by 

making universal school day 
testing available to all high 
school 
Michigan 
students, 

more 
low-income 
students 

went to and graduated from 
four-year universities. Accord-
ing to the research, the new 
changes to the SAT are intend-
ed to hopefully make universal 
school day testing more acces-
sible to all students. 

Rodriguez said the changes 

to the SAT are about allowing 
students, no matter their back-
ground, access to higher educa-
tion and opportunities. 

“The SAT allows every stu-

dent regardless of where they 
go to high school to be seen,” 
Rodriguez 
wrote. 
“And 
to 

access opportunities that will 
shape their lives and careers.”

 5 bills to watch in the 

Michigan state legislature 

this month

February slate includes distracted driving law, 

sentencing reform

IRENA LI

Daily Staff Reporter

 

or signed into law by the Michigan state 
throughout the past month.


publishes a compilation of bills in the 
Michigan state legislature for students 
 
aware of.

1. Stricter distracted driving 

laws

Status: Passed by the House
On Jan. 25, the Michigan House of 

Representatives passed H.B. 4277 – 
4279, a three-bill package that would 
qualify any phone usage as distracted 
driving. If signed into law, the bills 
would expand the definition of dis-
tracted driving to include any activ-
ity with a mobile device that involves 
the usage of one or more hands. Cur-
rently, Michigan law only explicitly 
outlaws texting while driving.

State Rep. Mari Manoogian, D-Bir-

mingham, introduced the first bill in 
the package and co-sponsored the 
other two. After working for years to 
reduce distracted driving, Manoo-
gian shared her excitement when the 
House passed all three bills in a tweet.

“Honored to share that we passed 

legislation that would modernize 
Michigan’s distracted driving laws,” 
Manoogian wrote. “This legislation 
serves as both a way to encourage bet-
ter behavior from drivers and allows 
our law enforcement to keep those 
who are driving distracted in check.”

In a speech on the House floor, Manoo-

gian mentioned Mitchel Kiefer, who was 
killed in an automobile accident caused by 
a distracted driver in 2016.

“What better way to honor Mitch-

el’s life and legacy than to work to 

ensure that no other family feels the 
pain that his family … has felt every 
day since his passing?” Manoogian 
said.

The first bill passed the House in a 

vote of 75-26 and the other two passed 
76-25, all with bipartisan support.

After passing out of the House, the 

bills were referred to the Senate Judi-
ciary and Public Safety Committee.

2. 
Eliminating 
life 
without 

parole for juveniles

Status: Introduced in the Senate
S.B. 848 – 851 seek to abolish life 

sentences without parole for crimes 
committed by individuals under the 
age of 18 in Michigan. This legislation 
would instead designate a maximum 
prison sentence of 60 years, with the 
possibility for parole review after 10 
years in prison.

Currently, 25 other states and 

the District of Columbia have 
banned 
juvenile 
life 
without 

parole. In the 2012 Miller v. Ala-
bama case, the Supreme Court 
ruled that juvenile life sentences 
without the possibility of parole 
were unconstitutional. Despite 
the ruling, some states, including 
Michigan, retain the possibility 
of juvenile life without parole in 
their state laws. Over 360 juve-
niles in Michigan are currently 
serving life without parole, the 
second highest number in any U.S. 
state. 

State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 

Arbor, introduced S.B. 848 on 
Jan. 27 and co-sponsored the 
other three bills. In a Jan. 31 press 
release, Irwin said Michigan state 
law needs to be amended to be in line 
with the Miller v. Alabama ruling.

“Now that the U.S. Supreme 

Court ruled that our harsh laws

When 
your 
university’s 

president is put on blast for 
flirting through the prover-
bial family iPad, you don’t just 
brush it off.

It’s time to talk about the 

Schlissel memes. They take 
many forms: a Yik Yak post, 
a cheeky affirmation, a spray 
paint installment in the Diag. 
Instead of an outpouring of 
disappointment or grief, stu-
dents are resorting to humor, 
which is easy enough to under-
stand, as joking is the simplest 
way to cope with shame, a 
fact further amplified by the 
absurdity of the situation.

We reached out to a num-

ber of Schlissel memers on 
Instagram for a look into the 
motivations of the students 
indulging in the tomfoolery. 
If you have a pulse and you 
own a cell phone, you probably 
know exactly what I’m talking 
about. @umich_incellectuals, 
best described as a U-M-spe-
cific reimagining of the vastly 
popular meme page @on_a_
downward_spiral, kicked off 
the memes with a series of text 
posts. The earliest read “WE 
JUST LOST THE SCHLUSSY” 
over a portrait of a grinning 
Schlissel. Another said “who 
else up lonelying their ms.” 
My personal favorite from the 
account was an edited photo 
of Schlissel’s twitter with a 
blacked out profile picture 
and “Gone. Don’t text me or 
hmu” in the bio.

@umichcapsbabes, 
which 

popped up fairly recently, 
jumped on the train with a 
similar slew of memes. Their 
most popular, with over 200 
likes, poked fun at the famed 
YouTube 
apology 
format, 

titled “my truth” with Schlis-

sel in the thumbnail. Another 
meme read “me leaving Pizza 
House with 10 extra calzones 
up my ass” over a cheery-faced 
Schlissel.

@umichaffirmations, 

known by almost 12,000 fol-
lowers 
for 
their 
cleverly 

specific 
affirmation-based 

U-M memes, made a carou-
sel post of memes catered 
towards 
Schlissel. 
Some 

include, “I WILL NOT Send 
Raunchy Messages From My 
Work Email,” “WHAT IF WE 
MISSED OUR CONNECTION 

IN PARIS” and “I Will Not Be 
Lured In With The Promise Of 
A Knish.” 

What got to me about @ince-

llectuals and the other pages 
was how fast they respond-
ed to the news and how they 
decided to go about it — for 
some reason, their immediate 
reaction to reading those 118 
emails was to make memes. 
When asked about the use of 
memes as a response, one of 
the 
@umich_incellectuals 

admins responded over Insta-
gram DMs: “I think the memes 
were inevitable, the fuck them 
kids memes were already all 
over campus, we made a few 
too and like rightly so every-
one already had a pretty low 

opinion.” The account’s sec-
ond admin seemed to agree: 
“The way memes came almost 
immediately 
after 
his 
fir-

ing were kind of reflective of 
like the almost comedic rela-
tionship that’s been existing 
between schlissel and the stu-
dent body for nearly 2 years.”

The admin from @umich-

capsbabes had some thoughts 
about the meaning of the 
memes: “What makes them 
funny is that someone took 
time out of their day to make 
an edit for the bursley baits 

loop for absolutely no reason. 
Mark Schlissel is a grown man 
who’s probably at home very 
concerned about his public 
image and everyone else is just 
like yeahhh it makes sense 
that he’s a calzone man.” 

@umichaffirmations’s 

admin ties up the issue with 
a nihilistic bow: “The fact 
that our university president 
is having an affair is an abso-
lutely absurd and unfortu-
nate situation. But so is living 
through a massive pandemic. 
So is the fact that we have 
single-digit weather. We can 
either live life accepting the 
bad things, or cope with them 
via humor.” While I personal-
ly don’t enjoy accepting these 

things with complacency, I 
struggle to find a better alter-
native. But maybe I’m looking 
at it the wrong way. 

Yes, it’s funny — I will never 

get tired of “lonely m”— but 
what exactly is the joke here? 
That our No. 1 ranked Univer-
sity, with its illustrious Board 
of Regents and its $17 billion 
endowment, was spearhead-
ed by someone incompetent 
enough to send hotel receipts 
to Individual 1 over his Uni-
versity email? That our presi-
dent, our emblem, likes his 
calzones with extra mush-
rooms and his salads topped 
with cherries? The latter is 
not so incriminating, but his 
behavior towards Jon Vaughn 
is. Far worse than a string of 
silly emails is the impotent 
response to the Robert Ander-
son case and, most important-
ly, its survivors — Schlissel 
disgraced this institution long 
before 
Communications.pdf 

was in the picture. In fact, 
many might agree that his 
firing in and of itself is hypo-
critical.

There are jokes, but as the 

first 
@umich_incellectuals 

admin says, “At first I thought 
he’d 
been 
fired 
over 
the 

Anderson case, which would 
have been ideal because his 
conduct over that has been 
disgraceful and a huge dark 
cloud over the university.” 

Maybe Schlissel will return 

to the comfort of his tenure as 
a professor. Maybe some right-
fully vindictive MCDB majors 
will heckle him to embarrassment 
during office hours, or maybe he 
will retreat into his 401(k)-pad-
ded cave and never be heard from 
again. There’s also the possibility 
that Mary Sue Coleman won’t do 
a better job. At the very least, the 
idea that our frustrations might 
become a tangible force is reas-
suring.

It’s time to talk about the Schlissel memes

‘The Woman in the 
House Across the 

Street from the Girl in 
the Window’ is just as 
confusing as its title

Now, who doesn’t love psy-

chological 
thrillers? 
How 

about 
psychological 
thrill-

ers with a little bit of satire? 
Netflix’s original series “The 
Woman in the House Across 
the Street from the Girl in the 
Window” is exactly that. At 
least, that’s what it’s supposed 
to be. 

The 
show’s 
protagonist 

Anna is played by the beauti-
fully gifted Kristen Bell (“Do, 
Re & Mi”). After struggling 
with a divorce and the unex-
pected death of her daugh-
ter, Anna spends most of her 
time sitting in a chair drink-
ing colossal amounts of wine 
while looking out her front 
window. But her interest is 
piqued when a hot new neigh-
bor and single father, Neil 
(Tom Riley, “The Nevers”), 
and his daughter Emma (Sam-
sara Leela Yett, “Don’t Look 
Up”) move in right across the 
street. After spending some 
one-on-one time with Neil, 
Anna truly thinks this connec-
tion is something. However, 
it quickly fizzles when Neil’s 
flight 
attendant 
girlfriend 

Lisa (Shelley Hennig, “Mythic 
Quest”) shows up at his house 
for a few days. Back to the 
window Anna goes until, in a 
jarring turn of events, she wit-
nesses Lisa’s gruesome mur-
der. Or does she? 

The trailer frames the show 

as 
something 
serious 
and 

thrilling that plays within its 
mystery and suspense tropes. 
Yet, you can’t help but realize 
that the plot looks a bit out of 
place and is a tad bit cringey. 
But that’s for good reason: The 
show is a parody of both the 
Netflix thriller, “The Woman 
in the Window,” and the film 
“The Girl on the Train.” Unfor-
tunately, it does a terrible job 
of doing so. 

Granted, there are some 

funny moments that attempt 
to demonstrate its dark com-
edy, like Anna appearing to be 
so terrified of the rain touch-
ing her skin that she literally 
succumbs to it in the most dra-
matic way. Or, take the infinite 
amount of chicken casserole 
Anna makes every night, only 
for it to repeatedly burn her 
hands or be dropped and shat-
tered, and then appear again 
the next night.

Regardless, the show strug-

gles to figure out its genre. 
There’s no way to tell it is a 
parody unless you’re familiar 
with the films it ridicules, nor 
does it present itself as a com-
edy, and then ultimately loses 
itself in its assumed genre of 
dark tragedy. However, it does 
hook the audience, making it a 
binge-able show, but viewers 
are only clicking to the next 
episode to find out more about 
Anna’s character and what she 
witnessed.

Overlooking 
the 
failed 

attempt at portraying itself 
as a parody, the show gives a 
true insight into the process of 
grieving a loved one. It doesn’t 
hold back when representing 
what it means to heal your-
self, and how hard that can 
be. Anna’s character is clear-
ly struggling with not only 
the loss of her daughter but 
the pain of a divorce, which 
explains her off-the-wall per-
sonality. It truly establishes a 
sense of empathy for Anna’s 
character which gives this 
show a semblance of realism 
that some satirical psychologi-
cal thrillers lack. 

Overall, this show has no 

identity. It can be a parody, a 
dark comedy, a thriller — hon-
estly, it is whatever you want it 
to be. But one thing is for sure: 
“The Woman in the House 
Across the Street from the Girl 
in the Window” is just as con-
fusing as its title.

‘Daughter of the Moon 

Goddess’ has pining 
lovers and dragons

The first installment of Sue 

Lynn Tan’s duology, “Daughter 
of the Moon Goddess,” remains 
engrossing until the final page. 
It is the perfect book to accom-
pany a hot pot of tea and a steady 
stream of snacks — you will read 
it in one sitting, I promise. Tan’s 
novel, straightforward in its lit-
erary offerings, delivers on all 
fronts: adventure, romance and 
xianxia (Chinese mythology/fan-
tasy) genre elements. The novel 
“Daughter of the Moon Goddess” 
diverges from the growing body 
of Asian fantasy series by cover-
ing heavenly immortals rather 
than the archetypal mortal pro-
tagonist. The bulk of the novel is 
set on the Celestial Plane, away 
from earthly squabbles. So yes, 
for anyone familiar with Chi-
nese art history and iconography, 
the immortal characters do ride 
clouds in “Daughter of the Moon 
Goddess.”

As the title declares, the main 

character is Xingyin, a daughter 
born of the Moon’s union with a 
legendary human archer. Howev-
er, because the governing celes-
tial beings have punished and 
mandated that the Moon God-
dess remain solitary, Xingyin’s 
existence must be kept secret. 
Thus, when celestial agents come 
to investigate the Moon’s pal-
ace, Xingyin is forced to leave 
her mother’s side and is spirited 
away in the dead of night. Away 
from home for the first time, Xin-
gyin assumes a new identity in a 
major Celestial city, where she 
comes into the orbit of the prince 

of the realm, accompanying him 
to his lessons and to his military 
practice. As befitting her parent-
age, Xingyin’s fantastic skill with 
the bow helps her quickly start 
attracting recognition. The first 
half of the book opens with the 
promise of upward mobility and 
ambition fulfilled.

However, as the novel pro-

gresses, the overall messaging 
becomes murkier. Tan spins a 
story in which skill and talent do 
not necessarily make for a good 
life and abiding by the oppres-
sive whims of a celestial monar-
chy does not ensure long-term 
security. Xingyin moves through 
the book attempting to create a 
stable life for herself, but she is 
effectively the fantastical equiva-
lent of an undocumented citizen 
in this celestial realm. The threat 
of exposure hangs over Xingyin. 
If she ever were to reveal her par-
entage, she and her mother would 
be horribly punished.

I got too much joy from read-

ing this book. Beyond the novel’s 
plot, what I liked the most was 
how it dwelled on and indulged in 
jealousy and love. The novel was 
not afraid to portray pining lov-
ers, miserable in their separation. 
While similar books might induce 
headaches in their portrayals of 
yearning, “Daughter of the Moon 
Goddess” elicited sympathy — in 
part because the pining lovers 
(their reunion, their separation) 
embodied bigger issues facing the 
protagonist. Xingyin, through 
romance and friendship, takes 
ownership of her skill and, even-
tually, her own identity and par-
entage.

There 
aren’t 
many 
bands 

that can successfully combine 
a traditional rock instrumenta-
tion with saxophone, violin and 
acoustic piano, but Black Coun-
try, New Road have made a name 
for themselves precisely by forg-
ing those elements into a truly 
one-of-a-kind sound. Last year, 
the band teased their potential 
with their debut album For the 
First Time, a chaotic and noisy 
work that combined sprawl-
ing compositions, mesmerizing 
instrumentals and gritty vocal 
performances into a mind-bend-
ing, futuristic rock piece. It’s 
difficult for any band to follow 

up on an album as over-the-top 
as their previous one, but with 
their latest release, Ants from Up 
There, Black Country, New Road 
diversifies their sound without 
compromising what makes them 
one of the most fresh and unique 
rock bands today.

The 
instrumental 
prowess 

that has always been central to 
Black Country, New Road’s iden-
tity is once again on full display 
on Ants from Up There, even 
as the band plays with differ-
ent musical textures across the 
album’s 10 tracks. The noisiness 
that defined their debut record 
is still present in some songs 
on Ants, such as “Haldern” and 
“Basketball Shoes,” which fea-
ture all of the band members 
playing at once. However, the 

band also finds new ways of mak-
ing a powerful sound without 
simply relying on thick instru-
mentation. 
The 
nine-minute 

song “Snow Globes” has one of 
the most intense climaxes on the 
entire album thanks to Charlie 
Wayne’s ridiculous drumming, 
which swells up to eventually 
drown out the delicate repeating 
musical ideas in the saxophone, 
piano and violin.

Just as the band has evolved 

their ability to be loud and hec-
tic, they also show songwriting 
growth. There are songs where 
this is obvious, like “Mark’s 
Theme,” 
a 
beautiful 
instru-

mental featuring an emotion-
al saxophone solo and piano 
accompaniment. But most of the 
time, the revamped songwriting 

is more subtle. By avoiding the 
abrasive sounds they previously 
embraced, the band is able to 
create pleasant, accessible songs 
that are still engaging. One 
example of this is “The Place 
Where He Inserted the Blade,” 
a seven-minute track influenced 
by late-career Bob Dylan that 
has more than enough variety 
to stay engaging — but not too 
much where that it undermines 
the song’s strong sense of har-
monic direction.

For as many new directions 

Black Country, New Road take 
that pay off, the album’s biggest 
weakness is that it’s a little too 
safe most of the time, particu-
larly compared to their ground-
breaking debut. The klezmer 
melodies and irregular rhythms 

the band mastered on For the 
First Time are teased on the 
album’s very short intro track, 
but after that, they are sel-
dom present as the band tends 
towards standard Western har-
monies and rhythmic patterns. 
Many fans will probably prefer 
this album for that reason, but 
even if For the First Time was 
uncomfortable to listen to at 
times, its moments of irregular-
ity served as points of interest 
that feel missing on new good-
but-not-great tracks like “Chaos 
Space Marine” and “Good Will 
Hunting.” The album is gener-
ally at its best when it’s pushing 
musical boundaries, even just 
on the short, dissonant outro to 
“Haldern,” which serves as an 
audible reminder of the cost of 

the band’s new, safer style.

Ants from Up There is a bit-

tersweet album: Just days before 
it was released, Black Country, 
New Road vocalist Isaac Wood 
announced his departure from 
the group. Wood’s distinctive 
vocals and lyricism were inte-
gral to the band’s innovative 
sound; replacing his impact will 
be impossible. With Wood’s 
departure, Ants from Up There 
serves as the end of an era for 
the band, a brief time that will 
be remembered fondly thanks 
to this album and its predeces-
sor. Whatever the future holds 
for the individual musicians of 
Black Country, New Road, this 
album shows that each of them is 
oozing with musical talent, and 
their futures are bright. 

‘Ants from Up There’ pleasantly concludes the first era of Black Country, New Road

In an ideal world, ‘The Fallout’ wouldn’t exist. 

In our world, it has to.
Process over product: A 

preview of the student-run 
production of ‘Dogfight’

Content warning: gun violence and 

school shootings

I still remember the exact date: 

March 16, 2019, when my friends and I 
were studying in the Hatcher Graduate 
Library. It was a Saturday, the day before 
St. Patrick’s Day. I remember this because 
on our way there we’d passed fraternity 
houses filled with students celebrating 
“St. Fratty’s Day.”

We’d talked about leaving the library 

and getting something to eat at South 
Quad, but any thoughts of tendies or soft 
serve left our minds as we started see-
ing the messages sent to org group chats: 
There was an active shooter in Mason 
Hall.

I had gotten the first text, but I waited 

to tell everyone else about it until they 
had also gotten one (something that they 
relentlessly tease me about now). But 
the truth is that I was in a strange state 
of denial, a clouded sense that it couldn’t 
be real, or maybe a sliver of desire that 
if I pretended I hadn’t seen the text, it 
wouldn’t be true. But soon enough, there 
were more texts from more sources, and 
the problem became something I couldn’t 
ignore.

We all packed up our stuff. We were 

on the fourth floor, so we started climb-
ing stairs — up to the eighth floor, since 
we figured that the higher up we were, 
the safer we would be. The eighth floor is 
small, mostly offices and a hallway, with 

two entrances. My friend had a thick belt 
that we used to keep one door locked, and 
we latched the other one with the power 
duo of a bolt and a laptop charger tied 
around a bar sticking out of the frame.

Other people in the building had the 

same idea. People started joining us pret-
ty soon after we’d arrived. I saw two girls 
I knew from an org we were in; I never 
talked to them about it later. In total, there 
were probably 25-30 people crammed 
into that little hallway, leaning against 
the walls, staring out the windows.

We listened to the police scanner, 

heard them speculate about suspects 
and apprehend them. We gasped as they 
heard them talk about a suspect heading 
towards the UGLi. (I later heard stories 
about people holed up in the basement of 
the UGLi who were hiding behind tables, 
listening to the police scanner and think-
ing that that was the moment they were 
going to die.) Some kid tried to pick the 
lock to get into one of the offices in the 
hopes that we could hide in there, where 
it was less exposed. People around me 
were calling their parents, their boy-
friends and other loved ones, staying on 
the line while we waited.

I’ll spare you the tension, because the 

truth was that there was no shooter. A 
group of people had popped balloons in 
a Mason classroom that, muffled and 
distant, sounded like gunshots. But we 
had no way of knowing that. We were up 
in that hallway for about 45 minutes, lis-
tening to the scanner, waiting for some-
thing to happen. We heard officers on the 
scanner checking every floor of Hatcher 
before they finally made their way up 
to us. They knocked on the door, stared 

blankly at our makeshift laptop charger-
defensive measure and escorted us out.

In a post-Columbine world, grade 

schools all have lockdown drills — safety-
based plans for handling an active shoot-
er or suspicious person or any other kind 
of active threat. I have distinct memories 
of sitting stock-still in my classroom in 
elementary school, with the lights off and 
a couple dozen students clustered in a 
shadowy corner, away from the windows. 
The worst part was when the principal 
and other admin would come by and rat-
tle the doorknobs, checking to make sure 
they’d been locked. Still, there was always 
a gasp in the room, and I would lock eyes 
with some of my classmates long enough 
to know that we were all thinking the 
same thing: that maybe it was an intruder, 
and that the drill was no longer a drill but 
had morphed into reality. It was terrify-
ing to think that you were next.

Throughout my thirteen years in the 

public school system, there were moments 
that brushed against the idea of a real 
school shooting. Group reading time in 
first grade turned into an impromptu 
lockdown when a man a few streets over 
began threatening to kill himself with his 
firearm. There was a football game my 
freshman year of high school when our 
principal came on the loudspeaker before 
the game had started to announce that 
a nearby high school had experienced a 
school shooting earlier that day. When 
I was a senior, my high school had three 
bomb or gun threats within two weeks, 
all hoaxes, but overwhelming enough 
that the district canceled high school 

classes for a day in the hopes that every-
thing would reset.

But for the most part, school shootings 

were something that happened Some-
where Else. It was the tragic thing you 
saw on the news, the thing that made 
people gasp and then say, “This time 
things will change.” Every high school’s 
name has an effect, but it’s an effect that 
seems to fade with time, until we forget. 
It always felt like everything went back to 
normal immediately after the moment of 
silence had ended — not because it wasn’t 
tragic, but because it was routine. These 
were not my schools, not in my home-
towns; the victims were not my friends, 
or my neighbors, or my teachers. We, the 
mostly unaffected, could move on as if 
nothing had changed.

The week after the “shooting” on cam-

pus, I found myself getting into strange 
conversations with people about what 
had happened. I started to realize that my 
experience was somewhat unique com-
pared to the wider university community: 
It was a Saturday, and there were maybe a 
thousand people in buildings around the 
Diag. To most people, they could forget 
about the incident as soon as the weekend 
passed; for me, it stuck with me for weeks 
at the front of my mind. “Hi, I’m Kari 
Anderson, I’m a freshman, and my fun 
fact is that I sort of thought I was going to 
die in Hatcher last month.”

Because things are different when 

you’re the one who is affected. Even if the 
“shooting” itself was fake, the fear was 
absolutely real. That hour I spent on the 
top floor of Hatcher, sitting on the hall-
way floor and listening to the police scan-
ner, was a blur of emotion, but the main 

one I remember was uncertainty — both 
“what’s going to happen?” and “what am 
I supposed to do now?” My friends and I, 
and the rest of the people hiding on the 
top floor of Hatcher, were escorted down 
the elevator by officers holding the largest 
guns I’ve ever seen in my life. We walked 
out of Hatcher that day and headed off 
campus to a friend’s apartment. Later 
that day, I went back to my dorm and ate 
cake that my RA gave me. We stood in the 
tiny kitchen eating cake and talking about 
how balloons could cause so much dam-
age.

Because that was the thing I kept get-

ting stuck on. The shots were never veri-
fied by DPSS. No one sent out any security 
alerts. All of the communication was done 
through students frantically texting 
friends and org group chats. The word 
traveled about an active shooter in Mason 
Hall, and so the students who were on 
campus that day, the post-Columbine 
generation, acted accordingly. None of 
us — the students on campus, the people 
attending the vigil on the Diag that day, 
the officers making their way through 
every single building on campus — ques-
tioned whether it was real.

25 years ago, school shootings weren’t 

even a thought. Now they’re an expecta-
tion.

It’s been almost three years since that 

moment. Most of the students at Michi-
gan don’t remember that it happened, 
and even fewer who were actually there 
are still on campus. People don’t men-
tion it often, if at all. Enough time has 
passed that we can joke about it. But for 
me, there’s still a part of my Michigan 
experience that will always be stuck with 
the time that I sat in Hatcher for 45 min-
utes and contemplated my own mortality 
while a team of law enforcement officers 
scoured every single building on the Diag.

In all of my close calls, it was the closest 

I’ve ever come to a school shooting. And it 
wasn’t even real. We walked away from 
that moment shaken up, alive and deeply 
confused. Theoretically, it was just about 
the best case scenario. But I can’t help 
but think of the kind of place we’re living 
in. We all instantly jumped to the worst 
possible conclusions because that’s life in 
the United States: the only place where 
school shootings are the expectation.

That’s where “The Fallout” comes in 

— a 2021 South by Southwest Film Festi-
val entry that was just given widespread 
streaming access on HBO Max. The film 
tackles the issue of school shootings 
head-on with unflinching clarity. Many 
critics are focusing on “The Fallout” as a 
definitive Gen Z movie — not just because 
of the way that the characters speak and 
interact with cell phones but because of 
how they see the world. We are one of 
the first generations where school shoot-
ings are not an unthinkable scenario but a 
potentially real threat. Kids in the United 
States grow up going to school with metal 
detectors, security guards, lockdown 
drills and the ever-present hope that their 
high school won’t be the next one trend-
ing in the news.

***

The beginning of “The Fallout” is a 

normal school day. Vada (Jenna Ortega, 
“Scream”), the main character, brushes 
her teeth, squabbles with her sister Ame-
lia (Lumi Pollack, feature debut), and 
drives to school with her best friend Nick 
(Will Ropp, “The Way Back”). Vada hap-
pens to be in the bathroom with Mia Reed 
(Maddie Ziegler, “The Book of Henry”), 
a near stranger who she goes to school 
with. Then they hear shots, then screams, 
and they rush to hide in the stall.

The entire shooting is over before the 

10-minute-mark of the film, shown only 
through what Vada and Mia hear in the 
bathroom. The rest of the film is devoted 
to what happens once the coast is clear — 
because what do you do next when things 
aren’t life-or-death anymore, but you’re 
still stuck in the trauma of thinking you 
were going to die?

Based on the 1991 film of the 

same name, “Dogfight,” the 2012 
musical, was an instant success. 
Originating as an Off-Broadway 
production, the heart-wrenching 
show has now been performed 
across the world and translated 
into various languages. Although 
Music, Theatre & Dance alumni 
Benj Pasek and Justin Paul craft-
ed the music and lyrics for “Dog-

fight,” it has never been performed 
at the University of Michigan until 
now.

“Dogfight” follows the story of 

Corporal Eddie Birdlace, a Marine 
who has just one free night before 
being deployed to Southeast Asia. 
To pass the time, Eddie and his 
best friends, Boland and Bern-
stein, compete to see who can find 
the “ugliest” woman to bring to a 
party (a.k.a dogfight) where she 
will be judged on her appearance. 
When Eddie meets Rose Fenny, 
however, his perspective on this 
degrading game — and on love — 
shifts. In an in-person interview 
with The Michigan Daily, musical 
director Andrew Gerace, a Music, 
Theatre & Dance and LSA senior, 
called “Dogfight” “a story of love 
and loss and terrible error and 
redemption.”

Even those who know the show 

“will leave the theatre surprised” 
agreed Gerace and Director Jules 
Garber, a Music, Theatre & Dance 
and LSA senior.

“If you just know the music, it 

sounds like it will be a happy story. 
But when you add the text it is a lot 
heavier,” said Gerace. 

On why “Dogfight” was selected 

to be performed now, Gerace, who 
is majoring in political science, 
explained that “The Vietnam War 
and the conf lict in Afghanistan 
had similar lenses. I saw compar-
ison photos of the U.S. military 
leaving Vietnam next to the U.S. 
military leaving Afghanistan. For 
me, it felt like an appropriate time 
to reconsider how we view war, 
conf lict and the U.S. military.”

In 
an 
effort 
to 
respect 

“Dogfight”’s heavy material and 
develop an effective piece, the 
producers employed a mantra of 
“process over product.” The cre-
ative team worked to approach the 
show with a DEI-focused and com-
munity-care approach — serving 
as an example for all students who 
work with heavy artistic material. 
Working with a DEI Coordinator 
helped actors come to “language 
agreements” 
about 
problematic 

lines their characters say to ensure 
comfort on the actors’ behalf. As 
stated by Gerace, “Dogfight’’’s 
text is inherently f lawed … there 
are things not acceptable in 2022 
that were acceptable in 2012.”

Producer Allie Kench, an Engi-

neering 
graduate 
and 
current 

Business Graduate student, noted 
that “It has been a priority to focus 
on the process at the forefront and 
letting the product follow. A pro-
cess that has all the elements like 
DEI work, like intimacy coordina-
tion, making sure that every team 
member feels supported that will 
ultimately create a great process.” 
Kench also shared that as the 
show has “scenes and moments of 
assault. I saw the production as an 
opportunity to create a larger dia-
logue on assault.” Accordingly, she 
helped to bring a Sexual Assault 

Prevention and Awareness Center 
(SAPAC) workshop called “Michi-
gan Men” on harmful masculin-
ity to the cast and team. SAPAC 
agreed to modify the workshop 
so that the team could talk about 
“both (the cast and teams’) expe-
riences 
(regarding 
masculinity) 

at Michigan … but also the char-
acters, the content of the show 
and the story. It was twofold” said 
Kench. 

When asked what differentiates 

this version of “Dogfight” from 
others, Garber shared that “Being 
a non-binary person leading an 
incredibly male-dominated cast … 
brings a lot to (the) show and makes 
it a vastly different production.” 
Further, they said the creative 
team was “making an intentional 
choice to have different inter-
pretations of the characters than 
people normally see presented.” In 
their directing, they made certain 
to deviate from the version of Rose 
that is often “copy and pasted in 
most productions.” Further, Gar-
ber said “It’s different watching 
a 28-year-old play a boy going to 
war than watching kids between 
18-22, the age these kids (in the 
show) were going to war. You real-
ize they are kids … that they were 
sending kids to war. This makes it 
hard to watch, but it adds some-
thing you don’t get in (all produc-
tions of ‘Dogfight.’)” 

Challenging the ways in which 

“Dogfight” 
is 
often 
performed 

while maintaining a staunch com-
mitment to dramaturgy, this pro-
duction is sure to be exciting, 
tear-jerking and meaningful. A 
bold exploration of masculinity 
and war, this student-run produc-
tion “Dogfight” is a testament to 
how great art can be made through 
a thoughtful process.

“Dogfight” will be performed at 

the Arthur Miller Theatre on Feb. 
11 and 12 at 8 p.m. and Feb. 13 at 
2 p.m. All admission is free and 
seating will be filled on a first-
come-first-serve basis. Those hop-
ing to see the show are advised to 
get there early! Audience members 
should be aware of the sensitive 
and potentially triggering subject 
matter of the piece. “Dogfight,” in 
particular, grapples with themes 
of masculinity, assault and racism.

Are you a hopeless romantic who is 

always reading about all things love? 
Whether you’re single or in a relation-
ship this Valentine’s Day, the Daily Book 
Review has you covered. Some of these 
books are fantasy, while others are con-
temporary romances that deserve all the 
hype. With a wide variety of romances 
and tropes galore, here are six books we 
think you’ll love.

“Love and Other Words” by Chris-

tina Lauren 

“Love and Other Words” by best 

friends and co-writing duo that go by the 
pen name “Christina Lauren” will not 
only bring you to tears but will restore 
your faith in the friends-to-lovers trope.

Macy Sorensen is the woman with a 

plan. All she needs to do is focus on her 
job, marry her older (and financially sta-
ble) fiancé and, most importantly, shove 
the mere thought of Elliot Petropoulos to 
the back of her mind. Her plan goes per-
fectly fine until she runs into him for the 
first time in 10 years. 

After Macy’s mother died, her father 

bought a summer house outside of San 
Francisco where she spent all her week-
ends and summers growing up — with 
Elliot. Forever holed up reading and dis-
cussing words together, the two formed a 
seemingly everlasting friendship. When 
their friendship turned into something 
more, it wasn’t long until everything was 
ruined in just one night. 

Told in dual timelines — starting from 

the moment Macy and Elliot meet as 
teenagers to when they meet again as

“Take a Hint, Dani Brown” by Talia 

Hibbert 

“Take a Hint, Dani Brown” by Talia 

Hibbert tells the story of how one woman 
who doesn’t believe in romance finds her-
self in a fake relationship with her friend 
from work after they accidentally go viral. 

As a PhD student, Danika Brown is 

a focused, career-driven woman. She 
has no time for relationships, especially 
after the way things ended with her last 
girlfriend. Besides, she’d rather have 

something casual with no commitment 
required. Ex-rugby player Zafir Ansari 
works as a security guard at Dani’s uni-
versity. Although he has a brooding exte-
rior, he is a hopeless romantic who just 
wants his own happily-ever-after. His 
heart, however, has been guarded ever 
since an accident that left his family dev-
astated. 

Dani and Zaf are just friends, but after 

Zaf heroically saves Dani during a fire 
drill and the rescue is captured on video, 
the two go viral. With everyone — includ-
ing the universe — encouraging them to 
make it official as #DrRugbae, they start 
to fake-date. Zaf needs the publicity for 
his children’s sports charity, and Dani 
could certainly benefit from the friends-
with-benefits situation they agree upon. 
What do they have to lose? 

This hilarious and sexy contemporary 

romance explores the idea of vulnerabil-
ity in relationships while also tackling 
heavier topics like anxiety and griev-
ing the death of loved ones. Filled with 
diverse and loveable characters, “Take a 
Hint, Dani Brown” is the rom-com you 
won’t want to put down.

“It Happened One Summer” by 

Tessa Bailey

“It Happened One Summer” by Tessa 

Bailey is perfect for anyone looking for 
a fun and spicy romance in the vein of 
“Schitt’s Creek.” 

Piper Bellinger is a Los Angeles 

socialite known for her partying and 
short-lived relationships. After her lat-
est adventure goes awry and she ends up 
behind bars, her stepfather puts his foot 
down. He sends Piper and her sister Han-
nah away for the summer to learn some 
responsibility in a small fishermen’s town 
where their late father grew up. When the 
sisters arrive, they meet the local fish-
ing boat captain, Brendan Taggart, who 
doesn’t take a liking to the newcomers 
but can’t seem to stay away from Piper. 
Brendan is too grumpy for her, and Piper 
is too spoiled for him — they are the per-
fect match. 

As Piper finds herself living in a mouse-

infested apartment above their father’s 
old dive bar, she sets out to restore the bar 
to its former glory and prove to everyone 
around her, especially Brendan, that she’s 
capable of making something of herself. 

“It Happened One Summer” is a worth-

while summer romance sprinkled with 
authentic self-discovery and characters 
with chemistry that dance across the 

page.

“Five Tuesdays In Winter” by Lily 

King 

(TW: sexual assault)
Lily King’s fifth novel is just as enam-

oring and well-delivered as her previous 
work and perfect for anyone hoping to 
read about love but also loss, grief and tri-
als.

“Five Tuesdays In Winter” features 

10 short stories all focusing on differ-
ent characters who are written with 
immense care and complexity. Among 
other enthralling characters, the reader 
learns about a bookseller who tries to 
love again, a mother-daughter pair work-
ing through a loss and a woman pulled in 
two different directions when it comes to 
her love life. “Five Tuesdays In Winter” 
doesn’t just cover romantic love — though 
there’s plenty of that — but rather looks at 
desire and the need for love at all costs, 
whether platonic, familial or unrequited.

This book isn’t an easy read — far from 

it. Some of the stories are difficult to read 
as the characters are overcoming the 
sometimes violent events of their past and 
present. However, what shines through is 

King’s ability to leave the reader hope-
ful, not only for the characters, but for 
humanity itself.

“Carry On” by Rainbow Rowell 
For fans of Harry Potter, “Carry On” by 

Rainbow Rowell is the romance that J.K. 
Rowling never gave her readers.

Simon Snow is the “chosen one” 

returning to wizarding school for his last 
year. While everyone is hoping Simon 
can save their world from the evil Insidi-
ous Humdrum, Simon is upset because 
he just went through a breakup and his 
vampire roommate Baz, who he claims 
is his “nemesis,” has been absent for the 
first two months of the school year, much 
to Simon’s dismay. The story really begins 
when Baz makes his entrance and joins 
forces with Simon to help defeat evil — 
all while the pair become “friends” and 
eventually, more than that.

If any of that sounds familiar, you’ve 

probably read Harry Potter. While “Carry 
On” can stand alone just fine, it is bet-
tered with some background knowledge 
because it’s essentially well-written fan-
fiction — superior to anything you could 
ever find on Wattpad. While the plot is 

interesting enough, what really shines 
through is the relationship between 
Simon and Baz, which is every bit as 
romantic as a good enemies-to-lovers 
trope should be.

“The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue” 

by V.E. Schwab

“The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue” 

stands out not only as a solid addition to 
the fantasy fiction genre but also as a love 
story worthy of the hype it has received.

Told in flashbacks between early 1700s 

France and present-day NYC, “The Invis-
ible Life of Addie LaRue” spans many dif-
ferent historical events and time periods. 
When Addie LaRue is forced into a mar-
riage she doesn’t want, she makes a deal 
with the god of the night that will allow 
her to escape the nuptials and give her 
all the time and freedom she desires, on 
the condition that no person will ever 
remember her — until someone does. 

“The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue” is 

a testament to the power and intimacy of 
truly being known by another person and 
is a perfect read for someone seeking an 
epic love story with plot to back it up.

Six romances to read this Valentine’s Day

Marketing films the ‘Spidey’ Way

‘Murderville’ is comedy gold

Writer’s Note: Spoilers for 

“Spider-Man: No Way Home” 
ahead.

Today, it is hard to imagine a 

blockbuster movie hitting the 
big screen without an extensive 
promotional campaign. From 
interviews to ad spots to teas-
ers and trailers, production 
houses make sure that going 
into the weekend of its release, 
everybody is talking about their 
movie. Having said that, until 
not too long ago, films didn’t 
consider an extensive promo-
tional campaign a priority, much 
less a crucial part of their suc-
cess.

That all changed in 1975 when 

the marketing team at “Jaws” 
released a poster that would 
reverberate around the world 
for years. At the time, “Jaws” 
looked like it was going to be 
an expensive disaster, with the 
movie taking 159 days to shoot, 
almost three times longer than 
what was planned, and its pro-
tagonist, a robot shark, barely 
working. In order to rescue what 
seemed like a lost cause, Univer-
sal, the production house behind 
“Jaws,” poured over $1.8 million 
into the film’s marketing cam-

paign — an amount that took its 
production budget up to $9 mil-
lion, more than any other movie 
released that year. The result: 
It went on to become the first 
American movie in history to 
cross the $7 million mark, pav-
ing the pathway for how produc-
tion houses market their movies 
to this day. 

On Jan. 17, exactly one month 

after its release, “Spider-Man: 
No Way Home” beat “Avengers: 
Infinity War” to become the 
fifth-highest grossing movie in 
the U.S. box office, making more 
than $650 million. As of Feb. 3, it 
sits fourth on the list of highest 
grossing films in the U.S., mak-
ing over $730 million. Presum-
ably, those $730 million will go a 
long way towards making up for 
the reported $202 million spent 
by Marvel on the film’s market-
ing. Although it is commonplace 
for movies to use the wide range 
of social media sites at their dis-
posal for promotional purposes, 
the latest installment in Peter 
Parker’s misadventures pulled 
out all the stops, raising the 
question: How much marketing 
is too much marketing?

The answer varies from one 

situation to the next, but the 
marketing campaign for “No 
Way Home” most definitely 
split opinions before its release. 

Between 
the 
movie’s 
Twit-

ter and Instagram, the Official 
Daily Bugle TikTok and the 
countless 
interviews, 
trail-

ers and promo videos posted 
by Sony and Marvel, fans were 
treated to a barrage of content 
in the weeks leading up to the 
film. In the 40 days before its 
worldwide release, the movie’s 
Instagram made 59 posts, and 
has made a further 63 since, 
averaging roughly three posts 
every two days. Even online 
communities far removed from 
the world of comic book mov-
ies found the likes of Tom Hol-
land and Zendaya popping up on 
their screens, with the duo mak-
ing appearances at the Ballon 
d’Or (aka the Oscars of the soc-
cer world) and even interview-
ing players from Tom Holland’s 
favorite soccer team. Spidey fan 
or not, if you were on the inter-
net in the month leading up to 
the movie, at the very least you 
heard about it. 

There is an argument to be 

made that such an extensive, 
in-your-face promotional cam-
paign could discourage some 
viewers from avoiding them 
and potentially even the movie 
entirely. Prior to watching the 
film, LSA sophomore Arjun 
Arora said, “I haven’t seen any 
of the trailers. I don’t know any-

thing … and I actually like that.” 
Nevertheless, Marvel and Sony 
were well aware of who made 
up the majority of their fanbase: 
the comic book community. 
A community that thrives on 
speculation, ardent fans of the 
webslinger and the Marvel Cin-
ematic Universe welcomed the 
barrage of posters and movie 
footage Marvel and Sony sent 
their way. From YouTube to 
TikTok, the internet was rife 
with theories and predictions as 
fans looked into every frame and 
charted out every possibility to 
such an extent that the online 
community became pseudo mar-
keting officials themselves. 

What added to all of the 

excitement were the leaks — an 
eventuality Marvel and Sony, 
with all their experience over 
the years, knew was inevitable. 
However, the spoilers might 
have worked to their advantage 
this time around. People weren’t 
complaining about the amount 
of promotional content being 
released, because with every 
piece of content that did not 
confirm their rumors and sus-
picions, the anticipation grew. 
For example, although Alfred 
Molina’s (“The Da Vinci Code”) 
return as Doc Ock had been 
leaked months before any real 
marketing had begun, Marvel 

and Sony were still able to capi-
talize on it. Between this leak 
and the release of the movie’s 
first trailer, fan speculation 
regarding the return of not only 
Doc Ock, but a litany of old Spi-
derman villains, was sky-high. 
“No Way Home” obliged, and, 
with said trailer, confirmed all 
the rumors floating around, 
resulting in the most successful 

opening 24 hours a trailer has 
ever had. It was the perfect way 
to kickstart a marketing cam-
paign that would remain flaw-
less from start to finish. 

Yes, a set of innovative post-

ers would do the trick. Even in 
today’s time, not every market-

ing campaign needs to be as in-
your-face as “No Way Home” 
was, and not every marketing 
campaign requires the use of 
social media. However, Marvel 
and Sony showed just how ben-
eficial it can be to a movie’s suc-
cess, commercially and in terms 
of popularity. Not only that, they 
wproved that if your campaign is 
well planned, bombarding fans 

with promotional content isn’t 
all that bad an idea, especially 
when theorizing is one of their 
favorite pastimes. Peter Parker 
may be “Public Enemy No. 1” in 
the Spiderverse, but in the real 
world, the headlines were lov-
ing him.

Murder mysteries have been 

a popular genre in the main-
stream for a long time. From the 
first Sherlock Holmes book, “A 
Study in Scarlet,” to the hit film 
“Knives Out,” the archetype 
of the story remains consis-
tent: someone is murdered, an 
investigation ensues with hints 
pointing toward the true culprit 
and then a final gathering with 
all the suspects convenes and 
a murderer is declared. There 
may be a couple unexpected ele-
ments in the story, but mostly 
they follow this outline. Netf-
lix’s new show, “Murderville” is 

no exception. However, it has its 
own twist: improvisation. 

The show drops the audience 

in an old-style police station, 
with homicide detective and 
main character Terry Seattle, 
played by Will Arnett (“Bojack 
Horseman”). Seattle opens with 
a grizzled-detective monologue, 
alluding to classic openings for 
the genre. However, in the third 
shot, the audience sees he is 
driving a pickup-style Camaro, 
and from then on it’s obvious 
this is not your normal murder 
mystery. Seattle’s internal solil-
oquy is then interrupted by the 
police chief (Haneefah Wood, 
“Nurse Jackie”) to briefly dis-
cuss the aftermath of her and 
Seattle’s divorce. Arnett is abso-

lutely fantastic in his role. He is 
quick-witted with his one-liners 
and joke setups, especially dur-
ing his satires of internal dia-
logues and classic police banter. 
He is able to play out any scene 
to get some laughs, but the main 
draw of the show is the wide 
variety of celebrity guest stars.

There are a total of six celeb-

rity guest stars, one for each 
episode 
released, 
including 

Conan 
O’Brien, 
Marshawn 

Lynch, Kumail Nanjiani, Annie 
Murphy, Sharon Stone and Ken 
Jeong. This isn’t a completely 
new idea — iconic series like 
“Scooby-Doo” also featured a 
number of guest stars ‘playing 
themselves,’ but the most inter-
esting part about this show is 

that the guest stars have to com-
pletely improvise every line. 
The audience gets a wide range 
of experiences from each guest 
star. O’Brien, famous for his 
comedic talk show, was a great 
opening for the show. It was 
obvious that he had experience 
on television and knew how to 
follow an improvised scene, but 
surprisingly it was legendary 
retired Seattle Seahawks run-
ning back Lynch who stole the 
show. He was absolutely hysteri-
cal, throwing out quip after quip 
and keeping pace with the scene. 
Knowing that it was improvisa-
tion made it even more humor-
ous because it seemed like he 
was just being himself. Addi-
tionally, Arnett’s over-the-top 

acting next to the cool and calm 
Lynch made each scene a joy to 
watch. 

Sometimes, the hilarity and 

absurdity of the show gets to 
the actors, and the audience is 
able to see them break charac-
ter. The first time it happened, 
as Terry Seattle covered his 
mouth to hide his laughter in a 
serious scene, I thought it was 
an editing mistake. However, 
as the show went on, it became 
a regular occurrence, with some 
characters laughing out loud 
and having to restart their sen-
tences. This is similar to bloop-
er reels on sitcoms, which can 
often be funnier than the actual 
show. 

If you are looking for a grimy, 

hard detective show like “Sher-
lock,” this is not the show for 
you. While there are definitely 
aspects of classic murder mys-
teries, like searching to find 
clues left by the murderer, it’s 
much more light-hearted, due 
in part to the show’s improvi-
sational nature. It is important 
to note that the entire show is 
not improvised; there are set 
backgrounds and scenes, and 
some jokes were a little too per-
fect. Also, some episodes were 
funnier than others, with the 
guest stars ranging from mildly 
humorous to making me laugh 
out loud. Still, “Murderville” is 
a genuinely hilarious show over-
all, and you should go watch it 
right now.

From stalking to 

harassment: 

TW: Sexual Assault, Stalking, 

Sexual Harassment, Rape 

Dear U-M Housing,
You called my being stalked, 

threatened and sexually harrased by 
my residents a “personal matter.” It is 
not. It is a hazard and a direct result 
of the unsafe job you hired me for. 

I am “Alice” from the Daily’s 

recent investigation about U-M 
Housing and ResStaff safety. Here is 
my full story. 

***

I am truly amazed I didn’t become 

another “College girl raped and 
murdered” headline that year — the 
year I was a 19 year old “Traditional 
Resident Advisor (RA)” in a freshman 
residence hall on the University of 
Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus. 

My entire first year as an RA, I 

lived in constant fear because five of 
my male residents were harassing 
and stalking me. They memorized 
my schedule and followed me around 
campus. They threatened to break 
me. They cornered and harassed 
my friend. And after I reported the 
incidents, it only got worse. I caught 
the five men watching me while I 
slept in my bedroom because U-M 
Housing refused to put locks on all 
doors to my room. They discussed 
raping me while standing directly 
outside my door. They switched into 
one of my classes to continue stalking 
me. And one night, I caught them 
under my window taking pictures 
of me. The entire time, I was ignored 
by the Division of Public Safety and 
Security, lied to by my Hall Director 
and pushed aside by U-M Housing 
administrators. 

It began on the second day of 

classes. I overheard my name spoken 
by five of my male residents living 
directly across the hall from me. They 
laughed and started talking about 
how excited they were to “break her.” 
It took me a second to realize they 
were talking about breaking me. 

The air caught in my throat. What? 

‘Break me’ how? I wanted to believe 
that the comment was innocent but 
their tone of voice said otherwise. 
I tried to voice my concerns about 
the comment to the other RAs, but 
they didn’t think the men were being 
serious about it. 

The following day, the ringleader 

of the five men came by my room 
because he needed information from 
the first floor meeting that he missed. 
As his RA, I had to act like everything 
was fine, totally normal. That is 
always your job as an RA: provide 
help for whatever the resident needs. 
After all, every resident is a customer 
to the University. We treated 
them as such, with politeness and 
unwavering hospitality. 

After I filled him in on what he 

missed, he started gloating about 
how nervous people became around 
him due to his tall, large stature. He 
said he loved seeing how nervous 
they were around him. He said 
‘people’ but it was obvious to me that 
he meant women. 

I saw the group of five men 

in places outside the dorm every 
day, which, on a campus of almost 
50,000 students, is weird. It started 
innocently enough, saying ‘hi’ to 
them outside Mason Hall or South 
Quad. 

Then, their presence became a 

pattern. I noticed at least three of 
them during many passing periods 
when I came out of my lecture halls, 
or sitting a few tables down anytime 
I was eating in any of the seven main 
dining halls on campus. 

I became increasingly nervous 

everywhere on campus and started 
spending most of my time in the 
dorm community center — every 
residence hall’s mail and package 
room — surrounded by the other 
RAs. Last year, RAs stopped working 
at community centers, thanks to 
hiring more Community Center 
Assistants (CCA). The RA contract 
(the Letter of Appointment) was 
updated accordingly for this school 
year. 

The other RAs would text me 

when the five men were in the 
community center looking for me, 
which happened multiple times each 
week. 

After a few weeks, I started getting 

creepy notes in messy handwriting 
on my door. The notes included 
poems, private details about my life 
and lines professing love for me. 
Some were signed by the residents, 
some weren’t.

I dreaded returning to my room 

because I would have to walk past the 

men’s doors — if they saw me, then I 
had to engage in nice conversation as 
they purposely said things to make 
me uncomfortable. Afterward, I 
would hear them saying “fuck her,” 
“nice ass,” or “oooh I’d like to tap 
that.” I don’t know if they knew I 
could hear them, but it stung either 
way. 

One evening, I was preparing to 

go out with friends, doing my hair 
and nails in the bathroom, when the 
ringleader knocked on my door. The 
loud knock startled me; I burnt my 
thumb on the curling iron. After a few 
moments of pause, he proceeded to 
bang on the door with what seemed 
like all his strength, and screamed 
down the hall in his frustration. I 
waited until I knew he was gone 
before running to my friends at the 
bus stop. 

The next morning, I complained 

to Eric, one of my closest RA friends, 
about the previous night’s incident. 
He advised me to update my boss 
(our hall director) about the situation, 
which I had been doing any time 
something new occurred with the 
five men. 

A few hours later, Eric called me. 

According to him, he was walking 
to the bus stop when the five men 
cornered him against a car in the 
parking lot and interrogated him. 
They would not let Eric leave until he 
said where I was.

I immediately went to my boss — I 

wanted to report to DPSS what was 
occurring. I wanted to stop the five 
men, specifically the ringleader. I 
didn’t have a specific punishment in 
mind, I just wanted DPSS to get the 
men to stop threatening my friends 
and stalking me. 

I was wary of working with DPSS. 

Officers had already ignored my 
concerns during duty rounds, and 
they had talked down to me when I 
had called for help with a multiple-
resident conflict. They were also 
rude — practically ignoring me and 
always grumbling — any time I called 
about weed odors in the hallways. 

In this instance, I figured the 

situation with the five men had 
gotten so bad that even DPSS couldn’t 
avoid helping me. I thought the 
meeting would take a while — I had 
emailed my professor telling him I 
would miss class. I told my friends I 
would be late to dinner.

An older male DPSS officer met 

me and my boss (the hall director) 
in the main office of the dorm. The 
officer was constantly checking his 
watch; it was obvious he wanted the 
meeting to be over before it had even 
started. 

The meeting took maybe ten 

minutes total, and the officer spoke 
with increasing skepticism as I 
shared my story and showed him 
texts, video recordings of the five 
men, pictures with timestamps and 
the physical notes that were left on 
my door.

The DPSS officer didn’t seem to 

think most of my information was 
relevant. At the end of the meeting, 
the officer looked at me like I just 
wasted his time and said, “Honey, it 
sounds like they have a little crush 
on you. Why don’t you just confront 
[the five men]?” I found out later, 
after reading a copy of the report, 
that he neglected to put some of the 
information I told him into the DPSS 
report. 

After this meeting, I shut down. 

My hall director had failed to stand 
up for me or try to help convince 

DPSS that this was an issue. Instead, 
the two of them agreed to have the 
officer talk to the ringleader and ask 
him to stop harassing me, because his 
behavior was “scaring me.” 

Months later, I found out that all 

DPSS did was have a two-minute 
long phone call with the ringleader. 
Apparently — according to their 
report — the ringleader was very 
apologetic.

DPSS and my hall director 

arranged for the ringleader to 
apologize to me in my room. Alone. I 
had done everything in my power to 
avoid being alone with him again, and 
now I had to let him into my private 
room because “he’d changed.” 

Unsurprising to me, his apology 

was wholly insincere, it lasted less 
than a minute and he sounded more 
amused than apologetic — I felt 
violated that he came into my room 
again. 

Later that day, I heard the five men 

laughing about me being so scared 
I called DPSS. Their conversation 
made it clear that my decision had 
validated their goal of scaring me and 
they thought it was hilarious. 

***

The dorm I lived in had an odd 

room layout. There were two access 
points in each dorm room: one door 
with a keypad lock from the hallway 
and one door from the bathroom 
with no lock. 

My dorm room and the dorm 

room next to mine were connected 
by a bathroom (Jack and Jill style) 
but there were no locks on either 
side of either bathroom door. The 
resident that I shared the bathroom 
with — and anyone in her room — 
had full access to my room through 
the bathroom. 

For the privacy of the resident I 

shared a bathroom with, I always 
kept my door to our shared bathroom 
closed. A few days after the ringleader 
apologized, I woke up from a nap to 
see both bathroom doors open. The 
five men were hanging out in my 
suitemate’s room. I got up and shut 
the bathroom door as they giggled. 
I spent the night on the floor of 
another RA’s room. 

The lack of locks was an ongoing 

issue for RAs in this dorm, as many of 
us have woken up to a resident in our 
room or later found out that a resident 
snuck into our room without our 
knowledge —I know of three other 
RAs that year who had this problem. 
When we brought our concerns to 
our hall director, we were told locks 
would be a “fire hazard.” We were 
asked not to bring it up again. 

We went to the U-M Housing 

administration and asked if they 
could help. Without a pause, their 
 

only response was, “Sorry to hear you 
feel that way.” 

I fashioned a lock for the bathroom 

door out of pipes, a bike lock cable 
and a refrigerator magnet. It looked 
ridiculous but it worked. I put a 
screwdriver under my pillow before 
I went to bed each night. Jeans with 
a belt became my pajamas. I barely 
slept.

***

One night, a friend of mine texted 

me, unprompted. He was at a party, 
wanted to hang for a bit and get a 
ride back to his place. I obliged. Once 
we got back to my dorm, I went to 
the bathroom and he started asking 
weird questions about my dating life 
and sexual history.

The questions made me nervous. 

I was about to change the subject 

when a noise made me freeze — 
the five men were walking into my 
suitemate’s room. I bolted from the 
bathroom, and my guy friend took 
that moment to grab me and kiss me. 

It was gross. He reeked of alcohol. 

I tried to push him away, but he 
grabbed me and kissed me harder. 
I could hear the five men laughing 
with my suitemate, less than fifteen 
feet from me. 

I couldn’t make a sound. I hadn’t 

been able to lock my bathroom door 
and feared the five men entering my 
room and joining if they heard what 
was happening. 

My friend raped me that night. 

I tried to tell him to stop but he just 
smirked. I stopped fighting him after 

he was inside me. I gave up, I guess. 
There wasn’t anything I could do. 

I didn’t want him to get any 

satisfaction so I closed my eyes as 
they welled with tears, determined 
not to let a single one fully form. I 
let my mind dissolve into the pain. I 
dissociated.

When he pulled up his pants, 

he kissed me on my forehead and 
asked for a ride home. His voice was 
muffled, fuzzy. I have no idea what 
else he said to me — I just got up and 
drove him home.

I broke down the second I got back 

to my dorm room. My chest felt like it 
had collapsed as I heaved and sobbed. 
Eventually I got up, took a shower 
and convinced myself I was fine. 

The next morning I went to CVS 

for Plan B. 

RAs 
are 
individuals 
with 

reporting obligations about sexual 
assault. We report to the hall director 
if something happens. The person 
who we work with every day, live in 
the same building with and who is 
in charge of us is the person we are 
contractually bound to report our 
episodes of sexual assault to. 

This is something I have never 

understood. How can you make 
a rule stating that after one of the 
most devastating things happens to 
someone, you strip them of their final 
decision: who they tell? 

I was fully aware that by talking to 

my superior, I would lose the little bit 
of power I had left over my body. 

My closest friends were the RAs 

in my building. They would have to 
report to our boss if I told them. I 
knew I couldn’t talk to my friends 
until I was ready to relive that night 
with my boss, who I distrusted 
immensely, 
and 
U-M 
Housing 

administrators, who would get a copy 
of the report my boss would write. 

***

I have held too many RAs, sobbing 

uncontrollably because their hall 
directors, DPSS and U-M Housing 
administrators won’t take their 
safety seriously. 

RA training modules, delivered 

via Canvas, centered around keeping 
the residents safe and the University 
from having to assume liability. 
Training pertaining to RA safety was 
slim to none.

I worked with many RAs by the 

end of my time in U-M Housing. The 

majority of the female ones and many 
male ones told me they had been 
harassed or assaulted by the end 
of their time on the job. Residents’ 
fathers flirt with you. Residents’ 
mothers yell at you. Residents ask you 
out, turn you into an object and, in my 
case, stalk and harass you. 

At no point do RAs receive training 

on what to do about any of this. If you 
try to tell your hall director, the first 
thing they say is that if you cannot 
handle it, maybe the job isn’t right 
for you — they constantly refer to the 
waitlist of people who want to be RAs 
and would happily take your spot. 

RAs were able to force changes 

during the Fall 2020 ResStaff strike 
because there was no waitlist. 

Nobody wanted to be an RA during 
the pandemic. Therefore, RAs were 
no longer expendable. For the first 
time, ResStaff could not be dismissed. 

***

When December began, my panic 

attacks about the rape got worse. I 
realized I needed support from my 
closest friends, the RAs. 

I went to the hall director’s 

office and asked a few hypothetical 
questions about what would happen 
if I reported the sexual assault of an 
RA. My boss said that I could simply 
issue the report, that my name could 
be left off the report, that the report 
would be a hard copy and not in the 
electronic system. It could be vague. 
And wholly anonymous.

Because of those answers, I 

decided to tell my boss about the 
rape. Sitting on a folding chair in the 
oddly colorful office, I felt incredibly 
nauseous. I eyed the trash can. 

After I finished my story, my 

hall director paused, typed on the 
computer, 
and 
turned 
around. 

“Oh whoops,” they said. “I made a 
mistake. Actually, your name will 
have to be on the report, it’ll be in the 
online system and I need a bit more 
information from you.” 

I sat in silence for a few moments. I 

felt the panic rise in my chest.

Before I could reply, my boss 

said, “So, what was his name? And, 
what type of rape was it? Vaginal 
penetration with a penis? Or anal? 
Was it just fingers?” 

I couldn’t speak. I felt my eyes 

getting red. I bit my tongue until I 
tasted blood.

“No.” I said. “I was sexually 

assaulted, that’s what you can put 
in the report. I’m not telling you any 
more. I’m not telling you who he 
was or how. And I am not talking to 
anyone else, especially DPSS.” 

I walked out, my eyes welling 

with tears as I grappled with the 
reality that I’d just exchanged the 
most vulnerable piece of information 
about myself with my boss. 

I don’t know who thought it was a 

good idea to force RAs to report their 
own sexual assaults to their bosses. It 
was the most demeaning exchange 
I’ve ever endured. 

***

My issues with the five men only 

persisted. They used nicknames to 
talk about me without sounding like 

they were referring to me. Many 
nights when I was sleeping on my 
dorm room floor, I would hear them 
outside my door, commenting on my 
body while looking at the pictures of 
me on the bulletin board. On nights 
when the boys were talking about me 
and I could escape my room, I would 
crash in another RA’s room. We 
would watch Scooby Doo, or learn 
chords on the guitar. 

In the winter semester, on the 

day before the University’s drop/add 
course deadline, I got to one of my 
classes and immediately recognized 
two new faces in the room. Two of 
the five men were sitting a few rows 
behind my normal seat. I knew this 
was no coincidence — they were 
freshmen in a lecture that did not 
even remotely coincide with their 
majors. 

I sat down and saw their faces 

reflected on my laptop screen. 
They were watching me. I do not 
remember anything from that course 
except running for the exit every 
time it ended. 

Midway through February, I had 

just gotten back to my room and 
was getting ready for bed when the 
five men stomped through the back 
stairwell. They were talking about 
me, using a nickname inspired by an 
event I had led in the dorm. 

As they passed my door, the 

ringleader 
asked 
the 
others, 

“Wouldn’t you want to rape [her] 
if you could?” The men burst out 
laughing. They walked into their 
room talking about how much they 
wanted to rape me. 

The world became fuzzy. My 

vision blacked out. I called one of the 
RAs, Leroy, and he came to my room. 
I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking so 
hard that Leroy had to grab me so I 
wouldn’t collapse. Leroy spent the 
night in my room on the floor, but 
even then I couldn’t sleep. I didn’t 
know what to do.

Previously, I had followed the 

rules and reported what happened, 
just like U-M Housing told me to. 
It only made things worse. I kept 
debating whether I should resort 
back to my hall director or DPSS. 
The memory of how little the DPSS 
officer had cared about my last report 
was still prevalent in my mind. And 
my hall director had handled me 
being raped so poorly.

Instead, my main group of RA 

friends decided to rotate walking me 
to my room each night so I wouldn’t 
be alone in my hall after dark. This 
lasted until the end of the year. 

***

When I think back on that year, 

I remember how my teeth were 
constantly chattering and my legs 
were always bouncing from anxiety 
— but I kept smiling. I wanted to 
be the best RA possible, even with 
everything happening. 

Honestly, I think I did a good job. 

Being an RA is demanding but I lived 
up to the challenge. My residents had 
problems, from depression to chronic 
illnesses, and I always tried to be 
there for them. 

I had residents sleeping in my 

room during insect infestations. I 
got take-out meals for sick residents, 
got groups of residents together 
who were struggling and planned 
outings for them, walked residents 
to University Health Services or 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services, 
pulled 
countless 
all-

nighters helping residents through 
personal problems, responded to 
their messages at all hours and 
answered 
their 
questions 
and 

concerns. 

My bulletin boards and door 

decorations were praised by U-M 
Housing administrators. I planned 
small celebrations for residents when 
they hit a big milestone: birthdays, 
half-birthdays 
(for 
summer 

birthdays), job/internship successes 
and passing hard classes.

Even though I did want to do my 

best for my residents, I also didn’t 
have a choice. As an RA, U-M housing 
can dismiss you at any moment, 
beginning or middle or end of the 
year, and you only have 48 hours to 
clear out your room and find a new 
place to live.

Bimbofication is a revolutionary act

Have you seen the bimbofication meme? 

In most iterations, it depicts a woman in 
plain clothes holding a book and quizzically 
flipping through its pages. She then begins to 
stretch the book farther away from herself, 
and over time, becoming more scantily 
clad, drops the volume on the ground. Long 
blonde tresses, fuck-me shoes and a pink 
bodycon mini dress adorn her bodacious, 
fake-tanned figure. This transformation is 
bimbofication. A woman turning her back 
on scholarly material, on knowledge, on 
cognizance, is bimbofication. 

If you haven’t seen it yet, here’s a popular 

image of it:

***

When I think back to my first encounters 

with the word “feminism,” I think of the 
19th Amendment that gave all women 
— in practice, only white women — the 
right to vote in America. This was my first 
encounter with the fact that women have 
been marginalized throughout history and 
that there was, and still is, an ongoing fight 
for liberation.

Feminism has evolved in many ways 

since its first wave at the end of the 19th 
century, when it centered around the role 
of women in a rapidly industrializing world. 
Though it was first created to uplift only 
white, wealthy women, there are now waves 
of feminism that include, and even focus on, 
sex workers, trans women and women of 
color. In the fight toward total and equitable 
women’s liberation, we still have a long way 
to go. And unfortunately, misconstruing the 
term “feminism” has led to many setbacks in 
the furthering of women’s equality around 
the world. 

In recent history, feminism hasn’t exactly 

centered on uplifting all women of all walks 
of life. Baby boomers sought to advance the 
rights of women through corporate means. 
“Breaking the glass ceiling,” so to speak, was 
understood to be the ultimate achievement 
of a woman in a man’s world, hustling in 
corporate America alongside her male 
colleagues.

This so-called feminist rhetoric, in turn, 

demeaned women who chose to be stay-
at-home moms and women who never had 

access to a high-powered career in the first 
place. Intersections of race, class, sexuality 
and other identities were cast to the wayside 
as women with privilege were empowered 
to rise to the top of the Fortune 500. Think: 
rich white woman in a power suit, Sheryl 
Sandberg’s “Lean In.” This iteration of 
feminism was completely blind to realities 
of inaccessibility, systemic racism and 
inequitable opportunities, and it remained 
complicit in the very systems that generate 
sexism: capitalism, the patriarchy and so on.

Once this ideation of feminism was 

introduced to the internet, we were gifted 
with the #GIRLBOSS trend. This was 
the ‘glass ceiling feminism’ reparceled for 
millennial consumption. Still completely 
corporate, the #GIRLBOSS movement 
praised women for their economic output 
and disregarded the immense privilege of 
crafting a go-getter mindset in a high-level 
workplace. 

#GIRLBOSS was taken from the title of 

Sophia Amoruso’s autobiography, in which 
she tells the origin story of her fashion brand 
Nasty Gal. The term is deeply rooted in the 
notion of putting work above all else, and 
stopping at nothing to garner career success. 
Nowadays, the term is insulting, often 
existing as a “personification of tokenism 
and unhealthy attitudes” in the workplace.

It is especially tone deaf when we 

recognize the barriers women of color and 
trans women face when entering corporate 
America. While #GIRLBOSS may have 
begun as an empowering appreciation 
of a woman’s financial independence, it 
oozes with the same lackluster ideals of the 
corporate feminism before it, reinforcing 
the value of women solely based on 
their contributions to the economy and 
overlooking the non-inclusive, ignorant 
notion that all women have a chance to 
succeed in the workplace. 

Flash forward to one of feminism’s newest 

iterations now: full of post-irony with regard 
to the #GIRLBOSS era that came shortly 
before it. With the resurgence of Paris 
Hilton’s popularity in online culture, the 
pink aesthetic of the early 2000s has been 
combined with the workings of 21st-century 
feminism to birth bimbofication. The 
bimbofication meme became a way to cope 
with the emergence of a new form of passive 
feminism: dissociative feminism.

Dissociative feminism, a term coined by 

Emmeline Clein of Buzzfeed, refers to the 
use of deadpan, nihilistic humor to cope 
with reductive ideas of womanhood. It is a 
form of feminism with no real outcome or 
imprint. To rephrase, dissociative feminism 

signifies an understanding that women will 
always remain marginalized. Instead of 
working to diminish sexism, a dissociative 
feminist would rather make fun of their 
marginalized condition and accept it as the 
only possible outcome.

In Clein’s article, she cites the British 

television series “Fleabag” as the catalyst of 
this moment in feminism. The dissociative 
feminist “medicates through sex, alcohol, 
and inflicting pain on others.” As a coping 
strategy, dissociative feminism captures 
the damsel in distress through a different 
perspective, wherein the damsel flocks to 
her distress. 

The problem with this recent iteration of 

feminism is this: engaging in dissociative 
feminism means staying complicit in 
heteropatriarchal 
colonial 
institutions 

— like European beauty standards and 
the wage gap — and believing that the 
acknowledgement of women’s struggle is 
as good as taking action. The bimbofication 
process descends from this brand of 
feminism, retreating to the subservient, 
frivolous role that has been imposed 
on women for much of history. The 
oversexualization of the female body and 
the depiction of women as unintelligent — 
with the woman abandoning her book in 
favor of a pink clutch — is a harmful ploy to 
reinforce heteropatriarchy.

However, 
by 
overdoing 
this 
self-

degradation in an intentionally artificial 
way, bimbofication works beyond the 
passivity of dissociative feminism, with a 
subversion of the once-harmful stereotypes 
of women who love pink and are often half-
clothed.

To self-bimbofy means not only feeding 

into gender norms, but also embracing and 
simultaneously subverting them. Yes, the 
stereotype of a dumb, curvy blonde woman 
is exhausted and degrading. But to look and 
act like this as a conscious choice is a form 
of resistance. If someone calls me a bimbo 
and I embrace it as a compliment, I am 
stripping the insult of its power. Choosing 
to be perceived like this is a revolutionary 
act against sexist rhetoric because it renders 
this language useless in keeping women 
down.

Bimbofication 
reflects 
this 
passive 

approach to feminism, but in a way that 
illustrates the complex humor-mechanisms 
that Gen Z uses to resist larger structures. 
Instead of bottling up our experiences of 
sexism and letting them ruin our lives, 
bimbofication lets women show the world 
what it has wanted from us all along. To 
actively choose to play into the stereotypes 

of women is a post-ironic game. Women are 
told that we are dumb and useless. When 
we display these traits in a gratuitous way, 
it is a secret that only the bimbofied can 
understand. 

Bimbofication is a profoundly subversive 

act that revolutionizes the idea of a 
woman’s choice. In it, we can choose to defy 
corporate feminism, which tells us that a 
woman’s purpose is to expand the economy 
as efficiently as her male counterpart does. 
We can play dumb as a way of being less 
productive, because we understand that 
productivity is not everything. 

Bimbofication is also a challenge to 

misogyny, which holds that women should 
dress modestly and be subservient to 
men. As a way of breaking these molds, 
bimbofication enables women to reclaim 
the degrading rhetoric characteristic of the 
patriarchy. Think of the boys who bullied 
you in elementary school, claiming that your 
pink clothes must denote your weakness 
and that you must be bad at math since 
you’re a girl.

Bimbofication is the post-ironic response 

to larger issues of misogyny and sexism, 
empowering women to let the world think 
of them as stupid and vain. Transposing 
onto reality, bimbofication takes the shape 
of many influencers on TikTok, Instagram 
and other social sites, namely, Chrissy 
Chlapecka.

Chrissy Chlapecka — a 21-year-old 

Barbie-like blonde from Chicago — is at the 
forefront of this movement. Across social 
media, she is an explosion of sparkles and 
pink. Most of her content focalizes her 
queer identity and being true to her own 
story, which she shares to her followers in 
her vocal-fried, nasally pitch. She also posts 

silly videos that make sense only to those 
who’ve had hyper-feminized experiences, 
like getting an ear piercing at Claire’s.

Beyond her comedic presence, she is a 

source of positivity and confidence for her 
more than 4 million TikTok followers. In a 
recent interview with the Chicago Tribune, 
Chlapecka explains that her hope is to be 
an “older sister” for her viewers who, like 
herself, did not always hear messages of 
being unapologetic and genuine. This is the 
true power that bimbofication can harness. 

However, like most internet offspring, 

the meme does not come without its 
faults. It is a white European approach to 
reclaiming one’s own body that reflects 
immense privilege, especially when the 
right to bodily autonomy has been stolen 
from many women around the world. And, 
not all women who may choose to partake 
in bimbofication feel safe doing so. 

Moreover, 
when 
much 
of 
the 

bimbofication 
aesthetic 
originates 

from underground queer communities, 
the meme’s ‘camp’ approach could be 
interpreted as an appropriation of queer 
culture. 
Though 
somewhat 
hard 
to 

define, camp is mainly an appreciation for 
intentional artifice and fakeness, centering 
subjects that are, “deliciously over-the-top, 
tongue-in-cheek, in earnestness or in jest; 
they breathe parody and irony.” Historically, 
participating in the camp aestheitc has 
provided a, “way for queer people…to 
connect in solidarity and survive injustice 
with humor.” 

MARTHA STARKEL

Statement Columnist

Last week, while in a hurry to get to 

a meeting across campus, I was laser 
focused only on the quick cadence of my 
steps. However, as I passed by two people 
in conversation, my attention diverted to 
the sound of one of their voices. The man 
appeared to be South Asian, and his voice 
was rich, thick and saturated with my own 
father’s accent. Immediately, I felt a wave of 
comfort wash over me despite my continued 
mad steps toward my meeting place. 

Since coming to the University of 

Michigan, 
a 
predominantly 
white 

institution, I have found myself missing the 
familiarity that comes from my parents’ 
Indian accents. Although I also attended a 
predominantly white high school, my home 
was a designated space for my family’s 
ethnic background to flourish. My parents’ 
distinct accents were synonymous with the 
warm and welcoming definition of ‘home’ 
they cultivated for me. 

However, on campus, there is not 

a similar place for me to retreat to. 
While nearly 15% of the University’s 
undergraduate population is international, 
with one of the biggest communities being 
Indian, I’ve observed a disconnect between 
native-born and international students. I 

don’t see the two groups mixing often, and 
that might partially be because of the way 
people with ethnic accents are othered in 
ways extending far beyond campus. It’s a 
prejudice that is most clearly evident within 
popular media. 

Indian characters in television are often 

comedically portrayed, with the punchline 
of the joke resting on their foreign accent. 
Caricatured figures like Raj Koothrappali 
from “The Big Bang Theory,” Ravi Ross from 
“Jessie,” and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon 
from “The Simpsons” are all male, awkward 
and speak with a thick Indian accent. And, 
while their characters speak as though they 
are directly from South Asia — or rather 
a misconstrued, stereotypical version of 
South Asia — on television, each of the 
actors speak with an American accent in 
real life.

If you closed your eyes and listened 

purely to the sound of the actors’ voices, 
they would be indistinguishable from their 
white American counterparts. In fact, Apu 
was formally voiced by actor Hank Azaria: 
a white man with no connection to South 
Asian culture, who later stepped down 
from the role due to his perpetuation of 
harmful stereotypes.

Moreover, the vast majority of these male 

South Asian characters — at least those 
with an accent — tend to be socially inept. 
They focus only on school, can’t find any 

romantic partners, have limited numbers 
of friends, are painfully blunt and don’t 
understand any American idioms — all 
characteristics that make them the butt of 
jokes. Any time I am introduced to such a 
character on television, I hold my breath, 
waiting for the moment someone makes fun 
of the character’s mode of speaking.

Take, for example, this scene from “The 

Office.” The main character, Michael 
Scott, feigns an Indian accent while 
pretending to work at a convenience store 
— depicting a long-held television trope. 
While mimicking the accent, Scott uses 
incomplete sentences to communicate, 
thus insinuating that all foreigners are 
poor English speakers and/or unable to 
hold conversation. Although this scene 
ultimately ends with an Indian-American 
slapping Scott, revealing the unacceptable 
nature of his mockery, the damage is done: 
reductive television stereotypes against 
South Asian men persist.

It 
is 
this 
harmful 
representation 

that makes me worried about others’ 
perceptions of my own family. My father 
speaks with a strong Indian accent, but 
he is a complex and interesting man. And, 
the fact that I feel the need to preface 
this assertion with “but” shows just how 
deeply rooted the stereotype is. My dad 
loves talking about history and politics, is 
a walking encyclopedia of idioms and gives 
exceptional advice. And yet, mainstream 
television 
never 
demonstrates 
these 

qualities. It only depicts the harmful, 
hyperbolic versions of South Asians — 
particularly South Asian men — that appeal 
to a white audience’s humor.

When speaking about Apu’s comedic 

contribution to “The Simpsons,” show 
co-producer and writer Dana Gould stated, 
“There are accents that by their nature to 
white Americans sound funny. Period.” 
Americans are afforded the luxury of 
finding light-hearted humor in ethnic 
accents, while these jokes serve as the 
foundation on which America’s ethnically-
targeted bigotry is built. Long before I had 
the language to express such injustice, I 
experienced this bigotry in the forms of 
shame and otherness.

As a child, I would feel ashamed to 

translate my father’s accented English 
to my non-accented English. Once while 
shopping in Walmart, my father and I spent 
20 minutes wandering through the store, 
asking store associates where the flowers 
were. We were repeatedly directed to the 
baking aisle, where the flour was. When my 
father shook his head, explaining that what 
we were looking for wasn’t in the baking 
aisle, we were met only with shrugs and 
confused faces. It wasn’t until my 7-year-old 
self asked that we got the answer we were 
looking for. 

The store associates’ confusion came 

from an innocent and genuine uncertainty 
of what my father was saying. But, despite 
living in the United States for my whole 
life, and despite my father’s American 
citizenship, I still feared that they viewed 
us as outsiders unworthy of our stay 
here. Their nonchalant attitude toward 
understanding what we wanted reinforced 
my idea that we were a mere nuisance. 

I 
experienced 
this 
same 
worry 
throughout 

my childhood, scared that my friends’ well-
spoken parents would judge my father 
for his way of speaking. Though I never 
experienced any bigotry from my friends 
or their families, I was concerned that my 
father’s stuttering or mispronunciation of 
words would categorize him as the cliche 
‘awkward Indian.’ After all, all of the media 
I was consuming told me that Indians’ 
accents immediately reduce them to one-
dimensional, laugh-worthy characters. 

During my brother’s college graduation, 

as my family and I watched my brother 
line up alongside his peers, we all felt sheer 
excitement. Seeing him before the stage on 
which he was about to receive his diploma, 
my dad proudly shouted his name — Akhil 
— to get his attention for a photograph. In 
response, a white graduate standing near 
parroted “Akhil! Akhil! Look here,” with 
an artificially thick and inaccurate Indian 
accent.

What was supposed to be a joyous and 

innocent moment quickly turned into one 
of shame and embarrassment. My father’s 
voice taught me multiplication tables at our 
kitchen table, guided me through the task 
of riding a bike and cheered for me during 
high school sports games. And now it was 

being mocked in front of an entire crowd of 
people.

Despite the loving nature of his voice, my 

father’s accent is the recipient of vehement 
hate and prejudice — treatment that is 
wholly unjust and racially-motivated. As 
a culture, we’re socialized to celebrate 
British and Australian accents, touting 
them as sexy. The difference between 
these two groups of accents? One is native 
to predominantly white countries and the 
other is native to predominantly non-white 
countries.

This bias, like most other racial 

biases, stems from colonialism. British 
accents belonged to those of the ruling 
class and Indian accents belonged to the 
subordinated class. While these power 
structures may have dissipated on a formal 
level, the power imbalance remains, woven 
into our country’s socio-political fabric. 
Social hierarchies, perpetuated by popular 
media, continue to treat ethnic minorities 
as second-class citizens. Or, in this case, as 
clowns that exist not as three-dimensional, 
dynamic American citizens but as the 
source of a cheap laugh.

Hearing the ethnic accent native to one’s 

motherland can feel like a warm embrace. 
To others, it is a symbol of unwanted foreign 
encroachment. If mainstream television 
perpetuates the idea that all Indian men 
with accents are awkward or inherently 
the ‘other’, the viewers will internalize the 
message and believe it to be true.

While this was once a painful point 

for me — causing me to be ashamed of 
my Indian family’s mode of speaking — I 
have found so much value in the richness 
of the accent. It doesn’t have to just be an 
opportunity for people to target and express 
their prejudiced views. It is a reminder of 
home and family.

And, while I no longer feel the 

embarrassment I once did with regard to 
my father’s accent, I still get nervous about 
offhand comments. I feel a need to protect 
him from the bigotry, but I feel powerless to 
do so. Ultimately, it is the media that shapes 
people’s thoughts and opinions. Only once it 
accurately depicts the wide range of Indian 
men’s personalities and interests will 
people understand the truth.

All life experiences are bina-

ry; they are either expected or 
unexpected. You are familiar 
with most of your daily rou-
tine, starting with waking up. 
What you do for the rest of 
your day is up to you. Maybe 
you decide to get out of bed. 
Maybe you choose to shower 
and get ready for the rest of 
your day. Maybe you visit your 
favorite coffee shop for break-
fast, or maybe you don’t. But 
no matter what you choose, 
you expect the outcome of 
your choice and at the end of 
the day, you close your eyes, 
you fall asleep and you repeat 
it all over again. 

Now look, I’m not saying 

this to be morbid. I think it 
is important to create consis-
tent habits, and repetition is 

comforting. I love my morning 
routines. I love the comfort of 
walking over the same bridge 
to get to class each morning. 
I love my daily calls home to 
my family, and I love order-
ing from my favorite restau-
rant once a week. I love all 
these things because I know 
what to expect. But what hap-
pens when you experience the 
unexpected?

You are probably thinking, 

I experience new things all 
the time, it’s not that special. 
I don’t mean new. With new 
things, we can often anticipate 
what the experience feels like 
or recall past memories to help 
our mind fill in the holes of 
what just occurred. I’m talk-
ing about the rare “hold my 
breath, what just happened” 
unexpected — the type of feel-
ing that leaves your brain per-
plexed and mouth speechless.

I can only remember a few 

moments in my life when I’ve 
felt like this, one of them being 
when I witnessed my first 

total solar eclipse in 2017.

When my dad first told me 

we were going to drive over 
eight hours from the south of 
San Francisco all the way to 

northern Oregon just to look 
at the sky for a few minutes, 
I thought he was crazy. Why 

would someone drive for eight 
hours just to look at the moon? 
I told him that we could wit-
ness the moon cover roughly 
85% of the sun from home and 

that it would be 85% as fasci-
nating — I would quickly learn 
to eat my words.

The thing about total solar 

eclipses is that you can see 
totality, which is when the 
moon completely covers the 
sun. Only if you are within the 
path of totality, which is the 
small strip of area where the 
moon’s shadow blankets the 
Earth’s surface. The further 
from the center of the path, 
the less the moon covers the 
sun and the shorter the time 
that you experience totality. 
So we could have stayed home, 
but we would have only wit-
nessed a partial solar eclipse, 
not a total solar eclipse — two 
completely different phenom-
enons.

After the lengthy drive, my 

dad, brother and I arrived in 
Madras, a small town in Ore-
gon with a population of over 
seven thousand people. By the 
time we arrived, tens of thou-
sands of people, who’d trav-
eled from all corners of the 
world, had already flooded 
the ill-prepared town. Since 
Madras has the lowest chance 
of cloud coverage, people from 
over 39 different countries and 
all 50 states flocked to Solar-
town, 
Madras’s 
makeshift 

campsite, for the weekend. 
Even Oregon’s National Guard 
was called in to mitigate traf-
fic. I was stunned. People had 
been living out of their cars for 
days, setting up tents and tele-
scopes. It gave off an almost 
cult-like atmosphere: as if it 
were Judgment Day and this 
was the final hurrah. As time 
passed, the anticipation grew. 

“Two 
hours,” 
yelled 
the 

crowd. “One hour! Ten min-
utes!! It’s starting!!!” Finally.

First contact: the invisible 

moon kisses the tip of the sun. 
If you are not wearing the spe-
cial shades that block all visi-
ble light, you can hardly notice 
the gradual bites the moon has 
taken out of the star. Now, it’s 
just a waiting game. Roughly 
ten minutes before full cover-
age, the world is enveloped in 
gray twilight. As time slowly 
progresses 
toward 
totality, 

you notice the diamond ring 
effect, where only a portion of 
the sun resembling a diamond 

ring remains. Five seconds 
before totality, you notice Bai-
ly’s beads, in which tiny balls 
of light surround the rim of 
the moon. It is almost time. A 
shadow washes over our world 
as if God has thrown a blanket 
over us.

And then it hits. Second con-

tact: totality. The moon has 
completely covered the sun, 
and all that is left is its corona, 
the outermost part of the sun’s 
atmosphere which is typically 
masked by the sun’s rays. You 
throw off your glasses, and 
at this moment, life is trans-
formed. The world changes 
from light to dark, from hot 
to cold and from anxious to 
calm. The deadness of your 
surroundings flows through 
your body. You hear nothing 
but animals shouting in confu-
sion, as your senses overload. 
You are entranced and noth-
ing matters, not even time: 
minutes pass but they feel like 
seconds. And then it’s finished 
and you want more.

Third Contact: the sun slow-

ly reappears. Your soul comes 
back to life and you become 
aware of your surroundings. 
Putting the shades back on, 
you see the diamond ring 
effect and Baily’s beads again. 
You wave goodbye to the expe-
rience and pray that you will 
see another once more.

Fourth Contact: the sun 

is now free and cheers ring 
out from the crowd. You look 
around and people are still 
looking up at the sky to pro-
cess what they have just wit-
nessed. Some people are still 
in awe, others have looks of 
confusion and a few are wiping 
away tears they didn’t know 
they had.

I fall into the first cate-

gory. The experience was so 
enthralling that we traveled to 
Chile a few years later just to 
get a glimpse of totality again. 
While I could expect what it 
would feel like then, no one 
could have prepared me for 
my first eclipse. As the next 
total solar eclipse visible from 
North America will occur on 
April 8, 2024, you already 
know that I have plans to see 
it. But until then, I’ll have to 
wait.

On belonging in college: observations of a Muslim woman

Design by Reid Graham

YASMINE ELKHARSSA

MiC Columnist

“Who ‘belongs’ in college, 

and who feels like they 

belong?”

“I found the way she phrased this 
striking — why couldn’t she say 
Muslims, and those perceived as 
Muslim, when it was so obvious 
that that is what she meant? ”

“Currently, there are still 
many universities that 
practice Christian values 
in their curriculum and on 

campus; however, many public 
institutions have strayed away 


welcoming students of all 

religious backgrounds to their 

campuses. ”

“Although the University is not 
an exception, these examples 
provide insight to the barriers 
that Muslim students face when 

feeling a sense of belonging 

at predominantly white 

institutions.”

“While higher education has 
become more religiously and 

racially diverse, it still raises the 
question: Do I really belong?”

hen the Board of Regents 
fired former University 
of Michigan President 

Mark Schlissel, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board was focused on the 
regents themselves. The regents — 
who serve unpaid for eight-year terms 
and are elected by Michigan residents 
— approve the yearly budget, appoint 
the president, oversee the University’s 
$17 billion endowment and regulate 
all three U-M campuses through the 
Regents’ Ordinance. They answer to 
Michigan voters, not the University 
community. How can the regents 
meet the needs of students, faculty 
and staff when those groups have 
little to no control over the board’s 
membership, and when regency itself 
is only a voluntary, part-time position?

The board has clearly made 

mistakes with its power, particularly 
in the last couple of years. In the 
words of the Editorial Board, “many 
of the trademark bad decisions made 
by Schlissel were directed, or at least 
directly influenced, by the board 
(of regents).” The regents’ decision 
to reopen student housing in the 
fall of 2020 is specifically cited. In 
the same month, the regents failed 
to 
temper 
the 
administration’s 

aggressive response to the GEO strike 
or act on the Faculty Senate’s historic 
vote of no-confidence on Schlissel. 
One University’s fight to provide 
the Flint and Dearborn campuses 
with equitable resources also faces 
resistance from the regents. More 
recently, the regents didn’t stop 
Schlissel from returning to campus 
as a tenured professor — despite an 
ongoing investigation into his actions. 
And, as the Editorial Board points 
out, the regents have also historically 
failed to address sexual misconduct 
throughout the University with any 
sort of vigor.

The regents were also criticized 

for raising tuition in the summer of 
both 2020, where it failed the first 
time it was proposed, and 2021. Each 
increase added just under $300 to 
in-state tuition and nearly $1,000 
to out-of-state tuition. Financial aid 
awards were increased for low and 
middle-income 
in-state 
students, 

so many, myself included, weren’t 
impacted by the increase. Additional 

aid was not awarded to out-of-state 
students, who already paid the 
highest out-of-state tuition of any 
public university in the country.

Despite their importance to the 

University as a whole — out-of-state 
students make up nearly half of all 
undergraduate students and their 
experiences and ideas are invaluable 
to the growth of in-state students 
— out-of-state students suffered the 
brunt of recent tuition increases 
engineered by a board they have 
no say in electing. In fact, they have 
no say over how the University’s 
highest authority handles any of 
the controversial issues impacting 
students. Moreover, because the 
board 
appoints 
the 
president, 

and the president fills most high 
administrative positions, out-of-state 
students’ lack of input extends to the 
entire University administration.

Representation is only marginally 

better for in-state students and 
staff because they share electoral 
responsibilities with millions of 
other voters, most of whom have 
no vested interest in the University. 
The fact that University voices are 
drowned out was evident after the 
2020 election, when former Regent 
Shauna Ryder-Diggs (D), one of two 
regents to oppose the 2020 tuition 
increase, narrowly lost reelection to 
current Regent Sarah Hubbard (R). 
Even by acting clearly in the interest 
of students, Ryder-Diggs was not able 
to keep her seat. 

Because the average Michigan 

voter 
isn’t 
involved 
with 
the 

University, 
and 
because 
down-

ballot races often draw careless 
decision-making, the board has 
become dominated by powerful, 
recognizable figures. Regent Denise 
Ilitch (D) is the daughter of the late 
Mike Illich, the founder of Little 
Caesars Pizza and owner of Detroit’s 
baseball and hockey teams. Regents 
Mark Bernstein (D), Jordan Acker 
(D) and Michael Behm (D) each 
come from prominent family law 
firms (Bernstein’s commercials have 
plagued my television my entire life). 
And, of course, Regent Ron Weiser, 
famous in part for calling Michigan’s 
top three state officials “witches,” is 
Chair of the Michigan Republican 
Party and a large Ann Arbor property 
owner.

The board members, who all have 

obligations elsewhere, aren’t paid 

either. That has two implications: the 
University will always come second 
to the regents’ paid obligations, and 
those without ample resources might 
not be able to serve on the board at all. 
The decision to bring students back 
to campus in fall 2020, for example, 
was allegedly influenced by Weiser’s 
extensive property interests. He went 
as far as donating $30 million to the 
University days before it announced 
it would reopen. All told, the board’s 
mistakes are due in part to regency’s 
part-time 
nature 
and 
because 

those affected are, at best, weakly 
represented. 

The board has taken an important 

step by including students, faculty 
and staff in the Presidential Search 
Committee. Even then, University 
stakeholders shouldn’t have to rely 
on the board’s generosity to have 
representation. 
Changing 
how 

regents are chosen so that all relevant 
University stakeholders are always 
represented — while maintaining 
the centuries-old relationship the 
University 
has 
with 
Michigan 

voters — is the best way to tackle 
the University’s ongoing struggles. 
Current graduate and undergraduate 
students, members of the Faculty 
Senate and other University staff 
(including 
lecturers, 
MHousing 

and MDining employees and other 
support staff) should each be allowed 
to elect one regent. Terms should also 
be limited to two years instead of 
eight, encouraging the board to evolve 
with the campus population — or face 
a challenging reelection fight.

For the 2022 fiscal year, student 

tuition will account for $1.8 billion of 
the University’s budget, far more than 
the $322 million Michigan taxpayers 
will contribute. The University’s 
world-class faculty is critical not 
only to our institution’s prestige but 
to its ability to bring innovation to 
Michigan as a whole. And, of course, 
without additional staff, the entire 
campus would quickly grind to a 
halt. These three groups make major 
contributions to the University and 
as employees and attendees are most 
intimately impacted by the board’s 
decisions. It stands to reason that 
they should be allowed to directly 
pick at least a minority of the board’s 
members. 

The Board of Regents doesn’t represent 
UMich stakeholders; it’s time they do

F

ormer 
Miami 
Dolphins 

coach 
Brian 
Flores 

announced Feb. 1 that he had 

filed a class-action lawsuit against 
the NFL and three of its teams. He 
alleged racial discrimination in 
league hiring practices as well as 
tanking — a practice by which teams 
intentionally lose to amass greater 
draft capital, among other charges. 
Flores’s lawsuit calls into question 
the legitimacy of the “Rooney Rule,” 
which requires all NFL teams to 
interview at least two external 
minority candidates for coaching 
and general manager vacancies.

Flores, however, is essentially 

calling the rule a sham. He claims 
that multiple teams engaged him 
in sham interviews meant only to 
satisfy the Rooney Rule, and he 
was not a serious candidate for 
those jobs. He brought receipts; 
the lawsuit contained screenshots 
of a text exchange between Flores 
and Patriots coach Bill Belichick, 
whom Flores worked for in New 
England before taking the Dolphins’ 
job. Belichick evidently believed he 
was texting his current offensive 
coordinator, 
Brian 
Daboll, 
to 

congratulate him on being hired as 

coach of the New York Giants. But 
the text went to Flores, who was 
set to interview for the Giants’ job 
himself three days later. Flores did 
have his interview as scheduled, 
and shortly thereafter the Giants 
introduced their new coach: Brian 
Daboll.

Flores’s claims come with instant 

credibility, both because of the state 
of racial representation in the league 
and because of Flores’s stature 
as a coach. There are only three 
active black coaches in the NFL — 
Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mike Tomlin; 
the Dolphins’ new coach, Mike 
McDaniel; and Lovie Smith with the 
Houston Texans — after Flores and 
Texans coach David Culley were 
fired after this season. That alone is 
a pretty bad look for the league, but 
context makes it worse. The Texans 
have a longstanding reputation 
of institutional racism and those 
allegations have been repeatedly 
substantiated.

Late Texans owner Bob McNair 

even faced severe backlash from his 
own players for racist comments he 
made in 2017. Racism seems to be 
hereditary in the McNair family. Bob 
McNair’s son Cal, current owner of 
the team, is no stranger to racially 
charged controversy himself, and 
recent rumors have been swirling 
that Houston was dead-set on hiring 

former NFL quarterback Josh 
McCown as coach. They didn’t, but 
the fact that they were considering a 
white man in his early 40s with no 
coaching experience with people 
like Flores out there is indicative of 
the larger problem, even if McCown 
wasn’t ultimately hired. 

Flores’s 
lawyers, 
justifiably, 

accused McNair of only hiring 
Smith to thwart allegations of 
institutional racism in light of the 
class-action 
suit. 
ESPN’s 
NFL 

Insider Adam Schefter chimed in 
as well, saying “I think (Flores’s 
lawsuit) changed this (NFL coach-
hiring) cycle,” on the network’s 
Super Bowl LVI “SportsCenter” 
special on Feb 9. “I think the 
Texans were tracking — tracking 
— to hire Josh McCown, and the 
environment 
and 
atmosphere 

changed once that lawsuit was 
filed. And I think it would’ve been 
very difficult for them to hire a guy 
they, I think, were very interested 
in, and they ended up hiring Lovie 
Smith instead.” Given the way 
the McNair family has spoken — 
publicly — about minorities, it’s hard 
to disagree with Flores’s lawyers 
here. From the outside, it looks like 
they’re racists using Culley and now 
Smith as pawns to try to throw fans 
off the scent.

Tomlin is the league’s longest-

tenured coach, and he coaches the 
franchise owned by the Rooney 
family, the namesake of the Rooney 
Rule. None of that is to say Tomlin’s 
continued presence in Pittsburgh 
is due to his race. He has long been 
an elite NFL coach, and the Steelers 
would be universally ridiculed for 
firing him. Having said that, Flores 
had begun to establish himself as an 
elite coach as well, and his firing by 
the Dolphins this offseason came 
as a massive shock both within the 
league and in the media. He was 
known as one of the league’s most 
popular coaches within his own 
locker room, and is often spoken of 
as the epitome of a “player’s coach.” 
Flores led the Dolphins to their first 
back-to-back winning seasons since 
2002 and 2003, and had restored 
hope to one of the league’s most 
success-starved franchises. 

Flores’s status as a rising star — 

one who was already producing 
winning seasons after taking over a 
franchise mired in two decades of 
complete and utter irrelevance — is 
significant. If Flores was a first-time 
coach who was fired with a record 
7-10 games under .500, you could 
argue that he was just a sore loser 
seeking to capitalize on America’s 
racial tensions. But Flores led one 
of the league’s most perennially 
embarrassing 
franchises 
to 
a 

24-25 record in three seasons, 
including 19-13 the last two seasons. 
Whether Flores’s firing and/or his 
interview experiences were racially 
influenced remains to be seen, but 
firing him was so objectively stupid 
that you almost have to wonder 
whether the decision may not have 
been entirely football-related. With 
the league’s record on race, from 
blackballing Colin Kaepernick to the 
conspicuous snubbing of qualified 
black candidates, all of this is enough 
to raise an eyebrow or two. 

That last point isn’t some kind 

of abstract conjecture. There are 
multiple 
well-known 
African-

American coordinators who should 
be coaches right now, and their lack 
of opportunities is glaring. Schefter 
noted later in the “SportsCenter” 
special that the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 
new defensive coordinator has 
interviewed for 10 coaching jobs, 
and hasn’t gotten one of them. 
Teryl Austin is a respected and 
experienced coach who is clearly 
worthy of a chance to lead an 
organization. Is it that much of a 
reach to say anybody who’s been 
asked to interview 10 times for a 
coaching job is probably qualified 
for one? Eric Bieniemy, the offensive 
coordinator for the Kansas City 
Chiefs, has overseen one of the 
most prolific offenses of all time, 

with two Super Bowl appearances 
and one championship to his name. 
He has interviewed for multiple 
vacancies over multiple years. He’s 
still a coordinator. Bieniemy and 
Flores were passed over for the New 
Orleans Saints job, too. New Orleans 
chose to promote from within 
earlier this month, going with their 
defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen.

That seems sensible on its 

face — to maintain stability in an 
organization which just lost its 
legendary longtime coach in Sean 
Payton. After all, Allen had been 
with the organization since 2015; 
has coaching experience, like Flores 
but unlike Bieniemy; and was seen 
as Payton’s right-hand man in recent 
years. That sounds great on paper, 
but Allen was 8-28 with zero playoff 
appearances in three years as coach 
of the Raiders. He gets another 
chance in the big chair before Flores, 
who’s had more recent (and far more 
successful) coaching experience? 
He gets the nod over Bieniemy, the 
architect of Patrick Mahomes’s 
development into an all-time great 
quarterback? Bieniemy and Flores 
were passed over for a job that they 
were both more qualified for than

he 
stereotype 
of 

the 
“iPad 
baby” 
has 

become one of the most 

detestable 
and 
looked-down-

upon images in recent history. 
We as a society tend to look on in 
disgust at the parents of sticky-
handed, 
wide-eyed 
children 

at restaurants, their toddler 
connected mind, body and soul 
to their overly screen-protected 
and intensely loud iPad as you 
try to enjoy dinner with your 
family. Whether it be the catchy 
songs of “CoComelon” or the 
bright-colored pictures and toys 
of the YouTube channel “Ryan’s 
World,” toddlers of this day and 
age are seemingly obsessed with 
technology. They just can’t seem 
to take their eyes (and hands, and 
mouths) off of it. 

Sure, members of Generation Z 

are met with similar arguments, 
whether it be complaints that we 
are “always on Insta-space-ta-
gram” (one of my dad’s personal 
favorites), or that one day we 
will eventually lose our eyesight 
from the perpetual blue light or 
get “tech” or “text” neck. These 
comments don’t scare us, and 
we continue to text, tweet and 
post because it’s what we know. 
We have grown up in the age of 
social media, and it is our way 
to communicate our thoughts 
and express ourselves. But, as 
opposed to the toddlers of this 
generation, we grew up reading 
picture books for fun, watching 
“Dora the Explorer” in the 
comfort of our own homes and 
coloring on the paper placemats 
at 
restaurants 
with 
chunky 

crayons: there were no iPads in 
sight. 

I don’t mean to sound like a 

total “well, back in my day…” 
kind of person, but, yeah, “back 
in my day” (meaning, of course, 
the late 2000s and early 2010s), 
we didn’t bring technology to the 
table. Growing up, my first access 
to technology was my green iPod 
Shuffle, which I shared with 
my sister, and it solely played 
the soundtrack to High School 
Musical. I would have never 

thought to use it at family times 
because, honestly, things felt 
different about technology back 
then, in the early childhood of 
Generation Z. At that moment 
in my personal and emotional 
development, I was not reliant on 
technology as a form of comfort 
or entertainment. 

With this having been said, 

going through the last two years 
of a global pandemic has possibly 
changed 
my 
perspective 
on 

the phenomena of this elusive 
“iPad baby,” and this constant 
dependency on media. Now, 
I may even understand the 
placative qualities that this huge 
screen provides to its user, and 
empathize with the cause.

The pandemic has brought 

many of us back to old pleasures 
we may have had in the past, 
or given us the opportunity to 
try out new ones. Whether it be 
reading all those books you forgot 
about on your shelf, knitting 
dozens of (unwanted) scarves 
for your family, trying out that 
baking recipe you keep forgetting 
to do or binge-watching all of 
the programs and films you’ve 
missed out on because of work 
or school, we’ve all found ways 
to cope with the constant state 
of uncertainty with the help of 
light-hearted distraction, and 
more importantly, media. 

I have personally (and rather 

unashamedly) 
found 
myself 

clutching to any sort media 
possible in the last two years, 
including rewatching comfort 
television shows, reading piles 
of novels and getting through 
3,000 levels of Candy Crush. 
I am constantly scrolling my 
TikTok “For You” page, and I 
am religiously up to date with 
my “Goodreads” and “Serializd” 
accounts. I’ve become dependent 
upon my phone and laptop to 
provide me the perfect elixir 
of distraction from real life, 
whether that be school, politics 
or the pandemic. In all honesty, 
it has worked in the long run for 
the better of my mental health.

Psychological studies tend to 

say the same thing. In a report 
from Common Sense Media, 
it was found that 21% of young 
people said that using social 

media helped them feel “less 
alone” amid the pandemic (up 
from 15% in 2018), and 43% of 
respondents, aged 14 to 22, found 
that social media has eased nerves 
and the likelihood of depressive 
episodes. 
The 
upwards 
tilt 

in the usage of social media 
platforms, video-call services 
and streaming platforms is not 
unexplained by psychologists 
and media analysts: it has helped 
young people everywhere feel 
better about themselves and 
their surroundings, especially 
in such isolating and distressing 
circumstances.

As a society, we have deemed 

a reliance on media to be 
unbecoming 
and 
antisocial. 

Anyone who binges one too many 
episodes on Netflix is considered 
to be lazy, and anyone who likes 
one too many posts on Instagram 
is considered an addict. This 
stigma, especially in the age 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 

and the pandemic-influenced 
world, is incredibly damaging. 
It makes people who see media 
consumption as a form of comfort 
feel poorly about their coping 
mechanisms, that they should 
instead be “doing something 
with their lives.” Well, in the year 
2022, I happen to believe that just 
getting through your day is doing 
something, and it shouldn’t go 
unnoticed, no matter how many 
times you may have stopped to 
send out a tweet or sat down to 
watch a movie to do it. It’s still 
getting by.We look down on the 
“iPad baby” since it’s unnatural 
to us. At their age, we were 
comforted in different ways. But 
being a toddler in the pandemic is 
hard in and of itself, and we can’t 
help but sympathize with them 
and their cries of emotional pain 
when their mother takes away 
their tablet, because inside, each 
of us is, in our own way, a toddler; 
we feel this same codependency. 
The pandemic has made each of 
us reliant on technology to cope: 
the bright screen of an iPhone 
filling up that isolating void of 
quarantine and uncertainty. We 
must realize that, deep down, 
we are just like those sticky and 
drooly toddlers, because we too 
need the help of a screen at times.

he events of Jan. 6, 
2021, 
have 
been 
a 

topic 
of 
Republican 

revisionist 
history, 
willing 

ignorance 
and 
delusional 

falsehoods for over a year now. 
Leaders of the Republican 
Party have gone from blaming 
former 
President 
Donald 

Trump at least in part for the 
insurrection, to absolving him 
of all responsibility. Those who 
were once labeled domestic 
terrorists 
are 
now 
being 

labeled 
political 
prisoners, 

with Trump and his fiercest 
allies now floating pardons for 
the insurrectionists, claiming 
that they would mend alleged 
atrocities being committed by 
federal prosecutors.

Republican 
members 

of 
Congress 
all 
are 
but 

guaranteed 
to 
dodge 
any 

question regarding the day, 
and 
conveniently 
somehow 

never seem to have heard 
about the barrage of asinine 
comments from their fellow 
colleagues. Yet, through all of 
this, Republicans continue to 
claim they aren’t saying what 
they are, and don’t believe 
what they do.

In the span of a little under 

a week, this attitude finally 

changed with the leader of 
the Republican Party and the 
party’s 
official 
committee 

both finally admitting what 
political 
observers 
have 

long noted. The Republican 
Party at large believes that 
the 
insurrection 
was 
just 

and normal, a mere moment 
of 
political 
protest 
and 

discussion, and Donald Trump 
wanted former Vice President 
Mike Pence to single-handedly 
overturn the election. 

The 
first 
of 
the 
two 

admissions of guilt came from 
Trump himself when he went 
the furthest he ever has in 
his criticism of Mike Pence, 
this 
time 
outright 
saying 

that Pence alone could have 
overturned the will of over 80 
million voters. Though Trump 
has long critiqued Pence for 
his failure to reject electoral 
votes from battleground states 
— something he had no right 
to do — he has tried to phrase 
his critiques in such a way that 
he simply is asking for more 
time to consider supposed 
irregularities. Trump likewise 
posits that state legislatures 
merely ought to have had 
more time to debate newly 
found evidence of fraud, that 
of which did not exist. 

The statement was riddled 

with 
his 
usual 
gripes, 

claiming fraud and “many 

other 
irregularities” 
and 

slamming Susan Collins as a 
“wacky” RINO (Republican in 
name only). He also claimed 
that pending legislation, that 
would make it clear the vice 
president has no power to 
change the outcome, would 
take the power away from 
the vice president, something 
that is not accurate. Ignoring 
the immense hypocrisy of this 
position – how would he feel 
about Vice President Harris 
overturning election results 
and giving Biden a second 
term? This statement betrays 
the deep-rooted contempt that 
the former president and his 
backers have for democracy 
and the peaceful transfer of 
power. 

This was so abhorrent that 

even Pence directly called him 
out, disputing his claim and 
outright 
saying 
“President 

Trump is wrong.”

Even putting aside the fact 

that Trump is painfully wrong 
in regards to a vice president’s 
capacity, 
the 
idea 
of 
a 

president endeavoring to so 
blatantly, tactlessly and short-
sightedly disrupt the will of a 
majority of American voters is 
eye-opening, even for a man 
with a record like Trump’s.

Not 
to 
be 
outdone, 

Republican 
officials 
also 

made waves at the Republican 

National Committee’s winter 
summit in Salt Lake City, 
Utah. A censure resolution, led 
in part by RNC Chairwoman 
Ronna McDaniel, sought to 
condemn Representatives Liz 
Cheney, R-Wyo. and Adam 
Kinzinger, 
R-Ill. 
for 
their 

roles on the House Select 
Committee on the January 6 
Attack.

Republicans have long tried 

to dismiss the committee, 
claiming it is a partisan, 
Pelosi-led sham meant solely 
to hurt Donald Trump and 
his accomplices. That is a 
false claim, as the committee 
features the aforementioned 
two House Republicans, with 
Cheney as a co-chair of the 
committee. 
Additionally, 

House Republicans shot down 
an attempt to have an evenly 
partisan 
split 
investigation 

into the events of Jan. 6, one 
in which Republicans would 
have had subpoena power 
of their own, negotiated by 
a Republican representative 
that House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy himself had 
assigned to the negotiations.

The resolution said that the 

RNC 
should 
“immediately 

cease any and all support” of 
the two Republicans, that the 
pair “support Democrat efforts 
to destroy President Trump” 
and have engaged in acts “not 

befitting” Republican members 
of Congress. While all parts 
of the statement are insane in 
their own right, one sentence 
stands out in particular: “They 
chose to join Nancy Pelosi in 
a Democrat-led persecution 
of 
ordinary 
citizens 
who 

engaged in legitimate political 
discourse.” 
The 
statement, 

which McDaniel later tried 
to backtrack, was a stunning 
admission. 

It shows that prominent 

Republicans believe that an 
insurrection meant to thwart 
the 
democratic 
process, 

which led to the deaths of at 
least seven people, injured 
hundreds, defaced the capitol 
building and forced the vice 
president 
and 
others 
into 

hiding, 
was 
nothing 
more 

than ordinary citizens taking 
part 
in 
everyday 
political 

discussion. 
The 
claim, 

however egregious it is, is 
less surprising in itself than 
the fact that the official party 
committee 
was 
willing 
to 

admit such a disgusting belief.

The GOP has now tied 

themselves to this malicious 
lie; the lie that the most 
severe attack on the United 
States 
Capitol 
since 
1814 

was just citizens using their 
voice. A voice, according to 
them, 
that 
Kinzinger 
and 

Cheney are now maliciously 

silencing. According to the 
GOP, the fault lies with these 
two honest representatives, 
not the insurrectionists or 
those who necessitated their 
intervention.

That Trump and the RNC are 

now willing to be so forthright 
about their despicable actions 
and beliefs is a sign that things 
are getting worse, not better. 
Though they have both felt 
these ways for a while — with 
their continuous push for less 
protections for voters and 
more discretion for states to 
determine 
gerrymandered 

congressional maps — the fact 
that they now feel comfortable 
outright 
claiming 
these 

authoritarian ideas outright 
is just another dangerous step 
towards the dismantling of 
our fragile democracy. The 
midterm elections are now less 
than eight months away, and 
Republicans have been told 
by their leaders that political 
violence is no big deal, that 
election 
losses, 
no 
matter 

how legitimate, are not to be 
accepted and that violence 
is acceptable in an attempt 
to overturn an election. It is 
yet another ominous sign of 
what’s to come, and a potential 
pretext for something worse 
to 
happen 
the 
next 
time 

Republicans lose an important 
election.

W

e’ve all experienced 
it. A shoulder brush 
that 
knocks 
you 

painfully to the side; a body 
in your way, oblivious to the 
path you were trying to walk; 
a sidestep, right where your 
foot was supposed to go next. 
Space that was yours, invaded. 
Invaded is a harsh word to 
use, but it is a harsh action to 
experience as well. Society 
tells women that they must be 
small in every way. Verbally, 
in how they speak and voice 
opinions. Socially, in how they 
act and present themselves. 
And physically, in how much 
space they are allowed to take 
up. We are told to be so small, 
it’s like we aren’t even here, 
like no one can even see us. 

But I see you. I see you, 

girl 
on 
the 
M-Bus, 
with 

her legs turned toward the 
wall, leaning away from the 
stranger taking up his space 
and then some. Your seat is a 
foot and a half wide, and you 
shouldn’t have to share it. I 
see you, girl at the recreation 
center, waiting by the door in 
your leggings because another 
boy took the machine you’ve 
been waiting on for the past 
20 minutes. The leggings are 
cute, and it was your turn. 
I see you, girl in class, with 
your bag on the floor and your 
hands in your lap because the 
boy next to you has claimed 
half the table. I see you, girl 
who makes space for someone 
disregarding yours. I see you, 
girl feeling invisible. 

The invasion of space, both 

physically and socially, is so 
common that we have words 
for it. “Manspreading” and 
“mansplaining” 
are 
newly 

coined terms to describe men 
over-stepping both physically 
and 
in 
conversation. 
With 

both terms, they are holding 
more space for themselves 
than they should. The problem 
is, the bigger someone makes 
themselves, the smaller the 
people 
around 
them 
are 

forced to be. In “Shrinking 
Women,” Lily Myers says that 
“she wanes while (he) waxes,” 
and that women have been 
“taught 
accommodation,” 
a 

scene displayed with crossed 
arms and legs, folding in to 
be less. Women spend more 
time watching for others in 
their path while walking than 
men do, and stay within their 
bounds of the sidewalk more 
as well. It is clear that this 
problem persists in life all 
around, but what is to be done 
about it? 

This 
societal 
issue 
is 

hard to correct because it is 
subconsciously 
ingrained. 

One cannot fix the behavior 
before they are aware of 
the 
behavior, 
and 
thus 

unintentional 
behavior 

will require an intentional 
correction. 
Personal 
space, 

as is denoted in the name, is 
individual to each person, 
making it subjective and often 
subconscious. It is natural and 
acceptable to have different 
levels of comfort regarding 
personal 
space. 
However, 

we need to prioritize spatial 
awareness. We must make 
a conscious effort to notice 
and respect the space of those 
around 
us. 
This 
includes 

monitoring our own behavior, 
as well as that of others. 

Dr. Joanne Motiño Bailey, 

lecturer in the Women and 
Gender Studies Department 
at the University of Michigan, 
and 
Dr. 
Lisa 
Kane 
Low, 

professor within the School 
of Nursing at the University, 
present 
seven 
feminist 

strategies 
in 
“Gynecologic 

Health Care” that have been 
researched and found to enact 
the type of difficult social 
change that this situation calls 
for. One of these strategies is 
to analyze one’s own role or 
relationship to the issue. This 
can be done by anyone, of any 
gender, to support women. Ask 
yourself, what connection do 
you have to the issue, and how 
do you act because of that? 
Men may take up more space 
than warranted in this context 
compared to women, perhaps 
unintentionally. 

To implement this feminist 

strategy as a man, one might 
recognize his role in this 
issue, and then consciously 
decide to make space for 
others. For a woman, applying 
this strategy could be to 
recognize her position in this 
dynamic, and then to speak up 
about it. It is also important to 
advocate for others who may 
have a harder time asking for 
space. Speaking out does not 
need to be confrontational or 
unkind, and demanding space 
is not rude. Addressing the 
issue comes before resolving 
it. With intention and respect 
for all in mind, we can create 
an environment that is more 
comfortable 
for 
everyone 

around. 

To the women reading this, 

my message to you is that it 
is okay to take up space. You 
don’t have to be short or thin 
or tiny. Be strong, be capable. 
You don’t have to move; you 
are entitled to that bus seat 
just like any other student. 
You don’t have to yield; you 
were walking there first. You 
don’t have to shrink; that’s 
your personal space. You don’t 
have to make yourself smaller 
because others want you to be. 
It’s okay to take up space.

Trump and the RNC say the quiet parts out loud

Design by Maddy Leja, Opinion Cartoonist

J

ustice 
Stephen 
Breyer’s 

recent decision to retire was 
one of the few expected 

political developments in an era 
of tremendous uncertainty. After 
a long career of compromise 
that earned him the respect of 
both parties, Breyer’s retirement 
presents President Biden with a 
chance to re-center his struggling 
administration and make a lasting 
impact on the political climate of the 
nation. 

Judging by the strife that has 

accompanied 
recent 
nominees, 

Biden must approach his choice 
of a replacement with extreme 
caution. He must be careful to 
make a reasonable decision that 
doesn’t lead his presidency further 
astray. In order to accomplish this, 
Biden should look to nominate a 
nontraditional candidate who can 
voice a wider set of opinions than 
current justices: a centrist’s opinion. 

During the 2020 Democratic 

primaries, 
Biden 
promised 
to 

nominate a Black woman to the 
Supreme Court, a promise that 
revived his stagnant campaign. 
While his choice for the high court 
will be a history-making pick 
because of their demographic, 
if Biden is truly committed to 

diversifying the bench, he should 
also look for diversity elsewhere. 

The court is currently woefully 

homogeneous, with almost all of 
the justices coming from urban 
backgrounds, and all justices, beside 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, having 
attended Harvard or Yale. While it’s 
important to have highly qualified 
individuals on the bench, it’s also 
paramount to have voices that 
represent the breadth of American 
experiences. 

Though 
the 
multitude 
of 

traditional achievements amongst 
recent justices is evident, the 
similarity of their backgrounds 
is clear in both the cases they 
add to the court’s docket, which 
overwhelmingly 
originate 
from 

urban areas, and the rulings they 
ultimately make. In order to widen 
the breadth of experience in the 
highest court in the land and push 
back against the status quo, Biden 
should stray from convention and 
look for a judge from a nontraditional 
background.

In addition to selecting a nominee 

who represents a broader set of 
Americans, it’s important that 
Biden chooses a judge that mirrors 
the ideologically centrist views of 
the average citizen. While Biden 
himself is a moderate, his governing 
style over the first year of his 
administration has reflected the 
influence of left-wing activists in his 

party, whom Biden often struggles 
to push back against. 

With only three left leaning 

justices on the bench, the country 
needs another justice capable of 
compromising with the more right 
leaning wing of the court, in the 
mold of Justice Elena Kagan or 
Justice Breyer himself. If, however, 
Biden selects an activist Judge in 
the vein of Justice Sonya Sotomayor, 
who often goes out of her way to 
comment on national politics, he 
risks sabotaging any chance of 
compromise and ceding the court’s 
rulings to its right wing.

Justice Breyer made his mark on 

the court as a moderate always open 
to working with anyone on rulings. 
Of the three current left leaning 
justices, he has cast the lowest 
percentage of votes aligning with 
the left wing of his party, deviating 
on issues he believed would stoke 
ideological divides. In particular, 
he voted against the law to uphold 
the full Medicaid expansion, in 
the process negotiating with Chief 
Justice John Roberts to maintain 
the individual mandate, a ruling 
that 
ultimately 
kept 
millions 

of 
citizens 
with 
pre-existing 

conditions covered by the law. He 
also sided with conservative justices 
on issues of religious freedom, 
allowing the public display of 
the Ten Commandments in two 
distinct cases in an effort to avoid 

“religiously 
based 
divisiveness.” 

More recently, he has publicly 
opposed court-packing and has even 
gone so far as to pen multiple books 
defending the Supreme Court as a 
neutral institution. 

His willingness to compromise 

lent credence to the rulings that 
he ultimately decided to take 
strong stands on, allowing him to 
be the voice of reason in decisions 
protecting the right to abortion 
and to respectfully dissent to the 
expansion of the death penalty. 
Finding a new justice who follows 
this style is critical to maintaining 
a sense of balance on a court where 
the right wing outnumbers the left 
two to one.

Ultimately, 
Biden’s 
nominee 

for the Supreme Court will have 
profound implications on the law 
for decades to come, as well as 
immediate impacts on national 
unity. In a time when Americans face 
economic threats from the tailwinds 
of COVID-19 and international 
threats from China and Russia, the 
country certainly does not need 
the outer partisan battling that has 
accompanied recent nominations. 
By choosing a judge with a 
background that matches a broader 
set of American experiences, Biden 
has a rare opportunity to hit the 
reset button and finally deliver the 
unity he promised. Let’s hope he 
makes the right decision.

President Biden, it’s time for a diverse and 

centrist judiciary

SportsMonday: Michigan women’s basketball is 
a title contender, so start treating them like one

There’s something we try very 

hard not to do here at The Daily, and 
that’s write about the fans. 

For the three years I’ve cov-

ered the Michigan women’s 
basketball team, not talking 
about the crowd has been easy. 
It’s a sea of gray-haired retir-
ees that show up on a Sunday 
afternoon, politely applauding 
when a basket is scored and 
rarely rising into a raucous. 
It’s middle school basketball 
teams and church groups who 
come for a bonding activity. It’s less 
than a quarter of the total who come 
to men’s basketball games.

The curtains covering the upper 

bowl have only come up twice, both 
in the 2019-20 season: once for a dou-
ble-header where the women played 
after the men on a Saturday, and the 
other to host Michigan State. The 
stadium felt hollow in the double-
header, and the game against the 
Spartans is the only time I’ve seen 
the Crisler Center resemble capac-
ity — 11,068 fans attended that game. 

For 
reference, 
12,445 
fans 

watched the men’s basketball team 
play Southern Utah this past fall.

“(In men’s games) you see the 

student section’s all the way up in 
the rafters so it would be awesome 
to have that, it does make a differ-
ence,” senior wing Leigha Brown 
said on Jan. 9. “Obviously the fans 

are great but having the student sec-
tion there and bringing the energy 

would be huge.”

As you might expect, 

the disparity between 
men’s and women’s atten-
dance isn’t a phenomenon 
exclusive to basketball. 
Both soccer and lacrosse 
see atten-
dance dif-
ferences 
in 
the 

regular 

season, though not 
on the same scale. 
Of the four main 
sports that Michi-
gan has a men’s 
and 
women’s 

team 
competing 

at different times 
(soccer, 
basket-

ball, lacrosse and 
gymnastics), only 
women’s gymnas-
tics 
outperforms 

the men’s squad, 
and that’s because 
they mostly com-
pete in difference 
arenas with differ-
ent capicities. 

The 
disparity 

between these pro-
grams’ attendance 
can’t be explained 

by a difference in performance — 
the women’s soccer team made it 
to the Elite Eight this past season 
before falling to eventual champion 
Florida State and the women’s bas-
ketball team has been ranked in the 
top 10 for weeks.

It’s not because women’s sports 

aren’t as interesting, either. Television 

audiences for the women’s gymnas-
tics championship (which Michigan 
won, by the way), had a 510% increase 
in viewership from 2019 to 2021. Last 
year’s Women’s College World Series 
viewership increased by 10% over 
2019, leading to “numbers compa-
rable to those from the men’s College 
World Series in 2019.”

No, the difference in attendance 

is because the women’s teams don’t 
get enough attention, enough hype 
and, in reality, enough of anything. 
It’s the same reason the NCAA 
neglected women’s teams in the 
NCAA Tournament and continu-
ally treats women’s sports as less-
than. 

The hike in gym-

nastics 
viewership 

was so stark because 
ESPN 
and 
Disney 

gave it the attention it 
deserved and put it on 
ABC, instead of hid-
ing it on ESPNU. The 
women’s 
basketball 

team is in the middle 
of a Big Ten Title race 
in part because the 
student section finally 
started to give it atten-
tion, showing up to 
ranked games. 

Instead of 20-30 

students in groups 
of three or five sit-
ting 
down, 
relax-

ing, there’s constant 
noise. Loud applause 
that rouses the nor-
mal attendees and 
turns the energy into 
something greater. It 
spurs on senior Dani-
elle Rauch to make 

behind-the-back passes and senior 
forward Naz Hillmon to put defend-
ers into a spin cycle.

“We see it at the men’s games all 

the time,” women’s basketball coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said. “So I think 
they truly are difference makers 
and I also think when our student 
athletes see their peers there it’s 
really special and means a lot to 
have them there.”

In women’s basketball, far more 

than men’s, crowds can impact the 
play because most teams aren’t used 
to playing in such hostile environ-
ments. In three of the Wolverines’ 
four losses, they played in arenas 
with larger-than-average crowds, 
including their loss to Michigan 
State on Thursday.

But now, as Michigan stares 

down a fight to host the first and 
second rounds of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, its attendance average (when 
fans have been allowed) is the low-
est since 2016-17 at 2,910. While the 
Wolverines are second in the Big Ten 
standings, that attendance average is 
10th in the conference.

There’s no reason for that to be the case 

except that people aren’t paying enough 
attention to the women’s basketball team. 
And they’ve missed out on two top-5 
wins, an All-American candidate and a 
team that’s avenged losses all season. 

So start paying attention and 

start going to games.

Women’s sports at Michigan deserve more attention.

Michigan’s upperclassmen shine 

against Michigan State on Senior Day

If there’s one word that charac-

terizes Michigan’s senior class, it’s 
special.

In front of a sellout crowd on 

Senior Day, the Wolverines’ upper-
classmen showed just why they fit 
that description, securing dominant 
victories over the rival Spartans in 
five out of six bouts.

No. 1 graduate student Nick Suri-

ano started Sunday’s meet off strong 
with a major decision victory over 
Tristan Lujan. Competing at 125 lbs, 
Suriano was in control of the match 
from start to finish, a position he has 
become accustomed to throughout 
his college wrestling career. A for-
mer NCAA 133 lb champion, Suriano 
posted a 70-7 record over his first 
three seasons at Rutgers and is 7-0 
for the Wolverines; Sunday just con-
tinued that dominance.

“Nick Suriano is a special talent,” 

graduate student Kanen Storr said. 
“He always sets the pace and sets the 
tone for not only himself but for the 

Michigan wrestling team. He’s fear-
less, he knows how hard he works 
and every time he steps out on the 
mat, he wants to show that and prove 
it.”

Not only has Suriano been suc-

cessful individually, but he has con-
tributed significantly to the success 
of Michigan as a whole, leading by 
example.

“Nick has been just a tremendous 

addition to the team,” Michigan 
coach Sean Bormet said. “He lives a 
super regimented, disciplined life-
style. It’s a champion’s lifestyle, day 
in day out, and he’s a warrior on the 
mat. He brings a lot of intensity and a 
lot of fire to his wrestling, and that’s 
contagious.”

That intensity showed against 

Lujan, as Suriano wrestled at a con-
stant rapid pace and scored take-
down after takedown.

Suriano wasn’t the only senior 

Wolverine who impacted Sunday’s 
match and has led by example this 
season. No. 5 graduate student 
Logan Massa, who defeated Nathan 
Jimenez in dominant fashion with a 
tech fall, has used his own toughness 

to challenge his teammates and push 
them to greater success all season.

“(Massa is) somebody who’s 

gonna wrestle you really tough and 
push you to the limits,” graduate 
student Myles Amine said. “(It’s) 
not always the prettiest way, but he’s 
been a great impact, just that energy 
and that meanness is something that 
if you know wrestling, you know that 
that’s good for the sport and it’s good 
for our team.”

Massa — along with Amine and 

graduate student Stevan Micic, who 
secured a victory over Matt Santos 
with an emphatic takedown to end 
the match — decided to return to 
Michigan for a final year of eligibil-
ity. All three have played key roles in 
Michigan’s success all season.

“It was more of a team decision 

for their passion for Michigan wres-
tling,” Bormet said. “Individually, 
obviously they want to have success 
and they have their goals, but this is 
the reason they came back. I know 
today was really special for them.”

But not all of Sunday’s competi-

tors have found consistent collegiate 
dominance. Sunday’s match was 
especially significant for Storr, who 
returned from injury to defeat Pey-
ton Omania by a score of 5-2. 

“It was huge,” Storr said. “It was 

a lot of emotion, this last time wres-
tling here in Cliff Keen Arena. And 
not only that, I had a lot to prove, that 
I’m gonna step back in this lineup 
and I’m gonna score points for this 
team.”

All five seniors who secured vic-

tories on Sunday have been critical 
in shaping Michigan’s overall suc-
cess, through both their own indi-
vidual accomplishments and their 
contributions as team leaders. And 
as the postseason nears, the upper-
classmen hope to add another word 
to their description:

Champions.

The Michigan wrestling team’s upperclassmen continued their dominant 
seasons against Michigan State. 

Michigan tops Michigan State, 

24-13, in final home dual

As Michigan gears up for the upcom-

ing NCAA Championships, the Wolver-
ines’ final home dual meet of the year 
served as another test for the squad. 

They passed with flying colors. 
The No. 3-ranked Michigan wres-

tling team (10-1 overall, 5-1 Big Ten) 
extended its five match winning streak 
against No. 14 Michigan State (9-3, 4-3), 
winning seven of the first eight matches. 
Sunday’s 24-13 victory sent off a lengthy 
class of seniors and graduate students in 
their final regular season contest in Cliff 
Keen Arena

It’s hard to find a wrestler more con-

sistent than No. 1 graduate student Nick 
Suriano. At 125 lbs, Suriano asserted his 
dominance against Tristan Lujan from 
start to finish, earning a 14-3 major deci-
sion to put the Wolverines up 4-0. 

“Nick Suriano, he’s special,” Michi-

gan coach Sean Bormet said. “The 
guys have connected with him quickly 
because of the intensity, the work ethic 
and the way he competes.”

But the Spartans bounced right back 

from Suriano’s display.

After No. 7 Dylan Ragusin’s loss to 

Spartans’ No. 11 Rayvon Foley, No. 17 
graduate student Stevan Micic hoped 
to prevent consecutive Michigan State 
match wins.

Micic’s season has been filled with 

difficult injuries and inconsistent train-
ing, but following a win against Indiana 
on Friday, he had an opportunity to 
come out of his last home match on a 
good note. Micic came out prosperous, 
winning a 10-3 decision.

Following Micic’s win, 149-pounder 

Kanen Storr – another injury-ridden 
senior – displayed resilience in a final 
home win of his own.

“I made a decision to believe in myself 

and work hard,” Storr said. “I knew once 
I stepped back in this lineup that I was 
going to prove that I’m here to stay, and 
I’m here to do a job for this team.” 

A takedown late in the second period 

gave Storr a narrow 4-2 lead, and a rela-
tively stagnant third period cemented 
the win. The 5-2 decision validated 
Storr’s hard work.

In a low scoring match where nei-

ther of the 157 lb wrestlers took control, 
No. 9 redshirt junior Will Lewan came 
out victorious over No. 17 ranked Chase 
Saldate. His takedown with 30 seconds 
remaining to secure a 3-1 advantage led 
to a 3-2 victory by decision.

Going into intermission, the Wol-

verines held a 13-3 lead. Coming out of 
the break, the Michigan upperweights 
extended it.

Although a 5-1 decision may not seem 

like a dominant win, 165 lb redshirt 
sophomore Cameron Amine imposed 
his will on his Spartan opponent. From 
the very beginning, Amine displayed 
his strength, lifting Nathan Jimenez off 
the mat multiple times throughout the 
match. 

“He’s just an incredible gamer,” 

graduate student Myles Amine said of 
his younger brother. “Come a few weeks 
from now he’s gonna surprise a lot of 

people, but he’s not going to surprise 
me.”

Also dominant was No. 5 Logan 

Massa. Massa’s early takedown and 
two consecutive nearfalls gave the 174 
lb graduate student a 12-0 lead. Two 
takedowns and a Michigan State stall 
finalized a technical fall, increasing 
Michigan’s lead to 21-3. 

Myles has proven his importance 

throughout the season, and Sunday 
showed no different. Despite strug-
gling to find his rhythm in the first two 
periods, a ferocious intensity in the final 
period secured Myles a 8-4 decision 
over Spartans’ No. 19 Layne Malcze-
wski at 184 lbs.

In Sunday’s victory, Michigan’s 

seniors rose to the occasion, but it is clear 
that these seniors are waiting for some-
thing bigger to celebrate this season.

“We’re hosting NCAAs,” Myles said. 

“So technically, my senior day is going to 
be on March 19, the NCAA finals.”

And if the Wolverines perform the 

way they did against the Spartans, 
they’ll have plenty to celebrate.

The No. 3 Michigan wrestling team dominated Michigan State on Senior 
Day, 24-13.

Michigan dominates in singles, finds path to victory over Illinois

On Friday night, the No. 20 

Michigan men’s tennis team 
showed up looking for a come-
back after a loss against then-No. 
19 Harvard the week prior.

It succeeded. 
With the Wolverines’ second 

and third doubles teams both 
losing both 4-6, Michigan strug-
gled to make room against an 
unranked Illinois. The Fighting 
Illini won the doubles point over 
the Wolverines, spelling an early 

end for the first doubles match.

For Michigan, losing the dou-

bles point was concerning; they 
rely on their strength as a doubles 
team, and losing the point was an 
early blow.

That outcome only fueled 

the Wolverines’ path to victory. 
Though they struggled in their 
doubles matchups, there was 
no such issue with their singles 
matches. After giving up the dou-
bles point, Michigan (4-2 overall) 
swept Illinois (1-5) in the singles 
and claimed a 4-1 overall win. 

“We had a big chip on our 

shoulder coming out for the sin-

gles,” Michigan senior Patrick 
Maloney said. “We weren’t happy 
with the doubles result, but it 
really helped us.” 

That optimism was almost tan-

gible on the court, each side build-
ing off of each other’s victories to 
create a momentum that went 
unmatched by the Fighting Illini. 
When senior Andrew Fenty won 
his first set, 6-0, it was the boost 
both Maloney and sophomore 
Jacob Bickersteth the drive they 
needed to claim their respective 
first sets 7-5 and 7-6. 

On the other side of the court, 

junior Ondrej Styler led in a simi-

lar manner, commanding a 6-1 
first set followed by a quick sec-
ond set, which he claimed 6-4.

Sophomore Gavin Young won 

the final point needed to secure 
a Michigan victory, battling out a 
tough win to take his second set. 
Young ended the night 6-3 and 
7-5, giving the Wolverines a much-
needed success to boost morale. 

“We view our doubles as one 

of our biggest strengths in our 
team,” Maloney said. “So, to have 
a dominant win over a team like 
Illinois… huge confidence boost-
er. We could’ve had six points on 
the board right there.”

With the loss of a point they 

expected to win, the Wolverines 
used the loss to bolster their con-
fidence in the singles matches.

With 
the 
win, 
Michigan 

snapped a seven game losing 
streak against Illinois. However, 
even after coming away with a 
victory, it seems that there is a lot 
to build on.

“We have to play better,” 

Michigan coach Adam Steinberg 
said. “If we’re going to be a con-
tender to win championships… to 
lose the doubles point is tough. 
That’s the biggest focus now – 
has to be.”

W

hen it’s boiled down 
to its bare bones, 
basketball 
has 
a 

simple premise: get the ball in 
the basket.

When a team can’t do that 

efficiently, 
the 
chances 
of 

coming away with a win drop 
significantly.

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team (13-10 overall, 
7-6 Big Ten) proved the adage 
true on Saturday, falling to 
No. 16 Ohio State (15-6, 8-4), 
68-57, in a showing fraught 
with offensive inefficiency. 

“We got good looks,” fifth-

year guard Eli Brooks said. 
“We missed a lot of layups, a 
lot of bunnies, a lot of stuff 
around the rim that we should 
have made. And it’s tough 

when tough when you don’t 
make the easy ones.”

From the start, the game 

looked 
like 
a 
rock 
fight. 

Both 
the 
Wolverines 
and 

Buckeyes — 19th and seventh 
in the country in KenPom’s 
adjusted offensive efficiency 
— struggled to make any 
gains offensively. Each bucket 
was hard-earned, and both 
teams’ offensive possessions 
were marred by turnovers 
and missed shots in a messy 
back-and-forth 
showdown. 

Eventually, 
the 
offenses 

gained some traction, giving 
Ohio State a 3-point lead at 
the half.

Coming out of the break, 

where 
Michigan 
would 

have liked to see a spark to 
ignite a comeback, it instead 
saw smoke. At the under-12 
timeout, the Wolverines found 
themselves in an 8-point hole 

after shooting a measly 3-for-
12 from the field to start the 
half. The Buckeyes, though not 
accelerating their offensive 
rate, kept up the pace from 
the first half, which proved 
to be enough in the face of an 
anemic Michigan attack.

The Wolverines were simply 

not the high-scoring team 
that decimated No. 3 Purdue 
Thursday 
night. 
Typically, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
sinks 

its ship, but the Wolverines 
were actually able to amount 
stops. They simply couldn’t 
capitalize on the opportunities 
they were creating, in spite of 
having the ability to do so.

“We know that we have 

shooters on the team,” Brooks 
said. “We prove it in practice, 
we 
prove 
it 
through 
our 

numbers throughout the year. 
I mean, (it’s) just confidence. I 
think we need to just shoot our 

shots and be more confident 
taking our shots.”

It was a far cry from the 

Michigan team that bared its 
formidable fangs against the 
Boilermakers. The Wolverine 
squad that dropped 82 points 
and made over half of its shots 
from the floor and from deep 
was nowhere to be found come 
Saturday.

Instead, a shell of itself 

stood in its place. Michigan 
posted 
an 
underwhelming 

41.4% from the field and a 
tragic 23.5% from beyond the 
arc.

“We 
shot 
4-for-17 
from 

three, and there were some 
really 
good 
looks 
at 
the 

basket,” 
Michigan 
coach 

Juwan Howard said. “I would 
say maybe five of them were 
forced 
(misses). 
But 
other 

than that, it just didn’t go in 
for us, but we stay with it.”

With every missed shot, 

the Wolverines lost a chance 
to 
build 
momentum. 
And 

when they did make a much-
needed bucket, the Buckeyes 
always found a way to silence 
the Crisler crowd and halt 
Michigan in its tracks.

Star Ohio State forward 

E.J. Liddell stood on the 
front lines of the Buckeyes’ 
spoils. Dropping 28 points 
on the Wolverines’ defense 
with 
odds-defying 
makes 

and clinical shots. Flanked 
by the rest of Ohio State’s 
contributors, it was too much 
for Michigan on a night where 
it wasn’t at its best.

“He’s gonna make tough 

shots,” Howard said. “… And 
that’s what it was tonight. 
Liddell made a lot of tough 
shots.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
typical 

saviors didn’t have it in them 

to resurrect their team from 
the deficit. Sophomore center 
Hunter Dickinson notched just 
14 points on 7-of-17 shooting, 
freshman wing Caleb Houstan 
came away with a miserable 
five and besides Dickinson, 
only 
fifth-year 
guard 
Eli 

Brooks 
broke 
into 
double 

digits.

Down 
the 
stretch, 
as 

Michigan 
floundered, 
the 

Buckeyes 
pulled 
away. 

Without the ability to score 
efficiently, the comeback was 
never realized.

With the chance to grab 

their second Quadrant 1 win 
in a row and put themselves 
in a better position to make 
the NCAA Tournament, the 
Wolverines came up short.

As Brooks saw it, the reason 

why was pretty simple:

“We just didn’t make shots.”
