CITY COUNCIL

Jane Lumm, Sally 

Hart Peterson 

address pedestrian 

safety, deer cull

By ANNA HARITOS

For the Daily

With 
Election 
Day 
less 

than 
a 
month 
away, 
City 

Councilmember Jane Lumm (I–
Ward 2) and former Democratic 
councilmember 
Sally 
Hart 

Petersen took to the podium 
Sunday to pitch their candidacies 
for City Council.

The Ward 2 race is the only 

City Council seat that will be 
decided in November’s general 
election. Races for the other open 
seats were largely determined 
during the August Democratic 
primary, though those nominees 
will still appear on the ballot next 
month.

Sunday’s event was held at 

the Traverwood Branch Library. 
After a brief opening statement 
from each candidate, both fielded 
questions from the audience.

One topic of discussion was 

potential 
expansion 
of 
the 

rails that pass along the Huron 
River and through Ann Arbor’s 
forests. Petersen pointed out 
how the expansion would bring 
in revenue, as well as provide 
convenient service for students 
and other travelers. Lumm said 
there might be an issue with 
locals and students if public 
parkland was repurposed.

“The $64 million question 

would be if the trade-off of the 
public parkland and the train-
track expansion would pay off 
economically,” Lumm said.

From there, the candidates 

moved onto the topic of the deer 
cull — the killing of deer in Ann 
Arbor by hired sharpshooters to 
curb the deer population — that is 
set to take place in January.

Lumm said she approves of 

the council’s vote to hold the 
cull. Petersen disagreed, saying 
when the council voted for the 
cull, public concerns were not 
fully taken into account. She also 
pointed out how the cull would 
not be very effective due to the 
park’s proximity to the Nichols 
Arboretum.

Mary Stewart, former event services coordinator for the Michigan Union, presents the first scholarship of her namesake fund to Kinesiology freshman Jordan 
Atkins at the Michigan Union on Friday. Stewart was dedicated to creating inclusive spaces for students from minority backgrounds. The merit scholarship will 
be presented to Black students through the Alumni Assocation’s LEAD Scholars program, which seeks to diversify the University’s student body. 

Money raised to

Association’s 
LEAD Scholars

Daily Staff Reporter

Over a 42-year career at 

the University, Mary Stewart, 
the 
former 
event 
services 

coordinator for the Michigan 

Union, mentored hundreds of 
students before her retirement 
in April. Now, a scholarship 
named in her honor will help 
University students for years to 
come.

On Friday, students and 

alumni 
gathered 
in 
the 

Michigan Union to officially 
launch the scholarship, which 
aims to help Black students 
attend the University. During 
more than four decades at the 
University, Stewart became an 
unofficial mentor to students 

across 
campus, 
particularly 

students 
from 
minority 

backgrounds.

The scholarship fund is part 

of the Alumni Association’s 
LEAD 
Scholars 
Program, 

which was designed to increase 
the diversity of the student 
body. LEAD offers four-year 
merit scholarships to admitted 
students who embody four 
values: leadership, excellence, 
achievement 
and 
diversity. 

Over the past eight years, LEAD 
has 
successfully 
recruited 

more than 130 Black students 
to the University.

Steve Grafton, president 

and CEO of the University’s 
Alumni 
Association, 
said 

the association wants to 
impact 
campus 
climate 

by making the University 
more 
accessible 
to 

underrepresented students.

“We’ve been trying to open 

doors for all kinds of students,” 
Grafton said at the event Friday.

Michigan earns 
third straight 
shutout against 
Northwestern

The Wolverines 

improve to 5-1 with 

the victory

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

The chant began in the final 

minute of No. 18 Michigan’s win 
against No. 13 Northwestern 
on Saturday. The two syllables 
boomed 
throughout 
the 
Big 

House, 
echoing 
around 
the 

stadium long after Jehu Chesson’s 
game-opening touchdown, long 
after the outcome had been 
decided.

Wolverine fans had watched 

their team dominate the Wildcats 
for the better part of three hours 
and seven minutes, and they 
decided 
to 
leave 
Michigan’s 

defense with a parting gift. 
“DE-FENSE!” 
they 
yelled. 

The team, in turn, showed its 
appreciation by motioning for the 
fans to be louder.

The defense was unrelenting 

in Michigan’s 38-0 undressing 
of Northwestern, just as it has 
been for much of this season. The 
Wolverines posted their third 
consecutive shutout, marking the 
first time a Michigan defense had 
accomplished that feat since 1980.

The Wolverines sacked Wildcat 

quarterbacks four times in the 
victory and allowed just 168 total 
yards. Junior cornerback Jourdan 
Lewis returned an interception 
for a touchdown in the second 
quarter, ripping the ball from the 
clutches of Northwestern wide 
receiver Mike McHugh, and the 
Wildcats never sniffed the red 
zone.

string 
of 
nearly 

unprecedented 
success

The weekend-long event,

Nearly 150 graduates were 

scheduled to participate, with 

notable alumni in attendance, 
including “Glee” star Darren

Event organizer Jennifer 

Knapp,

Shapiro kicks off fundraising

HOMECOMING E- R ADE

Then-University 
Presi-

dent Harold Shapiro, the 
namesake for the Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library, 

launched a $160 million fun-
draising drive in his State of 
the University address at 
Rackham Auditorium.

This initiative was part 

of a plan he announced to 
reduce the size of the Uni-
versity, yet retain its qual-
ity.

“We are focused on two 

primary — and complemen-
tary — goals: to increase our 
endowment for faculty sup-
port and student financial 
aid, and to fund select new 
construction projects,” Sha-
piro said.

Some of the money raised 

in the campaign was used to 
erect a new chemistry build-
ing and make improvements 
at the Business School.

Study finds fraternity 
and sorority members 
experience discrimina-
tion (56 years ago: Oct. 

14, 1959)

According to responses 

to questionnaires sent to 
students 
at 
universities 

with more than nine frater-
nities or sororities, students 
at more than 75 percent 
of 
campuses 
surveyed 

observed either written or 
unwritten 
discriminatory 

practices.

Sixty-three 
universities 

responded to the study, of 
which 50 admitted at least 
one of their fraternities or 
sororities pursues discrimi-
natory membership policies.

At 25 of those 50 colleges, 

the fraternities or sororities 
were forced to pursue such 
policies by their national 
organizations.

In many cases, members 

of groups often subject 
to 
discrimination 
either 

did not apply or were not 
accepted 
to 
fraternities 

or sororities, avoiding the 
problem entirely.

NY Philharmonic plays with 
Marching Band at halftime

SAE tradition 

continues despite 
University efforts 

to cancel event

By RIYAH BASHA

For the Daily

Shin-deep in mud, former 

members of the now-disbanded 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity 
hosted their 82nd annual Mud 
Bowl game on Saturday morning, 
despite University efforts to can-
cel the event.

Two teams of about 20 people 

played a game of two-hand touch 
football in an expansive mud pit 
constructed in front of the for-
mer SAE house at South Univer-
sity and Washtenaw avenues.

Though the final tally hasn’t 

been calculated, the charity 
touch-football game raised over 
$8,000 for C.S. Mott’s Children’s 
Hospital. Public Policy junior 
Zach Dubin, a former SAE mem-
ber who helped organize the 

event, said about 2,000 T-shirts 
were sold for the event and 
almost $7,000 was raised on the 
Mud Bowl’s GoFundMe page.

Though planning for this 

year’s game was complicated by 
SAE’s status as a rogue fraternity, 
hundreds of students and alumni 
surrounded the muddy field to 
cheer. Dubin estimated the num-
ber could have been more than a 
thousand, with people covering 
the lawn and spilling onto the 
sidewalk.

Earlier this year, fraternity 

and sorority members were 
warned by the Interfraternity 
Council not to participate in the 
event, since SAE is no longer 
recognized by the University 
or its national chapter. The IFC 
expelled the fraternity in 2011 
due to reports of hazing. Because 
Greek life members were told not 
to participate in the event, play-
ers took the field identifying not 
as Greek life members, but as 
individual students.

Durbin said the University’s 

decision to enforce these restric-
tions may have actually benefited 

the Mud Bowl in terms of boost-
ing attendance and interest. 
However, he said donations were 
lost once fraternity organizations 
were barred from participating 
in the event.

“As for next year, I doubt the 

University will back offtheir 
stance, but I really hope they 
reconsider to let all students, 
regardless of Greek or non-Greek 
affiliation, participate in what 
should be an event for everyone 
in the Michigan community to 
enjoy,” he said.

The team composed of for-

mer SAE members, nicknamed 
the Flying Eagles, defeated their 
opponents — a team made up of 
participants from a variety of 
groups — 24-10.

“It felt pretty amazing,” said 

LSA sophomore Jake Harris, 
despite hailing from the losing 
team. “Physically, I feel actually 
great, and even though we lost, 
it was just about going out there 
and having fun with the tradi-
tion.”

Performance 

marks beginning of 
orchestra’s five-year 
residency at the ‘U’

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan football’s shutout 

against 
Northwestern 
wasn’t 

the only memorable event to 
take place on the field at the Big 
House on Saturday.

The New York Philharmonic 

Orchestra took the field along-
side the Michigan Marching 
Band and the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance brass studios to 
perform a variety of songs.

And for this collaboration, it’s 

only the beginning: the famous 
symphony orchestra will now 
begin a five-year long residency 
in Ann Arbor.

John 
Pasquale, 
associate 

director of bands at the Uni-

versity, wrote in an e-mail that 
the halftime show marks the 
start of a multi-year partnership 
between the New York Philhar-
monic and the University. The 
symphony orchestra’s residency 
in Ann Arbor will include mas-
terclasses, lectures and perfor-
mances.

The residency will include 

lectures, 
performances 
and 

other educational opportuni-
ties for students. The University 
Musical Society will also bring 
three different orchestras to the 
University each year in addition 
to the New York Philharmonic.

LSA senior Emily Jablonski, a 

member of the marching band, 
said the group practiced Friday 
night with the New York Phil-
harmonic and the brass studio, 
and said she enjoyed learning 
from the New York Philharmon-
ic’s director, who conducted 
several pieces during the perfor-
mance.

“It’s hard to describe,” she 

said. “It was, in my experience, 

the most exciting show that I’ve 
ever participated in. During the 
last piece that we were playing I 
was smiling so big it was almost 
hard to play my instrument. To 
hear all of us playing at the same 
time almost made me emotional. 
The sound of all of us playing 
together — it worked out so well 
and the New York Phil are such 
prolific players and it was amaz-
ing.”

LSA senior Matt Cloutier, the 

band’s drum major, said Friday’s 
rehearsal was especially spirited 
because it was the first time the 
band experienced playing with 
the New York Philharmonic.

“We’d been practicing the 

show for the week, however, we 
didn’t practice with the New 
York Phil until Friday night.” he 
said. “We did a dress rehearsal 
before that was actually an 
open rehearsal so some people 
got to come in and watch. They 
were super excited to be there 
and we were super excited to 
have them there, so it was defi-
nitely high energy. They were 
absolutely incredible and their 
director, Alan Gilbert, he was 
fantastic.”

Though the halftime show 

consisted of a variety of songs, 
both Jablonski and Cloutier said 
the finale stood out most for 
them.

Pasquale wrote that watching 

the students perform not only 
with the New York Philharmon-
ic, but with the alumni band, the 
brass studios and chorale was an 
experience he won’t forget.

“The students’ reaction is why 

we teach — seeing their faces 
as they were playing is a high-
light of my career thus far,” he 
wrote. “The (Michigan March-
ing Band’s) performance was 
fantastic and we are so proud of 
them. What they accomplished 
is testament that Michigan has 
the best and brightest students 
in the world. It was a great day 
for the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance and Michigan Athlet-
ics. It was a great day for the 
legacy, tradition and spirit of 
Michigan.”

defenders. They had been bullied 
and brushed aside at times in 
the past, before Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh and defensive 
coordinator D.J. Durkin came 
to town, but those days are no 
more. The unusual has become 
routine. Michigan became the 
first Football Bowl Subdivision 
team to record three consecutive 
shutouts since 1995, according 
to STATS.

“It’s expected,” said redshirt 

freshman safety Jabrill Peppers. 
“We have to be great. That’s the 
standard around here.”

Standards aside, the degree 

to which the Wolverines (2-0 
Big Ten, 5-1 overall) dismantled 
their 
foe 
was 
unexpected. 

Northwestern (1-1, 5-1) entered 
the game as an undefeated 
opponent with the country’s 
stingiest 
scoring 
defense, 

surrendering seven points per 
game.

But 
it 
was 
clear 
almost 

immediately 
that 
those 

statistics 
were 
irrelevant. 

Chesson, a redshirt junior wide 
receiver, returned the game’s 
opening kickoff 96 yards for a 
touchdown. Michigan’s sideline 
erupted.

Earlier 
this 
week, 

Northwestern’s 
coaches 

indicated they did not plan to 
kick to Peppers, who lined up 
to receive the kick opposite of 
Chesson. Sending the ball to 
Chesson, of course, did not yield 

better results. 

“Big mistake,” Peppers said 

with a laugh.

Michigan 
seized 
the 

momentum and maintained it. 
The Wolverines scored again 
with 10:20 remaining in the 
first quarter, the offense gliding 
down the field on a seven-play, 
59-yard drive. Redshirt junior 
running back Drake Johnson 
capped it with a one-yard 
touchdown.

Michigan did not allow the 

Wildcats to put up much of a 
fight.

“The 
fellas 
really 
came 

out balling from the start,” 
Harbaugh said.

The 
balling 
never 
really 

stopped for the Wolverines. 
Michigan tacked on another 
score with 2:35 remaining in the 
first quarter, when fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
scrambled for a two-yard run 
into the end zone.

The Wolverines’ defense even 

got involved in the scoring. 
Lewis picked off Northwestern 
quarterback Clayton Thorson 
with 3:20 remaining in the half 
and returned it 37 yards for 
a touchdown. After the play, 
Durkin chest bumped the nearest 
person on the sideline.

By the end of the game, his 

unit extended its scoreless streak 
to 12 quarters. The Wolverines’ 
offensive players were familiar 
with what the Wildcats were 
going through.

“Going against them every day 

in practice is kind of stressful 
sometimes,” said junior running 

back De’Veon Smith.

Any 
stress 
for 
Michigan 

during Saturday’s game was 
limited. The Wolverines did not 
turn the ball over, and mistakes 
were few and far between. One 
of the few causes for concern 
came in the third quarter, when 
senior linebacker James Ross 
III was ejected from the game 
for targeting after he led with 
his helmet. He will miss the first 
half of next week’s game against 
No. 4 Michigan State.

Harbaugh, 
though, 
wasn’t 

too worried about the looming 
matchup against the Spartans. 
He noted that it will be a tough 
game but said preparation will 
be no different than it is any 
other week.

His 
team 
will 
be 
hard-

pressed to match Saturday’s 
performance. Michigan did not 
relent even in the game’s waning 
moments, scoring its fifth and 
final 
touchdown 
with 
2:14 

remaining.

Michigan has outscored its 

opponents, 160-14, in its last five 
games. Wolverine fans have not 
yet witnessed Harbaugh lose a 
game at home as the Wolverines’ 
coach. The coach was pleased 
with how physical his team was, 
particularly 
without 
getting 

injured.

“It’s 
a 
good 
sign, 
that 

you’re building a good callus,” 
Harbaugh said. “Play physical 
and not get beat up yourself. 
That’s a good gauge, probably the 
best gauge that the team is, the 
callus is hardening. Like a callus 
on a foot, it’s not soft and pus-y.”

“We 
have 
regional 

committee members,” she said. 
“So we have members in New 
York, Chicago and LA, and then 
we also have a local committee 
alumni group.”

The first prime time of the 

weekend, 
a 
reception, 
was 

held in the Power Center for 
the Performing Arts. At the 
conclusion of the reception, 
StarKid, 
a 
production 

company formed by Michigan 
students through the student 
organization Basement Arts, 
performed its most popular 
numbers from several of their 
past shows, including routines 
from “A Very Potter Musical” 
and “Me and My Dick.”

Criss, 
starring 
as 
Harry 

Potter, opened the show and 
was later joined by additional 
cast 
members 
to 
perform 

their number, “Goin’ Back to 
Hogwarts.”

Theatre Prof. Nancy Uffner, 

a production stage manager 
for 
University 
Productions, 

said she was excited to see her 
students interact with alumni.

“I think it’s important for 

the current students to see 
the alumni and to see all the 
different choices they can make 
with their theatre degree,” she 
said.

Uffner, 
who 
received 
a 

master’s degree from the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, said 
she was also looking forward 
to 
reconnecting 
with 
her 

former classmates from the 
school’s now-defunct graduate 
program, and seeing how they 
thought the school had changed 
since their time there.

Since the school has shifted 

entirely 
to 
undergraduate 

studies, 
Uffner 
said 
there 

are more opportunities for 
undergraduates 
than 
there 

would be otherwise.

“All the principal roles are 

played 
by 
undergraduates, 

undergraduate 
students 
get 

to 
design 
scenery, 
lights, 

costumes,” she said. “These 
kids walk out of here with a 

portfolio. That’s a big deal.”

Friday night’s event was a 

red carpet reception hosted in 
the Walgreen Drama Center 
on North Campus, followed by 
a performance of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play “All My 
Sons,” written by University 
alum Arthur Miller.

During 
the 
reception, 

alumni 
walked 
across 
the 

red carpet, where they were 
filmed 
and 
interviewed 
by 

faculty members of the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance to 
remember the occasion.

School of Music, Theatre & 

Dance freshman Liam Loomis, 
who attended events over the 
weekend, said Friday he was 
looking forward to learning 
from 
former 
students 
and 

garnering inspired by where 
their degrees have taken them.

“I’m 
looking 
forward 
to 

making a connection,” he said. 
“It would be very helpful and 
reassuring for me to hear all 
the fantastic things people have 
done, hoping I can follow in 
their footsteps.

diversity so that it can help the 
entire University.”

Grafton also thanked Stewart 

for dedicating her long career to 
helping minority students.

“Mary is such a caring and 

compassionate person,” Grafton 
said. “It’s all about building 
relationships, 
which 
is 
why 

so many students and alums 
have made such a commitment 
tonight.”

University alum Mike Muse, 

who 
helped 
organize 
the 

scholarship, said Stewart helped 
many minority students become 
leaders 
all 
around 
campus, 

particularly when the University 
did not do so.

“The student leaders didn’t 

always get support from such a big 
university who wasn’t committed 
to increasing diversity,” he said. 
“But we had her.”

University alum Dhani Jones, 

who graduated in 2000 and 
played for the Michigan football 
team, thanked Stewart for the 
help and guidance she offered 
him throughout his time at the 

University.

“I’ve learned the importance 

of giving to others,” Jones said. 
“Mary Stewart embodies the true 
elements of selflessness, and I 
would like to thank her on behalf 
of everyone who has been part of 
the University and stepped into 
your office.”

LSA and Engineering senior 

Will 
Royster 
said 
Stewart 

helped him believe in himself, 
particularly during difficult times.

“You have changed people’s 

lives for 42 years, and we couldn’t 
be more thankful for that,” 
Royster said.

has voted to not hold a cull,” 
Petersen said. “The arboretum is 
right next to Gallup, and if the cull 
happens in Gallup and the deer 
run into the arb, they are then off 
limits, so how effective would the 

cull be if the arboretum is where 
the deer really live?”

The 
candidates 
addressed 

bike and pedestrian safety in 
Ann Arbor. Specifically, they 
discussed a 2010 ordinance that 
states Ann Arbor drivers must 
yield to pedestrians in areas 
where there are no traffic signals 
in place. 

Both 
candidates 
said 
the 

ordinance is not being enforced. 
To improve the situation, Lumm 
proposed increasing the number 
of police officers monitoring 
traffic. She pointed out that only 
three permanent police officers 
assigned to traffic and pedestrian 
safety.

‘U’ alum talks urban 
policy in New Orleans

Taubman College 
lecture explores 

relationship between 
planners, community 

By CAMY METWALLY

For the Daily

University 
alum 
Kristina 

Ford returned to the University 
on Friday to present Taubman 
College’s 
2015 
Distinguished 

Alumna 
Lecture. 
Titled 

“Implementing Public Policy: 
The Heart of the Matter,” her 
lecture 
examined 
challenges 

that often stem from a lack of 
communication between urban 
planners and policy makers.

During 
the 
lecture, 
she 

touched on her experiences as 
director of city planning in New 
Orleans and as chief of staff for 
New Orleans’ deputy mayor 
in charge of public facilities, 
infrastructure and community 
development.

According 
to 
Ford, 
the 

gap 
in 
policy 
plans 
and 

implementation 
stems 
from 

an inconsistency between the 
needs of communities and the 
focus of policy and government 
leaders. To bridge this chasm, 
she said an open discussion 
between 
both 
parties 
must 

occur to foster a better level of 
understanding.

“Planners know how to write 

good plans, but what we don’t 
pay much attention to, and never 
have, is figuring out how to get 
them implemented,” Ford said. 
“We ask much better questions 
of citizens once we get them 
in the room. What we have not 
been very good at is getting new 
people into the room. What we 
need is new life.”

She 
said 
elected 
officials 

frequently identify opportunities 
for improvement. However, she 
emphasized it is voters who 
drive change by choosing their 
representatives 
and 
bringing 

attention to areas of concern.

Rather than waiting for a 

catastrophe 
like 
Hurricane 

Katrina to strike and demand 
society’s 
attention, 
Ford 

presented an alternative scenario 
where people and government 
proactively work together to 
steer policy change.

“The person who’s in charge 

of trying to oversee rebuilding or 
even working with the plan has 
got to find a way to keep citizens 
interested enough that elected 
leaders stay interested,” Ford 
said. “Otherwise, their impulse 
is to wash their hands of it and 
go on to the next thing.”

The combination of vocal 

citizens, capable planners and 
receptive leaders plays a role 
in effective policy changes. In 
2006, the Bring New Orleans 
Back strategic plan was rejected 
almost 
immediately. 
Ford 

said this was an example of 

the leadership’s failure to pay 
attention to the public.

The 
plan 
included 
newly 

designated 
areas 
for 
park 

land 
and 
paths 
to 
connect 

these features. However, after 
widespread devastation, citizens 
were most concerned with being 
displaced and feared relocation. 
Instead of working through 
concerns, as officials claimed 
would happen, the plan was 
simply discarded.

“What will we have to do? If 

the Bring New Orleans Back plan 
had asked and answered this 
question, New Orleans might 
now be the sustainable city it 
once was,” Ford said. “Instead, 
what New Orleans ultimately 
decided to do was build the city 
as it had been before Hurricane 
Katrina. Implementation seemed 
easy.”

Richard Norton, chair of the 

University’s urban and regional 
planning program, said people 
tend to consider urban planning 
and design when change is 
needed after a disaster, such as 
in New Orleans after Katrina.

“When everything’s working, 

nobody pays attention to it, 
and they take it for granted,” 
Norton said in an interview 
after the event. “Urban design 
and planning are more quiet 
professions. They happen in the 
background, but they profoundly 
influence the way people live 
their lives and how the landscape 
gets built around them.”

A missed opportunity

H

umans 
are 
essentially 

animals. About 2 million 
years ago, the original 

Homo 
moved 

about the Earth 
in 
search 
of 

food, water and 
sex as well as 
protection from 
predators 
and 

environmen-
tal disasters in 
order to survive. 
One can picture 
the 
proverbial 

“caveman” with 
a wooden club, 
making utterances in some inde-
cipherable language, roaming for 
necessities and warring for survival.

Of course, Homo exhibited traits 

outside of primal functioning, too 
— making fire, doing cave art, wear-
ing “jewelry” and creating more 
complex tools. These abilities distin-
guished humans as sociable learners 
who used symbols to help explain 
their relation to others and their 
own existence.

But from this cognitive develop-

ment, where did love evolve? Did 
the ability to love stem from our 
neurological complexity or from 
a selfish desire to survive through 
 

sexual reproduction?

To provide a framework for this 

question, we need to consider why we 
have sex. This isn’t such a straight-
forward answer — many organisms 
reproduce asexually. If we were to 
asexually reproduce, we’d pass on 
100 percent of our genes. As every 
biology and anthropology student 
and one Richard Dawkins knows, 
propagating genes is an organism’s 
No. 1 goal in life.

So why do we only pass on 50 per-

cent of our precious genetic materi-
al? Turns out, combining our genes 
with others creates more variability 
in the gene pool, thereby increasing 
an organism’s chances for survival. 
Much of this understanding rests on 
the “Red Queen Effect,” stating that 
sexually 
reproducing 
organisms 

constantly adapt to evade co-evolv-
ing microbes, parasites and envi-
ronmental changes. This is why you 
have to get the flu shot each year — 
there’s always a new evolving strain 
that we have yet to develop immuni-
ty to. Still, explaining why and how 
we pass on genetic material doesn’t 

explain the passion, intimacy and 
longing we feel in romantic love.

What’s going on cognitively, 

emotionally and physiologically to 
induce love? Why do we reach the 
most extreme version of care, devo-
tion and intimacy? And why does 
our world shatter when we lose it?

To begin, I must admit that love 

is complex; it initiates a swath of 
chemical reactions in several places 
of the brain. Nonetheless, there are 
regions that are activated more than 
others, particularly when it affects 
one’s motivation, attachment and 
holistic lifestyle.

According 
to 
anthropologist 

Helen Fisher, during intense peri-
ods of romantic love, activity in 
your ventral tegmental area and 
caudate nucleus illuminate. This 
part of your brain is associated with 
routine tasks (like muscle memory) 
but also one’s reward (or limbic) 
system. When romanticism exists, 
dopamine is triggered in this area, 
sparking prolonged desires, focused 
attention and exhilaration. But the 
caudate nucleus is associated with 
learning and memory, which means 
that this dopamine reaction perme-
ates all aspects of life.

This idea is corroborated in David 

Brooks’ book, “The Social Animal.” 
In it, Brooks discusses psychologist 
Arthur Aron’s idea of love, unlike 
happiness or sadness, as a moti-
vational state, leading to euphoria 
or misery. That is, depending on 
whether you’ve just had a first kiss 
or are mending a broken heart, your 
performance in a wide range of 
activities will be affected.

Additionally, that motivational 

state can often become an obsession. 
Psychologists like to call this feeling 
“limerence,” or the state of being 
involuntary infatuated with anoth-
er person, hoping for a reciprocal 
response. Neurologically, this phe-
nomenon also rests in one’s reward 
system. Cocaine is said to trigger the 
same responses as love.

But why do we maintain love with 

just one person? Fisher discusses 
three chemicals — serotonin, dopa-
mine and norepinephrine — that 
become associated with one person 
in order to stir romantic passions. In 
comparison with lust, one’s sexual 
desire can be satiated from a broad-
er inclusion of people. In short, lov-
ing one person creates an emotional 

pull unlike any other.

Furthermore, one personal con-

nection becomes more salient in 
terms of attachment. An attach-
ment is driven by hormones like 
oxytocin, which creates feelings 
of peace, serenity and calmness. 
After months of a relationship, two 
people become enmeshed with 
one another, thereby developing 
 

deep attachments.

Dr. Fisher states that after you 

“feel deep attachment to an indi-
vidual … you feel intense energy, 
intense focus, intense motivation 
and the willingness to risk it all to 
win life’s greatest prize.”

Love induces addictive, with-

drawal and relapse qualities. In 
other words, it’s a drug.

Of course, as many drugs do, 

love maintains terrible lows that 
often accompany its highs — like in 
a breakup. It would be easy if you 
could forget and remove the feelings 
once held for the person you loved, 
but you can’t erase your memories. 
The limbic system doesn’t forget. 
Instead, after being dumped, the 
reward system for wanting, craving, 
motivation and focus become more 
active when you can’t get what you 
want most. 

Personally, as someone who’s 

fallen in love, dumped someone 
and been dumped, I’ve experienced 
love’s euphoria and misery. And, like 
many others, I’ve found myself in 
each situation all at once.

Yet, for the emotional intensity 

that is a first date, breakup or inti-
mate conversation, I believe we’re 
made better by our capacity to love. 
It’s deeply imbued with the pas-
sion that we personify as people, 
animating every aspect of our lives, 
whether we want it to or not. It also 
provides an incredible opportu-
nity for learning. What better way 
to learn more about yourself, your 
partner or other people around you 
than through deep vulnerability and 
effusive intimacy?

Still, I can’t say for sure why love 

has evolved in humans. Maybe it’s 
helped us propagate our genes, deter 
war, share resources or just break 
the mundane routine. Regardless, 
it’s arguably one of the most distin-
guishing qualities of our species.

Why do we love?

COREY

We want to begin by thanking 

University President Mark Schlis-
sel for taking faculty concerns 
around transparency and fairness 
seriously enough to commission a 
review of executive pay on campus.

The University hired Sibson, 

a private consulting company, to 
carry out that review and its report 
was released last week. The main 
finding of the report is that the Uni-
versity’s top administrators receive 
pay and other compensation that’s 
at the very top among peer public 
institutions and at the median of 
top private universities.

This contrasts sharply (some-

thing the report does not point out) 
with the salary and compensation 
for faculty and staff, which mir-
rors those prevailing at our public 
research university peers, such 
as the University of California, 
Berkeley; University of California, 
Los Angeles; and the University of 
Virginia. Moreover, unlike most 
of our public-university peers, but 
like most private universities, the 
University does not disclose the 
extent of the supplemental pay 
 

employees receive.

We would like to provide some 

historical context for this trend 
toward a widening gulf between 
compensation for the top layers of 
the administration and ordinary fac-
ulty and staff. In April 2014, a group 
of faculty published an open letter 
questioning the runaway growth of 
both base and supplemental execu-
tive pay (bonuses) at the University. 

This letter documented not only the 
discrepancy between executive pay 
and the salaries of ordinary faculty 
and staff, but also the disproportion-
ate growth in executive pay vis-à-vis 
staff pay over the previous decade.

Between 2005 and 2013, base 

executive pay (that is, without fac-
toring in bonuses) grew at almost 
twice the rate of that of faculty and 
staff. That disparity resulted in 
base compensations for top execu-
tives that by 2013 were between 30 
percent and 40 percent higher than 
at top public research universities 
such as UCLA, Berkeley, UVA, and 
the University of Texas at Austin.

Meanwhile, faculty salaries at 

the University were almost perfect-
ly aligned with those institutions. 
Compounding the already high 
level of administrative pay was (and 
is) a culture of bonuses common 
among the highest layers of the 
administration. The letter focused 
on four main categories of supple-
mental pay and found that those 
categories had more than quadru-
pled between 2004 and 2013. These 
bonuses were not reserved for top 
executives, but they were granted 
much more generously in some 
offices than in others. The conclu-
sion of that letter was not to request 
an increase in faculty compensa-
tion, but rather to call for greater 
transparency and more sensible 
management of the executive pay 
scale in times of escalating tuition 
costs and shrinking state support.

It is thus with great regret that 

we have learned that Schlissel 
had decided to accept Sibson’s 
recommendation to preserve the 
status quo. We acknowledge that 
the University remains at the same 
crossroads as many other top public 
institutions, which are also facing 
pressures toward the adoption of 
corporate practices in the name 
of competition. Nonetheless, we 
hoped that our school would claim 
its place as a leader in forming a new 
future in public higher education.

In that spirit, we continue to ask 

that the University to disclose the 
full extent of executive pay as a ges-
ture of good faith. By the report’s 
own reckoning, 50 percent of the 
public universities with which Sib-
son Consulting compared the Uni-
veristy disclose both base pay and 
bonuses. Another 15 percent dis-
close the total pay, not differentiat-
ing between base and supplemental 
compensation. The University is 
therefore with the remaining 35 
percent of peer public institutions 
that do neither and disclose only 
the base pay.

We should be leading in the pro-

cess of the renewal of public higher 
education. Increasing pay transpar-
ency is a small gesture, but small 
gestures can send powerful signals.

t’s all but impossible to calculate the 
finite value of an education. At my mid-
dle-class high school in Michigan, one 

of the biggest pitches that 
teachers and administra-
tors made to try and con-
vince more of my peers to 
attend college relied purely 
on economics.

“College 
grads 
make 

more,” they said.

While that may typical-

ly be true, the fluctuating 
economy and subsequent 
job market doesn’t make 
attending a four-year uni-
versity a sure bet. Laying 
thousands of dollars on the table just to get a 
job can even seem paradoxical. Borrow money 
to pay for school, get a job, profit. Then pay the 
money back.

But universities shouldn’t be seen as manu-

facturers of employees. Students shouldn’t 
look back after graduation and weigh the cost 
of a college against the job prospects they were 
able to line up by their first month as an alum.

Education benefits society as a whole. No 

one’s chances of finding a job would improve if 
everyone in America held a bachelor’s degree, 
but the way our country would operate cul-
turally and politically would transform and 
for the better.

For example, Pamela Brandwein, a politi-

cal science professor here at the University, 
wrote a book on reinterpreting Reconstruc-
tion-era politics and history after the Civil 
War. Some of her work has been especially 
relevant this year.

After the Charleston church shooting in 

June, the nation entered a discussion about 
the Confederate flag. South Carolina law-
makers, and the nation, debated the flag’s 
meaning; one side claiming it as a symbol of 
Southern heritage, while others passionately 
bemoaned against the state’s use of a flag that 
stood for a nation founded upon acute racism 
and slavery.

In a resoundingly American fashion, we 

couldn’t even agree on what the ol’ stars and 
bars represent. The Civil War has been over 
for nearly one and a half centuries, but we 
haven’t been able to reach a consensus on 
what it was about. 

I remember being taught (shout out public 

school) that the Civil War was about slavery. I 
also remember being taught that this was too 
simple of a summation, that slavery was the 
big issue, but really state’s rights were what 
was on the line for the Confederacy.

And then I entered Brandwein’s class, and 

I re-learned two things. First, yes the Civil 
War was indeed fought over slavery, period. 
The prevailing sentiment in the South was 
that slavery was an institution of the utmost 
importance because the unlimited source 
of free labor was supposed to be the corner-
stone upon which a Southern utopia (for white 
folks) was built.

Secondly, political forces have the power to 

reshape history and affect our cultural under-
standing of it for decades and generations to 
come. After the Civil War, the loudest and 
most boisterous pro-slavery guys recognized 
a sinking ship when they were standing on it 
and began the line of rhetoric about states’ 

rights as the cause for the war. Unfortunately, 
they were successful, and this incorrect inter-
pretation of history still exists around high 
school classrooms and water coolers today.

Thanks, professor, for clearing that up.
Brandwein isn’t the first scholar, historian 

or journalist to pin down the truth about slav-
ery and the Civil War. But in the public, we 
still see its significance as something that’s up 
for debate. To drive a point home, anyone who 
believes the Civil War wasn’t a war about slav-
ery is wrong. But the truth, though made rela-
tively accessible to undergraduates here and at 
other universities, isn’t as easy to come across 
in the real world.

Society has entered full-force into the infor-

mation age, and everyone is surrounded by 
accessible data. While there’s a lot of good that 
comes from this, there are now more channels 
than ever to launch a marketing campaign to 
sway public opinion. The ability of self-inter-
ested actors to control what story gets told in 
the newspapers and on TV has made it incred-
ibly difficult to find out what is really going on.

Pick an issue: Black Lives Matter, Occupy 

Wall Street, Detroit’s bankruptcy — it doesn’t 
matter. Each person and each news outlet 
frames things differently. And there have 
been countless cases where powerful people 
have lied to the public with their own motives 
in mind. 

“I am not a crook,” said Richard Nixon.
Even with the brightest minds examining 

an event, like with the Civil War example, lies 
and political spin can slip past American com-
mon sense and become, for better or, more 
often, worse, part of what we accept as fact. 
We then carry on with an incorrect under-
standing of what is true and what happened.

Knowing this, the high volume of lies and 

political pandering should cause anyone 
from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore., to 
think more critically about the information 
 

they consume.

In an educated society, we would all have 

the skills to at least do this. Making more 
people college graduates benefits the greater 
good. A college education exposes each person 
to perspectives, ideas and concepts they oth-
erwise may not have stumbled upon. Students 
absorb all of this information and take it with 
them to parties, coffee shops and, eventually, 
society in some form or another.

In a time where privilege is defined by 

access to opportunity, being educated turns 
over a blank page for new ideas and ways of 
thinking. If more people had access to educa-
tion, it could aid in turning the echo cham-
ber of social media unoriginality, bias and 
uninformed public opinion into something 
more symphonic. And more importantly, it 
undercuts the ability of politicians and billion-
aires to sell their own versions of history and 
manipulate the masses into acting or believing 
certain ways.

Above all else, receiving an education may 

not get you a job, but it can provide some 
direction amid all the chaos and half the pro-
duction of lemmings (the video game people, 
not the animals). Because as the late, great 
Yogi Berra said, “If you don’t know where you 
are going, you’ll wind up someplace else.”

TV COLUMN

‘You’re the Worst’ and 
my quarter-life crisis
I 

feel old. I realize that’s 
a ridiculous thing to say 
— objectively, I’m a very 

young person. I’m 21, my skin 
is smooth (and still as oily as a 
teenager’s); 
I know what 
Yik Yak is; 
I can guilt-
lessly indulge 
in late-night 
pizzas with-
out worrying 
about my 
jeans fit-
ting the next 
day. I watch 
young-person 
TV comedies that my dad 
would never really understand, 
like “Broad City” and “You’re 
the Worst.”

But I won’t be 21 for much 

longer. On the morning of Oct. 
12, the day this column will be 
published, the clock will strike 
10:38 and I’ll become a 22-year-
old crone. I’ll officially be older 
than the majority of my friends 
(many of them can’t get into 
bars yet), and I’ll officially be 
older than my father was when 
he got married. Twenty-two 
is a magical age, when many 
people get their first real job 
and move to a real city and 
meet real-adult-friends who 
drink real cocktails instead of 
cheap vodka with vanilla coke. 
I won’t reach any of these mile-
stones in my 22nd year — I’m 
planning on going to graduate 
school, so I’m looking forward 
to another six years in a col-
lege town, waiting to have suf-
ficient degrees for my life to 
actually start.

In the midst of my quarter-

life crisis, I’ve gotten really 
into FXX’s “You’re the Worst.” 
I was a fan when it first aired 
in 2014, but something always 
kept me from connecting emo-
tionally with the show. Objec-
tively, I was not “the worst.” I 
was a 20-year-old Midwestern 
girl who had never done drugs 
or thrown herself into a crazy, 
toxic relationship. None of 
this has changed a year later, 
but “You’re the Worst” has, an 
almost imperceptible bit. The 
show has the same biting wit 
and fearlessness and flawed 
characters that it always has, 
but with every week and every 
new episode, “You’re the 
Worst” pushes its characters 
further out of their immature 
idiot bubbles and into the real, 
grown-up world.

In the second episode of the 

season, “Crevasses,” Gretchen 
decides she’s sick of picking 
her outfits out of a black plastic 
garbage bag in Jimmy’s apart-
ment; she would like a drawer 
in Jimmy’s dresser and for him 
to acknowledge the fact that 
they are actually living togeth-
er and sharing that space. She 
boldly states that she’s going to 
“Towels & Things” to buy some 
stuff that she didn’t steal or 
scam her way into possessing. 
She is going to be a real human 
who buys towels at a store, god-
damn it.

Except she can’t do it. When 

Gretchen arrives at the store, 
she freezes a few feet from 
the door. She makes several 
attempts to walk inside, but 
immediately reroutes to the 
same spot she stood in a few 
minutes ago — it’s like she’s on 

the high dive at the town swim-
ming pool, and she suddenly 
remembered that some kid 
named Andrew did a belly flop 
off the high dive once, and he 
said it really hurt. Gretchen’s 
eyes show the familiar terror of 
a little kid who is realizing that 
this thing that is supposedly 
fun is actually scary as hell. 
She has to decide whether it’s 
worth it to just jump off and get 
it over with or to descend the 
ladder, rung by awkward rung.

I’ve never had trouble buying 

things at a home goods store, 
but this scene was painfully 
relatable to me. Every time I 
open up the website for a mas-
ter’s program application or the 
Word document for my thesis 
proposal, I snap my computer 
shut and leave it in my room 
for a few hours. Maybe if I 
ignore the problem and just 
leave things undone, I’ll never 
have to step up and actually do 
them. Being an adult is scary, 
because you have to make that 
conscious effort to start, and 
then somehow find the motiva-
tion and fearlessness to com-
plete the task. Gretchen wasn’t 
ready yet, and I’m not quite 
there either.

In another episode, Gretch-

en decides to throw a house 
party at Jimmy’s, and invites 
the crew of girlfriends she 
knows are always down for 
a crazy night. But when they 
arrive at the parties with 
babies and AA chips in tow, 
she realizes how much has 
changed in the three years 
since she’d last hung out with 
them. They’re real adults with 
responsibilities and real lives 
to go home to; their days of 
wild nights and cocaine are 
behind them. Meanwhile, 
Gretchen is stuck in the twi-
light zone of her early 20s. 
While she desperately search-
es for an age peer who still has 
the same priorities she does, 
she realizes that Jimmy, her 
live-in boyfriend, might be the 
only one who’s still there with 
her. And that’s fucking ter-
rifying.

The past few installments 

of “You’re the Worst” have 
ended with Gretchen sneaking 
out of Jimmy’s house in the 
middle of night, carrying only 
her jacket and a burner phone. 
I can’t guess what Gretchen is 
up to, but I know her behavior 
has something to do with the 
way she feels trapped by where 
she is in life.

Sometimes, I want to do 

the same. My friends who are 
already 22 have jobs and plans; 
I feel like there’s some thresh-
old to adulthood that people 
cross on their 22nd birthday, 
and as I get closer and closer 
to it, I realize there’s no way 
I’ll make it over in time. I 
don’t write my own checks. I 
never learned how to drive. 
I still haven’t learned any 
marketable skills aside from 
being good at turning essays 
in on time. But when I watch 
“You’re the Worst,” I feel a lit-
tle better about my situation, 
because I can see that other 
people are right here with me. 
There’s something valuable 
about having company in your 

misery, even if that company is 
fictional.

My dad, a fellow TV fanatic, 

has been recommending “Mar-
ried” and “Togetherness” to 
me for the better part of a year. 
For him, these are comedies 
imbued with pathos and a real 
sense of truth, a humor born 
out of middle-aged malaise 
that hits him in just the right 
place. They are also “the fun-
niest shows on TV,” according 
to someone who has never seen 
“Broad City.”

I tried watching 

“Togetherness” because I trust 
my dad’s good taste, but I just 
couldn’t relate in the same 
way. It was funny, but it relied 
on an emotional connection I 
just couldn’t make, because I 
haven’t been 40 years old yet. 
I haven’t felt the same kind 
of nostalgic ache for youth 
or mourned the decades I’ve 
already spent, and I’ve never 
suffered a nagging spouse. 
And that’s OK. One of the best 
things about living in this 
time of “peak TV” and having 
hundreds of quality shows to 
pick from is that there’s always 
somebody on a parallel track 
to you, someone you can follow 
and laugh at and think about 
after the show ends. There’s a 
point of connection for nearly 
everybody; TV offers points 
of view from a broader variety 
of races, cultures, sexualities 
and socioeconomic statuses all 
over the spectrum.

The show I’m connecting 

with at the moment is 
called “You’re the Worst.” 
Should I be concerned about 
what this says about my 
personality? Probably. But a 
Hulu subscription is cheaper 
than therapy, and I’m really 
enjoying this season. This 
show is made for lazy old 
babies like me, so shut up and 
let me have this.

FILM REVIEW
New doc explores the 
history of Lampoon

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

“So we all know why we came 

here,” John Belushi starts to 
say at the first meeting of The 
Lemmings 
in the 1970s, 
“A million of 
us. We came 
here 
to 
off 

ourselves.”

One of the 

first 
hugely 

popular 
— 

and 
majorly 

controversial 
— 
National 

Lampoon-
sponsored 
gags 
was 
a 

show 
called 

“The Lemmings.” John Belushi 
stood in front of a live audience 
and essentially talked about all 
the reasons why it makes sense 
for certain people in certain 
situations to kill themselves. 
The character was “manically 
agreeable,” noted one of the 
Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead 
interviewees, 
and 
in 
many 

ways he’s right: As we all sit 
and watch this absurd, slightly 
overweight, comic numbskull 
make fun of our collective 
tendency to overreact to things, 
we can’t help but laugh a little 
bit.

“The 
Lemmings” 
show 

featured 
many 
Lampoon 

writers and other guest stars, 
one of which was Chevy Chase. 
In part of his interview for the 
documentary, Chase recalls a 
bit between him and Belushi 
where they pretended to be 
two teenage friends standing 
at a urinal talking. Chase 
remembers 
some 
confusion 

he had about the audience’s 
incessant laughter at Belushi, 
and about a week into the 
routine, he realized what they 
were laughing at. As Chase 
pretended to hold his junk with 
his thumb and index finger, 
Belushi was using his whole 
hand.

This scene, among others, 

captures the National Lampoon 

magazine in its essence: It 
was the Internet before the 
Internet. Irreverent penis jokes 
were somehow thrown into a 
mix of self-deprecation, social 
commentary, 
theatricality, 

and it all seemed wonderfully 
strange and familiar, funny 
and appalling. Think about any 
YouTube 
comment 
section, 

4chan forum or Reddit thread 
— what do you see? A bunch 
of twisted goofball weirdos 
making 
overly 
insightful 

remarks about things of no 
consequence. 
The 
people 

behind National Lampoon did 
it first.

In fact, they did a lot of things 

first, and they did a lot of things 
really, really well. In the mid-
1970s, some of the early Lampoon 
writers like Belushi, Chase and 
Bill Murray entered conversations 
with a young man named Lorne 
Michaels about creating a live 
TV show that would offer new 
sketches every Saturday. That 
show was “Saturday Night Live.”

That same group of writers 

decided also to make a movie about 
the silliness and awkwardness of 
teenage romance and sex, a germ 
of an idea that ballooned into 
one of the most beloved comedy 
films of all time: “Animal House.” 
 

They also turned out a series of 
“Vacation” movies that still run 
constantly during the holidays.

Other writers like Al Jean 

and Mike Reiss knew they 
had screenwriting talent and 
wanted to try scripting for 
television. They found a job 
working for a quirky cartoonist 
named Matt Groening, who’d 
been running his cartoon about 
a dysfunctional family on the 
“Tracy Ullman Show” for several 
months. Reiss and Jean would 
become members of the original 
writing team that created “The 
Simpsons.”

Director Douglas Tirola does 

a good job of making these 
enormously important National 
Lampoon spin-offs subservient 
to the magazine that bore them. 
Tirola takes us in front of such 
varied talent as Kevin Bacon, 
Billy Bob Thornton and Meat 
Loaf to give us a sense of how 
National 
Lampoon’s 
humor 

infiltrated nearly every part 
of the entertainment industry. 
Comedy 
heavyweight 
and 

so-called genius Judd Apatow 
said it best: the people behind 
National Lampoon magazine 
became all of modern comedy.

Is “Drunk Stoned Brilliant 

Dead” a well-done, articulate 
and 
endearing 
documentary 

about 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 

magazines ever? Yes it is. Can 
a documentary ever do such a 
magazine and its people justice? 
Of course not. But it’s enough 
for this film to exist and satisfy 
viewers. Go and be entertained.

EVENT REVIEW
Sui recounts her life

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

The world of Anna Sui is ever-

evolving, 
consistently 
arresting 

and above all, unlike any other. For 
the past 34 years, the Detroit-born 
fashion designer has absorbed the 
intricacies of countless cultures 
and rendered them wearable, an 
approach best epitomized by her offi-
cial Instagram bio.

“I invite my friends around the 

world to share a peak into my mind,” 
it reads.

Last Thursday, a near-packed 

Michigan Theater caught a glimpse 
of Sui’s wordly psyche as she shared 
her story of breaking into the fashion 
industry, creating an enduring inter-
national brand and staying true to 
herself. As part of the Penny Stamps 
Speaker Series collaboration with 
The Institute for the Humanities and 
Detroit Creative Corridors Center 
(dc3), Sui spoke in a conversation for-
mat with Detroit-based fashion styl-
ist Paulina Petkoski. 

“We’re always happy when we 

can find people from the area who 
have gone on to find success,” said 
Chrisstina Hamilton, director of the 
speaker series. “She’s been so suc-
cessful internationally and across 
markets.”

Hamilton prefaced the discussion 

with a synopsis of the recent New 
York Times article by Guy Treaty, 
“When Fashion Shows Were Fun” 
— a wistful recount of the industry’s 
incipient years of playful spectacle, a 
far cry from today’s over-commer-
cialization. And yet, Treaty applauds 
Sui’s everlasting contingency on exu-
berance and lauds her as the high 
point of New York Fashion Week.

“Today, the most fun is always to 

be had at an Anna Sui show,” Hamil-
ton said. “Her collections take you on 
a journey that’s unparalleled in the 
fashion industry.”

Sui’s initial fashion fascination 

is a familiar tale — a childhood 
marked by lusting over the glossy 
pages of fashion magazines, adorn-
ing bedroom walls with captivat-
ing snippets and industry profiles. 
She recalled her formative years 

as a time of obsession for all things 
rock ‘n’ roll, television and of course, 
fashion — inspirations that continue 
to manifest into her collections.

“I think growing up in the sub-

urbs, I was just purely a product of 
pop culture,” Sui said. “As a kid you 
just think you have to find the magic 
key and I think, from that point on, I 
was really living my dream.”

Along with collaging her dream 

world, Sui diligently researched 
design schools and ultimately decid-
ed on Parsons School of Design in 
New York City, where she mingled 
with noted fashion photographer 
Steven Meisel, who remains a dear 
friend. Parsons also allowed her to 
break into the industry by way of 
eavesdropping.

“I overheard two seniors at Par-

sons talking about a job opportu-
nity when I was still a junior,” she 
recalled. “It was with my favorite 
designer Erika Elias’s line for Char-
lie’s Girls … so I took my portfolio 
over to see her and I got hired.”

Under Elias’s strict direction, Sui 

learned everything from sewing 
techniques to drape work. To this 
day, Elias’s mantra resonates — “if 
you’re talking, you’re not working.”

“She would say, ‘just inspire me, 

do what you want,’ ” Sui said. “She 
was a really tough boss, but I learned 
so much from her.”

Sui then went on to cultivate the 

decade-long foundation of her first 
collection. She took on various free-
lance jobs and spent seven years 
working on men’s collections in 
Italy, alongside bourgeoning design-
er Marc Jacobs.

 “He was just a young kid obsessed 

with fashion, the way I was obsessed 
with fashion,” she said. 

After an experiential education 

within the industry, Sui debuted her 
inaugural collection. Soon after, she 
took her first trip to Paris to observe 
Paris Fashion Week in action along-
side Meisel and a remaining slew of 
stylish companions. During their 
adventures, Sui and Meisel attend-
ed a Jean Paul Gaultier show with 
Madonna — an experience that lent 
her the confidence to keep pursuing 
her craft.

“We got to the show and she 

leaned over and said ‘Anna, I have 
a surprise for you’,” Sui said. “She 
opened up her coat and said ‘I’m 
wearing your dress!’ That was one 
of the big things that gave me confi-
dence.”

By 1992, Sui established her flag-

ship boutique in SoHo, the first of 50 
eponymous edifices. The decorum 
of red floors, purple walls, black lac-
quered furniture, paper maché dolls 
and all things art nouveau became 
longstanding Anna Sui motifs.

Though Sui’s work ethic speaks 

volumes to her success, she insists 
that a majority of her business ‘just 
happened’. Though it wasn’t always a 
straightforward path.

“Practically every penny I made 

went right back into the business,” 
she said. “As the business grows, you 
need more capital. It’s a hardship 
worrying about money all the time.”

She also refers to 2008’s finan-

cial crisis as a reality check for 
the fashion world, but believes 
it prompted an era of analyzing 
and strategy planning in the ever-
changing industry.

Perils aside, Sui believes she has 

the best job in the world. Her knack 
for translating any facet of the cur-
rent zeitgeist, whether it be modern 
phenomena or her recent travels, is 
positively uncanny. She absorbs the 
essence of everything from Victo-
rian cowboys to her recent Tahitian 
travels and stunningly refracts it.

“I think the thing I love most is 

the research, it’s kind of like my con-
tinuing education,” she said.

To those aspiring a fashion-centric 

career, Sui stressed the importance of 
travelling and the willingness to relo-
cate, two markers of her own career. 
Her idiosyncratic aesthetic has also 
helped her elevate her business.

“You can never tell if it’s for a good 

girl or a bad girl,” she said. “I think 
that’s part of the appeal.”

For those who were unable to 

attend the lecture or Sui’s tropical 
SS16 show in New York, a sample of 
her distinctive clothing is on display 
at the Detroit Historical Museum as 
part of the Booth-Wilkinson Gallery 
exhibit, Fashion D.Fined.

‘AHS’ still not boring

ALBUM REVIEW

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

Say what you will about 

“American Horror Story,” but it’s 
never been boring.

With 

“Hotel,” 
the 

horror anthol-
ogy once more 
stages an all-
out 
assault 

of every con-
ceivable 
vice, 

repression and 
dirty 
thought, 

even if the final 
product 
isn’t 

perfect.

Though the show has yet to 

achieve the poetic transcen-
dence of the grotesque that 
elevated “Hannibal” into a mas-
terpiece, it nonetheless creates a 
fascinating universe. Like all of 
“AHS,” “Hotel” is undoubtedly 
heightened, painting its world 
with distorted lenses and a dark, 
velveteen-hued palette.

“Hotel,” like its predecessors, 

relishes in the perverse. The 
look and feel of the Hotel Cortez 
— the true main character of the 
show — can best be described 
as a fetish club, operating in an 
alternate dimension and run by 
the staff of the Overlook Hotel 
from “The Shining.” If “Hanni-

bal” was about making the grue-
some seem beautiful, “Hotel” 
defiles the sacred, daring the 
viewer with sadistic glee to keep 
watching.

“AHS” is not pleasant, and 

many viewers will likely be 
turned off by the show’s utter 
lack of compassion. It’s also a 
little hard not to be distracted 
by Lady Gaga, who never really 
disappears into her character to 
the extent of someone like Denis 
O’ Hare (“True Blood”). Though 
viewers will come for Gaga, but 
it’s character actors like O’Hare 
who give the show its sense of 
identity. The “AHS” regular 
plays a cross-dressing front desk 
worker named Liz Taylor, who 
leaves as equal an impression 
silently reading a copy of “Ulyss-
es” as Gaga does in entire scenes 
of dialogue. The rest of the cast 
seems to be retreads of charac-
ters from previous seasons, but 
the amount of fun Kathy Bates 
(“Misery”), Lily Rabe (“The 
Whispers”) and Sarah Paul-
son (“12 Years a Slave”) have 
onscreen is infectious.

The majority of the story is 

beyond insanity, and it’s this 
commitment to the absurd that 
saves the show. Falchuk and 
Murphy’s style is like “Twin 
Peaks” and “Rocky Horror Pic-
ture Show” had a baby that 
was adopted by horror direc-
tors Dario Argento and James 
Wan. The whole thing’s so pulpy 
and melodramatic, yet so oth-
erworldly, you forgive it for its 
transgressions, at least for now.

The problem with “AHS” 

always ends up being its prog-
ress as the season goes on. Sea-
son one is often praised for being 
tied, even if by a thread, to the 
reality of the present. However, 
despite some of the hate thrown 
at it, season two (“Asylum”) 
remains the most memorable. 
It was this season that threw 
out the preoccupation with the 
real world and delivered some-
thing that felt more like music, 
with characters being played 
like power chords rather than 
human beings. 

Edward Sharpe live

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

In my head, Edward Sharpe & 

the Magnetic Zeros aren’t just a 
band, but actually a nomadic tribe 
that 
travels 

from fantastical 
forest clearing 
to 
fantastical 

forest clearing. 
This is where 
they make their 
music 
circles, 

and I picture a 
lot of handmade 
percussion 
instruments 
floating in the 
air 
around 

them and that 
they’re 
mysti-

cally 
glowing 

orbs of light. No 
one has show-
ered in months, 
so everyone smells like a mixture of 
body, river water (that they bathe in) 
and wildflowers (that they sleep in), 
and this is exactly how it should be 
— the inevitable outcome of this life 
that can be chaotic and hectic and 
also undeniably beautiful, as long as 
we stay in it together.

In fact, they aren’t just a band; 

they’re a music collective made 
up of two core musicians, founder 
Alex Ebert and Jade Castrinos, and 
up to 12 other members. Whether 
this qualifies them as a tribe or not, 
it seems to go without saying that 
their music is basically made to be 
played live, which is why their latest 
release, Live In No Particular Order: 
2009-2014, is absolutely a dream. 
It takes songs from all three of the 
band’s albums, played from 2009, 
when their first album came out, 
to 2014, after their third and most 
recent album came out.

My first particularly memorable 

encounter with Edward Sharpe and 
the Magnetic Zeros was in 2010; I’d 
just started freshman year of high 
school and the group’s debut album 
Up From Below, featuring the uni-

versally beloved “Home,” had come 
out a year earlier. Knowing this 
song had gained the confidence of a 
junior I idolized — she was alterna-
tive, cool, but unbelievably open, and 
seemed to always be in touch with 
the real magic of life: love and com-
munity. She seemed to emanate the 
Ed Sharpe mindset, taking a gap year 
between high school and college to 
live in a sustainable farm community.

I found it no surprise that her 

Spotify profile showed her listen-
ing to Live in No Particular Order at 
the same time I was, the day it was 
released.

The album opens with “Better 

Days,” a track from their most recent 
album, unexpectedly titled Edward 
Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. This 
song is a nod to hope and should 
be everyone’s go-to on a bad day. It 
speaks of how we all go through bad 
times, but what the hell: “down with 
history, up with your head,” because 
“we might still know sorrow, but we 
got better days.” For me those words 
mean we got better days in the sense 
that we got days actually better than 
the ones we’re living now, but also 
that we got this song, “Better Days.” 
In this sense, even if the future 
doesn’t look up right away we have 
this song, music itself and the ability 
to feel with others.

Up next is the only record-

ing from 2009, an NPR Tiny Desk 
recording of “40 Day Dream,” which 
is the first track on their first album 
— a little celebration of beginnings 
and a drop of honey for longtime 
fans who can appreciate the context. 

Then there’s the famed “Home,” 

which has over 100 million plays on 
Spotify and which the group man-
ages to perform four years after its 
release with just as much zealous 
love and enthusiasm as if they were 
singing it live for the first time. They 
do this despite the fact that the rela-
tionship between Jade and Alex 
eventually ended; now, instead of 
being romantic partners, the two 
are simply great friends and artistic 
partners. This time, during the part 
of the song where Jade and Alex usu-

ally tell the story of Jade falling out 
of Alex’s window and he was falling 
“deep, deeply in love,” the pair had 
members of the audience come up 
to the stage and tell their own sto-
ries of being home whenever they’re 
with one another, whether the love 
is romantic, platonic or familial.

The last actual song on the live 

album is “All Wash Out,” which 
is the closing song of their 2012 
album Here. It’s a solid minute-and-
a-half longer, the time filled with 
added harmonies and hums from 
both Jade and other members of 
the band, and also with a final clap 
session from the crowd to go along 
with the gentle beat of the song. 
Dreamy instrumentals are made up 
of gentle strums on both the acoustic 
and electric guitar, trumpet, piano 
and a variety of drums, snaps and 
whistles. The added vocals and the 
already multilayered instrumentals 
(all played live) contribute to the 
communal feel of the song and the 
entire album thus far.

Though much of the group’s work 

focuses on maintaining hope and 
lightheartedness through the chaos of 
life, a lot of onerous and intense emo-
tion has obviously gone into creating 
all of this music, showing that the 
musicians may not only be remind-
ing listeners to stay uplifted, but 
reminding themselves as well. It 
only seems appropriate that this last 
song tells us to “let it all wash out ... in 
the rain.” It’s as if the musicians are 
telling themselves to let themselves 
be cleansed of the emotion in all of 
those live performances, but also 
telling their audience to do the same.

This sense of togetherness is 

perfectly encapsulated in the last 
track, which isn’t a song but simply 
a recording of a collection of noises, 
voices, accidental strums and nudg-
es on the drums that were filling 
the air, presumably before or after 
a show. It’s called “All Together – 
Live,” and is the only track without 
a time or place in its title. Instead it’s 
simply about being together at a live 
performance: the band, the audi-
ence, all together.

FILM REVIEW
‘Malala’ nothing new

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

For The Daily

“This is Malala Yousafzai, 

she is the naughtiest girl in the 
world.”

The teenage 

activist’s 
brother 
says 

this to tease 
her, 
but 
for 

some in her 
home country 
of 
Pakistan, 

the sentiment 
holds 
true 

— 
she 
was 

“naughty” 
enough to be 
targeted by the Taliban. Malala 
became a household name in 2012 
when she was shot on her way to 
school, following a decision by 
Taliban leaders outlawing the 
education of girls. Since then, she 
has become a leading advocate 
for human rights and equal 
education for women. In 2014, she 
became the youngest recipient of 
the Nobel Peace Prize. Through 
numerous television appearances, 
speeches, and her autobiography 
“I Am Malala,” the generalities 
of her story have become well 
known in the Western world. 

Davis 
Guggenheim’s 
(“An 

Inconvenient 
Truth”) 
latest 

documentary, “He Named Me 
Malala,” tries to break past the 
public image of “Malala” to 
the teenage girl underneath. 
However, the film comes across 
as an hour and a half episode 
of “60 Minutes,” scratching a 
surface that has already been 
scratched. Malala is powerful, 
and the work she is doing for girls 
around the world is inspiring, 
that seems to be all we get from 
the film. 

Malala’s relationship with her 

father is central to the film and 
provides the possibility for some 
more depth and provocation. 
The film’s title alludes to the 
formative 
role 
her 
father, 

Ziauddin Yousafzai, plays in her 
activism. In Pakistan, Yousafzai 
was a school owner and education 
activist, who, as we learn in the 

opening animated scene, named 
his daughter after a woman who 
used her voice to inspire her 
country to fight for what they 
thought was right. He was a vocal 
activist for education equality 
in Pakistan, making it on the 
Taliban’s list before his daughter. 
The question looming over their 
relationship is: How much did 
her father influence, or even push, 
her into this type of activism? It’s 
a question hinted at and skirted 
around 
throughout 
the 
film. 

The pursuit of its answer would 
provide “He Named Me Malala” 
with the depth it so desperately 
needs. 

What Guggenheim does capture 

is the stark contrast between 
Malala’s age and her role in the 
world. In one scene, she is shown 
laughing at clips from “Despicable 
Me” on YouTube, but is interrupted 
by a phone interview in which she 
is asked about death threats from 
the Taliban. Minions and murder 
aren’t supposed to exist in the 

same world, but for Malala they 
do. What is the toll of her type of 
activism? We know Malala suffers 
physically for her beliefs, but is 
she suffering emotionally as well? 
The film hints at these questions, 
but unfortunately decides not to 
answer.

Guggenheim isn’t one to shy 

away from controversy in his 
films. His 2010 film “Waiting 
for Superman” criticized the 
American Public School system 
by 
asking 
tough 
questions 

and 
seeking 
answers. 
“An 

Inconvenient 
Truth” 
sought 

to find the, well, inconvenient 
truth about global warming and 
greenhouse gases. Both films 
prompted debate and discussion 
in a way “He Named Me Malala” 
does not. Perhaps that is because 
Guggenheim’s 
latest 
film 
is 

targeted at a different, younger 
audience. He seems to spend a 
good amount of time telling the 
audience, “Hey, look, Malala is 
just like you!” She fights with 
her brothers, she teaches her dad 
how to tweet and she even fails 
the occasional biology test. In 
that way, “He Named Me Malala” 
works as a YA documentary, 
aimed at an audience too young 
to already know her story.

“He 
Named 
Me 
Malala” 

provides a wonderful role model 
for young audiences, but doesn’t 
give many answers for viewers in 
search of the human behind the 
media phenomenon.

FOX SEARCHLIGHT

We can’t say anything mean! Malala is too good!

Yousafzai is the

A little more than one

A

round 7:30 p.m. Saturday, 
Jim Harbaugh sat at a 

table inside 
Crisler Center 
and spoke 
about the 
identity of 
his Michigan 
football 
team at his 
postgame 
press 
conference.

“It’s a 

good sign, that you’re building 
a good callus,” Harbaugh said. 
“Play physical and not get beat 
up yourself. That’s a good gauge, 
probably the best gauge.”

Some 600 miles away, in 

Piscataway, Michigan State was 
nearing its 8 p.m. kickoff against 
Rutgers. After the Spartans won, 
coach Mark Dantonio said in his 
postgame press conference: “I 
can’t ever fault the effort of our 
players and how hard they play 
or their toughness.”

Sound familiar?
Over time, all great programs 

in college football establish an 
identity that opponents have 
in their minds when they take 
the field. Alabama has been a 
well-oiled machine in every 
phase of the game, lining up 
and dominating teams from the 
outset. Oregon and Baylor seek 
to push the tempo, pile up points 
and run opponents off the field. 
Harbaugh’s old team, Stanford, 
has kept its identity since he left: 
a hard-nosed, physical, blue-
collar football team.

And yes, Michigan State 

has an identity, too. Dantonio 
has spent years building a 
powerhouse in East Lansing, one 
that works harder, acts tougher 
and plays more physically 
than its opponent. He has 
constructed an elite defense that 
powers the team’s success.

Sound familiar?
If it does, it’s because that’s 

the identity Harbaugh is 
working toward at Michigan. He 
wants a tough-minded, physical 
team that will win the battle at 
the line of scrimmage, using that 
to control both sides of the ball.

In the last five weeks, the 

Wolverines have done that. They 
have done enough on offense, 
kept their opponents from doing 
anything on defense and in the 
end won all five by a combined 
score of 160-14.

Each week, Harbaugh has 

taken major steps toward to 
build the identity he wants his 
team to have. Saturday, we find 
out how far that process has 
come.

The Wolverines face a team 

that, in each of the past two 
years, has done to them exactly 
what they have done to Oregon 
State, UNLV, Brigham Young, 
Maryland and Northwestern — 
dominate on both sides of the 
ball.

In those two games against 

Michigan State, Michigan 
averaged 12.5 first downs, 201 
total yards, 420 total yards 
allowed, 7.5 tackles for loss 
allowed and a 49.1 completion 
percentage. Average scoring 
margin: minus-23.5.

Its opponents, in the past 

five games this season: 11 first 
downs, 150.2 total yards, 397.6 
total yards 
allowed, 7.6 
tackles for 
loss allowed 
and a 48.2 
completion 
percentage. 
Average 
scoring 
margin: 
minus-29.2.

Put simply, 

2015 Michigan looks similar to 
2013 Michigan State at times. 
We’ll find out how similar they 
are on Saturday.

You hate to put such high 

stakes on one game — especially 

in October — but this one feels 
bigger. If Michigan knocks 
off Michigan State in the Big 
House on Saturday, Harbaugh’s 
rebuilding process is much 
further along than anyone 
could have expected, and as a 
bonus, the Wolverines are in the 
driver’s seat in the Big Ten race.

If Saturday goes like the past 

two years, well, then that’s two 
steps forward and one step back. 
In 2008, after Dantonio beat 
Michigan for the first time, he 
said, “this one counts a little 
more than one.”

The coaches will deny that 

this week, but the game this 
year feels that way, too. Before 
the season, no one could have 
predicted the Wolverines would 
have an opportunity like this. 
Not only are they rolling into 
the rivalry game next weekend, 
but the Spartans are reeling. 
They scored a late touchdown 
against woeful Rutgers on 
Saturday, slipping by only when 
the Scarlet Knights spiked the 
ball on fourth down in the final 
seconds. Their defense, which 
has been one of the nation’s 
best in recent years, ranks 34th 
against the run, 88th against 
the pass and 55th in points 
allowed. They haven’t been this 
vulnerable in years.

And, for the first time in 

three years, 
the game is 
at Michigan 
Stadium. The 
Wolverines 
literally have 
their in-state 
rivals right 
where they 
want them.

Harbaugh 

has been 

reluctant to give the Spartans 
any bulletin-board material 
ahead of Saturday. In May, 
more than three months before 
he coached his first game at 
Michigan, Harbaugh praised 

the job Dantonio has done at 
Michigan State.

“We know we’re not the 

biggest guy on the block — 
Michigan State’s the biggest 
guy,” he told a group of high 
school coaches in Detroit. “They 
have done a tremendous job. We 
respect the job they’ve done, but 
we want to be that.”

In six weeks, Harbaugh has 

done some of what Dantonio 
did in his first three years 
at Michigan State. As much 
as each school tries to gain 
an edge on the other, and as 
different as the two coaches’ 
backgrounds are (Harbaugh 
a former Michigan and NFL 
quarterback, Dantonio a former 
South Carolina defensive back), 
they have almost the exact 

same opinion on how to run a 
football team.

That includes maintaining 

an even keel, no matter the 
result, reaching toward their 
ultimate goal. Saturday, 
after they coached two very 
different games — Harbaugh an 
impressive rout, Dantonio an 
uninspiring escape — they both 
faced similar questions about 
facing the other this week.

“Tremendous opponent,” 

Harbaugh said. “It’s going to 
demand that we’re at our very 
best. That’s going to mean a 
great week of preparation and 
practice is in store for us. So 
we’ll move on even more quickly 
than usual, because it is such 
a good, worthy opponent next 
week. And we’ll be looking 

forward to it.”

This time, their responses 

weren’t similar.

“I’m going to just delay 

that response and focus on 
the present,” Dantonio said. 
“Getting on the plane, going 
home and making plans and 
looking for things we need to get 
better at and worry about our 
football team.”

And so the chess match 

began. Both coaches have had 
success, and both have won 
big games. Both will go about 
preparing their teams as they 
see fit. Saturday brings the 
ultimate measuring stick.

Michigan takes third 
at Yale Intercollegiate

White shooots 
70-71-70 to lead 

Wolverines

By BILLY STAMPFL

For the Daily

Of all the words Michigan 

women’s 
golf 
coach 
Jan 

Dowling could have used to 
describe 
sophomore 
Emily 

White’s performance at the 
Yale Women’s Intercollegiate, 
where Michigan claimed third 
overall out of 16 teams and 
White captured the individual 
championship, 
“imagination” 

was the first that popped into 
her head.

“This course requires a lot of 

imagination around the greens,” 
Dowling said. “And (White) 
really used her imagination to 
hit some great shots and execute 
them really well.”

White, a top performer from 

the 
Wolverines’ 
successful 

weekend, remained consistent 
throughout all three rounds 
of the tournament, shooting a 
70, 71 and 70. The sophomore, 
frustrated 
early 
with 
her 

putting, showed resilience and 
patience in letting other shots 
carry her until the putts began 
to fall.

“I was playing well all week, 

my putts just weren’t dropping,” 
White said. “I knew that if I 
kept hitting big shots eventually 
… something was going to 
happen.”

Something did happen as 

White, down four strokes in 
singles competition after the 
second round, came roaring 
back to tie Clemson freshman 
Lauren Stephenson in the third 
round, eventually winning the 
individual championship in a 
two-hole playoff. 

White attributes her success 

so far this season to vigorous 
training over the past year.

“I 
practiced 
a 
ton 
this 

summer,” White said. “I worked 
on 
my 
putting, 
because 
I 

struggled with (it) a lot before. 

That (practice) helped me a 
lot, especially on the last three 
holes.”

Just as White found success 

on The Course at Yale, her team 
rallied around her to shoot a 
combined score of 878, 10 strokes 
behind 
ultimate 
tournament 

champion Furman, but good 
enough for a third-place finish. 
Top 
Michigan 
performers 

included White (211, 2-under) 
and sophomores Megan Kim 
(220, 7-over) and Kathy Lim 
(222, 9-over). 

Dowling attributed her team’s 

strong finish to overall resiliency 
and trust in each other.

“It was a true team effort, 

that’s for sure,” Dowling said. 
“We made some bogies (in round 
two) … but we made a couple of 
minor adjustments (in round 
three), and we just dug deep.”

The Wolverines combined 

for a score of 286 in the third 
round, leading all teams in the 
tournament, an improvement 
from the East and West Match 
Play 
Challenge 
two 
weeks 

ago, when Michigan lost close 
contests to Oregon and Indiana, 
finishing fourth out of eight 
teams.

Another bright spot came in 

the form of freshman Elodie 
Van Dievoet, who recovered 
from a first-round score of 81 
to record a personal best 72 in 
the second round on her way 
to shooting an overall score of 
229. Van Dievoet, playing as an 
individual, finished tied for 31st 
after the final day.

“(Van Dievoet) gained some 

great 
experience,” 
Dowling 

said. “Her second round was 
impressive, particularly on the 
golf course we just played.”

With 
an 
excellent 
effort 

today, Dowling doesn’t feel any 
major changes need to be made 
in preparation for the coming 
weeks, including the Las Vegas 
Showdown on October 25.

“I think each player has some 

minor adjustments,” Dowling 
said. “(But) we know exactly 
what we need to do to win in Las 
Vegas.”

Nebraska controls 
Wolverines in win

By TYLER COADY

For the Daily

No. 4 Nebraska, with only 

two losses on the season, was 
always going to be a formidable 
opponent 
for 
the 

Michigan 
volleyball team. After Saturday 
night’s game in Lincoln, it was 
apparent that the Cornhuskers 
were 
a 
class 
above 
the 

Wolverines, as they dispatched 
the visitors, 3-1.

In the earlygoing of the first 

set, it was a back-and-forth tussle 
as Michigan (3-3 Big Ten, 13-4 
overall) and Nebraska traded 
points. 
The 

Wolverines’ 
junior middle 
blocker Abby 
Cole 
and 

sophomore 
outside 
hitter 
Adeja 

Lambert had 
nice 
starts 

to the game, 
recording two 
kills apiece in 
the first set.

Yet, with the score knotted 

at 
eight, 
the 
Cornhuskers 

(5-1, 14-2) began to pull away. 
Nebraska’s 
Mikaela 
Foecke, 

Amber 
Rolfzen 
and 
Kadie 

Rolfzen, who combined for 42 
kills in the match, began to give 
the Michigan defense trouble. 
The Cornhuskers raced out to 
a commanding lead and never 
looked back, taking the set by a 
score of 25-18.

“They run a simple offense, 

but they run it really well,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mark 

Rosen. 
“We 
couldn’t 
match 

their efficiency, and they were 
more consistent throughout the 
match.”

In 
the 
second 
set, 
the 

Wolverines came out with a 
renewed sense of confidence. Led 
by redshirt junior outside hitter 
Ally Davis, who had three kills in 
the set, Michigan took a 10-5 lead. 
Just as it looked like the tide was 

turning in the match, the fourth-
ranked Cornhuskers roared back 
into life, winning 15 of the next 
24 points en route to a 25-19 
set win. The Wolverines were 
forced into many mistakes as the 
Cornhuskers 
reasserted 
their 

dominance at the net, courtesy of 
the Rolfzens and Foecke.

In the third set, down two sets 

to zero, Michigan began to look 
like the team that had recently 
beaten Michigan State and Iowa. 
The Wolverines only trailed 
once in the entire set, and after 
breaking a 13-13 tie into a 16-13 
lead, they held on for a 25-20 set 
win.

“I loved that we fought back 

in the third 
set,” 
Rosen 

said. “Earlier 
in the season 
versus North 
Carolina and 
down 
2-0 

as 
well, 
we 

really 
didn’t 

muster much 
of a comeback. 
Tonight 
we 

kept battling, 

and I am happy with that.”

In the fourth set, Nebraska 

put 
any 
suggestions 
of 
a 

comeback to a quick rest as the 
Cornhuskers 
received 
adept 

attacking and strong defensive 
play from Amber Rolfzen, who 
stifled Michigan on defense and 
gave the Wolverines’ defenders 
problems on offense. Buoyed by 
a plethora of attacking options, 
Nebraska dominated Michigan 
in the game’s final set and eased 
to a 25-17 set win and a 3-1 match 
win.

With four games in Ann 

Arbor over the next two weeks, 
including an Oct. 24 matchup 
against Ohio State, Rosen knows 
where his team needs to improve 
and where it is excelling.

“I thought our blockers did 

a really nice job,” Rosen said, 
“but overall, we need to be more 
consistent, as we are going to be 
playing numerous teams at the 
same level as Nebraska.”

Sarkisian hat trick lifts 
‘M’ over Fighting Illini

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN

For the Daily

With the help of redshirt 

sophomore 
forward 
Ani 

Sarkisian’s 
first 
career 
hat 

trick, the Michigan women’s 
soccer team walked away with 
its second 
victory 
of 

the 
week. 

After 
beating No. 22 Northwestern 
on Thursday, the Wolverines 
came out Sunday afternoon 
with a valiant defensive effort 
once again, beating the Fighting 
Illini, 3-1. 

Michigan started off the 

game with high levels of energy 
and stout defense. From the 
start, the Wolverines (5-1-1 Big 
Ten, 10-4-1 overall) put pressure 
on Illinois and never let up. 
Within the first 17 minutes of the 
opening half, Michigan put up 
seven shots, while the Fighting 
Illini got off only one shot. 

“We put them under a lot of 

pressure and then they had a 
hard time getting in any kind 
of a rhythm,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Greg 

Ryan. 

Though the 

Wolverines 
were 
in 

control for the 
entire 
game, 

they suffered 
a 
setback 

in 
the 
17th 

minute when 
they gave up an own goal, 
putting Illinois up 1-0 early. 
The Fighting Illini (2-3-3, 8-3-
3) seemed to pick up some 
momentum. However, it was 
stopped in the 20th minute 
when 
Sarkisian 
maneuvered 

through the Illinois defense 

and kicked a hard line drive 
in the top right side of the net 
for Michigan’s first goal of the 
game, Sarkisian’s fourth of the 

season. 

“That first 

goal … she just 
kept 
going, 

kept pushing 
it 
by 
player 

after player,” 
Ryan 
said. 

“She was huge 
for us today.” 

The 

Wolverines 
continued 

their dominance for the rest of 
the match, holding the Fighting 
Illini’s offense to a minimum. In 
the final 10 minutes of the half, 
Michigan put up five shots and 
outshot Illinois, 9-2, in the first 
half. Though the Wolverines 
were 
in 
control, 
they 
still 

needed to find a way to put the 
ball in the net. 

After 
halftime, 
Michigan 

continued playing with the same 
energy and determination it 
showed consistently throughout 
the first half. At about the 51st 
minute, the Wolverines went on 
a full-out attack, with aggressive 
play from Sarkisian and junior 
forward 
Nicky 
Waldeck. 

However, they still were unable 
to get any results. 

The results started appearing 

in 
the 
65th 
minute, 
when 

Sarkisian scored her second goal 
of the day, knocking the ball 
off her chest and into the net 
with an assist from sophomore 
forward Taylor Timko. Sarkisian 
scored again three minutes later 
when she received a pass from 
freshman forward Reilly Martin 
and buried it, earning a hat trick.

“We were able to break 

apart their defense really well,” 
Sarkisian said. “They weren’t 
really sticking with our runs … 
and they weren’t able to stop us.”

Michigan 
remained 
in 

control of the game until the 
end, 
allowing 
the 
Fighting 

Illini just two shots in the final 
20 minutes of play. The only 
sign of a comeback came with a 
corner kick with eight minutes 
remaining, but the Wolverines’ 
defense proved too much for 
Illinois. 
Michigan 
held 
the 

Fighting Illini to five shots in 
the second half, maintaining the 
same dominance it showed in 
the first. 

“What (Ryan) has been telling 

us at halftime is, we can’t just sit 
back and hope that we’re gonna 
score,” said senior defender 
Christina Murillo. “We want to 
keep going at them for the full 
90 minutes.”

Home atmosphere 
boosts Wolverines

Michigan has won 
seven straight home 
games, outscoring 

opponents 15-3

By COLE ZINGAS

For the Daily

Drum-banging, soccer-crazed 

students decked out in maize 
and blue attire and chanting 
relentlessly is what Michigan 
soccer games have become known 
for.

The support of the Michigan 

Ultras in the student section, as 
well as fans, friends and family, 
has led senior defender Christina 
Murillo to fall in love with playing 
at “one of the best stadiums 
out there,” and apparently the 
rest of the Wolverines have as 
well. Michigan has outscored 
opponents a combined 24-6 at 
home this season, only losing a 
single game.

The Wolverines haven’t lost at 

U-M Soccer Stadium since Aug. 
23. They are now 4-0 in the Big 
Ten at home, and in these games 
they’ve combined to outshoot 
their opponents 91-25. 

When the Wolverines (5-1-1 

Big Ten, 10-4-1 overall) took on 
Illinois in Ann Arbor on Sunday, 
they showed once again the same 
energy and determination they’ve 
showed all year on home turf. 
With a 3-1 defeat of the Fighting 
Illini (2-3-3, 8-3-3), Michigan 
notched their eighth consecutive 
home win. 

Coming off a big home win 

against No. 22 Northwestern on 
Thursday, Michigan was looking 
to carry some momentum into 
the game against Illinois. But an 
unlucky bounce off of a defender 
into the net left the Wolverines 
trailing at home for the first time 
in Big Ten play. 

But that didn’t stop them. 

Michigan 
coach 
Greg 
Ryan 

pointed to the energy the players 
showed Sunday as the reason for 
the come-from-behind win, which 
has been consistent at every home 
game thus far. “The energy the 
team puts in here is really special,” 
Ryan said. “Today, Illinois just 
wasn’t able to cope with that 
amount of energy. I felt like that 
was the difference in the game.”

Not only does the crowd 

energize the players, but the 
players returned the favor with 
their determination. After the 
early Fighting Illini goal and 
many missed opportunities for 
the Wolverines, the crowd turned 
silent. But redshirt sophomore 
forward Ani Sarkisian got the 
home fans back into the game. 
Dribbling the ball past several 
defenders, Sarkisian moved the 
ball to the top of the box and 
ripped it home to tie the game at 1.

That 
extra 
determination 

Sarkisian showed on the first goal 
was what allowed her to capitalize 
on 
two 
more 
opportunities, 

scoring the first hat trick of her 
career. 

“We kept our possession up like 

usual today,” Sarkisian said. “We 
just finished more.”

Ryan was especially impressed 

with Sarkisian’s effort.

“Today, 
it 
was 
just 
that 

determination to go to goal,” he 
said. “She just kept going, pushing 
it by player after player.”

The defense, midfielders and 

forwards all worked together on 
Sunday, constantly putting shots 
on goal, playing physical defense 
and making few mental mistakes. 
Murillo would like this kind of 
home effort to continue, as only 
one more home game remains for 
her and other seniors who will be 
graduating after the season.

“Especially 
for 
us 
seniors, 

playing at home is always a great 
atmosphere,” Murillo said.

Wolverines suffer 
first Big Ten defeat

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

For the Daily

The game ended quickly. 

Despite 
so 
many 
perfectly 

placed shots, it just came down 
to one.

After a hard-fought, evenly-

matched game, the Michigan 
men’s soccer team couldn’t 
contain Rutgers forward Jason 
Wright, 
who 
shot 

the 
ball 

straight into the bottom left 
corner in the 93rd minute of 
Saturday’s game at U-M Soccer 
Stadium. With that first and 
only goal, the Wolverines (2-1-2, 
Big Ten, 5-3-3 overall) suffered 
their first conference loss of the 
season, 1-0.

“Overtime is a coin toss with 

any team,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “I think we just 
lost a coin toss today.”

Freshman forward Francis 

Atuahene and 
senior forward 
William 
Mellors-Blair 
continued 
to 
lead 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offensive 
attack. 
Atuahene 
led 

the team with four shots, with 
Mellors-Blair adding two. Both 
Atuahene 
and 
Mellors-Blair 

were tackled hard in the penalty 
box, at different points during 
the game, yet did not receive 
penalty kicks, much to the 
dismay of the fans at the game.

Junior 
defender 
Lars 

Eckenrode 
explained 
that 

despite the aggressiveness of the 
Rutgers (2-3-0, 6-4-1) defense, 
Michigan maintained its typical 
approach.

“East Coast teams are tougher 

on the tackle,” Eckenrode said. 
“I know that, just being from 
the East Coast. It (gave) us a 
little more energy to come even 
harder on the tackle.”

The Wolverines and Scarlet 

Knights fought neck and neck 

throughout the game. The two 
teams attempted 14 and 13 shots, 
including three and four on goal, 
respectively. The teams also had 
similar foul counts, and each 
goalkeeper saved three shots.

Many of Michigan’s chances 

were created by junior midfielder 
Rylee Woods. Woods took many 
of the set pieces, including the 
Wolverines’ 11 corners. In the 
63rd minute, the junior crossed 
a ball into the box to senior 
midfielder Colin McAtee, but 
the ensuing header was blocked 
by the Rutgers goalkeeper.

Sunday marked Michigan’s 

third 
consecutive 
overtime 

match. The team continued 
into extra time with the same 
strategy and mindset it held 
throughout the previous 90 
minutes. Daley emphasized how 
quick and aggressive overtime 
matches can seem.

“When you’re at home, you 

don’t sit and defend for 20 

minutes,” 
Daley 
said. 

“Obviously 
we want to 
go for it and 
play it on the 
offensive.”

Despite the 

team’s failure 
to convert its 

chances, Daley shied away from 
criticizing the team’s offensive 
attacking skills.

“It was a rough day at the 

office,” he said.

Daley praised the Scarlet 

Knights for their performance. 
He also spoke of the strength 
of the Big Ten conference as a 
whole, noting the difficulty of 
playing each team.

Daley stressed that Michigan 

will look to move forward from 
this loss and focus on preparing 
for its upcoming games.

“We gotta put this behind us, 

(not) dwell on it,” he said. “We 
have to move on, get our minds 
right for Tuesday.”

In a heads-or-tails match, the 

coin came up on the wrong side 
for the Wolverines.

Senior back Lauren Thomas led a stifling Michigan defense that shut out No. 20 Iowa and No. 9 Stanford over the weekend.
Michigan defeats two ranked teams

By MIKE PERSAK

For the Daily

With two wins over ranked 

opponents this weekend, the No. 
16 Michigan field hockey team is 
becoming 
a 
national 

force. 
The 

Wolverines’ 
wins 
over 

Iowa 
and 

Stanford 
came in different fashions, but 
both were extremely important 
for 
Michigan 
coach 
Marcia 

Pankratz and her team.

Friday’s game against No. 20 

Iowa was a dominant display from 
the Wolverines on both offense 
and defense, as they came away 
with a 4-0 victory.

“It was a huge game,” Pankratz 

said. “We rose to the occasion and 
played well. I was really proud of 
the team.”

Senior back Lauren Thomas 

came up with two goals in the 
win, her fourth and fifth of the 
season, while senior forward 

Shannon Scavelli and sophomore 
back Katie Trombetta also netted 
a goal each.

“We can’t win if our team is not 

performing and scoring goals,” 
Thomas said. “So that’s really nice 
to be able to say that I can help 
with that.”

Sophomore goalkeeper Sam 

Swenson 
complemented 
the 

offensive outpouring by holding 
the 
Hawkeyes 

scoreless. 
The 

performance 
marked 
the 

team’s 
fifth 

shutout of the 
year. However, 
Swenson, who 
played most of 
the game before 
being 
relieved 

by 
redshirt 

junior Chris Lueb with 11 minutes 
remaining, was quick to give 
praise to her teammates for their 
contributions to the shutout.

“It comes from the defense, and 

the midfield, and the offense first,” 
Swenson said. “Then it comes to 

us. But our defense does all of the 
hard work, and then (Lueb) really 
got the shutout in the end.”

Following Friday’s win, the 

Wolverines traveled to Evanston 
to take on No. 9 Stanford at a 
neutral site.

Michigan drew first blood 

when Scavelli scored her second 
goal of the weekend 15 minutes 
into the game.

One 
goal 

was 
all 
the 

Wolverines 
would need, as 
the 
Cardinal 

had no answer 
for Michigan’s 
stout defense. 
Stanford 
fell 

victim to the 
Wolverines’ 
second 

straight shutout, 1-0.

The 
two 
wins 
from 
the 

weekend 
could 
have 
larger 

implications for Michigan, not 
only in terms of momentum, but 
also in terms of NCAA ranking as 
the postseason approaches.

Because 
of 
their 
current 

ranking, the Wolverines aren’t yet 
shoe-ins for the 16-team NCAA 
Tournament. Defeating top teams 
will help Michigan’s case.

While 
the 
weekend 
wins 

marked the Wolverines’ fifth and 
sixth shutouts of the year and 
improved the team’s record against 
ranked opponents to 3-3, Michigan 
remains focused simply on being at 
its best by the end of the season.

“We have a debriefing after 

every game,” Pankratz said. “Win 
or lose, we’re trying to learn, 
trying to grow.”

Even with the big weekend, the 

Wolverines still have room for 
improvement. They will travel on 
the road for their next three games 
before returning to Ann Arbor for 
their regular season finale against 
Ohio State on October 31.

But if Michigan continues 

to play as it has over its five-
game 
winnng 
streak, 
with 

timely offense and lockdown 
defense, it will be hard to keep 
the Wolverines out of the NCAA 
Tournament.

Nearly flawless

I

n a span of one minute 
Saturday afternoon, the 
Michigan football team 

was both 
relentless and 
merciful.

Nearly 

three hours 
after Jehu 
Chesson 
returned 
the game’s 
opening 
kickoff for 
a 96-yard 
touchdown, 
the Wildcats still hadn’t scored, 
and the Wolverines appeared to 
have little intention of easing off 
the gas.

With 47 seconds left, 

Northwestern had the ball 
trailing 38-0 and facing an 
almost meaningless 3rd-and-17. 
But the Michigan starters were 
still in, and the student section 
was still making noise.

If the Michigan defense 

wasn’t calling it a day, neither 
were the fans. They screamed 
through an incompletion on 
3rd-and-long, then kept it up 
when Northwestern went for it 
on fourth down. The Wildcats 
turned it over, and only then did 
the Wolverines show mercy.

After leaving most of the 

defensive starters in for the 
game’s final series, fifth-
year senior quarterback Jake 
Rudock kneeled down, ending 
a resounding 38-0 win over No. 
13 Northwestern. The sequence 
was emblematic of the entire 
game, with Michigan letting up 
only when it decided it was done. 
Everything happened on the 
Wolverines’ terms Saturday.

They bludgeoned one of the 

nation’s top defenses for 201 
rushing yards and 380 total, and 
they held their third straight 
opponent scoreless. For the 
second time, they did so against 
a ranked opponent.

It was, as Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh said after the game, 
“near flawless.”

The game had been billed 

as a clash of the Big Ten’s top 
two defenses, one that might 
be decided by the first team to 
score. That was half-right.

The 18th-ranked Wolverines 

were the first — and also the 
only — team to score. They lived 
up to their end of the billing, 
holding the Wildcats to just 168 
yards and only once allowing 
even a chance for Northwestern 
to score — a 42-yard field goal 
attempt in the first quarter, 
which the Wildcats missed. 
But they also scored 38 points 
on the vaunted Northwestern 
defense. There was almost 
nothing they could have done 
better.

Well, there was one thing. 

Senior linebacker James Ross III 
was ejected for targeting in the 
third quarter, meaning he will 
miss the first half of next week’s 
game against Michigan State 
— a game that just became one 
of national importance. And if 
you want to get picky, fifth-year 
senior punter Blake O’Neill had 
his first touchback of the season 
— his first two, actually.

But other than that, it was 

a businesslike, merciless 
trouncing.

Michigan posted eight more 

tackles for loss, exactly on 
par with its average through 
six games. The Wolverines 
won the turnover battle 
with an interception which 
junior cornerback Jourdan 
Lewis ripped from a receiver 
and returned 37 yards for a 
touchdown. And they still 
weren’t entirely satisfied.

“When we’re out there, 

we don’t want to give them 
anything,” said redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers. 
“If a shutout is the byproduct 
of that, then so be it. But when 
we’re out there, we’re just 
concentrating on three-and-

outs. Constant three-and-outs.”

It was close to constant 

three-and-outs on Saturday. 
Northwestern had 13 first 
downs, six more than Maryland 
had a week earlier. But it says 
something that first downs are 
the way to compare Michigan’s 
recent opponents. Since no one 
can score on them, there just 
isn’t much else to go by.

Six weeks into the season, 

only one team has scored 
more than a touchdown on the 
Wolverines, and that team is No. 
5 Utah.

On Saturday, Michigan added 

to its defensive prowess and 
turned in stellar performances 
in all three phases of the game. 
The Wolverines got three 
rushing touchdowns: one from 
Rudock, one from redshirt junior 
running back Drake Johnson 
and another from junior running 
back Derrick Green. Chesson 
scored Michigan’s first kick-
return touchdown since 2009 
and Kenny Allen hit a career-
long, 47-yard field goal.

It was fitting that all of this 

happened on afternoon with 
clear skies, warm weather and 
a general feeling of delight 
around campus. Fans did the 
wave halfway through the 
third quarter, and as the clock 
ticked down its final seconds, 
the students remained engaged, 
chanting, “We want State.”

When time expired, the 

Wolverines sprinted to the 
student section, led by redshirt 
freshman receiver Maurice 
Ways, senior cornerback Jeremy 
Clark and senior linebacker 
Royce Jenkins-Stone. They 
jumped into the stands as the 
Michigan Marching Band blared 
“The Victors.”

It was a genuinely euphoric 

moment. It was nearly flawless.

Five Things We Learned

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Another tough team that was 

having unexpected success this 
fall came into the Big House on 
Saturday. For the third time in 
three weeks, Michigan’s opponent 
left with its tail between its legs.

This time, the victim was No. 13 

Northwestern, and the Wildcats 
fell even harder than then-No. 
22 Brigham Young did two 
weeks ago. The Wolverinees beat 
Northwestern, 38-0, and the score 
was closer than the game.

Outscoring 
opponents 
160-

14 in their last five games, the 
Wolverines have made a routine 
out of blowouts. Still, here are five 
things we learned from Saturday’s 
win.

1. Jourdan Lewis is the best 
cornerback in the country.

Peppers was confident in his 

claim that junior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis was the best at his 
craft in all of college football, and 
he very well could be right. Lewis 
took his second interception of 
the season 37 yards to the end 
zone on Saturday and could 
be seen wreaking havoc on 
Northwestern’s offense behind 
the line of scrimmage and 40 
yards downfield.

Through six games, Lewis has 

allowed just four completions and 
has broken up or intercepted 10 
passes. The numbers aren’t just 
good — they’re emblematic of the 
fact that quarterbacks no longer 
throw in his direction. Some say 
they make him the best in the 
nation.

“He’s the best corner in the 

country,” Peppers said. “That 
makes everybody’s job a lot easier 
when you’ve got a guy out there 
that shuts down half the field. It’s 
expected from him. It’s not like, 
‘Oh, good job, Jourdan.’ No, we 
expect that from him. Jourdan 
inspires me to play better.”

2. Give Jehu Chesson the ball.

Even though fifth-year senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock has 
struggled to find redshirt-junior 

wide 
receiver 
Jehu 
Chesson 

downfield, every time the receiver 
touches the ball, he has the 
opportunity to score. Chesson, 
whom Harbaugh says is the fastest 
player on the team, flashed that 
ability from the opening whistle 
with a 96-yard touchdown return 
that was the Wolverines’ first 
opening kickoff touchdown since 
1992.

On 
offense, 
Chesson 
is 

averaging 22.4 yards per carry 
for two scores, has emerged as 
one of Rudock’s primary targets 
in the passing game and moved 
Michigan into the red zone on 
both of its first two possessions. 
Chesson has seen plenty of action 
on offense, but based on his 
performance as of late, you can 
never have too much Chesson.

3. A.J. Williams can bridge the 
gap at tight end.

All season, much of the offense 

has gone through the tight 
ends. That will continue for the 
foreseeable future, as tight ends 
have been a critical part of every 
offense Harbaugh and offensive 
coordinator Tim Drevno have 
been a part of.

That commitment to tight ends, 

though improving, has slowed 
down Michigan’s offense. Aside 
from Butt, who has showcased 
NFL potential in many of the 
Wolverines’ first five games, tight 
ends have often stalled drives 
with missed targets and dropped 
passes. Williams was among the 
culprits, as the senior showed a 
lack of catching ability that led 
many to write him off as another 
offensive lineman.

But 
against 
Northwestern, 

Williams was the star of the 
show, hauling in a team-high 
four catches for 49 yards. On a 
day when junior Jake Butt and 
top receiving targets were well-
covered, Williams turned all four 
of his targets into first downs, 
indicating that a tight end-heavy 
offense can still carry the load.

4. The defensive line runs deep.

Okay, we didn’t really learn 

this Saturday, but it was once 

again proven that this unit is not 
only arguably the top-performing 
defensive front in the country, but 
the deepest. The unit has already 
lost two players expected to be 
key contributors — sophomore 
defensive tackle Bryan Mone and, 
just last week, senior defensive 
end Mario Ojemudia — but seem 
to improve the more they utilize 
the depth chart.

Each week, new players come 

in and take the lion’s share of 
time in the backfield. Ojemudia 
had been that player earlier 
this season, but on Saturday, 
it was senior defensive tackle 
Willie Henry, whose 2.5 tackles 
for loss paced another solid 
day for the defensive front. 
Though saddened by the end 
of their teammate’s career, the 
defense was as dominant as ever, 
becoming the first FBS team 
in 20 years to shut out three 
consecutive opponents.

And 
as 
for 
Ojemudia’s 

replacement? 
Senior 
Royce 

Jenkins-Stone was fifth on the 
team with four tackles and even 
drew a couple double teams.

5. BOLD PREDICTION: The 
hype is real. See you in Pasadena.

Emphasis on the bold here, 

but Michigan fans are smelling 
roses, and deservedly so. The 
Wolverines have outscored two 
ranked opponents, 69-0, and their 
only blemish is a seven-point road 
loss to serious playoff contender 
No. 5 Utah.

More importantly, Michigan 

continues to get better on offense, 
and is suddenly a team with few 
holes that looks like the legitimate 
front-runner of the Big Ten. 
That will continue when the 
Wolverines host No. 7 Michigan 
State next week, and though both 
teams should lose to top-ranked 
Ohio State, Michigan should win 
all the games in between, earning 
its first trip to the Rose Bowl since 
2007.

THE MICHIGAN 

DAILY TOP-10 POLL 

2. BAYLOR: The state of Kansas 
was shaken — literally — after 
410-pound tight end LaQuan 
McGowan’s touchdown.

1. OHIO STATE: The Buckeyes 
allowed 28 points to Maryland, 
which is kind of like eating just 
ketchup on a hot dog. It works 
fine, but why?

9. FLORIDA: The Gators 
avoided a trap game at 
Missouri and now face LSU. A 
word of advice: 11 men in the 
box. At all times.

3. TCU: Trevone Boykin 
accounted for 425 total yards 
against Kansas State, which 
is almost as many years as Bill 
Snyder has been coaching.

6. CLEMSON: As long as Dabo 
keeps dancing, we don’t really 
care if the Tigers have a weak 
strength of schedule.

5. LSU: The NCAA allowed 
Leonard Fournette to auction 
his jersey to benefit flood 
victims. The NCAA allowed 
something. There is nothing 
Fournette can’t do.

7. MICHIGAN STATE: The 
Spartans play Michigan this 
week, which is important for 
one reason: It means it’s time 
for us to beat The State News 
for the 11th straight year.

4. UTAH: The Utes beat Cal 
on a late defensive stand, but 
the state of California banned 
the nickname “Redskins” 
from being used a mascot in its 
schools. Who’s the real winner?

8. ALABAMA: With a gritty 
comeback win over Arkansas, 
the Tide proved they’re at 
least as talented as the mighty 
Toledo Rockets.

10. TEXAS A&M: DID YOU 
KNOW: Texas A&M has a 
satellite campus in Qatar?

The good, bad and ugly

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

It was supposed to be a 

defensive 
struggle, 
a 
close 

contest between the two top 
scoring defenses in the country. 
But just a few minutes in, it 
was clear that all preconceived 
notions of Saturday’s matchup 
between the No. 18 Michigan 
football 
team 
and 
No. 
13 

Northwestern were irrelevant.

The Wolverines returned the 

opening kickoff for a touchdown 
and did not look back. Michigan 
led 21-0 at the end of the first 
quarter, eliminating even the 
thought of a Wildcat victory. 
The Wolverines dominated all 
three phases of the game.

Here’s the good, the bad and 

the ugly from Saturday’s 38-0 
rout.

The good

Good 
might 
not 
be 
a 

strong enough superlative to 
describe Michigan’s defensive 
performance 
Saturday. 
The 

Wolverines recorded their third 
straight shutout in dominating 
fashion, allowing just 168 total 
yards. Northwestern did not 
reach the red zone during the 
game.

Michigan had not recorded 

three 
consecutive 
shutouts 

since 1980. No Football Bowl 
Subdivision team had done so 
since 1995.

Junior cornerback Jourdan 

Lewis scored Michigan’s first 
defensive touchdown of the 
season, 
snatching 
the 
ball 

away from Northwestern wide 
receiver Mike McHugh in the 
second quarter and returning it 
37 yards.

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake Rudock played what might 
have been his best game in a 
Michigan uniform, completing 
17 of his 23 pass attempts for 179 
yards. More importantly, he did 
not turn the ball over.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith did not appear to be 
hindered by the ankle injury that 
kept him out against Maryland. 
He scampered for 59 yards on 
eight carries. He ran ruggedly, 
breaking tackles on numerous 
occasions, just like he did during 
his early-season standout games.

The Wolverines’ special teams 

unit made sure it was not left 
out of the fun, either. Michigan 
redshirt junior wide receiver 
Jehu 
Chesson 
returned 
the 

game’s opening kickoff 96 yards 
for a touchdown, starting an 
onslaught that did not subside.

The bad

The 
Wolverines 
allowed 

Northwestern to almost score. 
The Wildcats attempted a field 
goal in the first quarter, but 
they missed. Northwestern also 
finished two drives in Michigan 
territory, a telltale sign of 
what was clearly a disgraceful 
defensive performance.

In another cause for absolute 

panic, fifth-year senior punter 
Blake 
O’Neill 
booted 
two 

touchbacks.

This is a comprehensive list. It 

is in no way sarcastic.

The ugly

Two controversial targeting 

calls 
provided 
some 
drama 

in Saturday’s game. The first 
occurred in the second quarter, 
when Northwestern defensive 
back 
Matthew 
Harris 
hit 

Rudock’s upper body during a 
slide. The call was overturned, 
much to Michigan’s chagrin.

The confusion escalated in 

the third quarter. Michigan 
senior linebacker James Ross 
III was ejected for targeting 
when he crushed a defenseless 
Wildcat wide receiver. The call, 
unlike the previous one, was 
not overturned. Ross will be 
suspended for the first half of 
the Wolverines’ game against 
No. 7 Michigan State as a result.

Northwestern’s 
offensive 

performance would also qualify 
as ugly. Three different Wildcat 
quarterbacks took snaps under 
center, but none of the three 
enjoyed success. Backups Zack 
Oliver and Matt Alviti each 
attempted three passes. Both 
quarterbacks were sacked (once) 
as frequently as they completed 
passes (also once). 

Starter 
Clayton 
Thorson 

did not fare much better. He 
completed 13 of his 27 pass 
attempts for 106 yards. Lewis’ 
interception was the low point.

Michigan awaits the Spartans 

next week. A fourth straight 
shutout is unlikely. But then 
again, the Wolverines have defied 
preconceived notions before.
