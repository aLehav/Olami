CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Sen. Rick Jones 
seeks to increase 
regulations on 

ridesharing services

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Controversy in Michigan over 

ride services such as Uber and 
Lyft continued Wednesday after-
noon as the Michigan Senate’s 
Regulatory Reform Committee 
discussed two bills proposing to 
regulate similar companies in the 
state.

The two proposed bills seek to 

regulate the companies by requir-
ing them to follow taxicab regula-
tions. One bill would require the 
companies to complete the same 
safety inspections and carry 
the same insurance as taxicab 
companies. The second would 
mandate background tracks and 
require drivers to hold chauffer 
licenses.

Ten MIPs were 

issued over weekend 

in the downtown 

area

The weekend that follows St. 

Patrick’s Day, frequently dubbed 
“St. Fratty’s Day,” is widely cel-
ebrated at the University.

In recent years, University offi-

cials, student organizations and 
law enforcement agencies have 
aimed to increase student safety on 
St. Fratty’s Day.

According to Diane Brown, the 

spokesperson for the Division of 
Safety and Security, the University 
of Michigan Police Department 
made just four alcohol-related 
arrests this past weekend. Three 
of the arrests, of which one was a 
University student, were for minor 
in possession of alcohol, and one 
was for operating while intoxicat-

ed, issued to a visitor.

The Ann Arbor Police Depart-

ment issued six minor in posses-
sion of alcohol tickets, two open 
container tickets, four disturbing 
the peace notices and made one 
drunk driving arrest.

The Ann Arbor crime map con-

firmed that between 11:36 a.m. and 
4:32 p.m. on Saturday, March 21, 
the AAPD issued three citations for 
disturbing the peace — one on the 
1000 block of Hill Street, another 
on the 800 block of East Univer-
sity Avenue and another on the 800 

block of South Forest Avenue.

“From a law enforcement per-

spective, activities this weekend 
went well,” University Police Chief 
Robert Neumann said. “We believe 
the strong planning efforts in 
advance of St. Patrick’s Day and the 
activities to educate our communi-
ty and provide resources were very 
helpful.”

president of the University’s chap-

Data analysis shows 
representation not 

consistent with

This year’s Central Student 

Government election will set a 
record — though perhaps not the 
most progressive sort. For the first 
time in recent decades, regardless 
of Thursday’s results, seven men 
in a row will serve as president of 
Central Student Government.

That’s one of the findings of a 

Michigan Daily analysis, which 
detailed the racial and gender 
identities of each CSG president 
and vice president since 1993. 
Each incumbent disclosed his 
or her racial and gender iden-
tity to the Daily. In limited cases, 
where the executive could not be 
reached, their gender and racial 
identity was considered based on 
membership in cultural organiza-
tions or other information listed 

on the individual’s social media 
profile, or through colleagues 
who said they were comfortable 
confirming how the individual 
identified.

Highlights

Students from a range of back-

grounds have represented their 
classmates as CSG president and 
vice president. In 2000, a 26-year-
old Japanese international student 
was elected president after holding 
signs on the Diag reading, “Tell me 
your concerns.” Other highlights 
from the last few decades, which 
have witnessed the end of affir-
mative action, include the first gay 
president in 2011 and first Black 
female president in 1993.

Former CSG leaders inter-

viewed by the Daily, however, 
agreed on the need for increased 
diversity.

“The purpose of CSG is to 

represent all 42,000 students 
on campus,” Business graduate 
student Omar Hashwi, CSG vice 
president during the 2012-2013 
academic year, said. “By not hav-
ing an adequate amount of repre-
sentatives or leadership on CSG,

Home to some of the University’s 

most recognizable buildings and an 
array of popular student hangouts, 
the South University and Tappan 
neighborhoods illustrates much of 
the influence of students on Ann 
Arbor’s landscape.

South University

Adjacent 
to 
Central 
Cam-

pus, the South University area 
includes University Towers, and 
several other high rise apartment 
buildings. Bisected by Washtenaw 
Avenue, the neighborhood’s bor-
ders are typically considered Ged-
des Avenue, Church Street and 
South University Avenue.

The neighborhood is also near 

the C.C. Little bus stop, the Cen-
tral Campus Recreation Building 
and the Hill area. These attributes 
make the neighborhood a frequent 
choice for students who wish to 
live close to Central Campus.

The core street of this neigh-

borhood is South University Ave-
nue. On any given day, students

CSG absolutely cannot fill its pur-
pose. It is not possible for CSG to fill 
its purpose if it can’t represent its 
students. There are certain needs 
that the different communities 
require and if those people are not 
on student government, it’s really 
hard to identify those needs and 
execute on the appropriate strate-
gies to fulfill those needs.”

Comparing CSG presidential and 

vice presidential representation to 
the student demographic break-
down reveals disparities in almost 
all categories but white students.

“The environment is not always 

created on CSG to be welcoming 
of very different perspectives,” 
said LSA junior Meagan Shokar. 
Shokar served as secretary dur-
ing her freshman and sophomore 
years and as vice president earlier 
this year before stepping down due 
medical purposes.

The student demographic break-

down was obtained through aver-
aging racial identities of the student 
population from 1993 to 2015, using 
the years 1995, 2000, 2005, 2014. 
Data was obtained from the Office 
of the Registrar.

Numbers prior to 1993 were not 

available in accessible formats, 
constricting the comparison years 
to after 1993. The comparison was 
also limited because the University 
does not recognize certain nuances 
in ethnicity and gender. It does not 
report how many students do not 
conform to the gender binary, nor 
the ethnicity of international stu-
dents (called “non-resident aliens” 
in the Registrar’s data), nor how 
many Arab students attend the 
University — who are classified as 
white. Asian students are grouped 
into one category despite the dif-
ferences among, say, Pakistani, 
Malaysian or Korean communities 
on campus.

Also complicating the conclud-

ing analysis is an “unknown” cate-
gory, totaling 7 percent of the scope 
between the four years averaged 
between 1993 and 2014 .

The Daily’s analysis found that 

Asian American and Black students 
on campus are well represented 
compared to their respective popu-
lations on campus. Black presidents 
and vice presidents have accounted 
for 10.7 percent of presidents and 

7.1 percent of vice presidents in the 
last two decades, 66 percent higher 
than the Black population.

As international students are not 

ultimately sorted into racial catego-
ries, it may be that Asian students in 
general are actually under-repre-
sented as CSG executives due to the 
large proportion of international 
students from Asia.

LSA senior Alex Abdun-Nabi, 

CSG treasurer, attributed these 
groups’ proportionally large repre-
sentation on CSG to their legacy as 
activists campus wide, particularly 
the Black Student Union’s activity 
in the past year.

“It doesn’t surprise me that 

they’re involved in CSG because 
it’s a prime way to make change on 
campus,” Abdun-Nabi said.

Other groups have less vigorous 

representation. No CSG president 
or vice president for the last 20 
years have identified as Hispanic 
or Native American. These groups 
have comprised, respectively, 4.18 
percent and 0.53 percent of the stu-
dent body on average.

Three Latina students noted the 

general lack of Hispanic students as a 
barrier for greater CSG representation.

“I don’t think it’s lack of interest in 

CSG, it’s the lack of support,” Nurs-
ing junior Anna Pokriefka said as to 
why more Latinos were not leaders 
of CSG. “They don’t feel a sense of 
community or feel discriminated by 
the majority population.”

LSA senior Sarah Ballew, co-

chair of the Native American 
Student Association, wrote in an 
e-mail interview that she does not 
think CSG is representative of her 
and others.

“I don’t think it is representa-

tive, exactly, because it doesn’t have 
an adequate number of members 
that are WOC/Native American,” 
Ballew wrote. “This would inhibit 
representation because that view-
point is missing.”

Abdun-Nabi noted that, of the 

hundreds involved in CSG, there is 
representation at levels other than 
president and vice president.

“President and vice president 

are not the only people,” he said. 
“Sometimes they’re not the people 
doing the most work.”

One-fourth of presidents and 

less than one-third of vice presi-
dents have been females, who com-
prise 52 percent of the student body.

“I would argue very strongly 

that we have amazing female lead-
ers on this campus with all sorts of 

racial identities and sexual orienta-
tions, so why are none of them run-
ning for president or vice president 
seat this year?” Public Policy senior 
Carly Manes said. She was a repre-
sentative in the 2013-2014 academic 
year and ran for CSG president.

Students of similar identities 

tended to succeed each other as 
CSG leaders. For instance, from 
2002-2006, every vice president 
was female. In 2009, 2010 and 2013, 
every president identified as Asian. 
Similar trends applied for other 
identities, indicating that students 
could set trends for representation 
on campus or bring their own social 
networks into CSG.

Many former or current CSG 

members who were interviewed 
pointed to that trend in particular, 
framing it positively or negatively.

Party politics

The process for earning the CSG 

presidency or vice presidency often 
starts with being identified by exist-
ing CSG members as a candidate. 
Often, that’s done with a political 
party, not unlike national politics.

Business 
graduate 
student 

Michael Proppe, who was CSG 
president during the 2013-2014 aca-
demic year, said CSG parties gener-
ally last about two years in name 
and are grouped by two ideologies. 
According to Proppe, one is typical-
ly based on tangibility, accomplish-
ing goals that are feasible during 
the candidate’s one-year term. The 
other, he said, is typically more 
idealistic. Members of this party 
may, for instance, focus on making 
campus climate more comfortable 
rather than things more easily mea-
sured when reviewing the year.

Abdun-Nabi, who is not affili-

ated with a party, described these 
parties as a good way to enter and 
lead CSG.

“A lot of the gatekeepers in CSG 

are not exercised by CSG,” Abdun-
Nabi said. “They’re exercised by the 
party.”

Proppe, who ran with Make 

Michigan, a party that has won 
the presidency two years in a row, 
said the groups are generally posi-
tive. He said they promote diversity, 
and to win the election, candidates 
must have a diverse slate of repre-
sentatives.

“The parties are actively recruit-

ing people and talking them into 
running, either because they think 
they’re very intelligent and hard 
workers or they think they have

Committee discusses police 
oversight recommendations

Members agree to 
ask city for funding 
in upcoming budget

By ANDREW ALMANI 

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor Human Rights 

Commission’s Subcommittee on 
Civilian Police Oversight con-
tinued deliberations Wednesday 
evening about the proposed cre-
ation of an oversight board for 
the city’s police force.

Subcommittee Chair Dwight 

Wilson, a HRC member, led the 
meeting, focusing on questions 
about the Ann Arbor commu-
nity at large, the operations of 
the police department and how a 
civilian police oversight commit-
tee would function if established.

Over the past few months, 

the 
subcommittee 
conducted 

research on police oversight 
organizations across the nation 

to better understand their logis-
tical difficulties and effective-
ness.

The committee was started 

in response to broad community 
concerns about the role of police 
in the Ann Arbor community.

One of the experts who has 

provided advice to the com-
mittee is Barbara Attard, an 
oversight and police practices 
consultant recommended to the 
board by the ACLU.

In a written statement from 

Attard shared with the subcom-
mittee Wednesday, she high-
lighted the dynamic nature of 
police oversight committees.

“Oversight is not a static pro-

cess and should evolve over time 
to incorporate effective practices 
learned from others, and to be 
continually responsive to chang-
ing community needs,” Attard 
wrote. “In order to succeed, the 
oversight body must be inde-
pendent from special interest 
groups, police … and government 

officials. The community, as well 
as the police officers under over-
sight scrutiny, must trust that the 
oversight agency and its leader-
ship are fair and unbiased.”

The subcommittee has also 

spoken with Richard Jerome, 
the deputy police monitor of the 
NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program. 
Wilson said Jerome indicated 
that all police oversight com-
mittees prompt opposition from 
police unions until the commit-
tee proves to be fair and compe-
tent.

Jerome also said that on 

the other end of the spectrum, 
oversight committees are often 
criticized by police activists 
who doubt the effectiveness 
and impact of the committee’s 
efforts. The best way to counter 
this is via community outreach, 
and 
surveys 
or 
publications 

assessing the committee’s work, 
he said.

The fatal shooting of Ann 

Arbor resident Aura Rosser by 
police last November sparked 
discourse in the community 
about the use of force by law 
enforcement. In relation spe-
cifically to that incident, the 
subcommittee 
also 
discussed 

suggestions of embedding men-
tal health workers within the 
police department.

In the agenda presented to the 

subcommittee, Wilson highlight-
ed Washtenaw County’s Project 
Outreach Team, a program that 
aids police in dealing with men-
tally ill residents, as an already 
existing resource.

“PORT has a 24-hour crisis 

intervention line, which comes in 
handy because the chief of police 
says the majority of people with 
whom they come in contact have 
mental challenges,” he wrote.

Subcommittee members who 

were present included fourth-
year Medical student Mohamad 
Issa, Law student Nick Kabat and 
Human Rights Commissioner 
Pamela Dent.

Neither bill was brought to a 

vote Wednesday, meaning both 
remain in committee and will not 
be voted on by the full Senate at 
this time.

In an interview Tuesday, State 

Sen. Rick Jones (R–Grand Ledge), 
one of the sponsors for the bills, 
said the delay is not uncommon. 
He added that he expected a vote 
at a future committee meeting.

When Uber came to the Detroit 

area in December 2013, the Michi-
gan Department of Transporta-
tion notified the companies of 
transportation laws in the state. 
However, Uber has stated that it 
doesn’t think their model is bound 
by those laws, causing complaints 
from both lawmakers and tradi-
tional taxi services.

Jones said his bill was designed 

to correct several discrepancies 
between taxicab services and ride-
sharing companies, namely those 
concerning insurance. According 
to Uber, drivers are currently cov-
ered by a commercial insurance 
policy capped at $1 million per 
accident. A minimum $1 million 
insurance policy is also required 
for traditional taxicabs, but under 
state licensing rules, cabs have to 
provide documentation of that to 
the state. Ridesharing companies 
currently do not.

Jones said it’s problematic that 

Uber is not mandated to provide 
proof of appropriate insurance 
coverage.

“What I’m looking for is a 

solution to a problem,” Jones 
said. “Also, what I’m seeking to 
do is to get Uber to carry proper 
insurance.”

Taxicabs are also required to 

have their vehicle inspected, to 
register vehicles for $50 and to pay 
a one-time fee of $300, along with 

a renewal fee of $50, to receive a 
Certificate of Authority.

Uber has not supported passage 

of these bills, but in an interview 
Wednesday, Uber Michigan Man-
ager Michael White said Uber is 
open to having a regulatory struc-
ture that more closely follows their 
business model, citing commercial 
insurance policies in particular.

“We want to make sure every 

trip is covered by commercial level 
insurance by order of regulation 
that codifies that at the city or state 
level,” he said.

Jones said he wants to ensure 

that passengers are legally insured 
by Michigan auto insurance policy. 
He noted that he does not want 
Uber to stop business, just to fol-
low the laws that will allow for fair 
competition.

“We’re not trying to put Uber 

out of business,” he said. “We want 
them to prosper, but they just need 
to play by the rules and be respon-
sible corporate citizens.”

A previous bill was introduced 

during last year’s lame duck ses-
sion that was supported by Uber, 
but failed to reach a vote in the State 
House.

John Etter, president of Blue Cab 

Company, expressed similar views. 
He said these bills would foster pub-
lic safety and bring order to Uber’s 
“chaotic” business model.

“I think it’s a good develop-

ment and I hope it passes and then 
Uber can continue competing, but 
without the massive, pretty unfair 
advantages they currently enjoy, 
such as not paying insurance, 
which, of course, is one of my big-
gest expenses,” he said.

Merlyn Wade, owner of Ann 

Arbor Cab, said the taxicab com-
panies are not concerned with the 
competition presented, but rather 
believe Uber should be subject to 
the same laws.

“It’s not about the competition,” 

he said. “They need to follow the 

same rules everyone else is follow-
ing. What makes Uber better than 
you? Why should you have to follow 
the rules and Uber doesn’t?”

Wade cited incidents in San 

Francisco and Boston in which 
Uber drivers harmed their passen-
gers. He said the incidents demon-
strated that increased regulation 
would improve the safety of pas-
sengers and hold Uber to the same 
standards as other transportation 
companies.

Another common issue taxicab 

drivers highlighted in regards to 
ridesharing companies is surge 
pricing, a pricing model Uber uses 
to increase fares when there is high 
demand. State law doesn’t allow 
taxicab drivers to do this.

Jones said the bills don’t spe-

cifically address surge pricing, but 
added that surge pricing does need 
to be addressed eventually.

Uber’s website says surge pric-

ing “encourages drivers to become 
available,” and notifies the customer 
of the price.

Overall, White said, Uber feels it 

is primarily a technology company 
because the app connects part-time 
drivers with passengers, instead of 
arranging rides directly, meaning 
it should not be subject to the same 
regulations as traditional taxicabs.

“The 
drivers 
are 
not 
our 

employees,” White said. “We’re 
partnering with them and they’re 
using our platform to connect 
with their passengers, who are the 
people who have signed up to use 
our platform to connect with these 
drivers.”

Jones disagreed. He said the 

services provided are similar 
enough to warrant regulation.

“We’re not trying to control 

your app, but you are providing 
rides through a system,” Jones 
said. “There needs to be some form 
of licensing, appropriated insur-
ance. (There) needs to be appropri-
ate background checks on drivers.”

flock to South University from 
surrounding neighborhoods to 
dine at food establishments like 
The Brown Jug and Good Time 
Charley’s, to shop for University 
apparel or grab coffee at Espresso 
Royale between classes.

At night, bars along South 

University 
Avenue 
fill 
with 

customers who often opt to bar 
hop from one place to the other. 
A night could begin at the Blue 
Leprechaun, continue at Cantina 
and end up at Rick’s American 
Cafe.

As a result of the street’s loca-

tion, it is not only a cemented 
student destination, but also a 
significant economic engine for 
the city.

Perry Porikos, who graduated 

from the University in the early 
1980s and owns The Blue Lepre-
chaun, The Brown Jug and Study 
Hall Lounge on South Univer-
sity Avenue, as well as The Back 
Room on Church Street, said the 
area has consistently been a focal 
point of the city.

“It’s hard to duplicate some-

thing that South U. has,” he said. 
“It’s already established. It’s a 
walking distance from the major-
ity of the student body. And you 
cannot duplicate that. People 
have tried but it doesn’t work.”

While the nightlife is part of 

the South University neighbor-
hood’s popularity, it can be an 
inconvenience to those living 
close to the area. LSA junior Jona 
Hoxhallari, who lives in Univer-
sity Towers, said the weekends 
can sometimes be a problem.

“Being so close to the bars, it’s 

really loud on the weekends if 
I am trying to study or sleep or 
anything,” she said.

Hoxhallari said she chose 

to live there due to the very 
central location, which she said 
is excellent because it is close to 
restaurants and her friends, and is 
less than five minutes away from 
her classes.

However, she also noted that 

the rent is excessive and is a main 
reason why she would move away 
from the area.

In 2012, the average rents pric-

es in the area ran about $700 per 
month.

Porikos identified three main 

profit sources for both the city 
and for the South University’s 
neighborhood 
specifically 
— 

the University, the University 
of 
Michigan 
Hospital 
and 

Michigan football. He said he 
noticed a decline in the amount 
of business in the area during the 
past two years due to the recent 
performance of the Michigan 
football team.

“Business started going up 

when Jim Harbaugh came in,” 
he said. “I’ve seen right away 
that the culture, the attitude, the 
atmosphere 
already 
changed. 

It’s a positive energy that I felt 
right away as soon as I heard the 
announcement.”

Porikos noted that his overall 

clientele is about 60 percent stu-
dents, while the rest are Universi-
ty faculty and regular customers. 
He said the daily clientele varies 
depending on the time of day, 
with lunches dominated by Uni-
versity faculty and more regular 
customers.

“When you work with, in 

majority, the student body, you 
never have the regular restaurant 
lunch time which is going to be 11 
to 2. You might have people com-
ing in from 3 to 5 as a group. That 
fluctuates a lot and that hurts you 
a little bit with the labor because 
you never know,” he said.

He added that the strongest 

period of the year is football sea-
son and that the weakest is usu-
ally July to the end of August.

The heavy student presence of 

these areas is another reason why 
Porikos went into business on 
South University Avenue, as he 
wanted to be working with young 
people, which makes him feel 
young. He noted however that 
there are difficulties that come 
with this environment.

“Some of them you get really 

close (with). You start with them 
as a freshman. You become a 
friend or a father figure, what-
ever you want to call it, and then 
in four years they are gone. And 
then I have to start again. So it’s a 
challenge, too.”

South University Avenue is 

also the connecting corridor 
between the South University 
and Tappan neighborhoods.

Tappan

In many ways, the Tappan 

neighborhood exemplifies the often 
unclear spatial lines that separate 
the University and the city.

East Quad Residence Hall is 

across from Rick’s American 
Café; the Ross School of Business 
and the Law School are a few 
steps away from Dominick’s; and 
the School of Social Work is right 
on South University Avenue. 
The area also includes the Ford 
School of Public Policy and main 
city thoroughfares such as State 

Street and Packard Street.

Other important University 

organizations can also be found 
throughout the Tappan neigh-
borhood, including University 
of Michigan Hillel on Hill Street 
and a variety fraternities and 
sororities.

LSA 
junior 
Olivia 
King, 

who 
lives 
in 
the 
Tappan 

neighborhood, said the location 
is convenient due to its close 
proximity to campus buildings 
like the Law School and the 
Business School, as well as the 
Intramural Sports Building. One 
of the benefits she finds is the mix 
between student residents and 
permanent residencies.

“I like the location a lot 

because it feels safer because it 
is so close to campus,” she said. 
“I am always sure that (DPSS) 
will be just a block of my house. 
I think that was an attraction for 
me and my parents.”

King noted that sometimes the 

area gets a bit noisy, but beyond 
this small issue she hasn’t expe-
rienced many problems living in 
the neighborhood.

The large size of the Tappan 

neighborhood means that benefits 
and drawbacks of the location vary 
depending on the exact location.

LSA junior Emily Carl who lives 

in the Tappan neighborhood near 
Hill Street, also noted the location 
was a big plus. She said her house is 
about six minutes from her classes 
and has easy access to State Street, 
South University Avenue and 
Main Street.

“We are definitely paying for 

location,” Carl said. “The rooms 
are decent-sized and we have a 
huge kitchen and living room, but 
it is more expensive when I hear 
other people talking about their 
rent, who live a little bit farther 
off campus.”

In 2012, rent prices in the area 

averaged $700.

Tappan has also seen a sig-

nificant amount of the high-rise 
apartment building construction 
over the past five years.

The Landmark and Zaragon 

Place high rise buildings are more 
luxurious and pricier than other 
apartments and houses in the 
area, and the self-described “lux-
ury-student housing” ArborBLU 
apartments are currently under 
construction above Pizza House 
on Church Street.

With the heavy student pres-

ence, several traditional meet-
ing spots and a changing skyline, 
the neighborhoods are likely to 
remain a center of student life off 
campus.

three weeks before the festivities 
to develop precautions.

“Given the amount of scrutiny 

of Greek life in the recent events in 
this past semester, both the Panhel 
President Maddie Walsh and all 
the other presidents of all the other 
Panhellenic 
sororities, 
myself 

included, feel as though we need 
to ensure better responsibility 
and safety of all of our members,” 
Brown said.

She said the measures included 

offering breakfast and lunch at 
several of the sorority houses and 
creating “accountability partners,” 
matching girls to watch out for one 
another throughout the weekend.

However, efforts to ensure the 

weekend went smoothly extended 
beyond Greek life.

Joy Pehlke, a health educator at 

Wolverine Wellness and Universi-
ty Health Services, co-coordinated 
a St. Patrick’s Day committee. The 

committee included representa-
tives from the Dean of Students 
Office, the Center for Campus 
Involvement, Greek life, Recre-
ational Sports, Dance Marathon, 
Beyond the Diag, Residential Life, 
the University Department of Pub-
lic Safety, the AAPD and local bars 
and restaurants.

“Every St. Patrick’s Day, a num-

ber of different units on campus 
get together in a proactive measure 
to make sure that there is a coordi-
nated effort around some of these 
times that can be higher risk,” 
Pehlke said. “So St. Patrick’s Day 
for us is not any different, necessar-
ily, than Halloween can sometimes 
be, football tailgate Saturdays.”

Pehlke said the committee 

began meeting two months prior to 
St. Patrick’s Day to plan events for 
both the weekend before and the 
weekend after the holiday.

This year, the committee devel-

oped a theme for the activities sur-
rounding St. Patrick’s Day — March 
Radness. The initiative spanned 
from March 13 through March 21 

and included a canoe trip, obstacle 
course and rock climbing, among 
other activities.

Pehlke 
said 
the 
student-

designed Stay in the Blue app, 
which was launched in partner-
ship with the University Health 
System’s alcohol safety program 
in 2013 to help students track their 
drinking, recently saw a dramatic 
rise in downloads.

She said the app, which has been 

downloaded over 7,000 times to 
date, was downloaded 159 times in 
the week leading up to March 21.

Pehlke added that the initiatives 

put forth by the committee this 
year were not very different from 
those in past years.

“I don’t feel like anything we 

coordinated was vastly different 
… I think it’s more that every year 
it’s a little more of a moving target 
with different pieces of predict-
ability and unpredictability,” she 
said. “There are so many factors 
— the date, the weather, all sorts of 
things. We do the same proactive 
measures every year.”

a great network that will go oth-
erwise untapped,” Proppe said. 
“And so, the party leaders try to tap 
into as many networks as possible, 
which leads to a greater diversity 
of candidates. If you did not have 
the party system, you would see 
similar types of people running for 
CSG because no one would ever talk 
them into running.”

Shokar said this practice can be 

dangerous because students begin 
to be “tokenized,” valued for their 
networks rather than their talent.

“Tokenism is a big thing that 

happens on this campus,” Shokar 
said. “It’s an exciting thing when 
a person of color runs, or a woman 
runs, or a woman of color runs. It’s 
the most exciting thing for a lot 
of people, but that’s so sad that we 
should be excited that that’s so far 
from the norm.”

Moreover, though parties may 

allow diversity at the representa-
tive level, they do not guarantee 
that the executive committees are 
diverse. Both Proppe and Public 
Policy senior Carly Manes agreed 
that executive committees are 
often comprised of like-minded 
associates of the president and vice 
president.

Though Proppe said he didn’t 

find this problematic, Shokar felt 
differently. She discussed how, 
as speaker her sophomore year, 
she was the sole woman of color 
in a committee of white men and 
women. Her views were not always 
affirmed by her peers.

“Something I experienced time 

and time again in my two and a half 
years very involved in CSG, I’m in 
a room with four guys and we’re 
meeting and I’m the only woman 
and the only person of color. We’re 
all sharing our perspectives and I’ll 
share something and the response 
is, ‘That’s great, that’s interesting, 
but this is how we think and this is 
how we’re going to proceed.’ And 
it’s like, okay, so I’m interesting, but 
I’m not actually worth taking into 

account? That’s what it feels like.”

Campaigning pains

Some have found success run-

ning without a party backing. Uni-
versity alum Manish Parikh and 
Business graduate student Omar 
Hashwi, president and vice presi-
dent in the 2012-2013 academic 
year, were independent candidates.

Hashwi said his and Parikh’s 

campaigns, while ultimately suc-
cessful, was marred by slander 
and racism that a white candidate 
might not experience. For instance, 
he said a member of the Delta Phi 
Epsilon sorority sent a sorority-
wide e-mail accusing the two men 
of color of homophobia and anti-
Semitism. It was released to the rest 
of campus, requiring the candidates 
to clear their name.

“When I say it’s difficult for 

minorities to attain these high-up 
positions, I mean it, and mean it 
based on previous experiences,” 
Hashwi said. “It all had to do with 
my race and my religion, not my 
political beliefs or my beliefs on 
how to improve campus.”

Hashwi said the pushback he 

faced was often not based on his 
views, rather his identity as a Mus-
lim Arab American. He credited 
his support from Jewish, LBGTQ, 
Muslim, Arab and other communi-
ties to clear his name.

“It sounds cliché, but this was 

one of the moments where I real-
ized love truly is greater than hate,” 
Hashwi said.

During her candidacy in 2014, 

Manes found similar resistance 
as a result of her and her running 
mate’s, LSA senior Pavitra Abra-
ham, female identities. Within CSG 
and as president of Students for 
Choice, she has led campus-wide 
discussions on sexual health work. 
This work, she said, was minimized 
and mocked during the campaign.

Manes said she and Abraham 

were also called “the feminist can-
didates” in a derogatory fashion. 
Other coded language poked at 
their accomplishments and plat-
form; they were called idealists 
without a proven track record, not 
pragmatic.

“Holding liberal ideals and being a 

female is perceived as being idealistic, 
fluffy and intangible,” Manes said.

Such barriers might explain why 

there’s a negative 48-percent dis-
parity between numbers of females 
on campus and those leading CSG 
as president. With current Vice 
President Emily Lustig replacing 
Shokar, 2014-15 is the first academic 
year with a female vice president 
since 2006.

However, 
there’s 
indication 

that CSG has been more inclusive 
of females in the past. Females — 
two Black, one Asian and three 
white — held the vice presidency 
every year between 2002 and 2006. 
What’s missing now, according to 
the data, is the lack of a pattern of 
female representation. Until Shokar 
was selected by Make Michigan to 
run along current president Bobby 
Dishell, winning parties had not 
been in the habit of selecting female 
leaders, and students have not voted 
in women.

Yet there was a consensus that a 

more diverse student government is 
the most effective sort.

“We have a way to go in terms of 

gender diversity,” Proppe said. “The 
University of Michigan is a fairly 
diverse place, and I think people see 
a lot of value in electing somebody is 
a minority. So much of what we talk 
about here at Michigan is diversity, 
and how do we recruit more minor-
ity students to campus. Who better 
to talk than a minority student? I’m 
a white male, I can’t talk about how 
to get more Black students on cam-
pus, I don’t know that.”

Potential for change?

In favor of more diversity on 

CSG, Shokar said, “Disagreement 
can be a really beautiful thing.”

She and Manes both expressed 

their belief in the power of CSG, 
despite its flaws as an institution. 
It is what inspired them to run ini-
tially.

“I think when the student gov-

ernment has a lot more voices of 
people from different backgrounds, 
who have grown up differently, have 
experienced different challenges in 
their lives, you just come together as 

a stronger student government,” Sho-
kar said. “There’s so much more you 
can do because you have all of these 
different perspectives.”

Hashwi, who said he comes from 

a low-income background, said stu-
dents like him might be unable to work 
in CSG and represent a unique while 
supporting themselves in school.

A lack of communication CSG 

and campus organizations may also 
be at fault. Candace Curtis, presi-

dent of Latina sorority Delta Tau 
Lambda, said she’s never been con-
tacted by CSG, despite serving as 
a leader in seven different Latina 
organizations.

“I feel like we’re put on the back 

of priority list because there’s so lit-
tle in number of us,” Curtis said.

In a potential explanation, Proppe 

said he was not aware of any unified 
Hispanic student organization.

Nevertheless, CSG is students’ 

gateway to student organization 
funding and the administration.

“They may not represent them 

but the student gov does represent 
them,” Proppe said. “...If you don’t 
like it, you can work to change 
it. And that’s really the beauty of 
democracy. If you look at the current 
CSG leadership, and you say they 
don’t represent me, well, there’s a 
process to get involved and you can 
work to change that.”

J

ust before Spring Break, I had 
the opportunity to see Detroit 
— a city I have been familiar 

with my entire life 
— from a fresh per-
spective. Born and 
raised on the west 
side of the state, 
for me, Detroit has 
consisted of trips 
to the Joe Louis 
Arena or Tigers 
games, and noth-
ing more than a 
temporary 
des-

tination. 
How-

ever, for the past year and a half my 
sister has been working for Teach 
for America, teaching 10th and 11th 
grades at a charter school in Mid-
town. The other weekend, I finally 
had the opportunity to head west and 
experience Detroit through the eyes 
of young teachers immersed in the 
growth of the city.

As I sat nestled under a heat lamp 

in the urban oasis that is Midtown’s 
3rd Street Bar, my sister and her col-
leagues — many of whom had come 
from out of state — shared their 
experiences as postgraduates in an 
unlikely postgraduate destination. 
Making conversation, I asked their 
thoughts on the recent media cover-
age of James Robertson.

In mid-February, The Detroit Free 

Press published an article detailing 
the resiliency of Detroit native James 
Robertson. The piece explained how 
Robertson, now 56, has spent that 
last decade getting to and from his 
factory job 23 miles away in Roch-
ester Hills. Since his 1988 Honda 
Accord quit on him 10 years ago, he 
has been taking a bus part way there 
and partway home. In total, Robert-
son walks about 5,000 miles per year, 
a sum equivalent to two trips around 
the Earth. Quite obviously, Robert-
son was revered for his remarkable 
mental and physical toughness, as 
well as his dedication to a perfect 
attendance record at work.

In the weeks following the piece’s 

publication, 
Robertson’s 
journey 

to work became predominant in 
the spotlight of Detroit media. A 
GoFundMe page was set up to help 
Robertson 
financially, 
eventually 

reaching around $360,000, and Sub-
urban Ford in Sterling Heights donat-
ed a 2015 Ford Taurus to him after 
Robertson mentioned to the press he 
would like a Taurus because it’s like 
him: “Simple on the outside, strong 

on the inside.”

I remarked on this article to 

my sister and her colleagues, say-
ing I thought Robertson provided a 
delightful representation of Detroit’s 
enduring spirit and how nice that a 
story like his was receiving so much 
media attention. To my immediate 
surprise, the table became a caucus 
of scoffs and exasperated laughs, my 
comments provoking each to take 
another lengthy sip of their drinks.

My naïveté was shattered as they 

begun sharing with me their insights: 
“This is the worst thing that ever hap-
pened to him;” “The coverage was far 
from representative;” “Did you see 
the other comments on the Go Fund 
Me page?” I gave Robertson’s story a 
second look.

The Detroit Free Press’s story, 

“Heart and sole: Detroiter walks 21 
miles in work commute,” made men-
tion of the larger underlying issues, 
but I would argue it failed to drive 
home (no pun intended) or fully 
elaborate on the broken systems that 
subjected Robertson to 10 years of an 
extraordinarily arduous commute. 
Similarly, what resonated with the 
numerous readers from the commu-
nity who felt compelled to donate to 
Robertson were his individual jour-
ney and his personal triumphs — but 
Robertson is not an anomaly.

The GoFundMe site is now 

closed, but while the comments 
on the page were still visible there 
was a clear trend: about every 
other comment asked, “But what 
about me?” Between the comments 
commending 
Robertson’s 
spirit, 

there were just as many recount-
ing their daily struggles, the ways 
in which the systemic insufficien-
cies of Detroit have inconvenienced 
them and the money from which 
they could benefit. In fact, after all 
of his media attention, everyone 
knew about Robertson and every-
body wanted something from him. 
They had similar struggles and 
they wanted their cut. The neigh-
borhood started showing up on his 
porch with requests, some threat-
ening, and Robertson was forced to 
move to a private, undisclosed loca-
tion in the suburbs.

The subsequent articles covering 

Robertson’s newfound wealth, hap-
piness and Ford Taurus are uplifting, 
yet unfinished. Their coverage both 
features and inherently praises the 
skewed, misappropriated fix to one 
man’s problems, while essentially 

omitting mention of the larger sys-
tems that failed him (and continue 
to fail many citizens of Detroit) and 
excluding proposals for more expan-
sive aid solutions.

Robertson made this trek for 10 

years and, throughout the course of 
that decade, could not save enough 
to buy even any skeletal form of 
inexpensive transportation. Making 
approximately $2 above minimum 
wage at $10.55 an hour, Robertson 
clears no more than $320 a week. His 
previous landlord charged him $220 
a week for a room, and auto insur-
ance alone can top $5,000 a year in 
Detroit — some of the costliest in the 
United States. Despite his dedication 
to not only maintaining his factory 
job, but also excelling at it, Robertson 
could not even save enough for a car 
over the course of 10 years.

What’s more is that the broken 

metropolitan bus system not only 
fails middle-aged workers like Rob-
ertson, but they are also a disser-
vice to Detroit’s youth. Many high 
schools do not even have bus sys-
tems for their students, so if their 
parents are unable to take them 
to school, they have to rely on the 
same broken bus system that could 
only complete a fraction of Robert-
son’s commute.

An article for The Detroit Free 

Press mentions that, “For low-income 
commuters like Robertson, getting 
creative about bus service could help. 
Detroit’s bus system recently signed 
on to the federally funded Job Access 
and Reverse Commute, which pro-
vides door-to-door transportation for 
low-income workers to their jobs.”

Why would we choose to “get 

creative” about the bus system 
instead of creating solutions? In 
the wake of Robertson’s good for-
tune, let’s not forget to address the 
underlying factors.

The entire Detroit community 

came together to aid one man and 
to rewrite his narrative — and they 
did so because, in the word’s of one 
young teacher, they are “taken with 
Detroit.” They know they live in a 
vibrant, rejuvenating city in which 
loyalty runs deep, and sheer grit 
runs deeper. So what if instead, that 
same generous community could 
broaden their impact and bind

How to never leave college

A

s a freshman, I looked at the four years 
ahead of me. At the time, they seemed 
like an eternity, and I wondered what 

that time might bring. Then 
my years left at Michigan 
turned into months with 
cunning speed, and now 
in just five short weeks I’ll 
 

be graduating.

After last-ditch efforts to 

“forget” to sign up for classes I 
need to graduate failed, I face 
an almost certain catapult 
into the real world incred-
ibly soon. But I decided that’s 
tolerable, because I devised 
foolproof ways to never really 
give up college:

I’ll never stop learning. As the resident geek 

who counted down the days to the first day of 
school each September, I know I’ll continue my 
education after college, even if I don’t return 
to a formal college setting. Trading in my tal-
ented professors for Rosetta Stone may be a bit 
of a letdown at first, but deciding to learn to 
code without having to factor in the impending 
doom of a failing grade bringing down my GPA 
will allow me to explore more than just what’s 
comfortable and known.

I’ll never stop cheering on the Wolverines. 

After a controversial Big Ten expansion last 
year, I silently hid my excitement while others 
around me grumbled. Yeah, Maryland may be 
another imposter “U-M” we now have to deal 
with, but fortunately, College Park is located 
just a few metro stops away from the District 
of Columbia. You’ll find me singing The Victors 
in Byrd Stadium this October as Harbaugh gets 
yet another ‘W’ under his belt.

I’ll never stop making a few poor decisions 

each week. Laundry can still wait until the dirty 
clothes pile becomes a mountain with a mind of 
its own. Going to happy hour instead of the gym 
will seamlessly replace the “Skeeps over study-
ing” lifestyle pattern. Scrolling through my 
Twitter and Facebook feeds will forever remain 
my preferred procrastination technique.

I’ll never stop feeling awkward as I attempt 

to dodge people passing out flyers. A recent esti-
mate calculated 80 percent of a student’s time 
at Michigan is spent avoiding those passing 
out flyers in the Diag (joking). It’s now second 
nature for me to slip by the people at the gro-
cery store handing out coupons, and if I substi-
tute Central Campus for a busy intersection in 
Washington D.C., I’ll realize just how transfer-

able this skill is when I get approached to sign a 
petition while heading to work.

I’ll never stop walking everywhere. The one-

mile commute I became accustomed to while 
living four blocks down Washtenaw was rough 
at first, but it ended up being a great way to get 
outside and enjoy fresh air before being cooped 
up in a classroom for hours. After working 9 to 
5 each day, I’m sure I’ll look forward to walking 
home rather than riding in a packed metro car.

I’ll never stop being overcommitted. While I 

might not have Festifall as an option to discover 
new organizations and causes, finding an out-
let to give back will remain important to me. 
When my coworkers ask me to join their dodge-
ball team, my name will be on the sign-up sheet 
even though I’m fairly awful at sports involving 
a baseball diamond.

I’ll never stop watching a surprising amount 

of television shows. Some people love music. 
Some people love sports. I love Netflix.

I’ll never stop taking pictures of the frothy 

designs on the top of my lattes when I go to cof-
fee shops, then immediately feel the barista’s 
judgmental glare and pretend like I’m just using 
the calculator on my phone. If they didn’t want 
it photographed, they shouldn’t have made such 
a perfect little fern out of milk.

I’ll never stop consulting my friends when 

making every life decision, from what to wear 
to dinner to how to reply to an e-mail. My best 
friends will be the ones I talk to when one of 
us is having another quarter-life crisis. They’ll 
be the ones I send pictures to when I see some-
thing that makes me think of Michigan. They’ll 
be the ones who remind me that even though 
our time here is over, the things that made the 
last four years so great don’t really end when we 
leave Ann Arbor. Whenever I’m reunited with 
them I’ll be back at school, because it’s not the 
physical place that is making Michigan so dif-
ficult to leave (although I will miss you dearly, 
Zingerman’s). It’s the people.

I’ll never have to say goodbye to my college 

friends, because I don’t have college friends 
anymore. I have confidants and mentors, 
secret-keepers and partners in crime. We share 
inside jokes and memories that will remain long 
after we leave this city.

So it’s not “goodbye” I’ll be saying as we walk 

out of the Big House on May 2. It’s “see you 
soon.” And I’ll keep convincing myself of this 
in order to make it through the next five weeks.

If you had asked anyone who knew me in 

high school what I would major in, they would 
have told you political science. That, or wom-
en’s studies. I was (and still am) aggressively 
liberal, outspokenly feminist and always ready 
to debate with my classmates and teachers. I 
was confident, loud and transparent.

But when I got to college, something shifted. 

I was still energetic with my friend group, and 
I still posted all my political beliefs on social 
media, but I found myself withdrawing in the 
classroom. I participated, but by second semes-
ter, I rarely said anything particularly opinion-
ated, and I usually diluted my beliefs in order 
to seem normal. All my public speaking skills 
seemed to vanish, and during group projects, 
I let others take leadership roles that I once 
would have thrived in. Keep in mind, this all 
happened in LSA.

The decision to major in business came in 

waves. The first wave came by accident when 
I ran into Ross for shelter from the rain on the 
way home. It was late, but the Winter Garden 
was still bustling with well-dressed people 
who all looked busy, confident and important. 
Comparatively, I was a drenched and exhaust-
ed mess. It was all I could do not to stare in awe 
at the elegant architecture and sleek interior.

The second wave came when I met one of 

my really good friends, who helped shatter my 
image of the Ross student. The Ross Student 
is, according to many, arrogant, conceited and 
confident in his ability to make other people feel 
like idiots. But with every word of encourage-
ment and helpful guidance, my friend punched 
a hole through the picture of the Ross student.

The third wave, though, was a sort of revela-

tion. All my life, I was sure I would end up in 
government. It was just sort of assumed. But 
at some point early second semester, I realized 
that I had none of the in-between filled in. I had 
no idea how I was going to get from college to 
my end career. This might seem like the usual 
college crisis, but for someone who was so 
sure she knew who she was, it was terrifying. 
So I forced myself to imagine what the blank 
decades should look like. And for the first time, 
I allowed myself to think about what I would 
want to do besides working in the government.

Obviously, the answer I came to was busi-

ness. So I applied to Ross, and was accepted. 
The day that application results came back will 

always be one of the happiest days of my life. 
Armed with my bursting excitement and terri-
fied nerves, I walked into the first day of ori-
entation. I was ready both for new experiences 
and to tease out the confidence that I felt I had 
lost during freshman year.

I had a very different experience than the 

students interviewed in Zach Shaw’s article, 
“Rethinking Ross.” Yes, there were many 
opinionated students in my section who all 
wanted a piece of the action during our brain-
storming sessions. But this wasn’t alienat-
ing — it was inspiring. We quickly appointed 
a moderator who called on people so that 
we didn’t speak over one another, and soon 
found ourselves developing a series of great 
ideas. We didn’t win the video contest (in 
fact, we didn’t do nearly as well as we thought 
we would), but I think we all had a good time 
doing it. It was a bonding moment, not one for 
needless competition.

Speaking of competition, Shaw’s article 

made it a point to mention the Ross curve. The 
Ross curve has been a huge source of anxiety 
for me, and I’m sure that many others would 
agree. But the thing is, it’s the industry stan-
dard. More importantly, I completely disagree 
with the idea that it pits students against each 
other. I have never been turned away when 
I have asked for help and I have always been 
happy to give help even when it could, in the-
ory, negatively impact my grade. We’re a com-
munity, one of interesting and diverse people. 
Being competitive is part of the game, but it 
doesn’t necessarily get in the way of that sense 
of community.

The majority of my professors are intelligent 

and charismatic women who I see as role mod-
els, and at every turn I find new viewpoints and 
inspiration. The Business School isn’t flawless 
— as Shaw points out, our African American 
enrollment is low, we have more anxiety than 
we should and some of the students are, in fact, 
so arrogant that they make me want to pull 
out my hair. But, in the short time I’ve been a 
Business student, my confidence has skyrock-
eted, and I have developed real skills that I find 
myself using in everyday life.

Ross isn’t perfect, but I’m proud to call it 

my school.

RACHEL TUCKER | VIEWPOINT

In defense of Ross
A

ngelina Jolie Pitt, since 
publicizing her decision to 
undergo a prophylactic dou-

ble 
mastectomy 

around two years 
ago, has become a 
fascinating cypher 
between the medi-
cal field and the 
lay world. Found 
through 
genetic 

testing to carry 
a mutant of the 
tumor 
suppres-

sor gene BRCA1, 
Jolie’s 
estimated 

risks of breast cancer and ovar-
ian cancer were 87 percent and 50 
percent, respectively. In the face of 
such overwhelming risk, and hav-
ing witnessed her mother ultimately 
succumb to these devastating condi-
tions, Jolie refused to sit idly by while 
the demons of her past and potential 
future festered within her.

In Tuesday’s New York Times, 

she wrote another tender, intimate 
and inspiring piece titled “Diary of 
a Surgery.” In it, she discusses her 
second bout of preventative inter-
vention — this time, a laparoscopic 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In 
other words: the complete removal 
of her ovaries and fallopian tubes.

Her assumption of this role, of 

matriarchal medical translator to 
the masses, is far more profound 
than simply following in the cancer-
fighting footsteps of health activ-
ist Mary Lasker. Long perceived 
as the very social symbol of femi-
nism, estrogen is the fundamental 
“female” hormone that is produced 
in the ovaries. Jolie, in this recent 
procedure, has had the primary 
endocrine essence of her woman-
hood removed: estrogen.

So, in the wake of her procedure, 

Jolie asks us: What does it really 
mean to be female?

This is a tremendously dif-

ficult question; one that doctors 

and patients have struggled with 
enormously. William Halsted, as 
a stalwart advocate of the radical 
mastectomy, at the break of the 20th 
century, represented one side of 
the continuum. The surgery, which 
called for the complete eradication 
of cancerous tissue in the breast, 
often resulted in horrifying disfig-
urement of the female body (given 
the uncertain anatomical prolif-
eration of the cancer). Halsted thus 
submitted that womanhood was a 
virtue that was to be declared under 
the microscope.

The alternative end of the spec-

trum surfaced with the May 1960 
FDA approval of the first oral contra-
ceptive drug, Enovid. The drug had 
been previously approved by the FDA 
for menstrual disorders. “The Pill,” 
biochemically, is a humble combina-
tion of the two essential female hor-
mones, estrogen and progesterone. It 
acts by manipulating the menstrual 
cycle to prevent ovulation. In other 
words, women could now elect to 
alter their chemistry to control their 
biology, causing a revolution in sexu-
ality. In contrast to Halsted’s thesis, 
women were much more than how 
they looked under the microscope.

Now, back to Jolie’s question: 

What does it mean to be female?

Her answer is subtle. I read it as 

the following: so long as you feel 
female and are comfortably so, you 
are female. In any case, the interpre-
tation is subjective — a sea change 
in the history of social medicine. 
This is quite a message from the sex 
icon of a generation. One imagines 
that this resonates with the cohort 
of those who have felt the need to 
change their gender.

I would, however, be remiss if I 

did not extrapolate the themes of 
this piece out a little further, such 
that they may also apply to my own 
life, and to that of my fellow males. 
(Actually, I feel there is an entire 
library of books to be written on the 

themes here, but I’ll do my best.) I 
read Jolie’s broader question to soci-
ety is as follows: If you knew a piece 
of information that could change your 
future, would you do something about 
it? What cost would you bear?

This too is an extraordinarily 

important question. As advance-
ments in genetic medicine give us 
the potential to know more about 
ourselves than we ever thought 
possible, we must ask such difficult 
questions. If you were at risk for dia-
betes, would you change your diet? 
If you were at risk for lung cancer, 
as I am, would you stop smoking? If 
you were at risk for prostate cancer, 
would you do the extra colonoscopy?

And yet, among these immensely 

hard questions, perhaps the most 
profound of all of them are the three 
Jolie alludes to at the end of her arti-
cle: Who do I want to be in the future? 
Who do my genes say I am going to 
be? What can I do about it?

If nothing else, Jolie illustrates 

that there is something to be done to 
be who you want to be.

The landscape of medicine is 

changing 
dramatically; 
we, 
as 

patients, will be more informed 
and more capable to make our own 
decisions than ever before. “Fate” 
is more malleable than it has ever 
been. Medical options have never 
been greater. Genes have never been 
more visible. They have also, in 
some sense, never been less power-
ful. What a wonderful thing.

It’s our prerogative to learn about 

our medical options in order to 
carve out the futures we desire for 
ourselves. As Jolie says, “knowl-
edge is power.” How very sweet 
this irony is, given that the power 
to know and shape the future is 
the very fulcrum of the first “Tomb 
Raider” movie. Truly, the good guys 
can win after all.

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

The first thing you should 

know about English lecturer and 
renowned Ann Arbor musician 
Randy Tessier is that he’s full 
of life. He’s probably more 
passionate than you. He’s also 
got probably got a better sense of 
humor than 90 percent of people 
on campus — and he’s intelligent 
to boot. But the second thing 
you should know about Randy 
Tessier 
is 
that 
he’d 
never 

make you feel like you’re being 
preached to. He cares about his 
students too much for that — and 
more pointedly — he cares about 
their deeper understanding of 
books, language, music, college, 
the world. If there’s one thing 
Randy Tessier seems to say 
with his thoughts and actions, 
it’s this: Don’t be afraid to 
experience things.

Tessier is as much a part of 

the Ann Arbor music scene as 
he is a seasoned, well-respected 
lecturer at the University. He 
curates and facilitates the music 
of several venues in the area, and 
he fronts a handful of talented 
bands, like the Joe Cocker Trib-
ute Band and FUBAR. A gifted 
bassist and vocalist, Tessier 
can play anything from R&B to 
jazz, and he does so with twice 
the flaming, hypnotic energy of 
musicians that are half his age. 
Michael Betzold, in review-
ing a FUBAR performance for 
the Ann Arbor Observer, noted, 
“Seeing FUBAR is like sitting in 
on a jam session among discern-
ing pop-rock veterans. They play 
with energy and skill that would 
be the envy of far-better-known 
bands.” Betzold later added, 
“Tessier is a wild man – like a 
caged animal shaking his cell 
bars – and he’s put together a 
band of musicians’ musicians.”

On 
both 
Tessier’s 
group 

and 
solo 
albums, 
a 
keen 

eclecticism emerges, the kind 
of resourcefulness and respect 
for music history that’s fading 
in the medium. The sound of 
’60s heavyweights like Love, 
the Yardbirds and the Kinks 
can be heard in his carefully 
arranged horn sections, rhythm 
progressions and themes. Above 
all, his group of musicians seems 
to play with a preternatural 
understanding of one another’s 
tendencies and strengths and of 
the music they cherish, exuding 
chemistry and cohesion. Many 
of the songs are upbeat and full 
of sound, distinguished in their 
romping grooves that make you 
want to move a little (or a lot). 
This sense of buoyant optimism 
isn’t limited to Tessier’s music, 
however: He’s built his life 
around it.

After being expelled from 

high school in 1968 for creating 
and publishing an underground 
news 
publication, 
Tessier 

traveled around the country and 
lived the counterculture. He 
came to Ann Arbor to play music 
and be active in politics. When 
he had a son, he decided at the 
age of 36 to get his GED. And so 
he did. From there, he attended 
Eastern Michigan University 
in the hopes of going to nursing 
school. But the science courses 
disillusioned him, so he chose 
English 
instead. 
With 
the 

grades and ambition to back 
them, he applied to English 
Ph.D programs all around the 
country. 
Michigan 
accepted 

him, and five years later, at the 
age of 46, Tessier earned his 
Ph.D and was given a position 
in the English department. He’s 
been here ever since.

The Michigan Daily: We’ll 

begin with a general question. 
Where did music start for you?

Randy Tessier: Well, you know, 

the cool thing would be to say that 
I listened to Bo Diddley and Chuck 
Berry. But I found I could learn 
about those guys by listening to 
the Beatles in 1964. They changed 
everything in our generation. 
My love for music really started 
with them, the Rolling Stones, 
the Kinks, Animals, the British 
Invasion. 
Although 
my 
mom 

had records like jazz and easy 
listening, and there was always 
music around the house.

TMD: 
You 
mentioned 
the 

British Invasion. I felt like when I 
was listening to FUBAR especially, 
I heard the huge influence of the 
Rolling Stones. Do you see that at 
all, or what do you see in FUBAR?

RT: I do, and FUBAR likes to 

do obscure stuff, too. Danceable 
songs. But not stock stuff. No 
“Stairway to Heaven,” and if 
we were to do Led Zeppelin, it 
would be from Physical Graffiti. 
But there are a couple songs we 
do by Love, Arthur Lee’s group. 
There’s a difference between being 
derivative and being influenced, 
you know, so we try to do a range 
of things. I love the ‘60s sound, and 
I love songs that are complicated.

TMD: Joe Cocker’s influence 

has a place there, too, right?

RT: Well, I love Joe Cocker, but 

someone came to me with the Joe 
Cocker Tribute Band idea. And he 
said my voice suited it well. I can 
also sing Creedence Clearwater 
Revival, Rod Stewart, there are 
a few voices in my wheelhouse, 
so to speak. But the Joe Cocker 
idea fell into my lap, and it’s been 
a gas. That’s something you can 
practice in the car. Each time I 
listen, I understand his nuances 
a little more, and I’m getting it 
down. We’re going to be playing 
again soon, you’ll have to come 
see us in town.

TMD: Absolutely. I actually 

wanted to touch on your live 
performances and the talent you 
bring to a venue. Do you have a 
strategy when you play?

RT: I actually don’t like to sing 

a song the same way twice, in any 
capacity or over any amount of 
time. I like to improvise with my 
voice. Improvisation just grooves. 
When I think about it within the 
rock genre, I think about the very 
best – “Dark Star” by the Grateful 
Dead, Frank Zappa’s Hot Rats, the 
Allman Brothers. It’s grooving. 
I love to mix it up between jam 
songs and tight two-or-three-
minute songs.

TMD: How important is it to 

engage with the audience?

RT: The audience feels like 

part of the band, especially with 
FUBAR. I don’t see the audience 
and band as separate. I know a 
lot of musicians that don’t make 
that distinction. When I play, I’ll 
go out into the audience, I’ll have 
people come up to play, stuff like 
that, you know. It’s a tribal, primal 
stomp that everybody participates 
in. I don’t want to sound like Jim 
Morrison, but it’s got cadences and 
all that jazz.

TMD: Do you think that alters 

the music?

RT: Well, Ann Arbor’s always 

been known for its counterculture, 
so in some ways no. It’s always 
attracted public intellectuals with 
things to say and who love music. 
It’s a very savvy audience, a very 
savvy scene.

TMD: How do you balance 

your love of music with your love 
of academics?

RT: It’s the perfect fit, really, 

it’s not too difficult. I teach 
writing, and we read stuff about 
music and social issues and 
things like that. Music shouldn’t 
be didactic in that sense. If I had 
to travel and juggle music with 
teaching, though, it might be a 
bit of a struggle to balance the 
two, but that’s the same with any 
job. It’s been a good blend. I’ve 
never really trumpeted my music 
within the University and I never 
felt like I had to. Music is the most 
immediate universal language.

TMD: It’s really interesting 

to hear an English professor 
describe 
music 
as 
more 

immediate than language.

RT: It’s true. I mean, the best 

language is musical.

TMD: Agreed. I’m hoping we 

can change gears a bit here, if 
that’s OK with you?

RT: Certainly.
TMD: The first time you and 

I met, I remember you told me 
that in the early 2000s you had a 
serious bout with cancer.

RT: 
Yeah, 
2007. 
Non-

Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Recovered 

in full, it’s been gone for eight 
years.

TMD: I wanted to ask about 

the song “Chemotherapy” on 
your solo CD, Hold Me Close. 
What has that song meant to you?

RT: Well, I decided I wanted 

to write a song about my 
experience, and I wanted it to 
have disturbing, real lyrics with 
an up-tempo sound to reflect 
the disconnect I felt. You have to 
listen to the lyrics to understand 
it. It’s about me sitting there in 
the hospital bed observing the 
people around me – a beautiful 
woman, a diva, a guy without an 
eyelid, someone who’d broken his 
ribs by rolling over in bed.

I never play it live. And I 

thought I’d write more songs 
that came out of that experience, 
but there’s a period in it where 
you’re 
not 
doing 
much 
of 

anything. Just dealing with it. 
Cancer changed me in many 
ways. I come from that old “Mad 
Men” generation, insensitive, 
Alpha Male, you know. Cancer 
took it away, all that control, and 
that was good. The important 
thing is that I never thought I 
was going to die. And now I’m in 
the best health I’ve been in in a 
long time.

TMD: How did it affect your 

music?

RT: I play better now than I 

did before I had it, how cool is 
that? That’s one of the beautiful 
things about music, something 
I really love. With practice, 
dedication, and time, you can be 
better at 60 than you were at 30. 
And that’s how I hope to stay.

Randy Tessier is a noted Ann Arbor musician.

A2’s musical legacy

By GREGORY HICKS

Daily Arts Writer

“Everybody’s in shorts? That 

sounds like Ann Arbor.”

The city is hitting the 50-degree 

mark, and Martin Kierszenbaum 
knows just how University of 
Michigan students react to the 
slightest hint of the new season.

Kierszenbaum is the Grammy-

nominated producer and song-
writer known as “Cherry Cherry 
Boom Boom,” the founder of Cher-
rytree Records, the senior A&R 
executive of Interscope Records 
and, most importantly, a fellow 
Michigan Wolverine.

Well, perhaps not most impor-

tantly. That’s quite a list of achieve-
ments to compete with, after 
all. The alum has done A&R for 
Enrique Iglesias, Sting, Marilyn 
Manson and produced nearly one 
third of Lady Gaga’s first record, 
The Fame, which was released on 
his label, Cherrytree Records.

Cherrytree Records — home to 

artists Ellie Goulding, LMFAO, La 
Roux, Sting and more — celebrated 
its 10th anniversary this past year, 
and while the label has officially 
been up and running for more 
than a decade now, the concept 
began many years prior, right here 
in Ann Arbor. While at the Univer-
sity, Kierszenbaum earned a triple 
major in music, communications 
and Spanish literature.

Of those three degrees, music 

sits at the forefront of the all-
star alum’s career. At the age 
of eight, Kierszenbaum met the 
musical instrument that would 
lead him to his interest in the 
industry: the piano.

“I was lucky that I grew up in 

East Lansing and had a great piano 
teacher in the neighborhood,” 
Kierszenbaum 
recalled. 
“She 

required us to take theory concur-
rently with our piano lessons, so I 
had a theory class and playing class 
every week ... I started to under-
stand the building blocks and how 
it all related to each other. That got 
me into writing music, and I was 
really drawn to pop music.”

Kierszenbaum’s achievements 

could easily be credited to his 
parents for tolerating the hectic 
household that became something 
of a musical tornado alley for the 
children of the family.

“I don’t know why, but my par-

ents let me set up my band and 

the equipment in the living room, 
and they didn’t care if it was there 
for months. They were super cool 
in that way. They were scientists 
and worked at Michigan State, but 
they were really tolerant. My sister 
was usually with a quartet in the 
basement, while I was there in the 
living room with a drum kit — lit-
erally there for three months.”

Rather than set up his own 

music conservatory, the Cher-
rytree Records founder began 
developing an interest in the com-
mercial music business — even if 
only to initially preserve his own 
musical merits.

“I was a musician and a song-

writer, so I quickly started to 
realize in high school when I 
was organizing a band that it was 
really easy to get ripped off by club 
owners. I was like, ‘You know, 
this feels bad. I’m writing a song, 
I’m rehearsing and then the club 
doesn’t pay us. I’ve gotta figure out 
how this all works.’ ”

That was when Kierszenbaum 

began digging for clues.

“So I wanted to find out more 

about where the interaction of 
music and business is because, if 
not, I was going to be at the mercy 
of whomever as a musician and a 
writer,” Kierszenbaum continued, 
“and then I thought, ‘Well, it 
seems like the center of it all is the 
record label,’ you know? They’re 
the ones that take a chance on the 
artist and invest in them … So I 
thought, ‘I think I want to be in a 
record label.’ ”

A wise thought, surely, but with 

one major obstacle: There were 
no record labels in Ann Arbor for 
the then-college student Kierszen-
baum to join. Then, Kierszenbaum 
decided to create his own record 
label in the city — Arb Recordings.

“We started (Arb Recordings), 

and were recognized with an 
office in the Union, which meant 
we could post banners on the Diag, 
and we basically used all students 
to run our label.” Kierszenbaum 
said. “We had photographers from 
East Quad, recording engineers 
and we used the East Quad musi-
cal studio … We’d record stuff 
there and in our dorm rooms.”

The label became home to 

Kierszenbaum’s own rap group, 
Maroon, as the label sprouted on 
campus. After Maroon released 
its first record on Arb Recordings, 
door after door began opening for 

Kierszenbaum, having acquired 
this newfound knowledge of label 
foundation and management — 
knowledge that is still applied to 
this day at Cherrytree Records, 
according to Kierszenbaum.

And the label was covered 

from head to toe with Ann Arbor 
memorabilia.

“I remember naming it Arb 

because it was kind of like an ode 
to Prince’s Paisley Park (Records) 
and I was a big Prince fan, so I was 
like, ‘You’ve got Paisley Park, we 
have the Arb, that’s our park.’ ”

The logo creation for Arb 

Recordings was not a story to be 
ignored either.

“Do they still give out tickets like 

crazy in Ann Arbor?” Kierszen-
baum asked. “I used to get ticketed 
all the time on my car senior year 
… so I just took the tree from inside 
the logo on the ticket, and I made 
that the first label. And then we 
started getting some attention and 
I thought we might get in trouble 
for that … so we changed it to look 
like a very kind of generic, iconic 
tree.”

There truly is an idea hiding 

around every corner — or in this 
case, slapped to every car wind-
shield. And despite being such a 
small idea initially, the tree con-
cept grew into Kierszenbaum’s 
future platforms.

“Really that’s kind of the gen-

esis of the Cherrytree (Records) 
logo. When I started the Cherry-
tree label I thought it was kind of a 
continuum of the stuff I learned at 
Arb (Recordings), so I made it look 
like that.”

Kierszenbaum started Cherry-

tree years after developing a solid 
musical footing here in Ann Arbor. 
He took many of the same courses 
that University students take now 
(be it History of Opera or Java-
nese Gamelan Performance). He 
walked through the same Arb. He 
posted fliers on the same Diag.

He probably lost a fortune in the 

same parking fees.

In his current music and busi-

ness, you’ll find these bits and 
pieces of Ann Arbor because 
Kierszenbaum 
planted 
many 

ideas here — some that he took 
with him, and others that he left 
behind. And in this past and pres-
ent, Martin Kierszenbaum has 
quite a lot to be proud of, and 
Michigan is proud to have been a 
part of his venture to success.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Senior guard Nicole Elmblad led Michigan with 14 rebounds in the Wolverines’ win over Toledo on Monday.
Michigan hosts Missouri

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team refuses to let its 
season end.

Monday night, the Wolverines 

powered 
through Toledo 
on the road — 
a dicey affair, 
considering 
they had nine 
losses 
away 

from 
home 

during 
the 

season.

Thursday 

night, though, 
Michigan (8-8 
Big Ten, 20-14 
overall) will get another chance 
to extend its postseason life when 
it hosts Missouri (7-9 SEC, 19-13 
overall) at Crisler Center in the 
WNIT Round of 16. It will also 
be Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico’s 100th game at the helm of 
the program.

“After we lost in the Big Ten 

Tournament, 
we 
refocused,” 

Barnes Arico told WTKA Radio 
on Tuesday. “Our kids still 
want to continue to play, win a 
championship and hang a banner, 
something that’s never been done 
for Michigan women’s basketball.”

The winner will move onto 

the quarterfinals to face either 
Southern Mississippi or Eastern 
Michigan, the latter of which the 
Wolverines routed early on in the 
season.

Against Toledo, Michigan’s 

underclassmen came through 

to score 47 points — only one 
of which came from a starter. 
The leading seniors, meanwhile, 
failed to make much of an impact. 
Senior forward Cyesha Goree 
battled foul trouble early in the 
first half, while senior guard 
Shannon Smith struggled to keep 
possession.

Though Goree had a strong 

first-round 
performance, 
she 

was limited to just four rebounds 
against the Rockets, well below 
her 10.6 average. Though she 
failed to be much of a difference 
maker, 
senior 
guard 
Nicole 

Elmblad cleaned up around the 
glass with 14 rebounds. Against 
Missouri, though, Michigan will 
need its leading rebounder back 
in action to pave way for victory.

Another key to success in the 

postseason for the Wolverines 
is their shooting behind the arc. 
Monday, 
freshman 
Katelynn 

Flaherty and sophomore Siera 
Thompson scored 25 and 20 
points, respectively. The guards 
also combined for six 3-pointers, 
bringing Flaherty’s total to 76 on 
the season, passing the single-
season record set by Thompson 
last year. As for Thompson, 
she became the only player in 
program history to post back-to-
back seasons with 70-plus triples.

The underclassmen have been 

finding their stride as practice 
has become more competitive 
and the seniors have gotten some 
rest.

“Late in the year, we got a little 

flat and our seniors got a little 
worn down, because they were 
playing so many minutes,” Barnes 

Arico said. “The last couple of 
weeks, the opportunity to mix up 
practices to give our younger kids 
an opportunity to get some playing 
time and have them improve has 
worked out really well.”

This year, the Tigers’ had their 

best finish to the regular-season 
since the 1984-85 season, and 
earned their first postseason win 
since 2003 with a first-round win 
over Northern Iowa.

“They try to wear you down, 

they hold it sometimes through 
the entire shot clock, they’re a 
disciplined team and they’re 
used to playing on the road,” 
Barnes Arico. “They’ll be a tough 
matchup and a different type of 
team than we’ve faced recently.”

According to Barnes Arico, 

much of her team’s postseason 
success will depend on being 
able to host more games, which 
is determined by attendance 
averages at the discretion of the 
WNIT.

If 
the 
Wolverines 
win 

Thursday, the may even host the 
quarterfinals like they had in 
2010. That year, they hosted each 
game, eventually falling in the 
semifinals.

As Michigan continues to 

ride a lot of momentum, though, 
Missouri 
is 
experiencing 
a 

postseason high. A win Thursday 
will cement its longest postseason 
run in program history. So when 
the Tigers arrive in Ann Arbor, 
it won’t matter how much of 
the postseason has been in 
the Wolverines’ favor, because 
Missouri wants a banner of its 
own.

‘M’ uses big fourth 
inning, routs WMU

Wagner’s complete 
game, two homers 
power Wolverines 

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan softball team 

was left with nothing to show for 
three baserunners through three 
innings.

But 
Michigan 
sophomore 

left fielder Kelly Christner and 
freshman 
first 
baseman 
Tera 
Blanco changed that, starting 
the bottom of fourth inning with 
a bang. After three innings of 
struggling at the plate, the two 
Wolverines went yard to capture 
the first lead of the game.

And after the fourth inning 

strike Wednesday at Alumni 
Field, Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 
29-4 overall) never looked back 
in its 8-2 victory over Western 
Michigan.

The Broncos (6-14) started with 

right-hander Erin Binkowski in 
the circle, and though she put 
forth a valiant effort through 
three innings, the Wolverines 
eventually caught up to her.

In the fourth inning, Christner 

sent her home run flying to the 
right-field bleachers, and Blanco 
tore the stitching off a full-
count pitch, sending it over the 
center-field wall into Ray Fisher 
Stadium. Michigan proceeded 
to bat through the order, scoring 
four more runs and forcing two 
pitching changes in the process.

“We were trying too hard to 

do too much with the pitching,” 
Christner said. “Whenever it’s 
not as quick as we’ve been seeing 
(against other teams and our own 
pitchers), we have to be more 
patient, looser and let it come to 
us. And that’s what we started 
doing in the fourth.”

The 
four-run 
onslaught 

featured two more RBI for 
Christner, one for freshman third 
baseman Taylor Swearingen and 
another for senior left-hander 
Haylie Wagner.

Blanco 
credited 
Wagner’s 

reassuring performance on the 
defensive end for catalyzing 
the Wolverines’ confidence and 
motivation at the plate in the 
fourth. Wagner dealt from the 
circle, recording seven strikeouts 
and allowing only one hit to 
Western Michigan through five 
innings.

“I was just really working my 

ladder,” Wagner said. “And that’s 
just making them bite and chase 
the (pitches) off the plate. I was 

trying to move the ball and spin 
it.”

Her only setback came in the 

top of the sixth inning, when the 
Broncos showed promise against 
Michigan’s ace.

But Wagner quickly recovered 

to force a pop fly and end the 
inning.

Junior center fielder Sierra 

Lawrence further relieved the 
pressure, 
roping 
a 
two-run 

homer over the right-field wall 
in the bottom of the sixth inning, 
padding the Wolverines’ lead.

Wagner went on to strike 

out the side in the seventh, 
solidifying her complete game. 
She posted a season-high 10 
strikeouts and allowed just four 
hits in her seven-inning outing.

“She 
pitched 
well,” 
said 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“She had a number of pop-ups (to 
the circle) because her curveball 
jammed them up. I’m going to 
guess that the pitches they hit 
to the fence were over the plate. 
Sometimes that curve ball on 
righties doesn’t get in on them, and 
when it doesn’t, it’s dangerous.”

Blanco’s home-run ball may 

be staying in the outfield of Ray 
Fisher Stadium for the night, but 
Michigan made sure that was the 
only remembrance of Western 
Michigan left behind in Ann 
Arbor after the first three innings.

Wolverines own full counts

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

When the count goes full 

in softball, a duel ensues. The 
pitcher and batter engage in 
a staring contest. The batter 
chokes up on her bat, protecting 
the ever-so-important plate in 
front of her. The pitcher winds 
up with more pressure on her 
than any previous pitch.

The outcome of the pitch has 

many possibilities, but the count 
either remains full or drops back 
to 0-0 — it’s do or die.

Full count is arguably the 

tensest moment in softball. But 
when the Michigan softball 
team faces the high-pressure 
moment, it doesn’t see it as 
one to be feared. Instead, the 
Wolverines hold their nerves 
and deliver.

“Our kids don’t get down 

when the count isn’t in their 
favor,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “It’s a credit 
to their ability to stay in one 
pitch.”

In 
Wednesday’s 
matchup 

against Western Michigan, the 
Wolverines had the most success 
with the count full than any 
other count. They ended the 
day 3-for-5 with the count full, 
including a home run and two 
walks. The stout average on full 
count helped the team to an 8-2 

victory.

After the first two full-count 

at-bats led to an error and a 
groundout, Michigan started 
to show why it’s dangerous on 
the 3-2 count. None of the three 
Bronco pitchers could close out a 
full count in their favor.

In the next full-count at-bat, 

freshman first baseman Tera 
Blanco got all of the payoff 
pitch, hitting a home run over 
the centerfield wall, landing in 
an empty Ray Fisher Stadium. 
It might have even hit an 
outfielder if a 
baseball game 
was in action.

Blanco’s 

solo 
homer 

came 
two 

at-bats 
after 

Michigan 
scored 
its 

first 
run 
in 

the 
fourth 

inning 
from 

another 
solo 

blast by sophomore left fielder 
Kelly Christner. The home runs 
jolted the Wolverine offense, as 
it scored six runs in the frame.

The next four at-bats that 

reached full count alternated 
between singles and walks. 
Christner and freshman catcher 
Aidan Falk both rocketed singles 
up the middle, giving a clinic on 
how to have quick hands while 

swinging the bat. Freshman 
infielder Amanda Vargas and 
junior right fielder Kelsey Susalla 
both earned walks, practicing 
careful patience at the plate.

“Honestly, with a full count, 

I love it,” Christner said. “(The 
pitcher) doesn’t want to walk 
you, for the most part, in any 
situation. So it’s kind of that 
confidence approach, like she’s 
going to give you something to 
hit, so just attack it.”

When the pressure was at 

its height, Michigan showed 

poise at the 
plate. 
When 

a 
Wolverine 

entered a full 
count against 
a 
Western 

Michigan 
pitcher, 
they 

made 
the 

most of their 
opportunity 
and got rid of 
any 
tension. 

The individual victories led to 
an overall team win.

Performing 
well 
in 
full 

counts may benefit Michigan 
in the future, especially when 
it is facing the country’s best 
pitchers. If the Wolverines can 
hit this well when they’re in 
high-pressure situations, they’ll 
be well-suited for postseason 
drama.

The Michigan Daily | michigandaily.com | Thursday, March 26, 2015
the b-side

T

hursday 1 p.m. Sixth floor, North Quad, 
just in time for office hours — except this 
time, I’ve arrived at the Screen Arts and 

Cultures Department to pick my teachers’ brains 
about their stories instead of mine.
I arranged to meet with Veerendra “V” Prasad, 
who I had for my introductory screenwriting 
class last semester; then Daniel Shere, who is my 
lecturer for Screenwriting I: the Feature Script; 
and finally, the esteemed James “
Jim” Burnstein, 

the father of the University’s screenwriting pro-
gram. There was a certain generational feeling 
as I walked down the hall, a student of Shere and 
Prasad’s, who in turn were former students and 
success-stories of Burnstein’s.
I sat up straight and wide-eyed as they each 
spewed out their insight about the industry — an 
extensive three-hour synthesis nuanced in ways 
only decades of experience could have detailed. I 
first met with Burnstein, who strung on anecdote 
after anecdote so mellifluously that I became a 
child at story hour rather than an interviewer with 
interrogations. During his time as an undergradu-
ate and graduate Shakespeare-infatuated English 
language and literature student, the University’s 
screenwriting program was nonexistent. It was 
only until his professor proclaimed, “If Shake-
speare were alive today, he’d be a screenwriter,” 
and upon reading Polanski’s “Macbeth” script, 
Burnstein fell in love with creating a visual lan-
guage — words that could translate into emotions 
and actions before our very eyes.
Consequently, Burnstein taught himself the art 
of the script and progressed quickly — selling the 
third screenplay he ever wrote — a fact he recount-
ed with shocking nonchalance, as if the craft were 
simply second nature. However, just weeks before 
CBS was to start shooting the TV drama he wrote, 
they pulled the show to the young Burnstein’s 
devastation.
However, a failed production disseminated Burn-
stein’s name in the industry. While tipsy at a party, 
Michigan native and Academy Award-winning 
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke convinced him to 
go big, or go home (and later, to go Blue). Thus 
sprung an idea based on his poignant personal 
experience teaching Shakespeare to soldiers at 
the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michi-
gan — what became “Renaissance Man” starring 
Danny DeVito. It was then that Burnstein learned 
the importance of rewriting — a concept he would 
later use to construct the University’s screenwrit-
ing program — and one he would eventually pass 
onto Shere and Prasad as students in his class. Af-
ter three years and four drafts, “Renaissance Man” 
finally sold, proving the validity of the rewriting 
tactic.
Since, Burnstein’s practice of “what if” galvanized 
his 2013 wartime romance “Love and Honor” 
starring Liam Hemsworth, as well as his current 

works, “Naked Shakespeare” and “Palio,” origi-
nal screenplays about a Florida strip club turned 
Shakespeare theater and a Chinese animation set 
in Italy —“bizarre” concepts he never would have 
imagined could come to life.
“I never give up. If I have a good script … I have 
some projects where I say, ‘It’ll get made, maybe 
not in my lifetime, but it’ll get made,’ ” Burnstein 
proclaimed.
His patience eventually landed him an agent who 
allowed him to establish a fruitful screenwriting 
career from his Plymouth home. Conveniently, his 
alma mater also persuaded Burnstein to return as 
the creator and director of what is now one of the 
top screenwriting programs in the country — posi-
tions he has now held for about 20 years. Though 
he has no formal film education at the university 
level, he still decided to return to revamp his roots, 
building the program for future students that he 
dreamed of during his time as a student.
I finally bid Burnstein farewell – a chanceful “see 
you next semester” — as I moved down the hall to 
Shere and Prasad’s shared office. Despite holding 
a third full-time job as a father at home with three 
sick sons, Shere was his usual enthusiastic self — 
emanating a sophisticated passion from his voice 
and body language every time he spoke about film.
Shere’s fascination with movies started during 
his childhood days. In our three-hour class every 
Thursday night, he may spend half an hour raving 
about the storytelling brilliance of “Star Wars,” the 
film series that glittered his juvenile memories.
“My youth was seeing those movies in the theaters, 
and then living with them, and having the little 
play figures and re-imagining it,” Shere noted.
A Detroit native in the pre-digital age — an era his 
son refers to as “the 1800s” — Shere entered the 
University on a quest for wisdom and answers — a 
philosophy major provided a theoretical founda-
tion that he channeled into writing, putting his 
childhood imagination to good use.
“(Burnstein’s classes were) where I gained my 
confidence to try my hand at (screenwriting) 
professionally.” Shere reflected. “He really chal-
lenged us to raise our game. He never coddled us … 
He really instilled in us this work ethic of rewrite, 
rewrite, rewrite.”
Burnstein’s solid encouragement — and Shere’s 
brewing interest-turned-obsession with script 
writing — prompted him to audaciously leap to 
Los Angeles after graduation where he continued 
to live for seven years. He laughed as he admit-
ted he was pitifully paid sub-minimum wage at a 
humdrum agency job “getting coffee for the guy 
who gets coffee.” He has recounted his tale of toil 
often to our class, but what sticks out each time is 
his unrelenting dedication to his passion project — 
the script he started in Burnstein’s class — arriving 
two hours early and staying several hours late each 
day to rewrite.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

The music video for Flor-

ence and the Machine’s “St 
Jude” off of 
How 
Big, 

How 
Blue, 

How 
Beau-

tiful is sim-
ply a perfect 
match to the 
slow, mourn-
ing 
sounds 

of the record. 
The music video moves flu-
idly, keeping a delayed pace 
in keeping with the song, and 
together they stir up an eerie, 
yet soothing, feeling.

The scene is set at dusk, and 

if not, at dawn. Viewers fol-
low Florence through several 
scenes in what appears to be 
an impoverished rural neigh-
borhood, filled with several 
New Testament references 
that I don’t understand, in 

addition to obvious allusions 
to the cross. While the video 
might be unclear in regard to 
what allusions or symbolism 
is present, just sensing that 
there is something deep in the 

video makes it all the more 
powerful.

“St Jude” closes as it begins, 

with a massive swarm of birds 
moving through the sky.

TRAILER REVIEW

If there’s a checklist for ani-

mated movies, “Home,” the 
latest 
fea-

ture 
from 

DreamWorks, 
does its best 
to check all 
of them off 
during 
its 

first 
trailer. 

Outsider trying to make it in a 
new world? Anthropomorphic 
animals? An odd-couple pair-
ing of said outsider with some-
one else, in a relationship from 
which they’ll both undoubtedly 
emerge as better people? Check, 
check, check. The film pairs 
an isolated alien (Jim Parsons, 
TV’s “The Big Bang Theory”) 
and a young girl (Rihanna, 
“Battleship”) on a journey that 
apparently may threaten the 
human race, but at the very least 
will uproot the Eiffel Tower. 

The 
animation 
is 
impres-

sive enough, though it doesn’t 
appear significantly (if at all) 
better than anything else 
recently released. The humor 
of the film looks like it will 
ride heavily on the outsider-

unaware-of-human-customs 
gag, which might just do it for 
you if you’re a fan of Jim Par-
sons, but otherwise will most 
likely seem worn out. “Home” 
hits theaters on Mar. 27.

Mac Demarco is my 
dad, my friend, etc.

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Mac DeMarco is my dad 

because he is. Because he’s 
24 and I’m not so that makes 
sense. Because he has a gap 
in his front teeth and I had 
braces before. Actually he can 
stick a cig into the space and 
I’ve done that with my upper 
and lower lip when I’m drunk. 
Mac is my dad because my last 
name is McClure and those 
two are too similar for him not 
to be. Because he showered 
while pooping and I’ve done 
both of those things separate-

ly. Because it seems he doesn’t 
bathe ever and I’m a shower guy 
anyway. Because he wears knit 
caps to hide his dirtiness and 
I used to wear those when the 
weather called for something 
else. Mac is my dad because 
dads — the good ones — are cool 
and funny and talented and he’s 
most of those things. He’s my 
dad because he called his studio 
Jizz Jazz and I know what one 
of those means.

Mac DeMarco is my friend 

because a good dad is a friend. 
He’s my friend because he made 
“Salad Days” and that record 
has “Chamber Of Reflection” 

on it. That track is good because 
the verses and refrains are 
Hemingway-simple. He’s my 
friend because he knows I like 
simple because I might be sim-
ple. That track is about being 
alone and I get that feeling 
sometimes and it’s nice. He’s my 
friend because he likes friends 
but privacy too and I do too. 
He’s my friend because he takes 
me places like on his China 
tour or to my imagination or to 
my weird side. And that’s what 
good friends do. They take you 
to China unless you can’t go. 
Then just go to your imagina-
tion or your weird side. It’s fun 

and Mac knows this because 
he’s fun. I think you’ll like him 
but don’t be alarmed when he 
farts on your hand. That means 
he just doesn’t hate you and 
maybe he’ll like you. He’s my 
friend because he riffs on stupid 
stuff until it’s no longer stupid.

Mac DeMarco is my relief 

because he googled Teen Slut 
when he was eight and I googled 
something more embarrassing 
last night. He’s my relief because 
he tells jokes like Mitch Hedberg 
did and that dude was funny and 
weird and unbathed too. He’s my 
relief because he hates Chipotle 
and I eat it so often that I should 
hate it. He’s my relief because he 
once said he wants to make out 
with Jerry Seinfeld and I want to 
make something with Jerry Sein-
feld. He’s my relief because he self 
deprecates and that doesn’t go out 
of style. Mac is my relief because 
he made a love song about his 
smokes and I love love songs most 
of the time. He says “I’ll smoke 
you ’til I’m dying” and I think he 

means it and admire his commit-
ment. He’s my relief because he 
says “Obama, man, shit’s fucked 
up” in a fake stoner voice and it’s 
funny because he’s probably a 
lefty. He’s just joking and I too do 
fake stoner voices. He’s my relief 
because his music makes me feel 
like I’m in a hammock and school 
got canceled tomorrow.

Mac DeMarco is not my dad 

because he never sexed my mom. 
He would but she wouldn’t. He’s 
not my dad because he’s not ready 
for a kid or me. And that’s cool. 
Dads don’t make languorous rock 
‘n’ roll earworms; they make din-

ner reservations. Mac wouldn’t 
make dinner reservations because 
he likes In-N-Out Burger and 
that place doesn’t take reserva-
tions right now. He’s not my dad 
because my real dad would prob-
ably listen to Real Estate first. Or 
Kurt Vile. Or The War on Drugs. 
And those bands rock but Mac 
makes effortless seem cooler than 
it already is. My real dad would 
stop and ask, “Who’s this?” once 
he learned to loosen up and work 
less. Mac DeMarco is not my dad 
because my dad needs to listen to 
Mac because it would be good for 
him. Good to relax to.

Mac DeMarco is many things 

but he is not my dad. But now that 
I think of it maybe he is my friend. 
A friend is someone you can be 
weird with. And I always feel that 
when I’m with Mac and my head-
phones that my real dad bought 
me for Christmas.

Mac should thank my real dad 

for buying those headphones. 
He just can’t sign the card, Your 
Son’s Dad.

Before Shere knew it, a mere 

eight months into bumbling 
around L.A., he sold “Goat 
Cheese is Dead” to United 
Artists. 
Though 
his 
script 

eventually ended up shelved next 
to with Wheezy the Penguin 
(much like the fate of Burnstein’s 
first project), “Goat Cheese is 
Dead” lodged his foot in the 
door — and more importantly, it 
inspired him to continue pushing 
dark, 
personal 
experiences 

from pejorative to positive. His 
original script was based on his 
own heavy metal garage band 
during high school.

“I think a lot of comedy 

frankly comes from things that 
were once really painful — so, 
at the time, playing that gig that 
no one showed up to,” Shere 
chuckled as he recounted the 
experience. “I think there’s a 
sort of empowerment to that 
when you can laugh at yourself 
or experiences that were cruel or 
demeaning,” he added.

Shere 
has 
since 
written 

commissions for monster studios 
such as DreamWorks and Sony. 
Quite recently, he co-wrote the 
animated feature film “Epic.” 
Though 
he 
had 
extensive 

experience in the L.A. scene, like 
Burnstein, he eventually relocated 
back to the University where it 
all began. Now, as a lecturer of 
more than 10 years, he becomes 
animated whenever he teaches 
Michael 
Arndt’s 
“Little 
Miss 

Sunshine” or talks about “Toy 
Story 3.” He always makes time in 
class for personal anecdotes about 
spontaneous 
encounters 
with 

Dustin Hoffman at L.A . coffee 
shops and run-ins with Paula 
Abdul at fro-yo. It’s clear teaching 
has become an ancillary passion.

“Just as Jim was able to 

guide me into this new world of 
screenwriting, I think that in my 
years here, I’ve been able to do that 
with some students.” Shere said. 
“There’s always something very 
special to me about this place.”

Looking into the future as 

a writer, Shere has an array 
of projects including a new 
animation, a live-action comedy, 
a bit of music — and perhaps 
even a novel. Though he is solely 
a 
screenwriting 
teacher, 
he 

encourages all his students to 
experiment with the multifaceted 
aspects of film — an openness to a 
variety of mediums he attempts to 
emulate himself.

“Screenwriting was never the 

only thing I saw myself doing … I’m 
open to other kinds of writing, and 
I just want to continue to explore,” 
Shere explained. “The main thing 
is to just develop a wide range of 
interests and to be able to look at 
things from different perspectives 
… I think creativity is a lot more 
fluid than people maybe assume.”

Shere’s main pieces of advice 

drew 
from 
his 
liberal 
arts 

background, 
highlighting 
the 

importance of growth by opening 
up to new challenges. Especially 
in today’s fluxing screenwriting 
world, he stressed how writers 
only have one thing to fall back on: 
trusting good stories.

“You just have to really follow 

what excites you, what inspires 
you as a writer … Don’t just aim at 
where you think the marketplace 
is, but aim at what entertains 
you. The vast majority of people 
who try their hand at writing or 
directing fail. You may as well 
fail being true to yourself,” Shere 
advised. “For me, ‘Goat Cheese is 
Dead’ is what I wanted to do,” he 
chuckled.

“The other great thing about 

being a philosophy major is 
… you’re pretty much free in 
terms of exploring,” he finally 
added. 
“There’s 
nothing 
that 

sounds crazier when that’s your 
background. It’s not like I had an 
engineering degree or anything.”

Just then, Prasad entered their 

office, a perfect segue into his even 
more egregiously atypical start 
to screenwriting. Prasad laughed 
heartily when I brought up his 
electrical engineering past, an 
undergraduate major his parents 
nudged him into. However, his 
unrelenting 
Martin 
Scorsese 

obsession that stemmed in high 
school prevailed and carried him 
through today.

Pensive 
and 
meditative 
in 

nature — Prasad beamed a quieter 
enthusiasm than his colleagues, 
but he also unraveled a reel of 
insight I had never heard before. 
A graduate of the University’s 
1997 class and an alumnus of 
Burnstein’s 
first 
screenwriting 

classes like Shere, Prasad is now 
a University lecturer. Indian by 

descent and Ann Arborite by 
birth, Prasad grew up before the 
emergence of prominent Indian 
filmmakers, a period he refers to 
as “pre-M. Night Shyamalan.”

“The only Indian people I knew 

were either engineers or doctors,” 
he explained. “The only Indian 
person I would see on TV was Apu 
from ‘The Simpsons.’ ”

It wasn’t until halfway through 

college when he decided to pursue 
this elusive passion, with few 
footsteps to follow except the 
guidance of a passion rooted from 
youth. It was his discontent with 
the stagnation of stability that 
launched him into the lucrative, 
but engaging world of film – 
landing him among the prestigious 
American 
Film 
Institute’s 

graduating class of 2000.

“A lot of people (said), ‘Oh, 

it’s really brave of you to follow 
your dreams,’ but it never really 
seemed that way. It seemed like 
that was the natural thing for me 
to do,” Prasad recounted. “The 
risk would’ve been more staying 
in engineering and knowing I 
would’ve been unhappy.”

Upon obtaining a degree from 

one of the most renowned film 
schools in the world, he was asked 
by a Michigan doctor to write 
“Ocean of Pearls,” the feature film 
that first grounded him into the 
working industry.

“I’m 
a 
big 
believer 
in 

bisociation,” Prasad said, “This 
idea that creative breakthroughs 
come from putting two things that 
don’t necessarily belong together, 
together.”

In this respect, he refers to 

“Ocean of Pearls,” which attempts 
to find common thematic ground 
between Sikhism and health care. 
Prasad, raised Hindu, is interested 
in his religious roots as creative 
inspiration. His current projects 
include 
“Head 
on 
Straight” 

which is about a gay Indian man’s 
arranged marriage, as well as 
a ghost story set in India and 
another feature linking classical 
Indian dance and piety — tales 
which all amalgamate his cultural 
and spiritual background with 
other challenging aspects of life.

It is this dedication to telling 

unique ethnic stories that he 
credits to Burnstein for spark-
ing within him 18 years ago. He 
recalled his script for his intro-
ductory 
screenwriting 
class 

about a taxi driver in a college 
campus, and how he had initial 
qualms about creating an Indi-
an protagonist. However, Burn-
stein motivated him to “write 
what you know,” giving way to 
Prasad’s aspirations to blaze an 
industry trail for his heritage.

“There weren’t a lot of people 

making stories about (Indian 
characters). I always want to 
do something that hasn’t been 
done before — whether it’s 
telling a story in a new way or 
telling a story that hasn’t been 
told before,” Prasad said.

In his pursuit of originality, 

he has since been a story 
consultant 
for 
Lionsgate 

Entertainment and a features 
juror for the Traverse City 
Film Festival, among other 
achievements. However, after 
seven years in Los Angeles, 
the Midwest called him back — 
with an offer from Burnstein at 
their alma mater, and with the 
understanding that Burnstein 
himself 
made 
a 
successful 

career remote of Hollywood.

“I love L.A., but I think the 

one downside of being there 
is sometimes it breeds this 
culture of waiting — waiting for 
other people to tell you you can 
make a movie,” Prasad says. “If 
I could go back in time and give 
myself advice, I would’ve just 
jumped into making things.”

After reading a New York 

Times article about college 
students finding sugar daddies 
to help pay for tuition, he became 
the director of the feature-
length film, “Consideration,” 
which grew from modest roots 
into a project that inspired the 
filmmaking fire within many 
other students.

He 
recounted 
his 
initial 

mission: “Start writing, shoot it 
in a year with whatever money 
we can find, with whatever 
locations we can find, with 
whatever script we have.”

“Consideration” 
has 

since been premiered at the 
Cinetopia International Film 
Festival in Ann Arbor and at 
the Massachusetts Independent 
Film Festival. The feature will 
soon be available for streaming 
rental online.

Recently, after bouncing his 

career between Ann Arbor and 
Los Angeles, Prasad made the 
move to Chicago for a fresh com-
munity. Just like he once doubled 
in engineering and screenwrit-
ing in college, he now wishes to 
simultaneously teach and pursue 
independent filmmaking proj-
ects. Despite a lengthy weekly 
commute, 
he 
mentions 
how 

he’d like to direct more, perhaps 
working projects into his curri-
cula or shooting stories pertinent 
to campus issues.

“There’s so much content out 

there so diversity is survival, 
Prasad stated. “You need to dis-
tinguish yourself in some way. 
So write the story you want to 
see that no one else will make.”

Burnstein 
reflected 
on 

Prasad’s humble beginnings: 
“(Prasad’s) first five pages were 
the first five pages I ever read in 
that class. I remember reading 
it and saying to my wife, ‘Holy 
shit, if they’re all this good ... ’ ”

While Prasad and Shere 

may have been more modest 
about their accomplishments, 
Burnstein openly showcased his 
pride for his students, boasting 
accolades of achievements he 
had a part in initiating. For both 
Shere and Prasad, Burnstein’s 
introductory 
screenwriting 

and rewrite class summed up 
the entirety of their formal film 
education. Like Burnstein, they 
have all taken their winding 
paths 
to 
the 
intersection 

between pursuing — and now 
passing on — their passion for 
screenwriting.

“Most writers are in a hurry 

to fail, which means they send 
their first draft out.” Burnstein 
continued, “If I had sent my 
first draft out ... I’d never get 
to meet Prasad, Dan Shere … 
I’m not teaching at Michigan. 
If I had not learned that you 
don’t send something out before 
you’re sure it’s good …” he trails 
off in contemplation.

It is this drive and perspective 

Burnstein offers that has paved 
his speedway to success. His 
career has soared because of his 
refusal to submit anything less 
than his highest potential. He 
understands how every aspirant 
must pay their toll to the top. He 
understands how success in the 
film industry — or any field, for 
that matter — is dependent on 
his patience and perseverance.

Burnstein took a breath. He 

had spoken for about an hour 
straight. Despite his affinity for 
loquacity, he uttered one final 
phrase of wisdom: “Learn to 
rewrite.”

SCREENWRITING
From Page 1B

When people I know say they 

don’t like rap music, the first artist 
I usually play for them is Common. 
It’s not that Common is the greatest 
rapper of all time, but when he’s 
at his best, Common is a shining 
example 
of 

how hip hop 
can be so much 
more 
than 

just a genre 
of music, and 
he can serve 
as 
a 
stark 

counterpoint 
to 
the 

commercial 
hip hop that 
many think defines the genre 
completely. 
Through 
socially 

conscious lyrics and innovative 
instrumentation, 
the 
most 

intelligent and most ambitious 
hip-hop artists of today are, by 
extension, the best artists in all of 
music. No genre is at the moment 
more relevant, more transcendent 
or more important than hip hop.

The most obvious example of 

Common’s transcendence is in the 
song “Glory,” his Oscar-winning 
collaboration with John Legend 
that closed out the film “Selma.” 
It’s the first end-credits song that 
I’ve ever seen keep an entire the-
ater in its seats for its entire dura-
tion, and it’s the first performance 
at the Oscars that I’ve ever seen 
get the standing ovation that it 
did. Common’s verses on the song 
aren’t technically incredible, but 
his clear enunciation gives spe-
cial emphasis to the issues he raps 
about, connecting the struggle 
we’ve just seen in “Selma” to 
recent protests in places like Fer-
guson, MO.

But Common has been doing 

this long before “Selma” was 
released. Back in 1994, he spoke 
out about the mainstreaming of 
gangsta rap and the fall of social 
consciousness in hip hop with 
“I Used to Love H.E.R.” And 
though his career has been slightly 
inconsistent since that breakout 
song, his best records (led by 

2000’s Like Water For Chocolate) 
stand up as classics of afro-
centricity, experimentation and 
intellectual lyrics. I play Common 
for people who claim to dislike hip 
hop because his earnest message 
and old-school style make him 
like a more poetic Motown song — 
learned and likable.

I’m not by any means saying that 

hip-hop artists have to be acces-
sible to all to be valid. Cutting-edge 
artists like Young Thug or Migos 
are great because they’re weird, 
unique and unafraid to hide it. 
Their songs are relevant not just 
because they’re bangers, but also 
because they break down musical 
boundaries. I mean, have you ever 
heard any sound that even remote-
ly resembles Young Thug’s voice?

What also shouldn’t be lost is 

that hip hop will always be a Black 
genre of music, and most people 
who claim not to “get” it are white. 
Hip hop shouldn’t have to dumb 
itself down to appeal to white 
Middle America — as we’ve seen 
with artists like Macklemore and 
Iggy Azalea, those attempts can be 
painful. However, more accessible 
artists like Common, The Roots 
or A Tribe Called Quest — artists 
who make clear, easy-to-listen-to 
music but don’t compromise their 
messages — can serve as gateways 
to the rest of hip hop, a genre that 
music fans need to accept and listen 
to because it’s the most vital and 
important genre of this generation.

I used to think that Kendrick 

Lamar thought he was too good for 
hip hop. In the past, he’s insisted 
on calling himself a “writer” 
not a rapper, and while yes, he’s 
undeniably a writer, the “rapper” 
label is so much more important. 
By 
calling 
himself 
a 
writer, 

Kendrick seemed, in a way, to be 
disavowing his blackness. It was as 
if rap wasn’t a valid enough means 
of expression for one of its brightest 
stars, and he sought the credibility 
of a more “respectable” art form.

To Pimp a Butterfly changed all 

of that. From its opening sample of 
Boris Gardiner’s “Every N*gger is 

a Star” and its name-checking of 
Black icons like Kunta Kinte and 
Marcus Garvey to its covering 
of seemingly every aspect of the 
Black American experience (or 
at least as many as he could fit 
in), Kendrick’s latest release is 
one of the defining albums of our 
time, made even more important 
because 
of 
its 
overwhelming 

blackness. To Pimp a Butterfly 
completely redefined the most 
relevant genre in America today, 
and even if you claim to dislike rap, 
if you’re a fan of any kind of music, 
you need to listen to this album. 
Hopefully, it will lead to your 
discovery of tons of other fantastic 
hip-hop artists.

From longtime legends like 

Public Enemy to great turn-of-
the-century artists like Black 
Star and modern torch-carriers 
like Killer Mike, hip hop’s 
political and social relevance has 
lasted for over three decades now, 
and even become more powerful 
as the clout of other genres has 
waned. It used to be rock music, 
with protest songs from artists 
like Bob Dylan or Crosby, Stills, 
Nash and Young, that dominated 
the charts and captured the 
nation. But it has been a long time 
since any band with the ambition 
and creativity of The Beatles, U2 
or even Radiohead in its prime 
has been on the national radar. 
Now, with bluesy leaders like 
Jack White and The Black Keys, 
rock is a genre that’s constantly 
looking backwards, where its 
artists think all the “real” music 
is. By contrast, hip hop is a 
perpetually 
forward-thinking 

genre that features some of the 
smartest, most creative minds 
of today. Even if what you hear 
on the radio doesn’t strike you 
as particularly great, you owe it 
to yourself to dig a little deeper 
to find the pulse of modern 
America’s best music.
