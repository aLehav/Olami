Theta Xi president
conciliatory as
inquiry continues
By PETER SHAHIN and
YARDAIN AMRON
Daily News Editor and
Daily StaffReporter
On Thursday, LSA senior Eric
Quang, president of the Universi-
ty's chapter of Theta Xi, issued a
statement apologizing on behalf
of his fraternity for a Facebook
party event associated with his
chapter entitled, "World Star
Hip Hop Presents: Hood Ratchet
Thursday," a name many deemed
to be racist and derogatory.
Quang wrote that while the event
was "created and emblazoned
with the name of our fraternity,"
it was not "the result of a chapter
decision, vote, or endorsement."
Earlier Thursday, The Michi-
gan Daily reported the fraternity
was facing scrutiny as many stu-
dents of color were offended by
the Facebook event, which many
viewed as degrading toward
women and parodying of black'
culture, referring to "bad bitch-

es," repeated use of the word
"ratchet," gang references and a
twerking contest.
The event was canceled after
a meeting between Quang,'the
coordinator of the Bias Response
Team, Dean of Students Laura
Blake Jones, members of Greek
Life and the Interfraternity
Council. Jones, coordinator of
the University's bias response
team, lodged a formal complaint
against the fraternity after out-
cry from students.
The story has drawn wide-
spread media attention as the
University has moved swiftly to
investigate and resolve the inci-
dent.
According to an e-mail
obtained by The Michigan Daily,
the apology was forwarded by
Jones to a University listserv
which included the Office of the
University President; E. Roys-
ter Harper; vice president of the
Division of Student Life; LSA
senior Tyrell Collier, speaker of
the Black Student Union; Uni-
versity spokeswoman Kelly Cun-
ningham; Lester Monts, senior

Annual blood drive
starts Nov. 4,
aims to collect
2,500 pints
By CHRISTY SONG
Daily StaffReporter
Looking -for another way to
beat Ohio State?
The 32nd annual Blood Battle

blood drive between the two
schools starts Nov. 4 and runs
through Nov. 27 leading up to
the rivalry football game Nov.
30 at the Big House.
Blood Drives United, a stu-
dent-run volunteer organi-
zation, is holding the annual
competition and hopes to col-
lect 2,500 pints of blood over the
course of the battle.
Two to four blood drives
will be held every day at differ-
ent locations during the three-

week period. In order to find out
where the locations will be, stu-
dents are encouraged to look on
the Red Cross website and enter
the sponsor code "Go Blue."
The drives will be held at
North and Central Campus
locations including the Uni-
versity Unions, the School of
Education, the School of Social
Work, Michigan Stadium and a
number of residence halls.
There are several different-
aspects about this year's compe-

tition than previous drives. For
instance, this year there will be
more of an emphasis placed on
drives taking place at student
residence halls.
BDU is 'also focusing on
involving non-eligible groups,
including MSM, men who have
sex with men, through sponsor
drives and promoting a petition
to change the policy.

Profs: ACA web woes
just a minor bump

GOING BANANAS RESEARCH

Experts more
concerned with
lack of education
By YARDAIN AMRON
DailyStaffReporter
While national media
outlets continue their exten-
sive coverage of Healthcare.
gov's websitewoes, Univer-
sity health and information
experts are not channeling
their energy into worrying
about these issues. They are
confident difficulties sur-
rounding the site's rollout
will be resolved in the future
and are more concerned
with the potential problems

and promises of the Afford-
able Care Act itself.
A month after a botched
launch, the website's prob-
lems continue to cause much
frustration. More than 20
million Americans have vis-
ited thehealthcareexchange
website, but only about
700,000 have succeeded in
completing applications for
insurance. Even fewer have
actually received coverage.
Visitors have complained
about long waits, irksome
glitches and unhelpful cus-
tomer service when just try-
ing to gain access and sign
up for the site.
The blame is widespread.
Republicans have blasted
the Obama administration

for negligently launching
the site before it was ready,
the White House hasblamed
the private contractors hired
to create the site and the
contractors have targeted
each other.
But Public Policy Prof.
Helen Levy, who special-
izes in health policy, sees the
blame game as shortsighted.
"A few years from now, all
this is just going to look like
a bump in the road," Levy
said.
Levy said the current out-
cry parallels the delayed and
glitch-ridden rollout of the
Medicare, Part D website
in late 2005. When mainly

abuse rises
among
teenagers
University studies
show potential
for chronic abuse
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Nearly two million Ameri-
cans are addicted to prescrip-
tion opioids, a family of drugs
that includes the commonly pre-
scribed Vicodin and OxyContin.
Two recent University studies
further demonstrate the preva-
lence of these painkillers among
adolescents and their potential
for leading to chronic substance
abuse.
University of Washington pro-
fessor Lauren Whiteside - who
was the primary researcher in
one of the studies during her
postdoctoral research fellowship
at the University Injury Center -
said while adults are more likely
to be addicted to prescription
opioids, teens were a key group
to examine for prevention.
"What makes this age group so
important is that it's the highest
initiation of nonmedical use of
opioids," Whiteside said. "This
age group is important to target
for primary prevention before
they start nonmedical use."
Whiteside emphasized that
teen prescription painkiller mis-
use is a public health problem.
Conducted by a team from the
University Medical School and
Injury Center, the study led by

Appeals judge

NEW YORK (AP) - A fed-

that found the New York Police
Department's stop-and-frisk
policy was discriminatory and
took the unusual step of remov-

Mayor Rob Ford
previously said
video did not exist
and denied scandal
TORONTO (AP) - Toronto
police said Thursday they have
obtained a video that appears to
show Mayor Rob Ford smoking
a crack pipe - a video that Ford
had claimed didn't exist and has
been at the core of a scandal that
has embarrassed and gripped
Canada for months.
Police Chief Bill Blair said
the video, recovered after being
deleted from a computer hard
drive, did not provide grounds
to press charges. Ford, a populist
mayor who has repeatedly made
headlines for his bizarre behav-
ior, vowed not to resign.
Speaking outside his office
door, Ford said with a smile: "I
have no reason to resign." He
said he couldn't defend himself
because the affair is part of a
criminal investigation involv-
ing an associate, adding: "That's
all I can say right now." Toron-

to police discovered the video
while conducting a huge surveil-
lance operation into a friend and
sometimes driver suspected of
providing Ford with drugs.
Ford faced allegations in May
that he had been caught on video
puffing from a glass crack pipe.
Two reporters with the Toronto
Star said they saw the video, but
it has not been released publicly.
Ford maintained he does not
smoke crack and that the video
does not exist.
The scandal has been the fod-
der of jokes on U.S. late night
television and has cast Canada's
largest city and financial capital
in an unflattering light.
Ford was elected mayor three
years ago on a wave of discontent
simmering in the city's outlying
suburbs. Since then he has sur-
vived an attempt to remove him
from office on conflict-of-inter-
est charges and has appeared
in the news for his increasingly
odd behavior. Through it all, the
mayor has repeatedly refused to
resign and pledged to run for re-
election next year.
But the pressure ramped up
on Thursday with all four major

dailies in the city calling on Ford
to resign.
Cheri DiNovo, a member of
Ontario's parliament, tweeted:
"Ford video nothing to celebrate
Addiction is illness. Mayor
please step down and get help?"
. On Thursday, Blair said the
video of the mayor "depicts
images that are consistent with
those previously reported in the
press."
"As a citizen of Toronto I'm
disappointed," Blair said. "This
is a traumatic issue for citizens
of this city and the reputation of
this city."
Blair said the video will come
out when Ford's associate and
occasional. driver, }Alexander
Lisi, goes to trial on drug charg-
es. Lisi now also faces extortion
charges for trying to retrieve the
recording from an unidentified
person. Blair did not say who
owned the computer containing
the video.
Blair said authorities believed
the video is linked to a home in
Toronto, referred to by a con-
fidential informant as a "crack
house" in court documents in
Lisi's drug case.

Since the glitch prevented

in local politics. His grandfather
ran for mayor as a Republican,
his father ran for City Council as
a Democrat and his uncle ran as
a Libertarian for City Council.
DeVarti said part of his inspiration
stems from a desire for "beating
that slew of bad luck" that led to
his family members' defeats.
DeVarti also got a taste of the
local campaign trail in 2009 when
he went door-to-door for incum-
bent City Council member, and now
opponent, Stephen Kunselman.

The Mixed Use Party platform
centers on rezoning the city into

which criticized the fraternity
and its "incredibly offensive party
theme."
In his statement, Quang high-
lighted the diverse backgrounds
of his chapter and apologized to
"all of the members of our stu-
dent body, including those of all
ethnicities, and to all women."
He accepted responsibility for
the "harmful consequences of
our inaction to promptly stifle
the event's communication."
The University's chapter of
Theta Xi is working with the
fraternity's national headquar-
ters and the University's admin-
istration to reeducate chapter
members and the student body
to prevent similar incidents from
occurring.
In an e-mail to University stu-

dents Thursday morning, Harper,
Blake Jones and Mary Beth Seiler,
director of Greek Life, wrote that
the party invitation "denigrated
all women and African Ameri-
can/black identified people."
Although the e-mail did not
identify the fraternity by name,
Harper, Jones and Seiler wrote
that their behavior will not be
tolerated as it contradicts the
University's core values and
expectations.
The three also wrote that the
University is working with the
fraternity's national headquar-
ters, which has put restrictions on
the fraternity until it completes a
full investigation of the incident.
Collier, the speaker of the Black
Student Union, said in an inter-
view late Thursday that he was

pleased with the University's ini-
tial response to the incident, but
that more action was needed in
the future.
"I think that it was an appro-
priate response and it's a first
step," Collier said. "There needs,
to be things to follow that. I
appreciated it for the fact that it
shows campus that they are han-
dling the situation and they're
not (overlooking) it, but it's a
first step and it's definitely not
enough."

Although the Mixed Use

"I'm not that worried about l

DeVarti added that part of
his personal platform will be to
address student housing in local
neighborhoods. He said he hears
complaints about student high-
rises downtown, but is concerned
that Ann Arbor policies prevent
students from living elsewhere.

he said. "That being said, if we
really want to maintain a diverse

redouble our efforts and make a
commitment to bringing up the
lower segments of our community
so they can continue to live here."
DeVarti is confident in both his
ideas and his party's, and he hopes
that this confidence - combined
with his freshness to the politics
scene - may give him an edge.
"In one way, yes, I have less
experience. I've dealt with fewer
people. I haven't dealt with as
many issues," he said. "The fact
that I haven't been around for so
long gives me perspective. That's
the flipside to youth and inexperi-
ence."

TEENS
From Page 1
Whiteside showed that one in
10 teens in the University of
Michigan Hospital's emergency
department had used prescrip-
tions for nonmedical reasons.
Prescription painkillers were
the focus of the study.
Most of the admitted emer-
gency-room patients were seek-
ing help for a sprained ankle, a
fever or another routine, non-
drug-related ailment. Notably,
only 15 percent of the patients
misused drugs that a doctor
prescribed; Whiteside said
this may indicate they used
their parents' or friends' left-
over medications. A negligible
amount of teens purchased the
pills online.
Data on prescription drug
abuse is typically gathered in
schools, and most often reflects
that about eight percent of
teens have misused prescrip-
tion drugs. This recent survey
shows a slight increase to 10
percent.
A study from the University's
Institute for Social Research
demonstrated that prescrip-
tion drug abuse starting in
adolescence can lead to long-
term abuse. About a third of
the opioid-abusing 18-year-olds
studied continued misuse into
their early- to mid-20s. Twelve
percent of those aged 18 to 24
reported non-medical use of opi-
oids.
Both Whiteside and Sean
McCabe, a research associate
professor in the University's
Substance Abuse Research Cen-
ter who led the latter study,
found that teens mostly used
these drugs to experiment or get
high.
However, young adults who
continually use prescription
drugs non-medically often
engage in other destructive
behaviors.
Compared to those who never
reported nonmedical use of opi-
oids, those surveyed were four
times as likely to engage in binge
drinking in the two-week period
prior to their engagement in the
survey and 17 times more likely
to report marijuana usage in the
year prior to the survey, McCabe
wrote in an email.
There's a slightly higher
likelihood for those on public
assistance to use these drugs
non-medically, Whiteside said.
Suburban and rural teens are
also more likely than inner-city
teens to misuse prescription
drugs.

The longitudinal study
McCabe led included responses
over a four-year period from
27,268 young adults from the
national Monitoring the Future
study, which has been conducted
annually by the University since
1975 to survey trends in illicit
drug use. It will be published in
an upcoming issue of Addiction.
More than 475,000 emer-
gency department visits in 2009
concerned misuse of prescrip-
tion opioids. That's double the
2004 rates, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
The explosion in use - and
misuse - of prescription pain-
killers is often publicized and
Whiteside cited a move by the
Institute of Health in 2003 as a
major contributor to the surge
in use.
In 2003, the Institute of
Health began to emphasize
more aggressive treatment of
pain. One result of this was left-
over medication, which allows,
for instance, teens to scavenge
through their family medicine
cabinets for unused pills.
Since 2007, the IMS Institute
for Healthcare Informatics has
reported that hydrocodone -
more commonly known as Vico-
din - is the most-prescribed
drug in the United States.
Since then, however, Whi-
teside said both the medical
and political , communities
are regulating prescriptions.
Every state now has automated
prescribing systems, which
ensures that patients receive
potentially addicting prescrip-
tions only when needed. Doc-
tors, she added, are becoming
increasingly aware of the prob-
lem.
Whiteside expressed the
importance of screening inter-
ventions, especially for teen-
age boys, who are particularly
unlikely to get annual check-ups.
"I think that primary care is
a good place to talk about sub-
stance use, but I don't think
that regular primary care alone
would solve the problem," Whi-
teside said.
McCabe added that prescrib-
ers play a key role in limiting
painkiller abuse. He stressed
the need for careful prescription
of medication, monitoring of
patients' usage and, when need-
ed, referral for substance-abuse
treatment.
"Indeed, an evidence-based
protocol for assessment and
education among prescribers is
needed: one aimed at preventing
non-medical use, ensuring safe/
secure storage and dictating safe
disposal."

" ICC postpones trial of Kenyan president

African Union
claims it needs
even more time to
prepare for case
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - The International Crimi-
nalCourtonThursdaypostponed
the trial of Kenya's president on
crimes againsthumanity charges
until February, but the African
Union said that's not enough
time and stepped up pressure for
a one-year deferral.
The judges made the
announcement while an AU min-
isterial delegation was meeting
behind closed doors with mem-
bers of the U.N. Security Council
in New York to press the case for
the yearlong deferral of the trials
of President Uhuru Kenyatta and
Deputy President William Ruto
on the ground that the stability
of Kenya, is at stake.
An AU letter on Oct. 12

requesting a deferral said the
delay would give Kenya time to
beef up counterterrorism efforts
in the country and East Africa.
Ethiopia's foreign minister,
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
who led the AU delegation, told
reporters afterward that African
council members would intro-
duce a resolution in the Security
Council "very soon" that would
authorize a one-year delay.
He acknowledged divisions
in the council, saying: "There
are those who support, those
who have some difficulties with
it."
But the AU hopes members
will recognize the "grave" and
"extraordinary situation" in
Kenya, which has been the target
of terrorists and is involved in
Somalia, where al-Qaida-linked
terrorist groups are active, he
said.
Agshin Mehdiyev, Azerbai-
jan's U.N. ambassador and the
current Security Council presi-
dent, called the meeting "very

interesting and very useful," but
said there was no outcome yet
because it was just an informal
discussion.
International Criminal Court
judges said Kenyatta's trial,
which had been scheduled to
start Nov. 12, will now begin Feb.
5. They expressed deep regret at
the latest delay in the long-run-
ning preparations of the case.
Hours earlier, prosecutors
said they would not oppose a
delay because they needed time
to investigate undisclosed issues
raised by Kenyatta's defense
attorneys.
The ICC charged Kenyatta
and Ruto with crimes against
humanity, including murder,
forcible population transfer and
persecution, for their alleged
roles in postelection violence
that left more than 1,000 peo-
ple dead in late 2007 and early
2008. Kenyatta also is accused
of responsibility for rape and
other inhumane acts carried out
by a criminal gang knownr as the

Mungiki, which were allegedly
under his control.
Kenyatta - who was elected
president earlier this year, even
though he had been indicted
by the ICC - insists he is inno-
cent, as does Ruto, whose trial
is already underway. Kenyatta's
lawyers have called for the case
against him to be delayed or
dropped, saying the evidence is
tainted by false testimony from
prosecution witnesses.
Pressure for a deferral has
intensified followinglast month's
deadly terror attack by militants
on a Nairobi mall, which under-
scored the country's strategic
importance in eastern Africa.
Under the Rome statute that
created the world's first perma-
nent war crimes tribunal, the
U.N. Security Council can defer a
case for a year. It has never used
that power.
Ethiopia's Ghebreyesus
stressed to reporters that a
three-month delay in Kenyatta's
trial "doesn't help."

Detroit is not in the position to take on more debt at this time
Last week, Detroit City Council rejected a $350-million loan pro-
posed by Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr. If approved by
federal Judge Steven Rhodes, who's overseeing the city's bankrupt-
cy case, the loan would provide the city with money to pay off debt, invest
in the city and fund public services. The council rejected the proposal and
won't put forth an alternative deal. The loan is being floated to help pay
off the city's $18-billion debt. Yet, the current debt owed by Detroit was
incurred from previous loans and the subsequent failure to pay them back.
Taking on more loans to pay for previous loans is simply continuing a pat-
tern that has gotten Detroit into its current financial situation.

A bout a week ago, while
walking up the steps to
my co-op, I noticed a new
presence on
our front door.
Among the
papers plas-
tered across our
door windows
advertising var-
ious communal
activities was KATIE
a particularly STEEN
loud poster:
"Luther Hal-
loween," it read
in electric green Goosebumps style.
Beneath the text was a drawing of
a ghoulish uninvited guest bursting
through a door with a bloody chain-
saw. To the left cowered a terrified
and bodacious redhead, mascara
streaming down her cheeks as she
braced for the intruder. Of course
she was only wearing a purple
thong and a size XXS camisole. Of
course she's got the body of a Vic-
toria's Secret Angel. Of course her
nipples are erect.
Something about the thong and
the cami and the nipples - they're
just so .:. unnecessary. So done-
before. And I know that's part of
the fun of the poster - it's a paro-
dy of that classic horror trope. Of
course the girl in the underwear is
goingto murderedbythe chainsaw-
wielding zombie / skeleton / vam-
pire / madman / man ina raincoat /
male figure in general. As Gretchen
Weiner, from the movie "Mean
Girls" would explain, it's, like, the
laws of horror movie anti-femi-
nism. But why?
It's no secret that horror films
traditionally don't like the ladies.
There tends to be at least one
woman who ends up anywhere
from partially to completely naked
and then sliced, hacked and other-
wise butchered. Let me diverge for
a second.
Recently, wanting to find a qual-
ity horror movie to watch, I went
on IMDb and looked up a list of
the top 100 classic horror movies.
I noticed a trend within the movie
descriptions. Antagonists include
"a practical man," "an obsessed
(male) scientist," "a (male) doctor,"
"a young man," "a brilliant (male)
surgeon," some more doctors and
young men. Victims include "the
virtuous young Mina," a "beautiful
woman," "a (female) secretary," a

bride, "nice young women," - just,
you know, "women ... " many of
whom are displayed on the front
covers in skin-tight ensembles
show off their conveniently sized
DD boobs.
So, basically, what we have here
is hot women beingkilled by men.
Yes, occasionally females are the
"bad guys" - wow, masculinity is
even in the name. There's Stephen
King's Carrie, the shy girl who you
can't help but sympathize with
even though she kills everyone and
her mother. There's the possessed
girl with the green puke in "The
Exorcist." There's the girl with the
hair in her face from "The Ring."
There's the woman with the hair
in her face from "The Grudge."
Those are a few examples that
immediately come to mind, but I
think it's notable that the common
factor with these female terrors is
that they're all somehow inhuman
- essentially "crazy" or possessed
by something else. These female
antagonists aren't completely in
control of their actions, but rather
have been corrupted by something
bigger than
themselves.
Granted, the "Cabin
films I cited
earlier are clas- Woods" c
sics, so these
movies weren't tradition
exactly created
during the peak roles in ho
of feminism.
But, really, not
too much has changed since then.
Women continue to be - the vic-
tims - de-robed and sliced up on
screens across the world. The thing
is, I really like scary movies, but
part of liking horror is having to
willfully ignore blatantly misogy-
nistic themes a lot of the time.
Until now.
Now being yesterday. I watched
"The Cabin in the Woods" for the
first time. I know, I'm a little late
in the game. I'd been told countless
times to watch it by my friends. But,
sitting at the dining room table a
few days ago, a friend of mine sug-
gested that I watch "The Cabin in
the Woods."
"It's sort of feminist," she said.
"But they still show boobs. They
just had to show boobs."
Yeah, they do show boobs in
"Cabin in the Woods." Of course
they're the boobs of a blonde - "the

Orr put out inquiries for loans to about 50
financial institutions, with four committing
loans to the city. To secure these loans, Orr
pledged income and casino tax revenue as
well as $10 million in proceeds from the sale of
city assets. The loan, from the London-based
bank Barclays, is broken down into two por-
tions: $230 million going towards the pay-
ment of previous loan debt and $120 million
going towards the funding of city services and
investment in the city.
There are many concerns about this loan. It
has a floating interest rate, meaning that the
rate could potentially rise based on market
forces, further deepening the city's debt. Orr
has pledged revenue from the sale of city assets
to secufe the loan. He has not said, however,
what would be sold to acquire the $10 million.
The sale of city property - possibly Belle Isle
or works of art from the Detroit Institute of Art
- is a point of contention for many Detroit resi-
dents who are patrons of these establishments.
This loan is being secured and promoted
during the city's bankruptcy trial. Orr, who
is also a bankruptcy lawyer, is the main force
behind the loan and is also the main promoter
of the city's filing for bankruptcy. Orr is pro-
moting both further loans as well as bank-
ruptcy for the city as ways to save money and
restructure Detroit's finances. This appears to
be a conflicting attempt to tackle the issue from
two different angles: One of the main reasons
for the current fiscal crisis is debt from previ-
ous loans. In 2005, Detroit took out a $1.44-bil-
lion loan - also based on fluctuating interest
rates - to finance its two pension funds, which
backfired and left the city even more in debt

and still trying to pay off the pensions to this
day. Filing for bankruptcy is a safe route for the
city - no more debt can be incurred while.the
legal system helps the city responsibly liquidate
its assets and pay off its debts. The city made
the decision to file for bankruptcy, and it should
attempt to utilize that route before putting into
action other plans for rescuing the city from
financial ruin.
Although Detroit's city council rejected the
loan, the proposal is now to be decided by Ste-
ven Rhodes. The decision is being deferred to
the judge because the city council chose not
to propose an alternative option. Under the
emergency manager law, city councils are only
offered 17 days to consider such a proposal by
an emergency manager. While Orr's office
had ample time to compile and present the
loan from Barclays, the city council is given an
extremely short time span to come up with a
counterproposal with "the same level of benefit
to the city." This is not nearly enough time to
create a counterproposal, especially one to pay
off millions of dollars of debt.
This loan is a continuation of the actions that
got the city of Detroit into the dire fiscal straits
in which it currently finds itself. Taking on
more loans to pay for previously incurred debt
will justcontinue the downwardspiral, one that
could potentially put up the prized possessions
of Detroit - the DIA, Belle Isle - as collateral.
Under the direction of Orr, the city is already
attempting to deal with its financial crisis by
filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Detroit should
continue down that path, and only upon failure
should it attempt to find alternative ways of
dealing with its debt.

whore"- and, of course, the boobs
are exposed when she's engaging in
some form of sexual pleasure, right
before being attacked by a zombie
redneck torture family.
But that's the whole point. While
waiting for the quintessential
blonde to show some tits, one of the
technicians in the film even says,
"OK, baby, let's see some boobies
... Gotta keep the customers satis-
fied." He watches the boobs/zombie
attack scene with close attention
- partly, because he wants to see
boobs, but also because that's what
people expect when they see a cute
young woman ina horror movie.
"Cabin in the Woods" challeng-
es the traditional role of females
in horror movies in that it follows
the traditional tropes to an almost
absurd degree. The "whore" is
pumped with pheromones until
she's a horny, ass-shaking vixen
who makes out with a taxider-
mied wolf - it was a dare, but still,
she appears to really enjoy it. The
"virgin" is naive and clueless, con-
stantly in need of male guidance
and consolation. Even the female
killers in the
movie are pretty
in the useless - there's
the "Grudge"-
hallenges like ghost girl
who's defeated
al female by a classroom
full of ador-
rror films. able Japanese
schoolchildren,
for instance,
and then there's the girl zombie,
who's overall pretty unintimidat-
ing and useless - except for when
she actually helps the protagonists
of the film.
I get that alot of scary movies are
meant to be fun - that not every
portrayal of women is going to be
realistic, just like Freddy Krueger
and Count Dracula aren't the most
realistic men. But "Cabin in the
Woods" does a damn good job at
showing how hackneyed - and
comical - these female characters
are. If you're looking for a solid hor-
ror film to cap off the Halloween
season, perhaps consider "Cabin
in the Woods." But no matter what
film you decide on, keep a critical
eye on the women in the movie -
and not just on their tits.

As the host, and author of the
event "Hood Ratchet Thursday," I
would like make a formal response
to Erin Fischer's viewpoint.
First, I would like to sincerely
apologize for any negative emo-
tions that you and any other offend-
ed members of the community may
have felt. Let me be the first to admit
that the party's theme and the lan-
guage used in the event description
were insensitive and distasteful.
Please allow me to clarify my moti-
vations behind this, because it was
never my intention to purposefully
offend or degrade another culture
or gender.
"Hood Ratchet Thursday"
started out as an idea for a party
centered around hip-hop music
- a genre that I've grown up with
and still love. As with all music,
it's nearly impossible to separate
from its culture, and hip hop has a
particularly prolific one that per-
vades mainstream consciousness.
At most college social events, the
music of choice, if not electronic
dance. music (EDM) or pop, is hip
hop.. Thus, hearing, and rapping
along to, the lyrics of A$AP Rocky's
"Fuckin' Problems" or Juicy J's
"Bandz A Make Her Dance" - the
songs from which I derived the
phrases "bad bitches" and "ratchet
pussy" respectively - or other vul-
gar songs on any given night while
out with friends is not unheard of, if
not commonplace.
Mainstream hip hop is now dom-

inated by rappers who glorify sex-
ist and superficial themes. These
are the artists whom the media
promotes and whose music we all
consume at social events and at our
own leisure. As an avid consumer
of the music, it's easy to get caught
up in the lyrics and attitude. Herein
lies the first mistake I made: trying
to emulate the culture and attitudes
prevalent in the music.
Of course, I'm aware of hip-
hop's roots in African-American
culture, and I understand why so
many are upset at my usage of the
words "ratchet," "twerking," etc.
But let me be clear: in no way was
it my intention to appropriate Black
culture. I was attempting to emu-
late the distasteful party culture of
hip hop, not as a synonym for Black
culture, but rather as the musical
genre that is consumed by all races.
Because, at least in my opinion,
when hip-hop culture reaches the
level of appeal which it enjoys with
listeners of all races and differ-
ent cultural backgrounds, it tran-
scends strictly racial definitions.
And that's how we can sometimes
forget, as I did, that it's not always
OK to emulate respected hip-hop
artists; that racial sensitivity is
no small issue; and that people
can, and will, negatively perceive
Black culture because of media and
social stereotypes.
I wish that we lived in an age
where we as people could collectively
celebrate the music that we consume

without aggravating racial sensitivi-
ties. It pains me to see that "hip-hop
parties" are immediately cast under
a racial lens, even if not so intended.
Just because we celebrate and enjoy
the music and terminology used by
predominantly Black hip-hop artists,
that does not mean we are attempt-
ing to appropriate Black culture. We
take it for what it is, and that's hip
hop as music, and thus, hip-hip cul-
ture. If current hip hop is dominat-
ed by terminology like "twerking,"
"ratchet," and "swag," then that's
what its audience absorbs as hip hop:
it doesn't have to be Black. But if peo-
ple perceive it as so, then I agree that
it's completely inappropriate.
As a fellow minority, I sympa-
thize with you for the racial preju-
dice leveled against you. I could
never pretend to understand what
you face. But as someone who has
experienced firsthand how rac-
ism, whether blatant or subtle, can
affect our emotions and livelihood,
I apologize for any hurt that I've
caused in our community.
Again, I would personally like to
offer my sincere apologies to those
affected by my lapse in judgment and
would be open to joiningthe conver-
sation on how we as a community
could-find ways to educate ourselves
on controversial race issues so that
we can avoid future misunderstand-
ings, and move forward asa healthy,
unified community.

A spooky playlist

Ballet Preljocaj to
craft fresh aesthetic

Yes, I'm well aware that
Halloween was offi-
cially last night. But
really, what are holidays, besides
excuses to get even drunker than
usual? And
everyone
knows that
the hardcore
partying gets
done on the
weekend,
as we don
our last and ELLIOT
greatest ALPERN
costumes
to toast to
another Halloween successfully
celebrated.
And yet, putting together the
playlist for your classic Halloween
party is harder than it sounds.
Sure,you'd assume,justthrow
on some "Monster Mash" and
other long-time classics together,
and put iton shuffle. But when
the ghosts are dancing at zombie
pace, and the zombies are passed
out in boredom from another play
through of the "Mash,"you'll real-
ize that it's harder than it looks.
' So, with that in mind, here are a
few suggestions...
"Superstition" by Stevie
Wonder
I list this first because, to me,
it's arguably the most important
track to include. Look, I know
- it's not the kind of song that will
have everyone jumping with
ecstasy - but it serves a vital
function. "Superstition" is the
change of pace, when we're tired
of horror-themed rap and time-
less classics. The drums start
us off, drawing in those curious
about what Billboard-topper this
could be. But then that classic
guitar lick starts up, and even
the freshmen will start grooving
(if they managed to make it in,
that is).
"Monster" by Kanye West
I shouldn't have to explain too
much why "Monster" is a Hal-
loween staple. Terror-striking

rap hit? Jay-Z spitting lines
aboutgoblins and ghouls? Add
this, and don't think twice about
it. ("Black Skinhead" deserves
a mention here, with some seri-
ously ominous drums giving way
to a tense, dark beat.)
"DARE" or "All Alone" by
Gorillaz
"DARE" is the bigger hit here,
so it makes sense that this is
the Gorillaz song you want to
add. It works well enough as a k
dance track, while still build-
ing that creepy vibe as forlorn
vocals fade into the background
(and, for the record, the video
is pretty damn strange). "All
Alone" can't be ignored though
- that first guitar bait sounds
like a villain's entrance song, yet
it's fast enough to feel the beat
through the floorboards. And is
there anything scarier than truly
being all alone?
Anything from the "Moon"
side of the Bravery's The Sun
and the Moon
If you're alt-oriented, defi-
nitely go for the "Moon Version"
of the Bravery's better hits.
"Believe" adds a spooky organ
that feels like an Addams Family
rock special, and "This Is Not
the End" brings ina subtly scary
guitar line. It's as if the Brav-
ery wanted its own Halloween
album, and simply added it as a
B-side.
A remix of"Thriller" by
Michael Jackson
Everyone plays "Thriller" as
their centerpiece at Halloween
- your friends, your co-workers,
your grandma. And likewise,
everyone expects it. But puta
party veteran's twist on it -
maybe try to finda dubstep ver-
sion, or at least something with
synths that bust through during
the chorus. No more minute-
and-a-half where we awkwardly
dance to the narrator's ending
monologue, at the very least.
"Scatta" and "Scary Monsters
and Nice Sprites" by Skrillex

I mean, the latter has the
word "monster" right in the title!
I know it's a bit stale by now, but
hey, maybe it's finally old enough
to makea resurgence. If not, at
least add "Scatta" - whatever
that is in the background that
sounds like an electronic organ
gives it that tense Halloween
flavor.
"Crying Lightning" and "R
U Mine?" by the Arctic Mon-
keys; "Howlin' for You" by the
Black Keys
This is where it gets down
more to personal preference, but
as some rock filler for the playl-
ist, these three serve equally
well. The Arctic Monkeys have
mastered, among other things,
the ability to infuse a song with
some darkness. "R U Mine?" off
their latest album is definitely
the faster of the two, but if you're
looking more for an atmosphere
of midnight hijinks, "Crying
Lightning" slinks around well
enough. "Howlin' For You" is
another obvious add as a sinister
track with some pretty blatant
imagery (with the "Howlin"'
part, at least).
"Monster Mash" by Bobby
Pickett
Just kidding. Seriously, if
any party moves from Kanye to
Bobby without an apology, you
have the right - nay, the duty -
to leave immediately.
With evena few of these,
you'll have a solid core - onto
which many of you will no doubt
pile on the Miley and Katy Perry.
But whatever - I've done my
job here. And with a little luck,
maybe while I'm walking from
one party to the next, I'll hear
the notes from "Superstition"
carry on the wind. If so, maybe
I'll take the moment to dedicate
a little groove to you. And then
I'll be back on my scary way.

Mash.' To argue with him,

Artistic director
talks apocalypse,

By GILLIAN JAKAB
For the Daily
There is a space between

ers with pink

Lake" and

This space is power Center
occupied by
the genre of From $18
modern ballet,
combining the rules of classi-
cal balletic training with a con-
viction to bend and twist them
into a movement vocabulary
outside of the conventional
format. One of modern ballet's
masters, Angelin Preljocaj, the
artistic director of Ballet Prel-
jocaj, will bring his company to
the Power Center this weekend
as part of UMS's fall season.
Preljocaj was trained in clas-
sical ballet in France, and in
1980, moved to New York to
study with post-modern danc-
ers like Merce Cunningham.
Today, in addition to having his
own renowned company based
in Aix-en-Provence, Preljocaj
often receives commissions to
choreograph works for ballet

companies around the world,
including, recently, New York
City Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet
and Staatsoper Berlin.
The company will perform
"And Then, One Thousand
Years of Peace," drawn from
the biblical text of St. John's
"The Book of Revelation," and
explore apocalyptic themes
against a background of origi-
nal techno music to portray a
universal response to upheaval.
"And Then, One Thousand
Years of Peace" was originally
choreographed for the Bol-
shoi Ballet in 2010. The danc-
ers involved, and the cultures
they come from, undoubtedly
shaped Preljocaj's choreo-
graphic process.
"It was half my dancers and
half those of the Bolshoi Bal-
let," Preljocaj said, "And I
think of 'And Then, One Thou-
sand Year of Peace' (as meant)
to reflect revolution, which of
course has been a huge theme
in histories of both France and
Russia."
In 2012, Ballet Preljocaj left
a lasting impression on UMS's
audience with its performance
of "Snow White." The com-
pany's timely encore will show
us another side of Preljocaj's
work.
"'Snow White' was a more
literal telling of a story," Prel-
jocaj said. " 'And Then, One
Thousand Years of Peace' is
less of a direct commentary;
it draws on a relationship
between the text of St. Jean,
'Revelations' and the relevance
of what is happening in our
world today."
Global dialogue on the apoc-
alypse is as diverse and wide-

spread as ever. With the Mayan
calendar's prediction of the end
of the world in 2012, the loom-
ing threats of global warming
and nuclear proliferation, the
theme is a common one for peo-
ple throughout the world. Prel-
jocaj does not assert a pointed
thesis, but works to channel
this collective dialogue to pro-
voke a response.
"What's particularly power-
ful about dance as an art form
is that everyone has bodies,
and therefore everyone can feel
and connect to these physical
human responses."
Ballet Preljocaj, a true illus-
tration of modern ballet, aims
to create a fresh aesthetic
with virtuosic dancers and the
edgy music one might hear in
a nightclub. In fact, Laurent
Garnier, who created the music
for "And Then, One Thousand
Years of Peace," first worked as
a DJ in the legendary nightclub
Fac 51 Hacienda in Manchester,
and is among Europe's fore-
most techno and house music
producers.
,"I think Laurent Garnier's
electronic techno music will
talk to young people," Preljo-
caj said. "It is not typical ballet
music like Tchaikovsky."
Returning to Ann Arbor time
and time again, Ballet Preljocaj
performs works as textured
and forward thinking as the
University community audi-
ence.
"And Then, One Thousand
Years of Peace" will present
the challenge of feeling what is
conceptual - grand notions of
global dilemma and social jus-
tice - on a physical and intui-
tively human level.

Diaz owns 'The Counselor'

By SEAN CZARNECKI
DailyFilmEditor
"TheCounselor"makesnocom-
promises. Laden with musicality,
it belts out the biblical language
of Cormac
McCarthy (his A-
first screenplay)
that other adap- The
tations of his Counselor
work deemed
too demand- At Qualityl6
ing for the and Rave
screen. Here,
the screenplay 20th Century Fox
acts as both the
film's strength
and downfall. It aspires to tran-
scribe the famed author's gnomic
aesthetic to screen with as few
compromises as possible. Where
others will call "The Counselor"
pretentious, I call it bold. I call
it relentless. This is a film at its
best when steeped in eloquence
and dread, when it's like the
- whole vengeful universe is being
brought to bear on one man's fate.
The Counselor (Michael Fass-
bender, "12 Years a Slave") is in
trouble. To get out of trouble, the
specifics of which are left murky,
he finds a way to make money fast.
His associates think badly of the
proposition. They make prophetic
warnings of the danger he'd put
himself into, meddling in a busi-
ness responsible for thousands of
deaths in Mexico.
Of course, he doesn't listen. One
time deal? Not a chance.
Long renowned for his delib-
erate pacing, Ridley Scott ("Pro-
metheus") has crafted a movie
stringent in explanation. You
don't get the gentle signposts with
which most thrillers pamper you.
He piles on scenes that peek like
a voyeur into a cartel drug ship-
ment journeying from Juarez to
Chicago whereon each mile north-

Still searching for lineup

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Senior defenseman Derek DeBlois described Michigan Tech coach Mel Pearson as "a player's coach."
amiliar face returns

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan Tech may have beat-
en the Michigan hockey team in
the semifinals of the Great Lakes
Invitational last winter, but there
won't be much animosity toward
the Huskies when the two teams
meet this weekend at Yost Ice
Arena.
In fact, many of Michigan's
players and
coaches share Michigan
a special con-
nection with TchCat.

coach and was Fox Sports
an integral Detroit
part of Michi-
gan's recruit-
ing efforts. After the 1999-2000
season, in which the Wolverines
won the CCHA regular-season
championship, Pearson earned
the TerryFlanaganAward,which
recognizes a coach for his career
accomplishments. f
Senior forward Luke Moffatt
and junior forward Alex Guptill
were both recruited by Pearson,
and he was later the forwards
coach when the high-powered

Wolverines reached the NCAA
Tournament final in 2011.
"He was like a player's coach,"
said senior forward Derek DeB-
lois. "He was a guy that messed
around with you a little bit,
always had a smile on and was
always making jokes. He was fun
to have around."
Now in his 30th season, Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson was
around for the entirety of Pear-
son's tenure. And though the
former assistant will be coming
to Ann Arbor this weekend with
an opposing team, Berenson will
welcome him warmly.
."He's still a good friend,"
Berenson said, adding that the
two stay in touch.
Pearson's duties at Michi-
gan included scheduling, and
he never once organized a game
between his alma mater, Michi-
gan Tech, and the Wolverines.
The two schools have faced each
other more than 200 times -
with Michigan holding a 120-91-
4 series lead - but haven't met at
either school's home arena since
1984, playing almost solely at the
GLI.
"I'm sure they'll be excited to
play here," Berenson said.
Still, there have been plenty of
memorable matchups between
the two rivals. In 2007, Michigan
survived the Huskies in double
overtime to win the GLI, the
fourth time that the Wolverines
clinched the championship over
Michigan Tech. But the Huskies
had the last laugh when they met
in Detroit last year. Goaltender
Pheonix Copley stopped all 38 of

the Wolverines' shots for a shut-
out, and he thenblanked Western
Michigan the following night to
earn the Most Valuable Player
award and give his team the title.
Copley is still around, and it
might be just as hard to put a
puck past him. He was recently
crowned WCHA Defensive Play-
er of the Week, ranks second in
his conference in goals-against
average and comes in at seventh
nationally in save percentage.
That could pose an issue for
the Wolverines. Disregarding
a seven-goal outburst against
Rochester Institute of Technol-
ogy, Michigan is averaging just
two goals per contest.
But by far the biggest battle
of the weekend could be on spe-
cial teams. The Wolverines rank
fourth in the nation with the man
advantage, converting on 30.4
percent of their opportunities.
Meanwhile, Michigan Tech has
had to kill off 33 penalties - more
than any other team in the nation
- but does so at a solid 83.7 per-
cent, good for 21st in the NCAA.
The Huskies have also scored two
short-handed goals.
With Pearson at the helm of
Michigan Tech, the Huskies have
compiled the second-best two-
year stretch in school history.
And as Michigan experienced
harshly last season, a history of
success over their rivals from the
Upper Peninsula matters little
when the puck drops.
"Every game in college hockey,
as we learned last year, is a diffi-
cult one," DeBlois said.

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Writer
ROSEMONT, Ill. - In a college
basketball game, there are 200
available minutes to be played.
This year, the Michigan women's
basketball team enters the season
returning just 44.2 of those min-
utes from last year.
At Big Ten Media Day on Thurs-
day, Michigan
coach Kim NOTEBOOK
Barnes Arico
readily admitted that this year
will likely have many bumps in
the road for the Wolverines, echo-
ing the same sentiments as from
Michigan's media day last week.
"It's going to be a bit of a tran-
sition year for us," Barnes Arico
said. "We have a lot of inexperi-
ence, we have a lot of youth, but
we're really excited about the
opportunity to get on the court."
She doesn't know who will fill
all of the minutes in question,
and she doesn't expect to know
any time soon. Barnes Arico said
returning starting guard Nicole
Elmblad, freshman guard Siera
Thompson and junior forward
Cyeesha Goree have earned start-
ing spots, and junior guard Shan-
non Smith also likely has a spot.
The last starting spot and the
remaining minutes are up in the
air, and Barnes Arico expects the
battles to be in the rotation to last
well into the season and to include
almost every healthy body on the
roster.
"It's good to have the kids
unsure of who has the start-
ing role because then practices
become a little more competitive,
and everybody is fighting for the
opportunity to get on the court,"

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico
said eneryone has a chance to start.
Barnes Arico said.
Even among her presumed
starters, Barnes Arico acknowl-
edged the lack of prior playing
time will be a factor. For example,
Goree has played only 33 min-
utes over the first two years of
her career, and Barnes Arico has
said she may play more than 33
minutes in some single games this
season.
STIFF EXHIBITION COMPETI-
TION AHEAD: Barnes Arico's first
opportunity to tinker with her
rotation will be Friday night in an
exhibition against Wayne State.
Though just an exhibition, Barnes
Arico views the game as a valuable
opportunity to see how her inex-
perienced players will perform in
game situations.
"It'll be interesting to see who
responds and who steps up when
the lights go on," Barnes Arico
said.
The Warriors aren't your typi-
cal Division II opponent, as they
will be sending out three Divi-
sion I transfers in the exhibi-
tion. Wayne State center Shareta

Brown was the University of
Detroit's leading scorer last sea-
son and averaged 21 points per
game, including a 19-point perfor-
mance against a more experienced
Michigan squad last November.
No matter the- competition,
Barnes Arico expects the team's
early season games to be a learn-
ing experience for her players
while she works toward determin-
ing individual roles for each play-
er. Last year, the process was very
different with the team's experi-
enced seniors clearly ahead of the
young, inexperienced players.
"Now, everybody's kind of on
the same level," Barnes Arico said.
"So it will give an opportunity, if a
kid's not playing well, hey, let's try
a new kid. This kid's not playing
well, let's try a new kid."
MORE INJURY WOES: For the
past two seasons, the Wolverines
have not caught many breaks
when it comes to injuries. Last
season, five Michigan players tore
their anterior cruciate ligaments,
causing them to miss the entire
season..
The prognosis looked brighter
heading into this season, before
sophomore guard Kelsey Mitch- 0
ell broke her foot early in the fall
after suffering an ACL tear last
season. Then, freshman guard
Danielle Williams broke a finger
on her left hand last week. Wil-
liams is expected to miss about a
month, after undergoing surgery
last Thursday.
"It is unfortunate that this hap-
pened to Danielle so close to the
beginning of the season," Barnes
Arico said in astatement."She was
expected to play a major role on
this team, and losing her greatly
impacts us moving forward."

DO YOU HAVE ADD or ADHD?

A TIME: Getting through college
with ADHD. A first-hand, insightful

advantage through the third
round of the NCAA Tournament.
But it must do so against Ohio
State, on the Wolverines' emo-
tional senior night, for their first
win over the Buckeyes since 2008.
And that still might not be
enough to give the Wolverines
their first-ever regular-season Big
Ten championship.
No. 8 Michigan (8-1-1 Big Ten,
14-2-1 overall) enters Saturday's
showdown with the Buckeyes
(4-4-2, 10-5-3) riding a seven-
game winning streak that dates
back to Sept. 29, but first-place
Nebraska has matched the Wol-
verines win for win - including
a double-overtime upset of Penn
State on Sunday.
Even Michigan's 2-1 victory at
Nebraska (9-1, 14-3-1) on Oct. 6
wasn'tenough to springboard the
Wolverines in the Big Ten stand-
ings.
"It's especially frustrating
because, head-to-head, we beat
Nebraska," said senior defender
Kayla Mannino. "But regardless
of how Nebraska does on Friday,
I'm still going to be proud of this
team and the season we've had."
Now, Michigan has just one
more chance for a Nebraska loss:
Indiana (6-4-0,13-4-1) in Lincoln.
The catch is that the game is Fri-
day, which means the Wolverines
are split between not wanting to
find out the score and being the
biggest Indiana soccer fans in the
country.
"I'll look, I think," said senior
defender Holly Hein with a smile.
"I'll want to know."
Added Mannino: "It's kind of a
split amongst our team. I person-
ally am not going to watch it. I
don't want to know about it."
If Indiana's upset bid does fall
short, Michigan still has plenty to
play for the next day. The seniors
have never beaten Ohio State, and
the rivalry will always be there.
"We're happy to have one of
the best finishes - regardless of
what happens this weekend - in
Michigan soccer history," Hein

said. "We'd be even (happier) if
it goes our way this weekend, but
we'll see."
On top of it all, Michigan is
playing for home-field advantage
in the NCAA Tournament. The
top 32 teams play one home game,
and the top eight play three. This
week, Michigan sits right on the
edge in eighth but will have to
wait out the selection show after
the Big Ten Tournament.
The last time the two ,rivals
met, Ohio State ousted Michigan
from the Big Ten Tournament
Ryan said the game should be
like most others the Wolverines.
have played, a physical Big Ten
battle. His team practiced playing
that style all week.
Hein said one of the team's
goals this week has been to start
faster. The Wolverines haven't
scored in the first 23 minutes of
the game since Oct. 3 at Michigan
State.
Michigan has, however, bal-
anced out its scoring in recent
games. Seven different players
have tallied its last eight goals.
Hein said starting fastwouldn't
be a problem despite the emotion
before the game., The seniors will
be honored before the game with
their parents. Hein, who is from
Castaic, Calif., is playing in front
of her whole family for the first
time since high school.
"To be honest, I've been trying
not to think about it too much,"
Mannino said. "Emotionally, I
don't know how I'm going to feel
about it until Saturday, when I
step on the field. I still haven't
really accepted it."
Still, Ryan and the players
refuse to acknowledge the stakes,
focusing only on their matchup
with the Buckeyes.
"It's not tough for me, and
I don't think it's tough for the
players," Ryan -said. "If we get
help from Indiana, great. If not,
we still finished better than any
Michigan team in the history of
the program."

Redshirt junior linebacker Jake Ryan should play expanded minutes Saturday, in what will likely be another physical battle with Michigan State in East Lansing.
An in- state rivalry re es
this tiewt ihrsae

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
was asked this week to compare
the Michigan State rivalry to the
one with Ohio State. This game,
especially in East Lansing,
always feels like a playground
fight.
This time, when the No. 23
Michigan football team meets
No. 24 Michigan State on Sat-
urday, the field will be muddy,
the forecasts say. Windy again.
Last time the game was in East
Lansing, trash. swirled around
Spartan Stadium as if this game
wasn't being held in a stadium at
all, but in a dirty lot anywhere
in the state,
in Detroit or Michigan
Farmington Michign
Hills or Grand
Rapids, and State
two teams met Matchup
here to fight Michigan 6-1;
and settle old MSU 7-1
scores.
Hoke didn't 3n atur-
take the bait.
"I think Where: Spar-
they're both tan Stadium
important," he TV:
said. ABC
But this one
has gotten more and more so
since Mark, Dantonio became
Michigan State's coach in 2006.
Michigan hates the Buckeyes.
But at least it respects them.
For this game, the rhetoric has
become familiar.
"We labeled them as a little
brother," said fifth-year senior
running back Fitzgerald Tous-
saint on Tuesday. "And, you
know the little brother always
want to prove themselves and
try to beat up the big brother
one day. I think they really take
offense to that."

This game, always, is brutish
and ugly, and it's that brutish
ugliness that makes it beautiful.
This year, the stakes are higher.
The game will be as close to a
divisional championship game
as it gets at the start of Novem-
ber. Michigan is 2-1 in the con-
ference, with a tough month
ahead. Michigan State is 4-0
with few tests remaining. For
Michigan, a win means it con-
trols its own Legends Division
destiny. A loss all but hands the
Spartans the division.
For Michigan State (4-0 Big
Ten, 7-1 overall), not much has
changed. Offensively, Michigan
State relies heavily on the ground
game. Its passing game has been
inconsistent. Michigan's defense
has been vulnerable to the big
play, but the Spartans hardly
generate any. They rank second-
to-last nationally in plays of 40
yards or more.
Defensively, the Spartans are
dominant. Its defense is ranked
first nationally in total defense
and rushing defense. It is ranked
third in passing defense and-
scoring defense. On both sides of
the ball, the strategy is no secret:
win the running game.
"There's not a lot of gim-
micks," said Michigan defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison.
"And I love that."
When opposing teams have
had success against the Spar-
tans, it has been through the air.
Cornerback Darqueze Dennard
is one of the conference's best,
but so is Michigan's fifth-year
receiver Jeremy Gallon. Last
time Gallon played, he set the
Big Ten record with 369 receiv-
ing yards.
The Spartans' cornerbacks
are especially physical, but
Michigan (2-1, 6-1) is well-suited
for that. The 5-foot-8 Gallon is

Needing a win against a bitter
rival on the road to keep control of
its Big Ten title hopes isn't exactly
an ideal position for the Michigan
football team. But that's where the
Wolverines stand entering Satur-
day's showdown with Michigan
State.
The Spartans clearly have the
advantage on defense, while the
Michigan offense is by far the bet-
ter of the two. So where will this
game be won or lost? Probably in
the trenches.
Michigan pass offense vs. Michi-
gan State pass defense
Chances are, the record-setting
offensive display against Indiana
two weeks ago willifeel like a thing
ofthe past once the Hoosiers'slop-
py pass coverage is replaced bythe
Spartan secondary, led by Dar-
queze Dennard. Michigan coach
Brady Hoke called Dennard, who
has a pair of interceptions this
season, a "high-round pick," and
redshirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner will need to take extra.
care when throwing in his direc-
tion.
Gardner surely won't be throw-
ing for 503 yards this week as he
did against Indiana.He would be
extremely fortunate to escape the
Big Ten-leading Michigan State
defense without a turnover.
Sophomore tight end A.J. Wil-
liams's one-game suspension
shouldn't cause too much damage
to Michigan's aerial attack. Sopho-
more Devin Funchess will still get
his reps on the outside, and fifth-
year senior wide receiver Jeremy
Gallon is coming off the best sin-
gle-game receiving performance
in the history of the Big Ten.
But again, this isn't the Hoo-
siers, and the Wolverines won't
move the ball with anywhere near
as much ease.
Edge: Michigan State
Michigan rush offense vs. Michi-
gan State rush defense
This is where the Spartans are
at their best. Teams simply do not
run the football on them. They
haven't allowed a 100-yard rusher
all season. And fifth-year senior
running back Fitzgerald Tous-
saint probably didn't do himself
any favors by referring to Michi-
gan State as "little brother" earlier
this week.
Freshman guard Kyle Bosch
will be making his first-ever start
Saturday as Hoke continues to try
to piece together the best offen-
sive line possible. He may have
finally found the right combina-
tion, but against the Spartans, it
could easily be moot.
Expect almost all of the carries
to go to Toussaint as the coaching
stafftries to prevent any turnovers
from Derrick Green, who might be
prone to them in his first battle for
the Paul Bunyan Trophy.
Edge: Michigan State

Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison has said there are still
passes that Michigan defensive
backs should be picking off but
have not. With that said, the sec-
ondary has shown it can force
turnovers in key spots, with fifth-
year senior safety Thomas Gordon
sealing the Indiana game with
two late picks.
But Connor Cook, the start-
ing Spartan quarterback, doesn't
make many mistakes. He has
thrown just two interceptions,
compared to 12 touchdowns, this
season in eventually winning
the top spot on the depth chart.
Last week, he completed 15 of his
16 pass attempts, though it was
against lowly Illinois.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan State rush offense vs.
Michigan rush defense
Most of Michigan's efforts will
be focused on stopping the run,
and rightfully so. Spartan tailback
Jeremy Langford has nine rushing
touchdowns this season and has
racked up 655 yards.
The Michigan State offensive
line is much improved from the
early weeks when the Spartans
failed to move the ball with any
consistency. Michigan State coach
Mark Dantonio will run the foot-
ball early and often, trying to wear
down the Wolverines' defense.
The Spartan offense may not
have many explosive playmakers,
but it has shown it can grind teams
down, and Michigan is in trouble
if that happens Saturday.
Edge: Michigan State
Special teams
Mike Sadler is almost enough to
singlehandedly give this category
to the Spartans. Not only is he an
outstanding punter, but earlier
this season against Iowa, he car-
ried the ball for 25 yards on a fake.
Meanwhile, the Wolverines have
had problems punting the ball.
Michigan State relies on fresh-
man Michael Geiger to handle its
kicking duties, and he's 6-for-7 on
the year.
Edge: Michigan State
Intangibles
The Spartans can sense that
they are on the verge of a berth in
the Big Ten title game, with the
schedule shaping up favorably the
rest of the way.
With 27 players back from the
Michigan team that was beat up
in East Lansing in 2011, the Wol-
verines should be prepared for
the physical game that lies ahead.
That means no excuses if they are
again bullied at Spartan Stadium.
Edge: Michigan
Prediction: Michigan State 20,
Michigan10

Fifth-year senior runningback Fitzgerald Toussaint averages 3.7 yards per rush.

often pressed, with little suc-
cess. Sophomore Devin Funch-
ess is a converted tight end,
where he grew accustomed
to bigger defenders. Redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner has flourished since Funch-
ess moved to receiver, but he
is also turnover-prone, and
the Spartans secondary has
returned four interceptions for
touchdowns this year.
But the game is usually decid-
ed on the ground, and team that
has won the rushing battle has
won the game in 40 of the past
43 meetings. Michigan State
defensive coordinator Pat Nar-
duzzi has terrorized Michigan
in the past with A-gap blitzes to
generate pressure up the middle.
The Wolverines enter Saturday
with major question marks on
the interior of the offensive line,
where they have yet to find a
successful combination of block-
ers. Fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint aver-
ages just 3.7 yards per carry this
year. Michigan State's defense
averages just two. Michigan's
offense is weakest where Michi-
gan State is best.
Like most things in this
rivalry, the Wolverines take
Michigan State's physical

supremacy personally. Michi-
gan won in 2012, but it was a
defensive struggle. In 2011, the
Spartans dominated the line of
scrimmage. They pulled Denard
Robinson's facemask after the
whistle. Fifth-year senior left
tackle Taylor Lewan said it felt
like Michigan was bullied.
"If somebody came up to you
and hit you right in the face,
would you take it personally?"
he said. "Yeah, I take it person-
ally."
His fellow fifth-year senior
right tackle, Michael Schofield,
said the seniors talk about that
game constantly.
"We don't want to forget
that," he said.
Schofield said the veterans
have tried to prepare the fresh-
men for the intensity of the
rivalry. But Hoke said it's impos-
sible to understand the game
until you play in it.
But, at the very least, even the
young players know what's at
stake. When Mattison stepped to
the podium for his weekly press
conference Tuesday, he didn't
waste words on what everyone
already knew.
"Michigan State week," he
said. "Here we go."

With lots of film, and a Final Four run, a folk hero is born

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
ROSEMONT, Ill. - They can't
all be Mitch Mcdary.
There are the guys that have
been recruited since they were
underclassmen in high school,
with others not being noticed
until senior year, and in Spike
Albrecht's case, not until senior
year was almost over.
It wasn't until the spring
recruiting period of his senior
year that Albrecht was recog-
nized, pursued and finally signed
by Michigan. His alternative plans
were to play in the mountains of
North Carolina for Appalachian
State. Rather than the National
Championship, he would have
been playing to finish above .500
in the Southern Conference.
"It was probably the shortest
time period of an evaluation with
the most in-depth evaluation,"
said Michigan coach John Beilein
at Big Ten Media Day about
the time from when he noticed
Albrecht, to when Albrecht com-

mitted in early April 2012.
The move on the 5-foot-11 point
guard from Crown Point, Ind. may
very well have been spurredby the
possibility of Trey Burke leaving
for the NBA after his freshman
year.
Beilein asked for five high-
schooltapes ofAlbrecht's games at
Crown Point High School, as well
as three or four prep-school tapes
from Northfield Mount Hermon
in Massachusetts. He then had
his staff edit the tapes into 300 to
400 cuts of every possession that
Albrecht had the ball.
In the heart of the Big Ten sea-
son as Michigan worked its way
toward its first conference cham-
pionship since 1986, Beilein would
watch Albrecht's edits while trav-
eling. He'd watch those same cuts
over and over again.
"I see him score 30 points in
a high-school game and then 30
more the next game," Beilein
said. "But then I'd see him not
even shoot it in prep school, then
become the MVP."
Beilein was referring to

Beilein has often likened to an
"altar boy" wasn't a tough deci-
sion.
"This one, it wasn't as hard as
you think for me," Beilein said.
"Because I knew what I was look-
ing for. A kid that embraced aca-
demics, that wanted to be part of
a Big Ten team and also was not
going to be going pro. He had no
illusions of leaving to go pro early."
Beilein's success in recruiting
Albrecht was no aberration. The
blueprint for pulling in the unher-
alded recruit and turninghim into
a glory boy had been long estab-
lished. Beilein reeled in just one
top-100 player in his time at West
Virginia, and converted lightly
recruited nobodies like Kevin
Pittsnogle and Joe Alexander into
household names. Alexander, who
became the eighth overall pick in
the 2008 NBA Draft, averaged just
two points a game in prep school,
according to Beilein.
Albrecht's ceiling likely won't
reach shouting distance of the
NBA, but there's plenty else going
his way.

"He just wanted to come in and
be a great teammate on this team,
no matter what his role was,"
Beilein said. "It worked out pretty
good for him."
Beilein expected Albrecht to
come in and play five to 10 minutes
a game, not to take on folk-hero
status after a 17-point outburst
against Louisville in the National
Championship. Albrecht nailed
3-pointer after 3-pointer, crafted
nifty drives to the basket and kept
the Wolverines competitive while
Burke sat on the bench in foul
trouble in the first half.
"There was a moment in the
Louisville game where he was
on his run. One of our walk-ons
who guarded him every day, Eso
Akunne, was sitting there. And
he couldn't gather himself, what
he was watching," Beilein said
as he clutched his face, mimick-
ing the former Wolverine guard,
turning his head to the side. "He
was just shaking his head saying,
'I can't believe what I am seeing
right now.' Those are the great
moments in coaching."

Sophomore guard Spike Albrecht wasn't recruited by Michigan until the 11th hour.

DUELING COLUMNS
In the week leading up to the Michigan-Michigan State football game each year, football
writers from the Daily and the student newspaper at Michigan State exchange columns.
As the teams prepare to clash in East Lansing, here's this year's installment:

The Michigan Daily's Everett Cook:

The. State News's Stephen Brooks:

ne of my earliest inter-.
actions with Michigan
State started with a
female Spartan screaming at me
to suck a part ofther body that she
categorically cannot possess.
This was during my sophomore
year two years
ago during the
"touch" foot-
ball game that
The Michigan
Daily and The
State News
play every Fri-
day before the EVERETT
real football COOK
players battle
on Saturday. I
grew up in California not know-
ing a thing about Michigan State
or why there is such animosity
(for Michigan State fans reading
this, that means "bad blood")
between these two schools.
I'm not like alot of my class-
mates, the ones that grew up with
or knowing Spartan fans, or the
ones who applied to both schools,
just in case they don't get into
Michigan. Everything I know
about Michigan State comes from
personal experience - there were
no preconceived ideas or stereo-*
types that come with growing up
in this area.
So, my relationship with Michi-
gan State started on that field
with that foul-mouthed Spartan,
who I later found out was the
editor-in-chief of that esteemed
publication.
Two years later, not much has
changed. The State News scored
only one touchdown in lastyear's
game for its eighth (yes, eighth)
loss ina row, there were several
verbal grenades thrown toward
our sideline that would have made
even the crudest Spartan cringe

and I still don't know a ton about
Michigan State.
For out-of-state students that
don't have family members or
anyone from the bottom half of
their high school head to East
Lansing, this intra-state tension
feels a lot different.
Still, over the course of an
undergraduate career, Wolverines
meet Spartans, usually through
mutual friends. It happens. Truly,
they are not all bad people.
But when the topic of school
comes up - what's your major,
etc. - ifa Spartan got into Michi-
gan, they will let you know.
It's never, "Yeah, I'm studying
to be a veterinarian and I really
like the program." It's always,
"Yeah, I got into Michigan but
decided to go to State becausse the
program was a better fit for me."
It doesn't matter that Michi-
gan State has a very respectable
veterinarian program - if that
Spartan got into Michigan, you'll
know very soon.
For an out-of-state student, this
inferiority complex doesn't make
any sense. Michigan State is a fine
school with decent athletic teams.
Its football team has won four of
the last five meetingsbetween the
two schools - obviously impres-
sive. The all-time record of 68-32-
5 in Michigan's favor changes that
perception a bit, but hey, four of
the last five!
Even if you had never heard
of this "little brother complex"
before - which a good chunk of
out-of-state students haven't - it
became painfully evident during
the touch football game. The best
part about the editor-in-chief
screaming that anatomically
incorrect barb? It was after she
had picked upa first down.
Instead of being happy after a

nice play, the insult was hurled
out of pure anger. Anyone who
thinks that inferiority complex
doesn't exist is delusional.
The game on Saturday - which
will likely decide the division
winner - is going to be close. It
may not be pretty, because Michi-
gan State has a dominant defense
while Michigan has an exciting
offense that has a tendency to
turn the ball over. Also, the fin-
est intramural quarterbacks in
East Lansing probably could have
equaled whatever Connor Cook
and Andrew Maxwell are doing
this season, but that's beside the
point.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
has historically struggled on the
road during his tenure in Ann
Arbor, while Michigan State
coach Mark Dantonio has tradi-
tionally done very well against
Michigan. It's going to be a dog-
fight.
And yet, the real game on Fri-
day, where the Daily goes for nine
in a row, will be even better.
ButI can guarantee that
nobody wearing maize will be
telling anybody to suck anything
- just not how we operate. Maybe
that's an entitled thing to say, but
I would ratherbe entitled than
ignorant.
That's not coming from some-
one who has been told that his
whole life - that's coming from
someone who has had the plea-
sure to witness it himself, up close
and personal, over the last four
years.
Little brother, and the scream-
ing editor-in-chief, brought it
upon themselves.

et's begin with a stroll
down memory lane.
That's not too much
to ask for a university and fan-
base obsessed with the past,
right? In fact, many of you
never left.

I under-
stand most
of you have
simply gone
along with
the elitist,
holier-than-
thou rhetoric
you've heard
from Michi-
gan fans and

STEPHEN
BROOKS

supporters
all your life. The sense of supe-
riority and arrogance has been
passed along for generations.
For those of you that picked it
up from a real alumni instead
of in the Wal-Mart clearance
section, good for you! That's a
rare feat.
Slide those blue and yellow
tinted glasses off and take a
look at the real world, where
quarterbacks don't wear No.
98 and people don't act like
they reinvented the wheel for
playing night games. Like the
females in Ann Arbor, the past
isn't as glamorous when you
take a longer look.
The almighty Wolverines
claim 11 national titles in their
100-plus year history. The
NCAA recognizes nine of them
- and only four are claimed
solely by U-M.
The early championships
date all the way back to the
fiercely competitive days of
the early 1900s when only a
fraction of schools competed
and the Ford Model T still was
years away from hitting the

market.
From 1901-04, the Wolver-
ines ripped off four consecutive
national titles before the for-
ward pass was even legal. It's
too bad none of us were around
for some of those classic games
against Physicians & Surgeons,
American Medical or Drake
back in 1904.I bet those were
great.
Since the Associated Press
began crowning national cham-
pions in 1936, the Wolverines
are credited with just one
outright (1948) and one split
national championship (1997).
That doesn't scream "leaders
and best" to me, but hey I'm
just an uneducated Sparty,
right?
That's the root of this rivalry
hatred: perception.
MSU supporters take issue
with the disconnect between
perception and reality with
U-M people. We grow tired of
Wolverines living in the past
and the superiority complex
that comes with it.
Call us little brother, it's true.
I don't have to do the math
for you studious folks to tell
you U-M is older than MSU.
Michael Jordan, Barack Obama,
Peyton Manning - they're all
little brothers. They turned out
OK.
For a school that loves brag-
ging about education, will
somebody tell Brady Hoke the
Buckeyes hail from Ohio State?
The Ohio Bobcats aren't on the
schedule -- probably for the
best considering how tough
MAC foe Akron was.
U-M is afraid to admit it's
threatened by MSU. It always
has been, going back to when it
attempted to block MSU from

joining the Big Ten. Now, the
Spartans are on the rise with
a clear foundation and knack
for winning the Paul Bunyan
Trophy.
I can see how it's so easy to
cling to the past when the pres-
ent offers such little hope.
You embarrassingly chased
away a top-notch coach likea
new kid on the elementary play-
ground because he was differ-
ent and didn't conform to "the
Michigan way." Then you tried
to praise the hiring of a third-
string candidate who's still
using Rodriguez's players and
only recently stopped using his
playbook. U-M continues to get
pummeled by Ohio State annu-
ally and shows no signs of beat-
ing MSU on a consistent basis.
The faux aura around the
U-M football program is as big
a sham as a newspaper staffed
by kids that don't even major in
journalism.
Like it or not, these programs
see eye-to-eye now. Big brother
has grown old and decrepit, a
has-been that's all but faded
into the shadows of a once-
glorious past. Little brother is
youthful and energetic, his best
years yet to come.
Four wins in five years,
favored to be five of six by the
end of the weekend. The pres-
sure on U-M is evident, from
the faculty-endorsed skywrit-
ing to Fitz Toussaint's false
sense of bravado. It desperately
yearns to return to an era none
of us were alive to see.
For the Spartans, where's the
threat?
