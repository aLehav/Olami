UMPD: No threat
to public safety,
no injuries found
during autopsy
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editor
University Police are investi-
gating the death of a freshman
student who was found deceased
in his Baits II Residence Hall
dorm room last night.
UMPD identified the stu-
dent as Music, Theatre & Dance
freshman Thibault deSaint-
Phalle, an 18-year-old male from
California.
At about 12 a.m. Monday, a
well-being check was requested

for deSaintPhalle, who Uni-
versity Police say had not been
seen by friends all weekend.
When Housing Security offi-
cers entered the student's dorm
room, they found the 18-year-old
deceased in his bed.
University Police say there is
currently no indication that the
death represents a public safety
threat, but is being investigated
nonetheless.
The Washtenaw County Med-
ical Examiner conducted an
autopsy on deSaintPhalle this
afternoon and found no injuries.
The toxicology results of the
autopsy are still pending, and
the process could take several
weeks.
Police declined to comment
on the person who requested the
well-being check.

SENATE ASSEMBLY
Faculty body
discusses IT
consolidation

Members express
concern regarding
effects of cutbacks
BySTEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
Despite a modest turn out,
there was no shortage of con-
versation at the Senate Assem-
bly's monthly meeting, which
was held at Palmer Commons
Monday night.
Following a quick approval
of previous minutes and the
agenda, Astronomy Prof. Sally
Oey addressed the group about
IT Rationalization, a "parallel
effort" to the shared services
initiative, scheduled to roll out
2014.
Though not implemented yet,
the administration's plan is to
consolidate IT services offered
throughout the different
departments within the Uni-
versity as part of their efforts to
improve efficiency and cut $120
million in costs by 2017. The
project aims to decrease redun-
dancy by generalizing IT staff.
While Oey - a member of
the Senate Assembly Commit-
tee on University Affairs - said
there's room for standardiza-
tion within some of the Uni-
versity's IT departments, she
expressed concern about how
the cutbacks would impact
departments with more spe-
cialized technological needs.
Representing the Department
of Astronomy, Oey also said she
feels the needs of her depart-
ments are "falling through the
cracks" and the effects the unit
is already feeling are "exceed-
ingly painful."
A representative from the
University of Michigan, Dear-
born campus said she was sur-
prised to learn these rollbacks

hadn't already taken place on
the Ann Arbor campus, since
Dearborn already implemented
these changes on that campus
without staff input.
SACUA member Finn Larsen
said he understood the con-
cerns but wasn't surprised the
administration had chosen to
consolidate IT support staff
because "personnel is where
the money is."
Though some concerns about
rationalization are not yet
resolved, there are plans under-
way to invite Chief Information
OfficerLaura Patterson to an
upcoming assembly meeting
so the group can express their
concerns to the University's
technology czar.
When Social Work prof.
Karen Staller, chair of SACUA,
asked the group if they felt their
deans had been open with them
about the consolidation pro-
cess, the reply was a brief out-
burst of laughter. Department
administrators were issued
a gag order last week, which
insisted that they do not talk
about how individuals would be
effected by the Shared Services
Center, a similar effort.
The meeting continued on
with a follow-up discussion
of benefits, introduced at last
month's meeting when Lau-
rita Thomas, vice president of
human resources, answered the
faculty's questions regarding
the changing benefits policies.
Adjunct Law prof. Scott Mas-
ten led the follow-up discus-
sion, which ultimately resulted
in the unanimous passing of a
resolution addressing the com-
mittee's communal frustration
with the administration's lack
of transparency.
Larry Jones, a non-voting
representative for University
retirees, said he wholeheart-

ANN ARBOR
City Council
debates
crosswalk
ordinance
Council approves
first reading of
changed ordinance
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily Staff Reporter
The Ann Arbor City Council
attempted to come one step clos-
er to solving the city's evident
pedestrian safety issues Monday
night.
The city council approved the
first reading of the ordinance to
repeal the city's crosswalk ordi-
nance, which has been criticized
for conflicting with the state
traffic code.
Only Mayor John Hieftje,
Christopher Taylor (D-Ward
3) and Margie Teall (D-Ward
4) voted not to approve the first
reading.
The ordinance differs from
the Michigan Uniform Traffic
Code in that Ann Arbor's code
adds that a driver must stop at
a crosswalk even ifa pedestrian
is on the curb waiting to cross a
street. The state code explains
that drivers should yield the
right-of-way when a pedestrian
is in a crosswalk on the half of the
roadway on which the vehicle is
traveling, or when the pedestrian
is approaching closely from the
opposite site of the freeway
Should the ordinance pass, the
driver of any vehicle would no
longer be legally obliged to stop
at pedestrian crossings or yield
to pedestrians waiting to walk.
It would mean that drivers must
stop only when a pedestrian is
actively crossing in a crosswalk.
Craig Hupy, the city's interim
public services area adminis-
trator, told the council that the
repeal would not change where
and how they place crosswalks,
but it would change how signs
around crosswalks are marked,

Zimmerman charged with assault
after attacking girlfriend, property

Forum connects local
transit agencies to public

Girlfriend calls police,
claims pointed a shotgun
at her in their home
APOPKA, Fla. (AP) - George Zimmerman was
charged with assault Monday after his girlfriend called
deputies to the home where they were living and claimed
he pointed a shotgun at her during an argument, authori-
ties said.
The girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, called 911 in the
early afternoon to say that Zimmerman had smashed a
glass table, threatened her with the shotgun and ulti-
mately pushed her out of the house, according to an arrest
report. After pushing her out, Zimmerman barricaded
the door with furniture and refused to leave, saying that
he would talk to police by phone, authorities said.
The arrest was the latest legal problem for Zimmer-
man since he was acquitted in July of criminal charges in
the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black
teen. The case sparked accusations that Zimmerman had
racially profiled Martin and led to nationwide debates
over the so-called Stand Your Ground defense laws in
Florida and other states.
"You point your gun at my fricking face," Samantha
Scheibe is heard telling Zimmerman on a 911 call. "Get
*hiOU

out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please
get out of my house."
Seconds later, she told the dispatcher, "You kidding
me? He pushed me out of my house and locked me out.
... He knows how to do this. Ie knows how to play this
game."
Moments later, Zimmerman called 911 from inside the
barricaded house to tell his side of the story.
"I have a girlfriend, who for lack of a better word, has
gone crazy on me," Zimmerman said.
Zimmerman then said he never pulled a gun on his
girlfriend, and that it was Scheibe who smashed a table
at the home they shared. He also told the dispatcher that
Scheibe was pregnant with their child and that she had
decided she would raise the child on her owsn. When
Zimmerman started to leave, "she got mad," he said.
Seminole County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chief Den-
nis Lemma said at a news conference that Scheibe wasn't
pregnant.
Deputies used a key provided by Scheibe to unlock the
door and they were able to push through the barricade of
items, Lemma said.
"She was very concerned for her own safety especially
having the weapon pointed at her and then being pushed
out," he said.
Lemma says Zimmerman was compliant and unarmed
when deputies came to the house.
"The easiest way to describe it is rather
passive. Clearly, he's had the opportunity to
encounter situations similar to this in the
past," he said.
Zimmerman was charged with domestic
aggravated assault with a weapon, domes-
tic battery and criminal mischief. His first
court appearance was scheduled for Tuesday
afternoon. He will be housed in a single-per-
son cell and guards will check on him hourly,
Lemma added.
Scheibe told deputies that the ordeal start-
ed with a verbal argument and that she asked
Zimmerman to leave the house. Her account
in the arrest report says he began packing his
4 belongings, including a shotgun and an assault
rifle. She says she began putting his things in
the living room and outside the house, and he
became upset. At that point, the report says, he
took the shotgun out of its case.
Zimmerman told his girlfriend to leave
and smashed a pair of her sunglasses as she
5r M walked toward the front door, the report
says. Scheibe told deputies that he pushed
her out of the house when she got close to the
door.

Forum for Ann Arbor
residents dispells
transportation confusion
By WILL GREENBURG
Daily StaffReporter
The Hatcher Graduate Library played host
Monday night to the Washtenaw Area Trans-
portation Study's transit forum with city
planners, local residents and representatives
gathering to hear status updates on the cur-
rent projects.
Guests were greeted with food, drinks and
18 different representatives from The Con-
nector high-capacity transit project, Ann
Arbor Area Transportation Authority and
Clean Energy Coalition all gathered together
for the first forum of its kind to inform the
public on the county's current transit projects
and answer questions.
WATS Director Ryan Buck said it's hard for
area residents to attend each individual meet-
ing for various initiatives and the forum was a
good opportunity to inform the public. Buck
said the projects have various timelines and
roadblocks to overcomebut that funding is an
issue across most initiatives.
"Funding is the most critical issue facing
transportation planners and transportation
infrastructure right now," Buck said. "It's
criticallyand chronicallyunderfunded."
Project leaders shared optimism for their
plans, the most notable being the commuter
and high-speed rail projects as well as The
Ride's urban core focus.
Alex Bourgeau, an intermodal transporta-
tion coordinator at the Southeast Michigan
Council of Governments, said the forum was a
great opportunity to disentangle the rail proj-
ects going on in southeast Michigan. There
are currently three major projects: the high-
speed rail program, the MITrain Southeast
Michigan Commuter Rail Service, and the
Washtenaw and Livingston Line, commonly
referred to as WALLY.
The MITrain cars and track, which
includes the WALLY line, are complete and
should start running special trains next year
between Ann Arbor and Detroit for major
events, such as Detroit Tiger's games or the
Ann Arbor Art Fair, Bourgeau said. The line is
roughly two to three years away from regular
service, he said.
Meanwhile, Bourgeau said the high-speed
rail line should reach speeds of 110 miles per
hour between Detroit and Chicago along
some portions of the track and should be

finalized by 2017. He said in addition to being
faster, theline should help clearup congestion
in high-traffic areas such as outside Chicago
where freight, commercial and other rail all
converge.
"Really, the two services in this corridor
could complement each other," Bourgeau
said.
Ann Arbor resident Keith LaSalle was
excited about the prospect of the new rail
services. However, he stressed having a con-
crete plan before he could fully support the
projects.
"I love the concept - if done properly and
if the planners are fiscally responsible in mak-
ing ithappen," LaSalle said.
Expanding bus services
The expansion of AAATA bus services,
also known as TheRide, was another point of
interest for many at the forum, with Michael
Benham, TheRide's special assistant for stra-
tegic planning, sharing a plan that would
expand service by 44 percent. Benham said
the much needed improvements will add
routes and increase service and frequency.
"We've got people walking down Washt-
enaw Avenue after11(p.m.)because they can't
catch abus," Benham said. "We've got people
in (Ypsilanti) who can't get to the grocery
store on a Sunday or Saturday, so the needs
there are critical."
- At the time, Benham said the changes
would go much smootherifthe AnnArbor City
Council approved adding Ypsilanti Township
into the AAATA, which represents multiple
municipalities. Tuesday evening, the council
did approve the township's membership. Now,
a millage is needed to approve the plan.
State Rep. Gretchen Driskell (D-Saline),
who attended the forum, said she is con-
cerned about the additional funding need for
the project,butsupports anincreasedempha-
sis on public transportation.
"The state has historically been more
oriented towards road construction versus
alternative modes of transportation, transit,
non-motorized, like biking," Driskell said.
"There is definitely movement recognizing
the importance of transit."
Other booths at the forum, such as the
Clean Energy Coalition's Bike Share program
and the Program to Educate All Cyclists,
focused on promoting bike riding in Ann
Arbor, and booths from the Ann Arbor Proj-
ect Management Services Unit and Washt-
enaw County Road Commission shared
results from recent projects.

Toronto Mayor causes scene
at hearing to limit his powers

Despite his
controversial past,
Ford says ouster is
politically-motivated
TORONTO (AP) - Amid cries
of "Shame! Shame!" scandal-
plagued Toronto Mayor Rob
Ford was stripped of the last of
his meaningful powers Mon-
day after a heated City Council
debate in which he argued with
members of the public, charged
hecklers and knocked a council-
woman down.
Ford called the move a "coup
d'etat" and vowed an "outright
war" in next year's mayoral
election.
"What's happening here
today is not a democratic pro-
cess, it's a dictatorship process,"
the 44-year-old mayor declared.
The council lacks the
power to remove Ford from
office unless he is convicted
of a crime. Instead, members
sought the strongest recourse
available after recent revela-
tions that Ford smoked crack
cocaine and was drunk at pub-
lic events.

Ford later said in a TV inter-
view Monday night on the Cana-
dian Broadcasting Corp. that he
was "finished" with alcohol,
acknowledging that his drink-
ing had resulted in "excessive,
stupid, immature behavior."
Earlier Monday, the council
voted overwhelmingly in favor
of slashing Ford's office bud-
get by 60 percent and allowing
his staff to move to the deputy
mayor, who now takes on many
of the mayor's former powers.
Ford now effectively has no
legislative power and no longer
chairs the executive committee,
although he retains his title and
ability to represent Toronto at
official functions.
The debate became raucous
after Ford paced around the
council chamber and traded
barbs with members of the pub-
lic. The speaker asked security
to clear the gallery and a recess
was called, but not before Ford
barreled toward his detractors,
mowing into Councilor Pam
McConnell.
Another councilor asked
Ford to apologize. Ford said he
was rushing to the defense of
his brother, Councilor Doug
Ford, and accidentally knocked

McConnell down.
"I picked her up," he said. "I
ran around because I thought
my brother was getting into an
altercation."
Visibly shaken after Ford ran
her over, McConnell, a petite
woman in her 60s, said she
never expected the chaos that
broke out.
"This is the seat of democ-
racy. It is not a football field. I
just wasn't ready. Fortunately,
the mayor's staff was in front.
They stopped me from hitting
my head against the wall. I just
need to sit down," McConnell
said.
The motion to strip Ford of
his powers was revised from
a tougher version to ward off
potential legal challenges by
letting Ford keep his title and
represent the city at official
functions. The city's lawyer said
Ford was not reduced to being
"mayor in name only."
"Obviously I cannot do the
job with eight people in the
office with a quarter of the for-
mer mayor's budget," Ford said.
Council members said it was
necessary to restrict the mayor's
powers given his erratic behav-
ior.

Kailasapathy further noted
that the repeal of the ordinance
is simply step one, and that other

safety through means of infra-
structure and enforcement.
Safety on Seventh, a group
founded by Ann Arbor resident
Chris Hewett, is composed of
residents that attempt to inform
other residents of the traffic
problems and pedestrian safety
issues in Ann Arbor. Hewett and
his group argue that most of the
safety issues stem from a lack of
enforcement of traffic laws, main-
ly speeding.
Hewett told the council Mon-
day night before the vote that the
lack of respect for pedestrians has
become alarming and will con-
tinue to be a problem -regardless
of the council's decision on the
ordinance.
"The fact is the city of Ann
Arbor still has major traffic and
pedestrian issues that must be
addressed," Hewett said. "Per-
sonally, I find it disgusting that
Ann Arbor continues to allow
pedestrians to be hit and cars to
drive at speeds upwards of 70
miles per hour on our neighbor-
hood streets.

Hong Kong struggles with effects
of black market ivory trade

Government unsure
of how to eliminate
large deposits of
illegal ivory
HONG KONG (AP) - When
Hong Kong intercepted yet
another huge shipment of illegal
African ivory in early October,
it added to a growing headache
for authorities: What exactly do
you do with one of the world's
biggest stockpiles of elephant
tusks?
Government warehouses in
the former British colony are
holding more than 30 metric
tons of ivory seized since 2008,
as customs agents intercept a
surging amount of endangered
animal products being smug-
gled to mainland China to meet
demand from the country's
newly wealthy.
The latest shipment, 189
tusks worth $1.5 million hidden
in soybean sacks in a shipping
container, was one of four major
busts this year.
Ivory is known as "white
gold" because of the rich prices
it commands on the black mar-
ket. Hong Kong has put values
of between $1,000 and $2,000 a
kilogram on ivory it seized this
year. A 2011 report by the Inter-
national Fund for Animal Wel-
fare said buyers in China were
paying up to $2,400 a kilogram.
Conservation groups, wor-
ried the ivory pile presents
a target for theft and fails to
send a signal that Hong Kong
is serious about cracking down
on the trade, urge the govern-

ment to destroy it. Authorities
are resisting, instead prefer-
ring to dole out small amounts
to schools to raise conservation
awareness.
"As long as that ivory is kept
anywhere, it will always be a
temptation for people to get
their hands on it," said Grace
Ge Gabriel, the fund's regional
director.
IFAW and 15 other ani-
mal welfare and conservation
groups wrote to Hong Kong's
leader and customs commis-
sioner after the October seizure,
urging them to follow the exam-
ple of countries that destroy
confiscated ivory.
Because the ivory trade is
illegal, its size worldwide is
hard to pin down. Samuel K.
Wasser, director of the Center
for Conservation Biology at
the University of Washington,
calculated it was worth $264
million from 2000-2010. He
said the amount now is likely
to be far higher based on the
soaring amount confiscated
globally.
IFAW estimates 35,000
elephants a year are killed
by poachers for ivory, risking
extinction of the animal in the
wild.
Demand is fuelled by China's
booming economy, which has
created a vast middle class with
the ability to buy ivory carvings
prized as status symbols.
"The Chinese market remains
the paramount destination for
illicit ivory," according to a
report this year by the U.N., the
Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species
and wildlife trade monitoring

network TRAFFIC.
It said China's involvement
has been growing since 1996
despite "increasing levels of law
enforcement."
In their letter, the groups
pointed to "high profile ivory
destruction measures" over the
years. Kenya held the world's
first large ivory bonfire in 1989,
torching 12 tons in an event
that drew international atten-
tion and helped lead to a global
ban the following year on ivory
sales between countries. Zam-
bia set fire to 9.5 tons in 1992
and Gabon burned nearly 5 tons
in 2012.
In June, the Philippines
became the first Asian country
to destroy its stocks when it
burned and crushed more than
5 tons of ivory worth an esti-
mated $10 million confiscated
since 2009. The United States
last week destroyed more than
6 tons of ivory tusks, carvings
and jewelry seized over 25 years
and urged other nations to fol-
low suit.
Hong Kong's stockpile is sev-
eral times bigger. Destroying it
would be a mammoth task. The
government won't disclose the
exact amount, though says the
bulk of it is made up of 32.6 tons
seized since 2003, with amounts
rising sharply in recent years.
Some 7.2 tons have been confis-
cated so far in 2013, double the
amount in 2011.
Other busts this year include
$5.3 million in ivory, rhino
horns and leopard skins from
Nigeria in August; $2.2 million
of ivory from Togo in July; and
a $1.4 million shipment from
Kenya in January.

UN climate chief calls on coal industry
to invest in renewable energy sources

Diplomat says
companies need to
help reduce emissions
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The
top U.N. climate diplomat on
Monday told the coal industry it
should leave most of the world's
remaining coal reserves in the
ground and start investing in
renewable energy sources.
Speaking at a coal summit on
the sidelines of a U.N. climate
conference in Warsaw, Christia-
na Figueres said the coal indus-
try needs to change radically to
help reduce the carbon emissions
that scientists say are warming
the planet.
"The world is rising to meet
the climate challenge as risks of
inaction mount, and it is in your
best interest to make coal part of
the solution," Figueres said.
The coal event was seen as a
provocation by climate activ-
ists, who used a crane to reach
the ministry's roof, where they
unfurled banners criticizing
Poland's - and the world's -
reliance on coal and other fossil
fuels. Police used another crane
to take them down, as panelists
at the coal summit said that the
people in the room, not the peo-
ple on the roof, have the possibil-
ity to change the coal industry.
Coal industry officials at the
event didn't directly address
her remarks but said the world

cannot do without coal because
in many countries it's the only
available energy source.
"A major aim of the summit
has been to encourage open and
constructive dialogue on the cli-
mate challenge - we're not going
to meet our climate objectives if
we are not all part of the solu-
tion," the World Coal Associa-
tion, which organized the event,
said in a statement.
Polish Economy Minister
Janusz Piechocinski, whose
country generates about 90 per-
cent of its electricity from coal,
said: "You cannot have a low-
emissions energy transformation
without talking about coal."
Coal accounts for less than
30 percent of the world's energy
supply but more than 40 percent
of energy emissions, according to
the International Energy Agency.
Figueres, who was criticized
by some climate activists for
attending the conference, noted
coal's role in economic develop-
ment since the industrial revo-
lution but said it's come at "an
unacceptably high cost to human
and environmental health."
She said aging, high-polluting
coal plants must be closed and
new plants should implement
technologies that allow for emis-
sions to be trapped before they
are released into the atmosphere.
Such technologies are expensive
and currently not widely used.
To bring down CO2 emissions
to levels that would avoid dan-

gerous levels of warming, most
of the existingcoal reserves must
be left in the ground, Figueres
said.
"Some major oil, gas and ener-
gy technology companies are
already investing in renewables,
and I urge those of you who have
not yet started to join them,"
Figueres said.
Back at the U.N. conference
later Monday, she told reporters
she didn't expect any major shift
in the industry's deployment of
capital anytime soon.
"They really need to do a
major, major rethink," Figueres
said. "So I don't expect them to
stand up immediately and go,
'We are ready for the challenge
right now,' but I do expect them
to take the message very seri-
ously."
That message was echoed by
U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern.
"The world runs significantly
on fossil fuels right now and
that's not going to change over-
night," he said. "But at the same
time if we're going to get a grip
on climate change ... the balance
of energy in countries all over
the world is going to have to tilt
much more toward non-fossil
sources."
Coal emissions have declined
in the U.S. as some power plants
have switched to lower-priced
natural gas. But they are grow-
ing fast in China and India to
meet the energy needs of their
fast-growingeconomies.

Greenlighting Google Books keeps education open and accessible
After eight years of trial, U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin ruled Nov.
14 that Google did not infringe upon copyright laws when it began
scanning texts into Google Books, its massive, searchable online
library. The judge said Google acknowledges that it did not receive explicit
permission from authors to publish certain texts since receiving acceptance
from millions of authors would prove unfeasible. The company acted
within the "fair use" exception to copyright infringement. The ruling
has made it easier to legally obtain, share and use books for educational
information and creative stimulation - a major victory toward achieving
open, accessible education. Other courts in cases like this should accept
the broad definition of fair use in order to continue this trend of accessible

resources for the public good.
The fair use exception to copyright infringe-
ment has four requirements: First, it must pro-
duce creative stimulation while not using the
text for personal profit. Second, the text must
be published, not private. Third, the source
may only use a fraction of the whole text, and,
fourth, use of the text cannot harm the market
for purchasing a novel. Google Books fulfills
all of these requirements, as the judge rightly
decided. Potential readers are able to quickly
search, purchase or rent copies of books, so
people can easily find specific books while also
discovering recommendations for other texts.
Or, as Chin wrote, "Google Books digitizes
books and transforms expressive text into a
comprehensive word index that helps readers,
scholars, researchers and others find books."
opponents, notably the Author's Guild,
the organization that originally filed the suit
against Google, claim the search engine fails
under the fair use provision by providing too
many direct quotes from a book, allowing
Google Books users to read a text in its entirety
through its online previews. However, Chin
denied this, arguing, "Google Books does not
supersede or supplant books because it is not
a tool to be used to read books." Users can see
a only few pages of a novel per preview and a
portion of each novel is never scanned into the
system, proving that using Google Books to

read an entire work is seriously impractical, if
not impossible.
The innovative Google project is beneficial
to authors. After searching a book, users can
click on a link to purchase a copy from vari-
ous online sellers. Since the engine allows
easy access to find and purchase texts while
also allowing readers to find new texts based
on recommendations, authors actually have
the opportunity to generate a greater profit.
Additionally, many of the technical texts that
may be useful to students are not products
that were written with profitable intent.
The ruling also helps the University in its
contribution to HathiTrust, an innovative
project that connects the online libraries
of the University and other major academic
institutions. Because the University was
an original contributor to the online data-
base, this case establishes a precedent for
the HathiTrust project. The decision also
encourages the University to continue digi-
tizing texts, furthering opportunities for
public knowledge.
In making this ruling, Chin encourages
public learning. By definition, fair use allows
the use of copyrighted text if it mutually ben-
efits every party, and in this case, it does.
Allowing Google Books to continue use cre-
ates a legal precedent that will encourage

one around me was unhappy and
worried about failing."
And when it comes to the rigor
of the curriculum, Claire said the
attitude among some of the pro-
fessors was, " 'Well, we did it this
way when we were in school, so you
should have to as well.'"
"I was miserable."
Claire has since switched her
degree program and although her
story is just one of many, statistics
indicate that her experiences may
unfortunately not be unique or even
uncommon. At the University, 20
percent of the entering class of engi-
neers will transfer or not complete
their degree - a number that, while
much lower than the national aver-
age, is still 10-percent higher than
the drop-out rate of the University
as a whole. Nationally, fewer than
half of students who enter science,
technology, engineering and math
fields complete their degrees within
six years.
These statistics enforce the idea
that many elements of our current
standard of engineering education
are outdated and in need of overhaul.
It's no secret that engineering
is difficult. Recent studies have

Campus is no place for hatred

Keeping the movement inclusive

At the Victors for Michigan launch event
Nov. 8, a T-shirt was sighted with the mes-
sage "Victors for Moral Antigayism," along-
side an image of a cross. While we don't know
the individual who chose to make and wear
this message, nor his motivations, we invite
him to meet with us as leaders of our respec-
tive faith-based groups. We welcome the
opportunity to share with him why we feel
there's no place at the University of Michigan
- or anywhere - for hatred or anti-gay activ-
ism, especially associated with a religious
symbol. As faith leaders on this campus, we
seek to create positive spaces for students to
deepen their religious and spiritual beliefs,
while also respecting the diversity of views
and identities that exist on this campus.
Messages like this serve to intimidate and
alienate other students, at an event that was
intended to bring our victors together in a
positive, affirming space.
We support and reinforce this student's
right to hold strong religious beliefs that
guide his morals, ethics, values and actions.
Associating a cross, however, with an anti-
gay message does not represent the values of
many of our Christian and other faith-based
groups on campus. Many of our organiza-

tions are actively inclusive of the LGBTQ
community, and several are certified allies
through the Spectrum Center's Ally Devel-
opment Training program. The Victors
event was about showcasing "the Leaders
and the Best" that this campus offers. The
presence of an anti-gay message had no
place at the event or on this campus. We
look forward to continuing to work in part-
nership with Student Life and the Office of
Development to ensure our motto of Expect
Respect is upheld on our campus.

Recently, there has been a
great deal of discussion
on campus about diver-
sity. with the
vast majority of
students hail-
ing from white,
upper-class
backgrounds,
the University of
Michigan, one of _
the top universi- KATE
ties in the coun- LARAMIE
try, is severely
lacking in a
diverse student body. Our Universi-
ty's failure to create a more inclusive,
diverse campus has been the source
of understandable concern and con-
tention among minority and low-
income students, and their allies.
Student groups have taken it upon
themselves to educate and fight for
the creation of a future University
that's not so obviously dominated by
one student demographic.
I've seen many parallels between
the fight to diversify our campus
and the push of the environmental
movement to build a more inclusive
atmosphere toward one no longer
dominated by white individuals of
privileged backgrounds. Since the
inception of mainstream environ-
mentalism in the 1960s, the move-
ment has become stamped as a
crusade of the upper-middle class
- those who have both the time
and money needed to support envi-
ronmental lobbying, campaigns and
protection. While the hippie cul-
ture of the 60s and 70s instigated
a societal shift that emphasized a
greater appreciation and concern
for the preservation and protection
of the natural world, the movement
also brought a stereotyped por-
trayal of the environmentalist as a
white, liberal college student of the
Woodstock era.

Toussaint's job maybe in
jeopardy after concussion

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
For the better part of three sea-
sons, fifth-year senior Fitzgerald
Toussaint has been the running
back of choice for Michigan coach
Brady Hoke's football team. He
powered a resurgent downhill
running game in 2011. In 2012, he
toiled through a forgettable sea-
son, which ended with a leg injury,
but his job was never in danger.
Now, 10 games into 2013, Tous-
saint's position is in jeopardy
as Michigan prepares for Iowa.
As Toussaint sat out every snap
against Northwestern on Satur-
day - due to complications from
a concussion, Hoke said Monday
- freshmen running backs Der-
rick Green and De'Veon Smith
were the motor behind the Wol-
verines'best rushingperformance
in weeks.
This week, Toussaint is still
listed as the starter on the depth
chart. But that could soon change.
"I think we'll have a pretty
good decision to make at the end
of the week," Hoke said.
On Saturday, Hoke said Tous-
saint remains the starter for now.
On Monday, Hoke clarified that
Toussaint missed practice last
week with a concussion. Tous-
saint participated in practice later
in the week but not enough to con-
vince coaches he was prepared for
the Wildcats.
Hoke said Toussaint shouldn't
miss any practice this week as
Michigan gets ready for the Hawk-
eyes. Typically, the team practices
on Sunday, but Hoke instead chose
to use that day for film study and
positional meetings. When full
practice resumes, the three backs
will fight for the starting job.
"I think we always have a com-

Fifth-year senior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint suffered a concussion last week and didn't play against Northwestern.

petition," Hoke said. "We'll see
where we shake out at the end of
the week with who will be the first
back in."
In Toussaint's absence, Green
earned the start against the Wild-
cats, and he handled the bulk of
the carries. Together with Smith,
the two running backs totaled 120
yards on 27 carries - Green 79
yards on 19 carries, Smith 41 on
eight.
That was a major upgrade on
the previous two weeks, when the
Wolverines failed to gain posi-
tive yardage on the ground. The
freshmen running backs did sev-
eral things well, Hoke said. But a
lot of the production is a credit to
the offensive line, which managed
to get a push for the first time in
weeks.

"We were in the black this time,
which is where you want to be as
an offense," said fifth-year senior
left tackle Taylor Lewan. "That's
huge, you can't just be a one-
dimensional offense."
Hoke said the embattled interi-
or of the offensive line established
the line of scrimmage and strung
together combination blocks to
the second level. At the same time,
offensive coordinator Al Borge's
use of bubble screens pulled in
the linebackers, which opened up
more running lanes. The offensive
line's targeting - finding the right
defender to block and then execut-
ing that block - was the best Hoke
has seen all year.
"You know what I'm going to
say, we weren't perfect," Hoke
said. "But we got movement."

With the offensive line get-
ting a push, Green and Smith had
the running style to gain yards.
Green, listed at 5-foot-11 and 240
pounds,had beenlargelyunable to
use his size to overpower defend-
ers, but he showed more power
on Saturday. Hoke said he doesn't
know how much Green currently
weighs.
Smith, listed at 5-foot-11 and
224 pounds, is also a bruising
back. Toussaint, meanwhile,
weighs just 200 pounds.
Does that mean Green and
Smith are best suited to Michi-
gan's offense?
"That's a hard question because
Fitz has done so good at some of
the things the last couple years,
three years," Hoke said. "And so
there's a fit for all three of them."

Michigan steamrollsBroncos

By ALEJANDRO ZUI4GA
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team
has done more than enough to
earn its top-five ranking, beating
three different ranked teams dur-
ing non-confer-
ence play and NOTEBOOK
avoiding bad
losses. Ten games into the season,
though, the Wolverines have also
benefited from their fair share of
luck.
Good teams find a way to win,
but No. 5 Michigan (7-2-1) has
made just about every game an
ordeal. In the Wolverines' last
seven contests, they've gone 5-2.
Each and every one of those was
decided by a single goal, the lon-
gest such streak in the NCAA.
That penchant for high-pres-
sure games was in full effect last
weekend against Nebraska-Oma-
ha. On Friday, the Wolverines car-
ried a 2-l lead into the third period
before surrendering two goals in
a three-minute span. The teams
were deadlocked for the rest of the
frame despite a relentless Michi-
gan attack.
The following night, the Wol-
verines dominated the second
periodtwice openingup two-goal
leads. Then the Mavericks scored
a pair, and Michigan needed a late
winner to escape.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
lamented the defense for its mis-
cues, which left goaltenders Zach
Nagelvoort and Steve Racine out
to dry on several occasions. But
as they've done all year, both net-
minders performed well enough
for the Wolverines to win.
"The only reason we have a
winning record is because of our
goals against and our save per-
centage," Berenson said.

Daily Sports Writer
In a season of transition, the
Michigan women's basketball
team is taking small victories
on the court and turning them
into wins. Such was the case on
Monday night in Kalamazoo,
Mich. as the Wolverines estab-
lished a formidable lead over
Western Michigan by focusing
on collecting rebounds. Michi-
gan defeat-
ed the MICHIGAN 73
Broncos WMU 45
for its sec-
ond consecutive victory against
in-state opponents, 73-45.
After trailing from tipoff
to the first media timeout, the
Wolverines took a 10-9 lead
on back-to-back baskets from
junior forward Shannon Smith
and freshman guard Siera
Thompson. After Michigan took
the lead, it never relinquished it.
By the end of the first half, the
Wolverines had out-rebounded
the Broncos, 35-15, after going
on a 24-2 run spanning seven
minutes.
Three former Wolverines sat
in the crowd and watched the
quick transformation unfold:
Sam Arnold, Jenny Ryan and
Rachel Sheffer. Sheffer is a cur-
rent Bronco who, after hanging
up her maize and blue basket-
ball jersey, headed to Western
Michigan to play volleyball
in her last year of eligibility.
Tonight, though, she cheered
for her former team and coach.
"It was an exciting night,
and any time we can have those
three back in the crowd, it real-
ly gets our team fired up," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico.
Junior forward Nicole
Emblad took command on the
court with eight points and tied
her career-high 13 rebounds,
while also leading the offense
with four assists. Junior for-
ward Cyesha Goree, who kept
the Wolverines in the game
early on with their first four
points, recorded her second
double-double of the season,
with 13 points and a career-high
15 rebounds.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Freshman forward JT Compher scored theefirst two goals of his career last week.

the first eight games of the season,
but one thing was notably absent:
goals.
That all changed in Omaha,
where Compher scored his first
two of the season.
On Friday, he recorded his sixth
assist by feeding senior forward
Luke Moffatt for Michigan's first
goal of the night. Minutes later,
Moffatt fired a shot off the post,
and Compher slapped the rebound
into the net.
"I knew it was just a matter of
time," Berenson said. "I was hop-
ing he would score sooner rather
than later. I'm glad he got it over
with."
Compher didn't need any help
the following night. Defending
aggressively on the penalty kill,
the freshman poked the puck
away from a Nebraska-Omaha
attacker before racing down the
ice. He then used a smooth back-
hand-forehand deke to tally his
second goal of the weekend.
"I wasn't surprised when he

came back with another one,"
Berenson said. "He's played well
right from day one, but it's nice as
a good player to get rewarded with
some points."
SZUMA SKATES: Michigan
was exposed defensively for the
first time all season against the
Mavericks, but the struggles were
magnified by a lack of available
personnel.
Last week, junior defenseman
Mike Szuma suffered an upper-
body injury and didn't travel with
the team to Omaha as a result. The
Wolverines only had six defenders
available for the two-game series.
Michigan gave up three goals
for just the second time all season
on Friday and surrendered three
more Saturday.
Szuma skated Monday, and
Berenson said his progress will
be assessed throughout the week
before he determines whether the
defenseman will be available for
the Wolverines' upcoming game
Friday against Niagara.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Junior forward Cyesha Goreefinished wth 13 points and 15 rebounds Monday.

"Offensively, we weren't
knocking down shots right away
at the beginning of the game,
but I think Cyesha did a really
good job of getting on the board
early on," Elmblad said. "So I
think that the turnaround was
a combination of our defense
and knocking down shots on the
offensive end."
Michigan shot 58 percent
from the field in the second half,
and with just over 10 minutes
left, doubled Western Michigan
up with a 62-31 lead, its biggest
of the night. The Wolverines
never allowed the Broncos a
chance to fathom a comeback
after gaining the lead - Goree,
Smith and Thompson all scored
in double figures, and Michigan
out-rebounded Western Michi-
gan by 30.
"What's really exciting is
that rebounding stat," Elmblad

said. "That's one of our points of
emphasis - getting to the glass
not only on the offensive end,
but boxing them out and getting
defensive rebounds."
Senior forward Val Driscoll
got some playing time in the
second half, scoring eight points
in 13 minutes, tier career high.
Junior forward Nicole Flyer, a
walk-on and former rower, also
saw time off the bench in the
second half and contributed two
points off free throws. Their
contributions, while small,
added to the 18 bench points
Michigan racked up against the
Broncos.
"I thought the other night
Shannon just didn't miss a shot,
and you know that's not going to
happen night in and night out,"
Barnes Arico said. "It's nice
when you have everybody con-
tributing."

5 Things We Learned: Iowa State

0

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
1. Mitch McGary is not at 100
percent.
Despite playing in his first
game of the season, sophomore
forward Mitch McGary is not
close to being the player the
nation saw in the NCAA Tourna-
ment last year.
Just five days ago, McGary
took part in a 60-minute practice
for the first time since his back
injury, after being limited to indi-
vidual practices and workouts
with a coach on the side. It wasn't
until Saturday that McGary took
part in his first full practice.
According to Michigan coach
John Beilein, McGary has only
had one-and-a-half days of reps
with the first team before Sun-
day's game. Knowing that, it's
clear that McGary will need some
practice and, more importantly,
game action early on to get back
in playing shape.
Such was the reason that
McGary played only 22 minutes,
divided into 3-5 minute spurts.
One of the reasons that McGary
was able to play was because he
didn't feel sore after Saturday's
practice and said he felt comfort-
able enough in warmups before
the game to give it a go. And with
that, Beilein was willing to let
him.
And Beilein, for the most part,
was rewarded as McGary put up
nine points, six rebounds and
four steals.
"Let's just get him in the game,
right, and see where it goes."
Beilein said. "As long as we don't
overtax his body and get him in
and out, and a suggestion was to
keep him on the bike in between
to just keep him warm, as he grad-
ually gets into playing shape."
2. There's still no clear go-to
option late in the game.
Though sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas did score 15 points in the
second half - out of his team-high
20 - and was the Wolverines' hot
hand in the game, he's still not
the person to take the last shot for
Michigan. In fact, even Beilein
doesn't know who that person
will be moving forward.
And that's OK.

Zak Irvin and his 6-foot-6, 200-
pound frame more minutes if
it appears Levert doesn't have
his shot. Conversely, depending
on McGary's return to playing
shape, a big lineup with McGary
and either redshirt junior Jon
Horford or fifth-year senior for-
ward Jordan Morgan might see
more time later in games.
4. Derrick Walton Jr. gained
experience he'll need down the
road.
Playing in his first away game
in college, freshman guard Der-
rick Walton Jr. looked impres-
sive. Pouring in 13 points, Walton
showed off his flash against the
Cyclones, getting to the basket on
several occasions.
But at the same time, he looked
like the rookie he is. After bank-
ing in his first shot of the game
from behind the arc, Walton
cooled as he missed his next four
attempts from deep.
Still, Walton improved his
career high in points for the third
straight game, after scoring 12
and six points the two previous
games.
"In an environment like this,
our freshmen are definitely going
to learn a lot, cause it's their first
game on the road," Stauskas said.
"For all of us, it's just a bond-
ing opportunity, it's a time to get
better on the road. Really come
together when everyone's going
against you."
5. Bold Prediction: McGary will
start each game in Puerto Rico.
Beilein made an interest-
ing point in his postgame press
conference on Sunday. Speaking
about bigs in college basketball,
he said that they can't play for
more than three to four minutes
because of how quick the game is
currently.
Given that, why wouldn't
Beilein start his best big man,
even if he's not in his best playing
condition at the moment? Michi-
gan will play at least two games
- and possibly three - this week
and, with McGary barely getting
any time recently with the first
team, it marks the perfect oppor-
tunityfor himto get minuteswith
them, even if he's playing just a
couple minutes.

Michigan had its chances replacing the late-game heroics
throughout the game. Despite let- of Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey

Whether it was from any of think we're too worried about
those or not, Michigan was able that."

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Sophomore forward Mitch McGary scored nine points in his first game of the year.

3. LeVert can't be relied on
every game.
After averaging 20.5 points in
Michigan's first two regular-sea-
son games, LeVert finally fell back
to earth a bit on Sunday. Though
he did play a career-high 37 min-
utes, LeVert regressed back to the
mean, scoring just five points on
2-for-9 shooting.
Despite putting on 15 pounds
in the offseason, LeVert looked
overmatched late in the game
when defensive switches forced
him to guard Iowa State's Melvin
Ejim, a 6-foot-6 power forward
that constantly used his 220-

pound body to back up and post-
up at the hoop.
Needing shooters and height
to battle him and Georges Niang,
though, Beilein had to keep
LeVert on the floor as Michigan
started to fade and then attempt
to come back late in the game.
But unlike in the Wolver-
ines' game against South Caro-
lina State, LeVert didn't go 6-for-7
from beyond the arc. Instead, he
went 1-for-5 as Michigan strug-
gled, shooting just 8-for-29 from
three.
Though it was just one game,
LeVert's struggle could force
Beilein to give freshman guard

to learn a lesson on Sunday:

Michigan target Da'Shawn

major blow to the 2014 recruit-

on Thursday.
Hand, the No. 1 overall
recruit according to Rivals.com,
was leaning toward Michigan,
according to many experts.
When he committed to Alabama,
he bolstered the Crimson Tide's
No. 1 class and hurt Michigan's,
leaving the Wolverines with
four-star defensive lineman
Malik McDowell (Southfield,
Mich.) as their best remaining
defensive-line target.
The news wasn't all bad for
Michigan, though. Four recruits
- linebacker Michael Ferns,
quarterback Wilton Speight,
defensive back Brandon Watson
and wide receiver Freddy Can-
teen - signed their national let-
ters of intent last week, meaning
they can participate in spring
practice as early enrollees.
Only five 2014 recruits
remained in their teams' state
playoffs going into the weekend.

ESPN (128) Scout (NR)
Speight's playoff run ended
last week with a loss to Liberty
Christian in the state title game.
He completed 14 of 27 passes for
152 yards and four interceptions.
The yardage and interceptions
were his worst numbers of the
season. He did, however, throw
three touchdown passes for 56,
six and eight yards, accounting
for all of Collegiate's scoring.

yards and a touchdown in defeat.
Thomas Jefferson's season and
11-game winning streak ended in
the Western Pennsylvania Class
AAA semifinals.

Maurice Ways, wide receiver:
Country Day (Mich.) 28, Marine
City (Mich.) 33; Ranking: (NR)
Ways caught a 48-yard touch-
down pass in the second quar-

Michigan Division 4 quarter-
finals. Marine City scored the
game-winning touchdown pass
with 45 seconds left to eliminate
the Yellow Jackets.
Noah Furbush, linebacker:
Kenton (Ohio) 46, Triway (Ohio)
6; Ranking: (NR)
Furbush recovered a fumble
as Kenton advanced to the third
round of the Ohio Division IV S

bush was named the Western
Buckeye League's defensive
lineman of the year and won
first-team All-League honors.
His team, which has outscored
its opponents this season by a
combined score of 556-92, faces
a showdown against fellow
unbeaten Bryan (Ohio) on Fri-
day.
