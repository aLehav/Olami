Schlissel details new 
program available to 
students in Ypsilanti, 

Southfield schools

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The University will introduce 

a new program to increase racial 
and 
socioeconomic 
diversity 

among students by giving local 
high schoolers the chance to 
earn a full, four-year tuition 
scholarship, University President 
Mark Schlissel announced Friday 
morning.

Titled Wolverine Pathways, 

the new program will come at 
no cost to students. The first 
iteration of the program will 
choose 120 students — 60 seventh 
graders and 60 high schoolers 
— for Wolverine Pathways in 
January from the Southfield and 
Ypsilanti school districts.

Though the first round will 

select only students from those 
grade levels, the University aims 
to expand the program with each 
year, encompassing students in 

grades seven through 12.

“Inseparable 
from 
our 

efforts to enhance our academic 
excellence as a public good is our 
work to improve diversity, equity 
and inclusion at the University 
of Michigan,” Schlissel said at 
a breakfast for campus leaders. 
“We cannot be excellent without 
being diverse, in the broadest 
sense of that word.”

The students will work with 

tutors and mentors in math, 
English and science during eight-
week sessions in the fall, winter 
and summer. If these students 
successfully 
complete 
the 

program, apply and are admitted 
to the University, they will earn 
a scholarship covering all tuition 
fees for their 4 years.

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack’s Committee on Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion, led by 
Robert Sellers, vice provost for 
equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, 
devised 
Wolverine 

Pathways. The program provides 
many other resources for low 
income and minority students, 
such as leadership opportunities, 
cultural events, test preparation, 
visits to campus and resources for 

‘Leaders at their Best’ 
program to promote 
preventative mental 

health measures

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Prevention is key.
With 
that 
mindset, 
the 

University’s 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services is looking 
to reach a broader population of 
students.

This fall, CAPS is kicking off 

Leaders at their Best, an initiative 
that 
aims 
to 
wield 
positive 

psychology to reinforce students’ 
strengths and prevent mental 
health crises.

CAPS launched Leaders at their 

Best on Friday with a three-hour 
workshop in the Michigan Union. 
The event featured six stations, 
each one introducing a different 
element of positive psychology 
— creativity, mindful movement,

Freshman Warren 
scores two goals, 
Wolverines head 

home at 3-0-1

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

TROY, 
N.Y. 
— 
On 
Oct. 

11, 
Rensselaer 
Polytechnic 

Institute became a giant killer. 
Just three games into their 
season, the Engineers hosted 
then-No. 1 Boston College and 
sent the national powerhouse 
home with a 2-1 loss.

And as No. 11 Michigan 

entered RPI’s Houston Field 
House off the back of a near 
upset 
against 
Union, 
the 

Wolverines were in danger 
of suffering the same fate as 
the Eagles. After that Union 
matchup, 
Michigan 
center 

JT Compher made it clear 
that starting with less energy 
against RPI, or any team, was 
unacceptable 
— 
something 

the Wolverines clearly took to 
heart.

Just three minutes into the 

first period, freshman forward 
Brendan Warren received the 
puck in the slot from freshman 
center Cooper Marody and lit 
the lamp for his first collegiate 
goal to give Michigan a 1-0 lead.

After 
that 
goal, 
the 

Wolverines 
didn’t 
trail 
for 

the remainder of the game, 
defeating RPI, 5-2.

The 
rest 
of 
the 
frame 

remained scoreless, but the 
energy that Compher called for 
was evident nonetheless.

“We had a really good start 

today,” Warren said. “We were 
getting pucks deep, working 
down low and getting some 
pressure to the net. That’s 
something 
we 
didn’t 
do 

yesterday. We were kind of 
sitting back trying to play up 
high and be cute, and we were 
letting (Union) have chances. So 
we were on (RPI) today.”

Weekend festivities 
celebrate residence 
hall’s contributions 

to campus

By SARAH KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Current and former residents 

of the Martha Cook Building — 
one of the University’s all-female 
residence halls — gathered over 

the weekend to celebrate the 
residence hall’s 100th year.

The three-day anniversary 

celebration included a barbecue, 
organized dinner outings at 
various Ann Arbor restaurants 
and a gala dinner featuring 
remarks 
from 
University 

President Mark Schlissel, the 
weekend’s 
keynote 
speaker. 

The weekend concluded with a 
time capsule ceremony where 
attendees opened a time capsule 
from 1993 and created a new 
capsule to open in 2115. 

During 
his 
remarks 
at 

Saturday evening’s gala, Schlissel 
said the Martha Cook Building 
contributes to the culture of the 
University.

“I believe that every moment 

at the University represents a 
precious opportunity to learn,” 
he said. “The opportunity to 
learn outside the classroom is 
especially true of the Martha 
Cook Building. You have created 
a unique learning environment 
where everyone feels equally 
included. 
Throughout 
its 

impressive history, Martha Cook 
has been known for bringing 
together 
diverse 
group 
of 

women and is a cherished part 
of the University of Michigan 
community.”

Constructed in 1915 with 

funds from University alum 
William W. Cook, who named 
the building after his mother, 
Martha 
Cook 
is 
the

residence hall at the University

‘U’ plans N. Campus housing

M ANDAL A M E DITATION

James Lewis, vice presi-

dent 
for 
student 
affairs, 

announced the University 
would consult a large group of 
students concerning the early 
planning stages of a co-ed 
dormitory on North Campus.

The potential plans also 

included the construction of a 
fraternity and sorority “row,” 
along with 800 apartments 
designated for married stu-
dents.

Lewis was asked about an 

expected housing shortage 
for the following fall semes-
ter. He said the problem 
would be combatted by an 
“intense” campaign to house 
more students and Ann Arbor 
residents together. Lewis esti-

mated that 200 more students 
could be housed through such 
an initiative.

Thirty years ago this 
week (Oct. 28, 1985)

LSA’s 15-year-old policy 

of denying credit to ROTC 
students 
taking 
military 

education 
courses 
came 

under review by an LSA 
panel, with the proposal of 
rescinding the policy on the 
table.

According 
to 
Classical 

Studies Prof. Bruce Frier, a 
three-member subcommit-
tee established by the LSA 
Curriculum Committee was 
looking into every aspect of 

the policy, including the aca-
demic quality of courses.

LSA junior Jules Valley 

said it was unfair that LSA 
did not recognize these 
credits.

“The fact that the Engi-

neering School recogniz-
es those credits and LSA 
doesn’t is not very fair,” 
Valley said. “(ROTC) is very 
time consuming and I don’t 
get any credit for it.”

The policy against giv-

ing credit for ROTC courses 
was established in 1970, and 
had already withstood two 
attempts to reverse the deci-
sion in 1975 and 1979.

50 survivors attend Hillel 
Conference on the Holocaust

Organized by 

students, annual 
event draws more 
than 400 attendees

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 400 students 

gathered Friday at the fourth 
annual Michigan Sports Busi-
ness Conference to hear from 
several speakers prominent in 
the field.

Jaymee Messler, president 

of the sports media platform 
The Players’ Tribune, deliv-
ered the afternoon keynote 
address, in which she discussed 
her company’s unique take on 
sports media and gave advice 
for young women looking for 
careers in the sports industry.

Messler said the goal of her 

online publication is to give 
athletes the opportunity to tell 

their story in a way that they 
would not be able to with tra-
ditional media. Founded by for-
mer MLB player Derek Jeter, 
the site provides athletes the 
chance to directly tell their 
own stories through a variety 
of mediums, whether articles, 
videos or other formats.

“Each athlete is paired with 

an editor and if there’s some-
thing specific that the athlete 
wants to talk about, the editor 
will work with them to tran-
scribe their conversation,” she 
said.

Messler said this kind of 

relationship is built on trust.

“Because they know how 

that’s going to be, their guard 
is down and they’re a lot more 
open,” 
she 
said. 
“Nothing 

goes up without the athlete’s 
approval.”

Messler 
said 
people 
are 

beginning to see The Play-
ers’ Tribune as an alternative 
sports news site and not as a 
much as a direct competitor to 

traditional media.

“We do look at ourselves as 

a complement to the media, 
not in any way, shape or form 
a replacement,” she said. “Now 
that we’ve been around for a 
little while, it’s clear that we 
aren’t going to be a threat.”

Messler also gave advice 

to women aspiring to join the 
male-dominated field of exec-
utive-level sports management. 
She emphasized the impor-
tance of having confidence and 
looking to established women 
as mentors.

“I would just say, be proac-

tive, be confident, be yourself,” 
she said. “Think about what 
you’re passionate about and 
what experiences you want to 
have. Look for people like me in 
the industry and use them as a 
resource. Look for mentors.”

On the sports industry as 

a whole, Messler said she is 
pleased with the changes she 
has seen in regard to opportu-
nities for women.

“One thing that I’m very 

happy to see is that there are a 
lot more jobs and opportunities 
available for women today then 
when I first started getting into 
this industry,” she said.

Business sophomore Jenn 

Smith said she appreciated 
hearing from a woman in power 
within the sports industry.

“I thought it was really help-

ful just to see a woman in a 
powerful position speaking to 
us,” she said. “In the Business 
School you don’t get to see a 
lot of women that are in those 
positions that you can actually 
talk to and look up to.”

Gerry Kraus, a Holocaust survivor from Berlin, discusses his experiences in Nazi Germany with students at the annual 
Conference on the Holocaust Luncheon held at Hillel on Sunday.

Attendees tell 
World War II 
stories at 9th 
annual meeting 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 50 Holocaust 

survivors from Metro Detroit 
convened at Hillel on Sunday 
to share their experiences with 
students during the ninth annu-
al Conference on the Holocaust.

The room held roughly 30 

numbered tables, with one or 
two survivors seated at each. 
Attendees 
were 
encouraged 

to move from table to table, 
hearing accounts from those 
who were displaced from their 
homes during World War II.

Tilly 
Shames, 
executive 

director of Hillel, said descen-
dants of Holocaust survivors 
have a responsibility to learn 
about their journeys and inform 

future generations.

“We’re at a time where we 

will not have many years left 
with Holocaust survivors who 
can 
share 
their 
first-hand 

accounts of their lives in East-
ern Europe before, during, and 
after the Holocaust,” she said.

LSA sophomore Gabby Roth, 

co-president of COTH, said her 
involvement with the organiza-
tion was influenced by her late 
grandfather, a Holocaust survi-
vor from Czechoslovakia who 
made a priority of preserving 
his memories for future genera-
tions.

“It was really important to 

me to do something on campus 
that honored his legacy,” Roth 
said. “It’s definitely a big part of 
my identity, and I wanted to get 
involved in something that edu-
cated people on campus about 
the Holocaust.”

Roth said it has become 

increasingly difficult for COTH 
to contact the same volume of 
survivors, as many pass away 
each year.

“From last year to this year 

it was much harder to get sur-
vivors to come,” Roth said. “It’s 
really unfortunate, but it’s the 
last few years that survivors are 
around to tell their stories.”

Roth said students are eager 

to hear survivors recount their 
histories, but often find it diffi-
cult when probing for details.

“The survivors, that’s what 

they want to do, they want to 
answer these questions, they 
want to educate people,” Roth 
said. 

Business senior Ariel Berger, 

co-president of COTH, said the 
organization began with the 
goal of keeping Holocaust mem-
ories alive.

“As students, we are present-

ed with the incredible oppor-
tunity of being able to hear 
first-hand the stories of these 
survivors and their unimagi-
nable hardships as well as their 
triumphs,” Berger said.

The 
launch 
of 
Wolverine 

Pathways follows the enrollment 
of the most racially diverse 
freshman 
class 
since 
2005. 

Underrepresented 
minority 

students represent 12.8 percent 
this fall’s incoming class, a 
2.8-percent increase from last 
year’s incoming class.

In 
2005, 
underrepresented 

minorities made up 13.8 percent 
of the entering class. However, 
representation 
of 
minority 

students slowly declined following 
the statewide ballot proposal 
Proposal 2, which banned the use 
of race-based affirmative action 

in public entities.

Schlissel 
thanked 
Kedra 

Ihsop, associate vice president 
for enrollment management, and 
her team for working to enroll a 
more diverse student body within 
the confines of the law. He noted 
Ishop made significant changes 
to financial aid, recruitment and 
admission policies during his first 
year at the helm of the University.

“I want to thank the many 

individuals who have worked very 
hard to achieve these gains in a 
relatively short time,” Schlissel 
said.

The University also launched 

a new website detailing their 
diversity 
efforts: 
diversity.

umich.edu. The website provides 
resources for students, as well 
as provides a space for online 

discussions regarding issues of 
inclusion.

For 
more 
discussion 
on 

diversity 
within 
campus, 

Schlissel is hosting a campus-
wide diversity summit open to 
all members of the community on 
Nov. 10.

Last 
February, 
Schlissel 

launched a Strategic Plan for 
Diversity 
to 
improve 
equity 

and inclusion on campus. He 
appointed 60 facilitators within 
each college and campus unit to 
collaborate with faculty, staff 
and students to outline diversity 
efforts unique to their unit.

At the breakfast, Schlissel said 

these individual unit plans are 
due by the end of the academic 
school year. 

alums started the association 
in 1918. The dorm’s alumni 
association assists in awarding 
scholarships to current residents 
and 
organizes 
fundraising 

efforts and events like the 100th 
anniversary.

Sheila 
Davis, 
the 
100th 

anniversary general chair who 
organized the event, said the 
activities allowed alumni to 
reconnect and meet the current 
generation of women living in 
the building.

Davis said the anniversary 

serves as an important milestone 
for the Martha Cook Building 

and its history of forming lasting 
bonds and friendships.

“Cookies” past and present 

bonded over their experiences in 
the dorm, including University 
alum 
Beth 
Johnston, 
who 

said living there helped her 
form lasting friendships that 
have continued through her 
involvement 
in 
the

“Everyone from freshman to 

graduate students living there, 
you really have a diverse group 
of women to draw experience 
from,” she said. “I remember 
sitting at dinner and having a 
problem and talking to a grad 
student who put things in 
perspective and evoked wisdom. 
It felt like I had just talked to an 

older sister who set me straight. 
You don’t get that at a normal 
dorm or at an apartment.”

Ramseyer has lived in the

during her last year on campus. 

“This event means so much 

to me that I am able to be here

anniversary. 
The 
fact 
that 

so many other Cookies have

and 
self-compassion. 
Positive 

psychology 
employs 
these 

techniques, among others, to cope 
with anxiety and increase quality 
of life.

Christine 
Asidao, 
CAPS 

associate director of community 
engagement and outreach, said 
the goal is to reach students with 
a wide variety of mental health 
concerns.

“Leaders at their Best is really 

about 
increasing 
resiliency, 

wellness and wellbeing across the 
U of M campus and specifically 
focused on our students,” she said. 
“We see students who are coming 
in in a lot of distress, and we want 
to help those students, but we also 
want to help those students who 
might also be doing pretty well 
but just sometimes forget because 
finals are coming up, things are 
getting really busy, time seems to 
be going really quickly.”

Over the next several weeks, 

CAPS will host a series of 
workshops 
dedicated 
to 
the 

various 
elements 
of 
positive 

psychology.

“If you can highlight what 

people’s 
strengths 
are, 
have 

people really be attuned to what’s 
going on in the moment, say 
through mindfulness, it can really 
improve a person’s overall sense of 
wellbeing,” Asidao said.

At a meeting last spring, Asidao 

initiated a conversation about 
positive psychology with CAPS’s 
community outreach group. From 
that discussion, Leaders at their 
Best was born.

LSA senior Micalah Webster, 

a member of the CAPS student 
advisory 
board, 
said 
part 

of the initiative’s goal is to 
teach students skills they can 
implement in their daily lives.

“Things that people could 

really learn, skills they could 
walk away with and that they 
could keep doing afterwards, 
something that could just get 
people excited and have a really 
nice break.”

Asidao said student feedback 

from events held over the next few 
weeks will determine what is next 
for the initiative. According to her, 
feedback from various student 
groups has been positive thus far.

Webster, 
an 
organizational 

studies major, said one of her 
classes is conducting a research 
project that will measure the 
efficacy of the Leaders at their 
Best 
campaign. 
The 
project 

began by sending out a pre-
survey asking students what 
forms of positive psychology they 
already practice. This survey, 
which roughly 300 students 
responded to, will be used as a 
baseline. After the preliminary 
group of Leaders at their Best 
events conclude, the class plans 
to follow up with students from 
the pre-survey to see how their 
positive 
psychology 
practices 

have changed.

“We’re really just looking at 

how this all is functioning just so 
in the future we can make sure 
that we’re constantly putting 
forth the best and most effective 
campaigns that are evidence-
based,” she said.

Asidao is hoping the initiative 

has an impact on students’ daily 
lives. She said prevention is an 
element of student mental health 
that often falls by the wayside on 
college campuses. By promoting 
preventative techniques, CAPS is 
hoping to address mental health 
issues before they become crises.

“To 
really 
think 
about 

prevention as an actual way of 
intervening with our students is 
a big deal,” Asidao said. “What 
we’re trying to do is give tools to 
students before problems get too 
big.”

addresses to the summit Saturday. 
O’Malley is currently polling 
below 1 percent in the Democratic 
contest.

O’Malley noted several times 

in his speech that Islamophobia 
and xenophobia are rampant 
in the United States today, and 
said he understands it can be 
discouraging to be an Arab 
American 
or 
an 
American 

Muslim.

“At the Republican debate, 

Donald Trump said it wasn’t fair 
that he didn’t know the names 
of terrorist leaders because, he 
said: they all have Arab names,” 
O’Malley 
said. 
“Ben 
Carson 

flat out said he would not be 
comfortable with a president 
who happened to be Muslim. 
One 
wonders, 
from 
a 
man 

who understands the value of 
education, what sort of message 
that sends to Muslim American 
little boys and girls studying 
American history.”

He acknowledged the threat 

terrorist groups in the Middle 
East, such as the Islamic State, 
present to the United States, but 
cautioned that fear should not 
prevent Americans from being 
open or inclusive.

“There are other ways to lead 

then at the end of a drone strike,” 
he said. “And in the face of this 
humanitarian crisis, we need to 
step up … The image of our nation 
is not a barbed wire fence, it is the 
Statue of Liberty.”

O’Malley went on to say that 

America’s role of world leadership 
should be one of morality and 
compassion, 
referencing 
the 

estimated 9 million refugees who 
have fled Syria since a civil war 
began in the country in 2011.

The question of who has 

responsibility 
for 
taking 
in 

the 
refugees 
has 
prompted 

international debate in recent 
months 
as 
the 
number 
of 

immigrants has increased, with 
many European countries split 
on how many refugees they are 
willing to accept. The U.S. has 
so far taken a background role, 
accepting 1,500 refugees, though 
the White House announced in 
September plans to accept 10,000 
more.

O’Malley has been vocal in his 

commitment to provide American 
support to refugees, and was 
the first candidate to respond 
affirmatively to a request from the 
International Rescue Committee 
to the U.S. government to accept 
at least 65,000 Syrian refugees 
by 
2016. 
GOP 
presidential 

candidate Donald Trump has 
also announced support for the 
request.

“If Germany, a country with 

one-fourth our population, can 
accept 800,000 refugees this 
year, another half million in 
subsequent years, surely we can 
accept 65,000,” O’Malley said.

Before 
O’Malley’s 
speech, 

three recent immigrants to the 
United 
States 
addressed 
the 

crowd about the hardships they 
faced leaving the Middle East 
for the United States to provide 
their children with safer lives and 
more opportunities.

O’Malley spoke with them 

in a session also open to press 
to discuss improvements to the 
American immigration process.

Troy 
resident 
Noor 
Al 

Dabbagh, who arrived in January 
2014 from Iraq with her husband 
and son, told O’Malley about her 
and her husband’s long wait to 
receive a work authorization, 
which, she said, was particularly 
challenging because the money 

they had saved was running out.

Because her family had yet 

to receive asylum status, she 
said, they did not qualify for any 
government assistance for the 
unemployed or medical insurance 
to cover the costs of living.

Dearborn 
Heights 
resident 

Radhia Fakhrildeen spoke of 
leaving a prosperous life in Iraq 
behind to come to the United 
States in January 2014 with her 
children. She told O’Malley it 
has been particularly difficult 
to establish a life for her family 
in the United States because 
she has not been able to find a 
job and because her husband’s 
application to join her was 
denied.

In response to the immigrants’ 

stories, 
O’Malley 
said 
the 

immigration system must be 
modernized and families should 
not be broken up. He told media 
that there needs to be a new and 
better approach to balancing 
security 
concerns 
with 
the 

lengthy screening process that 
currently exists for individuals 
seeking entrance to the United 
States.

“I don’t believe that we should 

shortchange the background and 
the security checks, but I believe 
we have to act like lives depend on 
our being able to improve these 
processes and do a much better 
job of it quickly without cutting 
corners,” he said.

Speaking 
to 
reporters, 
he 

said the past of every American 
contains a story or an experience 
that could help them empathize 
with Syrian refugees.

“Our people were all once 

immigrant people, and that is 
the beauty of the United States 
of America,” he said. “With the 
exception of Native Americans, 
we were all once strangers in a 
strange land.”

Participants begin the Purple Run 5K outside of Pierpont Commons on Saturday. Proceeds from the event were 
donated to the SafeHouse Center, a local organization that helps survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. 
DPSS hosts first annual 
SafeHouse 5K fundraiser 

North Campus 
event promotes 
domestic violence 

awareness

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Early 
Saturday 
morning, 

about 250 people lined up 
outside Pierpont Commons to 
participate in the first annual 
Purple 
Run 
5K 
run/walk 

held by the the University’s 
Division 
of 
Public 
Safety 

and Security in conjunction 
with the Washtenaw County 
Prosecutor’s Office. 

The goal of the run was to 

raise awareness for domestic 
violence 
and 
to 
fundraise 

for 
the 
SafeHouse 
Center. 

Entertainment for the event 
was provided by Soultivity, a 
band of local attorneys from 
Ann Arbor.

Brian 
Mackie, 
the 

prosecuting 
attorney 
of 

Washtenaw County since 1993, 
kicked off the event. 

“When you leave you should 

tell everyone what you did,” 

he said. “You are champions 
of justice for running this 
today. 
More 
than 
1,000 

domestic violence cases a year, 
and that it is one of the most 
underreported crimes means 
that it’s the tip of the iceberg. 
We can’t tolerate that level of 
violence and misery that has to 
change.”

After 
opening 
statements 

by Mackie and Barbara Niess-
May, 
executive 
director 
of 

SafeHouse, 
the 
race 
was 

started by Arnett Chisholm, 
dean of admissions and student 
life at Washtenaw Community 
College and assistant track 
coach at the University. 

The loop was centralized on 

North Campus, and runners 
and walkers alike went about 
it at their own pace. The first 
finisher 
was 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Charlie 
Castelli, 

who had a self-timed 18:27 
finish. 

The 
time 
it 
took 
for 

participants 
to 
complete 

their route, however, was not 
the main focus of the day. 
According 
to 
DPSS, 
every 

60 seconds, 20 people are 
victims of intimate violence. In 
addition, every year, an average 

of 54 officers are killed in the 
line of duty responding to 
domestic violence calls.

During the event, Niess-May 

advocated for the resources 
that SafeHouse provides. 

“We support survivors of 

sexual assault and domestic 
violence by putting qualified 
trained counselors in front of 
people in crisis, and need help 
for what’s going on in their 
life. We also offer shelter, 
support groups, legal advocacy, 
(personal 
protection 
order) 

assistance, 
some 
limited 

financial assistance.” 

The event drew numerous 

University 
participants 

including first-year Medical 
student Jennifer Neva. 

“I am a big fan of SafeHouse 

and the work they do for 
the community,” said Neva. 
“In medicine we often think 
that health issues related to 
domestic violence don’t get the 
attention they deserve, so this 
is a really good way for people 
to learn about these issues and 
help support the cause.” 

The organizers plan to make 

the Purple Run an annual event, 
and hope for more people to get 
involved in the cause.

I 

n the past decade, the American public and 
the world at large have been exposed to a 
problem — the rising prison population in 

the United States. People 
know American prison facts 
so well they can probably 
recite them in their sleep: 
America holds roughly five 
percent of the world’s peo-
ple, but 25 percent of the 
world’s prison population. 
Between 30 and 41 per-
cent of juveniles have been 
arrested by the time they’re 
23. Over the last 30 years, 
our prison population has 
increased more than 400 
percent. Many prisoners are 
ineligible for student loans, public housing and 
food stamps, and are isolated from support sys-
tems after doing their time. 

The Black Lives Matter movement, which 

has increased news coverage of killed or incar-
cerated young black males, and the popular-
ized “The New Jim Crow” book by Michelle 
Alexander, have led people to believe that the 
problem of mass incarceration lies in the impris-
onment of too many nonviolent drug offenders. 
The solution, therefore, seems obvious: Release 
nonviolent offenders and provide less punitive, 
more rehabilitative options. That feels good in 
theory — a simple solution for a simple prob-
lem. Unfortunately, that formula seldom applies 
 

to life.

While we should reverse extreme policies 

hindering this population, solving the prob-
lems regarding nonviolent drug offenders will 
not solve problems in America’s criminal jus-
tice system. Why? They don’t make up that 
many offenders. That is, 90 percent of general 
offenders are in state institutions, and 17 per-
cent are there for drug-related crimes, meaning 
that if we were to release all nonviolent offend-
ers, it would decrease the prison population by 
approximately 300,000. That’s significant, but 
will not combat the larger issue. Additionally, 
while it is true that close to 44 percent of feder-
al prisoners are locked up for drug crimes, fed-
eral prisoners make up a small portion (about 
216,300 as of 2014) of our prison population. 

Fortunately, within this context, drug laws 

have become increasingly lenient. From 2009 
to 2013, drug laws were made more forgiving 
in 40 states. Due to the high expenses of hous-
ing inmates, increasing use of drug courts and 
decriminalization of marijuana, our perspec-
tive on drug use and treatment has shifted; the 
nation has moved away from punishment and 
toward rehabilitation. As a result, the well-
known (and smaller) issue of harsh drug poli-
cies has become somewhat resolved.

And yet, even beyond the understanding of 

nonviolent drug offenders, there are more mis-
conceptions about problems plaguing our crim-
inal justice system. Specifically, private prisons 
and mandatory minimums.

It’s commonly believed that private prisons 

are deplorable institutions, set to exploit prison-
ers and imprison as many people as possible. Yet, 
according to the ACLU, private prisons contain 
just 6 percent of state prisoners and 16 percent 
of federal prisoners. Although these institutions 

are incentivized to imprison more people, they 
were created as a response to mass incarceration, 
not as instigators of the issue. They’re not the 
 

main concern.

Additionally, mandatory minimums are seen 

as unjust structures that have wildly increased 
prison populations. However, prisoners have 
not served much more time due to these sen-
tences. According to David Brooks, “Roughly 
half of all prisoners have prison terms in the 
range of two to three years, and only 10 percent 
serve more than seven years.” To be sure, man-
datory minimums are not “good.” But, again, 
they are not the main driver of mass incarcera-
tion in this country.

Clearly, though, there are problems in our 

criminal justice system; we don’t have the larg-
est prison population for nothing. It seems 
that the answer lies in our prosecutors. From 
the 1990s to the mid-2000s, district attorneys 
became more aggressive with their felony 
charges, ultimately imprisoning people for lon-
ger periods — increasing imprisonment even 
while the number of arrests was decreasing.

The reason these persons delivered harsh 

sentences is murky, possibly due to tough-
on-crime policies, the war on drugs and 
 

political motivators.

Ultimately, though, these actions were likely 

propagated by the belief that criminals are bad 
people, not people having done badly in a difficult 
situation. Maybe if we change how we see them, 
not as callous, manipulative or insane individu-
als, but rather as humans who falter and make 
mistakes based on their lives’ contexts, we will 
avoid unfairly harsh penalties.

Now, you may be asking, if we are to shape 

our perspectives, does that mean that everyone 
should be let go? Should there be no punish-
ment for the crime? Of course not. However, 
we need to suggest proper restitution, thereby 
allowing perpetrators to right their wrongs: 
apologize, rehabilitate themselves and pay it 
forward to the community of which they’ve 
damaged. Provide them autonomy by giving 
them a purpose and the opportunity to aug-
ment something else — specifically if it can help 
their victims (or victims’ family).

Two New York-based programs embody this 

sentiment: the Bard Prison Initiative and Work 
For Success program. The former allows pris-
oners to earn a college degree while the latter 
provides them opportunities to work after being 
released. Each helps reduce recidivism rates, 
expand the economy and instill hope in people 
who were formerly lost in the system.

In order to implement these kinds of programs, 

we must believe that troubled people can restore 
justice. We should allow people the opportunity 
to alter the way they see themselves and their 
world, and contribute positively (directly or indi-
rectly) to those they’ve harmed. Truly, that’s the 
beauty of human nature within our society — 
we can advance ourselves and avoid a zero-sum 
game, with a definite loser and winner. That is, 
our capacity for improvement can make every-
one in our world better off. Whether it’s reform, 
rehabilitation or introspection more broadly, our 
malleability allows for limitless possibilities.

L

ast week, I sat through a 
women’s studies lecture on 
body image. Thanks to the 

comprehensive 
health 
educa-

tion I received 
throughout 
middle and high 
school, 
I 
was 

already familiar 
with most of the 
material. I knew 
anorexia’s 
tell-

tale signs, and I 
understand that 
binge eating is 
considered 
an 

eating disorder alongside bulimia. 
Body Mass Index is a misguided way 
to measure if someone is a healthy 
weight or not, and dieting almost 
never, ever produces sustainable, 
long-term weight loss.

I’ll admit that it wasn’t until we 

arrived on the PowerPoint slide 
about objectification that I sat up in 
my chair and started to actively lis-
ten. I already knew what objectifica-
tion was — when society views the 
female body as an object, as opposed 
to a whole being that’s lived in and 
experienced — and I knew that it’s 
definitely not a good thing. Objecti-
fication is dangerous for a whole host 
of reasons: It lowers women’s self-
esteem and makes us believe that our 
value is tied to our physicality, some-
times leading us to eating disorders 
as a desperate attempt to maintain a 
“desirable” figure. When women are 
reduced to objects, violence against 
us is internalized as normal, and 
both men and women dehumanize 
us and see us as less competent.

But this isn’t even the worst part. 

For me, the most disturbing trend 
stemming from objectification is 
when women turn this practice onto 
themselves. Some women tend to 
objectify their own bodies by inter-
nalizing a third-person’s perspec-
tive of themselves, something that, 
according to a survey published in 
Psychology of Women Quarterly, 
leads to decreased cognitive perfor-
mance, increased feelings of shame 
and anxiety, and restrained eating. 
Just like advertisements that grue-

somely dismember a woman’s body 
to isolate sexualized parts, we some-
times look in mirrors and chop our-
selves up, too, falling victim to the 
notion that our body is not a holis-
tic experience, but merely a col-
lection of things — legs, bust, torso 
— that can each be isolated and, in 
 

turn, scrutinized. 

This is the element of objectifi-

cation that quite literally took my 
breath away, but not because it was 
surprising. Like most of the lecture 
material, I was already familiar with 
objectification theory. I had learned 
about it in my middle school health 
courses when I was 13, and although 
I understood its pervasive and dam-
aging effects at the time, I remem-
ber that I never really wrapped my 
head around it. In eighth grade, I 
had yet to truly experience body 
surveillance and shaming. At the 
risk of sounding obnoxious, at 13, I 
didn’t have a single reason to be self-
conscious of my body. I had grown 
up athletic, pretty, confident and so 
outspoken I verged on loudmouth. 
Because I wasn’t embarrassed of my 
body in the slightest bit, the notion 
of systematically and relentlessly 
surveying my figure for flaws was so 
far from reality. I easily dismissed 
self-objectificationn as inapplicable. 
So when the bell rang on the last day 
of school in June 2008, I didn’t think 
critically about self-objectification 
and wouldn’t until it eventually 
became my own reality.

Fast forward to Wednesday of last 

week. I’m 21 now, and am hyper-
aware and self-conscious of my looks. 
I didn’t realize how often I self-objec-
tified until my professor forced me to 
face it head-on with two simple ques-
tions. First, how often do you look in 
a mirror? As she counted upwards, 1, 
2, 3 … to as many times as you walk 
by anything reflective, I kept my 
hand raised. Second, when you look 
in the mirror, what are you looking 
for? Are you seeing if your hair or 
makeup is in place, or are you focus-
ing in on a part of your body? My face 
burned. I felt so embarrassed. I felt 
 

so superficial.

It was like my professor was read-

ing my mind. Every morning when I 

get up, I stand in front of my mirror 
and look at my stomach. It’s my least 
favorite part of my body, and I vigi-
lantly watch it to see if it looks bloat-
ed. I’ll lift up my shirt and look at it, 
then stand sideways and see how 
much it sticks out. I’ll search care-
fully to see if that late-night piece of 
pizza settled anywhere on my hips. 
Isolating my stomach is part of my 
morning routine, and it’s a textbook 
example of self-objectifying.

I can’t wholly blame “society” for 

relentlessly pressuring me to look 
a certain way, and the source of my 
body image issues is more compli-
cated than glossy magazines that 
equate beautiful to thin. Everyday, 
I internalize conflicting signals tell-
ing me to both love my body, but at 
the same time constantly work to 
improve it. That I should adore the 
skin I’m in, but to make sure that skin 
is waxed, clear and made desirable 
with a host of products. When I look 
at my stomach, part of me is admir-
ing my curves, while the other part is 
desperately ensuring that they never, 
ever soften with time (or pizza). 
Although my mirror survey could 
be seen as partially congratulatory, 
treating my body as something that 
must maintained to look a specific 
way is degrading, and now, at 21, I 
finally get it. If eighth-grade Annie 
could see me in the morning in front 
of my mirror, she’d probably shove 
me, tell me to knock it off and to quit 
being so vain.

My surveillance is not healthy, 

and it took last Wednesday’s lecture 
to realize that it’s more than just a 
dumb habit — it’s detrimental to my 
overall self-worth and confidence. I 
must work harder to view my body 
not as a collection of parts, but as a 
whole, spiritual being that can com-
bat the onslaught of messages telling 
me my worth is measured in pounds 
and inches. Last Wednesday’s lec-
ture made me realize that I was 
more confident at 13 with braces and 
zits than I am today, and frankly, 
that’s just backwards. It’s about time 
I change that.

Struggling with self-objectification

T

he polarization of America’s 
political parties might be 
brainwashing us all. Hillary 

Clinton’s 11-hour 
testimony before 
the House Select 
Committee 
on 

Benghazi hearing 
put the former 
Secretary of State 
and 
Democratic 

presidential 
candidate 
at 

the 
mercy 
of 

interrogative 
congressional 
representatives. 
And for nearly 
every minute, a bitter battle between 
the two sides of the aisle waged on.

Like Bernie Sanders, U.S. Rep. 

Elijah 
Cummings 
(D–Md.), 
a 

member of the committee, has 
had enough with the e-mails. He 
concluded, “It is time now for 
Republicans to end this taxpayer-
funded fishing expedition.”

Meanwhile, Republican members 

of 
the 
committee 
maintained 

the full-court press on Clinton 
along with stern looks and an icy 
indifference to humor.

The conservative base continues 

to exist in its own subset of reality 
regarding Benghazi. Now many of 
the major news outlets agree, none 
of the investigations drummed up 
anything significant about Clinton. 
But this does not include Fox News 
(sigh), which continues to label 
Clinton a liar. 

The 
partisan 
tension 
is 
so 

tangible now that CNN reports the 
hearing “is unlikely to have changed 
any minds.” We’ve survived the 
Benghazi round unswayed, so until 
another event causes controversy, 
the two parties have been called 
back to their corners in what 
is ultimately the fight for the 
 

2016 presidency.

Listening to Cummings during 

the Benghazi hearing, he spoke 
with an impassioned voice and 
appeared to be emotionally stirred 
during parts of Clinton’s testimony. 
Meanwhile 
the 
Republican 

congressmen were cold and stern, 
like Bond villains. 

But I’m a liberal. To see it that 

way, am I conforming to the rules 
of partisanship? I struggle to 
determine whether I’m judging 
conservatives by what they say 
on the record or my preconceived 

ideas about them. By stepping 
into the shoes of a conservative 
sympathizer, it’s easy to buy their 
argument. 
They’re 
steadfast, 

serious and seem to hold their 
beliefs loyally. To each party, 
the other one seems to be made 
of buffoons and cheats, leaving 
middle-of-the-road-Americans 
with a difficult choice to make.

Political beliefs are influenced by 

other values. Conflicting principles 
lead to political debates where no 
solution is possible because both 
arguments make sense. Thanks to 
the two-party system, American 
voters are pressured into voting one 
way, and choosing a candidate based 
upon shared beliefs. 

But what if that same candidate 

also pushes for initiatives that 
would work against the voters’ 
self-interest? It’s hard to imagine a 
tougher political position than being 
something like a devout Christian 
living in poverty, a voter who watches 
the GOP simultaneously champion 
religious beliefs and rail against most 
social programs.

Seemingly 
major 
political 

distinctions like these are glossed 
over by the two-party system of 
politics, and voters don’t know how 
to vote in their own self-interest 
rather than for the politician who 
best resonates with the party. 
Calling 
someone 
a 
Republican 

or Democrat means as much as 
anything they could say in their 
own defense.

Titles resonate with the public 

more than a substantive debate 
about the issues (unless you’re 
Bernie Sanders). Americans seem 
to spend little time thinking about 
their own beliefs. I call this the 
“Shut-up-and-take-my-money” 
theory of voting.

The quickest way to identify a 

conservative extremist is to find the 
person who hates Democrats, and 
vice versa. When loathing for the 
enemy is a prerequisite, any move 
to compromise can cost you your 
livelihood. Just ask John Boehner.

The stalemate that couldn’t be 

ended by an 11-hour hearing in the 
House of Representatives will face 
one of two possible outcomes. First, 
the deep chasm that divides the two 
parties could remain unbridgeable 
until Election Day, and we can 
publicly look forward to 12 more 
months of dogmatic spitfire until the 
next president is decided.

Or, anyone intending to vote 

should take a deep introspective 
look at their own values and 
analyze their roots. This is the more 
hopeful, albeit much less likely, 
way to cut down the confusion and 
noise of the partisan divide on an 
individual 
standpoint. 
Whether 

it’s legalization of marijuana, an 
increased minimum wage or a 
white-hot 
military 
response 
in 

Syria, each unique belief has its own 
nuanced set of motives and values 
that we often fail to analyze within 
ourselves or our candidates.

The outcome of the election 

is the prize. At the moment the 
next president is announced, both 
parties get to see how well their 
campaigning strategies paid off and 
how many of the undecided they 
could lift up onto the bandwagon. 
After all, a CEO doesn’t need 
to be persuaded to vote for tax 
cuts. Whichever party claims the 
presidency will shuffle the deck — 
the game of politics will start anew 
and the Benghazi hearing will 
become a distant memory.

Society 
is 
so 
accepting 
of 

authority 
that 
it 
has 
allowed 

marketing firms and microphones 
to hijack our political system. The 
parties and their supporters tell us 
what to believe. It is easy to trust 
a voice on the radio, or someone 
giving a lecture, because they speak 
with some authority. Yet the system 
works best for individuals who 
choose candidates that conform 
to their own beliefs and fight the 
social obsession with joining one of 
the two existing clubs.

We can go through debates and 

hearings until the C-Span satellite 
crashes to earth, but the voice each 
voter should be concerned with the 
most is their own. Holding a free-
form debate with the mirror should 
be higher up on everyone’s agenda 
in order to to establish a set of 
personal beliefs, and make it harder 
for political ad-men to buy and sell 
voters to big-politics.

The 
broad 
scope 
of 
two-

party politics is too unspecific. It 
compromises 
individual 
values 

for conventional wisdom. Joining 
under either party’s flag with no self-
awareness groups members into a 
faceless mass to be directed onward, 
and is a willing loss of liberty.

FILM REVIEW
‘Kasbah’ hindered

Bill Murray 

blunders through 

the Middle East and 
a middling comedy

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Richie Lanz (Bill Murray, 

“Groundhog Day”) is a washed-
up music manager who is still 
searching for 
the 
success-

ful 
act 
that 

will 
solidify 

his 
place 
in 

history. 
But, 

much 
like 

Lanz, 
“Rock 

the 
Kasbah” 

strives 
for 

greatness with 
such 
fervor 

that it misses 
the opportunity to at least tell a 
somewhat decent story. With a 
jumble of serious to superficial 
focuses and underdeveloped 
characters, the film stumbles 
on its way to success.

Jumping from situational 

comedy to action film to heart-
felt drama, “Rock the Kasbah” 
is never able to gain momen-
tum on the genre rollercoaster 
it pulls its audience through. 
After his unstable rock star 
client, Ronnie (Zooey Descha-
nel, “500 Days of Summer”), 
abandons him in Kabul at the 
beginning of their haphazard 
USO tour, Lanz must find a way 
back to the U.S. without money, 
a passport or any clue of what 
he’s going to do next. After a 
drawn-out 
journey 
through 

the war-torn city — where he 
meets the mystical call girl 
Merci (Kate Hudson, “How to 
Lose a Guy in 10 Days”) and 

gets wrapped up in an ammo 
exchange between American 
trader Bombay Brian (Bruce 
Willis, “Die Hard”) and a local 
village — Richie finds purpose 
when he meets a young Pash-
tun girl who dreams of being a 
famous singer. Fighting against 
the girl’s family, the producers 
from the singing show “Afghan 
Star,” and the country’s tradi-
tional culture, he manages to 
find her national recognition 
when she is given the opportu-
nity to perform on national TV.

While the plot seems fan-

tastical enough to produce an 
engrossing film, its quick shuf-
fle through thin characters 
leaves the audience unsure and 
unattached by the end. Lanz and 
Ronnie have barely had a few 
minutes of screentime before the 
central plot point of an Afghani-
stan USO tour is introduced, and 
it’s difficult to stay investment 
when things begin to go haywire 
in Kabul. Ronnie is gone with-
in the first half hour, and the 
absence of her character adds 
a sense of distrust to the rest of 
the film’s introductions. Addi-
tionally, there’s a strange sense 
that all actors involved are play-
ing a slightly altered version of 
themselves, with Deschanel as 
the unstable waif, Murray as the 
unsatisfied witness and Hud-
son as the enigmatic seductress, 
attempting to reprise her role as 
a mysterious groupie in “Almost 
Famous.” The story comes sole-
ly from placing these already 
known characterizations in a 
completely unknown and unpre-
dictable setting. While this 
story-building strategy tends to 
succeed in some films, in “Kas-
bah,” it only serves to cheapen 
an already jumbled plot.

The 
strange 
taste 
these 

characterizations leave is only 
intensified through the juxta-

position between the war-torn 
Middle East and colorfully 
mindless rock star characters 
through whom we see the set-
ting. There’s something uncom-
fortable about Lanz deciding 
its worth risking a young Pash-
tun girl’s life because he believes 
she is talented, or watching him 
walk through the streets, dishev-
eled in a paisley shirt and rose 
glasses, while children run after 
him asking for money or treats. 
While the characters are not 
completely unaffected by the 
situation — Ronnie skips town as 
soon as possible, Richie screams 
for minutes in disoriented terror 
after his car drives over an IED 
— these moments are approached 
with a comedic jab that suggests 
we should recognize these inci-
dents as play.

The film’s only redeeming 

factor comes from its images. 
Morally, it’s strange to look 
at Ronnie and Lanz walking 
bedraggled through the rubble 
and smoke-filled streets in 
metallic 
bell 
bottoms 
and 

velvet jackets, visually it’s a 
vibrant and extremely rock 
‘n’ roll picture. They drive a 
vintage yellow taxi through 
endless desert hills, and Merci’s 
illuminated, multicolor trailer 
sits behind countless loops of 
barbed wire on an empty street. 
The mise en scene presents a 
tension that continues through 
the story — if only this story 
was strong enough to justify the 
dynamic images that compose 
the film.

Following a group of pseudo 

rock stars through the Middle 
East sounds like a colorful 
thrill 
ride, 
but 
with 
flat 

characters leading us along a 
confusing 
and 
unmotivated 

plot, “Rock the Kasbah” edges 
past exciting and into the 
realm of pointless exploration.

FILM NOTEBOOK
My ‘Rocky’ first time

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Before Friday night, the clos-

est I’d come to the spectacle that 
is “Rocky Horror Picture Show” 
was a Halloween special of “Glee” 
that centered on PG-13 covers of 
the movie’s hit songs, and that 
one scene in “The Perks of Being a 
Wallflower” where Emma Watson 
dances on stage in black lingerie to 
the horror and delight of a young, 
naïve Logan Lerman. 

Neither one of those experi-

ences could prepare me for the real 
thing, and that became quite clear 
when I started doing some prepa-
ratory research. After the fourth 
fan forum page, I started to get 
nervous. Was I expected to dress 
up? Should I buy props? Will peo-
ple know that I’m a “Rocky Hor-
ror” virgin? After much debate and 
Googling, I settled on an all black 
ensemble, mostly because corsets 
are expensive, and it was cold out-
side (and if I didn’t blend into the 
crowd I could at least blend into a 
dark corner). 

The time finally came, and I 

arrived at the State Theater to find 
it more crowded than I’ve ever 
seen it before. I guess this brings 
out a different crowd than Tuesday 
night screenings of indie dram-
edies. Some people are wearing 
jeans and I let out an audible sigh 
of relief, but there’s also a good per-
centage of the crowd in full drag. 
Chest hair and lingerie seems to be 
the uniform of choice. I don’t make 
it up the stairs before a woman in 
cat ears and fishnets has marked 
my forehead with a red lipstick V, 
for virgin (so much for blending in). 
Thankfully, there seem to be some 
other V’s walking around and none 
of the veterans are bothered by the 
fact that none of us seem to know 
what’s going on. I am handed a red 
balloon with my Sour Patch Kids 
and make my way to the theater.

Before the movie begins, an 

usher dressed like a French maid 
asks for three virgin volunteers. I 
heard a rumor that they make you 
fake an orgasm, so I don’t raise my 
hand. Luckily for these three, they 
are only asked to blow up a condom 
balloon. Then all us V’s are asked to 
blow up our red balloons and meta-
phorically pop our cherries. 

Finally, the lights dim, and 

the crowd goes wild. Actually 
the crowd has been going wild 
this whole time, but the volume 
increases exponentially when a 
pair of lips appears on the screen. 
Once the movie begins, it doesn’t 
take long for the group leaders to 
assert themselves: two men, one 
on either side of the theater who 
yell louder and more frequently 
than anyone else. If they’re the lead 
actors, the rest of the theater is the 
chorus. Everyone (including me, 
thanks to the Internet) knows to 
yell “slut” at Janet and “asshole” at 
Brad — the “Rocky Horror” basics. 
But, these two men have a whole 
script of jokes timed perfectly to 
the movie.

The ringleader in my half of 

the theater is an older guy, pos-
sibly the oldest one in the theater. 
He’s dressed as Eddie, a secondary 
character who gets icepicked to 
death and then served for dinner, 
and he’s hilarious. Two minutes 
don’t go by without this guy throw-
ing out a great one-liner. This is 
clearly his own script. He name-
drops local celebrities and jokes 
about the Michigan State game 
(to mixed reactions; perhaps that 
wound is still too fresh). 

As much as everyone here loves 

to yell, they also love to throw 
things. Rice, water and toast are 
all airborne during the movie. And, 
it seems there is a prop for every-
thing. Even the “light over at the 
Frankenstein place” appears in the 
audience in the form of approxi-
mately one hundred tiny flash-
lights waving back and forth. 

“Rocky Horror” is like a big 

inside joke that you’re supposed to 
catch on to. There’s a performance 
aspect to the whole thing, as if the 
veterans are putting on a show for 
the virgins. It doesn’t really mat-
ter that I don’t have a flashlight or 
a costume. Because, as I’m singing 
along (some of the lyrics are much 
dirtier than the “Glee” covers) and 
stumbling through the call-and-
responses, it feels good to be, at 
least temporarily, part of this weird 
and wild community. It’s nice that 
these veteran fans can love some-
thing without taking it too seri-
ously.

Don’t watch “Rocky Horror” on 

your laptop or even on your friend’s 

TV— throw on a corset and some 
red lipstick, and go lose your vir-
ginity. 

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
Evaluating modernist 
aesthetics in 2015

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

“Art for art’s sake” is the 

translation of a popular French 
19th century slogan (l’art pour 
l’art), registering the modernist 
sensibilities that were sweep-
ing through Europe at the time. 
That kind of art, removed from 
philosophical, moral or politi-
cal investments, seems differ-
ent altogether from the artistic 
aspirations of today’s mega-art-
ists like Kanye West who “will 
die for truth and that’s what’s 
closest to art.” Which kind of 
art is “better,” anyway?

My dad (and many of his 

friends) 
might 
insist 
that 

Handel is the greatest musician 
of all time. In fact, my first con-
cert was Handel’s opera “Her-
cules.” Thankfully, my mom 
took me to Jingle Ball 2004 
later the same year for some 
sweet notes from the great clas-
sic Ashlee Simpson. 

My best friend’s dad, on the 

other hand, would lay down his 
life in defense of The Beatles as 
history’s musical all-stars. Oth-
ers faint to the stylings of Justin 
Bieber.

How do we reconcile the 

opposing pedestals and success 
of “Fifty Shades of Grey” with 
2013 Best-Seller “Americanah” 
and the classics of Steinbeck 
and Hemingway? The Beliebers 
and the Met season ticket own-
ers? Can these cultural pref-
erences be attributed to taste 
alone? One looks down at the 
other, and the other scoffs and 
turns to its own audience.

Everyone is familiar with the 

cultural division I’m describ-
ing, between “high” culture and 
popular culture. However, most 
of us, myself included, aren’t 
too sure how the difference 
comes about in the first place 
and what makes it so. 

Thankfully, for those explor-

ing the question, others have 
attempted to do some of the 
answering. Last week, in my 
reading for a French Modern-

ist art history course, I worked 
through a highly influential 
essay by Clement Greenberg, 
“Avante-Garde 
and 
Kitsch,” 

published in 1939 in the Parti-
san Review.

Greenberg’s essay means to 

draw a distinction between 
true, genuine culture and pop-
ular art. As Greenberg observes 
culture becoming increasingly 
stagnant in the mid 20th cen-
tury — avoiding controversy, 
repeating classical themes and 
following rules, the “avante-
garde” emerge. They belong to 
the ruling class, although they 
consider themselves separate 
from it. This new group’s proj-
ect is to create pure art: “art for 
art’s sake,” and save “genuine” 
culture in the midst of ideolog-
ical confusion.

But with the avante-gard 

comes the rear-gard — this 
kind of culture is summed up 
by the German word kitsch, 
and refers to popular art, com-
mercials, 
magazines, 
litera-

ture, music videos, cartoons 
and toys. In Greenberg’s under-
standing, kitsch borrows form 
the genuine culture, converts 
and dilutes it into a digestible 
form for the masses. Kitsch 
was a response to the needs 
of working people for enter-
tainment and culture, without 
complication.

If some part of culture is 

“genuine,” then kitsch repre-
sents the debased and trivial 
— yet simultaneously decep-
tive — part of culture. Kitsch 
mimics genuine culture and 
high art. It produces the same 
effects images, materials and 
references 
that 
are 
easily 

understood, which gives the 
spectator a shortcut.

It is complex, multilayered 

and appears to seek some 
kind of truth. And sometimes, 
Greenberg says, kitsch can pro-
duce something important.

In the time of Mussolini, 

Hitler and Stalin, the spread 
of kitsch was a danger, art 
that was readily prepared to 

become part of the machine 
and put culture in handcuffs. 
Undoubtedly, it did take hold 
under these leaders, with doc-
trines like “socialist realism” 
that controlled art in Russia.

Kitsch relies on the capital-

ism machine and wealthy for 
its production and success, as 
the machine comes to rely on 
it. It is the “umbilical cord of 
gold.” In this way, Greenberg 
was right about kitsch becom-
ing an international language. 
He was wrong about some 
things, though.

The 
avante-garde 
never 

gave up or succumbed to pres-
sure of popular culture. In fact, 
through the rest of the 20th 
century, and certainly in my 
lifetime, it has increased in rec-
ognition: Think of the rise of 
Jazz music. It has innovated: 
Think of Andy Warhol, who 
mimicked pop culture in order 
to elevate it to the status of high 
art. It has merged mediums: 
Think of Pina Bausch dance 
productions, their set designs 
and use of sound.

Of course, art today, in any 

form, is still part of the appara-
tus of money and power. There 
is more to be done in extending 
access to art through all classes 
and geographies. But the lines 
between 
avante-garde 
and 

kitsch are no longer as stark as 
they once were.

The woman at the coffee 

shop reading Steinbeck last 
week may be in a different cof-
fee shop today reading “Fifty 
Shades” (though possibly with 
the cover sleeve removed). 
There are fewer boundaries 
and fewer rules in today’s cul-
tural landscape. Controversy 
need not be avoided by instead 
focusing on the abstract, in 
absolutes. Artists can make 
“art for art’s sake,” should they 
choose, or they can sing about 
their hotline nostalgias. Both 
are needed, and both have been 
fulfilled. Greenberg’s cultural 
stagnation has been taken off 
pause.

tion with pop-punk virtuosos All 
Time Low, Benji and Joel Madden 
and John Feldmann has no doubt 
taken them from “the guys who 
opened for One Direction” to the 
guys you should take seriously. 
Compared to their freshman self-
titled album, 5 Seconds of Sum-
mer sounds more confident and 
sophisticated this time around. 
Each song features its own sty-
listic hallmark trait, whether that 
be honest lyrics, an unusual vocal 
shift or a mind-blowing instru-
mental moment. This, combined 
with the more evident pop-punk 

undertones, makes for a pleasing 
sophomore album.

I wasn’t sue how I felt about 

Sounds Good Feels Good when 
I first listened to it, but after 
listening to the album for the 
fourth time through, I can safely 
say that it’s low-key amazing. It’s 
amazing because this 17-track 
deluxe edition of the album will 
find mainstream-radio success 
in a time when pop-punk is a 
genre of music that most people 
don’t care about. The only other 
pop-punk band known to the 
masses is Fall Out Boy and maybe 
Panic! At the Disco. 5 Seconds 
of Summer’s unique position as 
the new pioneers of pop-punk 
makes Sounds Good Feels Good 
not only a relevant album but one 
that determines the future of an 
entire music scene.

The best song on the album 

by far is “Castaway” — this is 
both the most punk and the 
most instrumentally and vocal-
ly unique track. The rhythm is 
undoubtedly catchy, and the 
genre’s standard angst and atti-
tude are more present than ever. 

The multiple layers of the song 
add a complexity that you can’t 
help but listen to on a nonstop 
loop, making it an all-around 
high-energy standout song.

In addition to “Castaway,” 

there are several other unique 
songs that give Sounds Good Feels 
Good the solid support it needs 
to be a game-changing album for 
the Australian quartet. You can 
see the band’s punk influences 
throughout the album, but “Outer 
Space/Carry 
On” 
particularly 

echoes Green Day’s “Holiday/
Boulevard of Broken Dreams” in 
that the two songs flow together 
by way of a guitar reverb. While 
“Outer Space/Carry On” is an 
example of the band’s growing 
pop-punk maturity, “Invisible” 
and “Broken Home” are prime 
examples of how the band writes 
about their own experiences with 
insecurity, depression and anxi-
ety. This is important because 
mental illness is a problem that 
plagues all societies around the 
world, so their music can help 
others and serve as an anthem for 
those battling similar issues.

Considering the fact that most 

pop-punk songs start sounding the 
same after a while, I’m impressed 
that Sounds Good Feels Good man-
ages to incorporate a plethora of 
unique tracks. It helps that vari-
ous pop-punk artists helped 5 
Seconds of Summer write some of 
their songs; each artist has their 
own distinct style that influenced 
their writing. For example, Alex 
Gaskarth of All Time Low con-
tributed to the upbeat pop-heavy 
“Catch Fire” while the influence 
of the Madden brothers, two-fifths 
of pop-punk band Good Charlotte, 
can clearly be heard on the album’s 
first four tracks. Interestingly, the 
two best songs on the album were 
written by just members of the 
band. “Castaway” was written by 
Hood and Hemmings, while “Jet 
Black Heart” was solely written by 
Hood and Clifford. If the two best 
songs are written by the band, this 
signals that their future work can 
only get better. Sounds Good Feels 
Good is 5 Seconds of Summer’s 
way of breaking into the pop-punk 
scene. It’s only a matter of time 
before they dominate the genre 
and leave their mark on it and the 
music industry as a whole.

TV NOTEBOOK
‘Buffy’ ahead of her 
time, even in 2015

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

I’ve made some big mistakes 

in my life. Calculating how 
many hours I spent binge-
watching 
every 
episode 
of 

“Degrassi” in 10th grade was 
one of them. Spending the first 
two months of this summer 
binge-watching all of “Buffy 
the Vampire Slayer” for the 
first time was not. (But I still 
refuse to do that math.)

I’d 
heard 
references 
to 

“Buffy” before, but I’d never 
seen an episode until the cool 
girl who lived in the dorm 
room across from me last year 
physically dragged me from 
my room into hers and made 
me watch the pilot. (She is now 
my roommate. Coincidence? I 
think not.)

I was hooked after just a half 

hour. And after watching the 
first season, I could understand 
why 
Buffy 
has 
the 
cult 

following she does. The show 
is funny and well-written, and 
being from the ’90s, just campy 
enough to be endearing. Seeing 
faces I had always associated 
with other movies or shows 
— Sarah Michelle Gellar from 
“Cruel Intentions” and David 
Boreanaz from “Bones” — was 
strange at first, but now it’s 
impossible to think of them 
as anything other than part of 
Buffy’s posse.

But one thing especially 

stood out while watching this 
show: In terms of feminist 
writing on TV, “Buffy” was 
ahead of its time. Series creator 
Joss Whedon said that he 
wanted to reverse the blonde-
girl-always-getting-eaten-
by-monsters trope and write 
a blonde girl who was able 
to kill the monsters herself. 
At first, I was skeptical. In 
trying too hard to reverse a 
trope, it’s easy to fall victim 
to other kinds of stereotypes. 
That’s how the Manic Pixie 
Dream Girl waltzed onto our 
doorsteps — people started 
writing 
women 
characters 

who were “different” or “not 
like other girls,” and we ended 
up with disasters like Natalie 
Portman in “Garden State.”

But over and over, “Buffy 

the Vampire Slayer” proved to 
be an answer to my feminist 
prayers. Whedon got a lot 
of things right, not the least 
being how to write a real 
love story between a human 
and a vampire — not one 
that portrays a controlling 
relationship 
and 
a 
stupid 

heroine. Certain Young Adult 
novelists should have watched 
“Buffy” more carefully.

One of the main things that I 

love — other than the fact that 
Buffy is the most powerful in 
her town as the one Slayer of 
vampires — is how the men, 
particularly Giles and Xander, 
are portrayed on the show. 
Giles may be the adult, but he 

never questions the fact that 
at the end of the day, it’s Buffy 
calling the shots. He never 
patronizes her because she’s a 
teenage girl. And while there 
are some side jokes here and 
there about how Xander needs 
to maintain his “manliness” 
because he’s always in a girl-
dominated environment, his 
character never falls prey to 
the idea that men can’t be 
emotional.

“Buffy” 
also 
captures 

elements of teenage sexuality 
with well-written scenes and 
nuanced 
performances. 
For 

example, Willow and Tara’s 
relationship 
is 
organically 

introduced and maintained. 
The best thing about this 
relationship is how no one 
makes a huge deal out of 
it involving two women. It 
doesn’t feel like the writers 
are saying, “How progressive 
are we? Lesbians! Look! There 
are two of them!” They don’t 
oversexualize 
Willow 
and 

Tara, nor do they remove their 
sexuality.

On a more humorous note, 

there are two other characters 
who 
love 
sex 
and 
aren’t 

ashamed to show it: Anya and 
Faith. No one shames them 
for loving sex and initiating it 
frequently. Of course, Buffy’s 
relationships are always given 
the most screentime, but some 
of the most honest depictions 
of 
relationships 
belong 
to 

these other characters.

In addition to giving all of 

the women a large measure 
of sexual autonomy, “Buffy” 
splinters a concept that is 
so often disguised as female 
empowerment, that sometimes 
we 
don’t 
recognize 
it 
as 

problematic at its core — the 
idea of the Alpha Female and 
her bitches. Even though Buffy 
is “the Slayer,” Faith is “the 
Slayer,” too. They don’t always 
get along in the beginning, but 
it’s never the case that there 
is a finite amount of power 
that must be split between 
them — there’s only double 
the power. It’s nice to finally 
see two totally badass, funny, 
attractive, intelligent women 
go head to head — but without 
needing to have one finally 
come out on top. By the end 
of the series, there is plenty of 
room for both of them.

Lastly — and I know some 

people disagree — I think 
the finale holds one of the 
keys to “Buffy” ’s feminism. 
Though I think the finale 
had its problems, I’ll always 
love it for its final message 
about 
empowering 
women. 

Buffy and Willow work some 
magic so that every girl out 
there who has the potential 
to be a Slayer becomes one. 
There’s a beautiful montage 
of girls all over the world 
suddenly finding themselves 
with super-strength and a 
new confidence in their eyes; 
one girl hits a home run out 
of the park, while another one 
catches the man’s fist that was 
about to hit her and throws it 
aside, slowly standing up.

I 
know 
“Buffy” 
isn’t 

perfect, even when looked 
at within the context of the 
decade it was made. There is 
a noticeable lack of people of 
color in the show, and most 
seem to be from an ambiguous 
middle class. But it is one 
of the most overtly feminist 
shows 
I’ve 
ever 
seen 
— 

especially for shows directed 
at teens, which is important. 
And in a world where people 
are still questioning whether 
the 
masses 
will 
still 
be 

interested in something if 
it unapologetically features 
strong 
women, 
“Buffy” 
’s 

popularity 
and 
importance 

can’t be overlooked. If you 
haven’t watched it yet, you 
should. It’s on Netflix. You 
have no excuse.

THE WB

Are we just not gonna talk about the guy with the eye patch?

After watching the 
first season, I can 
understand why 
Buffy has the cult 
following she does.

Improving defense 
seeks consistency

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

TROY, N.Y. — The No. 11 

Michigan hockey team has played 
just four games this season, but 
its 2015 campaign already looks 
much different than the last.

Last 
year, 
the 
Wolverines 

opened the season with a loss to 
Ferris State before falling to 2-5 
over the following six games. This 
year, Michigan stands at 3-0-1 
after leaving upstate New York 
with a tie and win over No. 18 
Union and Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, respectively.

But despite the contrasting 

starts, one thing has followed the 
Wolverines from 2014: defensive 
inconsistency.

This weekend, the defensive 

unit 
showed 
it’s 
more 
than 

capable of excellence, but only on 
occasion. The talent is there, it’s 
just a matter of bringing it out on 
a game-to-game basis.

To 
start, 
sophomore 

defenseman Zach Werenski has 
been as good as advertised, and 
junior Michael Downing has 
complemented him well on the 
first line.

Junior Nolan De Jong has 

improved drastically after an 
impressive offseason that earned 

acknowledgment 
from 
the 

coaching staff.

Freshmen 
Nick 
Boka 
and 

Joseph Cecconi have quickly 
adapted to the collegiate level, 
earning 
significant 
minutes 

through the first four games.

To round out the regulars, 

sophomore Cutler Martin has 
been a physical presence on the 
ice. 

But in its two-game road trip 

this weekend, Michigan’s defense 
looked 
like 
two 
completely 

different teams.

The Wolverines allowed Union 

to pile on five goals on 33 shots 
Friday, and would have suffered an 
upset if it weren’t for late heroics 
from junior center JT Compher 
and senior forward Justin Selman.

Michigan struggled to clear 

the puck out of the defensive zone 
and committed careless turnovers 
that 
turned 
into 
dangerous 

opportunities for the Dutchmen.

“Part of it is we had some bad 

shifts where we didn’t get the 
puck out of our zone and we tried 
to beat guys one on one,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“We got a lot of little hockey plays 
that we’ll talk about that we can do 
better. There were shifts where it 
was like (Union) had a power play,

An old adage with new meaning

T

hree seasons ago, it was 
hard to imagine the 
Michigan hockey team 

would end up 
here. Three 
seasons ago, 
the Wolver-
ines missed 
the NCAA 
Tournament 
with a loss 
in their last 
game of the 
season, and 
then it hap-
pened again 
in 2014, and again in 2015. All of 
a sudden, none of the players on 
their current roster have played 
in the NCAA Tournament.

“I’ve never had a taste in the 

tournament, and I’ve been here 
almost four years now,” said 
senior forward Boo Nieves on 
Wednesday. “It’s definitely hard-
er, because every year it feels 
like I’ve been getting farther 
and farther away. We need to 
make sure we do things right the 
first time so we don’t find our-
selves digging ourselves a hole.”

That three-year skid is a dubi-

ous one, but if you’ve followed 
the program at all, you know 
about the one that came before 
it. From 1991 to 2012, Michigan 
reached 22 consecutive NCAA 
Tournaments.

There’s a fine line between 

trying to forget that streak and 
trying to emulate it. It can be 
the Wolverines’ worst enemy 
or their best friend. On the one 
hand, it seems more than any-
thing like the elephant in the 
room. On the other, it’s part of 
the tradition of the program, 
and it’s better to have that tradi-
tion and try to build on it than 
not to have it at all.

“We don’t want to over-dwell 

on last year or the year before,” 
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. “This is a new team, a new 
season and a new schedule. But 

we know as coaches we’ve got 
to get off to a better start, and 
we’ve got to be a better team for 
the whole season.”

But no one on this year’s team 

has played on an NCAA Tourna-
ment team, and if that remains 
the case next spring, the senior 
class will be the first one in a 
quarter-century to graduate 
without an appearance. Six play-
ers on the 2015 roster were 14 
the last time Michigan played in 
the NCAA Tournament, and that 
statistic will only get bleaker if 
the streak continues.

Fortunately for the Wolver-

ines, the brighter days aren’t 
too far in the past yet, and the 
coach at the helm knows how to 
get them back there. The biggest 
key Michigan has talked about 

so far is taking care of business 
in early-season non-conference 
games, which it hasn’t done in 
recent years.

“It’s been tough trying to 

wait until the last minute the 
last three years,” Nieves said. 
“This year, it’s my last year, so 
I want to make sure that we get 
off to the right start so we’re not 
stuck on our heels in the Big Ten 
Tournament.”

Nieves remembers those situ-

ations well, as they have come in 
the past two years (before that, 
it was the CCHA Tournament 
that decided Michigan’s fate). 
The Wolverines know what 
forced them to go down to the 
wire: They didn’t win the non-
conference games they should 
have.

In the past three seasons, 

when Michigan missed the tour-
nament, the Wolverines were 
19-13-2 outside their conference, 
excluding postseason contests. 
In the previous four years, when 
they made the tournament in 
each one, they went 22-10-3 in 
the non-conference.

One game per season might 

not seem like a big difference, 
but when you consider the mar-
gin by which the Wolverines 
have missed the NCAA Tour-
nament, it’s all the difference. 
Sure, Big Ten Tournament losses 
to Penn State (2014) and Min-
nesota (2015) were the imme-
diate causes, but Michigan’s 
struggles dated back far earlier. 
The Wolverines can’t win the 
Big Ten Tournament in October 

or November, but they can put 
themselves in a good position 
by winning games against non-
league opponents.

“I think I can speak for pretty 

much anyone that’s played for 
Michigan hockey that you’re 
not going to take a game for 
granted,” said junior forward JT 
Compher. “That’s the way we’re 
playing this year — you’re not 
taking any game for granted.”

That emphasis shows up in 

several areas. Michigan is work-
ing harder to score first this 
season, but also to win the third 
period and hold down leads. 
The Wolverines also know they 
have to protect their home ice, 
where they dropped games to 
New Hampshire, Penn State and 
Michigan State last season.

Nieves said that new mindset 

has made a difference in the 
team’s energy so far this season. 
No longer can the Wolverines 
lose focus early in the season 
and make up ground in March.

Through two weeks of the 

season, they have avoided dan-
ger. They escaped Mercyhurst 
at home twice, 3-2 and 6-4, and 
then came away from upstate 
New York with a 5-5 tie against 
Union and a 5-2 win over Rens-
selaer.

None of those results will put 

the entire country on notice, 
but Michigan has taken its new 
attitude and used it to avoid a 
potentially résumé-killing loss 
in the first two weeks. Maybe 
that’s good enough for now.

Berenson doesn’t have to go 

back far in the history books to 
find a time when they failed to 
do even that. Last year, a tal-
ented team dropped the opener 
at Ferris State, lost at Boston 
University three weeks later and 
then suffered two blowout losses 
at Michigan Tech.

At that point, the Wolverines 

were 2-5, and as Berenson said 
Wednesday, “All of a sudden, 
we were on our heels. We really 
never recovered from those.”

Two years ago, Michigan 

went 8-4-2 in non-conference 
play but fell to Penn State in the 
Big Ten Tournament, dropping 
out of the NCAA Tournament 
field.

“That’s how one game can 

change your whole RPI and your 
season,” Berenson said. “We’ve 
got to worry about every game.”

“Every game counts” is an old 

adage that almost every coach 
uses, but the Michigan hockey 
team knows it better than any-
one else. Three years of heart-
break will teach you that.

Michigan coach Red Berenson has encouraged his team to put greater emphasis on early-season non-conference games to prepare for the NCAA Tournament hunt.

and we couldn’t get out of the 
zone.

“So that’s where we were tired 

and we just couldn’t get off to 
change. It was a little bit of a test 
for our team, and we got away 
with it.”

Yet the next day, the Wolverine 

blueliners held RPI to just two 
goals on 21 shots — making their 
defensive performance on Friday 
appear to be an anomaly. They 
tallied 18 blocked shots, cleared 
the 
puck 
more 
effectively, 

ramped up the physicality and 
limited the same turnovers that 
plagued them against Union.

Friday night’s foe was the 

stronger one. RPI is unranked, 
while Union is the 18th-ranked 
team in the nation. After the 
Engineers beat then-No. 1 Boston 
College on Oct. 11, though, there 
was no question that RPI had 
talent — regardless of ranking 
— that needed to be contained. 
That makes Michigan’s defensive 
inconsistency 
even 
more 

puzzling.

“Our team defense was better, 

(we had) more backcheck, more 
shutdown and more playing the 
way we can play,” said freshman 
forward Brendan Warren. “We 
kept pucks out of the net, and 
that let us play more offense.”

Michigan didn’t pay for its 

costly mistakes this time around, 
but without consistent defensive 
play, the Wolverines might not be 
so fortunate next time.

Six of seven 

Wolverines finish 
5K race in under 

18 minutes

By TOR THORNE

For the Daily

As 
the 
No. 
2 
Michigan 

women’s cross country team 
looks ahead to the Big Ten 
Championships 
next 
week, 

Friday’s EMU Classic gave some 
of the team’s younger and more 
inexperienced 
members 
an 

opportunity to showcase their 
development 
and 
continued 

improvement.

The 
Wolverines 
did 
not 

disappoint 
in 
the 
5,000-

meter contest, as dry course 
conditions propelled six of the 
seven Wolverines to finish the 
race in under 
18 minutes. All 
seven finished 
within the top 
25 runners.

More 
so, 

several of the 
Wolverines 
met personal 
goals 
in 

Friday’s race, 
according 
to 
Michigan 

coach Mark McGuire.

Leading the way for the 

Wolverines 
was 
redshirt 

sophomore Corrine Florie, who 
placed 
sixth 
overall. 
Florie 

missed the cut for this year’s 
postseason roster and came into 
Friday’s race with something 
to prove. She clocked in with 
a personal record of 17:41.6, 
about 26 seconds faster than 
her 5,000-meter time at the 
beginning of the year.

“You can’t let the pressure get 

to you,” Florie said. “You still 
have to come out and perform, 
and it’s the time and the results 
that matter.”

Trailing just a few seconds 

behind 
Florie 
was 
redshirt 

junior Gina McNamara, whose 
17:48.7 time was a new personal 
best on the course, placing her 
eighth to narrowly beat out 
fifth-year senior Laura Addison 
(17:48.9).

Other notable performances 

came in the form of new top 
5,000-meter times for redshirt 
freshmen Ellie Leonard and 
Holly Petrusson, who finished 
11th 
and 
14th, 
respectively. 

Sandwiched between them was 
senior Olivia Bracket, who came 
in 12th.

Rounding out the Wolverines 

in 
uniform 
was 
redshirt 

freshman Sydney Badger with a 
time of 18:26.6 and a 22nd-place 
finish.

Following the race, McGuire 

reiterated 
the 
significance 

of 
Friday’s 
meet 
for 
the 

development of his program.

“We’re going to have some 

people 
step 

into 
some 

new 
roles,” 

McGuire said. 
“This type of 
meet serves as 
a benchmark 
for people that 
will move on 
and could very 
possibly 
be 

going to the 
Big Ten meet 

next year.”

According to McGuire, for 

many of the race’s participants, 
the EMU Classic will be the last 
race they run this fall before 
track and field begins in the 
winter.

As a result, the runners 

treated the race like it was 
the 
postseason. 
Regarding 

individuals in Friday’s race, 
McGuire had a resoundingly 
positive outlook for the team’s 
future and the young talent it 
currently possesses.

“We will have athletes that 

ran today run in the Big Ten 
meet next year, I can tell you 
that for a fact,” McGuire said.

WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY

“We’re going to 
have some people 

step into some 

new roles.”

and often, forcing turnovers and 
turning clearing the puck into 
a virtually impossible task for 
RPI. Michigan connected well 
through center and outshot the 
Engineers (1-4-1), 6-4.

Though the shot difference 

between the two clubs wasn’t 
significant, RPI’s carelessness 
with the puck and the Wolverines’ 
defensive 
pressure 
allowed 

them to enjoy the majority of 
possession.

“We were coming off a hard-

fought game last night, and I 
think that helped us get a good 
start,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “We had the juices 
running, we got into playing a fast 
game last night, and I think that 
really helped us.”

The 
Engineers’ 
most 

dangerous 
opportunity 
came 

with 8:31 left in the period, when 
RPI broke out on a three-on-two 
counter. Forward Travis Fulton 
received the puck in the circle 
and fired a shot on net, but junior 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort was 
up to the task.

Michigan 
answered 
its 

captain’s call for energy to begin 
the second period as well.

Just 28 seconds into the frame, 

junior 
forward 
Tyler 
Motte 

carried the puck through the 
right circle before backhanding 
it from his knees inside the far 
post. With his spectacular effort, 
Motte put the Wolverines up 2-0 
against the Engineers.

Each side notched another 

goal in the period — RPI’s after a 
combination between Fulton and 
Zach Schroeder, and Michigan’s 
coming 
off 

the stick of 
sophomore 
forward Tony 
Calderone.

The 

Engineers 
looked 
more 

comfortable 
in 
their 

offensive zone 
in the second, 
accumulating 
three more shots than they had in 
the previous period. Yet the same 
could be said for the Wolverines, 
as they tallied 11 shots compared 
to their total of six in the first.

The third period remained 

quiet on both ends until the 13th 
minute, when RPI forward Jake 
Wood found twine during a 
power play to reduce Michigan’s 
lead to one. The goal gave the 
Engineers new life, as they looked 
more threatening on the offensive 
end. But they never mustered the 
tying goal before the Wolverines 
could respond with a lamp lighter 

of their own five minutes later.

Michigan iced the game with 

1:34 left to play, finishing an 
empty-net breakaway for its fifth 
goal of the game.

Nagelvoort 
was 
impressive 

throughout the contest, tallying 10 
saves. Though the second goal he 
conceded could have been saved, 
the first goal he surrendered was 

largely due to 
an impressive 
effort 
by 

Fulton. 
The 
RPI 

forward drew 
Nagelvoort 
out of position 
while 
in 

possession, 
before 
laying 

the 
puck 
in 

front 
for 
an 

easy tap in.

With the victory over RPI, the 

Wolverines finished their upstate 
New York road trip with a win 
and a tie — and in the process 
have accomplished one small 
thing to begin the season that 
Boston College couldn’t.

“These were two tough teams 

in two tough buildings (this 
weekend),” Berenson said. “This 
is good for our team to get a 
positive feel about our own team 
on the road. We had a lot of young 
players play well, and so I’d say it 
was a good experience for us.”

Wolverines turn in 
mixed performance

Michigan rests 
top runners to 

prepare for Big Ten 

Championships

By LOGAN T. HANSEN

For the Daily

DEXTER, Mich. — With the 

Big Ten Championships looming 
on Sunday, the top nine runners 
for the No. 5 Michigan men’s 
cross country 
team took the 
time 
to 
get 

some 
extra 

practice 
and 

rest 
in 
on 

Friday.

Other 

members 
of 

the 
team, 

however, 
received 
a 
taste 
of 

competition 
at the Eastern 
Michigan Fall 
Classic, a 5K 
race held at 
Hudson Mills 
Metro Park in Dexter.

The 
Wolverines 
brought 

eight uniformed athletes to 
the event, with several others 
running unattached. Out of 81 
competitors, fifth-year senior 
transfer 
Jonathan 
Phillips 

(15:03.1) and redshirt freshman 
Kyle Kroon (15:10.1) finished 
second and third, respectively, 
though Phillips ran unattached.

The two leading men for 

Michigan finished behind only 
Justine Kiprotich (14:58.7), who 
was running unattached for 
Michigan State.

“Going into it, it was good 

to have a few races under me,” 

Kroon said. “It was the first time 
I was the top guy on our team 
going in, so it was a different 
mental game.”

Friday’s meet was the second 

time Kroon had run at Hudson 
Mills. His performance proved 
to be a 40-second improvement 
from his first outing there at the 
beginning of last season.

Phillips, who is not eligible 

for the Big Ten Championships, 
has been training with the 
Wolverines 
all 
season 
to 

prepare for indoor and outdoor 
track.

“I was a little bummed about 

getting second, getting out-
kicked,” Phillips said. “But I 
put forth a real solid effort — 
(I) went out 
hard 
and 

kind of got 
in there right 
from the gun 
and just kept 
at 
it, 
kept 

grinding the 
whole 
race. 

I was pretty 
happy 
with 

that.”

Five 
other 
uniformed 

Wolverines finished in the top 
15. Joining Kroon in the top 10 
were redshirt freshmen Colin 
Martin 
(15:22.4) 
and 
Chase 

Barnett (15:23.7), who placed 
ninth and 10th, respectively.

They 
were 
followed 
by 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Cody 

Snavely 
(15:27.8), 
redshirt 

sophomore Will Burke (15:27.9) 
and senior Alex Moran (15:29.8), 
who finished 13th through 15th, 
respectively.

Freshman 
Keenan 
Rebera 

(15:17.5) joined Phillips as the 
other unattached runner from 
Michigan to place in the top 10, 
coming in at seventh.

“(This) was a chance for 

guys that didn’t make our Big 
Ten roster to get a competitive 
opportunity,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kevin Sullivan. “I need 
them to stay sharp in case we 
need to put them in for regionals 
or nationals, so part of it was 
making sure that we’re staying 
in a competitive mindset and 
staying focused on the full 
extent of the season.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

secondary lineup turned in a 
wholly impressive performance 
at Hudson Mills, Sullivan made 
it clear that Michigan is not only 
looking to win, but to dominate 
its opponents.

“I thought it was a little bit 

of a mixed bag,” Sullivan said. 

“We had a 
few 
guys 

running 
in 

jerseys that 
need to take 
another 
step up. We 
didn’t quite 
see what we 
were looking 
for 
today 

from 
some 

of those guys, but we’re going 
to keep plugging away and keep 
working at it.”

The EMU Fall Classic was the 

final race of the regular season 
for the Wolverines. Next up is 
the Big Ten Championships, 
which will take place in Chicago 
at the Sydney R. Marovitz Golf 
Course on Sunday.

“I think our guys are feeling 

good,” Sullivan said. “We’re in 
good shape going into Big Tens. 
We’re going to have to come 
with all nine guys running their 
best, but if we come in and put 
it all together, we’ll have a shot 
to win.

“We expect to be competing 

for a championship.”

Defense leads Michigan

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN

For the Daily

It took 91 minutes, but the 

Michigan women’s soccer team 
was able to beat Purdue 1-0 in 
overtime 
Saturday, 
completing 
its 
second 

consecutive shutout. 

In a physical battle, the 

Wolverines came away with a 
win on Senior Night thanks to an 
excellent defensive effort. 

Prior 
to 
the 
game, 
the 

Wolverines stressed one thing: 
leaving the seniors with a lasting 
memory. 

After 
90 
minutes, 
the 

match was still tied at 0-0, 
and 
Michigan 
had 
outshot 

the Boilermakers, 11-7, but its 
objective was still incomplete.

Like the Wolverines’ previous 

game against Minnesota, this 
match required overtime. Just 
two minutes into the extra frame, 
junior forward Nicky Waldeck, 
off 
a 
pass 
from 
freshman 

forward Reilly Martin, broke 
free and scored the only goal 

of the game, giving Michigan 
and the seniors the final home 
victory of their season. 

“I felt like tonight the girls 

were really aggressive taking 
their chances,” said Michigan 
coach Greg Ryan. “They’re doing 
really well.” 

After a late loss to Wisconsin 

and 
a 
scoreless 
tie 
with 

Minnesota, Michigan (6-2-2 Big 
Ten, 11-5-2 overall) was in need 
of a win against Purdue (3-6-2, 
8-8-1) in order to stay near the 
top of the conference standings. 
The match began balanced, as 
both teams’ defenses kept the 
opposing offense away from the 
goal.

“We always try to set play, and 

I think that just really helps our 
attacking line get the ball and 
get more shots off,” said senior 
defender Christina Murillo. 

The Wolverines began to 

put 
more 
pressure 
on 
the 

Boilermakers’ 
defense 
by 

maneuvering through the field 
to create open shots, though 
Michigan was unable to put 
the ball in the net. The Purdue 
goalkeeper stood tall in the 

first half, deflecting tough shots 
and making key saves. Various 
offside calls early on stopped 
scoring opportunities for the 
Wolverines as well. 

Michigan’s 
best 
scoring 

chance in the first half came in 
the 37th minute, when a Purdue 
defender got tangled up and lost 
control of the ball near her own 
goal. The ball found freshman 
midfielder 
Abby 
Kastroll, 

whose shot was stopped by 
the Boilermakers once again. 
At the end of the first half, the 
Wolverines had outshot Purdue, 
5-3. 

“In 
the 
locker 
room 
at 

halftime, it wasn’t really much 
changing anything, it was to 
continue to keep the foot on the 
gas,” Waldeck said. “It was to 
just not let up and continue what 
we did in the first half.” 

Though Michigan played at 

a much faster pace than it did 
in the first half, both teams 
controlled the ball equally in the 
second half, with neither able to 
find the net. But the Wolverines 
persisted, and Waldeck’s tally 
left the seniors in good spirits.

Buckeyes outlast 
Michigan in four

No. 6 Ohio State 
wins tight match, 
hands Wolverines 
second straight loss

By COLE ZINGAS

For the Daily

The 
No. 
24 
Michigan 

volleyball team was looking to 
defeat a ranked opponent for 
the 
first 

time 
since 

upsetting 
then-No. 
10 Ohio State last year, but on 
Saturday night, the Wolverines 
couldn’t achieve their goal. 

Michigan (5-5 Big Ten, 15-6 

overall) fell to rival No. 6 Ohio 
State at Cliff Keen Arena, 3-1. 
Recurring 
late-set 
mishaps 

by the Wolverines led them 
to lose the final two sets. The 
Wolverines were in each set until 
the end, and all four sets were 
decided by two points.

“We just need to get two points 

better,” said junior outside hitter 
Abby Cole. 

The 
game 
plan 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
was 
to 
have 
a 

balanced 
attack, 
and 
coach 

Mark Rosen rotated players’ 
positions, subbing in and out 
frequently, so everyone could get 
in on the action. Seven different 
Wolverines recorded kills in the 
first set, but Rosen still wasn’t 
happy with the production from 
his team out of the gate.

“I don’t think Ohio State 

played great in the first set,” 
Rosen said. “I think we let them 
do what they wanted to do 
because we didn’t play defense.” 

Michigan lost the first set, 

25-23, but came back in the 
second 
behind 
big 
late-set 

kills from Cole and sophomore 
outside hitter Adeja Lambert to 
tie the match at one game apiece.

The 
Wolverines 
led 
the 

Buckeyes for the majority of 
the third and fourth sets, but 

couldn’t put their rival away. 
Ohio State (8-2, 19-3) came right 
back whenever it was down a 
few points, and was able to save 
two crucial set points in both 
the third and fourth sets. The 
Buckeyes went on to win both of 
those sets, 28-26.

Cole recorded six kills in the 

fourth set, along with three 
blocks, but it wasn’t enough to 
beat a consistent attack from the 
Ohio State front line. Outside 
hitters Elizabeth Campbell and 
Luisa Schirmer combined for 33 
kills in the match, including the 
Buckeyes’ final four kills to finish 
the deal.

Losing 
to 
the 
Buckeyes 

at home on Saturday marks 
Michigan’s third loss to a top-10 
team in the last two weeks, after 
falling to No. 5 Penn State at 
home on Wednesday and at No. 
4 Nebraska on Oct. 10. But the 
team isn’t making excuses.

“We’re not happy with having 

tight matches with those teams,” 
Rosen said. “We want to beat 
those teams, and I think we’re 
good enough to beat those 
teams.”

Michigan’s Big Ten schedule 

doesn’t get any easier, and the 
Wolverines emphasized the need 
for a better, consistent team 
effort going forward. 

“One of our goals was to be 

balanced 
offensively,” 
Rosen 

said. “But I don’t think we got 
balanced production.” 

Michigan totaled a mediocre 

.173 team attack percentage for 
the match, compared with Ohio 
State’s mark of .269.

Two close losses in a row have 

the Wolverines looking forward 
to a week of practice before 
heading to Northwestern and 
Illinois this coming weekend. 
There they will look to do 
better late in sets, and improve 
upon their eighth-place Big Ten 
standing.

“We put ourselves in positions 

to win every set,” Rosen said. 
“Now we have to take that next 
step.”
