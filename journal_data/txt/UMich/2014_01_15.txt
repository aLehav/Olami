"Congratulations!"
Andrew Boland, a senior at
Rockford High School, located
about 200 miles west of Ann
Arbor, cracked a smile as he
read the first word of the e-mail
from University Admissions,
announcing his acceptance.
"I was really excited because
Michigan was the place that I've
always wanted to go," Boland
said. "It's a prestigious school,
it's where I want to be, and I'm
happy to be going there."
Boland was one of nearly
23,000 early action applicants,
marking a 4-percent increase
from last year's batch of pro-
spective students. Last year,
the University received about

22,000 early applicants - a
larger bump from the previous
19,000 early-action applicants.
Complete data detailing the
number of applicants admitted,
deferred and denied will not be
available until the admissions
process is complete.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director
of undergraduate admissions,
wrote in a statement that early
action gives applicants more
time to evaluate their prospec-
tive options - which may con-
tribute to its popularity.
"Applicants appreciate know-
ing about their admission sta-
tus before the semester break,"
Spencer wrote.
The University moved from
using a custom application to
the Common Application in
2010, resulting in a much larger
number of applicants, according
to Spencer.
"(It) makes it very conve-
nient for students to apply to
more than one of their top
choice schools," Spencer said.

Event begins
yearlong series of
commemorative
events, programs
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
Daily StaffReporter
The Center for the Educa-
tion of Women began a year-
long celebration of its 50th

anniversary with a screening
of short films by and about
women Tuesday evening. The
films were followed by a dis-
cussion with documentary
filmmaker Cynthia Wade, who
won a 2008 Academy Award
for "Freeheld."
Speaking to the crowd gath-
ered in the Michigan Theatre,
Christina Whitman, vice pro-
vost for academic and faculty
affairs, urged the generations
of supporters and benefactors

to solidify and expand on the
CEW's gains over the past 50
years.
When the CEW was estab-
lished in1964, it served women
who had come to Ann Arbor
with a spouse and were look-
ing to start or continue their
higher education. In the early
1960s, that desire came with
hurdles both within and out-
side of the University. Admis-
sions and hiring policies were
often still explicitly gender

biased, and balancing fam-
ily with a professional life was
difficult.
"It's hard to take seriously
in some ways the kind of views
in the 1960s about women, but
they were certainly very real at
the time," said Carol Hollens-
head, who was CEW's director
from 1988 to 2008.
During Hollenshead's time
at the CEW, the center advised
the University on policies

Speakers, student
ofgs. to pay tribute
to national hero
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Although the national holi-
day celebrating Martin Luther
King Jr.'s work only lasts one
day, the University's MLK Sym-
posium has scheduled a wide
variety of events that will last
throughout this month to com-
memorate King's legacy.
This year, the symposium's
theme focuses on the ideas of
how power, justice and love
operate in America, and how
ideas about them have changed
over time.
The symposium is orga-
nized through the University's
Office of Academic Multicul-
tural Initiatives and combines
the efforts of faculty, staff, stu-
dents and community members
to bring in speakers and host
discussions inspired by King's
ideals.

Lumas Helaire, assistant
director for the Office of Aca-
demic Multicultural tnitiatives
and chair of the MLK Sympo-
sium, said the theme "heal the
divide" arose when planners
discussed how King's work
evolved during the years before
he was assassinated.
Last year's symposium
focused on the 50th anniver-
sary of King's historic "I Have
A Dream" speech. This year
aims to address the subsequent
actions he took to fight racism
and injustice.
"King worked largely to
bridge the divide between dif-
ferent groups and races that
come from traumatic events
in history," Helaire said. "It's
great to be a part of something
that honors one of our national
heroes."
The event's website lists 19
different exhibitions, lectures,
discussions and a poetry slam,
all in celebration of the holi-
day. The program will begin on
Monday.

'U' protein research could
lead to better drug treatment

Professors study
how water affects
molecular functions
By TOM MCBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
Much like students at a club
on a Saturday night, proteins can
act differently when crowded
together than when they are
more spread out.
A team of University research-
ers is at the forefront of studying
this phenomenon as they focus on
how water acts between proteins
surrounded by bulky molecules,
known as crowded proteins. The
research may enable scientists to
better understand how proteins
work, which can lead to improved
drug treatments in the future.
The researchers' paper,
"Crowding Induced Collective
Hydration of Biological Macro-

molecules over Extended Dis-
tances," was recently published
in the Journal of the American
Chemical Society and is acces-
sible online.
Proteins called enzymes carry
out many crucial chemical reac-
tions in the body. They are often
studied in terms of the molecules
they bind to carry out these life-
sustaining reactions. However,
an aspect of protein chemistry
that has been overlooked is that
they are almost always acting in
crowded, watery environments.
Assistant Chemistry Prof.
Kevin Kubarych said crowded
environments can alter the way
in which we view protein activity.
"When you stuff people
together, like kids at a club - as
the walls of the club start to get
closer and closer together, the
music might be the same and the
dancing might be similar, but the
way that the actual motion of
people works through the club

is going to change. If you want to
go from here to there, you have
to mess with 25 people on your
way,"Kubarych said.
In the researchers' model,
crowding of proteins causes
the water surrounding them
to slow down. In keeping with
Kubarych's example, they have
less room to move in the club.
As a result, the proteins, which
normally fluctuate in shape, also
begin to slow down.
"If the solute is just protein,
that means that proteins are indi-
rectly sharing information with
each other through this attribute
of water," Kubarych said.
The information could have
important pharmaceutical and
medical implications. Each pro-
tein has very specific molecules
called substrates to which it
binds and on which it performs
certain actions. For example,
the protein salivary amylase,
present in human saliva, starts
breaking food apart as it's eaten.

Dr. Margaret R. Gyetko, senior associate dean for Faculty and Faculty Development at University Medical School, speaks
about promotions and tenure at the Towsley Center Tuesday.
Medical School hosts town
halls to talk pro-motion

I

,-S

Many important drugs work by
closely mimicking substrates
that proteins would normally
bind to, keeping them from bind-
ing to their normal substrates
and thus causing some change in
the body.
Exactly how well proteins bind
to their substrates and how quick-
8 ly this happens depends on a host
of factors, one of which may have
to do with the state of the water
surroundingthe protein.
Kubarych said crowding could
affect water molecules, which then
affects unbound proteins' fluctua-
tions, changing the way in which
theybind to their substrates.
Knowing more about how pro-
teins respond to crowding could
illuminate more about the speed
at which they bind to certain
drugs, which can be the differ-
ence between life and death in
some cases.
"Waiting for one or two days
7 for your drug to take effect -
that's only a factor of two in
chemistry but can make a huge
difference for a sick person,"
Kubarych said.

Meetings address
issues from dean's
annual speech
By CAROLINE BARON
For the Daily
Even doctors need a reminder
that in order to succeed, you have
to ask for what you want.
Margaret Gyetko, the senior
associate dean for faculty and
faculty development at the Uni-
versity Medical School, held a
seminar Tuesday to address the
ways that the Medical School's
faculty members can best earn
promotions and tenure.
The meeting was part of a
series hostedby the school's dean,
James Woolliscroft, as a way to
promote interaction between the
Medical School community and
its leadership. The series of town
halls supplement issues raised in
Woolliscroft's State of the School

presentation, which was held in
September.
Thiseventwas Gyetko'sseventh
seminar on the topic. The idea for
the series first emerged after she
received large numbers of poorly
prepared promotion packages
from the school's faculty.
"I had been getting a lot of
applications where it was very
clear to me that (the applicants)
were smart and talented, but they
didn't know how to plan ahead in
a waybest conducive to achieving
promotions," Gyetko said. "You
know, we have an amazing and
brilliant faculty, but the only way
to win the game is to know the
rules, and know if you're ahead or
behind."
The seminar focused on what
aspects are most valued and scru-
tinized by the school's leadership
when making decisions about
promotions of faculty members.
Gyetko's talk focused on differ-
ent ways that faculty could pre-
pare their promotion packages to

make themselves mostappealing,
as well as the types of goals they
try to achieve that would make
them ideal candidates for a pro-
motion in the future.
Gyetko added that the timeline
to obtain a promotion is long and
cannot be rushed in the five years
before a faculty member requests
career advancement. She also
said it's important for faculty
to understand that moving up
is natural and that they should
strive for it.
During the seminar, Gyetko
said she recommends cultivating
relationships with people in the
same field, following through on
promises and ensuring prepared-
ness for the added responsibili-
ties that accompany a promotion.
She also drew attention to a pro-
gram available at the Medical
School to help facultyassess their
readiness before beginning to
prepare promotion packages.
The entire lecture is available
for viewing on the UMHS website.

to raise $20 million during the
campaign. Patel is the chairman
of the school's board dedicated
to fundraising development.
"It's a small college, and so
the $20 million is quite sig-
nificant, and I think we have
enough people helping us that
we should be able to meet
our target," Patel said. "I am
pleased to be a part of the col-
lege and do whatever we can."
Patel said he hopes to main-
tain a cycle of donations
through graduate students
receiving his scholarships.
"We're just hoping that the
most deserving students will
get it and that, at some point,
once they are successful, they

will pay back to the college," he
said.
Patel was born and raised
in Africa and completed his
undergraduate degree in India.
He then finished his studies
at the University's Pharmacy
School, where he received his
doctorate in 1979. He currently
resides in Salt Lake City, Utah,
and works as a venture capital-
ist with his company, vSpring
Capital.
Patel said he has fond memo-
ries of his time spent in Ann
Arbor and appreciated the
wealth of activities available
to him along with the unique
educational experience that the
University offered.
"Without going to Michigan I
would not have been able to get
where I am, so I feel it's impor-
tant to help other students to

get their education," he said..
Peter Niedbala, the college's
director of pharmacy advance-
ment and external relations,
said Patel's contributions were
to the school have been incred-
ibly generous.
"He is really contributing
not only resources but also time
as chairman of our campaign
efforts, and it's very humbling
that he has made this time com-
mitment to the college," Nied-
bala said. "He is helping focus
our volunteer board on iden-
tifying prospects and helping
create enthusiasm for helping
the college achieve its goal."
In addition, Patel has been
recognized in the past with
the University's Distinguished
Alumni Award in 2009 and
the Willem J. Kolff Lifetime

Achievement Award in 2013.
Pharmacy student Ronak
Shah said the Patel Fellow-
ships are currently funding
his tuition and other college
expenses.
"This will help the Universi-
ty to go ahead in the future and
truly becoming one of the lead-
ers in the field of research and
academia," Shah said.
BioUtah president and CEO
Kimball Thomson, who knows
Patel through his membership
on BioUtah's board of directors,
praised his contributions to the
community.
"...He is a giver and a genu-
ine great man," Thomson said.
"He gives so much of himself to
others and to the community.
He really is one of the modern
fathers of biotechnology here in
the Western states."

regarding having parents as
students since many women
were returning to the class-
room almost immediately after
having children. Achieving
tenure was difficult for women
whose careers were interrupt-
ed by starting a family, as the
time requirement for attaining
tenure did not allow extended
maternity leave. The University
changed these policies in the
1990s, a time when few other
universities were taking steps
to accommodate these situa-
tions, according to Hollens-
head.
But Hollenshead said those
changes took much longer than
she had hoped.
"If you had asked me then,
in 1970, 'Where will you be in
2013?' I would've said 'Oh, it'll
all be solved!" she said.
CEW's current director, Glo-
ria Thomas, said it is obvious
that gains for women have not
been equal across the board.
According to the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics between
1979 and 2012, white women's
earnings rose 31 percent while
earnings for Black and His-
panic women only rose 20 and

13 percent, respectively. Data
from the 2012 Current Popula-
tion Survey showed that women
with children earned less than
their childless counterparts,
while men with children
earned significantly more than
their peers.
Consequently, the CEW's
constituency has diversified
tremendously since its incep-
tion when it served mostly
white, middle-class women,
Thomas said. Today, the CEW
offers career counseling and
networking help to a demo-
graphic that includes many
women of color, women living
in low-income situations, single
parents and some men.
"There is still a need - maybe
not as much need for white,
middle-class women - but still
a need for those who are strug-
gling to get to where they want
to be in their careers and in
their education," Thomas said.
She added that the CEW's
role today is to help those who
still face barriers to higher edu-
cation make sure they are not
"doomed to a low-income job."
As tuition rates steadily climb,
financial realities often make a
college education unattainable
for many women and men.
In response, the CEW gives
away $300,000 per year in

scholarships to "non-tradition-
al students," including parents,
those who are transferring
from community college or are
not financially supported by
their family.
"Not all women live the tra-
ditional lives where they come
right out of high school and get
their education and have 2.5
children and all that," Thomas
said.
The CEW Scholarship Pro-
gram awards aid to 50 students
across the three University
campuses every year.
"It's not just needing the
money," Thomas added. "It's
connecting them to a network
of individuals who will sup-
port their efforts as they pursue
their career interests."
It's that network that drew
Thomas back to Ann Arbor
when she took the CEW direc-
torship in 2008. She originally
started working at the Center
in 1995 as a graduate student at
the School of Education.
"It was, in many respects,
a home away from home for
me when I was a grad student
here," she said.
The CEW will continue to
celebrate its semicentennial
throughout the year with a
conference focused on eco-
nomic security and mobility for

women in poverty in May and
an event to bring together past
and current scholarship recipi-
ents in the fall.
The center originally invited
Alice Walker, the Pulitzer Prize
winning author of "The Color
Purple," to speak at one of the
anniversary's events, but later
rescinded the invitation. The
center decided Walker was "not
the premium choice" for the
event, according to Thomas.
The author posted a letter
allegedly written by her agent
that said funding was cut from
her lecture due to controversial
statements she made about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
However, the University later
invited Walker to speak at the
biennial Zora Neale Hurston
Lecture for the Department
of Afroamerican and African
Studies, to be held in November
2014.
Walker accepted the invita-
tion on her blog and forgave the
University for the uncertain
circumstances.
"I believe we have all learned
something from our efforts to
reach out to one another, and
I believe also that - if solar
flares or deeply unintelligent
wars haven't carried us off -
it will be a good time," Walker
wrote.

APPLICANTS
From Page 1A
"This sometimes generates more
choices and variables to take into
account than in previous years."
Erica Sanders, manag-
ing director of undergraduate
admissions, said in an e-mail
interview last year that the
increasing magnitude of appli-
cants might yield more Early
Action deferrals.
While some students, like
Boland, opened e-mails welcom-

ingthem to the University's class
of 2018, others were not as fortu-
nate.
"Our high application volume,
coupled with the very strong
credentials of our applicants in
recent years, has contributed
to an increasingly competitive
admissions process," the deferral
letter reads. "As a result, we are
writing to inform you that your
application is currently being
deferred for further review."
According to the letter, all
final admissions decisions will
be released no later than April.

don, who worked in DPE as
a students, shared stories
from his time at the Univer-
sity as a gay man of color and
working with students in the
Oxford Residence Hall. Gor-
don stressed the importance of
cherishing others in one's origi-
nality and building friendships
when trying to create a safe
community.
Gordon described his peers

in the DPE as "a group so fierce
even Beyonce would be jeal-
ous," and added how impor-
tant the friendships within this
community are to being suc-
cessful in their mission.
"One day you soon you'll
come to realize how powerful
this program really is," he said.
"Created in the image of the
great Robbie Ransom, the DPE
is bold and unapologetic in its
pursuit of social justice."
Gordon said the DPE is one
of the only programs on campus
that gives positions of power to

typically marginalized groups
such as LGBTQ students, people
of color and international stu-
dents. He added that students
should realize the importance
of being good to yourself, to
respecting the work you do and
to being willing to compromise.
Trey Boynton, director of
diversity and inclusion, also
spoke of the DPE's significance
and impact in the program,
adding that the group saves
lives and sends a strong mes-
sage to members in the Univer-
sity community.

"We need it more than ever,"
Boynton said. "DPE is housing's
manifestation of our commit-
ment to diversity."
Robbie Ransom, former
director of cultural awareness
and diversity education, also
spoke after receiving recogni-
tion from current DPE mem-
bers. Ransom encouraged the
DPE members to keep on fight-
ing for social justice, even after
graduation.

First meeting of
the year addresses
administration's
transparency
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In a unanimous vote Tues-
day night, the Central Stu-
dent Government Assembly
passed a resolution that called
on the administration to grant
the elected body the power to
screen all proposed amend-
ments to the University's State-
ment of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
The resolution will now go to
the Student Relations Advisory
Committee for approval. The
SRAC will hold a formal vote on
each of the resolution's stated
recommendations in February.
The measures approved by
SRAC will then be sent to E.
Royster Harper, vice president
for student life, who - if all
goes according to plan - will
pass them to the University's
Office of General Counsel, and
ultimately to University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman for
final consent.
Law student Jeremy Keeney,
CSG student general counsel,
said the proposed modifica-
tions would begin to fix the cur-

rent system, which allows the
office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution and faculty to propose
amendments to the Statement
of Student Rights and Respon-
sibilities without CSG approval.
This process could allow for
changes to be made to the stu-
dent Code of Conduct without
students' consent or input.
"I'm hoping (the resolution)
will be successful," Keeney
said. "We provided Royster and
the chair of SRAC a copy of this
in December. They did reach
out with some clarifying ques-
tions, but not with concerns."
The CSG resolutions com-
mittee will now consider sub-
stantive changes to the Code of
Conduct itself, targeting poten-
tial discrepancies between the
CSG Bill of Student Rights and
the statement's list of rights and
responsibilities.
A new resolution proposing
amendments to students' rights
will go up for vote in the assem-
bly by February 4, Keeney said.
"The combination of these
(resolutions) will be one of the
biggest amendments that have
been passed in a while," he
added.
The efforts to standard-
ize the Code of Conduct are
not CSG's only initiatives to
increase administration trans-
parency. Keeney and Chris
Stevens, Chief Justice of the
Central Student Judiciary, have

also been working to improve
University honor codes since
last semester.
The two have met with
administrators - including
Harper and University Provost
Martha Pollack - to address
code inconsistencies. Right
now, each unit within the Uni-
versity has its own honor code
with varying levels of detail
among the University's schools
and colleges. Although Kee-
ney and Stevens do not wish
to change the organization of
codes by school, they agreed
that they want to increase
transparency and consistency
among the codes.
Keeney said he recently sat
in on two LSA honor code hear-
ings with the permission of
Esrold Nurse, assistant dean for
undergraduate education. He
was impressed with the impar-
tiality with which the dean
conducted himself, but he felt
the students weren't aware they
could have an advocate present
to help present their cases.
"It's not clear what the rights
are and what the process should
be," Stevens said.
The College of Engineering,
for instance, has a procedural
manual for its hearings - but
Stevens said it is not published.
"Personally, I found the sys-
tem to be unfair, at least at the
student-peer level," he said. "It
just seems that the cards are

stacked (against students)."
Keeney and Stevens said
honor code reform would also
benefit the administration by
preventing any litigation stem-
ming from wrongful expulsions
or suspensions.
The pair researched the
honor codes of the University of
California, Berkeley, Princeton,
Yale and Stanford, and has four
principal changes they think
should be adopted. First, they
recommend that honor code
hearings should include written
opinions by the administration.
Additionally, they said they
believe students should have
access to both advocates and
hearing procedures, including
appellate rules. They added that
all honor codes should be easily
available online.
As per Pollack's recommen-
dation, Keeney and Stevens will
meet with a group comprised
of all the University's associ-
ate deans and vice provosts
next week to initiate discussion
of reform, and to potentially
establish a working relationship
with the group for the rest of
the year. The meeting will be
the first of its kind.
"Academic integrity is
extremely important, and I
welcome the fact CSG is think-
ing about our policies," Pollack
wrote in a statement. "I will
be interested to see how their
work progresses."

Immunizing Michigan
The University should require vaccinations for the safety of students
With the recent outbreaks of influenza in Michigan and across
the country, the importance of early prevention has come to
the forefront of public conversation. Healthful practices and
safety precautions are being offered as possible solutions, but one of the
most effective solutions - namely, vaccination - does not get the attention
it deserves from University health officials. Vaccinations save the lives of
millions of people every year by safely and efficiently protecting against
myriad diseases. Their proven effectiveness stands starkly against the
University's lackluster vaccination program. The University must improve
its vaccination requirements and its vaccination-promotion program as a
whole for the health and safety of its students.

Between guest speakers and con-

appears to be very socially con-

we actually accomplishing anything
with these deliberate and evident
acts of empathy?
A few years ago, Malcolm
Gladwell wrote an article called
"Small Change: Why the revolution
will not be tweeted." Besides my
inexplicable addiction to both Mal-
colm Gladwell and Twitter, there
are a few reasons this article caught
my attention. Gladwell discusses
how, with the increasing popular-
ity of social media, we are losing
sight of true activism. Being physi-
cally present is what sparked great
movements, not simply showing
support through tweets and sharing
links on Facebook. Looking back on
movements that inspire me - most
notably the Civil Rights Movement
- college students just like us were
able to organize nationwide, with-
out any previous communication.
Rather, pure passion and a need for
change drove them.

Vaccines work. The absence of diseases like
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles,
mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, meningitis and
varicella from everyday life is a direct benefit
of laws requiring children to be vaccinated as a
condition for entering public education. Public
education, and specifically public higher edu-
cation, fosters areas of close contact, exchange
and collaboration - the same kinds of areas
where diseases are often most communicable.
Preventative measures should be put in place to
ensure the well-being of all participants.
Diseases and infections such as influenza,
meningitis, hepatitis B and human papillo-
mavirus have an elevated risk of incidence in
college environments due to students' close
and continual contact with one another. Yet
Michigan's higher education system does not
require domestic students to show proof of
vaccination upon acceptance - though some
international students are required to be test-
ed for tuberculosis.
Many other schools across the nation require
vaccinations as a condition of enrollment,
includingthe University of California, Berkeley
for hepatitis B and the University of Texas for
bacterial meningitis. In both instances, a state
mandate compelstheuniversitiesto adoptthese
standards, with the Texas legislation going so

far as to enforce the requirement for all higher
education institutions, public or private. While
Michigan's K-12 vaccination program is compa-
rable to the rest of the country's as a result of
federal guidelines, it is woefullybehind inother
areas where vaccinations are necessary. Hospi-
tal employees, ambulatory care physicians and
correctional inmates are not required in any
way to be vaccinated for any disease.
While at times on the leading edge of mod-
ern vaccination legislation, Michigan's overall
hands-off approach to vaccination regulation
in higher education has left many of its student-
citizens susceptible. While direct, state-based
legislative action might be the preferred route
to improve the state's overall vaccination poli-
cies, the University must do more - if not by
state mandate then on its own - to show con-
cern for the welfare of its students. At the very
least, the University must increase the aware-
ness and the availability of vaccines for its stu-
dents, staff and faculty.
Students should be protected and feel safe
from the dangerous diseases that are easily
spread. One of the easiest and most effective
ways to do this is to emphasize preventative
health neasures and make them available.Vac-
cines savelives, and with the proper promotion
and standards, so too will the University.

Changing, the conversation

Charity is a quick fix

The holidays are officially over. Wrapping
paper lies in the bottom of trashcans. Presents
are worn in. Netflix is no longer the main event
of the day. And tiredness once again looms
amongstressed students.
But other things are also becoming old
and remain stuck in the past. The Salvation
Army's red kettles and jingling bells have been
removed. Collection boxes with the "Toys for
Tots" label have been dismantled. Piles of cans
have been delivered, and none remain. But peo-
ple are still hungry. Children still need warmth
and toys. Loose change burns a hole in one's
pocket very quickly. The holidays are winding
down, and so are acts of charity.
Charity is a quick fix. During the holidays,
donation boxes are overflowing, but once the
Christmas trees have been thrown away and
the twinkling lights have been turned off, dona-
tions halt. Such acts of kindness do little to rem-
edythe real issue. Theyare veryvertical actions
- the top gives to the bottom. There is no soli-
darity. There is no collaboration. Solutions are
seen as coming from positions of privilege, and
oftentimes they are not solutions at all, but
actually overlook the real issue. The amount
that is donated is never toomuch. Loose change
and old toys are appropriate, because the lost
weight will not be felt. Charity inevitably views
some as helpless receivers and others as selfless
saviors. It dictates that some have the answers
and the means to implement them while others
remain powerless. Never through charity can
we move beyond privilege and these problem-
atic dynamics.
I believe in a common liberation. I believe in
solidarity. We all have something to give and
receive from others despite the intersection of
our identities. As allies, we can move forward
to solve the issues of why hunger and poverty
exist. Charity turns us into opposite poles
and slaps a small Band-Aid on a wound that is
much bigger. Moving from problematic char-
ity to powerful solidarity means making some
changes first.
Change the narrative. "Help" should not be
solely defined as giving tangible resources that
cover basic needs. This definition limits us
to viewing help as stemming only from those
with material resources and not from those
who lack the necessary funds. Instead of con-
fining ourselves to this idea of help, we should
move toward entertaining the idea of empow-
erment. Empowerment comes in many forms
and shades. It dictates that each person and
community is equally part of the equation. It
gives a voice to all and wards off the potential of

disseminating norms and solutions of the privi-
leged group onto others.
We also need to change the idea of who is a
receiver. Each community, including my priv-
ileged, white community lined with picket
fences and green lawns, needs empowerment.
Empowerment does not mean that only the
less privileged need attention, or that they
lack ability and knowledge. My privileged
community needs empowerment to gain a
consciousness it currently lacks. Such com-
munities need the strength to echo the truth
and unearth the unjust structures they rely
on. Other communities and individuals may
need empoweriment to unlock their voices,
reach for their potential and gain a positive
self-image. By empowering and attending to
everyone's different needs, we can change the
equation. We all become an equally important
component of the solution through which we
have the potential to learn, empower, listen
and influence.
To do that, we must create intersectional-
ity. Issues are interwoven. People do not fit
into boxed categories, and our problems are
not individual entities. Therefore, we cannot
approach liberation without turning it into a
common fight. Even though my white skin does
not make me a target, I still need to be liberated
from privilege and need my friends and allies
to be liberated from oppression. Together we
are stronger.
We can come together and link hands. Char-
ity allows people to give to others without even
meeting the people they are supposedly help-
ing. The distance between "givers" and "receiv-
ers" prevents any true warmth, compassion or
care from forming. We cannot create change
without nurturing genuine relationships. By
meeting the people we hope to collaborate
with, we can find the love we need to become
braver fighters.
Make giving a part of yourself: Charity dic-
tates giving as a concrete and singular act.
Food, money, toys and clothes are donated
once in a while, and then the act is over. Don't
give only when it is convenient for you. Taking
the steps to form solidarity and to empower
others as well as yourself means turning these
acts into an essence of yourself. Solidarity is a
state of being. It radiates outwaird and influ-
ences our actions at every moment.
It is time for us to create real change. It is
time to create solidarity and begin a true fight
for liberation. Come join.

n Jan. 3, Rolling Stone
published an article titled
"Five Economic Reforms
Millennials
Should Be Fight-
ing For," and
it's been circu-
lating around
the Internet
ever since. The
writer, Jesse h
Myersons, called
for five of what DEREK
can only be WOLFE
described as "a _
shade short of
Marx" reforms:
Guarantee work for everybody, give
social security to all, take back the
land, make everything owned by
everybody and create a public bank
in every state.
"The economy blows," he wrote.
"Unemployment blows ... so do jobs."
"Ever noticed how much land-
lords blow?" he questioned.
"Hoarders blow." And so does
Wall Street, according to him -- and
just about everyone, really.
Coming from a writer whose
Twitter bio includes #FULLCOM-
MUNISM, it should be to no one's
surprise that he thinks this way.
And it also shouldn't be surprising
that the article has been blasted
across all forms of media over the
past couple of weeks - especially by
conservatives, but not exclusively.
The reforms have been called
"tired, old 'solutions."' Of course
they are. History has shown that
this kind of economy does not
work and will never work. But that
doesn't mean there is nothing to be
learned from this not-so-eloquently
written piece that was clearly pub-

Afghan wilderness with only
limited radio contact with
American forces, the soldiers
are left with no choice but to
fight for survival.
The intense and lengthy-.
action sequence that follows
excellently portrays a sense of
desperation as well the Navy
SEALs' astounding ability to
endure massive punishment.
This echoes the film's open-
ing where actual footage of the
Navy SEALs' extreme training
establishes the theme of will-
power and a tone of realism.
During the combat, a highly
subjective and frenetic camera
conveys the hysteria that ensues
as the Taliban militia forces
them to retreat further and fur-
ther down the mountain. The
sound effects induce flinching
with every impact. Audiences

also receive close-ups of the
SEALs' gruesome wounds.
Initially, the film comes off
like any other film with an
excess of shooting and explo-
sions, but a dearth of unique
emotionality. "Lone Survivor"
glorifies the heroes and their
deaths while unceremoniously
dispatching a number of name-
less, faceless "bad guys." How-
ever, the film takes a surprising
turn, in a moment that human-
izes the Afghanis and imparts
to the audience a wonderful
sense of hope for the prevalence
of human kindness.
Possibly the film's stron-
gest asset is the accuracy with
which it depicts the story based
off of the accounts of the lone
survivor himself, Marcus Lut-
trell. Though Hollywood does
of course fudge some of the
more minor details, the events
that resonate most with the
audience stay fairly true to real
world events. In this regard,
"Lone Survivor" inspires and
entertains without turning the
phrase "based on a true story"
into a meaningless marketing
gimmick.
While "Lone Survivor" may
recycle the familiar themes of
patriotism, honor in war and
personal sacrifice, its dedica-
tion to the real-life heroes of
Operation Red Wings reminds
viewers of the true value of
these principles.

viewers to care as much about

Since "True Detective" will be
an anthology drama, following
the same characters and case for
one season before switching to a
new set of detectives and mur-

the investigation is the weakest

Despite these shortcomings,

enough to reopen the case and

Loo sely spun Helix' falters

By ALEX INTNER
Daily Arts Writer
When the names of certain
showrunners are attached to a
series, there are expectations
that natu-
rally follow.
Ron Moore
("Battle- Helix
star Galac-
tica") is one Season One
of those Premiere
names.
Bringing Friday ati10 p.m.
him in as SyFy
a producer
adds a cer-
tain ethos to "Helix." While
he will probably never be
involved with another show as
great as "Battlestar," his name
still means something in the
science-fiction community.
"Helix" follows what hap-
pens after a virus breaks out
in a research facility in the
Arctic. A team from the Cen-
ter for Disease Control arrives
and finds themselves facing
a type of virus they've never
seen before. Over the course
of the first three hours, the
show introduces the outbreak
and adds some major details
about how this virus works. It
spends these hours assembling
a chessboard, setting the board
by introducing the characters
and moving the pieces around.
The major issue is that the
movements around the board

are slight. The show doesn't
create a huge amount of for-
ward momentum in its sto-
rytelling. The second hour
especially made it clear that
the show is stalling as it tries
to fill 13 episodes of story. If
this season were six or even 10
episodes, the story would be
less redundant. It spends a sig-
nificant amount of time on the
effects of the virus, especially
the transformation of certain
people into zombie-like crea-
tures called "Vectors." After
introducing that idea, it con-
tinues to discuss it without
giving new information. It
starts to be repetitive, rather
than pushing the plot forward.
It doesn't help that "Helix"
's characters are a mixed bag
as well. Only the two main
characters, Dr. Alan Farragut
(Billy Campbell, "The Kill-
ing"), who is the head of the
CDC's team and Dr. Hiroshi
Hatake (Hiroyuki Sanada,
"Lost"), who is the head of the
research facility, seem com-
plex. They are the only char-
acters who show any signs of
change or emotion over the
course of the first few hours.
Given that the show actually
has a decent sized ensemble,
that's a problem. This is some-
thing that can change over the
course of the season, but as
of right now, it's a huge mark
against the show.
The most effective element

of "Helix" is the setting. The
research facility is in the Arc-
tic, completely separated from
the rest of the world. (They
only can contact the outside
world for an hour a day.) This
creates a claustrophobic feel-
ing that makes the virus out-
break seem even more real.
When the Vectors are loose
and attacking people in the
facility, it creates some genu-
inely scary moments. The
show uses its setting to put
the viewers in the characters'
First episodes

minds, allowing them to feel
the same fear.
"Helix" appears to be anoth-
er mediocre serialized sci-
ence-fiction series. Its setting
allows it to create some strong
moments, but it's limited by
its weak group of supporting
characters and lack of narra-
tive momentum. Ron Moore is
a quality writer; if there's any-
one who can correct the show's
direction, it's him. However,
the first few episodes don't
show strong vital signs.

Syrian refugees in Lebanon
struggle to find aid in cold

Little Rock Central High.
Equal access to education
improves in Little Rock

Racial divides
remain nationwide,
but integration
efforts intensify
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP)
- Five decades and $1 billion
after an infamous racial epi-
sode made Little Rock, Ark., a
national symbol of school segre-
gation, the legal fight to ensure
that all of its children receive
equal access to education is
almost over.
But many challenges still
remain, in Little Rock and
across the country.
Some of the city's affluent
white neighborhoods have bet-
ter schools. The district's black
students on average have lower
grades and test scores and more
disciplinary problems than
white students. And racial divi-
sions linger within the integrat-
ed Central High School, where
riots erupted in 1957 as Gov.
Orval Faubus tried to prevent
black students from entering.
A dayafter alkey desegrega-
tion lawsuit was settled, such
stubborn disparities raised the
question: Do all children in
Little Rock now receive a high-
quality education?
"No," said Joel E. Anderson,

chancellor of the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock, who
led a task force that produced a
1997 report on the future of the
city's public schools.
"The plaintiffs in the law-
suit and school district officials
have all made a monumental
effort to achieve equal educa-
tional access for all children in
the district, but there is still a
considerable distance to go,"
Anderson said by email.
He said that the opening
statement of the report still
stands: If the people fighting for
equality in 1957 could look ahead
to the current Little Rock School
District, "they almost certainly
would have said, 'No, that is not
what we are seeking."'
Monday's settlement estab-
lished an end date for $70 mil-
lion in annual state payments
that fund desegregation efforts,
including programs that offer
poor black students better oppor-
tunities and attract affluent
white students into the district.
The extra fundinghas helped
make Central High School
one of the nation's best public
schools. Its-advanced classes
serve as a major draw for white
students who live far from cam-
pus and make it the flagship
school for the city, if not all of
Arkansas.
"We produce more nationally

recognized scholars than any
part of the state," Superinten-
dent Dexter Suggs said Tuesday.
But at middle schools with a
higher percentage of black stu-
dents, twice as many students
score "below basic" on stan-
dardized math tests at the end
of eighth grade - a pattern that
repeats across grades and sub-
jects.
Data from the state Education
Department that tracked stu-
dents between their high school
years and their first year of col-
lege showed that students from
the area's private high schools
were better prepared for college
and scored higher on the ACT
college entrance exam. Using
data from 2011, the most recent
year available, all but one private
school had at least a quarter of
its students meet all of the ACT's
pre-college benchmarks.
No public school in the coun-
ty reached that mark - not even
Central - and the schools that
had the highest percentage of
black students fared worst on
the test, with less than 6 per-
cent of its graduates ready for
college.
"The problem is not solved
yet," said John Kirk, chairman
of the history department at the
University of Arkansas at Little
Rock, who has studied the his-
tory of desegregation in the city.

Increasingly chaotic
security situation
overwhelms relief
organizations
ZAHLEH, Lebanon (AP)
- Fear, confusion and a lack
of information are preventing
many Syrian refugees in Leba-
non from knowing where to
turn for aid.
With a constant surge of
refugees now fighting the bit-
ter winter cold, humanitarian
organizations are struggling to
find ways to reach them with the
information they need to sur-
vive - and are recruiting some
refugees to help out.
In Lebanon, where displaced
Syrians now equal one-third
of the population, the problem
is made worse by the govern-
ment's refusal to establish offi-
cial refugee camps, leading to
a chaotic, fractured operation
with major gaps in coordina-
tion.
Many distrust a Lebanese
government they deem sym-
pathetic to President Bashar
Assad and are suspicious of
international aid organiza-
tions, making them hesitant to
register with the U.N. refugee
agency to become eligible for
assistance.
"Everyone, who comes here is
confused and afraid," said Elyse
Maalouf, a UNHCR worker in
Zahleh, one of two registration
centers in Lebanon's Bekaa Val-
ley, where hundreds of infor-
mal refugee settlements have
sprung up. "Many refugees are
reluctant to register because
they fear their names would be
shared with the Syrian govern-
ment."
Of all of Syria's neighbors,
Lebanon has been the hard-
est hit by the exodus of Syrians
fleeing their country's violence.
Close to 1.5 million Syrians
are now in Lebanon, scattered
across the volatile country
often in makeshift substan-
dard accommodation. Unlike
in neighboring Turkey and Jor-
dan, there are no official refugee
camps.

other health services, to educa-
tion and even basic aid to sur-
vive outside their war-stricken
homeland, most Syrians in
Lebanon feel lost in a world of
rumors and misinformation.
"Managing and disseminat-
ing information becomes much
more of a challenge than it
would have been if they were
in a camp setting," said Ninette
Kelley, UNHCR representative
in Lebanon.
A donors' conference for
Syria is set to open in Kuwait
on Wednesday. The U.N. last
month appealed for a staggering
$6.5 billion to cover this year's
funding needs - its largest-ever
request for a single crisis.
Experts say more money
needs to be allocated for infor-
mation programs, crucial to any
successful aid response.
"Information saves lives, and
a significant part of what we
have to do is advocate to funders
and donors that this actually is
a tremendous need," said Kir-
patrick Day of the International
Rescue Committee.
In an effort to deal with the
massive aid effort, U.N. agen-
cies and NGOs have concen-
trated their operations under
the "Inter-agency Information
Sharing Portal," where the work
of various groups can be fol-
lowed.
But with each having its own
organizational mandate and the
geographic scatter of the refu-
gees, the effort has remained
largely uncoordinated.
Unregistered refugees, par-
ticularly in far-flung corners of
the country, are often left out
in the cold - literally - with no
access to aid except from sym-
pathetic locals. Surveys have
found few listen to the radio and
even fewer watch TV. Internet
and social media does not come
into play when it comes to needy
Syrians.
A recent survey by the glob-
al media development agency
Internews found 60 percent
of refugees cited their main
trusted source of informa-
tion as being "another person,
friend, family." Text messages
on mobile phones are often the
most advanced tools to reach
refugees with information such


as polio vaccination dates and
locations.
"When it comes to Syria, it's
really back to basics," Kelley
said.
To deal with the problem, aid
agencies have started to train
and recruit refugees as vol-
unteers, not only to distribute
information to fellow Syrians
but also to provide important
feedback. UNHCR used 100 vol-
unteers last year and is planning
to increase that to 1,000 next
year.
"Refugees often trust those
with whom they live, and this
is a great way to keep refugees
informed appropriately through
mediums that they have confi-
dence in," Kelley said.
Others are struggling to come
up with ways reach Syrians.
Internews recently partnered
with the International Rescue
Committee for a project called
Tawasul - Arabic for Connec-
tion. The project, still in the
preliminary stages, aims to find
innovative ways to get informa-
tion out.
"One of the things that we
feel is a pressing need that has
largely gone unmet is access to
information from sources that
people in the midst of the con-
flict can trust," said Day, the
project leader at ICR.
The U.N. has put the total
number of people in need of
humanitarian aid at 9.3 million.
They include some 2.3 million
Syrians who have fled the coun-
try, flooding neighbors such as
Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon,
which can barely keep up with
the strain.
At the UNHCR center in the
town of Zahleh in eastern Leb-
anon's Bekaa Valley, Syrians
stood in long lines in the biting
cold, waiting to register as refu-
gees.
"Nobody tells us what is hap-
pening," said Hajj Khater, an
elderly man from Syria's war-
shattered northern province of
Aleppo. "I registered a month
and a half ago. We were sup-
posed to start getting assistance
after 20 days but we're still
waiting, God only knows why,"
he said, drawing his red-and-
white checkered scarf closer to
his face from the cold.

Rouhani calls
Geneva agreement a
surrender of
Western nations
VIENNA (AP) - As diplomats
worked on the next step of imple-
menting a landmark Iran nuclear
deal, the country's president
described it Tuesday as a "sur-
render" of Western powers to
Tehran's demands.
But the U.S. dismissed the
comment as playing to a home
audience and urged Iran to abide
by the deal.
The Nov. 24 agreement com-
mits Tehran to curb its nuclear
programs in exchange for initial
sanctions relief over six months
as the two sides work toward
a permanent agreement. The
accord designates the U.N.'s
International Atomic Energy
Agency to supervise Iranian
compliance with terms of the
deal.
The 35-nation IAEA board is
expected to approve that role at a
meetingset for Jan.24, according
to two diplomats. They demand-
ed anonymity because they were
not authorized to disclose the
date ahead of an official IAEA
announcement.
Iranian officials have been
keen to portray the pact as advan-
tageous to their country in easing
sanctions in return for what they
say are minimal nuclear conces-
sions.
Iranian President Hassan
Rouhani's remarks about the
accord Tuesday appeared to be
part of efforts to bring around

hard-liners who have denounced
the deal, claiming it tramples on
Iran's nuclear rights.
"Do you know what the Gene-
va agreement means? It means
the surrender of the big powers
before the great Iranian nation,"
Rouhani told a crowd in the oil-
rich province of Khuzestan.
"The Geneva agreement
means the wall of sanctions has
broken. The unfair sanctions
were imposed on the revered and
peace-loving Iranian nation,"
he said. "It means an admission
by the world of Iran's peaceful
nuclear program."
Rouhani's comments drew a
dismissive U.S. response.
"It doesn't matter what they
say," White House spokes-
man Jay Carney told reporters
in Washington, describing the
statement as meant for a "domes-
tic audience."
"What matters to us ... is what
Iranian leaders do, what Iran
does in keeping its commitments
in this agreement," said Carney.
The U.N. agency did not con-
firm the board meeting but said
separate talks in Tehran between
Iran and IAEA experts were
postponed from Jan. 21 to Feb. 8.
One of the diplomats said the
Iran-IAEA talks were postponed
to allow Iran and the agency to
prepare for the implementation
of the Nov. 24 deal - a view the
United States appeared to share.
"There's a lot going on around
the same time," said Deputy
State Department Spokeswoman
Marie Harf. "So it's not a con-
cern."
Enactment of the Nov. 24
agreement is scheduled to begin
Jan. 20.

There's a great deal of tradi-
tion packed into that house, but
the first thing you see when you
walk up to that snowy home off
Woodward Avenue is John Wan-
gler. Not John Wangler in the
Rose Bowl, not John Wangler to
Anthony Carter, not that John
Wangler. They're the same per-
son, but this John Wangler stands
on his sidewalk, shovelingsnow.
"Hi, I'm John," he says, as if
you don't already know who he is.
For this John Wangler, there is
life after football, and for his kids,
that's all he can ask. Of his five
children, daughter Halle plays
basketball for Michigan, son Jack
is a freshman wide receiver and
son Jared is committed to play
linebacker there next year.
John played for Michigan
from 1976-1980, winning four Big
Ten championships and leading
the team to the 1981 Rose Bowl
championship.

early, talked ofvisiting elsewhere.
Wangler said he loved Penn
State when he visited, and his
high school coach felt the same
way. But something still didn't
seem quite right.
"Yougounderneaththe Christ-
mas tree, and you get a new truck
when you're a little kid, and you
go, 'Wow, that's really cool,' but
all along you wanted that bike,
your first bike," said Paul Verska,
Jared's coach at Warren (Mich.)
De La Salle. "You didn't think
you got it, and then the next day
you went underneath the Christ-
mas tree, and you go, 'Oh my God,
Santa brought me that bike."'
Wangler committed to
the Nittany Lions to .play for
former coach Bill O'Brien and
former linebackers coach Ron
Vanderlinden.
He said only the Wolverines
could have lured him away once
he committed.
Once the Wolverines started
recruiting him, things proceeded
quickly, and Jared fell in love
with Michigan all over again. He
walked through the facilities and
saw his dad's name in Rose Bowl
team pictures.
"When I did, it was too hard to
say no," Jared said.
He sat down with defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison to look
at the depth chart. Originally, the
Wolverines planned on landing
three linebackers - inside line-
backer Michael Ferns, inside line-
backer Noah Furbush and outside
linebacker Chase Winovich.
When they decided to recruit
four linebackers, they recruited
Wangler as another strong-side
linebacker to compete with
Winovich once redshirt junior
starter Jake Ryan graduates.

seven letters link the Wolverines'
past with their present.
Jared wore the same num-
ber at De La Salle that his father
did at Michigan. He doesn't feel
pressure to live up to his father's
legacy, but he understands the
standard of playing for Michigan.
He's grown up in the Wangler
house long enough to know.
"(Character is) everything

you want them to be around a

When John gets up from the
dining room table, he pulls the
corner of the tablecloth to smooth
it out. Then the room is perfectly
neat again, the hallmark of a
player who played for 13-time Big
Ten champion Schembechler.
An hour later, the snow is
still coming down, harder than
before. It's relentless, inch after
inch coating the driveways and
stopping the cars in the streets,
just like the Wolverines' hard-
ships this season. First a near-loss
to Akron, then a four-overtime
loss to Penn State, then a humili-
ating loss at Michigan State.
A home loss to Nebraska, the
first in Hoke's tenure. A one point
loss to Ohio State. The sight of
Michigan State and Ohio State in
the Big Ten Championship.
There are people who don't
believe the snow will stop. An
hour later, it still hasn't. So John
sets out to shovel again.
Hours later, the snowstorm
ends. It's not clear when Michi-
gan's will, but Jared will be out

Three questions for Michigan in the bye week

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 13 Michigan hockey
team taught us plenty more than
five things in the first half of the
season.
Among other things, we
learned that when one goalie goes
down, there is another to do the
job just as well, if not better, than
the starter. That an 11-freshman
class can contribute from the
get-go. That sophomore forward
Andrew Copp has settled into his
role as a top scorer and is a Hobey
Baker Award fan-vote finalist.
But a long December and two
games in Madison against then-
No. 13 Wisconsin revealed that
there might be more questions
than answers.
With 16 games remaining
before the Big Ten tournament,
here are three questions fac-
ing the Wolverines as they head
toward the thick of their confer-
ence slate.
1. Do old habits die hard?
It is much, much too early to
say this team has derailed from a
track bound for success and down
the same path it did last year. Or
is it?
The Wolverines have lost their
last four games and haven't won
a contest since Dec. 2, nearly six
weeks ago. At this point, com-
parisons to last season are hard

to ignore.
In two games against No. 9
Wisconsin, Michigan faced simi-
lar offensive misfortunes as it did
last season: a lack of presence in
front of the net and an inability to
bury rare chances to score. The
Wolverines were plaguedby simi-
lar streakiness up until March of
last year.
And these struggles are only
magnified when we consider the
Wolverines have one thing going
for them that wasn't last year:
goaltending. But in front of an
error-prone defense, freshman
goalie Zach Nagelvoort cannot be
the difference between a win and
a loss, especially this weekend.
Still, the rhetoric from the
Michigan locker room suggests
that this series of unfortunate
losses won't keep the Wolverines
down as it would have in the past.
2. Is time a factor?
Michigan competed five times
in December, and came out with
nothing more than a win over
Ohio State, a tie with Ferris State,
an exhibition loss and two defeats
at the Great Lakes Invitational.
It wasn't until two weeks later
that the Wolverines were able
to play in front of a crowd. And
Michigan won't play its next con-
test until Jan. 23, when it faces
off against Michigan State at Joe
Louis Arena.
Over that time, Michigan has

Not a pushover, M' overcomes Penn State

Walton's career-high
performance sparks offense

Penn State last season in Happy

With help from freshman
ward DnrrickWaltn _Tr'c 12

By DANEIL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
When Penn State coach
Patrick Chambers compiled his
list of keys to beating Michigan
on Tuesday night, it's safe to say
freshman point guard Derrick
Walton Jr. wasn't at the top of his
list.
On a team stocked full of talent,
highlighted by sophomores Nik
Stauskas and Glenn Robinson
III, Walton simply isn't one of
the Wolverines's go-to threats to
score. But Walton wasted little
time making Chambers regret
not keying in on the freshman, as
Michigan knocked off the Nittany
Lions, 80-67, thanks to 16 points
from the point guard.
"Now he's on ourt-" Chambers
said, pausing, not ready to admit
that he completely overlooked
Walton. "Not that he wasn't on
our radar, but he really stepped
up today."
Right out of the gate,
Walton made his presence felt.
Capitalizing on the attention
Penn State paid to Stauskas and
Robinson, Walton drilled a wide-
open 3-pointer from the corner
just 13 seconds into the game. It
was a sign of things to come, as
Walton was repeatedly left open
on the perimeter, specifically in
the corner opposite Stauskas,
giving him room to operate a
steady inside-out game.
Eleven seconds after his first
make, Walton was the beneficiary
of a steal by sophomore guard
Caris LeVert for an easy fast-
break layup. Less than two
minutes later, the freshman hit
another 3-pointer from the same
corner, extending Michigan's lead
to 8-0.
"It really propelled us"

Robinson said. "He's been
working hard and I'm just glad to
see him hit eight straight points,
especially to make the defense
respect him. Sometimes they
don't respect him, think he's a
pass-first (point guard).
"I think he has gained a lot
more confidence."
Minutes later, with the shot
clock winding down and the
ball in his hands beyond the arc,
Walton penetrated and drew
a foul. He knocked down both
free throws to give him 10 of the
Wolverines' first 14 points.
It was the first of three buck-
ets Walton scored in the final
moments of the shot clock - a sig-
nificantboost to the offense that's
still searching for a secondary
option to Stauskas who can create
his own shot, especially with the
shot clock winding down.
"That's critical for us,"
Robinson said. "He did a great job
at finding his own shot tonight."
By halftime, Walton's 12 first-
half points nearly matched his
career-high 14 points for an entire
game.
Walton was held scoreless for
the first 13 minutes of the second
half as Robinson and Stauskas
took control of the offense, but
the point guard did hit two big
baskets to give him a career-
high 16 points. His efficient night
ended with a six-for-nine mark
from the field. He was credited
for just three assists, though that
figure is misleading, as his ability
to constantly penetrate the lane
thanks to what Michigan coach
John Beilein called "jet-quick"
dribble-drive moves created a
lot of space for the Wolverines's
shooters.
"There's a lot going on inside
that freshman's brain and he's

trying to pick his spots," Beilein
said. "It's slow steps forward
he's making as far as running
our offense and understanding
all the stuff that we do. It can be
confusing at times ... but I can
se it siomino- down and se himm

in the first minute of action.
The Detroit native didn't
stop there either, as he swished
another 3-pointer at the 17:39
mark to give Michigan an 8-0
lead.
Thanks to sloppy play on
offense - eight first-half turn-
overs compared to two for the
Wolverines - the Nittany Lions
were forced to play catch-up the
entire first half, with their deficit
never getting below four.
However, in the second half,
things started to resemble last
year's .game. After leading by
seven at the half, Michigan let
Penn State continue its run from
the end of the half to cut what
had been a13-point lead to 40-37.
With Iashbacks of last year's
collapse coming back, starting
from the end of the first half,
Michigan put a quick end to the
Nittany Lions' outburst soon
thereafter.
"We talked about (last
year's game) at halftime," said
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas.
"We were up by seven or eight,
I think it was the exact same
thing at Penn State. We made.
that note, especially to Derrick
and (freshman forward) Zak
(Irvin) - the freshmnen - saying
we were in the same position last
year, so we couldn't let down."
While Michigan coach John
Beilein rejected the concept that
he brought last year's game up
during intermission, saying he
has the same approach to every
game regardless of history or
opponent, he was happy the play-
ers inade note of the similarities.
Though the consequence of
letting Penn State back in the
game was reminiscent of last
year, Michigan recovered from
the Nittany Lions' quick second-
half start. After halting the run
with a 3-pointer from sophomore
guard Caris LeVert, Michigan
hovered for a few minutes with
a small lead before unleashing
a 9-0 run - highlighted by an
alley-oop from LeVert to sopho-

more forward Glenn Robinson
III - to push the lead back to 12.
"They answered the bellevery
time," said Penn State coach Pat-
rick Chambers. "You know what
Nik's going to do. You know what
Robinson's going to do. It's the
other guys you try totake care of
that stepped up tonight."
After the brief scare, Michi-
gan never saw its lead fall back
below eight. While Walton
continued his hot play from
Nebraska, finishing with °a
career-high 16 points, the Wol-
verines' unselfishness on offense
also enabled them to control the
game. Racking up assists on 12 of
their 14 baskets in the first half-
with four apiece by Levert and
Stauskas - the Wolverines were
able to work the ball all over the
court, creating options for bas-
kets in the paint (12 points) and
beyond the arc (six 3-pointers).
While being more of a distrib-
utor in the first half to go along
with his eight points, Stauskas
scored 13 in the second half on
drives to the rim and 3-pointers
to cushion Michigan's lead.
"He's got that great
combination that very few
people have," Beilein said of
Stauskas. "He can't just shoot.
He can really shoot. So now you
can drive as well and you can
pass. He's really showing he can
play the guard position."
Added Stauskas: "In the
second half, they played a little
bit more honest and the lane was
opening up for me, so I was just
trying to be aggressive."
Though Michigan led from
start to finish, Penn State's
backcourt duo of D.J. Newbill
and Tim Frazier combined for 34
points and kept the game within
reach, until John Johnson
missed a triple with 2:19 left that
would have put its deficit back to
single digits.
With the missed opportunity,
Michigan ran the clock down on
long possessions and secured its
sixth straight victory.

getting better at it."
Tuesday night was Walton's
third consecutive game scoring
in double figures. And as he
continues to appear on opposing
coaches' radars, as Chambers
said he will, it will only continue
to make Michigan's offense more
potent as it diversifies beyond just
Stauskas and Robinson.

first-half points, the Wolverines
did just that, defeating the
Nittany Lions,80-67.
From the start, it appeared
Michigan (4-0 Big Ten, 12-4
overall) would be in control
as Walton scored'the first five
points of the game in the first 24
seconds, while Penn State (0-5,

Synagogue and Mosque: uniting communities on campus and beyond
by Carolyn Gearig

the thought bubble

While Muslim-Jewish relations have,
at least in the modern era, been marked
by conflict, MuJew, an interfaith campus
organization composed primarily of Mus-
lim and Jewish students, strives to create
an alliance between the two campus com-
munities through dialogue, intercultural
events and community service work.
LSA sophomore Saara Mohammed, LSA
junior Jesse Moehlman, LSA junior Laura
Katsnelson and LSA senior Mariam Khan
make up part of MuJew's executive board.
Moehlman and Katsnelson are Jewish
while Khan and Mohammed are Muslim;
Moehlman and Katsnelson are co-chairs
of the organization and Mohammed is
outreach chair, coordinating work MuJew
does around campus and with other orga-
nizations. Khan was a chair in 2013.
"The goal is to create a community and a
safe space for Jews and Muslims, and real-
ly anyone who's interested on campus,"
Khan said. "Both of us come from margin-
alized communities in the US - you see a
lot of anti-Semitism, a lot of Islamophobia.
So I think there's a lot of value in our com-
munities coming together in creating a
new community and being able to support
each other."
MuJew was founded in October 2010 by
University alums Jenna Weinberg, Molly
Mardit and Husnah Khan in an effort
,.-to create dialogue, understanding and
friendship between Muslim and Jewish
students. The organization was born out
of the yearly MuJew Alternative Spring
Break trip, which was previously the only
formal medium where Muslim and Jewish
students formally worked together.
Muslims and Jews are comparatively
small minorities in the United States,
both practiced by fewer than 2 percent
of the population. They are minorities on
campus as well, with around 3 percent of
University undergraduates identifying as
Muslim and 12 percent identifying as Jew-
ish.
MuJew meets once a week to engage in
a dialogue centered around weekly top-
ics that have previously included gender
relations, members' relationships with
religion, holy books, fasting and person-
al stories about religion. Members are
encouraged to share thoughts, experienc-
es and insight. Between 10 and 20 students
attend dialogue meetings, depending on
the topic.
However, according to Khan and
Mohammed, the most important MuJew
traditions are the the Juma'a Shabbat
event once a semester and the yearly
Alternative Spring Break trip.
Juma'a Shabbat aims to expose people
of both faiths to each other's religious tra-
ditions. On Fridays, Jewish students are
invited to traditional Muslim afternoon
prayers and Muslim students are invited

to Shabbat services and dinner before
the weekly holiday in which some Jews
abstain from using technology and do not
work from sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday.
After the Friday prayers and again after
Shabbat dinner, Hillel assistant director
Rabbi Seth Winberg, assistant director of
Hillel, and Muslim Chaplain Mohammed
Tayssir Safi lead discussions and answer
questions. As the first endowed Muslim
Chaplain at a public university, Safi works
with students of all faiths, but primarily
the approximately 850 Muslim students
on campus. He works
with other religious "There'
leaders on campus as
well as the Muslim Stu- OUr COmn
dent Association.

The Rabbi who previ-
ously held his position suppOI
was involved in creat-
ing MuJew, so Winberg MARIAM KHAN
became involved in
ASB, accompanying them on trips he also
helped organize.
MuJew runs one ASB trip a year. Mus-
lim and Jewish students plan a community
service trip to a distressed area: Through-
out the school year, they learn about the
culture and history of the area and com-
munity they will be serving. During
spring break, they travel to the area and
engage in manual work and toward under-
standing the issues at hand. One Muslim
and one Jewish leader advise the group
and travel with students - Winberg has
been the Jewish adviser since 2012 along

with a different Muslim graduate student
each year.
LSA senior Jesse Moehlman, the
MuJew co-chair, said he, applied to go on
his first MuJew ASB trip because of the
interfaith focus.
"The different discussions related to
our faiths, our reactions to the work we
were doing, and our conversations with
different members of the Joplin commu-
nity proved to be an incredible and diverse
experience," he said in an e-mail inter-
view. "I especially enjoyed meeting with
local Muslim and Jewish congregations,
and hearing their

with the com-
, 2013 MUJEW CO-CHAIR munity members
we spoke with
and among the
ASB participants, and created a new kind
of community fostering continued service
and intercultural understanding."
The 2011 and 2012 ASB trips involved
disaster relief after tornados. In 2011,
MuJew went to Birmingham, Alabama, to
provide help after the April 2011 tornado
that killed 64 people and injured more
than 1,500 - leaving thousands of dam-
aged homes, buildings and communities
in its aftermath. In Birmingham, students
stayed in a synagogue and worked with
the Islamic Circles of North America's
disaster relief unit, the Jewish Disaster

Response Core and Habitat for Human-
ity in rebuilding two houses that had been
destroyed.
Less than a month after the tornado in
Birmingham, there was a tornado in Jop-
lin, Missouri that killed 158 and resulted
in $2.8 billion in damage. MuJew trav-
eled here in March 2013 and worked again
with the Jewish Disaster Response Core
and the Islamic Circles of North America.
"The thing about disaster is there
are usually needs in the community for
rebuilding long after the disaster," Win-
berg said. "It's also a compelling service
project because it's a time in a community
where you don't need to have expert man-
ual labor skills. If you can hold a hammer
and put on gloves, there's usually some-
thing to do. It's always been important
to me that the service trips Hillel is part
of meet a real need in a community, the
kind of service that can be a short term
commitment because they need whatever
help you can provide for as long as you
can provide it - not like some other ser-
vice projects that raise moral questions
of dropping in and build something the
community may or may not need, and then
going back to Ann Arbor."
In Joplin, MuJew students stayed in a
church set up to house volunteers. They
worked on demolishing a damaged house
so it could be rebuilt. Both trips involved
manual labor during the day and bonding
activities at night. On Fridays during ASB,
MuJew had lunch and afternoon prayers
with local Muslims and Shabbat dinner at
a nearby synagogue.
For Mohammed, participating in a
MuJew trip was her first experience with
MuJew. She joined the organization soon
after she traveled to Joplin.
"It's a unique space where both groups
come together," she said.
Mohammed and Moehlman will lead
seven other students in the 2014 MuJew
ASB trip. Nine students and two advisers
will travel to the south side of Chicago to
work with the Inner City Muslim Action
Network, which advocates for social jus-
tice and runs a variety of programs in the
city including health and youth services
and art programs.
"The MuJew ASB (is) a unique opportu-
nity to serve with both Muslim and Jewish
students and to have a meaningful impact
on the community," Moehlman said.
Winberg said he thinks the work
MuJew does has the potential for greater
societal impact.
"Judaism and Islam have much in com-
mon that Jews and Muslims don't realize,"
he said. "You go down to Birmingham and
Joplin to help others, and the added bonus
is you discover that your peers of another
religion and culture have similar experi-
ences and traditions. It's very powerful."

On the Decline:
Why Religion is Fad ing
from Campus
by Charlotte Jenkins, Daily Staff Reporter

tion, 300 students attend Friday prayer ser-
vices every week. The organization has active
student committees that range from commu-
nity service and outreach to lectures around
religious topics.
Soubani discussed how the Muslim Stu-
dents' Association has to be mindful about
being inclusive of different kinds of Muslim
practices.
"We are realizing that we are a big (organi-
zation), so we are trying to figure out how to
maintain our values but also keep expanding
and doing new things," Soubani said.
However, not all religious groups on cam-
pus feel the pressure to actively pursue more
student involvement.
The Baha'i Club is a smaller campus orga-
nization that practices the faith Baha'i, a reli-
gion that traces its roots to a 19th-century
Persian religious authority, Bahi'u'llih. The
Baha'i Club has no formal recruitment pro-
cess. While membership levels have remained
steady, club activity has increased.
Guidance, ground, direction
Gifford was raised as a Baha'i. His parents
became Baha'i in college after finding the faith
and realizing that its set of core beliefs aligned
with their own. Gifford said that he would
have trouble navigating his undergraduate
experience without his Baha'i faith.
"Religion is a way to help guide you in one
direction," Gifford said. "On college cam-
puses, I have no doubt that being associated
with a religious or spiritual group is helpful
because college is such a confusing time."
Kaur echoed Gifford's beliefs, adding that
her faith has been a steadfast part of her col-
lege experience.
"Religion has been something that has
helped ground me as I've gone through under-
grad, it has been consistent," she said. "I know
if I have a rough day that in the morning I
have this hour to myself to center myself and
do prayers."
A sense of community
At such a large university, it can be diffi-
cult to find one's own community. For some
students, the existing 106 student religious
groups provide a sense of belonging.
"I haven't felt isolated as a religious stu-
dent," Soubani said, "itgives you a community
where there are so many types of people."

Despite the existing sense of community,
others feel that religion could be a larger part
of Michigan culture.
As a freshman from Rochester, Mich., liv-
ing in Helen Newberry, LSA Junior Laura
Fleming was overwhelmed by college life. She
had expected to make friends easily with the
girls on her hall, but found herself lonely.
Fleming was raised as a Lutheran, and had
planned to find a church at college. She tried
out New Life, and immediately found a place
she felt at home.
"I was blown away by the community,"
Fleming said, "I've searched my whole life to
feel like I fit in and am truly loved and cared
for and the people at New Life have done that
for me."
The 'invisible divide'
Despite a strong sense of solidarity within
one's belief group, students remain consci-
entious of the boundaries between religious
communities and the rest of campus. LSA
senior Mary Hemmeter, secretary of the Secu-
lar Student Alliance, explained that beingsec-
ular limits her access to other communities.
"Being secular, it can be difficult to speak
to non-secular people," Hemmeter said, "you
feel like you always have to self-center."
Hemmeter speaks to an invisible divide that
many students on this campus may experi-
ence. Like many religious students, she is con-
stantly aware of her identity.
"(I) rarely tell people I'm on the board of
(the Secular Student Alliance)," she said. "It's
not something that comes up often in conver-
sation and I don't feel the need to bring it up
a lot."
Meanwhile, joining such a tight-knit com-
munity has also left students isolated from
others. As part of her religion, Fleming does
not drink alcohol or swear, and will not have
sex until she is married. She said that these
values are in stark contrast with the popular
culture on campus.
"There have been a lot of people who are
like, 'Why don't you do that,' or don't under-
stand," Fleming said.
Soubani added that students on campus
often refer to stereotypes and have miscon-
ceptions about Muslims. She said she wishes
students were more mindful of what they say,
especially in academic settings that are sup-
posed to be safe spaces.

Student priorities
Nate Ardle has been the Michigan campus
director of Cru, the largest interdomination-
al evangelical Christian organization in the
country, since 1999. When Ardle first came to
the University, he said he expected the stu-
dents to be highly intellectual and philosophi-
cal. Instead, he said he found that students
have less time to be involved because of the
rigorous academics.
However, Ardle noted that this is to he
expected. "Students here are not different
from students everywhere," he said.
other challenges include trying to fit reli-
gion into a busy schedule.
Fleming has to balance her religious com-
mitments with academic and social ones. As
a pre-health student, Fleming feels the pres-
sure to volunteer and be in clubs to build her
resume before applyingto graduate school.
"Part of me feels like someone who is in an
organization where they're sending money to
kids in Africa, that might be looked at more
highly than being really involved in a church,"
Fleming said.
After all, many college students, according
to Chabad House Rabbi Alter Goldstein, are
here primarily to get an education.
"The main obstacle is that spirituality may
not be a priority, academics is the number one
thing," Goldstein said.
Some students deal better with the balance
of academics, religion, and extracurriculars
because they overlap.
LSA sophomore Ali Meisel revitalized the
defunct Jewish Greek Council after Hillel
Director Tilly Shames reached out to her with
the opportunity. Meisel said she has found
it easier to balance her school and social life
with her religious commitments because the
two generally intertwine.
"It's not hard to balance," Meisel said,
"because most of the extracurriculars I'm
involved with - Hillel, Jewish Greek Council,
my sorority - are Jewish."
A spirituallandscape
As religious identification declines, it seems
students have turned increasingly to the con-
cept of'spirituality.'
LSA senior Farid Dimag, a practicing
Baha'i, views religion as "rules of enforcing
stuff," and spirituality as a "wholesome puri-
fying experience."

Gifford echoed the ways in which religion
and spirituality contrast.
"The modern day connotation of religion
is changing," he said. "Spirituality is like an
independent investigation of something."
Meanwhile, Goldstein emphasized that
spirituality and religion are inexorably tied.
"When someone is seeking a higher spiri-
tual level, they must also understand God,"
Goldstein said. "Good values and spirituality
are synonymous."
The trend of modernity
Sitting in the secluded quiet of the Chabad
House in the early morning, Goldstein
explained the pattern of society's movement,
"The world is a heartbeat, and everything
comes in trends," he said.
Accordingto Goldstein, the trend of moder-
nity is one of informational access. Today's
students utilize the Internet, and as a result,
have instant access to information - including
immediate access to religious resources.
"We used to have at our front entrance
a huge display of all kinds of information,"
Goldstein said. "Today, it is there with a click
of a button - the website has a wealth of infor-
mation."
The trend of modernity has led to a change
in student attitude and background, according
to Ardle, the Cru campus director.
"Students are less 'churched' than they
have in the past," Ardle explains, "It's become
prevalent for students to not have gone to
church growing up."
Ardle believes this decline in "churched
students" impacts the level of student involve-
ment on campus.
"In the late 90s and early 2000s, students
would come in and say 'I should get involved
(in religion)', and some wouldn't, but many
would because they thought they should,"
Ardle said, "And now that sense of thinking
you should is gone."
A (non-religious) 'coming out'
The trend to modernity has, indeed, left
fewer religious students on campus. Mean-
while, secularism - the belief in the separa-
tion of church and state - has a solid, while
small, following.
Just as religious students may feel that they
have to defend their religion and values to
others, secular students can have a hard time

"coming out" as atheist. Students who come
from religious families face losing support
from their loved ones if they reveal this part
of themselves.
The Secular Student Alliance meets every
Thursday night. Meetings include discus- -
sions, such as reviewing recent court cases
that have to do with separation of church and
state. Over the summer, board members trav-
eled to Skepticon, the largest secular confer-
ence in the Midwest.
Hemmeter said Student Secular Alliance
has racial and ethnic demographics consistent
with that of the University, but also has strong
representation from many members of the
LGBTQ community. She added that Skepticon
also had many LGBTQ activists and feminist
activists.
"I think there are a lot of students who
identify as secular or atheist or agnostic who
do not feel the need to be involved in a secular
group," Hemmeter said.
Taking ownership
College is a time in everyone's life where
students are actively trying to figure out who
they are. As a result, religion - or lack of reli-
gion - can be a shaping factor in this stage of
student life, Gifford said.
Within the religious community at the
University, some students are religious due
to familial background. However, students
stress college as a time where one can seize
and shape one's own religious ideology. Sou-
bani was raised Muslim.
"You're raised something and you do that
because your family does," Soubani said, "but
once you're in college you have opportunity to
take ownership of your own beliefs."
Kaur's expression of her religion has
shifted significantly while in college. As a
freshman, she was less involved in the Sikh
Students' Association and did not wear a tur-
ban. Kaur felt very affected by the August
2012 shooting at a Sikh temple in Wiscon-
sin that killed six people, and following the
incident, made the decision to start wearing
a turban.
"I wasn't sure how to talk about it with my
roommates," Kaur said, "People may look at
me differently and think that I'm coming from
a different place than them."
Regardless of the social challenges, Kaur
holds steadfast to her religion. "I'm sticking to
my identity and mybeliefs," she said.

t was past midnight on a cold Fri-
day, the weekend of Halloween,
and LSA junior Harleen Kaur,
an Honors Resident Adviser and
Michigan Daily columnist, had to
make a decision. On duty in West
Quad, she had spent most of the evening
dealing with noise violations and drunken
decisions of her freshman residents. Students
returning from their respective Halloween
parties, clad in minion and cat costumes, had
kept her busy all night.
By the time Kaur had completed her shift
and filled out the required duty logs record-
ing all the night's incidents, it was around 5
a.m. She soon found herself wondering if she
should stay up and pray, or sleep. If she slept,
she knew she would be taking a risk. The
morning was already only four hours away,
and she might not have enough time to pray
then.
After deliberating, Kaur chose to pray. She
showered and returned to her room to pray,
going to sleep around 7:30 a.m. Soon after, she
woke up to attend her 10 a.m. resident adviser

staff meeting.
As a practicing Sikh, Kaur is required to
pray five times daily. Sikhism, the world's fifth
largest religion, is a monotheistic faith estab-
lished in northern India in the 1400s. Like
many religions, practicing Sikhism requires
time and effort. And like many religious stu-

Kaur is part of a group on campus that has
been declining in recent years. The CIRP
Freshman Survey, administered by the Coop-

men self-identified themselves as having no
religion.
The latest results are consistent with a
long-running trend. In 1998, only 19.7 percent
of incoming freshmen identified as non-reli-

population on campus have made similar
efforts to recruit more students.
