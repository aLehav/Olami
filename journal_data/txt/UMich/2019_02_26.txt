LSA 
sophomore 
Jack 
Wroldsen came to the University 
of Michigan knowing he was 
interested in a history degree. 
Yet Wroldsen said he faced 
skepticism from parents and 
employers about the choice when 
he declared a history major.
“My boss at my internship last 
summer basically told me that 
I shouldn’t major in history,” 
Wroldsen said. “I worked at a 
law firm, and he asked me ‘When 
do you ever think I’m going to 
hire a historian?’ which was 
interesting. I think people have 
reservations about it because it 
isn’t really a field you’d go get 
a job in unless you want to be a 
teacher of history or a professor 
or work in a museum.”
Even so, Wroldsen said he 
chose to study history because 

it complements most fields of 
study, even if others perceive 
the degree to be useless or 
unemployable. He’s pairing the 
degree with economics. 
He said a course on Europe 
since 1945 with Professor Rita 
Chin convinced him to declare 
history as his major, alongside 
economics. 
“I’m majoring in history in 
part because I love it, and it’s 
what I’m most interested in, 
but also because I can look at 
economic history, or business 
history, or things of that nature,” 
Wroldsen said. “And people can 
do that with medicine, they can 
do it with psychology. Any field 
has a history to it, and being 
a history major only supports 
those interests.”
The skepticism witnessed by 
Wroldsen mirrors a trend found 
at the University and across 
the nation. Jay Cook, chair of 

the history department, said 
the number of undergraduate 
students declaring a history 
major at the University has 
decreased each year for the past 
decade, reflecting a nationwide 
trend. 
A 
study 
by 
Benjamin 
Schmidt, assistant professor 
of 
history 
at 
Northeastern 
University, found that while 
the number of history majors is 
declining among students of all 
races, genders and geographic 
backgrounds, the dip is most 
prominent among universities 
in the Midwest.
Since the Great Recession 
of 2007-2009 — when the 
U.S. labor market lost around 
8.4 million jobs and a typical 
household 
saw 
their 
yearly 
income decline by $2,700 — the 
belief that majoring in history 
leads to low paychecks and 
limited employment prospects 

has deterred students across 
the country from pursuing the 
major. 
Even at the University, where 
the 
history 
department 
is 
consistently ranked as one of the 
top ten programs in the country 
by U.S. News and World Report, 
the department has noticed the 
declining numbers in the major 
despite 
steady 
interest 
and 
enrollment in history courses.
Degree 
reports 
from 
the 
Office of the Registrar show 
that while there were 251 
History 
B.A.s 
conferred 
in 
2006, the number of history 
graduates was down to 131 by 
2016. That downward trend 
is matched at Michigan State 
University, where there were 
262 declared history majors in 
the spring of 2006 and 137 in the 
spring of 2019.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The University of Michigan 
Institute for Social Research 
and Rackham Graduate School 
sponsored the latest installment 
of the Cultural Racism and 
American 
Social 
Structure 
Speaker Series Monday morning. 
The lecture consisted of a panel 
of three faculty members from 
Washington 
University 
in 
St. Louis who discussed how 
today’s racial tension is a result 

of historical mistreatment of 
minority groups, particularly 
African 
Americans. 
The 
audience included about 30 
students and faculty members.
Margaret Hicken, assistant 
professor of research at the 
Survey Research Center of the 
Institute for Social Research 
who oversees the RacismLab, 
organized the series to highlight 
how American culture is racist 
toward and marginalizes those 
who do not fit the ideal American 
image.

“We have an idea in this 
country of what it means to be 
American,” Hicken said. “If 
you don’t fit those ideals, then 
your citizenship and sense of 
belonging is questioned. The 
speaker series talks about the 
idea of who gets to belong in 
this society and the underlying 
idea of what it means to be an 
American.”
The 
panel, 
which 
was 
presented on behalf of the 
Lasting 
Legacies 
exhibit 
at 
Washington University in St. 

Louis, aims to analyze how the 
study of history is critical to 
understanding modern concepts 
of equality. The project’s goal 
is to demonstrate that history 
is 
continuous. 
Though 
the 
present-day United States may 
look different than it did in the 
past, its policy of undermining 
minorities has stayed the 
same.

The Michigan Daily recently 
sat down with E. Royster Harper, 
vice president of student life 
at the University of Michigan, 
to discuss several issues on 
campus, including disaffiliated 
fraternities, 
the 
sexual 
misconduct policy revision and 
mental 
health 
resources 
on 
campus.
The Michigan Daily: Within 
the past year, several University 
of 
Michigan 
fraternities 
have 
disaffiliated 
from 
the 
Interfraternity Council. They 
have since joined the Ann Arbor 
Interfraternity Council, which 
does not fall under University 
jurisdiction. As an administrator, 
what are your opinions regarding 
these actions and how will the 
University address issues that 
arise regarding the fraternities 
in IFC?

When 
G 
Ryan 
started 
swimming at 6 years old, they 
swam just to prove they could to 
an older brother. They continued 
the 
sport 
into 
collegiate 
athletics and eventually earned 
a scholarship to the University 
of Michigan. Friends described 
Ryan as a “big name” in their area, 
a kind teammate and a successful 
member of the distance squad of 
the women’s team.
However, when Ryan came out 
as gender non-binary sophomore 
year, things changed.
“People had to change in order 
to interact with me,” Ryan said. 
“They could not exist as they had 
previously. My pronouns changed 
and my name changed. That kind 
of had to be acknowledged.”
Ryan, who uses they, them and 
their pronouns, graduated from 
the University in the winter 
of 2018 after spending four 
years competing in collegiate 
athletics.

Monday afternoon outside 
of the home of University of 
Michigan 
president 
Mark 
Schlissel, 
demonstrators 
from the Michigan chapter 
of 
the 
National 
Action 
Network gathered to voice 
concerns regarding U-M Flint 
professor Mark Perry’s recent 
claim against Wayne State 
University. The claim, filed 
last week, accused Wayne 
State’s 
summer 
program, 
Black Girls Code, of race and 
gender discrimination.
According to a press release, 
NAN held the demonstration 
to 
protest 
Perry’s 
claim. 
They 
argued 
Black 
Girls 
Code serves to educate and 
empower 
a 
marginalized 
group of women.
“National Action Network 
activists are outraged that 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Professor would work to stifle 
a program built to teach and 
empower 
disenfranchised, 
underrepresented, 
and 
underserved young women of 
color,” the press release reads. 
“In a climate when University 
of 
Michigan 
currently 
struggles with diversity in 
faculty staffing and student 
admissions activist(s) believe 
that University of Michigan 
should assess the relation 

between the professor and 
the university.” 
Fifteen members of NAN 
attended the demonstration, 
chanting, 
“No 
justice, 
no 
peace,” and “Hey hey, ho 
ho, Professor Mark Perry 
has got to go.” Rev. Charles 
Williams II, president of the 
Michigan chapter of NAN, 
spoke on behalf of NAN at the 
demonstration. He said the 
University’s silence on the 
issue is unacceptable.
“The 
University 
should 
either decide to send him 
(Perry) a message making it 
clear that this is not upholding 
the ideals of the University 
of Michigan, or they need to 
make sure they send out a 
statement letting the public 
know that this is not the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
stance,” Williams said. “We 
are calling on Schlissel, we 
are calling on the Board of 
Regents immediately to take 
a stand on where they are on 
this issue.”
Williams said NAN plans 
to take legal action against 
Perry and will continue to 
protest until the University 
addresses the issue. He said 
the University needs to step 
up and be more accountable 
for 
Perry’s 
duties 
as 
a 
professor.

The University of Michigan 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs met Monday 
to 
discuss 
immunization 
requirement policies and the 
provost’s recent revisions to the 
faculty handbook. 
Laurita Thomas, associate 
vice 
president 
of 
Human 
Resources at the University, 
also spoke to the committee 
on 
retirement 
planning, 
health 
benefit 
programs, 
future improvements in talent 
acquisition 
and 
retention, 
preventing sexual misconduct 
and addressing the demands of 
health and well-being across 
campus.
SACUA 
member 
Michael 
Atzmon, professor of nuclear 
engineering and radiological 
sciences, began the meeting 

by discussing the University’s 
immunization 
requirement. 
At 
many 
universities, 
immunizations 
are 
required 
for the entire student body; 
however, the University only 
recommends them for incoming 
students.
Atzmon 
expressed 
concerns 
the 
University 
might 
preferentially 
draw 
students who do not want to 
be immunized and asked if 
a different policy should be 
suggested to the administration.
“I think most of the Western 
world has had a very practical 
and reasonable solution and 
most 
diseases 
have 
been 
eradicated so we don’t want 
to go back — at least I don’t,” 
Atzmon said.
SACUA member Ruth Carlos, 
professor of radiology, brought 
up herd immunity, or the concept 
that vaccinations protect both 

the individual and the group, 
and how low vaccination rates 
can facilitate infection of an 
entire community. 
“Who has to assume the risk 
of vaccination in order to protect 
others?” Carlos said. “Would 
you want your child to assume 
the rare but potentially serious 
risk of vaccination in order to 
protect someone else?”
Other 
SACUA 
members 
brought up concerns about 
the image the University is 
presenting to the public by 
adopting this stance and the 
additional 
imposition 
on 
students and faculty where 
vaccinations are required. 
Following 
the 
vaccination 
policy 
discussion, 
SACUA 
member Sarah Lippert, associate 
professor of art history at U-M 
Flint, 
talked 
about 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert’s 
revisions 
of the faculty handbook. The 
faculty handbook, published 
by the Office of the Provost, 
explains the guidelines for 
University faculty behavior. 
The current version is abridged 
and lacks original content, 
including 
any 
information 
about the faculty grievance 
process which details the 
procedure regarding a faculty 
employment concerns. The 
new handbook also includes 
a statement in the preface 
stating it is only for Ann Arbor 
faculty.
“This is like crisis level 
for the Flint faculty and I 
would say Dearborn as well 
because 
they’ve 
added 
a 
statement,” Lippert said. “As 
far as I can tell, it’s a new 
statement that undermines 
decades-long tradition that 
we are one faculty on three 
campuses. That one statement 
is extraordinarily destructive 
in my opinion because it 
introduces all kinds of lack of 
clarity about who this applies 
to.”
Lippert 
expressed 
her 

concerns 
regarding 
Flint’s 
lack of a separate employee 
handbook. She requested the 
provost not change the preface 
of the handbook to suggest 
the rules only apply to the Ann 
Arbor campus.
“From my perspective, we’re 
in danger of having the bulk of 
the protections of the faculty 
code ripped away from the Flint 
faculty.”
SACUA chair Neil Marsh 
suggested they follow up on 
this issue with the Office 
of the Provost and add the 
full handbook to the Senate 
Assembly’s website.
Laurita Thomas then spoke 
on HR’s successful programs 
that help University employees 
plan for retirement and provide 
employees more health benefits, 
including help with in-vitro 
fertilization, facial feminization 
surgery and extending parental 
leave. She discussed adapting 
to change and how HR will 
continue to improve the health 
and well-being of people at the 
University after she retires in 
October.
“We see that there are many 
changes in our community, in 
the environment, in the world, 
that are going to impact the way 
we deliver HR services in the 
future,” she said.
She 
envisions 
future 
improvements 
to 
address 
recruitment 
and 
acquisition 
strategies, 
depression 
and 
anxiety resulting from stress 
and burnouts in both students 
and faculty and creating a safe 
environment 
by 
facilitating 
discussion with civility and 
respect. Increased attention and 
discussion of workplace sexual 
harassment 
and 
misconduct 
issues can also help improve 
the culture overall, Thomas 
remarked.

FEB IS ENDING :(

They now work as the program 
specialist 
for 
education 
and 
training at the Spectrum Center.
Ryan first realized they were 
non-binary after encountering 
uncomfortable situations in the 
women’s bathrooms on campus.
“When I got on campus, I 
was having a really hard time 
using the restrooms, because I 
kept using these (the women’s) 
restrooms because I thought that 
was where I was supposed to go,” 
Ryan said. “And legally, that’s 
accurate, but then everyone kept 
getting upset that I was using 
them, so I kept running into really 
uncomfortable situations that I 
was struggling with.”
After disclosing their problems 
with using the bathroom to a few 
people, Ryan was directed to the 
Spectrum Center. There, they 
talked to Director Will Sherry 
about where to find gender-
inclusive restrooms on campus. 
Sherry also introduced them to 
a packet of vocabulary terms for 
the LGBTQ+ community, most 
of which Ryan had never heard 
before.
“I knew a handful of them,” 
Ryan said. “Ninety percent of 
what was listed, it was my first 
time seeing them. That was 
really influential. It was kind of 
a catalyst for me to go down the 
rabbit hole of the internet and just 
learn more about the LGBTQ+ 
community and identity terms, 
and get into this understanding 
of gender as a spectrum and not 
just two different points. And 
then really start reflecting on 
what that meant for how I saw 
myself and getting language for 
the first time to really describe my 
relationship to my body and to my 
gender, and what that meant as a 

student-athlete, as someone who’s 
a swimmer.”
Swimming is not the easiest 
sport to participate in for a 
person coming out as non-binary, 
according to Ryan and their 
teammates on the swim team. The 
athletic clothing and emphasis on 
gender distinction can make it 
arduous for athletes who do not 
identify with the gender binary.
“We show up pretty much 
in underwear and are asked to 
train and compete day after day,” 
Ryan said. “And that’s really 
uncomfortable sometimes.”
This struggle with gender 
identity led Ryan to struggle with 
depression.
“I 
was 
at 
times 
very 
disassociated from everything 
that was going on,” Ryan said. “It 
felt like I would be going through 
the 
motions, 
but 
not 
really 
mentally or emotionally engaged 
with my day to day activities. And 
that was one of the symptoms 
definitely of my depression, that 
once I was able to get help and 
find resources and try things like 
medication, that became much 
easier to control. As a swimmer 
every day, I would change into a 
swimsuit and have to walk around 
in a body that felt uncomfortable, 
that didn’t feel it was really my 
body in a way that I could claim. 
Which is just an odd sensation to 
live in for an extended period of 
time.”
While Ryan came out as gender 
non-binary 
their 
sophomore 
year, they didn’t receive top 
surgery until after the end of 
their swimming career at the 
University.
They first attempted to change 
their body through other means.
“I tried a lot of different things 
to change my body,” Ryan said. 
“I was an athlete, so I trained 
harder, I tried different nutrition 
plans and I tried to change my 

muscle mass, and really see if 
that was it, if it was something 
I could change in that way. But 
really, I was very uncomfortable 
about my chest and the way that 
it looked, especially in a swimsuit, 
and I kept having to see that day 
after day after day. And so that 
contributed to my decision to go 
through with top surgery, but 
only after my swimming career 
was done.”
Ultimately, 
though, 
Ryan 
decided to wait to pursue top 
surgery because they were unsure 
of how it would affect their 
swimming scholarship or position 
on the team.
“I felt that in order to maintain 
my eligibility and consistency 
in performance and maintain 
that scholarship and the ability 
to attend this institution, that I 
needed to not interrupt it with any 
kind of major surgery, especially 
if that surgery was elected,” 
Ryan said. “And so that was one 
of the primary factors in waiting 
until the end of my competitive 
swimming career… just kind of 
not wanting to jeopardize that.”
Ryan said they considered 
switching to the men’s team or 
quitting swimming altogether at 
the end of each year. However, 
they said there was no alternative 
that 
seemed 
appropriate, 
an 
obvious conundrum for athletes 
who identify outside the gender 
binary in a binary sport.
“I thought about what the 
options were quite a lot, especially 
at the end of each year,” Ryan 
said. “But ultimately, I chose not 
to take any action to change my 
position, because there wasn’t 
an alternative that worked better 
for me. And there wasn’t an 
alternative that allowed me to 
affirm or support my gender that 
I could continue training in the 
same way with the same support 
structure, and I was comfortable 

in the routine of being part of the 
women’s team. It wasn’t quite 
right, it didn’t fit, but there was 
comfort in the fact that it was a 
habit.”
While 
Ryan’s 
non-binary 
identity can sometimes serve 
as a cause for confusion in a 
binary sport, Ryan said their 
gender assignment at birth has 
its privileges, as the NCAA does 
not prohibit participants who are 
designated female at birth from 
competing in men’s divisions, 
whereas it does prohibit male-
born participants from competing 
in women’s divisions.
“There’s definitely a privilege of 
people who are assigned female at 
birth competing in men’s division. 
There are far fewer restrictions 
than of people who are assigned 
men 
at 
birth 
competing 
in 
women’s,” Ryan said. “So the 
barriers to me are fewer than they 
could have been.”
While Ryan said they struggled 
with gender identity during their 
years on the swim team, they 
also felt the camaraderie and 
success they experienced on the 
team illustrate how good and bad 
things can occur simultaneously.
“Other times, being part of 
the team was really amazing,” 
Ryan said. “It was exciting and 
exhilarating. We accomplished 
some 
amazing 
things 
as 
a 
group, which was something I 
wouldn’t have be able to say as an 
individual, so that was being part 
of a team that was unique and 
valuable in my experience.””
When Ryan came out, they 
wrote an article in a swimming 
publication about being non-
binary and decided to come out 
to their team by alerting them of 
the article before it published. 
While Ryan said it may have been 
unconventional, 
the 
decision 
allowed them to come out to 
multiple people at once.

Ryan 
called 
the 
team’s 
reaction “entirely positive,” even 
though the team might not have 
been familiar with non-binary 
identities or the gender spectrum. 
 
“I was terrified,” Ryan said. 
“I was mostly terrified, because 
I had no idea what people’s 
reactions would be and that 
unknown, that question mark, 
was really unnerving. Nobody’s 
reaction was bad. I had an entirely 
positive reaction to my coming 
out to the swim team, to everyone 
I talked to. Definitely a lack of 
knowledge, which made perfect 
sense to me, because I had only 
recently acquired this vocabulary 
to talk about my own identity, 
so I didn’t have an expectation 
that other people knew, but I was 
incredibly nervous.”
While Ryan said the team’s 
reaction was positive, they did 
encounter obstacles with their 
decision to use they, them and 
their pronouns, which often felt 
exhausting.
“It was hard to have people try 
and use my pronouns,” Ryan said. 
“I would say that was one of the 
biggest barriers, one of the biggest 
challenges, that I encountered 
during my time as a swimmer. It 
depended on the day. Some days I 
completely understood why it was 
happening and that people were 
still practicing and getting used 
to it, and other days I was kind of 
just over it. I was done with the 
understanding perspective and 
I was in my own frustration. It 
had been enough time that I feel 
like people should be able to use 
my pronouns. And I wanted to be 
affirmed in that.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Claire 
Maiocco, 
Ryan’s 
former 
swimming 
teammate 
at 
the 
University, 
confirmed 
that 
teammates struggled to use Ryan’s 
pronouns, 
despite 
respecting 
Ryan and their abilities.

“Even to this day, I know 
there’ll be people like, ‘Oh how’s 
G doing? Is she doing well?’ and 
I’ll be like, ‘No.’ Or, ‘Yes, they 
are doing well,’” Maiocco said. 
“It’s not that people didn’t really 
accept them, because they were a 
big part of the team — especially 
in the distance crew, they’re very 
well-respected on the team — but 
I don’t really think people could 
understand the same struggles 
that they had to go through every 
day, whether it be having to go 
into a locker room with the label 
‘women’s’ on it, because that’s not 
who they are, or still constantly 
getting misgendered every day, 
even if somebody didn’t mean 
harm by it.”
Another 
teammate, 
LSA 
sophomore Sierra Schmidt, said 
Ryan’s positive attitude sometimes 
concealed the difficulties they had 
to undergo.
“G is such a strong person,” 
Schmidt said. “G always helped 
everyone. And they still do to this 
day. And I think because of that, 
there were a lot of times that I 
didn’t even know when they were 
struggling, because they were 
such a strong person that you 
could always depend on and go 
to.”
In the end, Ryan said they 
prioritized 
certain 
things 
in 
the women’s team, such as the 
camaraderie and success, that 
contributed to their happiness.
“I was part of a team that was 
successful,” Ryan said. “I was part 
of a distance swim group that had 
real camaraderie, and I would like 
to maintain that through the end 
of my swimming career because 
these were things that helped 
me to perform and compete and 
feel happy as a swimmer. So I 
prioritized those as I completed 
my swimming career.”

Cook 
said 
while 
there 
are 
currently 
around 
300 
declared history majors at the 
University, compared to 1,390 
computer science majors, there 
are more than 5,000 students 
enrolled in history courses 
this semester. This number, 
he said, has not changed since 
the 1990s even though the 
number of history majors has 
been cut in half. To combat 
this problem and raise the 
number of students interested 
in the history major, Cook 
said the department worked 
to improve its public relations 
and increase its social media 
presence.
“The 
decline 
in 
majors 
around the country started 
around 2010, in the wake of the 
global recession,” Cook wrote 
in an email interview. “In UM 
History, we still teach more 
than 5,000 students every year 
and have growing numbers of 
minors. But it’s true that our 
majors are down over the past 
decade—just like every other 
history 
department 
in 
our 
conference. Our first response 
was to focus on messaging 
with our students— and their 
parents and friends— to help 
them understand that majoring 
in history at UM was not a bad 
decision at all in relation to 

the post-grad job market—the 
tracking data is very clear 
about that.”
In 
2017, 
the 
department 
also developed a HistoryLab 
program 
that 
stresses 
collaboration 
and 
project-
based learning. In the labs, a 
team of undergraduates works 
closely with a faculty member 
to develop a project relating to 
modern, real-life issues. Since 
the program began, there have 
been five history labs offered 
in subjects like immigration 
law, and race and the criminal 
justice system.
“The larger goal is to arm 
our majors with impressive 
dossiers that go well beyond 
the 
older 
abstractions 
of 
‘primary research’ and ‘critical 
thinking,’” Cook wrote. “We 
are still really good at teaching 
those traditional skills, but 
they are hardly the limit of 
what we do.”
Although the number of 
students declaring a history 
major 
has 
declined 
since 
2000, Cook and Anne Berg, 
history lecturer and faculty 
adviser for the Undergraduate 
History Club, stressed that 
public interest in the study of 
history has actually increased 
in recent years. Berg said 
current politics and changes to 
the way history is taught have 
made people more inclined 
to educate themselves about 
where their situation stems 

from.
“To me, right now history is 
really really crucial because 
these sorts of watered-down, 
simplistic references to any 
given figure in the past in 
any 
development 
are 
just 
doing more harm than good,” 
Berg wrote. “To me, it seems 
that there is a real interest 
in the general public of how 
we got to where we are, and 
where certain references and 
rhetorical moves and legal 
precedents come from.”
Berg said the dwindling 
numbers of history majors do 
not reflect a lack of interest 
in the field, but are instead 
products of poor marketing.
“History has a problem— we 
don’t tend to market ourselves 
very well,” Berg wrote. “Most 
people think of history as 
stuffy old white guys. It’s an 
important image problem that 
the historical profession has, 
and you can see this across the 
United States with the decline 
in history majors and history 
students, and the decline in the 
humanities in general.”
Schmidt’s 
study 
found 
that drops in history majors 
were most significant among 
Asian-American 
students 
and at private universities, 
where tuition averages around 
$43,000 per year. Even so, both 
public and private universities 
have 
suffered 
decreasing 
numbers of history majors.

Cook 
pointed 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Wisconsin-
Stevens Point, where a proposal 
put 
forth 
by 
the 
school’s 
chancellor in November 2018 
suggested 
the 
elimination 
of the history major due a 
decrease in enrollment of more 
than 50 percent, as an example 
of the problematic decrease of 
history education at regional 
universities. At the University 
of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, 
around 46 percent of those 
enrolled are first-generation 
college students and many 
come 
from 
low-income 
backgrounds. 
Though 
Cook 
said 
the 
University 
does 
not 
face 
the same challenges as the 
University 
of 
Wisconsin-
Stevens Point, he described 
how the history department 
at the University is trying 
to appeal to students of all 
socioeconomic, 
racial 
and 
ethnic backgrounds.
“At 
places 
like 
Yale 
or 
Princeton, 
the 
number 
of 
history 
majors 
are 
very 
strong,” 
Cook 
wrote. 
“But 
what that suggests to us— 
and those who track this 
sort of data— is that students 
who 
come 
from 
affluent 
backgrounds don’t worry quite 
as much about future financial 
pressures as people going to, 
say, Wisconsin-Steven’s Point 
(sic). Moving forward, our goal 
is to ensure that traditional 

liberal arts majors like history 
or English or philosophy don’t 
become boutiquey majors that 
only affluent kids at places like 
Yale can feel confident about 
choosing.”
However, 
interest 
in 
graduate-level history degrees 
and doctoral programs has 
remained 
relatively 
steady 
despite 
decreased 
declared 
undergraduate history majors, 
Rackham 
student 
Zach 
Kopin said. Kopin, who leads 
the 
Graduate 
Organization 
of 
Students 
in 
History, 
highlighted how the doctoral 
program 
sometimes 
has 
too large of a cohort due to 
over-enrollment of accepted 
graduate students.
“We, over time, have to 
guess if we make a certain 
number of offers we’re going 
to get a certain number of 
acceptances,” 
Kopin 
said. 
“Some years that backfires. 
In 2009-2010, so many people 
accepted that there was not a 
cohort the next year.”
Kopin 
said 
the 
history 
department’s strength comes 
from its dedication to teaching 
communication and writing 
skills rather than a collection 
of facts.
“The value for us in history 
is that, I mean, it’s the cliché 
thing that you get to learn from 
the past, but we also teach 
transferable 
skills,” 
Kopin 
said. “Largely what we teach 

is 
actually 
communication. 
It’s not historical fact — we 
hope 
you 
remember 
the 
historical fact, but what we 
largely teach is different ways 
of communicating, whether it 
be oral presentation, putting 
together a slideshow or writing 
an essay, these are all different 
transferable skill sets that 
will affect you whether you go 
into public communications or 
whether you go into finance or 
you become a teacher.”
Echoing 
Kopin’s 
point, 
Cook explained the belief that 
history majors have limited 
employment 
opportunities 
or struggle to find a job after 
graduation is false, especially 
since the department stresses 
the importance of written and 
oral communication skills.
“The data is pretty clear — 
U-M LSA majors’ placement 
rate is about 96 percent, and 
Engineering, which you could 
argue is the most practical 
major of all, is 97 percent,” 
Cook wrote. “So it’s basically 
identical between our number 
one 
ranked 
engineering 
department and LSA majors 
like history. So a lot of this is 
a kind of messaging issue and 
getting students to understand 
and parents to understand 
that they’re not creating a 
kind of dangerous (outcome) 
for themselves if they choose 
to major in a liberal arts 
discipline like history.”

Harper: I’m disappointed for 
the fraternities that decided to 
disaffiliate. I think it was unwise. I 
think that’s pretty shameful. I can’t 
imagine a national organization 
knowing 
that 
the 
fraternities 
started on college campuses, have 
values related to college campuses 
and then would be encouraging 
students to disaffiliate from their 
University.
I think it’s misguided and it puts 
our students in harm’s way because 
one of the things that happens is 
in the disaffiliated groups, (there) 
is more risky behaviors. In the 
affiliated groups, they have the 
support of the University. They’ve 
got 
resources 
related 
to 
the 
University. They are programming 
and doing mental health safety, all 
those kinds of issues that ensure 
when students are having fun and 
are together, they are safer. And so I 
worry about that for the disaffiliated 
groups, I worry about an external 
organization that’s not connected 

to the University, actually doesn’t 
understand 
the 
policies 
and 
procedures of the University, trying 
to provide guidance and support. 
Not wise on so many levels, and I’m 
concerned from a health and safety 
perspective also. And proud of the 
ones that remained affiliated with 
the University. They are important. 
I think fraternities and sororities 
add value to the University and to 
the undergraduate experience. But 
we all know they come with some 
challenges. The more professional 
development, leadership training, 
those kinds of resources that we 
(the University) can provide, the 
better it is. … I’m hoping some of 
those fraternities will decide to 
re-affiliate with the University.
The relationship, the response, 
what I believe is the focus and 
commitment of students in those 
organizations (IFC and AAIC) and 
their nationals, is very different.
TMD: After a free speech 
watchdog group Speech First filed 
a lawsuit against the University’s 
use of the Bias Response Team last 
May, the University has restricted 
residential advisors and diversity 
peer educators from removing 

speech 
on 
student 
doors 
— 
including offensive language. Why 
was this specific decision made 
and how does the University plan 
to address potential issues with 
student climate in the dorms?
Harper: So let me say two 
things. One, we don’t suppress 
nor ignore speech … Secondly, we 
actually didn’t change the policy. 
One of the things that happens 
in a resident hall is that there is 
personal space, which might be 
space on your door (whiteboards) 
… there’s sort of community space 
where anybody can put something 
up or take it down, and then there’s 
space bulletin boards that the staff 
actually controls. And so what we 
tried to do last summer and what we 
continue to do is actually clarify the 
policy to make sure that our staff 
understood the difference between 
personal space — you can write 
whatever you want there — public 
space, and then the space they’re 
controlling.
When harm is being done or 
offensive speech occurs in the 
resident hall or anywhere, our 
goal is to respond and to have 
conversations about it and to invite 

the conversations. Because that’s 
what you do at an educational 
institution. You debate, you talk 
back and forth, we say, ‘What do 
you mean?’, ‘Did you intend?’ and 
so conversations like that happen 
all the time in housing and in 
classrooms and other places where 
there are students. … We have a 
group that responds to issue of 
climate. And so they are a response 
team, and so of course they are 
both concerned about the student 
who might have written or said 
something that was experienced 
as harmful, and the student who 
is experiencing it. So we try to 
actually have a conversation, or 
relationship or intervention with 
both sets of students. For us, that’s 
being an educational institution 
… we’re an educational institution 
where members of our community 
interact, and so we are always 
engaged in that conversation. But 
the intent really was to clarify to 
make sure the staff understood 
what the expectations were, not a 
change in policy.
TMD: Recently, the University 
announced a revision to the student 
sexual misconduct policy, wherein 

students take part in an in-person 
meeting between the accuser, the 
accused and any witnesses involved. 
Why did the University amend this 
policy? How does it aim to improve 
the general sexual misconduct 
policy? How does it respond to 
allegations that the revision benefits 
financially stable students who have 
the means to hire counsel?
Harper: We changed our policy 
and went to an interim policy on 
direction of a Sixth Circuit Court. 
So, this wasn’t a decision on the 
part of the University to even 
make it more challenging or to 
re-traumatize or any of the issues 
that are being talked about in the 
community. And we share those 
concerns, actually appealed, tried 
to help the court understand why 
this wasn’t in the best interest of our 
students. But in the end, we were 
told we needed to change our policy. 
So, we created an interim policy and 
we started working with student 
groups and others to figure out who 
ought to be doing the hearings, how 
do we minimize the negative impact 
on the students participating.
Right now, we are looking at 
having some hearing officers there 

who will actually help facilitate 
the discussion and manage the 
environment and the discussion. 
The attorneys won’t be asking the 
questions, but they can be there — 
both parties can have an advocate 
with them to help them. Depending 
on 
what 
the 
student 
needs, 
depending on what the complainant 
needs, they might be in the room, 
they might be in another setting, 
so we’re going to try to, on a case by 
case basis, figure out what’s best in 
that environment for students. The 
other thing we are doing, because 
some students might decide, ‘You 
know what, I am not doing this,’ 
we are also increasing and making 
sure that students understand that 
they can engage in an alternative 
resolution process, which would 
not have a hearing component. Both 
students have to agree, the idea is 
to work through what is going on 
with the students, and to engage in 
a restorative resolution, which does 
not include the hearing.

I

n 
my 
immigration 

law 
class 
this 
week, 

we 
watched 
a 
video 

about the Bracero 
Program, in which 
U.S. 
agriculture 

industrialists 
essentially 
recruited 
men 

from 
Mexico 

to 
do 
“stoop 

labor,” 
or 
the 

more 
undesirable 

farming 
jobs. 

The 
video 
was 

obviously a piece 
of propaganda created by the 
California Growers Council, 
attempting 
to 
assert 
the 

legitimacy of the Bracero 
Program. On the worksheet 
we were given to analyze 
the video, there was one 
question 
that 
seemed 
to 

baffle the whole class: “What 
was the role of women in the 
Bracero Program?” The only 
explicit reference to women 
in the video was when the 
video attempted to convince 
the American public that 
the 
Bracero 
Program 

benefited 
Americans: 

“Who benefits?” the video 
asks. “Housewives!” This, 
of course, references the 
fact that women do the 
grocery shopping, and the 
Bracero 
Program 
ensures 

that Americans can have 
fresh fruits and vegetables 
year round. When a student 
raised their hand and asked 
the 
professor 
what 
the 

deal was, he reminded us 
of the housewife comment, 
and then said, “You know, 
it’s interesting that we’re 
focusing so much on the 
male aspect of the Bracero 
Program, 
because 
there 

is a rich history of female 
Filipina 
and 
Mexican 

agricultural 
laborers 
and 

truck drivers who organized 
and unionized for fair wages 
and 
other 
labor 
rights.” 

Now, 
I 
don’t 
fault 
the 

professor for not telling us 
more: The polar vortex put 
everyone a week behind, and 
a lot of professors are still 
scrambling to make up the 
material. But that comment 
did get me thinking: Just 
how 
many 
women 
have 

been reduced to footnotes 
in the pages of history? 
How many women’s names 

have been lost to time — 
accomplishments 
forgotten 

by everyone except their 

children 
and 

grandchildren?

There’s 
a 

saying 
that 
gets 

circulated around 
the internet every 
so often, attributed 
to everyone from 
Marilyn Monroe to 
Eleanor Roosevelt, 
and 
it 
goes, 

“Well-behaved 
women 
seldom 

make 
history.” 
I 
see 

this 
quote 
everywhere, 

whether it’s being used to 
describe Susan B. Anthony 
or Cardi B. Whether it’s 
civil disobedience or just 
trying to have a good time, 

this quote resonates with 
so 
many 
women 
today, 

women hoping to escape the 
constraints put on them by 
society. The quote’s origins 
are not quite as famous as 
Marilyn 
Monroe: 
Laurel 

Thatcher Ulrich, a professor 
of 
American 
history 
at 

Harvard, coined the phrase 
in her 1976 paper “Vertuous 
Women Found: New England 
Ministerial 
Literature, 

1668-1735.” The context of 
the quote is a discussion 
of women in the highly 
religious, 
Protestant, 
and 

often Puritan, New England 
society. Cotton Mather, a 
prominent 
Puritan 
writer 

and my favorite witch hunter, 
called these women “the 
Hidden Ones,” women who 
hoped not to be remembered 
by history, but by God as they 
awaited eternal judgement, 
hoping that he saw their 
faith and piety on Earth. 
These women will not get 

roads, schools, town halls or 
buildings named after them, 
but they are the cornerstones 
on which their communities 
are built. They have quite 
literally made history.

“Every 
woman 
who’s 

ashamed of her body is a 
victim of torture,” writes 
playwright Carolyn Gage in 
“The Second Coming of Joan 
of Arc.” “Every woman who 
doubts her own judgement is 
a victim of torture. So how 
many women do you know 
who 
haven’t 
been 
pulled 

apart?”

Perhaps I ought to have 

a 
greater 
thesis 
about 

womanhood 
and 
what 
it 

means to break free from 
the 
constraints 
of 
being 

“well-behaved.” 
Perhaps 

I have something greater 
to say about the fact that 
women must be “likeable” 
to be leaders, that though 
women 
no 
longer 
wear 

corsets 
and 
hoop 
skirts, 

we are physically bound by 
the constraints of makeup 
and high heels necessary to 
perform femininity.

I’m sure somewhere in 

me, I do. But right now, 
I 
am 
mostly 
just 
tired. 

The performance of being 
a 
woman 
is 
exhausting. 

Many 
find 
comfort 
and 

empowerment 
in 
this 

performance, others delight 
in subverting with it and 
playing with what it means, 
and for that I commend 
them. But I am tired of this 
performance. I am tired of 
being pulled apart by what 
I am supposed to be. The 
women who made history, 
the ones who were not well-
behaved, were simply tired 
of being canaries in a coal 
mine. While we celebrate 
women who have broken the 
mold and have spoken out in 
the face of great opposition 
and violence, I wish we 
would also remember the 
women 
who 
fought 
the 

good fight in silence, who 
contributed 
what 
they 

could 
with 
the 
limited 

opportunities 
they 
had, 

without expecting anything 
in return.

KRYSTAL HUR | COLUMN

The strangest age of all

I 

turned 
20 
years 
old 

last month, and it was 
just 
as 
lackluster 
an 

experience 
as 
the 
other 

milestone 
birthdays 
that 

films like “Sixteen Candles” 
and “Hannah Montana: The 
Movie” promised would be 
exciting. Like the elusive 
Sweet 16 bash that no one 
seems to actually host in 
real life, my 20th birthday 
lacked 
any 
fanfare 
that 

would perhaps be expected 
from a day that signaled 
my graduation from being a 
teenager to being in my 20s. 
It’s not that I was expecting 
to 
have 
a 
big 
party 
or 

celebration; I’m not a huge 
fan of either, and I enjoyed 
the cozy night in that my 
friends and I had to celebrate. 
However, I had expected to 
feel a little older and perhaps 
more like an adult as a result.

Instead, 
turning 
20 

only brought forth a whole 
new set of questions and 
insecurities to supplement 
the 
ones 
Ihad 
already 

accumulated over my teenage 
years. I almost feel like I’m 
in the beginning stages of a 
quarter-life crisis; I’m 20, 
and yet it feels as though 
I haven’t accomplished as 
much as I should have. I’ve 
also realized that most of 
my 
accomplishments 
are 

tied to my academic career, 
which is great for my resume, 
but useless otherwise. As 
cliché 
and 
unnecessarily 

dramatic as this question 
is, if someone were to make 
a tombstone for me today, 
what would be written on it? 
“Well-rounded student”? Or 
maybe, “Involved in several 
extracurriculars”?

Other 
than 
bringing 

forth a slew of unanswerable 
questions, 
being 
20 
also 

just feels awkward because 
I’m not a teenager but still 
can’t legally drink. While 
I don’t feel like a child 
anymore (which I’m aware 
is something that a child 
would say), and I haven’t 
in a while, I certainly don’t 
feel like an adult either. I’m 
not expecting to suddenly 

feel like an adult once I turn 
21, but being able to drink 
legally is at least some kind 
of noticeable way in which 
my growing older will be 
recognized. Such a change is 
nonexistent when turning 20. 
Being stripped of teenage-
hood 
doesn’t 
count 
since 

it doesn’t do anything but 
cause a shift in demographic 
placement and contribute to 
an identity crisis. I’m sure 
I’m not alone in feeling like 
I’m 
in 
limbo, 
somewhere 

between being a real adult 
and a child — like I’m floating 

between two distinct age 
groups I’m excluded from.

The truth is, though, that 

I do belong in an age group — 
I’m in my 20s. This has also 
lent itself to revelations that 
made me feel simultaneously 
extremely young and old. 
Celebrities, whom I grew 
up watching on screen and 
therefore always perceived 
as being much older, can 
now be classified in the same 
age group as me. Jennifer 
Lawrence and I are both 
in our 20s. So are Taylor 
Swift and Emma Watson. 
They were teens when I was 
in elementary school, and 
entered their 20s at about the 
time I celebrated having an 
age that was two digits, and 
now we’re in the same age 
group. We won’t be for long, 
since they will inevitably 
enter their 30s, but that only 
serves as a reminder that the 
next time I enter a new age 
group will be when I turn 30 

— only 10 years away.

My friends also expressed 

similar feelings regarding my 
age on my birthday, quipping 
that I’m “so old” now. These 
friends are all younger than 
me or are 19 going on 20 this 
year, and I have no doubt 
that 
my 
birthday 
caused 

them to realize that they, 
too, will leave their teenage 
years 
sooner 
rather 
than 

later. Their reactions show 
that I’m not only the one 
who feels this way. Being 20 
is a pregame for adulthood, 
and it invokes contradictory 
feelings and thoughts for a 
lot of people, it seems. I’m 
sure there are people who 
have no such thoughts when 
turning 20, but the majority 
of us are probably cognizant 
of what it represents: the 
last stretch in the transition 
between 
childhood 
and 

adulthood. After we cross 
that last stretch, there’s no 
going 
back. 
Whether 
we 

choose to act like adults or 
not, the law will eventually 
bestow us with privileges 
reserved 
only 
for 
people 

who are supposedly mature 
enough to handle them.

Being 20 isn’t a hardship, 

and the quirks that come with 
it aren’t tangibly burdensome. 
Since my birthday has passed, 
I don’t think about my age too 
often, either. It’s more just a 
strange detail about myself 
that confuses me when I do 
remember. I’m starting to 
believe that the reason people 
are so eager to turn 21 isn’t 
because they want to be able 
to drink legally, but because 
doing so lifts the last of 
age-related bans and firmly 
sends them into adulthood. 
At 21, I can drink legally, 
buy cigarettes and I can even 
apply to be on “The Bachelor” 
(though the franchise’s last 
few choices of bachelors have 
been discouraging, to say 
the least). But to put reality 
shows aside, I hope turning 
21 isn’t as disappointing as 
turning 20.

“

Take a deep breath,” my 
mom used to say.

This 
was 
always 

one of the first suggestions 
offered when I would come 
to my mom about how I was 
overwhelmed — when I did 
not know how to approach 
the ominous to-do list that 
sometimes felt too daunting 
to begin.

As I later realized, the 

things I had to get done were 
not truly as scary as they 
appeared, but rather very 
possible, once I got past the 
initial fear factor. As life 
moved on, my tasks began 
to pile up, and the number 
of commitments I had grew, 
but, 
following 
my 
mom’s 

advice, I felt like everything 
was 
within 
reason 
if 
I 

approached everything with 
a sense of calm.

Coming to college, this 

to-do list grew even more. 
I 
suddenly 
found 
myself 

rushing around at a rate 
I had never experienced. 
The 
regimented, 
stable 

schedule of the past was 
no longer, but rather, life 
had become always subject 
to change. It was not the 
level of involvement or the 
inconsistency of my schedule 
that became difficult for me, 
but finding time for myself.

As we find ourselves in 

the throes of the semester, 
with 
midterm 
exams, 

papers, 
projects 
and 

other commitments, I can 

personally attest to the fact 

that I have pushed self-care 
to the side. Things get busier, 
there are higher stakes on 
assignments and the general 
amounts of work and snow 
simultaneously continue to 
pile up. I understand that 
the hectic nature of college 
is to be expected. I also 

understand 
that 
handling 

this does not pose a quandary 
for everyone, but I feel like 
in the hustle and bustle of 
every day, I forget to take 
five minutes to just be.

Recently, 
my 
friends 

and I were recapping our 
days and arrived at this 
realization 
that, 
in 
this 

high-stress time, we could 
not remember the last time 
that 
any 
of 
us 
stopped, 

took 
a 
deep 
breath 
and 

maybe even did something 
for 
ourselves. 
Maybe 
we 

forget 
sometimes. 
Maybe, 

in the midst of everything, 
it does not register that 
even the slightest means of 
slowing 
our 
productivity 

is 
a 
possibility. 
We 
can 

press pause, and remember 
that, for example, sleeping, 
watching 
an 
episode 
of 

television, 
listening 
to 
a 

podcast or going on a run — 
though not when it’s too icy 
— are all things that can help 
make our to-do lists a little 
less daunting and improve 
morale in the process.

Taking time for ourselves 

does not have to be a grand 
heist of time or resources; it 
can be something small. It 
does not have to hinder our 
abilities to finish our work or 
attend that meeting, but can 
be an incentive to get those 
things done.

This semester has proved 

the 
busiest 
I 
have 
ever 

had and has led me to the 
understanding 
that 
there 

is always something else to 
work on. There is always an 
exam to prepare for or an 
event to attend. Those things 
are not going to go away. 
But it is actively choosing to 
sometimes prioritize my own 
well-being — my need for a 
break — that will serve as the 

most beneficial in the long 
term.

I feel as though in this 

bubble in which we live here 
at the University of Michigan, 
sometimes it is easy for me to 
forget that I can take a step 
back. I do have the choice to 
make time for myself, even 
if it feels like said time is 
a luxury, because though 
it may not be finishing my 
paper 20 minutes sooner, 
I will equally benefit from 
giving myself that break and 
doing something to break up 
the routine.

It is with this that I 

challenge myself to make 
time, to put my work to the 
side and give myself the time 
and space to decompress 
before continuing on. Being 
completely candid, this is 
something that I am fairly 
vocal 
about 
but 
struggle 

with in practice. Moving 
forward, into the rest of 
the semester, onto the next 
and into life, I know that 
stressors 
will 
be 
forever 

present, 
and 
expectations 

will always accompany them. 
With this, I want to begin to 
form this positive habit of 
giving myself the option to 
take a break, or break with 
the schedule that seems so 
logistically coordinated that 
there could not possibly be 
a moment to stop. As tasks 
become checks in the box, 
I have to remember that my 
well-being 
and 
ability 
to 

feel as though I can handle 
everything that comes my 
way is the most important, 
even if making time for 
myself is as simple as just 
taking a deep breath.

Take some time

Tuesday, February 26, 2019 — 5

Sarah 
Fennel 
is 
on 
the 
precipice of a major inflection 
point in her career. Her fourth, 
actually. An impressive figure 
made even more impressive by 
the relative brevity of her career, 
Sarah is a food blogger and 
the creator of Broma Bakery, a 
popular 
mostly-baking 
blog 
dedicated to visually impressive 
yet 
accessible 
recipes. 
But 
before her career started, there 
was of course that first point of 
change, which happened to take 
place here, at the University of 
Michigan.
Sarah had spent the first two 
years of college at New York 
University, but found herself 
overwhelmed and unsatisfied. 
“I just found myself feeling 
really depressed there, to be 
honest. I felt like the students 
were not what I expected,” 
Fennel said, in an interview 
with The Daily. While there, 
she decided to create a blog as a 
means of fulfillment and a way 
to combat the unhappiness she 
was feeling. “I was like, let’s do 
something fun and creative.”
But after completing her 
sophomore fall semester at 
NYU she was still dissatisfied 
with her surroundings, so she 
decided to take some time to 
reassess.
During this time-off, she 
visited the University. Not to 
view the campus, but to spend 
time with friends from high 
school. While all hanging out 
in a dorm room, her friend’s 
roommate casually suggested 
she should apply. The roommate 
herself was a transfer student, 
and assured Fennel that it was 
“the easiest application process 
ever.” So she applied, but had no 
serious intention of going. 
But, as life would have it, 
she got in. “I basically was 
faced with the decision of: Do 
I go back to something that has 
made me unhappy in the past or 
do I try something new? And so 
I just decided to go for it.”
While 
at 
the 
University, 
Fennel 
majored 
in 
anthropology. 
“I 
loved 
anthropology, and biological 
anthropology 
in 
particular, 
because it examined humans 
in a way that bridged evolution 
with our intrinsic behaviors. 
I find it fascinating that we all 
have individual desires and 
goals, and yet somehow we’re 
so interconnected that we can 
evolve together as an entire 
species based on collective 
interest.” All the while, she 
continued to work on her blog, 
which at that time functioned 
similar to an online diary. “(I 
was not writing that much) 
and it was not a lot of original 
recipes, I would recreate things 
other people had made. And it 
was just baking.”
After graduation, she took a 
job as the catering coordinator 
at Sava’s. But after a year at that 
position she felt burned out. “I 
sorta had a quarter-life-crisis. 
Or a 22-year-old crisis. Where 
I felt like I wanted to shift my 
focus onto doing something 
more like myself,” explains 
Fennel. “I was working super 
hard and not really reaping the 
benefits in terms of being able 
to go home at the end of the day 
and being like, ‘I created that.’ It 

was creating for someone else.”
So she quit her job. And for 
the second time she decided to 
take a leap. She gave herself two 
months to try to build her blog 
into something. “I really feel 
like because I had nothing to 
fall back on, in terms of — I had 
never made any money on my 
blog, I didn’t really have any job 
to go into if this wasn’t working 
out — it just made me work even 
harder.”
Her hard work translated 
into success. In one year, she 
went from 30,000 pageviews 
to 200,000 pageviews, and her 
Instagram following increased 
from 600 to 10,000 followers. 
But even with the success, 
the transition was at times 

daunting. “There was really 
this gradual shift of worrying 
what I was going to do next 
month, and where the money 
was going to come from and 
just feeling like an imposter. (It 
wasn’t until) around the two 
year mark when I had had this 
momentum where the business 
was continuing to function, that 
that fear subsided. It wasn’t 
until then that I really started 
to feel truly confident in my 
work.”
After working at the blog 
full-time for about three years, 
Fennel once more made a 
shift in her career, this time 
by 
launching 
an 
additional 
business, Foodtography School, 
a 
four-week 
virtual 
food 
photography 
course, 
where 
students 
are 
taught 
about 
subjects such as composition, 
light and color, as well as 

marketing and social media.
This expansion into online 
courses was not premeditated, 
though in some ways it was a 
long time coming. Fennel was 
constantly 
inundated 
with 
emails from readers asking 
her for help and resources on 
food photography. “So I started 
creating blog posts about food 
photography 
and 
teaching 
people how to edit, and my tips 
for compositions, and I what 
I used for lenses and camera 
recommendations and things 
like that.” But it was clear that 
there was opportunity beyond 
that. One day Fennel’s assistant 
pulled her aside, “[She said:] 
‘Sarah, you need to do a food 
photography workshop, there’s 
never going to be a perfect time 
to do it, you just need to tell the 
world you’re doing one and plan 
it.’ And we did, and it was a huge 
success. It sold out in four days.”
After 
dinner 
one 
night 
during this initial workshop, an 
attendee told Fennel she should 
consider turning the seminar 
into an online course. “I had 
come out of the workshop and 
had netted like $10,000 and 
I was like, yeah! Whatever, 
I’m a millionaire, I’m good,” 
Fennel said with a laugh. But a 
few months later that attendee 
followed 
up 
and 
doubled 
down—she 
had 
started 
her 
own business teaching others 
how to create online courses, 
and thought Fennel should 
seriously look into it. So the two 
had a few calls on the subject, 
and Fennel eventually ended 
up bringing her onboard as a 
consultant. In the year since 
launch, Foodtography School 
has been such a smash hit 
that Fennel has expanded it to 
include two additional courses, 
a more advanced version of the 
original course and a restaurant 
food photography course.
One interesting consequence 
of the “foodtography” course is 
that she’s been able to speak to 
her readers and followers more 
directly. “The most interesting 
thing,” Fennel notes, “has been 
seeing how much people are 
craving content that is related 
but 
not 
necessarily 
food-
centric. They want advice on 
how to grow their own business. 
They want advice on how I stay 
fit while eating real sugar and 
butter. They want to see how I 
decorate my home and things 
like that. And people are just 
asking for those types of content 
at a rate that now feels like we 
would be doing a service to not 
offer that kind of content.” 
Herein lies Fennel’s fourth, 
and most recent shift: She’s 
refocusing the brand to be a 
more encompassing food and 
lifestyle brand that will venture 
into personal asides, such as 
how to stay fit while eating, 
in her words, “real sugar and 
butter,” as well as pieces on 
how she decorates her home. 
In the next nine months she 
plans to roll out new content 
and test what works best with 
her readers and followers. “I’ve 
teased this idea a few times on 
my Instagram stories (and) on 
my Instagram feed, to really 
get a sense of what people are 
looking for. It’s going to be 
trial and error. We’ll see what 
performs best. We’ll see what 
people enjoy the most and are 
asking for more of. And really 
go from there.”

It’s the era of Trump and we 
love to talk about it. Politics 
are everywhere (which is not 
necessarily a bad thing). Mark 
Doten’s “Trump Sky Alpha” 
represents a growing trend in 
literature where these politics, 
especially Trumpism and social 
media hypnosis, dare to foray 
into prose. It’s the new vogue 
for literature, apparently, to 
write explicitly about politics 
in fiction, with a splash of books 
in the last year that try to tackle 
just what the hell is going on. 
Certainly, these experiments 
can be delightful when done 
correctly. 
Subtle 
political 
suggestion can coexist alongside 
literature 
just 
fine. 
Socially 
relevant themes can deliver 
thoughtful messages and can 
bolster plot.
Doten’s novel, unfortunately, 
does not quite do any of this. 
Even before the halfway mark 
in “Trump Sky Alpha,” it’s clear 
that “Trump” is just another 
paragon of the overworked, 
poorly-veiled 
pandering 
that 
seems to have soaked into 
the pages of some new wave 
literature. It’s a muddled world 
(and a desperately familiar one) 
where President Trump, riding 
his blimp above the United 
States, declares nuclear war in 
the days after a hacker group 
shuts down the internet and 
stomps the world into havoc. 
Ivanka is on her knees crying, 
too. Most everyone worldwide 
dies in ensuing bombings.
Doten restrains himself here, 
though, and stops “Trump” 
before it can become merely an 
apocalyptic thriller (at least in 
the first half of the book — more 
on this later). “Trump” instead 
focuses on Rachel, a journalist 
living 
in 
a 
containment 
center some months after the 
destruction of the world. When 
she receives a call from an old 
boss asking her to write a piece on 
internet humor pre-doomsday to 
bolster the fragmented remains 
of US journalism, she agrees, 
given that she’ll be able to visit 
the location where her dead 
wife and daughter are buried. 
So, Rachel throws in the towel 
with her fellatio partner at the 
containment center and heads to 
the facility where the remains of 

the internet are held.
Once 
Rachel 
surveys 
the 
corpses of Twitter and Reddit, 
though, things of course go 
terrifically wrong, and she is 
implicated in a scheme to find 
Birdcrash, the man responsible 
for the initial crash of the 
internet. The government forces 
her to join the hunt for him, 
which lasts a brief 10 or so 
pages, before Birdcrash himself 
captures 
Rachel 
and 
starts 
torturing her. Birdcrash talks 
about Trump and drips acid on 
Rachel. It’s a lot. It’s a mess.
Doten proves quite easily that 
he is meme-savvy. He evidences 
that he is a cool, woke kid, a 

part of the 2019 resistance, 
and I am supposed to feel cool 
by association. The internet 
archives Doten imagines from 
the last day of the world feel 
eerily familiar — folks blaming 
jihadists, 
using 
(surprisingly 
accurate) memes and hashtags to 
eschew fears. It’s a well done and 
probably realistic imagining.
Sadly, when this passage is 
complete and Rachel is done 
looking through the archives, 
readers are back in the mess of 
“Trump.” 
Maybe most detrimental are 
Doten’s characters, particularly 
that 
of 
Rachel, 
who 
feels 
shockingly underdeveloped. It 
is difficult to believe that she is 
traversing the nuclear-wrecked 
country 
and 
agreeing 
to 
dangerous government missions 
solely to see the resting place of 
her family. And Doten doesn’t 
even give the opportunity to 
see if this is, in fact, believable 
— 
Rachel 
rarely 
interacts 
with someone, there are few 
flashbacks 
or 
information 
revealed from her past and 
her actions feel arbitrary and 
without 
thought. 
The 
plot 
simply isn’t linear enough to 
understand 
Rachel’s 
psyche. 

Readers don’t even get to see 
their main character develop. 
Rather, Rachel feels like a 
faceless pawn, one that Doten 
uses to relay the absurdities of 
“Trump Sky Alpha.”
It 
seems, 
strangely, 
that 
Doten could not decide if he was 
writing satire or not. Instead of 
committing to a theme, “Trump” 
oscillates between Vonnegut-
esque satire (Trump’s daily blimp 
that features moving chairs so 
everyone can catch a glimpse 
of the president) and what feels 
like a failed but genuine attempt 
at an action novel (dripping acid 
through holes in someone’s skull 
until they manage to fight back). 
While reading, it was difficult 
to come to terms with the very 
fact that “Trump” features a 
real-world cast of characters. 
There is no message to fight for 
while reading, no satire to even 
interpret. It is merely an author 
showing the world what he can 
do in his writing (which is not 
necessarily what he should do).
By the final quarter of the 
book, 
“Trump 
Sky 
Alpha” 
devolves into a rambling chaos. 
These pages are filled almost 
exclusively with dialogue from 
Birdcrash, the person behind 
the internet hacks, who has 
captured Rachel and seems 
intent on torturing her while 
mumbling gibberish. Not one 
page of this was cohesive or 
conducive 
to 
some 
sort 
of 
meaning. Birdcrash speaks in a 
plural form, describing to Rachel 
encounters of gay intercourse, 
cancer and a sexually abusive 
father whom he likens to Trump. 
Even if this is meant to be some 
sort of mockery of politics, there 
is nothing to be gained from 
it. It is simply bad. Perhaps I 
am supposed to be impressed 
that an author is willing to talk 
explicitly about penile pain and 
poppers and “dank memes.” I 
was not.
Truthfully, 
what 
potential 
“Trump Sky Alpha” had at its 
start is quickly eroded. There is 
a political fear driving the novel, 
one that many of us feel, but its 
fervor is dulled by endlessly 
random statements. These are 
obviously intended to prove 
that Doten is cutting-edge and 
has a grasp of the internet and 
its implications. But this is not 
enough to form a novel. For most 
of “Trump,” Doten seems to be 
writing simply for the hell of it.

‘Trump Sky Alpha’ proves 
the ultra-modern can fail

STYLE INTERVIEW

COURTESY OF THE ARTIST

In the year 
since launch, 
Foodtography 
School as been 
such a smash 
hit that Fennel 
has expanded 
it to include 
two additional 
courses, a more 
advanced version 
of the original 
course and a 
restaurant food 
photography 
course.

So, it’s been about an hour of 
sweaty, bass-thumping dancing at a 
house party that, in most respects, 
is identical to every other one I’ve 
ever been to. I walk outside to 
get some fresh air (and maybe a 
welcome whiff of cigarette smoke) 
when a friend approaches me 
complaining that a girl she clearly 
“cancelled” is still following her 
“finsta,” or “fake Instagram.”
Let me dial this back a little bit.
In fact, let’s dial it back all the 
way to 2011. I’m in middle school 
and I have just heard of a fledgling 
social media app called Instagram. 
In those tweeny days, most people 
I knew were active users on 
Facebook. However, as Facebook 
was becoming the conventional 
platform of choice, Instagram 
represented the Wild, Wild West: 
lawless with these new things 
called filters.
I 
remember 
the 
days 
of 
Instagram when it was OK to post 
10 photos of the donuts you just 
bought and then — that same day 
— post another photo of yourself 
eating pizza. With no etiquette 
established, 
Instagram 
was 
a 
free-for-all. Some would even 
nostalgically consider this age of 1:1 
aspect ratios and endless troves of 
tacky selfies the platform’s “Golden 
Age.”
Simultaneously, as Instagram 
was breaking new grounds, the 
godfather of social media (and 
ironically, now Instagram’s parent 
company) Facebook was being 

decried as “dead.”
As the first social media platform 
to gain international ubiquity, 
Facebook had changed since its 
college-student-only origins. In 
2011, parents were starting to 
make Facebook accounts, which, 
as with any trend, can only signify 
waning cultural relevance. Ads 
were increasing their presence and, 
worst of all, people were actually 
beginning to put effort into things 
posted. Instagram provided relief 
from the increasing formality of 
Facebook. It was an oasis for the 
younger generation to express 
themselves fully.
Now, fast forward to today. 
Facebook and Instagram still exist, 
yet things have changed. Facebook 
has become the “serious” platform 
used by all age demographics. 
However, as a result of the presence 
of everyone from your mom to 
your high school literature teacher, 
Facebook has descended into a 
realm that seems to be dominated 
solely 
by 
political 
bickering 
and other formal matters. The 
discourse can sometimes be so 
heated that it makes sense why 
Russian hackers would infiltrate 
it as a means to influence the 2016 
Presidential election. Similarly, the 
innocuous Instagram of 2011 seems 
unimaginable in today’s culture of 
“influencers” and brand-crafting. 
Just like the Facebook of yore, 
people actually give a shit about 
what they post. This increasing 
formality has prompted some 
users to declare Instagram “dead” 
as well. In fact, it has become so 
formal that some users have moved 

to other image-sharing platforms 
like Vsco or Pinterest as a means 
to express themselves without 
judgement; some have even created 
“finstagrams.”
Finstagram, a portmanteau of 
“fake” and “Instagram,” ironically 
is the place where users feel as 
though they can be at their realest. 
As a reaction to the growing 
pressure of image control on 
Instagram, users have begun to 
open up side accounts. These side 
accounts, in contrast to the mains, 
are not under the user’s real name. 
In fact, finsta account names are 
normally derived from a pun or an 
inside joke based on the person’s 
name. Rather than letting anyone 
who wants to follow you, only 
your closest friends are allowed 
to access yout finsta. With these 
privacy precautions in place, the 
finsta has become the perfect 
place to reveal your true thoughts, 
tell embarrassing stories, talk shit 
about whoever, etc.
This 
article 
is 
not 
about 
Instagram or Facebook, but a 
phenomenon that affects social 
media in general. If we naturally 
run from increasing formality, why 
does it continue to appear on every 
social media platform that gains 
popularity? It is a sad reality that as a 
function of time and success, social 
media platforms will all inevitably 
lose their harmless and youth-
dominated origins in the process. 
It seems to be a consequence of 
the fact that participation in social 
media is quickly transforming from 
a voluntary activity to a chore, a job, 
an economic resource.

Saturday night and Sunday 
afternoon the Detroit Symphony 
Orchestra brought to a close 
their 2019 midwinter festival, 
“American 
Panorama,” 
with 
a program of music by three 
American minimalist composers, 
Steve Reich, Philip Glass and 
John 
Luther 
Adams. 
Aptly 
titled “Maximum Minimal,” the 
program embraced one of the 
defining currents in American 
classical music of the last half 
century.
It’s 
an 
interesting 
theme, 
and one that is ripe with both 
possibilities 
and 
challenges. 
Minimalism, after all, is a term 
that emcompasses a wide swath 
of 
composers 
and 
aesthetics, 
and programing a single concert 
dedicated to it would necessarily 
require the omission of some of 
the most interesting and evocative 
music to fall under that category. 
To do true justice to the theme one 
would really need to dedicate an 
entire festival to minimalism itself, 
rather than one concert as part of 
a larger festival — but under the 
circumstances the DSO and Music 
Director Laurate Leonard Slatkin 
have done reasonably well with 
the programming, in the sense 
that the three pieces selected for 
the performance touch on some of 
the most prominent trends within 
minimalism.
The 
“American 
Panorama” 
festival itself, of course, was quite 
an undertaking.
“This is the sixth (midwinter 
festival) that I’ve done,” Slatkin 
told me when we spoke over 
the phone last week. Initially 
conceived as a way to draw in 
audiences during a traditionally-
lean 
month 
for 
orchestra 
attendance, the DSO began with 
endeavors such as performing all 
nine of Beethoven’s symphonies 
over the course of a few weeks. 
Last year the orchestra undertook 
a French music themed festival. 
And this year, American music — 
a longtime interest of Slatkin’s — 
came to the fore.
“What we have learned is that 
this period of time, these three 

weeks in February, have proved 
to be both artistically satisfying 
and very lucrative in terms of 
being able to attract an audience,” 
Slatkin said.
This year’s festival will likely 
be the last midwinter festival with 
Slatkin at the helm, as he has been 
stepping away from his duties as 
music director.
“I’ll be 75 soon, and it’s a lot of 
work,” Slatkin said. “(But) I wanted 
(my last midwinter festival) to 
be dedicated to American music, 
which makes sense, because it’s 
been one of my passions for years.”
The 
opener 
of 
Saturday’s 
program 
was 
Steve 
Reich’s 
“Clapping 
Music,” 
a 
short 
1972 
composition 
performed 
entirely by clapping. Written for 
two people, “Clapping Music” 
serves as an excellent example 
of rhythmic minimalism, and 
also an early example of Reich’s 
technique of “phasing,” which he 
developed further in subsequent 
compositions. 
Throughout 
the duration of the piece, one 
performer claps a single rhythmic 
line over and over, while the 
other performer claps this same 
rhythmic line except offset by 
one eighth note every eight or 
12 bars. This process continues 
until the performers are once 
again clapping in unison, as in the 
beginning of the piece.
For being such a far cry from 
what one generally expects to 
hear at an orchestral concert, 
the audience received the piece 
enthusiastically, 
many 
people 
leaping to their feet at the end 
of Joseph Becker and Andres 
Pichardo’s 
performance 
on 
Saturday night, which was tight 
and controlled.
The Reich was followed by 
a lessor-known work of Philip 
Glass’s, the “Concerto Fantasy for 
Two Timpanists and Orchestra” 
(which, as an aside, often bears 
striking 
similarities 
to 
music 
from “Mission Impossible”). The 
choice of a timpani concerto is 
somewhat odd, but also bold, 
given the relative historical lack 
of music in that genre. The playing 
on Saturday night’s performance 
was skillful and well-executed, but 
some of the inherent difficulties of 
performing a timpani concerto 

nevertheless shown through. The 
balance between the orchestra and 
soloists was a constant challenge, 
and often it was a strain to hear 
the orchestra over the sheer force 
of the timpani banging away at 
the front of the stage. Which isn’t 
to say the banging wasn’t exciting, 
and indeed the timpani cadenza in 
the third movement was probably 
the most compelling part of the 
piece, as the listener stopped 
being distracted by the fact that 
they couldn’t hear the orchestra 
and could focus on the thrilling 
technique and sensitive touch 
displayed by soloists Jeremy Epp 
and James Ritchie.
Far 
and 
away 
the 
most 
compelling 
performance 
of 
the night, however, fell to the 
last piece of the evening, John 
Luther Adams’s “Become Ocean,” 
a 
meditative 
and 
immersive 
42-minute work for full orchestra 
which, when I spoke with him in 
2015, Adams described as “the 
culmination of years of work 
… (where) the music has been 
leading (him) ... for decades.” Kept 
at a single tempo for the entire 
duration of the work, the orchestra 
is divided physically into three 
groups on stage — the strings, 
the woodwinds and the brass. 
Throughout the course of the 
piece, each of these sections slowly 
fades in and out of prominence, 
each 
playing 
slow, 
repetitive 
patterns and swelling chords that 
imitate the movement of waves in 
the open ocean. Listening to it, one 
feels submerged in the texture, 
floating in its resonance, borne 
aloft by the slow-moving mass of 
its sound. The DSO augmented the 
meditative nature of this listening 
experience 
with 
the 
tasteful 
application 
of 
stage 
lighting, 
applying a separate soft-hued 
color to each orchestra section and 
intensifying or dimming the light 
in accordance with the section’s 
change in volume.
It was a satisfying end to the 
“American Panorama” festival, 
and all the more so because it was 
a concert featuring exclusively 
living 
composers. 
“American 
music,” it seemed to say, “is a thing 
that is alive and among us.” Let’s 
hope that programing like this 
continues to come to the fore.

DSO takes on 
‘Become Ocean’

DAYTON HARE
Daily Classical Music Columnist

Since her successful 2017 debut 
with SweetSexySavage, Kehlani’s life 
has shifted into the media spotlight. 
From a (disproven) cheating scandal 
involving 
ex 
Kyrie 
Irving 
and 
PartyNextDoor to scrutiny over her 
sexual orientation, Kehlani’s love life 
has garnered particularly invasive 
attention. She’s faced a lot of love and 
a lot of heartbreak over these last few 
years, and none of it was private. For 
these reasons her announcement of 
her pregnancy in October came as a 
shock. “i don’t want to hide,” she wrote 
in her twitter announcement. “i want 
to walk around belly out everywhere.”
A lot of these ideas manifest 
themselves into her most recent release 
While We Wait. If SweetSexySavage 
introduced her as a strong-willed, 
sexy and intelligent woman to the 
world, 
her 
sophomore 
attempt 
destabilizes this immaculately cool 
image. A nine track mixtape, half of 
it collaborations, shows a less self-
assured Kehlani, more vulnerable. But 
she’s okay with that. And whereas the 
ambition with SweetSexySavage was 
to churn out confident, radio-friendly 
bangers, While We Wait is less lavish, 
making greater use of negative space 
and sparse, wispy instrumentals. It 
feels more genuine this time around.
Sonically, the album is dynamic, 
with its tone, pace and energy scaling 
the board. It finds cohesion in its 
ability to strip away layers from songs 
just as fast as it builds them. It starts 
with the sound of trickling water in 
the intro track “Footsteps” and builds 
from there, a soothing, whimsical 
backbone to every song. This adds 
more character to Kehlani’s artistry, 
providing a greater sense of character 
to her musical identity; despite some 

trivial, superficial ’90s R&B worship, 
tropey genre conventions aren’t too 
prominent.
There’s an elegant deliberation 
to the sound of this album. The 
instrumentation perfectly parallels 
the lyrical content at some points. The 
trickling water from the beginning 
actually ties to a metaphor of a 
relationship slipping away like cupped 
water. There are also points where 
the sounds change the meaning of the 
songs. This is most prominent in “Love 
Language,” a song that details a desire 
to better understand a new partner. 
However, the song carries the cadence 
of a nursery rhyme, suggesting it 
references her situation as a new 
mother.
More than anything, While We 
Wait serves as a snapshot to the 
emotions that tag along the turmoil 

of new changes. Songs like “Nunya” 
are scathing, challenging a former 
lover. “Why you worried ’bout who 
was fuckin’ me?” Yet more endearing 
and personal cuts like “RPG” coexist, 
admitting “you told me I’m beautiful/ 
‘cause I told you you don’t tell me 
enough.” But the album far from 
veers into extremities; it captures the 
elegance of lingering between security 
and doubt despite its meager tracklist. 
“Morning Glory” is a quirkier track, 
with lyrics like “this ain’t BK, you 
can’t have it your way,” dedicated to 
a male partner who may judge her 
appearance 
beneath 
the 
morning 
makeup glam.

That 
being 
said, 
the 
album, 
from a thematic viewpoint, is a bit 
derivative. “Morning Glory,” despite 
its charm, isn’t at all profound in the 
sentiments it conveys. The same goes 
for much of the rest of the album; it’s 
ideas surrounding romantic love are 
shallow and redundant, with constant 
iterations of “take it or leave it” and 
“I’m sorry” attached to nearly every 
song. Despite the length, the concepts 
explored by the album stale not too far 
into it, the second song “Too Deep” a 
subpar echo of “Footsteps.” This isn’t 
to say Kehlani’s ideas and the way she 
expresses them aren’t original — they 
are — she simply misses the mark in 
expressing anything we haven’t heard 
before.
Characteristic for mixtapes — and 
not Kehlani — are the number of 
features on this album. Surprisingly, 
they dodge the trap of cheapening 
the content or serving as any sort of 
promotional boost for any of the artists 
involved (not to say the potential isn’t 
there). The inclusion of Ty Dolla $ign 
on “Nights Like This” adds a duality 
to the album, emphasizing the role of 
bisexual love in Kehlani’s life, as both 
artists croon to the story of a mutual 
female lover. Jazz icon Musiq Soulchild 
on the other hand, is deterministically 
in his element throughout “Footsteps,” 
adding a slick, buttery quality to the 
smooth track. Nonetheless, this isn’t 
to say all collaborations on the album 
proved necessary. Dom Kennedy on 
“Nunya” is forgettable, his verse void 
of the artistic and emotional energy of 
the song.
Overall, While We Wait serves as a 
strong follow up to the brilliance that 
is SweetSexySavage. Despite veering 
away from her traditional sound, her 
sophomore attempt conveys more 
personality and shows potential for 
even more growth as her life and 
understanding of it changes.

There’s 
something 
wonderfully 
charming 
about 
that perfect cup of coffee. 
For so many of us, coffee is so 
much more than a drink — it’s 
a stirring inside our chest, the 
first taste that graces our lips 
every day, waking us with the 
sun. It is common ground for 
conversation, 
for 
overcoming 
challenges, for wordless displays 
of tenderness and exhausted 
gestures of affection. Coffee is 
not a beverage; it is a necessity, 
it is a tradition, it is a heritage. 
We drink coffee for the jolt and 
the ritual of it all, not just for its 
lovable, distinct flavor. No matter 
how ever changing our worlds, 
coffee is a tradition. Above all, 
coffee is a staple of American 
culture and lifestyle.
For the many who don’t rely 
on a Keurig or, perhaps, a fancy 
espresso machine to bring us a 
morning, mid-afternoon or oh 
shit I’m pulling an all nighter cup 
of Joe, the places that we choose 
to go for coffee, for convenience 
or preference, become part of the 
daily sacrament of java as well. 
There aren’t many strangers 
in our lives that we feel like we 
know as much as local baristas. 
My mom gave me my first cup 
of coffee when I was 12 — a 
sickly sweet, half drunk decaf 
caramel 
macchiato 
handed 
over on a Washington D.C. 
metro, and I’ll never forget that 
moment: the paper cup to my 
lips, the lukewarm temperature, 
that 
masked, 
deep 
flavor. 
I’ve graduated from caramel 
macchiatos and decaf coffees to 
develop a more mature, grown 
up palate for the flavors that can 
be garnered from stand alone 
plain black coffee.
When I’m staring at the menu 
in a coffee shop, I generally 
prefer a single espresso or an 
almond milk cappuccino. I like 
my coffee dark, strong and in 
steady supply, but not unpleasant 
and bitter. I like a cup of coffee 
that cuts to the chase, is poignant 
in flavor and aroma, and leaves 
me feeling warm and bright. 
Sometimes that means walking 

the line between too dark and 
just right, and anyone who can 
fill my mug with that happy 
medium is added to my list of 
favorites. In New Jersey, I have 
two go-to coffee shops, both with 
their own personalities, and they 
always welcome me back with 
open arms and caffeine abound. 
Both shops have a feeling akin 
to coming home, and I always 
gravitate toward them when I’m 
lucky enough to have a break 
from school.
Few 
places 
can 
compare 
to the first coffee shops that 
compelled me to fall in love with 
coffee — not just the beverage, 
but the culture behind it. The 
places where we go for coffee 
say so much about who we are 
as people. They reflect us in our 
most vulnerable form: Monday 
morning pre-coffee, Saturday 
morning post-night out coffee or 
the Tuesday afternoon cup just 
because. Within coffee shops, 
we suddenly feel comfortable 
having serious conversations, 
rekindling relationships, writing 
our deepest prose or most 
enlightening 
poetry. 
Coffee 
culture is one thing, but coffee 
shop culture is another beast 
entirely. Coffee shops need a few 
things: a distinct personality, a 
potential for shared experience 
and a comforting space. On an 
Ann Arbor coffee tour, few spots 
can even compare to the nostalgic 
emotions that fill the cups that 
have warmed my palms in New 
Jersey; however, one settles right 
alongside my beloved hometown 
coffee shops, and takes the cake 
as the best coffee in Ann Arbor.
Comet Coffee, run by Ann 
Arbor’s own java wizard Jim 
Arborio, is a small, independently 
owned coffee shop that has made 
home in Nickels Arcade, a stone’s 
throw from the diag. Arborio 
has his own coffee origin story, 
as so many of us do, dating back 
to 1992, when he was a barista 
as a senior in high school. From 
there, his passion for the bean 
grew.
“I was always involved with 
coffee, roasting at home when 
I was growing up in Saline, 
Michigan,” 
Arborio 
said, 
in 
an interview with The Daily. 

“I moved back to Ann Arbor 
in hopes of opening my own 
business in 2001, and I knew it 
was coffee.”
Comet Coffee is small but 
mighty, with few tables and a 
bit of counter space, warm with 
light green walls and a handful of 
golden suspended lights. To the 
left of the register is the espresso 
machine in all its glory, and to 
the right is a case of perfectly 
handcrafted French pastries and 
the pour-over station, where the 
baristas master the art of the 
perfect cup.
Comet Coffee was born of a 
cocktail of experience with heart 
and sentimentality.
“The shop is sort of named 
after the guy who taught me 
to make drinks on an espresso 
machine,” Arborio said. “My 
experiences in my favorite coffee 
shops tend to be places that 
gather people, shoot them far 
away some place, and bring them 
back slowly, like a comet.”
Comet 
Coffee 
certainly 
provides somewhat of the same 
experience, 
taking 
students 
and professors away from the 
stressors of their individual lives 
and providing them with a space 
to enjoy conversation.
“People find a lot of identity 
in the place they get coffee, so 
we cultivate this space so that 
it feels relevant to the people 
who constantly frequent here,” 
Arborio said in referencew to 
that special coffee shop culture.
Comet Coffee is different in 
the midst of hundreds of coffee 
shops in Ann Arbor because it are 
centered and focused on human 
connection, reserving half of 
their tables for “non-electronic” 
patrons. I’ve made good use of 
those conversation-only tables, 
constantly gravitating toward 
them with a friend of mine as 
tradition to get tea after weekly 
hot yoga. Many other customers 
have similar attachments to 
the electronic-free area of the 
intimate space, a rare find in 
this technology-obsessed 21st 
century.

With one game to go, three takeaways from the end of Michigan’s win streak

When the buzzer sounded 
at the end of the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
game 
against Michigan State on 
Sunday, the Wolverines were 
met by an unfamiliar feeling: 
defeat.
Prior to its loss to the 
Spartans, 
Michigan 
hadn’t 
lost in the month of February, 
winning seven straight games. 
Though 
the 
Wolverines 
battled 
throughout, 
a few trends 
re-emerged 
from the team’s 
struggles 
at 
the beginning 
of the Big Ten 
season.
With 
that 
in 
mind 
and just one regular season 
game remaining — against 
Wisconsin on Sunday — before 
the team prepares for the Big 
Ten Tournament and possibly 
beyond, The Daily looks at 
three 
big 
takeaways 
from 
Michigan’s 
defeat 
in 
East 
Lansing.
Amy Dilk struggled with 
Michigan State’s pressure
The freshman point guard 
played 29 minutes against the 
Spartans, nearly doubling the 
amount she played against 
Rutgers a few days earlier in 
her return from a knee injury.
The 
defensive 
aggressiveness of Michigan 
State’s guards caused Dilk 
— and the rest of the team — 
problems all afternoon. Dilk 
herself, turned the ball over 
seven times.
“We 
really 
struggled 
handling 
Michigan 
State’s 
pressure,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. 
“Right from the start of the 
game, we turned the ball over 
and they were able to get up big 

on us. Amy struggled a little 
bit as well. She hasn’t been in 
this situation in a while and 
probably not in her career 
being in a game like this.”
From 
an 
offensive 
perspective, Dilk made great 
strides prior to suffering her 
setback against Nebraska on 
Feb. 7. Between the beginning 
of Big Ten play and Nebraska, 
Dilk averaged nine points and 
just over five assists a game, 
while limiting her turnovers 
to 2.5.
In her absence, 
the 
Wolverines 
had to grind out 
wins 
against 
Penn State and 
Indiana. 
Dilk’s 
replacements 
at point guard, 
whether it was 
sophomore 
Deja 
Church, 
senior 
Nicole 
Munger 
or 
even 
junior 
Akienreh 
Johnson, 
didn’t 
look completely comfortable 
as the primary ball-handler 
and Michigan’s offense looked 
discombobulated at times.
On Sunday, it was Dilk who 
wasn’t completely comfortable 
at the helm. She looked a little 
rusty and a step slower than 
her normal game speed. The 
Spartans 
took 
advantage.
But with a full 
week before the 
Badgers 
come 
to town, Dilk 
should 
have 
time to continue 
her 
recovery 
and return to 
form.
One 
of 
the 
most 
talented 
players on the floor, even as 
a freshman, her play will be 
critical to the Wolverines’ 
success on Sunday and in the 
postseason.
“Going into the postseason, 
it’s just important that she has 

her confidence back and feels 
ready so we have our flow back 
again,” said freshman forward 
Naz Hillmon after the win 
against Rutgers.
The 
Spartans 
dominated the 
boards
If 
turnovers 
were 
at 
the 
top of Barnes 
Arico’s list of 
grievances after 
the 
Michigan 
State 
game, 
Michigan’s 
rebounding 
struggles 
followed 
closely 
behind. 
The 
Spartans 
controlled 
the 
glass 
all 
afternoon but their dominance 
was particularly evident in 
the second half while the 
Wolverines were mounting a 

comeback.
In 
the 
third 
quarter, 
Michigan State extended its 
lead from four to 11 points on 
the back of seven offensive 
rebounds. 
Excluding 
Hillmon, 
who 
finished 
with 
a 
game-high 
11 
rebounds, 
Michigan’s 
bigs 
— senior center 
Hallie 
Thome, 
sophomore 
forward 
Hailey 
Brown and junior 
forward 
Kayla 
Robbins — combined for seven.
Rebounding 
is 
one 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
greatest 
strengths, as they are top-
20 nationally in rebounding 
margin. With that in mind, 
one off-game against a team 

with Michigan State’s size is 
understandable, but if their 
rebounding struggles persist, 
it could cost them come the 
postseason.
Michigan 
can still finish 
fourth in the 
Big Ten
In terms of 
the 
Big 
Ten, 
Michigan’s 
recent surge up 
the 
standings 
gave it some 
wiggle 
room 
heading 
into 
Sunday.
With 
a 
win 
against 
Wisconsin, 
the 
Wolverines 
would finish fourth in the 
conference, 
giving 
them 
a 
double-bye in the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
Tentatively 
situated 
in 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament field as an 8-seed 
according to ESPN’s Charlie 
Creme, an automatic entry 
into the third round of the Big 
Ten Tournament would leave 
Michigan one win away from 
the semifinals, likely ensuring 
them a bid to the Big Dance.
First though, the Wolverines 
must learn from their mistakes 
ahead of their regular-season 
finale. With the benefit of 
their first full week of practice 
in six weeks, they will have 
that opportunity.
“We’re 
really 
struggling 
right now with handling some 
pressure as well as blocking 
out and not giving up offensive 
rebounds,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We’ll have a couple days to 
work on that before we have to 
start preparing for Wisconsin, 
but it’s nice to have a chance to 
work on Michigan.”

Wolverines fall to Tar Heels, 5-2

The Michigan women’s tennis 
team and No. 2 North Carolina 
captivated an audience on Sunday 
at the Varsity Tennis Center with 
a rollercoaster match flooded 
with 
tiebreakers, 
momentum 
swings 
and 
everything 
in 
between. The Tar Heels defeated 
the Wolverines, 5-2, resulting in 
Michigan’s second loss of winter 
play.
Tar Heel Cameron Morra 
vaulted to a commanding 5-3 
lead in the No. 4 singles match 
against junior Chiara Lommer. 
With her back against the wall, 
Lommer mounted an imposing 
comeback, tying the set at six 
off a cross-court winner. But the 
comeback fell short as Morra 
grinded out the final rally to 
take the tiebreaker, 7-3. Lommer 
was unable to overcome her first 
set defeat, yet maintained her 
relentless drive in a 6-1 losing 
effort in the second set, even 
after the Tar Heels clinched the 
match.
“We were pretty even and 
every 
single 
game 
was 
(decided by) one 
point here and 
there,” Lommer 
said. “This was 
a 
really 
big 
opportunity 
playing 
UNC, 
and I wanted to 
stay out there for 
everyone.”
Junior Giulia 
Pairone had a similarly turbulent 
No. 2 singles match against 
North 
Carolina’s 
Makenna 
Jones. Decisive groundstrokes 
earned Pairone an early 4-1 lead 
before Jones rattled off three 
straight games. Jones completed 
her comeback in a back-and-forth 
set, coming away with a 7-6, 8-6 
tiebreaker victory. Pairone was 
unable to stall Jones’ positive 
momentum, falling 6-1 in the 
second set after an emphatic 
serve from Jones, the clinching 
point for UNC.
“Those girls especially do such 
a good job competing, and losing 
like that, it’s kind of deflating,” 

said Michigan assistant head 
coach Teryn Ashley-Fitch. “But 
you’ve got to figure out a way to 
keep going and keep the pressure 
on North Carolina.”
Senior Brienne Minor started 
off her No. 3 singles match 
against Tar Heel Alexa Graham, 
taking a 2-1 lead off a flawless 
winner down the line. But 
Minor’s lead was short-lived. 
Graham took the next three 
games, en route to a 6-4 first-set 
victory. Minor remained unfazed 
in the highly-contested second 
set, but it wasn’t enough, as 
Graham took the 
set 7-6, winning 
the 
tiebreaker, 
7-3.
Sophomore 
Bella Lorenzini 
struggled 
against 
North 
Carolina’s Jessie 
Aney in their No. 
6 singles match. 
Lorenzini’s 
net 
play 
was 
incapacitated by Aney’s perfectly 
executed passing shot, leading to 
a 6-0 Tar Heels first-set victory. 
Lorenzini’s adjustments came 
too late, falling 6-3 in the second 
set.
At No. 5 singles, sophomore 
Alyvia Jones initially struggled 
against Allie Sanford’s serve, 
falling 
behind 
1-2. 
Jones 
responded by taking a crucial 3-2 
break and never looked back on 
her way to a 6-3 first-set victory. 
Jones built on her momentum, 
jumping out to a 5-2 lead before 
forcing an error off a powerful 
forehand to take the second set, 
6-3.

Senior Kate Fahey built on 
her illustrious career in her 
No. 1 singles victory over North 
Carolina’s Sara Daavettila. Fahey 
quickly had Daavettila running 
all over the court with perfectly-
placed groundstrokes, earning 
an early 3-0 lead en route to a 
6-1 victory. Fahey responded 
to 
Daavettila’s 
second-set 
adjustments, winning a pivotal, 
endless rally to take a 3-2 break 
before walking away with a 6-2 
second set victory.
The 
Wolverines 
struggled 
against 
the 
Tar 
Heels’ 
fundamentally sound doubles 
play. Minor and Alyvia Jones 
lost their first four points at No. 
2 doubles against Graham and 
Aney, setting up a 6-1 North 
Carolina victory.
Michigan’s No. 3 doubles 
Lommer and Lorenzini had their 
chances against Sanford and 
Daavettila, but were plagued by 
no-advantage scoring, losing two 
consecutive games at 40-40 and 
eventually fell, 6-3.
Fahey and Pairone were the 
lone victorious doubles team 
among the Wolverines. After 
building a 3-1 lead, the No. 1 
doubles team found itself down, 
0-40. Fahey and Pairone showed 
their sense of urgency, climbing 
all the way back to take the 
4-1 break. The comeback was 
capped by a volley winner from 
Fahey after a seemingly eternal 
rally. Michigan led 5-2 before the 
match was abandoned.
“They really feed off each 
other’s 
energy,” 
Ashley-Fitch 
said. “Kate is really consistent 
and Julia has that fiery energy 
and ability to attack at net.”

Heidt, defense shine in ‘M’ victory

 Down one goal with 11.8 
seconds 
left 
in 
the 
game, 
Jacksonville 
midfielder 
Evan 
Tyler dodged ferociously off the 
wing and dished the ball off to 
midfielder Jack Dolan, setting 
up what seemed to be the perfect 
opportunity for a game-tying 
goal for the Dolphins.
But 
fifth-year 
senior 
goalkeeper Tommy Heidt stood 
his ground, warding off Dolan’s 
shot as time expired, icing the 
game for the Michigan men’s 
lacrosse team, 11-10.
“I was in the right spot, so it 
hit me,” Heidt said.
With 15 saves on the day, Heidt 
stood tall between the pipes 
—aided by a strong, punishing 
defensive unit — to lead the 
Wolverines (2-1) to a narrow 
victory over Jacksonville (0-4) 
on Saturday.
“Most of the shots I saw were 
the shots I wanted to see … That’s 
credit to our defense,” Heidt said. 
“(They) played incredible.”
Following 
a 
heartbreaking 
17-16 loss in double overtime to 
the Drexel Dragons on Tuesday, 
Michigan was eager to bounce 
back against the Dolphins on the 
road.
“I had a tough game last 
(Tuesday) against Drexel,” Heidt 
said. “We went back down to 
the fundamentals … I did a lot 
of mental preparation to get this 
one back … (I think) we fixed a lot 
of the kinks.”
Added Michigan coach Kevin 
Conry: “Tommy Heidt stood on 
his head. He was terrific and it 
was a great bounce-back game 
for him.”
Like Heidt, the Wolverines 
straightened out and dominated 
the gritty aspects of the game. 
Sophomore face-off man Connor 
Cronin frequently won the clamp 
against 
his 
opponent, 
going 
12-for-20 on faceoffs, to aid an 
offense that had struggled to 
gain possessions off faceoffs in 
its past few games. Michigan 
also dominated ground ball play, 
scooping up 27 of 50 ground 
balls, with Heidt contributing 
seven ground balls and senior 

defenseman Nick DeCaprio also 
picking up three on the day.
“When we had (faceoffs and 
ground balls) rolling, that just 
means extra possessions for us,” 
Conry said.
For the Wolverines, those 
extra possessions led to even 
more goals, including seven 
different goalscorers by the day’s 
end.
With five minutes remaining 
in the first quarter, freshman 
attackman Bryce Clay fired a 
shot in tight past Jacksonville 
goalkeeper Hunter Sells to tie 
the game up 1-1. The Wolverines 
then went on to score three more 
unanswered 
goals, 
including 
a pair of goals from junior 
attackman Jason Brown and 
one from senior midfielder Brent 
Noseworthy.
At the half, Michigan led 
the Dolphins, 5-3. As DeCaprio 
sprinted down the field and 
rocketed a top-shelf goal past 
Sells in the final minutes of the 
first half, the Wolverines’ bench 
was electrified.
The defense featured strong 
individual performances, like 
that 
of 
senior 
defenseman 
Brandon Shima, who mustered 
two ground balls and led the team 
with four caused turnovers on 
the day. Freshman defenseman 
Andrew 
Darby 
caused 
two 
turnovers in his first game as a 
starter.
Nevertheless, like its past two 
games, the Michigan defense 
allowed its opponent to get back 
into the game.
However, persistent struggles 
on situational defense allowed 
Jacksonville to crawl back and 

tie up the game at six, with nine 
minutes into the third quarter.
“We have been trying to 
recreate some of these scramble 
situations in practice,” Conry 
said. 
“What 
we 
are 
really 
focusing on is just our situational 
awareness… when we need to 
push the ball, when we need to 
swallow it a little bit.”
Throughout the rest of the 
second half, the Wolverines’ lead 
never extended to more than 
two goals again, as both sides 
exchanged a series of goals to 
bring the score to 10-10 with 
five minutes remaining in the 
contest.
With 
fewer 
than 
three 
minutes remaining, Clay fed 
Noseworthy from the wing, 
who then launched what would 
become the game-winning goal 
past Sells to give Michigan an 
11-10 lead and himself back-to-
back hat tricks
As time wound down, Heidt 
and the Wolverines’ defense 
came up clutch, stifling the 
Dolphins’ 
offense 
when 
it 
mattered most.
“(We) didn’t give up in those 
last 11 seconds and worked really, 
really hard,” Heidt said. “(We 
gave) everything (we had) while 
trying to stay mentally dialed-
in.”
Despite 
other 
challenges, 
Michigan’s stellar goalkeeping 
and 
offensive 
consistency 
allowed it to escape with another 
narrow, yet impressive, victory.
“There’s nothing like the value 
of experience,” Conry said. “By 
going through the wringer now, 
we have learned what it means 
to win.”

Tom Izzo reverses rivalry narrative

Tom Izzo was standing at the 
podium and making a point about 
defense when the shout came.
Hey Tom! Hey Tom! Hey Tom!
A fan on the Crisler Center 
staircase — it didn’t matter what 
colors he wore — wanted Izzo’s 
attention. The Michigan State 
coach stopped talking. He leaned 
his head forward and obliged.
“Yeah, thanks.”
After Sunday, he deserved all 
the credit he got.
For the last year, the Michigan-
Michigan State rivalry has been 
defined by Izzo’s unwillingness 
to change — and John Beilein 
subsequently 
tearing 
the 
Spartans to shreds. Prior to the 
second matchup between the 
two last year, the adjustment was 
out in the open for Izzo to make: 
put Jaren Jackson Jr. at center to 
match up with Moritz Wagner, 
switch ball-screens, neutralize 
Michigan’s pick-and-pop game.
Instead, Izzo changed nothing. 
Jackson sat for key stretches of 
the second half. The Spartans 
kept 
hedging 
ball-screens. 
Beilein’s offense — predicated 
on ball-screens with Wagner — 
hummed to the tune of 75 points, 
15 of them from the German. The 
Wolverines won, easily, and the 
root cause stood on the sideline.
So, maybe it’s understandable 
that Beilein didn’t anticipate 
Izzo would switch up his defense 
ahead of Sunday’s game. After 
the fact, it’s certainly easy to 
understand why Izzo did just 
that.
Jackson 
and 
Wagner 
are 
both long gone, but on Sunday, 
Michigan 
State 
switched 
screens anyway. Beilein and the 
Wolverines were caught off-
guard, forced to play one-on-one 
basketball. The result: a 77-70 
win for the Spartans — one in 
which Michigan totaled all of 
six assists, its lowest since last 
year’s national title game against 
Villanova.
“We have certain habits that 

are not good for some one-on-
one situations,” Beilein said. 
“And we’re trying to break those 
habits, but when that’s been 
going on for 10 years, it’s hard 
to break it in the short time we 
have.”
Izzo’s 
adjustments 
worked 
and worked well. By the end of 
the game, Michigan was left with 
multiple scoreless stretches and 
no answer to the 
question of who 
should get the 
ball late.
“We 
didn’t 
make the right 
decisions 
at 
times,” 
said 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis. “I feel 
like we could’ve 
definitely 
done 
better offensively, for sure, that 
(there) was definitely matchups 
and stuff that we could’ve went 
to. I feel like we’re gonna be more 
ready next time.”
On the other sideline, Beilein 
tried playing off Michigan State’s 
Kenny Goins, daring the center 
to shoot. He hit three 3-pointers 
in the first half, all of them wide 
open.
Michigan’s defense — ranked 
third 
in 
KenPom’s 
adjusted 
efficiency — gave up its most 
points per possession all year. 
It forced just six turnovers. It 
let the Spartans get to the free 
throw line 30 times.
For a group whose identity 

rests on doing the exact opposite, 
getting picked apart by Izzo and 
guard Cassius Winston was a 
rude awakening.
Even 
when 
junior 
guard 
Zavier Simpson managed to 
get over ball-screens, Michigan 
State’s point guard manipulated 
space in a way befitting of the 
likely Big Ten Player of the Year 
winner. He scored 27 points, and 
the 
Wolverines 
could do nothing 
about most of 
them.
But when the 
topic 
of 
ball-
screen 
defense 
came 
up 
late 
in 
the 
press 
conference, 
Beilein 
was 
a 
little 
more 
revealing.
“(Winston’s) gonna get himself 
into 
a 
one-on-one 
situation 
with (Jon) Teske,” Beilein said. 
And he’s deceptive enough to 
get around him a couple times. 
A couple of times, (Simpson) 
wanted to get back but (Simpson) 
didn’t have leverage yet. So 
then he got back and there, 
(Winston’s) going into the basket.
“So, we’re a really good ball-
screen defense team. We weren’t 
good today. And credit him.”
Credit Winston if you want 
— you wouldn’t be wrong. But 
in a rivalry defined by two Hall 
of Famers on the sideline — one 
future, one current — the latter 
came out on top.

Behind the glass, Will Lockwood waits for worst

Throwing out his hands in 
disbelief, Will Lockwood simply 
couldn’t believe it.
In his eyes, his stick had 
simply lodged in between the 
Ohio State player’s legs, and he 
quickly dropped it to prevent 
any calls. Nothing intentional. 
No ill-intent.
But the whistle was blown 
anyways, and despite the junior 
forward’s pleas of it being a 
mishap, his emotions got the 
best of him when the referee 
refused to alter his call.
“What? What kind of call 
was that?” Lockwood shouted, 
according to Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson.
The 
stoppage 
came 
right 
as a double-overtime period 
began in the Michigan-Ohio 
State matchup — a game that 
ended in a 4-3 double-overtime 
Wolverine loss. Right as the 
first overtime ended, freshman 
forward Dakota Raabe drew 
a penalty on Buckeye forward 
Mason Jobst, sending him to 
the box and giving Michigan a 
full two minutes on the man-
advantage to start the sudden-
death second overtime period.
However, 
right 
as 
the 
Wolverines fought for the puck 
during a faceoff at the opening 
of the period, the penalty was 
assessed on Lockwood, and the 
reaction ensued.
“I mean, Lockwood didn’t 
say anything,” Pearson said. 
“Usually you get a misconduct if 
you say something that’s going to 
embarrass the referee or swear 
at him or something like that.”
Lockwood, 
however, 
lost 
focus and allowed his emotions 
to get the best of him. It was 
a critical juncture in a rivalry 
game. The thought of ruining 
the man advantage prompted 
an unwarranted attempt to kick 
his stick that had dropped on 
the ice. He missed, of course, but 
the referee didn’t miss the sight 
of his tantrum. An additional 
whistle was blown, ejecting him 
from the game.
And just like that, Lockwood 
found himself in a spot all too 

familiar.
The junior had spent the 
majority 
of 
his 
sophomore 
year sidelined, though due to 
a shoulder injury back then. 
Instead of missing the games 
or sitting in the bleachers, he 
stayed close to the ice. After his 
ejection Saturday, Lockwood, 
instead of going 
to 
the 
locker 
room like two 
other 
ejected 
players had done 
that day, stood 
behind the glass 
paneling leading 
to the Wolverine 
tunnel like he 
had done much 
of last year.
It 
was 
the 
same back then as it is now. 
Unable 
to 
play, 
he 
stood 
behind the glass, a gesture his 
teammates appreciated. Instead 
of being on the ice, he stood. 
And he watched. And he waited 
for the result of his absence to 
unravel. Two minutes later, with 
a Jobst goal, it did.
“I was angry at the ref, but 
more angry at myself, I have 
to control my emotions a little 
bit 
better,” 
Lockwood 
said. 
“Overall, it was kind of a selfish 
act. … It was unfortunate what 
the outcome was, but I wasn’t 

going to miss the chance to see 
what the outcome was.”
Ohio 
State 
initiated 
the 
first push down ice after the 
call. Winning the faceoff, the 
Buckeyes shot toward the net but 
the puck deflected out of play. 
Lockwood watched helplessly, 
pointing to things happening on 
the ice while a 
student manager 
comforted 
him 
to the side.
“Being 
a 
former 
player, 
you 
don’t 
feel 
good,” 
Pearson 
said. “Especially 
if 
it’s 
a 
bad 
penalty. 
When 
you’re in the box 
and get scored 
on, it’s not a good feeling. That’s 
my personal two cents on it.”
After Ohio State started its 
second 
push, 
a 
two-on-one 
breakaway, Lockwood couldn’t 
help but pound on the glass 
after sophomore defenseman 
Quinn Hughes and freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann 
stopped the odd-man rush.
And then, after a few more 
pushes up and down the ice, 
the clock began ticking. The 
Buckeyes’ penalty which kept 
the game even-strength was 
about to expire.

“I was watching the clock,” 
Lockwood said. “And I don’t 
think many guys really knew 
exactly what was happening and 
when you’re tied up in a game 
like that, it’s really tough to be 
aware of that.”
But he saw it coming. Jobst 
rushed out of the box and into 
a one-on-one with Mann after 
all 
three 
Michigan 
players 
were caught off-guard in the 
offensive zone. The Buckeyes’ 
leading scorer finished the job, 
hammering the puck into the 
net.
“It’s just kind of unfortunate 
when 
you’re 
three-on-three, 
and you don’t know whether the 
guy’s coming out in a whistle to 
come back to three-on-three or 
what the deal is,” Lockwood said. 
“So it’s kind of just an awkward 
situation, unfortunately. It’s bad 
timing for us.”
Lockwood remained in his 
spot, staring at the pile of Ohio 
State players building up on the 
ice as they rushed to celebrate 
the game-winner. Afterward, he 
apologized to the team for his 
mistake. It was on him, though 
no one seemed to press him 
about it.
“I owned up to it at the end,” 
Lockwood said, “and made sure 
everyone knew it wasn’t going to 
happen again.”

A look at the defensive mindset of ‘M’

Mishandling a grounder off a 
short hop. A bare-hander just a 
split second from being a web-gem 
play if the runner hadn’t slid in. 
The briefest of fumbles behind the 
plate blocking a pitch in the dirt.
The stat sheet lists all of these 
plays as slip-ups. A fielding error. A 
wild pitch.
But these kinds of plays are the 
exact kind of slip-ups Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich wants his team 
to make.
“We want aggressive mistakes. 
We don’t want passive mistakes,” 
Bakich said. “If we’re going to make 
a mistake, it’s going to be because 
we’re going for it, we’re taking the 
chance, trying to make the great 
play. We’re okay with that.”
As the 17th-ranked Wolverines 
continue to shake off the rust 
of their eight-month offseason, 
they’ve made a few of these 
mistakes. In the opening series 
against 
Binghamton, 
senior 
infielder Blake Nelson made five 
errors at third base over the first 
two games. Bakich then benched 
Nelson, moving fellow senior 
infielder Jimmy Kerr from first to 
third base. 
It’s early enough in the season 
that these small inconsistencies in 
Michigan’s infield defense haven’t 

cost the Wolverines any games. A 
few issues at the beginning of the 
season are expected and give the 
team motivation to work harder 
and something to work on. 
“Physical errors happen. That’s 
baseball; that’s opening weekend,” 
Bakich said. “Nobody expected us 
to come out firing on all cylinders, 
and we wanted that; we wanted 
mistakes. We challenge our players 
to make these aggressive mistakes, 
and there were 
some 
good, 
aggressive errors 
that were made.”
Since 
the 
Binghamton 
series, Michigan’s 
defense 
has 
already 
shown 
improvement. 
The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 
errors 
in their second 
series of the season at The Citadel 
last weekend. Sophomore catcher 
Joe Donovan caught a runner 
trying to steal second with an 
aggressive cross-diamond throw 
to get the out, and kept any pitches 
in the dirt well under control. Kerr 
also appeared to settle into his 
new starting role at third; he had 
no errors on the weekend series 
and made several strong plays off 
grounders. 
But the defense is coming up 

on its toughest challenges of the 
season so far. Next week, Michigan 
will play eight games in 10 days on 
a trip to California. The Wolverines 
will face their first two ranked 
opponents of the year in No. 3 
UCLA and No. 19 Oklahoma State 
in the Dodgertown Classic, which 
will be played at Dodger Stadium, 
on March 8 and 10. The Bruins 
have scored 45 runs in a season that 
is seven games old. The Cowboys 
have scored 48 in 
as many games, 
including 
one 
where they scored 
17.
It will be a 
trial-by-fire 
for 
Michigan’s 
aggressive-
mistakes strategy. 
But 
Bakich 
is 
confident in his 
mindset.
“In sports, there’s a lot of talk 
about some teams getting the 
breaks and some teams not getting 
the breaks,” Bakich said. “And you 
can make your own breaks just 
by taking more chances, by being 
the aggressor, and finding those 
opportunities wherever they are.
“That’s the mindset we want 
our players to have. We want them 
to just go for it. We want them to be 
on the attack. We want them to be 
fearless.”

Infield finding footing

So far this season, the 
Michigan softball team has 
been erratic, at best.
While it’s easy to point to an 
offense yet to find its rhythm, 
scoring a total of 52 runs in 
14 games, the defense has 
seen its fair share of uneven 
performances, 
particularly 
in the infield. No two games 
better sum up the strengths 
and pitfalls of this season’s 
infield better than the two 
losses against No. 7 Louisiana 
State (13-3) this weekend.
The Wolverines (6-8) made 
several smart plays in both 
games, giving up four total 
runs to the highly-ranked 
team over the course of the 
weekend. The second inning 
of 
Friday’s 
game, 
in 
particular, 
highlighted 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
prowess when 
freshman 
right-hander 
Alex Storako 
caught 
a 
runner trying 
to steal third.
The infield is composed 
of several veteran players 
including 
senior 
second 
baseman 
Faith 
Canfield, 
sophomore 
infielder 
Taylor Bump, junior third 
baseman Madison Uden and 
sophomore infielder Natalia 
Rodriguez, 
among 
others. 
Theoretically, 
this 
should 
work in the Wolverines’ favor.
“(Having an experienced 
infield) is a huge advantage,” 
Uden 
said 
on 
Feb. 
5. 
“Faith 
does 
a 
great 
job 
communicating, Natalia has 
a really great glove. But it’s 
really nice having Natalia 
and Faith there because you 
kind of already know how 
they play, what their range 
is, what you can expect from 
them, honestly to the nitty-
gritty of how they throw the 
ball to you is huge because 

it’s consistent and you know 
what to expect.”
This hasn’t always been 
the case, though, as there 
were also several times this 
weekend when the infield 
faltered, 
starting 
with 
a 
fielding error by Uden in 
the third inning of Friday’s 
game. The error allowed a 
runner to advance to second 
and eventually cross home, 
the deciding factor in a 1-0 
Michigan loss. 
Communication 
was 
particularly an issue in the 
bottom of the fourth inning 
during 
Sunday’s 
game 
when Storako misread a cue 
from senior catcher Katie 
Alexander. While the ball 
was caught in left field, the 
miscommunication 
could 
have been costly as Louisiana 
State had two 
runners 
on 
base.
“I 
think 
we 
can 
all 
communicate 
a 
little 
bit 
better,” 
Bump 
said on Feb. 19. 
“I don’t want 
to say there’s 
been a lot of 
hesitation 
but 
there’s 
definitely 
been 
instances 
where 
we 
can 
communicate 
a 
little 
bit 
better where someone in the 
infield can call timeout and 
bring us all together when 
we’re struggling, when our 
pitcher’s struggling.”
Stronger 
communication 
is likely to develop over time 
as the Wolverines adjust to a 
consistent lineup, something 
that has yet to materialize.
With 
the 
lineup 
still 
varying from game to game, 
Michigan will have to work 
a little harder to develop a 
strong dynamic amongst the 
infield players.
“I think our entire infield 
is working on their trust 
relationship,” 
Bump 
said 
on Feb. 19. “I think that’s 
something we’ll get toward 
by the end of the season.”

I think 
we can all 
communicate a 
little bit better.

I feel like we’re 
gonna be more

Junior forward Will Lockwood was ejected during Michigan’s double-overtime loss to Ohio State on Saturday.

I owned up to 
it in the end, 
and made sure 
everyone knew.

We want them 
to just go for it. 
... We want them 
to be fearless.
