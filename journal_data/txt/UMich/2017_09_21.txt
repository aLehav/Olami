Close to 200 University of 

Michigan students — including 
members of the Black Student 
Union and Students4Justice — 
gathered Wednesday night on the 
steps of the Michigan Union to 
protest racially charged incidents 
on campus in the past week. 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, University Police Chief 
Robert 
Neumann 
and 
other 

administrators met the group 

upstairs in the Rogel Ballroom, 
where students demanded answers 
to questions on investigations into 
racially charged incidents from this 
week, and in the past year. Schlissel 
addressed students for 20 minutes 
before allowing the others to also 
answer questions.

As President Schlissel left the 

Union meeting early, protesters 
began to march after him along 
South University Avenue. White 
students stood arm in arm along 
the intersection of South University 
Avenue and State Street as allies, 
forming a path for protesters to 
walk.

A man stepped out of car and 

approached the crowd of protesters. 

He yelled profanities, leading to a 
physical altercation.

Protesters expressed outrage 

the arrestee was not escorted 
away in handcuffs, and many were 
originally under the impression 
the man had not been arrested. 
Diane Brown, Division of Public 
Safety and Security spokeswoman, 
confirmed Wednesday evening a 
24-year-old man not affiliated with 
the University had been arrested.

This was the only arrest and 

incident of the night, Brown said. 
As of 10:30 p.m., she was unsure 
whether 
DPSS 
had 
released 

the man, or who he attacked. 
Eyewitnesses, however, claimed 
the man punched multiple students. 

Black students said he called them 
“n------” repeatedly. 

The crowd then proceeded 

down South University Avenue to 
Schlissel’s home, where protesters 
began posting signs with Black 
Lives Matter and #BBUM — the 
viral hashtag “Being Black at the 
University of Michigan” students 
used to voice their experiences 
being a student of color at the 
University in 2013.

Students said a critical mass of 

racially charged incidents pushed 
them to protest Wednesday. On 
Sept. 17, three Black student’s 
name tags were defaced with racial 
slurs in West Quad Residence 
Hall. Schlissel sent out a tweet 

denouncing the incident, but a 
number of Black students said 
Schlissel needed to take a more 
public stand.

The same day, Ann Arbor 

community members discovered 
racial slurs on a building on Liberty 
and State streets reading “Free 
Dylann Roof” and “I hate n---
---.” Earlier this year, students 
discovered anti-Latino and pro-
Trump graffiti on the Rock, a 
University landmark. In February, 
Engineering 
students 
received 

anti-Black and anti-Semitic emails 
— later discovered to be spoofed 
— from a University professor’s 
account hailing “the return of 
the KKK” and Nazis. And this 

month a year ago, racist flyers 
propagating 
white 
supremacist 

messages claiming proof for “racial 
differences in intelligence” littered 
posting walls around campus.

LSA 
freshman 
Tyler 

Washington, one of the protest 
organizers, said she did not see 
Schlissel’s tweet until a few days 
after the incident, and believes 
an email would have been more 
appropriate. She went into the 
meeting expecting action, but 
restated afterward administrators’ 
responses remained disappointing, 
and students would take matters 
into their own hands.

“I literally said the ideas, and 

The University of Michigan 

announced 
a 
$50 
million 

donation from notable alum 
Stephen Ross — the current 
largest donor to the University 
— to the Ross School of Business 
Wednesday afternoon at a State 
of School event. According to 
a University press release, the 
contribution will assist with 
student 
career 
development 

programs, recruiting qualified 
junior faculty and Business 
School campus maintenance.

The Business School’s dean, 

Scott DeRue, held the event for 
Business students, faculty and 
administration in which he 
briefly praised the donation and 
instead spoke about the future 
of the Business School for the 
majority of the speech.

“Steve Ross, his generosity 

is unparalleled,” DeRue said. 
“The majority of that (donation) 
is for students and faculty and 
investments in the educational 
experience.”

Business students, though, 

are 
worried 
accepting 
the 

donation will send a negative 
message to their fellow students 
and the country, as the U.S. 
Tax 
Court 
ruled 
against 

Ross in August for “grossly” 
overestimating the value of 
a tax-deductible gift to the 
University. 

The case between the IRS and 

Ross pertained to a Southern 
California property donated by 

Ross — a real estate mogul — 
to the University. Though the 
University sold the property 
for $2 million, and later valued 
it at $5 million, Ross and his 
business 
partners 
claimed 

a $33 million charitable tax 
deduction. The IRS took issue 
with the discrepancy in its own 
valuing of the property at $3.4 
million, almost 10 times what 
Ross filed the tax deduction as.

After 10 years in court, U.S. 

Tax 
Judge 
James 
Halpern 

sided with the IRS and imposed 
maximum civil penalties on 
Ross and his associates.

James Hines, Richard A. 

Musgrave Collegiate Professor 
of Economics in the Law School, 
said taking cases to Tax Court is 
less common, but not unheard 
of. 

“These tax disputes are very 

common,” he said. “It’s not that 
common to go to Tax Court 

because people only go to Tax 
Court if they think they’re 
right 
and 
the 
government 

thinks it’s right and most of 
the time, these cases are 
resolved through some kind 
of negotiation without going 
to Tax Court … there are a lot 
of complicated situations.”

A new Amtrak station may be 

coming to a University hospital 
near you.

The 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

released a draft environmental 
assessment report on Monday 
detailing options for the new 
Amtrak station, which has been 
mired in more than a decade 
of delays. The report names 
Fuller Park, near the University 
of Michigan Hospital, as the 
preferred location for a new train 
station and parking facilities.

Jim 
Kosteva, 
University 

director of community relations, 
predicted that if the Regional 
Transport 
Authority’s 
plan 

to 
implement 
a 
rigorous 

Southeastern 
Michigan 

commuter 
rail 
program 

succeeds, having a station so 
close to the hospital would be an 
immense benefit for the 26,000 
employees and 10,000 to 12,000 
or more patients and visitors who 
come to the hospital on a daily 
basis.

Becky Dean, a University

Tom Price, the secretary of 

Health and Human Services, is 
receiving flak this week for having 
taken five separate flights on private 
jets between Sept. 13 and Sept. 15, 
which, according to Politico, in total 
likely cost taxpayers more than 
$60,000.

Price, who is also a Michigan 

native and two-time alum of the 
University of Michigan, used the 
flights to attend community health 
centers in Pennsylvania and New 
Hampshire, as well as participate 
in a panel discussion with a CEO in 
the health care industry at a resort 
in Maine.

The flights have critics accusing 

Price of being a hypocrite, as he 
has been developing a plan for 
eliminating wasteful spending 
within his department.

According to CNN, Charmaine 

Yoest, assistant secretary of Health 
and Human Services for Public 
Affairs, said Price arranged to fly 

privately due to time constraints.

“Within an incredibly 

demanding schedule full of 13-plus-
hour days, every effort is being 
made to maximize Secretary Price’s 
ability to travel outside Washington 
to meet with the American people 
and carry out HHS’s missions,” 
she said in a statement. “The travel 
department continues to check 
every possible source for travel 
needs including commercial, but 
commercial travel is not always 
feasible.”

In addition to criticizing 

wasteful spending, Price himself 
has explicitly addressed the issue of 
government officials using private 
jets. In a 2009 interview on CNBC, 
Price condemned congressional 
Democrats for authorizing funding 
for several private jets.

“This is just another example of 

fiscal irresponsibility run amok in 
Congress right now,” Price said.

ON THE DAILY: WE’RE SOARING, FLYING

JOHN YAEGER/Daily

LSA senior Jon Rubenstein represents the Barger Leadership Institute at 
the So Cool So Just Student Org Fair on the Diag on Wednesday.

SO COO L!

(Schlissel) said, ‘All right, so 
what else do you want to do?’” 
she said. ”They literally were not 
acknowledged. How are we the 
ones that have to deal with all 
the racial tension on campus, and 
then on top of that you want me to 
do my schoolwork, and get good 
grades?”

State 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 

D-Ann 
Arbor, 
attended 
the 

protest and sit-in to expression 
firm opposition to the expressions 
of hatred and racism at the 
University and downtown Ann 
Arbor.

“First of all, as an elected 

official, it’s important that I 
understand what the concerns of 
my constituents are,” Rabhi said. 
“Second of all, I am appalled by 
the incidents of racist expression 
that have happened on campus 
and I think something needs be 
done about it.”

In his speech at the Union, 

Schlissel explained his intention 
to work together with Black 
students 
on 
prevention 
and 

education.

“I’d love to hear your ideas, and 

what you expect of us,” Schlissel 
said. “I want to learn what you 
think the administration should 
be doing beyond what we’ve 
already done to help make this a 
better place for you so that you 
can get what you want out of 
Michigan. You all belong here, 
and I want to make sure you get 
that message.”

Many, however, decried a 

lack of updates from police 
investigations 
into 
racist 

incidents. 
University 
NAACP 

chapter President Isaiah Land, an 
LSA senior, questioned the lack 
of resolutions or perpetrators’ 
identities.

“I had a meeting earlier with 

Schlissel in the (president’s) 
house, and he basically told me 
all of the things that I didn’t want 
to hear,” Land said. “I asked him 
how many people have been 
caught in these investigations 
when racial incidents pop up, 
and he told me that there were 
zero people caught in the last four 
years. They couldn’t even find the 
people who were doing this stuff 
over the internet, and we have a 
hackathon at the University every 
year? That’s just ridiculous.”

At the meeting, a student 

called for the arrest of a student 

who posted racial slurs on his 
Snapchat story, citing this as an 
example of a situation where the 
identity of could be found, yet to 
no action from the University. 
Schlissel chose not to comment 
on this suggestion.

LSA 
freshman 
Madison 

Peterson called for more than 
investigations.

“To me, investigation just 

means it is going to be swept 
under the rug, and I actually want 
punishment for these people, 
because I want to feel safe on 
campus,” she said. “I don’t want 
to be targeted in the classroom, 
outside of the classroom, at social 
events, I just want to come here 
and get an education without 
being targeted for being a Black 
girl.”

Postdoctoral 
fellow 

Austin McCoy, an adviser to 
Students4Justice 
and 
veteran 

organizer, said students’ claims 
warranted 
a 
response 
from 

administrators. 

“They asked (Schlissel), have 

you ever caught anyone, and 
(he) said no, and I think just that 
exchange shows that the students 
have facts to backup the fact 
that they don’t feel safe,” McCoy 
said. “I think that the longer it 

takes to actually hold someone 
accountable for doing these 
acts, the more tension there’s 
going to be.”

LSA freshman Nick Zazula 

said, as a white student, racism 
on campus pertained to him, 
too.

“I’m an ally, and I think that 

there is obviously a problem 
here, and that’s why people are 
coming together and any kind 
of systematic issue isn’t just a 
problem for Black people; it’s a 
problem for all of us, and I think 
that’s something we should 
address together as a student 
body,” Zazula said.

At 
Schlissel’s 
house, 

organizers told the crowd they 
must decide whether they 
want to stay on the lawn of the 
house or reassemble tomorrow. 
The majority of the crowd 
remained on the lawn, but 
leaders reinforced that health 
comes first and it was all right 
if protesters needed to leave to 
complete homework.

Feeling like an outsider didn’t 

stop there. There were also 
the many times during school 
lunches where I dumped packed 
lunches or let them run cold in 
my lunch box. I would starve or 
pull out the few “appropriate” 
snacks for lunch I would have 
that included packaged crackers 
and sliced apples. The few foods 
that wouldn’t garner judging 
looks and wrinkled noses. How 
desperately I just wanted a 
brown paper bag and a PB&J 
sandwich.

Then there were the moments 

in class where I knew I didn’t 
belong. In my music class in 
elementary schools we covered 
American singers. Our music 
teacher would always encourage 
us to go home and ask our parents 
about the singers we learned in 
class. As a diligent student, I tried 
to ask my parents, but they never 
knew what I was talking about. 
I would ask them earnestly with 
eyes begging for some sort of 
connection, anything. I would 
have taken it even if they had 
remembered a different band 
with a similar sounding name. 
Instead, my mother would tell 
me about her favorite Korean 
singers growing up.

After elementary school, there 

were no talks about my heritage. 
The diversity nights stopped. 
It was only about preparing 
ourselves for college.

In high school, I remember 

opening a textbook to try to 
read anything about Korea. As 
a textbook from a world history 
course, I safely assumed there 
would be at least one chapter 
or even a page about Korea. 
Something that for the first 
time would tell me that who I 
was mattered in my academic 
studies. I scrambled through 
the pages before opening to the 
index, heart beating faster as I 
flipped to the appropriate page 
numbers. What I found was but 
a small sliver of a paragraph 
about the shoe industry. I am not 
sure what was the sadder part. 
The fact that it was only that 
paragraph or that I was not even 
shocked or distraught, having 
been so used to the sharp barrier 
of my Korean home life and my 
time in school. During that same 
“world” history course, we spent 
two days on the ancient Chinese 
civilization (at least I had the 
same skin tone) before spending 
the entire school year on other 
history.

I remember learning about the 

civil rights movement, but I do 
not remember any conversations 
on the place of Asian Americans 
in it. I did not know or ever learn 
who Grace Lee Boggs and her 
contribution to the movement 
were. Never did I learn about 
who Vincent Chin was, brutally 
targeted 
and 
murdered 
for 

taking away supposed jobs from 
white union auto workers. No 
one celebrated Asian History 
Month (It’s in May.) All moments 
where I learned that my identity 
was not important or valued 
enough to be learned.

From 
elementary 
school 

through high school and my 
entire time in the Ann Arbor 
Public Schools system, I had 
never been taught by someone 
who was Asian. The closest I got 
to an authority figure who looked 
like me was a lunch supervisor 
named Mr. Lu in elementary 
school. Mr. Lu was a pretty chill 
guy, and I felt as if he also felt a 
bond with me being one of the 
few Asian students. In his broken 
English, he would always try 
and ask me questions. Though I

to the appalling display of hate in 
West Quadrangle Residence Hall.

What were your initial thoughts 

and reactions to seeing the name 
tag?

“Initially, I was completely 

surprised by what went down. 
No one expects to wake up to an 
attack on their identity — let alone 
finding one literally posted on their 
door. While I went through the day 
feeling fine, as the day wore on, my 
anger and anxiety began to peak. 
Eventually, this anger resulted 
in an impassioned speech to my 
learning community — Michigan 
Community 
Scholars 
Program 

— where it was met with positive 
feedback. This convinced me that 
the community cared and could 
empathize with me.”

How have you been processing 

these events?

“On top of my heavy workload 

as an engineer, I have to deal with 

this additional heavy emotional 
weight. Some people may consider 
the vandalization in West Quad to 
be a joke, but this is the experience 
we live every day. Latinx are seen to 
be a part of drugs, Arabs are seen as 
terrorist — this is not an attack on 
Black Americans, this is an attack 
on people of color and the minority 
race as a whole.”

Do you think this is an isolated 

incident?

“This issue is an ongoing issue. 

Minorities, 
not 
just 
Africans 

Americans, face this. For example, 
downtown 
Ann 
Arbor 
was 

vandalized yesterday with the 
saying “Free Dylann Roof” and 
“Fuck N------.” As an African 
American from Detroit, I have 
experienced a lot first hand, but 
direct racism is new and I shouldn’t 
have my first experience of direct 
racism be at this prestigious 
university.”

How do you feel about the way 

that the situation has been handled 
on campus?

“Although I spoke in front of 

the 200-plus members of MCSP 
and LSA Dean Martin, that is not 
enough. Despite him saying he 
will do everything in his power to 
address the issue, more must be 
done. My dialogue on this issue isn’t 
enough, other students also must 
work to build awareness on the 
issue. They must think about ways 
that they can help create a solution, 
and learn how to stand up for 

marginalized voices. That begins 
with not making assumptions 
about people of color about their 
own experiences. As a group 
that represents only 4 percent of 
the student body, we need white 
students to also speak up on our 
behalf. Only when assumptions 
are dropped and people defend one 
another can we begin the work of 
creating a more inclusive and 
diverse campus.”

-------------------------------
Michigan in Color would like 

to thank Tyrice for taking the 
time to explain his thoughts 
and response to his run-in 
with blatant racism on campus. 
Michigan in Color recognizes 
the 
tremendous 
emotional 

toll that this event took on 
Tyrice, the two other students 
affected, MCSP and the larger 
Black community on campus. 
Michigan in Color would also 
like to stress that when events 
like these happen, people of 
color are not — and should not 
— be expected to respond in 
an identical fashion as Tyrice. 
Because we all process events 
differently, it’s important to 
remember that one reaction 
to hate is no more or less valid 
than any other. As a campus 
community, all we can do is 
listen to these reactions and 
provide a space where we can 
support, empathize with and 
understand their experiences.

Ann 
Arbor 
is 
a 
bubble-

community. A bubble community 
as in perfect-looking from the 
outside and the people on the inside 
keep to themselves. Most people 
living here seem to be nuclear 
families with white-collar jobs. 
When I was younger, I assumed the 
rest of America was pretty much 
just like Ann Arbor. On family 
vacations, my family would avoid 
any “dangerous” parts of cities, as 
if to shield me from the realities of 
the world. Not every place was like 
Ann Arbor. Detroit was always the 
place to avoid. (Think: “The Lion 
King” where Mufasa tells Simba to 
not go to any place the sun does not 
touch.)

Ann Arbor is also home to the 

University of Michigan, heralded 
as a liberal bastion and where some 
of the state’s most progressive 
ideas sprout. The place where 
Democrats come to give their echo 
chamber speeches and start their 
campaigns. It doesn’t take long to 
look up Ann Arbor’s awards on the 
city’s website, where one can find 
all the accolades a city can achieve. 
No. 1 most educated, best city to live 
in America. The list goes on.

For a young, 3-year-old Korean 

boy, Ann Arbor is also the place I 
have called home for the past 18 
years of my life. Born in Jeonju, 
South Korea, I moved to Ann 
Arbor, Mich., when I was 3. My 
earliest memories include snow, 
waist deep, fall leaves and the 
maize block ‘M.’ (Yes, there are 
plenty of pictures of me as a baby 
with Michigan clothing on.) I was 
also pretty much the only Korean 

kid. The few Korean friends I had 
always moved back to Korea or 
other places across the country 
with more diversity.

You would expect having grown 

up in a place so well educated 
and known for its quality of life 
that I would have had a blessed 
childhood. On one hand, yes, I 
am enormously thankful for the 
opportunities afforded to me by 
living in this city. Perks including 
the gorgeous city parks, all the 
educational 
opportunities 
the 

University puts forth, etc. Many 
of my classmates’ parents were 
educated 
and 
many 
worked 

for the University as doctors 
and professors. It was harder if 
anything to find someone who had 
not completed a postsecondary 
education. All big pull factors for 
my parents to choose to live in Ann 
Arbor.

However, there was a flip side to 

all this perfection. In this seemingly 
utopian place that I grew up, I still 
struggled. As a Korean American 
growing up in a predominantly 
white neighborhood, I had many 
moments where I felt like an 
outsider, when I became cognizant 
of my race.

For starters, I’ve always had 

all the typical questions asked of 
me as an Asian American. Think 
of the questions such as “Where 
are you from?” As if they really 
want to know what ethnicity I am. 
Questions that signaled to me that 
there was no possible way I could 
have really been just an American. 
It was usually never OK that I just 
said Ann Arbor.

One of the first indicators was 

my name. In elementary school, I 
took piano lessons with this white 
teacher who refused to pronounce 

my name right. She always called 
me “Yoong.” No matter how 
many times my mother would 
try and correct her, she seemed 
so confident and sure that she 
knew my name better than the 
woman who had given birth to 
me and chosen that name for me. 
Moments like these did not stop 
there, whether it be the moments 
in Panera when I spell my name 
out for the cashier, and I get 
back receipts spelled “Yung.” 
It is as if the other person was 
expecting a misspelling because 
my name obviously meant I was 
from a foreign country, and my 
parents did not know English 
spelling. There were also the 
many times people would refuse 
to even attempt to use my first 
name and settle for my last name 
Lee. Literally no effort given.

In second grade, I was also 

randomly called one day to go to 
English as a Second Language. 
Unsure why I was being called 
out of my class, I followed a 
woman into a room with the 
alphabet plastered all over the 
walls. I sat there even more 
confused when I was handed 
a worksheet with the simple 
sentence “The dog ran.” This 
sentence was accompanied by a 
colorful, tacky graphic straight 
out of a book for toddlers. As 
I enunciated all my English 
words perfectly, I was deemed 
“acculturated” 
enough 
to 

resume my school year with 
the rest of my class. I wonder 
what kind of assumptions those 
people had about me based on 
my name and color of my skin. If 
they even ever cared to check or 
ask my teacher if I was proficient 
in English.


A 

little too far from Chicago 
to be considered a suburb 
and a little too left-

leaning for the stereotype of the 
typical Indiana small 
town, Chesterton is 
kind of an anomaly. 
Its 
residents 
are 

likewise 
a 
unique 

brand, predisposed to 
the tension between 
urban 
and 
rural, 

nature and industry, 
Long John Silver’s 
and 
the 
Hilton 

Garden Inn. 

As 
any 
other 

cliche-riddled 
small-town 

narrator would probably claim, 
anonymity is difficult when a trip 
to Target means seeing at least 
four classmates and the mother 
of a middle school crush. Since 
many of my acquaintanceships 
stemmed as far back as the 
second grade, I was never forced 
to reflect on my more visceral 
tendencies, to really evaluate 
myself as a friend, a student, a 
teammate, a citizen.

Like many other members of 

the Chesterton community, I’d 
been placed into a character mold 
by simply existing in the town for 
an extended period of time. The 
carving of this mold began in 
early childhood and, by the time 
I reached high school, was pretty 
much set in stone. To challenge 
it would take self-awareness, 
courage, autonomy: things I 
didn’t necessarily possess in my 
younger years.

Such a sentiment seems again 

a common thread of small-town 
narratives. 
The 
late-teenage 

burning desire to leave home, is, 
on the other hand, a nonspecific 
cultural 
phenomenon 
of 

Americans entering emerging 
adulthood. Creating an identity 
entirely separate from that of a 
hometown, friends and parents 
is as appealing as it is naive, 
disregarding the effect that these 
life factors have on the most 
natural of habits and inclinations.

My case was far from an 

exception to this phenomenon: 
I couldn’t wait to leave home, to 
break from a lifelong routine in 
such a localized space. As seems 
predictable in hindsight, the 
college transition was anything 
but smooth. The comfort of 

my 
small-town 
identity 
no 

longer 
applicable, 
my 
own 

self-perception became rather 
skewed when I moved to Ann 

Arbor.

Homesickness 
is 

nearly inevitable for 
college 
freshmen, 

with cases ranging 
from 
mild 
to 

debilitating. I can’t 
speak to the college 
transition experience 
of city-dwellers, but 
I can say that being 
the 
only 
person 

from my high school 

graduating class who’d chosen 
to attend the University was 
particularly 
intimidating. 

Encountering total anonymity 
for the first time left me more 
disoriented than driven.

First, there was the Health 

Science 
Scholars 
Program 

stationed in Couzens Hall. Yes, 
that’s correct: I had absolutely no 
idea what I wanted to do with my 
life, so I resolved to believe that 
I would “just” become a doctor. 
Following this delusional notion 
was the decision to apply to a 
STEM-based learning community 
for students seeking careers in the 
health care field. September rolled 
around and there I was — over-
earnest, slightly clueless and the 
proud possessor of a mere three 
AP credits from my high school 
English class.

It was immediately apparent 

that I was not cut out for HSSP. 
I had applied, in part, with the 
hope of finding a community 
in a dauntingly vast college 
atmosphere. 
Instead, 
I 
was 

met 
with 
unusually 
high 

levels of social and academic 
apprehension. To put it simply, I 
just don’t think that surrounding 
myself 
with 
comparatively 

advanced pre-med students was 
a particular confidence builder 
for a girl who hadn’t taken 
biology in four years, unable to 
define mitosis if she tried. 

I received less-than-satisfactory 

grades my first semester of college. 
In the classes in which I found 
myself deeply struggling, many of 
my HSSP peers pulled solid A’s. 
In an experience not unlike that 
of many other freshmen students, 
my overall confidence was on a 
downward spiral. The process of 

constructing a college identity was 
off to a rocky start, to say the least.

Without the easy accessibility 

of my hometown character mold 
that’d dubbed me a decent student 
throughout my formative years, I 
found it difficult to prove my own 
intelligence to myself. Soon after 
my arrival to college, I realized 
that I tend to derive my sense of 
self from a rather external locus 
of control, something I’d never 
before noticed.

Tendencies are in some ways 

innate. Bound to eventually 
surface, they can take on various 
forms of expression depending 
(not exclusively) on a person’s 
environment, age and social 
group. Upbringing has much 
to do with the nature of these 
habits, as it hugely determines a 
primary sense of self.

Additionally, the facets of 

my pre-college life from which 
I so badly wished to stray are 
now some of my favorite parts 
of myself. Once skeptical of my 
mother’s affinity for routine 
and 
my 
father’s 
frequent 

overworking, I’ve realized that 
both tendencies play a very real 
role in my life, no matter how 
flexible or relaxed I try to appear.

Both have their merits. A 

love for routine often brings 
structure and purpose to my life, 
while over-commitment drives 
my involvement in a variety 
of clubs, jobs and academic 
concentrations.

So thanks, Mom and Dad, for 

the second-nature inclinations.

I’ve 
allowed 
myself 
to 

romanticize my hometown a bit, 
but I do believe it has affected my 
character in more ways than I 
currently understand. I gravitate 
toward 
large 
social 
groups, 

my affinity for community, of 
that easy proximity to people 
I’d known for so long. Many 
of my friends from home have 
remained so dear to me; we 
communicate 
frequently 
and 

value the growth we see in 
one another. With maturity, 
those small-town molds have 
disappeared, and a new level of 
respect and understanding for 
separate life experiences has 
taken their place.

W

e hear it in our 
classrooms, 
friend 

groups and on social 

media: Stay woke. It’s a call to 
progressive action and beliefs. 
The term, which originates 
from 
African 
American 

Vernacular English, refers to 
the 
sociopolitical 
awareness 

to 
different 
contemporary 

and historical issues of social 
justice. The origin of the term 
can be traced back to the 2008 
song 
“Master 
Teacher” 
by 

Erykah Badu. It proliferated 
through the Black Lives Matter 
movement, becoming part of 
protest dialogue, slang and art 
following the killing of Trayvon 
Martin in 2012.

Amanda 
Hess’s 
piece 
on 

“Earning the ‘Woke Badge’” in 
The New York Times Magazine 
is an excellent text for learning 
the 
history 
of 
performing 

wokeness. 
While 
the 
term 

originally referred to awareness 
of issues on racial justice, 
staying woke has expanded 
in 
contemporary 
dialogues. 

Today, 
“staying 
woke” 
has 

been appropriated to refer to 
awareness over social justice 
issues in a broader form. Still, 
even when used by white allies 
the term is tied to Blackness. 
As Hess puts it, “‘woke’ denotes 
awareness, but it also connotes 
blackness. It suggests to white 
allies that if they walk the walk, 
they get to talk the talk.”

There are obvious criticisms 

to how the term has been 
appropriated by white allies to 
refer to a broader set of social 
justice issues. Still, accepting 
that 
this 
term 
has 
been 

appropriated, how can one tell 
if someone is walking the walk? 
How do we know if you are a true 
ally or simply posing? In other 
words, what are the different 
ways to perform wokeness?

Today, being woke or not 

extends far beyond someone’s 
private political beliefs. It is 
shown through actions and 
dialogue. For some, performing 
wokeness is worn like a badge of 
honor. For others, the opposite 
is true, as they find ways to 
capitalize on critiquing modern-
day progressive liberals. Not all 
performances of wokeness are 
the same. To understand the 
differences in how wokeness is 
performed, ask two questions: 
Where does the performance 
fall on the wokeness spectrum, 
and why perform wokeness?

The first question is quite 

simple: Where does an individual 
fall on the wokeness spectrum? 
Just how woke are they?

It is quite easy to look at 

performing 
wokeness 
as 
a 

binary — you are either woke 
or you aren’t. But doing so 
compartmentalizes the different 
degrees to which someone can 

display their progressive beliefs. 
Instead of viewing performing 
wokeness as a binary, we should 
view it as a spectrum with being 
progressive on one end and 
being traditional or antiquated 
on the other.

There are blatant extremes 

when it comes to how woke 
someone 
can 
be, 
and 
we 

shouldn’t 
just 
assume 
all 

progressive actions are the 
same. Volunteering to register 
voters in communities affected 
by voter suppression tactics 
should be seen as more woke 
than simply showing up to 
the polls to vote for far-left 
candidates. Still, each of these 
actions 
can 
be 
considered 

progressive. Viewing wokeness 
as a spectrum allows one to 
easily decipher between these 
differences and then some. 

Questioning extremism on a 

spectrum allows us to accurately 
compare 
how 
individuals 

perform unwokeness as well. 
Yelling racial and homophobic 
slurs to people on the street 
should be seen as viler than 
buying a chicken sandwich from 
a restaurant chain that funds 
anti-LGBT rights organizations. 
Still, each of these actions can 
be considered pretty unwoke.

The second question: Why 

are they woke? What are their 
motivations?

Even if two people seem to 

hold the same degree of wokeness 
— exhibiting equivalent levels of 
progressiveness in their beliefs 
and actions — it does not mean 
they are going to be doing so 
for the same reasons. Their 
performances of wokeness are 
going to differ based on the 
motivations of the individual.

For 
people 
who 
are 

progressive, 
determining 

motivation simply means asking 
why being woke matters to 
them. For the best individuals 
in the progressive community, 
the answer is simple: Being 
aware of sociopolitical issues 
is 
important. 
These 
people 

may choose to make disclosing 
pronouns a part of an icebreaker 
because they don’t want to 

misgender anyone in the room. 
They follow this norm out of 
respect to their non-cisgender 
peers who know all too well 
the 
awkwardness 
of 
being 

misgendered in a formal setting.

However, not all progressive 

individuals 
exhibit 
this 

motivation. Many may perform 
wokeness because of the social 
or 
economic 
capital 
they 

receive out of appearing to be 
woke. They may disclose their 
pronouns in a group meeting — 
not because it is the right thing 
to do, but rather for the social 
praise they gain from their 
progressive peers by following 
such norms. These are the 
people who say they are “going” 
to Black Lives Matters protests 
for the Facebook likes, and they 
kind of suck.

These individuals might also 

be identified by the way they 
react to those who aren’t aware 
of progressive norms. When 
someone in their group meeting 
doesn’t know how to disclose 
pronouns and says, “Ummm ... 
ugh, the boy ones,” they react by 
scoffing and rolling their eyes 
instead of trying to teach what a 
proper response would be based 
on their gender identity.

Don’t get me wrong, these 

individuals 
aren’t 
completely 

unethical. It’s better that they are 
mildly woke rather than not at 
all. Still, their intentions should 
be seen as morally dubious and 
they are certainly not the best 
examples 
of 
the 
progressive 

community. 
They 
perform 

wokeness only for their personal 
gain and plenty of these people 
exist on university campuses.

What about the other side of 

the woke spectrum? For people 
who are not woke, determining 
motivation centers around an 
individual’s access to social 
justice 
dialogues. 
Looking 

at such factors allows one to 
distinguish between those who 
don’t understand the language 
and norms of progressiveness 
and the douchebags.

The former doesn’t act woke, 

but it may not be completely their 
fault. Perhaps they are elderly 
immigrants 
from 
another 

country who are inexperienced 
with American social justice 
norms. They aren’t completely 
absolved 
of 
their 
anti-

progressiveness. After all, they 
are still on the unwoke side of 
the spectrum. However, their 
beliefs and actions are a bit 
more understandable.

The douchebag’s politics are 

less forgivable. They have the 
ability to understand how to be 
woke, but choose not to be. 

Reclaiming hometown habits

Y

ou’re huddled around a 
table grabbing lunch with 
friends you haven’t seen in 

a week, and it seems as if there’s an 
impossible amount of 
conversation to catch 
up on. It’s been a tough 
week; you want your 
friends’ support. Just 
as you start to speak, 
a 
friend 
interrupts, 

telling 
everyone 
to 

check out their latest 
photo on Instagram. 
And just like that, the 
conversation is dead 
as everyone whips out 
their phones.

The 
above 
scenario 
seems 

natural, just another example of 
millennial 
self-absorption. 
The 

supposed 
millennial 
tendency 

toward 
anti-social 
narcissism 

has been so well-documented — 
by everyone from baby boomer 
columnists to celebrities — that 
American 
culture 
takes 
the 

stereotype for granted. Yet the 
myth of the apathetic, narcissistic 
millennial is just that: a myth.

When 
baby 
boomers 
and 

Gen Xers depict millennials 
as lazy narcissists, they are 
following a timeless tradition of 
criticizing the supposed moral 
and intellectual decline of the 
next generation. The ancient 
Greek 
philosopher 
Socrates 

worried the rise of writing would 
spoil the younger generation’s 
minds by eliminating the need 
for memorization. Even the baby 
boomers were once the targets 
of the very same criticisms they 
level against the millennials. One 
needs to only glance at newspaper 
articles and magazine covers 
of the ’60s and ’70s to see that 
the elders of the time regarded 
boomers as lazy, self-indulgent 
and politically apathetic. New 
York Magazine epitomized this 
trend when it declared the 1970s 
the “Me Decade” in response 
to “a new religious wave” of 
narcissistic 
self-improvement. 

Claims of millennials’ narcissism 

and apathy simply don’t hold 
up in light of humanity’s youth-
bashing history.

Headlines have made much 

commotion 
about 

studies 
from 
the 

National 
Institute 

of Health and San 
Diego State University 
about rising levels of 
narcissism among the 
millennial 
generation. 

However, these studies 
fall flat due to flawed 
methodology and ample 
counter-evidence. 
As 

psychology 
professor 

Jeffrey 
Arnett 
described 
in 

The Atlantic, the Narcissistic 
Personality 
Inventory 
asks 

simplistic questions such as “am I 
assertive?” which fail to accurately 
gauge the presence of narcissism. 
Other studies have shown that 
today’s youth behaves in much 
the same way as older generations 
did in their adolescence, and self-
obsession is more related to the 
state of youth itself rather than 
generational differences. In other 
words, millennials aren’t uniquely 
self-centered. They’re just young.

In 
addition, 
millennials’ 

unprecedented 
acceptance 
of 

diverse and marginalized social 
groups runs contrary to the 
narrative 
of 
self-absorption. 

A comprehensive Pew survey 
indicating increasing acceptance 
of 
interracial 
marriage 
and 

affirmative action suggest rising 
racial tolerance among young 
Americans. In addition, a vast 
majority of young people support 
same-sex marriage and reject 
xenophobia. Millennial politics 
paint a picture of empathy and 
community, not self-absorption. 
In greater numbers than any 
previous generation, they reject 
the ultimate forms of collective 
narcissism 
known 
as 
white 

supremacy and the patriarchy.

Narratives of millennial laziness 

also seem to run contrary to 
evidence. A video of author Simon 
Sinek diagnosing the millennial 

plague of laziness recently went 
viral, reaching almost 7.5 million 
views on YouTube. Sinek claims 
a combination of participation 
trophies, 
helicopter 
parenting 

and social media have created a 
generation of unfocused slackers.

Yet again, the evidence paints 

a completely different picture. 
A recent survey by Project: 
Time Off found millennials 
far less likely to use vacation 
time and more likely to show 
dedication to their job than baby 
boomers or Gen Xers. Out of 
all U.S. workers who could be 
considered “martyrs” for their 
job, 43 percent are millennials. 
Furthermore, a survey detailed 
in 
the 
Harvard 
Business 

Review shows millennials value 
meaningful, 
socially 
useful 

work just as much as every other 
generation. The evidence proves 
millennials are not lazy. In fact, 
coming of age in the second-
largest economic crisis in U.S. 
history and its ensuing job 
insecurity seems to have forged a 
generation of young workaholics.

Finally, reports of political 

apathy 
among 
millennials 

prove to be misleading. A Pew 
poll from early 2016 found 
millennials to be the least likely 
generation to vote. At face 
value, this report seems to be 
damning. However, a separate 
Pew report found millennials 
volunteer for nonprofits and 
advocacy groups at a higher rate 
than other generations. Perhaps 
living through a recession, two 
failed wars and extreme partisan 
divides have embittered the 
generation against institutional 
political authority and pushed 
millennials to take action into 
their own hands.

It’s also possible low voter 

turnout corresponds to age 
rather

RCA

Foo Fighters find a new 
creative voice on ‘Gold’

Nine studio albums into 

its tenure as a band, Foo 
Fighters don’t have anything 
to prove. On Concrete and 
Gold, though, the band puts in 
a valiant effort to 
prove something 
anyway.

The 
initial 

track, “T-Shirt,” 
opens 
with 
a 

gentle 
sequence 

of 
acoustically 

backed poetry that quickly 
segues 
into 
an 
explosive, 

ethereal choral arrangement. 
The song rips through a few 
snappy 
guitar 
riffs 
before 

reverting back to a feeling of 
calm at the end. All within the 
span of less than a minute and 
a half.

The variety here sets the 

tone for the rest of the album: 
it 
careens 
between 
calm 

acoustics 
and 
raging 
rock, 

often within a single song. 
Everything seems to have a 
place to fit. There are insistent 
concert-rock performances like 
“La Dee Da” and the endlessly 
fun “Make It Right,” but also 
softer moments like “Happy 
Ever After (Zero Hour).” Yet 
even the harder songs have 
their quiet moments, and even 
the calmer songs still have that 
trademark Foo Fighters edge.

The variety here is appealing, 

but it may take an extra listen 
or two to fully understand 
the draw. The switches at 
times can feel a little jarring 
— particularly on the front 
half of the album, which is 

more heated than the second 
half. “Run” is a good example 
of this; it’s full of galloping 
drums and guitar parts and 
screaming vocals, all of which 
are a big part of what makes 
the Foo Fighters so much fun, 
but it also goes through a lot 
of sudden shifts in both tempo 

and mood.

The 
album 

reaches 
a 

definite 
peak 

in “The Sky is a 
Neighborhood,” 
released 
in 

August 
as 

the 
album’s 
second 
single. 

Enthrallingly 
creative, 
the 

song 
maps 
a 
fantastical 

journey through a nightmarish 
imagination full of worry and 
angst. The beat of the chorus 
alone is catchy enough, and 
combined with the high-stakes 
drive of the melody and the 
inviting phrase “the sky is a 
neighborhood” itself, it’s an all-
around complete and exciting 
single. It also showcases Dave 
Grohl’s 
indomitable 
energy 

and spirit, a common thread 
throughout the album due as 
much to his powerful vocals as 
to his skill as a songwriter.

Concrete and Gold is notable 

because almost every song 
brings something somewhat 
new to the table. “Dirty Water” 
is haunted and foreboding, 
with lyrics like “You’re my 
sea of poison flowers” and 
a seething atmosphere that 
evokes 
seventies 
rock. 
On 

the other hand, “Happy Ever 
After 
(Zero 
Hour)” 
is 
all 

dreamy acoustics, embodying 
a softer, disillusioned side of 
the album that is only seen 
in brief snatches in some 
of the other songs. These 
varying 
temperaments 
are 

brought together skillfully by 
producer Greg Kurstin. Prior 
to this album, Kurstin worked 
primarily 
with 
pop 
music, 

but his work on Concrete 
and Gold paid off, bringing 
defined character and a sense 
of purposefulness.

What’s 
more, 
Kurstin 

isn’t the only distinguished 

presence brought in for the 
album. Foo Fighters pulled 
out all the stops where famous 
appearances were concerned, 
featuring Justin Timberlake 
on backup vocals for “Make 
It Right” and Paul McCartney 
on drums for “Sunday Rain.” 
Of course, if you’re going to 
bring in Paul McCartney for 
anything, it has to feel earned, 
and this does — the entire 
album is classic-rock-inspired, 
“Sunday Rain” arguably more 
so than any other song. By the 
time it comes up, McCartney’s 
appearance feels both fitting 
and deserved.

On first listen, Concrete and 

Gold does suffer a bit from its 
frequent shifts between highs 
and lows. It accomplishes these 

feelings most masterfully in 
“The Sky is a Neighborhood” and 
“Happy Ever After (Zero Hour),” 
respectively, and the sounds that 
are packed in around these form 
an overall riotous and intelligent 
album. More than anything 
else, this is an album made with 
the clear effort to do something 
new and interesting, from the 
appearances of McCartney and 
Timberlake to the decision to try 
out a collaboration with Kurstin. 
It’s proof that not only do Grohl 
and the band have the energy to 
carry an album; they also have 
the genuine drive to keep things 
interesting and spirit to make 
that album good.

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Strong Island’ a striking 
narrative of loss, sorrow

“Strong Island” is like a 

poetic tribute to the director 
Yance Ford’s (“The Ballad 
of 
Esequiel 
Hernández”) 

departed brother William. He 
simultaneously manages to 
share the injustices William 
faced 
— 
even 

after his death 
— as a man of 
color in the legal 
system, 
while 

also 
capturing 

the 
emotional 

turmoil he and 
his family faced as a result 
of the murder of their dear 
brother.

What started as an innocent 

fender-bender 
quickly 

escalates 
to 
the 
eventual 

murder of William Ford Jr., 
the mistreatment of his trial 
by an entirely white jury and 

a murderer walking free. Ford 
navigates his family’s past 
from growing up in the Jim 
Crow south to moving to the 
segregated black suburbs of 
Long Island with dignity and 
diligence. Ford’s narration is 
soothing, almost jazz-like, as 
he adds anecdotes about his 
childhood 
while 
skillfully 

placing 
photographs 
from 

family photo albums before 

the camera. The old polaroids 
and sepia-tinted photos add 
a level of intimacy to the 
true 
crime 
documentary. 

While the film does address 
issues in the legal system 
facing people of color and 
the 
horrifying 
results 
of 

William’s case, the film also 
documents a family — one 
forever changed by a bullet.

Ford coming to terms with 

his own grief 
serves as the 
crux of the film. 
He 
struggles 

throughout the 
documentary 
searching 
desperately for 

answers that are not there 
and hoping for one last chance 
to tell his brother to turn 
around. At the film’s start 
the b-roll that fills the screen 
is all blue skies and children 
playing, but as the film turns 
dark with the murder of 
William, the b-roll begins 
to wither into deep grays 
and dying branches. It’s an 
obvious yet skillful choice on 
Ford’s part, creating a deep 
sense of contrast between 
a world with William and a 
world without him.

Barbara Ford, the mother 

of the director and William, 
is 
interviewed 
exclusively 

in the kitchen. The setting, 
like the tea kettle on the 
stove behind her and the 
towel hanging from the oven 
handle, creates a sense of 
home in a film dense with dark 
topics. Ford acts as narrator, 
investigator, 
brother 
and 

director. He speaks to the 
camera as if it is a friend and 
he is desperately seeking 
advice. In addition to the 
director’s personal accounts, 
the 
film 
also 
includes 

interviews 
with 
William’s 

friends 
and 
a 
scattering 

of his own personal diary 
entries and poems. While 
the film accomplishes many 
impressive feats of balancing 
the 
narrative 
with 
the 

factual, the balance nearly 
becomes both awkward and 

confusing.

Overall, the film is well-

executed and timely. Even 
though William Ford Jr. was 
murdered 25 long years ago, 
his story is still remarkably 
relevant today. A young black 
man is killed in cold blood 
and 
the 
murderer 
walks 

free, a story far too familiar 
and far too frequent. Ford’s 
documentary 
is 
personal 

and political, current and 

nostalgic, conversational and 
visual. As a documentary, 
it serves its purpose, and 
it makes a statement about 
grieving 
families 
coping 

with a loss that remains 
unacknowledged.

xwordeditor@aol.com

Even the most die-hard of 

“Twin Peaks” fans could never 
have imagined that a “Twin 
Peaks” 
revival 
would 
look 

anything like this. The new 
season of the beloved series 
at 
times 
barely 
resembled 

the show that many love and 
remember from the early 90s. 
While every other modern 
revival 
of 
an 
old 
classic 

(“Ghostbusters,” “Star Wars,” 
“Rocky,” “Fuller House,” etc.) 
seems to treat the original 
like the holy gospel, “Twin 
Peaks: The Return” flies in the 
face of everything that people 
thought they loved about the 
original series. Dale Cooper? 
He’s barely in this — at least 
not in the way you remember 
him. Audrey Horne? Time has 
not been kind to her. Nor has 
it been to basically anyone 
else. If there’s one thing “The 
Return” is commenting on, it’s 
the very nature of TV returns, 
and how things can never truly 
return to exactly the way you 
remember them.

While everyone else in the 

entertainment world has been 
trying desperately to recreate 
the glory days, David Lynch 
has used the “Twin Peaks” 
name to con Showtime into 
giving him 18 hours to make 
what is quite possibly the 
strangest program to ever air 
on primetime TV. It is, in every 
sense of the word, esoteric. It 
barely follows its own internal 
rules, much less the rules that 
we usually expect to govern 
narratives involving characters 
and actions. At times hilarious 
and at times demented, it 
is, more than anything else, 
unexpected. For that, we must 
be eternally grateful.

In the age of the never-

ending story, Lynch is at long 
last bringing about an end to a 
story that he never got to end on 
his own terms. It’s well-known 
that Lynch and Mark Frost 
were forced to reveal Laura 
Palmer’s killer earlier than 
they intended to and that they 
were advised to create as much 

of a cliffhanger as possible at 
the end of the second season 
to incentivize the network to 
renew the show. That didn’t 
work. 
“Twin 
Peaks” 
was 

cancelled and since then has 
remained one of the biggest 
unresolved 
cliffhangers 
in 

television history. The prequel 
film follow-up, “Twin Peaks: 
Fire Walk With Me,” only added 
more questions. So, rather 
than being a cash-grab revival 
designed to stir up feelings of 
nostalgia for the original and 
nothing more, “Twin Peaks: 
The Return” is one of the few 

revivals of the past few years 
that has felt necessary. It 
seems clear that “The Return” 
isn’t just a retread of old ideas, 
but 
an 
actual 
conclusion 

that is forcing audiences to 
re-evaluate everything they 
thought 
they 
knew 
about 

the “Twin Peaks” world. Of 
course, this season also ended 
in an infuriating cliffhanger, 
but before that happened, the 
main Bob/Cooper plotline was 
wrapped up and many of the 
characters were given a sense 
of closure. Your mileage on 
the final episode may vary but 
“Twin Peaks” was never going 
to end on a note of definite 
closure. This is still David 
Lynch, after all.

We need more revivals like 

this one. We need more artists 
who are willing to use brand 
recognition not just to make 
money, but also to promote new 
and exciting ideas and stories. 
“Twin Peaks: The Return” 
is nothing like the original 
“Twin Peaks” series, and it is 
all the better for it. There’s no 
point in bringing something 

back only to do the exact same 
thing. If more creators follow 
in Lynch’s footsteps, we could 
see the beginnings of an entire 
era of avant-garde renditions of 
classic IP hitting the airwaves. 
Sadly, 
“The 
Return” 
has 

received only average ratings 
for Showtime, and although 
it’s unclear whether or not 
the show can be considered 
a success, when you factor 
in online subscriptions, it’s 
certainly not the runaway hit 
that the original series was by 
any means. What this means 
for future projects like this is 
hard to say, but it’s certainly 
possible that other networks 
and companies will take the 
wrong lessons from the “Twin 
Peaks” revival: that giving 
millions of dollars to auteur 
filmmakers is a mistake, no 
matter what the brand is they 
are attempting to retool.

In any case, what Lynch 

has done with “Twin Peaks” 
is 
something 
that 
should 

rightfully be admired. While 
“Star 
Wars,” 
“Star 
Trek,” 

“Rocky” 
and 
many 
other 

franchises 
resort 
to 
what 

has come to be known as the 
“soft 
reboot” 
(essentially 

a way to remake an old 
film while still keeping the 
original 
continuity), 
Lynch 

has gone out of the box to 
create something that stands 
completely on its own and is 
wholly unique compared to 
what has come before it, to 
the point that it’s debatable 
whether or not “Twin Peaks” 
and “Twin Peaks: The Return” 
can even be directly compared. 
Where other reboots leave you 
wondering if you stepped into 
a time portal, asking yourself, 
“What year is it?” with “Twin 
Peaks: The Return,” David 
Lynch 
re-affirms 
himself 

as one of the great auteur 
filmmakers 
and 
reminds 

audiences that “Twin Peaks” 
is one of the most original and 
thought-provoking 
television 

series of all time.

SINGLE REVIEW

Gone is the era of EDM dominat-
ing the American mainstream — a 
period in which seemingly any 
Swedish club DJ could simply 
catch a flight from Ibiza, size up 
his sound (from deep house to 
progressive) and instantly become 
a Hot 100 sensation. This year 
— largely thanks to streaming 
services — the most commercially 
successful tracks have come from 
rappers like Kendrick Lamar and 
Drake, or singsongy crooners 
such as Shawn Mendes and Ed 
Sheeran. Finally, the Molly-fueled 
teens of the early-2000s seem to 
have developed a desire for instru-
ments in their music, a fact that’s 
reflected in megastar Calvin Har-
ris’s recent switch from big room 
house (“Summer”) to rhythmic 
funk (“Slide”).

This doesn’t mean the market 
for catchy synths is gone entirely 
though. In fact, for anyone who’s 
recently spent a Football Saturday 
on Hill Street, it may even be dif-
ficult to believe that EDM’s clout 
is shrinking. Of course, dance 
music is still — and probably will 
forever be — the preferred sound 
of drunken college tailgaters, and 
at the forefront of these students’ 
admiration for the arts is their 
ongoing appreciation for Galantis.

Ah, yes, Galantis — the DJ-duo 
that burst on to the scene in 2015 
via the overnight success of their 
breakout single, “Runaway (U 
& I).” Despite spending the past 
eighteen-months overshadowed 
by The Chainsmokers, this 
bubblegum pop team has officially 
re-emerged with their sophomore 
offering, The Aviary. Simply put, 

the LP is a forty-minute attempt to 
reclaim their spot on the playlist 
at Skeeps, but it’s not all bad: “Tell 
Me You Love Me,” an instantly 
catchy collaboration with frequent 
EDM-vocalist Throttle, is one of 
the best dance pop songs in recent 
memory.

“Tell Me You Love Me” opens 
with deep keys and a suspenseful 
entrance by its singer. Apparently, 
Throttle has been “up all week,” 
struggling to decipher indirect 
signals from a potential romantic 
interest. This is no heartbreak 
tale though — it’s a celebration of 

all that could still be. Snapping 
fingers arrive during her lead-in 
to insinuate as much, and just in 
case this wasn’t enough, the song’s 
bridge (appropriately packed 
with ever so deep pleas such as, 
“Tell me what’s on your mind!”) 
connects at the chorus with enor-
mously hyper synths, pulsing bass, 
perfectly manipulated vocals and 
a meticulously inserted “Woo!” 

on every couple of kicks. This is 
where the real party begins!

Already evolving into The Aviary’s 
biggest hit, watch out for “Tell 
Me You Love Me,” which could 
turn into Galantis’s next runaway 
success.

FENTY

Fenty’s new ready-to-wear 
looks far from subtle

Rihanna is a Queen of 

innovation. Not by any means 
am 
I 
dissing 
old-school 

Rihanna, but in the last three 
or so years, she has moved from 
being one of music’s biggest 
pop stars to mogul status. 
She’s not a businesswoman; 

she’s 
a 
business, 
woman! 

Remember when she killed the 
Grammy 
performance 
with 

Kanye and Paul MCcartney? 
And when she dropped ANTI 
in a mess that seems oddly 
fitting in retrospect? The same 
album that won Best Urban 
Contemporary at this year’s 
Grammy Awards. Well, now 
she released a makeup line for 
people of all skin tones, and 
revealed her fourth collection 

for Puma at New York Fashion 
Week.

Whether it comes in the 

form of leaving a restaurant 
with a wine glass or covering 
Tame Impala, Rih’s always 
throwing the punches and 
Fenty’s Spring 2018 Ready-
To-Wear 
collection 
is 
no 

exception.

As to be expected, the 

majority of Fenty x Puma’s 
allure isn’t its subtleties. The 
soft pink and green of last 
Spring’s collection have been 
replaced with iridescent blues, 
greens and pinks which are 
leveled out with a heavy dose 
of orange in the gut of the 
show. In line with previous 
collections, pieces alternate 
between 
excess 
(brooding 

trench coats and sweats) and 
skimpy (body suits and, for 
the first time, swimwear). 
I’ve stated before, an entire 
outfit of Fenty is a LOOK, but 
its diversity of color and style 
offers endless options when 
assimilated 
into 
a 
proper 

wardrobe 
(read: 
statement 

pieces galore).

However, some statements 

just seem wrong here. Those 
worker boots? Abhorrent. But 

then again she could dress 
Ducky Thot, Slick Woods and 
Joan Smalls in literal garbage 
bags and I would still call it 
fierce (because it would be). 

Comparably, it’s her weakest 
collection yet but DEAR GOD 
do I need that translucent 
hoodie.

McKeon finding room in rotation

The starting job at tight end 

last year belonged to former 
Wolverine 
Jake 
Butt, 
and 

everyone knew it.

Butt was an All-American, 

the offensive captain and a fan 
favorite.

Sean McKeon, on the other 

hand, was a freshman much 
further down on the depth chart 
of the 12-man tight end group. 
The now-sophomore played in 
just four games last year, and 
when he did get on the field, it 
was just for a few snaps.

In all of 2016, McKeon made 

two catches for a total of 10 
yards.

Now, he is part of a four-man 

rotation for the No. 8 Michigan 
football team (3-0) alongside 
redshirt 
freshman 
Nick 

Eubanks, redshirt sophomore 
Zach Gentry and redshirt junior 
Tyrone Wheatley Jr.

In just three games this 

season, McKeon has already 
eclipsed his production from 
last year. So far, he has five 
catches for 38 yards, and in the 
season opener, he was targeted 
three times.

“Every 
game 
I 
get 
my 

confidence 
a 
little 
more,” 

McKeon said Tuesday. “First 
game, I was definitely a little 
nervous 
playing 
Florida 
in 

Dallas, but as the weeks go on, 
I feel a little more confident, 
understand the offense better 
and am ready to go.”

The Wolverines’ offense has 

relied on tight ends at a few 
points this season. When the 
unit struggled against Florida, 
Eubanks hauled in a 48-yard 
pass 
from 
redshirt 
junior 

quarterback Wilton Speight, and 
one of the biggest plays of the 
Cincinnati game was Gentry’s 
36-yard catch-and-run in the 
third quarter.

At times this year, Michigan’s 

offense has come out in a set that 
includes two or three tight ends 

at a time. McKeon emphasized 
how important it is that they 
continue to bring physicality 
to the run game and have sure 
hands in the passing game.

Last year’s passing game 

coordinator, Jedd Fisch, viewed 
Butt 
as 
one 

of 
the 
team’s 

most 
valuable 

weapons.

New 

passing 
game 

coordinator Pep 
Hamilton might 
not 
emphasize 

the 
position 

group as much 
as 
Fisch, 
but 

McKeon and the 
others are still 
getting plenty of reps.

“Coach Pep may be a little 

more 
relaxed 
in 
meetings. 

Coach Fisch was maybe a little 
more uptight,” McKeon said, 
laughing. 
“They’re 
definitely 

both great coaches, though. I 
really like both of them… (Fisch) 
is a serious guy.

“Not that Coach Pep’s not 

serious,” he joked again.

Transitioning from Fisch’s 

scheme to Hamilton’s wasn’t 

difficult 
for 

McKeon. 
The 

formations 
and 

play styles are 
fairly 
similar, 

and 
the 
only 

differences 
are the names 
for 
plays 
and 

terminology that 
the two coaches 
use.

McKeon 
got 

his 
first 
live-

action 
taste 
of 
Hamilton’s 

system in the 2017 Spring 
Game, and has improved “leaps 
and bounds” in the past year, 
according to fellow tight end and 
redshirt junior Ian Bunting.

“Sean’s really become more 

of a complete player,” Bunting 
said. “Over the summer, he 
was working a lot on his route 
running and his pass catching, 
and he’s come a long way in that. 
He’s a great blocker, too. All the 
guys in the room recognize that.”

McKeon’s skill set continues 

to grow, as does his confidence, 
each week. As the team moves 
into the Big Ten season this 
Saturday, he knows that he 
needs to do everything he can to 
help the offense improve.

Michigan hasn’t yet displayed 

its 
full 
offensive 
set, 
and 

McKeon is confident that his 
group’s role will increase as the 
season progresses.

After all, last year, Michigan 

could always rely on Jake Butt. 
Whether it was finding a block 
or catching a pass, Butt was 
there.

McKeon wants to do the 

same.

Sophomore tight end Sean McKeon has made a big move up the depth chart between freshman and sophomore year. 

Gary, Brown believe there could 
be more in store for ‘M’ defense

On 
Monday 
afternoon, 

Rashan 
Gary 
stood 
in 

Schembechler Hall with a sly 
grin on his face. 

The sophomore defensive 

end had just been asked how 
much of the Michigan defense 
has been “seen” 
three 
weeks 

into the season. 
He 
looked 

down 
for 
a 

split 
second, 

as if to ponder 
the 
question, 

before 
looking 

up, 
breaking 

into 
a 
smile 

and giving his 
answer.

“We haven’t 

even started opening it up 
yet,” Gary said. “That’s the 
scary and most fun part. We 
haven’t really opened up our 

defense yet. You’ll see.”

He’s certainly right — if 

this is just the beginning 
for 
the 
defense, 
opposing 

Big Ten teams may not quite 
understand what’s about to hit 
them.

Through 
three 

equally 
earth-shattering 

performances, the Wolverines 

have made the 
case that they 
could be as good 
— if not better — 
than last year’s 
historically 
good 
unit. 

Michigan ranks 
fifth nationally 
in total defense, 
fourth in yards 
allowed 
per 

possession and 
fifth in yards 

allowed per play.

Gary’s 
performance, 

though, may serve as an apt 
metaphor for just how good 

this defense could be.

In each game, he’s been 

close to registering a bone-
rattling sack — or multiple. 
Yet the stats remain just out of 
reach. And even 
then, 
modest 

production 
aside, Gary has 
been a force in 
both 
the 
run 

and pass game.

So 
— 
what 

will 
happen 

once 
Gary 

finally 
gets 

his 
hands 

on 
opposing 

quarterbacks? It’s a similar 
question 
to 
asking 
what 

Michigan’s defense could look 
like once it reaches the heights 
its players think it is capable 
of.

“First few weeks (I’ve) been 

growing every week, been 
getting better and better, but 
at the end of the day, I feel like 

there’s a lot more that I’ve still 
got to show,” Gary said. “It’s 
gonna be great once you start 
seeing it.

“I feel like last year three 

games (in) to 
this year three 
games 
(in), 

it’s completely 
different 
from 

the player I am. 
There’s always 
going 
to 
be 

something I can 
get 
better 
at. 

Y’all gonna see. 
I’m not gonna 
talk too much 

but y’all gonna see when I 
start popping off.”

Take the one major gaffe 

from Saturday’s 29-13 win over 
Air Force, for example. On 
their third pass attempt of the 
game, the Falcons busted open 
a 64-yard touchdown, thanks 
to a breakdown in Michigan’s 
coverage.

“They 
brought 
#1 
back 

inside, they brought him back 
out into motion, the corner 
should have hung onto him, 
the safety should have spun 
high, we ended up 2-on-1 over 
there and no post player,” 
said 
defensive 
coordinator 

Don Brown on Wednesday. 
“Everything else was pretty 
much squared away, but that’s 
on me. I didn’t do a good 
enough job of presenting that 
to them during the practice 
week.”

It was a mistake that, as 

Brown 
intimated, 
can 
be 

erased with the right amount 
of film study. That paints a 
bigger picture — if a defense 
that held Air Force to its 
second-lowest yardage total 
since 
2014 
can 
somehow 

improve, there’s no telling 
what ceiling it could have.

And 
that’s 
why 
Brown, 

when asked what’s left for 
the defense, gave an answer 
similar to his star pupil.

“Oh,” he said, “we got a lot 

left.”

Sophomore defensive end Rashan Gary thinks that Michigan has just scratched the surface of its potential this season.

‘M’ falls to Western Michigan, 
1-0, in second consecutive loss

The ball bounced to Noah 

Kleedtke at the top of the box, 
and the Wolverines had one 
final chance to tie the game.

The 
junior 
midfielder 

stepped up and fired off a 
shot, but he missed — badly. 
The ball sailed high and wide, 
the whistle blew and the game 
ended.

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team (4-2-2) dropped its second 
straight game on Wednesday, 
1-0, in Kalamazoo against No. 
12 
Western 
Michigan. 
The 

Wolverines went without a 
shot on goal for the second 
game in a row, putting an ugly 
exclamation mark on the loss.

“We didn’t have four regulars 

playing, so it was a little 
challenging for our group. But 
the guys who stepped in, I’m 
proud of,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “Two 1-0 losses 

isn’t devastating to our group, 
our staff, or any of our players.”

Michigan’s first chance of 

the game came early. Freshman 
forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi 

had space down the left wing 
off a nicely threaded pass. 
His shot hit the near post, 
but 
unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
that 
was 
the 

closest they came to putting 
one on goal for the entire game.

It wasn’t necessarily for a 

lack of effort, though. While 
Western Michigan mustered 
more shots, Michigan was on 
the attack for nearly 10 straight 
minutes at one point in the 
first half. The best chance from 
that stretch came from junior 
midfielder Robbie Mertz. After 
a corner kick leaked out to the 
top of the box, Mertz had the 
space he needed to get a shot 
off. He did, but the attempt 
missed wide.

The Broncos had a sustained 

attack of their own afterwards, 

with just as little success. Senior 
midfielder Brandon Bye was the 
catalyst, taking a threatening 
volley inside the box in the 34th 
minute. Michigan managed to 
block it, but that wasn’t the end 
of the attack. Senior forward 
Jay McIntosh had Western 
Michigan’s best chance of the 
half just a few minutes later — a 
header, which sailed wide, after 
an undefended Bronco cross. 

Five minutes into the second 

half, the dam broke. Junior 
midfielder Kosti Moni scored 
with a header after a Western 
Michigan throw-in. His goal 
was all the Broncos needed.

Western 
Michigan 
came 

closer to a second goal than the 
Wolverines ever did to a first. 
In the game’s 50th minute, 
the Broncos forced a save out 
of Verdi, who punched away a 
threatening cross. Five minutes 
later, Connor McNulty’s header 
flew just high off a corner kick.

It took a while longer before 

Michigan started to attack more 
aggressively. The Wolverines 
didn’t get their first shot of 
the second half until the 70th 
minute. That was from Zakyi 
as well, who found himself in 
space after the ball came free 
in Western Michigan’s box. At 
that point, a familiar refrain 
kicked in for Michigan: his shot 
went wide.

“(Western 
Michigan) 
was 

very direct, drove it over the top 
so there’s no buildup play, and 
it was hard to get a rhythm,” 
Daley said. “That made it very 
difficult for us (to attack).”

Though the Wolverines spent 

most of the remainder of the 
game attacking, they never 
forced a save out of Bronco 
fifth-year 
senior 
goalkeeper 

Drew Shepherd. In the match’s 
last 15 minutes, the Wolverines 
managed three shots.

Two 
of 
them, 
one 
by 

sophomore 
midfielder 
Jack 

Hallahan, the other by Mertz, 
were 
blocked 
by 
Broncos’ 

defenders. 
The 
third 
was 

Kleedtke’s, which felt like a Hail 
Mary in more ways than one.

Peoples-Jones ready to shoulder burden

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 

doesn’t want anyone making 
excuses for him.

Chris Partridge, Michigan’s 

special teams coach, said as much 
Wednesday afternoon.

Right now, fresh off a 79-yard 

punt return touchdown against 
Air 
Force 
and 
a 
breakout 

receiving 
performance, 
the 

freshman phenom doesn’t need 
anyone to.

A week ago, well — that’s a 

different 
story. 
Peoples-Jones 

was responsible for a fumble that 
gave Michigan fans a heart attack 
and took a seat on the sideline.

He had won a starting job. 

Then he lost it, albeit only for a 
half.

In the span of two games, 

Peoples-Jones 
has 
already 

experienced the highs and lows of 
college football. And as Partridge 
explained, given the difficulties 
that come with returning punts, 
he wouldn’t want it any other 
way.

“To me, I think that catching 

a punt outside in an open 
environment like that is the 
hardest thing to do,” Partridge 
said. “… For a freshman to have 
to do that, those game reps are 
invaluable. We can do everything 
we want in practice, but when 
all the pressure is there … and 
everybody’s releasing everybody, 
those reps are valuable.

“And he just continues to lock 

it in and get better at it. You don’t 
want that stuff to happen, but that 
happening is gonna make him 
so much better moving forward 
here.”

The touchdown against the 

Falcons is evident of how apt 
Partridge’s theory is.

But even when he’s working 

with a player who was ranked as 
the top receiver in his class, there’s 
a balance Partridge must strike 
between allowing Peoples-Jones’ 
natural talent to flourish while 
still teaching him week by week.

“I can take a lot of the blame 

on myself and the coaches too, 
to make sure we progress in 
the right way,” Partridge said. 
“You’ve got to make sure that 
these guys are comfortable, can 
be fast, and can be who they are.”

If he can’t, there’s the risk 

that a repeat of Cincinnati could 
happen. And while Peoples-Jones 
doesn’t want anyone making 
excuses for him, Partridge was 
willing to.

“For a young guy, I get it to 

an extent,” Partridge said. “He’s 
trying to catch the ball first, he’s 
trying to get to where the return 
is going, he’s trying to wonder, 
‘Should I fair catch it? Should I 
play it?’

“There (are) a lot of things 

going in his mind, and taking 
charge might take a back seat in 
that moment. I think he realized 
now that it can’t take a backseat. 
He needs to take charge out 
there.”

Partridge 
may 
have 
been 

talking 
about 
Peoples-Jones’ 

role as a punt returner, but it 

could just as easily apply to him 
at receiver given the Wolverines’ 
circumstance. They are suddenly 
without Tarik Black — the man 
who leads Michigan in receiving 
yards and receptions — and have 
a date with a suddenly resurgent 
Purdue in West Lafayette this 
weekend.

And yet, what the Wolverines 

lost in Black they may find again 
in Peoples-Jones. There is, of 
course, the obvious: At 6-foot-2 
and 199 pounds, Peoples-Jones 
compares well to Black’s 6-foot-
3, 203-pound frame, and he has 
next-level speed and athleticism 
to go with it. As a junior in 
high school he won the SPARQ 
competition at The Opening — 
a recruiting showcase for the 
nation’s top seniors.

That 
all 
goes 
without 

mentioning that in his limited 
snaps at receiver, he has still had 
a tremendous impact. His two-
reception, 52-yard outing against 
Air Force is the obvious example, 
but he has consistently shown 

an ability to get open for Wilton 
Speight — something the redshirt 
junior quarterback needs now 
more than ever.

There is no question that 

Peoples-Jones 
has 
had 
his 

spotlight in the punt return game. 
Now, that spotlight is only getting 
brighter. And it’s in his mistakes 
that Peoples-Jones may find his 
next big play.

After all, Peoples-Jones has 

already shown plenty of people: 
For him, mistakes are just fleeting 
moments.

“It can’t (linger) for big-time 

players, or for anyone,” Partridge 
said. “This game is all about 
highs and lows. If everything was 
all great, you’d always win and 
everyone would be doing it.

“It’s overcoming that kind of 

stuff, and the mistakes, that really 
make a true, true competitor, 
warrior, top athlete, who they are. 
And Donovan is that. Donovan 
is going to be an unreal football 
player for this team, this year, and 
moving on.”
