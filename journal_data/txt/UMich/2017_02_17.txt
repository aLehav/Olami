Yavilah McCoy, an African-

American Jewish activist and 
educator, spoke to a diverse 
group of about 60 students on 
Thursday evening at the Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
about 

her experiences as an activist 
and holding multiple identities, 
particularly in a changing political 
and social climate.

The event, called “Holding 

Racial 
Justice, 
Equity 
and 

Intersectionality in 2017,” was 
hosted jointly by the Black Student 
Union, University of Michigan 
Hillel and NOiR Runway Fashion.

McCoy 
is 
the 
CEO 
of 

Dimensions 
Educational 

Consulting, 
a 
company 
that 

promotes diversity education in 
institutions, and the founder of 
Ayecha, a nonprofit that advocates 
for Jews of Color in the United 
States.

McCoy invoked her diverse 

experiences 
in 
advocating 

coalition 
to 
the 
audience, 

something she said is important 
to build in the face of hate and 
racism.

“I want to dedicate this 

discussion about how we can 
hold social justice and equity 
and 
intersectionality 
across 

lines of difference,” McCoy said. 
“What I came prepared to do 
was to talk to you about the ways 
which race, religion and gender 
have intersected in my lived 
experience, and given me very 
powerful reasons to stand and 

deliver in the name of equity and 
justice.”

She described her experience 

of holding multiple identities 
as a practice of having multiple 
perspectives, 
both 
of 
which 

are situations have different 
privileges 
and 
face 
different 

oppressions. 
Communicating 

personal truths across different 
communities, McCoy explained, 
is crucial in building coalitions in 
justice advocacy.

For the organizers of the event, 

this message comes 

at a crucial time on the University 
of Michigan’s campus.

“There’s been tensions in both 

(African-American and Jewish) 
communities, 
with 
different 

students 
enacting 
violence 

in different ways against our 
communities,” said BSU member 
Jesse Love, an LSA sophomore. 
“We felt that it was important 
to build a sense of connections 
between our organizations, in a 
time where our communities are 
being attacked in very similar 

ways.”

Late 
last 
week, 
three 

anonymous emails were sent to 
engineering students with anti-
Semitic and racist messages. The 
sending of the emails spurred 
students 
to 
protestoutside 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s house to call for 
increased institutional responses 
to racially-charged incidents.

McCoy noted the first step in 

fighting for justice was to listen, 

In an effort to fund the 

restructuring of Michigan’s 
deteriorating 
roads 
and 

bridges, a new state tax on 
gasoline will place Michigan in 
the nation’s top five for highest 
gas tax rates. There have been 
mixed 
reactions, 
however, 

since the implementation of 
the tax.

The tax took effect Jan. 1 and 

increased the tax on unleaded 
gasoline from 19 cents to 26.3 
cents per gallon. Tax revenue 
will go toward an investment 
in Michigan’s transportation 
infrastructure and will add 
about $455 million a year to 
the budget, according to the 
Detroit News.

The Republican-backed plan 

is the first gas tax increase in 
20 years, and is a part of a $1.2 
billion 
package 
announced 

last November. The package 
passed narrowly, though Gov. 
Rick Snyder promised benefits 
that would go beyond repaired 
roads.

“It’s not just about asking 

for more revenue,” Snyder

Ann Arbor City Councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D–Ward 3) 
announced in a Facebook post he 
will be running for re-election in 
2017, earlier today.

Ackerman, 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan 
alum, 
became 
the 

youngest councilmember in over 
20 years when he won the 2015 
general election with 90.68 percent 
of the vote while he was still a 
student.

The 2017 election will be the last 

municipal election in an odd year, 
as a result of a successful November 
ballot proposal extending City 
Council term limits from two 
to four years. Councilmembers 
elected in 2017 will serve a three-
year term, making their next 
election year even.

As of the time of publication, no 

one else has announced candidacy 
for the Ward 3 seat.

In the press release announcing 

his re-election bid, Ackerman 
pointed to his successes as a 
councilmember in the areas of 
transportation — helping to develop 
a plan to repave several of the 
city’s major roads — and housing

About 100 students gathered 

in Annenberg Auditorium to 
listen to a series of speakers 
address the topic of campus 
sexual assault as a part of a 
policy talk at the Ford School 
of Public Policy Thursday 
night.

William Axinn, a research 

professor at the University of 
Michigan Institute for Social 
Research, 
underscored 
the 

implications of his research, 
which focuses on gathering 
and analyzing statistics on 
sexual assault.

“I think you’ll see numbers 

that demonstrate that all of 
us are bystanders,” Axinn 
said. “And as a result, it can be 
pretty stressful to look at some 
of these numbers. I’m the data 
guy, but not the happy data 
guy.”

According to Axinn, 25 

percent of American women 
report they have been forced 
into 
sexual 
intercourse. 

However, women are almost 
three times more likely to 
experience this type of assault 
on university campuses.

At the University, Axinn’s 

research tries to quantify one 
of the most pervasive problems 
regarding 
sexual 
assault: 

underreporting. Of the sexual 
assaults in the last 12 months, 
only 46 percent of survivors 
tell anyone about their assault, 
and of those, only 3.6 percent 
report to an official resource 
at the University. 

In an attempt to mitigate 

some of these problems, he 
works 
with 
the 
National 

Survey of Family Growth, 
an organization that seeks 
to 
inform 
the 
discussion 

on 
sexual 
assault 
in 
the 

United States, to increase 
participation in surveys about 
sexual violence.

By 
using 
third-party 

facilitators and a non-web 
based poll, the latest survey 
conducted by the University 
got a 67 percent response rate, 
which is considered high in

emails 
sent 
earlier 

this month. Engineering and 
computer science students were 
sent emails from a hacker posing 
as 
University 
faculty. 
The 

emails 
expressed 
anti-Black 

and anti-Semitic sentiments. 
Speakers conveyed the common 
sentiment that Schlissel did not 
respond to the threats toward 
African Americans and Jews on 
campus with enough force. 

Eugene Greenstein, former 

president 
of 
the 
Zionist 

Organization 
of 
America-

Michigan 
Region, 
said 
in 

the past, the University has 
routinely failed to condemn 
anti-Semitism 
on 
campus. 

Nearly all the speakers also 
brought 
up 
demonstrations 

put on by Palestinian student 
advocacy group Students Allied 
for Freedom and Equality as a 
part of #UMDivest, a movement 
calling on the University to

Two University of Michigan 

researchers found that a Black 
male 
youth’s 
perception 
of 

his neighborhood’s safety is 
negatively 
correlated 
with 

his risk of developing major 
depressive disorder.

Psychiatry 
research 

investigator Shervin Assari and 
Cleopatra 
Howard 
Caldwell, 

chair of the Department of 
Health Behavior and Health 
Education, 
conducted 
the 

research on 1,170 Black youths, 
ages 13 to 17. The researchers 
collected data on the subjects’ 
perceptions of safety within 
their neighborhoods in relation 
to their gender, race and risk of 
developing MDD.

According to prior research 

on the subject, MDD is less 

common but more severe in the 
Black population. Because of 
this, Assari said further research 
on the topic of the correlation 
between MDD and other societal 
factors is important. 

“Although 
MDD 
may 
be 

less common among Blacks, 
depression tends to be more 
chronic, severe, and disabling in 
Blacks,” Assari’s study said. “As a 
result, regardless of presence of 
clinical MDD, Blacks have more 
severe 
depressive 
symptoms 

than Whites.” 

Assari said they wanted see 

whether Black women were as 
suceptible.

“We 
wanted 
to 
know 

whether perception of unsafe 
neighborhood would be similarly 
bad for all groups of Blacks based 
on ethnicity and gender,” Assari 
said. “There is a literature which 
says women are more vulnerable 
to their environment. We did not 

find support for this theory.”

Instead, 
these 
researchers 

found the opposite to be true. In 
a previous study, Assari found 
stress to be a stronger risk factor 
for depression in men.

“The idea is that men are 

more vulnerable to the effect of 
environmental stress, possibly 
because they try to look tough,” 
Assari said. “So they do not seek 
help when needed.”

According to the Center for 

Disease Control, this research 
could be troubling because men 
are less likely to seek help for 
issues relating to mental health, 
and because racial minorities 
are less likely to have access to 
mental health care.

“Nearly 9% of men (8.5%) 

had daily feelings of anxiety or 
depression,” according to the 
CDC. “Less than one-half of 
them (41.0%) took medication 
for these feelings or had recently 

talked to a mental health 
professional … Compared with 
white 
Americans, 
persons 

of other races in the United 
States are less likely to have 
access to and receive needed 
mental health care.”

According to Assari, the 

steps 
involved 
in 
solving 

this issue will not solely be 
discovered through research. 
Instead, 
societal 
changes 

must take place in order for 
the mental health of these 
adolescents to be improved.

“The intervention should 

be a multi-level one,” Assari 
said. “While we should help 
the individual to better cope 
with the stress, we should help 
families to support their youth, 
and we should also design and 
implement new public policies 
that operate in a higher level. 
Less investments on majority-
Black neighborhoods means 
more depression and health 
problems among resident of 
those communities.”

neighborhood safety and depression

For Black males, perception of safety negatively correlated with mental wellness

The residents of Ann Arbor will 

finally have a Jamba Juice location 

to call their own, according to a new 

MLive report — or so a sign recently 

added to a vacant storefront 

on Washtenaw Avenue would 

suggest. Representatives from the 

Washtenaw Commons shopping 

center did not immediately respond 

to requests for comment on whether 

or not the rumors were true.

The California-based juice 

chain has grown rapidly since its 

founding in 1990, opening more 

than 800 locations in 26 states and 

nine countries, including the US. 

Many news outlets even describe 

the chain’s popularity as a “craze.”

The craze does not appear to 

be popular with Michiganders, 

though, according to the comments 

section on the MLive article.

“Jamba Juice was great 17 years 

ago when a cup of carbs the size of 

your head seemed like an excellent 

idea,” wrote the commenter 

“Michigander.” 

MLive user “chuck roast,” who 

took issue with the speculative and 

trivial nature of the article, had a 

few words for the author.

“You need to get a real job!” he 

wrote in a comment, tagging the 

author.

User “TwoBigDogs,” read the 

guidelines before commenting and 

was a bit more respectful.

“Respectfully, WHY is THIS 

a ‘story’?” TwoBigDogs wrote. “I 

KNOW of 31 NEW signs installed 

in the last WEEK alone. Where are 

THEY?”

According to a book by the 

company’s founder, the name came 

from the word “jama,” meaning, 

“to celebrate.” However, MLive 

commenter Merica2016 wrote, 

and a dictionary search confirmed, 

the company’s name has a slightly 

different meaning.

“Jamba means fart in Swahili,” 

Merica2016 wrote.

the field. 

Pamela Heatlie, the deputy 

Title IX coordinator in the 
Office 
for 
Institutional 

Equity, said much of her 
work at the OIE is aimed at 
improving the 3.6 percent 
sexual assault reporting rate, 
including updating the sexual 
misconduct policy in July to 
include expanded definitions 
and 
scope 
of 
acceptable 

conduct.

She 
emphasized 
this 

process 
was 
centered 
on 

giving 
students 
choices 

and control with how they 
proceed.

“For the most part, we 

want claimants to feel a sense 
of control in what can feel 
like a very uncontrollable 
situation,” she said.

She 
discussed 
whether 

sexual 
assault 
should 
be 

handled 
internally 
at 
all, 

as 
this 
can 
compromise 

investigations. She elaborated 
that civil rights laws, in 
particular Title IX guidance, 
require the school to provide 
services to investigate sexual 
discrimination, 
including 

sexual assault.

Holly Rider-Milkovich, the 

former director of the Sexual 

Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness Center, attempted 
to dispel what she felt was a 
fallacy in the way campuses 
dealt with sexual assault.

“Oftentimes, when I am 

talking 
about 
this 
issue 

on campus, there is a false 
dichotomy that is struck,” 
she said. “That we can either 
focus on prevention, or we 
can focus on compliance, 
and I really encourage us 
as 
a 
community 
and 
us 

nationally to stop dividing 
these two pieces, that we 
can both do excellent work 
in compliance, and excellent 
work in prevention. And I 
would argue that the best 
way to achieving compliance 
is to do our very best work in 
prevention.”

She used the University 

as an example of a school 
that has a robust system for 
dealing with sexual assault, 
and to her, the first step in 
creating this kind of system is 
a focus on long-term funding.

Rider-Milkovich discussed 

how 
the 
University’s 

program has evolved over 
the past 25 years, beginning 
with 
an 
initial 
focus 
on 

preventing 
sexual 
assault 

and 
its 
consequences. 

While this was considered a 
standard industry practice 
for the time, she detailed 
how 
the 
University 
has 

since spearheaded a more 
comprehensive approach. This 
approach emphasizes what 
healthy sexuality looks like 
and mandates participation 
in healthy sexuality events 
for all incoming students. 
With these steps, she also 
referenced 
the 
desire 
to 

increase student reporting of 
crimes, as well as the hope 
for a decrease in overall 
incidents.

Public Policy senior Emma 

Zorfass, who has volunteered 
with 
SAPAC 
throughout 

her 
entire 
college 
career, 

underscored the need for 
more education.

“We want to start talking 

more explicitly about the 
connection between sexual 
violence 
and 
other 
forms 

of violence,” Zorfass said. 
“Sexism, racism, xenophobia, 
etc., they all happen in the 
same 
space 
and 
they’re 

interconnected, so it makes 
sense to talk about them all 
together.”

This focus has increased 

outreach 
between 
student 

organizations and facilitated 
dialogue about increases in 
violence as well. Dialogue 
between 
SAPAC

— helping facilitate a program to 
improve the city’s low-income 
public housing. He acknowledged, 
however, that there is still progress 
to be made in those areas, which 
is what motivated him to run for 
re-election. 

“We have a roads plan, but 

many streets remain dangerous for 
pedestrians and cyclists,” the press 
release read. “We have rehabbed 
our public housing system, but 
we have done little to build new 
workforce housing — housing for 
our teachers, retirees, restaurant 
workers, and young professionals.”

Recently, many residents have 

expressed frustration with the city’s 
lackluster progress on pedestrian 
safety after a local high school 
student was killed while crossing 
the street on his way to school.

In a February meeting of City 

Council, 
Ackerman 
supported 

a resolution to review President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
executive 

order ceasing federal grants for 
“sanctuary jurisdictions,” while 
expressing concerns about the 
future of public housing.

“We need to be wary of slashes 

to federal funding, and I’ll only 
say, to me, that comes in the form 
of federal funding to our Section 
8 programs,” he said. “These are 
programs in the city that distribute 
up to 1,300 vouchers for housing to 
those who otherwise may be living 
on the streets.”

out, except if you’re targeting 
Jewish students at the University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Greenstein 

said. “In that case, the record 
is clear that the University 
administration 
will 
remain 

silent and take no action.”

In response to Greenstein’s 

comments, Schlissel reiterated 
previous statements denouncing 
both racism and anti-Semitism 
as unacceptable on campus.

“Bigotry 
of 
any 
kind 
is 

unacceptable in our community 
and I’ve said so countless times,” 
Schlissel said. “Bigotry includes 
bigotry on the basis of race, 
ethnicity and on religion. Anti-
Semitism is not tolerated here or 
elsewhere and should not be.”

Despite 
these 
remarks, 

community speakers continued 
to step up reaffirm the previous 
statements. 
University 
alum 

Sheldon Freilich outlined four 
steps he said the University 
should take to reverse “double 
standards” when responding to 
anti-Semitism.

“Concrete steps that this 

University should take include 
the following four,” he said. 
“Disciplinary 
measures 
for 

those 
who 
commit 
anti-

Semitic bigotry, publicly and 
forcefully 
labeling 
incidents 

that are explicitly anti-Semitic 
… 
educating 
teachers 
and 

students about the dangers of 
anti-Semitism … and informing 
all students of the school’s 
procedures and policies when 
seeking redress for incidents of 
discrimination and harassment.”

In his address to the board 

earlier in the meeting, LSA 
senior David Schafer, president 
of Central Student Government, 
said students on campus who 

were not affected by recent 
attacks contribute to an attitude 
of apathy.

“This is something that we 

can and must address in some 
form or another if we hope 
to empower more students to 
become allies,” he said. “An 
offense against any member of 
the Michigan community is an 
offense against all. When one 
student or one community is 
made to feel unsafe … that must 
matter to all of us, even if it’s not 
someone that we know.”

The executive board of the 

Black Student Union attended 
the event, wearing all black in 
solidarity. LSA sophomore Jesse 
Love, political actions chair of 
the Black Student Union, said 
the University’s response was 
inadequate 
and 
measurable 

action must be taken.

“We want to the University 

to know, although we couldn’t 
get a speaking time, that 
our 
presence 
is 
definitely 

something that’s going to be 
felt and that this is an issue that 
we have with the University,” 
he said. “Obviously it’s not 
every day that we come to 
Regents meetings, but we felt 
it was specifically necessary 
that we come to this meeting 
so that they can see that their 
inaction did not go unnoticed.”

Recreation 
Facility 

Changes

The 
Regents 
approved 

$21 million in renovations 
to 
the 
Bennie 
Oosterbaan 

Field House, among other 
construction 
plans. 
The 

project consists of building 
a 
32,000-square-foot 

performance 
center 
within 

the 
fieldhouse 
for 
use 

by 
the 
football 
program. 

Additionally, the plan calls 
for 
a 
5,000-square-foot 

mezzanine level to be created. 
Other 
renovations, 
such 

as 
upgrading 
heating 
and 

ventilation, will also be made 
to address safety concerns.

Prior to the plan’s approval, 

Business junior Nate Fisher, 
president of the men’s club 
rugby team, asked the Regents 
to delay the project. Fisher 
spoke on behalf of the 31 club 
sports teams at the University, 
citing that almost a third of 
these teams utilize Oosterbaan 
for practice and competition. 
The construction, he said, 
would hurt their programs.

“The 
reduction 
of 

Oosterbaan translates to fewer 
hours of practice to refine 
skills, fewer scrimmages to 
prepare 
against 
opponents, 

fewer games and less time to 
become a team that is capable 
of 
upholding 
the 
prestige 

expected of students at the 
University,” he said.

Fisher 
noted 
club 

sports 
allow 
students 
to 

gain 
leadership 
skills 
and 

interact 
with 
alumni 
and 

administration. 
He 
cited 

that in recent years, teams 
that practice in Oosterbaan 
have 
attended 
National 

Championships 25 times and 
won five titles.

“Oosterbaan is very valuable 

due to its size and indoor 
benefits,” he said. “Seven out of 
the nine teams require a space 
the same size as Oosterbaan 
with 
a 
similar 
ceiling 

height 
to 
play 
sanctioned 

games, and together we play 
approximately 
35 
games. 

The renovated indoor track 
building that (the University 
Athletic 
Department) 

described will not meet these 
league standards or have the 
additional run-off room on the 
sidelines for safety.”

Among other things, Fisher 

noted that, if the capacity 
of Oosterbaan is reduced, as 

suggested by the proposal, 
only one team could practice 
safety at a time.

Administrative 

Appointments

The Regents made two major 

administrative 
appointments 

Thursday afternoon.

Kallie 
Bila 
Michels 
was 

appointed 
full-time 
vice 

president for communications. 
After serving as associate vice 
president for communications 
since 2008, Michels will take on 
the role of chief communications 
officer, 
working 
with 
the 

Board of Regents and other 
executive officers to organize 
communications and marketing-
related initiatives. She will also 
oversee the University’s social 
media outlets.

The action request signed 

by Schlissel said Michels will 
be responsible for enhancing 
the university’s reputation and 
visibility locally, nationally, and 
internationally. It will also work 
to position and differentiate 
the University among leading 
institutions of higher education.

The 
board 
also 
confirmed 

Elizabeth B. Moje as dean of the 
School of Education. Moje is 
currently serving as interim dean 
and teaches classes in secondary 
and adolescent literacy, cultural 
theory and research methods. Her 
research focuses on youth literacy 
in Detroit, specifically addressing 
the intersection of disciplinary 
literacies of school and literacy in 
and out of school.

The action request signed by 

Interim Provost Paul Courant, 
in his first official appearance 
before the board as interim 
provost, says Moje’s “enthusiasm 
and dedication” to the School of 
Education is evident in all her 
work.

Michels assumes her position on 

Feb. 17, while Moje’s appointment 
takes effect on March 1.

said. “It’s about investing in 
Michigan’s future to create 
jobs.”

At the State of State address 

in 
January, 
Snyder 
made 

infrastructure improvements a 
main pillar of his speech.

“Michigan residents deserve 

safe, 
reliable, 
sustainable 

infrastructure,” Snyder said. 
“We need to invest more, we 
need to literally invest billions 
of dollars of new investment 
over the next several decades.”

Including 6 percent sales 

tax and excluding the federal 
gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, 
Michigan’s combined tax rate 
will total about 37.8 cents per 
gallon, the fifth highest in the 
nation 
after 
Pennsylvania, 

Washington 
state, 
Hawaii 

and New York. Federal tax 
revenue will not go toward 
infrastructure repairs.

This increased cost will place 

a significant burden on drivers, 
especially student drivers, such 
as LSA freshman Catharine 
Greenberg.

Greenberg, 
a 
resident 
of 

Vermont, 
said, 
though 
her 

state’s harsh weather should 
yield 
similar 
damage 
to 

its 
infrastructure 
system, 

Michigan’s roads are in far 
worse condition.

“My first time driving in 

Michigan, it was very obvious 
that 
the 
roads 
weren’t 
as 

comfortable 
to 
drive 
on,” 

Greenberg said.

Though most of Greenberg’s 

driving is done in Vermont, she 
has a car on campus, which 
she said is becoming more 
expensive than she expected.

“My car doesn’t get great 

gas mileage,” Greenberg said. 
“For a college student trying to 
scrape things together, that’s 
going to cost me about four 
dollars extra each time I fill 
up my tank, which is a really 
significant amount.”

Despite 
this 
relatively 

large change in gas prices, 

Sam 
Beydaun, 
manager 
of 

University Fuel Mart on Main 
Street, said he has not seen any 
changes in demand for gasoline 
at his station.

“The price of gas changes 

so much on its own that I 

don’t think people paid much 
attention to the 7 cent increase,” 
Beydaun said. “It seems like 
just another fluctuation.”

Many 
Michigan 
residents 

have stressed the urgency with 
which 
infrastructure 
needs 

to be repaired. The package, 
which was announced in 2015 
and included taxes that did 
not take effect until 2017, does 

not allow revenue to go toward 
roads until fiscal year 2019. The 
full dedication of revenue to 
roads will not be available until 
fiscal year 2021.

The $455 million in expected 

tax revenue actually replaces 
the 
$400 
million 
allocated 

by the state’s general fund 
to go toward infrastructure 
improvements in the 2015-2016 
fiscal year. The $400 million 
amount was not in the current 
fiscal year budget.

In addition to the increased 

gas tax, annual registration 
fees for cars, vans, light trucks 
and commercial trucks will 
rise 20 percent. Prior to the 
increase, the average annual 
fee was $120. With the 20 
percent increase in place, an 
additional $24 will be charged, 
making the total fee $144. Gas-
electric hybrid vehicles will 
experience an average increase 
of $47, and electric vehicles will 
experience an average increase 
of $135.

Democrats have expressed 

concern that with such large 

sums of money coming out of 
the state’s budget to fund the 
parts of the project not covered 
by tax revenue, less money 
will be available for issues like 
health care and education.

State 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi 

(D–Ann Arbor) said taking 
money from the general fund 
was a reckless decision that 
will not solve Michigan’s roads 
problems.

“We 
should 
never 
have 

touched the state’s general 
fund,” 
Rabhi 
said. 
“It 
is 

just 
fiscally 
irresponsible, 

especially since 1.2 million isn’t 
even enough to fix our roads. 
We are looking at cutting 600 
million from our budget, and it’s 
a year after year expenditure.”

No 
conversations 
have 

taken place to discuss what 
programs could potentially lose 
funding, despite the inevitable 
losses. Rabhi speculated this 
conversation is not taking place 
because supporters of the tax 
are trying to avoid a public 
relations “nightmare.”

“It’s just another example of 

the government being treated 
like an ATM,” Rabhi said.

Rabhi agreed that fixing 

Michigan’s roads is a critical 
issue that needs to be addressed. 
However, he said he does not 
think the state has addressed it 
efficiently and fairly.

“The thing that I am cautious 

about it that it is a regressive 
tax,” Rabhi said. “People with 
lower 
incomes 
pay 
higher 

percentages of their income 
because of it. I think an ad 
valorem tax would make it 
more fair.”

Though the increases are 

significant, Beydaun said, when 
boiled down, the issue at hand 
is simple and uncontroversial.

“The 
revenue 
is 
going 

towards a good cause,” Beydaun 
said. “I don’t think anyone has a 
problem with it. We need to fix 
the roads.”

State Rep. Kevin Cotter (R–

Mount Pleasant), who orginially 
aided in manufacturing the 
intrastructure funding plan, 
did not respond to request for 
comment.

It’s about 

investing in 

Michigan’s future 

to create jobs

then build on one’s own knowledge 
to help others.

“We have to get quiet enough to 

hear where the cries for healing are 
coming from,” McCoy said. “What 
can I use to speak from my tradition 
to be able to answer the call?”

The event was the first in a series 

of three, aimed to build coalitions 
between the organizations and 
identity groups on campus in 
order to bring about joint civic 
engagement, according to LSA 
senior Zara Melitts, a member of 
Hillel.

McCoy also led a communication 

and relationship building activity 
her organization uses to guide 
attendees 
in 
the 
process 
of 

addressing grievances across lines 
of disagreement and identity.

LSA sophomore Vivian Obia 

described how the activity helped 
her work through experiences 

she had in confronting peers who 
had voted for President Donald 
Trump.

“Even while you’re dealing 

with (situations like that), you 
still have to find peace within 
yourself in some type of way,” 
Obia said. “At the end of the day, 
even if we do disagree on things, 
I still know who I am as a person, 
and this has honestly allowed me 
to love myself even more even 
with all that’s going on.”

LSA senior Micah Griggs, 

vice 
president 
of 
Central 

Student Government, said she 
appreciated 
McCoy’s 
words 

and acknowledged her ability to 
put current political climate in 
perspective.

“(McCoy) really put things 

in perspective, that we need to 
acknowledge and appreciate how 
people feel, and give ourselves 
space and support when things 
like this happen on campus 
and learn and realize we can 
move forward as communities 
together,” she said.

TROTTER

S

imilar to many University 
of 
Michigan 
students, 

I pride myself on my 

critical 
thinking 

and analytical skills. 
By now, as I careen 
toward 
graduation 

without brakes, I feel 
I am fairly well versed 
in deriving meaning 
from 
everything. 
I 

can sprout arguments 
about anything from 
yogurt advertisements 
to complex issues, such 
as whether or not a 
five-year-old would make 
an effective president. However, 
I seem to have one massive 
shortcoming: I am somehow 
inexcusably, 
consistently 
and 

massively gullible, and I am not 
alone in this. When it comes to 
what we read online, it seems 
that all of us are consistently and 
problematically easy to fool.

My professors have tried to train 

this out of me by demonstrating 
how to challenge the ideas put 
in front of me by engaging with 
them skeptically, yet I am still 
one of the most gullible people I 
know. Recently, a friend joked that 
our professor’s first name wasn’t 
actually Seder but Apple Cider. 
And I 100 percent believed him. 
I don’t think he was even trying 
to trick me. I just said to myself, 
“Sure, why not,” and accepted it.

While I’d like to attribute my 

occasional readiness to believe 
what I’m told to my inherent 
belief in the good of others, I 
think the truth might have more 
to do with me being an idiot 
or having too much blind faith 
that my friends won’t steer me 
wrong. Perhaps even more likely 
is that I have a lazy streak when 
it comes to fact checking, and 
I know I’m not alone in this. 
As Americans saw repeatedly 
during this past election, fake 
news (stories that are completely 
fabricated or bent so far from the 
truth as to be unrecognizable 
as reality) is increasingly an 
issue on social media, spreading 
baseless conspiracy theories and 
misinformation, like the claim 

that the Pope endorsed President 
Donald Trump or that former 
President Barack Obama tried 

to ban the Pledge of 
Allegiance.

Fake news might 

not be an issue if 
not for the fact that 
a large majority of 
people is falling for 
it. According to a 
study from Stanford’s 
History 
Education 

Group, students are 
alarmingly 
bad 
at 

spotting fake news 

and were unable to draw 

logical conclusions about the bias, 
source validity and factuality 
of what they were reading. This 
can have some pretty massive 
implications for our democracy. 
Voting relies on the assumption 
that voters can make educated 
decisions, which requires having 
valid information. How do we 
make informed decisions when we 
can’t know what’s true?

Facebook 
has 
reportedly 

begun taking steps to correct the 
prominence of fake news on its site, 
but it might be too late; knowing 
that there is convincing fake news 
circulating, it seems as if nothing 
is trustworthy. With the rising 
distrust of the media, how do we 
know what is real? What’s true? 
This implication that the media 
can’t be trusted at all is scarier 
and harder to battle than simply 
having to see articles circulating 
on Facebook that Senate Majority 
Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) 
is actually part turtle.

Beyond the confusion that this 

matter presents to citizens about 
what and whom to believe, an 
even more concerning trend is 
being revealed: Politicians now 
have the simple cop-out response 
of calling things that they disagree 
with or don’t like “fake news.” 
Recently, Syrian President Bashar 
al-Assad used this claim of “fake 
news” in regards to an Amnesty 
International report that cited 
human 
rights 
violations 
in 

military prisons under his regime.

In dismissing the report as fake, 

Assad demonstrated how simple 

it is to make massive problems 
essentially disappear. He didn’t 
want to respond to the allegations, 
so he discredited them without 
proof, and suddenly it’s just his 
word against the media’s.

Assad isn’t the only one using 

this tactic: Trump and his staff 
are also known for crying “fake 
news” when unflattering stories 
surface. “Saturday Night Live” 
even spoofed such an occurrence 
when an actor representing CNN 
had to plead from a cage during 
a press briefing that “We’re not 
fake news!” 

Herein lies the real danger 

of 
this 
phenomenon. 
In 

creating a quick, plausible 
excuse to cast aspersions on 
the media, it creates a space for 
the subjects of those stories, 
namely politicians, to create 
their own convenient truths 
and realities.

Unfortunately, there doesn’t 

seem to be a simple way out of 
this. Regaining trust is easier 
said than done, especially when 
it comes to an industry like mass 
media, which we are inherently 
asked to trust.

John Oliver had a segment 

on his HBO show, “Last Week 
Tonight,” this past week, in which 
he issued a plea for personal 
responsibility in fact checking, 
asking viewers to “commit to 
defending the reality of facts” on 
a personal level: “Ask questions 
of yourself, like, ‘is this a source I 
know and recognize? Has anyone 
fact checked this? Does it link to 
primary sources? And do those 
sources match what the story 
says?’ ” Oliver suggests.

Really, all I can do is request 

that every concerned citizen 
questions what they are being 
told, whether it’s coming from 
friends, social media or authority 
figures. Every single one of us 
can work on our inductive and 
deductive reasoning skills, and 
I would know, because I’ve been 
told it’s true and who am I to 
question it?

E

ven before the election, 
my county served as a 
huge lure for journalists 

who were hungry for 
a peek into the lives of 
traditional, working-
class individuals. In 
the 1980s, the term 
“Reagan Democrat” 
was 
coined 
about 

its 
residents 
in 

reference 
to 
blue 

collar workers who 
flipped 
Republican 

after a long track 
record 
of 
voting 

Democrat. This year, 
Rolling Stone labeled 
Macomb 
County, 
Michigan, 

“Trump County, USA” in a 
provocative headline, and the 
Guardian seemed to dismiss 
us as lazy hicks who blissfully 
refuse to read the news. But 
despite all the bad publicity, 
it is important to note that 
not 
everyone 
in 
Macomb 

County voted for Trump, and 
many residents of the area are 
actually pretty progressive — 
just not in ways that are easily 
recognizable to University of 
Michigan students. 

For 
context, 
Macomb 

County is located in southeast 
Michigan and is known for 
being 
predominantly 
white 

and working class. The area’s 
historical reliance on the auto 
industry means the effects of 
globalization, outsourcing and 
the 2008 financial crisis not only 
decimated the economy over 
time, but destroyed the trust 
of its residents in government 
as well. In local elections, folks 
still tend to vote Democrat. On 
the national stage, however, 
thinning 
patience 
with 

establishment politics has made 
it increasingly likely for an 
outsider candidate to triumph 
over a career politician, if only 
for the sheer satisfaction of 
“sticking it to the man.”

But while these people are 

tired and angry, that anger does 
not always translate into bigotry. 
In fact, most of my friends back 
home hold fundamental views 
that closely match those of the 
average left-leaning University 
of Michigan student, though 
they would still probably be 

ostracized in elite liberal circles 
for being problematic or ignorant. 
This is because the standard 

for 
sociopolitical 

consciousness 
at 

the 
University 
is 

extremely 
high 
— 

students 
here 
are 

hyper-aware of their 
own prejudices and 
assumptions and have 
adopted the habit of 
routinely 
checking 

themselves 
to 

accommodate others.

While 
this 
is 

an 
incredible 
feat 

for us, people who 

have had little exposure to 
academia or progressive spaces 
(by no fault of their own) 
are not conditioned to do the 
same and can seem rude or 
unsophisticated at times as a 
result of their inexperience. 

Part 
of 
this 
outgroup 

scrutiny, I think, is rooted in 
our inability to acknowledge 
the privileges we have as college 
students. After all, in many 
ways, a commitment to activism 
is a commitment to incessant 
education. By attending an elite 
institution, we are afforded 
both time and a myriad of 
resources to better ourselves, 
to reading and interacting with 
people who have had a variety 
of experiences and hold views 
that are different from our 
own. Questioning our beliefs, 
analyzing our implicit biases and 
evaluating our positionalities 
(even just knowing what the 
word 
positionality 
means) 

takes a focused kind of energy 
that is not so easily attainable 
outside 
academia. 
Moreover, 

having a place to intellectualize 
our 
everyday 
experiences 

and 
synthesize 
multiple 

perspectives is something a lot 
of us encounter for the first time 
in college — and not everyone is 
lucky enough to go to college. We 
tend to forget the significance of 
this when we critique others for 
their shortcomings.

Consequently, 
progressive 

circles 
lend 
themselves 
to 

a kind of tragic irony: As 
they become more and more 
committed to inclusivity, they 
unknowingly shut out people 
who don’t meet their standards 
of tolerance and consciousness. 
Outsiders who are not so 
attuned 
to 
these 
rapidly 

evolving 
ideologies 
— 
who 

occasionally flub a pronoun 
or butcher a name they have 
never encountered before — are 
often written off as insensitive 
or ignorant without further 
analysis. In our dismissal of 
what we interpret as bigotry, 
we alienate people who may 
otherwise be open to learning; 
we turn progressive politics 
into an exclusive club reserved 
for only the most educated and 
conscientious 
while 
failing 

to acknowledge that progress 
itself 
implies 
a 
constant 

movement toward something 
better — a spectrum rather 
than an absolute.

Moving forward, we cannot 

be 
so 
quick 
to 
repudiate 

people we perceive as being 
less educated on the issues 
than ourselves. It is time to 
turn our sermons of tolerance 
and acceptance inward — to 
understand that not everyone 
can stay on top of the latest 
developments 
in 
progressive 

theory, as they may not have 
access to spaces in which this 
information is readily available. 
Be patient and learn to recognize 
that the ability to pursue higher 
education and all that it entails 
is an advantage that very few 
can access. Our job is to relay 
the information we learn here 
to others, not look down at 
them from our high horses 
because they cannot explain 
concepts like intersectionality 
in sufficient detail.

LEESON

I 

am a relatively recent 
transfer 
admit 
to 
the 

University of Michigan’s 

College 
of 
Engineering. 
I 

am also a severely disabled 
student. At age 19, I was a 
sophomore here when I suffered 
an Arteriovenous Malformation, 
a brain hemorrhage that left 
me with signs of a stroke. 
After being in a coma for three 
months, I awoke, not being 
able to do anything. After 
countless physical therapists, 
occupational 
therapists 
and 

doctors, I am now 30 and 
excited to continue studying at 
this famed University.

Charm and friendliness are 

predominant features in my 
journey back to the University 
of Michigan. One of my first 
experiences started with a visit 
to Services for Students with 
Disabilities. The people there 
were very accommodating and 
helpful in getting me whatever 
I needed, be it providing me 
with scribes or note takers or 
securing transportation to and 
from my classes. Without this 
help, I would not have been able 
to overcome the new hurdles 
that arose after the accident. All 
the people from the University 
of 
Michigan 
have 
been 

exceptionally helpful. Without 
their expert help, I would not be 
able to attend the University’s 
College of Engineering.

My 
caregivers 
at 
the 

University 
have 
been 

wonderful. I need caregivers 
for all my daily tasks of living. 
While there are not many of 
them, they became some of 
my closest friends on campus. 
They help me by being diligent 
and kind in their services to 
me. Without these select few, 
my experience here would be 
more challenging.

The student body has also 

been a pleasant surprise to me, 
providing me with comfort 
and making me feel at home. 
It has touched me how they 

really cared about me. One 
instance was when the girl 
who usually sits behind me in 
my aerospace engineering class 
said “Hi!” to me when we were 
in an Aerospace Engineering 
Department 
meeting. 
Even 

though it was such a small 
gesture, it meant the world to 
me. I have been waiting for a 
fellow student to extend that 
common courtesy to me for 
the longest time. My faith in 
humanity was restored by how 
much of a heart the student body 
at the University of Michigan 
has. They made me feel a part of 
their community, which I have 
wanted all along.

What also helps immensely 

is 
the 
presence 
of 
student 

organizations. I was a member 
of a student group with disabled 
students and their friends called 
Students with Disabilities and 
Our Allies Group. One example 
of how their behavior changed 
my life was in one of the first 
meetings of the group, they 
asked me if I had any thoughts. 
I told them that I wished the 
group could convene in a place 
more accessible to those who 
do not live on Central Campus. 
They helped me by enabling me 
to participate as a member of a 
group. Without the student body, 
I would not have had the courage 
to speak up in my other student 
groups up on North Campus.

It was not only general 

student groups that welcomed 
and included me back into the 
University. I can’t image this 
experience without the students 
and faculty in the Aerospace 
Engineering Department. Both 
students and faculty gave me 
a great opportunity in my first 
aerospace engineering lab. This 
class was special because we 
learned how to design, build and 
test a hovercraft from scratch.

Another great experience I 

had was one with the aerospace 
technicians’ 
office 
in 
the 

Francois-Xavier 
Bagnoud 

Building. I could go in the tech’s 
office and set down all my 
stuff for the day and it would 
be there at the end of the day. 
I sometimes have 10 or more 
pounds of various assistive 
technologies and my personal 
stuff to carry around with me in 
a single day, so you can tell I am 
obviously appreciative because 
I could find a little place, with 
the aerospace techs, where I 
could set my stuff down. They 
even have a desk in their office 
just for me. This is not an 
option for everybody; I only got 
it after going to their office for 
many months. I met some of the 
most influential people in my 
journey at the University in the 
tech’s center. I think I found 
one of the “hidden treasures” of 
University of Michigan’s North 
Campus in FXB.

Initially, 
navigating 
the 

“system” and life after the 
accident made me feel like 
I 
could 
never 
return 
to 

accomplish the dreams I had 
prior to it. Now, I realize that 
I deserve to be a student and 
nothing can stop me in my 
dream of becoming the first 
disabled person in space. I feel 
it is of the utmost importance 
to always have a dream. The 
dream is what keeps me alive. 
Without the dream, I would 
not be where I am: at the 
University of Michigan.

I know I have a long way to 

go before accomplishing my 
dream, but if you had seen 
me in the appalling position 
I was stuck in after my AVM, 
you would be floored at how 
far I have come. Going back to 
college was just my first step 
in accomplishing my dream. 
One day, I will be a success. 
I will strive to live up to the 
strict standards placed on 
me by being a student at this 
prestigious University.

HBO’s “Crashing” shines

A cynical wit and star-studded cast make Pete Holmes’s show a hit

In recent years, HBO has 

made a concerted effort to 
expand its comedy offerings. 
With 
series 
like 
“Veep,” 

“Ballers” and “Silicon Valley,” 
the network has attempted 
to establish itself as more 
than just “Game of Thrones.” 
Following 
the 
premiere 

of 
its 
new 

Judd 
Apatow-

produced (“The 
40-Year-Old 
Virgin”) comedy 
“Crashing,” HBO 
should be able to 
add another hit 
to 
its 
growing 

lineup. 
Despite 

its 
familiar 

premise, 
“Crashing” 
is 

expertly cast and scored, and 
contains an enjoyable brand of 
dark, self-deprecating humor 
that audiences can appreciate.

Created by rising comedic 

star Pete Holmes (“The Pete 
Holmes Show”), the series 
centers on Holmes’ fictional 
life as a middling comedian 
struggling to navigate the 
New York City comedy club 
scene. After leaving his wife, 
the hilarious Lauren Lapkus 
(“Jurassic World”), Holmes 
finds himself on the street, 
where a chance encounter 
with a washed-up Artie Lange 
(“Howard Stern on Demand”) 
results in his getting a new 
mentor. Along with Lange, the 
show 
features 
appearances 

from a number of prominent 
comedians, 
including 
the 

perpetually-cynical T.J. Miller 
(“Deadpool”) 
and 
anointed 

“RoastMaster General” Jeff 
Ross (“Comedy Central Roast 
of Charlie Sheen”).

For “Crashing,” its success 

is largely due to its talented 
core of comedic veterans. Each 
cast member occupies their 
own comedic niche, and their 
chemistry 
together 
shines 

through 
from 
the 
series’ 

initial 
scenes. 
Holmes 
is 

brilliant as a naïve, optimistic 
comedian attempting to break 
into an industry infamous for 
its sardonic wit. Despite her 
relatively minor part, Lapkus 

distinguishes 
herself 
with 

her 
blunt, 

biting 
style 
of 

humor. Lange is 
similarly 
solid 

within his role 
as a burnt-out 
comedian 
who 

never misses an 
opportunity 
to 

mock his own situation. As 
brief as his appearances are, 
Miller excels at delivering 
his 
trademark 
style 
of 

brash, juvenile humor. In a 
particularly hilarious scene, 
Miller becomes upset with 
Lange and begins an all-out 
verbal assault on his outfit, 
telling him: “You look like you 
work for a homeless person. 
Are you interning on skid row? 
What cargo are you carrying in 
cargo pants? Are you carrying 
nostalgia for the ’90s?”

Along 
with 
its 
cast, 

“Crashing” benefits from the 
strength of its soundtrack. 
Featuring 
acclaimed 
soul-

men Charles Bradley and Leon 
Bridges, the show uses its score 
to emphasize the melancholic 
aspects of Holmes’s life — he’s 
left his wife and continues to 
struggle to establish himself 
as a comedian. The songs are 
chosen well to coincide with 
more depressing scenes, but 
they remain confined to the 

series’s background to not 
disrupt the show’s overall 
lighthearted mood.

Outside of its soundtrack, 

“Crashing” suffers from its 
relatively 
weak 
storyline 

and, at times, narrow type 
of humor that is constantly 
repeated. The show opens 
with the rather trite plot line 
of Holmes coming home early 
one day to discover his wife’s 
infidelity 
firsthand, 
before 

immediately leaving her. This 
narrative is not only overused 
but 
also 
hastily 
executed, 

with the series glossing over 
Holmes’ 
wife’s 
affair 
and 

largely ignoring the storyline 
after the show’s premiere 
episode. “Crashing” is further 
hurt by the fact that its writing 
is unbalanced and, in several 
instances, relies too heavily 
upon the nature of Holmes’s 
life as its sole style of humor. 
The series elects to mold 
many of its jokes around this 
idea, and, while sometimes 
funny, 
these 
gags 
become 

repetitive and leave audiences 
questioning the extent of the 
show’s comedic range.

Despite 
its 
occasionally 

weak 
writing, 
the 
series 

remains 
entertaining 
and 

produces a stream of laughs. 
Viewers can’t help but enjoy 
Holmes’s naiveté juxtaposed 
with Lange’s no-holds-barred 
approach 
that 
produces 
a 

show replete with quality 
gags. In “Crashing,” Holmes 
has succeeded in capitalizing 
on the show’s star-studded 
cast to develop a program that 
has terrific dark humor, and 
it’s pure fun to follow along.

“Crashing” will premiere on 

HBO Sunday, Feb. 19.

‘Freude!’ — The politics of art

A week ago I finally got 

around to doing something 
which 
I 
probably 
should 

have done a few years ago. 
Sitting somewhere up in the 
left mezzanine (I’m not sure 
precisely where — my ticket 
has since become a bookmark 
in 
something 
or 
another), 

knees askew and jutting out 
uncomfortably into the seat-
back in front of me, I finally 
saw a live performance of 
Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, 
his “Ode to Joy,” as part of an 
all-Beethoven program that 
spanned 
nearly 
a 
quarter-

century of the composer’s life.

Under the baton of Iván 

Fischer, 
last 
Friday 
Hill 

Auditorium was host to the 
Budapest Festival Orchestra, 
one of the world’s leading 
symphonic 
concert 
groups. 

Before the performance began 
— 
indeed, 
before 

the orchestra was 
even on the stage 
— 
the 
longtime 

president of UMS, 
Ken Fischer (who 
is retiring at the 
end of this season, 
after 30 years with 
the 
organization), 

took 
the 
stage 

to 
introduce 
the 

musicians. 
In 

his 
remarks, 
Mr. 

Fischer included the usual 
comments about how pleased 
UMS was to welcome the 
orchestra, but the end of his 
speech 
included 
a 
rather 

unique 
tag: 
The 
orchestra 

was thrilled to be here that 
night, including every member 
of the cello section. “If you 
don’t know what I’m talking 
about,” Fischer said, “ask your 
neighbor, or take a look at the 
New York Times.” And then we 
heard Beethoven.

Well, to my surprise, I didn’t 

know what he was talking 
about, and I’m altogether too 
shy to ask a neighbor about 
anything. But it really didn’t 
take an extraordinary degree 
of 
deductive 
reasoning 
to 

hypothesize about the situation 
— and after the concert a quick 
Google 
search 
confirmed 

what I had already suspected. 
“An 
Orchestra 
Triumphs 

Over Trump’s Travel Ban,” 
the headline read. It seems 
that our amateur president 
hadn’t quite thought through 
the nuances and complexities 
of his “complete and total 
shutdown” idea (to say nothing 
of its legality or morality), 
and in the chaotic hours and 
days following the ban’s ham-
handed implementation, the 
Budapest Festival Orchestra’s 
US tour was jeopardized by the 
fact that one of their cellists 
was being told that he could 
not enter the country because 
of his dual Hungarian/Iraqi 
citizenship. 
Fischer 
(Iván, 

that is) lodged a complaint 

with the State Department, 
and a day later, following an 
international 
effort, 
dual-

passport holders were deemed 
to be exempt from the ban.

Let this be a lesson: Art is 

not immune from politics.

Not that many people would 

have seriously suggested the 
opposite, but often it seems 
that 
art 
serves 
for 
many 

people as an escape from 
the 
increasingly-alarming 

information 
surrounding 

national 
and 
international 

affairs. In the last few weeks 
I’ve certainly used it in such a 
manner. And that’s fine, even 
necessary — art can be an 
emotional balm for artist and 
recipient alike. But we also 
can’t ignore the fact that art is a 
political act. Perhaps it doesn’t 
always mean to be, just as 
sometimes it does, and maybe 

not everyone notices 
that 
it’s 
political. 

But 
ultimately, 

like 
almost 
every 

decision made, like 
the 
act 
of 
living 

itself, art is one of 
the infinite intricate 
pieces of the vast 
world machine we 
describe through the 
lens of politics. Art 
reflects life and life 
reflects art — and 

right now especially, both are 
pretty full of politics.

In light of this, it was fitting 

that the centerpiece of the 
Budapest Festival Orchestra’s 
concert was Beethoven’s 9th 
symphony, a work which was 
meant as a paean of universal 
brotherhood — a fact which was 
not lost on Doyle Armbrust, 
who wrote the remarkably 
unconventional program notes 
for the UMS concert. But by 
this point — perhaps because 
of its universal popularity, 
or maybe because of its sheer 
brilliance 
— 
Beethoven’s 

symphony has sort of become 
the go-to example of a political 
composition. I wrote about it on 
November 9th, my insomnia-
addled 
mind 
desperately 

seeking 
for 
some 
small 

consolation or sliver of solace, 
and the New Yorker’s ever-
eloquent Alex Ross discusses 
it 
in 
his 
characteristically 

percipient 
article 
“Making 

Art in a Time of Rage” on 
February 8th (Ross also gave a 
shout-out to Armbrust). All of 
which makes sense: Beethoven 
himself meant it as a statement, 
and was a rather political 
person. As a republican living 
under the careful watch of 
Metternich’s secret police in 
autocratic Vienna, the failure 
of the French Revolution and 
the imposition of the arch-
conservative post-Napoleonic 
order surely ranked among one 
of his many sorrows in life.

But 
Beethoven 
certainly 

isn’t the only composer to 

deal with political topics. The 
first opera I ever truly loved 
was “Nixon in China,” the 
1987 work that springboarded 
the American composer John 
Adams to prominence. Though 
I had enjoyed various operas 
I saw before, until “Nixon” I 
had never loved one with the 
same sort of unreserved, fierce 
and unabashed abandon which 
characterized 
my 
feelings 

towards Adams’s composition. 
And part of this love, I think, 
stemmed from the fact that 
“Nixon” dove directly into the 
political, raising ethical and 
moral questions in the context 
of beautiful art, aided by Alice 
Goodman’s stunning libretto.

Adam’s does this in other 

works as well — his opera 
“Doctor Atomic” deals with 
the subject of nuclear war, and 
the highly controversial opera 
“The Death of Klinghoffer” 
focuses on the 1985 hijacking 
of 
a 
passenger 
liner 
by 

Palestinian 
terrorists. 
This 

last work especially waded 
into the public fray of the 
emotionally fraught politics 
of 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 

conflict, and the opera has 
been accused of antisemitism 
(which 
its 
creators 
deny) 

and of being sympathetic to 
terrorism 
(what, 
after 
all, 

does it mean if terrorists are 
able to sing beautifully?). But 
setting aside the specifics of 
these examples, all of them 
demonstrate 
that 
art 
and 

politics are often inextricable. 
One cannot create art without 
participating in the world, and 
to some degree or another, this 
means that art will turn out 
to have political implications. 
And often art can help us 
better understand the political 
world we experience. Though 
Adams has recently stated in 
an interview with KQED: “The 
idea of a Trump opera doesn’t 
interest (him) in the least,” 
because “you don’t want to 
spend time as an artist giving 
your very best to a person who 
is a sociopath.” The work he 
has done on previous projects 
can still provide insights into 
the contemporary climate.

As I look around at the way 

events are unfolding today, I’m 
put in mind of a scene from 
“Nixon.” In it, the president is 
in discussion with Mao Zedong 
and Premier Zhou Enlai when 
the Premier addresses Mao.

“You’ve said that there’s a 

certain well-known tree that 
grows from nothing in a day, 
lives only as a sapling, dies just 
at its prime when good men 
raise it as their idol.”

“Not the cross?” ventures 

Nixon.

“The Liberty Tree,” comes 

Mao’s reply. “It was a riddle, 
not a test.”

But perhaps now the riddle 

has become a test for us all.

NYFW REVIEW
Ulla debuts first runway

Ulla Johnson is killing it. Last 

Thursday, she debuted the Fall 
2017 ready-to-wear collection for 
her eponymous brand. This marks 
her first ever runway show for New 
York Fashion Week — a hallmark 
of success for any designer, and 
a particularly poignant one for 
Johnson whose brand has been 
growing since its inception in 
2000.

A psychology major, Johnson 

had not always envisioned a future 
in fashion. However, traveling 
alongside 
her 
archaeologist 

parents instilled in her a love of 
textiles. Shortly after graduating 
college, she began her business, 
much to the chagrin of her parents, 
who tried to discourage her from 

a future in fashion. Originally 
self-financed, the brand gained 
traction when Barneys picked up 
the line.

“I think ultimately Barneys 

(came to us because of the fact that 
we feel more intimate, because 
we’re not a gigantic brand that’s 
in a big department store, because 
people want something that is 
not so insanely visible and just 
feels like product,” Johnson told 
Fashionista back in 2014. Even 
as the brand snowballed, it was 
important to Johnson that it grow 
organically. By keeping the brand 
at a size she could financially 
support, Johnson never had to 
relinquish her vision and was able 
to maintain a high standard. This 
ultimately fostered the brand’s 
popularity and ushered in the 
success it currently enjoys.

The collection shown Thursday 

was massively successful; it can 

be summed up as “Little House 
on the Prairie” x knitwear x ’70s x 
Valentine’s Day. Feminine, but not 
cloyingly so. Cool, but not effortful. 
Vintage-inspired, but not stale. 
While Ulla Johnson has built her 
brand on loose printed dresses, in 
this collection her outerwear and 
tailored pants shone brightest, 
particularly her shearling jackets, 
which were a reoccurring motif 
in the collection, appearing in 
several different colors, styles, and 
lengths, the most impressive being 
the one draped over the shoulders 
of the inaugural look. Paired 
with impeccably tailored cream 
trousers, which were detailed 
with two rows of gold buttons and 
attached suspenders, the outfit 
declared that the forthcoming 
collection was not one to be 
ignored. Overall, it was a forceful 
debut, one which will foster a new 
era of success for Johnson.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 
When the new music 

video for Michael Bublé’s “I 
Believe in You” opens with 
two kids shyly watching one 
another from a distance, it 
isn’t hard to try to predict 
where the plot might go 
from there. The narrative of 
a young boy and girl grow-
ing up alongside one another 
and falling in love isn’t new, 
requiring the video to go 
beyond the plotline in order to 
be really appealing.
 
And, in many 

respects, it did. The first 
transition features the boy 
jumping down from a tree and 
landing as a teenager, which 
sets up a pattern of smoothly 
shot transitions that continues 
for the rest of the video. He 
and the girl are shown doing 
innocuous childhood activi-
ties together — riding a bicy-
cle, doing homework — before 
leaning in for what is presum-
ably their first kiss, which 
then cuts to a shot of him car-
rying her over their threshold 
in a wedding dress.
 
In every age period, 

there is a gesture involving 
flowers. The young boy gives 
the girl a yellow flower in 

their backyard; as teenagers, 
he gives her a pink flower as 
they are about to kiss; as new-
lyweds, she holds a similarly 
pink flower over her head as 
he carries her. By the end of 
the video, several years have 
passed, and the man and the 
woman have grown old, their 
mantle filled up with memo-
ries of their lives with their 
children and grandchildren. 

The now-elderly man gives 
his wife a box, and she opens 
it to find flowers, reminding 
us of all of his gestures of love 
toward her over the course of 
their lives.
 
“I Believe in You” is 

a lively song at times, and the 
video echoes this, primarily 
with the terrific dancing skills 
of the actors. Derek Hough 
of “Dancing With the Stars” 
directed and choreographed 
the video, and in his starring 
role as the husband, he brings 
a life and an energy to the 

video that dramatically spikes 
the emotional investment of 
the viewer. He slides down 
tables, jumps over the banister 
of the house’s staircase, and 
embraces his wife, and all of 
these come across as effort-
less expressions of love. Com-
bined with the use of flushed, 
spring-reminiscent colors and 
the emphasis on flowers, it is 
easy to see how this dancing 
would appeal to people at a 
time when a film like “La La 
Land” is so popular.
 
The video ends with 

a quick return to the main 
characters smiling at one 
another as kids, a cliché but 
reasonable decision meant to 
remind the audience of how 
far they’ve come since the 
beginning of the song. The boy 
and the girl aren’t particularly 
unique or memorable, nor is 
the plotline at all inventive 
or something we haven’t seen 
before. But with the help of 
some uplifting music and 
Hough’s choreography skills, 
the video for the most part 
succeeds in packing the emo-
tional punch that it set out for.

New Oscar shorts vibrant

Some of the most (tragically) 

overlooked categories in film are 
those of the short film. This year’s 
crop of Oscar contenders for the 
Live Action Short category prove 
feature-length films aren’t the 
only way to make movies. From 
dance comedies to immigration 
dramas, the one 
thing all five films 
have in common is 
that none of them 
are 
in 
English. 

Seen together, they 
paint 
a 
diverse 

picture 
of 
life 

across the European continent. 

“Mindenki 
(Sing)” 
— 

Hungary — 25 minutes

The shorts begin on a high note 

with Kristóf Deák’s endearing 
“Sing.” One of the best portrayals 
of adolescent girlhood this year, 
the short centers on an award-
winning school choir that boasts 
inclusivity and only half practices 
it. The plot sets up an expected, 
though not unappreciated ending. 
But what really solidifies the short 
is the performance of the young 
lead, Dorka Gáspárfalvi. There’s a 
scene early on in which she sings, 
barely above a whisper, alone to 
herself. She looks in the mirror 
at the way her mouth moves, her 
voice so light it comes in and out of 
audibility. That moment and much 
of the rest of the film are some of 

the most genuine portrayals of 
youth in film this year.

“Silent Nights” — Denmark — 

30 minutes

Often, short films feel like 

pitches for longer movies. Such 
is the case with “Silent Nights,” 
a film from Danish director 
Aske Bang. A young woman 
working at the Salvation Army 
begins a relationship with a 
homeless Ghanaian immigrant 

who comes to the 
shelter. 
“Silent 

Nights” packs an 
emotional punch, 
but ultimately tries 
to tackle too much 
— love, addiction, 
death, 
racism, 

pregnancy — for its half-hour 
runtime. The film oozes potential 
and, given a feature length and a 
better script, it could be incredibly 
impactful.

“El corredor (Timecode)” — 

Spain — 15 minutes

Unlike its peers, “Timecode” 

is something wholly unexpected. 
Purely sweet and surprising, it 
doesn’t comment on the state 
of the world except to say that 
everyone is looking for a way to 
be happy. The fifteen-minute film, 
by far the shortest of the selection, 
follows 
two 
security 
guards 

working in a parking garage as 
they find ways to pass time and 
communicate across shifts. To 
say anything more about the 
plot would do a disservice to the 
surprise Juanjo Giménez has 

expertly crafted.

“Ennemis 
intérieurs 

(Enemies Within)” — France — 
27 minutes

The strongest of the lineup 

is 
also 
the 
most 
topical. 

French director Sélim Azazzi’s 
immigration drama is set in the 
’90s, following a French-Algerian 
seeking 
French 
citizenship 

during the Algerian Civil War, but 
it could be set today. “Ennemis 
intérieurs” shines a harsh light 
on the sort of broad-brush blame 
and 
Islamophobia-inflected 

immigration policy across the 
Western world. The best-acted of 
the contenders, the short is also 
the most heart wrenching, asking 
its audience to take a look at what 
the threat to the nation really is.

“La Femme et le TGV (The 

Railroad Lady)” — Switzerland 
— 30 minutes

The brightest and ultimately 

weakest of the lineup comes from 
Swiss director Timo Van Guten. 
Jane Birkin (yes, Jane Birkin) 
plays a lonely woman who, after 
years of waving to the TGV train 
that passes by her home, develops 
an epistolary relationship with 
the driver. A social recluse who 
passionately lives in the past, most 
of her problems are self-inflicted. 
The plot plays out expectedly, 
giving Birkin plenty — probably 
too many — of opportunities 
to flux between perplexed and 
borderline senile. It’s cute and 
almost quirky, and not much 
more.

Lupe’s latest evades praise

Lupe Fiasco peaked too early, 

and he knows it. In his own 
review of his own album, posted 
on Twitter, he asks what more 
there is to prove, and he has a 
point. His discography paints 
a complicated picture; Food & 
Liquor (2006) broke barriers 
for 
a 
debut 

album, 
mixing 

unprecedented 
sonic 
instrumentation 
with 
uniquely 

pointed 
preaching. The Cool (2007) 
brought 
with 
it 
just 
the 

right amount of aggression, 
maintaining trademark Lupe 
swerve while still harping on 
the same type of local worry 
with which he grew up. And 
then shit went down. Lasers 
(2011), the product of a long 
miscommunication 
between 

Lupe and Atlantic Records, 
was watered down and mostly 
ingenuine, devoid of the soulful 
swagger to which we had 
become accustomed.

Tetsuo & Youth (2015) left 

plenty for us to decode, most of 
which we couldn’t, which was 
perfectly fine. The intellectual 
puzzle revived Lupe’s career 
after his lowest low (2012’s Food 
& Liquor II), and reaffirmed his 
seemingly limitless capacity for 
lyrical development.

It’s 
not 
rocket 
science; 

there legitimately isn’t much 
left to prove. Enter DROGAS 
Light, a release that is, quite 
literally, light on everything: 
substantiality, implication and 
even innovation. It is a light 
version of his better self, a 
diverse compilation of mostly 
bubbly throwaways that are 
more suited for a concert 
setting than a Rap Genius 
seminar. It may not be the Lupe 
we want, but it’s one with which 
we should probably become 
comfortable at this point.

It’s evident as early as the 

second track. If “NGL” is meant 
to be a political statement, 
it’s outdone in substance by 
earlier Lupe, and outdated in 
sound by, well, 2017. A Ty Dolla 
$ign feature can’t save what 
sounds like off-brand Lupe. 
Seemingly one quip away from 
having a much-needed bite, 
that informed aggression never 
comes, instead proving that 

Lupe has settled 
for this. He knows, 
and we know, that 
he is, and has done, 
better. 

“Jump” 
is 
a 

brighter 
note, 

his trademark flow on full 
display 
over 
pulsing 
and 

shifty production. Recklessly 
assertive, it brings with it a 
palpable punch. The substance 
of the song lends itself to the 
smorgasbord of worry (e.g. 
material 
obsession, 
Black 

plight, 
familial 
strength, 

sexual intimacy) Lupe explores 
throughout the album, all nods, 
undoubtedly, to his legacy. It 
becomes clear that he wants to 
be remembered as someone who 
cared. We hear this in “High,” 
which boasts a futuristic sound 
draped in layers of pitchy 
background accompaniment as 
he pleads to be sent to the rap 
heavens.

“Kill” 
is 
Kendrick-esque 

in its effortless cool, which is 
ironic to even claim, as Lupe 
arguably laid the foundation for 
Lamar’s later adapted mastery 
of a vibe-infused political flex. 
Borrowing linguistically from 
To Pimp a Butterfly’s “These 
Walls,” Fiasco shifts thematic 
focus from Lamar — “My n---a, 
if these poles could talk / If the 
stage grew another pole, got up 
and walked / Gotta kill these 
dollars, it can’t be an assault 
/ Need your real love, mama, 
you can’t be in my thoughts” 
— but hits with the sort of 
emotionally-charged 
appeal 

that made us fall in love with 
him in the first place. Reasoning 

with 
the 
seemingly 
more 

ignorant public about women’s 
worth in society (uniquely, in 
this case, through the lens of 
a stripper) is the danger with 
which Lupe should probably 
still be flirting, because he’s 
proven over the course of 
his career that he’s able to 
effectively do so. A provocative 
hook with Ty Dolla $ign and 
Victoria Monét cements the 
track as the album’s best.

A relatively strong initial 

push can’t hide what feels 
like a somewhat half-hearted 
final stretch. “Law” plays as 
a cheap attempt at intimacy; 
“Pick up the Phone” fragments 
itself with an annoying hook; 
“It’s Not Design” showcases 
Lupe’s 
lyrical 
versatility 

and even creativity (“And in 
the futuristic / Love will be 
reduced to physics / Computer 
digits made by robots / That use 
statistics, algorithms, and group 
logistics”), albeit alongside out 
of place production, the same 
issue that plagues “Wild Child” 
one track later. The sincerity 
of “More Than My Heart” 
manages to salvage some of the 
back end’s lost momentum.

Regardless of album-wide 

fluidity 
(or 
lack 
thereof), 

DROGAS 
Light 
cannot 
be 

listened to pretentiously nor 
contextually. 
It 
becomes 

apparent fairly quickly that 
it’s not a release singularly 
intended 
to 
enlighten. 

Compartmentalization 
is 

vital in its listening approach; 
consciously dense Lupe is rarely 
in appearance, and deliberately 
so, eschewed in favor of a 
more carefree aura. After all, 
this Lupe 2.0 (better yet, Lupe 
Light) is all that’s left, and for 
good reason. His legendary 
record speaks for itself. He said 
it best himself when he claimed 
this release as being Lasers, 
refined. Well, Lasers was kind 
of trash, and while DROGAS 
Light deserves more credit than 
trash, it’s certainly nowhere 
close to gold.

ComCo’s ‘PMS’ brilliant

Describing 
ComCo, 
the 

University’s oldest student-run 
improv comedy troupe, is an 
impossible task. In three words, 
I’d say: brilliant, 
effulgent 
and 

wacky. As one of 
the undergraduate 
community’s 
favorite 
groups 

on campus, I had 
high expectations 
for ComCo before 
I saw it for the first 
time in September.

When 
Quinn 

O’Connor — a freshman and new 
member — stood up with a straight 
face and said, “I like my man like I 
like my hat: Sitting on my face,” I 
knew I was in the right place. The 
group is currently comprised of 
nine inimitable and contrasting 
members, 
freshman 
through 

senior, who fit together perfectly 
to create this eclectic and quirky 
group.

“I’m in a group with eight 

amazing other people who are 

all so different in what they are 
studying, where they are from, 
and their interests,” O’Connor 
said. 

ComCo shows are a popular, 

once-a-month Friday night event 
in Angell hall. They are always 
packed with friends, fans and 

students who come 
anticipating 
an 

hour-and-a-half of 
hilarious 
improv 

comedy. Many of 
ComCo’s 
shows 

attract over 300 
audience members, 
some of whom are 
willing to sit in 
the aisles if there 
are no seats left 

(something I’ll admit to doing). 
The community that ComCo has 
built at the University, has given 
students an outlet to laugh, be silly, 
have fun and separate themselves 
from 
the 
stressful 
academic 

world in which they spend their 
everyday lives.

The ComCo players never miss 

a beat during a show, getting 
laughs with every bit they play. 
They 
work 
impeccably 
well 

together given the quick speed and 

impromptu nature of the scenes. 
In speaking with members of the 
group, and seeing them perform 
together, it is clear that the key 
to the popularity of ComCo is 
the 
connection 
between 
the 

members. They are undoubtedly 
comfortable with one another and 
have a strong familial bond off the 
stage.

“Overall, ComCo has shown 

me unconditional love (take that, 
mom and dad), taught me how 
to accept others for who they 
are, and how to turn stairs into a 
sexual object,” added freshman 
Zoe Moore.

In a time when negativity 

and antagonism surround us, it 
is important to find an outlet or 
an escape. ComCo is a space that 
keeps the audience laughing non-
stop from the minute they walk 
in the door. That feel-good, belly-
laughing, brings-tears-to-the eyes 
kind of performance that ComCo 
delivers time and time again is just 
the kind of art we all need to be 
going to see.

‘M’ looks to respond in ACC/Big Ten Challenge

The last time the Michigan 

softball team entered the second 
weekend of its season with 
multiple losses was 2006. 

But after dropping two close 

games in Tampa, Fla. last weekend, 
the Wolverines fell from No. 6 to 
No. 11 in the national rankings and 
now find themselves in uncharted 
waters heading into the ACC/Big 
Ten Challenge this weekend in 
Raleigh, N.C.

Still, 
the 
calendar 
reads 

February, and for Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins and her team, that 
means prioritizing progress over 
results. For one of the longest-
tenured coaches in college softball, 
a couple of opening-weekend 
losses hardly phase her.

What does concern Hutchins, 

though — which she emphasized 
this week in practice — is 
consistency 
throughout 
her 

lineup, particularly with runners 
in scoring position.

Last weekend, the Wolverines 

hit .314 as a team, but managed an 
average below .200 with runners 
in scoring position. There are 

several potential explanations for 
that disparity, both physically and 
mentally.

“A lot of it was our mindset,” said 

senior shortstop Abby Ramirez. 
“We didn’t get the timely hits we 
needed, so we’ve been working 
on hitting with runners in scoring 
position and not making it too big 
of a deal in your head. Just taking 
it as a normal at-bat.”

That struggle may also be a 

product of the lack of experience. 
Entering last weekend, only five 
players on the roster had earned 
over 100 at-bats in their careers. 

Sophomores 
Natalie 
Peters, 

Courtney 
Richardson, 
Alex 

Sobczak and Faith Canfield — all 
expected to be major contributors 
on offense this season — entered 
the season with a combined total 
of 182 at-bats in their careers, with 
most coming in blowouts, pinch-
hit appearances or other lower-
leverage sitations. For context, 
senior outfielder Kelly Christner 
had nearly that many (179) on her 
own last season.

“We spent most of yesterday 

free-swinging, working on drills 
that help untie us. We’re a little 
tied-up, a little tight,” Hutchins 

said. “And they look like they’re 
swinging a little better, but 
obviously we’ll see this weekend.”

Granted, this weekend will not 

mount the same type of challenge 
to the young lineup that now-No. 
1 Florida was able to provide last 
weekend.

Michigan will go up against 

NC State and Notre Dame — each 
twice — in this year’s ACC/Big 
Ten Challenge. The Wolfpack 
and Fighting Irish went 2-3 and 
3-2, respectively, in their opening 
weekend tournaments.

These two games will be just 

the fifth and sixth matchups all-
time between Michigan and NC 
State — the Wolverines have won 
all four of their previous contests. 
If Michigan can focus on keeping 
the ball in the ballpark, it should 
have a good chance to take both 
games against the Wolfpack. 
Last season, NC State finished 
11th in the country in home 
runs per game (1.29), despite 
managing just the 179th best 
batting average in the country 
(.270 average). 

Notre Dame, on the other hand, 

is a more well-known opponent.

“I know we’ll have our hands 

full (with the Fighting Irish),” 
Hutchins said in an interview with 
WTKA on Thursday. “We always 
have great competitive matchups 
with Notre Dame, they’re a very 
familiar team, as we see them 
often in our postseason.” 

Most 
recently, 
Michigan 

topped the Fighting Irish last 
May, 6-2, to advance to the NCAA 
Super Regionals. That day, then-
junior right-hander Megan Betsa 
neutralized 
the 
Notre 
Dame 

lineup, limiting it to just two runs 
in a complete-game performance. 

Most notably, though, Betsa 

did not walk a batter and threw 
just 93 pitches. While she has 
been outspoken about wanting to 
pitch to contact more this season, 
Betsa threw over 300 pitches and 
walked 10 batters in 17 innings last 
weekend. 

Though she was named Big 

Ten Pitcher of the Week for the 
dominance — to her credit, the 
0.41 earned-run average and 27 
strikeouts speak for themselves — 
Hutchins knows that in order to 
maximize the number of innings 
Betsa can throw this season while 
still maintaining her health for a 
postseason run, Betsa will have to 
be more efficient.

“It’s not lost on her that the 

more pitches she throws in a 
game, the less available she’s going 
to be,” Hutchins said. “We’re 
very cognizant of (her workload). 
She just needs to attack hitters. 
You don’t pitch to not get hit, you 
pitch to beat them, and she’s very 
capable of that.”

While the theme of the week 

was improving the consistency 
of the offense, perhaps the most 
important aspect to watch this 
weekend will be the pitching staff. 
If Betsa and junior right-hander 
Tera Blanco can be more efficient 
and effective in their outings, that 
could bode well not only for this 
weekend, but for the rest of the 
season.

The calendar may read February 

— and for Betsa the results may 
continue to be good — but it’s those 
types of gradual improvements 
that may be beneficial come May.

Michigan falls to Indiana

At 
halftime, 
the 
No. 
20 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team appeared dead in the water. 
Michigan 
trailed 
Indiana 
40-22 — its 
lowest point total this season — 
while shooting just 12.5 percent 
from 3-point range. The Hoosiers 
looked to be running away with 
the contest.

But the Wolverines managed 

to fight back in the second half. 
Michigan went on an 11-0 run in 
the fourth quarter and trimmed 
the deficit to just eight points. 
It wasn’t enough, though, as 
Indiana held on for a 72-61 win. 
The Wolverines made just 21.3 
percent of their three-point shots 
in the game. 

“Coming into tonight, we 

needed to remind ourselves that 
Indiana is a good team,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “They’re a team that’s 
experienced and a team that 
plays well at home. It just felt like 
anything we were throwing at 
them, they were scoring on.”

With 7:31 to go in the fourth 

frame, Michigan (10-3 Big Ten, 
21-6 overall) found itself in a 
65-46 hole until freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick made her first 
3-pointer of the night. Junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty and 
freshman forward Kayla Robbins 
followed Gondrezick up with a 
pair of layups before Gondrezick 
made a two-point jumper. The 
comeback effort was on for 
Michigan.

Reality then set in for the 

Wolverines, as Hoosier guard 
Tyra Buss made a layup with 
2:18 to go that put Indiana (8-5, 
18-8) ahead by double-digits once 
again. The Wolverines never 
recovered from the 68-57 deficit, 
as they scored only once in their 
final four possessions.

“We had a legitimate shot 

in the fourth quarter,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Then we kind of got 

stagnant. We got some stops, but 
we weren’t able to get scores. 
We haven’t lost in a long time. 
It’ll be interesting to see how we 
respond.”

Most 
of 
the 
game 
was 

dominated 
by 
the 
Hoosiers, 

especially the first quarter.

Indiana outscored Michigan 

13-0 over the last six minutes of 
the first frame, which allowed the 
Hoosiers to take a 23-8 lead. Buss 
led the charge for Indiana, scoring 
nine points. The Wolverines, 
meanwhile, made just three of 
their 11 shots in the quarter.

Michigan continued to implode 

in the second stanza, as the 
Hoosiers rode an 8-0 run to their 
40-22 halftime lead. This time, it 
was guard Karlee McBride who 
abused the Wolverines, putting 
up seven points in the frame. 
Michigan further hindered its 
cause by turning the ball over six 
times while Indiana coughed it 
up just thrice.

“We couldn’t get stops early 

on, and I think that frustrated 
us,” Barnes Arico said. “I think 
that forced us to take some bad 
looks on (the) offensive end.”

Life was marginally easier 

for the Wolverines in the third 
quarter, as they made 53.3 
percent of their shots. Michigan 
even managed a 6-0 run thanks 
to 
back-to-back 
3-pointers 

from sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger and senior guard Siera 
Thompson.

But it was nowhere near 

enough to erase the Wolverines’ 
deficit. The Hoosiers shot 56.3 
percent and commanded a 61-42 
edge at the end of the third. The 
hole proved to be too much for 
Michigan to crawl out of. 

Despite 
the 
defeat, 
the 

Wolverines remain two games 
ahead of Indiana for third place 
in the Big Ten standings. They 
can clinch the third seed in the 
Big Ten Tournament with a win 
over Michigan State on Sunday, 
but after falling to the Hoosiers 
on Thursday, they will also need 
an Indiana loss to achieve their 
season-long goal.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan set for tough 
series with Wisconsin

The last time the Michigan 

hockey team played on an 
Olympic-sized rink, it struggled 
defensively, allowing nine goals 
in two games to Minnesota.

Since then, the Wolverines’ 

defense has continued to be 
a trouble spot, giving up two 
goals or fewer in only one of six 
games since playing the Golden 
Gophers.

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 

will face another offensive-
minded team on a larger sheet 
of ice when it takes on No. 20 
Wisconsin.

The 
Badgers 
boast 
the 

seventh-best offense in the 
country 
and 
showed 
their 

ability to score goals in their first 
game against the Wolverines, 
exploding for seven goals.

Though the larger ice rink 

can sometimes pose a challenge 
for opposing defenses, Michigan 
knows what it has to improve 
upon to be ready for Wisconsin.

“I think the forecheck is 

going to be really important,” 
said senior defenseman Nolan 
De Jong. “Because the faster 
we can take away their time 
and space in the offensive zone, 
obviously the less we’ll have it 
in our zone.

“For the defense, kind of 

staying between the (faceoff) 
dots. You see these teams, 
they’ll try to spread you outside 
the dots and try to find that lane 
to the middle. Wisconsin’s a 
team that’s going to try to sneak 
guys behind you and try to 
score on breakaways and kind 
of quick, fast transitions.”

Offensively, the Wolverines 

seemed to be improving, but 
they 
struggled 
again 
last 

Saturday 
against 
Michigan 

State. Though senior forward 
Alex Kile remains sidelined 
with an injury, Michigan hopes 
to show its offensive potency on 
the larger ice.

One reason for optimism 

could be freshman forward 
Will Lockwood. His scoring has 

slowed down after a hot start 
to the season, but with more 
room to skate this weekend, the 
freshman’s speed and offensive 
ability could be on display. He 
was unable to make the trip to 
Minneapolis due to an injury of 
his own, so this will be the first 
time he has an opportunity to 
make an impact for Michigan 
with extra space on the ice.

According 
to 
Michigan 

coach Red Berenson, his team’s 
competitiveness 
and 
puck 

security will be key.

“We didn’t have all of our 

speed in the lineup (against 
Minnesota),” 
Berenson 
said. 

“This is a skater’s rink, but 
you still have got to compete. 
Wisconsin’s a skilled team, and 
they skate. They’re one of the 
better offensive teams in our 
league, especially on the power 
play.

“But we’ve got to take care 

of the puck. That’s one thing 
I thought we did poorly on 
Saturday at home. We got the 
puck, and then we’d turn it 
over, and then we’d be chasing 
it again. And in a rink like this, 
you’re going to be chasing all 
night if you don’t take care of 
the puck.”

In net, the Wolverines will 

turn to freshman goaltender 
Jack LaFontaine. After not 
playing much in the middle of 
the season, LaFontaine started 
Saturday against the Spartans 
and started strong before an 
injury forced him to leave the 
game early.

Michigan 
is 
heading 
to 

Madison in the midst of a rather 
rough stretch, losing five of 
its last eight games. But the 
Wolverines are still optimistic, 
according to De Jong.

“I think we’re pretty upbeat 

right now,” De Jong said. “I 
think we know we got a bit of a 
wakeup call last Saturday. That 
wasn’t an acceptable effort. But 
I think we had a really good 
practice out there today, and I 
think we’re excited to go and 
excited to get another game 
under our belt.”

Wolverines to open season against Seton Hall 

With so much of the same 

personnel returning for the 
Michigan 
baseball 
team, 
it 

seems fitting that its 2017 
season will begin in the same 
place the 2016 campaign did.

The Wolverines, who were 

recently picked to finish second 
behind Maryland in the Big Ten 
Preseason Coaches Poll, will 
take on Seton Hall in a four-
game series in Port St. Lucie, 
Fla. beginning on Friday. The 
trip marks the ninth time in 10 
years that Michigan has played 
in Port St. Lucie, the spring 
training home of the New York 
Mets.

Michigan was ranked 15th 

in the country at the start of 
last season, and justified that 
placement 
with 
a 
season-

opening 
four-game 
sweep 

of Canisius in Florida. The 
Wolverines 
will 
begin 
this 

season unranked, however, due 
to the loss of key contributors, 
such as utility player Carmen 
Benedetti 
and 
left-handed 

pitcher Brett Adcock, as well as 
their struggles down the stretch 
last season. After a 34-12 start, 
they lost nine of their final 
11 games and failed to reach 
the NCAA Tournament. Still, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich’s 
expectations for his veteran-
laden squad remain high.

“(This 
team 
has) 
been 

training as hard and with 
as much intent as possible,” 
Bakich said. “There’s as much 
anticipation for this particular 
group as any team I’ve been a 
part of.”

For the pitching staff, junior 

left-hander Oliver Jaskie is 
effectively locked in as the 
Wolverines’ top starter after 
compiling a 7-3 record with a 
3.19 earned-run average last 
season. 
Sophomore 
right-

hander Alec Rennard, a junior 
college transfer from Santa 
Rosa Community College, is 
all but assured of a rotation 
spot as well. Behind them, a 
number of veterans will look to 
assert themselves. Junior right-
hander Ryan Nutof and left-
hander Michael Hendrickson 

are 
currently 
leading 
the 

competiton to fill out the 
rotation.

Michigan’s 
strength 
on 

offense 
centers 
around 
an 

experienced 
and 
versatile 

infield 
that 
returns 
four 

starters, all of whom are capable 
of filling a number of roles if 
necessary. Juniors Jake Bivens 
— a .356 hitter last season — and 
Drew Lugbauer — second on 
the team with seven home runs 
— will man the corner infield 
spots. Senior shortstop Michael 
Brdar and sophomore second 
baseman Ako Thomas, who 
aren’t as prolific at the plate as 
Bivens or Lugbauer, will serve 
as anchors up the middle.

“Brdar and Ako Thomas 

are really skilled defensively,” 
Bivens said. “(Senior catcher 
Harrison Wenson) and Drew 
and 
(sophomore 
infielder 

Jimmy Kerr) can play any 
position, 
so 
obviously 
that 

experience will be important 
for us.”

Added Bakich: “It’s not very 

often you get the entire infield 
back. (Bivens) has played plenty 

of shortstop in his time here 
and even Lugbauer got a little 
time at shortstop last fall. I feel 
very confident about our infield 
talent.”

Accentuating this versatility 

is Wenson, Michigan’s leader 
in home runs and runs batted 
in last season with eight and 
56, respectively. Not only will 
he occupy a spot in the middle 
of the order as the Wolverines‘ 
primary 
power 
source, 
but 

he has proven himself to be 
dependable as a backstop.

“He gives us not only a good 

presence behind the plate, but 
allows us to get our best offense 
on the field,” Bakich said.

Similar to Michigan, Seton 

Hall missed out on an NCAA 
Tournament berth last season 
despite a solid 38-20 record. 
With a lineup anchored by Mike 
Alescio, a preseason All-Big 
East selection at catcher, the 
Pirates will likely implement a 
small-ball approach predicated 
on baserunning and defense. 
Seton Hall hit just 11 home runs 
with a .273 average last season, 
far below the Wolverines’ 28 

home runs and team batting 
average of .299, but the Pirates 
led the nation in stolen bases at 
183.

While Seton Hall may not 

hold an offensive advantage 
over 
the 
Wolverines, 
the 

Pirates do boast an experienced 
pitching staff which posted 
a 3.21 ERA last year. Shane 
McCarthy 
— 
a 
unanimous 

selection to the All-Big East 
first feam — and Cullen Dana 
both recorded sub-3.00 ERAs, 
while closer Zach Schellenger 
struck out 70 batters in just 45.2 
innings.

Despite the bitter end to 

last season, excitement and 
optimism 
around 
Michigan 

baseball remains high, and a 
quality opponent in Seton Hall 
will provide an experienced 
Wolverine squad with their 
first big test in their quest to 
return to the postseason. 

“We have a great group of 

guys that know how to handle 
the pressure,” Bivens said. “It’s 
been exciting to play with them, 
and it’s going to be a great time 
going down South.”

Michigan upsets No. 11 Wisconsin, boosts NCAA tournament resume

Entering Thursday night, it was 

no secret that the Michigan men’s 
basketball team had a shot at the 
upset.

The Wolverines were rolling, 

fresh off a blowout win against 
Michigan State and their first 
victory at Assembly Hall since 
2009. The momentum, coupled 
with the fact that Michigan led 
No. 11 Wisconsin in Madison last 
month until the final five minutes, 
pointed toward the possibility of 
the Wolverines’ first win against a 
ranked opponent this season.

And when it was announced that 

Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig 
would be sidelined for the matchup 
with a left leg strain, that chance 
seemed even more likely.

After all, it marked the first time 

in Koenig’s career that he would miss 
a game for the Badgers due to injury, 

and it was his performance that 
brought Michigan’s upset attempt at 
the Kohl Center to a screeching halt 
— scoring 10 consecutive points late 
to singlehandedly give Wisconsin a 
lead that it wouldn’t relinquish.

But this time, there was no 

wondering, as Michigan closed out 
a resume-bolstering 64-58 victory 
at Crisler Center to beat the Badgers 
for the first time since 2014.

“This team deserves to have a run 

like this,” said sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner. “We’re such a good 
group — everybody loves each other, 
everybody plays for each other. We 
practice so hard, and we’ve been 
going through a stretch where that 
didn’t always pay off. And now it 
pays off, so it just means so much to 
us that we’re able to have a run right 
now and win games against really 
good teams.”

Even in its early stages, the game 

shaped up to be a battle of the big 
men.

Michigan (7-6 Big Ten, 17-9 

overall) opened up the first half on 
an 8-2 run, but the Badgers (10-3 
Big Ten, 21-5 overall) managed to 
cut the deficit quickly and started 
feeding the ball to forward Ethan 
Happ.

Wagner had the responsibility 

of stopping Wisconsin’s redshirt 
freshman, but Happ played the first 
half like a man incapable of being 
stopped.

With 8:29 left in the frame, 

Wagner was called for his first foul 
of the game and was replaced by 
freshman forward Jon Teske. Up to 
that point, Wagner had weathered 
the impending storm, holding Happ 
to just six points.

But Teske’s inexperience showed, 

and Happ took full advantage — 
scoring six straight points while 
Teske could do nothing but commit 
two fouls that ultimately brought 
Wagner back in.

By that time, though, Happ 

had found his groove — taking 
whatever he wanted down low to 
finish the half with 18 points on 
8-for-9 shooting, four assists and 
three rebounds. It was certainly 
a precarious situation for the 
Wolverines, as they had held Happ 
to just 11 total points in their last 
meeting.

Despite struggling to contain 

Wisconsin’s marquee big man, 
Wagner still did his part on the 
other end to keep Michigan afloat 
— scoring a team-high 12 points 
on 4-for-7 shooting. While Happ 
imposed his will in the post, Wagner 
operated beyond the arc, draining 
2-of-4 from deep.

Still, Happ’s dominant half put 

the Badgers on top, 31-30, at the 
break.

The second half, though, was a 

different story. 

While Wisconsin looked poised 

to break the game open with a 
7-0 run to open the frame, the 

Wolverines 
managed 
to 
stick 

around after notching a 6-0 run of 
their own.

“I don’t know if they don’t go up 

eight like that, maybe we don’t win 
the game,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “Maybe it’s nip and 
tuck and we let it get away at the 
end. I think our guys had that ‘back 
to the wall’ again, knowing that we 
were in trouble.

“(Derrick Walton Jr.) in the 

huddle shouted, ‘We’ve got to get 
stops! We’ve got to get stops!’ That’s 
not typical Derrick Walton. … I felt 
a sense of urgency from this team 
once we got down by eight.”

Then, 
roughly 
five 
minutes 

after willing his team forward in 
the huddle, Walton took the ball to 
the hole for an acrobatic layup and 
drew Happ’s third foul. Though it 
sent him to the bench for just over 
a minute, Happ was visibly more 
tentative on the defensive end for 
the remainder of the game.

That — coupled with Michigan’s 

decision to start double teaming 
him on the opposite end — limited 
Happ’s impact, as he fouled out with 
36.9 seconds left to finish with just 
four second-half points and end the 
game with 22 points on 10-for-13 
shooting.

“When to double is always the 

question,” Wagner said. “He’s a 
really good passer, I kind of feel like 
he likes to pass. But that’s the thing, 
you’ve gotta mix it up. You can’t give 
him the same look every possession. 
I think we did a pretty good job of 
that.” 

Entering Thursday night, it was 

no secret that the Wolverines had a 
shot at the upset.

But that doesn’t make stamping a 

win against the Badgers’ onto their 
NCAA Tournament resume any less 
sweet.

Irvin rediscovers form in victory

If calling bank was all it took, Zak 

Irvin would have said it a lot sooner.

With the shot clock approaching 

zero, the senior wing launched a 
prayer. Given Irvin’s recent slump 
over Michigan’s last four games 
entering 
Thursday’s 
tie 
with 

Wisconsin — in which he’s averaged 
3.25 points per game — nobody 
thought Irvin’s heave was going 
anywhere near the twine below the 
rim. 

But Irvin got just enough power 

and accuracy on his shot that a kiss 
off the glass of the backboard was 
enough for it to fall through the 
hoop.

As Irvin turned around, he gave 

off a shrug in disbelief. Who would 
have thought that out of all the shots 
he has missed of late, the one that 
seemed most improbable would 
actually go in?

It turned out that all Irvin needed 

was a trip to the bank to get back to 
his true scoring self in Michigan’s 
64-58 win over the Badgers.

“When I made in that bank shot, 

I was so relieved after it went in,” 
Irvin said. “I think that really got 
me going in the second half. It’s a 
great feeling.“

Irvin knew it was only a matter 

of time before he’d be able to bounce 
back and rediscover his form.

After his four-game streak of 

underwhelming 
performances, 

Irvin put together an impressive 
18-point, five-rebound and three-
assist night that might have been his 
best all-around performance of the 

conference season.

The senior began by diversifying 

his offense, scoring an easy layup 
at the hoop and getting to the free-
throw line early. Irvin’s jump shot 
was still off in the first half, as he 
airballed a three in the opening 
minutes, but he still boosted 
Michigan’s offense by finding easy 
baskets at the hoop.

Michigan coach John Beilein 

trusted that Irvin would breakout 
and become the offensive threat 
he’s been for most of the season. 
The only way Beilein felt that could 
happen was to continue giving Irvin 
the green light.

“When he threw that air ball and 

missed by four feet, I don’t care,” 
Beilein said. “I told him, ‘Shoot it 
when you’re open.’ It’s going to be 
very hard for us to have success this 
year if we shut him off and just say, 
‘Don’t.’ He scored 1,400 points — 
you don’t say, ‘Okay, you don’t know 
how to score anymore.’ You don’t 
forget that.”

While Irvin proved Thursday 

that his jump shot wasn’t close to 
being forgotten, he also showed that 
the slump may have had benefitted 
other facets of his game.

Irvin had two assists down 

low in the second half to redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson and 
sophomore forward Moritz Wagner 
that circumnavigated Wisconsin’s 
stout frontcourt defense and led to 
a couple of big scores in the paint. 
Those were passes Irvin may not 
have made a couple of weeks ago, 
but his vision has opened up to more 
than just the hoop in front of him.

“I think tonight, I was able to find 

players and put them in the right 
position to score,” Irvin said. “I just 
got to do that going forward.”

The senior also put more energy 

into making stops on the defensive 
end. In the second half, Irvin had 
the task of double teaming Badger 
forward Ethan Happ, who had 
tallied 18 points and four assists in 
the first 20 minutes.

The help defense clearly got to 

Happ’s head as the second half 
progressed. Irvin forced Happ into 
bad shots and bad passing lanes, all 
while holding his main defensive 
assignment, Wisconsin forward 
Nigel Hayes, to just four points in 
the final period.

“That’s been the biggest thing 

for me,” Irvin said. “I’m able to 
impact the game in other ways 
than scoring. I’ve really taken it 
upon myself on the defensive end to 
contribute there. As a whole, we did 
a great job on Hayes and Happ.”

With five games to go in the 

regular season, Michigan knows it 
needs Irvin to be his well-rounded 
self now more than ever as it enters 
the home stretch of its postseason 
push.

“That kid works so hard, (and) 

has been going through a tough 
stretch,” Wagner said. “To be 
honest, I think people make a big 
deal out of it even though it isn’t. 
Like people go through stretches 
like that. I’m so happy that — even 
though he banked it, I don’t care 
how — it was such a relief. We just 
knew, hey, he’s back.”
