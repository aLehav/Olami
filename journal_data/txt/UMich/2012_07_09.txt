tributed to will be able to satisfy
the federal requirements for local
match," Kosteva said. "So, yes,
some of the University money that
was spent toward Fuller Road sta-
tion might contribute toward the
federal grant."
Kosteva said the University
acknowledges the Fuller Road loca-
tion as the prime site for the train
station, even if it won't include a
parking station or built-in Univer-
sity bus station that the original
Fuller Road station plan included.
"We believe that it would serve
community and University inter-
ests, and we are likely to be a
partner of some measure at such
a time when the city is able to line
up federal and other local funding
sources for the construction of a
new station," he said.
Because the original Fuller Road
plans fell through, the University
is building a parking structure for
the hospital independently.
Kosteva said the University
couldn't afford to wait for the
potential Fuller Road station park-
ing structure in collaboration with
the city because of the pressing
need for more hospital employee
parking. Part of the need is due to
the openingofC.S. Mott Children's
and Von Voightlander Women's
Hospital creating 500 new jobs.
The tables were turned, how-
ever, when plans for the Wall Street
parkingstructure caused some Ann
Arbor residents and councilmem-
bers to criticize the University.
Though Kosteva emphasized the

necessity ofthe parkingstructure.
"There were expressions Hof
concern from neighbors in the
Wall Street area expressing their
preference not to have a park-
ing structure," Kosteva said. "It
is reasonably close proximity to
the medical center, so it enables
our (medical center) employees to
shuttle or to walk from that loca-
tion. There has also been growth in
employment in the Wall Street area
with the expansion of the Kellogg
Eye Center and the expansion of
the Brehm Tower."
Another factor making the city
budget important to the University
is that the University has money
flowingto the city through streams
like leasing buildings and paying
taxes, according to Kosteva.
Kosteva added that, overall, the
relationship between the city and
the University is strong.
"For the most part, there is an
appreciation and a value that the
University has added 9,000 jobs
in this community in the past 10
years," Kosteva said. "I believe
there is a real, sincere appreciation
for that on the part of the city and
the majority of residents through-
out the community"
However, Kosteva noted
that there is sometimes' friction
between the two parties.
"Nonetheless, there is also an
ever-present tension that does exist
between the University communi-
ty, public universities and the com-
munities that they're in, because
there's such a large amount of
property," Kosteva said.

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
Two new assistant coaches
were named to the Michigan
baseball program staff after much
speculation about who new head
coach Erik Bakich would retain
from his staff at Maryland.
On Thursday, Sean Kenny and
Nick Schnabel were hired as assis-
tants to Bakich, where Kenny will
serve as the pitching coach and
Schnabel will be the recruiting
coordinator.
Kenny is an Ann Arbor native,
having graduated from Pioneer
High School. He was at Maryland
with Bakich for three years as the
pitching coach. The Terrapins had
the third-best ERA in the Atlantic
Coast Conference in 2012-and set'
the program records for strikeouts
(464) in 2010. Kenny also helped
on the recruiting side, bringing in
Maryland's first top-25 recruiting
class in 2010. He also developed
two future MLB draft picks in his
time with the Terrapins.

Kenny has served as a recruit-
ing coordinator and pitching
coach at numerous other univer-
sities, and played baseball both
at the collegiate and professional
level, with Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity and the New York Mets,
respectively..
Schnabel comes to Michigan
after spending three years at East
Carolina as the hitting coach and
recruiting coordinator. He had
much success recruiting, garner-
ing nationally ranked recruiting
classes in addition to developing
talent to send to the next level.
Schnabel played ball with
Bakich at East Carolina, where
Schnabel was named Defensive
.Player of the Year in 1999 by the
Colonial Athletic Association.
"Sean and Nick are among the
best in the nation at what they
do," Bakich said in a statement
released by the athletic 'depart-
ment. "We are fortunate to have
them join our staff and help lead
Michigan baseball back to a cham-
pionship level."

Masters added that The

"They have three times the
traffic we do, so a lot of people
who haven't heard of us are going
to check us out and start using us,
and to some degree there will be
cross-linking between the two,"
Master said.
Masters said in addition to The
Weather Channel's video prow-
ess, the partnership will allow the
possibility of utilizing their large
Twitter following.
"Certainly we could use their
density of Twitter people that
send weather information via
Twitter to do some cool projects
where you could check out in real
time when there's a major weath-
er activity happening and sort of
look at the Twitter activity going
on," Masters said.



Cardiovascular Center - said
moving IHPI researchers into
the NCRC will allow a world of
collaboration among the sciences
that will benefit health care
research.
"When we bring those kinds
of investigative teams together
in a common place and create
opportunities for education
... sometimes great things can
happen," Eagle said. "Certainly for
training programs, having groups
of investigators in a common place
creates opportunities for cross
fertilization."
Eagle said the center offers an
unprecedented opportunity for
the University.
"This moment really creates
a new opportunity for us to do
something quite wonderful,"
Eagle said. "Measure quality
better, maximize safety (and)
improve the ability to inform
patients and families about the
best care."
Eagle said the institute plans
to bring great minds together to
make lasting changes.
"I feel very optimistic that
these new bridges in health care
research are going to be fostered
by this new institute," Eagle
said. "U of M wants to be an
international university, wants
to be considered as a place that is
helping with thoughts on how we
organize and deliver healthcare.
This institute has potential to take

that to a new level in a critical
moment in our nation's healthcare
history."
Eagle said the center will
work with other organizations to
improve health care around Mich-
igan.
"It's entirely likely that the
University will be proactive with
working with other institutions in
the state as a voice to try to help
maximize the provision of preven-
tive health and health care deliv-
ery throughout the state," Eagle
said.
Last week, the first 80 IHPI
researchers and staff were moved
to the new building, and in the
upcoming months, the more
than 400 more who are on their
way will make this "the largest
university-based health services
research institute in the country,"
by the end of the summer, accord-
ing to Dr. Rodney Hayward, pro-
fessor of internal medicine, health
management and policy and chair
of the interim leadership team of
the IHPI.
"Some of our work will be
unchanged," Hayward said.
"There's alot ofgreat work already
coming, but the greatest changes
in the work are people working
across these disciplines, not just
to bring together different parts of
the university, but to bring togeth-
er partnerships nationally and in
region and state."

A minimal minimum
Congress should support millions of underpaid workers
n Wednesday, U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young (R-Fla.) told a young
constituent to "get a job" after he voiced his opinion in support
of a federal bill that would increase the federal minimum wage
to $10 an hour. The constituent responded that he did have a job, one
that pays $8.50 an hour. Young did not seem to understand or care. This
example is just one of many that illuminates the unnecessary partisan
undertones in discussions regarding this issue. An increase in the federal
minimum wage provides an uncommon opportunity for both parties to
come together on a seemingly non-partisan issue, yet this bill is unlikely
to pass in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats and Republicans
alike must come together to pass the "Catching Up To 1968 Act of 2012"
in order to support millions of underpaid workers in the U.S.

PAKISTAN -. We Pakistanis
seem to enjoy blaming others for
our problems. In a country crum-
bling under the weight of the
consequences of its own actions,
populist rhetoric continues to
point fingers in various directions.
Distributing blame for Pakistan's
failures on external actors is the
convenient and safe option, but
Pakistan will continue to suffer as
long as we don't learn to confront
our problems, accept them as our
own and try to mend relations
with the rest of the world.
Since I returned to Pakistan,
relations with the United States
have reached their lowest point.
The U.S. is fed up with dealing
with the incumbent Pakistani gov-
ernment. As a result of the Salala
incident - in which a U.S. aircraft
gunned down 24 Pakistani sol-
diers at the Salala check post at
the Pak-Afghan border - the
Pakistani authorities shut down
NATO supply routes to Afghani-
stan, refusing to open the vital
route to Afghanistan without an
apology from Washington. After
months of deadlock, the U.S. has
finally decided to say "sorry" for
the incident. Pakistan has agreed
to contribute to negotiations to
reopen the NATO supply route in
return.
Another case of Pakistani fin-
ger-pointing and misplaced pride
is in the cards. Every politician
in Pakistan knew that closing the
NATO supply route was detrimen-
tal for Pakistan. Because of poor
relations, halted aid payments
and Pakistan's mounting debt, the
U.S. dollar is expected to hit 100
rupees by July, which is torture
to the already-starved Pakistani
economy. To make matters worse,
Pakistan decided to sentence the
doctor who gave intelligence to
the U.S. about Osama bin Laden's
whereabouts. Dr. Shakil Afridi
was tried through a draconian
legal system in Pakistan's mostly
lawless Federally Administered
Tribal Area. Few Pakistanis
accept the credibility of the Jirga
system, so it would be asking too
much of the international commu-
nity to accept the sentence.

The incumbent Pakistan Peo-
ple's Party government needs to
do what is best for the country and
not what is best for its own image.
Restarting negotiations with the
U.S. was necessary, and now the
PPP needs to work on repairing the
resulting damage. But the light at
the end of the tunnel looks dim. As
Washington applies pressure from
the top, Islamabad fails to react as
political disarray has plagued the
capital city. The PPP government
has proven that it isn't concerned
with the well-being of the coun-
try. The first prime minister under
this government was disqualified
because he acted against the order
of the Supreme Court and refused
to send a letter to Swiss authorities
to open corruption cases against
the president of Pakistan for money
laundering. When the time came to
elect a new prime minister, a war-
rant went out against the PPP's
first choice candidate for involve-
ment in a drug scandal while he
was the health minister. The PPP's
second choice candidate and cur-
rent Prime Minister Raja Pervez
Ashraf was once the water and
power minister in a country that
doesn't receive much of those two
utilities. A man who wasn't com-
petent enough to run a ministry is
now expected to hold the reins of a
country stumbling into a domestic
and international crisis.
Of Pakistan's total budget of
2.96 trillion rupees, 926 billion
rupees will be spent on servicing
debt. About a third of the budget
is being spent on simply servic-
ing debt, yet the sum of 926 billion
rupees is hardly a drop in the buck-
et of Pakistan's overall debt. The
PPP needs to get something right.
After relentless warnings from
Washington that its patience was
running low, some progress has
finally been made. It would be best
not to upset our allies and do what
we can to rebuild our relationship
with the U.S. As the PPP struggles
to drag its battered carriage eight
months further across the finish
line, we can only hope they don't
continue to drag the rest of the
country on the ground behind it.

No novel concepts in
'To Rome with Love',
doesn't leave a mark
By JACOB AXELRAD
Editor in Chief
There's a scene toward the end
of "To Rome with Love" where
Woody Allen's Jerry lectures
his wife Phyl-
lis (Judy Davis,
"The Break-Up")
to refrain from
assessing his TO RIe
behavior, say- with Lmoe
ing, "Don't psy- At Qu 16
choanalyze me! A ty
Many have tried. andRata
All have failed."
Yet if one were
to analyze him,
he or she might ask Allen why he
feels compelled to crank out a dif-
ferent movie every year. Why he
doesn't simply take a brief hiatus,
play some clarinet and write a
script that reads like a few others
had a hand in it instead of looking
like the first ideas he put to paper.
When we first meet Allen-
as-Jerry on-board a plane from
Rome to New York, clutching the
armrests out of fear, the feeling

is akin to meeting an old friend,
someone you're glad to see regard-
less of the circumstances. He
complains about the turbulence.
He expresses fears of death. He
bickers with his spouse. It's classic
Woody, and the audience's laugh-
ter says it all: This is a character
we enjoy spending time with. But
Allen's onscreen persona is quite
different from the man behind the
camera. And the latter, who's also
the writer, has made a film that,
though at times charming, lacks
cohesiveness.
Set in Rome, Allen's latest film
presents numerous independent
storylines that explore the mys-
tery, glamour and seduction of
the "Eternal City." Jerry, a retired
opera director, and his wife Phyllis
are travelling to meet their daugh-
ter Hayley (Alison Pill, "Scott Pil-
grim vs. the World") and her new
Italian fiancee Michelangelo (Fla-
vio Parenti, "I Am Love") whom
she met while spending the sum-
mer in Italy. As the young lovers'
families get to know one another,
Jerry learns that Michelangelo's
undertaker father Giancarlo (real-
life tenor Fabio Armiliato) is an
amazingly talented opera singer
- except he can only sing in the
shower. In an attempt to emerge
from retirement Jerry persuades

a reluctant Giancarlo to share his
talent with the musical world.
Meanwhile, John, (Alec Bald-
win, "Rock of Ages") a successful
architect on vacation, is reminded
of a conflicted past when he cross-
es paths with Jack (Jesse Eisen-
berg, "The Social Network"), an
architecture student living with
his girlfriend Sally (Greta Ger-
wig, "Arthur") and her seductive
actress friend Monica (Ellen Page,
"Inception"). Other storylines
include Roberto Benigni ("Life is
Beautiful") as a befuddled simple-
ton, who inexplicably steps out
his front door one day only to be
mobbed by the paparazzi as one of
the most famous men in Rome.
The plots don't overlap and the 'I'm in love with...'
time frames for the different nar-
ratives range from a single day to conversations about life and love
several weeks. Of course, these - it's not always a guarantee for
aren't requirements, but they do success. In fact, sometimes it can

wit, stating maxims such as celeb-
rity is preferable to layperson and
life trumps death, they feel forced,
not like they're emerging from the
story, but rather from the creator
himself.
There's nothing wrong with
profound messages or a script
with parallel parts in its structure.
Except this time around that's
pretty much all there is: a struc-
ture, a skeleton with little sub-
stance to flesh it out. What might
have been a decent movie from
someone else doesn't make the
cut when it's a part of the Woody
Allen cannon. We expect more
from the most recent winner of
the best original screenplay Oscar.
We expect the stuff that makes
us quote the movie to friends for
years to come. Allen's done it
before; if he took some more time
between pictures he could likely
do it again.

In June, House Democrats
proposed to increase the federal
minimum wage to $10 an hour.
It's currently $7.25 an hour. House
Democrats argue that the federal
minimum wage is below inflation.
The minimum wage was highest in
1968 at $1.60 an hour, which today
would be roughly $10 an hour.
Many House Republicans argue
that the market should determine
minimum wage and are therefore
against passing this bill.
At the very least, the federal
minimum wage should keep up
with inflation. While Michigan
is one of a few states in the U.S.
to set its minimum wage higher
than the national minimum wage
- at $7.40 an hour - this is still
too far below what it should be.
Here at the University, 70 percent
of undergraduate and graduate
students receive some form of
financial aid, and many of them

get a job in college to start paying
off their debt. With most of these
jobs paying minimum wage, it
isn't feasible for students to start
paying off their loans when they
might only be making $7.40 an
hour. While an increase to $10
an hour is only keeping up with
inflation, it will make a huge dif-
ference for millions of struggling
students.
According to the Economic
Policy Institute, 30 million Ameri-
canswouldbenefitifthe minimum
wagewasraisedto$10 anhour,and
these potential beneficiaries range
from high school students to the
elderly. It's a huge misconception
that only young people supported
by their parents are making mini-
mum wage. For many people, this
small wage is all they have to sup-
port themselves - and for some,
their entire family. And, with
30 million people making more

money, spending power would be
increased and the economy would
likelybebolstered. This acthasthe
potential to positively affect a sub-
stantial and diverse portion of the
American population.
Increasing the minimum wage
to keep up with inflation shouldn't
be a partisan issue. But unfortu-
nately for millions of Americans,
it is. By raising the minimum
wage to $10 an hour, students
would have the opportunity to
pay off their debts quicker, and
adults would be able to provide
for themselves and their families
with greater ease. Leaders in both
parties have the rare opportunity
to unite on an issue that has the
potential to not only help millions
of people make a more reasonable
amount of money, but also to help
the economy. And telling young
constituents to "get a job" is not
the way to help the situation.

Idle 'Savages'-bores.

Heart beats far
out of rhythm

Creativity lost

Menage a no:
'Savages' bad with
romance and script
By NOAH COHEN
For the Daily
Though Oliver Stone contin-
ues to live up to his reputation for
unflinching violence, the truth
remains clear:
violence, sex
and drugs do not*
make a movie.S
Even under the
influence of some At Quality16
glowing act- and Rave
ing and nonstop
action, "Savages" Universal
manages to bore.
The movie is a film adaptation
of a book written by Don Winslow,
who is a much better writer than
this screenplay would suggest.
The movie follows two marijuana
entrepreneurs, Ben (Aaron John-
son, "Albert Nobbs") and Chon
(Taylor Kitch, "Battleship"), as
they attempt to skirt domination
by an ambitious Mexican cartel.
They fail, however, as their shared
girlfriend 0 (Blake Lively, "The

'NACHOOOOOOOO!'
Town") falls into the clutches of
Elena (Salma Hayek, TV's "30
Rock"), the almost-ruthless king-
pin. The game is then set in motion,
with Ben-and Chon attempting to
comply with the demands of the
cartel so that O does not suffer con-.
sequences, meanwhile grasping at
leverage over Elena with which to
ensure O's rescue.
The dynamic among the three
protagonists - Ben, Chon and 0
- works hard to convince the audi-
ence of its sincerity as a functional
menage. A trois, and, against the
odds, succeeds. We believe that

they are a cohesive romantic unit,
and this lays the foundation for the
much more interesting dynamic
between the men, Ben and Chon.
Ben is the mastermind of the
operation. The dreadlocked, Bud-
dhist, scientist-hippy who believes
conflict can be resolved with
peaceful deliberation. This belief
is repeatedly stomped upon over
the course of the movie, which is
where Chon comes in. Chon is the
ever-alert muscle, unafraid and
more than capable of handling
what Ben cannot stomach. 0, as the
narrator, makes the Spirit/Earth
dichotomy very clear at the out-
set, and the relationship the two
men share is touched upon even
by Elena and her fantastically
creepy right-hand-man, Lado
(Benicio Del Toro, "The Wolf-
man"), who suspects the two are
"faggots."
Lively is good, not exceptional,
as the narrator, and plays a good,
not exceptional, damsel in dis-
tress. Playing her captor, Hayek
does a much better job with her
own archetype, excellently bal-
ancing the expected fragility of
someone who genuinely loves
with the gritof a leader for whom
love is translated as weakness.
Del Toro shines as brightly as
scum can shine, but may have
taken a little too much initiative
in makingthe audience hate him.
His creepiness goes beyond the
pale, and finds an electric chem-
istry with Dennis, the DEA agent
played by John Travolta, who has
a deceptively small part in the
action of the movie, but whose
role weirdly and unexpectedly
mars the movie's ending in a big
way.

I spent my childhood similarly
to how I imagine many of you did
- without a care or worry in the
world. As chil-
dren, we act on
impulse, explore '
the world
around us and
are intrigued by
everything we
touch. Whether
hunting for lep-
rechauns on the SARAH
playground or SKALUBA
starting a pot
and pan rock
band, my child-
hood memories bring back a sense
of imagination and raw creativity.
But somewhere along the way, this
innocent creativityis lost and tucked
away for good.
Eventually, we mature and begin
to focus on more refined artistic
skills. Whether it's playing a wind
instrument, painting with water-
color or writing prose, high school
encourages us to nourish our cre-
ativity and express our innermost
thoughts and feelings. From honors
wind ensemble to advanced paint-
ing and drawing, the opportunity to
engage our artistic side exists and
we take advantage of it.
This focus on creativity and fos-
tering our artistic side is a large part
of growing up. We're taught to be
expressive, to think imaginatively
and discover our passions. But this
no longer proves useful when we
pack up our bags and head to college.
Of course, there are the gifted
among us who come to the Univer-
sity to attend the School of Art &
Design or the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance. But the majority of us
enroll in LSA and are lost in a new
community that favors intelligence
and brains. We lose sight of our past
hobbies and focus on getting the
highes grade point average possible.
Stumbling along as young freshmen
at Michigan, we quickly learn that
creativity is not a priority - in fact,
it's almost frowned upon. Previous
all-state musicians stow away their
instruments for good, and passion-
ate artists pack up their supplies
once and for all.
Our society today emphasizes
the intellectual power of individu-
als. Strength is seen in those who
obtain high test scores, declare dif-
ficult majors and maintain 4.0 GPAs
despite takinga million credits. But
what ever happened to the idea that
we should follow our passion and
engage our artistic side?
We come to Michigan and are
overwhelmed by the difficulty of
huge lectures, the enormity of a
40,000-person student body and, of
course, the freshman social scene.
We inevitably lose sight of our high
school passions as we begin a new
chapter in our lives. It's difficult to

balance an intense class load with a
decent social life and still find free
find time to write, paint or dance.
The world in which we live favors
intellectual ability over artistic
ability. It favors methodology over,
creativity. We're living in a soci-
ety that pushes us to take as many
classes as possible while still main-
taining extraordinary GPAs and
acing every exam. The strong dis-
tinction between what's perceived
as a difficult major as opposed to
the -"easy" ones is evident in the
way people respond when they ask,
"So what exactly are you studying
up in Michigan?"
High GPAs are
valued over
creativity.
As an undeclared junior according
to my transcript, I find people's reac-
tions to a Brain, Behavior and Cog-
nitive Science concentration - as
opposed to an English Language and
Literature concentration - amus-
ing. Granted, I'll most likely major
in both, but the demeaning looks
and skeptical nods associated with
an English concentration are neither
appreciated nor necessary..
The huge emphasis placed on sci-
ence, math and business degrees
won't be ending anytime soon. But
that doesn't mean we should place
our creative interests and passions
on the backburner. Take advantage
of all the student groups and clubs
our University has to offer. Whether
your passion lies in fashion, music,
writing or art, it's up to you to hold
onto your individual creativity and
raw sense of imagination.
We shouldn't only strive to stay
passionate about old interests but
also work to develop new ones. At
a University with so much to offer,
we have the power to break societal
norms and prove there's more to
a well-rounded education than an
immense class load and a spotless
GPA. Part of what makes us such a
diverse campus is the past experi-
ences and creative abilities we each
bring to Michigan. So don't bury
your passion and lose sight of what
excites you. Instead, foster your cre-
ativity and make it a point to take
advantage of groups like MDrawand
the crazy courses that only our Uni-
versity could offer.

As the 100-plus-degree
days hopefully become fewer
and farther between, it's that
exciting
time of year
when over-
achievers
receive
their syllabi
for their falll
coursework
and delve in. MICHAEL
When they SMALLEGAN
take that
head start
on the jour-
ney along that nearly sacred
roadmap - the syllabus - very
few will stop to think about the
document itself.
The syllabus is undoubtedly
a product of the hard work of
educators who thought a lot
about how a coherent narrative
will unravel over 13 weeks. It's
probably the result of multiple
iterations of - the course and
reflection on what went well
and what needed to be changed.
It demarcates readings, prob-
lem sets, exams and all the
other familiar mechanisms of a
well-oiled course.
Let's take one step further
back and examine the syllabus
from there. The document is a
collection of concepts organized
around a central theme. Either
tradition or innovation decreed
that these concepts should be
taught together, that they are
somehowunified and that learn-
ing them all together would be
more beneficial than learning
them separately.
Butisthatreallythecase?Cer-
tainly the story of British colo-
nialism segues nicely into the
story of the American Revolu-
tion. So for some history courses,
a narrative style works perfectly.
Perhaps for most of the trivium, a
story format fits nicely, but what
of the quadrivium? Of math, cell

biology or physics?
I can vividly recall multiple
instances in which, sitting in
class last fall, my internal nar-
rative sounded like this: "Hey,
what? We're learning this now?
I could have used this math
concept three weeks ago in
my physics class!" Actually, at
times, the voice in my head is a
bit more vulgar when expressing
distaste, but you get the idea.
Ideas are further catego-
rized not only into syllabi and
courses, but also into depart-
ments. And with those depart-
ments trying to determine the
overlap between courses and
the proper ordering of courses,
there just isn'tenough time and
communication within depart-
ments to have the perfect
coherent ordering of ideas and
classes and to completely mini-
mize overlap. So, as long as we
have syllabi, we may learn how
to find the cross product of two'
vectors in three different class-
es, or by bad luck - or good luck,
depending on your view - we
may never run across Lagrange
multipliers.
We have both the technology
and the understanding of how
concepts build on each other
to take a more systematic and
strategic approach to pedagogy.
So what would school without
classes and narratives and syl-
labi look like?
It would be more individu-
alized - we have the IT infra-
structure to track the concepts
each student has mastered.
Though this is a bit more granu-
lar than tracking classes mas-
tered, the process is the same.
It would be easier - we know
that building concepts on top of
what you've already learned is
easier than skipping steps. Fur-
thermore, when you have a solid
foundation, it takes much less
time to learn new ideas.

It would be harder to teach
- certainly having 80 people
learning the same thing at the
same time presents some "effi-
ciencies" for the education
provider, and in the past these
aspects have trumped teach-
ing the concepts students need
at the time and in the order the
students need them. It's a huge
challenge to provide a more
modular education, but chal-
lenges exist to be overcome.
Syllabi may not
be effective for
all classes.
Already, online courses and
TED videos are providing more
modular, compact concepts
packaged in 10- to 20-minute
videos. When you walk away
from a TED video, you have a
new idea in hand, and you're
ready to use it. That concept
doesn't need to be embedded
in a 13-week format for you to
grasp it. Software products
such as Knewton and Cogni-
tive Tutor implement "adap-
tive learning," which actively
tracks what students know and
what they are having trouble
learning, and then measures
out exactly where they need
further teaching.
So, the questions become:
How long will it take higher
education to adopt new meth-
ods? Who will be a part of find-
ing solutions to the challenges?
Will it be you?

Break-in, attempted

'God, these people are, like, so old.
'People Like Us'
too common to be
memorable
By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily Arts Writer
Sometime in the recent past,
"first world problems" has become
a viable sub-genre of indie film,
and "People
Like Us" is the
latest install-
ment to add to . People Like Us
the pile. Like
the entire At Quality 16
subcategory, and Rave
it has little Touchstone
to add to the
world of cin-
ema but thankfully takes nothing
away.
"People Like Us" is the story
of smooth-talking barter expert
Sam (Chris Pine, "This Means
War") who has to come to terms
with his daddy issues after said
daddy passes away. Turns out
Sam's record-producer father
had a secret daughter Frankie
(Elizabeth Banks, "The Hunger
Games") who in turn has a smart-
ass son (newcomer Michael Hall
D'Addario). Intrigued by the two
and enticed by their inheritance,
Sam creeps into the lives of his sis-
ter and nephew in a generic narra-
tive of love and redemption.
And therein lies the problem,
not only with "People Like Us," but
with all filns of the as-yet-unla-
belled "first world problems" sub-
group: It's generic. Sam's problems
with his father are standard issue;
he didn't spend enough time with
him, his dad kept secrets, boo-
hoo. Yes, more of the audience can

relate, but why would they want
to? If you want common problems,
go back to reality. Is it too much
to ask for movies to be an escape
from that?
Still, "People Like Us" has its
revelations, the main one being
Chris Pine in an almost-effortless
turn as serious actor and not just
the giver of the smoldering gaze.
He inhabits Sam easily from the
first scene and boldly goes into the
uncharted territories of confusion,
angst, rage and regret. There's a
particularly random montage of
Sam getting drunk and listening to
his father's old records while try-
ing to track down Frankie's bio-
logical mother; the scene leads to
nothing, but Pine's performance is
transfixing.
D'Addario charms as well,
exploring every shade between
rude and impish that an eleven-
year old boy can inhabit. In the
end, he draws the estranged sib-
lings together and proves to be
the most mature character in the
film.
There are certain scenes
between Frankie and Sam that
get tense. Not Jamie-and-Cersei
tense - hell, not even Luke-and-
Leia tense - but enough to make
the casual viewer tighten up a bit
and hope that Frankie can ignore
the objectively hot Chris Pine vis-
age before her and friendzone him
like there's no tomorrow. Nothing
actually happens, but it's enough
to mar the film experience and
Sam's character altogether.
In a summer of superheroes,
male strippers and talking teddy
bears, "People Like Us" tries to
be the normative film that mov-
iegoers might just need. Unfortu-
nately, it's not the film people like
us want.

Ding-dong, the witch is dead!
That's what the very, very few of
us who still watch "Weeds" pro-
claimed joyously after last season's
finale, where
yet another
gimmicky, sea-
son-bridging Weeds
cliffhanger fea-
tured the head Showtime
of Nancy (Mary- Season Premiere
Louise Parker),
the pot-growing
suburban matri-
arch of the Botwin clan, nestled
squarely within the crosshairs of a
not-so-distant sniper.
If Showtime had had the guts
to follow through on. it's setup, it
would've been a welcome end to a
character whose questionable judg-
ment has managed to somehow
devastate the lives of everybody
she comes into contact with. But
unfortunately, as "Weeds" has done
time and time again over the course
of its now eight-year run, the show
cops out. Nancy's left in a coma,
her head having endured far less
damage than bullets usually do to
peoples' skulls on TV (or in real life
for that matter), and we're left with
a half-hour of typically meaning-
less bedside patter from the whiney,
emasculated supporting cast that
doubles as Nancy's family.
The cast's comedic flatness and
undeniable group dysfunction isn't
really their fault. Like the show
itself, they've been dragged across
rough asphalt behind the highly
profitable franchise that is the Bot-
win family car/camper/trailer, from
Agrestic, to Renmar, to Seattle, to
Dearborn and now, in what Show-
timepromises is the show's last sea-
son, Connecticut/New York. Along
the way, we've seen show creator
Jenji Kohan take a promising prem-
ise and a cast of atypically strong
female characters, and turn them
into a collection of reprehensible
characters who are either too rote
to enjoy or so selfishly motivated
that it's not even fun to hate them.
Case in point: Nancy herself. As
her sons sit beside her comatose
body and wonder who could've put
a bullet in her skull, they reminisce
about the who's who of psychotic
criminal scumbags their mother
has gone out of her way to offend. In
addition to standard costs of doing
business, like the Mexican cartel
and the Armenian mob, they list

on 1200 block of
Oakland Ave.
By ANNA ROZENBERG
ManagingNews Editor
A student's home was broken
into on the 1200 block of Oakland
Avenue early in the morning on
July 2, according to Ann Arbor
Police.
After breaking into the apart-
ment and attempting to assault a
female resident, the perpetrator

was interrupted by a witness and
fled the building, according to a
crime alert sent from the Depart-
ment of Public Safety.
The crime alert described the
culprit as "Black male, mid-20s,
dark complexion and short hair."
The AAPD also sent out an
alert with the same information
earlier today.
AAPD Sergeant. Paul Curtis
said the department can't offer
further details but the AAPD is
investigating the incident.
"We'll be looking into it - I can
assure you that," he said.
Crimestoppers is offering an
$1,000 reward to anyone with
information leading to an arrest.
