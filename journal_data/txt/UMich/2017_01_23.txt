Last 
winter, 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Sam 
Greeley 

developed a severe case of 
Achilles 
tendinitis, 
an 
ankle 

injury confining her to crutches 
for weeks, adding unexpected 
challenges to her daily life.

After 
receiving 
attention 

from the University of Michigan 
Hospital, 
Greeley 
was 
not 

informed of the accommodations 
available to her from Services 
for Students with Disabilities. It 
was not until two days after her 
hospital visit that she learned 
about 
the 
services 
available 

to 
students 
with 
temporary 

conditions.

“I wasn’t given any contact 

information for a ride or a cab 
(from the hospital),” Greeley said. 
“While you are mostly mobile on 
crutches, travelling just down 
the hallway, especially in the 
beginning, was very tiresome.”

In 2015-2016, 108 students 

were registered with temporary 
disabilities, according to the 
SSD 
Annual 
Report. 
When 

students injure themselves, they 
face an unanticipated number 
of challenges when confined to 
crutches, wheelchairs and others 
walking aids. All services are free 
to students.

Nursing sophomore Madison 

Farmer broke her ankle during 
the winter of 2016 and was put on 
crutches. She wasn’t aware of SSD 
until four days after her injury.

“I was (using Uber to go) to all 

of my classes, but that got very 
expensive and so someone told me 
about Services for Students with 
Disabilities,” Farmer said.

SSD offers a number of services 

to 
students 
with 
temporary 

disabilities, including Paratransit, 
which provides a free ride to 
students with disabilities around 
campus, and adjustable furniture, 
to ease the pain of injuries and 

accommodate any student.

SSD Director Stuart Segal 

his 
office 
could 
improve 

communication about its services. 
Often, students with permanent 
or temporary disabilities remain 
unaware of the services available 
to them.

“I have to admit, this is one area 

where I think we could do a better 
job because this not only concerns 

students 
with 
temporary 

disabilities, this concerns students 
with all the disabilities,” Segal 
said. “It breaks my heart when 
I talk to a senior, who has been 
here four or five years, finally 
somehow makes it here and gets 
the accommodations and they 
look at me and they say: ‘Jeez I 
wish I knew you guys were here 
four years ago.’ ”

The number of high-dose opioid 

painkiller prescriptions written 
to veterans has declined following 
the release of a Veterans Health 
Administration plan to reduce the 
potentially addictive substance, 
according to a new study conducted 
by the University of Michigan and 
Ann Arbor researchers. 

Published 
in 
the 
scientific 

journal Pain, the research study 
found prescriptions written from 
high-dose 
opioids 
decreased 

by 16 percent and prescriptions 
written for very high-dose opioids 
decreased by 24 percent. The 
journal also noted the prescribed 
combination 
of 
opioids 
and 

sedatives, a possibly a deadly one, 
decreased by 21 percent over the 
course of two years.

The plan, coined the Opioid 

Safety Initiative, was introduced 
in 2013 in an attempt to reduce 
risky 
opioid 
prescribing 
and 

other 
potentially 
lethal 
drug 

combinations.

The OSI is a computer system 

that oversees prescriptions and 
provides physicians with additional 
knowledge for safer prescribing.

The Ann Arbor City Council 

approved a $143,296 contract 
with 
OHM 
Advisors 
— 
an 

architectural 
firm 
based 
in 

Livonia — earlier last week to 
conduct a complete inspection of 
the city’s streetlights, including 
prioritization of repairs and cost 
estimates. Such an inspection 
occurs 
at 
least 
once 
every 

10 years, according to City 
Councilmember Chip Smith (D–
Ward 5).

Smith said the inspection is 

regular, but noted it is coming 
after city employees noticed 
the bottoms of lamp posts were 
“rusted out” while looking into 
replacing lights in the Kerrytown 
neighborhood of Ann Arbor.

Last October, Huron High 

School student Qi-Xuan “Justin”

Road while on his way to school. 
Since 
that 
accident, 
more 

streetlights have been installed

Michigan students, Ann Arbor residents travel to 
D.C. to attend rallies alongside state lawmakers 

CAROLYN GEARIG/Daily

Protestors for the Women’s March walk through Washington D.C on Saturday. The rally began at 10:00 am and attendees began marching at 2:30.

50 local women, 4 men take bus, aim to promote women’s rights, protest election of President Trump at national march

- LSA senior, Florence Rivkin

Ann Arbor was still dark at 7:45 

a.m. as staff shielded by umbrellas 
from the rain filed into the LSA 
Building. Outside, a group of 50 
women and four men in damp coats 
and signs shielded in plastic bags, 
some seeking refuge under the 
angles of the Cube, waited for their 
bus to Washington D.C. to arrive.

In about four hours, Donald 

Trump would be sworn in as 45th 
president of the United States and 

the 44th president, Barack Obama, 
would board a helicopter and fly out 
of the capital he had called home for 
eight years.

The bus would never make it to 

D.C. by then, but it never intended 
to. The women weren’t interested 
celebrating 
the 
inauguration, 

rather, they wanted to be there for 
the aftermath. On Friday, Trump 
was inaugurated, and on Saturday, 
women from all over the country 
would gather for the Women’s 
March on Washington.

A week before the inauguration, 

The Washington Post reported 

that city officials had received 200 
permit requests for bus parking for 
the inauguration itself, and 1,200 
for the Women’s March. Going into 
Jan. 20, the president-elect had a 
37-percent approval rating.

Trump’s election was met with 

mixed emotions across the country 
— the president lost the popular 
vote but won on the electoral. Many 
women were saddened by the loss 
of Democratic candidate Hillary 
Clinton, and even more so the loss 
of the prospect of the first female 
president. Regardless of political 
party, though, women were weary 

of the incoming president — for 
his policies threatening issues like 
reproductive health, and for his 
rhetoric against women (see: the 
infamous “grab her by the pussy” 
hot mike video).

It was these concerns which 

prompted the surge of Facebook 
events for women organizing and 
demonstrating in response. The 
movement eventually consolidated 
under the Women’s March on 
Washington — though, there were 
also smaller marches across the 
country — including one in Ann 
Arbor.

LSA senior Florence Rivkin, 

donning 
a 
pink 
“WOMEN’S 

HEALTH MATTERS” shirt, stood 
at the front of the bus and explained 
why she would march.

“I think it’s going to be a really 

lovely message to show thousands 
and thousands of people, women, 
men, every identity, coming together 
and showing everyone that we 
actually love each other and the U.S. 
doesn’t have to be a hateful place,” 
Rivkin said. “I want the Trump 
administration to know I am going 
to be fighting for my rights and I am 
going to be fighting for everybody 

else’s rights … this is the beginning 
of a movement, not the end.”

Rivkin organized the event with 

high-school-friend-turned-college-
roommate 
LSA 
senior 
Lalitha 

Ramaswamy. Rivkin was upset 
following the election and a family 
friend suggested she do something 
about it and go to the march.

“I came home and Lalitha was 

sitting in our room and I was like, 
should we do this?” Rivkin said. 
“And she was like, yeah. And she 
made the Facebook event and we 
ordered the bus the next day.”

On Monday, the 660-square-

foot Michigan Solar House (MiSo) 

will be moved to Evart, Mich., in 

Osceola County.

Constructed for the 2005 Solar 

Decathlon in Washington D.C., 

the house was a collaborative, 

interdisciplinary project between 

students and faculty from the 

Taubman School of Architecture 

and Urban Planning and several 

other University departments. 

Since its completion, MiSo has sat 

in Ann Arbor’s Matthaei Botanical 

Gardens as a public exhibit to help 

raise awareness for solar power and 

technology.

The house was sold to Lisa and 

Matt Gunneson last fall. This week, 

the couple will begin transportation 

of the house to their property in 

Evart, where they will live in the 

modular, solar-powered house full-

time.

When the house was placed 

on the market by the UM Finance 

Procurement Services last October, 

the Gunnesons knew they wanted 

to make MiSo their home. Lisa 

Gunneson, a natural health 

therapist and educator, said they 

were looking for a house that would 

allow them to live a more natural, 

back-to-the-earth lifestyle.

“When we heard the solar home 

was up for auction, we put in a bid 

because we really want to live a 

simple, self-sufficient kind of life,” 

Gunnerson told MLive.

The Gunnesons also had a 

special connection to the Matthaei 

Botanical Gardens: the couple went 

to the gardens for their first date, 

and were married there in 2015.

The house — covered in 

aluminum casing and 30 solar 

panels — converts solar energy into 

hot water that provides power for 

all the house’s heating and electric 

needs. According to Architecture 

Prof. Harry Giles, the original 

faculty supervisor for the project, 

the house produces more energy 

than it uses. Inside the home, 

MiSo has a living room, kitchen, 

dining room and one bedroom. But 

Giles said it would be possible to 

expand MiSo into a two-bedroom, 

950-square-foot house with the 

addition of more modules.

The creators originally 

designed it as a prototype to be 

mass-produced, though they have 

not yet built anymore like it. It 

was “envisioned as a residential 

module that would be universal, 

autonomous, and easily transported 

around the globe,” according to the 

Taubman School’s website.

Geoffrey Thün, associate dean 

for research and creative practice at 

the Taubman College, told the Daily 

in October that the goal of MiSo, 

and of the whole Solar Decathlon 

competition, was to expose more 

Americans to renewable energy 

living.

“It was a mechanism that was 

set up by the Department of Energy 

whose role was to try to expose 

new thinking associated with 

renewable energy to as wide a group 

of American citizens as possible,” 

Thün said.

Tomorrow, the Ann Arbor-

based company Meadowlark 

Design + Build will transport the 

house from the gardens to the 

Gunneron’s Evart property. The 

Gunnesons hope to be living in the 

house full-time by spring. In the 

meantime, they’re working with 

Meadowlark to make the house a 

net-zero impact home, meaning 

it would be completely self-

sustained.

 “This is a one-of-a-kind 

home, and our expertise in 

sustainable construction will 

help ensure the Gunnesons 

transport and restore the home 

exactly to their specifications,” 

said Doug Selby, CEO of 

Meadowlark Design + Build, in 

a press release to PRNewswire.

com. “It’s also a labor of love, as 

two of our staff members, Jen 

Hinesman and Melissa Kennedy, 

were part of the University of 

Michigan team that created the 

MiSo back in 2005.

University of Michigan Regent 

Ron Weiser (R) is expected to head 
the Michigan Republican Party 
beginning in February, after his 
only opponent dropped out of the 
race.

Scott 
Hagerstrom, 
who 

directed Trump’s campaign in 
Michigan during the election, 

posted on Facebook Sunday he 
was withdrawing from the race 
for Michigan GOP chair and 
endorsing his opponent Weiser.

In his statement, he praised 

Weiser’s history and expressed 
Weiser’s 
preparation 
for 

Republican leadership.

“After meeting with multiple 

members of the Trump White 
House, I’ve decided that the best 
way I can help make Michigan 
Great Again is to withdraw from 

the race for MIGOP Chair,” 
Hagerstrom wrote. “This is not 
the end, but the beginning of 
something great. I am confident 
that Ron Weiser understands 
that the future of the Michigan 
Republican 
Party 
lies 
in 

embracing 
the 
constitutional 

principles that led to President 
Trump’s historic victory.”

Weiser and Hagerstrom were 

the only two candidates up for 
the position. In a Facebook post, 

Weiser lauded Hagerstrom for 
his continuing work with the 
party and said his help will 
be imperative in the coming 
months.

“Scott 
is 
an 
excellent 

leader who is very important 
to 
making 
certain 
that 

Republicans 
win 
again,” 

Weiser 
wrote. 
“We 
will 

unite our party for victory 
in 2018 to elect a Republican 
Governor 
and 
Republican 

US Senator who will help 
President Trump implement 
conservative policies for our 
nation.”

Hagerstrom is not the 

only 
endorsement 
Weiser 

has received for the position. 
On Thursday, Trump’s Chief 
of Staff Reince Priebus and 
Chief Strategist Steve Bannon 
penned a letter recommending 
Weiser for the position.

In the letter, Priebus and 

Bannon wrote the best way 
to maintain control of once-
blue states like Michigan is by 
nominating Weiser.

“Our task now is to keep 

Michigan a red state, and Ron 
Weiser is the right choice to 
lead that charge as Chairman 
of the Michigan Republican 
Party,” Priebus and Bannon 
wrote.

Weiser 
announced 
his 

campaign back in December. 
The position was vacated by 
Ronna Romney McDaniel, 
who will be heading the 
Republican 
National 

Committee.

The initiative was implemented in 
the national, integrated health care 
system of the Veterans Association 
and provided support to physicians 
monitoring patients using opioids.

According to the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention, 
patients who take opioids may 
develop tolerance over time and 
the effectiveness of the drug 
may decrease. Overdose related 
to opioids is associated with the 
dosage given. The higher the dose 
of opioids, the increased likelihood 
of an overdose.

Michael 
Clay, 
an 
assistant 

professor of internal medicine at 
University’s Medical School who 
worked on the study, emphasized 
that 
opioids 
generally 
have 

minimal benefit for chronic pain 
and are traditionally used for acute 
pain. He highlighted the central 
responsibilities of a prescriber if 
opioids are considered for chronic 
pain relief.

“The prescriber needs try all 

other options for chronic pain 
management — physical therapy, 
injections, psychology, ‘alternative’ 

therapies like acupuncture — 
before 
considering 
prescribing 

opioids,” Clay said. “The provider 
needs to then weigh all of the 
risks 
of 
opioids 
(addiction, 

death, depression, constipation, 
decreased testosterone in men and 
many others) and make sure that 
patients understand these risks.”

The Medical School evaluated 

the effectiveness of the OSI used 
in 
Veterans 
Affairs 
hospitals 

nationwide. The Institute for 
Healthcare Policy and Innovation, 
the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor 
Healthcare 
System 
and 
Yale 

University also collaborated on the 
project.

Lewei Lin, the study’s first 

author and an addiction fellow 
in the University’s Department 
of Psychiatry, emphasized how 
this study is one of the first to 
look at a health care system’s 
role in risky opioid prescriptions 
at a national level.

“What I am hoping is that this 

would give further support to 
other health care systems, for 
example, University of Michigan 
or other health care systems 
around the country in thinking 
about, within the health care 
system, how to help providers 

prescribe more safely,” Lin said.

The OSI was designed to 

be used in different settings, 
including urban and rural VA 
hospitals as well as local clinics. 
Because of this, there was 
variation in the ways the OSI 
was implemented.

Clay highlighted the quality 

and quantity of resources may 
help explain the distinction 
between 
rural 
and 
urban 

hospitals.

“For 
example, 
the 
Ann 

Arbor VA has many national 
experts in the field and they 
were able to help out with our 
OSI 
implementation,” 
Clay 

said. “We used a variety of 
professions to help implement 
OSI: physicians, pharmacists, 
psychologists, 
physical 

therapists. 
As 
a 
primary 

care physician, I was the 
lead for our facility. Other 
facilities used psychologists 
or pharmacists as the lead and 
did not have as many resources 
as VA hospitals with strong 
university affiliations.”

to 25 mph during hours of heavy 
student traffic.

There still is no general cost 

estimate, 
but 
Councilmember 

Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) noted “it 
will be expensive.”

“I think that’s part of it, you 

know, you can’t budget for what 
you don’t know, so getting that 
baseline is critical,” she said. 
“Because we’re always going 
to have to make decisions that 
involve 
tradeoffs, 
and 
this 

gives us –– you can’t make the 
decisions without having that 
information.”

Money is tight right now in 

city government; in an earlier 
City Council planning session, 
Tom 
Crawford, 
the 
Chief 

Financial Officer for the city, said 
he expected budget deficits of 
$318,000 in fiscal year 2017-18, 
starting in July 2017, and $992,000 
in fiscal year 2018-19. According 
to Smith, Crawford also made 
recommendations 
during 
the 

last two budget cycles that the 
city set aside $700,000 annually 
to go toward the inspection and 
repair of streetlights, but that 
the full recommendation was 
not completed. Neither Smith 
nor City Administrator Howard 
Lazarus were sure how much was 
actually set aside.

“I 
know 
that 
the 
CFO 

Tom 
Crawford 
has 
made 

recommendations during the 
last two budget cycles that we 
set aside $700,000 annually 
to go into that, but that was 
not done in the last two-year 
cycle,” he said. “There was some 
money set aside, but not the full 
recommendation.”

Despite this, Segal said his 

area of knowledge and day-to-
day work revolved more around 
accommodating 
students 
with 

learning disabilities. Segal said 
Dan Measel, an SSD coordinator 
for students with chronic health 
conditions and visual and mobility 
impairments, oversees students 
with temporary disabilities within 
the office; however, Measel could 
not be reached for comment at the 
time of publication.

In some cases, SSD services 

were inadequate to meet the needs 
of students. Greeley struggled to do 
laundry and she and Farmer had 
trouble into the dining hall. SSD 
does not assist students with these 
tasks, according to their website.

“You can’t hold any plates,” 

Greeley said. “There were days if 
my roommate or my friends didn’t 
have a break where they could 
come back to the dining hall and 
help me out … there were days that 
I didn’t eat until seven o’clock at 
night.”

Farmer agreed, saying the 

University 
could 
provide 
an 

alternative dining experience.

“I really wish I would’ve been 

able to have unlimited to-go meals 

and have someone actually bring 
them to my dorm,” Farmer said. “It 
would’ve been a 10-minute process 
instead of a 45-minute process to 
get a bowl of cereal.”

To access the dining hall in 

Bursley, Farmer had to take an 
unconventional route.

“I had to go to the service 

elevator, where people would drop 
food deliveries, which took me up 
through the kitchen and then I 
had to go through the kitchen to 
get to the dining hall,” Famer said. 
“Which, I mean, when you’re on 
crutches, seems a little dangerous 
because you don’t know if the floor 
is wet.”

Farmer included that she had a 

tough time showering and eating 
due to a lack of handicap access to 
the dining hall.

“I actually ended up sitting 

on my longboard and my friends 
pushed me across the entire 
building to get to the handicap 
shower,” Farmer said.

Transportation
A foot injury leading to an ankle 

boot confined LSA freshman Gabi 
de Coster the first week of the fall 
semester while living in Mary 
Markley Residence Hall. Once 
winter began, de Coster worked 
with 
housing 
and 
eventually 

moved to South Quad to avoid the 
long walk from the hill while she 
was still in a boot. At this point, 

de Coster took advantage of the 
Paratransit services offered by 
SSD.

“I never met with anyone 

physically, but I did make a phone 
call asking about my options 
… so I could get in touch with 
Paratransit,” de Coster said.

For 
many 
students 
with 

temporary 
disabilities, 
once 

they reached out to SSD, many 
of their needs were met. Simply 
receiving a ride around campus at 
students’ convenience made their 
experience much better.

LSA 
sophomore 
Natalie 

Jackson, who broke her leg in 
November 2015, wrote in an email 
interview 
Paratransit 
services 

helped her get around to almost 
everywhere she went during the 
winter.

“I had to go to physical therapy 

and every morning there was a 
car that picked me up and took me 
there,” Jackson wrote.

Due to the high demand of 

Paratransit services, Blue Cab, a 
private taxi service which services 
Ann Arbor and surrounding areas, 
is often used in place of Paratransit 
when there aren’t enough cars to 
get students to where they need to 
be.

Segal said SSD only coordinates 

rides 
between 
students 
and 

Paratransit.

“Paratransit is run through

The pair originally had enough 

students signed up to take two 
buses, though not enough paid in 
time to book the second — “and we 
can’t front $5,000,” Rivkin said. 
Many on the bus knew Rivkin or 
Ramaswamy, but others came after 
catching wind of the Facebook 
event or through friends. Some, 
like LSA sophomore Renae Lyons, 
even came on their own.

“I signed up for this by myself; 

I just heard that the bus was 
going and I felt really compelled 
to go,” Lyons, who was upset with 
Trump’s election, said. “I have 
the privilege to go and I felt like it 
would be a total waste if I didn’t 
take advantage of that.”

Now, riding down State Street 

in Ann Arbor on the single bus, 
the women asked the riders to say 
their reasons for marching, along 
with the answer to one of three 
questions: Who would you want 
to perform at your inauguration? 
What is your favorite Barack 
Obama moment? Or: If you could 
have anyone, from history or 
present, march alongside you, who 
would it be?

The passengers gave reasons 

ranging from health care and 
misogynistic rhetoric to climate 
change 
and 
immigration 
for 

attending. Laura Vicinanza, an 
LSA junior who enjoys Obama 
and Biden memes, marched for 
everyone 
whose 
rights 
could 

be under attack under the new 
administration.

“I was really devastated with the 

election results — it’s been a lot; it’s 
taken me so long to process — but I 
really want to go out and march and 
stand up for women’s rights and all 
of these other marginalized groups 
that the Trump administration had 
not really addressed,” Vicinanza 

said to the bus.

Many 
women, 
like 
LSA 

sophomore 
Megan 
Burns, 

cited privilege as a reason for 
attending — believing if they can 
go, they should, to march for both 
themselves and others who may 
not be able to.

“I am here to march because I 

believe it’s our job to speak up for 
all of the people who don’t have a 
voice,” Burns told the bus.

Burns, who is an Opinion writer 

the Daily, said were she to be 
elected president, she would like 
Obama and former Vice President 
Joe Biden to do a “sister act” on 
stage.

LSA sophomore Tansy Massey-

Green was inspired by her mom 
to attend the march and saw it as 
a critical first step following the 
election.

“I march today because I 

remember 
how 
devastated 
I 

was after the election — my first 
election — how badly it went,” 
Massey-Green said. “Lots of tears 
were shed and I called my mom 
and talked to her so long — she was 
very politically active when she 
was here at U of M — she told me 
to get out there and do whatever I 
can, and I thought this was the first 
thing I could have done. I’m here 
marching for the people who are 
going to get her the hardest by the 
incoming administration.”

At its core, many came to the 

march in opposition to Trump’s 
policies, 
though 
Ramaswamy 

emphasized that the march was 
not anti-Trump.

“I think so many of the ones 

after the election were about 
getting rid of him and hating 
him,” Ramaswamy said. “The 
fact that this is more for unifying 
and including everybody and 
fighting 
for 
people’s 
rights, 

rather than trying to kick out 
the administration it’s trying to 
make them listen so I think that 
distinction is really important 

about this march.”

Additionally important to the 

organizers was emphasizing peace 
going into the protest. Entering 
D.C., Ramaswamy warned riders 
there were rumors of people 
attending the rally to purposely 
ignite others.

“They are not part of the official 

march, they are purely there to 
riot and to cause something not 
peaceful to happen,” Ramaswamy 
said. “Don’t be dissuaded by that, 
but please be careful.”

A woman on the bus expressed 

concerns 
with 
tear-gas 
after 

the 
D.C. 
police 
tear-gassed 

inauguration protesters.

The 
organizers 
explained 

what to do in the event and urged 
marchers to look over the safety 
guide that they had emailed out, 
as well as remember to remain 
peaceful and remember why they 
had come.

Ramaswamy and Rivkin left 

housing up to the marchers, so 
after nearly nine hours on the blue 
charter bus with the pink Planned 
Parenthood sign in the windshield, 
marchers dispersed from the bus 
at the Stadium-Armory metro stop 
outside of D.C. with the promise of 
meeting at Hancock Park with the 
rest of the Michigan marchers the 
following morning.

*****
When their ride fell through at 

the last minute, LSA sophomore 
Dana Nathanson and LSA senior 
Natalie Burr borrowed a car the 
Friday before the rally from a 
housemate of their co-op and drove 
it down. Then their housing fell 
through after George Washington 
University, a college in D.C.’s 
Foggy 
Bottom 
neighborhood, 

barred visitors for the weekend 
because of the festivities. Still, they 
were determined to march and 
parked their car in an RV camp in 
Maryland where they slept for one 
night.

“I’m 
marching 
for 
human 

rights,” Nathanson said. “I like 
that the march is after the Trump 
inauguration because I feel like 
we’re getting the last word. I’m 
marching for not giving up and 
for being resilient in the next four 
years; for not forgetting how this 
happened.”

Lacing her hiking boots before 

heading out to meet with the other 
Michiganders, Nathanson fell back 
on the couch.

“So who’s excited for this post-

march nap?”

Everyone.
The post-march nap was, in 

fact, great. And for the most part, 
the march lived up to people’s 
expectations. Both of Michigan’s 
U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D) 
and Gary Peters (D) along with U.S. 
Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) 
spoke with about 200 marchers 
gathered at the Michigan meeting 
point before the rally, though 
staying together for the actual rally 
and march became impossible and 
most broke off into smaller groups. 
Though, not before the University 
of Michigan crew sang “Hail to the 
Victors.”

The march is being called the 

largest in human history with 
rallies being held on all seven 
continents and an estimated 3 

million participants. Despite the 
large crowds — in D.C. there being 
more than 600,000 marchers there 
were no instances of violence; 
something LSA senior Harry 
Freedman said he was thankful for 
afterward.

“My favorite part about the 

march was actually that no one was 
arrested,” Freedman said. “Of all of 
D.C. of all of the nearly 1 million 
people that were there, not a single 
person turned to violence enough 
to be arrested. No one protested 
in an unpatriotic, uncharacteristic 
manner that demeaned the march 
itself.”

Yet, issues still remained.
It was scheduled to start 

at 1:15 p.m. following a rally 
with a barrage of speakers and 
performers 
beginning 
at 
10 

a.m., but 1:15 p.m. rolled by, the 
speakers continued and ralliers 
became antsy. By 2:40 p.m., 
many began to march despite 
speakers such as Madonna and 
Amy Schumer still in queue. LSA 
junior Shanthi Veeramachaneni 
came to the march to show 
solidarity with others who do 
not support the president.

O

n Monday, Jan. 16, I 
attended 
the 
keynote 

Martin Luther King Jr. 

Symposium event at 
Hill Auditorium. And 
while I was there to 
see 
Amy 
Goodman 

and Issa Rae, I was 
really 
struck 
by 
a 

version of the U.S. 
national anthem that 
was performed by two 
graduate students.

The song, originally 

written in 1844, is 
titled “Oh Say, Do You 
Hear?” 
Performed 
to 

the tune of the national anthem 
to which most of us stand up 
without hesitation at sporting 
events, 
this 
version 
contains 

lyrics that refer explicitly to the 
United States’s history of bondage 
and slavery, and even points to 
the irony and the violence of 
American exceptionalism. This is 
an exceptionalism that demands 
that we, as Americans, regard 
ourselves as citizens of the land of 
the free, even while millions of our 
fellow citizens remain enslaved.

Here is the first verse of this 

revised version of our national 
anthem:

Oh, say do you hear, at the dawn’s 

early light,

The shrieks of those bondmen, 

whose blood is now streaming

From the merciless lash, while 

our banner in sight

With its stars, mocking freedom, 

is fitfully gleaming?

Do you see the backs bare? Do you 

mark every score

Of the whip of the driver trace 

channels of gore?

And say, doth our star-spangled 

banner yet wave

O’er the land of the free, and the 

home of the brave?

When juxtaposed with our 

national anthem, what is the 
impact of these lyrics? How does 
our response differ from the song 
that we know so well? Imagine, 
if you will, that after we watched 
Harbaugh and the Big Blue Gang 
run out onto the field, we all stood 
up and sang along to this song. 
Would we even sing along? Or 
would we be too embarrassed, 
too humiliated, by this song that 
functions both as our national 
anthem and as a cruel reminder 
of our past and as a song, heard 
in the present, which demands 
that we confront our past and ask 
ourselves how far we have truly 
come. Would we even stand? Or 
might this song actually prompt 
us to action? Maybe on good days, 

days when our culture has done 
well, days when our culture has 
worked to eradicate the growing 

wealth 
disparities, 

to decrease the more 
than 2 million people 
living in cages in this 
country. … Maybe on 
these days, we could 
hear the celebratory 
song. But not every 
day. Every day cannot 
be a celebration.

I once saw a Reddit 

post about smoking 
weed that made this 

analogy: Weed is like 

your vacation house, and at first 
you go there once a week, once a 
month and then you start going 
there every day, a couple times a 
day, maybe. And once you do this, 
you have begun to try to make 
your vacation house your everyday 
house. Very quickly, then, the 
vacation house loses its appeal. 
(In other words, the celebration, 

the vacation, stops being a positive 
thing entirely. It becomes a 
moment of denial, a moment in 
which one refuses to confront the 
world in front of them, instead 
opting to live in a fabricated, 
imagined world in which we can 
vacation all night long and sing 
“Hail to the Victors” — a song 
that does nothing but “celebrate” 
in a, I would argue, similarly 
destructive way).

Immediately, the lyrics of this 

version call to our attention the 
violently compliant nature with 
which we, as a culture, examine 
ourselves as Americans. These 
lyrics make two things clear: first, 
that while we deem our national 
anthem to be a quintessentially 
American 
song, 
the 
opening 

lines of this version allude to the 
inherently exclusionary nature of 
the song, indeed, of the idea that 
one is an American. Who, then, is 
fit to wear the priceless badge of an 

American? Whose history, whose 
country, does our national anthem 
celebrate? For it is a song that 
ignores the history of the country 
that it claims to celebrate. But what 
is a country — indeed, who are any 
of us, what is anything at all — 
without its history?

Instead of the country itself, 

our national anthem celebrates 
an idealized, racialized vision of 
America that only can function 
on the bloody backs of millions of 
enslaved people.

I must say, though, that I 

was really impressed that this 
performance took place here, 
at the University of Michigan. 
Sitting 
in 
Hill 
Auditorium, 

looking at the same stage upon 
which King himself once stood 
to give two lectures in 1962, I 
felt the University beginning to 
confront its own filthy history 
and that of the United States at 
large. It was the most radical 
administratively 
approved 

moment I have witnessed in 
Ann Arbor.

President Mark Schlissel was 

there, as was Robert Sellers, the 
Chief Diversity Officer and Vice 
President for Equity and Inclusion 
at the University, and numerous 
other big-time faculty members 
and administrators. The biggest 
head honcho missing from the 
event 
was 
Coach 
Harbaugh. 

Imagine that, if he came out, and 
if, perhaps, our fight song played. 
No, that could not happen. That 
would be too contradictory. That 
would put us into a position of 
two kinds of consciousness, one 
right after the other. The first “Go 
Blue!” consciousness that is, to 
quote Frank Ocean’s truth-telling 
mother, “Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and 
unconcerned.” A consciousness 
which celebrates blindly, which 
contentedly 
cheers 
without 

actually considering at all the full 
scope of what is being cheered.

And 
then 
the 
second 

consciousness, which probes itself 
and those conscious beings around 
it, which seeks to contextualize 
itself and its country within a 
much broader, more inclusive 
framework.

At least for a moment, this 

seemed to be the consciousness 
of the University. May we hope 
that this moment demonstrates 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
our 

administrators will lead us in the 
days, months and years to come.

D

o you remember how, for 
many Americans, Nov. 
9 (the day following the 

election of Donald Trump), was 
marked by feelings of extreme 
bewilderment, 
disbelief, 
fear, 

sadness and resolve to do more — 
to not be complacent in a regime 
of racism, to work doubly hard 
for civil rights for all, to protect 
and 
empower 
one 
another, 

and to get involved in civic 
life and civil disobedience and 
volunteering? These resolutions 
were so prevalent, among both 
liberals and moderates, as well 
as even a few Trump voters 
who realized the pain of their 
marginalized friends. They were 
almost ubiquitous that second 
week of November. It is now days 
into the Trump administration, 
and I’m asking you resolution-
makers: What have you done to 
fulfill 
these 
well-intentioned 

passionate promises to do better, 
to be better, to make change? 
What have I done?

It is so easy to talk about 

politics. 
I 
tweet 
about 
my 

frustrations about the political 
climate at least once per day, but 
confronting my tendency to talk 
rather than act is difficult. Social 
media can be a really powerful 
tool 
for 
organizing 
meetups 

and changing cultural norms. 
(Think: changing profile pictures 
to reflect support for marriage 
equality 
and 
organizing 

the 
Women’s 
March 
on 

Washington this January, both 
primarily via Facebook).

There 
is 
some 
evidence 

to support this form of “thin 
engagement” 
also 
sometimes 

termed “slacktivism” as a method 
for 
involving 
traditionally 

uninvolved 
communities 
in 

civic life, as well as promoting 
offline action from simply more 
acceptance and visibility of the 
LGBTQ community to putting 
boots on the ground. For example, 

social networks have contributed 
extensively to the structure of the 
Black Lives Matter movement, 
giving staying power, personal 
narrative and structure to an 
online and offline phenomenon. 
Black Lives Matter, however, 
and similar movements with an 
online presence are of a different 
order of coordinated magnitude 
than a Facebook post you push 
out to your typically like-minded 
friends or a snarky Tweet shared 
with a sympathetic audience.

The latter are not meaningful 

actions. Confusing these brief 
exchanges for something that will 
productively, actively contribute 
to safer lives for Americans is 
dangerous — it makes you feel 
like you’ve done something; it 
allows you to pat yourself on the 
back as a budding activist, and it 
ultimately will leave no minds 
changed and no lives improved.

Hillary 
Clinton 
won 
this 

election’s popular vote by nearly 
3 million votes. I’m not here to 
relitigate the election, but I am 
here to say that nearly 3 million 
more Americans of voting age 
are dissatisfied with the overtly 
discriminatory 
and 
nearly 

kleptocratic 
administration 

that just took office. If you 
consider yourself a member of 
this dissatisfied bunch (and you 
don’t need to be a Democrat or 
a liberal to do so), you’re not 
alone. Collective action is more 
important now than ever before.

If 
you 
made 
yourself 
a 

promise on Nov. 9, consider 
that the follow-through on that 
promise is not just for yourself 
but for the millions of non-
white, non-heterosexual, non-
cisgender, non-male, non-able 
bodied, 
immigrant, 
Muslim, 

lower-income and uninsured 
people (and every intersection 
between 
these 
groups 
and 

more). When you express your 
disdain for Trump or for any 
of the -isms or -phobias he 
espouses without taking action, 
you are not keeping good on 
these promises and you (and I) 

are betraying those who need 
us. We are betraying each other.

As former President Barack 

Obama stated back in 2014, “When 
citizens are free to organize and 
work together across borders to 
make our communities healthier, 
our environment cleaner, and 
our world safer, that’s when real 
change comes.” He also noted 
at his recent appearance in Ann 
Arbor the famous Brandeis quote, 
“the most important office ... is 
that of the private citizen.”

Let’s not be lazy in 2017. Let’s 

recognize the role that each one 
of us individually plays in our 
democracy. We are citizens and 
our civic action matters and it 
starts at home, with you and me. 
You should be informed about local 
and state politics — this is a place to 
make a change for the people you 
know and see every day. Educate 
others if you can — invite them 
to accompany you to city council 
meetings, get to the polls or call 
your 
representatives 
together. 

Talk with your family members 
and friends with whom you agree 
and disagree and learn, while 
standing up for others. You should 
be donating your time, if you are 
able, to both local organizations, 
regional 
chapters 
of 
national 

organizations 
and 
national 

organizations 
themselves 
that 

fight for women, against systemic 
racism, against homophobia and 
transphobia and for fair, just civil 
rights for all and an independent 
press. Do it with friends if you 
want. If you have the means to 
donate money, you can do that too.

And if you do all of that, or 

some of that, or any of that, it may 
become easier to sleep well at 
night. You can’t fight fascism on 
Facebook alone. But if you involve 
yourself in civic life, if you honestly 
commit yourself to a cause, if you 
keep good on your promise to the 
millions of people who need it, feel 
free to keep posting.

Go beyond what is ‘doable’

MILES MCGRUDER | COLUMN

A

fter about four and a half 
months 
of 
downtime 

following 
a 
rocket 

explosion during test 
operations, 
SpaceX 

returned to flight on 
Jan. 14.

The 
aggressive 

timeline 
SpaceX 

brings to the table is 
contrary to the other 
major space launch 
companies. 
Most 

of these companies 
respond 
extremely 

conservatively 
to 

the great risk of space launch. For 
instance, the European company 
Arianespace has been launching 
their Ariane 5 rocket since before 
I was born in 1997. The costs 
involved in each mission are so 
high that most companies would 
not dare endanger mission success 
in attempt to make improvements. 
This is obviously not the case 
with SpaceX, as it has released 
consistent and notable revisions to 
its Falcon 9 rocket. Thus, SpaceX 
has achieved great successes in a 
short time frame relative to the 
rest of the aerospace industry, 
where projects often take decades 
to complete.” It has also, of course, 
fallen short of the incredible 
reliability of Arianespace and 
other more traditional companies.

SpaceX is a classic example of 

when people or organizations are 
left with a choice. They can take 
the most reliable possible course 
of action until forced to change, 
or they can embrace inherently 
riskier 
constant 
change 
and 

improvement. The reliability route 
is clearly the road most traveled. I 
venture so far as to say the reliable 
road is the only sensible path to 
take for any person or group that 
values their well-being mentally 
and physically. We can only take 
the path of constant change when 
something other than the well-
being motivates us. This could 

be to fulfill a mission, for sheer 
enjoyment (strangely) or else 
something of the like. Based on 

its recent actions I am 
confident SpaceX is in a 
stage where it remains 
guided by the goal of 
its founder, Elon Musk, 
the creation of a self-
sustaining 
civilization 

on Mars. It requires 
incredible discipline to 
maintain loyalty to one’s 
original cause. Perhaps 
this is even impossible, 
change being the only 

constant.

The evolution of a company 

from 
young 
and 
mission-

driven 
to 
experienced 
with 

different motivations seems like 
an inevitable one. Over time, 
everyday operations cause things 
to slowly change and sight of the 
original goal is lost. The weight of 
short-term needs soon outweighs 
the grandeur of the original vision. 
The original, ideal ending is simply 
brought down by human nature 
itself: People in general default 
to doing what they need to do to 
survive optimally. We concentrate 
on the money, the fame, the power, 
the pleasure, whatever we meet 
on the way to the end goal and 
become distracted. From here the 
vision is done and the once-vibrant 
company, club, group or whatever 
it may be becomes something 
it was never meant to become. 
Whether the response is dismay 
or acquiescence it seems the result 
cannot be helped.

We see this common effect play 

out slowly in our everyday lives. 
We see it in our schooling, work, 
even hobbies. It takes a constant 
effort to counteract the negative 
change in attitude and remain 
fresh. I have seen individuals 
switch jobs frequently to avoid 
succumbing to boredom. People 
switch majors if the one they are 
pursuing 
becomes 
something 

they do not like. In schools, and, 
of course, here at the University of 
Michigan, countless organizations 
exist 
and 
are 
continuously 

created 
that 
ultimately 
help 

people 
counteract 
the 
slow 

negative change. Nonetheless, it is 
extremely difficult to stick to the 
plan long term.

This leads to the inevitable 

question: Is it at all worth 
trying to stick stubbornly to the 
outcome originally envisioned? 
It seems it would be necessary 
to align the stars in such a way 
that the natural tendencies for 
survival that break down grand 
plans instead help those plans 
along. If so, great sacrifices are 
needed to achieve whatever the 
original goal was. It is honestly 
probably better to let things run 
their course and be a part of 
the constant cycle of nascent 
hope and jaded maturity. I, of 
course, being relatively young, 
want to believe it is possible to 
break the cycle.

For no reason but this, I hope 

SpaceX succeeds. I hope Elon 
Musk gets his self-sustaining 
civilization on Mars because I 
want to see an exception to the 
rule ultimately succeed. I want 
to see that some “crazy” desire 
like wanting humans to live on 
Mars can be achieved despite 
sounding like a mission destined 
for failure. This would not only 
be another example of sticking 
to the vision of a major project 
in history, it would be a glaring, 
modern example that sticks in 
people’s minds. The successful 
return to flight is just one small 
step on this excruciatingly long 
and difficult journey, but I wish 
them the best.of a major project 
in history, it would be a glaring, 
modern example that sticks in 
people’s minds.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

I am currently 12 years away 

from turning 30. Perhaps that 
sounds 
like 
an 
outstanding 

amount of time, and while it is, 
I’m 18 years old. Time and time 
again, history has proven that 30 
years is more than enough time 
to change the world. Time and 
time again, we’ve had to watch 30 
years, such a young number, turn 
into a lifetime. We have seen this 
too many times in many artists 
who were able to produce life 
changing pieces of artwork before 
leaving this world suddenly — all 
before the age of 30.

My favorite book of all time, 

“Wuthering 
Heights,” 
was 

written by Emily Bronte, an 
English author who wrote only 
one novel before passing away 
in 1848 at the young age of 30. 
“Wuthering Heights” is now 
praised as a literary classic, 
despite its condemnation upon 
its original publication in 1847. 
The book was criticized for its 
vivid sexual power and passion, 
along 
with 
its 
controversial 

storyline during a time when 
villainizing men in literature was 
uncommon. It is one of the first 
stories ever published to follow 
a woman betrothed to one man 
and in love with another. Bronte’s 

revolutionary piece of literature 
paved the way for a new era of 
Gothic romance literature. One 
can only imagine what else she 
would have written had she 
survived the tuberculosis that 
took her from the world.

There are a multitude of 

examples 
of 
revolutionary 

artists passing away very young. 
Sylvia Plath, who died at age 30 
as well, also only published one 
novel (“The Bell Jar”) along with 
countless poems which have been 
compiled into poetry anthologies 
today. Her husband Ted Hughes 
claims she was working on 
another novel around the time 
of her death. Jimi Hendrix left 
us at age 27, poet John Keats 
was 25, Amy Winehouse was 27 
and Heath Ledger was 28. Such 
little time on Earth, yet what an 
impact they were able to make.

It’s difficult to think about 

how 
the 
world 
would 
be 

different if these artists were 
given more time to create their 
art. I wonder often what Bronte 
would have written next; if there 
would be a sequel about life 
on the Moors. I wonder if she 
would have rested her pen and 
written nothing more. I wonder 
if Amy Winehouse would have 
given us another album in her 
unmistakably raspy voice. If 
Heath Ledger would star in all 
the movies we watch or if he’d 
win 
another Oscar. 

It’s also difficult to wonder 

whether their art would have 
had the impact on the world 
that it does because they are 
not 
around 
anymore. 
How 

many 
more 
people 
bought 

Amy Winehouse’s music on 
iTunes, purchased “The Bell 
Jar” or watched “The Dark 
KNight” because these authors, 
musicians and actors are no 
longer around? It has become 
more alluring to stare at these 
people on the screen, listen 
to their voices and read their 
words because it is known that 
they are never going to portray 
a character, sing a song, write a 
word again.

Unfortunately, we will never 

know what could have happened 
had these artists lived for 
another 10 or 20 or 30 years. We 
must simply take the art they 
were able to give to us in the time 
they had and celebrate it. It is 
our job to take all the inspiration 
pent 
up 
into 
every 
single 

gorgeous page of “Wuthering 
Heights,” every single ounce of 
soul bleeding between the lines 
of “You Know I’m No Good,” 
every shouted whisper filling 
the cracks of “The Bell Jar” and 
use them to make our own art. 
We will never know what could 
have been, but we do know what 
is and what these people left us 
are our most treasured gifts, 
even if they left us soon after.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Japandroids’ 
third 
album 

Near to the Wild Heart of Life is a 
massive one, but packed into eight 
tracks. It’s at once a sprawling and 
cohesive listen, while each song 
still feels a bit different from the 
next. As sonically pleasing as the 
album is, it’s also boasts witty 
lyricism I found myself revisiting 
and reflecting on out of pure 
nostalgia. It’s an album that truly 
is accessible to fans of all genres. “A 
red ammo romance in the summer 
heat / in parks, on patios, and in 
the streets / Our mission: making 
moments into memories” is a line 
that simply demands old memories 
to bubble to the surface for listeners 
of any background.

On 
their 
third 
album, 

Japandroids 
have 
left 
behind 

their faster paced, lo-fi rock ‘n’ roll 
identity heard on 2012’s Celebration 
Rock for a more refined sound that 
reflects on natural songwriting 
progression. For a band consisting 
of 
only 
two 
individuals, 

Japandroids 
have 
impressively 

layered together sounds on tracks 
fit for full band performances.

As much as I hate to make 

the 
comparison, 
Japandroids’ 

progression as artists almost seems 
to mirror that of other alternative 
duo Twenty One Pilots — except 
Twenty One Pilots took a turn for 
a refined, faux-artsy aesthetic on 
their most recent release, while 
Japandroids decided to throw 
away their rules and continue to 
play to their strengths. Their songs 
are still about pursuing happiness 
and existing in contentment, while 
revamping and refining the way 
they put their sounds together into 
a work of art.

Contextually, Near to the Wild 

Heart of Life feels essential in 

today’s social climate. The chorus 
of the track is a rollicking shout 
for expression, with David Prowse 
singing: “And it got me all fired 
up / to go far away / and make 
some music from the sound of my 
singing, baby.” It feels like an album 
that not only matters, but entirely 
understands its audience. Much 
of the lyricism on the album falls 
under this theme — just existing 
in the world and having a right to 
existing how you want to.

The album’s little tweaks to 

individual 
songs 

make for a fresh, 
dynamic 
listen. 

“True Love and a 
Free Life of Free 
Will” is a track that 
sounds big, pulling 
from 
the 
indie 

acoustics similar to 
Noah and the Whale, 
and it expertly feeds 
into the unexpectedly shoegazey 
“I’m Sorry (For Not Finding You 
Sooner).” The album is distinctly, 
very much Japandroids, while 
utilizing genre influences that 
add a lot of depth to the entirety 
of its run. In an interview with 
Pitchfork, 
drummer/vocalist 

Brian King said: “We’re removing 
all the self-imposed rules that led 
to the songs and the sound of our 
whole career up until now,” and 
Japandroids showcase their fine-
tuned changes within their unique 
tone throughout the album.

The seven minute centerpiece of 

the album, “Arc of Bar,” recognizes 
Japandroids’ penchant for writing 
melodies that exude belonging, 
becoming perfectly catchy tunes 
for singing along with friends. 
You know that scene in “The 
Perks of Being a Wallflower” 
where “Heroes” by David Bowie is 
playing, and Sam is standing up in 
the back of the pickup truck while 
they’re driving through a highway 
tunnel? “Arc of Bar” flawlessly 

recreates the contentment of that 
scene. Like the rest of the album, it 
just feels so right.

Throughout the album, most 

of the melody is dependent on 
vocals, interspersed with funky 
synth lines that, again, add to 
the refined changes Japandroids 
weave into the album. Gang vocals 
on choruses add to the accessibility 
of the album, bringing the spotlight 
to the formidability of their 
songwriting capabilities. In the 
Pitchfork interview, King also said 

they’re 
“trying 

to figure out how 
to be intense in 
different 
ways,” 

a 
sentiment 

which 
perfectly 

manifests 
itself 

in 
the 
album. 

Japandroids have 
toned down their 
in-your-face, fast 

tempo rock tracks while keeping 
their emotional intensity. They’ve 
found subtle ways to continue 
to make music that demands 
attention in their evolving style, 
one that isn’t overtly positive or 
loud, but always hints at hope.

The final track, “In a Body 

Like a Grave,” opens with this 
insane gut punch of a line: 
“Christ will call you out / school 
will deepen doubt / work will 
sap the soul / hometown haunts 
what’s left.” In a beautiful list 
of common human experiences 
— from religion to moving away 
from home — Japandroids 
effectively encapsulate the heart 
and soul of their new album. It’s 
wonderfully human to the core, 
a sentiment that might seem 
corny, but in practice, makes for 
music that is desirable to listen 
to. It’s human to need belonging, 
and Japandroids extrapolate this 
need into an album that is almost 
entirely enjoyable from front to 
back.

ANTI-

Just 
last 
week, 
it 
was 

announced that Louis Vuitton 
and Supreme were to collaborate 
for Louis Vuitton’s A/W 2017 
collection. This was something 
that 
I 
simultaneously 
never 

expected to happen, but also saw 
as inevitable.

Streetwear has gone from a 

subcultural movement to the 
mainstream. While his name may 
not ring a bell to some, James 
Jebbia has taken streetwear’s 
golden child, Supreme, from 
the shadows to the forefront of 
fashion. Supreme is one of the 
most popular brands in the world 
at the moment, and there are 
few brands with as much staying 
power as Louis Vuitton. The 
French fashion house is the type 
of brand that many young people 
grow up aspiring towards, while 
Supreme is the type of brand 
that a young demographic has 
flocked to over the years. What 
better way to tie the younger 
audience to a brand like Louis V 
(and the opposite, as well) than a 
collaboration between these two 
brands?

From 
duffle 
bags 
and 

backpacks to box logo tees and 
jackets, this collection features 
items to attract frequent Louis 
Vuitton customers and passionate 
Supreme 
supporters 
alike. 

Supreme is a brand known for 
boasting severely excess demand 
on many of their releases: Box 
logos 
and 
collaboration 
tees 

sell out in seconds and then 
go up on sites like Grailed at a 
five-times markup. I imagine 
this collaboration won’t be any 
different.

Thinking about how much a 

box logo Supreme tee with the 
LV monogram will resell for 
simply blows my mind. Hell, I’d 
bet that the baseball bats with 
the monogram grip will fly off the 

shelves too. While there are many 
people who buy Supreme because 
they have grown up in skateboard 
culture, there are so many 
people who buy Supreme for the 
exclusivity, and there really isn’t 
another word that describes Louis 
Vuitton better than exclusive.

The 
reason 
why 
this 

collaboration makes so much 
sense to me is the motivations 
behind the consumers of each 
brand. For those who don’t know, 
when Supreme releases a box logo 
tee, things tend to get a bit out of 
hand. While some profit-seeking 
individuals buy them to resell 
online, the reason why the people 
who decide to wear them are so 
passionate about getting their 
hands on a box logo is the fact 
that it represents the pinnacle of 
the brand’s exclusivity. Wearing 
a box logo is a way of displaying 
one’s location in the hierarchical 
ecosystem of Supreme consumers. 
Maybe it’s because it tells others 
that the $500 profit that could 
have been realized by selling 
the shirt online means less than 
being able to wear the shirt, or 
that spending $600 on a T-shirt 
doesn’t mean anything. I think 
that a Louis Vuitton bag says 
something very similar.

Maybe I’m a bit jaded, but I 

doubt that everyone with a LV 
bag simply adores the monogram. 
Instead, I think that many people 
have the bags because of the 
inaccessibility. 
The 
decision 

systems that customers of both 
Supreme and Louis Vuitton utilize 
are very similar, and while the 
brand’s demographics may not 
completely align, this may be 
the kind of collaboration that 
is worth taking out a payday 
advance for an avid Supreme 
fan.

ALBUM REVIEW


6A — Monday, January 23, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

‘Fire at Sea’ focuses on obscure 
Italian adolescent over crisis

With more emphasis on the daily life of a young boy, the otherwise 
shocking footage of North African refugees feels secondary

The first The xx album was 

one of the best self-contained 
releases of the last decade. 
It’s a record with a sound 
that appeared to come from 
nowhere. There was no larger 
media narrative and no grand 
purpose — just a series of sounds 
that seemed to line up in perfect 
sequence with each other.

2009’s xx is an album without 

a single wasted note. It’s a quiet 
work that never overplays its 
hand, with only three musicians 
working in harmony with mini-
mal overdubs. They used empty 
space to their advantage more 
than any other band, keeping the 
guitar riffs light and the vocals 
shy. The most sprawling, epic 
track xx offers is still only a two-
minute intro instrumental.

Yes, The xx arrived completely 

formed, fully mature and totally 
compelling. Yet, there was some 
nervousness about the group’s 
future. If you make a perfect, 
tight, mistake-free record at the 
beginning of your career, where 
do you go from there?

The closest analogue to The 

xx had already suffered a worri-
some fate. New York City’s Inter-
pol, one of the leaders of the city’s 
then-revitalized guitar scene that 
also included The Strokes and 
Yeah Yeah Yeahs, put out Turn on 
the Bright Lights in 2002 to criti-
cal acclaim and fanfare.

Like xx, Turn on the Bright 

Lights is a moody, lonely, unmis-
takably modern record. It hides 
its feelings behind obscure lyrics 
and fine-tunes its instrumental 
arrangements to achieve awe-
inspiring efficiency. While Inter-
pol is more traditionally “rock” 
than The xx, both bands’ debuts 
are melancholy masterpieces.

Once a band hits a perfect for-

mula, it’s hard to improve. Inter-
pol followed up Bright Lights 
with 2004’s Antics, a very good 
album that nonetheless feels like 
Bright Lights, Part Two. There’s 
nothing especially wrong with it, 
but it lacks a spark, because we 
have heard all these songs before.

However, attempts to expand 

on the band’s signature sound 
fell flat, first with 2007’s Our 
Love to Admire and then with 
two more follow-up records. 
Greater ambitions and a desire 
for a more “epic” scale to their 
songs opened the band up to mis-
steps and songs filled with hot 
air, which were both antithetical 
to what made Interpol great. The 
band never solved the problem of 
how to evolve, stay great and stay 
true to themselves all at the same 
time.

The xx seemed to be follow-

ing the exact same blueprint, as 
2012’s Coexist follows a similar 
path as Antics. Coexist is a most-
ly forgettable rehash of all the 
sounds that made The xx great in 
the first place. It’s a record that 
continues to see the musicians 
do what they’re most talented at, 
but — particularly with its lack of 
well-crafted melodies — Coexist 
never gives a listener much rea-
son to choose it over xx.

At least for this fan, there were 

questions about whether The xx 
would even continue after Coex-
ist. In the years following, the 
group’s lone non-singing member 
— Jamie xx — made a name for 
himself as a solo electronic artist.

2015’s In Colour was a breath 

of fresh air for both Jamie and 
the genre of electronic music. xx 
perfectly captured the vibes of a 
night out in London, balancing 
hard-hitting beats on tracks like 
“Gosh” with more meditative, 
slow-burn songs that showed 
an unusual patience for main-
stream EDM. Plus, the joyful 

Young Thug collaboration “Good 
Times” was the indie fan’s song 
of the summer. As the accolades 
poured in, it became easy to think 
of The xx as one of Jamie’s early 
projects and not his main gig.

But In Colour might actually 

be what saved The xx, because 
earlier this month, a revitalized-
sounding group dropped the 
incredible I See You. It’s a record 
that seems to take everything 
Jamie xx learned while making 
his solo album and seamlessly 
blends it with what made The xx 
already great.

I See You still features the 

unmatched vocal chemistry of 
Oliver Sim and Romy Madley 
Croft, but now there are synthet-
ic horns, piano loops and drum 
tracks programmed for dance-
floor movement. In all, the new 
record sounds like a fresh, fun 
remix album of The xx’s debut. 
It’s an exhilarating reinvention, 
and The xx likely wouldn’t have 
found the key to breaking the 
formula if they hadn’t spent that 
time apart.

“xx seemed to exist infinitely 

in hushed, empty spaces — void 
of vitality and shrouded in shad-
ows,” wrote Daily music writer 
Shima Sadaghiyani in her review 
of the latest The xx album. “In 
contrast … I See You, bursts with 
color.”

There’s a much-too-easy In 

Colour pun to be made here, but 
in truth, that’s exactly what The 
xx needed. The new album solves 
what was once the band’s only 
problem, allowing them to take 
risks and evolve without betray-
ing their talents. The xx are still 
tight, fully formed and mature, 
but they now have an extra 
dimension added onto their sig-
nature sound. They have stepped 
out of a crisp, minimal black-
and-white world and entered a 
dynamic new era of dizzying 
possibilities.

The xx as a multi-dimensional force

LAUREN THEISEN 
Daily Music Columnist

To call “Fire at Sea,” the 

latest 
documentary 
from 

Italian director Gianfranco 
Rosi 
(“Sacro 
GRA”), 
a 

film 
about 
the 
European 

immigration 
crisis 
would 

be a misnomer. Yes, there 
are refugees from Northern 
Africa 
and 

yes, 
their 

heartbreaking 
and often deadly 
journeys 
are 

captured in the 
film, but Rosi’s 
documentary is 
more a series of 
direct 
cinema 

observations 
about 
Lampedusa, 
the 
Sicilian 

island 
at 
which 
many 

arrive, rather than a well-
argued case for tolerance for 
immigrants.

For as much time as the 

refugees 
are 
afforded 
on 

screen — which in the grand 
scheme of things is not all 
that much — the individual 
with the most screen time is a 
young boy, Samuele, a native 
Lampedusa resident with a 
lazy eye who spends much 
of his time playing with his 
toy slingshot. Samuele never 
interacts with the refugees, 
whose trials and tribulations 
as they flee from their war-
torn homelands are reserved 
off-screen or in oral history. 
But the refugees’ haunting 
presence abides. As Samuele 
climbs a tree to saw off a 
bit of wood, or places tiny 
explosives in a row of cacti 
with his friend, or gets his 
eyes examined, it’s impossible 

not to think of the refugees, 
only miles from this sheltered 
adolescent.

But that the refugees — at 

the center of a challenging 
geopolitical 
dilemma 
that 

requires smart filmmaking 
— are only one facet of this 
distracted film is exactly 
Rosi’s 
problem. 
His 
lack 

of focus and the loose ties 
between the various threads 
that guide the film through 

its 
two-hour 

run time deride 
the film from 
making any sort 
of 
meaningful 

statement 
on 

the subject. The 
fuocoammare 
(“fire 
at 
sea” 

in 
Italian) 

captured 
by 

his 
camera 

is 
multifaceted. 
The 
film 

depicts how the residents 
of Lampedusa, new and old, 
relate to the Mediterranean 
Sea. For the refugees, the sea 
was simultaneously a channel 
of escape and a major threat — 
many died from dehydration 
or overcrowding on makeshift 
rubber boats.

For the older residents 

of the island, memories of 
World War II battles on 
the sea looms like the dark 
clouds that muddle the sun’s 
rays. For others, including 
a radio DJ intermittently 
visited, “Fire at Sea” refers 
to an old song, and to others, 
the inclement weather that 
prevents the fishing industry, 
the primary industry of the 
island, from succeeding. A 
general sense of terror on 
boats plagues Samuele, our 
young protagonist, as he gets 
seasick on one occasion and 
loses control of a rowboat on 

another.

But the refugee crisis is just 

one part of many. We never 
see refugees on their way to 
Europe or how citizens of the 
island treat them. We see their 
rescue, their “registration” 
and documentation processes 
orchestrated 
by 
Italian 

officials. We see a meeting 
between a pregnant refugee 
and a doctor. We see a 
makeshift soccer competition, 
in which refugees from each 
country band together to 
compete in a miniature world 
cup. And we see a heart-
wrenching recanting of one 
group’s journey, from Nigeria 
to the Sahara to Libya and 
finally to Lampedusa.

When Rosi fixes his camera 

on the refugees, “Fire at Sea” 
feels like the most relevant 
and powerful documentary 
in ages. Nearly every image 
of the refugees is visually 
arresting. Italian authorities, 
at first, treat the refugees 
like 
diseased 
specimens, 

with gloves and facemasks. 
The refugees are cloaked in 
gold foil, which shimmers 
in the nighttime light like a 
gown at a bourgeoisie gala. 
When he focuses on the other 
residents, which happens all 
too often, the film feels overly 
long and, ultimately, like a 
dud.

Still, Rosi, like his Italian 

contemporaries (see: Paolo 
Sorrentino 
(“Youth”) 
and 

Luca Guadagnino (“A Bigger 
Splash”)), has nailed down 
a breathtaking visual style. 
His filmmaking is intrepid, 
following divers underwater 
or 
tracing 
the 
nighttime 

searchlights 
on 
the 
open 

sea. If the context weren’t 
so devastating, Rosi’s images 
would be beyond enchanting.

FILM REVIEW


Just 
10 
days 
ago, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team faced Illinois and suffered 
a humiliating 16-point defeat in 
Champaign, 85-69. Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein admitted 
Friday that the 
Fighting 
Illini 
opened up a “can 
of whooping” on 
the Wolverines, 
as it was the only 
Big 
Ten 
game 
that they were 
really out of by 
the 
halftime 
break this year.
Illinois’s trio of big men — 
center Maverick Morgan and 
forwards Kipper Nichols and 
Leron Black — did most of the 
damage that night, scoring 16, 
13 and 10 points, respectively. 
After 
the 
game, 
Morgan 
added insult to injury, calling 
Michigan 
a 
“white-collar 
team”.
In the time since, Michigan 
defeated Nebraska at home and 
nearly upset Wisconsin on the 
road. Meanwhile, the Fighting 
Illini have been on the ropes, 
losing a close home game to 
Maryland and then getting 
blown out at Purdue.
On Saturday afternoon, the 
two teams were set for 
a 
highly-anticipated 
rematch at Crisler 
Center. Before 
the 
game, 
senior 
wing 
Zak 

Irvin approached the team 
equipment manager and asked 
if the Wolverines could don 
their blue away jerseys instead 
of their traditional home white.
While redshirt sophomore 
forward 
DJ 
Wilson 
took 
Morgan’s 
comments 
in 
stride 
Friday, 
asserting 
that 
Michigan didn’t 
feel 
the 
need 
to 
prove 
that 
it was a tough 
team, even he 
admitted 
after 
the game that 
the slight put a 
“chip on their 
shoulder”.
That chip was 
clearly evident Saturday, as 
the Wolverines took the court 
in 
their 
“blue-collar” 
uniforms and sent a 
very clear message 
to Illinois (2-5 Big 
Ten, 12-8 overall). 
Adopting 
the 
aggressive 
defensive 
mindset 
Morgan claimed 
they 
lacked, 
Michigan 
(3-4, 
13-7) avenged its 
blowout loss and 
earned 
a 

66-57 victory.
While the Fighting Illini 
went off, shooting 64 percent 
from both the floor and from 
three in the first contest, 
the Wolverines held Illinois 
to 45 percent shooting from 
the field and just 28 percent 
shooting 
from 
distance 
Saturday. Instead of allowing 
49 first-half points like it did 
in game one, Michigan kept the 
Fighting Illini under 25 points 
at the break. 
With a strategy centered on 
physicality and help defense on 
the low block, the Wolverines 
shut down Illinois’ three big 
men who had been so dominant 
in Champaign. While the trio 
racked up 39 combined points 
that night, they amassed just 14 
on Saturday.
“I 

thought we were really much 
more aggressive than we were 
at their place in guarding the 
post,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “… When they went in 
there, they did get some shots, 
but we made them earn them.”
Keeping the Fighting Illini 
out 
of 
their 
sweet 
spots, 
especially the mid-range jump 
shot, Michigan turned Illinois’ 
big men into liabilities, as 
they turned the ball over six 
times. The Wolverines also 
forced them into foul trouble, 
limiting their minutes on the 
court. Morgan, Nichols and 
Black played just 22, 17 and 13 
minutes, respectively.
Nichols, 
in 
particular, 
terrorized Michigan on the 
offensive glass in Champaign, 
pulling down five boards as the 
Fighting Illini 
scored 
10 
second-
chance 
points. 
But 
Wilson 
assumed 
that role 
in 
the 

rematch, notching six offensive 
rebounds which the Wolverines 
used to gain a 14-6 edge in the 
second-chance points battle. 
During a 13-3 run from the 
14-minute mark to the six-
minute mark of the first half 
— in which Michigan opened 
up a nine-point lead and began 
to pull away from Illinois — 
Wilson scored 10 points, all of 
which came off 
offensive boards.
He kicked off 
the stretch by 
grabbing a long 
rebound 
and 
knocking down a 
3-pointer, before 
adding a couple 
of putback layups 
in 
traffic 
on 
which he drew 
fouls. His most 
impressive points, though, came 
when he threw down a massive 
putback slam that surely belongs 
on the highlight reel.
“I thought they beat 
us up pretty good on the 
glass, and obviously DJ 
Wilson 
spearheaded 
that,” 
said Illinois coach John Groce. 
“I thought he was absolutely 
terrific today. ... His energy 
level on the backboard (and) his 
willingness to make the extra 
pass and make his team better.”
By the end of the first half, 
the Wolverines had officially 
turned 
the 
tables 
on 
the 
Fighting Illini, taking a 34-24 
lead into the break. Michigan 
never looked back from there. 
The Wolverines could have 
taken their foot off the gas, 
but they kept it on full 
throttle.
Irvin 
and 
senior 
guard 
Derrick 
Walton Jr. 

carried 
the 
scoring 
burden 
alongside 
Wilson’s 
19-point 
performance, tallying 11 and six 
points, respectively, in the second 
half.
The 
duo, 
who 
also 
took 
Morgan’s dig personally, made 
Illinois look silly on a couple 
of possessions. First, Walton 
crossed over Morgan before 
laying it up and drawing a foul, 
and then Irvin 
drove down the 
baseline with a 
stop-start move 
to blow past his 
defender 
and 
convert 
at 
the 
rim.
By that point, 
Michigan 
had 
a 21-point lead 
with six minutes 
remaining. 
Though the Wolverines gave 
up 18 points while sinking six 
free throws down the stretch, 
the Fighting Illini never posed a 
serious threat.
Michigan entered the rematch 
eager to make a statement, 
and that’s exactly what the 
Wolverines did.
As Wilson made clear after the 
game: “We weren’t the white-
collar team today.”

Wolverines split exhibitions to open their season

Senior 
goaltender 
Robbie 

Zenino set up for a shot from a 
Marquette attacker, his knees bent 
and pole over his right shoulder. 
With the ball ripping towards him, 
he dipped and extended his arms 
toward the bottom left corner of 
the goal, catching the attempt in 
the safety of his stick.

Zenino isn’t the usual face in 

front of the net. Last year, that was 
Gerald Logan, who transferred to 
Johns Hopkins University during 
the offseason. Logan’s move is 
one of a series of departures that 
shuffled the core of the Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team. But on this 
particular play, Zenino made the 
same save that Logan would have, 
as well.

The Wolverines, surrounded 

by question marks, began its sixth 
season Saturday with exhibitions 
against Marquette and Denison at 
Oosterbaan Fieldhouse.

In the first matchup, after a 

back-and-forth battle saw the 
18th-ranked Golden Eagles take 
a 15-12 lead with five minutes to 
play, sophomore attacker Brent 
Noseworthy and senior midfielder 
Mikie Schlosser scored a pair of 
goals, closing the lead to one with 
just over 15 seconds remaining. 
But an inconclusive faceoff and 
the strong play of Marquette 
defenders ran the clock out, and 
Michigan failed to complete the 
comeback.

“The great thing about getting 

to play in an exhibition like this 
is we get to use it as a learning 
opportunity — it’s not going on 
our record,” said Michigan coach 
John Paul. “We have some things 
we need to do better — we know 
that — but we gave ourselves a shot 
at the end, and that shows a lot of 
grit.”

A 
scoring 
battle 
between 

Noseworthy 
and 
the 
Golden 

Eagles’ Tanner Thomson proved 
to be the highlight of the afternoon 
— each scored five times to break 
ties at critical points in the game. 

The Wolverines got off to a fast 

start, scoring five goals early in 
the first period. The team limited 
Marquette’s opportunities thanks 
to physical defending, including 
a resounding hit by redshirt 

sophomore goaltender Tommy 
Heidt in front of his own net.

But the Golden Eagles would 

get their revenge on the starting 
goalie later in the frame, knocking 
him off his feet and outside the 
vicinity of his crease, leading to 
retaliation from defenders and 
a Michigan penalty. Though no 
conversion came on the man-
advantage, the hit on Heidt proved 
to shift momentum in the game, as 
a 4-0 run ensued.

“Managing (runs) for your team 

is just about making the next play,” 
Paul said. “Managing the other 
team’s runs is something we’ve 
been more concerned about the 
last couple of years. We haven’t 
been great at that.”

In the Wolverines’ second 

game, many reserves saw action 
in a low-scoring, shortened affair. 
Only three periods were played 
in a game that ended in a 7-6 
Michigan victory.

Freshman 
goaltender 
Matt 

Trowbridge 
was 
especially 

impressive early, making two 
remarkable saves, including one 
off a tough bouncing attempt and 
another off a point-blank effort 
from the left side of the crease.

Heidt, Trowbridge and Zenino 

have 
battled 
throughout 
the 

fall and winter for the role that 
Logan occupied for the past three 
seasons.

“I think it’s going to be a 

week-to-week thing this year, to 
be honest with you,” Paul said. 
“I’d love to just be able to make a 
decision, but all three are playing 
at a pretty high level in practice. 
Nobody’s separated themselves, so 
that’s what we’re waiting to see.”

Heidt surrendered 11 goals in 

three periods of action, while 
Zenino gave up four in the final 
15 minutes against Marquette. 
In the Wolverines’ second game, 
Trowbridge allowed just two 
scores in two frames.

“I would have love to see (Heidt) 

play a little better for the first 
three, he’s been playing great in 
practice,” Paul said. “I thought 
he was dipping his stick a little bit 
and giving up some stuff up high. 
I thought (Zenino) came in the 
fourth quarter and did a pretty nice 
job. He made a couple key saves 
to give us an opportunity to come 
back there. We still have a battle.”

Michigan will also miss the 

contributions of the program’s all-
time leading scorer, Kyle Jackson 
— the seventh overall selection 

in the 2016 NLL Draft. But the 
Wolverines welcomed back senior 
attacker Ian King, who sits 20 
goals away from Jackson’s record 
despite struggling with injuries 
over the past two seasons. King got 
off to a strong start, notching two 
goals in the second half against 
Marquette. 

“If I break (the record), it would 

be an honor, but I’m more focused 
on the team winning,” King said. 
“I’d love to see wins come. If the 
points come with it, then I’ll be 
happy, too.”

Despite the team’s inexperience 

following 
the 
graduations 
of 

the Wolverines’ first recruiting 
class, King, Zenino and the rest 
of Michigan’s second recruiting 
class gives Paul confidence in the 
program’s future.

“They’re really focused on 

turning this program into an elite, 
Division I culture — that’s been 
their mission all year,” Paul said. 
“They want to leave this team 
competitive in the Big Ten and 
in a place where the next group 
of leaders stepping in has a much 
easier job in front of them — a team 
primed to do the things that need 
to be done to compete at a high 
level.”

It’s personal for Zak Irvin

F

or as long as he has been 
one of the leaders and de 
facto spokesmen for the 

Michigan men’s basketball team, 
Zak Irvin 
has never 
hesitated 
to use any 
emotion as 
motivation.

Two 

years ago, 
when Irvin 
stepped 
into his role 
as a go-to 
player for the Wolverines, the 
Fishers, Ind., native admitted after 
scoring 23 points in Bloomington: 
“Going into this game, this was a 
personal one for me.”

Last February, after Michigan 

State and Indiana dealt Michigan 
consecutive, embarrassing 
blowouts at Crisler Center, Irvin 
minced no words: “You’ve got 
them laughing at us on our home 
court,” he said. “In these past two 
games, teams have just punked us, 
and we can’t let that happen.”

And then, after the Wolverines 

trounced Southern Methodist 
to win the 2K Sports Classic 
and avenged ugly defeats to the 
Mustangs in the previous two 
years, Irvin vowed: “The last loss 
we had to them, we basically got 
punked throughout the whole 
game, and we knew we weren’t 
going to let that happen this 
game.”

More fodder for another chip 

on Irvin’s shoulder came along 
last week, and you didn’t have to 
look hard to find it. After Illinois 
ran up 85 points to drop Michigan 
to 1-3 in the Big Ten, Fighting 
Illini center Maverick Morgan 
slighted the Wolverines, calling 
them “more of a white-collar team 
traditionally.”

Michigan coach John Beilein 

insisted the Wolverines “do not 
have a bunch of white-collar 
kids.” Junior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman added, “I 

especially don’t like that.”

But the first player to speak 

up, two days after the game, was 
Irvin.

“We’ll see them again,” the 

senior vowed.

Saturday, Michigan did. And 

the Wolverines blitzed Illinois, 
winning Saturday at Crisler 
Center in a game not nearly 
as close as the 66-57 score 
indicated. Michigan (3-4 Big 
Ten, 13-7 overall) has plenty of 
work to do to make the NCAA 
Tournament, but for at least one 
day, the Wolverines proved their 
toughness and their grit. 

In large part, that mindset 

stems from Irvin. The senior 
captain has long established 
himself as one of the leaders of 

the team, and he plays that role 
more emotionally than anything 
else. When Michigan goes on a 
scoring run, Irvin 
is among the most 
enthusiastic. 
When the 
Wolverines get 
“punked,” Irvin 
is usually the first 
to implore them 
to do something 
about it. In this 
case, while most 
of the players saw 
the “white-collar” 
comment in one 
way or another, junior forward DJ 
Wilson said Irvin showed the most 
urgency about it toward the rest of 
the team.

“Zak kind of just lets us know 

what was said and how we’re 
going to go about it the next time,” 

Wilson said 
Friday. “… Him as 
our leader, I think 
he’s just kind of 
just watching out 
for us and trying 
to get us ready as 
much as we can 
and prepare for 
them.”

Irvin made 

it clear how he 
wanted his team 
to approach 

the rematch against Illinois. In 
response to Morgan’s dig after 
last week’s game, Irvin had the 
idea of wearing road uniforms 

at home. The reason was simple: 
Morgan called the Wolverines 
white-collar, so they wore blue 
jerseys — “just to switch it up a 
little bit,” Irvin said.

The satisfaction in Irvin’s 

voice of having the last laugh was 
palpable. Illinois’ first shot was 
sweet, Michigan’s answer much 
sweeter. Irvin has always talked 
about the mental aspect of the 
game. He has lost 45 games in his 
college career. But the blowouts 
and the laughing and the insults, 
those seem to sting much more.

As the Wolverines look to climb 

out of this hole and inch back into 
the NCAA Tournament, they 
could use a fiery leader — or two or 
three — like Irvin.

“Teammates and coaches told 

me they notice that the team feeds 
off of me and the intensity that I 
bring,” Irvin said. “So I try to bring 
that no matter how I’m playing 
on the offensive end. I know I can 
always bring emotion to the team 
and get us going, and I did that 
a little bit today. But like I said, I 
really feel like DJ set the tone and 
carried us today.”

Saturday, with the help of 

Irvin, Wilson (19 points, seven 
rebounds, five assists) and senior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. (13 
points, 11 rebounds), Michigan 
did what good teams do. The 
Wolverines came out on their 
home court with much more 
energy and outplayed Illinois 
almost wire to wire.

It’s worth noting that Irvin’s 

performance Saturday was 
statistically the least impressive 
of those three. He needed 15 shots 
to score 15 points and turned 
the ball over four times with no 
assists. But as he has proven many 
times before, he can influence the 
game with his intensity perhaps 
more than anything else. He 
admitted after the game that this 
performance meant a little more 
to him.

“When a team’s beat you and 

you get another opportunity to 
play ’em, you definitely want to 
take it personally,” Irvin said. 
“You really never want to get 
swept with that team in the 
regular season.”

Michigan allowed just 24 points 

in the first half and led by as many 
as 21. The Wolverines “punked” 
the Fighting Illini. They might as 
well have been laughing on their 
own home court.

They still have a long road back 

to the NCAA Tournament, but 
it continues Thursday night in 
primetime against Indiana, Irvin’s 
hometown team. That’s a personal 
one for him, remember.

Senior wing Zak Irvin has always been an emotional leader for the Wolverines, and they will need that if they hope to return to the NCAA Tournament this year.

King scores to help ‘M’ 
beat No. 18 Marquette 

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

lacrosse team trailed 11-10 in 
its exhibition game Saturday 
against No. 18 
Marquette. The 
Wolverines 
desperately 
needed a spark 
late 
in 
the 

contest.

With 
one 

flick of senior 
attacker 
Ian 

King’s stick, he 
tied the game 
at 11. And with 
10.3 seconds left in the third 
period, he added another goal, 
giving Michigan a 12-11 lead 
heading into the final quarter.

Being an offensive spark 

plug is nothing new for King, 
who has tallied 68 goals and 29 
assists through his first three 
seasons for Michigan. It is 
not the most significant thing 
expected of him, though.

“If he’s leading and he’s letting 

the game come 
to him and being 
a steadying force 
on our offense 
and not ‘the guy’ 
on our offense, 
we’re going to 
be 
in 
pretty 

good 
shape,” 

said 
Michigan 

coach John Paul. 
“There’s going to 
be times where 
we need him to 
be ‘the guy’, but that can’t be his 
mindset day in, day out. We want 
to take that pressure off him and 
just have him play lacrosse.”

Kyle Jackson served in that 

role for Michigan last season 
before being drafted seventh 
overall 
by 
the 
Rochester 

Knighthawks 
in 
the 
2016 

National 
Lacrosse 
League 

Draft. He left the program as 

the all-time leading scorer, 
with 113 points. While King 
claims filling Jackson’s shoes 
will be a collective effort, the 
reality is that King is the most 
notable returner. With another 

full 
season 

ahead of him, 
King 
needs 

just 16 points 
to 
shatter 

Jackson’s 
record. 
Still, 

the Wolverines’ 
staff is hoping 
he assumes a 
role as a leader 
more 
than 
a 

scorer.

“I think we have a lot of good 

freshmen that are coming in 
and filling spots,” King said. 
“We lost a lot of points with 
Kyle Jackson, but if there is any 
added responsibility (for me), 
I’ll take it, but I don’t think 
there is.”

Added Paul: “He’s matured. 

He’s become a little more of a 
leader this year, which is what 
we need from him. You need 

your best player 
to lead. … He’s 
just 
worked 

really hard to 
set 
a 
better 

example.”

Entering his 

final 
season, 

King 
can 

likely 
surpass 

Jackson’s 
school 
record. 

But as for his 
ultimate 
goal, 

King said he wants to win 
the Big Ten Tournament and 
advance to postseason play 
for the first time in program 
history.

“If I break (the record), it 

would be an honor, but I’m more 
focused on the team winning.” 
King said. “I’d love to see wins 
come. If the points come with 
it, I’ll be happy too.”

Michigan dominated at Illinois

After 
forfeiting 
the 
125-

pound matchup for the third 
meet in a row, the Michigan 
wrestling team began its dual 
meet against Illinois in a hole 
before it even had a wrestler on 
the mat.

And 
the 
night 
hardly 
 

improved from there for the 
Wolverines, whose 34-6 defeat 
at the hands of the 12th-ranked 
Fighting Illini (2-2 Big Ten, 4-2 
overall) 
matched 
Michigan’s 

worst dual meet loss since 
the 
2009-2010 
season. 
The 

loss dropped the 15th-ranked 
Wolverines to 1-4 in the highly 
competitive Big Ten — each 
loss coming against a team 
ranked 18th or better. Its stretch 
of 
conference 
play 
doesn’t 

bode well for Michigan, with 
matchups against No. 11 Rutgers 
and No. 17 Wisconsin still to 
come.

“I feel we could have wrestled 

better,” said Michigan coach Joe 
McFarland. “I think we need to 
be a little more consistent. We 
never got any momentum on our 
side, and it snowballed against 
us.”

The freshman trio of Logan 

Massa, Stevan Micic and Myles 
Amine — who have been so 
integral 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 

success thus far this season — 
all lost their matchups by three 
points or fewer. Before Friday’s 
meet, the three athletes held a 
combined record of 48-5.

McFarland 
acknowledged 

the challenge of going on the 
road against a quality Big Ten 
opponent with a team so reliant 
on young talent.

But Sal Profaci, a redshirt 

freshman in his own right, 
doesn’t buy that excuse. Profaci 
— who competes in the 141-
pound class — was one of just 
two Wolverines to win his 
individual matchup. 

“We’re not waiting until next 

year to let us decide we’re going 
to be a top-tier team,” Profaci 

said. “We want to do that this 
year.”

Coming into the meet, No. 

2 Massa’s matchup with No. 1 
Isaiah Martinez figured to be the 
marquee event, and potentially 
the key to a Michigan victory. 
Instead, it was just another 
Wolverine loss to pile on to the 
cakewalk Illinois had previously 
established.

Massa fell behind after a 

high-crotch takedown at the 
end of the first period, and 
despite 
aggressive 
attempts, 

failed to make up the difference 
in the third period.

But McFarland believes it 

could be a learning experience 
that could prepare Massa for a 
potential rematch between the 
two.

“It was good for (Massa) to 

see him, because he’s going 
to continue to see him down 
the road — whether it’s at the 
(Big Ten Championships) or at 
(the NCAA Championships),” 
 

McFarland 
said 
“… 
A 
guy 

like (Martinez) is a quality 
opponent, and it came down to 

one takedown at the end of the 
first period and that was the 
difference in the match.”

Fortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, they may not be 
forced to overcome an early 
deficit due to forfeit much 
longer. They have dealt with 
multiple ACL injuries at the 
weight class, but McFarland 
says reinforcement is on the way. 
Senior Conor Youtsey, a two-
time All-American, weighed in 
for the match and is expected to 
return to competition shortly. 

While 
McFarland 
was 

hesitant to provide an exact 
timetable for Youtsey’s return, 
he said the Wolverines have to 
take a cautious approach.

“We’re 
excited 
to 
have 

(Youtsey) back in our lineup, and 
I think he can help us a lot, but 
at the same time we have to be 
smart about how we’re doing it.”

Whenever he is able to return, 

Youtsey will not only provide a 
capable body in the 125-pound 
class but also some much-
needed veteran experience for 
the rest of the season.

Wolverines roll Northwestern

Redshirt sophomore Malik 

Amine stepped onto the mat for 
his dual meet debut on Sunday, 
looking to set the tone for the 
day. His was the first match of 
the meet, and it took all of 48 
seconds to accomplish his goal.

Amine made a quick reversal 

and 
pinned 
Northwestern’s 

Shayne Oster, giving his team an 
early 6-0 lead.

“I don’t like sitting around,” 

Amine said. “I like being warmed 
up and just getting out there at 
the beginning.”

The Michigan wrestling team 

prevailed over Northwestern, 
38-10, as the Wolverines racked 
up two pins by Amine and 
redshirt senior Conor Youtsey, 
and four technical falls.

Michigan was coming off 

a 
two-game 
losing 
streak 

against No. 6 Nebraska and 
No. 12 Illinois, and though 
Northwestern is not currently 
ranked in the top 25 (NCAA), 
the Wolverines clearly flipped a 

switch on Sunday.

“The coaches sat us down 

after the dual on Friday and 
told us we need to go out there 
and attack 100 percent of the 
time,” said redshirt freshman 
Jackson Striggow. “We had a 
great turnaround in a span of 
two days.”

Following Amine’s dominant 

start to the dual, senior Brian 
Murphy followed suit, sitting in 
the driver’s seat for the whole 
match in his 21-4 technical fall 
victory 
over 
Northwestern’s 

Ben Sullivan in the 157-pound 
weight class. With a single-leg 
takedown around 50 seconds 
into 
the 
match, 
Murphy 

controlled the pace throughout, 
amassing 
riding 
time 
and 

curtailing most of Sullivan’s 
opportunities.

No. 
2 
redshirt 
freshman 

Logan 
Massa 
continued 
his 

impactful season with a 26-10 
technical fall win. His opponent, 
Johnny Sebastian, gained most 
of his points with escapes, as 
Massa’s overwhelming offense 
was simply too much.

Michigan’s advantage Sunday 

was its immense share of the 
riding time. Already ahead 
by a sizable margin, redshirt 
freshman Myles Amine utilized 
the momentum of the rest of his 
team as well as riding time to 
grab a 21-6 win.

Redshirt 
junior 
Aaron 

Calderon fell to Northwestern’s 
Mitch Sliga by a 13-2 major 
decision in the 165-pound match, 
joining heavyweight freshman 
Dan Perry, who was pinned 
around the six-minute mark in 
his contest, as the two losses for 
the Wolverines on the day.

In 
the 
197-pound 
match, 

Striggow prevailed, 6-3, in a highly 
contested match that was back-
and-forth for much of its duration. 
Striggow snagged two early points 
for escapes and was able to stave 
off the Wildcats’ rebuttal.

“(You) just have to have faith 

in what you do, and know that 
when you keep grinding on him, 
he will break down eventually,” 
Striggow said.

With a solid lead, Michigan 

delivered a dagger with three 
wins from Youtsey and redshirt 
freshmen Stevan Micic and Sal 
Profaci. Micic prevailed via 
technical fall, 17-2, and Profaci 
again utilized riding time to 
come out with a hard-fought 7-3 
decision.

Michigan’s 
hardened 

ideology was evident in the 
closer matches, where certain 
techniques were not yielding 
positive results. Both Striggow 
and Profaci won by less than 
five points, but with riding time 
and aggressiveness, the matches 
ended in the Wolverines’ favor.

Michigan will look to bring 

the early aggressiveness back 
home to finish a long stretch 
of Big Ten matchups against 
Rutgers on Friday.

“We have to continue to 

talk about it and work on 
it,” said Michigan coach Joe 
McFarland. “Young teams can 
be inconsistent and we saw that 
on Friday. We bounced back well 
today, though.”

Wolverines stomp Cornhuskers on the road

After dropping the first game of 

its road trip to No. 3 Maryland on 
Thursday, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team was determined 
to return home from Nebraska 
with a win Sunday.

The 
Wolverines 
(5-2 
Big 

Ten, 16-5 overall) thoroughly 
outplayed 
the 
struggling 

Cornhuskers (1-7, 5-16), executing 
on all facets of the game to earn 
an 84-51 victory. For the third 
time in four games, four Michigan 
players contributed double-digit 
points: freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick, sophomore guard 
Nicole Munger, sophomore center 
Hallie Thome, and junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty.

Gondrezick set the tempo 

early in the first period, assisting 
Thome for a layup at the 8:57 mark, 

then stealing the ball and taking it 
for a layup of her own less than 
thirty seconds later. By the end of 
the first quarter, Gondrezick had 
seven points — including another 
fast-break layup — and went on to 
record 13 points, four assists and 
two boards.

Flaherty once again led the 

team in scoring, finishing the 
game with 27 points on 11-for-16 
shooting, and Munger came off 
the bench to go 4-for-6 from the 
3-point line. Meanwhile, Thome 
notched 15 points, working hard 
down low to make it to the free-
throw line, where she went 7-for-9.

The collective scoring efforts 

from the quartet helped Michigan 
end the game with a noteworthy 
57.4 shooting percentage from 
the floor. Flaherty, Thome and 
Gondrezick are Michigan’s top 
three scorers this season, but 
Munger’s 18-point performance 
was a season-high — and only one 
point shy of a career-high.

“(Munger) was outstanding,” 

Barnes Arico said. “She just gave 
us a different look from the floor 
spot. She’s a guard for us, but 
when Hallie went and got in foul 
trouble and they stayed in that 
zone, we needed another scoring 
threat on the inside. Nicole 
provided that.”

Despite 

the 
33-point 

win, 
Nebraska 

appeared 
dangerous 
in 

the first quarter, 
shooting 
70 

percent 
from 

the floor. But 
Michigan’s 
defense 
stood 

tall to weather 
the storm, and 
the Cornhuskers’ shooting fell to 
just 40.8 percent by the game’s 
end. 
Nebraska 
has 
typically 

relied on sophomore forward 
Jessica Shepard — the 2016 Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year — but 
the Wolverines shut her down, 

limiting her to just four points.

Michigan’s primary defensive 

standouts were Thome and junior 
forward Jillian Dunston. Dunston 
had six rebounds and three 
assists against the Cornhuskers, 
outrebounded only by Thome, 
who had a team-high of eight 

defensive boards. 
But Dunston was 
the 
Wolverine 

who 
clearly 

overwhelmed the 
6-foot-4 Shepard. 

“(Shepard) 

was obviously a 
major 
concern 

for us after the 
performance she 
had 
last 
year,” 

Barnes Arico said. 

“I think (Dunston) has a year 
more experience underneath her 
belt, and I think our team does. 
We have a lot of pieces returning 
so we’re more of an experienced 
squad. We spent a lot of time 
talking about what we needed to 
do against her, and I thought we 
executed the game plan.”

Noticeably missing from the 

pack of double-digit scorers was 
senior guard and captain Siera 
Thompson, 
who 
scored 
just 

three points, but still contributed 
offensively with seven assists.

“I just think that (scoring) is 

probably number five on her list 
of things to do,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Her leadership has been 
incredible. ... She just does so 
much for us.”

While the Wolverines were 

expected to beat the basement-
dwelling Nebraska, it was still a 
confidence-building victory for 
Michigan.

“I think it was a test of our 

team’s focus (to lock in) on 
this game,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Especially 
after 
playing 
at 

Maryland, it’s easy to get up to 
play the number three team in 
the country. But to play them 
down to the wire, and then have 
to get ready for a team that’s at the 
bottom of the league right now, 
and at their place — teams can 
slip up on games like that. And I 
think tonight really showed our 
maturity.”

WATER POLO
Michigan faces early 
tests in first tourney

Sixteen Californians on the 

Michigan women’s water polo 
team traveled home to kick off the 
2017 season at the UCSB Winter 
Invitational in Santa Barbara, 
Calif., where the Wolverines went 
3-2 in the pool after facing five 
consecutive top-25 opponents.

Michigan began the weekend 

facing No. 2 Southern California 
in a top-10 battle. After freshmen 
utility player Maddy Steere scored 
two goals in the first period, the 
Wolverines only managed to find 
the back of the net once more, 
falling to the powerhouse 11-3, 
as the Trojans scored the game’s 
final eight goals.

But Michigan bounced back on 

the second day of the invitational, 
defeating No. 25 CSU Bakersfield 
by nearly the same margin that 
it had lost to USC, 11-2. Four 
Wolverines netted at least two 
goals in the rout, including 
sophomore attacker Julia Sellers 
who 
scored 
a 

hat-trick, helping 
Michigan 
put 

together 
an 

impressive 
second 
half 

in 
which 
it 

outscored 
CSU 

Bakersfield, 9-1.

In its second 

top-10 game of 
the weekend, the 
Wolverines took 
on No. 9 UCSB, the tournament’s 
host. The Gauchos led 3-2 at 
the break, but Michigan once 
again put together a successful 
second half to down UCSB, 7-4. 
Sophomore defensive player Kim 
Johnson scored twice to help 
the Wolverines overcome the 
halftime deficit. Senior center 
Allison Skaggs provided the final 
blow, beating the Gauchos’ goalie 
with a beautiful backhanded goal 
to give Michigan its seventh goal 
of the game.

In addition to some strong 

offensive 
performances, 
the 

Wolverines 
played 
lockdown 

defense, holding CSU Bakersfield, 
UCSB, and Cal State Northridge 
to a combined 11 goals.

“I thought defensively we 

did a really, really good job,” 
said Michigan coach Marcelo 
Leonardi.

Two highly recruited freshmen 

who were making their collegiate 
debuts fueled Michigan’s success 
this past weekend. Offensively, 
Steere totaled nine goals including 
her first career hat trick, while 
goalie Heidi Ritner recorded over 
40 saves.

“I thought they both did a 

fantastic job,” Leonardi said. 
“Heidi was able to keep us in 
games early. … and Maddy gave us 
not only a punch at the two-meter 
defender position, but she was 
also able to score.”

In their third top-10 matchup 

of the tournament, the Wolverines 
battled No. 3 UCLA. Sellers 
recorded her second hat trick of 
the year, but it was not enough to 
fuel Michigan to victory, as it fell 
to the Bruins, 12-5.

To close out 

the 
weekend, 

the 
Wolverines 

faced off against 
No. 23 Cal State 
Northridge. 
The Wolverines 
began 
play 

aggressively and 
took an early 4-0 
lead. From there, 
they never let up, 
finishing off the 

Matadores, 18-5. Michigan was 
dominant, with Sellers, Steere, 
junior Caroline Anderson and 
Johnson all notching at least three 
goals.

After competing against a slew 

of ranked opponents so early 
in the season, it is no question 
that, along with an opportunity 
for some of the players to return 
home, Michigan gained valuable 
experience in Santa Barbara.

“I think that the level of play 

that we faced only makes us 
tougher,” Leonardi said. “If you 
want to be the best, you’ve got to 
play the best.”

‘M’ salvages series 
with shootout win

EAST LANSING — Cooper 

Marody took the puck on his 
stick at center ice. Michigan 
State’s Sam Saliba had just 
missed 
his 
attempt, 
and 
with the 
shootout tied at two, Marody 
skated 
toward 
net 
with 
a 

chance to claim victory for his 
Wolverines. 
The 
sophomore 

forward rose to the occasion, 
lighting the lamp and welcoming 
his teammates who streamed 
from the bench in celebration. 

After a scoreless overtime 

period, the Michigan hockey 
team found itself in a shootout 
with in-state rival Michigan 
State. With Marody’s goal, the 
Wolverines claimed victory and 
salvaged an ugly weekend to split 
the home-and-home series at 
Munn Ice Arena 
in East Lansing 
on 
Saturday. 

Though 
the 

result 
will 

offically 
be 

listed as a tie 
on 
Michigan’s 

schedule, 
it 

still 
gave 
the 

Wolverines 
(2-6 
Big 
Ten, 

9-12-1 overall) a 
valuable point in Big Ten play.

“I thought we played harder, 

played with more conviction,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “Overall, we ended 
up with a better result. I thought 
from start to finish, maybe 
the first couple of minutes we 
weren’t as good, and then we 
got better. They’re a good team 
too, but it was important to come 
in here and play for points. The 
team that loses this game sinks 
to last place in the Big Ten.”

The first period was mostly 

spent in Michigan’s defensive 
zone, where senior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort faced nine 
total shots. Michigan State’s 
goaltender, 
Ed 

Minney, 
faced 

significantly less 
of a challenge 
with just four. 
But 
one 
of 

those four shots 
proved fatal for 
the 
Spartans 

(1-7, 5-16-1), as it 
turned out to be 
the first goal of 
the game.

After 
Michigan 
State 

forward Villiam Haag received 
a penalty for tripping, the 
Wolverines couldn’t capitalize 
on the power-play opportunity. 
Four 
seconds 
after 
Haag 

returned to the ice, though, De 
Jong scored off a snipe from the 
point to put Michigan ahead, 
1-0, just over six minutes into 
the first period.

“That was huge. We were 

playing well, good shot, good 
goal, and I thought we got a lot of 
momentum from that,” Berenson 
said. “Let’s face it, we just played 
three periods at home without 
scoring, so we needed a goal.”

But 
just 
a 
few 
minutes 

later, Michigan State forward 
Dylan Pavelek scored the first 
goal of his career to tie things 
up. Spartan forward Logan 
Lambdin managed a shot that 
Nagelvoort knocked away, but 
Pavelek was there to clean it up 
and tie the game with 9:34 left in 
the first period.

The game remained locked 

in a stalemate until 7:27 was 
left in the second period. Junior 
defenseman Sam Piazza sent 
the puck to senior forward Evan 
Allen down by the net, but Allen 
sent it back without a clear shot 
available. 
Piazza 
then 
fired 

a shot from the point, which 
senior forward Alex Kile was 
able to knock past Minney for 
the third goal of the night.

Michigan 

State 
desperately tried 
to close the gap, 
and was almost 
able to early on. 
Forward 
Joe 

Cox 
brought 

the 
puck 
to 

Michigan’s 
net 

and 
wrapped 

around 
it, 

sending the puck 

to forward Thomas Ebbing. But 
Ebbing couldn’t convert from in 
close, and the Spartans left the 
second period down only one 
goal.

Michigan 
State’s 
student 

section 
couldn’t 
have 
been 

hungrier for the equalizer. Down 
2-1 in the third period, every 
missed attempt had the Spartans’ 
fan base avidly expressing their 
frustration.

Yet with roughly 10 minutes 

remaining, 
they 
had 
their 

frustrations put to rest, as the 
students were throwing confetti 
and filling Munn Ice Arena with 
cheers after forward Patrick 
Khoderenko tipped a shot into 

Michigan’s net 
on a power play 
to tie the game 
at two.

But with no 

decisive 
goal 

scored 
in 
the 

overtime period, 
the 
game’s 

ultimate 
result 

came 
from 

the 
shootout. 

Marody was able 

to capitalize on his opportunity, 
and the Wolverines won the 
second game, 3-2.

“It was good to see the puck 

go in the net and get that extra 
point for us for sure,” Marody 
said. “We battled hard all game 
and then I took a penalty at the 
end, so it was good that the boys 
battled back and we were able to 
have the opportunity to win in 
the shootout.”

Wilson provides spark for Wolverines

Leading up to the Michigan 

men’s basketball team’s rematch 
against 
Illinois, 
John 
Beilein 

indicated that the Wolverines 
needed a spark.

He 
acknowledged 
Friday 

that when Michigan has made 
noise in the past, it had found 
one player who could rise to the 
occasion around this point of the 
season. Beilein also admitted 
that, though he’s seen flashes 
from players capable of adopting 
that role, he still didn’t know who 
the Wolverines’ outlier would 
ultimately be.

But when Michigan took the 

floor 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
DJ 

Wilson gave him more than just a 
flash.

The redshirt sophomore put 

his stamp on the game all day, 
but the exclamation point came 
long before the final buzzer 
sounded.

With just over 12 minutes to play 

in the first half and the Wolverines 
up by four, senior wing Zak Irvin 
couldn’t connect on a jumper. 
The ball clanked off the iron, but 
Wilson seemed to teleport to the 
rim, grabbing the offensive board 
and 
simultaneously 
throwing 

down an electrifying putback 
slam, all while drawing a foul to 
give him an and-one opportunity.

The 
dunk 
injected 
energy 

into Crisler Center, waking up 
a dormant crowd that — to that 
point — had been quieter than the 
100 members of Illinois’s student 
section that had traveled to Ann 
Arbor and claimed seats in the 
nosebleeds.

The putback proved to be 

the first of two, and just two of 
Wilson’s 12 first-half points. His 
point total, along with his four 
rebounds, four assists and one 
block, was the perfect remedy for 
a team that has struggled to start 
games well — especially when 
Michigan was blown out by 16 in 
Champaign 10 days ago.

Wilson went on to finish with 

a game-high 19 points on 7-for-10 

shooting, seven rebounds and five 
assists, leading the Wolverines to 
a 66-57 win against the Fighting 
Illini in which the final score didn’t 
properly account for Michigan’s 
domination.

“… When I just think about 

(Michigan) right now, it’s points 
off turnovers (and) second-chance 
points, which DJ Wilson was a big 
part of,” said Illinois coach John 
Groce. “I just thought he made the 
right play. He got you on the glass, 
he took open shots, he made his 
team better.

“I thought he really competed, 

got good length and size. … I just 
thought he was really active and 
engaged in all facets of the game, 
certainly not to (diminish) some 
other guys that played well for 
them throughout the two games, 
but I think he’s kind of the guy that 
stood out for me.”

In reality, save for the five assists 

— Wilson was averaging just 1.21 
per game — the performance 
is nothing new for him. He has 
emerged as a new force in the 
frontcourt for the Wolverines this 
season after a nearly nonexistent 
role in his first two years.

But for a Michigan team that 

struggles on the glass and on 
defense, especially in the low post, 
Beilein’s outlier may have been in 
his starting lineup throughout the 
last 18 games.

After all, Wilson helped hold 

Wisconsin forwards Ethan Happ 
and Nigel Hayes below double 
digits until his foul-ridden second 
half.

Against Illinois, it was more 

of the same. The Fighting Illini 
torched Michigan’s frontcourt in 
their matchup on Jan. 11, as center 
Maverick Morgan and forward 
Leron Black combined for 26 
points. Yet on Saturday, Wilson led 
the effort that held the pair to just 
10 points.

Establishing a consistency in 

Wilson’s game, then, could send 
that spark Beilein has been looking 
for resonating throughout the 
Wolverines.

Against No. 17 Wisconsin, for 

example, despite his defensive 

presence, Wilson fouled out with 
zero points and five rebounds in 30 
minutes played. And early in the 
year when Michigan was blown 
out against South Carolina, he had 
just two points and four rebounds.

Still, 
Wilson’s 
performance 

against 
Illinois 
on 
Saturday 

serves as the latest example of his 
uncanny ability to bounce back in 
a convincing fashion, and those 
performances often come off 
residual touches that come with 
the flow of the game.

Beilein has admitted that the 

future could hold more plays that 
aim to get the ball in Wilson’s 
hands, and if that’s the missing 
piece to the puzzle, the Wolverines 
could reap the benefits. But for 
now, Wilson’s showing against 
Illinois might be enough to start 
something special.

“Each game we need it,” Beilein 

said. “But gradually we’ll get to 
this point, hopefully before too 
long, that guys really feel confident 
and they know they’ve got their 
‘swag’ enough to play at their 
highest level every day.”

Perhaps 
Wilson’s 
most 

profound impact, though, couldn’t 
be found in his own stat line, but 
in that of senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. After the game, Walton 
admitted that both his and Irvin’s 
confidence is fueled by the way 
others are playing around them.

On Saturday, Walton was able to 

reel in 10 rebounds to go with his 13 
points and notch a double-double. 
Following the victory, Walton 
credited his rebounding total to the 
way Michigan’s big men boxed out 
down low. As the starting forward 
alongside 
sophomore 
Moritz 

Wagner, Wilson is certainly a large 
contributor to that.

“He’s such a great player,” 

Walton said. “He had such a good 
summer and has worked so hard 
over his two years in just changing 
his body. Like I said, everybody 
saw the potential. It was all about 
him getting his body right and 
being able to play.

“Nights where he’s scoring and 

rebounding as well as he does, I 
think he could make a living out of 
this game.”

Michigan coach John Beilein found the spark he was looking for in DJ Wilson.

Now or never

T

he days when the 
Michigan hockey team 
was a flashy, offensive 

juggernaut are long gone.

The Wolverines are currently 

the worst Corsi team in the 
nation, 
meaning 
they give 
up far 
more shots 
than they 
attempt 
themselves.

As a 

result, 
Michigan 
coach Red 
Berenson has turned his team’s 
focus to defense, effort and 
consistency. Unfortunately for 
Michigan, for much of this year, 
it hasn’t been good enough.

Take the Great Lakes 

Invitational, where, after giving 
up a 4-1 lead, the Wolverines 
needed overtime against 
Michigan State to notch a 
lackluster third-place finish 
after their coaches and players 
had pinpointed it as a turning 
point for the season. So as the 
rematch against the Spartans 
approached, you’d think that 
would motivate Michigan. 
Instead, the Wolverines let 
Michigan State come into Yost 
Ice Arena and dominate its way 

to a 3-0 win. 

“We talked all week about 

trying to change our Friday 
effort and result, and obviously 
we didn’t,” Berenson said. “It’s 
not like these are great plays. 
They’re just hardworking 
plays, and we’re not playing 
well enough without the puck, 
and we’re not finishing our 
chances.”

There are specific aspects of 

its game that Michigan needs to 
improve. But as the season goes 
on and results like Friday’s keep 
piling up, the team’s effort and 
consistency continue to come 
into question.

And while that may seem 

like a cop out answer for the 
Wolverines, it makes sense. No 
coach is going to ask their team 
to change its identity from game 
to game.

Even after Saturday’s win 

over the Spartans, Berenson 
acknowledged that the 
difference wasn’t strategy, it 
was just better execution.

“We had to be better in our 

zone, and I think we were,” 
Berenson said. “I thought we 
got out of the zone, we got the 
puck in deep better.

“We were a better team 

tonight than we were last night. 
It wasn’t strategy, it was just 
concentrating on playing the 

right way.”

For Michigan, playing the 

right way currently means 
playing solid defense while 
mainly relying on dumping 
and chasing on offense and 
winning one-on-one battles to 
the puck. This is what teams 
need to do when they aren’t 
talented enough to skate around 
defenses or big enough to skate 
through them. Right now the 
Wolverines are one of those 
teams.

Michigan has aimed to 

outwork teams, but has yet to 
do so consistently. If it had, 
its season might look a lot 
different. 

It’s a dangerous way to play 

hockey, and the Wolverines’ 
various results are indicative 
of that. They beat No. 2 Boston 
University and No. 9 Union 
early in the year when the 
team’s energy was high, and 
Michigan looked like a team 
that could grind out wins 
against some of the best in 
the country. At other times, 
when the Wolverines’ effort is 
lacking and they aren’t playing 
as smart, they can lose 3-0 to a 
team like Michigan State, the 
No. 48 team in the Pairwise 
Rankings who they have 
dominated in the past, winning 
10 of their last 15 meetings.

The difference between the 

two types of performances 
was never more evident than 
in Michigan’s series against 
the Terriers. In the first game, 
with four seniors out of the 
lineup due to a suspension, the 
remaining Wolverines played 
their best game of the season. 
Players like junior forwards 
Dexter Dancs and Tony 
Calderone showed up in the box 
score and helped lead the team 
to a 4-0 win. 

The very next night, when 

the seniors returned to the 
lineup, Michigan stumbled and 
fell, 4-2. And while that series 
may have been the most glaring 
example of the Wolverines’ 
inconsistency, it certainly 
isn’t the only one. Michigan 
hasn’t swept a weekend series 
all season, and this past 
weekend was arguably its best 
opportunity to do so. 

“We’re trying everything 

as much as we can,” said 
senior defenseman Nolan 
De Jong after Friday’s loss. 
“We’ve been mixing things up, 
whether it’s in practice or in 
our preparation or things like 
that. I think, honestly, we’re a 
pretty frustrated group right 
now, because I feel like we’re 
putting the work in, and we’re 
working hard. But we’re just not 
executing, and we’re not seeing 
the results.”

And that has been the story 

of the Wolverines’ season. 
Even when they work hard one 
game and play well, it seems 
that nobody — even themselves 
— knows if they’ll be able to 
replicate that performance in 
the next game.

But that trend can’t continue. 

The Wolverines will have to 
find the consistency that has 
eluded them so far, because 
they’re running out of time 
quickly. And if the past few 
weeks are any indication, 
if Michigan doesn’t change 
something, things aren’t getting 
better any time soon.
