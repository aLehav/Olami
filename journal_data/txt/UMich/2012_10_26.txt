James Holmes
applied to
neuroscience
graduate program
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Though other universities,
have approved requests for the
release of the graduate school
application of James Holmes -
the 24 year old charged in the
mass shootingthat took place at
an Aurora, Colo. movie theater
in July - the University denied
a Freedom of Information Act
request to view his denied appli-
cation to the University's neuro-
science graduate program.
In a letter to The Michigan
Daily on Tuesday, Gary Krenz,
special counsel ' to University
President Mary Sue Coleman,
denied the Daily's appeal to the
University's initial denial for the
documents early this month.
In a Sept. 11 letter to The
Michigan Daily, Patricia Sell-
inger, the University's FOIA
coordinator, said an Aug. 31
request to review Holmes's
application was denied because
disclosing the application would
"constitute an unwarranted
invasion of an individual's pri-

vacy," which is an excerpt from
Section 13 (1)(a) of the Michigan
Freedom of Information Act,
and details exemptions from the
act.
The state's FOIA law details
how public records should be
released and what types of
records and information do
not have to be released, ofare
exempt from the law.
In his response to the Daily's
appeal, Krenz wrote that the
University generally deems
applications as exempt from
FOIA.
"It is our considered assess-
ment that a student application
is an integral record and that
disclosure of any part ofit would
constitute anunwarranted inva-
sion of privacy," Krenz wrote.
Though Michigan's FOIA law
allows for private information
within a document to be redact-
ed, Krenz wrote that the release
of any part of an application
would put the entire admissions
process in jeopardy.
"The release of a student
application inthis or other cases
would havewebelieve, deleteri-
ous effect on the applicants and
on the admissions process, and
we consequently believe that
the University and the public
are best served by protecting the
integrity and confidentiality of

Coalition for
Tuition Equality
continues efforts
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
DailyStaffReporter
Though most students dread
the thought of voluntarily wak-
ing up before 8 a.m., the Coali-
tion for Tuition Equality did just

that Thursday morning to advo-
cate for undocumented student
tuition equity.
More than 100 students rep-
resenting all 17 member groups
of CTE - including the Uni-
versity's chapter of College
Democrats and the Migrant and
Immigrant's Rights Advocacy
group - attended the protest
outside the Fleming Administra-
tion Building. Fighting Obstacles
Knowing Ultimate Success, a

student organization that uses
the arts to promote social equal-
ity, planned the early morning
event in an attempt to attract
administrator attention to their
cause. Attendees plastered The
Cube in Regent's. Plaza with
stickers while carrying posters
and banners boasting the pro-
test's message - "the dream of
affordable tuition for undocu-
mented students is too large to
be silenced."

The theme of the event was
"My dream is bigger than..." and
attendees scrawled messages
such as "My documents," "Mich-
igan Football," and "Mary Sue"
on stickers, posters and chalk-
boards.
After a few brief speeches and
rally cries, the student activists
linked arms, creating a human
chain around the administration
building.

GOING

TO "THE
AlIRPORT?

CSG
From Page 1
ment Compiled Code article on
elections is -poorly constructed,
containing a number of incoher-
ent, ambiguous, contradictory
and absurd provisions," he wrote
in the decision.
Since then, the election code
has been struck from the CSG
Compiled Code in its entirety,
and after a month of revisions, a
resolution for a new election code
co-authored by nine people was
proposed at Tuesday night's CSG
assembly meeting.
Jeremy Keeney, a Law stu-
dent and CSG rules committee
chair, and Michael Proppe, a
Business junior and assembly
speaker, said at the meeting that
they hope the proposed election
code will prevent the recurrence
of similar hearings and intro-
duce other beneficial rules for
the next major CSG election in
March 2013.-
The sweeping, 15-page reso-
lution addresses several issues
that stemmed from the March
elections and, unlike the former
code, defines abuse of e-mail
listservs, coordination between
candidates and their support-
ers and introduces campaign
finance language.
In response to confusion
during the March hearing con-
cerning the definition of owner-
ship of University listservs, the
proposed election code states
that only the owner listed by
the MCommunity website may
be allowed to send campaign
e-mails to a listserv.
While the proposed and
former election codes punish
abuse of listservs with demer-
its for every person the e-mail
is sent to, the UEC cited "miti-
gating factors" in its decision to
lower the number of demerits it
awarded to Parikh and Hashwi
from more than 1,000 to four.
Five demerits are needed to
disqualify a candidate from the
election.
The use of mitigating factors
was appealed and the case was
brought to the CSJ, which could
only make a decision based on
the mitigating factors outlined
by the UEC at that time. While
CSJ later found that only two of
the 11 mitigating factors were

valid, the decision was upheld'
based on those factors when the
hearing was remanded to the
UEC.
However, under the proposed
election code, "questions of law
are reviewed using a de novo
standard" by the CSJ, meaning
it is required to look at each case
as if it is being heard for the first
time.
"Before, the standard was the
UEC had to be clearly wrong,
in order for the Central Stu-
dent Judiciary to overrule them
when they mitigated damages,"
Keeney said. "Now they just
have to be wrong in the CSJ's
opinion - in order to be wrong
is a lower threshold than to be
clearly wrong."
Furthermore, the election
code would require that an
infraction committed by a non-
candidate fulfill three compo-
nents in order for demerits to
be awarded to a candidate. The
three components would better
define coordination and implied
coordination between a candi-
date and his or her supporters,
an issue that was hotly contest-
ed during the March hearing.
Aside from changes that are
solely reactionary to that hear-
ing, the addition of campaign
finance laws to the election code
would have required additional
paperwork by each campaign.
According to the proposed
regulation, presidential cam-
paigns cannot spend more than
$1,000 toward their campaign
and parties can only spend an
additional $50 for each leg-
islative candidate running
with their party. This would
have limited, for instance, the
amount of spendable funds for
Parikh and Hashwi's campaign
last spring to $1,000, but would
have allowed MForward to
spend $2,700 because it had a
presidential ticket and 34 legis-
lative candidates.
Moreover, only students
would be able to donate to cam-
paigns, and those donations
would be limited to $25 for each
legislative campaign and $100
for presidential tickets. Under
these rules, a single student
could have donated a total of
$950 to MForward's campaign
last year.
All spending and donations
would have to be reported to

the UEC before the polls open
through forms described in
the proposed resolution. Those
forms would then be made pub-
lic online within 24 hours after
they are submitted to the UEC.
Furthermore, any campaign
funds not spentby the end of the
election -must be "reported to
the UEC, must be donated to the
(Student Organization Fund-
ing Commission), a University
of Michigan sponsored scholar-
ship fund, or a 501(c)(3) char-
ity of the candidate's choice"
within one week of the election
results.
The resolution, however,
does not define the difference
between the general funds a
party owns and funds specifi-
cally allocated to campaigning.
"I guess under the current
language, my understanding of
this would be campaign funds is
money spent duringthe election
period on the election," Proppe
said. "I think that's a really good
point that we need to clarify
though."
Similarly, the resolution has
no language to prevent laun-
dering of campaign donations
through other students by non-"
students, or those who have
maxed out their donations.
"There's actually no way to
track that," Keeney said.
Lastly, the resolution lacks
language that indicates if money
donated to a party for a legisla-
tive candidate must be spent
specifically on that candidate or
if that moneycanbe spent onthe
presidential campaign or other
legislative candidates.
Violation of rules regard-
ing campaign finance would be
regarded as a major infraction
under the proposed resolution
and would be punishable by two
to four demerits.
While the addition of finan-
cial regulations adds a multitude
of ways students can violate the
election code, Proppe said the
benefit of the legislation out-
weighs potential hearings that
could stem from it.
"I don't think it's good to
eliminate good rules because
we're afraid they'll be broken,"
Proppe said.
Keeney added that the new
code also levels the playing field
of campaigns.
"The overall purpose of this

is to increase transparency as to
how much people are spending
and to make it fair so that some-
one who comes from a rich fam-
ily doesn't automatically have an
advantage," he said. "I feel like
this is a good, at least, first step
toward that."
Endorsements made by CSG
members, another issue dur-
ing the March election, are also
addressed by the resolution.
"Neither the Assembly nor
any of its committees, commis-
sions, select committees, UEC,
University Elections Judiciary,
nor Election Director shall
endorse any candidate in any
election," the proposed election
code reads.
This stipulation would have
come into effect last year when
Michael Budros, then a vice-
chair of SOFC, wrote a view-
point in The Michigan Daily
endorsing Business junior
Shreya Singh for president and
signed the viewpoint with his
full title. The amount of demer-
its that could be issued for this
infraction is unclear because it's
not listed in the minor, major or
egregious infractions sections
of the proposed election code.
The idea of preventing mem-
bers of CSG from publicly
endorsing candidates was origi-
nally discussed in April follow-
ing the election, but a resolution
with language similar to that of
the proposed election code was
voted down.
The proposed election code
however, added that "as indi-
viduals, members of CSG may
endorse the candidacy of any
candidate in any election."
Finally, a rule that restrict-
ed a party from capitalizing
more than the first letter of its
name was absent from the pro-
posed resolution. youMICH,
MForward and OurMichigan
could all have been pressed for
one demerit under this rule,
although no party filed a com-
plaint.
The resolution will be dis-
cussed and further tabled at
Sunday's rules committee meet-
ing. It will require a majority of
support from the assembly, as it
changes only the compiled code
of CSG - not its constitution
or operating procedures, both
of which require a two-thirds
majority.

Don't mess with Texas elec-

Abbott, a Republican with a

Israel mum after
blast rocks Sudan
munitions factory
Senior Israeli officials accused
Sudan on Thursday of playing a
key role in an Iranian-backed net-
work of arms shipments to hostile
Arab militant groups across the
Middle East, a day after a myste-
rious explosion rocked a weapons
factory near the North African
country's capital.
The tough words were likely to
add to Sudanese suspicions that
an Israeli airstrike was behind the
blast. Israel has both the motive
and means to carry out such an
airstrike, and Sudan has accused
Israel in the past of operating on
its territory.
Israel considers Iran to be a
grave threat, citing Iranian calls
for Israel's destruction, suspi-

cions that Iran is developing a
nuclear bomb, and Iran's support
for militant groups on Israel's
southern and northern borders.
Israeli officials have long con-
tended that Sudan is a central
player in Iranian efforts to fun-
nel weapons to Hamas militants
in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah
guerrillas in Lebanon.

It may also threaten Defense

At showcase, TechArb
highlights student work

20 student venture
teams share
projects at event
By ALICIA ADAMCZY X
Daily StaffReporter
Much like Diagon Alley, the
Liberty Square parking struc-
ture located at 510 E. Wash-
ington St. doesn't seem out
of the ordinary. But one floor
below the structure's surface,
student entrepreneurs are
collaborating to create the
extraordinary.
The University's Center for
Entrepreneurship, located in'
the basement of the parking
structure, held its Student Ven-
ture Showcase on Thursday. At
the event - hosted by CFE's
TechArb Student Startup
Accelerator, and co-sponsored
by the Samuel Zell & Robert H.
Lurie Institute for Entrepre-
neurial Studies, the College of
Engineering and the Office of
the Vice President for Research
- iore than 100 students and
faculty attended in hopes of
attracting investors for their
fledgling businesses.
The 20 student venture
teams in attendance were com-
prised of undergraduate and
graduate students from vary-
ing educational backgrounds.
University alum Richard
Sheridan - president and
CEO of Menlo Innovations, a

software design and develop-
ment firm located on E. Lib-
erty Street - gave the opening
remarks at the event, citing
Ann Arbor as the nextPalo Alto
in termsof startup potential.
"This is how we are going to
reinvent Michigan," Sheridan
said of the student entrepre-
neurs.
University alum Mahendra
Vora - the founder and manag-
ing director of Vora Ventures,
which helps to found and sell
technological ventures - said
he attended the event to sup-
port other student entrepre-
neurs.
"That's all I've done my
whole life, is startups," Vora
said. "I'm just excited to be
batk at my alma mater. Twen-
ty-five years later there's noth-
ing like this."
The student startups includ-
ed several Facebook and mobile
phone apps, a trivia game and
a hybrid solar energy system,
among others..
A select few of the student
presenters also had the oppor-
tunity to meet privately with
investors Thursday afternoon.
Rackham student Jus-
tin D'Atri represented Torch
Hybrid, LLC, a company that
produces power management
computer systems for hybrid
boats. He said the mentorship,
advisory roles and the indus-
try connections provided by
CFE were indispensible in his
team's startup quest.

"We wouldn't even be here
right now if it weren't for the
CFE," D'Atri said. "We just had
a silly idea a year ago and it's
turned all the way into some-
thing we can actually make
money with."
University alum Sam Beck-
ett is a member of Exo Dynam-
ics, LLC, a startup seeking to
improve the treatment pro-
cess for people afflicted with
chronic spinal conditions. He
said TechArb has been a help-
ful tool for his team in the past
six months.

PROTEST

"What do we want? Justice,"
they chanted as a few Univer-
sity employees watched from
inside the building. "When do
we want it? Now!"
LSA junior John D'Adamo,
a College Democrats member,
led chants and gave multiple
speeches throughout the event.
D'Adamo criticized University
President Mary Sue Coleman for
her lack of public response to the
coalition's goals, saying it was
inconsistent with the Univer-
sity'svalues.
"The (University) president
probably uses 'diversity' more
than any other word in the
English language," D'Adamo
remarked to a laughing crowd.
LSA sophomore Sam Hahn
stood at the front of the admin-
istration building, passing out
free coffee and fliers to admin-
istrators arriving to work. One
woman declined to accept the
flyer.
"No thanks," she said as she
headed inside. "I'd better not."
LSA senior Tatiana Hofmans,
a FOKUS member, said as a
Jamaican immigrant, she wants
to take the initiative to help other
immigrant students.

est project, a 10-part Showtime
documentary, "The Untold His-
tory of the United States," aims
to tell the story of the evolution
of the American National Secu-
rity State.
Clips from the documentary
were shown, and while it was
a lesson in history, Stone's nar-
ration never seemed like the
monotonic drawl of a tired his-
tory teacher.
Stone talked of how, while he
is considered a political film-
maker, he primarily looks to
understand and develop charac-
ters - he merely prefers those in
political power because "history
is determined by the top," and
he, as an artist, looks toward his-
tory for understanding, or lack
thereof.
Discussing his film "Nixon,"
'Stone said that, in his movies, he
attempts to get into the shoes of
the characters of history. Stone
may not have agreed with the
decisions of the Nixon admin-
istration, saying that Nixon
wasn't a "good" person (though
he noted a respect for Nixon's
self-loathing), but nevertheless
wanted to humanize the former
president.
"I emphasized with him, but
I didn't sympathize with him,"
Stone said of Nixon.
Throughout the talk, Stone
expressed how he wanted to

mass a-mails to the University's
Board of Regents.
"It's a creative and fun way
for people to get involved as
well as see the information
about what the cause is all
about and why to come out,"
Hofmans said.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in a statement
that Thursday's protesters were
respectful and "thoughtful" in
their approach to addressing
the issue.
"This is a difficult, compli-
cated and important topic,"
Fitzgerald wrote. "The Univer-
sity will continue its ongoing
collaboration with the coalition
and others to develop a prac-
tical response that is legally
compliant and reflects the Uni-
versity's core values of fairness
to all students and commitment
to maintaining a diverse and
inclusive community."
Sanjay Jolly, a Public Policy
graduate student and a repre-
sentative from the University's
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the protest
was intended to demonstrate to
University officials that the fight
for tuition equality is enduring.
"All of these events are dif-
ferent ways of engaging admin-
istrators," Jolly said. "There
is enormous support for this
change and there is enormous
opposition to this discrimina-
tion against our peers."
of filmmakers with a sense of
questioning, emphasizing how
important it is to not believe
everything they learn in high
school.
Stone just laughed when he
spoke about backlash from his
attempt, as a liberal director, to
disclose an alternative history of
the United States.
"Of course I'm goingto be rid-
iculed," Stone said.
He added though, that if
you make the film entertaining
enough, both conservatives and
liberals will want to watch it.
Some audience members
found the lack of film discussion
troubling, others, like Univer-
sity of Toledo film student Sylvia
Keller said they were intrigued
by the more political nature of
the conversation.
"I thought it was a very inter-
esting topic, mostly about how
ideas in popular culture can be
divided into binaries, and how
Oliver Stone's work sort of takes
those binaries that we segregate
ourselves into and turns it into
a dichotomy, and has us look at
it from a different perspective,"
Keller said.
During a questions and
answer period with audience
members, Stone listened eager-
ly to stories about experiences
in Vietnam, Yugoslavia and
Afghanistan. It's in moments
like this where one sees past the
politics and controversies, and
recognizes the man for someone
deeply interested in the world
around him, the present and the
past.


APPLICATION

that process," Krenz said. "We
therefore respectfully decline to
release any part of the record."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University's
response to the FOIA request
is consistent with how it has
responded to previous requests
for student applications:
"It's our view that is the pri-
vate business of that individual,"
Fitzgerald said.
When asked if exempting stu-
dent applications from release is
an official procedure followed
by the University's FOIA office,
Fitzgerald said it is simply the
University's general interpreta-
tion of the law.
"It's not a policy, it's how that
type of record - we see a stu-
dent application record as not
something that we're required
to release under FOIA," Fitzger-
ald said.
Fitzgerald added that upon
review of the application, the
University believes that it is
exempt from FOIA in its entire-
ty.
"We've looked at this docu-
ment, and we believe that this
document in total ... is exempt,"
Fitzgerald said.
The University's denial
comes after officials at the
University of Iowa, the Uni-
versity of Illinois and the Uni-
versity of Alabama released
Holmes's graduate applications
after receiving requests, which
Fitzgerald acknowledged.
"I can also appreciate with
other schools in other states
operating under... somewhat dif-
ferent FOIA laws may have come
to other decision on releasing
that material," Fitzgerald said.
However, all three universi-
ties exist in states that have sim-
ilar or less restrictive FOIA laws
than Michigan.
The Illinois FOIA law
exempts from disclosure, "per-

sonal information contained
within public records, the dis-
closure of which would con-
stitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy."
Illinois defines "unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy" as
the "disclosure of information
that is highly personal or objec-
tionable to a reasonable person
and in which the subject's right
to privacy outweighs any legiti-
mate public interest in obtaining
the information," according to
the state's FOIA policy.
The Iowa Open Records
Law states that, unless autho-
rized, "personal information
in records regarding a student,
prospective student, or former
student maintained, created,
collected or assembled by or for
a school corporation or educa-
tional institution maintaining
such records," should be kept
confidential.
Finally, the state of Ala-
bama's Open Records law does
not explicitly exempt personal
information.on the basis of pri-
vacy, but does exempt, "records
the disclosure of which would
otherwise be detrimental to the
best interests of the public."
Frank LoMonte, executive
director of the Student Press
Law Center - a Virginia-based
nonprofitthatprotectsthe rights
of journalists - said legal priva-
cy is largely based on whether a
person has a reasonable expec-
tation of privacy.
In the case of Holmes, whose
photo and biography have been
widely disseminated throughout
the media, LoMonte said there
is no reasonable expectation of
privacy.
"Once a person is caught up in
a nationwide headline-making
crime, that person loses any rea-
sonable expectation of privacy
in information they filed with
the government," LoMonte said.
He added that it's particularly
concerning that the Univer-
sity chose to deny access to the
entire document, rather than

simply redact clearly private
information.
"Typically, public records
are not an all or nothing mat-
ter," LoMonte said. "If you
can remove the portions of the
record that give away truly
secret information, like a social
security number, then you're
supposed to remove only those
portions and disclose the rest."
LoMonte said public informa-
tion like Holmes's date of birth,
hometown and high school are
not exempt under Michigan
FOIA.
"I find it hard to believe that
there's not anypartofthatrecord
that couldn't be safely revealed
without giving away top-secret
information," LoMonte said,
adding that information such as
the date of application could be
useful in knowing if he applied
to the University after being
denied by other institutions.
LoMonte added that ques-
tionable denial of FOIA requests
appears to be a trend, noting
that many government entities
believe requestors won't chal-
lenge them in court.
"I think we're definitely
seeing more and more that
government agencies are get-
ting bolder about withholding
records because they're con-
vinced they can get away with
it," LoMonte said. "They know
that it's costly and time consum-
ing to sue, and that a lot of media
outlets - especially campus
ones - don't have the time and
money to pursue it."
LoMonte said the University
has little reason to protect the
privacy of Holmes when the
public already knows many inti-
mate details of his life, and his
reputation is already damaged
beyond repair.
"I just can't see where there's
any interest in a public institu-
tion bending over backwards for
somebody who's never going to
see life outside a jail cell again
and whose life is an open book,"
LoMonte said.

Local post-secondary education deserves funding
M ichigan voters will encounter a series of bond propos-
als aiming to improve the state's community colleges on
the Nov. 6 ballot. Among the grandest is the $56-mil-
lion initiative of Macomb County Community College to enhance
its science and technology offerings, upgrade its arts program and
refurbish and expand campus buildings. The bond will be paid for
through a millage, a property tax equal.to about 20 cents for every
$1,000 of a property's taxable value. For such a small price, the needs
of communities may be fulfilled with better education opportuni-
ties and higher employment rates as a result. We should support the
proposed ballot measures to levy millages for community colleges.

Planes, brains and automobiles

ur brains evolved to survive,
not to thrive. At least they
didn't evolve to thrive in col-
legeandifyouget
stuck in a dinner
party discussion H
with an anthro-
pologist you'll M
likely hear why.
For 99 percent of
our hominid past,
we've been living
in the savannah MICHAEL
and not writing SMALLEGAN
anything down.
These days, mid-
semester we have to produce polished
prose pieces about once a week, and
our evolutionary past is disrupting
our workflow.
For the sake of argument, try
to push aside your first thought
upon hearing this anthropologi-
cal factoid, which I know is some-
thing along the lines of: "Wow,
so if I went to college in 4,000
BCE, before written language was
invented, I wouldn't have had to
write any papers!" (At least, that
was my first reaction.)
Then consider the following
sketch which characterizes differ-
ences in our environment to that
of our ancestors. What follows is
pseudoscientific, highly caricatured
and may never be substantiated by
future research, but adopting this
way of thinking can have a real
effect on how you live your life.

In evolution it's survival that
matters, and the greatest threat to
survival for much of our history
has been other large predators -
the kind that may not have oppos-
able thumbs or tool use, but are
armed with super-sharp teeth that
more than make up for those minor
inconveniences. Obviously, reacting
quickly to those threats is highly
beneficial and requires some super-
efficient neural machinery. This
fight-or-flight response is essen-
tially an activation of the limbic
system that takes over for the more
recently evolved executive atten-
tion networks in the frontal cortex.
This feature was great in the plains
of our past but is less helpful today.
The central problem is that the
fear response, which shuts down
our higher cognitive processes, still
responds to stimuli all the time, but
at times that response can be mal-
adaptive. A recent World Health
organization study of noise pollu-
tion in Europe found that one mil-
lion years of healthy life is lost to
high levels of noise. Much of the
ischemic heart disease and cal-
culated loss of life results from
this fight-or-flight system firing in
response to loud sounds. But it also
activates in response to social cues.
Neuro-imaging has shown us
that words that sound threaten-
ing such as "contaminate," "perse-
cute," and "whisper" activate the
amygdala - the root of aggression

and a generating source of fight-
or-flight behavior. It's important to
note also that this isn't necessarily
a conscious process. You could have
higher levels of stress hormones,
decreased executive control and
generally be in a fear response state
and not even be aware that you're
agitated.
If even simple words that we
associate with danger can evoke
this response, then, surely, getting
a poor grade or being reprimanded
for poor performance can do some-
thing similar. The way our aca-
demic system and our society are
structured makes our reputation
a virtual extension of ourselves,
meaning that an injury to our repu-
tation is perceived as a direct insult
to the self. Putting ourselves out
there for the world to see makes us
vulnerable, and when we're vulner-
able, we're scared.
The next time you find your
hands shaking before a class pre-
sentation, or find yourself lost in
the Twitter-verse for hours with-
out being able to tackle that essay,
consider what may be happening
in your brain. "Not wanting" to do
something could just be a retro-
spective analysis assigned by your
fore-brain when it is literally not
able to act - it's held captive by
your fearful amygdala.

Offering residents quality educational
opportunities is one of the principle public
goods all local governments should provide.
Community colleges respond to these needs in
a waythat no other post-secondary educational
institution can, allowing education at schools
with open admissions, low tuition rates and
eclectic course offerings. These underrated
institutions are serving the need for rapid voca-
tional training and equipping people with the
skills necessary to enter an increasingly tumul-
tuous job market.
While proposing the issuance of bonds or
the imposition of new millage rates is rela-
tively simple in legislative terms, the propos-
al wording is somewhat vague, saying only
that the school will equip, reequip and refur-
bish buildings, sites and infrastructure. But
this vague nature can most likely be attrib-
uted to restraints and requirements of legal
language. To propose the millage, one need
only specify the amount to be borrowed, the
millage rate to be levied and a date for it to be
paid off, and also give voters a general notion
of its purpose. To their credit, community
colleges seeking funds have tried to inform

voters where exactly the funds go.
Though as University students we have
opportunity and privilege to attend a four-
year university program, we must recognize
that this option is not possible for everyone.
This proposal services low-income areas and
also allows graduates to pursue new interests
with less financial risk. Macomb County Com-
munity College alone fulfills the needs of more
than 59,000 students annually, providing a
comprehensive post-secondary education to
non-traditional students.
Improving schools through education and
renovation also tends to increase the property
value of the surrounding area, which would
increase the rate at which the school could
honor its financial commitment. This ulti-
mately strengthens the economy's social and
economic environments.
Given the ever-growing demand for educat-
ed workers and the increased cost of a four-year
university education, community colleges will
play an important role in the future of higher
education. A number of them are on the ballot
this year, preparing for that future. And their
success will benefit all involved.


Don't knock Housing
TO THE DAILY:
I was disappointed to see the
accusations levied against Univer-
sity housing by columnist James
Brennan ("Dorm Room Drama"
10/22/12). While I absolutely agree
that the residence halls are a great
place to build community at the
University, Brennan paints too sim-
plistic an argument when it comes
to the cost of room and board. Bren-
nan argues that the University rips
off freshmen and "overcharges"
students who pay room and board
in the system.
Brennan enjoys living in the reno-

vated Mosher-JordanResidence Hall.
That renovation is partly paid for by a
portion of room and board rates. The
individuals who cook the meals at the
Hill Dining Center and the staff that
ensures the building is clean and safe
are all paid for by - you guessed it -
room and board rates.
As a former Hall Director in the
system, I know University housing
has a policy of paying its employees
living wages and offering benefits
like insurance plans. While I sympa-
thize with Brennan's financial situa-
tion, I wish he'd take the time to look
deeper into the numbers. Yes, $1L43
for a meal mayseem like alot,but that
supports locally sourced food, cooks
who earn more than minimum wage

and housing staff who help build the
strong sense of community in our resi-
dence halls.
The University and its many
departments must find ways to
minimize cost increases and work
to make this place as affordable as
possible for students. But before we
go around demonizing offices and
accusing them of not having the
students's best interest at heart, we
should pause and take a moment to
go beyond simple and easy explana-
tions, Anything less is a disservice
to the education we all receive at
this fine institution.

Romney lea
Sorry Mr. President, touring college cam-
puses in battleground states does not equate
to fixing America's failing education system.
President Barack Obama has broken promises to
replace No Child Left Behind and tackle the ris-
ing cost of college education. Instead, following
the theme of his 2008 campaign, he prefers to
just throw -money at the problem and "hope" it
will go away.
Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney
is a proven leader in education, with Massachu-
setts's education system ranking number one in
the nation during his time as governor. As presi-
dent, Romney would improve K-12 education by
supporting teachers - not teachers unions - and
reforming No Child Left Behind. He'd also alle-
viate college debt by controlling the skyrocket-
ing costs of college tuition and creating jobs for
young people once they graduate.
Finland, one of the world's highest-ranked
countries in education, succeeds because of its
investment in teachers, not teachers unions.
While American teachers unions - supported
by the Democratic Party - argue that higher
salaries lead to improved education, this isn't the
case. In 2008, the average salary for a teacher in
Finland was the equivalent of $29,000, while in
the United States it was $36,000.
Charter schools - free of union control - con-
sistently rank higher than public schools because
they invest in teacher improvement, not outra-
geous pension plans. In addition, charter schools
can fire and hire teachers as they please, while
most public schools are bound by strict ten-
ure rules that make firing bad teachers nearly
impossible. For these reasons, Romney supports
allowing charter schools to thrive, especially in
inner-city areas, and giving parents the choice
of where to enroll their children. Romney wants
states to focus on investing in teachers, not teach-
ers unions, and part of this strategy includes
reforming No Child Left Behind.
Within public schools, Romney wants to
reform No Child Left Behind by giving teachers

would have changed the lives of thousands who

When banks became less willing to lend after
the 2008 financial crisis, the president elimi-
nated federal student loan subsidies to banks and
passed legislation that put the government in
charge of issuing all federal student loans. This
switch saved the government billions by elimi-
nating the middleman and giving the president
enough money to expand Pell Grants.
Romney opposes this policy and has said he
would return the power to distribute federal
student loans to banks. He doesn't support the
expansion of Pell Grants, saying in his education
policy blueprint that the program is a result of the
"entitlement mentality" of this country. Romney
has made it clear that you should only go to col-
lege if you possess the financial means to do so,
showing a lack of understanding for the issues
college students face today. Moreover, in affirm-
ing his support of No Child Left Behind, Romney
is setting out to widen the opportunity gap at all
levels of education for disadvantaged students.
Obama has remained a consistent advocate for
American students. His record shows a dedica-
tion to raising teaching standards and ensuring
schools are pursing policies to help students in
the future. He shows a dedication to students and
supports our dreams of achieving academic suc-
cess and post-graduate employment. The presi-
dent has made plans to create a teacher corps
focused on improving education in science and
math during his next term and has promised to
pursue policies to increase college affordability.
Obama's dedication to improving the quality of
America's schools is unwavering. The next four years
will see a continuation of his already stellar record
of building effective schools and expanding oppor-
tunities for students to achieve their academic goals.
Obamahas the proven record and vision necessary to
move our nation's educational system forward.

defense has been mediocre,
allowing 143 yards per game,
but it has fared much better in
recent weeks. In its three confer-
ence games, the Wolverines have
surrendered just 91 yards on the
ground per game.
On the other side of the ball,
Nebraska's front seven hasn't
done as great a job, and Robin-
son should see some open field
on Saturday. The Cornhusker
rushing defense ranks lOth in the
Big Ten, giving up 188 yards per
game. And being that Nebraska's
secondary is very effective, Rob-
inson should be more inclined
either to keep it himself or hand

off to redshirt junior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint on
most snaps.
"I don't think they play a
high-risk, high-reward type of
defense," said offensive coordi-
nator Al Borges. "They're basi-
cally in the right position most of
the time. Their coverage is sound.
They don't do anything that you
look and say, 'Oh my God, we can
take advantage of that."'
But Borges was able to take
advantage of Nebraska's defense
last season, when Michigan
toppled the Big Ten-newcomer,
45-17, at the Big House. Robinson
and Toussaint combined for 221
rushing yards and four touch-
downs, and.Robinson added two
more touchdowns through the
air.
One of the biggest factors
in Saturday's game will be the
gameday atmosphere. As Michi-
gan fans found out last season,
Nebraska fans, dubbed the Sea
of Red, travel very well - an
indication that they'll show up
in droves for a key home match-
up against the Wolverines. And
Michigan hates the color red.

Michigan could
finish unbeaten at
home with win over
Fighting Illini
By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Writer
It's a scene that has played out
at every home game this season.
The catchy tune of the latest
pop hit blasts through the crisp
fall air at the U-M Soccer Com-
plex. On the pitch, members of
the Michigan women's soccer
team bounce from left to right,
dancing and
laughing. loi

the Wolverines Complex
(7-1-2 Big Ten,
13-3-2 overall)
are undefeated at home. In the
process, they have outscored
opponents 21-3, recorded six
shutouts, and they have defeated
three opponents in overtime.
On Sunday night, No. 24
Michigan will host Illinois in
the friendly confines of the U-M
Soccer Complex with a chance
to guarantee the No. 2 seed in
the Big Ten Tournament. With
a win, or a tie, the Wolverines
will become just the second
team in the program's history
to complete an undefeated home
schedule.
For the Wolverines to beat the-
Fighting Illini, they will have to
slow down Vanessa DiBernardo.
The midfielder leads Illinois
(5-4-1, 8-7-2) with six goals and
an assist this season, including a
hat trick against Michigan State

earlier this month.
At just 5-foot-4, the diminu-
tive junior won't pose much of
a threat in the air, but her speed
will force Michigan's defense
to be cautious when she has the
ball.
When the Wolverines attack,
they will face a struggling back
line that has surrendered two or
more goals in four of its last five
contests.
During that stretch, the
Fighting Illini dropped three
games and fell to sixth in the
conference. The defense is led
by goalkeeper Steph Panozzo,
the 2011 Big Ten Tournament
defensive MVP.
If Michigan earns a win, it
will finish second in the confer-
ence - its best result since 2002.
If it loses, it will finish third,
unless Ohio State also loses its
game at Indiana. And if the Wol-
verines tie, it will take a Buck-
eye victory to drop Michigan to
third.
But regardless of Sunday's
result against the Illini, the
match will mark the last home
contest of a successful 2012 cam-
paign. Just as it's done all year,
the team will face the stands and
begin to chant "The Victors."
The fans who pack the U-M
Soccer Complex will join them,
their breath visible in the chilly
October air.
As the Wolverines jog into
their locker room for the last
time this season, children will
hold handmade signs over the
railing and ask for autographs,
just as they have all year.
Parents will smile and wave
and yell their congratulations.
Music will blare out of the
speakers.
And as the minutes pass, the
music will shut off, the parents
will escort their children out to
the parking lot, and the mur-
mur of the crowd will lessen
until silence and a brightly illu-
minated soccer field are all that
remain.

listed freshman guard Brandi

"It's really about getting the

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
ROSEMONT, Ill. - In 1968,
when John Beilein was living
in upstate New York, he never
would've predicted he'd one day
be rooting for the Detroit Lions
in a World Series.
The Tigers had just broken his
10 year-old heart by knocking
off Bob Gibson and his beloved
St. Louis Cardinals. Beilein, who
decided to become a Cardinals
fan five years earlier in 1963,
also had no idea that one day
he'd become close friends with
the St. Louis manager.
Beilein, still a devoted Cardi-
nals fan, has struck up a friend-
ship with St. Louis manager and
former Michigan baseball player
Mike Matheny. When the Car-
dinals visited Comerica Park
this summer during interleague
play, Beilein paid a visit to the
ballpark to spend time with his
friend, and the two remained in
contact even through Matheny's
recent playoff grind, which
ended in a Game 7 loss to San
Francisco earlier this week.
"One of the texts I sent him
after a game - they'd won a
big game - and I said, 'Now
you've got to hurry to get home
to watch the Michigan football
game,' " Beilein said Thursday
at Big Ten Media Day. "He loves
Michigan, but he does a good job
with the Cardinals."
Matheny played three sea-
sons in Ann Arbor before
leaving in 1989 to pursue a pro-
fessional career. In the midst of
his 13-year career, he won four
Gold Gloves and holds the MLB
catching records for most games
(252) and chances (1,565) with-
out committing an error, but he
accomplished one of his proud-
est feats off the field.

Michigan coach John Beilein is a lifelong St. Louis Cardinals fan.

Matheny returned to Ann
Arbor in each of his first two
off-seasons asa professional and
completed his final 42 credits,
becoming the first person in his
family to earn a degree from a
major university.
"I didn't want to throw all
that away, and I knew as I got
older, it'd be harder to come
-back," Matheny said in 2011
after speaking at the Michi-
gan baseball team banquet. "Of
the things that I've been able
to accomplish in my life - and
some of them were bigger than
I ever thought I would - I can't
tell you how many times I've
gone into a conversation and
stuck my chest out a little bit
when somebody asked me where
I went to school.
"When I see their reaction, I
know that I was right inthe deci-
sion that I made. I truly want the
message to ring clear that this is
a very, very special place, and it's
developing very special people"

Beilein said that as he watched
the Cardinals this year, he
noticed that leadership attribut-
ed to Matheny's Ann Arbor days
remained instilled in how the
first-year coach manages.
"He's such a great representa-
tion of what a Michigan Man is,"
Beilein said.
"Just watch his press confer-
ences and how he talks to the
press, how he deals with his
players, it's Michigan. It's just
Michigan. He has a great calm-
ing influence on his players, and
his team plays with great confi-
dence because of it."
Beilein, who has also gotten
to know former St. Louis man-
ager Tony LaRussa over the
years, didn't close the door on
the possibility of Matheny pay-
ing a visit to the basketball team
in Ann Arbor.
But don't expect anything to
materialize before the Wolver-
ines kick off their season in a
week.

When Matsuev premiered for

instantaneous and total standing
ovation by every person its Hill,
even though it was in the middle
of the concert, explained Kondzi-
olka.
In the concert companion for
the show, the Shostakovich is
about clashing musical styles. It
describes how the opening, after
flourish and fanfare, is melodic
and lyrical. This is followed by
a quick-tempoed second theme,
which crashes into a second
movement that sways like a "mel-
ancholic waltz," From here the
piece moves to an unaccompa-
nied piano prelude before quickly
descending into a furious Allegro
con brio.
Before the complex journey of
the concerto, the concert opens
with Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's
Life), an 1898 piece by Richard
Strauss. Strauss, who bridged
the end of the 19th century into
the first 40 years of the 20th
century, was famous for com-
posing Opera's and tone poems,
explained Kondziolka.
"What the tone poem Ein
Heldenleben is, is essentially the
name given to a large piece of
orchestral music that is telling a
story though or conveying a con-
cept through music. It was an
exceedingly 'modern' form for
composing at the turn of the cen-
tury," Kondziolka explained.
"This piece by Strauss meant
to evoke through music this
idea of the heroic figure, one
on a journey," Kondziolka said.
"And the unbelievable thing
about Strauss is that he wrote
like no other composer for a
large orchestra. All of his tone
poems for orchestra show off
the orchestra in a way that no
one else does; he shows fwhat
a- big, romantic size orchestra
can do - and it is an impressive
openingto the concert."

From Pge 1
his favorite color, cheesy poses
and microphones that engulf half
his face like the local TV stations.
Instead, I'm interested in Drew.
And who is Drew?
His eyes light up, a smile etch-
es across his face, and he leans
back in his chair. "He's this crazy
kid willing to do anything at any
moment."
It's this crazy kid - the one who
said high school "went too easy,"
the one who needed to find a way
to stay entertained, the one who
proudly wore purple booty shorts
to his high school spirit week, the
one who always pushed the enve-
lope - who pushed it a bit too far.
He talks about his accident in
his essay application to the Uni-
versity, titled "The Date of My
Accident." In addition to playing
on the football team in his home-
town of Commerce, Mich,, he was
a trombone player in the band and
earned a role in his school's theat-
rical production of "Seussical: The
Musical" during his sophomore
year.
During rehearsals for the
performance, his high school
director asked if anyone had any
special talents to add to the per-
formance, and Drew claimed he
could do a backflip. Though he had
never actually done one before,
he rehearsed several times with
his friend's mother who owned a
dance studio, and the first time he
d;d te fln withou her hein mwas

while "goofing off" in the hallway
after school. Little did he know
then it would also be his last.
Drew doesn't remember what
happened next. In fact, he doesn't
remember the first week in the
hospital, thanks to the drugs that
helped ease his pain.
What he later learned is this:
He landed on and broke his back,
rolled over and threw up. He then
received CPR from his freshman
football coach until paramedics
came. He was unable to breathe on
his own for an hour until the para-
medics put a tracheotomy tube
down this throat, and was then
airlifted to University Hospital,
which would become his home for
the next three months.
As he recalls the story, he jokes
in typical Drew fashion that he
wishes he had remembered the
transport since it was the only
time he's been in a helicopter.-
Though much of the first week
remains a blur, his father, LeDon
Clayborn recalls that every time
Drew would wake up, he would ask
what happened and apologized for
what he had done. It wasn't until a
week after the accident that Drew
finally remembered. A nurse told
him. Straightforward. Just the
facts.
His initial thought was relief.
He would probably get an exten-
sion on his English essay that was
due. But after that realization,
the permanence set in and Drew
accepted the inevitable.
Hs n nralrzed

When asking others about their
impressions of Drew, they often
talk about his strength and inde-
pendent attitude, which might
seem ironic due to his need for
24-hour care.
For his family, it seems as
though Drew's lack of burdening
self-pity propels the entire family
past the experience.
"I think he still wants to prove
to his dad he could do whatever he
thinks I want him to. He's striv-
ing to be independent and to grow
with life," LeDon says.
"The whole family moved
forward because Drew moved
forward," his 19-year-old sister
Desirae explains.
His nurse, Kandi Epifanio, is
his arms and legs. But everything
else is Drew. She recalls his cour-
age in the wake of his accident.
"He turned to me and said
he was glad that this happened
to him and no one in his family
because he could handle it," she
said. "He's not resentful for what
happened. He's done everything
but given up."
His confidence is contagious.
In all the time I've spent with
him the past few months, I've
never seen him falter. While there
are occasional fallen moments,
Epifanio says they are more out
of frustration - days when the
simplest things others take for
granted become a small battle,
like itchy noses and watery eyes.

witnessed was Drew's recollec-
tion of a conversation he had with
his mother, in which she revealed
after the accident she had strug-
gled with whether or not to abort
him when she was pregnant with
him.
Drew's voice grows quiet and
he pauses. His already scratchy
voice drops to a whisper and his
eyes bow down before glancing
my way.
"I told her that she probably
should have," he says.
When Iask if he often truly feels
that way, he responds: "I mean, it's
out of truth for everyone's sake."
However, a stranger walking
into this household doesn't get
that sense of despair. It's a home
and family built on love. A place
where LeDon's booming laugh
fills the house at any given time
and Drew's wheezy laugh is heard
from his ground-floor bedroom.
When Drew finds out his first
Math 115, Calculus I exam score
is an A-minus, the house fills with
cheers - "Welcome to college!
That's the Michigan Difference"
- and Drew beams, but not with-
out a slight jab at himself for the
minus.
Would I necessarily ask an
incoming freshman that isn't par-
alyzed what they hoped their leg-
acy on campus would be? Maybe.
Maybe not. But suddenly, the idea
that he's a survivor seems to over-
shadow the other aspects of his
life. Of course, he's an incredible
vision of courage, but he's also an
18-year-old
boy and a
freshman in
college try-
ing to figure
life out.
What I
j can tell you
is this: The
medical
equipment
tin his bed-
roomis over-
powered by
a large styl-
ized print
of Jay-Z
that adorns
his wall.
He tapes
"The Ellen
DeGeneres
Show" dur-
ing the day
to watch at
night, and he

loves "South Park." He's an infor-
matics major who cringes at the
thought of taking his freshman
writing seminar next semester.
He dreams of one day working
for Apple or Google and would do
just about anything to get closer
to that dream.
"Shoot, I'd dress up like Steve
Jobs. I'd just be a Steve Jobs
model to be around people that
smart and who are able to make
that kind of technology," he says.
Above all, his sense of humor
has carried him through the
experience. His senior quote,
after all, was "Don't Think, Just
Jump.".
But with his story comes the
added burden of being deemed an
inspirational figure, something
most freshmen in' college don't
have to worry about.
"I usually just smile and say
thank you. I don'tknow how quite
to respond. My entire life I've been
a go-on-er, just a pusher. If people
find that inspiring, that's great,"
he says.
Due to financial constraints
and the state of Michigan's insur-
ance policies related to nursing,
Drew cannot afford 24/7 care in
Ann Arbor and must live at home.
Drew received a full tuition schol-
arship from the University and
has a room set up in Alice Lloyd
Residence Hall for which the fam-
ily can't currently afford nursing.
In order to get Drew on campus,,
the family needs to raise an aver-
age of $1,000 a week to hire one
full time and one part time nurse
for extra nursing care.
The family is hosting a fund-
raising event, a SK run on Sun-
day, Oct. 28 in Novi, which the
family had hoped would raise the
$30,000 needed for one semester's
worth of additional nursing. But
with low registration numbers,
they're working on salvaging the
money invested in the race and
working toward another future
fundraiser.
Until he gets the money, he will
continue to commute from Com-
merce, about a 40-minute drive
to campus. Though the comimute
isn't bad, and Drew has season
football tickets, he said it's still
difficult to receive e-mails about
campus events he can't participate
in.
The first thing most people
might notice about Drew is his
chair, but in academia, the Univer-

sity isn't giving him an easy way
out. Homework assignments are
expected to be turned in on time,
and his exams are the same day as
everyone else.
"They've just made it seem like
I'm a normal person," he com-
mented.
Instead, something he has to
deal with is;a different kind of first
impression. While most might
see him in the chair and hear the.
equipment's buzz, Drew has his
own methods for asserting his{
individuality.
"A lot of the time I will have to
put a little something in, so they
don't look down on me. There's
nothing mentally wrong with me
and I want to-make sure they real-
ize that. I might say something
reallysmart," he says.
He also recalls on one occa-
sion during the beginning of the
semester, when his computer pro-
gramming teacher, not cognizant
of the details of his accident or his
level of mobility, treated him def-
erentially.
The next class Drew went early
and the two talked his accident,
and since then he says there's been
a noticeable difference in the way
the professor speaks to him.
Drew's best friend, Lyndsay
Burke, an LSA and School of
Music, Theatre & Dance fresh-
man, said school is an important
part of Drew's life and a form of
assertinghis self-sufficiency.
"He cherishes whatever inde-
pendence he can get," she says.
Despite his physical challenges,
there is a possibility that his inde-
pendence could grow, and he still
holds onto that hope. Thanks to
current advancements in technol-
ogy, there is the possibility that
in three to four years he could be
off the ventilator, or even walking
again, and he says he's even start-
ing to feel some sensations in his
body.
Until then, he'll continue mov-
ing forward by concentrating on
maintaining his calculus grade
and cheering for Team 133. He's
more than just his story of cour-
age.
But in describing himself, Drew
still puts it best. He's not first and
foremost a Wolverine, and he's not
just a survivor. He's just himself.
"The one thing I've always just
kind of stuck with is to make sure
that I'm just Drew still. I'm still
just Drew. This hasn't changed me
at all."

CCHA CONTENDERS

Notre Dame
Ranked first in the preseason
CCHA coaches poll, the Fighting
Irish (3-1) hope that rankingholds
true as the season progresses. They
have started out the season with
an impressive series split against
reigning-national champion Min-
nesota.
No. 9 Notre Dame lost just four
players to graduation last season.
Forwards Anders Lee and T.J.
Tynan - the top-two point lead-
ers who combined for 75 total
points last year - both return to
lead a strong and efficient offensive
attack. Both players were named to
the CCHA Preseason First Team.
Last season, goalie Steven Sum-,
merhays posted a 10-8 record in
20 appearances between the pipes.
This year, the junior has allowed
just 1.51 goals per game in four
appearances.
The Fighting Irish finished just
above .500 a year ago, but after a
quick start, they're surely hoping to
find more success this year.
Head coach Jeff Jackson is in his
eighth year at the helm and after
missing the NCAA Tournament
in 2012, hopes to get his team back
there.
FRST LOOK: Notre Dame at
Michigan, Nov. 15-16.

Miami (Ohio)
The third-ranked RedHawks are
the highest ranked CCHA team in
the nation. Despite their pre-sea-
son ranking of fourth in the CCHA
coaches poll, the RedHawks have
made big strides early on, starting
the year with a 3-0-1 record. They'll
look to reach a little farther than last
year's opening-round exit from the
NCAA Tournament.
One question mark for Miami is
the goaltender position. Last year,
the RedHawks platooned two goal-
ies,butbotharegone andhead coach
Enrico Blasi, who is starting his 14th
season in charge, has two freshmen
goalies on his hands. It appears he
will use a new platoon, but as Michi-
gan has also experienced so far this
year, freshmen in net can be unreli-
able.
Miami not only lost forwards
Reilly Smith and Tyler Biggs to the
locked-out NHL this past year, but
also has a roster with 11 new fresh-
men. The roster overhaul could lead
to some question marks as the sea-
son progresses.Austin Czarnik, who
finished second in points last season
is a definite positive for Miami. The
sophomore forward is tied for the
teain lead in points with five.
FIRST LOOK: Miami at Michi-
gan, Friday and Saturday.

Western Michigan
Last season the Broncos had a
new coach in Andy Murray and
some questions to answer. But
after the Broncos defeated Michi-
gan in the CCHA Finals last year
to earn just their second-ever
NCAA Tournament berth, Mur-
ray's stock rose.
Goaltender Frank Slubowski,
who shared the duties last year,
has been given the nod this sea-
son.,
The CCHA pre-season first-
team selection has lived up to the
hype, giving up just seven goals in
four appearances this year.
The' Broncos' -(3-1) two lead-
ing scorers, and forwards Chase
Balisy and Shane Berschbach,
combined for 69 points last sea-
son, both return to lead a vicious
attack. Coming off a season that
saw him notch a second-team All-
American selection, defenseman
Dan DeKeyser will anchor the
Western Michigan back line.
The Broncos jumped back into
the top-10 last weekend after
sweeping Canisius. DeKeyser was
named CCHA defenseman of the
week on Monday, his first such
honor of the season.
FIRST LOOK: Western Michigan
at Michigan, Dec. 14-15.

Ferris State

The Bulldogs are coming off of
their most successful season in
the history of the program. They
captured their first CCHA regu-
lar-season championship and also
used a late-season run to make it
to their first Frozen Four.
Ferris State lost point-leader
Jordie Johnston and scoring
defenseman Chad Billins, but
the Bulldogs still boast a strong
lineup. Coach Bob Daniels will
play a first-year starter in net
with sophomore C.J. Motte, who
started only 12 games last season.
Defenseman Scott Czarnowczan,
a CCHA-preseason honorable
mention, will lead a Ferris State
defense that returns most of its
core.
Despite the high preseason
hopes, Ferris State has started the
year just 1-1-2. The Bulldogs come
into the week ranked 18th nation-
ally, even with their most recent
struggles.
The Bulldogs will certainly face
an uphill battle to retain their Big
Ten regular-season crown, with
early-season matchups against
Alaska (Fairbanks), Miami (Ohio)
and Michigan.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan at Ferris
State, Nov. 30-Dec. 1.

Northern Michigan
one of the underrated teams in
the CCHA, the 16th-ranked Wild-
cats are hoping to let loose a growl
heard round the conference this
season. After a sweep of Green Bay-
Wisconsin and a split with Nebras-
ka-Omaha, Northern Michigan's 3-1
record looks to be a good starting
place.
Besides alopsided 5-2 loss against
Nebraska-Omaha, the stingy Wild-
cat defense has allowed just one goal
per game.
This is due to a back line that
returned all six starters. Pre-season
second-team All-American selec-
tion Kyle Follmer highlights the
defense, along with standout C.J.
Ludwig.
The defense also will receive sig-
nificant help from goaltender Jared
Coureau, who allowed 2.2 goals per
game last year. During Northern
Michigan's three contests, he has an
impressive 0.913 save percentage.
And though the Wildcats received
a CCHA preseason No. 8 rank-
ing, they look ready to take on the
deep conference. The lack of offen-
sive production and the unyielding
defense thus far has given them a
little bit of a sleeper feel.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan at
Northern Michigan, Nov. 2-3.

sound two-way player he's become
and that Berenson adores.
"He's a strong two-way player,"
Bandel said. "He's added a strong
element of defensive play to his
game, which complements his
offensive skills. He's going to have
a good opportunity to play on the
big team one day."
Zach wasn't supposed to be
there, arms extended triumphant-
ly, being swallowed up by his
teammates.
His dad and Spencer weren't
supposed to be up there in the club
level, exuberant.

hockey team is comfortably ahead

of opposing Bentley. His line-
mates, two freshmen, swarm him,
grateful for his contagious work
ethic.
The scene - Zach lighting the
lamp - isn't what's unique, but
rather the backdrop is. It took
some twists of fate for him to end
up in Ann Arbor, instead of Hobey
Baker Rink - a barn that predates
even Yost on Princeton's campus.
But now Michigan, as his moth-
er Vicky says, "is like a home to
him."
Now that he's here, he won't
leave until his time's up.
"He wants to play for Red for
four years," Stu said. "He's not
going early. Zach's going to be
there the whole time, all the way
through."
That's just the kind of person
he's always been - patient, know-
ing his NHL dream comes closer
to fruition with each passing day.

draft day - the day his NHL
dream became a tangible real-
ity.
The long wait had ended.
At the other end of the stage, a
Florida Panthers executive held
out the red, blue and gold sweat-
&r that would become his own.
It took five rounds of selec-
tions and 11 years since Stu
made that promise to his son at
Maple Leaf Gardens, but it had
finally happened. The NHL was
in sight, but then came the fork
in the road that so many top
junior players before him had
experienced - NCAA or OHL?
For Zach, it was a non-deci-
sion decision.
"I don't even remember one
instance when the OHL popped
into my mind when I was mak-
ing a decision," said Zach, who
committed to Princeton Uni-
versity at just 15. "I didn't ever
really think about the OHL."
Zach had been a member
of the Florida Panthers orga-
nization for no more than 15
minutes, and he had already
described himself as a "power
forward" who "loves to crash
the net" in an interview with
the Panthers' website. He didn't
realize it then, but he'd be a
completely different player in
two years time.
In April 2011, Zach was back
at the Staples Center in Los
Angeles, taking ina Kings game.
While he watched, he hoped he
would get the chance to play
there one day.
During the game, he got word
that Princeton head coach Guy
Gadowsky was interviewing for
the same job at Penn State. Zach
didn't think much of the news -
he believed Guy would be there
when he stepped foot on cam-
pus that fall.
The next day, Zach and Spen-
cer unwound in the living room
of their grandfathers' California
home. Zach spanned to atten-
tion asa television anchor broke
the news that altered his future.
"And the new head coach of
the Penn State hockey team is
Guy Gadowsky."
Zach's jaw dropped.
Not two minutes later, the
phone rang. Gadowsky was on
the other end. Somehow, Zach
managed to get words out.
"It was shock," Zach's mom
Vicky recalled. "Zach was one
of the first ones he called."
Zach and Gadowsky were
close. Vicky said his decision to
originally commit to Princeton

"came down to Guy."
There was a comfort level
between the two of them that
would make many coaches envi-
ous. It takes, a special kind of
relationship to get akid to com-
mit at only 15, as Zach did.
"He told me the news and he
felt really bad because of the sit-
uation I was in and the relation-
ship we had," Zach said. "It was
four years in the making that I
was going to go play for him and
that school."
Tollowing Gadowsky to
Penn State wasn't ever a seri-
ous option. The Nittany Lions
would still be a club-level team
for another season, and Zach
didn't want totake another year
off, like he did in 2010-11 to play
in Hamilton.
When he committed to Princ-
eton at 15, he started a trend of
early hockey commitments by
doing so. But Zach's recruit-
ment was suddenly wide open,
just four months before he had
planned on arriving at Princ-
eton.
"As soon as he decommitted,
it was overwhelming," Vicky
said. "You got a taste of what
movie stars go through. They
were fighting for him."
It's 10 hours from the
Hyman's Forest Hill neighbor-
hood in the heart of Toronto
to Boston. Stu's phone rang for
nearly half the drive as he drove
his two oldest sons to Boston
College and Boston University.
Zach had a decision to make,
and everyone wanted to see him
before he made it.
"Every 10 minutes, the phone
rang," Spencer said. "Norm
Bazin (head coach at UMass-
Lowell) was like, 'Stop by on
your way.' UMass called. Maine,
we went to. North Dakota, Min-
nesota - they all wanted us to
come."
Some of the schools never
stood a chance. The family nar-
rowed the decision down to the
Boston and Michigan areas,
largely because of the great aca-
demic reputations for the Ivy
League-caliber student.
On the way back from Bos-
ton, with Boston University the
clear leader in the clubhouse,
the Hymans detoured to Ann
Arbor for a stop.a
It would be their last.
Zach and Spencer sat across
from Red Berenson in the
coach's office, while Berenson
laid out why they should be
Wolverines. It didn't take long.
"Ten minutes into Michigan,
we had completely forgotten

about every other school," Spen-
cer said. "It was over. Zach and
I were sitting in the (Ross Aca-
demic Center) and we looked at
each other and it was like, 'Yeah,
we're going to Michigan."
When Zach arrived in Ann
Arbor in fall 2011, his suitors
were still pleading. The OHL
executives kept calling.
"In Michigan, right 'at the
beginning of the year, we were
getting offers for him to go,"
Stu recalled. "Guys were saying
'Red's not playing him properly,'
and 'He's a goal scorer but he's
playing defensive forward' and
'I can take Zach to the NHL.'
"We just said 'Thanks a lot.' "
At the start of last season,
though, the puck just wasn't
going in for Zach. He heard
metal after seemingly every
shot - frustrating after scor-
ing basically at will the season
before.
Berenson has been coach of
the year in the NHL before. He
knows the type of forward that
today's game demands. If you're
going to be a part of his pro-
gr'am, you're going to play sound
two-way hockey.
Berenson met with Zach and
told him he wanted to see more
of a two-way game out of him.
Don't worry about the points,
Berenson told the natural goal-
scorer.
Zach's not the first to have
that conversation with Beren-
son. He certainly won't be the
last. But he has bought into the
system as well as anyone in pro-
gram history.
His dad compares him to
Luke Glendening - last season's
captain and the type of team-
first leader that every locker
room needs but not every one
can have. Zach scored only nine
points last year compared to 102
the year before in Hamilton. He
played only two more games in
Hamilton than at Michigan.
"I would've liked to have had
more of an offensive impact,"
Zach said. "But in the NHL, if
you can't play defense, you can't
play. You need to be a two-way
player in the NHL nowadays."
Fred Bandel, the amateur
scout for the Florida Panthers
responsible for Michigan,
hadn't seen Zach before the
draft. So his description of Zach
as a player reflects only on his
development as a Wolverine.
And you can't tell from his input
that Zach wasn't always the

Michigan can own the CCHA in its final season

will own the CCHA?
OK, no one team can
own a conference. But
come March 23 when the CCHA
crowns its last-ever tournament
champion at Joe Louis Arena,
which of the 11 teams best deserves
to keep the Mason Cup?
There are two teams it's histori-
cally been easiest to argue for.
One is Michigan State. The
Spartans' 10 Mason Cups outnum-
ber any other
team in the _
league. It also
doesn't hurt
that the Cup's
namesake, Ron
Mason, left his 4
legacy in East
Lansing as the
winningest col- LIZ
legiate hockey VUKELICH
coach in NCAA
history with
924 career wins.
And then there's No. 6 Michigan
- nine Mason Cups and 11 regular-
season championships.
There's little doubt in Michigan
coach Red Berenson's mind about
who the CCHA belongs to.
"I think Michigan ... (has) been
a big part of the backbone of the
CCHA," Berenson said. "It's been
our league. That's the league that
we play in and every year we talk
about trying to win the CCHA
title."
You know winning the confer-

ence is in the back of each coach
and players' mind. But how real-
istic is one last Mason Cup for
Michigan?
There's a lot about this team to
like. There's the defensive corps
with decent depth. Forget the
injury to junior Jon Merrill for a
minute - the team survived half of
last season without him just fine,
and it'll do it again this year.
You've got two captains who
proved last season they can lead the
blue liners in points. There's fresh-
man Jacob Trouba, who's already
shown he's able to slam opponents
into the boards and score goals.
Yeah, there's going to be a learn-
ing curve for some of the other
defensemen. But that's where hav-
ing Mac Bennett and Lee Moffie
around comes in handy.

As for the forwards, it's hard to
judge who will be the go-to guy
after just three games. But already
there's A.J. Treais, the epitome of
the Michigan grind-it-out work
ethic, who usually manages to find
the back of the net.
The offense will take care of
itself - somehow, it always does.
So, what does this final Michi-
gan CCHA squad have to do to
potentially make it to the Joe?
The Wolverines are blessed with
enough talent that they don't have
to rely on one player too much -
they never have.
That will be especially clear this
season, with two freshmen com-
peting to start between the pipes.
Until Steve Racine and Jared Rut-
ledge get more comfortable in goal,
it's unrealistic to expect them to

be able to stand on their heads for
the team, at least at the beginning
of CCHA play. You can, though,
expect the rest of the players going
to extraordinary lengths to protect
the young goaltenders until they're
fully at ease in the crease.
You can talk about skill and
experience all you want, but at the
end of the day, it all comes down to
the team's want-to mentality.
Michigan will enter this sea-
son with a huge target on its back
because of poll rankings, because
it's Michigan fergodsakes, because
the Wolverines' decision to leave
for the Big Ten kick-started the col-
lapse of the conference, and there's
animosity about that.
Whether or not you see the Wol-
verines hoisting up a trophy at Joe
Louis Arena comes down to how

well they respond to that pressure
The players say all the right
things about expectations they
put upon themselves, that they
embrace Michigan's winningtra-
dition within the conference, and
that anything less than a CCHA
title would be a disappointment.
Mentally, the team is where it
needs to be, and it's usually pretty
stable as the season progresses.
Physically, though, that's where
the Wolverines have to prove them-
selves the most.
After only playingnon-confer-
ence games, it's hard to predict how
Michigan will react to the slap in
the face that is CCHA hockey. But
a lot will change from now until
March. With some conference
wins under their belts, the Wolver-
ines will hopefully find Michigan
Hockey. Playing Michigan Hockey
isn't somethingthat just happens.
The team has to make a conscious
decision to go out every night and
grind until the goals are in its favor
and the final whistle blows.
When the Wolverines play a full
60 minutes of hard-hitting, blue-
collar Michigan Hockey - well,
that's the kind of team you saw win
the Mason Cup in 2010 after com-
ing up from the conference cellar.
The Wolverines can own the
CCHA if they want to. But that's
just it - they have to want to.

Hamilton, I proved all those

said. "It helped me become

out to be the leading scorer
in the league. People didn't

Stu, who at one time
owned around 90 junior
hockey teams in addition to
Hamilton, said some skat-
ers had more on their mind
than simply trash talk.
"Coaches tell me they

in the locker room and say,

books, his children's book
"Hockey Hero" hit book-
shelves.
"We make our destiny
every day, Tommy.

Like those statistics, you
got to set your own goals,
shoot, score and make them
come true."
Zach gazed out into a
sea of 1,000 pairs of eyes at
a Greater Toronto middle
school, turning the pages
carefully of the short story-
turned-book he originally
penned for a seventh-grade
competition.
Principals call in droves
to bring Zach in to talk
about himself, his dreams
and -the importance of fol-
lowing them.
Zach's too selfless to
ask for any type of appear-
ance fee for his time. Like
his 7-year-old self with the
MVP watch, he wants to
help others. But now, the
prize isn't playing at Maple
Leaf Gardens, it's encourag-
ing others to pursue their
passions.
His baseball story, The
Bambino and Me, is in the
hands of his publisher, Ran-
dom House of Canada, and
is expected to be released in
2013.

On March 27, 2010, the
best new Ontario Hockey
League players were skat-
ing at Toronto's Master-
Card Centre, preparing for
the league's invite-only
pre-draft combine. Zach
couldn't be found, and peo-
ple were noticing.
Most households around
Ontario would have cher-
ished the - invite. Some
would have stuck it on the
refrigerator - a sight to
behold for beaming mothers
and proud fathers. Zach's
invitation went right in the
garbage bin.
Zach was the lone prized
player absent on that day, so
naturally Stu's phone rang.
"Where's Zach?" the
voice on the other end
asked.
"He's going to the
NCAA."
There are five Hyman
sons in all, the youngest of
which is Shane. Like any
9-year-old hockey player

in Ontario, Shane dreams
of the NHL. But he's got a
different idea of how to get
there.
When his hockey buddies
say they're going to play
major-junior hockey, Shane
responds, "I'm going to
Michigan." (Rob Facca, an
assistant at Western Michi-
gan, once told Stu he would
commit to the 9-year-old
already. "We'll have a lot of
publicity," Stu remembered
Facca telling him. "He'll be
the first '03 kid committed
to college.")
"The OHL comes dan-
gling and they make it really,
enticing for young kids,"
Vicky said. "But I think the
bottom line is, you need
something to fall back on.
You need an education. (The
NCAA) is becoming more
popular."
Zach strolled across the
stage where the ice typically
sits at the Staples Center in
Los Angeles. June 26, 2010,
