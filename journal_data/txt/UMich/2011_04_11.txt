U' researchers develop two
potential cancer treatments

Drug, compounds
could be effective
for treating several
types of cancer
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
In what is a significant step
forward in the field, University
researchers have uncovered two
potential ways to treat multiple

types of cancer.
Researchers at the Univer-
sity's Comprehensive Cancer
Center created a new drug that
has the potential to treat several
kinds of cancer and have also
developed new drug compounds
that have the capacity to shrink
multiple types of cancerous
tumors.
The first drug is called AT-406
and works to inhibit proteins
that prevent normal cell death
in tumors by facilitating natural
decay of harmful tissue with-

out damaging the surrounding
healthy cells, Shaomeng Wang,
the lead author of the study
said. In animal trials, the drug
has proven to reverse the block-
ing of apoptosis, or the way in
which regular cells die, which
occurs when cancerous cells are
present. Though only treated on
animals thus far, the drug also
shows promise for treating can-
cer in humans, Wang said.

tor of the Cancer Drug Discovery

Group to donate
$321,000
to American
Cancer Society
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
For a 24-hour period this
* weekend, Palmer Field was
transformed into a camp-

ground. The campers had no
intention of resting around
a campfire, but were instead
gathered to defeat cancer.
Students, local residents and
cancer survivors on Palmer
Field this weekend were part of
this year's Relay for Life at the
University, which started at 10
a.m. on Saturday morning and
ended at the same time yester-
day. The organization raised
more than $321,000 to donate
to the American Cancer Soci-

ety, exceeding its goal by about
$2,000. This year's donations
are the most Relay for Life at
the University has ever raised,
surpassing last year's total of
about $268,400.
The event kicked off with
a mix of runners and walkers
who participated in the first lap
called the Survivor Lap, which
honors and celebrates individu-
als who have beaten cancer.

By BRANDON SHAW
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan League Ball-
room became a hub of political
discussion this past weekend as
members of the Socialist Equity
Party came together to discuss

the party's current place in
national politics.
Co-sponsored by Students
for Social Equality, the World
Socialist's Website and the
SEP, the members gathered for
a conference titled "The Fight
for Socialism Today." The con-
ference is one of three annual
events, the remainder of which
are slated to occur in Los Ange-
les and New York over the next
two weeks.
The conference brought

together more than 150 people,
including the executive board of
the SEP and people from across
the country and cities in Michi-
gan, to discuss the current state
of affairs within the political
party and to vote on resolutions.
The resolutions determine the
stances the SEP will take on
various issues the party deems
relevant to the current state of
American political affairs.

Canadian Prime Minister
moving country to the right

0

Harper expected
to win third
term in May
general election
TORONTO (AP) - Back in
the days when he was an out-of-
office lawmaker with uncertain
prospects, Stephen Harper did
not need to pull his punches. His
caustic verdict on Canada still is
remembered 14 years later: "a wel-
fare state in the worst sense of the
term, and very proud of it."
Yet as prime minister and Con-
servative Party leader, he has gone
on to do what many would have
thought impossible: He has won
two elections in a row, and despite
never commanding a majority in"

Parliament, has managed to nudge
an instinctively liberal country
ever further to the right.
Now Harper looks set for a
third term when Canadians go to
the polls on May 2, and this time
he is asking voters to give him
a majority in the 308-member
house; he has been loath to do that
previously lest he be accused of
right-wing overreach. Most polls
predict he again will fall short,
although one has said he will get
his coveted majority this time.
Either way, thanks to luck, a
fractured opposition and a sharp,
strategic mind, the 51-year-old
prime minister has put a distinctly
more conservative face on the
nation of 34 million.
He has gradually lowered sales
and corporate taxes. He has forth-
rightly promoted the potential

of Alberta's oil sands, the world's
second largest oil reserves, despite
environmental objections. He has
increased spending on the mili-
tary and staunchly backed Israel's
right-wing government. He has
extended Canada's military mis-
sion in Afghanistan.
The only area that has not felt
his conservative touch is the social
one: he has said he will not tinker
with Canada's liberal abortion and
gay rights laws.
Former colleagues of Harper
say his long-term goals are to kill
the widely entrenched notion that
the Liberals - the party of MacK-
enzie King, Lester Pearson and
Pierre Trudeau - are the natural
party of government in Canada,
and to redefine what it means to
be Canadian.
"He's trying to dampen the idea
that the Liberal Party is the party
of Canada, that they invented the
flag. You can be a patriotic Cana-
dian and not be a Liberal; you can
actually be a Conservative. That's
a lasting contribution, and that
is a change," says Ian Brodie,
Harper's chief of staff from 2006
to 2008.

Obama returns to Chicago for campaign

President hopes
to recapture 2008
grassroots feel
CHICAGO (AP) - President
Barack Obama's relationship
with his hometown may be best
described as a long-distance love
affair. He lavishes attention on
it from afar and proud Chicago
pines for its hometown hero,
though the two rarely see each
other.
That looks like it's about to
change.
Obama is returning to his
roots as he embarks on his re-
election race for 2012. He's

setting up his campaign head-
quarters in a downtown high-
rise near Grant Park, the site of
his victory celebration on elec-
tion night in November 2008.
He's coming back Thursday to
raise money, a week after launch-
ing his second White House bid
with an understated email and
online video.
The president is putting Chi-
cago in the spotlight again as he
tries to recreate the grass-roots,
start-up flavor of his first cam-
paign and do what no incumbent
president has done in decades:
try to win re-election from a
location outside Washington.
A Chicago base also could
reinforce a connection to a city

that aides say keeps Obama
grounded while he lives in the
nation's capital.
"Nobody is more eager to be
out and nobody is more eager to
be here than him," said David
Axelrod, Obama's chief politi-
cal strategist who left the White
House this year to return to Chi-
cago to work on the re-election
and be closer to his Chicago-
based family. "The conversation
in Washington is completely dif-
ferent than the conversation you
hear out here."
Obama's advisers hope a Chi-
cago location could insulate
his campaign from some of the
Washington chatter and news
leaks that often plague cam-

paigns. A beyond-the-Beltway
headquarters could allow them
to offset the notion that Obama,
who campaigned as an outsid-
er above the partisan fray and
promised a new approach to
politics, has become the ultimate
political insider.
"Basing it in Chicago says,
'I'm not of Washington,' but if he
doesn't spend time in Chicago,
he is of Washington," said Paul
Light, a public service professor
at New York University.
Obama's relationship with his
town has evolved over the years.
He was a community organiz-
er, worked on a major voter drive
and practiced law in his early
days in the city.

"We're very pleased that he has

FORT WORTH, Texas
Texas wildfires
spread across state
Firefighters from25 stateswere
battling more than a dozen blazes
across much of West Texas yes-
terday in what state forest service
officials called the single worst
fire day the state has ever seen.
A fast-moving wildfire had
spread to more than 60,000 acres
yesterday in Presidio County
and Jeff Davis County, where it
destroyed about 20 homes in Fort
Davis, about 200 miles southeast
of El Paso. Widespread electric-
ity outages were reported after
numerous power poles burned.
But the blaze that started Sat-

was used as an evacuation shelter,

Cuba blamed for
sunken barge with
supplies for Haiti
A U.S. housing company is
blaming Cuba for the loss of a
barge loaded with supplies to
build shelters for displaced earth-
quake survivors in Haiti.
Executives with Harbor Homes
LLC said late Saturday that the
Cuban government denied the
U.S. Coast Guard permission to
enter its waters to reclaim a drift-
ing barge carrying $2 million
worth of humanitarian supplies
bound for the quake-devastated
Caribbean country.
As a result, the barge carry-
ing cargo to build 1,000 homes
in Haiti sank in December as the
Cuban military attempted to tow
it ashore. A tow line snapped and
the barge ran aground, scattering
building supplies, three tractors,

and a bulldozer into the Atlantic,
company officials said.

Former Egpyt
president denies
abuse of power
In the first remarks since his
dramatic ouster, former President
Hosni Mubarak denied that he
used his position to amass wealth
andpropertyduringthree decades
in power, and issued an emotional
defense of his legacy.
The statement, broadcast yes-
terday at the end of a turbulent
weekend that saw a deadly mili-
tary crackdown on protesters,
only stoked more public anger.
In the prerecorded audiotape,
the 82-year-old Mubarak spoke
with a tone of authority more in
keeping with his past power than
his current situation.
As the ruling military council
comes under increasing public
pressure for its management of
the post-Mubarak transition, the
ex-president's first words were a
reminderthathe still has agrip on
the country's mood.

Tough transition
in Tunisia after
govt. overthrow

With new freedom
comes fear of
political turmoil
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - In the
new Tunisia, a store window in
the capital displays books that
were banned under the former
regime. Protesters shout for jobs
or justice almost daily on tree-
lined streets.
And after half a century of one-
man rule, Tunisians can choose
from more than SO political par-
ties.
Yet the freedom that is intoxi-
cating Tunisia comes with a sense
of fragility, a fear that it could
spin out of control. So helmeted
troops backed by armored vehi-
cles stand guard alongthe central
Avenue Bourguiba in Tunis, and
some buildings are ringed with
barbed wire. Police have sealed
off a plaza where Tunisians held
days-long sit-ins not so long ago,
and have fired tear gas to prevent
new rallies there.

The contradictions playing out
in Tunisia's streets show how this
tiny country's burst of freedom is
marred by a growing anxiety over
the future. With elections coming
up, liberals worry that democ-
racy will bringthe Islamists, per-
haps the best-organized political
movement in post-revolt Tunisia,
to power. Economists fear that
continued turmoil will scare off
investors and tourists.
Activists who helped drive
out dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben
Ali in January are concerned his
die-hard supporters will try to
regroup.
At stake is more than Tunisia
itself. Just as Tunisia's overthrow
of Ben Ali sparked anti-govern-
ment uprisings across the Arab
world, its success - or failure - in
moving toward a stable democra-
cy could once again send a strong
signal to its neighbors.
"Tunisia has particular sym-
bolic value as the first Arab revo-
lution," said Shadi Hamid, an

White House: Obam a
to lay out spending plan

President to reveal
budget cuts during
speech Wednesday
WASHINGTON.(AP) - One
budget deal down, President
Barack Obama and Congress
began to pivot yesterday from
the painful standoff over this
year's spending to a pair of defin-
ing debates over the nation's
borrowing limit and the elec-
tion-year budget.
Much will be revealed at
midweek, when the House and
Senate are expected to vote on a
budget for the remainder of this
fiscal year and Obama reveals
his plan to reduce the deficit, in
part by scaling back programs
for seniors and the poor. Across
the dial yesterday, messen-
gers from both parties framed
the series of spending fights as
debates over cuts - a thematic
victory for House Republicans
swept to power by a populist
mandate for smaller, more aus-
tere government.
"We've had to bring this
president kicking and scream-
ing to the table to cut spending,"
said House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor, R-Va., on "Fox News
Sunday."
Presidential adviser David
Plouffe said Obama has long
been committed to finding ways
for the nation to spend within

its means. He confirmed that
the president would unveil more
specifics for deficit reduction
with a speech Wednesday that
would reveal plans to reduce the
government's chief health pro-
grams for seniors and the poor.
"You're going to have to look
at Medicare and Medicaid and
see what kind of savings you
can get," Obama adviser David
Plouffe said yesterday on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions,
the top Republican on the Sen-
ate Budget Committee, called
Obama's planned speech "an
apparent recognition that the
budget plan he submitted to
Congress ... fails to address our
dire fiscal challenges."
In a press release yesterday,
Sessions said any revision to
the 2012 budget submitted by
Obama in February "must be
presented in a detailed, concrete
form" for scrutiny by the House
and Senate budget committees
and the Congressional Budget
Office.
The presidential speech on
Wednesday is part of official
Washington's shift from the
standoff over spending through
Septemberto next year's budget
and beyond. Alone and togeth-
er, the prospects of raising the
debt ceiling and passing a 2012
spending plan are politically
perilous, a knot that lawmakers
will spend the coming months

trying to unravel. That means
competing plans to shore up the
nation's long-term fiscal health
in a debate many predict will
make Friday's nail-biter look
minor
For all the forward focus yes-
terday, congressional officials
still were analyzing Friday's
348-70 vote to fund the govern-
ment through the week. Operat-
ing under it, aides were putting
to paper the longer-term bipar-
tisan accord to fund the gov-
ernment through September. It
wasn't clear that the vote would
remain the same on the spend-
ing bill for the next six months.
The late hour of Friday's
handshake left lawmakers little
time to react. House members of
both parties who voted for the
funding through the week could
not say yesterday that they'd
vote for the plan to fund the gov-
ernment through September.
Rep. Chris Van Hollen,
D-Md., who voted "yes" Friday
to extend funding this week
while the final compromise was
written, said he was nonethe-
less undecided on whether he'd
vote for the final deal. On ABC's
"This Week," he said he didn't
think the six-month compro-
mise would pass.
On the other side of the aisle,
Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., also a
"yes" vote on Friday, would not
commit to voting for the six-
month deal either.

Global weapons
spending at lowest
rate in last decade

United States tops
list in military
spending last year
STOCKHOLM (AP) - The
world's military spendinggrew by
only 1.3 percent in 2010, thanks to
budget constraints caused by the
global financial crisis, with the
top three arms investors being
the United States, China and Brit-
ain, a think-tank said Monday.
South America was the region
with the largest military spend-
ing growth of 5.8 percent, with
countries such as Brazil seeking
to increase its international influ-
ence, said the Stockholm Interna-
tional Peace Research Institute.
The institution, known as
SIPRI, said global military spend-
ing in 2010 was the lowest since
2001.
It said the United States topped
the list by spending $698 billion
last year, followed by China with
$119 billion and the United King-
domwith $59.6 billion.
SIPRI said the rise in spending
in South America was partly driv-
en by increased staff costs and
internal security threats in some

countries, but that the change
also should be seen in light of the
region's strong economic growth
and relatively limited exposure to
the world financial crisis.
In many other countries, mili-
taryinvestmentgrowthslowedor
decreased as governments dealt
with budget constraints, SIPRI
said.
Arms investment growth in
Asia slowed to 1.4 percent, reach-
ing a total of $317 billion, and
weapons outlays in Europe fell by
2.8 percentto $382 billion in 2010.
China increased its military
expenditures by 3.8 percent in
2010 to $119 billion. That com-
pared to a growth of 15 percent
between 2008 and 2009, and
SIPRI said the Chinese gov-
ernment had linked its smaller
increase in 2010 to the country's
weaker economic performance
the year before.
Spending cuts also were notice-
able in countries with financial
problems such as Greece and the
smaller economies in central and
easternEurope,thethink-tanksaid.
The U.S. arms investment
growth slowed to 2.8 percent in
2010, compared with a growth of
7.7 percent in 2009.

Gulf regions ask Yemen
president to step down

Tens of thousands
of protesters march
in capital
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - A
regional bloc of oil-rich Arab
nations along the Gulf, includ-
ing powerful Saudi Arabia,
called on Yemen's president
yesterday to step down as part
of a deal with the protest move-
ment demanding for his ouster
after 32 years.
Keeping up the pressure,
tens of thousands of protest-
ers complaining of poverty
and corruption marched in the
capital, Sanaa, yesterday, a day
after renewed clashes between
demonstrators and security
forces there. Witnesses said
police fired a barrage of tear
gas late Saturday and that many
demonstrators suffered breath-
ing problems.
The statement, by foreign
ministers of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council meeting
in the Saudi capital, called on
President Ali Abdullah Saleh
transfer his powers to his vice
president in return for prom-
ises that neither he nor his fam-
ily would be prosecuted for any
crimes committed under his
leadership.
That falls short of protesters'
demands, which include seeing
Saleh face justice. And Saleh
himself has so far refused to
immediately step down, saying
he wants to first be certain the
country is in "safe hands," sug-
gesting the already fragile and

impoverished country could
fall into serious tumult without
him.
"The transfer of power ought
to be in an easy and peaceful
manner that would avoid slid-
ing into chaos and violence, and
as part of a national consensus,"
said a final statement from the
Gulf council.
The embattled president,
once a key U.S. ally in the war
against the al-Qaida terror
network, has tried to cling to
power despite two months of
near-daily protests calling for
his resignation.
Last week, he rejected an
earlier mediation offer by the
Gulf Cooperation Council, say-
ing the group was meddling in
Yemen's affairs. The council
had invited Saleh and Yemen's
opposition groups to Saudi Ara-
bia for talks on its proposal,
similar to the one it endorsed
yesterday.
A diplomat at the Riyadh
meeting said the bloc repeated
an offer to mediate between
Saleh and his opponents. He
requested anonymity because
of the matter's sensitivity.
"All parties must commit to
ending all forms of revenge, pur-
suit and prosecution through
guarantees to that effect," the
statement said.
The statement also called
for the formation of a national
unitygovernment headed bythe
opposition to steer the country
through a transitional period.
Protesters in Sanaa
expressed reservations about

the plan, saying Saleh was buy-
ing time, and refusingto absolve
him from prosecution.
"This is not new. We had
accepted the Gulf offer before
on condition that Saleh step
down, along with all his family
members and sons who are in
power," said Wassim al-Qarshi,
an organizer of the Sanaa pro-
test. He said the protesters want
a transitional presidential coun-
cil to prepare the country for
elections and a new constitu-
tion.
The protesters called for
nationwide protests Mon-
day, and the Interior Ministry
warned against taking to the
streets in violation of the law
that requires protests to be
authorized.
On Saturday, a senior adviser
to Saleh met in Riyadh with the
Saudi foreign minister, a sign
that negotiations are continu-
ing.
The Gulf council consists of
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait
and Bahrain.
In rejecting the initial media-
tion offer, Saleh appeared to
have been particularly ruffled
by a comment by Qatar's prime
minister last week that "we
hope to reach an agreement
that includes the resignation" of
Saleh.
Saleh has offered to step
down at the end of this year
if an acceptable transfer of
power is reached, but the
opposition fears he is just stall-
ing for time.

Crisis (barely) averted
Congress needs to start compromising
The Smithsonian Institution, National Zoo and national parks
across the country remained open for business Saturday
morning, but this was aliost not the case. Late Friday night,
Congress finally reached a compromise that prevented a federal gov-
ernment shutdown. But Americans should not thank Congress for
finally doing in the eleventh hour what it should have done days, if
not months, ago. While we appreciate Congress getting its act togeth-
er, it should have done so before 11 p.m. on Friday night. This goes to
show how unbearable the partisan politics of Washington D.C. have
become. The partisan divide is tearing apart the nation and making it
impossible to govern efficiently. Congress, please stop playing games,
and go back to doing your job.

Friday night, as a government shutdown
loomed near, House Speaker John Boehner
(R-Ohio), Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid (D-Nev.) and President Barack Obama
finally struck a deal. The compromise that
was reached cut $38 billion in governmental
spending.Accordingto anApril10 Bloomberg
article, Democrats were initially sticking to
$33 billion in cuts, but on Friday afternoon,
Obama raised this number and agreedto $38
billion. Republicans were asking for more
than $40 billion, and the lingering issue was
the Planned Parenthood funding ban. Obama
and the Democrats refused to cut any spend-
ing from family planning services. The long-
term Republican budget plan proposes $4
trillion in cuts and will be the issue of debate
in the upcoming weeks.
The good news is that the U.S. finally has
a budget - in the short term at least. The bad
news is that the country was one-and-a-half
hours away from a total shutdown. This is
unacceptable. At 10:30 p.m. Congress still
hadn't reached a consensus, and Americans
across the nation were uncertain if their
paychecks, tax returns and pension ben-
efits would be delayed. Congress works for
and represents the people: It does not exist
to increase their burdens. There's no reason

that this compromise had to come so late.
Congress should have and could have acted
earlier.
Much of the resistance came as a result of
the Tea Party's influence. While it is under-
standable that the Tea Party is obligated to
fight for the policies it was elected on, it is
unreasonable for members to do so without
compromise. The Republican Party is being
pushed further to the political Right by the
Tea Party, and this is affecting its ability to
negotiate and compromise. The Tea Party
needs to understand the limits on its man-
date and should stop asking for irrational
one-sided policies. Republicans need to take
a much stronger stance against this extreme
movement and reclaim their authority.
Most importantly, the budget ordeal
revealed how ugly partisan politics on Capi-
tol Hill have become. Americans are already
frustrated with the petty party battles being
fought in Washington D.C., and this budget
crisis did nothing to ease these frustrations.
Instead of showing leadership when it was
most necessary, our representatives in Wash-
ington were busy disagreeing over personal
agendas. Congress needs to get its act togeth-
er to have deliberative discussions and nego-
tiate policy compromises.

that much could possibly listen
enough. So, I guess it's good that
this is my last column. After this I
can finally shut up and listen.
I began as a freshman at the Uni-
versity in the fall of 2004. In my
seven years as a student here, I wit-
nessed the nationwide expansion of
Facebook, release of YouTube and
Gmail, the launch of Android and
the iPhone and the explosion of blog-
ging and texting.
In terms of expanding the voice of
humanity to encompass more fully
the everyday, average person, these
have been perhaps the most eventful
seven years in history. Time maga-
zine (somewhat belatedly) recog-
nized the momentous shift that had
begun in naming "You" the Person
of the Year for 2006: Everyone can
now have a say; the field is more level
than it has ever been in history.
And we certainly have taken
advantage of this information revo-
lution. Count how many friends you
have that tweet, blog or vlog (video
blog, for you social technology phi-
listines). If that number is anything
greater than zero, then congratula-
tions: You have powerful friends

who can and have changed social
and political discourse by speaking
what theysee and hear about in plat-
forms that enable immediate world-
wide dissemination.
In the time I've been writing 750-
word columns for this page, count-
less people have made their voices
heard globally in tweets and blog
posts just a few words long. The
beauty of this, the ultimate infor-
mation age, is that we need not even
write a word to direct countless
national and international conver-
sations - a photo on Flickr show-
ing Michael Phelps with a bong or
a video on YouTube catching Sen-
ate candidate George Allen using a
racial slur are definitely worth more
than all my 330,000 words.
As I write now from this offi-
cial platform for the last time, I am
pleased to underscore that one does
not need to have a newspaper col-
umn to be heard. However, I'd like
to point out that listening is a very
important second component of infi-
nite information dissemination in
this amazing new world that goes
easily ignored. We are all better able
to propagate our own opinions, but
what good is that if no one chooses
to listen to what is being said?
We are all focused on getting
our own voices out there. Campus
activist groups, and indeed political
groups across the country, feel the
need to take a stand on every issue
and then let their voice be heard.
Such political speech is their eternal
right, and it has recently become a
right easily exercised via the Inter-
net. And random individuals, sud-
denly finding it so easy to blog or
tweet, also feel the need to speak out
(UCLA student Alexandra Wallace,
for example). All of us can and do

egins
speak more these days, but the trag-
edy is thatthere just isn't enough lis-
teninggoingon.
As a columnist for so many years,
I suppose I am guilty of speak-
ing too much and not listening
enough. I learned the hard way
that one need not always have an
opinion and be outspoken about
it: It is sometimes better to listen,
understand and move on without
an uttered word. In a culture that
prizes opinionated rants as brave
spurts of the democratic ideal, it is
important to point out that recent-
ly, we've all been doing a little too
much talking. There simply has not
been enough listening, thinking
and reflecting.
My speaking stint
on this page has
come to an end.
With these last words, my speak-
ing stint on this page finally comes
to an end, and I move happily into
the other, equally important stage
of intelligent discourse: listening.
Much will be said about issues I
think I understand on this page and
the hundreds of others like it across
America. Like all of you, Iwill listen,
question, support and act.
But just in case I get antsy, I did
sign up for a Twitter account the
other day. It's the next big thing, I
hear.

SETH SODERBORG I
Republicans don't want to govern

Chen is deeply misinformed
on the subject of religion
TO THE DAILY:
I was deeply disturbed and offended by the
methods and language used by Dar-Wei Chen
in his article last week (Religion is becoming
extinct, 04/05/2011). He obviously is gravely
misinformed on the subject of religion, only
taking the negative bits and pieces highlighted
by today's media. I was so distraught that I
wasn't sure where to begin, so I will just jump
right in.
First off, stories in the beginning of the Old
Testament, such as the creation story, Noah's
Ark and Jonah and the Whale, serve to teach
us about faith and love and devotion to God.
The Catholic Church doesn't hold these sto-
ries to be historical fact. However, every-
thing in the Bible is to be taken seriously,
whether as historical fact (Israelite history
in the Old Testament and Christian history in
the New Testament), allegory (Creation), or
symbolism (Noah's Ark). All of the Bible has
something to offer. And most of the history
in the Bible is evidenced in texts and histori-
cal records of other societies. So to say that
new religions like Scientology are as wacky
as Christianity, which has a 2,000-year-old
history and 4,000 years of foundation before
that, is completely ignorant.
I also take offense to Chen's claim that reli-
gion hasn't been good for the world. There are
countless churches, synagogues, mosques and
religious centers around the world that do an
immeasurable number of good deeds - not to
mention all the homeless shelters, charities
and volunteer organizations around the world
with religious roots and backing. There are
many examples of this at several places of wor-
ship around campus. That's not to say religion

hasn't been used as an excuse for violence. It
most certainly has since the beginning of time,
but to base one's view of a group on the actions
of a few radicals is incredibly unfair and irra-
tional. The bottom line is religious groups are
run by humans, and humans are inherently
imperfect and bound to make mistakes. But
religion is always there to set us straight. I
agree that mankind can be secularly charita-
ble, but it's a bold statement to say that we can
do charitable works from the goodness of our
own hearts and not because of a higher power.
That's an ideal secular world that's practi-
cally impossible. If there's no higher power
to answer to, what's the point of being a good
person? Why wouldn't you do everything for
your own benefit and to pleasure your own life
as much as possible?
As a devout and practicing Catholic, I'm not
100 percent certain that my God is the right
one. I will even admit that my church hasn't
been anywhere close to perfect throughout
history. But I will also say that the Catholic
Church is a leader in the promotion of social
justice and human dignity (just read the papal
encyclicals Gaudium et Spes and Humanae
Vitae). I would argue that religion is needed
now more than ever to keep us in check in
light of advancement of technology. We need
to be careful where we tread our feet so that
we don't start losing respect for ourselves and
each other.
I can honestly say that instances where I
have done "works of God" have been some of
the most satisfying times in my life, from a
mission trip to Juarez, Mexico to the annu-
al Thanksgiving drive back home in New
Orleans. And as long as I'm here, I will say
with confidence that my religion won't be
going extinct anytime soon.

Aren't we a lucky bunch? We just missed the chance
to find out what it's like to live without a government.
The federal government nearly closed last week. A zero-
hour deal between President Barack Obama and House
Republicans spared the country the sight of a shuttered
Capitol, closed national parks and an end to trash pick-
up in the District of Columbia. How did things get to
this point?
House Republicans seem to be refusing to govern.
It's the House's responsibility to draft budgetary leg-
islation. Since Republicans took over at the beginning
of this year, they've drafted outlandish budgets that
cut programs like the Nutrition Assistance Program
for Women, Infants and Children while reducing taxes
on the rich. Obama has made it clear that he wouldn't
accept cuts that imposed harsh burdens on the needi-
est Americans. Democrats in the Senate said "no" to
this Republican budget. Rejection should have forced
Republicans to make a more moderate proposalThis is
how divided government normally works.
After the proposed budget returned to the-House,
a group of ideologues - mostly freshmen lawmakers
elected on a Tea Party platform - hijacked the process.
They demanded that the proposed budget cuts be dou-
bled - even though Senate Democrats had made it clear
that they would not accept the original cuts.
When the budget doesn't pass before the fiscal year
has begun, the government shuts down. This happened
for a few hours in Michigan in 2007. It also happened in
1995, when former President Bill Clinton vetoed a bud-
get approved by a newly-Republican Congress. Today's
Republican leaders knew that the last government shut-
down hurt their party, and they didn't want one to hap-
pen again. So, for months, they have kept the federal
government going by passing "continuing resolutions"
that fund the government for a few weeks at a time. The
last resolution expired on Friday.
This time, lawmakers barely reached a deal to con-
tinue funding the government. Democrats offered last
week to cut $33 billion out of the budget - an amount of
money equal to what House Speaker John Boehner (R-
Ohio) first said he wanted to cut. Because the budget has
been so delayed, cutting $33 billion is actually cutting

six month of spending. Cutting $1 from the budget in
April 2011 has the same impact on government services
as cutting $2 in October 2010 would have had over the
course of the full fiscal year.
The final deal cut $38 billion. This is the largest dis-
cretionary spending reduction in U.S. history. Getting a
budget passed was an accomplishment, but it shouldn't
have happened like this. Instead of a rational debate
with all options on the table, Republicans proposed
purely partisan cuts knowing that Democrats would
refuse to budge on most of them.
The lion's share of the deficit comes from obligations
like Social Security and Medicare, which must be fully
funded each year. Most of the budget fighting has been
about smaller programs that the government can choose
to fund from year to year. A better Republican leader-
ship would work with Democrats to solve the problems
caused by long-term obligations. Choosing to fight so
bitterly over six months of spending makes it impossible
for lawmakers to address greater structural costs. The
last serious attempt to restructure one of these major
expenses was the health care bill, which Republicans
opposed as if their congressional seats depended on
campaign contributions from insurance companies.
When a company spends more than it has, it looks for
ways to make more money. It also cuts costs. Income
taxes today are as low as they have been in decades. We
saw economic growth under Clinton, when taxes were
higher, just as we saw economic growth under almost
every president before former President George W.
Bush who cut taxes dramatically. Today's Republicans
aren't fiscally responsible, they're just anti-tax. Former
Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both
chose to raise taxes to pay for their spending. In that
respect, they understood fiscal responsibility far better
than their successors.
If the Republicans were serious about fixing spend-
ing, they would consider tax raises. They would try to
reform Social Security. They would have supported
health care reform. Instead, they're fighting tooth and
nail to protect the rich and abandon the poor.

said the Socialist Equality Par-
ty's primary motive is to take
action against "big business par-
ties."
Joseph Kirshore, the national
secretary of the SEP, opened the
event by discussing the economic
state of the nation. He used the
state of California as an example,
noting that the net wealth of the
19 wealthiest Californians is $19
billion, while the state faces a
debt of $26.8 billion.
O Kirshore added that one in
four children in the United States
lives in poverty and the SEP is a
voice for those children and also
a "voice for the working class."
He then detailed a series of
resolutions to be voted on the fol-
lowing day, centering on topics
such as the working class, young
people and defending democratic
rights. After Kirshore spoke,
audience members had the
opportunity to make statements
in support or against the various
resolutions.

"There isn't any research

more important for attendees to
focus on solutions for the most
pressing problems for public
transportation. These include
public safety, improving home-

unpredictable oil prices and
declining transportation fund-
ing.
"It's an exciting and challeng-

ment. Those who presented also
expressed their concerns about
the Democratic Party and the
current administration.
Speaking on behalf of the
party, Kirshore said Obama
"emerged as the candidate of
change" but has not improved
the country since former Presi-
dent G.W. Bush's administration.
From expansion of tax cuts, to
three wars, to ignoring the mid-
dle class as a whole, it is more of
the same," he said.
LSA senior Larissa Benjamin,
"Having the actual experience
where my friend passed away
really enhanced my feeling of
need to this organization," Eis-
man said. "That's why I relay."
Stories similar to Eisman's
were told throughout the field
and were exemplified through
Luminaria, a tradition that
occurs at Relay for Life events
across the country. The night-
time ceremony features paper
bags that line the track in com-
memoration of cancer victims.
LSA sophomore Sam Lewis
said he has participated in the
rather than intravenously like
chemotherapy treatments, Wang
said. While the research team has
come a longway, it has faced chal-
lenges to get to this point, he said.
"With this type of project there
are many, many hurdles to over-
come before you can get to clini-
cal trials," Wang said.
Wang and his colleagues start-
ed formulating the second com-
pound in the summer of 2004. He
said these types of studies usually
take a long time to develop before
being cleared for human clinical
trials, which he anticipates will
happen for the compound by early
next year.
"One thing about drug devel-
opment is that it is a very lengthy
and costly process," Wang said.
While the drug compound
may prove effective in treating
several different cancers, Wang
Based Insurance Design at the
School of Public Health, said she
learned more about the transit
issues in Southeast Michigan at
the conference.
"For me, it's a great chance to
apply what I know from working
in other areas to find out how I
can better help or get engaged
here in Southeast Michigan,"
Swinburn said.
Public Health student Jeri
Stroupe facilitated a panel dis-
cussion on transportation and
public health during the con-
ference along with LSA junior
Mark Bradley, who works at
the University's Transport
Research Institute. Stroupe
said she wanted to get involved
with the conference because she
saw an opportunity to combine
sustainable transportation and
public health to promote health-
ier lifestyles.
"This is just a great way to get
dialogue and discussion going
and having people from differ-
ent disciplines get on the same
page," she said. "There's stuff
here about CO2 emissions and
efficient energy all the way to
social equity issues related to
transportation, so it's a really

broad scope, and it's increas-
ingly important to have people
from these different fields talk-
ing to each other."
Stroupe said the conference
was an opportunity for students
and professionals to discuss
transportation solutions perti-
nent to the region.
"I think it's really significant
that they're hosting this confer-
ence here in Detroit," she said.
"I think it's just asking for revi-
talization, and I think transpor-

president of the University's
chapter of Students for Social
Equality, said she thinks if more
people understood the party's
stances on issues, they would be
more inclined to identify with
the group and its movement.
SEP Chair David North said
in his closing remarks that the
party doesn't support either the
Democratic or Republican par-
ties, calling them "hostile to the
advancements of social equality
and human rights."
In an interview following
event for seven years. This year,
Lewis served as a team recruit-
ment co-chair.
"The purpose is to fundraise
for cancer research, for advocacy
efforts, for education and aware-
ness," Lewis said.
The team that raised the
most was the University's Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity, raising
more than $33,000, according to
the Relay for Life website. The
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Alpha
Epsilon Pi team raised the sec-
ond highest amount of donations
- with a total sum of almost
said treatment results could vary
depending on the type of cancer
beingtreated.
Tests of the drug compound
conducted on mice show the
compounds have promising
tumor-shrinking abilities with
few side effects, according to an
April 6 University press release.
The drug compound works by
activating a protein that kills
cancer cells.
Nicole Fawcett, a spokeswom-
an for the University's Compre-
hensive Cancer Center, said most
drugs available currently target
only specific types of cancer. The
drug developed by researchers at
the center is unusual as it involves
treating a broad range of cancers,
she said.
The newly discovered treat-
ment will likely be replicable in
human cases, Wangsaid.
tation is one of the most critical
drivers of that."
Minetta Van Strien, a gradu-
ate student in the School of
Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment, said she enjoyed the
collaborative nature of the
conference and the exchange
of ideas between scholars and
professionals, adding that the
discussions were relevant to her
education.
"It directly relates to my stud-
ies because I am interested in
transportation but also sustain-
ability." she said. "I think there

the conference, Kirshore said it
is important the Social Equity
Party continues to take an active
stance on political issues.
"This is a society that is domi-
nated by a tiny layer of the popu-
lation: the Democrats and the
Republicans. The experience of
the Obama administration has
demonstrated that the Demo-
cratic Party is no less represen-
tative of the working class than
the Republican Party," Kirshore
said. "Members of the working
class are being driven down."
$18,900. There were 182 teams,
comprising 3,246 people, partici-
pating in this year's event.
As people ran and walked
around the track, entertainment
was also provided on the field,
including a show by the Univer-
sity comedy troupe ComCo and
another by Michigan football
players.
Michigan State Universitywill
have its Relay for Life event this
weekend. As of Sunday afternoon
the university had 91 registered
teams and raised more than
$84,000.
According to the study, the
compound displays the abil-
ity to eradicate entire tumors.
Additionally, unlike many cur-
rent drug therapies on the mar-
ket, including chemotherapy,
the compound caused little to no
harm to the mice.
The researchers have also
identified markers in tumors
that indicate which sites the
compound will be most effective
in treating. These markers will
help physicians determine which
patients would benefit most from
the treatment, according to the
press release.
While no human trials of the
drug compounds are underway,
University researchers are work-
ing with Ascenta Therapeutics
to further test the compounds
before human clinical trials can
begin.
will be a lot of things that I can
use for my masters project here
and even the papers I have due
next week."
Rackham student Khawar
Abbas Khan, who is also study-
ing in the SNRE, said the confer-
ence allowed him to increase his
knowledge of the transportation
industry.
"This conference has been
really good for me because,
before this, I didn't have any
idea about how to make trans-
portation more sustainable,"
Khan said.

FLOREK
From Page 1A
the players on the ice - the only
time he had done it this year. He
clapped and tried comforting
senior goalie Shawn Hunwick.
Hunwick skated expressionless
to the bench.
Hunwick had trouble keep-
ing it together during the press
conference. Senior forward Carl
Hagelin had glossy eyes before
he took the podium, and senior
forward Louie Caporusso was
robotic.
It was the pain of being so
close.
But the fact they got this far,
the extraordinary circumstanc-
es that allowed Michigan to
experience this agony, was lost
in the shuffle of bleach-blonde-
haired men hugging and crying.
When exactly did you believe
this team was going to win the
National Championship?
When Hagelin's shot with
a minute left on senior night
bounced off a defenseman and
slid between Jerry Kuhn's legs,
it was lucky. When he put it off
the post and in during the final
seconds of overtime, something
special was going on. When the
refs upheld sophomore Kevin
Lynch's goal against Nebraska-
Omaha, it was justification.
When Boston College lost
in the first round of the West
Regional it was divine inter-
vention. And when Hunwick
performed two miracles against
North Dakota, officially qualify-
ing him for sainthood, God was
officially on Michigan's side.
Nowhere along the way was
there a sense that this was the
best team in the country. But
they were going to win it.
"If you look when we were
sitting in Miami, I don't think
anybody thought we were going
to go play for the National
Championship," Hunwick said.
They caught the magic that
all teams need to go deep in the
tournament. And two hours
before game time, a throng of
Michigan fans lined the players'

Monday, April 11, 2011 - 5A
entrance, going four rows deep
on either side. On the outskirts
was senior forward Scooter
Vaughan's mom.
"We have to sit in the same
order," she told those around
her. "We can't mess with the
mojo."
The year had become one
long series of superstitions. The
underachievers all of the sudden
overachieved. Don't mess with
what's working. You stick with
the same lineup for every NCAA
Tournament game, even if that
means sitting a second-round
NHL draft pick. You sit in the
same order. You dance to "Can't
Turn You Loose" during the sec-
ond intermission.
You don't tempt fate.
This was a talented group
of players who bought into the
team aspect and rode the mojo
to the finals. It wasn't the best
team in the tournament, but, as
Berenson said after the North
Dakota game:
"The best team doesn't always
win."
Saturday, the lineup was set,
the seating arrangement was the
same, the dancing had finished.
It was a tied game, but Michigan
was going to win. The rituals
had been performed.
Then a scrum along the
boards turned into a man
streaking down the middle,
uncovered. One-timer. Game
Over. Emptiness.
And more than an hour later,
after the seven seniors had
peeled off their jersey for the
last time, the emptiness was still
there. The team filed out to its
bus, carrying nothing - there is
no consolation trophy. Eventual-
ly they'll see the season for what
it is: one that saw a team inex-
plicably find a way to go further
than it technically should have.
But not now. Not when liter-
ally 20 feet to their left, mem-
bers of Minnesota-Duluth posed
with the National Championship
trophy in the hallway.
So close after coming so far.

Study reveals positive media
reporting leads to good deeds

Man reports
being stabbed
amid altercation

People more likely
to donate money
after reading about
acts of kindess
By BRANDON SHAW
Daily StaffReporter
Some people are spurred to do
charitable acts after the onset of
an illness or another traumatic
event in their lives, but new
research shows that individu-
als may be inclined to donate
more money after reading about
extraordinary good deeds of oth-
ers.
Two years ago, Brent McFer-
ran, an assistant professor of
marketing in the Ross School
of Business, and Karl Aquino, a
business professor at the Uni-
versity of British Columbia, set
out to test their hypothesis that
news stories that feature excep-
tional acts of virtue inspire
people to donate to charity and
do good deeds themselves, com-

pared to stories about positive
interaction.
The study, which involved
abouto800 participants, was pub-
lished last week in the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychol-
ogy. In the study, subjects were
randomly given a newspaper
article. Half the participants read
a story about a couple watching a
sunset - representative of posi-
tive, optimistic news reporting
and good experiences. The other
participants read a story that
described a 2006 shooting at an
Amish school, where the shooter
killed several children and then
himself. Parents of the victims
forgave the shooter and offered
money to his widowed wife.
After reading the news sto-
ries, participants completed
a survey in which they were
asked to divide a hypothetical
$10 between themselves and an
unknown person. This aspect of
the study sought to test wheth-
er people were more willing to
donate to charity based on the
reception of pleasant news or to
acts of kindness amid difficult

times.
The results revealed that
participants who read the story
about the victims forgiving the
shooter gave 32 percent more
money to the unknown individ-
ual.
The results suggest that the
tone of news stories may have a
more powerful effect on readers
than previously believed, McFer-
ran said.
"Media reports could poten-
tially play a crucial role in the
mobilization of history makers if
less attention was paid to nega-
tive coverage," McFerran said.
McFerran, who called this the
"look in the mirror effect," point-
ed to news stories about suicide,
homicide and other traumatic
events and said the study was
conducted to show that this type
of reporting is done in excess,
with far too little attention being
paid to positivity in the world.
McFerran. and Aquino con-
cluded that people were more
inclined to donate money after
reading stories about extraor-
dinary acts of kindness in the

news, rather than pleasant inci-
dents like a sunset.
Aquino wrote in an e-mail
interview that what he found
most interesting about the study
was "how simply exposing peo-
ple to stories and examples of
extraordinaryvirtue actually led
to changes in behavior."
He added that not only does
this exposure alter people's
actions, but it also "seems to
change how people view human-
ity so that it is more positive."
According to Aquino, the
news stories in the study caused
people to think about their own
lives and howthey might become
better people. He noted that the
study doesn't indicate the lon-
gevity of these effects, though he
said he hopes to explore them in
the future.
"Terrible situations certainly
bring light to certain causes, but
a positive story could shed pos-
sibly better light into various
charitable causes," McFerran
said. " ... We hope this research
causes more positive reporting
in the future."

Ann Arbor Police
investigating
incident at 700
block of Monroe St.
By NICOLE ABER
ManagingNews Editor
A man reported to the Ann
Arbor Police Department that
he was stabbed by another man
while the two were having
an altercation early yesterday
morning, according to a Uni-
versity Department of Public
Safety crime alert.
According to the AAPD, the
man's injuries were not life

threatening.
The incident occurred at
about 1:25 a.m. yesterday morn-
ing on the 700 block of Monroe
Street, the crime alert states.
The alert was sent at about 5
a.m. today.
The suspect fled the scene
going southbound on South
State Street in a vehicle and
was dressed in a blue and white
jacket, according to the crime
alert.
AAPD said it could not com-
ment on the incident because
police are still following up on
leads as of midnight last night.

In remembrance of Lumet

The man behind '12 Angry Men' and
'Network' passed away last weekend
By Imran Syed I Daily Arts Writer

Sidney Lumet's films never
sat right. That's probably why he
never won an Academy Award,
but the world is richer for it. Like
those great artists whose signifi-
cance wasn't fully appreciated
until after their death, Lumet,
who passed away Saturday at the
age of 86, leaves behind a deep,
rich legacy that will resonate for
decades.
Be it classics like "Dog Day
Afternoon" and "Network" or
lesser-known works like "The
Pawnbroker" and the recent
"Before the Devil Knows You're
Dead," Lumet seemingly took
pride in rough edges, spiraling
conflicts and imprecise out-
comes. Few, if any, of his films
felt smooth and complete. A
master artist content to leave
undone those parts of his story
that real life would leave empty
as well, Lumet created a dis-
comfiting brand of drama that
allowed even his fictional works
to resonate as reality.
Three profound cases in point
are "12 Angry Men," "Network"
and "The Verdict." All three may
appear at times contrived and
far-fetched to the casual viewer,
but they were epically prescient.
Practitioners in the legal, jour-
nalism and medical profes-
sions routinely cite those three
films (respectively) as veritably
incisive and influential: U.S.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia
Sotomayor has spoken of being
inspired by "12 Angry Men," and
there's hardly a news anchor or
commentator in America who
hasn't seen and doesn't con-
stantly quote "Network."
Along with Robert Altman,
Lumet was perhaps the greatest
American director to never win
an Academy Award (though he
was awarded an Honorary Oscar
in 2006). Even aside from that, a
comparison to great contempo-
raries like Martin Scorsese, Ste-
ven Spielberg or Woody Allen is
simply going to be off the mark
because Lumet never tried or
wanted to make films that way.
While Spielberg poured hun-
dreds of millions into CGI pro-
ductions and Scorsese and Allen
rehashed their tried-and-true
formulas a million times over,
Lumet was constantly on the
search for new conflicts and sto-
ries to understand, weave and
convey. The result wasn't always
perfect - indeed, there were
several downright bad films -
but it was always a fresh product
and an ambitious production.
While he became known
for his love for the courtroom
drama, no two of Lumet's mov-
ies are even remotely similar in
execution. Thematically, they
may all share his fascination
with human fallacy and hypoc-

risy, but never did Lumet tell
the same story twice. Wheth-
er working from a screenplay
based on real events ("Serpico")
or classic fiction ("Murder on
the Orient Express"), Lumet
brought energy, inspiration and
a willingness to try something
new.
At 83, he made his final film,
released in 2007. In many ways,
"Before the Devil Knows You're
Dead" was also his most com-
plicated film - juggling mul-
tiple viewpoints and timelines
to tell a sickening story of fam-
ily conflict. It was Lumet at his
finest, not only for the themes

explored, but also because he
had found a new challenge and
executed it perfectly, at an age
when most would be content to
sit back and reminisce upon a
remarkable career.
Having left behind at least five
or six films that will be consid-
ered true classics, and a sizable
lifetime canon that speaks to
his commitment to the captur-
ing the changing face of reality,
even in fiction, Lumet's place
among the greatest of all time
is unquestionable. Just watch
"Night Falls on Manhattan" or
"Prince of the City." I'm sure you
will agree.

Disengaging from start to fin-

acting, an unearthly assault of
masturbation gags (that's so

more animated than his mor-

Franco's omnipresent sheepish
grin and forced British accent
convey a strained performance
(that, or being supremely elevat-

Equally disappointing is the

underuse of Deschanel, whose
minimal screen time is a disser-

while Portman does not tank, it is
unfortunate that the regal star-
let would pirouette into a campy
medieval flick. Though their
every film need not be an awards

promising upstarts like Franco
and Portman to more wisely
choose their roles - preferably
not the lowbrow scraps that are
best left unproduced.
Instead it is McBride - whose

_________________________________________________ ARTIST INTERVIEW
INNOVATION IN ANN ARBOR IS "
K.R.I.T. critical on
- life and his success

ERIN.KIRKLAND/Daily
Darshan Karwat spoke about his attempt to live with little personal waste at the TEDxUofM conference on Friday.
TEDx inspires crazy

Idea-sharing
conference finds its
Ann Arbor audience
ByJULIA
SMITH-EPPSTEINER
DailyArts Writer
"Who here is skipping class or
work to be here?" asked TEDx-
UofM openingspeaker and Public
Policy junior Alex O'Dell. Hands
of all ages shot into the highly
charged air of the Michigan The-
ater. All 21 speakers, dispersed
throughout a rainy April 8, were
affiliated with the University and
were enthusiastic in sharing their
wild ideas with an exceedingly
welcoming audience.
TED is a nonprofit organiza-
tion formed in 1984 as a confer-
ence aimed to bring together
people who have ideas worth
spreading from the worlds of
technology, entertainment and
design. This is the second year
an independently organized
TED event has taken place on
the University's campus. The
first year's theme was "Do You
Realize" and- this time a And,
"Encouraging Crazy Ideas" set
the tone for the conference.
All 1,700 attendees who made
it to their red plush seats had
filled out a short application not-
ing a crazy idea of theirs in six
words. My smartest peers sur-
rounded me, all there to engage
and be provoked to do. The the-
aiefwas dud-less.
"Session one was focused on
"Exploration & Discovery." It
was serious and seriously inspi-
rational. Neurosurgeon and 'U'
professor Parag G. Patil started
the morning off by discussing
the power to bridge the com-
munication gap for people with
Parkinson's through deep brain
stimulation. This straightfor-
ward, well-dressed man got
the crowd sitting forward in
their seats when he introduced
the idea of "self-talk," the voice
we're always hearing in our head
that we too easily accept as our
gut feeling. I jerked my head in

agreement at Patil's proposal
that bettering understanding
our self-talk is the key to bet-
tering communication between
the two dimensions of the mind,
intuition and analysis.
Mawuli Gyakobo, a doctor
from Ghana and a scholar of the
African Presidential Scholars
Program, filled the room with
guilt as he discussed the gap in
quality of medical care in third-
world countries. This developed
into his dream of more people
joining him to be "the voice of
the dying." Social entrepreneur
Kathleen Sienko tagged on to
Gyakobo's somber reality check
with an explanation of her medi-
cal research in India, selling her
idea establishing sustainable,
mutually beneficial relation-
ships in the field of health care.
A lunch break refueled
inspired cells. Those who hadn't
bought the lunch-packaged tick-
et were encouraged to indulge in
local Indian cuisine at Suvai or
organic pizza at Silvio's, helping
out small businesses that spon-
sored the TEDx event. I selfishly
opted for Earthen Jar - a deli-
cious vegan buffet with no lines.
Upon return, I noticed a TV
screen in the lobby on which
excited Twitter posts about the
event appeared in rapid fire.
Once the theater had its buzz
back, the second session became
even more relatable to college
students when Jameson Toole,
who graduated from the Univer-
sity and is now a Ph.D. in MIT's
Engineering Systems Division,
showed a slide with a digitalized
image of his relationship with
his girlfriend - the frequencies
of their emails, texts, Facebook
communication and instant mes-
sages expressing their transi-
tion from friendship to romance
through data. His idea of using
now to change tomorrow was
embodied when he quoted a
speaker from a former TED talk,
Hans Rosling - "Let my dataset
change your mindset." All I can
say is, I wouldn't want to be that
girlfriend.
Session two of the event was
titled "Invention" and rolled

blithely on to Rackham Ph.D.
Darshan Karwat's story of his
project of not producing any
personal waste. Walking out on
to the decorative stage, he car-
ried two trash bags full of the
only trash he had dispensed
in the past 376 days. Karwat
admitted that toilet waste and
soap use cannot be avoided, but
he concluded with an inspiring
statement about finding beauty
in making simple choices and
trying to subside our compulsion
for the new and the next. As I
trash a Coca-Cola can and move
on to check Facebook, I would
say he imparts some wise ideas
well worth adopting.
SAC senior Jacob Mendel
showed his intriguing black-
and-white 3-D film "Train of
Shadows," allowing the attend-
ees to wear shades inside the
theater, the impressive surre-
alist film noir sinking into the
perceptions of many. The length
of the "short" film cut away a
bit of the magic and caused it
to teeter toward confusion, yet
everyone's eyes were glazed
over with imagination. I felt like
we were the kids (and adults) of
the future.
Donia Jarrar, a Masters stu-
dent in musical composition
who was forced to flee Kuwait
at a young age, let the thou-
sand listeners in on her emo-
tional tale of aiding the recent
Egyptian revolution. Jarrar
founded a blog, Speak-to-Tweet,
in which she translated voice-
mails from Egyptians who were
being repressed and left with no
communication because of the
policies of dictator Hosni Mum-
barak.
Three violinists and one cel-
list sweetly closed the event
with an acoustic version of "Do
You Realize??" by The Flaming
Lips. The song's name is not just
the title from the first Universi-
ty's TED event, but is a question
that evokes action, too.
Another admirable speaker,
Chris Van Allsburg, made a
statement that resonated with
me above all others: "The pos-
sessor of the crazy idea does not

By CASSIE BALFOUR
DailyArts Writer
Like most rappers, Big K.R.I.T.
surrounds himself with the typi-
cal entourage. But as his large
posse emerged from a nonde-
script white conversion van, it
was obvious this isn't the ride of a
big pimpin' rap star. The humble
van seems fitting for a talented
poet putting introspective prose
to a dope beat.
Mississippi rapper BigK.R.I.T.
performed last night at the
Blind Pig, building excitement
by jumping into the crowd dur-
ing his hit song "Country Shit."
Known for his southern swagger
and extra crispy flow, .R.L.T.
cites Scarface, UGK and Oukast
among his influences, as well as
the politicallyconsciousgrandfa-
ther of funk, Curtis Mayfield. Big
K.R.I.T. hasn't cracked the Top
40 yet, but he's been hailed as a
young talent in the underground
rap scene, and his self-produced
mixtape, Reurnof4eva, featured
big names like Chamillionaire
and Ludacris.
But the deep southern roots
of this self-proclaimed "King
Remembered in Time" (K.R.I.T.
- get it?) go a lot deeper than his
persona. And he has no interest
in producing pop-tart singles at
the expense of his creative free-
dom and strong morals.
"I was raised by my grand-
mother - after my parents split
apart, my grandma really showed
me the way," Big K.R.I.T. said in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily. "As far as how you treat
people, you treat people how you
want to be treated. And I try to
put that in my music, the honesty
is a big part as far as my music is
concerned."
K.R.I.T. grew up in the deep
South without much money to
his name, but he draws on his
upbringing to craft introspec-
tive, politically charged and
innovative cuts like the haunt-
ing "Hometown Hero," which
samples the British songstress
Adele's "Hometown Glory."
"Life is my subjectcmatter, con-
tent, it all derives from experi-
ences throughout my life - I just
really want to give other people
morals that I was taught when I
was raised," K.R.I.T. said, speak-
ing with the same rhythm and
diction as his raps. "I'm human,
I go through different things in
life. Some days I'm spiritual and
other days you just wanna hard-
core get money, you're struggling
through something, you're deal-
ing with relationships, and I'm
just kind of talking about it all."
On his latest release, Return-
of4eva, K.R.I.T. deals with rac-
ism, politics and the rap game
with tracks like the socially con-
scious and horn-infused "Anoth-
er Naive Individual Glorifying
Greed and Encouraging Racism."
K.R.I.T. may glorify the hip-hop
lifestyle, but he questions it with

FILM REVIEW
'Hanna' revels in blended innocence and violence

This juxtaposi-
tion of innocence and startling
violence perfectly represents
all of the things that make Joe
Wright's ("Atonement") new
thriller so downright cool.
Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, "The
Lovely Bones"), the girl in ques-
tion, is a killer on the run from
terrifying government agent
Marissa (Cate Blanchett, "The
Curious Case of Benjamin But-
ton"). After being raised and
trained in the Arctic wilderness
by her father, Erik (Eric Bana,
fa

"The Time Traveler's Wife"),
Hanna must outrun Marissa and
kill everyone that stands in her
way in order to rejoin her father
in Berlin. Entirely out of her ele-
ment in the real world, Hanna's
choice is simple: adapt or die.
While this may sound intrigu-
ing, it's not actually the plot of
"Hanna" that makes the film so
worthwhile. In fact, the predict-
able storyline and unsurprising
twists may be the film's weak-
est points. When the mysteries
surrounding Hanna's origin are
explained, viewers are left think-
ing: "Really? That's it?" Rather,
the film's true strength lies in its
direction. Wright takes a fairly

After four tough years,
it's time to let go

Eighth-inning comeback sparks
Blue's second Big Ten victory

I'll be honest. On several
occasions, in this column,
I've lamented - whined
even - about the last four years
of Michigan sports.
And at times, it has outright
sucked to know that these last
four years
have rendered
the football
team a mess,
the basket- '
ball team a
mediocre suc-
cess and the
hockey team RYAN
an incredible KARTJE
tease.
It's hard
not to be
upset. For those of us who have
been here for four years, the first
major sporting event we experi-
enced as students was a loss to
Appalachian State - the worst in
the history of Michigan football.
The last: Saturday's national
championship loss to Minnesota-
Duluth - one of the toughest
losses in the history of Michigan
hockey.
Standing in the front room of
the Blue Leprechaun on Saturday,
I thought it would be avenged.
It seemed this was a cruel joke,
one that would deliver its we-
were-just-kidding punchline
when Shawn Hunwick raised the
national championship trophy
Saturday night.
Alas, it was not meant to be.
So I trudged home, absolutely ill
from another tough loss. I was in
Fort Wayne during Michigan's
double-overtime regional loss
to Miami (Ohio) last year, and
I could only imagine this felt
worse.
But as I let the pain of this final
tragic punctuation to the last four
years hit me, I started to let go.

10th loss in MICHIGAN 6
their last PURDUE 5
11 games.
They hadn't scored more than
five runs in a game for nearly
a month and were about to get
swept by a conference rival.
Michigan would have fallen
to 1-5 in the Big Ten, and a cou-
ple more bad series would have
effectively shut the door on its
season.
But then, the Boilermakers
opened it back up.
A one-out error by second
baseman Eric Charles led to
four unearned runs in the eighth
inning, allowing Michigan to tie
the game 5-5. Each of the runs
scored with two outs.
Two innings later, redshirt
junior Garrett Stephens depos-
ited Sean Collins's 0-1 pitch over
the left-field wall to put Michi-
gan ahead, 6-5.
Freshman right-hander Alex
Lakatos let two reach base in the
bottom of the 10th inning, but he
slithered out of the jam to give
the Wolverines (2-4 Big Ten, 8-21
overall) a much-needed win in
West Lafayette.
"For the kids to come back
today (after losing Saturday) and
make plays like they did and get
some big hits, it says a lot about
them," Michigan coach Rich
Maloney said. "It would have
been easy to fold up shop and
they didn't. That was an awe-

some win for us."
Though the offense finally
came through to give the Wol-
verines a chance to win, the
defense kept it from losing the
game.
With the game tied, 5-5, in the
bottom of the ninth inning and a
man on first base with one out,
sophomore center fielder Patrick
Biondi made a spectacular run-
ning catch on the warning track
before throwingto firstto double
up the Purdue third baseman
Cameron Perkins. Had the ball
dropped, Perkins would have
likely come around to score the
game-winning run.
"Off the bat, I thought it was
hit pretty well," Biondi said. "I
opened up to my glove side and
the wind was blowing straight
toward left so I knew it was
going to turn back over. And I
turned back and whipped my
head around at the last second
and I was able to make the catch.
The ball carried a lot further
than I thought."
Added Maloney: "It was truly
one of the greatest catches I've
seen."
And in the 10th inning, Pur-
due put runners on second and
third base with one out. Stephens
came home with Boilermaker
shortstop David Miller's ground
ball to gun down the potential
tying run.
After Purdue jumped out to
a 5-1 lead in the second inning,
junior pitcher Brandon Sinnery
kept the Wolverines in the game
by throwing 5.1 innings of score-
less relief. Lakatos then tossed
3.2 more scoreless innings to
pick up the win.
Maloney said that Sinnery.
would likely take Mills's place
in the conference rotation after
Mills was shelled for five runs in
an inning of work.
The victory was especially
crucial consideringthat the Wol-

verines let Satqrday's game get
away. Behind a strong perfor-
mance from redshirt sophomore
Bobby Brosnahan, Michigan
took a 2-0 lead going into the sev-
enth inning.
But the left-hander loaded the
bases in the seventh and Lakatos
could not limit the damage when
he entered in relief Purdue (3-3,
10-11) scored four runs in the
frame and kept Michigan hitless
the rest of the way to get the 4-2
victory.
On Friday, the Boilermakers
pitching held Michigan to five
hits in an 8-0 rout.
But in a season in which Mich-
igan has been hard pressed to
find much reason for optimism,
Sunday's win could make a big

"It's huge," Biondi said. "It
would have been a really longbus
ride home if we got swept. But
everyone's pretty excitedthat we
were able to get that win and it
makes it a good bus ride home."
Michigan hopes to ride this
high into Ray Fisher Stadium as
it takes on Bowling Green and
Toledo during the week before
hosting Illinois this weekend.
"It shows a lot that we got
down and we were able to hang
in there and come back in the
end," Biondi said. "That shows
what kind of guys we have on
the team and hopefully this will
carry over and give us some
momentum next week."

BULLDOGS
From Page 1B

The Wolverines got out to
an early lead when senior for-
ward Ben Winnett scored his
fifth goal of the season - and
second goal of the Frozen Four
- five minutes into the first
period, but Minnesota-Duluth
sustained pressure on Michi-
gan defenders and senior net-
minder Shawn Hunwick all
night.
The Bulldogs tied the game
at one just under two minutes
into the second period and
then took the 2-1 lead eight
minutes later on the power
play. But led by a strong class of
seniors, Michigan kept confi-
dence high on the bench. It had
been down in plenty of games
this season, even in the NCAA
regional semifinal against
Nebraska-Omaha.
Near the end of the second
period, junior defenseman
Greg Pateryn slapped a shot
from the blue line in front of
Minnesota-Duluth netminder
Kenny Reiter. In front of the
net, sophomore forward Jeff
Rohrkemper got a hold of the
puck and back-handed it to
beat Reiter on the right side to
tie the game at two.

found a different guy to step up at
the right time.
Saturday night, Pateryn was
that guy. The junior defenseman
finished the game plus-1 with an
assist, and was responsible for
sending the game to overtime.
With less than 10 minutes to
go in the third period, Pateryn
and the Wolverines found them-
selves where they had been
nearly all game - on the penalty
kill. A boarding call brought the
Bulldogs' vaunted power-play
unit back on the ice for the ninth
and final time. Of Minnesota-
Duluth's 14 goals in the NCAA
Tournament, 11 of them came on
the power play.
The power play moved the
puck around until it came to a

The little man was the star of
college hockey's biggest stage.
But Rudy didn'tget a champion-
ship ring, and neither did Hun-
wick.
It wasn't for lack of goalmouth
heroics. With just over nine min-
utes left in the deadlocked, 2-2
game, Bulldog forward Mike Con-
nolly picked up a loose puck and
waltzed in on Hunwick. The path
was clear, Connolly just needed
to bury it like he had 28 times
already this season. Top shelf,

The puck smacked the netting
of Hunwick's glove.
"He's the one that got us here,"
senior Matt Rust said. "He played
great, made some (really) great
saves (Saturday). It's too bad."
In the postgame press con-
ference, Hunwick credited the
defense with playingsolid defense
in front of him.
But how could he? Hunwick
faced 78 shots in the Frozen Four.
He had to stave off 13 power-
play opportunities against North
Dakota and Minnesota-Duluth -
Michigan was lucky to even be in
striking distance of a title.
He wouldn't leave his team-
mates out to dry. Back in the lock-
er room, not on national television,
the goaltender finally opened up.
"I don't know if we played our
best defense - we came out tenta-
tive," Hunwick said.
Still, it was "we" that choked,

"we" that came up short in the
national championship game.
And fortunately for Beren-
son, the Wolverines and hockey
fans anywhere, that "we" will be
headlined by Hunwick's return
in the fall. No. 31 plans to return
as a fifth-year senior to backstop
Michigan in one final NCAA title
run.
"Every guy in this room that's
returning is going to have a bitter
taste in their mouth all summer
long," Hunwick said. "Losing in
overtime in the national champi-
onship game, you should be pretty
easily motivated."
The storybook ending got lost
somewhere in the excitement of
the Frozen Four, but the final twist
may be still to come.
"Being able to win a national
championship on mybirthday
would've been something I'd
always remember," Hunwick con-
tinued. "But I'll always remember
the guys in this room and the run
we went on."
For Hunwick, his legacy lies in
how this - his biggest failure at
Michigan - drives him.
Because while the film crews
shut down, the lights dim and the
madness subsides, this kid, with
tears in his eyes, knows he can be
more than just a good story.
And that's how legends are
made.

Senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick makes ose of his 35 sases against the Bulldogs is Saturday's championship tame.

Hunwick, who made 40
saves against North Dakota
on Thursday to lead the Wol-
verines to the NCAA Cham-
pionship, kept the Wolverines
in the game again on Satur-
day. Dubbed "Tiny Jesus" by
Michigan fans for his, at times,
indescribable saves in St. Paul,
Hunwick lived up to the nick-
name and got the Wolverines to
overtime against the Bulldogs.
While Hunwick kept the
Minnesota-Duluth offense and
power play at bay long enough

for the Wolverines to have a
chance on Saturday, sudden-
death overtime was a different
story.
At 3:22 into the extra frame,
Minnesota-Duluth senior Kyle
Schmidt's shot in front of the
net was the game-winner.
When Bulldog forward Travis
Oleksuk got the puck behind
the net on the right side of Hun-
wick, he slid it to Schmidt who
one-timed it to earn a National
Title for Minnesota-Duluth.
"It's a tough loss," Michi-

gan coach Red Berenson said.
"Shawn Hunwick was terrific.
He gave us a chance and it
wasn't to be."
Pateryn added: "We knew
it was going to be a really ugly
goal.

This won't be Lion Kim's last Masters appearance

AUGUSTA, Ga. -
Tiger's roar was back in
Augusta this weekend,
but for the first time, the
heart of a -
Lion made an
appearance as
well.
And it
won't be the
last.:
Michigan
senior Lion KEVIN
Kim came RAFTERY
into Augusta
National last
Monday as an unknown college
student who somehow had qual-
ified for the Masters by winning
the U.S. Amateur Public Links
in July.
Most figured it was a fluke.
Whispers of "Who is that
guy?" and "What is he doing
here?" could be heard on the
sidelines of the revered fairways
and outside the flawless greens
during the practice rounds Mon-
day and Tuesday.
By Friday, the whispers had
changed. For those who had
seen Kim play throughout the
week, they no longer had ques-
tions. They had statements.
"That kid is gonna be good,"
"He has some real talent," and
"I wonder when he's gonna turn
pro," replaced the questions
from earlier in the week.

Kim will be back to Augusta.
But it won't be long drives or
flashy shots that will get him
there. It won't be a Phil Mick-
elson-esque trick shot between
two trees - it'll be what lies just
inches away from the 'M' embla-
zoned on his polo all week long.
It'll be Kim's heart.
"Lion works harder than any-
body I've coached," Michigan
coach Andrew Sapp said the
week before Kim left for the
Masters.
It seemed cliche at the time
- a line any sports reporter has
heard hundreds of times about
many different players. Every
coach says that about his or her
captain.
But then I spent a week cover-
ing Kim, seeing his worth ethic
first-hand for five days.
During the practice rounds
Monday and Tuesday, Kim stud-
ied every angle on each green,
every shot from each fairway,
every drive from each tee box.
He spent hours on the range
and the putting green with cad-
die Louis Laurence and instruc-
tor Brian Mogg, working on
every possible shot he might
encounter on the No.1 golf
course in the world.
He picked the brains of PGA
Tour Champions Zach Johnson
and K.J. Choi, asking for any
advice they might be able to give

him - anything that could help
him weave his way through the
hallowed grounds of Augusta
National.
And within the first three
days, it was clear that Kim had
the work ethic to become a pro-
fessional golfer - though I still
wasn't convinced he was good
enough to be one.
That thought began to change
as soon as I saw him stripe the
first drive of his Masters career
down the middle and birdie the
hole, as thousands of fans looked
on in awe.
By the time Friday's round
came to a close, there was no
doubt that it wouldn't be Kim's
last time in Augusta.
Of the five birdies Kim tallied
in his two rounds, three of them
came after a bogey - and one
came on the first hole Thursday.
He never looked rattled,
always fighting back when he
had a bad hole.
While playing-mates Davis
Love III and Jose Maria Olaza-
bal fell further and further
down the leader board - Olaza-
bal finished plus-6 and Love,
plus-8 - Kim played on, compet-
ing as though he would be play-
ing through the weekend.
While Love III continually
missed putts inside ten feet,
mumbling to himself in frustra-
tion and staring up to the sky

COURTESY OF KEVIN RAFTERY
Senior golfer Lion Kim was impressive at Augusta National Golf Club last week despite missing the cut.

in disbelief, Kim continually
drilled the putts to stay in con-
tention, never allowing the fal-
ters of his playing mates or the
pressure of the situation get the
best of him.
He didn't have the booming
drives of Love III or the perfect
swing of Olazabal - but Kim
had the heart and the will that

neither of the other two had
during the week. There was a
reason he finished first of the
three.
And when it was all but over
on Friday - when the cut line
hovered around plus-1 and Kim
ended the two days at plus-4 - I
talked to Kim's caddy, Louis
Laurence.

"I'll bet he goes back to the
range now anyway," Laurence
said with a smile.
And with the roar of a Tiger
in the background, the heart of a
Lion went back to work.
He knows he'll be back.

Daily Sports Writer
Purdue senior hurler Suzie Rze-
gocki - arguably the best pitcher
in program history - stood in the
pitcher's circle, hands on her hips,
left without an answer.
The No. 4 Michigan softball
team (5-1 Big Ten, 35-3 overall)
manhandled the Boilermakers
(2-2, 24-10-1) in this weekend's
two-game series, taking the first
contest 13-1 and the second 10-0,
both in five innings.
Rzegocki started both games,
allowing 11 earned runs in the
first and five in the second before
finally being put out of her misery
after 2.1 innings. Despite being
the unquestioned ace on a Purdue
squad that entered the weekend
atop the Big Ten standings, she
left with her confidence shattered.
"The wins do a lot (for our con-
fidence)," junior third baseman
Amanda Chidester said. "Espe-
cially because we haven't been
hitting really well and that's what
we did this weekend.
"We came out and just hit the
crap out of the ball."
Michigan came to the plate for
just eight innings in two games -
both ending after four and a half
innings due to the mercy rule -
and scored at least one run in all
eight innings.
Everyone joined the hit parade
for the Wolverines, who knocked
four home runs in the first game
and two in the second.
Purdue started the series
strong, getting three straight hits
off Wolverine senior Jordan Tay-
lor. But the former All-American
settled down, allowing just one
run to cross the plate.
After that, it was all Michigan,
all weekend.

The Wolverines went on a tear
in the bottom of the first, scor-
ing six runs in the frame. The
explosion was highlighted by
Chidester's grand slam to deep
left field, a mammoth blast that
sent riled-up young fans deep into
the Schembechler Hall parking
lot to retrieve the ball.
Rzegocki pitched around
senior first baseman Dorian Shaw,
walking her to bring up Chidester
- a common theme this season -
and yet again, Chidester made the
opposing pitcher pay. It was her
seventh homer of the season and
her second grand slam.
Michigan added two runs in
the second, four in the third and
one in the fourth. Chidester hom-
ered again in the third and sopho-
mores second baseman Ashley
Lane and shortstop Amy Knapp
added blasts of their own.
Taylor went five strong, allow-
ing just four hits and one run and
striking out eight. Despite the
first-game rout, the Wolverines
had to return to the field less than
24 hours later to avoid a letdown.
"We played Purdue in 2006, I
believe, and we beat them 15-0.
We just killed them," Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins said. "And
the next day, we lost. Every day
is different so you've got to stay
even-keeled and we work really
hard for that."
And in a strange occur-
rence, the thermometer topped
80-degrees for Sunday's game,
though Michigan'sbats were even
hotter than the 1,361 sweating
fans that packed Alumni Field.
"It's softball season at its best,"
Hutchins said.
Shaw got the Wolverines start-
ed with an RBI-double in the first,
and that was all they needed.
Michigan ended the first inning

AAKE FROMM/Dly
Junior third baseman Amanda Chidester hit her seoenth home run on Saturday.

up 2-0, adding three more runs in
the second and a towering shot to
left-center by senior designated
hitter Alycia Ryan, which gave the
team a 6-0 lead.
A three-run shotby Lane - her
team-leading 13th - capped off
the scoring with Michigan lead-
ing 10-0.
Sophomore right-hander
Stephanie Speierman started
strong, but after running into
trouble in the fourth inning, she
was pulled for Taylor. As usual,
Taylor got the team out of trou-
ble with two on and one out, not
allowing the Boilermakers to tack
on a run.
Speierman finished her day
allowing just one hit, but her four
walks didn't please Hutchins.
"I pulled (Speierman) out
because she wasn't finding the
strike zone and I went out and
chatted with her and I didn't see
any change," Hutchins said. "You
know, three walks in a row is not

acceptable.
"She had only given up one
hit, but they're getting free bases
and a wild pitch ... and you know
what, at some point we determine
whether or not we think she has it
left, and we didn't think she had it
left, so I pulled her."
Still, Speierman got the win
and improved to a perfect 16-0 on
the season.
Taylor pitched 1.2 innings of
one-hit ball to finish the game, as
the Wolverines moved into a first-
place tie with Illinois in the Big
Ten standings.
"Well, first place is only at the
end of the season," Hutchins said.
"During the course of the season,
that's a bunch of garbage. They're
a good team and we certainly
didn't help their confidence.
"ButI tell my kids, you don't get
too high and you don't get too low.
You get too high on yourselves and
somebody will bust your bubble.
We're workingtowards May."

MEN'S TENNIS
Jung impressive in final regular-season match against Buckeyes

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - Sunday was not
a daymany Michigan men's tennis
players would like to remember.
But senior captain Jason Jung is
an exception.
After making the short bus trip
to Columbus, the No. 23 Michigan
men's tennis team lost to No. 3
Ohio State, 6-1. But that one Wol-
verine victory was a meaningful
upset by Jung of the No. 3 ranked
player in the country, freshman
Blaz Rola.
As the match got underway,
nobody expected Jung to pull off
the improbable victory. Though
Jung was the more experienced
college player, his opponentboast-

ed a ranking 54 spots ahead of
Jung.
Rola, the Slovenia native, had
tremendous success playing inter-
national junior tennis, including
several wins on the pro-circuit.
Rola's success has translated to
the college game, where he's lost
just two singles matches this sea-
son - unheard of for a freshman
in college tennis.
Yet none of that mattered. It
wasn't a junior tennis match, nor
was it a match on the pro-circuit.
It was a No. 2 singles college ten-
nis match that featured a fresh-
man with 19 career college singles
wins with a senior who had won
79.
Jung was one of five Wolverine
singles players who had a slow

start. He lost the first set, 6-3.
"Although the start wasn't real-
ly how I expected it, I think I did
really well," Jung said after the
match Sunday.
But once the second set start-
ed, Jung turned on the jets. He
stormed ahead of Rola 4-0 before
closing out the set, 6-1. Jung
played a flawless set, filled with
winner after winner. During the
set, Rola became flustered, as he
was unable to get anything going.
Jung put him on his heels, forcing
Rola to play defense the entire set.
The older Jung gave Rola a les-
son on how to play college singles.
Jung carried his stellar play
early into the third set and went
up an early break, 2-0. But as the
set continued, the wind picked up,

making it harder for both players
to execute their game plans.
"I think conditions were a lit-
tle tougher, which made it more
uneasy for both players, but I
have played in the wind enough to
know how to handle it," Jung said.
Not only did Jung know how to
handle the wind, but he also knew
how to handle Rola. After going
up early, Jung and Rola played on
serve for the remainder of the set.
At 5-4, Jung was serving for the
match. Jung quickly took a 40-0
lead in the game, leaving him
with three match points. On the
first point, Rola hit a solid return,
which Jung missed. The second
match point had a similar feel, as
Jung hit another unforced-error.
But Jung rebounded. He boomed

a serve that clipped the line before
jumping to Rola's backhand. Rola
couldn't handle the serve and he
blocked it back into the net.
"It just came down to a couple
points in the third set, and I took
advantage of it," Jung said.
The win was Jung's first over a
top-10 opponent all season and the
third loss of the season for Rola.
"(Beating No. 3) is definitely
a boost," Jung said. "I haven't
played too many guys ranked
ahead of me this year, but it's not a
surprise and Ithink it willbe good
for me for future matches."
Entering the match, Jung was
one win short of 80 career singles
wins, after beating Penn State in
another three set match on Fri-
day. But on Sunday, the senior

captain's upset over Rola gave him
that 80th victory, one that he will
remember.
"It was a really good win for
Jason," Michigan coach Bruce
Berque said. "I'm sure it makes
him feel really good to beat Ohio
State in his last regular season
match against them."
With 80 singles wins, Jung
inserted himself in the record
books once again as one of only a
few players to hold both 80 sin-
gles and doubles victories for the*
Maize and Blue.
"It's great that I have done
something good for my school, but
team-wise (the accomplishment)
has meant a lot more for me this
year than in previous years," Jung
said.
