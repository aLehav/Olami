ADMINISTRATION

 Under proposed 
changes, external 
party would handle 

appeals process

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

A draft of updates to the 

University’s 
Student 
Sexual 

Misconduct 
Policy 
released 

Thursday 
proposes 
revised 

investigation 
procedures 
that 

would allow students to appeal 
investigation 
findings 
to 
an 

external party.

Currently, 
appeals 
of 
an 

investigation 
finding 
are 

reviewed by the same board that 
handles appeals of sanction.

The 
release 
of 
the 
draft 

comes in advance of a series of 
roundtables aimed at gathering 
student feedback on potential 
changes to the policy.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said in September that 
an updated policy would be 
released “before the new year.”

“The 
External 
Reviewer 

will be a neutral party outside 
of the University, usually an 
attorney, with knowledge of 
sexual misconduct cases, as well 
as the University’s policies and 
procedures,” the draft policy 
reads. “The External Reviewer 
must also be impartial and free 
from bias or conflict of interest.”

The University would also 

move to identify all witnesses by 
name in investigative reports.

Additionally, 
a 
resolution 

officer 
— 
who 
previously 

resolved appeals to sanctions or 
resolutions handed down by the 
resolution coordinator — will no 
longer be involved in the process. 
An appeals board composed of 
one student appointed by Central 
Student Government and at least 
two faculty members, including 
one from the Law School, would 
make those determinations.

The 
policy 
would 
also 

explicitly state the instances 
when the sexual history of 
either party would be used in the 
investigation.

The 
draft 
version 
also 

includes a section dedicated to 
detailing the policy’s definition

Research Assistant Katrina Lewandowski and Research Lab Specialist Scott Beld carefully clean mud off a mammoth skull at the Ruthven Museum of Natural 
History on Thursday. The remains arrived at the museum yesterday after they were discovered beneath Jim Bristle’s soybean farm in Lima Township last week. 

Scientifically 

significant discovery 
to reside on campus 

permanently

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
mammoth 
of 
a 
fossil 

display may be on its way to 
the University’s Museum of 

Paleontology — as soon as 
paleontologists conduct further 
research and prepare the newly 
discovered bones for exhibition.

A 
team 
of 
University 

researchers 
excavated 
the 

remains of a prehistoric woolly 
mammoth last week at a dig site 
near Chelsea, Mich. The owner 
of the site, Chelsea farmer James 
Bristle, donated the bones to the 
Museum of Paleontology and the 
specimens began arriving in Ann 
Arbor this week.

Led 
by 
Daniel 
Fisher, 
a 

professor 
of 
ecology 
and 

evolutionary biology and director 
of the Museum of Paleontology, 
the team uncovered nearly 20 
percent of the animal’s skeleton, 
including a complete skull with 
tusks and teeth, vertebrae, ribs, 
pelvis and shoulder blades.

The mammoth is estimated 

to be an adult male that lived 
between 11,700 and 15,000 
years ago.

Bristle came across part of the 

pelvis bone when trying to install 
a drainage pipe in his field. He 
contacted the University team, 
who excavated what they could 
in a day, though they noted that 
there might still be some parts 
they may have missed.

Fisher 
said 
the 
find 
is 

significant because it may alter 
the date when paleontologists 
and historians believe humans 
first lived in North America.

Artists convene for 
‘basketball-playing 

robot music’ at 
TomorrowWorld

By ARIANA ASSAF

Daily Arts Writer

Last weekend, Sunshine Sachs 

was presented with a nightmare. 
The New York-based PR firm was 
tasked with saving face for an 
already dying company that was 
being held responsible for one of the 
most talked about music debacles 
this year.

Well, in my world it’s one of the 

most talked about music debacles 
this year, but that might have some-
thing to do with Facebook algo-
rithms. Let’s back up: on the final 
day of TomorrowWorld, a three-
day, three-year-old music festival 
in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, 
thousands of attendees were told 
they would not be allowed entry 
due to rainfall limiting “capacity 
of the parking lots, entrance roads 
and drop off locations.” The night 
before, tons of people were essen-

tially stranded in the forest after 
shuttles that were supposed to take 
them back to their cars, almost 10 
or so miles away, were cancelled for 
the same weather-related reasons.

Due to the beautifully mystical 

workings of the universe, I actu-
ally got to camp and attend the 
festival every day, and, let me tell 
you, it was wacky in all the best 
ways. I’m talking fire-breathing 
fish, trippy tapestries that pulsed 
under the influence of color chang-
ing light and maybe some other 
things (shoutout to BLVisuals — 
they’re based in Michigan! Go go 
go! ), and a huge rainbow marking 
the entrance to the campground 
that really made me feel as though 
I was walking into the best dream 
ever. I didn’t even care about having 
to slosh and ooze my way through 
mud for 10 minutes every time I 
wanted to leave my tent to pee.

I arrived on Friday morning 

and was immediately assisted by 
some very friendly staff in carry-
ing my stuff to an open spot. The 
campground known as Dreamville 
was buzzing with energy; people 
walked around blowing bubbles 
and getting to know each other and

Changes to 

emphasize clinical 
experiences during 
program’s first years

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Two years ago, the American 

Medical 
Association 
awarded 

a $1.1 million grant to the 
University’s 
Medical 
School 

to 
implement 
comprehensive 

curricular changes. This year, the 
changes are going into effect.

Rajesh Mangrulkar, associate 

dean 
for 
medical 
student 

education at the University, is 
leading the way in implementing 
the changes.

The new curriculum exposes 

students to the clinical setting 
as early as their first year and 
teaches them to have a greater 
understanding of the sociology 
and 
humanitarian 
side 
of 

medicine.

Mangrulkar said these changes

‘U’ prof. teaches class in tandem 
with Moscow State University

Trial section of 
course explores 
co-instruction 

with global partners

BY LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Ten University Honors stu-

dents are working alongside 
peers in Moscow in a trial sec-
tion of the humanities course, 
“The Land of Israel/Palestine 
Through the Ages.”

The partnership, four years 

in the making, may be the first 
of its kind, according to Rab-
binic Literature Prof. Yaron 
Eliav, who is leading the course 
along with faculty at Moscow 
State University. The class has 
been taught for 15 years at the 
University.

Eliav said the trial section of 

the course represents both an 
important global experience 
for students and a new way to 
think about classroom dynam-
ics.

“There’s a shift from a teach-

er-centered class to a student-
centered class,” he said. “All 

the way back to the Middle 
Ages, teaching was a professor 
providing information to his 
or her students. We’re kind of 
changing that.”

The students involved in 

this partnership have a video 
conference with their Russian 
peers once a week for discus-
sion led by either Eliav or the 
instructor in Moscow. The two 
courses are exactly the same, 
except for the language in 
which they are taught.

Students are also paired 

with a Russian peer to work 
on assignments and research 
projects, so they have regular 
contact with them outside of 
the general meetings.

“We discuss, unfortunately 

only in English, the topics of 
the course,” Eliav said. “This 
week we had a huge debate on 
the issue of ethnicity. Every 
week there is a discussion.”

LSA freshman Talia Katz, 

who is enrolled in the class, 
said she appreciates the dif-
ferent perspective her Russian 
peers provided.

“The language barrier is a 

little bit difficult to get across 
because some of them have 
limitations in regards to that,” 

she said. “It is really interest-
ing to discuss their point of 
view on modern issues based 
on some of the ancient his-
torical facts that we have been 
studying.”

The 
course 
was 
funded 

through a nearly $1 million 
grant from the University’s 
Third 
Century 
Initiative, 

which seeks to allocate fund-
ing to a series of academic pur-
suits, including broadening the 
University’s global reach.

Looking to the future, Eliav 

said he sees these kinds of glob-
al partnerships as an impor-
tant development in how the 
world of academia approaches 
teaching.

“We envision that learning 

in the 21st century will not be 
confined anymore to the Ann 
Arbor campus, as the world 
has become too small for that,” 
he said.

According to Eliav, six other 

universities from across the 
globe have expressed interest 
in joining in a similar partner-
ship, teaching a class alongside 
a University one. 

“The word is getting out,” he 

said. “People are hearing about 
this and they want to come.”

University announces summit, 
lectures on campus diversity

Campus-wide 
assembly slated 
to take place in 

November

BY ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Though 
University 
Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel has hosted 
several invite-only summits on 
diversity and inclusion since 
taking office last year, he is now 
taking those efforts campus-
wide.

In an e-mail released to facul-

ty, students and staff on Thurs-
day, Schlissel invited members 
of the community to join him 
for an interactive assembly to 
discuss diversity, equity and 
inclusivity on campus. Clarence 
Page, Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist and senior editorial 
board member of the Chicago 
Tribune, will join as the event’s 

host.

“The University of Michi-

gan is currently undertaking a 
campuswide strategic planning 
process to create our vision for a 
diverse, equitable and inclusive 
campus,” Schlissel wrote in the 
message. “Faculty, students and 
staff: Your voice, your partici-
pation and your ideas are vital 
to shaping the future of Michi-
gan.”

The assembly aligns with 

a strategic planning process 
Schlissel 
has 
launched 
to 

address issues such as campus 
climate and the University’s 
accessibility to minority stu-
dents. Schlissel has hosted two 
summits to discuss these topics 
and gather input toward the cre-
ation of a formal strategic plan 
for diversity. The most recent 
was held in September.

“Dedication 
to 
academic 

excellence for the public good 
is inseparable from our com-
mitment to diversity, equity and 
inclusion,” Schlissel said dur-

ing the September address. “We 
cannot be excellent without 
being diverse in the broadest 
sense of that word.”

Along with the community 

assembly, the University will 
host five events on diversity: 
a reflection on the history of 
campus diversity; a public lec-
ture featuring one of only three 
Black surgeon generals of the 
United States, a conversation 
titled Leadership for Diver-
sity in Higher Education: A 
System-wide Commitment; and 
the release of a staff committee 
report on diversity, equity and 
inclusion.

Schlissel previously appointed 

60 facilitators — representing 
each college and campus unit — 
to design programs for enhanc-
ing diversity unique to their unit. 
Those ideas would later be com-
piled into a larger, campus-wide 
vision for addressing the issue.

In an interview with the 

Michigan Daily last month, 
Schlissel said he hoped to see 
initial initiatives to increase 
campus diversity reflected in 
Fall 2016 enrollment figures, 
which are typically released in 
October.

“We 
began 
implementing 

some of the changes in the 
admissions and financial aid 
procedure a year ago,” he said. 
“We should start to see mod-
est incremental changes in the 
direction of diversity now.”

University conversations on 

diversity and race came to the 
forefront in 2013 when the Uni-
versity’s Black Student Union 
the #BBUM Twitter campaign, 
which 
encouraged 
students 

to share their experiences as 
Black students on campus. The 
hashtag spurred campus dia-
logue, particularly around the 
University’s decreasing minor-
ity population following the 
2006 voter-enacted affirmative 
action ban in Michigan.

According to last October’s 

enrollment figures, Black stu-
dents made up 4.63 percent of 
the undergraduate population 
in 2014.

curriculum, which often consists 
of teaching basic science and 
anatomy for the first two years, 
then clinical science for the last 
two years.

In line with this vision, one of 

the programs the Medical School 
launched this year was an “initial 
clinical experience” for its first-
year students. This program 
allows students to see firsthand 
how healthcare 
teams 
come 

together 
to 

provide 
good 

patient 
care, 

Mangrulkar 
said.

“Before, 

shadowing 
doctors 
and 

being 
in 
the 

clinic 
during 

the first year 
of med school 
was something 
you had to arrange for yourself,” 
said Charlie Frank, a first-year 
Medical School student, said. 
“But now, every other week 
we are in a clinic, shadowing a 
diverse healthcare team that not 
only includes doctors but includes 
other 
important 
healthcare 

professionals such as nursing 
assistants and social workers.”

In addition, a new “doctoring” 

course has been established for 
first-year students, where they 
will learn about clinical and 
interpersonal skills in medicine 
in an intimate setting with two 
faculty members who will work 
with them for their entire four 
years. 

Lastly, the Medical School has 

unveiled the MHome learning 
community for all of its students. 
The program divides students 
into houses, and each house has 
a director, faculty members, and 
students of all medical school 
years, Mangrulkar said.

This allows students to work 

within a smaller community, 
plan community service events 
and focus on integrating their 
learning across the curriculum.

Ed Hur, a second-year Medical 

School student, said MHome 

provides a great opportunity for 
older Medical School students to 
mentor younger ones.

“The idea of the MHome is to 

bridge the gap between first-, 
second-, third- and fourth-year 
med students,” Hur said. “We 
often have meet and greets with 
the first-year students, where 
older students like myself can 
give them advice on things such 
as research opportunities.”

Facility 
renovations 

accompany 
the 
curriculum 

changes. Among these is the 

Taubman 
Health 
Sciences 
Library, which 
underwent 
a 

$55 
million 

renovation. 
The 
new 

library 
was 

designed 
to 

bolster 
the 

improved 
model 
of 

medical school 
education.

“The new library supports 

team-based learning that focuses 
on problem solving,” Mangrulkar 
said. “This will support the idea 
of students being change agents 
in society.”

Curricular changes are not 

being introduced all at once, 
Mangrulkar said.

For example, the “Paths of 

Excellence” 
programs 
that 

were designed to allow students 
to focus on a specific area of 
medicine are being introduced 
gradually. Initially optional, they 
will now become mandatory for 
the incoming Medical School 
class.

Frank said initial feedback 

from the curricular changes has 
been positive overall.

“The way medicine has been 

taught for a long time is now 
outdated,” he said. “The best 
doctors of the future are those 
that not only have a strong basic 
science understanding, but also 
have excellent clinical skills, 
teamwork skills and a social 
understanding. Teaching these 
skills was nonexistent in medical 
school education before, but is 
now at the forefront of the new 
curriculum.”

was 

very much immersed in the 
Black community in Detroit 
and the Black circles across the 
country,” Ward said.

Born in Providence, R.I., in 

1915, Boggs was the daughter 
of Chinese immigrants. Early 
in her childhood, her family 
relocated to New York, where 
Boggs grew up. She completed 
her 
bachelor’s 
degree 
in 

philosophy at Barnard College 
and her doctorate in philosophy 
at Bryn Mawr College in 
Pennsylvania.

“I 
would 
describe 
her 

as 
a 
philosopher-activist,” 

Ward said, “She never taught 
philosophy, but philosophical 
thinking was always important 
to her.”

After 
participating 
in 

the March 
on 
Washington 

Movement — formed to protest 
segregation in the armed forces 
— in the 1940s, Boggs was 
inspired to continue fighting 
for equal opportunity for the 
Black community for the next 
seven 
decades. 
Influenced 

deeply by Marxism and left-
wing radicalism, she became 
active in the labor party, civil 
rights and the Black power 
struggles.

Ward 
said 
Boggs’ 
more 

visible 
accomplishments 

through the University, such 
as her honorary degree, were 
important, but what’s more 
noteworthy 
were 
the 
less 

visible displays of University 

friendship such as the years of 
guest lecturing.

“She didn’t just say what 

she had to say and leave. She 
really engaged with students, 
challenged 
students,” 
Ward 

said. “She challenged everyone 
she 
spoke 
with 
to 
think 

more deeply about what they 
were interested in and to see 
themselves as able to come up 
with the ideas and carry out 
the actions to bring about the 
changes that we need.” 

Ward 
said 
Boggs 
and 

her husband lectured at the 
University as early as 1962.

“She’s been 

coming 
to 

U of M for 
decades,” 
Ward 
said. 

“In the 1970s 
they 
started 

coming every 
year.”

Boggs 

settled 
in 

Detroit in 1953 
and 
shortly 

thereafter wed James Boggs, an 
employee of Chrysler and fellow 
civil rights activist.

Their 
home 
became 
a 

hub for visiting civil rights 
leaders, a breeding ground for 
fellow organizers hoping to 
see reforms for women, labor 
equality, education access and 
an 
end 
to 
institutionalized 

racial discrimination.

“From over seven decades 

of 
being 
an 
activist 
and 

writer there was this really 
rich network of overlapping 
communities,” Ward said.

Ward said Detroit was an 

important base for Boggs to 
develop her ideas and a network 
of activists because she saw the 
changes occur firsthand. 

“When she came to Detroit it 

was at its peak population of 2 
million,” Ward said. “She lived 
through the population and 

economic decline in those 60 
years.”

As 
of 
2013, 
Detroit’s 

population is 688,701.

Along with serving as an 

informal center for visiting 
activists, Boggs and her husband 
created several organizations 
to 
increase 
community 

development to combat the 
aftereffects of the Detroit race 
riots in the 1960s.

Boggs also continued the 

tradition of uniting communities 
through education and activism 
in Detroit later in life with 
the creation of her charter 

elementary 
school — the 
James 
and 

Grace 
Lee 

Boggs School 
— in 2013.

LSA 

sophomore 
Darian 
Razdar, 
an 

intern at the 
Boggs School 
last 
year, 

wrote in an e-mail interview, 
that his interest in human 
geography and radical social 
justice initially led him to apply 
for an internship.

“I saw a revolution happening 

at the Boggs School thanks to 
the visions of James and Grace 
Lee Boggs, and it continues to 
give me faith in the work we 
do,” Razdar said. 

Razdar added that he was 

intrigued by how the school 
operated under a model called 
Place 
Based 
Education, 
a 

learning process which allows 
students 
to 
explore 
their 

communities at young ages.

Amid these efforts, Boggs 

also continued political writing. 
She co-wrote the book “The 
Next 
American 
Revolution: 

Sustainable Activism for the 
Twenty-First Century” in 2011, 
describing how radical social 

change can be created in the 
modern world.

Ward 
said 
Boggs’ 
work 

profoundly 
influenced 

the 
reading 
materials 
and 

subject matter of his classes, 
which includes her book in a 
curriculum that centers around 
meaningful engagement with 
communities 
beyond 
the 

University.

Her involvement was also 

central 
to 
the 
University’s 

Semester in Detroit program.

Wards said Boggs had been 

involved with the program 
since its inception and was 
instrumental in the process.

“She was connected to the 

program from the beginning — 
in her work and her writing and 
these networks that she built 
were instrumental,” he said. 

Razdar, who participated in 

Semester in Detroit, wrote that 
the program helped inform his 
interest in connecting with the 
city.

“I had one of the most 

enriching 
educational 

experiences I could ask for with 
Semester in Detroit,” Razdar 
wrote. 
“All 
the 
academics 

provide a great context for 
actually living and engaging 
with the city through my 
internship, 
working 
with 

grassroots 
communities 
and 

just getting to know other 
people living there.”

Overall, 
Razdar 
said 
he 

thought Boggs would want 
those she educated to reflect 
back on her life and move 
forward with their activism.

“She’d want us to reflect on 

what she had taught us and to 
keep going, and planting the 
seeds for revolution in ourselves 
and our communities,” Razdar 
said. “So, that is what I have 
resolved to do in light of her 
death. Rest in Power, Grace 
Lee Boggs.”

here in North America by at least 
13,000 years ago. The mammoth 
shows signs of human association 
way before that,” he said. “The 
age of this mammoth could very 
easily be very old, and if we buy 
this theory of human association, 
then we can push back the time 
(humans) were here.”

The mammoth tusks, which 

contain growth layers, serve as a 
kind of record of the mammoth’s 
lifespan, according to Fisher. 
With further study, the team will 
be able to estimate the year the 
mammoth was born.

The 
team’s 
preliminary 

hypothesis on how the mammoth 
came to be buried in Chelsea is 
that early humans were storing 
its remains in a pond for later 
consumption.

That 
would 
also 
mean 

primitive 
humans 
would 

have had the technology and 
capabilities to hunt the large 
creatures, which has been the 
case in other prehistoric animal 
findings in Michigan.

Signs of human interaction 

would 
include 
cut 
marks, 

which would be found only 
after the bones are washed and 
cleaned.

The team also found a stone 

flake tool among the bones, 
which, 
Fisher 
hypothesized, 

could have been used by humans 

to cut mammoth bone.

Michael Cherney, a research 

assistant in the Museum of 
Paleontology 
and 
a 
Ph.D. 

candidate in geology sciences, 
said 
mammoth 
findings 
are 

comparatively less common in 
lower Michigan, noting that 
mastodon findings are actually 
more common locally.

According to Smithsonian 

Magazine, 
mastodons 
and 

woolly mammoths are two 
distinct 
shaggy-haired 

species, though they are both 
considered 
proboscideans, 

which are generally described 
as species of animals with 
tusks and trunks.

“There 
are 
around 
300 

mastodon 
skeletons 
recorded 

for Michigan,” Cherney said. 
“There’s only on the order of 30 
mammoth sites, and most sites 
only include a few bones here and 
there.”

Cherney 
and 
Fisher 
both 

stressed that there is much work 
to be done in terms of dating and 
researching the recovered bones, 
but the significance of the find is 
already apparent.

“Just 
the 
fact 
that 
it 

has tusks and teeth, it’s a 
significant find that it has 
those 
things, 
and 
they’re 

preserved well enough that 
we should be able to say a lot 
more,” Cherney said. “If the 
date turns out to be very old, it 
could be quite significant, but 
it is hard to say at this point.”

of consent. The core of the 
definition — “Consent is a clear 
and unambiguous agreement, 
expressed outwardly through 
mutually 
understandable 

words or actions, to engage in a 
particular activity” — remains 
unchanged.

However, the drafted policy 

outlines 
several 
clarifying 

bullets, including the idea that 
“Consent is not 
to be inferred 
from 
silence, 

passivity, 
or a lack of 
resistance, 
and 
relying 

on 
non-verbal 

communication 
alone may not 
be 
sufficient 

to 
ascertain 

Consent.”

In April, a 

Michigan Daily report pointed 
to a discrepancy between the 
definition of consent taught by 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center — which 
promotes consent as requiring 
verbal agreement — and the 
official policy, which does not.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president 
for 
student 
life, 

sent an e-mail to the student 
body on Oct. 1 advertising the 
roundtables, and also promoted 
a digital feedback survey for 
those who cannot attend in 
person.

In February 2014, the U.S. 

Department 
of 
Education 

announced 
it 
would 

investigatethe 
University’s 

handling of sexual misconduct 
reports. That investigation is 
ongoing.

In a September interview 

with the Daily, Schlissel said he 
hoped to unveil updates to the 
sexual misconduct policy before 
the new year.

“The goal of making change is 

to have the process be as fair as 
possible to the complainant and 
the respondent to help us arrive 

at a decision 
which is the 
right 
one,” 

Schlissel 
said.

Last 

January, 
Schlissel 
announced 
a survey to 
gauge campus 
climate 
on 
sexual 

assault. 

According 
to 
the 
survey 

results, 11 percent of University 
students reported experiencing 
nonconsensual sexual behavior 
over the course of the 2014-2015 
academic year.

“As a university president, a 

physician-scientist, an educator 
and a father, the issue of sexual 
misconduct keeps me awake at 
night,” Schlissel said when the 
survey results were released 
in 
July. 
“I 
feel 
personally 

responsible for the safety and 
well-being of all students at the 
University of Michigan.”

Re-creating my roots

T

here’s a new unfamiliar 
sight in the Motor City 
amid all the usual con-

struction 
sites: 

train tracks.

They 
sit 

unfinished and 
in pieces, as they 
will for at least 
another 
year 

and a half. It’s 
supposed to be 
a sign of the new 
Detroit, a city 
finally emerging 
from its toils and 
recessions. 
For 

now, it’ll just be 
the familiar site of the unofficial 
state flower — the orange construc-
tion cones — but at least anything is 
better than the “People Mover” and 
the couple dozen people it moves 
each day.

It’s not the first time in Detroit’s 

history when the streets were 
shared between cars and trains. 
Streetcars used to carry passen-
gers around the city up until the 
mid-1950s, with major lines on 
Michigan Avenue, Gratiot Avenue, 
Jefferson Avenue and Woodward 
Avenue, exactly where the M-1 Rail 
will run. They might have been 
replaced by buses and taxis, but 
here we are, coming full circle back 
to the train era.

Some places in Detroit, you can 

see remnants of the tracks. They 
never took them out of the streets, 
just paved over them. They peek 
through cracks in the concrete 
in spots, a reminder of a differ-
ent past. Along Michigan Avenue 
in Corktown, the uneven brick 
road remains except for a strip of 
messy asphalt in the middle lane, 
covering where streetcars used to 
shuttle passengers from the now-
abandoned Michigan Central Sta-
tion to Downtown. The past is 
still there, unable to be removed, 
instead just poorly covered.

Such is the way of Detroit. For 

every person who hails the city’s 
rebuilding process as a successful 
blueprint for American cities, there 
is someone in a Detroit neighbor-

hood who claims to be forgotten. 
It’s still there, underneath all of the 
new development, poorly covered 
and only seen through the cracks in 
the surface.

There’s no doubt that much of 

Detroit is different. It’s visibly 
different with filled storefronts, 
offices and apartments. It’s eco-
nomically different as it emerges 
from its bankrupt past. The Spirit 
of Detroit statue may have never 
left, but the spirit itself is noticeably 
different throughout.

Yet, as I take my shortcuts 

through city outskirts to play in 
this rebirthing city or eat at anoth-
er new restaurant that just opened, 
the areas where so 
much of the inner-
city Detroiters live 
— outside of the 
Downtown 
and 

Midtown 
bustle 

— hardly look dif-
ferent 
than 
they 

were before. The 
burned-out houses 
and 
boarded-up 

windows remain. The highways 
are newly paved for suburbanites 
to commute, but city-street pot-
holes turn into fishing holes. The 
closed schools still sit abandoned, a 
reminder that the foundation of the 
future, the education of the youth 
in the city, remains perilously inad-
equate.

The leaders of these efforts say 

the city will benefit from addition-
al jobs and taxes, results that will 
trickle down into better services 
for residents. And sure, recent city 
plans like District Detroit show 
ideas for a newly revitalized city 
that’s far better than the previous 
iterations. But it would be naïve 
to believe that a new sports arena, 
shopping district and business 
offices are anything but more for 
those outside the city limits with 
money. Upwards of $280 million 
in Detroit taxpayer funds is being 
used to subsidize the costs and tax-
payer-funded efforts rarely provide 
any measurable positive, economic 
impact on a city (instead often neg-
ative impact). Detroit is forgetting 

its own residents who were forced 
to deal with the worst years of the 
downturn and are left behind, the 
city reforming without them. 

The stadiums do little for them. 

A new Whole Foods doesn’t solve 
inner-city problems. The problems 
aren’t bottom lines and business 
economics. The problems are no 
different than the problems of any 
inner city for the last half century. 
Those in the suburbs can get what 
they want with such developments, 
but the forgotten residents of the 
city need developments for the 
issues they want fixed as well.

Detroit will always have to face 

the economic and racial tensions 

that plague every 
big 
city 
in 
this 

country. 
Detroit 

News 
columnist 

Nolan Finley wrote 
a striking column 
about the business-
centered 
trans-

formation 
that 

has been the new 
Detroit rage in the 

news, a piece titled “Where are 
the black people?” In the article, 
Finley discussed the demographic 
differences between the city resi-
dents and those leading the revival. 
Though it may not be literal gen-
trification in the real estate of the 
city quite yet, these residents are 
already at risk of being pushed out 
of the city. Detroit must remember 
it’s far more than a trendy center 
of revitalization, but a city with 
hundreds of thousands of residents 
in need of the rewards of a turn-
around as well.

So, Detroit moves forward build-

ing new train tracks, paving over 
the old city, forgetting its struggles. 
Like the old tracks, the people the 
new Detroit paves over, the resi-
dents who struggled with the city 
for so long, will peek through the 
cracks where the cover breaks. The 
city can’t let them meet the fate 
of the old streetcars if it wishes to 
move forward.

Remembering the tracks

DAVID 
HARRIS

I 

stepped out of the airport, 
inhaling the smell I had been 
craving for a decade: Hyder-

abad, India.

I soaked up 

the sounds of the 
rickshaws 
and 

cars in one of 
the most densely 
populated cities 
in the world. I 
drove by people 
bargaining over 
sweet 
man-

goes 
dressed 

in 
shalwar 

kameez in all 
colors, T-shirts 
and jeans, or covered head to toe. 
I passed the old mosque and the 
Hindu temple, and stared up at 
the new railway being built to run 
through the city. I saw the old and 
the new of the place where I had 
spread my roots.

Hyderabad is a city in India 

where there’s approximately one 
Muslim family for every Hindu 
family. The streets are filled with 
people living peacefully in a place 
with a rich history involving both 
religions that overlap in Hyder-
abadi culture. Instead of saying 
the Hindu “namaste” or the Mus-
lim greeting “asalamu alaykum,” 
Hyderabadis say “adaab” as a sign 
of respect for both. 

Hyderabad is special for me, as 

it is the place my Dadi, my paternal 
grandmother, still lives and where 
my maternal grandparents lived 
before moving to Pakistan. For the 
people who know the political his-
tory of India and Pakistan, that may 
seem like a striking combination. 
But it’s not as dramatic as a Bolly-
wood movie; it’s simply a part of my 
family’s cultural background.

When I arrived at my Dadi’s 

house this summer, I felt at home 
walking along the green concrete 
walls, passing a sign on the door 
welcoming people in to pray and 
break their fasts at the end of each 
day during Ramadan. Watching my 
Dadi, a retired English professor, 
tend to these people who came to 
stop and rest reminded me of where 
I got some of my best traits; finding 
joy in the simplicity of family and 
serving others is a familial trait. I 
remembered my late grandfather, 
who started the tradition of letting 
the community gather in his home.

I found the same compassion in 

Dadi’s eyes that I see in my par-
ents and in the people of Hyder-
abad, a community that feels close 
and small, even though it’s a large, 
densely 
populated 

city. The city’s inhab-
itants, most of whom 
have never met me, 
welcomed me as if 
I had always been 
there. People in the 
community act like 
they are my Dadi’s 
children themselves, 
as they bring over home-cooked 
meals and ask about her well-being. 
They see her as a resource and ask 
her for advice, whether it be about 
their family or even marriage. 
Though my father, four uncles and 
aunt are dispersed throughout 
America and England, they still 
live by the principle they learned in 
Hyderabad: caring for their mother 
and their community. They take 
turns going to visit her, so that she 
is always taken care of.

In my culture, the concept of 

family is central to the way people 
interact with one another, regard-
less of their relation, and the elder-

ly are treated with great care and 
esteem by the community. In Amer-
ican culture, as anthropologist 
Jared Diamond discussed, the “cult 
of youth” and emphasis on indi-
vidualism take precedence over the 
family structure. Though there’s 
value in youth and individualism, I 
have a difficult time grasping some 
of the attitudes toward family in 
American culture. Even after com-
ing to the University, I still go back 
to my parents’ home every week-
end, as do my brothers even though 
they are married with their own 
families. Often when I tell people 
this, they’re shocked at the idea, as 
many people only go home for the 
holidays even if they live nearby.

My Indian-Pakistani commu-

nity still holds some of these prin-

ciples 
as 
well. 

It’s respectful to 
greet elders as 
soon as you see 
them. If anyone 
we know is ill, 
everyone 
and 

their family goes 
to the hospital 
to see them and 

ensure they are getting the best 
care. That’s how the community 
functions as a large family and a 
support system that is always there 
when you need it most. Recreating 
that feeling even in America may 
be difficult, especially as consid-
ering that each succeeding gen-
eration has a weaker attachment 
to Hyderabad both in space and 
time, but having the support of 
my Hyderabadi cultural ideals is 
invaluable and worth the work it 
takes to recreate.

FROM THE DAILY

A

ccording to the U.S. Census Burea data released last month, 
women in Michigan make approximately 75 cents for every 
dollar earned by their male counterparts; nationally, women 

make 79 cents for each dollar. Though this statistic is startling on its 
own, it fails to take into account the additional income discrepancies of 
African-American and Hispanic women: 64 and 53 cents to the dollar, 
respectively. Experts predict that if this trend continues, women will 
not achieve full pay equity until the year 2086. The wage gap stems from 
a complex cultural problem that won’t be solved overnight, but that 
doesn’t mean proactive steps can’t be taken today. Michigan legislators 
need to adopt legislation that will support both mothers and fathers 
taking time off to care for their children. Simultaneously, parents, 
educators and other leaders must strongly encourage both sexes, not 
just males, to explore corporate and STEM fields where interest exists.

Bridging the gap

The state must take proactive steps to decrease the wage gap

In the crossfire of the 2016 election season, 

the infamous gender wage gap has made its 
way to the forefront. Democratic presidential 
candidates Hillary Clinton, who sponsored 
the Paycheck Fairness Act to address income 
disparity, and Bernie Sanders, who voted in 
favor of the act, have been at the helm of this 
issue from the beginning, forcing their fellow 
candidates to follow suit. While the debate 
surges on at the national level, its effects are 
taking their toll right here at home. Michigan 
is currently ranked 42nd in the country on the 
issue of gender-based income equality.

While there is no quick fix for this truly con-

voluted problem, there are several measures 
the state can take to prevent the wage gap from 
becoming an insurmountable gorge. The first 
of these solutions that should be considered 
is the FAMILY Act, which would partially 
compensate workers for up to 12 weeks for an 
absence due to birth, death or a medical emer-
gency in their immediate family. As of right 
now, the bill is a low priority, but its passage 
is guaranteed to significantly benefit women, 
who are statistically less likely than men to 
pursue full-time work in favor of managing 
their household affairs. So far, a few states — 
including California, New Jersey and Rhode 
Island — have passed this legislation, and the 
University itself has even implemented a com-
parable worker compensation policy, yet the 
state of Michigan has not actively promoted 
any major regulations that resemble the pro-
posed bill.

According to the 2009 census, despite 

comprising approximately 48 percent of the 
workforce, women occupy just 24 percent of 
jobs in STEM fields — which is unfortunate, 
because women in STEM earn an average of 

33 percent more than women in non-STEM 
occupations and consequently experience a 
smaller wage gap. While programs with cam-
paigns to recruit girls and young women into 
the STEM fields, such as Women in the Sci-
ences and Engineering, have gained traction 
in recent years, and some colleges and orga-
nizations have even offered scholarships that 
can fund the tuition for female students who 
pursue STEM majors, cultural barriers that 
deter women from this occupational sector are 
undoubtedly still present.

The social norms that govern our behavior 

have inevitably carried over into the work-
force; female scientists, in particular, bear the 
brunt of this stereotyping, marginalization 
and discouragement, which could explain why 
women constitute just 25 percent of computer 
scientists and a mere 13 percent of engineers. 
Amending this imbalance requires educa-
tors to encourage boys and girls equally from 
a young age to pursue their passions without 
fear of ridicule or discrimination, which can 
be achieved through modification of our state-
wide approach to STEM education.

The wage gap is the symptom of our own 

deep-seated prejudices and severely gendered 
culture. Nearly a century after women began 
entering the workforce, we still have not 
learned to regard them as our equals in terms 
of both capability and talent. Making accom-
modations for workers with families, as well as 
supporting women who pursue corporate and 
STEM positions, is a step in the right direction 
for a country with a long history of workplace 
inequality. Now with a handful of presidential 
candidates shedding light on the issue, per-
haps we will not have to wait 71 years for jus-
tice that is long overdue.

A

fter the painfully awkward years of 
middle school, when making oth-
ers uncomfortable wasn’t a voluntary 

activity, I’ve learned how 
fun it is to make people 
feel just a little awkward 
themselves. My favorite is 
buying a box of tampons, a 
box of tissues and a box of 
chocolate at the same time, 
then making sure I go to a 
male cashier. Another fun 
one is being frank with 
people. For example, tell-
ing someone you’re “talking 
to” (whatever that means), 
“Hey, I’m getting mixed sig-
nals. Rather than playing this game with you, 
I’m going to ask you what you want from me. So 
here I am, please tell me what is on your mind 
so that there’s no misunderstanding between us 
and I can move on with my life.” That one really 
makes people uncomfortable.

However, my new favorite is going to the 

weight room at the gym.

I’m usually one of the only girls in there, 

if not the only one, and I’m not surprised. 
Almost immediately, I feel like a giant ele-
phant in the room. Let’s just run with this 
theme, because it also makes me feel like an 
animal at the zoo. It’s almost as if there is an 
informational sign on my ass, reading, “While 
you might hold some preconceived notion 
that this species is usually found in its natu-
ral habitat of elliptical machines and Pilates 
classes, we have placed a rare breed in this 

specially constructed room with you so that 
you can lose your shit while she deconstructs 
your standards.”

Yes, it’s possible to be a little less blatant 

with your disbelief. Is it that insane to you 
that a girl could possibly be strong enough 
to bench press? Is it that foreign to you that a 
girl has every right to use the pull-up bar, no 
matter how desperately unsuccessful she is at 
actually pulling herself up? Is this your space 
that I am somehow invading?

Maybe I’m like an animal that has escaped 

at the zoo. Yeah, elephants are majestic as 
fuck, but you wouldn’t want one running 
toward you. You wouldn’t want a girl who has 
enough physical strength to be in your sweaty, 
grunting, clanging, manly room of mirrors. 
You wouldn’t want a girl who doesn’t give two 
shits about how disgustingly sweaty she is. 
(Oh, did I say disgustingly? I meant impres-
sively.) You wouldn’t want a girl who can lift 
her fists to the sky with a dumbbell in each 
hand because goodness, girls are supposed to 
have slim shoulders that don’t threaten your 
masculinity. You wouldn’t want a girl who 
does push-ups instead of letting people push 
her down; who gives new meaning to “curls 
for the girls”; who doesn’t need you to spot 
her, in either sense of the word, because she 
came to the gym to become stronger, not to 
get your attention.

Yes, as much as it may startle you, I’m there 

because I like to work out. That’s it.

At first, I hated it. Walking into that room 

was intimidating and uncomfortable, and 
I spent way too much time trying to find

the most inconspicuous corners 
of the room to work out in. And 
I know I’m not alone. One of my 
friends has even taken the step of 
purchasing her own dumbbells to 
use at home because she doesn’t 
want to deal with the unrelenting 
stares and the pervasive sense 
of hostility. Some of my friends 
have even given up on the idea of 
weightlifting because of this. But 
once I felt like I actually knew 
what I was doing (thanks, brothers, 
for teaching me how to properly get 
shredded), it became clear who was 
really uncomfortable.

Now, I just like to watch them 

squirm. Sometimes they stare with-
out even noticing, 
until I look them 
in the eye and they 
freeze like I’m some 
sort of basilisk. I’m 
focusing on me, and 
if you also want to 
focus on me, fine. 
I’ll just make more 
gains than you. You 
won’t find me in the zoo. You’ll find 
me doing Tough Mudders, mov-
ing out of apartments by myself, 
and eating lots of peanut butter 

for that “extra protein.” You’ll 
find me unabashedly wiping my 

body-shaped layer 
of sweat from the 
bench press. Maybe 
one day you’ll find 
me actually suc-
ceeding at doing 
a pull-up. You can 
stare at me all you 
want, but you can’t 
cage me. And I love 

how uncomfortable that makes you.

doling out high fives just because. 
In fact, a bridge that connected the 
campground to one area of stages 
often turned into a long line of com-
ers and goers extending their hands 
seeking to give and receive valida-
tion of whatever they were wear-
ing, saying, or feeling. If that sounds 
adorable to you, you’re so right

All nine stages were perfectly 

arranged so that the sound stayed 
concentrated exactly where it was 
supposed to be, though several stag-
es could be seen from many vantage 
points. You could always figure out 
what was going on across the way 
pretty easily, and it made the lineup 
of over 200 artists feel very manage-
able. The decor was outstanding: 
the main stage in particular was so 
smiley and massive it felt like it was 
hugging 160,000+ people at once. 
The ground’s lakes were converted 
into light-up fountains that gave off 
a magic castle vibe, and the random 
figures that could have come from a 
children’s storybook were arranged 
in various locations so that you’d 
always have something sweet to 
look at. I probably wasn’t supposed 
to get right up close, but one partic-
ular spot of larger-than-life mush-
rooms tucked behind a white picket 
fence made for a great spot to sit and 
let my thoughts swirl while watch-
ing everyone empty out at the end of 
the day. It was all very irresistible.

Unfortunately, not everyone left 

TomorrowWorld feeling as warm 
and fuzzy as I did. Not everyone 
gleefully welcomed the sleep depri-
vation that comes with raging for 
3-to-5 days, because a lot of people 
were sleep deprived after having 
spent Saturday night on a long trek 
back to their respective cars. My 
TomorrowWorld experience left 
me with nothing to desire but more 
of the perfect same, yet I can’t just 
leave out the not-so-perfect parts 
and pretend like everything was 
great for everyone. Before get-
ting into the nitty gritty, I’d like to 
praise the members of the Sunshine 
Sachs team I was in contact with 
both leading up to and during the 
festival. It’s obvious you gals and 
guys work crazy hard and I’m sure 
I can’t even begin to comprehend 
how many hours you put into this 
weekend. Thank you to tomorrow 
and beyond for working everything 
out for me.

To give you a little background, 

TomorrowWorld is a brand owned 
by SFX Entertainment. SFX was 
worth $1 billion in October 2013 
at $13 a share. Near the end of this 
August, the value of the company 
dropped to $88 million at 91 cents 
a share. When the market closed on 
Sept. 24, the day before Tomorrow-
World, SFX shares were only worth 
43 cents each.

Early Saturday evening, I and 

every other press attendee received 
a very proper e-mail from Sun-
shine Sachs, optimistically letting 
us know that guest safety was pri-
ority, that they were working to 
address the challenges the weather 
presented and that they felt lucky 
the festival site had such a “strong 
infrastructure.” I think sending that 
e-mail was a mistake. If the infra-
structure was so strong, neither 
shuttles nor Sunday entry should 
have been so drastically affected. 
But the market has spoken, and it 
tells me that cancelling was prob-
ably the easiest, cheapest, and safest 
thing for SFX to do. The value of the 
company is so low it couldn’t really 
get much lower anyway, and this 
eliminated the risk (however small 
or large is a different question I’m 
not capable of answering) of them 
getting even more bad flack if some-
thing worse than a really long, cold, 
fucked up walk were to happen to 
anyone.

Right now, SFX is doing so badly 

it’s on sale to the highest bidder. It 
would have been so great for orga-
nizers to have made the people 
whose weekend they ruined feel 
respected instead of neglected. But 
considering that the company had 
already been on a steady path to 
doom, I can’t help but think they 
just didn’t want to deal with it any-
more.

I think that if capitalism had 

told SFX that making that long, 
cold, fucked-up walk less fucked-
up would have been worth it, they 
would have cared, and they would 
have actually done something. 
I certainly felt cared for when 
I arrived on Friday, but various 
accounts tell me there was hardly 
a staff member in sight when shut-
tles no-showed on Saturday night. 
Help was even harder to find for 
campers making their way off the 
grounds on Monday; all the assis-
tance attendees had been offered 
on the way in what was entirely 
lacking on the way out. Suffice it 

to say that SFX dropped the ball 
on multiple accounts, and leav-
ing people with a pathetic apology 
dripping in stone cold PR profes-
sionalism just doesn’t cut it.

As someone who has learned a 

whole lot more about music and 
the music industry in the past few 
days than pretty much ever before, 
a quote I read from SFX founder 
and CEO Robert Sillerman in this 
Forbes article from the end of 
August seriously freaked me out: “I 
know nothing about EDM ... I meet 
the people whose places we’re buy-
ing. And I haven’t a fucking clue 
what they do or what they’re talking 
about. Not a clue. And I love it. I just 
love it.” Good for you, Bob, good for 
you. I’m glad you love EDM. So do 
I. But you have to know you sound 
like a douche. I realize I’m doing 
that thing that people hate journal-
ists to do in taking your quote out 
of context, but how many different 
interpretations of that statement 
are there? Are you actually the 
guy who buys and sells and tries 
to manipulate the fate of music 
because you think you know how 
much it’s worth? I’m sure you’re not 
a douche, but I think it’s safe to say 
you have more to learn about your 
own business. That’s awfully disap-
pointing, and I won’t be surprised 
if future TomorrowWorlds are run 
by anyone else. At least we can take 
comfort in the fact that even if SFX 
goes kaboom, and on the off chance 
TomorrowWorld ceases to exist, the 
spirit of music will never die. How 
many of you just rolled your eyes 
at me? You were supposed to. Don’t 
worry, now we can talk about the 
fun stuff.

My first day lineup included the 

likes of Dotcom slaying the It’s A 
Trap! stage (highlight: something 
about giving a fuck. “Nope.” BASS 
DROP AAAAH), a crash course in 
hardstyle at the Q-dance stage, and 
making the ridiculously surprising 
discovery that — brace yourselves — 
Shaq is a DJ now. No, it’s not some 
dude who tried to be clever and call 
himself Shaq (I was wrong), and 
he might have had the best set of 
the day. Mainstage headliners that 
night included Showtek, Steve Ang-
ello, Kaskade and Tiësto, and after 
roughly a week of processing what 
I heard during my time stopping in 
at the main stage between every-
thing else that was going on, I think 
I finally get it ... that was “big room 
house”, right?

Anyway, it wasn’t actually that 

interesting. I mean yeah, it’s great 
and energetic and fun and we were 
all was dancing our asses off, but 
one set didn’t really make me feel 
that much different than the other. 
And I don’t know, I could have used 
a little more “je ne sais quoi” with 
that one hand gesture everyone 
makes when they say that, instead 
of coming away not really knowing 
how to describe it because it didn’t 
really stick with me. That said, Tiës-
to (and the rest of you), I still want 
to hug you and your smiley Dutch 
self forever. Please be my fairy god-
mother, I feel like we would have so 
much fun together.

So many amazing people played 

on Saturday (you don’t need the 
list, just look here if you wanna 
be insanely jealous of me) but the 
Mythical Frames stage at the end 
of the day stole my heart. Grama-
tik you sexy motherfucker, what 
even was that? On Saturday night 
(during his officially scheduled set), 
he spun out all these crazy break-
downs that literally had my brain 
going 100 miles a second. I don’t 
really remember if I moved along 
or if I tried; mostly I just remember 
thinking, “Holy shit.” He was jazzy 
and funky and innovative and did I 
mention sexy? SO SEXY.

Speaking of sexy, let’s talk 

about the beatboxer who came on 
between Gramatik and Bassnectar 
and gave everyone the most surpris-
ing five minutes of the weekend. 
Seriously, it was filthy. Go watch 
the video — start halfway through if 
you’re really only trying to procras-
tinate a little you good student you--
and try telling me you don’t want to 
know what else Reeps One can do 
with his mouth. Bless.

While some people’s nights 

unfortunately turned to muck (ha 
ha), others who rightfully decided 
they weren’t going anywhere got 
treated to a late-night dance party 
after the rest of the music had 
stopped for the night, courtesy of 
none other than Gramatik. Dude, I 
don’t know why you did it (although 
I’m actively trying to reach him to 
get the scoop), but I would person-
ally like to thank you and/or who-
ever got you to go back up there. You 
rock, we love you. SFX, take a hint 
from this guy please.

Sunday 
was 
so 
bittersweet. 

The only bad thing about (my) 
Sunday was that I knew it would 
all be over in about 16 hours, when 
my 
thankfully-not-dead-by-then 

iPhone alarm would strike 4:45 
a.m. and I would have to grab my 
bag and get on a bus back to the 
airport and ultimately, back to real 
life. Fortunately I saw a guy running 
around with a flag that said “Fuck 
Real Life” several times that day, so 
that made me feel a little better.

The musical talent was of course 

out of this world. Appropriately, my 
day started with a phenomenal set 
by Space Jesus. I got to spend some 
time at the ironically named Grand 
Theatre later in the day, a tiny little 
outcrop of a stage that served as an 
experimental stomping ground for 
lesser known but very snazzy art-
ists like Kink, Faul & Wad Ad and 
many more. Milo & Otis were the 
perfect amount of naughty, Mar-
tin Garrix has done some growing 
up (mostly just physically, but he’s 
getting there), David Guetta was 
very impassioned, Flux was hilari-
ous and crazy, Excision killed, and 
Armin was predictably loveable. Oh, 
and there were fireworks both in 
the sky and in my head. It was great.

I got to ask Jasha Tull (Space 

Jesus) to describe his music via 
an e-mail interview. Although 
his answer is specific to his style, 
it’s totally excellent, and I think 
it speaks to the overall spirit of 
TomorrowWorld: extremely talent-
ed, outrageously creative, entirely 
wacked out, and full of heart.

“I would describe my music as 

channeling of inexplicable brain 
tickles to create sounds for robots 
and humans to play basketball to. 
When I write music I try to explore 
the confusion of alien sounds with 
innate musical nostalgia that exists 
within us all. In terms of a specific 
feeling I’m looking to evoke through 
my music, it would be the feeling 
of conceptualizing the universe, 
accept infinity, anything is possible. 
So my message would be to medi-
tate on what i just said while you 
snap your neck back and forth to a 
ice-cold hip hop beat.” 

For everyone who’s read other 

stories about the insanity, or for 
anyone who lived it, I hope this is 
a nice reminder that even though 
CEOs can suck, somehow a bunch 
of artists with tons of passion got 
together and made something 
amazing. They’re the kinds of art-
ists who think about what kind of 
music 
basketball-playing 
robots 

would listen to, the kinds who care 
so much about their audiences that 
they take a problem that isn’t theirs 
to solve into their own hands. I saw 
and felt a lot of unforgettable things 
that weekend, so to the people I met, 
you know who you are. To the music 
I heard, know that I’ll never stop lis-
tening. To TomorrowWorld, rock 
the fuck on.

SERVICES

This summer, I devoted most 

of my daylight hours to helping 
women search for their perfect 
pair of jeans. After a meager 19 
years in the search, my seasonal 
employment 
at a local 
retailer helped 
me discover 
what may very 
well be my 
life’s purpose: 
assessing 
denim siz-
ing with the 
intention 
of boosting 
confidence 
levels. However, one fateful day, I 
just couldn’t help a bookish, petite 
brunette find her match.

After handing her a sizeable 

stack of various washes and fits, 
she emerged from the fitting room 
rocking a pair of Paige’s that fit 
her near perfectly; I felt as if my 
divine gift had been shared, yet 
again.

“These just don’t spark joy,” 

she said.

I didn’t understand — one, how 

a ridiculously flattering pair of 
jeans couldn’t bring joy to this 
woman, and two, what she meant 
by this “spark joy” nonsense. Was 
she an electrician-turned-yogi? I 
didn’t know.

In response to my puzzled 

countenance, she extolled the 
virtues of her fashion formula. 
She had recently finished author 
Marie Kondo’s “The Life Chang-
ing Magic of Tidying Up: The 
Japanese Art of Decluttering 
and Organizing.” In the self-help 
guide, Kondo explains her process 
of de-cluttering one’s life to be 
nothing more than keeping items 
that “spark joy” and ridding of 
anything that doesn’t. While I 
found the whole idea to be rather 
gimmicky and even more so in 
practice, I nevertheless resonated 
with bookish, petite brunette’s 
application of the maxim. I know 
when I like something or someone 
almost immediately. Clairvoy-
ant? Maybe. There’s an initial 
gravitation towards the articles of 
clothing, pieces of jewelry, beauty 
products, books and social net-

work platforms that I consistently 
use and seldom stray from. Maybe 
I’m awful and materialistic, but 
I swear, something sparks when 
I find something of upstanding 
superior quality — maybe it’s joy, 
maybe me and petite bookish bru-
nette are insane.

Inspired by petite, bookish 

brunette and Kondo, I cultivated 
a collection this summer that I’m 
likely to maintain throughout the 
fall — a set of inspirations that 
have manifested into my identity, 
or I suppose “spark joy” (am I 
doing this right, petite, bookish 
brunette?). My must-haves can 
conveniently be reduced to a list 
of ten — from icons to internet 
platforms, in no particular order, 
here’s what’s crucial right now:

1. Rompers
As I’ve stated before, the romp-

er is the most ingenious garment 
for plebeians and runway models, 
alike. It’s versatile, innovative, 
the love of my life and above all, 
always there when I can’t decide 
what to wear during this awful 
summer-to-fall transition.

2. Nameplate
Yes, nameplates have been pop-

ular for approximately two years 
and are verging on near-trendless. 
Then again, trends are a flop. 
I rock my gold-plated cursive-
inscribed epithet from Etsy on the 
daily. Bonus: it forces everyone 
you meet in class to never forget 
your name.

3. Rosewater toner
In theme of my general over-

dramatic praise of amazing beauty 
products, Thayer’s rosewater and 
witch hazel toner has changed my 
life for the better. Delicately scent-
ed and ridiculously low-priced ($8 
a bottle), it’s everything I’ve ever 
wanted in a facial clarifier.

4. LinkedIn Premium
This may seem like the outlier 

on the list, partially because it is. 
Get off Facebook, and start your 
free month of LinkedIn Premium 
ASAP. Your party pics may not be 
there, but professional connec-
tions await.

5. Espadrille Flats (seasonal)
Mid-July, I finally purchased 

a pair of faux-leather, espadrille 
slip-ons that I may or may not 

have taken off since. They’re 
unbelievably comfortable, incon-
ceivably chic and I always receive 
a compliment when I wear them.

6. Two types of mascara
For ultimate eyelash definition, 

I’ve been double-coating my lash-
es. A swoop of CoverGirl Lash-
Blast topped off with DiorShow is 
everything I need and more from 
that 8 a.m. discussion to 8 p.m. 
happy hour if I were of legal age.

7. Olivier Rousteing
I’m obsessed with the current 

creative director of Balmain. He’s 
real, he’s outrageously talented 
and he has a namesake army of 
models. Unfamiliar with Roust-
eig? Check out his intimate New 
Yorker profile, where he speaks 
from a point of hyper-awareness

8. Kerastase Hair Oil
Next to myself, there’s no one 

I trust more than my beloved 
hair stylist. She’s been keeping 
my coif utterly on fleek for almost 
five years, and when she recom-
mended I invest in Kerastase 
Elixir Ultime for the promised 
“princess hair,” I immediately fol-
lowed orders.

9. Joan Didion’s packing list
After devoting a summer to the 

works of Didion, I’ve found zero 
flaws in the enigmatic empresses 
of prose. I became even more 
enamored when I stumbled upon 
her essentials for a strategic suit-
case. Simple, honing Didion’s sig-
nature cool, and full of leotards, 
I’m now packed for a trip to Cali 
that I’ve yet to book.

10. Bralettes
In defense of the lazy garment, 

I present you the single-most 
important negligee of our leisure-
obsessed society. The bralette 
isn’t even a real bra, and it adds 
a delicate touch when peeping 
through a top (read: it’s more 
comfortable than swaddling 
yourself in cashmere and a frac-
tion of the cost, and it’s made of 
pretty lace).

Robinson impressing teammates

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Writer

Aubrey 
Dawkins 
once 

witnessed 
Duncan 
Robinson 

make 41 consecutive 3-pointers 
before he missed a basket. It was 
an eye-opening experience.

“Duncan can really shoot the 

ball, and I thought I could shoot,” 
Dawkins said Friday before the 
Wolverines’ first practice of the 
season. “I couldn’t match that.”

Robinson, a 6-foot-8 redshirt 

sophomore swingman, will be 
eligible this year after transferring 
from Williams College before last 
season and sitting out per NCAA 
transfer rules.

After averaging 17.1 points, 6.5 

rebounds and 34.7 minutes per 
game during his freshman year at 
the Division III level, he waited 
his turn and made some pretty 
considerable transformations.

Robinson weighed in at 185 

pounds at Williams, but just a year 
later, the guard built himself up to 
210 pounds for this season.

“All I know is Duncan can 

really shoot and really pass, and 
D.J. (Wilson) can really shoot, 
he can pass OK right now for a 
young guy,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein in a radio interview 
on WKTA. “The biggest issues 
for both of them are, ‘I used to 
be a string bean and people used 
to 
push 
me 

around and so 
I 
didn’t 
like 

physical 
play 

… well now I 
weigh 
20 
or 

30 
pounds 

more and have 
to learn how 
to 
embrace 

physical play.’ ”

Playing in Division I games 

will be reality soon enough, 
but in practice, Robinson has 
impressed everyone from Beilein 
to senior captain Spike Albrecht 
to former Wolverine and current 
Philidelphia 76ers guard Nik 

Stauskas.

“We 
need 
to 
schedule 

something,” Stauskas told the 

Daily 
this 

summer. 
“(Robinson) 
might 
even 

beat me — at 
least 
that’s 

what the guys 
have 
been 

telling me.”

Albrecht, 

who, 
like 

Stauskas, is famous in his own 
right for sinking unorthodox 
3-pointers, spent time in the gym 
with Robinson and can attest to 
his teammate’s talent. Though the 
Wolverines don’t plan on living 
and dying by the 3, Michigan 

will undoubtedly have plenty of 
options beyond the arc.

“Dunc’s just gonna be another 

weapon for us out there, especially 
offensively,” Albrecht said. “He 
has versatility. He’s long. He’s got 
length. He can obviously shoot 
the ball, everyone knows that. 
He’s a really high-IQ basketball 
player, so we’re looking forward 
to getting him out on the court 
with us.”

But with a roster that showcases 

plenty 
of 
guards, 
including 

senior 
Caris 
LeVert, 
junior 

Derrick Walton Jr., Albrecht 
and 
sophomore 
classmates 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
and Dawkins, the competition 
for playing time will be fierce. 
Minutes will be hard to come by, 

but Robinson has been nothing 
short of impressive.

During the Wolverines’ open 

practice on Friday, Robinson 
drained unopposed shots from 
all over the floor with ease. 
That could always change in 
live game action, but that isn’t 
something Robinson’s teammates 
are concerned about right now. 
They’ve seen his ability and don’t 
think it will stop.

“We got some new weapons 

and some guys who add some 
stuff to our offense, so this year 
will be really exciting for us,” 
Walton said. “Aubrey and Caris 
can shoot, but Duncan is different 
— real different.

“You almost get confused when 

he misses.”

Goalie Catt not a 
typical freshman

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Editor

For most freshmen, the start 

of college can be a phase when 
they might not know anyone 
at the University. The overall 
adjustment takes some time.

For most freshman athletes, 

joining a new team takes some 
adjustment as well.

But 
for 
Chad 
Catt, 
the 

Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 

freshman goaltender, the story is 
a little different. For one, he is 21 
years old and hasn’t taken a class 
in two and a half years.

“I’m 
the 
oldest 
possible 

freshman,” Catt joked.

But that’s not all. Catt is also 

familiar with much of the team, 
having played with many of his 
new teammates at various levels 
of junior hockey. In 2009, Catt 
played with former Wolverine 
Andrew 
Copp 
and 
junior 

forward Max Shuart, and they 
won a national championship 
with Detroit Compuware.

As Catt grew older, he ran into 

more current Michigan players, 
especially at Victory Honda U-18, 
where he teamed up with five 
current Wolverines including 
Shuart, 
sophomore 
forwards 

Alex Talcott, Niko Porikos and 
Tony Calderone and sophomore 
defenseman Cutler Martin.

Catt’s familiarity with most of 

the team also provides him with 
many resources who have gone 
through his current transition, 
which has made it easier for Catt 
to find his way at Michigan.

“The guys told me everything 

from just moving into the dorms, 
to knowing where classes are 
and to knowing how practices 
are organized,” Catt said. “It was 
nice to be able to talk to the guys 
over the summer. I came here for 
a couple skates over the summer, 

too, so that was nice to see the 
guys.”

But one of the most important 

junior hockey connections Catt 
has is with his goaltending 
counterpart, junior netminder 
Zach Nagelvoort. The two played 
together for a short period of 
time for the Aberdeen Wings, a 
Tier II junior hockey team that 
plays in the North American 
Hockey League. However, their 
ties go back even further than 
their days at Aberdeen.

“We grew up facing each other 

in Detroit,” Nagelvoort said. “I 
don’t think we ever played with 
each other in youth hockey, but 
we knew each other well as the 
guy on the other side of the ice.

“I knew he was coming from 

the USHL, so when I got traded 
(to Aberdeen) I had heard that 
Chad might be there, so that 
would be kind of interesting.”

For the two goaltenders, the 

prior connection has helped 
them gel a lot faster than most 
veterans and freshman, and it 
has helped the two get straight 
to 
business 
instead 
of 
the 

formalities that come with a new 
season.

“We had a good relationship 

at Aberdeen,” Nagelvoort said. 
“I think I played three or four 
more games than him there, but 
it was a pretty good working 
relationship. I got to jump right 
past that because I know Chad 
really well, and I knew what kind 
of kid he was and that coming 
in he was going to work his bag 
off and push me everyday, so I’d 
have to do the same.”

While Catt may be older 

than 
the 
majority 
of 
the 

undergraduate 
population 
at 

Michigan, his time in Ann Arbor 
is just starting. With a plethora 
of old teammates here, he isn’t 
just any old freshman.

ICE HOCKEY

Swenson builds off of 
strong start to season

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

Sam Swenson didn’t take 

much time to earn the starting 
goalkeeper 
position 
for 
the 

Michigan field hockey team.

As 
a 
freshman, 
Swenson 

appeared in all 20 games for 
the Wolverines, starting 18 and 
posting 
a 
1.34 
goals-against 

average.

The 
native 
of 
Harrogate, 

England, has continued her good 
form into her sophomore season. 
Through 
12 
games 
Swenson 

has improved her goals against 
average to .94 and carries a .796 
save percentage into this Friday’s 
game against No. 20 Iowa.

“I think my decision making 

has 
improved 
the 
most,” 

Swenson said. “I’m getting a 
lot better at knowing where I 
should be on the field, and the 
decisions I need to make as a 
play is progressing. I also feel 
more confident in my skills. I 
feel like that’s an aspect that 
has improved, that my actual 
skills have gotten better and I 
can execute once I’ve made the 
decisions out there.”

Her coach, Marcia Pankratz, 

has counted on her from day one.

“I think coming into the 

University of Michigan as a 
freshman, not only for the 
American kids but certainly 
someone who’s coming all the 
way across the ocean to a new 
culture, it’s a big adjustment,” 
Pankratz said. “I think coming 
into her sophomore year, she 
knows what it’s all about.”

Though 
she 
is 
just 
a 

sophomore, 
Swenson 
brings 

plenty of experience, having 
captained her prep team in 
England 
for 
five 
seasons. 

Swenson’s play has been strong 
enough this year to earn two 
Big Ten Defensive Player of 
the Week honors. She has also 
been a part of four shutout 
performances by the Michigan 
defense while allowing just 11 

goals all season.

“It’s 
really 
nice 
to 
be 

recognized,” Swenson said. “As 
a defensive player it is something 
really 
special. 
Sometimes 

goalkeeper is not as rewarding as 
other positions on the field, so it is 
really nice to be recognized, but 
I couldn’t do it without the rest 
of my team. They really do push 
me in the right way every day in 
practice and in every game, so 
it’s really all down to them for 
making me who I am today.”

Swenson has been able to learn 

on the job while benefitting from 
the support of an experienced 
Wolverine back line, but when 
the time comes, she has been 
in position to defend her net. 
The team, in turn, has taken 
advantage of having a goalie 
as good as Swenson, taking 
risks further up the field that it 
wouldn’t normally. They trust 
her to come up with the saves.

Early in the season, Swenson 

and 
the 
defense 
struggled 

defending penalty corners but 
Swenson has stepped up into 
a leadership role in penalty 
situations. Part of the leadership 
process for Swenson has been 
studying plenty of film prior to 
games.

“She’s making the big-time 

saves,” Pankratz said. “She did 
last year as well, but even more 
this year. When the game has 
been tight and close, she’s been 
coming up with a couple of 
really big saves that have kept 
us in the game and have allowed 
our attack to then score in the 
second half to win it.”

Swenson continues to grow 

and develop as a leader on the 
defense, just as the competition 
will toughen on the way to the 
Big Ten Tournament. But in her 
second year at Michigan, it’s safe 
to say she’s right at home.

Sophomore forward Taylor Timko and Michigan scored a key Big Ten win over the Wildcats on Thursday night.
‘M’ dominates Northwestern

By ORION SANG

For the Daily

Thursday night, the Michigan 

women’s soccer team beat No. 22 
Northwestern in a 1-0 game that 
was 
not 

nearly 
as 

close as the 
score indicated.

The game’s lone goal came in 

the 34th minute, when senior 
midfielder Corinne Harris fired 
a shot from 25 yards out to 
provide the Wolverines with the 
only tally they needed.

Michigan (4-1-1 Big Ten, 9-4-1 

overall) dominated play and 
possession with a high-powered 
offense that generated 18 total 
shots compared to seven from 
the Wildcats (3-2-1, 9-3-2).

“There 
was 
never 
any 

question who the better team 
was today,” said Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan. “I thought from the 
first whistle to the last we were 
aggressively attacking.”

The Wolverines got off to a 

quick offensive start, with junior 
forward Nicky Waldeck creating 
an early scoring opportunity a 
minute and a half into the game. 
It was one of many opportunities 
Michigan had on the day.

On 
the 
other 
side, 

Northwestern was unable to 
establish a consistent attack. 

Michigan’s 
defense 
stifled 

the 
Wildcats, 
successfully 

challenging balls in the midfield 
to prevent Northwestern from 
possessing it in the Wolverines’ 
half.

“Our defensive organization 

was fantastic,” Ryan said.

Leading the charge from the 

midfield was Harris, who was 
splendid on both offense and 
defense.

“We 
had 
two 
center 

midfielders 
playing 
against three 
of them,” Ryan 
said, 
“and 

Corinne 
still 

dominates 
in 

that situation 
and finds the 
winning goal.”

With 
11 

minutes left in 
the first half, 
Harris had perhaps her finest 
moment.

Set up by a touch pass from 

freshman forward Reilly Martin, 
Harris took two dribbles before 
unleashing a shot into the upper 
right corner of the net.

“As we get closer to the end of 

the season, the upperclassmen 
who have experience have been 
trying to step up more and make 
a difference in the games,” 

Harris said.

Michigan took the one-goal 

lead into half and would not give 
it up. The Wolverines continued 
their offensive onslaught after 
the break, equaling their shot 
output from the first half. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Taylor 

Timko and redshirt sophomore 
forward Ani Sarkisian both 
had late chances to extend 
Michigan’s lead, but neither was 
able to convert.

It was an 

important 
win 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
who were in 
a 
four-way 

tie for second 
place in the Big 
Ten 
heading 

into the game.

With 
just 

five games left 
before the Big 

Ten 
conference 
tournament, 

Ryan feels good about where the 
Wolverines stand.

“I feel like this is one of the 

best teams I’ve ever coached at 
Michigan,” Ryan said. “They 
needed tonight’s win against a 
top-ranked team so they have 
confidence. We face several of 
those teams over the next few 
weeks, so we need to roll up our 
sleeves and go after them.”

Jim Harbaugh has said that to win on the road, you’d better pack 
your defense. This Saturday at Michigan Stadium, both teams 
will pack their defenses. The top two units in the country in 
points allowed match up on Homecoming at the Big House. The 
Wolverines will face their highest-ranked opponent of the season 
before a home tilt against Michigan State next weekend.

Expect a low-scoring affair between two

Utah (Sept. 3): Well, at least the mountains 
were cool?

Oregon State (Sept. 12): Imagine how Jim 
Harbaugh would have freaked out if Michigan 
lost.

Michigan State (Oct. 17): These teams play a 
week earlier than last year, which Mark Danto-
nio will take as a sign of blatant disrespect.

Minnesota (Oct. 31): Plot twist: Michigan plays 
Minnesota for the Little Orange Pumpkin.

Rutgers (Nov. 7): Will Michigan fans storm the 
field if the Wolverines avenge last year’s loss in 
Piscataway? We hope not.

UNLV (Sept. 19): More like Loss Vegas.

Indiana (Nov. 14): Boring state. Hopefully not a 
boring game.

BYU (Sept. 26): The Mormons left Ann Arbor 
with more wives than points.

Maryland (Oct. 3): The Terrapins turtled at 
Michigan’s stingy defense.

Northwestern (Oct. 10): Are you ready for 
M00N pt. 2: N00M?

Ohio State (Nov. 28): We wanted to make a 
joke, but the only one we could think of was, 
“Haha, your backup QB might win the Heisman.”

Penn State (Nov. 21): Christian Hackenberg 
could be a first-round pi — aaand, he just got

Tinder 
Matches


By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

In recent weeks, attempting 

to score against the Michigan 
football team’s defense has been 
an exercise in 
futility. 
The 

Wolverines 
have 
mauled 

opposing 
offenses 
into 

submission, 
drive 
after 

drive.

Michigan’s 

four 
consecutive 
victories 
have 

been 
buoyed 

by its defense. 
The Wolverines 
(1-0 Big Ten, 4-1 
overall) have posted consecutive 
shutouts and allowed just one 
touchdown apiece to UNLV and 
Oregon State in the two games 
before that.

But this weekend, Michigan’s 

defense could meet its match. 
The Wolverines are currently 
the second-ranked team in the 
nation in total defense, allowing 
184 yards per game — one of just 
two teams in the country allowing 
fewer than 200.

One 
of 
the 
teams 
a 
few 

spots 
behind 
the 
Wolverines 

is 
Saturday’s 
opponent, 

Northwestern 
(1-0, 
5-0). 
The 

Wildcats have allowed 247.4 yards 
per game, good for fifth in the 
country.

Looking at scoring defense 

yields 
similar 
results. 

Northwestern is No. 1 in the 
country in that statistic, allowing 
seven points per game. Michigan 
is No. 2 in the nation at 7.6.

The inclination based off these 

statistics is that Saturday’s game 
will largely be a defensive struggle. 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
is not entirely convinced that a 
matchup of two of the nation’s 
best defenses is relevant.

“The two defenses won’t go 

against each other,” Harbaugh 
said Monday. “They won’t face 
each other, so look at it the way 
you always look at it: It’s three 
phases, and you want to win each 
of those phases.”

Statistically, the teams are also 

similar on the offensive side of the 
ball. The Wolverines rank 77th 
nationally in total offense, while 
the Wildcats are 79th.

But because the calling card of 

both teams is defense, that phase 
of the game will be most tightly 
scrutinized Saturday. Michigan’s 
defensive players have not been 
afraid to vocalize their high goals 
for the unit.

“I think our goal is to be the 

best defense in the country,” said 
redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Ryan Glasgow. “We don’t really 
shy away from 
talk about that, 
but the main key 
that is stressed 
every week is 
you 
have 
to 

remember what 
got you here.”

Michigan 

defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. Durkin was not quite that 
bold when he met with the 
media Wednesday, but he, too, 
is satisfied by what he has seen 
from his unit.

One of Durkin’s mantras has 

been to tell players to “stamp 
their personalities” on their role, 
meaning he wants them play with 
their own style and substance 
rather than act like “robots.”

Durkin even applies that same 

standard to himself, by frequently 
being a hands-on coach and 
jumping into drills to demonstrate 
instead of standing back and 

watching. He is not concerned 
about any laziness that could 
result from overconfidence after 
two straight shutouts.

“It’s about how hard you work 

and how you prepare. And our 
guys, we’re obviously talking 
about that a bunch,” Durkin 
said. “I think they’re starting to 
understand that. That’s who we 
want to be: a blue-collar team.”

Saturday, 

Michigan 
will 

face 
another 

team that could 
consider 
itself 

blue-collar, 
a 

foe with similar 
strengths to the 
Wolverines’. 
Michigan 
has 

had 
success 

against 
spread 
offenses 
like 

the Wildcats’ this year, despite 
struggling 
against 
similar 

offenses 
in 
recent 
memory. 

The Wolverines did not allow a 
score after the game’s opening 
moments against Oregon State, 
another opponent that ran a 
spread offense.

Similar 
results 
would 
bode 

well for Michigan this weekend. 
As much as Harbaugh wants his 
team to focus on all three phases 
of the game, all eyes will be on the 
defensive side of the ball, no matter 
whose offense is on the field.

All eyes on defense Saturday

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Michigan defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin (bottom) has led one of the nation’s 
best defenses, anchored by a stout defensive front (top).

“That’s who we 

want to be: a blue-

collar team.”


In 
January, 
Harbaugh 
hired 

another 
familiar 
face 
to 
coach 

the tight ends — his son, Jay. An 
offensive assistant for his uncle John 
in Baltimore for the previous three 
years, Jay has emulated his father’s 
NFL tendencies.

“You certainly watch, and you 

tend to know who does what well,” 
Jay Harbaugh said. “Some teams are 
better with tight ends than others. 
Some teams do really good stuff with 
backs out of the backfield, so if you’re 
looking for a certain idea, you know 
which teams to look at, whether 
it’s third down or red zone. There’s 
certainly some of that.

“We’re open to getting ideas from 

anywhere.”

The increased focus on tight ends 

has put Butt in the spotlight. In five 
games, he has 19 catches for 234 
yards — both second on the team — 
and a touchdown.

Other stats tell 

even more about 
Michigan’s 
new 

approach: Butt has 
been targeted 5.8 
times 
per 
game 

this season, which 
ranks 10th in the 
country and first 
in the Big Ten among tight ends, 
according to rotogrinders.com. He 
has also taken 19.08 percent of the 
receiving workload, sixth in the 
country, and his eight catches in the 
season opener at Utah were the most 
by a Michigan tight end since 1995.

Those 
numbers 
give 
the 

Harbaughs, father and son, reason to 
believe in their scheme.

“I think that from the get-go 

(the tight ends) were really, really 
excited to be a part of this team, and 
I think it’s obvious why, with the 
opportunities in terms of playing 
time,” Jay Harbaugh said. “And 
the diversity of assignments and 
responsibility is kind of unparalleled 
at this level. No matter what anybody 
says, it’s really not close in terms of 
what we ask them to do.”

* * *

It’s one thing to focus on the pro 

style, but to execute it, a team has to 
have the players and the coaches, 
but it also has to watch the film — 
which Michigan does, at length. 
The Wolverines have spoken about 
watching tape from different sources, 
even high-school games, to gain ideas.

“Shoot, I’ve watched a lot of 

everybody,” 
Jay 
Harbaugh 
said. 

“The (Kansas City) Chiefs have done 
some nice stuff recently. I would say 
probably them the last couple weeks. 
They’ve done some pretty good stuff. 
(The Carolina) Panthers as well, and 
then the (New England) Patriots are 

always good.”

If 
that’s 
where 
Harbaugh’s 

focus lies, then Michigan’s tight 
ends coach’s intentions are in 
the right place. The Patriots’ Rob 
Gronkowski, the Panthers’ Greg 
Olsen and the Chiefs’ Travis Kelce 
rank first, second and eighth, 
respectively, among NFL tight 
ends in targets per game. If the 
Wolverines’ trends continue, their 
tight ends could soon be in similar 
positions.

Michigan 
also 
takes 
ideas 

from 
other 
college 
teams 
— 

when it watched West Virginia 
and Maryland play to scout the 
Terrapins, for instance. But the 
Wolverines are so similar to 
some NFL teams and so different 
from some college teams that 
sometimes, it doesn’t make as 
much sense.

“I think our 

offense 
lends 

itself to looking 
at 
NFL 
tape 

more than other 
colleges,” 
Jay 

Harbaugh said. 
“Probably 
just 

because it makes 
more 
sense 

for us to, because there’s more 
carryover in terms of protections 
and formations.”

The 
other 
positions 
have 

pro applications as well. The 
defense uses multiple formations, 
frequently rotating between the 
3-4 and the 4-3. There, Dierdorf 
sees shades of the NFL.

Fifth-year senior Jake Rudock, 

a graduate transfer from Iowa, 
where he started for two years, also 
has a big responsibility. Michigan 
sends multiple plays in from the 
sideline, forcing Rudock to call one 
at the line.

“You go to the line and everyone 

on offense is prepared to run 
one of several different plays,” 
Dierdorf said. “It requires a lot of 
coordination, a lot of smart people 
listening and anticipating what 
they’re going to hear from the 
quarterback in terms of what play 
they’re going to run.”

Whatever the most important 

factor may be, the NFL focus has 
put the Wolverines in a position 
to contend for the Big Ten title in 
a year no one thought they could.

If 
Michigan 
hoped 
NFL 

concepts would help give the team 
a leg up on the competition, that’s 
just what they have done.

Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh and one of his 

many football influences watched 
from the sideline during Michigan’s 
game at Maryland on Saturday. Over 
the past nine months, Harbaugh 
has alluded to countless people who 
have helped him become Michigan’s 
head coach — just as many on the 
field as off of it.

Last week, he didn’t have to go 

far to get an outside perspective 
on his team’s 28-0 thrashing of the 
Terrapins. His brother, John — the 
head coach of the NFL’s Baltimore 
Ravens — stood beside him at 
various points during the game.

Harbaugh has drawn from many 

people in his transformation of 
Michigan football from a 5-7 team 
that missed the postseason to a 4-1 
power that ranks No. 2 in the nation 
in scoring defense.

Two 
weeks 
ago, 
after 
the 

Wolverines 
romped 
to 
a 
31-0 

victory 
over 
Brigham 
Young, 

Harbaugh admitted he borrowed 
a play John’s Ravens ran the week 
before for a touchdown. Against 
Maryland, redshirt junior wide 
receiver Jehu Chesson broke loose 
for a 66-yard touchdown run, and 
John Harbaugh said that play came 
from the Ravens, too.

Five weeks in, on a Michigan 

team 
with 
eight 
former 
NFL 

coaches, the league has made a 

sizable impact.

“I don’t know the percentage, 

but it has,” Harbaugh said Monday. 
“It’s there. … (I) enjoy watching it 
as a coach. You don’t feel like it’s 
stealing. It’s research. But yeah, 
there are a lot of good ideas that 
come from high school coaches, 
college coaches, pro coaches.”

Between coaches, schemes and 

formations, Michigan is starting to 
look more like a professional team. 
The eight former pro coaches have 
worked for a total of eight different 
teams. Harbaugh takes a screen 
pass from here and an end-around 
run from there until he has a viable 
approach.

“I think our offense is a little more 

of an NFL-style offense scheme-
wise,” said sophomore offensive 
tackle Mason Cole. “Besides that, 
getting coached by NFL coaches, 
they’ve all been there. Just learning 
from those guys is an incredible 
experience.”

In little time, the Wolverines 

have 
entirely 
changed 
their 

appearance. And there’s still a lot 
more to come.

* * *

After 
Harbaugh 
took 
the 

Michigan job in late December, 
he didn’t waste time installing his 
vision. He didn’t wait for his first 
recruiting class to reshape the roster 
the way he wanted it. At Stanford 

and with the San Francisco 49ers, 
his team was loaded with fullbacks 
and tight ends for his power 
running scheme. This year, the 
Wolverines have seven fullbacks (if 
you count fullback-tight end hybrid 
Henry Poggi), more than double the 
three they had last year.

Fifth-year senior Joe Kerridge, 

redshirt junior Bobby Henderson 
and senior Sione Houma returned. 
Nick 
Volk 
converted 
from 

linebacker, Poggi from defensive 
end. Sophomores Joe Beneducci 
and Deyanco Hardwick joined the 
team.

Several 
times 
this 
season, 

Michigan has lined up in tight sets 
with three men in the backfield, 
a somewhat rare formation, even 
in the NFL. Harbaugh’s influence 
created that opportunity.

It came straight from the NFL, 

too, because power fullbacks are 
a dying breed in college football. 
While the Wolverines have seven 
on their roster, 12 teams in the top-
25 poll have zero. Just five other 
teams have three or more.

“I think it’s just a different style 

of football,” Cole said. “You don’t see 
that a lot in college football anymore. 
I think it’s good.”

One of the five fullback-heavy 

teams is Stanford, which Harbaugh 
built in a mold similar to the one 
he has started with Michigan. In 
between, he picked up tools in the 
NFL. When he reached the NFC 
Championship Game in each of his 
first three seasons in San Francisco, 
tight end Vernon Davis was in the 
top two on the team in receiving 

yards and touchdowns each year.

Dan Dierdorf, who now serves 

as the radio color commentator 
for Michigan football, was an All-
American offensive lineman under 
Bo Schembechler from 1967 to 1970 
and then a Hall of Famer for the 
St. Louis Rams from 1971 to 1983. 
He sees the similarities between 
Michigan’s style and a pro style from 
the broadcast booth.

“(Harbaugh) played quarterback 

his entire life. He coaches like 
he plays linebacker or he plays 
offensive guard,” Dierdorf said. 
“He coaches knowing the value 
of winning the battle at the line of 
scrimmage.”

Before he coached in the pros, 

Harbaugh developed future pro 
tight ends in Coby Fleener and Zach 
Ertz at Stanford, and he’s on his 
way to doing the same at Michigan. 
The day before fall camp started, he 
called junior tight end Jake Butt one 
of the best NFL tight end prospects 
he has ever coached.

Under Harbaugh, the Wolverines 

have eight tight ends (plus Poggi), 
up from six last year, but their 
development has allowed them 
to use three on the field at once. 
In the top 25, only Alabama and 
Mississippi possess more tight ends 
than Michigan.

Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Northwestern

Average offenses 

may struggle against 

stingy defenses

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Riding two straight shutouts, 

the Michigan football team is on 
a roll. No. 13 Northwestern comes 
to Ann Arbor this week, though, 
and it might take a third straight 
shutout to beat the Wildcats.

Northwestern 
and 
the 

18th-ranked Wolverines (1-0 Big 
Ten, 4-1 overall) boast the top two 
defenses in the Big Ten and two 
of the best in the nation. While 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
pointed out that the defenses 
won’t go head-to-head, all eyes 
will be on that side of the ball 
Saturday.

The 
Daily 
broke 
down 

Michigan’s 
upcoming 
meeting 

with the Wildcats.

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Northwestern pass defense

The Wildcats should pose a 

difficult test for fifth-year senior 
Jake Rudock’s game-managing 
abilities. Rudock has been about 
average in his first five games as 
a Wolverine, turning the ball over 
a little too much but generally 
holding the offense steady against 
subpar defenses.

The only time Rudock has 

faced a defense comparable to 
Northwestern’s 
was 
against 

Utah in the season opener, when 
he threw three interceptions, 
including a pick-six.

Against 
the 
Wildcats’ 
stiff 

rush defense, Rudock will likely 
have to throw more than in past 
games, meaning accuracy will 
be at a premium. He is currently 
completing 60 percent of his 
passes but has not yet needed to be 
the focal point of the offense. He 
may need to be on Saturday.

Some 
miscues 
have 
been 

surmountable against teams like 
Oregon State and Maryland, but 
against Northwestern, he’ll need 
to avoid mistakes at all costs. The 
Wildcats boast the No. 7 pass 
defense in the country, giving up 
just 130 yards per game, and held 
Stanford to just two field goals in 
Week 1.

All the Cardinal have done 

since is hang 41 on Southern 
California, 42 on Oregon State and 

55 on Arizona.

Northwestern 
is 
the 
best 

defense Rudock has faced all 
season, and unless he makes a 
large leap in a hurry, it doesn’t 
look like a good matchup for the 
Wolverines.

Edge: Northwestern

Michigan 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Northwestern rush defense

This pairing should be closer, 

and it will also be the centerpiece 
of the game. Michigan wants to 
pound the ball. Northwestern 
wants to stuff the run. It’s a match 
made in power-ball heaven.

The Wolverines are averaging 

201 yards per game, but they face 
a more-than-worthy opponent in 
the Wildcats’ 26th-ranked rush 
defense.

One key factor will be the 

status of junior running back 
De’Veon Smith, who missed the 
Maryland game with an ankle 
injury. If Smith is at full strength, 
his tackle-breaking abilities are 
of paramount importance against 
the stingy Northwestern line. If he 
can’t play, or is limited, look to see 
redshirt junior Drake Johnson, 
who isn’t the bruising type of back 
Harbaugh prefers to use.

Johnson spreads the field more 

with his agility and pass-catching 
abilities, but he’s also easier to 
tackle than Smith if you can catch 
up to him.

In either case, the Wildcats 

will be ready and willing to face 
the run. Don’t expect Michigan to 
abandon its power style unless it 
trails late, though, no matter how 
much gridlock its running backs 
face.

Edge: Northwestern

Northwestern pass offense vs. 
Michigan pass defense

According to the rankings, 

the Wolverines have the No. 3 
pass defense in the country. But 
don’t tell that to the Michigan 
secondary, which believes it can 
be the nation’s best.

Currently, 
opponents 
are 

averaging just 112.6 yards per 
game through the air, and the 
Wolverines have held their last 
two opponents well under 100 
passing yards.

Junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis 
has 
broken 
up 
seven 

passes this season and has been 

a shutdown corner in every sense 
of the word. He intercepted 
his first pass of the season last 
week, and against the Wildcats’ 
inexperienced 
quarterback 

Clayton Thorson, Lewis and the 
secondary will be salivating for 
more.

Thorson has gone over 152 

yards in just one game this season, 
and three of his four touchdown 
passes came against Ball State. 
He does, however, have four 
more touchdowns on the ground, 
meaning Michigan will need to 
contain him throughout the game.

If the Wolverines can force 

Thorson to throw, the secondary 
is more than capable of winning 
the air battle.

Edge: Michigan

Northwestern rush offense vs. 
Michigan rush defense

So far, only Utah has given 

Michigan any trouble on the 
ground. 
Travis 
Wilson 
and 

Devontae Booker rang up 120 
rushing yards on the Wolverines 
in the first game of the season, 
and the Wolverines have been 
sturdy since, holding every other 
opponent under 100 yards.

The defense took a hit when 

Mario Ojemudia was lost for 
the season with an Achilles 
injury 
against 
the 
Terrapins, 

but otherwise, this is one of the 
scariest units in the country.

Between 
redshirt 
junior 

defensive ends Chris Wormley 
and Willie Henry, and redshirt 
sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Maurice Hurst, Michigan has 
enough weapons to be fresh all 
game. For the Wildcats, that 
should be a scary thought.

Through 
five 
games, 
the 

Wolverines have 40 tackles for 
loss, totaling 149 yards. If that 
keeps up, it will be tough for 
Northwestern to sustain any kind 
of drive.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Now that we have the defensive 

dominance out of the way, it’s 
time for the matchup that very 
well could determine the game. 
It would hardly surprise anyone 
if this turned into a battle of field 
position, with both sides trading 
punts and collecting field goals.

If it devolves into that, fifth-

year senior punter Blake O’Neill 
gives the Wolverines a key weapon 
in the punting game. O’Neill 
has booted punts as long as 59 
yards this year and is averaging 
a respectable 40.7 yards. He has 
pinned opponents inside their own 
20-yard line 11 times already, and 
in a game that may be decided by 

inches, that could prove decisive.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Jabrill 

Peppers has also come close to 
breaking loose on a couple of 
punts this season, so expect the 
Wildcats to be well prepared for 
him.

Northwestern’s Solomon Vault 

returned a kick 98 yards for a 
touchdown against Duke and is 
averaging 31.6 yards per return.

As for the placekickers, the 

Wildcats’ Jack Mitchell is 10-for-
12 on the season with a long of 49, 
while Michigan’s Kenny Allen is 
6-for-8 with a long of 40.

Edge: Northwestern

Intangibles

Even in just the second week of 

Big Ten play, there’s plenty on the 
line for these teams on Saturday. 
Michigan has seen a drastic rise in 
its stock over the last two weeks, 
and a win would only further that.

But if the Wolverines get caught 

looking ahead to No. 4 Michigan 
State next week, Northwestern 
will be ready to pounce. The 
Wildcats 
have 
had 
an 
edge 

this season, and three straight 
overtime losses at the Wolverines’ 
hands will fuel their motivation.

Edge: Northwestern

Pick: Michigan 13, Northwestern 9

Behind Enemy Lines: Christian Jones

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

In 
the 
Michigan 
football 

team’s 
ugly 
10-9 
win 
over 

Northwestern on Nov. 8, 2014, 
Wildcats wide receiver Christian 
Jones remembers cringing on the 
sideline. On the bench with a knee 
inury, Jones was forced to sit out 
all of Northwestern’s 2014 season, 
in which it went 5-7. Even after 
rehab, Jones was sidelined even 
longer because of a second knee 
surgery.

This fall, Jones has seen several 

first-year players rise to help lead 
the now 13th-ranked Wildcats. No. 
18 Michigan hosts Northwestern, 
also a resurgent program, on 
Saturday 
anticipating 
another 

close — though likely less sloppy 
— battle.

Jones sat down with the Daily 

at Big Ten Media Days in August 
to discuss rehab, a new offense, 
playing with a chip on his shoulder 
and sloppy competitions against 
Michigan in the past.

The Michigan Daily: Has your 

role changed since you were last 
a part of the 
offense?

Christian 

Jones: 
Possibly, 
but I’m here 
to help the 
team however I can. Ideally, I 
never want to step off that field 
and want to be a part of every play 
and every game, but I know that 
can change, and I’m OK with that 
if it helps the team win. I want to 
do whatever I can to help. That 
might be extra reps, that might 
be more time on the bench — 
whatever it is, I’m ready.

TMD: How did the team 

approach the summer after such 
a disappointing season? How did 
you help lead the team while still 
rehabbing for a second time?

CJ: Lots of tape. Our coach 

came to us all and told us our team 
needs to better, and he wants us 
to do better by having a better 
culture and have more of a sense 
of accountability, and a lot of that 
came from watching tape and 
seeing where we can improve. 
I was there to help with that. 
Whatever I did to get myself back 
I did on the side, but I was there to 
get the team back to the standard 
we wanted to be at.

TMD: 
You 
have 
a 
new 

quarterback this season. As a 

receiver, what traits are you 
looking for in your quarterback?

CJ: When I think of the best 

quarterbacks I’ve had, confidence 
is a must, but you can’t be so 
confident that you know your 
pass was right and (the receivers) 
messed it up. You have to be 
humble enough to ask questions, 
‘How do you want this throw? 
Where do you want me to hit you?’ 
And I think a quarterback that 
constantly wants to learn from 
his receivers and his running 
backs and his offensive linemen is 
constantly getting better.

TMD: To those who haven’t 

seen (freshman running back) 
Justin Jackson, how would you 

describe his play?

CJ: Interesting. He’s very fun 

to 
watch. 

Every 
time 

I watch him 
he’s 
bouncing 

off 
tackles, 

cutting, making 
people 
miss 

— 
it’s 
pretty 

cool. I watched 
a 
three-yard 

gain by him in 
practice, 
and 

he 
was 
just 

weaving through, bouncing off 
people just to get those three yards. 
It was amazing to see.

TMD: A team like Northwestern 

doesn’t get many high-profile 
recruits. How do you make up for 

it against higher-
profile teams?

CJ: We have 

a chip on our 
shoulder. 
We 

understand that 
we’ve got to be 
a lot more gritty 
and we’ve got to 
work harder than 
these other guys 
and we have to 
have fight — we 

have to fight a lot more than the 
other teams to make up for it.

TMD: 
Michigan 
and 

Northwestern have played in 

some close, but ugly, games as of 
late. What’s the mentality like in 
that matchup? Would you call it a 
rivalry?

CJ: I’m not sure if it’s a rivalry, 

but it’s definitely a game we have 
circled on our calendar, especially 
the offensive guys because we 
haven’t done our jobs in the past 
two games. I remember cringing 
looking at the film this summer. It 
was one of our worst games both 
seasons as a unit. But it’s a ton of 
fun going up against Michigan. 
They bring a lot of excitement to 
our games and have a similar style 
of play to us. Now that they have 
(Jim Harbaugh), we’re that much 
more excited to battle them.

What to Watch: ‘M’ seeks to 
replace Ojemudia on defense

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Both the No. 18 Michigan 

football 
team 
and 
No. 
13 

Northwestern enter Saturday’s 
matchup with plenty to smile 
about. The Wildcats (1-0 Big Ten, 
5-0 overall) have already matched 
their 2014 win total, and the 
Wolverines (1-0, 4-1) can do the 
same with a win Saturday.

Still, with impressive defenses, 

struggling offenses and a small 
sample size of ability, plenty of 
questions remain in the matchup. 
The Daily breaks down what to 
watch for Saturday.

1. Will anyone score?

It’s 
statistically 
impossible 

for a game to finish without a 
score under today’s format, and 
Michigan hasn’t played such a 
game since 1938, but the sentiment 
is there. The two teams are the best 
in the nation in scoring defense — 
Northwestern is first, allowing 
seven points per game, and the 
Wolverines are right behind at 
7.6. With plenty of returning 
contributors on defense and two 
hard-nosed coaches leading from 
the sidelines, both teams have 
the ability to shut down the most 
prolific offenses.

They won’t have to on Saturday, 

though, as neither team has an 
offense to match their ‘D.’ Both 
teams have first-year quarterbacks 
— graduate transfer Jake Rudock 
for Michigan and freshman Clayton 
Thorson for the Wildcats — and 
have depended on their rushing 
attacks to score. Even then, the 
Wolverines are just 74th in the 
nation with 27.8 points per game, 
and Northwestern is 89th with 
25.4. With the bulk of those points 
coming 
against 
mid-major 
or 

weaker teams, don’t expect these 
teams to surpass the game’s over/
under, set at 35 combined points.

2. Can Rudock replicate last 
year’s rampage?

Though Rudock hasn’t put up 

dazzling numbers as a Wolverine, 
he has against Northwestern. In 
Iowa’s 48-7 win over the Wildcats 

last fall, Rudock averaged 19.9 
yards per completion for 239 yards 
before being pulled in the second 
half.

Expect plenty of action for 

Michigan’s four running backs 
Saturday, but don’t be surprised 
if Rudock — still learning much of 
the playbook after missing spring 
practices — airs it out Saturday. 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said in a radio interview Thursday 
that Wednesday was Rudock’s 
best practice to date, and as his 
relationship with receivers grows, 
so does his potential for big plays.

3. Who levels up with Mario gone?

Senior 
linebacker 
Mario 

Ojemudia — who had been playing 
more like Bowser before injuring 
his Achilles on Saturday against 
Maryland — is one of the only 
major 
injuries 
Michigan 
has 

suffered since the season began. 
Despite the general health of the 

team, the loss of the 6-foot-2, 
252-pound defensive end leaves 
a sizable hole in the defense. 
Ojemudia had recorded 19 tackles, 
including six for loss in five games 
in 2015.

Senior defensive end Royce 

Jenkins-Stone 
is 
listed 
as 

Ojemudia’s primary replacement, 
though 
Harbaugh 
indicated 

Monday 
that 
sophomore 

Lawrence Marshall would also 
see increased repetitions. More 
importantly, however, is whether 
the defense as a whole can 
replace the range and playmaking 
ability 
Ojemudia 
possessed. 

With one of the nation’s deepest 
defensive fronts going up against 
a 
predictable 
offense, 
there 

are plenty of potential options, 
but senior defensive end Chris 
Wormley is the likely candidate 
to get the lion’s share of blitzes as 
he looks to expand on his seven 
tackles for loss, good for sixth in 
the Big Ten.

4. Whose special teams are 
more special?

In a game that is sure to feature 

plenty of adept defense and inept 
offense, special teams will likely 
play a larger role in a low-scoring 
affair. Michigan did a nice job 
controlling reigning All-Big Ten 
kicker Brad Craddock and likely 
All-American returner Will Likely 
in Maryland last week, but the 
Wildcats feature the nation’s No. 
3 kickoff return and No. 38 punt 
return units. Kicker Jack Mitchell 
is also fourth in the nation with 10 
made field goals.

Michigan doesn’t boast the sexy 

numbers, but fifth-year senior 
punter Blake O’Neill, senior kicker 
Kenny 
Allen 
and 
sophomore 

return man Jabrill Peppers have 
been more than consistent enough 
to give the Wolverines superior 
net field position in all five of their 
games this season. As always, the 
winner of the game will score the 

most points, but both teams can do 
themselves a big favor on special 
teams.

Senior linebacker Royce Jenkins-Stone is the No. 1 candidate on the depth chart to replace senior Mario Ojemudia, who injured his Achilles last Saturday at Maryland.
