Throughout much of her 

life, Ciara Sivels had dreams 
of becoming a chef. Now she 
is the first Black woman to get 
a doctoral degree in Nuclear 
Engineering from the University 
of Michigan.

“I really had no idea (about 

engineering) until my junior 
year of high school,” Sivels said. 
“I had a teacher suggest I look 
into engineering because I had 
always been at good at chemistry 
and math, and I constantly 
excelled in all my classes.”

Sivels attended Hickory High 

School in Chesapeake, Va. As a 
student, she was busy working 
to balance multiple Advanced 

Placement credits and after-
school programs, such as her 
school’s Scholastic Bowl. She 
was also highly active within 
her church community.

As senior year progressed 

she started applying to different 
engineering schools. Though 
the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 

of Technology was her “reach 
school,” she was accepted.

When she arrived at MIT, 

Sivels had a heavy background 
in chemistry. But one of her 
mentors suggested she look into 
the nuclear field as she became 
interested in energy, antimatter 
and the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons.

With the election only 11 

days away, President Barack 
Obama 
addressed 
thousands 

of citizens at Cass Technical 
High 
School 
in 
Detroit 

Friday night, highlighting the 
importance of voting blue and 
once again voicing his support 
for 
Democratic 
Candidates 

U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow 
and Gubernatorial Candidate 
Gretchen Whitmer.

Obama emphasized the stakes 

in the upcoming election are 
higher than ever.

“The main reason I am here 

is to make sure all of you vote 
in what I believe might be the 
most important election of our 
lifetime,” Obama said. “The 
stakes in this election are really 
high. Most importantly, the 
character of our country is on 
the ballot.”

Obama called out the GOP, 

pointing 
to 
corruption 
in 

Washington D.C. 

“The outrages just piles up 

and you just forget stuff, so 
remember they promised to 
tackle corruption in Washington 
but turns out in Washington 
they’ve now have racked up 
enough indictments to field a 
football team,” Obama said. 
“You know what. I didn’t have 
folks in my administration get 
indicted. It’s not that hard.”

Obama said the only way 

to recover government as it 
should be, is to hold politicians 

accountable.

“When words stop meaning 

anything, when truth doesn’t 
matter, when people can just 
make up things, then democracy 
it doesn’t work.” Obama went on 
to say, “The only check on bad 
behavior is you and your vote.”

Obama and several other 

speakers at the event called 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 

Michigan no longer has a 
straight ticket ballot. Democratic 
Candidate 
for 
Michigan 

Secretary of State Jocelyn 
Benson said voters need to 
actively vote, not just for big 
ticket items but for every office.

“We need you to fill in every 

bubble,” Benson said. “If you 
don’t tell the story of all of us we 
may not win. We need you to tell 
the story.”

Obama says he sees the 

movement away from a straight 
ticket as just another step by 
Republican parties to repress 
Democratic votes. He advised 

the audience to remember 2008.

“A 
decade 
ago, 
we 
had 

just 
lived 
through 
one 
of 

those periods of Republican 
retrenchment,” 
Obama 
said. 

“The Democrats had to come 
and clean it up.”

He 
explained 
the 
fear 

surrounding the 2018 elections 
is no different than the fears 
that have surrounded previous 
elections.

“Right before the election 

Lorena Muñoz, an assistant 

professor of gender, women 
and sexuality studies at the 
University 
of 
Minnesota, 

discussed 
her 
research 

focusing on comparative work 
between 
Zimbabwean 
and 

Hispanic immigrant domestic 
workers and their relationships 
with their families Friday at a 
talk hosted by the University 
of Michigan departments of 
Latina/o Studies and Women’s 
Studies.

Muñoz 
focused 
on 
the 

emotional 
effects 
economic 

failures have on immigrant 
workers as well as related 
resentment from their children 
at the talk, called “Mothering 
Across 
Borders 
and 
the 

Children Left Behind.”

“For 
some 
domestic 

immigrant 
workers 
in 

transnational motherhood, the 
poverty wages they receive in 
their home communities are not 
enough to sustain their families 
and communities,” she said.

About 
300 
students 
and 

community members gathered 
Sunday afternoon on the Diag to 
host a community vigil following 
a

at 
a 
Pittsburgh 

synagogue over the weekend. 

Eleven 
people 

were 
killed 
while 
attending 

the Saturday morning Shabbat 
service at the Tree of Life 
Congregation in city’s Squirrel 
Hill neighborhood. Four police 
officers and two others were 
also injured. According to the

considered the deadliest attack 

against the Jewish community in 
U.S. history.

Engineering senior Jonathan 

Schermer, whose family attends 
the Tree of Life Congregation, 
spoke 
about 
his 
family’s 

connection to Squirrel Hill and 
encouraged solidarity among the 
Jewish community to empathize 
with those who were impacted 

by the shooting.

“My family is a member of the 

Tree of Life Synagogue,” Shermer 
said. “I was Bar Mitzvah’d at 
Tree of Life. My brother was Bar

of the Tree of Life synagogue.”

LSA 
senior 
Eva 
Rosen, 

who grew up in Pittsburgh’s 
Jewish community, believes 

the incident reveals the reality 
of 
nationwide 
anti-Semitic 

sentiments.

“While this incident has 

changed our community 
forever; it is so much 
bigger 
than 
Squirrel 

Hill, or even Pittsburgh, 
because it has tragically 
proven that anti-Semitism 
is alive and real,” Rosen 
said.

Attendees of the vigil 

turned on their phone 
flashlights and held them 
as the names of the 11 
victims were read.

Lisa Stella, a rabbi at 

University of Michigan 
Hillel, said the attack 
affects 
Jews 
and 
the 

wider community.

“We 
recognize 
that 

identity-based 
violence 

doesn’t only affect the 
Jewish 
community 

and we stand with one 
another against hate of 
all kind,” Stella said. “We 
also want to acknowledge 
that even in the tragedy 
that affected the Jewish 
community 
at 
this 

synagogue, there were a 
lot of people who came to 
help.”

Attendees 
then 

recited a Psalm of David and 
Misheberach, a Jewish prayer 
for healing.

Alum Rachel Hurwitz said 

she felt uplifted from seeing 
community 
members 
and 

Jewish allies coming together 
to mourn.

“I’m feeling empowered by 

the community,” Hurwitz said. 
“It’s really meaningful to see so 
many people, Jewish and not, 
come out to an event like this 
and show their support and 
their care and their love.”

In regard to gun control, 

Hurwitz also emphasized her 
desire for stricter gun control 
policies.

“I’ve always thought that 

gun 
control 
is 
something 

that’s really important and 
something that is lacking in 
this country,” Hurwitz said. 
“If you look at many other 
countries similar to the United 
States, they all have much more 
serious gun control policies 
than we do in this country. I 
think that hate will always find 
a way, but we should make it a 
lot harder for them.”

they try to scare the heck out of 
you and then the election comes 
and magically everything is 
okay,” Obama said.

Obama 
said 
the 
2014 

Ebola scare and the turmoil 
surrounding Hillary’s emails in 
2016 was no different than the 
fears that are propagated today 
by the Republican party.

“(N)ow they’re trying to 

convince everybody that the 
most important thing in this 
election, the thing you got 
to fear are there are a bunch 
of impoverished refugees a 
thousand miles away. It would 
be funny except sometimes we 
fall for it, don’t fall for it again.”

Many speakers addressed the 

Republican threat to healthcare, 
particularly 
healthcare 
for 

people 
with 
preexisting 

conditions. 
Michigan 

Congressional Candidate Elissa 
Slotkin said the primary reason 
she is running for Congress is to 
protect people with preexisting 
conditions.

“What got me into this race 

was my mom,” Slotkin said. “It’s 
important to remember this is 
about people, about the mission 
of helping people.”

Slotkin went on to explain 

her mother had cancer, lost 
her insurance and struggled 
five and a half years without 
insurance, ultimately, declaring 
bankruptcy.

“The man I am running 

against voted to gut health 

insurance 
for 
preexisting 

conditions,” Slotkin said.

Similarly, 
Congresswoman 

Brenda Lawrence said issues 
like healthcare and the recent 
confirmation 
of 
Associate 

Justice of the Supreme Court 
Brett Kavanaugh call for women 
in particular to take action.

“Now women this is our year,” 

Lawrence said amidst applause. 
“If you have not been awakened, 
if you have not been moved, if 
you have not reached the level 
of understanding that this is 
our time to stand up because 
the next generation of girls is 
watching us.”

Whitmer 
also 
highlighted 

the gravity of the impending 
election in the face of the events 
that have taken place since the 
presidential election.

“We know the consequences 

that elections carry,” Whitmer 
said. “We’ve learned. We see it 
everyday on CNN. And I want 
you to remember how you felt 
the morning after that last 
presidential election.”

Obama 
ended 
the 
rally 

encouraging 
voters 
to 
not 

despair or become cynical with 
the current political climate but 
to take the power into their own 
hands by voting.

“I want to be honest with 

you, one election isn’t going 
to fix everything,” Obama 
said. “We’re not going to fix 
everything because of one 
election, but I can promise 
if you vote things are going 
to get better. The biggest 
threat to our democracy is 
indifference.”

There’s a good chance 

that you’ve already heard 
of the iconic Mickalene 
Thomas, but if not, welcome 
to an artist who makes 
beautifully 
exploratory 

paintings. She introduces 
a complex vision of what 
it means to be a woman 
and 
expands 
common 

definitions 
of 
beauty. 

[COPY: 
the 
hyperlinked 

is a direct quote from the 
article, maybe rephrase or 
quote with source?] In many 

of her pieces, you can see 
her confronting eurocentric 
beauty 
standards 
with 

powerful 
displays 
of 

womanhood 
that 
aren’t 

considered conventionally 
attractive. She also uses 
pop art to exemplify these 
explorations of femininity 
further, and is most known 
for her usage of rhinestones, 
glitter and acrylic. You 
can 
discover 
more 
of 

Mickalene’s artwork on her 
website.

Four queer artists of color you need to support

SWATHI KOMARIVELLI

MiC Blogger

How common is it that you go 

on a tattoo artist’s Instagram and 
absolutely fall in love with the art 
they create on bodies? And then 
you scroll through more... and start 
to doubt whether those tattoos 
would ever look good on your skin 
tone because they only use white 
people as their canvases. Ciara 
Havishya is a leftist tattoo artist 
based in Toronto and works with 
Sticks & Stones Tattoo. They are 
dedicated to creating a space for 
queer people of color within tattoo 

culture, and through their tattoos 
you can see the beauty in navigating 
those “in-between cultures,” as they 
phrase it. Their art is beautiful, 
expressive 
and 
intercultural; 
it 

speaks for itself. Everyone should 
immediately 
follow 
them 
on 

Instagram instead of the tattoo 
artists who exclusively believe their 
canvases can only be people with 
skin the color of paper. 

Juliana Huxtable wears many 

hats: She’s an artist, a DJ, a writer 
and a performer. She was born in 
Bryan-College Station, Texas, and 
was mainly on the internet before 
she came to public knowledge. 
The most intriguing aspect of her 
work is how she draws from her 
experience of all her years on the 
internet. Generally, having aspects 

of that in her artwork makes it 
seem less serious or meaningful, 
and she challenges this notion 
very successfully. You can follow 
her on Twitter @julianahuxtable, 
on Instagram with the same @ 
name, and listen to her music on 
Soundcloud.

Out of everyone in 

this list, Janelle Monáe 
is definitely one of the 
most popular figures in 
the public eye right now. 
However, I am including 
her on this list because 
she has consistently made 
incredibly 
beautiful 

music, and her latest 
album, Dirty Computer, 
is no exception. Along 
with 
her 
album, 

she 
also 
made 
an 

“Emotion Picture” that 
accompanied the musical 
portion of her album. She 
has historically shaken 
the table with music 
that consistently pushes 
societal 
boundaries, 

and she will continue 
to do so. Stream Dirty 
Computer on Spotify or 
Apple Music, and watch 
her Emotion Picture. 

On feet and on court, sneaker 

culture has been intertwined 
with the game of basketball 
since its very inception. With 
a new NBA season underway, 
I wanted to take a quick look 
at the state of the NBA sneaker 
landscape. PJ Tucker seal of 
approval pending.

LeBron 15s and 16s
In its 15th iteration, Nike 

finally 
made 
a 
shoe 
that 

matched 
and 
encapsulated 

LeBron’s on-court style of play. 
It’s a shoe fit for a gladiator and 
a perfect embodiment of the 
power and pure locomotive-
ness we’ve seen from LeBron 
for the past decade plus. It looks 
like armor for your foot — but in 
a way that still incorporates and 
utilizes fashion and flair. For 
this reason, I was skeptical of 
the follow-up to LeBron’s best 
shoe yet. While I think the 
16s are a notch below the 
outstanding 15s, they’ve 
also similarly captured 
the 
essence 
of 

LeBron. The “King 
- Court Purple” 
colorway 
LeBron 
rocked 
in 
his 

Staples 
Center 

debut versus the Rockets is an 
absolute banger.

Big Baller Brand announces 

the “ZO2.19”

LaVar 
and 
company 

announced 
the 
release 
of 

Lakers Point Guard Lonzo Ball’s 
second signature shoe with a 

promotional video on SLAM 
last week. The biggest change 
from the original ZO2 and ZO2 
remix? A whopping $295 price 
drop from $495 to a much more 
respectable $200 retail price. 
All in all, it’s a win for common 
sense. Outrageous price points 
don’t 
move 
mass 
product, 

and with a lull in LaVar Ball 
media chatter/hype and Lonzo 
moving to the 
Lakers’ 

bench, 
the 
Big 

Ballers made 
the 

appropriate 

change 

with 
the 

newest ZO2. Even 

so, it’s fair to consider 

how far the independent 

Big Baller Brand can go when it 
comes to carving out a name for 
itself in the sneaker industry. 
With the likes of Nike, Adidas, 
Puma and even the perpetually 
uncharismatic Under Armour, 
the brand built upon the Triple 
B’s seems to be more of a quickly 
fading fad than a company 
constructed 
for 
longevity. 

Here’s to hoping LaMelo fulfills 
his destiny of becoming the 
greatest basketball player ever 
and helps turn around the 
fortunes of Big Baller Brand.

Joel 
Embiid 
signs 
with 

Under Armour

The 
beloved 
larger-than-

life Twitter personality turned 
NBA all-star center recently 
made the switch from Adidas 
to Under Armour in a move that 
mostly flew under the radar. 
If Under Armour was looking 
for a spark and injection of 
personality, they certainly got it 

with the 76ers star and NBA 

Live 19 cover athlete. The 

elephant (or in this 

case, 
the 
7-foot-

tall Cameroonian) 

in the room, 

however, 
is 
the 

longstanding 

notion 
that 
big 

men can’t sell shoes. 

Joel, if properly utilized by 

Under Armour, should be able 
to buck this trend. He has every 
bit of the personality needed 
to cultivate sales, and an all-
NBA level of production on the 
court to boot. With Steph Curry 
working on his sixth shoe under 
the Under Armour umbrella, 
Embiid has enough charisma 
on and off the court to serve as 
UA’s second option.

All in all, it’s been a busy few 

weeks for the sneaker business 
in the opening moments of 
the NBA season. We’re still all 
waiting on a commemorative 
Smush Parker signature line, 
though.

Who am I? This is a question 

that I have been struggling to 
answer for the past two months. 
It is so simple, yet so intricate. 

It’s like I spent my whole 

life working towards one goal: 
college. But now that I’m here, 
I’m like, “Now what?” You see, 
there’s a stigma in the Arab 
American 
community 
that 

when you go to college, you have 
to have your whole life figured 
out and you only have three 
options: pre-law, pre-med, or 
some kind of an engineer-- the 
holy trinity. Funny story, my 
first two days here at Michigan, 
I was pre-med, but then on 
the second day, I came to the 
realization that I hated science. 
I could do it, I was good at it, but 
I couldn’t care less about DNA 
or polymers. By my third day, I 
had dropped my science course, 
taken up a political science 
course, and I could not have 
been happier. 

I was surrounded by people 

that cared about social issues 
and I finally felt like I was on 
the right track. However, the 
question still arose whenever 
I would talk to my khaltos or 
grandma, “What are you going 
to be later in life?” I think that’s 
what I have come to detest 
about my experiences with 
Middle Eastern culture-- that I 
need to have my life figured out 
by the first semester of my first 
year in college. It’s hard enough 
making 
the 
transition 
and 

adjusting to collegiate life, but 
then at the mere age of 18, I have 
to decide what I’m doing for 
the rest of my life. With this in 
mind, I spoke with my parents, 
hashing out my worries and 
pressures. Their replies were 
nothing short of comforting 
as they told me exactly what I 
wanted to hear. 

Happy. 
That 
was 
their 

answer, one simple word. The 
explanation behind “happy” 
was as simple as the actual 

answer. My parents didn’t go 
to college, they came from 
another country and made a 
life in America from absolutely 
nothing. They had no plan 
or course of action, they just 
knew that they wanted to raise 
their future children in a land 
that had a safe environment 
and stable education system. 
By going to college, I had 
fulfilled all of their dreams and 
wishes. They want me to be 

happy because they sacrificed 
everything they’d ever known 
for their children. If I’m not 
happy in the end, then what was 
all their sacrificing for? I could 
be a doctor or an engineer, but 
what kind of a life would it be if 
I was not content? 

Ultimately, 
my 
parents 

surprised me because compared 
to other parents, they were 
wholly understanding. So, does 
the holy trinity truly matter in 
life? No, it doesn’t. Just because 
seemingly everyone I know 
is out here trying to become a 
doctor doesn’t mean that I have 
to be as well. I’m breaking the 
unspoken Arab rule and going 
against the status quo and so 
are my parents by not pushing 
me to do something they know 
I don’t want to do. They let 
me know they supported my 
decisions and I have never been 
happier. So, who am I? I am 
Reem and I am a girl still trying 
to navigate her way through 
her first semester at college and 
I am content doing it because 
I have some amazing parents 
behind me for the journey.

A

s a columnist writing 
about digital governance 
and 
data 
security, 
I 
sometimes wonder if 
my readers actually 
care 
about 
what 
happens to their online 
personal information. 
Amidst 
all 
of 
the 
recent 
headlines 
about 
cybercrime, 
data 
breaches 
and 
data exposure, it is 
hard to come to grips 
with what is actually 
at stake. These events 
seem far off and abstract, and the 
chance of it happening is so slim 
that it could never happen to you, 
right?
To some degree, this view 
is pretty accurate. According 
to Facebook’s second quarter 
earnings report that came out in 
July 2018, there were about 2.23 
billion monthly average users 
of the social network. During 
the recent data security breach 
Facebook reported to its users 
this September, the company 
reset the access tokens for over 50 
million affected accounts, as well 
as 40 million additional accounts 
as 
a 
precautionary 
measure. 
The 4 percent of users who did 
receive a security message should 
consider themselves unlucky, but 
on the whole they did not have 
much to worry about. As of now, 
Facebook reports that no private 
messaging was accessed, and 
no credit card information was 
stolen. Instead, hackers exploited 
a vulnerability in the social 
network developer’s application 
programming interfaces, which 
allows software developers to tap 
into Facebook’s data. The hackers 
stole information linked to a 
user’s profile page such as name, 
hometown and gender.
Although 
Facebook’s 
reputation suffered as a result 
of the incident, Facebook users 
like you and I walked away 
from the incident unscathed 
and 
ultimately 
indifferent. 
There wasn’t a renewal of the 
#deleteFacebook movement that 
drew so much attention after the 
Cambridge Analytica scandal, 
and the coverage on national news 
networks 
was 
overshadowed 
by updates on the Kavanaugh 
confirmation. That being said, 
there is a chance something like 
this could happen again, and 
affected users should consider 
themselves lucky — but not too 
lucky — it was not much worse.

Do 
you 
have 
personal 
information online hackers could 
use to steal your identity? The 
answer 
is 
probably 
overwhelmingly “yes,” 
and the fact is this 
actually happens all 
the time. The Identity 
Theft Resource Center 
reported there were 
1,579 data breaches 
in 2017. In addition, 
about 
14.2 
million 
credit card numbers 
were exposed in 2017, 
an increase of 44.7 
percent from the year prior, as 
well as around 158 million Social 
Security numbers exposed, an 
increase of over eight times the 
figure in 2016.
The numerous data breaches 
are alarming not only because 
of the sheer number of people 
affected, but also due to the high 
growth rate in the prevalence of 
such devastating events. Credit 
card fraud, which usually involves 
a single credit account, is serious, 
but identity theft can be much 
more damaging. When a hacker 
steals your identity, they can 
destroy your financial security by 
opening multiple lines of credit, 
ruining your credit score and 
making it nearly impossible to get 
a loan or apply for a new card. If 
you are still not convinced data 
breaches represent a real problem 
for society, then I have some 
unfortunate news that may hit 
close to home. In 2017, the state 
of Michigan was ranked number 
one for highest per capita rate of 
reported identity theft, with 151 
complaints per 100,000 residents. 
If you seek a pleasant peninsula 
that 
protects 
your 
personal 
information, 
look 
elsewhere 
(perhaps Florida, which comes 
in second at 149 complaints per 
100,000).
Do you care about democracy 
and 
the 
upcoming 
midterm 
elections? If so, data security is 
even more relevant to you. Last 
spring the country was inundated 
with 
news 
surrounding 
the 
political 
consulting 
firm 
Cambridge Analytica and its 
misuse 
of 
Facebook 
users’ 
personal information to influence 
the 2016 presidential election. 
The researchers at Cambridge 
Analytica 
used 
information 
gathered 
from 
a 
personality 
quiz to scrape private data from 
profiles of people who took the 
quiz as well as their friends. This 
data was then used to market 

sometimes 
racist, 
xenophobic 
and 
anti-immigrant 
messages 
directly to users based on their 
constructed psychological profile. 
Facebook permitted this, and 
has since shut the service down, 
but the fact that it was going on 
at all is cause for concern. The 
lack of understanding, oversight 
and control users have over their 
personal information is nothing 
but daunting.
Despite the massive imbalance 
between big tech companies and 
us, there are a few ways users 
can assert a bit more control over 
their digital presence. The first 
way is to write to your senator, 
congressman or elected official to 
do something about it. As of today, 
there is no single, overarching 
data protection legislation in 
the United States. Instead, data 
protection is regulated using a 
tangled web of state and federal 
laws, with the FTC primarily 
overseeing “unfair or deceptive 
practices” related to personal 
information. 
In 
response 
to 
recent data abuses by Silicon 
Valley, Senator Mark Warner, 
D-Va., is fighting vehemently for 
more stringent regulation for 
“information 
fiduciaries” 
who 
hold large amounts of user data.
There 
are 
also 
behavioral 
changes you can make to better 
secure your accounts. Create 
a strong, unique password for 
every new account you make, and 
change it now and then — wouldn’t 
it be disastrous if one hacked 
account led to all your accounts 
being hacked? Take the time to 
read security alerts. Research 
a good password manager that 
can help you stay organized and 
protect your information. In 
short, take whatever small steps 
you can to ensure what you put 
online is a little bit safer.
But all of that is up to you. The 
best case scenario is that you will 
never experience a hack and enjoy 
your time on the internet with no 
problems at all. The worst case 
scenario is that by 2040 quantum 
computers will break the internet 
as we know it and render all of our 
information totally unprotected. 
In the meantime, though, let us 
all make an effort to be more 
attentive towards our precious 
personal 
information 
so 
we 
can enjoy whatever time on the 
internet we have left.

Leading the free world
P

resident Donald Trump 
has finally called out Saudi 
Arabia for the assassination 
of Jamal Khashoggi earlier this 
month. Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident 
and Washington Post columnist 
living in exile, was gruesomely 
murdered while visiting the Saudi 
Arabian consulate in Turkey. The 
sloppy hit, almost assuredly ordered 
by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince 
Mohammed Bin Salman, elicited 
sharp international condemnation. 
In the weeks since, Saudi Arabia 
has awkwardly tried to dodge 
accountability for the operation, first 
denying that Khashoggi died inside 
the consulate, then claiming his death 
occurred accidentally during a fight 
and now blaming his death on rogue 
actors within the state’s security 
apparatus.
For American observers, outrage 
at the assassination and shoddy cover-
up was coupled by disbelief as Trump 
for weeks refused to acknowledge, 
much less condemn, Saudi Arabia’s 
brazen and appalling abuse of power. 
Trump originally criticized other 
countries’ and corporations’ swift 
criticism of Saudi Arabia and floated 
the “rogue killers” theory that 
Saudi Arabia later came to adopt. As 
corporate and political leaders around 
the world withdrew en masse from a 
planned Saudi investment conference, 
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin 
reaffirmed his plans to attend. It 
took another week of feet-dragging, 
during which Trump dispatched 
multiple officials to meet with Saudi 
and Turkish officials, before Trump 
finally cancelled Mnuchin’s trip and 
issued a clear denunciation of the 
killing.
To be fair, the president’s 
eventual 
condemnation 
of 
the 
assassination is a welcome reversal, 
but his delay in doing so reinforces his 
administration’s troubling reluctance 
to call out the autocratic nations. If not 

checked, Trump’s continued public 
admiration for some of the world’s 
most ruthless dictators threatens to 
degrade the United States’ status as 
preeminent leader of the free world 
and dilute American support for 
democracy and human rights abroad.
Trump has consistently praised 
dictators and expressed respect for 
their style of rule both during his 
campaign and after taking office. 
Alarmingly, Trump doesn’t just flatter 
America’s autocratic allies — some of 
his most effusive praises are reserved 
for hostile adversaries. In 2017, Trump 
invited President Rodrigo Duterte of 
the Philippines to the White House 
and characterized his crackdown 
on drugs, which has consisted of the 
extrajudicial killings of thousands, 
as a “great job.” In a June 2018 
interview, Trump downplayed North 
Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s brutal 
repression of his people, instead 
referring to him as a “tough” and 
“very smart” leader. And of course 
there is Trump’s frequent praising 
of Russian President Vladimir Putin, 
whom he has called “far more” of a 
leader than former President Barack 
Obama.
Contrast those statements with 
the criticism and vitriol, often trade-
related, that Trump has tossed 
at democratic allies. He’s called 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau “dishonest” and “weak,” and 
critiqued German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel’s immigration policies, which 
have little to no effect on the United 
States, as “insane.”
However, it is unrealistic to 
perpetually criticize or disassociate 
with every state that restricts political 
freedoms or violates human rights, 
especially in the Middle East. Saudi 
Arabia is a key strategic partner 
and collaboration with the Saudi 
government is crucial to pursuing 
our interests in the region, namely 
suppressing terrorism and countering 

the influence of hostile states such 
as Iran. The U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet 
is headquartered in Bahrain, which 
certainly contributed to the U.S.’s 
silence when the autocratic kingdom 
ruthlessly crushed a popular uprising 
in 2011.
The bottom line is that being one 
of the world’s largest superpowers 
necessitates 
cooperation 
with 
unscrupulous states who don’t share 
our values. But this doesn’t require 
us to ignore the most egregious 
violations, such as the Khashoggi 
killing, nor does it require America 
to abandon its commitment to 
promoting democracy around the 
world.
This 
commitment 
isn’t 
just 
implied — the State Department’s own 
mission statement is to “Create a more 
secure, democratic, and prosperous 
world for the benefit of the American 
people 
and 
the 
international 
community.” America’s record of 
supporting democracy worldwide is 
far from sterling, especially during the 
Cold War era, when the U.S. routinely 
supported authoritarian states in 
order to counter the influence of 
the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the 
goal of democratizing the world and 
protecting human rights is still a 
worthy one that should be pursued 
when at all possible, which is why 
Trump’s repeated praise of dictators 
is so alarming. The U.S. prides itself 
on being the leader of the free world, 
and even though many on the left 
believe that mantle has been passed 
to Merkel, they still hope to reclaim 
it following Trump’s presidency. 
Trump, and his successors, would be 
wise to realize that it is hard to be the 
leader of the free world if you do not 
show any interest in promoting a free 
world.

On Pittsburgh and anti-Semitism
F

our years ago, Jordan, my 
big brother, graduated from 
the University of Michigan 
with a degree in economics and 
moved to Pittsburgh. He relocated 
to a strange new city where he did 
not know a soul. One of the hardest 
experiences for Jews living away 
from family and friends is the Jewish 
high holidays. Luckily for Jordan, 
though, the Tree of Life synagogue 
opened its doors, giving him a warm 
community and a place to pray.
This past Saturday, a deranged 
man entered that same synagogue 
during morning services, shouted 
“All Jews must die!” and took 11 lives 
of that same community.
People are quick to universalize 
this 
tragedy, 
posting 
about 
gun control, white supremacy, 
nationalism and the like. But we 
need to pause and address the root of 
this hate crime: anti-Semitism.
There is no denying that anti-
Semitism has plagued our world for 
millennia. Jews have been expelled 
from countries more than a hundred 
times. From the Spanish Inquisition 
to the Crusades and the Holocaust, 
Jews have been targeted and 
slaughtered. From the Black Plague 
to the infamous Dreyfus Trial and 
Nazi Germany, Jews have been 
blamed for societal ills and others’ 
misfortunes.
Despite 
generations 
of 
persecution, 
genocide 
and 
expulsion, what has ensured the 
Jewish community’s survival is a 
goal-oriented determination, rooted 
in individual responsibility and 
chutzpa (a Yiddish word meaning 
“shameless 
audacity”). 
After 
experiencing the worst systematic 
genocide in human history, the 
Jewish community launched an 
attitudinal revolution against its own 
unhappy past. Survivors sought to 
erase the image of the “ghetto Jews,” 
willingly accepting their demise. Out 
of this tragedy emerged the Jewish 
state of Israel, which is now one of 

the most prosperous and forward-
thinking nations in the world.
Despite 
the 
deep-seeded 
hatred for Jews across the globe, a 
sentiment of strength and communal 
perseverance has and must continue 
to direct the Jewish community. I 
therefore do not want to participate 
in the ongoing competition for “most 
victimized group” and undermine 
others’ oppression.
What I want to highlight, 
though, is the blatant double 
standard both in this community 
and in the mainstream media.
All 
manifestations 
of 
Islamophobia and racism are evil 
and unacceptable, and journalists 
should continue to expose these 
hateful acts. However, hate crimes 
against 
Muslims 
are 
reported 
more than twice as much as those 
against Jews. Without adjusting 
for population size, though, the FBI 
reports twice as many hate crimes 
against Jews (684) than against 
Muslims (307). 2016 FBI data shows 
Jews are three times more likely 
than African Americans and 1.5 
times more likely than Muslims to 
be a victim of a hate crime.
The Anti-Defamation League 
2017 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents 
found the number of anti-Semitic 
incidents in the United States rose 
57 percent in 2017. In fact, Jews 
experienced more religious-based 
hate crimes than all other religious 
groups 
combined. 
Despite 
its 
prevalence, anti-Semitic incidents 
are still grossly underreported.
Anti-Semitism is not just a 
characteristic of fringe groups. In 
fact, it comes from the far left, the far 
right and everywhere in-between.
Prominent religious leader Louis 
Farrakhan repeatedly calls Jews 
“termites” and “Satanic.” Last year’s 
“Dyke March” in Chicago asked 
Jewish participants to leave because 
they displayed a Star of David on their 
pride flags. Georgia Congressman 
Hank 
Johnson 
called 
Jewish 

Israelis “vermin” and “termites.” 
After protestors marched through 
Charlottesville yelling “Jews will not 
replace us,” our president declared 
there were “some very fine people on 
both sides.”
I could also explicate the 
rampant anti-Semitism in Europe 
and Islamic countries, but then this 
article would become a book.
I do not seek to minimize the 
suffering of other discriminated 
communities. All manifestations of 
identity-based hatred and violence 
should and must be addressed. 
However, Jewish identities are 
excluded from social justice rhetoric 
and today’s trendy doctrine of 
intersectionality. Outside of the 
Jewish community, the relative 
silence is deafening.
This past Sunday, Holocaust 
survivors 
and 
their 
children 
traveled to Ann Arbor to tell their 
stories to students. One participant 
was afraid to go inside the building 
because 
the 
luncheon 
lacked 
armed security. The United States 
is no 1930s Europe, but Jews who 
escaped gas chambers and death 
camps should not continue to live in 
fear because of who they are.
If you want to address identity-
based hatred, then do not ignore 
anti-Semitism. 
This 
festering 
disease is too prevalent to overlook.
In light of the tragedy in 
Pittsburgh, 
though, 
religious 
leaders, both Christian and Muslim, 
have fundraised and lent their 
support to the Jewish community. 
Just as the Tree of Life synagogue 
treated my brother like family, so 
has Pittsburgh’s Christian and 
Muslim community treated its 
Jewish neighbors.
We should similarly treat all 
persecuted minorities like brothers 
and sisters in times of vulnerability.

School of Public Policy.

L

ast year, as a freshman, 
I was so focused on 
receiving good grades 
that I often prioritized my 
academic 
performance 
over 
having fun. As a result, one of 
my goals for this year is to attend 
more events, rather than simply 
attending class and sometimes 
venturing to the library when 
I want a change of scenery 
for studying. So far this year, 
I’ve attended comedian Hasan 
Minhaj’s “Before the Storm” 
show at the Michigan Theater, 
author Viet Thanh Nguyen’s 
lecture 
titled 
“Race, 
War, 
and Refugees” and an Eagles 
concert last week in Detroit. I 
also purchased a ticket to attend 
“A Conversation with Michelle 
Obama” in December.
Attending all these events 
has led me to notice there are 
rarely any people who come 
alone. While I did see a few 
people who didn’t appear to be 
with any friends or family, most 
people came with at least one 
or two other companions. This 
makes sense, considering how, 
nowadays, almost every event 
seems to be a social one — there 
are people who are reluctant 
to even go to the bathroom by 
themselves. However, I think 
that there is value in going to 
events without other people.
I attended Minhaj’s show 
alone. None of my friends 
really knew who Minhaj was (a 
travesty!), so I felt bad asking 
them to purchase a ticket to 
see him. While I was initially 
worried about going alone, I 
found going by myself ended 

up being more enjoyable than 
if I had gone with a friend. I 
not only got someone to trade 
tickets with me so he could sit 
closer to his friends, resulting 
in me moving from around the 
19th row to the fourth, I was 
also able to truly focus on the 
show. I didn’t have to worry 
about whether my friend was 
also having a good time or 
feel obligated to interact with 
another person. I left the show 
feeling glad I came alone. This 
led me to attend Nguyen’s 
lecture alone, and I had a 
similarly positive experience 
there.
I 
went 
to 
the 
Eagles 
concert with my family, and 
the experience was far more 
stressful and complicated than 
going to the Minhaj event. 
Before I went to see Minhaj, 
all I had to do was purchase 
the ticket, go to the venue and 
find a seat. For the concert, 
however, I had to find four seats 
together in a section everyone 
was fine sitting in and check 
with everyone to make sure 
their schedules were free the 
day of the concert. The day of 
the performance, all of us had 
to wait for each other to finish 
getting ready, and once we 
finally got in the car and arrived 
at the venue, we all had to wait 
for each other when we ordered 
food or went to the bathroom. 
During 
the 
performance, 
I 
had to listen to my family 
members try to talk to me when 
I just wanted to focus on the 
performance, and there were 
times when I tried talking to 

them when they just wanted to 
focus on the performance.
However, I am still glad I 
didn’t go to the Eagles concert 
alone, because I think concerts 
are 
much 
more 
enjoyable 
for people when they have 
companions who aren’t afraid 
to dance and sing along with 
them. I probably would not 
want to attend a sporting 
event without a friend, either, 
because cheering alone can feel 
awkward. In addition, going to a 
venue far away and late at night 
can be dangerous for people 
going alone.
While 
these 
are 
among 
several valid reasons for not 
wanting to go to an event alone, 
feeling as though attending 
an 
event 
alone 
is 
socially 
unacceptable or doomed to end 
in boredom is not an acceptable 
reason. As harsh as it may 
seem, the truth is that being 
around friends or family can 
be annoying, and being alone is 
often the least stressful option. 
Because I didn’t know any of 
the 
other 
people 
attending 
Minhaj’s show or Nguyen’s 
lecture, I had an anonymity 
that allowed me to keep mostly 
to myself and focus solely on the 
performance.
In short, not every event 
needs to be a social one, and 
it’s OK not to be surrounded 
by a gaggle of friends wherever 
you go. Sometimes, the best 
company is no company at all.

“Don’t Pass Cars / On Curve 

or Hill / If the Cops / Don’t 
Get You / Morticians Will.” 
“If Daisies Are Your / Favorite 
Flower / Keep Pushin’ Up / 
Those 
Miles-Per-Hour.” 
“If 

You / Don’t Know / Whose 
Signs / These Are / You Can’t 
Have / Driven Very Far.”

If none of these phrases are 

familiar to you, it likely has 
less to do with how far you’ve 
driven and more to do with the 
fact that this is 2018. From the 
late ’20s through the early ’60s, 
poems like these were painted 
on advertisements for Burma-
Shave, a company known for 
spacing out its iconic red, 
white-lettered signs along the 
sides of roads. Some had to do 
with shaving (“Shaving Brushes 
/ You’ll Soon See ‘Em / On the 
Shelf / In Some / Museum”), 
some with road safety (“It’s 
Best For / One Who Hits / 
The Bottle / To Let Another / 
Use the Throttle”). The main 
trademarks were their dry wit 
and funny, memorable rhymes.

Today I’m going to use this 

space to talk about an odd little 
corner of the literature world: 
signs. This column has always 
been about pieces of literature 
that 
aren’t 
often 
analyzed 

critically or sometimes even 
considered literature to begin 
with. I believe that the subject 
of signs is fitting and that 
signs, in all sorts of contexts, 
are indeed literature — and 
not only that, they also offer 
us windows into culture and 
humanity in a way that few 
other types of literature can.

To illustrate what I mean, 

here are two of my most recent, 
memorable experiences with 
signs. The first happened two 
weeks ago, when a few friends 
and I were on our way back to 
Ann Arbor after spending a long 
weekend in Washington, D.C., 
and Baltimore for fall break. 
The drive back was nearly 10 
hours, and a lot of it was spent 
in silence — we hadn’t slept 
much the night before, and all 
of us were anxious to get home 
and rest.

So, for about three continuous 

hours, we played the Alphabet 
Game. I’d played so many times 

before, on countless road trips 
with my parents and family 
and other friends, and the 
game was classic, familiar and 
fun. We’d taken a route that 
avoided tolls and therefore 
spent a lot of time on smaller, 
winding and uneventful roads, 

but even on these, when we did 
happen upon a town or a cluster 
of houses, we found so many 
unexpected gems: “Quarry.” 
“Quartz.” “Junction.” “Zeal.” 
And then, of course, there were 
the midterm election signs 
that peppered so many yards, 
beckoning locals to vote for 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 

we’d never heard of.

The 
second 
experience 

was last weekend, when I ran 
the Detroit Free Press’ U.S.-
only half marathon. I pretty 
much hadn’t trained at all, and 
was feeling the weight of the 
distance as early as four or five 
miles in. But all along the way, 
people in Detroit had gathered 
— some in big block parties, 
some in small clusters — with 
signs: “Worst Parade Ever!” “I 
trained for MONTHS to hold 
this sign!” “That’s a lot of work 
for a free banana!” and “New 

mile who dis?”

Some were more creative 

than 
others, 
but 
in 
my 

struggle to keep getting the 
miles behind me, I smiled at 
almost all of them. I had also 
run the Chicago Marathon 
my sophomore year, a month 
ahead of the 2016 election, and 
seen a lot of similar signs back 
then. Some had the exact same 
phrases. The main difference 
was that in Chicago, I also saw 
political jokes everywhere I 
looked: “If Trump can run, so 
can you” and, “Run like Trump 
is trying to grab your p*ssy.”

I don’t usually think about 

or look at signs unless they’re 
right in front of my face. I 
think it’s fair to say I’m like 
most people in that regard. 
But in many ways, the signs 
we make are a bellwether for 
what we’re thinking and what 
we value. There are the ones 
made by companies, billboards 
and 
advertisements 
along 

highways, 
storefront 
signs, 

neon signs. And then there are 
the ones made by individuals — 
standing up for politicians they 
like, or against the politicians 
they dislike, or simply touting 
a funny joke meant to help 
another 
person 
along. 
The 

night before the half-marathon, 
my mom and I saw a crowd 
of people gathered outside a 
hotel in Detroit, chanting and 
picketing something for hours 
in the freezing sleet and snow, 
all holding signs.

Signs show us what humor we 

appreciate, what we’re willing 
to stand for and what we won’t 
tolerate. They show us what our 
culture values aesthetically, 
and what language we speak. 
The first time I left the U.S., 
the signs were the first thing 
that stood out to me: giving 
directions 
and 
information, 

simple and familiar things, in 
a language other than the one 
I’d never realized I always took 
for granted. Walking around 
airports and train stations, 
driving 
through 
cities 
and 

towns and walking down busy 
streets — I was in that country, 
Germany, for a week and a half, 
and I was still reading signs 
everywhere we went by the 

time we left. I 
never got tired 
of it.

A sign may 

not 
be 
much 

like a book, but 
I think it is at 
least 
possible 

to read a sign 
like 
a 
poem. 

I 
even 
think 

it’s poetic that 
a sign comes 
with so much 
surrounding it: 
the place and 
the context in 
which you saw 
it, the person 
showing 
it 

to you. Signs 
interact with us 
all the time, and 
not in purely 
functional 
ways: 
They 

keep 
us 

awake 
during 

long 
trips, 

they 
propel 

us 
through 

tough 
races 

and 
games 

because 
they 

remind us that 
people, 
even 

total strangers, 
are out there 
rooting 
for 

us, or looking 
out for us. We 
make 
signs 

for 
concerts, 

for 
picking 

people 
up 
at 

the 
airport, 

for 
parades 

and 
rallies. 

It’s funny that 
something 
designed 
to 

relay such little 
information 
can 
actually 

tell 
you 
so 

much, but there 
you have it.

What signs tell us 
about ourselves

Last weekend, I ventured 

down to a part of Ann Arbor I’ve 
never been to before. Another 
Daily Arts Writer joined me, and 
though it was tough to find, we 
were determined to watch “The 
Stone Witch” for its opening 
night at Ann Arbor’s new venue, 
Theatre Nova.

“The Stone Witch” by Shem 

Bitterman is about young artist 
Peter Chandler, who was hired to 
help the world’s most illustrious 
children’s book author, Simon 
Grindberg, finish his overdue 
book. I wasn’t familiar with this 
play before watching, but the plot 
was clear enough to follow along.

Theatre Nova is comprised 

of a simple, black box theater. It 
has been a long time since I’ve 
watched a performance in such 
an intimate space, and I enjoyed 
being close enough to actually 
see the actors’ facial expressions.

I was impressed by the high 

production value of the play. 
The space was well-used and 
the set was detailed, with many 
decorations 
that 
reflected 

Grindberg’s 
character. 
The 

lighting was used intentionally, 
which I appreciated because it 
can often become overwhelming, 
especially in smaller venues.

In 
particular, 
Dennis 

Kleinsmith’s 
performance 
as 

Grindberg stood out. He delivered 
his lines with power and seemed 
to capture the audience with all 
of his scenes. Because there are 
only three actors in the play, his 
death at the end makes us feel his 
physical loss, and the stage feels 
empty without him.

Though there were some sad 

moments in the play, a lot of 
humor balanced out these parts, 
and the audience could be heard 
laughing along enthusiastically. 
Watching the progression of 
Chandler’s 
relationship 
with 

Kleinsmith is endearing and 

sweet, and touches on how 
special the mentor and mentee 
relationship can be. It’s a story 
that 
anyone 
can 
relate 
to, 

regardless of age, gender or 
ethnicity.

Ethan Kankula’s performance 

of Chandler was also admirable, 
though 
there 
were 
a 
few 

times 
where 
Chandler 
had 

outbursts of surprise or anger 
that felt uncharacteristic for 
Kankula’s portrayal. Despite this 
spottiness, 
Kankula 
depicted 

Chandler’s 
character 
growth 

realistically and with charisma.

I found the scene when 

Chandler 
and 
Grindberg 
go 

swimming to be jarring because 
it started progressing towards 
nudity. Both actors ended up 
remaining in their boxers, but 
the choice to have them remove 
clothing didn’t add anything to 
the performance and felt slightly 
uncomfortable. This scene didn’t 
detract from my experience 
viewing the play, but it didn’t 
enhance it either.

My favorite part about the 

play was the idea of imagination. 
Chandler and Grindberg are 
incredibly curious and creative, 
and this was fleshed out through 
their dialogue and the props 
of their drawings. The use of a 
screen to portray the witch or a 
change in setting also conveyed 
the importance of strong visuals 
to the characters as they created 
illustrations for the book and 
sometimes got lost in them.

Overall, “The Stone Witch” 

was a relaxing and comical way 
to spend my Friday night. By the 
end of the play, I noticed many 
of the audience members were 
regular attendees of Theatre 
Nova’s 
productions, 
and 
I 

think that speaks highly to the 
quality and portrayals of their 
productions. They’ve figured out 
how to choose and direct plays 
that resonate with the majority 
of 
their 
audience 
members, 

allowing us to enjoy the simple 
beauty in their plays.

If you want to watch “The 

Stone Witch,” it will be running 
at Theatre Nova until Nov. 11.

Theatre Nova’s ‘The Stone
Witch’ portrays beauty in

ALBUM REVIEW

Louis The Child, the EDM 

duo that has helped accelerate 
electronic 
music’s 
diffusion 

into the mainstream with their 
future-pop sound, released their 
second EP this past Thursday. 

The project, Kids At Play, features 
a dichotomous sound that partly 
reflects the group’s roots as 
a SoundCloud gem for EDM 
fans and its recent shift toward 
future-pop hit machine (with 
slightly more dignity than The 
Chainsmokers).

Louis The Child made a name 

for itself in 2014, when EDM 
began to morph from a pit of 
avant-garde 
wubs 
and 
noisy 

screeches into a musical genre 
that tastefully pushed boundaries 
of common sound. In this era, 
the young duo released beautiful 
remixes of Zella Day’s “Compass,” 
Oh Wonder’s “Body Gold” and 
SoySauce’s “Broken Record” that 
popped with synthetic texture 
and seemed to be crafted with 
the laudable goal of advancing 
EDM’s artistic credentials. Not 
only were these tracks as sonically 
mind-boggling 
as 
the 
future 

bass hits of big names like Flume 
or Odesza, but they were also 
extremely accessible, warm and 
fun characteristics that were rare 
in electronic music.

The duo rode this unique wave 

through breakout singles “It’s 
Strange” and “The Weekend,” 
but, as their popularity grew, 
Louis 
began 
releasing 
short 

and shallow singles featuring a 

sole female vocalist and mildly 
innovative production, similar to 
those corny hits from Zedd or The 
Chainsmokers that blasphemously 
crack The Billboard Hot 100. 
These songs certainly reached a 
wider audience, but they seemed 
to falter in quality and integrity 
accordingly; 
OG 
Louis 
fans 

were left scratching their heads, 
quietly in denial that their go-to 
for accessible EDM had sold 
out. Fortunately, this downward 
trend was eventually stifled by a 
SoundCloud-only release of EDM 
instrumentals that represented 
a return to Louis’s roots, letting 
these puzzled fans rest easy 
and forging an afterglow of 
contentment that lasted through 
Louis’s next string of pop releases.

From 
here, 
an 
interesting 

pattern arose: Louis The Child 
would grow their fan base with 
increasingly accessible and catchy 
pop tracks, and just before EDM 
purists would jump ship, the duo 
would drop sonically progressive 
music to quell the outrage. This 
back-and-forth between pop hits 
and EDM bangers became part 
of Louis’ identity; the duo could 
make your party pop and make 
your head spin. Now, with Kids At 
Play, the duo’s dual personalities 
operate on the same project and 
oppose one another on a track-
by-track basis, as opposed to the 
previous dichotomous releases.

“Interstellar,” the EP’s opener, 

features a wide, synthetic pre-
chorus 
reminiscent 
of David 

Guetta or Calvin Harris in the 
early 2010s, masterfully dropping 
into a video game-esque beat with 
the perfect blend of space and 
sound, characteristics of the Louis 
The Child of years past. After 
faith in the duo’s EDM production 
prowess is reaffirmed, the project 
jumps to the other end of the 
spectrum with two pop tracks, 
“Breaking News (with RAYE)” 

and “Better Not (with Wafia).” 
While these songs might be poppy 
and shallow, they’re certainly feel-
good tracks whose superficiality is 
less noticeable when preceded by 

“Interstellar.” “Ohhh Baby” hops 
back over to bangerville, and then 
a 3-song pop streak follows. The 
EP ends with a track featuring 
another 
EDM 
powerhouse, 

Big Gigantic, followed by an 
“instrumental” (it’s electronic) 
that parallels the projects opener.

At the end of it, whether you 

hopped on the Louis bandwagon 
in 2015 or 2018, you’re left with 
mixed feelings, as you were 
delivered a very mixed sound; 
either the heavy EDM made you 
uncomfortable, or the campy 
pop made you cringe. With that 
said, the duo is clearly capable 
of catering to more than one fan 
base, and given EDM’s diffusion 
into mainstream popularity and 
general development of many 
subgenres in recent years, you 
can’t blame Louis for riding the 
wave and diversifying its sound. 
Doing so is certainly better than 
the alternative, in which part of 
the group’s fanbase is unsatisfied 
and alienated in the midst of its 
demand for new content. For now, 
Louis The Child’s double-dealing 
works well.

There’s 
something 
about 

a director who could have 
used slow motion in so many 
scenes, 
but 
chose 
not 
to. 

Jimmy Chin (“Meru”) is one of 
those directors, and his 2018 
documentary “Free Solo” is 
his successful experiment in 
such measures of directorial 

restraint.

“Free 
Solo” 
follows 
the 

physical, mental and emotional 
journey 
Alex 
Honnold 

undertakes to become the first 
person to climb Yosemite’s 
3,000-foot wall El Capitan 
free solo, “free solo,” meaning 
without ropes or other safety 
gear. 
However, 
viewers 

expecting a familiar, feel-good, 
man-versus-nature epic should 
beware. While “Free Solo” is 
about a major feat of mankind, 
it resists audience expectations 
for such a film at every turn.

The 
vignette-style 

storytelling 
in 
the 

documentary, 
for 
instance, 

may 
surprise 
audiences. 

Adherence 
to 
chronological 

momentum seems only natural 
for such a story: man dreams 
of something all his life, man 
trains, 
man 
overcomes 
set 

of obstacles, man prevails. 
Instead, the narrative advances 
like patchwork, scenes stitched 
together to illuminate aspects 
of 
Honnold’s 
personality, 

background 
and 
motivation 

in an unregimented fashion. 
Chin’s use of vignettes thus 
removes the pressures of time 
and sidesteps the contrivance 

of climax that might have given 
cause for some eye-rolling and 
undermined the authenticity of 
Honnold’s struggles. This mode 
of storytelling respects not 
only the subject of the film but 
its viewers, too; freed from the 
condescension of melodrama, 
the viewer can focus on what is 
in front of them as opposed to 
what is coming next.

Some of the questions the 

film poses — as well as those it 
must flout in turn — might also 
come as a surprise to viewers. 
Take, for example, the role 
of Sanni McCandless in the 
documentary. McCandless is 
Honnold’s girlfriend, and let 
us first note that, in another 
display of Chin’s directorial 
prudence, she receives the 
respect 
secondary 
cast 

members 
in 
documentaries 

rarely receive. The centrality 
of Honnold’s role in the film 
is not used as an excuse to 
define her strictly in relation 
to him. The filmmakers avoid 
the obvious questions — reality 
television questions, like “Will 
Alex’s free spirit be tamed by 
Sanni’s desire to settle down?” 
— and instead, ask something 
much more compelling: If, like 
Honnold, you are hopelessly in 
love with what you do, what is 
left for the people you love? Do 
you still need another person’s 
love?

Chin 
engages 
another 

particularly 
compelling 

question in “Free Solo” — a 
question a more self-important 
director 
wouldn’t 
dare 

address. Chin himself makes 
multiple appearances in the 
documentary, more often than 
not confessing his reservations 
about the making of the film 
itself. 
In 
one 
particularly 

telling interview, Chin voices 
his 
gravest 
fear: 
Honnold 

falling out of the frame to his 
death through the lens of his 
camera, and not being able 
to do anything but watch. 

The director questions his 
role in the documentary in a 
self-aware, humble way. How 
complicit is the documentarian 
in the events he captures? If 
the very real possibility of 
Honnold’s death were captured 
on film, what would that mean 
for Chin and his crew?

While these deliberations 

of Chin’s were purposeful, 
in another respect, he just 
got lucky: Alex Honnold is a 
character. Perhaps one has to 
be to climb a 3,000-foot rock. 
Yet Chin was wise enough to 
recognize this and let Honnold 
be himself. He could have 
exploited him, overwrote him. 
Instead, 
he 
respected 
him 

enough to let him inflect his 
own story with his own voice 
— his own sardonic, witty and 
ever-memorable voice.

The 
carefulness 
of 
this 

documentary 
culminates 
in 

the final climactic sequence, 
capturing Honnold’s successful 
climb of El Capitan. Perhaps 
the 
most 
telling 
detail 
of 

the 
composition 
of 
this 

sequence is that the dramatic 
score one would expect to 
accompany astonishing shots 
of the grandeur of nature is 
perforated by the sounds of 
Honnold’s 
labored 
breath. 

The elegant inelegance, the 
intimacy that makes “Free 
Solo” a standout documentary, 
is encapsulated in the radical 
passion Honnold’s lives and 
literally breathes.

And 
what 
is 
this 
the 

culmination of? A viewing 
experience that feels more 
like reading a personal essay 
— the paragon of idiosyncratic, 
humbling, precious intimacy 
— as opposed to recycling any 
tired formulas of this genre 
of film. In other words, a 
viewing experience like no 
other, and, in this increasingly 
oversaturated, 
overfiltered 

world, a viewing experience 
desperately needed.

‘Free Solo’ has intimacy 
of a wildly personal essay

TV REVIEW

groundbreaking, 
its 
nearly 

flawless execution makes the 
miniseries a worthwhile watch.

Over the pond, “Bodyguard” 

has broken records one after 
the other. Its finale was the 
most watched episode in UK 
television history, seen by over 
17 million viewers. An easily 
bingeable six-episode thriller, 
it 
stars 
Richard 
Madden 

(“Game of Thrones”) as Sgt. 
David Budd, a police officer and 
Afghanistan veteran who gains 
notoriety after preventing a 
deadly terrorist attack in a 
train through a combination of 
diplomatic skill and compassion 
to the unwilling bomber. He 
ends up being promoted to the 
role of main security officer for 
Home Secretary (the British 
equivalent of Secretary of State) 
Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes, 
“The Missing”), an ambitious, 
hawkish conservative politician 
whose views are completely at 
odds with Budd’s own.

The opening 20 minutes of 

the first episode are the show 
at its strongest. Tension slowly 
escalates as Budd hunts for 
the suspect, while trying to 
protect the train’s passengers, 
including his own children. 
Budd is the familiar stoic, 
steely-eyed agent for most of 
the series, but his solo scenes 
are effective in showing the 
kinks in his armor. Madden, 
while not quite given free rein 

to showcase his range as much 
as he could, delivers a nuanced, 
understated performance that 
meshes 
well 
with 
Hawes’s 

portrayal 
of 
Montague, 
a 

fierce politician not afraid of 

making enemies in her own 
cabinet. Both are difficult to 
completely pin down in terms 
of personality. Montague in 
particular straddles a line of 
seeming genuine and seeming 
like 
an 
extremely 
skilled 

manipulator. 
Even 
Budd 

is shrouded under a veil of 
mystery, which gives hints to 
explain his present PTSD but 
prevents viewers from fully 
being able to empathize with 
him.

While some cliché turns, 

such as Budd and Montague’s 
eventual 
romance,

the 
story’s

hamper its breakneck pace, 
either. From the second episode 
onward, “Bodyguard” seems 
determined to keep viewers 
on their toes. Perceptions of 
characters can change within 
the space of five minutes, 
multiple 
times 
within 
one 

episode, in a manner which 
at times can feel disorienting. 
Nonetheless, this aspect was 
probably the most powerful 
in terms of keeping viewers 
hooked when it first aired. The 
turns require more and more 
suspension of disbelief, but the 
series never devolves into the 
tackiness that plagues so many 
American imitations. 

“Bodyguard” 
sometimes 

veers into the territory of being 
too convoluted for its own 
good, but for the most part, it 
is easy to see why it attracted 
so much attention. Impeccably 
produced, brilliantly acted and 
effectively paced, “Bodyguard” 
is a perfectly quick yet engaging 
watch.

The Rosens’ last job
A 

little under 20 years 
ago, Mark and Leisa 
Rosen 
were looking 
for their last 
job.
The couple 
had coached 
volleyball 
together at 
Boise State 
in 1998, but 
they wanted 
to start a 
family. So 
they needed a stable job to 
facilitate a changing home-life 
— one that, if all went well, 
would be the only job Mark 
and Leisa would have for the 
rest of their careers.
Michigan fit the bill then, 
as Mark joined as the head 
coach in 1999, bringing Leisa 
along as an assistant before 
she became the associate head 
coach. Twenty years later, the 
Rosens are still here.
Mark is now the winningest 
volleyball coach in Wolverines 
history, and he has done it all 
with Leisa, the associate head 
coach, by his side.
The pair has overseen nine 
All-Americans and 16 of the 17 
NCAA Tournament berths in 
Michigan’s history.
“We talk about it now,” 
Mark said of the 20-year 
benchmark. 
“We’re both 
very, we don’t 
have a lot of 
pictures in our 
house. We’re 
not people 
that think a lot 
about the past. 
We think about 
the current, the 
present. But, 
you know, when 
we see (former players) it 
makes me think about that.”
On Saturday, the Rosens’ 
former players were at Crisler 
Center in droves. Six of them 
stood behind Rosen and a 
group of reporters following 

the Wolverines’ straight-set 
loss to No. 3 Minnesota.
The smiles and laughs the 
players were sharing were not 
indicative of the result of the 
match they had just watched.
Mark and 
Leisa’s first 
recruit, Erin 
Brown was at 
Crisler Center 
too, though she 
wasn’t on the 
floor after the 
game. Mark says 
Brown stays 
with the Rosens 
“all the time.”
“My sons 
think of her as a sister,” Rosen 
said.
That is the most prominent 
example of tenets Mark and 
Leisa have tried to instill in 
the program from day one.
“When Leisa and I got here, 

we wanted to build a program 
based on values,” Rosen said. 
“… It is a family, you know, 
but it’s not the same. It’s not 
the same as blood relatives. 
But we wanted an atmosphere 
where people 
cared about 
each other — 
where people 
were unselfish, 
where people, 
you know, 
they put their 
teammates and 
their program 
ahead of 
themselves and 
really cared 
about each other deeper than, 
‘Hey, I played next to you. We 
were teammates.’
“And so, when we go to a 
wedding, and we see so many 
of the players come back and 
be there for their teammates, 

that makes me really proud, 
because it’s like, that’s our 
culture.”
Freshman outside hitter 
Paige Jones already feels the 
family atmosphere in her first 
season. She says 
it permeates 
through the 
whole program, 
stemming from 
the closeness of 
the players just 
as much as the 
Rosens.
But it isn’t 
a coincidence 
that a team run 
by a husband 
and wife feels familial to the 
players within it.
“Mark and Leisa are 
awesome,” Jones said. “They 
have our back. They want 
the best for us in everything 
besides volleyball.

“Leisa is definitely more, I 
don’t want to say aggressive — 
she’s more fiery,” Jones said. 
“She’s the one that will get on 
us, because she knows that 
that will make us better. She 
said yesterday 
in the locker 
room that she’d 
rather beat 
up on us than 
another team 
come out and 
beat up on us. 
And then Mark 
is, I mean, they 
both have great 
volleyball IQ. So 
Mark is the one 
that’s just telling us what we 
can do better in more of a laid-
back type of way.”
Apparently that mix of 
coaching styles has worked. 
The Wolverines had a tough 
weekend on the court, as 

they also lost to Wisconsin 
on Friday night, but the two 
losses are just Michigan’s 
fourth and fifth losses of the 
season.
The Wolverines are on track 
to make their 17th NCAA 
Tournament under the Rosens.
It would have been hard for 
anyone to imagine just how 
well Mark and Leisa’s hiring 
would work out for both them 
and Michigan.
“It’s cool to now fast 
forward 20 years later and 
say, ‘You know what, we 
made a really good choice,’ ” 
Mark said. “You know, it’s a 
great place to be. We love it 
here. I love everything about 
Michigan, in terms of the 
academics, the atmosphere, 
the culture. It’s a great place. 
So I feel really good that we 
ended up here.”
It’s easy to say that with 
the success the Wolverines 
have had under Rosen, but you 
can tell Rosen is talking more 
about the non-volleyball parts 
of his job and Michigan as a 
whole. He speaks most fondly 
of the players he has had in his 
20 seasons, like the ones who 
came back to Ann Arbor this 
weekend.
The Rosens have established 
themselves as good coaches, 
and they have done it by 
establishing 
their culture.
Everything 
has gone well 
enough for them 
to still be in 
Ann Arbor.
In the 
middle of their 
20th season 
at the head 
of Michigan, 
it seems the 
Rosens found their last job 
after all.

EVAN AARON/Daily
Michigan volleyball coaches Leisa and Mark Rosen have left an undeniable mark on their program in their 20 seasons at the helm together.

Blue line dominates in Michigan’s 
3-1 win over St. Lawrence Saturday

When Quinn Hughes went left 
against St. Lawrence, he was, 
more often than not, right.
In the No. 12 Michigan hockey 
team’s 3-1 win over the Saints, 
the sophomore defenseman quite 
literally found a zone — the left 
point. Whether it was his score 
or one of his two assists, the 
Wolverines relentlessly funneled 
their offense to the left point.
Michigan started the game 
with a lot of pressure on the 
Saints’ back line, dominating the 
puck for much of the first period. 
While St. Lawrence goaltender 
Austin Brey started the game 
strong, the Saints’ blue line 
didn’t do him any favors.
Although 
St. 
Lawrence 
crowded the center of the ice 
near the goal, that left the rest 
of the offensive zone free for 
Michigan. As a result, each of 
the Wolverines’ 13 shots in the 
first period went unblocked by 
the Saints’ defense, with most of 
those coming from the top of the 
zone.
“[St. Lawrence] gets a stick 
on you or an arm on you, they 
really make it difficult for you to 
do anything down low and even 
on the rush they have people 
back,” said MIchigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “ … So what that does is 
open up the blue 
line. You have to 
go low to high 
and 
then 
just 
get to the next, 
and get in traffic 
and make things 
happen.”
Brey matched 
his 
Herculean 
effort 
from 
Friday 
night 
before with 37 
saves, and started off by blocking 
a slapshot by sophomore forward 
Jack Becker from the top-middle 
of the zone, then doing the same 
minutes later on a shot from 
freshman forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe.
The 
Wolverines, 
though, 
dialed up the intensity, eventually 

finding twine 5:52 into the game 
when Norris deflected in a shot 
from Hughes with his left skate. 
In the third period, Michigan 
scored an almost-identical goal, 
as Olmstead notched his first 
career goal after getting behind 
Brey and taking in Hughes’ pass 
from the left point.
With the Wolverines bringing 
the 
heat 
at 
even 
strength, 
the 
offensive 
flow 
naturally 
transferred over 
to the power play 
as well. Seven 
minutes 
after 
the 
first 
goal, 
Hughes 
found 
himself in the 
same 
spot 
as 
before, corralled 
a cross-ice pass from senior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi 
and knocked in another score to 
increase the Wolverines’ lead to 
2-0.
“Their forwards were coming 
out really hard so we didn’t have 
a lot of time,” Hughes said. “Like 
I said before, we have to make a 

quick play and fortunately we 
had good screens.”
Even while Michigan couldn’t 
take advantage of its next three 
power-play 
opportunities, 
its 
blue line held strong, though, 
holding the Saints to 19 shots 
for the game — and only five 
shots in the second period. St. 
Lawrence’s lone goal came off a 
faceoff rebound that careened to 
the net — one of just two shots for 
the Saints in the period.
And after allowing 11 shot 
attempts on the left side of 
the ice in the first period, the 
Wolverines allowed just two in 
the second period. On a Saints 
breakaway, freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann deflected a shot 
with the outstretched tip of his 
right mitt, just barely preventing 
a top shelf goal. For the game, 
Mann saved 18 shots.
While Michigan won’t always 
be able to pick and choose its 
spots on either side of the puck as 
much as it did Saturday, keeping 
that intensity and pressure both 
ways will serve them well as they 
move on to bigger and better 
opponents.

Michigan defense stepping up

Few numbers speak louder for 
a defense than a shutout and one-
goal-conceding game.
Over 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Michigan hockey team swept 
St. Lawrence, winning 3-0 and 
3-1 Friday and Saturday night, 
respectively. The wins came in 
large part due to its resurgent 
defense. 
“I think the last couple games, 
we gave up, I don’t know the 
exact number, but I think it was 
around 20 goals,” said sophomore 
defenseman Quinn Hughes. “So 
obviously, it’s not good enough if 
we want to win. I think one of the 
main focus points coming into 
this weekend was cleaning up 
our defensive game, and I think 
we did a really good job with that 
this weekend.”
A good job might be putting it 
lightly. Having turned the ship 
around, the Wolverines’ united 
defense 
played 
earnestly, 
a 
welcoming display for fans after 
letting five goals in each of the 
their first three games.
Shot 
blocking, 
defensive 
hustle and upped physicality 
all contributed. A team needs 
all three in order to hold the 
opposition under 20 shots — as 
Michigan did both nights this 
weekend. The biggest display 
of a defensive team effort is the 
discipline.
Previously, 
the 
Wolverines 
committed 15 penalties through 
three games. Over the weekend, 
they committed only one each 
game — coinciding with the best 
defensive performances of the 
year.
“How many did we take 
yesterday, just one? I think that 
speaks for itself,” said sophomore 
forward Josh Norris. “You know, 
(Michigan coach Mel Pearson) 
is always preaching about being 
the least penalized team in the 
country. And, starting yesterday, 
for the most part, I think we were 
pretty disciplined and especially 
against a team like that, that’s 
pretty physical and can get 
underneath your skin, so I think 
we did a good job with that.”
St. Lawrence won’t just get 
underneath the opposing team’s 

skin. The Saints will get above 
it too. As Pearson noted, they 
have sticks and arms around 
players that make it difficult to 
do anything down low — which 
is where they focused in return.
“They collapsed down low,” 
Pearson said. “They really clog 
it up. Even on the rush they have 
people back.
“They do a good job. They play 
defense first. They really grind.”
Down low is where a lot 
of the physical nature of the 
game comes into play. Battles 
for positions, hard drives and 
scruffles for the rebound define 
the area of play. So it’s easy to 
see how penalties will get called 
where sticks, bodies and words 
are easily exchanged.
“We’re really trying to up 
the ante on physicality in the 
d-zone,” said freshman forward 
Michael Pastujov. “And anyone 
who knows me knows I’m not a 
big hitter, but the opportunity 
was there so I just took it and 
I think it shows that even the 
guys who aren’t known to be big 
hitters could still play physical.”
But throughout the weekend, 
the Wolverines played within the 
boundaries of the game except 

for two moments. 
The only lapse in the first game 
came from an unnecessary play.
“I didn’t like the one penalty 
we took,” Pearson said. “In the 
offensive zone, just jumped up 
and hit a guy, and we didn’t need 
to.”
The 
second? 
Just 
as 
unnecessary — as senior forward 
Brendan Warren committed a 
minor interference resulting in 
a call. 
“Hockey 
is 
a 
game 
of 
mistakes,” Pearson said. “You’re 
gonna make mistakes. and you’re 
just trying to limit how many 
you make and not make them in 
critical times.”
And 
that’s 
part 
of 
the 
discipline that was showed both 
nights. Even though the two 
penalties were committed, they 
were done in times where they 
didn’t really attribute to the flow 
of the game.
“If we can do that, we continue 
to keep it three or under power 
plays a game, we’re going to be 
in good shape,” Pearson said. 
“We have to play disciplined, not 
only in penalties but within our 
system, and I’m starting to see 
more and more of that.”

Michigan falls to No. 7 Wisconsin Friday, No. 3 Minnesota Saturday

Stopping Dana Rettke is a 
tall task — both literally and 
figuratively.
No. 7 Wisconsin’s 6-foot-
8 sophomore middle blocker 
challenged No. 12 Michigan 
(18-4 overall, 7-4 Big Ten) 
all night, and the injury-
hampered 
Wolverines 
were 
unable to answer in a 25-18, 
16-25, 22-25, 25-21, 11-15 loss at 
Crisler Center on Friday night.
Rettke, the reigning AVCA 
Freshman of the Year, came 
into the match leading the Big 
Ten in attack percentage. She 
continued her efficient stretch 
on Friday by leading all players 
with a staggering .571 attack 
percentage. The 2017 First 
Team All-American selection 
guided Wisconsin (15-4, 8-3) 
to the win by committing just 
one error on 35 swings while 
putting down 21 kills.
Rettke’s height allowed her 
to take advantage of effective 
attack angles from the middle 
of the court throughout the 
match. 
When 
she 
wasn’t 
taking an approach in front of 
the setter, she was spreading 
out Michigan’s defense by 
using the slide attack — an 
approach 
style 
where 
the 
middle blocker runs laterally 
until she’s behind the setter 
and then jumps 
up off one foot. 
By approaching 
from behind the 
setter, 
Rettke 
made Michigan’s 
defense commit 
to 
double-
blocking 
one 
pin 
or 
the 
other 
before 
Wisconsin’s 
setter 
even 
released the ball.
“Our game plan to defend 
the slide and the middles in 
general was to serve the ball 
very aggressively so that they 
couldn’t set it to them,” said 
senior libero Jenna Lerg. “At 
times, we executed that very 
well. Other times, they had 
some chances and they took 
them. On the plays you can’t 
stop, you roll it back and get 
the next one.”
Midway 
through 
the 
opening set, the Wolverines 
trailed Wisconsin by three 
points. Coming out of the 
media 
timeout, 
Michigan’s 
trio of junior setter MacKenzi 
Welsh, senior outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt and freshman 
outside 
hitter 
Paige 
Jones 
spearheaded a 13-3 run to close 
the first set. At the end of the 
opening frame, Skjodt had 
nine kills on 18 swings with 
only one error, Jones had four 
kills on nine errorless swings 
and Welsh led all players with 
10 assists.
Skjodt’s nine kills in the first 
set marked the beginning of 
one of her best performances 
of the season. She finished 
the match with 27 kills, her 
second-highest tally of the 
season.
“Carly has been our most 
dominant player in all aspects 
of the game for the entire 
season,” Lerg said. “We can’t 
really try to ride her 71 swings 
against a team like Wisconsin, 
but I think she did a great job 
with those 71 attempts — she 
does everything she can to 
put the team on her back. I’m 
honored to play next to her, 
and I’m excited to see what 
else she can do this season.”
“Carly is a warrior right 
now,” Rosen added. “She’s 
definitely taking way more 
swings than we’d like and way 
more swings than she’d like. 
She’s doing everything she 
can right now. Carly’s a great 
competitor, a great leader, and 
a great volleyball player. She’s 
trying to carry as much of the 
load as possible.”
After the emphatic first-
set run, Michigan fell behind 
early in the second frame. In 
an attempt to recapture the 
momentum, the Wolverines 
took some aggressive swings — 
thus leaving them more prone 
to error. Instead of pummeling 
kills into the hardwood of 
Crisler 
Center, 
Michigan 
committed eight attack errors 
compared 
to 
Wisconsin’s 
two, and the Badgers outhit 

the Wolverines .448 to .125. 
Despite a handful of dramatic 
diving digs from Lerg, the 
Wolverines dropped the set, 
25-16.
In the third set, Michigan’s 
ineffective execution yielded 
another low attack percentage 
— this time just .049 — and 
Wisconsin took advantage once 
again. The Wolverines found 
themselves really missing the 
size and impact of two injured 
front-row 
starters: 
6-foot-3 
redshirt junior middle blocker 
Cori 
Crocker 
and 
6-foot-1 
junior opposite 
hitter 
Sydney 
Wetterstrom. 
Before 
going 
down 
with 
their 
respective 
injuries, 
Crocker 
led 
the 
team 
in 
blocks 
and 
Wetterstrom 
provided 
a 
reliable 
back-set 
option 
for 
Welsh. 
Perhaps 
most 
importantly, 
their 
court 
leadership as upperclassmen 
seemed absent in the loss 
against Wisconsin — without 
their 
presence, 
freshman 
middle blocker Kayla Bair and 
redshirt sophomore opposite 
Ellie Brooks were called upon 
in their place. Brooks and Bair 
weren’t an efficient duo on 
Friday night; they combined 
for an attack percentage of 
-.071, meaning the sum of their 
errors exceeded the sum of 
their kills.
At this point, Rosen is 
focused 
on 
how 
to 
make 
the most of what Michigan 
will be working with for the 
foreseeable future. Without 
timetables on Crocker and 
Wetterstrom, the Wolverines 
need to concentrate on how 
they can tackle their upcoming 
slate of Big Ten matches while 
they remain sidelined.
“We can’t focus on what 
we don’t have — we have to 
focus on what we have and 
how we’re going to get better,” 
Rosen said. “I look at it as 
opportunities — (Brooks and 
Bair) are having opportunities 
right now (on the court) and 
we’re 
having 
opportunities 
to develop them, but we need 
to take the opportunities. We 
can’t throw hands in the air; 

we have to get better.”
When the Badgers jumped 
out to an 8-1 lead to open the 
fourth set, Michigan spent 
most of the frame chipping 
away at the early deficit. After 
a Wisconsin coach’s challenge 
revealed a net foul on Carly 
Skjodt, the Wolverines knew 
they needed to come up with 
an answer for Rettke before 
the match slipped away.
With the end of the set 
nearing, Michigan turned to 
sophomore 
middle 
blocker 
Kiara Shannon for a handful 
of big kills. By using different 
approaches and tempos to 
set the ball to Shannon, the 
Wolverines opened up hitting 
angles around Rettke and her 
Badger counterparts. Although 
Shannon finished the match 
with just eight kills, she made 
her presence felt on defense 
by tying her career-high with 
seven blocks. Michigan battled 
back relentlessly, eventually 
trimming Wisconsin’s lead to 
just three points at 21-18.
Then, with Carly Skjodt at 
the service line, the Wolverines 
pulled off the improbable — 
Michigan won an astounding 
seven 
consecutive 
points 
while completely turning the 
momentum of the entire match 
in the process. The run was 
underscored by the sights and 
sounds of the final point of set 
four: Skjodt’s back row kill — 
which was accompanied by the 
tune of the traditional “Let’s! 
Go! Blue!” from the home 
fans in correspondence to the 
bump, set and spike — sent 
Crisler Center into a frenzy 
and forced a decisive fifth set.
But 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
demise, 
Wisconsin 
came 
out firing on all cylinders 
in the fifth set. The Badgers 
put 
together 
a 
potent 
offensive attack in the final 
frame, posting a .304 attack 
percentage in comparison to 
Michigan’s .174 clip. After a 
hard-fought battle, Wisconsin 
came 
away 
with 
a 
15-11 
victory in the tiebreaking set. 
When the dust settled, the 
Badgers’ unrivaled size and 
physicality 
triumphed 
over 
the Wolverines’ predictable 
offense.
“The bottom line is we didn’t 
have enough balance to our 
offense,” Rosen said. “We were 
way too one dimensional.”

The Wolverines fell to the Badgers after five sets on Friday.

DANIEL DASH
For the Daily

With a trio of starters sidelined 
due to injury, the No. 12 Michigan 
volleyball 
team 
(18-5 
overall, 
7-5 Big Ten) struggled to find 
consistency in a 25-27, 10-25, 20-25 
loss to No. 3 Minnesota (18-2, 12-0) 
on Saturday night.
Redshirt junior middle blocker 
Cori Crocker (ankle), junior setter 
MacKenzi 
Welsh 
(concussion) 
and 
junior 
opposite 
Sydney 
Wetterstrom (undisclosed) were 
all unable to suit up against the 
Golden 
Gophers, 
who 
came 
into the match riding a 12-game 
winning streak dating back to 
Sept. 9.
On Saturday, freshman middle 
blocker Kayla Bair and junior 
opposite 
Katarina 
Glavinic 
assumed the roles of Crocker 
and Wetterstrom, respectively, 
while the tandem of junior setter 
Katerina Rocafort and senior 
setter Maddy Abbott ran the 
offense in place of Welsh. In 
a sport where momentum is a 
driving force, the Wolverines’ 
makeshift lineup put them at a 
crucial disadvantage.
“It’s definitely a challenge, but 
I think we handled it very well,” 
said freshman outside hitter Paige 
Jones. “We just figured out this 
morning that Welsh wasn’t going 
to play, so this morning’s practice 
was when we first got our setters 
going. Rocafort hasn’t set in three 
years, but I think Abbott and 
Rocafort came in and did a great 
job in their roles and everyone 
else did a fantastic job. Everyone 
is working hard to get healthy and 
get back.”
Added Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen: “Tonight, we were forced 
into being very different. Different 
is what we were dealt, but at the 
same time, I think we need to 
focus on the way we play when we 
play well. I feel for those kids — 
they were put into a situation and 
it’s tough. Nobody wants to have 
as much unexpected change as we 
had today.”
Welsh’s injury in particular 
caused trouble for Michigan. In 
an offense that has taken a leap 
forward from last year, Welsh has 
been the puppet master behind 
the success. Her chemistry with 
senior outside hitter Carly Skjodt, 
Jones and the rest of the offense 
has helped tremendously with the 
Wolverines’ efficiency. Because 
Michigan lacks a backup setter, 

Rosen opted to use a 6-2 offense 
— a system that features two 
setters who take turns running 
the offense depending on which 
one is in the back row at a given 
moment — instead of the team’s 
usual system. On Saturday night, 
Rosen turned to Abbott, who 
has only played a limited role as 
a serving specialist this season, 
and Rocafort, who hasn’t run an 
offense in three years.
“Rocafort and Abbot had to go 
from roles they’re comfortable 
with 
to 
roles 
they’re 
not 
comfortable with,” Rosen said. 
“Rocafort hasn’t set in three years, 
and Abbott hasn’t set at all this 
year, so it’s a tough position for 
them to be in. The situation forced 
them into that, and I thought 
they did a great job. All things 
considered, they gave us what they 
had. I’m proud of them for that and 
I’m proud of our team for the way 
they handled adversity as best they 
could.”
Despite having the odds stacked 
against them, the Wolverines 
looked ready for the challenge 
coming out of the gates. Without 
Welsh at the helm, Abbott and 
Rocafort 
guided 
Michigan’s 
offense to a 20-16 lead to start 
the match. After seeing Skjodt 
take an astounding 71 swings in 
Friday night’s loss to Wisconsin, 
Jones knew that Abbott and 
Rocafort would rely heavily on her 
production against the Gophers.
“I was ready to embrace the 
pressure,” Jones said. “I know my 
teammates trust me and I know I 
trust them, so I just go out every 
game and do what they need 
me to do. Coach told us to come 
out, swing at the ball, and go for 
everything without holding back. 
It was a tough battle tonight.”
Jones did just that in an effort 
where she posted one of the best 
stat lines of her young career. At the 
end of the first set, Jones boasted a 
staggering .417 attack percentage 
after tallying 11 kills on 24 swings 
with just one hitting error.
But Michigan failed to capitalize 
on a pair of set points and a block 
by Minnesota’s Regan Pittman — 
a 6-foot-5 middle blocker — gave 
the Gophers a 27-25 victory in 
the opening frame. In addition to 
her set-clinching block, Pittman 
finished the match with 10 kills 
on just 18 swings, many of which 
came in the form of “slides” and 
“shoots” — volleyball terminology 
for shorter, faster sets to a middle 
blocker in different locations along 
the net. Pittman did most of her 
damage by utilizing a lateral, one-
legged approach from behind the 
setter.
“We try to go get out early, get 
our feet set, stop in front of them 
and take away shots so we can 
defend around it,” Jones said.
On 
Saturday, 
Pittman’s 
powerful 
arm-swing 
and 
unrivaled vertical leap proved to 
be too much for the Wolverines 
to handle. Despite being unable to 
close the set on a high note, Rosen 
was proud of his team’s execution 
in the opening frame.
“We played great in the first 
set,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“We 
were 
aggressive, we were going after it, 
and I thought our attackers were 
really going for hands and kills 
whenever they could to put the 
ball away.”
Following a closely contested 
opening set, the second frame was 

an entirely different story. The 
Gophers floored the gas pedal from 
the get-go, steamrolling Michigan 
en route to a final score of 25-10. 
Minnesota’s 
potent 
offensive 
attack delivered a .462 attack 
percentage, while the Wolverines’ 
abysmal performance led to a 
minus-.059 clip. On defense, the 
Golden 
Gophers 
out-blocked 
Michigan 6-0 in the second set 
and 14-0 during the course of the 
match.
“In the second set, we just 
flinched a little bit,” Rosen said. 
“It let a little air out of the sails 
when we couldn’t pull out that 
first set. That’s something we need 
to get better at — no matter what 
lineup is on the floor, we want to 
keep our level of energy and our 
level of execution consistent. We 
dropped down some and that was 
unfortunate.”
Although the third set was 
closer 
than 
the 
second, 
the 
Wolverines never held the lead. 
Minnesota opened the frame with 
a 4-0 spurt and never looked back. 
Perhaps the lone bright spot of the 
set was senior libero Jenna Lerg’s 
performance. Lerg finished the 
match with a team-high 19 digs 
while no other Wolverine notched 
double-figures. She also made 
her mark from the service line 
as the only Michigan player with 
multiple aces. But when it was all 
said and done, the Gophers came 
out on top, 25-20.
“After the second set, we talked 
about the fact that we have nothing 
to lose,” Jones said. “They’re 
ranked third in the nation and they 
were up two sets, so the pressure 
was on them to finish. We had 
nothing to lose so we wanted to go 
all out in the third set.”
At a glance, the numbers 
indicate 
that 
Minnesota 
was 
able to dictate the physicality of 
the match because Michigan’s 
middle blockers were ineffective 
all night long. Freshman Kayla 
Bair, filling in for Crocker, finished 
the night with a minus-.143 
attack percentage after recording 
more errors than kills. Bair’s 
counterpart, sophomore middle 
blocker Kiara Shannon, struggled 
mightily as well, posting just two 
kills on the night despite taking 16 
swings. Numbers don’t lie — the 
Wolverines lost a key facet of their 
offensive attack when it became 
evident that their middle blockers 
were having a tough time adjusting 
to Welsh’s absence.
“With two new setters, the 
hardest thing to set is anything 
quick (to the middle),” Rosen said. 
“We were trying to keep it basic 
and get good swings. I don’t think 
that was for any other reason than 
the fact that we had new players. 
We only had 45 minutes today 
to work on them connecting, 
so I think (Bair and Shannon’s 
inefficiency) was by design tonight 
to try to keep it simple.”
Once the Gophers picked up 
on this fact, Minnesota was able 
to commit two blockers to Skjodt 
and Jones on the outside pin. As a 
result, Skjodt was held to just eight 
kills on 37 swings one night after 
registering 27 kills against the 
Badgers.
Outside of Lerg’s dominant 
performance in the back row, the 
rest of Michigan’s defense had a 
tough night. Without their normal 
system in place, the Wolverines 
looked lost — communication 
errors, a new serve receive rotation 
and 
unfamiliar 
combinations 
of players prevented them from 
finding any consistency in the back 
row.
“Unfortunately, 
we 
had 
different personnel on the floor in 
different positions, so defensively, 
we dropped down as well,” Rosen 
said.
At the end of the night, 
Michigan’s 
makeshift 
lineup 
simply couldn’t get the job done 
against one of the nation’s top 
teams. With Crocker, Wetterstrom, 
and Welsh all watching from the 
bench, the Wolverines looked 
helpless when trying to provide an 
answer for an offense that boasted 
a .364 clip on the night.
“The players are doing the 
best they can, but that’s why you 
have a system,” Rosen said. “It 
helps to organize your play and 
create consistency within your 
execution. When you change the 
system at the last minute, you can’t 
expect (the execution) will stay 
the same. Tonight, we were forced 
into being very different. Different 
is what we were dealt, but at the 
same time, we need to focus on the 
way we play when we play well.”

The Golden Gophers stuffed Michigan in three straight sets.

“Carly has 
been our most 
dominant 
player.”

Skjodt needed now more than ever for ‘M’

A 
sense 
of 
dread 
crept 
through Crisler Center in the 
middle of the first set.
The 
No. 
12 
Michigan 
volleyball team faced a 14-9 
deficit to No. 7 Wisconsin, with 
seemingly no momentum or 
chance to fight back into the 
set. The Badgers had stifled 
the Wolverines’ 
attack 
to 
that 
point, 
denying 
them time and 
time 
again 
as 
they 
attacked 
through the left 
side.
Facing a top-
10 
team 
with 
injuries to two 
key 
members 
of the starting 
lineup, junior outside hitter 
Sydney 
Wetterstrom 
and 
redshirt junior middle blocker 
Cori Crocker, there was a 
feeling this one could get away 
from Michigan early.
Then, senior outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt happened.
Due to a rotation in the lineup, 

Skjodt 
started 
to 
position 
herself in the center of the court 
after beginning the game on the 
left side. This rotation sparked 
an exhilarating 16-4 run, as the 
Wolverines came back from the 
early deficit to take the first set, 
25-18.
“She’s 
been 
our 
most 
dominant player in all aspects 
of the game for honestly the 
entire 
season,” 
said 
senior 
libero 
Jenna 
Lerg. 
“She’s 
done 
a 
great 
job 
recently 
of putting the 
team 
on 
her 
back and I’m 
really honored 
to play next to 
her.”
After 
Michigan 
dropped 
the 
next two sets — 25-16 and 
25-22 — it once again felt like 
Wisconsin was closing in on 
the Wolverines, especially after 
it rallied from a 22-20 deficit 
to claim the third set with five 
straight points in a crucial 
period of the match. 
But late in the fourth set, 

with Michigan facing a 21-18 
deficit and the match on the 
line, Skjodt stepped up to serve. 
All of a sudden, the next seven 
points were in the Wolverines’ 
favor to take the set, 25-21, as 
they tied up the match going 
into the deciding set after yet 
another frantic rally spurred by 
Skjodt.
Michigan ultimately dropped 
a heartbreaker, losing the fifth 
set, 15-1. But it 
was hard to not be 
enthralled 
with 
the performance 
put on by Skjodt, 
who 
is 
coming 
off recent back-
to-back Big Ten 
Player 
of 
the 
Week honors.
Skjodt finished 
the match with 
an astounding 71 
swings on the evening, 25 more 
than the next highest total of 
46 notched by freshman outside 
hitter Paige Jones. She had 27 
kills on those 71 attempts for 
a hitting percentage of .268, 
second-highest on the team 
despite being the primary focus 
of the Badgers’ defense all 

night.
“She’s a warrior right now. 
She’s taking so many swings 
for us, way more than we’d like, 
and way more than she’d like,” 
said Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen. “She’s producing, and 
so we’ve got to get her the ball. 
To beat the elite teams, you 
have to have balance to what 
you do, and I think that Carly 
is doing everything that she can 
do right now. 
She’s a great 
competitor.”
With 
the 
recent injury to 
Wetterstrom 
and 
the 
continued 
absence 
of 
Crocker, 
the 
performance 
of Skjodt has 
allowed 
the 
Wolverines to remain in the heat 
of the Big Ten conference race 
amid a relentless schedule in 
arguably the most competitive 
conference in the NCAA.
Skjodt has been the anchor 
of the offense all season for 
Michigan, leading the team in 
total kills (302), kills per set 
(4.14) and swings attempted 
(823), all while maintaining a 
hitting percentage of .281.
The 
schedule 
only 
gets 
tougher from here on out 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
with 
upcoming road tests against 
Indiana and No. 7 Wisconsin 
before returning home to face 
Maryland and No. 9 Nebraska.
If she continues along this 
path, Skjodt will remain the 
key for Michigan in holding 
its ground against conference 
rivals.
“She’s a great leader, and a 
great volleyball player,” Rosen 
said. “She’s trying to carry as 
much of a load as she can, and 
she loves being in that role 
because she wants the team to 
win.
“It’s never about Carly, it’s all 
about ‘How can I help the team 
win?’”

‘M’ utilizes corners in 
win over Northwestern

Senior back Maggie Bettez 
crouched in the back left 
corner of Ocker Field, moving 
the ball into place as she 
prepared to put it in play. Her 
teammates lined up on the 
semicircle surrounding the 
goal as Northwestern’s three 
backs joined their goalkeeper 
in the net to defend against 
the penalty corner.
 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
ball 
left 
Bettez’s 
stick, 
the 
players sprung into action. 
Northwestern’s 
defenders 
flew 
forward, 
covering 
Michigan’s 
attackers, 
who 
quickly 
pulled the ball 
outside 
the 
circle 
before 
moving back in 
to take a shot 
on goal. The 
Wildcats 
not 
lined up in the 
net, who had 
been 
waiting 
at midfield for the ball to be 
put into play, rushed back 
into the fray.
 Penalty corners played a 
major role in the Michigan 
field 
hockey 
team’s 
3-1 
victory over Northwestern 
in the quarterfinals of the 
Big Ten tournament Sunday. 
The Wolverines (13-5 overall, 
7-1 Big Ten) earned five 
corners in each half, helping 
Michigan keep the pressure 
on 
the 
visiting 
Wildcats 
(9-10, 3-5) throughout the 
game. This also resulted in 
the majority of Michigan’s 24 
shots on goal.
 “We feel really confident 
in our offensive corners,” 
Bettez said. “It’s something 
we practice a lot, so when it 
comes time in the game, we 
just fall back on the training 

that we’ve had, and we just 
want to get it right every time. 
It’s kind of muscle memory at 
that point.”
 In field hockey, a team 
receives a penalty corner as 
a result of a foul inside the 
circle. The offensive team 
can line up as many as nine 
players; the defending team 
can only have four plus the 
goalkeeper. One player on 
offense lines up on the corner 
to put the ball in play, known 
as the insertion. Once the 
ball is inserted, it must leave 
the circle before it can be 
shot, and the players on the 
defensive team not lined up 
can run into the 
play.
 Most teams 
practice several 
different 
corners, and the 
coach will call 
a specific play 
for each corner 
depending 
on 
the 
opponent, 
the score of the 
game, the time 
remaining in the game or a 
particular player or defensive 
lineup.
 “We’re always practicing 
every day to be super precise 
with our corner execution,” 
said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “We had about four 
or five corners that we had 
planned just for Northwestern 
and we were just trying to 
execute them under pressure, 
and I thought we did a good 
job of that today.”
 
The 
Wolverines’ 
next 
game is the Big Ten semifinal 
against Iowa on Friday in 
Evanston. They will look to 
continue improving on their 
offensive efficiency and on 
capitalizing on their corners 
as they continue into the 
postseason.

Michigan hosts Big Ten Championship

At the Big Ten Singles and 
Doubles Championship over 
the 
weekend, 
expectations 
were high for the Michigan 
men’s 
tennis 
team. Last year’s 
championship 
in East Lansing 
saw the duo of 
then-freshman 
Harrison 
Brown 
and 
now-graduated 
senior 
Davis 
Crocker 
take 
the Big Ten title 
in doubles play. 
At last week’s ITA Midwest 
Regional 
Championships 
in 
South Bend, Ind. the doubles 
pairs of freshmen Andrew 
Fenty and sophomore Mattias 
Siimar, as well as junior Connor 
Johnston 
and 
senior 
Gabe 
Tishman, rode two victories 
each to the quarterfinals, while 
Fenty made the quarterfinals 
again in singles play after 
earning four wins.
“I think the guys are ready 
to go. They are deep into the 
fall now,” said Michigan coach 
Adam 
Steinberg. 
“They’ve 
competed, played and practiced 
for two months so we should be 
playing at a really high level 
right now.”
The 
tournament 
also 
provided 
the 
opportunity 
to 
test 
out 
some 
new 
combinations.
“We 
switched 
up 
our 
doubles teams so that is the one 
unknown area right now,” said 
Steinberg. “They really haven’t 
played together very much so 
that will be interesting to see.”
Both 
doubles 
teams, 
comprised of Tishman and 
sophomore Harrison Brown, as 
well as Johnston and freshman 
Patrick Maloney, earned two 
wins apiece after three rounds 
of round-robin play.
“I haven’t really played with 
(Tishman) too much but that 
was actually a lot of fun out 
there,” Brown said after an 8-2 
win alongside Tishman in the 
first round of doubles play on 

Friday. “We both bring a lot of 
energy. He likes the forehand 
side and I like the backhand 
side, 
so 
it’s 
pretty 
much 
perfect.”
Expectations were similarly 
high for singles play. “We want 
to take home the 
title. We want 
number 
one,” 
Tishman 
said. 
“We had an okay 
tournament last 
weekend but we 
want to come 
back 
to 
our 
home court and 
show 
the 
Big 
Ten what we are 
capable of.”
Despite strong performances 
from each of the four who 
participated 
in 
the 
singles 
tournament, the Wolverines 
ultimately fell short of those 
expectations. 
Tishman, 

Johnston and Maloney each 
made runs to the quarterfinals 
before 
being 
eliminated, 
logging hard-fought wins in the 
rounds of 32 and 16. Harrison 
Brown, who said he had hoped 
to make a deep run after being 
unseeded, 
bowed 
out 
in 
the 
round 
of 16 after a 
loss to Iowa’s 
Will 
Davies. 
Third-seeded 
Dominik 
Stary 
of 
Northwestern 
went on to take 
the 
singles 
title 
Sunday 
afternoon.
Although 
they 
didn’t 
walk away with a title this 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines, 
especially the underclassmen, 
felt they came away with a 

better understanding of their 
competition. “It’s good for 
them to get this experience 
to play because they haven’t 
seen the conference as much,” 
Steinberg said.
“It’s great for them to see 
what they’ll be 
up against … in 
the 
spring, 
so 
that’s 
what 
I 
like about this 
tournament.”
Added 
Tishman: 
“We 
have 
a 
young 
team, 
with 
(Schalet) 
and 
I as the senior 
captains 
and 
they’re really adapting well … 
This is Michigan, so we’re not 
satisfied with anything but 
a win. We’re really looking 
to become a family and do 
something special this year.”
