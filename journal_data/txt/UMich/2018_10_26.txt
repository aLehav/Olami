Daily 

Administration News Beat will 
be conducting interviews with 
the incumbent and challenging 
candidates 
for 
University 
of 

Michigan Board of Regents prior to 
the November midterm elections. 
Our second interview is with 
incumbent Regent Andrea Fischer 
Newman (R).

Newman is an alum of the 

University and has served on the 
board for the last 24 years. Recently 
retired, Newman was senior vice 
president of Government Affairs for 
Delta Air Lines. She has served on a 
number of boards and committees 
in her career. The regent most 
recently 
made 
headlines 
for 

connection to a potential conflict 
of interest in donations, recieving 
campaign 
contributions 
from 

donors who have ties to University 
investments. 

The Michigan Daily: You’ve 

been on the board for a decent 
amount of time and seen the 
University go through changes, so 
what made you decide to run again?

Andrea 
Newman: 
The 

University is an exciting place. It has 
been amazing to be a part of seeing 
it grow the way it has and expand 
and do all the things it’s doing today. 
There’s so much we’re doing that I 
want to see through. This isn’t a full 
time a job … It’s a lot of work but we

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Supporters and opponents debated 

the merits of Proposal A, a ballot 
measure that could throw a wrench in 
plans to build a17-story high-rise on the 

lot adjacent to the Ann Arbor District 
Library, at a forum Thursday hosted 
by the League of Women Voters. More 
than 75 people were in attendance.

Proposal A would require the lot, 

known as the Library Lot, to remain 
city-owned land in perpetuity and be 
developed as an urban park and civic 

center commons.

Will Hathaway, an Ann Arbor 

Central 
Park 
Ballot 
Committee 

member, spoke in favor of the proposal. 
He called on Ann Arbor to retain the 
Library Lot in order to make the land 
into a public park, and said the lot is 
the best candidate for Ann Arbor’s 

public square.

“Ann Arbor’s downtown lacks public 

open space — it has not been a priority 
since Liberty Plaza first opened in 
1977, over 40 years ago,” Hathaway 
said. “Even though the downtown 
population has increased, the amount 
of public open space has remained 
static.”

Hathaway said the lot, if Proposal 

A passes, could be “Ann Arbor’s own 
Diag.”

In April 2017, City Council voted in 

favor of selling the Library Lot to 
Chicago developer Core Spaces, and 
more than a year later, the city signed a 
purchase agreement for $10 million to 
allow the developer to build a 17-story 
high-rise that would include a hotel, 
apartments, office and retail space and 
an outdoor plaza.

City 
Councilmembers 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, and Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1, then sued the 
city of Ann Arbor, Mayor Christopher 
Taylor and City Clerk Jacqueline 
Beaudry, accusing them of violating 
Ann Arbor’s charter when they signed 
a 
development 
contract 
without 

consulting City Council first. The 
lawsuit is ongoing.

If Proposal A passes, it will halt the 

development proposed by Core Spaces.

Jessica Letaw, a board member of the 

Ann Arbor Downtown Development 
Authority and member of Yes In My 
BackYard, spoke on the panel against

“My Latinx is ...” event celebrates 
community through art, dance

Patrick Mullen-Coyoy reads one of his poems at the “My Latinx Is...” open mic and performance event in Hatcher Library Thursday night. The event invited 
participants to define and reflect on their own Latinx identities through performances. 

Event featuring poetry readings, music and open mic performance for identity building

Filled 
with 
music, 
food, 

poetry and dance, the “My 
Latinx is…” event Thursday 
night created a space to discuss 
and share experiences of Latinx 
identity. About 50 students and 
Ann Arbor residents attended 
the event in the Harlan Hatcher 
Graduate Library. It was hosted 
by the University of Michigan’s 
Latino/a Studies Department, 
the University Musical Society, 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs, 
La 
Casa 
and 
the 
Trotter 

Multicultural Center.

University alum Christina 

“LadyFire 
Tide” 
Perez 

moderated the event and shared 
her own poetry. The featured 
performer for the night was 
Omar 
Aragonés, 
a 
Detroit 

based musician. Silvia Pedraza, 
professor 
of 
Sociology 
and 

American Culture, was also 
present.

One 
of 
the 
participants, 

LSA sophomore Pilar O’Hara, 
shared 
a 
poem 
about 
her 

experiences with having her 
name mispronounced and made 
fun of.

“At home, after school, I 

asked my mom why she didn’t 
name me Amy,” O’Hara said. 

“On the first day of school, 
before they attempted to say 
Pilar, ‘Oh, I’m going to butcher 
this one.’”

Ann 
Arbor-based 
dance 

group Reflejos Latinos also 
performed, 
sharing 
two 

different 
types 
of 
dances 

originating 
from 
different 

regions in Latin America.

Kinesiology 
freshman 

Moisés Salgado also shared 
his poetry with the group. 
Salgado’s poetry utilized the 
metaphor of a white canvas as 
a college campus. According 
to the Office of the Registrar, 
Latinx undergraduates make up 
5.72 percent of the winter 2018 

population while white students 
account 
for 
54.62 
percent.

The

of 

Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government hosted a panel 
discussion 
on 
the 
finance 

sector and gender, continuing 
a series that highlights women 
working 
in 
traditionally 

male-dominated fields. Five 
panelists spoke to a group of 
about 30 students Thursday 
evening 
about 
working 
in 

finance in the #MeToo era and 
overcoming obstacles women 
still face in the field.

LSA 
sophomore 
Amanda

Finance, said she hoped the 
panel 
would 
enable 
young 

women to seek out mentors 
and make connections with 
women who have worked for 
notable organizations. Kaplan 
also said she reached out to 
Debotri Dhar, lecturer in the 
Women’s Studies Department, 
to moderate the panel because 
she wanted to include history 
and feminist theory in the 
discussion.

“As a woman, as someone 

new to the finance committee 
and as someone applying to 
minor in Ross, these are all 
things I’m interested in and 
I wanted to figure out a way

Linguists gathered Thursday 

for the International Institute 
Conference 
to 
discuss 
the 

endangerment and revitalization 
of Indigenous languages. The day-
long conference worked to build 
a stronger relationship between 
the University of Michigan and 
the United Nations Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues by 
reporting policy recommendation 
discussions from the conference to 
the forum.

Panelists 
discussed 
the 

relationship between technology 
and 
the 
endangerment 
of 

Indigenous languages and the 
effects of colonial legacies on 

languages, focusing on Indigenous 
languages worldwide. Experts 
in the Indigenous languages of 
China, Siberia, Mexico, India and 
the Middle East discussed their 
work, their concerns and potential 
solutions for the revitalization 
of some languages and how to 
maintain the strength of others.

Panelists debated the impact 

of technology on how languages 
survive 
and 
evolve. 
Panelist 

G.N. Devy, an Indian linguist, 
emphasized the way technology 
inhibits communication and alters 
the language and culture of a 
group.

“Having technology might lead 

to less communication,” Devy said. 
“(Languages) have defined the 
character of life of those people 
and the moment you take away 

that life the definition changes, 
(Indigenous 
peoples) 
become 

different and somebody else.”

Devy said he sees young 

children standing next to each 
other, 
texting 
rather 
than 

speaking to one another. This 
concerns him because he worries 
this technology puts languages in 
danger.

“I’m not against technology,” 

Devy said. “But voice is language 
and a lot of technology is silencing 
voice.”

In order to maintain the 

strength of Indigenous languages 
and ensure their survival, Devy 
proposed 
imposing 
monetary 

punishments on countries to 
encourage governments to work 
to maintain Indigenous languages. 
2019 was designated as the “Year 

of Indigenous Languages” 
by the United Nations, and 
Devy proposed using this 
year to begin measuring the 
presence of languages in 
countries.

With 7,000 languages 

in the world, Devy said 
he 
understands 
the 

importance of language to 
a community. He suggested 
charging countries that lose 
a language over 10 years.

“Observing the next year 

as ‘Year of the Indigenous 
Languages,’ if (a country) 
loses any language in the 
next 10 years, as recorded in 
(the country’s) census, (the 
country) has to pay,” Devy 
said.

Devy’s 
concern 

contrasted with panelist 
Colleen Fitzgerald, program 
director for Documenting 
Endangered 
Languages 

at the National Science 
Foundation. 
Fitzgerald 

sees technology as a way 
of benefitting relationships 
and communication.

Fitzgerald discussed the 

influence 
of 
Indigenous 

languages in the technological 
world. Social media platforms 
including Facebook, Instagram, 
Twitter 
and 
Whatsapp 
have 

worked to incorporate Indigenous 
languages 
into 
their 
digital 

platforms. She said Cherokee 
Nation has worked with Microsoft 
and Google to have a team of 
translators to incorporate the 
Indigenous community.

“Technology can be a vehicle,” 

Fitzgerald said. “There is a large 
digital divide in the U.S. — not 
to mention the rest of the world. 
When I talk with language 
programs that are trying to decide 
what to do next, we think about 
what you have at your realistic 
disposal.”

Fitzgerald 
also 
said 
video 

conferencing and other forms 
of technology can be helpful in 
maintaining languages.

In reference to Devy’s proposal 

to create governmental language 
policies, Fitzgerald reflected on 
the roots of language and how 
there are natural incentives and 
benefits to learning languages. She 
referenced the role language plays 
in the creation of community.

“When a community decides 

to prioritize a language to keep 
it going, it’s worth having some 
thought to incentives,” Fitzgerald 
said. “A language policy can do 
some things, but when you talk 
about communities that don’t 
have the same kinds of resources 
… there are ways that … languages 
are integrated.”

Rackham 
student 
Shalmali 

Jadhav found the correlation 
between 
technology 
and 

language survival discussed to be 
particularly concerning.

“I am worried if we depend on 

Facebook and Google to preserve 
languages (in countries) where 
capitalism is responsible (for 
language loss, we give) some 
languages a mode of survival more 
than others, which is the problem 
in the first place,” Jadhav said.

Regent Andrea Fischer Newman, running for re-election to the Board of Regents this November 

This Friday, we talked to Maya Goldman about “Broken Record,” 
her story co-authored with Nisa Khan which was published earlier 
this week. The story uncovers a SMTD student’s experiences with 
filing a Title IX complaint with the University.

“We started reporting on it the first week of classes so almost two 
months. This has definitely been my most immersive reporting project. 
I think that I’ve really learned a lot of skills for journalism in general 
throughout this process, especially learning how to build trust with 
sources on such a sensitive topic. That’s really been a valuable skill 
that came out of this process. Also this is the first time that I really feel 
like my journalism has made a difference or started a conversation in 
any real sense and that feels really cool.”

a 
finance-dominated 
field,” 

Kaplan said. “We really want 
the students to be able to 
engage with the panelists and 
create those relationships so 
that they feel more comfortable 
and empowered when they 
choose to enter the field.”

Panelists 
discussed 
the 

importance 
of 
diversity 
in 

finding 
innovative 
solutions 

to problems and the struggles 
many 
women 
face 
when 

balancing work and childcare. 
Though 
all 
panelists 
said 

bridging the gender gap in 
finance is beneficial for their 
companies, they also noted how 
filling a gender “quota” doesn’t 
fully solve the issue. Panelist 
Irena Alagic, a fixed income 
strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase, 
said diversity should go beyond 
gender to include different 
backgrounds and worldviews.

“We’re not playing a numbers 

game here,” Alagic said. “If you 
have a whole bunch of people 
in the room who all grew up 

the same way, who think the 
same way, who have the same 
set of beliefs that guide their 
principles, you’re most likely 
not going to come up with the 
most efficient decision.”

Disparities 
extend 
back 

to 
academic 
communities 

here 
on 
campus 
as 
well. 

A 
study 
published 
last 

year 
found 
women 
are 

underrepresented 
in 
senior 

positions in the University’s 
economics 
department, 
and 

make up a smaller share of 
graduate and PhD students in 
the program.

Many 
of 
the 
panelists 

also noted how the #MeToo 
movement, which has affected 
women in many different fields, 
has 
changed 
the 
discourse 

surrounding 
the 
gender 

disparity in finance. Panelist 
Charlene Reardon, the senior 
financial life adviser at Telemus 
Capital, LLC, said the issues 
exposed by the movement are 
not new but instead stem from 
a history of inequality.

“The #MeToo movement, I 

don’t think that in and of itself, 
has changed anything really 

significantly in the world of 
finance that I work in,” Reardon 
said. “It’s been an evolution, 
not a revolution.”

Business 
junior 
Sonakshi 

Agarwal said she liked how 
the panelists represented large 
companies, such as J.P. Morgan, 
and smaller ones, such as 
Telemus. Agarwal also said her 
experiences as an international 
student made her aware of how 
events in the United States 
impact other nations around 
the world.

“I come from India, and 

there is a big gender disparity 
there,” Agarwal said. “I would 
say I’ve been lucky enough not 
to experience it myself, but I 
have witnessed it and I have 
seen it in so many instances 
— workplace and even social 
life. I understand why it’s good 
that modern society is talking 
about it and if more developed 
nations like the United States 
are talking about it, the effects 
are going to trickle down to the 
rest of the world.”

meet 10 times a year, but the 
really interesting stuff comes 
in the middle when you’re 
learning and experiencing 
what the University is doing. 
You’re out on your own and 
meeting with people and 
talking to people … When 
I started on the board, the 
student 
population 
was 

about a third of where it is 
today in terms of the entering 
freshmen class … There’s just 
so much more that we can 
do that we’re sort of on the 
cusp of doing now and that’s 
what made me really do it 
again. At one point, I thought 
it’s been fantastic but there’s 
still more to do. I want to see 
us consistently ranked the 
number one public university 
in the country.

TMD: Over your career 

as regent, what goals do you 
have of the board that still 
haven’t quite been met?

AN: 
Affordability 
and 

accessibility are the two big 
ones. And you could argue 
that well, “Why haven’t you 
been working on this?” Well, 
the fact of the matter is we 
have but we’re finally now in 
a position where we’ve been 
able to raise the money. Back 
in 2004-2006, as the tuition 
started to go up because the 
state funding went down, 
I recognized that this was 
becoming 
unaffordable 

for really the middle class. 
The poor get loans and the 
wealthy can afford it, but 
it’s the middle class getting 
squeezed out of an education. 
I felt strongly that we needed 
to raise money to endow 
tuition if you will. We started 
in 2006 with the President’s 
Challenge and in the first 
year raised $90 million for 
financial 
aid. 
We’ve 
just 

raised $1.1 billion for student 
scholarships. 
It’s 
a 
great 

number but it’s not enough 
and the reason it’s not enough 
is that’s only going to throw 
off about $40 million a year. 
We need to do more to make 
education 
affordable 
and 

accessible, and that’s why I’m 
running again. My focus is on 
scholarships, raising money, 
cutting costs and making it 
affordable so that everybody 
can afford to be here who’s 
admitted because right now 
they can’t.

TMD: You’ve consistently 

opposed tuition increases, but 
how do you plan to counteract 
the efforts of the board to 
increase this amount?

AN: It’s interesting — the 

board has been effective at 
keeping the tuition increases 
lower than I think some 
might like them to be. I know 
this budget really well, and I 
know we don’t have to raise 
tuition every year. I know 
there are more creative things 
we could be doing. One thing 
I’ve learned on the campaign 
is that this is the number one 
issue and conveyed that to 
my colleagues, I said, ‘Guys, 
we live in this ivory tower 
here but I think everybody 
understands that affordability 
and accessibility are the most 
important issues ahead of us 
because we can’t price people 
out of an education.’ I think 
you’ll see change, but it is all 
about the budget. My concern 
is that we’re not pushing hard 
enough to keep the budget 
down and I will keep pushing 
… It’s hard to vote against 
these increases, but it has to 
be done.

TMD: I know an issue 

that’s been brought up by 
students and faculty in the 
regents meetings this year 
has been the issue of carbon 
neutrality and the lack of a 
set goal on the part of the 
University. Do you have any 
thoughts on this issue?

AN: The board is 100 

percent behind this initiative 
and has been. I’ve been 
talking to Prof. Kelbaugh. 
I 
know 
how 
important 

this is … The regents really 
react to students as does 
the administration. I try to 
explain this to students if 
there’s an issue, come and tell 
us about it, don’t go and sit 
and complain. 

the immigration system in the 
United States. According to 
Reed, the modern immigration 
system is rooted in an attempt 
to preserve white dominance in 
the country.

“Preservation 
of 
white 

supremacy, of white dominance, 
has always been and continues 
to be both an explicit and 
implicit 
goal 
of 
the 
U.S. 

immigration system,” Reed said. 
“Racism does not decline as 
time passes — it fluidly adjusts 
and 
aligns 
with 
prevailing 

political interests and that’s 
really something you can see 
as you trace the history of our 
immigration policy.”

During 
her 
presentation, 

Reed addressed the evolution of 
struggle that the immigration 
system has caused from the 
Civil War to the present day. 
Reed also said the problem has 
become more imminent since 
President Donald Trump took 
office.

“The 
system 
has 
always 

been bad,” Reed said. “Even 
the 
(Obama) 
administration 

made some errors in judgment. 
But this new administration 
has 
really 
weaponized 
the 

immigration 
system 
around 

larger goals of sending the 
message that white dominance 
will be preserved.”

Mentioning 
the 
common 

question 
surrounding 
the 

solution to the immigration 
problem, Reed said the thought 
process 
behind 
immigration 

must 
be 
fundamentally 

reconsidered to understand the 

extent of the subject in the U.S.

“Somebody is always going 

to ask me, ‘What is the solution 
to the problem?’” Reed said. “I 
always like to offer the idea that 
people simply move. Migration 
is not a problem to be solved — 
migration is a part of human 
existence. Saying ‘How are we 
going to solve the problem of 
immigration? We can solve it 
with walls or militarization of 
the border,’ it’s sort of like saying 
we have a hunger problem in 
America (so) how can we get 
people to stop needing to eat.”

During 
a 
question-and-

answer 
portion, 
Reed 

emphasized 
the 
difficulty 

of working in the field of 
immigration law, where she 
is responsible for overseeing 
the reunification of children 
separated from their families. 
According to Reed, it can 

be damaging for children to 
reunite with their parents after 
being split up.

“The 
children 
are 
going 

back different,” Reed said. “I 
would also say another really 
bad consequence is that the 
government took children that 
were accompanied and stuck 
them into its existing system 
for unaccompanied immigrant 
children.”

LSA senior Lisa Garcia said 

before the discussion she hoped 
it would offer information and 
resources to help aid and inform 
the immigration issue in the 
country.

“I’m actually really interested 

in 
immigration 
rights 
and 

immigrant 
communities 
in 

Ann Arbor,” Garcia said. “If 
anything, I hope to get resources 
on how we can get involved to 
promote immigrants rights in 

Michigan.”

Kinesiology 
junior 
Grant 

Floto echoed the importance of 
giving students information on 
how to get involved in the cause. 
He said the student voices are 
essential 
to 
addressing 
the 

concern of immigration in the 
country.

“I think it’s important for us 

as students especially and young 
people our age to understand 
the impact this can have on the 
future and families and younger 
kids and how we have a voice,” 
Floto said. “It’s important for 
us to work together to make 
meaningful 
impacts 
and 

especially 
with 
voting 
and 

everything 
coming 
up, 
it’s 

obviously really important for 
us to be knowledgeable about 
these things in this climate.”

Proposal 
A. 
She 
clarified 

votes on Proposal A would not 
directly alter the development 
proposal.

“The decision is not ‘Is this 

a park or is it a building?’ or 
‘Is it a great park or a great 
building?’” Letaw said. “It is, 
‘Do we hold this land in public 
for perpetuity as an urban park 
and civic center commons?’ 
That’s the question on the 
ballot.”

Letaw said any development 

on the land would have to 
include 12,000 square feet of 

space treated as a public plaza, 
in accordance with a resolution 
passed by City Council in 2014.

“We are here because for 

the last decade and a half, Ann 
Arbor residents and city staff 
and city elected officials have 
consistently said, ‘We know 
Ann Arbor is growing, we 
care very deeply about open 
space,’” Letaw said. “Part of 
the analysis of the Library Lot 
is that any sale of that land is 
required to donate 50 percent 
of the proceeds the Affordable 
Housing Fund, so we’re using 
the public process to express 
our values as a community.”

During 
a 
question-and-

answer session, Ann Arbor 
resident Vince Caruso spoke 

in favor of Proposal A and 
emphasized the need for more 
open space in the city.

“I think Ann Arbor needs a 

green space in our downtown,” 
Caruso 
said. 
“We 
need 
a 

green space where people can 
sit, meet their friends, not 
have to spend money … We 
have all these people moving 
downtown. They need a place 
to take their grandkids, to take 
their kids. It’s not so much fun 
to play in the streets in the 
downtown, I’ll tell you that.”

In a statement, the Ann 

Arbor District Library Board of 
Trustees recently announced 
its opposition to Proposal A 
“due to its potential negative 
lasting effect on the future of 
the downtown library.”

Linh Song, vice president of 

the AADL Board of Trustees, 
spoke against Proposal A. Song 
said both sides agreed on the 
need for more public space, 
but argued the library itself 
functioned as a type of public 
square.

“This is something that we 

agree on,” she said. “There 
is a need for that space. 
What I don’t agree on is that 
there should be a duplicate 
of it. If you’re talking about 
the 
Library 
Lot 
becoming 

another building, another civic 
commons, the challenge to 
the community is that if we’re 
voting for that, it means we’re 
funding it.”

one on the hand of the United 
States,” Salgado said. “This 
same hand makes up the 
percentage of brown people 
on this campus, but I would 
need twelve more of these to 
show the percentage of white 
students. Truth is each one 
of us is a brown splash. If one 
of us acts as a fool, we will all 
be critiqued, our place on the 
canvas is questioned.”

During 
Aragonés’s 

performance, he sang a few 
original songs along with a 
Pablo Neruda poem that he 
gave a twist to.

“That was a song I wrote 

a while ago, almost ten years 
ago after I lost my father,” 
Aragonés said. “He was a big 
inspiration to me.”

LSA 
senior 
Yezenia 

Sandoval, a board member of 
La Casa, attended the event 
and encouraged others to also 
attend. 

“Instead of having a La Casa 

meeting, we’re having this 

event,” Sandoval said. “We 
really wanted to encourage 
people to come because it’s 
a great celebration of our 
culture.”

In the two years since 

La Casa’s inception, there 
has been significant growth 
in 
Latinx 
organizing 
on 

campus. 
The 
umbrella 

organization now navigates 
institutional parterships and 
represents the fastest growing 
underrepresented 
minority 

group on campus. 

Toward the end of the 

event, 
Perez, 
Aragonés 

and Pedraza sat on a panel, 
shared experiences and asked 
questions of the audience. 
Perez thanked the audience 
for attending and fostering a 
welcoming Latinx community 
on campus.

“It’s been so long since I’ve 

been on campus, it means so 
much to have everybody here 
in one room,” Perez said. “To 
have the sense of community 
that everyone has created 
tonight is a really beautiful 
thing to witness. Thank you 
for allowing us to share our 
music and our poetry.”

E

verybody’s talking about 
firearms. 
“Gun 
control” 
peaked in Google’s search 
bar this year, and metal 
detectors are popping up 
faster than the October 
leaves are turning red. 
Implementation 
of 
strong security measures 
seems to be contagious 
among big cities, yet 
Ann Arbor still lacks the 
infrastructure and sense 
of urgency needed to 
make significant change. 
A greater number of 
states, cities and municipalities — 
including Ann Arbor — need to 
hop aboard the firearm security 
bandwagon in order to see true 
success in the effectiveness of policies.
Ann Arbor has a population of well 
over 100,000, and if you’ve been here 
on a Football Saturday, you know all 
too well that visitors account for a 
significant amount of the city’s make 
up. If Ann Arbor follows the lead of 
California, New York and Illinois 
— states with some of the strictest 
gun control laws — this would mean 
having metal detectors in our sports 
stadiums, bars and school buildings.
Metal detectors stand aside an 
increasingly large number of doors 
at sports and music venues. The NFL 
provided them to all of their stadiums 
in 2011, followed by the MLB and 
NHL in 2015. The NBA was even 
awarded a Safety Act certification 
from the Department of Homeland 
Security. 
College 
stadiums 
are 
implementing them as well, but 
the schools doing so are (curiously) 
Southern. Safety regulations at the 
University of Michigan’s Big House 
reflect national policies, listing guns 
and other weapons as prohibited 
items. The stadium does not have a 
bag-check policy because bags are 
prohibited entirely, and also lacks 
metal detectors at the entrance. A 
security check would take ages if the 
more than 100,000 fans at each game 
need to be screened.
The Michigan Theater, a landmark 
of downtown Ann Arbor for the past 
90 years, provides security at events 
only when deemed necessary by both 
the venue and artist.
“The objective is to make people 
feel comfortable and to be mindful of 
public safety,” Russ Collins, executive 
director and CEO of the historic 
theater, said. He explains that each 
show attracts a distinctive crowd, and 
each crowd carries a unique need for 
security — some require no security, 
while other, rowdier events have bag 
checks, metal detector wands and 
increased security personnel. Pop 

concerts and controversial speaker 
series fall into this latter category. 
Though safety at shows produces 
high levels of anxiety 
among patrons, Collins 
cannot 
remember 
a 
time that the Michigan 
Theater has had to turn 
someone away due to 
weapon possession.
Some downtown bars 
around the country are 
strengthening security 
measures. I spoke about 
this with Tom from 
Scorekeepers Sports Grill 
and Pub, a local spot that is favored by 
many University students. Normally, 
the bar has security to check purses 
and backpacks at the front door, and 
on weekends with a higher turnout 
expected, extra personnel are hired. 
When asked about a metal detector, 
Tom responded frankly that there 
is simply no room in the pub to fit a 
metal detector. Additionally, as far as 
he knows, security measures are put 
in place by the bar itself and are not 
mandated by the city of Ann Arbor.
School districts in larger cities 
have started using metal detectors 
in an attempt to prevent mass 
shootings. In Detroit, for example, 
high schoolers step through a sea of 
vigilantly monitored metal detectors 
every time they enter the building. 
April Zeoli, an associate professor 
in the School of Criminal Justice at 
Michigan State University, spoke at 
Palmer Commons this week on a 
panel regarding innovative policy as 
a preventative approach to firearm-
related violence. Zeoli explained to 
me that recently Ann Arbor Public 
Schools decided to completely ban 
guns from their campuses, regardless 
of an individual’s permit to carry a 
weapon. They were sued by opposing 
groups, but the Michigan Supreme 
Court sided with the district. 
Although the University is a different 
entity, as is MSU, gun control policies 
are still in place.
“There are absolutely no guns 
allowed 
on 
Michigan 
State’s 
campus,” Zeoli explained. “You 
cannot have them in buildings, 
dorms, classrooms — essentially, you 
can’t have them at all.” To implement 
these rules, MSU relies on the honor 
system. “It is inefficient to think 
that we can post metal detectors 
everywhere, search every backpack, 
investigate every single possible 
avenue a gun can come into a place, 
and be successful. That’s just not 
going to happen.”
Contrary to popular belief, “gun 
control” doesn’t mean confiscation 
of all firearms, but rather defines the 

movement to analyze when, where 
and why they are used. Some city-
dwellers are demanding Congress 
pass policies that could “keep guns 
out of the wrong hands” and thus 
prevent mass shootings, but others 
correspondingly argue that gun 
control laws aren’t effective. Large 
cities, including Las Vegas and 
Chicago, create controversy in the 
debate, as they are home to relatively 
tough gun control laws and still 
have high levels of gun violence — 
however, Alaska has lenient control 
policies and the highest rate of gun 
deaths in the country.
This leaves us with two scenarios. 
Maybe 
gun 
control 
laws 
are 
ineffective and are only put in place 
as a palliative measure — chronic 
gun violence in Chicago is often used 
as evidence for the ineffectiveness 
of such policies. Or, alternatively, 
gun control laws need to be more 
stringent and ubiquitous. New York 
state Sen. Brad Hoylman claims the 
state has “the strongest gun laws 
in the nation,” and this October, 
New York City celebrated three 
consecutive days without a shooting 
— a feat that hasn’t occurred in 25 
years. A city with 8.6 million people, 
and for the first time in a quarter of 
a century, no one shot each other for 
an entire weekend. A recent Johns 
Hopkins University study bolsters 
this argument — their School of 
Public Health published a meta-
analysis of 130 international studies, 
and showed that firearm legislation 
is indeed associated with fewer 
firearm-related deaths.
While several sports arenas, 
concert venues, bars and school 
districts in Ann Arbor are raising 
the bar for what they deem as 
“safe,” we still lack a city-wide 
consensus on firearm security and 
prevention in public spaces, and may 
continue to see that trend nationally. 
Unfortunately, “gun control” has 
slowly and surely become quite 
politically 
charged, 
meaning 
the entity most likely to address 
concerns is the federal government, 
not the local. A poll predicting the 
upcoming 2018 election shows that 
the country is split on how to move 
forward regarding firearm policies, 
meaning we probably will not see 
any federally-sourced policy changes 
in Ann Arbor in the near future. 
Our city has the opportunity to be 
proactive, rather than reactive, to 
potential gun violence.

Why mental health is a gendered issue
I

n the wake of high profile 
suicides 
such 
as 
designer 
Kate Spade and celebrity chef 
Anthony Bourdain, issues pertaining 
to mental illness are particularly 
relevant. It appears as though mental 
illness, long ignored as a taboo 
subject, is becoming more socially 
acceptable to discuss in public. In 
recent months, celebrities have 
spoken out more honestly about 
their own mental health struggles. 
However, despite this increased 
candor, many with mental illness 
continue to struggle in silence. In 
fact, 56 percent of American adults 
with a mental illness do not receive 
any form of treatment. Though 
disparities in access to medical 
care in the United States certainly 
contribute to this disheartening 
statistic, a lack of public awareness 
of mental illness and the stigma 
associated with it are dominating 
factors. In modern American society, 
much of this stigma comes down to 
gender lines, with gender acting as 
a major determining factor in how 
individuals experience and treat 
mental illness. The unique issues 
presented to those with different 
gender identities often obscure 
symptoms of mental illness, creating 
obstacles in recieving treatment.
In years past, the term “gender” 
was often defined to refer to physical 
anatomy in terms of genitalia and 
reproductive 
systems. 
However, 
along with the development of 
social sciences, gender has come to 
be understood as a social construct 
shaping the life experiences of all 
individuals. In the United States 
and much of the Western world, 
gender and related stereotypes have 
a profound effect on the treatment of 
mental illness.
Take, 
for 
example, 
eating 
disorders, 
particularly 
anorexia 
nervosa. 
While 
anorexia 
can 
certainly occur in individuals of 
all identities, it is drastically more 
common in young women. This 
is especially true when compared 
to young males. These extreme 
differences can largely be accounted 
for when social gender standards are 
taken into account. In countries of 
the Western world, anorexia nervosa 
and bulimia nervosa are more 
prevalent than in developing nations. 
These same Western nations are also 
more likely to be bombarded with 
a 24-hour news cycle. This cycle 
includes television programming, 
advertisements and print sources 
such as magazines. In such media, 
the so-called “thin ideal” for women, 
in particular, is almost inescapable. 

Women in leading roles on scripted 
television shows, reality shows and 
news programs often fit into this 
ideal. If they do not, their weight 
is often frequently discussed or 
becomes central to their identity 
— as a character or a public figure. 
Magazines targeted toward women 
often tout “success stories” of 
extreme weight loss or particular 
diets that can produce the perfect 
body. Studies show that frequent 
exposure to the thin ideal can lead 
to its internalization within young 
women, making them more prone to 
eating disorders.

Conversely, men and boys suffer 
from similar gender standards 
when it comes to eating disorders. 
Though it is much less common, it 
is certainly not unheard of for males 
to develop anorexia or bulimia. 
Moreover, when such disorders do 
present themselves in men or boys, 
the associated stigma is often far 
greater than it is for women and 
girls. Males with eating disorders 
experience what is known as a 
“double stigma”, or feelings of shame 
for having a mental disorder in the 
first place, and then increased shame 
for said disorder’s association with 
femininity.
Additionally, gender standards 
associated 
with 
masculinity 
typically involve an intense norm 
of self-reliance or the idea that a 
“real man” would not need outside 
support for emotional issues. This 
is a stereotype that has proven 
to be especially harmful to men 
and boys. Gender differences in 
suicide epidemiology support this. 
According to statistics put forth 
by the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention, men are nearly 
four times as likely to die by suicide 
than women are. Furthermore, 
men are much more likely than 
women 
to 
self-medicate 
their 
mental illnesses with drugs and 
alcohol, often leading to potentially 
lethal substance abuse disorders. 
This behavior is often in place of 
seeking professional psychological 

help, which women tend to be more 
likely to do than men. Damaging 
standards of masculinity, such as 
the notion that “boys don’t cry” — or, 
the “man up” mentality — can lead 
to the stigmatization of men and 
boys expressing their emotions, even 
from young ages. Such standards, 
in turn, create societal norms in 
which males must internalize their 
emotions to maintain an aura of 
toughness.
Beyond 
the 
United 
States, 
gender 
issues 
within 
mental 
illness cause significant hardships. 
Worldwide, 
women 
experience 
unipolar depression at a rate 
twice that of men. This may be 
because women are more likely to 
experience gender-based violence, 
socioeconomic disadvantages and 
stronger responsibility for the care 
of dependents than men. Such 
pressures, along with an increased 
risk of sexual violence victimization, 
create scenarios in which women 
are more likely to experience 
mental illness. These factors are all 
strictly social in nature, resulting 
from enduring gender stereotypes 
that prevent women on the whole 
from 
becoming 
economically 
independent, normalize violence 
against women and place undue 
stress upon women to care for 
children 
and 
other 
vulnerable 
populations.
It is clear that mental illness 
is reaching a crisis point globally. 
With suicide rates sharply rising 
nationwide, 
mental 
illnesses 
are preventing Americans from 
living their daily lives and causing 
significant disability. This rings 
particularly 
true 
for 
college 
students. College students now face 
more crippling levels of depression 
and anxiety than ever before. 
Many students are falling victim 
to the same gender standards 
and expectations detailed above, 
as well as immense pressure to 
succeed from a variety of outlets. 
Additionally, many colleges have 
proven themselves to be unable to 
support their struggling students, 
causing many to suffer needlessly 
and endlessly. When it comes down 
to it, the global mental health crisis 
is largely a result of arbitrary gender 
stereotypes 
forcing 
individuals 
into certain roles, and as a society, 
we have proven to be powerless in 
providing any real solution.

Will we see gun restrictions in Ann Arbor?

Tribalism degrades civil discourse
I

n my AP English class, my 
teacher, in an attempt to 
broaden our perspectives, 
talked to us about 
different 
“lenses” 
literary critics use in 
their writings, such as 
feminism, 
Marxism 
and 
psychoanalysis. 
Often in class, when 
discussing something 
we had read, like “The 
Road” 
by 
Cormac 
McCarthy or Yann 
Martel’s “Life of Pi,” it 
seemed easy to notice 
what 
lenses 
my 
classmates 
were 
“wearing.” 
These 
perspectives just provided a 
base for understanding ways 
to think. My teacher’s most 
important lesson, however, was 
to encourage us to identify what 
lenses we had on ourselves and 
to encourage us to think freely. 
If we are to consider ourselves 
thoughtful, we must recognize 
and resist the temptation to 
view the world with only one set 
of glasses, whichever color. This 
includes if the bias is based on 
ideology, personal experience 
or influence, etc.
Pigeonholing someone else 
by labeling them as “Democrat,” 
“Republican,” “fascist,” “racist,” 
“communist” or whatever else is 
a serious problem and closes one 
off to opposing and challenging 
ideas. A problem just as serious 
is limiting oneself to a label like 
this and letting identities like 
these dominate one’s thought. 
Party affiliation has turned into 
“tribalism.” It is now “a form of 
personal identity that reaches 
into almost every aspect of our 
lives.” It has permeated, for 
many people, into their personal 
relationships 
and 
degraded 
respectful conduct into mob 
mentality.
For 
many, 
the 
anger 
in 

Washington, D.C. and on the 
news is appalling. Others also 
try to justify it. A video of Eric 
Holder this month 
saying “When they 
go 
low, 
we 
kick 
them,” surfaced on 
the 
internet. 
This 
statement 
was 
a 
play-on 
of 
former 
first 
lady 
Michelle 
Obama’s “When they 
go low, we go high.” 
Unfortunately, 
the 
standard 
of 
what 
“low” is has now 
changed. Now, “going low” means 
someone else acting on beliefs 
which are contrary to one’s own. 
This was explained very clearly by 
the last Democratic presidential 
candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton 
when she said, “You cannot 
be civil with a political party 
that wants to destroy what you 
stand for.” A former presidential 
candidate, not only condoning, 
but encouraging incivility in our 
political discourse is dangerous 
and irresponsible.
As a result of tribalistic 
political identification, people 
are no longer thinking logically, 
but are instead deciding to 
indulge in a battle to the death 
over politics. Gone are the days 
of men like Antonin Scalia, who 
said, “I attack ideas. I don’t 
attack people. And some very 
good people have some very 
bad ideas.” Justices Antonin 
Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
though as ideologically different 
as a goat and a cheetah are 
different biologically, were great 
friends over the years. They are 
also highly-regarded role models 
for each of their respective 
political parties. Unfortunately, 
their example is not being 
followed.
I’m sure plenty of members of 
Congress are friends regardless 

of their party affiliation, but 
that is no longer politically 
expedient for them. Because 
of growing anger among those 
in the media and the general 
population, stronger and harsher 
statements from our politicians 
about their colleagues and their 
ideas gets them the publicity 
they seem to so desperately 
want. Senator Lindsey Graham, 
R-S.C., 
with 
applause 
from 
many Republicans, announced 
after the confirmation of now-
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that 
he would — for the first time 
ever — campaign against his 
Democratic colleagues in the 
Senate.
Many 
Democrats, 
rightly 
so, were and are upset by some 
of President Donald Trump’s 
comments since he started his 
campaign for the presidency, 
which have often crossed the 
line. Those elected to office 
should exemplify the highest 
ideals of this country. But the 
reaction of the left now has 
betrayed 
Michelle 
Obama’s 
words, which she felt the need 
to restate recently. Politicians 
are being confronted at their 
homes, in restaurants and on 
their way to work. This conduct 
is disgusting. Banging on the 
doors of the Supreme Court 
and screaming in the Senate 
Chamber is disgusting. Threats 
and insults hurled at politicians 
on either side are disgusting. 
Those who confronted Rep. 
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., this 
week calling her a communist 
and screaming expletives at her 
acted disgustingly.

Males must 
internalize their 
emotions to 
maintain an aura 
of toughness


This is it. It’s really happening. 

The never-before-accomplished 
think piece about the massive 
impact 
the 
“Harry 
Potter” 

series has had on basically every 
millennial to ever pick up a book 
— with the exception of the 
middle schoolers “too cool for 
magic.”

Jokes aside, “Harry Potter”’s 

cultural impact is essentially 
unparalleled in today’s world; 
millions 
upon 
millions 
of 

children have had the same exact 
experience I did, falling madly 
in love with the boy wizard’s 
story, feeling the excitement of 
midnight releases and growing 
up with him and his friends. I 
wish I were kidding when I say 
that I have been Harry Potter for 
Halloween (in multiple different 
iterations, including Quidditch 
attire) going on 12 years this 
season. The bottom line is that I 
would be a drastically different 
human had it not been for J.K. 
Rowling’s brilliant mind.

For the sake of brevity (I 

once wrote a full research 
paper about the impact of J.K. 
Rowling’s literature / charity 
work when I was 14, and I’ll be 
sure to publish it if I ever find it), 
I’m going to focus on the impact 
of Rowling’s very first novel 
“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s 
Stone,” and why I can’t get 
through the first few sentences 
without tearing up: “Mr. and 
Mrs. Dursley, of number four, 

Privet Drive, were proud to say 
that they were perfectly normal, 
thank you very much. They were 
the last people you’d expect to 
be involved in anything strange 
or mysterious, because they just 
didn’t hold with such nonsense.”

Normalcy, 
as 
a 
social 

construct, 
has 
plagued 
my 

existence from a very young 
age — not that I even began 
to understand why I deviated 
from the norm until I was about 
17, but the fact of the matter is 
that I am very, very gay, and the 
signs were very, very obvious 
from as far back as I remember. 
Internalized homophobia was 
so deeply ingrained in me by my 
family and school that I refused 
to fully face this truth until I had 
moved away from home. Which, 
frankly, is really fucked up. But 
I digress.

Anyway, I wasn’t “normal,” 

and everyone knew it but refused 
to understand. And because I, 
too, refused to understand, I 
lashed out by being “different” 
in other ways: I listened to pop 
punk and screamo, made short 
films with friends, did a little 
acting in middle school and, of 
course, read too many books. 
My mother often reminded me 
that I was “too contrarian” and 
even went so far as to say I “have 
issues with authority” when I 
was kicked off my high school 
tennis team.

Now at 21, I think this opening 

paragraph is exactly why I have 
always clung to the “Harry 
Potter” novels like my Catholic 
family has clung to their Bibles. 
From 
the 
very 
beginning, 

Rowling makes it clear our 
protagonist isn’t normal. He’s 
quiet, he doesn’t have friends, 
weird things happen around 
him, hell, his own foster family 
hated him for the very fact that 
they know he isn’t a regular 
boy. And Harry’s otherness, his 
mistreatment, his invisibility 
echoed in my empty little frame 
(and still does if we’re being 
honest). Then he’s whisked away 
from his torturous existence 
with four simple words spoken 
by 
a 
giant 
groundskeeper: 

“You’re a wizard, Harry.”

I quite literally got on my 

knees and prayed to God every 
night leading up to my 11th 
birthday that my Hogwarts 
acceptance letter would arrive. 

Obviously this never happened, 
but I never stopped holding 
on to Harry’s story. Harry 
learned how to be a real wizard, 
adjusting to a new culture and 
way of life at only 11-years-old by 
making friends and forming his 
own family at Hogwarts. “Harry 
Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” 
helped me understand that it’s 
OK to choose your family, to 
start over and find happiness 
outside the nuclear family unit, 
and it’s even better when that 
family is comprised of those who 
are othered like you: a famous 
orphan, a genius with muggle 
parents and a loyal friend whose 
large family has to spread their 
earnings thin.

This isn’t to say that my family 

is evil; far from it, actually, 
when compared to Voldemort’s 
burning hatred for the minority 
groups 
of 
the 
wizarding 

world. Despite a slightly rough 
upbringing, 
they’ve 
been 

almost entirely supportive of 
everything I’ve attempted to 
accomplish. Yet, I do feel less 
suffocated since I’ve moved 
away. I think of all the smiles 
Harry flashes, the amazement he 
expresses with each discovery 
of his new life, and I think about 
how closely it has paralleled my 
own experiences flying away 
from my nest of white suburbia. 
I also think about how badly 
I wanted to feel the same way 
at 11, at 14 and especially at 17, 
when the real me wasn’t having 

the best time being tucked away 
for so long.

“Harry Potter” shaped me 

in ways that are often hard to 
put into words, and while gays 
might not have magic powers 
(or do we?), I can say for certain 
that I’m a braver person for the 
lessons I’ve learned — someone 
more 
comfortable 
with 
my 

place in this world and more 
empathetic for those who have 
felt the same. I could write a 
whole other article on Hermione 
Granger alone, but for now, I’m 
going to thank “the boy who 
lived” for helping me cope with 
being different, and for taking 
Dumbledore’s advice to heart: 
“It does not do to dwell on 
dreams and forget to live.”

BTBU: ‘Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone’

A sense of rebellion is woven 

deeply into the American identity. 
While the last 250 years have 
proven that the people of the United 
States and their government have 
become experts at maintaining the 
status quo, there is still a part of our 
national identity that celebrates 
the notion that to be “American” 
is to react against something, 
sometimes against the institution of 
America itself. This was especially 
prevalent during the 20 years of 
the Vietnam War, a period during 
which political turmoil directly 
danced 
with 
massive 
cultural 

upheaval and rebirth. The center 
of this change rested squarely 
in the hands of varied social and 
political movements of the time, 
which leaned heavily on artistic 
expression and colored the Vietnam 
era with poignant commentary on 
its realities. In the face of death, 
confusion and the stagnant trudge 
of war, American counterculture 
paved a path through the muck by 
creating music that would last the 
test of time.

The political background of the 

Vietnam War was complicated 
and messy, the combination of 
a society entrenched in anti-
Communist rhetoric and the need 
to display American strength on an 
international scale. Lasting from 
1955 to 1975, the period during 

which Vietnam affected U.S. society 
spanned two decades and resulted 
in tens of thousands of American 
and Vietnamese casualties, leaving 
the nation at a loss for what the war 
truly meant in a historical context. 
To some, it was to establish stable 
democracy and eliminate Chinese 
influence in a new and warring 
nation. To others, the reason for 
conflict in Vietnam was obscure, 
a long-lasting fight that had no 
clear goal or end in sight. Though 
the older and more conservative 
generations maintained their belief 
in the war’s necessity, their voices 
were largely unrepresented in the 
artistic movements of the time. 
Country music artists like Merle 
Haggard remained supportive of 
the government throughout much 
of the war, but in comparison to 
the popularity of countercultural 
anthems, its pro-America messages 
were overshadowed.

Initially, the war gained support 

from a majority of Americans, but as 
time went on and deaths mounted, 
the national perspective began to 
shift toward ambivalence, while 
the massive population of nearly 80 
million young Baby Boomers kicked 
an anti-war effort into gear. The 
impetus of anguish for this youth 
movement was only exacerbated by 
the military draft, sending college 
campuses and urban centers across 
the country into action. With this 
action, the American tradition 
of rebellion was represented in 
their music, a medium by which 
communication 
was 
possible 

through the visceral power of song. 
These tunes would become the face 
of a generation and a period of time 
alike, framing the unrest of an era 
with songs heavy with soul and a 
timeless message of change against 
all odds. The spirit of freedom to 
fight for one’s beliefs continued in 
the hearts of musicians and fans 
alike during the Vietnam era, a 
protest for peace that continues to 
affect the country’s music today.

Before 
the 
Vietnam 
War’s 

influence truly reached American 
society, protest music was already 
in full force in response to the Civil 
Rights movement of the late ’50s 
and early ’60s. Artists like Joan 
Baez, Bob Dylan and Simon & 
Garfunkel stood at the forefront of 
the early folk music revival scene, 
which grew out of New York City’s 
Greenwich Village and into the 
ears of listeners across the country. 
Baez’s song “Birmingham Sunday,” 
among 
others, 
displayed 
the 

struggles of the battle for civil rights 
in America, while outstretching a 
hand for others to join the cause 
through the simplicity and bare-
bones style of folk music itself. 
The genre at its root was forged 
in the working man’s toils, so it 
was only natural for its sound to 
carry a message of empowerment 
and social awareness in a time of 
political uneasiness. When the 
war’s effects became more and 
more apparent in folk’s strongholds, 
the music began to reflect anti-
war sentiment and a painfully true 
commentary on the war’s effects on 

both soldiers and those still at home. 
From this, music like Dylan’s iconic 
song “Blowin’ in the Wind” was 
born, stamping a permanent mark 
in U.S. music history while fueling 
the debate around the war’s obtuse 
purpose and seemingly senseless 
violence. The message of folk 
music from that time was a clear 
analysis of what the international 
destruction of Vietnam meant in the 
context of already existing domestic 
turmoil, calling the listener to look 
deeper into the superficial peace of 
daily life to see a system in need of 
change.

While folk music colored much 

of the early ’60s protest songs, 
the anti-war message began to 
shift into rock and psychedelia as 
counterculture merged with many 
of the time’s youth movements. 
Protests 
erupted 
across 
the 

country in areas with high youth 
populations, only heightened by the 
massive scale of the Baby Boomer 
generation. 
Buffalo 
Springfield, 

then Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 
and Creedence Clearwater Revival 
merged rock with the organic 
sound of folk, creating music with 
a direct and piercingly honest core. 
They highlighted the realities of 
government oppression in songs like 
“Ohio,” which commented on the 
Kent State Massacre of four student 
protesters in 1970, and “Fortunate 
Son,” a meditation on the inherent 
inequalities of the war’s draft lottery 
system that became the unofficial 
anthem of the anti-war effort. The 
pop rock ‘n’ roll of the ’60s shifted

Stop! What’s that sound?: How the 
Vietnam War changed music forever

B-SIDE SECONDARY

into a darker, grittier version of 
itself in response to the political and 
social conflict of popular culture, 
with bands like The Beatles and the 
Rolling Stones moving into more 
experimental territory with albums 
such as Revolver and Let it Bleed. 
This edgier side to rock has stayed 
put since, becoming the standard 
for the genre as time has gone on.

But the image most have of 

the Vietnam era is of the hippie 
counterculture, 
of 
Woodstock 

’69 and Jimi Hendrix smashing 
guitars. This too was a response 
to the period’s social discord, as 
thousands of young, largely white 
and middle-class Americans joined 
the movement to embrace free 
love. They gathered at festivals 
like Monterey Pop to communally 
celebrate their music while joining 
hands 
against 
the 
negativity 

and confusion of wartime. The 
hippies were the face of that 
counterculture, especially in light 
of the drug culture that wove its 
way into their art and practices. 
They were not protesters, but rather 
purveyors of a peaceful mentality 
supported by pacifism and a kernel 
of ignorance. Psychedelic drugs like 
LSD influenced both the spiritual 
aspects and creative approach of 
the hippie movement, producing 
bands like Jefferson Airplane and 
the Grateful Dead’s whimsical 
sound. As the war reached its peak 
in the early ’70s and devolved, so 
did the hippie counterculture and 
its popularity, leaving its style and 
music behind as many devotees 
descended into drug abuse or left 
the movement altogether. The 
“Summer of Love” in 1967 was 
arguably the climax of “free love” 
culture, a community assemblage 
that 
celebrated 
their 
customs 

and ideology. From there, hippie 
neighborhoods like San Francisco’s 
Haight-Ashbury district lost their 
glory quickly, leaving their music 
and aesthetic appeal as a lasting 
token of the movement’s ideals and 
highest achievements. 

While folk, rock and psychedelia 

created the sound of an era for 
white America, Black soul and blues 
artists also continued their own 
path against the social tumult of the 
’60s and ’70s. Artists such as Marvin 
Gaye brought Motown and other 
R&B labels into the political sphere 
with records like 1971 release What’s 
Going On, the title track of which 
became a timeless representation of 
that era and others like it. “Father, 
father,” Gaye sings, “We don’t need 
to escalate / You see, war is not the 
answer / For only love can conquer 
hate.” These lyrics, among others 
from the period across every genre, 
show the universal application of 
protest and politically conscious 
art throughout time. “What’s Going 
On” could easily have been written 
today, or post-9/11, or during the 
HIV / AIDS epidemic in the ’90s. 

The political tenor of the Vietnam 
War’s music remains a large part 
of American pop music today, 
specifically in the darker, more 
direct themes seen in rock and 
folk music of the modern age. The 
generation that popularized this 
time’s most lasting music was huge, 
millions and millions of people born 
after WWII that brought the spirit 
of protest from their youth into the 
future and passed it along to their 
children. Overall, the themes of 
Vietnam era music are relevant in 
any time period, and a combination 
of poignant messages, truly great 
arrangement and the commitment 
of those who loved it to keep the 
melody in the public eye for decades.

It could be argued that the 

political turmoil of today’s Trump 
administration could offer the 
same fodder for musical and artistic 
development that the Vietnam 
War did, but the issue is slightly 
more complex. In the Vietnam 
era, the anti-war effort was easy 
to understand even if the purpose 
of the war wasn’t, and it gave the 
counterculture 
the 
opportunity 

to unite against a clear force. The 
Civil Rights Movement and Second-
Wave Feminism intermingled with 
this counterculture, but the goal of 
counterculture’s music was more 
crystalline than it is today. In 2018’s 
political climate, the issues with 
American government and society 
are 
increasingly 
complex 
and 

abstract. Activism has burst into the 
mainstream in response to this, and 
with it the message of “sticking it 
to the man” that much of Vietnam-
age music carried is almost not 
enough. The messages of that time 
have become commonplace in 
rock and folk, an expected edge to 
each genre that originated in the 
protests and festivals of the ’60s 
and ’70s. In its place, the protest 
music of today looks different, 
and elicits a different feeling than 
those songs: artists like Beyoncé, 
Childish Gambino and Kendrick 
Lamar have taken political action 
into rap and pop music, creating a 
new generation of activists that will 
hopefully continue the message just 
as those in the Vietnam era did. But 
the real question lies in whether 
the widespread political agendas 
of today’s musicians will become 
diluted in their commonality, or 
present a real chance to make 
change in America. If the effect of 
Vietnam’s music is any indication, 
connecting via art may hold the 
key to forming a community to flip 
the script of modern politics. But it 
is up to the listeners to take it into 
their own hands: Vietnam changed 
American music forever. Could the 
modern struggles of today’s political 
landscape change it for the better 
again?

Just as NBC’s ’90s “Must See 

TV” era was defined by an array 
of nearly identical shows about 
young singles, ABC’s comedy 
programming in the 2010s is 
on track to be remembered as a 
gaggle of nearly identical sitcoms 
about families. Since the massive 
success of “Modern Family” in 
2009, ABC has consistently added 
more family-centric shows to their 
lineup, to the point where they are 
abundant enough to fill their own 
programming block.

While initially charming, the 

families have increasingly become 
predictable. An “ABC Family” (no 
pun intended) will be large and 
loud with an overbearing (but 
well-meaning) mother, a cool 
child, a nerdy child, maybe a quirky 
grandparent and so on. Recently, a 
new twist was conceived: take the 
same formula and add nostalgia. 
Normally, a show’s cohesion to 
the existing brand of the network 
is a good sign. Saying that “The 
Kids Are Alright” fits in perfectly 
should be a compliment to the 
show, but, alas it is not.

“The Kids Are Alright” centers 

around the humongous Cleary 
clan. They are Catholic, brash, 
politically-incorrect 
and, 
with 

eight sons rounding out the family, 
the testosterone is practically 
oozing from the screen. None of 

these characteristics should come 
as a surprise, as the series comes 
from showrunner Tim Doyle 
(previously credited with shows 
like “Roseanne” and “Last Man 
Standing”). The show follows 
the family as they navigate the 
turbulent social climate of the 
early ’70s. “The Kids Are Alright” 
sets lofty goals for 
itself, 
promising 

to 
deliver 
ample 

characterization 
for each of the the 
10 members of the 
family, as well as 
picking 
a 
setting 

wherein much can 
be 
unpacked 
and 

paralleled to today. 
The show fails to 
deliver 
on 
both 

accounts.

In the pilot episode, we are 

introduced to protagonist Timmy 
(Jack Gore, “Ferdinand”), the 
middle child of the bunch. And 
in typical middle child fashion, 
his entire storyline involves going 
to dire straits to be noticed by 
his parents. His attention-deficit 
disorder reaches a fever pitch 
upon the return of his eldest 
brother Lawrence (Sam Straley, 
“Chicago P.D.”) from seminary. 
Desperate for someone to notice 
him, Timmy establishes a phony 
charity to raise enough money to 
pay for an audition for a theatre 
troupe. The B-plot centers around 
Lawrence’s struggle to tell his 

father that he does not want to 
pursue the priesthood, and has 
no idea what he wants to do 
with his life anymore. Despite 
having a story that is centered 
around two characters’ very real 
struggles, none of the characters 
felt any more familiar by the end 
of the episode than they did at the 

beginning.

It was a mistake 

for the pilot to 
focus so fervently 
on 
Tommy 
and 

Lawrence. 
While 

entertaining 
and 

definitely 
funny, 

it 
greatly 
lacked 

exposition. For a 
show that marketed 
itself 
for 
being 

about such a large 

and crazy family, there was an 
expectation that viewers would 
be able to get to know a little about 
them. By the episode’s close, it is 
only revealed that Eddie (Caleb 
Foote, “American Horror Story”), 
the second eldest, has a girlfriend, 
one of the brothers is a big tattle-
tale and another happens to be a 
bit quieter. Introductions could 
have been as simple as a fast-
paced montage to familiarize the 
audience with each one of the 
brothers. While it is impossible 
for each brother to have a majority 
stake in the plot in every episode, 
the show needs to find some 
middle 
ground 
between 
that 

possibility and the feeling that the 

other brothers are just filler.

In 
fact, 
many 
elements 

of the show feel like filler, 
particularly 
the 
backdrop. 
If 

“The Kids Are Alright” is a semi-
autobiographical look at Doyle’s 
life, it should not feel as hollow as 
it does. The lighting, set design and 
costumes are all clearly executed 
to perfection, and the music 
selection is sublime. However, 
this is not a proper substitute for 
zeitgeist or heart. Multiple times 
in the episode, characters vaguely 
refer to the “changes” happening 
all around them. With so many 
“changes” being alluded to, it 
felt like a let-down that the only 
subversive conversation on-screen 
was a talk between father and son 
about the importance of a college 
degree and a half-baked reference 
to women maybe being able to 
make their own decisions.

Who knows? It is only the first 

episode. Maybe over time, “The 
Kids Are Alright” can challenge 
itself to identify and question the 
parallels between issues back 
then and issues now. Hopefully, 
the show can elevate itself out of 
the niche of shallow nostalgia. 
This is particularly important, 
because the thing about shallow 
nostalgia — especially for a period 
as regressive for the rights of 
marginalized groups as the early 
’70s — is that rather than coming 
across as a wistful look to the 
past, it appears more like a plea to 
return to it.

The envelope handed to me 

at will-call bore the inscription 
“ROBERT 
MANSUETTI, 

PHOTO,” 
much 
to 
my 

excitement. Walking through the 
blunt Michigan cold to the back of 
the line which wrapped around 
Royal Oak Music Theatre, I tore 
open the flap to be greeted by a 
bona fide physical concert ticket 
(an increasing rarity in the world 
of Ticketmaster) and a red and 
white photo pass channeling the 
same design of a “Hello my name 
is” tag.

Here to see Kali Uchis for her 

penultimate stop on the “In Your 
Dreams” tour, it was only my 
fourth concert ever. I flirted with 
thoughts of how I could wield 
the new power that my title of 
press photographer grants me 
as I tromped down the steps of 
the tiered venue. The closest I 
came to anything resembling 
photography last Sunday night 
was a few customary iPhone 
videos 
and 
Instagram 
story 

updates — meager means of 
capturing the magic of the main 
event.

Opener 
Gabriel 
Garzón-

Montano came out with an 
eerie, stuttering gait, which I 
initially thought was part of his 
persona. I felt bad when the tall 
person in front of me ducked to 
the right and I realized he was 
using a cane. He overstayed his 
welcome just a tad as he sang 
and strummed through a grab-
bag of his greatest hits to an 
unacquainted audience, the only 
of which I recognized was “6 8” 
due to its sampling in a Drake 

song. At the end of his set, he tore 
his tank top off, threw it into the 
puzzled faces on the floor and 
sauntered off stage left.

The 
live 
musicians 
soon 

filed in and the opening notes 
of “Dead To Me” were heard 
shortly after. With the lights off, 

crowd on their toes and breezy 
guitar riffs in the air, the sudden 
appearance of Kali’s silhouette 
was immediately arresting, the 
fans entirely captivated as she 
strutted out from behind the 
curtain into many a fierce pose.

“I don’t know what you’ve 

been told,” she sang in unison 
with hundreds of voices: some 
rough, some smooth, some flat 
and some sharp, but all dead 
set on joining her on a mystical 
medley through her stellar studio 
debut 
Isolation 
interspersed 

with the best of her Por Vida EP. 
Easily danceable tracks like “Just 
a Stranger,” “Feel Like A Fool” 

and “After the Storm” kept the 
energy vivacious, allowing for 
slower, more sober reflections in 
“Killer” and “Flight 22.”

We were with her all the 

way, some more enthralled than 
others but all gleefully swept into 
the pull of typhoon Kali Uchis. 
While revealing herself to be 
a secret introvert in her short 
monologues (she prefixed a heart-
wrenching rendition of “Loner” 
with “I’m the type of person who 
doesn’t like to talk to people”), 
Uchis 
made 
herself 
known, 

staying in constant motion the 
entire show, swaying, twirling 
and sashaying in a lustrous red 
outfit reminiscent of the one she 
sports on the Isolation cover.

Nowhere was her mesmerizing 

presence felt more than when 
Kali transitioned to a cover of “I 
Feel Love,” convincing me that 
her sophomore effort should be 
an eclectic modern take on disco. 
For the few concerts I’ve been to, 
there’s been a stellar track record 
with covers — Lorde doing 
Frank Ocean’s “Solo,” Kesha 
doing Dolly Parton’s “Jolene” 
— and Uchis channeling Donna 
Summer in the best way possible 
was no exception.

Even though the live band 

didn’t particularly do the sublime 
production of Isolation justice 
(the losses of Tame Impala’s 
Kevin Parker and Gorillaz’s 
Damon Albarn were particularly 
felt on “Tomorrow” and “In 
Your 
Dreams,” 
respectively), 

they were still impressive in 
their own right and Kali did 
more than enough to spellbind 
us for a little over an hour. With 
lithe movements and high notes 
abound, Kali Uchis put it all out 
there on that stage, leaving us 
simply bewitched.

CONCERT REVIEW

INTERSCOPE RECORDS

There is something about 

a live concert that is superior 
to the canned feel of any other 
form of music. Unlike recorded 
music, a live performance can 
never be repeated in the same 
way. This feeling is exemplified 
by the performances from 
the University’s orchestras. 
The University is home to 
one of the top conducting 
programs 
in 
the 
United 

States 
and 
the 
conductors 

and orchestras hold true to 
this 
title. 
Each 
University 

Orchestra 
performance 
is 

unique and special in its own 
fashion, presenting beautiful 
music from one of the greatest 
University orchestras in the 
country.

The experience of watching 

the 
University 
orchestras 

perform is unlike any other, 
given that they include fellow 
students who are also some 
of the nation’s best orchestral 
musicians.

This coming Sun. at Hill 

Auditorium, 
the 
University 

Philharmonia, in conjunction 
with 
three-fifths 
of 
the 

University 
Symphony 

Orchestra, 
will 
present 

their 41st annual Halloween 
Concert.

The University Orchestras’s 

Halloween Concert is unique 
to 
other 
performances 
in 

that in addition to orchestral 
music, the group performs 
skits and dances, and they 
give out candy during classical 
pieces. Additionally, the entire 

orchestra and its conductors 
perform in full costume. The 
audience 
is 
encouraged 
to 

attend in costume as well.

The 
Halloween 
Concert 

is 
a 
University 
Orchestra 

tradition, 
having 
been 

initiated by conductor Gustav 
Meyer in 1977. Each iteration 
has a secondary theme. This 

year, the theme is “Michigan 
Sports,” as the University’s 
football 
team 
is 
doing 

immensely well. The theme 
will be present in some of the 
chosen costumes as well as the 
pieces selected to be played.

Historically, the Halloween 

Concert has been a medium 
used to connect students to 
the music and to one another. 
Given that the concert is 
set for the afternoon of Oct. 
28, it serves as the perfect 
opportunity to kick off the 
Halloween celebration.

“(The Halloween Concert) 

not only connects musicians 
with 
the 
audience, 
but 

different parts of the audience 
with each other — students 
and community,” conductor 

Kenneth Kiesler said in an 
interview with The Daily about 
the function of the concert’s 
tradition.

Tal Benatar will conduct 

the National Anthem, Daniel 
Brotman 
will 
conduct 

“Shostakovich Symphony No. 1 
Movement 2,” Regulo Stabilito 
will conduct de Falla’s “Finale 
from 3 Cornered Hat Suite,” 
Charlotte Politi will conduct 
“La Valse” by Ravel, Nathan 
Bieber will conduct “March to 
the Scaffold” from “Symphonie 
Fantastique” 
by 
Berlioz, 

Rotem Weinberg will conduct 
“Intermezzo” from the opera 
“Manon Lescaut,” Elias Miller 
will conduct “Dance of the 
Seven Veils” from Richard 
Strauss’s opera “Salome” and 
Chelsea Gallo will conduct 
“Finale” from Dvorak’s “New 
World Symphony.”

To follow the theme of 

“Michigan 
Sports,” 
Jerry 

Bilik’s piece “Variations on 
Hail to the Victors” will return 
to Hill Auditorium after its 
success during the University 
Symphony 
Orchestra’s 

opening 
performance. 
The 

orchestra 
will 
end 
with 

the 
traditional 
Halloween 

Concert encore of the theme 
from 
“Ghostbusters.” 
The 

conductors will all be dancing 
on stage, in costume along 
with the rest of the orchestra.

“We 
chose 
this 
music 

because 
it’s 
exciting, 

colorful, thrilling, dramatic, 
entertaining music,” Kiesler 
explained. “(It’s) great music, 
music that we love to do and 
love to play and that we know 
the audience will really enjoy.”

Originating from the African 
Gumboot 
dance 
that 
was 
performed in the mines of South 
Africa during apartheid, stepping 
has served as a form of self-
expression and liberation for years. 
Now seen in National Pan-Hellenic 
Council fraternities and sororities, 
stepping is a dynamic art form 
to display history and tradition 
through stomping, clapping and 
spoken word. Though related, 
stepping is not to be confused 
with strolling, which occurs when 
members line up and collectively 
dance to a song that is usually a 
trademark of that organization.
Step shows are one of the best 
ways to rally the Black community 
together 
and 
create 
a 
sense 
of belonging and identity for 
students at predominantly white 
institutions as well as historically 
black colleges and universities.
“Stepping and marching has 
history in Pan-Africanism and 
it connects us to our ancestors,” 
Public 
Health 
senior 
Jaren 

Kirkland, president of Omega Psi 
Phi, said. “For the community, the 
step show is representation. It’s an 
event for us, by us, and I think that 
large events like this are needed for 
the community to continue to be 
unified.”
At the University of Michigan, 
the Black population is slowly 
dwindling at its current 4.24 
percent as of Winter 2018, and the 
newly admitted freshman class 
has dipped below enrollment in 
previous years. Performances that 
highlight Black excellence and 
expression provide a safe haven for 
Black students who frequently face 
issues of underrepresentation and 
racial anxiety on college campuses. 
There’s 
something 
special 
about seeing the different Greek 
organizations embody their values 
and history conjoined by their 
sorors and brothers as they proudly 
display their organization’s colors 
and history.
Any Black person can appreciate 
step shows, whether they have 
a connection to National Pan-
Hellenic Council or not. There’s 
something electric about being in 
a room full of other Black people 
that’s brimming with the energy 

and excitement of watching the 
performances. Current students 
and alumni alike packed into 
the Michigan Theater Sunday 
night to celebrate the different 
fraternities and sororities. Alumni 
proudly represented their Greek 
organizations with their colors 
and symbols, singing and clapping 
along to their groups’ steps as they 
performed on stage for the 2018 
National 
Pan-Hellenic 
Council 
Step Show.
This year’s theme was the 
Divine Olympics. Each sorority 
and fraternity performed while 
incorporating 
elements 
of 
athleticism into their routine. 
Featuring humorous narrations 
for dramatized sport scenarios, the 
fraternities and sororities did not 
disappoint with both their acting 
and their sharp movements.
Sigma Gamma Rho opened 
the show with blue and gold 
cheerleader uniforms, and their 
excitement 
pulsed 
through 
the crowd for the remainder of 
the show. Their gold and blue 
boots dazzled across the stage 
with high kicks and stomps that 
vibrated 
through 
the 
theater. 
With tantalizing flips and tricks, 

they clearly were in their element; 
but perhaps the most memorable 
part was when they lined up with 
linked arms and did the Sigma 
Lean — a move so difficult that 
most sororities can’t hold. They 
killed it as the opening act.
The Sigmas performed next, 
surprising the crowd as the 
University campus does not see 
them step very often. With a soccer 
theme and comedic jabs through 
their performance, they were the 
best surprise of the night. Their 
exaggerated hair flips and poodle-
esque hand jives made no sorority 
safe from the Sigmas, as they 
seamlessly tied in a tight rhythm 
with their stomps and comedic hip 
grinds. Who doesn’t love seeing a 
dedicated pelvic thrust midway 
through a tight step routine?
Delta Sigma Theta ran with 
a baseball theme, stealing home 
base with their crimson and cream 
colors. Ingeniously, the Deltas 
incorporated the use of the runner 
of the bases to mimic each of the 
other sororities, and these allusions 
were not missed throughout their 
performance. Their steps were 
tight, and the reverberating sound 
of their stomps energized the 

crowd as they yelled out their calls. 
Overall, their creativity hit a home 
run.
Zeta Phi Beta followed up next 
with a dynamic basketball-themed 
routine, incorporating charismatic 
game-time energy and props into 
their 
movements. 
Their 
sleek 
shoulder rolls and exaggerated 
leaps got some of the most energetic 
crowd reactions. Even though their 
sorority had the smallest number of 
members performing, their routine 
effortlessly stole the spotlight and 
demanded the attention and praise 
of the audience.
Finally, Omega Psi Phi, or the 
Ques, took the stage with dark 
purple robes embroidered with 
gold and the audience fell silent. 
Brilliantly fusing Kung-Fu jumps 
and kicks with their trademark 
marches and hops, their creativity 
shone through their performance. 
From the staged fight scene with 
exaggerated groans to belting out 
in song that took the audience 
to church, they used the stage to 
their advantage. The coordination 
of their marches was brilliantly 
executed as they manipulated 
their bodies to create illusions that 
were mesmerizing to watch; their 

performance was a great way to 
end the night.
Ultimately, the winners of the 
Step Show were Delta Sigma Theta 
and Omega Psi Phi. Each winner 
received a trophy after being judged 
for their intricate routines, as well 
as proud audience reactions from 
all around the state of Michigan 
and beyond. Regardless of who 
took home the trophies, there was 
no doubt that every fraternity 
and sorority bristled with pride at 
the opportunity to be a part of a 
lineage of tradition for years and 
generations to come.
“The 
step 
show 
is 
about 
tradition,” Kirkland said. “We 
haven’t had a step show since 
March 2016, my freshman year, so 
the majority of campus has never 
seen one. For me to participate 
in the step show with the other 
Ques, it’s about continuing that 
tradition and sharing the aspects 
of Greek life that I fell in love with 
as a freshman in attempt to inspire 
those under me to continue the 
tradition.”
Hopefully, this will not be 
the last time that we see Black 
fraternities and sororities grace the 
stage of the Michigan Theater.

Ques, Deltas win 2018 NPHC Step Show

I don’t like Taylor Swift.
I think her songs are mostly 
overrated, I think she’s not 
particularly musically talented 
and I definitely think she’s 
benefited a lot from white 
female fragility in the pop 
culture scene. I think she’s 
problematic in a very typical-
white-female-pop-star 
kind 
of way where accusations of 
cultural 
appropriation 
and 
racism glide off her back because 
her public relations game is on 
point — she’s either America’s 

darling or a “bad bitch” who’s 
embraced the snake emoji a 
little too much on any given day.
So the straits must be dire 
when I, of all people, think 
that Taylor Swift is doing good 
things.
Taylor Swift opened the 2018 
American Music Awards with 
a grand performance of “I Did 
Something Bad” from her latest 
album 
Reputation, 
complete 
with fire blasts and her giant 
stage snake (it makes sense in 
context), to cheers and applause. 
Over the course of the evening, 
she won four awards: Best Tour, 
Best Pop/Rock Album, Best 
Pop/Rock Female Artist and 
Artist of the Year. In addition 

to the accolades, Swift broke 
the record for the AMA’s most 
awarded female artist with a 
total of 22 trophies.
While I’m not pleased that 
she defeated Whitney Houston’s 
record, I have to admit — 
Taylor Swift is popular. She 
has 112 million followers on 
Instagram. She has the privilege 
of an extremely wide-reaching 
platform with the ability to sway 
thoughts and opinions one way 
or the other. Taylor has been 
pretty on and off about using 
this ability, however. In 2017, she 
was named among the “Silence 
Breakers” in Time’s Person of 
the Year article for speaking out 
about her sexual assault. Earlier 

that 
year, 
however, 
Taylor 
Swift had come under fire for 
her 
Women’s 
March 
tweet 
where she supported the march 
but did not participate in it. She 
was a feminist when it benefited 
her, but not when it could lose 
her fans.
And 
how 
things 
have 
changed. 
Taylor 
Swift 
was 
rather infamously silent during 
the 2016 election cycle and now 
here she is, stealing the hearts 
of liberals everywhere with her 
endorsement 
of 
Democratic 
candidates 
in 
Tennessee 
in 
what is shaping up to be a rather 
critical election.
Maybe I’m being picky when 
I say that it might have been 
more helpful to post this on 
Instagram a bit earlier so her 
fans had more time to register. 
I also wouldn’t credit her with 

the last minute increase in 
voter registration when so many 

volunteers spent hours of work 

doing the same thing. But at this 
point, I don’t even care. Taylor 
Swift did something good.
The 
fact 
that 
carefully 
nonpartisan 
Taylor 
Swift 
is 
getting 
“political” 
is 
a 
testament to these turbulent 
times. People must participate 
in our democracy as much as 
they conceivably can. I believe 
it 
is 
especially 
important 
for celebrities — who aren’t 
obligated to use their platforms 
for these issues — to be political 
even at the expense of losing 
album sales.
For once, Taylor Swift and I 
are in agreement. I’m not about 
to start jamming out to her 
tunes, but on Nov. 6, I hope to 
see everyone at the polls. It’s 
what Taylor Swift would want 
you to do.

What to do on Saturday
I 

keep 
thinking 
about 
Saturday, 
and I don’t 
know what 
to do with 
myself. For 
the last eight 
weeks, the 
Daily foot-
ball beat 
and I have been in a press 
box somewhere, watching the 
Michigan football team play.
We’ve seen the Wolver-
ines stumble in South Bend, 
we’ve seen this seven-game 
win streak, we’ve seen the 
Northwestern student body 
run across the field before the 
game and we’ve seen a light-
ning delay threaten our sanity 
in East Lansing.
But this week, Michigan 
has a bye, so I’ll be in Ann 
Arbor with no real itinerary. I 
assume most Wolverines fans 
are planning the off day, too, 
so I’m here to suggest some 
options.
Here are five good ways to 
spend your bye-week Saturday.
1. Mow your lawn
This first option is brought 
to you by my dad.
I don’t have a lawn to mow 
anymore, because I’m a boujee 
college student who lives in 
a college house that gets its 
lawn mowed by some service.
But I know that if I didn’t 
go to college and was still at 
home, my dad would ask me to 
mow our lawn, because there 
really isn’t an excuse not to.
I know what you’re think-
ing. It’s the fall and nobody 
will notice if your lawn gets 
a little out of hand before the 
snow starts falling. But I also 
know that you don’t really 
believe that, and you’re gonna 
have to mow or rake your lawn 
eventually, so why not throw a 
bag on that John Deere and do 
both at the same time?
2. Go to a cider mill

What a classic Michigan 
tradition. I haven’t been to 
a cider mill in several years 
now, but I’m strongly consid-
ering breaking 
that streak on 
Saturday.
The thing is 
that cider mills 
sound really 
great in princi-
ple but are kind 
of underwhelm-
ing in person. 
I don’t know if 
that’s a hot take. 
Maybe I’ll get 
scolded for this.
You drive to the cider mill, 
the foliage is beautiful, you 
can’t wait to get your hands on 
a nice, warm, flaky donut and 

some apple cider, but then you 
get there and it’s 40 degrees 
and windy, and really all you 
want to do is get back in the 
car right away.
If it was a 
gameday Sat-
urday, I would 
think you were 
insane to con-
sider going to a 
cider mill and 
skipping foot-
ball, but you’ve 
got to go once 
this year, and 
the bye week 
seems like as 
good a time as any to make the 
trip.
3. Visit your parents
They miss you. Stop tell-

ing yourself that a phone 
call is enough. They’d love to 
cook you a meal and ask you 
about your job or love life or 
children or 
whatever your 
situation might 
be.
Most Satur-
days, if you’re 
weighing a visit 
to your parents 
against sitting 
and watching 
football, you 
would almost 
certainly take 
the latter. But 
the bye week is a perfect time 
to get that visit in so you feel 
good about yourself when you 
don’t see them again for the 

final, four-week home stretch 
of the football season.
4. Go see “A Star is Born”
This is my favorite option. 
I’ve heard noth-
ing but Oscar 
hype for this 
movie. Lady 
Gaga is appar-
ently incredible, 
Bradley Cooper 
is believable and 
the soundtrack 
is stacked.
Okay, also 
it’s supposed to 
be heartbreak-
ingly sad, but 
the movie theatre is dark and 
nobody will blame you for cry-
ing. Also, you probably haven’t 
had a good cry in a while, and 

it’s good to get those emotions 
out.
This also checks a box for 
when the Oscars come around. 
Every year, you have to watch 
at least one movie that gets 
some nominations. That way 
you can sound smart when you 
comment, ‘Oh, yeah, I saw that 
movie, and the two lead actors 
were good and so was the 
supporting cast and also the 
music was great.’
What more could you ask 
for?
5. Stay in, do nothing and 
watch football
You’re going to do it any-
ways, because you love watch-
ing football. If you didn’t love 
watching football, then why 
did you watch that ridiculous 
game on Saturday? Why, when 
there was an hour-and-a-half 
lightning delay, did you not 
think, ‘You know what? I’m 
going to find something pro-
ductive to do instead of wait-
ing for Gus Johnson to return 
to my television and start yell-
ing at me again.’
But you didn’t do that, did 
you? You sat and waited like 
everybody else. So just give 
in to your feelings and watch 
that Michigan State – Purdue 
game or the World’s Larg-
est Cocktail Party between 
Georgia and Florida in Jack-
sonville.
Personally, I’ve got my eyes 
on Wisconsin – Northwestern, 
because I believe the Wildcats 
are somehow going to win the 
Big Ten West with like a 7-5 
record. That will be electric.
So just watch football. 
Something cool will happen, 
I’m sure, and you know you 
don’t want to miss it. There is 
no bye week for football fans.
See you on the couch.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Michigan gearing up for St. Lawrence 

The 
pieces 
are 
slowly 
starting to come together.
Despite 
the 
No. 
12 
Michigan hockey team’s 1-2 
record, there’s been visible 
improvement in each game.
Sometimes 
the 
defense 
will 
show 
flashes 
of 
a 
lockdown group of blueliners. 
Sometimes, the offense looks 
like it has found its rhythm.
But with St. Lawrence (1-3) 
coming to town this weekend, 
it’s time for the Wolverines 
to put all the pieces together 
and finish brushing off the 
summer dust.
“It obviously takes a little 
bit to get the rust off from 
summer hockey and all that 
and get really going in the 
games,” said senior forward 
Brendan Warren. “But I think 
every 
game 
we’ve 
played, 
we’ve gotten better with the 
puck and better defensively, 
and just better all around. I 
think as we keep going here 
and working on things every 
week, 
we’re 
gonna 
keep 
getting better.”
The 
place 
Michigan 
has 
predominantly 
shown 
rustiness 
has 
been 
on 
possession — not just in the 
offensive zone or in the neutral 
zone, but anywhere on the 
ice. Countless turnovers and 
sloppy passes have led directly 
to goals for opposing teams.
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson says the turnover 
issue has been addressed, but 
the next step is showing that 
improvement in a game.
“Now we have to go out and 
improve and learn from it, 
and sometimes that’s easier 
said than done because the 
pressure of a game, it’s hard 
to recreate that in practice,” 
Pearson said. “You’re trying to. 
You’re trying to create game-
like situations, so whenever 
they get in those spots where 
they can’t turn the puck over, 

they make a better read.”
As a team deep in a rebuild, 
St. Lawrence holds the drive 
of desperation, likely to take 
advantage of any opportunity 
the Wolverines 
give them.
“They’re 
gonna 
be 
scrappy. 
They’re 
desperate,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“They’re trying 
to 
rebuild 
there, 
their 
coach is in his 
second 
year 
there and he’s done a good job. 
They’re a scary team to play. 
You look at some of games they 
had last year, a lot of one-goal 
losses, especially early.”
Michigan has had two games 
decided by one goal this season 

— a 6-5 win over No. 19 Western 
Michigan and a 5-4 loss to the 
Broncos the following night. 
The Wolverines have, at times, 
been caught starting slow and 
not 
competing 
from 
the 
first 
puck drop.
In 
this 
weekend’s 
series, 
they’ll 
have to be ready 
from 
the 
very 
beginning.
“(The 
Saints 
are) gonna show 
up, 
they’re 
gonna 
play 
physical and they’re gonna 
compete,” Pearson said. “We 
have to make sure we bring 
our compete hats first and 
foremost and then skill can 
take over.
“Will (beats) skill if skill 

doesn’t show up.”
And this series is more than 
just an opportunity for the 
Wolverines to put the pieces 
together and knock the dust 
off.
In Friday’s game, Michigan 
will 
raise 
awareness 
for 
ALS 
— 
the 
incurable 
neurodegenerative 
disorder 
that former Wolverine Scott 
Matzka suffers from. Matzka 
was a member of the 1997 
National 
Champion 
team 
and 
played 
under 
Pearson 
throughout 
his 
Michigan 
career.
“It’s really important to us,” 
Warren said. “Everyone knows 
(Matzka) and everything that 
he’s been going through, so 
this is a big game for us to 
really do our part in helping 
the awareness get out about 
ALS and help (Matzka).” 

Johns balancing structure 
and athleticism for ‘M’

Brandon 
Johns 
has 
probably 
answered 
this 
question before. He’s more 
than happy to answer it 
again.
“Seventh grade,” he says, 
a hint of pride in his voice. 
“That was the first time I 
dunked, ever.”
If you’re looking for one 
fact to characterize Johns’ 
game, it’s that. He could rim-
graze at 12. Quickly, though, 
he corrects himself.
“Actually, 
no, 
my 
first 
dunk was sixth grade.
“It was in my gym class, 
cause 
I 
was 
trying 
to 
dunk. And to 
be able to dunk 
at 
that 
age, 
everybody’s 
like, 
‘What’s 
— 
are 
you? 
Ok, 
you’re 
a 
freak, 
or 
something.’”
Back 
then, 
the freshman 
forward 
guesses, 
he 
was 
6-foot-5 or 6-foot-6. Maybe 
freak is the right word.
Now, Johns is listed as 
6-foot-8, 225 pounds, and 
that feels like a conservative 
estimate. 
The 
raw 
athleticism jumps out. His 
high school tape is a clinic on 
catching lobs, putting back 
dunks and pushing the ball 
in transition.
“When 
I 
see 
Brandon 
take those big strides, it’s 
just, wow,” said sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers.
He doesn’t mean that in 
terms 
of 
Johns 
grasping 
Michigan’s system. He means 
it in a literal sense.
Molding 
that 
talent 
to 
Michigan coach John Beilein’s 
system will be the challenge 
for Johns. After dominating 
at every level, Johns suddenly 
won’t be the 
best 
player 
on the court. 
It’s no secret 
that 
Beilein 
starts 
his 
players 
from 
the beginning 
— 
rebuilding 
muscle 
memory 
on 
pivots 
and 
chest passes.
Johns has spent all his 
life running the floor, then 
jumping off one foot before 
shooting or passing. That has 
to change now. Finishing off 
two feet is a sticking point for 
Beilein.
“It’s so hard,” Johns said. 
“Cause I’ve been doing it 
almost all my life. So, to 
finally try to break that, it’s 
kind of been a struggle, but 
I’m getting used to it. So, 
it’s coming along really well 
now.”
Still, 
there’s 
a 
natural 
hesitancy early in the year. 

Johns is learning to balance 
his raw ability with the 
structure required to play 
under Beilein. That will take 
time. It’s the little things that 
need to be fixed.
Recently 
in 
practice, 
Johns slowed down for a 
runner instead of charging 
into the paint and dunking 
on someone. That’s the type 
of behavior Beilein wants to 
eradicate.
“(For) Brandon, it’s pretty 
simple,” Beilein said. “You 
gotta go in and use all those 
god-given talents. And he 
will.”
It doesn’t take much to see 
that Beilein is right about 
the 
talent. 
Freshman 
forward 
Colin 
Castleton 
relayed a story 
that 
conveys 
the 
opposite 
of 
hesitancy. 
In 
a 
recent 
practice, Johns, 
without anyone 
boxing him out, 
slammed home 
a putback dunk, coming out of 
nowhere.
That’s what the Wolverines 
want Johns to be — a raging 
ball 
of 
athleticism, 
with 
enough confidence to know 
when to put a wide range of 
skill on display and when to 
tone it down.
“When 
he 
figures 
his 
confidence out, it’s bad, cause 
he can be very aggressive,” 
Livers said. “He has a nice, 
fluent 
jump 
shot. 
He’s 
athletic. And just, defense. 
It starts all on defense and 
rebounding right now. He’s 
working on going to the glass 
more on the offensive side, 
getting offensive rebounds 
and just moving his feet when 
he’s guarding Zavier Simpson 
or Dave DeJulius out there.”
Livers knows what Johns 
is going through. He did it 
last year — well 
enough to earn 
a starting spot 
by 
January 
— 
and 
won’t 
be 
shocked 
if 
Johns 
does 
the same. The 
two 
Michigan 
natives 
— 
Livers 
from 
Kalamazoo, 
Johns 
from 
East Lansing — have known 
each other for years. They’re 
one 
year 
apart, 
and 
it 
wasn’t irregular for them 
to show up at the same AAU 
tournaments.
When Johns is hesitant 
on offense, or doesn’t know 
where to be on defense, it’s 
Livers who can lend a hand.
“I have to help him,” Livers 
said. “I’d feel wrong if I didn’t 
help my guy.”
In middle school, when 
Livers first met Johns, he 
was easy to pick out. He was 
dunking in warmups.

Lavigne models play after NHL goaltenders

Carey Price, Jonathan Quick, 
Marc André Fleury and Roberto 
Luongo are all National Hockey 
League superstars in their own 
rights. But, they have something 
else in common.
They’ve all contributed a 
little bit of style to Michigan 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne.
It 
started 
with 
Luongo, 
a goaltender for the Florida 
Panthers. After all, it’s hard not 
to look up to someone who was 
a finalist for the Hart and Vezina 
Trophy — two of the highest 
NHL accolades possible.
But Lavigne had a simpler 
reason for looking up to the 
18-season veteran.
“I loved his outward comedic 
presence while he was still a 
professional athlete,” Lavigne 
said. “He approached every 
game like he knew what he had 
to do and what it takes, and we 
see that now that he’s played 
1,000 NHL games. But he’s still 
very vocal on Twitter, and he’s 
sarcastic on Twitter and funny, 
he likes to goof around.
“Which, I think he was a good 
outlet for me since I was always 
so serious and quiet in the locker 
room. It was a good way for me 
to see like, ‘Oh, you can relax a 
little bit and have some fun and 
still be competitive and ready to 
go.’ ”
While Lavigne and Luongo 
are not nearly as similar off the 
ice, they share traits on the ice 
that Lavigne tries to emulate.
Luongo 
is 
an 
athletic 
goaltender who uses his 6-foot-3 
frame and build to his advantage. 
Due to his athleticism, he is 
proficient in catching the puck 
with his glove rather than just 
blocking it. With the same height 
and a similar build as Luongo, 
Lavigne has always been a more 
athletic goaltender.
Mechanically, 
though, 
Lavigne wanted to make his game 
similar to Price, the Montreal 
Canadiens’ starting goalie.
“I think through juniors and 
everything I always tried to 
model myself after Carey Price,” 
Lavigne said. “And the last 

couple years I’ve really realized 
that that’s not a thing that 
happens in goaltending. There’s 
not one person that you can play 
exactly like, or very rarely is that 
the case.”
Instead of catering his style 
of play to one player, he instead 
looks to multiple 
role 
models 
with 
different 
strengths.
“So 
recently 
I’ve 
started 
to 
pick four or five 
goalies that I like 
to watch. Like, 
okay, 
what 
do 
they do well that 
I want to play like 
that?” 
Lavigne 
said. “So, Jonathan Quick is 
extremely explosive and battles 
like crazy. So, great, that’s 
something that I can contribute 
to my game. Am I gonna be able 
to play as far out as he does and 
make saves? Probably not. Am I 
gonna be able to skate that fast? 

No, probably not. I can’t do the 
splits every other play. So things 
like that. I don’t play like him, 
but there’s stuff in his game that 
I can emulate in mine.
“And then Carey Price, I love 
his composure and his stance 
and his demeanor. He’s just 
very 
big 
and 
confident 
in 
net, 
so 
that’s 
something that 
I like to try and 
put 
into 
my 
game. And then 
Marc-André 
Fleury, we have 
somebody that 
just 
competes 
and 
outwills 
everybody 
when he plays. He finds a way to 
get it done. So those have been 
three of my favorites the last 
little while.”
As a player, he doesn’t do 
anything 
extraordinarily 
physical, as goaltender coach 
Steve Shields likes to put it. 

Lavigne is athletic but not 
generational. 
His 
game 
is 
defined less by the physical 
aspects than the mental ones — 
a former weakness.
“He’s a confident guy in 
what he does. So technically, 
he’s sound. Technically, he’s 
a precise guy. He wants to do 
everything right,” Shields said. 
“He’s not very tolerant when he 
doesn’t do everything perfectly. 
So technically, he’s a little bit of 
a perfectionist.
“He’s an educated player. 
He knows what other guys are 
doing. He knows what trends 
are. You know, in the past, 
they’d call guys like that the 
rink rat. He’s always involved, 
he’s always looking at what 
other guys are doing and he has 
an opinion about it all, which I 
think it’s really good for a goalie. 
But technically, he’s where he 
needs to be. He just needs to get 
a little bit faster, little bit better 
and a little more consistent 
about everything.”
