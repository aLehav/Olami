ROSEANNE CHAO/Daily

Universities across the United 

States, and especially those in 
the Midwest, are struggling to 
attract international students to 
their 
campuses. 
International 

enrollment has most noticeably 
declined in non-flagship state 
universities, where funding for 
classes and facilities has dried up 
due to the lack of international 
students who are willing to pay full 
price for tuition.

University of Michigan students 

on the Ann Arbor campus, who are 
used to seeing more international 
students every year, may be 
surprised 
to 
find 
Michigan’s 

public institutions are not immune 
to this decline. Of the state’s 15 
public universities, 10 reported a 
declining 
international 
student 

population over the past year, 
including U-M Flint, Michigan 
State University, and Wayne State 
University. However, several of 
these universities have embraced 
strategies like shifting their focus 
to domestic out-of-state students 
and online courses to offset falling 
enrollment rates and revenue. 
These new strategies have been 
successful so far.

Forces behind the decline
James Cotter, director of the 

Office of Admissions at Michigan 
State 
University, 
said 
several 

factors could be responsible for the 
decline in international enrollment, 
including the tense political climate 
in the U.S., represented in policies 
like President Donald Trump’s 
travel ban.

“In the last five years, there’s 

been some things that changed,” 
Cotter said. “Perhaps the climate 
within the United States and the 
lack of a sense of welcomeness that 
the country may be projecting, 
whether that be true or not … We’re 
hearing from students that that’s 
an issue.”

According to its enrollment 

report, 
MSU 
has 
seen 
its 

international enrollment fall from 
its fall 2014 peak of 7,645 students, 
or 15.26 percent of the total student 
population, to 6,850, or 13.69 
percent. Cotter said the numbers 
back in the day may have been 
“artificially high” because other 
universities around the world 
were not as interested in recruiting 

international students, and saw the 
current numbers as appropriate.

“Those international numbers 

(from 
2014) 
may 
have 
been 

artificially high … Most of us in the 
enrollment management profession 
knew that those numbers weren’t 
necessarily sustainable,” Cotter 
said. “Everyone seems to be in the 
game of recruiting international 
students now and that wasn’t 
necessarily the case back in 2011, 
2012, 2013.”

Engineering senior Mary Rose 

Shi, an international student from 
Myanmar, said the high cost of 
tuition in the United States was a 
deterring factor for many of her 
friends back home.

“We’re 
becoming 
more 

globalized, so the opportunities 
available at U.S. colleges are very 
much available outside of the U.S. 
as well,” Shi said.

Funding 
from 
foreign 

governments 
also 
influences 

how 
many 
foreign 
students 

study abroad. Ahmad Ezzeddine, 
associate 
vice 
president 
for 

Educational 
Outreach 
and 

International Programs at Wayne 
State University, said a major factor 
was the rise and fall in government-
sponsored scholarships. As a result 
of the Brazilian government ending 
its Brazilian Scientific Mobility 
Program, Ezzeddine said Wayne 
State’s population of international 
students decreased almost four 
percent, ending a four-year trend of 

increases.

In China, the number of high 

school graduates has been steadily 
decreasing every year, due to the 
country’s one-child policy, which 
was in effect from 1979 to 2015. 
Cotter cited the demographic shift 
in the country and the Chinese 
government’s investment in its 
own higher education system as 
reasons why Chinese students, who 
make up the bulk of international 
students at many universities, 
come in smaller numbers now.

International 
factors 
affect 

some 
schools 
more 
adversely 

than other. The University of 
Michigan-Flint campus has seen its 
international enrollment dwindle 
to 348 students, 4.44 percent of the 
student population, or almost half 
of its 2015 peak of 720, 8.5 percent, 
according to their student profile.

Kristi 
Hottenstein, 
vice 

chancellor 
for 
Enrollment 

Management 
at 
U-M 
Flint, 

explained the decline in Saudi 
Arabian 
students, 
who 
make 

up more than a third of the 
international student population 
at Flint, was a major factor in the 
school’s decline in international 
enrollment overall. The Saudi 
government 
cut 
funding 
for 

students studying abroad in 2016 
due to falling oil prices.

“Any 
enrollment 
decline 

has budget implications for a 
university, and that holds true for 
U-M Flint,” Hottenstein wrote in 
an email interview. “However, our 
university has planned accordingly, 
and we continue to actively recruit 
students from Saudi Arabia, across 
the Middle East and around the 

Community 
members

meeting of the 7th annual 
Sustainable Ann Arbor Forum

“If you speak with data, that

he said.

According to Mirsky, the best 

way of measuring progress is 
through metrics and by tracking 
the information through review 
meetings, along with community 
engagement.

“Stay

It’s 
not 
uncommon 
for 

University 
of 
Michigan 

students to spend late nights 
studying at the University’s 
many libraries. That’s why 
free 
university-sponsored 

transportation 
services 
like 

Campus SafeRide are designed 
to take students, faculty, and 
staff where they need to be 
after-hours. But this service 
created 
to 
bring 
students 

home safely at late hours can 
sometimes leave them waiting 
longer than expected.

The 
SafeRide 
system 

depends on four drivers Sunday 
through Thursday, and three 
on 
Fridays 
and 
Saturdays. 

SafeRide encourages the use of 
their app, which automatically 
assigns a destination to the 
most 
launchable 
driver. 

If 
students 
call, 
drivers 

manually record the necessary 
information.

Some University of Michigan 

users have reported waiting to 

be picked up by SafeRide times 
significantly longer than the 
service advertises. A source 
from SafeRide who requested 
to remain anonymous indicated 
wait 
times 
are 
generally 

15-20 minutes. However, LSA 
sophomore 
Lillie 
Heyman 

experienced twice that when 
she was told her wait time 
would be 40 minutes. 

After the Law Library had 

closed at 12 a.m. on a Saturday 
and buses had retired their 
routes, Heyman needed to get 
back to her dorm at Oxford 
Housing. Never having tried 
SafeRide before, she decided to 
call them. 

“I called the number and 

the person answered, and they 
asked if I wanted to be added to 
the queue of people waiting for 
SafeRide,” Heyman said. “The 
wait was 40 minutes.”

Students 
often 
turn 
to 

SafeRide before transportation 
apps like Uber or Lyft to avoid 
the potentially hefty fees they 
charge, which can exceed $10 
depending on the location.

“My Life. My Story!” lecture celebrates acclaimed members of the trans community

As attendees filled Rackham 

Auditorium 
Thursday 
night, 

a slideshow flashed images of 
acclaimed figures in the trans 
community, both living and dead. 
A few of the many honored were 
actress Laverne Cox, “Survivor” star 
Zeke Smith and Sylvia Rivera, the 
late activist and drag queen. Over 
250 people attended the Trotter 
Multicultural Center’s lecture “My 
Life. My Story! Centering the Voices 

of Trans Lives,” honoring the lives, 
works and stories of transgender 
and nonbinary people. 

Jessica 
Thompson, 
program 

manager for the Trotter Center, 
did much of the organizing for the 
lecture, reaching out to trans student 
speakers at the University, as well as 
the celebrity keynote speakers. At 
the start of the event, she expressed 
her appreciation for the student 
speakers’ willingness to share their 
stories. She said while the celebrity 
speakers brought inspiration to the 
event, it was the students she felt 
were most impressive.

“Although they (the celebrities) 

are amazing, I have to be honest, 
that’s not what makes this event 
star-studded,” Thompson said. “It’s 
the students that make this event 
star-studded.”

The student speakers came from 

diverse backgrounds and different 
parts of the University: Art & Design 
senior D. Wang Zhao, Information 
graduate student Vidhya Aravind, 
Max Mendez, a recent graduate 
from the School of Social Work 
and 2017 LSA graduate Leo Sheng. 
Each student expressed their story 
in different ways, but all included 

their struggles, perseverance and 
gratitude for the support of friends 
and family.

Zhao told their story through 

poetry, using the color blue to 
represent their fluid gender identity 
and 
express 
frustration 
with 

discrimination.

“My blue is not masculine-

centered, not feminine-centered, 
but fluid and indistinguishable,” 
Zhao said. “My blue is of transience 
and of being an immigrant of 
having aesthetics that involve of 
yes, bleaching my eyebrows like I

Wednesday, Gov. Rick Snyder 

suggested a 2 percent increase 
in funding for the state’s higher 
education budget during the 
2018-2019 fiscal year. According 
to a University of Michigan 
press release, the proposed plans 
would provide the University’s 
Ann Arbor campus with $320.8 
million. The budget would also 
provide the Dearborn campus 
with $26.1 million, a 2.6 percent 

increase, and the Flint campus 
with $23.6 million, a 2.3 percent 
increase. 

The 
plan 
would 
recover 

lost funding from the Ann 
Arbor 
campus 
during 
the 

2011 cut to higher education. 
Half 
of 
this 
funding 
is 

contingent 
upon 
University 

milestones in areas including 
research, 
graduation 
rates, 

administrative 
expenditures 

and Pell Grantrecipients. The 
universities must also limit 
tuition increases to 3.8 percent 

or double expected inflation 
rates in order to receive the 
funding.

Cynthia Wilbanks, University 

vice president for government 
relations, was pleased with the 
announcement.

“Investing in higher education 

provides greater opportunities 
to our residents and is absolutely 
critical for our state’s continued 
economic growth,” Wilbanks 
said in a statement to The 
University Record. “We look 
forward to working with our 

representatives in the state 
House and Senate as this 
budget process proceeds.”

The budget also includes 

a 
recommendation 
for 

funding increases at Oakland 
University, Lake Superior State 
University and Michigan State 
University AgBioResearch and 
Extension.

For now, the budget heads 

to the Michigan Legislature 
for amendments and approval 
votes by both the state House 
and Senate.

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the 
scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA 
sophomore Cory Zayance wrote about the strain put on 
the relationship between the Ross School of Business and 
Procter and Gamble after students made a mockery of a 
Q & A with a representative of the company.

“This story was my first experience with some serious, hard-
hitting investigative journalism, s it definitely expanded my 
horizons as a reporter, and was a very interesting story to 
write about. The most interesting part about writing the 
whole thing was choosing which Tide memes I was gonna 
throw in there. I had a lot of options, so I tried to just go with 
my gut and pick which ones I thought would impact the 
reader the most. But just overall, I thought it was a ridiculous 
situation that some tide pod memes asked by students at a 
lecture would potentially jeopardize an entire relationship 
between Ross and one of its biggest recruiters.“

surrounding Tide Pods threatens Ross business 
relationship”

attached to it. They said, ‘We don’t know how we can 
help.’ Now, they’ve had time to understand what we’re

world to ensure a globally diverse 
campus community.”

Despite these challenges, U-M’s 

Ann Arbor campus has held up well, 
with the number and percentage 
of international students growing 
almost 
uninterrupted 
for 
10 

years. In 2008, the percentage 
of international students at the 
University’s Ann Arbor campus 
was 11.55, growing to 15.14 percent 
in 2017.

Kedra Ishop, vice provost for 

Enrollment 
Management, 
said 

because government scholarships 
are 
running 
out 
in 
foreign 

countries, the few students who 
do have funding will choose to go 
to selective institutions where the 
return on investment is high. She 
explained U-M has an established 
brand overseas that will continue 
to pull students and prevent a big 
drop in the number of international 
applications.

“(Foreign) students are going 

to be more selective in where they 
choose to take the funding that 
they have … They are looking at 
institutions that will deliver on the 
educational experience they expect 
to have for that, and Michigan 
is well-regarded nationally and 
internationally,” Ishop said.

Aside from cost, Lucas Lu, 

CEO of Forward Pathway, LLC, 
a 
Pittsburgh-based 
educational 

consulting company for Chinese 
international students, explained 
Chinese students are getting an 
impression the U.S. is becoming less 
safe because of gun violence and 
terrorism reports in the media.

“Chinese parents worry about 

this, we have several customers 
who finished their application then 
suddenly decided not to come to 
U.S. due to the Las Vegas gunshot 

report,” Lu wrote in an email 
interview.

Judith Pennywell, the director 

of the University’s International 
Center, 
added 
the 
University 

undertakes educational campaigns 
to counteract perceptions that the 
United States is a dangerous place.

“International 
students 
are 

welcomed and valued at Michigan, 
and we want to make sure they 
know this despite what they might 
experience in — or feel about — the 
current 
political 
environment,” 

Pennywell wrote in an email 
interview.

And 
after 
they 
arrive, 

international students can expect 
to find support through advising, 
workshops, field trips and social 
events through the International 
Center and other campus resources.

Toward new sources of revenue
The 
trend 
in 
declining 

international student enrollment 
coincides with the general decline 
in enrollment at public universities, 
according 
to 
the 
Michigan 

Association of State Universities.

Ezzeddine said for regional 

universities like Wayne State, the 
economic downturn in Detroit 
after the 2008 financial crisis 
has affected enrollment numbers 
adversely.

“When employers stop providing 

tuition benefits, when jobs are 
limited, school may not be the top 
priority for a prospective student,” 
Ezzeddine wrote. “So they drop 
out of school or don’t pursue that 
graduate degree in which they were 
planning to enroll … And it becomes 
a domino effect.”

Cotter said in response to the 

drop in international enrollment, 
MSU has ramped up efforts to 
attract out-of-state students, who 
also pay more for tuition, to balance 
out the decline in international 
students.

“What Michigan State’s been able 

to do was grow our domestic out-
of-state to minimize the impact of 
international decline,” Cotter said. 
“We feel very fortunate as a flagship 
institution to be able to recruit 
students very, very successfully 
across the state of Michigan, but 
also from Los Angeles to New York 
and around the world.”

When asked about the budgetary 

implications 
of 
an 
increasing 

international population, Ishop said 
there were no big changes.

“Our 
international 
students 

pay the same rate as our domestic 
non-resident students,” Ishop said. 
“International is a part of (out-
of-state students) –– there’s not a 
subsequent budgetary impact.”

For regional universities, the 

push to make up for lost enrollment 
takes a different course. Geoff 
Larcom, executive director of Media 
Relations at Eastern Michigan 
University, 
said 
though 
EMU 

has seen its total enrollment and 
international enrollment decrease 
over the past 10 years, EMU is now 
focusing on online degree courses, 
for which many people pay out-of-
state tuition.

He also noted EMU is working 

harder than ever to recruit and 
retain 
international 
students 

through its #YouAreWelcomeHere 
campaign, which promotes the 
university’s support network for 
foreign students and proximity 
to Detroit Metropolitan Airport. 
EMU President James Smith also 
visited China along with other 
administrative officials last year to 
build bridges with students there.

“One of the ways President Smith 

wants to increase revenue and 
continue improving the campus 
is to increase our enrollment of 
international 
students, 
despite 

any of the forces that might be 
acting in the opposite direction,” 
Larcom said. “We adopted the 
#YouAreWelcomeHere campaign, 
which involves a video and a 

powerful outreach campaign to 
international students, banners, and 
really featuring them in a variety of 
ways that showcases what a good 
experience they can have in the 
Eastern Michigan campus.”

However, international students 

may think differently. Lu pointed 
out flagship and private schools 
like the University of Michigan and 
New York University are recruiting 
more international students than 
ever; in NYU’s case, international 
enrollment shot up from 3,907 in 
2005 to 13,735 in 2017, according 
to their enrollment factbook. This 
means with the same GPA and 
SAT/ACT score, a Chinese student 

now can attend a more selective 
institution than they did if they had 
the same stats 10 years ago.

“Because of Chinese culture, 

Chinese students value ranking as 
the first thing when choose school,” 
Lu wrote. “So now, with GPA 3.0+ 
and TOEFL 90+ they can go to 
Top 80 ranking colleges, why they 
even need to consider non-flagship 
universities?”

Though current trends may be 

disheartening, the U.S. still remains 
one of, if not the most popular 
destination to study for students 
and scholars around the world, 
according to Masahiro Masaki, 
a graduate student from Japan at 

EMU.

“I believe education is one of the 

most critical things to improve our 
living and thinking,” he wrote in an 
email interview. “The U.S. is? Was? 
The country of freedom. Everyone 
who wants to pursue their goals or 
dreams should be given an equal 
chance.”

Shi, echoed the sentiment, saying 

the distance from her home country 
did not deter her from pursuing the 
best education she could obtain. 

“Going abroad for me, 3 hours 

away or 24 hours ride doesn’t 
matter,” Shi said. “(The U.S.) is one 
of the best countries that can offer 
the best education.”

J. Mark Ramseyer, Mitsubishi Professor of Japenese Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, speaks about identity politics in Japan at 
Weiser Hall Thursday.

did last night. My blue is a soft 
blanket.”

Aravind discussed the struggle 

of having so few other South Asian 
trans women in her community, 
discovering her trans identity 
in 
2014 
while 
experiencing 

depression. She said she was 
indebted to the friends she met 
during that difficult time who 
supported her and ultimately 
helped her recognize her trans-
ness.

“My transition is primarily 

the story of community and 
solidarity,” Aravind said. “It’s the 
story of people sacrificing time 
and energy to care for me.”

In Mendez’s speech, they talked 

about not fitting into a gender 
category growing up and how this 
made them feel isolated.

“I remember people always 

calling me tomboy, that I was one 
of the boys,” they said. “To me, that 
meant I wasn’t doing girl right, but 
I wasn’t quite boy enough to be 
respected the way a real boy is. 
I felt broken, like I wasn’t doing 
gender right.”

Mendez 
also 
highlighted 

certain obstacles they face as a 

nonbinary person, such as being 
forced to check either male or 
female on a job application or 
struggling to find a gender-neutral 
bathroom. They conveyed their 
desire to be accepted as who they 
are.

“At the end of the day, I would 

just like people to see me as who 
I am,” they said. “Our existence 
is too nebulous to be filled in one 
box. We’re too full of possibilities.”

Sheng similarly talked about 

being uncomfortable in his gender 
as a child. He talked about his 
rejection of anything considered 
“feminine” as a child, joking that 
to his friends, it was as if he was 
a little Mulan. He then discussed 
his coming out experience and the 
medical transition that followed.

“My body was rapidly forming 

to fit my soul, and while it was 
something I’d wanted more than 
anything for six years, it was 
overwhelming,” he said.

He further noted the changes 

in his thinking since his medical 
transition 
four 
years 
ago, 

especially his acceptance of his 
trans identity as being part of his 
search for happiness.

“I spent so long thinking that 

being trans was a roadblock to 
happiness, but I know now that 
while it doesn’t make it any easier, 

my trans identity isn’t a roadblock, 
but a part of that journey,” Sheng 
said.

After the student speeches and 

a reflective moment of silence, the 
keynote speaker portion of the 
event began. One of these speakers 
was actor Brian Michael Smith, an 
Ann Arbor native, who has had 
roles in TV shows such as “Queen 
Sugar,” “Chicago P.D.” and “Girls.” 
Smith told the story of playing 
for his high school football team, 
despite the fears of his mother and 
the stigmas surrounding it. He 
connected this to his experience 
as a trans person through the 
lesson of going for goals even as 
the people express their doubts.

“As a trans person, a lot of what 

I’m struggling with is not my own 
fear, not my own doubts, but other 
people around me,” Smith said. 
“So I’m here today to tell you don’t 
let that happen to you. There’s so 
much you can do, there’s so much 
in your heart. If that’s something 
you want to do, you have to go for 
it. People will come around, people 
will learn and most importantly 
when you share your story, you’re 
going to give somebody else the 
courage to do that in their life.”

The next speaker was modal 

Amiyah Scott, an actress on the 
TV show, “Star.” She said she was 

grateful for being able to attend 
the event and exist as her trans self 
against all odds.

“I’m thankful first of all because 

the woman you see here today was 
told she couldn’t exist,” Scott said. 
“I was actually told I was crazy for 
thinking she could exist. And I’m 
here.”

She noted the times she’s 

been 
distressed 
while 
trying 

to achieve her dreams and her 
ultimate perseverance. She urged 
the audience to always love 
themselves and fight for their 
ambitions.

“Self-love is very important,” 

she said. “You have to love you. 
Aside from that, you have to 
believe in yourself, you have to 
give yourself a chance.”

Activist Janet Mock, author of 

memoirs “Redefining Realness” 
and “Surpassing Certainty,” was 
the last speaker. She talked about 
coming from an unstable family 
and a neighborhood filled with 
poverty noting her eventual 
success is a rare occurrence in 
her community. She spoke of the 
liberation telling her story gave 
her.

Not wanting to wait outside the 
closed library, Heyman turned to 
the pricey alternative. 

“When I saw the Uber fare was 

so high, I decided to give it a try, 
because 40 minutes is too much 
of a wait for midnight,” she said. 
“So I Ubered.”

The anonymous source said 

such waits are rare. Factors 
like weather, events and traffic, 
she said, can all contribute to 
extended wait times, and the 
limited resources they have make 
it hard to satisfy all demand.

“It all comes down to supply 

and demand. If a lot of people are 
using the system, we only have so 
much supply,” she said. “We try to 
do the best we can with as many 
resources as we have.” 

SafeRide’s app and website 

TapRide 
regularly 
updates 

the pick-up time. At 10 p.m. on 
Wednesday night –– the time 
of night when the anonymous 
source 
said 
requests 
usually 

peak –– the average wait was 30 
minutes. 

The wait time can be longer on 

the nights of football games, the 
anonymous source said. 

“There have been times when 

a football game is getting out and 
people are trying to use it,” she 
said. “That is mostly because of 
traffic and the amount of rides 
coming in can impact the wait 
time.”

For students who live even 

farther away on North Campus, 
transit services like SafeRide are 
crucial. Although Bursley-Baits 
and Northwood routes typically 
run to about 2 a.m. on weekdays 
and weekends, they only depart 
from the C.C. Little bus stop. 
For School of Music, Theatre, 
and Dance freshman Kamryn 
Thomas, the hike to the bus stop 
was too long from South Campus, 
where she had ended up after 
playing with the marching band. 
Not knowing whether buses were 
running on a game day was an 
incentive for her to try SafeRide. 

“It ended up taking 30 to 50 

minutes, or something outrageous 
like that,” Thomas said. “And 
it kept updating the ETA, and 
I was like, ‘Is my phone broken 
or something?’ I didn’t want to 
cancel the ride in case they were 
coming soon or something. So I 
just sat there and waited.”

achieving results, and if we’re 
not achieving results, you need 
to say ‘Folks, you’re not doing 
what you need to do.’”

The City of Ann Arbor has 

outlined four theme areas for 
its Sustainability Framework: 
climate and energy, community, 
land 
use 
and 
access, 
and 

resource management. These 
theme areas contain 16 specific 
goals, or “smart goals,” where 
progress is tracked using a 
series of 38 different metrics.

Considering 
these 

measurement methods, Mirsky 
said Ann Arbor’s sustainable 
future will rely heavily on this 
research.

“I think it’s self-evident that 

a sustainable community is 
what Ann Arborites value and 
what we want,” Mirsky said.

Speaking 
next 
on 
the 

panel 
was 
Matthew 
Naud, 

environmental coordinator for 
Ann Arbor, who commented on 
Ann Arbor’s experience as being 
one of 68 cities across the nation 
involved with Sustainability 
Tools 
for 
Assessing 
and 

Rating 
Communities. 
STAR 

helps Ann Arbor compare its 
sustainability progress with 
other cities. Out of a five-star 
rating, Ann Arbor received 
four stars, ranking the same as 
Columbus, Ohio and Portland, 
Oregon.

Andrew Berki, director of the 

University of Michigan’s Office 
of Campus Sustainability, spoke 
on behalf of the University 
and its goals in regards to 
sustainability.

According to Berki, by 2025, 

the 
University 
will 
reduce 

greenhouse gas emissions by 25 
percent and reduce University-
produced waste by 40 percent.

Much of the University’s 

power is produced at the 
Central Power Plant, which 
converted to natural gas in 
the 1960s and provides steam, 
electricity, compressed air and 
hot water to Central Campus 
and 
Michigan 
Medicine. 

Though natural gas is twice as 
efficient as coal, the University 
would like to increase the 
power plant’s efficiency and 
introduce a larger percentage of 
renewable energy systems.

“

The barrier of loneliness: 
The palpable, desperate need 
of the human animal to be 

with his fellow man … up there is 
an enemy known as isolation” - 
Rod Serling.

The 
haunting 
nature 
of 

loneliness is vividly captured by 
Serling at the end of the very first 
episode of “The Twilight Zone,” in 
which a man finds himself trapped 
in a town with no people in it. 
While you and I will likely never 
experience such a frightening 
scenario, we can nonetheless 
realize the terror of such isolation.

In 2010, the Mental Health 

Foundation 
in 
the 
United 

Kingdom released their findings 
that loneliness, chiefly thought 
about as an issue for the elderly, 
was actually a greater burden 
for young people ages 18 to 34. 
According to the American College 
Health Association, 59.3 percent of 
students report feeling very lonely 
at any time in the past year. It is 
hard to wrap your head around 
the idea that people in the prime 
of their lives, a time full of family 
and friends, could be suffering 
from loneliness. Alas, to feelings of 
loneliness and isolation, age is not 
a number of consequence.

While we should not ignore 

the problem of loneliness in the 
elderly, it is equally important 
to recognize loneliness as a 
major mental health problem for 
young people that should be both 
discussed and addressed.

The link between loneliness 

and poor health outcomes is clear. 
Research in older adults shows 
that loneliness impairs health by 
elevating levels of stress hormones 
and inflammation which can, 
in turn, lead to chronic illnesses 
like heart disease and dementia. 
Writing in The New York Times, 
Dr. Dhruv Khullar of Harvard 
Medical School declared that 
“social isolation is a growing 
epidemic—one that’s increasingly 
recognized 
as 
having 
dire 

physical, mental and emotional 
consequences.” 
Khullar 
also 

points out that isolation can make 
illnesses, such as opioid addiction, 
worse as well as being a potential 
cause of bad health. It is clear that 
loneliness and isolation are more 
than just unpleasant and the health 
consequences—both physical and 

mental—can be severe.

But why are young people 

lonely? To begin to understand 
this, one must learn the typology 
of isolation. In 1973, American 
sociologist Robert S. Weiss divided 
loneliness into social isolation 
and emotional isolation. Social 
isolation is what we typically 
associate with isolation, that is, 
a true lack of social connections. 
Emotional isolation is a much more 
insidious foe. Emotional isolation 
is the internal feeling of loneliness 
in spite of social connections, no 
matter how robust.

I 
definitely 
suffer 
from 

emotional isolation. I am not a 
recluse, I go out to parties and 
other social events. I have friends 
who I can confide in and who I 
enjoy spending time with. Yet, in 
those times when I am sitting on 
my couch, the hungry pangs of 
loneliness gnawing at my mind 
and soul, I feel like I have no one 
and that I am utterly alone. In 
the past year, these times of peak 
loneliness have gotten more and 
more frequent. Safe to say, it sucks.

Emotional isolation, in my 

view, has its roots in the culture 
we live in. While preexisting 
mental health problems, such 
as 
depression 
and 
anxiety, 

obviously 
contribute 
to 
this 

imagined isolation, it is the social 
environment we navigate through 
on the daily that provides an ample 
medium for loneliness to flourish.

For example, social media, 

which should have ushered in a 
new era of connectedness, may 
actually be making us feel more 
isolated. Now, I happen to find 
Facebook very useful and am not 
one to attack social media as the 
bringer of doom to our generation. 
That being said, a study out of 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Department of Psychology found 

that Facebook use is a predictor 
of declining happiness and that it 
undermines well-being.

The Achilles’ heel of social 

media is that it increases the 
quantity of social connection but 
not necessarily the quality. This 
is the case because social media 
reduces someone’s personality, 
thoughts and lived experiences 
into a caricature and encourages 
us to judge people based off of 
that simulacrum. Take Tinder, 
an app where we judge and are 
judged based off of some pictures 
and a bio where wit matters more 
than substance. Sure, the instant 
gratification of a Tinder match is 
addictive at first but after a while it 
makes me feel hollow.

Social media is just the tip 

of the iceberg that is our lonely 
culture. Those of us socialized 
as men are not really allowed 
spaces to foster real connections 
with other people. In media, male 
friendships are portrayed as fun 
but almost never as emotionally 
supportive. And while Valentine’s 
Day is a frivolous Hallmark 
holiday, it is still a reminder that 
romantic relationships are the 
quintessential social connection 
in our society. Platonic love, a 
beautiful thing in its own right, is 
presented as inferior to romantic 
love. This is problematic because 
it prevents us from realizing that, 
even if we are single, that we 
are not alone. I am consistently 
surprised by how many people 
I am connected with where we 
mutually care about each other, all 
I have to do is reach out.

Last May, The Washington 

Post ran an article titled, “Senior 
loneliness is a disease that can and 
should be treated.” I would very 
much like to see similar attention 
paid to loneliness in young people 
because 
loneliness 
hurts, 
no 

matter the age.

I empathize wholeheartedly 

with my fellow college students 
who are struggling with loneliness. 
I know there is light at the end of 
the tunnel and we will reach that 
light with our heads held high. 
We are stronger than the enemy 
known as isolation.

T

his past week, one of my 
favorite podcasts, “Stuff 
Mom Never Told You”, 

discussed a topic I 
have experienced but 
never found a way to 
articulate. The hosts 
sat down with Jill 
Filipovic, author of 
“The 
H-Spot: 
The 

Feminist 
Pursuit 

of 
Happiness.” 
In 

essence, she spoke 
about the importance 
of 
prioritizing 

women’s fulfillment 
and 
joy 
in 
the 
feminist 

movement. After all, isn’t that 
at the core of what we all want?

Their 
discussion 
was 

centered on happiness within 
marriage. 
They 
discussed 

whether there could ever be a 
feminist marriage, given the 
sexist nature of the institution. 
I’m only a junior in college, still 
four years out from entering 
the post-law school real world, 
so I won’t feign authority on 
that subject. However, I do feel 
that an emphasis on happiness, 
and 
especially 
happiness 

within romantic relationships, 
is 
lacking 
in 
the 
feminist 

conversation. Personally, it is 
much easier for me to write and 
talk about my pain when I talk 
about my romantic experiences. 
This is for good reason—my first 
serious relationship ended in a 
courtroom, with me pursuing a 
Personal Protection Order.

I was 17, prying myself 

out of a toxic and confusing 
relationship with a person I met 
at 14. Making sense of the three 
years I knew him, of the seven 
months we dated and of how 
I ended up in Oakland County 
Circuit Court led me to a variety 
of conclusions. I learned about 
gender-based violence, about 
rape culture, about systemic 
problems that throw young 
women into terrifying situations 
with no knowledge of how to 
get out. It was this feminist 
awakening that has guided me 
through life since.

I am eternally grateful for 

the path I took to pull myself 
out of that pain. Feminism and 
the pursuit of social justice 
have 
come 
to 
dramatically 

shape 
my 
friendships, 

intellectual 
interests, 
self-

image, professional path and 
even my eating habits. However, 

the personal manifestation of 
feminism I used to pull myself 
up and out was defined by an 

urge to be strong, 
unbreakable 
and 

impervious to any 
hurt that could send 
me back there. I see 
this 
among 
many 

survivors; it is an 
understandable way 
to heal. It does not 
eradicate the pain 
of abuse though; it 
merely silences it. So, 
I spent my first year 

of college drinking pink moscato 
(cringe), lecturing my friends 
about how manipulative and 
toxic all of their relationships 
were and swerving from any 
man who dared to reveal a bit 
of feeling.

I truly believed that all of 

my friends were in relationships 
that undermined their autonomy 
and hindered their growth. 
Today, I would hold that some 
of that was true. The nature of 
so many romantic relationships 
is toxic and controlling, and I 
think that is a truth we need 
to focus more attention on. 
Your partner should not tell 
you what to wear, who to see, 
what to think; they should not 
belittle or threaten you, should 
not ever make you feel less. 
However, there must be some 
good to be found in love and 
romance. If not, why would we 
continue to seek it out? But are 
there feminist relationships, or 
is the nature of heterosexual 
romance always going to lead 
to a situation in which the man 
is advantaged?

Jill 
Filipovic 
said 
she 

never thought she’d marry 
until she met her fiancé. I 
never thought I’d date after 
my first experience until I 
met my current boyfriend. 
I was quite head over heels 

at our first encounter, but I 
was also cripplingly anxious 
about the prospect of investing 
myself in another relationship. 
Yet, I discovered that while 
it was possible for a toxic 
relationship to eradicate my 
sense of self and esteem, it was 
also possible for one to do the 
opposite. The very reason I’m 
writing this article is because 
my boyfriend has read, revised 
and praised so much of my 
writing that I felt confident 
enough to apply to The Daily. A 
year ago, that comment would 
have made me uncomfortable, 
as if I was crediting my own 
accomplishments to a man. 
But I don’t want to be cynical 
about love anymore. I don’t 
want to give any more to a 
man in the past who tried 
so hard to ruin joy for me. I 
want to feel liberated from 
that time, and the best way 
to do that has been to love 
without caution or restraint 
or especially the feeling that 
I’m 
somehow 
undermining 

my feminist philosophy for 
simply choosing happiness.

I’m sitting in bed writing 

this next to my boyfriend with 
respiratory flu and a fever of 
103. We are surrounded by a 
mess of tissues, Tamiflu and 
lentil soup. I’m thinking back 
to when I had mono last year, 
and he came to my parent’s 
house with me every weekend 
and sat in my living room with 
my mom while I took eight-
hour naps. I am growing more 
comfortable 
accepting 
and 

giving care. I am learning 
and re-learning how to be 
vulnerable, to act selflessly, to 
not worry that my mind, soul or 
body are being taken advantage 
of. I deserve that peace, as do 
all women and all people who 
have had it ripped from that in 
prior experiences.

So, this Valentine’s Day, 

if you are also feeling scared, 
anxious 
or 
cynical 
about 

the prospect of romance, I 
encourage you to embrace 
vulnerability. I encourage you 
to resist the horrific world we 
live in by choosing love and 
joy, whatever that may mean 
for you.

Feminism, love and happiness

E

arlier this semester, I 
discovered one of my 
classmates is a racist. While 

sitting in our shared discussion, 
she sent me messages that were 
simultaneously 
abhorrent 
and 

surprising. 
Furthermore, 
she 

did so by using a deeply offensive 
term. As she wrote to me in three 
separate, unexpected texts, “i’m 
also racist so that doesn’t help…
not trynna get too dark over here 
but i don’t like n******…lol there’s 
a difference between blacks and 
n******.” She was an unambiguous, 
unapologetic racist.

Her appalling texts left me 

filled with disgust and led me to 
question my preconceived notions 
of what racism on campus looks 
like. Though I have witnessed 
racism before, this was the 
first time I had seen it directly 
expressed by a fellow University of 
Michigan student. The realization 
that one of my peers held racist 
views was a shocking reality check 
— I knew there had been racist 
incidents in Ann Arbor in the past, 
but I was comforted by the fact that 
no University students were ever 
caught committing them. “Maybe 
a visitor or a townie did it,” I would 
internally assure myself. As I 
continued to pore over the details 
of my chance encounter with such 
casual racism, the conversation’s 
full implications became apparent 
and 
the 
following 
questions 

emerged: If I had this one chance 
encounter with a single classmate 
of mine, how many other closeted 
(or in her case, non-closeted) 
bigots were there in my classes? 
In my majors? In my beloved 

University of Michigan?

I came to the University of 

Michigan because I believed it to 
be the greatest public university 
in the nation, if not the world. 
However, the discovery that at 
least one of my peers, and likely 
many more, seem to have such 
spectacularly repugnant views 
on the topic of race has rocked 
this opinion. Nevertheless, I 
possess great hope for what 
I believe to be a subset of the 
University community to change 
for the better.

To individuals who share 

similar sentiments regarding race 
as my classmate, I ask you this: 
Are the beliefs you hold worthy of 
someone who attends Michigan? 
Worthy of one of the historical 
centers of American activism, the 
alma mater of Gerald Ford (’35), a 
staunch supporter of civil rights, 
and Branch Rickey (JD 1911), who 
was instrumental in helping to 
break professional baseball’s color 
barrier? A transformation in your 
thinking is needed.

To be clear, I’m not asking you to 

become an expert on social justice 
issues that are relevant today nor 
am I asking you to change your 
political leanings in any capacity. 
Instead, to paraphrase Martin 
Luther King Jr., I merely hope that 
you begin to judge people by their 
character, rather than their race. 
However, if you choose to continue 
discriminating against individuals 
on the basis of their skin color, I 
hope that you will at least have the 
wisdom to see what you are doing 
is inherently wrong.

While advocating for an end to 

racism among my peers is hardly 
the “hot take” that one would 
expect to find in the Opinion 
section of The Michigan Daily, 
I strongly feel that the broader 
topic of race at the University of 
Michigan has to be discussed 
further in the student body. 
University-sponsored 
classes, 

seminars or meetings are not the 
solution to fostering increased 
dialogue because too often in 
these discussions, people can be 
intimidated by the prospect of 
saying what is truly on their mind in 
the company of strangers. Rather, 
genuine, organic conversations 
between friends and classmates 
have to occur with more frequency 
so that as a community, we can 
move 
closer 
to 
permanently 

eradicating the kind of thinking 
and language that I witnessed in 
class. To my peers at Michigan, I 
implore you: Take the time to sit 
down with a friend, a classmate 
or even an acquaintance to 
reflect on racial issues, at our 
university and in our society, so 
that we are better equipped to 
solve problems relating to them 
together. These conversations 
will be difficult, but they are 
absolutely necessary.

The Michigan I know and 

love expects only the finest from 
its students. We are the “Leaders 
and the Best” for precisely 
that reason. It is up to us, and 
us alone, to ensure that this 
moniker stays accurate now and 
moving forward.

“Hostiles” by Scott Cooper 
is a paradoxically violent yet 
aesthetically gorgeous take on a 
Western classic. Captain Joseph 
J. Blocker (Christian Bale, “The 
Promise”), a seasoned military 
leader with a history of killing 
Native Americans, is ordered 
to return a Cheyenne war chief 
Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi, “Penny 
Dreadful”) back to his ancestral 

land after being a prisoner for 
years. Blocker, who attempts to 
deny the mission, is forced to 
confront his prejudices towards 
Native 
Americans 
when 
it 
becomes vital that he and Yellow 
Hawk, whom he considered 
his enemy, must band together 
to 
survive 
the 
path 
home 
against the shared antagonist 
of the Comanches. This other 
Native group, known for being 
ruthless in their indiscriminate 
slaughter, 
including 
other 
Native Americans and Rosalie 
Quaid’s (Rosamund Pike, “Gone 
Girl”) husband and three young 
daughters, which is how the 
film begins. Within the first 
five minutes, bloodshed quickly 
ensues, a signal from Cooper that 
“Hostiles” wouldn’t be pretty or 

pacifist.
Set in 1892, the movie explores 
the after-effects in an American 
Western rural panorama. This 
geographical 
landscape 
has 
historically been wrought with 
genocide, racism and ruled by 
the ideology of Manifest Destiny, 
which was attempted to justify 
white expansionism during this 
period. Despite being evidently 
racist in past crusades against 
Native Americans, Blocker is 
treated with empathy from the 
audience, and Bale’s wide range 
of emotions in his performance 
support 
the 
emotional 
complexity of his character. Bale 
recovers from prior lackluster 
roles in his portrayal of Blocker: a 
stern military man transformed 
into 
an 
unwaveringly 
loyal 
friend to his comrades. Quaid 
also merits empathy, after she 
witnesses her family’s gruesome 
murder first-hand.
From an audience standpoint, 
it is impossible to side with 
the Comanches, for they are 
heartless, but Cooper could have 
made a greater effort to frame 
the Cheyennes as sensitive and 
empathetic. Instead, they are 
painted as completely secondary 
to Blocker and his white soldiers. 
The are depicted as “othered,” 
only with a lesser degree of 
savagery than the Comanches, 
and their purpose is truly a 
reference point by which the 
whites can try to practice being 
accepting and understanding. 
Per 
usual, 
the 
narrative, 
though wavering at moments, 
sides with the whites over the 
Native Americans. Though the 
message of overcoming racism 
is necessary to fight the common 
enemy, it didn’t go far enough. 
Even though Blocker’s defense 
of the Cheyennes in the end 
of the film redeems him, what 
does that say about us if we side 

with a white soldier who has 
participated in genocide and is 
only converted in the end?
What Cooper’s film excels in is 

its stunning cinematography of 
the American Western frontier. 
The 
rolling 
hills, 
sunburnt 
canyons and vast plains remind 
us of the potential to explore our 
own forgotten pioneer: a truly 
American conviction. Moreover, 
the way the tolls of war, 
specifically PTSD and mental 
illness, are finally acknowledged 
in cinema is refreshing. 
The 
most 
provocative 
dialogue perhaps takes place 
between Blocker’s right hand 
man, Sargent Thomas Metz (Roy 
Cochrane, “Black Mass”) and 
Lieutenant Rudy Kidder (Jesse 
Plemons, “The Post”) which 
examines the way killing in war 
creates emotional numbness and 
how it becomes almost second 
nature, a feeling that Kidder 
fears. Had the film gone further 
in the emotional tolls of war and 
didn’t color the Native Americans 
as “the other,” “Hostiles” would 
have been a different film.

‘Hostiles’ isn’t pretty, but 
the scenery is stunning

BOOKS

Zadie Smith writes essays 
like a novelist. Best known for 
her lauded novels like “White 
Teeth” and “Swing Time,” the 
British author channels this 
sensibility into a compelling 
range of subjects in her new 
nonfiction 
collection 
“Feel 
Free,” 
from 
contemporary 
art to Harlem, her childhood 
bathroom to Justin Bieber.
Smith’s 
authoritative 
yet 
ambiguous 
style 
reminded 
me of last year’s eclipse: You 
could only see it clearly (and 
safely) through just the right 
filter, rather than staring at 
it head-on (as our President 
did). By taking a circuitous, 
indirect and deeply personal 
approach to her subject matter, 
Smith 
often 
hits 
essential 
truths about human nature or 
society. In doing so, she inverts 
the 
traditional 
essayist’s 
conventions. 
Rather 
than 
addressing her subject directly 
and her readers indirectly, 
she does the opposite. Smith 
arrives at the truth of her 
subject matter in a roundabout 
fashion, as skillfully as she 
draws out universal feelings 
and 
experiences 
from 
the 
everyday in her novels. But she 
addresses us directly, striving 
for an audience connection 
that often involves telling us 
to Google something, listen 
to a certain song or look up 
a YouTube video in order to 
understand what she’s talking 
about.
But all this talk of “truth” 
makes 
Smith 
sound 
stiff 
or 
philosophical 
when, 
actually, she’s pretty fun — an 
entertaining, relatable voice 
from across the pond. Like 
Roxane Gay here in the States, 
Smith deftly interweaves high 
and lowbrow topics, often in 

the same essay, shifting from 
comedians to philosophers to 
pop stars without rambling or 
trying too hard. Her essays are 
best when she has gotten very 
excited about something — she 
just read a thought-provoking 
book or saw a movie she can’t 

get out of her head — and 
needs to talk about it, to work 
through it. In trying to get to 
the bottom of something she’s 
come across, whether that’s 
Key & Peele’s comedy, Jay-Z’s 
music or an old photograph 
her father took, Smith delves 
deeper and deeper into the 
wormhole of her fascination, 
and we come out on the other 
side with her, clutching some 
gem of knowledge or insight.
In one of the last essays 
in 
the 
collection 
“Meet 
Justin Bieber!” Smith finds 

improbable, 
somehow 
inevitable 
connections 
between the famous singer and 
the dead Jewish philosopher 
Martin Buber. (Their names, 
she points out, are not just 
similar but derivatives of the 
same 
Germanic 
surname). 
Bieber and other celebrities 
struggle to be truly known, she 
says, because while they are 
“known” to millions, it’s only in 
the most superficial way: Even 
when they “meet” people, it is 
a shallow encounter, a selfie, 
an autograph, an experience 
already relegated to the past 
tense. Buber, the philosopher, 
criticized 
these 
superficial 
encounters, emphasizing the 
rarity and great effort involved 
in truly meeting someone, 
knowing them — something 
that may happen only a few 
times in a life.
In 
“Feel 
Free,” 
Smith 
seems to be trying to reach 
Buber’s 
ideal, 
constantly 
reaching 
toward 
a 
deeper 
understanding of her subject 
and a richer connection with 
her 
readers. 
Novelists 
are 
often intensely curious about 
the human condition in all its 
bounty and ugliness. In these 
essays, 
Smith 
is 
intensely 
curious about everything she 
comes across: What does it feel 
like to be Justin Bieber, signing 
thousands of autographs in a 
packed Tokyo stadium? What 
was it like to be Billie Holiday, 
on stage in her prime, in her 
decline? How is it to grow up 
biracial in Detroit? On the 
Upper West Side of New York? 
In London in the ’80s, as Smith 
herself did?
Smith 
is 
a 
nuanced, 
wonderful 
observer 
of 
humanity in all its complexity, 
and she often lands on key 
insights about our present 
time or political situation — 
in her roundabout, indirect 
way — in these essays. But

when 
she 
approaches 
this 
material 
directly, 
somehow 
it 
doesn’t 
hold 
the 
same 
unique charm or insight; she 
winds up sounding a little 
like every other “think piece” 
writer without the layered, 
labyrinthine originality of her 
best work. For this reason, 
a few of the book’s earliest 
essays on topical issues like 
Brexit, global warming and the 
perils of social media fall flat 
compared to her more textured 
pieces. When the point of 

her essay is to make a point, 
it’s just not as interesting or 
complex to read. These essays, 
which represent only a handful 
of Smith’s excellent collection, 
read like remarkably eloquent 
versions of conversations we’ve 
all had before. Maybe I’m just 
tired of reading about politics, 
or so-called “think pieces,” 
or both. In this overcrowded 
space, even Smith occasionally 
struggles to say something 
wholly new.
It seems a waste to spend 

time discussing a few so-so 
essays. This isn’t a book to 
read from page one, from start 
to finish — there’s nothing 
chronological about it. Rifle 
through 
the 
pages 
until 
you find a perfect sentence 
gleaming at you; it won’t take 
long. After all, that’s how 
Smith herself would do it. 
We’re all just passing through, 
unthinking, until we find an 
idea that arrests us, consumes 
us. Let Smith lead you down 
her rabbit hole.

WAYPOINT ENTERTAINMENT

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

In 
2013, 
a 
quiet 
album 
emerged, half-hidden and nearly 
forgotten in the grainy synth 
dystopia Kanye’s Yeezus and Daft 
Punk’s Random Access Memories 
would eventually create. Bathed 
in cool shades of grey, the 

soaring vocals and lush melodies 
beckoned. Contemplative and 
seductive, the songs lingered 
just out of reach — dreams you 
could only barely remember.
That album was Woman by 
Rhye, the joint project of singer/
songwriter Mike Milosh and 
producer Robin Hannibal. And 
even after the album garnered 
critical acclaim, Rhye continued 
to remain frustratingly out of 
the spotlight, discreetly slipping 
from one location to the next as 
they toured live, never anything 
more than a hushed murmur 
among public discourse. 
Even among the shadows, a 
lot can happen — and did happen 
— in the five years after Woman 
was first released. Milosh split 
from not only his wife, Alexa 
Nikolas, but also his original 
producer, Hannibal. Within the 
first week of the initial Rhye 
tour, he failed to meet sale 
expectations, went into debt and 
spent the next year attempting 
to recover. In order to ensure 
Rhye still had a future, Milosh 
played a total of 476 live shows. 

For him, there was misfortune 
and struggle within these past 
five years, but there was also this 
too: The experience of watching 
various 
sets 
of 
audience 
members react to his music, the 
visceral intimacy fostered by 
each distinct venue.
Rhye’s latest release, Blood, 
is based on these experiences, 
on the harmony that can be 
found in times of hardship. 
There’s an unrestrained warmth 
within these tracks, an allure 
that hasn’t existed in any of 
Rhye’s 
previous 
work. 
The 
album sparks with physicality; 
each song is allowed to explore 
its own space, both liberated 
and encouraged by Milosh’s 
delicate croon. Rhye’s dynamic 
progression enables them to peel 
back the glossy veneer that had 

encased Woman, allowing Blood 
to surface: carnal, emotive and 
aching to be felt.
This album is primal. The 

intricate beauty of a romantic 
experience — the fluttering joy 
of falling in love, the sweetly 
slow build of lust — has no place 
in Blood. Instead, there exists a 
restless sort of hunger. The near-
tangible vibrations of overdrawn 
guitar riffs in “Phoenix” climb 
into your skin. The twisting 
melodies of “Count To Five” 
intertwine and creep across a 
tremulous beat. “Sinful”’s initial 
minimalism builds into a dense 
fog of silky instrumentation and 
gasps of “We’re not alone, you’re 
my sinful.”
In many ways, Blood picks up 
right where its predecessor left 
off. The opening track, “Waste,” 
with 
its 
gauzy 
orchestral 
serenade and Milosh’s breathy 
“Oh, my love cave into this 
space,” is reminiscent of older 
songs “The Fall” and “One Of 
Those Summer Days.” Rhye 
still keeps its tempos slow, 
dragging 
periods 
of 
silence 
out until the empty spaces 
carry their own texture. The 
songs still sometimes have a 
tendency 
to 
meld 
together, 
woven into uniformity through 
insubstantial 
lyricism 
and 
barely-there 
intonation, 
constantly 
threatening 
to 
disappear completely.
Yet, despite these flawed 
similarities, Rhye’s sophomore 
album is distinctly more enticing 
than their debut. Songs are more 
organic. Rough and pleading, 
they speak to our most basic 
emotions. The profound remorse 
found in “Please” emits like a 
quiet prayer. The juice of “Taste” 
drips down the chin, sensuality 
bursting like an overripe peach.
Whereas 
Woman 
was 
structured grace, Blood is all raw 
yearning — desperate to consume 
the object of its fascination until 
there is absolutely nothing left.

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

When the curtain rose, a huge 
swell of anticipation pushed me 
up to the edge of my seat. When 
the curtain rose, the whole world 
seemed to be poised upon the 
stage. When the curtain rose, 
I was mesmerized until the 
final curtain fell. Unceasingly 
captivating, the students of the 
University’s 
Department 
of 
Dance delivered a performance 
of innovation and beauty, adding 
their own mark to the modern 
dance world.
Global guest choreographers 

Ohad Naharin and Shannon Gillen 
were brought in for this special 
performance and collaborated 
with faculty members Missy Beck 
and Sandra Torijano to produce 
four outstanding and unique 
pieces in “Dancing Globally,” 
which 
was 
performed 
last 
weekend.
It began with over 20 dancers 
dressed in black suits and top 
hats standing perfectly still in a 
semicircle stretching across the 
stage. Consisting of excerpts from 
“Kyr” (1990), “Anaphase” (1993) 
and “Mabul” (1992), the piece 
was intimidating and powerful 
— all heads slightly bowed and 
shadows cast across their faces. 
Slowly sitting only to spring into 
action, dancers bellowed chants 
in sync, then jerked and twisted 
every which way — a wave of 
motion oscillating across the 
semicircle, ending with the last 
dancer plunging to the floor. This 

sequence of sitting, screaming, 
synced movement and rises and 
falls 
repeated 
several 
times, 
building a tension that hovered 
over the audience.
I felt like I was on the stage, 
screaming with the dancers, 
jolting with them. When they 
began to fling off articles of 
clothing — hats, shoes, jackets, 
pants — I wanted to as well. I 
wanted to join them in removing 
all that weighs me down, all 
that contributes to my own 
conformity. Starting in full suits 
and ending in muted tanks and 
shorts, they seemed free from 
something. I wanted to be free as 
well.

The beauty of modern dance is 
that it is made to be interpretive. 
I see a completely different story 
than my neighbor might see. 
Interpretations are free to move 
and shift just as much as the 
dancers across the stage. Ideas 
are not confined because dance 
is not limited to words. To me, 
dance is bigger than words: It is 
movement.
The first piece ended with a 
gripping duet between a girl and a 
guy, telling a story of a contrasting 
relationship. Defying gravity and 
logic, the two moved together as 
one strong entity as their bodies 
intertwined, 
separated 
and 
glided across the stage. It left me 

feeling conflicted, at once in awe 
of their fluidity and emotional 
over the confusing state of the 
relationship.
The curtain opened to the 
second 
piece, 
“Vox” 
(2018), 
what seemed to me to be an 
innovative social commentary on 
the working class. The stage was 
extremely bare, wings were open 
and costumes were minimalistic 
and monotoned. Each dancer had 
their own gray long sleeve shirt, 
used as a prop to scrub the floor, 
sliding it across their body and 
playing off other dancers.
I wish I had three extra pairs 
of eyes to watch this piece. A 
large group of dancers — many 
moments consisted of several 
story threads in small groups of 
one, two or three dancers. And 
each thread was fascinating; 
each one conveyed some kind of 
relationship between the dancers, 
some kind of struggle or success.

They moved like a school of 
fish, flowing from one side of 
the stage to the other, tossing 
up individuals to be caught in 
the air. Perhaps it mimics how 
the working class supports each 
other, yet watches and follows the 
crowd. They are the social class 
that scrubs floors; a class confined 
to itself yet also surviving by itself.
A steady thud, thud, thud, 
thud — that is how the third 
dance, “Fall(s)” (2018) began. 
The stage was dark, and the noise 
was a mystery. My eyes slowly 
adjusted to make out some shapes 
spread across the stage. The 
whole audience concentrated on 
the noise. Lights go on, and the 

dancers jumped in sync. The 
thud was not singular; the ball of 
the foot hit just before the heel, 
creating a double thudding sound 
that lulled one into hypnosis. Like 
the first two pieces, the theme of 
conformity was very present as 
the dancers started in sync and 
quickly fell out of the jump one 
by one. An Asian influence was 
seen in the costumes wrapped 
in bright colorful strips of cloth 
and the flowery backdrop with a 
shower of running water behind 
it.
The 
finale, 
“Minutus 
Luminous” (2018), had the most 
ambiguous storyline of the night. 
But I found it amusing to make up 

a story as it progressed, letting 
it shift and change to match the 
movement. I saw a futuristic 
world of people dressed in ragged 
clothes, giving the impression of 
some kind of apocalypse or era of 
despair. Beautiful solos, duets and 
groups shined in this piece. Their 
fluid motion carried through 
time and space, playing with and 
against the music, leaving each 
leap, each wide gesture, each 
throw suspended in the air.
Across the performances, the 
most pronounced style was Gaga. 
The way I have experienced Gaga 
is very meditative; it focuses on 
feeling of the movement through 
your body, hearing the movement 
in your bones, texturizing your 
very skin as soft or thick as you 
move. Watching the performance, 
I could see the dancers exercising 
these 
ideas; 
sometimes, 
the 
movement 
appearing 
to 
be 
coming from outside their body 

and other times the movement 
rose from the center of their body, 
flowing outward.
Gaga is wild, yet defined with 
clarity, sharply contrasted with 
the common theme of conformity 
in “Dancing Globally.” When the 
curtain fell, I was filled with pure 
admiration. Yet, I was also left 
with the idea of nonconformity, 
of setting myself apart as an 
individual. Modern dance is 
an outlet for one’s voice, for 
opinions, for ideas; it is anything 
but the same. Really, I cannot 
even give modern dance an exact 
definition. It is what it wants to be 
in that singular moment, making 
it a wonder to watch every second.

‘Dancing Globally’ brings 
innovation in captivating 
Gaga-style performances

Even as a fan of the series, I have 
to admit that the best part of the 
so-called “Cloververse,” a series 
of loosely connected sci-fi horror 
anthology films produced by J.J. 
Abrams (“Star Wars: The Force 
Awakens”), is the marketing. The 
first entry, “Cloverfield,” dropped 
a cryptic trailer that showed only 
the release date and hinted at 
the found-footage monster flick 
premise with the unforgettable 
shot of the decapitated Statue of 
Liberty. Eight years later, a movie 
shot under the name “Valencia,” 
was revealed by its first trailer 
to be a sequel with the title “10 
Cloverfield Lane” just a month 
before its release. And during 
Super Bowl LII, the first preview 
for the third chapter in the series 
aired, revealing not just the title, 
“The Cloverfield Paradox,” but 
that it would be dropping on 
Netflix 
immediately 
following 
the game. It’s undeniably fun 
marketing, but in this case, it 
has the unfortunate side effect 
of overshadowing the lackluster 
movie advertised.
Before it descends into dull 
set pieces in its second half, “The 
Cloverfield Paradox” begins quite 
strong. The opening 45 minutes 
are smartly paced, have the feel of 
something new enough to excite 

yet familiar enough to relate to 
and best of all, doesn’t rely on 
jump scares to communicate its 
atmosphere. It asks intriguing 
questions not just about the 
direction of its own story but 
about the place of that story in the 
greater universe.
It’s when it tries to answer those 
questions that everything falls 
apart. True to its title, the more 
“The Cloverfield Paradox” tries 
to explain the strange happenings 
that plague the crew of Cloverfield 
Station, the less sense it makes. 
Likewise, the more viewers try 
to go down the rabbit hole of 
understanding the movie, the 
less enjoyable it becomes. It never 
reaches the heights that it does in 
the “‘Alien’ meets ‘The Shining’” 
mash-up of the first act. There’s an 
attempt to fix the monster-sized 
plot holes by having characters 
state more than once that logic 
does not dictate the events of the 
film, yet it then continues to still 
try to explain them away.
The argument will be made 
that the unintelligibility of the 
plot is a byproduct of cramming 
an existing script into a universe 
it wasn’t built for, but I’m not sure 
how true that is. “The Cloverfield 
Paradox” is a mess even without 
the subplot that loosely retells 
the events of the first film from 
a 
different 
perspective. 
It’s 
pointless, but it’s also about the 
only thing in the movie that leads 

to any sort of payoff for fans.
The only unwavering beacon 
of light that stands throughout 
the entire runtime is Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw’s (“Miss Sloane”) 
performance. From beginning to 
end, she is positively electric and 
communicates the humanity that 
the rest of the movie is missing. 
The 
decisions 
her 
character 
makes don’t always make sense, 
but she commits to the material 
and the resultant turn is well 
worth it. Chris O’Dowd (“Molly’s 
Game”) is a welcome presence as 
well, and the levity he brings to 
the proceedings makes even the 
most senseless scenes somewhat 
enjoyable. The single best line of 
the movie belongs to him.
Unfortunately, 
balancing 
their work is Elizabeth Debicki 
(“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 
2”) who somehow goes the entire 
movie without emoting once. It’s 
another case of either a director 
or 
a 
performer 
misreading 
“emotionless” 
for 
“creepy,” 
and it results in moments that 
could have been moody falling 
completely 
flat. 
The 
internal 
struggle her character undergoes 
could have been interesting with 
better treatment, but like the rest 
of the cast and the story, she too 
eventually falls prey to a critical 
lack of common sense.

‘Cloverfield’ is inconsistent

Behind Enemy Lines: Wisconsin center Ethan Happ

For the first time in two 

decades, 
the 
Wisconsin 

basketball 
program 
is 

rebuilding. After two pairs of 
Final Four and Sweet Sixteen 
appearances 
in 
the 
past 

four years, the Badgers have 
struggled from the get-go this 
season.

A drop of some degree was 

anticipated 
for 
Wisconsin. 

Gone is the steady and effective 
backcourt 
duo 
of 
Bronson 

Koenig 
and 
Zak 
Showalter. 

So is Nigel Hayes, the multi-
dimensional 
forward 
and 

former Big Ten Sixth Man of the 
Year. The trio was responsible 
for over 60 percent of the 
Badgers’ minutes last season.

Still, the level to which 

Wisconsin dropped this year 
has been surprising.

With 
an 
offense 
ranked 

312th nationally, the Badgers 
have won just three conference 
games and sit at 10-15 overall 
— on track for the program’s 
worst mark since 1998. And it’s 
only gotten worse as the season 
has drawn on. Wisconsin has 
lost four straight games and 
has fallen in seven of their last 
eight.

But the Badgers are still 

dangerous, 
mainly 
because 

of Ethan Happ. 
The 
redshirt 

junior center is 
averaging over 17 
points and eight 
rebounds 
per 

game — good for 
sixth-best in the 
Big Ten. He has 
also 
earned 
10 

double-doubles 
and expanded his 
game to include 
jump shots.

He’ll 
be 
a 
challenging 

matchup for No. 20 Michigan, 

which heads to Wisconsin for 
a 1 p.m. tip Sunday. The Daily 
sat down with Happ at Big Ten 

Media 
Day 

last 
October 

to 
discuss 

the 
Badgers’ 

transition, 
his jump shot 
and 
emerging 

stardom.

The 

Michigan Daily: 
You’ve 
played 

under 
both 

Bo Ryan and 
now Greg Gard 

during your time at Wisconsin. 
How do you compare their 

respective coaching styles?

Ethan Happ: They’re very 

similar because coach Ryan 
obviously was coach Gard’s 
mentor for how many years? I 
think coach Gard tries not to be 
as temperative as coach Ryan 
was. I feel like (Ryan) lost it a 
little quicker. When you messed 
up, all hell broke loose. So I 
think coach Gard tries to make 
it a staple of him, to stay calm 
even through tough moments.

Both ways are very effective. 

Coach Ryan was very successful 
with what he did. Coach Gard 
has been successful with what 
he’s done. I think as long as 
you’re consistent so your players 

know what to expect, that’s big.

TMD: Bronson Koenig and 

Nigel Hayes were two long-
time players that become the 
faces of Wisconsin basketball. 
What have you learned in the 
early stages of stepping into 
their former roles?

EH: The biggest thing is 

action 
more 
than 
vocals. 

Anybody can say the right 
things to be a leader. But I think 
really what’s the true testament 
is what you do on the court: If 
you’re the hardest worker in a 
drill. If you know all the plays 
to a tee and the other spots on 
the play — things like that. A 
freshman or sophomore looks 

up to you and says, ‘Hey, what 
do I do on this play’ or ‘Oh, he’s 
going that hard in that drill? 
I better do the 
same thing.’

TMD: 
Much 

has been made 
about 
your 

development of a 
jump shot. How 
do you balance 
that with your 
presence in the 
post?

EH: The media 

makes 
a 
big 

deal 
about 
me 

shooting the ball, but I’ll still 
be in the paint. That is where 

I help the team the most, and 
that’s where I’m most effective 
is down low. If I can draw 
double-teams in, that’s what 
we want to do. But at the same 
time, if I can take upon and pull 
defenses out, that’s what I’m 
going to do as well.

TMD: How’s your jump shot 

itself changed since last season?

EH: 
It’s 
definitely 
taken 

steps forward. I don’t expect to 
come into the season shooting 
60 percent on jump shots, but 
I’ll set a goal, hit that and keep 
going from there.

TMD: What do you make 

of the reduced expectations 
that your team has this season 
with the losses of Bronson 
Koenig, 
Nigel 
Hayes 
(and) 

Zak Showalter? Those lower 
expectations 
are 
something 

you’ve never really had at 
Wisconsin, right?

EH: I’m not happy about 

losing the talent, but I’m happy 
that the expectations on us 
are drawn back. Last year, we 
were supposed to win the Big 
Ten, and we got everybody’s 
best game. You never get an 
easy game in the Big Ten, but 
hopefully we have a game like, 
‘Oh Wisconsin? We’re fine.’ 
Hopefully, we get those games 
a couple times.

TMD: What about the big 

expectations put on yourself? 

How 
are 
you 

handling those?

EH: You just 

can’t take it too 
seriously. 
I’m 

going to have 
bad games. I’m 
going to miss 
shots. 
There 

will 
be 
times 

where 
I 
turn 

the 
ball 
over, 

and that’s just 
part of playing 

the game. That’s what happens 
when I have the ball this much.

Harbaugh dishes on transfers

National Signing Day was 

mostly 
uneventful 
for 
Jim 

Harbaugh and Michigan.

The 
Wolverines 
added 

three new players to the 2018 
recruiting class after signing 
the bulk of their class during 
the new early signing period 
in December. They also lost 
the headliner of their class, 
Otis Reese, to Georgia after the 
four-star linebacker had been 
committed for nearly two years.

The three new recruits — 

Ronnie Bell, Vincent Gray and 
Michael Barrett — aren’t the 
only 
new 
names 
Michigan 

will welcome into the fold 
though. 
Junior 
quarterback 

Shea Patterson will join the 
team after spending two years 
at Ole Miss, while fifth-year 
senior defensive back Casey 
Hughes decided to take a grad 
transfer from Utah and join the 
Wolverines. Michigan is also 
currently in pursuit of fifth-
year senior left tackle Calvin 
Anderson, who took an official 
visit recently to Ann Arbor and 
is reportedly deciding between 
the Wolverines and Texas.

There’s certainly a chance 

that members of the 2018 class 
could contribute as early as next 
season. But Michigan’s new 
transfers are more than likely 
to see the field, though it’s still 
currently 
unknown 
whether 

Patterson will be eligible.

The quarterback is currently 

in the midst of an appeal to the 
NCAA for immediate eligibility, 
with the argument that Ole 
Miss misled recruits and players 
during an ongoing investigation 
— an investigation that resulted 
in several penalties, including 
a bowl ban and scholarship 
reductions, for the Rebels.

Harbaugh was asked at his 

press conference Wednesday 
afternoon about whether he had 
an update on the appeal process, 
and his answer was blunt.

“No,” he said. “I don’t have 

any update on the calendar.”

While Patterson’s status for 

next year is still up in the air, 
Michigan’s 
other 
incoming 

transfer is certain to have 
immediate 
eligibility. 
Where 

he’ll fit in the secondary, though, 
remains to be seen.

“Yeah, another thing to be 

determined,” 
Harbaugh 
said 

when asked about Hughes. “(I) 
think he has the ability to be 
a corner. Also has the ability 
by what compiles our best 
secondary to be a nickel or be a 
safety. Think he’s got the ability 
to play all three of those, and 
we’ll determine that when he 
gets here.

“Coverage 
ability 
plus 

tackling abilities. He’s made 
quite a few tackles, and he’s a 
strong tackler.”

Hughes started 11 games this 

past season for the Utes, tallying 
35 tackles, two forced fumbles 
and one pass breakup. 

Michigan still switching up lineup late in season

With just three series left in 

the regular season, Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson is still 
keeping his lineup in flux.

The 19th-ranked Wolverines 

(8-10-2 
Big 
Ten, 
13-13-

2 overall) — No. 16 in the 
PairWise rankings — have 
gotten heavy production from 
their top forward line of junior 
Cooper Marody and seniors 
Tony Calderone and Dexter 
Dancs. With 78 points between 
them to date, it’s undeniable 
the trio has been a dominant 
force on offense.

“We’ve got some guys here; 

you know what they’re gonna 
do 
every 
night,” 
Pearson 

said on Wednesday. “As Red 
(Berenson) always said, they’ve 
put money in the bank, they’ve 
made the deposits. They want 
to take a thousand dollars; 
they’ve got enough there.

“But other guys haven’t put 

money in the bank, they can’t 
take a thousand dollars out.”

And at the outset of the 

season, 
it 
seemed 
as 
if 

Michigan 
was 
completely 

reliant on its top line.

However, some mid-season 

stagnation 
disrupted 
the 

system, and Pearson had to 
get creative with his lines, and 
who would populate them.

Since 
that 
point, 
the 

Wolverines 
can 
only 
be 

described as eclectic.

As a testament to their 

versatility, freshmen forwards 
Jack Becker and Dakota Raabe 
combined for three goals this 
past weekend against then-No. 
18 Wisconsin.

Clearly 
Michigan 
is 

allowing, encouraging even, 
upward 
movement 
in 
the 

lineup for solid play. And 
that’s highlighted by Becker 
and 
Raabe’s 
outstanding 

performances in the past two 
weeks.

On Saturday, Raabe and 

Becker played on the third 
and fourth lines, respectively, 
which proves their offensive 
contribution to the system isn’t 
going unnoticed.

However, 
as 
teams 

transition into the postseason, 
they usually have a perfect 
idea of who they can go to for 
points and what their lineup 
will be.

“As far as that goes, you are 

what you are,” Pearson said. 
“I think now we should have 
a pretty good idea of who you 
are and what your lineup is, 
and who can do what.

“Now having said that, some 

of the younger guys have made 
some steps, so it allows you to 
test some things a little bit.”

Save for injuries, it’s rare to 

see a team completely switch 
up its lineup before massive 
end-of-season matchups.

“You 
get 

down 
to 
the 

time 
of 
the 

year now when 
you 
don’t 
get 

many 
more 

opportunities,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“With 
each 

game, 
the 

implications 
grow.”

According to 

the PairWise, Wolverines sit at 
the last possible place to make it 
into to the NCAA Tournament. 
Why would Pearson switch his 
lineup around now with such 
high stakes?

The answer is that he wants 

to foster an environment in 
which anyone can earn a spot 

at the forefront of the offense.

And that has seemed to 

work through this point in the 
season, as players like Becker 
and 
Raabe 
– 
even 
junior 

defenseman Joe Cecconi, who 
contributed a goal to this 
weekend’s offensive effort – 
have been putting up much-
needed numbers.

“I think a lot of guys are 

stepping up that weren’t at 
the beginning of the year,” 

Calderone said 
Wednesday. 
“So 
they’re 

getting 
more 

opportunities 
and everything, 
and 
I 
think 

there’s 
a 
lot 

of 
excitement 

around 
the 

room; 
there’s 

so 
much 

competition to 

get out on a line, and I think 
that’s overall better for our 
team.”

In its upcoming matchup 

against 
Michigan 
State 
— 

bottom-dwellers in the Big Ten 
— Michigan has a perfect time 
for its non-performers to move 
into the performers category.

Harbaugh, Michigan looking to fill 10th assistant spot on coaching staff

While the Michigan football 

team finalized a new class of 
signees, one group on the team 
could still use a little more depth.

The coaching staff, as of 

Wednesday, has filled just nine 
of the 10 available spots for full-
time assistants — despite the 
10th having been temporarily 
filled just a month ago.

Jim 
Harbaugh 
had 
hired 

Arkansas’ 
Dan 
Enos 
as 
an 

offensive assistant coach soon 
after the regular season ended, 
only to have Enos snatched away 
by Nick Saban and Alabama a 
few weeks later.

Harbaugh said he is currently 

interviewing candidates for the 
vacant spot, and the new hire 
will be “focused on the offensive 
side.” Harbaugh hopes to finish 

the hiring process soon, because 
spring practices begin March 22.

Rumors circulated online that 

former Florida head coach Jim 
McElwain had been linked with 
the available offensive assistant 
spot. 
McElwain 
was 
fired 

from Florida this season after 
a disastrous year. The Gators 
ranked 109th in total offense, but 
many still consider McElwain a 
strong coach. As of now, though, 
the 
McElwain 
rumors 
are 

nothing more than rumors.

A recent hire, Ed Warriner, 

joined Michigan just a few days 
ago as an offensive analyst. His 
title as an “analyst” extends 
beyond the 10 available “assistant 
coach” spots, meaning he isn’t 
allowed to directly coach the 
players, participate in practices 
or contribute to off-campus 
recruiting.

Harbaugh praised Warriner, 

who 
previously 
worked 
for 

Minnesota as an offensive line 
coach and run-game coordinator, 
and said that he feels like they 
are “becoming best friends.”

The two other new faces to the 

program include Sherrone Moore 
and Al Washington. Moore will 
serve as the new tight ends coach, 
and Washington as a defensive 
assistant. Washington has not 
been assigned a specific position 
group yet at Michigan, but 
previously served as a defensive 
line coach at Cincinnati.

“We’re 
thrilled 
with 
the 

new 
additions,” 
Harbaugh 

said. 
“Sherrone 
Moore, 
Al 

Washington, I think they’re 
fantastic.”

Harbaugh said he had a 

chance to sit in on offensive and 
defensive meetings with both 
coaches while traveling and 
thought they were tremendous.

Outside 
of 
the 
on-field 

coaching and analyst spots, one 
of Harbaugh’s other new hires 
is Ben Herbert, Michigan’s new 
strength and conditioning coach. 
Herbert worked 
for 
11 
seasons 

at 
Wisconsin 

before spending 
five years with 
Arkansas. 
He 

joined 
the 

Wolverines 
in 

early January.

“Coach 

Herbert 
and 

the 
staff 
are 

extremely hard-
working, 
very 
detailed 
and 

have hit the ground running,” 
Harbaugh said. “It’s early, but I 
already see positive results. What 
went into that was interviewing 
multiple interested coaches, and 
I really thought we got the right 

man for the right position.”

All in all, Michigan’s coaching 

staff hasn’t changed too much 
at the top. Both the offensive 
and 
defensive 
coordinators, 

Tim 
Drevno 

and Don Brown, 
are staying put. 
Passing 
game 

coordinator 
and 
assistant 

head coach Pep 
Hamilton 
is 

sticking with the 
program as well.

Michigan’s 

former 
safeties 

coach 
Brian 

Smith departed for a defensive 
coordinator position at Rice back 
in December, but Harbaugh said 
he doesn’t anticipate any other 
coaches leaving.

The quick departure of Enos, 

though, will likely leave the 

program with a bitter taste — 
at least until it announces a 
10th coach. Enos had offensive 
success with his previous teams, 
something 
Michigan 
clearly 

struggled with in 2017.

Harbaugh didn’t go into detail 

about Enos’ short-lived tenure, 
but he offered a few thoughts on 
the state of the offense and how 
he’s handling the situation.

“On offense right now, we are 

going through a self-scout period 
and looking at ways to get our 
offense up to where our defense 
is,” Harbaugh said.

Enos won’t be on the sideline 

to help Michigan get its offense 
up to speed, but if Harbaugh 
can pull off a big name hire — 
preferably one with a history 
of offensive success — that 
could silver line what has been 
an 
otherwise 
disappointing 

offseason so far.

The Wolverines have seen three staff departures this offseason as Brian Smith, Greg Frey and Dan Enos all moved on

“Sherrone Moore, 

Al Washington, 

I think they’re 

fantastic.”

Hallie Thome looked around 

and realized there were no other 
options. The shot clock was 
winding down, there was nobody 
near her and — with Northwestern 
having pulled within single digits 
to start the final quarter — the 
pressure was on. For the first time 
all year, the junior center rose and 
fired from beyond the arc. She 
nailed it.

“Our bench was up standing, 

keeping us aware of the time (on 
the shot clock), and so they’re 
screaming, like, ‘Six, five’ and I see 
everyone just running around,” 
Thome said. “I said, ‘You know 
what, my feet are set, just shoot it, 
Hallie.’

“ … My grandpa will be so proud. 

He calls me after every game and 
he will be like, ‘You need to watch 
the film. You have an open 3.’ I’m 
like, ‘Grandpa, I’m not shooting a 
3.’ ”

The absurdity of Thome taking 

her first triple of the season in 
such a situation did all that was 
necessary to relax the Michigan 
women’s basketball team, and 
the game quickly got out of hand. 
Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
hit a 3-pointer, then another one. 
An 11-point lead became 15. A 
potential loss — one which would 
have been Michigan’s third in a 
row — became a 21-point, 84-63 
win, barely a blip on the radar in 
the throes of the season. There’s 
a comfort in normalcy, and the 
21st-ranked 
Wolverines 
(9-4 

Big Ten, 20-6 overall) found its 
embrace on Thursday.

“The world (was) coming to 

an end last week,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “You 
know, you lose two games, holy 
cow we hit a little bump in the 
road. But it’s nice to see that our 
kids responded tonight, and we had 
some confidence.”

Thome carried the load early, 

fighting off double-teams and 
knocking in an array of hook shots 
and turnaround jumpers from the 
post. Though the Wildcats kept 

it close during the first quarter, 
Thome gave Michigan the lead just 
as the period ended, swallowing 
Lindsay Pulliam’s shot whole, 
leading Flaherty to an and-one 
transition layup.

Despite only five first quarter 

points, Flaherty made up for it 
by dropping 31 in the next three, 
finishing with a season-high 36. If 
the early goings were a showcase 
for Thome, the rest was a display 
of Flaherty’s dominance — the 
basketball version of a Maori war 
dance.

She hit one off a dribble-handoff 

from Thome, then another off an 
offensive rebound from senior 
forward Jillian Dunston, then 
another, pulling up after Dunston 
reversed the direction of a screen to 
open up space. For good measure, 
she added two more before the first 
half was over.

During the week, Barnes Arico 

emphasized getting Flaherty open 
off screens in practice, especially to 
Dunston.

“If your girl’s gonna run to the 

paint, that means every single time, 
you can get Katelynn an open shot, 
at least for a hair of a second,” she 
told her. “And if you do, she’s going 
to be able to knock that down.”

Northwestern 
didn’t 
have 

much of an answer for Flaherty 

last Monday in Evanston, when 
she scored 27 on 10-of-21 shooting. 
They never found one Thursday. 
The Wildcats’ adjustment was a 
collective shoulder shrug, as she 
caroused to nine three-pointers. 
Not to be outdone, Thome finished 
with 25 points on 8-of-12 shooting 
from the field, along with five 
rebounds and a season-high four 
blocks.

“People were doubling in the 

post on Hallie and face-guarding 
Katelynn the entire game,” Barnes 
Arico said. “But they can’t do that 
without their teammates getting 
good screens and recognizing them 
when they’re open. And I thought 
that’s where we really took steps in 
the right direction tonight, is being 
able to find them and get them 
touches when they were open.”

The Wolverines were on the 

ropes heading into this game, 
having lost two straight with 
two consecutive road games and 
a home contest against No. 10 
Maryland coming up. This was the 
game they had to win, no ifs, ands 
or buts about it, and win they did.

“You go into the motions when 

you start winning a lot of games,” 
Flaherty said. “And I think these 
past two days especially, we really 
came in, worked hard and I think 
our confidence is back.”

Hallie Thome: Michigan’s second option

With 36 points on Thursday, 

senior guard Katelynn Flaherty led 
the team in scoring – again. That’s 
the way it always is.

But 
center 
Hallie 
Thome 

wasn’t too bad herself in the No. 
21 Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s 
84-63 
victory 
over 

Northwestern. The junior finished 
with 25 points, the second most in 
the game.

With a teammate in Flaherty 

– one of the nations most prolific 
scorers and the program’s all-
time leading scorer – Thome’s 
offensive production can often get 
overlooked. It’s easy to forget that 
she’s finished second in scoring 
for the Wolverines each of the last 
three seasons and ranks eighth in 
program history.

This 
isn’t 
something 
that 

necessarily bothers Thome. She’s 
confident in her role.

“It never gets frustrating being 

the second scorer – not at all,” 
Thome said. “When you have a 
person like Katelynn Flaherty on 
your team, you get her the ball.”

In the shadow of Flaherty, 

Thome’s notoriety as a scorer is 
certainly repressed. In fact, she’s 
not just adequate offensively, but 

one of the biggest threats in the Big 
Ten. With 16.9 points per game, 
Thome ranks 10th in the conference 
in scoring.

What makes Thome special isn’t 

just that she scores, but how she 
does it. Thome shoots an efficient 
63.1 percent from the field – second-
best in the Big Ten. For comparison, 
Michigan’s second best player from 
the floor, Kayla Robbins, shoots 48.6 
percent.

That was on full display against 

the Wildcats, as Thome finished 
8-for-12 from the field. But Thome 
refuses to take all the credit for her 
success.

“I think (my efficiency) is all my 

teammates,” Thome said. “It’s a 
testimony to my teammates to put 
me in position to score. My coaches 
and 
teammates 
have 
instilled 

confidence in me, so whenever 
I get the ball I feel like I have an 
opportunity to score.”

So how is Thome such an 

efficient player? She has impeccable 
shot 
selections, 
rarely 
forcing 

things. The 6-foot-5 center doesn’t 
have 
to. 
Thome 
consistently 

positions herself in down low, using 
her height advantage to get high-
percentage shots.

“She’s really the total package,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “She has great size. She has 

soft hands, she catches everything 
that comes her way. Her footwork 
is so good (that) her moves around 
the basket are tough to stop. She 
showed that tonight.”

Her height gives defenders 

trouble, resulting in Thome getting 
fouled often. As a result, she gets to 
the free throw line at a high rate. 
After going 8-for-9 on Thursday, she 
has the second most attempts on the 
team at a 113, shooting 77 percent 
from the line. But even from the foul 
line, Thome pales in comparison 
to Flaherty, who has attempted 
and made more free throws on the 
season (105 for 120).

Thome’s 
time 
is 
coming, 

however.

With 
Flaherty 
graduating 

after the season, Thome naturally 
becomes the number one scoring 
option for the Wolverines. And 
Michigan will need her to fill the 
void that Flaherty leaves.

While Thome won’t replicate 

the play or offensive output of the 
5-foot-7 Flaherty, she does possess 
the talent to become the focal 
point of the offense. Still, she will 
need to diversify her game. This 
would include further developing a 
mid-range shot, thus allowing the 
Wolverines to stretch the floor.

Thursday 
night 
may 
have 

foreshadowed a transformation 
to come, as Thome hit the first 
3-pointer of her career. The shot 
came in the fourth quarter, as the 
shot clock expired during a 6-0 
Northwestern run. The shot will 
certainly make Thome’s grandpa 
happy, who calls her after every 
game and urges her to shoot it from 
behind the arc.

“It was a critical shot,” Barnes 

Arico said. “I think we were up 
eight, and that put us up 11. Hallie 
has such tremendous touch. She is 
a really good shooter. Her grandpa, 
every time he sees me, tells me how 
many threes she should be taking. 
So when we do our practice shooting 
drills, I’m like, ‘Can you make these 
so we can make grandpa proud?’ ”

While 
Flaherty 
might 
get 

the attention, Michigan would 
undoubtedly be a shell of itself 
without Thome.
