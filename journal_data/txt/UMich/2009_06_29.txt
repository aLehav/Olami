aid In
danger
State may erase
Promise Scholarship
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
Michigan college students
could be forced into an even more
difficult financial situation - one
that already includes increasing
tuition rates for the state's pub-
lic universities and an economic
recession - if the government
passes a bill to eliminate the
Michigan Promise Scholarship.
The state House of Represen-
tatives is currently reviewing
the hill, which would eliminate
funding for the Promise Schol-
arship - a $t40,000 merit-hosed
scholarship distributed to more
than 96,000 college students in
Michigan.
The Promise Scholarship was
created in December 2006 when
Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed
it into law. By passing a certain
level on the Michigan Merit
Exam or successfully completing
two years of postsecondary edu-
cation, students attending college
in Michigan could receive up to
$4,000 in tuition aid from the
grant.
But, in an attempt to cut down
the state's estimated $1.7 bil-
lion budget deficit for the fiscal
year that starts Oct. 1, the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee on
Higher Education passed a bill
that calls for an end to the schol-

Students will pay
additional $622 in
annual tuition
By LARA ZADE
Managing NewsEditor
In a rare 6-2 vote, the University
Board of Regents passed a 5.6-per-
cent tuition rate increase for both
in-state and out-of-state University
undergraduates for the 2009-2010
academic year at its June 18 meet-
ing.
The rate increase will bring the
annual cost of tuition to $11,659 for
in-state undergraduates in the Col-
lege of Literature, Science and the

Arts and $34,937 for out-of-state
undergraduates.
The tuition rate figure repre-
sents a $622 increase in annual
tuition for an in-state undergradu-
ate and an additional $1,868 for an
out-of-state undergraduate.
The regents also approved a 5.6-
percent increase for students in the
Rackham School of Graduate Stud-
ies, a 6.7-percent increase for stu-
dents attending the University of
Michigan-Dearborn and a 6.5-per-
cent increase for the Flint campus.
University Provost Teresa Sul-
livan described the increase -
which is the same as last year's rate
increase for in-state and out-of-
state undergraduate students - as
modest compared to other public
institutions in the Big Ten.

"This represents an average rate
of growth and tuition that's been
among the lowest of public univer-
sities in Michigan and also in the
Big Ten," Sullivan said.
Not all public institutions have
approved tuition rates for under-
graduatestudentsforthe2009-2010
academic year. But, Michigan State
University approved a rare two-
year budget plan, which includes
a 5.2-percent tuition increase for
the upcoming academic year and
a 4.9-percent increase for the next
academic year.
If MSU receives federal stimulus
dollars, the tuition rate increase for
this fall could be reduced to about
2.5 percent.

arship and other college financial
aid programs.
During the 2007-2008 school
year, 3,152 students at the Universi-
ty received money from the Promise
Scholarship. Numbers are not avail-
able for the 2008-2009 school year
because students have until Nov. 15
to certify the scholarship.
Pamela Fowler, executive finan-
cial aid director for the University,
said the University will try to find
additional funding for need-based
students to compensate for the
scholarship if the bill is passed.
"The University of Michigan
meets the full need of students,"
Fowler said. "If students need the
$1,000, the University will find
resources to meet that need."
But Fowler said students receiv-
ing the Promise Scholarship would
lose all funding if they are not
already eligible for financial aid.
"We will cover the costs for stu-
dents.who have need," Fowler said.

"We have no intention to do other-
wise.We willnot cover students who
do not qualify for need-based aid."
Michael Boulus, executive direc-
tor of the Presidents' Council, a lob-
bying group for the state's public
universities, said cutting the Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship would put
a lot of financial strain on families
who depend on the scholarship
money.
"It's going to unfortunately add
pressure and debt to students' higher
education costs," Boulus said."I know
there are a lot of Michigan families
quite concerned and counting onthat
aid that's been already earned."
Heather Quillen, a sophomore
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, was awarded $2,500 from
the Promise Scholarship. She said
she depends on that money to help
pay for her education.
"If they decide to cut (the schol-
arship) then it will make it very dif-
ficult for me to go back to school in
the fall," Quillen said.
Quillen - who has not been able
to find a job because of the state of
Michigan's economy - said she

doesn't know how she would come
up with the extra money.
"Hopefully I can find a job and
work so I can get the money, and if
not, my family will have to cut back
on expenses a lot so we can pay the
amount," she said.
Lori Vedder, vice president of the
Michigan Financial Aid Student
Association and director of financial
aid at the University of Michigan-
Flint, said removing the Michigan
Promise Scholarship could affect
enrollment at the University and
other schools in the state.
"You could have a needy family
that it's going to impact greaterthan
a student whose family may have
the potential to fund the tuition bill
at an institution," Vedder said.
LSA sophomore Katie Donald-
son will have received $4,000 from
the scholarship by graduation. She
said she wouldn'tbe impacted if the
money were taken away because her
family pays for her tuition. But, she
is aware that other students aren't
so lucky.
"Personally it wouldn't affect me
that much, but I know I have friends
who really depend on it who aren't
as financially stable or have to pay
for college on their own," she said.
Boulus said Michigan universi-
ties are trying to do whatever they
can to protect students from the
financial crisis.
"Everysingleuniversity,asthey're
setting their budget and tuition for
next year, are also increasing their

financial aid," Boulus said.
On June 16, the University Board
of Regents approved a budget that
included $118 million in financial
aid,which is an11.7-percent increase
in undergraduate financial aid.
Despite the increase in aid, Bou-
lus said the government needs to
find a source of revenue so that
scholarships are not cut from the
state budget.
"It's called the promise grant for
a reason, and the Senate's action
would literally break the promise
scholarship to about 100,000 stu-
dents," Boulus said.
"The fact of the matter is the state
can'tcutits way through this budget
mess it's in," he added. "Until they
start addressing the tough issues on
findingmore revenue and reforming
Michigan's tax system, they're going
to continue to play chicken with the
budget to avoid hard choices."
Boulus said he believes the gov-
ernment may have no option but to
pass the bill.
"If they don't raise revenue, they
have no choice but to make the cuts
that the Senate (presented)," he said.
Vedder said University officials
must wait for the decision before
taking action.
"There is a lot of discussion going
on, and we have to trust our lawmak-
ers to make the right decision for our
students here in Michigan," she said.
"We're going to keep monitoring it,
and as soon as we know something
our students will know something."

STUDENT BUSINESS
'U' entrepreneurs thrivein A2

Student-run
TechArb hosts 10
start-up businesses
By TORREY JOSEPH
ARMSTRONG
Daily StaffReporter
A group of University student
entrepreneurs has created an inno-
vative business incubator in down-
town Ann Arbor to share ideas,
advice and resources with other
enterprising students.
The incubator, called TechArb,
is composed of thirty students run-
ning 10 small start-up businesses
and will occupy the basement of
Tally Hall, a vacant building on Lib-
erty Street, until August.
TechArb, aims to pool resources
and create a centralized community
for student entrepreneurs, according
to co-founder and College of Engi-
neering senior Jason Bornhorst.
Bornhorst is also co-founder and
group manager of Maize Ventures,
a networking group for student-run
businesses. He pursued the space
for TechArh with other student

entrepreneurs after his previous
business, CampusRoost, Inc. - an
online social network built around
student housing - became diffi-
cult to operate once normal classes
resumed inthe fall of 2008.
TechArb was created when Ann
Arbor venture capital firm RPM
Ventures and Ann Arbor real estate
company McKinley, Inc. allowed
Bornhorst and a few students from
RPM's 10-week summer entrepre-
neurial internship program to use
the space.
Brett Wejrowski, College of Engi-
neering senior and co-founder of
Maize Ventures, was participating
in RPM's internship when he joined
the incubator.
"I was going to school and trying
to run a small web development busi-
ness at the same time, and trying to
find like-minded people," he said.
Wejrowski and others pitched
in to build permanent furniture
and set up a network to prepare the
space for use.
"In one week's time, we went
from a grassroots thing to people
actually working and running
companies down here (in the base-
mentt" Bornhorst said."The really

cool part is that there was no one
developer - just a bunch of people
and ideas - and it developed."
Several of the businesses have
had success and exposure since
joining the incubator. Mobil33t,
an iPhone application developer,
recently released DoGood - an
application that encourages people,
to do random acts of kindness. Since
its release on June 8, the application
has been downloaded more than
10,000 times.
Other businesses include
MyBandStock.com, a venture that
allows music fans to invest directly
in their favorite artists, and Shep-
herd Intelligent Systems, a public
transportation tracking website
conceived and developed under the
name Magic Bus.
Carrier Mobile, Phonagle LLC,
Troubadour Mobile and Quazie.net
are also start-up businesses that spe-
cialize in mobile phone applications.
Bornhorst and Wejrowski said
that the incubator is a temporary
endeavor, as the space's free lease
will expire in August 2009. They
hope to find University and com-
munity support in the fall, either in
the form of snace, money or other

Students can't afford more tuition hikes

theviewsoftheir authors.
Low-income letdown
City shouldn't let project for affordable housing stagnate
It's no secret that students pay through the nose to secure housing
near campus. But permanent, low-income city residents face simi-
larly inflated housing prices. Low-income housing has become less
and less available for residents and students alike. A proposal to turn one
of three government-owned properties downtown into cheap and conve-
nient housing was supposed to offer some relief for low-income residents.
But a disturbing lack of attention and support from Washtenaw County
commissioners has brought this plan to a halt, possibly permanently. City
and county officials need to renew their commitment to providing resi-
dents with the affordable, dense housing they require.

Two weeks ago, the Board of
Regents upheld a yearly ritual
and raised the cost of tuition.
But this year's 5.6-percent hike
was accompanied by a surpris-
ing break with tradition - for
the first time in three years, the
vote wasn't unanimous. While it
appears that at least some of the
regents are beginning to under-
stand that escalatingtuition rates
are unacceptable, students will
still have to contend with anoth-
er significant hike. By raising
tuition yet again, the University
is failing to provide accessible
higher education to everyone - a
failure that can only be remedied
by doing whatever it takes to
make the cost of a college educa-
tion affordable again.
At their June 18 meeting, the
Board of Regents voted 6-2 to
approve another 5.6-percent
increase inatuition for most stu-
dents for the 2009-2010 academ-
ic year. This means that in-state
tuition for students in the College
of Literature, Science and the
Arts is now $11,660 a year - 20
percent higher than it was three
years ago. Regents Julia Dar-
low (D-Ann Arbor) and Denise
Ilitch (D-Bingham Farms) voted
against the increase, the first
such votes in three years.
Darlow and Ilitch's votes rep-
resent a positive change, but the
voting procedures of the Board of
Regents are still a problem. The
serious debate over the budget
occurred out of public view, as it
does every year. This is a flawed
way of making University deci-
sions, and it casts the tuition hike
in an even darker light.
But it's still the hike itself that
merits the most criticism. In this
slumping economy, most families
are experiencing increased finan-
cial burdens, which means fewer

dollars to put toward their kids'
college education. Though the
approved budget includes a com-
mendable increase of 11.7 percent
in financial aid funded by private
donors, high tuition costs are
still a problem for middle class
students who don't necessarily
qualify for financial aid.
It's impossible not to balk at
the regents' budget, especially
when it includes expenditures
like the continued hiring of 100
faculty members. Maintaining
an excellent faculty is certainly
important, but the need for such
increases seems doubtful when
the consequence is an unafford-
able situation for students.
The University administration
cites dwindling-financial support
from the state as a reason for the
increase. It's true that the state
government has a responsibility
to fund its institutions of higher
education, and that maintaining
academic excellence is a key to
remedying the state's financial
plight. But the University's pro-
jection of a $10.4 million funding
cut is simply that - a projection.
Two years ago, when the Uni-
versity raised tuition on the pre-
text of a projected funding loss,
the projection turned out to be
lower than the amount that the
state eventually provided. Stu-
dents were never refunded for this
mistake. So while the state should
make an effortto provide adequate
funding for higher education, the
final responsibilityultimatelyrests
with the University.
The University has failed
this responsibility. With every
increase, a college education
becomes a less realistic option
for countless students. While the
country is in financial turmoil,
affordable education is more nec-
essary than ever.

Six months ago, community
development officials proposed
the conversionofone ofthree city-
or county-owned lots into 60 to
100 low-income housing units for
residents displaced by the closing
of a local YMCA. Approximately
80 percent of the proposed con-
versions' cost could be paid for by
federal tax credits, which the city
is eligible for because the large
number of students - many of
whom are still dependent on their
parents or work only part-time -
inflates the area's unemployment
rate. The target occupants for
the housing would be those who
earn about 10 to 15 percent of the
area's median income.
But according to a June 24
article by the Ann Arbor News
titled "Plan to create low-in-
come housing in downtown
Ann Arbor stalled," the project's
progress has stalled indefinitely.
The problem seems to stem from
the inability of county commis-

sioners to agree on which lot to
develop. Controversy over the
location has allowed city and
county officials to display a lack
of interest, which seems to have
derailed the project. And a lack
of public outcry has allowed offi-
cials to easily sidestep the issue.
An apparent lack of communi-
cation among local officials also
seems to be contributing to the
stagnation of the project. The offi-
cials working on the project don't
seem to have reached a consen-
sus about the project's status. But
that doesn't mean this necessary
project should be abandoned, and
the officials in charge need to step
up to make it happen.
Expensive downtown housing
pushes low-income residents and
students outside the city limits.
Not only does this segregate resi-
dents from more modest means,
but it also forces them to deal
with a more expensive commute.
This project has the opportu-
LIKE WHAT YOU SEE HERE?

nity to increase the diversity of
downtown Ann Arbor with stu-
dents and low-income residents
alike. Yet city and county offi-
cials seem reluctant to make any
headway toward this goal.
And since University students
make it easier for the city to get
federal cash, it stands to reason
that the students should be able
to profit from that gain, too. But
the local government hasn't even
been able to provide housing for
its permanent residents. Until it
does, students will be left out in
the cold.
With the closing of the YMCA
and rising housing rates, Ann
Arborresidents arehard-pressed
to find affordable housing. The
city has the power and money
to change this, but instead of
doing so, it has dithered about
location, stalling the project. It's
time for the city to revive this
flat-lining project and provide
for its residents.

It's not easy going green

Climate change. Throughout
the past two decades, those
two words have gone from
a little-known
phrase used by
environmental-
ists to part of our '
everyday culture. ,
According to the "
Intergovern- t
mental Panel on
Climate Change, PATRICK
the lengthy list of ZABAWA
problems caused
by a warming
earth includes melting ice caps
that cause ocean levels to rise and
force millions of people out of their
homes, a reduction in the supply
of drinkable water and increased
adverse health effects. And the IPCC
believes that human activity is play-
ing a big part in our planet's warm-
ing. Climate change has become a
serious concern, and many believe
it's our job to stop it.
With the escalating attention
that climate change has received,
the U.S. government is finally
doing something about it. On Fri-
day, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives passed legislation that would

drastically reduce the U.S.'s carbon
dioxide emissions, which the IPCC's
research has shown to be warming
Earth's atmosphere.
But what if this legislation
causes the exact same problems
it's tryingto fix?
The legislation is a conglomera-
tion of various methods to combat
climate change, includingideas like
mandating that 15 percent of the
nation's energy come from green
power sources such as solar and
wind by the year 2020 and enforc-
ing strict energy-efficient building
codes. The core of the bill is a cap-
and-trade system that limits the
amount of carbon dioxide compa-
nies can emit. Companies will ini-
tially have permits that allow them
to emit carbon dioxide legally, but
the number of permits will decrease
over time. As this happens, compa-
nies will be forced to purchase the
costly permits to emit carbon diox-
ide from each other, givingthem an
incentive to emit less.
With less carbon dioxide being
emitted into the atmosphere if the
new legislation becomes law, the
threat of climate change will be
lessened. But what are the mone-

tary costs of this legislation? Green
power production is more expen-
sive than producingelectricity from
carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuels.
And green energy production cur-
rently accounts for only about 2.5
percent of all energy production in
the United States, according to the
U.S. government's Energy Informa-
tion Administration. This means
that to make our nation's electricity
production emission-free, the price
of electricity for all Americans will
have to go up. The price the non-
partisan Congressional Budget
Office estimates the climate change
bill will incur on each household is
an extra $127 per year.
Republicans callthis figure anew
$22 billion tax. But most taxes are
paid only when money is exchanged.
For example, income taxes are col-
lected only when an individual
makes an income. Sales taxes are
paid only on non-food sales. But the
new "tax" imposed by the climate
change bill will be paid by everyone
who uses electricity. And, unfortu-
nately, it will be distributed among
the rich and poor alike.
According to the Press Office
of the Social Security Administra-

tion, there are 51 million Ameri-
cans receiving social security
benefits, many of whom live on a
fixed income. Another 37.3 million
live below the poverty level, accord-
ingtothe U.S. Census Bureau. These
people - along with everyone else
- have to pay electric bills to keep
their food fresh in their refrigerator,
their stove or microwave cooking
and their furnace and air condition-
ing going. They are facing a huge
increase in their necessary electric-
ity bill with no way to pay for it.
Green energy
is nice, but it's
problematic.
With millions of Americans who
live below the poverty level or on
a fixed income forced to sacrifice
to pay their electric bill when they
have nothing left to sacrifice, many
will be unable to pay all their nec-
essary bills. Where will they make
cuts to pay for their rising electric
bill? Doctors' visits and medica-

tion, while necessary, are an easy
expense to cut. But for those who
desperately need medication, other
payments such as rent or the water
bill may be cut in favor of maintain-
ing electric power. Ultimately, the
rise in electricity costs may force
the impoverished and those on a
fixed income out of their homes or
make them sacrifice their water
supplies or medicines.
These problems look familiar.
They're similar to some of the prob-
lems the climate changebill istrying
to solve - climate change forcing
people out of their homes, reducing
their water supplies and affecting
their health.
The climate change bill will now
movetothe Senateand- ifapproved
- President Barack Obama. The
Senate and Obama may want to take
into consideration the fact that the
bill causes many of the problems
it's trying to fix. Or, like the House,
they may just choose to ignore the
plight of the very Americans they're
responsible for.

TUITION HIKE
From Page 1
sity announced in March that it will
not increase tuition rates for Ohio
residents for the next academic year.
The tuition rate increase, com-
bined with enrollment changes, will
bring in a projected $54 million in
revenue for the University.
Regents Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) and Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms)voted against the tuition
increase, breaking the regents' two-
year streak of unanimous approval
of the budget.
Ilitch said she believes University
students should not be forced to pay
an increase in tuition, especially
with the state's current economic
situation.
"Just like families across Michi-
gan are doing during these tough
times, we need to re-evaluate our
priorities and our budgets," Ilitch
said. "We have to fix our budget cri-
sis from within - not on the backs of
working students and families."

administration could improve the
budget by making more internal
adjustments.
"It is my firm belief that we must
find new revenue sources and new
ways to contain costs, identify addi-
tional cuts that can be made atcevery
level, contain costs by centralizing
more functions to avoid duplicative
efforts and tighten our belts and
make the same difficult sacrifices
made every day by the hardworking
people that attend our fine institu-
tion," Ilitch said.
Sullivan said that in light of
Michigan's economic slump, it was
difficult for her and the Budget
Committee to determine the budget
for the 2010 fiscal year.
"We find ourselves in the middle
ofaverydifficulteconomic time, not
just for the state of Michigan, but
worldwide," Sullivan said. "And so
it has been a very challenging time
for us to put together a budget. The
budget team has worked harder this
year than ever before."
The budget takes into account
an estimated state appropriation
of $316.6 million for next year - a
Mention This AD
And Receive $100 Off. Now is the
perfect time to prep with the
nation's leader in test preparation.

$10.4 million decrease from this
year's amount - and is waiting to
be approved by the House of Repre-
sentatives, Senate and Gov. Jennifer
Granholm.
The University won't know the
exactamount of state appropriations
until the state determines its budget
in October, but the state agreed to
maintain funding for higher educa-
tion at no less than the 2006 level
as a condition for receiving federal
stimulus money.
The 2010 budget represents the
largest investment in financial aid
that the University has ever made.
It includes $118 million in centrally
funded financial aid, which is an
increase for undergraduate finan-
cial aid by 11.7 percent.
"We are reaffirming our com-
mitment to meet the full dem-
onstrated financial need of all
undergraduates who are residents
in the state of Michigan," said Sulli-
van, in response to the financial aid
increase. "That has been our policy
in the past, and that will continue to
be our policy."
Donations from University alum-
ni and other University affiliates
are responsible for the increase in
financial aid funding.
"Many students are going to
see this year fewer loans and more
grant aid because of the increased
resources for financial aid and
because of more generous Pell
Grants from the federal government
and also because of more money
for work study," Sullivan said. "We
believe that more students will take
home actual cash and will need to
take out fewer loans.
"In addition we estimate that
22,000 University of Michigan fam-
ilies will benefit from the American
Opportunity Tax Credit."
The AOTC is a tax credit con-
tained in the stimulus package
available for families with one earn-
er making $80,000 or less or two
earners making $160,000 or less.
Sullivan said that the Budget Com-

mittee will begin preparing for the
budgets of fiscal years 2011 and 2012
because it is concerned that state
appropriations could be even lower.
"We have been engaged in long
term planning looking out at the
financial situation in Michigan for
the future as well," Sullivan said.
"And because of that, we are going
to institute a program of prudent
cost cutting to prepare us for fiscal
year '11 and fiscal year'12."
The program of prudent cost-
cutting has already been instated
for next year's budget, including $15
million in cuts, which will be taken
from every unit that receives Gen-
eral Fund money. The General Fund
represents 28 percent of the overall
budget and is composed of tuition
and fees, state appropriations and
indirect cost recovery on sponsored
research activity.
Some cost-saving measures have
already been enacted, some are cur-
rently in the process and some will
be done in the future, Sullivan said.
In the past six years, the Budget
Committee has saved and reallo-
cated $135 million from the General
Fund budget by monitoring the
University's purchasing and energy
conservation, containing health
care costs, using technology to
reduce administrative costs and by
shifting some expenses from the
General Fund to other funds.
But Sullivan said this year many
more of these cuts are goingto come
out of academic units instead of
operational units.
She added that the cuts will
not damage the University's aca-
demic programs, which are among
the most important aspects of the
undergraduate experience.
"We're going to (make cuts)
without doing damage to the aca-
demic programs because the aca-
demic programs are what are most
important to our students, and we
want to maintain an undergraduate
experience that is second to none,"
Sullivan said. "We have a terrific

undergraduate experience here, and
I'm optimistic that we'll continue to
be able to do that."
As another cost-cutting mea-
sure, University President Mary Sue
Coleman, Sullivan, University deans
and all executive officers declined a
merit salary increase for the coming
fiscal year.
"We wanted to show leadership,"
Coleman said. "We have in our
budget a modest increase for fac-
ulty and staff, but we make a lot of
money, and we wanted people to see
that we're not going to have a salary
increase."
University faculty will see an
average 2.5-percent salary increase
while University staff will see an
average 2-percent salary increase.
Coleman said this year's budget
was constructed on the premise
that the University would "emerge
as a stronger institution."
But she said financial difficulties
are not over.
"We are not out of the woods,"
Coleman said. "We anticipate more
budget challengesinthenear future,
but we are confident in the institu-
tion's ability to move forward."

'American Teenager'
woefully unconvincing

"The Secret Teenger
Life of the
American Mondays
Teenager" - at 8 p.m.
an ABC Family ABC Family
drama detail-
ing the life of a
pregnant 10th-grader who strug-
gles to balance the mundane rig-
ors of high school with the recent
birth of her first child - has the
potential to paint a picture of
the life of real adolescents all
over the country. But it fails: The
show's wholly artificial nature
creates something impossible to
identify with.
After an infuriatingly long
series of flashbacks from the sec-
ond season of the show, season
three opens with a conversation
between focal point Amy Juer-
gens (newcomer Shailene Wood-
ley) and her mother Anne (Molly
Ringwald, "Pretty in Pink") in
which Amy complains that her
mother isn't doing enough to
help care for Amy's newborn
son John. Amy's immaturity is
one of the show's biggest flaws.
It's difficult to believe that even
the most self-centered teenager
could be so unaffected by moth-
erhood. Her constant sense of
entitlement puts the show in the
uncomfortable position of hav-
ing an innately unlikeable pro-
tagonist.
Almost every character on the
show is solely one-dimension-
al. Grace, a religious teenager,
makes reference to her faith in
almost every scene. Wooden per-
formances from the supporting
actors, especially Amy's younger
sister Ashley (newcomer India
Eisley), add to the show's over-
whelming sense of falsity. Amy's
father George ( Mark Derwins,
"24") delivers his lines in a gruff
monotone that makes him appear
absurdly angry no matter what is

occurring onscreen.
Show creator Brenda Hamp-
ton seems to have modeled
"Secret Life" after her previous
program "7th Heaven," and the
characters on both shows share
wildly dysfunctional views
on love and relationships and
an overriding obsession with
Jesus. Literally all of Amy's
friends - from Christian zealot
Grace to sheltered Ben (new-
comer Ken Baumann) - are
constantly preoccupied with
losing their virginity. Even the
lives of the show's adult char-
acters revolve around romantic
conquests and manipulating
other people's relationships.
This overriding focus contra-
dicts the show's pro-abstinence
theme and seems an odd choice
when the mistakes that lead to
Amy Juergen's pregnancy are
bemoaned constantly.
Unintentionally
the funniest
show on TV.
Plot twist after ridiculous plot
twist is handled with the utmost
sincerity. For instance, see the
scene in which Grace's mother
and brother walk into the house
crying after receiving the news
that her husband has died in a
plane crash, only to be met by
a glowing Grace and boyfriend
informingthem that the pair just
had sex for the first time. Scenes
like this would make the viewer
think the show was supposed to
be a parody of an overly intense
teen drama if they weren't so
deathly serious.
While the word "good" would
not come to mind when describ-
ing "Secret Life," it's nothing if
not entertaining. Viewers have
to marvel at the sheer ingenuity
of the writingteam in stretching
a single pregnancy across three
seasons and the totally implau-
sible storylines that somehow
manage to reach new levels
of implausibility every week.
"Secret Life" might uninten-
tionally be the funniest show on
television.

On Apr. 3, Palushaj came one
step closer to proving Simon right.
Palushaj signed a contract with
the Peoria Rivermen, the Ameri-
can Hockey League affiliate of the
NHL's St. Louis Blues.
Palushaj sat down with Michigan
coach Red Berenson prior to mak-
ing a final decision - one that would
mean forfeiting his final two years
of NCAA eligibility.
Berenson has historically been
opposed to players leaving the Uni-
versity early if they are not ready for
the next level. But Palushaj said the
two are still on "good terms," even
after his premature departure from
the maize and blue.
"He was disappointed, but you
don't just leave to play in Peoria,"
Palushaj said. "It's a chance to play
in the NHL and play for St. Louis. He
understands where my heart's at."

A SELF-MADE FAMILY
For the past few weeks, Palushaj
has been stationed in St. Louis,
training with the Blues' strength
and conditioning coaches to
become stronger and improve his
skating. But Palushaj wouldn't real-
ly consider that work - especially
with an opportunity to impress the
St. Louis coaching staff at the Pro-
Orientation Camp which begins on
July 8.
Working 30 to 40 hours a week as
a 12 year-old - that's real work. Just
tell that to Tom Palushaj, Aaron's
father.
In 1972, the elder Palushaj emi-
grated from his native country of
Albania to the United States. Aar-
on's mother, Rita, had traveled to
the United States just three years
earlier.
As a teenager, Tom endured long

hours to support his family of 11. He
and his brothers eventually became
entrepreneurs in the restaurant
industry, opening Archie's in Livo-
nia and the Lyon Grill in South
Lyon.
"They're a self-made family, and
it's agoodhome,"Simonsaid."Aaron
probably grew up with inspiration
around him all the time."

From Page 11
and a coach's best weapon. It's what
every coach, at any level, looks for.
And it didn't take long for Simon
to recognize the offensive talent he
had on his bench.
"(Aaron) was just a punk when he
showed up (in Des Moines)," Simon
said. "He was a real young kid, fresh
out of Midget Minor in the Honey-
baked (AAA) system. He was under-
developed physically but most kids
are at that age, but you knew he had
the body to grow. ... The determin-
ing factor of having him on that team
was thathe just always scored goals.
"Even as the second-youngest
player in our camp (in 2005), he still
scored."
As a rookie, Palushaj had to prove
to Simon and the rest of the Bucca-
neer coaching staff that he belonged
in the lineup. Whether it was in off-
ice workouts, practices or the weight
room, he needed to show thathe was
driven and committed in his new
environment. And he did.
But his second year in the United
States Hockey League was a differ-
ent story.
"He definitely played more of a
leadership role," Simon said. "Aaron
also had a little bit of pressure on him
to perform well because he was a
highly recruited player at Michigan."
The more experienced Palushaj
played on the first and second line
for the whole season while register-
ing 67 points and finishing second in
scoring. The same kid who used to
pour endless buckets of pucks onto
the ice had solidified himself as one
of the top Wolverine recruits for
2007.
HOCKEYIQ
Size is a luxury in hockey.
And for Palushaj, his5 foot, 11 inch,
175-pound frame makes him an aver-
age-sized player. It's clear Palushaj's
not goingto be one ofthe biggestskat-
ers on any team he plays on.
But being big is not really one of
the components that characterizes
an exceptional hockey player.

Without a size advantage, he has
developed an intangible ability that
can't often be taught and few players
truly posses: outstanding hockey IQ.
And while Palushaj's hockey IQ is
superior to many players, it'll need
to develop even further according to
Peoria coach Davis Payne.
"The developmental timeline for
him is very steep," Payne said. "Play-
ing inthe AHL against guys who have
been playing pro or who have played
in the NHL is a definite step up. His
competition will be tougher which
will force his level of play to come
up and with that, the developmental
curve willbe forced to steepen."
PALUSHAJ IN PEORIA
This upcoming season will be
Palushaj's first full year with the
Rivermen, and while he is looking
to cement a permanent place in the
lineup, he will also hope to revert
back to his old ways: simply putting
the puck in the back of the net.
Still, it wasn't as if Palushaj didn't
score at Michigan. He had 23 goals
in his 82 games in Ann Arbor. But he
was just more of a shoot first, pass
second kind of player.
"I'm a goal scorer," Palushaj said.
"But my first year at school - the
first powerplay unit was me, (Max)
Pacioretty, (Chad) Langlais, (Kevin)
Porter and (Chad) Kolarik. Play-
ing with those guys, you're really
intimidated - going into college as
a 17-year old and you're playing with
guys that put up 55 points in a season
in NCAA."
Payne mentioned that he would
like Palushaj to drive to the inside of
the ice more and play to his offensive
strengths. Whether that includes
passing the puck to an open team-
mate in the slot, rifling a snap shot
from 20 feet out or sliding the puck
back door on the powerplay, Payne
wants offense and plenty of it.
"There's something that goes on
inside their brain that says, 'Hey,
I need to make a difference when
I've got the puck,"' Payne said. "We
want guys thinking that they need to
score, they want to score, they love to
score. We want Aaron to continue to
be one of those guys."
