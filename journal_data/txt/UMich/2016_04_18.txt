panic attacks. I 
stopped eating. I 
was really, really, 
really sick, and I 
ended up leaving 

school.”

“That anxiety was 
what was leading 
me to not want to

throughout my

including myself.”

especially because 
everyone around me 
seemed as though 
they were having a

It was LSA sophomore Lauren Matson’s first night on campus 

freshman year when she felt it.

“I was walking back with my friend that night through the streets of 

Ann Arbor, and I just felt this pang of loneliness — this pang of sadness,” 
Matson said.

It must be homesickness, she thought. Sure, she missed her friends 

from home, but didn’t everyone, especially on their first night?

The sadness, however, stayed. Matson began having difficulty eating 

and keeping food down. Some days, she would only eat a granola bar 
or two because of nausea. Within weeks, her bodily sickness began to 
negatively impact other aspects of her life too. Worried she would feel 
sudden bouts of queasiness, she didn’t want to leave her dorm and felt 
anxious about going out with new friends.

“That anxiety was what was leading me to not want to leave my dorm, 

or go out with my friends to do things in Ann Arbor Welcome Week,” she 
said.

Transitioning to college
Matson’s experience is one that has familiar echoes for a lot of 

University students — last year 4,197 students sought help from CAPS — 
and for college students nationwide, with a range of different outcomes, 
choices and paths for each as they move forward in their college careers 
and lives.

For Matson, the choice was to go to Counseling and Psychological 

Services three weeks later, on the advice of a friend. It wasn’t until 
November, however, when she would find answers.

She spent months bouncing back and forth between CAPS and 

University Health Service. A CAPS counselor referred her to UHS, 
determining the medical staff would be more suited to address her 
stomach problems. The lines between physical illness and mental illness 
blurred.

Matson was put on medication to correct the nausea, but the 

medication soon stopped working. As time went on, she began to have 
suicidal thoughts — she said she always knew the problem was with her 
mind, not her stomach.

When she returned to UHS with the same symptoms of nausea, she 

was told she had depressive disorder. She was back to seeing counselors 
at CAPS, and her parents started visiting every week — or she would go 
home every weekend. But nothing was working.

CAPS currently does not have the resources to support long-term 

care, and eventually, Matson said, her counselor felt it was time to refer 
her to an outside counselor, who would become essential to her health 
improvement in the coming years.

Students seeking mental health help can also go to the University 

Health Service, but according to Dr. Robert Winfield, chief health officer 
and director of UHS, the psychiatry department only offers prescription 
and drug treatments.

“We don’t offer any counseling at Health Services, so there are a variety 

of situations where somebody wants to be evaluated for the continuation 
of medications,” he said. “And some of those situations are situations 
where somebody might choose to not get counseling or may want to focus 
on medications.”

There is no one cure-all for patients concerned about their mental 

health, though many people choose to turn to medications over counseling 
after talking with a doctor. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 
across the United States approximately one in 10 Americans ages 12 or 
older take antidepressants. At colleges, these numbers are typically 
higher.

“Sometimes people just feel terrible with anxiety or depression but 

they haven’t been able to put a word on it — they just don’t feel well,” 
Winfield said. “And so they may think ‘Maybe there’s something wrong 
with me physically,’ so they may come in not knowing what’s wrong.”

LSA junior Raivynn Smith had a similar experience with a physical 

sickness accompanying mental health concerns. Before transferring to 
the University this year, Smith took a two-year gap following a painful and 
difficult freshman year experience at a small private college in Illinois. 

She said though it probably wasn’t when she first started experiencing her 
social and generalized anxiety, coming to college is when she first noticed 
it. Like Matson, the transition to college was difficult and her anxiety 
began to affect her diet.

“I had really bad panic attacks,” Smith said. “I stopped eating. I was 

really, really, really sick, and I ended up leaving school.”

The gap was cathartic for her, she said, though she noted that she still 

deals with her anxiety, especially on a larger campus like the University 
of Michigan where day-to-day things like going to the dining hall can be 
challenging.

Even for students who have already noticed and begun acting on the 

signs of mental health issues before college, the transition can still be 
significantly difficult, on top of what is an already challenging process. 
LSA sophomore Jarrett Reichel dealt with depression throughout high 
school, but had a support system then — leaving home, he said, meant 
leaving that comfort and support.

“I had a really good support group in high school, with my friends 

and my family, and coming here since none of my friends came here, 
the transition was really difficult because I didn’t have that support 
group I normally had,” Reichel said. “Then, of course, the added stress of 
changing your entire life.”

Reichel lived in Bursley Residence Hall his freshman year and said he 

found the experience to be isolating. Like many students, he didn’t make 
friends immediately during Welcome Week and felt alone. Everyone in 
his hall became tight-knit and he said he felt as though he was missing out 
on the college experience.

“It was a pretty rough transition — especially because everyone around 

me seemed as though they were having a good time, and it was kind of 
hard to recover from that,” Reichel said. “It was irrational, but I felt like 
after the first couple of months it was almost too late (to make friends). So, 
that was rough, especially in regard to the future.”

Like Reichel, LSA junior Morgan Rondenelli said she found the new 

surroundings in college made it easier for her to avoid addressing her 
obsessive compulsive disorder.

‘Beyond America’ 

event marks Wallace 

House head’s 
retirement 

By EMMA KERR

Managing News Editor

Several 
of 
the 
nation’s 
top 

names in journalism came to the 
University of Michigan Friday to 
discuss how foreign journalism has 
evolved in recent years and why it 
has significance in today’s media 
landscape.

The event was held to mark the 

retirement of Charles Eisendrath, 
who announced in October he 
would step down as director of 
University’s Knight-Wallace house 
after 30 years. The Knight-Wallace 
House aims to promote journalism 

in several ways, including hosting 
mid-career journalists as fellows on 
campus each year. Eisendrath will 
be replaced by Lynette Clemetson, 
current senior director of strategy 
and content initiatives at National 
Public Radio.

In making the case for the 

importance of foreign news, all 
three panelists — CNN’s Christiane 
Amanpour, Dean Baquet, executive 
editor of the New York Times, and 
founder of Politico John Harris— 
and 
moderator 
David 
Greene, 

co-host of NPR’s Morning Edition, 
advocated for impactful, thoughtful 
and unrelenting foreign coverage, 
despite the many risks that kind of 
coverage can entail.

Greene 
began 
the 
night 
by 

speaking on the challenges he faced 
covering the Gaddafi government 
amid violence in Libya, saying that 
foreign reporting is essential not 
despite these conditions, but because 

of them. He pointed in particular 
to a situation in which he covered 
an alleged funeral for victims of 
airstrikes in Libya, though he 
suspected the event was orchestrated 
by government officials.

“We were in an oppressive 

reporting environment where we 
were being fed propaganda, we felt 
we could not report on the truth 
and it was really an uncomfortable 
environment 
for 
journalists 
to 

being in.” he said. “The Gaddafi
 

government wouldn’t answer and 
questions about where the airstrikes 
were or how this happened, it almost 
seemed like there was a show. There 
were people firing guns in the air on 
the shores of the Mediterranean but 
where those bullets were going, I 
had no idea — though I’m glad they 
weren’t falling on any of us. ”

In conjunction with the physical 

risks and factual challenges of 
reporting on foreign news, panelists 

also 
highlighted 
another, 
more 

logistical 
concern 
— 
resource 

allocation between foreign and 
domestic coverage. Baquet said 
before the September 11 attacks, 
foreign news was seen by many 
publications as not worth the fiscal 
risks, but this mentality has been 
changing in recent years.

“If you take your eye off the 

ball of covering the world, you 
miss gigantic stories and you miss 
transformational 
moments,” 
he 

said. “It’s our highest mission, 
especially for the news organization 
that are fortunate enough to have 
the resources to cover the world — 
and there are fewer of those — and 
finally, I think that the dirty secret 
is that people always wanted foreign 
news.”

Citing the recent launch of Politico 

Europe, Harris said in recent years, 
foreign coverage has highlighted a

Decision comes 

after year of 
faculty, staff 
discussion 

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

In the fall of 2016, a new tool will 

be available for students choosing 
their courses and professors. 
Based on guidance from the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs and Central 
Student Government, University 
Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 
has 

approved the release of course 

evaluations for the upcoming fall 
semester.

The 
release 
of 
course 

evaluations has been a heavily 
debated topic at SACUA, Senate 
Assembly — the full faculty 
governing body — and CSG over 
the last academic year.

In an interview, Pollack said 

the initiative was largely student-
driven.

“It was the students who 

really pushed to have it released,” 
Pollack said. “We asked student 
and 
faculty 
committees 

representing student government 
and faculty government to get 
together. They came up with what 
I thought were very thoughtful 
recommendations and a set of 

questions that are particularly 
tailored to student needs, and 
we’re gonna release it.”

Several 
policies 
will 

accompany the release, upon 
recommendation of two faculty 
and student committees. Only 
students with University e-mail 
accounts will be able to access and 
use the student evaluations, per 
committee request.

Several of the recommended 

policies also outline circumstances 
under which evaluations would 
not be released. Evaluations will 
only be released if one of two 
thresholds is met: A 50 percent 
participation rate or a minimum 
total of 30 evaluations per class. In

More than 480 
condemn Diag 

messages, applaud 
campus response

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Thursday, a letter condemning 

the anti-Islamic chalkings on 
the Diag and applauding the 
University’s response to it was 
sent to University President 
Mark 
Schlissel, 
University 

Provost Martha Pollack and 
LSA Dean Andrew Martin.

The letter received signatures 

from 
480 
faculty 
members 

within two days of it being 
written by professors in the 
American Culture department.

One 
of 
the 
collaborators 

on the letter, Prof. Evelyn 
Alsultany, Director of the Arab 

and Muslim American Studies 
Program, said the letter quickly 
gained traction.

“The letter was first sent to 

History department, and then 
it was sent to the American 
Culture department, and then 
professors kept sending it along 
to different friends and their 
other 
colleagues.” 
Alsultany 

said. “Within 48 hours there 
were nearly 500 signatures.”

Faculty 
from 
both 

undergraduate and graduate units, 
including LSA, Medical School, 
Law School, Engineering, Art & 
Design and Public Policy, all signed 
the letter in a display of solidarity 
with Muslim students. 

The 
letter 
emphasizes 

the faculty’s support for the 
response to the chalkings a week 
ago, and explicitly opposes the 
nature of the messages written 
on the Diag.

“We stand with our friends/

students/colleagues and with 

the Central Student Government 
(CSG), 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
(SACUA), and Senate Assembly 
in condemning the recent anti-
Muslim, 
anti-immigrant, 
and 

anti-activist chalkings on the 
Diag,” the letter read.“Whatever 
the 
political 
motivations 
of 

those engaged in such acts, their 
expressions of disrespect for 
members of our community can 
have nothing but a chilling effect 
on the social and intellectual life 
of this campus.”

The letter also emphasizes a 

need for community activism to 
oppose Islamophobia on campus.

“We call on all members of the 

community — students, faculty, 
staff, and administrators — to 
join in support of the right of 
everyone, as the CSG put it, ‘to 
be free from discrimination, 
persecution, and to be treated 
with dignity and respect by 
the University and the campus 
community,” the letter states.

President Schlissel responded 

to the faculty letter Friday 
in an e-mail to all faculty 
signatories that stressed the 
University’s commitment to the 
Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern 
and North African students 
and 
underscored 
how 
the 

administration has shown that 
committment.

“We have also worked to 

communicate 
our 
values 
of 

respect, civility and equality.” 
Schlissel’s response said. “The 
President’s speech at winter 
2015 commencement addressed 
the challenging balance between 
constitutional rights and a sense 
of safety, specifically referencing 
Islamophobia. 
Remarks 
at 

the U-M Martin Luther King 
Jr. 
Symposium 
in 
January 

discussed 
the 
hostility 
and 

hateful messages the students 
had experienced in the context 
of our work to do better as a 
University.”

Several Central 

Student Government 
amendments rejected

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
of 
Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel approved 
seven 
amendments 
to 
the 

Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities Monday aimed 
at addressing awareness about 
the statement and transparency 
related to the amendment process.

The 
statement, 
originally 

created 
in 
1996, 
details 

expectations for student conduct 
and outlines suggested sanctions 
and disciplinary measures for 
violations. 
The 
amendment 

process occurs every three years 
and is coordinated by the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution.

This 
cycle’s 
amendments 

include 
increasing 
education 

and awareness among students 

about the statement, clarifying 
and 
increasing 
transparency 

related to the amendment process, 
addressing stalking and intimate 
partner violence and clarifying 
the 
scope 
of 
violations. 
An 

additional amendment will alter 
the amendment process so it must 
be completed by the end of winter 
semester.

Students were able to propose 

changes to the statement from 
April 2015 until the beginning of 
November for the consideration 
of the Student Relations Advisory 
Committee, the Office of the 
Vice President, General Counsel, 
the Civil Liberties Board and 
eventually Schlissel.

Central Student Government 

has been heavily involved in the 
process, discussing it since their 
first meeting and submitting 
seven amendments of their own.

CSG 
submitted 
two 

amendments 
that 
Schlissel 

rejected, aimed at implementing 
an honor code for students, adding 
provisions to address falsified 

information and changing the 
amendment process to increase 
student voice by allowing CSG to 
participate in the approval process 
for amendments.

Schlissel 
encouraged 
CSG 

to 
continue 
to 
develop 
the 

amendments that were not passed 
as they could be considered 
in 
future 
amendment 
years, 

according to a press release.

In a November meeting, CSG 

General Counsel Jacob Pearlman, 
a Public Policy junior, said adding 
CSG to the approval process 
would ensure students have a say 
in all amendments proposed to the 
process.

“Skipping student input here, 

I don’t like that,” Pearlman said. 
“An executive officer or the 
Faculty Senate could propose 
amendments to SRAC that CSG 
would never see … Giving CSG 
the power to recommend or not 
recommend all proposals and not 
simply their own.”

addition, no evaluations for faculty 
during their first three years at 
the University will be released. 
Finally, if there are unforeseen and 
significant circumstances, faculty 
are able to opt out of releasing the 
data for that semester.

In 2014, the average response 

rate for course evaluation data 
was marked at slightly above 50 
percent.

Courses 
for 
which 
the 

evaluations are not released will 
be marked with a code that will 
inform students why the data 
was not released. SACUA chair 
Silke-Marie Weineck, professor of 
comparative literature, said this 
will help flag faculty that are opting 
out time after time again.

“If there was a faculty member 

that abused the opt-out option — 
which I don’t think they will — it 
would show up pretty quickly 
because there would be opt-out 
after opt-out,” Weineck said. “I 
have no worries about that; I just 
want to protect faculty, because 
every once in a while, someone can 
have such a brutal semester and it 
wouldn’t be fair or representative.”

Angela 
Dillard, 
professor 

of 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies and associate dean for 
Undergraduate Studies in LSA, 
wrote in an e-mail interview that 
the release of evaluations is a way 
for students to learn more about 
the courses they are taking.

“Giving students access to more 

information about courses is a 
benefit,” Dillard wrote. “It could 
also begin to make students more 
accountable for both the quantity 
and quality of feedback they supply. 
We need to address this dimension 
of student evaluations and begin to 
shift the culture around them.”

The process of releasing the 

evaluations 
has 
spanned 
the 

course of this academic year. After 
University administrators came to 
SACUA with a proposal to release 
course evaluations in Fall 2015, the 
Faculty Senate voted in October 
2015 to postpone the release of 
evaluations, opening debate on 
the issue up until the committees 
reached 
decisions 
earlier 
this 

semester.

Ultimately, the two committees 

were formed to balance out 
student 
concerns 
— 
Central 

Student 
Government 
leaders 

pushed heavily for release of the 
evaluations — and faculty ones.

In a November 2015 op-ed, CSG 

President Cooper Charlton and his 
administration stated their goals of 
having evaluations ready for Fall 
2016, saying “course evaluations 
were established for students, by 
students”.

LSA junior Anushka Sarkar, 

former CSG chief programming 
officer, served on both committees 
and said she was proud to have 
been part of the process.

“I am very proud of Cooper 

Charlton’s 
administration 
for 

pushing this out,” Sarkar said. 
“They had promised the student 
body at the beginning of their 
term that they would get this 
information available to students 
because they believed this would be 
incredibly important for students 
to have this data.”

Sarkar said alternatives students 

are using, such as Rate My 
Professors, aren’t allowing students 
to make informed decisions about 
their courses. She added that she 
has relied on alternative, biased 
information in the past to make 
choices about classes.

“Students are going to be very 

pleased to have this information 
available,” 
she 
said. 
“Now 

that students have access to a 
standardized and educated data 
set, they will be able to make 
more informed decisions about 
their courses and that’s really 
important.”

Engineering prof. Bill Schultz, 

vice chair of SACUA, said the 
postponement of the release until 
now allowed faculty and students 
to make the process more attentive 
to community needs.

“We wanted to do this in a 

thoughtful way,” Schultz said. 
“If this was going to be officially 
released, we wanted to have the 
instrument to change it, to make 
it less of a popularity contest and 
more of a thoughtful process that 
talks about learning outcomes 
students might see in the course.”

unique circumstance in which 
editorial 
and 
the 
business 

opportunities collide.

“Our audience, advertisers and 

subscribers reflect this reality: 
the world is a lot closer now. They 
are saying, ‘if you do something 
in Europe, count us interested,’” 
Harris said. “We are doing this 
because it’s interesting, but we’re 
also doing this because we think 
it’s a robust business opportunity. 
I think that’s pretty exciting 
when you can combine attractive 
editorial targets with a business 
model that can be sustained.”

Panelists also touched on how 

modern audiences can be reached 
in a world of social media and 
unlimited information sources 
online. Baquet said despite the 
shifts in accessibility, journalists 
should listen to their audiences, 
who he said have demonstrated 
they want serious and compelling 
stories — both domestic and 
abroad.

“If 
people 
look 
at 
their 

audience, people want serious 
stuff,” Baquet said. “No one’s 
coming to the New York Times in 
droves because of our coverage 
of Britney Spears.”

Amanpour noted that though 

foreign news often offers a 
platform 
for 
an 
audience’s 

desires and journalist’s interests 
to overlap, the craft of a journalist 
should also be focused on more 
than pleasing the audience.

“The 
whole 
point 
of 

information is to tell you about 
what you don’t know you don’t 
know,” she said.

Harris echoed Amanpour’s 

sentiment, 
saying 
journalism 

should emphasize “feeding them 
their spinach” in a compelling 
way.

“I think journalism has an 

obligation to be interesting,” 
Harris said. “The world is 
interesting, we should be 
interesting. 
The 
human 

dimensions 
of 
a 
story 
are 

important and I don’t believe 
in making an audience do 
something 
dutifully, 
it’s 
a 

challenge to your journalism 
storytelling abilities to make a 
story interesting.”

He added that distinctions 

between old and new journalism 
are outdated, saying just as the 
field of journalism as a whole 
evolves, so should the way 
foreign news is approached and 
discussed.

The Michigan Daily, former 
CSG President Cooper Charlton 
said the amendment would have 
allowed CSG to review proposed 
amendments concurrently with 
SRAC.

“This doesn’t eliminate any 

power from anyone. It just 
allows students to be more 
involved in the process,” he said. 
“And they shot it down. We were 
very disappointed in this. The 
CSG team is very disappointed 
with SRAC this year. We believe 
they are very out of touch with 
students.”

Speaking to the honor code, 

Charlton said the proposal did 
not pass due to its alteration 
by the SRAC and their refusal 
to work collaboratively with 
students.

“SRAC was an extremely 

intelligent 
and 
wise 
body; 

however, they were extremely 
out of touch with the students,” 
he said.

LILLIAN GAINES | OP-ED

Dear Colleagues:

Thank you for writing to share your 

condemnation of the repugnant chalkings on the 
Diag. These messages are hurtful to members 
of the University of Michigan community, 
inconsistent with the values to which we aspire 
and antithetical to the intellectual life of our 
campus.

We agree that all Arab, Muslim and MENA 

(Middle Eastern and North African) students, 
faculty, staff and visitors should feel welcome 
and have an equal opportunity to thrive at the 
University. Their presence makes our campus 
better in every way.

University leadership has had frequent, 

ongoing discussions with Arab, Muslim and 
MENA students about the campus climate for 
several months. This includes a Jan. 11 meeting 
at the president’s house with students from 
these groups and the Jan. 25 “Sharing Stories, 
Building Allyhood: Student Voices Against 
Islamophobia” event on campus.

Leaders from Student Life and the College of 

Literature, Science and the Arts have worked 
closely with the Islamophobia Working Group, 
including incorporating the group’s feedback into 
the college’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan. E. Royster Harper, vice president for 
student life and Dean of Students Laura Blake 
Jones met with student leaders Wednesday. 
Senior 
University 
leaders, 
including 
the 

president, participated alongside students 
representing racial, ethnic, religious and 
LGBTQ groups in a listening session Wednesday 
organized by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

We have also worked to communicate our values 

of respect, civility and equality. The president’s 

speech at Winter 2015 commencement addressed 
the challenging balance between constitutional 
rights and a sense of safety, specifically referencing 
Islamophobia. Remarks at the University’s Martin 
Luther King Jr. Symposium in January discussed 
the hostility and hateful messages the students 
had experienced in the context of our work to do 
better as a university.

After learning of the offensive chalk messages, 

the University reaffirmed our values in our initial 
statement. This was followed by a March 31 post on 
the president’s website titled “We Stand Together 
Against Hate,” which was linked to his Twitter 
account. On April 7, the president published an 
essay on The Huffington Post discussing the 
degrading of our discourse through disrespect, 
hate, bigotry and targeted attacks.

Last Friday, former CSG President Cooper 

Charlton and President Schlissel sent an e-mail 
to all students on our Ann Arbor campus calling 
the messages “repugnant and hurtful to members 
of our community.” Correspondence with the 
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee’s 
Michigan Regional Office resulted in a message of 
support earlier this week.

We have been very impressed by the members 

of our community who have taken a stance against 
the anti-Islam messages. In addition to you and 
those you mentioned, we have seen students 
reaching out to one another and offering support.

We all agree that racism and discrimination 

have no place at the University of Michigan.

In response to faculty letter

P

ublic policy in the United States has 
propagated social trauma for centuries. 
In Black communities especially, the 

government has betrayed 
its pledge to protect the 
human rights of life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness 
written in the Declaration 
of 
Independence. 
This 

historical record excluded 
Black 
people, 
setting 

precedent for the systemic 
violence that has created 
oppressive 
conditions 
— 

mental, 
social, 
physical, 

economic and legal — still 
reinforced today.

Public trust in the federal government 

has been declining since 1958. According 
to the Center for Michigan’s Community 
Conversation Issue Guide Book, “public trust 
in (Michigan) state government is (also) low, 
and dropping.” Currently, the Center for 
Michigan is conducting a series of Community 
Conversations around the state surveying public 
trust in Michigan’s government. The most 
recent conversation took place in Ann Arbor at 
the Ford School of Public Policy. The attendees 
comprised mainly white men and women over 
the age of 40 and only a few undergraduate 
and graduate students. In all of the survey 
questions asked, the results were consistently 
low: The participants in the room did not trust 
the state’s ability to oversee K-12 education or 
public higher education, the state’s ability to 
protect public health or the environment, or 
the state’s ability to provide services for low-
income residents or foster economic growth 
and representative government. 

It’s a general sentiment that the political 

environment in Michigan is grossly inept to 
meet the needs of all of its public constituents. 
The recent actions, or lack thereof, of the state of 
Michigan reflect the structural violence that has 
put Black people in harm’s way and has injured 
their economic, social, political, collective and 
spiritual wellbeing. The oversight of the Flint 
water crisis, the installment of emergency 
managers in predominately Black cities and 
the bystander approach toward refinancing 
Detroit Public Schools reinforce the idea that 
government institutions don’t view themselves 
accountable to Black people. The state’s passive 
policy approaches to these blatant fractures 
of human rights and political sovereignty are 
appalling and should incite outrage.

In some cases, outrage has occurred. 

Historically, when Black people express their 
discontentment with the government, they are 
silenced with legislation or imprisonment. As 
James Baldwin stated in one of his interviews: 
“It is one thing to demand justice in literature, 
and another thing to face the price that one has 
got to pay for it in life.” The risks Blacks face 
strongly asserting their political rights feel 
too dangerous, as proven in the incarceration 
of Black political prisoners during the 1960s 
to 1980s. Our trauma from political violence 
is so deeply rooted and continuously present 
that it feels as though Black Michiganders have 

become emotionally numb to this structural and 
systematic violence. It has become the status 
quo and part and parcel of our history and lived 
experiences. 

Black people were never allowed to heal 

from the trauma handed down from generation 
to generation and permeating our social 
consciousness. Black people are understandably 
exhausted from navigating spaces not designed 
to include them, fighting against structural 
exclusion, while simultaneously rehabilitating 
their communities from decades of political 
destruction.

Black Americans were never granted a truth 

and reconciliation commission forcing the 
government to acknowledge its past wrongs 
and allowing Blacks a healing space from the 
historical injustices we’ve endured, nor were we 
offered any reparations. Thus, our “recovery” 
from these historical traumas has been a violent 
one — one that perpetuates the systemic violence 
embedded in our social structures and kills 
people slowly by preventing them from meeting 
their basic needs.

How can Blacks be expected to trust a 

government that was never meant to serve us? 
A government that historically never viewed 
us as fully human? The government counted 
Blacks as three-fifths of a person, permitted life-
threatening medical experimentation, implanted 
racial inferiority that has since been internalized 
and physically removed us from our homes 
via incarceration, to name just a few. The 
continuity of systemic violence has wounded 
Black spirits, which has made the challenge to 
reverse the social ills of oppression that much 
more overbearing.

Black citizens cannot become tolerant 

of, or complacent in, the discrimination 
administered by our state government. We 
cannot become numb to the destruction that 
specific policies invoke. Violence is an urgent 
matter to address; it requires immediate 
attention and action to prevent further 
damage. A critical systems thinking approach 
to overhaul the political system is required 
for transformational change. This approach 
encourages restorative accountability in the 
political sphere, an important component to 
restoring public trust.

Dr. Miriam Ticktin wisely remarked, “While 

politics is a set of practices by which order is 
created and maintained; the political refers to the 
disruption of an established order.” The personal 
will always be political, and the trauma Blacks 
face is embedded within political institutions.

Black citizens must realize the fight for our 

political, social and economic rights means, in 
the long term, dismantling political institutional 
frameworks at their core. In the interim, Blacks 
should engage in the community restorative 
spaces afforded to us, such as community 
gardens, meditation spaces and trauma-informed 
community centers. There is a compelling and 
critical need for restorative policy practices that 
acknowledge institutional neglect but ultimately 
provide a pathway for social peace.

Reocurring trauma

MARK SCHLISSEL, MARTHA POLLACK, ANDREW MARTIN | OP-ED

Sororities have been criticized for 

many things in the past few years, 
including 
female 
objectification, 

racist exclusion and classism. Each 
organization’s constitution is unique in 
its approach to addressing these issues. 
What unites them all is a foundational 
promise and contractual pledge to 
promote female empowerment — a 
commitment that is increasingly being 
called into question.

The New York Times recently 

published a front-page story titled 
“When a Feminist Pledges a Sorority,” 
a report on Ivy League sororities 
that is both troubling and, in the end, 
overly optimistic: The author, Jessica 
Bennett, interviews women who feel 
they are making real progress in trying 
to turn what have been historically 
sexist and elitist houses into centers of 
feminist fervor.

As I read the article, I could not 

help wondering if sorority members 
at universities like ours, which are far 
more representative of national Greek 
life culture than the Ivy Leagues, 
feel the same way. In other words, 
do sororities actually empower their 
members, and if not, why?

While sororities can operate in 

social, academic and philanthropic 
spheres, for the most part, the 
primary motivation to “Go Greek” 
is the planned social schedule. 
These events promote ideas that 
plainly run contrary to female 
empowerment. To investigate these 
phenomena, I sat down with sorority 
members, past and present, both in 
and outside our University, so they 
could share their experiences with 
their respective organizations.

A senior at the University of 

Virginia and former member of Alpha 
Phi, Olivia Dillingham said Greek 
social 
regulations 
promote 
male 

dominance and, in turn, actually 
constrain women in the larger system.

“While 
Greek 
life 
supposedly 

promotes a space for women to 
interact, it imposes rules on them 

that aren’t imposed on the men in the 
university, which,” she said, “allow 
men to completely dominate the 
social scene … (giving) women 
reason 
to 
want 
to 
objectify 

themselves in order to get invited to 
parties and fit in socially.”

Not only do fraternities host all 

the parties, but they also provide all 
the alcohol at these events. These 
rules are attributed to the National 
Panhellenic 
Conference’s 
policy, 

which states, “College Panhellenics 
shall not spend Panhellenic funds 
to purchase alcoholic beverages for 
any purpose.” Fraternities, free from 
these restrictions, maintain control 
of all the social capital, with free 
reign to choose party themes such as: 
Workout Bros and Yoga Hos, CEOs 
and Corporate Hos, and King Tuts 
and Egyptian Sluts. Younger members 
consequently feel pressured to dress 
in provocative clothing in order to 
continue having parties with the 
fraternity, fill the social calendar and 
attract new members. This attempt to 
emphasize female desirability invokes 
traditional, patriarchal gender roles.

“The whole idea of having gender-

segregated 
houses 
and 
parties 

with sexist themes … and guys 
having power over who they let 
into their house, it’s pretty sexist in 
its nature,” Ariela Levy, a member 
of Alpha Delta Pi at UC Berkeley, 
said of these regulations governing 
sorority social life.

In October 2015, University of 

Michigan 
Panhellenic 
sought 
to 

create a new partnership program 
between sororities and the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center. LSA sophomore Anna Bauer 
is one of SAPAC’s Peer Educators 
and an active member of Pi Beta Phi. 
Anna recognizes that even within 
this progressive group in the Greek 
community, female empowerment is 
minimal.

“(We) ironically only talk about 

our relationships with fraternity 

men,” she said, “and how basically 
everything that we do, think and act 
is influenced by how they think about 
us.” She consistently highlighted 
that this habit of female students 
viewing themselves through a male 
lens is perpetuated through Greek 
life’s gender norms.

This power dynamic between 

sororities and fraternities is deeply 
rooted in National Greek policies. A 
columnist for The Michigan Daily, 
Alison Schalop, recently published 
an article titled “Expectations and 
Regulations in Greek Life” comparing 
her sorority’s handbook, Alpha Chi 
Omega, with an unnamed fraternity’s 
handbook. She contrasted the laws 
governing guests stating, “No men 
are permitted in the Alpha Chi Omega 
household between the hours of 2 a.m. 
and 7 a.m.” In regard to the fraternity’s 
manual, she states she found “nothing 
related to having guests sleep over.”

This regulation, coupled with 

Nationals’ mandate that women must 
live in the sorority house for one 
year, effectively strips heterosexual 
women of any agency to decide 
where they want to be sexually 
active. In addition, since this rule is 
implemented to avoid instances of 
sexual assault, this regulation also 
invokes heteronormative assumptions 
that only men can be the perpetrators 
of sexual violence, as it does nothing to 
restrict female entry.

“I got in trouble with my sorority 

because I spoke out against some of 
their rules, many of which,” Schalop 
told me, “buy into a double standard of 
the expectations of men and women. 
I was immediately told to take my 
opinion down. My sorority, which 
boasts women empowerment and 
growth, wanted to silence my voice.”

Y

ou know how when you say a 
word so many times it starts to 
lose its meaning? Well appar-

ently that’s called 
semantic 
satia-

tion. 
That 
fact 

has nothing to do 
with this column, 
but 
psychology 

really does have 
terminology 
for 

everything.

Anyway, 
I’ve 

been living in Ann 
Arbor for close 
to 
four 
years 

now, and the oft-
repeated word I’m thinking about is 
“dialogue.”

“We need to have a dialogue,” they 

said when the Boycott, Divest and 
Sanctions movement was dominating 
the campus conversation during spring 
2014 and 2015.

“We need to have a dialogue,” they 

said about mental health on campus.

“We need to have a dialogue,” they 

said about sexual assault on campus.

“We need to have a dialogue,” they 

said about diversity on campus.

And most recently, “We need to have 

a dialogue,” they said in response to the 
Islamophobic chalkings on the Diag.

Dialogue is “an exchange of ideas 

or opinions on a particular issue, espe-
cially a political or religious issue, with 
a view to reaching an amicable agree-
ment or settlement.”

Reaching an agreement or an 

“agree to disagree” situation on 
whatever topic is the ideal result and 
generally leaves people on both sides 
of an issue satisfied, or at least content. 
This probably explains why calls for 
dialogue have become the most pre-
dictable response to anything remote-
ly controversial on campus.

But when you really think about 

it, what does dialogue really mean 
in the context it gets used in on cam-
pus? After four years of working at 
the Daily, I’ve concluded it means so 
much and so little at the same time. 
In some cases, establishing places to 
have a dialogue — real, honest con-
versation — has allowed students to 
safely discuss the issues that matter 
to them and seems to ensure that 
people are actually listening.

Take the topic of sexual assault, for 

example. The University of Michigan 
hosted several roundtable discussions 
about the sexual misconduct policy 

this past fall, which resulted in a much 
more comprehensive policy. It felt like 
people’s views were heard. This, in 
addition to the Speak Outs that the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center has hosted, shows how far 
campus has come in trying to make a 
difference on this issue.

Since I came to campus in 2012, 

mental health has also become a much 
less taboo topic thanks to dialogue. The 
Daily has published countless articles 
about mental health and the need for 
more resources on campus. There have 
been all kinds of events about it on 
campus, too. And perhaps as a result of 
these efforts, though it’s far from per-
fect, Counseling and Psychological 
Services has worked to improve its 
intake time. And University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel recently said 
the University is working on plans to 
establish a new mental health clinic 
on campus. That’s a big deal, and 
it’s happening because students are 
coming out and saying, “Enough is 
enough. We need better.”

In other instances, calls for dia-

logue have been little more than empty 
words. Though the word was tossed 
around, the debate over whether Cen-
tral Student Government should have 
passed a resolution to divest from com-
panies engaged in business in Israel 
was objectively anything but dialogue. 
There were two sides entrenched in 
their beliefs. One side said their piece, 
the other said theirs, and there was no 
attempt to really listen to one another.

And just a couple of weeks ago, 

after the anti-Islam chalking incident, 
Schlissel said this as part of a longer 
statement: “I am convinced that we 
have the ability to come together to 
engage in meaningful dialogue on dif-
ficult topics that is enabled by our deep 
commitment to respect for all.”

“We stand together against hate. 

We must work together toward deeper 
understanding.” Of course, I agree with 
the sentiment. The University is a bas-
tion of intelligent human beings. But 
what exactly does he mean by mean-
ingful dialogue?

The same strategies that may have 

worked to develop a better sexual 
misconduct policy can’t be expected 
to work when talking about race and 
religion. We know we need to combat 
Islamophobia on campus. We know 
people of color are marginalized. But 
if it’s sitting around a table for an hour 
and talking about our experiences that 

he’s proposing with this statement, 
then I’m not convinced progress will be 
made. That won’t help us reach a deep-
er understanding of one another. 

Part of what makes the conversa-

tion about race and religion so differ-
ent than others is that it takes a certain 
degree of courage to think past our pre-
conceived beliefs. There’s a reason why 
we often gravitate toward people like 
ourselves — as much as we may claim 
otherwise, we don’t like our beliefs and 
potential biases being challenged.

Because of this difference, calls for 

dialogue about race and religion must 
be treated differently as well. If the 
University really wants to do some-
thing, then it has to do everything in its 
power to get people from all different 
walks of life — races, religions, ethnici-
ties, socioeconomic statuses, etc. — liv-
ing and working together.

The University needs to work on the 

smallest details, such as who lives with 
whom in the dorms. It needs to think 
about the homogeneity in Greek life and 
its implications. It needs to think about 
who studies where in each library and 
who lives where off campus. It needs 
to think about why “safe spaces” need 
to be created in the first place. It needs 
to keep finding ways to make coming to 
this school more affordable and make it 
appealing to people of all backgrounds. 
Only with an understanding of all these 
things — how students live their lives 
— can the University make an earnest 
effort to change the status quo.

Dialogue has the potential to mean 

something all the time. I am so con-
vinced that students aren’t that dif-
ferent from one another, but we (me 
included) and the University don’t do 
enough to put ourselves in the position 
to recognize that. Hosting and attend-
ing events like “Muffins with Mus-
lims,” which happened last Friday, is 
only the beginning of what has to hap-
pen to bring ourselves together in ways 
beyond short conversations and writ-
ing articles of solidarity.

So now this is the end of my final 

column, and I guess all I’m trying to say 
in this article and all the previous ones 
I’ve written is for some reason, I believe 
in the human spirit. I know we can see 
the humanity in each other.

We just have to try harder and turn 

our words into action.

D

ear Gillian,

I’ve been seeing this 

boy for around a month 

now, and I find myself falling for 
him hard. He’s super smart and 
charming and handsome and kind 
of perfect. The one problem is, we 
are both seniors and will be going 
our separate ways in a few weeks. 
I’m trying not to confront this 
fact but it is 
unavoidable. 
I feel like I’ve 
really formed 
a deep bond 
with this 
person and 
want to spend 
as much time 
with him as 
possible, yet 
every time 
we hang out, 
in the back of my mind I hear a 
voice telling me to not pour so much 
into the relationship because it’s 
coming to an end shortly, whether 
or not I like it. Do I just end it now 
in order to make our good-bye that 
much easier? Or do I say screw it 
and keep up the intense level we’ve 
reached now? I would never want to 
stunt my natural inclination, which 
would be to continue on with him, 
but I can’t help but feel scared that 
it’s all for naught once graduation 
happens. I want nothing more than 
to just be in the moment with him, 
but it’s really hard. Help me out!!

— Reluctant Graduate
Dear Reluctant,
Whether it’s the end of summer, 

the end of a program or the end 
of an adventure, many are the 
looming last stops on a life path 
that have been ignored by love. 
But the advice to fellow travelers 
in love is always the same, 
quintessentially expressed in the 
Victorian poet Tennyson’s timeless 
trope: “tis better to have loved and 

lost than never to have loved at all.”

If you were hoping for the 

opposite advice, you’ve come the 
wrong place. The history books, 
poetry volumes, fiction shelves, 
gallery walls and Netflix queues 
all brim with characters carrying 
on with loves that everyone knew 
were doomed. Good luck finding 
any whose pragmatism wasn’t 
pummeled into submission by 
love’s mighty forces.

Do you think “Casablanca” ’s 

Rick and Ilsa, who were from 
opposite ends of the Western 
world, knew zero about each other 
and were facing the Germans 
rolling into Paris, didn’t know they 
were doomed? Nonetheless they 
carried out a storybook romance 
montaged in dreamy flashback. 
They loved, they lost, but they’ll 
always have Paris.

It was the same for Dido, queen 

of Carthage and Aeneas, who 
commanded the Roman fleet soon 
to sail home. You can’t stop divine 
fate; you can’t stop human passion. 
The “Before Sunrise” trilogy is 
conceived entirely around short 
timeframes where the lives of two 
individuals intersect and then 
separate. While the spontaneity of 
Ethan Hawke’s decisions to hop 
off the train in Vienna with the 
beautiful and French Julie Delpy 
seems like a no-brainer, the night 
animates the entire rest of their 
lives.

Many believe it is the very 

nature of love to be fleeting. The 
examples are countless, but look at 
these elegant lyrics from the song 
“Who Wants Love,” by Gus Kahn 
and Franz Wexman, and made 
famous by Billie Holiday:

Who wants love?
Love is a joy we borrow
Pay back in tears tomorrow
So who wants love?
Who wants love?

Something to fill your heart with
So very soon to part with
So who wants love?
So you might say that love 

is comfortable in a temporary 
setting. In your situation, Luct, the 
temporariness of your setting may 
well be enabling, even intensifying, 
your love. Go with it; who’s to say 
it’s not the best kind?

And really, you can’t ever fully 

possess anyone, even if you were 
not scheduled for an imminent 
parting of ways. Consider this 
passage from Mark Merlis’s novel 
“The Arrow’s Flight,” which 
sets American gay culture of the 
late ’70s within a classical Greek 
framework:

“Do you know how sometimes 

you see a man, and you’re not sure 
if you want to get in his pants or if 
you want to cry? Not because you 
can’t have him; maybe you can: 
But you see right away something 
in him beyond having. You can’t 
screw your way into it, any more 
than you can get at the golden 
eggs by slitting the goose. So you 
want to cry, not like a child, but 
like an exile who is reminded of 
his homeland. That’s what Leucon 
saw when he first beheld Pyrrhus: 
as if he were getting a glimpse of 
that other place we were meant to 
be, the shore from which we were 
deported before we were born.”

The lesson, beautifully 

intensified in the passage, is that 
owning your lover’s perpetual 
time may be an illusion and being 
with them in the moment, as you 
say, may be the only, or best, thing 
there is.

NT. STUDENT PUBLI-
CATIONS NEWSROOM, 
NIGHT

A table full of misfits, a com-

puter that barely works, six 
friends 
brought 
together 
by fate and 
a shared 
appreciation 
for Courtney 
Barnett. 
Our heroine, 
CHLOE, is 
dressed up 
in one of 
her several 
frilly black 
shirts. She knows it’s a special 
night — a season finale of sorts. 
It’s her last nightside shift at 
The Michigan Daily. She edits 
a Rick Ross album review and 
lays the articles out on the page, 
exports them to the printer. She 
is disappointed how normally 
everything goes. No excitement, 
a well-written but unfulfilling 
ending to such an excellent show. 
B+.

And then it’s finished. The 

underclassmen leave. THE 
ONLY OTHER SENIOR goes to 
a club meeting or study session 
or something. She bullies one of 
her co-editors into staying at the 
table with her, then encourages 
him to read her senior goodbye, 
which she knows will probably 
make him cry. He suddenly leaves 
mid-read, and she is alone at the 
table. She puts on music to fill 
the void. “Don’t Dream It’s Over” 
comes on her shuffled IPOD 
and her eyes well up. Within a 
few minutes, she is out of her 
beloved newsroom and openly 
sobbing and gasping for breath 
at a red light.

Chloe has seen enough TV 

finales to know when she’s liv-
ing one. It’s the last night of 
production at The Michigan 
Daily, maybe the last time she’ll 
be paid to do journalism. It’s the 
last night she’ll spend with these 
beautiful friends without having 
to catch up, ask what’s new or 
comment on who grew a beard 
in the nine weeks since she has 
seen him. Even though she’s 
supposed to stay back at the 
Daily and do senior activities, 
she needs a few minutes to sort 
herself out.

She crawls into bed with her 

iPod, scouring her collection 
to find a song that’s a worthy 
score to her hurricane of emo-
tions. She settles on “Holy Shit,” 
a song that Father John Misty 
wrote on the day of his wedding 
to express the ambivalent terror 
and hope he felt about mov-
ing into a new phase of his life. 
“Holy Shit” ’s lyrics are mostly 
cynical nonsense, but sometimes 
the searing guitar and piano 
break through for a lyric or two 
that make your heart stop from 
their sincerity.

Oh, and love is just an institu-

tion based on human frailty / 
What’s your paradise gotta do with 
Adam and Eve? / Maybe love is 
just an economy based on resource 
scarcity / But what I fail to see is 
what that’s gotta do with you and 
me.

For a half hour, she listens to 

the song on repeat, the last 30 sec-
onds punching her rawer every 
time, and texts the FRIEND 
WHO LEFT to apologize for 
being shitty and making him read 
her goodbye at the table. She’s a 
slave to dramatic narrative. She 
just wanted a good finale.

***
Since that night in December, 

I could list off a dozen others that 
have felt like finales — Friday 
night at Rick’s when they played 
“Toxic” and I had a serendipitous 
run-in with a recurring character 
from a few seasons ago, buying a 
graduation gown in the Student 
Publications building conference 
room while “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” 
played from someone’s laptop, 
texting a friend from a hotel room 
in Austin and feeling every mile of 
the distance between us. I’m try-
ing to keep an album of these little 
goodbyes, because the real ones 
are coming soon enough, and I’m 
not prepared to say them.

In August, I’m moving to Aus-

tin for grad school. My friends 
are scattering across the country, 
some immediately, some in a 
year or two. I don’t know anyone 
in Texas (unless you count the 
Taylor family from “Friday Night 
Lights”), and I’ll be a three hour 

plane ride from all my friends and 
family. I wish I could say I was 
excited, but it’s hard to stomach a 
fresh start when you’re so in love 
with the places and the people 
and the life you’ve got right now. 
This dream and future are com-
ing closer and faster, but none of it 
feels real — at least, not as real as 
my place in line at Zingerman’s, 
April snow flurries in my hair or 
a hug from my best friend who is 
right here. It’s a lot to let go of. I 
don’t know how to do it.

During the last few minutes 

of the “Six Feet Under” series 
finale, Claire Fisher says some-
thing along these same lines. 
She is leaving her family for the 
first time to set off for New York, 
where she’ll get her dream job as 
a photographer. But the dream 
doesn’t feel real, and it’s the 
hardest thing she has ever done 
to stand on her porch and hug 
the real ones goodbye. “I have 
no idea how to do this,” Claire 
admits to her brother David.

“Just say goodbye. Just say 

I love you, I’ll miss you.” The 
rest of her family files out to the 
porch to bid Claire farewell, and 
she pulls out her camera to take 
one last photo of everyone stand-
ing together. Her older brother 
Nate appears below her on the 
porch, a talking ghost or halluci-
nation or just the person Claire 
needed to see, her twin soul that 
passed away earlier in the show’s 
final season. He leans into her 
ear and whispers some words of 
wisdom and tells her how to say 
goodbye.

“You can’t take a picture of 

this. It’s already gone.”

Since I first watched this epi-

sode five years ago, I’ve tried to 
make sense of this haunting line. 
I think I finally get it. The porch 
is the gateway to a new part of 
Claire’s life, and now that she’s 
on the porch, she has already 
started to move away. Every 
second that ticks by is gone with 
the next tick, time stretching and 
pulling Claire farther from this 
version of herself and her life. 
The way Nate says this line is 
peaceful, like he’s telling Claire 
not to cling desperately to these 
dying moments, but to cherish 
each of them as they’re happen-
ing and let go as they slip away. 
Let the dream guide you, let the 
picture of happiness stay mythic 
and imagined, don’t try too hard 
to re-live the finale.

***
A week or two ago, following 

one of my finale nights, I had 
a dream I was on the shores of 
coastal Greece, falling into a 
quick and desperate affair with 
Ezra Koenig, the lead singer of 
Vampire Weekend. I’ve had a few 
dreams about celebrities before 
— probably a symptom of my 
general pop culture obsession or 
the fact that I listened to Modern 
Vampires of the City earlier that 
night. The dream with Ezra was 
by far the most vivid I’ve ever 
had. It played out in full like a 
movie — specifically, like a com-
plete rip-off of “Before Sunrise.”

Ezra and I met by the beach. 

We’d both been living in Greece 
for a while but never crossed 
paths before, which I guess 
sometimes happens with people 
who become your best friends. 
You’re existing in parallel, walk-
ing down the same street and 
thinking the same things and 
loving the same movies, yet 
somehow never knowing that 
person on the other side of the 
gulf.

We talked about the stuff 

we love first, because the way 
we related to each other was by 
sharing our opinions about TV 
and music and art. He was really 
jazzed about the upcoming LCD 
Soundsystem festival reunion 
tour and we recited all the lyrics 
to “All My Friends” to each other 
while standing in the ocean.

And if the sun comes up, if the 

sun comes up, if the sun comes up 
and I still don’t wanna stagger 
home / Then it’s the memory of 
our betters / That are keeping us 
on our feet.

Ezra reminded me of home, 

something I hadn’t felt in all the 
months I was living in Greece. 
He wasn’t from Ann Arbor or my 
Illinois hometown or anything, 
but I felt like he’d been traveling 
alongside me the whole time. 
We loved the same things in the 
same way — with earnestness 
and sincerity and a double dose 
of passion. I couldn’t think of 

anyone I’d rather walk the dream 
streets of Island City, Greece 
with.

***
After a few hours of lazy 

dream haziness, I was feeling 
especially candid and wanted to 
let Ezra know how I felt about 
him before I lost my courage. 
I was so glad I’d spent this day 
with him, so glad we could talk 
about things we loved and know 
somebody else saw the world the 
same way 
— 
 this world of beauti-

ful and silly things, dumb jokes 
and good veggie burgers, nights 
like this where we feel like we’re 
the only people awake in Island 
City and all its gorgeous splendor 
is ours for the taking. I wanted 
to stretch our night into forever. 
So did he.

We made the impulsive deci-

sion to take spaceships to Mars, 
because we’d always wanted to 
go there, and we felt the clock 
ticking closer to morning and 
our inevitable parting. Ezra and 
I wanted to get to a place where 
time couldn’t hurt us anymore 
and those gorgeous moments 
didn’t have to die. We’d sit on 
Mars and look out at little Earth 
below, smiling at how beautiful 
Island City looks in August from 
a million miles away.

Still, I could feel our paths 

sorting out into parallel again. I 
was meant to wake up from this 
dream and we were meant to 
separate. We were taking indi-
vidual spaceships to Mars, and I 
was already resigned to the fact 
that we wouldn’t get there at the 
same time.

Complex ‘Krisha’

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

If family gatherings are the 

stuff of horror, then Thanksgiving 
must be the ultimate terror. Com-
plicated histories, strange man-
nerisms and different cultures all 

converge for the sake of “family,” 
whatever that word means.

In “Krisha,” the debut fea-

ture 
by 
writer-director 
Trey 

Edward Shults, we’re made privy 
to one such horror story. On its 
surface, “Krisha” tells a simple 
story: a woman in her sixties, the 

titular Krisha (Krisha Fairchild, 
“The Killing of John Lennon”), 
estranged from her family and 
a recovering alcoholic and drug 
addict, returns for a Thanksgiv-
ing dinner. Slowly, the complex 
linkages between Krisha and her 
sisters, brothers-in-law, nephews 

and nieces all unravel, leaving 
Krisha in a delicate space.

“Krisha” is a film you should 

see 
alone. 

That’s not to 
say 
I 
didn’t 

enjoy compa-
ny during my 
viewing, 
but 

to sit alone in a 
darkened the-
ater, staring at 
this woman’s 
struggles with no one to turn to, 
must be a singularly horrifying 
experience. I first drew a com-
parison to Stanley Kubrick’s “The 
Shining,” a tale of isolation in an 
isolated place. But “Krisha” tells 
a story of isolation amid a large 
group of people — even the people 
one should be closest with. Krisha 
often sulks upstairs, away from 
the action, looking down at them 
from her window (the spatial logic 
of the house, like in “The Shining,” 
is labyrinthine). She turns more 
quickly to her box of prescription 
pills than her family.

“Krisha,” at times, feels like if 

Terrence Malick did something 
like “The Shining.” This is only 
natural, as Shults worked as an 
assistant for Malick on a number 
of his films before helming “Kri-
sha.” Shults uses a wide-ranging 
palette of sounds to simulate Kri-
sha’s sobering experiences. In the 
kitchen, the sounds of the tele-
vision blasting ESPN or of kids 
bouncing balls on the floor seem 
almost comical in their juxtapo-
sition with the beeping score (lit-
eral beeps are a large component 
of the truly sinisterly terrifying 
score), and Krisha doesn’t seem 
pleased. For her, family comes 
with the baggage of sensory over-
load itself, and Shults doesn’t hold 
back in letting us know what she’s 
feeling. One particular climac-
tic scene is rendered in a blur of 
words, actions and visions. Sud-
denly, the act of cooking the tur-
key has turned into a nightmarish 
daze.

Shults’s debut is made all the 

more impressive by the sheer low-

budget factor of it all. Shults wrote, 
directed, edited and starred in 
the film. Most of the actors are 
his actual family members. He 
also doesn’t mind using his own 
personal information in the film. 
Shults, who studied business 
management in college and then 
dropped out to follow his pas-
sion of making films, portrays the 
conveniently named Trey, who is 
currently studying — you guessed 
it — business management while 
harboring aspirations of becom-
ing — right again — a filmmaker.

Fairchild’s performance is sim-

ply incredible. From her clothes 
to her bags to the way she walks 
and talks to herself, we know this 
character. Disheveled yet caring, 
Krisha has long been separated 
from her family and her anticipa-
tion for seeing them again is met 
by an equally strong anxiety. Her 
life is in shambles, to put it lightly, 
but she herself is fun and funny. 
This we can gather from the open-
ing moments of the film. Every-
thing after is icing on the cake.

“When you’re away from home — and taking exams 

— it’s a huge transition,” Rondenelli said. “Plus, it’s 
such an opportunity to just isolate yourself and just let 
things get out of control.”

A balancing act
The services the University provides for students 

struggling with mental health issues span several 
arenas.

CAPS, the main University resource for mental 

health, spans three prongs: clinical, outreach and 
training. Within clinical aspects of CAPS, resources are 
divided between providing ongoing services and the 
demands of new requests and crisis appointments.

According to CAPS director Todd Sevig, the 

distribution of counselors currently heavily prioritizes 
short-term care. Sevig said one of the largest challenges 
for CAPS is how their counselors — to whom the largest 
portion of the program’s funding goes toward paying — 
are distributed within CAPS.

Reichel said he sought help from CAPS near the 

end of September of his freshman year and found the 
experience to be beneficial in helping him adjust to 
campus and learn to deal with his depression.

“It was definitely very, very helpful,” Reichel said. 

“Normally they don’t do (long-term) therapy there that 
much. Normally they just figure out what’s going on and 
help you find somewhere out in the community to send 
you to. They kept me around.”

Reichel noted, however, that there are some issues 

with the current system that he believes could be 
resolved through increasing resources and funding to 
the center.

“In regard to CAPS, they have really great stuff and 

they have really great people and they’re doing a lot 
of good things to help out — there just isn’t enough,” 
Reichel said.

For many, that sense of not having enough is frequent 

with CAPS — especially with long-term care like the 
kind Reichel received, for which funding is noticeably 
limited.

Since 2011, CAPS’ budget has increased by more 

than 30 percent. In 2016, CAPS received $3.0 million in 
funding from the University’s General Fund — the vast 
majority of which goes to counselor salaries, according 
to Sevig. Other funding for projects come from 
donations: The Gatof Foundation funded the creation of 
CAPS’ After Hours hotline and the CAPS Stress Busters 
app, and funding from the Logan Family Foundation 
created a QPR (Question Persuade and Refer) training 
video for new faculty and students aiming to prevent 
suicide.

But this increase in funding has been accompanied 

by significant increases in demand. Last year CAPS had 
more than 25,000 appointments — about 1,300 of which 
were crisis appointments. The numbers break down to 
4,197 individual patients seen for clinical services in the 
last year alone.

Every year for the past five years, CAPS has 

experienced an average increase in appointments of 
7 to 9 percent. This year, the average increase for the 
Fall semester in comparison to that of last year was 
20 to 25 percent. During one of the first few weeks of 
the semester, CAPS experienced a 43 percent increase 
in new appointments. CAPS staff, in contrast, has not 
increased at nearly that pace, according to Christine 
Adiado, CAPS’ associate director of community 
engagement and outreach.

“There is a 43 percent increase from 2010 to now — 

our staff has not increased 43 percent,” Adiado said

Sevig said the increases have prompted CAPS 

personnel to start looking for new answers in how they 
do things, a conversation he added that the program 
can’t have on its own.

“What we’re all trying to figure out is sort of new 

answers to new questions: What if next year we have 
a 40 percent increase? And then the year after that? 
What is the best way to meet that level of student needs 
on mental health?” Sevig said. “That’s where we can’t 
figure this out on our own, we need to answer those 
questions together with students — including faculty, 
staff and administration. We can adapt, we can add, 
but if that level of increases continues then we have to 
rethink some new ways.”

For CAPS, the patient increases are a double-edged 

sword: While on one hand the counseling center is 
happy to see new clients and more students on campus 
seeking help, the increase in demand leads to resources 
stretched thin. CAPS staff said they largely credit the 
recent increase in students seeking help in the past five 
years to an increased de-stigmatization of seeking help 
for mental health issues.

“I don’t know if anyone’s figured out the answer (to 

the increase in demand) but what people are seeing and 
what we’ve experienced both anecdotally and looking 
at our data, there are a few multiple reasons,” Sevig 
said. “The first is stigma has decreased over this time 
period.”

Sevig pointed to several University outreach 

mechanisms as potential reasons for that decrease, 
such as the “Do Something” campaign, which promotes 
a positive campus environment. He estimated that 
at least 15,000 students are influenced by outreach 
initiatives such as those annually.

“When we wake up in the morning we are devoted to 

the people who walk in our doors — our clinical work,” 
Sevig said. “But when we wake up we are also trying to 
think of literally every student and also the culture of 
this place, the campus climate around mental health. 
And that’s where I think both of these things — when 
I think of the last five to 10 years this is a big part of the 
increase.”

The wait
The limited resources of CAPS is manifested most 

readily for students in appointment wait time — it’s 
one of the most talked about complaints students have 
about CAPS, and one that has seen a renewed push of 
attention this semester.

Kinesiology freshman Shanze Noorani, who is not 

affiliated with any mental health advocacy groups on 
campus, is currently petitioning to increase funding for 
CAPS. To date, the petition, which emphasizes the need 
for shorter appointment wait times, has garnered 1,836 
signatures.

“I think it’s something everyone does feel really 

passionately about,” Noorani said. “It’s one of those 
things. I think I actually got a lot of support because it’s 
not like a debatable thing; I think it’s pretty much across 
the board that everyone feels that this is an important 
issue — especially here at Michigan.”

Noorani said when the petition reaches 5,000 

signatures she intends to present it to University 
administration.

“Currently, wait times to make appointments 

here are approximately 3 weeks long, which is not 
very beneficial to those that are suffering NOW,” 
Noorani’s petition reads. “If funding for CAPS is 
increased, more staff members can be hired so more 
students can make appointments and work through 
their hardships. In order to make our campus a more 
conducive environment to preventing tragedies like 
this from occurring, mental health services should be 
made a priority so that those suffering from depression, 
anxiety, and other mental health disorders can get the 
help that they need.”

Noorani said in her own experience, CAPS wait 

times have been problematic.

“I’ve tried to make appointments there multiple 

times and I always end up having to cancel it because 
you have to make it three weeks in advance, and, like, 
who knows what they’re doing in three weeks? Or if 
they’re even going to need it in three weeks?” Noorani 
said. “I think the main thing they could improve is 
hiring more people that are available to talk to. I’m not 
saying CAPS is the worst thing because I know it has 
helped so many people, which is great, but there are 
also so many more people that it could be helping.”

In response to the petition, Sevig said the three-week 

wait periods aren’t true.

“It’s never been three weeks; it’s a myth and a 

misunderstanding.”

Business junior Kelly Lewis said her first time making 

an appointment at CAPS was difficult. She was told she 
would have to wait two weeks to get an appointment, 
but when she asked if there were any other options she 
was pointed to see the on-call counselor, which she said 
worked out fine for her.

Lewis discovered last semester she had a physical 

disability causing her eyes to not see at the same time. 
Soon, her disability began to have a negative effect on 
her mental health as well. Lewis said she lost trust in 
her body — everything she thought she perceived, her 
mind doubted.

Lewis didn’t not need long-term counseling, but said 

even the short period she dealt with CAPS scheduling 
was a hassle.

“I really enjoy my counselor, and have a lot of good 

experiences with him, but it is frustrating — even 
as someone using the resource — trying to set up an 
appointment,” Lewis said. “Even though I’m in the 
system, and set up to see him, we have a very hard time 
scheduling.”

Adiado said she thought perceptions of long wait 

time may stem from scheduling issues.

“I think it is more of the student not being able to 

make an earlier time so the thing that maybe works 
with their schedule is a couple of weeks later, but it’s not 
because we have a waitlist or a wait time of two weeks 
or three weeks,” Adiado said. “It’s really essentially 
eight days.”

The wait period for appointments is updated daily on 

the CAPS website.

A focus on North Campus
Reichel, who noted feelings of isolation as a freshman 

in Bursley, isn’t alone in his sentiments on the necessity 
of increasing services to North Campus as part of 
increasing CAPS service. 

In recent weeks, multiple organizations across 

campus have called for reform to North Campus 
options. LSA senior Marlee Beckering and five other 
students recently started the Help CAPS Catch Up 
Campaign, a group advocating for better mental health 
resources on campus. The campaign, which began as 
a project for the course Organizational Studies 203, 
aims to find ways to better increase CAPS’ resources. 
On April 6th, the Campaign launched its survey of 
students on what they would like to see done to address 
mental health on campus. The survey is still open and 
collecting data but thus far the top two responses were 
increasing funding overall and increasing resources for 
students on North Campus.

Engineering freshman A.J. Ashman president of 

Bursley Hall, said he believes the University needs to do 
a better job at broadcasting the mental health resources 
available. In particular, he said he felt there was a need 
for a CAPS clinic on North Campus given that the 
majority of students there are freshmen and may be 
having trouble adjusting to college.

Though there is no branch of CAPS on North 

Campus, there are counselors available for students in 
colleges based on North Campus, such as the College 
of Engineering and College of Music, Theatre & Dance. 
CAPS launched the program of “embedded counselors” 
two years ago as part of a restructuring of the system 
to reduce wait times, and has since expanded to 
professional schools on Central Campus as well, 
hiring seven new counselors for the initiative. Each 
school on North Campus has one embedded counselor 
whom students in need can e-mail for an appointment. 
This past year CAPS expanded the initiative into 
professional schools such as Law, Business, Rackham 
and Dentistry, and are working on a study to see the 
benefits of the program — hoping to ultimately expand 
it into other colleges.

In recent months, Central Student Government and 

LSA Student Government have each proposed several 
resolutions to broaden mental health services onto 
North Campus. CSG party newMICH, who recently 
won the CSG presidential election, ran partially on the 
platform of creating a CAPS center on North Campus, 
along with hiring 11 new counselors to decrease the 
ratio of counselors to students from the current 1:1,300 
to 1:1,000.

At a recent LSA Student Government meeting, LSA 

sophomore Nicholas Meier, who proposed a resolution 
for a campus-wide “Mental Health Day,” highlighted 
the importance of increasing mental health resources 
in “isolated” areas of campus like North Campus.

“People should not be prevented from having access 

to the same resources as other students just because of 
where they were randomly assigned to live,” he said. 
“We need to get something there now, so they can get 
the help they need now. Not in a month or five years, 
but now.”

Students who live on North note that it often has a 

worse reputation of isolation or lack of community 
than the reality. Ashman said Bursley Hall Council 
works hard to promote activities to build a sense of 
community.

Baits II residents Sabrina Wong and Elan Johnson, 

both LSA freshman, echoed Ashman’s sentiments, 
saying while logistic issues like buses to Central 
Campus are not ideal, there is a sense of community. 

That given, Wong said she “didn’t know how isolating 
North Campus would be” until she got on campus, and 
while there are benefits of the community setting, she 
said there are noticeable drawbacks.

“It’s kind of nice to have your own community to 

escape to” Wong said. “I think that the social aspect 
of it, I think it’s a lot harder. I live in Baits so your own 
house is like your own community and there’s like 
maybe 200 people that live in a house. It’s really quiet 
and unsocial. If I lived in Markley or East Quad or South 
Quad, I feel like I’d have a lot more people to talk to and 
hang out with.”

Johnson said Baits Residence Hall does a good job of 

promoting social activities and creating a community.

“It’s a little bit isolating but if you make the most of 

it then it’s not as bad as everybody says,” Johnson said. 
“I think if anyone gets on North Campus, while it is 
sometimes disappointing, if you make the most of it 
then I think it’s not as bad as everyone says it is.”

Reichel said overall, expanding resources would 

have helped students like him.

“Being on North Campus, coming down to the 

Union can be hard at times, too,” she said “If they had 
a satellite clinic or something up on North that would 
be cool, too.”

Moving forward
The increase in demand, though it’s prompted student 

outcry and concerns, has also been accompanied by 
University and student efforts to provide more services 
and shift campus culture.

Initiatives such as the embedded counselor program 

have already seen progress in reducing wait time. When 
the program was implemented two years ago, wait 
times were cut 60 percent to an average wait time of 
four days, according to CAPS.

One of the main pillars of the Help CAPS Catch Up 

Campaign is ensuring funding is at a satisfactory ratio 
based on the research of Daniel Eisenberg, an associate 
professor in the Department of Health Management 
and Policy at the University, who found that college 
counseling centers should have $1 million per every 
15,000 students. Under the increase in the 2016 budget, 
CAPS is now receiving what Eisenberg deems is the 
proper amount — prior to this year, though, it was below.

Lewis said another initiative the campaign supports 

is one Central Student Government has mentioned 
implementing: a mental health liaison for student 
organizations. This would be a person who is trained 
in the resources on campus, though not necessarily a 
counselor themselves.

“I’m in a 300-person organization,” Lewis said. “If 

somebody is having a moment where they just need 
to figure out who to go and talk to, they can go to this 
person and say, ‘Hey, who do I go see? What’s the 
wait time like at these different places? What are my 
options?’ ”

Beckering was interested in working to improve 

mental health resources after dealing with her own 
issues and experiencing others’ firsthand — noting 
countless instances of the impact of mental health issues 
in her sorority. She said she believes the widespread 
nature of mental health issues is a result of counselor’s 
limited resources.

“Unfortunately, one of my (sorority) sisters 

committed suicide as a sophomore. As a 19-year-old 
I had to plan her memorial service and support other 
19-year-olds who were going through a period of loss, 
and that was really, really hard,” Beckering said. “Then 
when I was a junior, I intervened in a situation where 
someone was trying to commit suicide. There have 
been so many other situations throughout my college 
career where I’ve seen people who aren’t able to gain 
access to what they need — and that’s including myself.”

The group has also found lack of long-term care 

in the form of follow ups after CAP appointments is 
an area students feel CAPS is less effective in due to 
underfunding.

Beckering said several suggestions have been made 

to alleviate this, such as having CAPS call patients who 
skip their appointments, or check in on them after they 
are referred to an alternative private practice to see how 
it’s going.

“CAPS doesn’t have the resources to call and check 

in and say, ‘Hey, how are things going with the person 
we referred you to?’ ” Beckering said. “They’re amazing 
people and they have the capacity to make amazing 
change in the people that they do help.”

Smith, who utilized CAPS when struggling with 

mental health after coming to the University, said she 
stopped going after a few sessions. She said she felt her 
counselor wasn’t a good fit for her and she started to 
have anxiety about it, but a follow up visit might have 
helped encourage her to come back.

“Part of me is like, ‘You should probably just try 

again,’ ” Smith said. “But it’s also hard because my 
schedule is really packed. It’s kind of hard because 
CAPS is only open during the day when we have classes, 
but I should probably just try again.”

Overall, students interviewed for this article echoed 

the same sentiment over and over again — any increase 
in campus mental health resources will be a positive.

Across the board, the primary solution presented 

by students was increasing the number of counselors, 
whether at CAPS’ current location, a new North 
Campus clinic, or more embedded counselors.

Sevig said he was interested in hearing student 

input on what steps should be taken moving forward to 
improve CAPS. Improvement models CAPS is currently 
considering, he said, include whether to expand the 
embedded counselor program or change the current 
model’s focus away from prioritizing crisis work, as well 
as more attention to ongoing follow up appointments.

“Yes, we’re all aware of what’s going on right now,” 

Sevig said in regard to student concerns. “There’s a 
lot of student cries and demands: ‘We love CAPS, we 
need more CAPS.’ We’re all hearing it. What we’re all 
trying to figure out quickly is what is the best way to 
meet student needs, but don’t forget the president, the 
provost, the vice president of student life have decided 
to add seven new staff members in the last two years. 
That’s not a small thing.”

In an interview, E. Royster Harper, vice president 

of student life, echoed Sevig’s sentiments, saying the 
administration wants to hear students voices on the 
subject.

“We are open to hearing what students are saying 

and we are open to making changes based on what 
students are saying.”

Hill, Michigan 
defeat Nebraska 
to complete three-
game home sweep

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

On 
March 
22, 
2015, 
the 

Michigan baseball team lost 6-3 
to Nebraska, its third straight 
loss to the Cornhuskers.

One year later, the now-22nd 

ranked Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 
25-9 overall) turned the 2015 
result on its head, defeating the 
Cornhuskers, 6-1, completing a 
three-game sweep. 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich 

downplayed the feat.

“We really went into (the 

weekend) talking about each 
game as a one-game series,” 
Bakich said. “We didn’t use the 
word ‘sweep.’ ”

The 
Wolverines’ 
victory 

came on the back of masterful 
pitching, 
particularly 
the 

performance from senior left-
hander Evan Hill. He threw for 

seven innings, surrendered one 
run on four hits, walked one 
batter and struck out four.

“I threw a lot of fastballs 

today,” Hill said. “I was moving it 
in and out.”

Sophomore Ryan Nutof picked 

up where Hill left off. He finished 
the contest with two scoreless 
innings and two strikeouts.

The game remained scoreless 

until the bottom of the fourth 
inning when senior centerfielder 
Cody Bruder singled up the 
middle before stealing second 
base on the next at-bat.

Sophomore first baseman Drew 

Lugbauer brought Bruder home 
with an RBI double to right field.

Michigan 
was 
unable 
to 

capitalize further, though, as 
freshman 
shortstop 
Michael 

Brdar struck out swinging and 
freshman right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann grounded out to end 
the frame.

“Those guys in the middle of 

the order did a nice job of staying 
connected with the guys who hit 
in front of them,” Bakich said, 
referring to hitters three through 
six. “Each got on base a few times 
and took advantage of some 

situations to capitalize.”

Nebraska (7-5 Big Ten, 22-14 

overall) threatened to erase the 
Wolverines’ newfound lead in the 
top of the fifth, when left fielder 
Luis Alvarado hit a one-out 
double down the left-field line.

But two batters later, after 

a Nebraska base hit, senior 
Wolverine 
left 
fielder 
Matt 

Ramsay made a perfect throw to 
home plate to tag out Alvarado 
and preserve Michigan’s 1-0 edge.

“Getting the defense back in to 

hit is huge for momentum shifts,” 
Bruder said. “Hats off to them.”

Nebraska 
managed 
to 
tie 

the game in the sixth as first 
baseman Ben Miller hit a two-out 
RBI single.

The Wolverines responded 

right away, though, in the bottom 
of the frame. With senior catcher 
Harrison Wenson on first and 
junior designated hitter Carmen 
Benedetti on second, Bruder 
singled up the middle to score 
Benedetti. Lugbauer then hit a 
sacrifice bunt to put two runners 
in scoring position with one out.

After Brdar reached on a 

fielder’s choice to load the bases, 

Wolverines top 
Ohio State in 

come-from-behind 

fashion, 5-3

By TYLER COADY

Daily Sports Writer

As Ohio State centerfielder 

Taylor White crossed home plate, 
a quiet hush fell over Alumni 
Field, except for a pocket of 
scarlet-clad fans cheering wildly. 
White’s hit bounced off the left-
field wall, alluded the gloves of 
junior left fielder Kelly Christner 
and senior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence and allowed her to 
notch an inside-the-park home 
run.

The Buckeyes had cut the 

Wolverines’ lead to one, as 
junior 
right-handed 
pitcher 

Megan Betsa’s bid for a second 
straight shutout vanished in the 
fourth inning.

“It didn’t seem like we were 

very locked in,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “I said to 
the team, ‘(Betsa) is doing her 

part, and go give her some energy 
because you just let her down.’

“I don’t think we are giving 

enough right now, and we are 
getting a little self-absorbed.”

Holding onto a tenuous 2-1 

lead at the onset of the fifth 
inning, the Michigan defense 
once again lost its poise as 
senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero bobbled a ball, allowing 
Ohio State first baseman Jess 
Machovina to reach on an 
infield hit. After Betsa walked 
right 
fielder 
Alex 
Bayne, 

Buckeyes’ left fielder Cammi 
Prantl made the Wolverines 
pay for its poor fielding, as her 
double into the right-center 
field gap scored two, putting 
Ohio State (9-4-1 Big Ten, 25-11-
1 overall) in front, 3-2.

“Bonnie (Tholl) went over and 

… told them the game plan: Hit 
the ball in the ground,” Hutchins 
said. “I think getting behind 
woke them up … but I thought 
their energy during the whole 
game was not very good.”

As 
the 
coaching 
staff 

attempted to spark its team, it 
stressed that there were two 
innings left to play. A lack of 

confidence, 
not 
talent, 
was 

contributing 
to 
their 
poor 

performance. The Wolverines 
(11-2, 33-4) entered the bottom of 
fifth with the top of their lineup 
due up to bat.

Romero and Susalla quickly 

got 
on 
base 
after 
drawing 

walks, 
and 
then 
sophomore 

first baseman Tera Blanco, who 
drove in Michigan’s second run, 
stepped up to the plate. Ohio 
State coach and Wolverine alum 
Kelly Kovach Schoenly walked 
out to the circle, attempting to 
inject a sense of confidence into 
her suddenly shaken pitcher, 
Shelby Hursh.

After seeing the first two 

pitches go high, Blanco latched 
onto the third one, sent it over the 
center-field wall for a three-run 
home run and vaulted Michigan 
into the lead.

“I mean, I was just really 

excited,” Blanco said. “I was just 
really excited to come home to 
my team.”

Blanco’s home run provided 

the Wolverines all the breathing 
room 
they 
would 
need, 
as 

Betsa returned to the mound

A plan fulfilled and a reluctant goodbye
T

his column, I’m fairly 
certain, is the product 
of a long and arduous 

brainwashing 
process by 
my dad.

It started 

when I was 6 
years old. I’d 
noticed that 
he always 
read The 
Philadelphia 
Inquirer 
every day 
before he left 
for work and I left for school. 
He’d tell me what was in the 
paper, and by the end of first 
grade, I wanted to read it, too.

So every single morning at 

6:30, we’d sit at our kitchen 
table to split the sports section 
and discuss its contents. I 
wanted to know everything, 
and when I held the newspaper, 
it seemed as if the world was at 
my fingertips. I wanted to hold 
on to that feeling forever.

Simultaneously, my dad, 

who had earned his MBA from 
Michigan, had another plan. 
He’d give me a few pieces 
of Michigan clothing every 
year for Chanukkah and then, 
on Saturdays, he’d turn on 
Michigan football games. We’d 
watch together, dancing around 
the living room after every 
Braylon Edwards touchdown. 

When I was 11, he took me 

to the Big House for the first 
time. The game was a relatively 
boring blowout of Eastern 
Michigan, but I was hooked 
anyway. By the time I was a 
sophomore in high school, I 
wore Michigan T-shirts three 
days a week (I was really 
freaking cool).

When it came time to pick a 

college, my mom forced me to 
look at other schools, convinced 
I only thought Michigan was 
the best fit because of my 
dad’s prerogative. I ended up 
here anyway, writing about 
Michigan sports for the 
newspaper.

And now, four years later, it’s 

time to say goodbye. And shoot, 
I’ll admit it, I really don’t want to.

Saying goodbye means no 

more walking through the Diag 
exchanging fist bumps with 
passing friends while complete 
strangers offer free hugs. It 
means no more nights at Red 
House full of Admiral Nelson 

and beer pong until everyone 
is too drunk and too tired to do 
anything but sleep. It means 
no more sitting at the Daily 
until 4 a.m. with Max and Jake, 
ranting and yelling and talking 
about life until we remember 
we have to go to class in just a 
few short hours.

Sure, it hasn’t all been perfect. 

Simon and I (somehow) never 
met our wives at Rick’s, and I 
wish we had shut out The State 
News every year instead of merely 
embarrassing them. There were 
times I could’ve studied more, 
and there were times I ignored 
my non-Daily friends for way 
too long. Even worse, people still 
don’t believe I’m actually in Ross 
(tell them, Henry).

It’s funny how life works 

out sometimes. Because of the 
Daily, I’ve done things I would 
have only dreamed about as 
a little kid. I’ve played catch 
under the lights on the field 
at the Big House, I’ve driven 
all over the Midwest to cover 
football road games and I even 
had a summer internship at the 
newspaper I grew up reading.

I’ve also spent the last four 

years listening to athletes and 
coaches utter platitudes about 
toughness only to realize the 
best example of it has been in 
front of me for my entire life. 

My mom has had multiple 

sclerosis since 1983, when 
she was 22 years old. In 1992, 
one year before I was born, 
the disease rendered the left 
side of her body numb. On the 
rare occasions when she feels 
it’s necessary to mention the 
disease, she says the sensation 
is comparable to a normal 
person’s foot falling asleep. 
The only difference is that her 
affliction is permanent.

When she was diagnosed, she 

didn’t know how much longer 
she’d be able to walk. She’s 55 now, 
and she isn’t stopping any time 
soon. For that, I’m truly lucky.

I’ve been fortunate, too, to have 

friends who have helped me along 
the way. It doesn’t feel as if it was 
all that long ago when Austin had 
to convince a scared freshman to 
drive across the country with him 
to the Final Four. 

But the problem with college, 

it seems, is that it’s so fleeting. 
One moment Spike Albrecht 
is scoring 17 points in the 
National Championship game 
and then, in the blink of an eye, 

he’s a graduate transfer. 

I suppose we’ll all go places 

after graduation, too. We don’t 
really have much of a choice. 
Matan’s moving to Africa, 
Karly’s going to Boston and I’ll 
go to New York. It will be weird, 
being so far away from this big, 
beautiful, confusing place.

They don’t have Zingerman’s 

out in the real world, I’ve been 
told. The same goes for the 
other places we’ve all grown to 

cherish, from Hill Auditorium 
to the Diag to the Law Quad. 
Sometimes, I’m quite confident, 
the most frequent reminder of 
Ann Arbor will be seeing Jim 
Harbaugh in the news.

But when Lev comes to visit 

or when I get a text from Marc, 
it will be as if we never left this 
place that’s known for a 107,601-
seat football stadium but has 
given us all so much more.

The day before classes started 

my freshman year, I sat by 
the Cube and waited for Wass 
to take me to my first sports 
section meeting. I was sweaty, 
nervous and had no idea what 
I’d say when I was meeting new 
people. I thought writing for the 
Daily would be a hobby, a nice 
little way to spend time outside 
of pursuing a business degree. 

I ended up having more fun 

than I ever thought I could. And 
now that it’s all over and I’m 

writing my final sentences for 
this newspaper, I’m once again 
at a loss for words.

So I’ll say this: Thanks, Dad. 

Your plan worked to perfection.

his mom and Rachel, too. He will

‘M’ capitalizes in rare top-25 series

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 2 Michigan softball 

team entered its conference 
schedule with just two losses: 
against No. 1 Florida and then-
No. 9 Washington.

After garnering eight straight 

Big Ten Championships, the 
Wolverines rarely encounter a 
conference foe they cannot beat. 
And this year, Michigan’s Big Ten 
schedule consists of three of the 
bottom five teams in last season’s 
standings. It does not face No. 
14 Minnesota, the other team 
that consistently challenges the 
Wolverines’ spot at the top.

Instead, Michigan’s conference 

schedule consists of only one 
ranked team: No. 23 Ohio State. 
And the Wolverines took advantage 
of this rare opportunity to compete 
with a top conference team and 
swept the Buckeyes (9-4-1 Big Ten, 
25-11-1 overall), while showing a 
strong effort from top to bottom.

The Wolverines’ cruised in 

their first two games, outscoring 
Ohio State, 13-1, including an 
8-0 run-rule victory on Friday. 
Sunday, though, provided some 
suspense, with the Buckeyes 
taking a 3-2 lead in the fifth 
inning before Michigan came 
back to win, 5-3.

“Occasionally we have more 

of a sense of urgency when we 
go down,” said junior third 
baseman Lindsay Montemarano. 
“It’s like, ‘Oh shoot, we really 
gotta get going,’ and we focus in 
a little bit better.”

Though Michigan’s hitting 

gives it most of its victories, its 
pitching was crucial over the 
weekend. Before allowing three 
runs in Sunday’s game, junior 
right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa 

pitched 21 scoreless innings, 
including two shutouts.

“Megan 
was 
tough,” 
said 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“She was tough because she 
didn’t allow herself to go in any 
direction 
but 

stay focused on 
her 
moment. 

You 
can’t 

control 
what 

they 
do. 
I 

thought 
she 

was fantastic. 
She 
should 

be 
proud 
of 

how hard she 
worked.”

Betsa faced Ohio State right 

fielder Alex Bayne seven times 
in her two starts. Bayne leads the 
nation in home runs with 18 and 
ranks in the top 20 in RBI with 

44. But in seven appearances 
against Betsa, Bayne failed to 
get a hit and walked twice while 
striking out five times.

On 
the 
offensive 
side, 

sophomore catcher Aidan Falk 

raised 
her 

average 
29 

points to .289 
while 
hitting 

a 
home 
run 

and 
driving 

in four runs. 
Sophomore 
first 
baseman 

Tera 
Blanco 

hit a two-run 
home run and 

had five RBI in the series. In one 
of the few moments this Big Ten 
season that the Wolverines faced 
a top pitcher, the team delivered. 
In 11 innings against Buckeye 

right-hander Shelby Hursh, the 
Wolverines scored 11 runs and 
walked nine times.

“Give (Ohio State) credit — 

they’re a good team,” Hutchins 
said. “Hursh pitched fantastic 
today. She had us. She was in 
our head.”

Michigan’s remaining games 

include only one team with a 
winning record. It played nearly 
every remaining team on its 
schedule last season and lost 
only once, when Iowa beat the 
Wolverines, 6-4. 

Because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 

nationally ranked competition 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten, 
Michigan 

looks to make the most of its 
opportunities in these infrequent 
matchups with top teams.

This past weekend, it took 

advantage.

MEN’S GYMNASTICS
McCallum’s title 
caps down year

Team fails to 

qualify for finals at 

national meet

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

All 
season, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s 
gymnastics 
team 
has 

struggled 
with 
the 
same 

problem: 
a 
mediocre 
team 

performance 
contrasted 
with 

flashes of individual greatness. 
This past weekend, at the NCAA 
Championships 
in 
Columbus, 

that trend continued.

The Wolverines (1-6 Big Ten, 

8-23 overall) failed to qualify 
for the final round of the NCAA 
Championships — dubbed the 
Super Six — after a poor showing 
in the preliminary round Friday. 
Six teams competed in two 
sessions, with the top three 
from 
each 

advancing 
to 

the final round 
Saturday.

Michigan 

wasn’t 
close 

to 
qualifying, 

however, 
finishing 
in 

fifth place with 
a score of 422.150. To qualify for 
the Super Six, the Wolverines 
would have needed to outscore Big 
Ten foe Illinois — which scored 
432.050 points — for third place.

“It’s a disappointment,” said 

Michigan coach Kurt Golder. 
“I knew we weren’t going to 
be a National Championship 
contender, but I knew we had 
the potential enough to make 
the Super Six, and we didn’t 
accomplish that.”

Despite 
the 
poor 
team 

performance 
Friday, 
seven 

gymnasts scored well enough 
on specific events to qualify for 

the NCAA Individual Finals, 
which took place later in the 
day on Saturday.

“(Friday) evening, they were 

disappointed, but I think they 
used it as motivation the next day,” 
Golder said. “It didn’t appear to me 
that anyone was moping around or 
anything, they appeared pretty 
excited about the opportunity that 
lied in front of them.”

Sophomore Dmitri Belanovski 

captured two All-America honors 
in the same day after finishing 
seventh in the All-Around and 
fifth on the floor. Fifth-year 
senior Colin Mahar — competing 
in his final meet for Michigan 
— tied third on the rings to also 
garner All-America honors.

But 
the 
most 
notable 

performance was by freshman 
Anthony McCallum. Competing 
at 
his 
first-ever 
NCAA 

Championship, McCallum scored 
a 15.550 on the vault, taking home 

an 
individual 

national 
title 

in that event 
by 
0.200 

points. 
The 

championship 
came 
two 

weeks 
after 

McCallum 
set an NCAA 

record while winning the vault 
title at the Big Ten Championships.

“It wasn’t a surprise to me,” 

Golder said. “He’s competed at 
the vault all year, and I thought he 
was being underscored all year. 
But at the Big Tens and NCAAs, 
he was getting more of the scores 
he deserved.”

The 2016 season will go down 

as a disappointment in Golder’s 
mind, who is just two years 
removed 
from 
back-to-back 

national titles. But, much like the 
rest of the season, disappointing 
team results were mixed with 
stellar individual performances.

“I thought he was 
being underscored 

all year.”

Two earn All-America honors

Artz, Brown, 

Chiarelli compete 
as individuals in 

final meet of season

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

To end a season in which the 

Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team hoped to contend for the 
national title, just three members 
of the team traveled to Fort 
Worth, Texas, for the NCAA 
Championships this weekend. But 
out of those three, two returned to 
Ann Arbor with second-team All-
American honors.

Junior 
Nicole 
Artz 
and 

sophomore 
Brianna 
Brown 

both advanced to the NCAA 
Championships 
for 
the 
all-

around, 
while 
junior 
Talia 

Chiarelli qualified for the meet 
on floor. With the tournament 

broken up into two sessions — 
one in the afternoon and one 
in the evening — the team was 
split as both Chiarelli and Artz 
were placed in the afternoon 
session and Brown was placed 
in the evening. Since the entire 
Michigan team didn’t make 
the championships, all three 
Wolverines were separated to 
compete as individuals among 
other teams.

Artz 
kicked 
off 
the 

tournament for the Wolverines 
with a rotation on the uneven 
bars. 
Surrounded 
by 
an 

unfamiliar team at a high-stakes 
competition, she was in an 
uncomfortable situation — until 
she looked to the uneven bars.

At a different event, Chiarelli 

left her makeshift team for its 
first rotation to cheer on Artz. 
Just like at Crisler, she was able 
to help prep her teammate for 
the event. And while the whole 
team wasn’t there, Chiarelli’s 
presence was enough to keep 

Artz calm for the event. Artz 
received a 9.8125 to start the 
day.

However, it was Artz’s floor 

routine that secured her All-
America honors for the third 
straight season. She scored a 
9.875 for the event, tying for 
sixth, which earned her a second 
team 
All-American 
honor. 

She now has a total of six All-
American honors.

Despite Artz’s awards and 

performances, that wasn’t the 
highlight of her time in Fort 
Worth.

“Honestly, I was most excited 

about Talia’s floor routine,” Artz 
said. “She decided to add a full-
in, and it was just really cool 
for her to go out there and nail 
something that big.”

Chiarelli, who qualified to 

perform her floor routine at 
the championships, capitalized 
on the fact that her routine 
wouldn’t affect a team score. 
Double Arabians and full-ins are 

both E-level passes, and only one 
is needed to fulfill the difficulty 
for collegiate gymnastics.

With no team stakes on 

the line, Chiarelli decided to 
perform both.

“We had toyed around with 

both of the passes and laughed 
about it at the beginning of 
the 
season,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Bev Plocki. “If she were 
competing in the Olympics and 
wanted to challenge Simone 
Biles or something, then she 
would do it. With these stakes, 
it 
was 
a 
once-in-a-lifetime 

opportunity, and I give her a lot 
of credit for doing it.”

Chiarelli under-rotated her 

full-in and took a step forward 
on the landing. She ended her 
season on floor with a 9.7125, 
an appropriate score for the 
difficulty of her routine.

Brown, who competed in the 

evening session, also claimed 
All-American 
honors 
despite 

lacking any presence from her 
teammates. Artz and Chiarelli 
— who had already finished 
competing — had to watch from 
the stands.

Despite 
competing 
alone, 

Brown still managed to hit all 
four routines. After securing a 
9.800 on bars, she had a solid 
routine on beam that resulted 
in 9.850, her best score of the 
night.

“Before my beam routine, 

I was feeling pretty nervous 
because beam is the place where 
I always get ahead of myself,” 
Brown said. “I looked to the 
stands, saw my beam coach and 
she told me I had it, and I just 
knew I could do it. I probably did 
one of the best beam routines 
I’ve done all year.”

With Chiarelli’s impressive 

performance 
on 
floor, 
and 

Brown and Artz walking away 
with additional All-American 
honors, they’re optimistic for 
the 2016-17 season. They also 
have high hopes that next time, 
they’ll be competing as a team 
rather than as individuals.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO
‘M’ wins CWPA title

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

It has been a short road back 

to prominence for the Michigan 
water polo team. After earning 
a share of the regular-season 
CWPA Championship a year 
ago 
under 
then-first 
year 

coach Marcelo Leonardi, the 
sixth-ranked Wolverines have 
eclipsed the marks set by last 
year’s squad. Michigan (7-0 
CWPA, 26-6 overall) reached 
the 25-win mark for the first 
time since 2011 with wins over 
Bucknell, No. 21 Hartwick, 
George Washington and Brown, 
going undefeated in conference 
play 
to 
earn 
the 
CWPA 

Championship outright.

But, the turnaround has come 

as no surprise to those in the 
program. Leonardi attributes 
this to three major points.

“(First), I was able to bring 

a quality freshman class and 
a transfer (to the team) that 
immediately 
impacted 
our 

program,” 
Leonardi 
said. 

“(Secondly), going through my 
first year being able to teach 
everything in terms of our 
system and play (has helped). 
Also, the leadership, in terms of 
our senior leadership this year, 
being able to establish a culture 
(has been) instrumental.”

One 
of 
those 
seniors, 

attacker Ali Thomason, has 
been especially impressive for 

the Wolverines this season. 
Her talent was on display this 
weekend. Sunday, in Michigan’s 
18-3 win over Brown, Thomason 
scored five goals, had three 
assists and added three steals.

The 
senior’s 
performance 

added on to an already impressive 
resume this season. Thomason 
has won the CWPA Player of the 
Week award twice and leads the 
Wolverines with 81 goals.

“I think she’s probably the 

best player in our conference, 
athletic-wise,” Leonardi said. 
“In terms of (being) a leader in 
and out of the 
water, 
and 

how 
humble 

she is in terms 
of all of the 
accolades 
she 
will 
be 

(garnering). 
It’s easy when 
the 
hardest 

worker 
on 

your team is 
one of the best 
players on the team.”

Though Thomason is the 

leading goal scorer on the team, 
she is often helped by sophomore 
attacker 
Caroline 
Anderson’s 

prominent passing abilities.

Anderson surpassed her own 

single-season assists record by 
recording her 57th of the year 
Saturday in the Wolverines’ 16-4 
win over Bucknell.

“She’s sharpening up her skills 

by her accuracy,” Leonardi said. 
“In terms of her reads, I think 
she’s understanding the plays 
now a little more systematically. 
(She’s) understanding where her 
options are. If her first option’s 
not there, where are her second 
and third options.”

Michigan now has a 12-day 

break 
before 
it 
travels 
to 

Cambridge, 
Mass., 
for 
the 

CWPA 
Championships. 
And 

though it has had great success 
this season, the conference 
tournament has tripped up the 
Wolverines in the past.

“We need to 

see who we’re 
going to play, 
not only in the 
first 
round, 

but later on in 
terms of who 
our semifinal 
matchup 
would 
be 

as 
well,” 

Leonardi said.

Michigan 

will need to win just three 
games in order to win the CWPA 
Tournament. If it is able to do 
that, the Wolverines will move 
on to the NCAA Championships, 
something they haven’t done 
since the 2009-10 season.

But if the quick turnaround 

under Leonardi is any indication, 
it will be no surprise if the 
Wolverines are able to prove 
themselves on yet another level.

“The leadership 

... (has been) 

able to establish 

a culture.”
Michigan falls to Penn State

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

For five minutes Sunday, the 

Michigan women’s lacrosse team 
got the start it wanted in the 
Wolverines’ 
search 
for 

their 
first 

conference win of the season.

Michigan jumped to a 2-1 lead 

with goals from junior attacker 
Jess 
Angerman 
and 
junior 

midfielder Kim Coughlan, the 
Wolverines (0-3 Big Ten, 6-9 
overall) looked like they were 
going to be locked into a back-and-
forth contest with the Nittany 
Lions.

However, 
the 
next 
Penn 

State goal sparked a 7-0 scoring 
run, crushing any momentum 
Michigan may have gained from 
their early offensive success.

That run proved to be too much 

to overcome, as the Wolverines fell 
to Penn State, 13-8.

“We’ve got to work on not 

getting in that hole,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Ulehla. “We’ve 
got to work on our transition and 
really being able to get the ball, 
under a lot of pressure, up the 
field.”

Despite the Nittany Lions’ large 

lead, the Wolverines made a push 

to close the gap before halftime, 
scoring two goals with less than 
five minutes before the break. 
Penn State (2-1, 10-4) quickly 
countered with two goals of its 
own, including a goal on a free 
position shot by attacker Madison 
Carter with 15 seconds remaining 
in the half, effectively canceling 
out the Michigan goals.

Carter was the high scorer 

for the Nittany Lions on Sunday, 
and the Michigan defense had no 
answer for her throughout the 
first half, as she notched all four of 
her goals before the break.

“In the first half we took too 

many chances like trying to 
intercept, trying to double team 
and stay on the double when we 
didn’t need to,” Ulehla said. “At 
halftime I just said trust your 
teammates and trust the defense 
and the goalie. Let them shoot 
from far out, let them shoot with 
a good solid defensive stance, 
and then our goalies will come 
up with the save which ended up 
happening.”

Though the Wolverines faced 

a 10-4 deficit coming out of the 
locker room, they didn’t roll over. 
Michigan managed to outscore 
Penn State 4-3 in the second half.

Three straight goals out of the 

half brought Michigan to within 

three with nearly 23 minutes 
left to play. But the Wolverines 
couldn’t keep that scoring pace 
going, scoring only once more the 
rest of the game.

Coughlan did her part, tallying 

two more goals in the second half. 
Despite Michigan being a player 
down, for Coughlan’s second goal 
of the half, she curled all the way 
across the front of the net before 
firing from the right side of the 
goal to slot it past the Penn State 
goaltender .

“There were some open lanes 

there,” Coughlan said. “Our girls 
on offense were moving a lot, 
going through for each other, and 
it caused a lot of open lanes.”

Added 
Ulehla: 
“You 
know 

when she gets going she’s very 
difficult to stop, she just goes 
north-south, and it’s like a bull in 
a china shop and she’s got a great 
shot. She finishes, she does a great 
job of really being disciplined and 
deceptive and finishes it really 
hard. Even if you put a great 
defender on her and you send 
help, they’ve got to time it right 
and they’ve got to make sure they 
don’t foul.”

But for the Wolverines, it will 

take more than a good start and 
individual performances to secure 
the team’s first Big Ten victory.

Engelmann grounded out, but 
drove in a run in the process. The 
inning ended when freshman 
second baseman Ako Thomas 
struck out looking.

“(Nebraska) 
got 
some 

momentum with a two-out RBI,” 
Bakich said, referencing the top of 
the sixth. “For our guys to come 
back and put up a two-spot is a 
great sign for the way our team 
stayed connected with each other.”

But it was the seventh frame 

where Michigan sealed the contest.

Once again, Bruder came up 

to bat, this time with Wenson on 
first and Benedetti on third with 
two outs. Bruder hit an RBI single 
to extend the Wolverines’ lead 
to 4-1. He finished Sunday with 
four hits on four at-bats, two runs 
scored and two RBI.

Lugbauer had the hit of the 

inning as he doubled to left field, 
scoring both Bruder and Wenson.

and continued to befuddle the 
Buckeyes’ batters. Ohio State’s 
third baseman Anna Kirk struck 
out, pinch hitter Shelby McCombs 
did the same and Machovina 
grounded out to Romero.

Despite 
the 
sudden 
lead, 

Hutchins was still disappointed 
in her team’s overall sluggishness.

“I thought we could have 

given Megan a lot better energy,” 
Hutchins said. “That’s not fair 
to her, and that is not fair to the 
game of softball.”

Whether or not Betsa had 

her best defense backing her, 
it mattered little in the game’s 
final frame. Throwing hard and 
in control of the strike zone, 
Betsa fanned the Buckeyes’ two 
best hitters, Bayne and Prantl, 
giving Michigan a laborious and 
important victory over its rivals, 
who entered the weekend in first 
place in the conference.
