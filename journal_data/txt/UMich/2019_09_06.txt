ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

On 
Thursday 
night, 
the 
Ann Arbor District Library, 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Michigan 
Community 
Scholars 
Program, 
offered 
a free viewing of the 2015 
documentary, “The Hunting 
Ground,” which depicts sexual 
violence on college campuses 
and the failures of universities 
to appropriately seek action 
against perpetrators of sexual 
assault. 
The viewing was followed 
by a panel discussion led 
by Elizabeth Seney, senior 
associate director of the U-M 
Office for Institutional Equity 
and 
Title 
IX 
Coordinator; 
Heather 
Colohan, 
program 
manager for the University’s 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and Awareness Center; and 
Kamaria Porter, U-M doctoral 
candidate and Title IX Project 
Lab manager.
The film discussed the shame 
survivors feel in speaking out, 
the actions by universities to 
minimize reports of sexual 

assault 
and 
the 
role 
star 
atheletes have played in sexual 
assault allegations.
Because the film was made 
in 2015, Seney discussed the 
changes and lack thereof she has 

seen in the culture surrounding 
sexual 
misconduct. 
Seney 
said while there has been an 
increase in reporting incidents 
of sexual assault, that does 
not necessarily correlate with 

an increase in action taken 
against perpetrators because 
it is dependent on the outcome 
desired by the person reporting 
the allegation.

As students arrive back on 
campus, some in the University 
of Michigan community are 
once 
again 
calling 
on 
the 
University to sever ties with real 
estate developer Stephen M. 
Ross — the largest donor in the 
University’s history — following 
the controversy surrounding a 
re-election fundraiser he held 
for President Donald Trump in 
early August. 
When 
reports 
of 
the 
fundraiser broke, Ross’s name 
trended on Twitter nationwide, 
with many calling for boycotts 
of SoulCycle and Equinox, two 
luxury gym companies owned by 
Ross. Soon after, the companies 
released statements saying they 
did not support the fundraiser 
and are not affiliated with Ross’s 
political contributions.

This summer, recent LSA 
graduate Carly Marten was 
awarded 
the 
prestigious 
Wallenberg 
Fellowship 
to 
pursue a research project in 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. 
The award offers $25,000 
to a graduating senior who is 
interested in public service 
to conduct a year-long, self-
designed 
research 
project 
abroad. 
Henry 
Dyson, 
director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
National 
Scholarships and Fellowships 
at the University of Michigan, 
said the fellowship attracts 
students with a willingness to 
take risks and strong interest in 
public service. 
“On the one hand, (they 
need) 
an 
entrepreneurial 
spirit,” Dyson said.

New LSA Dean Anne Curzan 
welcomed 
students 
back 
to 
campus with a pop-up event 
Thursday outside of Angell Hall 
to introduce herself to students. 
LSA representatives encouraged 
students walking by to chat 
with the dean and enjoy snacks 
and cornhole games during the 
event. 
LSA Communications Director 
Tamra 
Talmadge-Anderson 
credited the dean for having come 
up with the idea.
“When we sat down and met 
with (Curzan) before she became 
dean, she said ‘It is so important 
to me that I connect with students, 
and I want to connect with them in 
ways that are fun and meaningful 
and give them the opportunity to 
talk with me,’” Talmadge-Anderson 

said.
According to Curzan, this is 
the first time the college has done 
this kind of spontaneous event to 
connect with students. The dean 
explained how, as she was planning 
her meetings at the beginning of the 
semester, she also wanted to hold an 
event to welcome undergraduates 
to LSA. Curzan worked with her 
team to plan the event three weeks 
ago, stressing the importance of 
play in an individual’s well-being 
as well as the importance of the 
connections between University 
faculty and students.
“It’s really important to me that 
LSA be a place where students 
feel like they can explore, find the 
subjects that they love to study, 
feel connected to faculty and other 
mentors on campus and then 
connect that education to whatever 
they want the next chapter to be,” 
Curzan said.

Talmadge-Anderson explained 
how the event was designed to be 
a pop-up event and the department 
used 
social 
media 
to 
spread 
awareness of the event. The day 
before, the LSA Twitter page teased 
the event with the hint of a “special 
guest.” The day of the event, Curzan 
sent out an email sharing her vision 
for LSA and inviting students to join 
her that evening.
Before becoming dean on Sept. 
1, Curzan was an associate dean 
for the humanities as well as a 
professor of linguistics, education 
and English. She received a 
master’s degree and Ph.D. from the 
University in English Language 
and 
Literature 
and 
appears 
regularly on Michigan Radio’s 
segment “That’s What They Say” 
about the English language. The 
dean explained how her work as a 
professor influences how she views 
her new position. 

“We are as good as the people in 
the college, and so my job is to make 
sure that everybody can thrive,” 
Curzan said. “We’re gonna try to 
make sure that this is a place where 
students can enjoy learning … 
because that’s how you get the best 
education.”
LSA sophomore Jasmine Glover 
was passing by when she saw the 
crowds. She spoke with the dean, 
who asked her about how her 
classes were going and told her to 
explore her interests and passions 
before committing to a major. 
Glover expressed appreciation for 
the opportunity.
“She seems very enthusiastic 
about what she’s doing and really 
wants to help people,” Glover said. 
“It was really nice that she decided 
to do this and decided to come 
out and interact with us. That’s 
something I don’t typically see.”

ACLU calls for 
change to ‘U’
policies on
misconduct

Civil rights organization takes issue 
with cross-examiniation protocol

The American Civil Liberties 
Union of Michigan and the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
Women’s Rights Project released 
a letter to the University of 
Michigan Thursday morning 
calling on the administration 
to change its interim student 
sexual misconduct policy.
The investigative resolution 
pathway of the policy has 
students who file a sexual 
misconduct complaint undergo 
an in-person hearing and cross-
examination. The interim policy 
was implemented on Jan. 9 
due to a Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruling. 
Though the outcome of the 
Sixth Circuit’s ruling allows 
students 
to 
directly 
cross-
examine their accuser, it does not 
ban the employment of personal 
advisers — like attorneys — to 
conduct the procedure. It was 
the University that decided 
students alone must complete 
their own cross-examinations.
According to Bonsitu Kitaba, 
deputy legal director at the 
ACLU of Michigan, the letter 
was written as a follow-up 
to the University after they 
rejected the ACLU’s request for 
a meeting. The meeting would 
have been for the purpose of 
further discussing the interim 

policy with administrators and 
students. 
In the letter, the ACLU 
stressed how a policy that 
forces 
those 
accused 
of 
sexual assault or harassment 
to personally question their 
accuser could result in fewer 
sexual misconduct complaints, 
re-traumatization of those who 
made complaints and a hostile 
campus environment. 
The letter also urged the 
University to establish a new 
policy that better complies with 
Title IX and due process rights 
by having cross-examinations 
conducted by those who have 
legal training. 
Kitaba further emphasized 
the issue of students not having 
the option to employ a personal 
adviser for cross-examination. 
“It’s especially concerning 
because it prohibits ... the 
respondent’s 
or 
claimant’s 
adviser or representative from 
doing the cross-examination 
and actually requires that the 
students conduct it themselves,” 
Kitaba said. “It’s important to 
note that due process rights are 
vital to Title IX proceedings to 
ensure fairness for both parties, 
but the way the University has 
chosen to go about it completely 
undermines the Title IX process, 
as well as the safety and security 
of students on campus.”

Relationship Remix, a two-
hour workshop required for 
all 
freshmen 
and 
transfer 
students, got a makeover for the 
2019-2020 school year.
Previously led by student 
volunteers, the program instead 
hired 20 students this academic 
year as workshop facilitators. 
The 
program 
also 
updated 
some of the language used in its 
curriculum.
Relationship 
Remix 
is 
a 
program partnership between 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center, 
Wolverine Wellness and First 
Year Experience. FYE Program 
Manager Danielle Dros wrote 
in an email to The Daily that the 
core curriculum of Relationship 
Remix continues to engage 
students in conversations about 
the 
importance 
of 
healthy 
relationships in all parts of 
their lives.
“As we do every year, we 
have updated portions of the 
Relationship Remix workshop 
with 
new 
activities 
with 

student 
feedback 
helping 
shape the workshop, as well 
as 
staying 
up-to-date 
with 
the 
latest 
developments 
in 
the changing field of sexual 
violence 
prevention 
and 
healthy relationships work,” 
Dros wrote.
Nursing junior Ayla Raye-
Leonard 
began 
facilitating 
Relationship 
Remix 
as 
a 
sophomore. 
She 
said 
she 
noticed positive changes to the 
program curriculum this year.
“(Relationship Remix) totally 
revamped the script,” Raye-
Leonard said. “They added in 
a lot more LGBTQ-friendly 
language, and the dental dam 
section is totally new, which is 
super cool and inclusive.”
LSA 
freshman 
Jackson 
Strause 
participated 
in 
a 
Relationship 
Remix 
session 
Thursday evening. He said the 
program emphasized personal 
values while he expected it to 
include more aspects of sexual 
education.
“Compared to a lot of other 
health classes I’ve had, the 
focus was shifted dramatically 
from more sexual related stuff 

to more identity and values,” 
Strause said.

The 
20 
paid 
program 
facilitator 
positions 
now 
offered by Relationship Remix 
last for the duration of the 
workshop season.
“This 
year, 
our 
student 
facilitators 
will 
be 
staff, 
where before we had student 
volunteers,” Dros wrote. “This 
means we’ve got a strong core 
team that can really focus 
on the program, and we can 
recruit great students earlier, 
with 
additional 
training 
and support throughout the 
workshop season.”
In 
previous 
years, 
Relationship Remix consisted 
of about 80 volunteers. Raye-
Leonard 
said 
the 
smaller 
group 
allows 
facilitators 
to 
become 
more 
closely 
acquainted and comfortable 
working with each other.
“Now it’s just 20 people, 
and so it’s such a small group,” 
Raye-Leonard said. “It’s so 
nice, and you know everyone’s 
name and you can talk to them. 
During training, we do a lot of 
team building and continuing 
(education) on different social 
issues … which was super 
nice, because you could work 
with folks on a more intimate 
level.”
Strause said he thought 
the instructors who led his 
session were very friendly to 
the entire workshop.

“(The 
instructors) 
came 
around and checked up on all of 
us during the group sessions,” 
Strause said. “They were good 
instructors. They seemed to 
be enjoying what they were 
doing and they were really 
passionate.”
Relationship 
Remix 
also 
added a graduate coordinator 
position 
that 
supports 
the 
program 
throughout 
the 
academic year.
Students 
interested 
in 
becoming 
a 
Relationship 
Remix facilitator applied for 
the position in the spring of 
2019, according to Dros. Those 
chosen 
students 
underwent 
an 
in-person 
interview 
that 
included 
a 
facilitation 
demonstration by applicants. 
The 20 selected attended a 
training 
process 
the 
week 
prior to the start of the fall 
semester and began facilitating 
Relationship Remix sessions 
Sept. 4.
Relationship 
Remix 
looks 
forward 
to 
learning 
how 
students and facilitators will 
receive the changes that have 
been made for the 2019 season, 
Dros wrote.
“This 
will 
help 
inform 
changes 
for 
2020, 
as 
the 
program is always evolving,” 
Dros wrote. “We’ve already 
heard from some facilitators 
that they have appreciated 
having a tighter-knit group of 
colleagues to lean on and that 
they have enjoyed the updated 
training for 2019.”
This is LSA junior Caroline 
Shoopman’s first year as a 
Relationship Remix program 
facilitator. She said becoming 
a program facilitator this year 
showed her ways to be a better 
person.
“Relationship Remix is the 
perfect example of what U of 
M is like, just really socially 
inclusive,” Shoopman said. “I’m 
always adapting and trying to 
make sure everyone is seen and 
heard … The more I do these 
things, the more I want to hold 
myself accountable because I 
want to be the model for other 
people. So it’s cool to feel like 
you’re starting with yourself in 
the community and people will 
follow.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
Privatizing sexual health screenings will 
undoubtedly lower affordability and access to students 
who may or may not have personal insurance willing to 
cover the cost of the testing. This will further discourage 
students to get STI screened because they will likely have 
to pay some portion out-of-pocket, which is an added 
expense many cannot afford.”

University Health Service.

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look at one 
of this week’s stories. This week, LSA junior Ethan Sears wrote about 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and the intersection of football and family.

“Well, when I got on the beat I knew I wanted to do some kind of deep dive on 
Harbaugh, and like the default angle on him when he got hired, was a bunch of 
people wrote the story of ‘Oh, he grew up in Michigan and he has this family,’ 
but obviously if you have this family that’s full of coaches, you’re going to have 
an inherent conflict there. I kind of just wanted to dive into it, and then I found 
out that Jack [Harbaugh] had had a heart attack three years ago and realized 
that that was the angle to take,

Relationship Remix revamped

Program for freshmen undergoes changes, updates for 2019-2020 school year

BARBARA COLLINS
Daily Staff Reporter

They added in a 
lot more LGBTQ-
friendly language, 
and the dental 
dam section is 
totally new, which 
is super cool and 
inclusive.


In an email, University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
said 
the 
University 
does 
not 
let 
attorneys 
conduct 
cross-
examination for accessibility 
reasons. 
“It’s important to note, Doe 
v. Baum calls for a student 
or their advisor to conduct 
the 
cross-examination,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“Questioning 
by 
personal 
advisors - often attorneys - 
is not allowed at U-M out of 
concern that not all students 
would 
be 
able 
to 
afford 
counsel.”
However, Kitaba said if the 
University noticed access to a 
personal adviser was an issue 
for students, then there should 
be more administrative efforts 
in place to help students obtain 
representation. 
“If the school has identified 
that there is a need for students 
to have equal representation in 
these proceedings, then the 
school should offer appointed 
reps for students who are 
unable to hire their own 
attorney,” Kitaba said. “The 
alternative to then require 
that students do their own 
cross-examination 
because 
they can’t afford attorneys is 
just simply uncalled for and 
unnecessary.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Emma 
Sandberg 
is 
a 
founding 
member of former student 
group Jane Roe — the group 
that had contacted the ACLU 
of 
Michigan 
in 
February 
regarding 
the 
University’s 
interim Title IX policy. 
“I’m glad that the ACLU is 
stepping forward to make it 
very clear that the majority of 
people would feel that this is 
traumatizing and that this is 
a violation of civil rights and 
human rights,” Sandberg said. 
Sandberg said she feels 
it was irresponsible for the 
University to pursue a policy 
that makes students conduct 
cross-examinations directly.. 
“That is something that 
I 
consider 
to 
be 
cruel,” 
Sandberg 
said. 
“That 
is 
not something that is done 
in court. It astonishes me 
that administrators at the 
University somehow decided 
to make the policy this way. 
It’s unimaginable to me that 
they feel that this is the best 
solution.” 
Broekhuizen said moving 
forward, the University will 
continue efforts to develop the 
policy further. 
“We continue to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the interim 
policy through feedback from 
the 
student 
community,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“U-M 
also is working to develop an 
umbrella policy for students, 
faculty and staff and separate 
procedures 
for 
students 
and employees, all of which 
will undergo vetting by our 
community.”

“I mean that broadly in the 
sense of latching on to an idea. 
I think a lot of us have ideas, 
and we think ‘oh, somebody 
should do that.’ What I mean 
by entrepreneurial spirit is, ‘no 
really, somebody should do that 
— I should do that. What would 
it take to actually do that?’”
Marten, who is currently 
conducting 
research 
at 
a 
sexual assault clinic housed 
in Addis Ababa’s Menelik II 
Hospital, chose to investigate 
the legal barriers to justice for 
survivors of sexual violence for 
her Wallenberg proposal. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
she noted how this fellowship 
aligned 
closely 
with 
her 
interests because it allowed 
her to adapt her project in ways 
she may not have been able 
to with other scholarships or 
fellowships. 
“The policy that I’ve had 
for myself is just basically to 
say ‘yes’ to anything that is 
offered to me,” Marten said. 
“It’s been such an honor to have 
that flexibility, and I’ve also 
been able to really follow my 

curiosity. So, when my research 
strayed a little bit from our 
original proposal, I felt more 
at liberty to follow that path 
than maybe if I had tried to do 
a Fulbright.”
Marten spent the summer 
of 2018 in Addis Ababa doing 
Fulbright research in the same 
field and chose to return to 
her project after receiving the 
Wallenberg Fellowship. Dyson 
said even though Marten’s 
research project was detailed 
and planned out well before 
the 
fellowship’s 
application 
deadline, her proposal had 
to be tweaked in order to 
fit 
specifically 
with 
the 
Wallenberg mission. 
“The key to this is that 
people should be applying to 
multiple scholarships, but they 
can’t just copy and paste from 
one opportunity to the other,” 
Dyson said. “You really have to 
understand (the scholarship). 
That was most of the work we 
did with Carly, it was ‘how do 
we take an existing Fulbright 
proposal and make this into a 
Wallenberg proposal that really 
understands 
Wallenberg’s 
story?’”
The Wallenberg Fellowship 
and accompanying Wallenberg 

Medal are named after Raoul 
Wallenberg, a University alum 
and Swedish diplomat who 
spent much of his adult life 
in Budapest working to save 
the last remaining Hungarian 
Jews from persecution during 
World War II. Wallenberg 
created a system of safe-houses 
in Budapest and distributed 
falsified Swedish visas and 
passports to Jews at risk of 
being sent to the concentration 
camps of Eastern Europe. In 
early 1945, as the war drew to a 
close, Wallenberg was arrested 
by Soviet forces and died in 
Moscow’s 
Lubyanka 
Prison 
two years later. 
John Godfrey, assistant dean 
for 
international 
education 
at Rackham Graduate School 
and chair of the Wallenberg 
Committee, said Wallenberg’s 
legacy as a humanitarian and 
University alum pushed him to 
establish a fellowship dedicated 
to serving the public good. 
“In Europe, he is recognized 
as being one of the great heroes 
of the Second World War,” 
Godfrey said. “This fellowship 
was established to bring his 
examples to the attention of 
our students, and to inspire 
them, and to encourage them to 

embrace his view of life, which 
was to be adventuresome, to 
be willing to go out and see the 
world close up, to experience 
communities 
where 
people 
live, to not be intimidated 
by language barriers but to 
overcome them and to embrace 
humane values in the best and 
broadest sense.”
Marten, who is working 
alongside a team of researchers 
in the clinic, said she hoped her 
research would both contribute 
meaningfully to the academic 
field and help survivors of 
sexual assault in Ethiopia seek 
out some form of justice. She 
noted how the established body 
of work in her area of study 
often does not include data 
from Ethiopia, making it an 
important place to conduct this 
research. 
“We want to be able to 
contribute to the literature 
in this field,” Marten said. 
“There’s a lot of sexual violence 
literature when you look at the 
larger international scope, but 
if you stick to Ethiopia, the 
literature, especially coming 
out of medical clinic spaces, 
is pretty minimal. We want 
to be able to contribute to that 
research community.”

“The 
reasons 
for 
actions 
being taken depends on a couple 
different things, and one is 
what — and the word we use in 
the policy is — proclaiment or 
claimant, what they want to see 
happen, and sometimes that’s 
an investigation and sometimes 
that’s an adaptable resolution 
and sometimes that’s no action 
from the University,” Seney said. 
LSA freshman Aaron Lev is 
part of the Michigan Community 
Scholars Program and attended 
the event as a requirement for 
his program. Lev said based on 
the panel discussion, he does 
not think there has been much 
improvement in the handling of 
sexual assault claims since the 
movie came out in 2015.
“It didn’t seem like that much 
has really changed since the 
movie happened,” Lev said. 
“That was my big takeaway.”
Colohan 
mentioned 
the 
tools in place to educate first-
year 
students 
about 
sexual 
misconduct, including an online 
course about sexual assault, 
which students complete prior 
to arriving on campus, and the 
mandatory workshops known as 
Relationship Remix and Change 
it Up, which are required for 
first-year 
students 
to 
learn 
about 
consent 
and 
healthy 
relationships.
LSA freshman Grace Jung, 
said 
the 
panel 
discussion 
enlightened her about resources 
available on campus to report 
assault, such as SAPAC. 
“One thing I took away was 
the amount of research that 
goes into the policy behind 
sexual assault with SAPAC and 
the 
different 
organizations,” 
Jung said. “If something were 
to happen within my four years 
here, I hope to see Michigan 
respond in a supportive way and 
in a way that leads the victim to 
the justice they want, need and 
deserve.”
LSA 
freshman 
Sukainah 
Khan had seen the documentary 
multiple times, and felt the 
panel 
discussion 
did 
not 
clarify whether the University 
effectively addresses assault.
“When we were listening to 
the responses (of panelists), some 
of it was a little dissatisfying,” 
Kahn said. “A lot of the answers 
were good answers, and I know 
they (the University) do have 
resources, but they didn’t really 
address 
the 
accessibility 
to 
them …Yes, there are measures 
to take, but whether or not they 
are being effective … It’s just 
questions to ask. There’s always 

Amid growing backlash, 
Ross defended his fundraiser 
to 
the 
Miami 
Herald, 
explaining he hoped to engage 
with political leaders on job 
creation and the economy 
while calling himself “an 
outspoken 
champion” 
of 
various social issues.
Within 
the 
University 
community, opinions on the 
matter were divided. Some 
expressed it would be wrong 
for the University to disavow 
Ross based on his politics, 
while others believed Ross’s 
association with Trump did 
not align with the University’s 
values. 
Scott DeRue, dean of the 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business, 
sent an email to the Business 
School 
community 
after 
the news broke in August, 
emphasizing the school did 
not endorse the fundraiser. 
Yet 
some 
community 
members felt the school’s 
response 
was 
inadequate, 
including 
Business 
alum 
Kumar Rao, who started an 
alumni open letter — which 
has about 600 signatures at 
time of publication — asking 
the 
University 
remove 
Ross’s name from buildings 
campuswide. 
Last week, another alum 
created a Change.org petition 
with the same demand, this 
time open for anyone to 
sign. Created by University 
alum Logan Drummond, the 
petition has more than 200 
signatures as of Wednesday 
night.
Drummond explained he 

created this petition because 
he believes Ross’s support of 
Trump may impact student 
well-being on campus. 
“Particularly 
for 
marginalized 
students 
at 
U-M, walking around and 
seeing the Ross name and 
knowing 
its 
associations 
with Trump now, it’d make 
them 
feel 
less 
welcome,” 
Drummond said. 
When asked about Rao’s 
open letter in early August, 
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald told The Daily 
all donors’ political views 
are their own. In response 
to 
Drummond’s 
petition, 
Fitzgerald 
wrote 
the 
University’s stance on the 
issue remains unchanged. 
“Regarding calls to remove 
Stephen Ross’s name from the 
Ross School of Business: We 
will not do that,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “We don’t exclude 
or include people from our 
university community based 
on their political views.”
Like Rao, Drummond said 
he 
finds 
the 
University’s 
response lacking. 
“I see this petition as 
working in conjunction with 
(the 
alumni 
open 
letter) 
to increase the pressure,” 
Drummond 
said. 
“I 
hope 
to get a snowball rolling to 
increase the effects of both.”
The 
recent 
controversy 
surrounding Ross’s support 
of Trump continues a series 
of 
incidents 
concerning 
free speech on campus, a 
debate playing out on college 
campuses 
nationwide. 
In 
March, 
Trump 
signed 
an 
executive order to protect 
free speech at universities 
in response to some who 

believe conservative views 
are suppressed. 
When contacted in early 
August, LSA senior Maria 
Muzaurieta wrote on behalf 
of the University chapter 
of College Republicans the 
situation has led to unfair 
“slander” 
against 
Ross. 
College 
Republicans 
did 
not respond to requests for 
updated comment by time of 
publication. 
“Stephen 
Ross 
is 
a 
respectable and charitable 
Republican 
who 
has 
the 
right to affiliate with and 
fundraise for our nation’s 
president, Donald Trump,” 
Muzaurieta 
wrote. 
“We 
respect 
the 
rights 
of 
celebrities and businessmen 
alike 
to 
associate 
with 
whichever political figures 
they support and we believe 
that this extends to Stephen 
Ross and President Trump.”
In response to those who 
disagree with renaming the 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business, 
Drummond emphasized he 
does not believe the issue is 
a violation of free speech. He 
said he sees Ross’s support 
of Trump as an endorsement 
of Trump’s rhetoric, which 
Drummond labeled as hate 
speech that should not be 
protected. 
Drummond 
questioned 
whether 
the 
University’s 
donors have too much of an 
influence 
over 
University 
policy. 
“Doesn’t this limit the free 
speech of students in a way?” 
Drummond said. “It makes 
our well-being lesser than 
that of wealthy donors.” 
On behalf of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 

Public Policy junior Camille 
Mancuso 
connected 
the 
situation to an issue of values 
instead of free speech. 
“University building names 
and donors are a reflection of 
the school’s values,” Mancuso 
wrote in an email to The Daily. 
“Stephen Ross’s support of 
Trump 
reflects 
values 
of 
racism and white supremacy. 
These are not the values that 
we hold as an organization, 
as individuals or as a school 
community.”
In 
March 
2018, 
the 
University’s Board of Regents 
voted unanimously to rename 
the former C.C. Little Building 
and the Winchell House in 
West Quad following months 
of 
advocacy. 
University 
administration decided both 
cases met the “heavy burden” 
required for building name 
changes.
As a University professor 
in the late 1800s, Winchell 
wrote racist academic papers 
maintaining 
white 
people 
were biologically superior to 
other groups. While president 
of the University in the early 
1900s, Little was a supporter 
of the eugenics movement, the 
anti-immigration movement 
and later the tobacco industry. 
Notably, 
the 
renamings 
were 
reviewed 
by 
the 
President’s 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
History. 
Conversely, 
the 
recent calls to rename the 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business 
involve a figure associated 
with the University who is 
still actively contributing to 
the University. 
In the past, there have also 
been other debates on free 
speech related to speakers 

on campus. In 2013, author 
Alice Walker was uninvited 
from speaking at the Center 
for Education of Women’s 
anniversary event, as her 
work included criticism of 
Israel regarding the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. A letter 
allegedly from Walker’s agent 
claimed Walker’s invitation 
was rescinded after sponsors 
of the event threatened to 
withdraw funding, a claim 
the center has denied. 
The issue of free speech 
was at the forefront again in 
2017, when many community 
members 
protested 
after 
the 
University 
considered 
allowing white supremacist 
Richard Spencer to speak 
on campus. The University 
ultimately decided not to host 
Spencer as the administration 
decided safety of attendees 
could not be guaranteed. 
However, those like Rao 
and Drummond who wish 
for the Business School to be 
renamed may face difficulty 
in achieving their goals. 
Despite 
the 
University’s 
firm stance on the issue and 
waning campus interest in 
the controversy, Drummond 
said he plans to continue 
advocating 
for 
the 
name 
change. Drummond explained 
his next steps are to reach out 
to other University donors for 
support. 
“I think putting pressure 
on U-M through them, I 
think would be the most 
effective way besides student 
voices 
and 
petitions,” 
Drummond said. “Because 
unfortunately, the financial 
aspect of an issue influences 
U-M more than moral issues 
sometimes.”

What we can learn from early-age feminism
I

n 
today’s 
world, 
the 
word 
“feminism” 
is 
further removed from 
its purpose than ever before. 
Jessa Crispin’s “Why I am 
Not a Feminist: A Feminist 
Manifesto,” 
accurately 
dismantles the definition of 
feminism today and mandates 
that the reader trace the 
origins 
of 
the 
feminist 
movement 
to 
identify 
at 
what point in the fight for 
gender equity we strayed 
off-course. Crispin writes, 
“Much 
of 
contemporary 
feminism uses the language 
of ‘power.’ Girls need to be 
‘empowered,’ 
‘girl 
power,’ 
etc.” 
And 
while 
scrolling 
past Instagram posts that 
aestheticize feminist ideals 
and 
undoubtedly 
evoke 
a 
facade of female solidarity, 
the reality is they’re just 
words. Words do not equate 
to action. Though liking and 
sharing 
stories 
on 
social 
media are excellent ways to 
educate, support one another 
and 
increase 
awareness, 
doing so does not inherently 
make you a feminist.
It’s 
especially 
important 
to 
recognize 
the 
social 
ramifications 
of 
being 
a 
“feminist” in the modern day. 
The 
societal 
understanding 
of 
feminism 
often 
wrongly 
associates it with completely 
radical ideas, such as women 
“hating” men or wanting to 
surpass and put down men. 
This negative rhetoric does 
not lend itself to progress. 
It’s unfortunate, because the 
feminist movement is a fight 
for equal rights and equal 
opportunity. 
Recently, 
the 
feminist 
agenda 
has 
been 
heavily 
rooted 
in 
singular 
acts that focus on individual 
encounters related to sexual 
assault, 
sexual 
harassment, 
sexist comments and jokes at 
the expense of women. 
Of 
course, 
these 
acts 
demand 
consequences 
and 
should not go unnoticed or be 
swept under the rug, because 
this 
action 
perpetuates 
patriarchal 
ideologies. 
That being said, it’s equally 
essential to not allow these 
issues to become the sole 
focus of feminism. 
As the late author Toni 
Morrison 
once 
brilliantly 
stated, “I tell my students, 
‘When you get these jobs that 
you have been so brilliantly 

trained for, just remember 
that your real job is that if 
you are free, you need to free 
somebody else. If you have 
some power, then your job is 
to empower somebody else.” 
Feminism is meant to facilitate 
a space in which women, men 
and non-binary people alike 
advocate for women to attain 
equal opportunity, equal pay 
and equal rights. Feminism 
is meant to reframe the way 
women are viewed in all 
fields, whether that be the 
arts, STEM or business, and 
in doing so, to discourage 
society from adhering to the 
gender 
norms 
established 
during the earliest periods of 
civilization. It’s important to 
stand up for women around 

the world, encourage women 
to pursue higher executive 
positions and support women 
in career-related endeavors, 
which, in its process, will 
change oppressive rhetoric.
Let’s take, for example, the 
start of the so-called “first-
wave 
feminist 
movement.” 
During this time, the feminist 
fight focused on suffrage. 
Fast-forward a hundred years 
and the feminist movement 
is 
heavily 
dominated 
by 
opinions 
and 
personal 
narratives, which have their 
time and place, but do not 
address the root causes of 
sexism. The problem with 
letting personal narratives 
dictate the conversation is 
that they are not sufficient 
on their own to elicit a strong 
response 
from 
the 
whole 
community. The ugly truth is 
that society is most tangibly 
influenced by numbers, data 
and statistics. The feminist 
movement appears fractured 
rather than a united front, 
as if each woman is pursuing 
her own agenda rather than 
looking at this as a societal 
issue.
A few years ago, one of the 

biggest feminine care product 
companies, Always, ran a 
Super Bowl ad as a part of 
their “Like A Girl” campaign. 
This ad featured young boys 
and girls who were asked 
what it meant to “run like a 
girl” or “fight like a girl.” This 
may seem trivial, however, 
I consider this a major step 
forward. 
It 
was 
beyond 
refreshing to see young girls 
reclaim what it means to do 
things “like a girl.” This ad 
started a dialogue in which 
adults 
and 
adolescents 
alike 
confronted 
a 
sexist 
concept and prompted a self-
reflection: When did we start 
using “like a girl” as an insult? 
Do I feed into this growing 
problem? This is what the 
feminist movement originally 
set out to do: mitigate gender 
biases by questioning their 
validity and reframe their 
role in society. 
I am a feminist. However, 
much like I refuse to be a 
“single-policy” voter, I refuse 
to be a “bandwagon” feminist. 
I refuse to be a feminist only 
when it is most convenient. I 
refuse to let feminism become 
just 
a 
women’s 
problem. 
It’s 2019, and it’s time we 
respect 
the 
trailblazers 
of our past and push for 
feminism to be a community 
initiative. It’s essential to 
realize the purpose of the 
“bra-burning feminists” of 
our past is not to inspire 
radical 
uprisings 
today. 
Rather, it is a call to action to 
confront and resolve gender 
discrimination. 
Protesting 
gender discrimination and 
injustice to women ranges 
from 
addressing 
day-to-
day 
microaggressions 
to 
tackling restrictive policies. 
Look around you, support 
on-campus 
advocacy 

and 
diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion initiatives, attend 
events produced by female-
run organizations and speak 
up to stand in solidarity 
with women. With the 2020 
election upon us, prioritize 
electing policymakers who 
have women’s health care and 
the gender pay gap as a part of 
their agenda. What we need 
right now is to smash the 
glass ceiling, not just crack it.

T

hree mass shootings 
received 
major 
media 
attention 
at 
the end of July and 
the 
beginning 
of 
August. 
On 
July 
28, in Gilroy, Calif., 
a 
terrorist 
killed 
three 
people 
and 
injured 13 others. 
On 
August 
3, 
in 
El 
Paso, 
Texas, 
another 
terrorist 
killed 
22 
people 
and 
injured 
24 
others. On August 
4, in Dayton, Ohio, a gunman 
killed 
nine 
people 
and 
injured 27 others. Though the 
first two terrorists were also 
motivated by racist ideology, 
the 
connection 
between 
these mass shooters, and an 
overwhelming 
number 
of 
mass shooters in general, is 
misogyny. 
While sexism involves sex 
discrimination in individual 
cases, misogyny is systemic 
sex discrimination wherein 
societal structures of power 
are built to inflict harm on 
women due to sexist beliefs 
and vice versa – sexist beliefs 
form 
to 
justify 
systemic 
injustice.
The 
shooter 
in 
Dayton 
was described as “hateful to 
women because they didn’t 
want to date him” and created 
a kill and rape list for women 
who rejected him. The El Paso 
terrorist often posted white 
supremacist content on the 
website 8chan, where many 
men are radicalized. And 
the Gilroy terrorist posted a 
recommendation for a neo-
Nazi 
manifesto 
— 
which 
is filled with misogynistic 
and racist ideology — on 
Instagram the day of the 
shooting. 
It doesn’t stop there. 
In 
2017, 
a 
man 
killed 
26 
people 
in 
Sutherland 
Springs, 
Texas. 
He 
had 
been convicted of domestic 
violence 
and 
repeatedly 
beat 
and 
threatened 
his 
first wife. The shooter at 
Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in 
2016 beat his wife while she 
was pregnant. The man who 
killed 17 students at Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School threatened, abused 
and stalked multiple women. 
The shooter at a yoga studio 
in Tallahassee, Fla., was a 
self-described 
misogynist 
and was arrested multiple 
times for assaulting young 
women. A man who shot his 
ex-fiancée and two others 
at a hospital in Chicago 
was 
repeatedly 
reported 
to authorities for multiple 
instances 
of 
domestic 
violence. To add to the ever-
growing 
list, 
one 
of 
the 

shooters of Columbine High 
School wrote about resenting 
women, blaming them for 
his 
romantic 
alienation. 
More than just 
an anecdote, this 
phenomenon 
was 
confirmed 
in 
an 
analysis 
by 
Everytown 
for 
Gun 
Safety, 
which found that 
“the majority of 
mass 
shootings” 
between 
2009 
and 2017 were “related to 
domestic or family violence.” 
According 
to 
experts 
studying control and fear, 
domestic violence is “often 
a way for male abusers to 
impose their view of the 
‘traditional’ 
gender 
roles 
… such ‘traditions’ in the 
United States were rooted 
in the idea of men having 
control over women.”

Shannon Watts, the founder 
of Moms Demand Action for 
Gun Sense in America, said, 
“Most mass shootings are 
rooted in domestic violence.”
Gun regulation is needed 
to end gun violence, and it is 
essential for gun regulation 
to include provisions that 
bar 
people 
who 
exhibit 
misogynistic tendencies — 
such as domestic violence or 
assault — from gaining access 
to guns. 
While 
it 
is 
true 
that 
federal law prohibits people 
convicted of certain cases 
of domestic violence from 
buying 
or 
owning 
guns, 
there are many loopholes 
that enable domestic abusers 
and 
virulent 
misogynists 
to obtain guns, including 
assault 
weapons. 
Also, 
federal law does not actually 
remove 
guns 
from 
such 
abusers because it does not 
lay out a removal procedure, 
so abusers who already have 
guns continue to own them. 
Notably, 
when 
the 
reauthorization 
for 
the 
Violence Against Women Act 
passed in the U.S. House of 
Representatives in April, the 
N.R.A. opposed it in the U.S. 
Senate because the VAWA 
has red-flag provisions that 
increase 
protections 
for 

victims of domestic violence 
and abuse. 
Obviously, 
the 
United 
States is not the only country 
with rampant misogyny and 
a patriarchy. Easy access to 
guns allows mass shooters 
and terrorists to carry out 
their plans, but misogyny, 
often paired with racism, 
anti-Semitism, Islamaphobia 
and 
xenophobia, 
is 
what 
radicalizes these men in the 
first place.
In the long history of 
mass shootings, a professed 
hatred of women is extremely 
prevalent. With the rise of 
the internet, recent mass 
shooters 
have 
identified 
as “incels,”or “involuntary 
celibates.” Incels form an 
online subculture on sites like 
Reddit and 4chan. These men 
declare generalized hatred 
toward all women for denying 
them sex and blame them for 
their own lack of romantic 
relationships. 
Incels 
also 
frequently fantasize about 
violence 
towards 
women 
in order to punish them for 
rejecting them and celebrate 
mass shooters with similar 
ideology.
The 
men 
who 
call 
themselves 
incels 
revere 
Elliot Rodger as the original 
incel-killer. One of Rodger’s 
followers called for an “Incel 
Rebellion” on Facebook before 
killing 
10 
and 
wounding 
14 
in 
Toronto. 
Rodger 
himself 
posted 
disturbing 
messages on Youtube before 
killing six people in 2014 
because he blamed female 
students at the University 
of California, Santa Barbara 
for his isolation. He wrote, 
“I’ve been forced to endure 
an existence of loneliness, 
rejection 
and 
unfulfilled 
desires, 
all 
because 
girls 
have never been attracted to 
me. … I will have my revenge 
against 
humanity. 
I 
will 
punish all of you for it.” 
Like 
Rodger, 
men 
who 
identify as incels feel entitled 
to women, their attention 
and their bodies. They do not 
view women as human beings 
who 
have 
autonomy 
over 
their decisions and bodies 
independent 
from 
men. 
Instead, they believe women 
exist to serve their needs, to 
quench their self-inflicted 
loneliness with sex, concern 
and love. And when these 
men, with their resentment 
and hatred of women, have 
access to guns, it is no wonder 
there is mass shooting after 
mass shooting.

n 2010, the United States 
Supreme 
Court 
held 
in 
Citizens United v. Federal 
Election Commission that it was 
unconstitutional for the federal 
government to impose any type of 
restriction on corporate spending 
for 
political 
communications, 
provided it is not directly in 
cooperation with a candidate or 
campaign. Nine years after the 
Supreme Court’s ruling, fervent 
opposition to the landmark decision 
has yet to subside. In fact, earlier 
this summer, Democrats in the U.S. 
Senate presented a constitutional 
amendment 
to 
overturn 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s 
decision 
in 
Citizens United. 
Why does the decision of 
Citizens 
United 
remain 
so 
controversial today? The most 
prevalent concern among the 
American electorate regarding 
the decision is the fear of 
corporations holding unfettered 
power and influence on elections. 
This would essentially dwarf the 
voice of the ordinary individual 
through super PACs or political 
action 
committees 
that 
have 
the ability to raise and spend 
unlimited funds to advocate for 
or against candidates publicly. 
However, this claim is naive 
and unsubstantiated. The true 
concern Citizens United presents 
is one regarding other means of 
corporate influence, particularly 
lobbying. 
Despite enormous backlash, 
the Supreme Court was certainly 
warranted in its decision. The 
First Amendment underscores 
the freedom of assembly, implying 
that the right to freedom of speech 
is guaranteed, even when citizens 
join together. Any attempt to 
curtail the independent political 
spending of any organization 
would violate this fundamental 
right. 
Many 
would 
agree 

that 
nonprofits 
like 
Planned 
Parenthood should be free to 
independently spend funds on 
advertisements. So what should 
limit other corporations such as 
Microsoft or Verizon?
Anyone 
skeptical 
of 
this 
argument should also take into 
account that studies have shown 
that PAC spending has little 
effect on vote shares and voter 
turnout. Additionally, research 
has 
signaled 
the 
possibility 
that money isn’t likely to decide 
election success, especially taking 
into account other factors such 
as incumbency and partisanship. 
In fact, three of the top five most 
funded super PACs of 2016 were in 
support of the candidate who did 
not win the presidential election.
After some deep digging, it is 
evident the relationship between 
PAC spending and elections is 
much more complex than initially 
thought. But before one takes a 
sigh of relief, a greater problem 
must be acknowledged: lobbying. 
Lobbying has long been seen 
as a disease afflicting American 
democracy. Public perception of 
lobbying is the belief that lobbyists 
intend to dominate policymaking 
through 
their 
persuasion 
of 
legislators. But in reality, lobbyists 
are much more intricately unified 
with legislators than many believe. 
It is no secret that legislators 
are extremely limited in their 
ability to pay their congressional 
staffers. As a result, congressional 
offices experience high turnover 
rates, with employees quick to 
accept opportunities to make 
more money elsewhere. As a 
result, staffers often have little 
experience or knowledge, leaving 
them 
heavily 
dependent 
on 
lobbyists to assemble the research 
necessary to develop their policies. 
As a result, lobbying can 
more accurately be described 

as a legislative subsidy, a term 
coined by University of Michigan 
professors Richard Hall and Alan 
Deardorff. A legislative subsidy 
can be defined as “a matching 
grant of costly policy information, 
political intelligence, and labor 
to the enterprises of strategically 
selected legislators.”
With 95 of the 100 highest-
spending lobbying organizations 
representing 
business, 
a 
large 
number 
of 
business 
representatives act as legislative 
subsidies. 
These 
business 
representatives 
often 
provide 
expertise on policy issues that 
affect them, playing a large role 
in the overall decision-making 
process 
of 
legislators. 
Public 
officials and certain industries, 
like that of education, remain 
outshined. Therefore, it is no 
surprise 
that 
companies 
can 
exert excessive influence over 
policymaking 
with 
business 
interests so highly represented. In 
fact, one study shows that business 
interests are disproportionately 
represented compared to the 
interests of the general public. 
With 
Citizens 
United 
still 
sparking discussion about the 
role of money in politics today, the 
American public should be aware 
that 
restricting 
independent 
corporate expenditures is not a 
solution to political corruption; 
business interests in lobbying are 
far more problematic. This issue 
has yet to be met with a realistic 
and tangible resolution and may 
well be just another inherent flaw 
of our nation’s capitalistic 
society. But for the sake of true 
democracy, we should not give 
up on finding ways to lessen 
the impact of wealthy special 
interests. 

The threat to our democracy is not Citizens United

What I’ve Been Listening To:
Rostam’s shining ‘Half-Light’

Sometime in early 2017, when 
re-shelving 
scores 
at 
the 
music 
library (my job at the time) I found a 
“21st-century songbook,” about the 
same size and shape as the copies of 
the “Great American Songbook” that 
were a few shelves away. It had piano 
reductions, chords and the fully noted 
melodies for pop songs from 2000-2011. 
It was odd to see these songs 
represented this way. Like many other 
people my age, I experienced these 
songs as sound first, and I didn’t have 
to seek them out — I heard them on 
tinny school bus speakers, on phone 
speakers, in the background at grocery 
stores. They seemed too ubiquitous to 
be boiled down into notes on a page.
Is it even possible to reduce most 
music in the 21st century to notation? 
Increasingly, the role of the producer 
isn’t to realize a composition or even 
to create something from nothing, but 
to act like a sort of sonic beachcomber, 
collecting bits and pieces of sound from 
everywhere, layering and warping 
them like a collage artist. With the 
dissolution of rigid genre boundaries 
comes a heady, ceiling-less world of 
sonic possibility.
The producer and singer-songwriter 
Rostam Batmanglij (who performs 
and records under his first name) is a 
producer who leaves the seams from 
this process audible, and the result is 
disarming and totally unique. His 2017 
album “Half-Light” has this oddly 
half-finished quality to it, like all the 
screws haven’t been tightened and the 
levels haven’t been quite adjusted all 
the way. Most of these songs are about 
a minute too long but it doesn’t bother 
me a bit, because the soundworld of this 
album is so wonderfully luminous that 

I feel like I could live in it. Orchestral 
strings, burbling digital synthesizers 
and Middle Eastern instruments drift 
through a sonic landscape that seems 
to hover over the main current of 
musical history. He sings quietly but 
forcefully, and is equally capable of a 
fluttery falsetto as he is of a no-holds-
barred yell (“Rudy” has both in quick 
succession). There are gestures of 
outright anachronism, like the Baroque 
accompaniment figures in “Sumer” 
and “Don’t Let It Get To You” that 
could have been shaken from the 
pages of an introductory music theory 
text, and almost bizarrely futuristic 
moments, like the almost unintelligibly 
distorted spoken word bit at the end of 
“When.” The album consistently defies 
expectations, even within songs. The 

songs dissolve into anarchic tangles 
of sound or just stop entirely before 
resuming. 
Several writers and interviewers 
have pointed out the specific queer 
energy of Rostam’s music — he has 
said that he wants to make music that 
everyone can relate to, and of course his 
songwriting is generally vague enough 
that it could let in a multiplicity of 
meanings. Certainly, it’s irresponsible 
to read someone’s work as if it’s only an 

expression of one particular identity, 
but it’s equally irresponsible to ignore 
it in favor of the “universal” (which 
always ends up skewing normative 
despite our best efforts). 
The queerness of his music is probably 
more apparent sonically than lyrically. 
The album simply does not sound like 
very much else that exists, thoroughly 
repurposing anything it inherits. The 
lyrics are vague, suggestions rather 
than statements. There’s a lot in this 
album about liminality paired with 
vastness, suggesting the morning and 
the ocean. He alludes to desires that 
sometimes lack a referent, the simple 
desire for something unnameable. On 
“Rudy”: “Rudy said ‘what do you want 
that nobody else has thought about?’ / 
Rudy said ‘I want it now / But I don’t 

know how to say it / Anyway I thought 
it was.’” On “Don’t Let It Get To You”: 
“I want to, even when it don’t make 
sense, even when it don’t make sense 
/ Actually I want to more when you 
don’t make sense.” The album seems 
to suggest a better world that doesn’t 
quite exist yet, one that we can catch 
snatches of in moments of tenderness — 
on the title track, he sings “somewhere, 
in the half-light, I could feel it coming 
true.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Maybe ‘Archer’ should
get a psychotherapist

For the past year, one of my good friends 
has been begging me to watch a show called 
“Archer,” claiming that its dark humor and 
witty running jokes would suit my tastes 
perfectly. I resisted, using school as an 
excuse, until the University of Michigan’s 
long summer break rolled around and I had 
no reason not to tackle the 10 season (and 
counting) series.
From the pilot, I was mistakenly led to 
believe that this was a brainless — albeit 
humorous — adult cartoon about a spy 
agency, but the show quickly showed its 
stripes. The protagonist, Sterling Archer 
(H. Jon Benjamin, “Bob’s Burgers”) is an 
obvious jerk, treats others as lesser and 
can never stay focused on the mission at 
hand. As the episodes go by, the audience is 
given more reasons to despise his existence 
as a deeply flawed character, and at times, 
I found myself wondering how the show 
could go on with such high ratings with 
a character that has minimal redeeming 
qualities.
Then, I noticed something interesting. 
This ‘something’ was the flashbacks to 
Archer’s childhood. The flashbacks revealed 
how his mother, Malory Archer, (Jessica 
Walter, “Arrested Development”) raised 
him, although she was mostly absent and 
extremely harsh when she was present. 
All this time, I’ve been judging Archer’s 
character based off the actions in his 
adulthood, but these flashbacks made me 
realize that like any of us, Archer was a 
product of his childhood.
Earlier on in the series, we find out 
that Archer was shipped off to boarding 
school, and in “Job Offer,” (Season One, 
Episode Nine) we learn that at some point 
in his childhood, his mother moved without 
telling his school. Archer tries to get home 
by himself, and he eventually ends up in 
a police station. In present day, Malory 
defends herself, saying “He couldn’t pick up 
a phone book?” Terrible right? It gets worse.
“Jeu Monegasque” (Season Two, Episode 
11), flashes back to a Halloween night in 
Archer’s childhood, when he loses a game 
of cards to Malory and later vomits all the 

alcohol she made him drink, even though 
he was a child. She scolds him for losing the 
card game, then for not handling his alcohol, 
and in the present, he carries with him a 
severe gambling and alcohol addiction. This 
episode reveals one of the most obvious 
reasons why Archer has these addictions, 
and it makes me wonder whether we as an 
audience can blame him for them. If we look 
at him as an adult, then yes, he’s maybe one 
of the biggest jerks on network television. 
But if we factor in the crucial context of 
his childhood misery, then we can see that 
he’s essentially a child in a man’s body. He’s 
stunted, and can we blame him?

In 
Kohlberg’s 
stages 
of 
moral 
development, the preconventional stage 
consists of children behaving in ways they 
see fit to avoid punishment. As time goes 
on, people start to develop their own moral 
compass and become fully-formed humans. 
Archer is constantly trying to cover up his 
mistakes to avoid the wrath of his mother, 
which is an action we can all resonate with 
from our own childhoods. There are few 
instances where Archer acts upon what’s 
right simply because he thinks it is, so it’s 
clear that he’s stunted in one way or another.
So, 
the 
final 
question: 
Should 
we 
determine people as good or bad based on 
their actions, or is it important to recognize 
the context from which these actions 
developed? In a world where cancel culture 
can pull up old tweets from a decade ago 
and take down a career in an instant, isn’t 
it important to realize that everyone comes 
from their own blocked out pains and 
traumas that cause them to act in ways that 
are socially frowned upon? Archer says yes, 
but right now, the world begs to differ.

There is a 10,000-kilometer-long concrete 
wall surrounding the entirety of the United 
Kingdom. The world has been shredded by 
The Change, a climatic disaster that has caused 
oceans worldwide to swell. The remains of the 
UK are governed by groomed politicians who 
are showered in special privileges. In waves, 
“Others” come desperately to the Wall’s edge to 
be turned away or killed. “The Wall” is just as 
ominous and politically drenched — if not more 
so — as its title suggests.
Longlisted for this year’s Booker Prize, John 
Lanchester’s fifth novel unabashedly turns 
up the use of metaphor to craft his dystopian 
world. It’s clear from the starting gun that he’s 
out to deliver a message on immigration and the 
dangers of environmental ignorance. A weakly-
veiled future United Kingdom established in the 
first pages, the story surrounds Kavanagh — or 
Chewy, as his company calls him — who has been 
recruited for his mandatory two-year service as 
a Defender on the Wall. Lanchester bolts into a 
second-person opening here: “It’s cold on the 
Wall. That’s the first thing that everyone tells 
you…” which seems to suggest that the previous 
Booker winner is out to produce more than just a 
regurgitated, sloppy dystopian piece, but rather 
something evocative, brave and literarily fresh. 
Readers are introduced to Kavanagh as he is 
introduced to the ill-omened, danger-nipped 
blankness of the Wall. Although this second-
person foray is washed away after a few pages, 
the effect remains. Effortlessly and quickly, 
Lanchester achieves the intrigue of young 
adult fiction while developing a style capable of 
moving a reader with prose.
Unfortunately, only the former facet is 
maintained. Spending twelve hour shifts each 

day on the Wall facing the sea, Kavanagh falls 
in love with a woman in his company. He trains 
and encounters Others. He visits his distant and 
guilt-ridden parents on his time off. And then the 
worst happens: Following an attack on the Wall 
in which Others are unintentionally allowed 
through, Kavanagh and his and associates are 
forced to leave their protected home country. 
They are forced out to sea to become Others.
To his credit, Lanchester crafts a fantastic 
pushing-your-bedtime-to-read 
novel. 
“The 
Wall” never sees a dull passage — even in sections 
describing Kavanagh merely watching the sea 
from his post, Lanchester creates an aura of 
oncoming danger (even when there is none) that 
makes the work impossible to quit. But while 

these moments of unyielding suspense make 
“The Wall” as fun as YA Fiction, the remainder of 
the novel unfortunately mismanages this style. 
Lanchester does not allow his story to breach 
the wall of this Suzanne Collins-like brevity and 
three-quarters character development. As in 
fellow Booker longlister, “My Sister, the Serial 
Killer,” Lanchester’s writing never jumps above 
average.
But it’s also clear that in developing a 
dystopian landscape Lanchester has set out to 
do more than merely write something literarily 
impressive. From its inception, the environment 
of “The Wall” is metaphorically-charged enough 
that its clear what Lanchester wants to say. A 

message sympathetic to both immigration and 
climate activists boils beneath the book’s surface. 
But does Lanchester succeed in cultivating it?
The short answer is no.
In her poem on the experience of a refugee 
and immigrant, poet Warsan Shire ends her 
work with a sharp tone: “I’ll see you on the other 
side.” It is a suggestion that stings with the reality 
of a displaced person — how easily it can happen 
to anyone. Do not neglect me, Shire seems to 
warn. It could be you. To an extent, “The Wall,” 
with a relative success, reflects this approach 
to 
imagining 
immigration. 
Very 
quickly, 
characters in “The Wall” go from those keeping 
migrants out to desperate migrants themselves. 
Lanchester repeats this mantra of “what I once 
had” throughout the novel. From the start, 
Kavanagh has nearly everything he could want; 
he manages to complain listlessly about the cold 
air outside. By the end of the novel, he is left 
speechless at the mere sight of an oil lamp. Long-
term transitions like this do a sufficient job of 
entering the story into the political conversation, 
and dare to force empathy for migrants a country 
would dare to keep out.
Though beyond this one trend, Lanchester 
never manages to deliver the blow that other 
science fiction novels (say, “The Handmaid’s 
Tale” or “Cat’s Cradle”) achieve. This is primarily 
due to a lack of strong characterization for 
Kavanagh. Prepared to shoot desperate refugees 
on sight, the main character in “The Wall” never 
has much thought about the society he protects. 
This indifference is not the stinging type that 
acts as a magnet to force readers to acknowledge 
the scenario themselves. Readers simply don’t 
care. Without this acknowledgement and 
without many humanizing glimpses of The 
Others outside of the Wall, it is too easy to forget 
about the political implications established from 
the start.

‘The Wall’ is almost significant

The Wall 

John Lanchester

W.W. Norton & Company

Jan. 17, 2019

Most of these songs are about a minute 
too long but it doesn’t bother me a bit, 
because the soundworld of this album is 
so wonderfully luminous that I feel like 
I could live in it

Like any of us, 
Archer was a 
product of his 
childhood


“A Pakistani into Springsteen. Now that’s 
got potential,” sneered the editor of Javed 
Khan’s (Viveik Kalra, “Next of Kin”) high 
school newspaper in 1987 Luton, England. 
Javed had just submitted an article in 
homage to the American rock legend — or 
myth, depending on where you stand — 
Bruce Springsteen.
But I wonder if that is how Warner Bros. 
responded when “Blinded by the Light,” 
the story of the empowerment of a working 
class, British-Pakistani teenager via Bruce 
Springsteen’s music, was first pitched. And 
I wonder if the filmmakers would have 
taken issue with that reductive stance. Still, 
I wonder if that’s always what it takes — 
exotic, absurd shock value — to persuade the 
establishment that an anti-canonical story 
deserves a platform. No matter the extent of 
your own cynicism regarding the future of 
representation in Western media, “Blinded 
by the Light” still registers as a product of 
this regime, so it fails to reinvigorate a genre, 
merely propping up a new story with the old 
tricks.
Javed can’t find a girlfriend. His parents 
are conservative and keep usurping his 
independence, his youthful pleasure-seeking. 
His high school cafeteria is divided into 
cliques he calls “tribes,” and he voices-over 
his uncertainty about where to sit. Sound 
familiar? Sound like every other high school 
comedy-drama? By and large, that’s “Blinded 
by the Light”: endearing but unsophisticated, 
youthful but unpracticed. 
Still worse, the film distills parts of Javed’s 
unique experience into something existing 
tropes can contain: for instance, it localizes 
skinheads’ racist, xenophobic violence into 
the high school bullying trope, which helps 
conceal the already well-guarded systemic 
dimension of this violence. A similar film 
that more successfully broke the mold of 
high school storytelling is George Tillman 
Jr.’s (“The Longest Ride”) adaption of Angie 
Thomas’s book “The Hate U Give,” which 
not only sought out a new cast of characters, 
but changed the terms of the high school 
narrative itself. Starr (Amandla Stenberg, 
“Everything, Everything”) and her brother 

bicker over breakfast before their father 
briefs them on how to behave when a cop 
stops them. Starr has a white, wealthy 
boyfriend, 
but 
their 
racially-motivated 
expectations about each other shape the 
relationship. None of the social complexities 
are drowned in the ordinary parts of Starr’s 
adolescence.
All the same, perhaps “Blinded by the 
Light” stands out in the way it connects a 
working-class musician from New Jersey 
with 
a 
working-class 
British-Pakistani 
teenager in a raw, comforting, empowering 
way. Given my experience, I can’t fully 
appreciate what Springsteen’s music can 
do, so neither am I in a position to discredit 
it. But a throwaway line in “Blinded by the 
Light” stood out to me: “You do know Ronald 
Reagan listens to him, right?” Javed’s activist 
girlfriend Eliza (Nell Williams, “London 

Town”) asks him. While the line is delivered 
in jest, I couldn’t help but wonder if people 
of privilege in America hear the same thing 
— if the skinheads, amid their Thatcherite 
resurgence in the time of the film, would hear 
what Javed hears — when Springsteen sings.
Nor could I help thinking of poet 
and cultural critic Hanif Abdurraqib’s 
perspective on Springsteen. In “A Night in 
Bruce Springsteen’s America,” Abdurraqib 
regales his experience of a Springsteen 
concert in New Jersey, days after visiting the 
place where Michael Brown was killed. “I 
have been thinking a lot about the question 
of who gets to revel in their present with an 
eye still on their future,” the author reflects. 
Applying this framework to the mythology 
of Springsteen, Adburraqib adds, “What 
I understand about The River now that I 
didn’t before I saw it in New Jersey is that 
this is an album about coming to terms with 
the fact that you are going to eventually die, 
written by someone who seemed to have an 

understanding of the fact that he was going 
to live for a long time. It is an album of a 
specific type of optimism — one not afforded 
to everyone who listens to it.”
In the world that this film imagines, Javed 
cashes in on this optimism, repeatedly. It 
gets him out of his parents’ house, across 
the Atlantic and, in the end, to his dream 
school, on the path to his dream career. But 
I am doubtful it could sustain him forever, 
and I can instead see it bankrupting him, 
somewhere outside of the film’s frame. 
Perhaps within a decade, even, as the 
War on Terror and Islamophobia began 
to take a more regional hold, especially in 
Springsteen’s homeland.
I 
recalled 
Abdurraqib’s 
assessment 
in almost every instance of Javed’s fiery 
speeches 
about 
Springsteen’s 
universal 
messages, but especially when he invoked 
Springsteen in his pursuit of a girlfriend. I 
was once told by a boy, whose Bruce fandom 
easily rivals Javed’s, that Springsteen’s music 
made him think of me. Before “Blinded by 
the Light,” I wasn’t sure if I liked that. After 
seeing it, I’m still uneasy about his association. 
Our relationship was inappropriate and 
exploitative in multiple respects, and I paid 
for it. But now I wonder, how much of it 
had to do with what he learned from his 
idol? I don’t think I could match the woman 
Bruce Springsteen promised him he would 
find because I was not a figment of a man’s 
imagination. I was — am — a real person of 
my own. No romanticized ideal will ever 
change that. But I don’t know if I will ever fit 
into Springsteen’s purview that way.
When Javed went off on the American 
Dream sales pitch in an attempt to convince 
his conservative father to let him travel to 
Springsteen’s home state of New Jersey, the 
people around me in the Ann Arbor theater 
laughed. If Springsteen danced across 
the graveyard of the American Dream, its 
ghost still found its way into his lyrics and 
ideology. No matter who you are, that ghost 
— promising reward for hard work regardless 
of identity, when identity continues to be 
leveraged against people no matter what 
work they do — will greet you as soon as 
Springsteen opens his mouth to rasp the first 
verse of “Born to Run.” I shook my head and 
tried to listen to the rest of a sanguine speech 
I’d heard many times before.

Adorned 
with 
his 
signature 
red watch cap, Channel Tres has 
nowhere to go but up. For the last 
year or so, the producer has been 
popping up in some surprising 
places, trying to make a name for 
himself. Aside from his own Detroit 
techno-inspired dance music, he 
can be found remixing songs from a 
wide array of genres, most recently 
tinkering with Toro y Moi’s “Who 
I Am” and Mark Ronson and Lykke 
Li’s “Late Night Feelings.” Both are 
great remixes and assist in building 
his fanbase, but they fail to flaunt 
Tres’s weirder, more exploratory 
side. With his most recent release, 
Black Moses, Tres has an opportunity 
to bring his eccentricities to the 
dance mainstream, and maybe even 
beyond.
On Black Moses, Tres is heavily 
influenced 
by 
Detroit 
techno 
overlord Moodymann. Even his 
vocal 
delivery 
and 
monologues 
are reminiscent of the influential 
and hermetic producer. His voice 
is low and monotonous, giving 
his often visceral subject matter 
a subdued feel. However, where 
Moodymann’s samples are often 
soulful and familiar, calling back 
to Detroit’s Motown era, Channel 
Tres’s are futuristic and inventive. 
On standout track “Brilliant N****,” 

Tres creates a musical mosaic, fluid 
and vibrant in its sound choices. The 
drums are bouncy and danceable 
and the bassline is juicy, but the 
song’s shining moments occur when 
the flute sample manifests itself. It 
feels like the flutes carry the listener 
through the song, like a cartoon 
character being led by the scent of a 
fresh-baked pie. It brings the perfect 
amount of flair to the song and acts 
as an accent to lines like, “The drugs 
is in the groove, you know / I’m the 
shit that got you comatose.”
Equally danceable but less flashy 
is the penultimate track “Sexy 
Black Timberlake.” Icy, warbling 
synths and sputtering bass serve 

as the perfect vehicle to deliver 
braggadocious exclamations like, 
“Oh, cause bitches goin’ crazy / 
Bitches act crazy / Better watch 
your old lady / Tryna get in my 
house.” Closing song “Raw Power” 
is more of the same. It’s a fun song 
in which Tres claims that he has 
raw, unrefined power at his shows, 
just like when Iggy Pop first burst 

onto the Ann Arbor scene, but it 
drags a little. There just isn’t enough 
variation or excitement in the beat 
or delivery to justify the length of 
the song.
The strangest song on the album 
is also the song that best showcases 
Channel 
Tres’s 
potential. 
The 
titular track is Tres at his most 
experimental, and a guest verse 
from rap idiosyncrat JPEGMAFIA 
cements that claim. Starting with 
a demented bassline that could’ve 
came straight from Kenny Beats’s 
arsenal, Tres sprinkles in short 
bursts of vocal chops to fill in the 
gaps. He and JPEGMAFIA go on to 
spit their game and talk their shit, 
and in doing so, they created one of 
the most inventive and unique rap 
songs of the year.
At a mere five songs, Black Moses 
is over almost as soon as it begins, 
forcing listeners to restart the EP at 
least one time (in my case, after my 
first listen, I replayed the tape four 
more times). Its brief length pulls 
listeners in and traps them inside the 
hypnotizing productions, leaving 
them practically begging for more. 
If Black Moses is a sign of things to 
come, Channel Tres is about to be in 
a favorable position. These songs go 
hard and can be played in nearly any 
circumstance that calls for letting 
loose and dancing like a fool, and 
for an artist trying to put their name 
on the map, this can only be a good 
thing.

Tres bounces on ‘Black Moses’

JIM WILSON
Daily Arts Writer

Like many young girls between the ages 
of four and nine, as a child I desperately 
wanted to be a princess. I wrote 
books about a magical kingdom called 
Abdominium (original name, I know) 
where I would be queen, with a beautiful 
knight to save me from the boredom of 
the Michigan suburbs I called home. I 
convinced myself not only that fairies 
were real, but also that I could talk to 
squirrels, and briefly, control the weather. 
If you couldn’t tell by now, I was a weird 
kid. 
Although my obsession with my made-
up dream world only lasted until around 
fourth grade, a fixation on the idea of the 
princess remained. My mom had stopped 
buying me Barbies and I realized that the 
production value on the Pegasus movie 
series wasn’t high enough to warrant 
my viewership. But still, I wanted long 
dresses. I wanted a prince and a castle 
and a canopy over a big four-poster bed. I 
wasn’t ever going to be a real princess — 
that was silly, I was older now, entering 
middle school like a real girl — but I could 
at least look like one. And so I began 
growing my hair. 

My mother relished in the prospect of 
a baby Rapunzel, plunking me in a chair 
every morning to pull and brush my 
golden locks into braids and pigtails and 
everything in between. She was and still 
is extremely skilled with complicated 
hairstyles, and I trust her to blow my hair 
out when it’s really important. But from 
her, I learned the art and importance 
of good hair. It continued to grow, I 
continued my life as a princess in spirit, 

and secretly read “The Princess Diaries” 
in bed even though it was uncool. 
I grew out of my flashlight reading, but 
not out of my ponytail. At least not for a 
while. As I was thrust into the world of all-
girls middle school and high school sports, 
I became the designated hair braider of 
each sports team locker room and free 
moment we found in the halls. I was proud 
of my skills, and wore my hair in ballet 
buns and braids and even dyed it pink for 
a moment. Then, as all women do once 
and a while, I had an existential crisis. I 
chopped off the hair I had prized for so 
many years to a shoulder-length bob, tried 
to put it in a ponytail and cried. But the 
loss of my high pony wasn’t completely a 
bad thing. I could do new things with my 
hair. And something more important had 
occurred. I wasn’t a princess anymore; I 
was just a girl. 
Although trivial to the naked eye, my 
hair and everything I learned from it 
may have started in a way to get close 
to princess-dom, but became a way for 
me to bond with other women. It still 
is, honestly. If you traverse The Daily 
newsroom on any given day, there is often 
one victim of my braiding sitting at the 
Arts desk. This is something I kept from 
my childhood obsession, something that’s 
served me well at sleepovers and parties 
until the present day. Hair, though purely 
aesthetic, means a lot to women. When 
you understand that, you start to realize 
how much bravery it takes to put your 
hair in someone else’s hand: Every choice 
ripples out further than just your head, 
affecting your self-image and confidence 
simultaneously. 
Now, after six years of hair that has 
barely brushed my clavicle, I have decided 
to grow it again. It’s reminded me of what 
it’s like to feel so incredibly feminine, and 
it’s reminded me of how I found feminity 
beyond my appearance during my short-
haired years. Away from the princesses and 
into the rock and art scenes I discovered 
later, my life as a feminine woman became 
something completely unrelated to my 
hair. By separating the remnants of a 
girlish ideal from my identity as an adult, 
I found another way of being myself, 
embracing style and writing and music as 
the things that make up who I am. Yes, I 
still love hair. But it’s not everything. I’ve 
climbed down from the tower, only to cut 
off the ladder and build a new path.

The Michigan football team won its first game of the season last week, 
beating Middle Tennesee State, 40-21. Now it faces its first real test, 
as Army comes to Ann Arbor at noon on Saturday, bringing a triple-
option and a starting lineup that returns most of its starters from an 
11-win campaign in 2018. The Wolverines are three-score favorites 
on the Vegas line, but must avoid a stumble before Big Ten play starts 
in two weeks with a road trip to Wisconsin. In particular, that test will 
come for a young defense against Army’s triple-option attack.

The Daily breaks down Army’s tape from 
its opening week victory over Rice.

Middle Tennessee State (Aug. 31): We’ve been 
trying to think of something for 15 minutes but 
haven’t gotten 2 it.

Army (Sept. 7): Please God, let Army only lose 
to football teams.

Penn State (Oct. 19): WE ARE ... incapable of 
thinking of a joke that we can actually print.

otherwise known as Michigan Stadium East.
Wisconsin (Sept. 21): Wisconsin’s biggest 
turnover was the Upper Peninsula.

Michigan State (Nov. 16): The Michigan Daily

downgrade.

Iowa (Oct. 5): Apparently the World’s Largest 
Truck Stop is in Iowa. It’s also known as Iowa 
City.

Illinois (Oct. 12): It’s as if Lovie Smith got rel-

As Wolverines prepare for Army, defensive line 
coach Shaun Nua brings rivalry experience

Shaun Nua remembers the 
last time he beat Army. That 
December day in Philadelphia 
four years ago, Nua was on the 
sidelines, 
coaching 
defensive 
line at Navy — the Black Knights’ 
fiercest rival. The Midshipmen 
finished with eight tackles for 
loss and three sacks in rivalry 
win number four for Nua, now 
Michigan’s defensive line coach. 
Together, those four victories 
were 
Nua’s 
favorite 
rivalry 
moments.
But Army won the next two 
years — Nua’s last two. His 
final taste of the rivalry was a 
heartbreaking, 14-13 loss in 2017 
when, with snow swirling all 
around, Navy’s kicker missed a 
field goal on the last play.
Nua left the next year for 
Arizona State, but it would only 
be two years before he got another 
shot at the Black Knights, albeit 
with the Wolverines. With him, 
Nua brings years of experience 
teaching players how to defend 
the triple option — the unique 
offense that is Army’s calling 
card.
Addressing 
reporters 
Wednesday, Nua was careful to 
point out that he’s far from the 
only one on Michigan’s staff 
who has experience with the 
triple 
option. 
Offensive 
line 
coach Ed Warinner spent 12 
years with the Black Knights, 
including two years as their 
offensive coordinator in 1998-
99. Defensive coordinator Don 
Brown has seen it plenty of 
times, including in 2017, when 
he coached the Wolverines to an 
easy win over Air Force.
A few defensive players still 
remain who started that game 
— safety Josh Metellus, viper 
Khaleke Hudson and defensive 
back Lavert Hill — with several 
others playing at some point. All 
the experience, from the staff 
down to the backfield, only helps.
“We’ve 
definitely 
been 
working on Army since the 
spring,” said junior safety Brad 
Hawkins, who also saw the 
field during the 2017 game. 
“Definitely started doing it more 
during camp as well, but we’re 
definitely gonna be prepared 

for Army. … (It’s) gonna give 
us a challenge. But if we play 
Michigan defense, we run to the 
ball, we tackle well, we should be 
perfectly fine.”
When asked his main key, Nua 
preferred to keep it simple.
“Don’t let them run the ball,” 
he said.
That’s a near impossibility 
for a team with an offense that’s 
designed to always run the ball. 
But there are ways to keep a team 
like that contained: hold them to 
short yardage and force them 
into third- and fourth-and-longs.
Against the triple option, you 
must prepare to play four downs 
instead of three. Nua pointed 
out that the Black Knights went 
for it on fourth-and-1 from their 
own 25 against Rice — a notion 
so ridiculous for any other team 
that it elicited laughs from the 
reporters in attendance. But 
without the threat of a downfield 
shot, 
Nua 
and 
the 
players 
alike noted that if they stay 
disciplined, they should be just 
fine. After all, this has been one 
of the most elite defenses in the 
country for the past four years, 
and that goes the same against 
any type of offense.
“It’s a unique offense, it’s 
something that we don’t see 
every day,” Nua said. “It’s such 
a spread offensive world that 
you see the triple option, it’s just 
different, but other than that, it’s 
still football. You still gotta get 
11 guys to do their assignment 
and get to the ball as hard as they 
can.”
In an era when most Power 
Five teams do everything they 
can to avoid scheduling service 
academies due to their unique 
style and discipline, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh likes to play 
them just for the fun of it.
But with experienced players 
and coaches and Nua’s requisite 
distaste for an old rival, it’s a 
challenge the Wolverines believe 
they are well equipped to handle.
“I never liked Army, but the 
motivation’s 
still 
the 
same,” 
Nua said. “You want to give our 
players and Michigan the best 
chance to win, not because I hate 
Army because I was at Navy, 
that’s a personal thing, but you 
want to win every game the same 
way.”

Jack Harbaugh sat on his couch 
in Wisconsin, his youngest son 
three days removed from the end 
of spring practice over 300 miles 
away, when he felt a fist. Other 
than some discomfort while tak-
ing a walk, he didn’t have any 
symptoms — no sweating, no 
nausea, no pain in his arm. Just 
that fist. A pop right above his 
heart, cinching him tight, like 
someone grabbing and not let-
ting go.
He looked at his wife, Jackie, 
who had been with him watching 
North Carolina and Villanova in 
the national title game. “We gotta 
go,” Jack told her, and from there, 
it was a straight shot to Ascension 
Columbia St. Mary’s Hospital 
Ozaukee in Mequon, Wiscon-
sin. Years prior, John Harbaugh 
recalled, Jack had been on some 
medication but didn’t like it and 
never went back. At age 76, Jack 
didn’t have a doctor; he was on no 
medicine whatsoever. If he woke 
up with pain, he shook it off. “I 
mean, I was one of those guys,” 
he said this summer. “... You just 
don’t — you just don’t.”
Upon arrival at the hospital, 
things moved fast. The doctors 
performed tests, then woke Jack 
up at 4 a.m. to tell him he had a 
heart attack. He needed four 

bypasses. They were going to do 
catheterization in the morning.
Jack thinks Jackie called the kids 
after that was done.
Three years later, Jim Harbaugh 
doesn’t want to speak at length 
about that moment. The lines 
of mortality had already been 
converging when the call came 
— two months after Jack’s heart 
attack, Jim signed an addendum 
to his own contract to include 
a life insurance policy. He says 
now that the heart attack didn’t 
change his relationship with his 
father, that the only shift in his 
own perspective since then is 
rooted in his dad’s actions. Jim 
pivots to discussing how watch-
ing his dad work himself back 
into shape at the crux of his late 
70s changed his perspective, but 
he doesn’t get profound or philo-
sophical. As Jim talks, a chair sits 
outside his office. Jack resides 
there for a portion of each work 
day, within shouting distance 
of his son, holding a job title as 
special advisor to the Michigan 
football program. Jack has no 
office or designated workspace 
in Schembechler Hall. The chair, 
perched right outside Jim’s door, 
is all he needs.
In 2004, Jim’s first year as a col-
lege head coach, Jack took a 

leave of absence from his job as 
an associate athletic director at 
Marquette and drove three days 
to join his son’s staff at the Uni-
versity of San Diego, as a running 
backs coach. They both lived 
in Coronado, about 25 minutes 
south of campus. In the morn-
ings, Jim would swing by, pick up 
his dad and they’d drive to work. 
Their conversations often cen-
tered on football — the day-to-
day happenings of the team 
— and Jim picked his dad’s brain 
on every aspect of running a pro-
gram. As the day went on, they’d 
stand side by side on the field dur-
ing practice, sit next to each other 
in meetings. When they drove 
home, Jack became Jim’s sound-
ing board, a voice on his staff he 
could trust completely. Their 
conversations ascended the poli-
tics inherent in coaching. Jack 
could relate to every challenge, 
including that of raising a fam-
ily with the demands placed on a 
football coach. If they disagreed 
on something, it was OK.
“It was life-changing to have that 
year with him,” Jim Harbaugh 
told The Daily.
Whatever rushed into Jim’s brain 
at the moment he got that call, he 
and both his siblings, John and 
Joani, dropped what they were 

doing and came to Wisconsin the 
day before Jack’s surgery. The 
heart attack, relatively speaking, 
was minor. The word minor in 
relation to a heart attack, though, 
belies the point, which John Har-
baugh makes without obscurity 
or obfuscation. “They said that 
if he hadn’t gone in there,” John 
said, “he wouldn’t have made it 
through the night.”
Jack had 90 percent blockage in 
two of his three main arteries. 
Surgery was set for Thursday. 
Once they got there, Jim and 
John stayed through the night, 
playing chess at the foot of their 
father’s hospital bed, arguing 
over some trivial game like noth-
ing had changed.
The family tried to keep things 
lighthearted. After Jack’s sur-
gery, Jim took pictures, though 
his father had little interest in 
seeing them. Jack wanted to be 
out of the hospital by Monday, 
four days later, because the doc-
tor told him the record was five.
“I didn’t make it. I got out in 
about six,” Jack said. “But it’s just 
— that’s the way I think. ‘Well, 
tell me what I have to do.’ Coach-
able.”
Jim Harbaugh says he’s tried to 
hire his dad every single year at 
every single head coaching job 

he’s had. After that first year, 
2004, Jack politely declined, 
driving back to Milwaukee with 
Jackie. His answer stayed the 
same as the years passed, first 
due to his duties at Marquette 
and then because he had 
retired. He was happy to 
visit or offer advice, and 
did so with regularity. 
Besides the 2009 
Sun Bowl, when 
he 
briefly 
joined 
Jim’s 

Stanford staff to coach running 
backs because of a departure, he 
never took a job on the payroll.
In the wake of his heart attack, 
though, Jack opened up to the 


idea. Tom Crean, Joani’s hus-
band, had moved from Marquette 
to coach Indiana basketball 
by then. Moving to Ann Arbor 
would put him closer to all three 
of his kids. “I remember making 
that argument,” Jim Harbaugh 
said. “And maybe resonating.” 
Players Jack had coached in the 
‘70s, and his colleagues on Bo 
Schembechler’s staff, still lived in 
the area. He could live next door 
to his grandkids and see them 
every day.
Making 
the 
decision, 
Jack 
thought about the sacrifices he 
made while his own kids grew up. 
Famously, Jim Harbaugh grew 
up going to Michigan football 
practices when his dad coached 
defensive backs. Less famously, 
Jack brought his kids to practic-
es at other stops along the road. 
Almost never talked about is that 
during those practices, Jack was 
doing his job, not being a dad. 
At Iowa, he made time with his 
kids by occasionally bringing 
them on Friday night recruiting 
trips to Cedar Rapids. In the car, 
he’d ask the questions parents 
ask their elementary school-aged 
kids — who’s your best friend, 
how’s school. He’d turn the radio 
off and listen as they told him 
about the lives he sometimes 
felt he was missing. Those are 
the moments he values now, but 
that time with his kids, he freely 
admits, was often scant.
This, he decided, was a chance 
to make up for it. In July 2016, he 
moved to Ann Arbor, quietly tak-
ing a job as senior advisor to the 
head coach.
“I look back on my years of coach-
ing, it goes 46 years and there 
were days I would leave at 6 in 
the morning, come home at 11 
at night,” Jack Harbaugh said. 
“The head coach of our family 
was Jackie. And now I got a little 
time on my hands to make up for 
those times that I wasn’t around, 
maybe around my kids. I’m get-
ting a second chance, and I’m not 
gonna, hopefully, screw it up.”
Jim doesn’t see his father as an 
absentee parent. He remembers 
Jack stopping whatever he was 
doing to help him with math 
homework or throw a ball around 
with his sister. “I just want to be 
exactly like him,” Jim said. “... 
The kind of dad that takes you 
to ballgames, plays catch with 
you, believes in you.” Jackie 
always made sure they lived close 
enough to wherever Jack was 
coaching that he could make it 
home for dinner, even if just for 
an hour. During the offseason — 
recruiting being less than the all-
encompassing job it is now — he 
could spend more time with the 
family.
When Jim and John played Ann 

Arbor rec baseball, Jack coached. 
He took the job seriously, going 
on a recruiting spree and pick-
ing off talent from around town. 

Years later, John rattles off half 
the roster from memory — a left-
handed pitcher from Ypsilanti, a 
catcher who couldn’t start on a 
different team, a third baseman 
who no one else wanted. “We 
were like a magnet for all the mis-
fits,” John said. “We won.” 
A local baseball team made up of 
castoffs winning its league brings 
with it an element of clichéd 
romanticism, but there’s some-
thing to it. Jim pitched, usually 
the three-inning maximum “and 
usually it was nine pitches,” John 

said. Unlike the kids’ Pop Warner 
football games, which usually 
fell on work days for Jack, this 
was time the family could spend 

together.
One year, Jim and John wanted 
to try out for a hockey team and 
were told they couldn’t because 
football season was still going on. 
Jackie says she told the person in 
charge that her kids were 12 and 
they would never be told to give 
up something they wanted to try. 
Football, she wants to make clear, 
was never a preordained fate.
At the end of that Pop Warner 
season, she says, a host of play-
ers including her sons tried out 
for the hockey team and made 

it anyway. She woke up at 5 a.m. 
to drive them to practice and sat 
behind the net, away from the 
other parents who complained 

about their kids’ playing time. 
Jack managed to get to the games 
on occasion and the team won 
its league with Jim as a first-line 
forward.
Still, football practices were for-
mative. Anyone who has spent 
time around the family agrees 
to that. There’s a reason they 
were written about ad nauseam 
when Jim took the Michigan 
job in 2015. Jim and the rest of 
the coaching staff’s kids played 
around on a side field while the 
team practiced and their fathers 
coached. Jack drove his kids 
home for dinner and they’d recap 
the day, Jim and John enamored 
by their interactions with star 
players.
Even before that, Jim’s first mem-
ories are going to one of his dad’s 
practices. “About five years old,” 
Jim said, “And car rides home 
from practice.”
When fall weekends came in 
Ann Arbor, Jack would stay at 
the team hotel and Jackie would 
bring Jim and John to the stadi-
um. They both had jobs on game 
days — Jim moved plugs from one 
electrical outlet to the other. But 
while Jim was on the sideline, 
Jack sat in the press box. They 
didn’t interact during games. “In 
fact, I don’t even remember driv-

ing home with him,” Jack said.
Jim eventually made a career for 
himself as an NFL quarterback 
and later a coach. His schedule 

aligned with Jack’s, though it 
was just as busy. The family lived 
in separate places surrounded 
by separate teams, but they had 
the offseasons, and when Jim 
played for the Colts, it was only 
a 3-hour drive to Western Ken-
tucky, where Jack coached, short 
enough that he could come on 
staff as an unpaid recruiting 
assistant for the cash-strapped 
program.
Jim had no office at Western 
Kentucky’s football building, the 
same as Jack at Michigan now. 
He’d spend three or four weeks 
during the winter on the road 
recruiting Florida. For one or two 
of those weeks, Jack estimates, 
they’d go out together, waking up 
at 7 a.m. and driving across the 
Route 4 corridor — Orlando to 
Tampa Bay, and all the talent-rich 
high schools in between. They’d 
go until 11 or so, then get up the 
next day and do it again, build-
ing the nucleus of Jack’s program 
together.
Jack put in 14-hour days running 
Western Kentucky until leav-
ing for an administrative job at 
Marquette after the 2002 season. 
It’s impossible to know the effect 
coaching for over 40 years had on 
his health, but it’s easy enough to 
infer that it wasn’t good. When 

he told Jim after the 2004 season 
that he wouldn’t return to his San 
Diego staff, he put it in terms of 
letting the bird fly away from the 
nest. He says now that the game 
had passed him by. 
Still, though, he watches prac-
tice tape of both Michigan and 
the Ravens and offers both sons 
advice. When asked to posit why, 
Jackie calls to her husband, sit-
ting nearby playing euchre on an 
iPad, to get a direct answer. He 
falls back on that cliché: that he’s 
just trying to catch up to a game 
that outran him. She laughs. 
“Well that’s not a true answer.”
“... I think that he really does 
it because he loves the game,” 
Jackie said. “And he is learning 
by doing it. And if he has sugges-
tions — he always says he never 
gives suggestions unless he’s 
asked — but I’ve known him to 
give suggestions when he sees 
something.”
The specifics of those conversa-
tions, though, remain private 
between father and son. Jack 
says he tries to be a fly on the wall 
when sitting in Michigan’s foot-
ball meetings, and every player 
interviewed for this story backed 
up that description.
His presence in Schembechler 
Hall is fairly quiet. Jack is around 
for support, sitting in his chair 
and willing to talk with anyone. 
Players catch him sometimes in 
Jim’s office, deep in conversa-
tion, and know he holds some 
influence, but as far as they’re 
concerned, he’s something like a 
friend.
“Guys just come in and out and 
are able to talk to somebody about 
what’s going on in their lives,” 
Noah Furbush, a linebacker from 
2015-18, said. “You see that a lot 
with Jack.”
Once Jim took the job at Michi-
gan, Jack spent a lot of time 
around the program, even before 
he moved. He’s always been a 
presence in his sons’ football lives 
— at Stanford, Jack was known 
to find an empty office to go 
over practice tape when he came 
through town. Michigan’s play-
ers noticed little change when his 
job became formal and he started 
living in Ann Arbor, spending 
days in a chair by Jim’s office.
The Jim Harbaugh of 2015 
looked more like an overgrown 
child than someone considering 
mortality. He’s commonly carica-
tured as someone focused solely 
on football, oblivious to the rest 
of the world and tuned in only to 
competition, and at no time in his 
life was that image more promi-
nent.

This one’s been circled 
on 
the 
calendar 
for 
months. Maybe more of 
a tepid oval, actually. It’s 
not the same anticipation 
as an Ohio State or Notre 
Dame game, 
but 
one 
born 
more 
of curiosity. 
Don Brown 
and 
his 
defense 
have 
been 
preparing 
for 
Army’s 
notorious 
triple-
option look 
for 
months 
now. 
The 
Black 
Knights 
will come into Michigan 
Stadium on Saturday an 
experienced group, coming 
off an 11-win season and a 
season-opening 14-7 win 
over Rice.
After 
reviewing 
the 
tape, 
though, 
Michigan 
might 
be 
able 
to 
identify 
a 
few 
unexpected 
weak 
spots. Here 
are 
five 
thoughts 
from 
Army’s 
win 
last 
weekend, 
and 
how 
the 
Wolverines 
might 
approach 
the 
matchup 
with that in mind.
Is 
Army 
who 
we 
thought they were?
Not 
to 
channel 
an 
inner 
Dennis 
Green, 
but there were a few 
uncharacteristic elements 
in 
Army’s 
performance 
last week. This is a team 
that returned a majority of 
its starters from an 11-win 
group in 2018. The Black 
Knights 
will 
likely 
be 
favored in every game this 
year except the Michigan 
game. Their quarterback, 
Kelvin Hopkins Jr., comes 
back after a 2018 in which 

he posted 1000-plus yards 
rushing and passing for the 
first time in school history.
There were plenty of 
preseason 
grumblings 
about the treachery this 
game might pose.
But Army left plenty 
to 
be 
desired 
in 
an 
uninspiring performance 
on both sides of the ball. 
Their 
normally-potent 
triple-option attack was 
largely held at bay, totaling 
231 yards on 56 carries (4.1 
yards per carry) against 
a defense that finished 
112th in the nation (of 130) 
in 2018. That was nearly 
100 yards shy of last year’s 
season average. Defensive 
coaches frequently preach 
discipline when defending 
triple 
option. 
Don’t 
overcommit. Fill your gap. 
Stay patient.
By and large, Rice did 
a good job with that. 
Startlingly well, in fact. 
For the Black Knights, 
much of that stemmed 
from their difficulty to 
secure blocking on the 
edge. This was no one-off 
occurrence, 
either. 
If 
Army’s 
offensive 
line 
has 
trouble 
squaring 
up 
Rice’s 
edge 
guys, 
Khaleke 
Hudson, 
Josh Uche, 
Josh 
Ross 
and co. will 
surely make things far 
more difficult. 
For 
Army, 
and 
the 
triple-option writ large, 
it’s less about the chunk 
plays 
(though 
they 
obviously 
help). 
More 
vital is securing forward 
movement on every play, 
reaching 
a 
manageable 
down and distance and 
chewing up clock. When 
first and second down 
don’t go according to plan, 
well, third down rarely 
follows suit, either.
Because 
when 
its 
offense comes up against 
an obvious passing down…
...that doesn’t usually 

portend success.
Big 
game 
for 
the 
interior defensive line 
and linebackers
Defensive 
line 
coach 
Shaun 
Nua 
said 
on 
Wednesday 
that 
defensive 
linemen 
Donovan 
Jeter 
and 
Michael 
Dwumfour 
were 
both 
“ready 
to 
go”. 
That’s 
important news regardless, 
but especially so given the 

strain Army is going to try 
to put on the Wolverines’ 
interior. Despite its week 
one struggles, this is still 
an offense 
that 
can 
give 
you 
fits. 
And 
especially 
given 
the 
high 
frequency 
of 
snaps 
the Black 
Knights 
will 
run, 
having 
a 
full breadth of defensive 
linemen available will be 
crucial.

For all the negatives, 
Army 
still 
put 
some 
good stuff on tape. Given 
Michigan’s 
questions 
on the interior of the 
defensive 
line, 
getting 
pushed around should be 
the primary worry coming 
into the weekend.
Expect the full rotation 
to see time — Dwumfour, 
Jeter, senior Carlo Kemp, 
freshman 
Chris 
Hinton 
and junior Ben Mason. 
Perhaps this might be 
the week for freshman 
Mazi Smith to see 
the field as well, if 
only 
to 
spell 
the 
aforementioned.

If any player asserts 
himself among the group 
Saturday, that could open 
an avenue for more playing 
time in run downs going 
forward.
Defense struggled at 
times
Far 
from 
the 
most 
prolific 
attack, 
Rice 
had 
plenty 
of 
success 
gouging Army’s defense, 
particularly on the ground.

The Michigan defense must stay disciplined in order to stop Army’s triple-option offense from staying on the field for long periods.

More vital 
is securing 
forward 
movement.

This is still an 
(Army) offense 
that can give 
you fits.

Much 
of 
the 
conversation 
around 
this 
game 
centers 
around the other side of the 
ball, that’s the natural tendency 
when a triple-option side comes 
to town. But it’s hard to see 
the Wolverines’ offense being 
bothered much by the group it’s 
facing. Army’s best defense this 
week might be its offense — and 
whether it can control enough 
clock to keep Shea Patterson and 
co. off the field.
They will have tricks up 

their sleeves
One of Army’s biggest plays 
of the game last week came on 
some trickeration — a reverse to 
wide receiver Christian Hayes 
for 35 yards on third and nine. 
This is a pretty simple counter 
off a normal speed option look, 
and yet, the Rice defender over-
pursues, leaving the back end 
wide open.
If they had it in the bag for 
Rice, there’s surely more where 
that came from this weekend. 

Lock it in.
Don’t let things stay close 
late
The real weapon of the triple 
option 
comes 
through 
the 
repetition. When it works, the 
excess of possession not only 
allows for infinite counters off 
the standard looks — as seen in 
some of the trickeration — but 
also an immeasurable impact on 
the opposing team’s stamina and 
wherewithal. It’s like a boxer 
that jabs and jabs and jabs, goes 

11 rounds and wins by decision. 
The opponent leaves helpless.
The 
worst 
thing 
the 
Wolverines could do this week is 
let Army hang around until the 
fourth quarter. That could spell 
doom for a depleted defense.
Last week, the two deadlocked 
at 7-7 in the fourth quarter, the 
Black Knights turned in a vintage 
18-play, 96-yard drive that took 
up 9:21. This is the kind of push 
they were getting on that drive.
It 
ended 
in 
this 
17-yard 

touchdown pass, and that was 
that.
Frankly, 
if 
Michigan 
has 
its ‘A’ game, this shouldn’t be 
much of a game. But if it falls 
short of that, letting Army 
poke, prod and hang around, 
there’s a nightmare scenario 
which features a similar ending. 
There’s 
a 
reason 
Michigan’s 
staff has been preparing for this 
unique challenge for several 
months. Saturday, we’ll find out 
how ready they are.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
The Michigan defense must stay ready for trick plays, as Army’s extensive use of the triple-option can easily set up a defense to expect the same thing every time, clearing the lane for trickeration.

How to defend Army’s triple-option

Brian 
Smith 
remembers 
the first time he saw Army on 
the 
schedule. 
The 
reaction, 
naturally, was dread. Now the 
defensive coordinator at Rice, 
which lost 14-7 to the Black 
Knights last week, that’s what 
happens when he thinks about 
preparing his defense to face the 
triple option.
His second reaction was more 
calculated. Smith didn’t need 
to dig too far into the recesses 
of his memory to recall the last 
time he faced a triple-option 
offense. It was only two years 
ago and the results — 13 points 
allowed on 3.4 yards per carry 
— were exactly what he hoped 
to replicate last Friday. So Smith 
took to his notes.
If 
that 
sounds 
familiar, 
that’s because it should. Smith 
was 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
backs coach in 2017, when the 
Wolverines beat Air Force, 29-13, 
holding the Falcons to 232 yards 
of offense.
“That was kind of my starting 
point for everything,” Smith said 
of his notes from that game.
Smith counts himself among 
Don 
Brown’s 
disciples. 
He 
played 
and 
coached 
under 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
coordinator 
at 
University 
of 
Massachusetts before nine years 
in the NFL — a stint that ended 
when Brown pulled him back 
to the college ranks. Many of 
his schemes stem from what 
he learned in all 
those stops under 
Brown.
But 
defending 
the 
triple 
option, he says, 
is 
a 
uniform 
philosophy. 
It’s 
an 
exercise 
in 
discipline 
and 
assignments, 
in 
preparation 
and 
endurance.
“I’ll 
tell 
you 
one thing, any time you see one 
of the (service) academies on 
the schedule, you sure don’t 
get excited, facing the triple 
option, just being honest with 
you,” Smith told The Daily this 
week. “Because it’s so different. 
And as a player, having played 
against the offense a few times, 
I wouldn’t consider it fun to have 
to go against guys that are trying 

to cut block you every snap.”
For Rice, the task was made 
easier by opening their season 
with Army, giving them double 
the time to prepare. Michigan 
didn’t have that luxury — Jim 
Harbaugh and his staff started 
working on their preparations 
during 
spring 
practices 
to 
compensate.
“I think the biggest thing you 
really need to focus on is getting 
your scout team 
ready, just from 
a 
coaching 
standpoint 
to 
be able to get a 
good look from 
the scout team,” 
Smith 
said. 
“Because they’re 
going to be doing 
things 
that 
they’re not used 
to doing.
“And if you can 
try to simulate as best as you can 
what it’s going to look like during 
the week, it helps the guys be 
more confident going into the 
game.”
Once game time arrives, the 
task shifts from preparation to 
discipline, something that can 
be especially challenging against 
such a unique look. “It’s such a 
spread offensive world now that 

you see the triple option, it’s 
just different,” said Michigan 
defensive line coach Shaun Nua.
The basic principle of the 
option is the same as the spread 
offense: get talented players in 
space with room to work. That’s 
where the similarities end.
If 
the 
offense 
takes 
the 
first read — a handoff to the 
running back — the defense’s 
responsibilities are no different 
than in any other scheme. But 
if the quarterback keeps the 
ball, assignments take over. One 
player, usually a linebacker, is 
responsible for the quarterback 
on a given play. Another is the 
“pitch player,” responsible for 
the third option. A mistake from 
either of those players can spell 
disaster.
“Say your quarterback player 
does something undisciplined 
and say he goes for the dive, he 
tries to go and tackle the (third 
option), then you’ve got no 
quarterback player,” Smith said. 
“Same with the pitch player, if 
he goes and tries to tackle the 
quarterback, then you have no 
pitch player.”
The 
importance 
of 
that 
discipline 
only 
magnifies 
as 
the game progresses. Army’s 
run percentage stands above 
85 percent each of the past 

three years. That wears down 
a 
defense, 
compromising 
its 
focus as the repetition can numb 
defensive players’ minds.
Last week, Smith saw that 
firsthand, 
with 
his 
defense 
undoing three quarters of good 
work by allowing a 18-play, 
96-yard touchdown drive deep 
in the fourth quarter.
“They keep doing the same 
thing over and over again to try 
to lull you to sleep,” Smith said. 
“And the DBs, they’re supposed 
to read their keys every play. And 
they may try to get a jump on the 
run game because they’ve been 
seeing the same thing over and 
over again. So instead of reading 
the keys, they stop reading their 
keys and start just playing run-
first. And now, next thing you 
know, you give up a big play 
because one guy doesn’t do his 
assignment.”
Still, 
Smith 
trusts 
Brown 
better than anyone to prepare 
his defense to overcome these 
hurdles.
He remembers playing in the 
1998 FCS national championship 
game, 
when 
Brown 
coached 
UMass past Georgia Southern, 
led by Paul Johnson, who Smith 
calls the “godfather” of the 
modern triple-option offense. 
Johnson’s 
highest-profile 
job 

came as head coach of Georgia 
Tech from 2008-18, but his 
coaching tree permeates nearly 
every 
triple-option 
team 
in 
Division I.
Among that coaching tree? 
Army coach Jeff Monken.
