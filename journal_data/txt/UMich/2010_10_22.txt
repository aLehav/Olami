Two suspects, who fired gun-
shots during an armed robbery
at Bank of America's Eisenhower
branch at the
intersection First seen on
of Eisenhow-

and Packard
Street yesterday morning, are still
at large, Ann Arbor police con-
firmed as of publication at 2:15 a.m.
this morning.
The armed robbery occurred at
about 10:15 a.m. yesterday morn-
ing. The two suspects arrived in a
stolen vehicle that was taken ear-
lier yesterday morning from Pitts-
field, Mich., Sgt. Craig Flocken of
the Ann Arbor Police Department
said last night.
"We're still investigating,"
Flocken said. "They're still out."
According to Flocken, "an unde-
termined amount of cash was
obtained."
After the robbery, the suspects
fled on foot from the bank, which

will speak at
event in Rackham
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Former President Bill Clinton
will be comingto campus on Sun-
day to speak at a rally in support of
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich),
who is running for re-election on
Nov. 2.
The rally, called "Get Out the

Vote," will be held at 2 p.m. .at
Rackham Auditorium, according
to a press release issued by Ding-
ell's campaign last night.
Betsy Barrett, communications
director for Dingell's campaign,
wrote in an e-mail interview last
night that campaign officials
chose to host the rally at the Uni-
versity because of its politically
active atmosphere.
"U of M is a great institution
with an energetic student body
and a first-rate faculty and staff,"
Barrett wrote. "It is also a fun
place to hold a rally."

Barrett added that Sunday's
event will be one in a long his-
tory of Dingell campaigning with
national political figures.
"Barack Obama, Bill Clinton,
Ted Kennedy, and many others
have campaigned with Congress-
man Dingell in Michigan," Bar-
rett wrote.
Interview requests to Clinton's
communications staff went unan-
swered last night.
Though the 84-year-old Ding-
ell is the longest-serving member
in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives - having held his seat since

1955 - his re-election campaign
hasn't been entirely smooth sail-
ing.
An Oct. 4 poll conducted by the
Rossman Group, which identifies
as nonpartisan, showed Dingell's
opponent, Rob Steele, the Repub-
lican candidate and an Ann Arbor
cardiologist, leading Dingell by a
43.8-percent to 39.5-percent mar-
gin.
But in an e-mail interview
last week, Barrett wrote that the
Rossman Group has ties to the
Republican Party.

Spike in food carts
due to quick return
on small investment,
cart owners say
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Students looking to pick up a
quick bite on their way to class
can now choose from a variety of
options ranging from hot dogs to
crepes thanks to a fast-growing
array of food carts occupying Ann
Arbor sidewalks.
According to owners distribut-
ing the food on and around cam-
pus, the carts are sproutingup all
over the city in large part because

of the low overhead cost involved
in running them. And though
snowy Michigan winters may
seem like an obstacle for the food
cart industry, owners say they
plan to weather the cold.
The City of Ann Arbor requires
food carts to have an application
approved by the Police Depart-
ment, complete with a sidewalk
occupancy application, photo
of the cart, Health Department
certificate and proof of liability
insurance.
Sebastian Estalada, who owns
Hot Dogs on the Run - a cart sta-
tioned at the edge of the Diag on
SouthUniversityAvenue-saidthe
business requires a small invest-
ment, but provides a quick return.
Estalada has had food carts in
Ann Arbor for 11 years. This year

he has one cart, but he said he
plans to expand to four carts next
year.
His food cart, which sells hot
dogs, sausages and kielbasas, is
out every weekday from 9 a.m.to
4 p.m. In the winter, the business
sells hot items like coffee, Esta-
lada said.
Jake Waldecker, owner of
Smokey Jake's BBQ - which is
located in front of the Union -
said the hours and flexibility of
owning his own business are per-
fect for him because it gives him
a chance to work only while his
daughter is in school.

in business for about a month,
and Waldecker said he plans to

Iraqi leaders not following U.S. advice on gov't

After American
troops pull out,'
Iraqis seek advice
from Iran
BAGHDAD (AP) - American
influence has so dwindled in Iraq
over the last several months that
Iraqi lawmakers and political
leaders say they no longer follow
Washington's advice for forming a
government.
Instead, Iraqis are turning to
neighboring nations, and especially
Iran, for guidance - casting doubt
on the future of the American role
in this strategic country after a
grinding war that killed more than
4,400 U.S. soldiers.
"The Iraqi politicians are not
responding to the U.S. like before.
We don't pay great attention to
them," Shiite lawmaker Sami al-
Askari, a close ally of Prime Minis-
ter Nouri al-Maliki, said yesterday.
"The weak American role has given
the region's countries a greater
sense of influence on Iraqi affairs."
Vice President Joe Biden, the
administration's point man for Iraq,
has doggedly lobbied Iraqi leaders,
both on the phone and in six trips
here over the past two years.
Iraqis, however, measure U.S.
influence largely by its military
presence, which dipped by three-
fold from the war's peak to 50,000
troops in late August. As a result,
Baghdad is now brushing off U.S.
urgings to slow-walk a new gov-
ernment instead of rushing one
through that might cater to Iran.

"The Iranian ambassador has a
bigger role in Iraq than Biden," said
a prominent Kurdish lawmaker,
Mahmoud Othman. He said the
Americans "will leave Iraq with its
problems, thus their influence has
become weak."
One problem which could
worsen as a result is the sectarian
divide - particularly if the secular
but Sunni-backed Iraqiya political
coalition, which won the most votes
in the March election, is left out of
a new Shiite-led government led by
al-Maliki.
Many Iraqis, particularly minor-
ity Sunnis, would view such a
government as "blessed by Iran
and evidence of America's rela-
tive weakness," analyst Michael
Knights wrote on the website of
The Washington Institute for Near
East Policy. This perception could
lead to a surge in violence.
Washington, which has its hands
full with the war in Afghanistan
and the hunt in Pakistan for Osama
bin Laden, sees Iraq as "the bane
of everyone's existence lately," said
one senior administration official
who spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because of the sensitivity of the
diplomatic issues.
But Iraq cannot afford to ignore
completely what Washington
wants. For one, that could bring the
end of U.S. help and financial back-
ing to broker $13 billion worth of
contracts for military equipment.
It also would all but dash any
hopes by Baghdad to re-negotiate
a security agreement that is set to
expire at the end of 2011 - a needed
step to keeping some U.S. forces in
Iraq to continue training its fledg-

ling air force and protect its bor-
ders. A senior Iraqi military official
predicted the new government,
once it is settled, ultimately will
ask U.S. troops to remain beyond
next year.
U.S. alliances with Mideast
nations to which Baghdad seeks
to cozy up also cement American
influence in Iraq, said Salman Shai-
kh, director of the Brookings Doha
Center think tank in Doha.
"In that, I think the U.S. is still
pretty well positioned in terms
of getting its voice heard in Iraq,"
Shaikh said. But he agreed that the
U.S. carries less sway in Baghdad
than it used to: "If it was such an
easy thing to exert influence, then
wouldn't Iraq have had a govern-
ment by now?"
More than seven months have
passed since March 7 parliamenta-
ry elections failed to produce clear
winners, and Iraqi politicians say
they will pick new leaders on their
own timetable.
Othman said the lengthy
impasse, despite heavy U.S. pres-
sure to form a government that
includes all of Iraq's major politi-
cal players, shows that Baghdad
doesn't really care what Washing-
ton wants.
"Yes, the Americans have their
view on how to form an Iraqi gov-
ernment," Askari agreed. "But it
does not apply to the political pow-
ers on the ground and it is not effec-
tive."
U.S. officials initiallyencouraged
the Iraqis to form a government
quickly, but recently started push-
ing for a slowdown after it became
apparent that a party led by anti-

CLINTON
From Page 1
"This is a GOP poll conducted by
a firm with GOP ties masquerading
as an independent poll, but it's too
early for trick or treats," she wrote.
A new Detroit Free Press-WXYZ
TV poll released yesterday, how-
ever, revealed that Dingell holds
a 17-point lead over Steele, who's
apparently trailing Dingell at 36
percent compared to Dingell's 53

percent, according to an Oct. 21
Free Press article.
In 2008, Dingell beat Republican
challenger John Lynch by a 70-per-
cent to 25-percent margin, accord-
ing to the article. The last time
Dingell received less than 60 per-
cent of the vote was in 1994 when
the GOP took control of both cham-
bers of Congress - he garnered
59 percent of the vote that year,
according to the Free Press article.
Brendan Campbell, chair of the
University's chapter of College

Democrats, said in an interview last
night that he hopes Clinton's visit
will encourage students to vote for
Dingell and other Democrats so
that the party "(keeps) moving this
country forward."
"Clinton recognizes that Ann'
Arbor and especially the University
of Michigan campus is a stronghold
for Democrats across the state, so
turning up Democrats in this area
and making sure that students are
specifically excited for this elec-
tion has deep ramifications for the

entire state," Campbell said.
Campbell added that his group is
excited that an "icon in the Demo-
cratic Party" will be coming to
campus to speak directly to stu-
dents about their role in this year's
midterm election.
"We know that two years ago
students and young people came
out in a huge way for Barack
Obama and the Democratic Party
and we really need to do that again
in 2010 to make sure that we con-
tinue moving this country in the

right direction," he said. "So I
expect that he's going to talk about
why this election is important, but
also, and more specifically, why
students are important to this
election."
Sunday's event is open to the
public, but tickets are required
for admittance. Tickets can be
reserved online on Dingell's cam-
paign website and picked up before
the event at the Rackham Audito-
riumbox office.
In addition to visiting the Uni-

versity, Clinton will also travel to
Detroit and Battle Creek, Mich. on
Sunday with several Democratic
candidates - including Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Virg Ber-
nero. Currently the mayor of Lan-
sing, Bernero is expected to speak
with Clinton at Fellowship Chapel
in Detroit, according to The Associ-
ated Press.

Autopsies on shot
bank president yield
differing results
Macomb County authorities
acknowledge that an independent
autopsy showing a Michigan bank
president was shot in the head con-
tradicts one done earlier claiming
no evidence of blunt force.
County Sheriff Mark Hackel told
WWJ-AM yesterday the discrep-
ancy between an original autopsy
performed by Macomb County
medical examiner Daniel Spitz and
one performed by his equivalent,
L.J. Dragovic, in neighboring Oak-
land County, is "unfortunate," and
delayed a search of Lake St. Clair
where 62-year-old David Widlak's
body was found Sunday.
Police on Wednesday found a
handgun they believe fired the fatal
shot. Hackel said no suspects have
been identified and suicide has not
been ruled out, but the case is being
treated as a homicide.
ROSEVILLE, Calif.
Man arrested after
setting California
mall on fire
A high-end regional mall that is
one of the main retail centers in a
broad swath of Northern Califor-
nia was set ablaze yesterday after
police arrested a man who had bar-
ricaded himself inside, dealing an
economic blow to a region strug-
gling to emerge from the recession.
City officials said part of the roof
on the mall's south end collapsed as
huge clouds of black smoke poured
from the 1.3 million-square-foot
Roseville Galleria, which is about
17 miles east of the state capital.
No injuries were reported, but
damage to the mall's roof appeared
extensive.
The mall was evacuated earlier in
the day after a man barricaded him-
self inside a shop and started what
appeared at first to be a small fire.
Authorities had thought the
mall's sprinkler system doused
the blaze. Before the larger blaze
erupted, police had detained a sus-
pect and were checking a backpack
they found to see if it contained
explosives.
Police later said the fire began
spreading as members of the bomh
sqiad were examining the back-
pack, forcing them to flee the build-
ing.
WASHINGTON
Dems allocate $1M
for ads in Spanish
to mobilize voters
National Democrats plan to
spend $1 million on Spanish-lan-
guage ads to motivate a key seg-
ment of the party's coalition to
vote.
The Democratic National Com-
mittee said yesterday that it would
start airing ads in Spanish featur-
ing President Barack Obama as the
party tries to defend their majori-
ties in the House and Senate. The

party said the ad effort is its largest
ever in Hispanic paid media.
Obama speaks in Spanish in one
radio spot and says he needs voters'

SINGAPORE
Football player may
be subject to caning
A former Florida State Univer-
sity football player may become
the first American in 16 years to
be caned in Singapore after he
overstayed his visa, his lawyer
said yesterday.
Kamari Charlton, who was a
reserve tight end for Florida State
from 1992 to 1996, was arrested
Sept. 1 when he attempted to leave
the city-state 169 days after his
90-day social visit pass expired,
attorney M. Ravi said.
Charlton, who was born in the
Bahamas and owns a construction
company there, was in Singapore
while his wife received medical
care for pregnancy complications,
Ravi said. It was not clear why
Charlton and his wife chose Sin-
gapore for medical treatment.
Staying in Singapore more than
90 days after the end of a visa is
punishable with a maximum jail
term of six months and at least
three cane strokes.

U.S. diplomats to
pressure Karzai
to reverse ban on
private security

FRANCIS IPOCKEt/AP
Attorney Dan Woods, right, speaks to the media at the United States District Court in Riverside, Calif., after making arguments
on the U.S. military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tel" policy on Monday. Woods represents the plaintiffs, the Log Cabin Republicans.
GOP gay rights -group fighs
'don't ask, don't tell' policy

Iraq war vet leads
19,000 Republicans
against repeal
SAN DIEGO (AP) - When he
left the Bush administration in
2009, Clarke R. Cooper decided
he had to raise his voice.
The decorated Iraq war veter-
an had been serving in the Army,
with some in his unit aware that
he was gay. And yet, he said, no
one had ever tried to get the offi-
cer discharged under the mili-
tary's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
"This is not an example of why
the policy works, it's an example
of why it is broken," he said.
Two years later, Cooper finds
himself leading a 19,000-member
group for gay Republicans that
has managed to accomplish what
its fellow gay rights activists on
the left have not - bring the 1993
Clinton-era law closer than it has
ever been to being abolished.
A federal judge ruled last
month in a lawsuit brought by
the Log Cabin Republicans in
2004 that the ban on openly gay
troops was unconstitutional, and
ordered the Pentagon to stop its
enforcement. An appeals court
has temporarily frozen that order
while it Considers a government
request to suspend it pending an
appeal of the case.
Even getting this far hasn't
been easy for Cooper or the Log
Cabin Republicans.
They have never been entirely
embraced within the gay rights
movement, which generally finds
a more receptive audience in Dem-
ocrats. Many in the movement
viewed the group's six-year quest
to overturn the policy as quixotic.
"I heard that repeatedly. I
heard that as recently as seven
months ago, people saying this
case didn't have a prayer," said
Christopher Barron, the Log
Cabin Republican's former politi-

cal director and the founder of a
rival group for gay conservatives.
The liberal gay rights groups'
approach to ending the ban in
2004 involved suing on behalf of
one sympathetic service member
at a time, while they also lob-
bied Congress to overturn the
law. Some advocates also cringed
at the idea of joining forces with
Republicans.
They "saw the Log Cabins as
people,.frankly, who want their
taxes cut and are willing to affili-
ate with a party that is grossly
anti-gay because of that," said
Aaron Belkin, executive direc-
tor of the Palm Center, a think
tank on gays and the military at
the University of California Santa
Barbara who was an expert in
their case.
The Justice Department tried
to block the Log Cabin Republi-
can's lawsuit from going to trial,
arguing that the organization
did not have members who were
directly affected by the policy.
The group initially filed its law-
suit on behalf of John Does and
said they were active military
members who could not be identi-
fied for fear of being discharged.
The group later named gay vet-
eran Alexander Nicholson as a
plaintiff to better its chances.
In its 2004 lawsuit, the group
ended up arguingthatthe ban vio-
lated the First Amendment, asso-
ciation and due process rights of
its members and sought its imme-
diate demise.
"To the extent there were
people who were upset I think it
was because they didn't know in
advance that Log Cabin was going
to sue," said Jon Davidson, execu-
tive director of Lambda Legal, a
gay rights legal affairs group.
Patrick Guerriero, who was
Log Cabin's president from 2003
to 2006 and is now registered as
an independent, recalled how it
wasn't just liberal gay activists
who objected. Fellow Republi-

cans also were upset by "a lawsuit
against the U.S. military, against
Bush's Department of Defense."
Guerriero said the group was
compelled to act after receiving
letters, calls and e-mails from gay
service members in Iraq discuss-
ing the difficulty of having to be
pretend to be who they weren't.
At the time, Republicans were
debating whether to pass a con-
stitutional amendment barring
same-sex marriage.
"People forget the climate we
were in. There was no legislative
road map," he said. "We thought it
was important to have it be non-
partisan and even have a Repub-
lican angle to it, that that would
send a more powerful message to
the courts and perhaps Congress."
Cooper, who became president
of the group two months before
the trial began this summer
before Judge Virginia Phillips
in Riverside, Calif., said he was
always optimistic. "There's been
a general cultural shift that's
been helpful tous," he said.
Phillips' ruling catapulted
the group to the forefront of the
fight and put President Barack
Obama in the position of facing
off with a Republican organiza-
tion challenging a law he, too,
opposes. Obama supports a legis-
lative repeal, but it sfalled in the
Senate this fall.
Cooper said the fight shows
Republicans are not always the
enemy. "I'm not going to deny the
fact that there have been years
and times when the Republican
party has not been friendly to
the gay voter," he said, "but that's
changing."
He said he has shared his secret
with his closest Army friends
and keeps it quiet around oth-
ers whom he feels do not need to
know. And he pointed out that
President George W. Bush knew
his sexual orientation when the
39-year-old Army captain se'rved
under him.

Security ban will go
into effect in
mid-December
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration is scram-
bling to avert a crisis over a ban
on private security companies in
Afghanistan that could force the
cancellation or delay of billions of
dollars in reconstruction projects
considered vital to counterterror-
ism efforts, officials said yester-
day.
U.S. diplomats are preparing
for a weekend of tough nego-
tiations with Afghan President
Hamid Karzai and his aides to
persuade them to revise the ban
that, as it now stands, would bar
private security guards from pro-
tecting non-governmental and
nonmilitary facilities in Afghani-
stan, the officials said. The ban is
set to take effect in mid-Decem-
ber.
"As is, if this was to be enact-
ed tomorrow, a lot of assistance
would grind to a halt," said one
senior U.S. official familiar with
the circumstances. That official
and others spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were
not authorized to speak publicly
about the sensitive issue.
The Washington Post report-
ed yesterday that the ban could
impact about $1.5 billion in U.S.-
funded projects in Afghanistan.
But the officials said the impact
likely would befar greater, affect-
ing billions of dollars in foreign-

funded initiatives from road,
bridge and school construction
projects to teaching and agricul-
ture initiatives.
"All private and private sector
assistance would be hit, not just
U.S.-funded projects," one official
said, noting that about 80 percent
of British-funded projects could
be affected.
The officials said some com-
panies, notably Bethesda, Md.-
based Development Alternatives
Inc. that runs projects to sup-
port local governance, already
have begun to implement con-
tingency plans to draw down
their operations in anticipation
of the ban.
Even if the ban is eventually
revised, such drawdowns may
cause serious delays in restarting
projects, they said.
"If there is toomuchuncertain-
ty in the interim, given the risks
involved, a lot of people are going
to get very nervous and leave,"
the senior U.S. official said. "Our
development partners are getting
more and more nervous. If they
are not sure what's going to hap-
pen, they are going to start draw-
ing down."
The official expressed hope
that a resolution could be worked
out in meetings set for the week-
end. "No one wants the level of
disruption that we will see if we
reach the worst-case scenario,"
he said.
The Obama administration
supports Karzai's goal of over-
hauling the private security
industry in Afghanistan.

Remains of WWII era
Japanese soldiers found

Up to 2,000 bodies
found on Iwo Jima
TOKYO (AP) - Two mass
graves that may hold the remains
of up to 2,000 Japanese soldiers
have been discovered on the
island of Iwo Jima, one of the
bloodiest and most iconic battle-
sites of World War II, a report and
officials said today.
A team of Japanese searchers
has discovered 51 remains in two
areas listed by the U.S. military
after the war as enemy cemeter-
ies, one of which could contain
as many as 2,000 bodies, Japan's
Kyodo news agency said today.
The team was to reportits find-
ings later today to the prime min-
ister's office.
Officials at Japan's health min-
istry, which supervises search
efforts on the remote island, con-
firmed that 51 bodies had been
recovered and two sites believed
to be burial grounds had been
found. But they could not imme-
diately confirm the potential size
of the massgraves or other details
of the Kyodo report.
The discovery of the remains

would be one of the biggestbreak-
throughs in decades toward find-
ing the bodies of roughly 12,000
Japanese who remain missing
and presumed dead after the 1945
battle on the island, which has
been renamed Iwoto by the Japa-
nese government.
The island was seen as key to
the United States because it had
three airfields that could be used
to launch raids on Tokyo and
Japan's main islands.
Virtually all of the 22,000
Japanese soldiers tasked with
defending the rugged, volcanic
crag were killed in the battle,
which became a symbol and ral-
lying point for the United States
in the Pacific war after the U.S.
flag was raised on its highest
ground, Mount Suribachi.
The battle claimed 6,821Amer-
ican and 21,570 Japanese lives.
Dozens of remains are recovered
every year, but about 12,000 Jap-
anese are still classified as miss-
ing in action and presumed killed
on the island, along with 218
Americans.

but Iwo Jima was not declared
secured until March 26.

Toyota recalls 1.5M more cars

Break-fluid and
fuel-pump problems
cause recall
DETROIT (AP) - Just when
Toyota thought its safety prob-
lems were over, they flare up all
over again.
Less than a year after it was
tarnished by reports of runaway
cars, the automaker recalled
1.5 million vehicles yesterday
to address brake-fluid and fuel-
pump troubles, drawing new
attention to safety issues that
have festered inside the company
for years.
The world's No. 1 carmaker
said there were no accidents or
injuries connected to the latest
recall, which covers some Lexus
and Toyota models from the 2004
to 2006 model years, mostly in
the U.S. and Japan.
For Toyota, the latest recalls
hurt the company's image just as
it tries to clear up old problems,
said Jean-Pierre Dube, a market-
ing professor at the University of
Chicago.
Some previous braking and
acceleration problems were
blamed on driver error, he noted,
but these problems were because
of deterioration of parts.
"This is starting to look more
like a chronic problem for them,"
he said. "It's hard to imagine this
can't have some effect on how
consumers are going to perceive
the Toyota brand and to what
extent it represents reliability."
Safety experts said it was an
example of a new Toyota scram-

blingt o clean up messes from
its past. Toyota started getting
reports of brake-fluid leaks in
some of its models in February
2005, and it took more than five
years to issue the recall.
Toyota has now recalled more
than 11 million cars and trucks
around the world over the past
year for problems including
faulty gas pedals, floor mats that
can trap accelerators, braking
problems and stalling engines.
Toyota took a hit on its once-
impeccable reputation, not to
mention its sales. This time
around, it chose to recall rather
than stonewall, said Clarence
Ditlow, president of the Center for
Auto Safety, a consumer group.
"The company is looking at all
of these older defects and making
a decision to do a recall, which
they wouldn't have done in their
pre-sudden-acceleration mental-
ity," he said.
While insisting that it never
swept safety issues under the
rug, spokesman Brian Lyons said
the company is reacting far more
quickly than it had in the past.
"That is part of our commit-
ment to the federal regulators
and our customers," he said. The
government said it had received
three related complaints since
2004.
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration hit Toyota
with a $16.4 million fine earlier
this year for failing to promptly
tell the government about defects
in its cars.
The new recalls affect 740,000
cars in the U.S. and 599,000 in
Japan. The rest are in Europe

and elsewhere around the world.
Honda Motor Co. also said it
would recall an undetermined
number of vehicles because of the
same brake issue.
Since the safety problems hit
the news last fall, Toyota's U.S.
sales have lagged behind the rest
of the industry despite numerous
incentives toland customers.
For the first nine months of
this year, Toyota sales were up 1.4
percent. Overall U.S. auto sales
increased more than 10 percent.
Toyota spent more than $2,100
per car on incentives in Septem-
ber, up from about $1,500 a year
ago - and at a time when the rest
of the auto industry was spending
less to woo customers.
Rebates and low-interest deals
were unusual for Toyota in the
past, but incentives were neces-
sary to win back customers after
the recalls, said Jesse Toprak,
vice president of industry trends
for Truecar.com.
"It's a process that's not going
to be fixed overnight, but all they
can do right now is damage con-
trol," he said.
Toprak added that Lexus'
inclusion in the recall could hurt
the company's ability to fend
off Mercedes-Benz as the best-
selling luxury brand in the Unit-
ed States this year. Lexus was
behind Mercedes by about 3,000
vehicles through September.
Toyota's global profits were
hurt by the recalls. The company
earned an unusually low $1.2 bil-
lion from January to March. Its
profits have since recovered, and
it made $2.2 billion from April
through June.

Legislation on the rocks
State should override governor's veto of liquor bill
W ith an already-tight budget, ebbing tax revenue and
a lack of business growth, Michigan is in no position
to deny legislation that would increase state revenue.
But on Oct. 12, Gov. Jennifer Granholm did exactly that when she
vetoed a bill altering the sale of liquor that would have paid an
estimated $500,000 into the state's general fund. The liquor bill
would have been an easy fix to bring in added revenue needed to
fund higher education and unemployment benefits, and repeal
an antiquated law. To give the state's pocketbook a much-needed
boost, the Michigan legislature must either reintroduce the bill
or overturn Granholm's veto.

Video games and crap for brains

The liquor bill approved by the state
legislature in late September would have
expanded the hours when liquor can be
sold. According to an Oct. 13 article in The
Detroit News, retailers would be permit-
ted to sell alcohol from 7 a.m. on Sundays
until 2 a.m. Monday with the purchase of
a special $160 permit. It also increased
the hours that liquor sales are allowed on
Christmas, allowing for purchase after
midnight on Christmas Eve and noon on
Christmas day. The bill included provi-
sions allowing for beer and wine tastings
at grocery stores, alcoholic beverages to
be served at restaurant-catered events
and for community colleges to use alcohol
for culinary classes. Granholm has stated
that though she is in favor of extended sale
hours, she didn't approve of the other pro-
visions, which is why she vetoed the bill.
The governor's veto will prove hurt-
ful to both the state and small businesses.
The legislature has already been forced to
cut spending across the board - the esti-
mated $500,000 in revenue could have
funded some valuable programs. As noted
in yesterday's editorial from the Daily, the
funding could have been directed toward
stabilizing unemployment insurance ben-
efits. And small businesses will now lose
out on profit that could have been made

from sales during the extended hours. In
this uncertain economy, any chance to
increase profits is valuable for struggling
businesses.
Granholm's decision also keeps in place
an antiquated, paternalistic law that was
designed to promote puritanical Chris-
tian morality in legislation. Laws like this,
often called blue laws, while seemingly
unimportant, limit citizens' personal free-
doms. Granholm needs to recognize that
ideals about the use of alcohol shouldn't be
thrust upon citizens by the state.
The legislature needs to recall the eco-
nomic benefits of this bill and put it back
on the table. Granholm stated that she
would be willing to work with legislators to
rework the bill. Due to the Nov. 2 elections,
however, many are unwilling to revisit
the topic during a lame-duck session. But
that shouldn't stop legislators. Granholm
shouldn't have vetoed the bill in the first
place - now, the legislature shouldn't stop
supporting such a beneficial change.
Extending the hours of liquor sales
would not only help businesses, but also
help cut away at a large deficit. Whether
legislators introduce the bill again or gath-
er the required votes to override the gover-
nor's veto, they should find a way see this
bill turned into law.

today's column, WILL
we will explore GRUNDLER
what link - or
links - between
,Neanderthals and
modern-day men causes such unin-
telligent aggression toward innocent
televisions.
I'm joking, of course. I'm not a
geneticist. And some people are just
really stupid, like - my housemates.
(Note to English majors: Don't just
write about what you know. Write
about WHO you know, and then
threaten to publish their names along
with it. This will probably make more
money than writing in the long run.)
The situation in my house is
becoming intolerable, if you want to
know the truth. If you don't want to
know the truth, this column is good
for that, too. Anyway, all my house-
mates do is play Xbox games like
"Red Dead Redemption," in which
you go around killing people and
horses in the Old West. You can even
skin a horse, if you want to, which of
course they want to.'
Housemate: "Hey, watch me skin
this horse!"
Me: "What is WRONG with you?"
They also play "Call of Duty 4:
Modern Warfare," in which, as the
title suggests, you go around killing
terrorists in a modern and humane
way. You can even radio in big planes

and helicopters to transport injured
terrorists to hospitals, I think. Or
maybe the planes just bomb them. I
can't remember - it's all very stupid.
The most annoying game - even
more annoying than killing horses
and terrorists - is FIFA soccer. Good
god is it aggravating. Not so much the
game, but my housemates' wild reac-
tions to it. Here is a typical conversa-
tion when a goal is about to be scored:
"Woah."
"Woab!"
"Ooooh!"
"OOOOOOH!"
"OOOOOOH!"
"WOOOOOOAH!?!"
This usually takes place at one in
the morning and is not a conversation
that normal people have. It's the kind
of conversation that the ape-men in
"2001: A Space Odyssey" have when
they discover tools and go and kill
some other ape-men.
My housemates would tell a differ-
ent story, no doubt. If you could hear'
their side, you would hear something
like, "Hey, don't listen to this hotshot
columnist! He is very good-looking,
and funny, and we will be calling
him for money in the future because
he will become rich and famous, but
he just uses the TV to watch trashy
B-movies like 'Spring Break Shark
Attack!"'
This is entirely untrue, of course. I
TRIED to watch "Spring Break Shark
Attack" but the idiots wouldn't let
me. They have complete sovereignty
over the TV.
But that's not the issue here. The
issue here is that there's a right and
a wrong way to waste your time.
The right way includes things like
watching bad movies on purpose for
comic effect, like "Cocktail" with
Tom Cruise. It means singing popu-
lar songs with offensive lyrics in
place of the real ones. And discover-
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

ing obscure and bizarre videos on
YouTube. (Search "world of chemis-
try rod and balls.") Drugs. All these
activities stimulate the brain in posi-
tive ways and can be brought up at
parties. ("Have you seen 'Cocktail'?"
"Do you have drugs?" It's simple.)
'Red Dead is
the wrong way to
waste time.
The wrong way includes playing
video games. And the Michigan Quid-
ditch club, but that's another column.
Good lord. Anyway. How manyvirtual
goals canyouscore? How many terror-
ists can you shoot? How many horses
can you skin? It's meaningless. Try to
talk about it with a friend, or bring it
up at a party. Not that my housemates
go to parties anymore. Our next-door
neighbors threw a party and they
stayed at home to play FIFA.
I'm afraid it's too late to save them.
This column is really a last resort. If
you or your friends are acquainted
with Walker McHugh, Tim Pituch,
Jeff "The Sloth" Sorensen or Ryan
Aliapoulios (don't bother trying to
pronounce that one), please inform
them of your concern for their health.
They're, not busy, they don't have
funerals to go to, etc. They are just
playing Xbox. And if this plea is suc-
cessful - if they lay down their con-
trollers - I will provide, at only $5
a head, a screening of "Spring Break
Shark Attack" to all those who helped.

"Alfonzo, one of my eighth grade students,
wrote to me that he wants to be a doctor.
Alfonzo spent the past two years in the middle
school where I now work - one of the lowest
performing middle schools in Baltimore City.
As a result, he reads on a fifth grade level and
has difficulty thinking critically. Although
Alfonzo is bright and hard-working, he may
not graduate high school on time, let alone
make it to medical school, simply because of
where he was born."
Lindsay Miars, a University alum and Teach
For America corps member, is currently teach-
ing eighth grade language arts at a middle
school in Baltimore, Maryland. She is the only
language arts teacher in the middle school.
Miars's students, who are performing well
below grade level, are unfortunately typical
victims of a broken education system in which
students in low-income communities signifi-
cantly underperform compared to their more
affluent peers.
This academic achievement gap is one of
our nation's greatest social injustices. Unfor-
tunately, a child's place of birth has become a
powerful factor in determining the quality of
education he or she will receive. In fact, only
1 in 10 children who grow up in low-income
communities graduate from college. This is
unacceptable. In the so-called "land of oppor-
tunity," nothing is more fundamental than pro-
viding a quality education for each and every
child, regardless of where they happen to live.
Teach For America is leading the movement
against educational inequity, and we need the
help of University of Michigan students to
address this problem. We have an obligation to
ensure that future generations of Americans
have the tools and opportunities needed to
achieve academic success, regardless of their
racial or socioeconomic background.
The persistence of the achievement gap is
painfully obvious - even in our own backyard.
Though only 40 miles separate Ann Arbor and
Detroit, there is an enormous disparity stu-
dents from these two districts. Accordingto the
Ann Arbor Public School website, "Over 96% of
third graders and 93% of seventh graders met or
exceeded state standards in math. Also, 91% of
third graders and 91% of seventh graders met or
exceeded state standards in reading."
While Ann Arbor Public Schools have been
extremely successful, the Detroit Public School
system is struggling. According to Teach For
America, "Detroit's academic achievement is
among the lowest for major U.S. cities - only
three percent of Detroit's fourth-graders and
four percent of its eighth graders meet national

math standards. As an example, test scores sug-
gest that only one in three of Detroit fourth-
graders can correctly subtract 75 from 301, even
when given a choice of three multiple-choice
answers." A proper education system cannot
simply cater to children in higher income neigh-
borhoods. Every student is entitled to an excel-
lent education regardless of his or her zip code.
Teach For America is working to close the
achievement gap by enlisting college gradu-
ates to commit two years to teaching in a low-
income community in one of 41 regions across
the country. Within these communities, Teach
For America corps members make a dramatic
difference in the lives of their students, aca-
demically and beyond. Corps members receive
full salary and benefits as employees of their
school district and also have access to loan-for-
bearance programs that help make Teach For
America a financially viable option for recent
college graduates.
Many college students have never consid-
ered a teaching career. Many are also under the
impression that without a major in education,
they are unqualified to apply for Teach For
America, which isn't the case. In fact, while
admission is highly competitive, Teach For
America recruits students from all majors.
Though 39 percent of Teach for America
teachers choose to stay in the classroom, Teach
For America recognizes that after fulfilling
their two-year teaching commitment many
corps members will choose to attend grad
school or enter the private sector rather than
continue with a career in education. Teach
For America seeks to hire individuals who
will become leaders in education as well as
in medicine, business, law, policy, engineer-
ing and other fields. These individuals will
be able to continue advocating for students in
low-income communities in a broader scope in
every professional sector. As America's future
leaders, Teach For America corps members
will soon be in positions of influence, where
they can continue to affectbroad social change.
Together, we can fight educational inequity
and close the achievement gap. If you are inter-
ested, please join us Monday, Oct. 25 for a Teach
For America Alumni Panel, featuring Unversity
and Teach For America alumni from a variety of
academic disciplines at 7:00 p.m. in the Pendle-

The infamous all-nighter

h, the first college all-night-
er. The first caffeine-fueled
panic attacks during which
evenings melt into
mornings withoutA
a blink of an eye
(mostly because
you taped your
eyelids open).
The first of many
nights filled with
more self-pitying
thoughts than all
the years of puber- MELANIE
ty combined. It's KRUVELIS
truly a mystery that
rapper Asher Roth
left these evenings
out when he wrote "I Love College."
It wasn't supposed to come to this.
Schedules had been made. Timeta-
bles had been drawn. The philosophy
essay could be tackled. The Spanish
work could be completed. And yet,
somehow, after 46 nights of some-
what consistent sleep at the Univer-
sity, I had finally made it to the first
all-nighter of my college career.
Like many problems developed
during the college years, the first
stage of my all-nighter began like a
line out of an Alcoholics Anonymous
handbook: denial. "I don't need to
stay up," I thought to myself as the
clock struck one. "I can finish my
homework, no problem."Twenty
minutes later, I found myself passed
out, drooling on the keyboard, with a
half-completed Sporcle game the sole
fruit of my labor. Feeling defeated
and marginally disgusting, I ven-
tured downstairs to the Madrigal
Lounge in East Quad, hoping that
a change of scenery could give the
boost I needed,
Maybe it's like this in every resi-
dence hall (yeah, right), but the occu-
pants of East Quad are truly weirdos.
The most bizarre nightlife scene at
the University isn't late-night Quid-

ditch matches in the Diag or outside
of Necto - it's the parade of night-
crawlers, insomniacs and Adderall
addicts that fill residence hall loung-
es on Tuesday evenings.
There's the nerdy couple that's
more into their calculators than each
other, toiling away at their Calc 4
homework that's not due for another
three weeks. or the girl tucked away
in a corner, blubbering on the phone
to her high school boyfriend with
sobs so strong it's nearly impossible
to tell if she's even speaking English.
And then there are the poor sexiled
souls who spend their evenings either
watching "Glee" on their laptops or
crashing on the stained couches.
But, of course, the main stars of the
3 a.m. show are the procrastinators -
those who spend more time planning
out how to do homework instead of
actually doing it. Swearing to any-
one awake that they work best after
Leno is over, they attempt to regain
a shred of sanity by taking solace in
nature. "This isn't so bad," they think
to themselves. "Bear Grylls said you
should see the sunrise at least once
in your life, right?" Be careful, how-
ever, when identifying a student with
a delayed sense of motivation. Often
the best procrastinators - those
with twitching hands and blood-shot
eyes that you develop from chug-
ging two Red Bulls - are confused
with flat-out stoners who simply sit
in the lounge because: a) they can't
find their room or b) they believe that
they're being incepted and cannot
leave the general area until Leonardo
DiCaprio comes to the rescue.
At any rate, these excursions into
the Twilight Zones of college life
aren't experienced fully until the
shuffle to the 9 a.m. class, a.k.a. the
lecture from hell. If you think it's
hard pulling yourself out of bed on
a normal Wednesday morning, try
doing it after you spend the major-

ity of Tuesday evening blasting Avril
Lavigne ballads as you slave away at
a paper analyzing the Mexican Drug
Wars.
Have you ever
seen an East Quad
lounge at 2 a.m.?
As it turns out, those ugly eve-
nings transition into the ugliest of
mornings. After my first all-nighter,
I found myself getting odd stares
from my classmates during my Span-
ish lecture. Later, an amigo told me I
had been twitching and drooling all
over my workbook as I kept a steady
gaze at the fluorescent lights above
me. I wasn't ostracized by my peers,
thank God, though I did later find
pamphlets for rehabilitation clinics
wedged under my door.
An annoyingly correct devil's advo-
cate may argue that anyone with even
a smidgen of organizational skills
can avoid burning the midnight oil if
she simply does the work instead of
watching reruns of "The Office," fill-
ing out Facebook notes or creating
fake user profiles on eHarmony.com.
But all-nighters aren't merely evenings
of cramming and panicking - it's an
experience to see a part of the world
that no one else really sees on a regular
basis. it may not be beautiful. It may
not be fun, and it may not be...
Sorry, I dosed off. Good thing I
waited until 5 a.m. to start this col-
umn. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to go catch some of The Today
Show before I hit the sack.

Not only does he spread the ball

INDIANA VS. ILLINOIS
The list of teams that Illinois
and Indiana have lost to so far this
season is quite impressive: Mis-
souri, Ohio State, Michigan State,
Michigan. But neither has proven
itself in a victory - with the Fight-
ing Illini's 33-13 win over Penn
State serving as the only excep-
tion.
Based on how well each team
played against inferior competi-
tion, this one could be a shootout.
The Hoosiers have senior quarter-
back Ben Chappell and the nation's
fifth-best passing game, which
highlights veteran receivers Dam-
arlo Belcher, Tandon Doss and Ter-
rence Turner.
And Illinois's run game will
have to counter each Indiana blow,
because the Fighting Illini's pass-
ing game just won't cut it. Only
six FBS teams have a worse aerial
attack.
That's okay, though. Junior run-
ning back Mikel LeShoure slashed
and sprinted his way past defend-
ers in the first six weeks of the sea-
son - running for 680 yards and
three touchdowns.
This one is going to come down
to the play of the defenses. Indiana
has allowed at least 34 points in
each of the past three weeks. And
Illinois slowed down Ohio State
and stuffed Penn State, so that has
to carry some weight - but the
choice is a lesser of two evils.

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
After leaving New Hampshire
last weekend with a 3-3 overtime
tie to the ninth-ranked Wildcats,
Michigan coach Red Berenson
and the fourth-
ranked Wol-
verines have an UNO at
opportunity to Michigan
make a statement
on their home Matchup:
ice with another UNO 4-0-0;
chance at defeat- 2Michgan
ing a top-10 team.
Michigan (2-0- When: Fri-
0 CCHA, 2-0-2 day 7 P.M.
overall) takes on Where: Yost
No. 10 Nebraska- Ice Arena
Omaha in its first
home series of the year this Friday
and Saturday. The Mavericks (2-0-
O WCHA, 4-0-0 overall) walk into
Ann Arbor with their heads held
high, coming off a weekend sweep
of then-No. 13 Minnesota in Min-
neapolis.
"We don't know yet what kind
of a home team we're going to be,"
Berenson said after practice on
Thursday. "But you're seeing some
of these good teams now win on the
road. We hope to win on the road
too, but one of our goals is to win
at home. We've got to take advan-
tage of home ice, that's huge and it's
going to be a good challenge."
The Wolverine offense was
strong last Saturday, as the power

play was a perfect 3-for-3 against
New Hampshire. But the Wol-
verines couldn't put New Hamp-
shire away, despite having the lead
three times in the road matchup.
Defensive improvement is key for
the Wolverines this weekend, as
Nebraska-Omaha is tied for first in
the nation in total offense, averag-
ing 5.50 goals per game.
The Mavericks have two senior
forwards who are atop the nation
statistically in goal scoring and
assists. Rich Purslow is in a three-
way tie for nation's top scorer, net-
ting three goals and six assists in
four games for Nebraska-Omaha,
while teammate Joey Martin leads
the country with seven assists.
"It all depends on you coming
out of your zone quick and clean
and keeping the puck in their zone,"
Berenson said. "If you look at their
goals, they're leading the country
in offense, but most of it is 5-on-5
goals. It's not like their power play is
lighting it up more than anyone else,
but it's the 5-on-5 game."
To combat the prolific Maverick
offense, Berenson will send senior
netminder Shawn Hunwick out
to start between the pipes on Fri-
day and senior Bryan Hogan on
Saturday. Hunwick is coming off a
career-high 45 saves against New
Hampshire, including eight in over-
time.
Hunwick was a vital compo-
nent of Michigan's penalty kill unit
against the Wildcats, and his play

Saturday kept the Wolverines in the
game, as Michigan found itself in
penalty trouble late in the game -
taking a total of six penalties for 12
minutes. The Wolverines held the
New Hampshire power play unit to
one conversion in five attempts.
But the defensive play will be
especially critical this series to give
the goaltenders a shot at keeping
the Wolverines in the game and the
offense an opportunity to sustain
pressure in the Maverick zone.
"We have pretty good forwards,"
senior center Louie Caporusso said.
"It's always great for our defense-
men to practice against our own
forwards. The passing is the biggest
thing, not messing up on the pass-
ing. The things that we should be
doing correctly every single time
are what we have to concentrate on
(this weekend)."
After being swept on the road
by Nebraska-Omaha last February,
Caporusso and some of the Wolver-
ines carry some extra incentive into
this weekend's matchup. But Beren-
son prefers to look at the future -
knowing that beating top-ranked
teams is the only way for his Wol-
verines to show what they're made
of, starting with the home series
this weekend.
"You're as good as your last
game," Berenson said. "We tied a
team that outshot us, and they beat
a team in their own building, con-
vincingly.
"This team is the real deal."

Senior running back John Clay leads a potent Wisconsin running attack, along with freshman James White.

and discard the upholstered furni-
ture," Chamberlain said.
"We don't want to have to
enforce this (ban)," she said. "We
want it to take care of itself."
Chamberlain added that AAFD
hasn't issued a single warning or
fine since the ban officially took
effect in order to give residents
time to get rid of the upholstered
porch furniture.
However, Chamberlain said the
department would likely start issu-
ing warnings soon after this week-

end's collection.
Under the terms of the ordi-
nance, residents found in violation
will first be issued a "pre-citation"
after which they will have a "rea-
sonable" period of time to remove
the furniture, Chamberlain said in
a Sept. 21 article in The Michigan
Daily.
If violators choose not to remove
the furniture during that time
period, they will face a fine of up
to $1,000, Chamberlain said in the
article, though she hopes it never
reaches that point.
"Never has enforcement been
the priority," Chamberlain said in
yesterday's interview. "It's always

been about education and compli-
ance."
In a separate interview yester-
day, Sumedh Bahl, the city's com-
munity services area administrator
and an active official in enforcing
the ban, echoed Chamberlain's
comments about education over
penalization.
"Our goal is not to penalize,"
Bahl said. "Our goal is to address
safety, and that ... is the course
we're taking."
Residents who leave furniture
before or after the official col-
lection times will be subject to
fines, according to a city press
release.


NCRC
From Page 1
approximately 2-million-square-
foot facility in June 2009 and has
since been preparing the space for
use.
According to NCRC Executive
Director David Canter, about 400
people have already moved into
the complex, and 100 of those
moved in within the last two
months. By March, University
officials hope to have 500 people
settled in the site.
BoroPharm - a private chemi-
cal company - is already working
inside the facility, and research
groups that specialize in transla-
tional oncology, cardiovascular
health, health technologies, sus-
tainable energy and biomaterials
are set to follow.
Due to the rapid increase in
research opportunities, both Can-
ter and Jim Kosteva, the Uni-
versity's director of community
relations, are optimistic about the
NCRC's potential to createnew jobs
and increase revenue for Ann Arbor
businesses.

"We've outlined a goal of 3,000
new jobs at that facility over the
next decade, and that would about
replicate the number of employees
that Pfizer had at the site," Koste-
va said. "It unquestionably would
have a positive impact on local
businesses in the Plymouth Road
corridor."
Many retailers in the surround-
ing area hope to experience an
increase in foot traffic and revenue
from the complex.
Chris Klademenos, owner of
Flim Flam Restaurant - a Chinese
restaurant located in the Plymouth
Road Mall across from the NCRC -
said the combination of losing Pfiz-
er customers and the recent road
construction on Plymouth Road
has brought down business signifi-
cantly in thelast few years.
"I hope they get more people,
moreresearch, more offices (here),"
Klademenos said. "Hopefully
something will happen. Everybody
is waiting."
Despite the potential economic
growth to the area, mostbusinesses
have not seen a spike in revenue.
For Domino's Pizza, also located in
the Plymouth Road Mall, business

fell when Pfizer moved, but it has
stabilized since.
Eric Marlow, an area supervisor
for Domino's, said the restaurant is
looking forward to the possibility of
regaining the strong customer base
it had when Pfizer was in the space
with the NCRC.
In addition to business owners,
the complex may also mean eco-
nomic opportunities for residents
in the area. Canter said economic
activity generated by the site could
drive up home values in the area, as
researchers moving to Ann Arbor
look for places to live. Similarly,
job creation from the NCRC could
decrease the city's unemployment
rate, which was 9.5 percent in
August.
"The natural consequences of
adding nearly 2 million square-feet
of lab and office space will lead to
increased economic activity," Can-
ter said. "So when the University is
thriving (and) growing, the entire
community feels the benefit of
that."
According to Canter, the NCRC
will not only house research but
will also be a place for students to
take classes, intern and study.

No one was injured.
According to Bush, both sus-

Waldecker agreed, adding that
his business also offers students
something different than other

While both Estalada and
Waldecker said their businesses
are profitable, business is some-
times slow.
"It really seems to be hit or miss.
Business has been getting bet-

Waldecker said of his first month

Both owners added that they

One of the suspects was armed

camera.
"They last were seen in the area

University Police's website stated.
"... Be cautious if you need to be in

LSA sophomore Quintin Meek
said though he's never bought any-
thing from a food cart he appreci-
ates that the owners are generally
friendly and that they "don't force

LSA sophomore Julia Gu said
she feels the food carts are a vital
aspect of the city.
"I feel like the carts often go
unnoticed, but they contribute to
the dynamic of Ann Arbor," Gu
gaid.
"Officers are actively looking
for suspects and the police depart-
ment is investigating," Bush said.
Six Ann Arbor Public Schools
were on lockdown yesterday and a
"Code Red emergency notification
(had) been issued to alert citizens
near the area," the DPS website
stated.
"That was probably just stan-
dard procedure for safety's sake,"
Flocken said of the schools' lock-
downs. "All the lockdown stuff is
long gone."
The schools will proceed as
usual tomorrow, according to
Flocken.

Anew season with
Basement Arts

Max Weinberg led the band for both of Conan O'Brien's late night shows.
M ax Weinberg to set
the beat att Ark

By DAVID RIVA
Daily Arts Writer
When Max Weinberg was six
years old, he made a promise to
himself.
"My self-
imposed man- TWAaX
date as a young Weinberg
drummer was: ft Band
Play as much as
possible, prefer- Saturday
ably every day." at8 p.m.
Fifty-three The Ark
years later, $30
Weinberg con-
tinues to uphold
his promise. He is considered one
of rock'n'roll's greatest drummers
as the anchor of Bruce Springs-
teen's legendary E Street Band and
has brought his music into mil-
lions of homes during his 17 years
with the house band for Conan
O'Brien's two late-night TV shows.
"A day with drumming, for me,
is adaywell spent," he explained in
an interview with the Daily.
Weinberg's penchant for per-
formance and desire to constantly
play his instrument motivated him
to start a new project as the leader
of a big band. Billed as The Max
Weinberg Big Band, the 15-piece
orchestra is touring the country
and will make a stop in Ann Arbor
tomorrow night.
"We're (performing) what I
consider my favorite songs from
the top shelf of my record collec-
tion," he explained. "It's kind of a
musical odyssey of my life, of what
influenced me, whether it was the
big band sound or rock'n'roll or TV
themes."
The setlist contains no origi-
nal material, but past concerts
have included instrumental ren-
ditions of tunes by Frank Sinatra,
Buddy Rich and even an occasional
Springsteen song.
No plans have been made to
record the Big Band, but it's not out
of the question.
"My priority and my goal is to
play live as much as I can," he said.
The nature of these perfor-
mances, however, are drastically
different from Weinberg's normal
routine with the E Street Band.
His role as bandleader, the style
of music and the smaller venues
all contribute to an entirely new
experience.
"When you're leading your
own band, you try to (keep the
band) motivated.-,. You try to give
everybody their spotlight," he
said. "When I play with Bruce, I
have to be completely in service of
what he's doing and go in whatever
direction he's going to go into."
Certainly the contrasting styles
of rock versus swing music dictate
another notable deviation from his
past job description to his current
"Drumming for a rock band,
you're going for more impact," he
explained. "The music I'm play-
ing (now), which is largely based

in swing, technically speaking, is a connec
dotted eighth, sixteenth note, trip- teen an
let feel." "It's

"You know it when it's happen- And

this balance which is the drum-
mer's essential duty.
Perhaps the concert tour's most
glaringchange from E Streetshows
is the jump from stadiums packed
full screaming fans to small clubs do
with the audience taking a more
casual approach to listening. i
For Weinberg, this discrepancy en
is hardly worth noting.
"The size of the venue is incon-
sequential," he said. "To me, it's
about the people and getting them keep h

Abundance of
productions allows
for the quirky hits
By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
"We're like the push-up bra
of student theater," joked Kacie
Smith, director of marketing for
Basement Arts and senior in the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance.
From troublesome relation-
ships 'with imaginary friends
in "Mr. Marmalade" to Santa's
reindeer outlining his sexual
escapades in "Eight Reindeer
Monologues," Basement Arts has
a number of entertaining scripts
that will come alive on the stage
of Studio One in the Walgreen
Drama Center this season.
Basement Arts is a student-run
organization on campus that pro-
duces free theater, and is most
notable for hosting original pro-
ductions like "A Very Potter Musi-
cal" and "A Very Potter Sequel,"
which have gained national rec-
ognition and a performance at
Universal Studio's Harry Potter
theme park, as well as "Me and
my Dick," with a soundtrack that
made the Billboard charts. The
organization provides an outlet
for students to pursue their inter-
est in theater outside of main-
stream University shows.
"We're able to do things that
other student groups on campus
and the department of theater
can't do," said Corey Lubowich,
co-artistic director for Basement
Arts and a Senior in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance. "It's real-
ly a place where students from all
over campus can come and sort of
dive in and get dirty, if you will."
The name "Basement Arts"
comes from its birthplace in the
basement of the Frieze Building,
which was the home of the theater
department before it got knocked
down (North Quad has since risen
in its place.) With the move to'
Studio One on North Campus, the
distance from Central Campus
has concerned some students.
"Walgreen Drama Center
... isn't as far as people think,"
Smith said. "People are so afraid
of North Campus if they've never

been there; it's just like a 10-min-
ute bus ride."
Funding from the theater
department affords Basement
Arts the chance to not charge
their audience for admittance.
"When people hear'free' they're
like 'Oh cool, it's free,' "Smith said,
though she also acknowledged that
freetheater can have a certainlow-
quality stigma.
"In our opinion, our shows
match or even surpass the qual-
ity of University productions," she
added. "You're not goingto get the
same technical elements because
our budget is a lot smaller, but
there are some really quality per-
formances and fun shows."
Shows usually involves five
directors, six designers and three-
to 13-person casts. They can come
from any major or school at the
University.
"Everyone can be involved,
everyone can produce shows and
anyone can propose to direct a
show," Smith said. "One thing
we've been working at is to kind
of expand our base and let people
know that they can audition."
The season lineup is created
through a proposal system, in
which scripts are submitted and
reviewed by the 26-person Base-
ment Arts board. I
"It's up to the directors to
choose what shows they want to
propose, which is why we have
such an eclectic season," Smith
explained. "We look for things
that push limits and push the
boundaries of what we've done

before, and things that have never
been done by the University pro-
ductions."
"Ultimately the school still
needs people to buy tickets so that
kind of influences what they pick,"
Lubowich added, explaining the
difference between these shows
and those of Basement Arts.
While most student production
groups only produce about two
shows a year, Basement Arts puts
on 10 to 14.
"Since we do so many pro-
ductions, there's room to do
something quirkier," Lubowich
explained. "It's not like our eggs
are all in one basket, we spread it
out over the season; there's some-
thing for everyone. It might be
a really dark contemporary pl4y
that makes you sick to your stonrn-
ach one week, and one week it's
'Me and my Dick."'
A smaller stage and intimate
atmosphere connect the audience
to the productions.
"It's a really different experi-
ence when you're in this tiny the-
ater with 100 different people as
opposed to the Power Center with
1,500 people," Lubowich said.
"There's electricity and magic
that happens there, and that's
really excitingto me as a designer,
director and as a supporter of the
theater and the arts."
The kickoff for the season will
be "Mr. Marmalade," directed by
Olivia Lloyd, a sophomore in the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance,
and will envelop theatergoers
with its dark and chilling themes.

'Radiant Sun' shows a .
true artist's struggle

"Say hello to my fuckint humongous frieod!"
Paint the CIA 'RED'

Don't discount the
seniors who kick ass
in comic-book flick
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Film Editor
In a year filled with "let's put
a highly skilled team together to
combat a massive conspiracy"
movies (see "The
Losers," "The ***-
A-Team" and
"The Expend- RED
ables") the Quality16
similarly plot- atyav
ted "RED" feels andRave
like shoveling Summit
manure onto the
pile. The film's only major tweak
from the formula, and the only
thing saving it from irrelevance,
is its silver-haired, 10-percent-
discount-at-Wendy's-eligible
cast. Granted, some of the cast
members of "The Expendables"
were also on the senile end of the
cognitive-abilities spectrum, but
"RED" expertly uses the old age
of its characters for (intentional-
ly) comedic purposes, making it a
worthwhile action-comedy romp.
The film follows Frank Moses
(Bruce Willis, "Die Hard"),
a retired CIA agent slogging
through life, his only excitement
coming from telephone conver-
sations with pension worker
Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker, TV's
"Weeds") and a hope to one day
meet her. After being inexplica-
bly targeted for assassination by

a CIA hit squad, Moses goes on
a "Blues Brothers"-like journey
to bring his former cohorts back
together and unravel the con-
spiracy behind the attack, taking
Sarah along for the ride.
4RED" thrives on the backs of
its exceptional characters. Moses
isn't just another prototypical
Bruce Willis tough-guy role; he's
an emotionally stunted killing
machine hankering for some sort
of human connection in his life.
He attempts to make one with
Sarah, who could have oh-so-
easily been written as a helpless,
shrieking, damsel-in-distress but
instead embraces the incredulity
of her situation and eagerly con-
tributes to the operation.
As Marvin Boggs, the team's
token hyper-paranoid, mentally
imbalanced wild card, John Mal-
kovich ("Burn After Reading") does
what he does best: yell loudly and
act like a crazy homeless person.
Playing the role with utterly gleeful
abandon, Malkovich is so superbly
side-splitting that one forgets this
is just a hyperactive version of the
same role he always plays.
The butter on the popcorn is
the very presence of venerated
acting legends Morgan Freeman
("Invictus") and Helen Mirren
("The Queen") in such a silly film.
Watching a guy use a machine
gun turret is not funny. Watching
an old lady use one is only kind
of funny. But seeing Dame Helen
Mirren, the Oscar winning prim-
and-proper portrayer of Queen
Elizabeth II, man a machine gun
turret with ruthless precision?

Priceless.
"RED" succeeds because, as
great as the aforementioned
scenes are, it's much more than
a one-note film about 60-some-
things running around, playing
James Bond.,The interplay among
the cast is delightful, feeling
as organic as possible amid the
absurd goings-on. The movie is at
its absolute best when the entire
team is together, but the pace of
the film is so achingly slow that by
the time this happens the movie is
already almost over.
Based on a graphic novel, the
film is shot in an ultra-cool styl-
ized manner that mimics comic
book panels (think "Scott Pil-
grim" lite). But the action isn't
completely cartoonish - sure,
there's the scene where Marvin
shoots an RPG dead-on with a
revolver, but there are also per-
fectly normal shootouts and a
brutal, "Bourne"-style man-on-
man brawl. The only gripe is that
the action sequences are annoy-
ingly brief and the climax simi-
larly lacks oomph, possibly due to
the age of the actors.
"RED" is the definition of an
escapist movie. It accomplishes
its sole purpose to be a satisfying
mental diversion for audiences,
and one can't help to think that
such luminaries as Helen Mirren
and Morgan Freeman agreed to
star in the film in the first place
to escape their typical, stodgy
dramatic roles. Undoubtedly,
you'll have as much fun watching
"RED" as the actors clearly had
making it.

By ADDIE SHRODES
DailyArts Writer
on her first day of school in
pre-World War II Germany, Ruth
Adler Schnee strolled into class
in a bright yellow sweater her
mother had knit.
"The radiant The Rad
sun is coming,"
Schnee's teacher Sun
exclaimed. "Ah, Sundayat
the radiant sun." 2p.m.
Those brightH
colors of yel- Belmal Slero
low and orange
became a favorite of Schnee, a
prominent modernist textile
designer now in her late 80s.
Her journey from Holocaust sur-
vivor to Detroit immigrant to
important designer in the 1950s
modernist movement is now the
subject of "The Radiant Sun," a
narrative documentary by Terri
Sarris. The film is co-produced
by University of Maryland Asso-
ciate Professor of Architecture
Ronit Eisenbach.
Sarris, a full-time senior lec-
turer in the University's Screen
Arts & Cultures department,
developed an absorbing interest
in artists over the years.
This is her second film docu-
menting the work of an artist or
designer, tracing the moments
that encouraged him or her to
pursue the arts. One of Sarris's
previous films, "Buzzards Steal
Your Picnic," which captures
the process of Detroit composer
Frank Pahl, won best Michigan
film in the Ann Arbor Film Festi-
val in 2008 and the Detroit Inter-
national Documentary Festival in
2007.
"I'm really kind of fascinated
by why people becond' artists

and why they persevere against
the challenges artists encoun-
ter," said Sarris, who met Detroit-
based Schnee through a mutual
friend a few years ago.
Sarris is also interested in the
design from the mid-century
modernist period, exemplified
now on TV's "Mad Men." She
wasn't familiar with Schnee's
designs before she began the doc-
umentary, but now can pick them
out of a lineup.
"I find myself watching 'Mad
Men' now and trying to see if they
use any of her designs, because
they are so identifiable," Sarris
said.
"The Radiant Sun" tells Sch-
nee's story by mixing archival
images and footage with stories
Schnee narrates of her own life.
The result is a chronological nar-
rative structure that lets Schnee
and her work speak for them-
selves.
"I didn't feel the need to
interview other people to serve
as expert testimony about how
important she is, because I think
you can see her importance from
her design and what she lived
through," Sarris said, adding that
she wanted the film to be an inti-
mate story-telling session like the
ones she found so engrossing as
she befriended Schnee.
Schnee became an especially
interesting subject to feature
because she broke through - and
was limited by - the expecta-
tions placed on women during
the 1950s.
"I've always looked to women
artists for inspiration, because as
a woman artist, I feel I have a lot
to learn from women who have
been artists before me," Sarris
said.

And Sarris found Schnee's
challenges particularly compel-
ling. If the struggle of raising
three children while sustaining
a creative practice and business
isn't enough, Schnee ultimately
had to switch from her original
interest in architecture to tex-
tile design because of the lack of
job equality between men and
women.
After graduating from the
Rhode Island School of Design
and the Cranbrook Academy of
Art, Schnee interned in New York
City with famous designer and
architect Raymond Loewy, who
designed the Coca-Cola bottle.
But she realized that, as a Jewish
woman, she would probably not
be able to find a permanent job.
She shifted interests to a realm
where women were more accept-
ed.
"This is not an uncommon
story for women, to realize that
they'll be involved in design,
but maybe not actually design-
ing the buildings themselves,"
Sarris said, adding that it is still
sometimes an "uphill climb" for
women to be taken seriously in
fields like architecture.
Sarris's interest in women art-
ists is reflected in the film's form
as well as content.
"Think of this as a new form,
of a woman making a film about
another woman's work ... a con-
versation between women," Sar-
ris said.
Continuing that conversa-
tion off screen, Schnee and the
documentary's producers will
discuss "The Radiant Sun" after
the showing. University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art will display a
selection of Schnee's textiles in
cases near the auditorium.

United States
on PBS. The duo
has taken Sir Conan Doyle's clas-
sic characters and transposed them
into the 21st century with remark-
able cleverness and fidelity to the
source material.
But to expect anything less from
the pair would been a very poor
use of deduction. They've shown
in their work on "Doctor Who"
- for which Gatiss is a writer and
Moffat the executive producer -
that eccentric banter is what they
were born to write. And there's no
character in all of fiction with a wit
quite like Sherlock's. The detective
proves a perfect match for Moffat.
and Gatiss's writing style.
The first installment of the
three-part series is by far the stron-
gest, perhaps because it had some-
thing to prove. Putting Sherlock
Holmes in the Digital Age is a bold
move that raised much skepticism
in anticipation of the series pre-
miere. So in that first episode, titled
"A Study in Pink," the task was to
find a successful way to update all
of Holmes's and Watson's quirks
and histories - which was accom-
plished - as well as to forge the
relationship between the two. This
shifted the focus greatly in favor of
the characters, away from the story,
and that was a wise shift indeed.
The tall, dark and brooding
Benedict Cumberbatch ("Cre-
ation") takes on the role of Sherlock
Holmes with all the subtlety, grace
and inept social skills the charac-
ter requires. His Holmes appears

Executive Producers Cheryl Hines
("Curb Your Enthusiasm") and
Denise Cramsey (producer of
"Extreme Makeover: Home Edi-

their new proactive series "School
Pride."
The show follows the diverse
personalities of SWAT command-
er Tom Stroup, Susie Castillo
("House of Payne"), Kym Whitley
("Til Death") and Jacob Soboroff
("AMC News") as they bring
together communities to renovate
and make over some of the coun-
try's most needy schools. The first
episode, titled "Soaring Eagles"
after the school's mascot, tells the
story of Enterprise Middle School
in Compton, California - a school
likened to a prison by the students.
