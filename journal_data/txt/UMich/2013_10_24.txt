SCOTUS case is
waiting on ruling in
Schuette suit

on the steps of the U.S.
Supreme Court earlier this
month, anti-affirmative action
activist Jennifer Gratz, who was
the plaintiff in the 2003 U.S.
Supreme Court case Gratz v. Bol-
linger, did not placate the buzz
around her potential candidacy
for the University's Board of
Regents.
At an on-campus talk Tuesday,
Gratz said she has.not ruled out
a run.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Gratz said after
her remarks her decision will
likely hinge on the Court's deci-
sion in Schuette v. Coalition to
Defend Affirmative Action, the
case for which Gratz traveled to
the court earlier this month.
Schuette v. Coalition chal-
lenges the state of Michigan's

2006 ballot initiative, which
banned the consideration of race
and gender in college admissions.
Though Gratz is neither plaintiff
nor defendant in the case that's
currently before the court, she
is no stranger to the affirmative
action debate.
In Gratz v. Bollinger, the
high court ruled on the Univer-
sity's use of affirmative action
in undergraduate admissions. In
the following years, Gratz played
a key role in passing Proposal
2, Michigan's 2006 affirmative
action ban.
With the state's policy ban-
ning affirmative action again in
the national spotlight, Gratz has
reemerged as one of its main pro-
ponents.
If the court determines that
a state can't make laws against
race- or sex-based admissions
and that a university's govern-
ing body has the autonomous
authority to determine affirma-
tive action policy, Gratz said the
only way to influence the issue
would be from a seat on the
Board of Regents.
Conversely, if the court
upholds the state constitutional

The University's student
governments are looking to
regroup and move forward
this year as each school heads
its own projects and increases
cooperative efforts.
LSA-SG WANTS TO
MAKE DEGREE MORE
. ATTRACTIVE
Initiatives for some of the
larger organizations, such as
LSA Student Government and
Rackham Student Government,
want to increase the student
enjoyment at the University
and improve prospects for the
future.
Sagar Lathia, president of
LSA Student Government, said
he's hoping to use this year as

an opportunity to rebrand the
University's largest school.
Lathia said many LSA stu-
dents have been wary of their
future job prospects compared
to students from the more tech-
nical or specific programs. He
wants to better inform under-
classmen of the resources and
opportunities within LSA, to
help them see the long-term
benefits of an LSA degree.
"Hitting it on both fronts, I
think, will comfort people in
the sense that they're already
in the major that they love but
knowing that they can do what
they want and they have the
support of LSA to get to their
career goals is something that I
think LSA students will really,
really appreciate," Lathia said.
He added that LSA-SG plans
to have alumni involved in the
rebranding campaign as well,
to give students real-life exam-
pies of their future options.

Squatter
complicates
move-in for
students
Unapproved tenant
kept six students

By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Moving into a house on cam-
pus can be a stressful process.
But it's even worse when you dis-
cover someone is already living
there and refuses to leave.
The tenants of an Elm Street
house operated by Investor's
Property Management delayed
moving in due to a "squatter"
that refused to vacate the unit.
The man living in the house had
sublet the residence through the
prior tenants without the approv-
al of IPM.
Details of the debacle weren't
available earlier this semester
due to ongoing litigation. But
now, the inconvenienced stu-
dents and IPM officials are talk-
ing about the mishap.

Trial to determine status
of Detroit's bankruptcy

Case serves as the
largest public filing
in U.S. history
DETROIT (AP) - An attor-
ney representing Detroit urged
a judge Wednesday to allow the
city to fix staggering financial
problems through bankruptcy,
arguing that without it about 65
cents of every tax dollar eventu-
ally would be gobbled up by debts
and other obligations.
The extraordinary trial,
expected to last days, brings the
bankruptcy case to its most cru-
cial stage since Detroit in July
made the largest public filing
in U.S. history.. If a judge finds
certain legal requirements were
met, the city would get the green
light to restructure $18 billion in
debt and possibly slash pensions
for thousands of people, the most
controversial target so far.
Hundreds of protesters walked

in a circle outside the courthouse
with signs that said, "Bail out
people not banks."
In his opening statement,
attorney Bruce Bennett said he
"could stand here for hours"
to describe the "mountain of
evidence" that shows Detroit
is insolvent. Without relief, he
added, 65 cents of every dollar
in residents pay in taxes could be
needed to address the problem,
leaving little for everyday servic-
es for 700,000 residents.
"This is one of those cases
where the data speaks very clear-
ly and persuasively on its own.
It needs no gloss," Bennett told
Judge Steven Rhodes.
He was followed by a line of
attorneys, representing unions,
pension funds and retiree groups,
who didn't seem to challenge the
ruinous condition of Detroit's
finances but zeroed in on a key
test under bankruptcy law: Did
the city negotiate with creditors
in good faith before the Chapter 9

000' 00

filingt No way, they said.
The judge stood to get a better
view as Jennifer Green, an attor-
ney for pension funds, used a
screen to show months of emails
and memos from state and city
officials talking about bankrupt-
cy preparation, not fruitful talks
with creditors.
Sharon Levine ofthe American
Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees said talks
between Detroit and its unions
should have lasted months not
weeks. Another lawyer, Babette
Ceccotti with the United Auto
Workers, said the bankruptcy
filing was aimed at using federal
law to attack pensions, which
otherwise are protected under
the Michigan Constitution.
"Chapter 9 was already a for-
gone conclusion" before the city
last met with creditors a week
before the filing, Green said.
Bennett, however, said emer-
gency manager Kevyn Orr'steam
was cooperative and open to sug-
gestions.
"The city created a data base,
populated it with enormous
amounts of information and did
not withhold information to
get an edge," he said. "The city
did act in good faith in all of the
negotiations. The negotiations
were unsuccessful."
The first and only witness
Wednesday was Gaurav Mal-
hotra, an analyst from Ernst &
Young. He said he warned Orr
last summer that Detroit likely
was facing a 10-year budget defi-
cit of $3.9 billion, mainly due to
pensions and health care costs.
Detroit is being run by Orr, a
bankruptcy specialist who was
appointed in March by Gov. Rick
Snyder. They will be trial wit-
nesses, along with Police Chief
James Craig and outside financial
consultants.
Michigan's emergency manag-
er law gives Orr wide discretion
to operate the city, from hiring
people to deciding how services
are delivered. Many local elect-
ed officials, including Mayor
Dave Bing, are on the sideline
and have no role in the trial.

Netanyahu, Kerry
meet for seven
hours to discuss
disarmament
ROME (AP) - Israel's prime
minister urged the U.S. on
Wednesday to be as tough in
nuclear negotiations with Iran
as it is about dismantling Syria's
chemical weapons stockpile.
The comments put new pres-
sure on Washington to convince
two of its key Mideast allies that
America will not sell out their
interests as it tentatively warms
diplomacy with Tehran.
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, at the start of a sev-
en-hour meeting with U.S. Sec-
retary of State John Kerry, said
the world should not acceptwhat
he called a "partial deal" with
Iran. He said that would include
any agreement that falls short of
requiring Iran to end all enrich-
ment on uranium, get rid of all
fissile material, and close water
plants and underground bunkers
that he said are only necessary to

build a nuclear bomb.
Negotiations between Iran
and world powers, which
resumed several weeks ago
after a six-month lull, have come
nowhere near demanding the
level of tough restrictions on
Tehran that Israel wants. The
nuclear talks also have spooked
Saudi Arabia, spurring Kerry to
meetwith top officials from both
Mideast nations about an issue
that has unified the two long-
time adversaries.
Iran maintains that its nucle-
ar program is peaceful, and its
capabilities necessary for energy
and medical uses.
"A partial deal that leaves
Iran with these capabilities is a
bad deal," Netanyahu told Kerry
at the start of their meeting
in Rome. "You wisely insisted
there wouldn't be a partial deal
with Syria. You're right. If (Syr-
ian President Bashar) Assad had
said, 'Well, I'd like to keep, I don't
know, 20 percent, 50 percent, or
80 percent of my chemical weap-
ons capability,' you would have
refused, and correctly so."
Netanyahu also said the U.S.
should retain its harsh economic

sanctions against Iran until it
dismantles its nuclear program.
"That's what got them into these
renewed negotiations in the first
place," he said. Obama admin-
istration officials are weighing
whether to ease some sanctions
- even as some U.S. lawmakers
in Congress are eyeing plans to
tighten the economic hurdles -
if Iran takes steps to scale back
its program.
Kerry, who spent the last
three days in meetings with
European and Mideast officials
that focused mostly on Iran and
Syria, said the U.S. would con-
tinue to do everything it can to
prevent Tehran from building
nuclear weapons. But he stopped
short of agreeing with Netanya-
hu's demands.
"We will need to know that
actions are being taken which
make it crystal clear, undeniably
clear, failsafe to the world, that
whatever (Iranian) program is
pursued is indeed a peaceful
program," Kerry said. "No deal
is better than a bad deal. But if
this can be solved satisfactorily,
diplomatically, it is clearly better
for everyone.

US Secretary of State John Kerry, right, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shake hands for the media on the
occasion of their meeting at Villa Taverna, the US Ambassador's residence in Rome on Wednesday.

a reason to run for the Board of
Regents.
"I think the Constitution
should really determine what the
University can do," she said.
In an Oct. 10 Detroit News

regent, she would have the abil-
ity to impact policy at a University
she still admires.
"I want to take the battle full
circle," Gratz said. "I'd be there to

Gratz graduated from UM-
Dearborn and cited the Univer-

brother's life during a battle with

Additionally, Gratz said on
Tuesday she would also consid-
er other contenders in the race

GRADUATE STUDENT
LEADERS WORK ON
HOUSING, RELATIONS
S The Rackham Student Gov-
ernment has already been very
active this year, specifically on
housing for graduate students,
under the direction of RSG Presi-
dent Phil Saccone. RSG worked
with University administration
on the Munger Residence Hall at
a forum last month, but Saccone
said the RSG has even more on
the horizon.
As early as next week, RSG
will work with the Washtenaw
Area Apartment Association on
gathering student input on their
apartment-leasing ordinance,
Saccone said. He added that RSG
is trying to determine student
opinion on possible changes to
the current law, which takes
apartments off the market for 70
days following a lease signing.
"I suspect that they would
be at least in favor of keeping
the current ordinance and not
extending the amount of time
because it puts a lot of pressure
on students to make a decision in

set to move into the house for a
lease starting this fall that some-
one was still living in the house,
and that their move-in date,
scheduled for Aug. 29, would be
delayed.
But Engineering senior Jac-
lyn Reimann, one of the incom-
ing tenants, is doubtful that IPM
became aware of the situation
that close to the move-in date.
"They had to have known,"
Reimann said. "That's when you
go and clean the houses and get
everybody out."

The following day, IPM and the
squatter attended a court hearing,
during which a judge informed
representatives of the company
that although the man was not
paying rent, the city could not
legally force him to leave, because
he had received occupancy from
the company's previous, lawful
tenants, IPM property manager
John Wade said.
"In the court's eyes, they still
saw him as a legal occupant,"
Wade said.
According to Michigan law,
tenants must be provided with a
30-day eviction notice if they stay

To run in the November 2014
general election, Gratz must
become one of the two Repub-
lican candidates nominated by
the state convention to face off
against the two chosen Demo-
cratic candidates.
The state party's nominating
conventions do not occur until
later in 2014.
In 2012, three Republican can-
didates tussled for a spot on the
Republican ticket. So far, alum
Ron Weiser, an Ann Arbor busi-
nessman, former chair of the
Michigan Republican Party and
the current RNC Finance Chair-
man, has been the only Republi-
can candidate to throw his hat in
the ring.
Weiser sought the position in
2012, but he was not nominated
to run on the general-election
ballot. In November, Democratic
candidates Mark Bernstein and
Shauna Ryder Diggs defeated the
Republican candidates, cardiolo-
gist Rob Steele and Dan Horning,
a former regent.
If Gratz achieves her party's
nomination, she will likely face

two incumbent Democratic
regents, whose eight-year terms
will expire in January 2015.
Regents Katherine White and
Julia Darlow, both Ann Arbor
attorneys, will have to run for re-
election to retain their seats on
the board.
In a statement to The Michi-
gan Daily on Tuesday, White said
she plans to seek a third term as
regent. She was first elected in
1998.
Darlow said in a statement she
has not yet decided if she will seek
a second term.
If Gratz were to win a seat, she
could face a Democratic major-
ity board. The board's makeup is
currently six Democrats and two
Republicans.
The two Republicans currently
on the board are Regents Andrew
Richner and Andrea Fischer
Newman. Gratz said Tuesday she
was not worried about finding
allies on the board in either party.
"Whether I found allies or
not, I would stand up for what
I believe in, and I think I have a
proven record of that," Gratz said.

a whole.
This distinction was crucial
in determining the fate of the
three former University profes-
sors that the lecture honored:
H. Chandler Davis, Mark Nick-
erson and Clement Markert,
who were suspected of com-
munist affiliations, testified
before the House Un-American
Activities Committee regard-
ing.
When these professors
refused to testify, all three were
suspended from teaching at the
University, ultimately leading to
Davis and Nickerson's perma-
nent dismissal.
The University's choice to
fire the professors was contro-
versial, because the termination
was due to "extramural speech"
- speech, or affiliations with
political groups outside of the
University.
Heins noted the practice of
these dismissals and similar
cases were addressed in the

1968 court case Pickering, in
which the U.S. Supreme Court's
opinion asserted that under
the First Amendment, teachers
could not be punished for their
remarks on public issues unless
their expression could be prov-
en to interfere with "workplace
efficiency."
While some believe that the
ruling in Pickering v. Board of
Education resolved the issue of
teachers lacking first amend-
ment rights, universities are now
left to decide whether or not the
extramural speech of their pro-
fessors interferes with their abil-
ity to do their job.
Heins said sometimes profes-
sor's opinions might differ from
those supporting universities,
causing the institution to decide
that their public opinions do
interfere with workplace effi-
ciency.
"The trustees don't like it, and
they bear pressure on the univer-
sity to fire the professor," Heins
said.
In an interview before the
lecture, Heins said opinions on
academic freedom are complex
because, while it has a legal

meaning, it is also subject to the
standards of a university. She
said it is time for the University
to make a firm stance on where
the line is drawn between pro-
fessional workplace and personal
freedom.
"Even though the First
Amendment only applies to what
public universities do the con-
cept of academic freedom should
apply to all colleges and institu-
tions," Heins said. "It's the basic
underpinning of what we under-
stand higher education to be,
but it's not unlimited. Yes, there
should be free speech on campus
... the professor ought to have a
lot of freedom but not complete
freedom - there's got to be some
protections."
After the lecture, Rackham
student Vishal Khandelwal said
it's important that professors
and researchers take notice of
the issues Heins brought up.
"It's really relevant to how
we'll be conducting academia in
the future," Khandelwal said.
"I wish she could have stressed
more on the opposition that fac-
ulty face from, within the aca-
demic establishment."

Saccone said.
RSG also looks to build bet-
ter student-faculty relations in

online, he said.
Other governments are head-
ing similar efforts in their respec-
tive schools. The Public Health
Student Assembly, led by Presi-
dent Cameron Glenn, will seem-
ingly start from scratch this year
to try and emphasize collabora-
tion between the Public Health
departments and an increasingly
diverse student body.
ENGINEERING COUNCIL
WORKING ON SYLLABUS
DATABASE
Engineering Council President
Cristine Zuchora is working on
an online syllabus database for
the engineeringschool to meet an
overdue request from students.
Earlier this year, LSA Student
Government leaders launched
their own archive of syllabi, the
result of a two year effort.
The Engineering Council is
also working to amplify connec-
tions with student organizations
and help the groups' funding.
Across the board, student gov-
ernment presidents said they are
pleased with the resources they
have and can reach their own
goals individually. Still, many

acknowledged that more collec-
tive action could be beneficial to
the student governments and the
University overall.
While in the past collaboration
between Central Student Govern-
ment and the various individual
governments may have been lack-
ing, the presidents are looking to
increase parthership this year.
CSG President Michael Proppe
said there is room for increased
collaboration on some larger proj-
ects, calling LSA's segregated
efforts in improving digital access
to syllabi as a "missed opportunity"
for unity.
In the past, individual stu-
dent governments have primarily
focused on their own agendas and
rarely on campus-wide initiatives,
Proppe said.
"It's kind of a two-way street,"
he said. "The other student govern-
mentscome to us aswellas making
sure we're going to the other stu-
dent governments to uphold that
communication."
Proppe added that better orga-
nization of the University Council,
headed by CSG Vice President Rob-
ert Dishell, should allow for more
joint projects in the comingyears.
Proppe said collaboration has
seen results so far this year, noting
Rackham Student Government's
forum on the Munger Residence
Hall, appeals against the new
footballseating policy and
expressed concerns about the
presidential search committee.

Student charged in teacher's murder

14-year-old boy
found walking on
state highway
DANVERS, Mass. (AP) - A
well-liked teacher was found
slain in woods behind this
quiet Massachusetts town's
high school, and a 14-year-old
boy who was found walking
along a state highway over-
night was charged with killing
her.
Blood found in a second-
floor school bathroom helped
lead investigators to the body
of Colleen Ritzer, a 24-year-old
math teacher at Danvers High
School who was reported miss-
ing when she didn't come home
from work on Tuesday, Essex
District Attorney Jonathan
Blodgett said. .

"She was a very, very respect-
ed, loved teacher," Blodgett
said.
The suspect, Philip Chism,
was arraigned on a mur-
der charge Wednesday and
ordered held without bail.
The teenager, described by
classmates as soft-spoken and
pleasant, also did not come
home from school the day
before and was spotted walk-
ing along Route 1 in the neigh-
boring town of Topsfield at
about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Officials didn't release a
cause of death and haven't dis-
cussed a motive in the killing.
A court filing said Ritzer
and Chism were known to each
other from the high school, but
it did not elaborate. The arrest
was made based on statements
,by the suspect and corroborat-
ing evidence at multiple scenes,

investigators said in court doc-
uments.
Ritzer's family said they are
mourning the death of their
"amazing, beautiful daughter
and sister."
"Everyone that knew and
loved Colleen knew of her pas-
sion for teaching and how she
mentored each and every one
of her students," the family said
in a statement provided by her
uncle Dale Webster.
At his arraignment in adult
court in Salem, Chism's defense
attorney argued for the pro-
ceeding to be closed and her
client to be allowed to stay
hidden because of his age. The
judge denied the request. The
lawyer, Denise Regan, declined
to comment outside court. No
statement had been released
from his family byWednesday
evening.

past the natural end of the lease.
Since the house's occupier was
protected by the rule, it forced
Reimann and the new tenants to
wait.
IPM pushed back this year's
tenants' move-in date to as late as
Sept. 19th, and offered to put the
six tenants in hotels near Plym-
outh road and Briarwood Mall in
the meantime.
Because it wasn't clear if they'd
be compensated for the hotel stay,
the tenants decided to stay with
friends or live at home instead.
Two of the tenants did not have
cars to commute to and from cam-
pus, so the hotel option wasn't
practical.
A secondary hearing was
held Sept. 4. The squatter, who
attended with his social worker
and stepfather, found other liv-
ing arrangements and agreed to
leave the Elm Street house that
day. Within the week, IPM had
cleaned the property and given
the new tenants their keys.
Reimann said IPM is waiving
rent for her and her roommates
during the timespan in which
they weren't able to move in. She
said they're also looking to get
compensation for commuting to
and from campus. Wade didn't
detail how the tenants would be
compensated.

Gayle Rosen, housing attorney
at the University's Student Legal
Services, said in an e-mail inter-
view that subleasing problems are
frequent, but rarely involveasub-
tenantstayingtoo longor refusing
to vacate the unit.
Rosen added that she more
commonly sees instances of
building damage and nonpayment
of rent, but noted that these cases
usually occur in the spring and
summer, when more students are
subletting.
Wade, the IPM property man-
ager, warned students to think
twice before they sublet their
homes.
"I think it certainly proves
that it makes a lot of sense to go
through the proper channels,
to check with their landlord,
to make sure they're following
proper procedures," Wade said.
"This points in the direction of,
well, how much economic relief
are you getting (from subleasing)
versus what are some of the other
risks that you may be undertak-
ing?"

FROM THE DAILY
New York, New York
Regents trip to NYC further diminishes students' involvement
he University's Board of Regents is planning a private "strategic
planning session" in New York City for Jan. 16 and 17 of next year.
In place of the monthly public meeting, the regents will meet with
leaders of other prestigious higher-education institutions, as well as with
potential donors. This trip is part of the University's zealous fundrais-
ing effort for its new capital campaign, Victors for Michigan, that kicks
off in November. With fundraising as the focus, the public sessions that
are open to students and faculty will now be decreased, once again, to 10
meetings instead of the usual 11. While the trip addresses the University's
growing need for private fundraising as well as other administrative func-
tions, it further diminishes students' already limited involvement with
the regents, especially during this crucial presidential selection process.

A similar meeting was held last January
in California with leaders from University
of California, Berkeley and Stanford among
others, to gain insight from a system going
through similar financial strain. This time,
issues -- such as the possibility of a nega-
tive 2014 fiscal year attributed to the mass of
newly insured patients under the Affordable
Care Act, $800 million spent on the Epic Sys-
tem and $750 million spent on the new C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital and Von Voigtland-
er Women's Hospital - will be addressed.
The trip also coincides with a donor event
held by the University's most recent prolific
benefactor, real-estate tycoon Stephen Ross.
These looming concerns necessitate that the
regents tofocus on fundraising and discover-
ing new sources of revenue. This especially
holds true because Michigan has cut invest-
ments for public universities by 32 percent
since 2008, which in part caused significant
increases in tuition rates, thus putting a strain
on maintaining academic excellence. With this
drastic loss in state revenue, it's imperative

that the regents fundraise from private sources
- a responsibility they have effectively taken
up. However, the regents' role shouldn't be pri-
marily focused around fundraising, especially
when it comes at the expense of involving the
community in the board's functions like the
presidential search process.
The 10 public meetings are the only inter-
action students can have with the regents.
The need for student involvement should be
accentuated by the fact that the University is
in the midst of selecting a new president. Yet,
there is no student voice that actively advises
the board, let alone the Presidential Search
Committee. On top of that, the University
never specified why the trip is private instead
of public.
The lack of public funding has forced the
Board of Regents to take upon the crucial
duties of fundraising and therefore, the sub-
sequent to trips to California and, now, New
York. But while these trips and efforts are jus-
tified, they should be coupled with transpar-
ency and other avenues for student feedback.

have a running joke with the
opinion editors of The Michigan
Daily that they never use the
titles I send in
with my articles.
when i finished
my last piece, I
titled it "Fuck
the Police" as
a joke - it was
not meant to be
used in print or JAMES
online, but that's BRENNAN
the title that ran.
That being said, I
am not blaming
my editors for a title that may have
offended some. I wrote it, I sent it
in and, therefore, any offense taken
or any anger generated should be
directed at me and only me. Further-
more, this is not an apology. I don't
just stand by the Daily, my editors
and my title, but I stand by the legiti-
macy of the phrase "fuck the police."
When the rap group N.W.A.
released their infamous song in1988,
they were not trying to be contro-
versial or attract attention. "Fuck
tha Police" expresses much of the
outrage felt by the Black community
in post-civil-rights America, where
racism and discrimination has large-
ly shifted to the "colorblind" crimi-
nal justice system.
As I stated in my previous column,
my criticism and distrust for police
is not rooted in a hatred for individu-
al police officers, the overwhelming
majority of whom are decent people
of integrity. My distrust in police is
rooted in a hatred for the policies
that dictate their actions. .
As Michelle Alexander describes
in her book, "The New Jim Crow,"
federal, state and local policies
incentivize and enable police to dis-

proportionately criminalize Black
men in urban areas. Though minori-
ties and whites use drugs nearly the
same rate, more than 80 percent of
"stop-and-frisks" by police in New
York are of Blacks or Latinos. Police
perform as many stops on Black New
Yorkers as there are Black people in
New York. They assume guilt rather
than innocence, filling required quo-
tas instead of helping people in the
most crime-ridden areas. This seems
to be the norm in most of the United
States, where the prison population
has more than quintupled in the last
30 years, with nearly half of those
incarcerated being Black.
While other factors play a role in
the racial disparities of the criminal
justice system, the majority of the
blame still falls on the shoulders of
police. By focusing on quotas, tar-
geting poor, African American areas
and failing to address the inherent
anti-black biases in individual offi-
cers - including officers of color
- police overwhelmingly target
minorities for arrest, throwing them
into the merciless depths of the
criminal justice system. The high
sentences and overwhelmed attor-
neys don't help, but the fact of the
matter is once you're in court, your
chances of getting away without a
conviction are slim no matter who
you are. Once someone is arrested
and charged, the turning gears of
 the criminal justice system are hard
to stop.
After the shooting of Trayvon
Martin, dozens of individuals wrote
testimonials about "the talk" that
Black parents often feel compelled to
have with their sons. My father had
a similar sit down with me a handful
of times as a teenager, but he never
had to tell me that the color of my

skin made me a target for police. He
never once mentioned that police
wouldlookatmewithextrascrutiny,
assuming I'm a criminal because of
my hair, and he never had to empha-
size that because of the way I choose
to dress, I have to remain calm and
move slowly or I may catch a bullet.
Individual police officers are not
bad people, just like any other group
of Americans. But like everyone else,
they follow their boss's orders and
act on imperfect, human impulses.
The only differences between police
and everyone else are their badge,
their gun and their authority to use
both. No law enforcement body will
ever be perfect,but with one in every
three Black men in America going to
prison, the United States criminal
justice system has proven itself an
utter failure.
Even as a privileged, white male I
will never be able to see a police offi-
cer or squad car without being over-
come.by anxiety - I cringe trying
to imagine what goes through the
heads of my friends of other identi-
ties in the same situation.
These feelings do not highlight
something wrong with us, but rath-
er point out the massive flaws with
police in America. Police policies are
a driving force for racial and social
injustice, and this was evident long
before N.W.A. released their infa-
mous anthem.
Until law enforcement shows
that its true interest is in promoting
public safety rather than attacking
people of color, me and countless
others will continue to say it loud,
say it proud, and say it with plenty of
justification: Fuck the police.

A venture for adventure

The enigma of Guantanamo Bay

I want to travel. To Europe. To Asia.
Anywhere.
Well, maybe not Ohio.
But, it's just so expensive. I mean, we're
talking thousands of dollars per trip out of
the country.
So, let me ask: If you could travel anywhere
in the world for free, with the only catch
being maintaining a blog and collecting some
research - maybe - would you do it? I sure
would.
And that's exactly what a new website,
called Trevolta, floating around my Facebook
newsfeed is trying to accomplish.
By using crowdfunding - a fundraising
strategy where donors can pitch in how much
or little money they want - Trevolta aims to
offer people the opportunity to travel at the
expense of generous friends and sponsors
"who are looking for extraordinary, unique
and unforgettable trips which will be fol-
lowed and shared by hundreds of thousands
of people." And in return for their donations,
the travelers will complete "specific tasks to
be performed along the trip."
Trevolta's success is questionable and
remains to be seen, but I believe in its mis-
sion, and I think that's what will keep it
around for good. Although Ihave to question
why someone would pay for me to have an
incredible experience if they could afford to
go themselves. But, OK, let's say it does work
and there are those people and companies out
there willing to fund these trips. Then this is
a truly extraordinary opportunity.
It's always tossed around that "you should
travel while you're young." And I can attest
to that.
In the summer between my freshman
and sophomore year of high school, I spent
35 days traveling across the western United
States. I backpacked in Yosemite National
Park, played capture-the-flag in Goblin Valley
State Park and climbed to the top of Angels
Landing in Zion National Park. And while it
certainly didn't come cheap, I learned much
more about myself and what this country has
to offer than at any other point in my life.
I became more mature, more independent

and realized despite the amount of time I
spend in front of technology, my greatest
memories have been when I was farthest
away from it. It was life changing in the best
possible way.
More people need to have this experience.
And it doesn't just need to be through a study-
.abroad program. Travel, even without having
to go to a classroom, has the potential be as
impactful on a person as a college education.
Put simply, traveling teaches. Imagine the
feeling and lessons from completing a climb
of Mt. Everest or a scuba dive through the
Great Barrier Reef.
And I guess that's why I think Trevolta
will work. It has the feel of a scholarship -
perfect for giving the college-aged student
that breathtaking - while - educational
experience, he or she wouldn't have been able
to have without this opportunity.
And it's important to note that Trevolta and
the sponsors aren't just throwing out money
for these trips. Getting your trip funded takes
effort. Your trip page needs to be fully detailed,
including a video pleading your case - so I
would bet that vaguely titled "Vegas Trip"
probably wouldn't rack up funds.
What I like most about Trevolta is that
it promotes altruism - a culture of unself-
ish giving - in what feels like a very selfish
world. Laws are being enacted purely based
on self-interest. The government was shut
down because some people couldn't accept
defeat. And it seems like nearly every day you
find out about how someone scammed thou-
sands of people out of money.
These crowdfunding sites give me hope
that we are better than what the media often
portrays. That even though I don't under-
stand why someone would pay for my trip to
climb Half Dome, someone is paying for my
trip to climb Half Dome. That even though
school supposedly teaches us to be indepen-
dent, critical thinkers, it's OK to get help and
support from others.
Now, can someone teach me how to book
a flight?

W ith many U.S. citizens
focused on the after-
math of the govern-
ment shutdown
and debt ceiling
battles and the
Affordable Care
Act, the illegality
of Guantanamo
Bay Detention
Center has been
pushed to the A
back burner.
There are still LEVINE
164 prisoners
being detained
at Guantanamo. Oddly enough, 86
of these prisoners have been told
they're cleared for release - some as
long as five years ago - yet they're
still incarcerated. These men are
held without being informed as to
why and have been given no notice
or hope of trial. The ongoing tor-
ture at Guantanamo Bayviolates not
only the principles of the Constitu-
tion through the Sixth and Eighth
Amendments, but also basic human
rights and the Geneva Convention.
The Guantanamo issue has not gone
away; it has just been swept under
the rug. The inhumane torture is
real, current and must be stopped.
In March 2013, details of a hunger
strike began leaking out of the pris-
on walls. The reason the prisoners
went on hunger strike "is disputed,"
according to The New York Times,
but in transcripts by several pris-
oners, they explain that they were
offended when the guards stormed
their cells, tore their belongings
apart and engaged in the sacrile-
gious and disrespectful act of rifling
through their Korans. Addition-
ally, several prisoners reported they
were striking because they were
cleared for release, yet are still being
held. To combat the hunger strike,
the guards have taken it upon them-
selves to physically force the prison-
ers to eat. Twice daily they enter the

prisoners cell, strap them to a chair
- reminiscent to an electric chair
- and force an invasive catheter
down their noses to their stomachs,
scratching their innards along the
way, before pumping liquid food into
the prisoners' stomachs. The tran-
scripts report that the men expe-
rience immense pain. A graphic,
animated video created by two Brit-
ish journalists depicts force-feeding
scenes from the transcripts.
Force-feeding of this nature is
considered cruel and unusual pun-
ishment and would likely not be tol-
grated within the continental U.S.
prison system. But these aren't the
only forms of torturethat the prison-
ers experience. Reports outlined by
the Center for Constitutional Rights
explain beatings, solitary confine-
ment and other disgusting torture
methods. How is our government
getting away with this abusive pun-
ishment that is inflicted on people
who may or may not even be respon-
sible for any terrorism? The answer is
that they shouldn't be.
The Sixth Amendment of the
United States Constitution prohib-
its holding prisoners without telling
them the nature of their accusation,
and it also provides for a "speedy and
public trial," which obviously these
prisoners have been denied. The
Eight Amendment provides for no
use of cruel or unusual punishment.
Guantanamo, however, originally got
beyond these parameters through
loopholes. In 2002, the Bush admin-
istration proclaimed that Guanta-
namo Bay, based on its geographical
location, could be considered outside
of U.S. legal jurisdiction, and thus
outside of the U.S. protections for
prisoners. The "enemy combatants"
of the global War on Terror were to
be kept and tortured there - and no
one could save them. According to
the Center for Constitutional Rights,
U.S. military intelligence officers
have been reported as saying, "You

are inaplace where there is no law -
we are the law."
But what aboutinternational laws
designed to protect prisoners from
this type of punishment through the
Geneva Convention? Interestingly
enough, the Bush administration
strangely claimned that the Geneva
Convention did not apply to the U.S.
conflict with al-Qaeda. The U.S.
Supreme Court, however, disagreed.
The Boston University News Service
writes thatin four separate cases, the
Court, "held that international law
applies to Guantanamo detainees,
that they cannot be held indefinitely
without trial, that constitutional
habeas corpus protections.apply to
them ... " Furthermore, Article 3 of
the Geneva Conventions was upheld
for all individuals in conflict. Thus,
fair and humane treatment must be
given to the prisoners at Guantana-
mo - see Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. So,
while this battle seems to have been
legally won, that was seven years
ago. The government has still not
abided by these decisions and the
men continue to sit in Guantanamo,
being tortured daily.
Contrary to public opinion, this
*debate has not grown cold. In May
2013, President Barack Obama
promised to take steps towards clos-
ing Guantanamo by transferring
cleared detainees to other countries,
yet four months later he has yet to
fulfill this promise. On Oct. 7, 2013,
the ACLU and other humanitarian
organizations sent a letter to the
President, urging him to close the
prison and end the torture. Guan-
tanamo Bay has become an enigma:
a legal quagmire of embarrassing
and disgusting violations of human
rights that has been stealthily avoid-
ed since 2002. The Supreme Court's
decisions must be respected and the
torture must be stopped.

Wolverines make
hostility their own

'M' stuns Spartans on road

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - Six thou-
sand, one hundred and eighty-
three people stood, watched and
yelled. Every moment, whenever
the ball hit a Michigan State
player's hand, the crowd was
" ready to explode.
And it didn't faze Molly Toon.
"In my mind, I pretend they're
cheering for us," said the Michi-
gan senior outside hitter. "It's
just a little trick that I have. It's
fun."
Wednesday, the Michigan vol-
leyball team had to win by tak-
ing every one of Michigan State's
punches and punching back.
And that was difficult at times,
because 6,000 people were root-
ing for them not to do so.
On three set points and a
handful of others, the Michi-
gan State crowd thought every
bounce would go its way - every
attack attempt, every block
attempt, every set.
But every time, Michigan
had just enough to keep it alive.
At one point, the ball simply
bounced off freshman middle
blocker Abby Cole's hand by acci-
dent, right to senior outside hit-
ter Lexi Erwin.
"We have to win some like
that," said Michigan coach Mark
Rosen. "We're not going to win
every one pretty."
Michigan State pulled away
to win the first set, 25-20, and
looked like it could hand Michi-
gan its sixth Big Ten loss. It cer-
tainly had the chances to do it.
But the Wolverines wouldn't
die. They won the last three sets,
25-22, 26-24, 32-30.
When Michigan made the
60-mile trip to East Lansing, got
through the rain and cold and
stepped into a packed Jenison
Field House, it knew it was get-
ting into an all-out war. It was
a true test of willpower, of who
wanted the 26th point more, then
the 27th, then the 28th and so on,
until Erwin's final kill dropped
and 6,183 people stood stunned.
In that war, the Wolverines
were playing on the wrong turf
In that war, the Wolverines had
five match points - all they had
to do was finish one.
Of course, the atmosphere
didn't make it easy.
"This has always been really
loud," Toon said. "Ohio State
is really loud, but this is really
loud."

There were so many points at
which Michigan could have fall-
en apart on its rival'shome court.
Starting at 13-12 in the fourth set
- when a Michigan State serve
initially ruled out was overruled
by the referee - Rosen argued
into a yellow card, and then he
sent Erwin over to argue the call.
Of course, it was Erwin with
the kill on the very next point.
The Spartans had the first set
point, and all 6,000 rose and
cheered. Michigan State outside
hitter Lauren Wicinski hit a ball
to the corner. The referee ruled it
out, and the crowd erupted.
From there, everything
descended into turmoil.
A reporter asked Toon after
the game if the game ended up
being decided by who made
the last play. It ended up being
decided by who made the late
play, then another, then another.
"We ran out of subs, so some
people had to play back row that
normallydon't," Erwin said. "We
knew we had to figure out a way
to win."
Toon set up a match point with
a kill, but Michigan State fought
it off with another kill.
Toon set up another match
point with a tip, but Cole com-
mitted two straight hitting
errors to give the Spartans an
opportunity.
"You just have to let things go
really quick," Cole said. "I just
made a couple bonehead mis-
takes at the end, but myteam was
there to cover for me, and that's
what teams do."
Five tension-filled points later,
Erwin finished off the match
with back-to-back kills. Increas-
ingly, as the final points contin-
ued, the fans could not believe
what they were watching.
Yet, 15 minutes later, Rosen
emerged from the locker room,
appearing calm and collected.
"I don't really notice that
(noise)," Rosen said. "I didn't
notice if our band played tonight.
Somebody said they did, but I
don't remember them playing at
all."
The game started off as a
coach's worst nightmare - a
sloppy, gritty slugfest. More than
two hours later, his team won
that sloppy, gritty slugfest.
He took it. He knew his team
kept fighting back. The Wolver-
ines stole the match from the
Michigan State players and the
6,183dfans who witnessed it in
wonder.

For the Daily
EAST LANSING - The Mich-
igan volleyball team traveled
to East Lansing on Wednesday
night for abattle with rival Mich-
igan State. Brisk autumn weather
and patches of rain did nothing
to keep a huge crowd of Spar-
tan fans from packing into Jeni-
son Field
House, MICHIGAN ST
with lines
forming at
the gates more than an hour and
a half before the first serve.
The atmosphere was elec-.
tric, and the tension and energy
between the two teams demon-
strated the usual feelings of ani-
mosity so often associated with
the in-state rivals. Michigan
State used everything it had up its
sleeve in order to "Jam Jenison."
The Spartan cheerleaders, band,
and mascot all made appearances
to fire up the home fans.
A handful of Wolverine band
members sat nestled into the
upper deck of the arena, rally-
ing the small number of maize-
and-blue-clad spectators against
deafening cheers from the Michi-
gan State faithful.
Early on, it looked like the visi-
tors bit off more than they could
chew deep inside enemy terri-
tory.
But none of it ended up mat-
tering, as the Wolverines took
down Michigan State in four sets,
20-25, 25-22, 26-24, 32-30.
The Spartans (6-2 Big Ten,
17-3 overall) started the first set
strong, capitalizing on an early
6-0 runtotake a 13-7 lead. Michi-
gan State's balanced offensive
attack led by senior outside hit-
ter Lauren Wicinski put Michi-
gan (3-5, 13-6) on its heels. After
stretching the lead to 22-15, the
Spartans held off the Wolverines
to take the set, 25-20.
Four Michigan State players
registered multiple kills in the
opening stanza, including three
from Wicinski, and two apiece
for freshman outside hitter Chloe
Reinig and freshman middle
blocker Allyssah Fitterer.
The second set featured a reju-
venated Michigan attack. The
Spartans fought to a 16-12 lead

behind Wicinski and Reinig, but
this time the determined Wol-
verines wouldn't go away. Led by
freshman middle blocker Abby
Cole's five kills, Michigan began
to hit back.
After tying the score at 17, the
teams traded blows. Michigan
State earned a 22-20 lead and
looked ready to close out the set
and put a firm hold on the match,
but a five-point run by the Wol-
verines gave the set to the visi-
tors.
"We practiced a lot of those
pressure situations," said senior
outside hitter Lexi Erwin. "It
was just trusting every player to
do their job."
The third setbecame an all-out.
war to score points, highlighted
by 13 ties and 10 lead changes.
Neither team could build more
than a three-point advantage.
The set grinded on, the score
stayed locked at 20-20 and both
teams grappled for an advantage.
A kill by freshman middle
blocker Autumn Chirstenson
propelled the Spartans to a 24-22
advantage. After a service error
brought Michigan within one, a

Wicinski attack attempt found a
gap in the Wolverine block.
As Michigan State celebrated
what it thought was a successful
kill, the line judge gestured with
his flag, indicating the ball had in
fact landed out of bounds.
After the Spartans thought
they had clinched the third set, a
questionable call gave Michigan
new lifet
Energized by a break in their
favor, the Wolverines rallied
around senior, middle blocker
Jennifer Cross to steal the set,
26-24.
"It was huge. This is a two-
point conference," said senior
outside' hitter Lexi Erwin. "You
don't see teams winning by 10
points."
Added Michigan coach Mark
Rosen: "Early in that third set,
we decided as a team that it
wasn't goingtobe a pretty night."
As they entered the fourth
stanza, little did the Wolverines
knew they were entering into a
30-point slugfest that involved 23
tie scores and 11 lead changes.
Much like the third set, nei-
ther team could gain more than

a three-point lead. The Spartans
grabbed a 21-18 lead, but the
Wolverines struck back to tie the
set, 23-23. After a Wicinski kill
to give the Spartans a set point,
Erwin answered with akill of her
own.
With the score deadlocked,
the two rivals began a series of
vicious rallies, but neither team
could finish off the other. Michi-
gan State fought off four match
points and gave itself two chanc-
es to take the set, but Michigan's
attack led by Erwin and senior
outside hitter Molly Toon finally
overwhelmed the Spartans.
"We just (had) to find a way
to win those dirty, grinded-out
points," Rosen said. "I don'tthink
we played overly well, but in the
end of the day we competed well,
and that meant a lot. We have to
win some that way."
In the first match against the
Spartans of her Michigan career,
Cole anchored the Wolverines
with ateam-high 15 kills.
"It was just another Big Ten
game, we don't want to make
anything big ofit," Cole said with
a smile. "But it was wild."

Michigan's lopsided and
destructive offensive beast

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan's offense was always
relying on the little guy, but it took
a big, big man to make sure that
little guy could shoot up to his
highest potential.
When Michigan finally found
another receivingthreat alongside
fifth-year senior Jeremy Gallon -
who is probably shorter than his
listed height of 5-foot-8 - nobody
thought that the end result would
be the single greatest statistical
receiving performance in the 134
years of Michigan football.
But when sophomore tight end
Devin Funchess split out wide
three games ago, the Wolverines'
offense suddenly became a lot
more dangerous. On Saturday, it
helped Gallon more than anyone.
Before Funchess - who is prob-
ably taller than his listed height of
6-foot-5 - made the transition to
a wide receiver that sometimes
lines up as a tight end instead
of the other way around against
Minnesota, Gallon was getting
little to no help from the other
wide receivers. Through seven
games, there isn't a wide receiver
on the roster with more than eight
catches, other than Gallon and
Funchess.
The results were immediate
for Funchess - 15 catches for 347
yards and three touchdowns inthe
three games since he switched, as
opposed to eight catches for 146
yards and one touchdown in the
four games in which he was used
predominately asa tight end.
And yet, the impact he had in
the shootout win over Indiana
last week was more about how he
helped Gallon than about his own
statistics.
After breaking Michigan and
Big Ten records for receiving
yards in a game (369on14 catches
and two touchdowns); Gallon said
that one of the reasons he was so
open was because the Indiana
defense was afraid of giving up a
big gain to Funchess.
The defense had to pick its poi-
son, and on Saturday, it picked
Gallon. The beauty is that next
week, it might be the other way

Fifth-year senior wide receiver Jeremy Gallon and sophomore tight end Devin Funchess have combined to make Michi-

around.
"There's no question that's a big
part of it," Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said after the game. "The
threat that (Funchess) is vertical-
ly down the field, so I don't think
there's any doubt he had a lot of
attention from Indiana and their
secondary.
That in turn

Even just a
few weeks ago,
there was real concern over Mich-
igan's offense. It was inconsistent
and turnover prone and looked
like it was going to be a real issue
against teams like Michigan State,
Nebraska and Ohio State.
Those issues still might be
valid over the next month, but the
offense is in a much better state

to handle the Wolverines' tough-
est road stretch of the year than it
was even three games ago.
It's impossible to give all that
credit to Funchess, but his posi-
tional switch has been a major
reason for the revitalization of the
offense and not just for the receiv-
ers.
- " Redshirt
junior quar-
lelps terback Devin
Gardner has
er guy also benefited
from having
more than one
bona fide, legit-
imate receiving
target.
In the four games with Funch-
ess playing tight end, Gardner
completed 57.4 percent of his
passes, threw eight interceptions
and just seven touchdowns and
threw for 200 yards per game.
Now, over the last three games,
Gardner has a 66.2-percent com-
pletion rate, with just two inter-

ceptions to go along with six
touchdowns and is throwing for
326 yards per game.
Some of those stats are inflated
because of how awful Indiana's
defense was, but the comparison
still stands.
If Funchess was back in his
previous role, who knows how
the Hoosiers would have covered
Gallon and how that would have
affected the outcome of the game.
Certainly, there would have been
more attention paid to him, as the
secondary was laughably lax in its
coverage, even after Gallon had
hauled in more than 300 receiv-
ing yards.
And maybe when we look back
on this 2013 season, we will look
back on the moment that Funch-
ess became a wide receiver as the
turning point for the offense.
But right now, what we do know
is that there's nothing scarier for a
defense than having to deal with a
two-headed monster, especially if
one head is higher than the other.

When she walked into the
hospital room at Mott, Cole
grabbed the family's attention
for something other than her
6-foot-5 frame - her compassion
for the Walker family was clearly
evident.
"We consider Abby our
friend," said Laura Walker,
Clary's mother. "She has a heart
of compassion and genuine care
for others. We sure look forward
in the months ahead at Mott that
we get to see our friend Abby."
Cole not only makes a signifi-
cant impact on the court, but also

and families as well. The Walk-
ers are an example of that. Cole

"It's the one
thing every week that brightens
everything up and kind of resets

tant," Cole said.
For the Walker family, it's
comforting to know that people
like Cole exist. She somehow
juggles her student workload
on top of a demanding practice
schedule and still finds the time
to visit Mott. Many athletes have
the opportunity to lend a hand,
but for Cole, it's a regular part of
her weekly agenda.
Cole can't wait to see the
Walker family again.
"Now that I've met this boy
Clary, and his sisters, and their
family, I can go back and try to
get on the seventh floor to go see
them again," Cole said.
The Walker family motto is
"No one fights alone," regardless
of whether they are at Mott or on
the volleyball court.

'M' returns to Yost for tough weekend slate

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team is
undefeated, but coach Red Beren-
son isn't exactly pleased.
The fourth-ranked Wolverines
(3-0-1 overall) have been lucky
to win, he says, and they've spent
the year finding ways to not lose.
Relying on good fortune alone
just won't last.
Despite opening the season
with three of four games against
ranked teams, Michigan's sched-
ule doesn't get any easier. It wel-
comes No. 13 Boston University
and No. 18 Massachusetts-Lowell

earned a hard-fought win and
a tie at then-No. 13 New Hamp-
shire.
Meanwhile, Boston Univer-
sity (3-1-0) has played its first four
games at home, and its only blem-
ish came at the hands of No. 12
Rensselaer.
Despite the Wolverines' near-
perfect record, Berenson has
noticed plenty of flaws in the
early season. At RIT, the lopsided
scoreline masked a disastrous
second period in which Michigan
allowed a four-goal lead .to com-
pletely evaporate. And in the first
game against New Hampshire,
the Wolverines were whistled
11 times for penalties and barely
hung on for a tie despite being
horribly out-shot.
Those are issues Berenson has
been trying to correct all week.
Boston University went 3-for-7 on
the power play to dominate Wis-
consin, and Michigan can't afford
to take a period off or spend too
much time down a man.
"The times we've ran into a
little bit of trouble is when we've
been in the box a lot," said senior
defenseman Mac Bennett. "We've
got the stay out of the box, obvi-
ously."
Saturday's game against Mas-
sachusetts-Lowell (1-3-0) won't
be any less of a challenge. Semi-
finalists in last year's Frozen
Four, the River Hawks were the
top-ranked team in the preseason
polls. They lost their first game of
the season in stunning fashion to
Sacred Heart - a team that won
just twice last year - and since
then, Massachusetts-Lowell has
won only once, 5-2 over Massa-
chusetts-Amherst.
But the River Hawks still have
the makings of an elite team.
Netminder Connor Hellebuyck
posted a 1.38 goals-against aver-
age last season, and defenseman
Christian Folin returned to the
team after a stellar freshman year.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Senior defenseman Mac Bennett leads an undefeated team into a tough weekend.

"We've gotta get our feet mov-
ing on Friday, and then we'll
worry about Saturday," Beren-
son said. "These are both top-10
teams."
That challenge excites Beren-
son, and he says it'll help the Wol-
verines when the grueling Big Ten
season begins in late November.
"If we were fooling ourselves
and playing weak teams week
after week, whether we're win-
ning or losing, we're going to have
some false sense of confidence or
security," Berenson said. "There's
no place to hide right now. We're
playing good teams, and you can

The sun isn't up yet, but already the large multipurpose
room has lots of tired-looking people eating breakfast, talk-
ing and beginning their days. The room is filled with about
100 patrons, mostly sitting around circular tables on fold-
up white chairs. A piano sits on one wall, and the edge of a
curtained stage has been co-opted into a lean-and-eat area.
Hot oatmeal, grits and pastries are served buffet-style,
right from the kitchen. A table with coffee, spreads and
cereal is popular, and a toast-and-butter station is also set
up.
Diners drink coffee from different styles of mugs, break
open hard-boiled eggs and munch on the food. Some tables
are loud with conversation about last night's game, someone
retelling a crazy story, complaining about Michigan's too-
cold weather or even where to find a job. Others are silent
with people just eating or staring into the distance. Some
are dressed nice and have smartphones and iPods; others
look shabby and have multiple layers of ragged clothes.
The breakfast, in some ways, is completely normal, and
the same scene could easily be seen at West Quad or in a
Kerrytown co-op. Old friends reconnect, and new table
groups form.
However, this is not your typical breakfast: It's the free
breakfast program at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church,
which is a nonprofit organizationthat serves disadvantaged
individuals a morning meal seven days a week.

Since 1982, the breakfast program has been divvying
out free breakfast to all who come. Volunteers and patrons
can't remember a single day when breakfast wasn't avail-
able. A few years ago, an outage left much of southeastern
Michigan without power. All was not lost for the breakfast
streak: Candles were placed on tabletops, and breakfast was
still provided. When St. Andrew's temporarily closes for
renovations or new wiring, the program moves to a nearby'
Methodist church, said program director Shannon Chase.
Between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. every dayof the week, every-
one is welcome to come, eat breakfast and relax for the
hour. Located across the street from Community High
School, the large, gothic Episcopal Church complete with
a tall tower has white text painted on a window giving the
hours for the breakfast program.
The program was started by members ofthe St. Andrew's
congregation and quickly expanded from a weekend pro-
gram to a daily event. In recent years, the program has
become its own separate nonprofit organization and now
rents its space from the church. Many church members are
still actively involved in the organization, but plenty of vol-
unteers are not affiliated with the church.
Most volunteers are retirees or University students, but
some work full time. Others are students from a nearby
high school. Chase said she helps manage hundreds of vol-
unteers throughout the year with varying levels of commit-

ment.
In 31 years, the program has deliberately remained con-
sistent. The organization wants to accomplish its one job
and do it right.
"I think it's easy to spread ourselves too thin," Chase
said. "So we just focus on breakfast every day of the week,
every week of the year."
People simply walk in. No registration is required, nor is
proof of income of any kind. Some come for a single meal or
just a few weeks' worth, while others have been eating here
daily for years. For many diners, the simplicity is a great
benefit of the program. It allows for them to come and leave
when needed - no questions asked.
Azula is a 20-year-old who said he is struggling finan-
cially and comes to the program for both a good breakfast
and to interact with the people. At the breakfast program,
patrons commonly know each other by only their first
names.
"A lot of people forget how to ration their money and use
it for the right things, and that's why this is a bigsupportto
them in this community," Azula said.
For some other local programs, there is a time limit or
other requirement such as staying clean or mandatory job-
seeking. This program has no stich rules, and it's extremely
easy to take advantage of it - just show up.

They'll walk by left and right,
places to go there and here and
there. But everyone seems to
take their steps just a little slow-
er. It is fall, you know.
The more you leave down-
town, the less of the "here and
there's" you see. Ann Arbor
unfolds into the quiet trees
and winding sidewalks of the
suburbs. Most students, dur-
ing their four- or five-year
stay, probably don't wander
too far off the downtown map.
But sometimes, it's nice to get
lost in Burns Park or the Old
West Side for reasons of which
I'm not entirely sure. Maybe
downtown and campus are too
inscribed with the school-day
schedule, and it's nice to get
away. Maybe, for students, it
never feels like you've seen all
of Ann Arbor, and there's an
urge to venture off. So much

of the town is hidden away in
the sleepy corners or down the
long, riverside roads. Town-
ies, I apologize, but I'm about
to hype up one of the gems you
have folded away outside of
town.
The Last Word, Circus, 8
Ball, Blind Pig and Kiwanis
probably form the farthest edge
of town for most students. But
if you're willing to take the
hike a few blocks further West
(and in the fall weather, why
not?), you'll reach Jefferson's
Market. It's in a rather interest-
ing side of town. Amid the rows
of houses are an old church, an
elementary school and some
spacious University buildings
that feel like the downtown ,
area might re-emerge among
the trees, yet doesn't.
It's not a large space by any
means: less than a dozen tables,
with an open kitchen, and for
a long while, Joy Division and
New Order playing on the regu-
lar (please bring that back).
While it wouldn't have been
feasible for most students to go
to Jefferson's Market a year ago
- it only served lunch during
the weekdays - recently, the
cafe has begun serving brunch
on Saturdays and Sundays with
its own brunch-style dishes.
I usually order the Mt. Rush-
more, a scramble of vegetables,
eggs and hash browns, but
sometimes I'll split that along
with an order of their specialty
french toast or pancakes with
a friend. The menu has its
staples, but it also has seasonal

g Irid
rotations to mix things up. And
for the coffee lovers, expect
spot-on, local brews for your
morning wake-up.
in addition to its weekday
lunch and weekend brunch-
hour eats, Jefferson's Market
also has a bakery and cake
shop. I can't speak from experi-
ence here, but if anyone reading
this happens to be on the look-
out for a wedding cake, first
of all, congratulations on your
engagement and, second, look
no further.
It seems as if there is no real
reason to leave downtown Ann
Arbor. So much is condensed
into the area that one could
certainly be occupied during
their temporary stay. But for
some, this may be the only time
one lives in Ann Arbor. For
that reason, why not go on an
adventure to break up the rou-
tine or even find new routines?
For me, Jefferson's Market pro-
vides new tastes and scenes for
the second half of my stay.
With a to-go cup of coffee
in my hand and the beat of
"Temptation" by New Order
in my head, walking out of the
market is one of the lasting
pleasures of the place. You're
not thrown into the mix. You
have time to stroll through
the shady suburban streets
and take a breath for a second.
Especially during midterms, it's
nice to know that life goes on.

may be one of the only places

how she sometimes might not

they can come together at St.

"We are able here to allow for
people to stay for an hour and
sit," Mary said. "I do see a sense
of community; I do see people
sitting together in this group or
that group."
Serving all
The breakfast program serves
a huge spectrum of people of all
ages and races and needs. Each
breakfast is extremely diverse
with many different ages and
races represented. The needs of
each individual also vary sig-
nificantly. Many have alcohol
or drug addictions, and some
have mental disabilities. Deal-
ing with this large sample of
humanity all in one room does
sometimes cause issues.
Halfway through one break-
fast, Chase stood up and loud-
ly blew a whistle. Everyone
respectfully got quiet and lis-
tened; this had clearly happened
before. Chase announced some-
one had drawn graffiti in the
bathroom and that it might be
closed if the behavior doesn't
stop. Some sighed while others
groaned. All those interviewed
said the program was kept very
calm and safe. Any issues are
quickly dealt with.
The number of people fed
daily ranges from 70 to 140,
Chase said. There doesn't seem
to be a clear trend, and it's very
hard to predict the number
of mouths to feed and so the
yearly expenditure changes
a lot. According to Chase, the
organization is in the process
of attracting more corporate
donors and grants so that the
program doesn't have to rely
on small personal donations as
much.
Whether the program is fund-
ed by church members or cor-
porate grants, all those in need
will be able to fill their stomachs
and reach a friendly community
for years to come.
"They're doing something
right," Carl said. "I mean they've
been doing it since '82, so they're
doing something right here."

Snoop Dogg may be known
for his acting roles,
various product endorse-
ments, hilarious lingo and jaw-
dropping marijuana intake, but
once upon'
a time - 20
years ago as
of next month
- the rapper
then known
as Snoopp
Doggy Dogg
changed hip
hop with his JACKSON
debut album HOWARD
Doggystyle:
The signifi-
cance of Doggystyle on Snoop
Dogg's career, West Coast
gangsta rap, Dr. Dre and hip
hop as a mtsical genre, among
other things, is momentous.
Before he was Snoop, Calvin
Broadus was a 22-year-old,
drug-dealing Crip from Long
Beach, Calif. However, upon
being discovered by Dr. Dre and
placed on the now-legendary
track "Deep Cover," Snoop's
nasally voice, complex flow
and undeniable swagger had
the hip-hop world buzzing. His
hype only increased with his
show-stopping performances
on Dre's classic album The
Chronic, where he appeared on
many of the album's songs and
ghostwrote most of Dre's raps.
Coming into 1993, the anticipa-
tion for Doggystyle was unbe-
lievably high.
The album carried over Dre's
signature G-funk sound from
The Chronic, drawing influ-
ences from funk bands such
as Funkadelic, Parliament and
Zapp & Roger, as well as find-
ing inspiration in West Coast
Los Angeles culture, full of
women, weed and weather. By
working only with Dr. Dre on
the project, Snoop established
a cohesive sound that is still
uncommon in hip hop. This
cohesive sound, though, didn't
only depend on Dre. Working
on his first record, Snoop had
the ability to really collaborate
with anyone he wanted and
used that freedom to bring in
the only people he knew. Daz,
Kurupt, Nanci Fletcher, RBX,
Jewell, Lady of Rage, Warren
G and Nate Dogg - all long-
time friends of Snoop - joined
forces in a completely natural
way to form Doggystyle. This
myriad of guests not only gave
the album its unique sound, but
also challenged Snoop lyrically.
Artists like Kurupt and Lady of
Rage especially were renowned
lyrical assassins, and some
of the best verses of Snoop's
career come on songs where he
trades bars with them.
OK, you get it; this was an
important album, Dr. Dre did
some cool stuff on it and Snoop
became famous, whatever.
But why is Doggystyle still
considered by many as one of
the greatest hip-hop albums
of all time and one of the best
albums released in the 1990s?
Why, though his career took

off, hadn't Snoop ever made an
album this good? Why can't I
just write entire columns full of
rhetorical questions (I so would
if I could)?
Let's start with a couple
songs. "Gin and Juice" might
have one of the most memo-
rable choruses in rap his-
tory: "Rollin down the street,
smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and
juice / laid back / with my mind
on my money and my money on
my mind." "Gin and Juice" is a
view into Snoop's ideal house
party, filled with Seagram's
gin, ladies from Long Beach
and Compton and "some bubon-
ic chronic that made me choke."
Doggystyle is full of gems like
this - the smash single "Who
Am I (What's My Name?)" is
classic G-funk, while "Ain't
No Fun (If the Homies Can't
Have None)" features maybe
the best Nate Dogg verse of all
time. Dre's UFO synths, funky
bass and thumping drums cre-
ated the perfect soundscape for
Snoop's syncopated, rhythmic
flow.
For all its party music,
however, Doggystyle is still
known for its incredible lyri-
cism. Kurupt absolutely slayed
every song he jumped on. Take
"Serial Killa": "It's time to
escape, but I don't know where
the fuck I'm headed / Up or
down, right of left, life or death
/ I see myself in a mist of smoke
/ Death becomes any nigga that
takes me for a joke," he spits on
the song's first verse.
The lyrics are explicit, vio-
lent and sexist, and Snoop
received his fair share of criti-
cism for the album's content.
Even today, the lyrics of some
songs are tough to read out
loud, as they celebrate a society
in which women are simply
objects utilized for whatever
a man wants in the moment.
What Snoop would say to this,
and I agree, is that he was sim-
ply narrating his life story. You
have to understand that in his
culture - 1990s Long Beach
gang life - this is simply how
it was. This isn't an excuse, but
it does help understand why
Snoop said the things he did.
Hip hop is the genre that it is
due to this transparency: Rap-
pers rap about what they see
and what they live. Snoop's tale
of life on the streets certainly
shocked the public, but you
can't say he wasn't telling the
truth.
This point is only reinforced
by one of Doggystyle's most
famous tracks, "Murder Was
the Case (Death After Visualiz-
ing Eternity)." Around the time
of the album's release, Snoop
was charged in connection with
an actual murder. Though he
was eventually found innocent,
the trial had a profound effect
on him, and he released these
feelings in his music.
More, Dr. Dre and Fab Five
Freddy actually made a short
film in 1994 starring Snoop
called Murder Was the Case,

which featured music from
Snoop and a story about Snoop's
death and resurrection by
making a deal with the devil.
Snoop's storytelling is at an
all-time high here: "As I look
up at the sky / My mind starts
tripping / A tear drops my eye /
My body temperature falls / I'm
shaking and they breaking try-
ing to save the Dogg."
Other classics, like "Lodi
Dodi," "Tha Shiznit," "Serial
Killa" and "Gz and Hustlas,"
among others, still remain
in many listeners' rotation
(including yours truly's). Dog-
gystyle embodied not only life
through Snoop's eyes, but also
life in general for a man in his
young 20s, tryingto figure it all
out. In addition, Snoop, along-
side N.W.A., 2Pac and others,
broughtback the West Coast at a
time when the only "legitimate"
hip hop was seen to be from the
East Coast. Though the East-
West feud between Puff Daddy's
Bad Records (with The Notori-
ous B.IG.) and Suge Knight's
Death Row Records (with Snoop
and 2Pac) ultimately had tragic
consequences, it greatly height-
ened hip hop's popularity dur-
ing a crucial era in which hip
hop was still being debated as a
serious art form.
So, what about Snoop? Since
1993, he's endorsed Adidas,
made songs with Katy Perry
and briefly changed his name
to Snoop Lion. He's released 10
more studio albums, 17 com-
pilations and 127 singles, and
sold over 30 million albums
worldwide. Yes, he's been suc-
cessful. Nonetheless, Doggystyle
remains his best reviewed and
highest selling project and will
most likely stay that way. Dre's
presence was crucially absent
from Snoop's next album, 1996's
The Doggfather, due to Dre's
falling-out with Suge Knight.
Snoop then released three sub-
par albums on Master P's No
Limit Records and bounced
around from Priority to Gef-
fen to Phanrell's Star Trak in
the last 10 years. A few of his
albums, including The Dog-
gfather, 2002's Paid tha Cost to
Be da Boss and 2006's Tha Blue
Carpet Treatment, are still qual-
ity albums, and his numerous
appearances on Dr. Dre's sextu-
ple-platinum, landmark album
2001 are some of the best guest
spots in rap history. Today,
Snoop is a public figure known
by preteens and gangsters alike,
a man of a million identities who
is as much pop as he is rap.
That's fine. I'm happy for
Snoop. I still enjoy his other
music ("Beautiful" is one of my
favorite songs ever). But still,
nothing compares to Doggystyle,
a G-funk masterpiece filled
with misogyny, partying, West
Coast lingo and a whole lot of
that genuine Snoop Doggy Dogg
flavor.

Though it began as a place for just coffee and crepes, Cafe Zola has expanded to include a dinner menu.

Owners Hediye Batu's and Alan Zakalik's Turkish and Polish heritage influences the cuisine at Zola.


Zola is located on Washington Street, next to the Grizzly Peak Brewing Company.

The restaurant is best known for its diverse selection of crepes.

Zola finds right recipe for brunch

Caf6 offers more
than just crepes
and coffee
By CONRAD FOREMAN
Daily Arts Writer
Brunch (noun): the mystical
meal that bridges breakfast for the
late-risers with lunch for the early
birds in a hellacious fury of scrum-
diddlyumptiousness.
Brunch is a wonderful thing. At
any joint with agood brunch menu,
the spread includes everything
from standard scrambled eggs to
artisan sandwiches and a plethora
of deliciousness in between.
It was on a cold Monday that I
set out for a perfect brunch-date
experience at Cafe Zola, a place I'd
heard about from several people
but had never visited myself. To
me, it had always been one ofthose
places, to borrow a phrase from
Yogi Berra, where nobody goes
because it's alwaystoo crowded.

Our timing onthis day couldn't
have been better, though, as we
walked into a mostly empty Zola
(apparently other people don't
think 3 o'clock is a normal meal
time - poppycock). We were
promptly seated and left with
water, menus and the daunting
task of deciding what to order.
I'd never tried crepes before,
so I ordered the complete savory
crepe -filled with egg, ham and
cheese - with a side of pota-
toes, of course (Breakfast!). My
lady friend chose the Italian
sandwich (Lunch!). I also got
a cappuccino, because I like to
pretend to be an adult when I go
out to eat.
I devoured my crepe and
potatoes while, across the table,
someone could only finish half
of her loaded sandwich (no com-
plaints on her part - she had
won the leftover lottery).
After our tummies were filled
and our plates cleared, I had
the chance to chat with Lucia
Lagoy, the assistant to the own-

ers, Hediye Batu and Alan Zaka-
lik. First things first, I had to ask
about the enormous menu.
"They designed the place to
be a cafe that did crepes and cof-
fee," Lagoy said. "That's kind of
how it started. We didn't have
the dinner menu until about
five years ago; they added that
later on. Over time, they built
the menu, but it started off as a
smaller operation."
Crepes and coffee ... sounds
oddly familiar. So what was
the inspiration for this expan-
sion from a simple coffee-and-
crepes place to the smorgasbord
of foods from all over the world
that Zola offers today?
"Hediye is Turkish, and Alan
is Polish," Lagoy explained. "And.
they have a lot of international
friends."
Variety is all well and good,
but what really makes a great
restaurant is the quality, not
quantity, of the menu options. Of
course, Cafe Zola offers an abun-
dance of both.

"One thing I'd want to empha-
size about our menu here is that
everything is either made in-
house, or we get it from the very
best suppliers," Lagoy said. "Our
maple syrup comes from a com-
pany in Michigan, up north. We
could get maple syrup from Ver-
mont, but we get it from Michi-
gap because we try to support
local businesses when we can,
but we're always looking for the
best ingredients."
Lagoy went on to rave about
some of her favorite brunch menu
items.
"We make eggs right," she
said. "Our potatoes are delicious.
They're not hash browns; they're
roasted rosemary potatoes, cut
really well - we cut them by
hand."
Not even the coffee was free
from her ringing praise.
"It comes from a company
called La Colombe. ... They just
make amazing coffee, and they're
also a company that's really into
ethics and helping out communi-

ties."
But those are Lagoy's taste
buds speaking. What do the peo-
ple love? According to Lagoy, the
Turkish eggs and the crab cake
benedict are two of the most pop-
ular items on the brunch menu,
along with the farmhouse and
artichoke omelets.
Of course, a bad atmosphere
can ruin even the best of meals.
But even here Zola excels, pro-
viding a friendly experience and
interesting decoration, including
a diverse set of pictures lining
the walls and a concrete bar.
"At Zola, we strive to give
somebody a whole experience,"
Lagoy said. "It's not just about
the atmosphere; it's not just
about the food and the service.
Our staff, our team, what we look
for is to give someone an overall
great experience. From the food,
to the drinks, to the service, to
the atmosphere, to the conversa-
tion, we just want them to come
here and (say), 'Wow, that was a
really nice meal that I had. And

not just because the food was
good.'"
Being on the other side of
Main Street from campus, Cafe
Zola maAages to stay off the
map for many students who keep
their Ann Arbor wanderings
close to campus. But while Zola
is perhaps more popular among
grown-up Ann Arbor, that
doesn't mean it lacks student cli-
entele.
"We get a little bit of every-
body," Lagoy said. "We have a
pretty strong base of regular
customers..... We do get a lot of
student business, too. We get a
lot of students who bring their
parents..... I'd say we get avery
diverse clientele. Our menu is big
enough that we have something
for everybody."
Indeed, Cafe Zola has some-
thing to offer even the pickiest of
brunch-munchers. The diverse
menu, complemented by fresh
ingredients and friendly service,
makes brunch at Zola a rich Ann
Arbor restaurant experience.
