As Ann Arbor received a 
rcord number of absentee ballot 
requests ahead of Tuesday’s 
primary 
elections, 
in-person 
voting dwindled. Throughout the 
day, The Daily visited multiple 
precincts and found few voters 
at many locations. Ann Arbor’s 
online Election Day line tracker 
reported little to no wait times. 
University of Michigan Law 
student Sam Rubinstein has been 
working the polls on election 
days since he moved to Ann 
Arbor in 2018. Administering an 
election for the second time as 
precinct chairperson Tuesday, he 
wanted to make sure the second 
precinct in Ward 3 ran smoothly 
and safely. 
The city of Ann Arbor worked 
with the University to use a 
bigger space for the polls in 
the Michigan League, which is 
otherwise closed. Rubenstein 
noted 
the 
city 
implemented 
protective 
measures 
like 
plexiglass between workers and 
voters; N-95 face masks and 
gloves for workers; and sanitizing 
voting booths after each use. 
“But obviously the biggest 

difference is that there’s very few 
people here, because people have 
been encouraged to vote by mail, 
and it’s good to see people taking 
advantage of that even if it’s a bit 
quiet here,” Rubinstein said. 
Rubinstein said he doesn’t 
know 
whether 
the 
safety 
measures in place today will 
be sustainable in the general 
election 
when 
students 
are 
presumably back on campus and 
turnout is much higher.
“It’ll be harder to sustain,” 
Rubinstein said. “I’m confident 
that we’re practicing good social 
distancing today, but it’s easy 
when you have such a small 
number of people.”
Election 
workers 
outnumbered voters throughout 
the day at the League. By 11 
a.m., four hours after polls 
opened, election worker Joan 
Lowenstein had only seen one 
voter, a Daily reporter who was 
at their 3rd Ward 1st Precinct 
station. Lowenstein said about 20 
absentee ballots were sent out to 
the precinct, which is nearly all
students.
“We expected it to be pretty 
slow because of the big push 
for absentee ballots this year,” 
Lowenstein said. “... I know that 
each ward in Ann Arbor had 
more absentee ballots requested 
than total voters in 2018.”

Edward 
Golembiewski, 
Washtenaw County Director of 
Election, confirmed this rise in 
an email to The Daily, stating 
101,807 absentee ballots were 
sent across the county and 34,519 
have been issued for the city of 
Ann Arbor.
Even 
though 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident Chris Vessels received 
an absentee ballot, he voted 
in-person because he was driving 
by the League. Vessels said he 
is also worried about bigger 
elections, but said the socially-
distanced voting didn’t affect his 
experience much Tuesday. 
“This would be a nightmare 
if there were a big line out the 
door, and I’m sure for the general 
election it’s gonna be kind of 
tough, but for something where 
you’re the only person in here 
it’s really not such a big deal,” 
Vessels said. 
Vessels said he voted for 
candidates who he feels will 
encourage 
more 
housing 
development in Ann Arbor.

A pandemic primary: How voters 
and poll workers experienced elections

Dominick Sokotoff/Daily

 Democrats Lisa Disch, Linh Song, 
Travis Radina, Jen Eyer and Erica 
Briggs won Ann Arbor City Council 
seats in the 1st through 5th Wards, 
respectively, 
beating 
incumbents. 
All City Council seats will be held by 
Democrats. All five challengers were 
endorsed by Mayor Christopher Taylor, 
and these results will give him a council 
majority.
Ward 1 - Lisa Disch 
Disch won Ward 1’s seat with 
approximately 68 percent of the vote 
against incumbent Anne Bannister. 
She has lived in Ward 1 since 2008 and 
is a professor in the Political Science 
and Women’s Studies Departments at 
the University of Michigan. According 
to her website, she is a “life-long 
Democrat.”
Her goals for the future include 
making sure Ann Arbor has affordable 
housing options, restarting Ann Arbor’s 
commitment to recycling, pursuing 
renewable energy solutions, increasing 
pedestrian safety and strengthening 
relationships between citizens and the 
police. 
In a statement on Facebook, Disch 
noted how grateful she is for the 
opportunity to serve on Ann Arbor City 
Council and gave her thanks to the Ann 
Arbor community for supporting her. 
“Now the work begins,” Disch wrote. 
“But that does not mean that I disappear 
from the neighborhoods. As I said in my 
newsletter last week, you all will find 
me knocking on your doors again come 
Fall in support of the affordable housing

has supported this campaign will join

LSA instructors 
prepare for a mostly 
virtual fall semester 

As the University of Michigan 
campus gears up for a “public 
health-informed 
in-residence 
semester” this fall, departments and 
instructors have had to decide how 
to hold their classes while aligning 
with University guidelines.
For LSA, these guidelines means 
large classes over 45 will be fully 
online, and smaller classes have the 
option to be in-person, hybrid or 
fully online, according to LSA Dean 
Anne Curzan.
According 
to 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald, 
faculty 
and 
leadership 
within 
their individual departments and 
schools are best positioned to decide 
the most effective way to deliver 
courses.
“Each school or college will make 
the final decision on classroom 
capacity based on the needs of the 
class and the specific configuration 
of the space,” Fitzgerald said. “All 
this is being done, of course, to follow 
public health guidance of providing 
a minimum of 36 square feet of space 
per person in the classroom, with 
more space required for courses that 
require students to move around or 
be there for longer periods of time.”
According 
to 
recent 
correspondence from University 
President Mark Schlissel, the Ann 
Arbor Registrar’s Office is working 
to post online information that 
indicates what mode of instruction 
individual courses will be taught in. 
Students will be able to adjust their 
course selections beginning Aug. 7.
The Daily Web Team compiled 
data from the LSA Course Guide 
and found that, as of Aug. 2, nearly 
68 percent of classes are listed as 
online courses, with approximately 
18 percent being listed as in-person 
and 13 percent as hybrid.
In an interview with the Daily last 
month, Prof. Marcus Ammerlaan, 
who taught the introductory lab 

course Biology 173 last winter, 
expressed the difficulty of teaching 
a large lab class online.
“The instructor, obviously, is 
going to be older than most of the 
students and that in itself is a risk 
factor,” Ammerlaan said. “So you 
don’t want to see an instructor 
getting affected by an asymptomatic 
student and then pass that infection 
on through GSIs (Graduate Student 
Instructors) and to other sections.”
Lecturer Carly Nowicki, who will 
be teaching Biology 173 in the fall 
and is currently teaching it during 
the summer semester, decided to 
make the class online in the fall. 
According to Nowicki, there are 
about 700 students enrolled in the 
course and 17-18 GSIs each semester. 
Because of this large class size, she 
felt she could not wait until the last 
minute to make decisions.
“It was me having separate 
conversations with the laboratory 
support 
staff,” 
Nowicki 
said. 
“Those are the people that are the 
frontlines. They’re the ones that are 
exposed to every lab, and so I had 
frank conversations with some of 
those people to get their thoughts on 
how they feel, outside of what any 
administration felt.”
With 
the 
summer 
semester 
being the first time the course is 
running fully online, Nowicki said 
the class was rewritten to include a 
combination of students performing 
labs at home with simple household 
items, virtual lab simulations and 
watching videos.
“Every video demo I’ve done 
has been in my own home because 
that’s where students are going to 
be performing (the experiments),” 
Nowicki said.
Rackham 
student 
Annaliese 
Keiser will be a GSI in the Math 
Department for the fall semester. 
Though she doesn’t know what 
classes she will be teaching yet, she 
said she knows she will be teaching 
remotely, as the Math Department 
decided that all the courses typically 
taught by GSIs would be conducted 
remotely.

Students respond to the 
WilmerHale report of 
Philbert’s misconduct

Friday morning, the University 
of Michigan community awoke to 
an email announcing the release 
of the WilmerHale report, sent to 
students, University officials, the 
Board of Regents and the public 
simultaneously. The investigation, 
conducted by the WilmerHale 
law firm, uncovered decades of 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
and harassment against former 
University 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, as well as numerous 
instances in which University 
administrators were made aware 
of allegations prior to when the 
investigation opened in January.
Many students have reacted to 
the findings of the investigation 
with 
anger, 
frustration 
and 
disappointment — but many are 
not surprised, they told The Daily. 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Nora 
Hilgart-Griff referenced a string 
of alleged abusers from the 
University’s recent past — from 
the late athletic doctor Robert 
Anderson 
to 
former 
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
professor 
Stephen Shipps — as she discussed 
her own lack of surprise at the 
contents of the report. She said 
the years of allegations against 
Philbert reassert the University’s 
disappointing progress toward 
creating an environment free of 
sexual harassment and violence 
on campus.
“We want to see these things 
as maybe part of an ugly past 
or part of a different culture,” 
Hilgart-Griff said. “Colleges and 

universities have maybe come a 
long way, but they’re still by and 
large institutions of privilege … 
(and of) wealth and whiteness and 
maleness, and I think that can’t 
help but show. So I am horrified 
and unsurprised at the same time, 
which I think is a really frustrating 
conjunction of emotions.”
The report arrived six months 
after 
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel first announced 
the 
University 
had 
received 
allegations against Philbert and 
had placed him on leave. Some 
students saw the public release of 
the WilmerHale report as a step in 
the right direction, while others 
pointed to inconsistencies between 
the claims to transparency and the 
contents of the report itself. 
 LSA and Music, Theatre & 
Dance junior Andrew Gerace 
voiced 
skepticism 
about 
the 
University’s 
efforts 
toward 
transparency.
“The 
University 
is 
very 
comfortable 
using 
the 
term 
‘transparency’ 
when 
they’re 
saying things like, ‘Oh, we have 
sent this report to you … as part of 
our commitment to transparency’ 
— however, everything that the 
report documented was non-
transparent,” Gerace said.
LSA junior Emma Sandberg 
similarly 
noted 
that 
other 
institutional 
barriers 
to 
transparency remain. Sandberg 
is the founder of Roe v. Rape, a 
nonprofit advocacy group for 
survivors of sexual assault on 
campus that works to challenge 
several of the University’s existing 
sexual misconduct policies.
“I 
really 
appreciate 
the 
University’s transparency in this 
case; it’s so important that they

WilmerHale 
released 
its 
88-page report of its independent 
investigation of allegations of 
sexual misconduct by former Uni-
versity of Michigan Provost Mar-
tin Philbert Friday. The report
found “significant evidence” that 
Philbert violated the Universi-
ty’s Sexual Harassment policy. It 
identified numerous times when 
University personnel and adminis-
tration received information about 
Philbert’s sexual misconduct. 
“Two things are clear: First, 
there is significant evidence that 
Philbert engaged in a wide range 
of sexual misconduct, including 
sexual harassment, for at least 
fifteen years,” the report reads. 
“Second, 
neither 
OIE 
(Office 
of Institutional Equity) nor the 
senior leadership of the University 
understood the seriousness or the 
pervasiveness of Philbert’s mis-
conduct.”
WilmerHale began its inde-
pendent investigation in January 
2020. After six months, Wilmer-
Hale 
investigators 
interviewed 
128 people, some multiple times, 
including 
current 
and 
former 
employees, former students and 
current and former University 
administrators. 
The report finds that Philbert 
normalized 
his 
inappropriate 
behavior and intimidated women 
who may have sought to report 
him. 
“Philbert had expressly threat-
ened some of them—one witness, 
who in fact was in a relationship 
with Philbert, told us that he said: 
‘If you ever tell anyone about us, I 
will make sure you go down. I will 
destroy your career,’” the report 
reads.
The report alleges Philbert sex-
ually harassed multiple members 
of the University community while 

he was an assistant professor, an 
associate dean, School of Public 
Health dean and provost. In his 
early years at the University, Phil-
bert allegedly harassed women 
who worked in his research lab, 
making comments about their 
bodies, redirecting conversations 
toward sex and insisting on get-
ting hugs. The report found Phil-
bert engaged in simultaneous 
sexual relationships with at least 
two University employees, and 
sometimes more, during his tenure 
as Provost. He stored nude photos 
of these women on University-
owned devices and had “sexual 
contact” with them in University 
offices often. 
The report was released to both 
the University and the public at 
the same time. In an email to The 
Daily, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University is 
reviewing the results from the 
report.
“We have just begun to careful-
ly review the full report and take 
all of its findings into account,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “Yet, it is clear 
in the executive summary that the 
WilmerHale report – released pub-
licly today at the same time it was 
shared with university officials – 
contains a shocking description of 
improper and unacceptable behav-
ior by a university officer as well 
as failings by this institution. We 
will do everything in our power 
to prevent such misconduct from 
ever happening again at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.”
In 2003, a male lab employee, 
Tom Komorowski, was terminated 
by Philbert. He reported to Uni-
versity officials he was fired over 
a female lab employee because 
of her and Philbert’s close, per-
sonal relationship. A senior Pub-
lic Health School faculty member 
questioned Philbert about the 
alleged relationship and did not

On Sept. 2, 2019, The Daily 
reported on the University of 
Michigan University Health Ser-
vice’s controversial move to dis-
continue coverage of sexually 
transmitted infection testing for 
students to be included in tuition. 
Two days later, an online peti-
tion demanding reinstatement of 
coverage for STI testing was in 
circulation — and already at 1,400 
signatures. Two days after that, 
the University announced its plan 
to reverse its policy and reinstated 
coverage for the testing. In a mat-
ter of four days, the student orga-
nizers’ demands had been met. 
While petitions and student 
activism are not rare at the Uni-
versity, this example of swift 
administrative response to the 
demands of a petition is relatively 
atypical. With multiple petitions 
currently in circulation concern-
ing the University’s plans for the 
upcoming school year that have 
yet to be addressed, it raises ques-
tions about what makes student 
petitions effective.
In a 2019 interview with The 
Daily, E. Royster Harper, former 

vice president for Student Life, 
commented on the varying suc-
cess of student activism following 
the STI testing petition’s favorable 
outcome. Harper highlighted the 
many factors University adminis-
trators weigh when making deci-
sions, including both financial 
decisions for the University and 
the needs of the student.
“I think usually when the Uni-
versity makes a decision, there are 
multiple things that they are try-
ing to get accomplished,” Harper 
said. “In this case, (those factors 
were) money and making sure the 
students get good health care … So 
what the University is weighing 
is, when we consider everything, 
where do we need to be? Some-
times what we decide is, we can’t 
change. This is not one of those, 
because when we put every-
thing together, it makes sense to 
change.”
University alum Hoai An Pham, 
one of the authors of the petition to 
reinstate coverage for STI testing, 
said part of what made that peti-
tion particularly effective in rally-
ing student support especially was 
its clear identification of individu-
al student’s stake in the decision. 
As a digital organizer and author 
of multiple petitions in her time 
at the University, including peti-
tions demanding fair contracts for 
lecturers and opposing Richard 
Spencer’s request to speak at the 
University, Pham reflected on the 

effect of privilege on student sup-
port for different activist efforts.
“I think that at times, the privi-
lege of the student body in gen-
eral, and the privilege of being a 
university student in general … 
creates a barrier for students to 
understand their role in certain 
issues, and the specific action they 
can take to be pushing towards 
any kind of resolution or justice,” 
Pham said.
Despite these and other limita-
tions, including the critique that 
signing petitions can merely serve 
as virtue-signaling, Pham also 
emphasized the accessibility of 
petitions and other digital forms 
of engagement. 
“Oftentimes I think people 
view 
petitions 
as 
standalone, 
which is I think how they do get 
the reputation of like, signing the 
petition won’t do anything,” Pham 
said. “(But) there is an ableist 
component of that … As a disabled 
organizer I’m always like, ‘Well, 
digital organizing is really impor-
tant, and there’s a lot of power 
that we can build behind it.’”
LSA senior Morgan McCaul, 
an organizer at the University 
who focuses on students’ rights 
regarding Title IX policies, also 
emphasized the role petitions 
play in digital organizing. McCaul 
authored a petition demanding 
the University commit to survi-

or traditional practices in mind — where 
millions of Africans were stolen from 
their families and their homes and 
brought to the Americas through the 
transatlantic slave trade. Society at 
large thinks of chattel slavery and 
dehumanization as something of the 
past, something centuries away from 
us all. Slavery is not a historical event. 
It exists in many forms today — it is 
ingrained in our existing social system. 
Whether it be America’s incarceration 
system, debt bondage, child labor — in 
manufacturing, domestic and sex work 
— or global slave trade through methods 
of human trafficking, slavery was never 
effectively abolished as so many have 
the privilege to believe. 
We as consumers have been com-
pletely complicit participants in this 
slavery. From our phones, to our clothes, 
to our coffee and rice, we are constantly 
consuming the product of forced labor 
and slavery. As globalization progresses 
— the modern movement which encour-
ages the collaboration of nations in inno-
vation and content creation — we see 
developments in economic wealth and 
effective industry. However, these eco-
nomic benefits intensely feed the capi-
talist economy, nourishing the already 
rich and further enslaving laborers. As 
demand for cheap everyday products 
increases, the value of human labor 
decreases. This demand comes from us 
as the consumer. And with that power, 
we must ask ourselves what is more 
important to us not in the moment, but 
in life: the price of your phone or the life 
of the child mining cobalt to get it to you 
within your budget. 
Complacency manifests quickly with 
the help of social media. When compa-
nies like Nike release one ad that demon-
strates no actual action toward or pursuit 
of racial equity and justice, and all of 
social media’s civilian consumers praise 
that ad release, the social system is not 
disturbed, nor is the company. If instead 
of praising this bare-minimum effort, we 
as consumers rejected this ad as a perfor-
mative act, and, in place of those reposts, 
put out demands about what we would 
like to see changed within the culture 
and infrastructure of the company itself, 
there would be greater inspiration for 
reconstruction. 
Although it seems like a lot of tedious 
work, doing devout research on the 
companies you give your dollar to can 
not only inform you of the ways you are 
indirectly investing in oppressive institu-
tions, but can guide you to lesser known 
companies and brands who produce 
the same product more ethically. Here, 
what the consumer loses is convenience, 
which has been an apparently valuable 
asset to American consumption. So, for 
the people who have the financial means 
to challenge their everyday expenses and 
replace them with more ethical efforts, 
this should be done immediately and 
with perpetual consciousness, despite 
the subtle impact it has on one’s sched-

ule — because put simply, to pay a higher 
price or drive a little further for your 
desired product for the sake of human 
being’s lives everywhere should not be an 
inconvenience, but a blessing. However, 
many people who resort to these “easy 
fix” companies such as Amazon or CVS 
— because of their frequent locations and 
consistent prices — are those who cannot 
afford to instead support the Black bou-
tique or hardware store with challenging 
prices in comparison. This makes it so 
the people being the most oppressed are 
also often the most reliant on the institu-
tions and companies that oppress them. 
For those who have the means to invest 
in ethically mature companies instead, 
the responsibility is greatly on you. 
None of this is to say that consumer-
ism cannot be used productively and 
ethically. Consumerism can absolutely 
be used for the force of good, but not 
when it is done mindlessly to satisfy the 
capitalist cycle. With consumerism, 
comes rights of the consumer. Histori-
cally, consumerism pushed society away 
from the slave institution, lessening the 
need for individual fulfillment alongside 
the increase of global product accessibil-
ity. For enslaved people now free, con-
sumerism was a symbol of that liberation 
through which they could provide them-
selves with their own shelter, wardrobe 
and way of life. 
Similarly, in societies with a strictly 
established caste system, consumerism 
allows for the dispelling of clear barri-
ers between those casted communities. 
Civilians of considerably lower caste 
can assert themselves and their worth 
through what they buy and how they 
dress, instead of being forced into a cer-
tain profession or way of life. This all 
feeds into the notion that consumerism 
gives an individual immense power we 
often do not recognize. If we continue 
to ignore this power, we continue to 
feed the system oppressing us and our 
communities. If we hone in on this 
power, unite beneath it and urge com-
panies to revolutionize the way they 
satisfy the consumer with ethical prac-
tices, we take one step closer toward 
the revolution. We take one step closer 
to freedom for all. 
A revolution of our current social 
system, an economic revolution and 
even a personal revolution cannot occur 
without steady intention and planning. 
If the everyday consumer and civilian 
cannot first recognize the value of all of 
humanity, not just those like them, they 
will not feel a need to demand a change 
of system. If we are compassionate, we 
do our research, we understand where 
our products come from and who cre-
ates them, we have understanding. If 
we do all of this, and then stop feeding 
those companies who do not meet the 
criteria society demands of them, we 
have progress. 

N

ike — a brand comfortable 
affiliating itself with social jus-
tice movements — was among 
the first to post on social media platforms, 
which likely encouraged other compa-
nies to follow suit: Netflix tweeted, “To 
be silent is to be complicit. Black lives mat-
ter;” Disney tweeted, “We stand against 
racism. We stand for inclusion;” Ben & 
Jerry’s — also very comfortable with 
being political — tweeted, “4 years ago, in 
the wake of Ferguson, we felt compelled 
to support the #BlackLivesMatter move-
ment. We’re heartbroken those words are 
just as relevant today. These racist and bru-
tal attacks against our Black brothers and 
sisters must end.” However, many ask what 
tangible impact might come from these 
online posts and what quantitative support 
they’ll provide in the enduring fight against 
systemic racism and oppression. 
Publicly voicing support for the Black 
Lives Matter movement and pursuing 
anti-racist action is an acceptable first 
step, but allyship must extend far beyond 
online performativism or statements of 
solidarity. Cephas Williams, founder of 
56 Black Men, states, “Now is not the time 
to be silent, neither is it the time to jump 
on a bandwagon. It’s a time for real reflec-
tion and care with regards to how a brand 
and its leaders stand by the Black com-
munity at this time and move forward 
with real steps to end racism and injustice 
globally and not only on the streets but 
in their organizations too.” These verbal 
promises and public recitations need to 

translate into actual change within com-
panies and communities, the first step of 
which can be examining harmful envi-
ronments and systems. Taking care of 
employees who have been harmed from 
these structures, offering reparations and 
advocating for their financial, physical 
and mental well-being is the next step. 
Contemporary 
marketing 
theories 
implore brands to associate themselves 
with current topics and movements that 
people care about. This means creating 
space for themselves where individuals 
commonly congregate on social media 
platforms, keeping up with trends and 
engaging in societal chatter. Even in times 
of tragedy, where companies undoubt-
edly have larger influence and resources 
than civilians, brands post the same cap-
tions and images as the rest of the social 
media population, filling feeds with black 
squares or graphics now seen hundreds 
of thousands of times. This templated 
action among brands rushing to show 
where they stand, without enacting long-
term solutions or staying involved, cre-
ates uncertainty for consumers beyond a 
slightly greater recognition of a progres-
sive presence and a lingering sense of 
virtue. As consumers, we have a certain 
responsibility to wield our spending power 
for the greater good of society. This looks 
like spending our money with intention. 
The average individual does not prop-
erly understand — because it is designed 
this way — the magnitude of control that 
capitalism and consumerism have on our 

nation. This uncertainty consequently 
feeds capitalist power; when we are 
unaware, and therefore dismissive, of the 
impact of our dollars, they fail to benefit us 
and in many ways, they begin to oppress 
us. When the companies who rely on our 
dollars stop receiving them, it can inspire 
a great period of reflection, demand and 
readjustment in the way our economy, 
environment and society function. These 
companies build their success off of cater-
ing to the consumer, so when the con-
sumer remains complicit in a company’s 
participation in the use of prison or child 
labor, underpaying employees, donating 
to ethically-disturbed organizations or 
people, or involvement in other oppressive 
or dehumanizing systems, it is our respon-
sibility to not feed that company anymore. 
Similarly, if a company’s infrastructure 
is void of cultural, age-based, race and 
gender-based diversity, but benefits from 
these same people, it is our responsibility 
to not feed that company anymore. Clos-
ing the racial wealth gap demands creat-
ing and ensuring opportunities for Black 
individuals to enter and gain traction 
within industries that have been heav-
ily and disproportionately dominated by 
white people. However, if we — the con-
sumer — are not disturbed by the dis-
proportionately white environment, and 
we remain seemingly satisfied with the 
way the company functions, change will 
not occur. This has been proven to us. 
Slavery is a conversation often 
assumed to be spoken on with historical

W
ith the death of George Floyd on May 25 and the coinciding protests 
across the nation, came a rather desperate leap from companies to align 
themselves with the Black liberation movement. Sporting hashtags including 
#BlackLivesMatter and #JusticeForFloyd, many large brands or organizations 
responded to the collective unrest of the nation by posting messages of solidarity.

T

wo months into this year’s 
Black Lives Matter protests that 
call for the defunding of police 
departments across the country, Presi-
dent Donald Trump has yet to respond 
in a way that isn’t thoroughly racist and 
problematic. Outrage swept through the 
nation in response to the first reports of 
unidentified federal agents arriving in 
Portland, Ore., — a hotspot for Black Lives 
Matter protests — in unmarked vans, 
kidnapping citizens off the streets and 
placing them under arrest without prob-
able cause. In one case, Mark Pettibone, 
a 29-year-old protestor, fled after real-
izing he was being pursued by men in an 
unmarked vehicle wearing military-style 
outfits, believing it was a far-right extrem-
ist group. After realizing his efforts to 
escape were fruitless, he was detained, 

read his Miranda rights and promptly 
asked if he would waive those rights in 
order to be interrogated. He refused and 
was immediately released. They never 
directly told him the crimes he was 
accused of or who had detained him.
These officers aren’t simply arrest-
ing protestors without probable cause, 
either. After a United States Navy vet-
eran approached these federal officials 
in Portland to ask why they weren’t hon-
oring their oath to the Constitution, they 
beat him and sprayed him with chemical 
irritants, going so far as to break one of 
his hands. This is indisputable evidence 
that Trump is not only criminalizing 
protestors, in violation of their First 
Amendment rights, but is also encourag-
ing agents at the Department of Home-
land Security to violently attack anyone 

— even military veterans — for simply 
questioning them. Even some Republi-
cans and former directors of DHS are 
speaking out against Trump’s recent 
authoritarian actions — an unnerving 
sign that our country is falling victim to 
its fascist leader. 
Trump and many conservatives’ 
counterarguments to the fury over-
whelming the nation in response to these 
reports deny that these demonstrations 
should even be referred to as protests. 
Instead, they insist they are violence-
ridden riots led by anarchists and Antifa 
that cause excessive harm to people, 
government buildings and businesses in 
the city. However, while some protestors 
do identify themselves as Antifa, count-
less eyewitnesses have claimed the pro-
tests are largely peaceful and violence 

only erupts when incited by the police 
and federal agents invading the city. In 
fact, the deputy chief of police in Port-
land claimed his department has taken 
a hands-off approach to the protests 
because of their general peacefulness 
and stated he never requested federal 
assistance. Even more, the mayor of 
Portland has called for Trump to remove 
his troops from the city, after he himself 
got tear gassed by federal officers, assert-
ing that their actions have only “ratch-
eted up the tension on (their) streets.” It’s 
becoming apparent that Trump is active-
ly ignoring the reality of the protests and 
the objections from local government 
and police departments in order to focus 
his re-election platform on the revitaliza-
tion of the war against crime.
If the Trump administration con-
sidered historical patterns and advice 
from expert criminologists, they would 
understand this response is only going 
to incite violence. In 1965, President 

Lyndon B. Johnson passed the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Act, sparking 
an aggressive war on crime that was not 
a response to remarkable crime rates, 
but rather to the civil rights protests that 
began to escalate just a year before. In 
fact, rates of crime were lower in 1965 
than in 1933, and they more than tripled 
by 1995 after the act was passed. Just 
six years after Johnson’s declaration, in 
1971, President Richard Nixon declared 
the War on Drugs, criminalizing addic-
tion and giving law enforcement another 
excuse to target and incriminate Black 
people. Both of these “wars” dispro-
portionately targeted Black Americans, 
triggered their mass incarceration and 
contributed to the rapid growth of the 
prison-industrial complex. 

“

Okay, who thinks it’s funny 
to spray paint The Manny up 
there, huh?” user @/ jacob.jarvis 
mocked in his viral tik tok with a can 
of spray paint in his hand. This was 
among the first sightings of “Diary of a 
Wimpy Kid” character Manny Heffley 
being taken to the streets by Genera-
tion Z. Created by author Jeff Kinney, 
the protagonist Greg Heffley’s spoiled 
three-year-old brother Manny cries his 
way through his toddler-esque trou-
bles. He is portrayed as growing in his 
antagonism throughout the series, and 
is described by fans as “quite intelligent 
but is still socially awkward” — argu-
ably the perfect representation of our 
generation. User @/ themannyspotted 
took this idea a step further, accompa-
nying drawings of The Manny with 
his viral audio, “The Manny will not be 
televised. Look at how pissed off The 
Manny is — look how mad he is, he’s 
tired of police brutality!” 
The commentary takes a modern 
spin on Gill Scott-Heron’s radical 1971 
classic “The Revolution Will Not Be 
Televised.” Since then, street art of The 
Manny has been complemented with 
phrases like “ACAB” and “F*** 12” as a 
retaliation against police brutality and 
American imperialism. What started 
out as a joke quickly evolved into what 
many are calling an unlikely and per-
haps trivializing symbol for the Black 
Lives Matter movement. In response 
to the critics of the symbol, user @/
soupytime suggested The Manny is an 
unavoidable and glaring nod to “stop 
what you’re doing and sign a petition,” 
concluding that the end goal would 
be “to get Fox News to declare it [The 

Manny] officially a hate symbol used by 
the radical-left youth.” Despite the rath-
er calculating intentions of this user, 
instagram account @/tmwnbt created 
a carrd, a customizable platform for 
building easily accessible one-page sites 
for pretty much anything. The Manny 
site was ultimately used as a landing 
page for petitions and organizations. 
This is not the first time members 
of Gen Z have worked to disrupt what 
President Donald Trump declared as a 
“culture war” against the progressive 
left. After all, trolling to demand social 
justice is what we do best — from false-
ly overestimating the anticipated audi-
ence of President Trump’s re-election 
campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., by reg-
istering thousands of tickets to Tik Tok 
teens who had no intention of attend-
ing, to campaigning for The Manny 
flag and Wiz Khalifa’s “Black and Yel-
low” to take place of the current Amer-
ican flag and national anthem. The 
absurdity of these political pranks puts 
our generation under the same naive 
and cartoon-like lens as Manny Hef-
fley, but this perception is nothing new 
to Boomers like Michael Levin. The 
wrath of Generation Z further rein-
forces the so-called left-wing cultural 
revolution Trump accuses of seeking 
to wage a “merciless campaign to wipe 
out our history, defame our heroes, 
erase our values, and indoctrinate our 
children.” In terms, we are The Manny 
all grown up: pissed off enough to peel 
away from our self-absorption and 
youthful arrogance.
While the comedic origins of the 
meme are certainly questionable, and 
meme activism itself steps danger-

ously into an amalgamation of humor 
and serious politics, The Manny does 
act as a social commentary on genera-
tional conflict. Boomers and Zoomers 
ruthlessly deride the other for their 
way of life and their view on politics, 
overlooking the obvious generational 
disconnection in experiences. The 
trolling nature of The Manny and the 
sarcastic support to replace the Ameri-
can flag with The Manny flag subtly 
resembles every older conservative’s 
greatest dread: cancel culture. When 
this brutally unforgiving phenomenon 
rears its head in politics, it’s often care-
lessly dismissed as the left-wing’s lack 
of tolerance. 
In line with the stereotypically 
sardonic and nihilist nature of Gen-
eration Z, we are notoriously known 
for our dramatics in political correct-
ness and the online shaming of those 
who defy proper etiquette. While it’s 
true that this practice can be toxic at 
times and that well-intended memos 
are usually overwhelmed by frivo-
lous Twitter fights, the sentiments 
of this act are quite simple: Cancel 
culture expects accountability. It 
demands that tolerance not be the 
solution to differences of opinion 
— especially when the problematic 
voice is far more influential than the 
other. In a country where patriotism 
and loyalty are praised and expect-
ed, cancel culture seems like the 
anti-American hellion.

A

s a University of Michigan 
staff member, reading the 
WilmerHale report on Uni-
versity Provost Martin Philbert’s 
sexual misconduct is both sicken-
ing and validating. Staff who have 
experienced or witnessed sexual 
harassment at the University know 
how it goes. The Office for Institu-
tional Equity is brought in — or they 
aren’t — they botch an investigation 
or don’t conduct one at all and then 
you’ll face retaliation for daring to 
speak up. In some cases, you didn’t 
actually dare report, but unwittingly 
stumbled into someone’s reporting 
obligation and found your reputa-
tion destroyed anyway. Oh, there is a 
policy in the Standard Practice Guide 
against retaliation? Please tell that to 
the managers who retaliate readily, 
easily and with impunity.
Time and again, the report alludes 
to staff who experienced or got 
wind of harm but feared speaking 
out, feared professional retribution. 
I want to affirm that based on my 
many years working at the University, 
all those fears are completely valid. 
This place is incredibly hierarchical, 
and power is concentrated within 
leadership. Survivors and their sup-
porters get kicked off important proj-
ects, denied promotions or socially 
iced-out under the guise of not being 
“trusted” — that is, no longer seen 
as willing to trade their ethics for 
advancement. Some staff try with 
limited success to fight back against 
this dynamic; some try to bury the 
pain of their disenfranchisement 
and moral injury, often resulting in 

mental and physical health problems; 
some are chased out of their field. The 
Michigan brand and image takes pre-
cedence over safety and fairness, and 
in turn, over retaining diverse talent. 
You’d think the University would 
view all those things as important to 
its reputation, but stupidly, it doesn’t.
The report offers several recom-
mendations to improve campus cli-
mate. I hope the University takes 
them seriously. But none of the guid-
ance engages the point: Unchecked 
power and hierarchy in higher educa-
tion preserves sexism, racism and vio-
lence toward students and workers.
To that end, though I love my 
work, I’m job searching to get out of 
this place. I’ve been gaslit by super-
visors whose “feedback” amounts to 
backlash. I’m tired of watching my 
friends and colleagues get violated 
by male coworkers, then trauma-
tized by OIE and their leaders. This 
place doesn’t deserve us. I’m sorry 
to the brilliant students I won’t be 
able to serve, I’m sorry to my dedi-
cated colleagues who are still trying 
to make it work — there is indeed 
something to the idea of making 
change from within, if you can stand 
it — and I’m most sorry to survivors 
whom this University has failed. You 
always deserved a safe and fair work-
place. You still do. May we find it, 
and may brave people continue to tell 
the truth knowing that it just might 
set their future on fire.

It’s said that every theatre is inhabited by at 
least one ghost, and contrary to legends propa-
gated by Halloween, these ghosts do not like the 
dark. Thus, when the curtain falls and a theatre’s 
house empties, an employee will leave a light — a 
ghost light — to burn onstage until the perform-
ers return. Across the world, ghost lights have 
remained on and untouched for months. But the 
lives of performers continue offstage, each day 
adding pressure to find performance spaces on 
digital platforms. What happens when the ghost 
lights keep burning and we’re left with a stage 
wholly mediated by posts, shares, comments and 
likes?
Stella Abrera was supposed to retire from 
American Ballet Theater on June 13. The 
prima ballerina danced with ABT for 24 years 
— a quarter century with the country’s national 
company, scheduled to conclude on the week 
of her 42nd birthday. Had everything gone to 
plan, the show would have been met with a 
once-in-a-lifetime downpour of flowers on the 
Metropolitan Opera House stage. 
Instead, June 13 came and went fairly silent-
ly. Friends and company representatives post-
ed congratulatory photos of the ballerina on 
Instagram, but in reality Abrera had stopped 
dancing months before. Her final performance 
was a February rendition of “Giselle” at the 
Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., shortly 
before much of the United States abruptly shut 
down in response to COVID-19. She later told 
the New York Times that part of her was glad to 
avoid the pressure of a real final performance, 
but her predicament still feels disheartening — 
24 years of performances ended without punc-
tuation, without agency for the performer. As 
the shutdown of performing arts industries 
continues into the fall, Abrera’s situation is 
hardly singular. Three artists at the Alvin Ailey 
American Dance Theater also faced cancelled 
retirement shows in June and the list will be 

sure to grow as the ghost lights remain lit. 
Nevertheless, Abrera’s unusually quiet 
conclusion does not make her future any less 
loud — she is now the leading force behind the 
first reappearance of live performance in the 
United States. After retirement, she assumed 
the role of Artistic Director of the Kaatsbaan 
Cultural Park in Tivoli, N.Y., where she and 
her small team of six have planned the event 
space’s first ever dance festival. Starting last 
Saturday and continuing through the end of 
this month, dancers will perform short and 
socially distanced new works of choreography 
on an outdoor stage built especially for this 
summer. Small audiences will sit six feet apart 
or watch from cars and set lists will be kept 
short to avoid the need for bathroom breaks. 
Dystopian conditions aside, the festival has 
been celebrated as a refreshing splash of cold 
water in a world that continually feels as if it’s 
on fire — live performance and new choreogra-
phy backdropped by rejuvenating expanses of 
natural beauty. Summer months in the dance 
world are typically synonymous with festivals. 
Jacob’s Pillow in Massachusetts, Vail in Colo-
rado and the American Dance Festival in North 
Carolina typically attract international swaths 
of performers and audiences every year. They 
are now all operating online, citing the dangers 
posed by long flights and large audiences dur-
ing a pandemic. 
The Kaatsbaan space, though three decades 
old, has never hosted a festival. A recent NYT 
article stressed this detail’s importance: Abrera 
“has no precedent to live up to,” meaning she is 
free to keep things small. The local audiences 
and bare-bones sets are thus not sad downsizes 
but rather exciting opportunities. These points 
are indeed liberating in the consideration of 
logistics, but there also seem to be deeper 
advantages to Kaatsbaan’s empty blueprints.

It takes only a page or two of reading 
to realize that the cover of “Milkman” is 
deceptive. The binding of the 2018 win-
ner of the Man Booker Prize depicts an 
innocuous, fluorescent-pink sunset — 
one of those once a year, stop-and-snap-
a-photo sunsets that makes “Milkman” 
stands out among its fellow books.
The sedative lightness of the cover 
seems to admit innocuousness. But 
“Milkman” is not innocuous. Nor is it 
gentle, or quiet, or apologetic — nothing 
that the cover may suggest about a sub-
dued, romantic narrative. To say I wasn’t 
excited to read the Booker winner would 
be a lie — based on the superficiality of 
covers and excerpts, I have rooted for 
“Milkman” since its nomination on the 
long-list — but the way I fell in love with 
reading “Milkman” was not in the pleas-
ant, blushing manner I had expected. It 
was a cycle of shock, recoil and return.
Anna Burns’s third novel narrates the 
story of an 18-year-old girl (referred to 
as “Middle Sister,” as none of the charac-
ters in “Milkman” are prescribed actual 
names) over the course of two months. 
Her unnamed town is saturated with vio-
lence — violence from the ubiquitously 
demonized enemy countries “over the 
water,” violence from the renouncers 
of the state that control Middle Sister’s 
town and violence from the state police 
as they intervene in a village of scattered 
revolutionaries. 
Surprisingly, 
though, 
this war-zone setting is but an offhand 
normality in the book. Instead, it is Milk-
man, a paramilitary that begins making 
unwarranted advances on middle sister, 
that takes the place of chief antagonist 
in the book.
At first glance, Burns lays out an invid-
ious landscape that seems to hyperbolize 
the dark experience of growing up as a 
woman in the late 20th century. Maybe, 
Burns seems to suggest, the descent of 
society would look like this for all gen-
ders. But on second thought, the land-
scape Middle Sister walks — and how 
her 
hyperaware, 
rightfully-paranoid 
thoughts congeal in it — becomes pain-
fully real. Middle Sister’s encounters 
with Milkman while walking, her fears 
of being drugged, the pernicious com-
ments coming from third brother-in-law, 
all resonate uncomfortably with the real-
ties meeting women today.
This daring, critical kick at that expe-
rience of being a woman pays off. The 
apotheosis of the book’s dark and appli-
cable portrayals is perhaps Tablets Girl, 

a “girl who was actually a woman,” that 
is one of the local outcasts in Middle 
Sister’s town due to her propensity to 
poison people. This usually takes place, 
most suitably and without retribution, 
in bars. People flee from Tablets Girl, 
people watch their drinks when Tablets 
Girl is around. It’s not just Burns’s clear 
allusion to date-rape that that is to be 
appreciated here, but her spiked humor 
and exaggeration also.
This is not to reduce “Milkman” down 
to a forced, constricted focus on gender-
politics though. Burns’s writing alone is 
remarkable (something I refuse to say 
passively). “Milkman” is brimming with 
endlessly long paragraphs, lose-your-
train-of-thought stretched sentences and 
digressing thoughts from Middle Sister 
that render the book incredibly complex. 
At first, I was perturbed by this formal 
and royal-esque writing, especially upon 
an encounter with a paragraph spanning 
four, almost five, pages. But as I contin-
ued, I found myself — in an unlikely way 
— reading Middle Sister’s voice in an 
uninterrupted pattern even more critical 
and translucent than I expected possible. 
This is assisted by Burns’s near-perfect 
draw of synonyms through the book, 
making her writing appear dependably 
careful and personal.
I was enamored by the characters in 
“Milkman” and the abrasive humor that 
was tacked onto them. It isn’t often that 
I get a full cast of characters (narrator, 
antagonist, family) that are so real, so 
exciting to encounter. Most memorable 
are the “wee sisters,” Middle Sister’s 
three younger sisters who, despite their 
young ages, are infatuated with topics 
such as French revolutionaries, going 
through “Kafka phases” and eavesdrop-
ping every moment they get. Characters 
like the wee sisters offer unexpected 
gratification along Burns’s dark time-
line of events. The real humor displayed 
make “Milkman” all the more authentic 
and pleasurable.
I love “Milkman” because it is a fruit-
ful attempt to offer me hints of a human 
experience I will never be able to under-
stand, let alone be familiar with. Perhaps 
the most evocative and vivid account in 
the vein of social-rebellion and unwant-
ed-gaze I have ever encountered, “Milk-
man” is a narrative that has been told 
repeatedly, even frequently in the 21st 
century. Burns’s unequivocal writing 
turns this narrative into a fearsome 
chant, one well worth shouting along to.

BOOK REVIEW
BOOK REVIEW


Let it be known that Hozier, Irish singer-song-
writer extraordinaire, receives poetry books as 
Christmas gifts. Yes, The man behind our favorite 
sleepy Sunday morning tunes with his poignant, 
dreamy voice reads poetry. And, most importantly: 
If you tune in to Instagram Live at the right time 
on Fridays, Hozier will read a selection of poetry 
to you. For the past four weeks, Hozier presented 
a kinder, gentler side of the internet. His perfor-
mance of casual loungewear and literary greats 
found purchase with casual and ardent listeners 
alike. He will repeatedly and endearingly fumble 
through poetry books to find a specific poem.
With his hair combed back into a messy yet 
practical bun, Hozier faces away from his record-
ing phone while reading. He looks clean, calm and 
human. Mundane. He speaks informally to fans 
and casual listeners, quickly mentioning the name 
and author of his chosen poems before diving into 
some great works. He keeps his voice steady and 
calls Yeats “sassy” before moving on to another 
poet. 
Homey and comfortable, Hozier slows down 
and invites others to pause their lives to appreciate 
the quiet and subtle beauty of good writing.
The relentless self-promotion native to Insta-
gram Live streams is notably absent. Hozier has 
yet to descend on a long, self-seeking monologue 
of his COVID-19 grievances. In a surprising but 
not unwelcome change, he simply reads poetry, 
no insensitive commentary or unskippable adverts 
attached. There’s no hyperactive positivity. There’s 
no accompanying band or microphone. Instead, 
what you have is what you hear. Hozier, unassum-
ing, kindly reminding listeners to wash their hands 
and stay safe while sharing his interests.
His voice doesn’t pretend that the world outside 
makes sense. His slow cadence acknowledges the 
challenges of the present yet remains soothing. 

There’s a startling lack of artifice. Hozier dips his 
head while reading, focused on shaping the words. 
He is reminiscent of a graduate student instructor, 
overworked and bibliophilic.
However, Hozier’s Friday poetry corner read-
ings, while humble and calming, still serve as 
performance: a new kind of performance, long

Hozier films seated comfortably in front of a 
large window showing off gorgeous spriggy trees. 
Nature functions as the backdrop to his relaxed 
intimacy. It’s fitting that Hozier frames his poetry 
readings with nature. His fans famously manipu-
late his music, overlaying nature sounds with his 
recordings to draw out the serene core of Hozier’s 
discography. 
Hozier takes his time reading, broadcasting an 
ideal calm. For a short moment, his quiet, sooth-

These intimate performances epitomize the 
kind of relaxed introspection we desperately crave 
in our busy work day. Hozier’s poetry corners tell 
us that Hozier is but a man who enjoys the finer 
things in life: poetry, heather mock necks and W

appreciation.
Hozier doesn’t ask questions about the wild 
stress and fear a man refusing to wear a mask in the 
grocery store inspires. He doesn’t reprimand you 
for your tired typos and rushed Zoom meetings. 
Hozier performs a fantasy, one hallmarked by cozy 
pull-overs and a natural background. The events

premise of poetry reading compels. Hozier draws

“Memories are unreliable . . . Art is memo-
ry made public,” a musician muses in David 
Mitchell’s new novel, “Utopia Avenue.” 
Mitchell taps into an enduring public mem-
ory for the book: the late ’60s. It chronicles the 
rise of a fictional British band called Utopia 
Avenue, in the era of flower power and free 
love. The band’s members come from dispa-
rate areas of the Soho music scene: There’s 
Elf, a folkstress fresh from a “Sonny and Cher” 
type duo with an ex-boyfriend; Dean, a bassist 
struggling for cash; Griff, a jazz drummer; and 
Jasper, a Dutch guitar prodigy. A uniquely egal-
itarian band, they split the singing, songwrit-
ing, instrumental duties and royalties equally.
Utopia Avenue’s music is described as “a shot 
of R&B with a glug of psychedelica” and “a dash 
of folk.” Another character calls them a “cut of 
Pink Floyd … a dash of Cream, (and) a pinch of 
Dusty Springfield.” Personally, they sounded 
like David Bowie’s self-titled 1969 classic or 
The Velvet Underground’s 1970 “Loaded.” 
Mitchell gives the reader scant information 
about the music itself, just enough to propel 
one’s imagination and orient the music in its 
cultural context, preferring instead to focus 
on the inspirations behind the fictional songs 
through narrative. 
The story follows the band’s formation and 
rise to stardom, and is broken into three parts, 
corresponding with Utopia Avenue’s three LPs. 
Each POV segment matches one of the band’s 
songs, and frequently reveals the inspira-
tions behind the music. The plot, turning like 
a record, meanders and doubles back on itself 
as certain scenes crop up again in different 
chapters like leitmotifs varying from charac-
ter to character. This never becomes tiresome, 
because Mitchell’s prose is, as ever, immacu-
late. 
His characters and settings are as lush and 
finely crafted as Rembrandt paintings. The 
paragraphs flow seamlessly, simultaneously 
delicious with detail but addictively readable. 
The amount of detail is just right, enough to be 
immersive but not so much that one loses the 
empathetic tether with the finely drawn char-
acters. Mitchell also takes enjoyable pitstops 
where cultural icons pop up for cameos, like 
heroes in a Marvel film. While the surprise is 
half the fun of it, a pre-fame David Bowie steals 
every scene he’s in.
The novel is no simple nostalgia-fest, 
though. It hones in on the ’60s with a modern 
lens, exploring gender, sexuality, mental ill-
ness, prejudice and poverty along with rock 
’n’ roll. While there’s the usual beats of the late 
’60s, the rock music, protests and drugs, Mitch-
ell also highlights what fiction usually shies 
away from when covering the period. Figures 

in positions of power, such as industry boss-
es, record store owners or family patriarchs, 
exhibit anti-semitism, racism, sexism and 
homophobia, illustrating what made the era 
a difficult time to live in if one wasn’t a white 
male. It is refreshing to dig beneath the flowery 
veneer with characters who do not fit the era’s 
stereotypes. Elf and Utopia Avenue’s manager 
Leon benefit the most from this multifaceted 
treatment, and their experiences being homo-
sexual in an intolerent era are the most poi-
gnant of the book. Elf also contends with being 
a woman in a male-dominated industry, and is 
frequently sexualized, patronized or flat out 
ignored, even by her own band members. 
Additionally, Mitchell explores art’s relation 
to society in a fascinating, and prescient, man-
ner. 
“We, my friends, are the bottlesmashers,” 
a famous rocker says. “We release the genies . 
. . In the ears of the young the genies whisper 
what was unsayable. ‘Hey, kids- there’s noth-
ing wrong with being gay.’ Or ‘What if war isn’t 
a patriotism test, but really fucking dumb?’ 
Or ‘Why do so few own so goddamn much?’. 
. . Those whispers are the blueprints of the 
future.”
“Utopia Avenue” is a comforting escape 
from troubled times and a reminder that prog-
ress is never far from the horizon, especially 
when art continues to break boundaries. Yet 
while Mitchell conjures concert halls across 
the globe, filled to the brim with roaring fans, 
underground gay bars in London where artists 
mingle over fancy cocktails and the scrubby, 
sun-bleached Laurel Canyon with flair, the plot 
buckles under an unnecessary cosmic weight. 
Known as the “Mitchellverse,” David Mitch-
ell’s oeuvre shares characters and a fantastical 
system of reincarnation, with dueling sects of 
immortal souls. While this benefits “Utopia” in 
some respects, like when a fan-favorite “Cloud 
Atlas” character reappears, it mostly reads as 
indulgent at best, and problematic at worst. 
Mitchell makes lengthy digressions to 
heroes and villains from his last two novels 
“The Bone Clocks” and “Slade House.” While 
those books worked as cosmic epics, the fan-
tasy, coming out of left field here, will confuse 
those unfamiliar with Mitchell’s earlier work. 
“Utopia” is a character-centered meander 
through psychedelic rock, not a centuries-
spanning, sci-fi epic like his other books. 
When a lengthy sojourn is made to immortal 
souls dueling another immortal soul, it reads 
as tacked on. One just wants to get back to the 
rock band. Additionally, his previous books 
take great pains to respectfully portray a 
diverse cast of immortal characters. “Utopia,” 
however, lacks this context.

Cracking open the coconut: 
the reality of being a ‘white 
washed Indian’

“Are you even Indian?”
“You’re so light-skinned, you must be 
half.”
“Why do you listen to so much white 
music?”
“He’s a coconut (brown on the outside, 
white on the inside).”
“She’s barely brown, have you seen who 
she hangs out with?”
To be honest, I’ve said some of these 
things before, and I’ve been on the receiv-
ing end of them. But I have no clue what they 
even mean. Lately, I’ve been stuck on one 
thought: What is a “whitewashed Indian?”
It doesn’t exist. 
The term “white” refers to people of cul-
tures across Europe, particularly Western 
Europe. Someone who is white could have 
ancestry coming from Italy, Greece, Poland, 
Switzerland, France, Germany, etc. Today, 
white people live across much of the globe 
and make up the majority of the population 
of America. While their ancestry can often 
be traced back to Europe, this global resi-
dence can be considered a result of imperial-
ism and migration patterns. 
Being white in America often refers to 
someone’s fair complexion, and the term 
“whitewashing” often refers to the erasure 
of culture using whiteness. An example of 
this can be seen in Hollywood when a char-
acter of color is portrayed by a white actor, 
such as when Matt Damon was cast to play 
the role of a Chinese soldier in the film, “The 
Great Wall.” However, in the context of a 
saying someone is white washed, the term is 
applied to people to claim they have stripped 
themselves of their color and adopted “white 
culture.” But there is no standard of how 
cultured you can be to qualify as a person of 
color. 
Furthermore, the term “whitewashed

The “5 Love Languages,” pioneered by 
Gary Chapman in the 1992 book, are coined 
as the five primary ways to express and 
receive love with those in your life. They 
include words of affirmation, receiving gifts, 
quality time, physical touch and acts of ser-
vice. By correctly identifying your love lan-
guage, and the love language of those around 
you, you may be able to improve relation-
ships by showing people appreciation and 
care in the way they best receive it. Although 
the love languages are mainly used amongst 
romantic partners, I find they encapsulate 
major parts of any loving relationship includ-
ing platonic connections with friends and 
family. 
What intrigues me is what might happen 
to a relationship when certain circumstances 
make these five languages inaccessible. I’ve 
grown up speaking English and can under-
stand, but speak very little of my native 
language Malayalam. My grandparents 
are the opposite: They speak fluent Malay-
alam and just enough English to somewhat 
slice through my accent, understand and 
put out an unstable response. Quality time 
and physical touch are sparse and forced 
when pushed into a quick two-week visit 
every other year. Receiving gifts—although 
it means little to me as is—doesn’t happen 
when you don’t spend birthdays, holidays or 
anniversaries together. Words of affirma-
tion become difficult when the two parties 
can just barely understand basic dialogue 
between one another.
The relationship between my grandpar-
ents and myself has been atypical compared 
to most of the grandparent-grandchild rela-
tionships I’ve seen growing up. I was raised 
in the U.S. and they lived in India for most 
of my adolescent years; my father’s parents 
(Achacha and Achamma) immigrated back 
to the U.S. very recently — because of their 
old age and growing need for care — and 
have been living with my family or my cous-

ins at different points of the year they have 
been here. As the two of them have spent 
time at home with us during quarantine, I’ve 
reflected on the relationship I’ve curated 
with them and how it compares to the ones I 
would see growing up on television, at school 
events and at friends’ houses — oftentimes 
sugar coated, sweet and supportive. Cultural 
barriers and physical barriers have made 
this connection hard for me to find with my 
grandparents. Yet, the language barrier is 
the hardest part.
Communication with both sets of my 
grandparents is endearingly broken. It usu-
ally functions with simple dialogue — one 
party speaks slowly in their primary lan-
guage, one of my parents mediates as a 
translator (which has become increasingly 
important as my grandparents’ hearing has 
worsened over the years) and the other party 
replies a short response to keep it simple. 
Frankly, it’s hard for me to develop a real, 
meaningful connection with someone when 
I can’t openly converse with them or get to 
know their lives, experiences, deep thoughts 
and ideas — the list goes on and on. Why? 
Maybe because for me, words of affirma-
tion (and generally, communication through 
conversation) is my primary love language. 
Thus, the language barrier has made my per-
ception of our connection blurry. Yet, after 
looking more broadly at the love languages, 
I’ve found the less obvious forms of commu-
nication between my grandparents and me; 
the love doesn’t dwindle because our verbal 
conversations are strained. It presents itself 
in different forms. 
Take acts of service, for example. There’s 
a vivid memory I have from around age six 
when my dad’s parents had been visiting 
from India for a few months over my summer 
vacation. During the day, their schedules 
remained pretty constant: make breakfast, 
read prayers, watch Malayalam soap operas 
and cook.

Indian,” doesn’t make sense, since there 
is no one culture associated with the term 
“white.” So when someone refers to you as a 
“whitewashed Indian,” are they saying you 
are immersed in Italian culture? Greek cul-
ture? Maybe you could say that they’re refer-
ring to American culture, but the last time I 
checked, the term “American” does not equal 
“white.” 
Let’s say they are referring to American 
culture. “Hey Prisha, you, an American who 
is of Indian descent and a first-generation 
immigrant, are so immersed in American 
culture.” To be honest, I’ve called my friends 
whitewashed before, never realizing the 
implications of it. To my friends, I apologize, 
there is no shame in being immersed in the 
culture of the country you live in. 
Who are we to judge how someone else 
chooses to interact with the culture of their 
family? What are the qualifications of being 
“cultured” or “whitewashed?” If you speak 
your native language, but haven’t kept up 
with pop culture and Bollywood, what do 
you qualify as? If you eat daal roti sabzi for 
dinner every night, but can’t handle some 
spicy sambar, what do you qualify as? If you 
prefer the Jonas Brothers and One Direction 
over A.R. Rehman and Shreya Goshal, what 
do you qualify as? 
When you are a first or second-genera-
tion immigrant, there is no standard level 
of information and culture you ingrain from 
your country of origin. There is no check-
list to follow that quantifies what percent-
age of the culture you practice. You simply 
learn from what your family does and from 
what communities you live in. You develop 
your own culture based on your childhood 
experiences and use it to guide your life. And 
whether your personal culture is derived 
mostly from Indian or American...

A satiric preview for Netflix’s ‘Indian Matchmaking’

Heard the ruckus for the new 
Netflix reality TV show “Indian 
Matchmaking,” but not sure if you 
want to watch it? Don’t fret the 
details, I won’t spoil anything, but 
I’ll help you navigate whether or 
not this is a show for you. 
If you come from a Desi family 
like me, you grew up hearing about 
how the numerous relationships 
in your family were based upon 
an arranged marriage. While it is 
not as commonly practiced today, 
arranged marriages are super 
common within Southeast Asian 
households, as well as most Central 
Asian countries and the Middle 
East. That’s why when I saw the 
commotion around Netflix having 
a show focused on the South Asian 
community, I couldn’t wait to see

Lebanon: where suffering meets resilience

Yesterday, the world finally saw 
Lebanon through the eyes of its 
people: in pain and struggling. In 
the past year alone, Lebanon has 
experienced social/political upris-
ings, an economic crisis, extreme 
poverty and the repercussions of 
decades of political corruption. It 
took a colossal explosion of ammo-
nium nitrate at Lebanon’s main 
port in Beirut for the media to 
cover Lebanon’s struggles and for 
the world to acknowledge decades

of wars, corruption and outside 
interference the Lebanese people 
have endured. So far, 135 people 
have died, 5,000 people are injured, 
at least 300,000 people have been 
displaced from their homes, many 
are still searching for missing fam-
ily members and four hospitals in 
Beirut are too damaged to admit 
patients, leaving the Lebanese and 
its diaspora broken by yet another 
tragedy. The most devastating part 
of the explosion is that Lebanon is 
yet to bear the brunt of it. 
Prior to the explosion, Lebanon

modern take. While the show is 
based between both India and the 
United States, the relationships are 
inherently driven by regressive ide-
als of colorism, classism and gender 
stereotypes. 
Sima Aunty, the rishta queen of 
Mumbai, pulls biodata to form the 
most compatible pairs, in which 
contains information about the sin-
gle men and women seeking to get 
paired based on age, height, edu-
cation, career and more. Needless 
to say, the show is extremely toxic 
but insightful on a harsh reality for 
many within Desi culture. 
A fun game Sima Aunty sub-
consciously plays is find-the-back-
handed-compliment. If the man or 
woman does not fit the idealistic 
norm of being rich, fair, petite or 
beautiful enough, don’t worry! This 
rishta aunty might say their per-
sonality makes up for what’s lack-
ing. And if the lad or laddie has the 
“better rated” for looks, education 

and stability, they’ll get the upper 
hand in Sima Aunty finding them 
more suitable matches. If you’re 
the bottom end of the pair — and to 
make her job easier — she’ll recom-
mend how you’ll have to compro-
mise on personal desires in a future 
spouse in order to make the mar-
riage work. 
Depending on the focus, be it 
the man or woman, the narrative 
changes but the superficiality is 
maintained. For all the girl bosses 
— independent and running their 
lives — Aunty suggests it will be 
harder to match them because they 
have a mind of their own and the 
financial mobility to do so, inconve-
niencing Sima’s search. Similarly, if 
a client was previously divorced or 
is not the ideal body weight, you’ve 
gotta give Sima more time because 
you’re burdening her with unders-
ible characteristics. 
Meanwhile, the men on the show 
are in an entirely other ballgame.

While you get the occasional sweet 
laddu padhus who will charm the 
audience with their wholesome 
charisma, Sima prefers they have 
stable careers and six-figure jobs. 
The best part about being a male on 
her show is the richer you are the 
more choices you get. These men 

get hundreds of biodatas to choose 
from because objectifying women 
is so much fun! And who’s to blame 
them? They, or rather the parents, 
have to make sure their son’s wife 
is beautiful and fair enough...

try with several massive crises 
unfolding at once, with near-zero 
public trust in government entities 
to come to the rescue. For years, 
the fate of the Lebanese people has 
been at the hands of the corrupt 
sectarian government officials who 
prioritized their own greed over 
the people of Lebanon, leaving the 
country without a stable economy, 
stable electricity, waste manage-
ment services and food security.
In October 2019, a demonstra-
tion of protests erupted, demanding 
much needed political and social 
reform. The toppling of Lebanon’s 
broken economic system contin-
ues to fuel the Lebanese “thawra” 
(revolution). The Lebanese curren-
cy crashing, making it practically 
worth nothing, and skyrocketing 
prices of basic necessities, coupled 
with the effects of COVID-19 has 
left over 45 percent of Lebanon’s 
population living below the pov-
erty line and 49 percent food inse-
cure. Lebanon’s economy relies 
heavily on imports and now, during 
Lebanon’s worst economic crisis, a 
crater bigger than a football field 
now sits on what was Lebanon’s 
largest port. 
Without electricity, the Leba-
nese people were faced with the 
daunting task of searching for their 
loved ones during the dark of night 
with only voices and flashlights to 
guide them. Medical professionals 

were forced to use phone flash-
lights when treating patients and 
hospitals pleaded to turn the lights 
on. The pandemic has worsened

Big Ten releases testing procedures and protocol for fall sports

As many student-athletes and 
parents are criticizing the lack of 
standardized testing procedures 
in the NCAA, the Big Ten on 
Wednesday announced its own 
testing standards for its schools 
to follow.
Student-athletes 
must 
be 
tested at least once a week using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
testing, and will be processed 
by a third party laboratory that 
all Big Ten institutions will use. 
Sports that involve high levels 
of contact will be tested at least 
twice a week and testing will 
begin once competition begins.
“Today’s 
announcement,” 
chair of Big Ten Council of 
Presidents 
Morton 
Schapiro 
said in a press release, “though 
subject 
to 
local, 
state 
and 
federal public health guidelines, 
provides a path forward for 
Big 
Ten 
student-athletes 
to 

return to competition based on 
comprehensive, conference-wide 
medical policies and protocols 
established by the Big Ten Task 
Force for Emerging Infectious 
Diseases and the Big Ten Sports 
Medicine Committee. 
“We will continue to evaluate 
the best available information 
and advice from public health 
officials as we make decisions 
and necessary adjustments going 
forward.”
Participation in fall sports 
will 
remain 
optional, 
and 
student-athletes who choose not 
to participate will keep their 
scholarships for the year and 
“remain in good standing with 
the team.” While the Big Ten 
announced its football schedule 
on Wednesday, it hasn’t done 
the same for the remaining fall 
sports, stating that the situation 
is fluid and those sports will 
be postponed until at least 
September 5.
Fluidity is the theme in all 

collegiate athletics’ return to 
campus: Despite successful early 
returns of student-athletes to 
campus, institutions across the 
country 
(including 
Michigan) 
have canceled some voluntary 
workouts because of positive 
COVID-19 tests. 
The guidelines released today 
are a bare minimum for schools 
hoping to play, and certain 
colleges may put in place stricter 
policies 
for 
student-athletes. 
Additionally, as contact-tracing, 
other safety protocols or data 
trends come into play, the Big 
Ten is emphasizing flexibility in 
its policies.
“With the knowledge we have 
today, providing potential options 
for all of our student-athletes 
was of the utmost importance to 
us, all while ensuring there is a 
process in place to incorporate 
student-athlete feedback,” Big 
Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren 
said in the release.
“While a comprehensive plan 

has been developed, we also 
know it is essential to continue to 
be agile as new information and 
health trends become available 
and we will adjust accordingly.”

Michigan 
classes 
start 
on 
Aug. 31, and the true extent of 
the disease’s impact on college 
athletics will only be known once 
students return to campus.

Michigan’s conference-only schedule announced Wednesday

This year, the Wolverines won’t 
lose their ninth-straight game 
to Ohio State over Thanksgiving 
weekend. 
In The Big Ten’s release of 
its 
conference-only, 
10-game 
schedule, 
Michigan’s 
annual 
matchup against the Buckeyes 

is set to take place on Oct. 24 in 
Columbus. The move up follows 
the conference’s approach to the 
season: the earlier the better.
The season is intended to kick 
off on Sep. 5, where the Wolverines 
will take on Purdue at home, and 
finish on Nov. 21 for all teams in 
order to coordinate with schools’ 
schedules sending students home 
at Thanksgiving. The only game 

after the holiday will be the Big 
Ten championship, with that only 
involving two teams.
Beyond a date change, for the 
second year in a row, Michigan 
will play Michigan State in Ann 
Arbor. Without fans, playing at 
The Big House rather than Spartan 
Stadium packs less of a punch than 
it would in a normal year, but either 
way the Wolverines will not have to 

travel for their Oct. 3 faceoff.
The one Big Ten team that 
Michigan is slated to play that was 
not previously on its schedule is 
Northwestern. The game against 
the Wildcats takes place on Nov. 21 
and is its final game of the season.
In order to begin on the season on 
the scheduled date, the conference 
is allowing teams to start practices 
this Friday, Aug. 7.
Still, 
the 
conference 
has 
expressed that flexibility is key.
“The 10 games would be played 
over at least 12 weeks with each 
team having two open dates,” The 
Big Ten said in its Wednesday 
morning release. “... Games can be 
collapsed into bye weeks. … (and 
the) Schedule (is) constructed in 
a way that allows season to start 
as early as the weekend of Sept. 
5, but also provides the ability to 
move the start of the season back to 
Sept. 12, 19 or 26 through strategic 
sequencing that allows games to 
be moved to a latter part of the 
schedule.”
Michigan’s bye is in week six, the 
week of Oct. 11, and is sandwiched 
between Michigan State and at 
Indiana. All teams have a uniform 
bye the week of Nov. 28, following 

the scheduled last game of the 
season. 
Still, 
despite 
built-in 
flexibility, the conference isn’t one-
hundred percent sure their plan is 
failsafe.
“If the virus continues to spread 
among our students despite our 
many 
preventative 
measures, 
including testing and quarantine 
protocols,” The Big Ten statement 
said, “we are also prepared to
delay or cancel competition 
pursuant 
to 
local 
and 
state 
public 
health 
orders 
or 
the 
recommendations of our medical 
experts.”
So 
despite 
now 
having 
a 
schedule, as everyone should know 
by this point in the year, it all could 
change at any moment.

Michigan’s 2020 schedule:
Sep. 5 vs. Purdue 
Sep. 12 @ Minnesota
Sep. 19 vs. Penn State
Sep. 26 @ Rutgers
Oct. 3 vs Michigan State

From the rink to the Lake, Michigan defender Cam 
York’s passion goes far beyond just playing hockey

Cam York is the picture of 
confidence with a hockey stick in 
his hand. It’s a quiet confidence, 
but it oozes from every move he 
makes. 
When he’s not on the ice as 
a Michigan defenseman, York 
swaps out his stick for a fishing 
pole, an Xbox controller or a 
basketball — and not one ounce of 
his swagger diminishes.
“I’m a pretty good Fornite 
player,” York laughed. “ … Garrett 
Van Wyhe, Jake Gingell, Keaton 
Pearson, (they) all love it. When 
we have free time we’ll play 
together. Play some squads, get 
some dubs.”
Outside of video games, he 

spends time at the IM building 
shooting hoops. York’s biggest 
competition on the court — 
according to him — was Jack 
Olmstead, who transferred in 
April.
While he’s talented at gaming 
and basketball, fishing is York’s 
biggest off-ice passion. Here, his 
biggest competition is former 
teammate 
Hayden 
Lavigne. 
Captain Will Lockwood named 
Lavigne the most “mature” fisher 
on the team.
“From 
what 
I’ve 
heard, 
(Lavigne) 
knows 
what 
he’s 
doing,” York said. “I’d like to see 
him out on the West Coast and 
see what he can do first, though.”
One part of fishing York is eager 
to geek out about is knots. He 
boasts about the different knots 
he can tie and calls it his secret 

talent. The most impressive in his 
arsenal? The cinch knot. 
He explains the tying process 
like it’s the simplest thing in the 
world:
“It connects a braided line to 
a fluorocarbon line. That one’s 
really difficult, took me like a few 
weeks to perfect it but yeah, if 
you ask some random fisherman 
they probably can’t do it.”
York’s not selective with where 
he’ll cast his line or what he’ll 
fish for. And most of what he 
catches, he’ll eat. He’s watched 
his dad clean fish enough times 
to know how to do it.
At 
boarding 
school 
in 
Minnesota he’d fish for walleye 
in the lakes nearby. In Utah he’d 
fish for trout. On the California 
coast there’s tuna, striped bass 
and a plethora of other species. 
He once caught a 100 pound 
Mako shark in the ocean.
And that’s part of the reason 
why, if given the choice, York 
prefers saltwater to freshwater 
fishing. He never knows what 
he’s going to catch — or how big 
it’ll be. 
But 
there’s 
one 
question 
that trips York up: He doesn’t 
remember the exact details of 
the first fish he caught. When it’s 
brought up, all that confidence 
disappears and his answer is 
hesitant.
“I don’t know,” York said. “I 
think I do, but I don’t want to be 
wrong.” 
After reassurance that there’s 
really no way to fact check his 
answer, he took a guess. 
His grandpa had a pond in the 
backyard that was stocked with 
rainbow trout, and when York 
was little he remembers catching 
those. But to have 100 percent 
certainty, he says he’d have to 
consult his parents.
Growing up on the West 
Coast had a big influence on 
York’s passion for fishing. The 
family owned a boat and a young 
York and his dad would fish the 
open ocean. While the vessel 
is officially unnamed, York has 
some ideas in mind.
“I’d probably go with Five for 
Fighting,” York said. “I always 
had that in engraved in my head 
but could never actually put it 
on the boat. It’d keep it hockey 
related too.”

With hockey being such a 
demanding sport, fishing has 
always offered him an escape. 
It was a chance to connect with 
nature; a moment away from the 
ice, a break from his thoughts. 
An added bonus is the lack of cell 
service. It’s total isolation — just 
him, the water and whoever he’s 
with. 
Fishing has always played a 
big role in York’s relationship 
with his dad. For as long as he 
can remember, they’ve gone out 
on the water together. And, while 
he was still living in California, 
every year on his birthday he’d 
get to skip school to go fishing. 
Prior to this year, it’d been 
four years since York had been 
at home to celebrate a birthday, 
so any chance to be out on the 
boat with his dad is special and 
coveted.
Like this past summer, which 

the two spent out on the ocean 
catching 
tuna 
and 
dorado 
together.
As for fishing experiences he’s 
yet to cross off the bucket list, 
York dreams of going to Pedros 
Island in Baja California. 
“There’s just a ton of variety 
of fish around there,” York said. 
“And being in California, being 
kind of close, I’ve always wanted 
to go there. I always watch 
YouTube videos and TV shows 
about it.”
He’s also interested in trying 
noodling — catching catfish with 
bare hands. As of March, York 
has yet to go fishing with any of 
his teammates. It’s something 
he’s been looking forward to.
But whether he’s fishing with 
teammates, his dad or all alone, 
it doesn’t matter. For York it’s 
all about the escape and the 
experience.

Keith Cooley’s road to becoming Michigan’s first Black gymnast

Keith 
Cooley 
didn’t 
go 
to 
Michigan to be an athlete. He didn’t 
grow up dreaming of performing 
in front of fans or going to the 
Olympics — he went to Michigan 
to be a physicist, and he left a 
physicist. Yet somewhere along 
that journey, he became Michigan’s 
first Black gymnast in 1966 as a 
trampolinist.
Growing up, he didn’t have a 
gymnastics team to play on, or even 
his own trampoline to bounce on. 
Instead, he had a friend.
“I lived in Pontiac, which is a 
pretty rough, poor town, but I had 
friends who lived in Bloomfield 
Hills and their dad bought them 
a trampoline,” Cooley told The 
Daily. “From time to time my mom 
brought me out to be with them for 
an afternoon and I would bounce 
on the trampoline. From maybe 
like 13, 14 years old. And so anytime 
I could do it with them I would go 
out there.”
That passion extended to his first 
year at Michigan, where — when 
unable to join the trampolining 
class first semester — he found time 
to go down to the gym and bounce 
anyways.
“They 
would 
leave 
the 
trampolines out — you were on 
your own, if you got hurt it was 
your problem — but I would go 
bounce,” Cooley said. “So I bounced 
probably 4 or 5 days a week. I would 
go before classes, I would skip 
lunch, I would go after school’s out 
and before dinner and I just get up 
and bounce and play around a bit.”
Cooley received pointers from 
members of the gymnastics team, 
who started to recognize the 
stranger frequenting the gym, and 
he improved. But in his second 
semester freshman year, he finally 
got the proper teaching he needed 
by making it into the trampolinist 
class taught by gymnastics coach 
Newt Loken.
Excelling, 
Cooley 
was 
encouraged by Loken to try out 
for the gymnastics team the next 
year. Although Cooley claimed he 
didn’t have the necessary skills, 
Loken persisted and rented out 
a trampoline for him over the 
summer and sent it to his house. A 
spot wasn’t guaranteed, but Loken 
would give the newcomer all the 
opportunities he could.
“All I had was a book a coach 
wrote 
about 
gymnastics, 
and 
in it there was a section called, 

‘Trampolining,’ ” Cooley said. “I 
had to remember to keep my toes 
pointed, I had to remember how 
to make your body rotate as a twist 
or a tumble. I had to make sure I 
remembered to land full or three 
quarters, on your stomach or back. 
But it came along, it came along.”
He made the team, and after 
practicing with the team for a year 
due to the Big Ten’s rule against 
athletes 
competing 
their 
first 
year of eligibility, Cooley became 
Michigan’s first Black gymnast to 
compete in competition. Balancing 
both an engineering degree and the 
heavy workload of gymnastics, he 
competed as the third trampolinist 
on the squad.
Cooley 
never 
felt 
singled 
out because of his race on the 
gymnastics team — there was an 
“air of respect,” he said — and 
Loken never tolerated racism, 

constantly seeking to right the 
wrongs. But there was one moment 
where the color of Cooley’s skin 
definitely played a part.
The year he made the gymnastics 
team, two of his friends decided it 
would be a good idea to try out for 
the cheerleading — then called yell-
leading — team and invited Cooley 
along with them. They said they’d 
talk to the athletic director, H.O. 
“Fritz” Crisler. A week of silence 
followed from his friends, until 
finally Cooley had to confront the 
clearly uncomfortable pair over 
the situation with the yell-leading 
team.
Crisler wouldn’t let him on the 
team. Too many boosters went to 
football games, and Crisler decided 
a Black yell-leader wouldn’t go over 
well with the boosters.
“I was a little crestfallen,” 
Cooley recalls. “Actually, I was a 

lot crestfallen, but I didn’t press 
it. I think (Loken) may have gone 
and asked on my behalf, but he 
didn’t say anything. Normally for 
Newt if it was something like that 
that wasn’t right he would say, ‘No 
that isn’t right, why don’t you go 
ask him,’ he was right behind me. 
And he didn’t say a word, I think 
he knew that the AD had said no. 
I was a bit embarrassed and a little 
bit down about it, but I let it go.”
The same year he could’ve been 
a yell-leader, his 1966 season, 
Cooley acquitted himself well on 
the trampoline. He wasn’t world-
class like his teammates Wayne 
Miller and Dave Jacobs, he didn’t 
win the Big Ten Championship or 
NCAA Championship like they did, 
respectively. But he stood his own 
in a sport as demanding as college 
gymnastics. 
At the end of the year, though, 

Cooley came face to face with 
a decision on what to commit 
himself to — physics or gymnastics. 
A professor confronted him about 
his lax attendance, then proceeded 
to ask him: Would he make more 
money as a trampolinist or a 
physicist?
A 
third 
generation 
Black 
college student in the 1960s, 
Cooley prided himself on going 
to Michigan — when confused 
people congratulated him on going 
to Michigan State, it upset him. 
Physics was a future, bouncing was 
a hobby.
When he broke the news to 
Loken, the coach took it in stride. 
And remembering Cooley’s first 
year on campus, told him that any 
time he wanted to bounce he could 
come down to the gym. Cooley 
rarely did, trampolining was an 
addiction and he needed to go cold 
turkey. The next year, he graduated.
His interviews are ripe with 
statements 
about 
believing 
in 
oneself and rooted in his experience 
as a Black gymnast when there 
were very few Black gymnasts, as 
being a Black engineer when there 
were very few Black engineers.
Cooley lived with nine football 
players; 
he 
partied 
at 
Black 
fraternities. Race and the Civil 
Rights movement of the 60s was 
often a conversation with his 
roommates and friends, but was 
steered clear of on the gymnastics 
team. His aspirations for social 
equality, publicly, were modest as 
an undergrad.
As a graduate at Michigan, he 
helped start the program Minority 
Engineering Project Office, to 
help recruit minority students 
from schools into engineering and 
to promote engineering among 
minorities. In his professional 
career, he became CEO of a non-
profit called Focus: HOPE, to 
fight for civil and human rights in 
Detroit.
Cooley’s interviews are laden 
with motivation, urging people to 
believe in themselves, to fight for 
their ambitions, to make bridges 
where there are none. He ends 
his emails with the Jimi Hendrix 
quote, “When the power of love 
overcomes the love of power the 
world will know peace.”
All those beliefs are fueled by 
his experience as a Wolverine, 
from practicing his way onto the 
gymnastics team to navigating a 
white college. He went to Michigan 
to become a physicist and he left as 
Michigan’s first Black gymnast.
