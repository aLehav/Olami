After 
an 
unsuccessful 

attempt at repealing the entire 
Affordable Care Act, President 
Donald Trump’s administration 
repealed a mandate that required 
employers to provide free birth 
control coverage, which currently 
gives more than 55 million women 
access to birth control.

These stipulations will allow a 

wide range of employers to deny 
birth control coverage, including 
those with “moral convictions” 
against the drug. Because of 
this, it is estimated hundreds 
of thousands of women will no 
longer be able to afford their birth 
control, which was free of cost 
under the Affordable Care Act.

“Congress has a consistent 

history of supporting conscience 
protections for moral convictions 
alongside protections for religious 
beliefs,” the administration said in 
a statement.

The 
mandate 
expands 

exemptions from only religious 
institutions to all organizations, 
including 
hospitals 
and 

universities. According to The 
New York Times, Trump said 
these mandates will prevent 
employers from being “bullied by 
the federal government because 
of their religious beliefs” and 
prevent “risky sexual behavior” 
among adolescents.

However, 
LSA 
sophomore 

Helena 
Harmon, 
executive 

board member of the FemDems 

committee of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said the argument 
that the mandates will protect 
freedom of religion is thinly 
veiled considering the vagueness 
of “moral convictions” allows for 
anyone to decline birth control 
coverage.

“It’s totally a guise and a 

political move to appeal to further 
right groups,” she said. “I think 
it just shows that controlling 
womens’ bodies has become a 
political issue.”

However, 
some 
pro-life 

students 
think 
since 
some 

birth 
control 
methods 
like 

abortifacients prevent an embryo 
from attaching to the uterine wall, 
no tax dollars should be going 
towards them. Nicole Hocott, 

LSA sophomore and president of 
Students for Life, said because the 
mandate affects abortifacients, 
she is glad her tax dollars don’t 
have to go toward them.

“If Planned Parenthood is 

technically not allowed to use 
tax dollars to fund abortion, then 
neither should our tax dollars be 
used for that which is essentially 
an abortion,” Hocott said. “In 
terms of other birth control that 
are not abortifacients and just 
block fertilization or ovulation, 
I am not completely sure on 
my stance, but I do know that I 
understand why someone would 
not want their money going 
toward something they see as so 
wrong, as this has to do with life 
and death, families and culture.”

The breadth of the mandate, 

which 
allows 
universities 
to 

decline coverage, also concerned 
some 
students. 
However, 

Women’s 
Studies 
professor 

Joanne Bailey said University 
employees likely do not need to 
worry about losing their coverage 
based on these provisions.

“Generally 
religious 

universities like Notre Dame 
and other traditionally Catholic 
universities 
that 
would 
be 

opposed to birth control would 
be in the category of those who 
would be affected by this,” Bailey 
said.

Harmon 
agreed 
University 

students 
and 
employees 

likely won’t be affected, and 
furthermore 
said 
women 
in 

our generation are privileged to 

According to Send Silence 

Packing — a campaign designed 
to raise awareness of student 
suicide and to connect students 
to mental health resources on 
university campuses — one 
of every two college students 
thinks about attempting suicide 
at some point. 

Tuesday, 
the 
Diag 
was 

covered by backpacks — each 
of them representing one of the 
1,100 college students who take 
their own life every year.

LSA junior Summer LaPointe 

said this number surprised her.

“The number is lower than I 

thought, but I’m not exactly sure 
why,” she said. “As someone who 
struggles with suicidal ideation 
even still, I think it really 
impresses me that so many of us 
are able to continue living and 
not die, and it also makes me sad 
that as many as 1,100 have killed 
themselves and it doesn’t seem 
like ‘that much.’ ”

These 
backpacks 
were 

part of a travelling exhibition 
called Send Silence Packing.

Since gaining full control of the White House, Senate and House, GOP has attempted repeal

Since the Affordable Care Act 

was signed into law by President 
Barack Obama in March 2010, 
Republicans have made its repeal a 
central piece of their party platform. 
Since gaining full control of the 

White House, the Senate and the 
House of Representatives, various 
Republicans have made multiple 
attempts at repeal, falling just a few 
Senate votes short each time.

But that hasn’t stopped President 

Donald Trump from utilizing the 
full capabilities of the executive 
branch to dismantle the program 
and undermine its effectiveness. 

His administration has cut the open 
enrollment period for the individual 
marketplace in half (and during said 
period shuts down the healthcare.
gov website for 12 hours every 
Sunday), indicated the IRS will not 
enforce the individual mandate 
penalty for people eligible to enroll 
in the marketplace, drastically 
cut funding for navigator groups 

helping people enroll and declined 
to guarantee cost-sharing reduction 
payments to insurance companies, 
among other things.

The effect of all this is particularly 

notable in Michigan, a state that has 
enjoyed relative success in health 
insurance coverage under the ACA. 
From 2009 to 2011, the uninsured

The University of Michigan 

launched an onlinebias response log 
this week amid student requests for 
more administrative transparency 
regarding bias incidents. The log 
details all bias incidents reported 
to, and actions taken by, the Bias 
Response team since July 1.

The 
Bias 
Response 
Team, 

part of the larger Division of 
Student Life, works to maintain 
an inclusive campus environment 
for all students and support those 
who may have been impacted by 
such bias incidents. As noted in the 
log, the team of professional staff 
members also refers victims to 
appropriate University resources as 
needed.

In a statement provided by 

the 
Office 
of 
Public 
Affairs, 

Nicole Banks, assistant dean of 
students, emphasized the level of 
professionalism possessed by those 
on the Bias Response Team.

“This 
team 
of

professionals 
represent 
many 

aspects 
of

University 

community and work to coordinate 
a comprehensive response to each 
individual incident,” Banks said.

The 
growing 
necessity 
to 

distinguish free speech from hate 
speech, especially in context of 
life at the University of Michigan, 
was the central topic of disccusion 
at a panel held Tuesday at the 
University Law School. The panel 
related this topic in relation to 
recent events on and outside 
campus as well as the upcoming 
visit 
of 
controversial 
figure 

Charles Murray this Wednesday. 
The event was co-sponsored by 
the Law School and the Ford 
School of Public Policy.

Dan Korobkin, deputy legal 

director of ACLU Michigan, 
drew much of his talk from his 
own work at the ACLU, where he 
litigates civil liberties issues like 
free speech. Korobkin cited the 

First Amendment as a protection 
to protest an administration, but 
also highlighted its recent use 
in protecting the expression of 
hateful ideologies.

Korobkin claimed the legal 

protection of what we know as 
hate speech and protesting is one 
of the most difficult parts of his 
job, especially when students later 
related this to the Charlottesville, 
Va., 
protests 
in 
which 
an 

estimated 80 percent were armed 
with weaponry.

“They key to me is that the First 

Amendment 
actually 
includes 

the word ‘peaceably’ in it, which 
implies to me that if you are 
planning to have a march for 
political reasons, but also bring 
your guns and do it in a way that 
is designed to intimidate counter-
protesters … that’s not what the 
First Amendment protects,” he

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

Central Student Government joins 
conversation on C.C. Little renaming

LSA SG president Fadanelli introduces the resolution to assembly for first reads

Following the initiatives put 

forth on behalf of LSA Student 
Government, 
Central 
Student 

Government 
briefly 
convened 

Tuesday night to introduce a 
resolution supporting the proposal 
to rename the C.C. Little Science 
Building.

LSA SG President Nicholas 

Fadanelli, an LSA senior, was the 
co-sponsor of the CSG resolution 
with other CSG representatives. 
The 
resolution 
supported 

renaming the C.C. Little Science 
Building and opened discussion on 
the resolution by sharing some of 
the context of it.

“It is very different to remember 

our history — both its dark 
moments and its finer ones — and 
to explicitly glorify a man who 
believed a lot students on this 

campus should not have been 
born,” Fadanelli said. 

Presiding student government 

bodies 
like 
Rackham 
Student 

Government have already passed 
resolutions or discussed efforts in 
support of the 20-page proposal, 
which was put forth by LSA faculty 
and spearheaded by associate 
History professor John Carson.

Fadanelli further pressed CSG 

to take action, calling upon the 
assembly to release a statement in 
support of the name change after 
smaller governing bodies have 
taken part in the support of the 
name change.

“We would love to have CSG 

on board, not only to support the 
policy, but also release a statement 
so that campus knows this is an 
important issue for all of us,” he 
said.

Late last month, in the midst 

of a week of filled with protests 
in response to racist graffiti 

found on the dorms of West Quad 
Residence Hall, LSA SG passed 
a 
resolution 
denouncing 
the 

ex-University President Clarence 
Little’s troubling past, including his 
involvement with eugenics.

That same week, hundreds of 

University students showed up to 
voice their concerns and support 
the name change of the C.C. Little 
Science Building at a public forum 
hosted on behalf of LSA SG at the 
end of the week of protests. The 
protests delayed the panel, which 
was a further point of concern 
for many, as all the speakers were 
white.

Fadanelli said in an earlier 

statement 
he 
supports 
future 

dialogue about renaming the C.C. 
Little Building.

“I just hope that all these people 

that came out here tonight sign the 
petition and we keep having this 
conversation … because this is an 
important conversation to have, 

as much as possible,” Fadanelli 
said.

CSG itself has not released any 

official statement on C.C. Little 
or the series of racist incidents 
on campus, unlike the past 
administration.

CSG 
President 
Anushka 

Sarkar, an LSA senior, has 
tweeted support of students on 
campus and has urged students 
to sign a petition on the renaming 
of the building.

However, the assembly has 

briefly touched on the protests 
that occurred that week and 
other racist incidents, even in 
their attendance in SACUA.

While Sarkar didn’t speak on 

the issue, CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
junior, commented on the effort 
led by LSA SG.

the University’s Bicentennial 
means to them. 

“If you look around the

central part of Active Minds, 
a 
nonprofit 
organization 

dedicated to destigmatizing 
and 
encouraging 
an 
open 

dialogue about mental health. 
The exhibit, though it has 
been 
to 
the 
University’s 

campus years prior, is just one 
of many events organized by 
the University’s LSA Student 
Government as a part of its first 
mental health week, which 
LSA SG plans to hold yearly. 

LSA junior Bekah Cone, who 

helped organize the event, said 
she believes the visual element 
has a large impact.

“I think it’s cool to see the 

actual number, because it is 
one thing to have it in your 
head, but to see the number 
of 
backpacks 
of 
students 

each year — I think it is a 
noninvasive way of bringing 
awareness to mental health 
and suicide,” she said.

Send Silence Packing was 

modeled 
after 
the 
AIDS 

Memorial Quilt, a 54-ton quilt 
made to memorialize those 
who have died in the AIDS 
epidemic. 
Individual 
quilt 

panels are roughly the size 
of an average grave, and are 
stitched by the deceased’s love 
ones. Similarly, many of the 
backpacks in the Send Silence 
Packing 
exhibition 
were 

donated by families who lost a 
college student to suicide.

Many of the backpacks have 

personal stories of the deceased 
attached to them, written by 
their family members and 
friends. Powerful signs and 
phrases like, “Stigma is shame. 
Shame causes silence. Silence 
hurts us all” are scattered 
among the backpacks.

Send Silence Packing goes on 

two tours every year, traveling 
to 12 schools this time around. 
Active Minds is scheduled to 
visit Ohio State University and 
Iowa State University later this 
month.

The campaign visited the 

University previously in 2015. 
That year, the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention 
recorded the highest rate of 
suicide among females ages 15 
to 19, more than double the rate 
in 2007. In that same time, the 
suicide rate among males ages 
15 to 19 rose from 10.8 to 14.2 
per 100,000 people.

However, 
new 
statistics 

show the suicide rate in the 
state of Michigan is slightly 
higher 
than 
the 
national 

average. While, as a state, it 
statistically ranks toward the 
middle of the pack —sitting at 
34 of 50 — the suicide rate has 
risen drastically every year in 
Michigan since 2000.

Looking at young people 

specifically, 
Michigan 
also 

ranks 
toward 
the 
middle 

when comparing state suicide 
rates of 15- to 24-year-olds. 
However, in 2016, Washtenaw 
County saw 17 suicides among 
15- 
to 
24-year-olds, 
the 

highest amount of suicides 
ever recorded from the age 
group in the country, which 
has 
been 
documented 
by 

medical 
examiners 
since 

2004. 
These 
numbers 
do 

not include the many who 
attempt suicide, which the 
American 
Foundation 
for 

Suicide Prevention estimates 
to be 25 attempts for every one 
completed.

The 
severity 
of 
mental 

illness is especially prevalent 
on campus. The University 
of 
Michigan 
Counseling 

and 
Psychological 
Services 

reports that 35 percent of 
students have thought about 
or considered suicide. This 
number 
is 
continuously 

increasing, as CAPS sees 130 
to 140 new students a week, 
according to CAPS director 
Todd Sevig. Additionally, a 
survey commissioned by a task 
force organized by former CSG 
President David Schafer found 
that over 91 percent of students 
and 75 percent of faculty 
members had dealt with some 
mental health concern. 

In response, the University 

has developed new programs 
to 
address 
mental 
health 

and suicide. The University’s 
Depression Center and its 
Transforming Research into 
Action to Improve the Lives 
of 
Students 
program 
has 

trained staff at 24 schools 
in 10 Michigan counties on 
ways to help students handle 
and cope with stress through 

cognitive behavioral therapy. 
The program recently received 
a grant, allowing them to begin 
expanding their program to 150 
mental health care providers 
in Michigan. In addition, the 
University has increased the 
budget for CAPS by 66 percent 
over the past 10 years.

However, 
many 
students 

think the University could do 
more to help students with 
mental illness and promote 
awareness. LSA senior Lauren 
Quinlan, who participated in 
the mental health monologues 
last spring, said she believes 
that 
while 
the 
University 

needs to be more active, this 
responsibility lies with the 
students too.

“For many of those who 

suffer from mental illness, it 
is an all day, every day affair,” 
she said. “I think all people, 
not just big institutions, need 
to be more cognizant of the 
effects and tolls mental health 
takes on those who struggle 
with 
it. 
Awareness 
and 

unbiased education can start 
with the University, but we 
as individuals need to carry it 
forth with us every day.”

have grown up with birth control 
coverage being the norm. She 
said the concept of a lack of the 
drug seems to be shocking many 
students.

“I do think we are really lucky 

to go to a public university that 
makes birth control accessible,” 
Harmon said. “But now people are 
realizing that if they didn’t have 
their parents’ insurance or didn’t 
go to a liberal public university that 
they might have their birth control 
lose coverage.”

Regardless of the safety of 

University 
employees, 
Bailey 

stressed the larger issue at hand 
isn’t the repealing of coverage, but 
the fact that coverage is determined 
by employers in the first place. She 
said the idea employers have stake 
in an individual’s personal lives is 
an antiquated idea that stems from 
World War II, and is very different 
from other countries’ methods.

“The fact that employers have 

that power over us is just sort of 
bizarre,” Bailey said. “I believe 
that access to reproductive health 
care, 
including 
contraception, 

should be an individual’s choice, 
not something that should be 
dictated by one’s employer or the 
government or by anyone but the 
individual.”

Harmon said she agreed women’s 

health care is in the wrong hands. 
Apart from insurance being in the 
hands of employers, she said health 
care as a whole is being defined 
from a male perspective that can 
leave women without the specified 
coverage they need.

“What is healthy and necessary 

is determined by and for men, and 
women fall through the cracks a 
lot. As we see now, men deemed 
birth control unnecessary to be 
healthy even though so many 
women use it for reasons other 
than contraception,” Harmon said. 
“There’s just not an understanding 
of what women’s health care is, 
and this administration seems to 
be trying to apply male health care 
needs onto women.”

Contraceptives are often used for 

medical reasons, such as hormonal 
imbalances 
and 
acne, 
besides 

preventing pregnancy, but in the 
provisions these reasons are subject 
to moral rejection as well. Ruth 

Lednicer, 
Planned 
Parenthood 

of Michigan’s director of media 
and communications, reiterated 
the bizarre nature of having an 
employer’s opinions come before 
those of an individual’s doctor.

“They will no longer have access 

to what their doctor prescribed or 
what they think is best for them. 
There’s been arguments that low-
income women will still have the 
ability to get birth control in other 
ways but this isn’t about low-income 
women,” Lednicer said. “This is 
really about working women who 
have insurance that’s part of their 
benefits and now their employer can 
decide parts of their personal lives.”

Moving forward, Lednicer said 

Planned Parenthood has had to 
make some changes based on the 
administration’s priorities. Still, she 
said advocacy and the well-being of 
the individual is their main focus 
right now, not the well-being of 
their institution.

“They are making it very clear 

that they don’t think women 
can make health care decisions 
for themselves. We do expect 
more attempts like this from the 
administration,” 
Lednicer 
said. 

“But, it’s less about how it affects 
Planned Parenthood and more 
about how it affects the individual 
women.”

The ACLU, the Washington 

Attorney General and the National 
Women’s Law Center have already 
prepared 
lawsuits 
against 
the 

administration. According to a 
statement released by Washington 
state’s 
Attorney 
General, 
Bob 

Ferguson, the mandate violates 
the first amendment by “requiring 
individuals to bear the burdens 
of religions to which they do not 
belong.” Additionally, some lawsuits 
called the mandate’s discrimination 
against women a violation of 
the Civil Rights Act. Still, many 
members of the administration 
stand by the constitutionality of the 
provisions.

“No American should be forced 

to violate his or her own conscience 
in order to abide by the laws and 
regulations governing our health 
care 
system,” 
Caitlin 
Oakley, 

Department of Health and Human 
Services’ 
press 
secretary, 
said 

in a statement. “Today’s actions 
affirm the Trump administration’s 
commitment to upholding the 
freedoms afforded all Americans 
under our Constitution.”

Within the same statement, Dean 

of Students Laura Blake Jones noted 
administration 
members 
worked 

deliberately with students and faculty 
to ensure the log is sensitive to the 
needs of those who have been affected 
by bias incidents.

“We 
worked 
carefully 
with 

students 
and 
professional 
staff 

to create a bias incident log that 
shares information publicly while 
maintaining privacy for the affected 
students and other members of our 
community,” Blake Jones said.

Blake Jones further explained 

the details of the log — ranging from 
the date of the bias incident to a full 
summary of responsive action taken 
— will be updated weekly. However, 
as bias incidents are oftentimes 
reported in a general manner to 
preserve the privacy of the victim, 
limited information may be available 
in certain cases.

The launch of this log comes 

in the wake of many acts of hate 
towards communities of color and 
other marginalized groups over the 
past year. Most recently, racist flyers 
encouraging 
students 
to 
“Make 

America White Again” were found 
outside Stockwell Residence Hall last 
week.

Despite administrative response, 

Black students and their allies continue 
to express their disappointment with 

the administration for not being 
more aggressive in dealing with bias 
incidents.

In an earlier interview with The 

Daily, LSA sophomore Kaitlyn Brown 
said she thinks the University needs 
to emphasize strict consequences for 
perpetrators of such incidents.

“They need to be more proactive,” 

she said. “Just sending an email 
doesn’t give the people who do this 
consequences, so I feel like there 
needs to be a form of consequence and 
some kind of way that the University 
comes out and strictly says, ‘We do not 
condone this and if you do this then 
there will be consequences.’ ”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
in 
a 
previous 
Daily 

interview, expressed hope this log 
will aid students in understanding the 
multitude of actions the University 
takes to combat bias incidents, from 
both a personal and campus-wide 
perspective. He emphasized the 
University is not trying to hide such 
incidents when they occur, as it 
would not be productive.

“I think one thing we are doing is 

trying to be more rapidly transparent 
about episodes that occur, so that 
everyone in the community knows 
where to look when they hear a 
rumor about something,” he said. 
“We’re putting up a website that 
gives basically a running summary 
of the events that happened, and 
the results of any investigations and 
practical things. I think that will at 
least help people know what’s going 
on.”

rate in Michigan among those 
under 65 (those not covered by 
Medicare) was 14.6 percent.

Part of this drop was due to 

the expansion of Medicaid –– the 
government’s health insurance 
program for some of the nation’s 
poorest, targeted mainly at 
children and parents –– to make 
more people eligible to enroll. 
The ACA initially required 
every state complete its own 
Medicaid expansion, but when 
that was ruled unconstitutional 
by the Supreme Court, each 
state had to decide for itself. 
Michigan was one of a handful 
of 
completely 
Republican-

controlled states that opted in.

Public 
Health 
professor 

Peter Jacobson explained the 
expansion of Medicaid was 
economically efficient because 
it 
reduces 
the 
number 
of 

emergency medical procedures 
necessary.

“The 
goal 
of 
expanding 

Medicaid to a population with a 
higher percentage of income for 
eligibility was because these are 
the people who are getting their 
care at emergency departments, 

which is the most expensive 
way to provide health care,” he 
said. “By expanding Medicaid 
to more people, it reduces 
the overall cost of providing 
health care, first, and second, 
it provides insurance so that 
people can get the health care 
they need.”

Another 
major 
part 
of 

the statistical drop in the 
uninsured 
was 
driven 
by 

the 
ACA’s 
regulation 
and 

facilitation 
of 
enrollment 

in the individual insurance 
marketplace for people not 
on 
Medicare, 
Medicaid 
or 

employer-provided insurance. 
The ACA increased incentives 
for enrollment by prohibiting 
insurers from denying coverage 
for 
pre-existing 
conditions 

and 
requiring 
every 
plan 

cover certain “essential health 
benefits,” and also increased 
disincentives 
for 
non-

enrollment via the individual 
mandate, which places a tax on 
eligible individuals who do not 
enroll.

Individual 
Marketplace 

Enrollment

One of the most significant 

actions 
the 
Trump 

administration is taking to roll 
back Obama-era enrollment in 
the individual marketplace is 

slashing funding to navigator 
groups –– nonprofits that assist 
individuals 
in 
finding 
and 

enrolling in individual market 
plans. Enroll Michigan, one 
of the largest such groups in 
the state, just saw its funding 
cut 90 percent for 2018. In an 
interview with The Daily Beast, 
Enroll 
Michigan 
Director 

Dizzy Warren said she wasn’t 
certain what the organization’s 
capabilities would now be.

“It’s 
a 
true 
and 
major 

disservice 
to 
Michigan 

consumers,” Warren said. “To 
the best of our ability, we will 
be there. With that kind of 
reduction, there’s no way I can 
say we will definitely be there.”

Any resulting reduction in 

enrollment could be dangerous 
for the stability of the market, 
Jacobson said, as it could upset 
the balance of healthy and sick 
people enrolled.

“Basically the idea behind 

the 
insurance 
exchange 
is 

you have a mix of healthy and 
sicker patients. Ideally, you 
would have a lot of millennials 
signing up –– you’re basically 
healthy, you don’t use a lot of 
health care and those premiums 
can offset the costs of older, 
sicker patients,” he said. “When 
you have fewer young people 

enrolling, it destabilizes the 
market because insurers now 
have to raise premiums on 
people who are sicker. That’s 
the 
so-called 
death 
spiral, 

because the insurers have left 
the market filled with a bunch 
of sick people, and you can’t 
raise rates high enough.”

According to Megan Foster 

Friedman, a health care policy 
analyst for the University-based 
Center for Healthcare Research 
and Transformation, young and 
healthy people are exactly who 
will be affected most by the 
reduction in navigator funding.

“Health 
insurance 
is 

complicated,” she said. “And I 
think folks who are relatively 
healthy, folks that are young 
and haven’t had a whole lot 
of experience signing up for 
coverage, they need that extra 
bit 
of 
assistance 
to 
really 

understand 
why 
they 
need 

health insurance, and what’s 
out there for them.”

Additionally, 
Foster 

Friedman said the effect of 
a much shorter enrollment 
period, which many people 
are not aware of, could be 
devastating.

said.

Korobkin explored the discourse 

surrounding the hate speech versus 
free speech debate. He related 
the faulty “sticks and stones” 
ideology and the assumption that 
hate speech cannot cause any real 
harm. According to Korobkin, 
individuals have used hate speech 
to harm communities, and have 
done so because it has the power to 
harm individuals and belittle them.

While a variety of opinions and 

ideas are important, Korobkin 
asserted 
some 
ideas 
can 
be 

dangerous and have detrimental 
effects on society, especially if 
society allows the government to 
determine what is hate speech; 
individuals will abuse this power 

for their own political agendas.

Nevertheless, 
Korobkin 

explained the importance of being 
an ally to minority groups and 
demanding the University create 
inclusive public spaces and forums 
to introduce more previously 
ignored voices.

“The University doesn’t have to 

be neutral on these issues,” he said. 
“It can and should be an activist 
itself.”

Panelist 
Austin 
McCoy, 
a 

postdoctoral fellow and historian, 
shared his thoughts on protesting 
and free speech largely as an 
activist himself. He emphasized 
the need to prepare strategies 
ahead of time to effectively combat 
dangerous political figures and 
ideas.

McCoy reaffirmed the harm 

that racist posters can have on 
students around campus, citing 
the 
recent 
incident 
outside 

Stockwell Residence Hall and 
previous incidents that struck him 
as especially dangerous because 
they 
encouraged 
reporting 

undocumented immigrants. He 
encouraged students to tear down 
or report these posters, but not 
report about them online, because 
this opens an opportunity for 
online ‘trolls’ to comment and have 
a platform to continue sharing 
racist ideas.

According to McCoy, mass 

action is vital for demanding 
response from the University to 
denounce racist acts. He also said 
while one cannot filter what others 
can say, in a joint effort people can 
make it difficult for individuals 
to express hateful and dangerous 
opinions.

Law 
School 
student 
Leah 

Duncan attended the panel to 
work to process recent events on 
campus.

“I had a general interest in free 

speech and how you balance that 
with protecting students and the 
community in general, from hate 
speech and the harms that it causes 
psychologically and opportunities 
for education in that nature,” she 
said.

Law School student Sarvjeet 

Singh 
came 
with 
fellow 

international 
students 
because 

they were all interested in learning 
more about the laws surrounding 
free speech in the United States.

“Whatever has been happening 

around the campus and in the 
country after the election has 
made it very interesting. Especially 
coming from our countries and 
hearing 
about 
the 
American 

First Amendment and what is a 
protected part of it, I think the 
notion of the fact that racist speech 
can be protected is what brought us 
here to understand that,” he said. 

PANEL
From Page 1A


T

his 
Wednesday, 
the 

University of Michigan 
College 
Republicans 

and 
American 
Enterprise 

Institute 
are 
sponsoring 

Charles 
Murray, 
a 
white 

supremacist, 
to 
speak 
on 

campus and promote his new 
book. Murray, who is a fellow 
at the American Enterprise 
Institute, co-wrote the “The 
Bell Curve” in 1994. The 
publication of this book marked 
the 1990s re-emergence of 
racist eugenics and biological 
determinist 
theories 
using 

pseudo-science, 
linking 
IQ 

to race and claiming white 
intellectual superiority. He is 
considered a white nationalist 
by the Southern Poverty Law 
Center. He is an “alt-right” 
bigot who is emboldened by 
President Donald Trump. 

The 
sponsoring 

organizations have stated to 
The Michigan Daily that they 
want to distance themselves 
from 
the 
“alt-right” 
and 

white supremacist movement. 
If 
they 
are 
sincere, 
they 

should cancel this event. His 
upcoming event has already 
inspired another racist poster 
campaign on campus claiming 
white 
superiority, 
which 

threatens the safety and rights 
of the students and faculty 
at the University, especially 
immigrants, 
Muslims, 
trans 

people, 
women 
and 
other 

minority students who are 
most consistently targeted.

The event must be canceled 

or 
shut 
down. 
Murray’s 

speaking engagements have 
been 
canceled 
at 
colleges 

such as Assumption College, 
Azusa 
Pacific 
University 

and 
protested 
at 
Harvard 

University, Middlebury College 
and some other campuses and 
venues due to safety concerns. 
There 
is 
no 
reasonable 

debate to be had with white 

supremacists. Actions speak 
louder than words. Statements 
from the University logically 
refuting these theories, such 
as the University’s Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan last 
September, are important but 
insufficient. If the University 
means what it says about its 
commitment 
to 
diversity, 

equity and inclusion, the safety 
of its students and requests 
to stop the spread of racist 
violence on our campus, they 
will cancel the event. 

The 
movement 
for 

immigrant 
rights 
and 

against 
Trump 
is 
gaining 

in 
strength, 
even 
forcing 

many 
leading 
Republicans 

to distance themselves from 
Trump. By sponsoring this 
event, the University College 
Republicans 
are 
not 
only 

supporting Trump’s attacks, 
but attempting to strengthen 
the most violent, racist and 
reactionary 
forces 
of 
the 

Trump movement.

This is not an event that any 

college campus should condone 
— it threatens the safety and well-
being of students and faculty 
and threatens the academic 
mission to promote learning and 
leadership. The confrontations 
will not be confined to the 
time and place of the event; 
hate crimes will escalate, and 
innocent 
people 
will 
suffer 

verbal and physical abuses. If 

white supremacists are given 
a platform by the University, 
University administration will 
be directly responsible for aiding 
and allowing bigoted and racist 
attacks to endanger students.

Especially after the horrific 

murder 
of 
Heather 
Heyer 

by a white supremacist in 
Charlottesville, Va., the danger 
of “alt-right,” white supremacist 
and fascist organizing is clear 
to anyone who wants to see 
the 
truth. 
The 
“alt-right” 

and fascists are emboldened 
by Trump’s explicit backing 
of 
racist, 
anti-immigrant 

demagogy and attacks, such 
as his move to repeal Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals.

As long as Donald Trump is 

president, the “alt-right” and 
fascists will be emboldened and 
will continue to organize and 
make attacks. If we continue 
to 
organize 
independently 

and fight in the streets, in our 
schools and in workplaces, the 
resistance movement against 
Trump can force him to resign 
or be removed.

By taking matters into our 

own hands and mobilizing our 
own community defense, we 
have the power to stop racist 
and fascist attacks, to defend 
DACA and win the Dream Act, 
restore affirmative action and 
make all our campuses, cities 
and communities sanctuaries for 
immigrants. Only then will our 
University be truly equal, diverse, 
integrated and inclusive.

A protest is planned to begin 

at the Diag at 4 p.m. Wednesday 
and we are marching to the 
Charles Murray event at Palmer 
Commons. Join us Wednesday 
to protest and defend our 
campus 
community 
against 

racism and immigrant-bashing!

T

hese days, it seems 
everybody 
has 

something 
to 
say. 

People 
of 
all 
political 

affiliations are bound to feel 
wound 
up 
and 
passionate 

about recent events. It’s better 
that our citizens stay engaged 
than 
become 
complacent; 

people who actively involve 
themselves in politics are 
looking out for the country’s 
best interests. Furthermore, 
some of the United States’ 
biggest critics are also its 
biggest patriots, exercising 
the First Amendment rights 
our Founding Fathers fought 
so hard for. As uncomfortable 
as it can be, challenging 
the status quo is the only 
way 
progress 
happens. 

Controversy gets important 
conversations started. 

It baffles me that some 

people call protests such as 
kneeling during the anthem 
“un-American.” Quite frankly, 
what is more American than a 
non-disruptive act of defiance? 
Many sports players do this to 
protest police brutality and 
racial resentment that have 
been crippling the country for 
some time now.

And yet, people implore 

football players to stick to the 
sport next time. People label 
these players as ungrateful 
for criticizing the country 
that allowed them to reach 
such heights in the NFL. 
Both of these arguments not 
only silence these football 
players 
but 
delegitimize 

them as human beings. These 
football players are more than 
just your Sunday afternoon 
entertainment. 
They 
have 

lives outside their profession 
and have voices that deserve 

to be heard just as loud 
as everybody else’s. Their 
success does not blind them to 
the pertinent issues of today.

The same can be said for 

all celebrity activists. Take 
a look at the 2017 Emmys: 
Celebrities ranging from Alec 
Baldwin to Donald Glover to 
Jane Fonda all took shots at 
the 
Trump 
administration 

throughout the show. This 
politicization of the Emmys 
remained a topic of debate 
all throughout the next day; 
many conservative television 
personalities expressed their 
disgust with the Emmys and 
disclosed plans to not watch 
them next year.

ESPN 
host 
Jemele 
Hill 

received calls — some directly 
from White House officials 
— for her to be fired after she 
posted a series of anti-Trump 
tweets. It would be one thing 
if Hill’s criticisms were said on 
air amidst a sports segment. 
But why shouldn’t she be able 
to express her own opinions 
on her own personal Twitter 
account? Should working in 
the sports industry limit her 
to talking about sports only?

Late-night talk show host 

Jimmy Kimmel also veers 
away 
from 
his 
comedic 

content to get political from 

time to time. On Oct. 1, tens of 
thousands of people gathered 
in Las Vegas to watch country 
star Jason Aldean perform. 
Yet, 59 lives were cut short 
and over 500 people were 
injured in what is now the 
deadliest mass shooting in U.S. 
history. Kimmel delivered an 
emotional and passionate plea 
against such senseless acts on 
his show the following day, 
and people were mad at him 
for not sticking to comedy? 
Comedy 
is 
derived 
from 

current events, but sometimes 
the current events transcend 
the realm of comedy and must 
be talked about in a serious 
manner. Kimmel’s show gives 
him the perfect platform to 
discuss these issues, and it 
would be foolish for anyone to 
not take advantage of this.

Some people claim celebrities 

shouldn’t try to speak on behalf 
of the “ordinary folk,” given 
the extent of their privilege. 
The way I see it, whoever has 
privilege has the responsibility 
to use that power to help those 
who are less privileged. This is 
exactly what these celebrities 
are doing.

I 
don’t 
have 
sympathy 

for 
those 
who 
find 
the 

politicization of NFL games, 
award shows, comedy shows, 
etc. 
unwatchable. 
We 
do 

not have a monopoly on the 
content of such programs. We 
all have family and friends 
who post political rants on 
Facebook and with whom we 
often disagree, yet we are able 
to look past this disparity and 
carry on.

So why can’t we do the same 

with celebrities?

Want kids to stay in school?

BILLY STAMPFL | COLUMN

I 

never found school to be all 
that boring. I kind of liked 
high school, with its different 

clubs and sports teams to join, cool 
people to meet and interesting 
things to learn. 

Given my positive perspective 

of school, I was alarmed to read 
that 1.2 million students drop out 
of United States high schools each 
year. That’s one student every 26 
seconds. That means about four 
high schoolers have dropped out 
since I started typing this column.

Do kids really think high 

school is that bad? Why do they 
choose to drop out?

In the 20th century, three 

prominent researchers — Jonathan 
Doll, a fellow at Harvard’s Center 
for Education Policy Research, 
and Zohreh Eslami and Lynne 
Walters, associate professors of 
teaching, learning and culture at 
Texas A&M University — proposed 
the main factors that led kids to 
drop out of high schools fell into 
three categories: students “pushed 
out” when affected by adverse 
influences, students “pulled out” 
by personal circumstances that 
prevented them from graduating 
and, 
finally, 
students 
“falling 

out” when they do “not show 
significant academic progress in 
schoolwork and becomes apathetic 
or even disillusioned with school 
completion.” While “pulled out” 
and 
“pushed 
out” 
comprised 

factors like financial difficulties 
or enlistment in the armed forces, 
“falling out” essentially means the 
dropout got tired of going to school.

This last one caught my eye: 

According to the 2002 iteration 
of the study, 14.3 percent of the 
subjects dropped out of high school 
because they became apathetic 
or 
disillusioned 
with 
school 

completion. You might argue that 
things have changed since 2002, 
but a Business Insider article from 
2015 reported that 25.9 percent of 
dropouts quit school simply due to 
boredom. But high school dropouts 
are a population in which, as of 
2009, the average worker makes 
$20,241 per year, and 31 percent 

between the ages of 18 and 24 live 
in poverty. Still, nearly 15 percent 
of the population of high school 
dropouts reject school because they 
just don’t like it?

Do they know the alternatives?
If we want to keep kids in school, 

we should teach them just what 
constitutes the alternative: a labor-
intensive, physical job that makes 
them wish they hadn’t ditched that 
air-conditioned classroom.

I appreciate this because I 

worked a part-time job at UPS 
this summer, one that is nearly 
identical to many entry-level labor 
jobs that you could get without a 
high school diploma.

The workday at UPS would 

last about five hours. We’d start 
at a set time announced toward 
the end of the previous day. I’d 
pull into the parking lot every 
workday 15 minutes before start 
time with a sinking feeling in 
my stomach. I wasn’t nervous. I 
wasn’t afraid. I wasn’t angry. But 
it felt like my gut was being pulled 
down by some package-induced 
gravitational force.

Before I entered the complex, I’d 

have to go through a metal detector 
— no phones are allowed in the 
building. They say it’s because the 
metal or the signal or something 
interferes with the scanners, but we 
all knew that the supervisors just 
didn’t want us getting distracted.

Walking into the guard office a 

hundred yards from the complex 
was almost the worst part of the 
day. It always smelled like yogurt. 
Probably because the guard ate a lot 
of it — the vanilla kind, I think. He 
had a mustache, salt- and pepper-
colored with specks of yogurt in it.

After passing through the shack, 

I walked to the main building where 
all the packages moved from semis 
to sorters to actual UPS delivery 
trucks. I really don’t know how the 
whole system worked, actually; I 
liked to get in, do my job and get out.

Speaking of my job: I was on 

“the unload,” so I had a number of 
responsibilities that ranged widely 
in scope and needed to be handled 
in a timely and reliable manner. 

Just kidding. I picked up packages 
and I put them on a conveyer belt. 
No, really, that’s pretty much it. 
They were heavy, I had to be fast 
and I had to make sure the label 
was facing up, but that was my job. 
I remember when I interviewed 
and the lady said I’d probably be 
unloading packages. That can’t be 
too hard, I thought. That seems cool.

I thought.
The trailers we unloaded were 

jam-packed with boxes and hot air. 
A steady smell, one of sweat and 
cardboard, blanketed each truck. 
We’d extend the conveyer belt into 
the truck and place the packages 
one by one on the moving belt.

Sometimes I got to unload 

trailers with a partner. This was 
easier, and the conversations could 
be interesting. I met nice guys at 
UPS; they all liked sports and music, 
and we shared a bubbling hatred for 
the job.

We’d get a 10 minute break 

around halfway through the night. 
This was when a mass of people 
would march out of the east exit 
and smoke cigarettes. The non-
smokers, like me, went to the break 
area, a small room that looked like 
a 1970s diner. It had orange booths 
and wood-paneled walls, with a TV 
that always played grainy Chuck 
Norris movies.

When the night ended I would 

clock out and head to the guard 
shack, where the mustachioed 
yogurt man bid everyone farewell 
with his metal detector. An empty 
yogurt cup lay by his clipboard. I 
smelled like sweat and cardboard. 
My arms felt heavy and my eyes 
stung from all the dust in the 
trailers. My fingers were sticky 
with ink. I longed for an air-
conditioned classroom, where all 
the ink went onto blank pages and 
dust was found only in the library, 
on the books no one ever checked 
out. There was yogurt, but only a 
little, and only in the lunchroom. 
I wanted the classroom back. Why 
would anyone leave school?

Rihanna is taking the world 

by storm — but not in her usual 
manner.

In 
early 
September, 
she 

released 
her 
makeup 
line, 

Fenty Beauty, and it received 
almost-instant praise for the 
line’s quality products and 
unique colors. It launched as a 
makeup line that is dedicated 
to 
inclusivity, 
offering 
40 

shades of makeup in an effort 
to target all skin tones and 
shades. Rihanna has put her 
incredible career in the music 
industry on hold and has 
traded that success for a bit of 
glory in the business world.

Her interest in starting this 

line came from observing her 
mother’s love for makeup, and 

as time went on, she grew to 
love it herself. The world of 
bloggers and fashion insiders 
have claimed that the Fenty 
brand is truly worth the hype, 
as many responded to the 
launch with great reviews, 
believing that Rihanna has 
risen 
to 
the 
challenge 
of 

creating makeup that reaches a 
wide range of customers.

What I love about this launch 

is how it clearly represents 
the flaws in our established 
industries. 
Rihanna 
moved 

from a thriving music career 
(which I don’t doubt she will 
return to), and decided to put a 
real and honest idea towards a 
range of products. The beauty 
industry 
has 
established 
a 

norm of releasing makeup lines 
with products that only reach 
people with certain skin tones, 
and it inevitably limits the 
choices for what people can 

purchase. On the Fenty Beauty 
website, the brand states that 
the product line was created 
after Rihanna continued to 
see “a void in the industry for 
products that performed across 
all skin types and tones.”

She 
has 
disrupted 
an 

industry that is stuck in a rigid 
system of releasing a limited 
amount of products, and then 
increasing shade options if 
there is a “need.” I’m not 
sure why a business wouldn’t 
consider the development of 
shade ranges for darker skin 
tones and lighter skin tones 
an urgent need. Instead, for 
years, the beauty industry has 
remained 
limited. 
Rihanna 

offers something new, and it 
is so refreshing to see from 
someone who doesn’t claim to 
be the leader of the industry. 

She 
just 
entered 
with 
an 

interest, and surpassed the 
brands that have already been 
there. Her brand emphasizes 
that 
makeup 
should 
not 

pressure anyone into thinking 
they have to look a certain way 
— it should just be enjoyable.

Rihanna’s 
success 

illuminates a larger idea that 
I think is worth unpackaging. 
We often operate under this 
assumption that there is a 
“right” way to do things. 
The top beauty brands of the 
industry, like Estee Lauder 
or M.A.C. follow a “system” 
of running their businesses. 
They establish norms, which 
determine what products are 
released, 
which 
consumers 

are targeted, and what their 
goals are as a brand. Often 
the 
releases 
from 
these 

established brands only offer a 
few shades of foundation, and 
model the makeup on the same 

skin shades in every launch. 
These brands have used a lot 
of their resources to uphold 
consistency, and produce what 
they know will sell. Rihanna 
came in with an interest, 
thinking under simple terms: 
She loves makeup and wanted 
to create a line that includes all 
types of people, who may look 
different, but all love the same 
products. 

We often rely on the familiar 

mantra: “It is what it is,” when 
faced with a problem or a 
trend that feels too far along to 
change. It is not impossible to 
make change happen. Rihanna 
chose to disrupt the beauty 
industry, and alter its obvious 
problems. Many of us have a 
list of things we wish we could 
improve, and sometimes think 

it is not worth the effort to try. 
If Fenty serves as our example, 
we see that it is very much 
possible — and often necessary 
— to bring new perspectives to 
older systems, that are in dire 
need of reform.

If there is a business, an 

organization, a campaign or 
a belief that you feel you can 
contribute to, I suggest you go 
after it. We place an emphasis 
on experience and “learning 
the ropes” of the system, which 
no doubt holds some merit. 
But often, I think those who 
truly thrive are the ones who 
never let the status quo deter 
them from creating change. 
The 
belief 
that 
we 
need 

established precedent, or a 
“known” name in entering the 
spotlight often loses its value 
when someone new steps in, 
and prospers, having identified 
the very problem all the others 
overlooked.

‘Couple’ tells of teen love

“Tales

TV REVIEW

HBO

Larry David returns to HBO. Just look at that return. Wow.
Nothing (and everything) 
changed in ‘Curb’’s ninth

The return has a bumpy start but shows potential for the future

Larry David’s (“Seinfeld”) 

“Curb Your Enthusiasm” is 
a lot of things: Cringe-TV, a 
haven for celebrity cameos 
and, above all, a commentary 
on social customs. That last 
piece has become the defining 
feature of the series as it enters 
its ninth season. A ruthless 
“social assassin,” Larry uses 
“Curb” to call bullshit on all 
the social conventions we hold 
dear, holding nothing back.

While 
a 
longtime 
fan 

of “Curb,” I feel I’ve only 
recently 
began 
to 
truly 

appreciate Larry’s perpetual 
offensiveness 
in 
our 

hypersensitive climate. I think 
it’s valuable to have such an 
unabashedly rude and childish 
character — one who revels in 
having others detest him — on 
such a prominent show today. 
It’s almost cathartic to watch.

As 
HBO’s 
marketing 

machine went into full swing 
this past summer, I started 
to become anxious as my 
Facebook feed flooded with 
“Curb” ads adorned with the 
tagline, “Nothing has changed” 
alongside a photo of Larry. 
While I had no doubt that 
Larry would return to being 
a complete ass, I worried the 
show would change too much 
after 
being 
off-the-air 
for 

over seven years. Now having 
re-watched 
“Curb”’s 
latest 

episode “Foisted!” a few times, 
I must say that my fears have 
been realized, at least in part.

The episode opens with 

Larry singing in the shower as 
he struggles to open a bottle of 
shampoo. Smacking the bottle 
against various surfaces to no 
avail, Larry finally lashes out 
and hurls the bottle against 
the ground, breaking its plastic 
protector. The gag itself is sort-
of funny, but I couldn’t help but 
be reminded of nearly the exact 
same scene — except with 
different packaging — during 
season 
seven’s 
“Vehicular 

Fellatio.” While I’m all for 
shows sticking to their proven 
scripts, this scene felt utterly 
copied-and-pasted.

Fortunately, “Curb” doesn’t 

spend long on this scene, 
quickly moving toward one of 
the main jokes of the episode, 
as Larry declines to hold the 
door for Betty (Julie Goldman, 
“The People’s Couch”), who 
he later learns is Jeff’s (Jeff 
Garlin, 
“The 
Goldbergs”) 

barber. 
Discovering 
that 

Betty is engaged to her more-
feminine 
partner 
Nooma 

(Nasim Pedrad, “Despicable 
Me 2”), Larry breaks the news 
to her that she’s “not a bride” 
and should let Nooma be the 
groom in their wedding. It’s 
kind of funny in and of itself 
that Larry, a cranky, old, 
by-the-book Jewish guy, is 
getting involved with a lesbian 
wedding. Beyond 
its 
satirical 

qualities, I like 
that 
“Curb” 
is 

confident enough 
in itself to address 
one of the more 
controversial 
subjects 
in 

society 
today, 

even though the 
series has never 
shied from offending viewers.

Returning to the office after 

his haircut, Larry learns that 
his assistant, Mara (Carrie 
Brownstein, “Portlandia”) has 
missed the past two days of 
work since she is constipated. 
Mara is already on Larry’s 
bad side, so her unnecessary 
absences only further incite 
Larry’s rage. It wouldn’t be 
“Curb” if Larry wasn’t feuding 
with his assistant.

In typical Larry fashion, 

he brings up his dilemma 
with 
Leon 
(J.B. 
Smoove, 

“Date Night”) — he can’t fire 
Mara because she’s crippled 
— and Leon rips Mara for 
using 
constipation 
as 
an 

excuse, claiming: “I shot a 
porno constipated… I was in a 
fuckin’ hot-dog eating contest 
constipated.” The two then 
realize that Jimmy Kimmel 
(“Jimmy 
Kimmel 
Live!”) 

“foisted” her on Larry because 
he couldn’t fire her either. For 
me, this was easily the funniest 
scene in the episode due to 
Smoove’s confident delivery 
of such an absurd line, not 
to mention that “foisted” is 
another instance of “Curb”’s 
brilliant terminology. Between 
“foisted” 
and 
“lampin’” 
— 

“black slang,” according to 
Leon — this episode provides 
some quality additions to the 
series’ unique lexicon.

Recognizing he now must 

“foist” Mara onto someone 
else, Larry raves about her to 
Susie (Susie Essman, “Bolt”) 
when she mentions she needs 
an assistant for her growing 
business SoapsOn. Along the 
way, Larry makes sure to rip 
Susie for the company’s name, 
“Could you come up with a 

worse name than SoapsOn?” 
Susie trashes Larry for his 
comment, before convincing a 
faux-hesitant Larry to let Susie 
hire away Mara. Larry plays 
up his reluctance to let Mara 
leave perfectly in this scene, 
almost too well, as he ends 
the shot with his trademark 
line “pretty, pretty, pretty, 
pretty good.” While David’s 
reliance on classic Larry gags 

and quotes works 
well here, “Curb” 
could 
stand 
to 

let a scene go by 
without 
David 

overplaying 
his 

own 
persona. 

That’s my main 
issue with this 
episode — David 
seems like he is 
trying too hard 

to live up to the reputation his 
character has earned, spending 
each scene going over-the-top 
in his performance as Larry.

David’s 
overacting 
aside, 

the episode remains strong. 
Having successfully “foisted” 
Mara onto an unsuspecting 
Susie, Larry has Leon fill-in 
as his assistant. As expected, 
Leon 
struggles 
to 
fulfill 

nearly every one of his duties, 
especially with helping Larry 
prepare for his “Jimmy Kimmel 
Live!” appearance. Larry is 
booked on the show to market 
his newly-penned Broadway 
musical 
comedy 
“Fatwa!” 

about Salman Rushdie’s fatwa 
(death sentence) issued by 
an Iranian Ayatollah. In the 
green room backstage, Larry 
and Kimmel — in an excellent 
cameo — joke about Kimmel’s 
“foisting” of Mara onto Larry. 
Their chemistry is outstanding, 
as Kimmel’s more reserved, 
composed persona meshes well 
with Larry’s unhinged energy 
and love of hearing his own 
voice.

Once 
Kimmel’s 
actual 

show starts, Larry quickly 
runs 
into 
problems. 
After 

Leon neglects to relay Jeff’s 
message warning him about 
mocking 
the 
Ayatollah 
on 

Kimmel’s 
program, 
Larry 

finds himself on the receiving 
end of his own “fatwa,” with 
his impersonation prompting 
Muslim 
leaders 
to 
call 

for Larry’s death. I never 
envisioned a “Curb” episode 
involving 
Muslim 
death 

sentences, but here we are, and 
it’s glorious. If only Larry could 
tone down his performance, 
then “Curb” could truly shine 
this season.

Idria Elba. Need I say more.
Survival narratives & the 
failure of ‘The Mountain’

New ‘The Mountain Between Us’ comes close to becoming a 
successful survival story, but falls short due to multiplicity

For those who love the 

genre, “The Mountain Between 
Us” promised to be another 
stressful 
but 
compelling 

movie about humans trapped 
in the hellish nightmare of 
the wild. The movie’s initial 
marketing framed it as a 
survival narrative, complete 
with people stranded in a 
deserted landscape, makeshift 
tools from limited resources 
and the obsessive hunt for 
food and water. Rather than 
sticking to the archetype of 
the 
genre, 
“The 
Mountain 

Between Us” veered painfully 
into the nonexistent niche of 
cheesy romantic dramas set in 
extreme climates.

A plane crash on a snowy 

mountaintop 
forces 
two 

strangers, Alex (Kate Winslet, 
“Collateral Beauty”) and Ben 
(Idris Elba, “The Dark Tower”), 
to rely on each other to survive 
the elements and trek back to 
civilization. The film begins as 
a classic survival narrative; the 
two are stranded in the remote 
wild, Ben crafts a makeshift 
splint for Alex’s broken leg, 
and the pair overcome cougar 
attacks, frigid temperatures, 
mountain crags and frozen 
lakes to eventually make it 
back to society.

The 
beginning 
of 
“A 

Mountain 
Between 
Us” 

aligns 
with 

the 
subgenre 

of 
survival 

narratives called 
the 
“Stranded 

Story.” Films of 
this subgenre are 
characterized 
by 
a 
critical 

moment 
that 

leaves 
the 

protagonist 
stranded 
in 

nature, 
with 

little 
hope 
of 

rescue, 
that 

forces the him 
or her (in this 
case 
both) 
to 

interact with the 
environment in 
innovative ways 
to survive. Winslet and Elba’s 
hopeless situation recalls the 
similar plight of Tom Hanks 
in “Castaway,” James Franco 
in “127 Hours” and Suraj 
Sharma in “Life of Pi.” While 
set in drastically different 
environments, 
these 
three 

films are almost parallel in 
their story arc; the narrative 
chronology involves a critical 
disaster, 
potential 
rescue 

efforts, coming to terms with 
the situation and surviving 
among the elements.

Each main character is left 

completely 
isolated 
for 
an 

extended period of time, and 
he must use the resources at 
their disposal to fulfill the 
human need for food, water 
and 
shelter. 
The 
jarring 

back 
and 
forth 
between 

relative control and complete 
desperation elicits a sense of 

clawing anxiety for both the 
character and the audience. In 
order to deal with his isolation, 
each man creates a physical 
manifestation of himself to 
serve as a human placeholder. 
Hanks creates Wilson, Sharma 
imagines Richard Parker and 
Franco talks to himself through 
a video camera. These objects 
provide 
comfort 
and 
work 

as springboards for strategy 
sessions. 
While 

the 
audience 

knows Wilson is 
just a volleyball, 
they 
also 

accept the fact 
that 
Wilson’s 

presence is the 
only thing that 
gives Hanks the 
will to survive.

“The Mountain 

Between 
Us” 

doesn’t 
feature 

a 
snowman 

companion because it doesn’t 
have to. Alex and Ben have each 
other to discuss plans and talk 
about life. In fact, they tend 
to talk more about the past 
than about the situation at 
hand. Instead of concentrating 
on their struggle against the 
elements, the film hones in 
on their burgeoning romantic 
love. The film transitions from 
a focus on the environment 
to a focus on each character’s 
relationship with the other; 
the stakes of being stranded 
in the mountains takes a back 

seat 
to 
Alex 

and Ben getting 
to know each 
other 
through 

inappropriately 
casual 
conversations.

Survival 

narratives don’t 
necessarily 
involve 
a 

life-or-death 
struggle against 
the 
elements. 

The 
“Hero’s 

Journey,” 
the 

other subgenre 
of 
survival 

narratives, 
involves 
a 

willing journey 
into 
nature 

for self-discovery and rebirth. 
Emile Hirsch journeys into 
the Alaskan brush in “Into the 
Wild,” 
Reese 
Witherspoon 

hikes the Pacific Crest Trail in 
“Wild,” and Mia Wasikowska 
explores the Australian desert 
in “Tracks.” Nature in these 
films provides an escape from 
the trappings of society and a 
space in which the protagonist 
can reflect on the past.

The hero’s interaction with 

people along the way, and how 
they influence his or her mental 
journey, is also a major theme 
of this subgenre. Wasikowska 
relies on camel farmers and 
aboriginal guides for her trek 
across the Australian desert, 
but the journey is largely 
for herself. The wild is also 
romanticized, but nature can 
be unforgiving. Hirsch revels 
in his Alaskan paradise, but 

dies from eating a poisonous 
plant hauntingly similar to its 
harmless 
look-a-like. 
These 

survival 
narratives, 
again, 

focus on the environment’s 
influence on the human body 
and psyche.

While 
Alex 
and 
Ben 

don’t 
purposefully 
isolate 

themselves in the snow, their 
environment provides a space 
for them to reflect on their 

marriages 
and 

their 
happiness. 

Eventually 
the 

tundra 
becomes 

a backdrop for a 
getting-to-know-
you process and 
a dramatic reveal 
of 
predictable 

trauma.

The 
romance 

between 
Alex 

and Ben comes 
out of nowhere 
and 
develops 

rapidly. For some reason, Alex 
has an obsessive need to rifle 
through Ben’s things and listen 
to his private voicemails. This 
invasion of privacy doesn’t 
annoy Ben, but rather leads 
directly into a gratuitous and 
unnecessary sex scene. Even 
more frustratingly, the trite 
gender dynamics render Alex as 
a fragile, crippled woman who 
needs constant and miraculous 
saving by a man. Ben even goes 
so far as to bring Alex out of 
a hypothermic coma with a 
makeshift syringe made from 
random scraps.

“The 
Mountain 
Between 

Us” 
doesn’t 
illustrate 
the 

hero’s 
journey 
because 
we 

don’t understand who the hero 
is. Because the film begins 
with the crash, we have no 
attachment to the characters 
and no understanding of who 
they are beyond the pieces 
they tell each other (which 
mostly consists of Alex asking 
“who 
are 
you?” 
and 
Ben 

looking sullen). The film is 
unable to create a meaningful 
relationship between the two 
because it’s almost impossible 
for the audience to become 
invested in characters they 
don’t understand.

Survival 
narratives 
are 

successful 
for 
their 
deeply 

internal exploration into the 
psyche of the single character 
and how it is altered by the 
physical environment around 
him or her. “The Mountain 
Between Us” fails as a survival 
film because of its focus on 
the multiple over the singular. 
With 
two 
characters, 
the 

focus shifts from the dynamic 
between humans and nature 
to only the dynamic between 
humans. The cliché romantic 
subplot 
seems 
drastically 

out of place in the frozen 
and 
unsentimental 
tundra. 

Alex and Ben’s relationship 
proves that a romance cannot 
operate within the genre of a 
survival narrative; a romance 
necessitates 
two 
characters 

while 
a 
survival 
narrative 

requires a single character – 
thus, the two contradict each 
other.

Mitski shreds & shimmers 
for a full house at the Pig 

Last Friday night, 27-year-

old Mitski Miyawaki took the 
stage in front of an eager, sold-
out crowd at the Blind Pig in 
downtown Ann Arbor. After 
opener Stef Chura (a Northern 
Michigan native) delivered a 
stellar, twangy-indie set, Mitski 
appeared, casually shrugged off 
her oversized black zip-up and 
slung on her silver electric bass.

The 
singer-songwriter 
— 

known for her versatile voice and 
knack for dissonance — stopped 
in Ann Arbor on the final leg of 
her American tour. In the coming 
months, the Japanese-American 
musician will be travelling to 
play Hong Kong, Japan and 
Australia before returning to 
the U.S., where she will open for 
Lorde’s Melodrama tour next 
spring.

In the dim, intimate grime 

of the Blind Pig’s standing 
room, Mitski kicked off the 
performance with the driving 
bass notes of “Francis Forever” 
— a fan favorite.

Throughout her fifteen-song 

set, Mitski wore an expression 
that fell somewhere between a 
laser-focused stare and a dreamy, 
distant gaze. Sometimes, her 
presence would shift to match 
her lyrics as they oscillated 
between the vivid metaphors 
of a poet, and the blunt angst 

of a heartbroken teen. During 
“Francis Forever,” as she sang 
the lyrics, “I look up at the gaps 
of sunlight,” Mitski tilted her 
head back and looked longingly 
— hopefully — at the ceiling, then 
gently wincing, she narrowed 
her eyes in icy clarity, her bass 
in crescendo as she sang, “I miss 
you more than anything.” Later, 
at the start of “I Bet on Losing 
Dogs,” Mitski patted her heart 
and raised her eyebrows slightly 
as she sang “My Baby, my baby / 

You’re my baby, say it to me,” as if 
trying to persuade a lover looking 
back at her from the crowd.

The 
set 
was 
speckled 

with these little tinges of the 
unfiltered emotion that fuel 
Mitski’s songwriting. With the 
backing of just a guitarist and 
drummer, the live performance 
enhanced the signature paradox 
of her recorded music: the 
distorted, chaotic urgency of 
the instrumentation juxtaposed 
against Mitski’s pure, angelic 

vocals.

At times, it was difficult to 

hear Mitski’s voice over the 
screechy guitar or thudding 
percussion, 
but 
an 
almost 

constant echo of the crowd spoke 
to the strength of her melodies — 
a quality she values in her work. 
In interviews, she has spoken 
about how she moved around a 
lot growing up, and much of her 
songwriting occurred on-the-
go, with her voice as her sole 
instrument.

“No offense to all of the 

instrumentalists 
out 
there, 

[instruments] 
are 
not 
as 

important to me as the core 
composition, which is to me 
the words and the main vocal 
melody,” she told Rookie in May. 
“I want the songs to be able to 
stand on their own.”

During her hit rock ballad, 

“Your 
Best 
American 
Girl,” 

Mitski 
pulled 
back 
the 

instrumentation and let the 
song’s fluttery verse guide the 
audience (who followed along 
obediently). 
As 
the 
chorus 

dropped and the guitar cracked 
in a shock of electricity, the 
crowd yelled those iconic lyrics, 
“your mother wouldn’t approve 
of how my mother raised me,” 
right back at the band. Like the 
disapproval of a lover’s mother, 
Mitski’s performance was widely 
relatable, yet rooted in the 
sharpness of isolated, individual 
pain; she’s mastered this balance, 
and her bass set the common 
pulse of the crowd last Friday.

Wolverines’ win streak snapped by 3-1 loss in South Bend

Michigan didn’t fall apart until 

the 90th minute.

The 24th-ranked Wolverines 

(4-1-1 Big Ten, 7-4-2 overall) had 
been outplayed prior to that, 
with No. 7 Notre Dame (9-2-1 
ACC, 3-1-1 overall) dominating 

possession and leading 2-1. But 
when Fighting Irish forward 
Jon Gallagher sprinted past the 
defense on a counterattack as 
time wound down, they finally 
folded. Gallagher got all the way 
to Michigan’s 18-yard box before 
he was fouled by Wolverine 
sophomore 
defender 
Abdou 

Samake. Yellow card, penalty 

kick, game, set, match.

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team fell 3-1 in South Bend on 
Tuesday night. This loss snapped 
a two-game win streak and drops 
the Wolverines’ to 3-3-1 in non-
conference games.

Neither team scored until the 

55th minute. Notre Dame strung 
together two light, arching passes 

inside Michigan’s box. Then it 
was forward Jeff Farina who 
slammed it home off a half volley 
to give the Fighting Irish a lead.

The 
Wolverines 
managed 

to tie the game 10 minutes 
later. Sophomore forward Jack 
Hallahan skittered in a cross 
from the right side and junior 
midfielder Robbie Mertz flew in 
unmarked for the finish. For a 
fleeting moment, Michigan had 
momentum. It didn’t last long 
enough.

Notre Dame took the lead for 

good in the 81st minute. Farina 
found Gallagher with a pass that 
cut through Michigan’s defense. 
Despite 
a 
tough 
angle, 
the 

senior forward’s shot flew past 
Wolverine sophomore goalkeeper 
Andrew Verdi and into the back 
of the net.

Michigan’s best chance to 

equalize came with two minutes 
to go. The ball came free in the 
box off a Wolverine corner and 
fell to junior defender Peter 

Brown. For a brief second, 
there was space for a shot. But a 
Fighting Irish defender stepped 
in front before Brown could 
take 
advantage. 
Then 
came 

Gallagher’s 
final knife to the 
heart.

Early in the 

game, Michigan 
had its chances. 
However, 
the 

Wolverines 
couldn’t 
do 

much 
with 

them. 
Junior 

forward Francis 
Atuahene 
accounted for their’ best chance 
in the 31st minute, cutting to the 
middle from outside the box and 
uncorking a missile. It flew wide 
left. As the game wore on, the 
absence of junior midfielder Ivo 
Cerda, out due to a suspension, 
was felt.

“We missed him for energy 

within the team, to keep the game 

lively. We were very very good 
in the first half,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “As the second 
half wore on, we got a little bit 
tired and would have been good 

to have another 
experienced 
player.”

Though 
the 

Wolverines had 12 
shots on the game 
to Notre Dame’s 
11, just three were 
on goal. One was 
Mertz’s 
goal, 

while 
the 
other 

two 
were 
from 

freshman forward 

Mahammed 
Zakyi 
early 
on. 

Those were easily saved by the 
Fighting Irish’s Chris Hubbard.

“Soccer’s made up of maybe 

four of five moments (per game),” 
Daley said. “They had four or five 
moments in the whole game and 
they scored on three of them. We 
had four big moments in the game 
and we scored on one of them.”

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Junior midfielder Robbie Mertz scored the Wolverines’ sole goal in a 3-1 loss to Notre Dame on Tuesday night.

Beilein believes Matthews, grit could be key for defense

For 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team, good cannot be 
the enemy of great.

“We won’t be great,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
of his team’s defense while 
addressing the media last week. 
That came mere seconds after 
saying this might be one of 
his best defensive teams in his 
Michigan tenure.

It’s a dynamic the veteran 

coach has had to deal with for 
much of his career — matching 
his offensive wizardry with 
defensive 
competence.

Nobody 

expects 
the 

Beilein-led 
Wolverines 
to turn into a 
defensively-
anchored 
team. 
They 

won’t suddenly 
become 
Virginia, a team 
that allowed the 
fewest 
points 

per 
game 
in 

the country in 
2016, and does so annually in 
arguably the best conference in 
the country. But based on the 
early practices and offseason 
workouts, Beilein has expressed 
optimism 
about 
his 
team’s 

defense and the personnel that 
they have to deploy on that end 
of the court.

When asked whether he thinks 

this defense could be one of his 
best, Beilein did not hesitate. “I 
do,” he said. “It comes down to 
the players.”

The most important piece 

to that puzzle? Redshirt junior 
guard Charles Matthews.

Matthews, a transfer from 

Kentucky who averaged just 
under two points per game in his 
lone season with the Wildcats, 
comes into the year looking to 
prove the talent that landed 

him in Lexington in the first 
place. But while Matthews may 
be eager to shine offensively, 
Beilein believes his best weapon 
may well be his defensive ability.

“Right now, I think his defense 

is the one (thing) that will be the 
biggest positive addition to the 
team,” Beilein said. “Whether 
it’s deflecting balls, blocking 
shots, running through passing 
lanes, seeing the defense — he’s 
very bright.

“I do think that his quickness 

and athleticism we’ve rarely 
seen here.”

To some extent, this is still 

a guessing game. Losing D.J. 

Wilson 
— 
and 

his team-high 57 
blocks — will hurt 
in the frontcourt. 
Adding Matthews 
and 
freshman 

Isiaah 
Livers 

to 
the 
equation 

theoretically 
brings 
coveted 

defensive 
versatility.

But 
team 

defense in college 
basketball so rarely 
equals the sum of 
its parts. Instead, 

less tangible factors like cohesion 
and rotational ability ultimately 
dictate success. Especially given 
the stark roster turnover on 
this year’s team, it will be hard 
to decipher just how strong of 
a team this is defensively until 
well into the season. But Beilein 
feels strongly that the team-wide 
demeanor is there.

“This is the most competitive 

our practices have ever been 
since I’ve been here,” Beilein 
said. “Because there’s enough 
grit. 
We’ve 
had 
quickness, 

we’ve had talent, sometimes 
we’re missing some of that grit 
to compete. We’ve got some 
competition going on right now 
that’s really healthy for us.”

Last year’s struggles early on 

were often chalked up to a lack 
of that toughness, as has been 

the main criticism of many of 
Beilein’s teams in the past.

So if history is any indication, 

Beilein is right: They won’t be 
great. But he thinks they have 
the athletes and the demeanor 
to be good, or at least defensively 
adequate.

And as history also shows, 

that’s all a Beilein-led team 
needs.

Since he took over the program 

in 2007, Michigan has never had 
a scoring defense ranked higher 
than 33rd nationally. Yet there 
is an undeniable correlation 
between his teams that rank 
adequately defensively (55th or 
better) to a successful season, 
with one notable exception. 

In his ten seasons at Michigan, 

Beilein has had five teams with 
scoring defenses better than 
55th and five teams rank worse. 

In the five seasons better than 
55th, Michigan has won nearly 
65 percent of its games, won 
two regular season Big Ten 
championships and a Big Ten 
Tournament championship. In 
contrast, in the 
five 
seasons 

with a scoring 
defense 
worse 

than 
that 

benchmark, the 
Wolverines won 
just 58 percent 
of their games 
and failed to win 
either a Big Ten 
regular 
season 

or Tournament 
championship. The latter group 
also includes the aberrational 
2012-13 
national 
runner-up, 

which featured five future first-
round picks — a luxury this team 

does not have.

Of course, everything smells 

like 
roses 
two 
weeks 
into 

practice. While attention stays 
on football, fond memories of last 
year’s magical tournament run 

linger. But there 
are 
still 
plenty 

of valid reasons 
for 
skepticism 

about Michigan’s 
defensive abilities. 

Primarily, 

if 
the 
season 

started tomorrow, 
sophomore Moritz 
Wagner 
and 

fifth-year 
senior 

Duncan Robinson 

would likely be the starting 
frontcourt. Wagner, who pulled 
out of the NBA Draft at least in 
part due to questions about his 
defensive and rebounding ability, 

will need to improve upon those 
areas — in addition to rampant 
foul issues — not only for his own 
draft stock, but for his team’s 
defensive formidability in the 
low post. Robinson, for all his 
offensive merits, lacks the foot 
speed to deal with more athletic 
wings and, by Beilein’s own 
admission, “will probably never 
go to the backboard.”

In terms of cohesion, the 

starting unit will feature two 
transfers taking the floor as 
Wolverines for the first time.

But if Beilein’s optimism is 

founded, and the defensive unit 
turns out to be one of his best, 
that bodes well for this team.

It might not be the country’s 

best, but the Wolverines won’t 
need it to be.

For Beilein and Michigan, 

good might as well be great.

Michigan coach John Beilein was quick to praise Charles Matthews for his defensive ability, citing his play as a factor that could serve Michigan’s defense well.

Extra practice time a plus for Wolverines

There’s a common phrase 

often heard around the Michigan 
hockey team’s practices. 

“When the time to perform 

has arrived,” says coach Mel 
Pearson, “the time to prepare is 
long gone.”

Following a split in their first 

regular season contests — a 3-1 
win Friday against St. Lawrence 
and 3-0 loss Saturday at Clarkson 
— the Wolverines are looking to 
take full advantage of fall break 
and a bye week to prepare for 
their first home series next 
weekend against Vermont.

“I’m really looking forward 

to this week and next week,” 
Pearson said. “We get nine 
quality practice opportunities 
and it’s a ‘get-better week.’ We 
have to approach each and every 
opportunity to get better, and 
we will.”

During 
the 
preseason, 

coaches were allowed just two 
hours weekly to lead practice, 
leaving players to finish drills 

on their own — which Pearson 
believes may have contributed 
to a “drop-off” in speed and 
concentration near the tail end 
of practices. Before its trip to 
upstate New York, Michigan 
had 
merely 
four 
standard 

practices.

But with the regular season 

now underway, coaches have 
begun 
running 
practices 

for up to 20 hours weekly, a 
valuable teaching and learning 
opportunity for the new staff.

“You can do a lot more 

coaching, 
which 
is 
nice,” 

Pearson said. “You can take 
your time in doing drills. You 
don’t have to just rush, rush, 
rush. Now you have a little bit 
more time. If you need to slow 
it down, you can. We want 
high-tempo practices, but at the 
same time, we can stop drills 
and correct them. I felt that in 
two hours it was hard to do that 
because you have to go right 
to the next drill because of the 
limited time.

“I think the players really feel 

good about that too. They want 

to be coached. They want to play 
at a high level and a high pace all 
the time. As much as you think 
they can do that on their own, 
they still need that leadership 
or that direction, so now we’ve 
been able to provide that, which 
is good.”

A blended team of newcomers 

and veterans, the Wolverines 
are still grasping new systems 
under Pearson. In his first three 
games — including the 10-1 
exhibition victory Sep. 30 over 
Western Ontario — Michigan 
experimented 
with 
new 

formations in game speed.

The next nine practices will 

focus on further developing and 
executing those schemes.

“A lot of it is new and a lot 

of it will be a little bit to adjust 
to,” said sophomore forward 
Will Lockwood. “But I think it’s 
going to help us in the long run 
for sure.

“(The coaches) give us all the 

tools to succeed on the ice and in 
the games. And now it’s up to us 
to prepare and to be ready going 
into the weekend.”

Pearson is confident his team, 

specifically the freshmen, will 
start to grow into a routine 
of efficiently preparing each 
week for upcoming series. After 
focusing mainly on defense one 
week to puck protection and 
penalty killing the next, the 
Wolverines will have ample 
time to assess and enhance 
many aspects of their game — 
especially the power play, after 
a disappointing 0-for-8 showing 
against 
Clarkson 
— 
before 

hosting the Catamounts.

“Well, we’re going to have 

to continue working on our 
special 
teams, 
especially 

five-on-threes,” 
Pearson 

said. “We haven’t had a lot 
of opportunities to work on 
those … but those are huge 
momentum swings in the game, 
and if we can score one on that, 
then we’re right back in.”

So, when it’s time to perform 

and win games and the time to 
prepare is indeed long gone, 
Pearson hopes his motivational 
maxim will resonate with his 
team.

MEN’S GOLF
Mueller sets record 
as Michigan falters

For 
most 
University 
of 

Michigan 
students, 
Monday 

afternoons are typically filled 
with monotonous lectures, shots 
of espresso and mountains of 
homework.

But for senior Kyle Mueller, 

Mondays are for rewriting the 
record books. This past Monday, 
he did just that, shooting an 
incredible 63 (-7) on day one 
of the Jerry Pate National 
Intercollegiate.

The feat was accomplished in 

the second round of the event, 
as Mueller made a total of eight 
birdies to finish the round seven 
below par. Mueller finished 
the first day of the event as 
the second-best golfer, sitting 
only one shot behind Arkansas’ 
Mason Overstreet.

Mueller’s final round was 

not his best, as he shot a 72 
and fell to fifth overall for the 
event. However, it was Mueller’s 
second round that was the 
highlight, as he tied UNLV’s 
Shintaro Ban for the best round 
in the entire event at 63 strokes.

Mueller is no stranger to 

the course as he played in last 
year’s Jerry Pate Intercollegiate 
and shot a 211 — good for a 
13th-place finish. Playing at the 
Old Overton Club (Par 70, 7,204 
yards), Mueller shot a 203 this 
year, beating his previous score 
by eight strokes.

“(Mueller) is the best player in 

the history of our program,” said 
Michigan coach Chris Whitten. 
“The guys get to see that and 
see the way that he goes about 
practicing and handling himself 
in the tournaments — and even 
without the golf he’s a fantastic 
team leader. He’s everything a 
coach could ask for.”

Despite 
Mueller’s 
valiant 

effort and demeanor, the rest 
of the Wolverines struggled on 
the course. Michigan finished 
11th out of 12 teams in the event, 
and it was truly a mixed bag 

of results as season bests and 
season worsts were had across 
the team.

“It was a mix of two different 

sides of the team,” Whitten 
said. “On the one hand, we had 
Kyle Mueller who played so 
well — and then we had some 
good rounds from the other 
guys, but to count scores in the 
mid-to-high seventies on that 
course was tough and just put us 
behind.”

Michigan’s 
second 
man, 

junior Nick Carlson, finished 
the day ranked 35th after rounds 
of 74 and 73, and hit a 68 in the 
third round.

“For some of the guys, I think 

that they overall hit the ball 
really nicely,” Whitten said. 
“And around the greens is what 
needs to get cleaned up this 
week — and for some other guys 
I think we have some decision-
making things to talk about.”

Speaking to the difficulty 

of playing on a new course, 
Michigan’s top three golfers — 
Mueller, Carlson, and sophomore 
Brent Ito — had all played at the 
same event last year. The two 
newcomers, freshman Henry 
Spring and senior Ian Kim 
fought to find their bearings 
on the new terrain. Spring and 
Kim could have faced even 
less exposure to the course, as 
the Sunday afternoon practice 
round was almost derailed by 
Tropical Storm Nate. 

“The comfort level of having 

played the course before, it helps 
for sure,” Whitten said. “You 
know, that’s what happens with 
new players and we just gotta 
learn from it and get better.”

Michigan will use its two 

weeks off from competition 
seeking to rebound on another 
familiar course in Dallas. The 
Wolverines will play at the Royal 
Oaks Intercollegiate on Oct.-23

“We’re going to a course that 

we’ve played before and know,” 
Whitten said. “So I think we’ll 
get in really good preparation 
before the tournament.”

‘M’ focused on improving run game

The atmosphere inside Al 

Glick Field House on Tuesday 
was noticeably different.

Just ask sophomore running 

back Chris Evans.

“Even the trainers were 

holding the Gatorade (bottles) 
tighter,” he said. “(Harbaugh) 
was yelling, too. It was tough, 
it was intense.”

Still smarting from a 14-10 

loss to Michigan State on 
Saturday night, Michigan set 
out to correct issues in its run 
game. Against the Spartans, 
the Wolverines ran the ball 39 
times for 102 yards, averaging 
just 2.6 yards per carry.

And just as they have all 

season 
long, 
Michigan’s 

offensive 
issues 
were 

compounded by a turnover — 
the first of five on the night.

With just under six minutes 

left in the first quarter, fifth-

year 
senior 
running 
back 

Ty Isaac fumbled the ball as 
his team was driving near 
midfield.

It’s not often that one can 

point to a single play as directly 
changing 
the 
momentum. 

But 
Isaac’s 
lost 
fumble 

certainly gave 
a 
previously 

listless 
Michigan 
State team life.

Before 
the 

fumble, 
the 

Wolverines 
had 
rushed 

13 
times 
for 

58 
yards, 

including 
crucial 
fourth-and 
third-down 
conversions that allowed them 
to control the pace of the game.

After the turnover?
The 
numbers 
aren’t 
so 

pretty there — Michigan ran 

26 times for just 44 yards.

So on Tuesday, practice 

for the skill position players 
included a twist — a longer 
and more intense version of 
their fumble circuit.

As Evans explained, the 

drill involves three stations 

and the running 
backs, 
tight 

ends, 
fullbacks 

and 
receivers. 

Each 
group 

practices picking 
up 
fumbles 

and 
holding 

the ball tightly 
while somebody 
punches 
at 
it. 

Players 
run 
a 

lap if anybody 
fumbles, 
and 

there was even 

a new rule instituted — if a 
player was loosely carrying 
the ball during a “practice 
period,” he would miss the 
rest of the period, which lasts 

around 10 minutes.

“We 
always 
did 
fumble 

circuit, but today there was a 
lot of heat in the air for some 
reason,” 
Evans 
said. 
“The 

coaches were yelling more, 
trying to strip the ball more.”

For Evans — who fumbled 

in Michigan’s 29-13 win over 
Air Force several weeks ago 
— protecting the ball is of the 
utmost importance.

“Ever since I fumbled, I 

haven’t really had it in my left 
hand,” he said. “I just keep 
it in my right … until I feel 
comfortable.”

Of 
course, 
the 
running 

backs are only one component 
of the run game. They can only 
find space if the offensive line 
opens up holes for them. And 
while the line hasn’t been 
doing any new drills, according 
to sophomore left guard Ben 
Bredeson, there has been an 
emphasis on re-establishing 
the rushing attack up front.

“I think (running the ball 

is) definitely an identity of 
Jim Harbaugh’s offense, and 
I think it has been for many 
years,” Bredeson said. “Just 
getting back to our roots. Just 
a lot of physicality this week 
against Indiana.”

Bredeson 
admitted 
that 

sloppiness from the offense has 
“definitely been a theme” so far 
this season. It hadn’t hurt the 
Wolverines in the loss column 
before. But things finally came 
to a boil against Michigan State 
— and now Michigan, whether 
it’s through holding the ball 
tighter or blocking better up 
front, hopes to shore things up.

“We’re 
just 
eliminating 

small mistakes — each one — 
one at a time,” Bredeson said. 
“I feel like everybody’s got 
issues that we have to clean 
up — both individually and 
collectively as an offensive 
unit. 
So 
that’s 
what 
this 

week is for, is we’re cleaning 
everything up and focusing on 
Indiana.”

FOOTBALL
Wolverines preparing 
for up-tempo Hoosiers

The 
Michigan 
football 

defense has to play a “perfect 
game.” 

That is the message defensive 

coordinator Don Brown gave to 
his unit this week.

“As a defense, we’ve been 

doing alright,” said sophomore 
defensive end Rashan Gary. 
“But we got to step it up. As 
you’ve seen, mistakes were 
made.”

Tuesday, 
Gary 
said 
that 

Brown 
emphasized 
how 

important it was for the defense 
to stick to its fundamentals — 
running to the ball, playing 
physical, making tackles.

But 
statistically, 
the 

Wolverines’ defense is playing 
far better than “alright,” as 
Gary said.

The 17th-ranked Wolverines 

(1-1 Big Ten, 4-1 overall) boast 
the nation’s best defense in 
yards allowed and have given 
up an average of just 2.8 second-
half points this season.

It’s clearly a better defense 

than its own players are giving 
it credit for, but that is just the 
mindset the Wolverines will 
take to Indiana this weekend.

The defense is not frustrated 

with the offense’s struggles, 
focusing only on what they can 
contribute to the team.

When Gary was asked about 

what he expected to see from 
the Hoosiers, he focused on 
their fast-paced offense.

“A lot of tempo,” Gary said. 

“We’re getting ready for that 
throughout the course of the 
week.”

Added sophomore linebacker 

Khaleke Hudson: “They’ve got 
good, nice, big receivers, so they 
can throw the fade. Ultimately, 
they’re a good team. We’re 
going to treat them as a good 
team.”

The Hoosiers (0-2 Big Ten, 

3-2 overall) have a lot of depth 
at the receiver position — 
an offensive dimension the 
Wolverines have yet to see from 
an opponent.

Having faced Florida’s multi-

quarterback system, Air Force’s 
triple 
option 
and 
Purdue’s 

trick plays, the Wolverines are 
accustomed to preparing for 
new offenses week after week.

Add to that list a spread-style 

system that regularly lines up 
with four or five wide receivers.

“We’re ready for any offense 

that anybody throws at us,” 
Hudson said. “So that’s not 
going to be a challenge, going 
from a two-tight end or three-
tight end set that Michigan State 
was running to a spread offense 
which Indiana runs. That’s not 
going to be a challenge for us.”

Leading the Hoosiers’ offense 

is wide receiver Simmie Cobb 
Jr., who has three touchdown 
catches 
and 
370 
receiving 

yards. Meanwhile, tight end 
Ian Thomas also has three 
touchdowns and has tallied 254 
receiving yards.

Indiana 
has 
split 
time 

between its two quarterbacks, 
Richard Lagow and Peyton 
Ramsey, but it was the latter 
that took all the snaps last 
weekend in the Hoosiers’ win 
over 
Charleston 
Southern. 

Ramsey excelled in his first 
start, completing 78 percent of 
his passes for two touchdowns 
and 321 yards.

Ramsey and Lagow have 

utilized 
all 
their 
receiving 

options, as five different players 
have made touchdown catches.

It’s a given that Michigan’s 

defense will see more passes, 
and if Brown wants them to play 
a “perfect game,” a lot will rely 
on the defensive line pressuring 
Lagow and Ramsey, and even more 
will rely on Michigan’s secondary 
staying disciplined in coverage.

ON EDGE

michigan in color x the statement

mission statement:


I 

walk down to the 
kitchen to find a 
bowl 
of 
walnuts 

sitting 
on 
the 

counter.

“Your dad got them for 

‘health and happiness,’” my 
mom recounts to me.

“Health and happiness,” 

I repeat to myself. It’s a 
simple idea, but in practice it 
seems like a long journey in 
need of consistent upkeep. 
Being “in control” of your 
own happiness is a concept 
many people try to live by, 
but it is not representative 
of the direction of society.

Sometimes, it seems, it 

is better to block out the 
noise.

The competitive nature of 

the University of Michigan 
only 
acts 
as 
a 
barrier 

between students and their 
own self-care. Beginning 
with the motto “Leaders 
and the Best,” students 
try to achieve lofty goals, 
sometimes at the cost of 
their own mental wellness. 
Time 
and 
time 
again, 

student testimonies of their 
campus experiences show 
high levels of stress, but it 
seems that most professors 
and University are slow to 
catch up in making changes.

Not only is this a problem 

because of the everyday 
stressors 
students 
have 

in 
terms 
of 
academics, 

teachers often fail to realize 
that students are affected 
by the various hate crimes 
and public bias incidents 
on campus. After starting 
university, I quickly found 
myself 
questioning 
how 

much I belong on this 
campus, 
and 
having 
to 

create my own spaces where 
I could feel welcomed.

As of last year, Central 

Student 
Government 

created a Mental Health 
Task Force to determine 
the target issues students 
face. Although the task 
force 
is 
working 
on 

changes, 
accessibility 
to 

mental health services is 
often difficult, with CAPS 
waitlists stretching longer 
and longer.

And yet, the question of 

where the stress originates 
from is one that often goes 
overlooked. According to a 

survey done by the Mental 
Health Task Force, “74 
percent feel uncomfortable 
addressing 
their 
mental 

health 
concerns 
with 

faculty.” 
This 
may 
be 

because 
most 
issues 
of 

physical or mental health 
are dealt with on a case 
by case basis, between the 
student and the professor. 
Students are thus at the 
mercy of their professors 
for accommodations. And 
although 
the 
Dean 
of 

Students Office can send a 
letter informing professors 
of a student’s situation, 
professors are not obligated 
to make accommodations.

I only discovered this 

when I was put in the 
situation 
myself, 
after 

being 
hospitalized 
with 

a virus at the end of my 

junior year. When I emailed 
my adviser, she asked if 
I would be withdrawing 
from the semester, as my 
professors did not have 
to accommodate me even 
if I did my work from 
home. Luckily, I was able 
to finish the school year 
from home, but I had to 
make arrangements with 
each of my professors in 
hopes that they would make 
accommodations.

This 
situation 
only 

mirrors 
that 
of 
the 

working world. Mental and 
physical health are often 
put 
on 
the 
backburner, 

despite the benefits of a 
healthy 
workforce. 
And 

for someone about to enter 
the workforce, the list of 
skills that each potential 
employee 
should 
have 

seems only to get longer.

In the past, it seemed as 

though people only needed 
a 
couple 
of 
specialized 

skillsets; 
however, 
now 

employers look for high 
specialization 
in 
many 

more areas. Hundreds of 
articles seek to answer 
what employers are really 
looking for so that students 
ask themselves: “Do I need 
to learn to code?” or “Should 
I learn a third language?”

Students at this university 

are 
often 
much 
more 

qualified than they believe 
themselves to be, and yet 
not many take the time to 
breathe before rushing full 
speed ahead. Almost all my 
friends have, at some point, 
told me they want to switch 
what they are doing or are 
not sure whether something 
will work out.

I see in their eyes the 

same stress that I have gone 
through many times — as if 
I need to have everything in 
my life decided today and 
have not yet learned every 
possibly skill any potential 
employer could ever want 
me to have.

Sometimes I just have to 

remind myself to breathe, 
and 
grab 
handful 
of 

walnuts.

The picture stays in the kid: Ghosts

I

n retrospect, it was a bad 
decision to review “A 
Ghost Story” for the Daily 
this past summer.

But in my defense, how 

was I supposed to know that the film 
— in which a 30- or 40-something 
dies in a car crash and morosely 
yet patiently haunts his widow and 
home, where successive tenants 
cycle through until a developer 
buildings a large tower in its place — 
would be released in theaters when 
my grandmother stopped eating, 
when I learned we would have to 
put our dog down and when my 
family sold our house?

That 
one-two-three 
punch 

wrecked 
me. 
None 
of 
these 

developments were unforeseeable, 
but their combined effect was 
devastating. Each represented a 
peripheral, yet still critical, aspect 
of my youth.

I spent nearly every Sunday for 

a large chunk of my life driving 
down to Chicago to visit my 
grandmother 
in 
her 
Michigan 

Avenue 
condominium. 
When 

Nancy was diagnosed with primary 
progressive aphasia about 2009, 
for which she paid with her ability 
to use language, our visits became 
more frequent, and more important.

We got Wrigley, our Tibetan 

terrier, when I was in preschool, 16 
years ago, and his lifespan defied 
his own health. Once excessively 
fat and lazy, surviving off only 
cookies as my mother relented to 
his incessant begging, he began to 
lose weight a few years ago until his 
ribcage was showing. I called him 
“Noodle” as a joke, but the reality 
wasn’t too far off.

I moved into my house on 

Kingsport Court in the middle 
of the first day of second grade, 
boarding the A bus in the morning 
and returning to a new home on the 
E bus. It was only about a half-mile 
away, if that, but the neighborhood 
felt different. Our neighbors on Ivy 
Lane were social and amiable; the 

folks on Kingsport were quiet and 
private. And yet it was home, behind 
the police station, with a partially 
collapsing wooden fence in the back.

The tertiary elements of my 

childhood — they are perhaps less 
formative 
and 
important 
than 

myself and my immediate family 
— nonetheless felt important, and 
while I might have been able to 
handle the loss of one after the other 
successively over a number of years, 
the combination at once hurt.

I didn’t feel the effects until a 

little later. I flew into Chicago in the 
middle of the summer to attend the 
funeral and, incidentally, help my 
mom move into her new apartment. 
But once back in Washington, 
with most of my friends soon to be 
leaving for a break before school 

started, I felt alone and fell into a 
depressive state.

I watched “A Ghost Story” about 

a month earlier and it bummed me 
out without deeply affecting me. 
Still, I moped around the house, 
eating dinner by myself, refraining 
from speaking, contemplating its 
messages, which may not have 
been as deep as writer-director 
David Lowery had imagined. In 
fact, I still haven’t truly figured it 
out, and I’m starting to think that 
its philosophizing was simply a 
façade.

But whatever I thought at the 

time, “A Ghost Story” returned with 
a vengeance a few weeks after the 
funeral. I pondered the enormity of 
time, the inevitability of death and 
all that I was bound to encounter in 

my forthcoming years. I needed a 
friend, though, and in Washington, 
most of mine had already left. It 
was awful.

I thought back to the film, which 

aside from its critical acclaim 
became notable when it premiered 
because of its five-minute-long, 
uninterrupted scene of Rooney 
Mara, in mourning, eating pie 
through 
tears. 
That 
scene 
is 

incredible not just because of how 
it depicts grief, but because of how 
it seemingly elongates time by 
refraining from editing. The scene 
feels so long, simply because we’re 
used to the fast pace of other films. 
It goes on forever, and yet it’s only 
five minutes.

I felt her pain in those days. My 

appetite disappeared. I lost interest 
in my hobbies. I felt guilt over my 
lack of emotional expression (I 
still haven’t cried over any of these 
events, for which I feel profound 
shame).

I felt like so much had been 

ripped from me.

And that lingered for a while. I 

worried I would spend the rest of 
my life in this emotional purgatory, 
contemplating my own mortality, 
the inevitability of change, of 
moving on without an anchor. I 
would recall that my father is about 
the age when his father died. I 
would remember I still have one 
grandparent left, and spry as she is, 
she is still in her eighties.

But at some point, the depression 

— or whatever it should be called 
— ebbed. Perhaps it’s because I 
returned to school, where the 
demands of work superseded my 
ability to feel remorse over any other 
facet of my life, and that I haven’t 
returned home to see the carnage of 
my parents’ divorce, of our move, of 
the two deaths.

Still, the film hasn’t left me, and 

like its titular ghost, it haunts me on 
occasion and reminds me that some 
other foundation will vanish, too, 
maybe this time without a warning.

On Edge

Students of color combat campus apathy

b y M i C E d i t o r s : Adam Brodnax, Tanya Madhani, Halimat Olaniyan, 

Christian Paneda, Jason Rowland, Ashley Tjhung and Sivanthy Vasanthan
L

SA sophomore Tyrice Grice 
Jr. was eager to kick off foot-
ball season at the Big House, 
ready to get started on his 

classes and to meet up with his friends 
after a summer spent apart. Like any 
other student at the University of Mich-
igan, Grice was looking forward to his 
fall semester. What he didn’t expect was 
to wake up on the second Sunday of the 
school year with a racial slur written on 

his and his roommates’ dorm room door.

Grice’s experience was one in a series 

of hateful acts committed against Black 
students on campus this year. A few 
weeks after Tyrice’s dorm room nam-
etag was vandalized, flyers advocating 
to “Make America White Again” were 
found near Stockwell Residence Hall 
and videos circulated of individuals 
defiling the #BlackLivesMatter slogans 
chalked on the Diag — all a part of the 

emerging large-scale backlash against 
students protesting for racial equality. 
Additionally, discontent rose from the 
University’s lack of official response to 
these incidents — from not finding the 
perpetrators to the consistently low lev-
els of minority enrollment.

The editors of Michigan in Color 

responded to the palpable racial ten-
sion created by the racist incidents over 
the past month through reporting the 
unique stories of Grice, LSA freshman 
Cydney Gardner-Brown and LSA fresh-
man Amen Al-Moamen. While three 
voices cannot fully capture the feelings 
of all students of color on this campus 
and across the University system, their 
testimonies are nonetheless important. 
These three wanted to be heard — not 
only to show support for those strug-
gling, but also to provide insight for stu-
dents unaffected by these heinous acts.

***
“As a former student, I can see that 

students are confused, uncertain, hos-
tile and … overwhelmed and tired,” 
Fiana said.

To her, the racial tension on campus 

is unmistakable, and she was far from 
alone in her assessment.

“I was surprised that this would hap-

pen in the first three weeks,” Gard-
ner-Brown said. “We didn’t even get a 
chance to (un)pack our bags, and we are 
already being attacked. But at the same 
time, why would I be surprised?”

Gardner-Brown had barely settled 

into college life when she was forced to 
confront the unpleasant reality of life on 
this campus as a Black student. For her, 
the tense racial climate that dominated 
her first month at school allowed her to 
connect with her Black peers. But this 
came at the expense of feeling isolated 
from the greater campus community.

All those interviewed emphasized the 

uneasy atmosphere in the classroom, 
in residence halls and even the library. 
What was surprising, however, were 
reports of a campus climate that ebbed 
and flowed between heightened tension 
and relative calm. To many students, 
these seemingly random spikes are per-

haps more damaging to their day-to-day 
lives than a campus that’s constantly on 
edge.

In the past, moments of tension on 

campus have led to increased activism 
and awareness. But when things calm 
down, these movements struggle to be 
heard — a fact most damaging to stu-
dents of color.

“I feel comfortable, but then sud-

denly the campus reminds us that we 
shouldn’t ever be complacent or com-
fortable,” Gardner-Brown said.

Grice echoed this sentiment, empha-

sizing his concern for movements of 
racial equality.

“We don’t want (these movements) to 

back down. We don’t want #BBUM to go 
down.”

In times of heightened racial ten-

sion, these issues are often addressed 
head-on. When these topics leave the 
forefront of our minds, they tend to be 
ignored. His solution: “Fight until we 
know we are secure on this campus.”

Students of color feel the administra-

tion is not providing them with adequate 
support during this turbulent time. Last 
year, Students4Justice sent out a list of 
demands directed at the University’s 
administration, including harsher pen-
alties for oppressive hate speech, a pro-
cess for changing the names of buildings 
named after controversial figures and 
an increase in Black enrollment. These 
demands largely have not come to frui-
tion. Recently, students protested the 
University’s continued lack of progress 
in an effort to rename a building named 
after C.C. Little, a known eugenicist and 
former president of the University. In 
addition, undergraduate Black enroll-
ment is currently under five percent. 

Though Gardner-Brown acknowledg-

es non-Black students are supportive, 
she does not feel content, citing she feels 
a prevalent sense of complacency among 
non-Black students.

“They can walk away and feel like 

nothing is happening,” she said. “The 
community is left to fend for themselves. 
No one else feels attacked. No one else 
feels like it’s their community too.”

Grice also sees a similar trend of 

detachment and responsibility when it 
comes to allyship.

“The campus doesn’t invoke action on 

their own, and they need to be proactive 
in reaching out to me. There is nothing 
here to get done,” he said. “I don’t see any 
white student leaders standing up with 
us. We need leaders to provoke other stu-
dents to build that community.”

To bring sustainable change in the face 

of racism on campus, students want a 
multipronged approach: one that calls for 
a willing administration to listen to the 
pain of students and faculty of color, not 
one that puts this work on the shoulders 
of an individual, marginalized group.

***
Each of the students who spoke 

stressed the need for the administra-
tion to take concrete, tangible actions to 
openly denounce acts of hate and racism 
and support students of color.

“[There is] a big mistrust between 

these communities and the administra-
tion,” Al-Moamen said, explaining that 
this issue is a direct consequence of 
administration inaction.

Grice highlighted the lack of people of 

color, particularly Black people, within 
the administration and Ann Arbor’s local 
government.

“Since it’s primarily white advisers 

who are the ones in power, we need to 
find a way to convince them to help us 
and to speak out on issues.”

There is an urgent need for change at 

both local and community levels. Gard-
ner-Brown pointed out three urgent 
advancements: the need for more safe 
spaces, the need for increased Black stu-

dent enrollment and the 
need for consequences for 
acts of hate and racism. 
She believes these devel-
opments are necessary for 
sustainable and long term 
change on campus.

“It’s about increasing 

diversity in the campus. 
Not something that can 
change within a school 
year. It’s something to 
be incorporated for the 
future.”

From us to you:
College campuses and 

communities across the 
country are grappling with 
debates 
over 
diversity, 

equity, inclusion and safe-
ty. While the past month’s 
incidents have created a 
very specific climate on 
the University’s campus, 
it’s important to remem-
ber that we do not exist in 
a bubble. If an issue affects 
students at the University, 
chances are it also affects 
students 
at 
universities 

across the nation.

All three students noted 

that though racism is not 
strictly a problem in Ann 
Arbor, it is still the job of 
the University to address it 
on campus.

“There’s no sense of comfort,” Al-Moa-

men said. “To enjoy and excel in college, 
you need a sense of comfort without para-
noia. You need to feel comfortable here. 

This is a nationwide problem. Whether 
in college or not, you have to be able to 
feel free to walk down the street and feel 
comfortable.” 

While the Univer-

sity may not be able 
to solve structural 
racism by itself, the 
three believe it is the 
University’s job to 
protect and support 
students of color on 
campus.

Life at the Uni-

versity has always 
been a balancing act. 
Students juggle the 
pressures of school-
work, jobs and their 
social lives. For stu-
dents of color, tense 
climates on campus 
add yet another level 
of stress to their 
daily lives.

Yet, despite the 

hate crimes Black 
students experience, 
they are expected 
to 
push 
through. 

They are expected 
to 
do 
better 
and 

rise above. They are 
expected to believe 
that somehow these 
incidents will work 

themselves out and that tomorrow every-
thing will be better. For many Black stu-
dents, that’s simply not the case.

Black students are left wondering if they 

will ever feel at home. Along with their 
allies, they’re left challenging the Univer-
sity’s administration to enact change.

As for what’s next, only time will tell. 

These blatant acts of racism and threats 
to the emotional and physical well-being 
of students of color at the University must 
stop. As “the Leaders and the Best” we 
should be better than this. We are better 
than this.

Michigan in Color stands in solidarity 

with the Black students, and all students 
of color, affected. We are here for you, and 
we will be your mic.

Mission Statement: Michigan in Color 

is a designated space for and by people of 
color at the University of Michigan, where 
they are encouraged to voice their opinions 
and reconcile their perspectives and lived 
experiences that may be overshadowed by 
dominant narratives on campus.

Michigan in Color is a writing initiative 

meant to foster a more elevated discussion 
on campus about the role that race and eth-
nicity (intersecting with our other identities 
including socioeconomic status, sexual ori-
entation, religious identification, nation of 
origin, ability status, etc.) shape our social

Personal Statement: Trigger warning

Editor’s note: The author 

of 
this 
piece 
remains 

anonymous to protect their 
identity. 
M

onday 
morning. 
I 
sit 

waiting 

with classmates for the 
professor of our literature 
and human rights class 
to arrive. “Did you hear 
about the shooting in Las 
Vegas?” 
someone 
asks. 

I hadn’t. I whip out my 
phone to read about an aged 
man who was an accountant 
and then a murderer before 
he committed suicide. I 
wonder what matters in this 
article. Does it matter to the 
victims and their families 
that this man used to crunch 
numbers at his 9-to-5 or that 
he was 64 years old when he 
ravaged lives and ended his 
own?

Our professor arrives, and 

we begin our discussion of 
a scene in a novel where a 
woman is gang-raped. Her 
father wants to talk to her 
about it, wants her to seek 
justice, wants her to show 
him how broken she is from 
the experience. She doesn’t.

My 
professor 
told 
us 

a few weeks back that 
he 
believes 
in 
trigger 

warnings, so to talk to him 
or email him if we might 
have an issue discussing 
sexual violence or graphic 
violence. 
Sexual 
violence 

is a separate category from 
other 
violence, 
conjures 

up other images and other 
characters. I try not to think 
at all when the topic comes 
up for fear of true images. 
Photographers, 
we 
think 

of ourselves as magicians 
trying to capture fleeting 
moments 
and 
ephemeral 

light. Some moments have 
enough of their own magic 
to stay in the mind. Dark 
magic, Sauran-level shit.

I sent him an unobtrusive, 

professionally polite email.

“Hey, I have a history with 

sexual violence, so I might 

get quiet in discussion if 
we talk about it. Thanks for 
your understanding.” Just 
like that, another person 
who knows an episode of my 
story.

I used to stand in the 

shower for what felt like 

hours, scrubbing my nails 
against my palms, doing 
nothing but feeling the heat 
of the water gnaw at my skin. 
I counted how many people 
knew every time I showered. 
I named them, murmured 
them to myself, lifted my 
fingers like a child to count 
them on my body. I do 
not know why this ritual 
mattered to me. I still don’t 
know.

And now, I am at the 

same table as someone who 
knows this piece of me, 
discussing the meaning of 
a female character’s rape 
— what matters when we 
discuss this? How can I 
abstract a type of violence 
I know so intimately? Am 

I 
imagining 
something 

sympathetic or concerned 
when he looks at me? Can 
he see the chill that crawls 
under my skin when we 
discuss this?

He can’t know that my 

father is a crying man, 
that I told him I was raped 
on a walk in the woods 
together. My dad didn’t 
bother me or push me 
to do anything like the 
character’s father. My dad 

never told me what part 
of him broke or died upon 
hearing the news. I’ve seen 
him cry at Pixar movies 
and 
discussing 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. and when 
we visited the American 
cemetery in Normandy. I 

didn’t see him cry over his 
daughter’s rape. I don’t 
know his sadness just as 
my professor doesn’t know 
my sadness as I sit in that 
brightly lit classroom.

I wish we all carried this 

sadness together, from time 
to time. I wish we vocalized 
it, spat it out in profanities, 
wailed it.

***
My mom visits me on 

a 
weekday. 
We 
drink 

iced lattes together, go 
to Zingerman’s, wince at 
the smell of weed in the 
elevator of the parking 
garage. Her sister comes 
into town for the night so we 
can have dinner together. 
Our outfits always seem 

to match — silver jewelry, 
polished colors, looking as 
if we could all walk into a 
meeting with a business 
casual dress code.

We all drink Diet Coke 

at dinner. We all love the 
sweet potato fries and 
rosemary 
fries 
equally 

(these things we share). 
My 
aunt 
doesn’t 
like 

ketchup; I didn’t know. By 
dessert we’ve devoured the 
topic of my grandmother’s 

current living situation. 
“It’s just sad,” we all say. 
We don’t say that we’re 
sad; I know we are.

“I just think so often 

about how she must have 
been raised, how her life 
must have gone,” I say. 
I perform the error of 
associating her with a 1950s 
housewife from time to 
time, but then immediately 
I recall how an individual, a 
woman with a husband and 
children cannot be a vintage 
trope. I know her complexity 
and 
persistent 
optimism 

after spending afternoons 
planting flowers in her yard 
and taking her out to lunch. 
I know the ways she folds 
her hands and fixes her hair. 
I do not know if she ever 
felt pressured by her life to 
conform or perform.

I think of this as I sit with 

my mother and my aunt, 
my women in blood and 
conversation. I don’t know if 
they know what it feels like 
to be forced to submit or if 
my grandmother ever knew 
such repugnance. I wanted 
someone who knew the 
feelings of what happened to 
me this past week, someone 
who understood how my 
mind could be rattled years 
after a trauma as I sat in that 
safe, inviting classroom.

In this way, I feel quiet. I 

do not ask. I do not answer; 
I do not have answers. We 
asked what justice would 
have been for the character 
in the book, but I cannot 
define what justice would 
have been in my own life or if 
how my Nana lives is justice 
for society’s expectations for 
women or if my aunt or mom 
ever cried to themselves for 
the reasons I do.

Now, I do not need 

to know. I needed this, 
my mom and my aunt 
at the same table with 
me in a quiet restaurant 
on a Wednesday night, 
skimming over the topics 
of our lives and delving 
into them together.

Copy That: Beauty in disorder

I

n fifth-grade art 
class, we learned 
about 
Jackson 

Pollock, 
an 

artist known for abstract 
expressionism. He became 
famous for dripping paint 
onto 
canvases, 
flicking 

and throwing and pouring 
colors all over the place in 
the name of art. Some of my 
classmates were skeptical, 
because, after all, to our 
10-year-old 
selves, 
the 

Pollock replications we’d 
just stained our clothes 
painting 
looked 
eerily 

similar to the famous ones 
in the museums. I, on the 
other hand, was sold. As 
an artistically challenged, 
semi-introverted 
fifth 

grader, I had found an 
uncanny resonance with 
the disorder of Pollock’s 
work. For the first time in 
my life, I felt as though my 
thoughts could be expressed 
on paper.

Here’s the thing: I am not 

an organized person, but I 
am a perfectionist.

The 
paradox 
of 
this 

does not fall upon blind 
eyes. The way I see the 
world 
falls 
somewhere 

between inherent tedium 
and absolute entropy, and 
that is how it’s always been. 
I never intend to be the 
exemplar of disaster, but I 
often am. I fill my calendar 
with plans, flooding my life 
with commitments I can’t 

keep. I stumble into unmade 
beds at night, insistent that, 
this time, I’ll be complacent 
in the morning. I keep my 
car pristine but lose my keys 
religiously. I open a fresh 
notebook with the intention 
of planning and end up with 
pages of scratched words 
and half-baked ideas. I’m 
quick to apologize and slow 
to forgive. I, while well-
meaning, fall victim to my 
inner chaos, time and time 
again.

Growing 
up, 
this 

contradiction lent itself to 
extreme bouts of premature 
writer’s block and, in turn, 
a thorough fear of writing. 
I could not find a way to 
organize my thoughts into 

words, sentences and stories. 
I felt constrained by the way 
I was taught to write — by 
the rules, clear and concise. 
I feared that, much like 
myself, my writing would be 
messy and improper. Most 
of all, I was afraid of being 
misunderstood. Words were 
so meaningful, and, in turn, 
so terrifying.

After years of frustration 

over unfinished sentences, 
unmade beds and late nights 
looking for lost keys, the 
right words or both, I have 
come to accept that we, as 
writers and people, are not 
linear, and we sure as hell 
aren’t perfect.

This 
may 
seem 
odd 

coming from a copy editor. 

I, after all, dedicate hours of 
my week to proofreading and 
correcting 
other 
people’s 

mistakes. The copy editor, 
by definition, is a curator 
of precision. We at the 
copy desk adhere to strict 
grammatical guidelines and 
seek to streamline the news 
we share with the clarity 
and concision that scared me 
so long ago. We are detail-
oriented 
and 
particular, 

and, as a child, I think the 
newsroom of The Michigan 
Daily might have scared 
the crap out of me.

But the truth is, I don’t 

edit for perfection. I don’t 
write simply to organize 
my 
thoughts. 
I 
don’t 

proofread solely to correct 

error 
or 
fact-check 
to 

streamline the world.

I do these things because 

I believe in the value of 
the process; in what we 
learn 
about 
ourselves 

and the world when we 
challenge 
ourselves 
not 

to fear the chaos, but to 
create something out of it, 
whatever that may be.

Years ago I sat with a 

pencil in hand, positive 
that to follow the rules 
was to create something 
meaningful. But now I 
think that meaning can 
derive from the opposite: 
pushing 
against 
the 

rules, throwing paint on 
the canvas and letting it 
become art.

Each part and each piano stands unique in the workshop.

Workshop desks and tables are littered with various tools and parts to alter and restore the pianos.
Each staff member works on a particular aspect of the restoration process.

John Reeder sells pianos in his showroom in Lansing, but he also restores them 
in his expansive workshop behind the showroom. His staff works with power 

tools, precision tools, wood from Europe, refurbished wood 
— all the pieces that 

go into producing or repairing a beautiful instrument. Just as musicians practice 
every day, Reeder Pianos enables musicians by creating instruments of precision 

and visual beauty.

The pianos to be worked on are often exposed. 
A brush sits waiting to be used on a freshly coated 
piano.
