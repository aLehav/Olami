ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

ALICE LIU/Daily

Take Back the Night Ann Arbor holds its 40th anniversary rally and march at the Union Thursday night. 

GOVERNMENT

Protest units students, community members to take a stand against sexual assault

Nicole Denson, the associate 

director 
at 
Wayne 
County 

Sexual 
Assault 
Forensic 

Examiner’s program, inspired 
the audience of Ann Arbor’s 
40th annual Take Back the 
Night rally — a march taking a 
stand against sexual violence — 
with an empowering call. 

“Let’s not make this a sad 

night, let’s make this a happy 
night,” Denson said. “Let’s take 
back the night!”

The 
event, 
hosted 
by 

Michigan 
Takes 
Back 
the 

Night and a team of volunteers, 
aimed to support and empower 
survivors, provide resources, 
and collectively take a stand 
against sexual assault. The 
night began with attendees 
interacting 
with 
different 

organizations tabling at the 
event, such as Women and 
Gender 
in 
Public 
Policy, 

Planned 
Parenthood 
and 

#StandWithTheseGirls. 
All 

the 
while, 
inspiring 
songs 

like Rachel Platten’s “Fight 
Song” played on the speakers, 
culminating in the projection 
of the music video of Kesha’s 
“Praying,” a song of healing, 
hope and forgiveness.

This 
theme 
of 
healing 

was 
emphasized 
in 
singer-

songwriter 
Jena 
Irene 

Asciutto’s 
performances 
as 

well. Asciutto, the 2014 runner-
up of “American Idol,” sang her 

songs 
“Numb,” 
“Innocence” 

and “Unbreakable” between the 
different speeches.

Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor spoke first, 
expressing his support of Take 
Back the Night’s message, as 
well as organizations across 
Ann Arbor combating sexual 
violence. He recognized the 
gravity of this issue and the 
great deal of work which needs 
to be done, but said he remained 
optimistic.

Annual Take Back the Night rally 
calls for end to sexual violence

Last week, the University 

of Michigan Board of Regents 
unanimously voted to remove 
the 
name 
of 
the 
former 

Clarence Cook Little Science 
Building. Since the decision 
late last week, the University 
has taken steps in clearing the 
building’s name from usage. 
Less than one hour after the 
decision was made, the old 
building sign was removed 
and changed to “1100 North 
University Building.” Given 
the short notice, departments 
across campus are continuing 
to remove the name from 
flyers 
and 
other 
campus 

resources.

During 
the 
Regents 

meeting last week, Regent 
Andrea 
Newman, 
R, 

addressed 
the 
University’s 

important role in “changing 
the 
student 
vernacular,” 

claiming members of the U-M 
community 
will 
continue 

to identify the building, as 
well as the Central Campus 
Transit Center, as C.C. Little. 
Students and faculty alike 
are still reflecting on the 
University’s duty in mediating 

how C.C. Little’s name and 
history will be remembered in 
campus culture.

Little, 
the 
University 

president of during the first 
half of the 20th century, 
was a strong supporter of 
the eugenics movement and 
a proponent of the tobacco 

industry. 
Many 
students, 

faculty and administrators 
on campus believe Little’s 
legacy 
does 
not 
deserve 

commemoration and a named 
building.

According 
to 
University 

spokeswoman 
Kim 

Broekhuizen, U-M Logistics, 

Transportation 
& 
Parking 

is working to change the 
bus 
announcements 
that 

currently refer to the Central 
Campus Transit Center as the 
C.C. Little Transit Station.

This year, all three of the 

University of Michigan men’s 
basketball, men’s hockey and 
debate teams have made it to 
their respective Final Four 
tournaments. 
The 
National 

Debate Tournament took place 
last weekend at Wichita State 
University in Kansas, where 
the U-M team eventually lost 
to Georgetown University in 
the semifinals.

Founded 
in 
1890, 
the 

Michigan Debate Team is one 
of the oldest debate programs 
in the country. It has reached 
the semifinals in the National 
Debate Tournament five times 
since 2008. This year’s team, 
consisting 
of 
LSA 
juniors 

Caitlin Walrath and Jacob 
Goldschlag, was led by Director 
of Debate Aaron Kall. Thrilled

At approximately 3:00 p.m. 

Thursday afternoon Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
officers arrested a shirtless 
white male on the northwest 
portion 
of 
the 
University 

of Michigan Diag, between 
Mason Hall and the E.H. Kraus 
Building. Officers from the Ann 
Arbor Police Department were 
also on the scene. 

Engineering freshman Jim 

Walrad witnessed the arrest 
while handing out flyers for the 
Men’s Glee Club Spring Concert.

“(After 
hearing 
noise) 
I 

eventually looked at that section 
of the Diag and saw two police 
vehicles and I saw a man lying 
face down on the ground,” 
Walrad said. “He had pants 
on but no shirt –– looked like 
sweatpants and running shoes

ROSEANNE CHAO/Daily

Democratic gubernatorial 

candidate 
Abdul 
El-Sayed, 

a 
University 
of 
Michigan 

alum, held his final rally of 
the semester in Lorch Hall 
Thursday 
night, 
featuring 

Alex Ebert, the lead singer of 
rock band Edward Sharpe & 
the Magnetic Zeros.

About 
100 
students 

attended 
the 
“Start 
of 

Summer Rally” to launch 
the 
campaign’s 
“People’s 

Summer”, which that focuses 
on mobilizing young people 
to vote in the Democratic 
gubernatorial primary August 
7.

Intended 
to 
draw 

participants from across the 
state, the event was live-
streamed to several other 
universities including Grand 
Valley 
State 
University, 

Central Michigan University, 
Oakland University and more.

El-Sayed graduated from 

the University in 2007 and 
then went on to receive a 
doctorate degree from Oxford 
University 
as 
a 
Rhodes 

Scholar and later a medical 
degree 
from 
Columbia 

University. El-Sayed served 
as health officer for the city 
of Detroit from 2015 to 2016, 
and became youngest health 
official of a major U.S. city 
at age 30 when he served 
as executive director of the 
Detroit Health Department. 
He said he was called to 
public service through his 
experience 
with 
various 

positions in the Detroit area 
as well as his desire to see 
systematic change on a local 
level.

“Every single responsibility 

we took on led to the closed 
door of a politician –– people 
whose doors don’t open for 
people like you and I, that only 
open for the moneyed folks,” 
El-Sayed said. “And I realized 
that I was done waiting at that 
closed door.”

El-Sayed’s platform focuses 

on various issues, ranging 
from gun reform to affordable 
public education and health 
care. At the rally, the campaign 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 

policy change by including 
personal 
testimonies 
from 

Aarica Marsh, a University 
alum who graduated in 2016, 
and 
current 
Skyline 
high 

school senior Aisha Soofi.

Marsh 
focused 
on 
her 

experience coming from a 
lower income household in 
Michigan 
public 
schooling 

and 
as 
a 
first-generation 

college 
student. 
Marsh 

explained she and many of 
her peers came from unstable 
households 
and 
were 
not 

provided the resources to 
graduate high school. Though 
she 
wexpressed 
gratitude 

for 
the 
opportunities 
in 

her life, her problems did 

not end upon coming to the 
University, and her financial 
struggles were a constant 
difficulty 
throughout 
her 

college 
experience. 
Marsh 

expressed her support for 
El-Sayed, having worked on 
his campaign for more than a 
year.

“I know that Abdul is 

incredibly empathetic — he 
actually 
understands 
the 

problems that people like 
me and my family face,” 
Marsh said. “He knows that 
standardized tests don’t often 
measure the successes of our 
schools, but rather where 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged 

families are located”

Soofi focused on El-Sayed’s 

pro-gun control policy, saying 
she, her peers and teachers at 
school should not feel they are 
in danger of gun violence.

“There is only one candidate 

in the state who is saying 
enough 
is 
enough,” 
Soofi 

said. “Only one candidate 
who is standing up against 
the NRA, who is standing for 
reasonable gun reform, and 

who is fighting for an assault 
weapons ban.”

As a younger candidate, 

a Muslim and a person of 
color, El-Sayed said, he is 
disadvantaged 
in 
popular 

discourse and often not taken 
seriously by other politicians. 

He 
added, 
those 
factors 

also play into his strengths, 
principally 
his 
ability 
to 

mobilize 
young 
people 

and 
otherwise 
overlooked 

communities. He asked the 
audience to think about 
the world they want their 
future children to live in, 
alluding to the birth of his 
first child in November.

“When you have a child, 

the set of questions that 
you want to ask about the 
world changes. Because 
the sense of your longevity 
extends beyond your life, 
and you see in another 
human being what it is 
that you want to leave in 
the world,” El-Sayed said. 
“So when you ask yourself 
what you’re working for, 
I hope that you extend 
beyond the arc of what 
you can see right now, 
and ask yourself: What 
will the world have been 
because you decided to get 
up and in 2018, make the 
difference, and make the 
future that you wanted to 
live?”

LSA 
freshman 
Celia 

Frey works as a volunteer 
on the Abdul for Michigan 
campaign and expressed 

her confidence in his track 
record as a public servant 
through his work as health 
officer. She specifically cited 
his partnership with Vision 
To Learn, a program which 
administers free eye exams 
and glasses to elementary 
school students in Detroit.

“I’m 
volunteering 
with 

him 
because 
from 
what 

I’ve seen out of all the 
democratic 
candidates 
in 

the primary, he is really the 
most progressive and the one 
with the most track record 
of actually getting things 
done,” she said. “I think that 
there are other candidates 
that have been less willing 
to really have progressive 
agendas, and be aggressive 
about things like gun laws, 
whereas he has really come 
out in the extreme. I feel 
the most confident in him 
actually being able to get 
those progressive agendas 
accomplished.”

On 
the 
other 
side 
of 

the 
spectrum, 
Republican 

candidate Bill Schuette has 
garnered attention for his 
work as Michigan attorney 
general on issues such as 
anti-bullying 
campaigns 

and 
human 
trafficking. 

In 
a 
previous 
interview, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

lecturer Rusty Hills, director 
of public affairs for Schuette, 
said he believes Schuette’s 
current work as attorney 
general 
prepares 
him 
in 

fields El-Sayed does not have 
experience in.

“I think he’s doing an 

outstanding job as attorney 
general, 
and 
the 
most 

important thing you can do 
for future office is a good 
job in the office you hold,” 
Hills said. “So on a wide 
range of issues, I feel like Bill 
Schuette’s done a great job as 
attorney general. I think that 
will help him in this race for 
governor.”

The event closed with 

an 
interactive 
musical 

performance 
by 
Alex 

Ebert and local Ann Arbor 
musicians.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
Race and Ethnicity is not the forefront purpose of 

the course. Right now, Race and Ethnicity, it’s like the 
second addition, or the add-on. It’s a bonus. You don’t 
take Race and Ethnicity courses with the intention of 
thinking deeply about race and ethnicity. You take it for 
the subject, and it just so happens that it gets qualified as 
being a Race and Ethnicity course.

BEAT LOYOLA CHI puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman Leah 
Graham wrote about the Lecturers’ Employee Organization’s 
decision to authorize a strike.

“One of the interesting things about this is LEO’s current contract 
has a no-strike clause, and there’s also a state law that prohibits 
public employees from striking. And when I asked LEO about this, 
I don’t wanna say that they brushed it aside, but it seemed kind of 
inconsequential in their grand scheme of things. Ian Robinson, the 
president of LEO, he said that three years ago, when they negotiated 
the contract that they’re operating on right now, he tried to get it to 
end sooner, so that way this strike wouldn’t go against that contract, 
but they didn’t get that clause. And he essentially said ‘We’re not 
gonna let a few days from the end of this contract stop us from getting 
a fair contract for the future. For the most part, he talked about the 
teacher strikes in Oklahoma and West Virginia, and he said sometimes 
you have to break laws that are unjust to get something that you think 
is just. So, for the most part he kind of dismissed the importance of 
that law and also the no-strike clause, in terms of getting what he 
thinks is a fair contract for members of LEO.”

LSA freshman Leah Graham, “Lecturers authorize strike pending 
University salary proposal”

“I know 

that Abdul 
is incredibly 
empatheic — 
he actually 

understands the 

problems.”


for the debate team, Kall said 
it was “an honor to follow the 
lead” of the basketball and 
hockey teams.

“We’ve accomplished this 

milestone in four of the last 
five seasons, but remain eager 
to bring home the first debate 
national 
championship 
to 

Ann Arbor next year,” Kall 
said. “Caitlin and Jacob are 
only juniors and will have an 
excellent opportunity to make 
this happen.”

Goldschlag emphasized the 

amount of work he and the 
team put into preparing for the 
debate. He believed the team 
will ride the momentum of this 
season’s overall success into 
next year.

“We have not yet had a 

tournament as successful this 
season,” 
Goldschlag 
wrote 

in 
an 
email 
interview. 
“I 

think ending the season on a 
high note will bring us some 
momentum going into next year 
as we compete for a national 
title. We are excited about the 
possibility of bringing the first 
National Debate Tournament 
championship in the school’s 
history home to Ann Arbor.”

Goldschlag 
said 
being 
a 

member of the debate team has 
been a large part of his time at 

the University.

“The debate team has been 

integral 
to 
my 
Michigan 

experience 
from 
the 
very 

beginning,” he wrote. “The 
only reason I even heard of 
the school, being a southern 
California native, was because 
of the summer debate camp for 
high school students, which I 
attended several times. Since 
I have been here, I’ve made a 
number of lifelong friends on 
the team as well as with college 
students all over the country.”

Walrath 
attributed 
the 

team’s success to three things: 
pre-college 
debate 
summer 

programs, the University’s full-
time coaches, staff and alumni, 
and the hard work and strategy 
of 
their 
team. 
Goldschlag 

agreed with Walrath on the 
reasons the U-M team is so 
competitive in addition to the 
fact they all work toward the 
greater goal of the team rather 
than their individual selves. 
Walrath said she enjoys debate 
because of her teammates.

“My favorite part of debate 

is honestly the people I get to 
be around,” Walrath wrote in 
an email interview. “I also just 
love competing in an academic 
activity 
because 
it 
keeps 

me 
engaged 
with 
politics, 

international relations, etc. as 
well as it definitely helps in the 
academic department.”

Walrath 
described 
the 

National Debate Tournament 

as a surreal experience, saying 
the impact of their national 
ranking did not hit her until 
afterwards.

“It was also weird because I 

was so locked into just winning 
every round that it didn’t really 
hit me that we made semifinals 
of a national tournament until 
after it was all over,” Walrath 

wrote. “I think that is the 
attitude that I want to carry 
into next year though: pure 
focus. I believe if we keep 
our hard work up (both in 
terms of producing research 
and practicing constantly) in 
combination with that focus, 
we will win it all. We have an 
amazing coaching staff and 
group of teammates so the 
sky’s the limit. We are ready to 
finally bring home a national 
championship title.”

“Sexual 
harassment 
and 

assault and violence burdens 
and degrades the lives of 
women 
and 
girls 
every 

day,” Taylor said. “It is the 
expression and instrument of 
male dominance. But it is not 
inevitable. Cultural change, 
even in problems as deep-
seeded as this, can happen. It 
does come slowly, but it can 
happen.”

Keynote speaker Margaret 

Tallet, the COO of Michigan 
Women’s 
Foundation, 

discussed her work as the 
leader of Enough Said, a 
campaign 
to 
remove 
the 

accumulation of untested rape 
kits in Detroit. She said some 
of these kits contained the 
information of women whose 
rapes had occurred as far as 25 
years ago. Tallet highlighted 
the 
immense 
support 
she 

garnered 
from 
community 

members, including DeAndre 
Levy of the Detroit Lions, 
and how the hard work of 
constituents in fundraising 
eventually 
garnerd 
the 

attention of local politicians.

“It’s been grassroots,” Tallet 

said. “It’s been people like you 
who create a difference.”

Tallet was proud to report 

the last of the untested rape 

kits in Detroit were mailed 
to a lab two weeks ago. She 
again 
acknowledged 
the 

community’s efforts and urged 
the ralliers to come together 
in the chant, “Enough said!”

“It truly is an act of an 

entire community of people 
who care and because this is 
a rally, I want to end with all 
of you saying enough said,” 

Tallet said.

The organizers also brought 

the ralliers together through 
activities 
like 
the 
men’s 

pledge, when all the men at 
the rally walked to the stage to 
sign a commitment to work to 

fight sexual violence. Student 
speakers 
also 
provided 

information on SafeHouse and 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 
as 

resources for survivors of 
sexual violence.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Alex Backus said he attended 
Take 
Back 
the 
Night 
to 

support the organization and 
empower 
other 
survivors, 

being a survivor himself. He 
also applauded the event’s 
ability to raise awareness and 
make change.

“I think these kinds of 

events open people’s eyes,” 
Backus said. “A lot of people 
don’t realize that things like 
this happen all the time. So, 
I think these events make 
people aware and make people 
understand that we need to 
change things.”

Before the ralliers went 

off to march the streets of 
Ann Arbor, Denson and other 
organizers read their list of 
demands 
detailing 
action, 

they believe, must be taken 
to end sexual violence. Each 
demand was punctuated by 
attendees 
stomping 
their 

feet or cheering. The last 
one, promising to continue 
their activism to end sexual 
violence after the event, ended 
with an eruption of applause.

–– and the police were standing 
around him, and I didn’t notice 
any (handcuffs). I turned back 
and the guy was sitting upright 
on the ground, sitting pretzel-
style, then I looked away again 
and the next time I looked there 
was one police vehicle there.”

A member of the Mason Hall 

custodial staff said he heard 
the man was roaming with a 
large pole hitting cars and other 
objects before being taken into 
custody. He said the man seemed 
mentally unstable, as if he were 
“on drugs or something of that 
nature.”

Melissa Overton, University 

deputy chief of police, said 
officers 
took 
the 
individual 

into “protective custody” and 
the situation was a medical 
emergency, but could not give any 
further information.

“He took off and ... ran on 

foot and there was a short foot 

pursuit and he was yelling and 
screaming,” Overton said. “He 
did comply with our officer’s 
orders when we asked him to stop 
and get on the ground. He was 
being disruptive.”

A 
woman 
on 
the 
scene 

identified herself to DPSS officers 
as the individual’s mother, and 

two men approached the woman 
and DPSS officers, identifying 
themselves as fraternity brothers 
of the arrested individual.

transportation 
service, 

incorrectly referring to the 
Central Campus Transit Center 
as “C.C. Little.” Broekhuizen 
said the announcement “was 
written and teed up before 
the vote on Thursday” and the 
department promptly made the 
correction on their website.

“Our 
assessment 
after 

consulting 
with 
Student 

Life is that there isn’t much 
ongoing concern on this topic,” 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email.

Prior 
to 
the 
President’s 

Advisory 
Committee 

on 
University 
History’s 

investigation 
into 
the 

historical significance of C.C. 
Little’s name, students and 
faculty 
submitted 
official 

requests and staged protests 
in support of removing the 
name. Broekhuizen said the 
University hosted town hall 
meetings for students to learn 
about renaming the building, 
provided public information 
and 
released 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

committee reports.

While the University claims 

progress has been made to 
remove C.C Little’s name in 
public areas across campus, 
many students and faculty ask 
what the University’s role is 
in reflecting how C.C. Little’s 
name is remembered.

LSA senior Madison Jones has 

dedicated time to advocating 
for the removal of C.C. Little’s 
name, 
participating 
in 
the 

protest during the LSA Student 
Government 
meeting 
last 

September. Though her initial 
goal has been accomplished, 
Jones said there is still much 
to learn. Jones believes the 
University has the power to 
influence 
U-M 
culture 
by 

continuing to educate students 
on the importance of the name 
removal.

“I think if they were more 

heavy-handed and a little bit 
stronger in their responses, 
that would help,” she said. “If 
they actually came out and 
had denounced the things C.C. 
Little did and framed it as, ‘We 
really understand why this 
building name is unacceptable, 
and that’s why we are changing 
it,’ rather than framing it as 
some sort of intellectual debate, 
I think that would help with 
more people and more students 
understanding, ‘Oh this isn’t an 
okay thing.’”

Jones also expressed her 

concern on the University’s 
delayed response.

“With any of these incidents 

and any of these problems, the 
University’s response is always 
not only too slow, but too kind 
of calm, too kind of attached, 
too kind of disregarding and 
invalidating 
the 
sense 
of 

urgency and the feelings these 
students have,” she said.

As a senior, Jones empathizes 

with student activists who are 
not able to witness the fruits of 
their labor.

“Everything people are doing 

on this campus is to better it 
for future generations,” Jones 
said. “But still, people want 
to see tangible results to their 
organizing and activism within 
their own student cycle.”

An LSA sophomore, who 

requested to remain anonymous 
due to his involvement in CSG, 
said he didn’t think changing 

the name of the building was 
going to make a measurable 
difference on campus because 
the University is not addressing 
the lingering cultural impact of 
C.C. Little’s name.

“I really don’t think there’s a 

purpose in changing it, in that 
it doesn’t erase the fact that 
the person who it was named 
after was racist,” the student 
said. “Just because you change 
a name of a building, that 
doesn’t change the culture of 
the University.”

In an email interview, Angela 

Dillard, the associate dean 
for Undergraduate Education, 
echoed the student’s sentiments 
and said simply removing the 
name does not change history 
books or the cultural impact C. 
C. Little had on campus.

“Removing 
CC 
Little’s 

name from the building does 
not erase him from history,” 
Dillard wrote. “He was (still) 
president of the UM from 1925 
to 1929; there has been no 
move to expunge him from the 
history books -- even if such 
a thing were even possible … 
Names change all the time for 
various reasons.”

Peter McIsaac, an associate 

professor 
of 
German 
and 

museum 
studies, 
said 
he 

believes the University has 
a 
great 
responsibility 
in 

influencing how members of 
the community will remember 
C.C. Little.

“I think it’s too simple to 

think, ‘We take the name down, 
this means we’re free and clear. 
We never had people like that 
on our faculty, we never had a 
President who was a eugenist,’” 
McIsaac said. “(Little’s) not the 
only one. So I think it’s a good 
thing to take the name off the 
building, but I think it’s too 

simple to say, ‘Oh, that solves 
the issue.’”

McIsaac suggested ways in 

which the University could 
provide a learning opportunity 
from the recent decision, from 
introducing 
the 
building’s 

history on campus to new 
students 
during 
orientation 

to an installation that could 
be placed near the building, 
explaining its history and why 
the name was changed.

McIsaac 
also 
said 
he 

recognized the name removal 
as an opportunity to reflect 
on the University’s past and 
how the University can move 
forward.

“Rather than simply saying, 

‘Okay we want to manage 
consciousness by saying, “Don’t 
call it that anymore,”’ there’s 
sort of a moment to learn,” 
McIsaac said.

Terrence 
McDonald, 
a 

history professor and chair 
of the President’s Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

History, spoke at last week’s 
meeting prior to the vote 
to present the Committee’s 
findings 
about 
Little. 
The 

Committee debated the issue 
for 
months 
and 
officially 

submitted 
the 
request 
for 

Schlissel to recommend the 
building’s renaming in January. 
McDonald said he encourages 
community 
members 
to 

celebrate 
the 
University’s 

decision.

“I think it’s important to 

point out that the University 
has done something significant 
already,” he said. “By saying 
to the community and to the 
world that we are not going 
to commemorate people who 
were involved in this national 
movement. The decision can 
feel kind of routine, but it 

wasn’t. It actually was quite 
remarkable that the regents 
decided 
to 
vote 
and 
that 

Schlissel decided to accept the 
recommendation.”

In an interview with The 

Daily 
last 
week, 
Schlissel 

reiterated 
McDonald’s 

comments on the rarity of 
the decision, saying he didn’t 
“want the names of things to be 
changing as fashions change.”

According to McDonald, the 

Committee found Little was 
an immigration restrictionist 
during 
his 
time, 
and 
was 

in favor of restrictions that 
would be complementary to 
today’s rhetoric from President 
Donald Trump against illegal 
immigration 
from 
Latin 

America.

“I don’t know how many 

people realize that we are 
repeating some of the same 
themes and that those themes 
were 
repudiated,” 
he 
said. 

“People at the time in the 
’20s were saying, ‘This is not 
the right way to think about 
immigrants.’ And yet we’re 
repeating some of the same 
things.”

McDonald said the original 

naming decision was made 
without 
much 
thought 
or 

consideration, following a basic 
argument that there should be 
a building named after every 
president. McDonald believes 
the recent change will create 
exciting and novel conversation 
about how the University wants 
to think about a building that 
has yet to be renamed.

“One of the opportunities for 

us, pedagogically, is to think 
about what we can learn about 
the conversation from the ’20s 
that Little lead,” McDonald 
said. “He was actually the 
leader of this organization, 

and what’s the role of that 
conversation today and why are 
we revisiting these themes in 
contemporary America.”

In the wake of the regents’ 

decision, McDonald said several 
University classes are already 
including 
this 
conversation 

in their material. Next year, 
McDonald 
believes 
science 

courses, as well as those on 
American history, have much 
to gain from paying attention 
to C.C. Little, his problematic 
history and how the University 
is moving forward.

As professors who study 

the past, both McDonald and 
McIsaac said they value the 
importance of learning from 
history to avoid repeating it 
again.

However, Jones commented 

on the current conversations 
around Little’s name and its 
usage on campus, saying those 
who continue to use Little’s 
name on campus to signify 
spaces such as the Transit 
Center is a constant reminder 
to students of color who were 
directly persecuted by Little’s 
ideals. She also said history 
cannot be ignored and the 
University should do more to 
denounce Little’s ideals and 
influence 
Little’s 
continued 

cultural identity on campus 
past a name change.

“C.C. Little, because he’s 

this historical figure, we can’t 
see him, we can’t talk to him 
right now. It’s easy to just be 
desensitized to that history 
and think it doesn’t matter,” 
Jones said. “You can’t ignore 
that history and it’s no longer 
sanitized.”

Victory Royale for Esports

BEN CHARLSON | COLUMN

JOEL DANILEWITZ | COLUMN

D

rake recently rose to 
the top of the Billboard 
Hot 
100 
with 
his 

latest hit, “God’s Plan,” and 
its heartwarming music video 
in which the rapper gives out 
nearly $1 million (the budget for 
the video shoot) in the form of 
groceries, gifts and donations 
to lucky recipients across the 
Miami area.

But the Grammy-nominated 

artist has stayed in the news 
not only for his music, but 
for 
another 
endeavor 
that 

has captured the attention of 
celebrities, athletes and college 
students 
alike 
— 
“Fortnite 

Battle Royale, “ the video game 
that is sweeping the nation and 
only gaining more momentum.

“Fortnite,” as both a pop 

culture 
phenomenon 
and 
a 

revenue-generating 
stream, 

seemingly came out of nowhere 
in the past six months. But a 
closer read reveals “Fortnite” is 
just one of the many games that 
make up the booming eSports 
industry, a market that has been 
steadily growing and grasping 
more and more opportunities 
for 
mainstream 
sponsorship 

and advertising deals.

eSports are defined as any 

multiplayer video game played 
competitively, oftentimes for 
spectators both live in arenas 
and via the internet. These 
games are beginning to take 
the classic form of traditional 
sports — a series of competitions 
that accumulate points for the 
players, ending with a final 
tournament hosted in a national 
stadium or streamed live on TV. 
With viewership of professional 
sports like the NFL dwindling, 
it might be time to consider 
eSports a real threat to the 
status quo in American media.

On March 15, Drake, fellow 

rapper 
Travis 
Scott, 
NFL 

superstar JuJu Smith-Schuster 
and 
“Fortnite” 
guru 
Tyler 

“Ninja” Blevins came together to 
play a few hours of the popular 
game in what quickly became 
the 
most 
watched 
Twitch 

stream of all time, gaining 
over 
600,000 
simultaneous 

viewers at its peak. Twitch is a 
live viewing platform that was 
acquired by Amazon for close to 
$1 billion in 2014.

Blevins, who is slowly but 

surely becoming the Michael 
Jordan of “Fortnite”, claims he 
makes more than $500,000 per 

month from YouTube subscribers 
and Twitch streamers.

His expected annual salary, 

which would amount to about 
$6 million, is greater than 
those of NFL and MLB players. 
Though such success from a 
man who sits in his basement 
and wears pajamas may seem 
shocking, the eSports following 
is nothing new.

In 2017, the global eSports 

industry was valued at $493 
million, 
with 
some 
sources 

projecting market revenue to 
reach $1.65 billion by 2020. 
Originally 
a 
phenomenon 

originating in Asia and gaining 
the most viewership in China 
and South Korea, the industry is 
transitioning to the United States 
through games like “League of 
Legends” and “Fortnite.” 

What makes the eSports 

industry such a captivating 
market is its ability to take 
video games — ideally played 
on a couch with a bag of 
chips and soft drink — to an 
arena suited for basketball 
or hockey. In fact, the 2017 
“League of Legends” World 
Championship 
was 
played 

in Beijing National Stadium, 
otherwise 
known 
as 
the 

Bird’s Nest, or the same place 
that held the 2008 Summer 
Olympics opening ceremonies. 
That 
same 
event 
in 
2016 

garnered 400 million viewers, 
whereas the 2018 Super Bowl 
saw only a little more than 100 
million tune in. Other eSports 
statistics 
are 
even 
more 

shocking: 100 million “League 
of Legends” players per month, 
600 sponsorship deals with 
companies like Red Bull and 
Coca Cola and 2.7 billion 
videos streamed last year in 
North America.

The facts don’t lie. eSports 

are tapping into global markets 
in 
ways 
traditional 
sports 

cannot, 
and 
it 
is 
finding 

innovative methods to grow 
its revenue and sponsorship 
streams around the world. 
The newest development is a 
proposal to build an eSports 
arena in a Las Vegas casino, 
a move that would completely 
transform the landscape of 
gaming culture in the United 
States.

It 
helps, 
too, 
that 
the 

NFL has faced controversies 
over 
player 
protests 
and 

concussions that have altered 
the landscape of the league 
and slashed viewership to a 
recent low.

These factors together have 

converged on the newest craze, 
“Fortnite,” and aided its rise 
to popularity. Though there is 
no way to tell whether or not 
it is just a phase, the status 
of “Fortnite” in pop culture 
is such that a wide array of 
stars have hopped onto the 
bandwagon 
— 
rapper 
Lil 

Yachty, NBA all-star Gordon 
Hayward and Boston Red Sox 
phenom 
Xander 
Bogaerts, 

to name a few in addition to 
the star-studded, “Ninja”-led 
squad mentioned before.

Unsurprisingly, the game 

has 
found 
a 
home 
across 

university campuses and high 
schools as well. It is practically 
everywhere — a walk through 
any college dorm will reveal a 
slew of students glued to their 
TVs, 
more 
concerned 
with 

finding a chest or rare gun than 
completing 
their 
homework. 

Recently, 
“Fortnite” 
had 
to 

launch an update on its mobile 
version in which the loading 
screen reminds the user to stop 
playing in class.

All of this is to reinforce 

the idea that eSports are much 
more 
than 
the 
traditional 

video 
game 
our 
parents 

think turn us into lifeless, 
computer-addicted 
zombies. 

Games like “Fortnite” are 
a 
revenue-generating, 
pop 

culture phenomenon that will 
soon be the next mainstay on 
ESPN or Fox Sports.

Until then, we can sit 

back, turn on the Xbox and 
play “Battle Royale” until our 
thumbs start to cramp. And if 
we’re lucky, maybe Drake will 
be online to play a round of 
Duos.

The reality of privilege

O

ver 
the 
summer, 
I 

interned at a health care 
lobby in Washington, 

D.C. Or at least, that’s what I 
tell people. In reality, I worked 
for 
the 
government 
affairs 

office of my dad’s company. My 
mom always says that the door 
of opportunity is open, I just 
have to walk through it. This 
was how I continually justified 
taking this internship at his 
office – pretending like walking 
through that particular door was 
so difficult.

I 
sometimes 
take 

embarrassment in the fact that 
I interned at my dad’s company 
because I know I probably took 
the position from someone who 
was actually dedicated to the 
cause with which I was affiliated 
but of which I knew so little 
about. Someone who also had the 
skills and experiences to do this 
type of work.

During this experience, I 

began to think, “Do talent, life 
skills or merit really matter?” 
If you’re privileged, no. I am 
constantly trying to grasp the 
concept of privilege, especially 
considering 
how 
I 
am 
in 

possession of a disproportionate 
amount when compared to the 
rest of the world.

At 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, the median yearly 
of income students’ families is 
$154,000. The median income of 
the average American is $50,039 
I, like so many others, was and 
continue to be blithely unaware 
of such disparities. But as I 
become more and more aware of 
how little I’ll have to think or do 
to gain economic success, I want 
more and more to understand 
what it means to have to 
persevere and gain success.

From a racial standpoint, 

I understood that being white 
endowed me with an inordinate 
amount of opportunity that is 
simply not relegated to people 
of color. As a cisgender man, I 
try to be acutely aware of how 
much easier it is to carry out tasks 
and daily excursions that most 
cisgender women find difficult. It 
could be the incontrovertible fact 
that I’ll never feel the need to go 
to the bathroom with friends, or 
the understanding that my body 
doesn’t lie on the desk of some 
old, white legislator. This may be 
in the form of gutting Planned 
Parenthood 
or 
prohibiting 

transgender people from using 
the bathroom that correlates to 
their gender identity.

When 
I 
came 
to 
the 

University, 
I 
believed 
my 

outsized 
wit, 
intellectual 

capacity 
and 
passion 
for 

knowledge 
undoubtedly 

unlocked the gates of one 
of the most selective public 
institutions in America. I didn’t 
consider the fact that I had an 
ACT tutor my parents dutifully 
sent checks to once a week, I 
came from a Caucasian family 
with 
an 
impressive 
yearly 

income, was born as a cisgender 
man and had grown up with the 
idea that going to college is a 
given. These are the elemental 
components of privilege that, 

as someone who is progressive 
attending a University with a 
diverse student body, I have 
decided to refuse to ignore.

In 
college, 
I 
have 
met 

students 
who 
come 
from 

vastly different socioeconomic 
backgrounds, 
ones 
which 

have not afforded them these 
conveniences that existing in 
the upper echelon of American 
society 
provides. 
Yet 
these 

students 
are 
undoubtedly 

smarter, more hardworking and 
passionate about any assortment 
of causes than I ever considered 
myself to be.

I can only be presumptuous 

about students who grew up in 
different 
circumstances 
than 

me. However, I can work as little 
as I want at the University and 
have an infinitesimal impact on 
this institution. I can accomplish 
the bare minimum and still come 
out being able to find work that 
allows me to continue existing 
within 
the 
stratosphere 
I 

currently inhabit.

Meanwhile, those with life 

skills far exceeding mine will 
still traverse a landscape of 
obstacles that are sometimes 
insurmountable 
because 

systems in place oppress many 
and give power to few. Those 
who have exhibited passion in 
facets and means that I can’t 
even fathom will still be rungs 
down a ladder that was built 
only for people with hands and 
feet like mine. This indicates 
that social mobility is a myth 
in the United States. This is a 
statement that I have become 
well-versed in yet have only 
really seen as an abstraction.

JOIN OUR EDITORIAL BOARD

Our Editorial Board meets Mondays and Wednesdays 7:15-8:45 PM at 
our newsroom at 420 Maynard Street. All are welcome to come discuss 

national, state and campus affairs.

I 
 

was 17 when I cut my hair 
into a pixie cut. It was my 
junior year of high school, 

and it had been an 
ongoing internal battle 
as I tried to decide if 
I was ready to make 
the 
chop. 
With 
the 

exception of a brief 
stint my freshman year 
of college, my hair has 
remained short. In fact, 
it’s gotten progressively 
shorter, 
culminating 

in a buzz cut when I 
lived in the woods for 
six weeks one summer. Now, 
at 22, I keep my hair clipped 
pretty close to my head. I don’t 
put product in it; I describe 
it, affectionately, as “fuzzy,” 
and I (involuntarily) give my 
numerous cowlicks free reign.

Something I’ve noticed is 

the way women compliment 
my hair. They lament about not 
being able to “pull off” the short 
hair look. They tell me they 
wish they were brave enough to 
cut their hair like I did. Some 
women feel it’s really important 
that I know I shouldn’t let 
people tell me my hair doesn’t 
look good. When I cut my hair, 
it wasn’t to make a statement. 
It was because my hair was big 
and I wanted to sleep more. 
In my mind, there were two 
options: sleep less and spend 
the time styling my hair or chop 
my hair and reap the benefits of 
an alarm set forty-five minutes 
later. I didn’t know then that 
there was a third option: just 
leave it alone. Sleep in, forget 
about my hair and let it frizz.

I know why I didn’t see 

that as an option. It’s the same 
reason the women who like 
my hair use words like “brave” 
and tell me they wish they 
could cut their hair while never 
considering that they could 
any 
time. 
Hair 
symbolizes 

femininity. 
There’s 
nothing 

more conventionally beautiful 
than long, straight and silky 
hair. Feeling like others might 
see you as attractive is wound 
up in having pretty hair. The 
women on the street who are 
insistent I shouldn’t let people 
make 
me 
believe 
anything 

negative about my hair are 
doing 
so 
because 
they’ve 

internalized 
this 
standard; 

even while they’re defying the 
notion that it takes long hair 
to look good, they’re assuming 
that it is just accepted, that I 
might need to be reassured the 
choice I made is acceptable.

Don’t get me wrong, I 

think this is kind of them. I’ve 
internalized the standard too, 
and it often takes effort to look 
at myself and others outside 
the lens of what is portrayed 
as beautiful. I’ve been pretty 
lucky, too; by being white, I’m 
already ahead of the game in 
terms of what is considered 
acceptable by society. Ankita 
Rao writes there are “societal 
pressures to adhere to beauty 
standards 
that 
typically 

embody a white, European 
aesthetic” that are especially 
harmful to women of color.

The thing about expecting 

hair to look a certain way is 
that it doesn’t take into account 
differences of hair texture, 

cultural 
styles, 

etc. It doesn’t care 
what is possible 
for 
your 
hair; 

society 
wants 

straight and shiny. 
This, 
besides 

being 
arbitrary 

and 
ridiculous, 

is actively toxic, 
especially 
for 

women of color. 
And 
while 
the 

standards of beauty are toxic 
in many ways that go beyond 
haircare, looking strictly at 
hair is enough to show how 
problematic the expectations — 
and the lengths to which they 
drive women — are.

A 
study 
by 
Perception 

Institute, titled “The ‘Good 
Hair’ Survey”, found Black 
women feel more anxiety than 
white women regarding their 
hair. It states, “One in five black 
women feel social pressure 
to straighten their hair for 
work — twice as many as white 
women,” and that this pressure 
came 
from 
biases; 
white 

women ranked Black women’s 
textured hair as “less beautiful, 
less sexy/attractive, and less 
professional than smooth hair.” 
In spring 2017, a Massachusetts 
public charter school punished 
two girls for their braided 
hair, claiming the style was an 
infraction against their uniform 
policy, which prohibited “hair 
extensions.”

This 
is 
just 
a 
small 

sampling of attitudes, and the 
issue is prevalent. Women of 
color are fired from jobs and 
discriminated against based 
on the hair styles they choose; 
hair styles that, because they 
are 
culturally 
significant 

and particular to textured 
hair 
not 
conventional 
in 

Western 
beauty 
standards, 

are seen as unprofessional and 
unattractive. Natural hair is 
often erased from the public 
eye; 
the 
Victoria’s 
Secret 

Fashion Show has gone on 
for 22 years, and only in the 
last three years has it include 
models 
with 
natural 
hair. 

In 
November 
2017, 
Lupita 

Nyong’o used Instagram to 
call out the magazine Grazia 
UK for editing and smoothing 
her hair without her consent 
when it featured her on the 
front page.

In response to all of these 

factors, women of color often 
feel pressure to use heat or 
chemicals to straighten their 
hair, 
meaning 
“compared 

with white women, women 
of color have higher levels 
of 
beauty 
product–related 

environmental chemicals in 
their bodies,” according to a 
Vice magazine article. Not only 
are the attitudes surrounding 
hair and beauty expectations 
toxic, but these expectations 
are literally, physically toxic.

There are women, too, who 

may lose their hair because 
of treatment for an illness, or 
because of a condition like 
alopecia. These women then 
have to grapple with their 
notion of femininity and their 
own self-image because of the 
pervasive standards of beauty. 
The pressures to conform to 
a certain standard are both 
internal and external, and all 
they do is cause trouble.

People took to the internet 

to praise the movie “Black 
Panther” for (among many 
other 
things) 
the 
female 

characters and their natural 
hairstyles. Patrice Williams, 
in an article or Hello Giggles, 
questions whether her own 
journey to accepting natural 
hair might have been made 
easier if there were more 
representation like that in 
“Black Panther”. From braids, 
to curls, to bald heads, the 
women in the movie are strong, 
powerful and rocking natural 
hairstyles. Representation like 
this allows women (and men!) 
to see that there is beauty 
outside 
enforced 
societal 

standards. Beauty standards 
are 
largely 
arbitrary, 
and 

highlighting women who don’t 
fit these molds is important 
for young girls growing up 
and figuring out how they feel 
about themselves.

I 
support 
whatever 
a 

woman wants to do with 
her hair. Cut it off, wear it 
long, straighten it, let it curl; 
whatever makes sowwmeone 
comfortable is what she should 
go for. What I don’t like is the 
pressures that make us feel 
like there’s a right option for 
us, and that the option should 
be pursued, even if it’s not in 
our best interest.

Every time a woman tells 

me she wishes she could cut 
her hair, I want to tell her, “But 
you can!” I want to tell her it’s 
worth it to take the leap, even 
if she isn’t doing it to make a 
statement or liberate herself, 
she might find these things 
happen anyway. But I know it’s 
hard; it’s scary to know people 
might stare, to know you’re 
deliberately 
going 
against 

what the world tells you 
to do to be beautiful. But 
when I can, I try to gently 
encourage 
them 
to 
think 

about what they’re afraid of, 
why they couldn’t go ahead 
and chop it all off. Pulling 
it off isn’t real; what is real 
is 
following 
your 
heart 

and rejoicing in the first 
shampoo with inches of hair 
gone.

The Wonder Years cinch 
the gaps in ‘Sister Cities’

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

It was a chilly day on Mar. 30 in 

Wicker Park, one I was thoroughly 
unprepared for after a four-hour 
drive into Chicago earlier in the 
morning. I clutched a copy of Toni 
Morrison’s 
“Beloved,” 
reading 

and shivering with my hands 
in my sleeves, waiting in a line 
that circled around the back of a 
storefront. Upon finally entering 
the shop — a pop-up put on by a 
band known as The Wonder Years 
in preparation for the release of 
their newest record Sister Cities — 
I approached a copy of the record’s 
accompanying poetry/photo book. 
Flipping through, I encountered an 
image spanning two of the book’s 
massive pages that immediately 
caught my eye: a photo of lead 
singer Dan Campbell crying in 
the rain on his knees in front of 
a shrine. I was forced to take a 
moment to recompose myself, 
blindsided by the visceral sorrow 
of the photograph.

I’ve spent the last five years of my 

life trying to explain to everyone 
around me why The Wonder 
Years are the best band to have 
ever existed. Five years that began 
with “‘Dismantling Summer’ is 
pure poetry, you need to listen to 
this,” which transitioned to “OK, 
so when ‘Cigarettes and Saints’ 
dropped I literally shut down for 24 
hours,” and finally to, “Yes, I drove 

six hours to a small town in Illinois 
on a whim to see them play, it’s not 
that big of a deal.” After five years 
of this, I’ll be absolutely damned if 
The Wonder Years doesn’t shatter 
the punk ceiling with Sister Cities.

Accompanying 
the 
release 

of 
their 
sixth 
album 
is 
an 

intricate rollout comprised of the 
aforementioned pop-up shops in 
both Chicago and Philadelphia, 
and in-store acoustic performances 
across the East and Midwest. 
The hard work and detail of their 
efforts shows a band full of passion, 

earnestly giving their fans an 
intimate opportunity to experience 
their art through these curated 
mediums. Along with copies of 
the poetry/photo books, the shop 
space also included framed photos 
from 
the 
extensive 
traveling 

that largely inspired Sister Cities 
and unique merchandise. I was 
fortunate enough to attend both 
days of the pop-up shop in Chicago, 
and during a Q&A midway through 
the second evening’s performance, 
frontman Dan Campbell gave 
a simple explanation for their 
intricate promotional efforts as 
a way for the band to reach out to 
their fans: “Please, please come 
listen to this; come be a part of 
this.”

On Sister Cities we find a band 

shedding the introspection of 
their past records, looking out 
into a world they’ve toured twice 
over, the title itself suggesting a 
breakdown of cultural divisions. 
They’re 
moving 
beyond 
the 

sadness, guilt and frustration 
that mark most of their previous 
material, 
writing 
songs 
that 

appeal to human sensibility rather 
than their signature cathartic 
emotionality that might seem more 
niche. They’ve taken immense 
risks with their writing on Sister 
Cities, risks that more than exceed 
what has come to be expected of a 
punk-rooted band with indie-rock 
heart. Second single “Pyramids 
of Salt” reveals a newfound 
control over tension and volume, 
with some of the highest highs 
and lowest lows on the record; 
Campbell’s soft notes grace the 
verses while bellowing vocals burst 
from the chorus. The band takes 
this a step further on the closing 
song “The Ocean Grew Hands to 
Hold Me,” an epic, six-minute track 
that swells and crashes as intensely 
as its namesake. “What strikes me 
most is the symmetry,” Campbell 
sings softly on “Flowers Where 
Your Face Should Be,” a song 
that tenderly reveals its gorgeous 
lyrical and compositional layers as 
it progresses. Campbell is referring 
to the symmetrical nature of the 
human experience — language, 
culture and race aside, we all share 
this common ground. Love, in all of

its forms, is the symmetry of being 
human, and this is the underlying 
basis for Sister Cities. Because of 
love we feel loss; because of love 
we feel comfort; because of love we 
are the same.

The 
Wonder 
Years 
slowly 

revealed this theme even before the 
album was officially announced. 
A website was posted in late Jan. 
listing coordinates throughout the 
globe that lead to clues to unlock 
the album’s trailer. I happened to be 
in Manhattan when these arrived, 
and met a complete stranger also 
looking for the elusive poster in 
Chinatown. A small amount of 
mysterious seven inch records — 
one side containing “We Looked 
Like Lightning” and the other a 
poem in many languages — were 
sent across the globe to lucky fans. 

I watched, literally in real time, as 
fans frantically tried to translate 
the poem together over social 
media, a little shocked but more 
awe-inspired by how easily we are 
connected in today’s world. On the 
seven inch’s single, Campbell sings, 
“Sew the world together tightly 
/ Cinch the gaps with pins and 
string,” something the band was 
able to accomplish with their fans 
all within a few days’ time.

And this is exactly what makes 

Sister Cities a one-of-a-kind album, 
a collection of songs cinching 
the gaps between me, you and 
everyone else. I mention this not 
out of grandiosity, but rather out 
of exactly what I have observed, 
emotionally 
and 
physically, 

throughout my years as a fan of 
this band. The Wonder Years, 

like the human experience, have 
connected people not just across 
state lines, but across borders and 
oceans.

The Wonder Years have written 

a record so universally resonant, so 
globally-minded, it’d be misguided 
to try and ignore it. With Sister 
Cities, the band has shattered the 
thematic expectations of their 
roots, reaching out to the world 
from their interior rather than 
focusing on it. I feel fortunate to 
exist in a world where, beneath 
political 
tensions, 
a 
constant 

stream of trauma and tragedy 
and a world that feels constantly 
on the brink of collapse, we have 
a band like The Wonder Years 
cutting through the divisive chaos 
to uncover a common, human 
heartbeat.

A new mediocre rom-com

Recently, 
music 
video 

short films have blossomed 
in quality. Take Beyoncé’s 
“Lemonade” visual album or 
her protégés, Chloe x Halle, 
and their video for “The Kids 
Are Alright.” These short films 
mix strong music with striking 
visuals, combining different 
artforms to create an elevated 
final product. Netflix’s new 
film “Paradox” does not meet 
this new standard. Not even a 
little. In her directorial debut, 
Daryl Hannah (“Kill Bill”) 
teams up with musician Neil 
Young to make, as she puts it, 
a “more pot than plot” film. 
Let’s just say, the influences of 
medicinals are present.

If I didn’t know any better, 

I would assume “Paradox” 
was actually a student-made 
parody of a Neil Young music 
video. It’s that bad. Where 
to start? The majority of the 
film follows men dressed in 
shabby costumes, improvising 
lines people would only find 
funny after a concentrated 
dose of THC. These men are 
Neil Young and his backup 
band Promise of the Real. The 
legendary Willie Nelson also 
makes a brief appearance. 
In other words, these are all 
amateur actors. At times, I 
wondered if the cameraman 
forgot he hit record since 
the feet of the actors often 
made 
unexplained 
cameos. 

Then there were the poorly 

timed, unfortunate angles that 
captured many crotch shots 
and rear ends all in horribly 
lit scenes. It’s a shame some 
of the most well-lit moments 
included watching a man take 
a piss in the woods. What was 
the relevance of this moment 
to 
the 
film? 
Absolutely 

nothing.

The 
cinematographer 
of 

“Paradox” also decided to 

switch 
nonsensically 
from 

digital to 16mm. The scenes 
shot on film must have been an 
attempt to appear alternative 
and hipster. This need for a 
vintage vibe might explain the 
long time lapses of clouds and 
the Northern lights. I can’t 
help but wish the filmmakers 
had spent less time switching 
cameras 
and 
more 
time 

planning the point of the 
film. Instead, “Paradox” boils 
down to a bored musician’s 
attempt to satisfy a desire 
to be on camera. For fans of 
Neil Young’s music, never 
watch this film. Not even the 
trailer. “Paradox” will ruin his 
music forever. The rich vocals, 
instrumentals 
and 
behind-

the-scenes shots of Young 
rehearsing are the only bright 
side of the film. However, 
those songs have been around 
for quite some time, and this 
just might ruin their legacy.

The only part of “Paradox” 

worth watching is when the 

musicians 
gather 
around 

the campfire to sing Willie 
Nelson’s song “Angel Flying 
Too Close to the Ground.” 
Promise of the Real, a band 
led by Nelson’s sons Lukas 
and Micah, play an acoustic, 
soulful cover with bongos, a 
double bass (because cowboys 
on the run carry 30-pound 
instruments) 
and 
various 

guitars. 
The 
camera 
pans 

around the musicians and the 
microphone rings with the 
crackle of sparks from the fire. 
This serene and breathtaking 
moment should have been the 
template for the whole film. If 
“Paradox” were structured as 
a concert film with occasional, 
silent 
flashes 
of 
Western 

scenes, 
it 
would 
thrive. 

However, this is not the case. 
In the end, the ghastly visuals 
eviscerate the tenderness and 
rawness of the music. Anything 
wonderful about the campfire 
sequence is forgotten when 
the following scenes include 
someone watching a magnified 
caterpillar crawl by — greeting 
it with a “Hey there, big 
fellow” — before proceeding to 
take a dump with his buddy in 
an outhouse. But hey, give the 
filmmakers credit for shooting 
the outhouse from several 
angles and on film; nothing 
screams dreamy and nostalgic 
than two grown men having 
a conversation while on the 
can. If I were Neil Young, I 
would buy back the rights to 
“Paradox” from Netflix and 
bury the footage where no one 
would ever find it.

FILM REVIEW

‘Paradox’ feels like parody
Some films seem destined to 

succeed. Look at any Marvel 
movie, complete with a star 
director, superstar cast and 
a plot as uninteresting as it 
is easily digestible. The same 
could be said of Netflix’s 
“Happy 
Anniversary.” 

Director Jared Stern (“The 
Internship”) is an established 
comedy writer with a number 
of films under his belt. The 
film’s leads Ben Schwartz 
(“Parks and Recreation”) and 
Noël Wells (“Master of None”) 
are energetic, young and have 
turned in good performances 
before. The plot is a unique 
twist on the usual rom-com, 
chronicling a couple stuck in 
a rut and struggling to decide 
whether their relationship is 
worth the middle-aged decay 
sure to follow. It’s a strange 
feeling, then, to leave “Happy 
Anniversary” 
and 
wonder 

what exactly the point was. 

First, the acting is fantastic. 

Sam (Schwartz) and Mollie 
(Wells) 
have 
a 
palpable 

chemistry, 
replete 
with 

their own inside jokes, little 
quirks and a marked dislike 
for other people. Much of 
the story is told in flashback, 
with 
perfume 
bottles 
or 

certain store signs triggering 
memories of the past as the 
couple search for a reason 
to stay together. We learn 
about their funny traditions, 
like escaping to a mountain 
retreat and pretending to be a 
wealthy hedge fund manager 
and accompanying hooker. It’s 
particularly rewarding to see 
a different side of the actors 
— especially Ben Schwartz, 
who played the brash, reckless 

and flirtatious Jean-Ralphio 
in “Parks and Rec.” In “Happy 
Anniversary,” he turns in an 
unexpectedly sweet, caring 
and composed performance. 
In one scene, Sam tries to flirt 
with another girl but realizes 
he really cares about Mollie, 
an attachment Jean-Ralphio 
would never understand. 

Unfortunately, 
that’s 
the 

only redeeming feature of the 
film. The central conflict, 
Mollie’s 
unhappiness, 
fails 

to 
be 
convincing. 
While 

her flightiness in the face 
of an uncertain future is 
understandable, it feels like 
she blows everything out of 
proportion by calling Sam 
unromantic and running to her 
parents on their anniversary. 
Since there’s never truly a 
falling out, their reunion is 
inevitable. 
Everything 
in 

the middle is an unrelenting 
trudge 
through 
rom-com 

staples en route to the happily 
ever after both Mollie and 
Sam keep saying is impossible. 
There’s Mollie’s parents, who 
barely speak to each other 
but are trapped in a marriage 
without a spark, and eventually 
they reignite Mollie’s love for 
Sam by warning her not to end 
up like them. There’s Sam’s 
all-knowing confidante, who 
instantly tells him to leave 
Mollie but later helps them 
get back together. And then 
there’s Mollie’s old flame Arik, 
who precipitates the worst of 
their fight by texting her to 
come back to him. 

The writing does little to 

allay the cliché factor, with 

moments of remembering the 
good times undone by over-
the-top lines like, “It doesn’t 
feel the same without her.” The 
subtlety and unexpectedness 
of these tender episodes are 
totally ruined by a grandiose, 
wannabe 
romantic 
script, 

which 
threatens 
to 
sound 

like 
Anakin 
and 
Padme’s 

Shakespearean 
dialogue 

in “Attack of the Clones” if 
not for the authenticity of 
the acting. Even the humor 
is often a beat too late, the 
punchline 
exposed 
by 
an 

entrance too early, a pause too 
long, a character too flat. 

Eventually, 
Sam 
and 

Mollie realize that they’re 
happy 
together 
and 
one 

can never really know if 
they’ve found the one. But 
these are epiphanies already 
documented by hundreds of 
other films and beaten to death 
over the course of the movie, 
well before the romantic kiss 
on the balcony and heart-to-
heart where they tell each 
other as much. 

Most disappointing is that 

after slogging through the 
whirlwind day of breakups, 
misadventures and a cycling 
cast of people determined 
to kill what spark is left in 
the 
relationship, 
nothing 

seems 
to 
have 
changed. 

Mollie is still bossy; Sam is 
still indecisive. They have 
no new ideas on how to keep 
from ending up like Mollie’s 
parents. In the end, “Happy 
Anniversary” is a watered-
down 
collection 
of 
easy 

answers and unadventurous 
writing, 
focused 
more 
on 

commercial appeal than an 
intimate, 
powerful 
journey 

from happiness to hurt and 
back again. The result? A love 
story for the masses.

“I 
don’t 
know 
if 
you’re 

supposed to put your contour on 
before the rest of your makeup, or 
after the rest of your makeup. But 
it doesn’t matter. Because men 
are stupid. As long as you look like 
a newborn baby, they are willing 
to mate with you,” YouTube guru 
Sailor J announces in a video 
titled “Contouring 101.”

“Makeup is for women who 

want husbands,” she continues. 
“Contouring is for women who 
want to leech the souls of their 
dead lovers and collect the 
inheritance of their ex-boyfriends 
who 
disappeared 
under 

mysterious circumstances.”

“Beautiful women don’t have 

foreheads ... if you have too big 
of a brain, it means you have 
ugly things, like opinions, and 
thoughts of your own,” she says, 
while dabbing a contouring stick 
around her nose. Incidentally, she 
speaks in an exaggerated British 
accent the entire time, and her 
makeup looks are incredible, but 
that is beside my point.

“Contouring 101” isn’t new; it 

went viral a few months ago (and 
admittedly, I did bully all of my 
friends into watching it several 
times). Sailor J is currently in the 
military, as well as an aspiring 
writer; her comedic timing is 
impeccable and her satirical 
take-downs are flawless. This 
particular video is colored by an 
awareness of what many women 
know: Guys often have no idea 
what a “natural look” of makeup 
actually looks like or takes to 
achieve. It’s also a subtle tongue-
in-cheek call-out of the whole 
“take her swimming on the first 
date” joke.

Beyond that subtle framework, 

I love that she’s giving wildly 
funny feminist satire while doing 
her makeup, but she is completely 
uninterested 
in 
defending 

her choice to spend money on 
makeup, or make videos about 
it, or enjoy using it. Whether 
or not makeup — producing 
it, packaging it in a “self-love” 
/ “self-care” vein, selling it, 
applying it or wearing it — can 
be a feminist act feels almost 
irrelevant now, at least in terms 
of practical priorities. There are 
just more important things to 
worry about right now.

Sailor J does some makeup 

looks and videos — “Harry Potter” 
houses, astrological signs and 

drunk book reviews — that subtly 
convey her political commentary. 
In others, her point is much more 

straightforward, such as “How to 
Do Thanksgiving Makeup That 
Has Nothing to Do with the 566 
Federally Recognized Tribes,” 
in which she addresses cultural 
appropriation with a blend of 
sensitivity, grace and humor that 
is often difficult to accomplish 

even for experienced TV anchors 
and writers.

The reason I haven’t been able 

to stop about thinking Sailor J 
recently (aside from her hilarious 
Twitter presence) is one of 
her most recent videos: “T & P 
Makeup Look.” In other words, 

“Thoughts and Prayers.” In it, 
she uses makeup as a satirical 
vehicle with which to address 
the government’s response to the 
Parkland shooting.

“Thoughts 
and 
Prayers 

Makeup look … it isn’t a new 
line, it’s been out for a while, 
you’ve probably seen a lot of rich 
indifferent people in Congress 
tweeting about it very often, 
usually after a national tragedy 
like the Parkland shooting … 
We have highlighters right here, 
contour kits, mascara, eyeliner, 
blush,” she says, pointing in turn 
to empty patches of her carpet on 
which the makeup products are 
said to be.

“The foundation is called, ‘If 

you’re white, it’s a mental illness, 
and if you’re brown you’re a 
terrorist … if you can’t see it, 
it’s probably because you’re not 
strong enough in the spirit.” she 
then proceeds to take a brush, 
dab it on her face, and say, peering 
straight into the camera, “Wow, 
I can really see the change, 
happening right here.”

“This 
mascara 
is 
called 

bulletproof black. It’s supposed 
to match the vests that we’ll have 
to start putting on our children if 
we want them to make it past the 
sixth f—king grade.”

“Next 
we’re 
gonna 
do 
a 

highlighter … it’s called ‘money’ 
because that’s all our country 
cares about.”

“Blush. I’m gonna go with, ‘the 

blood of our children,’ because 
it’s what we’re bathing in these 
days.”

Her eyes glint as she delivers 

the last line of the bit: “Just 
embrace the line, because nothing 
stops a bullet like thoughts and 
prayers.” It’s a very “The Emperor 
Wears No Clothes” moment.

Sailor J often uses makeup as 

a vehicle to make other points, 
but her points have nothing to do 
with whether makeup itself is a 
feminist action or product, which 
is refreshing. Her commentary 
is witty, blunt and unflinchingly 
honest. Recently, she tweeted 
about 
her 
upcoming 
profile 

that will run in The New York 
Times in April. She wants SNL 
to hire her as a writer, and they 
should; she would be incredible. 
Her voice stands out against 

the cacophony of social justice 

voices ping-ponging off each 
other on the Internet.

Marina Keegan and ‘The 
Opposite of Loneliness’

As writers, we sometimes 

need to be reminded of why we 
do what we do. Why we write.

It can get exhausting — 

putting all your faith and 
passion into the ink of a 
pen which turns to words, 
words that turn to sentences, 
sentences that turn into a 
memoir. And then there’s a 
reality I confront at least 10 
times a day: Why do I do this? 
Why do I want to do this?

When the writer’s block has 

made home in the front of my 
skull with the agonizing reality 
that people everywhere have 
stories that they are sitting 
down and just writing, when 
I envy and lust after the idea, 
or perhaps just the thought, 
of a straightforward path — of 
business school and medical 
school and any other more 
conventional “school” — when 
I face the fear that maybe, just 
maybe, nobody will ever walk 
into a bookstore with my name 
burning at the tip of their 
tongue, that’s when I need 
“The Opposite of Loneliness” 
by Marina Keegan.

My senior year of high 

school, 
I 
considered 
my 

future plan with a head on my 

shoulders that I sometimes 
think my parents wished I 
had back then. I would put 
the writing and theatre on the 
back burner, and take a more 
predictable path: psychology, 
or perhaps political science. 
I’d be pre-law, and I would 
successfully ignore the 3:00 
a.m. itches at the tips of my 
fingers to pick up my notebook 
and jot down thoughts of an 
early morning poem.

But 
then 
I 
read 
“The 

Opposite of Loneliness” by 
Marina 
Keegan, 
which 
I 

found in the Yale University 
bookstore, tucked into the 
inner elbow of a city that I 
once thought was my destiny, 
but instead was simply not 
meant to be.

I am envious of my 15 year 

old self, sitting in my room with 
my book light and my favorite 
mug reading the words that 
have become my constitution, 
my Hail Mary, paving the 
way for my future. Little did 
I know then, that I’d finish it 
in one warm New Jersey, Sept. 
evening, walk downstairs to 
our breakfast table the next 
morning and declare the same 
words that Keegan did in her 
years as an exhausted and 
passionate undergrad:

I want to be a writer. Like, a 

real one. With my life.

I can’t quite explain my 

attraction to “The Opposite 
of Loneliness,” but in terms 
of literary affairs, this one is 
hot, quick and intense. It is 
everything I’ve ever thought 
about love, and it is everything 
I’ve ever thought about pain. 
It has made me feel in so many 
capacities, with each read 
more different than the last. 
It is also a love that ends in 
heartbreak.

Keegan died at 23, only days 

after her graduation from Yale 
as an undergraduate, and never 
lived to see the publication 
of her collection of short 
stories, poetry and narrative 
nonfiction. Instead, she caught 
fame and stature only after 
tragedy struck behind the 
wheel, taking her life.

It’s strange and desolate 

to think that the words that 
changed my life came from 
a mind that can no longer 
imagine, and that the stories 
that reminded me of my place 
on this earth came from a 
heart that no longer beats.

It was “The Opposite of 

Loneliness” that told me, “I 
want enough time to be in love 
with everything … because 
everything is so beautiful and 
so short.”

“We can change our minds,” 

Keegan writes. “We can start

over. The notion that it’s too 
late to do anything is comical. 
It’s hilarious. We can’t, we 
must not lose this sense of 
possibility because in the end 
it’s all we have.”

And 
most 
importantly: 

“We’re so young. We’re so 
young. 
We’re 
twenty-two 

years old. We have so much 
time. There’s this sentiment 
I sometimes sense, creeping 
in our collective conscious 
as we lie alone after a party, 
or pack up our books when 
we give in and go out — that 
it is somehow too late. That 
others are somehow ahead. 
More 
accomplished, 
more 

specialized. More on the path 
to somehow saving the world, 
somehow creating or inventing 
or improving. That it’s too late 
now to BEGIN a beginning and 
we must settle for continuance, 
for commencement.”

It’s 
“The 
Opposite 
of 

Loneliness” that has me here 
— hunched over my laptop in 
a corner of Ann Arbor with 
tears in my eyes and a large 
iced coffee with two splendas 
next to me, wishing my hands 
would just write the words I 
wish I could articulate: I am so 
goddamned lucky to be here, 
to be actively pursuing a world 
of creation and make believe, 
to be doing the one and only 
thing my heart has always 
known it was meant for.

I wish for a day I could sit 

across from Marina Keegan at 
a table in a coffee shop, look at 

her with tears on my cheeks 
and search desperately for the 
words I don’t know if I’ll ever 
be able to find, to thank her for 
this piece of literature, these 
stories, this gift — something 
that gave me a reason to fall 
head over heels in love with 

words again after years spent 
struggling 
to 
break 
away 

from them. It’s so difficult 
to wrap my head around the 
fact that there will never be a 

way to thank her — not even 
a fan email that winds up in 
her junk mail somewhere in 
cyberspace.

At least then, I could have 

hope.

I think sometimes we lose 

or misplace who we are. We 
get wrapped up in this world 
of SAT tutors and adolescence 
and hormones and everything 
else 
that 
leads 
to 
the 

dangerous cocktail that had 
me doubting the most genuine, 
authentic 
me. 
Pushing 

away books because they’re 
fiction and not reality, or 
putting down my pen because 
someone 
somewhere 
with 

some irrelevant opinion once 
told me that art cannot pay 
the bills. But when I misplaced 
myself and lied through my 
teeth to guidance counselors 
with 
good 
intentions 
and 

parents with better ones, I 
thought for a moment that 
maybe I’d really be a lawyer or 
a psychologist or a therapist.

“The 
Opposite 
of 

Loneliness” has done more 
than build me. It has re-built 
me. It has reconstructed me 
and reinvigorated me and fed 
me with a desire to do the 
only thing I really can. I’m 
eternally indebted to Marina 
Keegan for shining a light on 
life, reaching between the 
pages of a book and shaking 
me until I saw the truth: You 
are a writer. You always will 
be.

A real one. With your life.

Season in Review: The Michigan women’s basketball team

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team started the 
season by raising a banner and 
ended it by earning a trip to 
the NCAA Tournament, where 
it fell to Baylor in the second 
round. The Wolverines won the 
Women’s National Invitational 
Tournament 
in 
2017, 
but 

disappointment over being left 
out of the tournament field 
carried over to this season.

From the first day of this 

season, Michigan’s goal was to go 
dancing for the first time since 
2013 — and it did. After tearing 
through 
the 
non-conference 

portion of the schedule — just 
losing to eventual champion 
Notre Dame and a Louisville 
team whose season ended in the 
Final Four — the Wolverines 
seemed to cement a tournament 
bid with a road win at then-No. 8 
Ohio State on Jan. 16.

But Michigan went on to drop 

five of six games over the first 
two weeks of February, setting 
off alarm bells at Crisler Center. 
On Senior Night though, with 
the potential of missing the 
tournament hanging in the air, 
the Wolverines upset then-No. 13 
Maryland, finishing the regular 
season 22-9 with a 10-6 mark in 
the Big Ten, good for sixth place in 
the conference. After exiting the 
Big Ten Tournament with a loss 
to Nebraska in the quarterfinals, 
Michigan was selected as a No. 7 
seed for the NCAA Tournament. 
The Wolverines beat Northern 
Colorado in the first round, but 
ended their season quietly with 
a 22-point loss at Baylor in the 
second.

The Daily looks back on the 

season that was.

Best game: Michigan 84, 

Ohio State 75 

The Wolverines came into 

Columbus without a signature 
win, 
having 
dropped 
an 

overtime heartbreaker to the 
Buckeyes nine days earlier in 
Ann Arbor. They left with their 
first win over Ohio State since 
2015, ending a streak that lasted 
three years and five days.

After going into the half 

down five points, Michigan 
battled 
back. 
Junior 
center 

Hallie Thome scored 21 of her 
27 points and grabbed 10 of her 
11 rebounds in the second half. 
Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
put up 18 of her own in the latter 
period, including a go-ahead 
3-pointer with two minutes to 
go in the third quarter. Unlike 
the prior contest against Ohio 
State, 
which 
saw 
Flaherty 

miss a potential game-winner 
at the buzzer, the Wolverines 
left nothing to chance. They 
outscored the Buckeyes by 14 in 
the second half, sealing a rivalry 
win and a resume booster.

Worst game: Purdue 81, 

Michigan 79 (OT)

This was well on its way 

to being an easy win. The 
Wolverines held a 16-point lead 
with just under seven minutes 
to go in the game. It would have 
been 
their 
seventh 
straight 

victory 
— 
a 
domineering 

performance over a conference 
foe — but Michigan simply 
collapsed, going without a point 
for the last 6:48 of regulation.

The 
Wolverines 
coughed 

up turnover after turnover. 
Flaherty had a chance to stop 
the bleeding with a layup once 
Michigan’s lead was cut to 
two. It was blocked away, then 
freshman forward Hailey Brown 

turned it over on the ensuing 
inbounds pass. Boilermakers’ 
guard Dominique Oden tied it 
at 72, hitting a baseline floater 
with just under one second to 
go. Sophomore forward Kayla 
Robbins managed to get to the 
line with a chance to win it, 
even after all that, but clanked 
both free throws. In overtime, 
the Wolverines were down one 
with just over a minute to go and 
couldn’t find a bucket.

It was as tough a loss as you 

could imagine — and it sent 
Michigan on a tailspin. It lost 
three of its next four — all games 
in which the Wolverines were 
ranked and their opponents were 
not — jeopardizing its chances 
at an NCAA Tournament bid.

Best 
individual 

performance: 
Katelynn 

Flaherty 
against 

Northwestern

When Flaherty got it going 

this 
season, 
it 
was 
truly 

mesmerizing to watch. She hit 
the 30-point mark three times 
— including a 33-point game 
against Penn State in which the 
senior hit 10 3-pointers — but 
even that comes in second.

When the Wildcats visited 

Crisler on Feb. 8, Flaherty almost 
singlehandedly 
demolished 

them. She scored 36 on 12-of-
21 shooting, dropping 3-pointer 

after 3-pointer, finishing 9-of-
16 from beyond the arc. It was 
a shooting performance for 
the ages, one of those nights 
when 
Flaherty 
was 
simply 

unstoppable. The Wolverines 
easily pulled away in the game, 
winning 84-63, but that almost 
became a sideshow in the face of 
the sheer absurdity of Flaherty.

To add onto what was already 

an incredible game, Flaherty 
sustained a foot injury mid-
game. It didn’t slow her down 
though, as she scored 16 of 
her points in the second half, 
playing all 20 minutes of the 
latter period.

Flaherty is undoubtedly the 

best player in program history. 
This will go among her best 
games ever in a Michigan 
uniform.

Most 
important 
game: 

Michigan 71, Maryland 65

Though coach Kim Barnes 

Arico didn’t tell the team in 
the lead-up, the Wolverines’ 
season could have hinged on 
this game. They came in having 
lost five of the last six, their 
chances for a tournament bid 
having gone from set-in-stone 
to shaky. They needed an upset 
over the 13th-ranked Terrapins 
to put fears of repeating the 
heartbreak of 2017 to rest. And 
they got it.

Sophomore forward Akienreh 

Johnson, who had averaged 
just 2.5 points per game on the 
season up to that point, played 
the hero. She scored 17 points, 
including a dagger 3-pointer 
with just under two minutes 
left, on 8-of-11 shooting to go 
with eight rebounds.

To put it simply, it’s quite 

possible Michigan wouldn’t have 
made the tournament without 
winning that game, without that 
out-of-nowhere 
performance 

from Johnson. It needed to pull 
an upset win out of the sky to do 
it, and when the chance came, 
the Wolverines took it.

Most 
improved 
player: 

Hailey Brown

The freshman started her 

career quietly, hitting double-
digit scoring just six times in 
the season’s first 17 games. She 
did so as many times in her 
next eight games, breaking out 
with a 23-point, eight-rebound 
performance on Jan. 10 against 
Indiana and sprinting through 
the rest of her season.

Brown was well on her way 

to establishing herself as a go-to 
scorer for the Wolverines at 
that point, but her season ended 
early. She suffered a leg injury at 
Michigan State just over a month 
after that breakout performance 
and never came back.

Despite a disappointing end to 

her season, Brown established 
herself as a potential star for 
the 
Wolverines 
come 
next 

year. Assuming a full recovery, 
her production will likely go 
up in the wake of Flaherty’s 
departure.

Most 
valuable 
player: 

Katelynn Flaherty

This one didn’t take much 

thinking. Flaherty came into the 
season with a chance to cement 
herself as an all-time great. She 
did that, and more, breezing past 
Diane Dietz for the program’s 
all-time scoring record early in 
the year before smashing Glen 
Rice’s men’s scoring record in 
January, becoming Michigan’s 
all-time leading scorer in either 
category.

Flaherty, to no one’s surprise, 

led the Wolverines in scoring 
with 22.9 points per game, 

shooting 44.3 percent from 
outside. 
Even 
when 
teams 

continually face-guarded her 
through Big Ten play, even when 
she suffered injuries to her back 
and foot, Flaherty continued to 
score at an absurd clip. More 
than that, she averaged 36.8 
minutes per game, never sitting 
out a game, and played 40 or 
more minutes nine times.

Flaherty 
exits 
Michigan 

as the program’s best player 
ever, bar none. Unless there’s 
some sort of baffling oversight, 
she will become the first ever 
women’s basketball player to see 
her number retired — and with 
good reason.

Up next:
The Wolverines will have to 

deal with the losses of Flaherty 
and 
senior 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston, 
whose 
rebounding 

and 
defense 
helped 
anchor 

them throughout the year. In all 
likelihood, junior guard Nicole 
Munger will see an uptick 
in shot attempts as a result. 
Thome, 
Michigan’s 
second-

leading scorer this season, will 
become even more important to 
the Wolverines’ success as well.

Freshman 
guard 
Deja 

Church will be expected to take 
over point-guard duties from 
Flaherty after a strong defensive 
campaign. Her offensive output 
— just seven points per game on 
43.9 percent shooting from the 
field — will have to get better, 
though. Brown and Johnson 
— both of whom have been 
hampered by injury in the past 
— will be expected to put it all 
together.

Barnes 
Arico’s 
recruiting 

class — which ranks 12th in the 
country, per HoopGurlz — will 
be key in bringing Michigan 
back to the NCAA Tournament. 
Five-star point guard Amy Dilk 
could challenge Church for the 
starting job. Naz Hillmon and 
Emily 
Kiser, 
both 
four-star 

forwards, could see playing 
time along with fellow four-star 
guard Ariel Young.

Even with the Wolverines 

losing the program’s best ever 
player in Flaherty, they should be 
fairly optimistic about making it 
back to the tournament in 2019.

Ruiz set to become ‘quarterback of the O-Line’

After an 8-5 season, fingers 

get pointed every which way.

And in the case of Michigan 

in 2017, many of those fingers 
aimed squarely at the offensive 
line.

“I think they took a lot of 

blame for a lot of things on 
the outside. A lot of fingers 
pointed at that direction, but 
not always are the fingers 
accurate,” said new offensive 
line coach Ed Warriner, a 
beneficiary of some of that 
finger pointing. Warriner was 
hired as an offensive coach in 
January and later assigned to 
the offensive line to replace 
the departed Tim Drevno.

“There’s a lot of pieces in all 

things,” Warriner told media 
on Thursday afternoon. “Short 
yardage, there’s tight ends and 
fullbacks. Protections, there’s 
tight ends, fullbacks running 
backs 
and 
quarterbacks 

involved in that. My perception 
is, the group was a solid group 
when I got it.”

That 
much-maligned 

group returns three starters 
from a season ago, juniors 
Ben Bredeson and Michael 
Onwenu, 
and 
sophomore 

center Cesar Ruiz. With those 
three penciled in along the 
interior of the line, the tackle 
spots remain up for grabs — 
likely 
between 
sophomores 

Chuck 
Filiaga 
and 
James 

Hudson, 
junior 
Stephen 

Spinellis 
and 

seniors Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty 
and Jon Runyan 
Jr. 

As 
of 
now, 

your 
guess 

is as good as 
Warriner’s as to 
who emerges for 
those spots.

“Eventually 

(we’ll) 
sort 

through the five best and get 
them where they need to go.”

But one thing’s for certain: 

Cesar Ruiz is one of those best 
five. Based off early praise, he 
might be the best one.

“He understands football 

very well,” Warriner said. 
“But he is very powerful, 
plays with a good base, loves 
football, quick feet for a 
center, too. He kinda has the 
whole package.”

And Warriner knows what 

that package looks like. He 
coached for three years at Ohio 
State, following two years at 
Notre Dame — both places he 
eagerly 
anticipates 
visiting 

this 
year 
on 

the 
opposite 

sideline. 
He 

has 
produced 

enough 
NFL 

talent 
to 

know 
how 

that 
appears 

in 
a 
college 

sophomore.

Ruiz has it.
“I 
have 

two 
starting 

centers 
in 
the 
National 

Football League, both started 
as rookies,” Warriner said, 
referring 
to 
Minnesota 

Vikings center Pat Elflein 
and Green Bay Packers center 
Corey Linsley. “He has that 

kind of ability some day to get 
to that point. Not yet, I mean 
he’s just a young kid. But if 
he keeps going, I know what 
they look like. … He can be the 
quarterback of the O-Line.”

Added Runyan Jr.: “He’s one 

of the most athletic centers 
I’ve ever seen. He’s big, strong, 
powerful. I’m looking forward 
to what he can do, even though 
he’s only a sophomore, so 
that’s really really exciting to 
see his development.”

For Warriner, though, being 

an effective center extends far 
beyond the physical toolset. 
The 
“quarterback 
of 
the 

O-Line” means what it sounds 
like — being a vocal leader and 
decision-maker. 

That’s something that Ruiz 

has taken hold of with his 
command.

Ruiz 
was 
recruited 
to 

Michigan as a center but 
played in 10 games last year as 
a guard. He became the starter 
midway through the season, 
as a stopgap at guard. This 
season, he’ll head back to his 
natural position.

“Your center makes a lot 

of calls in there that set your 
protections, and if he sets 
them wrong then you’ve got 
problems,” Warriner said. “If 
he sets them right, then you 
can account for everybody. 
He’s been very good at that 
this spring. Very good.”

Warriner will say he thinks 

this group could develop into 
a “very solid Big Ten offensive 
line.”

There’s 
no 
guaranteeing 

any offensive line renaissance. 
Words are just words, coated 
in a uniquely positive light in 
spring practice, when nothing 
is open to public criticism and 
there’s no opponent just yet.

But 
Ruiz 
emerging 
into 

the full potential his 4-star 
recruit status indicated would 
be a step. Every offensive 
line needs an anchor. Ruiz 
appears headed firmly in that 
direction.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Sophomore center Cesar Ruiz looks poised to take over as “the quarterback of the O-Line,” according to Ed Warriner.

“He 

understands 
football very 

well.”

slotting the ball into the right 
side of the goal.

In an instant, Notre Dame 

(2-4 ACC, 7-6 overall) saw its 
lead cut down to just three. 
And for a second, the Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team (1-2 Big 
Ten, 5-8 Overall) looked like it 
had some momentum. 

But seconds later, it was 

gone.

Irish 
sophomore 
attacker 

Jessi 
Masinko 
drove 
from 

behind the net and deftly 
placed the ball in the bottom 
right corner of the goal. Thirty 
seconds 
later, 
midfielder 

Maddie Howe sprinted straight 
down the field and scored 
once more for Notre Dame. 
Following another goal, the 
Irish took a commanding 11-5 
lead into halftime. They would 
never relinquish that lead, 
winning the match, 14-8.

Notre Dame’s offense was 

extremely effective in the first 
half, notching 11 goals and 
controlling possession.

“Of 
all 
our 
games 
this 

season, they probably move 
the ball around the quickest,” 
said Michigan coach Hannah 
Nielsen. “They change the plan 
of attack really quickly, and 
every one of their seven players 
was an offensive threat.”

After 
halftime, 
the 

Wolverines appeared to settle 
in and play more comfortably at 
the game’s up-tempo pace.

“From top to bottom, in 

every aspect of it, it was just 
a 
really 
fast-paced 
game,” 

Nielsen said. “Notre Dame is an 
extremely athletic team; they 
were riding us hard, clearing 
the ball very fast, and they were 
really pushing the tempo. Once 
we settled in and realized it 
was just like any other game or 
any other practice, we started 
playing better.”

It was readily apparent that 

Michigan 
started 
executing 

better in the second half. 
Its offense was much more 
efficient, converting three of 
its seven shots. The goals came 
from junior attacker Adriana 
Pendino, 
fifth-year 
senior 

attacker Bianca Brueckner and 
Chandler Kirby.

The 
Wolverine 
defense 

showed 
improvement 
as 

well; it took the Irish nearly 
18 minutes to score their 
first goal of the second half. 
Notre 
Dame’s 
failure 
to 

convert scoring opportunities 
occurred 
in 
large 
part 

because of stellar goalkeeping 
by 
junior 
goalkeeper 
Alli 

Kothari. At halftime, Kothari 
replaced 
struggling 
junior 

goalkeeper Mira Shane, who 
was coming off a career-high 
14-save performance against 
Maryland.

“Unfortunately, Mira saw 

some really up-close shots 
in the first half and wasn’t 
getting her stick on them,” 
Nielsen said. “She had a tough 
day in the first half and we 
just needed to make a change. 
Fortunately for us, Alli came in 
and played great.”

Although Michigan’s second 

half 
improvements 
allowed 

it to keep up with the pace of 
the Irish — with a second-half 
score of 3-3 — the adjustments 
came too late.

“Unfortunately for us, it took 

a while for us to get used to that 
speed,” Nielsen said.

The one that got away

ST. PAUL, Minn. — Mel Pearson 

has said throughout the season that 
the name of the game is speed and 
grit.

The Michigan hockey team lived 

up to Pearson’s image for the team, 
but it would be Notre Dame that 
would emerge on top, as forward 
Jake Evans found the back of the 
net with 3.7 seconds remaining 
to send the Fighting Irish to the 
National Championship with a 4-3 
victory.

Even before puck drop, it was 

clear 
that 
the 
second-seeded 

Wolveirnes’ 
high-output, 
shifty 

offense would clash with No. 1 
Notre Dame’s (17-6-1 Big Ten, 27-9-
2 overall) juggernaut of a back line.

And Ohio State’s unpredicted loss 

at the hands of Minnesota-Duluth 
in the other semifinal matchup just 
an hour prior proved that playoff 
hockey is anyone’s game.

At the outset of Michigan’s (11-

10-3, 22-14-3) 25th Frozen Four 
appearance, junior forward Cooper 
Marody drew a whistle 34 seconds 

in for hooking to send the early 
momentum in the Fighting Irish’s 
favor.

After some dangerous looks at 

sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden 

Lavigne that yielded no fruit, it was 
evident that the Fighting Irish’s 
plethora of two-way players — 
exemplified by Evans, who had 11 
goals and a team-high 31 assists 
prior to the semifinal — were giving 
the Wolverine skaters considerable 
trouble.

But Michigan didn’t hold back 

either. 
Freshman 
defenseman 

Quinn Hughes drove down the ice 
with electric dangles and delivered 
a pass through the crease that just 
missed its mark.

But the Wolverines’ speed was 

the first to take the upper hand, as 
senior forward Tony Calderone 
drove into the slot to fire a shot past 
Cale Morris — who has a nation 
leading save-percentage at .945 — 
for the first tally of the game 8:19 
into the first period.

While Michigan continued to 

beat the Notre Dame defensemen 
with an aggressive forecheck and 
speed down the left side of the ice, 

the Fighting Irish kept generating 
odd-man rushes that all ended in 
acrobatic saves from Lavigne.

With 
Morris 
and 
Lavigne 

both notching nine saves in the 
first, there wasn’t much that 
differentiated both teams, only 
further securing the fact that the 
game would be won with sweat 
and, for one team, tears.

However, 17 seconds into the 

second period, senior forward 
Dexter 
Dancs 
disturbed 
that 

equality by firing a shot that 
ricocheted 
off 
Fighting 
Irish 

defenseman Dennis Gilbert up 
and over Morris’ glove to give the 
Wolverines a two-goal lead.

Notre Dame quickly retaliated 

twice, once on the man-advantage. 
After a holding penalty from junior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi, 

Fighting 
Irish 
center 
Andrew 

Oglevie let one fly from near the blue 
line that snuck past Lavigne to cut 
the Notre Dame deficit to one.

Evans 
subsequently 
found 

the equalizer at two apiece on a 
four-on-four one-timer off a dish 
from defenseman Jordan Gross. 
The Fighting Irish’s pressure — 

highlighted by its nine shots less 
than eight minutes into the second 
— was bound to yield something, 
and its best offensive performer 
simply lit the fuse.

“I think our game plan was to 

keep them off the power play,” 
Calderone said. “ … They played 
really well throughout the whole 
thing. I can’t say if we relaxed too 
much, they made some big plays.”

Outshooting Michigan, 15-7, in 

the second that returned two tallies, 
the Fighting Irish unmistakably 
won the second frame. But at 
the same time, the Wolverines 
dominated the first.

With the contest tied at two 

heading into the third period, it 
would be Notre Dame that would 
take the initial upper hand in the 
third, as forward Cal Burke drove 
down the left flank and snuck the 
puck past Lavigne’s left skate to give 
the Fighting Irish their first lead of 
the night, 3-2.

“Once we got behind, you saw the 

desperation that we needed to play 
with right from the start,” Pearson 
said.

But Michigan had its chance to 

reclaim the deficit on a power play 
8:15 into the period on a hooking 
call on Notre Dame forward Jack 
Jenkins but couldn’t seem to find 
its way past Morris on multiple 
dangerous chances.

And just as hopes began to 

dwindle, freshman forward Michael 
Pastujov answered the Wolverines’ 
prayers, as he punched the puck in 
off a scrum in front of the net with 
5:22 remaining in regulation.

“Yeah, it shows our depth,” 

Calderone said. “I think a lot of 
people, when they talk about us, talk 
about how we lack that depth, but a 
goal coming from Mike Pastujov like 
that just shows that … in the second 
half of the year we had all four lines 
going and that’s what got us here.”

In the end, though, just as 

postseason hockey games go, all it 
takes is one slim chance. Evans just 
happened to be the one to get that 
chance.

Wolverines fall, 4-3, to Notre Dame in heartbreaking Frozen Four semifinal

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

The Michigan hockey team gave up a late goal to Notre Dame to fall in the semifinals of the Frozen Four.

S

T. PAUL, Minn. — The 
adage goes, “You have to 
be good to be lucky.”

It’s 

unclear 
where it 
originated 
from, but 
that’s not 
really the 
point. 
Wherever 
it was first 
uttered, it 
might as 
well have 
come about specifically to 
describe the Michigan hockey 
team’s 2017-2018 season.

On Nov. 10, the Wolverines 

capped off their biggest win of 
the nascent Mel Pearson era 
by erasing a three-goal deficit 
to take down Minnesota in 
overtime. The winning goal 
was a Will Lockwood laser that 
deflected off of senior forward 
Alex Roos’ helmet and into 
the net — a “good” rally with a 
“lucky” ending.

On Feb. 18, Michigan led No. 

1 Notre Dame, 1-0, at Yost Ice 
Arena. With under a minute 
to play, Fighting Irish forward 
Andrew Oglevie pushed a shot 
behind sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne. The hockey 
gods themselves seemed to 
ensure the puck didn’t find 
twine, instead sending it all the 
way across the goalmouth and 
past the left post.

Lavigne made 35 mostly 

tremendous saves that day. If 
not for that lucky break, they 
might not have mattered at all. 
But he earned his good fortune, 
if you will.

The same thing happened 

in the NCAA Tournament 
Northeast Regional final. 
Boston’s Brandon Hickey 
whiffed at the puck in his zone, 
sophomore forward Jake Slaker 
snatched the loose change and 
rifled home a game-winning 
goal off a Terrier’s leg to send 
the Wolverines to the Frozen 
Four. Of course, Slaker’s hard-
nosed forecheck at the end of a 
shift made it all possible.

No team gets to the Frozen 

Four entirely by sheer luck. On 
the flip side, no team gets to the 
Frozen Four without any of it.

Michigan exemplified that all 

season. But so did Notre Dame.

Coming into the Frozen Four, 

the Fighting Irish had won four 
straight games by scoring in the 
final minute or overtime. Sure, 
they were ranked No. 1 or No. 2 
for basically the entire season. 
But those kind of runs don’t just 
happen.

Something was going to 

have to give, though. There 
were going to be bounces and 
bloopers Thursday night, and 
they were going to go one way 
or the other.

At first, it was the 

Wolverines that profited from 
them. Mere moments into the 
second period, senior forward 
Dexter Dancs skated into the 
circle and threw a puck at 
the net. It hit off Notre Dame 
defenseman Dennis Gilbert 
and into the net for a two-goal 
Michigan lead.

Probably not the way Dancs 

drew it up. But as anyone and 
everyone involved in hockey 
will tell you: get pucks to the net 
and good things will happen.

“(Assistant) coach (Bill) 

Muckalt says if the puck’s in the 
net — I don’t even know what it 
went off of,” Dancs said. “I was 
just trying to get a shot off … 
luckily it went in.”

But it didn’t do much to 

change the fact that the 
Fighting Irish were in total 
control. They had outshot the 
Wolverines, 7-4, to close the 

first period, and scored a power-
play goal in response just two 
minutes later.

It didn’t help that the bounces 

that had gone Michigan’s way 
at first had stopped coming. 
But Notre Dame thoroughly 
controlled the second period 
regardless.

“Our game plan was keep 

them off the power play,” Dancs 
said. “And we gave them a 
power play, and they scored off 
of it.”

Single-elimination 

postseason hockey is a 
crapshoot, due in no small 
part to goaltending. As the 
Wolverines began to seize 
momentum midway through the 
third period, Morris was simply 
everywhere for the Fighting 
Irish, spreading out all across 
the crease and denying waves of 
grade-A chances.

Even an average goaltender 

can catch fire and carry his 
team through a game. But 
Morris is no average goaltender. 
He’s the Big Ten Player of the 
Year and a Hobey Baker Award 
finalist, and Thursday was just 
another night at the office.

With five minutes to play, 

freshman forward Mike 
Pastujov slashed one past 
Morris to tie the game at 
three. Pastujov had two golden 
opportunities denied in the 
previous 30 seconds alone. At 
that moment, it almost seemed 
inevitable — Michigan had to 
break through at some point. 
The Wolverines had to obtain a 
fortunate rebound somewhere.

Pearson and his team were 

well aware of Notre Dame’s 
unbelievable success in the 
clutch. They had seen Dylan 
Malmquist’s overtime winner 
against Michigan Tech, were 
familiar with Jack Jenkins’ 
clincher against Providence.

But how do you prepare to 

stop the luck of the Irish, even 
if you can sense it coming?

Michigan had one last 

chance to win it in regulation, 
but the puck was knocked away 
with 11 seconds to go. Fighting 
Irish forward Cam Morrison 
took the stretch pass from his 
own zone, flew down the left 
flank and laced a pass into the 
middle. Jake Evans was on the 
receiving end, tied to Quinn 
Hughes’ hip.

“Just a bad bounce there at 

the end,” Pearson said.

Evans got his stick on the 

puck, and it trickled under 
Lavigne’s pads. Twenty players 
in blue hung their heads.

On the bench, Pearson had 

already been thinking ahead to 
overtime.

“Last goal we weren’t too 

concerned,” he said. “Just a 
basic two-on-two. I give them 
credit, they made a good play, 
drove it wide and threw it in 
the crease.

“Tough way to lose… I don’t 

know if there’s any easy way to 
lose.”

Notre Dame was the better 

team on Thursday night. It 
controlled the flow for longer 
stretches, and Morris outplayed 
Lavigne. And in the end, the 
Fighting Irish got the break 
they needed to advance to the 
national championship.

Dancs joined Pearson and 

senior forward Tony Calderone 
in the bowels of the Xcel 
Energy Center, cheeks painted 
scarlet by tears. As he choked 
out some final words about his 
senior season, this much was 
clear:

Good, lucky — at this point, 

none of it mattered.

The good, the bad and the unlucky

Season-long inconsistencies plague Michigan

ST PAUL, Minn. — It could be 

called “The Luck of the Irish.”

With 5.2 seconds remaining 

in 
regulation, 
Notre 
Dame 

forward Jake Evans pushed the 
puck five-hole past sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne to 
end the Michigan hockey team’s 
unexpected NCAA Tournament 
run right then and there.

But more than luck were 

inconsistencies 
in 
play 

throughout 
the 
national 

semifinal game 
that led to a 4-3 
heartbreaking 
loss 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
on 

Thursday night 
at 
the 
Xcel 

Energy Center.

Michigan 

reached the Frozen Four on 
Lavigne’s 
solid 
goaltending, 

timely scoring from secondary 
players and an explosive first 
line of senior forwards Dexter 
Dancs and Tony Calderone and 
junior forward Cooper Marody.

However, the story of the year 

for the Wolverines has been an 
inability to capitalize on the 
power play and step up on the 
penalty kill — ranked fourth-
worst in the country, stopping 
just 75.33 percent of opponent’s 
man advantages. Michigan was 
unable to reverse the trends, 
leading to costly miscues and 
missed opportunities to put the 
game away for good.

With 
an 
extra 
week 
of 

preparation before the Frozen 
Four, 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson slowed down practice 
to specifically focus on special 
teams. Against a Fighting Irish 
power play that was successful 
on 
22.83 
percent 
of 
their 

opportunities, the Wolverines 
needed to be the aggressors to 
stifle chances.

After quickly killing a penalty 

just 34 seconds into the first 
period, it appeared Michigan’s 
Achilles heel was solved. After 
scoring two unanswered goals 
early, one from Dancs and 

another 
from 
Calderone, 
it 

appeared the Wolverines were 
in complete control.

But that was when Notre 

Dame began to strike. After a 
two-minute 
holding 
penalty 

to junior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi, Fighting Irish forward 
Andrew 
Oglevie 
unloaded 

a 
slapshot 
from 
the 
point 

that passed Lavigne to cut 
Michigan’s lead in half and 
breathe life into a dormant 
Notre Dame offense.

Minutes later, 

with both teams 
down 
a 
man 

and 
four-on-

four play, Evans 
found 
open 

space 
between 

the circles with 
no maize and 
blue sweaters in 
sight and fired 
a one-timer into 
the back of the 

net to knot the game at two 
goals apiece.

“We’ve been much better 

lately,” Pearson said. “(Senior 
defenseman 
Sam) 
Piazza 

blocked that shot, so we had to 
recover because he on the ice. 
That opened some things up 
and they had a seeing-eye shot 
there.”

After 
relinquishing 
a 

third straight Fighting Irish 
tally at the beginning of the 
third period, the Wolverines 
found themselves in a do-or-
die 
situation, 
pressing 
to 

tie the game and keep their 
tournament journey afloat.

With 8:15 to go in the final 

frame, 
Michigan 
had 
its 

opening. Handed their third 
power play opportunity of the 
evening, 
following 
a 
Notre 

Dame hooking penalty, the 
Wolverines 
had a chance to 
respond.

But for a team 

that has struggled 
mightily with the 
man 
advantage 

all season long, 
ranked 
33rd 

in 
the 
nation 

with 
an 
18.37 

percent 
success 

rate, 
Michigan 

couldn’t answer. A forceful 
Fighting 
Irish 
penalty 
kill 

squashed all the Wolverines’ 
chances to advance to the 
national championship game 
against Minnesota-Duluth.

“We’ve got to get better with 

that next year, there’s no doubt 
about it,” Pearson said. “And we 
will.”

Michigan may get better on 

special teams next season, but 
at this point, it doesn’t really 
matter.

Goals from Calderone and 

Dancs helped the Wolverines 
take the lead early, just as the 
“DMC” line has done all season. 
Twenty-five saves on 29 shots 
from Lavigne kept Michigan 
in the game late. A goal from 
freshman 
forward 
Michael 

Pastujov with 5:22 remaining 
gave the Wolverines a last 

chance.

But 

Thursday 
night, 
it 

wasn’t enough 
to 
propel 

Michigan 
to 

the 
national 

championship 
game. Season-
long problems 
again haunted 
the Wolverines 

and this time, it ended their 
season for good. What looked 
like a game Michigan had for 
the taking slowly turned into a 
repeat of the struggles seen all 
year.

The lucky bounce at the 

game’s end wasn’t the deciding 
factor. It was what came before 
that.
