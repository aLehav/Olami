The Ann Arbor community 

reacted negatively to President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
executive 

order banning the travel and 
resettlement of citizens from 
seven Muslim-majority countries 
to the United States that was 
issued last Friday. 

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor issued a statement on his 
Facebook page Sunday afternoon 
condemning the actions of the 
Trump administration thus far, 
saying people must stand up and 
fight the president’s harmful 
policies.

“Trump and his supporters 

have polluted something beautiful 

— the honor of the United States 
and its people,” Taylor wrote. 
“The world looking in, ourselves 
looking about us, we must now 
reasonably question the continued 
truth of that reputation. Are we 
in fact a decent and just people? 
Is the United States of America a 
force for good? Do we as a people 
have the courage to try to make 
the world a better place, or are 
we debilitated by weakness and 
fear?”

Taylor went on to say Ann Arbor 

was committed to protecting the 
constitutional rights of its citizens 
and all Americans. He mentioned 
questions of citizenship would not 
hinder this commitment, hinting 
at Trump’s most recent executive 
order.

Researchers at the University 

of Michigan will be using big 
data — large data sets that need 
to be computationally analyzed 
— to predict when individuals 
will be affected by diseases 
like depression and Hepatitis 
C. Big data will also be used to 
understand the applications of 
single-cell gene sequencing — 
examining genetic information 
from individual cells — through 
three projects that were recently 
funded.

The three projects, M-CHAMP, 

the Michigan Center for Single-
Cell Genomic Data Analysis and 
the Intern Health Study, are 
receiving $3 million in funding 
from the Michigan Institute 
for Data Science as part of the 
Challenge Initiatives Program, 
which challenges data scientists 
and other research investigators 
to solve real-world problems in 
areas of transportation research, 
learning analytics, social sciences 
and health sciences. The program 
is part of the University’s plan to 
invest $100 million in Data Science 
Initiatives 
and 
infrastructure, 

which 
was 
announced 
in 

September 2015.

Brahmajee 
Nallamothu 
is 

leading the Michigan Center for 
Health Analytics and Medical 
Prediction project, which includes 
research investigators from LSA, 
the College of Engineering, the 
School of Nursing, the School of 
Public Health and the Medical 

School.

Nallamothu noted the goal 

of all three projects was to help 
researchers understand the vast 
amounts of data that were spread 
throughout multiple disciplines.

“The big goals of all the 

projects, in my opinion, are to 
help us start to make sense of all 
the information that is currently 
surrounding us in a diverse set 
of fields,” Nallamothu said. “The 
stakes are really high for us to 
succeed, because these new tools 
can be transformational across 
all these areas: social sciences, 
health, 
transportation 
and 

learning analytics.”

M-CHAMP focuses on two 

areas: acute lung injury following 
critical 
illness 
and 
chronic 

Hepatitis 
C 
virus 
infection. 

Nallamothu 
explained, 
while 

there are current ongoing studies 
trying to predict the outcomes 
of 
patients, 
they 
aren’t 
as 

comprehensive and complex as 
M-CHAMP.

“Currently, most studies take 

a ‘snapshot’ view of how patients 
are doing to predict how they will 
do in the future,” Nallamothu 
said. “Longitudinal data that is 
collected over time often goes 
ignored because of the complexity 
of including all of this information 
into statistical models. We want to 
change that and help improve our 

ability to predict how patients will 
do over time.”

The 
Michigan 
Center 
for 

Single-Cell 
Genomic 
Data 

Analysis, 
another 
project 

receiving 
University 
funding, 

analyzes 
single-cell 
genomics 

data. The group will use this 
information 
in 
applications 

concerning 
cancer 
and 
cell 

development.

This 
team 
of 
researchers 

come from LSA, College of 
Engineering, School of Public 
Health, the Medical School, the 
Department of Computational 
Medicine 
and 
Bioinformatics 

and the Comprehensive Cancer

its 
first 
non-

afternoon in front of a crowd 
of over 200 students, faculty 
and local businesspeople at the 
Stamps Auditorium on North

The competition, began at 

the beginning of the month 
with a series of auditions of 
more than 40 student startups 
pitching to the Center for 
Entrepreneurship. 
Only 
13 

teams made it through to the

to win the final cash prize of 
more than $15,000 in funding 
for their startup. The projects 
range from all different fields, 
but the majority are based on 
development of technology and 
software.

Hundreds marched from the Diag to the Federal Building on East Liberty in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Friday night. There have been numerous 
protests nationwide in response to President Donald Trump’s policy decisions, including his executive order on immigration over the weekend.

Airports across the nation fill with demonstrations in response to Trump legislation

Nearly 5,000 people took over 

the Detroit Metropolitan Airport 
international terminal Sunday 
afternoon to protest President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
executive 

order 
preventing 
individuals 

from certain Muslim-majority 
countries from entering the U.S. 
Attendees stopped lanes of traffic 
and filled the terminal, chanting: 
“Let them in” and “This is what 
democracy looks like.”

Organizers from the Michigan 

Muslim 
Community 
Council 

and the Michigan chapter of the 
Women’s March on Washington 

arranged the protest in under 24 
hours, joining similar movements 
at airports across the country 
over the weekend.

Trump’s order, signed on Friday, 

severely restricts immigration 
from 
seven 
Muslim-majority 

countries 
including 
Yemen, 

Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya 
and Syria for 90 days, suspends 

all refugee resettlement for 120 
days and bans Syrian refugees 
indefinitely. A New York federal 
judge — who is also a University of 
Michigan alum — overturned part 
of the ban Saturday evening to 
allow travelers currently detained 
at airports into the country.

Thirty students performed a 

play in rememberance of the 1969 
racial riots in Malaysia as part 
of the eighth annual Malaysian 
Cultural Night on Sunday night, 
which also the celebrated the 
Lunar New Year.

The play, written by Ross 

sophomore 
Jeevan 
Netraaj 

Singh, tells the story of a 
Chinese boy named Lee who 
was orphaned because of the 
race riots. Throughout the plot 
of the play, he develops a deep 
resentment for Malays, blaming 
them for the death of his mother, 
but his feelings of hatred change 
when he is eventually adopted by 
a Malay family. 

LSA junior Aifa Muhammad 

Radzi, the publicity director of 
the Malaysian Cultural Night 
Board, explained the topic of the 
race riots is generally avoided in 
Malaysian schools.

“Why we highlight it in the 

play is that we don’t actually 
talk about it a lot in Malaysian 
history classes,” Radzi said. “In 
Malaysia, it’s still considered a 
sensitive topic.”

In the city of Detroit, 

everybody gets a slice.

Detroit ranked number five 

on Tasting Table’s list of “The 

9 Best Cities for Pizza Lovers.” 

New York City and Brooklyn 

came in first and second, 

respectively.

According to the website, 

Detroit-style pizza is 

characterized by its rectangular 

shape and abundance of crust. 

Notable pizza joints mentioned 

in the article are Amar Pizza, 

Loui’s Pizza and Pepe Z’s. 

A Detroit Free Press article 

about the rating notes that 

Detroit was also named a 

top travel destination by the 

New York Times and a top 

“unexpected” food city by 

National Geographic, both for 

2017.

Eater Detroit’s online map 

of “The Essential Metro Detroit 

Pizzerias” also mentions the 

city’s iconic Neapolitan round 

pizza and its own New York 

style. Niki’s Pizza, located in 

Bricktown — a neighborhood 

of Detroit — is described as an 

exemplar of the city’s deep dish. 

PizzaPapalis, a Metro Detroit 

chain, is known for its Chicago-

style deep dish, according to 

the article. Supino Pizzeria, a 

family-owned diner in the heart 

of Eastern Market, is known 

for its New York style. The 

restaurant was also featured on 

an episode of Food Network’s hit 

TV show, “Diners, Drive-Ins and 

Dives.” Guy Fieri — restaurateur 

and host of the show — said his 

favorite Supino pizza was the 

“City Wing Thing,” complete 

with smoked turkey, cherry 

peppers and garlic.

Over 
80 
people 
gathered 

inside the Michigan Union Rogel 
Ballroom Friday night to listen to 
Matt Gallagher, former U.S. Army 
Captain and critically acclaimed 
author, recount his experiences 
in the Iraq War as a part of the 
8th Annual Student Veterans 
of America at the University of 

Michigan Benefit Dinner.

Student Veterans of America 

is a non-profit organization on 
campus aiding veterans with 
resources they need at higher 
education institutions, as well as 
after graduation. The group has 
chapters at almost 1,500 schools 
across the country, and has 
supported more than 500,000 
student veterans.

During the event, Gallagher 

read passages from his novel, 
“Youngblood,” as well as personal 
essays detailing his youth and 
experiences 
during 
the 
war. 

He spoke of the importance of 
continuing to tell stories, and how 
they can shape the future of the 
United States.

“Whether you’re an aspiring 

writer or going into business or 
going to be a dentist, we’re all 
storytellers,” Gallagher said. “It’s 

a way of giving back to our 
families, to our communities, 
to American society at large, to 
help understand the past and 
maybe, to help shape the future 
for the better.”

Gallagher 
commented 

numerous times on the strong 
national 
reputation 
of 
the 

Student Veterans of America 
chapter at the University.

Business senior Jonathan 

Chen, 
President 
of 
the 

SVAUM, said after serving 
nearly four years in the 
Marine Corps, he felt very 
welcomed by the Student 
Veterans of America. Chen 
described 
the 
hardships 

veterans face when they enter 
into a university setting, and 
explained how the group 
works to make the transition 
as smooth as possible.

“We say there’s really three 

big things: the professional, 
the social and the academic,” 
Chen said. “If you really think 
about it, somebody coming 
into college, like the normal 
way, you have an 18-year-
old, it’s kinda hard — hard 
to adjust, hard to find weird 
places, all that kind of stuff. 
When you put all that, class 
itself is hard, but then being a 
veteran and coming out of four 
to eight to 12 to 20 years in the 
military, some with multiple 
combat deployments, some 
with kids, some with husbands 
or wives, then putting school on 
top of that — it’s extremely hard.

outside the terminal a stream 
of people spontaneously joined 
from cars driving by and some 
travelers even delayed their 
flights to participate. The crowd 
then packed the entire arrivals 
area inside the terminal for 
a rally led by elected officials 
and 
local 
activists. 
Rep. 

Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) told 
protesters their activism — in 
addition to legal action — was a 
key component in overturning 
Trump’s ban.

“We are trying to introduce 

legislation that will overturn 
the executive order,” she said 
to cheers from the crowd. 
“This is not about Republican 
or Democrat, we are here as 
Americans. There is no one 
who doesn’t care about national 
security … but we are standing 
for 
fundamental 
rights 
in 

the Constitution: freedom of 
religion, freedom of speech.”

Residents 
of 
cities 
with 

high concentrations of Muslim 
immigrants, like Dearborn and 
Hamtramck, 
also 
protested 

Sunday 
afternoon. 
Michigan 

hosts 
the 
second-highest 

population of Syrian refugees 
in the country, but resettlement 
programs across the state may 
be forced to close in light of the 
ban.

LSA freshman Ayah Kutmah, 

a 
first-generation 
Syrian 

American, 
said 
the 
protest 

allayed much of the anxiety she 
felt after the executive order, 
despite her relatives’ inability to 
join her in the United States.

“My family is devastated, 

but I don’t like to think of (the 
ban) as indefinite,” she said. 
“I have so much hope today, 

and I honestly think the more 
we show support like this for 
refugees 
and 
immigrants, 

the more representatives will 
listen.”

Elected officials attending 

the event included Dingell, Rep. 
Brenda Lawrence (D–Mich.), 
and Michigan Reps. Abdullah 
Hammoud 
(D–Dearborn), 

Yousef Rabhi (D–Ann Arbor) 
and Jim Ellison (D–Royal Oak). 
Rabhi condemned Trump and 
called for more representatives 
to fight for the protection of 
vulnerable citizens.

“This is fighting for the 

America we all love and fighting 
against 
an 
oppressive 
man 

who is now the president of the 
United States and pushing a neo-
fascist agenda,” he said. “My role 
is standing up every day for the 
refugees seeking safety in our 
country, for everyone who wants 
to make America home.” 

Waving to a line of cars 

honking 
on 
the 
airport 

concourse, state Rep. Rashida 
Tlaib 
(D–Detroit) 
paused 

chanting 
to 
criticize 
the 

“hypocrisy” of the ban.

“My family fled their homes 

overseas because of these kinds 
of policies, and now they’ll have 
to fight them here,” she said. 
“Here, now, though, I’m proud 
to be an American today.” 

Both University of Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel and 
Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor 
released 
statements 

this 
weekend 
promising 
to 

protect 
international 
and 

undocumented 
community 

members. Schlissel’s refusal to 
release information on students’ 
immigration statuses was one 
of a handful of statements 
from universities and colleges 
over the weekend affirming a 
commitment to international 
students. Taylor, too, stood in 

solidarity with immigrants and 
refugees, even accusing Trump 
and his supporters of having 
“polluted” the country’s honor.

Nursing senior Matt White 

applauded 
the 
University’s 

statement at the protest and 
pushed for even more action.

“I was very proud to see our 

University stand up on this 
issue,” he said. “But we need to 
work to protect all immigrants 
— students, faculty and staff — 
not just students.”

History 
Prof. 
Heather 

Thompson agreed, citing the 
protest’s place in a history of 
resistance 
against 
policies 

limiting 
immigrants’ 
rights. 

Amid chants of “no Trump, 
no KKK, no fascist USA,” 
Thompson warned of history 
repeating itself.

“The 
American 
people 

who 
care 
about 
refugees, 

immigrants, 
democracy 
and 

freedom are not going to put up 
with this and they never did,” 
she said. “They didn’t in the ’20s, 
they didn’t in the ’30s, not in the 
’50s and they’re not going to do it 
now. I remind Americans we’ve 
been here before, and fascism 
happens slowly when we don’t 
stand up.” 

Protest organizers connected 

Sunday’s action to a slew of other 
issues — most notably Trump’s 
order of a wall on the Mexican 
border — and assured larger and 
more coordinated campaigns 
were 
on 
the 
way. 
MMCC 

organizer 
Fatima 
Salman 

pointed 
to 
the 
immediate 

response the protest garnered 
from community members.

“Every community has joined 

along in the last day and we as a 
Metro Detroit community are 
a strong and unified front,” she 
said. “Refugees are welcome here, 
and they’ve always been welcome 
here and they always will be.”

The third project, the Intern 

Health Study, headed by Srijan 
Sen, a psychiatry professor, will be 
using data collected from mobile 
applications from over 1,000 
medical interns to determine the 
relationships between circadian 
rhythms, mood and sleep, as 
well as how they might lead to 
depression.

Sen 
explained 

the goal of the project is to find 
patterns that lead to depression so 
measures can be taken to identify 
at-risk individuals and provide 
treatment.

“Largely, the goal of the 

study is to capture data about 
people’s sleep, activity, their 
cardiac function and where 
they’re going, so we can predict 
before people really descend 
into the depths of depression 
that people are at risk in the 
first part,” Sen said. “The second 
part is to come up with some 
kinds of intervention to prevent 
depression.”

Alfred 
Hero, 
a 
professor 

of electrical engineering and 

computer 
science 
and 
the 

co-director of Michigan Institute 
for 
Data 
Science, 
explained 

the efficiency of the groups in 
analyzing big data stems from 
the fact that they are composed 
of so many different disciplines.

“All of the projects funded 

by MIDAS are funded in a very 
multidisciplinary manner and 
that’s where you can make 
progress on these problems, 
because it’s not just looking at 
biological processes and how 
to sample cells and how to do 
sequencing,” Hero said. “It’s 
really how do you analyze that 
data to be able to segment the 
population into these classes 
of susceptibility.”

The riots are viewed by 

many Malaysians as a dark 
spot in the country’s history. A 
racial divide between Chinese 
and Malays developed, which 
was intensified by the 1969 
Malaysian 
general 
election. 

After the election, many angered 
Malaysians attacked members of 
the Chinese-dominated majority 
party, as well as many civilians. 
The casualties of the riots were 

predominantly Chinese.

Singh, 
the 
director 
of 

Malaysian 
Cultural 
Night, 

echoed Radzi’s statements and 
said he felt some Malaysian 
people in his community felt 
uncomfortable with his choice 
of topic.

“Even when I was writing 

this play, I felt some resistance 
from some fellow Malaysians 
that did not want me to go 
through with this because they 
thought there were so many 
other aspects of Malaysian 
history I could talk about,” 
Singh said. 

Singh said he chose to write a 

play about the racial riots because 
he felt they were important to 
discuss and remember. When 
writing the play, he wanted to 
depict how Malaysia is truly 
an 
integration 
of 
different 

cultures. Singh’s play featured 
a traditional Malaysian dance, 
as well as a Chinese Umbrella 
Dance and Bhangra, a traditional 
dance 
originating 
from 

India, to represent Malaysia’s 
multicultural society.

who later decided whether or 
not they wanted to advise and 
nurture the startup into a full-
fledged company. The Startup 
Competition 
advertised 
its 

event as being similar to the 
reality television show “The 
Voice,” as the panel of four 
judges began facing away from 
the contestants and turned 
around only when they wanted 
to add a contestant to their 
coterie of startups.

Sonali Vijayavargiya was one 

of the judges at the event as the 
founder and managing director 
of Augment Ventures, a firm 
that 
invests 
in 
technology 

and software companies. She 
said the Startup Competition 
provides not only a chance for 
industry leaders to identify 
budding 
companies, 
but 
to 

serve in mentorship roles.

“We 
are 
taking 
the 

investment 
background 
that 

we have and bringing it to the 
students so that they can build 
new businesses,” Vijayavargiya 
said. “I am really looking for 
opportunity as you know when 
I look at the new enterprises, I 
really like to see what kind of a 
problem they’re solving, what 
kind of a need they’re meeting 

and what it takes, what kind of 
technology and people, it takes 
to get to that point.”

Vijayavargiya was the first 

judge to turn around following 
the pitch and partner with a 
startup by the name of Cheruvu, 
which 
advertises 
itself 
as 

“Big Data for Small Farmers.” 
The team is made up of three 
graduate students who aim to 
build resilient and sustainable 
villages 
by 
employing 
data 

science to improve the decisions 
of small farmers.

ForzaMetrix was the first 

startup that had two judges 
turn around and vie for its 
stewardship. 
ForzaMetrix, 

whose three team members 
have experience in business, 
engineering and law, pitched 
itself 
as 
a 
company 
that 

can 
help 
optimize 
athletic 

performance through the use of 
workout tracking sensors and 
analytics. Both Scott Taylor, of 
the Michigan Small Business 
Development 
Council, 
and 

Jake Cohen, of Detroit Venture 
Partners, attempted to compel 
ForzaMetrix to enlist their 
mentorship. 

Taylor sold his company by 

highlighting how he feels he 
can help ForzaMetrix build 
a customer base, but Cohen 
rebutted by extolling his firm’s 
connections 
to 
professional 

sports teams and entertainment 

companies.

“(Detroit Venture Partners) 

has a lot of connections in the 
sports and entertainment world, 
as I work for Dan Gilbert, who 
owns the Cleveland Cavaliers,” 
Cohen said. “I would love to 
work with you.”

ForzaMetrix ultimately sided 

with Cohen.

One of the companies that 

elicited a quick turn of the chair 
was Find Your Ditto, an online 
service that aims to connect 
peoples who live with chronic 
illnesses and build support 
networks among its members.

Parisa Soraya, a master’s 

student of health informatics, 
said seeing Cohen turn around 
in his chair and select her as 
someone he wanted to mentor 
was an exciting experience.

“It was very relieving to 

be selected because you only 
have a minute and we had to 
figure out how to best present 
the venture quickly and to get 
someone interested,” Soraya 
said. “It was really nice, as 
Jake was our top choice and it 
worked out.”

Five more startups were 

chosen by the panelists, with 
the 
seven 
teams, 
such 
as 

Pakochi, Air Mail and FUNL, 
being left behind and unable to 
advance to the next round. The 
second round of the Startup 
Competition will be on Feb. 10.

Michigan has one of the 

highest numbers of refugees in 
the country, with over 2,000 
Syrian refugees and 8,015 refugees 
in total. Ann Arbor is often 
considered a “sanctuary city,” 
meaning the city’s police can 
only enforce immigration laws in 
criminal circumstances.

“Ann 
Arbor 
affirms 
the 

principles and hard fought rights 
enshrined in our Constitution,” 
Taylor wrote. “Among these rights 
are freedom of movement and the 
right to be free from unreasonable 
search and seizure. We will protect 
and honor these rights. We will 
not stop the innocent and demand 
to see their papers. We will 
confront the criminal and protect 
the innocent, without regard to 
citizenship 
or 
documentation. 

Count on it.”

The University of Michigan 

community has also been vocal 
in its opposition of the executive 
order. While President Schlissel 
wrote on Saturday that the 
University would not release the 
immigration status information 

of its students, a national petition 
gained traction among staff and 
faculty.

Titled 
“Academics 
Against 

Immigration Executive Order,” 
the petition is a platform for 
academics from across the country 
to denounce the order on the 
grounds that it is discriminatory, 
places an undue burden on those 
affected and hinders academic 
progress in the nation.

“The 
(Executive 
Order) 

significantly damages American 
leadership in higher education 
and research … From Iran alone, 
more than 3000 students have 
received PhDs from American 
universities in the past 3 years,” 
a clause of the petition reads. 
“The 
proposed 
EO 
limits 

collaborations with researchers 
from these nations by restricting 
entry of these researchers to 
the US and can potentially lead 
to departure of many talented 
individuals who are current 
and 
future 
researchers 
and 

entrepreneurs in the US. We 
strongly believe the immediate 
and long term consequences of 
this EO do not serve our national 
interests.”

Over 4,000 professors and 

academics 
had 
signed 
their 

names to the petition by Sunday 
morning, and over 60 of those 
names come from University 
professors and graduate students.

History Prof. John Carson said 

he found out about the petition 
earlier this weekend and signed 
it immediately. He told the Daily 
he felt the executive order was an 
attack on not only his personal 
values and those that the nation 
was built upon, but also to 
universities worldwide.

“It 
will 
have 
effects 
on 

the 
international 
scope 
of 

universities,” Carson said. “You 
can imagine this closing of 
the movement of people, and 
eventually the movement of ideas 
in the end.”

Carson’s fear of what this new 

immigration policy might bring 
is echoed in the final lines of the 
petition. 

“The 
unethical 
and 

discriminatory 
treatment 
of 

law-abiding, hard-working and 
well-integrated 
immigrants 

fundamentally 
contravenes 

the founding principles of the 
United States,” the petition 
reads. “We strongly denounce 
this ban and urge the President 
to reconsider going forward 
with this Executive Order.”

hichijima 
is 
a 
small, 

desolate 
rock 
island 

located in the south Pacific 

and in 1944, it was 
home to a Japanese 
Naval 
installation 

that was subject to 
frequent attacks by 
American warplanes. 
On Aug. 1 of that year, 
a 
young 
lieutenant 

was piloting a torpedo 
bomber that was shot 
down a few miles from 
the island. He escaped 
by parachute out of 
his plane, landed in the 
water, made it onto a raft and began 
drifting toward the Japanese 
island, which was known for its 
cruel treatment of its prisoners 
and confirmed cannibalism. He 
was eventually rescued by a small 
American submarine, and his 
war career, this terrifying event 
included, would prove to be crucial 
in the shape and formation of the 
politician he would become later 
in life. 

Former 
President 
George 

Herbert Walker Bush enlisted 
as a fighter pilot to liberate 
the oppressed from the Axis 
powers. This struggle against 
blind nationalism and radical 
policies continued all his life. 
His presidency was not defined 
by conservatism or profound 
Republican ideology, but instead, 
his administration was moderate 
and pragmatic, working toward a 
common goal with the other side 
of the aisle.

I recently finished reading Jon 

Meacham’s “Destiny and Power,” 
the 2015 biography on Bush, 
which details these struggles with 
radicals utilizing nationalism both 
home and abroad. His political 
battles later in life cost him his 
presidency. 
He 
raised 
taxes 

despite 
the 
uncompromising 

nature of the far right, enacted 
legislation for minorities and the 
disabled despite pushback from 
staunch conservatives and most 
importantly, he convinced the 
nation not to hide behind guns 
and patriotism in the face of a 
foreign danger and simultaneously 
demonstrated when, where and 
how military force is necessary to 
solve a crisis.

Bush 
had 
seen 
how 
the 

nationalism of Nazi Germany and 
Imperial Japan were disguises the 
public bought into, allowing for the 
heinous governments to proceed 
with truly evil policy. Therefore, 
he refused to submit to the blind 
nationalism to which many within 
his party fell prey. His ability 
to place country over party was 
essential in ending the Cold War 

with the Soviet Union. Yet, this 
all contributed to him losing his 
re-election in 1992. Following his 

defeat, the Republican 
Party 
allowed 
for 

its radical right to 
grow 
louder 
and 

stronger, 
preaching 

blind nationalism to 
its 
uncompromising 

followers. His eldest 
son’s 
administration 

and the Republican 
Party in opposition 
to former President 
Barack Obama further 

contributed 
to 
the 

growth of the dangerous ideology 
that was once the party of George 
H.W. Bush. 

All of this culminated in the 

swearing in of our Celebrity 
President, Donald Trump, who in 
his “American carnage” speech 
touted the same nationalist and 
populist rhetoric that has been 
heard before in the past. A man 
many feared for already displaying 
authoritarian tendencies during 
his 
campaign 
and 
transition 

period, whether it be refusing to 
remove himself from his many 
business interests or condemning 
and silencing members of the 
press, gave an inaugural address 
that stated, “When you open your 
heart to patriotism, there is no 
room for prejudice.”

His administration has begun 

on a note of authoritarians using 
nationalism and love of one’s 
country to mask injustices and 
to start a campaign against 
the free American media. His 
press 
secretary 
Sean 
Spicer 

lambasted the press over the most 
insignificant of issues — that the 
size of his inauguration crowd 
was actually larger than reported. 
His counselor Kellyanne Conway 
then further dragged America 
into 
George 
Orwell’s 
“1984” 

with her argument that Spicer 
was simply offering “alternative 
facts.” And finally, the president’s 
chief strategist Stephen Bannon 
said the media should “keep 
its mouth shut.” “You’re the 
opposition party,” he said. “Not 
the Democratic Party. You’re the 
opposition party. The media’s the 
opposition party.”

This is all occurring as part of 

the Trump “movement,” which 
incorporates 
the 
populism, 

nationalism 
and 
isolationism 

once seen generations before. 
America has used nationalism 
to write the darker chapters of 
our history. “Sea to shining sea” 
required the genocide of an entire 
race of people. The heroic fight 
against communism allowed for 
McCarthyism and the buildup of 

deadly nuclear arsenals. And the 
flags flying after 9/11 hid our eyes 
from a government that tortured 
fellow human beings.

This devotion to the star-

spangled awesomeness of America 
will likely only grow because 
President Trump is also proposing 
a “Day of Patriotic Devotion:” 
a day of common proclamation 
and devotion to our country. This 
new holiday relates to the section 
of his inauguration speech when 
he stated, “At the bedrock of our 
politics will be a total allegiance to 
the United States of America, and 
through our loyalty to our country, 
we will rediscover our loyalty to 
each other.”

Many believe that 21st-century 

America 
would 
never 
allow 

a fascist to emerge and abuse 
power like the demagogues of 
the previous century. Many of us 
read only of the incomprehensible 
levels of violence of wars of the 
past, wondering how such people 
allowed for that to happen. We’ve 
been buffered from the violence of 
the world and fooled with money 
and easy lives into believing that it 
will never happen again.

Yet we have elected a TV 

celebrity 
who 
demonstrates 

that he has an unpredictable, 
scattered 
and 
egotistical 

personality, and is vengeful to 
the point of trivialness against 
all his enemies. We have allowed 
this man to surround himself 
with sycophants and spineless 
politicians who are so readily 
willing to submit to his childish 
will. And we have already 
allowed 
this 
administration 

to begin lying to us, to begin 
utilizing the nationalism and 
populism that drove its campaign 
to govern the country.

President George H.W. Bush 

once stated that people must 
caution themselves from “suicidal 
nationalism.” 
He 
understood 

the threats posed by such blind 
ideologies that promote populist 
and dangerous leaders. He nearly 
died fighting against a nation that 
fell victim to it. And he understood 
that some things were greater 
than your job or your political 
party. One of them was never 
to bend to the will of the blind 
patriotism so ingrained within 
the radical ideology. And now, 
in 2017, America is faced with a 
presidential administration posing 
similar tendencies to those of 
autocratic regimes blanketed in a 
love for one’s country.

T

he weekend of Jan. 21, I 
attended the Women’s 
March in Washington, 

D.C. and was lucky enough to be 
surrounded by over 500,000 like-
minded, 
democratically 
active 

citizens. Legions of pink hats and 
clever signs overtook the National 
Mall in downtown Washington. 
I felt empowered and powerful 
in spite of the previous day’s 
inauguration of our new president. 
After the march had finished, 
reports marveled at the lack of 
arrests. While many women took 
this as a sign of peacefulness and 
respect, others raised concerns 
about the racial implications of this 
phenomenon, especially in light of 
racially charged police aggression 
in the recent past.

The 
perception 
of 
“a 

harmlessness 
white 
woman” 

pervaded the march, and police 
officers wearing pink pussy hats 
and shouting affirmations of safety 
and love at marchers were signs 
of this racial bias. The successful 
peacefulness of the Women’s 
March is certainly positive, but 
it is critical that white women 
recognize the privilege we 
have and apply that to our role 
in activism.

A lot of march attendees took 

to social media, claiming that this 
event was “just the beginning” 
of 
modern 
political 
activism. 

However, while many of these 
injustices feel new to many of 
the white women who attended 
(myself 
included), 
feelings 
of 

political inequality have long been 
a reality for minority communities.

The 
importance 
of 

representational 
diversity 

in the realm of political and 
social 
activism 
cannot 
be 

understated. 
The 
University 

of Michigan is home to many 
liberal-minded, politically active 
students, but these students are 
overwhelmingly white, educated 

and upper-middle class. I do 
not intend to shame anyone for 
holding these identities, but it is 
imperative, now more than ever, 
to understand one’s ability and 
role in activism.

Political and social activism 

have historically been popular 
among 
white 
people, 
and 

as a result, women of color 
have been excluded from and 
marginalized in various major 
moments in activist history. 
Many movements toward gender 
equality 
almost 
exclusively 

catered toward the ideals of 
heterosexual, middle-class white 
women. This dissociation led 
to the creation of “womanism,” 
a term coined by Alice Walker, 
which focuses on issues unique 
to women of color. Despite social 
progress in the past few decades, 
the involvement of people of color 
in activism has elicited feelings 
of discontent among certain 
white Americans. Many white 
women claim to feel threatened 
by the supposed “attack on 
unity” resulting from the focus 
on intersectional oppression. This 
has generated significant debate as 
to what the purpose of protesting 
should be and also the importance 
of recognizing that those who 
are the subjected to the deepest 
injustices are not white women 
(and never have been).

People of color have also raised 

criticism of this being the first 
instance in which so many white 
women have expressed outrage, 
our silence being broken now 
that our rights are under attack. 
Incidents of police brutality have 
been circulating media outlets 
for years, and yet very few white 
women have participated in the 
many peaceful protests that have 
occurred in response to these 
atrocities. Luvvie Ajayi, best-
selling author and media icon, 
stated eloquently in a recent 
Facebook post: “Remember that 
you as a white person are walking 
in a body of privilege. You didn’t 
show up before but you can show 

up now. NOW. When the next 
Sandra Bland, Aiyana Stanley-
Jones, Rekia Boyd, Trayvon 
Martin, Michael Brown, Eric 
Garner etc etc etc happens, you 
better come out. We will need 
you to show up again and again, 
in these numbers.”

While there could be any 

number of excuses made for 
why white women (once again, 
myself included) haven’t shown 
up yet, none will suffice. The 
new administration has made it 
clear that it will follow through 
on 
the 
campaign 
promises 

of the campaign — platforms 
that attack the rights of many 
minority Americans.

White women, the first step 

we should take is to listen and 
respect the opinions of women 
of color. Our voices have been 
powerful 
in 
the 
past, 
and 

when the time is right, we can 
use our voices to empower all 
marginalized identities. We can 
no longer pretend it is sufficient 
to post Facebook statuses and 
express our concern on social 
media. We can no longer turn the 
other cheek to microaggressions 
and daily injustice.

We can no longer avoid real 

activism, as Madeline Nowicki 
wrote in an op-ed for The Michigan 
Daily, when she outlined some 
great opportunities for action. We 
must utilize our privilege to help 
those without it. Activism is not 
activism if you only seek change 
for yourself. We are responsible for 
helping to safeguard the well-being 
of all Americans, especially those 
who are being threatened under 
this administration. And while the 
challenge seems insurmountable, 
that does not make it an unworthy 
or hopeless cause. In the words of 
Audre Lorde, “I am not free while 
any woman is unfree, even when 
her shackles are very different 
from my own.”

Depoliticize Arabic studies

IBTIHAL MAKKI | OP-ED

T

he 
College 
of 
LSA 

language 
requirement 

asserts that, “informed 

respect for other cultures (and) 
tolerance … are the hallmarks 
of a liberal arts education, and 
the study of foreign languages 
fosters 
precisely 
these 

capacities.” In my experience, 
however, these capacities are not 
promoted equally by all language 
departments at the University 
of Michigan. Specifically, our 
Arabic program, which uses the 
problematic textbook, “al-Kitaab 
fii Ta’allum al-Arabiyya,” which 
translates to “The Book in the 
Learning of Arabic” (hereafter: 
“al-Kitaab,” “The Book”).

As a daughter of Lebanese 

immigrants, during my 18 years 
living in an Arabic-speaking 
household 
before 
college, 

I never heard either of my 
parents use the Arabic term for 
“United Nations.” Bearing this 
in mind, imagine my confusion 
as “al’umam almuttahida,” the 
UN, was introduced in Lesson 
One of “al-Kitaab.” Vocabulary 
terms in Lesson Two included 
translation, 
translator, 

specializing and admissions. 
Lesson Three included Army, 
officer 
(in 
an 
army) 
and 

political science.

Lesson 
10 
dedicates 
a 

section to learning about the 
non-Arab “Ayatollah,” or the 
supreme leader, of Iran. The 
terms for “to play,” “sports,” 
“running,” “life” and “hobby” 
are not introduced until Lesson 
Six. Additionally, the online 
companion regularly includes 
Orientalist 
depictions 
of 

Arabs, including young women 
marrying older male cousins 
with aspirations to be stay-at-
home moms, college students 

not permitted to leave their 
homes and various arranged 
marriages.

The way in which languages 

are taught is a reflection of 
how they are perceived to be 
utilized and it is inaccurate 
to indicate that such terms 
are more important to Arabic 
communication 
than 
the 

colors, numbers greater than 
10, days of the week and 
months of the year — taught in 
the second, third and fourth 
semesters of Arabic. Many of 
these terms may seem harmless 
as they stand alone. However, 
in considering the context of 
“The Book” as a whole, after 
completing 15 credits of Arabic, 
students can say “my uncle is 
an army general,” but not “my 
uncle has green eyes.”

Students can say, “I hope 

to major in political science, 
specialize 
in 
translation 
of 

Arabic news and work for 
the UN” but not, “I hope to 
write poetry.” As a University 
that is proactively promoting 
inclusivity and understanding 
through the plan for Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion, it should not 
be acceptable to use a book that 
teaches the word for “oil” before 
the verb “to think.”

Teaching Arabic through this 

blatantly politically charged lens 
has problematic educational and 
social implications, necessitating 
analysis 
and 
constructive 

criticism. 
If 
the 
University 

regards 
second 
language 

acquisition as providing “deep 
awareness of linguistic and 
cultural 
differences 
and 
a 

means to bridge them,” as is 
stated on the LSA website, 
then it is the responsibility of 
our language departments to 
uphold that vision. Utilizing 
a 
textbook 
that 
prioritizes 

politicized 
vocabulary 
only 

serves to perpetuate negative 

generalizations 
about 
Arab 

culture and does not portray an 
accurate representation of my 
culture, my family or myself. This 
concern is further exacerbated 
when considering that Arabic 
101 may be many students’ 
first formal introduction to the 
language and culture and, as 
such, they may be less equipped 
to recognize these biases and 
divorce them from reality. 

The dominant traits inherent 

to 
Arab 
culture 
— 
which 

emphasizes 
hospitality 
and 

generosity, cherishes family and 
food and appreciates literature 
and music — should not be 
lost to the global discourses 
that have undoubtedly been 
restricted to conflicts, politics 
and security. I am not oblivious 
to the fact that many students 
enroll in Arabic classes in 
pursuit of relevant professions 
at the UN, Department of 
State and any other number of 
synonymous assemblies. The 
questions 
remain, 
however: 

Why does the Arabic program 
cater to these students, and why 
am I automatically subjected to 
this framework?

It would be more appropriate 

for the Department of Near 
Eastern Studies to adopt a 
different textbook and create 
a separate, advanced class for 
students proficient in Arabic 
who wish to expand their 
political vocabulary. I am aware 
that the majority of American 
universities 
use 
“al-Kitaab, 

“as the grammar lessons are 
effective. However, if this book 
is recognized as problematic and 
enabling harmful stereotypes, 
then 
the 
University 
should 

search for a better book — or 
write one.

During the past few years, 

the CW has been on an 
upswing in content. While it 
struggles with ratings, the 
network has been producing 
a number of quality television 
shows catered to progressive, 
young adult audiences. The 
CW’s 
hilarious 
female-

driven 
comedies 
(“Crazy 

Ex-Girlfriend” and “Jane the 
Virgin”) have become award-
winning 
critical 
darlings, 

while its long-running dramas 
(“The Vampire Diaries” and 
“Supernatural”) 
and 
superhero-

centric programs 
(“Arrow,” 
“The 
Flash,” 

“Arrow” 
and 

“DC’s 
Legends 

of 
Tomorrow”) 

have 
developed 

online cult followings. The 
newest addition of “Riverdale,” 
an updated adaptation of the 
famed Archie Comics, seems 
to fit the CW mold perfectly, 
but its ability to draw in both 
acclaim and devout fan bases 
is still up in the air.

In the promos preceding 

“Riverdale” ’s premiere, the 
show was thought to be a 
grittier, darker take on the 
much 
more 
lighthearted 

comic series. The description 
is 
certainly 
true 
for 
the 

most 
part 
— 
“Riverdale” 

uses a tantalizing, neo-noir 
murder mystery as a framing 
device for establishing the 
characters, story and location. 
But contrary to the initial 
perception, 
“Riverdale” 
is 

much more than “‘Twin Peaks’ 
meets 
Archie.” 
The 
show 

maintains a sly self-awareness 
to its own soapy nature and 
thus 
infuses 
unabashed 

melodrama, 
pop 
culture-

heavy humor and a cast of 
attractive characters into its 
story.

From the first minute of 

the pilot, the show’s laconic 
narrator, 
Jughead 
(Cole 

Sprouse, “Suite of Zack and 
Cody,” in a welcome return 
to television), sets the story 
in motion: After the sudden, 
mysterious death of a beloved 
high 
school 
student, 
the 

residents of the titular town 
must grapple with the tragic 
news 
while 
dealing 
with 

secrets and inner demons of 
their own. There’s Archie 
Andrews (K.J. Apa, “A Dog’s 
Purpose”), the football player/
aspiring 
musician 
whose 

affair with his music teacher 
Miss Grundy (Sarah Habel, 
“Whip It”) threatens both 
of 
their 
reputations. 
The 

seemingly 
perfect 
blonde 

Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart, 
“The Kings of Summer”) has 
been harboring a crush on 
Archie for quite some time, 
but finds some competition 
in rich girl Veronica Lodge 
(newcomer Camila Mendes) to 
win his affection. With a few 
twists and turns, “Riverdale” 
sets up its intriguing premise 
in admirable fashion, but not 
without a few bumps along the 
road.

Though 
“Riverdale” 
is 

right on the cusp of being 

something more than a typical 
teen mystery drama (think 
Freeform’s 
“Pretty 
Little 

Liars”), it occasionally falls 
into the trappings of one. The 
dialogue has genuine moments 
of wit, but for the most part, 
its excessive reliance on pop 
culture references makes it 
almost grating to listen to. 
Unlike “Gilmore Girls” or 
“Veronica Mars,” “Riverdale” 
seems a little too keen on 
making references that are 
obscure 
(“I’m 
already 
the 

Blue Jasmine of Riverdale 
High”), cheesy (“You should 
be the Queen Bey of this drab 
hive”) and just plain confusing 

(“Can’t 
we, 

in 
this 
post-

James 
Franco 

world, just be all 
things?”).

Moreover, the 

personalities 
of 

the 
characters 

are a bit far-

fetched. 
In 
particular, 

Archie has yet to show a 
single character flaw — he’s 
talented, athletic and a tad 
too gorgeous to be considered 
a 
relatable 
protagonist. 

Conversely, the show’s main 
villain, redheaded queen bee 
Cheryl Blossom (newcomer 
Madelaine Petsch), has yet 
to show a single redeemable 
quality — she’s manipulative, 
entitled and a note too one-
dimensional to be considered 
a compelling antagonist.

At 
the 
same 
time, 

“Riverdale” seems confident 
in developing these characters 
by intertwining its mystery 
subplot with a coming-of-age 
story that gets at the heart 
of its source material. The 
love triangle between Archie, 
Veronica and Betty was always 
an integral part of the original 
comics, but to see it fully 
realized in a live-action take 
is quite entertaining and could 
easily prompt a “Team Betty 
vs. Team Veronica” situation. 
But instead of simply pitting 
Betty and Veronica against 
each 
other, 
“Riverdale” 

stitches the two into a strong 
female friendship that modern 
television could really use.

The 
internal 
conflicts 

underlying 
Archie, 
Betty 

and Veronica also offer some 
insight into the characters’ 
lives, especially with their 
complicated family dynamics. 
Veronica 
tries 
to 
reinvent 

herself when she moves to 
Riverdale in an attempt to 
disassociate 
herself 
from 

her 
father’s 
mysterious 

scandal. 
Archie 
wants 
to 

fulfill his passion for writing 
music 
against 
his 
father’s 

wishes. Betty represses her 
pent-up anger against her 
authoritarian mother. All of 
these complex issues make 
it 
clear 
that 
“Riverdale” 

still cares deeply about the 
characters and how they fit 
into the larger narrative of 
growing up in a world that 
can be cruel and dangerous 
(hence, the murder mystery 
subplot). 

The show’s soundtrack, too, 

complements the era well, 
incorporating songs from M83, 
Santigold, Tove Styrke and 
Tegan and Sara. There’s even 
a wonderful synthpop cover of 
Cyndi Lauper’s “All Through 
the Night,” performed by the 
school’s ferocious girl trio 
Josie and the Pussycats. If 
there’s one thing “Riverdale” 
is doing right in terms of 
recreating Archie for today, 
it’s with its music choices. 

While 
the 
writing 
and 

characterizations 
may 
be 

uneven, the parts that do 
work absolve the majority 
of “Riverdale” ’s faults. The 
pilot’s cliffhanger — more 
clues 
on 
the 
death 
and 

possible murder of the student 
are 
revealed 
— 
certainly 

makes “Riverdale” engaging 
enough to continue watching. 
Perhaps after it builds some 
momentum, “Riverdale” can 
hopefully join the ranks of 
its fellow CW binge-worthy 
programs. 

Uneven ‘Riverdale’ still 
holds true to CW mold

Archie in a diner in the series premiere

Garage 
rock 
artists 
like 

Ty Segall are essential to the 
mainstreaming of rock music. 
Everything 
about 
his 
music 

screams retrospective rock ‘n’ 
roll, while keeping the genre fresh 
through the use of heavy-handed 
distortion. Artists like Segall, 
through their indie-tinged take 
on rock, are the ones responsible 
for summer festival-
goers head-banging 
their flower crowns 
off to massive pop 
tunes 
masked 

under guitar riffs 
and solos that bring 
out the rocker in 
anyone.

Ty Segall is exactly what you 

would expect from albums of this 
festival punk archetype — it’s a 
bright drunken haze of an album. 
The blurry black and white image 
on the cover speaks for itself: A 
dark image of a man who lacks any 
tangible features other than the 
curtain of hair covering his face. 
Even though the cover represents 
the 
genre, 
the 
album 
itself 

features tracks that produced 
poignant definition between the 
songs on the album. On his latest 
effort, Segall has expanded the 
dirtier lo-fi atmosphere of the 
oldies rock on 2015’s Ty Rex by 
utilizing incredibly well-written 
pop melodies, a common staple 

that has brought the garage rock 
niche popularity to the festival-
going crowd.

Segall is never afraid to show off 

his talents. The man is incredibly 
adept at his craft, sprinkling 
lightning fast guitar melodies 
throughout the album that give 
it the rock credibility it needs 
to survive in the 21st century. 
Segall’s penchant for writing 
both vocal and guitar melodies 
keeps the album fresh, each song 
distinct from the next, despite 

the distortion that 
permeates 
his 

work.

The 
drunken, 

romantic aesthetic 
commonly 
found within the 
modernization 

of rock, a movement fronted 
by artists like Twin Peaks and 
Mac Demarco, is palpable on the 
album. With lyrics like, “Take my 
guitar / I’ll be at the bar,” and “I 
don’t want to call you baby,” Segall 
paints imagery of long-haired sad 
boys ruminating over love with 
a stiff drink in hand. It’s lovable, 
fun imagery that adds relatability 
to a genre that can otherwise feel 
removed.

Back-to-back tracks “Papers” 

and “Take Care (To Comb Your 
Hair)” 
are 
pleasantly 
light-

hearted 
and 
cryptic 
to 
the 

point of goofiness, adding to the 
romance through their detail. 
Segall shows he’s capable of more 
than just the lo-fi rock ‘n’ roll we 

have come to expect from him. 
These floaty indie rock tracks 
give the album more depth than 
he’s accomplished on more recent 
releases, which tended to stick to 
his status-quo brand of punk. It 
makes for great effect before his 
goodbye — a lonely pair of chords 
on 12-second closer “Untitled.”

By getting in touch with his 

tender side, Segall has written 
a record that is not only ripe for 
throwing yourself around in a 
pit, but also includes moments for 
swaying along to the melody with 
breezy 
carelessness. 
“Talkin’” 

tones down the album, taking cues 
from music that almost feels like 
Beatles-era rock, while “Thank 
You Mr. K” brings it back to speed 
with rollicking piano added to the 
mix. It’s an effective play with 
varying tempo and volume, and 
the result is an unexpected but 
far-reaching album.

On 
his 
second 
self-titled 

record, Segall has taken the 
often 
two-dimensionality 
of 

garage rock and made it three-
dimensional 
through 
modern 

twists that give it distinction from 
the typical hazy aesthetic of the 
genre. It’s far from a surprising 
or magnificent album, but Segall 
succeeds in taking on his genre of 
choice with a broader view. To put 
it bluntly, it’s damn good — full of 
wit and charm. Hiding beneath 
rough riffs, shrill solos and a 
somber cover, Ty Segall proves 
that its namesake isn’t as sad as 
he’d make you believe.

‘Segall’ boasts essentials 
for a modern rock album

“Riverdale” is 

much more than 

“‘Twin Peaks’ 
meets Archie.”

There’s nothing quite like crying 

during a movie. It’s cathartic, 
usually embarrassing and the best 
part is that after it’s over, you wipe 
your eyes in the sheltered darkness 
of the theater and promptly 
pretend it never happened. There 
are 
some 
signposts 
marking 

which movies will make you cry 
— if there’s a dog, if it’s about some 
sort of tragic event, if it’s nostalgic 
for your childhood, or if it’s a 
beautiful celebration of the power 
of humanity coming together. The 
last one might just be a personal 
preference (I dare you to name 
someone who didn’t cry at the end 
of “The Martian” though), but the 
fact is you never really know when 
it’ll happen, which is part of what 
makes movie-crying so special.

You don’t have 
to know 

anything about musical theatre 
or Stephen Sondheim to get 
something out of “The Best 
Worst Thing That Ever Could 
Have Happened,” a documentary 
chronicling 
the 
making 
and 

failure of the Sondheim musical 
“Merrily We Roll Along.” In fact, 
you can know next to nothing 
about musical theater and still 
find yourself stupidly wondering 
where all this water on your face 

is coming from.

“The Best Worst Thing” was 

made by Lonny Price, one of the 
original cast members in the 
musical, and combines footage 
from 
the 
original 
rehearsal 

process in the early 1980s and 
present-day 
interviews 
with 

the cast and creators, including 
Sondheim himself. The musical 
itself was about the relentless 
passage of time and 
the erosion of the 
idealistic dreams of 
people in their youth. 
Ironically (or maybe 
not ironically at all), 
“Merrily We Rolled 
Along” was not a 
successful 
show; 

it closed after only 
16 shows, making it a painfully 
fitting subject for this particular 
documentary.

Each of the original cast 

members remembers their time 
working on the show as some of the 
best days of their lives — getting to 
work with the legendary Stephen 
Sondheim on a Broadway stage. 
They all spent their childhoods 
wearing their record players thin 
with Sondheim’s official cast 
recordings, and now they had 
all received their big breaks as 
actors with their hero. To watch 
the documentary footage of the 
rehearsals in the 1980s is to see 
a bunch of kids (the cast’s ages 
ranged from 16 to 25 years old) 

experience the greatest joy they 
might ever know.

They 
staked 
all 
of 
their 

hopes and dreams on this show, 
believing it to be the culminating 
moment of their lives. In a video 
from 1981, a 23-year-old Lonny 
Price said, “If I get hit by a bus 
the day after opening night, I 
don’t think I’ll care, because at 
least I got to do this,” flashing the 

biggest, 
most 

earnest 
smile 

you’ve 
ever 

seen. 
Price 

was 
not 
the 

only one who 
felt this way. 
The 
contrast 

between 
such 

footage 
and 

present-day interviews of the 
same cast members, now much 
older, wiser and almost entirely 
sadder is jarring, to say the least.

The intended audience of this 

documentary is most certainly 
aspiring actors, theater students 
and of course Sondheim fans 
young and old. And yet, at its core, 
“The Best Worst Thing” is a story 
about a bunch of young people 
thinking they’ll never be any older 
and that their hearts will never 
break, and a bunch of adults who 
know better, but still think it’s 
worth hoping. There isn’t anyone 
in the world who isn’t one or the 
other. So, of course, there wasn’t a 
dry eye in the theater.

‘Best ’ honors Sondheim

“The Best 

Worst Thing”

Atlas Media Corp.

Michigan Theater

On April 23 of last year, I tweeted: 

“I wish you could get a yearly 
exorcism where all your like worst 
insecurities and petty jealousies got 
pulled out of you.” I was imagining 
some supernatural way to treat fear, 
some mystical way to conveniently 
get rid of all those self-destructive 
insecurities that keep you from 
being the best person you can be.

Then, over winter break, I 

started watching “The Leftovers,” 
and I found it.

In the eighth episode of the 

second 
season, 
Kevin 
Garvey 

takes a trip through the afterlife, 
represented in the series as a hotel. 
He is told that in this realm, he is an 
international assassin, tasked with 
killing a presidential candidate. 
The candidate is Patti Levin, the 
same woman whose ghost has 
haunted Kevin throughout the 
season, forcing him to confront 
his complicity in her death and in 
the dissolution of his own family. 
Perhaps if Kevin can track down 
and kill Patti in this purgatory, he 
will find some sense of closure, 
some acceptance of how his life has 
been derailed.

The question, then, is how much 

of this is real. Is this realm he 
inhabits really the afterlife? Does 
everybody experience purgatory 
as a hotel? Is the Patti we see — 
in all three forms, whether as a 
presidential candidate, an innocent 
little girl or the cult leader we know 
— really Patti, or has she solely 
been a hallucination representing 
Kevin’s deepest fears throughout 
the season?

One of the biggest strengths of 

“The Leftovers” (or one of its biggest 
weaknesses, depending on who you 
ask) is how much these answers 
are left ambiguous. The answer is 
sometimes both; yes, by drowning 
Patti in the afterlife, Kevin may be 
setting her actual spirit free, but it 
means just as much for his personal 
character development that he is 
willing to cross that line and kill her.

What if we all had these glimpses 

of the afterlife? What if you could 
poison yourself like Kevin did, 
take a journey through a hotel of 
your demons and come back alive 

rejuvenated and convicted? What 
if you could reduce each of your 
insecurities to a physical being, and 
by drowning them, exorcise them?

To be clear, “The Leftovers” 

doesn’t represent this option as a 
simple cure-all. The third and final 
season, which airs in April, will 
surely present many more obstacles 
standing in the way of Kevin’s 
happy ending. The specter of Patti 
was just one of many personal 
struggles he has experienced over 
the course of the series. But there’s 
still something about the idea that 

seems beautiful and simple.

Maybe it’s my relative stage 

in life that makes this fantasy so 
appealing. Maybe it’s the fact that 
I’m graduating soon, being thrown 
out into a world where friends 
aren’t a built-in guarantee, where 
my day lacks the structure that 
classes and a part-time library job 
provide. In this final semester, 
instead of finding myself liberated 
by the abundance of free time, I 
sometimes find myself weirdly 
constrained by it. I have the sense 
that I’m at a standstill, waiting 
for something exciting to happen. 
I should be enjoying the lack of 
obligations, but new stressors are 
quick to replace the old, providing 
an ample supply of residual teenage 
angst in the final months before I 
enter the “real world.” Sometimes, 
all I want is to enter a terrifying 
place, deal with everything that 
haunts me and then resume life.

Imagine it: You wake up in a hotel 

room you don’t recognize, with a 
vaguely familiar guy standing over 
you, smirking and saying things 
like, “Your writing will never be 
good enough” and “How do you 
expect to make it in the real world 

when you still have to Google 
simple household chores?” You 
push him out the window with a 
satisfying explosion of glass, watch 
him tumble to his death and feel 
yourself stop worrying about those 
things.

You hear a knock at the door and 

open it to find a parade of people 
marching in. After you wake up 
from this dream, you won’t be 
able to remember anything about 
their appearances except that 
they looked like amalgamations of 
everyone who ever hurt you, anyone 
who contributed to your deepest 
insecurities. There was the girl who 
looked like seemingly every girl 
you’d ever had romantic feelings for, 
telling you she didn’t feel the same 
way. There was the guy who looked 
like some ridiculous, stereotypical 
masculine ideal, all muscles and 
crooked smiles.

And all of these imaginary 

figures you vanquished, with the 
gallant swing of a sword or the 
flick of a lighter. You watched their 
imaginary visages crumble like 
rock or melt like paper. It didn’t feel 
violent or cruel, because they 
weren’t real. They were the 
worst parts of you, the parts 
you wanted to move past.

And then the world around 

you dissolved before your eyes, 
disappearing into blackness. 
Your eyes opened, expecting the 
cold white interior of the hotel 
room, but instead there was 
the warm glow of your bedside 
lamp and the Christmas lights 
strung across your ceiling. The 
heaped clothes on the chair, the 
leaning towers of books, the 
hum of the old mini-fridge — it 
was home.

You stood up, went upstairs, 

took a shower. As the warm 
water ran over your shoulders, 
you thought about what you 
would do that day. You stepped 
out of the shower, wiped the 
condensation from the mirror 
and looked at yourself, bony 
chest and bags under your eyes 
and hair too long or too short 
or too flat. And you didn’t see 
anything wrong this time.

Watching “Resident Evil: The 

Final Chapter” is like staring 
directly into the sun for two 
hours. For those who care about 
the wellbeing of their eyes, it’s 
unrecommendable. It may be one 
of the most inanely put together 
films in recent memory. Not a 
single action scene makes logical 
sense (nor a single one of the jump-
scares works). Its characters barely 
qualify as such; they’re cannon 

fodder meant to be killed off to 
give the illusion of “tension.” None 
of the “Resident Evil” films prior to 
this have been particularly good, 
but they’re bearable. “The Final 
Chapter” pivots that.

Fans of the franchise will pay no 

mind to any of this. They’ve stuck 
with it this long because of those 
B-movies tones. They’re fun, and 
it’s impossible to argue against 
that. It’s important for them to 
understand, however, that “The 
Final Chapter” pays very little 
mind to what they may want out 
of the finale of the franchise. The 
film picks up three weeks after 

the finale of the previous film 
in the series, meaning that the 
cliffhanger “Retribution” ended 
with goes unanswered. 
In many ways, that sets 
the stage for what’s to 
come. What better way 
for director Paul W.S. 
Anderson (“Pompeii”) 
to clue his fans in on 
the kind of movie 
they’re about to watch 
than by gaslighting them?

That’s not even the worst of 

it: The prologue to “The Final 
Chapter” features Alice (Milla 
Jovovich, “Survivor”) speaking 

directly to the audience, explaining 
everything that has happened 
in the series so far. The problem 
is that this glorified “Previously 
on…” segment literally rewrites the 
franchise. In this way, “The Final 
Chapter” is barely the finale to 

the “Resident Evil” 
franchise. It’s the 
capper to another 
series entirely, with 
different characters 
and 
a 
different 

mythology.

For most of the 

movie, it’s unclear 

why Anderson would rob his fans 
of the possibility of closure and 
a rewarding ending to a series 
that they love. By the third act, it 
has become shockingly obvious. 

History was rewritten to force 
one final twist, and in all fairness, 
it’s a twist that might have worked 
had it actually been planned from 
the beginning. Instead, it was 
shoehorned in at the last moment, 
one last betrayal from Anderson to 
the fans that he claims to love.

If “The Final Chapter” is an 

insult to fans of “Resident Evil,” it’s 
completely insufferable to those 
who have been on the fence so far. 
It sells itself as an action-horror 
film, but it fails utterly on both 
those accounts. With the action, 
everything is cut so fast and so 
awkwardly that even fights that 
might have been cool are rendered 
completely 
unintelligible. 
This 

reaches its peak later in the movie, 
where every frame for a full second 

is a different shot. It is painful to 
watch. Action has to be legible 
to be exciting, and “The Final 
Chapter” is anything but.

The horror doesn’t fare any 

better. Every two minutes, like 
clockwork, the sound falls out 
for a few moments before there’s 
an explosion of noise and rapid 
cuts. It would have been subtler if 
Anderson himself had shown up 
in the theater to scream directly 
into audience members’ ears, “You 
should be scared now!”

No 
matter 
its 
prospective 

audience, no matter its intentions, 
“Resident Evil: The Final Chapter” 
fails. The only thing anyone can 
hope it succeeds at is sticking with 
its titular promise: It better be “The 
Final Chapter” of this franchise.

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
After a blistering offensive 
performance against Indiana 
on Thursday, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team (4-5 Big 
Ten, 14-8 overall) headed to the 
Breslin Center, eager to bring its 
hot shooting along with it. But 
while the Wolverines’ offense 
has carried them this season, 
their defense, particularly from 
the perimeter, has cost them 
dearly.
It came back to bite them 
once 
again 
Sunday 
against 
Michigan State (5-4, 13-9), as 
the Spartans shot 45 percent 
from three and opened up 
a 
nine-point 
lead 
midway 
through the second half — a 
deficit that Michigan could not 
overcome in a 70-62 loss.
Though 
Michigan 
State 
had been down by one with 15 
minutes left in the game, the 
Spartans went on a 12-5 run 
in the span of five minutes — 
bookended by 3-pointers from 
guard Matt McQuaid — to take 

a 54-45 lead. In a back-and-
forth bout between two evenly-
matched teams, the run turned 
out to be the knockout blow, 
and the Wolverines managed 
just five points from the floor 
the rest of the way.
“We just really couldn’t get 
good looks,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “They just 
shut down a lot of the things 
that we do, they had a great 
defensive plan, and it worked 
really well.”
Michigan also scored six 
free-throws down the stretch, 

all courtesy of senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., who had 
come alive in the second half. 

One of just four Wolverines 
who hails from the state of 
Michigan, 
Walton 
made 
it 
abundantly clear Friday that he 
was eager to take on Michigan 
State, and his efforts on the 
floor Sunday showed it.
“I 
think 
he 
understands 
this rivalry probably as good 
as anybody out there,” Beilein 
said.
With Walton leading the 
charge, 
Michigan 
turned 
around its offensive fortunes. 
He opened the stanza with 
back-to-back 3-pointers to tie 
the game at 34, and he pushed 
the pace on offense in the hope 
that his teammates would do 
the same.
“I know this team looks at 
me as a leader,” Walton said. 
“When I play and show the face 
that, ‘It’s time to win’ I think 
they follow suit. ... I just try to 
exude it by playing hard and 
smart.”
While he finished with a 
game-high 24 points and nearly 
notched a double-double with 
nine rebounds, the rest of the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 
seem 

to shoot their way out of the 
funk. They finished the game 
shooting just 34 percent from 
the floor and 27 percent from 
beyond the arc — a dramatic 
drop from their last game when 
they shot 63 and 55 percent, 
respectively. 
If a single trend has emerged 
from Michigan’s performances 
this season, it’s that when 
sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 
Wagner finds himself in foul 
trouble in the early stages of the 
game, the Wolverines’ offense 
struggles to find a groove. 
That trend continued against 
the Spartans, as Wagner played 
just seven minutes of the first 
half. He picked up a quick foul 
just two minutes into the game, 
and later picked up his second 
with eight minutes left in the 
half.
“He’s got a high skill level, 
and it allows us to flow through 
some things,” Beilein said. “But 
he is also learning defensively, 
so he’s still a work-in-progress. 
… At times, he makes our 
offense and our defense much 
better.”

Wagner’s 
replacement, 
senior forward Mark Donnal, 
managed to keep the Wolverines 
in the game, though, scoring 
a team-high seven points in 
the first half to help Michigan 
enter the halftime break facing 
just a four-point deficit. 
But while the Wolverines 

held on in the early stages of 
the second half, Michigan State 
turned it on in a flash and never 
looked back. The Spartans were 
led by freshman forward Miles 
Bridges, who notched a double-

double with 15 points and 13 
rebounds. In reality, it was 
more of the same from Bridges, 
who already led the team in 
both scoring and rebounding 
with an average of 16.4 and 8.1 
per game, respectively.
Though Michigan had begun 
to turn its conference season 
around with wins over Illinois 
and Indiana this past week, 
an entirely different challenge 
awaited the Wolverines inside 
the Breslin Center.
Michigan State may not have 
been having the season that 
many expected, not to mention 
that it had just lost three 
consecutive games to Ohio 
State, Indiana and Purdue, but 
the rivalry game brought out a 
different energy altogether in 
both the players and the fans. 
Spartan coach Tom Izzo stated 
after the game that the crowd 
made a huge difference and 
that his players fed off their 
enthusiasm.
Midway through the second 
half, the Spartans took their 
big swing, and Michigan simply 
couldn’t recover.

‘M’ thrives at Saginaw Valley 
State Jets Pizza Invitational

Through just two scored 
meets this season, the No. 11 
Michigan women’s track and 
field team is already where 
Michigan coach James Henry 
expected it to be. Amongst the 
Wolverines’ five event wins at 
the non-scoring Saginaw Valley 
State Jets Pizza Invitational 
this past weekend, Michigan’s 
runners claimed the top seven 
spots in the one-mile race and 
swept the top four spots in the 
weight throw.
“The pressure is on its way,” 
Henry said. “So this meet we 
just wanted to relax and have 
some fun.”
On Friday, competitors in the 
field events started on a high 
note, as junior Bailey Baker 
notched a personal record in the 
weight throw, tossing for 18.42 
meters. 
Freshman 
Courtney 

Jacobsen, junior Kayla Deering 
and freshman Meagan Malloy 
followed 
suit, 
taking 
the 
second, third and fourth spots 
for Michigan, respectively.
“The first month of the 
indoor season is where you 
work, and the second month is 
where you see results,” Baker 
said. “Our group is seeing 
results pretty early, and I think 
that’s a testament to how hard 
we’ve been training and all the 
work we’ve put in.”
Deering 
claimed 
second 
place in the shot put with a 
14.12 meter heave, while Baker 
finished in fifth.
In the high jump, senior 
Aaron Howell took first after 
clearing the bar at 1.68 meters, 
while freshman Jada Wimberly 
came in second just behind her 
with a top height of 1.63 meters. 
In the pole vault, senior Sarah 
Uhlian 
was 
the 
runner-up, 
clearing the bar at 3.70 meters, 

trailing only Windsor’s Rachael 
Wolfs, who cleared 3.91 meters.
Much of the Wolverines’ early 
success this year has come from 
strong performances from their 
freshmen. The group has been 
headlined by Julia Hall, who 
has finished first and second 
in two 600-meter races at the 
Simmons-Harvey 
Invitational 
and the Notre Dame Invitational, 
respectively. 
This 
weekend, 
in her 400-meter debut, Hall 
claimed first place once again, 
besting the second-place finisher 
by more than 0.5 seconds.
“I 
was 
still 
a 
little 
disappointed with my time, but 
it was a learning race,” Hall 
said. “I know it’s not possible to 
break a record every meet, but 
I’m excited to see what I can do 
with a little more practice.”
Senior 
Courtney 
Munley 
competed 
unattached 
for 
Michigan and won the mile run 
by a large eight-second margin. 

The next six spots were also 
claimed by Wolverine runners, 
five of whom broke five-minute 
miles on the day.
Another Michigan victory 
came in the 4x400-meter relay 
race, 
in 
which 
sophomore 
Lauren Rodriguez, freshman 
Jade 
Harrison 
and 
seniors 
Haley 
Meier 
and 
Gina 
McNamara finished in 3:53.42.
McNamara claimed the fifth 
victory for the Wolverines, this 
time in the 800-meter contest.
While Michigan is heartened 
to see success this early in 
the year, its sights are set on 
remaining healthy and working 
to improve for the Big Ten Indoor 
Championships in a few weeks.
“We want our kids to have an 
outstanding performance later 
in the year,” Henry said. “Our 
goal here in January is just for 
the team to put forth a good 
effort and get ready for the 
result month (February).”

Wolverines break 
records in Boston

For the first time in program 
history, the Michigan men’s 
track team had three athletes 
run a sub-four minute mile in a 
single race.
“It 
was 
outstanding,” 
assistant coach Kevin Sullivan 
said. “My freshman year when 
I competed at Michigan, we had 
two guys go under four minutes 
and we thought that was a pretty 
big deal.”
Graduate students Ned Willig 
and Will Sheeran and senior 
Connor Mora all broke the 
four-minute mark at the Boston 
University John 
Thomas Terrier 
Classic, with all 
three 
reaching 
the milestone for 
the first time in 
their careers.
“I was just very 
excited,” 
Willig 
said. “It’s been a 
goal for a while, so 
it’s cool to finally 
reach that.”
Both Willig and Sheeran 
spent their undergraduate years 
at Brown University, with the 
former bringing home three Ivy 
League Championships during 
his time with the Bears.
“We knew coming in that all 
three guys had the potential 
to run under four minutes,” 
Sullivan added. “I was really 
hoping that at least one of the 
three would.
“It’s such a big barrier in the 
athletic world. … It says a lot 
about where the program is right 
now.”
In addition to the success of 
the runners in the mile race, 
the Wolverines were able to 
showcase some of its younger 
athletes at the meet.
After nearly winning the 400-
meter dash, sophomore Taylor 
McLaughlin was 0.1 seconds 
away from breaking Michigan’s 
record in the 200-meter dash, 

finishing fourth overall in the 
event.
“I think Taylor was a little 
disappointed with his 400,” 
Sullivan said. “For him to come 
back two hours later and run 
the 
second-fastest 
time 
in 
Michigan history showed a lot of 
resilience.”
Since arriving in Ann Arbor, 
the New Jersey native has 
quickly 
established 
himself 
as 
one 
of 
the 
program’s 
most 
promising 
athletes. 
McLaughlin 
has 
already 
managed to win a Big Ten 
championship, set a school 
record 
in 
the 
400-meter 
run and finish second in the 
Under-20 
World 
Junior 
championships 
in 
the 
400-
meter hurdles.
In 
addition 
to taking part 
in the Terrier 
Classic, 
the 
Wolverines 
also 
competed 
in the Saginaw 
Valley State Jets 
Pizza Invitational this weekend, 
where some of the team’s less 
experienced runners had the 
opportunity to showcase their 
abilities.
Notable 
performances 
included sophomore Matthew 
Plowman’s second-place finish 
in the 800-meter run — a career-
best — and sophomore Blake 
Washington’s 
second-place 
finish in the 400-meter run.
Despite that half of the team 
was spread out at different 
competitions, 
both 
Sullivan 
and Willig stressed that the 
dispersed set-up did not impact 
the team’s preparation. Willig 
mentioned that, though the team 
had been split up, he received 
a lot of texts congratulating 
him on his record-breaking 
performance.
“Everyone’s very supportive 
even though we’re not competing 
in the same place,” Willig said.

MEN’S TRACK AND FIELD

Imagining the perfect ‘Signing of the Stars’
A 

year ago, Tom Brady, Ric 
Flair and Migos made 
Hill Auditorium home to 
the most star-studded National 
Signing Day in 
the country. 
In case you 
dismissed 
that event as a 
fever dream, 
it bears 
repeating that 
on that day, 
Jim Leyland 
— longtime 
MLB 
Manager 
and least likely rap fan in the 
building — dabbed with the 
up-and-coming Atlanta rap trio 
Migos. Other than being an 
unpredictable collision of worlds, 
it was proof that, at ‘Signing of 
the Stars’, anything can happen.
That got us at the Michigan 
Daily thinking: What would be 
the perfect ‘Signing of the Stars?’ 
Who should introduce whom? Is 
the dab too dead to revive? We 
took a stab at predicting the ideal 
event.
11:00 a.m.: Doors open. 
Fans are stunned when they 
enter and, in place of last year’s 
cardboard cutouts, they find a 
wax sculpture of every single 
commit. There first appear to 
be two sculptures of three-star 
running back Kurt Taylor, but 
fans eventually realize Taylor 
has simply decided to pose next 
to his likeness, completely still, 
until the event begins. Oddly, 
his biceps are even more defined 
than the wax sculpture.
11:08 a.m.: Upon arriving at 
their seats, guests are delighted 
to discover Jordan Brand Signing 
of the Stars headbands. It’s not 
clear whether fans will ever use 
them, but the Jumpman logo is 
enough to send them over the 
moon.
11:59 a.m.: As lights dim in 
Crisler Center, the crowd begins 
to applaud as Randy Sklar takes 

the stage, ready to host the event 
for the second straight year. But 
just as he raises the microphone 
to his mouth, familiar music 
blares over the public address 
system, startling him. Sklar 
looks over his shoulder to see 
John Cena charging toward 
him. Cena steals the mic and 
challenges Sklar to a title match 
for the right to host the event. 
Sklar suggests the two share 
emcee responsibilities, and, for 
some reason, Cena agrees to the 
compromise.
12:12 p.m.: Harbaugh takes 
the stage for the first time. 
He does not seem to be totally 
sure whether he invited Cena, 
of if he just sort of showed up. 
Harbaugh introduces himself 
to the wrestling star and asks 
if Cena has any eligibility left. 

“You’d make a heck of a fullback,” 
Harbaugh tells him.
12:17 p.m.: Migos makes 
their first appearance to get the 
crowd fired up. They perform 
“T-Shirt,” and as the crowd goes 
wild, Quavo requests that “the 
kid in the Brady jersey I always 
saw dabbing on TV” come up on 
stage. A line of 40-50 students 
forms near the stage.
12:28 p.m.: Harbaugh begins 
introducing the early enrollees. 
The first celebrity presenters, 
introducing five-star receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, are 
the Young Pope and the actual 
Pope, both of whom declare 
their fondness for Harbaugh. 
Harbaugh fist-bumps the Young 
Pope and formally asks the actual 
Pope to baptize his newborn son, 
John, at the Vatican this spring. 

The Pope agrees to do so.
12:35 p.m.: Things are 
starting to get weird. Cena goes 
on a minute-long rant about how 
hungry he is and demands that 
sophomore offensive lineman 
Michael Onwenu, seated in the 
front row, share his large bowl 
of grapes. Onwenu refuses. 
Cena challenges him to wrestle 
for the grapes, but when 
Onwenu stands up to accept the 
challenge, Cena inexplicably 
rescinds the offer.
12:46 p.m.: Harbaugh sets up 
a live video stream introducing 
four-star quarterback Dylan 
McCaffrey. But Harbaugh can 
also be seen in the background of 
the video, climbing a tree behind 
McCaffrey’s house. At first, fans 
assume this must just be a taped 
video, but then the quarterback 

starts taking audience questions. 
One asks how it is possible 
Harbaugh is in the background. 
“Oh, that’s just one of his 
recruiting clon-” he starts to 
respond, before Harbaugh cuts 
the feed and abruptly moves on.
12:54 p.m.: The stadium goes 
fully dark for just one moment, 
and when the lights come back 
on, the stage has been turned 
into a courtroom set, Judge Judy 
presiding. Harbaugh and NCAA 
President Mark Emmert emerge 
and debate the NCAA’s recent 
passage of a measure banning 
Spring Break practice trips. 
Emmert spends his entire time 
allotment trying to explain Judge 
Judy doesn’t have jurisdiction 
over the NCAA. Judge Judy asks 
who does have jurisdiction over 
the NCAA. Emmert vanishes into 

thin air.
1:22 p.m.: That last part took a 
while. Sensing the crowd starting 
to get distracted, Harbaugh calls 
in the big guns. Tom Brady walks 
out onto the stage, with fans 
wondering aloud whether it’s a 
good idea for him to be in Ann 
Arbor during Super Bowl week. 
Brady confesses he’s actually in 
town to help the Patriots sign 
star cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
to their Super Bowl roster. “You 
can’t do that!” one Falcons fan 
shouts from the upper bowl. “You 
have to wait for the draft!”
“Who’s going to stop me?” 
Brady responds. “Roger 
Goodell?” Harbaugh and Brady 
look at each other and then burst 
into maniacal laughter. Migos is 
visibly upset.
1:36 p.m.: Harbaugh 
announces that he has a special 
surprise for fans. Najee Harris, 
the nation’s No. 1 overall player 
and an early-enrollee at Alabama, 
emerges from the tunnel and 
announces he has changed 
his mind. He wants to come to 
Michigan. Emmert re-appears 
out of thin air, ready to scold 
Harris, but Cena uses his famous 
“Attitude Adjustment” on the 
NCAA president. Emmert 
decides to allow Harris to 
transfer and play immediately.
1:40 p.m. Grateful for the 
recruiting help, Harbaugh 
convinces Onwenu to share his 
grapes with Cena.
1:41 p.m. – 1:59 p.m.: The rest 
of the event goes on. It’s basically 
the same as last year.
2:02 p.m.: Fans exit the arena 
and realize that those weren’t 
wax sculptures at all. Those were 
the real players. “So how were 
there two Kurt Taylors?” one 
intrepid student asks.
It’s a great question.

Wolverines emphasize individual improvement during bye

The Michigan hockey team 
didn’t watch any film of its 
opponents this week.
Rather, 
the 
Wolverines 
spent this past week working 
on 
improving 
themselves. 
They didn’t focus on game-day 
activities — established lines, for 
example — instead emphasizing 
individual improvement.
“We can focus on ourselves 
every day,” said junior forward 
Dexter Dancs. “It’s an extra 
week to really figure out some 
problems we have, go out and 
solve them.”
However, 
that 
doesn’t 
mean that Michigan avoided 
a 
competitive 
atmosphere 
this past week. On Friday 
and Saturday, the Wolverines 
participated in 3-on-3 drills, 
organized by Michigan coach 
Red Berenson to make up for the 
lack of a weekend series.
The Wolverines also spent the 
week seeking to maintain their 
momentum from their shootout 
victory 
over 
Michigan State 
last 
Saturday, 
something 
that 
could 
be 
challenging 
during a week 
with no games. 
Especially 
for 
a 
team 
like 
Michigan — one 
that desperately 
needs 
to 
improve 
its 
record in order 
to make a run at the NCAA 
Tournament 
— 
playing 
in 
consecutive weeks might help 
its case.
While postseason play may 
seem like lofty goal for the 
struggling Wolverines, it is on 
the minds of the players.
“We’re sitting on the bigger 
picture 
right 
now,” 
said 
freshman 
goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine. “As this team right 
now, we’re talking about six 

weeks down the road, ‘How 
are we gonna feel? How are we 
gonna play? What are people 
going to say about us? What’s 
gonna be the outcome?’ 
“Six weeks is the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
and 
we 
want 
to be ready. I think with the 
leadership in the locker room, 
that’s possible. I think we have 
the ability to be an elite team not 
only in the Big Ten, but in the 
entire country.”
The 
time 
off 
allowed 
Michigan’s 
players 
to 
relax 
their bodies from game action, 
but not from intense practices. 
The Wolverines hit the weight 
room three times this week, 
an increase from their usual 
amount.
For Berenson, though, the 
bye week meant giving his team 
the opportunity to improve on 
essential aspects of its game 
that need improvement — most 
prominently, its shot selection.
“I want their shots to be on 
the net instead of over the net 
or miss the net,” Berenson said. 
“Let’s work at getting our shots 
away 
quicker. 
Let’s 
work 
at 
taking a pass and 
shooting it right 
away 
without 
over handling it. 
A lot of the little 
details of hockey, 
we can do some 
of those things in 
practice that take 
a little bit more 
time than we can 
afford to give in 
a regular game 
week.”
The coaching staff also had 
the chance to experiment with 
some new strategies with the 
Wolverines. 
The 
extended 
practice period allowed the staff 
and players ample opportunity 
for trial and error.
Most importantly, though, 
the bye week gave Michigan 
a time to rest. While the 
Wolverines still practice every 
day, it gave a team seeming to 

battle with injuries a necessary 
week to recuperate before the 
final stretch of its season.
“The body is not getting 
physically beat up,” Dancs said. 
“… Some players have problems 
that it’s good to get a couple 
weeks off so they can rest their 
body.”
Added 
LaFontaine: 
“(Everyone’s) a little bit tired, it 
gives us extra time to relax, get 
our feet under ourselves.”
Because the Wolverines had 
no opponent Friday night, the 
players could solely focus on 
making themselves better. The 
film watching would come the 
following week, but fine-tuning 
the basic hockey skills would 
come in the present.
This self-improvement might 

be what Berenson enjoys most of 
the bye-week. The players never 
asked their coach who would 
be playing or who would be 
starting. They could just focus 
on 
shooting, 
clean 
passing 
and 
aggressive 
defense.
“(In a game 
week) you’ve got 
the pressure of 
things 
you’ve 
gotta get better 
at,” 
Berenson 
said. “Sometimes 
you’ve 
gotta 
forget 
about 
worrying about 
all 
the 
other 
pressure builders or concerns. 
… We (didn’t have) the mental 

anxiety of ‘Geez I hope I’m in 
the lineup on Thursday. I hope 
the coach tells me at the meeting 
on Thursday I’m playing.’ No 
pressure this week. Just practice 
hard and have 
fun.”
Added Dancs: 
“... That’s really 
beneficial for a 
player. 
Things 
like 
that 
can 
really 
affect 
a 
player. … You’re 
not 
thinking 
about the game 
on 
Monday 
of 
the first week as 
much you would 
on 
Monday 
if 
you’re playing on Friday.”
As Michigan transitions to 

its game week against rival No. 
8 Ohio State, the film watching 
will begin. Set lines will start to 
formulate and the focus will turn 
to the Buckeyes. For the past 
week, though, the Wolverines 
focused 
on 
themselves 
and 
having an enjoyable time, free 
from the stresses of ranked 
opponents.
“In this bye week, morale is 
high,” LaFontaine said. “The 
boys are positive, coaches are 
honest, and they are keeping a 
competitive 
nature. 
Honestly, 
it’s awesome to have a bye week. 
You get to improve on things 
you won’t usually do in another 
week.”
And the Wolverines can only 
hope that the morale will last 
for the next six weeks.

‘M’ shines in annual Autism Awareness Meet

The No. 10 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team had a day of 
firsts when it faced No. 19 Illinois 
last weekend. The team topped 
the 197.000 score mark for the 
first time this season, earned 
seven scores of 9.900 or higher 
and senior captain Nicole Artz’s 
floor routine garnered her a 
perfect 10, earning her a nod as 
Big Ten Gymnast of the Week.
It didn’t look like it could get 
any better for the Wolverines 
this early in the season. But then 
it did.
Boasting 
a 
season-high 
score of 197.225, Michigan (2-1 
Big Ten, 4-2 overall) seems to 
have found its groove, handing 
in-conference 
rival 
No. 
12 
Nebraska (2-1, 4-1) its first loss of 
the season, 197.225-194.800. The 
meet held unique importance 
to the Wolverines, as it was the 
team’s fourth annual Autism 
Awareness Meet, held at Crisler 
Center on Saturday.
The annual event began in 
2014 when assistant coach Dave 
Kuzara came back to Michigan 
and proposed the idea after 
running the event as head 
coach at Western Michigan. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
coaching 
staff 
was 
unanimously 
on 
board, passionate about raising 
awareness for the cause. 
“It’s just an amazing event,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Bev 
Plocki. “It has been such an 
educational experience for all 
of our student athletes in terms 
of understanding and accepting 
people who are a little different, 
but having the realization that 
they are brilliant as well.”
Executing 
high-energy, 
intricate routines across the 
board, the Wolverines made 
the day even more special by 
repeating last week’s magic. 
They found themselves with 
eight scores of 9.900 or higher, 
spread 
throughout 
all 
four 
events. 
Michigan 
expected 
tough competition from the 
Cornhuskers, as they placed 
second behind the Wolverines 
in the Big Ten Championship 
last season. But on Saturday, 
Michigan swept all four events, 

led in score after every rotation 
and claimed the all-around title 
in the meet.
Artz 
continued 
her 
momentum, 
taking 
the 
all-
around title for the second 
consecutive week with a top 
score of 39.500 Saturday. Artz 
and junior Paige Zaziski tied 
for first place on bars, scoring 
a 
season-high 
9.925 
in 
the 
second rotation.
Finishing 
off 
the 
meet 
and 
securing 
for 
Michigan 
a 
season-high 
score, 
Artz 
earned a 9.900 
for her dynamic 
floor 
routine, 
which 
awarded 
her the first-place title for floor in 
a three-way tie with sophomores 
Olivia Karas and Emma McLean.
There was never a shortage 
of energy from the fans and 
gymnasts during the meet, but 
the room was the most electric 
after Karas’ vault performance. 

During the first rotation, Karas 
executed 
a 
one-and-a-half 
Yurchenko and stuck the landing, 
earning her both a career-high 
score of 9.975 and the first-place 
vault title in the meet.
“I 
couldn’t 
breathe 
when 
the team came over to hug me,” 
Karas said. “Those are the best 
hugs — you remember them 
forever.”
Vault has been 
a 
consistent 
high-point 
for 
Karas, who was 
one of the top-
ranked vaulters 
in the nation last 
year. 
According 
to 
Plocki, vault was 
the Wolverines’ 
strongest 
event 
of the day, as they demonstrated 
improvement in their landings. 
Michigan had struggled with 
inconsistency, 
specifically 
on 
vault dismounts.
“We have been working really 
hard on our landings,” Plocki 
said. “We have bigger, more 

dynamic vaults, but we haven’t 
done a great job of sticking 
landings.”
For 
McLean, 
there 
was 
much to celebrate. Not only 
was Saturday her birthday, but 
she earned a career-high 9.900 
on vault, matching her career-
high of 9.900 on floor to give 
her the joint first-place title. 
It is the second week in a row 
that McLean’s floor routine has 
earned her a near perfect score.
“This year I went in with 
the mindset that I’m going to 
have a party when I do my floor 
routine,” McLean said. “It makes 
it more fun.”
The Wolverines covered all 
their bases this week, as senior 
captain Talia Chiarelli won beam 
with a 9.925, setting herself apart 
from her competitors as the only 
gymnast to earn over a 9.850 in 
the event.
Between raising awareness 
for an important cause, sweeping 
Nebraska and earning a season-
high 
score, 
Michigan 
looks 
well on its way to returning to 
championship form.

“I couldn’t 
breathe when 
the team came 
over to hug me”

Karas highlights 
win over Illinois

It 
didn’t 
take 
long 
for 
sophomore Olivia Karas to reach 
the vault. Sprinting full speed 
down the runway, she made 
contact with the springboard, 
flipping and soaring through the 
air. Somehow, through all of that, 
she managed to stick her landing 
cleanly.
As Crisler Center erupted 
in cheers, the team chased her 
down the mat and embraced her. 
They didn’t need to see the score 
to know Karas had executed the 
move spectacularly.
Team chemistry is clearly 
an important aspect of the 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team. After every event, the 
entire team congratulates their 
competing teammate with hugs 
and cheers.
“When one person is up there 
and you’re not, you have to have 

full trust and faith that they’re 
going to do everything they can 
do for you,” Karas said. “So you 
celebrate because they did the 
best possible thing for you.
“The best thing in the world 
is sticking the dismount and 
having your team come run 
up at you. It’s an indescribable 
feeling.”
Karas scored a 9.975, her 
career high on the vault, which 
was enough to secure her a 
first-place finish in the event. 
One contributing factor to her 
success in the event was her 
dismount, which the team has 
been focusing on in recent 
practices with assistant coach 
Dave Kuzara.
“Dave has done a really great 
job of getting everyone in the right 
mindset to minimize deductions 
and try your best to stick,” Karas 
said. “We’ve been working on it so 
much and it’s really nice to see all 
that hard work pay off.”
Her new career-high topped 
the 9.950 she scored back in 
March of last year at the Big Five 
Tournament.
Michigan coach Bev Plocki 
acknowledged both her difficult 
routine and flawless execution.
“Her vault is a one and a half, 
it’s a harder vault than the fulls, 
and to stick the landing like that is 
like the exclamation point,” Plocki 
said.
Along with her exemplary 
performance 
on 
the 
vault, 
Karas was also part of a three-
way tie for first place on the 
floor. She scored a 9.900, as did 
two of her teammates, senior 
Nicole Artz and sophomore 
Emma McLean.
A personal favorite for Karas, 
the floor provides a platform for 
gymnasts to showcase a diverse 
range of skills.
“I’m very animated when I do 
gymnastics, I like to get my team 
and the crowd involved in it,” 
Karas said. “Of course I like to 
tumble and stuff but the dancing 
is so fun.”
Following 
her, 
the 
team 
emerged victorious with a score of 
197.225 to Nebraska’s 194.880.

Michigan stifled by Spartan defense in loss

EAST LANSING — With 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team 
down 
by 
nine 
with 

10:32 left in the game, junior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman 
drained 
an 
open 

three to cut the deficit to six.

On the ensuing Michigan 

State possession, the Wolverines 
forced a turnover from Spartan 
guard Cassius Winston and 
bolted up the floor.

But with the chance to cut 

the lead even more, senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. dribbled into 
a crowded paint, lost the ball and 
the Spartans regained possession.

The 
next 
two 
Michigan 

offensive possessions saw more 
of the same, as senior wing Zak 
Irvin 
and 
Abdur-Rahkman 

each turned the ball over. 
Michigan State’s defense forced 
the Wolverines to turn over 
the ball on three consecutive 
possessions in under a minute.

And a minute after that, 

Spartan forward Miles Bridges 
slammed home a dunk to 
put Michigan State up by 12, 
effectively ending any chance 
of a Michigan comeback as 
the Spartans won 70-62 at the 
Breslin Center on Sunday.

Friday, 
Walton 
said 
the 

Wolverines had to be “borderline 
perfect” to win a game on the 
road. For Michigan, that crucial 
stretch of possessions in the 
second half was when it had to 
be perfect, and it wasn’t.

“There’s been two or three 

possessions that were not as 
good as we need to be,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“That’s 
college 
basketball. 

This team’s going to have great 
challenges on the road, but 
that’s the way it is.”

After 
the 
game, 
Beilein 

attributed 
Michigan 
State’s 

defense as a big reason why the 
Wolverines turned the ball over 
nine times in the second half 
— Michigan was averaging just 
over nine turnovers per game 

entering Sunday’s contest.

“Their defense was terrific,” 

Beilein said. “We’ll look at (it), 
and we’ll try to find a way to 
do some things better. They’re 
good at it, and they’ve always 
been for years and years. When 
we were able to beat them, our 
offense was really clicking, 
and it wasn’t tonight. Credit 
Michigan State.”

Michigan poses a unique 

matchup for teams with two 
big men, as redshirt sophomore 
forward 
DJ 
Wilson 
and 

sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner both shoot 3-pointers 
effectively.

But Michigan State came 

prepared.

The 
Spartans 
denied 

Michigan any “pick-and-pop” 
shots from the behind the arc, 
which forced the Wolverines to 
find other avenues for success.

While Michigan made an 

adjustment in the second half, 
evident in Walton nailing two 
3-pointers to start the stanza, 

the Wolverines still didn’t look 
comfortable.

“They weren’t giving us any 

catch and shoot threes,” Walton 
said. “They went home every 
time we drove. But we made an 
adjustment in the second half. 
We just didn’t hit the (shots) 
that we usually hit.”

The 
Spartans’ 
in-your-

face defense also forced the 
Wolverines into quick decisions, 
which sped up the overall pace 
of play, another issue that put 
Michigan off-balance.

“We came to the bench and I 

told myself and my teammates 
that I thought we were playing 
way too fast,” Walton said. “We 
were getting sped up.”

And with the team’s best 

“slasher”, 
Abdur-Rahkman, 

on the bench with foul trouble 
for most of the game, the 
Wolverines had a tough time 
driving on the Spartans.

Instead, Michigan settled for 

contested jump shots.

“We took some really tough 

shots when we were supposed 
to get to the basket,” Walton 
said. “We made an adjustment, 
but I wished we would’ve made 
it from the jump.”

Added Wagner: “We settled 

to the point where we thought 
there would be a bump when 
there wasn’t. I just think we 
need to play with better poise 
and take better shots.”

All in all, Michigan State 

dialed up the perfect defense 
to make the Wolverines just 
uncomfortable enough to put 
Michigan off its game.

Now, with nine days until the 

two teams will meet again at 
Crisler Center, the Wolverines 
will need to figure out how to 
break the defense that did just 
enough to throw them off their 
game.

“Michigan State is good,” 

Beilein said. “They’re a good 
team, whether it’s nine days 
from now or 29 days from 
now. It’s going to be a heck of a 
challenge to beat them.”

‘M’ falls to top-ranked 
Oklahoma on the road

After the men’s gymnastics 

team placed third in a six-
team field in the Windy City 
Invitational two weeks ago, 
Michigan coach Kurt Golder 
recognized the potential of his 
young team. But in order to 
combat their collective lack of 
experience, 
Golder 
increased 

the difficulty of their routines 
leading up to the meet on 
Saturday against No. 1 Oklahoma. 

That strategy might have hurt 

the Wolverines more than it 
helped them. No. 8 Michigan put 
up a new team best for total team 
score, but the experienced talent 
of the Sooners easily prevailed, 
430.050-400.800.

“I 
guess 
hindsight 
being 

20/20, I think we lost a little 
momentum,” Golder said. “We 
probably would’ve been better 
off (if we) just had another meet 
in there instead of a bye week. 
But you don’t know that until you 
have it scheduled that way, and 
then you find out that maybe that 
wasn’t the best way to approach 
it.”

From the get-go, Oklahoma 

was in the driver’s seat, and the 
Wolverines 
played 
catch-up 

throughout.

Though Michigan set season 

records in the vault and parallel 
bar events, scoring 70.950 and 
64.900, respectively, Golder was 
still displeased.

“(Oklahoma is) really good, 

but I was disappointed with our 
performance,” Golder said. “I 
know it can be difficult to go on 
the road, but that’s part of the 
game. You’ve got to go on the 
road for Big Tens and for NCAAs 
and you’ve got to perform. It is 
early in the season for us, it’s 

just our second meet and we are 
going against the No. 1 team, but I 
expected us to be a lot closer and 
have a lot better performances 
than we did.”

After an impressive outing 

at the Windy City Invitational, 
sophomore 
Emyre 
Cole 
led 

the Wolverines with dominant 
performances in floor, high bar 
and vault, where he stuck the 
landing on his Yurchenko 2.5. His 
execution earned him a 15.000, a 
tie for the night’s best score on 
vault and another event title. 
Cole also finished second on floor 
with a 14.750, falling to reigning 
NCAA champion Yul Mouldauer 
(14.850).

Despite 
the 
close 
loss, 

Golder believes Cole and his 
floor teammates — including 
senior Anthony Stefanelli and 
sophomore Anthony McCallum 
— are primed to be strong 
contenders in upcoming meets. 
Notably, 
Stefanelli 
was 
to 

perform an upgraded routine 
against Oklahoma, but rolled 
his ankle in practice last week, 
forcing him to “lay low” and 
revert to a previous routine.

Sophomores Samuel Su and 

Ryan Dunning also contributed 
with 
third-place 
finishes 
in 

pommel 
horse 
and 
rings, 

respectively.

But even after trying to build on 

the positives — as Golder and his 
coaching staff try to do after every 
meet — Michigan will be learning 
from its losses in preparation 
for next Saturday’s showdown 
against No. 6 Ohio State.

“We’re behind where I think 

we should be,” Golder said. “We 
have a bit to catch up on now. And 
it’s going to get a little tougher 
and little more demanding in 
practice so we can make up that 
ground.”

The Wolverines notched their new 
team-high score in a losing effort

Wolverines take full advantage of 
clock in victory over No. 10 Lehigh

On Sunday, everything was 

clicking in timely fashion for 
the Michigan wrestling team. 
With eight seconds left in his 
match, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Malik 
Amine 
pounced 
for 

a 
successful 
takedown, 

propelling him to a win over 
Lehigh’s Laike Gardner, the 
11th-ranked wrestler in the 
nation in the 149-pound weight 
class.

Combining 
clutch 
late-

match points with signature 
hard-nosed 
wrestling, 
the 

14th-ranked 
Wolverines 

dominated No. 10 Lehigh on 
Senior Day, coming away with 
a 24-13 victory, increasing their 
winning streak to three.

Redshirt 
senior 
Conor 

Youtsey started off the meet 
for the Wolverines in the 125-
pound weight class. Lehigh’s 

Darian Cruz — ranked eighth 
in the country — utilized early 
riding time and a takedown to 
gain the advantage. Youtsey 
mounted 
a 
comeback, 
but 

with a late takedown and an 
escape, Cruz struck first for 
the Mountain Hawks with a 4-2 
win.

However, Michigan turned 

on the jets starting at the 133-
pound weight class, powering 
its way to five straight wins. 

“Our effort was there, our 

guys are doing a good job of 
imposing our will on theirs,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland. “If you do that and 
put yourself in the driver’s seat, 
we got a lot of momentum early 
on.”

Redshirt freshman Stevan 

Micic — the seventh-ranked 
wrestler at 133 pounds — 
started this push, firing off 
takedown after takedown and 
driving his way to a 21-4 victory 

via technical fall. 

But it was redshirt freshman 

Sal Profaci who jumpstarted 
the momentum of the whole 
dual with his 3-2 decision over 
Lehigh’s Randy Cruz in the 
141-pound match. Profaci shot 
early and claimed the first two 
points of the match. As Profaci 
seemed commanding, his foe 
was countering most of his 
shot attempts. Cruz scraped 
back two points to tie the 
bout, but Profaci’s control over 
the duration of the matchup 
awarded 
him 
the 
crucial 

winning point through riding 
time.

Amine, senior Brian Murphy 

and redshirt freshman Logan 
Massa 
followed 
suit, 
all 

prevailing through a decision, 
a fall and another decision, 
respectively. Murphy put the 
crowd on its feet with his pin 
at 1:50, capping off Michigan’s 
dominant start to the dual.

“I just trust the process, and 

honestly stay in the match and 
just battle,” Amine said. “The 
kid was tough and I knew it 
was going to be a close match. 
I was chipping away at him. 
… I scored the takedown and 
I think that was the turning 
point in the match.”

Redshirt 
freshman 
Myles 

Amine 
and 
redshirt 
junior 

Aaron Calderon both dropped 
the 
next 
two 
matchups. 

Amine’s loss of riding time and 
late forfeit of takedowns led to 
his 6-2 defeat, while Calderon 
allowed 
some 
escapes, 

ultimately resulting in his 6-4 
loss.

Redshirt 
freshman 

Jackson 
Striggow 
reversed 

the 
momentum, 
though, 

with his 9-0 major decision 
over Lehigh’s Tom Murray. 
Striggow’s 
multitude 
of 

takedowns paired with over one 
minute of riding time led to his 
success, effectively clinching 
the match for the Wolverines.

With a win over a top-10 

team, Michigan is peaking at 
the right time, while it capped 
its season at Cliff Keen Arena 
in style.

Murphy notches first pin of 
season in his final home meet

In the final home match of 

a collegiate wrestler’s career, 
emotions 
run 
high 
in 
the 

excitement of the day — from being 
introduced to rousing applause 
to playing in front of friends and 
classmates for the last time.

But for Michigan senior Brian 

Murphy, the nostalgia of wrestling 
in his final match at Cliff Keen 
Arena was not a concern. He 
didn’t focus on the pageantry 
— the photos, walking out of 
the locker room with his arms 
interlocked with his parents’ and 
the announcing of all his accolades 
to the crowd. He was focused on 
winning a dual meet against No. 
10 Lehigh.

“I just try to keep it like any 

other match because that’s how I’d 
compete the best,” Murphy said. “I 
don’t worry about it.”

Later, he added: “I think it 

actually helped me a little bit. It 
helped me loosen up, just talking to 
my parents — not about wrestling 
or anything — and staying calm 
because it’s not going to be good 
if you get too nervous before a 
match.”

Murphy’s focus showed on the 

mat. He dominated and pinned 
Lehigh’s Kent Lane just 1:50 into 
the first period of the final home 
match of his career following an 
early takedown.

It was the captain’s first pin 

of the season, which capped a 
run that saw the Wolverines win 
four consecutive matches to take 
a 17-3 lead at halftime. Redshirt 
freshman Sal Profaci and redshirt 
sophomore Malik Amine were 
both victorious, notching victories 
in the final moments of the third 
period.

But true to his no-nonsense 

demeanor, Murphy’s emotions 
didn’t take the upswing one would 
expect from a college athlete after 
a dramatic victory.

“Just staying on that track and 

staying loose — I don’t try to get 
too high or too low,” Murphy said. 
“I know that it helped the team 
in a big way, so I was happy about 
that. It just keeps that momentum 

going. I was happy I was able to 
get the pin; if I just get a decision 
there, maybe that momentum 
doesn’t roll through. Those guys 
did a great job.”

Michigan earned its fourth 

team win over a ranked opponent 
this season, improving to 7-4 
overall.

“The main part of our season 

is still ahead of us, though,” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“But this is a great confidence 
builder. It’s a great moment for us.”

Despite 
the 
excitement 
of 

Profaci and Amine’s major upsets, 
Murphy received the two largest 
ovations of the afternoon from 
the Wolverine contingent — the 
first after his introduction into 
the starting lineup, and the second 
following the referee’s decision to 
give the captain the pin and six 
team points for Michigan.

His value to the Michigan 

wrestling 
program 
didn’t 
go 

unnoticed by those watching the 

senior at Cliff Keen Arena for the 
last time.

“We have a great crowd,” 

Murphy said. “Alumni come and 
watch us every dual meet — it’s 
awesome. These fans are really 
knowledgeable about the sport, 
and it’s great to have that.”

And that value is certainly 

evident to his coach.

“He’s a class act, a great kid,” 

McFarland said.” It was great to 
see him get a pin for us going into 
intermission today.”

Murphy indeed is all about 

business 
when 
it 
comes 
to 

wrestling. He and the Wolverines 
still have three regular season 
matches before the Big Ten and 
NCAA Tournaments after an early 
Senior Day. But even Murphy 
couldn’t help himself from seeing 
the sentimental nature of his 
performance Sunday afternoon.

“I tried not to focus on it, but 

after the match, it felt pretty good 
getting a pin in my last one here.”
