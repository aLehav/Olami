Week-long visit
aims to establish
partnerships
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily NewsEditor
0 While summer vacation now
seems like a distant memory for
students starting classes Tues-
day, University President Mary
Sue Coleman will commence a
vacation of her own in just a few
weeks.
On Sept. 22, Coleman -
accompanied by a delegation of
six faculty members and Mark
Tessler, the University's vice
provost forinternational affairs
- will embark on a week-long
trip to Brazil. The group will
travel to four cities - Sao Paulo,
Campinas, Rio de Janeiro and
Brasilia - and meet with aca-
demic and government offi-
cials.
"We have partnered with
Brazil for many years and wit-
nessed one of the most inter-
esting revolutions in higher
education," Coleman said in a
press release. "Brazil is not only
an emerging economy, it is an
r emerging power in research."

Associate History Prof.
Sueann Caulfield and Michele
Heisler, an associate profes-
sor of internal medicine, wrote
the proposal for the trip in the
spring of 2011 and are both
accompanying Coleman to Bra-
zil. Caulfield said the idea to
travel to the country came from
realizing the number of collab-
orative ventures the University
has established in Brazil.
"We realized that across
various areas we really have a
great deal of activity already
taking place in Brazil, but very
not connected to one another,"
Caulfield said "This is really the
first time that we have made
the connection."
Coleman has previously
traveled to China, Ghana and
South Africa on behalf of the
University. While in Brazil,
Coleman will formalize agree-
ments for collaborations with
various programs at the Uni-
versity and planning others,
including a theater program
and a joint project with the
medical school.
"Really great things hap-
pened after her trip to China
and after her trip to Africa, so
we're also really looking for-

Obama: Higher ed. key Biden critiques GOP
to economic recovery ticket in brash speech

By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
TOLEDO, Ohio - In a Labor
Day address held before a crowd
of about 3,100, President Barack
Obama compared Republican
presidential candidate Mitt
Romney to a football coach with
a plan "for a losing season" in
areas of education and industry.

Before an audience largely
comprised of union workers,
Obama stressed the economic
importance of receiving a col-
lege education, while showing
his support for unions and dis-
cussing the imposHce of job
creation. During his address at
Scott High School here, he con-
ceded his frustration with the

DETROIT - On a warm
Labor Day in the shadows of
skyscrapers, Vice President Joe
Biden spoke to thousands of
union supporters here Monday,
addressing the concerns of a city
defined by organized labor and
the auto industry.

Biden spent most of the
speech critiquing Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Rom-
ney, a Michigan native, and
his running mate, Paul Ryan.
Biden described Romney - who
wrote a piece for The New York
Times in 2008, famously titled
"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt" - as
indifferent to the working class

DailySportsEditor Countess suffered the injury
justfour minutes into the game
if the Michigan football while covering Michigan's punt
41-14, season-opening after the offense's first drive of
o Alabama on Saturday the game stalled. As the gun-

ner on the punt team, Countess
was knocked down hard by his
Crimson Tide counterpart and
landed awkwardly on his knee.
Countess had to be helped off
the field and used crutches to
enter the locker room after the
game ended.
"You hate to see (when) any-
body gets hurt," Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said on Monday,
reporting that the cornerback

will likely undergo surgery
within the next two weeks.
After he started the last six
games of the season last year
as a true freshman, totaling 44
tackles and six pass break-ups,
Countess seemed primed for a
breakout season in 2012. That
breakout will have to wait until
next year, when the Owings
Mills, Md. native will return
after taking a medical redshirt.

It's a big blow for the Michi-
gan defense, which loses an up-
and-comer at one of the most
important positions on the field.
But Hoke expressed confidence
that the rest of the cornerbacks
will be able to pick up the slack.
Junior Courtney Avery, nor-
mally the nickelback, will move
into the starting lineup opposite
fifth-year senior J.T. Floyd.

By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
LSA senior Jared Boot, a mem-
ber of the University's chapter of
College Republicans and chair
of Students for Romney at the
University, represents a seem-
ingly small and, as he says, often
misunderstood demographic on
campus - he is a gay Republican.
On a campus where a majority
of students identify as liberal and
many support gay rights, the con-
flict between his sexual orienta-
tion and political ideology is one
Boot often has to explain. Hoping
to dispel the notion among stu-
dents that members of the Col-
lege Republicans do not respect
gay rights, Boot and other group
members attended Gayz Craze
on Monday, an annual event
hosted by the LGBT Issues Com-
mission of Central Student Gov-
ernment.
Though the gesture was notan
endorsement of gay rights by the

New MCard features comnputer chip

17 years ago this week (Sepe. 5,
1995): ;For the start of fall semes-
ter, the University debuted a new
MCard that incorporated a comput-
er chip capable of storing student
information, The Michigan Daily
reported.
The card could also hold $50,
which could be used at campus
vending machines and for other ser-
vices at the University.
Randy Harris, associate, vice
president for finance, called the
new MCard "the card of the future"
and said it had the potential to offer
a variety of new enhancements to
student~life, the Daily reported...
"Eventually, if you want a pizza
delivered to your home they could
even have a hand-held device that

could read your card," Harris said.
10 years ago this week (Sept.
5, 2002): The Michigan Student
Assembly negotiated the Universi-
ty's first fall study break for the 2002
fall semester, the Daily reported.
The University became the first
school in Michigan to have a' fall
break, and the University's Board
of Regents approved the break as a
chance for students "to have a four
to five-day weekend for intense
studying and paper writing," the
Daily reported.
Despite the emphasis on using
the break for academic work, Law
student Chris Brown said students
primarilyouse it for other reasons.

5 years ago this week (Sept. 4,
2007): The University's chapter of
Theta Chi fraternity fated sanc-
tions after a partygoer shouted
racially offensive slurs at two black
Ann Arbor Police officers, the Daily
reported.
After investigating the house, the
officers found three, kegs of beer,
which violated regulations of both
the fraternity's_ national chapter
and the Interfraternity Council.
According to the Daily, "the fra-
ternity accepts responsibility for
anyone on its property," though an
anonymous Theta Chi brother said
the person who yelled the racial
slurs was not a member of the fra-
ternity.

FROM THE UALY
A cheat sheet for the news you need to know
C lasses begin Tuesday amidst a flurry of frantic text-
book purchases and last minute Meijer runs. It's
understandable if you're a bit overwhelmed. For those'
who joined the annual Ann Arbor exodus in May, it's easy to
become removed from the University and local Ann Arbor
happenings. However, The Michigan Daily is here to help
with a recap of what transpired in the past four months and a
guide of what to watch for this fall.

An introduction to the Daily

Where did the summer go? It seems like last semes-
ter's exams just ended, but here we are, starting anoth-
er school year. Whether you're new to the University
or have been here for decades, I want to use these col-
umn inches to introduce you to The Michigan Daily.
As media evolves, news organizations are often crit-
icized for being out of touch. At the Daily, we believe
in transparenc'y. This is your newspaper - the Daily is
produced by students with the University community
in mind: Hopefully, I'll answer any questions you have
about the Daily here, but please don't hesitate to get
in touch if you have any further questions. If you send
me an e-mail at Lichterman@michigandaily.com or
Tweet me at @ylichterman, I'll be happy to help you
out.
Who we are
The Michigan Daily is the largest student-runnews-
paper at the University. We've been publishing since
1890, and for all 122 years of production, the Daily has
been completely student run. There are some profes-
sionals who help our business staff (the group of stu-
dents who are responsible for generating revenue and
managing finances) but we are completely editorially
independent. A group of hardworking editors and I
are ultimately the ones responsible for what we pub-
lish every day, and that freedom is a responsibility we
take very seriously. Our mission is to be as fair and
accurate as possible and to only publish stories that
are pertinenttotthe University community.
When we stray from that mission
The design of our production process aims to get
every story right, but that doesn't always happen.
When we mess up, we wantto know about it. Please let
us know if you notice an error in the Daily. If there's
a mistake, we'll correct it online immediately and run
a correction on page 2 of the next day's print edition.
I can't reiterate it enough: We want to know when we
make mistakes - please e-mail corrections@michi-
gandaily.com or me directly to let us know about any
mistake.
Connect with the Daily
We love the Internet. It's changing and challeng-
ing traditional journalism and the way we do our jobs.
Disseminating news is faster and easier than ever, and
there's a more robust dialogue between sources, read-
ers and us. Follow us on Twitter (@michigandaily) or
like us on Facebook (Facebook.com/MichiganDaily).
Both are great ways to connectto the Daily or as away
to start a conversation about anything you see on our
website or in the paper.

There are also more traditional ways to let us
know what you're thinking. Letters to the editor can
be sent to tothedaily@michigandaily.com, and news
tips - which are always appreciated - can be sent to
news@michigandaily.com.
Several weeks ago, we launched TheBlockM.com,
the Daily's new sports-only website. TheBlockM.
com is meant to fuel your interest in Michigan sports
with up-to-the-minute coverage of every varsity sport
- from baseball to water polo. Follow TheBlockM
on Twitter at @TheBlockM and like it on Facebook
at Facebook.com/TheBlockM.com. The site is still a
work in progress, and we look forward to your input
as it evolves.

can't do our jobs of keeping you informed without
some help.
Thanks, and have a fantastic semester.

Editor in Chief

In a landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme
Court declared key provisions of President
Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act
constitutional (that'sright, CNN). Young adults
are now covered under their parents' health
insurance until the age of 26, giving students
one less thing to worry about as graduation
looms. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's adminis-
tration continues workingwith the federal gov-
ernment to set up a health exchange, and must
continue despite expected opposition.
At the final hour, Congress finally renewed
the College Cost Reduction and Access Act.
The student loan interest rate will remain at
3.4 percent, instead of doubling to 6.8 per-
cent. Hopefully, Obama will be able to work
with Congress to ensure this rate for more
than just a year, preventing unnecessary
gridlock and worry for students.
Back in the state of Michigan, the word
"vagina" made an appearance in almost
every casual conversation during the middle
of June. Rep. Lisa Brown (D-West Bloom-
field) was barred from speaking in the House
after a debate on an abortion bill in which she
said, "Finally Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that
you're all so interested in my vagina, but 'no'
means 'no."' The state legislature also spent
significant time attempting to pass voter ID
laws that would counter intuitively make it
more difficult to vote. Look for the Michigan

legislature to try and pass more extrgme and
exclusionary laws - though hopefully with-
out avail.
Here in Ann Arbor, all City Council wards
had open seats, making the competition
fierce - between Democrats, of course - in
the primaries. Voter turnout was minimal.
Sumi Kailasapathy won in Ward 1, Sally Hart
Peterson defeated the incumbent Tony Der-
ezinski, Margie Teall won in Ward 4 and
Chuck Warpehoski won in Ward 5.
At the University, the Board of Regents
voted to increase tuition rates by 2.8 percent
for in-state students and 3.5 percent for out-
of-state students for this school year.
The University Health System is no longer
accepting walk-ins. The new policy was con-
veniently put into place this summer when
many students left, so it remains to be seen
how students will react.
Look to The Michigan Daily for continued
news and opinion coverage of these issues.
The Michigan Daily represents you. Our staff
and editorial board are always advocating for
students. But, we can only do so much. Make
your voice heard and send Letters to the
Editor or Viewpoints to tothedaily@michi-
gandaily.com. With your input, the, Daily's
opinion page can become a forum for discus-
sion and every student can have the opportu-
nity to contribute to the conversation.

arlier this summer, I pre-
pared myself for the next
Bernie Madoff-like .scandal
to unfold in
the financial
industry. I'm
not a guru that
can predict big
events like this,
but it seems
that every sum-
mer some new ASHLEY
scandalor crisis GRIESSHAMMER
rocks the finan-
cial industry.
This was of particular interest
of me because I was going to be
working on investment banking at
a large international bank in New
York City. Essentially, the more
trouble the financial industry was
having, the more difficult my job
and the more hours I would work.
So what was this summer's head-
line story? London Interbank Offer
Rate, or as it's commonly called,
LIBOR. Oddly enough, many peo-
ple haven't heard of LIBOR before
this. The LIBOR scandal has been
considered one of the biggest in
history, but it hardly affected my
internship at all, and I rarely even
heard talk of it.
Maybe LIBOR didn't make every
news outlets' headlines since it's
not as close to home as Madoff's
Ponzi scheme or the U.S. debt ceil-
ing that rocked the markets last
summer. But though LIBOR hap-
pened mostly overseas, it should be
of concern to all Americans.
LIBOR should be on everyone's
radar. At its most basic level, it can
be explained as the rate at which
banks would lend money to one
another. This rate is an indicator of
banks' stability, and it can impact
profits. The lower a bank's rate is,

the more stable they're considered.
After the 40 included banks
report their rates, the highest and
lowest are discarded and the rest
are averaged. This sets the LIBOR
rate for the day.
The bank most commonly asso-
ciated with this scandal was Bar-
clays, but they weren't the only
ones involved. During the finan-
cial crisis, Barclays was report-
ing much higher rates than other
banks, making them appear less
stable. So instead of continuing to
report correct rates, they started
underreporting to make them-
selves look better. And, unfortu-
nately, other banks followed suit,
J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and
Bank of America.
These interest rates affected tril-
lions of dollars of financial prod-
ucts, making this a much bigger
deal than Madoff was. Some people
benefitted from the scandal, while
some were hurt. If you took out a
mortgage or a student loan when
rates were artificially low, then
congratulations, you're paying less
interest than you should be. But if
you did the same when rates were
artificially high, then you're prob-
ably paying more than what's fair.
As expected, those people who
believe they received an unfairly
higher rate are filing lawsuits,
including the city of Baltimore.
At its heart, the LIBOR system
relies on honesty - honesty from
banks, which evidently hasn't been
existent of late. The New York Fed-
eral Reserve was aware of the scan-
dal as it was brewing and offered a
variety of suggestions to change
the way LIBOR was set.
This could have happened some-
where other than London, too. In
addition to LIBOR, there is HIBOR

(Hong Kong Interbank Offered
Rate) and SIBOR (Singapore Inter-
bank Offergd Rate). With an entire
system based on honestly, there are
bound to be lies and Mistakes, not
just in London.
A system based
on honesty is
bound to fail.
The LIBOR scandal makes it
clear that the system needs to be
altered. After the financial cri-
sis, a system based on honesty
shouldn't have existed. And more
importantly, it should have been
widely publicized. While the
LIBOR scandal happened in Lon-
don, the rates affected financial
products in the United States, and
the scandal involved U.S. banks.
Our media sources didn't seem to
cover the issue like they have in the
past, even though LIBOR affected
a much larger amount of money.
While major financial news outlets
like CNBC covered the story, every
local station wasn't reporting on
the topic. Even if the event takes
place overseas, it can still affect
Americans, and should be given the
same magnitude of coverage had it
happened in the U.S.
If it can happen once, it can hap-
pen again - and for a system that
relies on honesty, it may not be the
best policy.

OBAMA
From Page 1A
Republican platform for ongoing
inattentiveness to students and
workers, particularly in light of
recent GOP comments at the par-
ty's convention last week.
Obama said Romney's recent
speech at the Republican Nation-
al Convention in Tampa, Fla.
wasn't innovative enough to solve
today's economic problems.
"You might as well have
watched it on black-and-white
TV, with some rabbit ears on
there," Obama joked. "Should
have been on 'Nick-at-Nite."'
The president continued, using
football jargon to describe that
Americans have already seen
Romney's flawed "economic play-
book." Obama said that from "first
down" to "third down," Romney's
plan favors wealthy Americans
and big companies instead of
helping the middle class and aid-
ing impoverished Americans.
"It sounds like unnecessary
roughness to me," Obama said,
noting that he would call a pen-
alty "flag on the play," since he
claimed Romney's health care
plan would force Americans
to pay $6,400 for benefits they
already receive.
"You don't need that coach,"
Obama said.
When much of the crowd
expressed displeasure with Rom-
ney by booing during mentions of
the candidate, Obama urged them
to show their discontent through
voting, repeating this call to
" action throughout his speech.
The United Auto Workers dis-
tributed tickets for the event and
UAW President Bob King, AFL-
CIO president Richard Trumka
and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis
helped rile up the crowd before
the president took the stage.
Obama used a frequent tactic
in his own playbook to appeal to
members of the auto industry,
which has a large presence here -
Toledo is home to Jeep
The president pointed out
Romney's previous opposition
to the bailout of Chrysler, which
owns Jeep, and General Motors.
"Just a few years ago, when
the auto industry was flat-lining,
what was in Governor Romney's
playbook?" Obama asked the
crowd. "Let Detroit go bankrupt."
Obama credited the survival
of the American auto industry
to opposing Romney's advice
and subsequently saving the jobs
of autoworkers in Toledo and
throughout the nation.
"If America had thrown in the
towel like that, GM and Chrys-

ward to her vision and thinking
about how we can build our cur-
rent efforts in Brazil," Heisler
said.
Tessler, who is also a politi-
cal science professor, helps make
decisions about where to go and
who to meet with on Coleman's
international trips.
"One of my responsibilities is
to help us strengthen and deepen
our international partnerships
with important universities over-
seas," Tessler said. "So I'm per-
sonally very interested in this,

and some of the things that we'll
be discussing are in my own area
as a faculty member."
The group will travel to Uni-
versidade de Sao Paulo - one
of the leading universities in
Brazil - the Universidade
Estadual de Campinas and the
Universidade Federal do Estado
do Rio de Janeiro, as well as the
U.S. embassy and other places
of interest like research foun-
dations, according to the press
release. The delegation, which
is comprised of faculty mem-
bers from the School of Natural
Resources, LSA and the Medical
School, will also participate in

ler wouldn't exist today," Obama
said. "The suppliers, and the dis-
tributors, that get their business
from these companies would
have died off, too. Then even Ford
could have gone down as well."
Obama said if the federal
government had let the Detroit
Three go bankrupt, it would have
essentially spurred another Great
Depression for many states in the
Midwest, including Michigan.
Obama decried Republicans for
what he said was an anti-union
attitude, noting that unionized
teachers, public safety employees
and manufacturing workers have
made some of the largest sacrific-
es of any profession in the United
States.
"It's a part of the same old
'you're-on-your-own, top-down'
policy that says we should just
leave everybody to fend for them-
selves," Obama said,
He added he'll discuss labor
rights in his address to delegates
at the Democratic National Con-
vention on Thursday, when he is
expected to accept the Democrat-
ic party's nomination for presi-
dent. Obama said he will offer a
strong defense against Romney's
labor policies that are harmful to
American unions.
Obama further criticized Rom-
ney for a remark he made in April
during a speech at Otterbein Uni-
versity in Westerville, Ohio where
he said young adults should "bor-
row money, if you have to, from
their parents" in order to pay for
college.
"That's one approach. I've got a
different approach," Obama said.
"Let's make sure Americans once
again lead the world in educating
our kids and training our workers
for the jobs of tomorrow."
Obama continued, saying that
American schools should hire
more teachers in math and sci-
ence, and urged individuals to
attend community colleges to
gain skills in advanced manufac-
turing.
"Some form of higher educa-
tion, that's not a luxury any-
more," Obama said. "That is an
economic necessity."
Speaking to the union mem-
bers in the room, Obama said
American unions have forged the
expectation that American work-
ers should be able to send their
children to college.
"(That) if you work hard, if
you're responsible, then your
work should be rewarded. That
if you put in enough effort, you
should be able to find a job that
pays the bills," Obama said. "...
And, most importantly then, you
can provide your children with
an education, to make sure that

they do even better than you did."
Andrew Devore, a freshman
at the University of Toledo and
a son of union members, said his
parents probably wouldn't have
been able to send him to his first
year of college, let alone pay the
rent at their current home, if the
auto companies had gone under.
"I'm not sure if we could have
made it past (the crisis) without
President Obama's help," Devore
said. "We might not have been
able to afford our house, our cars,
our education."
Devore, who is majoring in
education, said Romney's anti-
union attitude damages his
rapport with middle-class Ameri-
cans.
"It's easy to blame it on unions
when you don't need a union and
you're above it all and you've
already got money from your par-
ents," Devore said.
Jeanetta Mohlke-Hill, a senior
at the University of Toledo and
a local volunteer for the Obama
campaign, said she appreciated
Obama's jab at Romney's "bor-
row money from your parents"
remark.
She said she couldn't borrow
money from her parents for her
degree because her mother and
father are still paying off their
own student loans, and she will
likely graduate from college with
about $20,000 in student loan
debt.
"My parents can't give me
money, so that struck right to the
heart," Mohlke-Hill said.
Like Devore, Mohlke-Hill
said Romney doesn't understand
how difficult it is for the average
American to pay for their chil-
dren's education.
"He just doesn't understand
that we can't afford to go to col-
lege without some scholarships
or student loans," Mohlke-Hill
said. "Our parents just aren't
privileged to enough to send us to
any school we want."
Mark Carter, a graduate stu-
dent at the University of Toledo,
said he worked for Obama's cam-
paign on campus in 2008. He said
he will also probably leave college
with debt, and expressed concern
about Romney's plans for student
loan debt.
Carter added that there's a
significant push for federal assis-
tance with student loan debt
because, as he has experienced,
sometimes an undergraduate
degree isn't sufficient in this eco-
nomic climate.
"There are very few jobs
around this country that you can
get without a college education,"
Carter said. "It's not like the pre-
vious generation. It's important."

BIDEN
From Page 1A
and unfaithful to his promise of
increasing employment.
"Folks, you can't say you're
going to create jobs in the United
States of America, when you're
willing to let one million jobs go
under by liquidation of the auto-
mobile plants," Biden said.
Biden also addressed recent
claims by Ryan that Obama
was to blame for the closure
of a General Motors plant in
Ryan's hometown of Janesville,
Wisc. The plant actually closed
before Obama was elected, and
Biden was quick to point that
out, claiming that it was "actu-
ally closed on President Bush's
watch."
While Biden said he agreed
with Ryan that the economic
state of the country was dire, he
said Obama's role in it was quite
the opposite, claiming the presi-
dent's work has allowed more
automotive plants to remain
open.
"Before the sacrifices you
made - UAW members made
- before those sacrifices and
the courage of the president, all
the GM plants would have been
closed," Biden said.
The reason, Biden said, the
U.S. has made any recovery so
far is in large part because of
American workers. Specifically,
Biden cited a study claiming

Michigan workers were sig-
nificantly more productive than
their Chinese counterparts.
"Look folks, we know who
built this country, and we know
who's going to rebuild it - it's
you," he said. "And instead of vil-
ifying you, we should be thank-
ing you ... you - organized labor
- are one of the reasons why
this country is coming back."
Biden also spoke out against
right to work laws, which allow
employees to independently
decide to join or support a union
and make it illegal for business
to have contractual agreements
to employ strictly union mem-
bers.
"Right to work means the
right to work for less, not for
what you deserve," he said.
"Ladies and gentlemen, that's
not going to happen as long as
we're here - it will not happen."
Biden also refuted claims by
Romney that Obama was out of
touch and argued that Romney
was the aloof candidate, citing
his offshore financial arrange-
ments.
"How many of y'all have a
Swiss bank account? How much
you got invested in the Cayman
Islands?" Biden said of Romney.
While Biden's speech didn't
focus on foreign policy, it came
into play when Biden inquired
about why America is better off
today than four years ago, cit-
ing two key moments in Obama's
presidency.

"I've got a bumper sticker for
you," he said. "Osama Bin Laden
is dead and General Motors is
alive."
Biden would repeat that
phrase twice more before wrap-
ping up his speech.
The event, featuring several
speakers, began with a speech
by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-
Mich.), who is also running for
re-election this fall.
Stabenow spent an early por-
tion of her speech defending
and lauding Obama as one of the
people who "stood with Michi-
gan when no one else would."
She added if the country were
to stay with Obama, Michigan
- which has faced significant-
ly more hardships than other
states - would not only return,
but lead the return.
"We need to keep pushing
and pushing to make sure that
it comes back even faster, but we
have turned that corner," Stabe-
now said. "I believe that Amer-
ica, if we stay the course, will,
come roaring back and Michi-
gan will be in the driver's seat."
The crowd was responsive to
the speeches, often breaking out
in cheers and chants. The only
negative responsive came from
Biden's first mention of Rom-
ney and Ryan. Biden, however,
quickly turned the jeers into
applause.
"Folks, as the president says,
we don't need your boos. We
need your votes," Biden said.

alumni events.
At the University, the Center
for Latin American and Caribbe-
an Studies is assisting with many
of the University's Brazilian col-
laborations. Bebete Martins,
director of programming and
outreach at LACS and native Bra-
zilian, is also helping organize
events for the trip and assisting
students who are interested in
doing internships or study abroad
programs in Brazil.
Caulfield added that in addi-
tion to being a critical country
economically and politically to
the rest of the world, Brazil is also
important to Michigan because
automobile companies have
plantsin Brazil.
"President Coleman going to
Brazil sends a signal to people in
Michigan, not just students and
faculty, but also in the state of
Michigan, the importance of Bra-
zil and the importance of the Uni-
versity's globalization efforts and
makes it concrete," Caulfield said.
According to Caulfield and
Heisler, there will be more of
an effort made for students at
the University to have access to
experiences in Brazil, particular-
ly through emphasizinglanguage
programs like emphasize Portu-
guese to help alleviate obstacles
to communication.

"What we're going to be doing
also is really strengthening pro-
grams so that people - starting
with people who have some base
in Spanish - can bring their Por-
tuguese up to speed, so that more
students can take advantage of
these opportunities with lan-
guage training that they get here
at Michigan, and then they can
be part of some of these collabo-
rations," Heisler said.
During the winter semester,
Caulfield will be leading a course
titled "The History of Human
Rights in Latin America," which
will be co-taught with a profes-
sor in Brazil.
"We are going to use video
conferencing to have students
be in contact with one another,"
Caulfield said.
While the Medical School and
the president's office are primar-
ily funding the trip, Tessler said
after the trip is over the bulk of
the funding will be made from
various parts of the University
for the collaborations.
"One of the things that's very
encouraging is that (the Bra-
zilians) value the University of
Michigan and what we have to
offer, and they're very interested
in providing funds for research,"
Tessler said. "We'll probably put
up some funds for that as well."

Ongoing violence
plagues Middle
Eastern nation
BEIRUT (AP) - Activist
groups said Sunday that about
5,000 people were killed in
Syria's civil war in August, the
highest figure ever reported in
more than 17 months of fight-
ing as President Bashar Assad's
regime unleashed crushing air
power against the revolt for the
first time.
The U.N. children's fund UNI-
CEF put the death toll for last
week alone at 1,600, the larg-
est weekly figure for the entire
uprising.
"The past month witnessed
large massacres and the regime
was conducting wide operations
to try to crush the uprising,"
said Omar Idilbi, a Cairo-based
activist with the Local Coordi-
nation Committees group. "Last
month's acts of violence were
unprecedented."
He said the increased use
of the air force and artillery
bombardments was behind the
spike in casualties.
The civil war witnessed a
major turning point in August
when Assad's forces began
widely using air power for the
first time to try to put down the
revolt. The fighting also reached
Syria's largest city, Aleppo,
which had been relatively quiet
for most of the uprising.
The Britain-based activist
group Syrian Observatory for
Human Rights said that 5,440
people, including 4,114 civil-
ians were killed in August.
The LCC put the toll at 4,933
civilians.
On Sunday, the Observa-
tory and the LCC said more
than 100 people were killed
throughout Syria and the
groups have been reporting
100-250 deaths per day over
the past week.
Syria's uprising has been the
bloodiest in the Arab Spring
that has already removed'long-
serving authoritarian leaders
in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and
Libya.
The two main activists
groups also released new
death tolls for the entire
uprising since March 2011.
The Observatory said more
than 26,000 have been killed,
including more than 18,500
civilians. The LCC put the
death toll at more than 23,000
civilians. The LCC does not
count members of the military
who are killed, but the Observa-
tory does.
That averages out to about
1,300-1,500 deaths per month,
making the August figure more
than three times higher than
average.
The groups had previously

reported a toll of around 20,000
more than a month ago.
On Thursday, Human Rights
Watch said government forces
have killed scores of civilians
over the past three weeks by
bombarding at least 10 areas
where they were lining up to
buy bread at bakeries near and
around Aleppo.
Last week, activists reported
that between 300 and 600 peo-
ple were killed in the Damascus
suburb of Daraya during days of
shelling and a killing spree by
troops who stormed the town
after heavy fighting.
"The reason behind the high
death toll is military operations,
shelling, clashes and air raids,"
said Rami Abdul-Rahman who
heads the-Observatory.
"I would say most people are
being killed during clashes and
executions," he said referring to
scores of bodies that are found
in streets around Syria who are
shot execution style with a bullet
in the back of their heads.
UNICEF spokesman Patrick
McCormick said 1,600 were
killed last week alone, includ-
ing some children. He did not
immediately explain how he
arrived at the figure, but said
the number was documented.
As the death toll mounted,
international efforts to end the
crisis faltered badly. The U.N.
and Arab League have both led
prolonged but ultimately failed
efforts to negotiate an end to
the violence.
Turkey this week called for
the U.N. to authorize creation
of a safe zone in Syria for tens of
thousands fleeing their homes.

Britain and ,France have left
open the possibility of more
aggressive action, including a
military-enforced no-fly zone to
protect a safe area- thoughthat
still seems a remote possibility.
Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N.'s
new envoy to Syria, told Assad's
regime on Saturday that change
is both "urgent" and "neces-
sary" and that it must meet the
"legitimate" demands of the
Syrian people, words that will
not win the seasoned Algerian
diplomat and international
trouble shooter any friends in
Damascus.
On his first day on the job,
Brahimi also called on both sides
to end violence in Syria, but said
Assad's government bears more
responsibility than anyone else
to halt the bloodshed.
While the military largely
has been able to quell the offen-
sive rebels launched in Damas-
cus in July, it is still struggling
to stamp out a rebel push in the
northern city of Aleppo.
In the latest violence on Sun-
day, the Observatory said the
military pounded rebel hold-
outs in Aleppo, the country's
commercial capital. There was
also fighting in other areas
including the central city of
Homs, Idlib province on the
border of Turkey and suburbs
near Damascus.
The Observatory said 21
people were killed when troops
stormed the village of Alfan in
the central province of Hama.
It added that eight people were
killed in the oil-rich eastern
province of Deir el-Zour that
borders Iraq.

Figt over BA unionization
conitinues on national stage

National Labor
Relations Board
split along party
lines
By PETER SHAHIN
'laily Staff Reporter
As dust settles on the Uni-
versity's battle over gradu-
ate student research assistant
unionization, a new front is
opening at the National Labor
Relations Board over the sta-
tus of graduate students at the
nation's private universities.
In July, the NLRB's mem-
bers split in a 3-1 vote to review
its own 2004 ruling prevent-
ing graduate students at private
universities from unionizing.
The vote, divided between the
three Democratic members of
the NLRB and the lone Repub-
lican, is the latest in a series
of reviews of an issue with a
decades-long history.
Though debates over gradi-
ate student unionization at pri-
vate universities have occurred
since the 1980s, a regional
NLRB administrator ruled in
2000 that graduate student
teaching assistants did, in fact,
have the right to collectively
bargain. However, in 2004, the
NLRB itself, then dominated
by appointees of former presi-
dent George W. Bush, ruled
that the teaching and research
components of a graduate stu-
dent's duties were secondary to
their primary ole as students.
Graduate students in private
universities were not afforded
the protections of the National
Labor Relations Act.
The latest case involves the
United Auto Workers, which
is representing the graduate
students of New York Univer-
sity in contest with the school's
administration. The precedent
setting cases in 2000 and 2004
involved these same parties,
Brown Unversity.
NYU, the UAW and the Poly-
technic Institute of NYU have
submitted written legal argu-
ments to theNLRB, which will
review th documents. Grant-
ing graduate students collective
bargaining rights would reverse
the body's 2004 decision.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, former NLRB
Chairman Robert Battista-who
oversaw the 2004 ruling - said
though the composition of the
board has changed, he doesn't
believe the partisan shift of
the NLRB from predominantly
Republican to Democratic will
matter for this case.
Battista said by custom, three
members of the board are of the
President's party and two rep-
resent the opposition. Recently,
the U.S. Senate has been the

scene of intense partisan battles
over the appointment of new
members to the NLRB, and as a
result, only four members are on
the board.
"You're always goingto have a
board made of Republicans and
Democrats, but it just has to do
with how the issues come up,"
Battista said. "I don't believe
it has anything to do with the
party in power."
Battista said the UAW was
simply following protocol in
appealing its case to the highest
body possible after a regional
official enforced the 2004 rul-
ing.
However, Brian Hayes, the
sole Republican NLRB mem-
ber and dissenting voice on the
decision to review, posted his
opinion on the NLRB website,
stating there was no substantive
change warranting review of the
2004 ruling.
"The asserted compelling
reason for reconsidering Brown
(the 2004 ruling) consists of
nothing more than a change in
the Board's membership," Hayes
wrote. "Thus, the request for
review in this case and Poly-
technic simply recycle argu-
ments made by the dissenters
and rejected by the majority in
Brown."
In a press release, John Beck-
man, a NYU spokesman, called
the decision to review the status
of the graduate students for the
third time in "roughly a dozen
years" unsettling and unwar-
ranted.
Beckman noted that while the
2000 case only dealt with grad-
uate student teaching assistants,
in the most recent case, the
UAW chose to include graduate
student research assistants.
"The inclusion of research
assistants this time around
- they were excluded in 1999
at the request of the UAW -
is a particularly worrisome
development for higher educa-
tion," Beckman wrote. "What
research assistants do is inex-
tricably connected to their
personal research and their
pursuit of their degrees, and
unionization of RAs would
raise serious concerns about
bringing collective bargaining
into the middle of academic
decision-making."
The UAW did not respond to
requests for comment.
While the NLRB regulates
only private universities, this
new review highlights the
national debate regarding the
role of graduate students as stu-
dents or employees.
Public universities are regu-
lated by state-level labor rela-
tions boards. The Michigan
Employment Relations Com-
mission regulates the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
At the University, there
appears to be a lull in the battle

over graduate research assistant
unionization after a definitive
ruling by the Michigan Court of
Appeals on Aug. 16 stating that
the immediate effect portion of
House Bill 4246 is indeed legal,
and therefore prevents gradu-
ate student research assistants
from forming a union.
Rackham student Stephen
Raiman, founder of Students
Against GSRA Unionization,
said that in the wake of the
favorable judicial outcome,
SAGU is in a holding pattern
awaiting further developments.
"I'm happy that we won't
have the state government
interfering with our educa-
tions," Raiman said. "We're
uninterested in playing politics.
We're interested in being gradu-
ate students."
However, Raiman said he is
concerned about a proposed
state ballot initiative to expand
protections for collective bar-
gaining, which could give grad-
uate student research assistants
at the University the leverage
to challenge HB 4246. The pro-
posal is tentatively on the ballot
for the November election - fol-
lowing a ruling by the Board of
State Canvassers -butwill like-
ly be reviewed by the Michigan
Supreme Court before the Sept.
7 deadline for ballot initiatives.
In relation to the NLRB
review, Raiman acknowl-
edged there are fundamental
differences between the role
of teaching assistants and
research assistants within
universities throughout the
country, and should therefore
be approached differently. He
added that SAGU plans to leave
a "blueprint" for how to oppose
research assistant unioniza-
tion elsewhere.
"We are interested in help-
ing graduate students who
encounter the same threat in
the future," Raiman said. "We
do feel that these unions are
moving into a territory that they
shouldn't be moving.
Rackham student Liz
Rodrigues, communications
co-chair for the, Graduate
Employees Organization, said
despite the ruling by the Court
of Appeals, GEO is still working
to address the needs of research
assistants regardless of their
relatively limited bargaining
position.
According to Rodrigues, GEO
is working with other state
unions to support the ballot
initiative that expands collec-
tive bargaining protections,
which could affect the ability of
GSRAs to unionize.
Rodrigues added that even
though GEO is not direct-
ly involved with the NLRB
review, the organization sup-
ports the right of graduate stu-
dents at private universities to
unionize.

rally at Big House event

8,500 enjoy free
food, festivities at
stadium
By ALICIA ADAMCYZK and
MATT SLOVIN
Daily Staff Reporter and Daily
SportsEditor
The first football game of the
season may not have been played
in Michigan Stadium, but the
Center for Campus Involvement
ensured that students had the
change to experience the game
from the Big House even though
Michigan was taking on Alabama
in Texas.
About 8,500 students trekked
to the Big House Saturday night
to watch Alabama throttle the
Wolverines, 41-14, at Cowboys
Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
Titled 'Go Blue at the Big House',
the event included a pep rally,
games, activities and free food as
students watched the game from
the stadiumvideoboards.
Students could only be admit-
ted to the Big House with a valid
MCard, and were then ushered
through the Michigan Stadium
tunnel and onto the 50-yard line,
where the festivities kicked off
with games and giveaways, live
music and photo opportunities
with Michigan athletes.
The festivities weren't

restricted to the Big House, as
North Campus hosted a block
party from noon to 5 p.m., where
about3,500 students enjoyed live
music, free food, a host of games
and activities and a portable zip-
line. Students could also paint
signs and posters to take to the
stadium.
Mary Beth Seiler, director of
Greek Life at the University, said
the event was a great way for stu-
dents to start the year.
"I don't think they had any,
idea how many (students) would
show up," Seiler said. "But it's a
great turn out, beautiful weather
and a great way to see the game."
Roger Simpson, vice president
of operations for Huron Valley
Ambulance, said that though
alcohol is typically a concern at
football games, Saturday's event
went off without a hitch.
"Things have run smooth as
a well-oiled watch," Simpson
said.
Doors opened at 6 p.m. before
the pep rally led by men's bas-
ketball coach John Beilein at 7
p.m., during which Michigan
Olympic athletes were honored
for their performances in Lon-
don last month.
Students were then ushered
to seats where they watched
the team play in the Cowboys
Classic on the new videoboards,
while activities and games con-
tinued on the field.

LSA freshman Jason Roz-
bruch said the event was a great
way to meet new people.
"As a freshman, it's only my
third day here but it's nice that
this event is reuniting all of the
Michigan students," Rozbruch
said. "I'm having a good time so
far."
Engineeringgraduatestudent
Abhijith Kini said he attended to
experience the atmosphere in
the stadium.
"Even for a game not at home,
so many people are here, so I
don't think any other school
could have this," Kini said.
Deb Mexicotte, assistant
director of the Office of . New
Student Programs, said that the
block party on North Campus
was a success.
"It's always a challenge when
you put on something of this
scale, and this is an event we
haven't done before,' Mexicotte
said. "I think thatthis event will
be a great template for looking at
music festivals and the way that
we can do them at this campus
in the future."
Engineering freshman
Shwetha Hariharan said she
attended to try-out the zipline,
but engaged in the other events
as well.
"I think this is a good idea,
people meeting other people
and making new friends," Hari-
haran said.

University denied Aurora, Coo.
shooter from Rackham in 2011

Suspect described
as Asian male, fled
toward Hill St.
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
A female student was sexually
assaulted near the 1800 block of
Washtenaw Ave and Hill St. early
Monday morning, according to a
crime alert released by the Uni-
versity's Department of Public

Safety.
The Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment said when the student
approached her off-campus
residence, an unknown man
jumped behind her and grabbed
her chest and crotch. After the
student screamed, the suspect
retreated on foot in the direction
of Hill Street.
The suspect was an Asian
male who appeared to be in his
early 20s and was wearing a
baseball cap, according to the
crime alert.

Lt. Renee Bush,AAPD'spublic
information officer, said the stu-
dent was not physically injured
in the incident.
She added the AAPD will
send the incident to its detective
bureau for further investigation.
Additional support will be pro-
vided to the survivor of the inci-
dent, and to also further protect
the area where it occurred.
"At this point, what we nor-

Holmes applied
to neuroscience
graduate program
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
DailyNewsEditor
The University denied a 2011
graduate school application from
James Holmes, the 24-year-old
charged in the mass shooting
that took place at an Aurora, Colo.
movie theater in July, according
to University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald said in an interview
on Friday that Holmes applied
to the University's neuroscience
graduate program in 2011 and
wasdenied admission.Heoffered

no further information regarding
why the application was denied,
and the document has not been
released to the public.
Holmes killed 12 people and
injured 58 when he opened fire at
a midnight showing of "The Dark
Knight Rises," the third install-
ment of Christopher Nolan's Bat-
man trilogy, on its opening night
on July 20.
The University of Iowa
released Holmes' application to
its neuroscience graduate pro-
gram, which was also denied.
After Holmes had an admissions
interview there, the program's
director wrote an urgent e-mail
to the admissions committee
stating, "Do NOT offer admission
under any circumstances."
A spokesperson for the Uni-

versity of Iowa said Holmes was
academically qualified for the
program, but was not "a good
personal fit."
The University of Illinois
accepted Holmes' application
to a similar program, offering
him free tuition and a $22,000
yearly stipend. His Iowa applica-
tion stated that he also applied to
Texas A&M University, the Uni-
versity of Kansas, the University
of Alabama and the University of
Colorado Denver where he even-
tually enrolled to pursue a Ph.D.
in neuroscience.
Holmes left the program at
UC Denver six weeks before the
Aurora shooting.

By ADAM RUBENFIRE
DailyNewsEditor
After catching fire Thursday,
a trailer containing roofing sup-
plies near East Quad Residence
Hall was again seen "smoking"

early Friday morning, according
to the crime incident log of the
University's Department of Pub-
lic Safety.
The smoke was reported at
about 1:28 a.m. Friday morning.
The Ann Arbor Fire Department
responded and "flooded the
trailer with water," according to
DPS. No injuries or other dam-
age were reported.
The trailer had already caught
fire at 5:30 p.m Thursday. Offi-

cials were unsure of the exact
cause of the first fire, but AAFD
Battalion Chief Robert Vogel
said it was likely started when
steel being cut at the worksite
was placed near the rubber roof-
ing supplies, causing them to
overheat and catch fire.
As for the second incident,
fire officials confirmed they
responded to a call in -the area,
but were unsure of the cause of
the smoke.

"Go On," may not be remarkable,
Perry is the perfect lead to carry
the new series and charm audi-

One of the less irksome promos
during NBC's Olympics cover-
age this summer featured Perry
leading a support group meeting
with Olympic gymnast Shawn
Johnson. What was completely
unclear in those promos was
the role of these support group
meetings on the show, but the
pilot wastes no time in setting
it up. Perry plays Ryan King, a
radio sportscaster who ends up at
mandatory group therapy to cope
with the death of his wife. At

larceny, assault or some This may sound absurd and
mid-level crime. Though unconstitutional, but it's hap-
re no known connections pening to one group of music
en the crimes - which fans. The Juggalos - fans of
he entire country and near- Michigan-based horrorcore rap-
I decade - the FBIbelieves pers Insane Clown Posse - are

being targeted by the FBI, and
have actually been placed in
company with Crips and Bloods.
But the Juggalos are fight-
ing back. At the annual "Gath-
ering of the Juggalos" event in
Illinois - a music festival cel-
ebrating all things ICP - band
members Violent J and Shaggy
2 Dope announced their plans
to sue the FBI. They've created
a website where Juggalos can
tell their stories and promised
to have their legal team review
each case pro bono.
. While only four states have
officially classified the group
as a gang, the lawsuit brings up
questions about equality before
the law. Part of the mystique of
the ICP, at least for the'Juggalos,
is that they welcome people who
might be considered outcasts.
Many call themselves "scrubs"
- they're the kids who were
beaten up in high school or came
from broken families. Violent J,
real name Joe Bruce, came from
poverty himself, but decided to
embrace the stigma rather than
fight it. He began calling himself
a"floob" and was proud of it. ICP
grew mostly due to their will-
ingness to embrace "floobs" and
"scrubs," and while it makes for
an unusual crowd, it has given
many a sense of belonging.
Where equality becomes an
issue is the broad net that the
FBI is using. The FBI's 2011
National Gang Threat Assess-
ment of the Juggalos is painfully
vague including conclusions
like "Most crimes committed by
Juggalos are sporadic, disorga-
nized, individualistic, and often
involve simple assault, personal
drug use and possession, petty
theft, and vandalism." Do no
other groups of music fans use
drugs, get in fights or vandalize?
The report also states that
"Juggalos' disorganization and
lack of structure within their
groups, coupled with their tran-
sient nature, makes it difficult
to classify them and identify
their members and migration
patterns." So what the FBI is
saying is that they don't have
enough information to know
who they are or their "migration
patterns," but they still know
they're a gang? This is a blatant
violation of the American justice
system, and their righteous fight
should be supported.
With such a large number
of fans - 20,000 attended the
2009 Gathering - it's inevitable
that some of those people will be
committing "sporadic, disorga-
nized, individualistic" crimes.
And statistically speaking, based
on where they were raised, the
average Juggalo is more likely
to have a criminal record. But
that's no excuse for deserting
police work and naming every
fan a gang member. If ICP fans
can be classified as a gang, why
not classify dubstep fans as the
same? Go to a Bassnectar show
and try to tell me you can't find
drugs, vandalism or the occa-
sional assault.
To many, this issue isn't seri-
ous or worthy of attention. The
Juggalos aren't the most glam-
orous group, and are often the
butt of the joke in a lot of plac-
es. But while you're laughing
about the FBI taking down the
most scorned group of fans in
America, maybe take a second
to inspect your own iTunes. You

never know which group will be

COUNTESS
From Page 1A
"Courtney's a seasoned veter-
an," Hoke said. "I think with him
and (sophomore Raymon Taylor)
and Terry Richardson, the young
freshman, all three of those guys
are guys that we've counted on to
be able to step up and play."
When Countess exited the
game against the Crimson Tide,
Avery initially replaced him, but
he was soon pulled in favor of
Taylor after failing to slow down
Alabama's receivers.
The Tide appeared to specifi-
cally pick on Avery, twice throw-
ing to his side of the field in his
first two series.
Avery looked particularly bad
on a 51-yard touchdown pass in
the first quarter, when he slipped
while trying to defend Alabama
receiver DeAndrew White's dou-
ble move. White was left wide
open streaking down the right
sideline, and quarterback A.J.
McCarron found him easily for
the score.
"Courtney has a lot of experi-
ence, you know," Hoke said. "He's
played a lot of football here.... We
trust Courtney. That's the biggest
issue."
Going into the season, corner-
back appeared to be one of the
Wolverines' strongest positions
depth-wise. But Countess's inju-
ry and the transfer of Terrance
Talbott over the summer leaves
sophomore Delonte Hollowell as
the only additional scholarship
corner.
As for. the nickelback slot,
which is now vacant with Avery's
ascendance tothe startinglineup,
Hoke said he might choose to
simply keep redshirt junior safe-
ty Thomas Gordon in the game
instead of removing him in favor
of another cornerback. But he
didn't rule out the possibility of
using another cornerback for the
role, either.

The fact that Countess was
injured on special teams calls into
question Michigan's use of him
on that unit, given thathis role on
defense is more important than
his duties as punt gunner.
But Hoke expressed no regrets
about using a player of Countess's
caliber on the puntteam.
"We try and only putguys who
are only going to play significant
time on two teams," Hoke said.
"And the rationale is it's one-third
of the football game, and you bet-
ter have guys who are capable
and guys you think are your best
players. So the rationale is you're
going to win the kicking game
also."
NOTES:.Hoke also announced
that fifth-year senior tight end
Brandon Moore will miss this
week's game, against Air Force
after spraining his MCL on Sat-
urday night. He'll be replaced by
former walk-on and fifth-year
senior tight end Mike Kwiat-
kowski, and the freshman tandem
of Devin Funchess and A.J. Wil-
liams. All three players appeared
against Alabama.
Redshirt junior offensive tack-
le Taylor Lewan, on the other
hand, will play against Air Force
even though he also had to leave
Saturday's game after injuring his
leg in the fourth quarter. Hoke
said Lewan has a bruise, and he
said it isn't serious.
Redshirt junior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint and
sophomore defensive end Frank
Clark will also play on Saturday,
according to Hoke. Each was sus-
pended for the Alabama game due
to separate legal matters.
After Devin Gardner received
heavy playing time at wide
receiver on Saturday night, Hoke
confirmed that the junior is now
essentially at that position full-
time and will play quarterback
only in certain situations. Gard-
ner said he just considers himself
a "football player," and will play
wherever he can help the team.

building when residents moved
in August. New dance and fitness
studios are not finished, but will
be complete within the next few
weeks, Logan added.
LSA sophomore Jamie Nadel,
who lived in Couzens Residence
Hall last year and now lives in
Alice Lloyd with fellow LHSP
students, said he likes how the
residence hall reflects the charac-
ter of LHSP, which is celebrating
its 50th anniversary this year.
"I thought it was very inter-
esting that they decided to make
it look very 60s, because that's
when the building was made, and
that's when the LHSP program
started," Nadel said. " ... I think
they're really trying to go back to
that style and engross us in this
idea of the anniversary. That is a
really interesting portion of liv-
ing here."
He added that the dorm is very
"eclectic" because of the variety
of furniture, colors and designs.
"All of the rooms are big and
beautiful and just amazing look-
ing. I don't know how they could
have made it better," Nadel said.
Though Alice Lloyd does
not have a multipurpose room
for large group gatherings like
Couzens did, Monville said there
are plenty of other spaces, such
as study rooms and lounges, to
use for group work.
LSA freshman Taylor Sullivan
said that since classes haven't
started, many of the new study
rooms and lounges have been
empty.
"I think it would be better if
there were more people here.
There are never people in the
lounges," Sullivan said. "I think
everyone is new to it, and a lot
of people don't know where to
go. Hopefully, there will be more
people out and about throughout
the year."
Sullivan said she also had the
opportunity to see the new, six-
person suites while participating
in Move-In Makers - a program
where students arrive on cam-
pus early to assist other residents
moving in - and was impressed
with the rooms.
While the number of Uni-
versity Housing spaces was a
concern for many students last
winter, Logan said no first-year
students were displaced due to

the construction on East Quad
Residence Hall, which housed
approximately 850 students last
year, and the closing of Baits I
Residence Hall, which housed
about 570 students.
Though no students were dis-
placed, there were about 400
fewer bed spaces this year. How-
ever, most returning students
who completed a housing appli-
cation this year were able to still
live on campus after Northwood
apartments I and II were con-
verted from housing for graduate
students to housing for under-
graduate students.
Logan also said the housing
committee was able to make up
for unavailable space by convert-
ing Northwood III into h housing
community for first-year stu-
dents, and Housing is currently
workingto add wireless Internet
access in all Northwood apart-
ments.
"It probably wasn't, for many
of them, their first choice.
Although there are a number of
the sophomore and older stu-
dents who do like the apartment
living, so it worked out fine,"
Logan said. "Those who wanted
to stick through the sign-up pro-
cess and live on campus, we were
able to find a place for them."
Logan said the renovations on
East Quad are on schedule, and
the building is planned to re-
open in the fall after a 15-month
renovation.
The University's housing staff
has also been doing preliminary
planning for future renovations
of other residence halls as part
of a continuation of the RLI,
according to Logan.
"We feel there is an oppor-
tunity to do some considerable
work in South Quad Residence
Hall, and we're looking at oppor-
tunities to do renovation work
within West Quad Residence
Hall after that," Logan said.
He added that Baits II also
received many renovations over
the summer to improve commu-
nity spaces, including the addi-
tion of a fitness room, a theatre,
a piano lounge and a room with a
green screen.
"It's been an extremely busy
summer," Logan said. "The work
done by housing staff in main-
tenance, custodial service, and
of course housing planning and
design has just been phenome-
nal. They have put in an Olympic
effort this year."

As Hoke alluded to, Michi-
gan's offensive line was at

against the stout Crimson Tide

ing something out of nothing,
and still, he remained unused

The quarterback didn't see it

Gardner smoke screen proves ineffectivem

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
ARLINGTON,, Texas - They
were laughing, and it was only
the first quarter. There were
five minutes left in the quarter
when Alabama scored its second
touchdown, and one Alabama fan
glanced up at the scoreboard and
broke into a joyful laughter, and
he did it on a video board 159 feet
long.
The camera jumped to a set of
pretty girls in a box dressed up in
more formal attire. They smiled
wide, until they too started
laughing.
It was over already, and they
knew it, knew it because Michi-
gan's game plan relied more on
smoke than substance. Without
a feature running back, Michi-
gan turned to last-minute decep-
tion. The offensive plan called
for senior quarterback Denard,
Robinson to win the game with
his arm, but his go-to target on
Saturday was his roommate,
Devin Gardner, a converted
quarterback whose inexperience
showed.
The smoke didn't hold up, not
against mighty Alabama. Michi-
gan's attempt was so futile, and
-the drubbing so efficient, that the
Alabama fans smiled so hard that
they laughed, and the first quar-
ter wasn't even over.
"On both sides of the ball,"
said Michigan coach Brady Hoke
after the game. "It was bad on
both sides of the ball."
After it was over, Gardner, the
one who was supposed to be a
difference maker, received a pat
from a Alabama cornerback Dee
Milliner and then walked off, his
face blank. He jogged into the'
tunnel alone, finally free from
the secondary that blanketed
him almost all night.
Hoke and offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges played coy with
Gardner's status in the spring,
declining to say outright wheth-
er or not Gardner would play at
receiver. During fall camp, they
conceded he'd play some but

Junior wide receiver Devin Gardner caught his first career touchdown pass against Alabama on Saturday.

didn't detail how much.
In fact, the moves actually did
cause confusion. Alabama line-
backer. Nico Johnson said the
Tide had no way of preparing for
Gardner.
"You don't (prepare for a play-
er like Gardner)" Johnson said.
"We kind of just went over all the
possibilities, and that's what we
did and just went from there."
That confusion just never
translated to the field. Milliner
harassed Gardner all game. He
knocked an early pass away on
a slant, ran with him step for
step on a fade, and countered an
impressive leaping attempt with
perfect defensive positioning.
"My teammates were just like,
'Why are they picking on you?'"
Milliner said.
Robinson went at Milliner
starting from Michigan's first
snap. On that play, Gardner ran
a slant, and Robinson delivered a
strike, and Gardner dropped the
ball.
Robinson tried Gardner again
on the next drive, this time a
third-down fade. Gardner was
open, and Robinson floated
it toward the sideline. Gard-

ner, though, drifted toward the
middle of the field, and couldn't
adjust to the properly-placed
pass.
Two more times, Gardner's
inexperience prevented a recep-
tion. buring one route, Gardner
stopped his route, and Robin-
son's pass sailed long as a result.
In the third quarter, Gardner
turned over the wrong shoulder,
and when he adjusted, he ran
into an Alabama defensive back.
Incomplete.
"I'm glad they did what they
did," Milliner said. "I was just
prepared and ready to make
plays."
Milliner and Gardner fiist
met years ago during an Under
Armour high school game, back
when Milliner was a young cor-
nerback trying to improve his
craft and his stock and Gard-
ner was a burgeoning quarter-
'back. On Saturday, as Gardner
tried to beat Milliner with his
legs instead of his arm, Milli-
ner said he talked trash with his
good friend. After the game, his
superiority established, Milliner
was optimistic about Gardner's
future.

"He looked like a normal
receiver to me," said Milliner.
"He had great routes, he was,
physical at the line of scrimmage
when they had to block."
Gardner flashed that poten-
tial, but only once. His jab step
in the third quarter froze the
cornerback, who fell to the turf,
and sprung Gardner to a 44-yard
touchdown reception. Even then,
though, Gardner had to adjust
after turning awkwardly over
the wrong shoulder, and with the
touchdown, Alabama still led,
34-14.
Gardner was one of Robinson's
favorite targets, with seven balls
thrown his way. His touchdown
reception-was his only catch.
"I think Devin's a.pretty spe-
cial athlete," Hoke said. "To get
another athlete on the field helps
us."
Hoke and Michigan counted
on that extra dose of athleticism,
especially in the absence of sus-
pended running back Fitzger-
ald Toussaint. With Toussaint,
the redshirt junior, left in Ann
Arbor, Michigan turned to senior
Vincent Smith and sophomore
Thomas Rawls.

No one outside of the Michi-
gan team knew of Toussaint's
suspension until Friday after-
noon, right before Michigan
boarded the team plane to Dal-
las. Hoke had waited until the
day before the game to announce.
No matter who carried the
ball, though, no one found any
daylight. Smith gained 37 yards
on 13 carries, Rawls managed
just 11 yards on 6 touches, and
even Robinson was limited to
just 37 yards.
Like the Gardner move, the
late announcement of Tous-
saint's suspension affected the
Tide's preparations. Alabama's
players prepare breakdowns of
the opposition each week. On
Thursday, Johnson, the line-
backer, stood in front of the team
and addressed the tendencies of
Michigan's running backs. First
on his list? Toussaint
"It kind of messed my tenden-
cies up," Johnson said. "It was a
big deal for this game, because
the way we game plan was on
certain running backs. Because
(Smith), he's ta more shifty back
than (Toussaint) is, so it's kind
of difficult with him in it because
we didn't really prepare for him
all week."
Didn't matter. Alabama's sub-
stance stomped Michigan's flash,
and by the second half, the Ala-
bama side of the stadium had
already begun celebrating the
first step on the way to another
national championship run.
They beamed. They high-fived
and drank and waved pom poms.
One woman rubbed her eyes with
her fists and mocked a crying
face on the big screen.
Inside the Alabama interview
room with glass windows facing
the field, Milliner talked about
what it was like to be challenged
by Michigan with a player who
had never.played a snap at receiv-
er.
On the glass, Alabama fans
yelled "Roll Tide" and chanted
"S-E-C" and smiled, as the cel-

making continued.

That's when Robinson went
down hard after taking a big
hit while extending for the first
down on a scramble.
Whether it was fear of fur-
ther injury, or the thought that
the Wolverines needed to use
the passing game if they had
any hope of coming back from a
34-7 deficit, his running essen-
tially ceased for good after he
returned.
"I thought with the running
back being out, I thought (Robin-
son) would've got more touches,
because he's a playmaker, he's a
good athlete, good player," said
Alabama linebacker Nico John-
son.
"And I don't know, it was a
shock."
Johnson said the game plan
was to keep Robinson in the
pocket, and they did well in
doing so.
Perhaps, then, the quarter-
back's woes on the ground can be
partially explained by his inabil-
ity to make Alabama respect him
through the air, save for the-pass
to Gallon and a 44-yard touch-
down to junior Devin Gardner.
Overall, he went just 11-for-26
with two interceptions.
Robinson didn't question the
game plan, instead saying he and
his teammates just needed to
improve.
"Everybody has to focus up
and listen to our coaches," Rob-
inson said.
"I know Coach Borges has a
lot to say to me, because I didn't
play well."

total carries.
"They did exactly what we
thought they'd do," said fifth-
year senior safety Jordan Kovacs.
"They tried to run it down our
throats and that's what happened.
There wasn't anything pretty
about what they did today. They
just played some smash-mouth
football and beat us."
It wasn't until a field goal and a
20-yard interception return for a
touchdown that Michigan finally
cut into the 31-0 deficit. Robinson
put Michigan on the board with a
six-yard touchdown run with 2:20
remaining in the first half - on
just his second rush of the day.
At halftime, Michigan had
just four first downs and 119 total
yards to Alabama's 12 first downs
and 280 total yards.
Michigan finally gashed the
Crimson Tide defense - which
allowed an average of 8.2 points
per game last season - in the
third quarter, exactly doubling its
first-half offensive output in that
quarter alone (119 yards of total
offense, seven points scored).
After a 51-yard Alabama field
goal pushed the lead to 34-7, Rob-
inson found junior wide receiver
Devin Gardner - a converted
quarterback - open in the left flat
for a 44-yard touchdown, the first
score of Gardner's career.
Then, on an evening that went
as poorly as expected for Michi-
gan, it got even worse.
The air left the building for a
few minutes late in the third quar-
ter, when Robinson lay writhing
on the ground with an apparent
back or hip injury after diving
just short of a first down. He was
taken to the tunnel but returned
for the next series.
It was an uncharacteristic
game for Robinson. After rush-
ing just twice for three yards in
the first half, Robinson ended up
scampering 10 times in the game
for 27 yards, while going 11-for-26
passing with 200 yards, a touch-
down and two interceptions.
Alabama closed the scoring
midway through the fourth quar-
ter with a two-yard touchdown
run by running back T.J. Yeldon,
pushing a blowout even further
out of reach.

Michigan sweeps Delaware, No. 22 Maine

Because
the senior captain, who tallied
her first collegiate goal on Sun-
day afternoon, has a little wager
going with the rest of'the team.
"A goal a game would be nice,"
Morris reflected. "If I get 12
goals, my (jersey) number, (my
teammates) will take me to Frito
Batidos. (It's) a lot to look for-
ward to."
Michigan capped off the
weekend more optimistic about'
its season than when it started.
The Wolverines countered their
first pair of losses of the season
with two wins in their first home
stand - against Delaware on Sat-
urday and then against the 22nd-
ranked Black Bears the following
afternoon.
Freshman forward Shannon
Scavelli scored the Wolverines'
first goal at the 14-minute mark
on Sunday, redirecting a penal-
ty-corner from junior Rachael
Mack.
According to Michigan coach
Marcia Pankratz, that first goal
was important for orienting the
rest of the team.
"With a young group, you're
trying to keep them in a positive
frame of mind," Pankratz said. "I
think we kept (Maine) on their
heels, which was one of the talk-
ing points of pregame."
It didn't take much longer for

the Wolverines to cap off their
scoring against Maine. Five min-
utes later, junior Michelle Rob-
erts dragged Maine's goalie and
defenders left, and then found
Morris in the circle. Morris dove
forward to finish the play and
tip the ball past the Black Bears'
goalie.
Though Morris maintains that
the team got a little "flat-footed"
in the last 10 minutes ofthe game,
it wasn't too visible. Though the
match remained scoreless and
Michigan stayed on the defensive
end, the Wolverine offense main-

tained possession, marking four
penalty corners and six addition-
al shots on goal.
But Morris's goal still
remained the highlight of the
match. She doesn't usually play
at forward - generally sticking
to midfield- but finding the back
of the net was nothing more than
instinct. And for Pankratz, it was
just the kind of thing she likes to
see from her captains.
"I didn't think she was going
to reach (the ball), but it was,
pretty cool for her first goal to be
such an outstanding one. I hope

to see more for her. She is ver-
satile, hard working and doing a
great job leading our team. I'm
happy for her."
The Wolverines were coming
off a high from the day before,
when redshirt sophomore Leslie
Smith netted her first career hat
trick.
And since the Wolverine's
game plan worked so well against
the Blue Hens, they didn'tchange
much when they took on the
Black Bears 24 hours later.
At this early point in the sea-
son, the focus isn't so much on

Michigan's opponents as it is
intrinsic issues.
"Each team, you have to come
up with a different game plan
(but) before the game today, we
talked about our game plan, just
keep the pace high, the level high
(and) do what we've been doing
in practice," Scavelli said.
After Sunday's victory, Pan-
kratz couldn't stop gushing when
thinking about her players.
"The synergy of the team is
important and we've got a great
group of women," Pankratz said.
"It's been fun to coach them."

coach Greg Ryan had noth-

"Haley's been a rock for us,
and tonight was no different,"
Ryan said. "She really kept us in

Kopmeyer's performance,
plus a strong effort from the
Wolverine back line, couldn't
contain the 49ers. In the 87th
minute, Nadia Link buried a
penalty kick for Long Beach
State. Just three minutes later,
in the final moments of the

Sunday afternoon at the Michi-
gan Soccer Stadium, senior
defensemen Brian Klemczak
and Kofi Opare anchored a
mostly-solid defensive effort by
the Wolverines.
In the first half, they con-
trolled the center of the field and
did a good job maintaining pos-
session.
But the Vikings had more
chances offensively than Michi-
gan, in part because of the Wol-
verines were unable to possess
the ball on offense.
"We were poor defensively all
around," Michigan coach Chaka
Daley said. "We were poor in
the first half defensively, we
were just fortunate. We tried to
acknowledge that at halftime
and tidy some things up, but
it just went from bad to worse
unfortunately."
But the defensive effort
wasn't enough to get the offense
going in the first half.
Though Michigan dominated
the time of possession in the
first half, the Wolverines tallied
just seven shots compared to the
Vikings' six.

"If you're playing through

Long Beach State took 11
shots in the first half, but it was
the Wolverines who scored the
game's first goal. In the 35th
minute, junior forward Shelby
Chambers-Garcia capitalized on
a mistake by the 49ers' defense.
She gained possession of the
ball in Long Beach State's pen-
alty area, and cooly buried a shot
from 12 yards out for her third
goal of the season.
That lead would last until the
87th minute, when the 49ers'
heroics silenced Michigan's
upset bid.
After the Wolverines scored

late in the first half, they relied
heavily on their defense to pre-
serve the lead, taking only one
shot in the second 45 minutes.
Though the 49ers controlled the
tempo and the ball for most of

but only four reached the Wol-
verines' netminder.
The loss capped a disap-

The Wolverines began the
season 4-0-0, their best start
since 2002, but have now
dropped two straight.
"Soccer can be a cruel sport,"
Ryan said. "I think this game
will make us a lot stronger and a
lot tougher."

Michigan almost saw the

but the Wolverines tied the game
at seven.
Both Michigan and the Razor-
backs traded points until an
Erwin kill and an attack error by
Arkansas to take the set.

the season continued on Satur-
day, recording-

a whole six-
rotation skill
set," Rosen
said of Erwin. "We brought her
off the floor and I thought our
team didn't play as well. I think
she's kind of the glue that holds
us together."
The Wolverines also took on
a UMBC team for the first time
in program history on Satur-
day afternoon, and will gladly
welcome the Raiders back, after
winning 25-9, 25-16, 26-24.
Tied at two in the first set,
Michigan raced out on a 5-0 run,
highlighted by two back row
kills from freshman outside hit-

ter Kelly Murphy. Both teams
traded points before the Wol-
verines put together a quick 4-0
run capped by freshman middle
blocker Krystalyn Goode's block
and kill.
Michigan ultimately ended on
a 10-0 run, though, after a Cross
block. Cross, who played for the
Canadian national team over the
summer, recorded seven kills
and five blocks in the game.
"I feel a lot more prepared for
the season - mentally and physi-
cally," Cross said of her time
playing for Canada. "I learned a
lot from being around such high-
caliber players over the sum-
mer."
Michigan cruised through the
second game as well, continuing
to rotate freshmen through the
lineup.
"We're trying to find out what
our best combinations are right
now," Rosen said.
"It doesn't have to do with
classes right now, we're tryingto
figure out what our best lineup
is and at this point in the season
we're very much figuring that
out."
Down 2-0, the Wolverines
went on an 8-0 run to reclaim
the lead.
The teams would go back-and-
forth until the Wolverines pulled
away on a 4-0 lead to make the
score 22-13. Michigan capital-
ized on an attack error to claim
the set.

SUSTAINABIiTY
Make the 'U'
econ omy dliverse

Remember , those ques-
tionnaires we filled out
during freshman orien-
tation? Each
year, the
University's
Division
of Student
Affairs com-
piles the data
from those
forms'and
publishes MATTHEW
the results GREEN
online.
Perusing the
report is fascinating, to say the
least. In 'addition to offering a
standard demographic profile of
each graduating class, the report
includes findings on students'
political views, future plans and
even self-image. Apparently,
76.9 percent of University stu-
dents responded in 2009 that
it was essential or very impor-
tant to them to be "very well off
financially." This is a completely
understandable desire, of course,
particularly for incoming fresh-
men accustomed to the comforts
and luxuries their parents had
lavished on them up until that
point.
But exactly how comfortable
and pampered are these stu-
dents? The questionnaire data
hints at an answer.
For the class of 2013 (the most
recent class for which data is
published), 84.4 percent of stu-
dents reported parental income
above $50,000 a year. More stu-
dents reported an annual family
income of over $250,000 (16.9
percent) than below $50,000
(15.6 percent). Keep in mind
that according to the 2010 U.S.
Census, more than half of all
Michigan residents make less
than $50,000 each year. Given
their relative affluence, it's no
wonder that such a high percent-
age of University students would

expect a modicum of economic
success.
Intriguingly, about 50 percent
of students reported that their
fathers were doctors, lawyers,
engineers, executives or busi-
ness owners. And more than 75
percent of their parents went
to college, compared to the 27.5
percent of American adults who
did according to The Chronicle
of Higher Education in January
2011.
Reading this, you're probably
unsurprised. Affluent parents
have long sent their children
to the best schools their money
could buy. It's hardly newswor-
thy that an elite school would
cater to a moneyed clientele.
Mere mention of Harvard and
Yale conjures images of wealth
and status as much as it does aca-
demic prestige.
But Harvard ad Yale, as
well as other prestigious insti-
tutions, have begun to address
their historic social exclusiv-
ity. According to Harvard's
office of financial aid, "families
with incomes currently below
$60,000 are not expected to con-
tribute to college costs." Period.
Yale and Princeton, in addition
to Harvard, recently re-exam-
ined their early-admission pro-
cesses to ensure that the process
didn't unfairly favor well-heeled
applicants.
These actions may not have
solved the problem of wealth
inequality on college campuses,
but they've at least started an
administrative dialogue about
making higher education more
socially equitable. Against a
backdrop of continually ris-
ing income inequality, perhaps
it's time for the University to
seriously address the dispar-
ity between the rich and poor
as reflected by its student body.

President Barack Obama address a crowd of 4,000 at Al Glick Field House on Friday. University officials and campus leaders wave as President Barack Obama takes the stage.
Obama advocates for financial aid

4,000 pack Al Glick
Field House on
Friday
By BETHANY BIRON and
JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
ManagingNews Editor and
Editor mo Chief-
Speaking before a bleary-
eyed capacity crowd of 4,000
who waited in the wee hours of
the morning Friday to secure
a prime spot, President Barack
Obama stressed the importance
of higher education by announc-
ing a handful of new proposals to
combat student debt.
During his address at Al
Glick Field Htuse, the Michigan
football team's indoor practice
facility, Obama unveiled a plan
that would allocate $10 billion
in fe'deral aid each year to col-
leges and universities that limit
tuition increases. Ann Arbor was
Obama's last stop on a three-day,
five-state, trip following his State
of the Union address on Tuesday."
"We are putting colleges on
notice you can't keep - you
can't assume that you'll just jack

up tuition every single year,"
Obama said. "If you can't stop
tuition from going up, then the
funding you get from taxpayers
each year will go down."
Obama also proposed a $1 bil-
lion Race to the Top program
that chould award funding to
states that make an effort to con-
tinue to fund higher education
and limit tuition hikes.
"We're telling the states, if
you can find new ways to bring
down the cost of college and
make it easier for more students
to graduate, we'll help you do it,"
Obama said. "We will give you
additional federal support if you
are doing a good job of making
sure that all of you aren't loaded
up with debt when you graduate
from college."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan said
the administration is working to
make more resources available
to students. The president's stu-
dent aid reforms would mostly
increase the amount of need-
based Perkins Loans available to
low-income students.
"We can't do it by ourselves,"
Duncan said. "So we're going to

try to put out a$1billiontaxincen-
tive to states and to colleges to do
the right thing. We're challenging
states to continue to invest even in
tough times and we're challeng-
ing universities to do two things
- keep tuition rates down and
increase graduation rates."
Obama put pressure on Con-
gress to make the American
Opportunity Tax Credit - which
provides college students with up
to $10,000 over four years - per-
manent, and to double the number
of federal work study jobs avail-
able to students.
The Obama administration
will also boost its efforts to make
financial. aid information more
accessible for families by creating
several online tools that provide
comprehensive information about
what types of aid institutions
offer.
"From now on, parents and
students deserve to know how
a college is doing - how afford-
able is it, how well are its students
doing," Obama said. "We want you
to know how well a car stacks up
before you buy it. You should know
how well a college stacks up."
Speaking under an array of
Big Ten championship banners

and atop a platform placed upon
a block 'M' on the indoor field,
Obama also congratulated the
football team on its Sugar Bowl
win, calling the team "a force to
be reckoned with" under junior
quarterback Denard Robinson,
who was sitting among congress-
men and state officials during
the speech.
In an interview with The
Michigan . Daily before the
speech, Robinson said he was
impressed with the amount of
student support.
"It's great to see President
Obama, I couldn't miss it," Robin-
son said. "A lot of people came out
and came to support him."'
After the speech, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
lauded Obama's attention to the
need for the federal government
to collaborate with universities
around the nation in an effort
to develop efficient policies
that minimize student debt and

increase accessibility.
"College affordability is
extraordinarily important for all
of us and I was so pleased that he
recognizes the complexity - the
fact that the state has a role, the
federal government has a role,
universities have a role - and
all of them have to be working
together to make this possible,"
Coleman said.
Coleman stressed the need for
the state to continue to invest in
higher education, particularly
following years of repeated cuts
in funding alocation to public
colleges within the state, includ-
ing a 15-percent reduction in
funding in 2011 under Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder.
"One of the things that
(Obama) did point out very
clearly was the dramatic disin-
vestment that the states have
made, and one of the most harsh
has been in Michigan," Coleman
said. "We have suffered from

that, and we've done a good job
of cutting costs, we've continued
to try to cut costs but we have
to have a reinvestment by the
state."
Coleman added that achiev-
ing the goal of effectively work-
ing among universities, state
governments and the federal
government to increase college
affordability is going to be chal-
lenging, but an endeavor she is
optimistic about for the future.
"I think universities should be
challenged to find more efficient
ways to save money, and we've
been doing that aggressively at
Michigan for the past 10 years
and I have no problem finding
ways," Coleman said "... And
we're unwilling to lower quality,
because I think what the presi-
dent said that is important, is that
we have the best higher educa-
tion system in the world. And we
do not want to lose that, quality
matters.

Regents approve,
tuition increase

FROM TH D-IAI Y APRIL 15, 2012
Enact tuition equality
s the cost of obtaining a college degree increases each year, higher
education becomes a less realistic goal for those from lower income
families or families hesitant to accumulate debt. As a result, diversity
at the University continues to exist increasingly only in rhetoric. While many
steps must be taken to attract and retain students from all walks of life, the
University is currently examining whether to charge in-state tuition rates to
undocumented immigrants residing in Michigan. Charging the out-of-state
tuition for undocumented Michigan public school graduates hinders students
who worked hard to be accepted to the University. The University's Board
of Regents should make this issue a priority and enforce tuition equality to
increase student diversity and maintain focus on education, not politics.

In-state students.
with 4.9-percent
increase, out-of-
state 6.7-percent
By BETHANY BIRON
ManagingNews Editor
JUNE 21, 2012 - The Univer-
sity's Board of Regents voted 5-3
on Thursday to increase tuition
rates by 2.8-percent for in-state
students and 3.5 percent for out-
of-state students for the 2012-
2013 academic year.
The rates will amount to a
hike of $360 for in-state stu-
dents and $1,340 for out-of-state
students and will be paired with
a 10.1-percent increase in avail-
able financial aid for need-based
undergraduate students, total-
ing $144.8 million.
Duringthe meeting, Universi-
ty President Mary Sue Coleman
said the increase in financial aid
will help offset the tuition hike
for students in need.
"For four straight years now,
we have presented a financial
aid budget that covers the full
increase in tuition for our needi-
est students," Coleman said.
"This year's increase in finan-
cial aid will come in the form of
grants, not loans, which helps
reduce (the) student debt bur-
den."
In a press meeting before
the regents meeting, University
Provost Philip Hanlon called
financial aid "the highest priori-
ty in this budget" and expressed
the University's efforts to help
students in need and main-
tain the University experience.
This is the seventh of the past
eight years that financial aid for
undergraduates will increase by

at least 10 percent.
The approved fiscal year 2013
tuition increase is less than that
of fiscal year 2012, in which out-
of-state students experienced
a 6.7-percent increase, and in-
state students accrued a 4.9-per-
cent increase, amounting to
$1,781 and $797 respectively.
Tuition rates will also
increase by 3.6 percent at the
University's Flint campus and
3.7 percent at the University's
Dearborn campus. Additionally,
room'and board rates at the Ann
Arbor campus will increase by 3
percent, totaling $284 for fiscal
year 2013. Two percent of the
increase will be allocated for
ongoing residence hall renova-
tions.
The state appropriation will
be about $273.1 million, increas-
ing 1.6 percent from last year,
and is part of Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder's projected bud-
get that calls for a 3.1-percent
increase in higher education
funding. This follows the fiscal
year 2012 budget, in which the
state's 15 public universities saw
a 15-percent decrease in fund-
ing.
During the press conference,
Hanlon said while the Univer-
sity appreciates its relationship
with the state, the administra-
tion will continue to urge the
government to expand its efforts
to aid state universities that
have suffered repeated cuts over
the course of the last decade.
"We value our long part-
nership with the state, and we
appreciate very much that the
state is increasing its invest-
ment in higher education,"
Hanlon said. "In real terms, the
state appropriations for the Ann
Arbor campus has dropped $178
million over the past 11 years,
and so we urge the state to con-

tinue to make higher education
a priority."
Regents Denise hitch (D-
Binghain Farms), Laurence
Dietch (D-Bingham Farms)
and Andrea Fischer Newman
(R-Ann Arbor) voted against
the tuition increases, express-
ing frustration with the growing
rates and providing suggestions
for other methods of cutting
costs.
. "I think we need a new model,
and I think there are ways to do
it," Newman said in an inter-
view after the meeting. "I think
there are ways to raise revenue."
During the meeting, Ilitch
called the trend of increasing
tuition at the University and
around the nation "unaccept-
able," noting that upwards of
60 percent of the state's college
graduates carry substantial
debt.
"There's one thing that
remains consistent, and that is
that tuition continues to sky-
rocket and the burden on our
students continues to increase,"
Ilitch said.
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) echoed Ilitch's senti-
ment about the strains of rising
tuition costs for families, though
she added she was "very pleased
and very impressed" with the
administration's. effort to assist
students through increased
financial aid.
Darlow said vast improve-
ments have been made to aid
students from middle- and low-
income homes, and the average
middle-income student now
pays less than they did in 2004.
In setting the University's
budget, Hanlon noted three
primary goals: maintaining and
expanding the University's aca-
demic- strength and excellence,

At the request of Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor), Provost Philip Hanlon is assembling areport
on tuition equality for undocumented students for
the board's consideration. Members of the Coalition
for Tuition Equality, a student-led alliance aiming
to bringstudents and student organizations togeth-
er in support of tuition equality, have spoken at the
regents' monthly meetings about the circumstances
undocumented students face at the University. The
group hopes the University will change its policy
and, allow undocumented immigrants who have
graduated from Michigan high schools to pay in-
state tuition.
The University should enact this change to open
doors for a more racially and socio-economically
diverse student body. The University prides itself
on its diversity - experience with diversity is raised
as early the admissions application - but as dem-
onstrated by recent incoming freshman classes, the
University can be doing much more, especially in
terms of socio-economic diversity. Recent reports
have shown that 79 percent of college enrolled stu-
dents are in the highest income bracket, but only 34
percent are in the lowest. Lowering tuition would
allow for more high-achieving undocumented immi-
grants to enroll in the University, and increase rep-

resentation for a large but often ignored sector of the
population.
Since CTE's founding this year by Public Policy
junior Kevin Mersol-Barg and LSA freshman Dan-
iel Morales, the organization has made impressive
progress, as evidence by Hanlon's upcoming report.
CTE has successfully brought a wide array of stu-
dent organizations into the conversation on tuition
equality. It's apparent there is campus support for
a policy change, and it's not difficult to understand
why. Many undocumented immigrants came to the
U.S. by no fault of their own and face daily difficul-
ties due to their immigration status. Barring those
students from a more affordable education increases
theirhardship.Other Michiganuniversities, includ-
ing Western Michigan University and Wayne State
University, have policies that allow undocumented
immigrants to pay in-state rates. The University is
in a clear position to be an advocate for education.
Congress hasn't passed the Development, Relief
and Education for Alien Minors Act, which would
grant citizenship toundocumented minors after liv-
ing in the country for five years, since its introduc-
tion in 2001. Because of this lack of federal action,
the University is obligated to support education and
student diversity by enacting tuition equality.

Group organizes
at regents meeting
advocating for new
policy
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
FEB. 17, 2012 - When LSA
freshman Daniel Morales was
first admitted to the University; he
deferred the start of his freshman
year because his family couldn't
afford the out-of-state tuition rate
without financial aid.
At the time, Morales was an
undocumented resident.
Due to his lack of citizenship,
Morales, who attended high school
in Michigan, was not offered in-
state tuition or financial aid.Yester-
day, Morales told the University's
Board of Regents his story at its
monthly meeting, advocating for
a policy change that would allow
undocumented Michigan residents
to pay in-state tuition.
Currently, undocumented
students must pay out-of-state
tuition and are not eligible for
financial aid.
This year, the cost difference
between the in-state and out-
of-state rate for a full-time LSA
freshman is about $25,000.
"For the first time in my life, I
came close to giving up," Morales
said. "But students like myself,
the thousands of us who graduate
from Michigan high schools every
year with the hopes of bettering
our communities and lives, do not
simply give up. Iwas an American
at heart and more definitely, I was
a wolverine."
Morales addressed the board
during the public'comments sec-
tion of the meeting and spoke
about his struggle to attend the
University.
"I come here today to proudly
tell you my story because it rep-
resents the absolute complex-
ity of this issue," Morales said
at the meeting. "I am here today
because we would like to work

with you to remedy this injustice,
alleviate inequal access to higher
education for undocumented stu-
dents and to invest in a rich and
truly diverse experience for all
Michigan students."
Morales spoke on behalf of the
Coalition for Tuition Equality, a
student organization founded by
Public Policy junior Kevin Mer-
sol-Barg when he started his term
last fall as an LSA representative
in Central Student Government.
Mersol-Barg, who is running
for CSG president, said he hopes
the regents will collaborate with
the coalition.
"I'm hoping that they recip-
rocate our offer to work with
them, that they would too want to
work with us," Mersol-Barg said.
"When Daniel spoke they looked
very receptive."
Morales echoed Mersol-Barg's
sentiments, and said in an inter-
view after the meeting he'hopes
the University will work with the
organization to increase college
accessibility and affordability for
all students.
"My biggest hope is that they
will work with our coalition to
craft a new policy which is more
inclusive to all students from the
state of Michigan, and that we can
regain our status as a progressive
and fair school that gives any stu-
dent who is deserving of that edu-
cation a great education."
Mersol-Barg said he formed
the coalition, which is comprised
of representatives from various
student groups, because he saw an
injustice and wanted to fix it. He
said the number of undocumented
students at the University is not
possible to determine but is likely
very small; which could be due to
their difficulties affording tuition.
"This is a pressing issue for stu-
dents not only here at the Univer-
sity but even more students that
are very talented and bright and
can't be here," Mersol-Barg said.
After the speech, Morales said
though he was nervous before
he spoke, the nerves faded as he
began talking and he received
positive feedback from the

regents and people in attendance
at the meeting.
"Once I was up there, and once
I began to speak, I was kind of
amazed at the positive receptive-
ness of the entire board of regents
as a whole," Morales said. "I felt
they were very receptive to the
overall message once I was fin-
ished delivering the speech."
In his speech, Morales said
during the year he deferred
his enrollment, he sought and
received residency, which quali-
fied him to pay the in-state rate:
"As soon as I mentioned how
my acceptance to the University
of Michigan-Ann Arbor was rid-
ing on this, the ICE agent's eyes.
shot up from his desk, and he
smiled; he was a Michigan Wol-
verine," Morales said.
At the end of Morales's speech
when he mentioned the different
student organizations that con-
tribute to the coalition, members
stood up around the roomholding
signs naming their representative
groups - including Central Stu-
dent Government, American Civil
Liberties Union-Undergraduate
Chapter, Latino Students Orga-
nization and Muslim Students'
Association - then walked out
of the Regents' Room on the first
floor of the Fleming Administra-
tion Building.
Though the timer went off that
indicated Morales's five-minutes
of allotted speaking time was up,
the room remained silent, and he
quickly finished the last few sen-
tences of his speech.
Upon commencing his speech,
regents Laurence Deitch (D-
Bingham Farms) and Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor)
commended him and the mem-
bers of the coalition for attending
the meeting.
Morales said he was encour-
aged to speak at the regents meet-
ing by E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student affairs, at a
town hall meeting on Feb.8.
"I went directly to the source
because I thought that was the
way that change can come about,"
Morales said.

Big House wedding bells
This summer, the Athletic
Department announced the pos-
ibility of holding private events
n many of the athletic spaces
an campus. The most exciting of
hese locations is the football field,
where just weeks ago, the Wol-
rerines stole a victory from Notre
Dame in the final seconds of the
J 'versity's firstnightgame.
,It's more than just weddings

Director David Brandon. "It'sreal-
y taking these wonderful spaces

ised, and trying to put them to
work in such a way that people can

Brandon played a crucial role in
he Athletic Department's recent
lecision to open the Big House
ind other athletic venues for pri-
rate events.
"There are a lot of people
who graduate from here who
ove this place and have an emo-
ional connection to it," Brandon
aid. "These spaces will often be
ppealing to people and give them
chance to connect with the Uni-

versity."
Although this option just
became a possibility.in late June,
there have already been several
bookings.
"Everyone that has had any-
thing in (the Big House) walks
away raving," said Katy Hepner,
special events coordinator for the
Athletic Department. "It exceeds
all expectation. And whenyouhave
the historicaltraditionofMichigan
football in the backdrop, we're set-
ting ourselves up for success."
Surrounded by 109,901 empty
bleacher seats and the memories
of cheering fans, the betrothed
can- exchange vows on the field
surrounded by bridesmaids,
groomsmen and their guests. On a
very hot and sunny July 7, the Big
House's first wedding took place
between Craig Koss and Betsy
Barrett-Koss on the so-yard line.
For a wedding in the Big House,
couples pay anywhere from $6,000
for an hour-long ceremony on the
field to a $9,000 rental fee for the
Jack Roth Stadium Club, a venue
meant to offer refreshments, pre-
mium seating and deluxe cuisine
for guests during football games.
Since the Athletic Depart-
ment's announcement, several
groups have booked events and
photo opportunities on the field
andatthe StadiumClub.Withfour
events in October, this opportu-
nity is quickly gaining popularity,
as Michigan Stadium hasa packed
schedule in the upcoming summer
months.
"Our winter months are a lit-
tle slower, but in June, July and
August, we're pretty busy with
weddings and some other corpo-
rate conference dinners," Hepner
said.
Ana Skidmore, the principle
event planner of TwoFoot Cre-
ative, an event planning company
in the Ann Arbor area, recently
booked her first wedding recep-
tion at the Stadium Club for next
year.
"Weddings in the Big House are
obviously for people who love the
UniversityofMichigan,"Skidmore
said. "The clients I have booked
for next year don't want to go
crazy over Michigan, but because
they're in the Stadium Club, there
will be a giant block 'M' staring at
everyone from the stadium. Obvi-
ously, they want Michigan to be a
part of the wedding, but not all of

the wedding."
From a planner's perspective,
Skidmore said there's a fine line
that's easy to cross when planning
themed weddings.
"You need to be careful not to go
overboard, because then it becomes
cheesy and it becomes a celebration
of Michigan and not the fact that
they're getting married."
But Skidmore also noted that
it's very easy to plan a themed
wedding with class. She suggested
warm mahogany seating and gold
or copper linensto subtly and tact-
fully tie in maize and blue to the
occasion.
When Skidmore was plan-
ning her own wedding in 2007,
she tried to get married in the Big
House. Her husband, a recruiter
for the football team at the time,
spoke to the department, but it
wasn't an option.
"We did get on the field for pic-
tures ... but that was the closest we
could get," Skidmore said. "I think
what they're trying to do now,
bringing the Michigan experience
to people who might never have
had it before, is really cool because
you might never get to be ina suite
or on the field at the Big House
unless you're invited to a wedding."
Something maize, something
blue
Many University alums have
approached Skidmore with the
desire to incorporate Michigan
into their ceremony, even if they're
not in the Big House.
"A lot of people use 'The Victors'
as their grand entrance, or instead

Ley said.
Best proposed to Ley last Janu-
ary at the State Theater, where
they went on their first date the
year before.
"The problem was that the State
only shows two movies at a time,"
Best said. "We went to see 'Black
Swan' because the alternative
was 'Blue Valentine' ... which ends
in divorce. So even though it's a
depressing movie we still went,
and I proposed afterwards."
After Ley said "yes" and the
wedding planning began, it wasn't
long before they picked a venue.
The couple is getting married in
the Pendleton Room of the Michi-
gan Union and will host the recep-
tion in the Union's Ballroom. Ley
recognized that a big advantage of
a historical location like the Union
is the level of school spirit already
associated with it.
"Having it in the Union will
automatically make our wedding
kind of themed because of its loca-
tion - we won't need tacky things
like blue and yellow balloons to
incorporate Michigan," Ley said.
According to Ley, almost every-
thing in the wedding and reception
will be white, but the 200 guests
will still see a few hints of maize
and blue from the University.
The couple has tastefully
slipped maize and blue into dis-
tinct components of the day. At
the reception, The Victors will be
played, there will be a maize and
blue ball pit in the kids' area, and
a specialty maize and blue cock-

Sanjay Gupta addresses graduating class of 2012.
Saiijay Gupta offers life
lessons at theb Big House

By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
The doctor

Michigan has to
offer
APRIL 28, 2012 - Over the
weekend, 11,574 graduates
received their tickets to leave Ann
Arbor, to stop checking CTools
and to never turn in another blue
book exam.
In the Big House, blanketed
with overcast skies, the Univer-
sity graduates sat for about two
hours to hear speakers, including
Universitv alum Saniav Guant

and receive the official recogni-
tion of their degrees.
Gupta, who is the chief medi-
cal correspondent for CNN and a
practicing neurosurgeon, started
his speech with his long-felt per-
sonal attachment to Ann Arbor,
beginning with his parents meet-
ing in the city and leading to his
eventual attendance at the Uni-
versity. for undergraduate and
medical school.
"Not only was the foundation
for most of my life conceived in
this town, I myself was likely con-
ceived in this town," Gupta said.
"Best bet is the 17th floor of the
University Towers - but no one's
talking for sure."
Gupta then delved into 10 more
serious lessons for the graduates
while he stood on the podium.

"Lesson number one: always
respect your elders," Gupta
began. "There's no doubt that our
parents seem to grow smarter
as we grow older, but truth is
they also sacrificed an incredible
amount to allow our lives be what
they are, and it is on their shoul-
ders that we realize our greatest
triumphs."
Other lessons included advice
to make the impossible possible
and to always cheer for the Wol-
verines.
"If you ever cheer for another
team in competition with the
Wolverines, then some 500,000
alumni will hunt you down and
paint you maize and blue," Gupta
said.
He also said the graduates
should drink a beer at Ashley's,
which was met with applause
from listeners and prompted
Gupta to offer to buy drinks for
anyone he saw out on the night of
commencement - and the cheers
continued.
Gupta told anecdotes about
his children and his experiences
reporting abroad that have put
his life at risk.
He spoke about a time when he
was in a war zone in Afghanistan
and his camp was being invad-
ed by enemy soldiers. He was
instructed to write a letter to his
loved ones in case of his death.
He suggested the graduates think
about what they would write in
such a situation.
"I don't know what you'd
write, and maybe you've never
thought two seconds about it,
but lesson number five graduates,

make sure you can write this sen-
tence: 'I am who I always wanted
to be,"' he said.
As the speakers in the stadium
were still echoing Gupta's final
words, the crowd erupted with a
"Go Blue" chant. University Pres-
ident Mary Sue Coleman paused
to laugh before continuing with
the ceremony.
During apress conference after
the speech, where Gupta donned
a navy blazer and maize socks, he
said Coleman asked him to be the
commencement speaker at a foot-
ball game.
"It was a tremendous honor,"
he said. "I think it was particu-
larly exhilarating just being in the
Big House when I was asked to do
it because this place has profound
memories for me."
After the ceremony, Gupta
also said that while the current
economy is challenging, he feels
the graduates have an advantage
when it comes to finding jobs with
their degrees from the University.
"I think Michigan gradu-
ates are pretty uniquely pre-
pared in our collective society,"
Gupta said. "It's tough (with) the
economy, but I think Michigan
grads probably have a leg up just
because of the education they
have and also the resources in
terms of the alumni."
Gupta explained during his
speech the ways he defines the
Michigan tradition, telling the
graduates to never forget what
the tradition means as they go
forth in their lives.

enously affluent as ours?
The University can foster
more economic diversity in a
variety of ways. Most obviously,
the administration could think
twice the next time a tuition
increase is on the table. Accord-
ing to a May 2011 poll by the
Pew Research Center where a
nationally representative sample
of 2,142 adults'ages 18 and older
were surveyed, 48 percent of 18
to 34 year olds who hadn't gone
to college said they didn't go
because they couldn't afford it.
Financial aid is also part of the
solution. Perhaps the University
should follow Harvard's lead,
offering more sweeping finan-
cial aid packages to low-income
students. That'd be expensive,
sure. But at $6.5 billion, the Uni-
versity of Michigan's endow-
ment is greater than the GNP of,
Nicaragua. I think we can afford
it.
To its credit, the University
already takes into consideration
the economic background of

teaching, morethan25percent
of them were previously involved
in sustainability projects.
However, during the talk
about sustainability efforts,
Coleman told the audience why
the University decided not to
sign the American College and
University Presidents' Climate
Commitment - an agreement
between U.S. colleges to elimi-
nate greenhouse gas emissions
on campuses nationwide.
"After seeking expert counsel,
we have concluded we cannot set
a date by which we will achieve
carbon neutrality," Coleman said
in her speech. "There is simply
no viable way forward at this
time to achieve such a feat, and
I will not place an undue burden
on the backs of future presidents
of this great institution."
Engineering graduate student
Ryan Smith, who attended the
event yesterday, was involved
with the University's Student
Sustainability Initiative and the
CSIA. In 2009, the Student Sus-
tainability Initiative collected
information about which sus-
tainability issues the student
body cared about and relayed it
to the administration. The CSIA
then began, and Smith worked
on the energy use team of the
assessment.
"Through this whole pro-
cess (the administration) really
depended on all the data that was
generated by the students and
the integrated assessment pro-
cess," Smith said. "I'm proud of
them for just putting all that on
the table, saying, 'OK, we care
about this. Let's really get some

applicants each fall. It awards
points to students if they're
from an economically depressed
region or if they attended an
underprivileged high school. But
as progressive and important as
these considerationsamay be, they
clearly aren't doing enough. The
University must do a better job
of reaching out to disadvantaged
high school students before the
application process even begins.
As the Occupy Wall Street
movement decries the unequal
influence of the wealthiest few,
it's worth calling attention to the
channels through which they
attained their power and for-
tune. Many of them surely fun-
neled through the nation's most
elite colleges. In the parlance of
OWS, the University needs to
take a firmer stance in support of
educating the 99 percent.
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to make a decent liv-
ing, as the data shows that many
University students do. It's part
of the American dream, after
all, and young people across the
socioeconomic spectrum likely
share this aspiration. It's the
University's responsibility to
ensure that this goal can be met
by the genuine Leaders and Best
- not just the already wealthy
and well connected.

real good data."'
Smith said his only concern is
that some students will wantbig-
ger and faster changes.
"I know the student body
tends to be very zealous and very
energetic about issues," he said.
"They always want to push it
further. Really based on the all
the data that was presented to
us, (the Uniersity has) the most
reasonable, and quite honestly,
ambitious step forward."
To help encourage student
involvement in the sustain-
ability efforts, the University's
Planet Blue Student Ambassador
Program recently started hav-
ing student and faculty advi-
sors. The ambassador program
involves selected students who
live in residence halls and make
others in the community more
environmentally conscious
through a variety of programs.
"I think this Planet Blue
ambassadors program has great
promise," Coleman said. "The
best thing possible would be to
accelerate the pace of change so
that we really begin to see more
and more people taking personal
responsibility. So I'm very hope-
ful."
During the announcement
the lights were turned off in the
Gallery Room when someone in
the audience pointed out that
there was sufficient lighting
from outside and the lights were
unnecessary - a reminder that
the little changes will make a
difference.
"Students are the story of
environmental awareness and
sustainability at Michigan,"
Coleman said. "They exemplify
our belief that a great public
university continually strives to
make the world a better place."

operating efficiently and ensur-
ing college affordability and
accessibility.
As part of the budget, faculty
will receive a 3-percent salary
increase, and staff will receive
a 2-percent salary, increase as
part of the budget, which Han-
lon said is essential to securing
the strength of the University.
"Academic excellence begins
with human resources. Univer-
sities are excellent because of
their people," Hanlon said. "To
maintain academic excellence,
we need the most outstanding
students, faculty and staff at
this university."
According to Hanlon, por-
tions of the general funds will
also be allocated to maintain-
ing the University's library
system, developing educational
program and investing in new-
technology. Funds will also
be used to better consolidate
IT programs on campus that
he said have historically been
"disaggregated" with too many'
units.
To decrease budget cuts and
tuition increases, the Univer-
sity has continued to engage in
a long-term commitment to cost
containment policies, spear-
headed by Coleman in 2004.
Since the onset of the program,

the University has reduced $235
million in general fund expen-
ditures and seeks to save anoth-
er $120 million in the next five
years - $30 million specifically
in the coming fiscal year.
Cost containment efforts
include reducing low-enroll-
ment classes, better consoli-
dation of services and staff,
altering health care and benefit
programs and increasing ener-
gy efficiency in campus build-
ings.
The cost reduction program
has allowed for reallocation of
funds to other efforts like revi-
talizing academic buildings.
Hanlon said the University will
soon embark on a three-year
program that will grant $45
million each year for large-scale
campus renovations, which are
"more cost-effective than doing
piecemeal fix ups."
The administration seeks to
ensure that the quality of life on
campus is not hindered or nega-
tively impacted for students
when determining the budget
and cutting costs, according to
Hanlon.
"We do not want to in anyway
reduce the experience our stu-
dents have, so we're very care-
ful when we do these things to
try to make sure we do them in
a way that will enable an excel-
lent education for our students,"
he said.

GUPTA
From Page 6C
"It's a Michigan tradition to
take risks and, in the process,
blaze new trails," Gupta said. "It's
a Michigan tradition to always
read the directionsbutnot always
to follow them, to always prepare
but sometimes throw that prepa-
ration in the trash allowing your-.
self to be surprised, honest and
genuine. It's a Michigan tradition
to make history and change the
world, to be immortal not as in
living forever but as never being
forgotfen."
Other speakers who addressed
the crowd of about 50,000 before
Gupta's speech included LSA
Associate Dean Philip Deloria,
who spoke in place of LSA Dean
Terrence McDonald who was
unable to attend, Engineering
graduate Julia Brennan and Cole-
man.
In Deloria's remarks, he
explained the word "gump-
tion" to the crowd, saying all of
those graduatinghave it. He said
though having gumption gives
one "guts" and "wits," it is not
the only aspect graduates will
need in life as they move for-
ward.
"Mix one part gumption with
equal parts knowledge, com-
mitment, patience and the will-
ingness to take a risk," Deloria
said. "Stir in a healthy portion
of liberal arts and sciences edu-
cation and you have before you a
recipe for success- a recipe to
become truly one of the leaders
and best."
Brennan, who was the selected
student speaker, asked the stu-
dents to never forget their first
days at the University, which
she said was a shared experience
between all of the graduates.

"Celebrate that unsettled feel-
ing," Brennan said. "Celebrate
Michigan for instilling in us the
confidence to thrive in every-
thing we choose to do."
Coleman was the last to speak
before the granting .of the hon-
orary degrees. She spoke about
creativity and said the graduates
will need to adopt new ways of
thinking to change the future.
"Simply put, we expect you to
raise a few eyebrows," Coleman
said.
Honorarydegreeswereaward-
ed by the University's Board of
Regents to five University alum-
ni, includingGupta, who received
a Doctor of Humane Letters.
J. Ira Harris, a financier,,
received an honorary Doctor
of Laws, and Richard Sarns, a
biomedical engineer and entre-
preneur, received an honorary
Doctor of Engineering. Both
Susan Orlean, author and writer
for The New Yorker magazine,
and Chris Van Allsburg, author
and illustrator of books such as
Jumanji and The Polar Express,
received honorary Doctors of
Humane Letters as well.
Coleman said the group of
honorary degree recipients was
an influential team.
"They embody the power and
reward of creativity," she said.
"They express their ideas and
talents in different reaches and
outlets."
LSA graduate Devon Porter,
who will spend the upcoming
weeks applying for jobs, said the
speeches were inspirational.
"It was avery good ceremony, I
got a lot from it," Porter said. "It's
great because they spoke to the
anxiety that comes with graduat-
ing, especially in this job market,
but they also spoke to that feeling
of 'go after it' and do what you
love doing."

Spectrum Center
celebrates 40 years

LGBT activists
discuss experiences
during anniversary
events on campus
By DANA DEL VECCHIO
and SABIRA KHAN
For theDaily
and Daily Staff Reporter
Nov. 21, 2011 - After work-
ing for the University as an ath-
letic trainer for the football team
from 1968 to 1979, Lindsy McLean
joined the San Francisco 49ers as
a trainer. But for the 24 years that
McLean worked with the team,
he stalled coming out to his-pro-
fessional community to keep his
personal life and career separate.
During a roundtable discussion
on Friday as part of the Spectrum
Center's 40th anniversary events,.
McLean talked about his experi-
ence coming out and the discrifi-
ination he faced from people in
the industry. After being verbally
harassed at work, McLean found
solace at a church that welcomed
the gay community.
"I'd leave Candlestick Park and
go to church," McLean said. "I
think the fact that I had an outlet
there, it really helped me."_
To overcome his difficulties
and serve as a role model for
other gay people, McLean looked
to others for support including
author Betty Berzon and her book
"Setting Them Straight."
"I thought, what do I have to
lose?" he said. "Maybe I could
help a few others in their strug-
gles against hate and lack of
acceptance by coming out."
McLean was recognized by the
sports community in an ESPN
Magazine article in 2004 that
illustrated his efforts to achieve
increased tolerance for LGBT

During another discussion
on Friday celebrating the Spec-
trum Center's mission to promote
awareness of LGBT issues and
tolerance on campus, philanthro-
pist and technology entrepreneur
David Bohnett discussed his
foundation, the David Bohnett
Foundation - a non-profit, grant-
making organization that aims to
improve society+through social
activism.
Bohnett, a University alum,
said the foundation gives more
than $40 million to various
organizations and is centered
on LGBT leadership programs,
diversity initiatives and devel-
opment of CyberCenters, which
allow members of the LGBT com-
munity to network and communi-
cate with each other.
Bohnett said the foundation
focuses on the challenges of
health and happiness, earning a
living, military and public service,
personal safety, legalizing gay
marriage and other equal oppor-
tunities for members of the LGBT
community. To make significant
changes, Bohnett said there must
be large-scale modifications in
culture and public opinion, which
can stem from legislation in fed-
eral policy such as the repeal of
'don't ask, don't tell'
"We have been and we are
becoming a broader, progressive
movement," Bohnett said. "In
my experience ... we take a great
deal of effort to integrate with the
labor movement, the broader pro-
gressive movement."
Bohnett added that he is sup-
portive of the Obama admin-
istration's willingness to enact
non-discrimination policies that
will impact a variety of LGBT
citizens.
"I was just at a meeting in
Washington this week, and
there's a very deliberate, thought-
ful and specific approach to
include sexual orientation with

the federal adherent re
ment," he said. "That mean

DJ teams with Axe
One Night Only to
surprise crowd
By ANDREW ECKHOUS
DailyArts Writer
DEC. 9, 2011 - Girl Talk is
a mad scientist. Splicing Lady
Gaga legs together with Michael
Jackson arms and a Biggie Smalls
head, his creations absorb energy
from the lovestruck crowd and
throw it back, resulting in a rau-
cous frenzy of screaming, singing
and dancing. Attendingone of his
concerts is not only a chance to
see the world's foremost mash-up
artist at work, but also an oppor-
tunity to sing along to songs you
love, songs you hate and songs
you don't even know, with hun-
dreds of people you've never met'
before but for some reason want
to embrace.
Coming to Ann Arbor last
night for the Axe One Night Only
tour, Girl Talk's Gregg Gillis is
currently making the rounds
through college campuses cross-
country playing secret shows at
small venues, making for an inti-
mate and sweaty experience. The
shows were kept under wraps so
well that even Gillis forgot about
them.

"We scheduled these shows
months ago, and there were no
mentions on Twitter or the Inter-
net, so it sort of slipped my mind
too, believe it or not," he said in
an exclusive interview with The
Michigan Daily.
Last night's concert was at the
Blind Pig, a cozy venue (to put it
mildly), and though there was a
remarkable lack of neoh in the
crowd, there was.no shortage of
energy. Gillis admitted the small
Blind Pig couldn't support his.
normal light show, but empha-
sized that he wanted to "bring
the insane energy and atmo-
sphere of a bigger show" to the
legendary bar.
The openers, People Under the
Stairs, primed the crowd, spout-
ing fist-pumping lyrics like, "If
you don't like beer, get the fuck
outta here!" By the time Girl Talk
walked on stage, the rambunc-
tious crowd was ready to get
down.
The pure, unadulterated ener-
gy of Girl Talk never wavered:
He amped up the crowd with his
convulsive dancing, streams of
confetti and his version of back-
up dancers, who sing along while
using leafblowers to blow toilet
paper and water into the soaking
wet, "Is this your sweat or mine?"
crowd. Meanwhile, dozens of
front-row concertgoers were

lucky enough to be brought up
on stage, allowing them to dance
next to Gillis and have their pic-
tures posted on Facebook by jeal-
ous friends.
At a Girl :Talk show, your
favorite Wu-Tang/Souljah Boy/
Outkast verse may be mixed
with your favorite Radiohead/
Metallica/Dr.Dre beats, giving
you a double-dose of mindblow-
ing music. The schvitzy crowd
could be bumpin'n'grindin to a
filthy Salt-N-Pepa/Journey mix
one second; and screaming at the
top of their lungs to "Bohemian
Rhapsody" the next.
Some techno elitists whine
about Girl Talk's "unoriginal
material" and his gimmicky
shows, and they have a valid
point. But one Girl. Talk show
probably releases almost as much
energy as an A-bomb, and his
sampling skills make entirely
new songs out of old material.
As I limped out of the Blind
Pig with a sore neck and battered
body, I looked around me. People
from every demographic imag-
inable were in as much pain as I
was, but they couldn't stop rav-
ing. Like Dr. Frankenstein before
him, Greg Gillis' monster has
come to life, but instead of unit-
ing against it, the townsfolk have
gathered in the city square for a
grimy,sweaty techno oarty.

J. Cole to headline SpringFest

Taking the stage at
Hill Auditorium to
benefit C.S.. Mott
Children's Hospital
By GEOFF MARINO
Daily Arts Writer.
APRIL 6, 2012 - The Univer-
sity undoubtedly has a large stu-
dent body, but it's also true that
once football season ends, it can
be easy to forget the majesty of
our collective presence. MUSIC
Matters, a student club on cam-
pus, has made its mission to rec-
tify this.
The club has generated about
$100,000 in five months from
sponsors - such as the Office of
the President, the Office of Uni-
versity Development, UMS and
LSA - in order to attract a major
performer and organize a siz-

able event. This year, C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital will receive
proceeds from the event which
will be headlined by J. Cole, who
was nominated for Best New
Artist at this year's Grammys.
Phil Schermer, MUSIC Mat-
ters president and LSA sopho-
more, emphasized the club's
intention to draw the student
body to this major "capstone"
event. Today, MUSIC Matters
will host this' two-part event,
dubbed SpringFest.
The first part, which takes
place from 11a.m. to 2 p.m. today,
will feature student groups
advertising their clubs to pass-
ing students in a setup similar to
Festifall on the Diag. Unlike Fes-
tifall, though, the clubs will be"
accompanied by a capella groups
and other student entertainers
aimed to create a lively vibe to
attract students to the Diag.
The second event, co-hosted
by Pi Kana Aloha fraternity

and MUSIC Matters, will occur
tonight at 8 p.m. at Hill Audito-
rium, as J. Cole brings his talent
back to Ann Arbor.
But he won't be alone. MUSIC
Matters hosted a video competi-
tion between local dance and
rap groups to determine the
openers for J. Cole. On Sunday
night, it was announced that
the featured groups would be
dance groups EnCore, funKtion
and Dance2XS, as well as rap
groups Fairytale Productions
and D.S.B.
J. Cole described his support
for local musical acts and lauded
the benefits of including them in
bigger concerts.
"It's a great opportunity for
local artists to come through
and shine, and make some new
fans by performing in front of
a bunch of people who may not
have heard of them before," Cole
said in an interview with The
Michigan.Daily.

Famous 'Einstein
on the Beach' opera
comes to Ann Arbor

Glass to restage
seminal work at
* Power Center
By JON ODDEN AND DAVID
TAO
Daily Arts Writer and Senior Arts
Editor
JAN. 20, 2012 - Heralded as
one of the 20th century's great-
est examples of artistry, "Ein-
stein on the Beach," the radical
five-hour opera that elevated
director Robert Wilson and com-
poser Philip Glass to international
prominence, is being revived for
an international tour 20 years
after its last production. The
tour's first stop, and the opera's
first performance in North Amer-
ica outside of New York City, will
take place tonight in Ann Arbor.
While the opera involves the
titular physicist as a character
and'incorporates many elements
from his life, Glass and Wil-
son intentionally focused upon
Albert Einstein as a historical
figure instead of a cultural icon.
In place of biography, Glass and
Wilson actively embrace a lack
of narrative, incorporating sym-
bols such as repeated numbers,
syllables of soltege and abstract
dance sequences. They, along
with the production's original
choreographer, Lucinda Childs,
are involved with the opera's new
tour.
"In the (university) remount-
ing, the original creative team
... is in residence to pass on their
innovative aesthetic and distinc-
tive working methods onto a new
generation of performers," Musi-
cology Prof. Mark Clague and
director of research at the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, said.
The original team's noncon-
ventional approach extends
beyond the narrative and into the
production's underlying music.
Glass's arrangement forsakes tra-
ditional orchestral instrumenta-
tion for an eerie combination of
synthesizers, woodwinds and
voice. In lieu of intermissions,
audiences set their own breaks

and are free to walk in and out of
the theater at leisure.
When "Einstein on the Beach"
premiered in 1976, as Clague
explains, the opera's style was
misunderstood and over-simpli-
fied, described as Minimalist and
more than a little off-putting.
Musicians struggled to perform
the play as much as audiences
struggled to witness it due to its
lack of a clear narrative struc-
ture. However, Clague said he
believes that modern musicians
and popular taste have since
caught up.
"This ... is anything but (Mini-
malist)," Clague said. "The opera
was prophetic and today, art-
ists have developed the techni-
cal understandings to play it
and audiences can embrace the
concepts in ways that are freshly
intriguing."
When asked for suggestions
on how to comprehend "Ein-
stein," Clague said the audience
shouldn't concern itself with
meaning. Instead, it should try
and interact with the opera,
because its core theme is derived
from a combination of the perfor-
mance and the person.
"The most important thing
to know about 'Einstein on the
Beach' is that the audience mem-
ber brings the story to the the-
ater," Clague said. "Einstein was
a cultural icon - a conceptual
physicist certainly but also a phi-
losopher, humanitarian and a fig-
ure of worldwide notoriety."
After all, theoretical relativ-
ity fundamentally changed the
way we understood the universe,
shifting from an absolute notion
of time to one dependent on per-
spective, which Clague explained
is a central focus of the opera's
visual elements.
"Watch the stage change;
experience it as a kind of medi-
tation on symbols and signal-
ing itself," Clague said. "It's all
fascinating - the light, the slow,
detailed movements, the musical
environment. It'll be slightly dif-
ferent for everyone, but an audi-
ence member willing to give him
or herself to this artwork may
well be transformed."

Th' Undergrads bring sketch' to U'

Student-run
YouTube show
inspired by 'SNL'
By JOEY STEINBERGER
For the Daily
MARCH 12,2012 - The week-
end begins on Friday for most
college students. For some, this
means meeting up with a friend
or a chance to catch up on a book
you're reading for fun. For the
cast and crew of Th'Undergrads,
Fridays are a time to pitch a flur-
ry of ideas, draft the best ones
and film some sketch comedy.
Th'Undergrads is the Univer-
sity's first televised sketch com-
edy group. Last summer, School
of Music Theatre & Dance
senior RJ Brown and some of
his friends who act decided they
wanted to do a sketch-comedy
show. Brown approached LSA
senior lecturer Terri Sarris,
who connected him with two
groups of students who had the
same idea. In an interview, the

show's five producers gave their
thoughts on the production pro-
cess.
"Everyone had the pieces
that everyone else's group was
missing," said LSA junior Billy
Finkenstaedt.
Students in . the
Th'Undergrads come from a
wide variety of comedic back-
grounds, including those who
come from improv groups, oth-
ers who are actors or stand-up
comics, and even those who
were not involved in these pur-
suits before Th'Undergrads.
Because of this mix, LSA senior
Joey Bergen believes that the
group has a "wide range of dif-
ferent styles of humor and dif-
ferent approaches to humor."
"I was really worried that
we weren't going to mesh,"
added LSA senior Jacqueline
Wilton."But I think its been
OK."
The producers cite "Saturday
Night Live" as the group's big-
gest influence. Sketch-comedy
shows that use many camera
angles, such as "The State" and

"Mr. Show," also play a part in
the group's artistic decisions.
Unlike other sketch com-
edy groups on campus,
Th'Undergrads films sketches
and uploads them to YouTube.
They don't perform their com-
edy live ... yet.
"That was the initial goal,"
Finkenstaedt said. "It became a
goal for the end of this semes-
ter."
Part of the problem keeping
Th'Undergrads from live audi-
ences is their filming schedule.
Th'Undergrads films in th'e
basement of North Quad, and
because the building is owned
and operated by the University,'
the group has to conform to a
restrictive film schedule.
"If we could film later on
Fridays it would be easier to ...
secure an audience that could
stay for the length of shooting,"
Finkenstaedt said.
Though the Th'Undergrads
film schedule is less than ideal,
the group does feel as though
it benefits from its relationship
with the University.

"We get to use these awesome
sets and these incredible camer-
as that are not usually afforded
to people with our experience
level," Finkenstaedt added.
For now, fans of the show are
able to watch the group's antics
online. The show releases a
new, roughly 30-minute episode
every month. In the first epi-
sode, sketches include adivorced
game-show host whose cheating
wife appears as a contestant on
his show, and University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman dressed
as a dominatrix hosting a fire-
side chat.
They haven't heard anything
from the University about that
one yet.
At the writers' meeting this
month, sketch ideas included an
upbeat sitcom with the cast of
"The Silence of the Lambs" and
a lounge singer who forgets her
song mid-verse and is forced to
awkwardly improvise.. All the
writers were conscientious of
keeping the sketches original.
Some ideas were noted as too

folk groups of the '60s like The
Mamas and the Papas and Peter,
Paul and Mary. In last night's
show, Fleet Foxes incorporated
unlikely instruments including
the mandolin, flute and harmoni-
um - giving their songs a unique,
rustic flavor.
A giant screen greeted con-
certgoers with the cheeky phrase
"YOU ARE AT A MUSICAL CON-
CERT CONGRATULATIONS"
projected over a scenic picture-
postcard image of a mountain
range. The mostly college-aged
audience burst into applause
when Fleet Foxes opening act,
The Walkmen, took the stage.
The five East Coast-based

members of The Walkmen have
a driving and energetic garage-
band style.One particularly boun-
cy number, "Blue as your Blood,"
spurred two audience members to
alternately bounce up and down
in their seats like a see-saw.
Fleet Foxes took the stage after
a 15-minute set change, playing
songs from Helplessness Blues, as
well as hits from their eponymous
debut LP. After a long standing
ovation, the band returned to the
stage to play two encores. The
first, "I Let You," is a previously
unrecorded song that Pecknold
said he wrote a few months ago.
The band will stay in the
Midwest for the weekend, play-
ing shows in Chicago today and
tomorrow.

13 years after first
film, humor and
shenanigans return
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
APRIL 6, 2012 - "Hey, do you
want to have sex with us right
now?" Jason Biggsasked. "I know
we just met, brother, but there's a
fuckinglock on that door, right?"
Since it would be a blatant
breach of journalistic ethics, this
writer for The Michigan Daily
respectfully declined, politely,
pointing out that the windows in
the group-study rooms at Ross
are in fact, two-way, before pro-
ceeding with an interview with
the cast and crew of "American
Reunion": writers/directors Jon
Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg
("Harold and Kumar" films), star
Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finch), and
the apple pie paramour himself,
Jason Biggs (Jim).
It's been a long 13 years since
the first "American Pie" launched
a new generation of teen-sex com-
edies and nine years since the
last non-direct-to-video sequel,
"American Wedding." But the
original cast wasn't always keen
about reuniting for yet another
installment.
"No one thought after ("Ameri-
can Wedding") that there was
going to be one, and the idea, on
the surface, wasn't that appeal-
ing," Thomas said. "(Hurwitz
and Schlossberg) wrote a qual-
ity script, and I know that's what
got everybody on board. It's hard
to find good movies, period, to
make. Whether it was.'American
Pie 4' or a whole other film, it's
just a good, funny script, which
got everybody to say 'Alright, I'll
do it.'"
Because of storytelling and
scheduling issues, members of-
the core cast were dropped for
2003's "American Wedding,"
including Chris Klein (Oz), Tara
Reid (Vicky) and Mena Suvari

0

(Heather). But Hurwitz and
Schlossberg were insistent that
they and everyone else were
game before "Reunion" moved
forward - this meant every-
one, including Jim's foreign
exchange crush Nadia (Shannon
Elizabeth), the MILF Guys and
The Sherminator.
"You wanted to bring back all
the favorites from that first film,"
Schlossberg said. "The hope was
that once you started getting
some of the cast, the rest of the
cast would jump on board."
Hurwitz added: "If these guys
hadn't signed on board, Tara
Reid would have played every
character. It would have been
Eddie Murphy style."
As newcomers to the "Ameri-
can Pie" franchise, Hurwitz and
Schlossberg were brought on for
their dual-threat capability -
not only did the duo create, write
and direct the entirety of the leg-
endarily raunchy "Harold and
Kumar" trilogy, they are devo-
tees of the "American Pie" films.
"These guys know these mov-
ies better than any other human
being walking on the planet - to
a scary degree," Thomas said.
Biggs related an anecdote
from their flight to Detroit that
explicated the breadth of the
pair's fandom.
"I looked over,' (Schlossberg)
puts his earphones into his
iPhone," Biggs recounted. "I'm
like 'What're you watching?'"
because I'm nosy as shit. And it's
'American Pie 1.' He was like 'I
just wanted to double check the
Uncle Mort reference in 'Ameri-
can Pie 1' and see what scene it
was in."' "
"When you're doing a sequel,
you want to make sure."
Schlossberg began.
."Yeah, especially six, seven,
eight months later, after the
movie's already been locked into
the can, you want to be able to
reference it on the flight," Biggs
interrupted.
"I was sitting next to Jason
Biges, I wanted to imoress him."

Schlossberg said.
But when it came to writing
the story, the duo knew they had
to inject fresh material among
the recurring jokes' and call-
backs to the previous films.
"When we were first
approached with the idea of
doing the movie, Jon and I
started thinking about differ-
ent ideas, and the first idea that
came into our heads was that
Jim's mom is dead," Schlossberg
said.
"You sick fucks. You sick, sick,
fucks," Biggs exclaimed.
"The truth of the matter is,
when you have'someone like
Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad) and
you see that he's been put in the
position where he's been doing
the same thing every movie,"
Hurwitz said. "We were looking
to give Eugene (more to do)."
"It's kind of a genius idea - to
introduce death into the 'Ameri-
can Pie' franchise is conceptu-
ally ridiculous," Biggs said. "But
it's so smart and so good, it's one'
of my favorite things about the
movie because, first of all it adds
some poignancy, which there is a
lot of in this movie, despite what
you maay have gathered from the
present company."
Though pathos is pumped
up, so are the sex-crazed she-
nanigans that would make even
Tracy Morgan blush. While Jim
romancing a pie was boundary-
pushing in 1999, Jim running
around in a gimp suit for an
extended sequence is one of the
tamer scenes in 2012.
"When we were on set, you
shoot those long days and like,
on hour 15, I'd have a long con-
versdtion with Biggs," Thomas
narrated. "I'm like 'Yeah, I think
the country is headed in the right
direction, how do you feel about
Obama' and he's got leather studs
on his cock."
Now with kids and careers,
the hormonal teens from "Amer-
ican Pie" have certainly evolved
and matured - thankfully, the
humor hasn't one bit.

Tributessss ... make it work.
material it's inspired by.
To most, the story is familiar.
Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Law-
rence, "Winter's Bone") lives
with her mother and younger
sister Prim (newcomer Willow
Shields) in an exhausted part of
District 12 called the Seam. As
happens annually, all children
between the ages of 12 and 18
from the 12 districts have to sub-
mit their names for the Hunger
Games - a competition in which
24 children battle to the death,
used by the Capitol to maintain
totalitarian control. When her
12-year-old sister is picked to
compete, Katniss volunteers in
Prim's place.

When it comes to the Capitol,
Ross lets his imagination fly. It's
precisely as over-the-top, color-
ful and extravagant as readers
undoubtedly expected. But just
as Katniss and fellow District 12
tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson,
"The Kids Are All Right") are
pawns inthe Capitol'sgames, the
Capitol is a pawn in Ross's game.
It's a means for him to break the
emotional intensity of the games
themselves, to occasionally hide
the fact that under the love tri-
angle most teenagers in the audi-
ence have come to see, this film
is actually about survival, death,
desperation and unrestrained

The lyrics of "Shake It Out"
are poetic as always but still
relatable, much like the pop-
inspired sound of the single.
While Lungs was written as a
girl-power response to a break-
up, Ceremonials is an affirma-
tion of Florence's strength and
independence even with a man in
her life (yeah, she got back with
her ex).
It's easy to get carried away in
the inflated nature of Ceremoni-
als. Florence's most memorable
tracks of the album, however, are
the ones that stray furthest from
lavishness. In "Breaking Down,"
she exposes her vulnerability, an
eerily cheery piano accompany-
ing lyrics centering on madness.
In "Lover to Lover," Florence
muses on a loose lifestyle, admit-
ting she has no chance of salva-
tion. But she repeatedly shrieks,
"that's all right" - beautifully, of
course, because Florence is never
capable of uttering an inharmon-
ic note.
Florence even dabbles in
unabashed discordance in
"Remain Nameless," atrackcom-
manded by an electronic beat and
unrelenting coolness. It starts
slowly, a sense of unpredictabil-
ity underneath its superficial
tameness, but comes together in
the end with Florence's emphatic
request -for her darling to call
her whenever he needs her. The
track is clubbier than Flo fans are
used to, but it shouldn't be disre-
garded as mere experimentation
with the electronic genre.
With that in mind, consider
that the band almost went pop
for its sophomore album, propo-
sitioned by various U.S. produc-
ers. But Florence explained her
ultimate decision to reject the
enticement of pop in a Billboard
interview: "No. No. No. No. No! I
can't do that. This is too weird. I
can't just suddenly leave behind
everything that made Lungs."
And for that, Florence fans may
thank heaven or salvation or
demons or any ofthe other inspi-
rations for Ceremonials.

severed head currently decorates
a mildly polarizing "Game of
Thrones" promotional poster that
screams "Look at us! We killed
our lead in the first season, which
means we're edgy and shocking
and unpredictable!"
The poster is a bit much, but
its message holds true - in its
second season premiere, the tale
of political intrigue and decep-
tion that captivated audiences last

times, it's certainly flinch-worthy
material.
Yet, beneath all the horror and
blood and crimes against nature
lie the things that make "Game
of Thrones" the best drama any-
body has made in averylongtime.
There's the wonderfully devel-
oped ensemble, which despite
- and in many cases, due specifi-
cally to - Ned Stark's beheading,
has come into its own. There's
Ned's son Robb (Richard Mad-
den), who returns as a seasoned
battle commander, with three
victories under his belt as he reb-
els against the crown. There's
Ned's widow, Catelyn (Michelle
Fairley), looking on helplessly as
her son is prematurely snatched
from her by the responsibilities
of adulthood. And there's Ned's
murderer, the aforementioned
boy king, whose love for opulence
and taste for sadism make for the
most easily hateable character in
recent memory.
But it's in the Westerosi capital
of King's Landing where the show
really picks up, giving us charac-
ters at their most vulnerable and
most devious. Cersei, who rose to
Queen Regent at Ned's expense,
reveals just how tenuous her grip
on power really is, as she reacts in
constant frustration to her son's
spoiled insolence. Her mental
instability is further exacerbated
by the arrival of her dwarf-broth-

er Tyrion (Peter Dinklage, who
won an Emmy for his perfor-
mance last season), whom their
father has sent to babysit. Ridi-
culed and underestimated due to
his stature, Tyrion delights in his
newly acquired power, pointing
out his sister's mistakes with glee
and swiftly consolidating control.
Sitting among it all is Littlefin-
ger (the perpetually underrated
Aidan Gillen), the kingdom's self-
made master of coin, who prag-
matically plays all ends against
the middle.
The performances them-
selves are leagues beyond even
pay-cable, but the characters'
interactions are the show's most
fascinating element, as we track
the machinations of the titular
"Game." In one particularly pow-
erful scene, Littlefinger reminds
Cersei that "knowledge is power."
Cersei responds by ordering
her guards to seize him and slit
his throat, changing her mind
at the last second as Littlefin-
ger squirms. "Power is power,"
remarks Cersei as she orders her
guards away, earning herself a
moment of smug satisfaction.
She doesn't seem to know that
she's earned herself a long win-
ter's worth of Littlefinger's enmi-
ty, but as we jeer (or cheer, as the
case may be), we know for a fact
that we're in for a long season's
worth of exceptional entertain-

Best Albums
1.JayZ&Kanye
West-Watch the
Throne
JAN. 5, 2012 - The ostentatious, Rolly-on-my-arm, Bentleys-and-broads
rap - ubiquitous on Watch the Throne - is nothing spectacularly original.
But what separates Jay and Ye from the other McMillionaire clowns is the
scope and vision that propelled them to their Beyonce-shaped winner's
circle in the first place.
Throughout their careers, Ye-Z have succeeded by eschewing rap stereo-
types rather than attaching space-shuttle-sized engines to the back of them
and blasting that shit into outer space.
Watch the Throne is no different. Ye-Z plant their Yves Saint Laurent flag
everywhere, conquering foes like dubstep, Lex Luger and Frank Ocean with
German shepherd snarls and Genghis Khan cries. And they probably aren't
even trying that hard. Jay-Z and Kanye West chum around like old pals on
Watch the Throne, trading verses like Pokemon cards, proving, once and for
all, that game truly does recognize game.

Best TV Shows
1. Game of Thrones
JAN. 5, 2012 - In its heyday, HBO created programs that transcended
genres and offered something for everyone. With "Game of Thrones,"
HBO has worked its magic again, turning George R.R. Martin's fantasy
saga into a refreshingly audacious program with incredible mass appeal.
The show's set in a wvorld where seasons last for years and dragons
used to fly around. But that's largely ignored. Instead, HBO presents a
delightfully dark tale full of political and military intrigue. Armies move
at the behest of lords manipulated by seemingly minor players, such as
Littlefinger and the Imp - Tyrion Lannister - who truly run the show.
Illusions of chivalry and grace are shattered by pragmatism and horror.
Elaborate plots and wry wit are a credit to the writers room. The cin-
ematography and production design are a testament to HBO's attitude of
"Budget? Psh, we can pay for it with Skinemax." And of course, there's
that final, shocking beheading.

1 Drive
JAN. 5, 2012 - A guy supplements his income by getaway driving for
the Los Angeles underworld and becomes trapped between the mafia
and the woman he loves. It sounds utterly conventional, yet somehow,
"Drive" defies expectations, an example of everything Hollywood's
missing.
Director Nicolas Winding Refn's masterpiece is more arthouse than
blockbuster, but it isn't the arrogant wish-fulfillment of "Midnight in
Paris," nor is it Terrence Malick's, "I studied philosophy at Harvard"
brand of condescension. Refn takes us back to a time when filmmakers
cared about how their films looked, designing the composition of each
frame, each action set piece, each incredibly choreographed outburst of
white-hot violence, with meticulous detail. With the help of lead actor
Ryan Gosling, who turns in his best performance, Refn's film reinvigo-

Best Albums of 2011

2. The Black Keys
- El Camino
JAN. 5, 2012 - The boys have done it again. El
Camino, the latest album from bluesy-rock duo The
Black Keys, sounds pretty much like the rest of their
six albums - and for that, you may thank them.
Hardly pausing to catch a breath after 2010's
bold and brazen Brothers, the band's El Camino is a
loud and crunchy riff-ridden album that continues
to satisfy.
El Camino revs up with the single "Lonely Boy,"
a tireless hymn about - what else is new - love
and loneliness. The album combines the noise and
grit of the boys with melodic chiming and a few
la's and whoa's of a chorus - few surprises, but
endless delights.
It's difficult to have too strong of a reaction to
El Camino. It isn't groundbreaking, but it is clas-
sic Black Keys. Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney
have been at it for a decade now, and don't worry
- they know what they're doing.

FOSTERTH EPEOPLE
COLUMBIA
3. Foster the
People - Torches
JAN. 5, 2012 - It's hard to believe Foster the
People just released Torches last spring. In just
seven months, the album has soared to the top of
pop and rock charts and the group has accumu-
lated a variety of music award nominations.
But there's a reason for all the hype - Torches
has enough electrifying synth lines and static-y
vocals to nourish the hippest Urban Outfitters
playlist.
While it may be tempting to get caught up in
the hit single "Pumped Up Kicks," the rest of the
album is just as tantalizing. Each track stands out
from the others with its own catchy twist. It's live-
ly and unpredictable while still sounding polished
and cohesive: There is never a boring beat, yet
nothing sounds out of place. And to think - this
is only Foster the People's first shot at releasing an
album.

4. The Roots
Undun
JAN. 5, 2012 - Young men dealt an impossible
hand in drug-worn, forgotten neighborhoods aren't
exactly few and far between inhip hop. But The Roots
manage to bring an old theme back to life - a plain-
tively melodic, literally backwards life - on Undun,
the group's second album since shacking up with-
Jimmy Fallon's show. Nothing makes protagonist
Redford Stevens (musically related to Sufjan, whose
song"Redford" makes an appearance)unusual, which
is precisely what makes the album extraordinary.
Undun is the concept-album versionof "The Wire,"
a hard look at reality on the streets, as Redford's story
is traced from death to birth in the present tense. The
album highlights Roots ringleaders "?uestlove" and
Black Thought in equal parts: The former funnel-
ing soul, classical and indie harmonies into his gen-
tly rolling downtempo journey, the latter poignantly
recalling a narrative he grew up alongside - a narra-
tive that could have been his.
-SHARON JACOBS

5. Cut Copy -
Zonoscope
JAN. 5, 2012 - At times, dance records can be
annoyingly functional, made solely with the intent
of being played ata club or party.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, bands
like LCD Soundsystem and Hot Chip hhve cre-
ated a whole new genre of ironic dance tracks
with snarky and sarcastic lyrics as easily enjoyed
on personal headphones as they are pumping
through loud speakers.
Cut Copy straddles this line as well as any band.
Neither planting its tongue too firmly in its cheek,
nor blindly escaping to a DJ booth, the Australian
quartet have been refining their craft for eight
years now, and Zonoscope - the band's third effort
- is hands down its finest to date.
Zonoscope is a truly versatile album with slight
hints of wit sprinkled across shameless dance
tracks, making it an appropriate selection for
many occasions.

Student-run station
balances tradition
and the Internet
By GEOFF MARINO
DailyArts Writer
JAN. 30, 2012 - In the base-
ment of the Student Activities
Building, nestled alongside that
dreaded area 'U' students visits
only after losing their MCard, is
the student radio station, WCBN.
The station defines itself as:
"A student-run community free-
form radio station" that broad-
casts to the "University and its
surrounding communities." Of
course, what exactly freeform
entails is up to interpretation,
but in the world of radio, the
term brings to mind the model
of the longest-running freeform
radio station, New Jersey-based
WFMU. WCBN and WFMUpro-
vide DJs with total control over
the content of their shows.
WCBN has been operating
for about 40 years, and today's
increasingly Internet-based
music culture has put its philos-
ophy under pressure. With the
emergence of streaming services
and the music blog, the utility of
traditional radio is brought into
question. The average music
lover might think: Why should
I have music fed to me through
radio when my favorite blog and
Pandora can help me find what I
like?
Rackham student Ben Yee,
general manager of WCBN,
revealed that he thinks Internet
music services such as Pandora,
Spotify, Grooveshark and Turn-
table.fm aren't necessarily com-

petitors with WCBN and that
Internet music services and free-
form radio have separate utili-
ties.
"There's two different mind-
sets," Yee said. "I'll be honest,
there are times when I'm doing
work and I can't listen to WCBN
because it commands my atten-
tion. On the other hand, I can go
on Pandora, put in the names of a
few ambient artists, and let it roll
for five hours and I don't even
notice it's there."
Yet it's hard to know when a
listener might prefer the active
listening experience that the
station provides. Those Internet
services may be easier to shut out
than the unusual tracks found
on 88.3 FM, but individuals who
crave active listening can turn
on Pandora and be satisfied. In
clarifying its role, WCBN seeks
to offer more.
"We are the original music
blog," Yee said about the sta-
tion's role as he elaborated upon
the differences between free-
form radio DJs and music blogs.
He highlighted the personal
aspect of music discovery and
its importance in balancing out
the more depersonalizing effects
of the Internet, citing a real-life
encounter with a fan of a partic-
ular DJ, Heidi Madagame, from
WCBN.
"I went to Little Caesars Pizza
the other day, and someone
looked at my shirt and said, 'Hey,
you're with that radio station?
Yeah, that Heidi girl, she had a.
great show the other day. I really
liked it.' The guy talked about her
for five minutes," Yee said.
WCBN prides itself on those
kinds of connections, valuing the
community aspect it can provide.

Unlike Internet music sites, in
which the listener interacts with
a computer, WCBN wants to fos-
ter the experience of communal
music listening.
But when asked whether
WCBN will embrace the Inter-
net, he stuck to his philosophy of
integration rather than competi-
tion.
"A radio station isn't real-
ly going to succeed unless it
embraces the Internet," he said.
Ambitious developments
are planned. The station has
been authorized by the FCC to
increase its terrestrial transmit-
ting capacity from 300 watts to
2,000 watts, an effect that will
expand its reach to cover areas
such as Dexter, Ypsilanti, Saline
and even part of Chelsea.
This spirit of development
will be carried to the Internet. A
new website will allow listeners
to interact with the DJ and oth-
ers who are listening, fostering
interaction and group explora-
tion of music.
"Back in the day, listening to
music was a group experience,"
he said. "Being able to recreate
something like that, where peo-
ple can stop by, talk about the
music, and be able to figure out
from other people what's simi-
lar out there, would be a way of
creating a community around
the radio station."
These developments intend
to offer the greater Ann Arbor
area another opti~n to explore
music interactively, and the zeal
for further expansion is certain-
ly there. When asked about the
future of WCBN, Yee expressed
optimism.
"We want to take over the
world," Yee said.

COMEDY
From Page 3D
similar to a sketch in "SNL" or a
scene in "Family Guy."
Th'Undergrads hopes to have
members of football team on the
show in an upcoming episode.
"We're not so closely tied with
Michigan but ... we are trying to
represent (that) we are Michigan
students and we put this togeth-
er," said LSA junior Nick Drew.
As students, the producers dis-
cussed how it has been difficult to
juggle course work with involve-
ment in Th'Undergrads. While
a few individuals are receiving

independent-study credit for the
project, others have classes that
don't relate.
"We have to ... stay up real-
ly late nights," Brown said.
"Th'Undergrads has now become
a primary engagement."
"Th'Undergrads is more impor-
tant to me ... a lot of my classes
are just theory, and this is actual
hands-on working with people,"
Drew added.
Furthermore, the show's pro-
ducers have had to learn a lot from
scratch because they're a new stu-
dent group.
"A lot of it is on-the-fly learn-
ing," Drew said. "It can be a clus-

ter-mess at times."
"(For) the first episode, we shot
eight sketches in one day," Brown
added. "We finished at 4 p.m. and
had all eight sketches shot ... we
learned that this is a machine that
is going to be oiled and it's only
going to get better."
Students interested in becom-
ing involved with Th'undergrads
should look for them in the fall.
"Hopefully; next semester,
auditions will be held, writers'
applications submitted and crew
applications submitted;" Brown
said. "We're hoping to open this
up now that our name is out
there."


GAMES
From Page 4D
animalistic instincts.
Execs at Lionsgate must have
really pushed hard for the film's
PG-13 rating. While not as Tar-
antino-esque as most would have
liked, "The Hunger Games" stays
true to the blood and gore of the
first book. Herein lies the film's
greatest strength - it's all about
raw emotion. There are no obtru-
sive, overwhelming soundtracks
that detract from the emotional
trauma of the lead actors at the
death of their friends.
This organic approach allows
the actors to shine in their roles.
Hutcherson is believably love-

stricken and embattled as the
guy who knows he can't win
but wants to make sure the
girl he loves does. Woody Har-
relson, as the tributes' mentor
Haymitch, is equally perfect as a
drunk mess trying to get his act
together. Of course, no one can
forget the adorably naive Effie
Trinket (Elizabeth Banks, TV's
"30 Rock"). Her comedic one-
liners are as invaluable as Donald
Sutherland's ("Horrible Bosses")
cold stares as President Snow.
But while the games have two
winners, the film only has one.
Lawrence is a powerhouse of
talent. She churns out arrogant,
impatient, sweet, sexy, trauma-
tized and desperate faster than

the speed of one of Katniss'S
arrows.
There's no other way of saying
it - this film is a cornucopia of
surprises. Instead of capitalizing
on its love triangle, it sticks to its
roots and captures the frustra-
tion of an oppressed society that's
just trying to survive. More than
anything, it's a beautiful ode to
'hunger' and 'passion' - the hun-
ger that drives people physically
and emotionally, the passion that
causes people to act against their
better judgement. As such, "The
Hunger Games" definitely leaves
you craving more.
So long brooding, pouting
vampires - this is how a young-
adult adaptation is done.

FOOTBALL
Tim Ro an: Those
w ho stay will
redeem themselves

Those who stay will
redeem themselves.
Ryan Van Bergen
stayed.
While his
teammates
mobbed
Courtney
Avery, whose
interception
for the Michi--
gan football TIM
team sealed ROHAN
the 40-34 win
over Ohio State on Saturday, Van
Bergen slowly walked to the side-
line, his hands on his head.
He flipped off his helmet,
collapsed on the blue bench and
wept.
The crowd's roar was deaf-
ening as Jake Ryan pulled Van
Bergen close, whispering in his
ear. Then Craig Roh did the same.
They told Van Bergen how much
his leadership meant, how much
of an impact he had on them.
The fifth-year senior had to
answer for why the defense was
so bad for three years. Now, he
could stand proudly and boast
about one of the best units in
the country.
"Michigan probably needed
this win to solidify what we've
done this season asa program,"
Van Bergen said after the game.
"This game is more than a win in
the win column. It's bigger than
that. It encompasses way more.
Our team feels like we finished
the season.... We went out the
way we wanted to go out.
"We put Team 132 in the
books forever. I think this team
will always be remembered
as the team that set a new
standard and re-established
what Michigan is supposed to
be about. I'm just glad I was a
senior, being a part of it."
Denard Robinson stayed.
When the game ended, he led
the sprint to the student section
to sing "The Victors." His 337
total yards and five touchdowns
will be a part of history, but
Team 132 will'emember how
he willed Michigan to finally
beat the Buckeyes.
Brady Hoke finally found bal-
ance for Robinson in a "make-
shift" offense, one that fit the
quarterback who once thought
of transferring before Hoke
arrived in January.
Now, the quarterback who
had been beaten up - by his
critics and by Big Ten defenses
- smiled wider than ever.
"I'm just glad I'm play-
ing with these guys because I
wouldn't rather be (anywhere)
else," Robinson said.
"I'm glad I stayed."
Mike Martin stayed.
The team's best defensive
player on a few of Michigan's
worst defenses finally was a
part of a true Michigan defense.
Martin,.Van Bergen and fifth-
year senior defensive tackle

Will Heininger stepped back
from the mob that started to
rush the field.
"We just kind of stood out
there and soaked it in -what
this team had done," Martin
said.
David Molk stayed.
He anchored the offensive
line Robinson turned to in the
fourth quarter when the Wol-
verines needed to ice the game.
"We're going to ride you
guys," Robinson told them.
"You're going to win this for
us."
Molk, the centerwith-wmmten
streak, became the lifeline
of Hoke's offense, protecting
Robinson and guiding a power-
ful run game. The injuries that
plagued his career became an
afterthought.
When it was done, the usually
even-keeled Molk laughed the
loudest.
"It's been a long time," Molk
said. "I've been through a lot of
stuff. But then again, in the end,
you truly realize what this place
means.
"I love Michigan, there's
no doubt about it. I don't care
what we had to go through.
I love this school. I love this
university. I love this team. I
love my teammates. I love my
coaches. This is great. This is
what college football is. (I'll)
never forget it."
Senior receivers Kevin Koger,
Junior Hemingway and Mar-
tavious Odoms all stayed, and
they all caught touchdown pass-
es against the Buckeyes.
Those who stayed were
around long enough to see
Hoke's countdown clocks be
reset - on Sunday, one of them
read "zero" days since Michigan
last beat "Ohio," the other read
"364 days" until the next edi-
tion of The Game.
Many seniors watched the
finale unfold from the sidelines,
their reward for staying being
a kiss on the cheek from Hoke
and a personalized Michigan
football from the pregame
senior day festivities.
Still, those who stayed will
forever be known as Brady
Hoke's first team - Team 132, as
he calls them - immortalized
just like Bo Schembechler's first
team in 1969.
When Schembecher told
that team, "Those who stay will
be champions," he didn't inher-
it the 110th-ranked defense.
His quarterback wasn't an
enigma.
We've learned that some-
times those who stay will
have to endure. They will be
ridiculed. They will be embar-
rassed, playing through the
worst three years in the his-
tory of Michigan football. They-
will represent a dark age, one
unknown to anyone before their
time. They will be considered

the children of a prestigious
program that just don't fit in.
If Team 132 has taught us
anything, it's that there won't
always be championships for
those who stay, but there will
be glory.
Those who stay will knock
off Notre Dame under the lights
at Michi n Stadium. They'll
demolish Nebraska, welcoming
Big Red to the Big Ten the way
Michigan teams of old would.
And, above all, those whostay
will beat Ohio State, completing
their journey from forgettable
to legendary.
Those who stay will bring
back Michigan football.
They immediately bought into
a magical coach and didn't look
back. Hoke taught them how to
play "Michigan football," when
they admittedly didn't know the
meaning of the phrase.
He made sure the Ohio State
game would be the most impor-
tant of their lives. Molk said The
Game was emphasized "a thou-
sand times" more than during the
three-year Rich Rodriguez era,
and they'll remember this win -
the one that ended Ohio State's
seven-year win streak - forever.
Those who stay will love
Brady Hoke and all he stands
for. They'll play for him because
he loved them first.
"He is us; we are him," Molk
said. "I love him. I love how he
coaches. I love his leadership
ability and how he does it. I'd do
anything for him.
"IfI ever (come) back, 20
years from now, the first guyI
would find, I would call coach
Hoke. That's who he is."
When the fans rushed the
field, the seniors who stayed
thought, "finally," as Van Ber-
gen did, and the win over Ohio
State brought them to tears.
They drenched Hoke in water,
then hugged him.
One student in the stands
stayed. She held a sign that read:
"Brady, thanks for making our
senior year."
Eventually, Team 132 left
the Michigan family on the
field and gathered in the locker
room. An emotional Hoke told
them how he's "proud of them
and what they've done for
Michigan."
"Just to see them happy,
that's the neat part," Hoke said.
"I mean; the investment and
commitment they've made as
a team. It's special. It's special.
It's one of those good days."
Those who stayed huddled
together one last time in the Big
House.
Van Bergen shouted, "Team
132 'til the death."
For having stayed, they got to
sing "The Victors." And it will
never again sound so sweet.

Michigan wins first Big
Ten Title since 1986

After considering NBA
move, Trey Burke to stay

By LUCAS PASCH
- Daily Sports Editor
MARCH 5, 2012 - With just
a few ticks left against Michigan
State on Sunday afternoon, Ohio
State guard William Buford drib-
bled right-to-left along the perim-
eter and pulled up just inside the
top of the arc for a last-second
prayer.
He didn't get a good look at the
basket, fading away with Spartan
guard Keith Appling in his face,
but -the shot was pure. Buford,
who was money throughout the
contest, found the bottom of the
net to lift the Buckeyes to a 72-70
win over the Spartans in East
Lansing.
As the senior backpedaled with
a nonchalant grin on his face, the
team lounge at Michigan's Player
Development Center in Ann Arbor
erupted. The Wolverines had just
arrived home following their 71-65
victory at Penn State, and with
Buford's clutch bucket, Michigan,
Ohio State and Michigan State
each came away with a share of
the Big Ten regular-season title.
After beatingthe Nittany Lions
earlier in the afternoon, the Wol-
verines downplayed the signifi-
cance of the Buckeye-Spartan
matchup, noting that they did
everything in their power and
they couldn't worry about what
would happen.
"I've got a five-page paper to
write for tomorrow that I've real-
ly got to start working on," senior
guard Stu Douglass joked after
the game. "I've got to find my pri-
orities, set them straight."
But it was clear as soon as Ohio
State won what the title meant
to Michigan's players. Senior
guard and co-captain Zack Novak
immediately took to Twitter and

typed out one word: "Champs."
"I think everybody was hold-
ing their breath - the room got
quiet real quickly," said sopho-
more guard Tim Hardaway Jr. of
Buford's last-second shot. "Every-
body just froze for half-a-second,
and once the shot went in, the
place erupted."
Crisler Center will see a new
regular-season-title banner for
the first time since 1986, when
Michigan all-time scoring leader
Glen Rice finished up his impres-
sive freshman campaign. The
past 26 years have been quite the
championship drought.
Touted early-90s recruits Jalen
Rose and Chris Webber couldn't
deliver one, but the unsung duo
of Novak and Douglass - who
formed coach John Beilein's first
recruiting class in Ann Arbor -
did just that.
"First Big Ten Championship
in (26) years," Novak said on
Sunday night. "For everybody on
this team - you seethe reunions,
we've had a few since we've been
here - guys will come back, and
this is the Big Ten Championship
team from this year. This team
won this championship. We're
going to be able to do that."
Before the season, few analysts
predicted that Michigan would
vie for a title by season's end, and
after the Wolverines suffered
their first home loss of the sea-
son on senior night to Purdue last
weekend, the projections seemed
accurate. Ohio State fell on its
senior night that weekend as well,
and all Michigan State had to do
to wrap up the outright title was
win one of its last two matchups.
But in an unlikely twist,
Indiana denied the Spartans in
Bloomington on Tuesday, 70-55,
and Buford took care of the rest

on Sunday.
"The most rewarding part of
what just happened is watching
our young men's faces," Beilein
said after Ohio State took care of
business.. "When you coach this,
long, and our staff knows this, it's
not about the Ws, it's about the
journey. ... It's certainly a high-
light in this year's journey, and for
some guys, a four-year journey."
Despite the slip-up against
the Boilermakers last week, the
Wolverines will enter the Big Ten
Tournament in Indianapolis this
weekend on a roll, having won six
of their last seven contests.
In accordance with the tie-
breaker rule - how the three
first-place teams fared against
fourth-place Wisconsin this sea-
son - Michigan State (2-0) gets
the No. 1 seed in the conference
tournament, Michigan (1-0) the
No. 2 seed and Ohio State (1-1) the
No. 3 seed. The three teams, plus
the fourth-seeded Badgers, all
receive first-round byes.
Michigan will tip off on Friday
night at 6:30 against the winner
of the game between No. 7 seed
Northwestern and No. 10 seed
Minnesota on Thursday. Should
the Wildcats win, the Wolverines
will have their hands full on Fri-
day, as they needed overtime to
subdue Northwestern in both of
their meetings this season.
But for now, Michigan will rest
up and enjoy the title they right-
fully earned.
"All I know is, this is a really
good cup of coffee," Beilein
quipped. "I might have a really
good glass of wine when I go
home, and the coffee the next
morning will really taste good.
That's when it will sink in, prob-
ably tomorrow morning, when I
make my first cup of coffee."

Daily Sports Editor
APRIL 9, 2012 - Trey Burke
was told he should stay. He was
told he should go. He was lean-
ing toward staying in school,
and he was leaning toward
going pro. He solicited his fam-
ily members and coaches for
advice, and he was given unso-
licited advice from fans and rival
athletic directors.
When he was done being
stretched every which way, the
freshman point guard decided
he'll stay at Michigan for his
sophomore season.
"I just felt like I could develop
more, and we have a great shot of
competing for another Big Ten
Championship and competing
for a national championship,"
Burke said in a press conference
yesterday.
After Michigan's season
ended in a 65-60 loss to Ohio in
the second round of the NCAA
Tournament, Burke started to
look at his NBA Draft prospects.
He consulted the NBA Draft
Advisory Board, and though he
didn't reveal what the board told
him, Burke said that the uncer-
tainty of where he would go in
the draft contributed to his deci-
sion to stay. He was projected
to be a second-round pick by
ESPN's Chad Ford.
Last Wednesday, rumors and
reports swirled that Burke had
decided to declare for the June
28 NBA Draft, but coincidental-
ly, that was the day Burke said he
decided to stay put. It could have
been that the reports were erro-
neous, or that Burke changed his
mind in the wake of the media
firestorm.
"(There) was a point where I
was considering leaving," Burke
said. "I was never really two feet
all the way in. Sometimes I was

was more coming back. After
talking it over with the coaches
and with my family ... I think
that was the best decision for me.
It was more of a risk for me to
leave (and) declare for the NBA
Draft."
Burke said the main thing
he would need to improve on to
become an NBA-caliber point
guard is his strength.
For a few days, Michigan fans
thought that their prized point
guard would be gone and that
the Wolverines-would need to
find a replacement, just as they
had done the year before when
Burke took over for point guard
Darius Morris, who left for the
NBA after his sophomore year.
Burke said he consulted Mor-
ris as he made his decision, and
Morris told him to make sure he
would have no regrets about-his
choice. Burke said he ultimately
made his decision on Wednesday
during his drive home to Colum-
bus.
With Burke's return, Michi-
gan remains a projected top-
10 team in the country next
season, aided by the arrival of
recruits Glenn Robinson III,
Mitch McGary, Nik Stauskas and
recently added point guard Spike
Albrecht.
"Losing our first game to Ohio
was one of the most disappoint-
ing times of the year for us,"
Burke said. "And I just felt like
we have some unfinished busi-
ness. With the recruits coming
in, with the returning players, I
feel like we have a great chance
of winning a national champion-
ship.
"I just saw how bright the
future was for this team."
It's the third-straight offsea-
son that Michigan coach John
Beilein has dealt withhaving his
best talent set their sights a little
higher. After the 2009-10 season,

his junior year, and last season,
Morris entered the draft after
his second year.
Burke could have continued
the trend, but he chose to go the
other way.
"It's a good problem to have,"
Beilein said. "We've got some
young men that really have
potential to play in the NBA, so
we want them to look at this,
take their time, do it the right
way.We never want them to have
any regrets."
Burke's teammates were
largely uninvolved in the deci-
sion.
"Some of us would talk to
him here and there," sopho-
more guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
said. "But we knew it was a lot of
stress dealing with this, and we
tried to stand back as far as pos-
sible because we know it was a
tough decision."
Burke defied all expectations
this season. He turned out to be
just as good, or even better, than
Morris, leading Michigan to its
first Big Ten Championship since
1986 and racking up plenty of
accolades for it. After averaging
14.8 points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.6
assists, he was named Big Ten
co-Freshman of the Year, select-
ed to the All-Big Ten Second
Team and got the nod as an AP
All-America honorable mention.
He continued -to challenge
these expectations well after-the
season ended. Fans were sur-
prised when his father said that
Burke was -"seriously consider-
ing" entering the draft, and he
dropped another surprise when
he decided to remain at Michi-
gan after many outside of the
program were resigned to him
leaving.
"Time will say what was the
best decision for him," Beilein
said. "I think it was a great
decision for Michigan basket-

Bakich named new
Michigan baseball coach

By LIZ NAGLE and MATT
SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer and Daily
Sports Editor
JUNE 29,2012 - On Wednes-
day, the University athletic
department announced that Erik
Bakich will be the 19th Michi-
gan baseball head coach in the
program's history, following a
nationwide search that began
when former coach Rich Malo-
ney and the Wolverines parted
ways on May 22.
Bakich, 34, is widely regarded
as one of the brightest young
minds in college baseball, as well
as one of its strongest recruiters.
He will leave Maryland after
three seasons as head coach. The
Terrapins failed to qualify for
the NCAA Tournament in each.
Bakich, who is the youngest
head coach among BCS schools,
expects his youth to help him,
especially onthe recruitingtrail.
"I've been very fortunate to
get an early start to a coaching
career and get opportunities at
a very high level, spending 11
years in the ACC and the SEC,"
Bakich told The Michigan Daily
on Thursday. "And not many
people can say ihey've had those
opportunities."
Prior to Maryland, Bakich
served as an assistant coach
for seven seasons at Vanderbilt,
under esteemed head coach Tim
Corbin. As the hitting coach for
the Commodores, Bakich helped
Vanderbilt rise to prominence,
where it advanced to the NCAA
Tournament five times during
his time in Nashville.
'(Bakich) will transition
well," Corbin said in an exclu-
sive interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. "He fits my image of
what a coach at Michigan is, and
that is a blue-collar personality,
but one that respects the val-
ues of the student-athlete and
understands that academics (are
a) premium, much like they are
here at Vanderbilt."
Known as a tireless recruiter,
Bakich emphasized how much
easier it is to sell a recruit on a
program thathas sound academ-
ics. Bakich agreed with Corbin

that it's

and I

recruit- Eric Bakich is announced a
ing pro- baseball program on May:
cess,"
Bakich said. "And the highlight
of that will be here at Michigan
and with all the tremendous
assets that this university has
academically and athletically.
"Our focus is always going to
be on recruiting. There are some
very good players that are com-
mitted to be here this fall. There
are a few that are committed to
be here the following fall. We're
certainly going to identify those
guys and start a relationship
with them with our new coach-
ing staff immediately."
The new coach stressed that
the Michigan job is quite the
"opportunity" for him and went
on to state his lofty goals for the
program, which has struggled
mightily in recent seasons.
"Being in the ACC and the
SEC, I've been able to see some
of the best programs and the
best teams and how they recruit
and how they build a program
and how they build a team,"
Bakich said. "Coming to the
Big Ten, I.think there's oppor-
tunity to win championships.
And we're certainly going to try

Barnes Arico replaces Kevin Borseth as the ninth head coach of the women's basketball team.
Barnes Arico formally
introduced as nint h ead
women's basketball coach

to use the blueprints of places
that I've had the opportunity
to be in the past, build the pro-
gram, develop our players with
the recruiting and development
approach and bring champion-
ships back to Michigan."
Bakich played collegiately at
East Carolina.
"For us, the focus is always
going to be the process orien-
tated approach on everybody
getting better every single day
and improving, even if it's one
percent, every single day in
striving to reach whatever their
maximum potential is in all
areas of their life," Bakich said.
One member of Bakich's
Maryland staff, pitching coach
Sean Kenny, is an Ann Arbor
native. Though the University's
job board lists an opening for an
assistant coach as well, it hasn't
yet been announced whether
Kenny, witlahis local ties, might
follow Bakich to Michigan. The
Michigan staff already includes
assistant Wayne Welton and
pitching coach Steve Merri-
man.

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
APRIL, 23, 2012 - In a press
conference in the Jack Roth Sta-
dium Club at Michigan Stadium
on Monday, Michigan athletic
director Dave Brandon formally
introduced Kim Barnes Arico
as the ninth head women's bas-
ketball coach in the program's
40-year history.
Barnes Arico replaces Kevin
Borseth, who left the program
on.April 4 to return to Wiscon-
sin-Green Bay. Borseth took the
Wolverines to their first NCAA
Tournament in i1 years, but
they fell to Oklahoma in the first
round.
"Our women's basketball
program has made significant
strides over the past few years,"
Brandon said. "But we have
more to go. The reason you come
to Michigan is to compete for
championships and play at the
highest level. That's what we
want for our women's basketball
program.
"Words cannot express how
pleased and proud that I am
that on Friday, we were able to
announce that Kim Barnes Arico
is going to lead our program."
Barnes Arico arrives in Ann
Arbor after 10 years at the helm
of St. John's, where she took a
bottom-feeder in the Big East to
three consecutive NCAA Tour-
naments. She also became the
winningest women's basketball
coach for the Red Storm on Feb.
12, recording her 169th victory.
In her opening statement,
Barnes Arico expressed her
excitement to join the Michi-

gan family - something she
mentioned was one of the great
things about coming to the
university, in addition to the
welcoming atmosphere in Ann
Arbor.
"One of the things when I
was looking at the University of
Michigan that made it so appeal-
ing to me before I came and
through the process was Dave
Brandon," Barnes Arico said.
"He is a special man, and I found
that out in a short period of time.
I'm thrilled for the opportunity
to work with him here at the
University.
"It's one of the best universi-
ties in the country, academically
and athletically. I'm excited to
be here. I'm expecting great
things."
Though the Wolverines have
made significant progress in the
past few years under Borseth,
they will now have to adapt to
a different style of play. Many
questions surrounding the
transition from the old style to
Barnes Arico's coaching style
were addressed, as well as
Barnes Arico's own switch from
coaching and recruiting in the
Big East to the Big Ten.
Barnes Arico believes she
won't have trouble getting the
team to adapt to her coach-
ing style - she implements a
fast-paced, defensive-minded
system that Michigan began to
run under Borseth and has been
seen in Big Ten teams such as
Penn $tate and Ohio State.
"I think the mindset will
always be defense first," said
senior guard Jenny Ryan. "At St.
John's they played a very fast-

paced game and I think (Barnes
Arico) really prided herself on
defense creating the offense.
I think that'll blend perfectly
with our style."
As for recruiting, Barnes
Arico is excited to welcome the
state's top player, Madison Ris-
tovski, to the team and hopes to
use her ties to the East Coast to
her advantage in recruiting, as
well.
"I definitely think I can
recruit the Midwest, and I think
I have to recruit the Midwest,"
'Barnes Arico said. "I think I can
recruit the East, as well. Michi-
gan is a national name, and peo-
ple from around the country will
come to the University of Michi-
gan."
Michigan finished seventh in
the Big Ten last season with an
8-8 conference record and was
eliminated in the quarterfinals
of the conference tournament.
The Wolverines have a fierce
in-state rivalry with Michigan
State, which has beaten them 19
of the past 20 times.
Michigan has beaten Ohio
State three of the last four times,
but the in-state rivalry, both in
recruiting and on the court, is a
key focus for Barnes Arico's next
season.
"I think it's time," Barnes
Arico said. "I'm really excited
about it. I know (Michigan State
has) a great program and a great
tradition in women's basketball,
but I think we have all of these
things too.
"I don't want to steal from
somebody else, but it's the Uni-
versity of Michigan fergod-'
sakes."

Michigan earns No.11

MARCH 12, 2012 - Finally,

But there are no fairy tales in
wrestling.
Russell had a 3-0 record
against Marion, so he was con-
fident before the match. But it
didn't turn out exactly the way he
planned. Though Russell posted
the first takedown, Marion retali-
ated and kept the score close.
Russell aggressively drove
Marion into the mat while
the Hawkeye tried to earn an
escape. But Marion tied it up in
the middle of the second period.
And after trading escapes, at the
sound of the whistle, Russell was
a single second away from a win
off of riding time.
But 59 seconds was not enough,
and Marion took Russell into sud-
den victory.
"He kind of caught me sleeping
a little bit when he got that take-
down," Russell said. "Going into
overtime, I knew I had the upper
hand."
Again, Russell came out on
top. He took control and brought
Marion down to the mat with 23
seconds left on the clock.
Though his first national title
was an accomplishment in and
of itself, his second-consecutive
crown was just icing on the cake.
Russell's last match as a Wol-
verine finalized his career record
at 134-12 to share the eighth
place on Michigan's all-time win-

Pantaleo (1985-89), Airron Rich-

gram, we need to understand the
opportunity we have as-Team One.
There's going to be a Team 132 in
lacrosse one day, and they're going
to look back and remember the
number of teams that have been
through this."
As a varsity team, the Wolver-
ines will face much stiffer' com-
petition. In light of this, Paul is
taking a long-term approach to
coaching his team.
"We've made it our mission this

year to build an elite Division-
I culture," Paul said. "And that
doesn't necessarily mean that
we're winning every Division-
I game, it means we're building
this culture that's going to lay the
foundation for what this program
is going to become."
Junior Sean Sutton expressed
a similar sentiment about the
turbulent transitional phase.
"We expect the competition to
be a. higher level, obviously," he
said. "But we're going to do what
we can control, and that's get-
ting better each and every day.
We have no expectations of wins
and losses right now. We're just
trying to work to get that culture
established, and trying to set the
culturethat will bring us to a great
program some day."

Paul will need serious com-
mitment from his players mov-
ing forward if the Wolverines
hope to have success. The switch
to Division I places new demands
on his players.
Most of the players of the Mich-
igan lacrosse team didn't sign on
to compete at a varsity level, com-
ing to Michigan with the expec-
tation of playing club lacrosse.
Suddenly, thrust into Division I,
their upcoming season includes
many more responsibilities than-
they're used to handling.
It remains to be seen whether
these new responsibilities will
be fulfilled moving forward. So
far, Paul seems pleased with the
team's development. Last Satur-
day, Michigan participated in an
exhibition match against Divi-

sion-III Denison and came out
with a 12-8 victory.
"We had, a lot of young guys
stepping up," Paul said. "We had
guys playing out of position that
had to step up. From the perspec-
tive of guys stepping up in their
roles today, I thought it went really
well."
Regardless of the team's final
record this year, the season will
be a remarkable one due to its his-
toric nature. For the players, this
represents a dream come true.
"(Being a Division-I athlete)
is surreal," said fifth-year senior
Trevor Yealy. "I would have never
guessed it. When I started here,
I would have never thought that
I'd have the opportunity and the
privilege to do this. It's a privilege,
it's an honor, it's exciting."

The midnight gesture of
goalie Shawn Hunwick

MARCH 24, 2012 - GREEN
BAY, Wisc. - The crease is
empty now.
The custodians in the Resch
Center stands are picking up
trash, and with plastic gloves
they shove Skittles wrappers
and used napkins and programs
that show a picture of a 5-foot-6
goaltender that used to play for
the Michigan hockey team into
a large plastic trash bag.
It is a quarter till midnight.
Below them, on the ice, the
crease is empty.
Forty-nine minutes ago, at
10:56 p.m., it wasn't. Forty-nine.
minutes ago, there was a goal-
tender named Shawn Hunwick
lying on his right side across
that crease, and a puck was
there, just past the crown of his
helmet.'
Hunwick lay there for a
moment then rolled over. He
picked himself up, and for a
fleeting second he stood there
in that crease with his arms
on the cross bar, looking up at
something in the ceiling.
There he was again, three,
years in a row with the same
result. For three years, the final
puck of the season was in his
goal and not in his glove, and
the only difference was that
this time there was no next
year.
So he crouched down and
grabbed that puck and put it in
his glove. For once, he would
skate off with it.
He made toward the benches,
toward his teammates, toward
his friends. They said little.
As they patted him on the
back, he skated on until he
arrived not as his bench, but at
the bench next to it, where he
found a Cornell assistant coach..
For the last time, Hunwick

took the puck out of his glove,
and he handed it to the coach
whose team had just defeated
him. It was their goal, not his,
and he wanted them to have it.
Behind him, workers took
the goal off its moorings and
moved it through the tunnel.
After shaking hands, Hun-
wick skated off past that empty
crease.
Thirty seconds later, and one
time zone away, clocks at Yost
Ice Arena blinked to midnight.
Somehow, Cinderella stayed
at the ball for three mesmeriz-
ing years.
The kid who was too small
to get a chance in goal, got
a chance in goal. The goalie
who wasn't good enough to
start, started. The starter who
wouldn't possibly win, won.
He led Michigan on its mir-
acle run to clinch an NCAA
Tournament berth in 2010, and
then willed it into the National
Championship game the fol-
lowing year.
He was the team's best play-
er all season,but he was more
than that.
"What can you say to Hun-
wick?" said senior forward
Luke Glendening. "He's been
the rock of this team for three
years now. Words can't describe
what you say to him."
Three years' worth of mem-
ories came tumbling toward
Hunwick eight minutes 'into
the overtime period against
Cornell on Friday. Three years
of chance injuries and breaks,
three years of saves, three
years of improbable wins, burst
past Derek DeBlois and Kevin
Lynch.
A lifetime of those who told
him he would never-make a save
for Michigan stared Hunwick
in the face and dared him to
save a Greg Miller wrister.
And, with an outstretched

pad save, he did.
If this really were Cinderel-
la, if this were a fairy tale, that
would be that.
Michigan would ride the
momentum of that great save to
a season-saving overtime win.
But this isn't a fairy tale and
there are no happily ever afters,
even for Shawn Hunwick. This
is college hockey, and this is
single-elimination, and the
players? Humans.
So that wasn't that, Michigan
didn't go down and score, and
Hunwick didn't get the ring.
"Shawn Hunwick here has
had a Cinderella year," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"I wish he could've had a better
ending."
And the ending? All-too-
human: Hunwick couldn't con-
trol the rebound, Rodger Craig
put the puck into the open net,
and at 10:56 on a rainy night
in Green Bay, Wisc., the career
of the most improbable goalie
in Michigan hockey history
ended.
Losing. the battle against
tears, Shawn Hunwick passes
Cornell coach Mike Schafer at
12:23 a.m.
Schafer was walking to the
podium to speak to the media.
Hunwick was walking out.
"One of the classiest things
I've seen in 25 years of coach-
ing," Schafer would say of Hun-
wick's gesture to Cornell after
the game.
Outside, in a concrete hall-
way, a man whose Cornell tie
matches Hunwick's eyes taps
the former Michigan goalie on
the shoulder and shakes his
hand.
Hunwick turns to his right
toward his locker room. He
stops, then turns back and calls
out:
"Good luck tomorrow."
You too, Shawn.

FEB. 9, 2012 - In the midst
of college football's bowl season
and winter break, a professional
hockey game at the Big House
will bring life to the University's
campus on Jan. 1, 2013.
During a rare Wednesday
morning meeting, the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents met in
a special session to discuss and
approve the National Hockey
League's lease of Michigan Sta-
dium for its Winter Classic - the
league's annual outdoor hockey
game.
The NHL will pay the Uni-
versity $3 million to rent the Big
House and will use the stadium
from Dec. 1, 2012 to mid-January,
according to a communication to
the regents from Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon and Timothy
Slottow, the University's execu-
tive vice president and chief
financial officer. The Winter
Classic game will take place on
Jan. 1, 2013 and has an alternate
date of Jan. 2, 2013.
During the meeting, Bran-
don said the NHL is expected to
donate a "significant" amount to
student scholarships at the Uni-
versity from its charitable foun-
dation.
According to Brandon, the
NHL approached the University
last November, and since then,
discussions about the event have
been underway. Brandon said in
an interview after the meeting
that he expects the contract to be
finalized soon.
Brandon emphasized that the
event is not University spon-
sored, which means no student
tickets will be made available.
"We're not in the business of
marketing this event, we're not
in charge of the sponsors. This is
all going to be the NHL," Bran-
don said. "The NHL is really tak-
ing over the stadium for that day,
and they're marketing the spaces
in whatever manner they feel
appropriate."
The University will use one
of its 12 available one-day-only

liquorlicenses on the event. Beer
typically isn't sold at Michigan
Stadium during Michigan foot-
ball games. According to the
communication, the usual con-
cessionaire for foolball games,
Sodexo, Inc., is expected to pro-
vide concessions and staff at the
game.
This will be the second time
in the last three years for the Big
House to hold a hockey game.
Michigan and Michigan State
played in the Big Chill at the
Big House in 2010, breaking the
world record for attendance to a
hockey game. Brandon said the
NHL is "hell-bent" on break-
ing the record set during the Big
Chill of 104,173 attendees.
Brandon said he expects the
event to draw in excess of $14
million in economic activity to
Ann Arbor. Newman added that
the .economic boost is one of the
key reasons the regents approved
the lease.
"One of the factors that we
discussed when considering this
was the economic value to the
city of Ann Arbor and the sur-
rounding community and the
goodness this would do for res-
taurants and hotels and shops
and other activity in the area,"
Newman said. "I think that at a
time of year where it's otherwise
quiet, doing something like this
makes a lot of sense."
Speaking at the start of the
meeting, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said it was
important to discuss the lease
with the board before making
made a final decision.
"Since this is an unusual and
highly visible use of the facil-
ity, we thought it prudent for the
board to discuss the proposed
arrangement and ... vote on
authorization to proceed," Cole-
man said during the opening of
the session.
- Six of the eight regents -
Denise Ilitch (D-Bingham
Farms), Katherine White (D-Ann
Arbor), Andrea Fischer Newman
(R-Ann Arbor), Andrew Richner
(R-Grosse Point), S. Martin Tay-
lor (D-Grosse Point Farms) and
Laurence Deitch (D-Bingham
Farms) - participated in the

meeting via phone. Five of the
six approved the plan as Ilitch
recused herself from the vote
because of her affiliation with the
Red Wings - she is the daughter
of Mike Ilitch, the owner of the
Red Wings, Detroit-Tigers and
Comerica Park.
"While I have no direct inter-
est in the National Hockey
League, it is well known that
my family has an interest in the
Detroit Red Wings Hockey Club
and Comerica Park," Ilitch said.
"It is important to me to avoid
any appearance of conflict in this
matter."
The Detroit Red Wings and
the Toronto Maple Leafs are the
two teams expected to play in
the contest.

Insomnia Cookies
leases space on
South University

I KKMOLENutF/Daily

Borders Bookstore on East Liberty Street sees its final day on September 9, 2011. The company was founded in Ann Arbor in 1971.
A2 landmark, Liberty St.
Borders to close today

After more than a
year missing from
campus, the late
night treat returns
ByK.C.WASSMAN
Daily Staff Reporter '
APRIL 2, 2012 The cookie
crumbs of Insomnia cookies
will soon increase in Ann Arbor
as the company is returning
to Ann Arbor after a hiatus of
more than a year.
Popular cookie vendor
Insomnia Cookies signed a
lease last month to move into
the space formerly occupied by
Yogo Bliss on South University
Avenue.
Since Insomnia Cookies
ceased all Ann Arbor opera-
tions in January 2011, students
have had to rely on Stucchi's
on South University Avenue as
the sole location to satiate an
Insomnia Cookie craving. The
company previously operated
its business out of a food truck
until a change in Ann Arbor's
Solicitors and Peddlers ordi-
nance forbade food trucks from
parking and selling food "on a
street or other public property
.. for longer than 5 minutes
within a 2 hour period unless
issued a street use permit for
that location."
Seth Berkowitz, CEO and
founder of Insomnia Cookies,
said he believes the store will be
as successful as the truck was.
"We know from our experi-
ence that the store willbe a wel-
come place," Berkowitz said.

"There'sgoingtobe alotofseats
for people to hang out. It will be
warm; it will be indoors and
will have all the things that our
other stores do, so we expect it
to be very successful."
Berkowitz said Insomnia 0
Cookies is renovating the inside
of the space in order to fit the
company look. However, the city
posted a "Stop Work Order" on
the front of the company's new
location on Sunday, noting that
it lacked the proper permits for
any construction work in the
space.
In a statement to the Daily
yesterday, Lisha Turner-Tolbert,
general permit manager for the
city ofAnn Arbor, said Insomnia
Cookies has since applied for the
appropriate permits and had the
space inspected.
Mike Giraud, vice presi-
dent of Swisher Commercial,
the realty company that owns
the property, said he expects
Insomnia Cookies to be suc-
cessful at the South University
location.
"I think they'll do phenom-
enally," Giraud said. "It's a
tested product. They've got ,a
good'location. They know their
demographic and they've got a
great business plan."
Giraud could not be reached
for an additional interview to
provide comment on the "Stop
Work Order" notice.
Engineering senior Divya
Kondapalli. said she's glad that
Insomnia Cookies will soon
have its own store.
"I love Insomnia Cookies,"
Kondapalli said. "They're good
for a late night snack. They're
just warm and gooey."

Future of company
still unknown
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
SEPT. 9, 2011 - Ann Arbor-
based Borders Group Inc. said
it will close its flagship location
at 612 East Liberty St. today, six
weeks after announcing it would
liquidate its 399 stores and all of
its assets.
But even as the chain liquidates
stores nationwide and clears
stock at discount rates as high
as 90 percent, Borders's future
remains uncertain. An auction
of the group's intellectual prop-
erty - incltsOing its brand name,
website and customer loyalty
program -is set for Sept. 14. This
leaves t ssibilitythat Borders
could cue as an online book-
seller, the now online-only
electron s retailer Circuit City.
It is &1ear if Borders, which
announe its liquidation on
July 1 Nsreceived any bids

for its intellectual property. The
bids were due Sept. 8, according
to Borders spokeswoman Mary
Davis. However, she wrote in an
e-mail interviewto The Michigan
Daily that she would not com-
ment further until the informa-
tion is ready to be made to the
public.
As it nears the end of its liq-
uidation process, Borders is also
entangled in a pair of legal battles
with former employees and busi-
ness partners. Davis declined
to comment on the status of the
ongoing lawsuits.
Business seemed as usual at
the East Liberty Street Borders
location on Friday. Discounts
rose to as high as 90 percent,
and signs announced that even
the store furniture is for sale.
Employees hung posters broad-
casting the deals and fielded
questions from customers who
were confused that the business
section had been reduced to a
single bookshelf with no system
of organization.
Customers and passersby had

mixed reactions to the store's
closing. Dozens of pedestrians
along East Liberty, taking notice
of the signs advertising the
markdowns, wandered into the
store hopingto find a steal-
Matt Newman, a Rackham
student studying classics, said he
came into the store looking for
two children's books he had read
when he was younger, but after
browsing through a children's
section in disarray and dismiss-
ing the "strange-looking young
adult fiction" that was on display
throughout the store, he left a few
minutes later.
"I don't think there was any
real rhyme or reason to the way
things were going in there now,"
Newman said.
While Newman and others
streaming into the store returned
empty-handed, sometimes
after only a few minutes, oth-
ers emerged carrying as many as
three or four plastic bags filled
with books, music and movies.
Bill Auernhamer, a long-time
Ann Arbor resident, purchased

two hardcover books from the
store for a total of $1.70 in what
he said was his fourth ,or fifth
visit to the store since Borders
announced its liquidation. Had
discounts not been so steep, he
said, he might not have purchased
anything from a selection of
books that had been "pretty well-
picked over by now."
"You wouldn't want to go in
there looking for a specific book
- you probably wouldn't find it,"
Auernhamer said. "But if you're
looking for something that might
be interesting, at a good price, you
might still go in there and find
something."
Borders was founded in Ann
Arbor in 1971 by Tom and Louis
Borders.
Auernhamer, an avid reader
since he retired, said he is "sad"
to see Borders close.
"I've been coming in and out
of this store forI don't know how
long. I remember when this store
was on State Street," he said. "I
can never remember feeling so
sad over a'store closing."

Area sees decreased
sales since Borders
closed last fall
ByDANIELLESTOPPELMAN
Daily StaffReporter
JAN. 25, 2012 - Sole Sisters, a
boutique on East Liberty Street,
will be closing its doors at the
end of the month - joining the
growinglistof businesses in the
area that have ceased operating
in the past few months, includ-
ing Poshh, This and That, @
Burger and Borders.
According -to local business
owners and Tim Faley, manag-
ing director of the Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies in the
Ross School of Business, the
rise in store closures in the area
could be related to a variety of
factors, including the closure
of Borders in September and
increased competition from
upscale restaurants that have
began to flourish in the area.
Tamar Fowler, owner of Sole
Sisters, said the company expe-
rienced a decrease in sales over
the course of the past six to eight
months that has made continu-
ing business operations diffi-
cult. Though she moved to East
Liberty from Fourth Avenue in
2010 in hopes of increased foot
traffic, ultimately she said the
rent on East Liberty was too
high.
"It's heartbreaking, of
course," Fowler said. "You put
so much time and effort into it...
it does hurt a little, but it's still
good because I've tried ... we
made it three and a half years. I
met some really great people; I
love my customers, I really got
to know each and every one of
them."
Sole Sisters, which opened
in March 2010, will hopefully
be revived in the future as she
explores methods of reviving
her business and new ways to
sell her shoes, handbags and
jewelry, Fowler said.
Faley wrote, in an e-mail
interview that in order for busi-
nesses to remain open, they
must accrue greater revenue
than the costs paid to operate
the store, noting that many df
the businesses that have been

successful in the area are high-
er-end restaurants that serve
liquor to supplement food prof-
its.
"While restaurants and retail
shops all operate on thin mar-
gins, the bottom line is that a
higher-end restaurant with a
liquor license - if it they can
attract a, consistent stream of
customers - are advantaged
and can support a higher rent
than small retail shop or fast-
food restaurant," Faley said.
Faley added that downtown
Ann Arbor development asso-
ciates prefer a wide variety of
storefronts, mixing retail, res-
taurants and other specialty
shops. However, he said main-
taining this diversity has been
challenging as niche stores
close due to low profits and high
rent.
"It will be interesting to see
how far the mix along the Lib-
erty Street corridor will ulti-
mately swing," Faley said.
In order to decrease the
expense of maintaining a store-
front, Fowler plans to display
her merchandise at private
parties and events, as well as
develop a website for online
shopping.
"I feel good about it... closing
these doors is just going to open
up more," Fowler said.
However, other storeown-
ers on East Liberty said they
don't feel as optimistic about
the future of their businesses.
Angela'Eddins, owner of Rocky
Mountain Chocolate Factory,
said she is concerned about the
high rent and low foot traffic,
attributing decreased sales to
a number of factors, includ-
ing the closing of Borders - a
major draw for customers to
the area.
"Borders's closing has killed
all of us," Eddins said. "We've
been open for years and we can
see our sales from when Bor-
ders was open to when it closes,
and it's downhill."
Eddins said many customers
may also vieW the East Liberty
strip as unappealing due to the
high number of panhandlers,
adding that very few customers
visit her store.
"It's dead oow ... It's like a
ghost town od there," Eddins
said.

AirRide bus service begins

Route will serve
Detroit Metro
starting April 2
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
APRIL 2, 2012 - With sum-
mer quickly approaching, stu-
dents may now have an easier
time finding their way home at
the end of the semester with the
assistance of AirRide - a newly
launched service that provides
daily roundtrip bus transporta-
tion from the Ann Arbor area to
the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne
County Airport.
The program - a collabo-
ration with Michigan Flyer,
a branch of the Indian Trails
Motor Coach transportation ser-
vice - will stop 12 times daily at
the Blake Transit Center and the
Kensington Court Hotel, located
off of State Street, as well as four
times at the University's Central
Campus Transit Center. Tickets
range from $6 to $20,a person,
depending on age and how far in
advance a ticket is purchased.
At the official announcement
of the service at the Kensington
Court Hotel on Friday, David
Nacht, a Law School alum and
AATA board member who spear-
headed AirRide's development,
lauded the service's affordability
and consistency of service to the
crowd of about 40 people.
"This is a big deal," he said.
"You're not going to wait two or
three hours. You need regular
services, and you need to know
that ad rely on that. We're
offering that."
Nacht said demand from
University officials was an
important factor in the service's
introduction, noting that he
surveyed the deans of the Uni-

versity's schools and colleges to
find out the biggest barrier to
attracting prospective faculty
and graduate students.
"Number one or two on every
dean's list were transportation
issues," he said. "The University
is the number one driver of traf-
fic to and from our community
from this airport, and so, this
is very much designed with the
University in mind."
Under current plans for the
service, AirRide may offer air-
port-bound riders parking for up
to 14 days at the Fourth Avenue
and East William Street parking
structure and at the Kensington
Court Hotel for $2 per day. It,
would also potentially share bus
stops with the Detroit SMART
bus system.
While the buses will stop
more frequently at the two off-
campus stops than they will at
the Central Campus Transpor-
tation Center, AATA officials
said they expect University stu-
dents to take advantage of the
service.
AATA board chairman Jesse
Bernstein said the service could
be a "perfect opportunity" for
students' parents to shuttle'
between Ann Arbor and the air-
port, adding that AirRide came
to fruition partly from the Uni-
versity's encouragement of the
plan to service their faculty and
staff.
"They're very supportive,
because they want to get their
people to the airport back and
forth cheaply and efficiently,"
Bernstein said. "They've been
very cooperative."
A variety of political fig-
ures were also present at the
announcement, including U.S.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
state Reps. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) and Rick Olson (R-York
Township) and Ann Arbor

Mayor John Hieftje.
Dingell said the cooperation
between the parties involved in
AirRide is a contrast from the
polarized climate in Washing-
ton, D.C.
"This is just one example
of how this community works
together," Dingell said. "I wish,
perhaps, as I come back from
Washington, I could come and
say that Congress is doing as
well."
Olson added thatirRide is
an important addition to the
city, noting that it serves as ful-
filling a "missing link."
"(In) every other city in this
county, when you wantto get to
downtown or wherever, there
are alternate ways of getting
there,"'Olson said. "Ann Arbor
doesn't have that other than a
cab, and that's a costy way, and
it's also not an energy efficient
way. Ann Arbor and Detroit -
it's an anomaly when it comes
to major cities in the United
States."
Kirk Steudle, director of the
state's department of trans-
portation and an attendee of
Friday's announcement, also
praised the service for its fulfill-
ment of Republican Gov. Sny-
der's transportation message
this fall.
In an interview in September,
AATA spokeswoman Mary Sta-
siak said the proposed service
was not intended to compete
with AirBus, an airport shuttle
sponsored by the Central Stu-
dent Government that runs
during breaks for University
students.
"(AirBus) service plays a very,
very important role when there
are a tremendous amountof pas-
sengers traveling between. the
airport and Ann Arbor at really
high-peak periods, and we don't
see ourselves replacing that at

Tornado slams Dexter

Ann Arbor spared
as campus takes.
cover from storm
By ZACH BERGSON and
ANNA ROZENBERG and
ADAM RUBENFIRE
Online Editor, Daily Staff Reporter
ad Darly News Editor
MARCH 15, 2012 - DEXTER,
Mich. - As a result of a storm
that brought significant rain,
severe hail and gusting winds to
campus yesterday, several Uni-
versity buildings sustained dam-
age, while a tornado ravaged
the nearby towns of Dexter and
Pinckney.
No casualties or injuries were
reported by the Washtenaw
* County Emergency Management
agency as of 11 p.m. yesterday.
However, at the University, sig-
nificant leaking was observed
in the center hallway connect-
ing Mason and Angell Halls. At
the intersection of South State
and Arch Streets, about 2 feet
of standing water slowed cars
traveling near South Campus,
and water reached the hoods of
parked cars in front of the Ste-
phen M. Ross Academic Center
and the Athletic Ticket Office.
A tornado warning for Washt-
enaw County was issued after 5
p.m. yesterday evening, and the
University's Emergency Alert
system was activated, sending
text, e-mail and voice messages
to students, faculty and staff. The
system sent students four mes-
sages regarding the initial tor-
nado warning, an extension of
the warning, spotting of funnel
clouds and tornados, and finally
the expiration of the warning
and a subsequent thunderstorm
watch and flood warning.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown
said she did not have any details
regarding the leaks in Angell
Hall, but said there was "appar-
ent water" inside the Ross Aca-
demic Center.
University of Michigan
Health System spokesman Ian
Demsky said there was a small
leak in a stairwell in the Com-
prehensive Cancer Center and
that precautions were taken
to protect patients depending
on their condition and their
location in the hospital. He
said blinds were closed, some,
patients were moved into hall-
ways and other interior spaces,
and blankets were placed over
several patients to protect them
in case of shatterin glass from a
tornado impact.
Brown said the typical
response to a tornado warning
depends on the amount and type
of calls DPS receives. For exam-
ple, Brown said if there is a power
outage on campus, police officers
are often required to respond to
calls of individuals stuck in eleva-
tors.
Still, if severe weather is
reported close to the University,
Brown said officers will take
necessary precautions to protect
themselves.
"If it's really coming to cam-
pus, thenthey've got to take cover
for themselves," Brown said.
Ann Arbor Police, Housing
Security, and hlospital Security -

could all be heard over police
radio yesterday afternoon per-
forming checks to ensure that
University buildings took neces-
sary precautions to protect stu-
dents, staff and faculty.
LSA senior Courtney Fletcher
said she had been stuck in Angell
Hall for more than three and a
half hours waiting for the worst
of the weather to pass.
While the weather may have
interfered with her day, Fletcher
was not bothered studying in the
hallways alongside the leaks.
"I mean it needs to be fixed,
but now they know what's going
on so hopefully they fix it as soon
as possible," Fletcher said. "I'm
not worried aboutcanythinggoing
wrong. It's leaking but most
buildings leak."
Because of the inclement
weather, Central Student Gov-
ernment had to cancel its presi-
dential and vice presidential
debates that were scheduled for
yesterday evening.
CSG President DeAndree Wat-
son, who was
taking shelter
from the storm
in the Michigan
Union, said time
spent taking
shelter from the
storm allowed
him to get some
work done.
Watson said
conditions at
Angell Hall as
a result of the
storm are not fit
for students at
the University.
"We get heavy rainfall, we
start leaking and use trash cans
at the University of Michigan
- I don't think that's accept
able," Watson said. "We're going
to push hard to make sure we
improve our facilities."
A tornado that spurred
from the storm damaged and
destroyed several homes in near-
by Dexter and Pinckney in north-
west Michigan.
Dexter resident Victor Hola,
a nurse at the UMHS Cancer
Center, said the roof and garage
of his home near Hudson Mills
Metropolitan Park were torn
apart by the tornado. He said he
didn't suffer any injuries, but was
driving home when the tornado
touched down in his neighbor-
hood.
Scott Ferguson, Hola's partner,
said he did not hear any tornado
sirens go off when the tornado
warning was issued because his
neighborhood - located about
five miles away from the Village
of Dexter - does not have an
alert system. However, Ferguson
said he heard the warning over
National Public Radio broadcasts
and quickly took shelter in the
basement with his dog and cat.
Though he sustained no physi-
cal injuries, Ferguson said the
tornado ripping through his
home was a terrifying experi-
ence.
"I've never been so scared in
my entire life," he said. "Think of
ten freight trains coming at you
all at once and you can't move
that's what (the tornado) was
like."
Hola added that his neighbor's
garage and roof were also torn
off during the storm. The first

responders in the neighborhood
worked to remove fallen trees
and repair down power lines that
littered the streets.
In an e-mail interview yester-
day, Perry Samson, a professor of
atmospheric, oceanic and space
sciences, wrote that yesterday's
storms came as a "surprise" to
him so early in the year.
"Usually this time of year
we're worried about ice storms
and/or episodes of dense fog,"
Samson wrote. "This warm
weather is remarkable."
Samson wrote that the cause
for the storm isn't clear, as it
could be the result of several fac-
tors.
"No scientist worth their
salt will say this is due to global
warming because we know the
only thing normal about weather
is that it's rarely normal," Sam-

Puppets to parade through
downtown in upcoming
FestiFools celebration

Runners begin first round of the Ann Arbor marathon at Michigan Stadium at 6:45 a.m.
F irst ever Ann Arbor
Marathon escapes weather

'U' students make,
share their puppet
creations with A2
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Arts Writer
MARCH 30, 2012 - Looking
for a particularly foolish way to
spend the first of April this year,
but tired of the same old pranks
and tricks? The sixth annual
FestiFools will offer an artistic
experience for April Fool's Day
enthusiasts.
In 2006, Mark Tucker, the
arts director for the Lloyd Hall
Scholars Program, decided to
take the idea of street theater
to the next level for University
students. As part of his Art in
Public Spaces course, Tucker
had his students create giant
paper-mach6 puppets to assist a
local theater production.
Six years later, this foray
into student puppeteering has
become one of the most talked-
about events in Ann Arbor.
Tucker wrote in an e-mail.
interview that FestiFools is a
non-profit public art perfor-
mance unrestrained by a tradi-
tional theater, sponsored by the
University, City of Ann Arbor
and civic, corporate and private
donors.
"Ultimately, we're exposing a
broad spectrum of people to this
entertaining brand of public art
as a vehicle for celebrating and
supporting creativity and visual
literacy," Tucker wrote.
While the actual parade will
take place on Sunday, FestiFools
isn't merely a one-act show.
Prom dusk to midnight tomor-
row, mischief-makers eager to
get an early start on festivities
can attend FoolMoon, a proces-

sion of handmade, illuminated
sculptures throughout the
streets of Ann Arbor.
Besides viewing the sculp-
ture procession, attendees will
have the opportunity to witness
street-sized shadow-puppet
performances, experimental
silent films and other surprises.
In addition, Tucker wrote
that Spontaneous Art, a perfor-
mance art collective, will create
live video games for festival-
goers.
"They will be dressed in
robot suits and provide chal-
lenges similar to obstacle
courses or light sports," Tucker
wrote. "Players will have to
dodge, jump, duck, aim, throw
and step quicklyto make it to
the next level."
Art & Design Prof. NickTobi-
er, whose students produce the
puppets for FestiFools, said he
can't wait for the students to
march down Main Street with
their creations.
"You know, as we round the
corner and enter, I'm just look-
ing forward to seeing the looks
(in) their eyes," Tobier said. "It's
great to be part of some event in
which you're both part of Ann
Arbor and part of the Univer-
sity. I think that happens all too
rarely."
Art & Design freshman Kelly
Sadlon, one of the students
involved in the parade, said she
can't wait to see the reactions
of the children in the audience
when they catch a glimpse of
the puppets.
"Events like this bring atten-
tion not only to Ann Arbor, but
to the art school and art itself,"
Sadlon said. "It's parades like
these that make children and
adults aware of art who may not
typically be exposed to art in
their everyday lives."

Highfield said.
Standing on the corner of
East Madison and State streets,
Northville resident Sarah Hen-
dricks waited to cheer on Rack-
ham student Clarissa Freeman,
who ran the half marathon after
suffering from prolonged paraly-
sis due to a debilitating condition
called spina bifida while in high
school.
"She has a medical condition,
and she had a relapse and wasn't
able to walk or take care of her-
self," Hendricks said. "She's
been working really hard and
training, so it's pretty much a
miracle."
Hendricks explained Free-
man's relapse occurred 18
months beforethe marathon and
while her time was well done for
a first-time runner, she knows
Freeman can improve.
"For a (first) race, there's
always a learning curve for both
participants and the organizers,
so you (can) always learn," Hen-
dricks said.
Before the marathon, sup-
porters of an Immaculate Heart

Julia, who was- running the full
marathon, stood by the starting
line.

ter from Monroe, said Julia was

outreach blog called A Nun's Life
Ministry.
"We have Julia running the
marathon," Kollasch said. "She's
been training faithfully, and
she's really excited about this."
She added that they were
happy to provide Julia with a
much-needed energy boost after
she completed the marathon.
"We're here to support her
and give her coffee at the end of
it all," Kollasch said.
Team Red, White & Blue,
an Ann Arbor-based nonprofit
group for wounded veterans,
had members running in the full
marathon, half marathon and
SK, including Johnny Algor, a

recent law and business gradu-
ate and military veteran.
Before he ran the 5K, Algor
said his foundation fundraised
in support of the event, which
he added is one of many events.
his organization participates in
to promote wounded veterans'
well-being..
"We try to reintegrate wound-
ed veterans back into society,
and one of the ways we try to
get them out is through physical
fitness," Algor said. "That's also
how we build awareness."
Algor said his organization
was able to come together for
the marathon and bond with a
dinner at Conor O'Neill's the
night before as well as a tailgate
planned for after the event.
Algor said he was excited to
run by the places where he stud-
ied for years.
"We'll get to see some of the
sights, I'm excited for it," Algor
said.
Ann Arbor residents Chris-
topher and Carolyn Todd sat in
chairs on the corner of Hill and
State streets to cheer on their
son Kevin and friend Josh, who
traveled from their respective
homes in Boston and Miami to
run.
Carolyn Todd said the mara-
thon did not count as a qualifier
for the esteemed Boston Mara-
thon, something she said would
have drawn in more competitive
runners.
"This is not a qualifying event,
which is not disappointing, but
that means it's not (the) highest
caliber - but it's their first (mar-
athon)," Todd said.
The Todds said it was nice
that the event was in their home-
town because this was their first
time getting to see their son run
a marathon, even though he has
run many and qualified for the
Boston Marathon this year.
Christopher Todd said if they
had a gripe about the marathon,
it would be at their struggle to
find parking.
"We were planning on park-
ing at Yost, but there's no way of
getting in there," Todd said.

* Babo: a market b sava fuses food,
aesthetics and communit in design

New market opens
* Jan. 7 on corner of
Washington and
Division streets
By HALEY GOLDBERG
DailyArts Writer
DEC. 7, 2011 - Walking into
babo: a market by sava, it's easy to
forget the fluorescently lit, bar-
ren grocery stores of shopping
trips past.
Glowing light bulbs hang
from the ceiling, and industrial
metal appliances meld with the
antiquated wood furniture and
decor arranged on the twalls.
Full-length windows feature the
corner of Washington and Divi-
sion streets as the backdrop for
the market, creating a blend of
city life and rustic charm. The
exposed high ceilings through-
out the market yearn to be filled
with the sweet smells of freshly
baked bread and delicacies. Babo
is a place where food meets art,
and grocery shopping transforms
from an errand to an experience.
The aesthetic appearance of
the market, which opens today,
even applies to the products. Paul
Hannah, general manager of the
market, said babo selects quality
products whose labels play to the
design of the market.
"We want the store to kind of
havt a sexy feel to it," Hannah
said. "We want people to walk in
and want to buy everything that
they see."
Along with retail food prod-
ucts, the market will also offer
prepared foods, baked goods,
meats and cheeses sliced to order,
coffee and fresh produce, accord-
ing to babo owner and operator
Sava Lelcaj, who owns Sava's
Restaurant on State Street.
Hannah, who previously
worked as the wine director at
Vinology on Main Street and was
an employee of Zingerman's Deli-
catessen, stressed the mission of
the market isn't simply to provide
food to customers, but to provide
a culinary experience.
"We want to sell food that

Carolyn Todd said the mara-
thon turned out great, but added
that she presumed drivers were
probably a little irked about the
closed streets.
"Locals are not happy about
the traffic situation," she said.
Kinesiology senior Ian Pro-
chaska and his twin brother
Zachary tied as winners of the
5K, both running times of 16:59.
Prochaska said he found the
course easy to follow.
"There were maps online,
so those were nice, so I had a
little bit of a look (at) the course
before I showed up, and then
since my brother and I were out
front, there was a lead vehicle,"
he said. "So I just followed (the

enhances people's lives - not
only the people who consume it
but also the people who make it,"
Hannah said. "All these products
have histories and stories, and
there's a romance to them and we
want people to know that."
Cards placed in front of each
item in the store will detail why a
product was selected for the mar-
ket and what the item is, Hannah
explained. The cards will fea-
ture the signature script of Dave
Lafave, the local artist respon-
sible for the design of babo.
Lafave, who previously worked
at Selo/Shevel Gallery on Main
Street, employs only repurposed
goods in his chic, rustic designs
and shops locally at reclamation
centers in Detroit.
"Everything that I find liter-
ally comes out of the garbage,"
Lafave said. "I clean it up, brush
it down, sand it, paint it white,
paint it some crazy color and
implement (the item) somehow
into the layout of the store."
Lafave will also paint and
decorate the full-length window
displays in babo every 30 days to
represent a seasonal theme or the
introduction of a new product in
the market - currently, a holi-
day theme graces its panes. He
said he plansto keep the market's
appearance as fresh on the out-
side as the products within.
"Sometimes a window might
sort of speak to the color or shape
of the package a product comes
in or if the product adds itself to
a theme," Lafave said. "We never
want to go stale with our visual
image on the street."
Lelaj said Lefave's knack for
reusing and repurposing has
extended to the rest of the mar-
ket, from appliances to the fur-
niture. Wood, which softens the
industrial look throughout the
store, was restored from a barn
that burned down.
"Everything is repurposed,
and we found really creative peo-
ple to help build out the space,"
Lelcaj said. "We've been consci-
entious of our carbon footprint
when working with the space and
selecting Energy Star equipment
and reusing and repurposing as
many things as possible."

Energy-efficient equipment
will be used to create prepared
foods, which patrons can eat at
babo, take to go or order through
a catering service, Hannah said.
Lelcaj added the dishes, made in
house by chefs in an open kitch-
en, will vary depending on the
food in season and will include
mostly ingredients from the mar-
ket itself ina diverse way.
Chefs will join customers in
the market as they select prod-
ucts to include in dishes, Lelcaj
said. Customers will also receive
recipe cards with their dishes,
allowing patrons to return to the
market and buy the ingredients
to make their own rendition of a
babo meal.
Customers can dine in at a
community high-top table, which
also stems from Lafave's inte-
gration of repurposed goods in
the market. The table, which
seats 20 people, is made of two
125-year-old refurbished doors
found at the Reclamation Cen-
ter in Detroit. Inspired by the
markets of London and other big
cities, Hannah said he hopes the
communal table will help bring
patrons together in their experi-
ences at babo.
"You're goingto be eating with
people you don't know, breaking
bread and sharing wine," Han-
nah said. "And I think that's the
fun part"
Patrons canbreakbread inbabo
seven days a week from 7 a.m. to
10 p.m., and the market will serve
prepared breakfast, lunch and
dinner, according to Lelcaj. A beer
and wine department will also be
available after the market secures
a liquor license.
While the food and experience
babo will offer are distinctive,
Hannah said the true character
of babo lies in the face of the mar-
ket - the full-length windows
looking out onto Washington
Street.
"I think when it's all said and
done, the most unique thing
about the market are these win-
dows," Hannah said. "Most times
you walk into a market and you
walk from sunshine into a dark
place that's fluorescent lighting,
and here, it's part of the street."

In a phone interview fast

Mike Anglin - who beat
Republican Stuart Berry with
79.59 percent of the vote in

at his watch party at Old Town

that facing opposition forced a
more thorough examination of

"I was glad that I had an

increased, and with different

Berry could not be reached

All three of the city's ballot
proposals were passed by more
than 50 percent of the vote.
The passage, of. Proposal 1
will replace a current tax that
funds street reconstruction
between 2012 and 2016. The
proposal is expected to raise
more than $9 million in its first
year. Proposal 2 adds another
tax to Proposal 1 that will go
toward sidewalk improvement
and is expected to generate an
additional $563,000 within a
year. Its passage also trans-
fers responsibility for sidewalk
maintenance from homeown-
ers to the city.
With the passage of Proposal

For Karleigh Kroll, a student
in the School of Education, the
race was an opportunity -to
run with friends.
"I have been wanting to
run a 10K, and a bunch of my
friends were running it and I
thought it'd be fun," she said.
Though Kroll has been
casually running for two
years, this was her first race
and she didn't train much for
it.
"I pretty much just got up
and ran," she said.
Despite it being her first
race, Kroll said she really
enjoyed it and finished with a
time of about one hour.
"It was a lot of fun. If this is

them over and over again," she
said.

Prochaska said the scheduling

from running one of the longer

ciate at Allure Boutique, also
said she has noticed decreased
business inthe area, particular-
ly on weekdays, since the recent
closure of nearby stores.
"I think it definitely has a
lot to do with the economy and
also ... Poshh closed ... so that's
affected our business a little
bit, because not as many people
even come down this road to
shop," Kuzon said. "I'd saybusi-
ness is struggling."
