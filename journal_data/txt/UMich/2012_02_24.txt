'U' experts say
Michigan crucial
stop in race for GOP
nomination
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Nearly two months ago, former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney
and former Pennsylvania Sen.
Rick Santorum swapped single-
digit leads in the voting polls
among Iowa caucus-goers before
Romney thought he clenched a
slim victory in the Iowa caucuses,
but a recount later revealed that
Santorum really won.
The two Republican presiden-
tial candidate hopefuls are neck
and neck once more, with recent
poll numbers indicating fluctuat-
ing support for the two frontrun-
ners leading into the upcoming
Michigan primary on. University
professors said the matchup in
Romney's home state could mark

a critical turning point in the race
to become the Republican presi-
dential nominee.
A poll released Sunday by Public
Policy Polling, showed Santorum
holding
a narrow
lead over
Romney .
with 37 to
33 percent
among
Michigan
voters.
Political Science Prof. Vincent
Hutchings said if Romney loses
the primary in Michigan, where
his father served as governor in the
1960s as well as former president
of American Motors, Santorum
could gain critical momentum.
"There was a strong expecta-
tion that Michigan was Romney
territory, so if he were to lose that,
would be a signal that he's really
in trouble," he said.
Hutchings said Romney has
failed to connect with more con-
servative Republican voters. How-

By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
As part of an effort to raise aware-
ness about the oppression and the
unfair treatment of students of the
Baha'i faith in Iran, the University's
Bahu'i Club is hoping to educate
campus about the struggle of certain
Iranian youth in obtaining a quality
education.
Rackham student Basir Van de
Fliert, the club's secretary and
treasurer, said the group's goal is
to promote awareness about Baha'i
students in Iran who are persecuted
for their faith and are prohibited
from attending universities in the
country. He said Baha'i followers
have had to develop other ways for

fficial says ASTUDENTS
Offcia sas rgentine train Fo

accident was preventable

Organization
failed safety tests,
corruption was
ignored for years
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) - Argentina's deadliest train
accident in decades was foresee-
able and preventable, the nation's
auditor general complained yes-
terday, saying years of failed safe-
ty tests and other problems had
given the government more than
enough reason to cancel the train
operator's concession.
Others pointed to high-level
corruption: years-old allegations
still awaiting trial that a former
transportation secretarytook free
vacations and other gifts from
executives of the Trains of Bue-
nos Aires company in exchange
for favorable treatment.
The TBA blamed government
price controls, saying that keep-
ing fares to less than 25 cents a
ride made it impossible to finance
improvements.
Rail safety experts, mean-
while, said modern trains are
built to withstand the kind of
hard stop that killed 50 passen-
gers and injured more than 700
Wednesday.
Newer cars resist the accor-
dion-like crumpling that shoved
hundreds into a jumbled mass
of limbs, metal and blood in the
first two cars when the commuter
train hit ashock-absorbing barrier
at less than 12 mph (20 kph). But
these cars were more than four
decades old, "Toshiba Classics"
that were refurbished after being
cast off by other urban systems.
President Cristina Fernandez
declared two days of mourning
and sent at least four Cabinet
ministers out to give news con-
ferences describing the govern-
ment's response to the tragedy.
None took questions.
One man who might explain
why passengers said he repeat-
edly struggled with the train's
brakes before the accident -
motorman Marcos Antonio Cor-

doba, 28 - remained in intensive
care and had yet to make a state-
ment.
The current transportation
secretary, Juan Pablo Schiavi,
said the train's speed while
approaching its final stop at the
busy downtown once station
was normal, that the motorman
was already slowing and that he
should have been able to stop dur-
ing the final 130 feet (40 meters)
from the point where the speed
was last recorded.
"Those last 40 meters today
remain a mystery," Schiavi said.
The crash happened after Cor-
doba had traveled the length of
the Sarmiento line - 14 stations.
Before him, another motorman
had driven the same route 10
times, since 2:45 a.m. Wednesday
morning. Union leaders said the
train was in good condition when
checked the day before.
Auditor General Leandro
Despouy, however, said TBA had
been failing safety requirements
since 2002. Many of these compli-
ance problems were raised in an
extremely critical report in 2008,
which recommended ending the
concession granted to TBA in
1995 during Argentina's privati-
zation era.
"Back in 2008 we had verifi-
cation of dramatic and alarming
brake problems," Despouy said.
Roque Cirigliano, TBA's trains
director and a cousin of the com-
pany's owners, discounted the
possibility of brake failure and
said human error might have
caused the crash. He called the
trains safe for travel, and said
TBA has spent more on mainte-
nance than other Argentine rail-
road companies, despite company
complaints that government lim-
its on ticket prices have depressed
revenues.
On its website, TBA says low
ticket prices mean passengers
don't cover even half the salaries
and benefits of its 4,500 workers.
Because the government keeps
prices low as a benefit to working-
class Argentines, the company
struggles to cover operating costs,
provide higher quality service,

and attract private financing to
fund improvements, it says.
The train company has been
tied to allegations of government
corruption.
Former Transport Secretary
Ricardo Jaime awaits trial for
allegedly approving millions
of dollars in government train
subsidies after accepting free
Brazilian vacation flights from
businessman Claudio Cirigliano.
Cirigliano's Grupo Plaza hold-
ing company owns both TBA and
competing bus lines.
The judge in the corruption
case, Claudio Bonadio, is now in
charge of the accident investiga-
tion.
Schiavi said yesterday's news
conferences and the government's
support of a thorough crash probe
by Bonadio proves Fernandez's
administration is acting respon-
sibly.
The train's "black box" record-
ings of conversations between the
motorman and control room were
already in the judge's hands, and
other evidence abounds, from GPS
data to cameras and other record-
ings as well as physical evidence
from the wrecked train, he said.
With 703 injuries among the
estimated 1,500 passengers, thou-
sandsofpeople desperatelyrushed
around Buenos Aires checking
lists of survivors and hoping their
loved ones weren't in the morgue.
Many of the dozen or more hos-
pitals that treated the injured said
they had no unidentified patients,
and by Thursday afternoon the
morgue had identified allSO fatali-
ties.
The Bolivian Embassy
announced that a pregnant con-
sular official, Nayda Tatiana Lez-
ano Alandia, was amongthe dead.
She left behind three daughters,
Argentina's state-run Telam news
agency reported.
Sabrina Espindola, 29, who
worked downtown by day and
studied to be a surgical assistant
until midnight each night, was
pulled from the first car, her hus-
band, X-ray technician Ezequiel
Mercado, told The Associated
Press.

such as creating the Bahi'i Insti-
tute for Higher Education in
Iran - but these methods have
not always been successful.
"Some days the government
would come and raid the facili-
ties where they had some equip-
ment or books or things like that
... more recently they've really
cracked down on it and shut it
down," Van de Fliert said.
He added that the University
could support the Baha'i stu-
dents by accepting their transfer
credits from the BIHE toward a
University degree.
"I know the Harvard Gradu-
ate School of Education actually
said that they would ... accept
(BIHE credit) .... to complete
degrees for Harvard Graduate
School of Education," he said.
"So I don't know if that's going
to happen here, but clearly that
could be an outcome of such a
thing."
Rackham student Sanam
Arab, president of the club, said
aside from raising awareness,
the club would like to serve as
a catalyst for further action.
He noted that at the Univer-
sity, James Wooliscroft, Medi-
cal School dean, has helped the
effort by teaming with other
deans around the country to
draft a letter to the United
Nations and Iranian government
against the unfair treatment to
Baha'I students.
"We are hoping that maybe
we can approach different deans
of the University as well and ask
them to doa similar thing," Arab
said.
Van de Fliert emphasized that
the club does not intend to put

down or criticize the Iranian
government.
"The Baha'i faith teaches that
we are well wishers of all people
and all governments," he said.
"Basically what we are trying to
do is just to bring to attention the
situation of the Bahi'i students
in Iran and then hope that this
will come to the attention of the
officials in the Iranian govern-
ment to have them open a way
for students ... to enter universi-
ty in Iran without fear ofoppres-
sion."
LSA junior Katayoon Sabet
Sarvestani said she came to the
United States in 2009 to escape
persecution in Iran. She was
studying pharmaceutical sci-
ence at the BIHE, but had to
leave after her professors were
arrested and the school build-
ings were shut down.
Sarvestani said professors
transformed their homes into
labs to help the students learn
chemistry and other physical
sciences after the government
shut down its facilities BIHE's
2008.
"They didn't want you to
know where the lab was actu-
ally located and nobody had the
address," she said. "(My pro-
fessor) said 'I will pick you up
from this street, the others from
another street, and I will take
you all to the lab.' We were just
going to a general chemistry lab
- nothing illegal - but it felt so
illegal."
Though the Baha'i students
and faculty have been dealing
with government opposition
since opening the BIHE, they
continue to try to find ways to
study and learn.
Sarvestani said the BIHE still
operates by allowing students
to take classes online and meet

oice per semester in Tehran.
She added that many of the stu-
dents travel to other countries
such as the United States, Eng-
land and Canada to earn their
degrees, and then return to Iran
to teach other students of their
faith.
"It's been around five months
(since) they arrested the main
professors of the university .
including the president and the
deans also," she said. "Some
of them are even graduates of
MIT and Stanford ... that were
back there teaching their fellow
citizens, but they were arrested
just because they are teaching in
that school."
Sarvestani said the Ira-
nian government does allow a
few students from the faith to
matriculate into the country's
universities in order to create
the impression that the Baha'i
students are welcomed.
"There are definitely less
than 50 Baha'i students who are
actually enrolled in university,"
she said. "After a few years, the
government will ask them to
leave."
LSA freshman Arya Ahmady
said Americans are lucky for
their vast freedoms and liber-
ties.
"You know sometimes we
dread or complain about classes *
and stuff here when in reality
people halfway across the world
only wish to have the opportu-
nities that we have," he said.
The club plans to hold an
event on March 27 to raise
awareness about the issue,
which will feature a documen-
tary screening and a panel and
interactive discussion about the
Bahu'i faith and the discrimi-
natory treatment its followers
receive in Iran.

Romney attacks
Santorum's voting
record in senate
Republican presidential candi-
date Mitt Romney tried to upend
Rick Santorum's image as a prin-
cipled defender of conservative
ideals yesterday, telling voters
that the former senator is just
another give-and-take politician.
Romney's team believes Santo-
rum opened himself to the attacks
with a somewhat anguished
explanation of his reluctant vote
for a Bush-era school program
in Wednesday's televised debate.
Romney hoped to stop his chief
rival's momentum on a day when
Santorum was quietly raising
money.
But President Barack Obama
wasn't helping. His allies aired
anti-Romney ads in 'Michigan

Florida, a crucial swing state that

Claims surface that
Mormans batized
Anne Frank
A new claim has surfaced that
the Mormon church has posthu-

The allegations come just a
week after The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints apolo-
gized when it was brought to light
that the parents of Holocaust sur-
vivor and Jewish rights advocate
Simon Wiesenthal were posthu-
mously baptized by church mem-
bers at temples in Arizona and
Utah in late January.
Researcher Helen Radkey, a
former Mormon who revealed
the Wiesenthal baptisms, said
this week she found Frank's name
in proxy baptism records dated
Feb. 18, showing the ritual was
performed in the Santo Domingo
Temple in the Dominican Repub-

Syrian gov't could
face U.N. probe
The United Nations has a
secret list of top Syrian officials
who could face investigation for
crimes against humanity carried
out by security forces in Syria's
crackdown on an uprising, a panel
of U.N. human rights experts said
yesterday.
The U.N. experts indicated
the list goes -as high as President
Bashar Assad.
Thousands of Syrians have died
in the violence since March and
the panel, citing what it called a
reliable source, said at least 500
children are amongthe dead.
"A reliable body of evidence
exists that, consistent with other
verified circumstances, provides
reasonable grounds to believe that
particular individuals, includ-
ing commanding officers and
officials at the highest levels of
government, bear responsibil-
ity- for crimes against human-
ity and other gross human rights
violations," said the report by

colleges.
Chemistry Prof. emeritus
Lawrence Bartell said the Uni-
versity has felt pressure to hire
women in recent years, adding
that he has observed a higher
number of females than males
hired in his department.
"I think there was a preju-
dice that females didn't have
the same driving force as
males," Bartell said. "But it has
been contradicted by perfor-
mance by females once they
have a chance."
Bartell added that tests have
shown females do equally as
well as males in areas like sci-
ence, math and spatial abilities,
lauding his female colleagues
in the chemistry department
as valuable assets to University
research initiatives.
"Our department chair is a
woman, our dean was a woman
until recently and our presi-
dent is a woman," Bartell said.
"My colleagues in chemistry
have a much greater apprecia-
tion for women than we used
to. I think the University of
Michigan is very liberal in this
approach.".
Bartell said he has wit-
nessed significant change in
societal beliefs over the years
regarding women in the work-

will continue to take place in
the future.

the Jewish community, as well
as for immigrants coming to
learn and thrive in America,
particularly in creating a stron-
ger, more diverse nation.
"Diversity is a source of
strength in this country," he
said. "Celebrate it (and) use it to
the advantage of the world."
Martin Shichtman, director
of the Jewish Studies Program
at EMU, said he was deeply hon-
ored that Levin came to speak at
the event.

"At the heart of Jewish tra-
dition is the value of 'Tikkun
Olam,' the admonition to repair
the world, make it more per-
fect, and build a model society,"
Shichtman said. "I can think of
no greater practitioner of 'Tik-

science-related field.
"I encourage all students
to pursue their interest in sci-
ence or outside of science and
not worry about being a minor-
ity," Elvang said. "They should
instead focus on doing well and
doing their best."
Carli Arendt, a Rackham
student who is also a gradu-
ate student instructor, said she
believes she is defying stereo-
types'as a female science stu-
dent and is setting an example
in a field where males comprise
a majority.
"In general, Michigan is
doing better than other uni-
versities," Arendt said. "If you
look at the older faculty, you'll
see that they are mainly male.
But the younger faculty, it's
pretty much 50-50. They are
making it so that females have
equal opportunity."
LSA freshman Austin Yarger
said a person's gender does not
matter in the scientific field
because it is unrelated to an
individual's ability to conduct
research.
Yarger added that she
believes the University should
not implement additional poli-
cies to increase the number of
female science faculty mem-
bers
"I feel that going out of one's
way to encourage a specific
group to perform in a specific
way seems to be impractical,"
Yarger said. "The University
already has a comprehensive
nondiscriminatory policy that
covers a wide spectrum of soci-
etal issues."
LSA freshman Jasmine
Garmo suggested that the lib-
eral environment on campus
and in the Ann Arbor com-
munity serves as reason why
gender equality has not been
perceived as an issue at the
University.
"I don't thinka person's gen-
der identity matters as much
here as it would in a more
conservative environment,"
Garmo said. "Some of the best
professors who have taught me
science-related subjects here
are actually females."
kun Olam' than Michigan Sena-
tor Carl Levin."
EMU provost Kim Schatzel
introduced Levin at the event
and said EMU takes great
pride in creating a welcoming
and diverse campus, lauding
the Jewish Studies minor for
adding another dimension to
EMU's diversity.
Max Rashes, a member of
EMU Hillel, said he came to the
event to listen to Levin, who he
considers to be an important
Jewish politician.
"Carl Levin isjust a cool guy,"
Rashes said. "It's nice to have
senators come to Eastern to talk
to students."
Beni Henig, a Washtenaw
Community College student,
said he attended the event
because of his ties with EMU
Hillel.
"I'm very active in the Hil-
lel," he said. "I felt it would be
my place to go there and check
it out."

EMU junior William McDon-
ald said he attended due to his
interestingovernmentandpoli-
tics, and wanted to hear from a
prominent official.
"As a political science major,
I'm just interested in what a
(senator) has to say," he said.

PRIMARY
From Page 1
ever, he added that Romney has
proven victorious in splintering
the vote among the other candi-
dates including Santorum, former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas).
As his Republican rivals have
lost popularity and focus has
shifted to the matchup between
Santorum and Romney, the for-
mer Massachusetts governorhas
been less able to disguise his less
conservative ideologies, Hutch-
ings said. He suggested that this
has resulted in increased sup-
port for Santorum.
"If (Santorum) is becoming
the anti-Romney candidate as
opposed to there being mul-
tiple anti-Romney candidates
who split the vote, well, that
spells trouble for Mitt Romney,"
Hutchings said.
Still, Hutchings suggested
that a victory for Santorum in
the Michigan primary would be
more essential than it would be
for Romney, particularly since
Romney's campaign is better
funded and organized and could
potentially make a comeback
more easily if he loses.
According to Hutchings, if
Santorum loses the Michigan pri-
mary, the loss might damage his
rising perception among Repub-
lican voters as a viable opponent
to President Barack Obama in
November's general election, sub-
sequently hindering his fundrais-

ing efforts.
"In many respects, it's actually
more of a make-or-break state
for Santorum than it is for Rom-
ney," Hutchings said. "(Santorum)
needs to rack up a series of victo-
ries in order to generate more rev-
enue on behalf of his campaign.
If he loses here, particularly after
appearing to have the momen-
tum, it's going to be increasingly
difficult for him."
Given the unit rule in the
Republican nomination - that
most state's primary elections
award all their delegates to the
Republican National Conven-
tion to the winner of the popular
vote - this year's race has lasted-
longer than most, according to
Political Science Prof. Nicholas
Valentino.
He suggested that indecision
among Republican voters who
think Romney is not conservative
enough and Santorum is not elect-
able enough could elongate the
nomination, but Valentino added
that he was unsure why Republi-
can voters have taken this long to
choose anominee.
"That's the $64,000 question,
is why this year, when seemingly
the incumbent president is in a
historically weak position with
regard to the economy and jobs,
the opposition couldn't more
quickly settle on a (candidate),"
he said.
Like Hutchings, Valentino said
Romney has had trouble connect-
ing with the party's Republican
base, causing a growth in support
for Santorum.

"People are gettingthe ideathat
(Santorum might have a chance,
actually, in the general election,"
Valentino said. "And they might
vote for him. His viability is much
higher than it once was."
Valentino added that a win for
Santorum in the Michigan pri-
mary could be an enormous blow
to Romney.
"A win in Michigan would be a
very symbolic, powerful victory
because this is Mitt Romney's
birth state," he said. "This could
be very, very important for San-
torum's campaign."
However, LSA senior Brian
Koziara, external vice chair of
the College Republicans, said he
predicted Romney would win the
Michigan primary. He compared
the upcoming primary to the
situation in Florida last'month,
where he said Gingrich was
doing well in polls after a victory
in South Carolina, before Rom-
ney unleashed a barrage of attack
ads against the former speaker.
He added that he believes
Romney will still be the more
electable candidate against
Obama, particularly in Michi-
gan, which has historically
served as a swing state in presi-
dential elections.
"Michigan Republicans
understand that if Michigan
goes red in the general election,
it's going to be very difficult for
President Obama to get a sec-
ond term," he said. "Republicans
don't have to win Michigan in
order to get the White House.
Democrats do."

HOT TUB

Chris Wendel said he had the
opportunity to see the func-
tioning tub and confirm that the
rooftop Jacuzzi was indeed real.
"I thought it was fake at first,
but then I went over and saw it
for myself," Wendel said.
Engineering senior David Por-
ter said he heard about the hot
tub fromhis friends and aposton
the social news site Reddit.
"When I saw the Reddit post,,
I was in the Duderstadt (Center)
studying on Sunday afternoon,
and people were already mur-

imuring about it," Porter said.
Porter said he had the oppor-
tunity to use the hot tub, along
with two professors and several
other graduate students, adding
that the group joked that the
Jacuzzi might have an impact on
recruiting top-level students.
Similar pranks like the hot
tub incident have happened at
other schools, like the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technolo-
gy, where student hackers have
previously documented their
trickery on a website depicting
moments like the placing of a
replica campus police cruiser
on the roof of an academic
building in 1994.

I have logged over 1000 hours as a

That's TEN x TEN x TEN! I was the first

first aid squad during high school
and I haven't stopped volunteering
since then. Whether I am home for
Thanksgiving or spring break, I can be found riding in

Boundaries overreached
NYPD's student surveillence was unwarranted
t has come to light that the New York City Police Department
has been secretly spying on Muslim student groups at colleges in
New York and across the East Coast. Officers were even placed
at universities to monitor and report on the activities of Muslim stu-
dents without justified cause of wrongdoing. The NYPD unfairly
targeted hundreds of innocent college students in violation of fun-
damental liberties. It's frightening to see the abuse of power caused
by Islamophobia. A thorough investigation is needed to ensure such
unwarranted surveillance never occurs again.

The stories statuses tell

On Saturday, the Associated Press report-
ed that the NYPD had conpiled a 60-page
report on Muslims living in Long Island and
New York City. The reports detailed con-
versations and contained video recordings
of mosques and other community events, in
addition to personal information about indi-
viduals. Later, the AP also divulged that the
NYPD monitored Muslim college students
along the East Coast. Every week Police
Commissioner Raymond Kelly was updated
with information. These reports included
names of students, how many times a day
they prayed and their organizations and
activities.
In a bizarre case in April 2008, one under-
cover NYPD officer traveled to upstate New
York with 18 Muslim students of the CityCol-
lege of New York's Muslim Student Associa-
tion. The students prayed, discussed Islam
and went white-water rafting - all of it was
recorded daily by the undercover officer.
Without cause, their names were reported
back to the NYPD for further investigation.
This is alarming in a country where freedom
of religion, civil liberties and the notion that
someone is innocent until proven guilty are
all encouraged.
It's especially alarming that the cities and
universities where this monitoring occurred
weren't informed beforehand. The NYPD
initially began surveillance only within New
York City, but soon expanded as far as the

University of Pennsylvania, Syracuse Uni-
versity, Yale University and Rutgers Univer-
sity. Not only are these universities outside of
NYPD's jurisdiction, but they were unaware
of the secret surveillance happening on their
campuses. The NYPD clearly overreached,
and this breach of policy and power is alarm-
ing, especially considering the strength and
size of the NYPD.
Police spokesman Paul Browne defended
the actions taken by NYPD by saying that 12
individuals convicted and arrested on terror-
ism charges in the past had been members
of Muslim Student Associations. Browne's
argument nowhere near justifies the surveil-
lance of an innocent group of college students
without any cause of suspicion. The NYPD's
actions take racial profiling to a new level,
instilling suspicion and fear among commu-
nities, infracting upon the rights of Muslim
Americans and perpetuating Islamophobia.
Muslim Americans are constantly being
forced to defend their personal religion and
heritage, and demonizing an entire religion
for the actions of an overwhelming minority
is irrational.
The surveillance of these students is
shameful for the NYPD. It had no right
or jurisdiction to vilify innocent students
across the United States for no reason, beside
their religion. To work toward an inclusive
and diverse America, public officials should
be working toward, not against, tolerance.

S pring break starts today.
For those of us not going
anywhere - myself includ-
ed - this can
be quite a sad --
experience. It's
especially bad
when you open
up Facebook and
are suddenly
bombarded by
beaches, tans
and people hav- ADRIENNE
ing more fun ROBERTS
than you some-
where far warm-
er, far away.
In comparison to some of my
friends, my Facebook is quite lack-
luster. I have yet to upload one pic-
ture, my information section is
severely incomplete and the last
status update is from 11th grade
when I thought it was appropriate to
say, "Long car ride...txt me please."
Maybe the word "tragic" is more fit-
ting than "lackluster."
I'm in the minority in this disre-
gard for properly updating my Face-
book page. Many of my Facebook
friends have lovely statuses each day
describing how great their relation-
ship is, how everyone should be a
little less cynical about love or, my
personal favorite, look how smart I
am, I got this amazing internship.
Seeing all these updates, it's quite
possible to leave Facebook feeling
depressed and inadequate.
So, it was no surprise when a recent
study from the University of Hous-
ton found a link between college
students' time spent on Facebook
and depression symptoms. Another
study similarly found that the more
time Facebook users spent on their
news feed, the lower self-esteem
they had afterwards.

At its core, Facebook is a tool forl
social connections. Timeline, pages,<
groups, chat and messages all serve]
to aid dialogue between individuals
and groups. Users have a multitude
of options to communicate with
family members, specific friends and
various acquaintances.
With all these options available, I
find it astonishing that the statuses
are still relevant. Facebook friends
aren't always exactly friends. From
accepting a friend request from that.-
person you talked to once in a lec-
ture, to begrudgingly adding your
bratty 13-year-old sister, friends
may not be the appropriate word for
those who have access to our page. ,
Then why do people feel the need1
to share every thought with them?
The answer is that Facebook is oneI
of the easiest places to cast yourselfi
in the best light possible. Want toI
be perceived as funny? Spend a few1
minutes crafting a status from the
script of today's Daily Show. Do you
wish your family and old friendsI
from high school thought you were.
really successful? Well then, high-i
light all of your accomplishments
and never, ever mention any failures.
Perhaps the easiest way to rid oneself
of these overly, enthusiastic Face-
book users would be to just delete
them. However, this may not always
be an option. Sometimes, FacebookI
is the easiest way to communicate
with someone, and to keep the chan-
nel open we tolerate their boasting
and complaining.
It's quite easy to get engrossed ini
the stories that statuses tell. But
that's just it - statuses are merelyI
a fabricated and often false biogra-
phy of one's life. A status must be
taken with a grain of salt because
that annoying couple that professed
their undying love through their

keyboards is probably currently
arguing, hiding behind a public
Facebook mask.
Facebook posts
are often false
biographies.
In an ideal world, Facebook
wouldn't really matter much for
most people. Communication
would be direct, and you would
have to do more than just stalk
someone's information page to
know his or her life story. But this
isn't the case in today's world. Face-
book is now an important social
tool used for sharing world news,
maintaining contact with people
from other countries and bringing
people together for valuable causes.
We need to take a step back some-
times, and think about what sepa-
rates truth from fabrication, and
what is appropriate to express to
every single one of our 'friends.'
Statuses are becoming irrelevant
and if we can all treat them as such,
Facebook might just become a little
less annoying.
This week, as I spend spring break
at home, you can find me applying
ample amounts of self-tanner and
crying myself to sleep while look-
ing at old vacation photos. But you
wouldn't know that from my Face-
book.

W. ETHAN EAGLE I

GSRAs should look to RSG TIM RABBI

I am 100 percent in favor of graduate stu-
dent research assistants having a voice on
campus and standing up to the University if
they need to, but where is there open debate
about the value, the cost or the alternatives
to unionization? All I hear are two sides, one
loudly shouting principally about the down-
sides while ignoring the benefits, the other
proclaiming the benefits while never address-
ing the costs.
The situation, for me, comes down to this:
Some students are in a good advising situ-
ation, but what are we willing to do to pro-
vide for students who aren't? Meanwhile, the
conversation has divided students into two
groups: those worried about cost and those
worried about protecting our collective inter-
ests. There are two questions being discussed.
First, are GSRA employees - and does this
distinction matter? - and second, who do
GSRAs want to protect them?
Regarding the first question, if we "win"
this fight to call graduate students graduate
employees then no one really wins. As employ-
ees first and studentssecond, it becomes all too
clear we are actually the University's GEARs
(Graduate Employee Assistant Researchers).
Let's face it. The University couldn't oper-
ate without GSRAs. Talk of "employee" sta-
tus really takes the focus away from whether
GSRAs need protection. If we do need protec-
tion, and we can't get it, we would need to be
employees to force the University to allow it.
So, whom do we need protection from and
who should do the protecting?
Well, we need protection when other
groups decide what's best for us. For example,
the will of all students to unionize shouldn't
have been assumed by Gradate Employees'
Organization when it attempted to accrete
GSRAs without a vote, and the Senate and
SAGU should likewise stop their attempts to
prevent a vote from happening.
So, if you want effective, efficient sup-
port and protection for students, it probably
seems like the only options so far are either
to be anti-union (let the University decide
what's best) or pro-employee union (hire a
negotiator to fight for us). I reject this false
dichotomy in favor of a student run 'union'
that already exists. It's called the Rackliam
Student Government.

Right now do we just let the University
decide what's best? When was the last time
the University made students really worry?
Remember continuous enrollment? Through
it all, it was collaboration between RSG, GEO
and the University that enacted the Continu-
ous Enrollment Dispute Resolution Board and
the Continuous Enrollment Working Group
to resolve student concerns. So far as I know,
the roll out process has gone more smoothly
than predicted. So, GEO, what's changed? Is
the University suddenly deaf to the concerns
of GSRAs and RSG?
I thank GEO and the American Federation
of Teachers of Michigan for the work they
have done to bring to light the issues in the
current system. In particular, their campaign
has demonstrated that students benefit from
direct classroom or lab outreach. Moreover,
it's clear we need a system to protect students
from academic disputes just as we did during
the continuous enrollment. I hope that GEO
and RSG will work with departments around
the University to adopt fair and transparent
procedures for students 'who must dispute
being let go for academic reasons. Such a pol-
icy should come from collaboration -there
is no academic distinction between GSIs and
GSRAs.
As students, we should alhstand in support
of each other. If you know, or you are, a GSRA
that needs support please speak up. Don't
keep itto yourself. RSG and GEO only work for
you if you talk to them first. We all understand
that things break occasionally and require
work to maintain.
Just how much does it cost to negotiate
with the University? GSRAs could start pay-
ing $400 a year for professionals to come
and make contract adjustments every three
years. But if we don't demand a guarantee, if
we just want to be heard, we could continue
paying $3 a year to RSG. And even though
we're not spending our own money - the uni-
versity ultimately pays these fees either way
- doesn't it make sense to use the $3 fix 'til it
stops working?

Silence is still complicity

As a junior high student, I was privileged to travel
to North Carolina with my choir, where we recorded a
few songs at a pastoral studio in Chapel Hill. After lay-
ing down some tracks, we stopped at a migrant farm that
acts as a supplier to the Mt. Olive Pickle Company, which
controls the largest market share for pickles inthe United
States. The trip was organized at the behest of the Farm
Labor Organizing Committee, alabor union that champi-
ons wage increases for Midwestern farm workers.
The trip included a tour of the workers' living quar-
ters, which were rickety wooden shacks with bunks and
kitchenettes housed in a single room. The air indoors
was as dank and muggy as the climate outdoors, with
no air conditioning to mitigate the sweltering heat. The
ancient stoves, over which the workers' wives cooked
dinner, raised the indoor temperatures to unbearably
hot levels and were thus used sparingly. Watermarks
covered all four walls, permeating the wood; they made
us anxious to leave for fear that the whole rotten struc-
ture might collapse on our heads.
The union organizers told us that many of the undoc-
umented immigrants who work at the camps are lured
to the U.S. with promises of a country overflowing with
money and a home for each man and his family. Upon
arriving, however, the workers are met with a far less
pleasant reality. Many are forced to pay a substantial fee
from their weekly paycheck, lest the smugglers report
them to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
The fee effectively prevents any upward social mobil-
ity and strands the men in the camps with no money to
send home and no means to bring their families across
the border.
As you can imagine, the short-lived visit to the farm
was by far the most moving aspect of the choir trip -
one that I was rudely reminded of after reading about
the working conditions at the Foxconn plant in Shen-
zhen, China. If you didn't read the New York Times
article that started the latest upheaval over the plant,
Foxconn is the company that manufactures consumer
products for Amazon, Apple, Dell, HP, Intel, Micro-
soft, Nintendo and thousands of other electronics com-

panies worldwide.
Many workers inthese complexes are women who earn
barely $50 a week and some forced to spend half their sal-
ary on room and board within the complex. Room and
board apparently means sharing a room with one hun-
dred other workers, having only a bucket to wash your
clothes in, and being prohibited from hosting any visitors.
.Ifthat'snot enough, Foxconnlaborers -manyof whom
are underage - often work 15-hour, seven-day weeks and
have been exposed to toxic chemicals that cause nerve
damage. Others die in factory explosions or commit sui-
cide due to what they've come to deem a "meaningless"
life with virtually no working relationships. The New
York Times couldn't have summed it up better with its
headline: "Human Costs Are Built Into an Pad."
Much of this information has been available since
2006 - Apple published a company press release on its
web page promising to audit working conditions at the
plant following a brutal wave of media criticism. In the
wake of the Times' latest write-up, they've done the
same thing, this time with a little follow-through, and
the audit apparentlyreported"tonsofissues." Surprised?
At the very least one might argue that in the Mt.
Olive case, among others, the workers enjoy a compara-
tive advantage over their past conditions. An Aug. 2,
2005 article in the Christian Science Monitor reported
that the average apparel worker in Honduras, in spite of
sweatshop conditions, makes more per day than the aver-
age citizen. The comparative advantage argument may
hold weight in selectcases, but not when conditions drive
employees to take their own lives. That's no advantage.
There's a serious problem with our ownership of
these products and our continued willingness to buy
them. It's an insidious form of complicity that silently
tells our generation and those that follow: "It's O.K.,
what you don't know can't hurt you." It's our responsi-
bility as consumers to boycott all electronics companies
supplied by Foxconn, lest we continue in our current
state of unconsciousness.

sion of Ken Free
Friedman's
"Mandatory
Happening," which was known
to the Fluxus artists as an event
score.
With spring quickly approach-
ing, UMMA is preparing to
launch an extensive project
an exhibition, "Fluxus and the
Essential Questions of Life,'
and four months of programt-
ming surrounding this topic. To
kick the Flxuts festivities off
UMMA is opening its gallery
show tomorrow.
Describing art as disconiect-
ed and spontaneous as Fluxus is
difficult, since the movement is
neither clear nor linear, accord-
ing to Educational and Curatori-
al Deputy Director Ruth Slavin
She said Fluxus only makes sense
iin little, fleeting epilihanies.
"Perhaps the best isay to con-
ceive of Fluxus art is to think o1
the movement as one centered on
a conceptual base and not on an
aesthetic or form," Slavin said
"In that way it was very avant-
garde, very unique for the Cold
War era."
Though the range of debates
about Fluxus is immense, its edg-
iness is rarely debated. Founded
by Lithuanian-American art-
ist George Maciunas, Fluxus
was inspired by the experimen-
tal music of John Cage in New
York, and the movement became
a group of international artists
organized by Maciunas. The
Fluxus artists were not bound

by culture or twedium but were
instead connected by a desire
to question the high art of the
museum and to blur the lines
between art and life. Their tool
was a form of performance art
often using prop-kits, which they
called Fluxkits. These Fluxkits
and event scores -- like the
Friedman - made up the Fluxus
events, which they termed "hap-
penings."
"Sometimes these Fluxkits
and event scores were humorous;
sometimes, they were boring or
offensive, silly or even annoying,
but they always raised questions
about the art itself," said Lisa
Borgsdorf, public prograns and
campus engagement manager
for UMMA.
'f'akte Alisona Knowvles's 1962
event scoire "iopositioa," a plait2
piece of paper with the inscrip-
tion: "Make a salad." Below it,
a video of Knowles making the
salad plays on a television screen.
"It's actually quite interesting,
once you get past the reaction to
looking at a piece of paper and
what appears to be a loop of the
Food Channel," Slavin said. "It
questions creation, domestic-
ity and whether the art of salad
timaking rivals the museum can-
vases - where is art's valuation?"
Another debatable issue is
whether it's the event score
that's vital or the actual trial of
enactment that carries artistic
value. For example, Knowles's
"Wounded Furniture" reads:
"This piece uses an ol piece of
ffurniture in bad shape. Destroy
it further, if you like. Bandage
it up with gauze and adhesive.
Spray red paint on the wounded
joints."
f Since no original version off
this piece exists, University
Housing has allowed students
in five dormitories to recreate
the event and actually destroy a
piece of furniture. One of these
final pieces will have the honor
of being the first student work to
ever be exhibited in the gallery.
"Swaying between intrigue
and annoyance is not the 'wrong'
way to feel about an event score,"
Borgsdorf said. "Works like
a Knowles' force you to think out-
side the traditional aesthetic and
sformal terms. Instead, it asks you
to debate whether it is the idea,
i the work or the performer who is

creating art."
With works like these plain
event scores, which almost
require enactment and partici-
pation to understand their mes-
sage, the question of organizing
a museum show true to the Flux-
us mood has become a focus for
the UMMA staff.
"In presenting the show, we're
trying something very differ-
ent," Slavin said. "Because Flux-
us was so anart-- that is, against
fine-art labels - it really is only
reaching the museum as a histor-
ic item. That's why we're striv-
ing to break the show's concepts
down and ask people to experi-
ment and experience Fluxus in
their own time."
The exhibit explores how
Fluxus works by isolatingthe dif-
ferent tlaemes and splitting them
into 14 major questions - such as
"What Am I?,""Happiness?" and
"Danger?" - which drove the
movement. Since there is no spe-
cific pathway alongthe exhibit, a
provided map will direct visitors
to those questions in which they
are most interested. The objects
in each theme reflect an answer
or ask a further question.
"In (the them(e) 'Change?'
Fluxus artists conclude that
going with it can be a lot more
fun than trying to fight it," said
Stephanie Miller, manager of
public affairs and publications
at UMMA. "As Ken Filedman
suggests with his Flux Corsage
- a plastic box filled with flower
seeds - you might get started
by getting yourself some flower
seeds, planting and nurturing
them, and giving the blossoms to
someone you love. The plant will
die eventually, and so might your
love, but neither of them will
disappear; they will change into
some other form of energy."
Fluxus was an integral part
of pioneering performance art
and bringing anart into perspec-
tive. Even though the movement
has now passed into history, the
mantras and ideals held by the
group exist today.
"I'm convinced that if they
had the Internet, they would
have used it," Slavin said. "Maci-
unas would be tweeting and on
Facebook. The sprit of Fluxus
lives on in the intermedia today;
the flash mobs and the viral vid-
eos are the new happenings."

"Ahhh Mr Potter. Welcome to therapy."
Gervais, Dan.,vi s bring
humrt B' Short'

By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily Arts Writer
On HBO's new comedy, "Life's
Too Short," creators Rickey
Gervais and Stephen Merchant
once again
find humor in
the awkward-
ness of daily Life'sToo
life. It's shot S
in the "moc hort
kumentary" Pilot
style that Ger-
vais so lives, a Sundays at
style that lends 10-30 t.
itself perfectly HBO
to exploiting
everyday embarrassment.
Contrary to all the promo-
tion dropping of Gervais's name,
"Life's Too Short" is centered on
actor Warwick Davis, who calls
himself "the U.K.'s go-to dwarf."
Davis's other roles include Pro-
fessor Flitwick in the "Harry
Potter" films and an ewok in
"Star Wars," which he men-
tions multiple times in this pilot.
Davis plays an egotistical cari-
cature of himself, running an
agency called DwarvesForHire.
The humor comes from his lack
of self-awareness, not from his
being a dwarf. When he goes to
Gervais and Merchant looking
for work, Gervais's "I thought

Leaders demand
progress from East
African cocntry
LONDON (AP) - World lead-
ers pledged new help to tackle
terrorism and piracy in Somalia,
but insisted yesterday that the
troubled East African nation must
quickly form a stable government
and threatened penalties against
those who hamper its progress.
Nations pledged new fund-
ing, additional training for sol-
diers and coast guards, increased
cooperation over terrorism and a
new drive to root out those who
finance and profit from piracy,
after the shipping industry paid
out $135 million in ransoms last
year.
"For two decades Somalia
has been torn apart by famine,
bloodshed and some of the worst
poverty on earth," British Prime
Minister David Cameron said,
as 55 nations and international
organizations, including Somalia's
United Nations-backed transi-
tional government, U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
and U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon attended the talks.
"If the rest of us just sit back
and look on, we will pay a price for

doingso," he added.
Cameron warned that Somalia's
al-Qaida linked militant group al-
Shabab could export terrorism
to Europe and the United States,
with dozens of British and Ameri-
can citizenstraveling to Somaliato
train and fight with the Islamists.
Somalia has had transitional
administrations for the past seven
years, but has not had a function-
ing central government since 1991,
when warlords overthrew a long-
time dictator and turned on each
other, plunging the nation into
chaos.
In a joint communique, leaders
hailed tentative signs of progress
- with pirate attacks in decline
and al-Shabab largely driven out
of the capital Mogadishu by an
African Union peacekeeping mis-
sion.
Despite differences expressed
over the role of al-Shabab in
Somalia's political future, the
summit conclusions called for "all
those willing to reject violence to
join" the country's U.N.-led peace
process. Nations also agreed to
"develop a defectors' program to
support those who leave armed
groups."
Clinton insisted the mandate of
Somalia's transitional government
must end as planned in August,
and warned travel bans and asset

freezes could be imposed against
anyone who attempts to stall polit-
ical progress.
Both a new president and new
legislators are due to be elected,
although the details of how elec-
tions will be carried out have not
yet been agreed. Somalia's bloated
Parliament, currently over 500
legislators, is due be cut in half to
form an upper and lower house
with 225 members and 54 sena-
tors.
"It's time to buckle down and
do the work that will bring stabil-
ity to Somalia for the first time in
tmatny of its people's lives," Clinton
told the conference.
Somalia's weak transitional
administration - which holds
Mogadishu with the support of
about 10,000 African Union sol-
diers - has been boosted after
the U.N. on Wednesday approved
an increase in the size of the AU
peacekeeping mission, known as
AMISOM, to about 17,700.
Al-Shabab, which earlier this
month formalized its relationship
with al-Qaida, is being hit from
three sides in Somalia: Pressed
out of Mogadishu by AMISOM
soldiers, while Kenyan forces who
moved into Somalia in October
pressure the militants from the
south and Ethiopian forces sweep
in from the west.

that she felt frivolously targeted
her and prompted her to write: "I
can't take it anymore."
The details are included
in more than 17,000 records
released yesterday by state offi-
cials - nearly 3 1/2 years after
citizens and news organizations,
including The Associated Press,
first requested Palin's emails.
By the spring of 2009, the
emails show, Palin was regularly
butting heads with lawmakers
of both parties over her absences
from the Capitol and over her
picks for vacancies in the state
Senate and her own cabinet. The
emails she sent to staff illustrate
Palin's growing suspicion that
those legislators were seeking
to undermine her administra-
tion by harping on how often she
was away from Juneau, the state
capitol.
She asked her aides to tally
how many days she was out of
Alaska in 2008. The staff came
up with 94 days, but 10 less if you
count travel days when she was
in the state part of the day, The
absences included all of October
and mostof September while she
was on the campaign trail as the
GOP vice presidential candidate.
"It's unacceptable, and there
must be push back on their
attempts to lame duck this
administration," Palin wrote to
her top aides on April 9. "That's
only going to get worse as they
try to pull more bs and capital-
ize on me being out of the capitol
building for 36 hours."
Palin also asked her aides to
see if they could hold certain
legislators' "feet to the fire" and
hold votes on her nominees. She
wrote words of encouragement
to Wayne Anthony Ross, her
nominee for attorney general,
tellinghim to "stay strong."
"Those who want to turn this
into a kangaroo court will soon
see you confirmed as Alaska's
AG," Palin wrote.
Ross was not confirmed, the
first ever cabinet level candidate
rejected by the Alaska Legisla-
ture. Palin traveled to an anti-
abortion rally in Indiana the day
he was defeated.
Tim Crawford, treasurer of
Sarah Palin's political action
committee, encouraged every-
one to read the emails. "They
show a governor hard at work for.
her state," he said.
The emails are the last of her
emails from her time as gover-
nor, according to Alaska state
officials. Citizens and news
organizations, including the AP,
first requested Palin's emails in
September 2008, as part of her
vetting as the Republican vice
presidential nominee. The state
released a batch of the emails

last June, a lag of nearly three
years that was attributed to the
sheer volume of the records and
the flood of requests stemming
from Palin's tenure.
The 24,199 pages of emails that
were released last year left off in
September 2008. When it became
clear that the June release would
not include all the emails from
Palin's tenure last June, 'equests
were then made for the remain-
ing emails. Thursday's release
includes 17,736 records, or 34,820
pages, generally spanning from
October 2008 until Palin's res-
ignation, in July 2009. Of those,
13,791 records were released
without redactions, according
to the governor's office. Another
965 documents were withheld.
Several media organizations,
including msnbe.com, said they
were not informed of Thursday's
release.
Sharon Leighow; a spokes-
woman for the current governor,
Sean Parnell, said records in the
governor's office indicated that
MSNBC.com did not request the
second group of emails but she
said a CD containing the docu-
ments was being sent to their
offices because it contained
emails inadvertently omitted
fromthe first release.
Palin's frustration over a series
of ethics complaints filed against
her, one of the issues she cited
when stepping down, emerges in
a series of e-mails on March 24,
2009.
"These are the things that
waste my time and money, and
the state's time and money," she
wrote to then-Lt. Gov. Parnell.
In an April 2009 email, she
commiserated over a story indi-
cating another ethics complaint
was to be filed: "Unflippinbeliev-
able... I'm sending this because
you can relate to the bullerap con-
tinuation of the hell these people
put the family through," she
wrote to Ivy Frye, an aide during
the first part of her term, and to
Frank Bailey.
Later that day, in an email to
her husband and two top aides,
on the issue, she said: "I can't take
it anymore."
The first batch of emails
released last June, before she
announced she would not run for
president, showed that Palin was
angling for the vice presidential
slot months before John McCain
picked her to be his running
mate. Those records produced
no bombshells, while painting a
picture of an image-conscious,
driven leader, struggling with the
gossip about her family and mar-
riage, involved in the day-to-day
duties of running the state and
keeping tabs on the signature
issues of her administration.

Rayburn had a game-high

The game was close until the

stretch the lead to 10, and Michi-
gan was forced to send Purdue
to the free-throw line to try for
a comeback.
The Boilermakers went 9-for-
10 from the charity stripe in the
second half and went 4-for-4 in
the last minute to seal the game.

But besides Purdue's final
push, neither team could really
find a rhythm. In the first half,
Purdue struggled to make a bas-
ket in a stretch of just over four
minutes, while the Wolverines
had nine turnovers.

along with corn
their sticks and
gloves. Michigan coach Red
Berenson has pounded the mes-
sage into their heads all week:
Don't sleep on Bowling Green.
As far as Berenson is concerned,
the Falcons' last-place standing
in the CCHA is far less impor-
tant than the gigantic target that
will replace the standard block
'M' on the Wolverines' jerseys.
With Bowling Green already hav-
ing locked up the bottom seed
for the conference tournament,
this weekend's series gives the
Falcons a chance to play spoiler.
With nothing to play for, Bowling
Green would love to dash Michi-
gan's title hopes, however slim
they may be.
"You know (Bowling Green's)
going to give you your best
because they're looking up at
you," Berenson said. "These are
the games you have to win. It'll be
a good test for us."
A lot would have to go right for
Michigan to claim a share of its
12th CCHA regular-season title.

ing Green and hope that West-
ern Michigan sweeps first-place
Ferris State. The Bulldogs have
already clinched at least a split
conference championship and
need just one point to win it all for
themselves. But the Broncos did
sweep Ferris State in a home-and-
home series earlier in the season.
There won't be much score-
board watching going on this
weekend under Berenson's
watchful eye. During Wednes-
day's practice, Berenson empha-
sized that if his team wants to be
viewed as one of the best teams in
the country, then it's time it starts
doing what those teams do - take
care of business late in the season.
"For example, we talked to
them (on Wednesday) about how,
if you're going to be a good team
- a winning team - you've got to
win the games you should win,"
Berenson said. "Those are the
toughest games to play."
And though Michigan finds
itself in the season's last weekend,

the Wolverines aren't looking to
stumble into the playoffs. Beren-
son still seeks improvement,
knowing that stagnant teams
rarely fare well as the calendar
turns to March.
"We've got to play better than
we played last week," Berenson
said. "We've got to keep moving
forward. We can't stay the same...
we've got to playbetter."
Both special teams units
enjoyed a perfect evening last Fri-
day against Northern Michigan.
The power play capitalized on
both of its opportunities, and the
penalty killers held the Wildcats
to a fruitless man advantage six
times. Saturday, the special-teams
units made another statement,
capitalizing on 50 percent of
power-play tries and keeping the
Northern Michigan power play
off the board once again.
Sophomore forward Derek
DeBlois, whose presence on the
penalty-kill unit has been impres-
sive, knows that Bowling Green

is no slouch despite the Falcons'
four measly conference victories.
"It's like any other weekend,"
DeBlois said. "They've been doing
pretty well in the second half.
... You can't look past any team.
You've got to prepare like any
other weekend (and) control our
own destiny, also."
The Wolverines seemed partic-
ularly focused in practice. Though
each player seemed to know of the
weekend's playoff implications,
nobody seemed too preoccupied
about what goes on at Western
Michigan's Lawson Ice Arena
and Ferris State's Ewigleben Ice
Arena. If their heads are in the
right place - not somewhere
northwest of Bowling Green -
everything will take care of itself.
"If the team talk is right, we'll
be right," Berenson said.

Douglass, Novak take to Crisler for final time

senior seasons,
when both of them had committed
to Michigan.
On Saturday, four years and 130
games later, the pair of Hoosier
State natives, whose fortunes at
Michigan have been inextrica-
bly bound, will take the court at
Crisler Center for the last time.
It will be the first senior-night
ceremony in two years for the
Wolverines. They didn't have any
seniors on the team last season,
so Novak and Douglass have been
the team's elder statesmen for two
years now. And though the senior
guards have been busy focusing on
the season, they've had moments
where the reality of their careers
coming to an end has hit them.
"It was kind of weird to think
about ... where we've come since
(freshman year)," Douglass said.
"It's a little bit of a blur, (and)
everything kind of gets jumbled
together, but it'sweird.
"It's kind of a mixture of both
