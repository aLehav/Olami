Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

issued an executive order on 

Monday morning closing all 

Michigan restaurants, bars and 

entertainment 
venues 
in 
an 

effort to slow the spread of the 

novel coronavirus. The order 

goes into effect at 3 p.m. on 

Monday and the restrictions 

will last until March 30.

The restrictions apply to bars, 

restaurants, coffee shops, movie 

theaters, clubs, gyms, recreation 

centers, 
spas 
and 
casinos, 

among other places of public 

accommodation.

According to a press release, 

the 
order 
allows 
dining 

establishments 
to 
continue 

providing delivery services and 

offering takeout, but restaurants 

may only let five people inside at 

a time to retrieve their orders. 

Customers 
must 
maintain 

six feet of distance between 

themselves, in accordance with 

social distancing protocols from 

public health authorities.

In 
a 
statement, 
Whitmer 

urged Michiganders to act with 

caution when they go into public 

spaces.

“This disease is a challenge 

unlike any we’ve experienced 

in 
our 
lifetimes,” 
Whitmer 

said. “Fighting it will cause 

significant 
but 
temporary 

changes to our daily lives. By 

practicing social distancing and 

taking aggressive action now, 

the state is working to mitigate 

the spread of coronavirus so 

we reduce the risk that our 

health care system becomes 

overwhelmed. This is about 

saving lives. Michiganders are 

tough and we are going to get 

through this, but it will require 

everyone doing their part. That 

means making smart choices and 

not putting yourself or others at 

risk by going out in public unless 

it is absolutely necessary.”

Social distancing refers to 

people maintaining six feet of 

space between one another and 

avoiding being in situations of 

close proximity to others as 

much as possible. 

In the press release, Joneigh 

S. Khaldun, Michigan’s chief 

medical executive and chief 

deputy director for health at the 

Michigan Department of Health 

and Human Services, said this 

was an important step to protect 

people 
from 
the 
spread 
of 

coronavirus.

Mayor calls 
on residents 
to stay home

‘U’ libraries, dining halls to shut down

VP of Student Life, UHS director urge students to return home if circumstances allow

Shortly after Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer 
issued 
an 
executive 

order to close all restaurants, bars 

and entertainment venues in the 

state on Monday, the University 

of Michigan closed libraries and 

moved dining halls to take-out 

only meals as fears about the 

spread of coronavirus continue 

to grow. The closure went into 

effect at 3 p.m. and will affect all 

Michigan Dining locations and 

University libraries. 

In a message on the University 

Library’s 
Twitter 
account, 

University officials announced 

that libraries would close at 3 p.m. 

but assured students, faculty and 

staff that most library resources 

would remain available online. 

A separate post on the Michigan 

Dining Twitter account notified 

students that beginning Monday 

night, dining halls across campus 

will not offer seating and will 

only serve takeout meals. Though 

residential halls remain open, 

University 
officials 
continue 

to encourage students to leave 

campus if they are able to in order 

to promote responsible social 

distancing. 

Social 
distancing 
includes 

limiting 
large 
gatherings 
of 

people, maintaining a distance of 

six feet in between one another 

and staying home as often as 

possible. 

In a press release, Whitmer 

said closing public spaces and 

disrupting 
daily 
routines 
is 

necessary in order to combat 

the virus and slow its spread. 

Whitmer highlighted the need 

for people to make individual 

sacrifices that contribute to these 

efforts. 

“This is about saving lives,” 

Whitmer 
said. 
“Michiganders 

are tough and we are going to get 

through this, but it will require 

everyone doing their part. That 

means making smart choices and 

not putting yourself or others at 

risk by going out in public unless it 

is absolutely necessary.”

2 — Tuesday, March 17, 2020
News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

With the rapidly evolving 

coronavirus 
outbreak 

in the United States and 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 

executive order, many local 

businesses are to remain 

temporarily closed. 

As 
of 
Monday 
night, 

there 
are 
54 
confirmed 

cases 
of 
COVID-19, 
the 

disease caused by the novel 

coronavirus, in Michigan. A 

case at the Vic Village-North 

student apartment building 

was 
announced 
Friday 

afternoon, 
shortly 
after 

University President Mark 

Schlissel disclosed that a 

member of the University of 

Michigan community tested 

positive for the virus. 

On Thursday evening, the 

city of Ann Arbor notified 

residents that all events with 

50 or more attendees would 

be canceled. Public spaces 

like the Ann Arbor Farmers 

Market, Ann Arbor City 

Hall, city parks and the Ann 

Arbor District Libraries are 

all closed. 

Some 
Ann 
Arbor 

businesses 
have 

independently decided to 

temporarily close in order 

to 
mitigate 
the 
virus’s 

spread. Those that remained 

open are already noticing a 

significant decrease in the 

amount of foot traffic and 

number of sales. 

Literati Bookstore, a staple 

book shop in Ann Arbor, has 

closed indefinitely due to 

concerns about the growing 

coronavirus 
outbreak. 

The 
change 
is 
effective 

immediately. 

Mike 
and 
Hilary 

Gustafson, the owners of 

Literati, wrote in an email to 

customers that the decision 

to close was difficult but 

reassured customers their 

store would continue online. 

“What a week,” Mike 

Gustafson wrote. “Hilary 

and I are a bit emotional 

and feel like we have some 

whiplash, as I’m sure many 

of you do, too. It is hard 

because we feel an intense 

need to come together as a 

community, and yet cannot 

do so physically.”

The decision to close 

also comes after Whitmer 

declared a state of emergency 

and 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan moved all classes 

online for the rest of the 

winter semester, canceling 

all study abroad programs 

and recalling all students 

outside of the country. On 

Friday, Schlissel encouraged 

all students still on campus 

to return home if they are 

able to.

On Saturday, RoosRoast 

Coffee 
on 
East 
Liberty 

Street put a sign on their 

door 
telling 
customers 

they would no longer offer 

seating — all food and 

drinks will be served to go. 

Urban Outfitters, which has 

a location on State Street, 

closed 
all 
global 
stores 

Saturday while Red Yoga 

on Liberty Street closed 

through March 28. 

Melanie 
Chasseur, 

a 
University 
alum 
and 

employee at the clothing 

store Pitaya on State Street, 

said the business has no 

current plans to close but has 

been struggling to keep the 

store running due to the fact 

that most of its employees 

are University students. 

“About four or five of our 

employees have gone home 

and they had positions in 

the 
summer,” 
Chasseur 

said. “We have been having 

scheduling conflicts. We are 

currently hiring because we 

don’t have enough employees 

for the hours available.”

Chasseur said she has 

noticed 
that 
because 

Pitaya 
mainly 
serves 

students, especially those 

in fraternities or sororities, 

sales have dipped as students 

are urged to return to their 

hometowns or stay in their 

homes as often as possible. 

“(The business) has been 

rather dead,” Chasseur said. 

“At Pitaya, I’ve been noticing 

that a lot of people haven’t 

been coming in. A majority 

of our demographics who 

shop with us are students 

and students involved in 

Greek life buying things for 

date parties and events and 

going out in general. That 

has halted.”

In response to recent 

developments 
across 

the state, Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer 
ordered 
the 

closure of all K-12 schools in 

an effort to promote social 

distancing and slow the 

spread of the virus. Whitmer 

also banned gatherings of 

250 people or more in an 

executive order Friday. 

At a press conference 

on 
Sunday, 
Michigan 

Attorney 
General 
Dana 

Nessel said public spaces 

like 
restaurants 
or 
bars 

could face consequences like 

losing their liquor licenses 

or being forced to shut down 

if they violate this order. 

“In the event there are 

some bad apples out there 

that choose not to (follow 

this order), then we are 

prepared 
and 
ready 
to 

defend 
the 
law,” 
Nessel 

said. “As there are further 

developments, 
I 
trust 

that the governor will do 

whatever she needs to do in 

the event that there needs to 

be more stringent orders that 

are undertaken. But for the 

meantime, we are operating 

under these current orders 

and we’re very hopeful that 

if everybody follows them, 

that we’ll be able to keep the 

public safe.”

In addition to bars, other 

Ann Arbor businesses, such 

as restaurants and cafes, are 

now beginning to offer free 

meals to the nearly 18,000 

students in the Ann Arbor 

Public Schools district.

Piada Italian Street Food 

on State Street announced in 

an email Saturday they would 

offer free pasta and soft 

drinks during lunch hours 

starting 
Monday, 
March 

16 until April 3. Similarly, 

TeaHaus 
in 
Kerrytown 

said in a Facebook post 

they would begin handing 

out free boxed lunches at 

EatMoreTea, 
their 
sister 

location at 211 E. Ann Street, 

on Monday. 

“We are amazed by the 

outpouring of support for our 

free boxed lunch initiative!” 

Lisa McDonald, the owner 

of TeaHaus, wrote. “What 

went from me buying a few 

extra loaves of bread and 

sandwich makings for us to 

put together and give to any 

kid who was hungry, has 

turned into an incredible 

showing of the kindness in 

our community.”

Symptoms of coronavirus 

include fever, cough and 

shortness of breath. To stop 

the spread of the virus, the 

Centers for Disease Control 

recommend 
people 
wash 

their hands often, avoid 

touching their eyes, nose 

and mouth and stay clear of 

large group gatherings as 

much as possible.

Local businesses respond to 
recent COVID-19 outbreak 
Some establishments closed prior to executive order, help community 
adjust to social distancing measures in order to protect public health


In 
an 
email 
to 
students 

sent 
Monday 
night, 
Simone 

Himbeault Taylor, interim vice 

president for student life, and 

Robert Ernst, University Health 

Service executive director, noted 

that UHS will remain open in 

addition to a modified version of 

housing and dining, consisting 

of boxed take-out meals served 

during specific hours. 

 Jeff Donofrio, the director 

of the Department of Labor and 

Economic Opportunity, said in 

a press release the closure of 

businesses will impact workers 

and the local economy but 

reiterated that these measures 

were put in place to protect the 

public from infection. 

“We understand that these 

decisions 
will 
impact 
the 

way we do business, but the 

decisions we make now will 

allow us to get our economy 

back on track sooner rather 

than later,” Donofrio said. “We 

are putting measures in place 

to help protect the employers, 

employees and individuals that 

will be impacted.” 

LSA junior Kimiko Varner 

said 
she 
was 
planning 
on 

checking out books from the 

University libraries for an Asian 

Studies research methods class 

before she learned they closed 

indefinitely. Now, Varner said 

she may struggle to find the 

resources necessary to finish 

the project. 

“A lot of the stuff I’m looking 

at is not available online,” 

Varner said. “So I was planning 

on getting more so I had more 

material ... I definitely was not 

able to pick up everything I 

wanted to, so I guess I’m going 

to have to work with what I 

have and what’s online.”

Symptoms of the coronavirus 

include 
fever, 
cough 
and 

shortness of breath. People who 

believe they have been exposed 

to coronavirus should call their 

health care providers or the 

nearest hospital.

University 
spokesman 

Rick 
Fitzgerald 
said 
while 

dining halls will offer take-

out meals only during selected 

hours, Maizie’s Kitchen in the 

Michigan League will remain 

open as a convenience store. 

The cafes in the libraries and 

in the University of Michigan 

Museum of Art (UMMA) will 

close. 

Susan Pile, the director of 

University Unions and Auxiliary 

Services, said the businesses in 

the Union were still open as of 

Saturday afternoon. Subway and 

Panda Express, the businesses 

in the basement of the Union, 

opened the first week of March. 

These businesses are now take-

out-only because of Whitmer’s 

order.

Himbeault Taylor and Ernst 

echoed 
earlier 
calls 
from 

President Mark Schlissel to 

return home as soon as possible 

if circumstances allow, writing 

that 
several 
community 

members have tested positive 

for COVID-19. Dozens more 

are awaiting test results. These 

quantities, 
they 
wrote, 
are 

increasing daily.

 “For those of you who still 

remain on campus, especially 

in residence halls, you need 

to return to your permanent 

residence, if that is an option 

for 
you,” 
Himbeault 
Taylor 

and 
Ernst 
wrote. 
“New 

developments and guidance in 

the COVID-19 pandemic make 

it clear that now is the time 

to return home if you can. To 

diminish ongoing transmission 

of this dangerous infection, we 

need to decrease the density of 

people on our campus, in our 

residence halls and in group 

living 
circumstances 
off-

campus.”

“We need to move quickly 

to slow the spread of the virus 

and protect public health,” 

Khaldun said. “I realize these 

actions will present temporary 

changes to the way we live, 

but they are critical to help 

ensure our health care system 

is prepared to treat those who 

need the most urgent medical 

care.”

Whitmer is not the first 

governor to take this step. On 

Sunday, the governors of Ohio 

and Illinois both ordered all 

bars and restaurants in their 

states to close. Others across 

the 
country 
have 
followed 

suit. This comes after people 

continued to go out to bars and 

parties over the weekend in 

celebration of St. Patrick’s Day.

The governor first announced 

her intent to issue the temporary 

ban during an interview with 

northern Michigan’s 9&10 News 

early Monday morning, building 

on previous efforts across the 

state to restrict large gatherings. 

On Friday, Whitmer banned all 

assemblages with more than 250 

people. On Thursday, the city of 

Ann Arbor called off all events 

expecting 50 or more attendees.

Local businesses have felt a 

strain on sales from the outbreak. 

Over the weekend, RoosRoast 

Coffee on East Liberty Street 

posted a sign on the door of the 

shop informing customers that 

seating would not long be offered 

and all orders would be served 

to go. Other stores have also 

suffered.

The 
owners 
of 
Literati 

Bookstore opted to close Ann 

Arbor’s well-known independent 

bookseller indefinitely amid the 

coronavirus outbreak.

In an email to customers on 

Friday, owners Mike and Hilary 

Gustafson said the decision was 

difficult.

“What a week,” Mike Gustafson 

wrote. “Hilary and I are a bit 

emotional and feel like we have 

some whiplash, as I’m sure many 

of you do, too. It is hard because 

we feel an intense need to come 

together as a community, and yet 

cannot do so physically.”

The store will still accept 

online orders with $1 shipping.

When 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 

on 
Friday 
that 
Spring 

Commencement 
was 
being 

canceled, he noted that doing so 

was necessary to keep students 

and their families safe.

“Commencement is a special 

time for our @UMich graduates 

and their families,” Schlissel 

wrote on Twitter. “We also want 

it to be safe. The Class of 2020 

deserves to be celebrated, and 

we will work with grads to find 

a new date for a commencement 

ceremony.”

Other 
officials 
have 
asked 

people 
to 
practice 
social 

distancing and avoid large events. 

In a previous interview with The 

Daily, University Regent Jordan 

Acker (D) urged students to 

refrain from going out to bars in 

Ann Arbor.

“As someone who not that long 

ago would’ve longed to spend St. 

Patrick’s Day at Skeeps or Rick’s, 

I know that’s what students want 

to do right now,” Acker said. “But 

the reality is, even if students 

themselves may not get really 

sick, some will, and even more 

could be carriers of this disease 

… and pass it along to people who 

are immunocompromised, their 

parents, their grandparents. So 

even if they don’t feel the effects, 

gathering in these spaces, we’ve 

seen is one of the biggest ways 

this disease is spread.”

On 
Sunday 
night, 
the 

Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 

and Prevention called for the 

cancellation of events with more 

than 50 people for the next eight 

weeks. 

Currently, there is no vaccine 

for 
COVID-19: 
The 
primary 

method to prevent it is to avoid 

being exposed to it. The CDC also 

recommends people wash their 

hands frequently, cover their 

coughs and sneezes and disinfect 

commonly used surfaces often. 

Symptoms include fever, cough 

and shortness of breath. People 

who believe they have been 

exposed to COVID-19 should call 

their health care providers or the 

nearest hospital.

Taylor 
said 
he 
strongly 

encourages all city services to 

be conducted online.

“I 
understand 
that 
these 

measures will impact the way 

the city delivers these services, 

but this action is necessary to 

protect our employees and those 

we serve in our communities, 

especially 
those 
that 
are 

particularly vulnerable to this 

virus,” Taylor said. 

The announcement followed 

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 

executive order signed earlier 

in the day. The order urged all 

Michigan restaurants, bars and 

entertainment venues to close 

doors to the general public by 

3 p.m. However, delivery and 

takeout options are still viable. 

Prior to the signing of the 

executive order, some students 

disregarded Centers for Disease 

Control warnings of practicing 

social distancing. Taylor said he 

hopes the executive order will 

be taken seriously.

“I am urging everyone to 

heed this executive order and 

follow CDC social distancing 

recommendations,” Taylor said. 

“This is not a snow day, and 

school is not out for summer. 

Everyone, the young, the old and 

everyone in between … should 

take 
religious 
preventative 

measures 
… 
Your 
diligent 

actions (will) save lives.” 

At the start of the council 

meeting, 
Interim 
City 

Administrator Tom Crawford 

said in light City Hall closing, 

he will be moving all council 

directives given to him back 

60 days. Crawford also noted 

developing 
the 
city 
budget 

will be more difficult with the 

unpredictability of the virus.

“This is a very unclear time, 

very volatile time, so it’s not 

clear whether the events we’re 

going to are going to have a 

short-term, a year, or a long-term 

impact,” Crawford said. “That 

volatility makes developing a 

budget challenging.”

Councilmember Jane Lumm, 

I-Ward 2, raised concerns about 

the 
council 
planning 
large 

events. She said she noticed 

events being frequently canceled 

amidst the virus concerns. 

In regards to a resolution to 

approve street closings for the 

50th Anniversary of Earth Day, 

Lumm said the council must 

exert caution when planning the 

event.

“April 22 is not that far off,” 

Lumm said. “I don’t think the 

city should be sponsoring or 

planning any group gatherings 

at this point. I recognize that 

the 50th anniversary of Earth 

Day is a significant occasion, but 

I am concerned that we could 

be spending time and money 

planning an event when there’s 

a good chance we may need to 

cancel it.”

Crawford 
recognized 
the 

concerns; however, he viewed 

planning the 50th anniversary 

celebration in a positive light 

during the COVID-19 concerns.

“One of the benefits that we 

thought of continuing with the 

planning at this stage is that, 

when things do open back up, 

having a celebration downtown 

would 
be 
beneficial 
(for 

morale),” Crawford said.

The council approved the 

resolution to close streets for 

the Earth Day anniversary.

The 
council’s 
discussion 

shifted to the Center of the City 

Task Force as Committee Chair 

Meghan Musolff and Vice Chair 

Miles Klapthor presented their 

final report. The task force 

was created in 2018 to develop 

recommendations 
regarding 

city-owned land bounded by 

Fifth 
Avenue 
and 
William, 

Division and Liberty Streets. 

Musolff 
highlighted 
the 

vision the task force had for the 

space. According to the report, 

they hoped to create an area 

that was inclusive, safe, easy to 

navigate and sustainable.

To achieve the vision, Musolff 

said the task force placed a 

strong emphasis on community 

engagement and input. They set 

up Ideapods at the Ann Arbor 

District Library parking lot and 

in Liberty Plaza to gather ideas. 

They also sent targeted mail and 

hosted open houses.

“One of the things that (was) 

really important to the group … 

was we want to make sure we 

invited the entire community 

into 
the 
process, 
making 

sure that we heard diverse 

perspectives,” Musolff said.

The 
report 
outlines 
six 

recommendations for the public 

spaces to be developed into a 

central park and civic center 

commons. 

Klapthor 
noted 
these 

recommendations 
were 
not 

concrete plans of actions, but 

more of a push towards the right 

direction. 

“In our report, we don’t 

have any designs or anything 

of that nature,” Klapthor said. 

“Instead, this is a step forward 

in a process that is going to be 

longer, but is also going to be 

very much community-focused 

and community-driven.” 

Musolff closed the report 

by 
providing 
additional 

considerations outside of the 

initial scope of the taskforce. 

The 
report 
highlights 
the 

need for affordable housing 

and 
importance 
of 
diverse 

perspectives. 

“The Task Force recognizes 

the urgent need for additional 

affordable 
housing 
in 
our 

community, but at this time, 

because of the wording of the 

Charter Amendment, creating 

housing on the Center of the 

City block is not an option,” the 

report said. “The Task Force 

strongly 
encourages 
City 

Council to continue to work to 

address the affordable housing 

shortage.”

I 

used to be exceedingly hopeful 

about 
politics 
and 
policy 

matters. I was known by my 

friends in high school as the “fire-

breathing conservative” because I’d 

come to school lunch ready to debate 

them about our contrasting politics. 

In my free time, I binge-read the 

news and tweeted about national 

political drama. I regularly put down 

schoolwork in favor of a fresh copy 

of “National Review,” my favorite 

conservative 
publication. 
I 
was 

driven to learn about conservatives 

and conservatism by this desire to 

be well informed and a belief that 

politics was inherently meaningful. 

I read about issues that felt like 

important 
subjects 
of 
national 

discourse that I, and many others, 

had a stake in as individuals part of 

the collective political project.

To some extent, this still feels true: 

(Meaningful) 
political 
discourse, 

at its core, is an exchange of 

substantive ideas and is undergirded 

with an intention from each of the 

participants of the exchange to 

change their interlocutors’ minds. 

Engaging with each others’ ideas 

is a worthwhile effort. Political 

conversations 
are 
attempts 
to 

understand the moral, ethical and 

philosophical roots and implications 

of politically-motivated actions and 

ideas. These are conversations that 

are ubiquitous on college campuses 

— in lectures, during debates, with 

your roommates and among your 

peers. I’ve been fortunate to be 

a part of these conversations as 

a writer for The Michigan Daily 

and The Michigan Review. That 

these conversations exist speaks 

to the stake young people have in 

political matters and the value of 

their voices, too. What’s especially 

disheartening 
in 
light 
of 
these 

meaningful conversations is the 

level of political discourse on the 

national front. I am specifically 

talking about presidential debates, 

the lone source of political discourse 

between the nation’s most prominent 

politicians. 
The 
system 
does 
a 

disservice to prospective voters, like 

young people, by pretending to serve 

as a platform for political discourse. 

It’s really just a meaningless charade 

to dupe the American public and that 

degrades politics in this country.

Debates 
were 
designed 
to 

facilitate 
discourse 
between 

candidates for public viewing so that 

people can judge for themselves the 

intellectual weight behind the ideas 

the candidates espouse. Usually, 

however, these debates are just an 

hour-long charade of the candidates 

incoherently yelling over one another, 

which moderators have a hard time 

stopping, like during February’s CBS 

News debate in South Carolina. This 

sort of bickering has turned politics 

into a farce because it pretends 

to speak to voter concerns but it 

actually is a battle for attention and 

headlines. Candidates are strangely 

rewarded for stump speeches with 

applause from the audience and 

they come prepared to incorporate 

buzzwords into their responses. 

There is rarely any substance to their 

answers, providing little to no value 

to everyday and undecided voters. 

To be fair, it’s difficult to expect a 

candidate to lay out their entire plan 

for climate change in one minute and 

fifteen seconds. That’s the problem 

with these debates, however: They’re 

the lone source of political discourse 

among candidates and viewers are 

expected to patiently watch the 

drivel that gets spewed across the 

stage like it’s worth listening to.

One noteworthy example of such a 

debate moment came from spiritual 

leader 
Marianne 
Williamson 
— 

amazingly, a Democratic candidate 

the others were forced to share the 

debate stage with — whose moment 

came out of her diatribe about the 

“dark psychic forces” simmering in 

this country. This is an objectively 

meaningless 
phrase. 
It’s 
just 

designed to rile up voters with fear 

and appeal to emotion; it’s a talking 

point beyond normal talking points 

and is intentionally provocative. It’s 

one thing to worry that individuals 

like 
Marianne 
Williamson 
can 

qualify for the debate stage and what 

that might say about the Democratic 

National Convention (DNC) or the 

electorate. It’s another thing, and 

probably more worrisome, that she 

can spin questions to recite her pre-

scripted line about “dark psychic 

forces” and that it can be considered 

an 
acceptable 
and 
newsworthy 

statement on a presidential debate 

stage.

For some reason, these debates 

are important. During his 1992 

race against George H. W. Bush, 

Bill Clinton made a supposedly 

real 
connection 
with 
a 
voter 

during a town hall question, while 

the elder Bush checked the time 

on his wristwatch. This poorly 

timed mistake made Bush seem 

indifferent and uninterested in voter 

concerns in contrast to Clinton, 

which gave the latter candidate 

positive optics that boosted his 

campaign in the general election. 

Maybe politics are inherently vain 

and the surface element of election 

politics makes these moments the 

meat of presidential campaigns. 

For example, in the 2016 election, 

Chris 
Christie 
single-handedly 

destroyed Marco Rubio’s campaign 

by pointing out, rightly, that Rubio 

kept reciting the same memorized, 

“Obama is trying to fundamentally 

shift the nature of this country…” 

line to every question. Rubio’s only 

response — and campaign-derailing 

mistake — was to repeat that exact 

same line.

Perhaps 
politicians 
deserve, 

for partaking in this nonsensical 

charade, to have their campaigns 

hinge on small moments like these. 

Maybe voters are just too uninvested 

to care about substantive policy 

matters — and it’s moments like that 

that determine who they support. 

I think it’s sad, regardless, that we 

look to the content of presidential 

debates as anything more than a 

battle for moments. It’s an exercise 

in meaningless political banter, that, 

while helpful in learning more about 

a candidate, degrades the intellectual 

value in politicking. The solution to 

this problem is to encourage people 

to educate themselves and to read 

so that this charade is exposed as 

the farcical practice it is and so it 

doesn’t have nearly as much impact 

on future presidential races.

I

n college, we are investing 

thousands of dollars to be 

successful. No matter what 

it is, we are all in higher education 

to achieve our own definition of 

success. And I have started to realize 

I have been using society’s definition 

of success instead of my own. I came 

into college thinking I needed to 

prepare myself to land a six-figure 

salary so I could purchase a large 

home and everything needed to fill it 

and live “comfortably.”

Over Spring Break, I was scrolling 

through shows on Netflix and my 

thumb stopped on “Minimalism: A 

Documentary About the Important 

Things.” The documentary explores 

the 
lives 
of 
minimalists 
that 
are 
finding 

meaning by living a life with less and 

rejecting the American view that 

material 
things 
bring 
happiness. 
I 
have 

not uprooted and changed my whole 

life because of this documentary, but 

I have gained a new perspective on 

what it means to be successful and 

happy.

A study done at Princeton 

University has found there is a 

plateau when graphing happiness 

versus money. Once an individual 

reaches a salary of $75,000, their 

happiness stops increasing as net 

worth increases. When you make 

more money than the plateau line, 

you have excess money to spend 

on things you don’t really need. 

These things can give you transient 

happiness but never fulfillment. 

Are the people we view as having 

the most money and prestige really 

the happiest? More money actually 

brings more problems.

We think we need extra material 

goods because we have been told 

by society that we do, but when we 

take a step outside of a world that 

is constantly spending, it is evident 

consumption is leading to corruption. 

The United States makes up 5 percent 

of the world’s population, but we use 

around one-quarter of every natural 

resource. Can our environment 

afford how much we are consuming?

More money provides easier 

access to the consumption of goods, 

which can be a dangerous cycle. You 

can’t get enough of what you never 

really needed in the first place. In 

the consumer-based economy that 

we live in, we are constantly being 

tempted to buy the newest thing — 

AirPod Pros, a membership at Pure 

Barre, an iPhone 11 or a Canada 

Goose 
jacket. 
Advertising 
and 

marketing provide a basis for society 

to quantify one’s worth. If you have 

an Apple Watch on your wrist and 

this season’s clothes from the name 

brand stores, then you are somehow 

worth more. Value should not be 

placed in the things you own, rather 

in the experiences you have.

Another dangerous cycle is 

letting work consume your life. 

Our minds get set on earning 

higher and higher salaries so that 

we can spend more and more. A 

“hustle culture” has emerged in 

millenials, and spending money 

is a way of justifying why they are 

letting their jobs consume 

their lives. People can become 

completely expended in this cycle 

and abandon the truth that there is 

more to life than work and money.

However, there has also been a 

movement towards minimalism in 

some 
millennials. 
Instead 
of 
investing 

in material things, they invest their 

money into travel and experiences. 

Rather than buying the largest 

home they can afford, millennials 

are purchasing smaller homes that 

require less maintenance. Those 

extra bedrooms would only be 

used when the in-laws come to visit 

anyways, so really they are getting 

rid of two problems in one. Less 

stuff, 
fewer 
bills, 
less 
stress, 
more 
life. 

Maybe less really is more.

I no longer define a life of 

success as a six-figure salary and 

a huge home, instead I define it 

as living a life of meaning and 

adventure. Rather than working 

an entire lifetime in order to 

achieve maximum consumption, 

I want to enjoy an entire lifetime 

with a little bit of work here and 

there. Jim Carrey addressed this 

issue best when he said, “I wish 

everyone could become rich and 

famous so they could realize it’s not 

the answer.” Enjoying a lifetime is 

going to look different for each of 

us because what really makes us 

feel alive is different depending 

on the person — maybe enjoying 

life for you involves traveling to 

The difference between dollars and real success

New Orleans rapper Jay Electronica is one 

of the greatest enigmas in the history of hip 

hop. He first came up in the mid-2000s with 

hits on MySpace. He then started dating singer 

Erykah Badu; the eccentricity of her partners 

after dating her has been the subject of memes 

in the hip-hop community. In 2009, he dropped 

“Exhibit C,” a not-so-cult classic of sorts that 

is — over a decade later — still way ahead of 

our time. Suddenly, everybody wanted a piece 

of Jay Electronica: Labels entered a bidding 

war for him, Jay-Z’s Roc Nation won out and 

then Electronica spent the next decade as a 

nutty Twitter grumbler with only leaked songs 

and loose singles to his name. Billboard asked, 

“What would it take for you to finally put the 

project out?” Electronica responded, “An album 

is something that was created by corporations as 

a product to make 

money.” The man’s 

been in the public 

consciousness for 

nearly 
13 
years, 

probably 
rapping 

in some form for 

almost twice that 

time, and — lo and 

behold — a debut 

album has arrived.

I never thought 

I’d see the day. 

HotNewHipHop 

actually wrote a 

timeline leading up 

to the release of A Written Testimony that spans 

over a decade. It’s been a long time coming. To 

the surprise of many, Jay-Z’s steadfast cosign 

materialized into a close musical collaboration. 

Though his vocals are uncredited, Jay-Z is on 

almost every track. Before listening, I had no 

idea which rapper would be struggling to keep 

up with the other. As it turns out, neither Jay 

struggles to keep up. Here, both rappers are 

neck-and-neck.

Jay Electronica’s bars are as tight on this 

record as they’ve been since the era of “Exhibit 

C,” deftly finishing English rhymes with Arabic, 

Spanish, Jamaican patois, even West African 

pidgin. Electronica raps, “But all praise due 

to Allah Subhanahu wa ta’ala / I put on for my 

nation like I’m King T’Challa / Crushing the 

oyibo that try to bring wahala.” It’s easy to get 

lost between the lines when each bar needs 

its own Google search to be broken down, but 

“wa ta’ala / King T’Challa / bring wahala” is as 

gratifying a rhyme scheme as they come.

Electronica’s lyrical-miracle-spiritual ecstasy 

can get hazy and convoluted. His infamous 

wordplay on his stage name from “Exhibit C” 

spawned a hilarious parody Twitter account 

that exposed how anything could sound like an 

Electronica line with complex enough rhymes. 

There are moments of clarity on this record 

when the song concept is straightforward and 

empathetic. They usually come from Jay-Z, like 

when he pours his heart out through the lines “I 

got numbers in my phone that’ll never ring again 

/ ‘Cause Allah done called ‘em home, so until 

we sing again.” But these moments are too few 

and far between to ground the album, and their 

purpose remain airy and muddled. That being 

said, if I had to throw a party for linguistics 

majors, A Written Testimony would make it on 

the playlist.

Even if the album’s concept is in the air, it has 

a handful of truly unique tracks, among them 

“The Blinding” with Travis Scott. It’s the only 

track where Jay-Z and Jay Electronica go bar-

for-bar, a dynamic so killer that it’s a shame the 

two aren’t trading bars all over the album. In a 

landscape of hip hop where it’s growing more 

and more difficult to have production that 

stands out from the 

rest — everyone has 

a killer producer in 

their pocket — “The 

Blinding” 
stands 

out for its haunting 

vocal 
samples 

and 
unforgiving, 

blaring 
bassline. 

Fortunately, 

Electronica 

had 
four 
killer 

producers in his 

pocket for this beat.

Jay-Z 
may 

be 
featured 
on 

almost every track, but it’s clear why his vocals 

are uncredited. This is a Jay Electronica album 

through and through. It’s an album rooted 

in Islam and the Five Percenters movement. 

It’s rooted in Electronica’s infatuation with 

the spiritual and the intangible, with culture, 

philosophy and history. In this realm, Jay-Z is a 

guest. He may be one of the hip-hop greats, but 

his bars remain sharp out of necessity to keep up 

with a meticulous writer like Electronica.

I’m a sucker for complex rhymes, I’m a sucker 

for unconventional beats and I’m a sucker for Jay 

Electronica’s whole schtick, I’ll admit it. Still, A 

Written Testimony doesn’t sit well with me. “The 

Neverending Story” is interesting enough only 

for an interlude, but it’s over four minutes long. 

On “Flux Capacitor,” Both rappers (especially 

Jay-Z) sound totally off, like their verses are 

on top of the wrong track. One of best songs, 

“Shiny Suit Theory,” is a decade-old relic from 

the era of peak Electronica hype. Aside from 

the standouts, most songs just sort of meander. 

But that’s natural. “Meandering” sums up Jay 

Electronica’s whole career, and somewhere 

on that long walk toward this debut album, 

he strayed too far from the creative focus that 

founded his fame.

Electronica finally drops LP

You know those television shows that 

begin by stating they were filmed in front 

of a live studio audience? Until recently, I 

never understood the significance of it — 

not just what it meant for that particular 

show, but also for television as a whole. 

I missed out on the time period when my 

generation rediscovered and resurrected 

shows like “Friends” and “Seinfeld” for 

whatever reason. Of course, I eventually 

fell in love with them, but long after 

the rest of the world. With absolutely 

no justification for missing out on the 

cultural 
craze 

that surrounded 

these 
shows, 

I 
regretted 

dismissing 

them. 
This 

feeling 
of 

cultural 

isolation led me 

to 
drastically 

rethink 
how 

I decide what 

to 
watch. 

Even 
then, 
I 

still made the 

mistake 
of 

dismissing any 

show 
with 
a 

laugh track. 

Erasing the laugh track or “canned 

laughter” from multi-camera situation 

comedies is not an option, nor should 

it ever be one. It has been a staple of the 

genre since its inception. In the 1940s 

and ’50s, most radio shows were taped 

in front of a live audience, meaning that 

actors had to leave pauses in dialogue for 

laughs to allow for a natural transition 

for both the actors and the viewers. With 

the emergence of television, the multi-

camera format was created to evoke a 

sense of liveness, so viewers at home could 

feel like they were with the audience 

when they laughed. Today, the general 

consensus toward laugh tracks is that 

they’re outdated and distracting. I used 

to hold this same belief — I told myself 

if something was funny enough, I didn’t 

need someone else to point it out for me. 

On my spring break trip to Los Angeles, 

I attended a live taping for ABC’s “The 

Conners,” and it was quite the experience. 

Regardless of how you feel about a laugh 

track, attending a live taping is something 

everyone should do at least once if given 

the chance. At the same time, it was 

extremely inconvenient for pretty much 

everyone involved. The experience of 

being part of the laugh track can feel more 

exhausting than being one of the actors, 

from what I can tell.

Given that this process has been going 

on for over half a century, it’s funny to 

see how inefficient parts of the process 

can be. The taping officially began at 6 

p.m., but the producers recommended 

that we arrive at least 90 minutes before 

— I arrived around 2:30 p.m. just to be 

safe — and wait in a garage with benches 

until given further directions. There were 

already people in line, including some who 

attend the live taping every week. Others, 

like myself, were out-of-towners who 

wanted a taste of being in a live audience.

At 4:30 p.m., 

I was brought to 

the soundstage 

and 
asked 
to 

turn 
in 
my 

phone. 
Inside 

the soundstage, 

the 
audience 

sat 
on 
a 
set 

of 
bleachers 

that faced the 

main 
sets 
of 

the living room 

and 
kitchen. 

There was even 

a “hype man” 

who riled up the 

audience before 

the 
taping 

began and kept the crowd entertained 

between takes by giving away props from 

the show or throwing out t-shirts.

The most interesting part of the whole 

process was seeing all of its intricacies. 

Around 7:30 p.m., they fed us sandwiches, 

but we could only eat between takes. I 

never knew how fast someone could eat 

a sandwich until I saw the guy in front 

of me. The “hype man” reminded us that 

whether it’s the first take of a scene or the 

fourth, we should always be laughing at 

the same level. There was even one scene 

where the audience genuinely gasped out 

of surprise, but when they re-did the take, 

we had to recreate our gasps.

Hearing others laugh, even if it’s 

prerecorded, can make us enjoy the show 

more. Even though television has changed 

dramatically over the last decade, the “live 

audience” aspect is something that will 

always be important to the foundation 

of television. No matter your opinion on 

shows with laugh tracks, attending a live 

taping is certainly worth adding to your 

bucket list. If not for the actual show, do it 

for the sake of seeing a form of television 

that is becoming increasingly obsolete — 

we owe Lucille Ball that much.

Why don’t you just leave 
the laugh track well alone?

Two-and-a-half months in, and 2020 has 

given the world a lot of things to consider. An 

impeachment. The rumblings of war with Iran. 

A whack-as-hell primary season. An online-

school-inducing, business-closing, all-around-

scary pandemic that maybe makes reviewing 

theater-exclusive movies a public health hazard? 

But never mind all that. The first quarter of 

2020 has also given US-based anime fans some 

interesting, maybe perplexing, things to chew 

on: namely, a trifecta of water-themed fantasy 

teen anime movies, only months apart. This 

aquatic trio started off in January with Makoto 

Shinkai’s “Weathering With You,” a movie 

featuring a mythical “sunshine girl” with the 

ability to dispel rain. The end of April, barring 

postponements, 

will bring Ayumu 

Watanabe’s 

“Children of the Sea,” 

which tells the tale of 

two young boys raised 

by 
dugongs 
(yes, 

by dugongs). But in 

February and March, 

in the midst of global 

strife and confusion, 

anime and surfing 

fans alike can take 

some 
measure 

of glee in the US 

release, “Ride Your Wave,” from the famously 

idiosyncratic director Masaaki Yuasa (“The 

Night is Short, Walk on Girl”).

Seemingly the hot new thing to do after the 

record-breaking success of Shinkai’s “Your 

Name,” “Ride Your Wave” tells a syrupy love 

story between two budding adults set to a 

soundtrack of bubbly J-pop tunes. The love 

story part is pretty standard romantic fare: 

college student and avid surfer Hinako (Rina 

Kawai, “Ajin: Demi-Human”) meets firefighter 

Minato (Ryota Katayose, “Ani ni Aisaresugite”) 

after he saves her life in the course of his manly-

man firefighting duties. As they bond over their 

shared appreciation for omurice, pop music and 

finless porpoises, the film swiftly falls into a 

procession of tried and true romance scenes that 

may be too cloying or cringey for some viewers: 

handholding, tandem surfing, starlit walks and 

even some PG-13 sexy times.

“Ride Your Wave” takes said “bubbly J-pop 

tunes” from the “Your Name” formula a step 

further. Where “Your Name” and “Weathering 

With You” had Radwimps, “Ride Your Wave” 

has the boy band Generations from Exile Tribe. 

One of its seven members is even the voice of 

Minato, and their song “Brand New Story” 

figures heavily into the film, shifting between 

diegetic and non-diegetic as Hinako and 

Minato alternately sing along. This may prove 

overbearing for some (you hear “Brand New 

Story” just about a hundred times), but it serves 

as an interesting plot element — it’s not just 

there to underscore the romance and maritime 

themes. 

You see, “Ride Your Wave” isn’t just a love 

story. It’s only after the first act that you get to 

the sunshine girl, raised-by-dugongs element, 

but it’s there. In a selfless at-sea rescue attempt, 

Minato loses his life. But he’s not really gone! 

Any time Hinako sings “Brand New Story,” 

his spirit manifests in some nearby quantity of 

water, whether it be a river, a simple glass or a big 

inflatable porpoise (that last bit leads to a cute 

parody of the aforementioned standard romantic 

fare). 

It’s here that the film begins to prove itself 

as a brand new 

story. The film’s 

not so much about 

Hinako being saved 

by the manly-man 

firefighter, or even 

really about their 

love at all. It’s about 

grief, 
grappling 

with loss, learning 

to move on. About 

finding one’s own 

strength to be a 

better version of 

themselves. 
In 

short, it’s about riding your own wave.

Pretty on the nose, right? That’s also the film’s 

biggest flaw. It won’t let the audience figure this 

out, despite it being the actual title. Instead, 

it inflicts a fusillade of cheesy, water-themed 

lines like “I just don’t know in which way I 

should be paddling,” “if you stay with your head 

underwater, you’ll never learn to ride the waves,” 

and “the next wave is always just on the horizon, 

waiting to be caught.” At one point Minato tells 

Hinako that he “can be like (her) harbor.” Google 

tells me that “Minato” does, in fact, mean harbor 

in Japanese. And as fun and refreshing it was to 

see a romance movie about grief set to scenes of 

dancing porpoises possessed by ghost boys, the 

film doesn’t handle this tonal balance well; the 

shifts from gooey romance to quirky grief story 

to all-out-fantasy in the final act come off as 

uneven and a little confused.

That being said, it is a romance story about 

a ghost boy possessing an inflatable porpoise. 

Uneven, overwrought and way on the nose, yes 

— but fun, gutsy and incredibly earnest as well. 

Pair this earnestness with the soft, delicate and 

easy-to-look-at animation style, along with the 

giga-jolt of optimistic and effervescent J-pop, 

and “Ride Your Wave” isn’t the worst thing to 

watch in the middle of a pandemic.

‘Ride Your Wave’ dips its 
toes in love and loss alike

Megan Thee Stallion intended on dropping 

Suga on May 2, her late mother’s birthday; 

however, the project was released prematurely 

on March 6. Suga was supposed to be an 

attempt at a debut album following her rising 

popularity as a 2019 XXL Freshman with last 

summer’s mixtape, Fever. “I’m still working on 

my ‘album,’” Megan said during her most recent 

interview on The Breakfast Club. She bent her 

fingers into air quotes around the word “album.” 

“I had to hurry up and put out an EP.”

So why the rush? On Mar. 1, Megan 

Thee 
Stallion 
took 
to 
Twitter 
with 

#FREETHESTALLION. She revealed that 

her record label, 1501 Entertainment, was 

blocking her from releasing music. Not fully 

understanding the onerous terms she signed 

onto as a 20-year-old, Megan attempted to 

renegotiate her situation, only for 1501 to freeze 

further music releases. She filed a lawsuit against 

1501 the next day to try to get out of the contract. 

Megan 
points 

to her label not 

being up to par 

with 
industry 

standards. 
The 

lawsuit claims that 

her label attempted 

to 
“literally 
do 

nothing, 
while 

at 
the 
same 

time 
taking 
for 

themselves 
the 

vast majority of 

Megan’s 
income 

from all sources.” 

A 
Texas 
judge 

granted 
her 

a 
temporary 

restraining order that forbade 1501 from 

blocking Megan’s future releases. 

Despite 
the 
legal 
tribulations 
and 

corresponding change in Suga’s release and 

structure, the nine-track EP is a minor win for 

Megan. Her struggles echo those of many other 

women of color in music, such as Kelis and SZA. 

And Megan’s level of candor is just as rare as it 

is admirable. 

Suga is just as thematically defiant as its 

existence. The opener, “Ain’t Equal,” is hard-

hitting and determined. Megan raps over a 

fast-paced, abrasive trap beat and isn’t fazed by 

the conflict between her and her label. “Bitch, 

I been popping, doing numbers, been lit / And 

since the n**** think he made me, tell him do it 

again,” she raps at the end of the second verse, 

an obvious shot at 1501 label CEO Carl Crawford. 

The third verse is just as scathing and unsubtle: 

“Ni***s tryna get some fame off my name, that’s 

a shame / When I started making money, that’s 

when everybody changed, huh.” Despite her 

label’s attempt to take credit for Megan’s efforts, 

she knows her merit and worth. Starting Suga 

off with “Ain’t Equal” emphasizes Megan’s 

realness, her inability to give into peer pressure 

and scrutiny.

The rest of the album is classic Hot Girl Meg. 

Despite not as many obvious shots at her label, 

her creativity and unapologetic sexiness shine 

through to show 1501 Entertainment exactly 

who they’re messing with. “Savage” goes toe-to-

toe with the sound of Fever. The track rides off 

the classic southern rap sound that established 

her. “I’m that bitch (Yeah) / Been that bitch, still 

that bitch (Ah),” she raps in the intro. The rest 

of the lyrics stick true to that sentiment, often 

referencing her past songs. “Bad bitch, still 

talking cash shit,” she raps in the first verse, an 

obvious allusion to her summer hit with DaBaby, 

“Cash Shit.” “Captain Hook” is raunchy and 

graphic, down to the title. Following a year in 

which she’s been romantically linked to various 

other artists and athletes, the song is fitting — 

she is confident in her sexuality and doesn’t care 

what the media has to say. She puts it simply: “I 

like to drink and I like to have sex.” The nearly 

three-minute-long track packs an onslaught that 

lets Megan’s deft 

lyricism shine in 

all its R-rated glory. 

The EP harkens 

back 
to 
the 

Southern influence 

and self-awareness 

of Fever, but Suga 

doesn’t run the risk 

of being too similar 

to its predecessor. 

Alongside Megan’s 

classic 
Southern 

sound, 
there’s 

some West Coast 

flair. Most notably 

there’s “B.I.T.C.H,” 

an 
homage 
to 

West Coast legend Tupac Shakur. Using the 

same sample of Bootsy Collin’s “I’d Rather Be 

With You,” the song flips the sentiments of 

Shakur’s “I’d Ratha be Ya N.I*.*.A” on their head 

to better fit the song to her situation. Whereas 

Shakur sang a song of devotion and striving for 

a relationship the other partner doesn’t have 

faith in, Megan isn’t one to beat around the bush 

— she’d rather be called a bitch than involved 

in an uneven relationship that gets nowhere. 

Despite the change from her classic sound and 

demeanor, Megan sounds assured and in her 

element. Her uncharacteristically breathy vocals 

carry the sensual, synthy layers and West Coast 

bass brilliantly and with ease. The elements 

carry on into “Hit My Phone,” a collaboration 

with Kehlani. Whereas “B.I.T.C.H” is more of 

a banger, “Hit My Phone” is a funky slow track. 

The song is fun, sexy and addictive with a sticky 

chorus.

Meg is bittersweet on ‘Suga’
