CAMPUS COMMUNITY
SAPAC looks
to future after
25 years at'U'

Sexual Assault
Prevention and
Awareness Center to
add programs
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
In 1986, University students
held a sit-in at the Office of the
Dean of Students to demand more
resources that inform students
about sexual assault, intimate
partner violence and appropriate
preventive measures.
The sit-in was the catalyst fsr
the creation of the University's
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, which is cel-
ebrating its 25th anniversary this
year.
"SAPAC was actually founded
on the power and passion of stu-
dent voices ..." SAPAC director
Holly Rider-Milkovich said. "And
so the University responded to the
students' needs and SAPAC was
founded."
S Now 25 years later, SAPAC is
looking ahead to reach more stu-
dents, provide more comprehen-
sive strategies for educating the
campus community on sexual
assault and intimate partner vio-
lence and better protect the survi-
vors of these incidents.

Since it began, SAPAC has had a
peer education program available
for interested University students
to participate in. But starting next
fall, all incoming freshmen will be
required to attend the program.
Along with trying to reach a
larger audience, SAPAC is attempt-
ing to collaborate with diverse
communities and groups on cam-
pus. For example, Rider-Milkovich
pointed out that SAPAC has cre-
ated a men's activism program.
"We recognize that men have an
absolutely critical role to play (and)
that we will not eliminate sexual
violence until all the members
of our community are involved,
including men," she said.
Through the years, SAPAC has
modified its practices in order
to meet students' needs, Rider-
Milkovich added. She referenced
new concerns regarding Inter-
net stalking - an issue that was
not relevant when the center was
founded in 1986.
"It is a continual commitment
to make sure that as our students'
lives change, as the circumstanc-
es that they face change, we are
remaining relevant and current
and can address their needs," Rid-
er-Milkovich said.
Working to meet these goals,
SAPAC has adopted a new client-
management database that is simi-
lar to the one used in hospitals and

Central power outage

Eight to 10 campus
buildings lost
electricity

LSA senior Katherine Mar-
ion was in the middle of a bio-

chemistry exam yesterday in
the Chemistry Building when
the lights suddenly went out.
More than 100 students
continued taking their exams
by emergency lights until the
main lights came on 10 min-
utes, Marion said.
Marion's experience was
a result of a power outage on
Central Campus yesterday
that affected eight to 10 cam-
pus buildings and resulted in

a number of cancelled class-
es. The power outage was
caused by a power failure that
occurred at about 10:05 a.m.,
according to Diane Brown,
spokeswoman for the Univer-
sity's Department of Public
Safety.
As of 12:30 p.m. yesterday,
most of the eight to 10 build-
ings had regained power, with
the exception of East Hall,
which did not have electricity

until 7:30 p.m. last night.
Due to the lack of power,
all classes and exams sched-
uled in East Hall were can-
celled for the rest of the day.
Esrold Nurse, assistant dean
of undergraduate education,
sent an e-mail to select LSA
students announcing the
decision.

University students hoping to
reduce waste at football games and
in the dining halls are taking one
more step toward their goals.
About 40 students gathered in
the Samuel T. Dana Building last
night for an information session
about the Planet Blue Student
Initiative Fund, which is offering
between $5,000 and $50,000 to
students working on sustainability
projects on campus. In President
Mary Sue Coleman's announce-
ment about the initiative earlier
this semester, she guaranteed the
Fund a total of $150,000 over
three years.
LSA junior Abby Krumbein,
a member of the PBSIF Review
Board, said the initiative's goal is

In an effort to broaden the
University's educational offer-
ings on LGBT culture, students
are spearheading an initiative
to start a department devoted to
queer studies.
Students in the Michigan Stu-

dent Assembly's LGBT Issues
Commission want to create a
queer studies department in
LSA that would encompass
studies on the history, issues
and nature of queer culture.
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans-
gender and Sexuality Studies,
also referred to as queer studies,
is currently offered as a minor
in the Department of Women's
Studies.

Students succeed without foreign language tllter grades

Most classes in
the college use
traditional grading
By KATIE BURKE
For the Daily
For LSA students sweat-
ing over Spanish vocabulary,
the possibility of a grade-free

language course may seem
like a dream. But for students
studying an intensive foreign
language in the Residential
College, it's a reality.
All students in the RC must
meet the LSA requirement of
two years of a language and
then take a foreign language
proficiency exam followed by
a literature course. Since 2001,
all classes students in prepara-

tion for foreign language pro-
ficiency exams in the RC have
been pass/fail. Rather thangive
students grades, professors
provide students with detailed
evaluation sheets documenting
their performances.
Dominique Butler-Borruat,
head of the RC French Depart-
ment, said that in addition to
language classes, most classes
in the RC also followed the

same system until LSA man-
dated they use a normal grad-
ing scale starting in 2001.
Though post-proficiency class-
es switched to a traditional
grading system that year, pre-
proficiency classes remained
pass/fail.
"It's not about getting an A,"
Murphy said. "It's about get-
ting to where you can pass the
proficiency test."

Despite the changes, Mur-
phy said he thought the new
grading system was positively
received among the RC com-
munity.
"In the grand scheme of
things, students prefer having
grades for their classes," Mur-
phy said.
Because the goal of the pre-
proficiency classes is to pre-

From Russia, with science

Where are you from originally?
I'm from the country, which does
not exist anymore, which is USSR. I
was born in Moscow, Russia. I studied
in Moscow State University, which is
actually a pretty nice school.
What classes do you teach, and
what type of engineering are you
most passionate about?
Last semester was the chemical engi-
neering laboratory, where the students
learn how to apply the knowledge that
they gotin theoretical classes like ther-
modynamics or process engineering
to realistic situations. The other class,
which I really like and enjoy teaching,
is the class of nanotechnology, which
I will be teaching in the spring. I'm
trying to teach how easy it is to do the
nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is all

about engineering materials to achieve
particular properties that you want.
What do you want your students
to take from your classes?
It all comes down to the motivation
and excitement with your job. That's
what I would like my students to take
out of the class. You can be smart; it
doesn't matter. As long as you are moti-
vated and have basic knowledge and
persistence - I think you would enjoy
your job and your life.
What were you for Halloween?
I actually had Halloween a little
early. I spent it with a friend of mine,
and I came there as Harry Potter. I had
acape, glasses and a scarf. I think actu-
ally a lot of professors would like to be
Harry Potter.
What are your hobbies?

I think Zap Zone (laser tag) is one
of my biggest joys. This game repre-
sents competition, gives you skills and
relieves any kind of stress that you
have. If you're writing papers and sit-
ting in your office all the time, you
need to have some kind of amusement.
I think this game gives you the energy
for the rest of the week and allows you
to get in touch with your inner child.
Where do you see your career
heading in the next 10years?
Everybody has to have his or her
dreams. If I'm looking at the next 10
years, one of my dreams is to have some
of my inventions that were made in the
lab to make the transitions into say,
Wal-Mart. I'm willing to do my part in
order to make this happen.

Narcos, meet hackers: two

Hacking group
plans to expose
members of
Mexican cartel
MEXICO CITY (AP) - One
of the world's most secretive
movements is taking aim at a
just as clandestine mafia, right
out in the open.
Bloggers and tweeters claim-
ing to belong to the hacker
movement "Anonymous" say
they plan to expose collabora-
tors of Mexico's bloody Zetas
drug cartel, even if some of
them seem to have backed away
from the plan out of fear.
Their debate is playing out on
chatboards, websites and Twit-
ter messages, many of them

open to public view.
But just what they might do,
as a claimed deadline tomorrow
approaches, remains unclear,
perhaps even to the loosely
coordinated Internet commu-
nity. Its participants generally
hide their real-world identities
even from one another, partly
as protection from officials and
prosecutors who often consider
them outlaws.
Self-proclaimed members
of a movement best known for
hacking public corporate and
government websites are now
talking about attacking a drug
cartel that largely shuns the
Internet and has killed, even
beheaded, ordinary bloggers
for posting information about
it.
"The problem is, hack what?
There are no drug cartel web-


sites, that I know of, that would
be hackable," said Raul Trejo, an
expert on media and violence at
the National Autonomous Uni-
versity of Mexico.
In an Internet video posted
last month, a person wearing a
Guy Fawkes mask claimed the
Zetas had kidnapped a member
of Anonymous in the state of
Veracruz while he was hand-
ing out political pamphlets. The
video doesn't give the victim's
name, and prosecutors say they
know nothing about the sup-
posed abduction.
The speaker in the video
said that if the kidnap victim is
not released, Anonymous will
post the names, photos and
addresses of taxi drivers, police,
journalists and others alleg-
edly working with the Zetas. He
did not say how the movement
would get such information,
but suggested it can locate
and blow up cartel associates'
"cars, houses, bars and whore-
houses" starting Friday.
"It won't be difficult, we all
know who you are and where
you can be found," said the
masked speaker.
Members of Anonymous
are more of a volunteer crowd,
and generally don't even know
where their own colleagues
can be found. The participants
are known more for sabotag-
ing corporate and government
websites than for WikiLeaks-
style exposes.
Matt Harrigan, chief
executive of the San Diego,
California-based security
firm Critical Assets, said that
"absolutely it sounds like
their MO," but he noted it is a
change from past activities.
In the face of a death toll of
35,000 to 40,000 people killed
in drug violence in Mexico
since 2006, "maybe you're see-
ing Anonymous making some
sort of a sea change to more
positive actions rather than
focusing on the corporate
greed piece, or just 'hactivism'
against corporations," Harri-
gan said.

Iconic brand has
sold more than 200
million cars and
invented the S.U.V.
DETROIT (AP) - We saw the
USA in them. We drove them to
the levee. We even worked on our
night moves in their back seats.
For a century, Chevrolets won
America's love with their safety,
convenience, style and speed
- even if sometimes they were
clunky, or had problems with
rust or their rear suspensions.
Chevy, which lays claim to
being the top-selling auto brand
of all time, celebrated its 100th
birthday yesterday.
For most of its life, Chevy
stayed a fender ahead of the com-
petition by bringing innovations
like all-steel bodies, automatic
shifting, electric headlamps and
power steering to regular folks at
a low cost.
Chevy also embedded itself
in American culture, sometimes
changing it by knowing what
people wanted to drive before
they did. Snappy jingles and
slogans dominated radio and
television, and bands mentioned
Chevys in more than 700 songs.
No other automotive brand has
come close to the adoration that
Chevy won from customers,
especially in the 1950s and '60s.

"The American car from the
mid-1930s to the end of the '60s
was a Chevrolet," said John
Heitmann, an automotive his-
tory professor at the University
of Dayton and author of a book
about the automobile's impact on
American life. "It was the car of
the aspiring American lower and
middle classes for a long period."
On the way to selling more
than 204 million cars and trucks,
Chevy invented the sport utility
vehicle and an electric car with
a generator on board to keep it
going when the batteries die.
But it also helped ruin Gen-
eral Motors Co.'s reputation
for many. In the 1970s, it began
cranking out rust-prone, nonde-
script cars with gremlin-infested
motors and transmissions. Now
it's in the midst of a comeback,
selling better-quality vehicles as
a global.brand with 60 percent
of its sales coming outside the
United States.
Chevrolet Motor Co., was
launched on Nov 3, 1911, in
Detroit when Louis Chevrolet,
a Swiss-born race car driver
and engineer, joined ousted GM
founder William "Billy" Durant
to start a new brand.
Their first car was the styl-
ish and speedy Series C "Classic
Six." It had a powerful six-cylin-
der engine at a time when most
cars had only four. And it came
with an electric starter and
headlamps, which were a rar-

ity. But at $2,150 ($50,000 today,
when adjusted for inflation), it
was out of reach for most people.
Their next car, the "Little," was
smaller and less-expensive, with
a reliable four-cylinder engine. It
was far more successful.
But the founders clashed over
the future of the company. Chev-
rolet wanted to pursue his dream
of building high-performance
cars, while Durant was deter-
mined to cater to the masses. In
1915, Durant bought out Chevro-
let, who returned to auto racing.
A year after Chevrolet's
departure, the company sold
about 70,000 cars, giving Durant
enough cash to take control of
GM. He later made Chevy a sepa-
rate division of the company.
While Fords were made of
wood and canvas, Chevys were
steel, giving drivers more com-
fort and safety. Chevy had inde-
pendent suspensions for each
wheel that made cars ride and
handle better. And it mass-pro-
duced modern hydraulic brakes,
which stopped cars with less
effort and didn't pull to one side
like the mechanical brakes used
by Ford, according to Heitmann.
By 1927, Chevy overtook Ford
as the country's most popular
brand, selling more than 1 mil-
lion cars that year.
Through a combination of
innovation and affordability,
Chevy was the top U.S. brand for
52 of the next 83 years.

Coal ash spills into
Lake Michigan
A spokesman for a Wisconsin
utility confirms debris spilled into
Lake Michigan during a landslide
this week contained an unknown
amount of coal ash.
Coal ash is a byproduct of
burning coal. It contains low con-
centrations of arsenic, selenium,
lead and mercury but isn't classi-
fied as hazardous.
We Energies spokesman Brian
Manthey said yesterday it's too
early to know how much coal
ash ended up in the lake. He
says the majority stayed on land
and debris in the water has been
largely contained.
A scientist with a freshwater
institute in Milwaukee says any
environmental damage to Lake
Michigan probably will be limited
to the immediate area of the spill.
The spill happened Monday
when a section of cliff gave way
at the utility's coal-fired power
plant near Milwaukee.

More than 40
Atlanta schools to
lose federal status
Georgia has revoked the fed-

Atlanta elementary and middle
schools named in a massive cheat-
ing scandal.
The Georgia Department of
Educationreleased datayesterday
morning showing that a hand-
ful of the schools have lost their
status under the federal No Child
Left Behind Act dating back to
2001. The majority of the schools
had their standing yanked for
only 2009.
That means the schools can
face sanctions under federal law
andmayhaveto returnthousands
of dollars in federal money for
each year they reported inflated
test scores.
It's the first time the state has
released the federal standing for
Atlanta schools since July, when
state investigators revealed wide-
spread cheating in nearly half of
the district's 100 schools.

Senators offer
* plan to keep Postal
Service solvent
Senators announced a bipar-

the financially ailing Postal Ser-

mail delivery for at least two more
years.
The proposal would lift the
agency "from the brink of bank-
ruptcy," said Sen. Joe Lieberman,
chairman of the Senate Home-
land and Governmental Affairs
Committee.
The Postal Service lost $8 bil-
lion last year and could report
even larger losses when its 2011

budget year report comes out in
mid-November.
"We're not crying wolf here"
about the agency, said Sen. Susan

Pakistan says it has decided

The trove is hailed as a posi-
tive first step in normalizing

India.
The two nuclear-armed coun-
tries have fought three wars
since they were created in 1947.
Granting the most-favored

can now trade on equal terms,
typically giving each other low

TSA to expand

KHALID MOHAMMED/AP

withdraw from Iraq by the end of the year as required by a 2008 security agreement.

About 280,000
frequent fliers in
program
WASHINGTON (AP) - Test-
ing for a new program aimed at
getting certain travelers through
airport security with less hassle
has gone so well that the Obama
administration plans to expand it
to another round of airports and
travelers, the government said
yesterday.
The expanded testing will not
affect most travelers expected to
crowd the airports during this
year's busy Thanksgiving travel
season. But the government has
made other changes in the past
year that could make for a less
intrusive trip through airport
security.
Invasive pat-downs and full-
body imaging machines are still
a central part of the air traveler's
experience in the U.S.
But now children 12-and-under
are less likelyto be patted down or
forced to take off their shoes. And
about half of the full-body imag-
ing machines have been upgraded
to show an outline of a person
instead of a blurry naked image,
a feature of all new machines the
government purchases, Trans-
portation Security Administrator
John Pistole told Congress.
The pre-screening test pro-
gram and policy changes repre-
sent the Obama administration's
attempts at a more risk-based,
intelligence-driven passenger
screening program aimed at
responding to complaints that the
government is not using common

sense when it screens all travelers
the same way at airports.
Details of which airports and
airlines would be eligible for the
next round of testing for the pre-
screening program are still being
hammered out, Pistole said. Cur-
rently about 280,000 frequent
fliers from American and Delta
airlines - the two airlines eligi-
ble for the first round of testing -
are participating in the program,
accordingto TSA. The program is
being tested at airports in Atlan-
ta, Dallas, Detroit and Miami.
"This new screening system
holds great potential to strength-
en security while significantly
enhancing the travel experience,
whenever possible, for passen-
gers," Pistole said in a prepared
statement at a hearing before the
Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee.
But some enhanced security
measures put in place at U.S. air-
ports sincethe 2001 terrorattacks
continue to be controversial.
Some travelers and privacy
advocates object to the intimate
pat-down, a measure Pistole
called for to give screeners the
best chance at catching some-
one hiding a bomb in his under-
wear like the man authorities say
nearly brought down an airliner
over Detroit onChristmas Day in
2009.
Also, not everyone is comfort-
able going through a full-body
imaging machine that produces
a blurry image of their naked
bodies so that TSA screeners can
check for contraband. And there
are still complaints about having
to take off shoes to go through the
machines.

4,000 U.S. soldiers
to remain in Iraq
until year's end
WASHINGTON (AP) -
While all but a small number of
U.S. troops will be out of Iraq by
the end of the year, they won't
all be home for the holidays as
President Barack Obama prom-
ised last month.
The Pentagon is poised to
move at least 4,000 soldiers
from Iraq to Kuwait at the end
of the year, pending a final deci-
sion expected soon by Pentagon
and Kuwaiti leaders, U.S. offi-
cials said yesterday.
The move is part of a still-
developing Pentagon strategy
that ends the Iraq war but posi-
tions a strong U.S. force just
across the border in Kuwait and
across the region to reinforce
the United States' commitment
to the Middle East and prevent
a power vacuum when the tens
of thousands of U.S. forces who
have served in Iraq are gone.
According to officials, the 1st
Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division,
which is currently in Iraq, will
be shifted to Kuwait, where

troops will be close enough to
serve as a quick reaction force
if needed in Iraq or any of the
nearby countries. The officials
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because the decision has not
been finalized by Defense Sec-
retary Leon Panetta.
The plan to beef up U.S. pres-
ence in Kuwait also must be
approved by the Kuwaiti lead-
ers, although most officials do
not believe that will be a prob-
lem. The U.S. has had a sub-
stantial presence in Kuwait for
years, even before the start of
the Iraq war.
Other plans still under dis-
cussion would affect several
Army National Guard units that
are scheduled to go to Iraq in
the coming weeks. It is not yet
clear whether they will be told
to go to Iraq and return home in
two months or if they will sim-
ply stay. home or be deployed
elsewhere - such as Kuwait,
other nations in the region or
even other posts in the U.S.
Pentagon officials have been
clear all along that they expect
to continue and expand U.S.
military relations with coun-
tries in the Middle East, partic-
ularly as a hedge against Iran.

And Panetta has said that he
expect that about 40,000 U.S.
troops to be stationed across
the Middle East after troops are
pulled out of Iraq.
Over the next two months,
the U.S. will methodically with-
draw the remaining 34,000 or
so American forces from Iraq as
Obama pledged. The final exit
date was sealed after months of
intensive talks between Wash-
ington and Baghdad failed to
reach agreement on conditions
for leaving several thousand
U.S. troops in Iraq as a train-
ing force. The U.S. also had
been interested in keeping a
small force to help the Iraqis
deal with possible Iranian med-
dling.
So late last month, Obama
announced that the eight-year
Iraq war would be over by year's
end, and he declared that all
U.S. troops "will definitely be
home for the holidays."
That vow is now changed a
bit, as the 1st Cavalry Brigade,
which is based at Fort Hood,
Texas, will spend some months
in Kuwait, while U.S. leaders
grapple with how to redistrib-
ute troops around the region
for the long term.

Egypt pardons 334
sentenced in military
tribunals since Feb.

Nonpartisan group has Plan
B for picking 2012 candidate

Move part of
effort to maintain
communication
with youth in revolt
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's rul-
ing generals announced yester-
day the pardon of 334 Egyptian
civilians who were sentenced in
military tribunals since the upris-
ing that toppled President Hosni
Mubarak in February.
In a statement posted on its
Facebook page yesterday, the
Supreme Council of the Armed
Forces said the move was to sup-
port "the continued communi-
cation with the great Egyptian

people and the youth of the revo-
lution."
It did not say what those par-
doned were sentenced for or when
they would be released. It said the
names would be released later.
At least 12,000 people have
been tried by military courts since
January. Human rights groups
and Egyptian activists have
harshly criticized the practice.
The U.S. government has also
called on Egypt to try civilians in
civilian courts.
Late Wednesday, an Egyptian
border guard was wounded by
gunfire when a group of African
migrants assisted by Bedouin
smugglers attempted to infiltrate
across the border into Israel, the
state news agency MENA said.

American Elect
to offer alternate
candidates in all
50 states
WASHINGTON (AP) - Lots
of people complain about the
shortcomings of the country's
two-party system for picking a
president. Now a nonpartisan
group is gathering millions of
petition signatures - and dollars
- to offer people a Plan B.
Americans Elect, which grew
out of a failed 2008 effort to pro-
vide an alternative in the presi-
dential race, aims to secure a slot
on the November ballot in all 50
states for a to-be-determined
candidate who would be nomi-
nated in the nation's first online
convention next summer.
The group, whose backers
include both Republicans and
Democrats anxious to open up
the political process, has raised
$22 million so far and secured
ballot slots in Florida, Alaska,
Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and
Michigan. It has submitted sig-
natures for certification in Cali-
fornia, Utah and Hawaii.
Americans Elect, whose slo-
gan is "pick a president, not a
party," appears to be on track to
secure ballot access across the
country, with 1.9 million signa-
tures collected so far. But how it
will affect the 2012 race depends
on what kind of candidate its
delegates select in next June's
online convention, which will be
open to any registered voter.
"It's a fascinating experiment
in trying to empower the disen-
franchised center in American

politics," says Will Marshall,
one of the group's leaders and
the president of the Progressive
Policy Institute, a centrist Dem-
ocratic think tank. "It uses the
power of the Internet and social
media to provide a new means
for political participation."
Even Marshall admits,
though, that he approaches the
effort with some trepidation.
"I'd hate to see a scenario in
which a vibrant third choice in
some way threw the 2012 elec-
tion to a right-winger like a Rick
Perry or a Michele Bachmann,"
he says.
Americans Elect rejects the
notion its candidate could turn
out to be a spoiler and says that
putting the choice in the hands
- or clicks - of millions of reg-
istered voters will ensure the
selection of a qualified nomi-
nee. Leading candidates for
the group's nomination will be
required to choose a running
mate who is not from their own
party to ensure political balance,
it says.
Mark McKinnon, a GOP strat-
egist who advised George W.
Bush in his presidential cam-
paign, says he got involved in
the effort because "the system
is broken and the traditional
parties are only making a bad
situation worse." He sees the
Americans Elect effort as a rei-
magining of democracy and how
the country selects its leaders.
Getting on the ballot in all 50
states isn't all that unusual: The
New Alliance Party's Lenora
Fulani did in 1988. The Libertar-
ians have done it multiple times.
But none of them garnered a big
share of the vote.
Other outsider candidates

have been more successful: Ross
Perot got 19 percent of the vote in
1992 and 8 percent in 1996; John
Anderson, 7 percent in 1980: and
George Wallace, 13 'percent in
1968.

Stick to your guns
House must not pass bill weakening firearm laws
Anew law proposed by Republicans in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives threatens to significantly weaken regulations
on concealed weapons. The National Right-to-Carry Rec-
iprocity Act allows any person with a concealed carry permit to
carry a gun in any other state permitting concealed carry. The act
would take away individual states' rights to form their own gun
control laws and should not pass through the House.

Ryan and Josh revisited

Current gun laws give state and local gov-
ernments the power to set rules for gun per-
mits within their jurisdictions. The U.S.
Constitution gives citizens the right to bear
arms, but the specifics of if, how, where and
when concealed weapons are authorized for
use are decisions left up to individual states.
Many states restrict the sale of concealed
weapons to people over age 21, and some
refuse to give concealed carry permits to vio-
lent offenders.
Gun control is a controversial issue, so it's
appropriate that each state can make its own
decisions about gun regulationsowithin its bor-
ders. However, the National Right-to-Carry
Reciprocity Act would negate many of these
rules by forcing states with strict gun regu-
lations to recognize permits from states with
weaker gun laws. All states would be required
to allow visitors to carry concealed handguns
as long as the laws of the visitors' home state
permit them to do so.
The National Rifle Association is a primary
supporter ofthe billbecause it would eliminate
the complications associated with interstate
travel for individuals with concealed carry
permits: Supporters of the-bill-ontend that
current regulations can make travel across
state lines difficult for people who wish to

carry a concealed weapon. But these individu-
als fail to realize the danger that decreased
regulation on concealed carry permits could
cause and also fail to recognize that states
should have the right to decide which permits
from other'states they accept and which they
do not.
Many Republican legislators in the House
who advocate for limited government inter-
vention and maintenance of states' rights are
also pushing for the law. But the passage of
the law would unfairly subject the state resi-
dents to laws that their elected representa-
tives did not create. Arizona, Alaska, Vermont
and Wyoming do not even require a permit to
purchase a rifle, handgun or shotgun. These
lax state laws should not be forced onto other
states that do not agree with them and did not
vote on them.
In the wake of the tragic shooting of Rep.
Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) in Tuscon, earlier
this year, it is time to enact tighter regulations
on gun control instead of making concealed
weapons more accessible and easier to trans-
port across state lines. States should be per-
mitted to make their own decisions regarding
gun control and concealed carrying. This law
would completely infringe upon their right to
do so and should be promptly voted down.

S urprised by the different
types of feedback I received
from my last column (A Tale
of Two Students,
10/4/11), I have
decided to con-
tinue my study of
Ryan and Josh.
There are
three main fac-
tors that have
contributed to
who Ryan and ERIK
Josh are today TORENBERG
and where they
will go in the
future.
The first factor is their upbringing.
Though Josh grew up in a house-
hold that stressed the importance
of financial success, he believed
that this wasn't enough. There had
to be more to life than just money.
Whereas growing up his parents had
asked themselves: "How can I make
enough money to live the good life?"
Josh instead asked himself: "What is
the good life?" and then later, "ignor-
ing money, how can I change the
world?" (The great irony, of course, is
that the answer may require making
lots of money.)
Growing up, Josh was a people-
pleaser. He was often "adapting,"
which, in his case, meantbending his
interests and whims to what other
people expected from him. Every-
one liked Josh, but that wasn't the
problem. The problem was why they
liked him. People liked him because
they could easily influence him.
People liked him because they felt
constantly reaffirmed by him. People
didn't like him, however, when he
expressed ideas that went against the
grain, even if he felt he was becoming
more like himself.
Ryan has a different story. Though
his parents had modest incomes, the
rest of his family did not. He's seen
the stress that comes from living
paycheck to paycheck. At an early
age, he vowed to never let money be
a concern. Grades, as a result, were

always of paramount importance.
When adults were hard on him for
achieving anything less than perfect
marks, he was harder on himself. As
long as he can remember, perfection
has been habitual.
Yet his academic achievement
didn't translate to social success. His
lack of a certain indescribable qual-
ity prevented him from having any
social influence. Other people had
that quality and he couldn't figure
out what it was and why he didn't
have it. He didn't dwell over social
dynamics for too long, however,
because soon - for reasons he would
neither know nor question - he too
would have that social influence.
The second factorpertains totheir
natural talents and interests.
Josh is and always has been
strongly affected more by his own
thoughts and feelings rather than
with external things. Though he
loves to connect with people, to delve
deeply into why others do what they
do and why they think what they
think, he is at his best alone - where
he can contemplate and make mean-
ing through analyzing memories.
Whereas Josh is at his best one-
on-one, Ryan is at his best in large
group settings. Though he enjoys
meeting and mentoring individual
peers, he feeds off the energy creat-
ed by a collective, whether through
laughs at a party or brainstorming
sessions for a project.
The third factor deals with per-
ceptions of success.
If Josh had any doubts about bas-
ing life decisions on his conscience
and intuition, Steve Jobs's words -
"They somehow already know what
you truly want to become" - elimi-
nated any remnants.
Ryan read biographies of Abraham
Lincoln, Bill Gates and Warren Buf-
fet and craves a similar type of influ-
ence, of legacy.
So it's no wonder that Josh
strived to obtain the internal suc-
cess in college he couldn't find
growing up. Josh grabbed the

opportunity to redefine himself,
encouraging people to understand
him for who he was - or who he
aspired to be - rather than fitting
himself to how others wanted to see
him. He often over did this.
Our future is
determined by
self-perception.
And it's no wonder that Ryan
strived to obtainthe external success
in college he didn't have growing up.
Ryan grabbed the opportunity to
become a campus leader, influencing
and mentoring his peers instead of
shying away from displaying his tal-
ents and abilities. He, too, often over
did this.
Although there certainly is some
overlap between Ryan and Josh,
there are fundamental differences
in these three factors - upbringing,
natural talents and self-perceptions
- that have led each man to where he
is and will indicate where he will go.
Whereas Josh naturally bends
any assignment to himself, to how
he can personally benefit, Ryan nat-
urally bends himself to the assign-
ment, to how he can amaze the
grader. Whereas Josh is rigorous
in his quest for the right balance,
Ryan finds a balance in his rigor-
ous track. Whereas Josh thinks
life is a sculpture to be built from
scratch, uncertain of whether the
final product will stand strong but
confident in his approach, Ryan
thinks life is a sculpture to be built
from looking at other great models.
He has the blueprints of his ideal
life, and he is using the traditional,
provenmedium accordingly.

Sometime last year I made the crazy deci-
sion to write a political science honors the-
sis - quite possibly the most insane thing I
have ever done. And this year I'm definitely
paying for it. Not because I want to cry when-
ever I think about how much work I have to
do (though that's true too, come to think of it)
but because I can't find a place to write the
stupid thing.
My apartment is great but has all the dis-
tractions of a TV, friends and a comfy bed that
are guaranteed to be much more interesting
than writing about alternative explanations
to American non-ratification of multilateral
treaties. In order to avoid succumbing to the
siren call of a soft pillow and down comforter,
I have to relocate my writing time. The Hon-
ors Commons in Mason Hall is the perfect
place to write - a mixture of activity and
quiet where I can always find a table and an
outlet. Alas, IShave a tendency of working past
4:30p.m. when the Honors Commons closes
every day, and it's not open on weekends,
which leaves me and my computer wandering
campus searching for an outlet.
One day, in some strange parody of an old
Mr. Bean movie, I found myself stopping in at
every possible study location on campus. I'll
be the first to admit, I'm kind of picky when
it comes to a solid place to set up camp for the
day. I know I could go to the Law Quad and
live in the Law Library with all the stressed-
out Law students. It would be quiet, and there
are plenty of outlets on the tables. But frank-
ly, the Law Library is a littletfrightening - I
always feel like the student next to me looks

like he hasn't moved for three days and might
burst into tears at any moment. Plus, it's too
creepy quiet in there, and I get distracted
by its prettiness. Ditto with the Graduate
Library reading room. And I'm pretty sure
people get distracted by all the other people
hooking up in the stacks, so I try to avoid that.
While there are lots of outlets, I got lost in
there for a few hours and might be still suf-
fering PTSD from the experience.
I tried North Quad - might as well take
advantage of the multimillion dollar build-
ing - but I couldn't find an outlet there for
the life of me. So I found myself standing in
front of the UGLi with an unfortunate situ-
ation. Theoretically, it's my library, where
the undergrads go to get work done - or talk,
as the reality is - but since I had my iPod I
was ready to brave it. Really, it should be the
perfect mix of company and isolation. But
as I worked my way up the floors desper-
ately searching for an outlet I realized that
my library was failing me. It wasn't until
I reached the fourth floor that I even found
outlets on the table and getting an open seat
was like a fight to the death.
Needless to say it wasn't a very productive
day, and I'm still on the hunt for a good place
to write. A good table with an outlet so I can
actually use my computer shouldn't be all that
hard to find on this world-class campus, but
it is. In the meantime, I'm using it as a good
excuse to not work - don't tell my adviser
(just kidding, I swear I'm writing).

The United States legal sys-
tem serves as a testament to
cohesive and fair jurispru-
dence. Our legal codes are among
the most volu-
minous of any
society - from
ancient Greece to
modern day. The
same legal sys-
tem that acquits "
the innocent
and persecutes EAGHAN
criminals leaves DAVIS
a discretionary
gap for civil mat-
ters. I don't need to say that there is a
need for a large canon of civil infrac-
tions that can be brought to the court.
Yet, when citizens use the courts to
propagate their hateful sentiments in
last-ditch attempts to save face, judg-
es must recognize and dismiss these
cases immediately.
An Oct. 31 article in The Michigan
Daily revealed that former Michigan
assistant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell filed alawsuit inthe U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the Eastern District
of Michigan. Shirvell is suing attor-
ney Deborah Gordon for $75,000 in
damages relating to his termination
last November from the Attorney
General's office. Shirvell was fired
after it was shown that he lied dur-
ing a disciplinary hearing about his
actions relating to former Michigan
Student Assembly President Chris
Armstrong. Shirvell claims in his lat-
est press release that Gordon, Arm-
strong's lawyer, engaged in a "year
long campaign of intimidation and
defamation" against him.
Shirvell's public crusade against
Armstrong, the University's first
openly gay student body president,
began after the 2010 MSA election.

Shirvell started a blog, "Chris Arm-
strong Watch," - which no longer
exists - called for action against
Armstrong's "radical homosexual
agenda."
Some people may ask why I've
written extensively about Andrew
Shirvell throughout my time at The
Michigan Daily. The answer is that
I have been involved with the mys-
terious case of Shirvell from the
start. Last fall, the Daily broke the
news of Shirvell's harassment, and I
was a member of the editorial board
that was one of the first groups to
respond to the incident. I remember
sitting in the offices of the Daily and
browsing Shirvell's blog. The first
post contained a photo of Armstrong
with "Resign" written over his face
and a rainbow flag with a swastika in
the middle of it next to him.
Later posts were even more dis-
turbing. As The Michigan Daily
reported in September 2010, Shirvell
labeled Armstrong a liar, an elitist,
a racist, a pervert, and a "viciously
militant homosexual activist." Upon
gaining press attention for his Inter-
net attacks, Shirvell made trips to
Ann Arbor to sit in on MSA meetings
and protest on the Diag. In one case,
Shirvell stalked Chris Armstrong
at a Halloween party, which on his
blog Shirvell equated to a "gay sex
orgy." Since then, Shirvell has made
numerous statements to the Daily
defending his actions.
After Shirvell's review by the
Michigan Attorney General's office
and former Attorney General Mike
Cox, he was dismissed - for good
reason. Shirvell was using Michi-
gan tax dollars - writing many of
his posts from the Attorney Gen-
eral's office, while on the clock -
to conduct very public defamation

against a University student. The
very thought of this man, whose job
was to protect the civil liberties of
Shirvell's legal
license should be
in question.
citizens of the state of Michigan,
not degrade them, is repugnant.
Aside from being bizarre,
Shirvell's actions were deemed
unacceptable by his employer, Mike
Cox - a right-wing politician who
sought to prosecute adultery as a
first-degree case of criminal sexual
conduct. Cox later admitted to com-
mitting adultery against his wife in
2005. During his two terms as Mich-
igan Attorney General, Cox joined
19 other state Attorney Generals in
opposing President Barack Obama's
federal health care legislation.
In simple terms, Shirvell was
dismissed from an office and
administration that was wrought in
controversy and duplicity. I'm fairly
certain if any licensed psychologist
examined Shirvell's actions against
Armstrong, they'd concur that he is
suffering from delusions of gran-
deur. The judge assigned to hear
arguments on Shirvell's latest law-
suit must see it for what it is: A last-
ditch attempt to save face. Shirvell's
license to practice law should be
in question, not his absurd claims
about one of our peers.

OUTAGE

all classes scheduled in East
Hall have been cancelled for the
remainder of today (November
2, 2011)," Nurse wrote. "If you
have an exam today or this eve-
ning in East Hall, you will need
to contact either the instructor
or the department."
Due to East Hall's contin-
ued outage into the evening,
Economics Prof. Miles Kim-
ball moved the Economics 102
exams scheduled for last night
from East Hall to the Modern
Language Building and the
Dennison Building. In addi-
tion to notifying students of the
changed location via e-mail,
signs with redirections were
placed in East Hall. The exam's
start time was also delayed in

case students went to the incor-
rect location.
East Hall will be open for all
normal activities starting this
morning.
Other buildings reportedly
affected by the outage included
Angell Hall, Dennison Build-
ing, the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library, the Chemistry Building
and the Ross School of Business.
After the outage, there was a
subsequent surge at 12:23 p.m.
at one of DTE Energy's nearby
switching stations, accord-
ing to Brown. Many build-
ings experienced a "power
bump" following the incident
that caused them to temporar-
ily lose electricity. The second
outage, which extended to the
Medical Campus, caused the
buildings to temporarily lose
power again.
University spokeswoman

Kelly Cunningham said the
University used several forms
of social media including
e-mails, Twitter and Facebook,
along with website announce-
ments and digital displays at
the Hill Dining Center and
North Quad dining hall to alert
students of the outage.
Islamic history Prof. Michael
Bonner continued teaching his
class in Angell Hall despite the
outage. In an e-mail interview,
Bonner likened the experience
to a concert that pianist Vladi-
mir Horowitz gave at Carnegie
Hall in 1965 despite a power
outage in the auditorium that
forced him to play in the dark.
"I didn't want to waste time,"
Bonner wrote.

view that he, too, supports the stu-
dent movement and appreciates
students' desire to make changes
in academia.
"I am very pleased our students
have taken the initiative to inquire
about this ..." Monts wrote. "We
are always interested in teaching,
learning and research that sig-
nificantly expands knowledge and
engages our diverse community of
scholars."
In the past, student initiatives
led to the creation of the women's
studies and Afroamerican and
African Studies departments,
which became a department last

" pare students for the proficiency
exams, Murphy said the depart-
ment has a valid reason for not
basing evaluations on a tradi-
tional grading system.
"The priority of the RC lan-
guage classes is to have students
achieve proficiency in foreign
language, and the pass/fail grad-
ing is one way in which it works
to accomplish that goal," Murphy
said. "We've found ways to make
it work. It's the system we have,
and it's not going to change."
The evaluations are detailed
and vary based on the level of
difficulty of the class, according
to Murphy. Some are one page

assault prevention video, preven-
tion services, outreach to stu-
dents living on North Campus
and a response team to help sur-
vivors.
SAPAC was also recognized
by the department as being one
of the best programs of its kind.
Rider-Milkovich said she's proud
of the recognition and pointed to
the University's environment as
the key to SAPAC's success.
"We are the best in the work
that we do and that is very much
because of the institutional help
that we receive, and it's also
because of the ways in which our
students push us to always do bet-
ter," she said.
Last month, SAPAC celebrated
its anniversary with a concert
featuring musical performances
by Ella Riot, Hana Malhas, and
Izzrael.
LSA junior Ellie Howe, co-
coordinator of networking, pub-

licity and advertising for SAPAC,
said what she loves most about
being involved in the center is the
sense of community it creates and
the staff's commitment.
"I love how dedicated SAPAC
is to its mission," Howe said. "Our
professional staff members don't
work 9 to 5. They work much lon-
ger hours because they really care
about the work that they do."
Howe added that it's important
students recognize that SAPAC is
a source of pride for the Univer-
sity.
"I want everyone to know how
exciting it is that we live on a cam-
pus that has such a multi-dimen-
sional and prioritized resource
center like this in our university,
and our group provides some of
the best services in the country,"
Howe said. "Sometimes I don't
think we realize how lucky we are
to have a place for survivors and
allies to go to."

PROJECTS

going green at the University.
"We're looking for proposals
that are visible and will create
more of a presence of sustain-
ability on campus," Krumbein
said.
Krumbein added that the ini-
tiative creates opportunities for
students to get more involved in
sustainability projects on cam-
pus, allows students to expand
their leadership experience and
fosters partnerships with the
University administration.
The board will review proj-
ects once they are submitted to
determine which projects will
receive funding and the amount
they're granted. All University
students are invited to submit a
project proposal.
Sustainability has become a
major focus for the University
administration, which is dedi-
cating $14 million toward a num-
ber of sustainability projects by
2025. Coleman pledged to intro-

duce measures including hybrid
buses, solar panel fields on North
Campus and an LSA minor in
sustainability.
Rackham and Business stu-
dent Phel Meyer, a member
of the PBSIF board, said he is
happy University officials are
emphasizing sustainability.
"We're all really happy with
the fact that it's gotten the atten-
tion of the administration,"
Meyer said.
He added that it will still take
some time before the University
reaches its potential in the area
of sustainability. Meyer said one
of the areas that needs improve-
ment is decreasing waste at foot-
ball games, which is the topic
of his project proposal. Meyer
wants to work with the Athletic
Department to instate the use
of compostable and recyclable
packaging and wrappers used
at concessions to cut down on
waste at football games.
The Ohio State University
implemented a similar project
at their football games, accord-
ing to Meyer. Based on the OSU

program numbers, he expects
a similar project at the Univer-
sity to cost between $100,000 to
$200,000 a year.
Meyer said he thinks his proj-
ect could succeed in gaining
funds from the PBSIF, but he is
a little nervous about the amount
of competition.
"I was (optimistic) until I
showed up here and saw how
many people were at (the event),"
Meyer said.
LSA sophomore Shaina Kwi-
atkowski attended the session
and said she would like to make
students more aware of how
much they waste in the dining
halls. Her proposal includes a
food waste audit to detail how
much food is wasted per person.
"I actually went to Michigan
State last year, and they had a
food waste audit, and it really
opened my eyes to how much
food has been wasted, and so I
think it will raise awareness for
the students," Kwiatkowski said.

year.
The Michigan Student Assem-
bly will first discuss the possibil-
ity of creating the queer studies
deparment, Monts wrote. Then,
the University will conduct acom-
prehensive review of the research,
literature and teaching in the sub-
ject.
"I look forward to hearing the
thoughts of those who are con-
ductingthese firstimportantsteps
in the process," Monts wrote.
LSA junior Ethan Hahn, co-
chair of the LGBT Issues Com-
mission, said he thinks the current
queer studies minor that is offered
does not supply enough informa-
tion on the subject because it only
teaches the history of LGBT cul-
ture. In the queer studies depart-
ment, he said queer theory and the
future of LGBT culture would be
taught along with history.
Hahn added that he envi-
sions the concentration offered
by the department to be broad
and applicable to many different
professional fields such as law or
medicine.
"(The major) is a way for stu-
dents to have an opportunity to
learn more about queer culture

and how to handle today's issues,"
Hahn said.
Creating the department would
also be a way to provide more job
opportunities for professors at the
University, Hahn said.
The potential new department
would be affiliated with other cul-
tural departments and concentra-
tions, according to Architecture
and Urban Planning junior Kris-
ten Mayer, the other co-chair of
the LGBT Issues Commission.
"Hopefully, there are still some
ties between the queer studies and
women's studies departments,"
Mayer said.
While the main focus of the
commission this year is to spread
awareness of the initiative and
gain student and faculty support,
members of the commission pre-
dict queer studies will become a
potential department in the next
few years.
"So far, everyone has been sup-
portive," Mayer said. "We haven't
run into any opposition yet."
The LGBT Issues Commission
is holding a mass meeting today
in the MSA Chambers to provide
more information on the initiative
and garner support from students.

Canada company: Pipeline
delays could cost $1M a day

Controversial
pipeline would
span from
Canada to Texas
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - A
Canadian pipeline developer that
wants to run an oil line through
six states to Texas refineries
would lose at least $1 million a
day and suffer "substantial eco-
nomic harm" if opponents delay
or derail the project, a top execu-
tive said in response to a federal
lawsuit.
Robert Jones, a TransCanada
vice president who is overseeing
the hotly contested Keystone XL
pipeline project, said in a sworn
statement that delays would sad-
dle the company with unavoid-
able expenses - such as for
pre-ordered construction equip-
ment - and damage its relation-
ship with shippers.
"Successful efforts to delay or
derail the permitting process will
not only affect TransCanada's
investment in the Keystone XL,
but also result in diminishing
the value of the entire Keystone
pipeline system," Jones said in
an Oct. 7 sworn statement filed in
U.S. District Court of Nebraska.

"TransCanada has a significant
interest in being able to satisfy
existing contractual obligations
to its shippers on the Keystone
XL pipeline."
State Department officials,
who have jurisdiction over the
pipeline because it crosses an
international border, have said
they hope to approve or deny a
permit for the project by the end
of the year.
TransCanada and pipeline
supporters have maintained that
the project would create U.S.
construction jobs, help lower gas
prices and reduce dependence
on Middle East oil. Jones' state-
ments are a reminder of the com-
pany's own stake in the fight over
the pipeline that has embroiled
interests from Washington to
affected states like Nebraska,
where the project has met some
of its strongest resistance.
A coalition of environmental-
ists, lawmakers and landowners
are fighting the proposal amid
fears that the Keystone XL could
leak and pollute the Ogallala
aquifer, a groundwater supply
that sprawls beneath Nebraska
and seven other states. Environ-
mental groups have argued the
project could also threaten wild-
life and say there's no guarantee
the oil willgo to U.S. customers.

The Nebraska Legislature
opened a special session this
week to consider changing the
law to give the state more control
over the Keystone XL and other
major oil lines. TransCanada has
promised to file court challenges
if Nebraska tries to intervene,
saying the decision is a federal
issue.
Jones estimated the losses a
delay would cause in a statement
filed as a response to a federal
lawsuit filed by three environ-
mental groups. TransCanada was
not named in the lawsuit, which
targetsthe U.S. State Department
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife for not
stopping early groundwork on
the project. The company filed a
motion to intervene because of its
financial stake in the case.
TransCanada said it already
has spent $1.7 billion on the
$7 billion Keystone XL, which
would carry crude oil fromAlber-
ta to Texas Gulf Coast refineries,
according to Jones' statement.
Jones said the $1 million-per-
day loss estimate was based on
TransCanada's existing prom-
ises to buy construction materi-
als that require a great deal of
advance notice, its commitments
to power utilities, and the costs
of maintaining staff and equip-
ment, among other expenses.


in length while others can be
as long as six pages. Along with
evaluations, other methods are
in place to supplement students'
language proficiency like lunch-
time conversation groups.
RC freshman Adam Molnar is
a student in Spanish 294 - the
final class students take before
the Spanish proficiency exam.
He said his class holds manda-
tory hour-long lunch or coffee
meetings to practice speaking
skills, and his group meets
three times a week to hold con-
versations entirely in Spanish.
Molnar said he thinks the pass/
fail system as a means of mak-
ing a work-intensive class less
stressful.
"(The system is) super nec-
essary because (the class) is

really difficult ..." Molnar said.
"You feel like you're failing at all
times, so you pass the test."
However, other students think
the pass/fail system is unneces-
sary. RC freshman Bailey Binke,
who's taking French, said she
would prefer letter grades over
the written evaluations.
"Having a huge amount of
credit to be pass/fail ... I'd rather
it just to be a letter grade," Binke
said.

The offensive line proved its
worth by demolishing Purdue at
the point of attack, leading red-
shirt sophomore running back
Fitz Toussaint to a career day
and giving junior quarterback
Denard Robinson plenty of time
to throw.
"That's really what we've

said. "The offensive line moved

Borges placed the game in the Toussaint ran for 170 and two

touchdowns. Senior running
back Mike Shaw had a 37-yard
touchdown scamper.
And all this success came
while Robinson enjoyed his new
less-intensive role in the shadow
of the offense - Borges could
pick his spots to run the quarter-
back.
With Toussaint, when Borges
called the power play to the left,
Molk and Schoefield, who was
playing left guard, would pull
and get out in front to block for
the running back.
Meanwhile, the two lineman
on the other side of the play
sealed off the backside in case
Toussaint needed to cut back

toward the middle of the field.
No matter the combination, no
matter who was running the ball,
Michigan's offensive line created
enough space that the ball carri-
er usually had a sizable chunk of
yards before he had to deal with
any would-be tacklers.
But in order to effectively exe-
cute a blocking scheme where
multiple linemen are pulling, or
any of Michigan's man or zone
schemes for that matter, commu-
nication is "critical," Borges said.
Molk, Lewan, Omameh and
fifth-year senior right tackle
Mark Hugye started on the line
last season, and Borges noted
their communication was great

already.
Yet the questions remain: Who
knows how Mealer or Khoury
would react to facing a physi-
cal Iowa front four, running an
offense that suddenly seems ded-
icated to the power run game?
And how could one weak link
affect the other four lineman?
Already, Borges conceded that
the lack of depth has affected
what they can do offensively.
"Yes, we're not very deep,"
Borges said. "But we have some
good players, and we have to play
with what we have, and I like
them.
"There may not be a lot of
them, butI like them."

Wolverines look
to finish strong

Michigan coach John Beilein has been going up against legendary coaches Mike Krzyzewski (Duke) and Billy Donovan (Florida) in recruiting Mitch McGary.
McGary sweepstakes ending

Nation's No. 2
recruit to pick
between Michigan,
Duke and Florida
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan basketball sea-
son starts on Friday with an
exhibition against Wayne State,
but the program's most impor-
tant day of the week is Thurs-
day, That's when the nation's No.
2 recruit, Mitch McGary, will
decide between Michigan, Duke
and Florida.
It has been widely reported
that McGary's decision has
come down to a battle between
the Wolverines and Blue Devils,
with reports from ESPN.com and
Scout.com indicating that Michi-
gan is the front-runner.
McGary is ranked No. 2 by
both ESPN.com and Scout.com.
Though Rivals.com ranks him
as its No. 3 player, all three sites
agree that the 6-foot-S10 McGary
is the nation's top big man.
McGary would undoubtedly be
Michigan's most important bas-
ketball signee since top-ranked
Chris Webber in 1991, and the
biggest name to arrive on campus
since running back Sam McGuff-
ie joined the football program
in 2008. The Wolverines aren't
used to out-recruiting Duke or
Florida, who've combined to
win three of the last six national
championships. But McGary's

AAU coach and mentor Wayne
Brumm says that hasn't hurt
Michigan's chances.
"I don't see where that would
be a detriment," Brumm told The
Michigan Daily on Monday. "In
other words, if the person wants
to go through the recruiting pro-
cess as a fan, that's one thing: So
everybody loves the Yankees,
everybody used to love the Dal-
las Cowboys and everybody loves
the big names in college basket-
ball, so if you want to be a fan,
that's one thing.
"If you're informed and you
really do your research, you do
digging and you get to under-
stand the interworkings and
what's important, I don't think
that would keep Michigan from
competing against those kind
of teams or those kind of pro-
grams."
Brumm specifically had high
praise for Michigan coach John
Beilein and his staff.
"I think the strength' of the
staff would be a plus," Brumm
said. "They seem to have a very
good chemistry amongst the
staff, not only the team, but even
the staff. They seem to be highly
qualified, and of course Beilein
has tremendous integrity and
character, so to have a player
tutored by somebody like that, I
think it makes sense."
McGary currently attends
Brewster Academy, a prep school
in New Hampshire that sent
seven players to Division-I pro-
grams last year. He hails from
Chesterton, Ind., home of Michi-

gan senior guard Zack Novak.
McGary played primarily on
Chesterton's JV squad during
Novak's senior season but prac-
ticed alongside Novak and the
varsity team. According to Ches-
terton head coach Tom Peller, the
two are friendly, which is why
Novak was the logical choice to
host McGary on his official visit
to Michigan earlier this fall.
"When (McGary) came by in
the summer - and Zack always
comes by in the summer - they
got to be talking to each other
and there's a relationship there,"
Peller said. "They were on the
same team in a couple of pick-up
games and open gyms (through-
out the summer)."
McGary's connection to the
Wolverines doesn't end there. He
is the AAU teammate of incom-
ing freshman forward Glen Rob-
inson III - ranked No. 38 in the
country by Scout.com - who has
already committed to Michigan.
Unlike in football, where
recruits are restricted from sign-
ing binding letters of intent until
February, basketball recruits
have an early signing period
beginning on Nov. 9, which is
when McGary has indicated he
will sign.
"I think he's enjoyed his sta-
tus of being recognized as one of
the top basketball players in the
country," Brumm said. "I think
he's burned out a little bit of the
recruiting process because it
just gets old after a little while.
Everybody's saying, 'We love
you. We want you. We want you

to come here, you'll be a differ-
ence-maker.' You can only hear
that so many times. So he's bored
with the recruiting process."
At 250 pounds, McGary has
the size and tools to make his
presence felt immediately. His
offensive game is played pri-
marily with his face to the bas-
ket, which fits in perfectly with
Beilein's high-post offense.
McGary has an excellent mid-
range game and the ability to
knock down3-pointers. Givenhis
size and position, he is a remark-
ably talented ball-handler.
With his exceptional strength,
McGary already has the body to
outmuscle Big Ten post players
for rebounds and position.
"If he were to end up in the
Big Ten, he would be a huge suc-
cess, just a huge success," said
Brumm, who coached Purdue's
Robbie Hummel and E'Twaun
Moore. "I've seen him do things
with the ball that I've had point
guards not be able to do. He runs
- he outruns guards. I've seen.
him shoot the ball as well as any-
body.
"There's not another 6-(foot)-
10 kid that can handle him out
there, because he's going to blow
right by you, he's going to go
through you, he's going to shoot
it over you, but he can also post
you up and score inside. That's
what makes him unique. That's
what makes him special. That's
why he's No. 2 in the country."
McGary will make his deci-
sion public at 5 p.m. Thursday on
ESPNU's Recruiting Nation.

The Michigan men's soccer
team hasn't given up hope just
yet.
Looking at the Wolverines'
record (1-4 Big Ten, 5-12 overall),
it's apparent they haven't had the
season they had expected. But
what the record doesn't show is
how close those losses have been.
Ten of those games were one-
goal losses, and six games went
into overtime.
"Our record is not reflective
of how good we actually are,"
said senior captain Adam Shaw.
"Those one-score losses are a
sign that we can compete with
any team."
The Wolverines have strug-
gled since winning last year's Big
Ten Championship and qualify-
ing for the NCAA College Cup in
Santa Barbara, Calif.
Four players from last season
traded in their maize and blue
jerseys to go professional after
last season, taking away over 95
percent of the team's goal scor-
ing.
With the lack of scoring this
season, Michigan has looked to
strengthen its counterattacking.
This tactic proved effective two
weeks ago in a 1-0 overtime vic-
tory against then-No. 4 Akron.
Junior midfielder Latif Alashe's
game-winning goal in that game
was one of just seven tallies that
the Zips had allowed all season
to that point.
"Anytime you play a team that
you think is better, you play more
conservatively," said Michigan
coach Steve Burns. "We made it
difficult for Akron because we
would counterattack."
Added Shaw: "We had to
change the way we were possess-
ing the ball. Counterattacks were
necessary to beat them."
Even after the thrilling win
against Akron, Michigan's diffi-
culties continued when it lost by
one goal to San Diego and Michi-
gan State.
With one game left in the reg-
ular season, the Wolverines will
look to prove themselves against

Northwestern at home on Satur-
day.
"When I think about beat-
ing teams, I think about playing
to the best of your ability both
physically and mentally," Shaw
said. "Tactics do play a part, but
attitude is more important."
Putting the last two games
behind them, the Wolverines
look to use the confidence from
the Akron game to help the Wol-
verines put an end to Northwest-
ern's eight-game winning streak.
Northwestern is the only unde-
feated team left in the Big Ten.
Burns described the Wildcats'
play as "statistical soccer" and
said he would not be surprised if
it was another 1-0 game.
"Tactics do
play a part, but
attitude is more
important."
"Northwestern is very good
at counterattacking," Burns
said. "Fans who come and watch
can expect it to be a very tacti-
cal game, and our counterat-
tacks will need to be our main
strength."
The Wolverines, who are
locked in at the sixth position in
the conference, will also look to
use this game as preparation for
the Big Ten Tournament, which
will be held Nov. 9-13 in Ann
Arbor. Despite the disappointing
season so far, Michigan still has a
chance to reclaim last year's title.
"In the Big Ten, there are no
easy games, and it is really wide
open right now," said Burns.
"I wouldn't be surprised if No.
7-seeded Penn State ends up
playing in the final."
.Added Shaw' "We are going
to play the rest of the season
with an attitude of no tomorrow.
Everything is on the line now,
and we are prepared to put our
game plan in."


Vaughan rehabbing with Michigan at Yost

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
The last few practices at Yost
Ice Arena would have looked a
little odd to Michigan hockey
fans familiar with the 2010-11
team.
Seniors Shawn Hunwick and
Greg Pateryn have been work-
ing alongside the familiar face of
Scooter Vaughan, fine tuning the
game plan for Western Michi-
gan.
But 2010, this is not.
When Vaughan finishes up a
drill, freshman forward Phil Di
Giuseppe skates over and replac-
es him.
Vaughan, who graduated
last semester, has been practic-
ing with No. 3 Michigan (2-1-1
CCHA, 6-1-1 overall) for the last
three weeks. He has been rehab-
bing a broken arm sustained in
the San Jose Sharks' training
camp, trying to stay fresh to play
professionally this season.
Vaughan was cut from the
Sharks after the injury, but will
be playing in the East Coast
Hockey League (ECHL) for the
Wheeling (W.V.) Nailers.
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son was happy to have him back,
as he is with most of his former
Wolverines.
It says something about a pro-
gram when a former player is
welcomed back into Yost - when
players talk about the "Michigan
family," they really aren't kid-
ding.
"They know that we are proud
of them and we care about them
after they leave," Berenson said.

fl-H,,

Former Michigan forward Scooter Vaughan leaves Ann Arbor on Monday to join the Wheeling Nailers in West Virginia.

"We can't do everything for
them, but at least we can help
them with the next step."
Even though Vaughan isn't
exactly a grizzled old man at 22
- Hunwick is 24 - he has sig-
nificantly more experience than
much of the roster, namely the
eight freshmen.
Vaughan imparted some wis-
dom on the younger players, as
much as someone who graduated
six months ago is able to. But he
has also seen why the team has
had success early this season.
"They are a good bunch of
guys," Vaughan said. "They seem
to really like each other and
spend a lot of time together away
from the rink."

Vaughan's presence around
practice, though, begs the ques-
tion of comfort. Is it weird to be
at your old digs, with so many
new faces?
"It's very weird - it's not my
team anymore," Vaughan said.
"I would love nothing more than
to have another year under my
belt and be able to play in Yost
with all the guys but my time is
done. I had my four years and it
was fun while I was here but it's
time to move on. It's nice to be
back. They treat their ex-players
well."
With Michigan suffering sev-
eral injuries, Vaughan has filled
a void on one of Michigan's five
lines in practice, so the last few

weeks have helpedboth Vaughan
and Michigan.
Vaughan will be leaving for
the ECHL on Monday, looking
to extend his career in West Vir-
ginia. His last few weeks in Ann
Arbor could only have helped.
"I think it's been good for him,
kept him fresh and kept him
skating," Berenson said. "The
players at the next level don't
skate any better than our play-
ers. He just needs a chance to get
in the game.
"I think he could play a game
in the NHL and not be out of
place. But it doesn't matter what
I think, it's what someone else
thinks and what someone else
needs."

The rise of a 'U' theatr
troupe from the Basement
to the national stage
By Kavi Shekhar Pandey, Senior Arts Editor

bouttwoyears ago, inabasementon aNorth
Campus far, far away, a group of friends
from the University's theater program put
on "A Very Potter Musical," a lovingly witty
tribute to The Boy Who Lived and his wiz-
arding pals. Inadvertently, the musical's international
fame blossomed, and its creators, members of the group
now called StarKid, followed up with the legendary Base-
ment Arts performances "Me and My Dick" and "A Very
Potter Sequel."
The founding members of StarKid, who are all alumni
of the University's School of Music, Theatre & Dance,
have moved base camp to Chicago, where they continue
to put on original musicals like last February's "Starship."
But tomorrow night, the crew will return home to the
Michigan Theater for the opening leg of their S.P.A.C.E.
(StarKid Precarious Auditory Concert Experience) tour.
Everyone knows the fame: Darren Criss in "Glee" and
his impending succession of Daniel Radcliffe's role on
Broadway. Everybody knows the numbers: The group's
channel has more than 100 million views on YouTube. But
the story behind their rise to global stardom reveals how
truly remarkable and down to earth these StarKids are.
A StarKid is born
The beginning of StarKid can be traced back to a Base-
ment Arts stage adaptation of one of the great fantasytales
of our time - no, not "Harry Potter" (that came later), but
"The Hobbit." Back in 2006, then MT&D student Nick
Lang pitched the idea to put on a "Hobbit" play to Base-
ment Arts. The student group approved it, but that was
before Lang had actually read the play. Once the script was
in his hands, Lang realized it wasn't good and decided to
rewrite it - which is against the rules of Basement Arts.
"But that's a big part of StarKid," said 2009 alum Joe
Walker. "Doing whatever the hell we need to make the
show good."
"The Hobbit" begat April 2008's production of "The
Hobbit 2: The Lord of the Rings" which featured much of

the current StarKid cast, including 2009
alum Lauren Lopez as Frodo Baggins, 2008
alum Brian Holden as Aragorn and Walker
as Boromir, Faramir and their father Denethor
(who Walker calls the "asshole humans"). While
Lang's version of "The Hobbit" toed the line between
proper story and parody,this production was more explic-
itin its absurdity - Sauronwas defeated by tying his shoes
together (delayed spoiler alert), for one.
Alas, there's no opportunity for StarKid fans to see a
video of the "Lord of the Rings" adaptation, but the show
succeeded in developing a working relationship among the
StarKids-to-be and making an impression on those who
weren't directly involved with the play.

"I'm a year behind, so my freshman year I saw the show
and thought, 'Holy shit, that's the funniest thing I've ever
seen,' said 2011 alum Joey Richter, who would go on to
play Ron Weasley in the "Potter" musicals.
At this point, there was no conception that the actors
were in some sort of troupe - they just took classes and
were friends with each other in the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance. Walker and Richter described the theater
program as a "small fraternity" where everyone, if not
friends, at least knew each other.

SAMOSAS , 0

RAJA RANI
400 South Division Street
A samosa is a great way to start a tasty
Indian meal, and Raja Rani's version
turns out to be done just about right. The
crispy pastry on the outside and potato
and peas in the filling come together
beautifully in a rich blend of textures and
spices. Pair these samosas with a cup of
steaming chai for an especially delicious
appetizer or snack.
MADRAS MASALA
328 Maynard Street
Samosas are India's favorite appetizer
because of their deliciously crunchy exte-
rior and spicy, tear-inducing interior. But
at Madras Masala, that highly anticipated
first bite into a samosa isn't nearly as magi-
cal. The tips aren't crunchy enough and
the filling tastes like bland potato mash.
Ultimately, the only thing tear-inducing
about this dish is its $3.95 price.

SHALIMAR
307 South Main Street
The Shalimar samosa is like no other
stuffed pastry in Ann Arbor. It owes to the
lightness and flavor to Shalimar's Maida
flour and the northern Indian curry spicing
the generous cuts of fresh potato, onion and
peas. Though dense in stuffing, it has a thin
and flakey crust that manages to be both
rich in coriander and cumin and low in oil.
No one does a northern samosa better.

fun, and the filling is melt-in-your-mouth
smooth. But still, it's hard to shake the
feeling that these samosas should have
some fire to their taste ... simply put, the
spark's not there.

LSA senior
at a MichKnit meeting
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
I'm definitely a good witch.
Which of the "Harry Potter" movies is your favorite?
The first movie is my absolute favorite because it's true to the book,
and everybody is adorable.
What's your favorite museum?
I'm from New York, so I like the Met. I found a portrait that looked
exactly like my sister.
Have you ever eaten a samosa?
Are those the Girl Scout cookies?

The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom Thursday, November 3, 2011 - 3B

The finest
and the best

B ehold, the newest
forum for college gos-
sip: collegesfinest.com.
Created by three students
from Michigan State Univer-
sity, this
website
allows
students to
compare
images of
guys and
girls to find
the "fin- HALEY
est" at their GOLDBERG
university.
It's a simple
concept: Users click on their
college of choice (currently
limited to Michigan State and
the University of Michigan)
to compare students. They
then select "Compare Guys"
or "Compare Girls," and two
images of students appear,
giving the option to choose
the "finest"
This new forum of gossip
came to me in a Belgian waffle
haze, as I sat down in the Hill
Dining Center ready to dig
into the Michigan-branded
delight I just made. A guy
pushed a neon-colored flyer
into my face with the words
"Colleges' Finest" flashing
at the top. After he left, my
roommate and I began bash-
ing the website, saying it
was shallow and immature.
But when we went up to our
room and I logged onto the
site, something amazing hap-
pened: I couldn't stop rating
the guys and girls at our Uni-
versity!
My comments of "This is so
stupid" and "Why would any-
one post their picture on this
website?" quickly turned into
"guy on the left" and "guy on
the right" as I was sucked into
the concept of Colleges' Fin-
est. I didn't want to compare
my peers, but this website just
made it so darn easy!
Of course, since the site
is new, it has its downsides.
There are so few pictures of
men and women that almost
every time, I was shown
either the picture of a man
holding a swaddled baby or
a bro on a Jet Ski. Also, the
forum the website has set
up for people to post about
the finest bars and cafeterias
on campus is majorly lack-
ing. Nonetheless, I was still
addicted to rating my peers.
But the reality of the web-
site suddenly set in when an
image of a girl flashed upon
my screen: a friend from one
of my classes. Although the
website fully told me I was
judging my peers, it initially
seemed so distant from me,
mostly since I didn't recog-
nize the man holding the baby
or the Jet Ski bro. But now,
judging the appearance of
someone I knew? That was
too much.
4 I could have selected her
as the finer choice, possibly
putting her in the running
for finest girl of the week/
month, but I couldn't do it
- I couldn't judge someone
I knew in that way. And as
I exited the website, I won-
dered: If in reality I don't
judge people, then why is it
so easy for me to do so in an

online forum?

My mind flashed back
to the scene in "The Social
Network," when a drunken
Mark Zuckerberg creates
Facemash, and people across
the Harvard campus indulge
in comparing their peers by
rating who is better looking.
The commonalities between
Zuckerberg's Facemash and
Colleges' Finest are endless.
It's easy to click right and
left, deciding who is better-
looking out of an endless sea
of unknown peers. I maybe
alone, but realizing I'm judg-
ing people I know just makes
the whole process a lot more
shameful. And for me, the
fact that the name, school
and Greek life affiliation of
these people appears after a
user selects their image just
makes the website that much
more offensive. These are real
people, and I don't want to
play a part in judging them on
that basis.
It's no fun to
judge people
you know.
On its website, Colleges'
Finest advertises itself as a
place where users can "view
data about college life, for
example, the best looking stu-
dent bodies around America"
- but what's the purpose of
selecting the best looking
person at our school? I'm not
denying that seeing our school
rated finest over Michigan
State wouldn't instigate a
sense of pride, but in reality,
does it really matter?
Furthermore, in order to be
ranked the finest, University
students have to go on the
website and compare images
of ourselves to Michigan State
students. Without knowing
which schools the two images
are from, we must select our
students as more attractive
in order to move up the rank-
ings. While we may deem our-
selves as the most physically
appealing, the notion of our
peers judging others so mate-
rialistically is more of an ugly
characteristic than an attrac-
tive trait of our University
student body.
Again, I admit to succumb-
ing to the intoxicating design
of the website and the ease
with which a user can rate
a person with the click of a
button. But it's blatantly obvi-
ous this gossip website serves
no true purpose, other than
making the idea of passing
judgments seem acceptable.
The Jet Ski bro, the man hold-
ing the swaddled baby and all
the students on collegesfinest.
com are real people. And even
though they subject them-
selves to judgment by posting
their pictures on the website,
I believe our peers and our
establishment deserve more
than a rating on looks toube
deemed the "finest" and the
best.

without stopping - was a suc-
cess. The Basement Arts audi-
ences were treated to the magic
of Voldemort dancing a jig, Ron's
endless caloric intake and Draco
Malfoy (played by Lopez) slither-
ing around on stage, and the cast
and crew went home happy.
"We didn't even expect people
to show up to the show," Richter
said. "It was just for fun, and even
after the show it was an, 'OK, that
was fun. It's over. What a good
time we had."'
The video that launched
a million hits
The decision to put the "Harry
Potter" musical on YouTube was
motivated by geographic and eco-
nomic necessity. The mostly grad-
uated cast had gone off to start
careers in New York City and Los
Angeles and wanted to be able to
share the show with friends and
family, so the cheapness and con-
venience of YouTube was prefer-
able to creating and distributing
DVDs.
Their stardom ignited when
links to the videos were sent to
friends at "Harry Potter" news
sites, including MuggleNet and
The Leaky Cauldron. With the
huge traffic and influence of these
websites in the Harry Potter fan
community - along with the
impending theatrical release of
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince" just weeks later - the vid-
eos became an instant sensation.
At the time, Walker was mak-
ing a road trip from Los Angeles to
New York and deciding which city
to settle in.
"Literallythe day after I left L.A.
they put it up on YouTube, and by
the time I got into New York, it had
300,000 views," Walker said.
Other cast members couldn't
stay away from the computer, con-
stantly checking the number of
views.
"Every day, I was like, 'Oh, but
this is where people will forget
about us,' "Lopez said. "Everytime
the numbers went up and up and
up onthe views, I thought, 'Butcthis
is the cap. It can't get any higher,'
and it kept going."
The true brunt of their fame hit
the cast later that summer when
some of the actors decided to go
to the "Harry Potter" convention
Azkatraz in San Francisco.
"Right as we walked into the
main entrance there were people
who knew us," said 2009 alum
Dylan Saunders, who played
Dumbledore in the "Potter" musi-
cals. "It was very jarring ... they
hadthis'I've seen you on YouTube'
kind of aura."
Holden, who co-wrote all the
StarKid productions and played
Remus Lupin in "A Very Potter
Sequel," recalled an impromptu
performance they did at the con-
vention.
"One day, Darren had his guitar,
and we did a little sing-along with
50 people," Holden said. "And we
were like '50 people, holy shit!' We
were just thrilled ... that had never
happened to us before."
It was eerily familiar, this sud-
den realization that people knew
who these University students
were - it almost seemed to paral-
lel Harry's revelation in "Sorcerer's
Stone" that everyone in the wiz-

arding community knew who he
was.
The production originally had
the generic moniker, "Harry Pot-
ter, the Musical," But when the

Last February marked the premiereof StarKid's first independent production, "Starship."

videos were uploaded on YouTube,
StarKid discovered the name broke
copyright laws, so the videos were
taken down and retitled "A Very
Potter Musical."
This was also around the
time the group took on the name
StarKid. The YouTube user name
and Twitter handle were created
as "StarKidPotter," a reference
to Draco's line in "A Very Potter
Musical": "Look at this, look at
rocket ship Potter! Starkid Potter,
moon shoes Potter, traversing the
galaxy for intergalactic travels to
Pigfarts!" The name stuck.
Fall came, and the creative forc-
es behind the production wanted
to tap into this newfound fame and
momentum. The newly dubbed
Team StarKid put on the musical
"Me and My Dick" in October 2009,
starring Richter as a (presumably)
fictional version of himself and
Walker as his titular appendage.
The show was based on a rough
version called "The Penis Play" cre-
ated during the annual "24 Hour
Theater" display in fall 2008.
The soundtrack to "Me and My
Dick" was a raging success, debut-
ing on the Billboard Top Cast
Album chart at number 11. More
importantly, it proved StarKid had
an audience beyond what its mem-
bers had imagined.
"That was like,'Oh, they're actu-
ally looking at our other work, and
it's not just Harry Potter-related,' "
said 2010 alum Jamie Lyn Beatty,
who played Sally in the show. "'Me
and My Dick' is as far as you can get
from a Harry Potter musical, and
we still got people tuning in and
watching and singing the songs
and listening to the album."
The nextstep was "A Very Potter
Sequel," continuingthe adventures
of Harry, Ron and Herman - par-
don - Hermione through song and
dance. And though StarKid was
now on the map, the group didn't
fret about higher expectations.
"The first one was such a fuck-
around, (it was hard to imagine)
the idea that now there's an expec-
tation," Walker said. "If such a
high bar was set by accident, you
go, 'Can't be that hard of a bar to
meet.'"
"A Very Potter Sequel" was per-
formed in May 2010, with produc-
tion starting after classes ended so
the student cast members could
rehearse and perform without
schoolwork on their minds. The
video forthe sequel premiered later
that summer at the Harry Potter
convention Infinitus in Orlando,
eternally gracing the world with
Severus "Butt Trumpet" Snape
(2009 alum Joe Moses) and Walker
as uber-man Umbridge.

To Chicago and beyond
When the Potter sequel was
done, the future of StarKid wasn't
immediately clear.
"We were all pretty depressed,"
Beatty said. "We were like, 'Gosh,
we are at our happiestwhen we're
with each other and when we're
performing these shows ... In an
ideal world wouldn't it be won-
derful if we could all create a
mini-Ann Arbor somewhere else,
just do these shows for the rest of
our lives?'"
These wishes soon came true,
as members of Starkid decided
to take a giant leap and continue
the company beyond the Univer-
sity. Last fall, members relocated
to Chicago a city with an estab-
lished, youth-driven theater scene
and a relatively affordable life-
style, and where members could
focus on productions rather than
balance full-time jobs to pay rent.
StarKid's first independent
production premiered last Febru-
ary, a "Starship Troopers"-riffing
space odyssey called "Starship."
The show continued the streak of
success, selling out within a mat-
ter of days, but the professional
world came with brand new chal-
lenges.
"It was the first time we had
to rent the theater, we had to
insure the theater, first time we
had to pay the actors and design
a full-fledged set," Saunders said.
"There were a lot of ingredients
that ... we had to suddenly come
up with on our own."
This past summer, StarKid
returned to Orlando for the
"Harry Potter" convention Leak-
yCon, performing for a crowd of
almost 3,000 fans - a nice bump
from the audience of50 two years
ago. In the spring, the group per-
formed alongside the Gregory
Brothers of "Double Rainbow"
fame, and the fun of the mini-
tour inspired StarKid to put on a
tour of its own.
After the opening night of
the S.P.A.C.E. tour tomorrow,
StarKid will continue on to 14

cites, concluding in New York
City and reuniting with Criss for
that performance. The tour fea-
tures a cast of seven including
Lopez, Richter, Walker, Saun-
ders, Holden, Beatty and 2009
alum Meredith Stepien. To open
each leg ofthe tour, they're bring-
ing along 2009 alum and singer
Charlene Kaye and her band.
"This is a chance for usto real-
ly celebrate what we've been able
to do over the last three years,
to celebrate the fans and thank
them," Albain said. "We couldn't
do it if we didn't have this incred-
ible fan base."
As Richter noted, StarKid's
ability to fill a void in the heart
of Harry Potter fandom led to its
initial success.
"Our play kind of came around
at this really opportune time to
garner a fan base, because it's a
fan base looking for more things
to be a fan of," he said. "We came
at this pristine moment where it
was like 'Man, all the books are
done, we have nothing else ... But
what is this?'"
StarKid provided that some-
thing else, an enchanting experi-
ence made for fans by fans - the
tenets for triumph in today's viral
video world. The viral platform
is a medium in which stars van-
ish as quickly as they appear, but
StarKid has sustained its suc-
cess by tapping into the hearts
of its fans. For starters, the term
"StarKid" refers not only to the
members of the performance
troupe, but to its fans as well.
"We call (the fans) StarKid,
they call us StarKid," Holden
said. "It really does help break
down the separation between
us."
The legacy of StarKid is yet
unwritten - part of it may be the
"Potter" musicals, part of it may
be "Me and My Dick" or another
gut-busting musical in the future
- but much of it will certainly be
about the group's role as torch-
bearer in a world where the divi-
sion between fan and creator is
increasingly indistinguishable.
