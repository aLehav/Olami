Students protest cuts
to scholarships and
financial aid
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
Students from the University
and Michigan State University
gathered on the steps of the Michi-
gan State Capitol in Lansing July
23 to protest the state's move to cut
the Michigan Promise Scholarship
and need-based financial aid.
The event was co-hosted by
the Michigan Student Assembly
and the Associated Students of
Michigan State University, MSU's
undergraduate student govern-
ment. More than a dozen repre-
sentatives from both universities
attended the protest, along with
government officials.
Kyle Dysarz, ASMSU student
assembly chairperson, opened
with a remark that addressed how
the present issues concerning

higher education are so impor-
tant that they brought two rival
schools together.
"It is not every day that you
will find a Spartan and a Wolver-
ine standing peacefully alongside
each other," Dysarz said.
Dysarz said he has heard
numerous stories about the stu-
dents and families who may not be
able to afford college tuition if the
state continues to slash higher-
education funds.
"The reason that we're here is
to talk about a struggling battle for
all students - no matter if you're
a Wolverine or a Spartan - (that
we) can't afford to lose," he said.
MSU raised its tuition 5.2 per-
cent for the 2009-2010 schoolyear,
while the University increased
tuition 5.6 percent.
Meanwhile, in a move to
decrease the state's estimated
$1.7-billion deficit, the Michigan
Senate passed a bill on June 23
that cuts the Michigan Prom-
ise Scholarship, which provides

Rare books for sale in'U' deal with Amazon

400,000 out-of-print
books available
By TORREYARMSTRONG
Daily StaffReporter
A partnership between the
University and BookSurge - a
Seattle-based subsidiary of Ama-
zon.com, Inc. - will introduce

thousands of rare and out-of-print
books to a new era of readers.
On Tuesday, University librar-
ies revealed plans to make
400,000 out-of-copyright books
in their collection available for
reprint on demand through a
partnership with BookSurge.
The books, which the University
expects to make available later
this summer, will range from $10

to $45.
The reprint program will

ship with online seller Amazon.
com, which has been offering a
limited selection of books to the
University for about five years.
The agreement between the Uni-
versity and Amazon states that
the program will last two years.
Dean of Libraries Paul Cou-

rant said the project would focus
mainly on works published prior
to 1923 because they are no longer
protected under copyright law.
Courant added that the project
would slowly add more recent
out-of-print and out-of-copyright
books.
Courant said revenue sharing

approximately $140 million to
96,000 students across the state.
The bill also eliminates nearly $56
million in need-based financial aid.
Last Wednesday, Republicans in
theHouseofRepresentativesformed
a different set of bills in an attempt
to avoid using stimulus funds to
reduce the state's deficit. The plan
would keep the Michigan Promise
Scholarship but would eradicate
other scholarship and financial
aid programs such as work-study
programs and the Michigan Com-
petitive Scholarships - which are
awarded to students based on merit,
financial need and ACT scores.
MSA President Abhishek Mahan-
ti spoke to the crowd and discussed
how the combination of increasing
tuition rates and decreasing finan-
cial aid negatively impacts all fami-
lies, including his own. He said that
his family has to pay tuition bills for
him and his brother, who will be an
incoming freshman at the Univer-
sity this fall.
"Even with the in-state rates in
Ann Arbor, these costs have been
difficult to handle, and like most
families, we're trying to make it all
fit together," Mahanti said.
He added that the proposed cut
of the Michigan Promise Scholar-
ship is disturbing, and would break
a promise made to tens of thou-
sands of students who each count on
receiving as much as $4,000 in aid.
"It financially awarded high aca-
demic performance and provided
relief for families like mine that don't
qualify for financial aid but are still
felng this ni-ch" Maan+ti sad

Mary Clark, chief of staff for Rep.
Joan Bauer (D-Lansing), attended
the protest and agreed with the
student speakers. She said the gov-
ernment should honor the promise
grants because they act as incen-
tives to increase the number of col-
lege graduates in the state.
"We believe that at this criti-
cal time in Michigan's history it is
counterproductive to cut the area
that is critical to our state's econom-
ic recovery," Clark said. "We know
that the prosperity of our state and
our citizens is directly connected
to the number of college graduates
that we have in our state."
Susan Schmidt, chief of staff for
Rep. Mark Meadows (D-East Lan-
sing), said she and Meadows also
support continuing funding for the
scholarship.
"These scholarshipshelpfamilies
afford the ever-increasing tuition,
and as a mother of two college stu-
dents who go to U of M ... we are feel-
ing a direct effect by these potential
decisions," said Schmidt, addressing
the group of students from the capi-
tol steps.
Mahanti said students attend-
ing college are Michigan's greatest
assets becausethey arethe ones who
will lead the state in the future.
"Legislatures must realize that
investing in our students through
education isn't just important - it's
imperative," he said. "Education
needs to be accessible to prospective
scholars in the state of Michigan,
and by going beyond higher educa-
tion by encouraging entrepreneur-
ship and developing new businesses
within the state, we beginto reverse
this brain drain that plagues our
nation and our state."

as an opportunity for legislators to
hear students' concerns, MSA and
ASMSU will be working together
in the coming weeks to take further
action on the issues of statewide
tuition hikes and Promise Scholar-
ship funding. ASMSU has posted
petitions on Facebook and Twitter
for all Michigan students to sign,
and leaders from both organizations
will be calling and visiting local rep-
resentatives, urging them to main-
tain higher education funding.
Ambreen Sayed, MSA chief of
staff, said she attended the event to
make the state aware that because
of the current economic situation
the government's greatest invest-
ment should be in higher education.
"When better to start investing in
the best and the brightest than right
now?" she said.
She added she came to show sup-
port for continuing the Promise
Scholarship and making sure the
state keeps on funding Michigan's
world-renowned institutions.
LSA senior Brady Smith went to
the- evebeause he .istfee with

the legislature's decision to revoke
its promise made to students in
Michigan.
He said retracting the scholar-
ships and financial aid will cause
students to attend school elsewhere
and not return to Michigan during a
time when the state needs people to
stay more than ever because of the
economic problems associated with
the automotive industries.
"Some of these manufacturing
jobs aren't coming back, but they
can be replaced with vocational and
technical training, and the fact that
we're preventing people from pur-
suing that is a big problem," Smith
said.
He added that public education
existed about 20years before Michi-
gan even became a state, considering
that the University was established
in 1817 and Michigan became a state
in 1837.
"This state has long been com-
mitted to excellent higher educa-
tion, and it's a sad day in this state
when we see that scaled back,"

ManagingNews Editor
The family of former construc-

Business construction site last
August, is suing the University for

will likely be based on page length.
While the reprinting and sell-
ing of out-of-print reproductions is
common, Courant said the program
is still unprecedented.
"Nobodyelse has done this on the
scale that we have because nobody
has digitized as many books as we

Smith was an elevator mechanic
from Grass Lake who died at age
31 after falling five stories down
an empty elevator shaft at the con-
struction site on Aug. 4, 2008.
At the construction site, Smith
was responsible for moving work-
ers and their equipment from floor
to floor.
Smith's mother, Mary Lee Smith,
filed the lawsuit in April. Smith is
asking for more than $25,000 in
damages from the University and
six other defendants, including
Smith's employer Schindler Eleva-
tor Corporation, general contractor
Barton-Malow Company and Shaw
have," he said.
Courant said University librar-
ies began digitizing their collec-
tion along with Cornell University
in a 1995 project called Making of
America, which specialized in pre-
serving antebellum and Recon-
struction-era texts. Since then, the
University has digitized approxi-
mately 7 million volumes on its
own and through large-scale digi-
tization efforts with Google, which
commenced in 2005.

Electric Company - the company
that provided lighting at the site.
According to Smith's complaint,
the University owned the prop-
erty, premises and building of the
Stephen M. Ross School of Busi-
ness during construction and "had
a non-delegable duty to assure
compliance with all industry and
government standards, codes and
regulations." The complaint further
states that the University had a duty
to assure that any dangerous con-
ditions were recognized and cor-
rected. Such dangerous conditions
included inadequate lighting for the
elevator shaft, elevator car and ele-
He added that Google would
receive a portion of the profits
derived from sales of the books it
has digitized from the University's
recent deal with BookSurge.
BookSurge Spokeswoman
Amanda Wilson told The Associ-
ated Press on Tuesday that other
universities and prestigious librar-
ies have followed suit - including
Emory University, the University of
Maine and the Toronto and Cincin-
nati public libraries - and began

vator lobbies, which she claims the
University did not provide.
Brian Benner, the attorney rep-
resenting Smith's family, said the
elevator shaft was not properly lit.
To turn on the lights in the eleva-
tor shaft, Smith was required
to open the elevator doors, step
inside of the elevator, turn around
and turn a key.
"Safety always starts at the top
and not at the bottom," said Benner,

responsibility of the oversight com-
mittees and companies in charge of
the site to ensure safety at the site
- not that of the workers.

ects with BookSurge in 2007.
"Public and university libraries
are seeing the benefits of print-
on-demand as an economic and
environmentally conscious way to
support their missions of preserv-
ing and making rare or out-of-copy-
right material broadly available to
the public," she said.
Maria Bonn, director of the Uni-
versity library's Scholarly Publish-
ing Office, wrote in a press release

"Somebody's not enforcingsafety
at these job sites," he added.
The University responded ear-
lier this month, asserting that it
was not in possession and control of
the property during construction,
and the University was therefore
not responsible for the death. The
University's legal statement also
maintains that Smith was "more
than 50 percent responsible for the
accident of his death," meaning that
Smith was partially responsible for
the fall by not using proper safety
measures.

Courant agreed, adding that
making a profit is a secondary
objective of the project.
"We don't expect best sellers,
but there will be an intermittent
demand for books, and being able to
fulfill that demand is a good thing,"
he said.

Banking on success
Land Bank offers opportunity for community development
These tumultuous economic times have paved the path for a new
brand of banking in Washtenaw County - one free of deposit
slips and PINs. Say hello to the Land Bank. A surge of foreclo-
sures caused by the recession has burdened local communities with
unused properties that are inefficient and diminish the value of nearby
properties. The freshly-formed Washtenaw County Land Bank Author-
ity is sure to help with this problem. To do that, the Land Bank should
concentrate on providing affordable housing for county residents and
encourage important environmentally friendly initiatives.

Ethics always affect
consumer decisions
TO THE DAILY:
Last week, Jeremy Levy argued
that"single producer-to-consumer
transactions" should be morality-
free zones where "our sense of
social responsibility shouldn'tmat-
ter" (Not buying it, 07/19/2009).
Whether or not Americans have a
responsibility to purchase Ameri-
can cars, Levy's principle goes
too far. What about the exchange
of cash for a product immunizes
participants from the ethical con-
sequences of their actions?
Levy's claim that consumers
should maximize their own per-
sonal benefit in any transaction is
itself a kind of ethical principle -
and a selfish one at that. The issue
isn't whether or not ethics should
govern our economic behavior,
butwhich ethics should influence
our decisions.
Daniel Trump
Law School
Corruption claims
lack real credibility
TO THE DAILY:
In his latest column on the
corruption of the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency, Patrick
Zabawa's first sentence is, "as
a reader, you expect the news
stories in this newspaper to be
balanced and unbiased" (The cov-
er-ups continue, 07/13/2009). Had
Zabawa used these themes as his
guide and bothered to dosa Google
search, he would have found that
John Davidson and Alan Carlin,
who authored a report on global

warming discarded by the EPA on
global warming that Zabawa ref-
erenced, aren't climate scientists.
I found and read the "gagged"
draft report. In summary, it
immediately states that the
report's theoriestcould be
wrong. The main theme is that
the Earth's climate is so incred-
ibly complex that the possibil-
ity exists that man-made carbon
dioxide increases may not be the
sole cause of global warming.
Until we know for sure, I would
allow that this is possible, but the
General Secretary of The World
Meteorological Organization
wrote in response, "It is a misin-
terpretation of the data and of sci-
entific knowledge to point to one
year as the warmest on record...
and then to extrapolate that cool-
er subsequent years invalidate
the reality of global warming and
its effects."
I am disgusted that the jour-
nalistic ethics and ideals I stud-
ied at the University are being
corrupted by the likes of Fox
News and writers more inter-
ested in a political agenda than in
the truth.
All governments are going to
suffer corruption at some point.
That is expected. But, the exam-
ple provided in Zabawa's column
is weak at best.
That said, the "gagged" report
and subsequent media spin
achieved its right wing goal of
injecting FUD (Fear, Uncertainty,
and Doubt) into the debate on the
environment as Obama tries to
move this country toward agreen,
energy-independent future that
big oil corporations oppose.
Now there's a place for a good
journalist to look for political
corruption.

The Washtenaw County Land
Bank was established on July 8,
just in time to meet the dead-
line to receive $300,000 in fed-
eral stimulus funds to help with
start-up costs. A specific busi-
ness plan has yet to be gener-
ated, but the Washtenaw Land
Bank will probably follow a fair-
ly standard model. Generally,
after acquiring foreclosed prop-
erties, land banks collaborate
with local officials to determine
their best use on a case-by-case
basis. This could mean renova-
tion, demolition, beautification
or other projects. Properties are
then sold to private owners who
agree to develop the land along
the land bank's suggestion.
The Washtenaw Lank Bank
is expected to be modeled after
the Genesee County Land Bank,
which has earned the 2007
Harvard University/Fannie
Mae Foundation Innovations in
American Government Award for
Affordable Housing. The over-
all impact of the Genesee Land
Bank has been overwhelmingly

positive - Genesee has produced
a cost-conscious program that
softened the blow of the Flint
area housing crisis. There is no
reason why Washtenaw County
can't replicate this success.
But for the Lank Bank to work
here, officials will have to tai-
lor its objectives to Washtenaw
County's needs and values. For
example, here in Ann Arbor,
students and residents alike
have long been in need of more
affordable rental units. Afford-
able housing located centrally
in downtown Ann Arbor helps
combat socioeconomic strati-
fication in the city. It allows
people of various means to live
in close proximity, rather than
forcing the less fortunate to live
further from the city proper
and commute. And if the Land
Bank takes initiative to encour-
age the development of this kind
of affordable housing, the city
wouldn't have to foot the bill.
Local residents and especially
students have also expressed
their enthusiasm for more envi-
Editorial Board Members:

ronmentally friendly initiatives.
The Land Bank could support
this cause by encouraging pri-
vate owners to include features
approved by the U.S. Green
Building Council's Leadership
in Energy and Environmental
Design program. Perhaps even
environmentally friendly high-
rises could be on the Land Bank's
agenda -- these could also facili-
tate low-income housing.
And even less functional uses
- like vegetable gardens or play-
grounds -could prevent further
degradation of the already bur-
dened housing market by turn-
ing blighted properties that
pull down property value into
useful spaces.
This project has potential.
But the officials in charge of the
project should proceed with cau-
tion - wasteful uses of property
or delayed development could be
disastrous. It's up to the officials
in charge of the Land Bank to
make sure this doesn't happen
and see that the project creates
the facilities the city needs.

E-MAIL CHRIS AT CSKOSLOW@UMICH.EDU

Irecentlyran into a family friend
at a coffee shop. After covering
all the important hometown
gossip, our dis-
cussion turned
to the future of
health care. As a
psychologist, my _
friend expressed
concern that '
in all the talk _
about reform- MATTHEW
ing the healthG
care system, she GREEN
hadn't heard of
any plans for mental health cover-
age. As someone who has seen the
positive effect of psychotherapy in
people's lives, I was disappointed
to find out that insurance providers
place inadequate value on it. Later, a
Google search suggested that there
isn't a provision for universal men-
tal health care in the works.
In the threefold healthcare plan
that President Barack Obama has
outlined, "prevention" is the third
step in improving the health care
paradigm, after insurance reform
and technology advancement. But
while "prevention" is illustrated
rather thoroughly on baracko-
bama.com - better nutrition, can-
cer screenings, electronic health
records, etc. - the plan entirely
disregards the nexus between men-
tal well-being and physical health.
According to the American Psycho-
logical Association's website, "50
to 70 percent of visits to primary
care physicians are for medical
complaints that stem from psycho-
logical factors." These factors are
primarily depression and anxiety.
That figure might sound ridicu-
lous. But when you consider that
health concerns ranging from blood
pressure and ulcers to acne often
have a psychological root, those
numbers mightnotactually seem so
absurd. Patients confuse these mal-
adies as purely physiological prob-
lems - but these issues are really
psychological in nature. Rather
than searching for a physical reme-
dy, the more prudent decision might
be to take a psychological approach.
Such a solution might even end up
beingcheaper in the long run with-
out the costs of exams, medical
technology and physical treatment,
somethingObama's healthcareplan
should consider.
Even current private insurers
rarely provide adequate coverage
for mental health care. Many insur-
ance plans cap mental health care
much more strictly than physical
health maintenance. A comprehen-
sive plan for health reform should
include coverage for the treat-

ment of mental illness and ought
to set limits for such treatment on
par with limits on physical medi-
cal care. In other words, a patient
should not have unlimited visits to a
physician but only 15 lifetime visits
to a mental health professional.
And the sad irony is that the least
financially fortunate, who are more
prone than others to mental illness
given their destitution, are often
faced with meager or no insurance
coverage for mental care. These are
people who need comprehensive
health care plans the most and are
the least able to obtain it.
Setting aside socioeconomic dis-
parities and psychosomatic condi-
tions -both ofwhichareimportant
health care realities - there are two
additional relevant problems when
it comes to psychological affects on
physical health: substance abuse
and obesity. These problems are
widespread in the U.S., and are
largely caused by mental vulner-
ability. It would seem that in the
government's quest to eliminate
health costs through "prevention,"
minimizing obesity and substance
abuse should be relatively easy to
facilitate through appropriate psy-
chological attention.
Mental health
care is not
expendenable.
In all the discussion about health
care and the government, it seems
that mental health care has been
ignored by both sides. Maybe it's
because psychotherapy is often dif-
ficult to understand or believe, or
perhaps politicians and pundits are
too myopic to think outside the box
about health care reform in gen-
eral. But as universal health care
becomes more and more likely, psy-
chological well-being needs to be
thrown into the debate.
It may be that by remaining
vague, Obama was hoping to pro-
vide Congress with a basic frame-
work upon which the legislature
might create a balanced plan that
would be more likely to pass into
law. NowthatCongressisgoinginto
recess during August, all congress-
men ought to meticulously deliber-
ate on health care reform and take
the time to think seriously about
mental health care. They'd have to
be nuts not to.

A pplying to graduate
schools is a frustrating
task. It's made even more
infuriating
when you're an
international
student who
doesn't quali-
fy for federal
financial aid,
like me. And-
at a time when EMAD
local assistance ANSARI
programs like
the Michigan
Promise Zone Scholarship are
under threat, it's even harder to
draw attention to the financial
woes of international students.
It's pertinent to mention - and
easy to forget - that the effects
of the economic climate stretch
past national boundaries and
affect the ability to afford tuition
of prospective international stu-
dents and local students alike.
Unless international students are
provided even limited access to
scholarships and financial assis-
tance, the University will find
its international student popula-
tion dwindling and the quality of
overseas applicants declining.
When I applied to college, my
high school classmates bemoaned
the University's aid policy toward
international students. Many who
found themselves excluded from
the pool of funds opted for liberal
arts colleges like Carleton College
and Macalester College in Min-
nesota - both of which offered
significant scholarship opportu-
nities for overseas applicants.
The lack of funding opportu-
nities means that the University
attracts a certain type of inter-
national student - one with
the ability to pay the burgeon-
ing tuition fees the institution
demands. Cast in that light, inter-
national students are mistakenly
perceived as deep-pocketed and
unworthy. But while academic

standards dispel that image and
help maintain a minimum stan-
dard of excellence, a complete
absence of substantial financial
assistance deters even more qual-
ified prospective applicants.
Those who do attend find
themselves trimmingthe edges of
their degree programs. By either
accepting credits for advanced
high school courses or overload-
ing on courses, financially con-
strained students attempt to
graduate ahead of time. Caught
in a frenzied attempt to cut four
years in college down to three,
these students relinquish the tre-
mendous opportunities offered
on campus.
On top of rushed degrees,
international students are forced
to work or apply for student loans.
And while that's not unusual for
college students, the burden on
international students is consid-
erably higher. Most international
students arrive onF-1visas, which
prohibit off-campus employment,
and the search for work-study
employment opportunities is
arduous in a limited market. In
addition, most University-affili-
ated employers specify national-
ity or permanent residence in the
United States as prerequisites for
vacant jobs.
High-interest loans, in turn,
are hardly viable options for
already-burdened students.
Repaying loans restricts options
for graduates - international stu-
dents must work in the U.S. rather
than return home to contribute in
their own countries.
It's not surprising that inter-
national students haven't made
a concerted effort to obtain
aid from the University. Such
demands would be countered
with a barrage of retorts, partic-
ularly in the current recession. A
public university awarding funds
to international students when
in-state students sweat for finan-

cial aid would be accused of mis-
placed priorities.
But consider my proposition
- five significant scholarships
exclusively earmarked for inter-
national students, based both on
financial need and merit. That's
hardly an outrageous request.
Granted, the extremely limited
scholarships would not ease the
financial woes of all international
students, but they would gener-
ate a more competitive pool of
applicants and provide a prece-
dent for international students to
build upon and rally around.
International
students can't
find funding.
More importantly, the assis-
tance would protect global repre-
sentationoncampus,particularlyif
offered along country-specific cri-
teria. Each year, the London School
of Economics and Political Science
awards renewable yearly scholar-
ships to students from Mauritius,
Pakistan, Israel, Brazil and Hong
Kong. In Ann Arbor, the number
of freshmen from less represented
states like Bangladesh or Egypt
isn't likely to increase unless stu-
dents are provided some codified
incentive by the University.
Denied financial aid and fea-
sible scholarships, international
students are forced into restric-
tive options that inhibit both
their college experience and
future prospects. Unless this
burden is eased, representation
is protected and more qualified
applicants are attracted, only an
isolated few will benefit from a
University education.

stated that the University did not
have "actual or constructive notice
of a defect of a public building" and
therefore could not "take action to
protect the public against the con-
dition."
Smith's death was one of three
fatal construction accidents on
campus in the last 16 months.
University Spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham wrote in an e-mail
interview that Smith's death was
an unfortunate event that has
been difficult for the many parties
involved to cope with and that the
University is still dealing with the
legal process regarding the law-
suit.
"This is a difficult situation for
everyone, and the University is
working through the court process
on the legal matters," she wrote.
Representatives from the Mich-
igan Occupational Safety and
Health Administration investi-
gated Smith's death and concluded
that Schindler Elevator Company
failed to make employees aware of
an accident prevention program,
adequately inspect the construc-
tion site for hazardous conditions
and enforce that all employeeswear
protective helmets while entering
and leaving the work site. MIOSHA
issued three fines to the company
totaling $9,400 on Dec. 12.

Male gusto can't save chick flick

Despite avoiding some genre
cliches, 'The Ugly Truth' suffers
from a weak, predictable script
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
In an overtly generic romantic comedy, the female pro-
tagonist inevitably wins the battle against the stereotypical
bawdiness of her male lover, either through
manipulation and cunning or with tender-
ness and passion. This formula, albeit posi-
tively received by the female moviegoer, is
often an emasculating experience for her
male companion. This unfortunate out- TIht
come is so often repeated that it debases At Qualityl6
most romantic films to the dubious label of and Showcase
chick flick. This is not the case in "The Ugly
Truth." Columbia
The film follows Abby Richter (Kather-
ine Heigl, "Knocked Up"), a local television
producer living in Sacramento whose obsessive-compulsive
approach to dating would induce nausea in even the most
stoic man alive.
One night, an extraordinary accident leads to Richter
engaging in an awkward telephone conversation with the
uncouth (to say the least) host of a public access television
show. Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler, "300") espouses his

simplistic, sexualized take on love in his show FILM R
"The Ugly Truth."
His chauvinism immediately offends Rich-
ter's fragile temperament, and she is horrified
the following day when she finds out that the
manager of her local television network has
invited Chadway to move his show to their net-
work. Chaos ensues as Richter is caught in an ,v
inelegant love triangle.
"The Ugly Truth" is filled with glaring flaws.
The weak script consigns Heigl's and Butler's
characters to complete one-dimensionality:
Anna's "humor" involves rambling rants that,
however verbally eloquent, amount to little
more than an annoying buzz in the ears of
the viewer. Mike's brand of humor is equally
contrived, and his chauvinist characteristics
almost perfectly parallel those of Frank T.J.
Mackey (Tom Cruise) in the film "Magnolia."
Coincidence? I think not. "This is madn
Also worth a mention are the poorly devised
visuals, which employ the use of backdrops so obviously fake
the film looks like it was produced in the 1940s.
But despite the film's pitfalls, it breaks some of the chick-
flick genre's conventions. Certain expectations must be fore-
gone in an era of filmmaking in which the focal point is the
bottom line rather than fresh material. "The Ugly Truth" may
not give viewers a script ofunadulterated originality, but it still
earns a position slightly above the typical romantic comedy.
Though the outcome is altogether predictable, the film

ess!" "No! This is A VERY NICE PARK!"
manages to offer a fresh, unexpectedly crass viewpoint that
rewards viewers with a healthy number of laugh-worthy
moments. It's nice to see a romance that doesn't entail a bum-
bling man who's constantly being outwitted by a member of
the "smarter sex."
More importantly, the film addresses the troubling, cynical
outlook on love that has been adopted by contemporary male
culture and is all too often overlooked - though it's a shame
that it can't present the concept in a more thoughtful manner.

Polite hipsters at Pitchfork

By JEFF SANFORD
Senior Arts Editor
To begin, a corny - but, in a roundabout
way, thought-provoking - joke I heard
while attending this year's Pitchfork Music
Festival:
Q: "How many hipsters does it take to
screw in a lightbulb?"
A: "It's a pretty obscure number. You've
probably never heard of it."
This joke was met with groans and blank
stares, plus one "shutup." ButI'mnot includ-
ing it because it's funny. Rather, ithelps clar-
ify why I was a little apprehensive about this
year's Pitchfork Music Festival.
Fact: The bulk of Pitchfork's audience was
comprised of late-teens and twenty-some-
things in various stages of hipsterdom. I saw
enough plaid and flannel shirts to wallpaper
the Sistine Chapel - hipsters as far as thy
eye could see.
In effect, the Pitchfork Festival, housed
in Chicago's Union Park, was a giant conflu-
ence of people who - as the joke reminds
us - pride themselves on obscurity and
smug eccentricity. I had thought that at
some point during the festival, a lot of these
people would take a look around and real-
ize they resembled practically everyone else
around them. They would become aware
that they weren't as unconventional as they
once thought.
And herein lies the seeming paradox that
had bothered me in the days preceding the
festival. How can Pitchfork cater to its audi-
ence if it inherently contradicts everything
they stand for?
Fortunately, there was no evidence of an
identity-crisis pandemic in Union Park. In
fact, the paradox I'd been contemplating
beforehand dissolved as soon as I entered
the festival grounds Friday evening.
To be sure, the crowd at Pitchfork had
to be one of the most reasonable, polite and

generally caring crowds ever assembled in musicianship of the festival.

Burgoon has All-Star experience

Wolverine pitcher
dominates summer
Cape Cod League
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
BOSTON - It was tough to pick
junior Tyler Burgoon out of the
crowd of baseball players huddled
around Fenway Park's third base
dugout on Thursday.
All of the Cape Cod Baseball
League players on hand for the
Cape League All-Star Game were
dressed in similar warm-up jerseys
- and all had ear-to-ear grins on
their faces.
Burgoon was no exception.
Even as the pre-game drizzle
turned into a steady rain and the

Burgoon couldn't wipe that smile
from his face.
The right-handed Wolverine,
like many other players on that
field Thursday, was simply thrilled
to be on the field at a big-league
park. The fact that it was Fenway,
a cathedral of incredible baseball
history - well, that was simply
icing on the cake.
"I walked up, went through a lit-
tle hallway and just saw the field,"
Burgoon said, with an awestruck
glance at the infield before the
game. "It was pretty nice to know
that I was going to be pitching from
that mound."
Unfortunately for the Cape Cod
League and half of its All-Star
pitching staff, rain prevented the
All-Star game from continuing past
the fifth inning. After four and a
half innings, and a 3-0 lead by the
Western Division, the game was

called due to rain and poor field
conditions.
Burgoon was one ofnine unlucky
pitchers who didn't get a chance to
throw his inning from the Fenway
mound.
As a closer for the Yarmouth-
Dennis Red Sox, Burgoon has
posted a league-leading 11 saves,
giving up just one earned run in 15
appearances (through July 26). His
30 strikeouts to six walks in 19.3
innings ranks him among the best
pitchers in the league.
So it was understandable that
Eastern Division All-Star man-
ager Steve Englert would be saving
Burgoon for the late innings of last
Thursday's game - the innings that
ended up being rained out.
"Before Thursday's game start-
ed, during the national anthem and
introductions, (Vanderbilt closer)
Russell Brewer looked over at
me, and he was like, 'No chance,"'
Burgoon said yesterday of Thurs-
day's game. "We were throwing
the eighth and the ninth. There
was no chance. We kind of knew it
wasn't going to happen. It was nice
that they let the game get played as
much as it did, though."
And even without pitching, Bur-
goon had a pretty busy and exciting
day. Thursday began with a 9:30
a.m. bus trip from Barnstable to
Boston, about a 90-minute drive.
Burgoon and the other All-Stars
went out to lunch in the city and
sat through a brief lecture by the
Boston Red Sox scouting director.
The highlight for many players
that night came when they arrived
at the ballpark -- a tour of historic
Fenway Park.
Preparations for the actual
All-Star game followed -- getting
dressed, shagging balls during

Junior Tyler Burgoon had an ERA hovering near five last season, but in the Cape C.
League this summer, he's found his stride, leading the league in saves as a closer.

batting practice and the pre-game
home run hitting contest.
Pitchers claimed it was the first
time they'd ever gotten excited to
field balls in the outfield during
batting practice. Burgoon said he
was shocked and that he enjoyed
seeingrteammates "yoke" it out over
the Green Monster.
Thursday marked Burgoon's
second trip to Fenway this summer.
The Defiance, Ohio, native attend-
ed a Red Sox game a few weeks ago
as a fan, calling it the best experi-
ence he's ever had at a major league
baseball park.

He will go again this Thursday
for the Cape League All-Star appre-
ciation afternoon game.
Even with the disappointment
that accompanied not pitching in
the All-Star game, Burgoon still took
away the positives from his experi-
ence. What mattered was that he
was honored as an All-Star, and even
more important, he got to take the
field at Fenway among the most tal-
ented players in the Cape League.
"Some of the best players in the
nation are here," Burgoon said yes-
terday. "Even just getting to play
with them is great."
