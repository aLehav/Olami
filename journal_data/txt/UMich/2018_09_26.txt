Defying stereotypes about 

college students’ preference 
for loungewear, one can find 
students sporting suits at any 
given day at the Ross School 
of Business Building. With a 
sleek, modern exterior and an 
interior that hosts a private 
gym, cafeteria and frequent 
visists from top recruiters, 
some students have remarked 
that 
the 
building 
itself 

resembles 
a 
traditional 

business atmosphere.

Belying 
the 
Business 

School’s traditional business 
image, however, is a school 
that considers one of its 

core 
values 
to 
bepositive 

business. While this may be 
a core value, some students 
have 
noted 
classes 
and 

recruitment 
efforts 
seem 

to focus heavily on finance, 
consulting 
and 
marketing 

opportunities, leaving those 
who are pursuing a business 
degree to enter other social 
impact or nonprofit careers 
disappointed.

Jamie Jacobson joined Ross 

as a pre-admitted freshman, 
hoping to use her business 
degree in work with nonprofit 
or 
political 
advocacy 

organizations.

“The original impression I 

got was that it was sort of this 
new age, more progressive 

Tuesday night, the University 

of Michigan Central Student 
Government 
convened 
to 

discuss goals for the semester, 
including promoting inclusivity 
and enhancing communication 
on campus. The CSG session 
confirmed 
12 
members 
for 

various leadership positions.

The meeting began with a 

presentation from Erik Wessel, 
the director of the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution, on 
the amendment cycle for the 
Statement of Student Rights 
and 
Responsibilities. 
Wessel 

explained OSCR is in the process 
of bringing proposals to amend 
this statement, noting how the 
statement has always been and 
will continue to be shaped by the 
University community.

“I should mention that the 

statement itself has always been a 
community-owned, community-
amended, 
community-crafter 

document from its inception,” 
Wessel said.

Wessel 
also 
encouraged 

students 
to 
attend 
OSCR’s 

conflict 
skills 
education 

workshops, such as Conflict 
Resolution 101 or Nonviolent 
Communication.

“Feel free to reach out to 

OSCR,” Wessel said. “We are 
always willing and wanting to be 
supportive to you all as a group 
and to you all as individuals as 
well.”

After Wessel’s presentation, 

CSG President Daniel Greene, 
a Public Policy senior, gave 
a State of Campus address, 
loosely based on the president’s 
annual State of the Union 
address. Greene discussed CSG’s 
financial affairs, partnerships 
with 
off-campus 
resources, 

areas for improvement, key 
campus issues and upcoming 
September policies.

Greene highlighted some of 

his goals for the upcoming year, 

hoping to improve relationships 
with institutions like the Office 
of Financial Aid and MDining, 
and trying to start a process 
of 
online 
registration 
with 

University Health Services and 
Counseling 
and 
Psychiatric 

Services. He also noted the 
creation 
of 
the 
executive 

diversity 
officer 
executive 

position, which he hopes will 
encourage diversity, equity and 
inclusion on a student level.

“I think as of now the DEI 

plan on our campus has been 
too 
administratively 
and 

academically heavy, and if we’re 
really going to get to the point 
where students of any identity 
feel included on our campus and 
safe and comfortable to attend 
the University of Michigan,” 
Greene said. “There’s not a 
better way to get to those 
social 
interactions 
than 
to 

The M Den, the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
official 

merchandise 
retailer, 
will 

be opening its first Detroit 
location on Columbia Street 
in 2019 in partnership with 
Olympia 
Development

The new location occupies 

a stretch of Columbia Street 
that’s part of the Ilitch family’s

long development that will 
feature several shopping and

Detroit will be the seventh 
brick-and-mortar store for The

across Ann Arbor, Novi and

The 
location’s 
collection 

will include regular M Den 
merchandise as well as Detroit-
themed products. With two 
storefronts for both The M Den 
and the Victors Collection by 
The M Den –– a subsidiary that 
features 
higher-end 
apparel 

and accessories –– the store 
will incorporate 4,000 square 
feet of space on the first floor

VP for Equity and Inclusion critiques DEI plan, says University lacks minority inclusion

Robert

and 
chief

officer, 

opened the Minority Serving 
Institutions Disciplinary Hub 
Plenary 
and

at 

the Ross School of Business 
Tuesday afternoon. The event, 
attended by dozens of students 
and faculty, was the conclusion 
of a conference between the 
University of Michigan and 
minority-serving 
institutions 

intended 
to 
cultivate 

relationships 
and 
develop 

strategic goals moving forward.

Sellers began by discussing 

the University’s current five-

Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Inclusion plan. The plan, which 
is currently in its third year, 
aims to recruit more minority 
faculty, graduate students and 
undergraduate students as well 
as cultivate solutions to improve 
retention rates.

While Sellers acknowledged 

the 
plan’s 
successes, 
he 

believes the University and the 
country’s 
academic 
system, 

in 
general, 
is 
still 
deeply 

lacking 
minority 
inclusion.

Mark Schlissel gave me 
writer’s block

P 

resident 
Mark 
Schlissel 
apparently lives in a beautiful 
white 
house 
on 
South 
University and I was going 
to see it. I was going to see it 
because I emailed a professor 
that I needed a building to write about, 
and of the hundreds in Ann Arbor, not a 
single one felt curious enough for a story.
“Break into Mark Schlissel’s house!” he 
wrote.
“Will I be arrested?” I wondered.
“I’m just an Idea Guy!” he replied.
It was an idea, and one I needed, since I 
signed on to write about buildings for The 
Daily’s Statement magazine this semester: 
To turn immobile structures into however 
many 
thousand 
romantically-tainted 
words on a semi-regular basis. When 
I applied, I felt I had a lot to say on the 
subject, and I wanted to force myself to 
write.
The weather was awful the day I fi
 rst 
set out to see the President’s House. I left 
around noon and faced the September mix 
of warm humidity and cold wind that begs 
both for shorts and a fl
 annel, and doesn’t 
blink an eye at the contradiction. I wore 
neither, and downed a Claritin instead, as 
September not only gifts split personality 
weather but also searing and persistent 
allergies.

of the new Little Caesars world 
headquarters.

The Detroit location may 

also host autograph signing 
events 
with 
professional 

athletes, 
some 
of 
whom 

played for the University and 
currently live in the city.

Travis 
Arbogast, 
vice 

president 
of 
development 

at Olympia Development of 
Michigan, said The M Den 
opening will be a fresh addition 
to diversify the stores at the 

Columbia Street shopping 
center.

“As an athletics retailer, 

The M Den will be a fitting 
and welcome addition to 
The District Detroit, the 
only destination in the 
nation where four major 
sports teams play in the 
city’s urban core,” Arbogast 
said. “The apparel and 
merchandise 
shop 
is 

among many storefronts 
planned 
for 
Columbia 

Street that will continue to 
bring retail diversity to our 
steadily-growing district.”

Scott Hirth, co-owner 

and 
president 
of 
The 

M Den, had hopes of 
establishing a Detroit store 
since 2013, especially as 
the 
University 
became 

more involved in the city.

“It was very important 

to us that the next round 
of investment was in the 
city of Detroit,” Hirth said. 
“With the resurgence, we 
wanted The M Den and by 
extension, the University 
of Michigan, to put our 
stamp on Detroit.”

However, the opening of 

The M Den’s new location, 
along with several other retail 
flagship stores in Detroit, raises 
questions 
about 
businesses’ 

and entrepreneurs’ attempts 
to 
“revitalize” 
Detroit. 

Many Detroiters identify the 
economic development seems 
to be pushed in certain areas 
of Detroit while the rest of the 
city is left largely ignored.

LSA junior Alyson Grigsby 

comes from an area of Detroit 
near where the new M Den 
will be built. She said though 
opening a store like The M Den 
may help Detroit financially, it 
is important to question why 
only some parts of Detroit are 
included in city growth.

“On the one hand, sure, 

you can probably bring a little 
bit more revenue to Detroit,” 
Grigsby said. “But Detroit is 
only really being developed in 
certain areas like the Midtown 
and Downtown area, that’s the 
only thing that really irks me. 
Just them selling M Den stuff 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. 
I’m just wondering how come 
groups that do so much in the 
Midtown and Downtown areas 
like Little Caesars Arena don’t 
do anything with other parts of 
Detroit.”

The new M Den location 

LITE R ATI BOOK RE ADING 

The University of Michigan’s 

School 
of 
Art 
& 
Design 

is 
now 
offering 
a 
three-

credit course designed to make 
voting 
“irresistible.” 
Associate 

Profs. Stephanie Rowden and 
Hannah Smotrich teach the new 
course titled Voting is Sexy.

“Do you believe in the power 

of voting? Do you want to be part 
of a super passionate creative 
team working to make voting 
irresistible? We need designers, 
photographers, 
illustrators, 

Instagram 
magicians, 
pop-up 

event 
geniuses, 
videographers, 

animators, social media stars, 
snappy 
writers, 
performers, 

and unabashed political nerds,” 

the course description on the 
Stamps website reads. “Students in 
this team-based class will create a 
high-energy campaign of pop-up 
events, posters, video, social media 
and you name it. You’re going 
to educate, entertain, motivate, 
inspire and enliven your peers 
all the way to the ballot box on 
November 6, 2018.”

Rowden told WWJ News Radio 

the class partners Art & Design 
and Music, Theatre & Dance 
students to create a campaign of 
events and media projects and 
raise awareness for the Nov. 6 
election.

“I was looking at the last mid-

term election — 2014 — and I 

noticed that 43 percent of all 
Michiganders voted but only 14 
percent of U of M students turned 
out to vote in that election,” 
Rowden said. “I looked at that as 
a really important civic challenge 
but also as an artist it’s a really 
interesting creative challenge.”

Today, the course tweeted a 

photo 
of 
the 
students’ 
art 

installation on the walls of an 
Art & Design School building to 
remind University members of the 
day’s special occasion: National 
Voter Registration Day.

Other student organizations on 

campus highlighted opportunities 
for University members to register 
to vote. The U-M Museum of Art, 

in partnership with the Ginsberg 
Center, offers voter registration in 
the UMMA Forum every Tuesday 
until Oct. 9 under UMMA’s VOTE! 
2018 
initiative. 
Registration 

opportunities were also offered 
Tuesday in Haven Hall until 2 p.m.

Central Student Government 

President 
Daniel 
Greene, 
a 

Public Policy senior, reminded 
students 
via 
Twitter 
to 

vote in an effort to win the 
#Big10VotingChallenge, which is 
an initiative created by University 
of Michigan students and faculty 
in which all 14 Big 10 schools will 
compete for the highest student 
voter turnout rates in the 2018 
election.

23 students, 1 prof among 

those jailed

Forty-eight demonstrators, 

including at least 23 University 
students and one professor, 
were arrested yesterday 
during a sit-in protesting U.S. 
aid to Central America in 
Congressman Carl Pursell’s 
Ann Arbor office. 

The arrests came about six 

hours after the protest, which 
attracted about 100 chanting 
demonstrators, began.

THE AFTERNOON’S events 

followed in this order:

*4:55 p.m. - Two Pittsfield 

Township Police officers arrive 
at the scene, read protesters 
the tresspass act which states 
that they’ll be trespassing 
if they don’t leave by 5 p.m. 
Police say they’ll return to the 
scene at 5:05 p.m.;

*5:15 p.m. - Police return to 

the scene of the demonstration 
and tell protesters that they 
will be arrested if they don’t 
leave the office;

*5:20 p.m. - Protesters, some 

carried out of the office by 
police and others walking out, 
are arrested and loaded into 

a Washtenaw County Sheriff 
bus and taken-to the Pittsfield 
Township Police station;

*7:30 p.m. - All of the 

protesters are released on their 
own recognizance. They will 
face a $50 fine and/or up to 
30 days in jail if charges are 
pressed.

Pursell never arrived at the 

protest. Ron Dankert,. owner 
of the building which houses 
Pursell’s office, called the 
police.

“PROTESTING IS the only 

way we’ll stop our government 
from contributing to the 

atrocities in Central America,” 
said Mark Weisbrot, an 
economics teaching assistant 
one of the protesters arrested. 

Yesterday’s protest, was 

organized by members of the 
Latin American Solidarity 
Committee, the Humanity 
Assistance Project for 
Independent Agricultural 
Development in Nicaragua, 
World Hunger Education 
Action Committee, Society 
for a Sane Nuclear Policy, and 
several church groups.

THE PROTESTERS oppose 

the Reagan administration’s 
request for $483 million to 

be appropriated to a Foreign 
Assistance bill. The bill is 
expected to be voted on in 
congress next

week. Pursell’s District 

Coordinator Cynthia Hudgins 
said that she doesn’t know for 
sure how the congressman will 
vote on the bill. But she added 
that judging by the way he has 
voted in the past, it’s safe to 
assume that he will support 
the measure. 

“Pursell has voted to 

support this terror in spite of 
an overwhelming majority of 
letters and phone calls from 
his constituents opposing 
his position on these issues. 

He has heard from his 
constituents, but he, is not 
listening. We therefore have no 
other recourse than to protest,” 
Weisbrot said.

AND THAT is just what the 

students and city residents did. 
They sang peace songs:

“I’m going to lay down my 

war books,

Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside,
I’m going to lay down my war
books,

will help improve programs for 
future graduate students.

“The goal is really for us to 

try to better understand the 
doctoral student experience,” 
Gonzalez said. “We have lots of 
kinds of dry data (gender, race, 
and 
ethnicity 
information) 

about these students, but we 
don’t know, at least on a large 
scale, the details about their 
experience 
and 
how 
that 

changes over time.”

For the 2017 MDES survey, 

all participants were first-year 
graduate students from multiple 
disciplines. 
Researchers 

will follow up with these 
students each year to track 
how their experiences change 
as they approach graduation.
John 
Gonzales, 
director 

of 
Rackham 
Institutional 

Research, explained the study 
allowed researchers to obtain 
information 
from 
students 

beyond what was shared on 
their applications. Topics the 
questions 
explored 
includes 

the diversity of the student 
population, 
students’ 
prior 

experiences, and expectations 
for graduate school and future 
careers.

Because 
many 
graduate 

programs require students to 
complete some research during 
their studies, the MDES team 
was pleasantly surprised to 
learn 86 percent of the first-
year students had experience 
conducting 
some 
form 
of 

research at the undergraduate 
level.

“Often we hear a notion 

of how some students might 
be unprepared (for graduate 
school), so we ask about a 
number of experiences that 
people 
have 
coming 
in,” 

Gonzalez said. “Doing research 

is one of the big experiences 
that are critical in preparing 
students to go to graduate 
school, so we didn’t expect that 
number to be so high.”

Joslin Musick, a Rackham 

student 
studying 
molecular 

and 
integrative 
physiology, 

attributed 
her 
confidence 

coming to graduate school to 
her undergraduate preparation.

“I did feel prepared for 

graduate 
school,” 
Musick 

said. “This could have been a 
combination of my course load 
and my research that I had 
done during my undergraduate 
years.”

The Rackham Institutional 

Research 
team 
also 
asked 

students about their career 
expectations. About 72 percent 
of surveyed students pursuing 
a master’s in social sciences 
reported they wanted to teach 
after earning their degrees. 
Seventy-three 
percent 
of 

these students who chose both 

teaching and research reported 
wanting a tenure track position. 
In comparison, only about 43 
percent of surveyed students 
pursuing 
their 
master’s 
in 

the 
physical 
sciences 
or 

engineering 
reported 
they 

wanted to teach after earning 
their degrees and 46 percent 
wanted a tenure track position.

com/laura_schram/
status/1043072757288845314]

Gonzalez 
explains 

these differences in career 
expectations between students 
of the natural sciences and 
those of the social sciences 
is most likely related to the 
nature of these fields and 
their 
corresponding 
job 

opportunities.

“This is probably a reality of 

the kinds of job markets that 
our students are expected to go 
into and the kind of available 
positions,” Gonzalez said. “So 
if you think about students 

of engineering, for example, 
and the biological and health 
sciences, 
they 
might 
have 

other opportunities in other 
areas like start-up companies 
... where they can go into the 
private sector.”

While 
natural 
sciences 

students have more options 
to go into the private sector, 
Gonzalez explains traditionally 
humanities and social sciences 
students tend to find more jobs 
in education.

“Social science students, the 

traditional pathway for a lot 
of students in these fields is 
tenure track faculty positions 
or government,” Gonzalez said. 
“So I think it kind of aligns 
with their disciplines and the 
expectations and realities of 
those disciplines as well as the 
markets that are out there after 
they graduate.”

Chen hopes he will have the 

same impact on his students as 
his teachers had on him when 

he was a young student with a 
budding interest in chemistry. 
In 2017, Chen even visited his 
high school chemistry teacher 
in Nanjing, China. His former 
teacher turned 100 years old 
last year and Chen gave him a 
mug with a U-M logo as a gift. 
Chen also came from a family 
with an academic background, 
so for him, working for a 
corporation was just not as 
attractive as teaching.

Currently, researchers are 

in the process of collecting 
data for the 2018 MDES survey. 
Respondents will respond to 
similar questions while in their 
second year in graduate school. 
The 
Rackham 
Institutional 

Research team hopes to glean 
new information from these 
students to help future classes. 
They also hope to reach out 
to a new group of first-year 
students 
after 
the 
original 

group of respondents earn their 
degrees.

business school, and I really 
liked that perception of it,” 
Jacobson said. “They really 
talked about social impact 
and 
nonprofit 
sector 
and 

things like that. That’s kind of 
what I wanted to do, and still 
probably want to do.”

After 
spending 
three 

semesters at the Business 
School, though, Jamie felt 
the culture there emphasized 
certain 
careers, 
while 

forgetting about others. 

“I 
felt 
very 
pressured 

to follow the typical Ross 
career path, whether that 
be 
investment 
banking, 

consulting or even marketing, 
and I’d say marketing was the 
least popular of the traditional 
business tracks people tend 
to 
follow,” 
Jacobson 
said. 

“There was always this, ‘Well, 
a lot of people don’t do the 
traditional recruitment and 
we support you through all 
of that.’ But all of the emails 
that I got and consistent 
talk about recruitment was 
all 
consulting, 
finance, 

investment 
banking 
and 

sometimes marketing. It felt 
very constraining.”

Jacobson 
acknowledged 

institutional 
programs 
for 

students 
pursuing 
social 

impact 
exist, 
but 
said 
a 

majority of Business students 
were interested in traditional 
career paths, which is where 
administration 
focused 
its 

efforts on.

“It’s really tough, because 

I think there are plenty of 
people like me who want to 
do social impact, and Ross 
does 
have 
some 
options 

there and some programs 
there,” Jacobson said. “To a 

lot of students who don’t end 
up wanting to do that, my 
perception of that is that they 
feel that all the social impact 
and nonprofit talk is kind of a 
waste of their time, whereas 
on the other side I never really 
intend to use accounting, so 
that kind of felt like not a good 
fit either.”

Business senior Liz Fawley 

also plans to pursue social 
impact work. While Fawley 
admits 
it 
can 
sometimes 

be difficult to not follow a 
traditional 
business 
path, 

she 
believes 
the 
Business 

administration 
is 
trying 

to 
offer 
opportunities 
for 

students like her.

“Our dean and associate 

dean are very pro-positive 
business and talk a lot about 
developing 
future 
business 

leaders to create a more 
positive future,” she said. 
“They really are passionate 
about this –– I really do 
think that it’s not just all talk. 
They’ve spent a lot of money 
on all the programs.”

According 
to 
Norman 

Bishara, associate dean for 
undergraduate 
and 
early 

career 
programs 
at 
the 

Business School, the school 
has over 100 organizations 
dedicated to social impact 
and 
nonprofit 
work. 
One 

such 
organization 
Fawley 

is involved in, Net Impact, 
combines students from all 
majors to create positive social 
and environmental change. 
Finding this niche within the 
Business School played a key 
role in her decision to continue 
with her field of study, Fawley 
said.

“One time this summer, I 

had to teach a Ross student 
what a union is,” said Fawley. 
“In Net Impact, everyone is 
on the same page. You can 

find your community within 
Ross, and that is one reason 
I’ve been able to stay level-
headed throughout the entire 
process.”

Bishara 
stresses 
while 

the Business School values 
positive 
business, 
the 

administration does not wish 
to force students into one 
career path or another.

“We 
are 
the 
positive 

business 
school 
and 
have 

been for a while now. More 
than other schools around the 
world, we really care about 
business’ impact on society,” 
Bishara said. “One thing I 
don’t really love hearing is, 
‘Ross wants this.’ There is no 
Ross desire for students, other 
than we want our students to 
be engaged, have good lives, be 
good citizens, be good leaders, 
and it’s not in a certain field or 
another. That’s not what we’re 
designing at all. Yeah, there 
are students who want to go 
in certain directions, and we 
want to support that, so we do 
that for any student who wants 
to go into any role. I think 
there’s tons of opportunities, 
and so if people aren’t finding 
them, that’s a failure in some 
way.”

Jacobson said while the 

two sides of the Business 
School each had strengths, 
but seemed to compete with 
each other rather than work in 
tandem.

“Honestly, 
I 
think 
that 

they’re in a very strange 
crux right now, where they 
have a lot of kids and a lot of 
alumni and just a lot of people 
expecting them to continue 
sending all these people into 
Wall Street and to continue 
developing really, really good 
business students for that, but 
then they also have this other 
goal of being a social impact 

business 
school,” 
Jacobson 

said. “And I think right now 
bridging the two identities of 
the business school, as being 
this 
elite 
institution 
that 

connects really big firms with 
exceptional, well-performing, 
passionate students, there’s 
that side of it, but there’s 
also the side of trying to 
develop a social impact focus 
curriculum, a social impact 
focused 
recruiting 
process 

and I think it’s really difficult 
for those two to connect.”

Business senior Mohammad 

Shaikh 
hoped 
to 
pursue 

positive 
business 
in 
his 

studies, but found the school’s 
curriculum did not live up to 
its branding of being a positive 
business school.

“I think that Ross brands 

itself as a business school that 
cares about positive business, 
positive business being defined 
as business working to solve 
society’s biggest problems,” 
Shaikh said. “If you look at 
their website, what they’re 
about, that’s how they brand 
themselves. What it looks like 
right now, it seems like they 
don’t really care about it. They 
sort of just weave it into their 
curriculum without making it 
central. It seems like the core 
business classes that you take 
at any business school are 100 
percent the central component 
and 
then 
impact 
positive 

business initiatives are kind of 
wrapped around very subtly.”

However, Shaikh believes 

Business School Dean Scott 
DeRue may change the culture 
in a few years.

“Anytime 
(DeRue) 
goes 

on anything, he talks about 
(positive business),” Shaikh 
said. “I do think that they’re 
working to make that a bigger 
part of their vision, because 
he goes on different trips, 

and this is his thing. I think 
that in future years, because 
he just started two years ago 
I believe, I think in coming 
years he’s going to hopefully 
carry it out.”

Jacobson 
thinks 
making 

it 
easier 
for 
students 
to 

double major would allow 
students 
pursuing 
social 

impact 
adequate 
space 
in 

their schedule to take the 
classes or electives they need 
to supplement their business 
degree.

“I felt like they’re telling me 

to be social impact focused, 
but then I’m focused mostly 
on getting good grades for 
recruiting, recruiting for a 
bunch of firms, to be perfectly 
honest, their main goal was 
not social impact,” Jacobson 
said. “As someone who was 
trying to do a dual degree, 
I didn’t have room in my 
schedule at all to take an easy 
class to inflate my grades.”

Shaikh believes the solution 

lies with a realignment of 
what society should value.

“On a larger scale, the 

smartest people in my class 
don’t go into the impact-
oriented 
careers 
because 

they’re not valued by society,” 
Shaikh said. “What’s valued by 
society? The positions that, in 
my opinion, contribute to the 
problem. That’s the problem. 
There should be an incentive 
structure that’s built up, such 
that if I’m someone who wants 
to go into a career that helps 
others, and I’m very smart and 
qualified, I should have a very 
clear avenue to that path. And 
in my opinion, even if you’re 
not 
someone 
who’s 
super 

passionate about impact, I 
think that the world demands 
that there’s more talented 
people in these spaces that are 
helping others.”

work with the structure of student 
organizations.”

Greene elaborated on the student 

liaison program, which he and 
CSG Vice President Isabel Baer, an 
LSA junior, created. The program 
allows student organizations to 
communicate and meet with each 
other through a CSG forum. He said 
the goal of the program is to allow 
for a more collaborative culture on 
campus.

“The idea is to really build 

that 
cross-student 
organization 

collaboration, but really tap into the 
ownership of our fellow Wolverines 
and into our campus community,” 
Greene said. “Because to me, it’s 
planting the seeds for the long-term 
investment that’s going to allow for 
the cultural and social shift on our 
campus.”

The meeting continued with 

community 
concerns, 
where 

two members of the University 
community 
talked 
about 
their 

boycott of Israel, relating it to Prof. 
Cheney-Lippold’s refusal to write a 
recommendation letter for a student 
to study abroad in Israel. After, CSG 
members nominated for certain 
executive positions were confirmed.

The representatives ended the 

meeting 
by 
discussing 
various 

resolutions, including one aiming to 
amend elected representatives’ office 
hours to make them more efficient 
and useful. LSA sophomore Benjamin 
Gerstein, an LSA representative and 
chair of resolutions, emphasized 
the importance of office hours and 
listening to community concerns.

“A lot of what we talk about and 

a lot of our goals on CSG is to be the 
mass representative of our schools, 
and office hours provides you the 
opportunity to hear perspectives 
other than our own on what is going 
on in our communities,” Gerstein 
said.

campus environment. Sellers 
called for better cooperation 
between 
institutions 
within 

the University and more focus 
on developing the skills of 
minority faculty and students 
instead of just recruiting them.

“We, 
like 
many 
other 

predominantly 
white 

institutions that have had these 
relationships, have tended to 
think about them in a model that 
is more consistent with what 
happened in terms of the negro 
leagues,” Sellers said. “When 
we 
integrated 
baseball, 
we 

didn’t fully integrate baseball … 
what we said was we will let the 
talent play everywhere, but not 
the management. … We have to 
change that paradigm.”

Edmund 
Graham, 
the 

Minority Serving Institutions 
coordinator at Rackham, hosted 
a 
panel 
following 
Sellers’ 

speech 
that 
featured 
Dina 

Stroud, the executive director 

of the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master’s-
to-PhD 
Bridge 
Program. 

The program helps Vanderbilt 
University graduate students, 
specifically 
underrepresented 

and 
minority 
students, 

complete their master’s degrees 
and place them in a position to 
later acquire a Ph.D.

Stroud highlighted some of 

the measures the program has 
taken to better suit minority 
needs, including the need to 
tailor the graduate program 
to the students’ needs and 
career ambitions. Stroud also 
encouraged students to take 
part in committees pertaining 
to minority students and share 
their thoughts on how the 
programs can better suit their 
needs. 
Providing 
consistent 

mentorship and mental health 
services was also of utmost 
focus. Despite this, Stroud said 
the program’s efforts are met 
with massive obstacles. Stroud 
noted lack of funding from 
institutions as a key issue, in 
addition to problems with the 
application 
and 
acceptance 

process. 

“We have made the most 

progress in terms of holistic 
admissions… but we are still 
pushing back against GREs and 
numbers,” she said. “And I feel 
like we even took a bigger step 
backwards, actually, this last 
year when we … had no fee for 

our graduate application, and 
now we have a fee … It’s a push 
all the time.”

Stroud 
also 
pointed 
to 

systemic racism as a persistent 
issue.

“You get frustrated at times 

opening doors to a place … that’s 
still not welcoming all the time, 
and you have to tell them, ‘This 
is the systemic racism that you 

are going to have to encounter,” 
she said. “Are you going to get 
treated differently because you 
are at Fisk? Yes.”

The 
panel 
also 
featured 

Brian Beckford, a presidential 
postdoctoral 
fellow 
at 
the 

University 
who 
served 
as 

the Bridge Program project 
manager in the Department 
of Education and Diversity for 
the American Physical Society 
in College Park, Maryland. 
The Bridge Program focuses 
on 
increasing 
the 
number 

of physics Ph.Ds awarded to 
underrepresented 
minority 

students at Maryland.

Beckford 
stressed 
the 

importance 
of 
supporting 

diversity inclusion programs 
until 
academia 
is 
more 

inclusive 
of 
minority 
and 

underrepresented communities.

“These efforts are going to 

be continued, in my opinion, 
to be overlooked at times, to 
be unrewarded, to be under 
volunteered … and it’s going to 
fall on a specific group most 
of the time to continue these 
efforts,” he said. “Until there 

is a larger participation and 
until access to participating in 
academy is changed, I think you 
have to have these programs in 
place.”

Beckford called for the need 

to focus on sustaining these 
programs 
through 
funding 

and 
participation. 
Beckford 

specifically 
highlighted 
the 

importance of support from 
tenured 
professors 
when 

creating one of these programs.

“You 
have 
to 
(have) 
20 

percent at minimum tenured 
faculty that are willing to be 
involved,” he said. “If you are 
smaller than that, I think you 
are starting with one leg cut off. 
It’s just going to be new junior 
faculty. … It’s really hard to get 
going.”

Naomi 
Wilson, 
a 
Ph.D 

candidate at the University and 
President of Rackham student 
government, asked the panel 
how graduate students can play 
a role outside of recruitment 
in assisting minority graduate 
students.

Stroud 
responded 
by 

encouraging 
a 
student 

mentorship 
program 
for 

minority and underrepresented 
students 
and 
increasing 

graduate student involvement 
through 
activities 
and 

workshops meant to educate 
other students.

“You can do professional 

development 
type 
of 

presentations, 
you 
can 
put 

abstracts in some places to 
do workshops, or you can be 
designing some things … really 
start brainstorming as to what 
we want to see and how you can 
make that happen, and faculty 
listening to them when they tell 
you what they want to see and 
how you can help them make 
that happen,” she stated.

Beckford 
responded 
by 

encouraging graduate student 
involvement in the admissions 
process, and requesting review 
of 
the 
graduate 
program’s 

professional development.

“In part of your annual 

review… request to have a 
large component where there 
is a professional development 
component or something that is 
discussed,” he said.

comes as the University has 
attempted to build its presence 
through conferences and years 
of partnership initiatives in 
Detroit, where the school was 

originally founded in 1817. Some 
of the University’s programs, 
such as Semester in Detroit, 
have also been problematic. 
Companies like General Motors 
and Quicken Loans have also 
made efforts to increase their 
presence in the city.

Grigsby asserts problems such 

as the city’s access to education 

are left largely unaddressed 
while business development like 
Columbia Street increases. She 
believes it is cause of concern 
for native Detroiters, who want 
to see their city grow and want 
to make sure Detroiters are not 
left behind.

“Along with the people living 

in Detroit, I don’t say there’s a 

revitalization because they’re 
only really developing some 
parts of the city,” Grigsby said. 
“In some parts of the city, people 
are having their water shut off 
because they can’t afford water, 
or they can’t afford to live where 
they are or they can’t afford to 
get the jobs or opportunities 
they need to succeed. There are 

things like that where they’re 
not trying to improve public 
services but instead trying to 
improve the parts of Detroit 
that they want to make look 
pretty. Midtown and Downtown 
are at least fine in that aspect, 
people are coming to games and 
promote the city. But you have 
to make sure the people who 

live there are taken care of first 
in my opinion.”

Grigsby 
suggested 
hiring 

workers from Detroit for the 
new stores in the development.

“You could try and get local 

people involved,” Grigsby said. 
“If they hire Detroiters, that 
could at least make a better 
impact on the city.”

T

he day I told my mom that 
I was gay, she cried. 
The day I told my mom 
that I was gay, she cried. 
She wept not because of who 
I was, but because of what I was 
losing.
“Life is hard enough as it is, 
and I want things to be as easy 
as they can be for you.” she said. 
“I just don’t want you to lose that 
innocence any earlier than you 
have to.”
I 
nodded 
half-heartedly, 
trying to fully understand what 
she had meant. After seeing my 
younger sister diagnosed with 
cancer at the age of four, my 
mother had already witnessed 
first-hand how fragile the world 
that she had spent years molding 
for us can be. Thus, she did all that 
she could to keep that delicate 
refuge intact.
But at the age of 15, my 
innocence was stolen. It was a 
gradual exhaustion— a creeping 
yet steady depletion that grew 
stronger as the foundation below 
me began to cave. Each day, as 
I began to piece together the 
origins of that pervasive “off” 
feeling, I would watch as the 
once-childlike landscape of the 
world I had rested upon for so 
long became soiled.
My mother was right. Coming 
to terms with my sexuality also 
meant I could no longer view 
life through the narrowed lens 
carefully crafted for me — for 
a greater awareness of myself 
meant a fuller understanding of 
the world around me. Most of 
these things were innocuous — 
things most people don’t even 
think of. I couldn’t experience the 
showy, juvenile thrill of holding 
someone’s hand as I exited 
the school doors (an essential 
validation for any true high school 
relationship). Rather, I sat in a 
classroom as my basic rights and 
privileges were assigned at the 
class “debate of the day.” I didn’t 
get to spend my time ruminating 
over how to craft the perfectly-
extravagant “promposal” (one 
that looked like it had come 
straight from the dashboard of a 
teenage girl’s Pinterest). Rather, 
I had to worry if my school 
principal would permit me to 
attend prom with my date at all.
As a 15-year-old, I had to 
juggle the responsibilities that 
most people my age dealt with. 

High school in general is a 
confusing time for everyone. Yet, 
as someone who was aware of 
my identity and the additional 
questions that came along with 
it, I found myself having to also 
navigate another world without 
any map on which to rely.
While 
the 
realization 
of 
this lone perspective became 
increasingly evident in the years 
I spent discovering my own 
identity, it took one unanticipated 
development 
that 
occurred 
hundreds of miles away from me 
to truly grasp this reality.
It was the last week of 
April, and the issue of same-
sex marriage had reached the 
Supreme Court for the second 
time in three years (the first being 
United States v. Windsor, which 
invalidated the federal ban on 
such relationships). I anxiously 
awaited as the audio of the oral 
argument was released. It was a 
school night, and I had an exam 
in my statistics class the following 
morning. While I should have 
been spending my night mulling 
over confidence intervals, or even 
defiantly ignoring my academic 
responsibilities in the name of 
senior year, I instead found myself 
fixated on the words, the questions, 
the silence of these nine seemingly 
God-like figures who held the fate 
of me and millions of others in 
their hands. Now 16 years old, I 
was no constitutional scholar. The 
front page of the New York Times 
the next morning was sure to offer 
a sufficient prediction of what the 
outcome would be. Yet I needed 
to hear every word of the case, the 
way in which each meticulously 
crafted question was delivered. I 
yearned for some sense of control 
of this potentially life-changing 
decision.
Every now and then, as I sat in 
the confines of my room the soft, 
yet stern, delivery of the counsel’s 
voice would be interrupted by 
a piercing ring from my phone. 
While I was listening attentively 
to the case presented, as if I were 
there in the chambers myself, 
text messages from friends and 
classmates would appear on my 
screen.
“Do you think we need to 
remember 
the 
Central 
Limit 
Theorem?”, “Coffee before school 
tomorrow?” or the absolutely 
original “I’m done studying! It’s 
not like colleges are gonna take 

back my acceptance anyway.” Each 
message served as a reminder of 
the vastly different realities we 
lived in.
Two months later, the degree 
to which these two distinct worlds 
had diverged fully settled. It was 
the day after my high school 
graduation. The weather was 
perfect, and my friends were 
headed to the beach to celebrate the 
commencement of our last summer 
before college. What should have 
been a morning of excitement 
over the accomplishment of one 
of life’s greatest milestones was 
instead filled with dread. While no 
concrete schedule was disclosed, 
the decision on the Supreme Court’s 
case on same-sex marriage seemed 
poised to be released that morning. 
Wrapped in my covers, unable to 
remove myself from the comfort 
and safety of my bed, I frantically 
opened Twitter, wincing as each 
new tweet appeared on my feed. To 
my surprise, rather than finding an 
influx of messages on the incoming 
momentous decision, I instead 
found myself navigating through 
tweets that were simply “normal.” 
As my stomach knotted in fear and 
anticipation, my timeline filled 
with “we finally did it #Sen15rs” 
posts and retweeted images of cats. 
But 
eventually, 
those 
two 
worlds froze. There, alone on my 
bed, my life had transformed at 
the hands of five people. Now, I 
could one day legally marry the 
person whom I loved. In my room, 
an air of change became palpable. 
However, once I stepped out, that 
poignant feeling began to melt 
away. Outside, life proceeded in 
a seemingly unchanged manner. 
Most people were not even aware 
that the decision took place. In that 
moment, the reality of my position 
truly hit me.
But this time, I didn’t allow 
myself to be a victim to my situation. 
While I may have had to worry 
about things most others did not, it 
was through being gay I first learned 
my strength. It has pushed me to 
find the best qualities in myself and 
others. Though I thought at 15 years 
old I had figured out my life’s hardest 
decision and knew all I needed to 
know about myself, here I am, five 
years later, still cautious of many

Boycott Israel? Why not boycott China and Western Europe?
E

arly last week, Prof. Cheney-
Lippold of the American 
Culture department sent an 
email to student Abigail Ingber letting 
Ingber know that for political reasons he 
did not feel comfortable writing Ingber 
a letter of recommendation to study 
abroad in Israel. Cheney-Lippold cited 
an “academic boycott against Israel in 
support of Palestinians living in Palestine” 
as his reason for “rescinding” the letter.
 This decision has been nothing but 
controversial among students and the 
broader University community. Cheney-
Lippold’s decision opens up a wide 
variety of questions about Israel, ethical 
responsibility and anti-Semitism. At a 
fundamental level, the refusal to write 
the letter comes from an admirable place, 
as Cheney-Lippold acted upon his beliefs. 
For Cheney-Lippold, studying abroad 
and traveling to Israel upholds and reifies 
a system that oppresses Palestinians 
living in Palestine. The most common 
and intuitive reaction among supporters 
of Israel is to bring these beliefs about 
the unethicality of the state of Israel into 
question, but there is a larger and more 
important theoretical question at hand 
about the nature of American discourse 
on Israel.
For the sake of argumentation, let’s 
assume the views of Cheney-Lippold and 
other boycotters on the state of Israel are 
true. The official Boycott Divest Sanctions 
movement website says study abroad 
programs are a form of “propaganda 
… 
designed 
to 
give 
international 
students a ‘positive experience’ of Israel, 
whitewashing its occupation and denial 
of Palestinian rights.” The BDS website 
also clearly outlines United Nations 
definitions of human rights violations 
ast the main standards for academically 
boycotting Israel. I would be shocked if 
any study abroad program was not 
designed to give students a “positive 
experience” of the country. Let’s also 
assume these are not just acceptable 
standards for denying to write a letter 
of recommendation but actually ethical 
guidelines. 
From this, should a professor in 
France deny a student’s request to study 
at the University of Michigan because 
the U.N. deemed Detroit water shutoffs 

to be a human rights violation? Should 
the French professor deny the request to 
study here because the professor believes 
the United States is founded upon a 
history of slavery and genocide? Isn’t 
one’s intuition to point out there are many 
people in the U.S. who have committed 
their lives to fighting against the many 
problems in our country? To say any visit 
to America necessarily supports these 
violent histories is not only reductive of 
American history but silences people in 
the U.S. who are working against these 
forces of domination.
Maybe you aren’t sold on the 
example of the French professor 
and the student who wants to 
study at the University. Currently 
in China, nearly a million people 
of the Uighur ethnic minority are 
being unlawfully detained and 
sent to “brainwashing” internment 
camps. The Chinese government 
refuses to give explanations for 
these actions and often denies 
the accounts of Uighurs who 
have escaped or been released 
from 
the 
internment 
camps. 
China is running an intentional 
campaign to arrest and eradicate 
an ethnic minority yet no one in 
the United States is talking about 
it or protesting against it. The 
Chinese government has also 
been criticized for its rampant 
use of censorship and general 
free speech suppression. Would 
Cheney-Lippold deny a student’s 
request to study in China? I doubt 
it. Furthermore, I would be hard-
pressed to learn of a country that 
does not have a history soaked in 
blood. England, Germany, France 
and Spain, the most common 
destinations for study abroad 
have 
histories 
of 
colonialism 
and/or genocide that have deep 
lasting negative effects on the 
world today. Why don’t we hear 
professors reject other nations 
on the basis of ethical premises? 
What is the theoretical threshold 
that makes a country so unethical 
that a professor shouldn’t support 
a student studying there?
I would imagine a supporter 

of the boycott would respond 
to this point by highlighting 
Israel-Palestine is an undeniably 
more vibrant issue in American 
political discourse than human 
rights violations in China or even 
the ongoing violence caused by 
western Europe’s colonial history. 
In a non-academic context, I think 
this 
argument 
is 
compelling: 
There are a limited number of 
political issues worldwide of which 
someone can keep track and at 
some level political prioritization 
is arbitrary and/or dictated by 
media. However, I don’t think 
Cheney-Lippold, an academic in 
the humanities, should be able to 
access this argument. Academics 
and 
humanitarians 
are 
the 
people who should be thinking 
through 
political 
orientations 
on 
larger, 
more 
theoretically 
consistent levels. If there is anyone 
who should theorize about the 
ethicality of political orientations 
and the ways that media narratives 
shape our understanding of those 
issues, it is academics like Cheney-
Lippold.
My contempt for Cheney-
Lippold’s decision does not stem 
from Cheney-Lippold’s political 
views on Israel or the fact that 
he was willing to act. In fact, I 
respect Cheney-Lippold for boldly 
standing up for what he believes. 
What frustrates me is Cheney-
Lippold did not place his decision 
within a larger framework for 
understanding which countries 
have acceptable enough politics 
and which ones do not. For 
Cheney-Lippold 
and 
fellow 
boycotters, I request a thorough 
explanation 
of 
what 
makes 
a 
country 
worthy 
of 
academic 
boycotting and which countries 
do or do not meet those standards, 
because without an explanation, I 
can’t help but wonder if there is a 
double standard for Israel.

Sick of victim shaming? Yeah, #MeToo
I

t’s 
been 
almost 
a 
year since the fateful 
Harvey Weinstein story 
broke, 
upending 
Hollywood 
and most of the world. It 
seems like every day people 
are coming forward with their 
own tales of sexual harassment. 
Obviously not every predator 
has been dealt with, not every 
assault has been exposed and 
not every victim has come 
forth, but we are beginning 
to 
recognize 
this 
problem 
and deal with it accordingly. 
With every #MeToo, we seem 
to rid ourselves of another 
sexual predator infesting our 
movies, offices and even our 
government. This cleansing of 
the legislative branch, as well as 
many other areas of our society, 
is an encouraging prospect. 
After this era of silence, we now 
can rid society of this plague 
once and for all. Right?
Wrong. 
Just 
when 
we 
thought 
we 
wouldn’t 
have 
to put up with this anymore, 
prospective 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh done 
gets 
#MeToo’d. 
Christine 
Blasey 
Ford, 
a 
Northern 
California a psychologist and 
professor of statistics at Palo 
Alto University, recently came 
forward claiming Kavanaugh 
attempted to rape her at a party 
in high school. Kavanaugh 
claims it never happened and 
that he doesn’t even remember 
the incident detailed, but Ford 
remains strong in her story. 
She and the Democrats want 
an FBI investigation to provide 
credibility to her story, but 
Republicans are resisting. 
Another allegation released 
in a recent article from The 
New Yorker reveals Deborah 
Ramirez, a Yale classmate of 
Kavanaugh’s, has recently come 
forth with a sexual harassment 
claim 
from 
an 
experience 
she had while at college. This 
claim is extremely new and 
investigations still must be 
made, but many have backed 
up her story and Ramirez 
is also asking for a full FBI 
investigation. She decided to go 
public only because she didn’t 
want others to do it for her.
“I didn’t want any of this,” 
Ramirez said to The New 
Yorker. “But now I have to 
speak.” She hoped her story 
would add credibility to Ford’s 
claims as well.
In 
the 
race 
to 
get 
a 
conservative Supreme Court 
justice sworn in before the 
possible turnover during the 
midterm elections, Kavanaugh 
is a key player in the Republican 
agenda, 
to 
which 
these 
allegations pose a monumental 
threat. Some are even implying 
this is all just a political ploy 
created by Democrats to get rid 
of a possible conservative judge.
The main question these 
Republicans 
are 
asking 
is 

why now? Why did Ford, the 
first 
allegation, 
wait 
until 
Kavanaugh was about to be 
confirmed into the Supreme 
Court to come forward with 
her allegations (though there 
is proof that she told Rep. 
Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and Sen. 
Dianne 
Feinstein, 
D-Calif., 
about the issue in July). Even 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
tweeted “I have no doubt that, 
if the attack on Dr. Ford was as 
bad as she says, charges would 
have been immediately filed 
with local Law Enforcement 
Authorities by either her or her 
loving parents. I ask that she 
bring those filings forward so 
that we can learn date, time, 
and place!”
Here’s the thing: There’s 
so much complexity in when 

and why victims come forward. 
After the beginning of the 
#MeToo movement and women 
from all different careers and 
income levels were exposing 
their abusers, it seemed like the 
taboos that came with this issue 
were beginning to dissolve. 
But there are still so many 
reasons women do not step 
forward about sexual assault, 
or why they do it long after the 
assault. In response to Trump’s 
tweet, 
many 
are 
tweeting 
#WhyIDidntReport, detailing 
their own experiences with 
sexual assault and why they 
were not able to come forward 
at the time, writing they were 
too young to be taken seriously, 
it was a friend or husband, it 
was a police officer or no one 
would believe them. This isn’t 
just an issue with Ford — it’s an 
issue for thousands of women 
all over the world.
While 
talking 
to 
The 
Washington 
Post, 
Ford 
personally grappled with what 
coming forward publicly would 
mean for her and her family, a 
common issue for many victims, 
especially if their predator is 
someone powerful or well-
known. Eventually, through a 
series of events that led to her 
name being exposed against 
her will, Ford decided it was 
her duty as a citizen to reveal 
this disturbing story about a 
possible Supreme Court justice. 
Ramirez 
detailed 
similar 
feelings in her interviews.
According to the Maryland 
Coalition 
Against 
Sexual 

Assault, victims often don’t 
report sexual assault incidences 
for a number of reasons: they 
are afraid of repercussions 
from the predator, think the 
police won’t do anything, don’t 
want their family and friends 
to find out, are afraid to be 
attacked as liars, among many 
other reasons. Sexual assault is 
a complicated issue, so coming 
forward about it is naturally 
just as, if not more, complicated.
For those who do decide 
to come forward, the fear 
and doubt don’t end there. 
Often times these victims are 
shamed and their experiences 
are minimalized by outsiders. 
Especially if the perpetrator 
is a popular, well-liked figure, 
they are even more likely to 
receive hate and discrimination 
because of their experiences.
Like many victims, Ford 
suffered 
extreme 
trauma 
because of this event. She has 
experienced long-term anxiety 
and 
post-traumatic 
stress 
disorder symptoms from this 
event, as many other survivors 
face; that is, coming forward 
can be practically impossible 
because of all the painful 
memories it drags up. According 
to The Washington Post, Ford 
has been unable to form healthy 
relationships with men, and 
her friend, Jim Gensheimer, 
revealed she resisted buying a 
house without a second exit in 
the master bedroom. However, 
despite her struggles, she has 
given other women courage 
to stand up against predators 
and finally come forth about 
their experiences, as it did with 
Ramirez.
Ford wasn’t lucky enough to 
have her complete say in how and 
when her story was revealed. 
Though she eventually decided 
coming forward was crucial 
in preserving the integrity of 
our government, her life and 
the lives of her family will 
forever be changed because of 
these events. How, when and 
if she and any other victims 
of sexual assault reveal their 
stories should always be their 
choice. 
Throughout 
these 
trials, we see much debate 
about 
whether 
Ford 
and 
Ramirez’s claims are real and 
why they are emerging now; 
yet, rarely are these women 
being granted the respect they 
deserve for putting themselves 
on the line to stand up against 
corruption in the government. 
We have gained incredible 
ground over the past year 
in 
listening 
to 
women’s 
stories and respecting their 
experiences 
— 
Ford 
and 
Ramirez should be treated 
no differently. Victims are 
not always able to come forth 
about their abuses. But when

The album cover that graces 

the front of The Cat Breathes the 
Fresh Water is a barely discernible 
cacophony of red. “The Cat,” it 
declares in messy scrawl in the 
upper left-hand corner, before 
getting cut off by what can only be 
described as a vague approximation 
of a human face. 
On 
either 
side, 

two stars hang at a 
lopsided angle and a 
miniature cat hides 
in the empty circle 
of the left eye. Its 
whiskers are askew; 
its solemn eyes are 
pinpricks.

The album cover is akin to 

almost every single bored doodle 
you would see if you picked up any 
high schooler’s Algebra notebook 
and flipped through the pages. It 
is totally, completely and utterly 
offhand, yet its roughness beguiles 
the casual observer rather than 
repels. After all — especially in 
music — so rarely are you allowed 
to see art displayed like this: 
Stripped down to its essence, the 
seemingly meaningless byproduct 
of an errant hand and a wandering 
mind. The Cat’s convoluted lines 
call to you. Intrigued, you can only 
wonder who the cat in question is, 
how they can even breathe water 
in the first place and hit play on the 
first song. It is titled “The Cat Is 
Back,” and it announces its return 
with a buoyant: 

“Yo! Homeslice G.”
The Cat Breathes the Fresh Water 

is the third album to come out of 
The Cat, a musical duo consisting 
of former Daily Arts writer and 
Ford senior Will Stewart and 
Dylan Trupiano, a senior at George 
Washington University. The album 

was released on Sept. 14, yet it 
seems that the origin of the album 
itself, its essence, was conceived 
during a sleepover between the 
two boys many years prior. A night 
that started with rudimentary 
piano banging and what can only 
be imagined as a pretty impressive 
falsetto 
courtesy 
of 
Stewart 

himself, and ended with the hazy 
emergence of what would later 
become The Cat.

The Cat Breathes 

the 
Fresh 
Water 

grows 
from 
this 

initial 
youthful 

exuberance. 
It’s 

apparent 
from 

those 
very 
first 

few lines of “The 
Cat 
Is 
Back.” 

“Yo! 
Homeslice 

G,” a disembodied voice calls, 
and is immediately answered by 
makeshift beatboxing, which then 
falls into a beat that punctuates the 
vocals with an intensity that belies 
the actual words themselves. “The 
cat is back, and he’s ready to rap” is 
repeated, climbing pitch each time 
until it reaches a fervor that makes 
your eyes water.

Musical experimentation for 

musical experimentation’s sake, 
The Cat finds a way to layer and 
stitch together a variety of sounds, 
textures and genres in the span 
of 35 minutes. The rolling beat 
that drives “Give This Cat A Slap” 
forward 
is 
interspersed 
with 

ad-libs as abrupt and absurd as 
Playboi Carti’s. The rage-infused 
electronic/rap hybrid of “Summer 
Sweat Mix” is a reminder (albeit 
a more subtle reminder) of Death 
Grips’s 
particular 
brand 
of 

industrial hip-hop fusion. “Red 
Flannel”’s raspy guitar hum is 
every Alex G song on steroids.

The album isn’t cohesive; it 

isn’t meant to be, yet, even so, the 
soft children’s choir sequence 

sampled at the end of the “The 
Cat Is Back” bleeds into the first 
few seconds of “Give This Cat A 
Slap,” and the acoustic trepidation 
of “Red Flannel” is picked back up 
again during “King of Downriver” 
and “Holding Me Back.” It holds 
together all the same. Maybe it’s 
because of the history behind The 
Cat, years of friendship between 
band partners acting like a glue 
of sorts, or maybe it’s because 
of the album’s own constant 
unpredictability. You genuinely 
don’t know what to expect from 
song to song on The Cat Breathes 
the Fresh Water, so you come to 
expect it all.

Above everything else, The 

Cat has created something that 
is genuinely fun to listen to. The 
album’s individual components 
— the mournful, autotuned tirade 
against a past lover in “That’s Not 
My Phone Number” (“How did 
you get this phone number, baby 
/ That’s not my phone number,” 
the narrator croons, and the 
audience cries with him), the 
harmonious dance between deep 
electric guitar riffs and what 
could either be Bauhaus-esque 
electronica or a really out of tune 
piccolo towards the end of “Don’t 
Burn My Kids Shorts” — are 
each one more creative than the 
last. You can’t help but smile at 
the dramatically pitched vocals, 
at the unceremonious changes 
in rhythm, at every weird and 
wonderful aspect.

The Cat stretches their bona fide 

sincerity and musical expertise 
into grotesque shapes on The Cat 
Breathes the Fresh Water. What 
we know as music is warped into 
absurdity; the resulting carnival 
funhouse mirror maze reflects 
back a reality that is both familiar 
and not, colorful and vibrant in 
a way that compels you to just sit 
down and just soak it all in.

Wednesday, September 26, 2018 — 5A

This morning saw the release 

of the third and final trailer for 
the upcoming J.K. Rowling film 
“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes 
of Grindelwald,” and with it the 
reminder that, oh right, there’s 
a “Harry Potter” prequel series 
going on right now.

Beginning 
in 
2016 
with 

“Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
Find Them,” J.K. Rowling, along 
with director David Yates, began 
telling what they claim will be a 
five-part story exploring the life 
of Newt Scamander and a young 
Albus 
Dumbledore, 
the 
fight 

against archvillain Grindelwald 
and 
a 
great 
wizarding 
war 

that appears to bear a striking 
resemblance to another wizarding 
war we witnessed not that long ago.

Before this series not-so-subtly 

revealed itself as a full-blown Harry 
Potter prequel, it was ostensibly 
supposed to follow the adventures 
of Newt as he traveled around 
the world collecting creatures to 
study for the eponymous book for 
which the first film was named. 
That seems to have largely fallen 
by the wayside in favor of the story 
surrounding 
Dumbledore 
and 

Grindelwald, arguably one of the 
larger portions of backstory given 
to us in the original Potter text. 
While possibly an interesting story 
in its own right, how can it ever 
compare against the backdrop of 
the boy wizard saga that taught a 
generation to love reading?

For many creators, prequels 

appear like a safe way to move 
forward with more of a beloved 
story without actually having to do 
so. It’s a way to give you more Star 
Wars without having to write past 
the natural ending, and a way to 
give the world more Harry Potter 
without ruining Harry’s story. 
Prequels, at first glance, seem like 
a good bet but they inevitably hurt 
a franchise more than they help it. 

Harry Potter, in particular, feels 
like a franchise that should be 
allowed to die while it’s still alive. 
For a time, J.K. Rowling herself 
seemed content to let Harry lie 
low and relax, but in recent years, 
she has become far more willing to 
go back to the proverbial well and 
(at the risk of mixing metaphors) 
milk the cow for all its worth. 
Like Tolkien and Lucas before her, 

Rowling simply can’t resist the pull 
that her creations have over herself 
and over the wallets of the world. 
First came “Harry Potter and the 
Cursed Child,” a play that received 
rave reviews for the production 
but came under intense scrutiny 
by fans for its confusing narrative, 
shock value twists and seeming 
disregard 
for 
the 
previously 

established canon.

This 
newest 
trailer 
for 

“Grindelwald” leans even more 
heavily into previously established 
Potter 
lore, 
name-dropping 

Voldemort’s snake Nagini, seen 
here as a young woman one 
presumes will eventually become 
trapped in the form of a snake in a 
twist straight out of an Animorphs 
book. This development is another 
classic example of the plight 
that prequel stories often have 
to contend with. In the original 
series, Nagini was merely a creepy 
pet of a creepy villain. Now, she’s 
a seemingly central character, 

hinting that Voldemort himself 
will eventually appear. How are 
we supposed to be afraid of Johnny 
Depp’s Grindelwald when we 
know that the real ultimate evil, 
the one who will one day murder 
Grindelwald himself, is just waiting 
slightly offstage?

Such is the problem with 

prequels. For the audience to 
maintain interest the stakes have 
to be upped, but if the stakes are 
upped too high, it can undercut 
the narrative of the original 
story that the prequel is building 
towards. Peter Jackson’s “The 
Hobbit” trilogy fell straight into 
this trap. Instead of trying to make 
something different from “Lord of 
the Rings,” Jackson tried to make 
“Lord of the Rings” again. At times 
in this new “Fantastic Beasts” 
trailer, one can’t help but wonder if 
Rowling is heading down the same 
dark path. Surely, this is all leading 
to a scene two or three films from 
now where Dumbledore or Newt 
face off against Grindelwald in a 
wand-waving feat of fantasy filled 
with colors and explosions and just 
enough orchestration to stir the 
heartstrings of geeks everywhere. 
Will that be enough to satisfy the 
demands of the fanbase that grew 
up with Harry but who might now 
have kids of their own? Will it be 
enough to satisfy the bottom line 
needs of Warner Bros.? It seems 
unlikely. Just a few years ago, 
most people thought Harry’s story 
was over. Who doesn’t now think 
it will be only a matter of time 
before we see Daniel Radcliffe, 
Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and 
all the rest back on the big screen? 
With a world as expansive as 
Harry’s, in today’s day and age of 
IP recognition against all else, it’s 
a wonder the original films were 
allowed to end at all. The Boy Who 
Lived indeed. Perhaps one day soon 
we’ll be wishing that he hadn’t.

The Peril of Prequels

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

IAN HARRIS

It’s 
an 
undeniable 
epic: 

Stanley Kubrick’s classic film 
“2001: 
A 
Space 
Odyssey,” 

which turned 50 years old this 
past Apr., is known to be one 
of the most wildly influential 
films of all time. Pioneering 
visual effects, bold aesthetic 
decisions — including scene 
length, dialogue, music (or 
lack thereof) — and abstract 
plot 
classify 
the 
film 
as 

contemporary art. By itself, 
it can be an intense movie-
watching experience, given its 

length (just shy of three hours) 
and unconventional pace. But 
add a live orchestra, and you’ve 
got a new movie-watching 
experience entirely.

To kick off their 140th 

season, the University Musical 
Society presented “2001: A 
Space Odyssey” in conjunction 
with the Detroit Symphony 
Orchestra. 
Though 
Hill 

Auditorium seats over 3,500 
people, community members 
began lining up for the free 
event long before 8:00 p.m., 
and by the time it began, nearly 
every seat in the house was full.

The 
music 
featured 

in — and now cognitively 
inseparable from — “2001: A 

Space Odyssey” is almost as 
famous as the movie itself; the 
opening piece, a theme from 
the Richard Strauss tone poem 
“Also 
sprach 
Zarathustra,” 

begins with those iconic three 
notes — the root, the perfect 
fifth and the octave — (you 
know 
the 
three), 
followed 

by those next two notes, the 
dramatic half step between 
the minor and major third. 
It’s one of the most famous 
musical phrases of all time. 
I’ve heard it a million times 
before, and this was not my 
first time seeing the film. Yet 
there was something different 
about hearing the notes from a 
full, live orchestra, performing 

The Cat 

Beathes the 
Fresh Water

WARNER BROS.

‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ 
unites live music & film

MGM

right under a huge projection of 
the movie. 

The 
grandiosity 
of 
Hill 

added a sense of greatness 
to the event — even from the 
balcony, I could feel the energy 
of the hall, the audience and 
the cohesion of art in front 
of me. I’d never seen a movie 
and a live orchestra playing 
simultaneously, and as I sat 
watching it among the 3,500 
other people around me while 
the DSO played, I began to 
notice 
a 
strong 
similarity 

between the experience I was 
having and that of going to the 
opera. I don’t know exactly 
what it was that triggered the 
association, but watching the 
overarching story happening 
on 
the 
screen, 
with 
the 

orchestra and conductor on 
stage, reminded me of what it 
feels like to sit in the audience 
of a show like “La Bohème” 
or “Cosi Fan Tutti.” It’s an 
experience where you can see 
the instruments in front of 
you producing the sound that 
completes what you are visually 
intaking; it is an experience 
that is well-rounded — one that 
you can almost feel throughout 
your entire body, with all of 
your senses engaged in a way 
that doesn’t happen every day. 

This also got me thinking: 

While the music used in “2001: 
A Space Odyssey” was not 
written specifically for the 
movie, most films have scores 
that are commissioned for the 
sole purpose of complementing 
the movie at hand. Today, a 
few composers who are known 
for film scoring are household 
names: John Williams, Hans 

Zimmer 
and 
Alexandre 

Desplat, to name a few. The 
mental association of melodies 
with their respective movies 
— such as the “Indiana Jones” 
theme, the “Star Wars” theme, 
the “Pirates of the Caribbean” 
theme — is unbreakable. They 
are as essential to the movie as 
the plot itself. So why is movie 
music generally not taken as 
seriously as, say, the music 
written for operas by Mozart, 
Puccini and Verdi? 

In the Academy Award-

winning 1984 film “Amadeus,” 
Mozart is shown composing 
and 
conducting 
operas 
he 

has written — operas that are 
now considered some of the 
greatest and most famous of all 
time, such as “The Marriage 
of Figaro,” “The Magic Flute” 
and “Don Giovanni.” When 
his performances finish and 
the operas come to a close, 
we see the audience erupt in 
to applause and praise. He 
is portrayed as a rock star 
of his time. The stories that 
these operas reflect, however, 
already 
existed 
in 
some 

capacity 
before 
they 
were 

made into an opera by Mozart. 
“The Marriage of Figaro” was 
first a play, “The Magic Flute” 
is based on Viennese literature 
and “Don Giovanni” tells the 
much-performed story of Don 
Juan. But it is when Mozart 
tells these stories through 
music 
that 
they 
become 

something 
else 
entirely, 

evoking emotion in audiences 
that is only possible through 
music. 

There 
are 
fundamental 

differences between an opera, 

where the entire production is 
done through music, and a film, 
where the music is usually not 
the absolute focus, but the two 
may not be as contrasting as we 
might think. Rightly so, operas 
and films are not overtly 
considered to be competing art 
forms, as they embody quite 
different characteristics and 
require distinct preparation, 
pre-production 
work 
and 

post-production 
work. 
But 

as I sat watching “2001: A 
Space 
Odyssey” 
with 
the 

orchestra playing right there, 
I realized that, although the 
evolution 
of 
entertainment 

is often examined through a 
technological lens — beginning 
with early forms of radio 
and 
moving 
through 
the 

subsequent decades from there 
— it is worth considering the 
commonalities 
between 
the 

viewing experience of an opera 
and that of a movie.

Maybe 
having 
a 
live 

orchestra with a film screening 
will become more common and 
accessible; maybe audiences 
will like having a special, 
extravagant 
movie-going 

experience 
that 
parallels 

that of going to the opera, 
realizing 
it 
combines 
the 

excitement of seeing a movie 
with the exhilarating nature 
of 
seeing 
live 
performers. 

Maybe something like this will 
be the new iPic. Who knows. 
But either way, seeing “2001: 
A Space Odyssey” in this way 
completely 
transformed 
my 

experience watching the film, 
listening to the music live and 
understanding the marriage 
between the two.

‘Maniac’ doesn’t meet expectations

Filmmaker Cary Fukunaga 

was recently announced as the 
next director to helm the “Bond” 
franchise. A daring, creative 
artist with an incredible track 
record (including the acclaimed 
first season of “True Detective” 
and Sundance darling “Beasts of 
No Nation”), Fukunaga uses his 
artistic genius to great effect in 
Netflix’s “Maniac.” Despite a 
massive budget and star-studded 
cast, however, the series offers 
little of note.

“Maniac” 
takes 
place 
in 

futuristic 
New 
York, 
one 

where capitalism is taken to 
an untenable extreme. Owen 
Mulgrim 
(Jonah 
Hill, 
“The 

Lego Batman Movie”) is a rather 
depressed-looking heir of an 
industrialist family, forced to 
testify in the trial of one of his 
brothers while suffering from 
schizophrenic 
hallucinations. 

Meanwhile, Annie (Emma Stone, 

“Battle of the Sexes”) is a fellow 
New Yorker and the pair cross 
paths in a drug study conducted 
by a foreboding pharmaceutical 
company.

Not much else happens in 

the premiere. At the end of the 
episode, I still have no idea 
what the personalities of the 
characters are and 
the nature of the 
world they live in. 
Sure, 
everything 

is very pleasing to 
look at. This version 
of New York is dark 
and brooding (as almost every 
version of the future seems to be). 
The old computers contribute 
to a “vaporwave” atmosphere. 
The pharmaceutical company, 
headed by two Japanese doctors 
played 
by 
Sonoya 
Mizuno 

(“Crazy Rich Asians”) and Rome 
Kanda (“The Informant”), is 
sleek 
and 
minimalistic, 
the 

familiar intersection of analog 
and digital. The city is filled 
with services that make Uber 
and Doordash seem completely 
primitive; here, you’ll find people 

whose entire existences are 
dedicated to pestering you about 
products as well as services that 
provide replacement husbands 
for widows.

But beyond the pretty visuals, 

the pilot’s pacing is depressingly 
slow. 
Combined 
with 
the 

gloomy portrayal of the city, 

the 
40-minute 

running 
time 

feels more like 
an 
hour. 
The 

prologue 
wastes 

Justin 
Theroux 

(“The Leftovers”) 

with a dreary narration of dross 
about amoebas and the big bang. 
Unfortunately, Hill’s acting also 
contributes to the glacial pace. 
He stays on more or less the 
same note throughout the entire 
episode. He’s not emulating 
the stoic melancholy of Ryan 
Gosling in “Drive,” but rather a 
flat sadness, a single monotone 
expression glued onto his face. 
Even though Owen faces a series 
of 
disturbing 
hallucinations, 

including a recurring fictional 
brother who tells him to watch 

out for a “contact” who will 
help him in his quest to save the 
world, Hill’s acting never lets the 
viewer see beyond the surface of 
Owen’s psyche.

Meanwhile, Stone has little 

to do during the pilot beyond 
popping up here and there to 
encourage Owen’s delusions, but 
her acting is miles more vibrant 
and compelling. The few bright 
spots of the episode are taken 
up by the other characters, 
including Owen’s father Porter 
(Gabriel Byrne, “Hereditary”) 
and other members of the 
WASP-y, brash Milgrim clan.

Hopefully, “Maniac” speeds 

up 
and 
delves 
deeper 
into 

the 
inner 
workings 
of 
the 

pharmaceutical 
trial 
where 

Owen and Annie meet. The world 
the pilot sets up is intriguing in 
its own right, especially in its 
depictions of the gig economy on 
steroids, and there is potential 
to be explored. However, if the 
pilot’s issues are not resolved, 
there is little chance that the 
series develops into more than 
an utter borefest.

‘Maniac’

Netflix

My summer column “Riding 

the New Wave” began with a bit 
of a tongue-in-cheek introduction 
alluding to the dry and predictable 
intro-to-film-study watchlist that a 
student would be given in any film 
school anywhere (probably, I didn’t 
actually do very much research on 
that part). I think any angst I had 
about those sorts of unsurprising 
required viewings came from a 
long-held belief that there should be 
room in the arts for a more nuanced 
discussion on what it means to 
view a “classic,” and what the goal 
of those 90-or-so minutes might be. 

Because a lot of the time, no 

matter how much of a pillar 
of cinema — no matter how 
influential, inspiring or affecting 
— the film may be, it just might be a 
bit boring, a slow watch in the eyes 
of the stimulation-seeking modern 
viewer. At that point the divide 
between those who watch for 
nothing more than entertainment, 
and those who think of themselves 
as champions of “high-art” begins 
to rear its ugly face. I think locking 
someone into one side of that divide 
is terrible, and the column was my 
attempt to begin to bridge the gap, 
diving into the New-Wave back-
catalogue to try and find a selection 
of films that might satiate those 
on both ends of the spectrum. A 
starting point for those who want 
to watch something with some 
historical weight but might not 
have the cinematic stamina to 
make it through “Roshomon.” 
(As an aside, I made a few name-
dropping remarks like this in 
the other bookend of this series 
that didn’t sit well with a reader. I 
think the criticism of my criticism 
of criticism pushed the column 
to be more review-like and semi-
academic, which wasn’t what I 
necessarily wanted on the outset. I 
had hoped to make it a little looser 
and more readable, but I guess 
receiving diminutive feedback is 
the price you pay).

Now, that was the goal, not 

necessarily the execution.

I think there are two central 

flaws to the premise I just laid 
out. One being that, though I 
tried my best, I am not immune 
to my own preference, meaning I 
just plain didn’t like some of the 
movies that I watched, no matter 
how cinematically important they 
proport to be. I think, had I brought 
along with me a team of similarly 
motivated writers into the depths of 
the New Wave, we together would 
have been able to compile a more 
diverse list of films that can both 
hang with the “Casablanca”s of the 
world and manage to entertain in 
their own right. Specifically looking 
back at the series, I think the genres 
that Godard operates in just don’t 
excite me like they might someone 
else, making my hot-“Breathless”-
takes worthless. 

The other central flaw was the 

lack of representation. I ended 
up watching around a dozen 
midcentury French films over the 
summer, which just isn’t enough to 
fully put a finger to the pulse of the 
movement. This issue would have 
had a similar solution, enlisting 
some other writers to watch and 
critique with me, but this was 
supposed to result in a column, so 
that just wasn’t going to happen. 
However, I don’t want to spend this 
entire conclusion on the pitfalls of 
“Riding the New Wave” — at some 
point I need to start talking about 
the films.

So, without further ado, let’s 

begin with this fated fun and 
educational 
French 
film 
list. 

Clocking in at number one (one 
through three really) is the work 
of director Eric Rhomer. Rhomer 
made a series of six films in the 
late ’60s and early ’70s called 
“Rhomer’s Six Moral Tales,” and 
I watched the later half of the 
sextet for the fifth installment in 
the series. I think Rhomer’s films 
might be the best starting point 
for anyone looking to dip their toes 
in the New Wave, because they 
are very recognizable character 
studies that deal with somewhat 
flawed and adrift protagonists. The 
interpersonal dramas he places on 
screen have a lot of familiar and 
accessible elements that don’t lose 
anything over time. They’re also 
just wonderfully shot and paced 
(I think “Claire’s Knee” might be 
a five star film), and watching one 
after another has a cool effect, since 
Rhomer reuses the same basic story 
beats in each one — all of the moral 
tales are, in some way, about a man 
who drifts away from a love, only to 
return in the end.

The work of the two Left-Bank 

group directors that I watched 
would probably slot next in line. 
The 
Left-Bank 
group 
was 
a 

collection of directors who were 
separate from the original “Cahiers 
du Cinema,” the filmmakers who 
all got their start as critics at the 
same magazine. I wrote more about 
the similarities and differences in 

the sixth article of this column. The 
Left-Bank films I watched, “Cleo 
from Five to Seven” and “Umbrellas 
of Cherbourg,” are fairly different, 
but they noticeably set themselves 
apart from the “Cahiers” films. 
“Cleo” and “Umbrellas” seem 
more attuned to sensitivity than 
the works of Godard and Truffuat, 
the two leading Cahiers. The Left-
Bank films deal with less violence 
and criminality and end up feeling 
a lot lighter in general.

It feels strange placing them 

so low on my personal totem pole, 
but I just don’t think “Breathless” 
and “Jules and Jim” really hold up. 
They’re movies that have plenty 
of worth if viewing them in a 
specifically academic setting, but 
for the purposes of this column, I 
don’t think they’re the way to go. 

I hope in some strange way 

my 
previous 
eight-thousand 

disembodied words on classic 
French film has guided you 
towards a life of well-rounded 
cinema taste and appreciation. I 
hope that I haven’t dissuaded you 
from enjoying Godard or hating 
Rhomer — as it turns out, creating 
a list of films that is supposed to 
work for everyone is something I 
can’t do, because I am not everyone. 
Nonetheless, there is so much 
more past this column to discover 
and explore, and I would feel 
accomplished if I had motivated 
you to continue in even the smallest 
of ways. 

Riding the New Wave: A conclusion

FILM NOTEBOOK

CRITERION

I love staircases

NO FILTER

Freshman year, I lived on the 

eighth floor of South Quad, in 
the room closest to the elevator. 
When I say closest to the elevator, 
I mean legitimately right by it. No 
drab hallway standing in between 
the elevator and my door. If I was 
taking big strides, I could get to 
my door in five steps and fewer 
seconds. I could open and close 
my door faster than the elevator 
could do. If my roommates were 
particularly 
quiet 
any 
given 

evening, I could hear many a 
muffled “GOING DOWN” while 
dozing off. We had no neighbors, 
or perhaps we had the most, as that 
elevator room hosted more people 
over those two semesters than any 
cramped double ever could.

The 
two 
elevators 
were, 

initially, my friends. They lifted a 
bin full of all my crap for move-in 
up more stories than I ever could, 
and quickly to boot. On long, 
raucous nights, they offered me a 
rectangular chamber of reflection 
before I unskillfully climbed then 
crashed into my bunk bed. They 
made the wait for pizza or wings or 
cookies a bit more bearable.

The left elevator was inclined 

to break down, however, and I 
grew to fear it. Leaving for class 
one day and seeing a repairman 
lying prone on the floor, flashlight 
in hand, with cries for rescue in 
the distance didn’t help, either. 
There was a rare chance for one 
or the other or both to be caked 
with vomit, random expelled 
libations and burritos from the 
night before. And what could be a 
meditative sanctuary when alone 
was transformed into a playground 
for social anxiety when flanked by 
people on all sides.

There isn’t any specific day 

when it started, but not too long 
into my college career I tried 
to take the stairs as much as 
possible. All eight flights of them. 
“It’s exercise,” I chastised my 
sluggish self. That usually got me 
up and climbing after eating too 
big a helping of vanilla soft serve 
with my signature Fruity Pebbles 
garnish, or halfway through days 
with long breaks between classes 
and short walks. Yet I still tried 
to opt for the stairs on exhausting 
days, days where I rode multiple 
buses and walked across multiple 
diags and sat endlessly in multiple 
classrooms.

Maybe it was the possibility 

of saying hello to fellow 8th 
Huber residents because the most 
convenient staircase gave me a 
considerably longer path to my 
room than the elevator. Maybe it 
was the thought of what I would 

cinematographically 
look 
like 

dancing up the stairs from a static, 
exterior lens, as the eight windows 
only afforded glimpses of my 
gallivanting. Maybe what kept 
me stair-stepping was the bliss 
of stomping along synchronously 
to the beat of Franz Ferdinand’s 
“Take Me Out.”

A lot of stairways on campus 

are targets of ire, but I think they 
deserve better. (Except for any 
set of stairs in Mason Hall, which 
are all congested and clammy and 
as dreadful as the Math 116 class 
I had in that silly building). A 
staircase presents its own special 
experience: Walking up to the 4th 
floor of the MLB is an odyssey 
of lighting and varying stair 
width, the many floors of Haven 
Hall have a certain medieval bell 
tower-esque whimsy to them, the 
twisting stairs tucked in the side of 
the Union (may she rest in peace) 
allow for an interior appreciation 
of its ivy-covered architecture, 
Hatcher’s dueling grand staircases 
brace you for the studious battle 
ahead. A ride on an elevator is 
fundamentally the same now as it 
was 160 years ago when Elisha Otis 
was still farting around.

Stairs work our minds as much 

as they work our bodies by giving us 
a steadfast stage for contemplation 
and expression. They have a 
greater ability to move than their 
mechanical rivals, despite being 
set in stone. They provide a lush 
canvas as an artistic medium, from 
their tangible aesthetic flourishes 
to their ability to frame in film. 
Take “Inception,” a film whose 
lauded special effects could easily 
visualize the impossible Penrose 
stairs but could only make a scene 
in an elevator exciting through 
the addition of zero gravity. M. C. 
Escher might have been less of a 
household name if he decided to 
sketch endless elevators.

I’m not advocating for some sort 

of crusade against elevators — “Cut 
the Cables of Oppression!” — all 
I’m saying is that staircases have 
been here before elevators and 
will probably be here after. Stairs 
still remain more practical and 
important and ask your local fire 
marshal if you’re not convinced. 
You could ride the same elevator 
for a lifetime and have only a tiny 
fraction of the distinct experiences 
walking up the stairs would grant 
you.

I could escape into the stairwell 

of that first dorm of mine and leave 
my mom a voicemail telling her 
how much I love her and appreciate 
her after watching “Lady Bird” 
and noticing my family and the 
McPhersons have the same cherry 
red “You are special today” plate. 
I don’t think I could’ve spit out 
the same sentiment on a quick, 
crowded elevator ride.

Back from heart surgery, Beilein looks for normalcy

John Beilein nearly didn’t get 
a stress test.
He skipped it the first time 
— he had to go recruiting. 
He didn’t want to get on the 
treadmill, and he certainly 
didn’t intend to come back to 
the doctor’s office after leaving 
that day.
“Sort of the way I live my 
life,” Beilein said. “I was in the 
middle of it, and I had the first 
part of my physical — I always 
do it at the end of the year — and 
they said, ‘Well, it’s time for the 
stress test.’ I said, ‘Well, I only 
got 30 minutes, I gotta catch a 
flight.’
“So they said, ‘Well, let’s do 
it later,’ and I actually wasn’t 
going to do it.”
He did, and the test showed 
he 
needed 
a 
double-bypass 
surgery. 
He 
underwent 
a 
successful procedure on Aug. 
6, missing the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s trip to Spain 
as a result.

So, when Beilein sat at the 
podium Tuesday afternoon, let 
out a smile and said, “It’s great 
to be here,” it felt like he meant 
it.
He joked about spending 
more time on Twitter, not 
participating in a simulated 
airplane crash, getting a lot of 
reading 
done, 
watching 
the 
Cardinals 
get 
hot. 
Still, 
he 
seems 
pretty 
active 
for 
someone 
who 
had 
his 
chest 
opened 
up 
less 
than 
two 
months ago.
Beilein 
said 
he was walking 
five miles a day with his wife, 
Kathleen, within a week of the 
surgery. He’s back in practices 
and plans to coach in both 
the 
Wolverines’ 
closed-door 
scrimmage at Toledo on Oct. 
27 and their exhibition game 
against Northwood on Nov. 
2. Ditto for the Nov. 6 season 

opener.
When the team returned 
from Spain, Beilein eased back 
into things. He met with the 
five-man freshman class on 
the first day back, according 
to junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson, then the rest of the 
team a couple days later.
“He actually 
wasn’t 
vocal 
at all, he was 
kinda just saying 
a 
few 
things 
and 
stepping 
out of the way,” 
Simpson 
said. 
“Not 
yelling, 
maybe 
one 
or 
two 
sentences, 
stepping out of 
the way.”
For five brief minutes, when 
Beilein was told he needed 
surgery, there was a discussion 
as to whether or not the team 
should go to Spain at all. Beilein 
was all for it, installing assistant 
coach Saddi Washington as the 
interim head coach and sending 
his team on its way.

Michigan ended up going 1-2 
in three games against European 
competition, a worse result 
against far better competition 
than in Italy in 2014. Though 
Beilein missed time with the 
freshmen, it hasn’t been hard to 
catch up. He’s largely stayed in 
Ann Arbor instead of traveling 
to recruit and can spend four 
instead of two hours per week 
with the players.
Right now, ask around and 
the only tangible basketball 
impact of Beilein’s surgery is 
that he has taken a backseat 
in practices, unable to yell the 
way he might normally. The 
assistant coaches have picked 
up the slack in his stead.
“I feel like they all have a 
piece of their own pie — piece of 
the pizza,” Simpson said. “I feel 
like (DeAndre Haynes) is more 
of a player type of coach, that 
comes to you and compliments 
you or tells you things you could 
have done individually. And 
(Luke Yaklich) is extremely 
loud. He is extremely loud. Yak 
is definitely extremely loud.
“And Saddi’s just more the 
kind of mature one, that wraps 
up and summarizes everything. 
He’s the one who — he’s the one 
who’s kind of like the Coach B 
when Coach B isn’t there. He 
kind of takes over, he does — 
he’s not really a yeller, he’s not 
quiet. He’s just saying things to 
regroup us as a team, he’s just 
probably the most vocal one.”
Added Beilein: “I just stand 
in the middle and sort of talk, 
probably the way a lot of coaches 
do coach.”
By the time Beilein finished 
taking 
questions 
— 
having 
moved on from his own health 
to the progress of sophomore 
shooting guard Jordan Poole 
and 
comparing 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
to Scott Ungerer, a player 
he 
coached 
at 
Richmond 
from 1998-2002 — you could 
almost mistake it for a normal 
circumstance.
If Beilein has his way, come 
Nov. 6, it will be just that.

quarterback entered Saturday’s 
game 
against 
Nebraska 
after 
the Wolverines’ 
starters built up 
a 46-3 lead late 
into the third 
quarter.
On his first 
play, McCaffrey 
dropped 
back, 
side-stepped 
and saw a path 
down the left 
sideline to run 
with abandon. McCaffrey saw 
nothing but green in front of 
him, 
even 
adding 
distance 
between 
himself 
and 
the 
defensive back in pursuit into 
the endzone. But a holding 
penalty on redshirt freshman 
receiver Oliver Martin that 
sealed the edge for McCaffrey 
erased the most electric play of 
his young career.

“In all honesty, I didn’t 
think it was holding at all, so I 
just told him that,” McCaffrey 
said. “He agreed, but he was 
bummed like anyone would be.”
McCaffrey wasted no time 
making up for it. He threw 
two 15-yard throws on rollouts 
and had a 17-yard scamper 
on that same drive to set up a 
field goal. The next drive, he 
dropped a dime 
into the hands 
of 
freshman 
wide 
receiver 
Ronnie Bell for 
a 56-yard score. 
It’s 
give 
and 
take.
“Dylan 
continues 
to 
improve 
every 
time he gets in,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. “That’s a position 
like all the positions in football, 
but especially quarterback, it 
takes playing and having time 
on task and being out there. 
And it — he’s getting that. It 
doesn’t — it’s never too big for 
him. I really like that about 
Dylan.”
A few weeks prior, Harbaugh 
lauded his demeanor more 

succinctly — “coolness.” It was 
on full display in the season 
opener against No. 8 Notre 
Dame after Shea Patterson 
departed the game with leg 
cramps in the fourth quarter. 
With Michigan within two 
scores, 
McCaffrey 
entered 
a game for the first time in 
his college career — let alone 
at a critical juncture — and 
completed four 
of 
six 
passes 
before Patterson 
returned. 
“Right away, 
you could tell 
he 
brought 
confidence 
to 
the 
huddle,” 
said 
redshirt 
junior tight end 
Zach 
Gentry. 
“He 
hadn’t 
skipped a beat, 
he completed some passes, did 
what he needed to do. … You can 
never really tell if he’s nervous. 
He talks really steady and just 
makes plays.”
Assumed backup Brandon 
Peters was injured prior to that 
game, making McCaffrey the de 
facto No. 2 quarterback. And he 
ran with it, cementing himself 
as the next man up during 

garbage time in the Wolverines’ 
following 
three 
contests. 
Through three appearances, 
McCaffrey has compiled just 
126 yards and two touchdowns, 
but a poise that has excited 
Michigan faithful.
From 
the 
sidelines, 
McCaffrey has reconciled his 
position — perpetually waiting 
in line — with a quote from his 
coach.
“Coach 
Harbaugh 
actually 
said 
something at the 
end of practice 
the other day 
that 
really 
stuck with me 
personally,” 
McCaffrey 
noted. “He said, 
‘It’s 
better 
to 
be 
prepared 
and not get your opportunity 
then it is to be unprepared and 
get your opportunity.’ I think 
that’s just something you’ve 
gotta live by. You don’t wanna 
go out there and have no idea 
what you’re doing.
“... It’s just one of those 
things you’ve gotta prepare like 
you’re one play away because, 
frankly, you are.”
It’s 
why 
McCaffrey 
continually does what he refers 
to as “mental reps.” Last year, 
as a member of the scout team, 
McCaffrey 
would 
listen 
to 
what plays were being called 
on the sideline, double-check 
with the play calls listed on his 
wristband and evaluate what 
he would do as the plays would 
unfold on the field.
Following Harbaugh’s words, 
results from his preparedness 
have been positive so far this 
season.
“Dylan’s come a long way,” 
Gentry said. “I know that’s 
one of the guys that stays after 
practice a lot and gets route 
timing with extra guys, gets 
some extra reps.”
McCaffrey still has ways 
to go before finding himself 
in the lead role. It probably 
won’t happen while Patterson 
is still here. But either way 
he’ll be prepared, even if the 
opportunity never comes.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Redshirt freshman quarterback Dylan McCaffrey has compiled 126 yards and two touchdowns in three appearances.

In fifth season, Marshall 
finally getting chance

The Michigan football team 
left no doubt with a 46-point win 
over Nebraska. The Wolverines 
dictated both sides of the ball 
throughout Saturday, racking up 
nearly 500 yards while collecting 
14 tackles-for-loss defensively.
It makes it easy to forget what 
could’ve been.
After a 32-yard pass play 
early in the first quarter, the 
Cornhuskers fooled senior VIPER 
Jordan Glasgow with a read-
pass-option, leaving receiver J.D. 
Spielman completely uncovered 
on a slant pattern. A completion 
might’ve gone the distance with 
Glasgow so out of position.
But just as Adrian Martinez 
set to throw, fifth-year senior 
defensive 
tackle 
Lawrence 
Marshall stuck up his left arm 
and batted the pass into the hands 
of junior safety Josh Metellus. It 
was a critical play — Michigan 
turned a potential defensive 
miscue into a touchdown drive 
shortly thereafter.
“I read it was a pass, and 
(defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg) 
Mattison always says ‘get your 
hands up,’ ” Marshall said during 
Tuesday’s press conference. “I 
got my hands up, got a piece of the 
ball — wish I had gotten the pick.”
Though Marshall didn’t get 
his wish, it was one of the most 
significant plays of his long but 
limited time with the Wolverines. 
Briefly a four-star Ohio State 
recruit before committing to 
Brady Hoke’s staff in 2013, 
Marshall had just 11 career 
tackles at the end of last season. 
And after undergoing a move 
from defensive end to the interior, 
his future at Michigan seemed 
murky.
But in the loss of Maurice 
Hurst, 
Marshall 
saw 
an 
opportunity. 
“I felt like with Mo Hurst 
(graduated) the spot was open,” 
Marshall said. “I wasn’t gonna 
walk away. A lot of guys second-
guess their skills, and they go 
someplace else in a lower division. 

I told myself, ‘I can play here. 
There’s no doubt in my mind.’ ”
Naturally however, Marshall 
did have his moments of doubt.
“You really be like, ‘Man, am 
I really good?’ ” Marshall said. 
“Or you really start thinking and 
second-guessing your skills. For 
myself, I just kept going through 
it, trying to get better and better.”
Marshall said he’s adjusted to 
defensive tackle by remembering 
what Hurst did in his Michigan 
tenure — in addition to watching 
Hurst’s current tape with the 
Oakland Raiders. That, combined 
with an entire summer dedicated 
solely to refining interior line 
technique, has Marshall feeling 
more confident than ever.
“I 
really 
started 
feeling 
comfortable this year,” Marshall 
said. “Fall camp (is) when I 
really got my feet wet. Last year, 
I understood it, but I didn’t know 
how to play it right.
“I know the game much better 
now. Just looking at how Mo 
played and just coming off the 
ball fast, reading my keys and 
knowing what the offensive line’s 
gonna do. I’m looking at the splits. 
I can tell if it’s a tight split, most 
likely you’re gonna get double-
teamed.”
The work paid off when 
Marshall received his first career 
start at Notre Dame. Rotating 
with juniors Carlo Kemp and 
Michael 
Dwumfour 
in 
the 
absence of sophomore Aubrey 
Solomon, his group has become 
more productive by the week. 
Marshall hasn’t had the career 
he 
probably 
expected 
when 
committed to Michigan. But six 
years later, his efforts are finally 
getting rewarded with consistent 
snaps. 
“I didn’t play my freshman or 
sophomore year, barely played 
my junior year,” Marshall said. 
“Really started to see the field my 
senior year. It’s just perseverance 
— just keep going through it. I 
started my first game my fifth 
year.
“It’s amazing really getting the 
chance to play. Showing my skills 
on the field is a great feeling.”

“I said, ‘I only 
got 30 minutes, 
I gotta catch a 
flight.’ ”

“Dylan 
continues to 
improve every 
time he gets in.”

“He talks 
really steady 
and just makes 
plays.” 

Wolverines top Buckeyes 
in dominant fashion, 3-1

The field was opening up for 
the Michigan men’s soccer team.
Senior midfielder Ivo Cerda’s 
inspired run from the center line 
into the box culminated in a pass 
played into the feet of sophomore 
forward Umar Farouk Osman. 
Osman skillfully held up the ball 
and nudged it to Jack Hallahan 
standing right on the edge of the 
18-yard line.
The junior attacker chopped 
the ball back onto his right foot 
and unleashed a curling shot into 
the top corner.
“I knew that a guy was behind 
me,” Hallahan said. “I saw his 
shadow come in, so I chopped 
it 
backwards 
knowing 
I 
would beat him 
— knowing the 
keeper was set off 
guard, so I had a 
go and got lucky.”
If 
the 
Wolverines 
(2-0-1 Big Ten, 
6-1-1 
overall) 
sat 
comfortably 
before, now with 
a three-goal advantage, they 
switched into cruise control 
against Ohio State (0-2-1,1-6-2). So 
much so that the Buckeyes were 
able to pull one back in the dying 
embers of the game, making the 
final scoreline 3-1, in Michigan’s 
favor.
The Wolverines maintained 
control 
throughout. 
Senior 
defender Daniel Mukuna headed 
home a corner kick from Hallahan 
in the 21st minute to open the 
scoring.
Prior to the end of the first half 
though, Mother Nature made her 
presence known. The teams had 
to endure a 50-minute lightning 
delay before they could finish out 
the remaining 4:18.
“We waited,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “But as soon 

as we figured out the timing, we 
just kinda went back in and said, 
‘Hey, we don’t want to have a lull 
after the long break. Let’s get out 
and focus on getting things right.’ 
Passing the ball properly and 
getting back to competing as well 
as we did in the first half.”
Half-time was shortened to 
just two minutes and when play 
resumed, the Wolverines picked 
up right where they left off.
Ohio State’s occasional spell 
of possession was cut out by the 
Michigan backline while the few 
chances the Buckeyes had early 
in the second half amounted to 
nothing. At the same time, the 
Wolverines hung onto their one-
goal lead and would’ve liked 
insurance.
With 
frustrations 
mounting 
on 
both sides, the 
game 
became 
somewhat 
chippy. 
Players 
on each team 
received yellow 
cards and free 
kicks 
became 
frequent.
The 
rising 
pressure 
was 
alleviated 
for 
Michigan in the 74th minute when 
Osman capitalized on a rebound 
opportunity, neatly placing it past 
the Ohio State goalkeeper.
The remaining 15 minutes, 
though eventful, proved fairly 
easy for the Wolverines, who 
now turn their attention to the 
meat of their schedule against 
powerhouses No. 2 Indiana, No. 5 
Michigan State and No. 20 Notre 
Dame.
“Not every game is going to be 
comfortable late in the game at 
3-0, so we want to make sure we 
have good habits and continue to 
build,” Daley said. “The strength 
of our schedule is to come — the 
challenge is in front of us. We’re 
up for it, there is no question about 
it.”

Mark Schlissel gave me 

writer’s block

P 

resident 
Mark 
Schlissel 

apparently lives in a beautiful 
white 
house 
on 
South 

University and I was going 
to see it. I was going to see it 
because I emailed a professor 

that I needed a building to write about, 
and of the hundreds in Ann Arbor, not a 
single one felt curious enough for a story.

“Break into Mark Schlissel’s house!” he 

wrote.

“Will I be arrested?” I wondered.
“I’m just an Idea Guy!” he replied.
It was an idea, and one I needed, since I 

signed on to write about buildings for The 
Daily’s Statement magazine this semester: 
To turn immobile structures into however 
many 
thousand 
romantically-tainted 

words on a semi-regular basis. When 
I applied, I felt I had a lot to say on the 
subject, and I wanted to force myself to 
write.

The weather was awful the day I first 

set out to see the President’s House. I left 
around noon and faced the September mix 
of warm humidity and cold wind that begs 
both for shorts and a flannel, and doesn’t 
blink an eye at the contradiction. I wore 
neither, and downed a Claritin instead, as 
September not only gifts split personality 
weather but also searing and persistent 
allergies.

W

hen me found out I’d 
been hired to work at The 
Daily I wuz so excited, I 

screemed.

If you cringed while reading this 

sentence, then I highly recommend 
you consider working as a copy editor 
for The Michigan Daily. My interest 
in joining Copy can be attributed to 
one of the reasons I similarly decided 
to become an English teacher: I 
enjoy working with the mechanics 
of writing — pulling a sentence apart 
one word at a time, deciding whether 

to use an em dash or a semi-colon and 
trying to gauge whether a sentence is 
approaching a run-on or not (take this 
sentence, for example).

At the same time I began working 

at The Daily last fall, I also began to 
attend the class English 305: Exploring 
the English Language. There I met a 
professor and linguist named Anne 
Curzan, 
who 
matched 
and 
even 

exceeded my passion for syntax and 
phonetics. She centered the course 
by introducing two contrasting ideas: 
prescriptive and descriptive grammar.

Prescriptivism 
can 
best 
be 

symbolized by the “red pen wielding” 
English teacher trope. This teacher 
uses “whom” in sentences and says 
you may go to the bathroom regardless 
of whether you can. A prescriptivist 
believes there is a correct way to speak 
a language, and in English that correct 
way is typically standard English (the 
English we see in most academic and 
corporate settings).

A descriptivist, on the other hand, 

views all the dialects of English equally 
in an attempt to understand linguistic 

change over time. 
This 
doesn’t 

mean there aren’t 
rules 
to 
each 

dialect — quite 
the 
opposite 
— 

but the main goal 
of 
descriptivism 

is 
to 
observe 

and 
analyze 

dialectical 
variety 
rather 

than 
to 
pass 

judgement 
or 

enforce usage.

While 
a 

prescriptivist 
might say English 
is “deteriorating” 
with 
newer 

generations, 
a 

descriptivist 
would 
say 

it 
is 
merely 

“evolving.”

English 
305 

came 
at 
an 

amazing time in 
my development 
as a student and 
future 
educator. 

For 
the 
first 

time, 
I 
began 

to 
question 

the 
“rules” 
of 

language I had 
been 
taught 

in 
schools. 
I 

soon 
realized 

I was a descriptivist surrounded by 
institutions like print media and 
education where prescriptivism has 
historically been imposed and, at 
times, lauded. Even now, many of 
my fellow copy editors rejoice in the 
“comforting” laws of the stylebook, 
and I empathize with them. I too have 
gone to look up how The Daily formats 
numbers and I have found solace in a 
concrete answer (the answer: Numbers 
from one to nine are written out, while 
10 and above are numerals).

But it is important to not mistake the 

laws of the stylebook with universal 
truth. In the process of making an 
article more “standard,” am I not 
still projecting a voice, a style, a bias? 
What we’ve come to know as standard 
English is not devoid of connotation, 
and it’s important to recognize at 
a 
prestigious 
university 
like 
the 

University of Michigan, where test 
scores measuring standard English 
literacy play an important role in who 
gets to be a part of the Leaders and Best. 
I don’t mean to say we shouldn’t teach 
or uphold standard English; I believe 
there is value in standardization in 
certain contexts. But when we perceive 
standard English as “unbiased” or 
“just reporting the facts,” we cease to 
read critically and consider the author 
behind the text.

While I still love my position as a 

copy editor at The Daily, I’ve begun to 
see the stylebook in a more nuanced 
light, as both a beneficial resource and 
a potential gatekeeper to marginalized 
individuals for whom standard English 
is a second language. Now, each time I 
edit an error in a columnist’s writing, I 
am conscious of the system to which I 
am adhering in the process.

As writer Rita Mae Brown said, 

“Language exerts hidden power, like 
the moon on the tides.”

It is the responsibility of readers and 

writers alike to consider these hidden 
power structures of language, and only 
by doing this may we progress in the 
right direction.

Cancun the Promised Land of 

American Plight

T

here are certain places I tend 
to avoid when I return to 
my hometown after a year 

away at college. The notorious town 
watering 
holes: 
June 
graduation 

parties, the grocery store on Sunday 
evenings, 
Starbucks. 
These 
three 

places can all be classified by their 
likelihood of neighborhood small talk, 
typically conversations that often 
prompt questions concerning my own 
college experience.

I stepped off the plane and walked 

down a ramp, only to be bombarded 
by salesmen promising their best 
offers. To say it was nauseating would 
be an understatement.

The moment you arrive in Cancun, 

Mexico, you see its natural beauty 
exploited and merchandised to satisfy 
an American clientele. Back and forth 
you are dragged by people giving 
you packets to explore the area. The 
prices are in bright red colors, but the 
salesman looks you in the eye and say, 
“For you ma’am, half the price.”

Before you can step outside to 

find a cab, you have already told 20 
people that you don’t want to buy 
their tourist brochures. Finally, a 
cab. I reach the hotel and I think, 
“I have found peace,” but instead I 
spend the next two hours listening to 
a representative tell me all the things 
the hotel offers. I am gifted perfume 
and 20 additional packets.

Cancun has become the exploited 

mistress of a tired United States. 

I walk down to the beach and 

promptly three hotel workers come 
by to ask me if I’d like a drink. I 
kindly refuse and lay there looking at 
the white sandy beaches, wondering, 
“is this really living?”

I get up to jump into the pool, hoping 

the water is cooler than the beach. 
My senses are quickly overwhelmed. 
There are five restaurants, three 
pools and workers everywhere. One 
of the pools even has a swim-up bar.

I am swimming, but I can’t really 

focus because I hear the voices of 
drunk Americans sitting at the bar 
acting like they rule the world, telling 
their neighbors rather loudly how 
successful they’ve been in life. Drink 
after drink, the voices get louder. 
They never have to leave the hotel. 
They have a pool, the beach, food, 
stores and drinks all in front of them. 
The food is catered to Americans: 
cheese 
quesadillas, 
burgers 
and 

wings. Almost like “The Truman 
Show,” I was in Mexico, but was it 

really Mexico?

I leave the hotel for dinner. On my 

way, I see an infinite row of hotels. 
Once I get to the restaurant, I realize 
that — complete with bright lights, 
people in flamboyant costumes and 
beautiful women dancing— I have 
arrived in Las Vegas. The entire 
strip was an exploited American 
idealization. I see stores like Gucci 
and Hermes, I see clubs that are 
playing Beyoncé and other American 
hits. The scene is adorned with 
classics like Outback Steakhouse and 
Hooters. It felt like Cancun was this 
strip of beauty that served to give 
Americans the world traveler status 
with all the comforts of home. It was 
all too much.

Rather overwhelmed by Cancun, 

I get in a taxi and ask to go to some 
unknown cities, far-off beaches or 
perhaps the Mayan ruins.

In the backseat of the car, I realize 

it takes only 10 minutes to leave the 
commercial Cancun. The taxi driver 
starts chatting and I find out that 
this is the low season. He says the 
real business is Spring Break, when 

all the underage Americans come to 
party because this is where they can 
drink. He tells me how President 
Donald Trump, a former real estate 
developer, wanted to build a hotel 
here but the city said no. He says 
this with pride. The more we drive, 
the more I start to see Mexico — the 
Mexico I had fallen in love with. He 
talks to me about politics and the 
recent presidential election.

Suddenly I am in a different city. 

I get out of the taxi to look around, 
and I ask him to wait. I start walking 
unflooded by tourist packages. I 
actually realize I don’t understand. 
I am hearing neither Spanish nor 
English. The people on the streets 
are speaking in their indigenous 
languages. Finally, a restaurant with 
soft shell tacos de barbacoa. I see the 
hustle and bustle. The landscape is 
no longer in English and overflowing 
with white tourists.

The next day the same taxi driver 

takes me to the Mayan ruins. Here I 
marvel at the impressive history. A 
city and an old empire that had more 
civilization than the wild parts of 

resort Cancun. On the drive back, the 
taxi driver tells me he used to live in 
the United States. He turns around 
and says, “I almost tried to go back, 
but as I faced the border I said it’s not 
worth it.”

I didn’t know how to reply. I was 

smacked with my own privilege. I 
could travel freely. I could enjoy 
Mexico because the dollar-to-peso 
exchange is in our favor. Yet, I didn’t 
want to go back to the U.S., nor did I 
want to go back to my hotel, but this 
was a choice. I wanted to stay and feel 
the humidity and to feel lost because 
I couldn’t speak Mayan.

It began to feel like the resorts and 

hotels populating the strip of Cancun 
were where tourists went to have 
their egos inflated, to be promised 
the “cultural experience,” to be 
treated like royalty with staff at hand 
and to drink. This was not the Mexico 
that I love but this was still a part of 
her truth. Cancun is a reminder that 
you can sell anything to an American, 
but like the Gucci belts at the market, 
there’s no guarantee of authenticity.

Mark Schlissel gave me writer’s block

by Matt Gallatin, Statement Correspondent

U

niversity of Michigan Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel appar-
ently lives in a beautiful 
white house on South Uni-

versity Avenue and I was going to see it. 
I was going to see it because I emailed 
a professor that I needed a building 
to write about, and of the hundreds in 
Ann Arbor, not a single one felt curious 
enough for a story.

“Break into Mark Schlissel’s house!” 

he wrote.

“Will I be arrested?” I wondered.
“I’m just an Idea Guy!” he replied.
It was an idea, and one I needed, 

because I signed on to write about build-
ings for The Daily’s Statement maga-
zine this semester: To turn immobile 
structures into however many thousand 
romantically-tainted words on a semi-
regular basis. When I applied, I felt I had 
a lot to say on the subject, and I wanted to 
force myself to write.

The weather was awful the day I first 

set out to see the President’s House. I left 
around noon and faced the September 
mix of warm humidity and cold wind that 
begs both for shorts and a flannel, and 
doesn’t blink an eye at the contradiction. 
I wore neither, and downed a Claritin 
instead as September not only gifts split 
personality weather but also searing and 
persistent allergies.

My goal for this visit to Schlissel’s 

white picket fence home was to spark 

some initial inspiration that I could 
hopefully run with, as I had an arti-
cle due within a few days. I would give 
myself those days to complete research 
and finalize the writing.

I was hoping the visit would spark 

my inspiration because truthfully, I was 

lacking motivation. I was too preoccu-
pied with the book I was reading, the boy 
I was seeing, the baffling strangeness of 
weather in September.

But by the time I reached the back-

side of the Hatcher Graduate Library and 
came upon the austere home, I had com-
pletely forgotten my intentions. Glanc-
ing through the cracks of the fence into 
the prim backyard with its proper glass 
porches stirred nothing in me. I merely 
checked my phone twice for texts as I 
passed, wondered why there were none, 
and wondered if it was something I said. 

I 

failed before I began, but I refused 
to believe it. I would not let my 
emptied-headedness preclude me 

from finishing such important work. I 
had an article to write, and like any sea-
soned professional college journalist, I 
turned to the sources: Wikipedia, Google, 

three Advil and a large glass of wine.

The President’s House is the oldest 

remaining building on the University’s 
campus. It was constructed to be a facul-
ty residence when the University moved 
from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and 
construction was completed in 1840. The 
first president to move into the home was 
Henry Phillip Tappan in 1852, who was 
also the first official President of the Uni-
versity.

The house has undergone extensive 

renovations over the last two centu-
ries, some of the grandest of which are 
described in the nomination for the 
home’s entry into the National Register 
of Historic Places.

“In the 1860s the central mass assumed 

its present appearance. The half story 
became a full third story; the roof was 
altered to a truncated hipped roof; dou-
ble brackets were added; the cupola was 
replaced by a balustrade; and the house 
took on an Italianate cast. Later, some-
time after 1875, the artificial mortar 
courses were filled in. The house’s four 
chimneys and seven fire-places are origi-
nal as well as the flat roofed Greek reviv-
al portico.”

Renovations continued on the home 

well into the 1980s. Some are document-
ed by Anne Duderstadt, wife of James J. 
Duderstadt, who became University Pres-
ident in 1988. In a photographic essay, 
Anne Duderstadt describes her odyssey 
with the home:

“The toilet from the first floor bath-

room (to be the handicapped bathroom) 
was on the dining porch. The front yard 

was totally dug up, and the side porch 
was gone. Cigarette butts were scat-
tered all over the floors by the workmen. 
The University decorators were walking 
through the house with carpet salesman 
deciding what THEY were going to do 
with the house. Suddenly, the house was 
not as ‘beautiful’ as I had remembered.”

When I went back to the President’s 

House later that evening and looked at 
the many Italianate windows fronting the 
home, peered again at the large wooden 
fence surrounding the porch and looked 
between the pickets, I could not think 
much of Anne Duderstadt and her domes-
tic horror. I simply could not see it: There 
were no toilets on the porch, no cigarette 
butts on the floors scattered by workmen 
and no University decorators with unsat-
isfactory ideas of their own.

I saw only how strange it was for a 

22-room home to not have a single light 
on; felt only that it is a bit of a waste for 
a home so extensively and expensively 
renovated to sit alone, emptied, unoccu-
pied, surrounded by a tall fence and cut 
off from the world. Mostly, the image of 
the lonesome home under the moonlight 
made me tired, nostalgic and wishful of 
my own apartment. It made me want to 
go home.
T

his is the heart of the problem. 
This is the reason I have not 
been capable of being the sort of 

writer I have wanted to be. I am incapable 
of reading about a 22-room home without 
thinking about my own single bedroom; 
incapable of counting the windows of the 
President’s House without waiting for 
my phone to ring; incapable of listing the 
date of the President’s House’s construc-
tion without thinking about the first time 
someone held my hand in public and I 
didn’t flinch. I am always distracted.

In my sophomore year, I misread a 

question on a history midterm and gave 
an incorrect response. In a flowing email 
to my professor, I apologized profusely 
and asked if it was at all possible to take it 
again, and if not, if there might be a way 
to make it up to him.

He responded “Focus, my boy, Focus!” 

and allowed me to redo the question. I 
have tried hard since to heed his warn-
ing. I have only ever been less successful.

Writing, at least for me, is one of those 

specific forms of masochism that asks for 
regularity but demands ingenious spon-
taneity. I mean writing happens only at 
one time of day, when the whole day has 

been exhausted, probably nursing a head-
ache, and when there is absolutely noth-
ing else to do. There are no other options. 
It’s when I remember, for a minute, for an 
hour, for an evening, that things just don’t 
make any sense. At least, they don’t make 
sense like I’d like them to. Nothing is left 
but to try and explain this to myself.

I am always explaining to myself, never 

to anyone else, no matter how often I try 
otherwise.

The reason this has always struck me 

as a bad thing, and the reason I say it pro-
hibits me from being the kind of writer 
I have wanted to be, is because I have 
created, for right or for wrong, an ideal 
in my mind of the kind of person that my 
distractedness disallows me from being. 
This ideal me would not walk by Schlis-
sel’s house and check their phone twice 
instead of taking notes on the number of 
windows and the year it was built. This 
ideal would not veer direly off the topic 
of their assignment. This ideal wouldn’t 
turn Schlissel’s house into a metaphor.

This ideal is an abstraction, and a vague 

one. I am unsure if anyone exists who 
truly manifests it. But I have been led to 
believe someone does — even many some-
ones — and it is that belief that has made 
the difference. When I walk down the 
street, I see not a hundred students with 
their own anxieties running to class, but 
a mass of people who have it figured out 
and do not worry about things like empty 
houses and phones that don’t ring — peo-
ple who do not try to explain themselves.

It is absurd to believe that, of course. 

Everyone experiences fears and doubts 
and worries, I am well aware of this. That 
doesn’t mean it’s not easy to fall into such 

a simplification when you lack the con-
text of each person you pass.

Simply, it is impossible to know the 

anxieties behind every blank face, and so 
it is difficult to imagine those anxieties 
exist at all: I did not see the girl in a yel-
low sundress who I just passed on State 
Street crying in the bathroom stall 20 
minutes before, then wiping her mascara 
slowly in the mirror. Perhaps, with some 
imagination, I can picture her crying. 
But I cannot in a way that would make it 
tangible, make it real; not in a way that 
would make me feel it quite like I would 
if I actually saw her wiping her makeup.

These abstractions of worriless people 

exist only in a present moment. They 
have never had pasts and they have never 
had futures. They are the cool-looking 

guy in the corner of the party who hasn’t 
spoken a word, and because he hasn’t 
spoken a word, you assume that he has 
it all figured out. In all likelihood, he 
doesn’t know what the hell is going on, or 
he’s just way too high to be at this party. 
It doesn’t matter though. I have imparted 
a coolness on him anyway, and already 
feel inferior. That cool-looking guy has 
always been at the party, and he will 
never leave it.

So writing is very uncool, because 

writing is trying like mad to explain 
yourself, and in explaining yourself, you 
are admitting you don’t know it all, and it 
bothers not to know it all; whereas “cool” 
is the appearance of a) not having a care 
in the world and b) having it all figured 
out. I have never met someone who liked 
to write who wasn’t at least a bit neurot-
ic, or who had much at all figured out.

I have only ever felt uncool when writ-

ing, and thus embarrassed. I have only 
ever felt like I wished I hadn’t said what I 
finally ended up saying.
A

bout two years ago, I wrote 
a piece for The Daily during 
which I came to terms with 

the fact that I was gay. The next day, it 
was colder than usual, and I had on the 
same red sweater I’d worn nearly every 
day that month. I waited for the eleva-
tor to my class in Angell Hall. It arrived, 
I entered and right as the door began to 
close, my professor stuck in his hand, 
and the elevator doors opened again to 
let him in. It was the same professor who 
told me “Focus, my boy, Focus!”

He looked at me. He was silent a 

moment, and then began to say, in a 
hushed, matter-of-fact tone, that he had 

read my article, and, well, that he did not 
understand what exactly I had meant 
by it. I told him matter-of-factly that I 
did not know what I meant by it either, 
except that it was melodramatic and best 
not to be taken seriously.

It would have been much harder to take 

myself seriously. I felt, at least, very seri-
ous when I had written it. But I had con-
vinced myself almost immediately that I 
did not deserve to be taken seriously, and 
so I joked about how dramatic I had been, 
and I made fun of myself for it. To ask to 
be taken seriously would have been to ask 
to be empathized with, and in quite plain 
terms, I did not believe I deserved it.

Later that week, I saw a photo of myself 

in the red sweater I’d worn so often, and 
was taken aback. I had thought it fit quite 

well and I liked it a lot. But when I looked 
at myself in the photo, it looked all wrong. 
The sleeves were too large. My head was 
bloated when framed in the shade of red 
and the collar style. I threw the sweater 
out that evening. I would never be able to 
wear it again.

Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette comes to 

mind here. When she explains how she 
used jokes to cope with her coming out 
story, I felt it as if she stood there in the 
room, scolding me like a loving older sib-
ling:

“I froze an incredibly formative expe-

rience at its trauma point and I sealed it 
off into jokes. And that story became a 
routine, and through repetition, that joke 
version fused with my actual memory of 
what happened.”

Months ago, I emailed The Daily and 

asked them to scratch my name from that 
article my professor in the elevator had 
not understood. I understood completely 
what I had said in it. I only wished I had 
not said it. Nothing in the article was 
untrue. I had had those feelings. I only 
no longer felt that way, that it was such 
a big deal to be gay — perhaps no longer 
felt it by the time the article was even 
published; and to read something writ-
ten by someone who was me, yet terribly 
and completely no longer was me, was 
painful, disturbing and sad. It was see-
ing a photo of yourself with a bad hair-
cut years before, a haircut you loved for 
so long, and finally realizing that you 
should have just cut off the mane. Above 
all, it was embarrassing.

The future version of myself did not 

believe the prior one deserved empa-
thy. In a more stable and assured place, 
I looked down upon a version of myself 
that was more unsure. I wanted only to 
erase his existence entirely, and create a 
“me” that had only existed in the present, 
like that cool-looking boy at the party: 
always there, never leaving.

My article was physical evidence that 

not only had I been late to the party, but 

that I would surely leave it soon enough.

But we cannot delete the person we 

were before we arrived. We cannot ask 
the kind editors at The Daily to scratch 
away their existence. What we are say-
ing — what I was saying — when I tried 
to erase the existence of that past version 
of myself is that he did not deserve to be 
empathized with. When we preclude a 
prior version of ourselves from empathy, 
and when we know that our present will 
never last, we say, in short, that we have 
never and will never deserve it. And I 
can’t believe that’s true. 
I 

tried to go to the President’s House 
again. This time more than ever I 
was hell-bent on writing the arti-

cle I was supposed to. Whatever I’d find 
was more necessary, I knew — I thought 
— than whatever I’d been ranting about 
in my head: perhaps an in-depth history 
of its renovations, a telling of the process 
of installing its complex indoor and out-
door watering system, commentary on 
the time the Duderstadts spent $70,000 
replacing a turquoise carpet.

It was cloudy outside, the wind was 

blowing, and for the first time I realized 
fall really was coming, global warming 
hadn’t created the eternal summer I’d 
always asked for, and there was nothing 
I could do about it. The trees around the 
President’s House swayed dangerously, 
and two passing students with large 
black backpacks, matching Michigan 
t-shirts and weary eyes appeared to wake 
up from their trance to give me an odd 
look; I standing in front of the building, 
still and starry eyed.

It didn’t look like anyone was home. I 

wondered if a story would appear to me if 
I walked up to the house, unannounced, 
and asked a few questions. The driveway 
is short. It took only a few moments to 
reach the door. But when I got to there 
and looked inside, again, it looked only 
emptied, and I could not for the life of me 
bring myself to knock.

Student athetes’ silent struggle 
with eating disorders 
A

mong student athletes, there’s 
a fine line between being 
mindful of your health and 

becoming obsessed with it.

“Take care of your body,” motivational 

speaker Jim Rohn writes. “It is the only 
place you have to live.”

Despite the changes wrought by 

puberty, aging and disease, the body 
is singularly constant. To some extent, 
we feel we should be able to control the 
functions, size and abilities of our body. 
It is somehow both us and beyond us — 
ours but not always ours to control.

Athletes, 
whose 
identities 
are 

often directly tied to the capacities of 
their bodies, experience particularly 
powerful 
and 
complex 
mind-body 

relationships. In sports where a specific 
bodily aesthetic is tied to an athlete’s 
ability to perform — gymnastics, for 
instance, or wrestling — participants 
are much more likely to suffer from 
poor body image and dysfunctional 
eating.

I was a competitive Irish dancer 

for 10 years, and while I never had an 
eating disorder, I understand what it is 
like to desperately want your body to be 
able to do something. There’s a sense of 
frustration I think most athletes have 
experienced — anger, not at yourself 
exactly, but at your body’s refusal 
to cooperate with your ambition. I 
see how that exasperation, under 
certain circumstances, could twist 
the commitment to a sport into an all-
consuming quest for the unattainable.

The 
general, 
non-student-athlete 

population of college students is already 
at an increased risk of developing an 
eating disorder. Transitional periods 
are recognized as especially vulnerable 
times for the development of disordered 
eating. For most students, the freedoms 
and rhythms of college present a radical 
difference from the prescribed routines 

they have lived within for the first 18 
years of life. In an unfamiliar place, 
surrounded 
by 
strangers, 
students 

may feel their eating habits are the 
one aspect of their lives over which 
they have control. A desire to fit in 
— combined with fears about the 
mythical “Freshman Fifteen” — can 
also contribute to an emerging eating 
disorder. Among student athletes, these 
concerns intersect with the pressures 
of staying competitive in their sport.

There are many misconceptions and 

myths about eating disorders, partially 
due to the influence of inaccurate 
media portrayals. Here is some basic 
information.

People who suffer from anorexia 

nervosa do not eat a healthy quantity 
of food due to a serious psychological 
fear of gaining weight. They often 
rapidly lose weight and do not maintain 
sufficient body fat. Anorexia can also 
lead to other serious medical issues, 
including osteoporosis, cardiac arrest 
and even death. 

People 
with 
bulimia 
nervosa 

attempt to reduce calorie absorption 
by throwing up or abusing laxatives, 
and some sufferers may binge — eating 
excess amounts of food — before 
purging. People who frequently binge 
on food and do not purge have binge 
eating disorder.

Orthorexia, which is not formally 

recognized by most psychiatrists, is an 
uncontrollable obsession with healthy 
eating.

Though 30 years of made-for-TV 

movies argue otherwise, young, thin, 
wealthy white teenagers are not the only 
sufferers. A person of any age, gender, 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, weight and 
socioeconomic status can have an eating 
disorder.

A 2009 study found about 18 percent 

of 
students 
reported 
behaviors 

associated with an eating disorder 
in 2005 and 2007. A 1999 study found 
one-third of NCAA Division I female 
student athletes reported behavior that 
categorize them as at risk for anorexia.

While most colleges and universities 

have resources for students struggling 
with eating disorders, these programs 
are not always well-publicized.

LSA senior Julia McMahon, program 

assistant at the Body Image and 
Eating Disorder Program of Wolverine 
Wellness, explained students often 
enter college with concerns about 
gaining weight.

“I 
was 
an 
orientation 
leader,” 

McMahon said. “A lot of people are 
scared about, ‘How will I eat in the 

dining halls?’ and the Freshman Fifteen 
and other food- and body-oriented 
things.”

Though representatives of M-Dining 

speak to incoming students about 
dietary restrictions during orientation, 
eating disorders are not covered.

“It’s not a priority of the University to 

talk about those things,” said McMahon. 
She thinks this oversight may be due to 
time constraints, because orientation 
is only two days. Additionally, the 
complexity of these issues makes them 
hard to address in a short presentation.

LSA junior Celia Gold trains at 

Ann Arbor’s Wolverine Strength and 
Conditioning — a gym that specializes 
in CrossFit, a high-intensity fitness 
program. Gold said being an athlete has 
always been a big part of her identity. 
Beginning in elementary school, she 
participated in softball, soccer and 
basketball, and she stuck with lacrosse 
and cheerleading through high school. 
But as her passion for sports blossomed, 
so did her self-consciousness.

“I tried Weight Watchers when I 

was 12,” she explained. “As a girl, I was 
always self-conscious about my body 
and all I cared about was being skinny.”

Her high school coaches weren’t 

particularly helpful in promoting a 
healthy attitude toward exercise and 
nutrition.

“In 
high 
school, 
especially 
in 

cheerleading and lacrosse, I don’t 
feel there was ever an emphasis on it 
(nutrition),” she said. “I wish I knew 
then what I know now about food and 
fuel.”

Gold’s relationship with her body 

suddenly changed during her junior 
year of high school, when she started 
CrossFit.

“I would really restrict calories,” 

explained Gold. “My mom knew how 
obsessed with working out I was and 
she started doing CrossFit and brought 
me into that. That was the first time I 
saw working out as a performance thing 
and not an aesthetic thing.”

Gold 
didn’t 
just 
enjoy 
CrossFit 

and weightlifting, she also showed 
exceptional 
talent 
for 
both. 
Four 

years later, her hometown coach from 
CrossFit RedZone in Newtown, Conn., 
is still training her. Gold regularly 
enters both the CrossFit Games and 
weightlifting 
competitions, 
most 

recently for Team USA at the 2018 Pan 
American Junior Championships in 
Colombia.

“For me, I feel like CrossFit was the 

first time I admired what my body could 
do versus what it looked like. That was 

really huge for me,” explained Gold.

Gold, emphasized the importance of 

fellowship when it comes to promoting 
healthy eating habits among young 
student-athletes.

“It’s cool to have a community of 

strong girls emerging from the CrossFit 
and weightlifting world,” she said.

It is a generous and admirable thing 

to devote yourself wholly to an athletic 
pursuit the way Gold does, to spend your 
days pushing outward the boundaries 
of your abilities. The challenge — one 
that Gold, like many athletes, once 
struggled with — lies in preventing that 
dedication from turning into something 
darker. How easily tenacity can sour, 
morphing into a compulsive desire for 
complete dominance over one’s body.

The 
high 
prevalence 
of 
eating 

disorders and poor body image among 
student-athletes is not the kind of 
problem that can be traced to a single 
source of malevolence or systemic 
dysfunction. It is far more complicated 
than that — a Gordian knot of societal 
expectations, genetic predisposition, 
ambition and intimate social influences.

Some solutions are obvious. Coaches, 

for example, should be better educated 
to promote a healthy attitude toward 
exercise and nutrition and better 
equipped to intervene when one of their 
athletes presents signs of an eating 
disorder. But much of the issue feels 
frustratingly nebulous, its many layers 
presenting a unique challenge.

Perhaps the first stop-gap measure 

to creating a culture where eating 
disorders are less common is to begin 
meeting our own bodies with kindness, 
in the hope that it strengthens our 
resolve to treat others’ bodies with 
an unconditional respect. This is no 
easy task for anyone, of course, and 
for athletes it is especially tricky. It is 
difficult enough to locate the division 
between healthy zeal and sickness; it is 
quite another to resist crossing it when 
your culture, coaches, teammates and 
personal goals all seem to suggest you 
might benefit from doing so. But before 
the glory and after the disappointments, 
there must be a middle ground: fervor 
without agony, gusto tempered by self-
empathy.

The poet Mary Oliver writes, “As 

for the body, it is solid and strong and 
curious and full of detail: it wants to 
polish itself; it wants to love another 
body; it is the only vessel in the world 
that can hold, in a mix of power and 
sweetness: 
words, 
song, 
gesture, 

passion, ideas, ingenuity, devotion, 
merriment, vanity, and virtue.”

T

he internship searches have 
morphed into job searches, 
the sought-after executive 

board positions are now ours and our 
points have gotten us up to the front 
rows at the football games; after three 
short years, we’ve become seniors.

And in eight much shorter months, 

we’ll be alumni.

Most of us, myself included, can 

probably remember — as much as we 
might try to forget it — our freshman 
orientation, the day we moved into 
our first dorm room and (believe it 
or not) getting to our first class 15 
minutes earlier than Michigan time 
(RIP) required, utterly overprepared.

The last three years have gone 

by faster than any of us expected — 
much faster than the first three years 
of high school. Most likely, even for 
those of us that peaked then too.

Scrolling 
through 
Instagram 

Sept. 4, with the endless “last first 
day” captions, brutally reminded 
me of how much longer I have here. 
It brought an onslaught of stress 
mixed with sadness and a tinge of 
excitement.

I’ve seen my own focus and that 

of my friends shift from the next 
semester or year to the next five or 
10 years. We’re now wondering where 
we’re going to be come May of 2019 
(or, avoiding that thought like we’ve 
avoided 8:00 a.m. classes for the past 
seven semesters).

Don’t 
get 
me 
wrong, 
that’s 

important. I don’t think any of 
us want to wake up the day after 
graduation, fight our way through 
our likely fuzzy thoughts and realize 
we have no idea what we’re going to 
be doing the next day (though, for 
some of us, this might be the first 
time while living in Ann Arbor that 
we’re happy about a 12-month lease 
ending in mid-August).

The stress of a job search forces 

me to have tunnel vision toward 
the future, blocking out everything 
else that’s going on around me and, 
inevitably, keeping me from truly 
embracing this last year.

But it dawned on me that I’ll never 

again be around the people I’m 
surrounded with now. That brought 
me back to reality, back to where I am 

now. Soon enough, there won’t be any 
midnight trips to Pinball Pete’s the 
night before an exam, nor shutting 
down bars (at least in Ann Arbor), nor 
midnights at The Michigan Daily.

It’s easy to see if I don’t cherish the 

time and people I have here, eight 
months will come and go, and I really 
won’t be ready to graduate and move 
on from Ann Arbor.

Talking to a friend who graduated 

a few years ago, I mentioned the trips 
out to Colorado with the snowboard 
club, the weekend trips to New 
York, the overnight fly fishing trip 
for a king salmon run in northern 
Michigan that went terribly wrong.

What struck me was that he told me 

he wished he had spent his time like 
that, instead of completely focused on 
where life would be taking him.

That’s not to say I’m doing things 

right. I don’t think any of us will find 
that perfect balance of being here, 
embracing our senior year, all while 
preparing for the future. But that’s 
not to say it isn’t worth trying. 

After we graduate, everything will 

change. Some of us are ready for 

that change, ready to move on, while 
others surely aren’t. But until May, 
until we’re no longer undergraduates, 
we can’t lose sight of where we are 
now.

Things won’t ever be like this again. 

Soon enough, we’ll be full-fledged 
adults dealing with our full-fledged 
debt. But for now, embrace living with 
your friends in your shitty houses (or 
expensive, nice apartments), dealing 
with shitty landlords.

So moral of the story — sorry for 

the cliché — stop and smell the roses. 
This ride is coming to an end soon, 
but don’t land preemptively.

Take that trip. Get coffee with that 

friend you haven’t seen in months. Go 
to that show, party, movie the night 
before an exam.

It’s scary that there’s an end in 

sight, undoubtedly. But I just hope 
once I fight through my own haziness 
the morning after graduation, I think 
to myself, “I did it, and I’m ready for 
what’s next.”

Seniors, prepare for landing

Sonja is from Pinckney, Michigan and has been driv-
ing for the University since April. Prior to working for 
the University, she has also been a transit operator for 
Dexter and Pinckney in the last three years. She says 
that despite it’s high stress nature, she loves the job: “All 
the students make it very fun, but also a great learning 
experience and the people I work with are great and it’s 
been a great experience and I want to stay here.”

Nathan is an undergraduate student at the University 
studying music education. He’s been driving since the 
beginning of the summer, and likes being a transit opera-
tor. When asked if there was anything he’d like students 
to know about the people who transport them around 
campus every day, he replied “We do have schedules 
and we don’t have arbitrary times that we take breaks… 
it’s not our fault if there isn’t a bus there.” He said of 
driving for the University “you’re also with union driv-
ers and it’s kind of a divide...but we all treat each other 
pretty nicely, it’s a good place.”
