CIVIL LIBERTIES CHAT

UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES
UHS still

System works
to accomodate
students more
efficiently
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
Since eliminating walk-in
services at University Health
Services this summer to cut
down on wait times and better
serve students, UHS officials
are continuing to transition into
implementation of the program
during the academic year.
The new policy, enacted on
May 13, requires students to
make an appointment to see
a UHS health specialist, and
no longer offers walk-in care
except in serious, circumstantial
cases. Though the system was
designed to more efficiently pro-
vide health care services to stu-
dents, UHS is still in the process
of getting accommodated with
the new system.
Since eliminating walk-in vis-
its, UHS director Robert Win-
field said UHS is still adjusting
to managing the larger student
body during the academic year,
as opposed to the lower popula-
tion of campus residents in the
summer when the program was
first launched.

"We really didn't have any
experience with the kind of
volume we see," Winfield said.
"During the summer and spring
it was really slow."
In addition to high demand
from patients, UHS is undergo-
ing personnel changes. Win-
field said six providers - which
accounts for a quarter of the
staff - are out of the office for
various reasons, or have recently
retired.
However, efforts are being
made to accommodate for the
school year's increase in demand
and to smooth the transition into
hiring new staff members.
"We are doing rapid cycle
quality improvement, which is
if we find something that's not
working, within a week we try
and fix it," Winfield said. "We
tweak the schedule or the way
the waiting room is working."
Winfield said the high volume
of walk-in demands coupled
with low satisfactioni with the
waiting experience led to the
change in service offerings to
appointment-only.
"The outcome of the larger
walk-in efforts of the past two
years resulted in the inability
to control the distribution dur-
ing the day, and more and.more
people would be coming in in
the afternoons or late mornings
and we simply couldn't handle

The aim of the proposed

dent's degree by integrating

Wooten, the associate dean of
undergraduate programs at the
Business School, said.
If adopted, she said the
minor will target the high
demand for business courses
from non-business students

and will be helpful for students
as they pursue future degrees

During this year's recruit-

of Greek Life found an even larg-
er sea of women lining up on the
lawns of their sorority houses

than in years past.
LSA senior Laura Raines, the
vice president of public relations
for the University's Panhellenic
Association, said the number of
students registered for Panhel-
lenic recruitment - a process
consisting of four sets of events
over the span of three weeks and
culminating in the addition of a
new pledge class to teach soror-
ity - grew by about 50 to 100
more women compared to last
year.
Raines said she has noticed a
trend of increasing participation

in recruitment over the past few
years.
"We're just really excited
that more people decided to go
through recruitment," Raines
said. "We're expecting a larger
pledge class this year as well."
Panhellenic sororities will
give out more bids this year,,
which quells the 'assumption
that more women involved in
recruitment will create a more
competitive environment for

It's called epizootic hemor-

a type of biting fly called a midge.
 The disease is on the rise

said Monday..
Police Chief Charles McClel-

Iran official says

boycott Oscars
An Iranian film won an Oscar
in the foreign film category in Feb-
ruary. But Mohammed Hosseini
said the Islamic Republic would
not field an entry for next year's
awards due to the low-budget
video he dubbed "an intolerable
insult to the Prophet of Islam," the
semiofficial ISNA news agency
reported. Hosseini urged other
Islamic countries to also boycott.
He confirmed that the commit-
tee in charge of selecting Iran's
entry has already picked "Ye Hab-
beh Ghand," or "A Cube of Sugar"
- a film about a family wedding
turning into a funeral when the
groom's relative dies - to compete
for best foreign film.
Iranian director Asghar Far-

hadi won the 2012 Oscar for best
foreign film for his movie, "A Sep-

Iran.
TRIPOLI, Libya
Libya appoints
military officers to
head militias
Libya's military command
appointed Monday a pair of army
officers to head two powerful
Islamist militias in the country's
east, part of the government's
push to rein in armed factions.
The move reflects the pressure
on the government to control or
disband the country's militias,
many of which it had relied upon
for securing Libya in the turmoil
following last year's ouster and
killing of longtime leader Moam-
mar Gadhafi.
Col. Ali al-Sheikhi, the spokes-
man for Libya's joint chiefs
of staff, told the news agency
LANA that the chiefs of the
Rafallah Sahati Brigade and the
Feb. 17 Brigade, two groups that
authorities had allowed to man-
age security in the eastern city of
Benghazi, would be replaced with
army commanders.

to embroil China

Bo Xilai's right-
hand man gets 15
years in prison
CHENGDU, China (AP) -
China has nearly mopped up a
murder scandal that has roiled
the country for months, but the
last step - dealing with a fallen
political star who was once
among the Communist Party's
most popular figures - will be
the most delicate of all.
Bo Xilai's former right-hand
man and police chief, Wang
Lijun, was sentenced Monday to
15 years in prison for making a
thwarted defection bid, and for
helping Bo's wife cover up the
murder of a British businessman.
Bo's wife and other figures in the
scandal were sentenced previ-
ously, and Beijing is keen to settle
the fate of Bo himself before a
once-a-decade change in leader-
ship expected nextmonth.
Ever since Wang's thwarted
defection bid at a U.S. consul-
ate in February made the scan-
dal public, the question of what
to do about Bo, then a powerful
party boss in Chongqing city,
has bedeviled Chinese leaders. It
strained relations among Com-
munist Party power brokers
just as they were cutting deals
to transfer of power to younger
leaders; deciding whether- ,to
prosecute him or merely purge
him from the party became part
of the bargaining.
Wang's trial and verdict bode
ill for Bo. The official account of
the trial implied that Bo ignored
his wife's involvement in the
murder after Wang told him
about it. Though it referred to Bo
by his position rather than his
name, the account marked the
first time in weeks of trials that

Bo was mentioned in anyway.
In sentencing Wang, the
court emphasized his help in
the murder investigation against
Bos wife, who was convicted
last month, and in exposing the
crimes of unspecified others.
"He apparently got credit for
turning against" Bo andhis wife,
said Dali Yang, director of the
University of Chicago Center in
Beijing. "The revelation against
Bo Xilai provides ground for the
central leadership to dismiss Bo
formally and, if they choose to
do so, presumably to bring crim-
inal charges."
Debating Bo's fate is one
of the issues that has delayed
announcement of a National
Party Congress, a pivotal event
in installing the new generation
of leaders.'With verdicts in for
Wang and Bo's wife out of the
way, leaders are next expected to
announce dates for the congress
and for a preparatory meetingto
deal with Bo.
"The lack of a date for the
congress appears to be evidence
still of divisions over Bo and the
final leadership lineup, as well
as questions of political reform
and other sensitive issues," said
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, head of
the department of government
and international studies at
Hong Kong Baptist University.
Bo's case is extremely sen-
sitive because of his political
pedigree and his popularity.
The son of one of the commu-
nist state's founding fathers,
Bo has deep connections across
the party, government and mili-
tary. He was one of 25 Polit-
buro members and became
popular nationwide through
high-profile policies in Chongq-
ing, including a crackdown
on organized crime run with
police chief Wang.

gathering held each September,
which he cited as proof that he
is open to understanding other
countries' views.
In spite of his assertions on
the importance of dialogue and
respect for others, Ahmadinejad
presented a hard line in many
areas. He refused to speak of
the state of Israel by name and
instead referred only to the
"Zionists," and when asked
about author Salman Rushdie
he made no attempt to distance
himself from recent renewed
threats on the author's life ema-
nating from an Iranian semi-
official religious foundation. "If
he is in the U.S., you should not
broadcast it for his own safety,"
Ahmadinejad said.
He said this would be his last
trip to New York as president of
Iran, because his term is ending
and he is barred from seeking a
third consecutive term. But he
did not rule out staying active
in Iranian politics and said he
might return as part of future
Iranian delegations to New
York.
Ahmadinejad said the argu-
ment over Iran's nuclear pro-
gram was a political rather than
a legal matter and needs to be
resolved politically.
"We are not expecting that
a 33-year-old problem between
America and Iran to be resolved
in speedy discussions, but we do
believe in dialogue."
Later in the day, Ahma-
dinejad took aim at both the
United States and Israel while
addressing a high-level U.N.
meeting promoting the rule
of law, accusing Washington
of shielding what he called a
nuclear-armed "fake regime."
His remarks prompted a walk-
out by Israel's U.N. Ambassador
Ron Prosor.

some 800 people, mostly in Asia,
in a 2003 epidemic.
In the latest case, British offi-
cials alerted the World Health
Organization on Saturday of the
new virus in a man who trans-
ferred from Qatar to be treated
in London. He had recently trav-
eled to Saudi Arabia and is now
being treated in an intensive
care unit after suffering kidney
failure.
WHO said virus samples from
the patient are almost identical
to those of a 60-year-old Saudi

national who died earlier this
year. The agency isn't currently
recommending travel restric-
tions and said the source of infec-
tion remains unknown. Still, the
situation has raised concerns
ahead of next month's annual
Hajj pilgrimage, which brings
millions of peopleto Saudi Arabia
from around the world.
Health officials don't know
yet whether the virus could
spread as rapidly as SARS did
or if it might kill as many peo-
ple. SARS, which first jumped
to humans from civet cats in
China, hit more than 30 coun-
tries worldwide after spreading
from Hong Kong.
"It's still (in the) very early
days," said Gregory Hartl,
a, WHO spokesman. "At the
moment, we have two sporadic
cases and there are still a lot of
holes to be filled in."
He added it was unclear how
the virus spreads. Coronavi-
ruses are typically spread in
the air but Hartl said scientists
were considering the possibility
that the patients were infected
directly by animals. He said
there was no evidence yet of any
human-to-human transmission.

New York City hospitals crack down
on junk food in vending machines

Bloomberg trying
to eliminate
unhealthy food
NEW YORK (AP) - People
nervously waiting around in
New York City hospitals for
loved ones to come out of sur-
gery can't smoke. In a few
months from now, they can't
have a supersized fast-food soda.
And soon, they won't even be
able to get a candy bar out of the
vending machine or a piece of
fried chicken from the cafeteria.
In one of his latest health
campaigns, Mayor Michael
Bloomberg is aiming to banish
sugary and fatty foods from both
public and private hospitals.
In recent years, the city's 15
public hospitals have cut calories
in patients' meals and restricted
the sale of sugary drinks and
unhealthy snacks at vending
machines. But now the city is.
tackling hospital cafeteria food,
too. And the Healthy Hospital
Food Initiative is expanding its
reach: In the past year, 16 private
hospitals have signed on.
Earlier this month, the city
moved to ban the sale of big

sodas and other sugary drinks
at fast-food restaurants and the-
aters, beginning in March. Crit-
ics say the hospital initiative is
yet another sign that Bloomberg
is running a "nanny state," even
though the guidelines are volun-
tary and other cities - including
Boston - have undertaken simi-
lar efforts.
Hospitals say it would be
hypocritical of them to serve
unhealthy food to patients who
are often suffering from obesity
and other health problems.
"If there's any place that
should not allow smoking or try
to make you eat healthy, you
would think it'd be the hospi-
talk," Bloomberg said Monday.
"We're doing what we should
do and you'll see, I think, most
of the private hospitals go along
with it."
The cafeteria crackdown will
ban deep fryers, make leafy
green salads a mandatory option
and allow only healthy snacks
to be stocked near the cafeteria
entrance and at cash registers.
At least half of all sandwiches
and salads must be made or
served with whole grains. Half-
size sandwich portions must be
available for sale.

"People sometimes right now
don't have healthy options," said
Christine Curtis, the city Health
Department's director of nutri-
tion strategy. "So you are there at
2 in the morning and maybe your
only choice is soda and chips."
Marcelle Scott brought her
own chips and soda into the
lobby of Manhattan's privately
operated St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital - there was no vending
machine in sight - as she waited
for her daughter to give birth
Monday. It wasn't the first time
the unemployed security guard
from the Bronx got the "munch-
ies" for junk food to keep calm
while awaiting the outcome of a
loved one's medical procedure.
"I like my Snickers and my
Mars Bars - especially if I'm
nervous for somebody who's
inside," she said.
Most hospitals have already
overhauled their vending
machines by allowing only two
types of 12-ounce high-calo-
rie beverages at each vending
machine - and they must be fea-
tured on the lowest rack. Hospi-
tal vending machines have also
swapped out most baked goods
for snacks like granola bars and
nuts.

Internet opens education
Take advantage of free online courses
The University, along with 32 other leading colleges around
the world, is bringing college-level courses to millions of
interested individuals for free. Using Coursera as a plat-
form to host nearly 200 interactive massive open online courses, the
institution are opening up higher education and making world-class
instruction accessible to more than one million students across 196
countries. The University's initiative to participate in this program
is commendable, and more universities should follow suit and offer
open access to educational resources.

Coursera is a social entrepreneurship com-
pany founded in April by two computer sci-
ence professors at Stanford University hoping
to revolutionize the educational landscape
through an online network of freely acces-
sible college courses. These courses range
from thearts and humanities to engineering
and the hard sciences. The online accessibil-
ity of higher education has become a signifi-
cant focal point for institutions and students,
as they are accessible to all and serve as a
complement to traditional university courses.
As a nation that emphasizes higher edu-
cation and a globally competitive workforce,
the need for affordable and accessible higher
educationis more important thanever. Unfor-
tunately, college is becoming more expensive,
with a growing number of students unable to
keep up with rising tuition costs. Now with
Coursera and a working Internet connection,
anyone can freely take classes from ten of
these topuniversities. The program offers not
only high-caliber education to the public, but
it's also intended to complement the course-

work of college students by working with
partnering institutions to establish accred-
ited certification programs for to incentivize
students to complete courses
The certification program is one of two key
factors that make Coursera unique amongst
other similar programs. The second is Cours-
era's focus on student interaction with the
information through corresponding assign-
ments. This underlying pedagogical phi-
losophy of retrieving, reconstructing and
rewarding what has been taught is thought
to foster long-term retention and spur fur-
ther learning. In this way, Coursera is able to
bridge the current gap between high-qual-
ity education and easy access that has only
served to frustrate universities to this point.
With every increased tuition dollar, more
and more students are kept from receiv-
ing a higher education. Universities should
continue to use resources like Coursera to
break down such barriers and make higher
education a reality for more people around
the world.

Both parties are making an
economic promise they most
likely won't be able to keep.
Since the 2012
presidential
campaign really
started gettiwg
going almost a"
year ago, we've
heard candi-
dates from each
side of the ticket JAMES
make their case BRENNAN
to solve our
economy's cur-
rent woes. Democrats argue for
government investment in infra-
structure, education and new ener-
gy. Republicans, as expected, take
the opposite position, hoping to end
the country's fiscal and employment
problems with sweeping tax cuts
and deregulation. However, there
is a common thread between these
two opposing arguments - manu-
facturing jobs.
Since pulling ourselves out of the
Great Depression while simultane-
ously winning the Second World
War, America has prided itself on the
,creation ofconsumergoods. But with
the advent of globalization, free trade
and a new world economy, manufac-
turing has fallen off a cliff. In 1978,
more than 19 million people in the
U.S. were employed in manufactur-
ing, specifically. In 2010, that num-
ber dropped to 11.7 million. The auto
industry has been hit just as hard, as
the United States now only produces
approximately five percent of the
world's automobiles.
Candidates have taken full politi-
cal advantage of the situation. Man-
ufacturing plays an integral role in
the campaigns of both President
Barack Obama and Republican
candidate Mitt Romney. Romney
gave a speech-turned-commercial
before last year's State of the Union

address inside a factory in Tampa,
Florida. Earlier in the summer, the
Obama team produced an ad in,
which a worker described how Bain
Capital shut down his factory under
Romney's direction.
Manufacturing is a soft spotfor
Americans, especially for so many
middle-income people who fear
being laid off. These people - who
work low-skill jobs for a moder-
ate income - are the people really
depending on the outcome of this
election. They are the undecided
voters who will ultimately make the
difference in who our next president
will be; voting for who they believe
will "bring back manufacturing
jobs." Sadly, both candidates are sell-
ing a fake product.
Take a look at China, the United
States' biggest economic competitor.
In terms of labor, China is essentially
the opposite of what we as a country
have attempted to be over the last 70
years. Chinese labor laws and safety
regulations are virtually non-exis-
tent. Furthermore, they've slapped
foreign products with unreasonable
tariffs, so while they take jobs from
the United States, they also deter
their 1.3 billion person population
from buying American goods.
Here's the hard truth: the manu-
facturing jobs that have left the
United States are likely never com-
ing back. We would all love to see
the abandoned factories that poli-
ticians speak in front of once again
hum with workers and the produc-
tion of goods that are now exclu-
sively labeled "Made in China."
Unfortunately, this isn't going to
happen. The vast majority of goods
produced in the world take mini-
mal skill to create, and to a busi-
ness owner, a worker in China is
the same as a worker in America.
The difference is that the Chinese
worker will cost.pennies on the dol-

coming back
without change
of policy.
Barring a Chinese revolution and
the immediate overhaulof labor laws
and regulations, goods will continue
to be far less expensive to produce
overseas. Lowering taxes on busi-
nesses may help slightly, but our
rates are already among the lowest in
the world. Tariffs of our own could
help to break even with Chinese
costs, but starting a trade war with
the people lending us money to make
our society livable is not exactly an
ideal diplomatic situation. If either
party would like to offer a real solu-
tion to our current economic crisis,
they should look elsewhere. The
increased necessity for energy-effi-
cient products of all shapes and sizes
could be the next economic boom -
a sector requiring high-paying jobs
and some good old American inge-
nuity. In reality, clean energy could
likely be what the dot com explosion
was of the 1990s. That is, if govern-
ment and private industries play
their cards right. But if America
keeps bluffing on this idea of con-
sumer manufacturing jobs coming
back as our big winner China will be
the one to hit the jackpot while we go
poor playing the penny slots.

How do we know what we do about the
structure of the cell? Many people take this
knowledge for granted, because it's diffi-
cult to understand how this was discovered.
In doing so, the general public has ignored
the great men whose work made these dis-
coveries possible. Too often the public -has
embraced a monumental discovery such as
the structure of the cell, but neglected to
embrace the people behind the magic. Their
stories deserve to be told.
One such magician is Jacob Schaefer, a
doctor and professor at the Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis. Schaefer is considered a
frontrunner for the Nobel Prize and visited
the University this Friday for a Biophysics
Seminar series. Schaefer is a champion of
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
-I'm sure organic chemistry students just
shuddered. NMR, despite its unwieldy
nature, is probably the single most powerful
tool available to any chemical-based research
field, including all forms of chemistry, bio-
physics and biochemistry. In fact, the same
technology that powers NMR also powers
the more familiar Magnetic Resonance Imag-
ing.machines used by physicians worldwide
to diagnose diseases. NMR gives research-
ers unparalleled access into the structure of
even the smallest biomolecules. And Schaefer
made it even easier to see into the microcosm.
His work is indispensable to modern chemis-
try and biophysics, akin to developing a magi-
cal tool to look into the cell.
In 1976, he paired together two tech-
niques to revolutionize the way NMR works.
Cross-polarization magic angle spinning
is essential to many fields of biochemistry.
This rare technique can be applied to solids,
including native tissue samples. It is used in
protein determination and other structural
discoveries of key biomolecules. Metabo-
lomical studies, which is the analysis of
small molecules in order to profile cells and
determine disease diagnosis and prognosis
and, incidentally, the field of research I
am in with the Ramamoorthy group - is
also dependent on CP-MAS. By focusing on
the sensitivity of low gamma nuclei, which
takes much longer to detect, and increas-
ing the resolution of the spectra by spinning

samples at the magic angle of 54.7° - the
angle of the Cube behind the Michigan
Union - radical new insights into the struc-
ture of the human body at a molecular level
have been reached. The increase in clarity
of a molecule is equivalent to a jump from
analog transmission to a 1080p HD feed.
Schaefer looked into the abyss of molecular
geometry and saw a way out.
Schaefer also devised a second technique
to enhance solid-state NMR. In 1989, he
invented rotational-echo double resonance.
With this technique, the distance between
nuclei can be measured to within a couple of
angstrom, which is much more accurate than
the X-ray diffraction technique used in DNA.
This technique has wide-reaching applica-
tions in biology and in material sciences. Dr.
Schaefer himself used this technique to dia-
gram distances between complex molecules
and other intact substances - including a
structural definition of bacterial cell walls
- such as the peptidoglycan outer wall, pro-
tein-DNA complexes, intact bacteriophages,
which include viruses that can be used as
antibiotics against diseases such as leprosy
and cholera. It can even reveal the structural
distances of human cells and tissues.
You maybe wonderingwhyyou should care
about someone who has basically made fan-
cier ways to look at a molecule. His advances
moved NMR from the physical realm to :the
biological and chemical realms. His tech-
niques are being used in medicinal microim-
aging, pushing the realms of a MRI beyond
what we have now, thus helping to create a
world where we can see into the very atom-
ic structure of a person. His techniques are
being used in labs at the University of Michi-
gan to look at the structure of bone. We can
now see what a bone looks like in its native
state. We can see the atomic structure of a
bone, thanks to Jacob Schaefer. He himself is
pushing the bounds of his field. Even at the
age of 75, this remarkable man is developing
ways to look at the cell, one atom at a time.
He's essentially mapping the cell wall.
His story was told on Friday. It's now time
for us all to listen in.

labor instead of being repulsed.
It's an overt explanation of Dan-
ny's expectation of masculinity,
but without belittling feminin-
ity. He has nothing to say about
sports and skills, but speaks to
the subtler agents of masculinity
to which real, live men can relate.
In the kind of conventional
rum-com both Mindys would
eat up, Danny is the perfect
opposition to a lead female: the
surly, reluctant but inevitable
love interest. But Kaling's fan-
tastic writing team deals with
even that relationship expertly.
Kaling and Messina's characters
interact with the wonderful ease
of two people who have known
each other well for years; the
chemistry is undeniable, yet the
prospect of romance is actually
uncertain.
Despite how handsome and
charming he is, there's some-
thing repellent about Jeremy
Reed (Ed Weeks, "Olivia Lee:
Dirty, Sexy, Funny"). He's the
George Wickham to Mindy's
Elizabeth Bennett - but vapid
and possessing zero character
depth. It's empowering to know
that Mindy is regularly getting it
from an attractive doctor with a
poetic soul, but it's immediately
clear (to her as well as the audi-

ence) that he represents every-
thing she dislikes about herself
and will only inhibit her person-
al growth.
The beauty of "The Mindy
Project" is that Kaling isn't act-
ing at all - she doesn't need to.
She is real: well-intentioned and
sarcastic and funny and success-
ful, but like so many women out
there, struggling to find someone
drawn to that particular cock-
tail. It's the kind of character she
would actually be unable to por-
tray if it didn't strike so close to
home, epitomized by a juxtapo-
sition of two scenes: In the first,
Mindy is in her office, whining
over a Slurpee to her friend about
the debacle that is her love life.
When her secretary comes in
and announces a-patient in labor,
Mindy switches gears without a
second to spare on self-pity. "Oh
hell yes," she says, and she jumps
up to race to the hospital.
There's no shortage in the
media of female archetypes,
characters who we as young
women are supposed to see and
want to be. Kaling's article cites
"The Klutz" and "The Ethereal
Weirdo" (see also: a certain other
Fox Tuesday sitcom) among oth-
ers, but Mindy Lahiri isn't any
of those. She is us - the every-
day viewers, not the women
we are told to aspire to, but the
women we are. In that respect,
"The Mindy Project" is not only
delightful, but also realistic, and
Kaling, already in the ranks of
modern comedy legends, has
lived up to and beyond the hype.

night, where Light introduced
Michael Steinberg, the legal
director of the ACLU of Michi-
gan, to the group of nearly 40
students.
Steinberg said the ACLU of
Michigan created a website
titled "Student Voting Made
Easy," which encourages all
students in the state no mat-
ter their political affiliation to
start the voter registration pro-
cess online. .
At the meeting, Steinberg
emphasized the importance
of student participation in the
ACLU. '
"It's absolutely critical,"
he said. "These are forma-
tive years. Those who become
active when they are students
typically remain, active when
they graduate."
Light said he believes edu-
cating students on how to reg-
ister is an important aspect of
the voting process.
"It's just so important that
we are out helping students
on campus telling them that
they are able to vote and that
it's a very simple process if you
know what to do," he said.
- Along with encouraging
people to vote, Steinberg said
the ACLU hopes to protect
individual rights and civil lib-
erties of American citizens,
adding that the organization
prevents the United States
from becoming "a police state."
numbers ranging from 15,000 to
133,000 students.
Pollack also discussed the
University's participation with
Coursera at the University's
Board of Regents meeting on
Thursday, lauding the program
for its ability to connect with
users in innovative ways.
. "We think this is a very valu-
able and exciting way to connect
with our alumni, prospective
students and with the citizens
of the state," Pollack said after .
"And since I'm the budget per-
son, it provides potentially even
revenue, and we're really looking
into that."
In a Coursera course, students
watch recorded lectures on their
own time and pace, and have the
ability to skip through things
they don't want to watch and
slow down areas they want to
grasp more completely.
For Engineering Prof. J. Alex
Halderman, who teaches the
Securing Digital Democracy
Coursera class, the online teach-
ing experience has helped him
develop new course material and
improve his traditional lecture
practices.
"Someday, maybe you can go
to class having already watched
the core of the lecture at home
on your own time and you'd be
going to class and have a discus-
sion with the professor already
knowing the material," Halder-
man said.
Music, Theatre & Dance soph-
omore Chris Haddlesey, who is
taking the Fantasy and Science
Fiction: The Human Mind, Our
Modern World course taught by
English Prof. Eric Rabkin, said
the flexibility to engage with the
material when and how you want
to is appealing.

"Even though the course was
very demanding, it didn't require
you to get online at a certain
time," Haddlesey said. "It's very
flexible. When you felt like you
wanted to do work, you could."
Interactive quiz exercises,
exams or essays often accompany
the core video lecture. In Hal-,
derman's course, the program
interruptsthevideolectureinter-
mittently to present orte-question
quizzes, which he believes help
people stay focused and gives
him feedback on student compre-
hension of the material.
Rabkin's students hail from
every continent but Antarctica,
and include retired educators,
business professionals and high
school students. He said that
international students have even
created their own forums to dis-
cuss material in their native lan-
guage. Students who live near
each other have also arranged in-
person meetings to further their
knowledge of course material.
While Coursera has created
a wider audience for profes-
sors, Pollack explained that the
online format still lacks many of

"In many countries in this
world, you speak out against
the government, you're going
to be beat up, and nobody's
going to say a word about it,"
Steinberg said. "That's not the
vision of a country or world
that respects human rights and
dignity."
Steinberg said the group
focuses on hot-button issues
including affirmative action,
freedom of religion and gay
rights.
This year, Light said the
University chapter will con-
centrate specifically on priva-
cy, reproductive rights and free
speech and how these topics
influence students.
For this semester, how-
ever, the University chapter
will remained focused on the
upcoming election.
"If anything can come from
our work this semester, it's that
the voices of students are going
to be so important in this elec-
tion," Light said. "It doesn't
matterwho you're goingto vote
for. The fact that you're voting
and you're able to exercise your
civic duty is so important."
in words of advice to stu-
dents, Steinberg said their
involvement in democracy is
indicative of the future.
"You are the future of our
democracy," he said. "You are
the ones that are going to make
sure we live in a free country."
the qualities a live, on-campus
education can provide. She said
Coursera is great for "knowledge
transfer," but it still leaves a void
in other areas of the educational
experience, such as one-on-one
interaction with professors.
"You can have a really high
quality textbook and you can
read the textbook, but that's not
the same thing as going to col-
lege," Pollack said.
Still, Pollack said she feelsthat
the University and its professors
can use the Coursera platform
to supplement and enhance the
traditional in-class experience,
especially to foster more active,
engaged and hands-on learning.
Through his Coursera expe-
rience, Halderman said he is
starting to realize that the tra-
ditional classroom experience
will undergo inevitable change.
"I think there's still a lot we
have to figure out in terms of
how to use technology like this
in the classroom and how to use
it most effectively online on its
own, but I think the momen-
tum is here, and there's nongoing
back," he said.
In addition to making bet-
ter use of technology, there is
much to be decided about the
online courses regarding mon-
etization and establishment of
a credential system. While the
experience will remain free for
the foreseeable future, Pollack
acknowledged that Coursera
has begun to develop plans to
monetize its courses by selling
certificates of completion.
Business sophomore Ray
Batra, who took an introduc-
tory computer science course
through Stanford University
and a Health Policy and the
Affordable Care Act course

through the University of Penn-
sylvania, said he would like to
see the coursework transfer as
credit.
"(Awarding credit) would
entice people to take courses
more seriously and be more con-
sistent in doing things on time,"
Batra said.
Though Coursera has not
yet enforced a uniform policy
regarding credentials, some
professors have taken it upon
themselves to create their own
guidelines. Students in Prof.
Scott Page's course Model
Thinking were informed Mon-
day that in order to receive a
certificate for the course, they
must complete the quizzes and
exams with an average score of
70 percent.
This summer, the Univer-
sity formed faculty committee
was formed to develop poli-
cies about creating new online
courses. Pollack said the Uni-
versity will develop new cours-
es soon, though she is not sure
how many, as it will depend on
faculty interest and the business
model.

the volume," Winfield said. "So
the waits became worse, and the
satisfaction by undergraduates
became much worse."
While the appointment sys-
tem is still in its early phases,
Winfield said it takes six to
twelve months to get back up to
speed, and he is optimistic that
their objectives can be met.
"The ultimate goal is to get
the students in who need to be
seen right away, promptly, and
to have them have a quality,
delightful experience," Win-
field said. "Making changes
every few days to get it right
with the rapid cycle quality
improvement is getting closer to
getting it right. But I think that
it's going to take a good part of
the semester to really feel that
we got this under control."
The change to an appoint-
ment-only system is similar to
other Big Ten schools, including
University of Iowa and North-
western University, where simi-
lar'procedures are followed.
Winfield said the new system
will be more efficient because

cautions local officials when their
community is at risk of needing
an emergency manager.
"We're seeing the positive
benefit of that law today," Snyder
wrote. "And I believe it's very
good public policy. We strength-
ened the powers the emergency
manager would have so they
could come in, do their work, fin-
ish their work and get out and get
the community back in charge."
Ann Arbor City Councilmem-
her Sandi Smith (D-Ward 1), said
she opposes the policy because
she believes districts should be
autonomous from the state in
managing their governments,
particularly due to the discon-
nect that often occurs between
policymakers at different levels.
"Local communities still need
to be'ableto haVe their own pri-
orities in spending and some-
body who is assigned from the
state does not necessarily have
the same values as those people
that are within the community
and the elected officials that,
obviously, have been elected to
represent those people," Smith
said.
Thomas Ivacko, the program
manager for the research center
at the Ford School, said when
responses by officials who are
unfamiliar with the law are
excluded from the calculations,

the number of houses on cam-

 "Mathematically, there is a
spot for everyone to get a bid that
goes through the entire process,"
Raines said.
LSA sophomore Sarah Haddy
said the increase in participants
was noticeable, and had some
adverse effects on the recruit-
ment process.
Haddy dropped out of recruit-
ment during the first week
because she only got invitations
from two sororities that she had
little interest in.
"I could definitely tell that
there were a lot of girls," Haddy
said. "I would constantly go to
each house and we would talk
to some of the sorority girls ...
I could kind of tell that they
weren't really able to remember
me very well, because they were
talking to so many girls."

providers can pace themselves,
emphasizing that urgent walk-
ins will still be seen.
"You have to have the capac-
ity to see somebody who has a
terrible strep throat, has been
up all night vomiting, who has
an impossibly bad migraine -
they can't wait two or three
days," Winfield said. "Those
people have to be seen."
Despite UHS's emphasis on
increased patient satisfaction,
many students, like LSA soph-
omore Cassie Kooiker, have
expressed frustration with the
long wait between schedul-
ing an appointment and the
appointment itself.
"I was having a severe, unex-
plained pain in my jaw last week
and I came to make an appoint-
ment, but I guess it was serious
enough to let me see a nurse,"
Kooiker said. "I missed all of my
classes that day waiting to give
them my info, to see a nurse and
to get my vitals taken, and the
nurse resorted to WebMD to ask
me about my symptoms."
She added that she found
scheduling an appointment
through UHS to be more of a
burden than a help, and will
seek outside assistance in the
reported support increases from
38 percent to 47 percent and
reported opposition increases
from 30 percent to 32 percent.
"Those who are more
informed about it are going to
be able to give us more well-
grounded responses whether
they support or oppose different
aspects of the law," Ivacko said.
The survey also reported that
belief in effectiveness jumps
from 43 percent to 53 percent
when the opinions of officials
who know little about the law
are not considered.
Ivacko said the variance in
reports based on knowledge of
the policy is important to take
into account.
"That's a fairly sizable jump in
terms of support for the law and
views about its effectiveness,"
Ivacko said. "So among those
who feel really knowledgeable
about it, there's more support."
Ivacko said" the survey is
effective in capturing local lead-
ers' opinions on the contentious
topic.
"This law really gets at some
fundamental feelings about
democracy and so even if peo-
ple don't have a great detailed
understanding of the law, I think
just tapping into some of these
fundamental beliefs is still very
interesting," Iva4f, said.
Ivacko added that even though
the next Michigan Public Policy
poll will focus on a different
topic in a few weeks, the survey
In past rush seasons, it was
common for sororities to deco-
rate their houses in accordance
with a decided theme. This year,
deocrations were banned by
the Panhellenic council and its
member sororities.
Raines said the community-
wide decision was enacted to
ensure a "No Frills" style of
recruitment like that of other Big
Ten schools. She added that it

places a greater emphasis on the
personal interactions between
current members and potential
new members.
"It allows the focus of recruit-
ment to be more based on the
conversation that you're having
in the house rather than the girls
being overwhelmed with the
decorations," Raines said. "It also
saves the sororities the money
and time they had to put in deco-
rating and buying the decorations
and things like that in the past."
However, some students like
Haddy said the process of recruit-
ment was distracting enough, so
decorations would have helped
them remember each house bet-
ter.
LSA freshman' Erica Joseph
said she was able to remember
each house solely based on the

future.
"I plan on finding a family
doctor in the area for any issues
I may have in the future because
UHS was just too big of a has-
sle," Kooiker said.
However, Engineering senior
Curtis Reilly said he found the
switch to be. accommodating
after cutting his finger recently.
"I went to the nurse station
and had to wait for 20 minutes
because of the people in front of
me, but I got out of there within
one and half hours and (saw) the
doctor pretty fast," Reilly said.
Central Student Govern-
ment president Manish Parikh,
a Business senior, said CSG has
not received any complaints
about the new appointment sys-
tem, adding that it takes time for
new programs to run efficiently.
"Whenever a new system
is adopted, there are natu-
rally kinks along the way, but I
think UHS is responding well,"
Parikh said. "We remain firmly
committed to acting in the best
interests of our students and are
waiting to hear from them. UHS
has reiterated that they will be
sending out a survey to measure
the student response and we
will act accordingly."
team will most likely continue
to monitor and analyze opinions
on the emergency financial man-
ager policy.
"It's such an important topic,
both just about basic ques-
tions about democracy, but also
about the role, the relationship,
between state and local govern-
ments," Ivacko said. "The ques-
tion of home rule at the local
level versus state oversight - so,
so many issues (are) tied up in
this, I think we probably will
continue to track this in some
fashion."
Ivacko said a survey sent
out by CLOSUP in spring 2011
included few questions regard-
ing the act, as the law was very
new, but allowed researchers to
gather initial opinions from local
leaders about the law to contrast
with responses from the spring
2012 survey.
Results from the spring 2011
survey showed that 35 percent
of local government leaders
thought the act would be effec-
tive versus results from this
spring's survey, which stated
that 43 percent thought it is
be effective. Furthermore, last
year 23 percent of local officials
thought the law would be inef-
fective, versus a reported 19 per-
cent this year.
"(There is) kind of marginal
improvement in the view of local
leaders about the effectiveness
of the law over the course of the
last year," Ivacko said.
talks she had with the current
members.
"Personally speaking, I was
able to remember all of the hous-
es simply based on the conversa-
tions I had with individuals, as
well as the house itself," Joseph
said.
LSA senior Meaghan
O'Connor, a member of Alpha
Chi Omega sorority, said she sees
both sides of the decoration ban.

"I definitely remember as a
freshman when I rushed, I loved
going in and seeing all of the
decorations," O'Connor said. "I
think that was just part of this
magical experience that you
have, and it does make it easier to
differentiate houses in that way."
However, she said she thinks
the ban is appreciated by current
members who have toput ina lot
of time and effort into decorating
the houses.
"It's actually kind of refresh-
ing'and it's definitely made our
girls think a lot more about what
we have to do in terms of talking
to the girls to get them to like our
house," O'Connor said.

business," Wooten said.
Phil Deloria, the LSA associ-
ate dean for undergraduate edu-
cation, said though he has not
yet received the proposal, LSA
will consider the requirements
and standards set for the minor
to ensure they are parallel with
the curriculum set by other LSA
minors.
He added that LSA will
approach the proposal the same
way they would any other con-
centration or minor, and will be
open.to negotiate the terms if it
does not meet its standards.
"We trust our colleagues over
in Ross ...There could be some
negotiation, but I don't think I'd
anticipate that," Deloria said.
In order for students to pursue
a Business minor, the college they
are enrolled in must first approve
the proposal from the Business
school. Each college's decision
is independent and departments
can accept or reject the proposal
without affecting another col-
lege's ability to decide, Wooten
said.
Wooten said a task force com-
prised of students, faculty and
recruiters has been working for
about a year to conduct research
and develop a "rigorous core" for
the proposed minor. The group
also researched business minors
offered at other competitive uni-
versities and peer schools across
the nation.
If accepted by other colleges,
Wooten said the minor is sched-
uled to be integrated in the 2013-
14 academic year. To apply for
the minor, students will have to
submit an application consisting
of one or two short essay ques-
tions.
For the first year, only 100
students will be accepted until
the department can examine
the progress of the program and
determine how to proceed.

Classes for the 15 credit hour
minor will be taught in the
Business School by its faculty
members, Wooten said. While
accountingwillbe arequirement,
students will be able to choose
between finance and operations
management, management and
marketing, integrative strategy
class and action-based learning
classes.
Deloria speculated that the
minor will especially interest
students who feel they will ben-
efit from having a foundation in
business when looking for a job
after graduation.
However, he said LSA's con-
sideration of the program will be
based on what will best benefit
students.
"Business seems to be an
important thing to have in their
portfolio," Deloria said. "That
sentiment is not unanimously
shared across the college by
either the students or faculty,
but we also just want to have as
many options as possible for our
students. The bottom line for us
is always to think what's in the
best interest of our students."
Deloria added that LSA and
the other University colleges
have different teaching meth-
odologies. While LSA is more
focused on providing 'a broad
education and using compari-
sons, experiments and mod-
els, pre-professional schools
often organize teaching around
applying skills to specific case
studies.
"With a liberal arts degree,
what really matters is the 120
hours, the full range of think-
ing, the connective stuff across
those different domains that
trains your mind in a certain
kind of way," Deloria said. "To
have a minor as part of your LSA
120 hours, a minor in something
that's slightly different but
which is part of a bigger world
of thinking, (there's) nothing
wrong with that."
Wooten noted that the

minor's core classes are not
integrated with Ross students,
adding that the case studies
will also be more geared toward
Business minor students who
are focused on a diverse range
of non-business related topics,
including non-profits, govern-
ment relations, engineering and
sports management.
Ultimately, Wooten said the
Business school is looking for-
ward to seeing more students
taking business classes.
"We're excited that we can
offer a systematic education
experience for students who
want to complement their LSA
or Engineering or other school's
education," Wooten said. "It
extends the Ross brand."
LSA freshman Spencer Cher-
nus said he has been pre-admit-
ted to the Business School and
said he thinks introducing a
minor in business to other col-
leges at the University will be
beneficial to all students.
"I think it's an awesome idea
... it would do wonders for edu-
cation," Chernus said. "Every-
one should be exposed to a
business education as well as
liberal arts to some degree."
LSA freshman Derrick
Roldan said integrating the
learning styles of the Business
School with other programs can
enhance students' education by
introducing different learning
methods.
"It opens up different ways
of thinking, so those different
paths together would be a good
thing," Roldan said.
Engineering freshman Mark
McBride said the Business
minor could help students inthe
future when applying to jobs.
"Having a knowledge of busi-
ness in the engineering world
can help you land abetter job ina
company after school," McBride
said. "Business can relate to
everyone because when you're
out of school, business is every-
where."

Ryan's journey to Ann Arbor

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
A journey from Germany
to the United States, then to
Greece and finally to China
seems like a travel enthusiast's
dream. If you could imagine
that adventure, with numerous
stops in between, you may be
able to understand the career of
Greg Ryan.
Now the head coach of the
Michigan women's soccer team,
Ryan has lived coaching career
that has been an adventure, but
hardly a vacation.
Ryan was horn in Frankfurt,
Germany, but raised in Dallas.
Ever since he could walk, you
could count on him having a
soccer ball at his feet.
"Soccer has been my life, it's
what I love," Ryan said.
After an All-American career
at Southern Methodist Univer-
sity, Ryan rose to the profes-
sional ranks in 1978 with the
Minnesota Kicks of the North
American Soccer League. Ryan
played in the league for seven
years, retiring in 1985 as a mem-
ber of the Chicago Sting.
He took his first head coach-
ing job with the University
of Wisconsin women's soccer
team. By then, Ryan had gained
an array of soccer knowledge
from his professional days, but
he soon learned that being on
the sideline was much different
than playing on the field.
"I had a lot to learn about
coaching," Ryan said. "It was
my first time coaching women
and that was very different for
me. Honestly, I was maybe one
of the worst women's soccer
coaches."
Eventually, Ryan learned
what he hadto do to successfully
lead a women's soccer program,
winning NCAA Coach of the
Year in 1991, and he remained at
Wisconsin until 1993.
. "In coaching women, it is
very important in the way that
you relate to them," he said.
Ryan then returned to his
alma mater, where he led the
SMU women's team to a 37-21-
5 record during his tenure. He
then made one final stop, at Col-
orado College from 1999-2002,
leading the women's team to a

40-28-6 record, before taking a
break from collegiate soccer.
That same year, in 2002, Ryan
happily signed with the United
States women's national team
as an assistant coach. Jumping
from the collegiate ranks to the
best soccer players in the coun-
try was quite an adjustment, he
said.
"I was asked to become a
scout and then the assistant
coach," Ryan said. "Being
around the team, getting to
know the players, and getting
to know the level of play really
helped me. Especially scouting
in just about every continent, I
believe that prepared me very
well for the transition."
He was there through it all.
As an assistant coach, Ryan
attended the 2004 Olympics in
Athens. Under the USA's first-
ever female head coach, April
Heinrichs, Ryan helped lead the
team to a gold medal.
"It was so exciting to support
April," Ryan said. "This was her
first championship. When we
won, April jumped on top of me
and gave me a big hug. I was so
happy for her."
Heinrichs resigned from the

head coaching job in 2005, say-
ing it was the right time to step
away, and Ryan was hired as the
national team's head coach. Just
two years later, he was at the
2007 World Cup in China.
"When you're at a World
Cup as a coach, you're probably
busier during that time than any
other time during your career,"
Ryan said. "You just need to be
ready for your next opponent."
He nearly led the team to a
first-place finish in yet another
world competition. But the
team lost to Brazil, 4-0, in the
semifinals. It was the only loss
the U.S. suffered under Ryan's
tenure. Ryan was roundly criti-
cized for benching goalkeeper
Hope Solo in favor of veteran
Briana Scurry before the semi-
finals.
Although a third-place finish
may have been bittersweet, he
walked away from the tourna-
ment as an even better coach.
"When you play against
international teams, and even
in college, you run into a vari-
ety of styles of play," Ryan said.
"It helps you grow tactically,
knowing how to approach dif-
ferent teams."

That December, Ryan's con-
tract wasn't extended with the
national team, setting his stellar
45-1-9 record over three years
in stone.
After taking the head coach-'
ing position at Michigan nearly
five years ago, it's evident that
Ryan wasn't ready to take a
break from coaching.
"I feel so fortunate to do
something that I love," Ryan
said. "I get to work with young
people. It helps keep me young
(and) I've been very happy to be
a coach during all these years.
I plan on coaching until I'm six
feet under."
Ryan's career is nearlyunpar-
alleled to many of his colleagues
in the NCAA. It's obvious that
his experience as coach of the
national team reflects his suc-
cess at the collegiate level, but
it takes a different mindset to
coach at a university.
"You're more a part of their
lives. You're responsible for
more thap just winning but
more in terms of helping them,
whether it's injury, classes (or)
relationship issues," Ryan said.
"It's more personal at the colle-
giate level."

For theDaily
Until recently, James Mur-
phy, a freshman forward from
Oxford, England, has known a
football to be black, white, and
spherical.
In his hometown, Murphy
played five seasons for Read-
ing FC, a Premier League club,
before Michigan assistant soc-
cer coach Tommy McMenemy
paid him a visit early this past
summer. Having been recruited
by numerous American univer-
sities, including North Carolina,
Rutgers and Ohio State, Murphy
chose Michigan at the last min-
ute, signing with the men's soc-
cer program in June.
Murphy isn't the onlyEnglish-
man to make the trans-Atlantic
move to Michigan. He was joined
by freshman midfielder Luke
Coulson, a native of Manches-
ter, England. The duo has been
in Ann Arbor for training since
the beginning of August and has
seen plenty of action in the early
portion of the fall schedule.
The transitions - from Eng-
land to college life in the Unit-
ed States - have been difficult
Murphy said, but nothing too
overwhelming.
Murphy said early morn-
ing weight lifting sessions and

9 a.m. classes certainly take
some getting used to but "the
boys have been great" in helping
him adjust. He plans to major in
political science and has aspira-
tions to play Major League Soc-
cer after college.
Through the first seven games 4
of the season, the Wolverines
have matched up against a heavy
schedule that includes four ofthe
country's top-20 teams, posting
a 2-5 record. Of the team's "rocky
start," Murphy said experiences
like playing No. 5 South Florida
on the road in front of 3,000 fans
"definitely put the team in good
shape" for the season.
One highlight of the begin-
ning of his freshman year, away
from homework and soccer, was
packing into a crowd of 112,522
at Michigan Stadium on Sept. 15
to watch the .Michigan football
team defeat Air Force, 31-25, in
Murphy's first game at the Big
House.
"The only way to describe
the soccer culture back home is
to compare it to football here,"
Murphy said of the atmosphere
on game day.
And while he had abit of trou- 4
ble followingsome of the rules of
the sport, he said there will be
plenty of opportunities to learn
the other football over the next
four years at Michigan.
