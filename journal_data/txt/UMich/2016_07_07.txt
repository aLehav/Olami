County calls for EPA 
action on groundwater

‘U’ professor
wins grant 
of $500,000
for research 

LAURA MEYER/Daily

Ann Arbor Township Supervisor Michael Moran speaks at the Washtenaw County Board of Commisioners Wednesday 

City of Ann Arbor 

still undecided 
on superfund site 

position 

By BRIAN KUANG

Summer Daily News Editor

Citing 
more 
than 
three 

decades of disappointment with 
state environmental regulators, 
local authorities in Washtenaw 
County are increasing their 
support for the designation of a 
toxic plume of groundwater as 
an Environmental Protection 
Agency superfund site — a federal 
designation for areas in need 
of major clean up of harazdous 
substances. Such a move would 
prompt 
federal 
intervention 

that 
would 
largely 
bypass 

the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality, though 
other 
local 
officials 
have 

expressed 
reservations 
that 

doing so would merely hurt local 
property values and undermine 

the DEQ’s efforts.

Improper 
wastewater 

disposal by the Ann Arbor-
based company Gelman Sciences 
from 1966 to 1986 created a 
large plume of the carcinogenic 
toxin 1,4-dioxane underneath 
Ann Arbor, as well as Scio and 
Ann Arbor Townships. The 
gradually expanding plume has 
contaminated 
groundwater, 

forced the closure of more than 
100 private residential wells and 
is expected to reach the Huron 
River in the coming decades and 
potentially 
contaminate 
Ann 

Arbor’s water source at Barton 
Pond.

Wednesday 
evening, 
the 

Washtenaw 
County 
Board 

of 
Commissioners 
voted 

unanimously for a resolution 
supporting a petition to the 
EPA for superfund status. The 
Commission 
joins 
the 
Scio 

Township Board of Trustees, 
which voted in favor of a 
superfund petition June 20, and 
Ann Arbor Charter Township — 
a separate municipality from the 
city of Ann Arbor — that passed 

its own resolution of support in 
March.

Despite the outcome of the 

vote, the Ann Arbor City Council 
has not formally voted on a 
superfund petition, and Mayor 
Christopher Taylor — as well 
as several councilmembers — 
told the Daily in March that a 
premature petition could bring 
unintended harm to property 
values.

Wednesday, Taylor told the 

Daily the city is still unsure of 
whether or not it will back a 
petition for superfund status 
— though he didn’t rule out 
eventually supporting such a 
petition — and that he doesn’t 
expect City Council to debate 
the issue in the immediate 
future.

“The question of whether or 

not to seek superfund status 
is a complicated one,” Taylor 
said, pointing out that city 
staff members are continuing 
to work with other county 
stakeholders 
to 
understand 

the issue. “If we were to seek

The Rita Allen Foundation 

Scholars program — which invests 
in innovative biomedical research 
— 
recently 
awarded 
Monica 

Dus, 
University 
of 
Michigan 

progessor of of molecular, cellular 
and 
developmental 
biology 

$500,000 for her research on the 
relationship between sugar and 
the brain — an important factor in 
obseity research. 

The 
Foundation 
has 
been 

awarding candidates since 1976, 
requiring each to exhibit attention 
to innovation and global issues, 
focus on creating lasting solutions 
and a dedication to leadership. 
The grant has previously been 
awarded 
to 
professors 
and 

researchers nationwide, including 
those 
from 
Massachusetts 

Institute of Technology, Harvard 
University and the University of 
California system.

The grant will got toward Dus’ 

research on how the environment 
shapes one’s eating habits.

Dus’ grant began July 1, and she 

will receive a $100,000 payment 
annually over the next five years. 

Dus said the application process 

for the grant was extensive. Only 
a select number of universities 
can apply for the Rita Allen 
Foundation’s 
grants, 
which 

significantly reduces the pool 
of eligible candidates; however, 
Dus 
had 
to 
first

Clinton campaign
adds to higher ed 
affordability plan

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took pictures with churchgoers 
after speaking at the House of Prayer Missionary Baptist Church in Flint on 
February 7th.

New additions 

reflect collaboration 

with Sanders 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Summer Managing News Editor

Hillary 
Clinton’s 
campaign 

announced 
Wednesday 
three 

new features to her New College 
Compact plan, which aims to 
address the increasing student 
debt burden.

The 
announcement 
follows 

a private meeting last month 
between Clinton and her primary 
opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders 
(I–Vt.), in which they discussed 
the differing aspects of both 
candidates’ college affordability 
plans. 
Sanders 
touted 
free 

undergraduate 
tuition 
at 
all 

public institutions, which made 
the candidate popular among 
students.

Clinton’s 
plan, 
originally 

introduced in August, focuses 
on making college affordable by 
reducing the need for students 
to take out loans while also 
increasing financial aid from 
public institutions.

One 
addition 
to 
Clinton’s 

NCC borrows largely from the 
Sanders platform with promises 
to eliminate costs for middle class 
families by providing free tuition 
for those with an annual income 
of up to $125,000 at in-state 
institutions. According to a press 
release, this addition will cover 80 
percent of all families.

However, the plan requires an 

initial income threshold value 
of $85,000, which will then rise 
annually by $10,000 for four years.

Students for Sanders president 

Nicholas Kolenda, a rising LSA 
junior, said while Clinton’s new 
additions still do not go as far as 
Sanders’ plan, the new strides are 
an important merger beween the 
two campaigns.

“This isn’t completely tuition-

free college, technically, as it 
leaves out the top 10 percent,” he 
said. “Even though they can afford 
it, I’d like to see it be completely 
tuition-free and public. But it is 

tuition-free for a vast majority, 
so it’s a big improvement over 
Clinton’s original plan and a good 
compromise between the two 
plans.”

Despite 
this 
collaboration, 

Sanders has yet to officially 
endorse Clinton, despite stating 
that he plans to vote for her in 
November. 

College Democrats chair Collin 

Kelly, a rising LSA junior, said the 
expansion is an important addition 
to Clinton’s original efforts to 
address college affordability. 

“Secretary Clinton’s original 

college affordability plan would 
have gone a long way to alleviate 
some of the burden of student debt, 
and her updated plan improves 
it by responding to our needs 
with an even more progressive, 
accessible and extensive plan,” he 
said.

The second new aspect of the 

NCC is a moratorium on student 
debt, which Clinton plans to enact 
through an executive action at the 
start of her presidency. This three-
month period, in which federal 
borrowers would not have to issue 
payment installments, would give 
borrowers time to research all of 
their repayment options through 
the Department of Education 
to find the best options to save 
money.

The final addition furthers the 

protection of Pell Grants — federal 
aid for students with financial 
need — through restoring year-
round 
funding, 
which 
would 

help students pay for options 
like summer classes or other 
educational 
pursuits 
during 

summer months.

Kelly said the updated plan 

reflects the needs of students 
across 
the 
country, 
which 

he believes will help drive a 
Democratic victory in November.

“This shows that Democrats 

are hard at work to produce 
real, effective solutions to the 
challenges 
faced 
by 
students 

across the nation,” he said. “It’s 
clear which party listens to and 
supports the interests of students 
and 
young 
people. 
And 
we 

know that, when students vote, 
Democrats win.”

University set to open 
new treatment center
for psychiatric therapy

Students hold vigil to honor 
the victims of Istanbul attack

The facility will 

specialize in 

electroconvulsive 

treatment

By BAILEY TUCZAK

For the Daily

The University of Michigan Health 

System’s Department of Psychiatry 
is set to open a new treatment 
facility on Monday, July 11 under 
the supervision of Daniel Maixner, 
associate professor of psychiatry and 
director of the Electroconvulsive 
Therapy Program at the University. 
The space will be entirely dedicated 
to the practice of electroconvulsive 
therapy, a treatment created to relieve 
symptoms of patients with varying 
mental illnesses by means of brief, 
controlled seizures.

Once completed, the $3.6 million 

project will have transformed 9,500 
square feet of the old University 
Hospital south wing into an advanced 
treatment suite. What once held 
unused operating rooms will now be 
home to cutting-edge ECT.

According to Maixner, ECT use 

has 
been 
drastically 
increasing 

since the late 2000s, going from 
about 1,000 treatments to more 
than 2,000 treatments in the United 
States per year. However, its use has 
been limited in some states, with 
laws in place that require states to 
incorporate age guidelines and limits. 
In Texas, for example, children under 
the age of 16 are not allowed to receive 
ECT as a treatment method.

The University’s ECT program 

incorporates widespread treatment 
of all ages. Maixner said he does 
not mind the extra paperwork that 
accompanies this variety, because 
depression and mental illness know 
no age.

The move will make the ECT 

treatment more efficient since it 
will combine services that were 
previously separated between the 
first and ninth floor into one area. 
Maixner said this enclosed space 
will help ease the transition between 
rooms for patients, giving them the 
feeling of a more controlled, secure 
environment.

Maixner added that increasing 

the size of the ECT unit will also 
improve the patient experience, with 
quiet and comfortable surroundings 
targeting the specific needs of 
the facility’s patients. Individual 
interview rooms for pre- and post-
treatment care have also been added 
to the program, in which patients 
will complete comprehensive rating 
scales before and after ECT, as well 
as other questionnaires to determine 
the treatment’s success level.

The facility will also be tripling in 

size, which will allow the program to 
treat more than double the amount 
of patients as before, most of whom 
suffer from severe depression.

Maixner said many people with 

depression are reluctant to receive 
treatment, despite the prominence of 
the disease.

“The problem with depression 

is that a third or more of people can 
become 
resistant 
to 
treatment,” 

Maixner said. “So if there’s at any 
given time 15 or 20 million people that 
might have some form of depression 
in the U.S., a couple million people 
have some form of resistance to 
treatment.”

Maixner 
said 
ECT 
induces 

remission 
on 
a 
much 
higher 

percentage 
in 
comparison 
to 

medicine, and it also is an option for 
patients who have tried different 
types of medicine with no success.

“I always try to teach the young 

doctors and students that with 
medications, 
historically 
when 

they’re 
tested 
for 
outcomes 
in 

depression, they’re trying to prove 
that the drug will get you at least 50 
percent better,” he said. “But, you 
know, to me 50 percent better is not 
good enough. You wouldn’t want to 
be half way depressed, right? You just 
wouldn’t want to do that if you don’t 
have to.”

However, according to Maixner, 

one major drawback of ECT is the 
stigma with which it is associated. 
While the term “electroconvulsive 
therapy” may remind patients of 
psychiatric scenes in old movies, the 
doctors urge people not to be so quick 
on their judgments. Maixner said 
ECT has evolved into a safer, more 
trusted method of treatment through 
the decades, and many studies to 
ensure its safety.

LAURA/Daily

LSA Junior Humza Shaukat speaks at a candlelight vigil for the victims of an the airport attack in Istanbul on Thursday. 

Ceremony held 
in the Diag to 

remember lives lost

By ISHI MORI

Daily Staff Reporter

About 20 students gathered 

on the Diag Thursday evening 
to participate in a candlelight 
vigil for the victims of a 
terrorist attack on Turkey’s 
Istanbul Atatürk Airport this 
past week.

The 
attack 
occurred 

Tuesday, 
when 
three 
men 

opened fire in the airport 
— 
armed 
with 
guns 
and 

explosives — and dentonated 
their devices, killing a total 
of 44 people. No one has yet 
claimed responsibility for the 
assault, but the three have been 
linked to ISIS. 

The vigil was organized 

by 
the 
Muslim 
Student 

Association, which invited the 
Turkish Student Association 
to also participate. Many at 
the event wore red and white, 
the colors of Turkey’s national 
flag, to demonstrate solidarity 
with the victims and their 
families.

LSA senior Farhan Ali, a 

member of the MSA who led 
the event, said events like these 
are important because they 
show how victims and their 
families are not alone.

“It’s 
important 
to 

commemorate 
the 
lives 
of 

those who were lost through 
the hands of injustice,” Ali 
said. “Doesn’t matter if you’re 
Jewish, Christian, Muslim; I 
think it’s important to always 
say your prayers.”

The 
vigil 
began 
silently 

at about 8:30 p.m. Ali and 
Rackham student Ziah Dean 
led the group in prayer for 
the victims and offered their 
reactions to the attack.

Dean, a member of the 

Muslim 
Graduate 
Students 

Association, said he wanted 
to show through the vigil 
that there is still some good 
left in the world even though 
tragedies like the Istanbul 
airport attack happen often.

“There’s so much going on 

(in the world) that it’s hard to 
come together for every single 
instance in which (attacks) 
happen,” Dean said. “But the 
more often we come together 
(and) 
reflect 
the 
better, 

because it really brings us to 

our humanity of feeling each 
other’s pain even though they 
may be far away. For us to come 
together here and reflect on it 
is important just to remind us 
of the good that we have and 
just being thankful for what we 
have.”

LSA senior Ibtihal Makki, 

also a member of the MSA, 
echoed Dean’s sentiments of 
humanity and compassion.

“I like to come to events like 

these whenever I can,” she 
said. “I’m not Turkish or of 
Turkish descent, but I think it’s 
important to show solidarity 
with other people regardless 
of whether you identify with 
them.”

Rackham alum Selin Nurgun, 

who has family in Turkey, said 
vigils like these give people the 
hope that lets them move on.

“I think it’s important to 

realize that you’re not alone 
because sometimes you can 
be hunkered down by fear and 
sadness, and you can get it 
inside your head and think that 
the world is an awful place,” 
she said. “But when you step 
out of that and come and see 
support and see friendly faces 
of all different shades of the 
world, it’s comforting.”


A

ll throughout elementary 
and middle school, I was 
taught the value of equality 

was of utmost 
importance. 
My classmates 
and 
I 
were 

taught 
that 

we must “treat everyone the way 
that we would like to be treated,” 
the Dr. Seuss mantra “a person’s 
a person, no matter how small” 
and the prevalent belief that “we 
are all one.” In my opinion, this 
is good advice to give young kids. 
Informing children that all people 
deserve respect — no matter how 
different they appear to be from 
you — attempts to teach them not 
to stereotype one another. But as I 
matured into an adult, the morals 
and values that I was taught didn’t 
mature along with me, and these 
“we are all one” morals often 
remained in my mind, as the simple 
and limited way they were taught 
by my kindergarten teacher. 

The horrific Orlando shootings 

that occurred this past June 
during Pride Month were followed 
a few weeks later by the Twitter 
hashtag 
#HeterosexualPrideDay. 

Created in an effort to celebrate 
heterosexuality, 
Heterosexual 

Pride Day was disrespectful to 
those who have been discriminated 
against based on their sexual 
orientation and was also incredibly 
useless, 
as 
heterosexuality, 
as 

least in America, has never been 
something one couldn’t be proud 
of. In the same vein, movements 
like All Lives Matter and Men’s 
Rights Activism are all created out 
of a false understanding of what 

ostracism actually is. But, many 
argue, “If we are ‘all one,’ then 
why can’t I as a cis/abled/straight/
white/Christian/man celebrate my 
identities?” Indeed, why is pride 
in privileged identities so looked 
down upon?

Those who decide to take pride 

in privileged identities seem to 
have a basic misunderstanding of 
what pride is and why it exists. 
Perhaps for someone from a 
privileged identity, pride appears 
to be exclusive and clique-y, a 
movement meant to exclude others 
who don’t share the said identity. 
But this ignores how, for those 
whose identities make them a 
target, celebrating these identities 
is, in itself, a rebellion. For those 
who identify as LGBTQ, taking 
part in the events during Pride 
Month means finally being able to 
celebrate an identity that has most 
likely put them at risk of bullying, 
harassment and even losing their 
jobs or housing. The same goes 
for taking part in pro-Black, pro-
Muslim, or any pro-movement of 
a minimized identity. The reason 
these holidays and movements exist 
at all is in response to the prevalent 
beliefs that seek to destroy them. 
These holidays and movements 
weren’t created to exclude anyone 
else — they were created so that 
these identities could continue to 
exist.

Privilege is hard to confront, 

I understand. As Americans, we 
are all taught that success comes 
to those who work hard and try 
their best. So, if you live a life that 
is relatively easy, it is comforting 
to think that this is the result of 

you or your ancestors’ hard work, 
and that a painless lifestyle is your 
reward. It’s hard to confront the 
fact that everything you have, that 
everything your family has, could 
also be the result of luck as well as 
a strong will and determination. 
Sometimes it is hard for us to 
confront our privilege because of 
the struggles that we have faced 
in our lifetimes — if someone has 
grown up impoverished, it may 
be hard for them to realize they 
might have a type of privilege that, 
nevertheless, makes life easier for 
them than it would be for someone 
else. I understand and I sympathize, 
but we have to do better.

Many of us have been taught 

that “a person’s a person, no matter 
how small,” and “we are all the 
same,” but this basic understanding 
of humanity often offers us a 
distorted view of how the world 
actually works. If we are to assume 
that “we are all the same,” it is 
difficult for the privileged to accept 
that someone may be experiencing 
life in a different, harder way. It is, 
perhaps, this lack of understanding 
that may lead some to believe that, if 
a few identities are allowed to have 
their own history months or Pride 
Month, they are also deserving 
of this kind of treatment. Those 
with privilege need to realize that 
our identities — which we never 
have to think or worry about — do 
not need to be celebrated and do 
not need to be honored. We need 
to stop assuming that everyone’s 
experience has been the same.

Learning from Twitter
F

eminism 
is 
a 
complex 

issue that fundamentally 
deals with dynamics and 

relationships 
between 
women, 
men, 

society, 
race, 

class, politics, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, 
ability and a whole host of other 
large, abstract ideas. Feminism 
is far from new, but since around 
2014, “culture (has) become a 
feminist issue.” That was the year 
of Beyoncé’s iconic 2014 Video 
Music Awards performance. The 
Internet, 
especially 
Twitter, 

exploded 
with 
activity 
and 

excitement following Queen Bey’s 
display of empowerment.

Apart 
from 
Beyoncé’s 

performance, 
we’ve 
seen 
UN 

Women’s 
2014 
social 
media 

campaign 
#HeForShe, 
which 

encouraged men to take up the 
issue of gender parity and state 
their position as allies for women. 
We saw #YesAllWomen arise 
in 2014 to uncover the issues of 
daily 
oppression. 
We’ve 
seen 

#EqualPayDay in 2016 discuss 
the gendered wage gap. We saw 
#CarryThatWeight 
arise 
in 

2014 in response to the epidemic 
of mishandled campus sexual 
assaults. We’ve seen the disgusted 
response to the abysmally lax June 
sentencing of a violent rapist who 
attended Stanford.

Everyone 
on 
Twitter 
gets 

140 
characters 
to 
declare 

whatever they want, virtually 
uncensored. All you need to 
participate is Internet access. 
The issues discussed on Twitter, 
however, 
often 
reflect 
those 

important to privileged feminists. 
Problems 
faced 
by 
educated, 

middle- or upper-class, straight, 
white women often gain more 
attention 
than 
the 
issues 
of 

less wealthy women, women of 
color, transgender women, non-
heterosexual women, etc. The 
mainstream dialogue on Twitter, 
consolidated in its trending topics, 
doesn’t always necessarily embody 
intersectionality, 
especially 

the issues of women who share 
membership in other minority or 

oppressed groups.

This is especially concerning 

because 
Twitter 
trends 
are 

designed at their core to inform the 
user base about important topics 
by broadening their horizons to 
see what others are discussing. If 
trends are biased, as they so often 
are, towards the privileged, then a 
cycle of focusing only on the issues 
discussed by certain powerful 
groups of people will perpetuate. 
And this will occur despite the 
strong communities speaking out 
on alternative and more honest 
realities. But social media can 
work against this honesty by 
inducing a groupthink, tunnel-
vision mentality. Sifting through 
users to find diverse content is 
definitely 
possible. 
However, 

this is simply another barrier to 
an otherwise open, equalizing 
platform for free speech and 
understanding. Younger people 
are the demographic of social 
media sites, and if they are 
exposed only to one wave of 
feminist discourse because of 
these barriers, they will face 
the often invisible problem of 
ignorance.

Twitter is simply the starting 

point. It allows me to listen to 
women speaking directly and 
honestly about their lives, and I 
am grateful that it had a role in 
changing me from a relatively 
uninformed girl into someone 
who can learn from women 
experiencing life differently than 
I do. It is exciting to participate 
in #Hashtag Feminism, but it is 
important to not become simply 
a product of a fledgling wave of 
feminism, one that developed out 
of hashtags and campaigns, one 
that is wide-reaching and with the 
potential for an engaging and well-
rounded discourse but still falls 
short in terms of representation. 
If your goal is to learn from social 
media, it is important to follow 
people who do not share all of your 
experiences. It is important to not 
only embrace but also actively 
seek intersectionality.

A 

few days ago, I came 
across an op-ed in The 
New York Times, “Angry 

Tweets Won’t 
Help 
African 

Lions,” where 
the 
author, 

Richard 
Conniff, 
implores 
people to do more than just 
tweet angrily about issues they 
care about. Last year, as Conniff 
pointed out, when Zimbabwe’s 
prized lion, Cecil, was shot by a 
Minnesota dentist, organizations 
condemned 
the 
doctor 
and 

people took to social media, 
expressing 
outrage 
over 
the 

lion’s killing and the larger issue 
of “trophy hunting” — selectively 
hunting game and often keeping 
parts of the animal as a trophy. 
Conniff emphasizes that simply 
expressing anger and frustration 
over an issue is not enough.

And he is right. We need to 

do more than express anger 
through tweets or simply show 
solidarity 
through 
changing 

our profile pictures. But those 
are places to start, and we’d do 
well to encourage it and suggest 
more ways to help. It is time 
that we embrace the power of 
social media and use it. Just as 
words aren’t enough alone to 
change a situation, criticizing 
those who are trying to help a 
cause stops short of the real issue 
surrounding social justice. We 
should be saying: This is great, 
and we want more. Though I 
do not love certain aspects of 
social media, there is no question 
that it is powerful. News and 
information are traveling faster 
than ever before through these 
channels. I find out about events 
and read articles I wouldn’t 
have if they hadn’t popped up 
on Facebook and other forms of 
social media.

So, 
instead 
of 
criticizing 

people for changing their profile 
pictures to show their solidarity 
with France or for tweeting their 
anger about the killing of Cecil 

the Lion, we must acknowledge 
that these things are a start and 
then encourage people to take 
these steps further and use social 
media to share donation links, 
important petitions and articles. 
While we could be critical of 
social media all the time, there 
are ways in which we could 
utilize social media to progress 
dialogue about issues of social 
justice and to enact change, 
which is a crucial missing part of 
our dialogue.

Despite the ways that social 

media has changed our private 
lives and our relationships with 
friends and family, it can help 
spread the word about important 
causes and issues. As television 
and news stories focused the 
nation’s 
attention 
to 
police 

brutality against demonstrators 
during the civil rights movement 
in the ‘50s and ‘60s, today, 
images and stories shared over 
social media focus our attention 
on many causes, shining the 
spotlight 
on 
something 
that 

might otherwise be lost. Words 
can be a powerful way to begin a 
discussion.

Spending 
too 
much 
time 

dwelling on past times, and 
wishing 
away 
Facebook, 

Instagram and Twitter won’t 
do us any good. By the first 
few months of 2016, Facebook 
had 1.65 billion active monthly 
users, almost 20 percent of 
the 
world’s 
population. 
As 

of June 2016, there were 500 
million 
monthly 
Instagram 

users. Whether or not I am 
always happy with how these 

platforms have changed and 
shaped our society, social media 
is here now, and it would be in 
our best interest to work with 
these platforms and not against 
them. Furthermore, to reach 
the millennial generation and 
generations to come, which will 
be born in the age of rapidly 
expanding technology, we have 
to 
adjust 
and 
acknowledge 

social media’s large presence.

It’s time that we change our 

tune. I agree that throwing out 
a tweet about a recent tragedy 
or something we see as unjust 
isn’t where we should stop, 
but it does no good to brush 
someone aside because you 
don’t think they are doing 
enough. That can only shut 
down the conversation. There 
are so many issues that I want 
to help address, but I can often 
feel overwhelmed. Where do 
I start? How can I help? By 
bringing the conversation to 
mediums such as Facebook, it 
can help a big task feel more 
achievable, giving me more 
confidence that I can help make 
a change.

Conniff mentions in his piece 

that we need organizations, 
such as the United Nations, 
the 
European 
Union, 
etc., 

to put money toward causes 
such 
as 
saving 
endangered 

species. I agree, but one way 
we can go about achieving 
this 
goal 
is 
disseminating 

information and spreading the 
word through social media. 
And, 
who 
knows? 
Angry 

tweets could help jumpstart an 
important movement because, 
once issues begin to appear on 
social media, it helps put the 
issue on the world stage, raise 
awareness and fuel action to 
create legislation to address 
these issues. Instead of being 
critical and telling people they 
aren’t doing enough, we need to 
encourage them to do more.

POLUMBO-
LEVY

Two different Michigans
A 

Thrillist 
article 
from 

more than a year ago 
claiming that Michigan 

is 
the 
best 

state 
has 

reemerged 
and is being 
shared 
quite a bit on Facebook. The 
justification centers on tourism, 
boasting 
the 
rising 
brewing 

industry, the seemingly endless 
shorelines and the beauty of the 
Upper Peninsula. The article 
even guides readers unfamiliar 
with Michigan to “listen to the 
dulcet tones of Michigan tourism 
pitchman Tim Allen.”

As 
important 
as 
tourism 

is to the state of Michigan, I 
don’t think it’s fair to evaluate 
Michigan 
exclusively 
on 
its 

tourist attractions. Seeing such 
positive attitudes toward the 
state brings me joy. But I worry 
that by focusing on the positive 
aspects of Michigan, we will 
forget 
the 
negative 
aspects 

that cripple the lives of many 
poor communities. Michigan’s 
setbacks need to remain at the 
forefront of the discussion until 
we can begin to correct them.

We 
can’t 
overlook 
that 

Detroit and Flint both fall in 
the top three most dangerous 
cities in America. While parts 
of Detroit still carry the city’s 
rich history, and Midtown and 
Downtown continue to grow 
and develop, the school district 
and neighborhoods in the city 
are still falling apart. The city’s 
unemployment rate is still nearly 
10 percent, more than double the 
statewide and national rates of 
4.7 percent.

To 
make 
matters 
worse, 

Metro Detroit has the highest 
concentrated poverty rate of the 
top 25 metro areas in the country. 
The term “working poor” applies 
especially well to the area, as 
many of the impoverished people 
have jobs.

Urban poverty isn’t the only 

problem Michigan faces, as rural 
poverty is also a serious ailment 
plaguing the state. Eleven of the 
poorest counties in the state 
of Michigan are rural. Often 
referred to as the hidden poor, 
rural communities with high 
poverty rates often go unnoticed 
mainly because of their isolation 
from metropolises. Additionally, 
these rural communities are 
often the places suburbanites 

build 
their 
summer 
homes, 

pushing 
poor 
populations 

further into the shadows of 
beautiful lake houses and cabins.

Spending most of their time 

in Ann Arbor, I think many 
Michigan students, through no 
fault of their own, become blind 
to the economic struggles many 
residents 
in 
Michigan 
face. 

When we venture to Detroit, 
we visit downtown and take the 
expressway back to Ann Arbor. 
We see what tourists see when 
they visit Detroit: the bustling, 
gentrified areas of downtown 
where abandoned houses and 
crumbling schools are out of 
sight. We often miss the bigger 
picture, 
and 
consequently 

struggle to grasp the legitimate 
concerns that face the city and 
many parts of the state.

As a lifelong resident of the 

state of Michigan, I love the 
state I call home. I can’t wait to 
visit the microbreweries in my 
hometown when I turn 21. I love 
heading downtown to watch a 
Red Wings game. I can’t complain 
about the miles of sandy beaches 
that guard the outside of both 
peninsulas, either.

However, the aforementioned 

features are, as the Thrillist 
article indicates, major tourist 
attractions. Though tourism is 
a huge part of Michigan life, it 
is not the main part. Michigan’s 
endless shorline is not a valid 
excuse to ignore the economic 
problems that plague rural and 
urban regions of the state.

Perhaps these problems will 

be fixed over time, but, until they 
are, Michigan will remain home 
to two vastly different realities: 
one where craft beers, endless 
beaches and majestic wildlife 
are the main focus, and another 
reality where poverty and lack 
of economic growth are the 
dominating features. Celebrating 
Michigan’s 
vibrant 
tourism 

culture 
is 
understandable, 

but even in the midst of our 
celebration, we cannot overlook 
the significant setbacks many 
communities face. We may not 
have immediate solutions to 
these problems, and that is fine. 
But, until progress is made, the 
economic struggles that hurt 
poor communities cannot escape 
our evaluations of the state.

FILM REVIEW

Hawthorne has 
prodigal return

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

The audience — a mix of 

students here for the summer, 
townies and adults in their 50s 
and 60s — looked like they would 
have been at home at a Beethoven 
showcase. The Power Center is 
also a venue better suited for 
polite, 
muted 
applause 
than 

raucous crowds and wild dancing. 
Yet 
Mayer 
Hawthorne, 
Ann 

Arbor’s homegrown neo-soul star, 
whipped his polite, well-behaved 
audience into shape. By the end 
of the singer’s well-timed concert 
and 
enthusiastic 
encore, 
the 

crowd was swaying and dancing to 
Hawthorne’s pulsating, buoyant 
hits.

This 
concert 
marked 

a 
watershed 
moment 
in 

Hawthorne’s music career — it’s 
the first time he’s performed a 
mainstage, ticketed event in Ann 
Arbor. Earlier events, such as his 
hugely successful Sonic Lunch 
concert in the Michigan Theater 
several years ago, saw a full house, 
but no tickets were needed for the 
free concert. He has performed 
countless times in town and 
has a strong support base, but 
some wondered how much fans 
would shill out to see an act they 
previously enjoyed for free.

Luckily for Hawthorne, plenty 

made the leap to the ticketed 
event to show their support. After 
a brief DJ opener, Hawthorne and 
his band struck their signature 
poses and leapt right into the first 
syncopated number.

“It’s good to be back home,” 

Hawthorne said.

He kept the small talk to a 

minimum, packing in as many 

songs as possible. Though, he did 
take time to reflect on how far he’s 
come, remarking that he couldn’t 
believe he was on the Power 
Center stage after seeing concert 
after concert there growing up.

Hawthorne performed a steady 

mix of new and old hits, which 
half the audience could and did 
sing along to, as well as a few 
unexpected covers. His signature 
style suited his updated music 
well: a slim suit and tilted fedora 

were exchanged for a gold lamé 
blazer and matching kicks halfway 
through the show.

He’s a diva — is there a male 

equivalent of diva? — in the best 
sense of the word. He’s surrounded 
himself with an extremely talented 
band, with beats, backup and 
on-point dance moves. With them, 
he’s gracious with the spotlight, 
directing plenty of attention to 
their individual talents as well.

Years 
ago, 
Hawthorne 
got 

himself a stage name, assumed his 
suave, worldly stage persona and 
started making music here in Ann 
Arbor. Timed to coincide with 
the release of his fourth studio 
album, this tour featured the best 
of his smooth, upbeat crooning. 
The woman in Hawthorne’s hit 
song “The Walk” may walk her 
“high heels right out of my life,” 
but here’s hoping that the singer 
doesn’t walk out of our lives 
anytime soon.

‘The BFG’ wonderous 
despite thematic issues

Legendary director’s 
latest packs strong 

visual punch

By DANNY HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

“The witching hour, somebody 

had once whispered to her, was a 
special moment in the middle of 
the night when 
every 
child 

and 
every 

grown-up 
was in a deep, 
deep 
sleep, 

and 
all 
the 

dark 
things 

came out from 
hiding and had 
the world to themselves.”

Anyone who has read Roald 

Dahl’s 1982 classic children’s 
novel “The BFG” knows the 
quiet moments of the witching 
hour are magical enough to awe 
both the youthful and the aged. 
Dreams, fed through a trumpet 
from the titular big friendly 
giant to the people of London, 
can amaze, stun, terrify and 
stupefy.

Legendary 
director 
Steven 

Spielberg’s latest, an adaptation 
of Roald Dahl’s novel, written by 
the late Melissa Mathison (“E.T. 
the 
Extra-Terrestrial”), 
is 
a 

return to the fantastical films of 
his past. From “E.T.” and “Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind” 
to the later, more maligned 
“Hook” and “A.I.,” Spielberg 
has continued to construct a 
universe of realized childhood 
dreams, 
with 
marvelous 

characters and stunning visual 
imagery to match.

“The BFG” follows that big 

friendly giant (Mark Rylance, 
“Bridge of Spies”) and a small 
girl named Sophie (newcomer 
Ruby 
Barnhill), 
whom 
he 

snatched up from her orphanage, 
as they try to stop the other 
man-eating giants from eating 
innocent people. It’s the latest 
in the canon of Spielberg special 
effects films, and it knocks the 
others out of the park — visually, 
at least. From the first shots 
of the BFG weaving through 

the cobblestone streetscape of 
London in the early morning 
hours, turning on a dime to 
hide from pedestrians and cars, 
the careful choreography of 
the film is clear: whoever is 
responsible for the film’s visual 
effects should be lauded heavily. 
Perhaps the most stellar example 
is a captivating dream-catching 
sequence in the shadows of a 
mythical tree laden with floating 
specks of dream stuff. The magic 
doesn’t 
stop 
at 
grandiosity: 

in between the scenes of the 
massive world around Sophie, 
some of the film’s most heartfelt 
moments come in the intimate 
shots, close ups on her and the 
giant.

The 
performances, 
for 

the 
most 
part, 
are 
equally 

extraordinary. 
Rylance, 

transformed into a giant through 
motion capture technology, acts 
with genuine warmth. He acts 
through the technology, not 
despite it; every eye movement 
or nervous smile feels so true. 
The other giants, led by The 
Fleshlumpeater (the wickedly 
funny Jemaine Clement, “Flight 
of the Conchords”) are a bit more 
cartoonish, but it’s forgivable, 
like their wildly rambunctious 
fits. Meanwhile, on the formal 
end of the film, the Queen 
(Penelope 
Wilton, 
“Downton 

Abbey”) and her maid (the 
always underrated Rebecca Hall, 
“Frost/Nixon”) and butler (Rafe 
Spall, “The Big Short”) are prim 
and proper, exuding a regality 
that 
borders 
on 
excessive, 

heavily contrasting the savage 
life of the giants with the orderly 
customs of Buckingham Palace.

In the middle is Sophie, our 

protagonist. Barnhill embodies 
the archetypal young Spielberg 
character 
— 
precocious 
yet 

perpetually in awe of what she 
purports to already know. While 
Spielberg has an incredible track 
record of coaching wonderful 
performances out of young kids, 
somehow Barnhill just doesn’t 
live up to expectations. Her voice 
is showy (think Veruca Salt in 
“Willy Wonka and the Chocolate 
Factory”) and her words are 
obvious 
exposition. 
Dialogue 

flows unnaturally as if she was 
specifically cued to say each line.

Thankfully, where the writing 

may falter, Spielberg’s regular 
below-the-line trio of composer 
John Williams, editor Michael 
Kahn 
and 
cinematographer 

Janusz 
Kamiński 
realize 

Spielberg’s 
cinematic 
vision. 

Williams’s music swells at just 
the 
right 
moments, 
sucking 

the audience into his regular 
partner’s world. Kahn keeps 
the film moving quickly, but is 
able to linger on the moments 
that 
really 
count. 
Kamiński 

expertly navigates around the 
complications 
motion-capture 

may pose as he follows Sophie to 
assure us it’s her story.

Spielberg has been consistently 

crafting 
masterpieces 
since 

1975’s “Jaws” literally invented 
the blockbuster. Of his now 
thirty movies, at least a full third 
could 
be 
considered 
perfect 

films. Though “The BFG” doesn’t 
match the genius of some of his 
prior efforts, there’s enough here 
to satisfy fans. While Spielberg’s 
grasp on the film-going audience 
may be flickering, the moments 
of brilliance are still there, as 
strong as ever.

Blood Orange’s latest 
a sharp commentary

MUSIC REVIEW

“Freetown Sound” is a 
mix of eclectic sounds 

and messages

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

30-year-old British multi-instru-

mentalist Dev Hynes may not be the 
most well-known musician, but his 
status as a sing-
er, songwriter 
and producer 
makes him one 
of the most 
talented hidden 
gems working 
in the industry 
today. From 
playing for 
2000s dance-
punk band Test Icicles to going 
solo under the moniker Lightspeed 
Champion (now changed to Blood 
Orange), Hynes has written and 
produced songs for Sky Ferreira, 
Carly Rae Jepsen, Solange Knowles, 
FKA Twigs and Florence and The 
Machine. Other than his expertise 
in music production, what makes 
Hynes such a skilled musician is 
his drive to push against both sonic 
and thematic boundaries, making 
music that challenges the status 
quo. This fearless passion fueled his 
acclaimed 2013 sophomore effort 
Cupid Deluxe and his newest album 
as Blood Orange, Freetown Sound, 
propels Hynes even further into 
groundbreaking territory.

Like other great concept albums, 

Freetown Sound is a record as 
personally relevant as it is socially 
conscious, incorporating both uni-
versality and specificity. On the one 
hand, the album’s core influence 
stems from Hynes’s connection 
to his father, whose hometown of 
Freetown, Sierra Leone appears 
in the title. But, even more so, the 
record is a celebration of difference, 
identity and cultural unity, particu-
larly that of Black and queer pride. 
According to a recent Instagram 
post, Hynes dedicated this album 
to “everyone told they’re not Black 
enough, too Black, too queer, not 
queer the right way.” 

While Freetown Sound is cer-

tainly long (its 17 tracks stretch 
to about an hour), listening to 
the whole album song-by-song 
is a gratifying and mesmerizing 
experience. Freetown benefits not 
only from Hynes’ breathy vocals 
and gifted songwriting, but also 
from the album’s eclectic fusion 
of soul, hip hop, jazz, New Wave, 
calypso and pop. Throughout the 
record, Hynes successfully imbues 
his own worldview into the woozy 
rhythms, powerful lyrics and suit-
able samples of each track. Tropical 
standouts “Augustine” and “Best 
to You” find Hynes channeling dif-
ferent sides of his personality, the 
former embracing his African heri-
tage and the latter embracing that of 
a lover. “Hands Up” is a catchy yet 
unnerving anthem that spotlights 
the #BlackLivesMatter movement, 
with Hynes recognizing the victim-
ization of young Black kids in the 
song’s chorus (“Keep your hood off 
when you’re walking ‘cause they 
/ Hands up, get up, hands up, get 
up”). The song also acts as a com-
panion piece to the slightly superior 
“Sandra’s Smile,” a dizzying, synth-
heavy, Sandra Bland-referencing 
tune Hynes released back in 2015 
as a non-album single. However, 
when Hynes isn’t political, he softly 
and beautifully sings of unrequited 
love, heartbreak and loneliness on 
woeful tunes “With Him,” “Squash 
Squash” and “Better Than Me.”

In addition to being an album 

that encompasses creative expres-
sion, Freetown Sound is an intensely 
collaborative record, the majority of 
those collaborators being women. 
Though the artists helping Hynes 
go uncredited, they heighten Free-
town Sound’s already incredible 
foundation, as well as highlight the 

album’s feminist overtones. The 
impressive list includes Blondie lead 
singer Debbie Harry on “E.V.P.,” 
Zuri Marley on “Love Ya,” Carly 
Rae Jepsen on “Better Than Me,” 
Nelly Furtado (yes, the Nelly Furta-
do) on “Hadron Collider,” Empress 
Of’s Lorely Rodriguez on “Best to 
You” and New York-based singer 
Ava Raiin providing background 
vocals on multiple tracks. Hynes 
also samples Atlanta slam poet 
Ashlee Haze’s “For Colored Girls” 
on the fierce opener “By Ourselves,” 
where she praises rapper Missy 
Elliott and acknowledges the sig-
nificance of representation of Black 
women in the media.

Freetown Sound is to Hynes what 

Lemonade is to Beyoncé, To Pimp 
a Butterfly is to Kendrick Lamar, 
and Black Messiah is to D’Angelo. 
The album is not only a compelling, 
kaleidoscopic record with personal 
and political undertones, but also 
a powerfully evocative mosaic of 
thought-provoking themes and 
messages that blend together almost 
effortlessly. Freetown Sound is a 
triumph for Hynes, especially as 
it effectively conveys the singer/
songwriter’s struggle to find a place 
to call his home. He was born in 
London and lives in New York City, 
but Hynes goes even deeper by illu-
minating his Freetown roots. Just 
as important is Hynes’s ability to 
speak, write and sing about some of 
the most topical issues of today. In 
light of ongoing police brutality tar-
geting Black people and the recent 
tragic shooting at a gay nightclub in 
Orlando, Freetown Sound is not just 
a tribute to these oppressed groups, 
but also a stark reminder that we 
cannot ignore the harsh realities 
that surround us every day.

“Insert artsy fartsy quote here.”

‘Love’ this book

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Hardly a week goes by without 

an article popping up on Facebook 
or Twitter analyzing the current 
situation regarding the love lives 
— or lack thereof — of millenni-
als. 
“They’re 

doomed,” the 
critics always 
seem to sob. 
“All they do 
now is hook-
up.”

“Romance 

is dead” has 
become a bat-
tle cry, though 
what war we’re fighting is still 
unclear. Some blame technology, 
some blame party or hookup cul-
ture, some blame feminism — the 
list continues, each reason more 
ridiculous than the last.

Moira Weigel’s “Labor of Love: 

the Invention of Dating” traces the 
idea that romance has sputtered 
out through history, mapping out 
where and how courtship and dat-
ing started and how it has evolved 
over time. She reveals how people 
have always been worried — dat-
ing has, in fact, died several times. 
And people have never not been 
preoccupied with marriage; she 
concludes her introduction with 
a shrewd observation that may 
alarm students stressing about the 
intersection of careers and rela-
tionships.

“If marriage is the long-term 

contract that many daters still hope 
to land, dating itself often feels like 
the worst, most precarious form 
of contemporary labor: an unpaid 
internship,” Weigel writes. “You 
cannot be sure where things are 
heading, but you try to gain experi-
ence. If you look sharp, you might 
get a free lunch.”

Weigel’s style is blunt; she lands 

her points neatly, the emphasis 
always hitting home where it needs 
to. Dating customs change as the 
economy changes; privacy is a 
recent invention; dating has always 
seemed to be “work for women and 
recreation for men;” beauty is cur-
rency for women; gay bars preced-
ed single bars for straights. “Labor 
of Love” is a quick and informative 
read that makes it easy for read-
ers to retain the information after 
they’ve finished.

Weigel highlights how customs 

and traditions that seem routine 
and normal to us now would be 

shockingly inappropriate in the 
past, but it also shows how the 
opposite is true. Parents and other 
people have always been worried 
about the sexual promiscuity of 
college kids. Before there was DTR-
ing (defining the relationship), 
there was going steady, and, before 
there was going steady, there was 
calling (the kind without phones). 
Before there was hooking up, there 
was necking, and, before there was 
necking, there was petting.

In other words, teenagers have 

always been misbehaving in the 
eyes of their elders. Who knew?

Weigel does a fantastic job of 

exploring dating and relationships 
with a lens towards class differ-
ences, inviting readers to consider 
fresh perspectives as to why we 
value the institution of marriage 
the way we do and to learn about 
the myths surrounding women’s 
biological clocks.

Her book is sprinkled with 

anecdotes that provide insight into 
social mores of different times, 
which she then fleshes out well 
with nuanced analysis.

But the book is lacking in some 

significant areas. Weigel dedicates 
a substantial amount of time to 
online dating, or dating apps, but 
never addresses one of the biggest 
gender divides regarding meeting 
people online: women are much 
more likely to be scared that their 
date could be a potential rapist or 
serial killer. Relatedly, she glosses 
over how the pervasiveness and 
threat of sexual assault colors the 
experiences of women on college 
campuses. She also glosses over 
many of the social difficulties that 
members of the queer community 
still face, painting a much sunnier 
picture of current realities than 
many members of that community 
would like.

The conclusion almost com-

pletely negates the validity and 
possibility for total satisfaction in 
a single life and hints at the impor-
tance of reproduction in all rela-
tionships. This teleological ending 
point may feel insulting to those 
who don’t feel the need or want to 
think about it, for any reason, at any 
point in their lives.

“Labor of Love” delivers on its 

promise of a fresh and fun — at 
times even poignant — perspective 
on love, dating, sex, relationships 
and marriage and the intersections 
of those four. 

But as for proof that romance 

isn’t dead? Keep looking.

in a competition within the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
that 

selected which professors would 
represent the University in the 
application process.

Dus added that the grant is 

crucial for young scientists due to 
reduced funding available in the 
biomedical field. Without such 
funding, she would be unable 
to hire and train scientists and 
graduate students, resulting in 
slower research progress. Dus 
said this grant allows her the 
opportunity to explore a topic 
that has not received much 
research attention in the past.

“This really gives me the 

ability to focus on this really new 
question and have a few graduate 
students working on it for the 
next five years and build enough 
momentum so that I can make a 
case to the government that this 
is something really important 
to study and now have a ton 
of 
data 
that 

shows that it’s 
not something 
risky 
anymore,” Dus 
said. “It’s really 
a game changer 
for 
young 

scientists 
like 

me.”

Also 
a 

member 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Nutrition and Obesity Research 
Center 
and 
the 
Michigan 

Diabetes Research Center, Dus 
said she was always interested 
in how the environment — 
which includes pollution, stress 
or other intangible factors — 
changes the brain. Dus said she 
particularly focuses on diet as 
a form of environment because 
diet can change depending on the 
amount and the type of food and 
nutrients that are consumed.

“It’s also really relevant to 

today’s society because we have 
this biomedical crisis,” Dus said. 
“About 1.6 billion people … are 
either overweight or obese in 
the United States. If you have 10 
people in a room, eight essentially 
out of 10 will be overweight and 
about half of those obese. It’s a 
really huge public crisis because 
today we’re dying of chronic 
diseases like diabetes and cancer, 
and 
essentially 
Alzheimer’s, 

which are all linked to obesity.”

Dus uses fruit flies in her 

research 
to 
study 
how 
the 

brain sees sugar — particularly 
focusing on real versus fake sugar 

— because the flies have a similar 
physical structure to humans 
and exhibit complex behavioral 
patterns. In her research, Dus 
measures the changes in fruit 
flies’ metabolism, weight, the 
amount of food they eat and their 
behaviors and learning abilities.

Dus’ research ultimately shows 

that real sugar is absorbed by the 
brain differently than artificial 
sugars, which is indicative of why 
people have trouble controlling 
themselves around foods made 
with real sugar.

“Your brain actually mostly 

only sees the real sugar,” Dus said. 
“If you look at the micronutrients 
that we ingest the most in the last 
50 years, it’s mostly sugar; it’s not 
really fat.”

Robert 
Denver, 
chair 

of 
the 
Molecular, 
Cellular 

and 
Developmental 
Biology 

Department, agreed, saying it is 
important to link the environment 
and human behavior, especially 
in obesity research. He said it’s 
crucial for the department — 
particularly those focusing on 

this 
type 
of 

research — to 
receive grants 
so 
the 
basic 

processes 
leading 
to 

overeating can 
be understood 
and prevented.

“For 
many 

years 
there’s 

been an obesity epidemic in 
the United States, and it has 
actually spread throughout the 
world,” Denver said. “In 2013, the 
American Medical Association 
officially recognized obesity as 
a disease, which was a move that 
has actually caused physicians 
to pay more attention to the 
condition. Today it is estimated 
we spend around almost $200 
billion on obesity-related illness 
in the United States … there’s a 
lot of interest in understanding 
the causes of obesity and finding 
ways to treat it and to reverse it.”

Denver said obesity has a lot 

to do with one’s eating habits, 
behavior and the reinforcement 
of eating habits.

“There are reward centers in 

the brain that, when you eat a 
very highly palatable food, it just 
makes you want to eat more of 
it,” Denver said. “Since the early 
to mid-1970s, much of the food 
that is produced — processed 
food — has been engineered to 
be highly palatable … it causes 
people to want more and eat more 
and it ultimately leads to this 
reinforcement of the behavior.”

superfund designation, we would 
probably require a large amount 
of community input and a full 
understanding of how successful 
(the) EPA has been with respect to 
other dioxane sites in Michigan, 
what we could hope to achieve by 
obtaining 
that 

designation and 
frankly 
what 

risks we’d run 
by doing this.”

Scio 

Township 
Supervisor 
Spaulding Clark 
— who supports 
a 
superfund 

designation 
— 
told 
the 

Daily 
before 

the 
county’s 

vote that whether a superfund 
petition is ultimately pursued 
may rest with the city of Ann 
Arbor’s decision. Clark also said 
he has more confidence in the 
EPA than the DEQ to manage 
the contamination, and that he 
believes concerns about loss in 
property values are unfounded 
because affected properties still 
have access to public water and 
that the contamination has been 
long-known to realtors and home 
buyers.

“If both the county and the 

city have no interest in making 

this a superfund site, my guess is 
it won’t happen,” Clark said. “I 
think the reality is that Ann Arbor 
Township and Scio Township are 
awaiting a decision by Ann Arbor 
Township and the county as to 
whether they want to get into 
this.”

Although the DEQ and Pall 

Corporation — which acquired 
Gelman — have maintained a 

network 
of 

monitoring 
wells to track 
the 
plume 

since 
1992, 

Washtenaw 
County 
locals 

have 
long 

been 
critical 

of the state’s 
response, 
and the Flint 
water 
crisis 

re-energized 
public 

attention in January.

In March, the DEQ promised 

to revise groundwater safety 
standards for 1,4-dioxane to 
be in line with EPA cancer risk 
guidelines, which would grant 
the Michigan Attorney General 
standing to take new legal 
action against Pall Corporation 
for more thorough cleanup and 
remediation 
activities. 
In 
a 

June interview, Robert Wagner, 
chief of the DEQ Remediation 
Division, told the Daily the 
new regulations are on track 
to be submitted to the state 

legislature for approval in its 
9-month timeframe.

Nonetheless, 
a 
persistent 

dissatisfaction with the DEQ’s 
bureaucracy was visible in the 
county 
commission’s 
meeting, 

particularly with Commissioner 
Yousef Rabhi (D).

“We’re 
dealing 
with 
an 

organization that has ignored 
us for too long … that has set 
timelines and then broken their 
timelines, and I personally have 
no interest in continuing to be 
fooled by an organization that 
isn’t being held true to its own 
standards,” Rabhi said at the 
County Commission session. “I 
don’t believe it is the fault of the 
staff on the ground … but the DEQ 

is fundamentally flawed in its 
structure; the DEQ does not serve 
the people of Michigan, it serves 
the interests of the polluters and 
the corporate interests.”

The 
County 
Commision’s 

Wednesday resolution also called 
for Governor Rick Snyder (R) 
to expedite the passage of the 
new water standards by the state 
legislature. 

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor), 
who 
represents 
most 

of Washtenaw County, told the 
Daily in late June that, despite 
his past frustrations, he has been 
encouraged by the DEQ’s latest 
efforts and believes a rush to 
petition for EPA intervention 
would undermine this progress. 

However, Irwin also noted he 
does not have a firm position on 
superfund designation.

“I am as frustrated as anybody 

else about how the cleanup has 
been administered around the 
Gelman site, and I think the DEQ 
is part of that frustration,” Irwin 
said. “But I feel as though they’ve 
finally started to move in the right 
direction for this cleanup, and 
now that they’ve been working 
with us as partners, it might be a 
bad time to shift to a new partner. 
(The EPA) might be better, the 
EPA might take the situation more 
seriously, but they also might not, 
and they may also take a long time 
getting to the point that the DEQ 
has now been brought to.”

Shelina Zadorsky’s road to the 2016 Olympic Games

FILE PHOTO/Daily

In her senior year, Shelina Zadorsky captained the Michigan women’s soccer team that reached the Elite Eight in the 2013 season.

By BRADLEY WHIPPLE 

Summer Managing Editor

Shelina Zadorsky has always 

dreamt of competing on the 
world’s biggest soccer stages — 
either as a World Cup contender 
or an Olympic athlete.

Once the London, Ontario, 

native ended her storied career 
for the Michigan women’s soccer 
team in 2013, she debuted for 
the Canadian National Team 
and traveled the world to play 
professional soccer in pursuit 
of those dreams. Zadorsky has 
worked tirelessly in that two-
year span, waiting to see which 
major opportunity came first. 

When Zadorsky missed the 

2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup 
in Canada, she had one last 
goal: qualify for the Rio 2016 
Olympics.

Mission accomplished. 
On June 25, Canada Soccer 

and 
the 
Canadian 
Olympic 

Committee 
unveiled 
the 

18-player women’s soccer roster 
that included Zadorsky, who 
is looking to be the starting 
center back alongside Kadeisha 
Buchanan.

“It’s incredible just knowing 

that it’ll be such a big stage,” 
Zadorsky said. “I’m more excited 
than anything. I’m excited about 
the team connection we have and 
just the work we’ve been putting 
in as a team. We have incredible 
individuals 
and 
incredible 

leaders in our staff, as well. To 
play with the likes of Christine 
Sinclair and Diana Matheson 
and these veterans that have 
been there and know what it 
takes, to be able to learn from 
them, show up, 
do my absolute 
best 
and 
not 

only 
play 
for 

Canada but our 
goal is to win 
for Canada.

“Getting 
on 

the 
podium, 

that’s my goal, 
that’s our goal 
and I’m excited 
to see that happen.”

Zadorsky’s path toward Rio 

has been long in the making 
— nine years exactly. In 2007, 
Zadorsky made her debut with 
the Canadian Youth National 
Team 
under 
coach 
Bryan 

Rosenfeld. Later in 2008, she 
scored two goals for her team en 

route to a bronze medal at the 
CONCACAF Women’s Under-17 
Championship.

From 2010 to 2012, Zadorsky 

joined 
the 
Canadian 
U-20 

Women’s National Team, which 
earned a silver medal at the 
2012 championship in Panama. 
That 
same 
year, 
Zadorsky 

co-captained the FIFA U-20 
World Cup team that competed 
in Japan.

During those two years with 

the U-20 team, 
Zadorsky 
was 

also 
making 

huge strides at 
the 
collegiate 

level 
with 

Michigan under 
head 
coach 

Greg Ryan — 
who had spent 
three 
years 

coaching 
the 

U.S. Women’s National Team. 
When Zadorsky arrived in Ann 
Arbor in 2010, the Wolverines 
were in a major rebuilding phase.

But the arrival of Zadorsky 

marked a turning point in the 
program, as she was part of 
what would become arguably the 
program’s most successful and 

memorable senior class by 2013.

Zadorsky started every game 

her freshman year as Michigan 
wedged itself into the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
in four years. In 2011, the 
Wolverines lost seven players 
to 
injury 
or 
illness, 
giving 

Zadorsky the opportunity to 
shine on Michigan’s backline. 
That season, she scored her first 
goal and started 
all 19 games on 
defense.

After 
a 

Sweet 
Sixteen 

appearance 
in 

2012, Zadorsky 
captained 
the 

team with Holly 
Hein, 
Meghan 

Toohey 
and 

Nkem Ezurike 
(Michigan’s all-
time leading scorer) in their run 
to the 2013 Elite Eight.

With one goal and nine assists, 

Zadorsky had her best season 
yet, and she was ready to take her 
game to the next level.

That same year, Zadorsky 

made her senior debut with the 
Canadian national team, giving 
her an opportunity to pursue 

soccer after Michigan.

“I knew I still wanted to play, 

and I knew I had an opportunity 
with 
the 
Canadian 
national 

team,” Zadorsky said. “I had a 
little bit of improving to do and 
just maturing and growing.”

After graduating, Zadorsky 

also signed her first professional 
contract with Perth Glory in 
the 
Westfield 
W-League 
in 

Australia. 
In 

just her first 
season with the 
club, she made 
14 appearances 
and 
scored 

one 
goal 
as 

Perth 
Glory 

placed first in 
the league at 
the end of the 
regular season.

Rather than 

stay 
in 
Australia, 
Zadorsky 

spent the 2015 season competing 
for Vittsjö GIK, a football club 
in the Damallsvenskan, which 
is the country’s top women’s 
soccer league. During the 2015 
season, she appeared in 18 of 22 
games.

See Zadorsky. Page 11

“Getting on the 
podium, that’s 
my goal, that’s 

our goal.”

“I knew I had an 
opportunity with 

the Canadian 
national team.” 


FILE PHOTO/Daily

Shelina Zadorsky ended her career with 81 games played, three goals, 15 assists and 21 points. 

“It’s been awesome,” Zadorsky 

said. “It’s kinda been a bit of a 
whirlwind going from tournament 
to tournament and just learning 
from the best players and really 
improving my game.”

In July 2015, Zadorsky also 

participated in the Pan American 
Games in Toronto, which she 
described 
as 
a 
“smaller-scale 

Olympics.”

Though 

Zadorsky 
had 

spent the past 
two 
years 

traveling 
the 

world in pursuit 
of an Olympic 
dream, 
she 

somehow found 
herself rooming 
with 
Ezurike, 

who 
was 
also 

representing Canada in the games.

“It was like college all over again, 

which was really great,” Zadorsky 
said. “It’s such a small soccer world, 
but it’s great to see her doing well 
too.”

Unfortunately for the reunited 

duo, Canada fell in the bronze 
medal match to Mexico, which had 
rostered 
then-senior 
midfielder 

Christina Murillo — Michigan’s 
2015 captain and former teammate 
of Ezurike and Zadorsky. 
 

“It was like college all over again,

said. “It’s such a small soccer world, 
but it’s great to 
see 
her 
doing 

well too.”

Unfortunately

duo, Canada fell 
in 
the 
bronze 

medal match to 
Mexico, 
which 

had 
rostered 

then-senior 
midfielder 
Christina 
Murillo — Michigan’s 2015 captain 
and former teammate of Ezurike 
and Zadorsky. 

Though Michigan’s 2013 senior 

class are no longer together, they 
have still kept in touch in part 
because they all run the same 
soccer-centric 
lifestyle. 
Former 

midfielder Tori McCombs is also 
getting married this October, and 
the senior class, including Zadorsky, 
will be bridesmaids.

Zadorsky hasn’t forgotten to stay 

in touch with the coaching staff, 
and said she occasionally emails 
Ryan and associate head coach Dean 
Duerst. After the 2013 season, Ryan 
had emphasized that he would focus 
on helping his seniors transition 
to the professional soccer world in 

order for them to fulfill their goals.

According to Zadorsky, it was 

less about Ryan’s connections in 
the soccer world and more about 
physical preparation. 

“Ultimately, I think it was more 

of his training and his coaching that 
helped me get to the level I needed to 
get to and then I was able to branch 
out and find my own connections,” 

Zadorsky 
said. 

“At 
the 
same 

time, 
he 
was 

always 
such 
a 

great 
reference 

to have, he would 
always 
speak 

highly of us and 
he was always 
supporting us in 
that way.”

Part 
of 

Zadorsky 

finding her own connections has 
involved hiring a business manager 
and creating her own website, 
which includes a biography, media 
gallery, her agent’s contact info and 
information on her involvement 
with the Canadian National Team 
and the National Women’s Soccer 
League.

Most recently, Zadorsky began 

her first season with the NWSL’s 
Washington Spirit based out of 
Boyds, Md. Luckily for Zadorsky, she 
was part of a historic fourth season 
for the NWSL, which is now the 
longest-running American women’s 

soccer league.

“The 
other 

leagues 
before 

this have folded, 
but this one is 
growing 
and 

is going to stay 
around for quite 
some 
time,” 

Zadorsky 
said. 

“It’s really cool 
to be a part of the 
fourth season.”

Having to adapt to a faster-

paced NWSL, Zadorsky said her 
technical ability has grown “leaps 
and bounds.” At this level, it has to: 
everyone is stronger and everyone 
is faster, so her touches need to be 
better and her decision-making 
needs to be quicker.

“(In college), everyone’s still 

developing and has a lot of room for 
growth through college,” Zadorsky 
said. “At this level, people have so 
much experience and you just bring 
another level of professionalism to 
it. That comes with all the things on 
and off the pitch that’s a bit different 
because it is your job — you’re not 
juggling school and soccer, now 
you’re a true professional.”

Not only has the speed of the game 

changed, but Zadorsky has noticed a 
changing fan base. At Michigan, she 
said everyone could unite around 
the block M and say “Go Blue.”

Throughout the past few years, 

though, she has been able to reach 
an even wider audience with fan 
bases in Australia, Sweden and, most 
recently, Maryland. The bigger fan 
base has also brought an opportunity 
to mold young and upcoming soccer 
players 
around 

the world.

How Zadorsky 

and 
her 
team 

interact with the 
fan 
community 

on and off the 
field doesn’t go 
unnoticed 
as 

fans wear their 
jerseys, 
share 

photos 
through 

Twitter and make signs for Zadorsky 
at games.

“It’s really, really inspiring to see 

young girls looking up to you and 
wanting to work to be a professional,” 
Zadorsky said. “Hopefully I can 
inspire them in a positive way.”

Zadorsky’s next chance to inspire 

her fans will come on August 5, when 
the Rio 2016 Women’s Olympic 
Football Tournament begins in Sao 

Paolo, Brazil. The reigning bronze 
medalist 
Canadians 
will 
face 

Australia, Zimbabwe and Germany 
in Group F.

This year has already been a 

successful one for the national team, 
which qualified for the Olympic 
Games in February and later won 
the Algarve Women’s Cup in Lagos, 
Portugal, after defeating Brazil, 2-1, 
in the championship match.

The 
team 

has 
already 

developed 
chemistry 
as 

well, with Diana 
Matheson 
and 

Stephanie Labbé 
currently playing 
with 
Zadorsky 

on 
the 
Spirit. 

The 
national 

team will train 

together all of July, missing just a 
few NWSL games before the league 
goes on break in August.

When Zadorsky returns to the 

United States at the end of August, 
she will have fulfilled her dream of 
representing home country in the 
Olympics.

The only thing left to do? Return 

with a medal hanging around her 
neck.

“(Ryan’s) coaching 
helped me get to 
the level I needed 

to get to.”

“It’s been a 

whirlwhind going 
from tournament 
to tournament.”

“It’s inspiring to 
see young girls 
looking up to 

you.”

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Michigan 
head 
swimming 

coach Mike Bottom was named 
an assistant coach of the U.S. 
men’s team for this summer’s 
Olympic Games.

“I’ve been dreaming about this 

since I was 10 years old,” Bottom 
said in a statement Sunday. “This 
is my Olympic dream. I’m ready 
to do whatever it takes to help the 
U.S. be successful in Rio. I can’t 
wait to get started.”

Despite this being his first 

time coaching the U.S. team at 
the Olympics, Bottom has had a 
lot of experience at the Games 
— he has coached at the past 
five, and had also previously 
said that he would be coaching 
Michigan sophomore Mokhtar 
Al-Yamani 
and 
Al-Yamani’s 

country, Yemen, at this year’s 
competition in Rio.

“In the past I’ve been with 

other small countries,” Bottom 
said at a press conference May 31. 
“The nice thing about coaching 
with a small country is that I 
can coach everybody. I’ve signed 
something that says I won’t coach 
against the U.S. team, so that 
gives me the freedom to do what 
I do.”

Bottom, who coaches both the 

men’s and women’s swimming 

and diving teams at Michigan, 
spent the early part of the 
summer in Ann Arbor helping 
current 
team 
members 
and 

alumni — as well as other athletes 
representing 
countries 
from 

across the world — train for the 
U.S. Olympic Team Trials, which 
have taken place over the past 
week.

Bottom has been in Omaha 

for the trials as several current 
and 
former 
Wolverines 
have 

competed for coveted spots on 
the national team.

Notable performances came 

from alum Connor Jaeger, who 
also swam at the 2012 Olympic 
Games, qualified for the 1,500-
meter freestyle and 400-meter 
freestyle by winning both events, 
while alum Tyler Clary, who won 
a gold medal in 2012, narrowly 
missed out on qualifying for this 
year’s games after finishing third 
in the 200-meter backstroke.

Bottom will now get a chance 

to be part of the U.S. team for the 
second time in his life — he had 
previously qualified for the 100-
meter fly in 1980, but the U.S. 
boycotted that year’s games as 
they were held in Moscow during 
the Cold War.

Now, close to 40 years later, he 

will look to help his country to 
success — this time, though, he 
will be out of the water.

Mueller talks about his experience 
playing in U.S. Open as amateur

Despite missing the 
cut, Mueller was able 
to keep up with the 
world’s best golfers

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

It was during his freshman 

year of college that Michigan 
junior Kyle Mueller realized he 
had a legitimate chance of one 
day qualifying for the U.S. Open.

He had tried to qualify a few 

years 
prior, 

before coming 
to Ann Arbor, 
but missed out 
by five strokes.

“I 
was 
an 

okay golfer in 
high 
school 

— not a great 
golfer,” 
Mueller 
said. 

“But when I got 
to 
Michigan 

my game started to develop, I 
became a better player and I got 
some confidence.”

So when a year and a half 

later Mueller competed at the 
U.S. Open Sectional Qualifier 
in Springfield, Ohio, it was no 
surprise that he was able to 
come in second place — securing 
his spot among the best in the 
world at Oakmont Country Club 
outside of Pittsburg, June 16-19.

Heading into the week, the 

tournament didn’t feel all that 
different from the collegiate 
or 
amateur 
tournaments 

Mueller 
was 

accustomed 
to. 
He 
still 

had 
to 
sign 

his scorecard, 
he still had to 
think through 
what 14 clubs 
to put in his 
bag and most 
of all, he still 
had to shoot 
a low score. 
But for an amateur used to 
playing against other student-
athletes, there was one notable 
difference: the competition.

“When 
you’re 
driving 
in 

the 
front 
gates 
or 
driving 

at the driving range, you’re 
surrounded by the best players 
in the world,” Mueller said. 
“It was pretty cool to just be 
surrounded by all these guys, 
and growing up you idolize 
these guys and want to be like 
them.”

Mueller 
was 
surrounded 

by many of the world’s most-
idolized 
players 
early 
in 

the 
week, 
playing 
practice 

rounds 
alongside 
defending 

U.S. Open champion Jordan 
Spieth, defending British Open 
Championship Zach Johnson 

and 
two-

time 
Masters 

champion 
Bubba Watson.

He 
also 

played 
alongside 
James 
Hahn, 

whom Mueller 
had 
met 
six 

years 
earlier 

when 
Hahn 

was 
playing 

a 
tournament 
in 
Mueller’s 

hometown 
of 

Athens, 
Ga. 

Hahn stayed at 
Mueller’s house 
during 
the 

tournament, 
and has since 
been 
one 
of 

his 
favorite 

players.

“I 
was 

definitely in contact with some 
of the best players in the world,” 
Mueller said. “I really got to pick 
their brains about what they 

were 
thinking 

about 
the 

course, 
course 

management 
and really just 
how they play 
golf.”

When 

Thursday 
hit, 

Mueller 
played 

alongside 
professionals 
Richie 

Schembechler, 
a 
distant 

relative 
of 
Michigan 
great 

Bo Schembechler, and Derek 
Chang. On Thursday he shot 
a seven-over-par, 77, and on 
Friday he shot a three-over-par, 

73, for a total of a ten-over-par, 
150 — a decent score for a first-
time amateur, but alas below the 
six-over-par needed to make the 
cut and play on the weekend.

“I would say I played a lot 

better than my score reflected,” 
Mueller said. “I was a little 
disappointed I missed the cut; I 
felt that I had some silly mistakes 
throughout both rounds that 
could have easily been avoided, 
just stuff I don’t normally do 
when playing competitive golf. 
I wasn’t really nervous. I felt 
comfortable in both rounds.”

But although his weekend 

ended early, the two days he 
spent in the tournament, in 
addition to the practice days 
earlier in the week, gave him a 
more important revelation than 
the one experienced during 
his 
freshman 
year: 
he 
felt 

comfortable amongst the best in 
the world.

Where Mueller at first saw 

professionals as otherworldly 
athletes, he later saw entirely 
different 
things 
— 
human 

compatriots 
with the same 
motives 
and 

goals as he had.

“I 
would 

pass 
Jordan 

Spieth in the 
locker 
room, 

and 
the 
first 

couple 
days 

I was there I 

was like, ‘Wow! That’s Jordan 
Spieth,’ ”Mueller said. “But by 
the end of it, he was just another 
guy trying to do what I’m doing.”

For the rest of the summer, 

Mueller is scheduled to play in 
various amateur tournaments 
across 
the 
United 
States, 

culminating in the U.S. Amateur 
at 
Oakland 
Hills 
Country 

Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mi. 
— only 40 miles from Ann 
Arbor. These tournaments will 
feature 
the 
players 
Mueller 

is more accustomed to: high 
schoolers and college students 
trying to establish a footing for 
themselves. But as his week at 
Oakmont taught him, no matter 
the tournament, the competitors 
have the same goal, and no 
matter the competitors, Mueller 
can feel right at home.

score reflected.”
