Dr. 
Jeanice 
Swift, 

superintendent 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

Public Schools (AAPS), announced 
on May 13 that the School Age 
Child Care program (SACC) will 
not be offered during the 2021-
2022 school year. According to 
AAPS, SACC is a state-licensed 
child care program designed to 
meet the needs of working parents 
by offering planned and supervised 
activities before and after school .

This decision stunned AAPS 

parents 
and 
was 
met 
with 

immediate 
backlash. 
AAPS 

parents 
Liz 
Lin 
and 
Andrea 

Huang co-authored a petition to 
resume the program. The petition 
currently has over 1100 signatures 
from parents in the AAPS district.

While AAPS has been operating 

under a hybrid teaching mode since 
May 3, the childcare program has 
not been available. Some parents 
have been making their plans 
to return to work around the 
assumption that SACC would be 
available for their young children. 

“We planned on me staying home 

until school resumed this fall,” 
AAPS parent David Hanss said. 
“Now, we’re in a position where 
we may have to hire a babysitter or 
nanny for before and after school. 
Getting a job and not knowing 

how we’ll handle childcare will be 
difficult.”

During a May 13 community 

information session, Swift said 
there 
was 
currently 
no 
plan 

for hybrid instruction in AAPS 
programming for Fall 2021, as early 
childhood education through 12th 
grade will return to full, in-school 
learning and activities five days per 
week.

In a May 14 superintendent 

update to the AAPS community, 
Swift said the two main factors in 
the decision to not offer childcare 
were concerns of the COVID-
related complications of the large 
group nature of SACC and a 
staffing shortage.

“AAPS has used a large group 

model for childcare, with students 
in the cafeteria or gym, which is 
not a COVID safe model that will 
work well for children this fall,” 
Swift said. “Staffing such a large 
program has presented a challenge 
for several years, now exacerbated 
by COVID.”

A shortage of child care workers 

has been a nationwide problem, 
exacerbated by the pandemic. 
AAPS did not post any openings 
for these positions to help alleviate 
this concern in preparation for the 
fall.

The capacity limitations that 

Swift said are a main concern 
for SACC operation have been 
revised by both the Center for 
Disease Control (CDC) and the 

State of Michigan. CDC data 
for Washtenaw County shows a 
consistent downward trend of new 
COVID-19 cases, and provides 
guidelines about how childcare 
programs can operate safely.

Last 
week, 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer said there will be no 
limit on the number of people 
for indoor gatherings as of July 
1st. Additionally, the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Licensing 
and 

Regulatory Affairs (LARA) has 
provided 
guidelines 
for 
safe 

childcare 
operations 
during 

COVID-19.

“Schools 
are 
strongly 

encouraged to allow child care and 
after school programming to occur 
in person in school buildings,” the 
State of Michigan guidelines for 
safe school operation reads.

Some parents were concerned 

that AAPS never consulted with 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department 
(WCHD) 
about 

their decision to not offer SACC. 
Additionally, 
AAPS 
will 
not 

provide the list of the experts Swift 
said they are consulting weekly 
about this issue, despite public 
records requests for one. Swift did 
not respond to multiple requests 
for comment about this concern 
in time for publication, and the 
WCHD would not comment on the 
record. 

Walter Lasecki, a University 

of Michigan computer science 
professor, will resign on Aug. 
30 following the publication of 
a Michigan Daily investigation 
that 
exposed 
multiple 

allegations of sexual misconduct 
against 
him. 
Lasecki’s 

resignation 
was 
announced 

in 
a 
Friday 
night 
email 

from Computer Science and 
Engineering (CSE) department 
chairs. Effective immediately, 
Lasecki will have no in-person 
contact 
with 
University 
of 

Michigan students, according to 
the email.

The U-M Office of Public 

Affairs 
confirmed 
Saturday 

morning 
that 
Lasecki 
had 

submitted his resignation.

In another email obtained by 

The Michigan Daily, University 
Title IX coordinator Elizabeth 
Seney sought information on 
22 
previously 
undisclosed 

accounts of sexual harassment 
by Lasecki, writing on Friday to 
an individual with knowledge 
of the allegations. An identical 
email was sent to two other 
individuals, The Daily learned 
Friday.

“I 
understand 
that 
you 

may be aware of a total of 22 
individuals who have disclosed 
they’ve 
experienced 
sexual 

misconduct 
by 
the 
faculty 

member, 
many 
of 
whose 

concerns have not previously, 
to 
my 
understanding, 
been 

reported to the University,” 
Seney wrote. “I also understand 
that you may be aware of 
concerns of inappropriate and 
possibly retaliatory contact of 
a University graduate student 
related to their prior reporting 
of concerns.” 

Seney wrote that she hoped 

the individual would be able 
to provide the Title IX office 
with the information necessary 
to 
ensure 
the 
appropriate 

action is taken against sexual 
misconduct.

The University of Michigan is 

planning to hold a fall semester 
mostly 
featuring 
a 
return 
to 

normalcy, 
including 
in-person 

instruction for small and medium 
size classes, on-campus housing and 
large crowds at sports games. This is 
largely due to the state of Michigan’s 
and the University’s progress in 
COVID-19 vaccinations.

In a previous interview with 

The Michigan Daily, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
said 

vaccinations against COVID-19 are 
crucial to the University’s plans to 
open in the fall.

“The greater fraction of people 

who are vaccinated, the more likely 
we are to have a semester in the 
fall that feels as close to normal as 
possible,” Schlissel said. “The best 
case scenario is that 95 or 98% of 
students and an overwhelming 
majority of faculty and staff are 
vaccinated.”

Vaccination Updates
Everybody over the age of 12 

in Michigan is currently eligible 
to get vaccinated. At the time 
of publication, 58.1% of eligible 
Michigan residents have received 
at least one shot of a COVID-19 
vaccine. Washtenaw County has 
one of the highest rates of COVID-19 
vaccination in Michigan, with 62.4% 
of those eligible receiving at least 
one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Anybody 12 years or older can 

receive a COVID-19 vaccine at 
Michigan Medicine. The University 
urges 
vaccinated 
students 
to 

report their vaccination status to 
Wolverine Access. This information 
will be used to inform plans for the 
fall semester and will allow students 
to opt out of regular COVID-19 
testing in the fall. 

LSA sophomore Ava Ben-David 

was impressed with how easy it is 
to access COVID-19 vaccines in Ann 
Arbor. 

“(I) think that vaccinations are 

very accessible, and that people 
are getting them,” Ben-David said. 
“Every single one of my friends is 
vaccinated, and I don’t really know 
anyone that isn’t vaccinated.”

In an email to The Daily, 

University 
spokesperson 
Kim 

Broekhuizen said the University 
expects many students to get a 
COVID-19 vaccine without making 
it mandatory.

“We remain confident that … 

we will have a sufficiently high 
percentage 
of 
our 
community 

vaccinated,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“Encouragement may be more 
effective than a mandate to achieve 
the goal of maximizing vaccinations 
against COVID-19 in the months 
ahead. Any student who is in 
need of vaccination will have the 
opportunity to be vaccinated when 
they arrive in Ann Arbor.”

Some 
faculty 
have 
grown 

frustrated with the lack of a vaccine 
mandate for students living on 
campus 
and 
attending 
classes 

during the upcoming fall semester. 
In early May, over 700 instructors 
signed on to a petition calling for 
a vaccine mandate. In the event 
that the administration refused 
to institute a mandate, the faculty 
members requested that instructors

Vaccines are here. Here’s 

what you need to know 

about U-M’s fall semester

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Art 
Fair 

will be held after all this July, 
leaders of all three Ann Arbor 
Art Fairs (Ann Arbor Original 
Art Fair, The State Street Art 
Fair and the Summer Art Fair) 
announced in a joint statement 
released on Thursday. The move 
comes after the Art Fair was 
initially canceled on May 12 due 
to COVID-19 safety concerns 
and protocols limiting outdoor 
gatherings. In the statement, 
Art Fair Leaders wrote that Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer’s May 20 
announcement that all outdoor 
gathering 
restrictions 
would 

expire on June 1 paved the way 
for the Ann Arbor Art Fair to 
return in full swing. 

“In 
light 
of 
the 
recent 

announcement 
lifting 
the 

restrictions on outdoor events, 
the Fair Directors met with city 
officials and the local health 
department and decided that 
a safe and successful event 
could be achieved after all,” the 
organizers wrote. 

Due to the late timing of the 

decision, the Art Fair has been 
condensed from four to three days 
— July 15, 16 and 17. Additionally, 
the 
fair 
will 
be 
instituting 

stronger safety measures and 
protocols, organizers said.

“This year’s event will include 

more 
space 
between 
booths 

to allow for social distancing, 
masks will be encouraged and 
hand sanitizing stations will 
be throughout the fair,” the 
organizers wrote. “Fair staff will 
also continue working closely 
with the health department to 
ensure the safety of the artists, 
fairgoers, staff and everyone 
involved.”

uncomfortable 
with 
teaching 

unvaccinated students be able to opt 
out of in person instruction.

Studnts who are not vaccinated 

against COVID-19 will be required 
to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. 
However, as of May 20, Broekhuizen 
said the University has verified more 
than 13,300 vaccinated students. 

In December 2020, shortly after the 

first Emergency Use Authorization 
of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United 
States, Michigan Medicine released 
the “Blue Queue Questionnaire.” 
All U-M and Michigan Medicine 
students, faculty, staff and employees 
were encouraged to fill out the 
Questionnaire. The Questionnaire 
asked participants about certain 
criteria, such as age and occupation, 
as well as interest level in getting a 
COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were 
emailed when they became eligible 
for a vaccine.

On Tuesday, May 18, the Blue 

Queue sent an email writing that 
everybody 
who 
demonstrated 

interest in receiving a COVID-19 
vaccine through the Blue Queue 
have been officially told that they are 
eligible for vaccination.

“We have at this point been able 

to clear the ‘Queue,’” the email said. 
“All U-M Personnel who completed 
the Blue Queue questionnaire and 
indicated an interest in the COVID-
19 vaccine have been invited to 
schedule an appointment or received 
the vaccine elsewhere.”

Residence Halls
Residence halls are planning to 

open this fall at no more than 80% 
capacity. Students planning to live 
in on-campus housing are required 
to be vaccinated against COVID-
19 and need to report receiving 
the vaccine to Wolverine Access 
by 5 p.m. on July 16. The Michigan 
Housing website says any students 
unable to meet this deadline should 
contact MHousing. The University 
will accept any vaccines approved 
by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration 
(FDA), 
including 

the 
Pfizer-BioNTech, 
Moderna 

and Johnson & Johnson/Jannsen 
vaccines, or the World Health 
Organization 
(WHO), 
including 

the AstraZeneca (Covishield) and 
Sinopharm vaccines.

The University said it will help 

students get a vaccine if they arrive 
on campus unvaccinated, which has 
been of particular concern for some 
international students who come 
from countries that have not received 
many doses of the vaccine.

According 
to 
the 
MHousing 

website, limited exceptions to the 
vaccination requirement will be 
allowed. Students may apply for a 
vaccine waiver no later than July 
16. Students who receive a vaccine 
waiver will be required to undergo 
regular COVID-19 testing to live 
on-campus.

University 
of 
Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel is facing 
backlash from U-M faculty and 
campus 
organizations 
after 

portraying 
expanded 
tuition 

assistance 
for 
UM-Flint 
and 

UM-Dearborn 
students 
as 
a 

financial and academic burden on 
the UM-Ann Arbor campus. 

In a survey sent to over 

4,000 faculty, Schlissel asked 
faculty to rate their agreement 
with the statement: “UM-Ann 
Arbor should provide funding 
for students at UM-Flint and 
UM-Dearborn to benefit from 
the Go Blue Guarantee even if 
it means sacrificing academic 
excellence or lower salary growth 
on the Ann Arbor campus.” 
Screenshots of the survey, which 
is part of Schlissel’s annual 
formal evaluation, were posted 
by faculty to Twitter Wednesday. 
Schlissel also asked faculty in the 
survey about their comfort level 
with in-person teaching and their 
satisfaction with progress on U-M 
diversity and inclusion efforts. 

The 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee 

campaign, 
launched 
for 
the 

UM-Ann Arbor campus in 2018, 
offers free tuition for in-state 
families with collective incomes 
under $65,000. In the years since, 
representatives from U-M Flint 
and U-M Dearborn have worked 
to bring the program to their 
respective campuses to increase 
its outreach to students. UM-Ann 
Arbor 
campus 
community 

members have also called for the 
program to be extended to the 
satellite campuses. 

The phrasing of the Go Blue 

Guarantee question on the survey 
received backlash from faculty 
because of its implication that 
the University would have to 
sacrifice the quality of education 
and faculty in exchange for 
affordability 
for 
students, 

multiple faculty members told 
The Michigan Daily. 

The U-M Office of Public 

Affairs did not respond directly 
to a question of whether Schlissel 
believes extending the Go Blue 
Guarantee 
to 
UM-Flint 
and 

UM-Dearborn would “sacrifice 

academic excellence” and “lower 
salary growth” at UM-Ann Arbor.

In an interview with The 

Daily last month, Schlissel said 
the leadership of UM-Flint and 
UM-Dearborn were considering 
instituting the Go Blue Guarantee 
on their own. 

“If they decided to do a Go 

Blue Guarantee, they would take 
money away from somewhere 
else,” Schlissel said. “So they’re 
making the balancing act or 
values judgement about what 
is best needed on each of their 
campuses.”

Schlissel said the Ann Arbor 

campus instituted the guarantee 
because it had very few students 
from the bottom 50% of the 
socioeconomic strata in the state 
of Michigan. 

“We wanted to invest in 

making sure that Michigan in 
Ann Arbor was accessible to 
people throughout the economic 
spectrum,” Schlissel said.

42% of UM-Dearborn and 39% 

of UM-Flint students qualify for 
the Pell Grant, a federal grant 
awarded 
to 
high-achieving 

students with financial need, 
who are not eligible to receive 
Go Blue Guarantee benefits as 
they are not enrolled on the Ann 
Arbor campus. 15% of UM-Ann 
Arbor students qualify for the 
Pell Grant.

One University, a faculty- and 

student-led group that advocates 
for equitable funding across the 
University’s 
three 
campuses, 

released a statement condemning 
the wording of Schlissel’s survey 
and calling for an apology.

The One University campaign 

said the survey “traffics in the 
most base classist and racist 
assumptions about our students;” 
“pits 
working-class 
students 

at Flint and Dearborn against 
faculty 
salaries 
at 
UM-Ann 

Arbor;” 
“threatens 
(faculty) 

with 
lower 
salaries 
if 
they 

support 
those 
(lower-income) 

students;” “implies that it is 
exclusively the priorities of the 
Ann Arbor campus that matter 
when 
formulating 
university 

policy;” and is “clearly designed 
to elicit a particular result, which 
happens to align with the policy 
preferences of the President.”

On the one-year anniversary of 

the murder of George Floyd, the 
Ann Arbor Independent Police 
Oversight Commission (ICPOC) 
both reflected on the past of police 
violence in the nation and in the 
community and looked forward 
to the future of policing in Ann 
Arbor.

A year ago, Minneapolis police 

officer Derek Chauvin knelt on 
George Floyd’s neck for nine 
minutes and 29 seconds while 
other 
officers 
watched 
Floyd 

die. In response to the murder 
and national outrage, protests in 
cities across the world took place 
in search of systemic change. 
Following the response, Chauvin 
was fired and more recently found 
guilty of second-degree murder, 
third-degree murder and second-
degree manslaughter.

The 
meeting 
opened 
with 

a prayer from Pastor Mashod 
Evans from Ann Arbor’s Bethel 
AME Church, a historically Black 
community institution in the 
city. Evans called on the meeting 
attendees to remember the long 
historical legacy of the murder 
of Black people in the U.S. and to 
acknowledge how the fight to end 
this violence continues every day. 

“While we have lost a brother, 

a friend, in George Floyd and 
so many, that has spurred a 
movement for something greater, 
something 
newer, 
something 

better,” Evans said.

Dr. Lisa Jackson, chair of the 

commission, then opened the 
public forum with a statement 
of reflection on Floyd’s murder 
and also the numerous other 
incidents of violence committed 
against Black people over the 
years. Jackson emphasized that 
for Ann Arbor to make substantive 
progress, the community must 
establish meaningful oversight.

“Meaningful oversight means 

that the results of oversight 
actually change the way that 
policing is done in our city in a way 
that is just for all of its inhabitants, 
workers and visitors,” Jackson 
said. “Meaningful oversight means 
that when a policing mistake 
is made it is not obfuscated. 

Meaningful oversight means that 
when something happens to you, 
you feel safe going to the police 
because you know the police are 
actually accountable to you.” 

Jackson then went on to discuss 

two projects the committee is 
involved in in the city: establishing 
a system of responders responsible 
for mental health crises, instead 
of police, and the creation of 
unarmed traffic enforcement. 

“It is only by taking officers 

out of situations that they’re not 
equipped to handle and holding 
those officers who abuse their 
authority 
accountable 
(that) 

we can create the conditions 
for real relationships between 
the community and the police,” 
Jackson said.

Unarmed traffic enforcement 

has been made a priority in cities 
such 
as 
Berkeley, 
California, 

and the committee expressed a 

desire to follow their example. In 
cities such as Denver, successful 
changes have been made to send 
health care workers instead of 
police in response to mental health 
crises.

State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 

Arbor, spoke about a bipartisan 
package proposed in the State 
Senate that includes bills targeting 
accountability and transparency 
in policing. If passed, the bills 
would 
ban 
chokeholds 
and 

no-knock warrants. Irwin’s bill 
focuses 
on 
de-escalation 
and 

de-stigmatization 
of 
mental 

illness.

“I proposed this bill to include 

training to help officers recognize 

their implicit bias and require 
training to help identify people 
who are having a mental health 
crisis and how to deescalate that,” 
Irwin said.

Throughout the meeting, there 

was also much discussion of 
optimism and the role it plays or 
doesn’t play in activism. 

Commissioner 
and 
LSA 

sophomore Makiah Shipp said 
many negative police interactions 
have been harmfully normalized, 
but 
that 
people 
should 
be 

optimistic about the work that 
young activists are doing, on the 
University of Michigan campus 
especially.

“When 
you 
think 
about 

maintaining optimism or grabbing 
a little bit if you’ve lost it all, I 
hope that you can do so for our 
generation,” Shipp said. 

Shipp also said serious work 

needs to be done in examining 

the role that the U-M Division of 
Public Safety and Security (DPSS) 
plays on campus. 

“(DPSS is) equally as important, 

because those are the people that 
are also interacting with students 
and regular people on campus,” 
Shipp said. “People will have 
PTSD from police interaction and 
nobody believes it.” 

Former 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Councilmember 
Stephen 

Kunselman 
talked 
about 
the 

importance 
of 
police 
in 
the 

communities and how, even with 
their flaws, the police’s role should 
not go unappreciated.

the trend doesn’t seem to be slowing 
down. TikTok had amassed over 689 
million active users as of January 
2021, and over 60% of them were 
people under 30 — including many 
Gen Z kids creating comedy, fashion, 
dance and beauty videos. 

TikTok is known for its pageantry 

and trendiness, with young women 
and girls posting elaborate beauty 
transformations set to viral music 
and using flattering filters. Young 
women like Loren Grey and Charli 
D’Amelio are hugely responsible for 
many of TikTok’s trends as well as its 
popularity. And for a generation of 
young people that grew up on iPods 
and iPads, social media applications 
like TikTok are nothing new. Many 
image and video-focused social 
media applications like Instagram, 
Twitter and Snapchat carry much 
of the same content. However, 
TikTok’s interface has inspired 
staggering 
fashion 
and 
beauty 

trends often led by young women 
on the platform. One common video 
trend starts with a girl lip-syncing 
to music in a shabby outfit, looking 
moderately unkempt. The next 
moment — ideally at the drop of the 
beat — the girl transforms into a 
fashion fantasy, with wild clothing, 
hair and a pleased look on her face 
as she admires herself while dancing. 

Despite its fun, the internet has 

never — and likely will never — be a 
safe place for young girls looking to 
express themselves. While scrolling, 
I often see TikToks of girls dressed 
in vibrant, show-stopping looks 
with a caption poking fun at 
potential 
conservative 
Karens 

who would disapprove. These 

bold young women echo feminist 
ideals of wearing whatever one 
wants, 
whether 
scantily-clad 

or 
conservatively 
dressed, 
no 

matter the opinions of society. I 
see their strong sense of identity 
and 
self-expression 
and 
feel 

happy that they’ve found a corner 
of the internet where they can 
confidently show off and unleash 
their creativity. At the same time, I 
feel an intuitive pull to warn them 
of their vulnerability.

Young people who routinely post 

themselves on TikTok risk exposing 
themselves 
to 
being 
digitally 

consumed, and even approached, by 
adult predators. Children ages 12 to 
15, who comprise a significant chunk 
of TikTok users, are especially at 
risk for internet sexual harassment. 
In recent years, TikTok has been 
accused of being a hub for pedophiles 
with little punishment for those 
who engage inappropriately with 
minors. Even more concerning, 
rates of femicide, sexual violence 
and harassment against women, 
both in-person and online, have 
been climbing since the start of the 
pandemic. This is part of an overall 
uptick in online harassment against 
women and girls. 

Participating in the fun of social 

media is a part of growing up in the 
digital age, and I wholeheartedly 
want to encourage the fun. And yet, 
the perspective of “I wear what I 
want, no matter the stares I get” is 
at odds with the notion that self-
expression, creativity and sensuality 
are not safe to display online. 

M

usic is considered to be a 
universal communicator 
of human emotions. This 

can be seen in the ever-present 
K-pop craze, as English-speaking 
fans rock out to hits in a completely 
different language. If 10 people 
with 10 different native tongues 
were listening to Kool & The Gang 
sing “Celebrate good times, come 
on!” together, it wouldn’t matter that 
some might not fully understand the 
lyrics — the jovial brass and funk 
guitar communicate in the same 
way that the words do. Depending 
on cultural background and life 
experience, individuals are bound 
to glean a variety of emotional 
experiences from the same piece of 
music, but there is always emotion to 
be found nonetheless. The language 
of music truly knows no bounds — 
that is, until a prospective music 
student finds out they can’t fit the 
requirements to be admitted into a 
music program.

That barrier is one I’ve given 

much thought to recently. My senior 
year of high school was the first 
time I thought of music composition 
as an actual possibility for a major, 
and I became incredibly excited at 
the idea. Some research about the 
University of Michigan’s program 
in October revealed that up to seven 
original works, scored and recorded, 
were required for the application 
due in December, plus a recording of 
the student playing their preferred 
instrument of focus. And if all that 
works out, you get the opportunity 

to interview in the spring. I did not 
end up completing a portfolio in 
time. Today I sit in musical limbo, 
wanting to compose with my entire 
heart and then some, but unable to 
get in the door.

It can be saddening to be barred 

from studying and developing 
something that feels so entwined 
with your existence. Unfortunately, 
this has been the majority of my 
music experience at the University. 
I have strong musical instincts 
and abilities in, apparently, all the 
wrong areas, like harmonizing, 
sight-reading and learning music 
by ear. I do play the violin, sing and 
read sheet music, but not to a high 
enough level that it will get me 
anywhere that I want to go here — 
including the music composition 
program. 

In the digital audio workstations 

like Logic Pro and Ableton that 
people use for music production, 
there’s a built-in tool for correcting 
any note or drum hit that doesn’t 
fall precisely on a beat. This is 
called quantization. Jacob Collier, 
a prolific musician and Grammy-
winning artist, is an advocate for 
un-quantizing music. In a January 
2020 livestream, he mentions his 
desire to “get the grid out of people’s 
psychologies,” describing the result 
of quantizing as “something which is 
… grid-based, which is not human.” He 
goes on to say that “grids are not the 
same as humans. Humans are some 
of the least grid-based creatures … in 
the world, in the universe.” Collier 

also briefly mentions how education 
accomplishes 
something 
eerily 

similar, keeping different subjects in 
neatly separate containers.

It is not a new idea that the 

separation of subjects presents a 
skewed and frankly untrue view 
of how different knowledge bases 
operate and interact. Music is a 
culmination of science and math and 
art, and oftentimes philosophy. Yet 
it is still kept quantized, even at our 
university. 

I’d like to acknowledge the 

perspective I’m writing from, which 
is that of a student in LSA who 
doesn’t have a lot of technical skill 
on the violin and has taken only a 
year of classical singing lessons. I am 
very much someone on the outside 
looking in at what I haven’t gained 
access to. This whole column could 
be seen as fist-shaking at the musical 
doors that I haven’t worked as hard as 
others to enter. The audition process 
is completely understandable for 
performance majors, and I get why 
it’s the typical mode of admission for 
music programs everywhere. There 
are people in the world who lack 
rhythm, good pitch or both, and it 
would be nearly impossible to study 
certain aspects of music without 
these qualities, let alone prepare for 
years to have other people pay for 
your skills.

define ourselves by the institutions 
we occupied when we interacted with 
them constantly. I’m sure that if a ran-
dom person asked me, “Tell me about 
yourself,” during a regular year, I 
might mention the university which I 
attend, but since I live at home, and all 
of my classes have been online, the fact 
that I attend the University of Michi-
gan barely crosses my mind. 

Since we’ve been so removed 

from personal connection, the idea of 
“school spirit” feels foreign. What will 
football games look like? Will people 
still be proud to sport maize and blue? 
To define themselves by the school 
they attend? The answers could swing 
to extremes. Many, feeling lonely, may 
be extremely eager to participate in 
school spirit and make up for lost time, 

whereas others may feel alienated and 
therefore unwelcome by communi-
ties and events they would, in normal 
times, be familiar with. I have no clue 
what the next year brings, but I know 
it will be quite odd.

After mask mandates for vaccinated 

people were lifted in Michigan and 
many classes are scheduled to be in-
person in the fall, a return to “normal-
cy” may be approaching. It’s important 
that we remember what we discovered 
in isolation, and bring it with us. As we 
move into the unknown, we can only 
hope that we preserve the eagerness to 
find our true selves, as well as our irrev-
erence for powerful institutions.

Op-Ed: Why we need the Campus Conservation Corps

We’ve changed. Now what?

OPINION

MEERA KUMAR | OPINION COLUMNIST

TYLER WATT, ZACKARIAH FARAH, ERIK WILLIAMS AND RILEY LIST

Ninety years ago, millions of young 

Americans embarked on a journey 
to revitalize a polluted and environ-
mentally degraded nation. They were 
members of the Civilian Conservation 
Corps, a program created by former 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
in 1933 to repair America’s natural 
beauty while also creating millions of 
jobs. The Civilian Conservation Corps 
planted over 3.5 billion trees nation-
wide, including nearly 500 million in 
Michigan alone. Despite the tremen-
dous success of the Civilian Conserva-
tion Corps, funding for the program 
ran out in 1942, shortly after the start 
of World War II.

As we walk through our campus 

today, the accomplishments of the 
Civilian Conservation Corps seem 
distant and nearly forgotten. The 
lack of an organized effort to main-
tain and protect our environment is 
abundantly clear. There is garbage in 
our streets, sidewalks and even the 
Diag — nearly everywhere. It’s some-

thing that we blind ourselves to at this 
point. Beyond its ugliness, we know 
that litter negatively impacts our envi-
ronment and our health. Plastic waste 
can break down into tiny pieces called 
microplastics, which then permeate 
our soil and infiltrate our drinking 
water. From there, microplastics inev-
itably enter the bodies of all animals 
— including you and me! That means 
that you have plastic in you at this 
very moment. In fact, in several recent 
studies, Americans were found to 
have microplastics embedded in every 
major organ, and according to Nation-
al Geographic, humans are consum-
ing about 1,000 pieces of microplastic 
every week (the equivalent of eating 
an entire credit card) — and that’s not 
even counting the plastics we inhale. 
This shouldn’t come as a surprise. As 
you walk through campus, try count-
ing how many pieces of plastic you 
come into contact with in a single day. 
Our food is wrapped in plastic, our 
clothes are made of plastic and there’s 

plastic in the air we breathe. Some-
thing must be done to clean up our 
campus.

In response to the looming threat of 

ecological disaster, LSA Student Gov-

ernment has created the Campus Con-
servation Corps, reviving the mission 
of the original Civilian Conservation 
Corps. Our initiative aims to organize 
students to finally clean up the litter 

flooding our city. However, the scope 
of the Student Government’s CCC 
extends far beyond our campus clean-
up project. The CCC plans to protect 
our local environment by removing 
invasive species from nature pre-
serves and planting native Michigan 
plants like carrots, blueberries and 
black-eyed Susans in community gar-
dens. The CCC will also be partnering 
with the Ann Arbor City Council to 
take on many important conserva-
tion tasks in our city that often go 
neglected due to a lack of volunteers. 
We’re joined in these efforts by repre-
sentatives from Central Student Gov-
ernment and Engineering Student 
Government as we bring together 
voices and minds from across the Uni-
versity of Michigan to save and beau-
tify our environment. 

But we can’t accomplish this work 

alone, and that’s why we are asking for 
your help.

Many people, including myself, 

define themselves differently after 
the past year. As things return to 
normal, I can only wonder how to 
move forward. A few months ago 
on TikTok, there was a trend where 
creators would lip-sync to an audio 
of Dr. Umar Johnson asking, “What 
happened to the original plot of the 
movie?” while adding text over their 
videos that described how their life 
trajectory changed entirely due to the 
pandemic. This trend was popular 
because it was relatable — different 
relationships, gender identities and 
sexual orientations, academic inter-
ests, living situations and much more 
revealed themselves to many over the 
course of the lockdown, seemingly 
out of left field. 

Defining oneself has always been 

essential. As humans, especially ones 
finding our place in the world, it feels 
integral to know our identities and 
how they fit into society. You need 
to have an elevator pitch about your-
self because when an interviewer, a 
club application or a person at a party 
says, “Tell me about yourself!” you 
need something to say. In her speech, 
“Learning from the 60s,” Audre 
Lorde said, “if I didn’t define myself 
for myself, I would be crunched into 

other people’s fantasies for me and 
eaten alive.” And so, many were — in 
attempts to own our narratives, we 
adopted labels and conventions that 
we didn’t stop to evaluate. 

However, when the pandemic hap-

pened and people were left without 
the constant policing of society, they 
began to redefine themselves on their 
own terms. Now, more than a year 
later, restrictions are loosening, and 
it’s almost time to return to regular 
social interaction. What now?

I entered the University of Michi-

gan at the beginning of August 2020, 
eager to major in environmental 
engineering. Now, I am decidedly not 
pursuing engineering for my under-
graduate degree (not out of dislike for 
the department — after much reflec-
tion during the lockdown, I’ve found 
that my interests lie elsewhere). It’s 
daunting to float untethered, but it’s 
a step forward from lying to myself 
about what I’m interested in. My 
major was the easiest thing on the list 
to decide, and now, without one, I’ll 
show up to classes next year unsure 
of my interests or identity. But after 
seeing the alternative — convincing 
myself to follow something I’m not 
interested in — I’m thankful for the 
opportunity to question the rest of my 

life. 

How we define ourselves has 

changed over the last year due to time 
spent away from those outside of our 
bubbles. However, when addressing 
the pandemic, it’s integral to remem-
ber that not all, or even most, change 
has been positive. Lockdown affected 
different groups unequally — many 
people have been altered by grief, 
loneliness and anxiety, and some 
much more than others. Not everyone 
was in a place where they could “find 
themselves” — many had to worry 
about simply surviving and keeping 
their families alive instead. To act 
as if this pandemic was ultimately a 
“learning experience” while brush-
ing the traumatic experiences of mil-
lions under the rug would be elitist; 
being able to “discover yourself” is a 
privilege. The way powerful universi-
ties handled crises involving gradu-
ate students and underrepresented 
groups, such as students of color and 
low-income students, during the pan-
demic is something we must keep in 
mind as we move forward.

With the scandals that many insti-

tutions have gone through in the past 
year alone, it feels odd to accept estab-
lishments as a part of one’s identity. 
Additionally, it was much easier to

How Can I Extend an Olive Branch?

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Palestine. The Holy Land. An 

ancient motherland, where every 
nook and cranny possesses a piece of 
sacred history. Home of the olive tree 
— a renowned symbol of peace and 
tranquility yet trampled in the face of 
oppression. A centuries old fruit bearer, 
ripped from its roots, as though it holds 
no weight, no meaning. 

I’ve been lucky enough to be allowed 

entry into my beautiful homeland four 
times before. I was very young the first 
time and didn’t know much, but I could 
see the guns and tanks everywhere we 
went and hear the innocent children 
as they screamed at soldiers to put 
them down. After crossing the Allenby 
bridge at the Jordanian border and 
waiting for over a day at military 
checkpoints in the occupied West Bank 
with nausea sweeping over me through 
the countless bumpy bus rides, we had 
finally arrived at my grandparents’ 
house in the small village of Kifl 
Haris. They immediately greeted 
me: my sitti with her warm embrace, 
and my sido lifting me up into the air 
while screams of joy escaped me, my 
fatigue superseded by the excitement 
of seeing my estranged family. When 
he finally put me down, the sound of 
a small kitten drew me near the back 
of the house. In an attempt to follow 
the soft purrs, I stumbled upon their 
colorful garden, pervaded by plants I 
did not know the names of. Treading 
through the greens with careful steps, 
the leaves of the fruits and flowers 

brushed over the back of my hand, 
tickling me as though they longed for 
the presence of a child in their midst. 
Using one of the purple plastic chairs 
lying on the back deck, I stood to 
reach grape vines hanging above me 
and climbed trees to pluck sweet figs 
and bitter pomegranates. My arms 
overflowing with fruit and with a kitten 
in tow, I emerged 15 minutes later with 
the biggest smile plastered onto my 
face. Seeing how much I adored their 
garden, my grandparents were excited 
to introduce me to their eminent glory: 
their olive tree groves. After freshening 
up, we all piled into my grandpa’s 
ten-year-old Volkswagen that rattled 
at every turn. As we drove the short 
distance together, I was awestruck by 
the majestic mountains that crowned 
the landscape and the palm trees that 
lined the streets. Children played 
soccer with a makeshift ball while 
soldiers strapped with AK47s loomed 
in the background.

As we approached our destination, 

I nearly jumped out of the moving 
car as I got a glimpse of what awaited 
me. The beautiful earthy green field 
was filled with olive trees standing 
tall, laden with olives and stretching 
beyond the corners of my eyes. Waving 
at me in the breeze, they begged me to 
climb up their strong limbs and pluck 
their olives gently. For the second time 
that day, I was completely blown away 
by the scene that surrounded me. As I 
ran towards the first tree I laid eyes on, 
standing on my tiptoes to reach the tall 
branches, my sido hauled me up on his 
shoulders. While I struggled to grab 
as many as I could, my sido grabbed 

my wrist and set me back down. He 
explained why we don’t pick olives one 
by one — there are simply too many of 
them on each tree. Instead, with his 
instruction, we spread out a few white 
cloth sheets underneath the tree. As my 
sido beat the olive tree with his wooden 
cane, 
the 
sheet-covered 
ground 

beneath us quickly filled with black and 
green olives. While I sorted through 
the ripe black olives and put away the 
firm green ones that still had to be 
cured, the olives gleamed under the 
scorching sun. I suddenly wondered 
if my ancestors also experienced this 
feeling of inner peace at this very spot 
while they sorted through olives like 
me. 

While we worked, my sido told me 

stories about the history of the land: 
ancient prophets who roamed the 
lush fields centuries ago, the religious 
significance of the monotheistic faiths 
associated with the region and the 
Crusades that were fought not far from 
where we were standing. His face was 
overtaken with a childlike marvel 
when describing the spiritual aura 
surrounding the Al-Aqsa mosque and 
golden Dome of Rock, but the light in 
his eyes dimmed when he mentioned 
the Gaza Strip, which was still under 
complete siege. This meant that little 
kids like me had restricted access to 
clean water to wash their favorite 
shirts or take baths with their toys. 
They were forbidden from getting too 
close to the beach, even on a bright 
summer day. They were denied usage 
of electricity to watch TV as their 
family shared breakfast or stay up late 
to play computer games. They were 

barred from traveling for vacations or 
leaving Gaza to visit family. They were 
strippedof the opportunity to grow up 
and attend college or carry dreams for 
their future. As I listened to my sido in 
silence, blood rushed to my head and 
tears welled up in my eyes. I gripped 
each olive harder, afraid that they 
would fall out of my trembling hands 
and smash on the ground. How could 
the world remain silent as children 
suffered under such brutal conditions? 
How could a land famous for its olive 
trees not know peace? 

The 
answer: 
settler-colonialism 

in all its glory. Settler-colonialism is 
a distinct form of colonialism that 
seeks to uproot and dispossess the 
Indigenous population of a desired 
land, replacing them with a new group 
of colonizing settlers, while ruling over 
the remaining Indigenous peoples 
through an imperialist authoritative 
structure. The state of Israel is, in 
fact, a settler-colony, and its Zionist 
ideology is rooted in the dispossession 
and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian 
people. Israel’s propaganda machine, 
however, supervises and censors raw 
footage, presenting the world with 
a one-sided narrative while giving 
no room for Palestinian voices to be 
heard. It has painted a picture in which 
colonized Palestinians are the sole 
aggressors, leaving the poor colonizer 
Israel, the principal nuclear power in 
the Middle East, with no choice but to 
defend itself. Part of Israel’s dangerous 
rhetoric to depict itself as the victim 
is through an intentional conflation 
of anti-Zionism with antisemitism. 
This draws sympathy and unwavering 

support for Israel from the Western 
world, rendering it nearly impossible 
to criticize Israel and its use of brute 
force against Palestinians without 
being labeled an antisemite. 

So, how then, can I tell my side of 

the story without being silenced? How 
can I appeal to a Western audience 
who is already dead set on the fact 
that I belong to a group of savage 
terrorists and convince them of my 
right to freely exist? Is the only way I 
have to tell my story through the lens 
of an innocent happy child spending 
time with her grandparents, picking 
fruits and olives? Must I always 
omit the gruesome details of settler-
colonialism and the constant threat of 
dispossession in favor of descriptions 
of pretty scenery? Can I only garner 
support for my dignity by slipping 
in the subtleties of living under an 
excruciatingly 
violent 
military 

occupation with a smile on my face? 
Why is it expected that I accept the 
subjugation with my head low to 
avoid upsetting my oppressor and its 
supporters?

How can I remain silent when an 

apartheid power is actively profiting 
off of the conquest of my land? How 
can I be asked to “understand both 
sides” when a colonizer still denies me 
access to the land my ancestors called 
home less than 73 years ago? How can I 
extend an olive branch to an oppressor 
who consistently denies my existence 
and tries to erase my story?

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com MICHIGAN IN COLOR

There we sat in her childhood 

bedroom. Except it was no longer 
purple like mine. In fact, it felt like her 
entire house changed. New pictures 
on the walls, new appliances in her 
kitchen. I felt like a stranger in the 
house I grew up going to every day. 

You never realize you start to drift 

away from someone you love until 
you reconnect and rekindle the old 
flame. This feeling hit me recently as I 
started seeing my best friend from my 
childhood more often this past week. 

We’d been best friends since fourth 

grade. Every day we would ring each 
other’s doorbells to ask if we could 
play outside, sleepover at each other’s 
houses every weekend, sit next to each 
other on the school bus every morning, 
go on walks together every day, gush 
over cute boys in our classes, paint each 
other’s nails, anything and everything 
you would think a pair of best friends 
would do. We’re going to be best 
friends forever. It felt like I had found 
my person. Imagine lighting a match 
and immediately seeing the flame 
appear, how bright that flame shines 
— that’s how the friendship felt. Bright 
and exciting.

High school came around, and 

suddenly we were no longer at each 
other’s houses every day. We weren’t 
texting each other everyday, playing 
outside, going on walks, talking about 
our crushes, painting each other’s nails. 
There wasn’t any of that anymore. 
We were still friends, don’t get me 
wrong, but the flame was starting to 
burn out right in front of us. Looking 
back, I never knew what triggered the 
flame to start dwindling. Some days 
I think to myself that maybe it was 
because we both got busy with school, 
applying to college, clubs and other 
extracurricular activities. Plus, she was 
a year older than me, so there was no 
way we’d even be in the same classes. 
Other days I think it was because we 
met new people. Again, both of us 
were in different grades and made 
friends in our own classes. We wanted 
to strengthen our relationships with 
other people since ours had always 
been solid. Not knowing, for me, is the 
worst part. Why did the flame start 
to die out? It’s almost impossible to 
pinpoint when and why exactly things 
started drifting apart. 

Then we both got to college. I 

moved to Ann Arbor, and she moved 
to Mount Pleasant. We rarely texted 
each other, rarely were home on the 
same weekends. She just turned into 
someone I followed on Instagram, 
someone who would slide up on my 

Snapchat stories. The flame was on its 
last legs. Again, we both were college 
students living in different cities, and 
we needed time for our work and our 
extracurriculars. We also needed time 
to strengthen the relationships we 
were creating in our new homes. Still, 
I was hopeful the flame would persist.

But the match completely burned 

out. The flame was dead. 

I kept telling myself that we were 

on good terms, we were just busy. 
I was making excuses to myself 
that everything was fine with our 
friendship when in reality we were 
turning into strangers right before our 
eyes. The reality of it didn’t hit me until 
all of a sudden she was in a relationship, 
and I found out through Instagram. 
Don’t get me wrong, I was happy for 
her, but I felt like that was something 
you would tell your friend in person 
instead of finding out by watching an 
Instagram story. I couldn’t be mad at 
her though because I caught myself 
doing the same thing. I started trying 
new things, meeting new people and 
immediately showed the world on 
social media. I didn’t text her anything 
about what was happening in my life 
and she didn’t text me anything about 
what was going on with her. We met 
new people, made new inside jokes 
with them, went on trips without each 
other and listened to different music. 

We weren’t the ones in each other’s 
houses every weekend anymore. 

The flame stayed dead. The most 

contact we had with each other was via 
social media, just viewing each other’s 
pictures, stalking the new friends 
we’re tagging, occasionally sliding 
up on each other’s stories. It wasn’t 
until the pandemic hit that we started 
talking to each other again. Out of the 
blue, she invited me to spend the night 
at her house, just like old times. I was 
hesitant, of course. I didn’t know what 
to think of it. But we both had tested 
negative for COVID and were both 
free that weekend. Plus, we were still 
each other friends, albeit, or at least 
acquaintances. I decided to go, and 
immediately I felt out of place. Her 
house looked completely different, so 
unlike the home I spent every weekend 
at in fourth grade. But the night 
progressed, and I slowly started feeling 
comfortable again. The hours kept 
passing by, and we started opening up. 
We started with the shallow stuff: “I 
tried a new restaurant!” “I went to my 
first college football game!” And then 
it all vomited out of us. Everything we 
hadn’t told each other came spewing 
out of each of us. By the end of it all, 
we were in tears. She looked at me and 
said “Smarani, I thought you hated 
me.” I started sobbing even more. How 
could I hate you? If only you knew the 

number of nights I’ve stayed up tossing 
and turning, wondering what went 
wrong, and why I couldn’t manage 
to keep the flame. The number of 
sleepless nights I’ve spent silently 
shedding tears because I missed my 
best friend. The only words I managed 
to get out were “I thought you hated 
me.” We embraced each other, our 
tears staining each other’s shirts. I 
was able to get a good night’s sleep that 
night. 

It’s impossible to relight a match 

that has been burned out. In the same 
way it’s impossible to ever go back to 
the stage of friendship we were once 
at. We had drifted so far apart that 
at this rate, who knows how long it 
would be until we were back. The fact 
that we’re getting older doesn’t help 
either. She’s getting ready to relocate 
for an internship. I’m working on my 
passion projects and taking classes 
over the summer. It’s a hard pill to 
swallow. But we’re both ready to try 
and take the baby steps necessary to 
get as close as we can to where we once 
were. Although we’ve grown up to be 
different now, we both want to go back 
to how it once was. Back to talking 
about our crushes again, taking trips 
together, sharing our music and going 
back to spending every weekend at 
each other’s houses.

A few hundred Dearborn resi-

dents came together outside of the 
Dearborn Police Department on Fri-
day evening for a candlelight vigil to 
show their support and mourning for 
the people of Palestine. Organized by 
Dearborn resident and activist Laila 
Abunab-Elabed, the event called for 
peace and liberation in Palestine. 

As the crowd formed, children 

were invited to gather in front where 
they each received a paper sign to 
wear. The signs each read the name 
and age of a child killed by airstrikes 
in Palestine. A few dozen children 
ranging from toddlers to teenagers 
stood in front of the crowd quietly, 
with many turning to wave at parents 
and smile for pictures.

“I have all of you guys behind me,” 

Abunab-Elabed said to the crowd as 
the group of children formed in front 
of her. “I have all of you guys behind 
this community and a community 
that is behind humanity.”

Dearborn lawyer and poet Has-

san Salamey stood with the children 
while he read a poem and prayer to 
the crowd. “In order for you to jour-
ney with me,” Salamey began, “I need 
you all to close your eyes, take four 
deep breaths.”

As the crowd stood and listened 

with their eyes closed, Salamey 
spoke on the importance of unity 
and understanding between various 
faiths and backgrounds. His poem 
continued, “Tonight we stand as the 
unified children of Abraham, as the 
sons and daughters of Muhammad, 
Moses and Jesus.”

He closed with a prayer in Arabic, 

before leading the crowd in a moment 
of silence.

Following Salamey’s reading, the 

children returned to their families 
as attendees helped each other light 
their candles one by one. 

Abunab-Elabed spoke once more 

as the candles were lit, emphasizing 
the importance of youth in the com-
munity. “Your children are going to 
be able to tell these stories,” Abunab-
Elabed said, “You are instilling such 
a beautiful tradition into them. They 
are going to grow up and be even 
stronger, and then their children will 
be even stronger.”

The crowd stood silently with 

their candles for several minutes, 
before beginning chants of “free, free 
Palestine!” and “end the occupation!”, 
led by Salamey’s young daughter.

As the vigil wrapped up with clos-

ing words from Salamey and Abunab-
Elabed, as organizers arranged small 
candles reading “Palestine” on the 
ground where the group of children 
had stood before. These candles were 
lit as the event wrapped up and con-
tinued to burn while attendees slowly 
dispersed.

Community members march to remember George Floyd

One year after the murder of 

George Floyd, community members 
gathered in Ann Arbor to protest 
against police brutality and system-
ic racism Wednesday afternoon.

Protesters 
marched 
down 

Washtenaw Avenue to the Washt-
enaw County Sheriff’s Office where 
they joined hands in solidarity and 
sang in memory of George Floyd 
and other victims of police brutal-
ity both nationally and locally.

The protesters then took a knee 

at the Hogback Road intersection 
for 9 minutes and 29 seconds — the 
amount of time former Minneapolis 
police officer Derek Chauvin knelt 
on Floyd’s neck. Protesters were 
joined by Matthew Harshberger, 
the director of public safety In 
Pittsfield Charter Township, who 
took a knee in solidarity.

Following the march was an 

open mic where members of the 
community shared their thoughts. 
Among those who spoke were orga-
nizer Machelle Pearson, activist 
Leslie Windless, and Washtenaw 
County prosecutor Eli Savit.

“A Quiet Place Part II” struggles in comparison to its predecessor

Album Review: Bruiser Brigade - TV62

After over a year-long break 

from movie theaters, I went to see 
“A Quiet Place Part II,” thoroughly 
expecting my first foray back into the 
theater to be an enjoyable experience. 
Unfortunately, “A Quiet Place Part II” 
disappointed. 

To be fair, I had high expectations. 

The first film was thrilling (even to 
someone like me who usually can’t 
handle scary movies and jump scares). 
Writer and director John Krasinski 
(“The Office”) had a lot of interesting 
reasons to make a sequel and I wanted 
more than anything to have my first 
back-in-the-theaters film blow my 
mind. 

But “A Quiet Place Part II” just 

seemed to be missing something — 

and I’m pretty sure that missing piece 
was John Krasinski’s character, Lee. 
The film opened with a flashback 
from before the events of the first film, 
which captured my attention quickly. 
Having seen the first film and knowing 
all too well the importance of sound 
and silence, I was hyper-aware of every 
single noise I heard in the film — Lee’s 
footsteps, the rustling of a plastic bag, 
the hum of the news on a television, 
the sounds of an idyllic kids’ baseball 
game. I was enthralled by this scene 
that seemed to be the antithesis of “A 
Quiet Place”’s dark, muted tones and 
nearly complete silence. Too quickly, 
though, the film reverted back to 
where the end of the first film left off — 
with Lee’s family trekking through the 
woods in silence and trying to survive 
the attacks of the monsters (or aliens?) 
that were attracted to sound. 

In many ways, this film was too 

similar to the first, making it feel like an 
unnecessary addition or extension of a 
film that ended on a pretty good note. 
On top of that, the characters were 
too unbelievable, making it easy to fall 
out of the film’s world. Evelyn (Emily 
Blunt, “Mary Poppins Returns”) 
is still a caring mother in an awful 
situation, trying to help her kids in the 
best way she can. However, she makes 
decisions that are completely out of 
character for a mother putting her 
children first. Her eldest son, Marcus 
(Noah Jupe, “Wonder”) is as timid as 
he was in the first film, but seemed to 
make worse decisions than he had in 
“A Quiet Place,” including leaving his 
baby sibling alone in order to explore 
his new ‘home.’ Regan (Millicent 
Simmonds, “Wonderstruck”) struck 
out on her own to try to save her 
family (although it’s not made entirely 
clear how she planned to do that). 

Simmonds’s performance, enhanced 
by her communication through sign 
language, is moving, just as it was in 
the original film, but her character’s 
flawed 
decision-making 
made 
it 

difficult to pay attention to anything 
else. 

Finally, the new addition to the 

“Quiet Place” cast, Emmett (Cillian 
Murphy, “Inception”) is perhaps 
the most confusing part of the 
film. Presumably present to fill 
John Krasinski’s character’s shoes, 
Emmett tries to help the struggling 
family survive. But his character’s 
inconsistencies are too difficult to 
ignore; he starts out willing to sacrifice 
the family for his own benefit and safety, 
and ends up being Regan’s greatest 
ally. The shift in character comes too 
quickly and thus feels unrealistic and 
unbelievable. Murphy’s performance 
as Emmet is good — commendable, 

even — but the role was written in 
a way that made it difficult for the 
audience to garner any sympathy for 
him or see him as anything more than 
a poor man’s substitute for Krasinski’s 
heartfelt performance as Lee.

If you enjoy the suspense and jump 

scares that a film like “A Quiet Place” 
offers, you’ll probably enjoy the sequel 
whilst watching it. But the second 
the credits start rolling and you start 
actually thinking about what you just 
watched, it all falls to pieces. 

In all honesty, this film didn’t need 

to be made. Perhaps the anticipation 
that the film’s various release dates 
created made people’s expectations 
even higher, ensuring that any version 
of “A Quiet Place Part II” would fall flat, 
but I can’t help but think that with the 
way the first film ended, any attempt to 
continue the storyline and expand the 
universe would end on a sour note. 

Detroit-based rap group Bruiser 

Brigade are virtuosos of immersive 
hip-hop. Led by rapper Danny 
Brown since 2012, the collective 
weaves the narratives of what may 
appear to be disparate musical 
talents into a thoroughly enjoyable 
listening experience. 

On 
their 
sophomore 
album, 

TV62, released earlier this month on 
Bandcamp, the group continues to 
flex their knack for storytelling. The 
16-track amalgamation of Detroit 
hip-hop veterans and rising stars 
alike teems with humor and biting 
tales of hard-edged upbringings and 
life experiences. Following their first 
unofficial album, Reign Supreme, 
streamed in 2018 exclusively on 
the gaming platform Twitch, TV62 
welcomes back old talents from its 
previous project like Danny Brown, 
Fat Ray and ZelooperZ, while 
opening the door to newer features 
like J.U.S and Bruiser Wolf. Unlike 
Reign Supreme, which incorporated 
Brown’s iconic animated flow on 
almost every song, Bruiser Brigade’s 
latest album takes on a more even-
handed distribution of airtime. Yet 
the group’s dedication to painting 
vivid portraits of Detroit street 
life and the city’s storied cultural 
richness remains unchanged. 

In its opening clip, TV62 begins 

with an audio snippet from a 

WGPR-TV 
announcement, 
the 

first Black-owned TV station in 
the United States, based in Detroit 
and serving as the inspiration for 
the project’s title. The following 
track, “The Dopest in the Building,” 
follows Bruiser Wolf and his trials 
with drugs and poverty. Wolf’s 
delivery may be cartoonish, but 
his subject matter is anything but. 
He details the cyclic nature of 
drug dealing and addiction with a 
sunny timbre, quipping, “Product 
of my environment / Victim of 
circumstance / Supply it if you buy 
it, from bricks to grams.” 

Although arguably the most 

vocally similar to Brown, Wolf 
etches 
out 
his 
own 
path 
of 

unorthodox delivery nonetheless. 
Wolf brings his sharp wit to the 
table as well, supplying some of the 
funnier lines on the album. On the 
track “Your Gone,” he references a 
sinister yet memorable Michigan 
news story from last year, rapping, 
“plottin’on a white girl like them 
guys that tried to kidnap Whitmer.” 
Wolf’s dark repartee and balanced 
staccato mannerisms separate him 
from his peers, further reinforcing 
Bruiser Brigade’s ability to shine 
light on its individual talents without 
sacrificing the connectedness of the 
wider project. 

Fat Ray, a seasoned professional 

in Detroit’s underground rap scene, 
delivers his own distinctive flow on 
tracks like “Superhero” and “Juice.” 
With 
a 
more 
straightforward 

delivery, 
Ray’s 
smooth 
babble 

mirrors the classic narrative-heavy 
nature of ‘90s hip-hop, a contrast 
that works surprisingly well with the 
more experimental idiosyncrasies of 
Brown and ZelooperZ. 

On the tracks “Dylon,” “Welfare” 

and “The Ends,” Danny Brown 
reminds the listener of his ability 
to deliver masterfully weird and 
often 
crude 
commentary. 
The 

entire project drips with Brown’s 
avant 
garde 
instrumentation 

style, with clear parallels to his 
sixth and most recent solo release, 
uknowhatimsayin¿. Perhaps one of 
these moments unique to Brown on 
the album is the final track, “The 
Ends,” which can only be explained 
as Renaissance Faire meets sleek 
hip-hop funk — who knew a flute 
could go so hard?

Brown collects an executive 

production credit on TV62, and 
there’s no doubt that his influence 
seeps into the project’s sonic 
developments 
as 
well 
as 
the 

establishment 
of 
the 
Brigade’s 

physical body of members. Yet 
Brown is not the singular voice 
shining on the album, making it 
clear to the listener that Bruiser 
Brigade is very much a collective 
effort. 

Intermittent clips of laughter and 

lively conversation among Brigade 
members throughout the project 
only adds to the obvious chemistry 
between the artists. It’s as if the 
listeners have been welcomed into 

the studio themselves, the mic 
traveling around in a circle to catch 
energetic freestyles and raunchy 
jokes alike. Afterall, a group that 
could think of the line, “All my 
rules scientific, bitch feed me Fig 
Newtons,” has to have some kind 
of wildly entertaining brainstorm 
sessions going on behind the scenes. 

TV62 is personal and carefree 

rapping at its finest. Yet even with its 
easy-going undercurrent, it remains 
a disarmingly witty and technically 

polished 
project. 
With 
the 

establishment of Bruiser Brigade 
Records earlier this year, members 
like J.U.S, Bruiser Wolf and Fat Ray 
have released critically successful 
solo projects alongside their work 
with the Brigade. It’s apparent that 
Bruiser Brigade represents a new 
chapter not only in the musical 
endeavors of its members, but in the 
wider bounds of a hip-hop world 
seeking autonomy and untethered 
creativity.

Humans have told stories since 

we invented language and art, 
but the history of storytelling has 
reached new heights in the last 
forty years thanks to a complex, 
marvelous technological invention: 
video games. Video games combine 
art, music, performance, science, 
and perhaps most important of 
all, writing. There is an endless 
list of video games that have been 
praised for their creative methods 
of storytelling, but one genre is at 
last rising in popularity and gaining 
respect in the gaming community: 
visual novels.

Visual novels consist of text 

accompanied by character portraits 
and static backgrounds. There is 
minimal gameplay, usually only 
involving choosing dialogue which 
determines the direction of the 
branching storyline. Many visual 
novels also include point-and-click 
elements for exploring the setting of 
the game. It’s becoming increasingly 
common for visual novels to include 
minigames, like the bartending 
element of Sukeban Games’ “VA-11 
HALL-A” or the real-time shooting 
sections of Kazutaka Kodaka’s 
Danganronpa 
series. 
Ultimately, 

what lies at the heart of the visual 
novel is the ability to not just read or 

watch a narrative, but interact with 
it.

I’ve been a fan of the genre since 

I first played “Phoenix Wright: Ace 
Attorney” on my Nintendo DS as a 
kid. I was a voracious reader who 
tore through stacks of books at my 
local library, but nothing held my 
attention as well as a game that 
allowed me to become a central part 
of the action. I was never the most 
skilled when it came to real-time 
action in games (and to this day 

I’m still more puzzle and strategy 
oriented), but that’s what hooked me 
about this genre — it was accessible, 
but just as exciting as any book or 
video game.

Complexity and skill level are 

often used to separate “real” gamers 
from the rest of the pack. Similarly, 
simplicity is used as an insult against 
readers. In a class with my fellow 
English majors, I’m far less likely to 
gain respect by making comparisons 
to the Twilight series or “The 
Fault in Our Stars” than if I were 
to discuss “A Farewell to Arms” or 
“Moby Dick.” Some visual novels are 
written with the intent of not being 
taken seriously, such as the dating 
simulation 
“Hatoful 
Boyfriend” 

in which all romance options are 
pigeons. Others are just as sincere 
and contemplative as the novels I’ve 
been required to study. 

What makes a story worthy of the 

label “great literature?” If it’s the 

level of complexity, then “To Kill a 
Mockingbird” would not be held in 
as high regard as “Finnegans Wake.” 
Complexity alone is not the measure 
of 
what 
is 
deemed 
literature; 

enjoyment and depth are equally 
important. By this logic, visual 
novels (due to their focus on text) 
should easily fit in this category. 
History shows us that as technology 
advances, the boundaries between 
mediums blur, as do the benchmarks 
of value. 

A prime example of this in recent 

memory is developer Vanillaware’s 
2019 visual novel “13 Sentinels: Aegis 
Rim.” It was praised by the biggest 
outlets in gaming journalism and 
nominated for awards across the 
world for its exceptional non-linear 
storytelling. In fact, it was the only 
video game nominated for the 51st 
Seiun Awards, a long-running award 
for the best Japanese science fiction. 
If a game of this genre is deemed 
important enough to be nominated 
for an award typically only given 
to literature and films, should the 
genre not be taken more seriously as 
an art form?

The genre’s history can be 

traced all the way back to the early 
1980s, but until recently it has been 
considered very niche. Nintendo 
was one of the first big names to 
influence the genre with 1983’s 
“Portopia Serial Murder Case” on 
the Famicom console. They were also 

the first to bring the genre into the 
mainstream with the Ace Attorney 
and Professor Layton series on the 
Nintendo DS. Though they continue 
to be developed more often by indie 
developers 
than 
large 
studios, 

visual novels now rank among the 
top selling games of the Nintendo 
Switch, 
Steam 
and 
Playstation 

stores. Elements of visual novels can 
also be found in many successful 
games today outside of the genre; 
the social aspects of “Fire Emblem: 
Three Houses” and “Persona 5” are 
some of the most enjoyable sections 
of the games, both of which have 
sold millions of copies. 

It’s encouraging to see visual 

novels on the rise as they are 
finally being appreciated as the 
thoughtful pieces of art that they 
are. It’s challenging enough to 
write 
something 
engaging, 
but 

add in animation, a soundtrack 
and interactivity and something 
singularly 
creative 
is 
born. 

Regardless of content, visual novels 
open the door for creators to craft 
a narrative without the limitations 
other forms possess. As the genre 
gains 
popularity 
with 
serious 

gamers and newcomers alike, it 
simply makes sense to consider 
this an exciting step in humanity’s 
constant search for the best way to 
share stories. 

Preserving Humanity on Campus

Last 
weekend, 
almost 
three 

thousand protestors mobilized in 
Ann Arbor to rally for the Palestinian 
people and shed light on this 
terrible humanitarian crisis. The 
consequence of highly controversial 
issues is that the humanity of the 
victims of injustice is ignored. 
Their worth is stripped down by 
the dehumanizing and apathetic 
debates we are surrounded by. For 
this reason, seeing protestors on 
the Michigan campus brought me a 
surge of hope. At my college, on my 
campus, in my community, we were 
able to preserve the humanity of a 
people that has been silenced, and 
consequently, we are able to hope for 
a brighter future. To see thousands 

of people mobilize in Ann Arbor 
brings me hope, and I can only pray 
it brings solace to the Palestinians 
who are suffering right now. 

In an increasingly connected 

world, we bear witness to millions of 
atrocities and humanitarian crises 
all over the world. From our backyard 
to halfway across the world, there is 
widespread inequality and injustice. 
It’s easy to get lost in politics and 
ignore what doesn’t directly concern 
us. But in doing so, we invalidate the 
struggle of a whole group of people 
and diminish their worth. In a 
world with almost 8 billion people, 
come 8 billion reasons to hope for 
justice, peace, and equality. Global 
humanity needs to be preserved. We 
need to empathize with the victims 
of injustice and hold the people in 
power accountable. 

It 
has 
become 
abundantly 

clear to me that the University of 
Michigan campus is a core location 
for movements to mobilize and 
organize. It is on this campus that 
people protest, strike, and demand 
accountability from the people in 
power. It is on this campus where we 
can, and should, preserve humanity. 
It is among the thousands of students 
where conversations are started and 
where empathy is fostered. 

This year, my bedroom has been 

my classroom — my college has been 
a desk in the corner, a laptop, my 
niche habitat. It’s been difficult to 
imagine myself as a part of a wider 
student community, as engaged 
in the different events on campus. 
Despite this, I was able to participate 
in important conversations, from the 
comfort of my bedroom. In the first 
few months of my freshman year, 
the graduate students (graduate 

students employees organization) 
went on strike. I clearly remember 
each 
of 
my 
graduate 
student 

instructors actively discussing their 
position with us, what they were 
fighting for, and who they were 
doing it for: us, the student body. 
There were many ways in which I 
could participate remotely, such as 
attending “zoom strike meetings.” 
Although their demands were not 
met, I felt incredibly affirmed that 
there are people who care about the 
same things I do and are working to 
make the campus a more accepting 
place for all.

We come to college for education; 

this includes what we can learn from 
activism, raising awareness, and 
starting important conversations. 
Protests, rallying, and mobilization 
is ingrained in college culture 
and crucial to preserving and 

maintaining our humanity. The 
University of Michigan plays its 
fair part in these conversations and 
movements. 

This upcoming fall we will all 

(hopefully) be physically present, 
thus, directly interacting with each 
other. This begs the question: how 
will we continue to use our positions 
to support different movements, to 
rally and mobilize? 

In light of this, let’s make the 

conscious 
decision 
to 
choose 

benevolence over violence, to choose 
empathy over division. Let’s use our 
positions, big or small, to be open-
minded, learn what we can, and in 
the process, preserve our collective 
humanity.

STATEMENT

“The COVID transition: Summer travel, social activities 

and masks

Over late night cups of tea during 

finals season, one of my housemates 
and I discussed our hopes and 
plans for the summer. She would 
be vacationing in Florida with her 
boyfriend and going on a trip home to 
Seattle. The talk of travel and social 
activities was exciting; however, 
there was a lingering uncertainty 
about just how “normal” life would 
be during the summer. When I 
described my hopes to be back in The 
Big House by next fall, my housemate 
admitted that she wasn’t sure when 
she would feel fully comfortable in 
crowds again, even though she is fully 
vaccinated.

Less than one month later, new 

public 
health 
guidelines 
have 

equipped us with more knowledge 
on what this summer will look like 
and how to navigate travel and social 
activities. On May 13, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
announced that in most cases, fully 
vaccinated people no longer need to 
practice social distancing or mask-
wearing. For U-M students, there 
is a clashing mix of excitement and 
apprehension surrounding the shift 
in guidelines, particularly concerning 
what it means for returning to a sense 
of normalcy in time for summer 

vacation.

I talked to several students to hear 

their thoughts surrounding travel 
and social activities this summer. 
Is there a hesitance to go back to 
things like concerts and parties, as 
my housemate expressed in our 
conversation nearly a month ago? Or 
are students ready to get back into 
the world with full force? I expected 
to hear a mixture of enthusiasm 
and hope for post-COVID life, but 
I was also prepared to encounter 
some concerns or anxiety about the 
transition.

LSA 
senior 
Sophie 
Einbund 

described 
feeling 
immense 

excitement for her travel plans in the 
upcoming months, though she also 
expressed some uneasiness over the 
balance between having fun with 
being safe and responsible.

“I don’t get too nervous when it 

comes to traveling, but I guess in 
terms of traveling during COVID-19, 
it is somewhat nerve-wracking even 
though I’m vaccinated,” Einbund said 
during our Zoom conversation. “It is 
frustrating to wear a mask and hope 
that other people are vaccinated as 
well.”

In July, she plans on going to Miami 

with a friend, and in August her family 

is flying to Hawaii. She mentioned 
that Florida will most likely be a 
vacation hotspot, but she is hoping 
she will be protected from COVID-19 
after previously contracting the virus 
and more recently getting the vaccine. 

“I think I was pretty opposed to 

traveling when COVID started, but 
now that people … are vaccinated, 
or obviously more than prior stages 
when there were no vaccines, I 
definitely feel more comfortable 
traveling myself or for other people to 
travel,” Einbund said. 

Engineering junior Thomas Dokas 

also plans on traveling this summer. 
He will be visiting South Carolina 
with his family. 

“My 
entire 
family 
has 
been 

vaccinated, so we are mostly not 
concerned about it,” Dokas said. “But 
if any of us weren’t, then I think that 
would have become a big issue.”

 He and his family members 

are among the over 4 million 
Michiganders who have had at least 
the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 
For Dokas, being vaccinated plays 
a huge role in terms of safety and 
comfort with traveling. 

“Personally, 
I’m 
not 
terribly 

concerned about (traveling) because 
I know how to keep myself safe from 

that sort of thing,” Dokas said. “I’ve 
been doing it for over a year now, but 
it’ll be interesting to see how other 
people start to behave.”

On the flip side, LSA freshman 

Maggie 
Sterling 
questioned 
the 

necessity of travel in general. While 
she will be traveling from Texas to 
Michigan when classes start in the 
fall, she has her reservations. 

“Personally, I’m not traveling for 

unnecessary reasons just because 
it still seems crazy, and planes have 
these enclosed spaces,” Sterling said. 

These feelings, she noted, account 

for her own actions and concerns and 
not her judgment of others. 

“I have known friends and family 

that 
have 
traveled 
during 
the 

pandemic with unnecessary travel, 
and I definitely found it hard for me 
to tell them not to because everyone 
makes the decisions that they feel 
(are) best for themselves,” Sterling 
said.

As of right now, the CDC still 

requires face coverings for public 
transportation, including airplanes. 
Still, there could be some hesitance 
over such excursions. 

Dr. Jon Zelner, assistant professor 

of epidemiology at the University of 
Michigan School of Public Health, 

talked to me about his recent 
experience traveling to New York. 
Dr. Zelner is vaccinated, but with 
two young children not yet able to get 
vaccinated, there was added risk to 
consider. 

“I drove up there by myself because 

I was not comfortable getting on 
a plane,” he said. “I would be fully 
masked, but the idea of sitting in an 
airplane with lots of people in close 
proximity, I just couldn’t handle it 
and it didn’t feel safe yet, even though 
this is one of these things where it’s 
probably just fine.” 

Dr. Zelner emphasized it could be 

a difficult transition for some people, 
one that may just take time.

“Certainly a year and a half ago 

(safety measures) seemed like bizarre 
things to do, like to sit six feet apart 
and keep our mouths covered, or if 
you have somebody at your house and 
keep the windows open in the dead of 
winter … you know, all these things 
felt kind of apocalyptic,” Dr. Zelner 
continued. “And it’s nice to let them 
go, but I think they become such a 
habit that to just focus back on our 
lives can be hard to do.”

A faith of my own

The pages of the frayed old 

children’s book peek out of my 
nightstand, begging to be read once 
again. Prepared for the overflow 
of emotions and tears that I know 
are on their way, I wipe my eyes, 
put on my glasses and open the 
little white drawer. Inscribed on 
the inside of the book — written 
in my grandpa’s curly, comforting 
cursive — is a short poem: 

Dearest Emily,
May the wind be at your back,
Let no grass grow under your feet,
Spread your wings and learn to fly,
Let your boundary be the sky.
Thoughts with love from Aunt Liz 

My copy of the 1980 children’s 

book “The Paper Bag Princess” is 
only one of many my grandparents 
sent out. In an effort to send Liz’s 
love to a generation she will never 
meet, my grandparents mailed out 
copies of this feminist-in-training 
story to all of her friends as they 
had children. The story itself 
takes the classic fairytale and 
flips it on its head: when Princess 
Elizabeth’s husband-to-be Ronald 
is captured by a dragon, Elizabeth 
outsmarts the dragon, rescues her 
fiance and then proceeds to dump 
him because he’s honestly a real 

asshole (my words, not the book’s). 
She runs off into the sunset in her 
paper bag gown and scraggly tiara, 
joyful as can be. Elizabeth learns 
to fend for herself and realizes that 
she does not need a judgemental, 
snobby prince to keep her in line, 
for she is stronger than he will ever 
be. What makes her a princess is 
not the beautiful gown she wears 
and the massive castle she lives in, 
but her ability and drive to forge 
her own path. 

I tuck the book back into its 

crevice in my crowded drawer and 
finally get out of bed. We have to 
be at the temple in less than an 
hour, and I am nowhere near ready. 

My mom struggles to zip up the 

dress I swore still fit me, and to my 
own embarrassment, my 12-year-
old brother comes in to help her. 
Once it finally zips shut, I can 
feel my chest being pushed back 
into itself. It is unclear whether or 
not I will have the oxygen supply 
to make it through a two-hour 
service in this dress. One thing 
Liz and I do not happen to share 
is our cup size. But it once fit her, 
so I insist it will fit me. I slip into 
high heels that I cannot walk in 
and hobble out the door alongside 
my family. 

I have never had the privilege 

of meeting my Aunt Liz myself. 
What little I know about her 
comes from teary anecdotes told 
by my grandparents and old photo 
albums I can barely stomach 
looking through. I know much 
more about the pain my family 
endures having lost a loved one at 
the tragically young age of 28.

She was kind, and sensitive, 

and thoughtful, and much more. 
She went to Cornell and then 
Harvard to study public health 
in hopes of setting up children 
for healthier futures. She loved 
the outdoors and grew up skiing 
with her family. She saw right 
through all of the bullshit thrown 
at her growing up and instead 
focused on finding true friends. 
She cried to my grandparents 
about problems with her friends 
and feeling overwhelmed by the 
world in the same way that I do. 
She understood the importance of 
being authentic and in tune with 
her heart. She was a beautiful, 
inquisitive soul who had a simple 
love for exploring the world and all 
its wonders. And the world loved 
her back for as long as it could. 

The temple lobby is as antiqued 

and musty as ever. The dusty brown 
carpeting, the abstract art donated 
by half-hearted temple dues – all 

of it is the same as whenever I had 
been here last. As we take our seats 
in the giant, stained glass-adorned 
synagogue, we grab prayer books 
filled with Hebrew that not even 
the Bar Mitzvah boy himself 
understands. 

Before they have the chance 

to take their socially distanced 
seats, my maternal grandparents 
come running towards me with 
love radiating from their teary 
eyes. They know I was planning 
on wearing her dress, but that 
doesn’t 
stop 
their 
emotions 

from overflowing all over their 
disposable masks. 

This 
dress 
had 
not 
even 

originally been owned by Liz; she 
found it at a thrift store (another 
hobby we share). A few years 
back, we were sorting through 
my grandparents’ closet when we 
stumbled upon this simple little 
flapper-esque dress. My grandma 
raved about how proud Liz was 
of this absolute steal of a Nicole 
Miller original dress. I had been 
waiting for the right occasion to 
wear it ever since. 

The service began with the 

booming voice of our rabbi as he 
welcomed my brother Ethan to the 
bema (stage) to begin the service. 
After 
months 
of 
memorizing 

Hebrew, he would finally be 
symbolically indoctrinated into 
manhood! He worked hard, he 
sang everything flawlessly and, 
best of all, he got sent a lot of 
checks from old family friends he 
wouldn’t recognize. The beauty of 
the reform Jewish Bar Mitzvah. 

After he finished his Torah 

portion, Ethan returned to his seat 
and the rabbi took the lead once 
again. 

“As per the family’s request, we 

will now recite the Mourner’s 
Kaddish, in honor of Ethan’s Aunt 
Liz.”

It was the uncontrollable kind 

of 
crying. 
The 
tears-silently-

streaming-down-your-face-
without-having-to-push-them-out 
kind of crying. The remembering-
the-baby-pictures-of-her, 
sitting-

next-to-my-mom-and-wondering-
what-could-have-been 
kind 

of crying. And it was hitting 
everyone. This was a wonderful 
day celebrating familial love and 
the ascendance into adulthood, yet 
it was clear that someone was still 
missing from the equation. And I 
was wearing that someone’s old 
dress.

Dickinson declares for NBA 

Draft while retaining eligibility

Paul Nasr: The NCAA failed Michigan, 

and softball as a whole

After 
an 
accolade-filled 

freshman 
season, 
Hunter 

Dickinson is testing the NBA 
waters. 

Wednesday 
afternoon, 

Dickinson 
announced 
that 

he will enter the NBA Draft 
while signing with an NCAA-
certified agent in order to 
retain his college eligibility. 

“It has always been my 

dream to play in the NBA, so it 
is important for me to gather 

information 
before 
making 

this 
decision,” 
Dickinson 

posted on Twitter. “I look 
forward to getting feedback 
and I am excited for the next 
steps of this process.” 

The 
7-foot-1 
Dickinson 

burst onto the scene as one of 
the nation’s premier centers, 
dominating the Big Ten as a 
freshman. He averaged 14.1 
points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.4 
blocks per game across 28 
appearances, 
23 
of 
which 

were starts. He was named 
Second Team All-American, 
First Team All-Big Ten and 
captured Big Ten Freshman of 
the Week honors a whopping 
seven times. 

Dickinson 
becomes 

the 
second 
Michigan 

underclassmen 
to 
declare 

for the draft, joining Franz 
Wagner, 
who 
declared 

last 
month 
following 
his 

sophomore 
season. 
While 

Wagner is a projected lottery 
pick, 
Dickinson 
has 
not 

appeared in many mock drafts. 

Should Dickinson stay in 

the NBA Draft, it would be 
a major loss for Michigan. 
With fifth-year senior center 
Austin Davis not taking an 
NCAA waiver to return for a 
sixth season, the Wolverines’ 
depth at center is limited 
to Dickinson and incoming 
freshman 
Moussa 
Diabate, 

who 
projects 
as 
more 
of 

a power forward. In that 
scenario, 
it’s 
likely 
that 

Michigan 
would 
need 
to 

search outside the program 
for options. 

Dickinson will have until 

July 7th, ten days following 

the NBA Draft Combine, to 
withdraw from the draft.

Dickinson 
proved 
to 
be 

a major factor in many of 
Michigan’s 
signature 
wins 

this 
season. 
He 
notched 

11 
points, 
15 
rebounds 

and 5 blocks in a road win 
over Wisconsin on Feb. 14 
following 
a 
23-day 
pause, 

scored 22 points against Ohio 
State in a top-five matchup on 
Feb. 21, and limited National 
Player of the Year frontrunner 
Luka Garza to a season low 16 
points in a Feb. 25 win over 
Iowa. In the nation’s toughest 
conference, Dickinson never 
looked the part of a freshman 
for the Wolverines. 

Much of Dickinson’s success 

can be attributed to Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard. The 
two frequently work together 
on one-on-one film sessions, 
and Howard’s past as a former 
big man at both the collegiate 
and professional level have 
helped Dickinson.

Sleepless in Seattle. 
For the Michigan softball team, 

a long weekend in the Pacific 
Northwest turned even longer in 
the early hours of Monday morning. 

After dealing with 14 innings of 

NCAA Player of the Year finalist 
Gabbie Plain, Michigan was sent 
packing back to Ann Arbor. The 
double–header 
sweep 
abruptly 

ended the Wolverines’ promising 
season, yet they were denied the 
opportunity of a night’s stay in 
Seattle before heading back home. 

Instead, they had to endure 

a near-instant turnaround. At 4 
A.M. PST, Michigan was at Seattle-
Tacoma 
International 
Airport, 

checking in its large travel party for 
a 6 A.M. flight to Detroit. 

After already feeling wronged 

by being sent to the West Coast 
instead of hosting a regional, 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins did 
not appreciate the travel schedule 
thrust upon her team. She took aim 
at the NCAA in a series of tweets 
from the airport. 

Having 
just 
completed 
her 

37th season as the head softball 
coach at Michigan, the winningest 
coach in NCAA softball history is 
no stranger to the NCAA and the 
way it conducts its business. She 
does not shy away from calling the 

organization out either. 

This past March, for instance, 

disparities between the men’s 
and women’s NCAA basketball 
tournaments were laid bare on 
social media. Hutchins and her 
team made their voices heard in 
the matter, directly criticizing the 
NCAA for its failures.

Hutchins has become a titan 

in activism for equality in sports 
throughout her storied career. 
Her Title IX fight has been well-
documented, 
and 
tremendous 

strides have been made since 
Hutchins 
began 
coaching 
at 

Michigan in 1985. 

There is, however, a long way to 

go. 

Despite all the progress, there 

continue to be roadblocks. When a 
group of athletes lay it all on-the-
line in elimination softball, battling 
late into the night, a 6 A.M. cross-
country commercial flight early the 
next morning becomes one of those 
roadblocks. 

The Wolverines’ grievances with 

the NCAA earlier in the week were 
directed towards the organization’s 
disregard for their body of work on 
the softball diamond this season. 
They were sent west, forced to 
face an underseeded Washington 
team that they would eventually 
succumb to, and then sent home 
immediately afterward. 

“(The NCAA softball committee) 

disrespected our entire conference.” 

Hutchins said after the selection 
show on May 16. “(They) absolutely 
did not do a very good job.” 

Hutchins believed the NCAA 

did not truly know the teams it 
was evaluating, an outcome she 
foreshadowed earlier that week. 

And her prophecy came true. 
The COVID pandemic caused 

major schedule changes in sports 
throughout the NCAA landscape. 
Cutting down on travel decreases 
the amount of out-of-conference 
games teams can play, and limits 
their abilities to show postseason 
NCAA committees how they stack 
up to the rest of the nation when 
seeding rolls around. 

This became less of an issue in 

sports like basketball. In basketball, 
the NCAA has been refining its 
NET rankings to aid committees 
in team evaluations over the last 
couple of seasons. With NET, teams 
are evaluated using a far more 
holistic approach, one that goes 
beyond simple strength of schedule 
via 
opponents’ 
records 
alone. 

NET uses multifaceted analytics 
to 
provide 
greater-accuracy 

evaluations of teams, giving teams 
that opted for more-local schedules 
due to the pandemic a fair-shake in 
tournament seeding. 

That type of high-level, complex 

data was unavailable for those

When Michigan’s biggest strength became its Achilles’ heel

Bats go quiet, come up short against Nebraska

SEATTLE — All year, there were 

two people Michigan could count 
on.

Pitchers 
Alex 
Storako 
and 

Meghan Beaubien.

One was the Big Ten pitcher of 

the year, and the other, a senior who 
came into the weekend ranked 12th 
in the country with her ERA of 1.08. 
No other team in the field of 64 in 
the NCAA softball tournament had 
a pair of pitchers better. And with 
a superb outfield behind them, it 
was easy to see why the Wolverines 
posed a threat to any team that 
came across them.

At least on paper that is.
In the biggest game of Michigan’s 

season, where it was just one win 
away from its first super regional 
since 2016, its two aces combined to 
give up 13 hits and ten runs — season 
highs in both categories.

To name a few more of the 

absurd hitting stats Washington 

compiled against two of the best 
pitchers in the nation. The Huskies 
batted 0.419, they hit three for five 
with the bases loaded and batted 
over 0.400 with runners in scoring 
position. Numbers the Wolverines 
simply haven’t given up all year, 
not even close. With the majority 
of that damage being done in just 
the bottom of the fourth, where 
Washington scored seven runs.

An inning that truly showed 

Michigan what type of night it was, 
and the aces up its sleeve were gone. 
An inning that started off with a solo 
home run from Husky outfielder 
Jadelyn Allchin that cut into the 
Wolverines’ lead and sent Storako to 
the dugout. Just under three weeks 
after she threw 23 strikeouts in an 
eight inning game against Michigan 
State, a program record, Storako 
was benched. The pitcher, fresh off 
a no-hitter on Friday and a perfect 
game last Sunday, Beaubien, was 
brought on to try and patch up the 
wound and stop the bleeding. 

That did not happen.
Instead, the Huskies smelled 

blood and like a pack of wolves, they 
jumped on their prey, piling on six 
more runs and eating up every pitch 
Beaubien flung their way.

By the time the inning was over, 

Washington’s entire lineup made it 
up to bat. And, the scoreboard read 
10-5, Huskies.

“I don’t know what to say,” 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchines 
said in a somber post game press 
conference. 
“They’re 
a 
strong, 

powerful 
team 
and 
they…,” 

Hutchins 
paused. 
“They 
were 

pretty formidable.”

But there are, in fact, things to be 

said. One of which being that in the 
biggest game of the year, they were 
outdone by what gave them the edge 
all year. All year long Michigan lived 
by its pitching, but on Sunday night, 
it also died by it.

Juxtapose 
that 
with 
their 

opponent, another team who lived 
and died by their star pitcher — 
Gabbie Plain — all year, and the 
difference is striking. Plain threw 
over 200 hundred pitches on the 
night — including her count from 

the first game of the doubleheader 
— and yet, she still came up big. 
After Plain gave up five runs in the 
first two innings, she only saw 15 
batters over the final five innings, 
the minimum, and didn’t allow a 
single run.

And that was the difference 

between the two sides. Strength 

against 
strength, 
Washington 

overpowered the Wolverines, and 
ended their season.

On a night where the Huskies 

were the better team. On a night 
where Plain was the better pitcher.

On a night where Michigan’s 

biggest strength was its Achilles’ 
heel.

Trailing 5-1 in the top of the 

ninth inning, sophomore first 
baseman Jimmy Obertop launched 
a home run over the left-field wall. 
Obertop brought the Wolverines 
within two runs, leaving the 
door open for another comeback 
opportunity. 
Michigan 
went 

down swinging, a microcosm of 
their offensive struggles this past 
weekend at Nebraska. During 
their three games against the 
Cornhuskers, 
the 
Wolverines 

mustered a measly five runs.

In the opening game on Friday, 

Michigan was stumped at the plate. 
Through the first four innings, 
they produced hardly any offense. 
Their lone baserunner came via 
a hit by pitch in the top of the 
fourth. In the fifth, however, the 
Wolverines appeared poised to 
break the scoreless tie. Sophomore 
infielder Ted Burton worked a 
walk and sophomore outfielder 
Tito Flores lined a single down the 
left-field line. 

With two men on and no outs, 

Michigan finally had a chance 
to score. Unfortunately for the 
Wolverines, the next three batters 

were silenced. Michigan would 
have a few more chances with 
runners in scoring position, but 
they were unable to put anything 
on the scoreboard, falling 1-0. The 
lineup may have disappointed 

against Nebraska, but that did not 
deter the team’s confidence.

“What doesn’t show is the 

amount of barrels that we did put in 
play,” Flores said. “We understand 
that this is baseball, failure is going 

to come. But when that hits, how 
can we overcome that adversity 
and keep competing.”

During the first half of Saturday’s 

doubleheader, 
the 
Wolverines’s 

early struggles continued. Through 

three innings, they had done 
nothing. Then, they finally scored 
against the Cornhuskers thanks to 
a pair of walks, a passed ball, and a 
fielder’s choice RBI. 

Michigan would tack on another, 

but the story of game two was 
sophomore right-hander Cameron 
Weston. He more than made up for 
the quiet offensive performance, 
pitching seven scoreless innings. 
His excellence pushed his team 
over the hump and propelled them 
to an even series.

Weston’s offense may not have 

given him much support, but 
like Flores, his mindset remains 
unchanged.

“We were hitting balls hard, 

I don’t have any concern for it 
moving forward,” Weston said. 
“We feel prepared. We feel like 
we’ll 
play 
our 
best 
baseball, 

whenever the lights turn on. 
We’re pretty confident. Whatever 
happens, happens.”

In the second half of the 

doubleheader, 
the 
Wolverines 

had an opportunity to erase their 
offensive shortcomings and steal 
the series. They did not come 
through. For the first eight innings 
of the game, they were shut out.

Pitching and defense.
Those were the themes for 

both teams throughout the series 
as the Michigan baseball team 
(27-17 Big Ten) went 1-2 to close 
the regular season at Nebraska 
(31-12).

In 
game 
one, 
redshirt 

sophomore left-hander Steven 
Hajjar took the hill for the 
Wolverines. 
Hajjar 
tossed 
a 

complete game, giving up just one 
run on four hits. Hajjar picked 
up five strikeouts in the contest, 
dominating for much of the game.

“Steve was really good. He was 

throwing hard, he had all of his 
pitches working, he was using 
his change-up a lot,” Sophomore 
right-hander Cameron Weston 
said. He was using his changeup 
to get a lot of early outs and used 
our defense. He usually is a high 
strikeout guy but he was able to 
get early outs on Friday, which 
made him go deep into the game.”

But 
the 
Michigan 
offense 

did not fare much better than 

Nebraska’s. 
The 
Wolverines 

picked up four hits as well but 
were unable to push across a 
run and fell, 1-0. Sophomore 
outfielder Tito Flores led the 
way with two hits, but was 
thrown out trying to stretch a 
double into a triple, rendering 
graduate transfer catcher Griffin 
Mazur’s ensuing single useless. 
Sophomore 
outfielder 
Clark 

Elliott also reached twice in the 
game.

In game two, the Wolverines 

picked up a win in another 
close-fought, low scoring affair. 
Weston was electric, allowing 
just four hits over seven scoreless 
innings.

“(Hajjar and Weston) came to 

play,” Flores said. “You can see 
it in their eyes, they kept their 
composure. They just full-out 
played Michigan baseball, all the 
way, just competed all the way 
through and played for the eight 
letters across their chest.”

The 
defense 
was 
on 
full 

display as well. Graduate transfer 
infielder Benjamin Sems made 
a spectacular spinning play in 
the first to record an out, while 

graduate 
transfer 
infielder 

Christian Molfetta also made 
several nice plays. Meanwhile, 
the 
Huskers 
made 
several 

diving catches in the outfield 

and the third baseman made 
several diving stops to rob the 
Wolverines of multiple hits in 
each of the three games.

“I was just getting a lot of 

strikes,” Weston said. “Getting 
a lot of ground balls and just 
letting my defense work for me.”

Matt Frey: No regrets

Inside the Michigan baseball 

program, it’s customary for a 
senior to make a short speech to 
his teammates before each series. 
Before the Wolverines’ season-
opening series against Iowa, fifth-
year infielder Matt Frey took his 
turn.

In the speech, he told his 

teammates that they won’t know 
when they’ve played their last game, 
so they should always play and act in 
a way that will leave them with no 
regrets when that time comes. Frey 
considered the topic to be a little 
ironic, because he was about to enter 
his fifth season of college baseball 
and will likely play a sixth. But he’s 
also an expert on the subject.

In the fall of 2020, Frey was 

preparing for his best season yet. 
He had improved steadily and 
significantly during his four years 
at 
Davidson, 
progressing 
from 

a light-hitting bench piece as an 
underclassman 
to 
an 
everyday 

player as a junior to a five-tool 
standout as a senior, when he slashed 
.327/.507/.551 with five stolen bases 
in a shortened season. Then he used 
the spring and summer to get even 
better.

“Over quarantine, I decided to try 

to swing the bat harder,” Frey said. 
“And then balls that I was hitting 
that were outs when I was not 
swinging as hard started to fall or go 
over the fence.”

When the NCAA announced an 

extra year of eligibility for Division 
1 baseball players in response to 
COVID-19, 
Frey 
committed 
to 

Michigan. Davidson coach Rucker 
Taylor played under Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich at Vanderbilt, and sung 
Bakich’s praises to Frey.

“The culture that (Bakich) has 

built around here, the winning 
mentality that he’s built around 
here, the team performance, coupled 
with the academic side …. It was a 
no-brainer,” Frey said of his decision 
to commit to Michigan.

When he arrived in Ann Arbor, 

Frey continued to improve with the 
help of Michigan’s coaching staff 

and other program resources. He 
established himself as Michigan’s 
best hitter “by a landslide” during 
fall practices, according to Bakich, 
and was the frontrunner to be the 
team’s starting third baseman.

Then disaster struck. 
Frey was fielding a bunt during 

the last official fall practice when 
his cleat got stuck in the turf, 
making him fall and twist his knee 
awkwardly. He was able to get up 
and walk, and didn’t think the injury 
was very severe. But an MRI taken 
shortly after revealed that he had 
torn his ACL, ruling Frey out for the 
entire 2021 season. 

Frey had played his last baseball 

of the near future. So when he told 
his teammates that they’ll never 
know when time’s up, he knew what 
he was talking about.

Even though he can’t play, he’s 

found ways to contribute that are 
just as important. Frey has managed 
to become an indispensable part of 
Team 155 and has made the most of 
his time at Michigan.

Michigan 
takes 
its 
pitching 

machine with it on road trips. The 
machine is big and awkwardly 
shaped, and it always makes a 

loud crashing noise when it exits 
the luggage chute for the baggage 
carousel at the airport. 

Other passengers, waiting for 

their bags, furrow their brows 
as they try to make sense of the 
situation. Frey and his teammates 
find this hilarious. 

Little moments like that, he said, 

are what he has enjoyed most about 
this season.

An injury knocked Matt Frey out for the season. But he’s still found a way to be an
