On 
Monday 
afternoon, 
students and professors from 
the University of Michigan Data 
Science for Music Challenge 
Initiative 
conducted 
live 
research 
in 
Hill 
Auditorium 
during a musical performance 
and informational presentation 
before nearly 200 community 
members. James Kibbie, chair 
of the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance Organ Department, 
and Daniel Forger, professor of 
mathematics, received a grant 
from the Michigan Institute for 
Data Science to collaborate on 
the analysis of organ playing by 
those with varying levels of music 
education.
“(Forger) and I have a big 
grant from MIDAS to study the 
big data science applications 
to specifically the Bach Trio 
Sonatas,” Kibbie said. “And we 

are looking at a number of things, 
but especially how data can 
reveal issues of performance and, 
as Danny (Forger) says, ‘What 
makes one sublime and another 
ordinary.’”
Kibbie said they chose to 
analyze the organ because it may 
be easily analyzed given only one 
note is played in each of the three 
keyboards at a time.
“The right hand is controlling 
one melody line, the left hand 
another and the pedal a third,” 
Kibbie said. “They are totally 
independent, but every detail 
matters so there’s no room for 
faking.”
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
graduate student Sarah Simko, 
research assistant on the project, 
told the crowd about the rich 
history of the Frieze Memorial 
Organ housed in Hill Auditorium, 
which was used for the event’s 
performances. Dating back to 
1894, parts of the organ are older 

than Hill Auditorium and were 
moved there upon the building’s 
construction.
“I always say that the organ is 
part history, part engineering and 
part actually being able to pick up 
your fingers and put them back 
down,” Simko said.
As it exists now, there are 
7,599 pipes hidden behind the 
walls of Hill, which produce the 
music when someone plays the 
keyboards electronically attached 
to them. Simko said it is this 
capacity of the Frieze Memorial 
Organ that makes it an optimal 
instrument for their research.
“Professor Forger is the first 
person who figured out you can 
take 
this 
mechanism 
which 
already exists and actually use it 
for analytical purposes,” Simko 
said.
In addition to finding an 
optimal instrument, Kibbie and 
Forger also had to determine a 
good piece of music to analyze. 

Kibbie explained to the audience 
how they decided on Bach’s 
sonatas 
because 
they 
were 
originally used as a teaching tool 
for Bach’s eldest son and have 
continued to be used in music 
education programs for centuries 
since. Until Bach, trio sonatas 
were often written for three 
distinct instruments played by 
three individual musicians.
“Johann Sebastian Bach was 
the first composer to realize how 
beautifully this texture adapts to 
being played by one person on the 
organ,” Kibbie said.
Forger 
cited 
Bach 
as 
a 
fundamental 
baseline 
for 
an emerging study into the 
“grammar” of music. There are 
thousands of chord progressions 
possible on the organ of which 
Bach only uses about 11 percent, 
Forger’s research suggests.

On Monday evening, about 
75 students attended Muslim 
Creatives Collect hosted by the 
University of Michigan’s Muslim 
Students’ Association at the 
Kerrytown Concert House. The 
program marked the beginning 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Engagement 
Week, which is a week-long 

initiative aimed at highlighting 
the 
narratives, 
history 
and 
culture of Muslims. About 75 
students and other members of 
the Ann Arbor community were 
at the event.
The 
event 
consisted 
of 
performances involving music, 
poetry and dance as well as a 
panel discussing the current and 
future status of Muslim creatives 
in the country.

Along 
with 
the 
Muslims 
Creatives Collect event, the 
Islamic 
Engagement 
Week 
will also include a Muslims 
in Astronomy event Tuesday 
night, a Meet a Muslim event on 
Wednesday and a Muslims in the 
Arts event Friday afternoon.
Rackham student Bedar Noor 
participated as part of a step 
performance during the event. 
He spoke about his appreciation 

for step and the way in which 
it has allowed him to express 
himself.
“Step is a great way to show 
that you can join an organization 
that 
is 
rooted 
in 
different 
cultures and histories and I 
wanted to show to everyone that 
there is a different medium to 
express yourself,” Noor said.

On 
Monday 
evening, 
South 
African 
activists 
and 
educators Klaas Mokgomole and 
Mmamalema Molepo spoke to a 
group of more than 30 students in 
the Ross School of Business about 
the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict and its relation to the 
apartheid government in South 
Africa. The event was co-hosted 
by 
Africans 
for 
Peace, 
an 
organization that writes about 
global affairs from an African 
perspective, in addition to Hillel, 
Chabad and Stand With Us, a pro-
Israel student organization.
The 
discussion, 
which 
attracted a predominantly white 
and Jewish audience, focused 
on Mokgomole and Molepo’s 
experiences 
visiting 
Israel 
after becoming involved with 
the Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions movement as university 
students in South Africa.

recent college admissions scandal 
and more.
The Michigan Daily: After the 
false alarm of the active shooter 
incident, many students have 
cited their confusion and worries 
about the University’s ability to 
communicate during emergency 
situations in a timely manner. What 
is your advice for students and how 
do you respond to these concerns?
Harper: First, get off of the

police scanner and thinking that 
everything that goes across the 
scanner is correct will only make 
it worse.

CAMPUS LIFE

At Monday’s session of the 
Ann Arbor City Council, several 
student organizations, including 
the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats, the 
Climate Action Movement and 
Roosevelt Institute, as well Ann 
Arbor residents, spoke to urge 
city councilmembers to support 
a resolution to direct funds to 
address 
affordable 
housing, 
climate action and pedestrian 
safety. 
The county levied a new tax that 
started in December to provide for 
county mental health and county 
sheriff’s services. However, a 
quarter of the proceeds have been 
returned to several cities that fund 
their own police departments to be 
used at their discretion. Ann Arbor 
is set to receive $2.2 million from 
the partial rebate. This resolution 
would direct the returns from the 
countywide millage to address 
affordable housing, climate action 
and pedestrian safety. 
The resolution was sponsored 
by Mayor Chris Taylor and 
Councilmember Kathy Griswold, 
D-Ward 2, and passed 6-4, with 
Councilmembers Jane Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, Jack Eaton, D-Ward 
4, Ali Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, and 
Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 1, voting no. 
The resolution mirrors Taylor’s 
40-40-20 policy, a plan that 
pledged 40 percent of funds for 

affordable housing, 40 percent for 
climate action and 20 percent for 
pedestrian safety. 
At the beginning of the meeting, 
the Student Advisory Council 
presented their annual report, 
which made recommendations 
regarding several issues impacting 
the student community. 
SAC advises local government 
and 
institutions 
on 
issues 
impacting all students of Ann 
Arbor. The SAC was formed in 2017 
and consists of two undergraduate 
students appointed by the Central 
Student 
Government, 
two 
graduate students, two students 
from local high schools and a city 
councilmember liaison.
Though their report did not 
specifically address the millage 
allocation 
resolution, 
they 
touched on many similar themes. 
SAC 
Chair 
and 
Engineering 
junior Kenji Yeoh said the group 
focused on two key issues: campus 
safety and housing affordability. 
SAC urged councilmembers to 
continue to allocate funds for 
affordable housing and to create 
more affordable housing units.
“The 
student 
population 
continues to grow, putting a 
strain on the housing system in 
Ann Arbor,” Yeoh said. “There 
has not been enough progress 
on creating more affordable 
housing units.”

Looking at the Numbers

The 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs met on Monday with 
Provost Martin Philbert and 
discussed the importance 
of 
institutional 
diversity, 
tuition and the new policy 
regarding 
faculty-student 
relationships.
Incoming SACUA members 
Elena 
Gallo, 
associate 
professor of astronomy, and 
Sara Ahbel-Rappe, professor 
of Greek and Latin, attended 
the meeting but are unable 
to vote until they officially 
become members on May 1.
SACUA chair Neil Marsh, 
professor of chemistry, said 
elections for chair and vice 
chair of SACUA will take 
place at next week’s meeting.

Philbert 
began 
his 
meeting with SACUA by 
thanking them for their work 
throughout the semester.
SACUA 
member 
Sami 
Malek, professor of internal 
medicine, said SACUA and 
the administration should 
try to improve institutional 
culture among faculty and 
not just focus on policy 
changes.
“You know, a lot of what 
we’ve done here at SACUA 
really centers on not the 
common daily routine, but 
rather 
the 
accesses 
and 
the 
discretions 
and 
the 
punishment and whatnot,” 
Malek said. “But the issue 
of sort of culture, this place 
and how we can all make it 
more collegial and better.”
SACUA 
member 
Sarah 
Lippert, associate professor 

of art history at U-M Flint, 
agreed 
with 
Malek 
and 
said she would like to see 
a culture shift in terms of 
prioritizing and promoting 
ethics as a primary goal. 
“I think one thing that 
to me strikes me regarding 
culture is I would like to 
see the University — and 
this requires participation 
from 
administrators, 
the 
regents, faculty, students, 
staff — really become more 
focused on the integrity and 
ethics of how we treat each 
other. And I don’t really, I’ve 
worked with the University 
of Michigan for a while, I 
do see us trying to work 
towards those goals, but I 
don’t really see it as a stated 
focus.”
In response to a question 
about the budget for the fall 
2019 
semester, 
Philbert 
said 
the 
administration 
is not sure about state 
appropriations or tuition 
increases 
yet. 
He 
said 
tuition is the largest and 
most stable component of 
the budget, but the market 
is not very elastic, and 
they have to balance the 
needs of the school with 
the needs of students and 
families. 
He 
said 
if 
programs 
such 
as 
the 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee began covering 
fees outside of tuition, the 
payment for that would 
come from other families’ 
tuition.
“So, one of the one of the 
underlying principles to 
our budget making is long-
term sustainability, and 
long-term 
sustainability 
not just for us internally, 
but in terms of adding a 
degree of predictability for 
families who will pay their 
tuition,” 
Philbert 
said. 
“We also operate under 

the general understanding, 
though I haven’t been able 
to find it written anywhere, 
that if we add 1 percent in 
fees, that comes off tuition, 
so it is a zero-sum game.”
After Philbert left, SACUA 
discussed the new Standard 
Practice 
Guide 
policy 
regarding 
faculty-student 
relationships. Lippert said 
SACUA 
agrees 
with 
the 
intention of the policy, to 
increase the ease of the 
reporting process, but the 
language of the policy itself 
is vague and has potentially 
harmful loopholes.
“The issue is that this 
policy has ambiguities that 
can actually lead to harm 
to students and faculty in 
the ways in which it could 
be applied,” Lippert said. 
“... In order for the policy to 
work perfectly and not harm 
people through misuse, we 
have to have perfect HR 
systems, we have to have 
perfect 
general 
counsel, 
we have to have perfect 
administrators. And what 
we’ve seen is we don’t have 
perfect systems.”
Ahbel-Rappe said SACUA 
is dedicated to the safety and 
security of all community 
members, and that should 
be made clear throughout 
any statements they release 
regarding the policy.
“We should be very clear 
that SACUA is concerned 
to 
do 
whatever 
we 
can 
to 
protect 
our 
students 
and 
people 
in 
positions 
of less power from sexual 
predation,” 
Ahbel-Rappe 
said. “I don’t think that we 
should just say you have 
problems with this policy 
and not emphasize that we 
are committed to the well-
being of the people on all 
accounts.”


He said this indicates there 
are presumably rules as to which 
progressions 
are 
aesthetically 
pleasing to listeners and which our 
intuition tells us should be avoided 
in composition.
“There is some sort of an 
interesting structure to this,” 
Forger said. “Right now, we’re 
trying to figure out what is that 
structure.”
Forger explained the primary 
goal of their project is to determine 
the psychological or neurological 
basis for patterns in the practice and 
performance of the sonatas that are 
not prescribed by the composer. 
Kibbie said it is these nuances that 
make music interesting.
“The Trio Sonatas are notorious 
for 
this 
unpredictability 
of 
performance,” Kibbie said. “What 
Bach wrote on the music score 
is not everything that’s needed 
for a complete, successful artistic 
performance.”
Kibbie, Forger and their student 
assistants represent one of the four 
teams participating in MIDAS-
funded Data Science of Music 

Challenge 
Initiative 
research 
this school year. Kibbie said it is 
wonderful to have received an 
opportunity from the University to 
engage in unique, interdisciplinary 
research between the fields of math 
and music.
“Musicians 
are 
sometimes 
skeptical of math analysis and 
data analysis because so much of 
what we do is intuitive, and I hope 
particularly the musicians will 
come away with an understanding 
that data science can support our 
creativity and our intuition and 
challenge it,” Kibbie said.
University 
alum 
Kevin 
Flannagan studied data analysis 
and music in conjunction as an 
undergraduate. He returned to 
campus to see the presentation. 
Flannagan told The Daily after the 
event that he sees many similarities 
between the studies of math and 
music.
“They’re both things that kind 
of reward focused effort and people 
who are sort of willing to spend a 
lot of time sitting alone working on 
something, so I think the skills that 
you need are the same for both,” 
Flannagan said.
Kibbie 
said 
the 
University 
provides 
the 
unique 
context 

most conducive to this type of 
interdisciplinary research.
“We have the best of both 
worlds,” Kibbie said. “We operate 
as a small, elite conservatory 
but embedded in this first-class 
research 
institution, 
so 
our 
students have the resources of the 
full University while we also have 
the focus study of music or theater 
and dance.”
Kibbie said the team intends 
to continue with and expand 
their research. The University is 
in the process of developing new 
technology to get more pure and 
detailed data.
“This is just the first phase,” 
Kibbie said. “The really exciting 
thing is that the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance is raising funds 
now to commission a major new 
studio organ that is going to have 
groundbreaking data interface … It 
will be the first organ in the world 
that will allow data collection in 
a much more nuanced way that is 
possible here.”
Kibbie said he is extremely 
proud of the work this research is 
accomplishing at the forefront of 
its field.

From Page 1

I would offer students one 
source when we’re in a situation 
like that and that’s the Division of 
Public Safety and Security. I think 
what President Schlissel outlined 
beautifully in his email letter is 
get the (Michigan) app … My other 
advice would be to pay attention. 
This idea of earphones on, walking 
around, being oblivious is probably 
not wise. I think the good news 
is we got a real practice run. We 
learned a lot of things about our 
system. Some people learned about 
what dead zones are like for their 
phones, that they didn’t sign up (for 
emergency alerts), that they didn’t 
have the app. Some people were 
listening to the (police) scanner 
and thought everything it reported 
was real. You can see how all of that 
adds to the confusion. I think what 
I’ve heard Director Washington 
(Executive Director of DPSS) 
say the source is the Department 
of Public Safety and Security ... 
We learned a lot of things we are 
going to get better at. For that, I’m 
appreciative. I think now we just 
have to benefit from the things 
we’ve learned.
TMD: A new Central Student 
Government president and vice 
president, LSA sophomore Ben 
Gerstein and LSA junior Isabelle 
Blanchard, were recently elected. 

What do you hope to come from 
their administration and how do 
you plan to work with them to 
achieve their goals?
Harper: Typically, what I do is I 
meet with the new administration 
and usually the old administration, 
so Daniel (Greene) and Izzy (Baer), 
will come. They will talk a bit about 
what it is they want to accomplish 
and during the course of that 
conversation I will be thinking 
about, given what they want to 
accomplish, who is it that they need 
to be connected to. We go through 
a kind of orientation so they know 
which areas of the University are 
responsible for the items they’re 
concerned for or an agenda item 
they might want to have … I try 
not to come into a new student 
body presidency with something 
in mind I need them to do. My goal 
is to help them understand what 
it is or how it is I can help them 
achieve their goals because they 
have a sense of what they want to 
accomplish. They have to represent 
all students, not some, but all. I 
try to remind them this is not an 
elevation of you. All of us sit in the 
seats we sit in to help advance the 
mission of the University. If you’ve 
been elected, you’ve been elected 
by the student body, and so your 
work becomes to represent them, 
not to advance a personal agenda. 
… I want to honor what they believe 
needs to happen, and then my job is 
to help them accomplish it.

the transparency of admissions 
processes and from students and 
parents. What would you say to 
students of lower socioeconomic 
backgrounds who feel they might 
be disadvantaged in terms of 
opportunities when compared to 
wealthier students?
Harper: I don’t think the issue 
on the table is wealth, to be quite 
frank. I think the issue on the table 
is character and integrity. And if a 
person lacks character or integrity, 
that can be the case whether 
you’re poor or rich. So, I want to 
be careful that we don’t paint this 
as a wealth—the money created an 
opportunity for people who didn’t 
have any integrity or character to 
do something that was wrong. We 
have plenty of wealthy people, and 
poor people, with lots of integrity, 
and would not use their resources 
that way no matter what. … This 
isn’t about wealth. Wealth and 
money were the tools, this was 
really about character and the 
degree to which you have integrity 
and you are honest. … This is a 
place that honors hard work, this 
is a place that looks holistically, so 
getting into Michigan just on your 
GPA and just on your test scores is 
not enough. And so, I think focusing 

on who you are and doing your very 
best and making the case, is what 
I would say. Getting distracted by 
people who are dishonest, you and 
I can’t fix that in someone. What 
we can do is not be dishonest with 
ourselves, to not cheat.
TMD: Emilio Gutiérrez Soto, 
a Knight-Wallace Fellow at the 
University, is scheduled to be 
deported after he was denied 
asylum. Also, an event occurred 
Monday, March 25 detailing efforts 
the University has taken on to help 
undocumented. How do you try 
to help undocumented or asylum-
seeking students get the resources 
they need while also following 
state and federal law?
Harper: So, we do have Robert 
Sellers, our chief diversity officer, 
designated a staff member, Hector 
Galvan, to work with documented 
and undocumented students. We 
have a website that has resources 
there for the students. Our student 
legal services have lawyers — they 
are available to help students. 
And so, I think those kinds of 
resources that the law allows us to 
provide, we provide. … Sometimes 
students are afraid; they aren’t 
afraid necessarily because they 
may be able to be on campus but 
their parents are undocumented 
and so they worry about what 
the implications will be for their 
parents. Some students actually 
came to speak at the Board of 
Regents meeting to ask us to take a 

look at our policies and procedures 
around in-state and out-of-state 
and make sure that we aren’t 
disadvantaging 
students 
who 
actually have to work a little bit 
and go to school a little bit, work 
a little bit and go to school a little 
bit. … Some of our wealthy parents 
have given us money to be able to 
provide support for undocumented 
students. So I think having the 
resources 
available, 
having 
someone you can talk with, making 
sure that we honor students’ 
privacy rights, which we would 
always do, making sure there is a 
way for students to find out what 
the resources are and to take 
advantage of them, meeting with 
students if they have this concern. I 
think those are the kinds of things 
we try to do as an institution to 
make this place work.
TMD: After a Dec. 10 article in 
The Daily revealed 40 years’ worth 
of sexual misconduct allegations 
against SMTD professor Stephen 
Shipps, Shipps retired Feb. 28. 
How do you hope the University 
can better help students with the 
reporting process when there 
are allegations against faculty 
members?
Harper: I think you’ve seen 
the 
University 
take 
actions 
strengthening 
this 
romantic 
relationship policy. I hope or think 
you’ve seen that the University 
is very clear that it’s not going 
to be tolerated … So, I think we 

need three things. One, students 
(need) to have the courage to keep 
reporting … I think those of us that 
are responsible for hearing and 
believing need to hear and believe. 
And I think all of us have to get 
much more mindful of our behavior 
and our language and the power 
differential that exists between 
students and staff, and students 
and faculty members. So, I think 
every part of our community has 
a role to play in terms of shutting 
this down. Students have to believe 
they are going to be believed and 
tell it and say something … We 
have to look at our policies and 
procedures and make sure they 
are as strong as they can be. Then, 
we have to continue to strengthen 
our training 
 — but everybody has 
to use their voice. We have to be 
good bystanders for each other. We 
have to say something … because 
what hurts is the silence … It’s 
a culture change that’s going to 
have to occur. While policies and 
procedures and training is really 
important, us owning that we are 
not going to be in a community that 
accepts this that is the only thing 
that will change it. … People who 
want to harm count on not telling 
… it’s almost like we are in a battle 
with fear or doubt … because that’s 
what someone who’s trying to 
harm you will always use … so we 
have to be afraid and say something 
anyways.

Noor also spoke about his 
admiration for the panel, 
saying 
it 
touched 
on 
a 
number of important topics.
“I love the panel,” Noor 
said. 
“Really 
being 
able 
to show not just that (the 
panelists) are artists but 
why they became artists 
is really a great thing and 
really is eye-opening. A lot 
of the times, you think that 
it’s just STEM, but there’s 
other things that you can do 
too, especially if you have 
that creativity.”
During 
the 
panel 
discussion, LSA sophomore 
Basil Alsubee spoke about 
his 
views 
on 
the 
state 
of Muslim artists in the 
U.S. 
Alsubee 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
opportunity to speak on the 
panel in an interview with 
The Daily following the 
event.
“I’ve 
just 
been 
really 
looking 
for 
a 
platform 
to speak to the Muslim 

community, which is my 
own community, about the 
work that I do and art and 
culture and media of Islam 
as it pertains to the Muslim 
community,” Alsubee said.
Alsubee told The Daily 
the panel members’ ideas 
complemented each other.
“We think about a lot 
of similar things, but I 
think we fill each other’s 
gaps,” 
Alsubee 
said. 
“I 
was really struck by the 
insightful processing of art 
and media that they’ve had 
— their own experiences, 
both the similarities and 
differences.”
Alsubee also expressed 
his 
personal 
interest 
in 
Islamic history and desire 
to go to other events in the 
Islamic Engagement Week.
“I really want to go to 
the 
under-represented 
perspectives 
(event),” 
he 
said. 
“I’ve 
become 
interested 
in 
the 
topic 
as someone who studies 
history. 
I’m 
really 
interested 
in 
historical 
silences and things that are 
just generally difficult to 

come by, both the historical 
record and contemporary 
culture.”
After the event, Art & 
Design freshman Gabriel 
Consiglio told The Daily he 
appreciated the program.
“I heard it through word-
of-mouth,” Consiglio said. 
“In terms of organization 
for the event, I think this 
is a perfect venue for what 
it is. I’ve never been to 
something like this before, 
so the format of this is 
pretty interesting. I like 
the blend of discussion and 
art.”
Consiglio also appreciated 
the association’s decision to 
pause the event at 8 p.m. to 
allow everyone time to pray.
“I think it’s very cool that 
they’re taking out the time 
to pray,” Consiglio said. 
“Being someone who is not 
entirely in this religion, 
I 
think 
this 
is 
really 
important, especially since 
not all of the events are 
about Islam.”

Mokgomole was an active 
member of the BDS student 
group at the University of 
Witwatersrand. Molepo never 
officially joined the movement 
as a student at the University 
of Cape Town, but still believed 
Israel was an apartheid state. 
Both activists are no longer 
affiliated with the movement 
and said they now think BDS 
lied to them about the state of 
discrimination in Israel.
“Israel 
is 
still 
where 
Palestinians 
live,” 
Molepo 
said. “Israel is still where a lot 
of Palestinians go to school. 
Israel is still where a lot of 
Palestinians 
get 
their 
food 
from. Israel is still where a lot 
of Palestinians get their water 
from. Gaza gets their electricity 
from Israel and the one thing 
you never hear is that whenever 
the ‘right to return’ marches 
happen, people actually burn 
down the power stations in 
Gaza. So it becomes a thing 
where people lose power and 
the Israeli Defense Forces has 
to go and fix that.”
Mokgomole 
also 
said 
he 
was struck by the differences 
between Israel and apartheid 
South Africa, since he was 
often told that Israel was an 
apartheid state. After getting 
expelled from his university for 
antagonizing Jewish students, 
Mokgomole began to educate 
himself about Israeli society. 
He said when he visited Israel 
for the first time and asked an 

Israeli airport employee for 
the “Blacks-only bathroom,” 
he was surprised to receive a 
silent stare in response.
“I told him, ‘Look, I’m from 
South Africa and I was told that 
Israel is an apartheid state,’” 
Mokgomole said. “During the 
South African apartheid, Blacks 
and whites were not allowed to 
use the same bathrooms. Blacks 
and whites were not allowed to 
use the same buses, the same 
schools, a number of things. 
So I’m in Israel, and I was told 
Israel is an apartheid state, and 
in an apartheid state I don’t 
want to be arrested for using 
the wrong bathrooms. He said 
‘No, no, no, we don’t have that 
here. You can use any bathroom 
if you identify your gender and 
use the right bathroom for your 
gender.”
Echoing 
Mokgomole’s 
argument, 
Molepo 
noted 
how the four racially-based 
social 
classes 
that 
existed 
during 
the 
South 
African 
apartheid created a society 
built on discrimination that 
explicitly denied Black people 
their rights to education and 
employment. Molepo said even 
though he doesn’t agree with 
all of the Israeli government’s 
policies, he can’t classify it as 
an apartheid country because 
he doesn’t see the same kind of 
overt racism.
“Within the whites and the 
Blacks, you find that people 
weren’t allowed in the same 
bathrooms, the same buses, the 
same benches,” Molepo said. 
“Let’s say if my mother had 
to raise (a white boy), when 
they get to a park, she would 

have to sit on the floor and he 
would have to sit on the bench, 
because she’s not allowed to 
sit on the same bench as me no 
matter how close they are, no 
matter what. I find none of that 
in Israel.”
LSA 
senior 
Robert 
Weinbaum, a member of the 
University’s chapter of Stand 
With 
Us, 
invited 
the 
two 
activists to campus. He said 
he hoped the discussion would 
allow students to reach their 
own conclusions about whether 
Israel should be called an 
apartheid state or not.
“Being at an event on campus 
and especially in an academic 
setting, Israel being described 
as an apartheid state is an 
adjective, it is very matter-of-
fact,” Weinbaum said. “I never 
really found a place where that 
was discussion — what does 
that really mean? In what ways 
is it an apartheid state? I felt 
like it was important to create 
an environment where that 
kind of conversation could be 
held and really critically look 
at Israel and compare it to 
apartheid South Africa.”
LSA senior Emily Olin, who 
attended 
the 
conversation, 
studied at the University of 
Cape Town last semester and 
noted how prevalent anti-Israel 
sentiment was at the university. 
After seeing the BDS movement 
on the Cape Town campus, Olin 
said it was interesting to hear 
from South Africans with an 
alternate perspective.
“When 
we 
were 
at 
the 
University of Cape Town, we 
were there for Israeli boycott 
week, and I have pictures 

on my phone of the defaced 
Israeli flag,” Olin said. “My 
parents were visiting and I 
brought them up to campus 
and I was like, ‘Look, this is 
kind of crazy.’ I thought (this 
talk) was really interesting 
from the perspective of a non-
outsider who has experienced 
apartheid, 
real 
apartheid, 
not studied about it, not read 
about it — their families have 
experienced it. I think it was a 
very valuable perspective.”
Even though Molepo and 
Mokgomole 
stressed 
the 
differences 
between 
South 
African 
apartheid 
and 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, 
they said peace should be 
reached through negotiation 
just as apartheid was ended 
through 
election. 
Molepo 
said a two-state solution that 
preserves Israeli independence 
should be the goal of these 
discussions.
“We need to understand that 
Israel has a right to exist,” 
Molepo said. “BDS sometimes 
comes with a narrative that 
says, ‘From the river to the sea, 
Palestine will be free.’ So what 
does that say then for the Israeli 
child? What does that say for 
the people that were born in 
that period? Does that mean 
they’re nonexistent people? It’s 
something that we always need 
to be conscious of — the fact 
that these are people’s lives 
we’re speaking about at the end 
of the day.”

CONTROVERSY
From Page 1

College Democrats Chair 
Ruby Schneider, LSA junior, 
later voiced her support 
during public comments for 
the resolution. Schneider 
said currently Ann Arbor 
is not addressing climate 
change and needs to make 
changes to do so.
“To date, the city has 
never devoted more than 
0.2 percent of its budget 
to climate action — this 
must change,” Schneider 
said. “The 40-40-20 plan 
addresses issues that are 
critical to the future of Ann 
Arbor.”
LSA sophomore Devan 
O’Toole, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Roosevelt 
Institute 
and the Climate Action 
Movement, 
spoke 
in 
support of the resolution. 
He emphasized the urgency 
for 
intergenerational 
partnerships 
to 
respond 
to 
climate 
change 
and 
affordable housing.
“We from the student 
community 
urge 
City 
Council 
to 
uphold 
the 
40-40-20 tax revenue plan 
because we’re in this fight 
together to preserve an 
equitable and sustainable 
future 
for 
Ann 
Arbor,” 
O’Toole said.
Ramlawi 
then 
said 
though he supports actions 
to 
address 
affordable 
housing and climate action, 
he does not support the 

resolution. Ramlawi said 
the city recently received 
results 
from 
a 
resident 
survey that did not list 
affordable housing, climate 
action or pedestrian safety 
as top issues. Ramlawi said 
he was concerned the entire 
$2.2 million of the returns 
from 
the 
countywide 
millage would go toward 
issues that residents did 
not indicate as their top 
priorities.
“It 
doesn’t 
give 
us 
any money for any other 
issues,” Ramlawi said. “It 
spends all 2.2 million (from 
the county millage) without 
addressing any of our other 
priorities.”
Ramlawi 
also 
shared 
concerns 
the 
resolution 
would 
spend 
a 
huge 
portion of the funds. While 
Ramlawi 
commented 
on 
how he felt there’s no 
room in the budget for this 
resolution 
now, 
citizens 
in the audience objected, 
arguing climate change was 
happening now.
“I don’t see any money for 
this right now,” Ramlawi 
said. “We’re at a high 
watermark right now in 
our city’s budget. We’re in 
fortunate times, but I don’t 
think we’ll always be in this 
position, and we are setting 
some very high floors at a 
time when we’re at a high 
watermark in our budget.”

S

ocial media has evolved 
 
drastically 
during 
my 
lifetime. Since 
originating with the 
social 
networking 
platform Six Degrees 
in 1997, a primitive 
Myspace, it has grown 
in both influence and 
dynamism. 
After 
solidifying its roots 
with the recognizable 
Facebook in 2004, the 
following 
iterations 
of Twitter, Instagram 
and Snapchat pushed boundaries 
in social media’s format and style. 
In middle school, I experienced 
the popularization of influencers: 
teams of disciplined curators 
whose 
accounts 
wield 
the 
attention of millions and inform 
their concepts of language, dress, 
memes, social behaviors, politics 
and more. These influencers 
brought about an age of editing 
and analyzing on the photo-
sharing service Instagram, and 
further linked the platform to 
commercial 
agendas 
through 
advertising. In 2016, we witnessed 
social media play an influential 
role in presidential elections 
with Twitter, the microblogging 
service practically monopolizing 
the global political discourse 
between pundits, commenters, 
candidates 
and 
everyday 
Americans.
Social 
media 
is 
often 
criticized for its edited and 
filtered representations of people’s 
lives. These “highlight reels” 
are designed to technologically 
monetize users’ egos with a 
currency 
of 
validation. 
The 
Guardian’s article “Logged off: 
meet the teens who refuse to use 
social media” explores a Gen-Z 
backlash to the social pressures 
of 
Instagram 
and 
Facebook, 
while Psychology Today’s article 
“Does Using Social Media Make 
You Lonely?” and The New 
York Times’ piece “In Search of 
Lost Screen Time” examine the 
symptomatic issues.
What social media platforms 
are criticized for less frequently 
is the control they exercise over 
our interactions in worldwide 
discourse and their misuse of 
our personal information. These 
platforms have a responsibility 
to try to connect people from all 
around the world. The owners 
and moderators of these platforms 
must be held accountable for 
censorship and the control and 
backdoor trading of our personal 
data – if social media is to remain 
a force for good .
It is estimated that today 
nearly one-third of the planet 
uses social media platforms to 
connect beyond languages to 
dissimilar parts of the world. 
Social media, in this sense, serves 
as a spyglass that illuminates 
different ways of doing things. 
This technology is impacting lives 
more than previously imagined 
possible, and some have begun 
to investigate what these social 
media platforms are doing with 
this new responsibility.
Twitter has recently come 
under fire for the process with 
which it arbitrates the banning 
of tweets. Some say it is an issue 
of political bias. Others find fault 
with the fact that these decisions 
to censor the free expressions of 
others in a global arena are made 
not by elected officials in our 
government, but by a corporation, 
and more specifically, by an 
unelected, 
often 
politically 
biased individual employee. In 
an interview with CNN’s Brian 
Stelter, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey 
stated, “I think we need to 

constantly show that we are not 
adding our own bias, which I fully 
admit is left, is more 
left-leaning.” That said, 
Dorsey also admitted 
Twitter is so liberal 
that 
conservative 
employees “don’t feel 
safe to express their 
opinions.” Recently, on 
the podcast “The Joe 
Rogan 
Experience,” 
independent journalist 
Tim Pool squared off 
against Dorsey and 
Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s global lead 
for legal, policy and trust and safety, 
on issues of alleged censorship 
and lack of transparency. One of 
Pool’s recurring questions was 
why the platform was treating 
users differently for their political 
leanings. 
When 
Dorsey 
and 
Gadde assured they only manage 
behaviors on their platform and not 
opinions, Pool gave evidence of the 
contrary.
Pool offered as evidence the 
overwhelming number of Twitter 
suspensions 
for 
right-leaning 
users combined with the lack 
of punishments for users on the 
political left. Pool listed numerous 
renowned commenters on the right 
spectrum like Milo Yiannopoulos, 
Gavin McInnes and Alex Jones 

who have been banned completely 
from the platform for their tweet 
content that was either deemed 
“hate speech” or “didn’t conform 
to Twitter standards.” Pool then 
contrasted 
this 
with 
several 
shocking posts by left-leaning 
participants that went unpunished. 
Antifa, a militant opposition to 
fascism and other forms of extreme 
right-wing 
ideology, 
published 
tweets with a “list of 1,600 ICE 
employees 
alongside 
photos, 
locations, and job titles,” some of 
which have still yet to be deleted 
at the time of this podcast despite 
their qualification as doxxing.
Comedian and actress Kathy 
Griffin first posed in a photograph 
holding a mockup of President 
Donald Trump’s severed head 
and more recently called for the 
doxxing of the Covington High 
School students, saying, “Name 
these kids. I want NAMES. 
Shame them.” Griffin suffered 
no punishment or suspension 
because of her actions. Pool 
also cited a Twitter user that 
tweeted three times calling for 
the killing of the Covington High 
School students and again faced 
no suspension or ban. Users 
proposing the beheading of the 
president or the burning alive of 
children suffered no sanctions, 
while those who promoted certain 
right-leaning positions, such as 
refusing to refer to transgender 
users by their correct pronouns, 
were routinely suspended. Pool 
asked Dorsey, “Why does it always 
feel like your policies are going one 
direction politically? Twitter is 
slowly gaining… too much control 
from your personal ideology based 
on what you’ve researched, what 
you think is right, over American 
discourse.”
Pool argues that Twitter’s 
rule controlling how users refer 
to transgender people with risk of 
suspension is evidence of Twitter 

using ideologically driven policies. 
Even if you agree with the rule, 
you might be able to see that it 
necessarily takes a stance on the 
issue of free speech, a stance 
that many conservative users 
of the platform disagree with. 
But where are the roots of this 
control? Pool argues that, because 
Twitter doesn’t follow the United 
States’ legal behaviors toward 
free speech and instead opts for 
a Constitutionally unrecognized 
hate speech regulation to curb 
harassment, it often comes down 
to an individual Twitter employee 
sitting at a screen and deciding 
if a post is allowed or not. This 
seems arbitrary, considering the 
conscious and unconscious bias 
from Twitter staff and other 
Silicon Valley personnel that might 
unfairly tilt the dialogue in one 
direction. U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, 
R-Calif., recently sued Twitter 
for $250 million for their alleged 
“shadow banning” of conservative 
users, as well as an alleged personal 
smear campaign. Again, politics 
aside, it’s important to note the 
control these platforms have over 
the expressions of free-thinking 
users.
Similar to Twitter’s issue of 
political 
censorship, 
Facebook 
has recently faced criticism for 
the inappropriate handling of its 
users’ personal information, with 
Zuckerberg 
testifying 
before 
Congress on the subject of data 
privacy. In December of last year, 
The New York Times reported 
that Facebook has been giving 
users’ personal data to tech giants 
like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and 
Microsoft. Netflix and Spotify, 
video-on-demand 
and 
music 
giants respectively, were given 
access to read Facebook users’ 
private messages, while tech 
giants Microsoft and Amazon 
were given lists of Facebook users’ 
friends and contact information. 
While Zuckerberg was quick 
to 
argue 
that 
all 
Facebook 
users agree to a “Terms of Use” 
allowing such sale of personal 
and private information, these 
agreements imply compensation 
and verge on the Orwellian.
Netflix and Spotify now 
have the ability to strip-mine all 
kinds of personal information 
from Facebook users’ private 
conversations, such as your plans 
to move to a new neighborhood, 
your salary, the status of your 
relationship with your spouse 
and even your best-kept secrets. 
It’s then up to the individual to 
trust a global corporation with 
the proper application of his or 
her highly sensitive information. 
The Wall Street Journal’s article 
“Can a Facebook Post Make 
Your Insurance Cost More?” 
examines a potential future 
where posting pictures of a 
rock-climbing jaunt or alcoholic 
indulgence could impact your 
life-insurance premiums. These 
stories 
perfectly 
articulate 
the risk and burden that these 
platforms place on its users 
by collecting their personal 
information.
Privacy and free expression 
on the internet are on the 
line because of the actions of 
Facebook and Twitter. They 
don’t need to go much further 
to blur the freedoms of everyday 
Americans. Next time you log 
on to Twitter or Facebook, ask 
yourself, 
“What 
information 
about myself am I giving up by 
participating here and what will 
they allow me to say?”

O

n Friday, March 15 
some 3,000 students 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan and high 
schools in the Ann 
Arbor area gathered 
on the Diag as a 
part of the Global 
Climate Strike. The 
strike was inspired 
by Swedish teenager 
Greta 
Thunberg, 
now nominated for 
a Nobel Peace Prize, 
and was a coordinated effort 
by students internationally to 
walk out of classes and demand 
action on climate change. 
In Ann Arbor, the rally was 
followed by a march around 
campus, with its final stop at 
the Fleming Administration 
Building 
where 
protesters 
sat 
for 
a 
peaceful 
sit-in. 
Organizers of the strike had a 
list of demands for University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel, 
but 
understood 
he 
would 
be 
unable 
to 
immediately 
commit to a blanket list of 
demands. 
The 
protesters’ 
primary goal was to create 
a dialogue with Schlissel, 
where he would agree to a 
public meeting in order to 
discuss the University’s role 
in combating climate change 
openly. The sit-in lasted seven 
and a half hours. However, it 
did not go according to plan.
Instead of talking with 
the students or agreeing to 
a public meeting at a later 
date, 
administrators, 
and 
eventually 
police, 
asked 
students 
to 
leave. 
When 
they refused to move and 
demanded their voices be 
heard, administrators called 
the police and 10 students 
were arrested for trespassing, 
including two minors from 
local high schools.
The 
handling 
of 
these 
peaceful 
protesters 
highlights 
the 
consistent 
lack 
of 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
from 
the 
administration 
on 
its 
commitment 
to 
acting 
on 
climate change.
The turnout of the strike 
shows how important this 
issue is to the local community 

and 
students 
and 
the 
subsequent sit-in emphasizes 
the 
commitment 
students 
at 
our 
university 
have 
to climate justice. 
Back in November, 
many students and 
faculty 
applauded 
Schlissel 
as 
he 
announced 
he 
would put together 
a 
commission 
on 
carbon 
neutrality. 
Today, 
we 
are 
simply 
asking 
he 
make 
the 
process 
transparent 
and commit to serious and 
effective deadlines.
I reached out to participants 
in the strike and peaceful 
protests for comments on how 
they view the situation. LSA 
senior Olivia Perfetti, one of the 
10 students arrested following 
the sit-in, is the policy chair 
for 2018-19 for Students for 
Clean Energy, a cosponsor of 
the Washtenaw Climate Strike. 
In an email interview with 
The Daily, Perfetti commented 
what went through her mind 
when she heard the University 
call the police.
“I want to emphasize how 
reasonable our request was: a 
one-hour public meeting with 
President Schlissel moderated 
by a student. This meeting was 
necessary 
because 
previous 
meetings have all taken place 
behind closed doors, been off 
the record, had moderators 
who 
filtered 
questions 
or 
excluded discussion about the 
Central Power Plant (CPP) 
expansion 
and 
divestment 
from fossil fuels. We agreed to 
leave on this condition and felt 
sure that our request would 
be granted because it was so 
straightforward.”
She 
continued: 
“What 
possible reason could President 
Schlissel have for refusing? I 
personally was certain that he 
would agree rather than have 
so many young people arrested. 
Clearly, I was wrong. I probably 
should 
have 
been 
nervous 
when the arrests started.” 
Perfetti continued, outlining 
how she ended up feeling 
calm: “First, being with other 
organizers gave me a strong 

sense of solidarity: This is the 
power of collective action. And 
second, the unreasonableness 
of President Schlissel’s refusal 
strengthened my conviction 
to stay. I had no doubt that we 
were in the right, so I had no 
trouble standing my ground.”
Naina 
Agrawal-Hardin, 
a 
16-year-old 
student 
at 
Washtenaw 
International 
High 
School, 
was 
a 
lead 
organizer for the Washtenaw 
County Climate Strike and 
speaker at the event. She said 
in an interview that due to 
travel plans, she was unable 
to attend the sit-in, but kept 
in 
constant 
communication 
with the participants. “When 
we found out that police were 
being called, I was amazed 
at how calm everyone stayed. 
It portrayed how much they 
were willing to sacrifice for 
this cause. I know people were 
scared, but to me, from the 
outside, it almost seemed like 
their 
resolve 
strengthened, 
and it was clear that they 
weren’t going to give up.”
The events of March 15 
should be a wake-up call 
to everyone sitting on the 
sidelines 
about 
climate 
action. Students like Perfetti 
and Agrawal-Hardin are an 
inspiration to the rest of us to 
stand up for what we believe 
and not to compromise on what 
is right.

The 
University’s 

decision to avoid and deflect 
accountability is a travesty 
and it needs to do a better 
job 
communicating 
with 
students. It is unacceptable 
that Schlissel continues on 
without any direct interaction 
with 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
community. 
The 
University 
claims it is committed to 
fighting climate change and 
going 
carbon 
neutral, 
yet 
refuses to set clearly defined 
and easily measurable goals for 
this endeavor. But this cannot 
be the case forever. The people 
have spoken, and the time 
to act decisively on climate 
change is now.

Social media’s oversized issues

‘U’ severely lacks transparency and accoutability on climate action

New Zealand could teach us a thing or two
N

ew Zealand’s largest 
mass 
shooting 
took 
place at two mosques, 
the Al Noor Mosque and the 
Linwood Islamic Center, in 
Christchurch, killing 50 people 
and injuring another 50 on the 
Muslim holy day, Friday, March 
15. Before the shooting took 
place, the suspect released a 
document detailing far-right, 
nationalistic views targeting 
Muslims and immigrants.
After this gruesome event, 
Jacinda 
Ardern, 
the 
prime 
minister 
of 
New 
Zealand, 
immediately sprang into action. 
She banned all military-style 
semi-automatic 
guns 
and 
assault rifles and has created 
a government buyback system 
to get rid of those already in 
circulation, which will cost 
the 
government 
between 
$100 and $200 million in New 
Zealand dollars. Though the 
total number of banned guns 
is unknown, of the 1.5 million 
guns in circulation, more than 
13,500 are now banned. Owners 
are expected to turn those guns 
in and will be reimbursed. If 
they do not comply, they could 
receive up to three years in 
prison. And this is just the first 
step.
Most citizens are in complete 
agreement about the necessity 
for this action, including gun 
owners. John Overand told 
NPR the new gun laws are a 
“good idea.” He went on: “I’m 
a farmer and I’ve got guns, but 
just for pests and things like 
that. But semi-automatics aren’t 
what you use for shooting pests, 
they’re for killing people.”
Even 
those 
in 
the 
gun 
industry are taking action. Some 
gun sellers took all weapons off 
the shelf the day of attack and 
stopped selling high capacity 
magazines. A manager of a rifle 
range shut down his gun club to 
show respect for the victims.
People all around the world 
are praising New Zealand’s quick 
and effective action. Rebecca 

Peters, an activist who lead 
gun law reforms in Australia 
in the 1990s, said: “It’s been 
the fastest response ever by a 
government after a tragedy.” 
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted: “This 
is what leadership looks like,” 
reminding others that Sandy 
Hook took place six years ago 
and the United States still does 
not have universal background 
checks. 
U.S. 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., challenged the 
U.S. to follow in New Zealand’s 
footsteps, saying, “This is what 
real action to stop gun violence 
looks like.”

And yet, little change has 
been enacted here in the United 
States, where gun violence has 
been a much more widespread 
issue. The U.S. has experienced 
162 mass shootings since 1966, 
according to The Washington 
Post. 
They’ve 
taken 
place 
everywhere from schools to 
movie theaters, killing everyone 
from children to the elderly. 
Afterward, 
the 
nation 
is 
outraged for a couple months, 
sometimes a little longer. We 
cry for change but are ignored. 
Soon the cries begin to die out 
due to inaction. Then the cycle 
is repeated over and over again.
Thankfully, we’ve recently 
been granted a ban on bump 
stocks, and the Supreme Court 
seems set on keeping that ban 
in place, rejecting the second 
bid to end the ban in three 
days. This action is a step in 
the right direction, but it’s not 

enough. We don’t have national 
bans on assault weapons, only 
restrictions in a few states. We 
don’t have universal background 
checks. We don’t have enough 
forms of protection against 
what is supposed to protect us.
New Zealand is not burdened 
by 
the 
Second 
Amendment 
like the United States. In New 
Zealand, 
owning 
a 
gun 
is 
considered “a privilege and not 
a right,” as Stuart Nash, New 
Zealand police minister, said. 
They also don’t have to deal 
with a powerful National Rifle 
Association pushing back on any 
safety initiatives. Dana Loesch, 
a spokeswoman for the NRA, 
wrote on Twitter, “The US isn’t 
NZ. While they do not have an 
inalienable right to bear arms 
and to self-defense, we do.” 
While this is a true statement, 
it does not give us the excuse to 
be irresponsible with our rights. 
Maybe it’s not possible to take as 
dramatic forms of action as New 
Zealand did, or to pass it as fast, 
but that doesn’t give the U.S. an 
excuse to do nothing.
When a national tragedy 
occurs, 
a 
government 
is 
supposed to take action. A 
government is supposed to take 
care of its citizens, not allow 
its citizens to be slaughtered 
time and time again while it 
stands idly by. A government is 
supposed to act. That is exactly 
what New Zealand did and why 
they are being praised for their 
actions by others who recognize 
its 
importance. 
They 
have 
responded to tragedy with quick 
and effective action – and we 
should do the same.
How many more? How many 
more shootings will it take for 
the U.S. to wake up and take 
action? One hundred and sixty-
three? Two hundred? Because 
we know what New Zealand’s 
answer is. Zero.

Tuesday, April 2, 2019 — 5

Given my relatively vanilla 
cinematic taste to begin with, 
both the short film “Landscape 
of Absence” and feature film 
“<3” 
pushed 
my 
personal 
definition of art and proved a bit 
challenging to digest. Though 
I can’t say that either film left 
me wanting more, both exposed 
me to an unfamiliar genre and 
made for an interesting (to say 
the least) hour and a half.
“Landscape of Absence” can 
best be described as a thought-
provoking immersion into a 
compilation 
of 
dialogue-less 
moments of iconic women in 
cinema. 
The 
film 
expertly 
utilizes a split screen to parallel 
the 
facial 
expressions 
and 
movements of a woman in 
one screen to the similar 
expressions or movements 
of 
the 
woman 
in 
the 
other. 
For 
instance, 
we 
watch 
Sigourney 
Weaver 
looking surprised in one 
of the “Alien” films, while 
simultaneously 
observing 
Frances McDormand’s face 
plastered with an almost 
identical 
expression 
in 
“Fargo.” 
Despite 
these 
parallels, for the majority 
of the film, most of the clips 
are seemingly unrelated and 
we find ourselves unsure of 
the connections between the 
women shown.
The visual component is the 
most captivating part of the 
film, but sound is emphasized 
more 
subtly. 
Interspersed 
snippets 
of 
simple, 
yet 
un-contextualized phrases like 
“where are we” are thrown in, 
but there is no actual dialogue. 
In the final moments of the 
film, a black title screen finally 
reveals the common thread we 
have been searching for over 
the past 10 minutes, projecting 
the 
message 
that 
none 
of 
the scenes selected “feature 
protagonists 
communicating 

with each other.” This minimal 
use of speaking, both in the 
overhead audio and in the clips 
from within the various movies 
shown, leads to the overall, 
cleverly 
demonstrated 
point 
that females on screen are not 
given enough of a voice.
Though a relevant criticism 
of on-screen gender biases, I 
couldn’t help but feel bothered 
by the lack of actresses of color 
depicted. Of the approximate 
15 to 20 scenes with a white 
actress, there were no more 
than 
three 
with 
a 
Black 
actress. This illuminates the 
troubling 
reality 
that 
even 
within the noble cause of 
female representation, there is 

underrepresentation.
A complete change of pace 
from “Landscape of Absence,” 
if you couldn’t already infer 
from 
the 
title 
structure, 
“<3,” refuses to adhere to any 
form 
of 
convention. 
Boldly 
and explicitly exploring the 
intersection between the self, 
the digital world and drugs, 
this is a film that will make your 
eyes pop and your ears ring like 
you’re listening to a late 2000s 
Kesha hit.
Pill-popper, 
rapper 
and 
unfiltered millennial LNZ is 
like no other protagonist, if you 
can even call her a protagonist 
at all. She exists as more of a 
persona in a music video than 
anything else, swearing left 

and right in her electric, anger-
fueled raps and accompanied 
by a trio of three practically 
incapacitated 
and 
prop-like 
men, who are later revealed to 
be her intended assassins (if 
this sounds weird and doesn’t 
really 
make 
sense, 
that’s 
because it was and it really 
doesn’t). You could say that 
the plot of the film is for LNZ 
to confront who is trying to 
kill her, but that would give 
the misleading impression that 
this film follows any sort of 
direction at all.
LNZ’s purpose as a character 
is not for audiences to connect 
to 
or 
understand. 
She 
is 
messy, debilitated by pills and 
completely 
unreliable. 
But 
perhaps that is the point of the 
film, to show the psychological 
power of hard drugs through 
LNZ’s unhinged nature and 
inhuman behaviors.
She basically lives in two 
different 
worlds 
(literally, 
there are scenes with her 
flying around in a recliner in 
outer space). Though difficult 
to definitely conclude from the 
chaotic and drug-infused aura 
that hangs over the entirety of 
the movie, there are seemingly 
two types of scenes in the film. 
On the one, there are moments 
from LNZ’s perspective, shot 
through a first-person, shaky 
camera. Then there are scenes 
where the audience is watching 
LNZ as they would a character 
in a video game, noticing the 
three <3s in the corner of 
the screen that represent her 
“lives.” Both portrayals of LNZ 
shape her into more of a thing 
than a human being and feed 
into the overall digitized vibe 
that surrounds the film. 
It’s a mindbender in itself 
to try to distinguish how to 
feel after seeing this film. In 
the strangest way possible, 
the wide range of camera 

movements and perspectives, 
moody lighting and colors and 
interspersed animated elements 
somehow come together to 
create a final product that is 
undeniably artistic. That said, 
this film is a lot to take in 
one sitting. Ultimately, it’s an 
uncomfortable and borderline 
psychologically 
violating 
sensory overload that dumps 
a lot of drugs, heavy rap and 
obscenity into our laps and 
unfairly expects us to have a 
clue of what to do with it.

“Phantom 
Ride 
Phantom,” 
an 
experimental 
Austrian short film 
that 
preceded 
my 
feature presentation 
at 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Film Festival, was a 
flashing, 
pulsating 
collage 
of 
nature. 
Completely devoid of 
dialogue, characters 
or narrative, the short 
flipped 
endlessly 
between an initial image of 
railroad tracks and random 
woodlands 
with 
assaulting 
editing, a creepy synth score, 
and the obscure sound of a train 
trundling along its path. The 
experience was far more jarring 
than enjoyable, but there was 
something to be gained from 
the visceral interrogation into 
how humans control and are 
controlled by our environment. 
If “Phantom Ride Phantom” 
offers any clear takeaway, it’s 
that our manipulation of the 
natural world is inherently 
destructive to the environment, 
and ultimately, to ourselves.
After the pointed imagery 
of the short film faded, the 
documentary 
“Caballerango” 

began. 
The 
film, 
directed 
by 
Juan 
Pablo 
González 
(“Las Nubes”) examines the 
emotional state and daily life 
of a small rural Mexican town 
after a beloved horse wrangler, 
Nando, tragically takes his 
own life. While “Caballerango” 
moves slowly, surveying the 
man’s parents, siblings and 
coworkers, the film’s truth 
emerges profoundly toward its 
conclusion.
The 
simplicity 
of 
the 
camerawork, whether it be a 
long take of a farmer driving 
his pickup, a shot of two men 
eating that perfectly captures 
the shadows across their faces, 
or an entire scene from the 

windowsill of a kitchen, is 
an intimate exploration the 
nuances of daily life in this 
town with striking intimacy. 
The director often chooses 
to juxtapose people in their 
natural state against landscapes 
of remarkably golden fields and 
hills. Despite not keeping the 
camera directly on his subjects, 
González expertly telegraphs 
their energy, adoration and 
grief.
Some of the family members’ 
testimony 
was 
genuinely 
heartbreaking. The way that 
the Nando’s brother described 
his mother’s reaction to seeing 
her son’s suicide was not only a 
painfully detailed account, but 
one that made me feel as though 

I knew this family. For an 
instant, all of that grief seemed 
to swell in my mind with the 
same intensity as it appeared on 
the brother’s visage.
The discussion of the horse 
wrangler’s passing broadened 
to 
an 
understanding 
that 
death is simply a part of life 
for 
many 
members 
of 
the 
town. Death hangs over the 
film like a shadow, in images 
of chickens being slaughtered 
and prepared to eat, and in 
bleary, heatwaves that cross 
freshly harvested cornfields. 
The longer I watched, the more 
this insistence of mortality 
subsumed the film’s message.
And yet, González turned 
this 
dark 
quality 
into 
something 
beautiful. 
Beyond 
the tragedy at the 
film’s 
heart, 
the 
director ultimately 
depicts death not 
as an obstacle that 
must 
swallowed 
away, but instead 
a 
hallowed 
event 
through 
which 
one finds a sense 
of 
peace. 
This 
particular wisdom is etched 
upon 
nearly 
every 
face 
in the film, as a common 
understanding 
of 
the 
townspeople.
The themes of “Phantom” 
and 
“Caballerango” 
started 
to converge. They both speak 
powerful 
truths 
about 
the 
freedom and limits of human 
control, in a physical, survivalist 
sense, but in the context of 
personal relationships. While 
the choice to pair the two 
films together was initially 
unclear, their thematic and 
visual overlap is fascinating to 
consider.

Let’s get it on: ‘You’re The 
Man’ reintroduces Gaye

MOTOWN

In preparation to write this 
review and at a loss for how 
to tackle the insurmountable 
legacy 
of 
Marvin 
Gaye, 
I 
did what anyone would do: I 
called my father. I called my 
father and I asked him, “What 
do you think about Marvin 
Gaye?” In response, he 
immediately sent me 
a Spotify link to the 
classic “Got To Give It 
Up (Part 1),” and told 
me: “This is the stuff. 
Be 
careful. 
It’s 
like 
mainlining heroin.”
Well, as much as 
it pains any child to 
admit it, my father’s 
not wrong. In fact, this 
may be the one and only 
exception where I have 
the guts to say, he’s 
really, really right.
Marvin Gaye’s music 
is a lot of things. He was 
(and still is) “The Prince 
of Motown,” a master of soul, 
R&B, with touches of jazz and 
the sing-song of the crooners, 
like Gaye’s idol Sam Cooke. His 
legacy has been formed by his 
battle with his inner demons, 

his revolutionary and socially 
conscious 
music 
and 
his 
confidence to break barriers, to 
break rules.
But to try and describe the 
depth of Gaye’s music-making 
through a list of things, of facts, 
would be a dishonor to his 
legacy. Words can’t (and won’t) 
ever properly capture the magic 
that is Marvin Gaye. To listen 
to Marvin Gaye’s music is to 

have what I can only describe 
as a spiritual awakening. 
However, 
even 
though 
words may be insufficient to 
capture the essence of Marvin 
Gaye’s music, this writer feels 

obligated to try. If only to 
entertain the possibility that 
the reader will see, hear and 
feel these words somewhere 
deep, go home and go listen to 
Marvin Gaye.
First and foremost, to listen 
to Marvin Gaye sing is the 
closest thing to true and pure 
happiness one can find on 
this Earth. Sure, there are a 
lot of good things in life: Cake 
is good. Love is good, 
too. Yeah, financial or 
social success is okay, 
I guess. But Marvin 
Gaye? Marvin Gaye is 
life itself. To listen to 
Marvin Gaye’s music 
is to be torn between 
sinking 
into 
bone-
deep 
relaxation 
or 
jumping up and dancing 
until your feet fall off 
and keep on dancing 
without you. To listen to 
Marvin Gaye is to face 
the agony of thinking, 
“Wait, there are people 
who walk this Earth 
who have never listened 
to Marvin Gaye?” and know the 
answer is yes.
Marvin Gaye’s posthumous 
album 
You’re 
The 
Man 
is 
all this and much more. In 
honor of what would’ve been 

Marvin Gaye’s 80th birthday, 
MOTOWN 
has 
released 
a 
compilation 
of 
what 
were 
considered to be “lost” songs. 
The album, at its inception, 
was meant to be a follow up to 
Gaye’s beloved album, What’s 
Going On, but was ultimately 
never released due to clashes 
with the label and lackluster 
reception 
of 
a 
preliminary 
release of the title song. Gaye 
was 
never 
afraid 
to 
push 
boundaries or showcase his 
vulnerabilities — the release of 
this album after all this time 
is a testament to Gaye’s legacy 
of deep, honest and emotional 
music-making.
The album features a few 
remixes by producer Salaam 
Remi — songs that are good, but 
with little to offer in alternative 
to the original versions. Then 
again, when it comes to Marvin 
Gaye, it’s nearly impossible to 
improve upon what is already a 

masterwork of musical genius. 
And overall, the album itself 
isn’t daring or shocking. There 
are no pretentious attempts 
by the label to pretend that 
You’re The Man is anything 
but what is it: Marvin Gaye. 
One should not sit down to 
this album expecting radical 
experimentation. Rather, the 
album is like warmly greeting 
an old friend who’s been gone 
far too long. For the long-time 
fan, it’s like feeling warm 
sunshine after a long, hard 
winter. For the newcomers, 
it’s a treasure-chest discovery 
of 
small 
proportions, 
with 
lasting impact. Once one has 
been 
introduced 
to 
Gaye’s 
brand of chill vibes and soulful 
optimism, it’s impossible to go 
back.
What is most striking about 
the album, however, is not 
the discovery of these hidden 
songs, nor the enjoyment of 

hearing dearly-missed friend, 
idol and artist sing once more. 
No, what is most striking about 
You’re The Man is how different 
it is from the music of today. 
When sitting outside on the 
streets of Ann Arbor, lavishing 
in the brief glimpse of spring 
and listening to Marvin Gaye, 
one word came to mind: happy. 
Because no matter how serious, 
insightful or vulnerable Gaye’s 
music can be, there is always 
a light, comforting touch in 
accompaniment. It is refreshing 
to listen to this timeless music 
made by a man who saw the 
world for what it was — good 
and bad — and sought to capture 
the vital truths of life within 
his music. In the monotony of 
modern music, and the crush 
of endless expectation and 
obligation, one impression still 
lingers: how wonderful it is to 
welcome Marvin Gaye home, if 
for the last time.

Ty Segall’s new album begins 
with four words, so soft and 
so 
quickly 
interrupted 
that 
they’re easy to miss: “Ladies and 
gentlemen, the—”
That’s it. Then, there are the 
guitars.
It’s quite the hook, and “Warm 
Hands” is an almost impossible 
song to turn off, once you’re 
sucked into it. The lyrics tell an 
enthralling story — “He said he 
wanted to talk to me / ‘Come here, 
let me take you home’ / My hands, 
they feel warm / My car 
can run” — and the guitars 
are so pressing, they evoke 
the feeling of, yes, getting 
into a car with somebody 
else driving, and then 
realizing too late what 
you’ve signed on for once 
you’re hurtling down the 
freeway at 100 miles an hour.
It’s hard to know what to expect 
from an artist like Segall. In a little 
over a decade of music-making, the 
California multi-instrumentalist 
has flexed his muscles in several 
entirely different directions, from 
the early lo-fi garage rock of early 
albums like the first Ty Segall and 
Goodbye Bread to the intentionally 
freeform explorations of his most 
recent record-length effort, last 
year’s Freedom’s Goblin. He’s 
proven himself to be among the 
most prolific artists currently 
making 
music, 
putting 
out 
practically an album a year, and 
occasionally even more.

His newest record, Deforming 
Lobes, is a live album recorded last 
year at the Teragram Ballroom 
in Los Angeles. It features songs 
plucked from all corners of 
Segall’s musical repertoire, from 
2010’s Melted to his second self-
titled album, released in 2017. 
Segall’s approach to the live album 
seems to focus on one aspect while 
discarding any elements he deems 
unnecessary, including the fuzzy 
applause and cheering that artists 
usually leave in at the end of each 
track (to the effect of feeling like 
you’re at the concert), as well 
as any songs that wouldn’t have 
benefited the record.

Namely, Segall — already no 
stranger to long or unusual track 
lengths — capitalizes on the 
ways in which live tracks can 
expand and grow beyond their 
original span. The closing track, 
“Love Fuzz,” features perhaps 
one of the best examples of this, 
a prolonged section of chiming 
that evokes alien abduction and 
grows sharper and sharper as it 
dwindles, coaxing the listener 
into near-hypnosis before finally 
exploding back into the static 
and intense instrumentation that 
kicked off the meat of the track 
initially.
The crowning element of the 

album’s character has to be the 
Freedom Band, made up of Mikal 
Cronin (bass), Charles Moothart 
(drums), Emmett Kelly (guitar) 
and Ben Boye (piano). Guitars 
don’t sing like this everywhere. 
The album is only eight tracks 
long, making for a very tightly 
packed 35 minutes, so it’s hard to 
pick standouts knowing that we’re 
already experiencing the cream 
of the crop. But “Warm Hands,” 
the opening track and the longest 
one on the album at almost 10 
minutes, 
practically 
demands 
that the listener give the other 
seven songs a listen, too. “Cherry 
Red” features an instrumental 
section that threatens 
to blow its own top off. 
One almost wonders 
whether the applause 
and shouts of the 
audience 
members 
were done away with 
because they simply 
would have added too 
much extreme dimension to an 
album already bursting with it.
The album is all about reining 
in chaos into something distilled 
and singularly creative. Each 
track is a live performance at a 
show, and yet the recordings are 
largely honed back to the music 
itself, to the point that at times the 
album sounds like a more frenetic 
version of a studio effort (in a good 
way). The music itself sounds 
purposeful, yet totally unbridled, 
infused with a sense of prehistoric 
rock that comes back and back to 
us throughout the ages, surfacing 
over and over again in new ways.

“On My Block,” Netflix’s most 
binge-watched show of 2018, is 
back with its second season, a 
return that can only be described 
as a charming portrayal of 
young-minded teens facing real-
life problems. The show self-
actualizes into the framework 
of the show it was supposed to 
be in the first season — a show 
about 
soul-searching 
high 
school freshmen that struggle 
with childhood trauma, external 
pressures to act a certain way 
and now, how to handle 
all 
that 
Rollerworld 
loot that Jamal (Brett 
Gray, 
“Chicago 
P.D.”) 
discovered in the first 
season.
The 
new 
season 
picks up a few months 
after the aggravatingly nerve-
wracking cliffhanger of the 
first season, and viewers were 
finally given the chance to find 
out the fate of our beloved Ruby 
(Jason Genao, “Logan”) and 
Olivia (Ronni Hawk, “S.W.A.T.”). 
Despite the first season finale’s 
downer ending, the show never 
neglects its lighthearted nature 
and its refreshingly comedic 
view on topics that are not 
always supposed to be funny. It’s 
hilariously relevant, especially 
in the scene where Ruby comes 
back to school and all of his 
peers want to take selfies with 
his 
scarred 
bullet 
wound. 
The show switches smoothly 

between serious political issues 
that come with being stuck in a 
bad neighborhood and ridiculous 
drama that all high schoolers 
inevitably experience at some 
point in their life.
The biggest improvement is 
that the characters find deeper 
realms of dimensionality than 
they had in their first season, 
especially as they go through 
the stages of grief from losing 
their new friend Olivia from 
gang violence. Monse (Sierra 
Capri, debut) interacts with the 
woman who she suspects is her 
biological mother, Cesar (Diego 
Tinoco, “Teen Wolf”) struggles 

through 
rejection 
from 
his 
brother and the constant threat 
of homelessness and Jamal deals 
with the repercussions of having 
a cursed fortune on his hands. 
Although every character sees 
some semblance of development 
in the new season, it is Ruby 
and Jazmine (Jessica Marie 
Garcia, “How to Get Away with 
Murder”) who are able to show 
the most depth. Ruby suffers 
through 
anxiety 
and 
PTSD 
episodes from facing a near-
death experience, and we are 
finally able to see Jazmine’s 
full three-dimensionality when 
Ruby visits her home and sees 
what makes her the way she is. 

We also get to see new 
character dynamics that we 
didn’t get in the first season. 
The most amusing of them all 
was Jamal and Cesar, who are 
forced to stay together when 
Cesar has nowhere else to go. 
Jamal’s energetic nervousness 
contrasted 
against 
Cesar’s 
cool kid attitude makes for an 
entertaining few episodes and 
brings 
the 
ride-or-die 
crew 
closer together than ever before.
While nobody can resist the 
addictive charm of the crew’s 
energy, at times the high school 
drama feels a bit too timely and 
predictable. If the showrunners 
could 
focus 
on 
diversifying 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
teen drama to match 
the creativity of the 
primary 
storylines, 
then the show has 
a good chance of 
running for at least another 
few seasons. Despite this, it 
is appreciated that this show 
experiments with new kinds 
of twists and turns that don’t 
consist of the typical “small 
quiet town faces big mysterious 
murder” narrative. The second 
season fills in the gaps between 
the 
characters 
and 
their 
struggles 
that 
were 
present 
throughout the first season, 
and viewers can only hope 
that Netflix sees that obvious 
potential that the show offers 
and hits the “renewal” button 
until their hands go numb. After 
the chilling way season one 
ended, we desperately need it.

SOPHIA YOON
For The Daily

Throughout my time at college, 
my perception of what “good” 
writing is has changed immensely. 
Before college, writing was a hobby. 
I enjoyed the simple act of writing; it 
was natural to me. I wasn’t holding 
myself to any standard or abiding 
by any rules. My writing was a full 
expression of myself, uninfluenced 
by “great” literature or renowned 
writers or publication guidelines. 
I was sometimes praised for my 
writing and encouraged to formally 
pursue writing in my education.
I eventually did decide to formally 
pursue writing, and have been 
doing so for the past three years. I’ve 
taken many workshop classes at the 
University of Michigan as well as 
New York University. I’ve attended 
countless 
writing 
conferences, 
readings and events. I’ve written a 
number of essay collections that I 
still can’t believe I finished. I’ve won 
some awards and have come close 
to winning others.
Somehow, though, I feel like less 
of a writer than I was at 17.
My experience with writing 
sometimes 
feels 
surreal, 
even 
though I haven’t, by any terms, 
“made it” as a writer. I began as a 
girl with a journal in her nightstand 
drawer, and now, somehow, I’m 
here. I’ve heard accomplished 
writers speak and I have worked 
closely with many of them. I’ve 
learned what to write and when, 
how to get published and where. 
I’ve 
written 
and 
edited 
and 
re-written and re-edited pieces. 
I’ve completed this cycle so many 
times that some of my work doesn’t 
even feel like mine. I’ve learned so 
much about writing that sometimes 

I forget how to write; I’m paralyzed 
by the thought of flow and tone and 
recognition, which I’ve internalized 
as the singular pillar of artistic 
accomplishment.
I’ve lost touch with myself 
as an artist in the pressure to be 
a “good” writer by the implicit 
standards of literary achievement 
— standards that, after many 
nights of frustration, agony and 
subsequent 
soul-searching, 
I’ve 
decided are illusory on the premise 
of their elitism. Literary knowledge, 
allusions and inclusion in high-
brow social groups — Fitzgerald, 
Capote, Didion – have played a 
role in shaping these standards, 
while living in complete isolation 
and selling your soul to the craft of 
writing (in conjunction with illicit 
substances) has, too — Hemingway, 
Salinger, Thoreau.
In other words, the road to 
literary success has been defined, 
and, to most, is unavailable.
***
On Thursdays, I go to Cotton 
Correctional Facility in Jackson. 
I facilitate a creative writing 
workshop 
with 
three 
other 
members of the Prison Creative 
Arts Project for incarcerated men. 
We push the tables in the classroom 
together and sit in a circle. We play 
games, do writing exercises and 
share our pieces with each other. 
For every piece shared comes a 
round of poetry snapping and warm 
smiles, compassionate head shakes 
or intelligent feedback, regardless 
of whether it’s positive or negative.
Before I’d gone to Cotton, when 
I’d told my friends and family about 
the workshop I’d be facilitating, 
they’d assured me that I’d teach the 
men a lot. They knew that I knew 
how to write — I’d been doing it 
forever, and I’d studied the craft 

extensively. But I was never under 
the impression that I had anything 
to teach these men. In fact, I knew 
I’d be the one learning.
I was right in knowing that I 
didn’t have anything to offer the 
men, aside from giving them the 
space to express themselves. What 
I didn’t anticipate, though, was the 
amount of wisdom and passion and 
knowledge that they have shown 
me. It’s one thing to learn from 
something, but it’s another to have 
it change you — which is what the 
men at Cotton did.
In 
that 
classroom, 
I’ve 
encountered the most powerful 
writing I’ve read. These men have 
faced 
nearly 
insurmountable 
adversity. 
They’ve 
experienced 
enough pain for 10 lifetimes. 
They’ve been robbed of resources 
that I, and many of my peers, have 
had access to our whole lives. And 
they’re the best artists I’ve ever met.
The men at Cotton have stripped 
the art of writing down to its 
essence. Its essence is not elite — it’s 
not knowledge or culture or even 
recognition. It’s genuineness. Their 
writing is magnetic, organic.
Through their authenticity, these 
men have inspired me to become 
who I am, both as a writer and as a 
person. Because of them, what I’ve 
been taught about what writing is 
supposed to be is unraveling. The 
best writers are the ones who are 
fully themselves.
Because of them, I’ve decided 
to forget what I know and become 
the writer I was at 17. Because of 
them, I’ve realized that the best art 
is often not celebrated, because it’s 
raw, messy and imperfect. The best 
writing doesn’t adhere to a standard 
or yearn for recognition — it only 
exists in its purest form, despite 
whether or not it’s loved.

Through adversity, Michigan fights back

Before the last day of the 
meet 
began, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s swimming team gathered 
together as it always has. Team 
meetings weren’t uncommon, 
but after three days of adversity 
and 
underwhelming 
results, 
there was more weight to this 
one.
Instead of sulking in the 
negativity 
that 
came 
easily 
following a 17th-place result 
after 
the 
third 
day, 
the 
Wolverines chose to focus on 
something else — better days. 
The players took turns going 
around and talking about their 
two best moments from the 
year.
“I think everyone realized 
how tough we had practiced,” 
said junior Felix Auböck. “And 
how fast we had gone all year, 
and we can’t be really confident 
in our performance, and we just 
have to let our expectations go 
and focus on the present.”
With clearer minds and down-
to-earth expectations, Michigan 
turned around its performance 
on 
the 
final 
day, 
jumping 
four spots to end the NCAA 
Championships 
in 13th place.
“It 
was 
definitely 
a 
difficult 
race 
since the results 
of the previous 
days didn’t go 
down 
as 
we 
expected,” 
Auböck 
said. 
“So in the last 
day, I think the 
team brought it around really 
well.”
Auböck 
was 
a 
large 
contributor to the Wolverines’ 
change in fortune. Previously, 
the junior missed winning the 
1,650-yard freestyle by seconds. 
He spent the last two years 
finishing as the runner-up each 
time. This year, he looked to 
change that.

His path to first had more 
obstacles than just in the water, 
however. One of the restaurants 
the team had gone to left a bad 
taste in the players’ mouths — 
and stomach. Auböck was one of 
the multiple swimmers affected 
by food poisoning. Despite not 
being in peak condition, he took 
to the water.
“What a great swim by Felix,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mike 
Bottom. “Again, he overcame 
at the beginning 
of the meet, that 
we seemed to run 
into at one of the 
local restaurants, 
but 
he 
came 
through it and 
he won in flying 
colors which is 
pretty amazing.”
Auböck 
finished with a 
time of 14:23.09, 
a second from breaking the 
NCAA record for the 1,650-yard 
freestyle. He did so by playing it 
smart. A lot of the competitors 
in the lanes across from him 
shared similar personal records, 
and so he gameplanned around 
that.
For roughly the first 500 
yards, he wanted to be within 
striking distance relative to 

the other swimmers. After he 
judged his position there, he 
took off, getting inspiration 
from his preliminary runs.
“I knew I had to stay with the 
pack the first third of the race,” 
Auböck said. “And then after, I 
do my own thing.”
Another swimmer to add 
to Michigan’s short list of 
achievements from the weekend 
was Miles Smachlo.
Smachlo 
sat 
out 
for 
six 
months of the season due to 
surgery on his legs. He couldn’t 
even practice until just before 
the Big Ten Championships at 
the beginning of March. With 
less than a month to return to 
form, Smachlo made the most of 
his opportunities.
“Just amazing to see Miles 
getting third (place),” Auböck 
said. “He then gets thrown 
into NCAA, and that was just 
amazing, I think that was a big 
turnaround for us during the 
meet.”
On a day that little went 
right — day three — one of the 
highlights was Smachlo’s 100-
yard butterfly. Finishing third 
with a time of 44.84, he tried to 
rally the Wolverines to not give 
in after a disappointing day.
“Again, he battled, he battled 
back from surgery, he got the 

coolest scars on deck on his 
legs, but he looks mean anyways 
when he stands up,” Bottom said. 
“And that’s an exciting place 
to be and to do it for the team 
when we needed a turnaround 
last night, and if you look at the 
video on the race, how he tried 
to put all the swim back onto 
the team and really encouraged 
them to keep moving forward.”
Juniors 
Charlie 
Swanson 
and 
Tommy 
Cope 
added 
to 
Michigan’s 
stronger 
performance Saturday, placing 
10th and 11th, respectively, in 
the 200-yard breaststroke. Cope 
narrowly missed the cutoff for 
the finals with a time of 1:52.91, a 
mere .01 seconds off qualifying. 
Sophomore 
Richard 
Vargas 
added to the three All-American 
finishes the Wolverines had, 
finishing fourth in the 500-yard 
freestyle with a time of 4:12.21.
“We started not that well at 
all,” Auböck said. “We definitely 
wanted to be somewhere else 
after the first two days, but 
then like this meet is a four-day 
meet so we need to go there and 
give us enough opportunity to 
score. And I think everybody 
took those opportunities those 
last two days and we turned it 
around, and I think we ended 
up with a pretty decent result.”

Johns Hopkins hands Michigan fifth-straight loss

Overcoming 
a 
two-quarter 
scoring drought is hard enough in 
any circumstance. Against one of 
the premier lacrosse programs in 
the NCAA, it’s nearly impossible.
The Michigan men’s lacrosse 
team (3-6 overall, 0-1 Big Ten) 
learned this lesson the hard 
way over the weekend when 
it faced No. 18 Johns Hopkins 
(4-4, 1-0). A 10-0 run by the 
Blue Jays spanning the second 
and third quarters proved too 
much to come back from for the 
Wolverines, who lost by a final 
score of 14-8.
Playing 
against 
his 
alma 
mater and former coach Dave 
Pietramala, 
Michigan 
coach 
Kevin Conry got the Wolverines 
off 
to 
a 
promising 
start. 
Following the Blue Jays’ opening 
faceoff win, it took Michigan 
only a minute and 20 seconds to 
regain possession and find junior 
midfielder 
Avery 
Meyers 
an 
open look. Thirty seconds after 
Meyers rang his shot off the post, 
Decker Curran, who began the 
game only nine points short of 
the 100 mark for his career, put 
the Wolverines in the lead.
Johns Hopkins erased the 
deficit less than a minute later, 
before 
Michigan’s 
fifth-year 
senior defenseman Peter Hollen 
committed his first of two 
penalties on the day. The Blue 
Jays scored almost immediately 
to take the lead. Undisciplined 
play without the ball was a theme 
of the game for the Wolverines, 
as they committed nine penalties 
on the day, four of which led to 
Johns Hopkins goals while on the 
man advantage.
“We’re scrapping, because of 
our deficiencies at the faceoff and 
our injury situation, (because) 
we need possessions,” Conry 
said. “When you give them back 
all of those extra bonuses, you’re 
already at a disadvantage and 
then you’re giving a good, slick 
offense time.”
Coming 
into 
the 
game, 
Michigan 
was 
one 
of 
the 
best teams in the country at 
preventing goals while down a 
player, ranking eighth nationally 
and 
allowing 
opponents 
to 

convert only 21 percent of the 
time.
“You don’t expect to have that 
much laundry thrown,” Conry 
said. “This is the Big Ten, where 
physical lacrosse is supposed to 
be played. I’m surprised by the 
amount of penalties we’ve had 
… But, in Big Ten lacrosse, you 
cannot have that 
many 
mental 
lapses or lapses in 
discipline.”
Despite 
their 
faults, 
the 
Wolverines 
found themselves 
up two goals at 
the end of the 
first 
quarter. 
Curran 
scored 
his second of the 
game with four 
and a half minutes remaining 
and 
sophomore 
attackman 
Kevin Mack dodged left from 
behind the net and scored with 
a defender in his face to build 
the advantage. On the other 
end, strong, physical plays from 
junior defenseman Finn Goonan 
and senior defenseman Nick 
DeCaprio 
ensured 
Michigan 
finished the quarter in the lead.
The 
Wolverines 
clung 
to 
the lead for most of the second 
quarter 
despite 
not 
scoring, 
but Johns Hopkins scored four 
unanswered goals late to take a 

7-5 advantage into the half. The 
Blue Jays were well within reach, 
but six unanswered goals in the 
third quarter, two of which came 
as a result of penalties, ensured 
Michigan 
couldn’t 
mount 
a 
comeback.
One 
of 
the 
defensive 
adjustments 
the 
Wolverines 
made for Johns 
Hopkins 
was 
switching to a 
zone 
defense 
that would force 
more 
outside 
shots. 
The 
coaching 
staff 
believed 
this 
scheme 
played 
better to their 
goaltender’s skill 
set, 
according 
to 
senior 
goaltender Gunner Garn. Garn 
made 15 saves against the Blue 
Jays in his first career start, 
but the plan backfired at times 
when not executed properly by 
Michigan’s defenders.
“It (the zone defense) was a 
silly mistake by us,” Conry said. 
“It was a silly mistake by us. You 
give a good team silly mistakes, 
they take advantage.”
One of the game’s few bright 
spots was the return of senior 
midfielder 
Brent 
Noseworthy 
from injury. Wearing a brace 
on his right knee, Noseworthy 

participated in a limited capacity, 
taking two shots and scoring 
the game’s final goal to keep his 
33-game point streak alive. His 
health status remains day-to-day, 
according to Conry.
Despite displaying admirable 
effort in a role entrusted to 
him only as a result of injuries, 
Goonan finished 6-for-22 on the 
day, taking all but one draw for 
the Wolverines. As Michigan’s 
faceoff woes continue, it will 
be difficult to hinge any hope 
on injured faceoff-men junior 
Matt Dellacroce and sophomore 
Connor Cronin, who have been 
out for the majority of the past 
four games.
“We’ve got what we’ve got,” 
Conry said. “You can’t argue with 
how hard Finn Goonan is playing 
and what he’s given us. The 
numbers don’t reflect, I think, 
the possessions, in terms of the 
amount of times we were able 
to ride the ball back. Between 
Finn, our wings, and our attack 
we’re 
actually 
getting 
extra 
possessions.”
No matter how many extra 
possessions the Wolverines were 
able to generate, though, it wasn’t 
enough. A rash of mental lapses 
on defense and undisciplined 
penalties ultimately made it 
too difficult for Michigan to 
overcome not scoring for the 
game’s middle 30 minutes.

‘M’ takes rivalry match

From the stands, a strong cry 
came out: 
“GO!!!!”
Unanimously, 
Michigan 
faithful responded,
“BLUE!!!!”
Again, the chant rang. 
The packed arena, reduced to 
standing-room-only during the 
doubles matches, erupted into 
applause as the final serve came 
from Ohio State. All eyes were 
on the No. 2 doubles pair Giulia 
Pairone and Anca Craciun as 
they delivered the emphatic 
slam that secured the doubles 
point for Michigan. 
A fight to the finish, the 
duo embraced as they were 
approached by the rest of their 
team.
The 
Michigan 
Varsity 
Tennis Center was raucous, 
resilient and absolutely electric, 
perfectly 
mirroring 
the 
performance of the Wolverines.
Senior Brienne Minor had 
only one word to describe the 
atmosphere:
“Unbelievable.”
The 
Wolverines 
(11-4 overall, 7-0 
Big Ten) defeated 
the 
19th-ranked 
Buckeyes (15-2, 4-1), 
4-1 to extend their 
win streak to six 
matches. 
Along 
with 
the 
exhilarating 
performance 
from 
the 
No. 
2 
pairing, 
Pairone 
and Craciun, the Wolverines 
secured their first point with 
a dominant 6-3 victory from 
senior duo Minor and Kate 
Fahey. 
Nothing 
came 
easy 
for 
Michigan on Sunday. Taking the 
momentum from the doubles 
win and using the cheers from 
the 
crowd, 
the 
Wolverines 
rallied through their singles 
matches to come out victorious. 
“(Ohio 
State 
is) 
fighting, 
too, and competing, and it’s, 
you know, who’s going to be 
toughest and want it a little bit 

more,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “And in the 
pressured moments, I think we 
did a good job today. That’s the 
difference.”
Junior Chiara Lommer put 
Michigan on the brink of a 
match victory behind a 6-4, 7-5 
win. With both sets constantly 
in ties, Lommer eventually 
overpowered 
Ohio 
State’s 
Shiori Fukuda for a statement 
Wolverine point. 
Both Pairone and Minor took 
their first sets by considerable 
margins 
— 
6-4 
and 
6-2, 
respectively — and then came 
back from a 5-2 deficit in their 
second sets to carry them to 
victory. 
As Pairone sent the ball back 
over the net and the Buckeye 
return went straight into it, she 
screamed and celebrated. With 
her win, she gave Michigan the 
final point to seal its victory.
“In tennis, there are always 
ups and downs,” Pairone said. 
“So during the downs, you need 
to stay always positive. I was 
5-2 down in the second set and 
(Michigan assistant head coach) 
Teryn 
(Ashley-
Fitch) 
is 
always 
telling 
me 
‘Stay 
positive and 
keep 
doing 
what you’re 
doing.’ 
I 
was 
doing 
the 
right 
things 
but 
I 
couldn’t 
finish the points, so I kept 
believing in myself and kept 
doing the same things, and in 
the end, it turned out very well.”
Aside from pure skill and 
energetic coaches, who do the 
Wolverines have to credit for 
their victories?
The crowd. 
“I think with a big crowd like 
this, I even told Kate during our 
doubles match, ‘the crowd was 
so electric right now,’ ” Minor 
said. “It’s pumping me up and 
getting me so hyped and that 
gives us positive energy.”

Wolverines finish 10th

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
golf team entered the Bryan 
National 
Collegiate 
this 
weekend determined to change 
the course of its season. With 
just one victory to their name 
this season, the Wolverines 
looked to flip the script at 
the Bryan Park Golf Course 
in Greensboro, N.C. and gain 
momentum in preparation for 
postseason play starting in late 
April.
“We 
were 
feeling 
good 
coming into the event,” said 
Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“Our expectations were to 
shoot the lowest scores we can 
every day and seeing where 
that puts us.”
The 
Bryan 
National 
Collegiate has been notorious 
over its 22-year history for its 
poor weather. This weekend, 
however, 
the 
climate 
and 
course 
conditions 
were 
unusually pleasant, perhaps 
a fateful sign that Michigan 
would rise to the top of the 
leaderboard with the regular 
season winding down.
That was not the case.
On Friday, the Wolverines 
began 
the 
tournament 
by 
shooting 11 shots over par to 
score an overall score of 299, 
placing the team in ninth place 
out of 17 teams after round one. 
Freshman Sophia Trombetta 
led Michigan by posting a 73, 
tying for 16th on the individual 
leaderboard.
The 
Wolverines 
also 
received reinforcement from 
freshman 
Ashley 
Lau 
and 
junior Hannah Ghelfi, who 
both shot at 74.
“(Lau) was consistent all 
week and she gave herself a lot 
of chances to make birdie and 
hit a lot of good putts,” Dowling 
said. “As a freshman, she’s just 
one of most even-keeled and 
mature players I’ve coached.”
During the second round of 

the tournament, Michigan fell 
further down the leaderboard, 
shooting five shots worse than 
it had on Friday. Lau scored 
another 74, yet the Wolverines 
now stood in 11th place after 36 
holes.
Although the team had fallen 
47 strokes behind the leading 
No. 13 Wake Forest entering 
the 
final 
round, 
Michigan 
maintained 
its 
confidence, 
intensity, and will to win.
“Our 
spirits 
were 
good 
because there was a lot of 
confidence that was being 
built,” Dowling said. “And 
there were a lot of good 
stretches from our players and 
we were excited to come into 
today.”
The Wolverines internalized 
that mentality and rebounded 
to score a 298, their best overall 
score of the weekend. Lau 
ended the tournament with 
Michigan’s lowest individual 
score, tying for 21st place. After 
staying in the middle of the 
pack throughout the weekend, 
the 
Wolverines 
ultimately 
settled for 10th place in the 
tournament.
“It’s a big picture goal 
for us to be going into every 
tournament that we play in 
competing to win,” Dowling 
said. “At the same time, we can 
also make strong statements 
whether we’re in 12th place or 
seventh place or sixth place. 
You can always move up the 
leaderboard. There’s always 
an opportunity to move up and 
that matters a lot in golf.”
After 
coming 
away 
emptyhanded 
from 
the 
weekend, 
the 
team 
now 
turns its attention to the 
Lady Buckeye Invitational in 
Columbus and looks to build 
confidence heading into the 
Big Ten Championships.
“We’ve got a lot of good 
ammunition to use, particularly 
from this week,” Dowling said. 
“Continuing 
to 
get 
better, 
that’s our expectation.”

From backup to cleanup hitter, 
Sobczak finds her stride at first

When the Michigan softball 
team opened its season in Tampa, 
Fla., Alex Sobczak’s name wasn’t 
on the starting lineup card.
Instead, 
the 
senior 
utility 
player lost a competition for 
the Wolverines’ everyday first 
baseman 
role 
to 
sophomore 
infielder Taylor Bump back in 
February.
Sobczak saw limited action 
as a pinch hitter throughout the 
opening weekend, but Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins ultimately 
kept her out of the starting lineup 
until the team’s fourth game.
For the first two weeks of the 
season, the first baseman job was 
a race between two players who 
didn’t have much experience on 
the right side of the infield. In 
Sobczak’s case, her 63 previous 
starts had primarily come at 
catcher and third base.
When Hutchins first proposed 
the idea of shifting her to first base 
in the preseason, 
Sobczak 
embraced 
the 
challenge.
“When 
I 
first 
got 
an 
opportunity 
to play at first 
(base), I just felt 
like I wanted to 
give more to the 
team,” 
Sobczak 
said. “At times, I 
haven’t had that same outlook of 
being a badass, so to speak, and 
really owning it.
“It’s really fun to get to play 
different positions in college. I’ve 
really enjoyed it, but (first base) 
is definitely very different. It’s a 
different role. As a third baseman, 
I remember having to be super 
aggressive with everything, but 
first base is more about being there 
for your teammates and making 
sure you pick them up and you’re 
ready for them.”

It wasn’t until the third week of 
the season when Sobczak began 
to establish the upper hand over 
Bump. During the week of Feb. 22, 
Sobczak won the job for good with 
a pair of singles against then-No. 9 
Louisiana State and Memphis.
When 
Sobczak 
took 
over 
permanently, her batting average 
sat at a lackluster .125. Today, her 
.385 clip is the 11th-best in the 
Big Ten. She’s been locked in at 
the plate during 
the 
Wolverines’ 
current 
11-game 
win 
streak, 
racking 
up 
15 
hits in 29 at-bats 
during 
this 
stretch — good for 
a batting average 
of .517. And that’s 
no small sample 
size, considering 
she has a total of 
65 at-bats on the season.
In Michigan’s series sweep of 
Rutgers last weekend, Sobczak 
racked up six hits in nine at-bats, 
including three home runs, nine 
RBI and five runs scored. On 
Monday, she was named Big Ten 
Player of the Week for her efforts. 
She is the second Wolverine to 
earn the honor this season, joining 
freshman left fielder Lexie Blair.
As Michigan enters the heart of 
its conference schedule, Sobczak’s 
.708 slugging percentage and .535 

on-base percentage are both team-
highs. Her 1.243 OPS is the highest 
the program has seen since Sierra 
Romero notched a 1.460 OPS en 
route to National Player of the 
Year honors in 2016.
To Sobczak, it’s just her way of 
contributing.
“I definitely don’t have the 
speed that Lexie (Blair) does, so 
I have to find a different role,” 
Sobczak joked. “Being cleanup 
hitter, it’s awesome being able to 
score your teammates, and I think 
that’s one of the best feelings.”
Hutchins knew Sobczak would 
produce at the plate, but she didn’t 
expect her defense to emerge as 
a strong suit. For the Wolverines, 
Sobczak’s stellar .992 fielding 
percentage is the cherry on top of 
the sundae.
“She’s gotten it done for us (on 
defense),” Hutchins said. “She’s 
out there because of her bat, but 
she gets it done. She’s certainly 
helped her infield out when they 
haven’t made good throws. … She’s 
playing hard for her team and she’s 
having fun.”
After spending most of the 
opening weekend in the dugout, 
Sobczak is now a staple in the 
heart of Michigan’s batting order 
and one of its most reliable fielders.
At this point, the possibility 
of a starting lineup card without 
her name penciled in seems 
preposterous.

Pitching, defense key to ‘M’ success

Consistency is key. But in its 
absence, balance can prove just as 
important.
Despite its ability to dominate, 
the Michigan baseball team’s 
offense 
has 
struggled 
with 
consistency — evident in last 
season’s 
early 
end 
after 
a 
promising 20-game win streak, as 
well as its sporadic performances 
against mid-major opponents this 
year. In light of this, Michigan’s 
pitching and defense have been 
essential in holding opponents 
to few runs and securing wins 
even when the offense can’t pull 
through. 
With 
big-name 
matchups 
coming up against offensively-
strong 
Minnesota 
and 
Ohio 
State over the next two weeks, 
this dynamic could prove quite 
helpful.
The defense’s utility was on 
display in last Wednesday’s low-
scoring doubleheader wins (1-0 
and 2-0) against San Jose State. 
While the offense couldn’t always 
produce, solid performances such 
as sophomore left-hander Angelo 
Smith’s pitching during the second 
game and the quick fielding 
that forced several 1-2-3 innings 

during the first game ensured that 
the Spartans never capitalized on 
Michigan’s difficulty at the plate.
Over the weekend against 
Michigan 
State, 
the 
defense 
even balanced itself out as the 
Wolverines’ 
fielding 
strengths 
bailed out some difficulties in 
pitching. When junior right-
hander 
Karl 
Kauffman 
and 
freshman 
left-hand 
reliever 
Walker 
Cleveland, 
frustrated 
by the persistent rain, allowed 
several runs and walks, clutch 
fielding — such as Jordan Brewer’s 
double play in the second inning 
that stifled the Spartans’ scoring 
opportunity 
— 
ensured 
the 
margin never narrowed beyond 
comfort.
Indeed, even with efforts to 
create a more balanced squad, 
Michigan fundamentally remains 
a defensive team. 
“We’re built on pitching and 
defense,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “We’ve had good 
defense when we needed to and 
when we didn’t have much going 
on offensively.” 
With so much reliance on 
defense, it can get ugly when 
things don’t go the Wolverines’ 
way — especially against strong 
opponents. A disappointing sweep 
at the hands of No. 17 Texas 

Tech two weekends ago saw 
the Wolverines stuck in the low 
singles in terms of runs while the 
Red Raiders scored many more 
and capitalized on numerous 
errors. 
“We couldn’t hold (Texas Tech) 
down with our bullpen,” Bakich 
said after the difficult series last 
month. “They hit against us like 
they knew every pitch that was 
coming.
“… What stood out is that we 
were right there with them for 
about half of each game. But they 
were able to separate thanks to 
some costly mistakes of ours.”
When the team’s offensive and 
defensive 
strengths 
combine, 
the Wolverines can be dominant: 
They scored 23 runs against 
Manhattan, 12 over Western 
Michigan and 16 runs against 
Michigan State over the weekend. 
Of course, a strong offense is 
equally as, if not more, important 
on the diamond than defense. But 
they do complement one another, 
and Michigan stands to benefit 
from continued investment in a 
clutch defense that can step in 
and save the day against tough 
opponents.
Minnesota and Ohio State will 
be far more formidable if they 
don’t.

Michigan ventures into new waters

BELLEVILLE — Faster. Faster.
It was the last 500 meters of the 
1V8 race, and the No. 9 Michigan 
rowing team found its first varsity 
eight boat trailing behind No. 5 
Yale’s. But what was once a four-
seat gap had narrowed to just 
inches.
Faster. Faster.
Sophomore 
Charlotte 
Powers urged freshman Jessica 
Schoonbee to increase the pace. 
As the rhythm setter, it was up to 
Schoonbee to execute the orders 
of her coxswain and lead the 
pace for the Wolverines. Before, 
Michigan’s attempts to close the 
distance had been unsuccessful, 
as the Bulldogs simply fended off 
the pushes each time.
But in the last stretch of the 
race, the gap drew smaller and 
smaller as the Wolverines’ stroke 
rate grew faster and faster.
Faster. Stop.
The sprint to the finish created 
a photo finish. Taking a chance, 
the Wolverines ventured into new 
waters, and the gamble paid off. 
They finished the race in 6:35.32, a 
mere .77 seconds faster than Yale.
The game plan for Michigan 
was to stay composed and stay 
true to itself, the first 1,500. Don’t 
let the other team’s boat affect 
you, and don’t let up. And if that 
holds up, see where the other 

boat is and respond accordingly. 
Only, when the Wolverines looked 
over to Yale’s line at the last 500 
meters, they knew they needed 
more than just composure to win.
Sprinting is not something 
they practice often — Saturday 
was the first day they did so all 
year. So before the race, the 1V8 
got the approval from Michigan 
coach Mark Rothstein to use one 
solid, decisive move — sprinting. 
And after rowing from behind 
since the start, the boat decided 
to implement the newly acquired 
move. The Wolverines closed out 
the race, rowing at 42 strokes per 
minute.
“I mean, we were down the 
whole race,” Powers said. “And 
we as a boat, at the 500, decided 
we were just going to stop them 
from moving up any more and 
hold then we kind of just inched 
into them.”
All aspects of the boat executed 
in the clutch. The pressure came 
from the Bulldogs, but Michigan 
didn’t bite, instead, heeding the 
advice from Powers and following 
through.
“We did a great job executing 
today,” 
said 
senior 
Kathryn 
Grotto. “But I think continuing to 
stay internal and not focusing on 
what other boats are doing and 
just rowing our own race to make 
sure that we’re putting ourselves 
in the best position to finish the 
piece.

“And our stroke (Schoonbee) 
is a freshman. It was her first 
weekend. Absolutely killed it. 
Every time a coxswain would say 
something, she just executed. And 
she did it, and she took the rate 
up.”
Schoonbee, in her weekend 
debut, highlighted a unified effort 
to set an aggressive pace for the 
Wolverines. Following suit, the 
rest of the varsity boats succeeded 
to win their respective races.
The 2V8, contrary to the 
first varsity eight, took an early 
lead from the start. Starts were 
something the team had been 
practicing in the past week. 
It paid dividends when Yale 
proceeded to bite into the four-
seat 
lead. 
However, 
toward 
the last stretch of the race, the 
Bulldogs relinquished pressure 
and Michigan won with an open-
water lead, tallying 6:57.22.
The 1V4 and 2V4 boats finished 
equally as dominant, recording a 
7:50.29 and 8:01.86, respectively. 
Both created open-water leads 
that they didn’t give up, similarly 
to the second varsity eight boat.
The 
weekend 
sweep 
was 
denied, however, by the novice 
boats who failed to close the race, 
finishing 7:28.93 to Yale’s 7:25.50.
Despite the failures of the 
novice boats, Michigan will chalk 
up the weekend as a success, 
nearly sweeping both days of the 
regatta.
