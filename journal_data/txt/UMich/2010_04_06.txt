public health
benefits of reform
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
United States Sen. Debbie
Stabenow (D-Mich.) discussed
health care reform legislation and

its impact on the public health
community yesterday during a
talk with members of the School
of Public Health.
As a member of the Senate
Finance Committee, Stabenow
has been involved in the debate
over the health care reform bill
that President Barack Obama
signed into law on March 23.
Speaking to a packed audito-
rium, Stabenow provided a time-
line of health care changes that
will take effect over the next eight

months. Many of these changes
will directly impact members of
the University community, she
said. Throughout the talk, Stabe-
now emphasized that health care
affordability was the driving force
behind the legislation.
"The bottom line is this is about
making a commitment in this
country ... and finding a way for
people to get health insurance,"
Stabenow said.
AccordingtoStabenow, some of
the changes to take effect imme-

diately include tax cuts for small
businesses with fewer than 25
employees to help them provide
health care benefits and increased
investment in community health
centers in more than 10,000 com-
munities.
The bill also provides access
to a special fund, which will be
available starting at the end of
June, for patients with pre-exist-
ing conditions to pay for medical
expenses. The fund will remain

Michigan-Flint, spoke about the
campus's current state of affairs
and its future plans for increasing
the University's role in the Flint
community.
Person - a University alum
who has worked in her current
position for just over a year - told
SACUA - the University's lead-
ing faculty governing body, --that
she was originally drawn to work-
ing at the University's Flint cam-
pus because of the challenge that
would come with working in a

"It was really about the chal-

let's see if we collectively - we

By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
With commencement only four
weeks away, some soon-to-be
graduates are struggling to find
jobs with the effects of the eco-
nomic downturn still lingering.

Lynne Sebille-White, assistant
director of the University's Career
Center, said though the job market
is starting to show signs of recov-
ery, students are still goingto have
a difficult time finding jobs.
"I would say that maybe it's a
little better than last year, but it's
certainly not booming," Sebille-
White said.
According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, while every
state experienced an increase in
the unemployment rate last year,
Michigan experienced the highest
increase in its unemployment rate.

And experts report that though
the job layoff rate today is about
the same as it was during past eco-
nomic downturns, the net job loss
is greater because the hiring rate
is lower.
The "brain drain" of students
who attend college in Michigan
and then leave the state has been
cited as a contributor to Michi-
gan's struggling economy. Accord-

Slowing down in the classroom

Though most students find that
keeping up with all their classes
can make for a hectic schedule, for
Graham Griffith, Howard R. Marsh
visiting professor of journalism, the
academic grind has allowed him
somewhat of a break from his other
fast-paced job.
Coming from a career as a public
radio producer, Griffith said because
he's hardwired to think in a daily
news cycle, teaching has been "a
remarkable challenge and a great
experience."
Bringing his professional expe-
rience to the classroom, Griffith is
teaching a communication studies
seminar this semester that examines
how journalists operate effectively
in times of crisis and how to take
advantage of the inevitable shift of
news to a digital platform.
Griffith said he got his first taste
for academia when he took part in
the Knight Wallace Fellowship pro-

gram at the University during the
2005-2006 academic year. The pro-
gram brings professional journalists
to the University for a year to focus
on a topic of their choice.
"That was a big wake-up call for
me," he said.
After completing the fellowship,
Griffith began working on his lat-
est project, a National Public Radio
program and online site called The
Takeaway. But when he needed a
break, he decided to apply for a job at
the University.
Very much a New Englander,
Griffith was born in New Haven,
Conn. and grew up around Wooster,
Mass. He graduated from Wesleyan
University in Connecticut, where he
played DivisiontI football and over-
saw the student-run radio station.
Griffith went on to become the
Executive Producer of Radio Pro-
grams at NPR, working in Washing-
ton, New York and Kosovo.

Though Ann Arbor is a differ-
ent environment from where he
grew up, moving is nothing new to
Griffith.
"Life is more interesting if you're
able to explore new places," he said.
He said the hardest thing for him
to get used to is Ann Arbor's lack of
good barbecue. A certified barbecue
judge, Griffith says what he misses
most is "real'cue."
Still, Griffith says thatfor him, life
is about embracing different types of,
communities, adding that he most s?
enjoys working in the Midwest,
because it has experience dealing
with economic struggles.
Though he's enjoying his time in /
Ann Arbor, Griffith will be traveling
to Helsinki, Finland this summer to
learn about its media system with_
his wife, a public historian studying
there as part of the Fulbright Fel- AN5A SCHULTE/Daily
lowship. Professor Graham Griffith uses his routine trick of post-its
-ALEX LANE as a tool for visualizing the flow of his class schedule.

NEWS BRIEFS
HONOLULU
Former B-2 bomber
to face federal trial
for selling secrets
A former B-2 stealth bomber
engineer from Maui who is accused
of selling military secrets to China
is due to face trial in federal court
this week.
Noshir Gowadia (NOH'-sheer
GO'-wah-dee-a) faces 21 counts
including conspiracy, violating the
arms export control act and money
laundering.
The trial comes some 4 years
after the 66-year-old's arrest. It
was originally scheduled to start
in 2006, but the need for lawyers
to obtain classified clearances and
other issues repeatedly pushed
back the date.
Gowadia has been in federal
detention since his October 2005
arrest because a judge ruled he is a
flight risk.
Jury selection is scheduled to
begin today at U.S. District Court in
Honolulu, and opening statements
are expected tomorrow. The trial is
expected to last atleast two months.

Scientists do not know if the
earthquakes will result in the vol-

active for months, at times produc-
ing huge ash plumes and sending
mud flows down its flanks.
RickWessels,ageophysicistwith
the U.S. Geological Survey, says the
Mount Redoubt earthquakes are
not connected to Sunday's 7.2-mag-

France's Renault and Japan's
Nissan, which already have a

ing engines and small-car plat-
forms for Daimler's Smart car
and Renault's Twingo. They also
would collaborate on the research

WASHINGTON
Obamas welcome
thousands to WH
Easter Egg Roll
The Obama family welcomed
thousands of children to the sun-
soaked South Lawn of the White
House yesterday for the annual
Easter Egg Roll, an essential rite of
spring.
The Egg Roll dates back to 1878,
when President Rutherford B.
Hayes was in office. In the main
event, children race to push eggs
through the grass using wooden
spoons.
"Is everybody having a good
time?" Obama asked the enthusi-
astic crowd from a balcony over the
south lawn. "Happy Easter every-
body. We are thrilled that all of you
could come."
The theme of this year's egg roll
is "Ready, Set, Go!" and that ties in
with first lady Michelle Obama's
campaign against childhood obe-
sity. The event features basket-
ball, yoga, dancing, gardening and
healthy eating activities.
"Today we have transformed the
South Lawn into a playground,"
Mrs. Obama said. "And our hope
today is that in addition to having
fun and doing some of the tradi-
tional activities like the egg roll
and the Easter egg hunt, that you
can learn about beginning to live a
more healthy life."

Cuban gov't
releases Elian
Gonzalez photos

President Barack Obama discusses the START arms reduction treaty, during a phone call with Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev on Friday in the Oval Officeof the White House in Washington.
U-S to begin talks of a
stricter nuclear polic

Photos show former
exile, now 16 years
old, attending
Communist meeting
HAVANA (AP) - Cuba has
released photos of one-time exile
cause celebre Elian Gonzalez
wearing an olive-green military
school uniform and attending a
Young Communist Union con-
gress.
Gonzalez, now 16 with close-
ly cropped black hair, is shown
serious-faced with fellow youth
delegates during last weekend's
congress at a sprawling and drab
convention center in western
Havana. The images were posted
yesterday on Cuban government
Web sites, then widely picked up
by electronic, state-controlled
media.
When he was 5, Elian was
found floating off the coast of
Florida in an inner tube after his
mother and others fleeing Cuba
drowned trying to reach the U.S.

Elian's father, who was separated
from his mother, had remained in
Cuba.
U.S. immigration officials ruled
the boy should return to Cuba
over the objections of his Miami
relatives and other Cuban exiles,
creating a national furor that
caused even presidential candi-
dates George W. Bush and Al Gore
to weigh in on the matter.
His relatives refused to give
him up. Federal agents raided the
Little Havana home of his uncle
with guns drawn 10 years ago this
month and seized the boy from a
closet to return him to his father.
Elian was celebrated as a hero
in Cuba upon his return and his
father, restaurant employee Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, was elected
to parliament - a seat he retains
today.
Cuba usually marks Gonza-
lez's birthday every Dec. 7 with
parades and other local events,
but such activities are not open to
foreign reporters.
Gonzalez formally joined the
Young Communist Union in 2008,
making headlines across Cuba.

to urge Russia to return could persuade Russia to negoti-

ons - a category of arms in which
the Russians hold a large numeri-
cal advantage.
But the call for expanded talks
is also linked to a nearer-term
goal: constraining the spread of
nuclear weapons technology and
keeping nuclear weapons out of
the hands of terrorists.
Reducing the short range
bombs and stored warheads
would involve more intrusive
inspections than agreed in the
treaty Obama and Medvedev will
sign this week. But officials say
that new technologies for verify-
ing and counting warheads could
ease concerns on both sides about
protecting the secrecy of their
weapons designs.
These technologies allow
inspectors to verify narrow char-
acteristics of warheads without
revealing details of their struc-
ture.
Another potential obstacle to
expanding the next set of nucle-
ar arms talks is Russia's strong
resistance to U.S. missile defense
in Europe.
Moscow sought to include con-
straints on missile defense in the
new START, but U.S. officials say
the agreement contains no such
limits. The treaty text has not
been made public.
Overall, when it comes to fur-
ther cuts in nuclear arsenals, the
Obama administration could face
an uphill struggle in any effort to
bring Russia back to the bargain-
ing table.
"The Russians seem less than
enthusiastic about moving ahead
with this," said Joseph Cirin-
cione, president of the Plough-
shares Fund, a foundation that
advocates for a nuclear weapon-
free world.

retary of state for arms control,
told reporters March 29 that the
administration has a "big agen-
da" for the next set of nuclear
arms talks, and that it includes
limiting short-range weapons.
The U.S. has an estimated 200
short-range nuclear weapons in
Europe under a NATO agreement,
whereas the Russians are believed
to have 10 times that many
deployed in European Russia.

Judge sides with AP,
will require further
evidence from Fairey

Documents related
to disputed Obama
'HOPE' image to be
disclosed
NEW YORK (AP) - Lawyers
for artist Shepard Fairey must
disclose the identities of anyone
who deleted or destroyed records
related to a copyright dispute
over the Barack Obama "HOPE"
image, a judge said yesterday.
U.S. District Judge Alvin K.
Hellerstein ruled in favor of The
Associated Press in most of its
requests for evidence, including
when Fairey's lawyers first knew
the AP had asserted that it holds
the copyright to a photograph the
image was based on.
He said lawyers must dis-
close relevant documents that
were deleted or destroyed from
Fairey's files and when the dele-
tions or destruction occurred.
Hellerstein further said the
lawyers must disclose the iden-

tities of anyone who tampered
with or destroyed records, com-
manded and supervised the acts
or was told about them.
An attorney for Fairey did not
immediately respond to a request
for comment on the ruling.
Dale Cendali, a lawyer for
the AP, said the news organiza-
tion was "very pleased" with the
order.
"The discovery in this case
has been unnecessarily burden-
some for The Associated Press
as a result of Fairey's discovery
abuses," she said. "We're very
pleased that the court is requir-
ing Shepard Fairey and his com-
panies to comply promptly with
their discovery obligations."
Fairey sued the AP last year,
asking a judge to rule that his
artwork does not infringe copy-
rights held by the AP. The AP
countersued a month later, saying
the uncredited, uncompensated
use of one of the news coopera-
tive's pictures violated copyright
laws and posed a threat to jour-
nalism.

Gender-neutral safety
New IFC party rules spread burden of responsibility
orority members will soon be joining their neon-T-shirted
brothers as monitors at fraternity parties. The Interfrater-
nity Council, the governing body of most campus fraterni-
ties, recently passed a bylaw amendment to mandate sober sorority
members in addition to fraternity sober monitors at Greek parties.
The IFC and the Panhellenic Council, the IFC's sorority counter-
part, believe participation will be mutually beneficial. The new reg-
ulation is only a minor adjustment, but it demonstrates the Greek
leadership's genuine desire to increase safety at parties. The Greek
community should continue to implement changes that encourage
students' security. And the University should join in this culture of
safety instead of ignoring the realities of underage drinking.

I was a little disappointed with
the pitch. It was high and outside.

Coleman's smoking gun

Last week, the IFC passed an amend-
ment to its bylaws that will require each
sorority attending a fraternity-sponsored
social event to provide two sober liai-
sons. The regulation sought to extend the
responsibility of monitoring parties to
sororities on campus. The Greek commu-
nity claims that the regulation is neces-
sary to protect party-goers by increasing
the number of sober individuals at a party
and spreading the responsibility among
more people. IFC and Panhellenic leaders
believe the sororities will comply, since
female guests may feel more comfortable
asking a fellow female for help.
Though the title is different, sorority
liaisons would essentially fill the same role
as sober monitors. And their presence will
make parties safer. More sober individu-
als at parties will increase the likelihood of
identifying and dealing with the concerns
that can arise when alcohol is involved. And
many female party-goers may feel more
comfortable asking a female for help than
a male. A more diverse group of sober indi-
viduals will also be capable of handling a
wider variety of problems that may arise.
The amendment illustrates a changing
mentality in Greek communities nation-
wide. Sororities currently aren't allowed to
hold parties because of antiquated gender-
role conceptions. Due to this provision, fra-
ternities have had to bear the entire burden
of throwing and supervising parties alone.

The update to the IFC bylaws reflects mod-
ern gender roles and distributes responsi-
bility more equally among members of the
Greek community.
It also changes the traditional approach
to the binge drinking that often takes place
at campus parties, which has been to ignore,
overlook or deny. This has often been the
attitude of both the University adminis-
tration and the IFC in the past. University
President Mary Sue Coleman has stalled
progress on combating the dangers of binge
drinking by refusing to sign the Amethyst
Initiative, which calls for discussion of the
current drinking age and asks if it is the most
effective way to encourage safe drinking
practices. Coleman's actions haven't helped
to deal with binge drinking on campus.
But the Greek system is stepping up. With
the new regulation, the IFC and Panhel-
lenic Council are acknowledging the some-
times dangerous elements of Greek parties
and are trying to do something to combat
it. While the presence of liaisons is only a
small improvement, it indicates that the
culture of turning a blind eye to the reality
that students drink is ending.
Coleman and the University administra-
tion should follow the IFC's lead on this
issue. It's important to recognize problems
so that steps can be taken to resolve them.
The new regulation is beneficial for the
Greek community, and it should continue to
increase its efforts to keep parties safe.

The policy was made by the
president. No one knows how
this decision was made." This
was the comically
honest response of
Ken Warner, dean
of the School of
Public Health, to
the question of who
proposed the cam-
pus-wide smok-
ing ban, according
to The MichiganY
Daily. ROBERT
It's clear, then, SOAVE
that University
President Mary
Sue Coleman is the
architect of the Smoke-Free Initiative,
which will take effect in July of 2011.
The initiative will prohibit smoking on
all outdoor University property. Cole-
man and University administrators
have been embarrassingly vague about
why such a ban is necessary. Instead,
they keep insisting that the smoking
ban will improve public health.
Interestingly enough, the smok-
ing ban may also improve Coleman's
salary.
That's because Coleman isn't just a
college president. In her spare time,
she moonlights as a businesswoman,
sitting on the board of directors for
major pharmaceutical company John-
son & Johnson, as well as the Meredith
Corporation, a magazine publisher.
According to Forbes.com, her position
at Johnson & Johnson netted her an
income of $229,000 last year.
Among Johnson & Johnson's many
marketed brands are smoking ces-
sation products like Nicorette and
Nicoderm - products that University
smokers will feel encouraged to use
once smoking becomes unwelcome on
campus in July 2011. Indeed, adminis-
trators have already announced that
smoking cessation products may be
offered at discounted prices to stu-
dents who are trying to quit.

obviously, this is a sizeable con-
flict of interest for Coleman. Even if
her Johnson & Johnson salary didn't
actively influence her decision to ban
smoking, it makes it substantially
harder to take her at her word that the
University needs this ban - especially
when representatives of her adminis-
tration can't come up with a specific
reason for it.
But Coleman's corporate troubles
run deeper than this. As the Univer-
sity's College Libertarians pointed
out in a press release this weekend,
Johnson & Johnson has an affiliated
non-profit group, the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, which lobbies
for the adoption of certain health-
related policies through research and
grant money. RWJF is notoriously
anti-smoking, as its website explains:
"At the state and community level, we
support advocacy for proven tobacco
control measures, such as smoke-free
air laws, funding of prevention and
cessation programs and increases in
tobacco taxes."
While it's no surprise that RWJF
would fight for laws that restrict
smoking and lead to increased use of
Johnson & Johnson products, such
an aggressive lobbying force should
not hold financial sway over the pres-
ident of a public university. Students,
faculty and staff must be able to trust
that their president is working in the
best interests of the University corn-
munity, not a profit-motivated cor-
poration. Even the perception of a
conflict of interest is embarrassing
for this institution.
Seen in this light, some of Coleman's
other policy positions make more
sense, too. She has adamantly refused
to sign the Amethyst Initiative, a peti-
tion asking Congress to take up the
issue of whether the current drinking
age should be lowered in accordance
with mounting evidence in favor of
such a change. Though 135 college
presidents have signed the initiative,

Coleman won't - a baffling position,
since the initiative only calls for a dis-
cussion, not a change. As the presi-
dent of a research university, Coleman
can't actually believe that the current
drinking age is a matter that shouldn't
even be debated.
'U' president
has questionable
corporate relations.

I
I

But in addition to its anti-smoking
policies, RWJF has been accused by
the Center for Consumer Freedom of
holding attitudes toward alcohol con-
sumption that are borderline prohi-
bitionist. Among its policy positions,
RWJF intransigently supports keep-
ing the drinking age at 21. Coleman's
seemingly baseless opposition to the
Amethyst Initiative makes a lot more
sense if it's.because she has corporate
overlords at J & J breathing down her
neck.
Coleman's situation, then, is a fun-
damental betrayal of the values of
a public university - whether she's
being influenced or not. She should
demonstrate that her true commit-
ment is to the integrity of the Univer-
sity and resign her corporate positions,
donate her salaries or, at the very least,
reverse the upcoming smoking ban.
And when Ladies' Home Journal
- published by the Meredith Corpo-
ration, which paid Coleman $137,000
last year - becomes required reading
in English 125 classes, that's when
we'll really know Coleman's corporate
ties are influencing her.

Fund Teach for America

Nationwide and here at University, mem-
bers of the class of 2010 applied to Teach for
America in record numbers - more than
46,000 applicants for this fall's class of 4,350
teacher corps members. Here at Michigan, 461
seniors applied - a remarkable 7.4 percent of
the senior class. This continues the strong rela-
tionship between TFA and the University. For
the last four years, the University has been the
top contributor to TFA.
But in spite of all of this interest, Teach for
America is facing a funding crisis.
Under a new proposal currently before Con-
gress, TFA's federal funding for 2011-2012 would
be eliminated. This is a deeply troubling proposal
that would dim admissions prospects for Univer-
sity seniors and derail the organization's long-
term goal of ending educational inequality.
Due to its strong track record of providing
quality teachers and leaders, TFA has received
federal funding for years. This year, TFA
requested $50 million from Congress to meet
increasing demand among college students
and communities.
Without federal funding, TFA would be
unable to hire the more than 1,350 teachers
who would teach 86,000 students in the com-
ing school year. This scenario severely limits
opportunities for recent graduates at the Uni-
versity and other schools to make a difference
in our public schools.
The proposed federal funding cuts come
at a critical time for TFA's expansion. For the
last several months, TFA representatives have
been meeting with Detroit's top leaders and
charter schools in hopes of bringing at least
50 corps members to Detroit schools by next
fall. Without secure federal funding, TFA faces
yet another hurdle in this planned expansion
into Detroit. It would be disheartening to see
another year go by without TFA corps mem-
bers in Detroit, further delaying the opportu-

nity for University students to give back to the
state of Michigan.
The need for TFA corps members in Detroit
could not be more real. The average ACT score
for a student in Detroit Public Schools is a 16,
with a graduation rate under 50 percent. This
reality is not confined to Detroit. Nationally,
more than 14 million children living in low-
income communities are performing below
grade level on standardized tests, and are
falling further behind their more affluent
peers each year. 50 percent of students in low-
income communities will not graduate from
high school by the time they are 18 years old.
Those who do graduate on time perform, on
average, at an eighth-grade level. We need pro-
grams like TFA to increase educational oppor-
tunity in our public schools.
With an annual $50 million appropriation
from Congress, TFA would be able to double in
size over the next five years. At this scale, the
organization would be able to provide nearly
17,000 corps member positions each year and
reach more than one million underserved stu-
dents in nearly all 50 states. And by 2016, TFA
will have more than 50,000 alumni who will
create a powerful leadership force for mean-
ingful and bold education reform.
As college students, we can make our voices
heard to Congress on today's most urgent civil
rights issue: education. As students at the Uni-
versity we have so much at stake. A smaller TFA
corps will mean fewer jobs for University gradu-
ates, and school districts just 30 minutes away
will continue to struggle to succeed in the face
of the achievement gap. I hope you'll join me in a
grassroots campaign to call and write U.S. Sena-
tors Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow to urge
them to support federal funding for TFA.

Why I Relay

Relay For Life is a 24-hour event benefiting the Ameri-
can Cancer Society. Michigan community members join
together in the fight against cancer in the hopes that one
day cancer will be eliminated. Last year, Relay For Life
had over 5,000 participants here at the University. We
raised over $305,000 in 2009 and have been nationally
recognized as one of the top five collegiate fundraising
events.
At Relay For Life, we celebrate cancer survivors. A
cancer survivor is anyone living with a history of cancer,
from the moment of diagnosis through the remainder of
life. Anyone who has lived one day with cancer is a survi-
vor. Survivors are encouraged to attend our event to help
us celebrate all the successes we have accomplished.
At the University we take great pride in our superb fac-
ulty, staff, administration and community, and as such we
are encouraging you to join the Michigan community in
the fight against cancer. Most people have been affected
by cancer at some point in their lives. Relay For Life serves
as a means to celebrate the successes we have had in the
arenas of cancer research and patient support, remember
those who have lost their lives in the battle against can-
cer, and to fight back.
I participate in the Relay to find a cure so that others
don'thave to deal with the pain of cancer. My grandmoth-
er was diagnosed with cancer before I was born, but she
survived and I never knew what she really went through.
But the summer before my freshman year of college, the
cancer resurfaced. She considered not going through with
surgery because of the pain it had caused her earlier in

life. This was devastating to me. What would I do without
my grandma? She ended up getting-the surgery and was
told that it gave her another 20 years of life, which I am
so grateful for. But it was very hard for me to move away
to school while she was recovering. I couldn't believe that
my grandma had almost been taken away from me. The
pain and sadness I felt was awful and I wish no one would
ever have to feel such emotions because of cancer.
Join me and over 2,800 participants at Relay For Life at
Palmer Field, from 10 a.m. on Apr. 10 to 10 a.m. on Apr.11.
The day oftRelay includes a lot of food, games, entertain-
ment, sports and, most importantly, being a part of Michi-
gan's fight against cancer. All money raised goes directly
to the American Cancer Society to help fund research
efforts and programs to support cancer patients and their
families. As an amazing research institute, the University
receives a number of grants each year sponsored by the
American Cancer Society for cancer research.
Starting a team is extremely easy - you can sign up
today at www.mrelay.org. Between now and Relay, team
members must register and then begin to fundraise. This
is a great way to encourage and promote unity throughout
all departments, schools and colleges, as well as support
University students while helping out a great cause. If you
have any questions, please feel free to e-mail mrelayl0@
umich.edu.
Join Michigan in uniting for a common cause in the
hopes that cancer will one day be eliminated.

A beautiful nightmare

Lucille's balls

Oscar nominee for Best
Foreign Film gives a haunting
look at pre-Nazi Germany
By NICK COSTON
DailyArts Writer
The German Expressionism style of film-
making reached its peak during World War
I. The two most famous examples of the era
were Robert Wiene's "The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and
Fritz Lang's "Metropolis." All ****E
German Expressionist films
have two things in common: The White
they take place in worlds that Ribbon
defy logic, realism, light and
even physics. And, according At the
to film theorist Sigfried Kra- Michigan
cauer, they foretell the rise of Sony Pictures
Nazi Germany. Classics
Unlike the impossible
geometry of the world in
"Caligari," Michael Haneke's "The White Rib-
bon," last year's winner of the Palme d'Or at the
Cannes Film Festival, is set against a landscape
that could have very well existed in the Weimar
Republic; in fact, it's idyllic. It's a lovely little
village where trees sway gently in the spring
and roads are caked in pure white snow in the
winter. It's the people who live there who are
the Expressionist nightmares.
Because here in Eichwald, everyone is a mon-
ster. Fathers beat their children, sometimes in
the name of discipline, sometimes as a gross
exercise of power. Husbands beat their wives,
sometimes out of anger, sometimes out of bore-
dom. And the wickedness of the village is only
escalating. The only adult with a discernible
moral compass is our narrator and guide, the
wimpy schoolteacher (newcomer Christian
Friedel), a man helpless, if not useless, in his
investigation of the village's recent atrocities
committed by an unknown malevolence.
Children are a mercurial force in storytell-

"Quit looking at my broach."
ing. When they are harmed, their attacker is
automatically vilified. When they are the iniq-
uitous ones, they are more dangerous than any
adult they encounter. Above all, when their
performances exceed those of their grown-up
costars, they can haunt the audience in a way
that an older actor never could.
"The White Ribbon" employs its children
in all three forms. While the film's adults are
impenetrable masks of cruelty save the young
teacher, its kids are multidimensional. They
accept their corporal puniwshments with
clasped fingers and pious smiles. Their faces
morph from filial sorrow to vindictive rage in
a blink. They express a strange and pressing
desire to visit the oft-injured townsfolk.
Scariest of all is to know what these children
will become. We see them in their larval stage,
before they wield any influence and exert it in
horrific ways. Their parents are the devils for
now, but history will demonstrate soon enough
that the little ones learn from Mom and Dad
and devolve through yet newer and crueler
methods. Plenty of films have featured Nazis;
only Haneke dares to examine how they were
made.

A film such as this, fueled by hatred, has
to reflect that vitriol in its camera's frame.
Images are stark, barren; movement is scarce.
"The White Ribbon" was nominated for Best
Cinematography in addition to its Foreign
Language Film nod, and rightfully so. Every
shot from cinematographer Christian Berger
("Cach6") is as perfectly bleak, joyless and
hopeless as Haneke could have crafted. His
wizardry is in taking the perfectly pleasant
aesthetic of a little German village dotted with
wooden houses, horse-drawn carriages and
bales of hay beside a barn and transforming it
into the gates of Hell.
The film is not satisfying in the traditional
sense to which we are accustomed - "boy
meets girl, boy loses girl, boy reclaims girl"
should never be expected from perpetual
downer Haneke. "The White Ribbon" is not
about closure or circularity. It's not about stum-
bling across a crime scene and tracking down
the culprit. It's about the lessons taught by a
generation in power to its children, and those
are seldom as simple as we'd like them to be. It
might not provide any answers, but "The White
Ribbon" asks questions brilliantly.

Ilove Lucy. I really do. Ilove
everything about Lucille Ball
from her bright orange hair
and poofy
'50s dresses
to her vita-
meataveg-
amin and her
chocolate
factory
antics. She's
an icon of -
comedy, TV CAROLYN
and Ameri- KLARECKI
cana and
deservedly
so. Lucille Ball was a BAMF.
Surprisingly, my Lucy rants
haven't been met with unbridled
passion and enthusiasm. In fact,
most people are indifferent to
Lucy, or worse. It's a sad truth, but
because she portrayed a housewife
in an era when feminism and sex-
ism were at the forefront of the
culture war, Lucy has a bit of a bad
rap. Here's the thing: Lucille Ball
was anything but the complacent
housewife figure she portrayed.
Like most earlytelevision
shows, "I Love Lucy" started on
the radio and due to its popularity
on the air, the switch to TV made
perfect sense. Lucy's producers
urged her to follow what most
shows at a the were doing: shoot-
ing live in New York.
But stubborn Lucy wanted oth-
erwise. According to the Museum
of Broadcast Communications,
because she didn't want to uproot
her life for the purpose of a TV
show, she convinced her producers
to shoot in California. She insisted
that her shows be recorded on film
in front of a live studio audience
using three cameras. In doing so,
Ball legitimized Hollywood as
a site for producing TV. She was
at the forefront of multi-camera
formats, which would eventually
become the industry standard for
sitcoms. Her archived episodes of
"I Love Lucy" were the firstshows
to be syndicated and aired as
reruns, making her a national sen-
sation and creating a legacy that
has lasted decades.
Not only did she make these
technical revolutions to the indus-
try, she also shook up the cultural
world of TV. Every Lucy fan knows
the famous thick Cuban accent
yelling in sing-song, "Lucy, I'm
home?" But not many have stopped
to think about the implications of
a multi-racial relationship in the
1950s. We take Lucy and Ricky's
TV marriage for granted. We know
they were always meant to be
together, but TV executives didn't
see it that way.
They were convinced that an
all-American redhead and Cuban
American would never make a
believable TV couple and asked

Lucy to cast a nice white man as her
husband. Of course, Lucy wouldn't
have it; she wanted to cast her
actual husband Desi Arnaz to fill
the role. We all know how the story
ends: The execs gave in and Ameri-
can audiences embraced Ricky and
Lucy as a loving couple.
It's also often overlooked
that the show was produced in
the height of the Red Scare and
McCarthy era. Everybody in the
entertainment business was at risk
of being blacklisted for beingcom-
munist and Lucy was no exception
and was named and subpoenaed
by the House Committee on Un-
American Activites. What is sig-
nificant, however, is that Lucy was
a communist - or at least had once
voted Communist, unlike many of
those accused.
And while Charlie Chaplin and
Arthur Miller were blacklisted due
to their alleged political allegiance,
How Lucy
changed TV.
McCarthy and his cronies couldn't
keep loveable Lucy away from TV.
Desi Arnaz said, "The onlything
Red about Lucy is her hair, and
even that's not legitimate," and
that sentiment allowed her to keep
producing her shows.
Lucille Ball combated and then
revolutionized industry norms,
fought against racial prejudices
and circumvented McCarthy. She
was an unstoppable force. But she
was a housewife. She did cook and
clean and contribute to that Mrs.
Cleaver image that ran rampant
in'50s TV. But if you look a little
closer at Lucy, you'll realize how
much of a role model for women
she really was.
She set a precedent for women.
Shewas the first femaletobe a
studio head, but her on-screen
character was just as ballsy as the
Lucy behind the scene. She was the
first nationally recognized woman
comedian and thus an inspiration.
Because she was funny, loud and
scheming, regular women could
follow her lead. Ricky respected
her in spite of (and also because
of) her zany antics, even with his
scolding "Lucy! You've got some
'splainin' to do!"
Lucy meant a lot to women. She
made them laugh and let them
know they could make others
laugh, too. She wasn'tjust another
TV housewife. I love Lucy and you
should too.

housewife. To be her Ricky, e-mail

Little drama, lots of chocolate

By ANT MITCHELL
Daily Arts Writer
When little people and chocolate
come together on TV, you might
expect cutesy Oompa Loompa-
esque entertain-
ment. The two
little people star-
ring in TLC's newe
reality TV show e
"Little Chocolat- Chocolatiers
iers" don't sing,
and they aren't Tuesdays
orange. But it's at10 p.m.
fun as fudge to TLC
watch them build
life-size desks,
books and cassette tapes from
chocolate, as well as dip limes, cel-
ery, bleu cheese and God knows
what else into melted confection.
The two owners, Kate and
Steve, are an odd mix of person-
alities. Kate is creative and enthu-
siastic while Steve is grouchy and
awkward (and maybe just a touch
obnoxious). Together, they make a
couple with ridiculously non-exis-

tent chemistry.
When teve sets up a roman-
tic surprise dinner for his wife on
their anniversary, there has never
been a more anti-climactic (and
undoubtedly sexless) celebration
of marriage. But despite the odd
character quirks and the lack of
any discernible sexual attraction
between the couple, they're sur-
prisingly likeable, and they cer-
tainly can run a chocolateria with
their super team of equally awk-
ward teenage employees.
"Little Chocolatiers" is pleas-
antly different from regular cook-
ing shows in which they make
fancy creations and then leave it on
a display platter to be admired. Not
here. We get to see that chocolate
radio get smashed to bits and those
chocolate books chewed up and
crumbled by ravenous students
with a will to destroy the creations
of the chocolatiers.

OPERA PREVIEW
Eco-friendly
opera
Die Zauberflote
Tonight and tomorrow
at 7:30 p.m.
Walgreen Drama Center
The School of Music, Theatre
& Dance will host two free Opera
Studio performances of a short-
ened version of Mozart's opera
"Die Zauberflfte" ("The Magic
Flute") in Stamps Auditorium of
the Walgreen Drama Center. The
opera will be performed in Ger-
man with English supertitles and
is directed by Associate Professor
of Music Robert Swedberg.
Composed in 1791, "Die Zau-
berfl6te" is a singspiel, a Ger-
man form of opera that includes

forming in support of Haiti relief.
Local bands including Great
Divide, Fair Herald, Mr. Fiction and
Teenage Octopus will play in the
First Annual Band Jam, presented
by MServe and the Blind Pig, with
proceeds going to the American
Red Cross.
The bands will be competing for
a chance to perform on Sept. 6 at
"Hilltopia," an opportunity to per-
form as an opening act for a head-
lining band. Record executives,
talent booking agents and local
record store owners will be present
both song and spoken word. This
particular opera is highly influ-
enced by the philosophy of the
Enlightenment and has remained
extremely popular since its debut
in Vienna shortly after its compo-
sition.
The School of Music, Theatre &
Dance teamed up with the School
of Engineering and Environmen-
tal Science Departments to pres-
ent the performance as a "green
opera."
This collaboration has ensured
a more environmentally con-
scious production.
The opera follows a young
prince on his quest to save his
future bride from captivity
with the help of a magical flute.
Although they are fantastic, the
obstacles he encounters in his
endeavors can be appreciated by
any college student who has had
to face the various hurdles that
come with higher education.

to judge the competition while DJ
Snagtoof provides music all night.
Dan Brown, lead singer and gui-
tarist for Mr. Fiction, expressed his
excitement about playing his first
upcomingshow with the band.
"We got started in October,"
Brown said.
"We've all been playing for a long
time though."
The opportunity to play at an
established venue was another
draw for Brown.
"It's a good opportunity to get
out in the scene of Ann Arbor and

play in a venue like the Blind Pig.
I'm excited aboutour chance to play
in the Blind Pig. Hopefully people
will like us enough to get our name
out," Brown said.
Doors are at 8 p.m., and perfor-
mances start at 8:30. Tickets are
available online or at the door for $5
with a student ID.

For Wednesday, April 7, 2010
ARIES
(March 21lto April 19)
Be extra patient with others today,
especially in group situations - meet-
ings, conferences and conventions, or
classes. People are too quick to be irrita-
ble.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Don't lose your temper in public
today, because this is the kind of day
where important people will notice you,
especially regarding details of your pri-
vate life. You might want to count to
three before you reply to others.
GEMINI
(May 21to June 20)
Avoid disputes about racial issues,
politics and religion today. Your knee-
jerk response to somebody might be
something you will regret later. (Oops.)
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
Conflict about shared property or
shared responsibilities for someone or
something could arise today. Don't get
your belly in a rash. Calm yourself
before you respond to others.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Tension between partners and close
friends is likely today. However, it takes
two to make a fight. Keep this in mind.
Mum's the word.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Demonstrate grace under pressure at
work today, because co-workers and
custorners might easily irritate you. But
what is the point of losing patience? It
only makes everyone miserable, includ-
ing you:
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Be extra patient with children today.
Similarly, romance might be in the toilet.
Just remind yourself that you love these
people!

SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Do what you can to keep the peace at
home today. Family harmony is impor-
tant. Not only is harmony more pleasant,
it actually promotes health and happi-
ness.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Guard against irritable responses to
siblings and relatives today. Rude
remarks only make us more irritable
with ourselves! Patience and kindness
make us feel better. (Weird but true.)
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Avoid making hasty or snap decisions
about financial matters today. Think
before you reply. Similarly, if you're

Hutchins opens up, reflects
on season's success so far

Kittle fills void in
left field for Blue

By LUKE PASCH
Dahly Sports Writer
It's not an easy task to get Michi-
gan softball coach Carol Hutchins
to open up to the public: she's
incredibly protective of her play-
ers.
But for one hour on Monday
night at Ann
Arbor's Pizza NOTEBOOK
House, she and
a few of her All-American ath-
letes were featured on the "Michi-
gan Athletics Coaches' Show" on
WTKA 1050AM to give a behind-
the-scenes look at the team.
And for that hour, fans got to see
the animated side of "Hutch" that's
typically reserved for her players.
She laughed and occasionally
teased one of her players in the
audience.
She was enthused when she talk-
ed about the newest bleacher addi-
tions to Alumni Field.
And she even revealed the girls'
secret formula for success - listen-
ing to Lady Gaga in the clubhouse
before games.
Even she admitted that the 2009
breakout artist gets her worked up.
WHAT A SEASON: The sec-
ond-ranked Wolverines (3-0 Big
Ten, 26-5 overall) have impressed
everyone so far on the 2010 cam-
paign.
And as they head into their two-
month stretch of Big Ten play, they
are stronger than ever, having won
18 of their last 19 contests.
They've been beating other
ranked opponents and humiliating
unranked ones.
Those accomplishments beg the
questions - is this the best team
Hutchins has coached in her 26
years at the helm? Are they even
better than the 2005 NCAA Cham-
pionship team?
And although she didn't nec-
essarily make that claim, she did
draw comparisons.
"It really does remind me of 2005

ductive," Hutchins said. "They've
done such a great job. When you
got somebody that's as potent as
Nikki Nemitz hitting in the seven-
hole, the pitchers just don't get a
break when they face us."
But praising her formidable
lineup doesn't mean the coach has
thrown modesty out the window.
When asked if she thinks the
team would top off this week's
NCAA rankings after No. 1 Wash-
ington's loss to No. 5 UCLA last
weekend, Hutchins bluntly denied
it.
THE HOUSE THAT WILPON
BUILT: The Michigan softball team
plays in one of the plushest college
facilities in the nation.
Alumni Field, part of the Wilpon
Softball and Baseball Complex, has
experienced renovations over the
last few years with the $4 million it

funding provided by the Judy and
Fred Wilpon Family Foundation.
But some of the upgrades took
some getting used to. At the close
of the 2009 season, renovators
went to work on constructing the
new right field bleachers, which
effectively stripped the grassy
knoll seating that players' families
had grown to love.
"I used to sit out in right field
on lawn chairs and get there three
hours early to get my spot, so I was
a little sad to see that go," Nemitz
said. "Now that I saw what they
did, I'm not sad at all. I love it."
A TEAM VACATION: For
Hutchins, few things are more
important than team chemistry.
And to foster that chemistry, she
took her team on a springbreak trip
to Fort Benning, Ga., where she and
the players had an opportunity to
talk to Army officials and explore

the National Infantry Museum.
They even got to ride in a tank and
take some shots at a firing range.
And this trip was particularly
meaningful for Hutchins, whoes
nephew is currently in Afghani-
stan.
"I just thought that the whole
thing was very educational,"
Hutchins said. "They say these
guys spend up to 14 hours at a time
in the tanks. The temperature gets
up to 140 degrees when you're in a
desert.
"So it's good for our kids to see
what the rest of the world is doing."
In Hutchins's mind, this type of
experience was the perfect oppor-
tunity to instill a sense of team
unity in her players.
And time will tell if it pays off,
as the team heads down the sea-
son's home-stretch in the ensuing
weeks.

A Friend Dies. Who Cares?

Toxic drinking is an epidemic on
campuses all across America.
It means consuming so much alcohol
the drinker passes out. But while "sleeping
it off," the victim may be quietly dying.
When you come right down to it, students
themselves are the best ones to tackle
this problem. So, in growing numbers,
Stony Brook students have joined together
in the Red Watch Band movement.
Working with experts, they fine-tuned a
course in techniques to handle these
alcohol emergencies. Red Watch Band
members can act fast, when every second
counts.They know the quick steps they
can take to rescue a passed-out student
from a drinking death, and can immediately
summon professional help. Everyone
completing the course is given the
distinctive red watch for identification.
Since its inception at Stony Brook
University in March 2009, approximately
40 schools across the country have signed
on to implement this lifesaving program.

available until the ban on deny-
ing coverage to patients with pre-
existing conditions takes effect in
six months, Stabenow said.
In response to a question from
an audience member about how
the public should understand the
complex bill, Stabenow said that
different aspects of the bill will
affect different groups of people.
"Everyone will have a different
focus depending on who they are,"
she said.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily, Stabenow said one of
the most important aspects of the
bill for students is that it allows
them to stay on their parents'
health insurance plans until age
26. If their parents do not have
insurance, Stabenow said, the
students will have the option of a
low-cost young adult plan.
Stabenow also told The Daily
that with the new legislation stu-
dents should seriously consider
going into the health care profes-
sion.

pal League, 46 percent of students
graduating from public universi-
ties in Michigan in 2007 had left
the state by the spring of 2008.
Public Policy senior Matthew
Wald said he's experienced the
struggle of trying to find a job first
hand, and has been searching for
jobs in the public sector in Wash-
ington D.C. since February.
"It seems like the applicant pool
is a lot more competitive given the
state of the economy right now,"
Wald said. "I feel like most years I
would be very competitive for the
jobs that I'm applying for, but it's
just such a competitive applicant
pool that a lot of agencies or orga-
nizations are weeding out candi-
dates who don't have professional
work or experience yet."
Wald said he is trying to stay
focused and keep his options open,
but that he's hoping to land a job
with a campaign team he interned
with last August.

She said the new legislation
will vastly increase the numher
of people who are able to afford
medical care, resulting in a "huge
boon for the health care industry,"
which is partially why, according
to Stabenow, the American Medi-
cal Association supported the bill.
With the new pool of customers,
she said, there will be a greater
demand for health care profes-
sionals.
As an incentive for students to
go into the health care field, the
bill also increases funding for
scholarships, loans and grants for
students working towards careers
in health care. Stabenow said
there's also a student loan repay-
ment program for graduates who
work in health care for at least
three years.
According to Stabenow, there
will be cuts in funding for health
care institutions because they will
have more customers, but she said
the bill does not explicitly call
for cuts in doctors' and nurses'
incomes.
Keeping in mind her audience,
LSA senior Sarah Neuman,
student coordinator of the Pub-
lic Service Internship Program at
The Career Center, said she's also
used connections she formed as an
intern in order to arrange inter-
views with prospective employers.
In addition to taking advantage
of her connections, Neuman said
she's also been using The Career
Center's website to look for jobs.
"My experience actually is that
there are a number of jobs avail-
able," Neuman said. "It's just not
necessarily jobs that I am thrilled
about doing, but I don't feel that
there's a shortage of work out
there."
Sebille-Whitesaid some expand-
ing fields like alternative energy
technologies and social media are
beginning to see an increase in hir-
ing.
Engineering senior Amar Anand
will join the product management
staff of Facebook as one of about
300 engineers a few days after
graduation.
Anand said he started applying
for jobs in December 2009, and

Stahenow highlighted preventive
care as one of the most crucial fea-
tures of the legislation.
"There is a major new focus on
prevention that all of you will be
involved with," Stabenow said.
According to Stabenow, all new
health plans will be required to
provide free preventive care with
no co-pays or deductibles, and
there will be incentives for people
to participate in "healthy lifestyle
programs."
She concluded the talk on a very
optimistic note, saying the politi-
cal dynamic is going to change
from "Do we want health care
reform or not?" to "How do we
make this work?"
She said there will be many
opportunities down the road to
build on the bill, including a re-
examination of the public option,
which she said she supports.
"It's allup toyouguys on how we
move forward," she said. "There's
a framework...and a value system,
but we are just in the beginning of
a process that each one of you will
help us shape."
that he applied to about 20 compa-
nies.
"I took this pretty seriously," he
said.
He said he gave a Facebook
executive his resume last semes-
ter at a University "tech talk" - an
informational meeting between
Engineeringstudents and prospec-
tive employers. After several inter-
views, Facebook offered Anand the
job in early March.
Beginning the job hunt early
definitely gives students an advan-
tage, Sebille-White said.
"Those students who start their
search six to nine months before
they graduate and are actively
engaged are more likely to be
employed at graduation or shortly
after graduation," she said.
The Career Center is not a place-
ment office, Sebille-White said, but
advisors can help students find out
how their passions translate into
real-world employment opportuni-
ties.
"There's hardly job security
anymore," Sebille-White said. "You
might as well do what you love."

ment's recommendations."
Inan interview with The Michi-
gan Daily on Sunday afternoon,
Councilmember Margie Teall (D-
Ward 4) said she was one of the few
councilmembers who supported
the 2004 ordinance when it was
first proposed.
She cited the potential safety
risks as the primary reason for
backing the proposal. But the ordi-
nance faced considerable opposi-
tion within the community, where
it was widely perceived as being
too invasive, Teall said.

booming population of autowork-
ers, she said.
Person discussed the "daunt-
ing challenge" of trying to revital-
ize Flint and said that, in doing so,
she is trying to make connections
between the University and busi-
nesses in the city.
In terms of admissions at the
campus, Person said that applica-
tions are on the rise and they are
continuing to work on revising
admissions standards to "accept a
better student body."
Like the University's Ann Arbor
campus, the Flint campus also
received a report from the Higher
Learning Commission last month,
which recommended reaccrediting
the campus with no further stipu-
lations.
Person also updated SACUA on
a series of administrative changes
at the Flint campus. Current Pro-
vost Jack Kay will become Provost
and Executive Vice President at
Eastern Michigan University start-
ing in July. After a search, Gerard
Voland - currently the dean of
engineering at Indiana University-
Purdue University Fort Wayne -
will assume the provost positionatl
the Flint campus come July.
"I'm really looking forward to
working with Gerard and hav-
ing the interim folks, who've done
a great job, go back to what they
were doing," Person said.
She added that the campus will
also acquire two new deans in
health and education.
Because the Flint campus's
current strategic plan, which
addresses planning for admissions
and academics as well as other
affairs of the campus, expires in
2010, Person said officials have
begun to develop a new plan that
she said she hopes will be drafted
by January 2011. Person said she
is currently developing a steering
committee and sub-committee for

year and that providing tickets
for the event is focused first on
the graduating students and their
families.
"This event is for the graduat-
ing students and their families,
so tickets will go to the students
and their families," Cunningham
said. "The needs they have as far
as tickets is the top priority."
Cunningham said there is no
way to estimate how many left-
over tickets will be available, and
it will remain unknown until all

graduating students pick up their
tickets. She indicated that it is
possible that there may be very
few left by the time all the tick-
ets for graduating students are
accounted for.
"We expect that there will be
a great interest in any extra tick-
ets that we might have and you
know we will try to accommodate
everyone, but graduating students
and their families are the top pri-
ority," Cunningham said.
The press release instructs
graduating students to take only
the amount of tickets they need
and not to sell additional unneed-
ed tickets, noting that this offense
may result in the revoking of the
student's tickets or even punish-
ment by law.
Cunningham said that she
doesn't think scalping will be a
major problem, as students have
been notified various times to take
only the amount of tickets needed.

Kevin Warner was quoted in the
2004 article as saying that the fire
may have started after a couch on
the porch caught fire.
A similar incident occurred in
April 2008, when a house on Ben-
jamin Street was set ablaze after a
fire on a couch on the porch spread
to the house's interior, according
to an April 16, 2008 Daily article.
The fire - which quickly became
"out of control," according to an
observer quoted in the story - left
five University residents displaced,
the article reported.
As of the conclusion of last
night's meeting, City Council had
not addressed whether or not it

would reevaluate the 2004 ordi-
nance.
The Ann Arbor fire and police
departments are still investigating
the series of suspicious fires, which
took place at residences near cam-
pus on Saturday morning. A crime
alert sent out by the Department
of Public Safety to the University
community on Saturday warned
community members about the
fires and asked them to take pre-
cautions.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown told the Daily on Saturday
night that she could not comment
on whether the Saturday morning
fires were linked to one another.

meeting of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs.

the strategic planning process.
"It's been a great discussion
for me getting to know different
faculty and them helping us work
through populating that process,"
Person said. "It's been a very col-
laborative process."
Person said that the challenge
for the University's Flint campus
will be determining the enroll-
ment capacity of the campus and
then figuring out how that fits into
the operations of the campus as a
whole.
In terms of relationships with
the community, Person spoke
about the Flint campus's unique
opportunity for junior and senior
high school students in the area
to dual enroll both at their high
schools and at the University.
High school students can partic-
ipate in this program by indicating
"I don't think it will be a major
issue because we believe that the
students who will be graduating
will take the number that they
need and leave the rest," Cun-
ningham said. "We've been really
clear that the tickets are not to be
sold or exchanged for any reason."
First-year Rackham student
Rohit Singh said that he antici-
pates that students may try to
sell additional tickets but doesn't
think it will be a major problem.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they
tried to sell them," Singh said "But
at the same time, I don't know if
that many seniors are really out
there to make that much money
off them."
Many non-graduating students
at the University have expressed
interest in attending the event.
LSA freshman Derek Tinkle, a
Democrat who said he identifies
with the President's ideologies,
said he is looking forward to hear-
ing his speech.
"I think it's a big deal," Tinkle
said. "I just think we're really
lucky to even have the President
talk to us. I'm personally a liber-
al, and I think there's a lot that I
can learn from what he has to talk
about."
Tinkle said that he thinks it
will be difficult for non-gradu-
ating students attempting to get
tickets on April 29, noting that it is
even hard to get tickets for small
concerts at MUTO.
"There'll be a lot of chaos, I
think," Tinkle said. "Just in gen-
eral, even for concerts, even small
concerts, there's always a long line

interest in the health profession
and they pay a reduced fee to attend
classes, Person said. But she also
acknowledged the possibility that
current Flint students could be
displaced with this influx of high
school students through the pro-
gram.
Because Flint currently faces
many economic challenges, Per-
son said the city could be used as
an incubator to explore issues that
occur in smaller cities.
"We have the opportunity to
develop a unique role and that is
to be much more focused on sort of
small city, urban kinds of issues, as
they both pertain to higher educa-
tion," Person said. "(Flint) is a great
laboratory when you think about
it, for all kinds of social, academic,
environmental and business kinds
of issues."
for when they just start selling
tickets. I would think there should
probably be more places you can
buy the tickets from."
Nursing sophomore Breann
Eckerle said that while she will
be leaving for home after finals
rather than staying for com-
mencement, she thinks it would
be a good experience, especially
because she voted for Obama in
the 2008 presidential election.
"I think it would be really cool
just because this past election
was the first time I could vote, so
it was kind of a big deal," Eckerle
said. "I did vote for him, so it was
exciting. I just think it would be
really cool to see him speak."
Eckerle said though she antici-
pates student attempts to obtain
tickets to be chaotic, she thinks
'that it will work as efficiently as
it did for events like the Kid Cudi
concert earlier this semester.
"I know earlier in the semester
they had the Kid Cudi concert,
and they were selling tickets. It
was busy, but I think it would be
OK for this," Eckerle said. "And
it's convenient. I think it's a good
idea to have it (at MUTO)."
LSA freshman Lindsey Karp
said that she won't be upset if she
isn't able to attend the commence-
ment but that it is still monu-
mental for him to come to the
University.
"If I don't go it's not the end of
the world. I'm not adamant about
it," Karp said. "But it's a big deal
for him to come here. It's not often
that you can see the President,
especially at home."
