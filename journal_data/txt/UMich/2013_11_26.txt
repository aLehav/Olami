Faculty represent
various science
departments
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Eight University professors,
hailing from the fields of psy-
chology, dentistry, biological sci-
ences and ecology, were named
as fellows with the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science fellows Monday. They
were among the 388 AAAS Fel-
lows receiving the prestigious
recognition this year.
The fellows were nominated
by their peers, based on their
contributions to the advance-
ment of science or its applica-
tions. Last year, the University
had 19 AAAS fellows - the most
of any other institution.
AAAS is the world's largest
scientific society and selects fel-
lows who have been members of
the association for four years. In
order to become a fellow, mem-
bers must be nominated by three

previous fellows, one of the 24
steering groups of AAAS' sec-
tions or the AAAS chief execu-
tive officer. The policymaking
council then votes on nominees
and constructs the final list.
Fellow Bradley Cardinale,
an associate professor of ecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology and
natural resources and environ-
ment, is researching how biodi-
versity can benefit humans.
Cardinale's lab conducted data
syntheses from more than 1,600
ecosystems worldwide. These
studies revealed the relationship
between the number of species
and the environment's produc-
tivity. Productive environments
include crops repellent to dis-
ease, lakes producing more oxy-
gen and forests with a high wood
yield.
This means that preventing
extinction is favorable for people;
a greater variety of species pro-
motes a slew of human benefits.
"There's an increasingnumber
of examples that show that bio-
diversity affects you and things
you care about," Cardinale said.

* HEALTH
Smoking ban
to evolve with
incoming pres.

Coleman will leave
having inspired a
healthier campus
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman will leave behind
a healthier student body when
her appointment ends this sum-
mer.
July will mark three years
since the University made its
campus smoke-free through
the Smoke-Free University
{ Initiative, which the Univer-
sity administration hopes to
improve and expand under the
incoming president.
The Smoke-Free University
Initiative was developed under
MHealthy, a presidential ini-
tiative established in 2005 that
encouraged a healthier com-
munity through cost-effective
health delivery, public discus-
sions about healthy living and
campaigns like the smoking
ban.
When the initiative was pro-
posed, the University waited
two years to make implementa-
tion plans.
"I think campuses that tried
to (ban smoking) from one day
S to the next with no prepara-
tion just didn't work," Coleman
said in a 2011 interview."So this
gives us some time, and we'll try
to resolve the issues. I think it's
the right way to go."
a After approving the ban,

Coleman took a hands-off
approach to the planning and
implementation ofthe initiative.
Robert Winfield, chief health
officer and director of Universi-
ty Health Service, spearheaded
the operation.
In the two years spent
researching, five committees
representing different aspects
of campus developed question-
naires, held town halls and
organized student focus groups.
"Primarily, they wanted to
be sure that the program was
respectful to smokers and it
wouldn't in some way demean
them and make them into some
kind of pariah," Winfield said of
student input. "The principle of
the program was being respect-
ful to smokera, (but) creating an
environment on campus that
was not smoke-welcome."
From this research, the Uni-
versity chose not to install "butt
huts" to allow for the disposal
of finished cigarettes, believ-
ing it would encourage smoking
rather than stifle it. It also chose
to allow smoking on sidewalks
adjacent to road in an effort to
prevent smokers from moving
onto the property of city busi-
nesses.
Marsha Benz, alcohol and
other drugs health educator for
UHS, consulted student focus
groups in her role in the devel-
opment of the campaign. She
said they expressed a desire to
see posters that showed them
what else they could be spend-
ing their cigarette money on,

FOOTBALL
Struggling
team says 'All
bets are off'
vs. Buckeyes
The Wolverines goals
have dwindled, all
that remains is a win
over Ohio State
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Sure, the Michigan football team
has squandered its Big Ten title
hopes. Sure, redshirt junior quarter-
back Devin Gardner has been beaten,
bruised and battered the past four
games. Sure, the Wolverines haven't
shown a propensity for moving the
ball consistently.
But come Saturday, none of that
matters to them.
Fifth-year senior left tackle Taylor
Lewan has several hopes for when
Ohio State comes to town, which
include fans potentially putting aside
Michigan's less-than-ideal record
and Michigan Stadium being filled
with maize and blue instead of scarlet
and gray.
In a game as big as The Game, pre-
conceived notions don't mean a thing
to the Wolverines.
"Saturday, all bets are off," Lewan
said. "We're playing football. Any-
thing could happen Saturday."
And why does he think the Wolver-
ines would be capable of pulling what
would be the biggest upset of the sea-
son?
"Because we have heart."
In a season in which very little has
gone according to plan, pride is the
only thing the Wolverines have left
to play for. Michigan coach Brady
Hoke scheduled a team practice early

Seniors' business
caters to Greek
life, athletes
By WILLIAM LANE
For the Daily
One year ago, LSA senior
Harris Markowitz and Busi-
ness senior Daniel Matian
founded Bar2Bar Transport,
a bus service marketed as a
social alternative to taxi cabs.
Now, the duo's LED-lit buses
are a frequent sight off cam-
pus.
For a fixed fee of $3 per per-
son, groups of up to 15 people
can hire a Bar2Bar bus any-
where in Ann Arbor between

10 p.m. and 3 a.m.
Geared for partiers, the
mini-buses are furnished with
LED lighting and speakers.
Alcohol is permitted onboard
for those of age.
Markowitz said despite
being price-competitive with
local taxi services, he believes
the social aspect of the ride
has a competitive advantage
over alternatives.
"It's not just a ride; it's part
of a night out," Markowitz
said.
Because of its ability to
cater to groups, the service
has become popular among
the Greek community and
athletes who want to go to
bars or parties together.
The company owns two

15- passenger shuttles, each
driven by licensed drivers.
Max Sanders, a manager
at Scorekeepers Bar and Grill
and co-owner of Bar2Bar, said
the startup has had a posi-
tive influence on business at
Skeeps.
"Itdefinitelyhelps," he said.
"In my experience, most peo-
ple come in groups of 15 to 20,
so getting them there quickly
and easily is more efficient
and keeps them together."
Currently, Matian and
Markowitz are focusing on
publicizing and patenting the
ability for users to purchase a
ride from their phone. A pur-
chased "ride code" provided
by the app eliminates the need

Anthony Collings is a lecturer
in the University's Department
of Communications Studies and
has worked at the University since
1997. He is a former foreign and
Washington correspondent for
CNN, and was part of a team that
won anEmmyfor their coverage of
the Oklahoma City bombing.
What made you decide to
come and teach at the
University?
I wanted to be in the Midwest
because Ihave three sons and two
of them were living in Chicago at
the time. I was offered a position
as the visiting Howard R. Marsh
Professor of Journalism in the

Communications Studies Depart-
ment, which brings in a journalist
for a year to teach. I did that for
two years, then I became a lec-
turer in Communication Studies,
which is my current position. It
was a good offer and Michigan
has a very good reputation.
In this day and age, which is
journalisticallybetter:
speedy coverage or fully
informed coverage?
In journalism they say it's bet-
ter to be right than to be first. I
don't think the general public
cares whether or not one orga-
nization beat another organi-
zation by one or two minutes,

even though news organizations
seem to think it's very important.
It's the Internet that's changed
things. CNN and Fox both got the
Supreme Court decision wrong
about the Affordable Care Act,
and that was because they didn't
wait until the Chief Justice had
finished speaking. That's a very
good example of rushing a story
out too quickly, and it speaks to
the fact that when every news
organization has a website, it
increases the time pressure on
journalists.

Yale 'U' Police: campus safe

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP)
- Yale University was locked

a phone call saying an armed
man was heading to shoot it up,
a warning they later said was
likely a hoax.
SWAT teams searching the
Ivy League campus didn't find

Monday's search came sever-

Connecticut campus.

Controversial
actions justified
with 'security', met
with criticism
CAIRO (AP) - Egyptian gov-
ernment officials on Monday
defended a new law that sharply
restricts the right to protest as
needed to bring security, trying
to counter a storm of criticism
from allies and opponents alike
who say the rules stifle freedom
of expression and endanger the
country's democratic transition.
The law, issued by the inter-
im president a day earlier, bans
public gatherings of more than
10 people without prior govern-
ment approval, imposing hefty
fines and prison terms for viola-
tors. It also empowered security
agencies to use force to break up
protests.
The protest law has caused
cracks in the loose coalition of
secular and non-Islamist groups
that rallied behind the military-
backed government installed
following the ouster of elected
Islamist President Mohammed
Morsi in July.
Morsi supporters have been
holding constant protests since
his fall, often descending into
bloody clashes amid a rising
wave of violence. But opponents
of the new law, including among
those who have backed the gov-
ernment, say it will silence all
critics - and that it goes against
the spirit of the protest move-
ments that ousted autocrat
Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and rose
up against Morsi, pavingthe way
for the coup that removed him.
The government portrays it as
a measure to restore security and
stability and help the country's
economy - arguments that have
strong resonance with an Egyp-
tian public weary with violence.
"There will be no economy
without security and a stable
political environment now and in
the future," interim Prime Min
ister Hazem el-Beblawi said, at

a government meeting in which
the law was discussed, according
to the state news agency.
He saidsome intheopposition
aim to create "confusion and sow
mistrust betweenthe authorities
and the public."
Egypt's powerful military
chief, the man who removed
Morsi, weighed in as well, urging
political factions and the media
to support the transition pro-
cess and line up behind a push to
restore security - though he did
not specifically mention the law.
Political groups should drop
"criteria and considerations that
don't fit the reality Egypt is liv-
ing and the challenges it faces,"
Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said,
pointing to security threats,
includingthe increasingmilitant
attacks in the Sinai Peninsula.
"The political, economic and
social challenges Egypt faces
need effort and will and a correct
understanding of the require-
ments of this phase," el-Sissi said
at a meeting of officers, accord-
ing to MENA.
He said a number of measures
under way will "correct the
democratic path and establish
a regime that pleases all Egyp-
tians."
It was an apparent reference
to the new protest law and a
drive to finish amendingthe con-
stitution.
In the latest violence, attack-
ers on a motorcycle threw a gre-
nade at a police checkpoint near
a historic royal palace in Cairo,
wounding at least one guard,
according to MENA.
Interior Minister Moham-
med Ibrahim, in charge of police,
insisted the protest law doesn't
undermine the right to peace-
ful expression, as he met with
top security officers on how to
implement it, starting Monday.
"The law grants the right to
organize public gatherings, con-
voys, and peaceful protests and
to join them, in accordance with
the law," Ibrahim said according
to the state news agency MENA.
Among the restrictions, how-
ever, would-be protesters must

seek a permit for their gather-
ing three days in advance, which,
security officials can turn down
with little explanation, requir-
ing the applicants to turn to the
courts to appeal.
Rights groups, secular politi-
cal parties and activists, who
had lobbied against protest law,
said that despite an initialuproar
over an earlier draft of the law,
the final version had only small
changes.
"It gives a legal cover to
repression," said the Popular
Current, a group led by leftist
politician Hamdeen Sabahy, who
had backedtheremoval of Morsi.
The group said the law "is not
befitting for a country that had
two revolts in two years mainly
against repression."
In a snub to the law, the youth
activist group April 6 and other
political groups held a rally out-
side a central Cairo police station
Monday, calling on the govern-
ment to "eat popcorn!"- a joke
to say the government is wasting
time.
They mockingly presented a
request to organize a rally they
said will be attended by 10 mil-
lion Egyptians.
The military-backed inter-
im government, meanwhile, is
pushing through with a politi-
cal road map that calls for new
presidential and parliamentary
elections next year.
The prime minister, el-Beb-
lawi, said Monday that a key first
step in the process - a referen-
dum on amendments in the con-
stitution - will likely take place
in the second half of January. He
did not give a precise date, which
is still to be announced by the
interim president.
The 50-member appointed
panel is still working on amend-
ing the 2012 constitution,
mainly drafted by Islamists and
approved under Morsi.
The process is also seeing a
risingchorus of criticism against
the secrecy of its discussions and
a number of articles that have
granted the next president great-
er powers.

Unlucky sibling of
pardoned turkeys
meets governor
With two other turkeys ticket-

White House, their brother met
Minnesota's governor Monday at
a state Capitol ceremony featuring
much of the same upbeat pageant-
ry ahead of a far gloomier fate for
the bird.
Jokingly dubbed "Delicious"
by a farmer traveling with the
20-pound gobbler, the unfortu-
nate turkey enjoyed only a brief
stay of execution - not a reprieve
- during a ceremony laced with
gallows humor at Gov. Mark Day-
ton's Capitol office.
The next stop for the pink and
white bird: a trip to the St. Paul
Salvation Army and, eventually,
dinner for the less-fortunate.
Conversely, his two brothers
are headed to the White House
Wednesday where they'll be offi-
cially spared.

1 Cyprus leaders halt

reunification talks
The rival leaders of ethnically
divided Cyprus on Monday failed
to agree on resuming stalled
talks aimed at reunifying the
country.
Cyprus President Nicos Anas-
tasiades and Turkish Cypriot
leader Dervis Eroglu said after
an informal meeting that obsta-
cles remain in restarting full-
fledged peace negotiations.
"Unfortunately, there's still
some way to go before we can
arrive at the hoped-for result,"
Anastasiades said after emerg-
ing from the three-hour meeting
at a restaurant inside the United
Nations-controlled buffer zone
dividing the capital.
Cyprus was split into an inter-
nationally recognized Greek
Cypriot south and a breakaway
" Turkish Cypriot north in 1974
when Turkey invaded after a
coup by supporters of union
with Greece. Turkish Cypriots
declared independence in 1983,
but on Turkey, which maintains
35,000 troops there, recognize

Students noted that trying to
quit could be more expensive
than maintaining the habit, so
the University offers smokers
free patches, lozenges, gum and
other consultations if they join a
weekly smoking support group.
The University also decided
that enforcing the initiative
should not be punitive, but
rather rooted in changing social
norms. In addition to posters,
stenciled sidewalk chalk mes-
sages appeared during Welcome
Week and in smoker hotspots in

enforce the initiative and do not
issue tickets to people smok-
ing on campus. Instead, stu-
dents can file a complaint about
smokers at the Office of Stu-
dent Conflict Resolution, while
supervisors handle complaints
from faculty and staff.
"The principle that we went
for was treating people with

the effectiveness of those two
years of research, as well as the
decision to approach enforce-
ment through a collective
effort. The survey reported that
the number of people who said
they smoked dropped from six
to four percent. Thirteen per-
cent of faculty and staff said
the initiative helped influence
their decision or attempt to quit
smoking.
Despite these figures, LSA
senior Jonathan Kang said
he doesn't think the major-
ity of students comply with or
acknowledge the initiative.
"A lot of people haven't taken
into consideration that there's
a smoking ban," Kang said. "I
haven't really noticed a differ-

Kang, who started smoking

that he usually respects the no-

don't care.
"I think a lot of it's because

From Page 1
Monday morning, a day that the
players usually have off, to kick
off the biggest week of the year
with intensity.
The practice day seemed nec-
essary, though, as there's still a
laundry list of things Michigan
needs to address before Satur-
day.
There's the offensive line that
underwent its sixth personnel
change on Saturday. There's
Gardner who is not physically
able to make the electric plays
that were so common early in
the season. And above all, there
are the frequent negative play on
offense.
Hoke said all of that is man-
ageable - it just comes down to
consistency across the board.
The Wolverines have loved
the term "consistency" this sea-
son. It has become the go-to
buzzword, and the lack of it
has become the explanation for
offensive struggles.
But the question remains
whether or not consistency can
be coached. Week in and week
out, Hoke has started his press
conferences saying he's been
impressed with what he sees
in practice that given week,
yet game spasms still take over
when it actually counts.
According to the coaches and
players, part of that seems to be
not having all 11 players on the
field on the same page.
"No one's going to play a per-

feet game," said senior corner-
back Courtney Avery. "No one's
going to have a perfect practice.
In agame, hopefullyyou remem-
ber the mistakes that you made
and correct them. The key is to
get as many guys playing as hard
and as perfect as they can as pos-
sible."
It's no secret that the Wolver-
ines have had difficulty putting
points on the board through the
month of November, and with
Ohio State averaging 49 points a
game, it's questionable if Michi-
gan will have the offensive pro-
duction necessary to even keep
the game remotely close.
But Hoke isn't worried about
the point spread, or the fact that
the Buckeyes are two games
away from a second straight
undefeated season. In fact, spoil-
ing Ohio State's perfect record is
the last thing on any of the Wol-
verines' minds right now.
"We talk about ourselves and
what we have to do," Hoke said.
"We've never, ever mentioned it,
and I won't. That's not what it's
about. It's about us playing our
best football for our seniors and
the greatest rivalry in sport."
Hoke admitted that Ohio
State is the best team Michi-
gan will face all season. But he
stands by his statement from the
beginning of the season: that he
likes his team and that there are
still a few surprises.
"I'm very confident it could
happen, otherwise we wouldn't
play," Hoke said. "I'd called
down there to Columbus and say
we won't do it."

Thailand prime minister institutes
emergency law because of protests

Security act will
seal off roads,
impose curfiews
BANGKOK (AP) - Thailand's
prime minister invoked an emer-
gency law on Monday after dem-
onstrators seekingto remove her
from office occupied parts of the
finance and foreign ministries.
Prime Minister Yingluck Shi-
nawatra announced that the
Internal Security Act would
cover all of Bangkok and large
parts of surrounding areas.
Three especially sensitive dis-
tricts of the capital have been
under the law since August,
when there were early signs of
political unrest.
The law authorizes officials to
seal off roads, take action against
security threats, impose curfews
and ban the use of electronic
devices in designated areas.
Peaceful rallies are allowed
under the law.
Protesters swarmed into the
two government ministries earli-
er Monday, overrunning several
buildings and cutting electricity
in an escalating campaign to top-
ple Yingluck's government.
Protesters say they want Yin-
gluck to step down amid claims
that her government is con-
trolled by her brother, former
Prime Minister Thaksin Shi-
nawatra, who was ousted in a
military coup in 2006 for alleged
corruption. On Sunday, more

than 150,000 demonstrators
took to Bangkok's streets in the
largestcrally Thailand has seen in
years, uniting against what they
call the "Thaksin regime."
The incursions into the finance
and foreign ministries were the
boldest acts yet in opposition-led
protests that started last month.
They highlighted the movement's
new strategy of paralyzing the
government by forcing civil ser-
vants to stop working.
The opposition Democrat
Party, which is spearheading the
protests and has lost to Thaksin-
backed parties in every election
since 2001, also plans to chal-
lenge the government Tuesday
with a parliamentary no-confi-
dence debate.
"The protesters have escalat-
ed their rally, which previously
was a peaceful one," Yingluck
said in a televised address. She
said the government respect-
ed the people's right to freely
express opinions, but also had
the responsibility to safeguard
the country's peace and stability
and assets, along with the safety
of citizens and their right to
access government offices.
The law will cover the city's
international airports. In 2008,
anti-Thaksin demonstrators occu-
pied Bangkok's two airports for a
week after taking over the prime
minister's office for three months.

Ministry on a day when protesters
fanned out to 13 locations across

Bangkok, snarling traffic and rais-
ing concerns of violence in the
country's ongoing political crisis,
which has revolved around Thak-
sin for years.
"Go up to every floor, go into
every room, but do not destroy
anything," Suthep told the crowd
before he entered the ministry
and held a meeting in its confer-
ence room.
"Make them see this is peo-
ple's power!" said Suthep, a for-
mer deputy prime minister and
opposition lawmaker.
Protesters sang, danced and
blew noisy whistles in the hall-
ways as part of their "whistle-
blowing" campaign against the
government. One group cut
power at the Budget Bureau to
pressure the agencyto stop fund-
ing government projects.
Police made no immediate
move to oust them.
The protesters in the evening
burst onto the Foreign Ministry
grounds, which was not on their
original list of targets.
"The protesters are on the
ministry's compound but they
promised they will not enter
the buildings," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sek Wannamethee
said by phone. "We are now ask-
ing them to provide ways for the
officials who were still working
to leave the offices and they will
likely have to work from home
tomorrow." He did not know
how many protesters there were,
though Thai media said there
were several hundred.

Karzai won't to
sign pact, Rice says
refusal means 2014
withdrawl
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Afghanistan's president and the
U.S. delivered blunt messages
to each other Monday that gave
no indication of a resolution of
their disagreements over a pact
that governs the future of the
American troop presence in the
country.
Hamid Karzai said he won't
back down from his refusal to
sign during the rest of his term
in office, with National Security
Adviser Susan Rice responding
that this would mean the U.S.
would then start planning to
pull out all its forces after 2014.
Their meeting in Kabul came
the day after Karzai's surprise
decision to ignore Sunday's
recommendation by an Afghan
assembly of dignitaries to sign
the Bilateral Security Agree-
ment, a refusal that cast doubt
on whether American and
allied troops would remain in
Afghanistan to train Afghan
forces after most foreign troops
withdraw next year.
According to Karzai's office,
he told Rice during Monday's
meeting that he wouldn't back
down from that decision, defer-
ring it to whoever succeeds him
as president in April elections.
The White House said Rice
responded by telling Karzai that
the United States will plan to
pull all troops out of his country
after2014 if he doesn't promptly
sign.
It added that Rice told Karzai
that a signed agreement is nec-
essary to plan for thousands of
troops to stay in the country to
train and mentor Afghan secu-
rity forces to face the Taliban.
"President Karzai outlined
new conditions for signing the
agreement and indicated he is
not prepared to sign the BSA
promptly," the White House
said. "Without a prompt sig-
nature, the U.S. would have
no choice but to initiate plan-
ning for a post-2014 future
in which there would be no
U.S. or NATO troop presence
in Afghanistan," she told the
Afghan president.
Karzai announced his deci-
sion at a gathering of 2,500
tribal elders and regional lead-
ers known as a Loya Jirga, even
though the council not only
overwhelmingly approved the
deal after a four-day meeting
but urged him to sign it by Dec.
31.

Washington has asked him
to change his mind. But the
mercurial Karzai, in the meet-
ing with Rice, says he laid out a
series of new demands - albeit
ones mostly involving steps the
U.S. has already said it would
take.
One new demandwasthatthe
United States should address
a suggestion by the Loya Jirga
that all Afghan prisoners be
released from Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
According to the statement,
Karzai "said the United States
of America should respond to
the suggestion mentioned in the
resolution of the Loya Jirga to
free all the afghan prisoners in
Guantanamo."
There are nearly 20 Afghans
currently being held at the
American facility in Cuba.
Karzai's office said that in the
meetingwith Rice, he also asked
for further assurances from the
United States that its forces will
not raid Afghan homes and that
America express a sincere com-
mitment to help start stalled
peace talks with the Taliban.
He also reiterated his demand
that the United States commit
to holding free and transparent
elections on April 5.
The statement further added
that Karzai asked Rice to con-
vey his concerns about the raids
and peace talks to President
Barack Obama so that he can
"give assurances regarding the
issues to the Afghan people."
Obama has already addressed
the issue of raids in a letter to
Karzai last week that was read
to the assembly.
In it, Obama assured Karzai
that under the agreement, the
U.S. will continue to respect
"Afghan sovereignty." He also
said the U.S. military will not
conduct raids on homes except
under "extraordinary circum-
stances" involving urgent risks
to U.S. nationals.
The US has repeatedly urged
Karzai to sign a deal that would
allow about 8,000 American
troops to stay in the coun-
try beyond a 2014 withdrawal
deadline.
The two-term Afghan leader
has insisted that the winner of
an April 5 election to succeed
him should be the one to sign
the deal. More than $8 billion in
annual funds for Afghanistan's
fledgling security forces and
development assistance also are
at stake.
Karzai may be concerned
about his legacy, worried he
might be seen as responsible
for an agreement that some
Afghans will likely see as selling
out to foreign interests.

Universal security standards

n Nov. 1, two students at the University's chapter of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity house were stabbed while attempting
to remove patrons from the premises. Following the incident,
the security measures taken by fraternities for their parties have come
under scrutiny. While SAE's party wasn't sanctioned by the Interfra-
ternity Council, most fraternity events are required to be, which means
fraternities must follow strict guidelines and go through a brief security
session to ensure the safety of attendees. Although it's difficult to deter-
mine whether the incident at SAE could have been prevented at an IFC-
sanctioned party, an overhaul of the current fraternity security system
should be discussed, as well as University-provided security training for
all students, regardless of where they live.

Under IFC guidelines, fraternities are
required to have some members on guard -
called sober monitors - at each party, with
the number of them needed depending on
the size of the event. Each year of pledges
for each fraternity are trained to understand
the responsibilities of a sober monitor, which
include controlling who enters parties, help-
ing those who have fallen sick and keeping
the party itself under control. This training,
as well as abiding by IFC sanctions, is benefi-
cial for the fraternity. IFC-registered parties
are surveyed twice a night and sober moni-
tors are tested to ensure sobriety.
However, the system is not without its
flaws. The training is not entirely comprehen-
sive - only a single, one-to-three-hour lesson
is required. There is also a general lack of uni-
formity between the training of fraternities
and sororities, as some sororities are required
to take GreekLifeEdu - an alcohol education
course designed for Greek Life members -
while fraternities are not. In order to improve
this system, both pledges and brothers should
take refresher courses on sober monitor
training at least once a year to ensure party
security remains up to the latest standards.

On a larger scale, the University should
consider implementing similar training for
all students. The University has acknowl-
edged the realities of student life outside of
campus with its Stay in the Blue program, so
expanding the program to training shouldn't
be out of the realm of possibilities. Most of
campus is outside of the jurisdiction of the
IFC, so the current lack of training creates an
unnecessarily dangerous environment. The
University has a history of distancing itself
from fraternities that violate sanctions, but
administration must both come to terms with
the fact that students are involved with these
organizations and embrace an opportunity to
improve safety across campus.
The IFC sanctions offer the best model to
ensure fraternity safety. But its flaws in mini-
mal training for sober monitors coupled with
the lack of alcohol education across Greek life
are concerning. While the University should
acknowledge the independence of the IFC,
it should also begin working on a program to
increase party safety for all students - Greek-
Life-affiliated or not. Maintaining the safety
of its students should be a top priority for the
University, even if the events occur off-campus.

again, as I reached out and tried
to fill this void. I was lucky to find
people willing to teach me.
In high school I was exposed to
a network of incredible African-
American men any person should
be honored to meet. Chief among
these is Trevor Coleman, the author
and chief speechwriter for former
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
He was a close friend of my father
and has become like a second dad
to me. Mr. Coleman introduced me
briefly to people such as Judges Eric
Clay, Damon Keith and Ted Shaw,
who's a Law School professor and
the former NAACP Legal Defense
Fund director.
In college I've been able to work
under incredible professors, such
as Matthew Countryman and Har-
wood McClerking, while being
mentored at the ACLU by attorney
Mark Fancher. While some of these
men have played far more signifi-

'But you're smart'

The #BBUM campaign's intention was to
spark discussion about the lack of diversity
on the University's campus. The campaign
has caught national interest and has become
a huge trend on Twitter. This was a catalyst
for the much-needed discussions of the unful-
filled promise of higher enrollment rates for
minority students and the fact that the Uni-
versity promotes tolerance but not acceptance
of the different racial, ethnic and religious
groups that inhabit this campus.
I wanted to take advantage of this oppor-
tunity to speak about my experiences as a bi-
racial woman at the University.
I often joke that I'm racially ambiguous and
will change races depending on how someone
will classify me. Though it makes me and other
people laugh, it covers up the actual discom-
fort I feel. I identify as bi-racial - half White
and half Black - but I'm not always seen as
how I identify.
Perhaps my very light complexion gives a
twist to people's preconceived notions of how
a bi-racial woman should look. Depending on
whom you ask, Ihave been classified as Puerto
Rican, White, from "some" island, and when
people are completely unsure they will say,
"you're something, right?"
These racial and ethnic classifications come
from some small-binding stereotype. For
example, my very curly hair gives some type
of indication that I may be a minority, and it's
furthered when some hear that I use slang that
doesn't fit in with mainstream white vernacu-
lar. Once it's confirmed that I'm bi-racial, peo-
ple will say, "that makes sense," "I could tell
by the way you spoke," "your hair is different"
and many other variations. Then the annoying
questions come: "Can you wash your hair?"
"Why do you speak Black?" "Which parent is
Black?" "Do you sometimes get confused on
how you should act?"
Before I understood the complexity of the
ignorance surrounding race, I would become

furious and defensive when asked these idiotic
questions. What the hell do you mean, can I
wash my hair? Can you wash your hair? Why
do I speak Black? I was unaware that Black
was a language - please educate me. These
experiences are a small sliver of the amount
of ignorance and racism that my counterparts
in the Black community, and other minority
groups, face on a day-to-day basis.
Amomentthatstandsoutinmymemorywas
during my freshman year in one of the Modern
Language Building's infamous 300-person
lectures. I had a discussion regarding race
with a gentleman that sat next to me. I men-
tioned that I was bi-racial and the expres-
sion on his face changed from a smile to one
of confusion. I was expecting this. But what
I wasn't expecting was his response: "But
you're smart?" Those three words will forever
be ingrained in my mind. Perhaps he thought
it was a compliment - I'm not sure. What I'm
sure of is that the stereotypes that we may
have thought were long gone with slavery and
Jim Crow still exist. Needless to say, I stopped
sitting next to him after that.
The purpose of this reflection was to bring
more awareness of the inequalities that minor-
ities in race, religion, culture and other social
identities that do not fit white culture face.
However, this discussion shouldn't be limited
to just the Black community but should be a
catalyst for improving how we look at and dis-
cuss diversity. We are doing a disservice to our
peers and ourselves by not speaking out about
the oppressive cloud that constantly rains over
minority students.
If everything else that I have written is for-
gotten, I hope to leave this message: This is
not just a Black problem. This is a community
problem that affects far more than the naked
eye can see. Things can be done and they will
be done, butonly if people are open and willing.

ast Thursday, University
Housing announced a new
meal-plan structure for
students liv-
ing in residence
halls. Starting in
2014, all student
meal plans will
include unlim-
ited meals. This
is a change from
previous years HARSHA
in which plans NAHATA
were separated
into blocks of
125,150, 200 and
unlimited meals. Additionally, these
plans included significant amounts
of Dining Dollars and Blue Bucks:
The 125 meal plan, for example,
came with 300 Dining Dollars and
75 Blue Bucks. The new plans don't
include Blue Bucks and only include
25 Dining Dollars, a significant
change from previous years. The
policy also changes the way guest
meals are distributed, allowing stu-
dents only two guest meal swipes.
According to a University Hous-
ing official, the new plan was
discussed at length and chosen
to create a sense of community
through dining halls. Christine
Siegel, senior associate director of
housing services, wrote in an e-mail
to The Michigan Daily: "We want
students to feel comfortable that
they can eat as often as they like in
the dining hall. We are hoping that
the plans will encourage students
to use our dining facilities as hubs
for socializing and studying."

One Direction loses
momentum with
third album
ByADAM THEISEN
DailyArts Writer
If One Direction's first two
records are any indication, Mid-
night Memories is set to be one
of 2013's best-
selling CDs. D
It's hard, if not
impossible, Midnight
to imagine an Memories
album that
could be less One Direction
deserving of
that title. Even Columbia
just approach-
ing Midnight
Memories as typical boy-band stuff
leads to disappointment.
Back in 2011, One Direction
struck pop-music gold with its
debut single, the energetic ear-
worm that was "What Makes
You Beautiful." You'd hope that
at least a little bit of the spirit
behind that song would still be
present on the tracks of Mid-
night Memories, but no, every
idea here is botched, every sign
of potential immediately thrown
away and every band member
whitewashed until they lose
all charisma and uniqueness.
The lyrics and voices are inex-
plicably put at the forefront of
the mix, even though they're so
banal and generic that they're
impossible to recall by the time
each track ends.
Midnight Memories is most
attention-grabbing when you're
just trying to spot all of the

songs that One Direction and
its songwriters are "borrowing"
from. The album unnecessar-
ily opens with a copy of the first
30 seconds of The Who's "Baba
O'Riley," despite it having no
relation to the actual first song.
Elsewhere, "Diana" bastard-
izes the vibe of the Footloose
soundtrack, "Midnight Memo-
ries" steals from Joan Jett's "I
Love Rock 'n' Roll" and "Does
He Know" takes from "Jessie's
Girl," among countless oth-
ers. The "Friday Night Lights"
theme song can't even escape
thievery here. The songwriters
can't be bothered to be original
in the songs' titles, either. Come
on, guys - "You and I" was a
Lady Gaga hit just two years ago.
Keeping with the theme of
re-appropriating other artists'
styles (because, let's be honest,
Midnight Memories does noth-
ing original of note), the album's
most interesting theme is One
Direction's marketing team
trying to subtly reposition the
group alongside mainstream
folk-rock revivalists like Mum-
ford & Sons and The Lumineers.
Songs like "Through the Dark"
has whoever is singing (it's seri-
ously impossible to tell - they all
sound like a young Rob Thomas)
doing his best Marcus Mumford
impression as bass drums drive
the song and the producers try
to evoke a campfire atmosphere.
It's reminiscent of when U.S.
record executives changed The
Beatles' Rubber Soul to better
position it among the burgeon-
ing folk scene of the mid-1960s.
The only difference is that Rub-
ber Soul was, you know, a little
bit better. The makers of this

album don't seem to realize that
adding a One Direction dance-
tint to folk makes it less palat-
able, not more interesting.
Considering the resources at
the group's disposal, it's really
surprising how terribly execut-
ed Midnight Memories is. Surely
the band could've hired better
songwriters than the ones fea-
tured on this record, and even
the producers don't seem to
know what they're doing. The
record's artificial and overdone
style is the musical equivalent
of putting a poem through five
different languages in Google
Translate and then seeing what
it looks like again in its original
tongue.
When Midnight Memories
isn't bland, it's simply frustrating.
Verses with potential give way to
poorly written, boring choruses.
There's no spontaneity and no
energy, which is a damning offense
for a pop album that needs to be
constantly holding your attention.
The few "highlights" are the opti-
mistic cheesiness of "Don't Forget
Where You Belong" and the best
track, "Little Black Dress," whose
relatively rough guitars make it
sound like a lost Big Star cut from
the 1970s. However, these songs
are nowhere near enough to save
an album that is destined to be
played on repeat in your local Toys
'R' Us during the holiday season
before quickly being forgotten
altogether. Whether it's puzzling
evidence that record companies
think kids will buy anything,
regardless of quality, or simply
a mess of a CD from an already-
past-its-prime boy band, Midnight
Memories is sub-par and certainly
not worth your money.

Ihave a confession to make,
something that could
affect your perception of
me as the writer you're cur-
rently reading. It's the type of
revelation
that I usu-
ally wouldn't
even bother
marking
down, but it
has gotten
to the point
where the ELLIOT
truth needs ALPERN
to be heard.
Ready?
Wait - first, actually, it's
important to give you a little
context before my admission
will make sense. Regarding my
own ability to write, I'm actu-
ally pursuing a sub-concentra-
tion in Creative Writing here,
specializing in fiction. All of
this is to say I take what I pen
down quite seriously. So it's
tough to divulge something I
consider (perhaps erroneously)
to be a flaw in my technique as
a writer.
Put simply: I need outside
help when I write. Sitting down
to a blank page - and it pains
me to say this - is too difficult,
sometimes. Occasionally, I go
through the motions; I toss
a few throwaway sentences
down to see how they break up
the white space. But, sooner or
later, I always seem to return,
begging for a chance - just a
chance!
To confess more specifically:
I tend to turn to music when
nothing else will get me going.
It's easy to overlook the
implications of that. After all,
who doesn't play a little The
xx when that homework gets
to be a slog? How could I be
blamed when I just want a
little flavor to build my recipe
around?
Unfortunately, it's not as
simple as that. Each master
author these days seems to sell
the same advice like it's going
out of style: In a world where
the Internet is suffocating

Five
Things:
Puerto
RiCo
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
1. Nik Stauskas is this team's only
consistent offensive threat right
now.
This is an easy one to see. After
averaging a tournament-high 23.3
points per game, leading to atour-
nament MVP honor, it's clear that
Michigan is relying on the sopho-
more guard alot.
The first glimpse was seen
Thursday, when Stauskas scored
24 points on 7-for-10 shooting.
The trend carried over to Friday,
when Michigan (4-2) trailed by as
many 16 in the second half against
Florida State.
Despite a cold first half in
which he scored just three points,
Stauskas was central to Michi-
gan's dramatic comeback, pouring
in 16 in the second half and seven
more in overtime.
And it wasn't even from jump
shots - he drove to the basket, he
drew fouls and he attempted nine
free throws in the game.
Michigan coach John Beilein
has said that with Stauskas's
added weight and strength, he
wants him to draw more fouls and
take more contact as he puts the
ball on the ground.
The issue is that he can't do it
all. And while it's unfair to say
that no one else is contributing
for the Wolverines, it is fair to say
that no one is playing on the level
of Stauskas.
Looking down the road, the
team as a whole will need to
raise its level of play. Especially
if Stauskas's ankle injury - he
appeared to twist it, though he
did stay in the game - proves to
be more serious than originally
thought.
2. Glenn Robinson 111 needs to
demand the ball more.

Wolverines
ink top-20
recruiting class

PATRICKBARRON/Daily
Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas earned tournament MVP honors, even though Michigan lost in the finals to Charlotte.

This year was supposed to be
different for the sophomore for-
ward after he averaged 11.0 points
on just 7.5 shots per game while
playing third - if not fourth - fid-
dle on last year's squad. This year,
as captain of the team, Robinson
was expected to be more of avocal
and scoringleader.
But up to this point, the expec-
tations have not materialized.
Sure, he is averaging 11.8 points,
but he's only taking 1.7 shots more
per game compared to last season.
And upon further analysis of the
numbers, we see that he's averag-
ing 1.5 more 3-point attempts a
game.
Yes, the sample size is small,
but for a player that decided to
stay another year after flirting
with leaving forthe NBA Draft, he
needs to be doing more on offense.
He's still deferring on open
looks and not showing the aggres-
siveness he should as the No.1 or 2
option for Michigan.
Robinson still averaged 10.3
points in the tournament and that
would have been higher if not for
the hard foul he took on his back
on Sunday that limited him to nine
minutes and four points. Clearly
he's still making an impact.
But the back injury could hin-
der Robinson's assertiveness.
Michigan coach John Beilein said
in his postgame press conference
Sunday that the team was follow-
ing trainers' advice to keep him
moving. The forward did start
the second half before coming out
after three minutes because he
didn't feel comfortable.

If the injury becomes more
serious, Robinson will lose pre-
cious time to define the role he
will play this season before Big
Ten play starts.
3. Mitch McGary will only get bet-
ter as the season goes on.
The sophomore forward didn't
start any games in the tourna-
ment, but when he did enter, his
presence was felt immediately.
Playing in just his second, third
and fourth games of the season,
McGary looked every bit like the
All-American he was picked in
the preseason to be. After play-
ing just 14 minutes in Michigan's
win against Long Beach State
on Thursday, McGary played 33
on Friday as he battled against
a tough front line from Florida
State.
Knocking down bodies, mak-
ing outlet passes and dribbling
the ball in transition, the forward
looked in mid-season form in
Michigan's win.
Against Florida State, McGary
attempted 15 shots, well above his
average of 5.7 last year.
Going forward, Michigan will
need to run more of its offense
through McGary to establish
more of an inside game. In the
tournament, Michigan attempted
77 3-pointers - 10 more than the
next team, Virginia Common-
wealth. The Wolverines also made
the most 3-pointers, and finished
with the second-most points in
the tournament. But going for-
ward, Michigan needs to rely less
on the long ball and design more

plays for McGary at the hoop for
success.
McGary aside, both of Michi-
gan's other big men - redshirt
junior forward Jon Horford and
fifth-year senior forward Jordan
Morgan - played well in limited
minutes.
Morgan looked especially
good on Sunday, snagging nine
rebounds - five on the offensive
end - in 13 minutes.
"Jordan Morgan went in there
and played his tail off," Beilein
said. "He had five offensive
rebounds, he worked so hard. He
had a big bucket for us and two
huge foul shots. I'm really happy
for him because finding play-
ing time with Mitch in there is
tough."
While it remains to be seen
how much Morgan will play going
forward, it's promising to see him
play well while McGary works his
way back to full health.
4. Zak Irvin isn't afraid to shoot,
and he shouldn't be.
Against Charlotte on Sunday,
Michigan shot 8-for-34 in the first
half. Nothing was falling for the
Wolverines, who essentially live
and die with the jump shot.
With sophomore guard Caris
LeVert - Michigan's surprising
second-leading scorer - on the
bench with two early fouls, the
Wolverines had to rely on fresh-
man guard Zak Irvin to score.
And he tried to fill the void as
best he could, attempting nine
first-half shots. But only one
would fall, a 3-pointer with less
than 20 seconds that cut Michi-
gan's deficit to two. While it was
his first make, it was encouraging
to see him trust his shot.
Coming off the bench, Irvin's
role is to be a shooter. At 6-foot-6,
the swingman should be looking
to bea sparkplug, especially when
the offense becomes stagnant.
In Michigan's first two games
in Puerto Rico, there were times
when Irvin took shots early in
the shot clock that weren't neces-
sary. But in those moments, Irvin
wasn't seen as one of the go-to
options on the floor. That's why
those shots looked bad.
On Sunday, with LeVert out and
Robinson out in the second half,
it was appropriate for Irvin to
attempt 14 shots, even if he missed
11 ofthem.
"We had pretty good looks,"
Beilein said. "Unfortunately,
many of them were Zak Irvin's
looks and you know he's a heck
of a shooter. So he's going to have
nights like that, and we'll tell him
to keep shooting."
5. Bold Prediction: Stauskas will
average 20 points in non-confer-
ence games.
Stauskas averaged 39.3 minutes
in the tournament, and while that
number will drop off with some
cupcake games on Michigan's
schedule, his scoring won't.
At the moment and for the
foreseeable future, Stauskas will
remain the Wolverines' No.1 scor-
ing option.
With an expanded game, Staus-
kas needstobe on the floor, espe-
cially for ateam that loves to drive
and kick the ball out for three.
He went 8-for-19 in the tourna-

ment from deep and with McGary
back in the middle for the Wolver-
ines, more fast breaks and outlets
will result.
Yes, the guard could struggle
against Duke and Arizona, but
you know full well that he, along
with the rest of team, will be up
for those games.
With Trey Burke and Tim
Hardaway gone, the ball runs
through Stauskas. Until another
player steps, that will remain the

game. After NOTEBOOK
starting the
season 1-2, the Wolverines
have jumped out to a 4-2 record
thanks in large part to their
offensive production.
Sparked by junior trans-
fer guard Shannon Smith's 32
points against Detroit Mercy
on Nov. 16, Michigan's offense
has been red hot the past three
games. Freshman point guard

career-high 22 points against
Pittsburgh on Wednesday.

ever-consistent junior forward
Nicole Elmblad. The captain
is averaging 12.8 points and 10
rebounds per game and leads
the team with almost 39 min-
utes per game. Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico has often
cited Elmblad as the hardest-
working player in practice, so it
comes as no surprise that she's
productive every night on the
floor. Her success was recog-
nized on Monday when she was
named to the Big Ten Player of
the Week Honor Roll for her
performance last week.
But recently, it has been a
true team effort for Michigan,
which has found multiple scor-
ing outlets throughout its line-
up.
The Wolverines have show-
cased their ability to put points
on the board, having scored at
least 70 points in five straight
games, twice hitting 80. And
against the Panthers, Michigan
shot above 50 percent from the
field for the first time this sea-
son.

just an exceptional talent."
Guard/forward Maria Back-

Dunston, forward Emoni Jack-
son and center Terra Stapleton
round out the class.
"This class has the potential
to be a special class, a group
that makes a great impact on
our program," Barnes Arico
said.
EYEING THE COMPETITION:
After playing three games in
five days, the Wolverines had
an eight-day break. Next up for
Michigan is the Barclays Invita-
tional in Brooklyn, N.Y., where
Michigan will face Texas Tech
on Friday and either LSU or
Rutgers on Saturday.
With the Scarlet Knights
joining the Big Ten next sea-
son, this is an early chance for
the Wolverines to get a look at
a future conference opponent.
But before that, they will meet
the Red Raiders.
Texas Tech (3-1) sports three
players who average double fig-
ures - one fewer than Michi-
gan. But like the Wolverines,
the Red Raiders have a fairly
small starting lineup, with both
teams averaging 42.5 rebounds
per game.

Prospects Nation ranks the
class No. 20 in the country.
"I'm super, super excited
about the (five) young ladies
that signed with us today,"
Barnes Arico said. "I think it's
a tremendous class, and we
really were allowed to get a lot
of needs. (They) are super bas-
ketball players as well as great
students and great people from
terrific families."
Leading the class is the
nation's ninth-ranked pros-
pect: Katelynn Flaherty, a point
guard from Townson, N.J. As a
junior, she averaged 30.3 points,
5.8 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 3.5

Tuesday, November 26, 2013 - 7

PAUL SHERMAN/Da
Redshirt freshman Kyle Kalis began the season as the starter at right guard. After a benching and several moves on the offensive line, Kalis started again against Iowa. He is listed atop the depth chart this week for the game against Ohio State.
Offensive line carousel goes for another spin

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
This year, the situation on the
interior of Michigan's offensive
line has can be likened to a hor-
rific game of musical chairs. And
each time the music stops and
the whistle blows, the result is
usually a sack of redshirt junior
quarterback
Devin Gardner. NOTEBOOK
Or a rush for
negative two yards.
The situation began with
redshirt sophomores Graham
Glasgow along with redshirt
freshman Kyle Kalis. Miller was
the first to go, replaced by red-
shirt sophomore Chris Bryant.
Then Bryant and Kalis were
replaced by redshirt junior Joey
Burzynski and redshirt fresh-
man Erik Magnuson. Freshman
Kyle Bosch filled in for Burzyn-
ski after he was injured.
The combination of Glasgow,
Magnuson and Bosch lasted for

a while. But last Saturday, Kalis
got back in on the action, replac-
ing Bosch.
It's enough to make your head
spin, but after all of the switch-
ing and swapping, four of the five
opening-game starters are at the
head of the depth chart in the
last week of the regular season.
After Saturday's game, Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke declined
to discuss Kalis's play until he
could watch the game tape.
On Saturday, Hoke said
Kalis won back the starting job
because "he earned it."
"It's really no bigger decision
than that," Hoke said. "He had
earned it. He had done a good job
in the week. They evaluated him.
Thought it would be good for the
other Kyle, for Bosch, to take a
step back and watch a little bit
and keep learning. And I think
that's what Kalis did."
With the new line combina-
tion, Michigan allowed only one
sack after surrendering a com-

bined 19 in the previous three
games. Still, Iowa does not rush
the passer aggressively, and the
rushing game grinded its way to
just 60 yards on 29 carries.

According to Ben Axelrod of

Ryan Shazier poked fun at the
Michigan offense Monday.
"I know they've probably

That's either some mild trash
talking or just a mild overstate-
ment. Michigan has given up
107 negative plays this season,
according to Big Ten reporter
John U. Bacon. That should be
welcome news for Shazier, who
leads the team in both tackles
(108) and tackles for loss (19.5).
Later, safety Christian Bry-
ant tweeted a photo of himself

saying, "All I can think about is

them to leave the game in the
first half. After the game, Gard-
ner also appeared to be nursing
a shoulder injury. He hooked his
finger in his belt loop during his
postgame press conference to
support his right arm.
"They're all going to be fine,"
Hoke said. "All three of them."
On whether he expects them

"Oh yeah."

FOOTBALL RECRUTIN
OT Erik Swenson
commits to Michigan

Wolverines find
offensive groove

2016 commit
is 6-foot-7, 290
pounds and labeled
a top prospect
By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan has lost three of its
past four games to Big Ten teams
and is a 12.5-point underdog
against Ohio State on Saturday.
But on Monday the Wolver-
ines won a battle on the recruit-
ing trail, snagging2016 offensive
tackle Erik Swenson from Down-
ers Grove, Ill.
Swenson (6-foot-7, 290
pounds) is not yet rated in the
class of 2016, but experts label
him as a top offensive line pros-
pect.
Swenson started as a fresh-
man and sophomore at left tackle
at Downers Grove South, which
went 6-4 this season and lost to
Naperville Central in the first
round of the Division 8A play-
offs, 36-0.
. Swenson said he committed
so early because he has always
wanted to go to Michigan and
didn't feel the need to prolong
the decision.
"Erik is just a pretty simple
kind of kid," said Swenson's
s father, Swen. "He's not into trav-
eling across the country and
doesn't want to take official vis-
its and waste people's time and
money. He truly had no desire to
go anywhere else. He loves the
school, the tradition and every-

thing that is Michigan. He will
get a great education and will get
a chance to play at a high level."
Swenson made an unofficial
visit to Michigan for the Notre
Dame night game on Sept. 7 and
will visit again this weekend for
the Ohio State game. He also
attended camps at Michigan the
past two summers.
Along with Michigan, Swen-
son held offers from Ohio State,
Notre Dame, Northwestern and
Illinois.
Illinois was the first school to
offer Swenson on Dec. 7, 2012.
Ohio State followed on May 10,
with Michigan coming 12 days
later.
Northwestern offered him a
scholarship on June 7 at a camp,
and he came to Michigan's camp
on June 16.
Along with 134 years of tradi-
tion, Swenson cited the caliber
of Michigan's coaches and their
leadership styles at the camps he
attended as major factors in his
decision.
In Chicago, a solid Michigan
recruiting location, Swenson is
familiar not only with the coach-
es, but also with some players,
including freshman guard Kyle
Bosch. Bosch is from St. Fran-
cis, Ill., 25 miles from Downers
Grove.
From the current roster,
freshmen linemen Kyle Kalis,
Erik Magnuson, Kyle Bosch and
Ben Braden will be seniors when
Swenson arrives in 2016. Four-
star offensive tackles Juwan
Bushell-Beatty and Mason Cole
have also committed for the class
of 2014.

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
Last week was a particularly
special one for the No. 3 Michi-
gan hockey team.
Friday, the Wolverines finally
found an offensive surge in a 6-0
rout of Niagara. Most impor-
tantly, players who have been
looking to get on the score sheet
for much of the season were able
to do so, including freshman for-
ward Alex Kile, who scored the
first goal of his Michigan career.
"There's a little more confi-
dence, absolutely," said Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson.
"Anytime a kid scores his first
goal, it's going to jump-start
his confidence. You saw that
with JT Compher and hopefully
you'll see that with Alex Kile
now."
Until Friday, even freshman
forward Tyler Motte - who's
been one of the most produc-
tive freshmen this season with
five goals and two assists - had
been held without a goal since
Oct. 25. Motte netted a goal just
34 seconds in, which was the
fastest goal he could remember
scoring dating back to his youth
hockey days.
Completing the trend of Fri-
day's accomplishments by the
freshmen class, goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort picked up the first
shutout for any Wolverine goal-
tender this season.
GUPTILL'S NEW GROOVE:
Junior forward Alex Guptill was
able to find the back of the net
twice on Friday - once when he

found himself wide open in the
slot and again after spinning off
a defenseman and scoring from
an awkward angle.
Guptill has been in a bit of a
slump this season after leading
Michigan in scoring during last
year's campaign. He doubled
his season total for goals on Fri-
day with two tallies, giving him
eight points on the year - good
for fifth on the team.
Friday was one of Guptill's
better games thus far, and it
isn't just because his name stood
out in the box score. Guptill
simplified things for himself.
He played deep in the offensive
zone and exhibited patience to
put his potent goal-scoring abili-
ties to good use.
"Not much went for him, but
it was good that he stuck with
it," Berenson said. "And then
finally in the third period the
puck went in for him. Up until
then, it was a lot of hard work
but no results. But I think we're
getting him back onto his game."
THANKFUL FOR HOCKEY:
While most of the country will
be rushing to put a turkey in the
oven on Thursday morning, the
Wolverines will be on the ice
practicing. For the players that
live near Ann Arbor, most will
be lucky enough to make it home
for a mid-afternoon dinner with
their families.
But for the players not stay-
ing, senior captain Mac Bennett
isn't worried that they'll miss
out on a quality meal. He says
there are plenty of good cooks
on the team, and anyone who

JAMES COLLER/Daily
Junior forward Alex Guptill scored twice Friday to break out of a scoring slump.

lives too far away to travel back
home will be enjoying a hockey
Thanksgiving at Bennett's house
with Derek DeBlois, Adam Jane-
cyk and Mike Chiasson.
"It's Thanksgiving, man,"
Bennett said. "We'll probably
just make a ton of food, and
whoever shows up shows up.
There definitely won't be any-
one who doesn't have anywhere
to go."
Bennett thought long and
hard before admitting the
sophomore class probably has
the best chefs on the team. He

mentioned that DeBlois's break-
fast lineup isn't anything totake
for granted, though. It's too bad
that eggs, hash browns and pan-
cakes aren't a staple on Thanks-
giving menus.
To be fair, Bennett said the
Thanksgiving spread might be
light with the Big Ten opener
against Ohio State looming the
next day at 7 p.m. However,
there was no hesitation when
Bennett mentioned stuffing his
face with turkey and taking a
nap as being among his favorite
holiday traditions.

It seemed like yet another Friday night game
under the lights. Yet another quarterback takingthe
field looking to lead his troops and leave a legacy. Yet
another star in the making.
For Wilton Speight, the night started out ordi-
nary. But at night's end, when the team left the field,
the fans emptied the bleachers and the Friday night
lights shut off, Speight's future as a football player
seemed anything but certain.
It was Sept. 9, 2011 and the junior quarterback was
opening Richmond, Va.'s Collegiate High School's
football season with a matchup against Trinity Epis-
copal in front of a home crowd.
On a drive in the middle of the game, Speight led
the Cougars down the field with ease. A quick run-
option play had Speight heading for the end zone.
Quickly, allthat stood between Speightand six points
was a Trinity safety, but Speight paid him little mind.
As he reached for the right pylon, he collided with
the safety, landing on his elbow to brace the fall.
With all eyes on him, the junior jumped up after
the touchdown - and the collision - celebrating as
he made hisoway tothe Collegiate sideline, amid deaf-
ening cheers from the home crowd.
Thriving on adrenaline, Speight had to wait for
the trainer to check him out on the sideline before he
knew anything was wrong. The trainer quickly felt
three breaks underneath his shoulder pads, and the
diagnosis was clear - a broken right collarbone, his
throwing arm.
"I definitely knew he was done after that," said
Collegiate coach Mark Palyo.
Collarbone injuries are common in football. But
Speight's required a metal rod and eight screws to
be inserted. He had the surgery almost immediately
after the game.
"The recovery (with the rod), the way I've seen
it, is a faster way than on its own, and that's why he
had it put in," Palyo said. "And of course it takes some
time to come back, but amazingly he was back on the
field in 22 or 23 days after the surgery doing light arm
motions and lighttosses."
The Cougars ended the season 2-6 without the
guidance of their quarterback. But despite the quick
recovery, Speight had essentially missed his entire
junior season - the most important year for an aspir-

salvage his future playing career.
In 2011, going into his junior season, Speight was
a highly regarded recruit. Though he had yet to com-
mit to a school, for the Virginia native, all signs point-
ed to Virginia Tech.
Following the injury, though, the Hokies with-
drew their offer, leaving Speight with little choice
on how to resurrect his career. Speight decided to
reclassify and repeat his junior year at Collegiate.
"A lot went into the decision," Speight said. "A lot
of conversations with my friends, my family and the
school. It was a tough decision, especially seeing all
my buddies go off to college early, but last season, my
second junior year, was really good."
"Really good," is an understatement. During his
second junior season, Speight exploded for 2,900
yards and 32 touchdown, and he rushed for six more
- all in just 10 games. And despite an early exit from
the state playoffs, Speight's season launched him
back into the national spotlight and onto Michigan's
radar.
Following the 2012 season, Speight had multiple
offers - suitors coming in from North Carolina State
and Miami. He chose to commit to the Wolverines on
Feb. 6, 2013, signing day for the 2013 class.
Since signing with Michigan, Speight has shot up
the recruiting rankings. He's now considered a three
and four-star recruit from multiple sources. ESPN
currently ranks the quarterback as the sixth best at
his position, while Rivals and Scout rank him the
16th and 21st quarterback, respectively.
As a player, Speight has everything a team looks
for in a quarterback. At 6-foot-6, 230 pounds, he is
blessed with size. He's a pro-style player with strong
pocket presence and a cannon of an arm. Speight has
also shown flashes of mobility
and an ability to make throws
outside of the pocket.
"I have been with Wilton "(Drake
for five years, and I can still
remember his very first year and I a
when we had to pull him up to excitedt
the varsity team (because) we
had a need for a backup quar-
terback," Palyo said. "In our
very first scrimmage, which
was against a really good public
school team, I had to put him in
because our first string quarterback got hurt a little
bit.
"One of the first things that really stood out to me
was his pocket poise and presence. For such a young
person to get thrown in against a really good oppo-
nent, he actually showed great composure in the
pocket at a very early point."
Above all else, though, Speight has a cerebral game
that onlythe best players in the sport can add.
"One thing I've done with him that I haven't done
with any other quarterback (is) I will turn it over to
him, and he knows," Palyo said. "We just have a little
hand signal, and I let him make the call according to
what he has seen on the field. He understands those
aspects of the game."
Considering Seattle Seahawks quarterback Rus-
sell Wilson attended Collegiate and played under
Palyo, his praises for Wilton can't be brushed off as
pretentious.
Speight's early ability to audible notoonly illustrates
his complex understanding of the game, but also his
leadership in the huddle and the locker room. He's

also shown early signs of leadership at the collegiate
level, having reached out to many of his future team-
mates and taking part in linebacker commit Michael
Fern's Project 135. Fern's project has been a way to
promote Michigan to fellow recruits and help spread
the Wolverine brand.
"I think the most important thingthat we did was
to communicate with recruits and do our best to
build up a relationship so that they feel comfortable,"
Speight said of the project.

unning. Among those early rela-
tionships he's already made,
Speight has grown close with
four-star wide receiver Drake
Harris. The two will be roommates in the spring and
have already put in some early work together at the
Elite 11 weekend in California this past spring.
"I'd say I'm probably closest with (Harris) because
we're just excited that we get to learn together and,
hopefully, do incredible things on the field," Speight
said. "He and I are just excited to hit the ground run-
ning."
But when Speight arrives on campus, the quarter-
back picture will look murky. Behind redshirt junior
Devin Gardner, the team also has redshirt sopho-
more Russell Bellomy and freshman Shane Morris.
While Bellomy has never been viewed as a viable
long-term option, Morris was brought in to assume
the role in future seasons. When he was initially
recruited, Morris was one of the top quarterbacks in
the country, but a case of mononucleosis during his
senior year of high school dropped him from a five-
star recruit to a four.
But Speight's addition to the equation should make
the quarterback competition fierce and entertaining
in the near future.

Since his injury, Speight has appreciated football
in a new way.
"He doesn't take anything for granted because it
could be that one simple play that wasn't that big of
a play that could change everything," Palyn said. "It
makes him realize anything can change. It can be
that one play, so since then he has been very diligent
in his work to be prepared both mentally and physi-
cally."
Having watched Speight develop for the last five
years, Palyo knows Michigan is getting a special
player.
"They're going to find a young man who's pas-
sionate about football," he said. "A young man who
is open and willing to be coached and (willing) to lis-
ten and to learn. He's always looking to learn to try
to understand the field better and better his vision
in the pocket. Wilton is definitely going to bring that
with him."
At the time of Speight's injury, he never imagined
re-classing would lead to a turf field emblazioned
with a block 'M' and a winged helmet. But one thing
Speight has learned in his four and a half years in
high school is that plans change, and you haveto take
obstacles as they come.
"I would never have been able to do any of this
without my family's support," Speight said. "They've
always been supportive in whatever I want to do,
and they're behind me 100 percent. I'm where I am
because of them."
While his parents' eyes will always stay focused on
him, new sets of eyes will be cast on Speight when he
arrives at Michigan.
Ones from coaches. Ones from teammates. And if
things go as planned for Speight, over 100,000 sets of
eyes when he takes the field at Michigan Stadium as
the starting quarterback for the Wolverines.

"Everyone including Shane and myself (are) going
to be in an intense competition for years to come,"
Speight said. "But when I agreed to playat Michigan,
I agreed not (to) shy away from competition. We have
to embrace it, and I'm looking forward to the future."
