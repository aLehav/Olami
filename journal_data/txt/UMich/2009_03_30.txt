A NEW MODEL FOR TEACHING BUSINESS
Ross ethinks finance studies

Industry woes haven't
hurt student interest
in field, officials say
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Despite the nation's econom-
ic meltdown, driven primarily
through the collapse of Wall Street
and the suffering of large financial
institutions, officials at the Ross
School of Business report that the
decreased availability of jobs in
finance hasn't soured students'

interest in entering the field.
To meet this continuing demand
from students, Business adminis-
trators said they are restructuring
the Bachelor in Business Adminis-
tration Finance curriculum for the
upcoming academic year by alter-
ing existing classes and adding four
new courses.
"Very close to 60 percent of our
students are interested in finance
careers so we wanted to take a good
look at the curriculum," Business
School Prof. and Finance Depart-
ment Chair M.P. Narayanan said.
Narayanan said though the field
of finance has suffered of late, he

hasn't seen a related dip in enroll-
ment in finance classes for this
upcoming fall.
The new finance program will
feature an increase in action-based
learning, Narayanan said, which
will give students the chance to
use real money and information to
start and manage their own hedge
funds.
Additionally, the 2009 curricu-
lum will allow for more specialized
interests within the finance field.
Narayanan said the four new
courses will educate students in
financial trading, the macroeco-
nomics of capital markets, alterna-

tive investments and real-estate
finance.
But even with enrollment in
classes holding steady, Robert
Koonce, the director of undergrad-
uate student affairs in the BBA Pro-
gram office, said a change to the
program was more necessary than
ever to help students navigate the
current economy.
"The finance faculty thought it
was time for some changes based
on what's going on in the world
to try to keep the program presti-
gious," he said.

U students reconnect with Detroit Unvesityalu,"

More than 800 head
downtown for this
year's DP Day
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
DETROIT - With brushes,
sandpaper and buckets of paint in
hand, more than 40 University stu-
dents gathered this weekend in the
halls of Priest Elementary to give
the school's lockers a much -needed
paint job.
The group, primarily made up
of members of the business frater-
nity Phi Chi Theta, was one of more
than 27 groups from the University
volunteering in the 10th-annual
Detroit Partnership Day.
This year, more than 800 stu-
dents participated in the annual day
of service known as "DP Day." The
event is organized by The Detroit
Partnership, a service-learning
organization focused on creating a
stronger connection between the
University and the city of Detroit.
Students worked in areas locat-
ed mostly around southwest and
northwest Detroit, doing a variety
of activities like repainting schools,
clearing abandoned buildings for
demolition and planting trees on
city blocks.
The first DP Day, in 2000, was
created as a way to get University
students more interested in Detroit
through community service proj-
ects. Beginning with about 400
participants, the event has now

Daily StaffReporter
Michigan's next governor
could come from right here in
Ann Arbor. Rick Snyder, a local
venture capitalist and University
alum, is considering running as a
Republican candidate for gover-
nor in 2010.
Snyder announced in a press
release earlier this month that he

has formed an exploratory com-
mittee to assess the possibility of
a gubernatorial run next year.
"I am in the process of putting
together the best team of advisors
this state and countryhas to offer,"
Snyder wrote in the release.
Snyder went on to write that he
will travel around the state, talk-
ing with citizens for the next few
weeks to learn more about the
problems Michigan residents face.
"Oureconomyisinshamblesand

more than doubled in size, attract-
ing student groups seeking service
projects that help surrounding
communities.
LSA senior Julia Roberts, a
volunteer at Priest Elementary,
stressed the importance of service
work in Detroit.
"There is so much cleanup to be
done in Detroit. (DP Day) is a great
way to contribute," she said. "It's a
great form of solidarity with sur-
rounding communities."
Priest Elementary is located in a

neighborhood in southwest Detroit
that has seen better days. The walls
outside the schoolyard are littered
with graffiti and the lockers inside
are faded and paint-chipped.
The work of paintingthe school's
lockers began last year, when half
of the lockers in the main hallway
received a fresh coat. This year the
work continued, as students sand-
ed down lockers before giving the
hallway a new splash of color with
blue, yellow and red paint..
Business junior Cory Rosenfield,

who volunteered at Priest Elemen-
tary, said he found the work done
on DP Day to be simple, but impor-
tant in helping to clean up Detroit.
"We're here just to paint and do
anything that the janitor needs,"
he said. "It's really too bad that we
can't see how the kids react to what
we've done in the halls. It would be
nice to see that."

of Phi Chi Theta, attributes DP

ApplicantstoYaleUniversitywill no
longer receive a rejection letter in the
mail, theYale Daily Newsreported.
To save paper and reduce mailing
costs, Yale University will not mail
rejection notices if the prospective
student has checked the decision
online. Yale announced the plan last
week in an effort to cut expenses
after the university's endowment
decreased this year.
In the article, Yale Dean of Admis-
sions Jeff Brenzel said the change
will save the university from print-
ing and mailing more than 20,000
rejection letters.
He added that 95 percent of appli-
cants check the decisions online with-
in 72 hours after they are posted.
Yale will still send paper letters
notifying students if they are accept-
ed or placed on the waiting list. If
students do not check the admission
decision online, the university will
send them a letter regardless of the
decision.

HARVARD TRADITION TURNS
DANGEROUS
RiverRun-along-standingHarvard
tradition in which students write the
name of their desired housing on card-
board boats to sail down the Charles
River - ended with the presence of the
Cambridge Fire Department and Mas-
sachusetts State Police this year, The
Harvard Crimson reported.
The event began with students
launching their creations into the
river. Students then started to drench
their boats with flammable solutions
like Axe Body Spray and nail polish
remover, which drew the attention of
firefighters and police. Some then lit
their boats on fire.
Officials warned the students to
leave the area.
In retaliation, Harvard freshman
Kelsey Koff and her group of friends
disobeyed the orders.
"We went all the way down to the
other end of the river and doused our
boat in nail polish remover," Koff said.

CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES
DRASTICALLY REDUCE
THEIRACCEPTANCE RATES
Students who would normally
be accepted to universities in Cali-
fornia may now receive more rejec-
tion letters than acceptance letters,
The Chronicle of Higher Education
reported.
The drastic cut in admission accep-
tances is a result of the initiative to
decrease enrollment in California
universities by 10,000 full-time stu-
dents - a decision made in light of
the state's economic crisis.
Pat Lopes Harris, a spokeswoman
for San Jose State University, said
determining which students to reject
is hard on admissions officials.
"It comes with great difficulty
because the same staff who normally
works to figure out which people get
in now has to turn around and figure
out which people need to be exclud-
ed," Harris said in the article.

State employees
resist budget cuts
State workers who didn't get
a raise this fiscal year while see-
ing their health care premiums
double are resisting talk of more
concessions.
But they may not be able to
dodge the bulls-eye on their backs
as the state's financial situation,
already shaky, grows worse. With
hundreds of millions of dollars to
be made up, one of the places state
government is looking to save is
labor costs.
State employees have been here
before, enduring furlough days
and other concessions earlier in
the decade. None of the state's
52,600 employees are eager to
relive those times.
"We've given and given and
given. That's the thing that's so
frustrating," said Steve Gilroy, 53,
who does billing and reimburse-
ment at the state's Kalamazoo
Psychiatric Hospital.
House Republicans caused a stir
last week by proposing to reduce
state workers' wages 5 percent
in the current budget. They also
want to freeze a 1 percent raise this
October and a 3 percent raise in
October 2010 and boost workers'
share of health premiums from 10
percent to 15 percent.
WASHINGTON
Tobacco prices rise
in lieu of new tax
However they satisfy their nic-
otine cravings, tobacco users are
facingabighit asthe single largest
federal tobacco tax increase ever
takes effect Wednesday.
Tobacco companies and public
health advocates, longtime foes in
the nicotine battles, are trying to
turn the situation to their advan-
tage. The major cigarette makers
raisedpricesacoupleofweeksago,
partly to offset any drop in profits
once the per-pack tax climbs from
39 cents to $LOl.
Medical groups see a tax
increase right in the middle of a
recession as a great incentive to
help persuade smokers to quit.
Tobacco taxes are soaring to
finance a major expansion of
health insurance for children.
President Barack Obama signed
that health initiative soon after
taking office.
Other tobacco products,
from cigars to pipes and smoke-
less, will see similarly large tax
increases, too. For example, the
tax on chewing tobacco will go
up from 19.5 cents per pound to
SO cents. The total expected to
be raised over the 4 1/2 year-long
health insurance expansion is
nearly $33 billion.
KIRKUK, Iraq
UN mulls power-

Seeking to head off an explo-

Nations will call for a power-shar-
ing system of government for
Iraq's deeply divided region of
Kirkuk in the oil-rich north.
A draft U.N. plan, outlined to
The AssociatedPressbytwo West-
ern officials, aims to defuse dan-
gerous tensions. Kurds, a majority
in the region, have been trying to
wrest control from Arabs, Turko-
menand otherrival ethnic groups.
If open warfare breaks out, it
could jeopardize the U.S. goal of
stability across Iraq before elec-
tions at year's end.
Peaceful elections are criti-
cal to reducing the U.S. presence
in Iraq, promised by President
Barack Obama.
The U.N. has played only a
minor role in Iraq since 2003,

Now, officials in Kirkuk say
the U.N. efforts may be the last
chance for a peaceful outcome.

On campus, Pandora founder talks of life's work

Westergren aims to
transform the way
people listen tomusic
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
When Tim Westergren, the
founder ofthe Internetradioservice
Pandora, asked a packed Stamps
Auditorium on Friday afternoon,
"how many people here have used
Pandora?" all the hands in the room
went up.
The Pandora phenomenon has
been sweeping the nation since it
launched in 2005. The free web-
site allows users to discover new
music based on the artists they
already like.
Westergren said that through
Pandora - as an established radio
service with about 600,000 songs in
its collection - he aims to reinvent
radio and help lesser-known artists
gain the publicity they deserve.
Westergren, who was brought
in by the campus entrepreneurship
group MPowered, said he aspires
to change today's radio, which "is
very limited in the music it plays,"
and transform it to "something
that's much more satisfying and
personalized."
Seventy percent of Pandora's
music library belongs to artists
without a record label, Westergren
said. He explained that as long as
the quality of the recording meets
Pandora's standards, any music is

entered into the database.
He said that he hopes to "turn
Pandora into a massive promotional
channel for tens of thousands of oth-
erwise invisible workingmusicians."
In 2007, when Pandora's exis-
tence was threatened by sky high
performancefees,Westergrensolic-
ited the help of the website's mil-
lions of users. Westergren said he
sent an e-mail to subscribed users
asking them to write to Congress.
He said the overwhelming response
kept Pandora in business.
"Washington received 400,000
faxes in three days and eventually
about 2 million calls, faxes, and let-
ters to Congress,' he said.
In the near future, Pandora plans
on going global so that music lovers
and musicians all over the world
can enjoy the benefits of Pandora
radio, Westergren said.
After studying political science at
Stanford University, Westergren's
idea for Pandora was born from his
experience as a struggling musi-
cian, he said.
As he played in bands and hung
around fellow musicians, Wester-
gren said he noticed a discouraging
problem.
"What I saw was a tremendous
number of very talented musicians
who nobody knew about," he said.
After reading an article about
a semi-well-known artist whose
record company refused to release
another one of her CD's, Wester-
gren decided to create a solution
that would expose lesser-known
artists to the ears of the world.

I kind of put this thing all
together and thought, 'well there's
a genome thing,' " he said. " 'Maybe
if I can marry that to technology,
some kind of algorithm, I could
deliver (the artist's music) to the
Web asa recommendation tool.'"'
After sharing the idea with a
friend, renting office space, hiring
engineers and finding investors,
Westergren's Music Genome Proj-
ect was put into action.
Yet the road to success for Pan-
dora was far from smooth. Wester-
gren said that in mid-2001, after
the investors' money ran out and ;.
some of the technology collapsed,
employees' paychecks shrank until
they were non-existent.
He said that for three years, about
50 people worked without pay.
"We were really in a pretty deep
dark hole," Westergren said. "I
had 11 maxed-out credit cards and
I owed I think a couple hundred
thousand dollars to friends and
family."
Now with 25 million registered
U.S. listeners - a number that
grows by 50,000 people each day
- Pandora has finally reached the SAID ALSAL AH/Daily

forced out, Chrysler
required to partner
with Fiat in final plan
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House says neither General
Motors nor Chrysler submitted
acceptable plans to receive more
bailout money, setting the stage
for a crisis in Detroit and putting
in motion what could be the final
two months of two American auto
giants.
President Barack Obama and his
top advisers have determined that
neither company is viable and that
taxpayers will not spend untold bil-
lions more to keep the pair of auto-
makers open forever.Inalast-ditch
effort,theadministrationgaveeach
company a brief deadline to try one
last time to convince Washington it
is worth saving, said senior admin-
istration officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity to more
bluntly discuss the decision.
Obama was set to make the
announcement at 11 a.m. Monday
in the White House's foyer.
In an interview with CBS' "Face
the Nation" broadcast Sunday,
Obama said the companies must do
more to receive additional financial
aid from the government.
"We think we can have a suc-

cessful U.S. auto industry. But it's
got to be one that's realistically
designed to weather this storm
and to emerge - at the other end
- much more lean, mean and
competitive than it currently is,"
Obama said.
Frustrated administration offi-
cials said Chrysler cannot func-
tion as an independent company
under its current plan. They have
given Chrysler a 30-day window to
complete a proposed partnership
with Italian automaker Fiat SpA,
and will offer up to $6 billion to the
companies if they can negotiate a
deal before time runs out.
If a Chrysler-Fiat union cannot
be completed, Washington plans to
walk away, leave Chrysler destined
for a complete sell-off. No other
money is available.
Shawn Morgan, a Chrysler
spokeswoman, said the company
wants to work with the Treasury
Department and Obama's auto task
force but declined to comment on
the White House's plans.
"With the administration's
announcement on the restructur-
ing of the automotive industry
imminent, it would be inappropri-
ate to comment on speculation,"
Morgan said in a statement early
Monday morning.
For GM, the administration
offered 60 days of operating money
to restructure. A frantic top-to-
bottom effort began Sunday after

CEO Rick Wagoner resigned under
pressure from the White House.
Fritz Henderson, GM's presi-
dent and chief operating officer,
became the new CEO, a Treasury
Department source said. Board
member Kent Kresa, the former
chairman and CEO of defense con-
tractor Northrop Grumman Corp.,
will be interim chairman of the GM
board.
One official said a majority of
the GM board was expected to step
down.
Obama advisers saw public out-
rage come to an ugly head in recent
weeks, as populist anger escalated
over bonuses paid to American
International Group executives.
They realized Americans are frus-
trated with the economy and its
business leaders; they also said
they would not invest one dollar
more than was necessary to keep
the companies alive and would
walk away if it looked impossible.
Officials said GM had not
made good on promises made in
exchange for $13.4 billion in gov-
ernment loans, although there are
no plans to call in those loans.
Administration officials still
believe GM's chances are good,
given its global brand and its
research potential. Officials say
they are confident GM can put
together a plan that will keep pro-
duction lines moving in the com-
ing years.

U.S. says testing
would violate U.N.
security resolution
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
North Korea's plans to launch a
rocket as early as this week in defi-
ance of warnings threatens to undo
years of fitful negotiations toward
dismantling the regime's nuclear
program.
The U.S., South Korea and Japan
have told the North that any rocket
launch - whether it's a satellite or a
long-range missile - would violate
a 2006 U.N. Security Council Reso-
lution prohibiting Pyongyang from
any ballistic activity, and could
draw sanctions.
NorthKoreasaidsanctionswould
violate the spirit of disarmament
agreements, and said it would treat
the pactsas null and void if punished
for exercising its sovereign right to
send a satellite into space.
"Even a single word critical of the
launch" from the Security Council
will be regarded as a "blatant hos-
tile act," a spokesman with North
Korea's foreign ministry said Thurs-
day, according the North's state-run
Korean Central News Agency. "All
the processes for the denucleariza-
tion of the Korean Peninsula, which
have been pushed forward so far,
will be brought back to what used to
be before their start and necessary

strongmeasures willbe taken."
That would be a sharp reversal
from June 2008 when the North
made a promising move toward
disarmament, dramatically blow-
ing up a cooling reactor at its main
Yongbyon nuclear complex.
But the regime routinely back-
tracks on agreements, refuses to
abide by international rules and
wields its nuclear program like a
weapon when it needs to win con-
cessions from Washingtonor Seoul,
analysts say.
"History has shown them that
the more provocative they are, the
more attention they get. The more
attention they get, the more they're
offered," Peter M. Beck, a Kore-
an affairs expert who teaches at
American University in Washing-
ton and Yonsei University in Seoul,
said Sunday.
Despite years of negotiations and
impoverished North Korea's grow-
ing need for outside help, it's clear
the talkshave done little to curb the
regime's drive to build - and sell -
its atomic arsenal, experts say.
"Ifthis is Kim JongIl's welcoming
present to a new president, launch-
ing a missile like this and threaten-
ing to have a nuclear test, I think it
says a lot about the imperviousness
of this regime in North Korea to
any kind of diplomatic overtures,"
Defense Secretary Robert Gates
said in an interview broadcast on
"Fox News Sunday."

Zoning should start to look up
State development plan should account for residents' needs
Though the acronym "A2D2" sounds more like a rip-off of a
certain Star Wars robot, it's actually a proposal to regulate
city buildings. A2D2 means Ann Arbor Discovering Down-
town, a development and zoning plan currently working its way
through City Council after several years of discussion in the Ann
Arbor Planning Commission. The A2D2 plan includes a slew of sug-
gested regulations, but two proposals stand out as especially note-
worthy. For students, the proposals will affect the housing market
in Ann Arbor and determine city rules regarding environmentally
sensible buildings. As City Council and Ann Arbor residents discuss
the A2D2 plan, they should include proposals that support an envi-
ronmentally friendly, socio-economically diverse city.

Last Monday, the Ann Arbor City Council
held an open meetingto hear public feedback
on A2D2. This was just the first in a series of
City Council meetings that will determine
the final version of the plan. A2D2 aims to
divide Ann Arbor into two zones - the core
and the interface, which would each be sub-
ject to different rules. Some of the issues
addressed in A2D2 are parking limitations,
use guidelines and flood mitigation plans,
but the two most intensely discussed issues
are height caps and environmental regula-
tions for buildings.
Much of the argument seems to center on
how high the cap should be. City residents
often argue that height caps protect Ann
Arbor's aesthetic quality. But this argument
doesn't hold up against the pressing need to
expand the city - and building "up" is the
most reasonable practice. Taller buildings
are the best way to combat urban sprawl,
preventing further stratification of socio-
economic classes. When downtown hous-
ing is limited, it becomes more expensive.
Those who can't afford to live downtown
get pushed to the outskirts of the city.
For students, taller buildings mean more
affordable housing options closer to cam-
pus and the heart of the city. Housing prices
decrease as more options become available.
Havingclose, dense housing available in the
downtown and campus areas at reasonable
prices allow students and Ann Arbor resi-

dents to live closer together, encouraging
the diverse atmosphere on which the Uni-
versity prides itself. Because of these obvi-
ous benefits, City Council should not give
in to the demands to implement restric-
tive height caps. Instead, the debate should
focus on where to draw the lines that sepa-
rate the two zones.
Another important aspect of the A2D2
plan involves creating incentives for build-
ers to make their projects eco-friendly. Cur-
rently, A2D2 requires buildings to include
environmentally sound features approved
by the U.S. Green Building Council's Lead-
ership in Energy and Environmental Design
program for them to receive certain insur-
ance premiums. Students at the University
- and residents of Ann Arbor - are dedi-
cated to an environmentally friendly city.
This regulation will ensure that businesses
are making environmental responsibility a
top priority, too. Creating environmentally
friendly buildings should be among City
Council's top priorities.
City Council must stick to the guiding
principle of fostering a socio-economical-
ly diverse and environmentally friendly
downtown to make A2D2 a fitting plan for
the city. While provisions like the envi-
ronmental incentives will be good for the
city, City Council should adjust its atti-
tude toward height caps before approving
A2D2.

TO THE DAILY:
In a recent letter to the editor (Earth
Hour exemplifies anti-progressive principles,
03/27/2009), Victoria Miller opposes turning
off the lights for an hour to help the Earth. She
asked the readers to consider that "by flipping
that switch, you endorse the movement for
man to withdraw, to stop changing the envi-
ronment, and to exist in a primitive, 'natural'
state."
Victoria, with six billion people now on the
planet, humans are not about to withdraw even
if we all turned every light off for a week. Also,
please remember that manmade changes include

the release of deadly toxins, the clear cutting
of forests, the extinction of animals and the
destruction brought by climate change. There
is a balance, and all the wonderful conveniences
you gush about won't mean as much if you come

The Earth is out of balance because of people.
All ofushave aresponsibility, like itornot,tohelp
restore the Earth and slow, destructive, man-

Forty-four years ago this spring, President Lyndon
Johnson ordered the United States military to bomb
North Vietnam, initiating full-scale war. While the war
in Iraq is different in several key respects, the parallels
with the Vietnam War are striking. Both were thought
to be justified and winnable in a brief period, yet both
proved bitterly costly in lives, money and America's
moral standing - and both times, we have found our-
selves mired in a conflict with no clear end.
There's another way in which the wars are the same.
In both instances, there have been protests at the Uni-
versity, though these were more widespread and intense
for the Vietnam War. In March of 1965, three months
after I came to the University, Michigan held the nation's
first teach-in against the war. Instead of classes, profes-
sors and students planned to hold lectures and discus-
sions. Initially, 45 faculty members were involved, but
the number quickly grew to 200, bolstered by huge stu-
dent interest.
Governor George Romney and the Michigan State
Senate were furious about our activities. After a lot of
back-and-forth, we decided to hold the teach-in after
classes were done for the day. We used Hill Auditorium
and Angell Hall, and over 3,000 people debated and
discussed the war through the night and into the next
morning. At the time, it was one of the largest demon-
strations in the University's history.
As part of the teach-in, I spoke to a packed Hill Audi-
torium. There were students squeezed into the aisles and
anti-war chants shook the huge hall. As a biochemist, I
talked about the dangers of chemical and biological war-
fare being practiced by the Pentagon in Vietnam. Our
military was using nerve gas, agents that caused terrible
burns and blisters, and other chemical weapons against
the North Vietnamese. Never before, I told the crowd,
had chemicals been used to destroy crops, and not since
1936 had gas been deployed against military personnel
on such a large scale. Fearing that the University might
somehow be involved in what was happening,. I called
for an end to all secret and classified research here.
The next day, as we headed home from the success-
ful teach-in, we felt we had reached a broad consensus:
the war in Vietnam was unwinnable and represented a
new arrogance and aggression on the part of the United
States government. We drew the attention of schools
across the country, and Berkeley followed suit with a
teach-in that drew an astonishing 30,000 people.
Activism on our campus only grew. On the Diag, we

held a huge protest against. Dow Chemical, which was
responsible for chemical defoliants used by American
military aircraft to blanket fields in North Vietnam. In
all, the U.S. dumped about 12 million gallons of these
deadly herbicides on enemy territory, causing terrible
harm not just to the environment, but to countless civil-
ians. Our government used these agents because we
were one of the only major countries that had refused to
ratify the Geneva Protocol against chemical and biologi-
cal warfare.
A few months after, I came up with the idea for a peace
button to raise funds for the protest movement. An art- 4
ist friend and I worked out the design of a peace symbol
wreathed in holly. I sold the buttons on the Diag for 25
cents. They were gone in an hour. I ordered thousands
more and wherever I went in Ann Arbor - from the med-
ical campus to the farmer's market - I sold the buttons,
and I never seemed to have enough. We made posters
with the same symbol, which local shops and churches
put in their windows.
Protest against the war reached an even greater level
with the colossal New York City demonstration, and the
funds gained from button sales were used to pay railroad
fare for dozens of us to go to Manhattan. The current
site of the Gandy Dancer restaurant was the train sta-
tion at that time, and students, professors and towns-
people took over the whole place. We rode the New York
Central Railroad train via Canada, and the atmosphere
on the train was electric. In New York City, hundreds
of thousands of us marched, arms locked in a symbol of
unity, along with famous protestors from novelist Nor-
man Mailer to Dr. Benjamin Spock.
The Vietnam War was vastly unpopular by the sec-
ond term of the Nixon administration, and we finally
pulled out in 1975. How President Obama handles the
complex situation in Iraq remains uncertain, though he
still seems dedicated to the change he promised - and
I hope we will remain dedicated to holding him to this
promise. The University has a long and proud heritage
of standing up and dissenting when our political leaders
go astray. As is our constitutional right, we assemble and
speak freely, we criticize our leaders and we demand
change. And now that we have stood up and called for a
new direction in Iraq, let us be vigilant in ensuring that
our new president takes us there.

Selling celebrity
with ShamWow

In this country, you can show
someone on the streeta picture
of an important political figure
- let's say Vice President Joe Biden
- and there's a
decent chance the
person won't be
able to name that
political figure or
say what he or she >
does. But show that
sameAmerican JHE
civilian a picture BLOCK
of Matthew Lesko,
more commonly known as "that guy in
the question-mark suit," and, though
the person may notbe able to tell you
Lesko's name, the person will at least
be able to tell you that the question-
marked man can offer the secrets to
obtaining free money.
It's a sad truth that people know
more about celebrities than politicians.
It's an even sadder truth that info-
mercial hosts have joined the ranks of
other celebrities. Or at least I used to
think it was sad.
Matthew Lesko has written far
too many books, including at least
six whose titles begin with the words
"Free Money." Billy Mays has sold
everything from Lint-B-Gones and
Bedazzlers to ESPN's online coverage
r with his loud, in-your-face demeanor
and signature "Billy Mays here" intro.
Vince Shlomi (known in his infomer-
cials as "Vince Offer") is so universally
known for his ShamWow informercial
that a Wikipedia search for "Sham-
Wow" links directly to Shlomi's Wiki-
pedia profile.
When I first realized these "accom-
plishments" are more successful ways
to build celebrity than acting in an
indie film or performing in a Broadway
show, I was understandably pissed.
Even the most commodified pop stars
have some semblance of talent that
made them famous. What right do
Lesko, Mays and Shlomi have to be
household names compared to true
talents and personal favorites like Gael
Garcia Bernal ("The Science of Sleep")
or Michael Cerveris (who played the
titular role in the 2005 Broadway
revival of "Sweeney Todd")? But then
I came to realize they have the same
right to fame as anyone else.
Sure, infomercials may be incred-
ibly annoying, but that doesn't mean no
semblance of skill is required to pro-
duce them and make them successful.
Also, when you think about how many
infomercials exist, it's remarkable
some stand out above the others. Yet
Shlomi, Lesko, Mays and perhaps some
of the home-gym sellers (I'm looking
at you here, John Basedow) have done
just that. And they are now the famous
few among the commercial crowd.
Now, these wizards of sales could
never have built their star power with-
out setting themselves apart from the
rest. Lesko's high energy is engaging,
and his signature suit was one of the
most effective advertising ideas in the
entire infomercial world. Mays is just
a powerhouse, full of great product

ideas and capable of selling anything
with contagious enthusiasm. Relative
newcomer Shlomi has a youthful exu-
berance that makes his products seem
like must-haves for a new generation of
go-getters.
So it turns out these guys might
actually have talent after all. But now
that they have their celebrity status,
they need to make sure they live up to
its standards of scandal and question-
able moral decisions. Luckily for us,
they haven't disappointed.
Let's start with The Riddler-
wannabe Lesko, who has had a rough
relationship with both famous news-
papers and our nation's government,
as detailed in his Wikipedia page. In a
2007 Washington Post article, Lesko
admitted to plagiarizing his books
from the federal guidelines regard-
ing grants and loans, and he has been
criticized by The New York Times for
claimingto still be a part of the paper
despite the fact that he stopped writ-
ing his column in 1994. Also, in 2005,
Emmy-winning writer Bernard Gold-
berg "honored" Lesko by including
him in his book "100 People Who Are
Billy Mays has
real star power.
Screwing Up America."
Mays and Shlomi aren't unfamil-
iar with creating drama within the
infomercial community either. After
Shlomi's rise to ShamWow fame, Mays
called him out in a radio interview on
Feb. 10, claiming that Shlomi's product
was a clear knock-off of Mays's own
Zorbeez towel product. Mays went so
far as to say, "Billy Mays doesn't take
this" and "I am the ultimate pitch-
man."
Also, Shlomi assaulted a prostitute.
Really. Look it up. It just happened.
So it turns out infomercial celebri-
ties are no different than any other.
While celebs steal significant others
from each other, infomercial salesman
steal product ideas. While movie stars
get arrested for violating the law, Lesko
gets in trouble for plagiarizingthe
law and selling it as a book. And while
pop stars maybe loud and belligerent,
Mays's voice and Lesko's bright suit are
louder than all the celebrity singers in
this country combined.
So tobringthis all full circle, I have
two pieces of wisdom. First of all, don't
be as quick as I was to criticize infor-
mercial hosts - they've truly worked
their way to the top. Second of all, if
any of you are thinking about running
for elected office some day, start wear-
ing a crazily punctuated suit. It sucks
that it has come to this, but it might
just be the only way to get people to
pay attention to politics.

his bathroom. E-mail him atjamblock@

Globe"-trotting gaffe

University alum Dhani
Jones is a better
linebacker than a TV host
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily Arts Writer
The student body at the University of
Michigan is comprised
of the "leaders and best," *-
and alum Dhani Jones
is no exception. Jones Dhani Tackles
helped the Wolverines the Globe
win a football national
championship in 1998, Mondays
and he is currently a line- at 9 p.m.
backer on the Cincinnati Travel Channel
Bengals. Though Jones
has achieved a lot in his football career, his

career asa TV host needs alot of work.
In his show, "Dhani Tackles the Globe,"
Jones goes to a foreign countryto experience
the culture and food and, of course, to check
out the local sports. One episode sends Jones
to Switzerland to learn about the country's
national sport: schwingen. Thoughthe Swiss
assure Jones that schwingen is an intellec-
tual and strategic sport, it's really nothing
more than wrestling in sawdust - the only
catch being that players aren't allowed to
let go of their opponent's pants. Throughout
the episode, Jones trains, immerses himself
in Swiss culture and eventually flaunts his
skills in a schwingen tournament.
Because all of Travel Channel's program-
ming is very similar, "Dhani Tackles the
Globe" stands out among the monotony. It's
a smart move for a travel show to use sports
as its grabbing gimmick. It's also a welcome
change of pace. Travel aficionados and sports

enthusiasts alike can enjoy the culture and
history exhibited in obscure sports from
around the world.
Though a show like "Dhani Tackles the
Globe" is a clever way to attract a broad
audience, Dhani Jones might not have
been the best choice for a host. He has no
idea how to conduct an interview, even an
informal one. Whenever the conversation
lagged, Jones reverted back to one question:
"Will this help me with my schwingen?" He
was always answered with a blank stare,
which he attributed to a language barrier.
But clearly, the answer meant "how would
milking cows / playing an alphorn / eating
fondu / yodeling / wearing traditional Swiss
attire / making meringue help you with your
schwingen?" Jones really needs to work on
his casual conversation skills.
After playing in many high-pressure

Museum of Art opens to the public

24-hour grand
reopening event well
received by visitors
By JOHN A. WEISS, JR.
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michigan
Museum of Art welcomed the
general public back into Alumni
Memorial Hall Saturday evening
after nearly three years.
UMMA, now sporting a newly
added wing and a refurbished inte-
rior, had its official 24-hour long
grand reopening for the public this
weekend. The museum had been
closed while it underwent nearly
$42 million worth of construction
and renovations.
A crowd of around 400 students
and community members were
waiting outside when James Stew-
ard, the director of the Museum of
Art, officially opened the doors.
"Let's declare the art museum
open, and let's go in," he said, tell-
ing the crowd the museum already
had 7,000 visitors during its
"dynamic opening week."
More than doubling the size of
the original building, the $41.9 mil-
lion Maxine and Stuart Frankel
and the Frankel Family Wing is a
53,000-square-foot expansion of
the original facilities.
The new wing, with its glass-
oriented design drawn by architect
Brad Cloepfil and his company,
Allied Works Architectureis meant
to complementthe Beaux-Artsstyle
of Alumni Hall, which was erected
in 1910 as a memorial for University
veterans of 19th-century wars and
to add lecture halls, meeting rooms
and space for the Alumni Associa-
tion headquarters. While helping

house its 18,000-piece collection,
the museum addition increases the
number of galleries, study rooms,
state-of-the-art conservation and
art storage facilities, a 225-seat
auditorium and classrooms and
event spaces, along with a new
research center, expanded museum
store and a Wi-Fi accessible cafe.
The museum also has expanded
public programming, offering more
events in performing arts, spoken
word, film and art making.
"I think we pretty much rein-
vented ourselves," Steward said in a
phone interview after the opening.
Steward said the 24-hour opening
was intended to draw different com-
munities on campusto the museum.
"We're really happy to see so
many peoplehere,"he said."It seems
to be a pretty diverse crowd."
Many events and attractions
were scheduled during the week-
end to celebrate the museum's
opening. Multiple University and
community choirs, dance troupes
and musical groups performed.
There were also yoga sessions, fit-
ness consultations, poetry read-
ings, a scavenger hunt for kids and
docent-led tours.
Ruth Slavin, director of educa-
tion at the museum, said she envi-
sions UMMA as a place where
staff, faculty, students and the
public meet for the arts.
"I see this as a place for every-
one," she said, adding that whether
coming for a class, a performance
or to see a film, there is something
for people of all interests.
Slavin added that the museum
expects 200,000 visitors this year.
She said when she joined the
museum's staff 11 years earlier,
only roughly 1,100 students visited
each year. Now roughly 30,000
students are expected to visit.

Steward echoed Slavin's com-
ments, saying the museum is once
again open as a resource and attrac-
tion on campus. UMMA had been
operating on a temporary basis
from an off-site exhibition space on
South University Avenue while the
museum was revamped.
"We want to serve the Universi-
ty's teaching and research mission,
but that's not enough," he said.
The purpose of the museum,
Steward said, is to create "some-
thing that will make your lives
richer and fuller, to develop critical
thinking, and to explore the things
that bind us together."
"Art canbe auniversal language,"
he continued. "I ask people to real-
ly take the time to rediscover the
museum and ask how artcan be part

of daily life. Think of the art muse-
um as something to turn to for dif-
ferent reasons to cheer you up, calm
you down or challenge yourself."
Tiffany Purnell, an project coor-
dinator of the Barger Leadership
Institute with the organizational
Studies program, was among those
there for the opening.
"I've never visited the museum
before," she said. "I figured opening
nightisthe bestdaycto do it."
LSA freshman Anna Weiss
attended the grand reopening
because she wanted to see the
architecture exhibit and photogra-
phy displays.
"I wanted to check it out," she
said. "I have an interest in art. I
have been craving goingto a muse-
um for a long time."

Snyder added that he wants to
provide residents with the neces-

"The No.1 priority will be to pro-
vide a vision to the people of this
state that will give them hope and

a clear road map back to sound eco-

Snyder is the former president

Representatives at Ardesta said
last week that Snyder was not yet
willing to be interviewed about his
gubernatorial bid.
If Snyder decides to run, he

will be one of many Republican
candidates vying for the party's
nomination. Thoughthe Michigan
Republican party is declining to
endorse any candidates through-

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
This is a curious day. No doubt, you'll
start off feeling worried or anxious about
something. However, don't dwell there,
because later in the day, your dealings
with friends and groups bring you joy.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
You might feel financially squeezed
about children, sports or something hav-
ing to do with entertainment and social
functions. Fortunately, later on, good
news from a boss or parent makes your
day!
GEMINI
(May 21 toJune 20)
Relations with family members, espe-
cially parents or older relatives, might be
stressed today. People are too quick to be
critical. Fortunately, later in the day, you
feel confused abouttravel or educational
opportunities.
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
You might feel worried in the begin-
ning of the day and not know why. It's
just a feeling. Fortunately, feelings
change! Later in the day, you feel just
great!
LEO
(July 23 toAug. 22)
Difficulties (or perhaps just a disap-
pointment) with friends about money
issues or possessions plague you today.
Others are a wonderful source of com-
fort and joy later. (Whew!)
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Difficulties with authority figures,
parents, bosses and VIPs are likely early
today. However, later in the day, you get
positive recognition for your work.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct.2)
Avoid arguments about religion, poli-
tics and racial issues. Travel might be
delayed. Expect a fun incitation later in

the day to enjoy yourself. (Thank heav-
ens.)
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Avoid important discussions about
shared property, taxes, debt and inheri-
tances. Make plans to enjoy family gath-
erings this evening.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Conversations with partners, bosses
and significant others are difficult early
today. People are too quick to be critical!
Enjoy relaxing times with siblings and
friends in the late afternoon or evening.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Difficulties at work, especially related
to travel, foreign countries and publish-
ing are hard to avoid today. However,
good money news later in the day lifts
your spirits!
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Accept increased responsibilities with
children today. This could isclude
increased expenses as well. Later, you'll
enjoy fun, games, sports and playful
activities.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Be patient with partners and family
members today. This patience will pay
off when you entertain at home or enjoy
good times with relatives over pizza and
beer!
YOU BORN TODAY You're not a
quitter. You're tenacious in whatever
you pursue because you're passionately
interested in your cause. You will fight
for your beliefs. You're capable of mak-
ing a radical change in your occupation;
many of you do. This year something
you've been involved with for the past
nine years will diminish or end in order
to create room for something new.

Political Science Prof. John
Jackson said early indications sug-
gest that victory could be easier
to attain for Republicans in the
2010 gubernatorial race than in
past years particularly because of
Michigan's economy.
"I don't think the state economy
is going to be better, and there is no
dominant national race to compete
with state races," Jackson said.
Still, Jackson said it is too early
to comment on how Snyder may
fare in the primary against other
Republican candidates.
"He said that he was active in
Michigan economic development
affairs, but beyond that I don't
know how he stands on a whole
range of issues, particularly ones
Republicans care about," he said.
According to the Ardesta web-
site, Snyder graduated from the
University in. 1977 and earned a
Master of Business Administration
in 1979 and a Juris Doctor in 1982.
In addition to his work at Ard-
esta, Snyder is chairman of Ann
Arbor SPARK, which the Ardesta
website describes as the "innova-
tive focused economic develop-
ment organization formed by the
University of Michigan and local
and state government."
Snyder is also a board member
of the University's Tech Transfer
Advisory Board, Literature, Sci-
ence & Arts Advisory Board and the
Comprehensive Cancer Center.
He currently lives in Ann Arbor
with his wife and three children.

games in the National Football League, Jones shouldn't
think much of a folksy schwingen tournament. Even
so, the man takes sports very seriously and does all he
can to increase the drama of the game. His warm-up
routine is filmed with close-ups from various angles
and he gives a dramatic narration of what he's thinking
("If I don't do this, no one will") to heighten the audi-
ence's anxiety. His concentration is unfaltering during
play, where he pouts over a penalty call. Dhani Jones is

opening scene, the audience is introduced to Totfl
(Italian newcomer Salvatore Abruzzese), a malleable
young delivery boy who wishes to join the ranks of
the Camorra in hopes of sharing in the organiza-
tion's wealth and power. The film then focuses on
the reprehensible actions of a greedy waste disposal
contractor and his reluctant associate, a tailor who
defects from his Camorra-owned manufacturing job,
a lowly money-carrier and two disillusioned hellions
named Marco (Italian newcomer Marco Macor) and
Ciro (Italian newcomer Ciro Petrone) who idolize the
infamous "Tony Montana."
"Gomorra" is unlike the typical multiple-narra-
tive film in that its five plot threads rarely converge.
Instead, the story is essentially five separate short

quite possibly the only American to have ever argued
with a schwingen official.
The locations are exciting and the sports are fasci-
nating and obscure, but Dhani Jones'slackluster ability
as a TV personality makes "Dhani Tackles the Globe"
a laughable project. A successful host is engaging and
not afraid to make fun of his or her situation. Rather
than taking the games so seriously, Jones should fash-
ion his hosting style after Mike Rowe of Discovery's
"Dirty Jobs," who makes awkward interviews funny.
Maybe Jones will calm down and come into his ele-
ment as the season progresses. But until then, all we
know is that a raging Wolverine and a friendly game of
schwingen don't mix.
films that share only their thematic material (name-
ly the treacherous actions of the Camorra) and the
equally harrowing nature of their conclusions. By the
movie's end, every character has sold his soul out of
greed, fear or betrayal.
The film is an expos6 that brings to the foreground
the cancerous effects of the Camorra in Italy. The
problem is prominent when considering the dan-
gers associated with the film's production - death
threats were made against several people involved in
the production of the film, including Roberto Savia-
no, the author of the book from which the film was
adapted. Additionally, several of the actors featured
in the film were later found to be directly involved
with the Camorra.
In spite of the unadulterated authenticity of
"Gomorra," the limited character development and
lack of plot convergence detract from the film's
entertainment value and consign it to the position of
a fragmented, emotionally aloof docudrama.

Domestic disaster
strikes ABC Family

'Roommates' relies
on a mixture of stale
premises and jokes
By BRIGID KILCOIN
Daily Arts Writer
"Roommates" is such a god-
awful show that it makes the rest
of ABC Family's
programming
look deep by
comparison. Roommates
The show
focuses on Mondays
the hijinks at 9 p.m.
and romantic ABC Family
entanglements
of young New
York 20-somethings. The plot
goes like this: Mark (newcomer
Tyler Francavilla), the show's
focal point, bumps into his high-
school sweetheart Katie (fellow
newcomer Dorian Brown) in an
elevator. After Katie mentions
she's looking for a roommate,
Mark uproots his life and moves
all of his things to her apartment
in Brooklyn so he can exist in
closer proximity to her. Along the
way, he encounters her quirky co-
inhabitants and her on-again-off-
again boyfriend.
Everything about "Roommates"

is tired. The show's plot is ripped
off from horrible 1970s sitcoms,
and the dialogue is trite and unre-
alistic. There's a heavy reliance on
comedic misunderstandings inthe
style of "Three's Company," which
is not only unfunny, but actually
irritating to watch.
In one situation, Katie pours
out her heart to Mark about an
unnamed romantic interest she's
uncertain about persuing. Big sur-
prise:Markthinkssheisreferringto
him and tells her to go for it. Shock-
ingly, it turns out she was refer-
ring to an old boyfriend. Purposely
vague conversations in which the
participants walk away with differ-
ent ideas of what just happened are
the backbone of "Roommates" -
each episode would be roughly five
minutes long if the characters just
talked to each other.
Characters in "Roommates" are
shallow and undeveloped; they
also steadfastly avoid the course
of action a normal human might
take. For example, Hope (Tamera
Mowry, "Sister Sister") dresses
for work in a pantsuit and heels to
trick her roommates into thinking
she is a high-powered Hollywood
executive rather than a lowly
barista. The other characters on
the show are similarly uninven-
tive: Hope's boss is a flamboy-
ant gay man who manages to be

a walking embodiment of every
homosexual stereotype. Likewise,
the one-dimensional Katie has no
notable qualities other than being
attractive.
The show's performers are a
ragtag array of alumni from other
lackluster sitcoms and newcomers
including Tony Yalda, who previ-
ously setthe world on fire with his
performance as "American Idol" 's
Sanjaya Look-A-Like in the 2008
film "Meet the Spartans." The
lack of legitimate acting experi-
ence might account for the over-
the-top reactions and constant
high-pitched yelling that pass as
emoting on "Roommates."
As a whole, "Roommates" is for-
gettable at best, bafflingly point-
less at worst. The show's subject
matter - dealing with the stressful
adjustment to adult life after com-
pleting college - could have been
appealing in the right hands, but
the show goes for cheap laughs and
slapstick rather than striving for
comedy that is true to life. "Room-
mates" manages to be a half hour
of television completely devoid of
any original content whatsoever.
While ABC Family has carved a
niche in basic cable by providing
viewers with family-friendly fluff,
"Roommates" is almost aggres-
sively stupid and altogether unap-
pealing.

Jung's ability to reduce errors and
compete strong throughout the
entire match that enabled him to

defeated Harvard 5-2.
The Wolverines' win was a
long time coming. Their last four

been decided by a 4-3 margin.
"This obviously gives us a lot of

said. "With the win, we kind of get

But Michigan's weekend wasn't
perfect. On Saturday, the Wolver-

Wolverines trump tough BYU squad

By JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
On one sideline stood a group of
Brigham Young lacrosse reserves
in clean uniforms, some without
helmets or gloves. In the biggest
game of their season to date, the
players tossed balls against the
wall of Oosterbaan Fieldhouse and
seemed to wish away the remain-
ing time on the game clock.
The solid wall of fully suited
players in maize jerseys on the
opposite sideline clapped and
shouted for the duration of No. 1

Michigan's 14-11 win over the Cou-
gars on Saturday night.
"We really preach togetherness
and everybody supporting each
other," Michigan coach John Paul
said. "And that's a big part of what
this team is."
"We definitely pride ourselves
on respect and discipline," added
junior attackman Kevin Zorovich.
"We come into each game knowing
that we prepare better than any-
one, and we respect everybody. We
want to represent Michigan to the
fullest."
Such dedication is typical of

the rapidly growing varsity club
lacrosse program. The Wolverines
(9-0) won their 30th consecutive
game, a streak dating back to the
2007 season.
Junior midfielder David Rein-
hard won the first five faceoffs of
the game to help the Wolverines
grab an early 4-1 lead. After a few
costly turnovers, Michigan's lead
dwindled to one goal with 5:19
remaining in the first half.
"We had to gut check a little bit
and outwork them," Paul said.
Zorovich and sophomore attack-
man Trevor Yealy did just that,
combining for five consecutive
goals to put the game out of reach.
Late in the third quarter, Cougar
goalie D.J. Sullivan made a tough
save on a shot fired at the top of the
box. Yealy slyly snatched a rebound
out of Sullivan's stick and scored.
"We're hard to match up with
offensively, and Trevor's a big part
of that," Paul said. "If you slide

from Trevor, you're in trouble. He's
a great target, he doesn't need a lot
of space and he's gonna finish."
Yealy camped out on the crease
for much of the game, taking
advantage of his tall frame and
quick release to tally four goals.
Senior midfielder Anthony Hruso-
vsky added three goals and two 4
assists just one game after his sev-
en-point performance in a 21-4 win
over Central Michigan.
Numerous recruits watched the
impressive victory from the stands
and met with Paul after the game
to discuss the future of the pro-
gram.
"We've taken a lot of pride in the
way we recruit and the kids we're
recruiting," Paul said. "That's
something that a lot of people don't
realize around here. We recruit
like a varsity team."
And having won every game
since 2007, this Wolverine squad
plays like a varsity team, too.

Michigan exploded for 11 runs

By RYAN KARTJE
DailySports Writer
It was the bottom of the 7th
inning on Saturday as Michigan
sophomore relief pitcher Tyler
Burgoon approached the mound.
The Wolverines were in a 1-1
deadlock with Iowa in the first
weekend of Big Ten play.
Burgoon tossed a wild pitch
that flew past freshman catcher
Coley Crank, sending a Hawkeye
baserunner home to break the tie.
Michigan (2-1 Big Ten, 16-7 over-
all) couldn't recover from the 2-1
deficit and suffered its first Big
Ten loss at Duane Banks Field in
Iowa City.
The only thing colder than the
Wolverine bats was the weather,
which spent most of the weekend
below 40 degrees.
"When the weather is so bad,
so cold, it's usually a low-scoring
game," fifth-year senior outfielder
Kenny Fellows said of Saturday's
2-1 loss. "It's tough to get the bats
going in those situations when
they're already so cold."
To manufacture more runs,
Fellows knew the Wolverines
would need to play scrappy base-
ball and improve the small-ball
aspect of their game to build on
' their Friday win and claim the

Big Ten opening series on Sun-
day.
The former walk-on responded
yesterday to the tune of a career-
high four hits and four stolen
bases as Michigan cruised to a
7-5 win over Iowa (1-2, 9-12).
Michigan coach Rich Maloney
called the team's performance "a
gritty one, to say the least".
"Thank goodness we got a run-
ning game going finally," Malo-
ney said. "It's been stalled for
quite a while. And today, Kenny
Fellows was great. He was our
spark plug."
The rest of the Wolverines con-
tributed two more steals to give
the team a season-high six stolen
bases. It couldn't have come at a
better time. After two baserun-
ners were picked off in the wan-
ing innings of Michigan's 3-1 loss
to Eastern Michigan last week,
Maloney admitted baserunning
was key to the Wolverines' suc-
cess.
And on Sunday, Michigan's
improved baserunning disrupted
the Hawkeyes' defensive efforts
and allowed the team to put last
week's embarrassing loss to the
Eagles behind them.
Of course, the return of a
legitimate offensive threat from
Michigan's bats sure helped as

the Wolverines had four players
with multiple hits on the after-
noon.
"Ittookeveryounce ofenergy we
had to get it done," Maloney said.
"Now, we have a lot of guys just
waiting in the wings, so they have
to be scrappy in order to win."
In the series opener Friday, the
Wolverines sent ace senior pitch-
er Chris Fetter to the mound. Just
like all season, he didn't disap-
point.
After allowing three runs in
the first inning, Fetter rebounded
to throw a complete game. He
gave up five hits and struck out
nine Hawkeye batters to lead
Michigan to a narrow 4-3 win.
The winning run came cour-
tesy of a sacrifice fly from senior
second baseman Kevin Cislo in
the eighth inning that scored
senior pinch runner Nick Urban.
The real difference from the
Wolverine bats came from junior
first baseman Mike Dufek who
was 6 of 12 with four RBI on the
weekend to continue his hot hand
as of late.
In a conference that looks tobe
much closer than in past seasons,
the Wolverines will need offen-
sive production from players like
Dufek and Fellows who have been
"waiting in the wings".
"The last few years we were
dominant (in the Big Ten),"
Maloney said. "But we knew that
wasn't the case this year. On any
given day, any of these teams can
beat each other up ... It's going
to be a contested race right to the
end."

on eight hits in the first inning
of the second game. The inning
also included a stretch where 12
straight batters reached base safe-
ly.
With a 4-for-5 performance
from the plate, Chidester could
have left it at that and had a good
day. But the utility player also
showed her defensive prowess.
Playing catcher in the first
game, Chidester made two dynam-
ic plays. On a small foul pop up, she
made the only play possible, a div-
ing stab to her left to record the
out.
With runners on second and
third in the bottom of the seventh,
a slow roller came to Nemitz, who
quickly sent it to Chidester.
Chidester caught the ball and
lunged back to make the play at
home, keeping the game out of
reach.
Now, the Wolverines can focus
on Big Ten play. With Michigan's
0-2 start in conference play after
two losses to Northwestern last
weekend and the elimination of
a conference tournament, regu-
lar season play is more important
than in past years to determine
postseason seeding.
The Wolverines return to action

Penn State.
thing there is at the University of
Michigan, particularly our Athlet-
ic Department," Rodriguez said.
"Our spring game is, more than
anything else, a spring event. Our
Athletic Department has done a
terrific job of trying to promote
that."
A member of the Athletic
Department said the roster for
the alumni flag football game - a
new tradition for the spring game
weekend - will slowly leak over
the coming weeks on Rodriguez's
official facebook.com page.
On Saturday, the only thing
Rodriguez knew about the roster
was that a few former members
of the Wolverines who won Super
Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh
Steelers this year would be play-
ing in the game. LaMarr Wood-
ley and Larry Foote are the only
Michigan players on the current
Steelers roster.
A member of the Athletic
Department said he was contact-
ing the members of the NFL Super
Bowl runners-up Arizona Cardi-
nals about playing. Steve Breas-
ton, Gabe Watson, Alan Branch
and Victor Hobson are all on the
current Cardinals' roster.
The Detroit Free Press con-
firmed that Rick Leach, Derrick
Walker, Jim Betts and Bill Dufek
will be participating.

FOOTBALL

It was achance for younger play-
ers - especially those like fresh-
man Tate Forcier, who enrolled at
Michigan early to participate in
these practices - to exhibit their
play-making abilities.
"You don't get a lot of coaching
during a scrimmage, and that's by
design," Rodriguez said. "You just
kind of sit back ... let them play and
see who steps up.
"For some of the new guys that
are in this environment, we want
to see how they compete without
a coach telling them what to do on
every snap."
Forcier played with the first
team because redshirt junior Nick
Sheridan fractured his right leg
during Tuesday's practice.
Although Rodriguez planned
to use a smaller playbook for the
scrimmage, he said he would
"simplify a little bit," while Forci-
er took snaps.
"We've got to be able to run the
offense, but we've got a smaller
package in anyway," Rodriguez
said. "In particular, in the scrim-
mage, not only because of him but
because of some of the other young
guys. I don't want them thinking
too much - just let them play."

LINE SHIFT: After redshirting
last season, there are six linemen
making waves during spring prac-
tice. With their addition to the
roster, Rodriguez and his staff are
still waiting for five to emerge as
starters.
"I don't really have a first group
yet," Rodriguez said. "We've got
six or seven or eight that are rotat-
ing in the first group ... I think it's
still a work in progress."
Rodriguez is still consider-
ing shifting redshirt junior Steve
Schilling to guard, but he was
quick to mention that nothing is
set in stone just yet.
"I want him to wind up where
our best five are at," Rodriguez
said. "If our best five have Steve at
guard and somebody else at tackle,
that's fine. I think he's comfortable
in there. I also think he's athletic
enough to play both spots."
FIRST GLANCE: Although Sat-
urday's scrimmage was closed,
the public will have the chance
to see the Wolverines play at the
spring game on April 11 at noon at
Michigan Stadium.
More information about
the additional festivities was
announced before Saturday's
practice.

The Wolverines nearly doubled the despite letting 43 shots reach Volk-

defensive game.
"When you look at the game,
they had a lot of shots," Serratore
said. "But how many second shots
did they get? How many outnum-
bered situations did they have? ...
The entire game, how many back-
door shots did they get? How many

"You can't hold ateam like that to
no shots. But we said, 'If they score,
they're going to have to score one-
shot goals.' And scoring one-shot
goals on Andrew Volkening is not
an easy task."
When Air Force took a 2-0 lead
seven minutes into the second peri-
od, Michigan's poise turned into
urgency, and thaturgency gradually
devolved into frustration. When an
official would remove a Wolverine
from the faceoff circle for being too
quick on the draw, players on the
bench would throw their arms up
in disbelief.
With 4:45'remaining in the game,
sophomore forward Matt Rust went
in alone on Volkening and had the
junior netminder beaten with his
patented forehand-to-backhand
move. But the shot went off the
high post. As he watched the puck
bounce into the opposite corner,
moments of the meet came during
the 1,650-yard freestyle. As senior
co-captain Matt Patton stepped on
the block for his last race as a Wol-
verine, the entire Michigan team
lined up along the pool deck and
cheered him on for his 14-plus min-
ute race. He finished first in his heat
and swam his best time by three sec-
onds. While the parents in the stands
and his teammates whistled, cheered
and clapped, the notoriously quiet
Patton simply nodded his head and
pointed his finger toward his team.
Patton's sixth-place finish earned
him All-American honors.
Though the Wolverines had ini-
tially hoped for a top-four finish after
finishing sixth last season, Patton
said the team's entire season mustbe
considered in order to put the team's
performance at this meet into per-
spective.
"There are so many things we as
a team had to overcome," he said.

Rust raised his arms above his
waist, as if someone had just played
a joke on him.
Facing elimination with two
minutes left, freshman defense-
man Brandon Burlon received a
quick pass at the point and saw
Volkening out of position, giving
way to an open net. After the shot
whizzed over the crossbar, Burlon
turned and cocked his stick behind
his head, ready to slam it on the ice
before he remembered play was still
going on.
As the shots continued to hit
everything but the back of the net,
Berenson's hands were tied. What
does a coach tell his players when
everything is going their way,
except on scoreboard?
"It's not a matter of working
hard," Berenson said. "It's about
working smart, doing the things
that got us here, moving the puck
wide. We're a good team when we
use our outside speed and go to the
net, and we had trouble getting past
their D."
Ultimately, it was a lack of puck-
luck that doomed the Wolverines.
And for all his concerns heading
into the game, Serratore would
finally be able to get some sleep.
"We lost our best swimmer, really,
when (Scott Spann) transferred to
Texas. We graduated a two-time
NCAA champion (Alex Vanderkaay),
and we lost our coach (Bob Bow-
man). But we all swam better than
last year, and that defines what this
year's team was all about."
Taking some time to reflect at the
end of his first season as Michigan's
coach, Bottom said he was happy
with the team's development but
called the meet "very educational"
for his own approach to coaching.
"This year has been a time where
I've sat and watched and next year
is going to be a time of action," Bot-
tom said. "The guys will be seeing
a different Mike. The team will be
reminded daily about what this meet
was like. It gave them all a new per-
spective on their swimming, but if
we are going to be the team I know
we can be, they need to be reminded
of this experience every day."

lose the game for Michigan, by any

you have the CCHA's best offense,
two goals feel like a paper cut, not
FALCONS

Multi-line scoring was the
Wolverines' mantra, and it
worked for a while. They even
found success for two periods
against Notre Dame last weekend
- their two-goal lead came from
their first and third lines.
But despite outshooting Air
Force by 30 shots Friday, Michi-
gan came up empty. It tallied 43
shots on Volkening. It dominated
time of possession, even posting
a stretch of almost four minutes
where the puck didn't leave the
Air Force zone. Friday's game
marked the sixth time this sea-
son in which Michigan outshot
its opponent but lost the game.
The Wolverines demonstrated
the speed, skills and playmaking
ability to win the game, but their
luck ran out against a white-hot
goaltender.
"We got 40-some shots, we
probably had 10 or 12 Grade-
A scoring chances," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said. "That's
the most you're going to get in
any game. We didn't capitalize
on them. Then their goalie played
a terrific game. It's as simple as
that.
"Somebody told me a long time
ago, when you get to this tour-
nament, the team with the best
goalie wins."
His team echoed many of his
sentiments after the season-end-
ing defeat.
Sophomore forward Aaron

-Eisenstein will still bein D.C.
for the Frozen Four because he's
going home for Passover. He can be

Palushaj said it was quite appar-
ent that the Wolverines out-
played Air Force - the bounces
just didn't go their way.
Sophomore forward Matt Rust
said he and his teammates had
enough scoring chances to win
the game, but running into a
hot goalie made the task nearly
impossible.
Junior co-captain Chris
Summers, who usually cracks
light-hearted jokes at press con-
ferences, gave short, one-word
answers to reporters after Fri-
day's game. When asked how he
felt following the loss, Summers
simply glowered. His deadly glare
seemed to showcase a variety of
emotions - from anger to disap-
pointment to sadness.
And there's no doubt that, on
paper, the loss was shocking. A
No. 4 seed knocked off a No. 1
seed. Air Force, a team that had-
never won a tournament game,
beat Michigan, a team with nine
NCAA Championship titles.
It would have been easy for
the Wolverines to overlook the
lowly Falcons. It would have been
easy for them to chalk it up as a
crazy upset. But for Berenson, it
was neither. He stood firm, stat-
ing repeatedly that his team had
been well-prepared.
"We expected a tough game,
so this wasn't an upset," Beren-
son said. "This was a real good
Air Force team. ... I can tell you,
(my) team did not look ahead. We
put everything we had into this
game, and the puck just didn't go
in."

the overall team standings with 248
points, with Auburn winning the
national title (526). It was the Wol-
verines' ninth consecutive top-10
NCAA finish.
The meet got off to an unfamiliar
start for Michigan. The majority of
the team's races ended with personal-
best times and even school records,
but after the prelims for many events,
several Wolverines found themselves
watching the finals from the bleach-
ers instead of swimming in them.
Bottom said his team was "shell-
shocked" by the meet's intense com-
petition. But Michigan pointed to
junior Chris Brady's butterfly leg
of the 200-yard medley relay at the
start of day two as a turning point.
"To be honest, we were a little
down after the first day," freshman

Dan Madwed said. "Mike told us
we weren't swimming as well as we
should be, and when we saw Chris
had the fastest butterfly leg of any
relay, it really inspired us all to do
well."
And the Wolverines, led by Clary,
did finish strong. Clary won a second
individual NCAA championship and
set another NCAA record in the 200-
yard backstroke, becoming the first
Wolverine to win the national title in
that event since Ed Bartsch in 1963.
He was also named national Swim-
mer of the Year at the conclusion of
the meet.
Madwed finished 12th in the 200-
yard freestyle, and Brady set schools
records as he took fourth in the 100-
yard butterfly and the 400-yard
freestyle relay, consisting of senior
co-captain Bobby Savulich, Brady,
Clary and redshirt senior Evan
Ryser.
