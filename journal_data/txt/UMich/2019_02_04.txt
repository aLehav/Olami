On Feb. 1, the city of Ann Arbor 
awarded a $15,000 Sustaining 
Ann Arbor Together grant to A2 
STEAM at Northside Elementary 
School. The school will use the 
grant to fund the implementation 
of a solar curriculum for students 
in kindergarten through eighth 
grade to support educational 
efforts about clean energy and its 
use.
During the 2017-2018 school 
year, students at A2 STEAM began 
fundraising for the installation 
of 60 solar panels at the school 
and created the Solar at STEAM 
Project. Now that they have 
raised enough money to install 
the solar panels, the school wants 
to use the SA2T grant to educate 
students on solar power through 

a comprehensive, project-based 
curriculum.
Jean Wilson, an A2 STEAM at 
Northside science teacher, pursued 
the grant. With a self-proclaimed 
passion for sustainability, Wilson 
said she hopes the grant will help 
educate her students about the 
effects of climate change and 
make a positive impact on the Ann 
Arbor community.
“I’m hoping that we create a 
sustainability mindset where kids 
are really thinking about their use. 
It’s hard to ask people to conserve 
when they’re not already thinking 
about how much they use, and it’s 
hard for that to be the first step,” 
Wilson said.

A picture is all that is left of 
the Michigan, a World War II 
B-24 bomber plane with the 
University of Michigan’s iconic 
football stadium painted on its 
nose.
Ray Hunter, chairman of 
the 
Yankee 
Air 
Museum’s 
board of directors, explained 
the museum’s initiative to 
unearth information regarding 
the aircraft. The museum is 
located in Willow Run Airport 
in Belleville, Mich.
“We’ve had photos at the 
Yankee Air Museum of this 
aircraft for a lot of years,” 
Hunter said. “And we tried 
several years ago to find out 
if we could ever find anybody 
who flew on the airplane or 
was a crew member or worked 
on it in some way.”
The museum came up short, 
unable to unearth the history 
of the Michigan.
Hunter and the Yankee Air 
Museum are seeking a story 
about the Michigan in an 
attempt to compile more World 
War II history for future 
generations of ROTC cadets to 
learn from.
“Next year is the 75th 
anniversary of the cessation 
of World War II,” Hunter said. 
“Most of the crew members 
on World War II aircrafts are 
90-something. 
It’s 
unlikely 
that we’ll find a crew member, 
but we might find one of their 
families. That’s what we’re 

really looking for.”
The Yankee Air Museum 
is invested in preserving first 
hand accounts of American 
military history. Hunter said 
that they often host veterans 
of every discipline, each with 
tales of their own lives to 
share.
“They all have tremendous 
stories to tell,” Hunter said.
Hunter said the University 
is rich with stories, many of 

which intertwine with those 
of the Air Force and American 
military.
“We know that at least one or 
many more of the people on the 
Michigan served in World War 
II,” Hunter said. “But beyond 
that, thousands of University 
of Michigan students served in 
World War II.”
Like many of its kind, the 
plane was melted down for its 
metal following the end of the 

war.
“It’s kind of ironic because 
during World War II, a lot 
of families were asked to 
donate their pots and pans 
so they could be turned into 
airplanes,” Hunter said. “Then 
after the war, airplanes were 
melted down and turned back 
into pots and pans.”

Following 
record 
low 
temperatures and a Consumers 
Energy alert to lower thermostats 
on Wednesday and Thursday, 
thousands of Michigan residents 
faced possible harm due to lack 
of heating and other necessary 
resources.
The emergency alert came 
after a fire broke out at the utility’s 
Consumers 
Ray 
Natural 
Gas 
Compressor Station in Macomb 
County on Wednesday morning. 
As a result, the company urged 
customers to reduce their natural 
gas usage to conserve energy.
On Thursday, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer held a press conference 
with members of her cabinet, 
addressing the people of Michigan 
about 
her 
administration’s 
multilateral 
response 
to 
the 
problems faced during the past 
week.
Representatives 
from 
the 
National 
Weather 
Service, 
Department of Transportation and 
Michigan state troopers attended 
the meeting.

Local politicians gather to choose leadership, discuss strategy for upcoming year

The Michigan Democratic Party 
held its annual convention Saturday 
at the Cobo Center in Detroit. 
Politicians from across the state, 
regional and federal governments 
emphasized unity while laying the 
groundwork for 2020.

The state’s top Democratic office 
holders gave speeches, including Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin 
Gilchrist II and Attorney General 
Dana Nessel. 
Gilchrist highlighted the necessity 
of building a foundation for successful 
organizing in the coming year.
“The work of organizing is an 
everyday, an eternal enterprise,” 

Gilchrist said. “I need every one of 
you to keep organizing as well. I 
don’t think we have enough voters in 
Michigan. We have 10 million people 
in Michigan and more of them need 
to vote. You know how we make that 
happen? We make that happen by 
starting right now.”
Attendees 
included 
delegates 
from a variety of districts across the 

state. In the morning, congressional 
districts and interest groups hosted 
caucuses - a meeting of supporters 
dedicated to a specific political 
movement - including the Progressive 
Caucus, the LGBT & A Caucus and 
the Environmental Caucus.

More than 200 students and

night in celebration of the 10th

the 
unique struggles Malaysians 
of different ethnicities faced 
during the British colonial 
period, which began in the 
early 1500s and lasted until 
Malaysia became independent 
in 1957.
The event opened with a 
dance to the Malay song “Dikir 
Puteri” and culminated in a 
play by MiMSA members. The 
play followed the lives of three 
characters from three different 
ethnic groups — Malaysian, 
Indian and Chinese — to 
show how immigration and 
animosity toward those viewed 
as “other” impact a person’s 
sense of belonging.

Educator 
and 
activist 
Yavilah 
McCoy 
joined 
Michigan Hillel for a Shabbat 
dinner on Friday to talk about 
social activism and the role 
Judaism plays in activism. 
The 
event, 
“Courageous 
Conversation Towards Equity 
and Empowerment for All 
Students,” was one of a series of 
events that took place Feb. 1-3 
with McCoy as Hillel’s Scholar 
in Residence for the weekend. 
McCoy 
is 
the 
CEO 
of 
Dimensions 
Educational 
Counseling, Inc., a nonprofit 
led by women and Jewish 
people of color which consults 

and 
trains 
on 
diversity, 
equity and inclusion. She also 
founded Ayecha, a nonprofit 
organization that advocates 
for Jewish people of color and 
provides support for Jewish 
and 
multiracial 
families. 
McCoy spoke at Hillel in 
2017 and is a member of 
the leadership and steering 
committee for the Women’s 
March. 
McCoy 
focused 
on 
the 
interplay 
between 
different 
aspects of her identity at the 
discussion Friday.
“I’m an African-American, 
Jewish 
woman, 
and 
I’ve 
lived for many years saying 
I’m unapologetic about my 
identity,” McCoy said. “So 

freedom, the idea of liberalism 
is always in front of me.”
Students gathered in the 
main lounge of Hillel after a 
dinner with McCoy. McCoy 
began the talk by teaching them 
a song in the Jewish gospel, 
singing 
“Shabbat 
Shalom” 
and having attendees respond 
singing the same words.
McCoy said people sing 
because it brings courage. 
She said activists often sing 
and chant in marches to bring 
about more courage. 
McCoy explained the four 
levels of courage: personal, 
interpersonal, 
system 
or 
institutional 
and 
cultural. 
Through examples of leaders 
showing courage, she said 
oftentimes 
acts 
of 
courage 
transcend 
all 
four levels. The examples 
she provided included the 
gymnasts who spoke out 
against Larry Nassar and 
Starbucks closing stores 
to provide racial bias 
training 
to 
employees. 
McCoy pointed out that 
in 
both 
cases, 
those 
acting with courage faced 
several risks.
“What’s 
at 
stake 
around having courage?” 
she asked. “It’s not just 
about you and me. There’s 
huge losses that can come 
as a result of a lack of 
courage.” 
The 
conversation 
transitioned into small 
group discussions, where 
McCoy 
had 
attendees 
break 
into 
pairs 
to 
analyze a Jewish religious 
text. The discussion style 
was in the chavruta form, 
a 
traditional 
rabbinic 
approach where pairs of 
students 
examine 
and 
debate Jewish texts. 

An 
overarching 
concept 
of chavruta is that no single 
person 
ever 
has 
a 
full 
understanding of any idea. 
Using 
the 
text, 
attendees 
discussed which characters 
in stories were perpetrators 
of violence and which were 
targets, bystanders and allies.
LSA senior Ali Rosenblatt 
has heard McCoy speak three 
times and was part of the 
student committee at Hillel 
who organized the talk. One 
of her key takeaways from 
the discussion was the idea of 
people playing different roles in 
social justice situations and the 
importance of joining together 
with other communities to 
address social justice issues.
“At any one time, we’re not 
just the perpetrator, target or 
bystander,” Rosenblatt said. 
“It’s something I recognized 
and want to bring more into the 
Jewish community. How do we 
get students to talk more about 
issues affecting non-Jewish 
communities and not just the 
Jewish community? And how 
can we work together with 
these communities?”
When debriefing as a group, 
attendees pointed out people 
could play multiple roles in 
conflicts, often not realizing 
they could be a perpetrator and 
an ally at the same time. McCoy 
agreed and said leadership 
requires courage to make the 
right choices in defending 
personal beliefs, especially if 
it means going against cultural 
norms. McCoy said this was 
especially relevant today in 
a world she believes is led by 
leaders oppressing those with 
less power.

Founded on the mission for 
Latinx students to reclaim, uplift 
and properly represent the Latinx 
community, Latinidad is a new 
magazine that is forging its ways 
among the intersection of creative 
expression and social justice. 
LSA seniors Jacqueline Delgado 
and Daniel Lopez developed the 
vision of Latinidad after searching 
through the University’ archives 
for Latinx representation and 
initiative. While Delgado and 
Lopez knew that Latinx students 
have 
contributed 
immensely 
to crafting the legacy of the 
University of Michigan, they also 
knew that evidence of these efforts 
were not as largely celebrated or 
recognized.
Most of these efforts were 
rooted in the Raza Art and Media 
Collective in 1974, a publication 
founded to spotlight and archive 
Latinx 
art 
through 
various 
mediums. This was especially 
revolutionary as it came about in a 

particularly harsh political climate 
and when Latinx voices were 
largely silenced in the Midwest. 
The 
journal 
only 
published 
four issues from 1976-1977, but 
Latinidad has decided to pick up 
the initiative in molding a space 
for Latinx students to preserve 

and culminate their experiences. 
Latinidad 
released 
their 
first issue, “On the Border of 
Humanity,” in December 2018. 
This 
issue 
reloved 
around 
individual 
connections 
to 
humanizing 
immigration, 
the 
experiences as diverse as the 
vastness of Latin America. The 
magazine featured an expansive 
range of mediums, including 
poetry, personal narratives, art 
pieces, vignettes and photos. 
Latinidad prides itself on its 
collaborative 
process, 
which 
prioritizes all contributor’s voices 
in deciding each issue’s key theme.
Engineering 
senior 
Natalia 
Madrigal Martinez is an artist 
whose 
work 
is 
featured 
in 
Latinidad. 
In 
Latinidad, 
her 
contribution is in the form of a 
captivating painting, which she 
gave the title “La Frontera” to 
highlight the hypocrisies of the 
political conflict regarding the 
US-Mexico border. 
When 
asked 
about 
the 
inspiration behind her piece, she 
said, “I was born in Mexico. I felt 
like I had to paint the division 
between 
our 
two 
countries 
because originally, this was all one 
land. The Mexicas and the Aztecs 
controlled this land called Azland. 

That 
was 
Mexican 
territory 
until the mid 1800s. So, I wanted 
to paint the broad difference 
between how Mexico and the US 
before, these free lands,where 
indigenous people were able to 
roam 
and 
appreciate 
nature. 
Now, it’s just this ugly, gross, soul-

sucking border,” Martinez said.
LSA sophomore Ana María 
Sánchez-Castillo 
offered 
a 
reflection of her featured piece, 
“Prophetic 
Peregrination.” 
In 
addition to her position as an 
editor 
at 
The 
Daily, 
Latinidad is 
one of her 
primary 
outlets 
for 
self-
expression 
and 
creativity.
“To 
me 
Latiniada 
means 
community 
and 
the 
concept 
of 
supporting 
each 
other 
and 
supporting 
each other’s’ 
dreams and 
ambitions 
through that 
support and 
through this 
support, we can accomplish things 
in a system that wasn’t designed 
for us,” Sanchez-Castillo said. 
After 
a 
critically 
received 
first launch, Latinidad released 
their second issue in January, 
“Cultivacion: 
Cultivating 
our 
Humanity,” revolving around the 

distinct experiences within the 
Latinx identity with future plans 
to release a third edition. 
Founder Jacqueline Delgado 
had nothing but gratitude and high 
energy to offer as she elaborated 
on the outpour of community 
support. 
“I feel really proud. I’m at 
the forefront of a big moment 
happening,” Delgado said. 
Latinidad, 
by 
its 
very 
existence, 
is 
a 
revolutionary 
platform. 
Past 
initiatives 
to 
highlight 
Latinx 
involvement 
have struggled due to lack of 
institutional support. However, 
Latinidad is the accumulation 
of generations worth of student, 
faculty and community efforts 
to archive, preserve and uplift 
the diverse representations of 
Latinx identities. Combined with 
intentional intellectual, creative 
and community investment, it is 
clear that Latinidad is set for a path 
of success and flourishing. 
Latinidad is steadily building its 
prominence, and the momentum 
will not be stopping anytime 
soon. Currently, content is bring 
primarily produced electronically 
with hopes to see every issue 
have a print release. Latinidad 
will continue their efforts with 
an event titled “Latinx Journey 
in College” on March 22. Anyone 
interested in reading the issues 
of Latinidad can do so on their 
website.

Dearborn is like an Arab Bazaar, 
filled with people from all walks of 
life. There are people from Yemen, 
Iraq, Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Syria 
and more. However, every bazaar 
has its issues. Sometimes, the 
customers fight and the vendors 
don’t get along. Ultimately, this leads 
to the bazaar falling apart. Dearborn 
is like this because of the prejudice 
that clouds our eyes and judgment. 
We get along well enough, but there 
are underlying tensions straining 
our relationships with one another. 
I believe this to be the single most 
important issue in my community 
because it leaves us divided and 
vulnerable. As a community filled 
with minorities, we must unite, set 
aside our differences, and learn 
to love our fellow community 
members. In this case, education is 
the solution and great equalizer for 
our people.
There are ethnic clashes between 
the Lebanese, Yemenis, and Iraqis, 
and I have yet to understand why. 
Our cultures differ slightly, but that 
does not stop the dirty looks that 
these groups continue to give one 
another. These looks can stop once 
we educate ourselves on current 
events. We can look at a news 
broadcast and view the immensity 
that one’s hateful actions has on the 
people they encounter. Hate crimes 
and vengefulness consume the 
souls of our fellow human beings. 
Wars encompass the Middle East, 
and that leaves me wondering: 
Does Dearborn really want to be as 
divided as our origin countries? In 
America, where we have just barely 
started out, we cannot afford to be 

divided. Education teaches us that 
unification between people leads to 
an era of peace, economic growth, 
and overall prosperity. We need 
only look towards the future and 
not the past. Education encourages 
innovation and new ideas, something 
Dearborn needs to flourish.
Education 
is 
a 
vehicle 
for 
change because all throughout my 
educational career I have learned 
and witnessed the consequences 
of prejudice. It ignites genocide, 
injustice, and senseless actions that 
harm innocent people. However, this 
hate-filled seed can only be planted 
if people do not have faith and trust 
in one another. Faith and trust seem 
doable in Dearborn because everyone 
is everyone’s long-lost cousin, but 
at this point, our ethnicities don’t 
mix, we look down on our Detroit 
neighbors and we argue over what 
is halal or haram. Education would 
remedy this issue in many ways. 
Speaking from personal experience, 
learning alongside people that are 
different from me makes me see that 
we are all humans with different 
exteriors. Intellectual conversations 
and debates stimulate our minds 
and form a sense of camaraderie 
between us. We learn to not grow 
up to become Hitler’s Germany or 
Reconstruction Era America. Rather, 
we aim to be a community fighting 
for one another’s rights and equality 
like the 1960’s Civil Rights era.
Dearborn is a safe haven for 
us Middle Easterns, but we must 
welcome 
everyone 
into 
our 
community no matter their race, 
ethnicity, or religion. By educating 
ourselves with the past, we can 
embrace our differences in the 
future.
 

I was miserable. Hot, sweaty, 
feverish, and just about ready to 
cry.
And I did.
“Do you think I could just sit 
out of class today?” I croaked, 
feeling the cold sweat squirm 
down the base of my neck.
“If you really feel so bad, why 
don’t you just go to the nurse 
and then go home for the day?” 
My gym instructor’s eyebrows 
were raised in a condescending 
arch as she stared at me with an 
airy disdain.
“I--I can’t…” I said in a vague 
manner. “I have to stay at school 
for the day.”
By 
some 
extraordinary 
capacity, my teacher’s eyebrows 
bunched up even higher than 
they were before. Short, stout, 
and wary-looking, she cast her 
eyes downwards on me with a 
tiring suspicion.
“Is it because your mom is a 
tiger mom?”
I paused my sniveling. Where 
did that come from?
“Like does your mom not let 
you come home from school 
because you need to be present 
in order to learn and get good 
grades and all? You know?”
This time it was my eyebrows 
performing 
supernatural 
physical feats.
“No. She’s not.” I said flatly.
I didn’t bother furthering my 
plea to sit out anymore. I got up, 
changed into my uniform, and 
in a hazy exhaustion, completed 
the physical activities with the 

rest of my classmates.
Years later, I find myself 
wondering whether she was 
right. Was my mom a tiger mom? 
How angry would my parents 
have been if they found out that 
I had left school on account of 
being “sick”? I remember the 
reason I insisted on staying at 
school for the rest of the day: 
my rebellious teenager pride 
and fear of embarrassment. 
I 
hadn’t 
listened 
to 
my 
mom when she insisted that 
wearing my new, Black Friday 
“discounted”, semi-sheer long 
sleeve from Hollister amidst 
the negative wind chill ravaging 
the outdoors that winter was 
going to get me sick. And for 
that, I had felt too foolish and 
ashamed to go home.
Now, that wasn’t the first 
time I had been asked “casually” 
about my parents’ parenting 
style. To my fourteen-year old 
self, the phrase “tiger mom” 
was nothing new. Neither was 
hearing about how I must be 
naturally smart, secretly eating 
dog for dinner or aspiring to 
become a doctor one day. What 
was new to me that day in gym 
class was that the conversation 
came from an adult figure. For 
the first, but most definitely 
not last, time in my life, a fully 
grown 
individual 
dropped 
racially-charged questions on 
me.
So, 
today 
I 
want 
to 
deconstruct the “tiger mom.” 
What it means, what it doesn’t 
mean, and what it means to me.
A tiger mom is known to 
be 
aggressive. 
Overbearing. 
Unreasonably 
strict. 
She 

is 
pictured 
hovering 
above 
her 
daughter, 
controlling 
the tempo for little Jenny’s 
piano practice session. She is 
imagined micromanaging the 
kids of the household, stowing 
away 
all 
electronics 
and 
monitoring 
homework 
time. 
She is envisioned restricting 
her children from hanging out 
with their friends and attending 
social events. She is no fun. She 
is too harsh. She is, in essence, a 
Chinese woman.
So let me tell you a little bit 
about my mom. Her name is 
Zhuping, but she sometimes 
goes by Virginia. She has the 
sweetest smile, with these soft 
laugh lines that can tell any 
onlooker how much love she 
has in her life. She has brown 
eyes that twinkle in her joys and 
baby moles that decorate her 
face. She is beautiful, kind, and 
most important of all, strong.
Don’t get me wrong though. 
She can also be aggressive. If 
I ever find myself in a verbal 
argument with her, I know that 
my best choice is to stay silent 
because my mom can talk my 
ear off for ages. She can be 
overbearing too. Sometimes she 
brings up so many questions, 
to-do’s, things to give me, or 
articles of clothing to make me 
wear, that it makes my head 
want to explode. And at times, 
she can be oddly strict. Can I 
open this chocolate cake from 
Trader Joe’s? No. Not unless I 
get an explicit go-ahead. But 
I know that all of these are 
because my mom has a loving 
heart. It’s hard to understand 
sometimes, but with time and 

perspective, I have grown to 
know how amazing of a person 
she really is. Every now and 
then, she yells at me without 
end so that I can be the best 
version of myself, so that I 
can be the responsible, young 
woman she raised me to be. She 
asks me over and over if I want 
this, or if I need to do this, or 
if I would please wear this so I 
won’t get sick, and I know she 

hovers so often because she 
cares about me. She tells me 
not to eat the cake because she’s 
actually saving it for someone 
else, a family she’s going to visit 
over the weekend. She has a 
heart of gold. It manifests itself 
in different ways -- it manifests 
itself in tiger mom ways, but 
they’re all really just a testimony 
to how deep the love, care, and 
generosity she has for others, 
including her children, go.
But 
what 
parent 
is 
not 
aggressive, overbearing, or strict 
to a certain degree? Parents 
take care of their children with 
a ferocious love, just like a tiger 
does with her cubs. Just like any 
actual tiger mom.
My mom is a tiger. She is 
a tiger because she is fierce. 
She is a tiger because she has 
never quit teaching me this 
lifelong 
lesson 
of 
strength, 
independence, 
power, 
and 
resilience. She is a tiger because 
she encourages me to defy, to 
push back against the world, 
and to stand up for my own 
being. This is what a tiger mom 
really is. This is my tiger mom. 
And I wouldn’t have it any other 
way.

(Fair warning: I’ll be including 
spoilers for previous seasons of Mr. 
Robot from here on out.)
With the fourth season of Mr. 
Robot coming up, I wanted to take 
a critical look at how it’s done with 
representation. In many ways, Mr. 
Robot has been uncommonly good 
at portraying diverse characters. 
The protagonist Elliot Alderson 
(played 
by 
Egyptian-American 
actor Rami Malek) comes from a 
multiracial family and navigates 
mental illness through psychiatric 
means. Even Elliot’s ragtag team 
of anarchist hackers – aptly named 
“fsociety” – is a racially diverse 
group. However, the show also 
has its failings, one of which its 
portrayal of Chinese characters.
In order to engineer an economic 
revolution, fsociety joins forces with 
the Dark Army, a group of hackers 
hailing from China. The leader of 
the Dark Army is whiterose (played 
by B.D. Wong), a transgender 
woman who remains closeted, 
choosing 
to 
publicly 
present 
herself as Zhang, the male Chinese 
Minister of Defense.
Whiterose’s righthand man is 
named Grant (played by Grant 
Chang), and he is always by her 
side, with the exception of when 
he is doing her bidding. Grant and 
whiterose also share a romantic 
relationship that complements their 
professional relationship.
And that’s where the problems 
start.
Professionally, though he is her 
subordinate, she treats him with 
respect, even inquiring after his 
opinion about how to proceed, 
whether it is as the leader of the 
Dark Army or as Minister Zhang. 
Romantically, the atmosphere is a 
far cry from this mutual respect. 
She dominates him entirely. Though 
she does feel for him, their power 
dynamic even within the context of 
the personal relationship appears to 
be radically uneven.
As assistant to the chief of 
the Dark Army, Grant’s status is 
visually evident: his ever-present 
business suits and the expensive 
cars and bodyguards that follow 
him everywhere. Yet Grant is 
emasculated heavily, especially in 
his last conversation with Irving 
(played by Bobby Cannavale) in the 
final episode of season three.
Though a long-time fixer for 
the Dark Army, Irving decides to 

suddenly quit. Grant confronts 
him, but Irving shuts him down 
by saying, “Tell me something. 
She still making her spontaneous 
overtures? She make you taste her 
yet? Remember, doll face, I was you 
years ago. And I’ve already done 
my time. I think she’ll be good with 
me.”
From this, we can tell that Grant 
is only whiterose’s latest fancy. All 
of his supposed power seems to 
stems from his close relationship 
and association with whiterose, 
not his own merits. Worse yet, 
whiterose’s advances have clearly 
not all been consensual or at least, 
at some point, ceased to be so in 
Irving’s case. This portrays her as 
a predator who turns subordinates 
into her playthings in exchange for 
promotions: a classic case of sexual 
harassment in the workplace.
So what does all this have to do 
with Grant and whiterose’s status 
as Chinese characters?
The Chinese have long been 
accused of “deviant” sexuality, in 
no small part due to the history of 
exoticism surrounding them. In 
19th century America, Chinese 
men were ousted from the physical 
fields, and the law only allowed 
them to take on work in areas that 
had traditionally been considered 
feminine, such as laundry. Through 
their employment, they blurred 
gender lines, with the predictable 
result of coming to be considered 
less masculine than other men. 
Chinese 
men 
are 
stereotyped 
as submissives in relationships 
– which is also one of two common 
stereotypes that has been applied 
to Chinese women, especially in 
media.
The other stereotype of Chinese 
women is as aggressive, dominant 
women with mysterious sexual 
charms. They’re considered to be 
controlling and sly, so much so, 
that this stereotype has earned 
the name of “Dragon Lady”. In her 
relationship with Grant, whiterose 
epitomizes this stereotype with 
her domineering behavior. While 
the Dragon Lady can also positively 
represent 
Chinese 
women 
as 
assertive and independent, in this 
case, it only further emasculates 
Chinese men.
Despite this, I’m looking forward 
to seeing what Mr. Robot brings for 
its final season. Hopefully, in terms 
of the Dark Army and its Chinese 
characters, it’ll be a departure from 
outmoded stereotypes.

T

his 
past 
November, 

Israel 
faced 
an 

unfortunate 
and 
oft-

repeated event as the country 

was hit by a barrage of attacks 

by Hamas militants in the 

Gaza Strip. The majority were 

intercepted by the Iron Dome 

missile 
defense 
system, 
but 

many also hit Israeli towns and 

cities close to Gaza, including 

the port city of Ashkelon. After 

one attack, one person in the city 

was killed: A 48-year-old man 

named Mahmoud Abu Asabeh 

who lived in a small town on the 

West Bank.

Abu Asabeh, a man who had 

called for an end to the violence, 

was in Israel on a work permit 

and died after a rocket hit his 

apartment. Israeli firefighters 

searched 
the 
building 
and 

evacuated others, but he wasn’t 

found until an hour later and 

succumbed to his injuries. Now, 

according to The Times of Israel, 

his family is now suing the state 

of Israel and its rescue services 

for 
10 
million 
New 
Israeli 

shekels, the equivalent of $2.7 

million, claiming negligence and 

seeking reparations from the 

government.

On 
platforms 
from 
the 

United 
Nations 
to 
college 

campuses, 
Israel 
has 
been 

accused 
of 
implementing 

an unequal treatment of its 

minority citizens and, more 

broadly, those who are not 

Jewish. Yet in this short and sad 

story — which remains largely 

not covered by many media 

outlets 
— 
important 
truths 

about the Jewish state become 

apparent to those following the 

event.

Developments in this story 

have revealed the remarkable 

fact that the Israeli judicial 

system — often accused by critics 

for 
discriminating 
against 

Israel’s 
minorities 
— 
allows 

Palestinian Arabs to sue Israel in 

a court of law. Neither the terror 

victim nor his family held Israeli 

citizenship or residency, apart 

from his approved work permit 

for temporary stay in Ashkelon, 

and yet they were allowed a 

legal privilege that could have 

otherwise been reserved for 

Israelis. Furthermore, if the 

case continues to move through 

the courts, it may be heard by 

many Arab judges of Christian 

and Muslim faith in the Israeli 

circuit, including George Karra, 

an Arab justice on the Supreme 

Court of Israel. This reality is a 

stark contrast to the widespread 

claims 
of 
mistreatment 
of 

Arabs in Israeli courts, and 

the insistence of groups such 

as the Palestinian Authority 

that, because Israel is a Jewish 

nation, it is institutionally racist 

or discriminatory toward its 

minority Arab population.

The Times of Israel also 

reported that the Jewish Agency 

for Israel, an organization that 

was created for the support of 

Israeli and world Jewry, has 

pledged to financially aid Abu 

Asabeh’s family through their 

Fund for Victims of Terror. The 

fund is intended for use by all 

Israeli citizens, regardless of 

religious or ethnic background. 

This 
action 
is 
even 
more 

substantial because the Jewish 

Agency will be using these 

resources to not only come to 

the aid of a Muslim family, but 

a family that lives in the West 

Bank. Yet the terror attack 

happened in Israel, and thus 

this Jewish-Israeli organization 

was on hand to assist. A deed 

such as this speaks volumes 

to the efforts of Israel — not 

only by its government, but its 

society — to pursue fairness and 

justice in their dealings. If Israel 

really did not care about its 

non-Jewish citizens, residents 

or even temporary workers, the 

Jewish Agency would not extend 

itself in this manner to help a 

Palestinian family in need.

Nevertheless, 
many 
in 

politics, 
journalism 
and 

academia 
still 
continue 
to 

perpetuate the myth that Israel 

is an apartheid state that is only 

concerned with the fortunes 

of Jewish citizens, and regard 

Arabs as second-class citizens. 

In Michigan alone, the charge 

has been levied across all parts 

of society, from newly-elected 

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib to 

professors at the University 

of Michigan. They claim that 

because of the disputed Israeli 

presence in the West Bank, and 

because Israel has designated 

themselves as a distinctly Jewish 

state, those who are not Jewish 

face a disadvantage. However, 

every detail of this ongoing 

case proves these claims to be 

falsehoods. After a rocket attack 

by Gazan-Palestinians, a family 

of Muslim Arabs, citizens under 

the Palestinian Authority in the 

West Bank, received the same 

legal rights and relief privileges 

as Israeli citizens, both Jewish 

and 
of 
other 
backgrounds. 

They will be supported by an 

organization founded to support 

the welfare of Jewish people 

and the Jewish state, but is 

clearly committed to upholding 

the equality that makes Israel 

unique.

When 
one 
takes 
an 

honest look at the region, it 

is immediately apparent that 

Israel is the only country in the 

Middle East with a tolerant and 

equal society for minorities. 

A December 2017 study by 

the Taub Center for Social 

Policy Studies in Israel found 

Israeli-Arabs had the highest 

life expectancy among Arab 

populations from all countries 

in the Muslim world, at 79 years 

(though this is low compared to 

the Jewish population at 82.7 

years and the OECD average 

of 81.6 years). In addition, 

Israel is one of just a handful 

of countries in the region in 

which the Christian population 

is 
growing. 
In 
surrounding 

states, the outlook for ethnic 

and religious minorities is bleak 

at best. Christians in Egypt and 

Syria have faced persecution 

for years now, as extremists and 

the tyrannical regime of Syrian 

President 
Bashar 
Al-Assad 

have caused their rights to be 

reduced and civilians to be 

killed. In contrast, Israel is a 

refuge in which Jews, Muslims 

and Christians all enjoy civil 

and religious liberties on a scale 

of equality not seen elsewhere 

in the Middle East.

Unfortunately, 
this 

approach to equality — and the 

commitment to all citizens — 

is not shared by the leadership 

of the Palestinian Authority. 

President 
Mahmoud 
Abbas 

has expressed repeatedly that 

he does not want “a single 

Israeli — civilian or soldier” in 

a potential future Palestinian 

state 
within 
the 
pre-1967 

borders, making his disdain 

for them known. In addition, 

according to Times of Israel , 

“No senior Fatah or PA officials 

attended the burial service” 

for Abu Asabeh in November, 

but a month prior when it was 

suspected that Israeli settlers 

killed a Palestinian, many of 

these officials “took part” in 

the funeral. Since Abu Asabeh’s 

death could not be blamed 

on Israel, to Fatah, there was 

apparently no need to pay its 

respects to its grieving citizens.

In these statements and 

actions 
from 
Palestinian 

leadership, both an intolerance 

toward others and a stunning 

lack of empathy run prevalent. 

In Israel, a multi-religious Arab 

minority — which comprises 

just over 20 percent of the 

population — is given full rights 

and liberty. In the West Bank, 

Jews are given an ultimatum: 

If a Palestinian state is created, 

leave or risk your freedom and 

lives.

Those 
who 
seek 
justice 

and fairness in politics and 

reporting must acknowledge 

Israel’s efforts and success in 

creating a bastion of liberal 

democracy in a Middle East 

filled with extremism and rife 

with persecution. The story 

of Mahmoud Abu Asabeh and 

his family — though heart-

wrenching to its core — is a 

reminder of what makes the 

Jewish state worth defending 

for anyone who truly cares 

about 
the 
advancement 
of 

humanity around the globe. 

Israel provides and prioritizes 

civil rights in a region that has 

been historically and presently 

devoid of leadership that cares 

about 
democratic 
values. 

Even while under siege from a 

barrage of rockets and terrorist 

attacks, 
Israel 
provides 
an 

opportunity for people like 

the Abu Asabeh family to hold 

Israeli government and rescue 

services accountable in a court 

of law for accused negligence 

and untimeliness. Herein lies 

just one reason why Israel is 

inspiring and worth defending. 

Supporting its well-being and 

existence is in the moral and 

strategic interest of the United 

States and all those who work 

towards the cause of freedom 

worldwide.

A Who’s Who on the Democratic Primary Race

W

hile it may be hard to 
believe we have just 
barely made it past 

two complete years 
of the Donald Trump 
presidency, Democrats 
are desperately trying 
to find a candidate 
who will boot “The 
Orange” out of the 
White House. Here’s 
my take on some of the 
key players within the 
Democratic Party that 
have shown interest in 
the job:

Elizabeth Warren: “The Rank 

and File” — Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., has built up an esteemed 
career in the Senate over her past 
two terms. She frequently appears 
in national news as a face of the 
Democratic party in the Senate and 
has not let her esteem stop her from 
butting heads with the president 
on several occasions. Her recent 
DNA test for her Native American 
heritage has shed a negative light 
on the senator, her competence 
as well as her commitment to 
liberal causes. If Warren were to 
win the nomination, she might 
be the most liberal candidate for 
the party since 1972. While her 
future looks promising, Warren 
may fall victim to something I call 
the “Hillary Clinton effect.” This 
term refers to politicians who have 
very little connection with their 
constituencies and are not relatable, 
thus decreasing their voter base. 
While Warren may be competent 
for the job, are Democrats willing 
to nominate somebody who may 
not fit the newly shifted definition 
of “electability”? After all, the end 
game for the Democrats is to push 
the president out of his seat.

Kamala 
Harris: 
“The 

Frontrunner” — Sen. Kamala 
Harris, D-Calif., is often seen as 
the best bet for this race. As seen 
in her work as California’s attorney 
general and as a California senator, 
Harris has always been very vocal 
on matters such as immigration, 
and has recently voiced support 
for Medicare for All. Harris’s 
appointment to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee has bolstered her image 
and given her the platform to speak 
out against people like Supreme 
Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
Harris’s campaign has run off of a 
staunch call to truth and therefore 
serves as a foil to the cloud of 
obscurity associated with the 
Trump presidency. While she has 
been regarded as a second Obama, 
Harris still has much to prove to 
the people of color who felt ignored 
by the Obama administration and 
especially targeted in the Trump 

presidency. Nevertheless, young 
Democrats 
like 
myself 
often 

see Harris as a public servant 

unaffiliated with the 
stench of politics. She 
has already electrified 
her voting base.

Andrew 
Yang: 

“The Outsider” — I 
know 
what 
you’re 

thinking — the last 
time a business owner 
wanted to run for office 
we all thought it was a 
joke, only to realize our 
worst nightmare had 

come true when Donald Trump 
was elected president. Yang is a 
former tech CEO based in New 
York City who founded Venture 
for America. While he may not be 
the most conventional candidate, 
his platform has certainly set him 
apart with his proposed “Freedom 
Dividend” that would provide all 
people ages 18 to 64 with a universal 
basic income of $1000 per month. 
While many may not deem Yang as 
a viable candidate, he has received 
recognition, as Obama named him 
as the presidential ambassador for 
entrepreneurship in 2015. Yang 
continues to gain more traction, 
and maybe the breadth of his 
promises will prove beneficial. 
When Trump first announced his 
run for presidency, he was polling 
at 5 percent, and was less popular 
than Republican candidates Jeb 
Bush, Ben Carson and Marco 
Rubio. Perhaps Yang can pull off a 
Trump-esque victory by adopting 
extreme ideologies to draw voters 
to him?

John 
Delaney: 
“The 

Pragmatist” — Rep. John Delaney, 
D-Md., was one of the first people 
to announce his candidacy for 
presidency, and has already been 
gaining ground in states like Iowa. 
Though Delaney is not a household 
name like Warren or Harris, he 
has already outlined some basic 
platform ideas that center around 
a moderate, bipartisan approach to 
politics. Delaney’s entire campaign 
centers around his pragmatic 
approach to politics and his goal 
of unifying the divided nation. 
Delaney’s call to unity is shown 
through his time in Congress, as 
he has been known to work with 
both Republicans and Democrats. 
On average, Delaney votes with 
Trump 
about 
34 
percent 
of 

the time, which is higher than 
the combined percentage that 
Harris and Warren vote with the 
president. While Democrats are 
eager to prove they are not bought 
by super PACs, it is important to 
note Delaney is the sixth richest 
member of Congress and is a 

former CEO of the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Delaney’s 
realistic 

approach to politics may not be the 
best tactic for Democratic voters, 
who tend to be activists with rather 
extreme views. Both parties have 
unified their supporters through a 
common hate for their opposition. 
Can Delaney’s message unify an 
increasingly extreme party?

Julián Castro: “The Newbie” 

— Julián Castro was the former 
secretary of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
during 
Obama’s 
second 
term 

and was the youngest member of 
his cabinet. Castro’s message is 
rooted in a direct contrast to the 
xenophobic message Trump has 
preached to the American people. 
Castro entered the national stage 
as the keynote speaker at the 2012 
Democratic National Convention, 
and was even a prospective running 
mate for Hillary Clinton in 2016. At 
a youthful 44, the secretary has 
already accomplished a great deal 
by serving on the San Antonio City 
Council at age 26 and mayor of San 
Antonio at age 30. His affiliation 
with Obama and his vigor have 
proven to be an asset to the 
relatively discouraged Democratic 
voters.

I know all of this can be 

exciting. However, with so many 
competent candidates, we must 
keep in mind that the percentage 
of eligible voters among Democrats 
who vote in primary elections is 
14.4 percent. The next time you 
vote, you have to keep general 
electability in mind. We are no 
longer in the era where simply 
“being fit for the job” is enough to 
get you to the presidency — some 
may argue general competence is 
not even required to get the Oval 
Office, based on the way these past 
two years have gone. However, this 
race is more about just unseating 
Trump. It is about bringing 
back the ideals of acceptance, 
diplomacy and competency to this 
great nation. The current state 
of our union is one destitute of 
motivated leadership. Out of the 
people who have made their case 
in this past month, the only person 
I see capable of reinvigorating this 
country with hope and efficacy is 
Harris. So when primary election 
season comes around, and you are 
one of the 14.4 percent of eligible 
Democratic voters voting, ask 
yourself — who can make the most 
of the United States? When all 
things are considered, I am sure 
your answer will bring you closer 
to Harris.

F

or 
35 
days, 
the 
U.S. 

government 
remained 

shut down, marking the 

longest government shutdown 
in U.S. history. The world was 
seemingly reduced to a gridlock 
between President Trump and 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D. Calif., 
as both parties struggled to come 
to an agreement over how much 
money should be allotted towards 
border security in the federal 
budget. The event dominated the 
news — headlining broadcasts 
almost daily. And just when it 
seemed that the U.S. political 
system had reached its untimely 
demise, the president surprised 
the world by signing a continuing 
resolution 
that 
reopened the 

government 
temporarily. 
But 

while news reports were quick to 
report the “devastating effects of 
the government shutdown,” how 
much of an impact did it really 
have on the U.S. economy?

The Dow Jones Industrial 

Average has been on somewhat 
of a tear so far this year, reporting 
gains of nearly 2,000 points so 
far in the month of January. As 
many big-name corporations have 
released positive results from the 
past quarter, many investors are 
optimistic about the market. More 
than that, the Federal Reserve’s 
recent decision to go easy on 
interest rates resulted in a huge 
upside in the market, with the 

Dow jumping over 300 points in 

response to the news. 

This seems very contradictory, 

however, 
with 
many 
reports 

showing a massive reduction of 
consumer confidence as a result 
of the shutdown, with the said 
metric at its lowest level since July 
2017. Not to mention, shouldn’t 
the 800,000 workers that were 

furloughed as a result of the 
shutdown have some impact on 
the economy? Or what about the 
$3 billion of deadweight loss that 
will never be recovered? 

For 
starters, 
we 
must 

understand what causes a stock 
– or the market as a whole – to go 
up or down. Things like better or 
lower-than-expected 
earnings 

can cause a stock price to fluctuate, 
as can (as previously mentioned) a 
change in interest rates. But stocks 
also respond to political and social 
factors that have the potential to 
affect the market in the long run. 
 

It is worth mentioning that 

the stock market isn’t the same 
thing as the economy. In many 
cases, it is a very good measure of 
how the economy is doing, but its 
short-run fluctuations don’t really 
tell us as much as its trends in the 
long run do. Nevertheless, the 
market often does act as a delayed 
reaction to different economic 
trends. For example, only when 
a company reports its earnings 
for the past quarter (or forecasts 
their earnings close to the end of 
the quarter) will the price of the 
stock react to the information. It’s 
almost never an instant response. 
 
 
 
 
 

When the government finally 

reopened last weekend, a lot of 
people expected some sort of 
an increase in stock prices, as 
the economy was seen to have 
a more certain future. Instead, 
“the markets couldn’t care less” 
with the S&P 500 climbing 0.8 
percent and the Dow up 1 percent 
the afternoon Trump made the 
announcement, due more so to 
the Fed’s decisions on interest 
rates than due to the shutdown. 
The recent activity in the U.S.’s 
trade talks with China and the 
aforementioned decisions made 

by the Fed seemed to be viewed 
as far more important than the 
shutdown. And this has been true 
in the past, with the stock markets 
historically not really reacting to 
shutdowns.

Part of this has to due with 

how commonplace a shutdown 
is. In fact, since 1976 there have 
been 18 shutdowns. The other part 
is that it really doesn’t have an 
impact on the economy — at least 
for now. While there may have 
been a lot of government workers 
without 
jobs, 
traders 
were 

more concerned about earnings 
season, and how each company 
fared in the last quarter. This 
is not to say that there were not 
personal economic losses to these 
furloughed workers, with many 
unable to make due diligence on 
rent and loan payments. That 
said, while 800,000 individual 
workers do seem like quite a lot, 
their welfare does little to impact 
the economy as a whole — at 
least for the length of time the 
shutdown occurred. Perhaps the 
inefficiencies would have piled up 
had the shutdown persisted for 
longer.

Nevertheless, when the U.S. 

is operating on a $20 trillion 
economy, a $3 billion loss is very 
trivial. We’ll have to wait and see 
to what extent this is true until 
the end of the current quarter, 
when companies report whether 
they matched up to expectations. 
But for now, it seems that the 
economy is going to keep chugging 
along, with little care that the 
government was shutdown for 
more than a month.

Did the government shutdown actually do anything to slow down the economy?

HEY.

YOU'RE 
DOING GREAT 
AND WE 
know you 
can do it. 

Don't give up!

Of all the memorable moments 
to come out of DreamWorks’s 
near-perfect original “How to 
Train Your Dragon,” the one 
most likely to jump to someone’s 
mind at the mention of the film 
is the flying sequence. In all of 
twenty-first century animation, 
there have been few scenes that 
managed to match the majesty 
of those first moments when 
Hiccup (Jay Baruchel, “Man 
Seeking Woman”) first climbed 
atop 
Toothless 
and 
soared 
through the air, skimming the 
water, whooping with the sort 
of contagious joy that classic 
movie moments are made of. 
The storytelling, the score, the 
Deakins-inspired visual — it all 
came together for a moment of 
complete moviemaking synergy.
The miracle of “The Hidden 

World” is that it might actually 
surpass that magical original 
flight. As the inhabitants of the 
dragon-friendly 
utopia 
Berk 
flee from an armada of dragon 
hunters, we watch as Toothless 
begins a courtship with a female 
variant 
of 
his 
species: 
the 
“Light Fury” to 
his “Nightfury.” 
To 
call 
these 
scenes beautiful 
or 
gorgeous 
or any of the 
descriptors 
I 
usually 
attach 
to artistic styles 
would be a severe 
understatement. 
I’d rank them 
near “Fantasia” in terms of how 
perfectly they tell a story with 
nothing but visuals and John 
Powell’s (“Solo: A Star Wars 
Story”) unbelievable score.
Part of the key to their strength 

is in how they’re rendered mostly 
in close-ups allowing for a couple 
different things. Obviously it’s 
easier to appreciate how state-
of-the-art the animation is at a 
closer distance — you can actually 
see the reflection of other people 

in the characters’ eyes, which 
is a level of detail so insane that 
some 
live-action 
films 
can’t 
even match. More importantly, 
though, it allows the characters 
to speak for themselves, even 

effectively 
mute 
ones 
like 
Toothless and the Light Fury. 
Matt Reeves took advantage of a 
similar idea in “War for the Planet 
of the Apes” — if the effects are 
good enough and the character 
is expressive enough, a simple 
close-up can tell us exactly what 
they’re feeling without having to 
use a single word of dialogue. The 
result isn’t just something that’s 
aesthetically pleasing to look at; 
it’s a much more intimate feeling 
relationship than we’re used to 
seeing in an animated film. Even 
“WALL-E” made use of limited 
dialogue in its love story.
The rest of the film is fine, 
even if it occasionally struggles 
to match those epic heights. 
Hiccup’s arc sees him having 
to confront the reality that his 
time with Toothless might be 
coming to the end, and while 
that’s certainly an emotional 
way to close out the trilogy, 
it’s never given enough time 
to develop, especially because 
the third act begins and moves 
from the midpoint of the story 
to the climax to the resolution 
so quickly it’s hard to digest any 
of it. It’s strange to say, especially 
as someone usually hasty to 
criticize movies for overstaying 
their welcome, but if “The Hidden 
World” was even just five to ten 
minutes longer, it would allow for 
more development for Hiccup and 
his struggle without sacrificing 
any of the time we spend with 
Toothless and the Light Fury. 
It’s the conclusion of a critically 
acclaimed trilogy, DreamWorks! 
Treat yourself!
Yet, even this is born partially 
of a desire to spend more time in 
this world: the world of Berk, the 
world of its people, the world of 
dragons. Over three movies — and 
several TV series I admittedly 
haven’t watched — DreamWorks 
has developed a stupendous cast 
of characters brought to life in 
bold stories with animation that 
never ceases to be striking, and 
“The Hidden World” stands as 
a resolutely solid ending. It’s an 
achievement, and I think I can 
safely say that the “How to Train 
Your Dragon” trilogy will be one 
that parents and children will 
watch together for years to come. 
When they do, I hope they cherish 
their time in Berk as dearly as I 
have.

Hidden World’

Playing “God of War” makes 
me feel as if The Game Awards 
were established for the sole 
purpose of awarding it Game of 
the Year. That’s how good this 
game is. Despite 2018 being a 
very strong year for video games, 
“God of War” clearly stood out 
from the pack, primarily because 
it achieved the lofty goal that 
all art aspires to: provoking a 
conversation, 
which 
couldn’t 
have come at a more appropriate 
time.
In a world where definitions 
of masculinity are a contentious 
issue, “God of War” delivers a 
sophisticated take on topics of 
masculinity and fatherhood by 
shifting the franchise-defining 
protagonist Kratos, from the 
hyper-masculine brute of the 
previous games to a conflicted 
father determined to protect 
and train his young son, Arteus. 
Throughout 
the 
game, 
this 
thematic change is best expressed 
when Kratos teaches his son 
about the cruel world they live 
in. Despite seeming harsh on the 
surface, these moments have an 
inner tenderness revealing the 
true purpose a father fulfills in 
a son’s life. Set in the backdrop 
of Norse mythology, Kratos and 
Artreus embark on a quest to 
fulfill the dying wish of their 
recently 
deceased 
wife 
and 
mother, respectively. This epic 
journey takes the player through 
the nine realms of Yggdrasil 
where 
the 
pair 
encounter 
monsters, giants, elves and gods. 
Each character in the game, 
particularly Kratos and Atreus, 
is exquisitely written. At every 
line of dialogue, I consistently 
found myself hoping that Kratos 

would show Arteus just a sliver 
of affection, only to realize that 
I was missing the point. “God 
of War” wants the player to 
think Kratos is a bad father. The 
player’s unapproving perception 
combined with the actual threats 
Kratos faces are metaphors for 
the unrealistic pressures, both 
mentally and physically, that 
men face today. Like most men, 
Kratos does care, however, when 
being hunted by giants and gods 
it doesn’t come out in the nicest 
way.
Another 
shift 
that 
“God 
of War” benefits from is its 
reworked gameplay — replacing 
the previous 3D, isometric view 
with a third person perspective 
standard in most current action-
adventure games. The combat 
makes use of a cleaver toggle 
system that allows the player to 
fight in their own style. Enemies 
can be taken down from afar with 
Kratos’ recallable weapon, the 
“Levithan Axe,” or challenged 
up close. With each unlocked 
move, Kratos begins to feel 
almost divine. However, these 
supernatural abilities never make 
Kratos too powerful, as enemies 
also evolve in interesting and 
puzzling ways. Though minor 
enemies can be fun, the pinnacle 
of “God of War” is its boss fights. 
These 
adrenaline-inducing 
encounters against deities and 
colossal beasts are packed with so 
much ethereal movement, I truly 
felt like I was amongst the gods.
Having played every game 
nominated, “God of War” stands 
far above the rest. It wasn’t the 
grandest or flashiest game of 
2018, but it was the most artistic. 
I can’t think of a more deserving 
winner of 2018’s Game of the Year 
than the incomparable “God of 
War.”

Phoebe 
Bridgers 
and 
Conor 
Oberst 
are 
twin 
souls in the music industry. 
Oberst, an emo-indie-folk-
rock legend and former 
frontman 
of 
celebrated 
band 
Bright 
Eyes, 
has 
been writing confessional, 
straight-to-the-core 
music 
since 
his 
beginnings 
nearly 20 years 
ago. 
Bridgers’s 
first 
studio 
album, Stranger 
in the Alps, was 
released in 2017. 
But despite their 
generational 
differences, the 
duo seem to operate on the 
same creative frequency. 
In the first promotional 
pictures for their new group 
Better Oblivion Community 
Center, they seem more 
comfortable 
with 
each 
other than even a brother 
and sister may be. Though 
Bridgers has been a devoted 
fan of Oberst since she was a 
teenager, their partnership 
is equal, an intertwined 
effort to tell the narratives 
that exist between both 
of them as truthfully as 

possible.
Better 
Oblivion 
Community 
Center 
is 
Bridgers’s 
second 
group 
effort in the last year after 
2018’s boygenius, a similarly 
self-titled record by the 
silver-haired 
songwriter 
and 
other 
folk-nouveau 
standouts Julien Baker and 
Lucy Dacus as boygenius. 
Where boygenius allowed 
the three artists to merge 

into 
one 
musical 
voice, 
separate from each of them 
individually, Better Oblivion 
Community Center is an 
album that allows Bridgers 
and 
Oberst 
to 
do 
the 
opposite. The record is an 
interesting mix of the folk-
confessional 
sensibilities 
that both artists are known 
for and a frenetic, inventive 
rock edge that takes the 
listener by happy surprise 
on 
songs 
like 
“Dylan 
Thomas” and “Exception 
to the Rule.” They started 

writing together after first 
meeting a few years ago, 
and 
eventually 
realized 
that those songs needed 
a home bigger than their 
own respective projects to 
flourish. And thus, Better 
Oblivion 
Community 
Center was born.
Oberst and Bridgers have 
collaborated 
before, 
on 
Bridgers’s heart-wrenching 
ballad “Would You Rather” 
from her debut 
LP, 
and 
the 
pairing 
was 
momentary 
lightning. Both 
musicians have 
a 
spectacular 
knack 
for 
writing 
music 
that doesn’t beat 
around the bush 
in any way, shape or form. 
Instead, each lyric and turn 
of phrase digs its heels into 
the 
listener’s 
emotional 
psyche, dredging up the 
feelings and memories that 
most of us try to forget. It’s 
crying-in-the-bathroom 
music, 
walking-home-in-
the-dark music, squinting-
in-the-morning-sun music, 
goodbye-kiss music.

We’ve known for decades now 
that R. Kelly is an abuser, a child 
molester and a sexual predator. 
How has it continued for so long?
Megastar R. Kelly has long been 
revered as the king of R&B, at 
times being one of the world’s best-
selling recording artists. He has 
millions upon millions of record 
sales, platinum hits from “Bump 
n’ Grind” in 1994 to “I’m a Flirt” 
in 2007 and collaborations with 
the biggest names in the industry, 
including Jay-Z and Lady Gaga. He 
also jump-started the career of the 
late Aaliyah, among other proteges. 
Few artists are as accomplished as 
Kelly.
However, Kelly’s story is not a 
glamorous one: He was born and 
raised in the projects in Chicago, 
grew up without a father figure 
and was molested in his home. 
He earned his fame through pure 
talent and dedication to his craft.
When 
he 
skyrocketed 
to 
superstardom, Kelly was a hero to 
the Black community, especially 
in his hometown. Songs like “I 
Believe I Can Fly” and “I’m Your 
Angel” were played in churches, 
choirs, graduations and weddings.
Disturbingly, 
though, 
over 
the last three decades numerous 
women 
have 
come 
forward 
accusing 
Kelly 
of 
domestic 
violence and sexual abuse. Earlier 
this 
month, 
several 
victims, 
former associates and even family 
members of Kelly’s made their 
voices heard in the Lifetime 
docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.” 
Survivors described their lives 
with Kelly in gruesome detail. 
Several of the victims’ loved ones 
explained how Kelly lured the 
women in, often with promises of 
help in the music industry, only to 
manipulate them into dropping all 
contact with friends and family 
and dedicating themselves solely 
to Kelly.
I watched the docuseries to 
learn more about the accusations. 
As I watched, a pattern of the 
victims quickly emerged: their 
age. Most met Kelly between 15 
and 17, though he has been known 
to prey on older women if they 
seemed open to his manipulation. 
Suddenly, the nickname “Pied 
Piper of R&B” (in reference to 
the German folklore figure who 
lured children away with music) 
seems eerily fitting. Writing and 
producing an album titled Age 
Ain’t Nothing but a Number is just 
prophetic.
In a society where Black 
women’s voices are constantly 
swept under the rug, it’s no surprise 
that Kelly’s stardom continued to 
be enabled by labels, collaborators 
and fans—no matter how many 
young victims he left in his wake.

Decades of abuse

The abuse dates back to the late 
’80s and early ’90s, even before R. 
Kelly’s rise to fame. In the early 
days after launching his musical 
career, Kelly would reportedly lurk 
outside his alma mater, Kenwood 
High School, looking for young 
girls to bring back to the studio 
with him and begin a sexual 
relationship. (Today, even as recent 
as the last few years, rumors cite 

Kelly as lurking around Chicago 
in a blacked out Mercedes, slinking 
around high school parking lots 
and basketball games with his 
entourage.)
In 1994, at 27 years old, Kelly 
illegally 
married 
his 
15-year-
old 
protege 
and 
collaborator 
Aaliyah. 
Their 
marriage 
was 
annulled shortly after. In 2002, 
the infamous “pee tape” surfaced, 
allegedly showing Kelly having sex 
with (and urinating on) a 14-year-
old girl. In 2008, after several 
delays, Kelly finally went to court. 
The woman identified on the 
tape refused to testify, and a jury 
acquitted him of all charges.
In the years before and in years 
to come, many women who had 
a relationship with Kelly as a 
teenager filed lawsuits against him. 
Nearly all of them were settled out 
of court, sometimes for six-figure 
sums of money.
In 2017, veteran music journalist 
Jim DeRogatis broke the story 
of Kelly’s alleged sex cult. In the 
article, family members describe 
how their daughters have been 
manipulated into staying with 
Kelly. Former members of Kelly’s 
inner circle allege that Kelly 
controls “every aspect of (the 
victims’) lives: dictating what they 
eat, how they dress, when they 
bathe, when they sleep and how 
they engage in sexual encounters 
that he records.” A social media 
campaign, 
“#MuteRKelly,” 
followed the allegations.
For years, a horrifying case 
has been built against Kelly. The 
evidence has continued to pile 
up: 
victim 
testimonies, 
audio 
recordings, 
text 
conversations 
and lawsuits. The average person 
is numb by now: You could tell 
me anything about Kelly and 
I’d probably find it plausible. 
We’ve heard so many stories that 
headlines like “R. Kelly Is Being 
Accused Of Sexually Abusing 
And Possibly Impregnating His 
14-Year-Old Cousin” are met with a 
“yeah, probably,” by most. And yet, 
R. Kelly has denied all allegations 
of sexual misconduct.

The unspoken subject

Few artists and collaborators 
would 
speak 
up 
about 
the 
allegations against R. Kelly, despite 
overwhelming evidence of sexual 
abuse.
Amid all the clamor against 
Kelly between the sex tape and 
trial in the 2000s, the music 
industry failed to take action. 
Chocolate Factory came out in 
2003, a year into the sex tape 
scandal, and went triple platinum. 
Many young women were staunch 
defenders of Kelly, with entourages 
showing up to his trial to express 
support. Artists continued to make 
records with him, and distributors 
continued to profit off of his 
stardom.
Last year, Spotify removed 
Kelly’s 
tracks 
(among 
other 
artists who faced allegations of 
misconduct) from official playlists 
while keeping the music available 
for streaming. An industry uproar 
over censorship and targeting 
black artists caused Spotify to walk 
back on their “hateful conduct” 
policy a few weeks later.
Dream 
Hampton, 
executive 
producer of “Surviving R. Kelly,” 
struggled to get the support and 

testimony of recording artists 
who worked with Kelly. The only 
celebrity willing to speak up for 
the docuseries was John Legend. 
When 
asked 
about 
celebrity 
involvement in an interview with 
the Detroit Free Press, Hampton 
said:
“When it comes to celebrities, 
It was incredibly difficult to get 
people 
who 
had 
collaborated 
(artistically) with Kelly to come 
forward. We asked Lady Gaga. 
We asked Erykah Badu. We asked 
Celine Dion. We asked Jay-Z. We 
asked Dave Chappelle. (They’re) 
people who have been critical of 
him. That makes John Legend 
even more of a hero for me.”
Since 
the 
release 
of 
the 
docuseries, celebrities have been 
racing to disavow R. Kelly and 
express regret for supporting him. 
Two weeks later, he was dropped 
by his label, RCA. Universal Music 
Group quietly did the same last 
spring, though they still hold his 
money-printing back catalog of 
hits.
Why did everyone wait until 
now? After all, the music industry 
has known about Kelly’s true 
nature since the ’90s. But even the 
sex tape scandal was not enough to 
end his career.
At the heart of the industry’s 
guilt is money over morals. 
Only now has Kelly faded from 
relevance enough for the industry 
to flip on him. Even though we’re 
finally seeing a change in attitude 
towards Kelly, when it comes 
to accountability, the industry 
remains silent. Everyone will 
speak up to say “I don’t support 
R. Kelly.” But who would speak 
up to apologize to the victims? 
Who would speak up to say, “I 
knew about and enabled R. Kelly’s 
behavior, and I’m sorry for not 
speaking up?” If he was still making 
platinum hits today, would we even 
be having this conversation?

Should we “drop” R. Kelly?

When I first started hearing 
about the allegations against R. 
Kelly two years ago, I didn’t hesitate 
to believe them, but I pushed them 
to the back of my head. You would 
have to pry “Ignition (Remix)” 
from my cold, dead hands.
I know now that ignoring those 
thoughts was no different from 
supporting Kelly.
Watching “Surviving R. Kelly” 
made me conscious of my own 
apathy. The tearful recollections 
of Kelly’s survivors shook me to 
my core. Entire families have 
been destroyed by Kelly’s actions. 
His cult-like operation runs at 
an enormous scale, with layers 
of mental abuse that border on 
brainwashing. Kelly’s precautions 
to protect himself and his image 
are nefarious, painting him as a 
sociopath with a god complex. 
How did I continue to enjoy Kelly’s 
music for so long, without sparing a 
thought for his victims?
At one point in the docuseries, 
a clinical psychologist describes 
a phenomenon in which people 
tend to minimize the wrongdoings 
of others who have done good by 
them in the past. 

An escape of justice: Who 
is culpable for R. Kelly?

When I was eight, I asked 
my parents what a tampon was. 
My memory of this moment is 
shockingly fresh in my mind: I 
stand in the threshold between 
our family room and our kitchen, 
my socked feet on the wood floor. 
I’m almost sure that tampons 
are used to stop you from peeing 
your pants, but I want to make 
sure of it. My heart is beating 
when I ask (practically blurt) 
the question I’d been too scared 
to ask for years.
My parents look at each other 
for a moment, baffled. Then, 
they start to laugh. I’m confused. 
“You’ll find out in a few years,” 
my mom says. They turn back 
to the TV, shaking their heads. 
I stand there for a moment. 
I’m shocked at myself, but I’m 
something else too. Ashamed. 
Why did I ask that? I vowed to 
never talk about tampons again.
After sex ed in fifth grade, I 
still don’t exactly know what 
a tampon is. The girls from the 
other class file into our classroom 
as the boys file into theirs. Our 
teacher was a woman, and the 
boys’ a man. Our teacher puts 
an old VHS tape into our dusty 
classroom TV set and sits behind 
her desk, averting her eyes. The 
movie is from the 1980s and, to 
say the least, uninformative.
When 
the 
movie 
ends, 
someone raises their hand and 
asks, “What’s a period?”
Our 
teacher 
says, 
“It’s 
something every woman goes 
through.”
“Oh.”
On the playground, a boy 

asks me if we learned what 
masturbation was. I say no. He 
says it’s probably only for boys. I 
believe this until I’m 15.
The day I get my first period, 
I’m home from school. I’d been 
puking all day. I’d never felt that 
pain in my stomach, a raw pain, 
a combination of sharp and dull. 
I think it’s the flu, until I pull 
down my pants. The blood looks 
different from normal blood. 
I sit on the toilet and cry. My 
hands shake as I call my mom.
“Please buy me pads,” I say.
We don’t talk about my period 
again until I’m in college.
It’s my first year of high 
school. My friends and I talk 
about if you should shave “down 
there.” The unanimous answer 
is yes, and you should also shave 
everywhere else.
Boys will think you’re gross if 
you don’t.
You also shouldn’t smell bad.
You should use the scented 
soap from Victoria’s Secret, we 
say.
You know the joke, “What 
smells like fish? Close your legs!”
And you should only wear 
lace underwear.
Boys won’t touch you if you 
don’t.
And don’t let your panty lines 
show through your pants.
You should also use pads.
Using a tampon is basically 
losing your virginity.
Boys don’t want to have sex 
with loose girls.
Never mind pH balance and 
period 
comfort 
and 
sexual 
agency. We know all there is to 
know about our bodies because 
the boys teach us what we 
should look like and smell like 

and feel like. We’re pretty girls 
and our bodies are for them.
I didn’t know who Georgia 
O’Keeffe was until my freshman 
year of college. Her painting 
“Black Iris” appeared on a 
PowerPoint slide.
“Her 
paintings 
seem 
to 
allude to female genitalia,” my 
professor says.
“That’s totally a vagina,” my 
friend whispers to me, hand 
cupped to her ear, leaning over 
in her chair.
“Black Iris” was the first 
piece of vaginal art I’d seen by 
a woman. By men, I’d seen it 
all: portraits and paintings of 
women by men, poems, novels, 
songs about women by men. 
The female body as seen by 
men. Men had claimed women, 
had claimed the vagina. “Black 
Iris” shattered that claim. The 
masculine 
vagina 
suddenly 
became 
replaced 
by 
the 
feminine one, the right one, the 
one I owned. I liked this version 
better. In fact, I loved it.
O’Keeffe became something 
of an icon to me, the standard 
of the radical, raw embrace of 
femininity that I wanted as a 
part of myself. Hers is one of 
the only quotes I think about 
every day: “I said to myself, I 
have things in my head that are 
not like what anyone has taught 
me — shapes and ideas so near 
to me — so natural to my way of 
being and thinking that it hasn’t 
occurred to me to put them 
down. I decided to start anew, 
to strip away what I had been 
taught.”
Here is my unlearning of what 
I’ve been taught: My female 
body is mine. And it is beautiful.

“I tell myself that if I must 
live with a slippery mind, I want 
to know how to tether it too,” 
Esmé Weijun Wang writes in the 
final sentence of “The Collected 
Schizophrenias: Essays.” In her 
first non-fiction work, Wang sets 
out to articulate the capricious, 
harrowing whims of her mental 
illness by situating them in the 
personal and aggregate histories 
of schizophrenia. The result is a 
selection of stories from Wang’s life, 
each one informed by a thorough 
analysis of the laws, policies, 
norms, desires and realities 
that shape the experiences 
of those living with the 
pathology that makes up what 
Wang calls “the collected 
schizophrenias.”
These essays interrogate 
and explain various facets of 
mental illness, chronicling 
the histories of schizophrenia 
while 
simultaneously 
unrolling a map of Wang’s life. 
Wang describes schizophrenia as 
a narrative disease, an affliction 
whose 
progression 
can 
be 
mapped through the evolution 
of a protagonist. In this case, 
the 
protagonist 
is 
different 
iterations of Wang herself: as 
a child, in college, after being 
expelled from Yale, living in San 
Francisco. The text moves through 
years 
of 
transformations 
and 
diagnoses, each of which offers 
partial, contorted answers to the 
fundamental queries of the book 
and of her life. In every essay, 
the same themes arise: Is there 

some inner self that lies beyond 
the reaches of mental illness, a 
consciousness that disease makes 
invisible but leaves intact? What 
does wellness look and feel like? 
How does the production of art 
change the answers to these 
questions?
Wang is also the author of a 
novel, “The Border of Paradise,” 
which was released in 2016. She 
earned an MFA in fiction from the 
University of Michigan in 2010 and 
attended both Yale and Stanford for 
undergrad. Wang readily presents 
this information to the reader, 
carefully describing the ways she 

has wielded her biography as a 
defense — for herself and to others 
— against the real and stereotyped 
instability that is associated with 
schizophrenia.
Wang 
characterizes 
schizophrenia as the engineer of 
a precariously fluid reality, one 
whose skewed boundaries and 
deteriorating infinities eliminate 
the distinction between phantasms 
and the exterior world. Within this 
distortion, the senses no longer 
situate a person inside the certainty 
that accompanies an objective 
knowledge of the world.

For example, Wang’s mental 
illness 
sometimes 
manifests 
as a dissolving of the partition 
between what is interior and 
what is exterior. As she describes 
in “Reality, On-screen,” this can 
make watching movies and reading 
fiction harrowing. The warped 
reality of worlds similar to our own 
can trigger psychosis.
Writers are tasked with creating 
accurate or alternate realities, so 
this aspect of schizophrenia is 
particularly complex for Wang. 
Wang was cycled through a 
series of diagnoses before her 
doctors settled on schizoaffective 
disorder, bipolar type. Her 
mental illness is resistant to 
treatment, and while one of 
the final essays of the book is 
about the current state of her 
treatment (she has not had 
delusions or hallucinations in 
four years), there is a palpable 
tenuousness with which Wang 
imparts this information. As 
Wang explains, schizophrenia 
is a unpredictable illness, 
one whose trajectory and 
manifestations are often unclear.
Wang’s capacity to externalize 
self-knowledge is one of the great 
satisfactions 
of 
reading 
“The 
Collected Schizophrenias.” She is 
as good at illustrating her interior 
self as she is at interrogating 
the 
simplifications 
and 
false 
narratives inherent in memoir. 
This often appears as self-directed 
compassion, 
a 
quality 
that 
permeates the whole book.

Foul trouble exposes lack of depth as

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Jon Teske picked up his 
second foul with 11:42 left in 
the first half of Michigan’s 
game against Iowa on Friday.
The Hawkeyes were up 12-11 
after 
the 
ensuing free 
throws, and 
that’s 
when 
redshirt 
sophomore 
center 
Austin Davis 
subbed in for 
the 
junior 
center. 
The 
Wolverines 
went on a 6-0 
run immediately afterward.
If 
that 
had 
been 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
trend 
for 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team, the Wolverines would 
still have one loss, a game clear 
of anyone else in the Big Ten 
standings.
But that momentum didn’t 

continue.
Three minutes later, Iowa 
ripped off a 13-0 run to go up 
eight. Two minutes after that, 
the lead grew to 14, and at 
the end of the half, Michigan 
trailed by 13.
 Teske had played only 
one minute, and a mixture 
of Davis, freshman forward 
Brandon 
Johns, 
sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers and 
even freshman center Colin 
Castleton — who had played 
a total of 18 minutes all year 
— struggled mightily either 
to 
contain 
the 
Hawkeyes’ 
size on defense or contribute 
offensively.
“We hoped it would be 
better, but this was a bad one 
to not have (Teske),” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“Because he does so many 
different things. … We do 
not have this plethora of bigs 
coming in behind him that 

have his experience.
“… I can’t say we weren’t 
ready for it. It’s happened a 
few times, but the opponent 
hasn’t been this strong when it 
did happen.”
Of 
course, 
the 
game’s 
outcome 
can’t 
simply 
be 
boiled down to 
insufficiencies 
at one position. 
But the lack of 
a 
backup 
for 
Teske 
speaks 
to 
a 
larger 
problem for the 
Wolverines.
Michigan has 
just six players 
that score more 
than seven points per game. 
The next best is sophomore 
guard Eli Brooks, who averages 
2.9 points per game, hardly a 
trustworthy offensive option.
So when the Wolverines 

run 
into 
foul 
trouble 
or 
cold shooting nights — or if 
someone in the rotation gets 
hurt at some point throughout 
the year — it could present a 
great deal of trouble.
That 
manifested 
Friday, 
when 
Teske, 
Livers, 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis and 
sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole were all 
called for two 
fouls in the first 
half. Brazdeikis, 
Poole and junior 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson 
were 
the only players to score for 
Michigan in that first half. So 
when two of those three were 
out, the Wolverines turned to 
some unlikely sources.
Three freshmen — Castleton, 

guard David DeJulius and 
guard Adrien Nunez — got 
their first meaningful minutes 
of their careers late in the first 
20 minutes of Friday’s game.
They 
were 
not 
nearly 
enough, as made evident by the 
score at halftime. 
And as it turned 
out, 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
offense 
wasn’t 
enough 
for the rest of the 
night either.
“Basketball 
game’s a game 
full 
of 
runs,” 
Simpson 
said. 
“They’re 
gonna 
make runs, we’re 
gonna make runs. 
They just happened to make a 
big run. Salute to Iowa.”
To be clear, Michigan’s depth 
issues are not a death sentence 
by any means. Beilein-coached 
teams are notorious for fouling 
less than other teams. And 
the 
Wolverines’ 
six 
main 
contributors have proven they 
can play a ton of minutes, 
which helps mask some of the 
problems.
But the issue comes with a 
team like Iowa. The Hawkeyes 
rotated several competent big 
men 
onto 
the 
court and went 
after 
Teske, 
and it worked, 
because 
while 
the backups at 
all 
positions 
struggle to score 
for 
Michigan, 
Teske’s 
importance 
is 
twofold. Teske’s 
backups not only 
lack his offensive ability, but 
they don’t bring the defensive 
versatility he possesses.
So Iowa’s formula worked 
like a charm, and while it 
isn’t one that all teams in the 
country can employ when the 
competition gets stiffer, that 
weakness could come back to 
bite the Wolverines when it 

matters most.
Michigan’s two late-season 
games 
against 
Michigan 
State could be for the Big Ten 
Championship. The Spartans 
will undoubtedly run big men 
Nick Ward and Xavier Tillman 
at Teske when 
they meet on 
Feb. 24. If the 
Wolverines 
match up with 
the 
likes 
of 
Tennessee, 
Duke 
or 
Gonzaga 
in 
March, all of 
those 
teams 
have 
size 
to 
spare, too.
And now that 
the book is out on Michigan 
and how to stop them, there 
are two ways this thing could 
go.
The first is that Beilein 
transforms 
his 
weaknesses 
into strengths once again. 
Last 
year, 
defenses 
that 
switched ball screens gave the 
Wolverines fits, but by the end 
of the season, Michigan was 
feasting on teams that did just 
that.
Maybe this season, Davis, 
Johns or Brooks will find 
their respective 
grooves 
and 
turn 
their 
offense 
into 
the 
buzzsaw 
everyone 
witnessed 
against 
North 
Carolina 
and 
Villanova.
Or 
maybe 
the Wolverines’ 
lack of depth is 
their fatal flaw. Maybe what 
happened Friday was less a 
mirage and more a preview of 
what’s to come.
Maybe we’ll look back on 
Friday night and remember 
when Iowa found the end of a 
proverbial thread and the rest 
of Michigan’s season began to 
unravel.

SportsMonday Column: Michigan has a depth problem

IOWA CITY — Last year, 
before the start of the Big Ten 
Tournament in New York City, 
Iowa video coordinator Courtney 
Eldridge pulled the Hawkeyes’ 
sophomore class aside. In their 
two seasons at Iowa, he realized, 
the group had yet to notch a 
signature win. The next day, 
they came a point away from 
doing so in an overtime loss 
to Michigan. Instead, they fell 
just short, marking a familiarly 
disappointing end to a 14-19 
season.
Friday night against the same 
opponent, that signature win 
finally arrived, as Iowa (17-5 
overall, 6-5 Big Ten) took down 
the 
fifth-ranked 
Wolverines, 
74-59.
The game took a sour turn 
for Michigan (20-2, 9-2) just 1:19 
after tipoff, when junior center 
Jon Teske picked up his first 
foul, forcing John Beilein to call 
for Isaiah Livers off the bench. It 
only took 31 seconds before the 
sophomore forward committed 
a foul of his own. Less than a 
minute later, he too made his way 
to the bench after another foul 
under the basket.
Freshman forward Brandon 
Johns held his own until the 
under-12 media timeout, when 
Teske re-entered with the game 
knotted at 11. Six seconds later, 
Iowa forward Tyler Cook charged 
at Teske, attempting to throw a 
dunk over him. The ball rattled 
off the back of the rim, but more 
importantly, Teske was whistled 
for his second foul, sending him 
to the bench for the remainder of 
the half.
“One of our game plans, as 
always, was try to get their big in 
foul trouble,” said Iowa forward 
Luka Garza. “So we did a really 
good job of that. Me, Tyler (Cook), 
Ryan (Kriener), we all had a focus 
on that. We attacked them inside, 
just to try to get them out of there. 
And it worked for us.”
Six minutes later, Nicholas 
Baer caught the ball in transition, 
squaring up from the top of the arc 
as the crowd at Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena rose to its feet. Seconds 
later, the ball splashed through 

the net, blowing the roof off the 
building and completing a 21-2 
run that gave Iowa a 14-point lead 
it would never relinquish.
“Basketball game’s a game full 
of runs,” said junior guard Zavier 
Simpson. “They’re gonna make 
runs, we’re gonna make runs. 
They just happened to make a big 
run. Salute to Iowa.”
The run came on the back of 
a dominant inside performance 
from Iowa in Teske’s absence, 
as five of its seven field goals 
during the stretch came in the 
paint. With Johns and redshirt 
sophomore forward Austin Davis 
manning the ‘5’ for nearly the 
entire remainder of the half, the 
Hawkeyes went into halftime 
with a 22-6 advantage in the paint 
and 22-10 on the boards.
“It’s not the same presence 
of the room (without Teske),” 
Kreiner said. “Michigan gets 
really aggressive denying things. 
And if they’re denying things, 
you gotta drive the ball. … And if 
Teske’s not there to rotate over, it’s 
a lot easier to finish.”
The second half was a more 
even affair, but each Michigan 
threat was quickly snuffed out 
by an Iowa response — especially 

on the defensive end, where the 
Hawkeyes’ mix of zone, man-to-
man and full-court press forced 
the Wolverines into a 8-for-33 
performance from three.
Michigan, though, was able 
use a 16-6 run to cut the deficit to 
five midway through the second 
half, relying on Teske’s interior 
presence to get back into the game.
Then, with 9:08 to play and 
a chance to silence the Carver-
Hawkeye 
crowd, 
sophomore 
Jordan Poole pump faked, slid to 
his left and fired off a three that 
would have pulled the Wolverines 
within four. It clanged off the 
front of the rim and into the hands 
of Iowa forward Luka Garza. 
Seconds later, Garza popped a 
3-pointer from the right wing. 
Unlike Poole’s, his caught nothing 
but net.
From there, the final eight 
minutes 
were 
an 
obligatory 
procession toward the final buzzer 
sounding and a mass of black-and-
gold clad students descending on 
the court. As students mobbed the 
team, the arena speakers began to 
blast Queen’s Another One Bites 
The Dust.
Only for the Hawkeyes, this 
win was one of a kind.

Michigan falls to Iowa, 74-59, as lack of big-man depth exposed

IOWA CITY — First came 
Isaiah Livers. It was 81 seconds 
into Friday’s game, and junior 
center Jon Teske had picked up a 
foul. John Beilein, in turn, went to 
the sophomore, his most reliable 
backup center option to date.
Less than two minutes later, 
after Livers picked up a foul of 
his own, it was Brandon Johns’ 
turn. Five minutes after that, with 
Michigan looking sluggish, Beilein 
went back to Teske.
In just six seconds, he got 
whistled for his second foul, and 
that’s when things went from bad 
to worse.
“You don’t have a 7-(foot)-1, 260-
(pound) guy standing in the paint,” 
Iowa’s Joe Wieskamp would say 
two hours later. “Obviously they 
have (Austin) Davis that comes in 
off the bench, but he’s not Teske.”
Davis was in just five minutes, 
a span over which the Hawkeyes 
attacked him, then attacked him 
some more — finding repeated 
success. But he wasn’t the only 
person that faltered while Teske 
sat.
So did Livers, and Johns, and 

Colin Castleton.
Get Jon Teske in foul trouble, 
it turns out, is how you get the 
Wolverines to file off the court, 
heads hung low, backs turned to 
a sea of students flowing from 
their seats to the court. Iowa 74, 
Michigan 59 was the reason for 
their jubilation and Teske — or the 
lack thereof — was the reason for 
the score.
Without him, the Hawkeyes 
feasted, turning a defense that came 
into Iowa City ranked first in the 
nation into one befitting of a Beilein 
team of old. They scored 22 times 
in the paint in the first 20 minutes, 
grabbing 26 rebounds to Michigan’s 
12. For 19 of those minutes, Teske 
sat on the bench, watching the 
margin climb, and with 2:26 to go in 
the half, Beilein proverbially threw 
up his hands and sent Castleton 
onto the floor.
The freshman checked in with 
the Wolverines down 13 — getting 
outplayed front to back — and the 
Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena 
crowd 
hungering for more. It was his first 
meaningful action of the season, 
in a far-from-ideal scenario for 
a freshman still adapting to the 
college game.
The reason why it happened, 

seemingly, had more to do with 
everybody else.
“We needed something,” Beilein 
said. “The guys that come off the 
bench have to understand there’s a 
certain speed you need to play with, 
effort you need to play with. When 
they don’t do that, we’ve got to go 
further down the bench.”
It’s easy to forget Jon Teske when 
he’s merely a cog in the system. The 
Hawkeyes came into Friday with a 
goal of getting him into foul trouble, 
and forcing him to sit. They did 
just that — and with him gone, the 
entire machine fell apart.
In that first half, Michigan 
coughed 
up 
1.24 
points 
per 
possession, fouling more often than 
it hit a field goal. Two weeks ago, 
Wisconsin stymied the Wolverines’ 
offense by junking it up. On Friday, 
Iowa scored at will by forcing its 
biggest piece to sit and watch.
Teske played 11 minutes and 55 
seconds in the second half before 
fouling out, and was a plus-3 over 
13 minutes of action in a game 
Michigan lost by 15. The value of 
a player is easiest to quantify once 
he’s gone.
“The 
way 
Michigan 
plays 
defense is they’re really aggressive 
on ball-screens, and they drag them 
a lot,” said Iowa’s Ryan Kriener. “So 
that means he has to be the man 
in recovery. If you can either drive 
him or all bigger guys have trouble 
with — if you jump, jump into him, 
in that direction, bringing your 
arms down.
“... I can’t commend Jon Teske 
enough, because I know how 
overlooked he is. But knowing the 
game, that dude’s the key to their 
defense. They’re one of the best 
defensive teams in the country. I 
100 percent believe that he’s the key 
to that.”
This isn’t about Jon Teske, but 
the lack of a viable option behind 
him. On Thursday, Beilein was 
asked about the backup center spot 
and kept saying the same thing 
he has for over a month. Whether 
Davis or Johns is the first big off 
the bench depends on matchup, and 
how practice has been going.
On Friday, asked if the loss shed 
any light on the situation, he was a 
bit more direct.
“We can’t find a backup ‘5,’ ” 
Beilein said. “That would be the 
conclusion.”

It’s happened a 
few times ... the 
opponent hasn’t 
been as strong.

Wolverines take down Badgers, 76-70

After its game against Iowa was 
moved a day back due to weather, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team had less than 48 hours to 
prepare for Wisconsin.
That proved to be enough 
time, as the Wolverines (14-9 
overall, 5-6 Big Ten) defeated the 
Badgers (11-12, 2-9), 76-70, Sunday 
afternoon in Madison despite a 
slow start.
Just over a minute into the 
game, while handling the ball in 
the left corner, sophomore guard 
Deja Church lost her footing 
and hit the ground. It didn’t end 
up as anything serious, but she 
still sat out for the next five and 
a half minutes. The Wolverines 
adjusted by putting junior forward 
Akienreh Johnson on the court.
Michigan fed the ball to 
senior center Hallie Thome quite 

frequently early on. This paid off, 
as she led the team in the first half 
with eight points. Besides Thome’s 
success, though, the Wolverines’ 
offense looked unconvincing in 
the opening frame. Regardless, 
they led, 17-14, heading into the 
second quarter and never gave up 
the lead.
The start of the second quarter 
was more upbeat for Michigan, 
as the team went on a 6-0 run. 
First, freshman guard Amy Dilk 
found Thome down low, who 
converted a reverse layup. Next, 
Dilk missed a layup, but freshman 
forward Naz Hillmon was nearby 
for the putback. And then Church 
showed off her finishing touch 
while attacking the basket with 
authority, to give her team a 23-14 
lead.
Then came the drought.
Over two and a half minutes 
went by with neither team scoring. 
Things picked up again for both 

sides after the media timeout 
with less than five minutes to go 
in the half, and the Wolverines 
maintained the upper-hand at the 
break, with a 32-22 advantage.
Hillmon 
led 
Michigan 
in 
scoring with 20 points. She made a 
big impact during the third quarter 
with 
back-to-back 
three-point 
plays to give her team momentum. 
Her success was sparked by Dilk, 
who finished with eight assists.
“(Dilk) 
was 
incredible 
— 
hard to take off the court,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
to WTKA. “Just really saw Naz, 
was able to get her the ball. Just 
a tremendous job. She’s a really 
special player for us.”
Michigan’s lead from the first 
half was enough to keep it out of 
real trouble, but there were some 
scares.
The 
Wolverines’ 
margin 
reached 16 points in the fourth 
quarter. But Wisconsin countered 

with a 8-0 run to cut the deficit to 
single digits. Thome — who was 
playing with four fouls — notched 
a layup to end the run, but the 
Badgers kept fighting and made it 
a six-point game.
Thome soon converted another 
basket, and then senior guard 
Nicole Munger drained a 3-pointer 
from the top to give her team a 
nine-point lead that pretty much 
settled things. Wisconsin tallied a 
few desperation buckets in the last 
minute to shrink the deficit, but it 
wouldn’t matter.
“For her to be able to come in 
the game and do that was just 
really incredible,” Barnes Arico 
said of Thome. “ … When the game 
is on the line, it’s nice to be able to 
go to your seniors and really count 
on them.”
This 
win 
well-served 
Michigan’s confidence, as it’s the 
team’s first conference win on the 
road and second win in a row.

‘M’ suffers first defeat

An undefeated record under 
a new head coach. Kanen Storr’s 
arrival after two years at Iowa 
State. Freshman Mason Parris’ 
rise after starting the fall 
redshirted. Michigan wrestling 
has had quite a season.
After last week’s dramatic 
19-17 upset win over No. 2 
Ohio State, the Wolverines, 
moving up to a No. 4 ranking, 
seemed unstoppable — a force 
to challenge the best in college 
wrestling. But the Wolverines 
had yet to face No. 1 Penn State.
The No. 4 Michigan wrestling 
team (9-1, 5-1 Big Ten) lost to 
No. 1 Penn State (10-0, 6-0 Big 
Ten), 25-11, Friday, dropping 
its first meet of the season. The 
Wolverines lead the team score 
after five matches but dropped 
the subsequent five.
To start the match on a high 
note at 125 pounds, sophomore 
Drew Mattin outmaneuvered 
his opponent, building up riding 
time and winning the match, 
6-0, for Michigan. Redshirt 
junior Stevan Micic, ranked first 
in the country at 133 pounds, 
also added to the success, 
trouncing the Nittany Lions’ 
Scott Stossel, 20-5, in a technical 
fall. The bonus points from 
Micic’s win, as well as fifth-year 
senior Malik Amine’s 7-5 win 
in the 149-pound division, gave 
the Wolverines an 11-3 lead to 
start the match, an impressive 
margin considering Penn State’s 
prowess in rankings.
Despite the early lead, though, 
redshirt juniors Logan Massa 
and Myles Amine both dropped 
close matches to No. 1 wrestlers 
in the 165 and 174-pound weight 
classes, 
respectively. 
While 
the losses set Michigan back in 
the team score, the momentum 
from Massa’s overtime matchup 
against the Nittany Lions’ No. 
1 
ranked 
Vincenzo 
Joseph, 
gave the Wolverines strong 
momentum.

“It was really a razor-thin 
margin in that dual meet despite 
the score,” said Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet. “We recognize 
that Penn State has an excellent 
team and we knew that we were 
going to be wrestling in front 
of a sell-out crowd at the Bryce 
Jordan Center, and our guys 
were excited to push forward.”
Trailing 11-12 after seven 
matches, Michigan did just that. 
Stepping to the mat after seven 
weeks off with an undisclosed 
industry, 
redshirt 
freshman 
Jelani Embree battled with the 
Nittany Lions’ Shakur Rasheed, 
ranked seventh, in the 184-
pound 
division. 
Though 
he 
ended up losing the match 5-3, 
Bormet pointed to Jelani’s tough 
performance against a strong 
competitor as a testament to the 
team’s grit in their first loss of 
the season.
“I don’t think it will affect 
their morale,” Bormet said. 
“They expected to win those 
matches, 
and 
there 
were 
opportunities we had to win 
those matches.”
In some matches, Michigan 
left those opportunities unused. 
Penn State secured a victory 
when top-ranked Bo Nickal 
pinned redshirt junior Jackson 
Striggow at 197 pounds. Already 
dominant with fast offense and 
multiple near pins, Nickal forced 
Striggow’s shoulders to the mat, 
earning six team points and a 
fall. Penn State continued the 
dominance to the end, finishing 
the meet with a 19-8 major 
decision win over freshman 
heavyweight Mason Parris, a 
breakout star since his debut 
Jan. 3.
Despite landslide losses to end 
the meet, the Wolverines see the 
loss as a strong effort to build on 
going into the postseason.
“We’ve gotta continue to dig a 
little deeper and press forward,” 
Bormet said. “We’ve got six 
weeks to improve and get where 
we want to be in March.”

With the outcome of the 
meet in her hands, senior Olivia 
Karas stood in the corner of 
the floor with one hand on her 
hip and the other covering her 
face.
Her 
Madonna-inspired 
routine brought the crowd at 
Crisler Center to its feet. Her 
teammates rushed the floor 
to hug her, and parents in the 
stands screamed and clapped. 
The score flashed — a 9.950 
— and the No. 10 Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics 
team 
(6-2 overall, 2-0 Big Ten) had 
defeated No. 13 Nebraska (3-1, 
2-0) 196.500-195.700.
Despite winning the meet, 
the Wolverines had their share 
of struggles.
Stuck 
landings 
eluded 
Michigan on the vault. Just 
two gymnasts, freshman Abby 
Brenner and Karas, earned 
scores at or above a 9.800. The 
Wolverines scored a 48.775 on 
the first rotation, and trailed 
the Cornhuskers by .175. 
“We did really nice, big, 
pretty vaults with two-tenth 
hops on the landings,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 

“We have got to fix (the 
landings).”
In 
her 
anchoring 
spot 
on vault, freshman Natalie 
Wojcik launched herself into 
the air and, for the first time 
this season, landed with her 
bottom-side on the mat. Her 
score was a 9.325.
Stepping up to the uneven 
bars after her first fall, Wojcik 
was composed and confident. 
When it came time for her 
dismount, she released the 
bar, flipped twice in the air 
and stuck the landing. The 
judges awarded her a 9.925, the 
highest score of the night on 
bars.
“She learned a lot from 
tonight,” Plocki said. “She 
learned you can put the past 
in the past. That’s what college 
gymnastics is.”
Falls 
followed 
the 
Wolverines 
to 
their 
other 
rotations, 
where 
junior 
Lexi Funk fell off the beam 
and stumbled on one of her 
tumbling 
passes 
during 
floor. These mistakes forced 
the other gymnasts in the 
lineup to score big on their 
routines. In addition to Karas’ 
performance, Wojcik, Brenner 
and senior Emma McLean 

combined to earn the four 
highest scores on floor of the 
meet.
Sophomore 
Anne 
Maxim 
debuted in the lineup for the 
Wolverines and swung her 
way to a 9.825 on bars. She also 
performed an exhibition vault, 
flipping over the table and 
sticking her landing to receive 
a 9.825. 
“I’m super excited and proud 
of her,” Plocki said. “She’s 
what I call a meet baby. She 
steps it up, she’s that person 
who gets better with the meet 
adrenaline. 
I 
wouldn’t 
be 
surprised at all if she sees more 
spots in more lineups.”
Michigan’s 
performance 
may not have been what it was 
hoping for, but the mistakes 
made will allow the team 
to grow and improve as the 
season progresses.
 “We got better and better 
throughout the meet,” Plocki 
said. “I’m really thrilled with 
how they all did. We still have 
so much room for improvement, 
but this whole year we’ve been 
choosing to look at the good 
side of things, and we’re gonna 
choose to look at the things 
that we learned that will help 
us down the road.”

Natalie Wojcik took the first 
fall of the night as the freshman 
tried to land her vault routine 
and took the breath out of 
Crisler Center right with her.
It’s not easy being the first 
competitor to miss the mark in 
a 
competitive 
Big 
Ten 
meet 
against 
13th-ranked 
Nebraska (3-2, 
2-1 
Big 
Ten). 
There was a lot 
at stake.
“(Wojcik) 
was 
obsessing 
about what she 
did 
wrong,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki.
The team had to secure a 
win against Nebraska after 
losing last year. Given the 
circumstances, 
Wojcik’s 
reaction was understandable.
Wojcik’s breakout season has 
drawn a lot of praise, prompting 
even greater expectations.
“That’s the thing that you 
risk when you come out as 
a freshman and you’re the 

superstar like that right out 
the gate,” Plocki said. “People 
think that you’re not human. 
(The mistake) does not matter, 
what matters is the next three 
events.”
After falling behind at the 
end of the first rotation, 48.777- 
48.950, the Wolverines and 
Wojcik took to the uneven bars 
at the advice of 
Plocki.
The 
mistake 
does not matter, 
what matters is 
the next three 
events.
Wojcik soared 
and 
stuck 
her 
landing 
this 
time, earning the 
highest score of 
9.925. Then she 
did it again on the beam, leading 
the others with 9.875 points. She 
almost did it a third time during 
her fiery floor routine, bested by 
only .05 points by senior Olivia 
Karas.
Entering 
the 
last 
event, 
Michigan 
was 
now 
ahead, 
147.200-146.975, thanks in large 
part to Wojcik’s rebound.
A fall for junior Lexi Funk 
on the floor routine put the 

Cornhuskers back in the lead 
and after staying neck and neck, 
a fall from Nebraska’s Sierra 
Hassel meant that a stellar 
floor performance from Karas 
could nab the victory for the 
Wolverines.
This time last year, Karas 
could not have been in a more 
different position. Suffering a 
season-ending Achilles injury 
against Maryland forced her 
to spend the rest of her junior 
season 
watching 
from 
the 
sidelines in a wheelchair as her 
team ceded to Nebraska.
Her resulting 9.950 score 
— meaning that one judge 
awarded her a perfect 10 — was 
a personal victory as much as 
a team accomplishment, as the 
Wolverines stayed undefeated 
in Big Ten play, 196.500-195.700.
“I haven’t done a full floor 
routine on this floor yet, the 
one I got hurt on,” Karas said. 
“(Winning the meet) was a very 
emotional moment.”
Whether it be a fall in the 
first event or a season-ending 
injury, 
Michigan 
showed 
the perseverance to embrace 
adversity 
and 
overcome 
obstacles to pull off a memorable 
win.

MINNEAPOLIS 
— 
Across 
the first 10 games of the season, 
Michigan’s power play scored 15 
goals. In the ensuing 17 games, 
the Wolverines tallied just five 
goals on the man advantage.
This 
weekend 
against 
Minnesota, the Michigan hockey 
team had 12 opportunities on the 
power play, including three with 
a two-man advantage. But in the 
27 minutes the Wolverines spent 
with an extra man — or two — 
across the two games, they failed 
to convert a single time.
While Michigan was struggling 
to find success on the power play, 
the Golden Gophers converted 
on four of their 11 chances with 
an extra man. The Wolverines’ 
penalty kill held strong in some 
moments, particularly in Friday 
night’s win, but the following day, 
it was the penalty-killing unit 
that allowed Minnesota’s game-
winning goal.
“It 
was 
a 
special 
teams 
weekend,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “We were 0-for-
whatever and they were 3-for-
whatever and that’s the story. 
That’s the headline, that’s the 
story of the game. That’s it.”
Michigan 
knew 
coming 
into the series that the Golden 
Gophers’ power play was highly 
efficient — it entered the weekend 
converting at a 30-percent clip in 
Big Ten play.

And despite Pearson’s repeated 
messages about the importance 
of staying out of the penalty box, 
the Wolverines were whistled for 
13 penalties over the course of 
the weekend. Freshman forward 
Dakota Raabe was called for four 
in the second period alone on 
Saturday night — one of which 
resulted in him being ejected 
from the game and a five-minute 
power play for Minnesota.
As soon as the five-minute 
major penalty was announced, 
the crowd seemed to be waiting 
for the Golden Gophers to score a 
goal. It felt all-but-inevitable. 
But 
Michigan’s 
penalty 
kill remained composed and 
methodically 
eliminated 
the 
extended man advantage. In the 
third period, though, it broke 
down and allowed the Golden 
Gophers to score the game-
winner.
“We talked about it that we 
couldn’t take penalties and it 
ended up killing us at the end,” 
Pearson said. “Just took too 
many penalties and the last one 
caught us. It’s no secret. Eight 
power play goals for them now in 
three games, you have to learn. … 
They’re not learning. Gotta put 
guys in the lineup who are gonna 
learn and do their job.”
The Wolverines got another 
chance after allowing that goal 
to Minnesota’s power play, but 
as it did throughout the series, 
Michigan’s power play couldn’t 
convert when it had a chance.

With just over a minute left, 
Gopher defenseman Tyler Nanne 
was sent to the penalty box for 
slashing. The Wolverines trailed 
by one goal, and the power play 
— their seventh of the game — 
offered an opportunity to send 
the game to overtime. 
Pearson 
pulled 
freshman 
goaltender Strauss Mann for an 
extra attacker seconds before 
the penalty was called and opted 
to leave him on the bench so 
his team could have a two-man 
advantage.
It almost worked.
Junior forward Nick Pastujov 
got a look at a wide-open net as 
goaltender Mat Robson slid out 
of position, leaving the right side 
of the net free. But Pastujov’s shot 
went just wide and Minnesota 
was able to clear the puck down 
the ice, ending Michigan’s final 
scoring chance of the game.
“We had our chances,” Pearson 
said. “Pastujov at the end there, 
pass comes right through the 
crease, backdoor, and we whiff 
on it. We were just a little off. 
We were just a little off tonight, 
and you can’t be just a little off or 
else you’re not gonna win in this 
league.”
Pastujov’s wide shot was just 
one in a line of near-misses for the 
Wolverines on the man advantage 
over the weekend. Michigan 
created opportunities with the 
man advantage — it just struggled 
to finish them.
“I think we had some chances,” 
said 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn Hughes on Saturday. “I 
know I could’ve scored at least 
three in that second period, so I 
think sometimes it just doesn’t 
click for you. Obviously, that’s 
what’s going on right now.”
But the Wolverines’ power play 
has had difficulty since December 
— it didn’t just find trouble in 
this one series. The issues for 
Michigan on the power play run 
deeper than just having things 
not click.
And with just seven regular-
season games left, with the 
Wolverines in a tenuous position 
for the postseason, time is of the 
essence for the power play to turn 
things around.

MINNEAPOLIS — Mel Pearson 
preached disciplined throughout 
the week. After Friday’s game 
against Minnesota, the Michigan 
coach preached it even more.
“We have to stay out the penalty 
box,” Pearson said after Friday’s 
4-2 win over the Golden Gophers. 
“Most of our penalties were not 
saving goals. They were all down in 
the far end, in our offensive zone, 
so we have to clean that up.”
Despite the emphasis on clean 
play, the Michigan hockey team 
failed to execute, and it cost them 
in a 4-3 loss to Minnesota on 
Saturday.
Momentum had been building 
for both sides. The opening 10 
minutes of the game were defined 
by dangerous opportunities that 
ended inches short from breaking 
the scoring ice for either team.
That was, until Tyler Nanne 
found the back of the net for the 
Golden Gophers following a one-
timer at the top of the zone. The 
shot went stick-side, and junior 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne 
couldn’t slide over to stop the shot 
from flying past his padding.
And 
just 
like 
that, 
the 
momentum 
that 
had 
been 
mounting for both ends shifted in 
favor of Minnesota. Breakaways 
and odd-man rushes that had 
plagued Michigan before seemed 
all the more threatening.
The Wolverines failed to sway 
the momentum shift even with 
their man-advantage on the power 
play. Senior defenseman Nicholas 
Boka received the puck in the 
offensive zone, but turned it over 
trying to get a pass off.
Chasing down the breakaway, 
he committed a penalty in turn to 
stop Minnesota’s odd-man rush 
from turning into a goal. The 
highly-potent 
Golden 
Gopher 
power play, however, made Boka 
pay, as Rem Pitlick converted the 
man-advantage to widen the lead 
to two.
Michigan 
received 
an 
opportunity to strike back nearing 
the period’s end as Minnesota’s 
Nathan 
Burke 
committed 
a 
penalty, and the Golden Gophers 

sent too many players on the ice. 
The 
five-on-three 
advantage 
was the Wolverines’ second of 
the series, but just like the first 
opportunity Friday, the five-on-
three ended without a goal.
In contrast, as the final power 
play from the first period — which 
bled into the start of the second 
period — ended, Minnesota took 
the puck, and Tyler Sheehy scored 
a goal off a full-rink push.
“We didn’t start on time. We 
didn’t show up,” Pearson said. “You 
could just tell that they were gonna 
— by the comments of their coach 
that they were gonna compete 
harder. We knew that.”
Pearson, behind the bench, 
pointed to freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann and then to the 
goalpost, signifying a change in 
goaltenders.
Following 
the 
switch 
in 
netminders, it seemed as if the 
Wolverines found their spark. 
Scoring three consecutive goals, 
they answered the slow start with 
a mid-game bang.
Junior forward Jake Slaker 
received the puck from Quinn 
Hughes. 
The 
sophomore 
defenseman curled toward the 
right faceoff circle and immediately 
yelled for the puck. Slaker found 
Hughes and as the latter collected 
the puck at his stick, he fired a shot 
that rang in with 3:28 to go in the 
second.
“We 
were 
getting 
pretty 
frustrated,” Slaker said. “We were 
getting some pretty good chances, 
but we knew weren’t playing our 
game. Quinn made a nice play to 
me, dropped it, and luckily I hit 
him back and he finished it and 
I think that kind of sparked the 
bench, showing that was still so 
much time in the game and that we 
still had a game to get back into it.”
Moments later, Slaker, again, 
collected the puck and pushed 
down the ice and into the offensive 
zone. He passed the puck off to 
sophomore Michael Pastujov. The 
forward garnered the puck and put 
it in the net.
And then, less than two minutes 
later, Pastujov found the net again, 
this time off of a rebound from 
Slaker’s shot, tying the game at 3. 
The period had saw two major 

penalties from both teams, though 
neither could convert. In spite 
of the fact that Michigan had a 
near-two 
minute 
five-on-three 
advantage, none of the chances 
generated were enough to stop the 
power-play goal drought.
“I think we’re getting good 
opportunities,” Slaker said. “I 
think it’s one of those things where 
you can say what you want but 
pucks just aren’t going in for us 
right now. We’re getting the shots, 
we’re getting the looks, it’s maybe a 
few things we can tighten up.
The third period saw Minnesota 
capitalize on the man-advantage. 
Six minutes into the period, 
sophomore Jack Becker tripped 
Golden Gopher skater, leading to a 
penalty. Tommy Novak converted 
a shot that rocketed past Mann, 
giving Minnesota a 4-3 lead.
“Just took too many penalties 
and the last one caught us,” 
Pearson said. “It’s no secret. Eight 
power play goals for them now in 
three games, you have to learn. You 
gotta learn. They’re not learning.”
With less than two minutes to 
go, Nanne was called for a slashing 
penalty. 
The 
Wolverines 
had 
already pulled their goaltender 
for an empty-net situation, but 
the penalty allowed them one last 
push with a six-on-four advantage. 
Similar to the early two-man 
advantage, Michigan failed to 
convert the opportunities given, 
and when the horn sounded, it 
reaped the woes of the Golden 
Gophers converting theirs.

Loss to Iowa puts Michigan’s offensive struggles on full display

Colin Castleton rose up and 
released a 3-pointer. The ball 
arced through the air before 
coming to an unsightly halt, 
lodging itself in the crook 
between the backboard and 
rim.
You’d be hard-pressed to 
script a more apt ending for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s 74-59 loss to Iowa on 
Friday night. The Wolverines 
went 9-for-28 for the field in 
the first half and were barely 
better in the second, shooting 
32.3 percent and scoring 0.81 
points per possession against 
the 
Big 
Ten’s 
worst 
defense 
in 
adjusted 
efficiency.
For Michigan, 
the game was 
thrown 
into 
chaos 
at 
the 
start. With both 
junior 
center 
Jon Teske and 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers in foul trouble, the 
Wolverines sputtered, and the 
Hawkeyes ran off a 21-2 first-
half run.
Michigan never recovered 
from the resulting 13-point 
halftime 
deficit. 
But 
its 
second loss can only partly be 
explained by foul trouble. For 
40 minutes, the Wolverines 
couldn’t hit a shot.
“Especially in the second 
half and even in the first 
half, we were just missing,” 
said freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis. “I felt like there 
were some not-so-good shots 
that we took that were tough to 
make, but then there was also a 
lot of great shots that we didn’t 
make.”
Iowa’s defense is by no means 
its biggest strength — it’s 96th 
nationally in adjusted defensive 
efficiency, per KenPom. But 

not all bad defenses are created 
equal. The Hawkeyes are one of 
just two teams in the Big Ten 
that play a significant amount 
of zone defense, a tactic which 
requires a different set of rules 
to crack.
To beat a zone defense, a 
team must move in order to get 
quality shots. Then it needs to 
knock them down. Michigan 
was unable to do either.
“We had to take a lot of threes 
at the end,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “We didn’t 
get many good looks. They 
were really honest, and then 
sometimes we didn’t position 
ourselves or have the patience 
to get good looks.”
The 
Wolverines 
missed 
many 
of 
the 
good 
looks they did 
get. With nine 
minutes left and 
a chance to cut 
Iowa’s lead to 
four, sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole 
pump-
faked 
into 
an 
open three from straight on. It 
bounced off the front rim.
But 
too 
often 
Michigan 

stagnated, 
content 
to 
fire 
long 3-pointers over the zone 
instead of taking the time to 
pick it apart. Late in the game, 
down 
67-56, 
junior 
guard 
Zavier Simpson — a 27 percent 
3-point shooter — missed a 
24-footer with 22 seconds left 
on the shot clock.
Hawkeye 
forward 
Tyler 
Cook grabbed the rebound, 
but Brazdeikis poked it loose. 
Instead of setting up a play, 
Brazdeikis passed to Livers, 
who took a contested wing 
three with his feet not yet set. 
Clank.
The 
Wolverines 
took 
33 
threes Friday. They made eight.
“We 
have 
this 
habit 
of 
playing at the NBA 3-point 
line, playing really deep, and 

shooting NBA threes when we 
could possibly shoot college 
threes,” Beilein said. “If you 
guys have any secret on how to 
break it, I’d like your help. We 
can’t get guys to move against 
the zone.”
This was always a losable 
game for Michigan. On top of 
all the usual aphorisms about 
winning on the road in the Big 
Ten, Iowa’s offense ranks 10th 
in the country. And while the 
Hawkeyes’ defense is usually 
poor, the length and size of 
their zone can frustrate a team 
unfamiliar with it.
“It 
bothers 
everybody,” 
Beilein said. “You don’t see it 

a lot, and then they go down 
and they’re really good in their 
zone. Their length in their zone 
is really good, and they just do 
some things in their zone and 
they made it tough for us.”
Still, 
the 
Wolverines 
went on the road and held a 
high-powered offense to an 
acceptable 
1.02 
points 
per 
possession. Zone or not, foul 
trouble or not, Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena or not, they had their 
chances to win.
If not for one area of minor 
importance: 
They 
couldn’t 
score.
Over its last five games, 
Michigan is scoring just 61.2 

points per game on 37-percent 
shooting and has fallen to 
ninth in the Big Ten in scoring. 
It’s hard to pinpoint the main 
culprit, either — most of the 
Wolverines’ usual contributors 
are putting up stat lines vaguely 
similar — but lower than — 
their season totals. The drop 
in efficiency has been a team-
wide phenomenon.
“We 
just 
have 
ups 
and 
downs throughout the season,” 
Simpson said. “We just have to 
fix them.”
The lack of one discernable 
issue makes those downs that 
much harder to fix. Before 
the season, Michigan’s hopes 

rested on an elite defense and 
getting just enough from an 
offense with few established 
playmakers or shooters. But 
all of that was said before the 
Wolverines started out 20-2 
and rocketed past all of those 
expectations.
Michigan’s offense has fallen 
to 42nd in adjusted efficiency. 
Fourteen of the past 17 national 
champions 
ranked 
15th 
or 
higher, and the worst title-
winning offense during that 
span was 39th.
If the Wolverines are to 
reach the upside their defense 
provides, they will, at some 
point, need to score the ball.
