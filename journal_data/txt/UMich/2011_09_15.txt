President Mary Sue
Coleman involved
in AAU vote
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
The newest member of the
Big Ten, the University of'
Nebraska-Lincoln, was voted
out of the Association of Ameri-
can Universities - becoming
the only member of the Big Ten
to not be part of the association.
The AAU - an association
comprised of the nation's top
research universities - has
never before voted to remove a
member, though other universi-
ties have left voluntarily on the
expectation they would soon be
voted out due to failure to meet
the organization's criteria. The
vote comes nine months after
the university's induction into
the Big Ten.
Among the committee mem-
bers who voted on Nebraska's
membership in the AAU was
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, who was also involved
in the final vote in determining

the school's place in the pro-
gram.
According to a Sept. 3 arti-
cle in the Journal Star, Har-
vey Perlman, chancellor of the
University of Nebraska, said he
thought Coleman and Carolyn
Martin, the former chancellor
of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, voted against Nebras-
ka's membership in the AAU.
Though the vote is anonymous,
he said in the article he assumed
this given the fact that Coleman
and Martin are members of
committees that recommended
the reassessment of Nebraska's
AAU membership.
The decision to remdove
Nebraska from the organization
in April transpired after the
school was called to be reviewed
by AAU committees that were
concerned the school no longer
held the qualifications for mem-
bership in the program, accord-
ing to Barry Toiv, the AAU's vice
president for public affairs.
"There is a set of criteria that
are used to determine whether
universities ought to be consid-
ered for membership or current
members should be discontin-

Students required
to trade in old
1 IDs by Nov.1
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
The Mcard system on campus
is about to get a lot smarter.
In the final phase of a two-
year effort to make buildings
across campus more secure, all

returning University students
must trade their existing Mcards
for new "smart" Mcards by Nov.
1. As the new Mcard system is
put into place, the University is
aiming to make more LSA build-
ings only accessible after hours
through the programmable
chips found in the smart Mcards.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
the safety effort first began on
North Campus this past summer,
when the University replaced

manual locks on academic build-
ings with either card-swipers
or proximity card readers. By
installing the card-readingtech-
nology, Brown said, buildings
can be locked earlier and will
only be accessible to students,
faculty and staff members with
smart Mcards. The system also
allows particular colleges with-
in the University to limit their
building access to only students
in the college or school rather
than the entire student body.

Brown said the hope is that by
Jan.1 the system will be expand-
ed to a number of LSA build-
ings and other commonly-used
buildings on Central Campus
that have traditionally remained
unlocked until late in the eve-
ning. The goal of using the new
Mcards is to reduce and ulti-
mately eliminate unauthorized
access to campus buildings -
particularly at night when they
are less occupied, she said.

MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
MSA resolution calls for
plastic water bottle ban


Environmental
Issues Commission
hopes to discuss
topic with regents
By ALYSSA ADLER
Daily StaffReporter
A group of University stu-
dents is continuing its crusade
to make the University more

environmentally friendly by
eliminating the sale of bottled
water on campus.
As aresult of the efforts of the
Michigan Student Assembly's
Environmental Issues Com-
mission, the assembly recently
passed a resolution calling for
the University to cease selling
plastic water bottles. During
the winter semester, the com-
mission started a petition that
garnered several thousand sig-

natures in support of the water
bottle ban. Now, the EIC is
hoping to further its cause and
eventually present the proposal
before the University's Board of
Regents.
LSA junior Maggie Oliver,
chair of the EIC, wrote in an
e-mail interview that many
people don't realize the adverse
effects plastic water bottles
have on the local environment.

Alta Gracia provides
higher wages
for employees
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
One year after its founding,
fair-labor college clothing com-
pany Alta Gracia, which sells
apparel on campus, is continuing

its mission to provide higher-pay-
ing 'wages to its employees and
more jobs to a community in the
Dominican Republic, where the
company's factory is located.
Alta Gracia Founder Joe
Bozich, also the CEO of Knights
Apparel, said in a conference
call last night that the company
pays its workers a living wage
- approximately 340 percent
more than required by Domini-
can Republic law - which allows

the factory's workers to build
their own homes and support
their families. The company also
allows the employees to union-
ize. However, the company has
not yet been able to break even,
according to Donnie Hodge,,COO
of Knights Apparel and Alta Gra-
cia.
"We did not intend it to be a
non-profit, but it has (been) so
far," Hodge said.

Sava Lelcaj's career in the

What's your educational
background and what brought
you to Michigan?
I did my undergrad in his-
tory at Harvard, buttI was always
interested in psychology. Later I
did my Ph.D. in social and clinical
psychology in Brandeis. I came to
Michigan in the 1980s assa fellow
of Michigan Society of Fellows.
Then I worked in Counseling
and Psychological Services as a
counselor for several years before
becoming a teacher.
What classes do you teach?
A variety of courses since my
teaching began. The core course
being a first-year seminar offered
through the Residential College
called Listening to Holocaust
Survivors. It is based on the 35

years of my own work with Holo-
caust survivors beginning in the
1970s. The focus of the course is
a very close interpretation of sur-
vivors' memoirs and interview
transcripts.
What's the goal of the class?
The aim of this class is to listen
as closely an we can. How does
the context impact what survi-
vors say? What does each word
or phrase suggest? Students also
learn to listen better in general,
to appreciate the capacity of peo-
pie's communicating experience
and the barriers to being under-
stood.
What is your teaching phi-
losophy?
I see teaching as a conversa-
tion, especially in small courses

like a seminar. We typically have
about 16, students, and I get to
know them very well. Itts amaz-
ing that every year students come
up with new questions, issues and
different ways of looking atcthings
in the same course I have been
teaching for over 20 years. Some-
times I get lucky - students bring
up issues that are more interest-
log and sophisticated than what
I planned - and as a teacher, you
learn to go with that luck.
What's next for you?
Iwill be working in Montreal
this winter with a very large
project that involves survivors of
genocide - primarily Rwandans
and Cambodians.

An airline that reported suspi-

However, airport police

A demonstrator holds up a sign that reads in Creole "We say no to the occupation, long live free Haiti" during a protest
against the U.N. mission in Port-au-Prince, Haiti yesterday. Protesters calling for the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers
from Haiti clashed with police outside the earthquake-damaged Haitian National Palace.

Sexual assault,
cholera outbreak
sparked anger
toward troops
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) - Protesters calling for
the withdrawal of U.N. peace-
keepers from Haiti clashed with
police yesterday outside the
earthquake-damaged Haitian
National Palace.
The protesters hurled rocks
at Haitian police in riot gear,
and the officers responded by
firing volleys of tear gas canis-
ters toward the crowd of several
hundred demonstrators. As the
crowd dispersed, many protest-
ers fled into the Champs des
Mars, the park that became a
huge encampment of tents and
shanties following the January
2010 earthquake.
There did not appear to be
any serious injuries among pro-
testers, who said they wanted
to see a withdrawal of the U.N.
troops who have helped keep
order in Haiti since 2004, when
political violence engulfed the
country.
But a group of protesters

in a university near the plaza
carried out a young man to an
ambulance; minutes before, pro-
testers had lobbed rocks from
the building and riot police had
fired back with tear gas.
A passenger in the ambu-
lance said the man had been cut
by razor wire. Then the vehi-
tle sped off as demonstrators
pelted an oncoming riot police
truck with stones.
Haitian National Police
spokesman Frantz Lerebours
told The Associated Press that
he hadn't received any reports
of injuries.
Protesters said they were
angry over the alleged sexual
assault of an 18-year-old Hai-
tian man by U.N. peacekeepers
from Uruguay in the southwest-
ern town of Port-Salut in July.
They also expressed anger over
a cholera outbreak likely intro-
duced by a battalion from Nepal.
The outbreak has killed more
than 6,200 people since it sur-
faced last October, according to
the Health Ministry.
"We are doing a peaceful
march and asking for MINUS-
TAH to leave the country," said
protester Christo Junior Cadet,
referring to the U.N. force by its
French acronym.

The U.N. has 12,000 U.N.
military and police personnel
in Haiti but no peacekeepers
were in sight as the protesters
clashed with the Haitian police.
Haitian President Michel
Martelly is expected to ask for
a renewal of the U.N. mission's
mandate, which expires next
month.
The peacekeeping force has
been a fixture in Haiti following
a violent rebellion that ousted
former President Jean Bertrand
Aristide in 2004. The force in
Haiti has been a target of com-
plaints for years, but the criti-
cism has increased in recent
weeks after a cell phone video
surfaced showing several U.N.
soldiers holding down a young
Haitian man. It was not imme-
diately clear in the video what
else the soldiers may have been
doing.
The Wednesday protest came.
the same day the U.N. released
a statement saying that Secre-
tary-General Ban Ki-moon sent
a trio of senior-ranking officials
to Haiti to ensure that a "zero-
tolerance" policy on misconduct
is enforced.
The U.N., Haiti and Uruguay
are investigating the abuse alle-
gations.

USDA to offer meals
for low-income children

Schools, churches
to provide lunches
during summer
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -
Food can be scarce around the
Mendoza household during the
summer. School food service
worker Alina Mendoza loses
most of her hours and pay at the
same time her daughter stops
getting free meals at school.
That's why Mendoza was
excited this summer when a fed-
eral grant provided money for
her daughter and other children
to pick up backpacks full of food
each Friday from a local elemen-
tary school.
The grant was part of $6.3
million the U.S. Department of
Agriculture spent this year to
try to find new ways of making
sure children from low-income
families get enough to eat during
the summer. Of the 20.6 million
children nationwide who receive
free or reduced-price lunches,
less than one in five get meals
when school lets out, according
to the USDA.
The agency pays schools,
churches and other nonprofits to
serve summer meals to children
in low-income neighborhoods,
but that doesn't always work
because many children don't
have a way to get there each day,
said Crystal FitzSimons, who
overseas and studies summer
nutrition programs for the anti-
hunger nonprofit Food Research
and Action Center. In other
cases, the USDA hasn't been
able to find groups willing to run
summer meal programs.
11

The loss of school meals also
hits some families hard because
it comes when they are paying
more for child care, FitzSimons
said.
"Families who are already
stretching their dollar to make
ends meet find it even harder
because now they are having to
pay for meals that they don't nor-
mally have to pay for," she said.
To address the problem, the
USDA has been testing a num-
ber of new approaches in Kan-
sas, Missouri and 11 other states.
While some grant recipients
sent food home in backpacks,
others delivered meals to chil-
dren's homes or served them to
participants in arts and sports
programs.
Mendoza, 40, a single mom
from Topeka, Kan., said she tries
tostockup duringtheschoolyear
and stretch her supplies during
the summer. But the backpack
filled weekly with items such as
fruit cups and canned chicken
helped.
On Cape Cod, the local YMCA
dispatched a van to deliver
breakfasts and lunches, includ-
ing low-fat milk, locally grown
fruits and vegetables, and easy-
to-prepare entrees. The meals,
delivered two or three at a time,
fed 110 children seven days a
week.
Many of the children's parents
are unemployed or hold low-
paying service jobs in the area's
booming tourism industry.
Alberta Glover of Hyannis,
Mass., was out of work and tak-
ing classes until she recently
started a job as an assistant in
a medical office. Her two chil-
dren - ages 9 and 13 - received

meals.
"The program was a big help,"
Glover said. "They were getting
whole grains, fruits, dairy and
vegetables."
The USDA began testing
alternative ways of delivering
summer meals last year. New
data show the number of meals
served to children in Arkansas
jumped 40 percent from 2009 to
2010 after the USDA began pro-
viding an extra 50 cents per meal
to entice groups to offer meals
for a bigger chunk of the sum-
mer.
USDA spokeswoman Jean
Daniel said a common problem
has been groups shutting down
meal programs up to a month
before school starts.
In Arkansas, the state also
helped in 2010 by providing
transportation for welfare fami-
lies and kicking in extra money
so adults could eat with their
children.
In Mississippi, the number of
meals served increased by 5 per-
cent from 2009 to 2010 after the
USDA gave some groups extra
money to lure children with edu-
cational and recreational activi-
ties. The Mennonite Service
Center in rural Macon drew -
and was able to feed - 50 to 60
children a day with a mix of art,
music and sports programs.
Other states - Connecticut,
Michigan, Missouri, Oregon and
Texas - have piggy-backed on
food stamp and other aid pro-
grams to try to help hungry chil-
dren. Arizona and Ohio tested
sending food home in backpacks,
and Delaware and New York also
got grants to deliver food to chil-
dren's homes.

A temporary fix
Chrysler's two-tier payment isn't sustainable
he American auto industry's recovery has been placed in the
hands of its workers. In a move to stimulate the automotive
job market, Chrysler recently announced it would imple-
ment a two-tier wage system for its employees. The newest workers
will earn $14 per hour, and longtime employees will continue to
earn nearly double that amount. Union leaders have embraced the
change that will increase new hires and ensure job security for cur-
rent employees. Though the decision will boost Detroit's economy
in the immediate future, a two-tier wage system for employees who
do the same work is not a sustainable plan in the long run.

The real Ann Arbor

In a move to cut labor costs, Chrysler
believes paying new hires a flat rate will make
the company more competitive. For years,
members of the United Automobile Work-
ers have remained steadfast in their belief in
equal pay regardless of seniority. Due to the
slowed economy and high unemployment
rate, the U.A.W has made numerous conces-
sions to ensure the solvency of automakers
and job security for its employees. In a state-
ment to The New York Times on Sept. 12,
Chrysler states there have been no changes in
the quality of cars coming off the line despite
the pay disparity.
The move is a simple solution to a vast eco-
nomic problem. The American auto indus-
try has been on the decline since the influx
of foreign automakers in the United States.
Three years ago, the question of solvency was
answered: A government-backed bailout for
two of the "Big Three." With the bailout came
a slow and steady recoveryandthe proverbial
rebirth of the American automaker. Prior to
the economic crisis, the U.A.W. was opposed
to its members receiving different pay for the
same work. Yet, due to the unemployment cri-
sis,theunionhasdone whatisbestforitswork-
ers and has found new avenues to employment.
The U.A.W. understands that any employment

is better than no employment.
Though Chrysler's decision to hire more
employees through its new wage system will
help in the short term, it's not sustainable
in the future. About 12 percent of Chrysler
employees earn the lower wage, but the num-
ber of employees hired under the lower-tier
wage system is expected to increase dramati-
cally in the coming years. The U.A.W. Presi-
dent, Bob King, said that an increase in the
entry-level wages is a top priority in nego-
tiations for a new national contract. Chrys-
ler is putting people to work now, but when
the economy recovers, it can no longer take
advantage of the unemployment rate.
The two-tier wage system should not
become the norm. Chrysler and the U.A.W.
must create a long-term plan for integration
of the wage classes. While the new plan is
acceptable during a time when the economy
is faltering, a two-tier wage system promotes
inequality, and inequality cannot be a long-
term business practice.
Chrysler's two-tier wage system will allow
the company to become more competitive and
ensure paychecks for thousands of Americans.
Once the company is on solid footing, it should
reinstate normal pay disbursements and put
employee compensation on an even footing.

Have you been tempted to
make AnnArbor your
refuge from the rest of
the world? I know Ihave. They say
this is 28 square
miles sur-
rounded by real-
ity. The shock
attached to the -
crimes around ,
campus this
year - shocking
as they are - is JOEL
itself a measure
of the comfort BATTEM
we usually keep.
Yet you don't
have to go far away to get schooled
in the tough times we're inhabiting.
A 20-minute drive from campus
will getyouto the Willow Run plant,
a sprawling property just north of
1-94. This factory, which Henry
Ford constructed to build bombers
for World War II, was once the larg-
est single room on our planet. After
the war, it served General Motors for
more than 50 years. It's been empty
since the company went bankrupt.
In the adjoining school district, Wil-
low Run Community Schools, three-
quarters of the students qualify for
free and reduced-price lunches.
Along the Huron River, about
eight miles from The Rock, you can
walk through an isolated south-
ern section of Ypsilanti's Riverside
Park where field lights tower over a
meadow that is beginning to sprout
small trees. Not too long ago, this
was a baseball diamond. However,
the city ran out of money to operate
its recreation department in 2003.
The path along the river is lined
with toppled lamp posts.
At the edge of Ann Arbor, in a

wooded area at the crux of I-94 and
M-14,you'll findCampTakeNotice,a
homeless community where dozens
of people live in tents year-round.
The downtown homeless shelter has
only enough beds for a fraction of
the people who need them, and the
camp's residents find value in taking
governance into their own hands.
The camp isn't as big as those that
sprung up around the country dur-
ing the Great Depression, but it's a
reminder of the difficult conditions
swirling around the outskirts of our
little oasis of learning.
Much of life here can seem
removed from the storm and stress
of a troubled world. In the blur of
libraries, cafes, classrooms and
rental units many of us inhabit,
"reality" often feels like something
alien. Lying on Ingalls Mall, I can
stare up into the sky and imagine
that the whole universe is a kind of
garden, where the grass is always
manicured to perfection and the
only moral dilemma is whether or
not one should feed the squirrels.
Yet even here in the city, amid the
$12 sandwiches and sparkling new
collegiate towers, you can find hints
of a less rosy reality. Privileged spac-
es don't maintain themselves, after
all. I think of the makeshift bed I saw
once in the basement of a restaurant a
few steps from the Diag and the small
army of custodial staff wiping down
classrooms where they've never sat.
Ann Arbor natives haven't all
been equally privileged either,
despite the stereotype and the
steady work of gentrification. On
the corner of Fourth Avenue and
Ann Street you'll find a historical
marker commemorating the time
when the block was home to Ann

Arbor's African American business
district - back when an unwrit-
ten code barred blacks from living
south of Miller Road. Now that the
tanneries and slaughterhouses are
gone, most of the cheap real estate
that remains lies at the city's edge,
especially toward the east. Despite
the two Whole Foods we have, the
city isn't an undifferentiated island
of affluence, at least not yet.
Harsh conditions
surround our
campus oasis.

That brings me back to the old
saying. There sure is a lot of money
within these 28 square miles, and
some distinctive cultural norms. But
the truth is there's only one reality
out there, and Ann Arbor is part of
it. By perceiving this town, and our-
selves, as wholly insulated from the
whirlwind of the world beyond, we
obscure the fact that we're all part of
one phenomenon, and that austerity
and abundance are arelationship, not
independent conditions.
As students, we're presumably
here to learn something aboutwhat's
real, which can be a scary enterprise
and one that motivates us to seek
refuge from the forces shaping our
world in an imagined sort of Swit-
zerland. But the first step to the real
might be seeing that we're already
part of it, whether we like it or not.

It was over two centuries ago - at the
threshold of the First Industrial Revolution -
that demographer Thomas Malthus augured
the dire consequences of unchecked population
growth. His initial worry was that the number
of people in developed countries would even-
tually exceed the countries' agricultural means
and force a regression to subsistence living.
This tipping point, dubbed a "Malthusian
catastrophe" by modern demographers, would
supplant our cars with horses and our super-
markets with backyard farms. Though new
technologies have allowed food production to
keep up with population growth, Malthus's old
model has been adapted to fit new scenarios,
most notably the rate of oil production. Even
some of the more optimistic estimates warn
that global oil production will peak within
the next 10 years. Couple this startling time-
frame with the fact that the world's population
growth rate won't stabilize until 2050 and will
later peak at 9 billion people, and it's hard not
to wonder whether our beloved tech-craze may
be on its last leg.
Of course, there are those who claim that
technology always trumps the threat of disas-
ter, just as it did with Malthus's agricultural
model. Some point to the popularity of hybrid
cars as an indication of change for the better.
But most of the electricity that's used to manu-
facture and (in the case of plug-in electric mod-
els) power these cars is made by coal power
plants. What's the sense of trading one limited,
dirty resource for another?
Others insist that the efficiency of nuclear
power plants will save us, but the upturn of
natural disasters predicted by global warming
experts has called the whole process into ques-
tion. The near meltdown of Japan's Fukushima
reactor shows us that no amount of microman-
agement can guarantee safe nuclear fission. In
fact, Germany has already committed to dis-
mantling its 17 nuclear reactors by 2022 in light
of overwhelming public concern.
What are we to do in light of these circum-
stances? It hardly seems fair to refuse India
and China pieces of the prosperity pie that the
United States has buried its face in for the last
century. But if the growing middle classes of
these and other developing countries repeat
our mistakes and demand their own cars,
trucks and SUVs, the amount of oil consumed
by their immense populations will make past
complaints of American excess look like myo-

pic temper tantrums. Even the threat of oil
depletion would pale next to the consequences
of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions
these countries are capable of.
Solar, wind and biomass energies are among
the safest, most sustainable alternatives to our
current system. Critics dismiss these sources
as expensive, undeveloped and inefficient. But
when you consider that the highest-paying
major over the course of a career for today's
college student is in petroleum engineering, it's
clear that the problem is one of bad priorities
rather than feasibility. In a society that wor-
ships the god of the bottom line, it shouldn't
come as a surprise that the best and brightest
are turning down the opportunity to develop
alternative energies when the best money is
dirty money.
My hope is that we abandon nuclear power
and foreign oil and follow the precedent set
by Germany. As the world's first renewable
energy economy, Germany derives 17 percent
of its electrical power from solar panel tech-
nology. The program welcomes open partici-
pation with a "feed-in tariff" plan that gives
landowners the right to house subsidized elec-
tric generators (wind turbines, solar panels,
etc.) on their property. The landowner is paid
for anyenergy produced on his or her property,
including the energy landowners use for their
own purposes. Plus, there's an added bonus if
the landowner produces enough electricity to
feed extra power into the public grid.
Germany's multi-party system allowed
politicians with a measure of reason to win
office and shape public opinion to ensure the
program's success. It's easy to shun our own
agency by blaming our federal government
for lax energy policies. But let's face it: We
can't expect a two-party system to champion
our best interests when politicians on both
sides of the coin have burgeoning invest-
ments in big oil. I'm not suggesting we over-
haul a system that's seen Americans through
generations of struggle. I'd instead urge
everyone who's not completely shortsighted
to rise up and demand the system address the
problems of the present day, with a collective
voice too loud to ignore - louder than cor-
porate lobbyists, diesel engines and the ham-
mering of pump jacks.

Embrace the changes ahead

Coming back to campus to
start our senior year, my
friends and I are a little
stunned. Many of us are returning
to Ann Arbor
after semes-
ters abroad and
acclimating
to the absence
of our gradu- 4
ated friends. -
Between hugs
and house par- LIBBY
ties, we can't ASHTON
ignore the epic
finality this
year represents.
When the last class left, we
inherited their senior status even
though it doesn't quite feel right.
Even as a "senior," I don't feel sig-
nificantly surer of my dream job
than I did three years ago. But
because I know I'll have to walk
somewhere once I step off the grad-
uation stage, I fear I'll stumble into
some professional life that I'm not
sure I want. As a student of a system
that guided me here tightly and a
citizen of a country that encourages
- if not requires - a salaried, com-
mittal lifestyle, I'm having trouble
internalizing the "it'll all work out"
mantra my parents prescribe. If the
last five years of college graduates
have taught us anything, it's that
we'll be lucky to find a job - let
alone one that makes us happy.
Shouldn't we know by now what
we want to be when we grow up?
And shouldn't we have learned how
to get there? I can't help but expect
myself to build a makeshift trajec-
tory to jump on to once the one I've
followed for the last 18 years has
run its course. And I want a guar-

antee that in whatever direction I
head, I'll find fulfillment and mean-
ing - oh, and a livelihood. So while
we're celebrating the culmination
of our entire education, we're also
terrified that we're standing on the
most profound pivot point of our
lives.
But when I take my deep breath
(also part of my parents' prescrip-
tion) and stop panicking like I'm
about to be driven off a cliff into
the abyss of real adulthood, I can
see my fears of change, failure and
the unknown for what they are.
Senioritis, which feels way less
fun and more anxiety-ridden than
I remember from high school, only
enhances feelings that are common
to all people at every stage of life.
To lean into those feelings by facing
the changes and challenges head on
is to grow, albeit uncomfortably.
To question where you're headed
in life and whether or not you'll
find success once you get there is
not unique to college seniors. I met
two 26 year olds this summer who
recently quit their high-paying jobs
(one at a consulting firm, the other
at a record label) to take and cre-
ate jobs that made them want to
work longer hours for less money. It
would have been safer and probably
easier for each of them to stay with
their previous jobs, but they chose
to create the change they wanted
in their lives. The complete con-
trol we have over our post-graduate
steps allows us to pivot whenever
we want to. Few of us can make our
dream jobs appear from thin air,
but then again, some of us can.
Nancy Lublin, the CEO of DoSo-
mething.org (the non-profit where
I worked this summer) began her

career as a leader in the non-profit
sector when she was 23 years old.
She started Dress for Success, a non-
profit that provides professional
attire to low-income women, with a
$5,000 inheritance check and little
experience. When her organization
grew up and no longer needed her
leadership for its survival, she left
to take over DoSomething.org, the
leading non-profit for youth and
social change. Nancy Lublin chose
to pivot when her career was climb-
ing because she missed the excite-
ment of building something.
Question where
you're headed
in life.
Rather than fearing the end
of college, I think we're feeling
overwhelmed by our soon-xr-be
sudden gain in freedom and pos-
sibility. That freedom requ res
decision-making not just leading up
to graduation but every day there-
after. Rather than feeling pressure
to make the right career choice for
the next 10 years, we should con-
centrate on becoming even clearer
about what work engages us the
most. The only real threat we face
upon graduation is allowing our
fears to paralyze us from making
the scary decisions that always pre-
cede success.

The AAU has 61 members that

and other criteria.
In an e-mail interview Perl-

against Nebraska and knows she
had the best interest of the AAU
in mind.
"Mary Sue and I have been
friends," Perlman wrote. "Her
husband is a graduate of the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
I do not know how she finally
voted but I am sure she voted in
good faith in accordance with
what she thought was best for

Despite the company's low prof-

demand for the fair-labor pro-

"We hear the students say they
want the opportunity to support a
brand," Hodge said. "We've given
them the opportunity."
Barnes & Noble bookstore in
the Michigan Union is the only
store on campus to carry Alta
Gracia apparel. In a November
30, 2010 article in The Michigan
Daily, Rishi Narayan, co-owner of
Underground Printing and Moe
Sports Shops, said he doesn't sell
Alta Gracia clothing because cus-
tomers haven't asked him to carry
apparel that is made under fair-
labor conditions.
"The trend is more towards the
'being environmental' aspect of
clothing and the sustainability,"
Narayan said at the time.
Scott Nova, executive director

University of Wisconsin-Madi-
son also declined to comment on
the grounds that Martin is now
president of Amherst College
and no longer affiliated with
Wisconsin.
The Big Ten unanimously
voted to invite Nebraska to
become a member nine months
before the AAU meeting that
resulted in Nebraska losing its
AAU membership. Perlman
wrote that not being an AAU
member will not affect Nebras-
ka's relationship with its Big Ten
colleagues.
"Thiswill have, and has had,
no impact on our relationship
with Michigan or with the Big
Ten," Perlman wrote.
Perlman called the tim-
ing "awkward," but said he is
excited by the opportunity to
work with the Big Ten, despite
Nebraska's removal from the
AAU.
"I don't agree with the AAU
decision, but we are excited
about the opportunities to be a
member of the Big Ten and to
lead in academics in those areas

where we have unique creden-
tials to do so," Perlman wrote.
He added that he thinks
Nebraska's removal from the
AAU potentially had to do with
the fact that its medical school
is located in Omaha, Neb. and is
separate from the main campus
in Lincoln. He wrote that the
AAU does not value the agricul-
tural research of land-grantuni-
versities like Nebraska as much
as schools with strengths in the
medical field.
"The AAU failed to fol-
low their own rules, failed to
apply the standards established
for membership and failed to
account for the fact that their
qualitative membership criteria
can not account for the diversity
of higher education," Perlman
wrote.
Toiv said he disagrees with
the notion that the AAU pri-
oritizes universities with strong
medical programs and facilities
over land-grant institutions,
adding that most of the schools
on the list are public universi-
ties.

Brown stressed that even
though "piggy-backing" - hold-
ing the door for a person who
may not be authorized to enter
the building - will still occur, she
believes the new card system will
significantly reduce the number of
unauthorized entries.
Kirstin Knag, an Mcard office
assistant, said the process of get-
ting a new Mcard is fairly simple.
If students have an old Mcard,
they will have a new one printed.
If students do not have an old
Mcard, they will be charged $20
and will need to present either a
valid driver's license or passport
to receive their new card.
According to the University's
Office of Public Affairs, about

35,000 new cards have been
issued and about 45,000 cards
still need to be replaced.
Incoming students who were
issued an Mcard for the first time
over the summer already have a
smart Mcard, Brown said. How-
ever, all students are encouraged
to visit mcard.umich.edu and
compare their current Mcard
with the pictures displayed on the
site to see if they need to obtain a
new card.
Though the process is not com-
plicated, Knag said because the
office can only print one card at a
time, lines can build quickly and
students may have to wait.
"I would just like to stress
patience," she said.
To make the process more con-
venient for students, the Mcard
center temporarily opened a sta-
tion in the Chemistry Building

this month. On Central Campus,
students can also visit the Central
Campus Recreation Building and
the Mcard center in the Student
Activities Building to receive their
new cards. On North Campus,
cards can be replaced at Pierpont
Commons, and students and fac-
ulty on South Campus can go to
Wolverine Tower.
Brown added that though the
University is adding the extra
security measure, everyone on
campus should report potentially
suspicious behavior.
"Anytime students or anyone
in our community are seeing sus-
picious behavior, they should call
the police right away," Brown
said. "If people can report sus-
picious behavior quickly to the
police, then we have a better shot
at identifying perpetrators and
gettingthem off our campus."



of the Workers Rights Consor-
tium - a labor rights watchdog
that reports to more than 175
colleges and universities in the
United States including the Uni-
versity of Michigan - was also on
the conference call last night. He
said that stores have few excuses
for not carrying the Alta Gracia
clothingline, which he noted is the
only collegiate apparel company
marked with a Worker Rights Con-
sortium certification tag.
"There's no question in my mind
that they can make room for this
unique product that is demonstrat-
ing respect for the moral values of
universities in a way that no other
product on their shelves is doing,"
Nova said. "So if a store is saying
that they're not carrying the prod-
uct because consumers haven't
come to clamor for it, in my view
as a labor rights advocate, that's a
cop-out."
When asked what Alta Gracia is
doing to promote the clothing line
to students, Bozich said the com-
pany has reached out to university

administrators and students.
"We have a social media cam-
paign, we have an internship
program ... I think the key is just
making people aware that A, it's
available (and) B, why it's unique
and different," Bozich said.
Despite the company's difficul-
ties in makinga profit, its workers
say Alta Gracia has changed their
community.
Speaking through a translator,
Maritza Vargas, the leader of Alta
Gracia's union and an employee
at the factory, said workers at the
company are reaping the benefits
of a living wage that allows them
to support their families, build
homes and further their edu-
cations. The benefits have also
trickled down to the members
of their families, who can have
health insurance and other ben-
efits.
"Our children have been able to
dream of getting a university edu-
cation," Vargas said. "We feel that
we can provide our kids with the
childhood they deserve."

MSA
From Page 1A
"600,000 bottles of water were
purchased in the fiscal year of
2010 at (the University of) Michi-
gan, and the ability to change this
number to zero would not only
help save the ecosystems that
are being destroyed for the bottle
water industry, but educate stu-
dents about why bottled water is
environmentally degrading," Oli-
ver wrote.
She added that since Michigan
is surrounded by five bodies of
fresh water, residents may have
forgotten that water is a precious
resource.
"EIC has putthe focus on water
bottles because water should not
be a privatized resource," Oliver
wrote. "With just one extra step
by grabbing a reusable water
bottle to use instead of purchas-
ing one, our University can make
a difference."
However, members of the EIC
or MSA didn't keep the Univer-
sity's Office of Campus Sustain-
ability apprised of their recent
activity. Andy Berki, manager of
the office of Campus Sustainabil-
ity wrote in an e-mail interview
that the people who work in the
office have met with Oliver to
talk about forming a relationship
between the EIC and the Office of
Campus Sustainability, but there
was no mention of the resolu-
tion to support the elimination of
water bottles.
"If we had been contacted by
MSA, we would have gladly par-

ticipated in conversation around
the challenges associated with
a water bottle ban on campus,"
Berki wrote.
If the University's Board of
Regentsdoes agree to ban the sale
of bottled water on campus, this
would mean that more than 300
campus buildings would need
to add at least one water bottle
refill station, according to Berki.
The money needed to install the
refill stations would come from
different departments depend-
ing on where the stations will be
located, he wrote. Refill stations
in the residence halls would be
funded by the Division of Student
Affairs, those in athletic facilities
would come from Athletics and
stations in the Engineering Col-
lege would be funded by the Gen-
eral Fund, Berki added.
Some campus buildings such
as Mason Hall and the Michigan
Union already have refill stations
that were installed last year as part
ofeffortsbythe University's Planet
Blue program. For students who
live on campus, refillable water
bottle stations are available in
places such as the Ross School of
Business and the Michigan Union.
Berki added that a reusable
water bottle is the easiest way for
students to be environmentally
conscious and students should
take advantage of the clean city
water.
"We are fortunate that Ann
Arbor has clean, high qual-
ity drinking water right from the
tap," he wrote.
However, Berki noted that
though the plan benefits the

environment, it would limit prof-
its among University divisions -
such as the Athletic Department
and the Michigan Union - that
sell water bottles. Despite this
and other concerns, including
banning bottled water may cause
students to purchase unhealthy
drinks, Oliver remains positive
about the outcome of the initia-
tive.
"We look forward to continu-
ing our efforts with the ultimate
goal for the regents of the Uni-
versity to make a similar ban
on campus soon," Oliver wrote.
"We have a few campaigns we
are working on that will further
the knowledge of this issue to the
University and create pressure
for leaders at the University to
make environmentally-conscious
decisions."
Though the resolution was
passed unanimously by MSA,
many students aren't aware ofthe
efforts. When asked to be inter-
viewed by The Michigan Daily,
several students declined to com-
ment because of lack of knowl-
edge on the topic.
Engineering sophomore Joe
Stevens mentioned the benefits
of water bottle filling stations
on campus. He said the spigots
would encourage students like
him to carry around reusable
water bottles.
"I've-got two or three (reus-
able) water bottles in my room
that I could carry with me, but I
just don't," Stevens said, "There
doesn't seem to be a really good
system in place to make (reusable
water bottles) convenient."



SAVA
From Page 1A
did every job," Lelcaj said. "And
then through college, I managed
restaurants and bartended and
did private events and things
like that."
Unable to find a job as a food
critic after graduation, Lel-
caj began helping people open
restaurants. After a restaurant
she operated in Hazel Park,
Mich. fizzled out in 2007, Lelcaj
moved to Ann Arbor at age 23
and opened her own restaurant,
Sava's State Street Cafe, where
CVS is now located. Her busi-
ness moved across the street in
Sept. 2009.
"In that time I really got to
know the people of Ann Arbor. -
I got to know the students, and
the locals, so I really got a better
sense of Ann Arbor," Lelcaj said.
After two-and-a-half years
of settling into the city, Lel-
caj expanded her caf6 from a
43-seat restaurant to a 300-seat
restaurant and renamed it Sava's
Restaurant. Lelcaj, now 28, said
the past five years of owning and
operating her own restaurant
has been "a lot of work," but see-
ing it develop into the business it
is today makes it worthwhile.
"The most rewarding aspect is
watching the business grow and
watching our hard work and our
ideas be received well by the pub-
lic and having people really-enjoy
this place," Lelcaj said. "Becom-
ing a part of people's lives for
the day for a rehearsal dinner, a
graduation party... that to me is
the most rewarding part."
She added that even though
the restaurant is now well estab-

lished, she approaches her busi-
ness as an ever-evolving entity.
Though Lelcaj is currently focus-
ing on a successful opening for
babo, she said she plans to open
more businesses in the future.
"I'm constantly trying to
get better and whenever I get
comfortable, I think of ways
to improve and we never stop
improving, we never stop get-
ting better," Lelcaj said. "I don't
think we'll stop at the market
... because there's just so many
other things I want to bring
to this town and I want to be a
part of in one way or another, so
I think that there will be other
adventures for sure."
With the opening of babo, she
said she hopes to offer the com-
munity Michigan-made prod-
ucts as well as specialty imported
goods such as spices and cured
meats. According to Lelcaj, the
market will also sell prepared
sandwiches and other items for
quick meals. Lelcaj explained
how restaurants in bigger cities,
especially New York City, where
she grew up, inspired the con-
cept for the market.
"I travel quite a bit and check
out restaurants all over the
country to see what they are
doing and what's new in other
cities," Lelcaj said. "One of the
things I kept coming across was
this market-restaurant concept
in bigger cities."
While Sava's Restaurant won't
be physically connected to the
market, Lelcaj said the two
businesses will be intertwined
through their products. The
market will provide most of the
food to the restaurant, and the
restaurant will package and sell
its original products at the mar-

ket. Sava's Greek salad dressing
and orange beet and ginger juice
are just two of the products cus-
tomers will be able to purchase
at babo, Lelcaj said.
The market will offer quality
products while remaining with-
in the price range of students
and the community - a balance
Lelcaj said she feels is realistic.
"It will absolutely be afford-
able," Lelcaj said. "It is definitely
going to be high-end, but for me,
high-end is more of an experi-
ence than a price point ... You
can find really great products at
greatprices,you justhave to look
a little harder, and we're spend-
ing so much time on that."
Lelcaj added that other spe-
cialty markets in the area, such as
Zingerman's Deli, Sparrow Mar-
ket and Replenish, will not nec-
essarily be competition for babo
because she is interested in sell-
ing different products to create
more options in the community.
"We don't really want to com-
pete ... we just want to add more
optionsto this town so that when
people are thinking about shop-
ping ... they aren't automatically
thinking about leaving town,"
Lelcaj said.
She added that she believes
customers will appreciate the
specialty options babo will bring
to the community and the care
her team has put into selecting
each product they intend to sell.
"I feel like it's going to offer
something really special to this
community," Lelcaj said. "We're
not just picking products, we're
curating a product list for people.
We're putting so much thought
into it, and I think that will be
recognized right away and peo-
ple will really appreciate it."

Before last weekend, Pereira
was the only Michigan player
to have MICHIGAN 4
made DETROIT 1
friends
with the back of the net - a fact
that did not go unnoticed by
Michigan coach Steve Burns.
"We're looking for those
offensive personalities to step
up," Burns said after last week-
end's 2-2 tie with Georgetown.
"We're challenging those guys
to step up."
On Wednesday evening, a
different Wolverine stepped up
to that challenge, not once, not
twice, but three times.
Unheralded junior forward
Etienne Lussiez put the team on
his back, completing a hat trick
and leading Michigan (2-4-1) to
a 4-1victory over Detroit (3-3).
"He put a great performance
in," Burns said. "Etienne came
in and put that effort in on

offensively but defensively. He

so far as to say that his second

season.
"That was a special one he

Entering the match, the big-

ines was whether or not they
could match the physicality of
the Titans for a whole 90 min-
utes.
Physical teams tend to wear
down their opposition, and
coupled with the rain, stamina

Michigan has played its best
soccer of the year in the last
week, but the real test will be on
Friday.
The Wolverines have a quick
turnaround before playing No.

for a crucial pre-conference
match.
"I really like the fact that
our team is getting better and

have a ways to go but the things
we have been working on are
improving, and that's part of the
joy of coaching, to coach a team
that recognizes it is getting bet-

Michigan coach Brady Hoke and the Wolverises are eff to a2-0 start, but these victories have bees far from ordinary.

quarterback Denard Robinson
was down the stretch against
the Irish, how coach Brady Hoke
is a genius for going for the
winning touchdown with eight
seconds left instead of kicking
a field goal for the tie, how the
defense came up with huge plays
when Michigan needed it most,
how Michigan is back ... It goes
on.
These are all valid things
to be excited about. And ifa
football team was judged solely
on one fourth-quarter perfor-
mance, the Wolverines may
very well be ranked No.1 in the
nation.
Maybe I'm confused, but isn't
there more toa football season
than one quarter? My sources
tell me yes, but listening to most
Michigan fans talk, I swear only
one quarter has been played this
year and only that quarter mat-
ters. Forever.
Upon review, I have deter-
mined that yes, the rest of the
season matters too. I've also
determined that winningone
rivalry game early in the sea-
son may give ateama momen-
tumboost that could catapult
it to appear better than it actu-
ally is. And I've concluded that
it gives fans a reason to believe
their team can beat any team
in the nation and that their
quarterback can take down
Hercules.
But here's the kicker: One
great quarter of football
doesn't wipe away a team's
blemishes. And the Wolver-
ines have a lot of those as they
prepare to take on Eastern
Michigan this Saturday at
Michigan Stadium.
It is still early in the season,
so it's hard to judge a team
based on two games. (Just one
according to NCAA statistics
because of the rain-shortened
win over Western Michigan.
The Big Ten, however, counts
that as a full game. Yes, I'm
confused too.)
But some of these statistics
are just too hard to ignore.
Sure, some of the Big Ten
teams started off the season
with two cupcakes.
But many had some tough
opponents: Indiana against
Virginia, Iowa against Iowa
State, Penn State against Ala-
bama, Minnesota against USC,
to name a few.
And still the Wolverines
remain at the bottom of the
'pack in many statistics.
Ninth in the Big Ten in
total defense. Tenth in rush-
ing defense. Ninth in passing
defense. Eleventh in pass
defense efficiency. Tenth in
kickoff returns.
Eleventh in kickoff cover-
age. Ninth in penalties. Tenth
in rushing offense (Robinson
was first last year in the Big
Ten). Dead last in first downs.
Dead last in time of possession
- by a mile.
And, of course, last in field
goals made.
Everyone knew the defense

would have its troubles. Coming
off a year in which the defense
ranked 110th nationally and
with a new coordinator in Greg
Mattison and a new 4-3 scheme,
it was going to take some time
for the Wolverines to gel. So
while Michigan would've liked
to get off to a better start defen-
sively, it's no huge surprise it's
had its struggles so far.
Special teams have been
a disaster the last two years,
and so far, it hasn't been much
better, as the Wolverines have
struggled in nearly every aspect
of the kicking and punting game.
Michigan has yet to attempt
afield goal, mainlybecause it's
5-for-5 in red-zone touchdowns
and hasn't needed to rely on the
kicking game.
Possiblythe biggest concern
is the offense. Like the defense,
it's adjusting to a new scheme
- what offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges now refers to as
a "hybrid" scheme - a mix
between the spread offense and
the West Coast offense. And
like the defense, it should take a
little time to gel.
But so far, it's been all or
nothing. The running backs
have been ineffective for the
most part, except for a couple
long runs against the Broncos.
Robinson can't seem to find any
room to run.
The receivers are either
catching 40-yard bombs or
they're invisible.
The Michigan offense can't
put together a sustained drive;
last Saturday, the Wolverines
had just two drives with more
than four plays - an unheard of
statistic.
That means more time spent
on the field for the defense. If
your team is going to survive on
such few plays, you better have
an incredible defense. And this
team clearly does not, at least
not yet.
Michigan has done some good
things, too. The defense has
created turnovers (it's first in
the Big Ten with three intercep-
tions). The offensive line has
only allowed one sack. At times,
Robinson has shown the ability
to throw the ball accurately.
And this team has proved it
has the ability to play well in
pressure-packed situations - a
characteristic of any champion-
ship team.
But maybe most importantly,
the Wolverines - the coaches
and the players - know they're
nowhere near where they need
to be, and they need to continue
to improve, starting Saturday
against the Eagles.
"We could blame (our strug-
gles) on (the fact that) this is
the first year of new coaches,
but we're all in college for a
reason," redshirt sophomore
Taylor Lewan said after practice
on Tuesday. "We were recruited
here to do something.
"It's our jobs, not the coaches
jobs, to get ourselves in gear."
Just hold the champagne for
now.

Bruised and broken, Woolfolk will play

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Troy Woolfolk looked like a
beaten man - a long scar ran
across his nose, his right hand
was wrapped in a cast and both
ankles have been injured in the
last 13 months.
. "I've got to start carrying
around a rabbit's foot because
this isn't working out too good,"
Woolfolk said.
His sprained right ankle is
the least of his
worries after NOTEBOOK
last week. On
Thursday, he landed awkwardly
on his right hand, breaking a
bone.
Just "bad luck," he said.
Doctors told him he'd be in the
cast for four weeks, but the brash
Woolfolk said he usually takes
two weeks off what the doctors
tell him.
Then he pointed to where he
thought the break occurred - a
bone, midway between the ring
and pinky fingers.
"I'm not really sure," he said.
"I'm not a doctor. I just break the
bones."
At least Woolfolk can poke
fun at his situation. He certainly
isn't letting it ruin his fifth-year
senior season, after he missed all
of last season with a broken left
ankle.
Before Saturday's game
against Notre Dame, Woolfolk
went up to defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison and said, "Coach,
you can count on me. I'll go."
"I just felt like I didn't want
to let my team down," Woolfolk
said. "I felt like I did that last
year, and I feel like I have an
important role on this team.
To add insult to injury, Wool-
folk's helmet was kicked off
during the game and the same
player's cleat caught his face -
leaving Woolfolk with a busted
lip and nose.
And the cast wasn't helping
matters. It only got in the way
when he was tackling.

"I guess I just have to get over
the mental block and trust my
hand that I can tackle," Woolfolk
said. "Just like my ankle. When-
ever you have a problem, you're
scared to use it.
"And I feel like I was, I don't
want to say soft, but not as physi-
cal as I usually was out there,
because (the cast) kind of took
away my tackling ability a little
bit. But I just have to get them
down any way possible."
So far this week Woolfolk
participated fully in practice on
Tuesday and the coaches were
excited to see how well Woolfolk
has responded by playing, and
playing well, through his inju-
ries.
"After watching the film, Troy
Woolfolk played unbelievable for
a guy with one hand," Mattison
said. "I mean, he made one tackle
with one hand that might have
broke. I was proud of him. He's a
Michigan man."
He may be a Michigan man,
but he's a beaten man too.
"It's a rough day out there, but
that's what you expect," Wool-
folk said. "You've got to go out
there and give it 100 percent.
Your body may pay the toll, but
it's all for Michigan."

sive tackle Will Campbell and
asked a question that may have
seemed a bit naive.
"Is that the most you've ever
played?" asked Hoke.
"Yes," Campbell responded.
"Well, t guess t should've
known that," Hoke said Wednes-
day.
Campbell played a large role
on the defensive line perhaps for
the first time in his career Satur-
day, after an offseason in which
the Michigan coaching staff
gushed about how much poten-
tial the 6-foot-5, 322-pound tack-
le had. On Saturday, he pushed
the pocket several times and
made one key fumble recovery.

Fifth-year senior cornerback Troy Woolfolk has a gash across his nose from when his facemask came off on Saturday and a receiver's cleats caught him in the face.

"I thought that when he went
in, he gave us a spark," Mattison
said. "I thought he played with a
lot of passion. And like I've said
all along, that's a big body that
can move.
"I do believe he'll probably get
more playing time. We're rotat-
ing anyhow, but I do think that
he's earned by what he showed
right there. The biggest thing
these guys have to do is earn it
by how they practice. The game
is the reward for how you prac-
tice."
DISGUISING DISASTERS: The
same play - a base coverage dis-
guised as a blitz - yielded an
interception early in the game
against Notre Dame and Matti-
son wanted to try it again later,
with the game on the line.
He knew the Fighting Irish
would expect a blitz the closer
they drove in Michigan territory,
so Mattison decided to do what
he thought Notre Dame wouldn't

expect.
Plus, he had just blitzed the
play before, so he wanted to show
blitz and then pull out and maybe
get another interception.
"We didn't execute it as well
as we did the first time and they
hit it," Mattison said Tuesday,
recalling Notre Dame's go-ahead
touchdown pass with 30 seconds
.left in the game. "I'll be the first
to tell youI'mnot always100 per-
cent. And if it was all over again,
I wouldn't have done that."
Disguising his blitzes is only
something Mattison will do if he
thinks his defenders understand
the basic defense first. Then he'll
show them how to line up one
way and play another.
Mattison's blitzes have saved
Michigan in both of its games so
far this season, forcing turnovers
when the Wolverines needed
them most. But he has also dialed
up pressures that have left huge
holes up the middle in the run-

ning game.
So, even for the savviest of
defensive minds, football is
always a game of chess.
"I'll be dead honest with you,
there are some times calls that
a guy makes that you say after-
wards, 'God, I wish I wouldn't
have made that call,' " Mattison
said.
On Saturday, at least, a stun-
ning finish saved Mattison from
a few sleepless nights.
FRESH RUNNING BACKS:
Hoke still doesn't have a lead
running back, and he hasn't
ruled out either of his two fresh-
man running backs who have yet
to see the field ahead of a crowd-
ed bunch of veterans.
Hoke said he might consider
playing freshmen Justice Hayes
and Thomas Rawls at some point
this season, burning a redshirt
season.
"It always depends on how
fast they learn, maturity wise

and all of those things," Hoke
said. "Depending on where we
get, they may play.
"Rawls is a strong runner and
he's got good vision, good bal-
ance. He's got pretty good burst.
Justice is a guy who's got great
quickness, catches the ball well.
He's doing a lot of stuff on our
look-team, sometimes lining up
at wideout."
THE RETURN OF CAM AND
FITZ: Michigan may be getting
two starters back from injury
this week.
Redshirt sophomore lineback-
er Cam Gordon, who has missed
the first two games of the season
due to a back injury, looks ready
to make his first start of the sea-
son Saturday.
And redshirt sophomore run-
ning back Fitz Toussaint, who
ran for 80 yards as the starter
against Western Michigan,
practiced Tuesday and should
be ready to play as well.

How the University's

Ann Arbor is home to
one of America's most

Saturday at 8 p.m., the
Ann Arbor Symphony
Orchestra will perform
a work by William
Bolcom, a University

gram are Schumann's
cello concerto, featuring
cellist Julie Albers, and
Shostakovich's tragic

Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.

- the Triple Play Reuben. Corned beef,
Pastrami, Switzerland Swiss, Jarlsberg
Cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing
on grilled sourdough rye. It's a real good
sandwich. This Reuben is humble yet
shines with the grace of a superstar, like
the quiet sixth man on the team who turns
out to be Magic Johnson.
AFTERNOON DELIGHT
251 East Liberty
True to its name, Afternoon Delight's
Reuben was a delight. The diner improved
on the Reuben concept by substituting
lightly grilled pumpernickel for more tra-
ditional rye bread. A thick one-inch layer
of sliced corned beef was the perfect serv-
ing, though it did leave the sandwich rath-
er soggy. Make sure to show up before 3
p.m., when Afternoon Delight closes!

ZINGERMAN'S
422 Detroit
The Zingerman's Reuben is not a great
sandwich. This is not to say that it isn't deli-
cious, because the ingredients are all of
very high quality. However, the sandwich
construction doesn't do the ingredients
justice. There was a clump of cheese that
overwhelmed the other ingredients, and
the bread overwhelmed the meat and sau-
erkraut near the crust, which was huge.
AMER'S
312 South State
The standard reuben at Amer's is listed
as number one on its long sandwich menu,
butdon't let that fool you. There's little sur-
prise between the slices of rye. The swiss
isn't quite fully melted and the meat tastes
entirely typical . It's heavy on the salt and
pepper and light on the Russian dressing.
Overall, a satisfying lunch? Mildly, but it's
no number one.

SINGLE REVIEW

TRAILER REVIEW

There was a moment in the
mid-'80s when independent
music seemed to be straddling
two lines -
moodier, more
texture-driven
groups like Wild g
Bauhaus and
Echo & the "Romance"
Bunnymen
staked their Merge
claim on one
side while all-out assault-rock-
ers like Hiisker DO and Dino-
saur Jr. shouted from the other.
Since the older days of post-
punk, it's almost like whenever
independent rock music seems
to run out of ideas, the response
is to either turn inward and
minimalist or to crank up the

volume.
Count the newly formed Wild
Flag as being firmly in the lat-
ter camp; composed of former
Sleater-Kinney grrris Carrie
Brownstein and Janet Weiss,
Helium's Mary Timony and
The Minders' Rebecca Cole, the
supergroup wants to make it its
mission to kick out the jams.
The leading single, penned
by Brownstein, is nothing if not
a call to arms for the laptop set
to shut off the loops and sam-
plers and to pick up a guitar.
You can almost picture Brown-
stein dishing out the rock kicks
without ahint of irony when she
growls, "Hey, hey / Can you feel
it?" at the track's opening like a
latter-day (and probably much

cooler) Joan Jett. Rocking out
for it's own sake - on record,
anyway - might seem more
disingenuous for a group with a
lesser pedigree; instead, Brown-
stein and co.'s reaffirming urge
to throw punches is nothing
if not refreshing. Brownstein
sums up the group's mantra -
and appeal - in a single line
in the track's rah-rah chorus:
"We've got an ear / An ear for
what's romance."
It's a rallying cry for those
whose ears have been craned
toward unabashed, get-
roughed-up rock long before
S-K's glory days and a wake-up
call for those who might have
fallen deaf since.

Love poems, not poets

Cacophony, or music? It all depends on your perspective.
Keep on Festi fa lin

How I learned to
stop hating and love
the extravaganza
By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Community Culture Editor
It took me three tries to work
up the courage to brave Fes-
tifall. Each time I neared the
Diag I veered off, stalking the
perimeter like a feral cat unused
* to such a dense population of
people. After pathetically and
shamefully hoping Festifall
would get canceled a second
time, I finally inched my way
toward the dreaded spectacle.
I was met with a cacophony of
*competing top-40 hits and stu-
dents-turned-salesmen trying
to lure me with buttons and the

cheap candy that inevitably ends
up languishing at the bottom of
my backpack.
I tried to think like a fresh-
faced freshman as opposed to
the jaded junior I've become
after years ofcasually signing up
for countless listservs, and then
accidentally hitting "Reply All"
in order to request to be taken
off. Sorry for the inadvertent
listserv public shaming, anony-
mous student group. I think you
guys are great.
But as soon as I got within
shouting distance of any of the
densely packed tables, I was
bombarded with manipulative
questions that I guess aren't
actually rhetorical. "Do you like
art?" someone chirped at me
when I accidentally made eye
contact. I was trapped behind a
herd of students, so I stuttered,

"Uh ... no," before shamefully
ducking my head and seeking
shelter in Angell Hall.
After collecting my thoughts
and doinga couple of improvised
deep breathing exercises, Isteeled
my nerves and promised myself to
actually try engaging with these
well-meaning students. After all,
I should be able to empathize
with my flyer-wielding peers - I
forewent my own duties to run a
beloved student group's booth in
order to write about the Festifall
experience.
I, too, have faced down the
apathetic student who gave me
a blank stare when I asked if he
liked social justice (he didn't,
and by one student I mean, like,
hundreds). I've watched with
dismay and eventually rage as
students graciously accepted my

umn for the past year, then you
know I think
it's easy to
love poetry.
But try lov-

check instead. It's not easy to
enjoy mundane reality with
someone whose energy is so
often committed to the imagina-
tion. Maybe that's why poets
tend to fall in love with other
poets: Only the misunderstood
understand the misunderstood.
Things often go badly when
poets love poets. No matter how
many times they read the warn-
ings of sad love poems, they still
fall in love with the people who
write sad love poems. They won't
listen. It's like trying to tell a
teenager that he might someday
regret having the lyrics to "Jimi
Thing" tattooed on his back.
Even if poets' relationships
with each other don't last, the
work they write about each other
can. We read those poems expect-

language, too. That's certainly

S / A 'JURASSIC PARK' (1993), UNIVERSAL
'Jurassic' not yet extinct

By ANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
At one point in Steven Spiel-
berg's original "Jurassic Park"
adaptation, when its dinosaurs-
reborn concept has already reared
its glorious Apatosaurus head,
Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum,
TV's "Law & Order: Criminal
Intent"), in his best wacky chaoti-
cian voice, provides the ultimate
caveat: "Life finds a way."
Eighteen years after the
film's release, "Jurassic Park"
is increasingly relevant, and its
themes are even more prevalent
today than ever before. The film
is often considered among Spiel-
berg's less cerebral efforts, given
its six-month release window
with the heavier "Schindler's
List." "Jurassic Park" has fallen
victim to flighty opinions, paying
more attention to the film's cul-
tural effect than its content.
People might remember
"Jurassic Park" for its chase
scenes, lush visuals and before-
its-time animatronic and CGI
dinosaurs, but what people
rarely mention about the block-
buster is its success in creating
an effecting ensemble of human
drama without much contem-
plative melodrama and a subtle
script approach, something sel-
dom seen in such a populist film.
While "Jurassic Park" may be
Spielberg's quintessential spe-
cial-effects film, it's also one of
the most affecting and cohesive
pictures of his career.
In the film, as in Michael
Crichton's original novel, Juras-
sic Park is an island off the coast
of Costa Rica morphed into a
dinosaur amusement park by the
genetic engineering company
InGen and its cheery Brit chief
John Hammond (Sir Richard
Attenborough, "Miracle on 34th
Street"). With recombined DNA
sourced from prehistoric fossil-
ized mosquitoes, the dinosaurs
of Jurassic Park are just about
the real thing - huge, majestic
and vicious - but are caged up in
pens like in a zoo.
In the case of Jurassic Park,
as Dr. Malcolm said, "Life finds
1a way." Once the electric system
on the park fails, there is little to
stop the assault by the dinosaurs,
which we soon find have been
breeding, despite genetic efforts
to prevent it. Needless to say, our
human protagonists are soon
overwhelmed by the creatures
and find themselves the prey of
their zoo animals.
"Jurassic Park" became a cul-
tural phenomenon and was, at

the time, the biggest worldwide awareness of our effect upon life

when an Apatosaurus tries to feed
on the foliage near some of the
characters' restingspot. Teenager
Lex (Ariana Richards) freaks out,
already disillusioned by the car-
nivorous Tyrannosaur encoun-
tered earlier. Her brother Tim
(Joseph Mazzello, "The Social
Network") reassures her, telling
her it's merely a "veggie-saurus."
Comforted, Lex feeds the gentle
giant, which then sneezes, cover-
ing her in dinosaur snot.
It's the classic lines and
moments - even moments of
dinosaur danger - that make
"Jurassic Park" a more human
movie than the common bland
disaster and creature flicks. See-
ing the lawyer Donald Gennaro
(Martin Ferrero, "Gods and
Monsters") sprint away from an
encroaching Tyrannosaur and
toward the bathroom, Dr. Mal-
colm says simply, "When you
gotta go, you gotta go." And when
Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck), park
game warden, realizes the blood-
thirsty velociraptors have out-
smarted and surrounded him, he
says, "clever girl."
More important, though (and
seldom recognized), is the film's
underlying theme. The humans'
attempt to control dinosaurs is
futile, as is InGen's expectation
to peacefully combine species
from across hundreds of millions
of years. Extrapolating the film to
the everyday, it's a call for human

DETROIT
From Page 1B
Beth Diamond, an associate
professor in the Schools of Art
& Design and Natural Resources
and the Environment, works with
the Heidelberg Project - a two-
block living multi-multi-multi-
media project in the blighted
Black Bottom district of Detroit
that bursts with found objects
from teddy bears to bicycles, as.
well as paint, posters and any-
thing at all that founder and
neighborhood resident Tyree
Guyton could imagine to be art.
As lead designer for the project's
Cultural Village, Diamond deals
with community involvement,
helping the Heidelberg sustain
and support its neighborhood.
Though this is Diamond's
first design venture in inner-city
Detroit, she has worked on simi-
lar projects in other locales, like
Los Angeles and the mountains of
Colorado.
"I would say if you were to track
my interest in general, it's been in
terms of digging deep into mostly
marginalized cultures," Diamond
said. "My approach is really to
collect as much information, as
many stories, to really read oral
histories, to talk to people, to be
'out there' - and then use tmyself

as a filter to get to some of the
goals that these groups might not
have thought about, or thought
were possible."
Where Newell sees an "avail-
able experimenting ground"
for her architecture projects in
Detroit, Diamond holds a dif-
ferent philosophy, stressing that
newcomer artists try to connect
to the local communities.
"Detroit is not just a play-
ground for people to come in
and to do something," she said.
"I think it's great for people to
come in and experiment in terms
of environmental possibilities
and building technologies, and
get off the grid, and make art, but
don't run over the people who are
already there. ... There's a lot of
healing that needs to happen."
Since joining the Heidelberg,
Diamond has seen the recent
upsurge of tourists and artists in
Detroit spark concerns of gentri-
fication on the part of longtime
residents. They worry the outside
visitors will stay in the city and
costs will rise.
"'We're not going to have
any place to live,' " Diamond
described the mindset.
While Diamond doesn't think
that could happen anytime soon,
she sees both fear of gentrifica-
tion and lack of it as all the more
reason to use art as a tool for

discuss Detroit authors, and she
brings in local writers to dis-
cuss their work and insights into
Detroit.
"That gives you a whole differ-
ent perspective on the city than
the facts and the figures and the
politics and the problems, and so
on and so forth," Hernandez said.
"You have to interact with the
city through its creative survivals
(in order to understand it)."
And when her students begin
to interact with Detroit on a cre-
ative level, what do they find?
According to Hernandez, an art

"Detroit has always, at least in
my memory, had a gritty side to it
that's inspired writers," she said.
"I always like to say that we're
always influenced by the auto
industry, too. ... There's a kind of

FESTIFALL

flyer and then turned around and
trashed it.
Right. In. Front. Of. Me.
Rude.
So I can sympathize with the
dancers, activists, Harry Potter
enthusiasts and the lame Uni-
versity-sponsored booths try-
ing to draw people in with their
S.W.A.G. in order to strengthen
their numbers, raise awareness
and so on. But Festifall has long
since lost its sheen, congesting the
Diag and its adjoining extremities,
its flyers littering the ground and
students trying to out-shout each
other. So I decided to find a real
freshman and try to recapture my
own excitement for Festifall.
Unfortunately, I don't know
any freshmen and I'm not espe-
cially adept at spotting them. So
I decided to track one down. I
sauntered up to booths, trying to
separate one of these vulnerable
minors from the herd. I awk-
wardly peered behind one young
man as I watched him scribble
down "first year" on a clipboard.
When I asked if he would like
to be interviewed by a member

of one of the best college news-
papers in the country, he gave
me the same wild-eyed, trapped
look that had been my default
face since I entered the fray that
is Festifall. "Uh, no thanks,"
he said before scudding away. I
guess I deserved that.
I enlisted a few friends I met
up with to help me find a fresh-
man eager to give his or her take
on Festifall and all of its bountiful
offerings. Are they intimidated?
Awe-struck by this exotic display?
Are they here to collect some free
stuff? Are they here to sign up
for as many clubs as possible and
find their niche in this vast world?
What are their motives?
Standing at the edge of the
Diag with a friend, I smiled - in
what I imagined was an inviting
way - at random people, tape
recorder in hand, ready to col-
lect hard data for my debut eth-
nographic work. People hurried
past us. We got frustrated. So
we took to politely asking (read:
shouting) at random groups
asking for freshmen. Shock-
ingly, this was not an effective
technique. Apparently, if you
innocently, inquire if someone
is a freshman this is taken as
an insult. One pair looked at my

helpless friend, dragged into my
research project because I emo-
tionally blackmailed her, and
sneered, "Uh no, we're alumni."
Touche. Turns out, no one will
actually admit to being a fresh-
man and if you imply that an
upperclassman is one (blasphe-
my!), he or she will try to make
you cry for your honest mistake.
And I realized this was my
problem. Beinga freshman implies
you're young, innocent and wide-
eyed. Instead of marveling at the
sheer vastness of opportunities
(and stickers ... so many stick-
ers!) the University of Michigan
student body has to offer, I grum-
bled about how inconvenient it is,
instead of remembering how won-
derful and mysterious the Univer-
sity used to be. I glowered at the
crowds like a townie trying to
navigate Fart Fair - I mean, Art
Fair. When I finally snapped out
of my prematurely cynical funk,
I realized Festifall is really a cool,
quirky thing.
The Quidditch team was
