Students made
up less than five
percent of vote
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor City Council
elections Tuesday brought few
surprises, as all incumbent candi-
dates held their seats and Demo-
cratic candidate John Eaton joined
the ten-member board.
Total voter turnout was
13.25-percent of registered voters
with a total of 22,888 ballots cast
across the 66 precincts.
The closest election was in the
second ward, with independent
incumbent Jane Ldmm holding
her seat over Democratic chal-
lenger Kirk Westphal. Lumm took
55.66 percent of the vote, Westphal
41.63 percent and Mixed Use Party
candidate Conrad Brown took 1.91
percent. The Ward 2 election also
had the highest voter turnout at

19.83 percent.
At 9:45 p.m., as Lumm led with
a 54-percent majority before the
absentee votes were counted, she
addressed a group of more than 50
supporters.
"We're a wonderful collection
of Democrats, Republicans, Inde-
pendents, Libertarians all com-
ing together because we share the
same concerns," Lumm said to the
room. "We care so much about this
community and that's what this
is all about. It was never about a
party. Talk about something ener-
gizing, motivating, exciting."
Councilmember Sumi Kailasap-
athy (D-Ward 1) attended Lumm's
watch party at the Paesano Ital-
ian restaurant near Arborland to
express her support. She noted
that she and Lumm share similar
priorities.
"We really want. to bring the
focus back to fiscal responsibility,
and providing core services like
fire and streets and garbage pick-
ups," she said. "Jane has been a

'U' to participate
in second annual
national competition
to win $10,000
By KRISTEN FEDOR
For The Daily
Throughout the fall, a group of
University students will compete in
the second-annual Up to Us cam-
paign- to educate their peers on
the long-term debt crisis in United
States.
'University students are compet-
ing against students from 24 other
schools to make campaigns about the
debt crisis and will be judged on cri-
.teria ranging from creativity to visible
impact on campus. The winning cam-
paign will win a $10,000 cash prize
and recognition from former Presi-
dent Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global
Initiative University in early 2014.
The group receives training
through weekly webinars sponsored
by Up to Us and will receive a $2,000
budget to help conceptualize and
execute its campaign in early 2014.
The University was chosen to partic-
ipate in lastyear's Up to Us campaign
as well, but the team from the Uni-
versity of Virginia won the $10,000
top prize.
The Clinton Global Initiative Uni-
versity was established as a.nation-
wide effort to get students involved
engaged in policy and political issues
with an eye on solutions. The CGI U

partnered with the Peter G. Peterson
Foundation and Net Impact to make
the "Up to Us" campaign a reality
last year.
LSA junior Benjamin Park, cam-
paign director for the University's
team, said it's especially important
for college-aged students to be aware
of the crisis because they're not often
involved in looking for a solution.
"Most of the policies that are
made are not made by anyone in our
age group, yet the policies of today
are going to be what affects our lives
in the future," Park said.
Though the core team is com-
posed of five people, Park is opti-
mistic about this year's campaign,
noting there is already an increase
in student participation compared to
last year's effort, with more than 50
people already involved.
Park said the 2012 campaign did
not have a significant enough impact
on the University's campus, and
this year's organizers are looking to
expand its influence.
While they are still in the plan-
ning stages, participants are looking
forward to creating a video for the
cause with the help of other student
groups, hoping to bring in a wider
audience. The coordinators also plan
on booking professors and bringing
in local politicians to speak to stu-
dents.
"We also want to have fun events
that all students can come to and that
they'll enjoy," LSA freshman Court-
ney Kim, the event design chair, said.
"While they're having fun, they can
get to know fiscal policies."

Innovative focus
on zoning didn't
convince voters
ByMATTHEWJACKONEN
DailyStaffReporter
After a poor turnout, the
Mixed Use Party is bent but
not yet broken.
Ann Arbor City Council
incumbents Jane Lumm (I-
Ward 2) and Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) defeated
both Mixed Use candidates,
LSA senior Conrad Brown

in Ward 2 and Sam DeVarti
in Ward 3.,Though DeVarti
garnered nearly 30 percent
of the vote in the third ward,
Brown failed to surpass a
two percent of the vote in the
three-person race in the sec-
ond ward.
So, what will come of the
Mixed Use Party, an effortby
college students to influence
the city's zoning laws?
University alum Will
Leaf, co-chair of the Mixed
Use Party, said he is not yet
done fighting for his party's
platform, but is unsure of the
party's future.

"We believe in our ideas,
and we knew it was going
to be difficult," Leaf said.
"We're going to continue
advocating for those ideas,
and we don't know what
form that is going to take
yet."
While working the polls
and attempting to coax more
residents into voting for
Mixed Use candidates, Leaf
noted that success for him
meant getting more than
three students out to vote. In
the last off-year city council
election, only three students

Former medical
center chief wins
with 55 percent
of ballots cast
DETROIT (AP) - A former
medical center chief defeated
a county sheriff to become the
next mayor of financially trou-
bled Detroit, though the job
holds little power while the city
is being run by a state-appoint-
ed emergency manager.
Unofficial returns showed
Mike Duggan defeating Wayne
County Sheriff Benny Napo-
leon 55 percent to 45 percent.
Napoleon conceded defeat late
Tuesday in a race where he was
outspent by Duggan by about
3-to-1 heading into Tuesday's
election.
Both candidates had said
during the campaign that the
state-appointed emergency
manager should leave the city

and allow the new mayor to
fix Detroit's finances when he
takes office in January.
"I'm going to try to shorten
Kevyn Orr's stay," Duggan told
The Associated Press heading
into the election.
But the reality is that Dug-
gan will have little power
under emergency manager
Kevyn Orr, who in Julyfiled to
take Detroit into bankruptcy.
Duggan, an ex-county pros-
ecutor and former chief of the
Detroit Medical Center, said he
wants to convince Orr's boss,
Gov. Rick Snyder, to allow him
to develop a team and a plan
to resuscitate the city's fiscal
condition if elected mayor.
Both Duggan and Napoleon
campaigned on fixing Detroit's
deteriorating neighborhoods
and reducing the high crime
rate in a city that struggles to
respond to 911 calls on time.
Detroit has more than 30,000
vacant houses and build-
ings. Bing's administration

has demolished about 10,000
empty and dangerous houses
during his four-year term.
But anything the new mayor
wants done that requires money
must first get Orr's approval.
Snyder did not endorse a
candidate, but after testimony
last week in bankruptcy court,
he held firm in his decision
to appoint Orr and keep him
in place until Detroit emerg-
es from bankruptcy and its
finances are fixed.
"Detroit's fiscal crisis was six
decades in the making," Snyder
said in a statement. "My job is
to make the tough decisions to
resolve the problems we face
today, not ignore them."
Detroit's mayor cannot
remove Orr. Under state law,
that only can be done by the
governor or an act of the state
legislature. However, once
Orr's 18-month contract ends a
supermajority vote by the city
council and mayor can choose
not to renew it.

Current Mayor Dave Bing
did not seek re-election. He
has always been opposed to
Detroit having an emergency
manager and has been frus-
trated by the relationship he
has with Orr, saying that Orr
hasn't communicated well
with the mayor's office.
Duggan becomes Detroit's
first white mayor since the
early 1970s. The city is more
than 80 percent black.Experts
say the data will improve
understanding about how
planets form, what conditions
might make life possible and
where else in the universe it
might exist.
The orbiter is expected to
have at least six months to
investigate the planet's land-
scape and atmosphere. At its
closest point, it will be 365
kilometers (227 miles) from
the planet's surface, and its
furthest point will be 80,000
kilometers (49,700 miles)
away.

McAuliffe defeats Cuccinelli in Va.

Gubernatorial
election lacks
voter enthusiasm,
turnout
TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP)
- Terry McAuliffe wrested the
governor's office from Repub-
licans on Tuesday, capping an
acrimonious campaign that
was driven by a crush of nega-
tive advertising, non-stop accu-
sations of dodgy dealings and a
tea party-backed nominee who
tested the limits of swing-vot-
ing Virginia.
McAuliffe received* 47 per-
cent to Cuccinelli's 46 percent,
with 97 precincts reporting.
McAuliffe, a Democrat,
ran strong among unmarried
women, voters who made abor-
tion a top issue and those who
called the suburbs of Wash-
ington, D.C., home, accord-

ing to preliminary results of
an exit poll conducted for The
Associated Press and the tele-
vision networks. Cuccinelli,
meanwhile, fared well among
tea party backers, gun own-
ers and among the state's rural
residents - but there were not
enough of them to yield a vic-
tory.
In winning, McAuliffe broke
a stubborn streak in state his-
tory. During the past nine gov-
ernor's races, the party that
controlled the White House at
the time has always lost.
That's not to say voters
rushed to back McAuliffe's
vision for Virginia. Turnout for
was low, and both candidates
worked through Election Day
to reach as many potential vot-
ers as possible.
Only 52 percent of voters
said they strongly backed their
candidate, the rest had reser-
vations or backed a candidate
because they disliked the other

options, according to exit polls.
Neither major candidate's ideo-
logical views seemed "right"
for a majority of Virginians, So
percent called Cuccinelli too
conservative, 41 percent said
McAuliffe is too liberal.
The exit poll included inter-
views with 2,376 voters from 40
polling places around the state.
The margin of error was plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
Voters' dissatisfaction
couldn't overshadow the
fight on television. McAuliffe
enjoyed a 10-to-1 advertising
advantage over Cuccinelli dur-
ing the final days.
"We were very heavily out-
spent but I'm proud we ran on
first principles," Cuccinelli told
supporters in conceding. "The
battle goes on."
The campaign's tilt turned
many voters off.
"I really hated the nega-
tive campaigning," said Ellen
Tolton, a 52-year-old grant

writer. "I didn't want to votefor
any of them."
Richard Powell, a 60-year-
old retired IT manager who
lives in Norfolk, described him-
self as an independent who fre-
quently votes for members of
both parties. He said he casthis
ballot for McAuliffe, although
not because he's particularly
enthusiastic about him. He said
he was more determined not
to vote for Cuccinelli, who he
said overreaches on a variety of
medical issues.
Voters were barraged with a
series of commercials that tied
Cuccinelli to restricting abor-
tions, and while Powell said
the negative advertising "got to
be sickening," abortion rights
played a factor in his vote.
"I'm not in favor of abortion
- let's put it that way - but I
find that restricting abortion
causes far more social harm
than allowing abortion, so that
was an issue for me," he said.

Health System's campaign work
and spearhead the overall effort
for student support.
In his position as vice chair,
Richard Rogelwill work with Ste-
phen Ross, the namesake of the
Business school and chair of the
campaign. The Victors for Michi-
gan campaign's diverse goals will
prioritize raising at least $1 bil-
lion for student support, funding
for basic and applied research,
finding new models of engaged
learning and addressing pressing
global issues.
"This University gave me so
much, and Susan and I want to
give back in ways that will make
a difference to students and
the Health System as a whole,"
Rogel said in a statement. "With
this gift, and my new role in the
upcoming campaign, we hope to
do our part to help all patients,
now and tomorrow, who will be
touched by the Health System's

care, discoveries and innovative
minds."
Susan Rogel has previously
worked on the Alumni Asso-
ciation's campaign committee
and the C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital's Leadership Team.
She is also a member of the
Victors for Michigan cam-
paign's steering committee.
The campaign's overall goal
will be announced at a press
conference Thursday.
The donation brings the Rog-
els' lifetime total gifts to the
University to nearly $76 mil-
lion. In 2000, the Rogels creat-
ed a $22-million scholarship for
out-of-state students, helping
support nearly 500 students'
tuition.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily last week, Rich-
ard Rogel said support scholar-
ships has grown tremendously
as compared to the past. He also
had an optimistic outlook for the
upcoming Victors for Michigan
campaign, which will be formally
rolled out at events on Thursday

and Friday.
"I just think this is going to be
very successful, and I just don't
see that much in the way of chal-
lenges," Rogel said. "I see the
need for the campaign as a chal-
lenge. We have a need to keep the
University of Michigan great -
and one of the major ways we're
going to do it is through this cam-
paign."
Richard Rogel served as chair
of the Michigan Difference fun-
draising campaign, which ran
from 2004 through 2008. The
Michigan Difference raised
more than $3.2 billion for the
University - a record among
public school campaigns. The
total included 1,969 scholarships
and $519 million for student sup-
port.
"When you bring out the stu-
dents and show how, number one,
how important the scholarships
are, and number two, how bright
and energetic the students are,
it's a very easy sell," Rogel said
last week.
Ora Pescovitz, the University's

executive vice president for.rted-
ical affairs, said in a statement
that the gift will help the Medi-
cal School transform medicine
in clinical care, education and
medical discovery..
The gift to the Chinese Stud-
ies program will help expand
the center's offerings in history,
literature, politics and econom-
ics, among other areas of study,
according to Interim LSA Dean
Susan Gelman. It will also allow
the program to partner with peer
academics in China to enhance
the program's collaboration
opportunities for faculty and stu-
dents.
The Rogels' donation is the
latest leadership gift in the run-
up to the Victors for Michigan
launch.
In September, Stephen Ross
donated $200 million - the Uni-
versity's largest gift ever - to
benefit his namesake schoql and
the University's Athletic Depart-
ment. In April, the University
received a $110-million donation
from Charles Munger, the vice

chairman of Berkshire Hatha-
way, to build a graduate-student
residence hall at Division and
Madison streets.
The Zell Family Foundation
granted $50 million in March to
the LSA Master of Fine Arts in
Creative Writing program - the
largest in the college's history -
to provide resources for the pro-
gram toease the financial burden
for its students.
Additionally, the Frankel fam-
ily gave a total of $50 million to
the University's Cardiovascu-
lar Center - with $25 million in
2007 and another $25 million in
March.
On Friday, the University's
fundraising campaign kick-off
will start with a Community Fes-
tival from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. in
Ingalls Mall, the main event in
Hill Auditorium from 8 p.m. to 9
p.m. and an after-party until 10
p.m.

wants to bring focus back to the
neighborhoods."
Westphal conceded the elec-
tion shortly before 9 p.m., trail-
ing in all but one precinct.
In an interview at the event,
Westphal lauded his support-
ers for their efforts during the
campaign.
"I knew I was coming into
this with much less name rec-
ognition than the incumbent,"
Westphal said. "We ran a very
efficient campaign with lots of
help. We got far outspent but
we pulled a good showing and
I'm really proud of all the sup-
port we got."
Democratic incumbent Ste-
phen Kunselman won Ward 3
with 70.42 percent of the vote
while Mixed Use challenger
SamDeVarti took 28.17percent.
Kunselman will also be run-
ning in the mayoral race next
year but said he still looks to
focus on public safety and pub-
lic health while on the council.
DeVarti said his loss was
likely due to miscalculations in
campaign strategy, noting the
difficulty of running as an inde-
pendent.
"I feel like there are some
things I could have done bet-
ter," DeVarti said. "There are
some key places I missed, pri-
marily Stephen Kunselman ter-
ritory where I think he's going
to have a much, much stron-
ger showing where I think I
could've influenced voters."
Kunselman and DeVarti
shared Dominick's for their
watch parties - the two can-
didates have been long-time
family friends. Kunselman's
wife, Letitia Kunselman, said
the DeVarti family has helped
Kunselman in many of his elec-
tions prior to this year and Ste-
phen Kunselman said he has
been supportive of the Mixed
Use Party.

"It's encouraging knowing
that the youth are willing to put
the effortintoparticipatinginthe
democracy,"Kunselman said.
Conrad Brown didn't gener-
ate nearly as much support for
the Mixed Use Party in Ward
2's highly competitive election,
taking only 1.91 percent.
In Ward 1, Democratic
incumbent Sabra Briere beat
challenger independent chal-
lenger Jeff Hayner with 66.30
percent of the vote. Eaton in
Ward 4 and Democrat Mike
Anglin in Ward 5 had only
write-ins to beat, with Eaton
securing 88.92 percent in his
ward and Anglin taking 67.78
percent.
Of the predominantly stu-
dent-resident precincts, 1,214
votes were cast, making up
approximately 5 percent of the
votes cast. In some of this data,
student, and non-student pre-
cincts are combined.
Students at the polls were
eager to get involved in Ann
Arbor politics, some voting for
the first time and others hoping
to impact change in the city.
"Since I'm now 18 and legally
able to vote, I wanted to start
contributing to my demo-
cratic society," LSA freshman
Christopher Seeman said. "I
didn't vote just for the sake of
it. I want to keep looking into
understanding politics of Ann
Arbor more."
LSA sophomore Marissa
Allegrasaid it was importantfor
students to vote in Ann Arbor
elections because of the effect
the student vote can have.
"There've been alot of things
that have happened in the last
year legally that a lot of stu-
dents are concerned about,"
Allegra said. "It's just good to
be involved in your environ-
ment whether you're on or off
campus.".

tion stated. "The mere presence
of a candidate ina Campus Com-
puting Site does not constitute a
violation of this rule."
A subsequent subsection sim-
ilarly made the rule applicable
to University libraries.
LSA sophomore Nicholas
Rinehart, author of the resolu-
tion, said through the amend-
ments to the election code, he
hoped to see less aggressive
campaigning in study loca-
tions.
"It's a harmful process for
us because not everyone likes
CSG," Rinehart said. "I think
we come off as terribly annoy-
ing and we don't really have any
incentive to make people want
to vote for us."
During the last election cycle,
LSA seniors Chris Osborn and
Hayley Sakwa, then the presi-
dential and vice presidential

candidates from the political
party forUM, were disquali-
fied from the presidency after
Osborn was found to have
actively influened students
while voting in University facil-
ities. The duo had won a plural-
ity of the vote.
After the polls had closed,
photographs of Osborn stand-
ing behind students in the Law
Library and Angell Hall com-
puting center were circulated in
what appeared to be incidents of
his influencing students while
voting. Ambiguities surround-
ing whether Osborn's presence
constituted a violation of the
compiled code were settled with
hearings in front of the Univer-
sity Election Commission, the
judicial body presiding over
CSG elections. Representatives
hoped the resolution would stop
those activities.
Members present at the
assembly also voiced their con-
cerns over the potential impact
of the resolution on the greater
election process. Law student

John Lin said he believed that
banning campaign-related con-
versation in largely populated
University facilities could be an
impediment to the election out-
comes.
About 10,000 students voted
in the March presidential and
vice presidential elections - 24
percent of the total University
student population.
As a result, Lin moved the
assembly to remove the clause
that prohibited campaigning
from University Libraries, but
keep the clause that restrict-
ed campaigns on Computing
Sites. The amendment passed
by a majority in the assembly,
only to be later overturned by
another amendment that would
only restrict campaigning in the
facilities during the 48-hour
election period.
Amid further debate sur-
rounding whether other
"gray-area" actions constitut-
ed campaigning, the legisla-
tion of election reform failed
to pass.

in the Markley and Hill neighbor-
hood voted, he said.
"I think anything that's an
improvement over two years ago
is good," Leaf said. "Two years
ago student turnout was close to
zero."
Leaf said the party built steam
earlier in the year while they were
recruiting students, especially
among freshmen. He noted that
the party had hundreds of people
at its mass meeting, but failed to
retain prospective members. Stu-
dents paid less attention to the
party and its goals, and only a
small amount - roughly 80 stu-
dents - returned.
He said the Mixed Use Party
registered anywhere between 300
and 400 students to vote.
DeVarti, the Mixed Use Par-
ty's candidate in Ward 3, said
his campaign was not wholly

geared toward students and he
did a lot'of campaigning in non-
student areas. However, he still
maintained that his campaign,
as well as the party as a whole,
placed emphasis on student vot-
ers.
Both Leaf and DeVarti said
the Mixed Use Party's platform
is founded on seemingly radical
ideas that can still bring positive
change to the city of Ann Arbor.
Leaf specifically noted that gain-
ing the support of city officials
alreadyon committees and boards
could really bring about realistic
change.
"The planning commission
came-up to me and told me that
we had a good ' idea," Leaf said.
"Maybe that's how some of the
ideas can be incorporated into
reality."
Leaf also said he and his party
are waiting for a counterargument
to their mixed-use zoning solu-,
tions. On that level of debate, Leaf
said the party is sound.

"We haven't heard a counterar-
gument yet," Leaf said.
DeVarti, also maintained that
his goal was to build enough of a
foundation for the continuation of
the Mixed Use Party.
"My goal ultimately was to get
a good enough showing flying
the Mixed Use Party flag where
I could ensure a future for the
Mixed Use Party," DeVarti said.
"Goal number one, realistically,
was to make sure the party has a
future."
The future of the party isn't
clear. Leaf said he hopes for
its continuation, but is unsure
how to make winning a real-
ity.
But there's still hope, and DeV-
arti said he believes Leaf is key to
a successful future for the Mixed
Use platform.
"The conventional wisdom is
that students don't vote," DeVarti
said. "And if there's anyone that
can break from the conventional
wisdom, it's Will (Leaf)."

"We are protesting our civil

Kepyour head- in the game
Neurologists sholtId be on st iiWby for all NCAA football games
s more studies reveal the devastating effects of concussions, the
pressure on football teams to provide effective healthcare for
head injuries has increased significantly. With the University
football team facing off against Michigan State University this past week-
end, The New York Times highlighted the efforts of both schools' extra
safety precautions for its players. Unlike (ather Big 10 conference schools,
both schools have neurologists on the sidelines for both home and away

that occur during football games, both universities deserve praise for

The rise of the non-apology

pened, so take accountability for your
behavior and apologize for your role
in making someone feel offended,
angry, marginalized, etc.
Apologizefor whatyou did - notfor
getting caught. Saying something like
"I'm sorry I said this - it was insen-
sitive to our diverse staff members,"
implies that what you did was wrong
not because it was actually wrong,
but because the person you wronged
was there to witness it. This sort of
apology suggests that in a different
context, where said person wasn't
there or said "diverse" identities
were absent, your words and behav-
ior would have been OK. This is not
an apology. This is you saying you're
sorry you got caught and will try
harder to get away with it next time
- perhaps by being more "politically
correct" or making sure that some of
the comments you make are "off the
radar."
Apologize to all those affected
explicitly or indirectly. If your mis-
take affected certain individuals spe-

ing in your intentions. An apology
should be able to stand on its own
without prefaces, explanations, or
qualifiers. One common way apolo-
gies are spoiled into non-apologies is
through justifying your mistakes by
pointingto your non-malicious inten-
tions. It's OK to give some motiva-
tional context to your mistake, saying
somethinglike, "I meant tobe funny,
but I clearly failed and hurt you. I
apologize for my poor judgment,"
but explaining your motivations
should in no way attempt to change
how your comments or behavior are
interpreted by others. It doesn't mat-
ter if you had good or bad intentions
- the impact you caused remains the
same, and that's ultimately whatyou
have to answer to.
Don't suggest your mistake is sim-
ply the result of a slip in word choice
or poor framing. Non-apologizers
will often try to lessen the weight of
their mistake by framing it asa mere
problem of diction, saying things
like, "I need to be much more tact-

The University's decision to have a neurolo-
gist ot tthe sidelines shows its commitment to
player s .ety. Accord ing to the NCA A, "Dur.

Given the number of concussions being so

high and the constant risk of their occur-
rence, there's clearly a demonstrated need for
lead-injury-specialized health professionals,
and having a neurologist on the sideline is a
an investment in student-athlete health.
However, this policy shouldn't just be the
e'eeption within college football. The NFL
has a protocol that requires teams to have
neurologists on the sidelines, according to a
video from ESPN about concussions in col-
lege football. It's time for the NCAA to adopt
a similar policy.
The University has taken the lead to ensure
effeetive player safety. Kutcher has been a
necessary addition to the sidelines and is an
<s'et to the team. While other universities
tay te hesitant to institute a similar policy
because of the cost or what a doctor may
uncover, these schools - and the NCAA -
mttust recognize the importance of protecting
against head injuries and work to implement
the samte policy regardless of the financials.

whom I asked
to hold the elevator but said "sorry"
and allowed it to close anyway even
though there was plenty of time to
intervene. Other non-apologies have
much more serious implications,
like the complete lack of account-
ability for a government shutdown
that, among many things, halted
thousands of children from going to
preschool because of cuts in Head
Start and kept tens of thousands of
low-income mothers from feeding
their babies due to the slashing of
wIC budgets. And finally, fresh and
familiar on our own campus, the
highly embarrassing "response"
from Theta Xi for organizing a rac-
ist frat party is a classic example of
a sorry-I'm-not-sorry non-apology.
Why is it so difficult for us to apol-
ogize - and mean it? Apologizing is
tough. Our egos often get in the way
and make the worst of us. Some of us
may truly feel remorseful for some-
thing we said or did, but don't know
howto properlyexpress it. Onthe flip
side, some of us may verbally admit
our mistake but not really show that
we care to rectify it. The good news
about non-apologies is that we can
unlearn them - with practice, we
can cultivate a culture that cherish-
es sincere apologies. Here are some
ways to examine how we apologize:
Apologize for what you did-notfor
how others feel. Never under any cir-
cumstance apologize for someone's
emotions by making some terribly
trite comment like, "I'm sorry you
feel angryby this" or the typical "I'm
sorry you feel offended." These state-
ments expel you from the picture and
suggest that the person's emotions
exist in a vacuum, unrelated to your
words or actions. If you're offer-
ing any sort of apology, it's because
you had some role in whatever hap-

cifically but also
others more gen-
erally, you should
issue both a pri-
vate and a public
apology that align
in what they say.
Thatis, if you issue

ogy, follow it with

For many LARAMIE
Michiganders,
the coming of
fall also marks the beginning of
a long-standing tradition passed
down through family and friends:
hunting season.
I grew up in a family of hunters. I
spent my childhood waking up and
wondering if my dad had bagged
the big buck that morning. I used
to wait on the front porch to see if I
could catch a glimpse of that bright
hunters' orange coming down the
lane behind toy house. If Dad got a
deer, that meant venison, and veni-
son meant burgers, sausage, tender-
loin and liver - the whole works
for the entire winter. No more beef
from the grocery store for us.
However, hunting can be a con-
troversial subject, particularly in
Michigan. Recently, pro-hunting
groups have been facing off against
animal rights organizations over
the law passed by Michigan's leg-
islature naming wolves as a game
species - opening the door for a
possible wolf hunt in the Upper
Peninsula. Animal rights organiza-
tions, such as The Humane Soci-
ety of the United States and Keep
Michigan Wolves Protected have
rallied in an attempt to stop a Mich-
igan wolf hunt - one that will begin
with the rest of the hunting season
on Nov. 15 - eliciting the attention
of hunting advocates determined

to assert their rights as hu
trappers.
I recently read several

clear message being sent to Michi-
ganders: Pick a side - either you're
pro-hunting rights or against them.
But such a division between pro-
and anti-hunting proponents is not
so clean cut. Standing in opposition
to a seasonal Michigan wolf hunt
doesn't indicate an opposition to all
hunting, nor does it mean that anti-
wolf hunting campaigns are geared
towards the destruction of hunters'
rights.
I learned as a kid that respecting
the animal is the most important
thing you can do as a hunter. You
never take a shot unless it's a clean
kill, and you never let anything go
to waste - never should you kill for
simple pleasure and never should a
life be taken without purpose.
But wolf hunting is a practice
done for little more than trophies

ists out there
because hunters, for the most part,
spend a good deal of time actually
interacting with the natural world.
So why has the issue become so
polarized? Why are those against
the wolf hunt seen as so radically
"environmental" to pro-hunting
groups, and why, in many cases,
are hunters seen as cruel killers to
those who have never been exposed
to hunting? These questions are
important to answer as we, as a
state, strive to lay down a legacy
of conservation while at the same
time carrying on a long hunting tra-
dition. It's important to remember
that there are not only two sides of 0
this debate, but a large gray area in
between - I myself can testify.

Watching TV through a
permanent feminist lens

Creative 'Demise'

love television. When I
was 6, I snuck into my
parents' room to watch
"The X-Files" through the gap
between my index and middle
fingers.
When I was --
10, my fam-
ily moved to
a new house
** big enough
for my sis-
ter and I to
have our KAYLA
own rooms,
but the first UPADHYAYA
change I
noticed was
that we now had cable. When
I was 12, I started with "Lost,"
the first show that I would
watch from its airdate until the
day of its finale. When I was 17,
I live-tweeted an episode of TV
for the first time (it was "Glee,"
which I steadfastly followed
until I was 20). At 21, I decided,
with as much certainty as a
21-year-old can summon, I
don't want to go to Washing-
ton, D.C. after graduation like
most of my public policy peers,
but to L.A. to fight for a seat in
a writers' room.
I love television, but I also
hate it, and not only because
I've invested far too much
time and emotional energy on
fictional people. My love-hate
relationship with television
stems from the ongoing battle
between my identities as both a
TV lover and a feminist.
When I told a friend that
"The Mindy Project" makes me
uncomfortable, she prodded.
"I thought you loved Mindy
Kaling," she said.
I do. But my love for Kaling
can't trump the show's
oft-problematic storylines
(including an episode in which
guest star James Franco's
character Dr. L is raped, yet
none of the other characters
call it that) and racist, sexist
jokes. I told my friend all this
and more, breathless by the end
of my crescendoing soliloquy.
She blinked.
"Can't you just enjoy the
show? It's funny. Do you have
to always be in Critic Mode?"
It wasn't the first time I'd
heard something along these
lines. I've been called "too
sensitive," "too harsh," even
"too feminist" and all the
other usual epithets hurled at
most feminist critics I know.
Multiple people have asked me
if I'm ever going to write a TV
column that doesn't make some
mention of race or gender. Well,
no. I sincerely doubt it.
I have a professor who often
talks about the burden of
consciousness. "Consciousness
is a curse," she tells us.
Being a feminist requires
a constant vigilance that's
exhausting. Sometimes I
wish I could just walk away
after hearing a sexist or racist
remark, and there are times
when I do. But when I don't
engage, I end up thinking
about it for the rest of the day,
sometimes longer, frustrated
with my own inaction, wishing
I could just close my eyes and
blindly go on.
Consciousness is a curse,

and I can't ever escape it,
even when I'm watching TV.
Just enjoying a show isn't a*
concept I can wrap my head
around. Recently, the struggle

Basement Arts'
latest production full
of wit and humor
By GILLIAN JAKAB
For the Daily
Milena Westarb's play "The
Loving Demise of Lord Blackwell
and His Wife" got its first taste
of life at "Play-
fest" 2013, an The Loving
annual festivalD .i

course. The at 7 p.m.
script, plucked
from Westarb's Basement Arts
work in MT&D Free
Professor Oya-
mO's playwrit-
ing course, was workshopped and
set into motion last March as a
staged reading.
If the title of the play sounds
- familiar, you may be remember-
ing the buzz it generated during
Playfest last spring. Not'only did
the audience rave about it, but
the show also won the Dennis
McIntyre Prize for Distinction in
Undergraduate Playwriting in the
University's Hopwood Awards.
This year, Westarb, an LSA
junior and chemistry major who
pursues her literary passion
through a minor in writing, pro-
posed her play to Basement Arts,
one of the oldest student-run the-
ater groups on campus. Matching
her with Director Ellen Sachs,

Basement Arts has provided the
platform for "Loving Demise" to
rise toa full production.
Set in Victorian England, the
play tells the story of James Sol-
omon and his inheritance of a
large fortune upon the death of
his uncle, Lord Blackwell. Lady
Blackwell, the young, gold-dig-
ging widow, schemes desperately
to secure the wealth for herself.
With all the elements of drawing
room farce, "Loving Demise" is
a silly tale propelled by wit and
slapstick that is placed against
highly proper conduct and expec-
tations of the era.
"One of the things that's really
great about this show is that we
have this very serious facade -
this very serious outer level of
what Victorian England should
be, sound, act 'and look like ...
there's a lot of very intense for-
malities," Sachs said. "But from
those formalities we're able to
grow and find the jokes. There's
always something right under-
neath the surface bubbling and
that's where the humor comes
from."
Westarb's script calls for
numerous sets and locales. These
were easily created at "Playfest"'s
staged reading through that most
expedient of all production devic-
es: the imagination. But as full-
on theater, the script challenges
Basement Arts' abbreviated pro-
duction period and tight budget.
The solution: adaptation.
"The thing about this show,
more so than any other show
that I've worked on, has been the
beauty of adaptation and how
great it can be to adapt - how
exciting and fun it is. Because
from these adaptations we're
finding so many jokes and ways
of telling the story that we hadn't
originally anticipated," Sachs
said. "We've retained every sin-

gle character, every single story
line, every single plotline. It's
still there, but what we've done
is we've sort of economized the
locations."
Basement Arts' production
process has been a collaborative
one in every sense. Actors have
been the chief source of ideas for
physical comedy and they work
off each other's creativity. Com-
ing from varied backgrounds and
levels of experience - a mix of
musical theater, drama, LSA and
the Residential College students
- they each bring something
fresh and fun to the rehearsal
atmosphere. As inventive as
the actors have been in finding
moments where they can layer
the scenes and highlight absur-
dity, they ground their humorous
choices in historical accuracy and
depth.
"Everyone in the cast has
been a dramaturge. Everybody
has been doing historical and
social research and bringing
that to the table," Sachs said.
"That's just adding to the pro-
duction and rmaking it so much
more rich."
A lot of ingredients, locally
sourced in just the right propor-
tions, have gone into the Base-
ment Arts' production of "The
Loving Demise of Lord Blackwell
and His Wife." Sachs divulges
the key to the recipe: "the per-
feet balance of keeping the stakes
high, but not having them weigh
down on the characters, and
the production, to the point of it
becoming melodrama."
A text filled with rich and
descriptive language, a cast bub-
bling with personal flair and
innovative direction will bring
to life Victorian England, with
mannerly exteriors giving way
to lighthearted jest and drunken
tomfoolery.

Complicated 'Avril'
is all over the place

Would you like a
side of Lavigne with
your 'Lavigne'?
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
Lavigne was thirsty for an
intoxicatingly wild record to
follow up the relatively sincere
Goodbye Lul-
laby - eager
to free the
untamed pop- Avril Lavigne
rock artist
that became Avril Lavigne
an icon for
every compli- Epic
cated sk8r boi.
Evidently, the
visual production team missed
that memo. Lavigne's fun-filled
thrill ride of a fifth studio album
introduces itself as a cheerless
mascara advertisement, complete
with snow-white skin, a despon-
dent face, raccoon eyes and a
black backdrop. Not exactly the
look of a "Bitchin' Summer." It's
not for nothing that the expres-
sion "don't judge an album by its
cover" exists.
What intends to be an assem-

blage of defiant party anthems is
actually an assortment of absurd
contradictions. Lavigne can't
seriously expect the album's pre-
miere track, "Rock N Roll," to
justifiably introduce a collection
of sugar-coated pop productions
that narrate the intensity of being
a teenage girl in 2013 America.
This senselessness rivals the later
track "Bad Girl" - a hard rock
duet with Marilyn Manson -
being followed by "Hello Kitty,"
the obligatory 2013-dubstep mess
created for the sole purpose of
attempting to follow a trend.
The album isn't doing Lavigne
any favors by relentlessly drilling
the topic of age into the tracks (
"Here's To Never Growing Up"
and "17"). The 29 year old is
pleasantly youthful, in a worldly
sense. In a pop-rock sense, her
age is viewed as the beginning
of the end, despite how irratio-
nal or unfair that may seem, and
waging a lyrical war against age
is a messy battle, especially when
the attempt is as unsubtle asAvril
Lavigne's content.
Two blatantly obvious pitfalls
are the album's lead writer Chad
Kroeger (lead singer of the infa-
mous rock group, Nickelback) and

producer Martin Johnson (lead
singer of Boys Like Girls, whose
production credits lie somewhere
between producing for Hannah
Montana and producing for Vic-
toria Justice).
Stylistically, the album is any-
where and everywhere. Lavigne
took the palette and smashed
the whole thing all over the can-
vas. The Kroeger-written tracks
like "Let Me Go" and "Give You
What You Like") sound as if they
migrated to Lavigne from some
unreleased Nickelback album,
while the Johnson-produced
tracks (e.g. "Here's To Never
Growing Up") are a style junc-
tion between Cher Lloyd and One
Direction. Even the traditional
Avril Lavigne-style songs like
"Rock N Roll" have a rebellious-
ness that's campy to the point of
self-parody.
Avril Lavigne's form stains
its substance. Everything from
cover art to production style and
lyrical content is off the mark.
For another artist or album, per-
haps, the record's characteristics
would be fitting, but the frame
doesn't hold Lavigne or the atti-
tude she was striving for. Ironic,
given the self-titling.

"Masturbation feels like pizza tastes."
'Code' strikes a balance .

By CHLOE GILKE
Daily Arts Writer
Turn on MTV, and what will
you find? These days, it's less like-

and more like-

ly to be real-
ity television.
And if you
tuned in last
Wednesday
at 10:00 p.m.,
you would've
found what is

MTV

oversaturated videos of teens par-
tying, techno music and a sassy
female voice-over commanding,
"Listen up, ladies! It's 'Girl Code.'
For those of you who aren't
teenage girls, "Girl Code" is a
show on MTV that features a
bunch of young, up-and-coming
comedians commenting on topics
relevant to college-age life. The
premise is simple: Each 20-min-
ute installment comprises several
interviews with cast members
revolving around the episode's
four designated topics. Each only
gets discussed for about five min-
utes, so the cast members (five
guys and 14 girls) must exprees
their own opinions in the brief-
est, most creative way possible.
The result is a breeding ground
for one-liners and zingers that are
perfectly suited to being quoted
on Twitter or turned into .gifs on
Tumblr. The season two premiere

tackles virginity, popping zits,
slutty Halloween costumes and
bad boys.
And how do
you feel about
losing your
Ivirginity?
The episode opens with a
discussion on virginity. Issues
relating to sex and sexuality
can get tricky for a show like
this, which is trying to strike
the right balance between genu-
ine advice and its own brand of
snarky, "relatable" humor. The
lighthearted nature of this show
does not allow for a real forum
for discussion on virginity and
what it means, but it does allow
for a few good one-liners. Jes-
simae Peluso starts the conver-
sation by laughing the prompt
off and ,claiming, "I don't know
what virginity is anymore. It's
been a while ... " Alice Wetter-
lund echoes not long after, "I
think losing your virginity is a
personal choice. And personally
I chose to drop mine like a hot
potato with a spider on it."
The next five minutes is an
avalanche of embarrassing sto-
ries and sarcastic asides about
virginity during which each girl
emphasizes that it's important
to make sure that any decision
you make regarding virginity
is yours and yours alone. Jamie
Lee provides the final summa-
ry of the girl code to virginity:
"Lose it when you're ready. Not
when your boyfriend's ready, not
when your friends are ready, not
when some R. Kelly song comes

on and it puts you in the mood.
Lose it when you're ready."
The particular type of wom-
en-specific "relatable humor"
associated with the "Girl Code"
brand (see also: YouTube celeb-
rity Jenna Marbles or the Fat
Amy parody Twitter account,
@RelatableQuote) comes with a
lot of hurdles to jump. Jokes can
come off as bland or predictable
because they're so deeply rooted
in what is familiar to everyone.
To fight against the predictabil-
ity, cast members sometimes
rely on the shock factor of say-
ing vulgar things, but this only
works sparingly.
Many obstacles, however,
make "Girl Code" the perfect
training ground for its young
comedy stars. Being on the
show is a valuable opportunity'
for them to hone their creative
talents and learn how to work
around obstacles: It's com-
mon knowledge that females
are underrepresented in main-
stream comedy and the exis-
tence of"GirlCode" as aplatform
for up-and-comers to get regu-
lar exposure to the industry is a
huge step in the right direction.
The show itself may not be the
most sophisticated, but it serves
the important purpose of sup-
porting female comedians.
The show's one unwritten
rule is simple: "Girl Code" does
not judge. Though they may
sometimes be crass, "Girl Code"
cast members will never slut
shame or look down upon any
fellow female. Instead, they take
the approach of empowerment:
Make every choice your own
choice and own it. Despite their
"freedom of choice" mentality,
the segment on virginity has no
mention of those who choose to
wait until marriage. This is a
loud reminder that "Girl Code"
is a source of entertainment, not
a medium for discourse about
pertinent issues. Ina serious dis-
cussion it would be an important
point of view to hear, but when
the priority is cracking jokes,
waiting for marriage isn't really
good material to play off of.
"Girl Code" 's niche audience
of liberal, college-aged females
is definitely small and doesn't
have much potential for growth,
but it doesn't need to be huge
to be worth airing. It succeeds
at the difficult task of start-
ing a dialogue about even the
most graphic struggles of being
a young adult woman in today's
world in a truly funny way. On
its surface, "Girl Code" is 20
minutes of quotable entertain-
ment, but its subtler messages
and the opportunities it pro-
vides its cast members make it
much more valuable than it may
seem.

rnone, tra sl
n has een pitc

Throughout high school, the
phone would constantly ring in,
Michigan redshirt junior mid-
fielder Tyler Arnone's Hicks-
ville, N.Y. home. His mother,
Linda Rogus, would answer, the
voice on the other line asking if
Tyler could come to a local try-
out. Rogus would respectfully
decline, like she always did, cit-
ing that Tyler only played for fun.
She would hang up, shaking her
head.
"Who was that?" Arnone
would call to his mother from
another room.
"Your jazz band teacher,"
she'd yell. "He wants you to audi-
tion for a spot."
"Again?" Arnone would shout
back, feigning disbelief. He was
good at the trumpet, and he
knew it. He was second chair in
his school band despite never
practicing. His mother would
repeatedly tell him to pick up his
instrument, but he was so natu-
rally gifted, he rarely had to.
Arnone understands music
well - the nuances of it, the
harmonies that sound best, the
intricacies that distinguish good
from great. He has an enormous
appreciation for all types of
music, much like his value for all
aspects of soccer, from the beau-
tiful, fluid buildup to the rough,
choppy finishes.
A team captain this season,
Arnone is both the conduc-
tor and soloist on the field. He
holds together the team the way
a melody does a song. Connect-
ing passes and swinging the ball
from side to side, he keeps the
offense in sync. He plays with an
untamed passion which reflects
much of where he came from.
He grew up playing street soccer
where the old playground adage,
"no blood, no foul," dominated
games.
Hicksville is a quiet blue-collar
town on Long Island, the type of
place where thick family ties and
old-fashioned values run deep,
where simplicity reigns supreme.

Despite Hicksville's minute,
6.8-square-mile size, its musical
contributions include guitarists
Denny Dias of Steely Dan and
Al Pitrelli of Megadeath and the
Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
In the locker room two hours
before a recent match, Arnone
blasted his hometown's most
famous native son, Billy Joel.
"I love 'River of Dreams,' "
Arnone says. "He talks about
Hicksville alot."
Arnone grew up next door
to Joel and admired more than
just his music. Arnone, whose
father is a physical education
teacher and mother a gymnas-
tics coach, didn't come from for-
tunate means. After his parents
divorced, they worked hard to
support him and his older sis-
ter, and when times got tough
financially, Arnone would read
articles on Joel and try to com-
pare his mentality to that of his
music idol.
"(Joel) made the best of a not-
so-good area," Arnone said. "So.
why couldn't I?"
Arnone began playing soccer
at 4 years old, and it's been an
everyday thing since. He didn't
score a goal during his first two
years competing, but on his sixth
birthday, with his team losing
5-0, Arnone finally recorded his
first career tally - six of them,
leading his team to a 6-5 win.
"I remember it vividly,"
Arnone said. He pauses, laughs.
"My mom has it on video."
Arnone relied heavily on his
mother during his early child-
hood, and he considers her his
greatest influence. After his par-
ents split, she drove him to prac-
tice, made sure he kept on the
right path, picked him up when
he was down and attended all his
matches.
Since the time Arnone first
began playing, his father, while
local, has seen his son compete
in fewer than five games. Arnone
keeps in contact with his father
often, but the disappointment
of not having his support on the
field forced Arnone to fill that
void elsewhere.

"(My father) talks to me on
the phone, he's always there,"
Arnone said. "But because my
parents divorced, it's not that I
sought a father figure, but (my
coaches) kind of took that place
for me."
The Wolverines coaches this
season have been using the
phrase, "Entitled to nothing,
grateful for everything" around
their players, a motto Arnone
has taken to heart. There are
nights when Arnone will lie on
his bed and look around his room
- which is littered in Michigan
apparel - in awe, and count the
opportunities afforded to him.
"(I wasn't) poor, but lower-
middle class for sure," Arnone
says. "So then to come to a place

play Division I soccer."
It's the end-of-the-year play-
ers-and-coaches meetings in
2010, and the St. John's staff
is blunt with Arnone, who had
redshirted his freshman season
despite being healthy and will-
ing to play. Arnone - who had
passed on Michigan to stay clos-
er to-family - was watching his
college soccer career evaporate
before it ever started.
Arnone decided to transfer
and put Michigan on his schol-
arship release papers. The Wol-
verines former coaching staff,
led by former coach Steve Burns,
reached out to him the next day.
"They said, 'We want to make
this happen. How can we make
this happen?' "Arnone recalled.

has tallied 29 points on nine
goals and 11 assists in two-plus
seasons, earning 2012 first-team
All-BigTenhonors alongtheway.
How Arnone plays the game
separates him from other good
center midfielders. He's willing
to do the dirty things - to track
back defensively, sell out his body.
on a tackle. Arnone also has atre-
mendous soccer IQ, and uncanny
feel for the game. His speed of
thought is on par with the best at
the collegiate level and he's often
two steps ahead of his defenders
by the time he receives the ball.
That intelligence might just lead
to a professional contract after
graduation.
This past summer, Arnone
trained with Sporting Kansas
City and the Philadelphia Union
of Major League Soccer, spend-
ing a week with both clubs. His
workouts were not official trials,
but he gained professional expe-
rience playing alongside the likes
of United States National Team
members Graham Zusi and Matt
Besler.
"I would love to be in the
MLS," Arnone said. "I'm a big
family person, and I don't know
if I want to go overseas and leave
my family and friends."
He paused, reconsiding what
he's just said. "But don't get me
wrong, if the opportunity pre-
sented itself, I'm going."
Back in the Michigan locker
room, Arnone has just finished
putting on his cleats. His head is
bobbing to Billy Joel's "We Didn't
Start the Fire."
He's no longer playing music
in the tangible sense, butwith the
way he orchestrates the Michi-
gan offense, he might as well be.
He turns up the volume in his
headphones, feeling the music
course through him. His body is
loose, light. His mind circles back
to what an old coach once told
him after a game, that he was
only as good as the last match
he's played.
"You're only as good as the
person you are today, too,"
Arnone said. "Today's a new day.
Time to get better."

Softball
releases
2014
schedule
By CLARENCE STONE
For the Daily
The Michigan women's softball
team released its 2014 schedule
Tuesday revealing a slate includ-
ing three 2013 Women's College
World Series teams. The Wolver-
ines are coming off a strong year
in 2013 that featured a Big Ten
title and an appearance inthe 2013
Women's College World Series.
The 2014 squad looks to be just
as good, if not better, than last
year's team with the return of
second-team All American short-
stop sophomore Sierra Romero
and classmate Sierra Lawrence -
both of whom played for the USA
Junior National team last season.
Michigan is scheduled to open
its season at the USF Wilson-
Demarini Tournament in Tampa,
Fla. The Wolverines' first game is
against Florida, another partici-
pant in the 2013 WCWS, followed
by another tough game against
South Florida. After that, they'll
go back to Lafayette, La. to play
in the Ragin' Cajun Invitational.
Last year, the Wolverines beat
Louisiana-Lafayette twice in two
highly-contested games.
"You go into every season with
the end in mind, and the purpose
of the preseason is to prepare for a
run at winning it all," said Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins. "I'm
excited about it."
But, the difficulty of the Wol-
verines' schedule doesn't stop
after the first two tournaments.
On March 6, they'll play in the
Judi Garman Classic, where
they'll have the chance to play two
other WCWS participants, Texas
and Washington.
The Huskies eliminated Michi-
gan from the WCWS in the second
round lastyear. Hutchins, though,
isn't looking past game No. 1.
"We focus on ourselves and
we don't focus any specific oppo-
nent," Hutchins said. "Our goal
is to play the game, and the game
doesn't know who's playing, who's
ranked and who's supposed to
win."
When Michigan returns for its
first home game at Alumni Field
against Bowling Green, it will be
greeted by some upgrades includ-
ing a new AstroTurf field.
"The biggest excitement with
AstroTurf is that it may give us
more practice opportunities,"
Hutchins said. "Being outdoors is
very important, and we will get to
go outside more often. We were
able to get most of our games in
last season with the field we had,
but the conditions were some-
times too wet for practices. The
new turf will give us more prac-
tices and I'm excited for it."
The 2014 season for the Wol-
verines begins Feb. 9.

like Michigan, where you have
the bestofthe best, for some peo-
ple it's easy to lose appreciation
for it, but that quote is something
I value every day. Just being here
and going to school at Michigan,
playing sports here, it's unbeliev-
able."
Coming out of high school,
Arnone was on cloud nine. His
high-school team had just won
the state championship. His club
team went to the national cham-
pionship. He was a top recruit
headed to St. John's in nearby
Queens, N.Y. on a full scholar-
ship. But all the accolades, all the
promise, would be short-lived.
"You're not good enough to

Arnone had never needed
to put the hours in to improve
at the trumpet. But on the soc-
cer field, there was much to be
done - skills to polish, people
to impress, a spot to earn. Burns
and the coaching staff tran-
sitioned Arnone, who was an
attacking midfielder in high
school, to a more defensive role,
but at just 5-foot-10, 160 pounds,
he was considerably undersized
for his position. Getting stron-
ger was his top priority to keep
pace in the Big Ten and to have a
legitimate presence on the pitch.
He put on nearly 15 pounds of
muscle last offseason and hopes
to add more.
Nearly three years have passed
since his transfer, and Arnone

Finn flies to Big Ten Championship

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
For 5,800 meters at Sunday's
Big Ten cross country champion-
ship, freshman Erin Finn refused
to letherselfthink she could win.
But with 200 meters to go, she
could no longer ignore the lead
she had on Michigan State's Leah
O'Connor, or the fact that she
was about to become Michigan's
first individual women's cross
country conference champion
since 2006.
As a team, the 14th-ranked
Wolverines finished second to
No. 6 Michigan State. Junior
Megan Weschler and sopho-
mores Shannon Osika and Taylor
Manett took home second-team
All-Big Ten honors. The trio fin-
ished in 10th, 11th and 14th place,
respectively.'
While the Wolverines were
unable to defend their team
championship, Finn made sure
there was still a trophy to bring
back to Ann Arbor.

"Even though we didn't win as
a team, I feel like my individual
(title) is really a team win," Finn
said. "I could not have done it
without their help."
Finn said her teammates have
helped her in the tough adjust-
ment to college, and that few peo-
ple were happier for her than the
people she worked hard with all
season long. Redshirt junior Tay-
lor Pogue, ateam leader and key
contributor, missed the champi-
onship meet due to injury.
"It was definitely hard men-
tally and in the team results,
but we knew we had to do what
was best for her," Finn said. "We
went in with the mentality of,
'Let's race for Taylor."'
Without Pogue to bolster the
Wolverines' scorecard, the Spar-
tans ultimately came away victo-
rious in a meet that came down
to Michigan, Michigan State and
No. 16 Minnesota.
Before the race began, Finn
had accomplished more than
many runners on the starting

line. She was a national record-
holder in the 5,000-meter race
in high school, an All-American
and a member of Team USA
before stepping foot on campus
this summer.-
With all of her pre-collegiate
success, many expected Finn
would challenge for an all-con-
ference spot, and once the gun
sounded, her killer instinct took
over.
"We knew she was going to
run'out in the first wave of lead-
ers," said Michigan coach Mike
McGuire. "She made the decision
to leave the chase pack and ven-
ture out on the leader at the time.
"(As she ran by) she literally
just said to me she felt great,"
McGuire said. "I said, 'Just go for
it, then.'"
Finn then showed off another
gear, as she established an eight-
second lead at the three-kilome-
ter point and held that margin
until she finished in 20:48.3.
"I was extremely excited, but
mostly shocked," Finn said.

Finn's win also continued
Michigan's three-year run of
having the conference's fastest
freshman.
McGuire and Finn both credit
the team-first mentality of the
Wolverines' program and team
leadership for the recent success
of Michigan's young runners.
"It's a quantum leap up to this
level," McGuire said. "The best
resource a young (runner) will
have is their teammates."
Added Finn: "It's different
than in high school, where I felt
like a lot of my wins were real-
ly individual. This one was so
team-based."
Still, Finn found herself alone
in the final stretch of the race, far
separated from her teammates
and most of her competitors.
At that point, she talked herself
through the finish.
"I just told myself 'push.'"
Finn said. "Push hard, and you're
going to be the Big Ten cham-
pion."

The Michigan Daily.- michigandaily.cam 01

To change results,
Hoke changes little

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
leadership council meets every
Sunday, but the most recent
meeting felt different, said fifth-
year senior wide receiver Jere-
my Gallon. Because it was a loss,
he explained. And they knew
"we need to up the ante."
These upperclassmen have
dealt with tough losses before,
but this most recent one, to
Michigan State on Saturday,
may have been the toughest
during Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's three seasons here. The
1 29-6 loss was the most lopsided
in that span besides the defeat
to Alabama. The Spartans didn't
just beat the Wolverines, they
beat them up.
Michigan State's defense
abused weak protection and
battered redshirt junior quar-
terback Devin Gardner for
seven sacks. Seeing his friend
hit so many times, Gallon said
on Tuesday, "it broke my little
heart."
So what has changed this
week? Not much, said-numerous
players and coaches. That's by
design, and for Hoke, it's been
successful - except for losses to
Ohio State and South Carolina
last season, Michigan has never
dropped two in a row under
Hoke. And even the consecutive
defeats last year were hardly
back to back - they were sepa-
rated by more than a month.
The secret is, there is no
secret. Hoke said he doesn't
recall what he did after losses
to prevent another from occur-
ring.
"I wish I could remember,"
Hoke said. "It's probably being
consistent in what we do."
Hoke has shown emotion
on the field but remains even-
keeled off. He has rarely, if ever,
raised his voice in a press con-
ference. After the loss Saturday,
he was in control. That, offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges said,
makes it easier for the team to
bounce back.
"The team will react a lot
the way the head coach reacts,"
Borges said. "The head coach
sets the tone. The key to not los-
ing a lot of games, in my opinion,
or not going into the tank, is not
overreacting. Reacting, don't get

me wrong, that game was not
played well and there has to be
a reaction, no ifs, ands or buts.
But not overreacting so much
that you do something that pulls
the team right in the tank.
"And he's as good as anybody
I've ever seen about making
sure mistakes are fixed but not
dwelling on it so much that the
next opponent will beat you,
too."
Still, Michigan will be tested
Saturday ' against Nebraska.
Besides South Carolina, the
Cornhuskers will be the tough-
est team it has faced following
a loss, from a list that compris-
es Purdue, Illinois, Air Force,
Purdue (again), Minnesota and
Indiana.
Borges admitted that in a lot
of ways, Saturday's game was
frustrating. The failure to pro-
tect Gardner and to establish
a run game felt maddening at
times.
"Several cuss words came out
of my mouth during that game,"
he said.
He added that he has been
on teams when the coach has
overreacted, and the team has
tanked. The key is to make the
necessary changes but let go of
the frustration.
"Do you want your leader to
freak out?" Borges said. "Do you
want George Patton to go crazy

in the middle of a battle and get
everyone killed? No. He had a
bad temper, and Brady does,
too. So do I. But if cooler heads
prevail at the end of the day -
you can have your explosions -
but at the end of the day when
everything settles, if your leader
shows a leadership composure,
then generally they'll recover."
Anyway, Borges said, he
cursed several times during the
Indiana game two weeks ago,
too. Michigan broke several
offensive records that day.
After Saturday, players said
they couldn't notice a difference
in Hoke. There was no extra
running, no added tension, no
emotion out of the ordinary.
Junior defensive ends Frank
Clark and Brennen Beyer said
they would prefer a younger
teammate have a level head than
be over-eager to avenge a loss
they can't change.
The key to that, Gallon said, is
to provide an example.
"We feed off of each other,"
Gallon said. "If I see (fifth-year
senior left tackle Taylor Lewan)
and Devin smiling and ready,
I'm ready."
And at the first practice, after
Michigan's toughest loss in
years, what did Gallon see?
"Smiles," he said. "I didn't see
nobody hanging their head feel-
ing sorry for themselves."

was to throw the ball on first

son in order to set up the run. The
Spartan defense is one of the best
in the country at stopping the
run, and Michigan has struggled
to get its rushing game going this
season.
"Our approach was not to

to pick your shots, but pick them

Borges used this example to
show that two years could make
all of the difference for his inex-

sons)," Borges said.
Borges added that one reason
the offensive line is one of the
easier positions to develop is that
so much growth can come from
learning and chemistry there. He

Despite losses, Pearson
enjoys return toYost

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
Mel Pearson's return to Ann
Arbor last weekend was no happy
homecoming.
After a 23-year stint as an assis-
tant coach of the Michigan hockey
team, Pearson accepted the head
coaching position with Michigan
Tech in 201. Last weekend, the
Wolverines welcomed the Huskies
(1-6-1) to Yost Ice Arena - the first
time in almost three decades that
the two teams met on the home ice
of either school.
Pearson's team put up quite a
fight, but both games of the two-
game series ended with close
Michigan victories. The Wolver-
ines (6-1-1) triumphed on Friday
in overtime, 3-2, and staved off a
comeback the following night to
win 2-1.
"We've had a real tough sched-
ule, and I put our team in a tough
spot," Pearson said after Satur-
day's game. "I did that for a rea-
son. We want to play good teams
in good buildings.... It can be frus-
trating."
It doesn't get much more dif-
ficult than facing No. 2 Michigan
at Yost, but the competitiveness
of both games was a testament
to how far Pearson has brought
the program in just two years.
In 2010-11, the Huskies won four
games and lost 30. But last year,
Michigan Tech beat No. 1 Min-
nesota, No. 7 St. Cloud State and
No.14 Nebraska-Omaha, marquee

wins for a program that hasn't
won a national championship
since 1975 or made a Frozen Four
since its last NCAA Tournament
appearance in 1981.
And last December, the Hus-
kies routed the Wolverines at the
Great Lakes Invitational, going on
to claim the tournament title for
the first time in 32 years. Pearson's
teams won 29 games in two years
entering this season, good for the
best two-season stretch in the last
18 years of Michigan Tech hockey.
But last weekend, the Huskies'
only victories were moral ones.
"We've taken our lumps right
now," Pearson said. "I think the
record is a little misleading. I like
the way we're playing right now."
Despite leaving Yost without a
win, Pearson said his return was
"awesome." He already helped
facilitate two more scheduled
games between the programs -
in Houghton, Mich. next year and
back in Ann Arbor for 2015-16 -
and hopes the former CCHA rivals
continue to play regularly.
"(Yost) is a place I love," Pear-
son said. "I know it's ahard place
to play and a hard place to win at,
but I think it's a great experience
for our players."
And though he and Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson insisted
the meeting between the two
longtime friends and former col-
leagues was purely business, the
two spared some time to catch up.
Pearson brought with him a pack-

Michigan coach Red Berenson enjoyed

Peninsula culinary staple - as a
gift, and the two promised to stay
in tguch until they meet again.
"I love coach Berenson and
Michigan hockey," Pearson said.
"I'm glad they're doing well, and
I'm really happy for them and I
know they're going to have a great
year."
Note: Berenson confirmed that
defenseman Kevin Lohan suc-
cessfully underwent surgery on
Monday afternoon. The fresh-
man suffered a right knee injury
after sliding awkwardly into the
boards on Friday. Berenson called
the injury a "worst-case scenario"
and that the procedure involved
reconstruction. Lohan will miss at
least three months.

I started loving myseit one dtay
because I stopped giving myself
any other option. Because I was
exhausted from the relentless,
daily routine of picking out my
flaws or mistakes and hating
myself for them. Because living
in a world that finds silent yet
powerful ways to encourage me
to dislike myself feels almost as
bad as giving in. And I was done.
Or at the very least, I made the
decision to try and stop. Unlearn-
ing the toxic lens through which
I have learned to see myself is
no easy task. Loving yourself is
all but impossible when you are
constantly reminded - by not
only pop culture, but by your
own brain - that you have fat
thighs and are oversensitive to
boot. Utterly spent by the pro-
cess of tearing myself down, I
tentatively set off on the first leg of
my journey: trying to love my body.
I started following all of the
"body positive" blogs I could find, I
spent hours in front of my bedroom
mirror trying to convince myself
that what I saw staring back at me,
annoyed and exposed, was beauti-
ful. And some days, I really believed
it. I saw my dimpled thighs, I saw
my long nose, and I felt pretty
despite them. But usually, I found
myself repeating empty words at
my reflection: "you are beautiful,
you are beautiful, you are beauti-
ful." Frustrated with the double
standards before me - like a Dove

meant the most to me was the
simple idea that our bodies are

interface with which we experi-

that operates nonstop, all with the
sole purpose of keeping us alive.
Most importantly, we only get this
one. When I think of it that way, it
almost feels criminal not to be in
constant awe of my powerful legs,
crooked ears and organs inside my
stomach.
One of the best side effects of
loving yourself is that the criti-
cism you are trained to project
onto others diminishes as well.
Especially for women, body image
is learned as an incredibly competi-
tive notion. Many of us are condi-
tioned to hate those we perceive as
prettier than ourselves, and to feel

n Ann Arbor's most notorious
basement, known for its sticky
dance floor and neon, liquor-infused
shark bowls, LSA senior Ben Gyarmati
does his homework.
It's a far cry from the Shapiro
Undergraduate Library. But for
Gyarmati, Rick's American Cafd, where
hours later patrons will flash credit cards
and dollar bills, doubles as a study space.
As one might imagine, it's not the most
productive of environments.
"It's a very hard place to get work
done," Gyarmati said. "Especially when
the DJ comes in and starts playing
techno with no lyrics."
For most students who venture to the
basement of 611 Church Street, where
Rick's is located, studies are the last thing
on the mind. But for those like Gyarmati,
a bartender at the bar, downtime at work
means a chance to catch up on reading
for class. And while some students opt
for more traditional part-time jobs -
like retail jobs or University Housing
positions - others are drawn to gigs at
bars.
The 'social aspect'
To Engineering senior Mike Oles, who
also works at Rick's, work rarely feels
like work.
"A lot of other jobs are like, 'Oh crap,
I have to go to work,' " Oles said. "But I
don't dread it. Work is fun for me."
Part of what makes the shifts
so enjoyable for him is the ability

to socialize on the job. Once Oles
has completed his duties, which
include bussing tables and running
the dishwasher, his supervisors are
generally OK with him chatting with
friends.
The camaraderie among co-workers
has been instrumental to the college
career of Gyarmati. He transferred to
the University from Michigan State
University after the first semester of
his freshman year, which caused him
to "miss the pivotal time of meeting
people in the dorms," he said. His job
at Rick's has allowed him to find a
close-knit friend group.
Weekends spentbehind the bar instead
of ordering drinks is also a plus for Rick's
employees.
Gyarmati said he prefers bartending to
the three bouncer positions at the bottom
of the Rick's staircase because "it's more
lucrative."
With the amount of time employees
spend at Rick's -on the clock, one
would think they would stay away in
their free time. But that doesn't seem
to be the case. Oles cites the half-off
employee discount as a reason to visit
the bar on nights off.
"I go into the night thinking I'm going
to stay away, but monetarily there's no
reason to stay away," Oles said. "And it's
fun to see the staff."
Students policing students
The indignant _ customer who has

had a few too many shark bowls
might not realize it, but it's possible
the bartender who cuts him or her
off could be in their chemistry
lecture. Oles said 90-95 percent of
the Rick's staff are students either at
the University or Eastern Michigan
University.
"Sometimes you get people who say,
'Oh, you're going nowhere in life because
you work at Rick's,' " Oles said. "But I
don't think they understand that I'm also
a student."
Oles added that he can laugh off the
disrespect, which usually comes from
patrons who are being kicked out -
something he said happens once or twice
each shift.
Gyarmati believes customers would
be more polite if they realized he's a
classmate of theirs. In his experience,
the hardest ones to deal with are outside
of the bar.
"It's understandable in some
aspects. It's a long-ass line out in the
cold," he said.
"When you're bouncing, you'll get
treated like shit by a lot of people,"
Gyarmati said. "They'll be like, 'Oh
sweet, you work minimum wage at a
bar.' But I'm also getting a University of
Michigan education. It's not like this is
my life.".
Stories to last a lifetime
Life at Rick's for Oles and Gyarmati
comes with eIldless tales of patrons'

drunken debauchery.
One night, Gyarmati watched a fight
break out on the sidewalk outside of the
bar, and he sprinted in to break up the'
scuffle.
Gyarmati pinned one of the unruly
customers to the ground, but because
his zip-up hooded sweatshirt covered
up the word "staff" on the back of his
work T-shirt, a policeman mistook him
for one of the perpetrators.
The next thing Gyarmati remembers,
his face was on fire. The cops had
sprayed mace, and his efforts to play
peacemaker had only earned him agony.
But life at Rick's provides the
ammunition for less painful stories too,
like the time Oles observed someone in
line name-drop a co-worker to another
bouncer.
"You don't know Cory Davis like I
do," Oles recalls him saying.
Little did the arrogant customer
know, he was actually talking to Davis's
twin brother, who also works at Rick's.
For Oles, Gyarmati and the rest of the
students behind the scenes at Rick's, a
job at the bar simply makes sense. But
what does it take to be a good fit for a
job at Rick's or another popular off-.,
campus bar?
"Someone with work ethic who' is
willing to give up weekend nights,"
Oles said.
"Just try to be easy going," Gyarmati
said. "If you're a bartender, you're going
to be yelled-at. You've basically just got "~
to be calm and be focused."

CONTINUED FROM PAGESB
According to Carlson, the main appeal at
the time was the live music. They went to Ann
Arbor's other popular spots, like the Union,
which used to sell alcohol. But even when they
started elsewhere, Carlson and her friends
eventually made their way to Rick's when
they wanted to dance. Whereas the other
bars cranked out radio songs and didn't have
a space for dancing, Rick's offered interest-
ing music and, according to Carlson, a "better
atmosphere."
"They had a dance floor; they had the bands;
it was good," Carlson said.
As it turns out, Madonna isn't the only one
who forged a special connection at 611 Church.
On one of her Rick's nights in 1982, Carlson
started talking with a complete stranger. They
danced; heboughteher a drink. For months, she
saw him around campus, remembering him as
the guy she met at Rick's. Almost a year after
their chance meeting, the two began dating.
Karen and Mark Carlson graduated in 1984
and married in 1987. Twenty-six years later,
two of their three children are University
students. Carlson said her daughter Sara - a
senior in the Stamps School of Art & Design
- goes to Rick's with her friends, just like her
mother used to.
"And then her friends will look around and
say, 'Hey, doyou think our husbands are here?"'
BEAT GOES ON
According to Hesse, the general manager,
the live music started tapering off and then
'stopped completely about seven years ago.
Now, live performances only happen in rare
instances. The Business School band, for
example, plays a few times a year. But, as Hesse
explained, for a bar to host liveshows success-
fully, bands have to be booked consistently,
four or five nights a week.
The recognizable, respected bands the
Rick's management wanted to book started
getting tooexpensive, and there was also the
risk of becoming too niche. If Rick's booked
an '80s cover band, they ran the risk of losing'
customers who might not like sweaty 20-year-
olds screaming Michael Jackson covers.
So, in the early 2000s, Rick's started transi-
tioning into featuring DJs one or two nights a
week, and those nights becamethe most popular.
"And the local band market just dried up,"
Hesse explained. "So even the least expen-
sive bands were twice as much as a DJ. It got
to the point where it just financially didn't
make sense for us."
The switch to DJs allowed Rick's to cater to
a wider range of music tastes and requests.
Recent University alum Julie Ruppe
remembers Rick's the same way as Carlson
does: as a place to dance with your friends and
have a great time.
"I went at least twice a week," Ruppe said,
explaining that she usually went with the
group of girls she lived with, which includ-
ed members of Delta Gamma, her soror-
ity. Rick's even weighed into her decision to
live at "Chillard," a house on the corner of
Church and Willard.
"As long as you brought the right group of

"A lot can happen
at Rick's ... Some,
good, some bad
and some so utterly
life-changing that
you wake up every
day and just have to
smile at the mere,
thought of it."
- JULIE RUPPE,
RECENT UNIVERSITY ALUM
people, you'd always have agood time," Ruppe
said. "It's just the only club on campus -if you
can even call it a club - where you can dance
with all your friends everywhere, and I think
that's-really fun."
Ruppe's advice to Rick's first timers like
us is to "expect the unexpected." Just last
year, Ruppe was at Rick's enjoying what she
described as "an extraordinarily delicious
vodka soda" mixed by one of her favorite
bartenders, and the all too familiar "Call Me
Maybe" started playing. On awhim, she decid-
ed to sing the song to a stranger. She picked a
random guy, serenaded him, danced for a few
more songs and put her number in his phone.
Three weeks later, she agreed to go on a
date with him, even though she didn't even
know his name. Having little faith that the
date would lead to anything other than a nice
lunch, she wore an "ugly hipster grandma"
sweater and met him at Sava's.
When she met her mysterious date, he
told her he was from Germany. She had just
returned from a study abroad trip to Germa-
ny, and they connected instantly. The couple
recently celebrated the one-year anniversary
of that first date in Berlin where they now live
and work together.
"A lot can happen at Ricks," Ruppe
wrote in an e-mail with the subject line
"Til Rick's do us part."
"Some good, some bad and some so utterly
life-changing that you wake up every day and
just have to smile at the mere thought of it."
And it's not only Rick's regulars who have
found love in the dimly lit basementbar. Jenny
Schwartz was a student in the School of Social
Work from2002 to 2004.As agrad student, one
of her favorite bars was Dominick's, and she
rarely made the journey to Rick's. One night of
fall 2003, however, her friends convinced her
to go. Recovering from a cold, the last place
Schwartz wanted to be was out on the town,
especially since she wasn't drinking that night.
"Idon'tknowifit'schangedatall,"Schwartz
said, "but Rick's back then was basically where
you drank and hooked up with random people.
It was notsome place you would go to meet the
future love of your life."

On that night, trying to get out of a con-
versation with another Rick's goer, Schwartz
started talking to a stranger in a Cornell hat.
He was a law student from New York who had
just broken up with his girlfriend of six years.
They talked all night, he walked her home and
she gave him her number.
"They always say that you're going to
meet someone when you least expect it,"
Schwartz said.
Nearly ten years later, the two are married,
have three children and live in West Bloomfield.
ME AGAINST THE MUSIC
Hesse, the general manager, also attributed
the lonigevity of Rick's to the consistent pattern
of top-notch employees.
Like Lily Pike, a 2008 graduate from the
University.Pike joined the staff her junior year,
partially to pay off a car payment she couldn't
afford, and partially just to get in the place.
"I wasn't 21 yet, and I had been going to
Rick's since I was 17," Pike said in a phone
interview. "I had changed my hair, so my ID
didn't work anymore. I needed money, but I
knew if I wanted to be there, I'd need to work
there. Because you can get in there - without
drinking-- if you work there."
But, as she found out, being part of the sober
population at Rick's is - surprisingly enough
- a bit different.
"Everyone's wasted, and you're sober," Pike
said. "You see guys whipping out their dicks
and peeing on the bar Y-" ,
We stopped her: You actually saw that
happen?
"Oh yeah," Pike said. "They don't want to
wait in line for bathroom, so they pee right
next to the bar. I've seen guys getting kicked
out constantly for that."
And when the bouncers aren't throwing
out the urinary exhibitionists, they're trying
to keep one of the most inebriated crowds on
campus under control.
Easier said than done.
"One time, we had to take a guy out, and he
grabbed onto my shirt and wouldn't let go,"
said Roth, a Rick's bouncer. "And he tore the
shirt off me."
But overall, Roth says, the employees at
Rick's do a decent job of keeping anarchy to a
minimum, and that "very rarely have I seen
one of my co-workers have to, like, punch
someone in the face."
And as for what Rick's looks like after last
call and once the lights turn on, it's certainly
not for the faint of heart, or the sober of mind.
"It's a mess," Pike said. "You see purses left
behind, heels of shoes, jackets, cell phones.
Cheap stuff and really expensive stuff, sur-
rounded by puke."
But as the old saying goes, from the stinkiest
puke comes the sweetest love. Or, at least that
was the case for Pike. A co-worker-turned-
manager, Matt Dedes, added another hyphen
to his title in 2009: boyfriend.
"He was so sweet," Pike said. "He,used to
walk me home every night after close."
After months of just being friends, Pike took
a sabbatical from Rick's for an internship in
Washington; D.C. Once she came back to Ann

Arbor, she went to Rick's and saw Matt. They
set up their first date the very next day. And
now -
"Now we've been together for five years,"
Pike said. Just last month, Pike ("finally," she
said) convinced Matt to come with her to Bos-
ton, leaving behind the bar they both loved to
start a new life together.
"I guess he couldn't handle the constant
river of puke, scantily clad angry girls cold in
line, nor the deep and dark cavernous habitat
of Rick's," Pike said in an e-mail. "It's good
for a night or two, but not for a lifetime. Love
found there, on-the other hand, is for a lifetime.
#ricksloveforlife"
FUTURE LOVERS
When told about the influx of stories we've
received aboutcouples finding their loved ones
at Rick's, Hesse chuckled.
"I met my wife here," he said.
His experience, like the others, wasn't
something he had planned for or sought out.
It was 1997, and Hesse - a senior at the time
- was working on a particularly slow Sunday
night. His friend showed up on a double date,
and one of the girls started talking to Hesse.
In fact, she ended up talking to him more than
her date.
A month later, they went out, and another
month after that, they became serious. They've
been married for 16 years, the same amount of
time Hesse has been with Rick's.
But Hesse has also experienced a different
type of love during his time as general man-
ager. He described the outpouring of apprecia-
tion he gets from people who "live and die" by
Rick's. He said getting people out the door on
graduation weekend is always a struggle.
"The people make Rick's what it is," he said.
"At graduation last year, I had so many people
shake my hand and girls giving me hugs say-
ing, 'Thanks, it was the best senior year ever."'
For Ruppe in Berlin, the other Rick's
- memory that stands out as much as the night
she met her boyfriend was on her very last
night at 611 Church. It was right after gradu-
ation, and Ruppe was there with 15 of the
girls she lived with. Vitamin C's "Gradua-
tion" began to play.
"We all put our arms around each other and
just started crying in the middle of Rick's," she
said. "It was our last night all together, our
last night at Rick's. Everyone's graduating and
moving different places, and it'sjust a very ste-
reotypical moment and also very fitting that it
was at Rick's."
It's not necessarily for everyone, especially
if you're not the dancing type. But the legend-
ary bar offers its fair share of surprises. Maybe
you could meet the love of your life at Rick's.
Or, like us, you could just end up dancing on
the stage with your closest friends and leftover
pasta. Or, you could walk in, pay $6 for a shot,
look around and leave (we did that one night,
too). In any case, the basement of 611 Church
has been the setting for endless late-night
tales, Ann Arbor history and its fair share of
real-life meet-cutes.
Here's looking at you, Rick's ...but not when
the lights are on. No one wantsto see that.

According to The New
York Times, a recent
analysis of data by NASA
found that "one of every
five sun-like stars" has an
Earth-size planet circling
at just the right distance
where liquid water could
exist. The next time you
feel alone in this world,
think about the t ther
40 billion potentially
NASA/AP Photo habitable planets.

After being lost for at least 70years, 1,500
pieces of art taken by the Nazis were found in
a Munich apartment, according to CNN. The
art, valued at more than $1 billion, includes
pieces by Matisse and Picasso.

mystery, but we dove inwith open minds and mouths, ready for
whatever Ripk's could throw at us. The first things thrown -
well, handed - were two glasses filled to the brim with a thick
pink concoction known as a Mindprobe, the house drink. We'd
tell you what's in it, but no one really seems to know.
On our very first trip to the bar, we brought a whole crew
of Kerrytown-dwelling Rick's-virgins. Mindprobes in hand,
and leftover pasta we ate communally from a Tupperware, We
made our way to the sweaty and slippery dance floor. It prob-
ably wasn't a sight typical to the average Rick's night, but sur-
prises became a recurring theme during our Rick's expedition.
Unlike Madonna - who recalled the story of meeting Bray
in a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone, saying "those were
good days" - we didn't find love. But we did discover an entire
subculture built around the famed bar, a subculture that has
persisted through decades of changes.

Love it or hate it, through the years, Rick's has become
one of the most talked about fixtures of campus nightlife. In
August, it was named one of the top-25 college bars in the
country by The Daily Meal. It's the only club in Ann Arbor
that's ever had a (now-defunct) website devoted to its line.
N A In both 2008 and 2011, The Michigan Review, a conservative
IT publication, deemed it the "worst bar in Ann Arbor," saying
"You might have taken home a good hook-up a few times, but
E you probably also took home a nasty case of Syphilis, as well."
Our first mystery to solve about the bar: Rick. Is there a
EDTR Rick?Who is he?
Chris Hesse, general manager of Rick's, laughed when we
asked if he had ever met Rick.
"There really is no 'The Rick,' "he said, leaning back in his
chair in the office tucked away just to the left of the steps that
lead down from Church Street into the dark world of Rick's.
We spoke with Hesse the day after Halloween, one of the
busiestnight's for the bar. It was 11 a.m. on a Friday, andthe bar
that had -justnine hoursbefore - held hundreds of inebriated
cats, zombies, vamps and Mileys was now occupied by employ-
ees wielding mops, cleaning up the sticky mess of glitter and
spilled drinks leftover fromthe night's celebrations. The silence
and (slightly) brighter lighting were bizarrely jarring: This was
Rick's during daylight, our glimpse behind the curtain.
Hesse told us that the man often confused as the original
G "Rick" was Rick Novak, a manager and partner of the bar in
the '80s. But it wasn't Novak who gave the bar its name.

Named after "Rick's Cafe Amdricain" - the swanky night-

. Even though he was - Johnson and Crawley transformed the Blue Frogge into the
d. bar and dance club it is now in 1979.

basement that doubles culminating in the federal Drinking Age Act of 1984, crack-
downs on underage drinking hit Ann Arbor - and they hit

hard. According to the 1982 edition of the Michiganensian,
bartenders and managers alike were shocked not only.by the
fines bartenders could incur by serving the now-minors, but
also the new tactics employed to ensure Freshman Drinker.2.0
couldn't sneak a beer in local bars.
"One of the latest tactics for catching these lawbreakers is to
send in burly, balding 19 /2 year-olds into bars to get served,"
the Michiganensian reporter wrote, "and report the bartender
to authorities who are planted at the bar."
"It really is a sad situation," one Rick's manager told the
same Michiganensian reporter. "Since the enforcement of the
drinking age, our bars are only half full."
Campus staples like Charley's, which opened its doors in
1979, old-timer The Brown Jug, established in 1936, and Rick's
endured the end of (legally) liquored-up minors. Hesse said
he isn't surprised by the initial hit Rick's'took after the legal
drinking age changed.
He said current age restrictions on Rick's actually work to
its advantage. The new 21-and-over policy helped establish the
reputation of Rick's as a hangout spot for older students.
"I think one of the reasons Rick's has sustained so well ...
-is that this has kind of been known as the senior bar," he said.
"It's where the 21 and overs hang out. We like to think it's the
hardest bar to get into on campus."
Not that the bar's zero-tolerance policy stops under-
classmen from trying.
"People get crazy trying to get in," said LSA sophomore Jor-
dan Roth, who bounces at Rick's. "Girls have offered me num-
bers. Guys try to give me an extra $20."
Roth said the pressure can be tempting, "but if that per-
son gets drunk, then whoever was checking IDs is in big
trouble. It's not worth it,"
But for better or for worse, keeping Rick's minor-free has
built up its reputation asan exclusively upperclassmen bar.
"Senior year, everyone was very drunk and emotional all
the time," Recent alum Proma Kholsa said. "And there's no
place better than Rick's for that sort of business."
"You say to yourself, 'It's gonna be dark, sweaty and crowd-
ed. And maybe there will be a stranger creeping on me.' You
know it's gonna happen, and you're fine with it."
Hesse said he believes that regular customers know what
they're getting when they cometo Rick's and that the bar never
tries to be anything it's not. That understanding of the atmo-
sphere and low-key look of Rick's contributes to its endurance.
"People know what Rick's is," Hesse said. "We know we're
not a big fancy Chicago, Vegas, New York-style club, and we
don't try to be ... I mean, if you look around, it's a dingy, dark
basement bar. People make of it what they make of it."
Age restrictions aren't the only major changes Rick's has
undergone through the decades. Shortly after Rick's first
opened, it became known for its live music. The stage that's
now recognized for uncoordinated bumping-and-grinding-
and-falling once hosted performers like Matt "Guitar" Mur-
phy, a - you guessed it - guitarist in the Blues Brothers, who
played Aretha Franklin's husband in the movie of the same
name, hit Rick's several times in the early '80s. The Pixies
played there in 1988. So did Primus - a.k.a. the guys who do
the "South Park" theme.
University alum Karen Carlson frequented Rick's in the
early 1980s.
"People would go to Rick's for the bigger night outs," she
said. "If you were really wanting to go out for a big night, not
necessarily a dressy night, but just a nice, long night of hanging
quut with your friends and having drinks and stuff, Rick's was
always on the to-do list."
