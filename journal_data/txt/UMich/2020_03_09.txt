BERNIE
RALLIES
ON DIAG

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
sat 
down with Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., for a few minutes before 
his rally on the Diag at the 
University of Michigan. Sanders 
won Michigan in the 2016 
presidential primary, and the 

state remains crucial for him 
after former Vice President Joe 
Biden won decisive victories on 
Super Tuesday. 
In his interview, Sanders 
discussed his efforts to appeal 
to moderate voters, how to get 
young voters to turn out and 
his plan for student loan debt 
cancellation.
The 
Michigan 
Daily: 
Michigan is a purple state, 
so how do you appeal to 

voters 
in 
the 
middle 
who 
value 
bipartisanship? 
Is 
bipartisanship 
important 
to 
you?
Bernie Sanders: Sure it is. 
And we appeal to voters based on 
the issues that we are proposing 
and fighting for, which appeal 
to a broad spectrum of the 
American 
people, 
whether 
they’re Democrats, Republicans 
or Independents. 

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

A

s Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took 
a moment to look out onto the 
sea of attendees at his rally on 
the University of Michigan Diag, 
he addressed the crowd: “So right now, in this 
moment, we have got to look around us and 
what we have got to determine is whether you’re 
satisfied with the status quo.” 
On Sunday evening, more than 10,000 
students, faculty and Ann Arbor residents took 
to the Diag, wearing Sanders’s campaign gear 
waving white and blue “Bernie” campaign signs. 
Students began lining up as many as five hours 
before the rally was scheduled to begin at 6 p.m.
LSA senior Martha Abrams got in line at 1 
p.m. and said she is voting for Sanders primarily 
because of his consistently held positions. She also 
said his positions on crime and the environment 

are reasons for her support. 
“He has a consistent record in regards to 
criminal justice reform and being against mass 
incarceration, whereas Biden definitely doesn’t,” 
Abrams said. “(Biden) has passed legislation (...) 
that really helped establish the carceral state as it 
exists today. With the environment, Bernie seems 
to be one of the frontrunners in acknowledging 
how pressing that issue is.” 
The rally featured a spate of Michigan and 
national political figures including U.S. Rep. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., 
former 
gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed and 
state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor.
El-Sayed rallied the crowd when he spoke 
before Ocasio-Cortez or Sanders took the stage.

EMMA RUBERG, JASMIN LEE & JULIA FANZERES | Daily Staff Reporters

Al Gore, vice president to 
former President Bill Clinton 
from 1993 to 2001, will speak 
at the University of Michigan 
Spring Commencement May 2 
at Michigan Stadium.
In 2000, Gore was the 
Democratic 
candidate 
for 
president and lost to Republican 
George W. Bush. 
A University press release 
announcing 
his 
appearance 
emphasized 
Gore’s 
environmental work. In 2007, 
Gore was honored with the 
Nobel Peace Prize alongside 
the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change for highlighting 
climate issues.
“As 
vice 
president 
from 

1993 to 2001, Gore helped 
negotiate the Kyoto Protocol 
that committed industrialized 
nations to reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions,” the press release 
reads. “He also championed 
science and technology.”
The 
2006 
film 
“An 
Inconvenient Truth” featured 
Gore and his effort to convince 
people 
about 
the 
urgency 
of climate change. It won 
an Academy Award for Best 
Documentary. Gore is also the 
author of several books on global 
warming and the controversial 
politics surrounding the issue.
Currently, 
Gore 
is 
the 
co-founder 
and 
chair 
of 
Generation 
Investment, 
an 
investment 
firm 
that 
emphasizes sustainability, and 
Climate Reality, which works to 
combat global warming. 

He also serves on Apple Inc.’s 
board of directors and as a 
senior partner at venture capital 
firm Kleiner Perkins.
Prior 
to 
becoming 
Vice 
President, Gore served two 
terms 
in 
the 
Senate 
and 
four terms in the House of 
Representatives for Tennessee.
LSA senior Amanda Gross 
said she was excited to have 
Gore serve as the speaker, 
noting 
his 
environmental 
advocacy and political legacy.
“It’s 
incredible 
to 
have 
someone who has never been 
afraid to speak up about the 
realities of climate change and 
who has worked so hard to try 
to champion positive changes 
for not only our nation but the 
world,” Gross said.

Hockey sweeps MSU in first
round of Big Ten Tournament


Sanders 
endorsed 
El-Sayed 
during his campaign for Michigan 
governor, who said his previous 
conversation 
with 
Sanders 
increased 
his 
confidence 
in 
grassroots movements.
“When I ran, I was lucky enough 
to get Bernie’s endorsement. Let 
me tell you about the conversation 
we had,” El-Sayed said. “He didn’t 
ask me what I stood for. He said I 
know what you fight for, but I want 
to know why you fight for it. And I 
told him about my grandmother, 
who never got the opportunity to 
go to school, though she was the 
smartest, wisest woman I have ever 
met. She used to remind me about 
when I go visit that it wasn’t about 
me. It was about the opportunities 
that I had.”
Ocasio-Cortez 
introduced 
Sanders, 
thanking 
Reverend 
Jesse Jackson for his March 7 
endorsement of the senator. She 
discussed Sanders’ long-standing 
support for marginalized groups, 
citing it as a reason for her 
support. She also noted how, as 
mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 
1980s, Sanders endorsed Jackson 
for president at the Burlington 
Democratic presidential caucus.
“When it was time for the 
Vermont caucuses to come around, 
Mayor Sanders stood up to break 
the 
common 
consensus 
and 
endorsed Reverend Jesse Jackson 
for president,” Ocasio-Cortez said. 
“He stood up and delivered that 
speech in the Vermont caucuses. 
He was yelled at, he was hit, but he 
said this is our opportunity to bring 
millions of working people into our 
political process and transform who 
America can work for.” 
Following 
Ocasio-Cortez’s 

introduction, Sanders walked on 
stage as John Lennon’s “Power 
to the People” played in the 
background. Upon entering the 
stage, he thanked Jackson and 
Ocasio-Cortez for their support and 
public service.
“What history is about is to 
understand that there have been 
extraordinarily 
brave 
people 
throughout history,” Sanders said. 
“People who’ve put their lives on 
the line, sometimes who have died, 
gone to jail in the struggle for justice. 
And that is what this campaign is 
about. That is what Jesse Jackson’s 
life has been about, that is what 
Alexandria’s life is about. And that’s 
what I hope all of your lives will be 
about.”
As Ann Arbor undertaken efforts 
to combat climate change, many 
student groups such as the Sunrise 
Movement have endorsed Sanders’ 
aggressive environmental policies. 
Sanders argued for the urgency of 
these policies, stating the United 
States needs to be on the front 
lines of creating and implementing 
new provisions for environmental 
protection. 
“Yes, we will pass legislation 
based on the principles of the Green 
New Deal,” Sanders said. “Climate 
is not just an American issue, but 
a global issue. We are going to lead 
the world and talk to the people 
in China and Russia, India and 
Pakistan ourselves, countries all 
over the world, and make the case 
that maybe instead of spending 
$1.8 trillion a year on weapons of 
destruction, killing each other, (we 
should) fight our common enemy, 
which is climate change.”
Speaking directly to the students 
and teachers in the audience, 
Sanders discussed how his policies 
will promote funding and support 
for education, which prompted 
applause from the crowd. 
Sanders also emphasized the 

value of good public K-12 education. 
He said free primary education 
was no longer sufficient, promising 
to make colleges and universities 
tuition-free.
“Twelve years ago, I talked 
about making public colleges and 
universities like this one tuition-
free,” Sanders said. “In the country, 
states, cities, communities are 
moving to free public colleges and 
universities. As president, that is 
exactly what we will do in every 
state in this country.”
If elected, Sanders said he hopes 
to expand protections under the 
Dream Act and establish a wider 
pathway to citizenship. 
“We are going to bring sweeping 
reform to our immigration system,” 
Sanders said. “I am the son of an 
immigrant and I will not tolerate 
the demonization of immigrants. 
We will restore the executive order 
for the legal status of 1.8 million 
young people eligible for DACA. 
We will end a border policy which 
today allows fed agents to snatch 
babies from the arms of their 
mothers. We will end the ICE raids 
that are terrorizing communities 
and we will pass comprehensive 
bipartisan immigration reform and 
a path towards citizenship.” 
The energy at the rally peaked 
when Sanders began discussing 
reproductive rights and his plan to 
expand funding for women’s health 
care. When he stated his intent 
to increase funding for Planned 
Parenthood, the crowd erupted, 
chanting: “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.” 
“I will never nominate anybody 
who is not 100 percent pro-Roe 
v. Wade (to the Supreme Court),” 
Sanders said. “Trump and his 
friends want to cut funding for 
Planned Parenthood. Well, I’ve got 
bad news for them: we are going 
to expand funding for Planned 
Parenthood. The truth is, it must 
be women who control their own 

bodies, not the government.” 
Some 
students 
who 
were 
attending the rally said they 
used it as an opportunity to 
decide between the other former 
Democratic front-runner Joe Biden 
and Sanders. LSA senior Samantha 
Ilagan said she is worried about the 
senator’s electability. 
“I’m still deciding between 
Bernie and Biden,” Ilagan said. “I 
kind of worry specifically because 
Trump would be the Republican 
nominee and who can do better 
against the end of the general 
election? I think this election, 
in particular, is crucial for that 
specific reason. It’s a choice 
between ideals and electability … 
I’m not exactly sure what the right 
answer is.”
Anticipating some undecided 
voters’ hesitations, Sanders framed 
his campaign as a grassroots 
movement by the people, for the 
people. He said Biden’s campaign 
is supported by the corporate and 
political establishment. 
“We are taking on Joe Biden and 
we are taking on the billionaires 
funding his campaign,” Sanders 
said. “We are taking on the Wall 
Street executives who are helping 
to fund his campaign and we 
are taking on the corporate and 
political establishment. We are 
gonna win this election.” 
Sanders concluded his speech 
with a call for civic participation 
among his supporters.
“Tell your friends that you’re 
tired of them complaining about 
high tuition, student debt, lack of 
health care and low wages and 
unaffordable housing,” Sanders 
said. “Tell them to stop complaining 
at the standoff and fight back. So 
let us go forward. On Tuesday 
let’s win here in Michigan, let’s 
win the Democratic nomination 
and together let us defeat Donald 
Trump.” 

For 
example, 
raising 
the 
minimum wage to 15 bucks an 
hour is enormously popular 
because if you’re a worker who’s 
a Republican making 12 bucks 
an hour, you can’t make it. And 
you want to raise that minimum 
wage. The American people 
now understand that we are the 
only major country on Earth not 
to guarantee health care to all 
people. And yet we’re spending 

twice as much per capita on 
health 
care. 
The 
American 
people, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, believe that health 
care is a human right. We’re 
on a campus here, the beautiful 
campus of the University of 
Michigan, and I think people all 
across this country understand 
that our young people are 
entitled 
to 
a 
good 
quality 
education without having to 
go deeply into debt. And they 
support the idea of making 
public colleges and universities 
tuition-free and canceling all 
student debt through a modest 

tax on Wall Street speculation. 
And lastly, there is a growing 
understanding 
that 
climate 
change is an existential threat. 
Our country and the world, 
people want us to deal with it. 
So to answer your question, 
the way you bring bipartisan 
support together is by talking 
about the issues that impact the 
vast majority of the people who 
are working people.
TMD: 
You’ve 
made 
the 
argument that increasing voter 
turnout — particularly among 
young people — can create a 
new electorate, one that will 

vote for progressive change. 
But, in states like Virginia 
where voter turnout was up 
on Super Tuesday, former Vice 
President Joe Biden still won a 
commanding lead. What does 
it mean for your campaign that 
increased voter turnout didn’t 
translate to more support for 
the progressive candidate?
Sanders: 
That’s 
a 
good 
question. 
In 
Virginia, 
the 
turnout went way up. We haven’t 
analyzed, to be honest with you, 
all of the voter turnout data.

We often cross paths but do 
not speak I do not know him, but 
understand my brother is not my 
enemy I do not know of his pain, but 
simply know that it exists So we nod 
We understand that no one cares 
for your two cents, when they look 
through you as if you missin’ two-
fifths 
Understand that our streets will 
poor out two more fifths for our sons 
and daughters today, 
But we didn’t put these liquor 
stores here 
Didn’t flood this cities gates with 
snow But we nod to the “War on 

Drugs” 
When we nod, we raddle 400 
years of slavery and those pictures 
didn’t make it to your Whitehouse 
They didn’t quite make it to your 
textbooks So “eighth grade history 
teacher” please tell me more about 
Christopher Columbus but never

Please tell me more of Martin 
Luther King and who else I am 
“allowed” to celebrate but never 
speak of Malcolm-X 
Of the Black Panthers 
Don’t you know that they are

We nod to the “War on Terror” 
We nod because some days smiling 
is unbearable when the corner of 
your lip is stitched to borrowed 

cheekbones of unknown ancestors, 
I do not know where I am from 
But still nod to a last name birthed 
on a plantation so 
Often 
introductions 
taste 
of 
cottonmouth and strange fruit 
They have picket fenced our 
tounges so let us take this moment of 
silence 
To honor the absence of gunshot 
anthems and allow our eyes to do 
the talking Turn our pupils into 
pupils and teach them the value of 
a proper hello The delivery of a firm 
handshake And the peace offering of 
a smile 
Which gives the prelude to the 
deepest conversation 
We never had.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan in Color
Monday, March 9, 2020 — 3A

In the wake of the video of the 
student government president 
making anti-Palestinian, anti-
Arab 
comments, 
I’ve 
been 
thinking a lot about what it 
means to be Palestinian; both on 
this campus and in the broader 
world. Sometimes, I find myself 
envying the certainty I had in 
my identity as a child. Even 
before I knew about words such 
as “apartheid” or could fathom 
ideas like “two state solution”, 
there was an emanant longing 
my father radiated when he 
would sit on the patio with a glass 
of marimeyah (a chillingly warm 
mint tea native to Palestine). My 
parents were refugees: They did 
not leave their country by choice. 
They never let us forget that.
In the wake of the Holocaust, 
the Jewish people were looking 
for a state. They found hope for 
a national homeland in this strip 
of land in the Middle East and 
began to organize a movement 
to 
establish 
this 
homeland 
there around the slogan, “a land 

without a people for a people 
without a land.” There was a small 
problem with this; Palestine 
most certainly was not a land 
without a people. My family, and 
other Palestinian families, had 
been living there for generations. 
Partially because their way of 
life revolved around farming and 
partially due to Jerusalem being a 
religious hub, they had extremely 
strong connections to the land. 
Apparently, a native population 
was just a small setback for a 
huge comeback because in 1948, 
700,000 
Palestinians 
were 
forcibly 
expelled 
from 
their 
homes. Both them and their 
descendents are actively denied 
the right to return. 
There’s a word people in 
the diaspora use to describe 
the displacement: ghourba. It 
roughly translates to a feeling of 
being foriegn no matter where 
you are. I didn’t understand this 
as much until I was older, and I 
interacted with non-Arabs. Being 
asked “where you’re from” is 

already a stressor for most first-
generation immigrants but every 
time that question was directed 
at me, I felt like I lost a part of 
my subjectivity. As soon as I 
confessed to being Palestinian, 
I turned into either just another 
demographic 
threat 
or 
a 
projection of the conflict. I didn’t 
have the privilege of casually 
talking about my homeland. 
Reading a poem which affirmed 
my 
right 
to 
be 
Palestinian 
was enough to almost get me 
suspended my sophomore year 
of high school because a school 
board member took issue with 
me saying the P-word at a school 
event on school property. My 
mother began to teach me to 
cultivate silence; that it would 
be better to hold my story close 
to my chest where I wouldn’t 
be punished for it until I found 

places where it was safe to 
speak.
Michigan was supposed to be 
one of those places. I remember 
coming onto this campus and 
being excited to talk about 
Palestine as much as I wanted. 
The statement that Schlissel 
released during my first month 
condemning academic boycott 
of Israel wasn’t a great omen, but 
I remained hopeful. I needed to 
remain hopeful.
As a wide-eyed, freshman, 
student 
government 
intern, 
I decided a Central Student 
Government executive meeting 
between 
the 
interns 
and 
executive would be the perfect 
place to test this theory. After 
all, CSG was meant to represent 
ALL the students of University 
of Michigan, and with a sizeable 
Arab and Palestinian population, 
I assumed CSG spaces must 
be at-odds with the broader 
mentalities the University held. 
The icebreaker question was 
“what is your favorite food?” 
When the circle made its way 
around to me, I responded with, 

“I’m Palestinian so my favorite 
foods are words that mean 
nothing to y’all.”
The hush which fell over the 
room was ghastly saved for the 
quiet chuckling of my Muslim 
friend on exec that served to 
inform me I had fucked up. You 
would think I said my favorite 
food was a Trump re-election. 
Later, I was told that if I wanted 
to talk about Palestine, the 
student government was not the 
place for me. Because it was too 
divisive of an issue; my right to 
exist and occupy space was too 
divisive of an issue. Moreover, 
what did I have to gain? This 
administration (besides being 
at best passive and at worst 
pro-displacement) 
was 
great! 
We weren’t going to see better 
options than this, so couldn’t 
I just be okay with this minor 
character flaw?
I see this constantly. As 
Palestinians, we are demanded 
to accept a baseline amount 
of violence. We shoulder the 
burden 
of 
“creating 
peace” 
with a state which abuses our 
human rights, to such a degree 
that it is widely considered 
genocide by Palestinians and 
allies. We’ve been socialized 
out of mainstream U.S. society 

to protect the comfort of the 
Zionists, 
and 
our 
existence 
comes almost as an after-thought 
for most people. I think about 
this the most with the upcoming 
election, 
where 
I 
will 
be 
expected to show up and vote for 
a candidate who advocates for my 
ethnic cleansing (albeit, maybe 
in different packaging) because 
our lives are inconsequential 
compared to the larger concerns 
of society. It just begs the 
question of why Palestinian lives 
are the issue so many of us are 
willing to compromise on?
I want better for my people. 
I want us to have permission 
to narrate our stories. I want 
to be able to confidently write 
about the country I am from 
without consideration of any 
reaction from audiences other 
than boredom. I want to be able 
to walk into an interview and 
say, “I’m Palestinian” with my 
whole chest and not have to 
worry if something as simple as 
saying where I’m from will cost 
me a job. I want to be more than 
a mantra or a scapegoat. I want 
to be heard. I want to be able to 
have faith in something again. I 
don’t want to be swept under the 
rug. I want the certainty I had as 
a child. I want to feel safe.

“As Indian women, we must 
learn to love him in spite of 
him. He’s my son babu, I love 
him because I know no one 
else has,” my mother sighed in 
exasperation.
My 
brother 
stood 
doe 
eyed at the feet of my father, 
innocent in his mission to 
conquer parental affection. 
His presence was drowned out 
by my father’s shadow. They 
sat together at the kitchen 
table, 
my 
brother’s 
feet 
dangling from his chair, my 

father’s planted. My mother 
readied both hands for the 
men of the family. Armed, she 
stood, chai for my father, milk 
for my brother. My brother 
watched 
adoringly 
as 
my 
father reached for his cup. 
I watched curiously as my 
mother flinched at his reach. 
When my mother describes 
my 
brother’s 
birth, 
she 
describes him as someone who 
was born crying, immediately 
in contention with leaving 
home and entering the world. 
I am sorry our father taught 
you to be afraid of your own 
tears. 
As my brother grew, his 
presence was now noticeable 
to my mother, and equally 
encroaching to my father. 
Our 
dad 
defended 
his 

dominance well. My father’s 
bruised knuckles continued 
to reach for his cup. My 
brother, now with an intuitive 
understanding, 
sensed 
my 
mother’s fear. 
Now, my brother faces the 
same choice, with anger fierce 
enough to clasp a cup, and 
gentleness tender enough to 
serve chai.
In my father’s absence, he 
takes his place at the table. 
He has grown into my father’s 
shadow. He has made his 
choice. Now, I face a choice, 
too. Often, I wonder, if I do not 
love me, who else will? I hope 
my brother can forgive me. I 
am still learning how to love 
you in spite of you.

n the four years since the 
2016 election, calls for the 
dissolution of the Electoral 
College have become widespread, 
and ahead of the 2020 election, 
the calls seem even louder. 
However, the Electoral College 
should remain, both to protect the 
minority political opinions against 
a tyranny of the majority and to 
preserve our union. The founders 
understood 
with 
unparalleled 
clarity 
the 
importance 
of 
structural parallelism, and they 
wrote beautifully in defense of the 
Electoral College and its benefits 
in “The Federalist Papers.” Calling 
to dismantle the Electoral College 
in the name of “one person, one 
vote” is, by logical extension, 
calling also for the dismantling of 
our federal republic.
The 
Federalist 
Papers 
are 
perhaps the greatest political 
commentary 
published 
in 
American 
history. 
They’re 
a 
collection of 85 essays written 
in 1788 by Alexander Hamilton, 
James Madison and John Jay – 
under the pseudonym Publius – 
to persuade the American people 
to ratify the Constitution. Three 
specific essays illuminate the 
benefits checks and balances offer, 
the virtues a federalist system 
protects and how the Electoral 
College functions: No. 10, No. 51 
and No. 68, respectively.
Before addressing the issue 
of dismantling the Electoral 
College, 
it’s 
imperative 
to 
understand 
its 
fundamental 
structure and operation. First, 
in every state, each party on the 
ballot chooses people to serve 
collectively as a slate of electors, 
all pledged to vote for a particular 
candidate. Critically, the number 
of electors per state is identical 
to the number of United States 
representatives 
and 
senators 
from that state. In November, 
when voters at the polls indicate 
their choice for the general 
election, the vote doesn’t go to 
the candidate directly, but rather 
to the slate of electors previously 
chosen by the candidate’s party. 
In 
December, 
the 
electors 
belonging to whichever party 
wins the state’s popular vote cast 
their votes for president and vice 
president. 
As seen in 2016 – as well as 
2000, 1888, and 1876 – it is possible 
for a candidate to win a solid 
majority of electoral votes and yet 
lose the popular vote nationwide. 
Since 1824, most states adopted 
a 
“winner-take-all” 
electoral 
vote system, with only Maine 
and Nebraska maintaining a 
proportional delegation today. 
Critics argue that this system, by 
which the people indirectly elect 
the president and vice president, 
doesn’t honor the democratic 
notion of “one person, one vote,” 
and places more weight on votes 
in smaller states. This argument 
is 
easily 
understandable 
yet 
fatefully ill-conceived.

Madison wrote famously in 
Federalist No. 10 about the role 
of “factions” in a federal republic: 
“The influence of factious leaders 
may kindle a flame within 
their particular States, but will 
be unable to spread a general 
conflagration through the other 
States.” Here, Madison defends 
the 
Constitution’s 
federalist 
system for its resistance to the 
rise of powerful factions. It is 
important to clarify the meaning 
of “faction,” and Madison does 
so, writing that “by a faction, I 
understand a number of citizens, 
whether amounting to a majority 
or a minority of the whole, who 
are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of 
interest.” The Electoral College 
affords 
the 
same 
protection 
against 
a 
powerful 
faction, 
that is likely geographically or 
socioeconomically concentrated, 
by leveraging federalist principles 
identical to those so clearly 
outlined in the Constitution. 
A large faction that gains over 
90 percent popularity in the 
nine 
most 
populous 
states 
would capture a majority of the 
American population. In a direct 
democracy, 
such 
a 
situation 
would transform the U.S. and 
endanger minority liberties at the 
whim of the majority.

However, the protection of 
the Electoral College extends 
further. It is easy to imagine 
a 
benevolent 
faction 
that 
constitutes a minority – groups 
united by occupation, ethnicity, 
religion, etc. In such an instance, 
federalism, and by extension the 
Electoral College, preserves their 
liberty. For example, consider 
Utah, where the majority of 
residents are Mormon. Within 
Utah, the popular vote is used 
in state elections, which means 
that state officials and legislation 
likely reflect the values of the 
voters, and each state’s individual 
rights allow for laws to reflect 
those values. For nominating 
the president and vice president 
in 
federal 
elections, 
Utah 
contributes six electoral votes. 
If the popular vote were used 
nationwide in nominating the 
president, who then influences 
legislation applied to every state, 
it’s understandable how minority 
groups could easily be stifled. 
Next comes the troubling 
phrase “one person, one vote.” 
Nowhere in the Constitution 

does this notion appear regarding 
national voting. The United States 
is not a direct democracy. It never 
has been. We live in a federal 
republic, a Union of States. As 
such, federal representation is 
determined on a state level – think 
of Congress. A state’s Electoral 
College 
representation 
is 
identical to its total Congressional 
representation. Objecting to the 
Electoral College on the grounds 
it violates this notion logically 
entails 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
structure of Congress. The same 
degree of “inequality” in vote-
weight found in the Electoral 
College exists in Congressional 
representation. 
Further, 
the 
only difference between state 
representation in the House and 
in the Electoral College is the 
addition of two votes to account 
for Senate seats and winner-take-
all systems. Thus, taking aim 
at the Electoral College for its 
“unfairness” is only truly taking 
issue with Senate representation. 
As adamant as people may be to 
dissolve the Electoral College, 
the argument doesn’t incorporate 
due diligence and proponents 
have seemingly looked no further 
than 
the 
immediate 
desired 
effects. I certainly don’t hear 
these critics calling for the end of 
our bicameral legislature. 
Federalism is at the core of 
the U.S. and is the foundation 
upon which Abraham Lincoln’s 
noble aspirations to “form a 
more perfect Union” reside. 
States existed long before their 
union under the Constitution 
in 1789, and before even the 
Declaration of Independence. 
We embraced federalism to 
become this union of states and 
wrote it so in the Constitution. 
The Electoral College, then, 
is not an arcane, needlessly 
controversial 
institution; 
rather, it is federalism applied 
once 
more. 
To 
dissolve 
the 
Electoral 
College 
is 
to 
invalidate 
the 
goals 
of 
federalism and such an act 
might have great repercussions, 
capable of dramatically altering 
our governmental landscape 
into something objectively less 
desirable. The Electoral College 
serves as an equalizer in the 
voting process like the Senate 
is to the legislature, protecting 
the populace from a tyranny of 
the majority, or a president’s 
desires run rampant.
The 
founders 
understood 
human nature and the nature 
of government with startling 
acuity. The Federalist Papers are 
an expression of that knowledge 
and a defense of the Constitution. 
The Electoral College is one of 
many inheritors of their genius, 
but it embodies all that the 
founders fought to preserve. Its 
dissolution would be a tragedy.

A case for the electoral college

hen 
classes 
ended 
Friday, University of 
Michigan 
students 
hopped in cars and caught planes to 
their Spring Break destinations. Our 
travels guzzled jet fuel and gasoline, 
which feels somewhat contrary 
to the environmentally mindful 
views of the majority of the student 
body. Many of us feel that climate 
change and carbon emissions are 
the greatest threat of our time and 
necessitate immediate major action, 
but if you think your choice to emit 
carbon while traveling makes you 
hypocritical, it’s actually these 
feelings of guilt that are letting the 
big oil and gas industry win. 
Big corporations that are massive 
emitters of carbon want you to 
believe that climate change is the 
fault of the individual. If it is the 
general public’s fault for over-
consuming and only a change in our 
behaviors can save the world, then 
we reduce the responsibility big 
corporations must take. The truth is 
that 100 companies are responsible 
for over 70 percent of global human-
caused emissions since 1988. These 
companies have made huge profits 
while destroying our planet yet 
would love for you to believe it’s your 
personal actions that are causing 
the climate crisis. BP even released 
its own Carbon Footprint calculator, 
helping further the belief that it is 
our personal actions that will be the 
way to cutting carbon emissions.
Transportation is the main 
source of carbon emissions for 
Americans. Carpooling and biking 
are great ways to reduce your 
carbon footprint, but the minute 
you step on a plane, your footprint 
skyrockets. A roundtrip flight from 
New York to San Francisco warms 

the planet with about two or three 
tons of carbon per person. The 
average American causes about 
19 tons of carbon emissions a year, 
meaning about 13 percent of a year’s 
worth of carbon would be emitted 
in just one trip. That is a hard pill to 
swallow if you’re flying somewhere 
far for a quick spring break.
Is the expansion of travel 
to 
blame 
for 
our 
carbon 
overuse? 
Many 
tourist 
sites 
are overpopulated. People are 
traveling more and further than 
they ever have. The relationship 
and experience we have with 
tourism is so far away from that of 
our parents’ generation and even 
further from our grandparents’. 
Though 
the 
degradation 
of 
landmarks and our experience of 
them from overcrowding is tragic, 
this is an issue of poor government 
and 
institutional 
management, 
not one that is solely the fault of 
travelers.
Travel expands our worldviews. 
The exchange of knowledge and 
the experiences gained through 
travel have an unquantifiable 
benefit not only to society, but to 
individuals. Far-reaching travel 
is still financially inaccessible to 
the vast majority of people in the 
world, but it is also more accessible 
to the general public than ever 
before, making it more than for 
solely the wealthy elite. To shame 
people for travel now is similar to 
shaming developing countries for 
becoming more industrial. Just as 
the United States had its industrial 
revolution before carbon-limiting 
agreements came to be, the über-
elite and wealthy had their time 
to travel widely before the middle 
class got their chance.

That 
being 
said, 
excessive 
travel should be limited as much 
as possible and especially travel 
done in private aircrafts. There is 
no reason for a luxury that does so 
much harm, and it is irresponsible 
to use jet fuel to fly a plane with only 
a handful of people inside. Students 
on a Spring Break trip, however, 
can 
still 
consider 
themselves 
environmentalists while engaging 
in the occasional environmentally 
harmful 
activity. 
Other 
environmentally friendly practices 
we engage in while traveling are not 
canceled out due to the fact we used 
jet fuel to get there. 

Extreme 
personal 

responsibility as a requirement 
to environmentalism ostracizes 
those who would otherwise be 
willing to support the movement. 
It is not necessary to cut out red 
meat, stop buying new clothes 
and stop traveling to be a good 
environmentalist (though all of 
those actions are a great way to 
help the planet). We can contribute 
to the environmental movement in 
the way that we see fit and should 
not be shamed, or shame others, for 
doing so at our own level.
There is a balance between 
taking personal responsibility and 
remembering 
that 
corporations 
have a major fault in climate change. 
Both lifestyle change and major 
political change is necessary to 
combat the climate crisis. With that 
in mind, college students should be 
able to explore and travel during 
their Spring Break without guilt 
and remain credible advocates for 
the climate.

The hypocrisy of Major League Baseball

O

ver the past few years, 
the Houston Astros 
have been a team full 
of cheaters. For three years, the 
team management used cameras 
to record signs from the opposing 
teams’ pitchers and shared them 
with their players, a prohibited 
move known as sign-stealing. 
This behavior continued into the 
postseason and the Astros won 
the World Series in 2017 while 
continuing to use these methods. 
The team tried to address the 
issue in a press conference from 
hell. The team’s owner, Jim Crane, 
apologized with all the sincerity of 
a 6-year-old caught with his hand 
in a cookie jar. Crane claimed 
during the same press conference 
both that he didn’t know if the 
sign-stealing impacted the game 
and also the sign-stealing didn’t 
impact the game. Crane is a lot 
of things, but he isn’t this stupid., 
though his comments at the 
conference suggest that he feels 
the average viewer is. Why would 
a team cheat? To win, obviously. 
And if they do cheat, it clearly will 
impact the game.
Major 
League 
Baseball 
finished 
investigating 
the 
case in January 2020 and 
decided to punish the team. 
The punishment included a 
$5-million fine and a loss of 
four draft picks, as well as the 
suspension of team executive 
Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. 
Hinch for the 2020 season. 
Crane later fired both Luhnow 
and Hinch. However, not a single 
player was fined or suspended 
despite the fact that the players 
knew about the scheme and 
actively participated in it.

This 
is 
bizarre 
when 
considering the case of Pete 
Rose. Rose is the all-time hits 
leader in MLB and is, by any fair 
measure, one of the greatest to 
ever play the game. Rose played 
for the Cincinnati Reds from 1963 
to 1978 and then managed the 
team from 1984 to 1986. During 
his time as manager, he gambled 
on the Reds to win. He was 
later banned from the game and 
thus the Hall of Fame when his 
betting became known to MLB 
leadership. In 2015, Rose applied 
for reinstatement to the League, 
which 
MLB 
Commissioner 
Robert Manfred declined the 
request on the grounds that Rose 
presented a risk “to the integrity 
of our sport.”
Whether or not Rose betting 
on his team was ethical is not the 
point, but it is laughable to argue 
that Rose’s behavior is deserving 
of a ban while that of the Astros 
is deserving of a slap on the wrist. 
For some reason, one of these 
instances threatened the integrity 
of the game and the other didn’t. 
And finesse and draft picks are no 
punishment at all. 
While cheating over the past 
three years, the Astros have 
won the American League West 
Division title every year, the 
American League Championship 
Series two years out of three and 
the World Series once. Though it 
is impossible to prove they would 
have lost without the assistance, 
they clearly thought they needed 
it to win. Manfred suggesting this 
didn’t violate the integrity of the 
game is incredible and there’s no 
way even he believes the nonsense 
he’s hawking. Again, if people 

cheat, they do it to win and that 
will violate the integrity of the 
sport in and of itself.
In addition, Manfred suggested 
that a lack of contrition on the part 
of Rose was part of the reason for 
Rose’s continued suspension. How 
does this square with the Astros’ 
Justin Verlander, who currently 
pitches for the Astros, had no 
problem sharing his opinions on 
how MLB players want a “clean 
game” after Dee Gordon, then 
a player for the Miami Marlins, 
was busted using performance-
enhancing drugs (PEDs). Yet for 
some reason, the self-appointed 
czar of cleanliness was unable 
to 
significantly 
grapple 
with 
the Astros’ obvious cheating. 
Verlander claims to have been 
opposed to the sign-stealing, 
yet he was unwilling to put his 
words into action because talk is 
cheap. His complete hypocrisy 
about “clean games” suggests the 
only thing he has ever said that is 
worth listening to was “I do” to 
Kate Upton, a woman far more 
successful than him (who didn’t 
cheat to get where she is).
Rose was punished because 
they violated the game. They were 
meant to act with integrity and 
they didn’t. However, integrity 
is a funny thing because either 
it matters or it doesn’t. There 
cannot be one set of rules for 
Rose and another for the team 
that cheated their way to the top. 
Since Commissioner Manfred has 
decided that the Astros’ behavior is 
acceptable, there is no reason Rose 
should be treated any differently.

Monday, March 9, 2020 — 5A

There are a select few who 
can claim to have as much of 
an impact on electronic music 
in the 21st century as Caribou, 
also known as Dan Snaith. In 
the 2000s, he expanded upon 
the 
plunderphonics 
of 
DJ 
Shadow’s 
Endtroducing 
with 
Up In Flames and flirted with 
a psychedelic Laurel Canyon 
sound on Andorra. In the 2010s, 
he ventured into dancehall on 
Swim and Our Love. Throughout 
his career, whether as Montreal 
or Caribou, he has pushed 
electronic music towards the 
sublime. Similarly to Four Tet, 
Caribou tends to explore the idea 
of vibrance through his music. 
As a result, color and texture 
have become domineering tools 
in Caribou’s arsenal. He will 
often let layers of sound invade 
the mix until the music blends 
into one element. Now, entering 
the 
new 
decade, 
it 
seems 
Caribou is opting for a more 
reserved approach, resulting in 
his most contemplative album 
yet: Suddenly.
He appears to be emulating 
several artists on the record, 
including 
Floating 
Points, 
whose style has always favored 
a more introspective listening 
experience. 
Suddenly 
finds 
Snaith 
embracing 
soft 
and 
isolated synth tones alongside 
the 
pop-inspired 
dancehall 
he’s so familiar with — synth 

tones that sound eerily similar 
to the tones on Floating Points’ 
last record. Another influence 
is Against All Logic (Nicolas 
Jaar), whose 2012-2017 project 
reinvigorated house, capturing 
more 
mainstream 
listeners. 
Both 
albums 
exhibit 
very 
in-your-face type sample work. 
This type of plunderphonics 
is new for Caribou. Before, his 

use of samples was always as a 
means to fill the background 
with some color; now, it’s an 
integral player in most of the 
songs on Suddenly. The vocal 
samples in particular on tracks 
like “Sunny’s Time” and “New 
Jade” demonstrate an effort on 
the part of Snaith to find more 
esoteric ways of developing a 
song. 
Song development in general 
is much different here than on 
previous records. Suddenly feels 
more definitive in its direction. 
The music doesn’t wander off 
because it doesn’t have the time. 
Snaith finds virtue in brevity 

with an average track length 
of less than four minutes. The 
only song that goes against 
this trend is the last one which, 
unsurprisingly, is the longest. As 
a result, this structural option 
combined with the occasional 
trap beat makes this feel like 
Caribou’s 
most 
conservative 
release. Fortunately, it appears 
to be intentional, as it leaves 
room for Snaith to express more 
lyrically than he ever has in the 
past.
Snaith makes it pretty clear 
that Suddenly is about emotional 
clarity. Every track details a 
certain moment of transparency 
where he is able to let out the 
feelings he has kept confined. 
His work has always been 
relatively romantic but typically 
this was presented through 
the music. Now, it’s entirely 
found in his words. He talks 
of heartbreak and the fear of 
loss. “You and I” specifically 
addresses the loss of his brother-
in-law, and how such an event 
can empty someone. He speaks 
of each aspect with astounding 
palpability. 
Perhaps the only issue with 
Suddenly is that it’s a bit top-
heavy. All of the best and most 
inventive tracks were put on 
the first half, leaving the more 
subdued songs to close out 
the project. This leaves the 
album feeling unbalanced. The 
solution would be as easy as a 
simple reordering. Regardless, 
Caribou has put out a strikingly 
personal effort on Suddenly that 
leaves the listener enlightened 
and ready to move forward.

‘Suddenly’ is Caribou’s 
most meditative release

ALBUM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

With the current political 
climate 
as 
terrible 
and 
terrifying as it is, the last thing 
you may want to do is get up 
and dance. But, according to 
Professor Michael Gould, that 
is actually the first thing you 
should do.
The 
2020 
“Dance 
for 
Democracy” is an evening 
at the UMMA of live music, 
dancing 
and 
democratic 
engagement. 
On 
Tuesday, 
Mar. 10, three bands — E. 
Reid with Kultur Grenade (for 
which Gould is the drummer), 
local band The Kelseys and 
funk 
band 
Sabbatical 
Bob 
— will perform, while event 
organizers 
help 
attendees 
become more democratically 
engaged. The event is free 
and open to all U-M students, 
with a capacity of 300 people, 
no matter what their political 
ideals are.
Gould 
got 
the 
idea 
when frustration from the 
disappointing 
news 
cycle 
threatened to overtake him. 
“The only thing at that 
moment that popped into my 
mind was locking myself in a 
room and dancing my ass off 
until exhaustion,” Gould wrote 
in an email interview with The 
Daily. “What a funny thought 
— so, I decided to act upon this 
and do something positive.”
This event is meant to 

bring 
together 
students 
from all across the political 
spectrum. Everyone is feeling 
the 
frustration, 
no 
matter 
their political ideals. But that 
doesn’t mean we can’t all dance 
together and try to understand 
each other’s opinions. 
“My thought was let’s bring 
everyone together in a large 
venue — blue, red, purple ... to 
enjoy the democratic process 

without the divisiveness that 
has raged across the US,” 
Gould wrote.
The 
event 
will 
strongly 
emphasize voting. There will 
be tables with information 
specific to voting to ensure a 
large voting turnout among 
college students. 
“I think everyone’s voice 
and vote matters and it is 
extremely 
important 
that 
college aged students get out 
and vote — we need your input 
on how you want the future of 
our country to be run,” Gould 

wrote.
Gould also talked about 
the potential of the event to 
facilitate dialogue across the 
political spectrum.
“My hope is that everyone 
gets out on the dance floor — 
builds up a good sweat and 
then takes a break and talks 
about their views in a civilized 
manner,” Gould wrote. “It is 
hard to be angry after dancing 
your ass off to great music — 
music is one of the greatest 
ways to bring people together 
… so come out and express 
yourself in motion and then 
talk in the tabling section or 
the periphery of the event. 
Give the opposing view a 
chance and a hug or high five 
or fist bump (hey, and wash 
your hands).”
No 
matter 
how 
you’re 
feeling about the presidential 
candidates, Gould and those 
with “Dance for Democracy” 
want 
to 
emphasize 
the 
importance of voicing your 
opinions and allowing others 
to voice theirs. Part of what 
keeps our democracy intact is 
freedom to have discussions 
like this, and if they can be 
done with dancing, then even 
better.
“Even if you feel discouraged 
about the political process, shy 
about dancing, scared about 
what is going to happen with 
the upcoming election — come 
on out and talk to other people 
who most likely feel the same — 
and in the process, hear some 
great music that will hopefully 
get you moving,” Gould wrote.

Horror movies, in general, 
are not my favorite things in the 
world. I got nightmares simply 
from reading the synopsis of 
“Us,” and had I known what 
“Get Out” was about, I would 
not have agreed to see it with my 
friends. Obviously, Jordan Peele 
isn’t the only person making 
horror movies, but of the ones 
I’m interested in seeing, his 
movies rank the highest. On 
top of their plots, however, they 
have another thing in common: 
their release dates. “Us” aired in 
theaters on Mar. 22 last year and 
“Get Out” was released on Feb. 
24, 2017. Both are extremely 
innocuous dates, with nothing 
all that culturally important 
happening. 
Maybe 
midterms 
at U-M, but at that point in the 
semester, we could all use a 
good scare that doesn’t come 
from a Canvas page. 
The 
idea 
behind 
movie 
release dates is classic. So 
classic, in fact, that several of 
my college classes have used 
it as an example to discuss 
what’s known as the prisoner’s 
dilemma. In essence, studios are 
trying to avoid opening certain 
movies on certain days in order 
to gain the biggest profit. It’s a 
concept that’s easy enough to 
understand and, traditionally, 
may also result in releases on 
certain dates, like Thanksgiving 
or Christmas, to boost opening 

day profits. Again, a totally 
expected thing to do. Except for 
the fact that, for some reason, 
various production studios have 
decided to release horror movies 
on holidays that, quite honestly, 
don’t need horror movies. 
This 
past 
December, 
Universal 
Pictures 
released 
“Black 
Christmas,” 
a 
film 

centered around a group of 
sorority girls trying to avoid 
being murdered on their empty 
campus 
during 
the 
holiday 
season. 
Though 
it 
wasn’t 
released on Dec. 25, its holiday 
season ad campaign put a serious 
damper on the red-and-white 
Macy’s doorbuster ads any sane 

person would prefer. That said, 
not all Christmas movies have 
the happy-go-lucky bad acting 
of the Hallmark variety — “The 
Nightmare Before Christmas” 
is a classic, though I personally 
have never seen it because Jack 
Skellington gives me the creeps. 
What “The Nightmare Before 
Christmas” proves, however, is 
that the key to a good Christmas 
horror movie is to maintain the 
essence of the holiday season. 
“Black Christmas” is mired in 
clichés; sorority girls alone on 
campus being attacked by a 
mysterious man has been done 
in more movies than I can count. 
An animated skeleton that finds 
the true meaning of Christmas? 
Now there’s an original idea. 
Not 
all 
seasonal 
horror 
is 
created 
equal, 
however. 
Valentine’s 
Day, 
as 
commercialized a holiday as you 
can get, was made for horror 
movies. While I would rather 
watch Taylor Swift and Taylor 
Lautner exchange sloppy teen 
kisses and a large white teddy 
bear in “Valentine’s Day” over 
and over, I can understand the 
appeal of sitting through a scary 
movie with your significant 
other. They give people the 
excuse to cuddle up and hold 
hands, if only because they’re 
scared. Absolutely genius, truly. 
And it makes sense, then, that 
when I googled “Valentine’s day 
horror movies,” there were at 
least six options to choose from. 
It’s honestly impressive the way 
studios and the floral industry 
capitalize on our constant need 

to feel close to someone. 
Even July 4 isn’t safe — 
“Midsommar” was released this 
past summer on July 3, and the 
whole third season of “Stranger 
Things” was released on the 
fourth. 
“Midsommar” 
being 
released during the summer 
holiday is forgivable, mostly 
because July 4 really shouldn’t 
be a holiday anyway. At this 
point, it’s just an excuse for 
Americans to blow things up 
and drink, but that’s not really 
relevant. 
What 
is 
relevant, 
however, is the fact that Florence 
Pugh gave us a reason to watch 
her frolic with an eerie band of 
people wearing flower crowns. 
And though “Stranger Things” 
isn’t a film, with the binging 
culture that Netflix has created, 
watching season three all the 
way through is almost the same 
as watching a horror movie, but 
with more opportunities to go 
get more popcorn, or even a tan.
The 
one 
horror 
movie 
holiday release date that I 

can’t 
understand, 
however, 
is Mother’s Day. There is no 
reason that people should be 

going to the movies on Mother’s 
Day, let alone to see a horror 
movie. Maybe your mom is 

into feeling frightened, which 
is fine, but when I’m watching 
a sewing tutorial and have to 
mute my computer and watch 
a trailer through my fingers 
for a horror movie not even 
released on Mother’s Day, but 
on Mother’s Day weekend, I 
have some questions for the 
marketing 
department. 
Let’s 
just discuss the date itself, not 
even its connotations — how 
many people actually know 
when Mother’s Day is without 
googling it? I’m not an awful 
daughter; when May comes 
around, I will figure it out and 
set my Google Calendar to 
remind me the day before, but 
as a consumer I want to be told a 
concrete date. What I don’t need 
is a scary man’s voice telling 
me, three months in advance, 
that this Mother’s Day I should 
be ready to run from Sarah 
Paulson’s 
newest 
character, 
when I don’t really even know if 
Mother’s Day is on a Saturday or 
a Sunday.

News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Sanders: My impression is that 
older people voted in significantly 
higher numbers, their percentages 
went way up. More younger people 
did vote, but nowhere near the 
level of increase of older people. 
But here is the challenge that we 
face. Younger people are in fact the 
most progressive young generation 
in the history of this country, that’s 
your generation. The problem is 
that it has historically been very 
hard to get young people to vote in 
large numbers. We’re making some 
progress. 2018 was a good example 
where a lot more younger people 
voted than four years previous to 
that. I think you’re going to see the 
same thing now. But historically it 
has been hard, and that’s why we’re 
here on the campus, that’s why 
we visit many campuses: to make 
it clear to young people that in a 
democracy they have an obligation 
to participate, that it’s not good 
enough to moan and groan about 
all the concerns you have, you’ve 
got to get involved and stand up 
for what you believe in, and that 
means participating in the political 
progress. 
TMD: Student loans are a very 
important issue for many people 
here at the University of Michigan 
and universities across the country. 
What do you say to your opponents 

who believe that canceling student 
loan debt is a handout? 
Sanders: Well, what I say is if 
Trump could give a trillion dollars 
in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and 
large multinational corporations, 
if Congress 12 years ago could bail 
out the crooks on Wall Street who 
destroyed our economy through a 
Wall Street bailout — what do you 
call those things? Those things 
are handouts, but handouts that 
are going to the very rich and 
the powerful. I think that young 
people who have done the right 
thing, they’re trying to get a decent 
education, what we’re finding is that 
they’re struggling very hard to buy 
a home, to buy a car, to get married, 
to have kids. I think it is totally 
appropriate through a modest tax 
on Wall Street speculation to raise 
enough money which will make 
public colleges and universities like 
the University of Michigan tuition-
free and at the same time cancel all 
student debt. So in other words, 12 
years ago we bailed out big time the 
people on Wall Street who nearly 
destroyed the economy. I think 
through a modest tax on Wall Street 
speculation, they can help us help 
the younger generation. 
TMD: And now we have more of 
a fun question: Have you seen any 
of the memes about yourself? If so, 
what’s your favorite?
Sanders: No. Well, I probably 
have, there’s so much stuff out there. 
Literally I have a hard time keeping 
up with it.

Yosef 
Gross, 
no relation to Amanda Gross, 
commented on Gore’s political 
legacy and the impact of his 
environmental policies on the 
upcoming election. 
“I think he has the potential 
to be a really good choice as the 
commencement speaker because 
his own political experience is 
so relevant to what’s happening 
this political cycle,” Gross said. 
“When I think about Gore 
conceding the presidency to 
Bush in 2000 to make sure that 
the country could move forward, 
even though he believed that 
the election had been stolen 
from him, I can’t help but notice 
the contrast with our current 
president, who I believe would 
never do the same.

COMMENCEMENT 
From Page 6A

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
2019 
Central 
Student Government voter 
turnout 
ranked 
fourth 
highest 
across 
Big 
Ten 
schools, according to The 
Michigan 
Daily’s 
analysis 
of voting trends in student 
government elections. 
The Daily analyzed Winter 
2019 
— 
the 
most 
recent 
executive ticket election — 
data for 13 of the Big Ten 
schools. The University of 
Illinois student government 
was not included because 
voting data could not be 
obtained. 
On 
the 
high 
end 
for 
the 
Winter 
2019 
student 
government elections, 16.4 
percent 
of 
University 
of 
Nebraska 
undergraduates 
voted. 
The 
lowest 
voter 
turnout 
rate 
was 
at 
Rutgers 
University-New 
Brunswick, where 2 percent 
of 
undergraduate 
students 
voted. 
From 2015 to 2017, voter 
turnout for CSG elections fell 
steadily from 20.1 percent 
to 17.9 percent but jumped 
to 23.9 percent in 2018. In 
2019, the figure declined to 
approximately 11.9 percent.
Based 
on 
this 
data, 
if 
rankings were based on the 
2018 
election 
as 
opposed 
to the 2019 election, the 
CSG voter turnout would 
have 
been 
approximately 
50 percent more than the 
next highest school. Instead, 

because of the double-digit 
drop, it was fourth. 
As 
deputy 
elections 
director during the Winter 
2019 election and elections 
director for the Fall 2019 
election, Law student Austin 
Del Priore administered and 
advertised the elections. He 
said he and his team handed 
out flyers on the Diag and 
emailed the student body to 
encourage students to vote.
Del Priore attributed last 
year’s voter turnout to the 
low competitiveness of the 
election. In 2019, there was 
one 
party, 
Engage, 
while 
there were eight in 2018’s 
election. 
“I think that generally … 
the more executive tickets 
you have running, the more 
likely you’re to see higher 
voter turnout,” Del Priore 
said. “So I think in (the 
Winter 2019) election, there 
were actually fewer executive 
tickets than had been to go 
in past years and so I think 
that we speculated that that 
was a large driver of lower 
turnout.” 
The University’s student 
turnout 
rate 
for 
Central 
Student 
Government 
elections 
counters 
voting 
trends for national elections. 
University 
student 
voter 
turnout rate for the 2016 
presidential 
election 
and 
the 2018 midterm elections 
were about 45 percent and 41 
percent respectively — two to 
four times the turnout in the 
Central Student Government 
elections of those same years. 
For 
Michigan 
State’s 
student 
government, 
the 
Associated 
Students 
of 

Michigan State, executives 
are elected through ASMSU 
representatives rather than by 
direct election by the student 
body. 
ASMSU 
President 
Mario Kakos attributed the 
low voter turnout rate at 
his school to the structure 
of 
ASMSU 
elections 
and 
the $100 cap on candidate 
campaign expenditures. 
“The 
idea 
behind 
(the 
spending caps) is to ensure 
that 
it’s 
equitable 
for 
anyone who wants to run 
for any position. So you’re 
not 
going 
to 
see 
people 
passing out 1,000 buttons. 
You’re not going to see any 
yard signs,” Kakos said. “I 
personally don’t believe that 
student engagement will be 
something that is ever really 
achieved.”
CSG’s compiled code allows 
individual 
candidates 
to 
spend $150 of personal funds 
on their campaigns, while 
executive tickets can spend 
up to $500. The code also 
limits the amount students 
can donate to candidates. 
Individual 
candidates 
are 
only allowed $75 per donor, 
while executive tickets are 
permitted $250. Further, a 
donor can contribute no more 
than $500 in a particular 
election.
Aneesh Deshpande, spring 
elections committee chair of 
Rutgers University Student 
Assembly 
attributed 
the 
drop of their turnout from 12 
percent in 2018 to 2 percent in 
2019 to a lack of competition 
in the latter year. He further 
highlighted 
that 
Rutgers, 
being a primarily commuter 
school, witnesses low turnout 

rates because the majority of 
students live off-campus.
However, 
Jared 
Long, 
internal vice president of 
University 
of 
Nebraska’s 
student 
government, 
credited 
their 
high 
voter 
turnout to their focus on 
issues that solely concern 
students, something he said 
distinguishes 
them 
from 
other student governments 
that tend to focus on issues on 
which they have little impact, 
like immigration.
“A lot of other Big Ten 
student governments focus 
on a lot of hot-button issues, 
things that really parallel 
the 
American 
government 
and the American political 
system,” Long said. “And 
while, 
of 
course, 
we 
all 
as engaged students have 
options in regards to what 
policies are happening at the 
national level, we at Nebraska 
avoid those hot-button issues, 
which I think results in the 
fact that we are not alienating 
large parts of the student 
body.”
Long 
also 
spoke 
about 
the importance of student 
participation in the activities 
of 
their 
school’s 
student 
government 
through 
voting and the necessity of 
increasing voter turnout. He 
said he did not expect his 
school to be the highest at 16 
percent, conceding that it is 
not a turnout rate to be proud 
of.
“Unfortunately, 
student 
government is not something 
students take interest in when 
they really should,” Long 
said. “When administrators 
are tackling a problem and 

they want student input, they 
turn to student government 
members. 
So 
student 
government is the easiest way 
to get connected with the 
university 
administration. 
For that reason alone, I think 
people should take an interest 
in student government.”
Jinwook 
Hwang, 
the 
University 
of 
Maryland 
Student 
Government 
Association’s 
director 
of 
communication, 
credited 
their high voter turnout to 
consistently 
competitive 
elections as well as the ticket 
system. Hwang said few other 
schools use the ticket system, 
in which four students can 
run together on a unified 
ticket.
“UMD’s voter turnout was 
unique in the fact that people 
don’t really see double-digit 
turnout but it was possible 
for us mainly because there 
was a lot of competition,” 
Hwang said. “We had three 
different 
teams 
running 
against each other and so the 
competition was advanced 
when candidates started to 
reach out to communities that 
usually did not get reached 
out to.”
In Ann Arbor as of Sunday 
night, two parties, Mobilize 
and Change at Michigan, 
have launched campaigns for 
the 
University’s 
upcoming 
2020 winter elections.
Public Health junior Grace 
Sleder didn’t vote in the 
Winter 2019 elections. She 
attributed her decision to 
a lack of information about 
the issues and candidates’ 
platforms. 
“I think in my freshman 

year I voted, but it’s only 
because I knew someone who 
was running,” Sleder said. 
“For a presidential election, 
you wouldn’t just vote based 
on who you think has the best 
sounding name or something, 
you want to be informed on 
the issues, and I just don’t 
feel like I’m informed enough 
to make a good decision or 
vote.” 
She said she wishes there 
was a better system to learn 
about what each candidate 
was running on and what 
voting for them meant, such 
as including the candidates’ 
platforms on the email the 
elections director sends to 
the student body informing 
them of the elections. 
On the other hand, Public 
Policy junior Bryce Brannen 
voted in 2019 CSG elections 
after she found out about them 
through 
current 
President 
Ben 
Gerstein’s 
Facebook 
page, who was running at the 
time, and saw posters of other 
party candidates. Brannen 
said voting was essential for 
her as the work CSG does 
directly impacts her day-to 
day-life as a student.
“I think voting is important 
no 
matter 
how 
small 
or 
how big (the government 
is),” Brannen said. “Voting 
obviously makes a difference 
and is a great way to have 
your voice be heard and make 
sure that there are people 
who are representing you 
that you ideally agree with.”

Saturday.

It was no epiphany. It was easy 

to see the work he put in over the 

course of 60 minutes to accumulate 

to a 20-save blank sheet.

When asked, he’ll always 

deflect the credit elsewhere. Some 

nights, it’s all about the defense 

in front of him, blocking shots or 

throwing checks. Other nights, 

it’s the offense, keeping the puck 

in the other zone. Saturday night, 

as Michigan notched a 3-0 win to 

move onto the semifinals of the 

Big Ten Tournament, it was, again, 

the defense making all of Michigan 

State’s chances not hard to save. 

“This was probably the best 

we’ve played defensively all year,” 

Mann said. “And I don’t know how 

many grade A’s I’ve had to face but 

it wasn’t a lot this weekend.”

But the real story was all about 

Mann — he was the man of the 

hour.

A shutout is no easy feat. After 

earning his fifth the day before, he 

tied for second in the nation for 

most shutouts. One day later, he did 

it again. Sixty minutes. One hour. 

That’s how long he had to laser 

in in-game, but his match started 

much earlier.

To most players, there’s practice. 

There’s team meetings. There’s 

warmups, and then there’s the 

game. 

“Some guys when they come, 

they don’t think about hockey until 

they get to the rink,” Kris Mayotte 

said Jan. 30. “And then once they 

leave the rink, sometimes they 

don’t think about it again until they 

come back the next day.”

Mann’s routine and structured 

lifestyle has been often noted. He 

has a strict diet that he follows to 

a T. He requires 10 hours of sleep. 

He has made sacrifices in how he 

lives to better his hockey career. 

Because of his discipline off the ice, 

the coaches trust that whenever he 

leaves the building, he’ll have his 

mind and heart on hockey.

“It’s something that’s on his 

mind all the time,” Mayotte said. 

“The pre-work or even the post-

work of what’s going to happen here 

at the rink, you know, that just that 

tends to build on itself, and its success 

usually follows.”

And his success has followed. He’s 

the third best goaltender in the nation 

based on save percentage, which he’s 

recorded at .939. He’s claimed the sole 

spot of most shutouts with six and a 

goals against average of 1.85.

Sure, his defense helped by 

blocking shots and limiting Grade-A 

chances, but he ultimately made 

the saves and stopped the puck. 

To Mayotte, it’s success that Mann 

believes he deserves.

“A lot of it is the mental side of it, 

and knowing that you’ve sacrificed 

as much as you possibly can to be 

where you are,” Mayotte said. “So 

you just feel like you’re prepared as 

well as you can be and so you feel 

like you deserve success. 

“And I think that’s a lot of what 

he feels and he does.”

Even off the ice and away from 

the play, he maintains focus that 

carries over to on-ice success. 

Before the game Saturday, the 

Wolverines were in the weight 

room, getting ready for the 

Spartans. Freshman forward 

Johnny Beecher joked that he 

felt someone to his left and after 

getting no response to a question 

he asked, he figured it was Mann. 

Mann was dialed in and nothing 

anyone could do would get him out 

of his zone.

“He’s super into his craft,” 

Beecher said. “I mean, he takes 

care of himself really well and it’s 

exciting to watch.”

Even for game-day meals, he had 

a continuation of his Paleo-esque 

diet. 

“He had poached eggs for 

breakfast,” Michigan coach Mel 

Pearson said. “I told him, ‘What’s 

the difference between the eggs 

that are hard boiled and the 

poached eggs?’ ”

But there are differences, besides 

the obvious. Everything he does, he 

does meticulously in a way that will 

bring him success on the ice.

A game of hockey lasts sixty 

minutes, and Saturday night, Mann 

played them to flatline Michigan 

State’s offense. But to him, the 

game started much earlier than 

that.

T

wenty minutes after 
Michigan had sealed a 
win over Michigan State, 
and with it a berth in the Big 
Ten Tournament semifinals, a 
continuation 
of a run that 
has seen the 
Wolverines 
lose just three 
times since 
the New Year 
and climb 
back into 
contention 
for an NCAA 
Tournament 
bid, Hayden 
Lavigne wore a blue suit and tie. 
Clean cut, with everyone around 
him still covered in sweat.
Lavigne didn’t play on Friday. 
Or on Saturday. He hasn’t played 
since Nov. 23, when he got his 
only start of the season in net 
and lost, letting up his third 
goal of the night 36 seconds into 
overtime in a non-conference 
game at New Hampshire. 
He spent this weekend stand-
ing next to assistant coach Kris 
Mayotte on the back row of 
Michigan’s bench, and when 
senior forward Jake Slaker put 
the series away with an empty-
net goal in the final minute on 
Saturday, all Lavigne could do 
was crane his neck and watch.
“Honestly, it was probably 
one of the easier weekends I’ve 
had to face all year,” sophomore 
goaltender Strauss Mann said 
after shutting the Spartans out 
twice. Mann is the story. He has 
been the story throughout the 
season. He will be the story as 
long as Michigan’s season goes 
on. 
This puts Lavigne — a senior 
who two years ago won a com-
petition for playing time, played 
the way Mann is playing now 
and took Michigan all the way 
to the Frozen Four — in an espe-
cially fascinating spot.
“It’s a different position, obvi-
ously,” Lavigne said, as Mann 
spoke to a group of reporters a 

few feet away. “And not neces-
sarily one that I want to be in, 
but at the same time, winning 
like this is a fun atmosphere just 
to be around in general.”
Over the course of this con-
versation, Lavigne 
will say all the 
right things. He’s 
accepting the role 
and doing what 
he can, enjoy-
ing the wins as 
they come. But 
it’s clear that two 
years ago, when 
he skated off the 
ice in Minneapolis 
after letting in a 
goal with under 10 seconds to go 
and ending Michigan’s season, 
this wasn’t how Lavigne saw his 
career winding down.
He attended the Nashville 
Predators’ development camp 

in the summer of 2018, and it 
was easy to see a path to playing 
NHL hockey. 
Now, he’s not sure what comes 
next. He’s been putting out 
feelers, hoping for an amateur 
tryout contract 
after Michigan’s 
season ends.
“It’s hard 
though, when 
you don’t play 
any games all 
year,” Lavigne 
said. “There’s 
definitely guys 
that put up 
numbers as 
a senior with 
more games played, like (Michi-
gan State goaltender John) Let-
hemon’s played 35 and is top in 
the country. So he’s obviously 
looking for a spot as well. So 
(there’s) competition out there 

that’s in a little bit better shape 
than I am, but I’ll figure it out 
and find somewhere to go.”
Lavigne’s career hit a low 
point prior to coming to Michi-
gan. Playing in the USHL after 
committing to 
the Wolverines 
in 2013, the 
Tri-City Storm 
and Waterloo 
Blackhawks 
cut him before 
he eventually 
stuck with the 
Bloomington 
Thunder. This, 
though, is dif-
ferent. Lavigne 
is older, which means he has 
mental clarity he didn’t then. It 
also means there’s no light at the 
end of the tunnel in the form of a 
scholarship waiting for him.
He can’t point to a moment in 

the last two years when things 
flipped. During the 2018-19 
season, he and Mann split time 
in net, and neither played par-
ticularly well. He worked with a 
coach during the summer to get 
better with the 
mental side of the 
game and came 
back feeling good. 
Before this sea-
son, Lavigne was 
an All-Big Ten 
honorable men-
tion. Competing 
until one of the 
two goaltenders 
pulled ahead felt 
the logical path.
It never happened.
When asked about it, Lavigne 
laughed.
“There was the expectation 
that we were gonna battle for 
the starting position,” he said. 

“That being said, I didn’t play my 
first game until November. So …” 
He trailed off.
The simple fact of the matter 
is, Mann seized the job before 
Lavigne ever had a chance to 
compete for it. No one can say 
it was the wrong decision on 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson’s 
end — yet it’s clear Lavigne 
would’ve liked that chance. This 
is the delicate position he finds 
himself in as his college career 
nears its end. Unable to blame 
anyone, but frustrated nonethe-
less.
“I mean, it wasn’t even clear 
by opening night,” Lavigne said. 
“It was just weekend and week-
end at the start of the year, and 
then eventually, I didn’t get to 
play. So then it was the role that 
I was in.”
He doesn’t tiptoe around the 
fact that his career reached its 
high point two years ago, nor 
the reality that a chance to top 
it isn’t in sight. He says it’s not a 
big deal, though of course it is — 
if not for the Michigan hockey 
team, then certainly for him 
personally.
“It was hard,” Lavigne said. 
“I’m a competitive person, like 
I want to play. I want to win. So 
that was a tough thing to kinda 
get used to. At the same time, 
early in the year, I was preparing 
thinking that I was gonna get 
that opportunity. I was gonna 
eventually get my share of those 
games. And then that kept me 
focused the first little bit. 
“And then now it’s just the 
idea that I’m playing for my next 
year, or if anything does hap-
pen this year. So that keeps me 
focused now.”
The cold, hard reality is that 
all he can do is show up each 
night and take his spot next to 
Mayotte, staying ready in case 
an opportunity comes.

The odd predicament of Hayden Lavigne

Blanked

It wasn’t supposed to be easy, 
but Johnny Beecher made it look 
effortless.
In the final minutes of the 
second period on Saturday night, 
the freshman forward got the 
puck way back in the defensive 
zone, then took the game into his 
own hands. He raced down the 
left side and perfectly weaved 
through two opponents to get 
to the slot. Beecher didn’t take 
the one-on-one shot against 
goaltender John Lethemon — 
instead, he dashed wide past the 
right post.
The offensive burst looked 
like it might be over, and yet 
the way he attacked the net was 
enough to create awe by itself. 
But after skating past the net, 
Beecher went around the right 
circle and fired a shot into the 
bottom right corner of the net. 
That goal put the Michigan 
hockey team (18-14-4 overall, 
12-10-3-2 Big Ten) up by two and 
fueled the Wolverines to a 3-0 
win over Michigan State (15-19-
2, 11-12-2), Saturday night at Yost 
Ice Arena. And with the victory, 
a Michigan team once left for 
dead advanced to the semifinals 
of the Big Ten Tournament.
“From where we were in 
December to where we are now, 
this team has shown tremendous 
growth,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “They’ve hung in 
there. We were 0-6-1 in the Big 
Ten at one point. It’s been well 
documented. … It’s a tremendous 
credit to the young men that we 
have in that locker room. Good 
for them. I’m really proud of that 
for them.”
The 
Wolverines 
knew 
ahead of time it could be tough 
playing an opponent who’s on 
the brink of elimination. And 
it was challenging at the start. 
Following the Spartans’ limited 
offensive 
production 
Friday 
night, they showed more urgency 
on the attack from the moment 
Saturday’s game started.
“I don’t think we had a lot of 
energy from the get-go,” Pearson 

said. “It was a struggle to start. 
We knew it would be. Anytime 
you’re facing elimination, you’re 
gonna get the other team’s best 
effort. I thought they played 
hard and we hung in there.”
After 
a 
tense, 
scoreless 
opening 
period 
Michigan 
got on the board early in the 
second while on the power play. 
Sophomore defenseman Nick 
Blankenburg and senior forward 
Jake Slaker passed back and 
forth from the high slot to the 
right circle. Blankenburg finally 
rifled a shot toward Lethemon, 
and 
senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood tipped it on its way to 
the back of the net.
That first goal was critical, but 
it wasn’t until Beecher’s that the 
Wolverines got breathing room.
“I think we just came out 
strong and did the little things 
right,” Beecher said of the 
pivotal second period. “I think 
we weren’t extremely happy 
with our first period and we 
knew the things that we needed 
to work on. Obviously, getting 
those two goals is massive and 
that gave us the momentum for 
the rest of the game.”
Michigan’s 
defense 
faced 
increased pressure to start the 
game, until just under four 
minutes in when forward Brody 
Stevens went to the box for 
interference. The Wolverines 
created solid chances with the 
extra man. 
At one point, Lockwood took a 
shot from the left side. The shot 
was blocked, but fell right by the 
crease. Senior forward Jacob 
Hayhurst immediately reached 
out to try and swipe it into the 
empty right side of the net. But 
his stick met the defender’s 
square on to keep the game 
scoreless.
Michigan’s 
special 
teams 
couldn’t convert on the rest of 
the opening power play. The 
Wolverines went on the penalty 
kill twice in the first frame, too, 
but defended them successfully. 
Michigan 
State 
established 
good puck movement on both 
attempts, but Michigan’s players 
managed to cut off the shooting 

lanes.
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
stayed staunch the rest of the 
game as well, killing a third, and 
final, penalty. With the stellar 
performance, the Spartans have 
scored just two goals on Mann in 
the last four meetings combined 
— all of them Michigan wins.
“Defense 
wins 
championships, 
they 
say,” 
Pearson said. “So if we don’t give 
up any goals, we’ve got a pretty 
good chance to win some hockey 
games.”
Once the offense found its 
groove in the second period it 
was Michigan’s game to lose. 
And in the final minute of the 
game, Slaker wrapped it up with 
an empty-net goal to send his 
team cruising into a semifinal 
at Ohio State. Such an outcome 
would’ve seemed unfathomable 
just a few months back.
“I think in the beginning of 
the season guys were pretty 
down,” Beecher said. “Obviously 
nobody was happy with what 
was going on. But I think the 
biggest thing is guys kind of 
realized that if we really buy in 
and come together as a team then 
we can do something special.”

Michigan sweeps Michigan State in Big Ten Tourney with a pair of 3-0 shutouts and a power play led by Nick Blankenburg

A little over three months 
ago, Nick Blankenburg had the 
primary assist on a power play 
goal against Wisconsin.
Senior forward Jake Slaker 
passed 
the 
puck 
back 
to 
Blankenburg who waited at the 
blueline. He hit a one-timer in 
the direction of the net. Jacob 
Hayhurst and Will Lockwood 
were positioned in front of the 
Badgers’ goaltender acting as 
a 
double 
screen. 
Lockwood 
managed to get his stick on the 
puck, and it connected with 
twine. The goal gave Michigan a 
2-0 lead in a game it went on to 
eventually lose. 
“Blanks did a great job just 
shooting 
the 
puck 
today,” 
Lockwood said on Nov. 30 
against Wisconsin. “Earlier in 
the year, he would’ve shied away 
from that. But he’s got a lot of 
confidence right now, and he’s 
got a great shot.”
Saturday night, an almost 
identical play to the goal against 
the Badgers happened. 
Blankenburg had the puck at 
the edge of the offensive zone. 

The Wolverines were on the man 
advantage, and he had options to 
pass.
Slaker drifted near one of 
the faceoff circles. Blankenburg 
recognized his positioning was 
perfect for a one-time shot off 
a pass — a Slaker staple. But he 
didn’t take the shot. Instead, 
he dished the puck back to 
Blankenburg who rifled a shot as 
he slid on one knee. 
In front of Michigan State 
netminder 
John 
Lethemon 
stood Hayhurst and Lockwood. 
Once again, just like on Nov. 30, 
Lockwood tipped Blankenburg’s 
shot into the net. This time, the 
goal broke a scoreless tie and put 
Michigan ahead.
“I just tried putting it on net,” 
Blankenburg said. “I know the 
earlier powerplay had a similar 
shot. Just try getting it to the net. 
I’m confident in Hayhurst being 
in front of the goalie. I know he’s 
a smaller guy, but he does a good 
job, and Will getting that double 
screen is big, too.”
Being able to convert on 
man advantage opportunities 
is 
critical, 
especially 
in 
postseason play. Saturday night, 
Blankenburg’s shot yielded a 

goal that gave the Wolverines 
crucial separation from the 
Spartans in an eventual 3-0 win. 
It gave them momentum. With 
solid defensive play, it ended up 
being all Michigan needed to 
win.
Blankenburg’s been a key 
component on the powerplay 
all season for Michigan. At 
the beginning of the season, 
it wasn’t as apparent. The 
powerplay struggled. A lot. But 
Blankenburg and his teammates 
believed in the system. They 
bought in. 
Now, they move the puck 
much better. The movement 
allows for much better scoring 
opportunities. 
And 
recently, 
Blankenburg 
has 
been 
quarterbacking the whole thing.
He’s 
one 
of 
the 
more 
offensive-minded 
defenders 
on the team. It’s likely because 
for the majority of his hockey 
career, he played forward. 
And like Lockwood pointed 
out 
back 
in 
November, 
Blankenburg’s 
confidence 
in 
his shot is apparent. It’s not just 
visible on power play goals like 
the one Saturday night. He’s 
tallied 68 shots and four goals 
this season. The development of 
his shot has been a point of focus 
for him this year.
“Just working on it in practice 
and just getting the opportunity 
to be there,” Blankenburg said, 
when asked about his shot. “I 
think in the start of the year we 
were kind of figuring out what 
worked and what we liked (on 
the powerplay). I think we kind 
of found that out from trial and 
error and whatnot.”
On 
Saturday 
night, 
Blankenburg’s shot influenced 
the game. It gave Michigan 
enough to complete a Big Ten 
Tournament 
quarterfinal 
sweep of the Spartans. As the 
Wolverines move on to the 
semifinals against Ohio State, 
having a source of offense from 
a defender and a confident player 
running the power play unit 
could be a difference maker. 
And 
that’s 
exactly 
what 
Blankenburg provides them.

COLLEGE PARK — Franz 
Wagner played the first eight 
minutes 
of 
Sunday’s 
game 
against Maryland aggressively 
and efficiently. 
The freshman scored five 
quick points, notched a steal 
and was leading the surging 
Wolverines. Then, the lanky 
forward was called for his 
second foul attempting to swat 
a ball down low. The minute 
that second whistle sounded, 
Wagner 
secured 
himself 
a 
comfy chair on the bench. His 
first half minutes were done.
From there, the Terrapins 
showed why they were the top 
dogs — or turtles, rather — en 
route to clinching a share of 
the Big Ten regular season 
title. Using a combination of 
outside 
shooting, 
offensive 
fluidity and a dislodging of 
the Wolverines’ defense, No. 
9 Maryland (24-7 overall, 14-6 
Big Ten) dismantled Michigan 
(19-12, 10-10), 83-70.
Following 
Wagner’s 
benching, 
the 
first 
half 
displayed Maryland’s ceiling 
and Michigan’s basement.
“I think that kind of changed 
the momentum of the game, 
to be honest,” Wagner said. 
“I thought we were there for 
those eight minutes … which is 
especially frustrating because 
I thought those two fouls came 
because I was there, I was ready 
to help. And we were flying 
around the way we wanted on 
defense and that was definitely 
frustrating, but guys told me to 
keep playing and keep my head 
up and get ready for the second 
half, and I think I did that.”
The 
Terrapins 
came 
as 
advertised. Open 3-pointers 
were drilled with ease, and the 
offense was firing off crowd-
hyping play one right after the 
other. Maryland had its way 
with the Wolverines’ defensive 

miscues, and it showed on 
the scoreboard as well as the 
highlight reel.
The Terrapins’ offense was 
a steady steamroller, refusing 
to bow to even Michigan’s best 
efforts. Maryland racked up a 
cool 1.37 points per possession 
in the first half and accentuated 
the first 20 minutes with a 
variety of big plays.
For instance, late in the first 
half, following an ill-advised 
hook shot from senior guard 
Zavier Simpson, the Terrapins 
ran the ball in transition and 
found the cutting forward 
Jalen Smith, who hammered 
the ball home with authority. 
The place went nuts.
A 
few 
possessions 
later, 
Maryland 
guard 
Anthony 
Cowan scored on back-to-back 
possessions. Again, the crowd 
roared, former Terrapin star 
Bruno Fernando flexing on the 
sidelines, fired up by the senior 
guard’s performance.
The only offensive bright 
spot for the Wolverines came 
from sophomore guard David 
DeJulius, who put up 13 points 
in the first half and was the only 
one who seemed to remember 
how to shoot a basketball. He 
finished with a team-high 20 
points in the strong shooting 
performance.
“Just doing all I can do,” 
DeJulius said. “Just being a 
leader, coming out there, being 
a playmaker, being aggressive 
out there on both ends of the 
floor, guarding, it’s just kind 
of doing everything this team 
needs. It’s just kind of coming 
in and having a positive plus-
minus.”
Outside of DeJulius, it’s 
clear the offense hobbled early 
following Wagner’s fouls. With 
him on the bench, Michigan 
stagnated while Maryland beat 
its offensive drum steadily 
through the half.
“We 
were 
scrambling,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 

Howard said. “Franz, he’s a 
big part of our team. Not only 
on the defensive end but on the 
offensive end with his outside 
shooting, his length. The way 
he attacks the basket with 
force.
“As you’ve seen, in the 
beginning of the second half 
when Franz was in the game, 
he just started to give us 
that offensive punch that we 
needed. 
Unfortunately, 
you 
can’t control those types of 
situations in the game where 
you’re hoping that you had all 
hands on deck, guys not in foul 
trouble, but it happens. We 
truly missed him in the first 
half.”
The first-half exclamation 
point came from a buzzer 
beating 3-pointer from Smith 
whose lanky frame resembled 
an exclamation point itself 
standing 
at 
center 
court 
following the make. With the 
three, Smith made it a 41-28 
lead at the break.
The second half continued 
along 
much 
of 
the 
same 
trajectory, 
albeit 
with 
Michigan finding a lot more 
life in between the orange 
circumference of the hoop 
— due in part to Wagner’s 
reappearance. The Wolverines 
began 
drilling 
shots 
— 
highlighted by Wagner and 
Simpson — and managed to 
pull the game within three.

The 
defense 
showed 
a 
bit 
more 
life 
as 
well, 
characterizing a much better 
half of basketball holistically 
for Michigan.
But 
the 
Wolverines 
just 
couldn’t 
get 
stops. 
Their 
defense continues to be a thorn 
in the side of the team, planting 
a firm roadblock on the path to 
big wins.
“They scored 83 points,” 
Wagner said. “It’s definitely a 
problem. Again, 3-point shots. 
Like I said last time, I don’t 
think we played bad defense all 
game, but I think we had two 
or three stretches where we let 
them get going, and that hurt 
us down the stretch.”
Despite 
pulling 
within 
three though, the Wolverines 
coughed 
up 
a 
few 
dead 
possessions giving Maryland 
the breathing room it needed 
to maintain a solid lead. From 
there, the Terrapins did nearly 
everything 
right 
to 
keep 
Michigan at arm’s length.
In the end, whether it be 
Wagner’s fouls or a struggling 
defense, all the Wolverines 
could do was stand and watch 
as Maryland celebrated its Big 
Ten title right in their faces. 
Now, Michigan retreats to 
Ann Arbor to lick its wounds 
ahead 
of 
the 
impending 
tournament season and pray 
that Wagner doesn’t catch 
early fouls in the future.

COLLEGE PARK — It has 
been a big year for David 
DeJulius. 
After a difficult freshman 
season struggling for playing 
time and riding the bench behind 
senior guard Zavier Simpson, 
DeJulius has grown by leaps and 
bounds in his sophomore year. 
He’s played significant minutes 
in every game this season and 
has proven himself a reliable 
piece of Michigan’s backcourt, 
averaging seven points and three 
rebounds a game.
His performance at Maryland 
on Sunday was proof positive of 
how far he’s come. He delievered 
20 
points, 
a 
defensive 
rebound 
and 
a steal in 20 
minutes. 
It 
was a stat line 
DeJulius could 
only 
have 
dreamed of a 
year ago today: 
He was the only 
Wolverine 
to 
top 20 points 
against 
the 
Terrapins in an 83-70 loss.
“I just said, ‘To hell with 
it, I’m going in aggressive,’ ” 
DeJulius said. “I don’t have 
anything to lose at this point, so 
I might as well come in and give 
the team all I can in all phases on 
the floor.”
With junior guard Eli Brooks 
and junior forward Isaiah Livers 
playing unusually quiet, only 
scoring six points apiece on the 
day, most of the spark on offense 
came from DeJulius, be it from 
a drained 3-pointer or a quick 
screen pass on the outside. 
It was a boost Michigan sorely 
needed, especially as it struggled 
to score early on. DeJulius’ 
points were a big part of what 
helped the Wolverines stay in 
the game for as long as they did.

“Big lift, especially in the 
first half, when we struggled to 
score,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said. “There were some 
possessions when the ball wasn’t 
going in, wasn’t getting anything 
to the basket, and then David 
came in. Which is his role, and 
he’s embraced his role of being a 
guy who can come in and bring 
some energy. 
“He’s another guy who can 
be an attacker on the floor and 
another guy who can make some 
decision-making for us when he 
has the ball in his hands. When 
the ball was in David’s hands, 
good things happened.”
Against a Maryland team 
that had a size advantage of 
at least a few inches at every 
position, DeJulius 
caught on early 
to 
Maryland’s 
switches 
and 
attacked 
them 
effectively 
throughout 
the 
game, 
an 
adjustment 
many 
of his teammates 
didn’t make until 
halftime.
“He’s 
a 
very 
confident 
player,” 
associate head coach Phil Martelli 
told The Daily. “He attacked the 
switching, which is where I think 
we got in trouble a little bit. That lull 
in the first half, that was because we 
didn’t attack their switching. David 
did a very good job of going at that.” 
DeJulius’s 
performance 
in 
College Park is a testament to his 
growth. At the time his team needs 
him most, he’s giving it exactly what 
it’s missing. But more than that, 
DeJulius is coming into his own as 
a player. The blow to his confidence 
he suffered with that year on the 
bench is long gone — just take it 
from him.
“This 
is 
good 
for 
my 
confidence,” DeJulius said. “I’m 
just going for it going into the 
postseason. I’m just going to 
continue to build off of this.”

Shell shocked

DeJulius scores 20, but Michigan falls short, dropping regular-season finale to Maryland, 83-70

Johnny Beecher’s work pays off

Johnny 
Beecher 
brought 
his stick up over his shoulder 
and slammed it to the ice in 
frustration.
The 
freshman 
forward, 
sprung on a breakaway thanks 
to a pass from graduate transfer 
forward Jacob Hayhurst, had cut 
to the front of the net and tried 
to send the puck five-hole on his 
backhand past Michigan State 
goaltender John Lethemon. It 
was late in the second period of 
Friday’s game, and Beecher was 
looking for his second goal of the 
night.
But Lethemon got down in 
his butterfly to make the save, 
and as Beecher watched him 
make the stop, he became visibly 
frustrated. Beecher’s goal earlier 
in the game was his first since 
scoring two goals on Jan. 17 at 
Penn State — but it wasn’t the 
kind of flashy goal Beecher has 
demonstrated a tendency toward 
this year.
The puck had simply bounced 
off his skate and into the net after 
Hayhurst tipped a long-range 
shot from senior defenseman 
Luke Martin.
“I had an ugly one last night,” 
Beecher said Saturday. “Tried 
to get the monkey off my back a 
little bit, off my foot.”
Saturday 
night, 
Beecher 
flipped the script. He scored 
again — his ninth goal of the 
season — in dramatic, highlight-
reel fashion, helping propel 
Michigan to a 3-0 win over the 
Spartans.
After 
forward 
Mitchell 
Lewandowski’s shot sailed wide 
of the Wolverines’ net, Beecher 
skated over to the side boards 
to collect the puck. He began to 
move the puck up the ice, as he 
would in any normal breakout 
from the defensive zone.
There wasn’t a clear option to 
pass to, and as Beecher moved 
through the neutral zone, he 
started to pick up speed. Then he 
picked up a little more and then a 
little more.
He met two Michigan State 
skaters on the entry to the 
offensive 
zone, 
and 
neither 
Lewandowski nor defenseman 

Dennis 
Cesana 
could 
do 
anything to slow him down.
Beecher wove between the 
two, cut across the top of the 
right circle and headed down the 
slot in front of Lethemon with 
a full head of steam. In many 
ways, his approach as he got 
close to Lethemon mirrored the 
breakaway attempt from Friday 
night that Lethemon saved.
This time, Beecher wasn’t able 
to get a shot off. He considered 
shooting five-hole again but 
ended up coming around left side 
of the net without taking a shot 
— with the puck still on his stick.
“Just keep going after it,” 
Beecher said. “... Unfortunately, 
I lost it. But at the end of the day 
you just gotta keep putting the 
puck on the net and hope it goes 
in.”
As Beecher swung around 
the top of the left circle, he saw 
Hayhurst providing a screen 
in front of Lethemon. Three 
quick steps later and — without 
warning — Beecher fired a shot 
that slipped between Lethemon’s 
left pad and the goal post.
The goal put Michigan ahead 

2-0 over the Spartans, and with 
how stingy the Wolverines’ 
defense had been all series, it 
started to look like two goals 
might be an insurmountable hill 
for Michigan State to climb.
“Obviously, Johnny Beecher’s 
goal is a big goal,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said. “From 
that point on, I thought we were 
in good control.”
Dramatic goals like Beecher’s 
on 
Saturday 
are 
frequently 
lucky, 
spur-of-the-moment 
occurrences that kind of come 

out of nowhere. But for Beecher, 
the goal represented a season’s 
worth of work on that kind of 
shot — and a bit of inspiration 
from Connor McDavid, who is 
currently second in the NHL 
with 95 points this season. 
“That’s kind of been a shot I’ve 
been trying to pull off the whole 
season,” Beecher said. “Coach 
Pearson actually sent me a clip, 
I want to say it was about three 
or four days ago. I think it was 
McDavid. He kind of wrapped 
around the top of the circle and 
he kind of let the same shot go. 
He had seen me try and do it 
a couple times before and just 
tried to give me a little bit of an 
idea.”
And instead of slamming his 
stick on the ice in frustration, 
as he’d done the night before, 
Beecher balled up his right 
fist and punched the ice in 
celebration 
before 
flinging 
himself into the glass in front of 
him as his teammates swarmed 
around him to continue the 
celebration.
As he skated back toward the 
bench for fist bumps from the 
rest of the Wolverines, Beecher 
brought his left fist up to his 
head and hit it against his helmet 
— a celebration that’s become 
common throughout the season. 
Sophomore forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe says it represents the team 
putting their hard hats on and 
going to work.
Saturday, Beecher went to 
work nearly 200 feet from where 
he eventually scored what’s 
arguably the most impressive 
goal of his Michigan career.
It paid off.

Wolverines split weekend series

This weekend, the No. 16 
Michigan softball team had two 
chances to assert itself and prove 
its fortitude. The first was against 
No. 1 UCLA (22-1). The second 
pitted the team against No. 22 
UCF (18-5). In both matchups, the 
Wolverines fell short.
The losses came at 2-0 and 3-2, 
respectively — each the result 
of Michigan’s (15-8) continued 
problem generating runs when it 
counts.
“I would say our offense right 
now is not doing its part — at all,” 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
said.
On 
paper, 
the 
Wolverines 
actually out-hit UCLA and UCF by 
a combined total of eight hits to six. 
And counting its other two games 
at the UCLA/LBSU Invitational, 
with a 5-1 win over Cal State 
Fullerton (14-9) and a 2-1 win over 
Boston University (12-6), Michigan 
had 11 more hits than its opponents 
on the weekend.
So finding a single hit wasn’t 
the Wolverines’ problem. It was 
stringing them together.
“But I’d just say we’re not 
getting the timely hits that we 
need to,” sophomore left fielder 
Lexie Blair said. “I’d say most of 
our losses from this weekend, 
especially against UCLA and UCF, 
it was just timely hitting for both 

opponents that we just couldn’t 
come up with. We couldn’t come 
up with stringing any hits together 
and getting any runs across.”
This was evident over the 
course of the invitational. Out of 
Michigan’s 23 hits on the weekend, 
13 of them came as the only hit in 
the inning.
With runners on base, the 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
fare 
much 
better. They stranded 24 runners 
over the course of four games, with 
a high of nine against Cal State 
Fullerton.
Blair 
didn’t 
attribute 
the 
struggles to Michigan’s physical 
capabilities, nor did she credit 
them to the prowess of the 
Wolverines’ opponents. To her, it 
was the team’s mental outlook in 
scoring situations that held it back.
“It’s easy to get way ahead of 
yourself and try to focus on the 
outcome,” Blair said. “Which, for 
our team, being outcome oriented 
doesn’t always grant you success.”
Senior center fielder Haley 
Hoogenraad 
echoed 
Blair’s 
sentiment by preaching Michigan’s 
mantra of “one pitch focus.”
“I think we just have to focus 
on the same thing we were trying 
to focus on the entire time,” 
Hoogenraad said. “You can only 
control what you can control. We 
struggled with that a little bit so I 
think that we need to do a better 
job of focusing on one pitch that we 
can control at a time.”

Despite 
poor 
offensive 
performance, the Wolverines took 
two of four games on the weekend 
and remained close against some 
of the top teams in the country. 
They held UCLA, a squad that 
averages 7.74 runs per game, to just 
two runs. And UCF was held to one 
run until the bottom of the eighth 
inning.
In each of Michigan’s wins, it 
held its opponent to just three hits 
and one run. In those victories, the 
Wolverines’ opponents reached 
base just 12 times in total.
The reason: pitching.
“Defense is led by the pitching,” 
Hutchins said. “When the pitchers 
are on, it makes our defense a lot 
easier. … I think our pitchers have 
set a really good tone, but our 
defense and offense need to pick 
up on it.”
Michigan stands less than 
a week away from its opening 
weekend in Ann Arbor. To find 
success, it will need to hold on to 
its pitching prowess and overhaul 
its offensive performance.
But the Wolverines won’t spend 
their time worrying about it. In 
fact, Hutchins wants them to do 
the exact opposite.
“We have to just go up there 
and swing,” Hutchins said. “Not 
worry about anything. Not worry 
whether it’s the right pitch. Not 
worry whether we miss. 
“That will help our swing get 
back to where we’re capable of.”

Missed 
opportunities 
haunt 
Wolverines

INDIANAPOLIS 
— 
Midway 
through the fourth quarter Saturday, 
as 
Ohio 
State 
nursed 
a 
three-
point lead, junior forward Hailey 
Brown found herself open with an 
opportunity to tie the game. 
The play felt like a rerun of the end 
of Friday’s duel with Northwestern, 
when Brown iced the win with a 
3-pointer off the glass. Another shot 
like that, and the Wolverines find 
themselves in a tie game with all the 
momentum. 
It rimmed out. 
Not to worry, though. After a quick 
miss from the Buckeyes, freshman 
guard Maddie Nolan found an open 
look of her own. She had buried 3-of-
4 from deep against the Wildcats, so 
this one felt like a certainty. 
Nope. Another clank off the rim.
As 
the 
buzzer 
sounded 
on 
Michigan’s 66-60 loss in the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinals, there hung a 
sense that the Wolverines could have 
won. Just one night earlier, almost 
everything fell in a perfect storm that 
ended in the tournament’s biggest 
upset. But Saturday, they just couldn’t 
hit the open shots they needed to pull 
off one more. 
“(Friday) we made shots. We won 
the game,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “If it was that 
easy — we didn’t make shots early 
(Saturday), and I think when you 
don’t make shots early, that messes 
with your confidence a little bit.”
Beyond that pair of missed threes, 
there were plenty of examples of 
Michigan not capitalizing on its 
opportunities. One could point to its 
5-for-11 mark from the free throw 
line, or players passing on open looks 
because they’d lost the confidence to 
shoot. Even sophomore guard Naz 
Hillmon — the Wolverines’ most 
reliable scorer, who finished with 
22 points — missed on a few layups 
where she’s usually automatic.
And while Michigan floundered, 
Ohio State pounced on every mistake. 
The Wolverines had just 12 turnovers 
on the game, but the Buckeyes 
took full advantage and grabbed 15 
easy points off them. Even though 
Michigan controlled the glass with 
21 offensive boards, it could only 
collect 16 second-chance points. Ohio 
State had 11 on just eight offensive 
rebounds. And when the Wolverines 
missed shots, the Buckeyes ran in 
transition and notched 17 fastbreak 
points. Michigan had none. 
“Whatever we did, they were able 
to adjust to, whether that was defense 
or offense,” senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson said. “Their coach really 
adjusted. And then attack defenders 
that came off the bench, they attacked 
them immediately.”
At 
this 
point 
in 
the 
season, 
everything — justifiably or not — 
will be looked at through the lens of 
March. Teams across the country will 
have to answer to being “made for 
March.” In this context, critics could 
view the Wolverines’ struggles down 
the stretch as evidence that they 
aren’t built for postseason basketball. 
In 
fairness, 
though, 
Michigan 
can hit those shots. It did in the 
previous two rounds of the Big Ten 
Tournament, and three close games 
in three days can be exhausting. 
But from here on out, it won’t 
matter if the Wolverines can hit shots, 
or if they could have won. 
Because if they don’t win, their 
season’s over.

INDIANAPOLIS 
— 
Michigan, 
for the second year in a row, stared 
down a chance to do something it had 
never done. No team, in the history of 
the program, has played in a Big Ten 
Tournament title game. For a program 
steeped in mediocrity, Saturday was 
an opportunity for the Wolverines to 
put their name down in history.
They gave it their best shot, but it hit 
the rim and bounced out.
Michigan (21-11 overall, 10-8 Big 
Ten) couldn’t buy a bucket, bowing out 
of the tournament in the semifinals for 
the second straight year, losing, 66-60, 
to Ohio State (21-11, 11-7).
Michigan’s offense played directly 
into its identity: shoot, rebound, shoot 
again. It was an offense reminiscent 
of the beginning of the season, 
when junior forward Hailey Brown 
sometimes struggled, her confidence 
gone, and when freshman guard 
Maddie Nolan barely played.
Teams then didn’t respect the 
Wolverines’ outside threat and packed 
the paint. The Buckeyes did exactly 
that in the teams’ first matchup in 
January. Saturday, Ohio State did 
the same. Brown and Nolan, riding 
hot hands coming into the game, 
found themselves with plenty of 
opportunities to score.
But their shots hit the rim — once, 
twice — and bounced out. Over and 
over and over again.
“I had the confidence to keep on 
shooting,” Brown said. “My teammates 
were putting me in good positions and 
drawing up plays to get those shots. … 
All my shots felt really good, they all 

felt on frame, I thought they were all 
going in.”
Brown ended the day 3-for-11 from 
beyond the arc.
Michigan’s offense was on life 
support, dragged along by sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon — the rebound 
part of the shoot, rebound, shoot 
again. She finished with 10 offensive 
rebounds and 16 total, leading to her 22 
points on the day. Even the unanimous 
all-Big Ten player, though, watched 
her shots bounce out, shooting 47.6 
percent compared to her season 
average 57.2.

“(The double team is) definitely 
difficult, just because any two-on-one, 
that’s tough to deal with,” Hillmon 
said. “But in the past couple of games, 
especially in the end of the regular 
Big Ten season, we faced that and we 
really tried to work on that.”
Those 
adjustments 
required 
teammates to make shots, shots that 
didn’t bounce out.
But, like the beginning of the Big 
Ten season, Michigan’s defense kept 
it in it. Ohio State shot equally poorly 

through the first quarter and the 
Wolverines settled in for a physical 
matchup of who could rebound better. 
A matchup they can beat almost every 
team at. Then Buckeyes’ guard Janai 
Crooms entered the game.
“They are balanced and they have 
seven players that are pretty much 
averaging the same, between 14 and 
10 points,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “And I thought that 
was really the difference when they 
brought in Crooms in the first half. I 
thought she did a great job for them.”
Two hours later, Michigan players 
were talking about her shiftiness 
in the locker room. She sparked a 
nine-point run and the Wolverines 
couldn’t conjure an answer of their 
own; Brown’s shots kept rimming out, 
Dilk’s drives were walled off, Hillmon 
suffered through double teams.
Late in the third quarter, the 
Wolverines finally found their mojo: 
Five quick points followed by a couple 
3-pointers drew them even with 7:18 
left in the game. The shots were falling, 
the bench was feeling it, momentum 
was theirs.
Then Ohio State called a timeout.
Afterwards, Hillmon watched her 
shot travel across the rim and into the 
hands of Dorka Juhasz.
Time and time again during the 
fourth quarter, Hillmon shook her 
head, lips drawn into a frown after 
another layup attempt bounced twice 
off the rim and into the waiting arms 
of a Buckeye.
Ohio State, meanwhile, regained its 
composure. It made plays, it hit free 
throws — nothing but net.
The game was over. History would 
have to wait.

when they

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Sophomore forward Naz Hillmon finished Saturday’s game with 22 points, but it wasn’t enough as Michigan lost 66-60 to Ohio State.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Junior forward Hailey Brown missed a 3-pointer to tie the game late in the fourth quarter of Michigan’s 66-60 loss to Ohio State.

Lack of 
secondary 
scoring 
plagues ‘M’

INDIANAPOLIS — Hailey Brown 
walked off the court three minutes 
into the second quarter, her head hung 
low, and slammed a towel down on 
the scorer’s table. The junior forward 
turned the ball over twice in the last 
minute and missed her first four shots 
of the game.
Brown’s 
frustration 
was 
a 
microcosm of a larger issue that held 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team back in its 66-60 loss to Ohio 
State on Saturday night. Throughout 
the game, the Wolverines secondary 
scorers 
struggled 
to 
create 
any 
offense.
“They were definitely disruptive,” 
Brown said. “They clogged the paint a 
lot so it was hard to get some looks at 
the rim.”
When Michigan lost to the Buckeyes 
on Jan. 9, sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon was the only consistent 
source of scoring, finishing with 24 
points. Senior forward Kayla Robbins 
complemented Hillmon early on, but 
foul trouble forced her to sit the final 
seven minutes of the first half and she 
couldn’t get back into a rhythm upon 
her return.
In the second half of that game, 
with 
nobody 
providing 
offense 
outside of Hillmon, Ohio State was to 
stage a fourth-quarter comeback and 
win a game Michigan controlled for 
its majority.
Which takes us to Saturday.
Once again, Hillmon got going early, 
scoring six first-quarter points, while 
four other players added a basket 
each, and the Wolverines took a two-
point lead into the second quarter.
But in the second, nobody could 
create besides her as she scored seven 
of Michigan’s 10 points in the quarter. 
Driving lanes were closed for 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk and senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson, forcing 
them to try to generate offense from 
the perimeter. The open 3-point shots 
that Brown had made a living on in 
the past two games disappeared — 
she only attempted one in the second 
quarter.
“They always wanted to stop our 
dribble penetration and kind of clog 
the paint so we couldn’t get anything 
in to Naz or Hailey or (freshman 
center Izabel Varejão), so that was 
pretty 
tough,” 
sophomore 
guard 
Danielle Rauch said. “(They) clogged 
the paint, and then some of our shots 
weren’t falling on the outside so it got 
tough.”
By halftime, no Michigan player 
besides Hillmon had made more than 
one field goal and the Wolverines 
trailed by six. Ohio State had all the 
incentive it needed to focus solely on 
her and force other players to beat it.
“They’re so long and athletic, it was 
kind of hard to get the skip passes 
and the extra passes like we did the 
first time,” Johnson said. “Our ball 
movement was very stagnant.”
Hillmon struggled in the third 
quarter while drawing even more 
attention, scoring just four points 
at a 40 percent clip. Michigan’s 
offense looked lost early on — they 
committed turnovers on their first 
three possessions of the half — before 
Brown and Johnson got going.
Johnson was finally able to find 
space in the paint and knocked down 
open jumpers. Brown got to the line 
twice and connected on a 3-pointer 
late in the quarter. Both scored six 
points in the third quarter as the 
Wolverines cut a 12-point Buckeye 
lead to just four entering the fourth.
“We just knew that they were 
double-teaming Naz so we had to 
make ourselves available,” Johnson 
said. “We started cutting and moving 
without the ball. And then we started 
setting more screens, actually running 
plays, getting people open shots.”
Brown hit an early triple in the 
fourth quarter and Rauch made a pull-
up jumper two possessions later to tie 
it, but after that the secondary scoring 
once again dried up. Ohio State 
focused more on the perimeter and 
the open shots that Michigan did get 
didn’t fall. By the time a player besides 
Hillmon scored again, the Buckeyes 
led by eight with two minutes left in 
the game.
And when Johnson finally got 
an open 3-pointer to fall with two 
seconds left — her first basket of the 
fourth quarter — it didn’t matter. 
There were no smiles. 
Only frustration they couldn’t get 
those shots earlier.
