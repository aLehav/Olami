ART FAIR
Art fair
funding
falls short
Directors cut perks
for artists, prepare
for smaller fair
By TORREY JOSEPH
ARMSTRONG
For the Daily
Organizers of the Ann Arbor
Street Art Fair are working to
repair a hole in the fair's budget,
which was estimated on Friday to
be about $35,000.
The fair, now in its 50th year
and the longest-running of Ann
Arbor's four annual art fairs, has
lost some corporate sponsorship,
while independent artists have
been renting fewer booths out of
caution, fair officials said. Before
Friday, the budget hole was origi-
nally thought to be $65,000.
Shary Brown, executive direc-
tor of the Ann Arbor Street Art
Fair, said national corporations
that previously sponsored the
fair, like Maybelline and Ninten-
do Wii Fit, are not producing as
many new products, so market-
ing tours are not taking place.
The sfate's economy has also
deterred corporate presence at
the fair, which is scheduled for
July 15-18.
"They're leery of Michigan,
and they're trying to be cautious,"
said Brown, in reference to the
corporations.
The event is expected to fea-
ture 147 artists, a drop from last

Shaman Drum to close

Local bookstore
couldn't compete with
online options
ByLARA ZADE
Managing News Editor
After 29 years of business, local
bookstore Shaman Drum Book-
shop will officially close its doors
on June 30 after suffering from fi-
nancial hardship in the past year.
In a written statement posted on
the shop's website Tuesday, Owner
Karl Pohrt wrote that after consult-
ing with his accountant and busi-
ness manager, it was clear to him
that the bookstore was no longer
a "sustainable business," despite a

"first rate staff, a fiercely loyal core
of customers, a very decent land-
lord and (his) own commitment to
the community of arts and letters
in Ann Arbor."
"The hardest thing about this
is losing the comrades that I've
worked with over the years," Pohrt
said in an interview Friday.
He also wrote that Ann Arbor
"continues to be an excellent book
town" and that remaining indepen-
dent bookstores need residents'
support.
Pohrt wrote in an open letter
printed in The Ann Arbor Chron-
icle on Feb. 17 that Shaman Drum
started losing money in September
due to "customers migrating to the
Internet coupled with the fright-
ening economic crisis."

In a Feb. 19 Michigan Daily ar-
ticle, Pohrt said that those two rea-
sons, along with the falling popu-
larity of books, "foretell the fate of
the already suffering independent
booksellers."
Pohrt said in the same article
that textbook sales in particular
have been declining at Shaman
Drum as more students buy their
books online through such outlets
as the UBook program, which is
an online book exchange that en-
courages professors to post their
required reading lists on CTools.
Students can then buy, sell and
trade books online through an inte-
grated exchange system at cheaper
prices.

ARCHAEOLOGY
Hunting grounds under Lake Huron

'U' researchers find
10,000-year-old relics
100 feet deep
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
University researchers recently
announced the groundbreakingdis-
covery of archaeological remains
under the surface of Lake Huron -
the first such find on the bottom of
the Great Lakes.
The researchers found caribou
hunting structures and camps pre-
served 100 feet deep in a location
100 miles wide in Lake Huron.
John O'Shea, curator of Great
Lakes Archaeology in the Museum
of Anthropology and a professor in
the Department of Anthropology,
said the area - which spreads from
Point Clark, Ontario to Presque Isle,
Mich. - was dry land 10,000 years
ago.
"It would have been a place where
earlyhunters would havebeen occu-
pying and where you would have had
caribou migrating," O'Shea said.
The researchers discovered lines
of boulders and rocks, called drive
lanes, on the lake floor that hunters

used to attract caribou, which natu-
rally follow lines.
Instead of building traps or stam-
peding caribou off cliffs, O'Shea said
hunters made lines - some about
350 meters long - on land that is
now below the lake's surface.
"You can guide the animals into
an area, then, where you step up
an ambush and where you attack
them," he said.
The group also discovered piles
of rocks, which they believe hunt-
ers crouched behind while waiting
for herds.
Although many people have
looked for sites like these, O'Shea
said no one had ever found any
under the Great Lakes.
O'Shea studied caribou hunting
sites preserved in the arctic and
used them as examples for finding
similar ones underwater.
"We knew about these arctic
examples, and so we kind of knew
what the sights ought to look like,
and that made it a lot easier then to
find them," he said.
A few years ago, a team includ-
ing O'Shea, Guy Meadows, direc-
tor of the Marine Hydrodynamics
Laboratories and a professor in the
departments of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering and Atmo-

spheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences
and Robert Reynolds, professor of
computer science at Wayne State
University, began simulating cari-
bou migrations and making a model
of what the area below Lake Huron
would have looked like as dry land.
Based on the reconstruction, the
group chose three areas to research.
Last fall, the team received a
grant from the National Science
Foundation to investigate the areas
usingsite scan sonar equipment and
remote operated vehicles that cap-
ture images underwater.
"(The vehicles) have a low light
video camera, and you drive them
using a joystick like a computer
game," O'Shea said.
Most recently, the team has
employed archaeologists trained in
scuba diving to investigate the site.
O'Shea said the scuba divers have
identified large projections of rocks
embedded with layers of chirt,
which is a raw material people used
to make tools.
"We're thinking this may be a site
where people would have quarried
stone for their stone tools," he said.
Rackham student Eric Rupley
will be joining the team of scuba div-
ers at the end of the summer. He said
he's excited to be able to participate

in the cutting edge exploration.
"When we get down there we get
into primary data that answers a
series of questions of this time peri-
od and history of America that we
have little information of," Rupley
said.
O'Shea said the discoveries made
at the site provide researchers the
opportunity to learn about the era
in the Great Lakes region when
early big game hunters first came to
North America from Asia.
"It's a time period in North
American pre-history when really
important things happened, and yet
we don't have any direct evidence
of how they happened," he said.
"The sites under the lake offera real
potential to tell us about this time
period that we can't find out about
any other way."
O'Shea added that the animals
and artifacts found at the few hunt-
ing sites in northern forests have
been mostly destroyed bythe acid in
soil, while the water from the lake
preserves organic material.
"All kinds of things that you
wouldn't be able to find on a ter-
restrial site you have the potential
to find them in the lake," he said.
"It's almost like a Pompeii, but with
water instead of lava."

Molnar said another factor in
his decision to open the store was
its ideal location in the heart of
downtown Ann Arbor.
He added that his store is dif-
ferent from other dessert stores in
the city offering similar products
because Carillon Chocolates is
"the only independent chocolate
shop reigning in Ann Arbor."
"I know Kilwin's is Ann Arbor-
based, but they have chains up in

Molnar added that his store
also boasts a quaint charm that's

"The Rocky Mountain Choco-

Molnar said he thinks his store

and "can tailor products and the

"The goal is to be more focused

said, adding that the client-base is
geared toward the people residing
in Ann Arbor.
By catering to young profes-

attracted to his business.
"We really want to focus on

Rerlouting priorities
Ann Arbor should maintain The Link in face of funding woes
Ann Arbor seems to have developed a split personality regarding
buses. This fall, The Link - the purple bus that circles downtown
Ann Arbor - may see part of its route discontinued. But at the
same time, the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority is adding a new com-
muter bus route to nearby Canton Township. These changes are sending
mixed messages about Ann Arbor's commitment to mass transportation.
While establishing a new bus route is commendable, shutting down the
buses that service downtown would be a blow for students and staff that
rely on free, easy transportation. The city of Ann Arbor shouldn't cancel
this important bus service. Instead, it should continue to provide afford-
able mass transportation options to residents and workers.

A president's enduring legacy
is often not the legislation passed
during his term or the executive
orders he signs. Often, it's the jus-
tices he nominates to the Supreme
Court. President George H.W.
Bush will forever be remembered
for nominating Justice David
Souter (a liberal) to the bench,
despite the fact that Souter's phil-
osophical ideals turned out to be
quite different from the former
president's. His son, President
George W. Bush, nominated two
conservative justices to the bench,
Justice John Roberts and Justice
Samuel Alito, whose political ide-
als will echo Bush's for years. Now,
President Barack Obama has his
first opportunity to put his philo-
sophical fingerprint on the highest
court in the land. But, unfortu-
nately, his nominee has more than
a few skeletons in her closet.
Judge Sonia Sotomayor has
a history of controversy deeper.
than just her famous comments
concerning the experiences of
Latinawomen. Sotomayorhas had
four out of six appealed decisions
overturned and has been cited
by the Supreme Court as using
faulty reasoning to reach one of
her decisions in a 2006 case. In
addition to these concrete legal
issues, Sotomayor has publically
expressed her support for judicial
activism. "The CourtofAppeals is
where policy is made," Sotomayor
said at a conference at Duke Uni-
versity Law School in 2005.
But it'sthe job of the legislature,
not the judicial system, to decide
policy. The courts are where laws
are tested, not -where they're
made. Legal decisions should be
based on impartial interpretations
of the law. Middle school civics
students can tell you activism on
the bench should be discouraged.
Politics aren't within the realm
of judges, though it would appear
that Sotomayor mayudisagree.
Congress should examine
another comment from Sotomay-
or. "I wonder whether by ignoring
our differences as women or men
of color we do a disservice both to

the law and society," she said at a
symposium at the University of
California, Berkeley in 2001. This
comment has worrisome implica-
tions for those who could be judged
on their genetic characteristics.
More importantly, what would
we say if a white man echoed sen-
timents that he should consider
race in his decisions? We would
be outraged, and rightfully so.
When a defendant goes before a
court, he or she is owed the neu-
trality of the judge.
Another area that requires
careful examination prior to con-
firmation is Sotomayor's record.
One case that stands out as trou-
bling is the oft-pub'licized Ricci v.
DeStefano. This New Haven, CT
case involved 18 firefighters who
passed a city promotions test but
were denied their promotion due
to the fact that no black firefight-
ers qualified for the promotion.
The firefighters, most of whom
werewhite, then sued the city for
racial discrimination. Making her
decision based on her own liberal
tendencies, and possibly with race
in mind, Sotomayor ruled in favor
of the city, upholding the idea
that although the 18 firefighters
studied and met the requirements
for their promotions, they should
be denied due to their ethnicity.
Sotomayor should have fought
racial preferences - even against
white men - instead of engaging
in judicial activism that denied
these firefighters their rightfully
earned positions.
Sotomayor will 'be subject to
mandatory congressional confir-
mation hearings, though Obama
has strongly indicated that he
would like to see her confirma-
tion occur by Aug. 7. But Soto-
mayor isn't the caliber of judge
we have come to expect on the
Supreme Court. Judicial activism
has no place on the highest court
in America. And Sotomayor's sup-
port of it makes her a candidate
requiring careful consideration.

At Ann Arbor's Downtown
Development Authority board
meeting on June 3, the $70,000
grant that funds The Link
wasn't renewed. When The Link
service, which is ordinarily sus-
pended in the summer, restarts
this fall, it's likely that most of
its route will be removed. Only
the eastern loop - which ser-
vices the University and Oxford
Housing - will remain.
But while the DDA cut fund-
ing for The Link, the AATA
announced on June 11 the for-
mation of a new commuter bus
route between Ann Arbor and
Canton Township. The route is
funded by a U.S. Department
of Transportation grant and
will open by late August. The
bus will be available for only
$125 per month. For University
employees, there's another perk
- the University will cover half
this cost.
While Ann Arbor is making
strides by adding the new com-

muter bus route to Canton, it's
also taking away busing options
within the city that residents
and students rely on. There is
no fare to use The Link buses,
making them the ideal trans-
portation option for Ann Arbor
residents and workers down-
town. For the University stu-
dents and staff that choose to
live in Kerrytown, The Link
ensures that travel around Ann
Arbor is an affordable option.
But the consequences of los-
ing The Link are more far-
reaching than just the cost for
passengers. Without the buses,
residents and workers down-
town will be forced to drive in
an already congested area. This
will increase street traffic and
strain on parking spaces. And
a good public transportation
system cuts down on air pol-
lution caused by cars. Cutting
bus routes like The Link that
help reduce pollution is coun-
ter-productive to the goal of an

environmentally-friendly trans-
portation network.
The new commuter bus route
to Canton is addressing all of
these problems on a larger,
regional scale. There are already
plenty of commuters on the
roads traveling to and from Ann
Arbor every day, contributing
to traffic, parking and pollution
problems. About 3,000 Univer-
sity employees live in Canton
and two of its neighboring cities,
Plymouth and Westland. With
the new bus route's fare being
offered at a low cost, getting to
Ann Arbor will be easier and
cheaper for these commuters.
There is no questionthatbuses
like the new commuter route to
Canton are good for the people,
the city and the environment
of Ann Arbor. The city should
give itself more mass transpor-
tation options by keeping The
Link's purple buses running
once students return for school
in the fall.

A kosher solution

CHRIS KOSLOWSKI I |OT TO PASTURE

E-MAIL CHRIS AT CSKOSLOW@UMICH.EDU

When it comes to the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, commen-
tary abounds on
the subject of
who is for and
against the idea
of a son-called
"two-state solu-
tion." President
Barack Obama -
is famously in MATTHEW
support of such GREEN
an agreement.
Meanwhile,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is almost as famously
opposed to it. Talking heads and
ideologues in both the western
and Muslim worlds argue the
point ad nauseum. They get caught
up in the argument and lose sight
of what really matters - how Pal-
estinians and Israelis actually feel
about it.
As reported by the Israeli news-
paper Haaretz, a recent study
conducted by the joint Israeli-Pal-
estinian pro-peace organization,
The OneVoice Movement, found
that 74 percent of Palestinians and
78 percent of Israelis favor a two-
state solution. By my rough calcu-
lation, this means that upward of
8.5 million people in the region
favor the idea of peace through
such means.
So what might happen if there
were a new sort of two-state solu-
tion, instead of a Jewish state and a
Palestinian state? What if one state
was for the 8.5 million people who
are optimistic about peace, while
the second was for the other guys to
duke it out amongthemselves. That
would throw the world for a loop.
The obviously bigger, more
forward-thinking state could call
itself "HolyLand" to cater to both
groups, while the other state could
call itself "SlowlyLand" - a tribute
to the mentality of its denizens.
HolyLand would attract millions
of tourists each year and invest in
the continued education and pro-
gressivism of its citizens, doing its
part to advance humanity. Slowly-
Land, however, mired in unending
civil war, would probably self-de-
struct. Or perhaps in close quar-
ters, SlowlyLanders might finally
realize that Israeli and Arab falafel
taste exactly the same.
Either way, after some amount of
time with this newstructure, those
who currently oppose a two-state
solution would no longer obstruct
the peace process. And at that time,
Arabs and Jews will have been liv-
ing side by side in HolyLand long
enough to know that the former

conflict was silly. Amen.
Call it infantile, trivial or
meshuggenah, but even this plan
makes a lot more sense than what-
ever Netanyahu has percolating in
his mind for the peace process.
Admittedly, just because people
like the way a two-state solution
sounds, they may be uncomfort-
able with letting their guard down
in the face of what they perceive as
terrorism or occupation. Moreover,
the OneVoice Movement's poll
didn't ask, "Would you mind living
next door to your historical ene-
mies or limiting the power of your
own cultural group in order to try
a new experiment for peace?" If it
had, the results probably wouldn't
bolster the partition of HolyLand
and SlowlyLand. Further, even
if there were two states in place,
immediate and unequivocal peace
wouldn't be expected.
Tired of war in
Israel? Avoid
SlowlyLand.
But even if two-state supporters
on both sides don't ever aggregate
in a new sort of fantastical country,
they ought to try harder to make
their voices heard. If Netanyahu
is strategically holding out before
accepting two states at some point
in the future, he may accept the
solution sooner if there's enough
pressure from within Israel.
It's apparent that the first step
in attaining peace involves Jew-
ish and Arab acceptance of each
other's existence. Israel isn't
going anywhere, and neither are
the West Bank and Gaza. The only
logical thing to do is to make both
places kosher, so to speak, in the
minds of both Jews and Arabs by
creating two separate, acknowl-
edged states.
An accord seems timelier now
than ever before. Israelis and Pal-
estinians favor a two-state solu-
tion in unprecedented numbers,
and the international excitement
of the Obama presidency, particu-
larly in the Muslim world, could
be a launching pad for meaningful
negotiation. Hawks on both sides
need to realize the importance of
the two-state solution and under-
stand that now is the time to strike
the penultimate lasting deal.

Addicted to aid

n Friday and Saturday,
the Detroit Free Press
published two conflict-
ing articles
about Michi-
gan's future.
Saturday's arti-
cle discussed
the $2 billion
in capital the
federal govern-
ment recently PATRICK
announced ZABAWA
it will give to
Michigan com-
munities (Biden announces $2B
bond program for Michigan public,
private sectors, 06/13/2009). But
Friday's was concerned with quite
the opposite - the lack of capital
available to Michigan businesses
(Michigan venture capital is in
short supply, 06/12/2009). These
articles paint a good picture of the
state of Michigan's economy: fail-
ing to attract growth while keep-
ing afloat on government lifelines.
But this kind of economy can't be
sustained. Relying on government
aid will keep our state's economy
stagnant, destroying job opportu-
nities for all of the state's residents
- including its college graduates.
The Saturday article discussed
a new federal program announced
by Vice PresidentJoe Biden in Kal-
amazoo on Friday. It would back
$2 billion in bonds for local com-
munities in Michigan, adding to
the billions in federal financial aid
the state has already received since
the economic crisis began. Michi-
gan received $7 billion in federal
stimulus money this year. Two
of its biggest companies - Gen-
eral Motors and Chrysler - were
recently bailed out by the feds.
Butwithallofthisfederalmoney
pouring into the state, firms are
somehow still having trouble get-
ting venture-capital money. The
Friday article quotes the Michi-
gan Venture Capital Association

as saying that over 300 companies
in the state are short on their ven-
ture-capital needs - by about $L3
billion in all.
The state's focus is clearly in the
wrong place.
There are many Michigan
residents who have realized this
and attempted to make the state
more attractive to businesses.
After at least 10 years of effort,
Michigan's Single Business Tax
was finally repealed by the state
legislature in 2007 - only to be
replaced by another business tax
that same year. Later in 2007, the
legislature added an additional
22-percent surcharge to this new
business tax.
Michigan's leaders haven't yet
gotten the message that business-
es are failing to invest in Michi-
gan. They continue to be obsessed
with the very aid that is preventing
business investment and growth
in the state.
Government aid isn't helping
Michigan residents in the first
place. Yes, many residents rely
on government aid for income
through unemployment benefits.
But they can only last so long. And
though the government increased
the length of the benefits, this
requires more taxes, creating an
even worse business climate in
the state.
Keeping the unemployed on
government aid so they'll be able
to feed themselves is a noble goal.
But it's also one that breeds more
unemployment. The unemployed
do not make any significant invest-
ments. They do not buy newhouses
or cars. Meanwhile, Detroit's auto-
makers' sales have nearly dropped
in half - resulting in more layoffs
in Michigan. And unemployment
aid doesn't do anything for recent
college graduates. Without having
ever had a full-time job, college
graduates are unable to receive a
temporary unemployment income

or join a health insurance plan for
laid-off workers.
Michigan needs a more busi-
ness-friendly environment so
those people can get jobs, not more
government aid. And the best way
to create this is to reduce the taxa-
tion businesses face.
Michigan
depends on the
feds too much.
Without such a tax burden,
Michigan would be better able to
keep its businesses from moving
out of state and would look more
attractive to businesses that may
want to move here. It would allow
businesses here to keep more of
their own money and invest it in
their own expansion - contrib-
uting to Michigan's economy and
job growth.
Michiganworkers whoseunem-
ployment benefits have run out
and those who never held a full-
time job would all benefit from
policies that encourage Michigan
businesses to grow. And with the
new job opportunities, many of
the unemployed wouldn't need the
government aid provided to them.
As the economy continues to
weaken, Michigan lawmakers will
continue to facetough decisions on
the state's budget. Michigan vot-
ers, too, will have to make tough
decisions as they choose public
policies to endorse. Hopefully
they'll choose the path that leads
to economic growth in the state,
instead of one thatkeeps Michigan
residents out of work.

STREET FAIR
From Page 1
year's 174. Brown attributed the
decrease in to a decline in the num-
ber of artist applications and fewer
invitations to artists from the fair's
organizers.
Brown said the budget decrease
is unprecedented because the fair's
organizers have reported budget
growth each year since relocating to
the Burton Tower area in 2003. The
fair has retained an average budget
of $370,000 in past years.
Brown and the fair's organiz-
ers have been trying to generate
new revenue and cut nonessential
expenses in order to repair the bud-
get hole.
Expenses that were cut are based
on responses in surveys given to
past performers and patrons, rang-
ing from services for artists to entire
workshop events at the fair.
"We look at the surveys to see
which workshops are the least
important and have low attendance,

and those ones are vulnerable,"
Brown said, adding that artist ser-
vices like free drinking water were
eliminated using surveys given to
artists only.
Amid the expense cuts, Brown
said the fair's daily music and art
performances are receiving com-
paratively few cuts, since fair offi-
cials want to continue offering
compensation to the performers for
their work.
Fair officials are also calling on
community members to help repair
the budget, which does not neces-
sarily entail donating money.
"They can help just by volun-
teering. They can get an inside
look at the fair this way," Brown
said, adding that potential volun-
teers and donors should consider
the fair's consistently invigorating
impact on the local economy.
Brown said that this is the first
time in 50 years that fair organiz-
ers have looked to the community
for help - though fair organizers
always accept donations at booths
during the fair.

In addition to charity from the
community, Karen Delhey, part-
nership and marketing director
of the Ann Arbor Street Fair, has
been trying to generate revenue by
putting together custom advertis-
ing packages for local businesses.
"In lieu of national corporate
tours, we figured we could take
advantage of this and work with
more regional and local compa-
nies and offer them packages," she
said.
A few regional businesses that
have accepted such offers to join
the fair this year include Fire-
Keepers Casino in Battle Creek,
Wow Green (a manufacturer of
eco-friendly cleaning products in
Southfield) and Relax The Back,
a distributor of massage products
and ergonomic furniture based out
of Northville.
Whilebusinesses previouslypar-
ticipated for the entire fair, Delhey
said they're now able to make safer
investments by appearing only one
or two days out of the four.
Several local businesses are also
involved with the Art Fair Town-
ie Street Party kickoff event,
which includes music, a beer and
wine tent and a kids' art fair held
the Monday night before the Ann
Arbor Street Art Fair.
The Townie Street Party has
consistently been a financial suc-
cess in previous years, and fair
officials expect to repeat strong
attendance this year.
"The question people have
been asking is, 'Are you going
out of business?' and the answer
is a resounding no," Brown said.
"We're trying to do the best we
can to be creative and resource-
ful."
"We're going to be fine, but we
want to be fine for the next 50
years," she said.

SHAMAN DRUM

but in effect what it does is it's go-
ing to drive out all of the businesses
around the University that special-
ize in textbooks," Pohrt said Friday.
He added that the book indus-
try is going through a digitalization
revolution and that the University
will be at the forefront of it.
"That's the way that history's
tipping," Port said, adding that the
last major revolution in the liter-
ary world was the invention of the
printing press.
Pohrt said that electronic books
will be part of the digitalization
movement, which will completely
change the textbook industry.
"What's looming on the hori-
zon is the rise of electronic books,"
he said. "I think those are going to
especially impact the textbook in-
dustry."
Though the direction ofthe book
industry is not promising for inde-
pendent booksellers, Pohrt said he
was not spiteful of the new technol-
ogy.
"I'm not particularly bitter about
all of this," Pohrt said, adding that
he thought electronic books would
be much easier for students to car-
ry.
LSA senior Torrance Laury said
he was disappointed to hear that
Shaman Drum was closing.
"It's pretty disappointing to
hear," Laury said. "I bought a few
books there, but I know they also
sold a lot of books for leisure read-
ing, and they've been around a long

time."
LSA senior Olivia Both also la-
mented the closing of Shaman
Drum, stating that she prefers to
buy most of her books there.
"That's where I get all my books
from," Both said. "I feel like they're
always so helpful there. I've always
appreciated it.'
In an effort to continue the
legacy of his bookshop, Pohrt ap-
plied for nonprofit status with the
IRS over a year ago and planned to
create a center for the literary arts
- called the Great Lakes Literary
Arts Center - that could receive
tax-deductible donations and gov-
ernment grants.
"The question is,'What does the
bookshop of the future look likeT'
and that's a really interesting ques-
tion," Pohrt said. "I hope a way to
explore that question is with the
GLLAC."
Pohrt said he hopes to come up
with a solution to help the failing
independent bookshop industry in
the city within the next six months.
"I've done my best to be a com-
munity bookshop and a community
resource, and it doesn't work right
now" Pohrt said. "I don't know how
to fix this, but maybe I'll have a bet-
ter idea about that six months from
now, or if other people are drawn to
answer that with me."
Pohrt wrote that he was grateful
to have 28 good years of business
out of Shaman Drum's 29-year run
and thanked the community for its
support.
"I'm very grateful for the opportu-
nity to be a bookseller in Ann Ar-
bor," Pohrt wrote.

Blockbuster remake falls short

Solid acting from John Travolta and
Denzel Washington can't save this
dead-on-the-water film
By HANS YADAV
Daily Arts Writer
"The Taking of Pelham 123," the remake of director Joseph
Sargent's 1974 classic, recycles all the ingenuity of the original
and offers nothing new to modern audiences.
The newly released "Pelham" is a trainwreck
of inconsistency and inadequacy.
Walter Garber (Denzel Washington,
"American Gangster") is a New York sub- The Taking
way dispatcher who notices that one of the of Pelham
trains, Pelham 123, has mysteriously stopped 123
en route. As it turns out, a man known only
as Ryder (John Travolta, "Wild Hogs") has At Quality16
hijacked the train and is demanding ransom and Showcase
money in exchange for his hostages' safety. Columbia
The plot of this version of "Pelham" stays
fairly true to its 1974 counterpart with, of
course, a 2009 touch-up. Streaming video over the internet,
GPS and other modern gadgets and technologies allow a more
contemporary audience to better appreciate and connect with
the remake.
But the movie does so many other things wrong that mak-
ing an overall connection is impossible. Thebiggest gripe about

"Pelham" is how misguided it feels.
The tempo of the movie flip-flops
between high-paced action scenes
and moments of very slow dialogue.
One scene hasblaring police cars rac-
ing through the streets of New York
while the next has a philosophical dis-
cussion between Ryder and Garber.
Whether or notthe suspense is meant
to be building during these slow
points remains a mystery because,
simply put, the film's production is
poorly executed.
The most annoying examples of
production gone wrong are the high-
octane sessions that are purposely
shot in blurry slow motion. With this
technique, any chance of adrenaline "OK, which one of you said
is immediately killed. Ultimately, the
audience is stuck in a semi-energized state throughout the
whole film.
The action in "Pelham" is OK, but certainly nothing awe-
inspiring. There are the typical exploding cars and shootouts,
but not much else. Another problem with "Pelham" is that
it suffers from a bad case of mediocrity. It does enough to get
by, and that's pretty much it. With no crazy special effects,
plot twists or surprises, "Pelham" really only appeals to those
already familiar with the older version of the movie.
One of the few good things about the film is its acting. Tra-
volta and Washington are both convincing enough so as not to

'Wild Hogs' sucked?"
create another problematic distraction. Travolta may actually
beat out Washington in terms of what he brings to his respec-
tive character. Washington is always solid, but Travolta adds a
sense of realness to Ryder. Ryder displays logical inconsisten-
cies, frequent profanity and deceptive moral alignment, traits
that are so familiar with reality. Ryder is notthe typical master-
mind, and that's more than fine.
Remakes of classic movies rarely ever succeed in bringing any-
thing new to the table, and "Pelham" is no exception. With sub-par
action, incongruous tempo and zero ingenuity, the film is doomed
to be one long, bumpy ride.

'Girlfriend' turns more than tricks

. By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
There is a scene in the obnoxiously cute-
sy 2005 romantic comedy "Hitch" where
Will Smith's wholesome
"love doctor" character
is approached by a sleazy
client who wants help get- The

not meaningless sexual
affairs. In the world of
film, as in the real world of public con-
sciousness, there is a very distinct ethical
and emotional line between these two types
of male-female interactions.
"The Girlfriend Experience" exploits -
and at times silently mocks - this entire
idea. Here is a film that views prostitution
simply as a business, a means to an eco-
nomic end that can exist side-by-side with
an actual, committed relationship. The
main character, Chelsea (real-life porn star
Sasha Grey, whose IMDB credits include
films like "Sasha Grey's Anatomy"), is a suc-
cessful New York escort. Though Chelsea
never explicitly states how she bills herself
to her clients, it's implied that her appeal
to them lies in something more than sex:

They pay her for providing companionship
and inspiring confidence. One takes her to a
movie, then awkwardly tries to discuss the
film with her afterward. Others just want to
talk about their failing jobs and/or failing
marriages.
So Chelsea's allure must be that she gives
lonely men "the girlfriend experience" for
a price. The fascination of the film is that
her character is also a full-time girlfriend:
She's in a long-term relationship with Chris
(relative newcomer Chris Santos), an ath-
letic trainer. Chris is somehow OK with her
line of work, but when Chelsea decides to go
on a weekend getaway with a married man
she's just met, Chris draws his line between
cheating and business-as-usual.
Why is this? Perhaps it's because she's
going with the intention of looking for
something greater than a hooker-client
relationship. After all, intention becomes
everything when all the other elements of
a relationship can be bought and sold. Per-
haps the emotionally detached Chelsea has
lost the ability to connect with people on a
meaningful level, and perhaps Chris and all
her clients have, too, because they believed
in the healing power of artificial connec-
tions.
This all sounds like yet another tale about
a hooker's inner turmoil. But director Ste-
ven Soderbergh ("Che"), using the barely-
there filmmaking style he last showcased in
"Bubble," is interested in something deeper.

"Man, it's really acid out today."
His cast is made up of non-actors, and his
unmoving camera captures their discom-
fort and vulnerability as they stumble over
each other's (mostly improvised) lines.
Soderbergh also overlaps conversations

CONSECUTIVE
CHAMPIONS

BETH HALL/AP
Senior Geena Gall celebrates after her second consecutive National Championship
in the 800-meter race this weekend. Michigan finished seventh in the nation.

Seniors Ofili and Gall
grab consecutive
national titles
By FELIX CARREON
Daily Sports Writer
Seniors and co-captains Tiffany
Ofili and Geena Gall capped their
collegiate careers with a pair of
individual NCAA titles this week-
end, helping the Wolverines grab a
seventh place national finish.
The duo will likely be remem-
bered as two of the best athletes in
the history of the Michigan wom-
en's track and field team. But the
seniors' relationship started before
they ever wore the maize and blue.
As high school seniors, Gall and
Ofili were members of the same
track club that competed at the
2005 Nike Indoor National Meet in
Landover, Md. To get to know one
another better, the members of the

team asked each other's goals for
the meet. Gall told Ofili that all she
wanted was to win.
"This girl is very confident," Ofili
told herself. "Who is this girl? I
was really surprised by it because I
wasn't expecting that answer."
The next day, Ofili watched
as Gall earned a second straight
national title in the 800-meter run
in record-setting fashion.
And this past weekend, the two's
journey reached its climax during
the NCAA Championships in Fay-
etteville, Ark.
As Ofili approached the finish
line of the 100-meter hurdles final,
the usually reserved senior starting
celebrating with a sizable lead over
the rest of the field. The celebration
was almost enough to knock the
pink shades off of her face.
The victory marked Ofili's third
NCAA title in the event and fifth
overall counting the Ypsilanti's
native winsinthe 60-meterhurdles.

CHAMPS

Ofili's efforts were enough
to cement her as one of the best
athletes in the history of the pro-
gram. But Michigan's superstar
hurdler first turned heads as just
a freshman. In her first year with
the Wolverines, Ofili broke school
records in both the 60- and 100-
meter hurdles.
This season, Ofili has made
a name for herself as one of the
world's best in the 100-meter hur-
dles, her signature event. At the
renowned Drake Relays, which
hosts some of the world's top tal-
ent, Ofili stood at the start as the
only collegian. After the race, she
stood as the victor, running past
the professional competition and
earning Athlete of the Meet acco-
lades.
Ofili's body of work suggests
that she could be considered one
of the most dominant athletes ever
to wear the block M in any Michi-
gan varsity sport. To win only one
national title is difficult, but to win
five in asport where one hundredth
of a second often determines the
winner is simply unprecedented.
Michigan coach James Henry
decided to honor Ofili's accom-

plishments by naming an award
after her. The Tiffany Ofili Award
will be given to any Wolverine who
wins an NCAA title, and it's only
fitting that the first recipient of
the award was her roommate and
teammate since their first meeting
in 2005, Gall.
Gall registered her second con-
secutive 800-meter NCAA crown
this weekend in an unfamiliar
fashion. The Grand Blanc native
took to the front of the pack and
crossed the 200-meter mark in a
blistering 28 seconds. The Big Ten
Athlete of the Year led wire-to-
wire, aiming to break the coveted
two-minute mark in the event.
"Geena is going to do whatever
it takes to win," Ofili said. "I knew
that if it took taking the lead from
the beginningto win the race, then
Geena was going to do it. I wasn't
surprised by that."
Michigan has a history of excel-
lent middle-distance runners,
and Gall is the recent product of
assistant coach Mark McGuire's
instruction. During her first two
years at the University, Gall had
the luxury of training with Katie
Erdman, an eight-time All-Amer-
ican under McGuire.
And with Gall's career coming
to a close, she leaves Ann Arbor
