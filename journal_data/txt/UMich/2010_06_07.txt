TEACH FOR AMERICA
Education
majors not
TFA target
Four percent of new
corps members have
education background
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
As Teach for America welcomes its
largest incoming corps, its prospec-
tive members are finding an alterna-
tive pathway to the field of education.
Though the TFA members will be
working as teachers in urban and rural
schools, the majority of the corps does
not have a background in education.
Instead, for some of the more than
4,500 new corps members, the orga-
nization is used as a stepping-stone for
careers in other diverse fields.
Teach for America is a non-profit
organization, in which recent college
graduates apply to teach for two years
in often low-income school districts.
With 46,000 applications received
this year and a 12-percent admission
rate, this year's TFA members came
through the most selective applica-
tion process in the organization's his-
tory, according to a Teach for America
press release.
According to a spokesperson from
TFA, the most common undergradu-
ate majors for the incoming members
are social sciences. Following the
34 percent of corps members in that
field, the most common majors were
government or public policy, math,
sciences and engineering. Approxi-
mately four percent of the new corps
members majored in education.
Deborah Ball, dean of the School of
Education, said that though TFA devi-

Varying accounts given
for Hearing Cmte.'s
vote on Borisov report
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
Members of a sub-committee of
the University's leading faculty gov-
ernance body are at odds with each
other after questions were raised
about a report that may or may not
have been formally approved by the
committee earlier this year.

The controversy involving the
Faculty Hearing Committee of the
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs centers around a
report meant to investigate a situ-
ation between University adminis-
trators and a former medical school
researcher, Andrei Borisov.
According to the FHC's report,
Borisov was forced to resign by
his department chair in a meeting
where University Police were pres-
ent. That incident came after Borisov
alleged scientific misconduct against
a fellow researcher. The report states
the situation escalated to the point
where University Police injured Bor-

isovand arrestedhim fortrespassing
in his office.
And while the FHC's report
does exist and does recount many
of the events surrounding Borisov's
ultimate dismissal from the Univer-
sity, there is disagreement within
the three-person committee over
whether the report was ever accept-
ed by the committee in a final form.
At the center of the controversy
is an argument between Engineer-
ing Prof. Wayne Stark, chairman of
the committee at the time the report
was produced, and Statistics Prof. Ed
Rothman, who served on the com-

BP oil spill could leave
lasting damage in Gulf,
University experts say
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Despite the distance between Ann
Arbor and the Gulf of Mexico, Univer-
sity professors and researchers have
begun to address the complex task of
exploring the ecological, legal, and
business repercussions of the British
Petroleum oil spill.
Gerald Meyers, a University Orga-
nization and Management professor,
said unlike previous oil spills such as
the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska
- which had a fairly successful cleanup
- the current flow of oil from the BP oil
rig will permanently change the eco-
systems of the Gulf Coast.
"This one's more than just a spill,"
he said.
Meyers added that natural meth-
ods of degradation will begin to break
down the spill regardless of the reac-
tionary measures of BP and the gov-
ernment, but these naturally occurring
processes still leave much work for the
nation's engineers and researchers.
"This is a national emergency
that is seriously affecting the lives of
thousands of citizens," Meyers said.
"Human life is not involved here, but
human existence is."
Peter Adriaens, a University Envi-
ronmental Engineering professor, has
served as a consultant on cleanups of
Ihe Fpop VaJdez atdG.Qulf War o.

spills, and said one of the greatest chal-
lenges of the cleanup will be convinc-
ing residents that returning the site to
a "pristine condition" is a negotiated
circumstance.
Adriaens said following any oil spill,
the first thing to occur is the evapo-
ration of lighter compounds of oil,
leaving behind only the heavier com-
ponents, which BP and the govern-
ment are currently working to contain
and hopefully eliminate.
But even the 1967 oil spill from the
Torrey Canyon tanker, considered the
world's first major oil spill, left rem-
nants of crude oil that are still being
found today, Adriaens said.
While the United States has taken
initiative in returning disaster sites
to their original states, establishing
programs such as the Environmental
Protection Agency Superfund, Adri-
aens said it is impossible to completely
remove all traces of contamination
after such a disaster.
Even advanced methods, like
the "top kill" - which was recently
attempted by BP to plug the flow from
the well with more than two million
gallons of a mud-like substance and
cement - have been proven failures.
While this precarious method did
not succeed in stopping the spills, BP
is now attempting to use the Lower
Marine Riser Package, which entails
removing the defective riser cap of the
pipe and replacing it with a new cap, as
reported by CNN.
According to another report by
CNN, the new cap has allowed BP to
successfully funnel approximately

MABEL project
replicates human
locomotion
By TOREHAN SHARMAN
For the Daily
When Engineering professor Jessy
Grizzle first began the MABEL proj-
ect in 2004, his intention was to use
the bipedal robot as a platform to run
computer software. Since then, Griz-
zle said the robot has become more
than just a mere platform.
With the ability to stand on two
feet and move with external com-
mand, MABEL is one of the first
robots capable of navigating through
uneven terrain, Grizzle said.
In one demonstration, MABEL
walked around its support pylon in
a cyclical motion. To display its abil-
ity to respond to non-flat terrain,
Koushil Sreenath and Hae Won Park
- two Rackham students working
with Grizzle on the project - placed
a one-inch board in its path. MABEL
stepped over the board and contin-
ued walking while Park and Sreenath
continued placing additional boards
in its path until the robot eventually
stumbled and was forced to recover.
Grizzle said unlike other bipedal
robots, MABEL is able to respond
to uneven terrain without the help
of a camera. He added that his team
avoided implementing computer-
based vision in MABEL to more
closely emulate improvisational
human behavior.
"The key feature is that MABEL
has no camera and no visual sensors,"
Park said. "It is like a human walking
on rough ground blind."
Sreenath said the mechanical
aspects of MABEL have been mod-
eled after human anatomy where
the springs in the robot's legs are
analogous to tendons that absorb
force. Members of the team said they

treads rough terrain.

worked closely with the School of
Knesiology to properly replicate the
motion of the human legs.
"The tendons store energy so
when the ground varies, the energy
is stored in the tendons," Sreenath
said. "Equivalently, on MABEL we
have springs ... they compress to store
energy so when the ground level
changes, the energy does not propa-
gate throughout the system."
Grizzle said the team's goal is to
use MABEL to experiment on vari-
ous algorithms that will help emulate
human-like locomotion. He said they
would like to look at what processes
allow the human body to stay upright
and move and translate them into an
energy-efficient robot.
Despite the progress that has been
made on MABEL, Grizzle said the
project did not start out smoothly and
when Sreenath and Park joined the
team in 2007, MABEL was nowhere
near operational. The team spent one
year buildingthe robot, which he said
hindered the progress of Sreenath
and Pak's Ph.D. work,
"In the beginning, (Sreenath and
Park) spent the first year of their
Ph.D. work doing nothing but build-
ing a robot," Grizzle said. "When it
comes to a Ph.D. defense, that counts
for zero ... you've got to have results,"
Having recently overcome many of
the setbacks that plagued MABEL's
construction, Sreenath said the team
is now working on ways to improve
the robot's functionality.
With an electrical engineering
background, Sreenath said he is con-
centrating on the electrical and con-
trol systems of MABEL and is looking
to improve the accuracy of MABEL
when it recalculates environmental
factors like the coefficient of friction
of the surface on which it is walking.
As a bipedal robot, MABEL is cur-
rently only able to walk. Park, who
has a mechanical engineering back-
ground, said lie hopes to eventually
be able to increase MABEL's walking
speed and overcome the challenge
of bringing both of the robot's legs
off the ground simultaneously. The
result, he said, could be MABEL mov-
ing from a walk to a run.

FHC REPORT
From Page 1
mittee at the time and now serves as
the chair of SACUA.
In interviews with The Michi-
gan Daily, Stark said the report was
formally adopted by the FHC while
Rothman said that only Stark had
voted to move the report forward and
the two other committee members
opposed such action.
In a signed affidavit sent to the
Daily, Rothman and Architecture
Prof. Mojtaba Navvab, the third
member of the FHC, swore that at
no point in time did they ever vote to
formally adopt the final report of the
FHC on the Borisov case.
"As two of the three members of
the 2009-2010 SACUA Faculty Hear-
ing Committee, we state that at no
time did we endorse in final form any
version of the FHC report in the case
of Dr. Borisov and, therefore, there
was no such report ever endorsed by
a majority of the FHC," the affidavit
states.
However, in a letter to Rothman
accompanied by e-mail records,
OIL SPILL
From Page 2
441,000 gallons of oil to the water's
surface, however, many believe that
these efforts pale in comparison to the
approximately 798,000 gallons of oil
that are currently spilling each day.
BP's next initiative in the efforts
entails removing the remaining oil
that has surfaced alongthe Gulf, which
will be accomplished through the con-
struction of relief wells.
University professors and research-
ers such as David Uhlmann, the direc-
tor of the Environmental Law and
Policy Program at the Law School, are
not only investigating the ecological
damages, but also the legal and busi-

Stark wrote that Navvab did vote to
approve the FHC report.
"I disagree with your statement
that there is no final SACUA Faculty
Hearing Committee (FHC) Report,"
Stark wrote in his letter to Roth-
man. "I find the events you describe
regarding the operation of the Facul-
ty Hearing Committee to be incom-
plete and the logic used to draw your
conclusions to be faulty."
"Last Friday, you told me on the
phone you approved the report of the
FHC," Stark added in an e-mail con-
versation to Navvab, then continu-
ing in his e-mail to outline additions
to the report he had made since the
vote.
In his response, Navvab said he
agreed with the additions Stark had
made, though Navvab did not explic-
itly reaffirm or counter his alleged
support for the final report as a
whole.
Navvab, who was traveling last
week, did not respond to an e-mail
request for comment.
Stark's letter continued to detail
what he alleges to have happened,
including a unanimous vote by the
FHC to adopt a draft of the report
ness ramifications that BP will face in
light of the seemingly limitless after-
math.
"BP and the other companies
involved in the Gulf oil spill face sig-
nificant criminal and civil penalties,"
Uhlmann said. "Exxon paid a total of
$1.1 billion for the Valdez spill, and the
penalties in the BP case are likely to be
even larger."
Uhlmann, who also served as the
chief of the Department of Justice's
environmental crimes section dur-
ing the Clinton and George W. Bush
administrations for seven years, added
that an earlier response to the spill
could have helped reduce the ramifica-
tions.
"In hindsight, it might have been
better if the government did more in

and a 2-1 vote to accept the final
report, which did not receive support
in a SACUA-wide vote.
"The fact that SACUA voted
against SACUA accepting the report
on April 19, 2010 does not change the
Faculty Hearing Committee's vote,"
Stark wrote.
He added, "Because a member of
the FHC voted to approve the final
report as a FHC report does not mean
they will necessarily vote to have it
accepted as a SACUA report."
Stark's comment refers to what he
said was a change in position by one
FHC member who allegedly voted
for the report in the FHC, but voted
against it in SACUA's vote.
Stark also alleges that the record-
ed tally of the SACUA vote, reported
in the group's April 19, 2010 minutes
as 5-1 not to accept the report, is
inaccurate and that in actuality two
people voted to approve the report.
Stark told the Daily that SACUA
voted in executive session 5-2 not to
accept the report. However, Stark
said he had to leave to catch a flight

those at the meeting that he wanted
his vote to be in support of the report
and that his vote should have been
recorded as such.
Asked about the SACUA vote,
Rothman said he couldn't com-
ment on whether the vote count was
accurate, but said that the vote was
recorded by the other person Stark
believed was supporting the report.
All votes of SACUA are recorded by
the SACUA secretary, who at the
time was Biology Prof. John Lehman.
In either case of a 5-1 or 5-2 vote,
the motion not to accept the report
would still have carried. What
remains unclear is why the report
was sent to SACUA if it was never ini-
tially approved by the FHC.
According to Rothman, the report
was sent to SACUA against parlia-
mentary procedures used in bod-
ies like the United States House of
Representatives and Senate because
SACUA is a small body and many
members were already aware of
much of the committee's work and
had an interest in reviewing the

issues.
And while disagreement contin-
ues over whether a formal report
was ever adopted by the FHC, which
would end the committee's work on
the case, both sides say they agree
that Borisov deserves a response to
his claim filed with the Faculty Hear-
ing Committee.
"As I've promised the members of
SACUA, I won't rest until we getsome
resolution to the issues that surround
this," Rothman said in an interview
Friday, adding that Borisov's litiga-
tion against the University doesn't
make the process of resolving the
issue internally easy.
Similarly, Stark said he believed
Borisov deserves closure on this
issue, which Stark said was supposed
to be brought out in the formalized
FHC report.
"Dr. Borisov deserves some type of
answer from faculty governance as to
what it found," Stark said. Stark also
said he thinks it's interesting that no
one is questioning the facts of the
report.

before the group came back into open
session and re-voted on the issue.
Nonetheless, Stark said he informed
the early days to contain the spill and
limit its effects, rather than relying
so much on BP to lead the emergency
response, but crisis management is
never perfect," he said.
Though research is being done on a
global scale in attempt to resolve the
effects of the spill, there are few defi-
nite answers about the region's future
in the underwater ecosystems and
within populated communities.
Uhlmann added that BP faces an
uncertain future as well.
"It is not clear how successful a
company BP will be after the oil spill
is resolved," Uhlmann said. "But
there is no question that there will be
dramatic consequences for BP, which
will weaken the company for many
years."

'U' president shouldn't have power to dismiss complaints
The DPS Oversight Committee can't seem to catch a break. After
finally achieving proper representation, it received yet another
blow to its ability to investigate Department of Public Safety mis-
conduct when the University president was made arbiter of the validity of
complaints. This veto power is a clear and shameful conflict of interest, as
well as an attack on the spirit of the state law which established DPS and
its oversight committee in the first place. If the University wants DPS to
have any semblance of legitimacy as a protective body, it must ensure that
it has a robust and independent oversight committee.

Nearly 13,000 undergraduate and
graduate students, as well as families
of students, live in campus housing
provided by the University. In popu-
lation and infrastructure, University
Housing represents a small residential
city comprising nearly 5 million square
feet, including 16 residence halls, 1480
apartment units and a cooperative
house, plus seven dining halls and sev-
eral residential cafes. Next fall, we'll
open the first new residence hall in
more than 40 years: the North Quad-
rangle Residential and Academic Com-
plex. Add a new dining hall to that, too.
The residential experience for the
University is far more than the provi-
sion of spaces for sleeping and eating.
It is the commitment to welcoming,
safe, diverse communities that sup-
port and develop students' academic,
social and intellectual capabilities,
preparing them to pursue life with
passion, dignity and purpose. The
facilities, services and programs
behind that commitment require tre-
mendous resources, responsibility
and undertaking.
It requires a regular employee base
of approximately 650 skilled and
dedicated people to operate and sus-
tain this campus city - in facilities
maintenance, food services, resident
services and support, security, room
assignments and contracts, student
accounts, technology and network
services, planning and design, park-
ing and grounds, administrative and
business services. And throughout
its operations, University Housing
employs nearly 2,000 students annu-
ally for vital support in residential
services and programs. Housing's
total compensation to student staff
this year is approximately $7.5 million
- helping many finance their Michi-
gan education.
University Housing is a self-frnded
auxiliary trait within tire Division osf
Student Affairs. Housing receives no
revenue from tuition or state funding.
Practically all its operating revenue is
derived from student room and board
and apartment rental fees, making
cperating budget and rates completely
intercornnected. Cosnsequently, each
year as we examine the costs of Hous-
ing operations and develop budgets for
the next fiscal year, we must be good
stewards of our students' resources,
specifically their room and board fees
and their Northwood Community
Apartment rent fees.
With the participation of residen-
tial students, we have worked dili-
gently over the past years to reduce
operating expenses in order to rec-
ommend frugal room and board
rates, without sacrificing key servic-
es and programs for the residential

experience. Since fiscal year 2006,
University Housing has achieved $7.9
million in cost reductions that have
helped keep room and board rates as
low as possible.
This year, the Board of Regents
approved a room and board average
rate increase of three percent for aca-
demic year 2010-2011, of which one
percent would support higher operat-
ing expenses. The approved average
increase in rental rates for Northwood
Community Apartments is one percent
to meet projected operating expenses.
The increase in operating expenses for
both residence halls and apartments
was partially offset by more than $1.7
million in cost containment efforts for
fiscal year 2011.
The additional two percent increase
in residence hall room and board rates
will continue the capital improve-
ments of the Residential Life Initia-
tives, the planned capital program
launched in 2003 to improve U-M's
residential facilities.
Aging facilities have been revital-
ized and made safer and more com-
fortable for our students. Improved
spaces for study and community
experiences within Mosher-Jordan
and Stockwell halls have facilitated
our efforts to strengthen the connec-
tion between living and learning. The
Hill Dining Center has added a new
dimension to our campus food servic-
es. And to all of these improvements
and more, the student response has
been enthusiastic.
Yet, even as we move rapidly toward
the opening of the new North Quad
and the renovations to Couzens Hall,
there are other student residences in
need of improvements. Our campus
residences are of wide ranging sizes,
designs and ages: from Helen Newber-
ry Residence, built in 1915 and home
to 110 omenr, ts ursley Hail built in
1967 fosr 124t0 ment rod womn. Infra-
structure renewal - plumbing, wiring,
heating, floors to roofs - is an ongoing
capital need throughout most of our
hails and apartments.
Stewardship is the underlying prin-
cipletthat gides University Housing
and the Division osf Studenrt Affairs
in our recommendation of room and
board and apartment rental rates.
Specifically, it's a fine balance in stew-
ardship of facilities, programs and
student dollars. By carefully manag-
ing our operations and budgets, we
have been able to offer cost-efficient
rates that effectively sustain our facil-
ities and services and provide com-
munities that have purpose and value
for our students.
E. Royster Harper is the Vice
President for Student Affairs.

In February, the appeal pro-
cess for complaints heard by the
DPS Oversight Committee was
revised. Previously, ifthe director
of DPS objected to the hearing,
he could appeal to the executive
vice president. If that person sup-
ported the appeal, it would be
sent to the president, who would
then ask the Board of Regents for
a final decision on whether the
complaint lay within the jurisdic-
tion of the committee. Under the
new rules, the Board of Regents is
taken out of the equation and the
president is given the duthority to
dismiss complaints.
The effect of this rule change
is evident in the recent case of Dr.
Andrei Borisov. After clear mis-
conduct by DPS officers, Borisov
filed a complaint with the DPS
Oversight Committee. This is
undoubtedly a case that calls for
an in-depth, transparent investi-
gation. But such an investigation
is jeopardized by the president's
power to dismiss the complaint

as outside the jurisdiction of the
committee. University President
Marc Sue Coleman should allow
the hearigs to proceed, lest the
administration cast another dark
shadow upon the events sur-
rounding Borisov's termination.
But this situation demonstrates
a lesson that should have been
learned in highcschool civics- the
need for checks and balances. Any
entity with power over a group
of people must have legitimate,
independent oversight to ensure
that it stays within the limits of its
authority. Making the president
the judge of a complaint's valid-
ity willfully ignores this reality.
Instead, an unalienable conflict
of interest has been created, as it
is always against the immediate
interest of the University for DPS
misconduct to be publicized. The
opaque veil of secrecy that seems
to encapsulate the University and
DPS bureaucracy has been fur-
ther entrenched by this change.
The DPS Oversight Commit-

tee should be the sole arbiter of
whether DPS acted inappropri-
ately. In order for the commit-
tee to do its job properly, it must
be insulated from pressure by'
administrators, who will always
claim that DPS is acting prop-
erly to protect the University's
public image. Allowing anyone
in the administration to have the
authority to dismiss complaints
against DPS mares the commit-
tee less of an independent over-
seeing body and more of a way to
quietly sweep wrongdoing under
the rug. Even giving the Board
of Regents the final decision pro-
vides too much of an opportunity
for administrators to exert their
influence. The committee must
operate as a fully empowered and
independent entity.
The DPS Oversight Committee
is the only reason that DPS can be
called a legal, legitimate, protec-
tive force. But in light of recent
events, that portrayal is becoming
harder to believe.

Postcards from NJ

BRUNO STORTINI

E-MAIL BRUNOAT BRUNORS@UMICH.EDU.

I'm beginning to feel home-
sick already. Not homesick
for Ann Arbor, where I spent
the past year making some of the
best friends I've
ever made, but
homesick for
New Jersey, my
home state and
current place of
residence. Even
though sum-
mer has only ANNA
just begun, I'm PAONE
already dread-
ing going back to
school in September. Sure, it'll be
nice to see my friends again and
be a pro-life scourge to the mass-
es. But, for now, I'm really enjoy-
ing blending into the crowd of my
small suburb, spending lazy hours
writing my novel and hanging out
with my family, who are an excel-
lent example of how people can
love each other even when they
have wildly divergent viewpoints.
(Imagine living in "Family Ties.")
My homesickness has con-
tributed more than once to the
thought of transferring. You can
imagine the "Catholic indecision"
that contributes to such impor-
tant undertakings. First, you have
to do the regular, secular thing:
make your list of pros and cons,
ponder it and talk to people. Then
you have to do the Catholic thing:
pray about it and bring it to Jesus.
Then you think about it some
more.
The next day, you say, "Jesus, I
really don't want to rush you, but
realistically these schools have
transfer deadlines." Finally, you
pretend that you've already made
your decision and see if that helps
you envision what the right choice
is. Then, if you make the wrong
choice, you say, "God wanted me
to make this mistake so I would
have a life experience."
I'm not even being that sar-
castic. This is pretty much the
thought process driving my recent
decision to switch from a Biblical
Studies concentration to a double
major in English and Screen Arts
and Cultures and stay at the Uni-
versity, at least for now.
The recent influx of New Jer-
sey-themed television shows and
seeing my Garden State friends
have made me think about my
home state in a new way. If you
saw my last column, you know
that I'm too busy obsessing over
"24" to find time to watch "Jersey
Shore" or any of its silly-looking
relatives. But a gap-year trip to
Belgium and my subsequent life

in Ann Arbor have given me a new
appreciation for my own inner
-New Jerseyan. After all, stereo-
typically speaking, the New York
metropolitan area is the center of
the world, especially in the eyes of
its denizens.
But at the same time, to those of
us who grew up in this area, it can
also justbe home, and the only rea-
son it's more enjoyable than Ann
Arbor or even Michigan in general
is because our pizza is infinitely
more delicious. I've learned not
to fall into the same stereotyping
that says the Midwest is one end-
less prairie of uncultured towns
- and, in a much more important
way, I've learned so much about
other ways of thinking and modes
of life, Protestantism in particu-
lar. Coming from a solidly secu-
lar Catholic and Jewish area, it's
both enlightening and necessary
to meet people who worship in a
similar vein but with a different
doctrine than my recently Catho-
lic self.
I'm already
dreading going
back in the fall.
For a long time, I was dogged
by the specter of not having a cul-
ture or background. Of course,
my discovery of religion helped a
lot with that, but going to school
out-of-state has made me realize,
as folk singer Dar Williams put
it, "I finally think I come from
someplace." As a not-very-Italian,
Italian-American who never had a
sense of her heritage, I'm finding
myself by both living in a place
much different from Jersey (to the
tune of $40,000 a year) and learn-
ing about people in a way that will
come in handy when I write nov-
els or make philosophical argu-
ments. And when I come home to
the Northeast and re-assimilate in
all ways but my politics, I remem-
ber my friends - Catholic, pro-
life, and those who are neither
- in Ann Arbor and I carry them
like a talisman on my New "Yawk"
heart.
As for transferring, that's look-
ing out of the question for next
year. But we'll see where God
wants me. For now, I think He
likes Ann Arbor.

Progress at last

have a friend who lives on the
Wayne State campus in midtown
Detroit, and his 21st birthday
party was last
Friday. I really -
wanted to go, but,
lacking a car, I had
to sit down andG
consider my pub-
lic transit options.4
This is what II
came up with:
I could take the CAROLYN
Ann Arbor Tran- LUSCH
sit Authority bus-
to Ypsilanti, stand
on the shoulder of I-94 for a couple
hours and eventually hitchhike to
Romulus. From there, I could hop on
the SMART bus to Detroit, where I'd
need to switch to the Detroit Depart-
ment of Transportation system,
which, if I time it right, should take
me to midtown.
There are places where it wouldn't
be a problem to travel fifty miles
across a metropolitan area without a
personal vehicle, places where such
a trip requires no more than a simple
subway ride. There's something miss-
ing in Metro Detroit, something that
state and local officials overlooked
during decades of highway construc-
tion and maintenance. According to
the American Public Transporta-
tion Association, Detroit is the only
large metro area in the U.S. without a
regional transit network.
Hopefully, that's about to change.
In December 2009, two bills were
introduced to the state legislature -
House Bill No. 5731 and No. 5732 -
which provide for the creation and
funding of a regional transit author-
ity. According to the Michigan leg-
islature's summary of the bills, the
transit authority would replace the
existing SMART system that serves
Detroit suburbs and the DDOT sys-
tem that serves the city of Detroit
(as well as the entity that oversees
them, the Regional Transit Coordi-
nating Council). This regional transit

authority would have the power to
take all steps necessary to implement
and manage a regionaltransit system.
The benefits of such a move are
clear. A unified transit authority
would be able to create a public trans-
portation system that conveniently
links the city and thesuburbs, instead
of the current situation in which one
system (SMART) serves the suburbs
and another (DDOT) serves the city.
For some people, it will make visits
and outings more convenient. For
others, it will make the difference
between employment and unemploy-
ment. With many businesses follow-
ing the trend of urban sprawl to the
suburbs, city residents who cannot
afford a car or are unable to drive
face a huge disadvantage in the job
market. Currently, the bills only
affect Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb
counties. However, a provision in the
bills allows for adjoining counties
to become members of the transit
authority, meaning that Washtenaw
County could easily benefit from the
regional system.
Despite the advantages, both the
Detroit government and Oakland
County executive L. Brooks Pat-
terson oppose the bills. Each party
is nervous about having adequate
representation on the author-
ity's board, and the city of Detroit
voiced concern that the creation off
a regional transit authority would
stall current plans for a light rail
system on Woodward Avenue. Now,
the fact that the city of Detroit and
Oakland County agree on some-
thing is surprising in itself. But they
agree on closely guarding their own
interests out of a fear that, if they
compromise with other stakehold-
ers, they will lose. This is why, a
decade into the twenty-first cen-
tury, Southeast Michigan still lacks
decent public transit. For decades,
every city, county, township, orga-
nization and company has looked
out for its own citizens, its own
members and its own profit, all the

while ignoring the greater good of
the region.
The nonprofit organization Trans-
portation Riders United has been
fighting against this fragmentation
and supporting public transporta-
tion in Metro Detroit since 2001. Last
week, I spoke to the executive direc-
tor, Megan Owens, and asked her
whether the two stakeholders had
valid concerns. She asserted that the
RTA would not significantly alter the
plan for light rail on Woodward, and
she expressed support for the method
of representation on the board of the
RTA. Despite the difficulty of satis-
fying every party's desires, Metro
Detroit "can't let regional squabbles
destroy progress yet again."
Detroit needs a
unified public
transit authority.
The bills have come up for a vote
in the State House of Representa-
tives, after which they will have to
pass through the State Senate and
be signed by the governor. Their pas-
sage would be the first step toward
catchingup with the restof the coun-
try on convenient, equitable mass
transit. There's certainly a lot more
work to be done. Ms. Owens iden-
tified a couple further steps in the
near future, including establishing
a dedicated public transit funding
source, such as a percentage of fuel
or motor vehicle-related sales taxes,
rather than beiny .directly funded
via the Compreh tsive Transporta-
tion Fund. Still, these bills will mean
that after decades of mistrust and
selfishness, Southeast Michigan is
finally making progress.

Such is the feeling that gripped

Shakespeare in the Arb Creative
Director Kate Mendeloff 10 years
ago when she began her first day of
rehearsal on "A Midsummer Night's
Dream." For the 10th anniversary of
Shakespeare in the Arb, an annual
production through the Residen-
tial College and Nichols Arboretum,
Mendeloff returns to the Heathdale
to enchant her audience with Shake-
speare's finest while celebrating the
Arb.
The first two-week "Midsummer
Night's Dream" production in 2001
was meant to be a free one-time event
after the Arb received an arts grant
from Ford Motor Co. Mendeloff,
also a RC drama instructor, directed
a theatrical production with a por-
tion of the grant. She chose to pro-
duce Shakespeare rather than a more
modern playwright such as Chekhov
because Shakespeare is more grandi-
ose and less subtle - ideal for an out-
door location with a large audience.
Shakespeare's work also calls for vari-
ous settings, highlighting the Arb's
variety.
The play was so popular that Men-
deloff brought it back the following
year and charged for tickets to fund
the expenses. The show took off,
popularizing the Arb to Ann Arbor
residents, who had been more aware
of the Matthaei Botanical Gardens
before the two parks merged in 2004.
From 2002 on, Mendeloff produced
a different Shakespeare play each
year, including "The Tempest" and

peeking out of surrounding trees and
moving among the playgoers.
"The audience is really transported
to this magical world in a way that
in a theater it's almost impossible to
do," said Gray, an LSA alumnus who
played Helena in the original produc-
tion and plays Titania this year. "You
feel the grass underneath your feet,
and you really feel like you could shut
your eyes and be there."
But as much as "Midsummer
Night's Dream" celebrates the Arb,
this year's production is more a cel-
ebration of the program's 10-year
run. The double-cast show will run
four weekends rather than the nor-
mal three, and the play is, to a great
extent, a re-creation of the first pro-
duction.
Gray is joined by a variety of
University alumni, now gradu-
ate students, who acted in previous
Shakespeare in the Arb productions,
including the first "Midsummer
Night's Dream." Mendeloff and Gray
use many of the earthy and Elizabe-
than costumes designed by Roberta
VanderMey 10 years ago. And Mende-
loff kept her approach of using three
actors per cast to play Puck, which
involves more students and lends the
show a spellbinding quality.
"I'm not trying to do a museum
piece," Mendeloff said. "But I think
the people who saw it 10 years ago will
come back and feel very comfortable.
I didn't see the point in tryingto inno-
See SHAKESPEARE, Page 9

COURTESY OF KENT MCCORMICK
The "Midsummer" actors perform scenes in eight different parts of the Arb.

"Twelfth Night."
This year's production of "A Mid-
summer's Night Dream," which Men-
deloff staged almost exactly like her
original, utilizes eight locations in the
Arb. The audience of up to 150 people
walks the Arb between each scene.
Although the play begins and ends in
the peony garden, Mendeloff tried to
pick venues that are unusual and mag-
ical - not hard to do at the Arb.
"'Midsummer Night's Dream' is
the perfect play for the Arb because
it's about how people are transformed
by the power of nature," Mendeloff
said. "That's how you feel when you
go to the Arb - you change."

Mendeloff and Production Man-
ager Carol Gray, who has either
acted in or produced nine of the 10
Shakespeare in the Arb productions,
emphasized that nature helps direct
the play.
"What we spend our early rehears-
als doing is going to these places in
the Arb and just exploring, playing,
running up and down hills, climb-
ing trees, finding interesting ways to
work with the material in the setting,"
Mendeloff said.
Both Mendeloff and Gray believe
it's vital to create an environment
for the play, rather than just a stage.

Indeed, Shakespeare in the Arb has

primarily casts University students,
but year-round Ann Arborites are the
core audience. This year, the produc-
tion put up tiny posters in Ann Arbor's
fabled fairy doors sprinkled across
downtown.
"It (has) exceeded my expecta-
tions," Gray said of Shakespeare in the
Arb's reputation in the community. "I
think it (has) really grown to be some-
thing that's this - Ann Arbor institu-

The University also considers it to
be an institution. The Office of the
Provost funds Mendeloff to bring back
the summer's production for orienta-

loff considers every chance to produce
in the Arb a treat.
"It's such a privilege to be able to
have access to this beautiful, beautiful
place and to make a contribution to my
community," she said. "As a director,
you're creating tableaus, images, and
I'm able to do it on this fantastic scale,
which I could never do anywhere else."

Neighbors' is hell on earth

By SHARON JACOBS
ManagingArts Editor
Perhaps "Neighbors From Hell"
functions within a state of existential
irony.
The show's basic
conceit concerns the
Hellmans, a family "Neighbors
of demons exiled to From Hell"
Earth. Together,
the Hellmans must Mondays at
deal with the cul- 10 p.m.
ture shock of being TBS
among the humans
as they try to destroy a drill that
would encroach on Hell.
So it's somewhat fitting, then, that
the experience of watching "Neigh-
bors" is hellish itself, and that view-
ers will experience culture shock in
acclimating to the show's outdated
references and the odd behavior of
its human characters. Unfortunately,
high-concept irony is probably not
what the late-night TBS guys were
thinking when they agreed to pro-
mote this unfunny piece of animated
crap. Bummer.
"Neighbors" opens with a scene

of Hellman patriarch Balthazar con-
demning some poor soul to "feel the
pain of a thousand deaths" by listen-
ing to "Oops I Did It Again." Interest-
ing choice, considering the wealth of
more timely hellish hits. "Party In
The USA," "Tik Tok," even Circus-
era Britney - any of these would cer-
tainly signify eternal damnation.
Soon, Satan summons our hero
and sends him and his family to
Earth for watching TV for enjoy-
ment. "Eww, that's where Ugg boots
come from," daughter Mandy com-
plains. Yeah, and also Crocs, moc-
casins - you know, shoe fads that
people still actually wear.
More irksome than the show's
misguided references, though, is the
behavior of the Hellmans' human
acquaintances. Next-door neighbor
Marjoe first appears cleaning up
after her dog Champers. "Hey you!"
she squeals, holding Champers's
excrement in her bare hand.
Marjoe turns out to be a classic

Games at Yost have turned into a non-stop
tirade against refs, the opposing team, its fans
and, most importantly, its goalie. It starts
before the first puck is dropped as fans tell ref-
erees to "check the net!" and after the official
has done so, to "check it again!." The opposing
player introductions are met with newspaper
reading by the student section. And only after
that does the crowd get rowdy.
The student section, dotted with celebrities
like "the penguin guy" and "the guys dressed
as Blues Brothers," extends the length of
the arena, filling up the sections next to and

behind both benches. It also spearheads the
cheering effort of the 6,000-plus fans in the
building, uniting the arena as one in order to
tell the refs they suck, the opposing goalie he's
a sieve, and the opposing parents they are ugly
- repeatedly.
"The kind of people who go to Yost are the
kind of people that want to act like fools," LSA
junior Jamie Fogel said last month. "It's, 'I'm
going to come and act like an idiot. I'm going
to dress like a penguin, I'm going to dress like
Thomas the Tank Engine,' and it's totally nor-
mal to do that."

And when the game stops, the crowd keeps
going. During intermission, the crowd tries to
get a lucky seven-year old riding the zamboni
to do poses that eventually results in taking his
or her shoe off and throwing itonthe ice. When
the shoe goes flying, it is always met with a
thunderous cheer. But that is just a warmup for
the second intermission, which is highlighted
by a rendition of the Blues Brothers song "Can't
Turn You Loose" and has turned into a group
dance for the entire student section.
With the volume, the intermission antics
and the raucous multitude of mean-spirited

chants comes the fact that these fans are some
of the most knowledgeable college hockey fans
in the country. The building will get just as
loud for a good penalty kill as a goal, and they
know a hand pass is legal in the defensive zone.
Most importantly, the fans have shown up
game after game ever since that final game of
Michigan's three-game series with Cornell.
Their dedication level has led to one of the
most significant home-ice advantages in the
country - the Wolverines have won

79 percent of their games at Yost since
1991.
"The dedication level, you can just
kind of see it," Engineering sophomore
Rob Eckert said in May. "When you're
surrounded by passionate people, it's
hard not to catch on."
So how did this happen? How did Yost
become the most intimidating place to
play in America? Part of the final answer
lies within the 3.7 million people who
have walked through the Yost doors, but
it begins almost 40 years before many of
today's fans were even born.
THE CHILDREN BEFORE THE
CHILDREN
Long before the Children of Yost had
the rink vibrating with noise, the arena
was housing footballs as the team's prac-
tice facility. The hockey - and the noise
- was a few streets down, inside the
Weinberg Coliseum (now the Sports Col-
iseum). It was there where then-coach
Vic Heyliger created a simple method to
put fans in the seats - win.
Six national championships brought
the crowds in and Heyliger's successor,
Al Renfrew, kept the winning method
going. By the time a young center from
Saskatchewan named Red Berenson
pulled the Michigan sweater. over his
head, supporters would line up all the
way down Hill St. to try to be one of the
approximately 2,000 lucky fans that
squeezed into the building on gameday.
"It was a great environment for us.
It wasn't just the students, it was the
townspeople, it was a little bit of every-
thing," Berenson said.
Inside that comparatively tiny of a

building, the University and the city of
Ann Arbor set the precedent for support-
ing Michigan hockey. It was obviously
smaller than Yost, and Berenson admits
it wasn't as organized, but the rules were
still the same: Pack the building. Make it
loud.
"I remember them playing 'The Vic-
tors' - a lot," Berenson said after this
season. "In a small building, as you can
imagine, it's even louder than it is in
(Yost)."

non-existent. The high volume of stu-
dents and townspeople stopped showing
up and the band became a collection of
students with nothing better to do.
"It was a kind of piecemeal situation,
like 'we have 18 tickets, who wants to
come?' " John Pasquale, Director of the
Michigan Hockey Pep Band, said in May.
"So we'll have six trombones and a flute,
two tubas and a bass drum and we'll kind
of get together and just kind of play just
for fun."
The same high ceilings and brick walls
that would be ideal for holding in sound
and adding to the raucous atmosphere
that would arrive years later only con-
tributed to the dire situation.
"There was nobody in the building,"
Berenson said. "It was like being in a big
cave."
But there were games when the poten-
tial of Yost could be seen. Twice a year,
Yost was rocking - for the other team.
When rival Michigan State came to town,
so did its supporters.
While the Wolverines and Spartans
battled on the Yost ice, the official col-
ors in the stands were Green and White.
Inside the building named for one of
the greatest figures in Michigan athlet-
ics, the sold out crowd donned the other
team's colors and watched its Spartans
play their inferior neighbors.
"It was embarrassing," Berenson said.
From the embarrassment, came
action. Berenson wanted the Michigan
State fans out of Yost, and so the coach-
ing staff began to reach out.
"One of the programs they imple-
mented was to try to block them out,"
associate head coach Mel Pearson said.
"So they did go up on campus in the Diag
and to the faculty and the students to try
to get them at least to buy Michigan State
tickets, so we wouldn't have a road game
at home."
It wasn't just going to the Diag. It was
going to the dorms. It was sending play-
ers to fraternities and sororities. It was

putting brochures in the dorm mailbox
of every freshman.
More importantly, it was turn-
ing a 12-26-0 record into 22-15-4 and
eventually, turning that into 34-10-3.
Wearers of the Maize and Blue began
to fill the building consistently. By the
time Michigan hosted the 1991 NCAA
regional, it had enough fans to set a
weekend attendance record that still
stands to this day.
But the attendance was onlythe first
step in creating a true home-ice advan-
tage.
THE TURNING POINT
The student section, barely extend-
ing blue line to blue line behind the
benches, had already started the
countdown.
No. 3 seed Michigan was up 4-3
on sixth-seeded Cornell as the sec-
onds slowly counted down in the 1991
Regional.
The crowd, staring at the approxi-
mately 200 Cornell fans situated near
center ice on the side opposite of the
student section, belted out the num-
bers. "Five! Four! Three! Two!...". But
the countdown never finished.
Big Red forward Kent Manderville
slapped a backhand shot from the top
of the circle past freshman goaltender
Steve Shields to tie the game. Cor-
nell then scored on its first trip down
the ice in overtime to end the game,
but it was the halted countdown that
spurred the veteran BigRed crowd.
"I've never heard a countdown
stop," William Sangrey, a Cornelligrad-
uate student at the time said. "Five,
four, three, two, and it stopped. The
whole building just stopped."
The following night, as the first
period waned down, the boisterous
Cornellians added a new chant to their
already versatile repertoire.
"They would go, 'Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four, three, two,
OHHH!' to make fun of the crowd
reaction," then-Michigan graduate
student Matt Thullen said.
But the Michigan fans were drawn
in before that.
The personal cheers and clever-
ness of Cornell clicked with them, and
on that weekend in mid-March, the
crowd took its first step toward becom-
ing what it is today. In the face of the
rowdy Ivy League crowd, it began to
defend its building.
"(The Cornell fans) were loud and
they got their message across, and I
think the fans kind of took it as a chal-
lenge," Thullen said. "We're the ones
with the intimidating building. We're
the home team.
"We're not going to let these guys
come in and basically do anything
(they want)."

But many of the Michigan fans were
new to college hockey and didn't know
how to pass the test presented by the
Cornell contingent. So, the Wolverine
fans took the Big Red's cheers.
The number and variety of cheers
that were taken vary, depending on the
memory of each person that was there.
Some say that Steve Shields wasn't the
only goalie who had his mother call to
tell him he sucked.
Others can only remember Cornell
goaltender Jim Crozier getting hit
with "It's all your fault! It's all your
fault!" added to the end of Michigan's
already established goal count. But the
most important lesson that Big Red
crowd taught wasn't a specific chant -
it was the attitude that a college hockey
crowd should have.
"I think that the Cornell folks kind
of taught us how you can really make
a chant that really gets under people's
skin a little bit better," Thullen said.
And after a 6-4 Michigan win, the
decisive game came on a St. Patrick's
Day Sunday in front of Berenson's first
sellout that wasn't against Michigan
State. Michigan rode the crowd to a
9-3 victory.
The winning method had been
restored.
The win also ended the three-day
fan crash course. The Michigan faith-
ful left for seven months of hiberna-
tion, unsure if the atmosphere would
take hold without Cornell baiting
them.
So in the home opener of the 1991-
92 season, the crowd faced another test
- Michigan State. The fans showed up,
and armed with their knowledge from
early March, Michigan home games
have never been the same.
"The very first series of games, it
was packed," Eric Storhok, a graduate
student at the time, said last month.
"There was enough students that once
somebody came up with a clever cheer,
everybody was doing it immediately."
It was the beginning of the mod-
ern era of the Yost crowd, one that
has relied on the cheers and ability to
adapt that was taught to them by 200
kids from Ithaca, New York.
And when the Big Red came back to
Yost in 1997, they saw the monster they
had created.
"They gave us a hard time about
stealing their chants and those of us
who were at that game were like, 'if we
could chant 'thank you,' we would,"
Storhok said...
