Live Zero Waste is an 

online platform that provides 
resources and tools for those 
interested in living a waste-
free lifestyle, started by LSA 
senior Samuel McMullen and 
his older sister, University 
of 
Michigan 
alum 
Lydia 

McMullen, in 2016. The Live 
Zero Waste team has recently 
grown and is now composed of 
six students who are working 
to increase the initiative’s 
presence online, on campus 
and in the greater Ann Arbor 
community.

Samuel 
first 
pledged 
to 

live “zero waste”, a lifestyle 
that entails generating no 
disposable waste and reusing 
resources, during the summer 
of 
2015. 
His 
sister 
was 

writing a paper on renewable 
energy policy in Beijing as a 
side project for the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, 
and she brought him along as 
a research assistant. Together, 
they gave a presentation on 
how living zero waste benefits 
the environment.

In 
researching 
for 
the 

presentation, Samuel started 
to learn how the vast majority 
of waste is caused by the 
production chain that yields a 
purchased good.

“We started looking at the 

numbers and how much trash 
you can save not downstream 
but upstream of where you 

are,” he said. “By not buying 
this 
thing 
you 
prevented 

all the trash that went into 
making it.”

As part of the presentation, 

both Lydia and Sam pledged to 
live zero waste for a year.

“Part of her presentation 

training was to make a promise 
and a request,” Samuel said. 
“We 
decided 
our 
promise 

would be that we would do 
zero waste for a year, and our 

request was that other people 
join for like some amount of 
time if they wanted to. At the 
NRDC we got our first round 
of pledges.”

After pledging to live zero 

waste themselves and learning 
more about the lifestyle, the 
McMullen 
siblings 
became 

invested in educating other 
people and enabling them to 
lead more sustainable lives.

“After 
we 
did 
that 

presentation we thought, ‘This 
is a pretty good idea, let’s work 
with it and make it a process 
where people can pledge and 
we’ll help them out,’” he said. 
“A lot of the struggle with 
zero waste is finding other 
resources and figuring out 
what it actually means.”

Throughout the following 

year, the two worked on 
developing 
the 
Live 
Zero 

The University of Michigan 

was ranked No. 1 in research 
and 
development 
spending 

among 
all 
U.S. 
public 

universities by the National 
Science Foundation, marking 
the 
University’s 
seventh 

consecutive year holding this 
title. Following the University 
is University of California, San 
Francisco, and University of 
Washington, Seattle.

In the 2016 fiscal year, the 

University spent $1,436,448 
dollars 
in 
research 
and 

development, surpassing UCSF 
by more than $100,000.

works with research in the

and expressed her appreciation 
of the research opportunities 
available 
for 
students 
on

“Research 
is 
important 

because it allows for both 
individuals and communities 
to take that extra step forward 
in providing an understanding 
of a bigger picture in the grand 
scheme of things. It also opens

representatives 
are 
now 

calling for their colleague, U.S.

resign following allegations of 
sexual harassment.

U.S. 
Rep. 
Dan 
Kildee, 

D-Mich., 
was 
the 
first 

Democratic congressman from 
Michigan to urge Conyers step 
down from the seat he first 
won in 1964, telling CNN the 
people cannot tolerate an act 
that is an abuse of power. 

“I 
think 
Congressman 

Conyers should resign,” Kildee 
said on CNN. “No person … 
should have to tolerate what 
has been alleged.”

Kildee is now joined by U.S. 

Reps. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., 
and Sander Levin, D-Mich., in 
that request, according to the 
Detroit Free Press.

Many other members of

CARLY RYAN

Daily Staff Reporter

During a panel of local 

elected 
officials 
in 
the 

weeklong 
#StopSpencer 

campaign, 
officeholders 

discussed how to combat hate 
speech and white nationalism 
without providing a platform 
for a negative ideology, a 
conversation that was held as 
park of a teach-in. The teach-
in was just one event of their 
“Week of Action” protesting 
the University of Michigan’s 
consideration to allow white 
supremacist Richard Spencer 
to speak on campus if a safe 
venue and time is found.

Many students expressed 

their frustration regarding 
how to proceed in the face of 
deciding between protesting if 
Richard Spencer were to visit 
and therefore providing him 
with a platform or allowing 
Spencer to spread his ideas 
without resistance.

“This is the tip of the 

iceberg,” 
said 
state 
Rep. 

Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor in 
response. “Richard Spencer is 
the tip of the iceberg. Richard 
Spencer is just a mouthpiece.”

Rabhi cited the fact that 

Ann Arbor is the fourth 
highest metropolitan city in 
terms of racial segregation.

“This 
is 
real 
and 
it’s 

happening here,” Rabhi said. 
“I hope we stop Spencer, but I 
hope it doesn’t stop there.”

Many 
elected 
officials 

such as Washtenaw County 
Commissioners Felicia Brabec 
and Jason Morgan, and Rabhi, 
argued for students to stand 
strong and not provide a 
platform for Spencer’s hate 
speech. The officials argued 
students need to find a way 
to be heard without giving 
a voice to white supremacy, 
whether by forcing Spencer 
to speak to an empty room of 
people, or offering alternative 
rallies 
preaching 
positive 

ideologies.

Week of action against white supremacist 
Richard Spencer closes with strike on class

On Thursday, students across 

campus participated in a strike 
as part of the #StopSpencer 
week of action. The event, hosted 
in part by Students4Justice — a 
student 
organization 
whose 

mission is to hold the University 
of 
Michigan 
administration 

accountable for inequities on 
campus — consisted of class 
cancelations, accommodations 
and a student sit-in.

On Nov. 23, Students4Justice 

and other organizers called 
for faculty, graduate student 
instructors, research assistants 
and staff to cancel classes 
Thursday 
to 
pressure 
the 

administration to deny Richard 
Spencer’s request to speak on 
campus, following its decision 
to consider allowing him to 
speak if a safe time and venue is 
found.

“The 
recent 
decision 
to 

‘begin discussions with Richard 
Spencer’s group to determine 
whether he will be allowed to 
rent space’ on the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
campus 

demonstrates, 
as 
we 
have 

learned time and time again, the 
administration’s refusal to truly 
prioritize the needs and safety 

of its students,” the statement 
read. “Though President Mark 
Schlissel stated ‘if we cannot 
assure a reasonably safe setting 
for the event, we will not allow 
it to go forward,’ Spencer’s 
history shows us there is no 
‘safe’ setting possible when 
white supremacists and neo-
Nazis are given permission to 
come to college campuses.”

The 
groups 
explained 

that 
marginalized 
students 

on campus are in danger of 
hate crimes on campus every 
day; they fall victim to racist 
flyering, graffiti and slurs. They 
explained students come to the 
University to learn and when 
individuals like Spencer are 
allowed to convene on campus, 
there is a “barrier” to their 
existence and education.

“We ask that you stand in 

solidarity with us, marginalized 
folx 
across 
campus 
and 

the broader community, by 
canceling 
class, 
discussions, 

labs and any other academic 
obligations on Thursday, Nov. 
30, 2017,” the statement read.

On 
Tuesday, 
LSA 
Dean 

Andrew Martin and Elizabeth 
Birr Moje, dean of the School of 
Education, announced classes 
would not be canceled Thursday 
in response to the ongoing 
activities opposing Spencer.

their respective emails that 
though 
they 
support 
the 

right of students to protest, 
they encouraged them to not 
participate.

“We 
urge 
you 
not 
to 

participate in such a protest, 
which gives power to the 
people who spread falsehoods 
and 
hate,” 
Moje 
wrote. 

“Instead, we urge you to teach 
your courses and use them 
as an opportunity to engage 
our students in discussions 
about free speech, the power 
of multiple perspectives, how 
to launch productive protests, 
and about the right to the 
opportunity to learn for all 
people.”

Instructors take action
With a number of students 

planning 
to 
participate 
in 

the strike, professors across 
campus 
acknowledged 

the 
ongoing 
#StopSpencer 

events 
and 
made 
efforts 

to 
accommodate 
students 

missing class. 

David Gerdes, Arthur F. 

Thurnau Professor of Physics, 
did not cancel class Thursday, 
but offered accommodations 
for students in his Physics 240 
class, 
making 
participation 

extra credit and providing 
students the opportunity to 
make up attendance points. 

Though 
Gerdes 
said 
he 

understands students should 
protest Spencer in their own 
way, he believes holding class 
Thursday 
and 
encouraging 

attendance 
is 
the 
most 

powerful course of action.

“I understand the urge to 

protest Spencer, however I 
think that someone like him 
derives his power from the 
power to distract, disrupt and 
capture the narrative,” Gerdes 
said. “I don’t feel that the best 
way to respond to ignorance 
and hatred is to bring our 
teaching mission grinding to 
a halt. But I understand that 
people disagree about this.”

Ultimately, Gerdes said he 

believes opening a conversation 

with students about recent 
events is a significant step 
professors should take.

“I thought it would be 

important 
to 
not 
pretend 

that we live in a bubble, to 
acknowledge 
what’s 
going 

on and to make the students 
understand that I am aware of 
their concerns and that I share 
many of their concerns and I 
am willing to support them 
within reason,” he said.

Associate 
Sociology 

professor 
Sandra 
Levitsky 

rescheduled 
her 
Thursday 

class in light of the day’s 
events.

“My planned lecture for 

today 
was 
really 
essential 

for the final class paper and 
I didn’t want anyone to be 
disadvantaged for missing it,” 
Levitsky said.

Fortunately, Levitsky had an 

extra class built in the syllabus, 
meaning students will not be 
academically affected.

Several GSIs also canceled 

discussion 
sections. 
One 

GSI, who asked to remain 
anonymous to not jeopardize 

her job, told her students 
that while canceling a 
class defies both LSA and 
departmental policy, she 
would do so.

“I strongly believe that 

learning happens in and 
out of the classroom,” 
she wrote in an email 
to her students. “Please 
take this time to educate 
yourself 
about 
current 

issues, reflect on your 
responsibilities to ensure 
a safe and welcoming 
space to learn, and act 
according to your beliefs.”

Students sit in at Dean’s 

office

Late 
Thursday 

morning, a couple dozen 
students held a sit-in at 
Martin’s office, talking 
to Martin and Angela 
Dillard, 
LSA 
associate 

dean 
of 
undergraduate 

education. 
Throughout 

the 
sit-in, 
students 

continually 
took 
issue 

with the administrators’ 
tones,

STRIKE
From Page 1

Every Friday, The Michigan 
Daily republishes an article 
from The Daily’s archives 
from a moment in University 
history. 

January 10, 1970 
— “This 

is one struggle the people 
will win,” vows a bearded 
Blue Panther revolutionary, 
speaking of the battle over 
the name of the sign in the 
Regent’s Plaza. This battle, 
begun last term, seems to be 
growing more heated as the 
winter becomes colder.

One minute the sign says 

“Regent’s Plaza,” and the 
next it is repainted to say 
“People’s Plaza.” You never 
can be quite sure what the 
name of the plaza between 
the SAB and the Union is 
at any one moment without 
first consulting the sign.

The struggle to control 

the sign is escalating into 

a half-serious game of 
wits fought by a group of 
students calling themselves 
the “Canadian Blue 
Panthers” and another 
group calling itself “the 
University.”

According to a scoreboard 

posted in the SAB office of 
the SGC coordinating Vice 
President Bruce Wilson, 
the score in the battle is 
now People 713 and Regents 
a puny 100. This score is 
compiled by totaling up the 
hours in which the sign says 
either “People’s Plaza” or 
“Regent’s Plaza,” counting 
from Dec. 6, the day of the 
first repainting by the Blue 
Panthers.

A spokesman for the 

Panthers, who called 
himself the chairman of 
the sign division, hinted 
that repainting of the sign, 
which as of yesterday 

said “Regent’s Plaza,” is 
imminent and could take 
place “some night around 
about midnight.” He fondled 
a can of blue spray paint as 
he spoke.

“We would have repainted 

the sign sooner, but it 
was too cold,” he went 
on defensively, as if his 
revolutionary zeal might 
be questioned. “Anyway, 
the plant workers have 
something which takes 
enamel off the sign.”

As if to emphasize that 

the struggle for control of 
the sign is a true people’s 
struggle, the Panther 
spokesman pointed out 
that “the masses have 
occasionally done the job 
for us.”

Plant manager A.B. 

Veker, less concerned with 
the ideological questions 

involved in the struggles 
and more concerned with 
the problem of the sign 
itself, admits that “we 
haven’t any idea how to stop 
the repainting of the sign.”

“We haven’t found the guy 

who’s doing it yet,” Veker 
says.

Plant workers did try one 

tricky maneuver over the 
Christmas holidays, taking 
the plates off the sign. They 
put the plates, which said 
“Regent’s Plaza,” back on 
the sign last Wednesday.

According to the Blue 

Panther spokesman, the 
struggle for the sign is being 
aided by the fact that “the 
guys in the Plant Dept. don’t 
like working on weekends.”

Hammoud, D-Dearborn, said 
students should use this issue 
as an opportunity to bring 
strong civil rights leaders to 
the University to overpower 
Spencer’s ideas with powerful 
representatives 
of 
racial 

equality.

Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman, D-Ward 3, echoed 
this sentiment, stating the 
community should be focused 
on positive action rather than 
constant criticism.

“We need to focus on 

the benefits we can bring,” 
Ackerman said. “We need to 
stop being hyperfocused on 
the ‘alt-right’ failures and 
instead what we can do to 
make it better because the 
‘alt-right’ is more focused 
on us than Trump or his 
failures.”

Throughout the panel, the 

elected officials highlighted 
the importance of the voice of 
the student body.

“I believe that we can keep 

our idealism and passion. 
Hopefully we can bring them 
along or push them along,” 
Morgan 
said, 
regarding 

the importance of young 
perspectives 
in politics.

In a room 

where 
every 
seat was 
filled 
and 
several 
students 

were 
forced 
to 

stand, Brabec said 
she was encouraged 
to see how many 
students had come 
out 
in 
response 

to 
the 
situation 

despite the stress of 
finals.

LSA 
freshman 

Amy Ransom said 
she has participated in the 
week of action because she 
believes it is more important 
than everyday work.

“It’s important that no 

matter what is going on in 
our lives — finals or papers — 
we all participate and stand 
against this issue,” Ransom 
said.

Morgan said Spencer is 

representative 
of 
a 
much 

larger issue. In the past year, 
racist posters and graffiti 
have been found in multiple 
instances on campus.

“We are not as progressive 

as we should be,” Morgan 
said. “We should be the most 

progressive.”

Students and officials alike 

agreed 
the 
#StopSpencer 

campaign was nowhere near 
over and they would continue 
to discuss ways to combat his 
impending visit.

Earlier 
in 
the 
evening, 

the second teach-in of the 
Week of Action for Protest 
Safety Training was held 
in an East Quad Residence 
Hall classroom. The event 
was hosted in part by the 
Non-Compliance 
Collective, 

an Ann Arbor-based group 
which, 
according 
to 
its 

Facebook page, aims to “reject 
all compliance with the rules, 
regulations, and norms that 
any person or system intends 
to impose on our bodies, 
minds, or beings.”

The teach-in emphasized 

ways 
to 
stay 
safe 
and 

be 
prepared 
at 
protests. 

Attendees were advised to 
take 
several 
measures 
to 

protect themselves. Among 
other steps, they were advised 
to use a fake name while 
protesting and to not take 
photos or record any aspect of 
the protest.

Before the event began, 

attendees were asked basic 

questions, such as if 
they were students or 

police 

to 

ensure 
the 
safety 

of everyone in 
attendance. 
The 

speakers stressed that if 

a protester is going to talk to 
someone about their protest 
participation, it should be 
someone they trust.

Speakers 
told 
audience 

members to consider how 
far they would be willing to 
go to protest. For example, 
attendees 
were 
asked 
to 

consider if they would be 
willing 
to 
get 
arrested. 

Though the speakers noted 
it would be inconvenient to 
get arrested, they explained 
sometimes arrests and the 
attention they draw may serve 
to help the cause.

Additionally, 
speakers 

advised 
attendees 
to 
not 

bring their cell phones to the 
protests, but if they must, to 
disable the fingerprint and 
face 
recognition 
features, 

establish a strong passcode 

and encrypt data so the police 
do not have access to personal 
information in the event of an 
arrest.

Speakers also emphasized 

creating an affinity group — 
a small group of trustworthy 
people, with whom protests 
can be planned. 

Finally, 
the 
speakers 

discussed what the police 
strategies 
were 
like 
at 

University 
of 

Florida, which 

ultimately 
allowed 
Spencer 
on 
campus 

after 
facing 

a 
lawsuit, 

and how to be safe around the 
police. They also went over 
the basic booking process so 
the attendees will be prepared 
in case of being arrested and 
basic 
medical 
procedures, 

such as giving someone with 
symptoms of hypothermia a 
jacket, and help for protecting 
their identity and avoiding 
a 
higher 
police 
presence. 

To conclude, the speakers 
stressed the importance of 
these procedures is so the 
protestors are able to take 
care of each other and get 
their message across in the 
most impactful way possible.

In cooperation with the 

teach-in’s advice to engage 
in self-protection measures, 
after 
the 
event, 
student 

attendees asked to remain 
anonymous.

“I think it’s important to 

give people, protesters, the 
idea that this a big deal,” a 
student said. “It is important 
to have knowledge of this 
matter, particularly because 
the other side has knowledge 
on 
that 
matter 
and 
so 

everything about this is all 
about information and so 

the more information 

you have the more 
successful 
you’ll 

be.” 

Another student 

emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 

ensuring 
safety 

and strategy while 

protesting, 

reiterating 

the 
key 

concepts 
put forth 
in 
the 

event.

“This 

is important 
because 
it’s 

a 
reality 

that 
might 

happen, 
the 

protest, 
and 
if 
you 

choose 
to 

participate 
in it or not 
you want to 
know 
how 

to stay safe 
and 
keep 

others 
safe 

so it’s just a logical way 
to protest — not just on 
a whim, but have a plan 
going into it,” the student 
said.

Professor K. Rivet Amico, Health Behavior and Higher Education research 
associate, speaks at the World AIDS Day Panel in the School of Public Health 
Thursday.

AIDS AWARE NESS

currently 
serving 
member 

of Congress, is considered a 
prominent civil rights activist, 
and some worry these allegations 
will discredit the advancements 
he has made for the Civil Rights 
movement. However, Pelosi stood 
by a zero tolerance perspective 
regardless of the consequences.

“The 
allegations 
against 

Congressman 
Conyers, 
as 

we’ve heard more and more 
since 
Sunday, 
are 
serious, 

disappointing and very credible,” 
she said. “It’s very sad. A brave 
woman came forward. … Zero 
tolerance means consequences 
for everyone — no matter how 
great a legacy is no license to 
harass or discriminate.”

However, Conyers’ attorney, 

Arnold Reed, argued members 

of Congress should hold no stake 
in whether or not Conyers leaves 
office, but rather it should be the 
choice of his constituents.

“It is not up to Nancy Pelosi, 

Nancy Pelosi did not elect Mr. 
Conyers,” Reed said in a press 
conference, according to NBC. 
“And she sure as hell won’t be 
the one to tell the congressman 
to leave.”

Fellow longtime member of 

the Congressional Black Caucus, 
U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., 
and U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, 
R-Mich., also agreed Conyers 
should step down. Still, the rest 
of 
Michigan’s 
congressional 

delegation has yet to make a 
statement on Conyers since last 
week’s allegations.

Conyers has already stepped 

down from his seat as the 
ranking member of the House 
Judiciary Committee, and was 
hospitalized Thursday morning 
due to to stress.

unnecessarily defensive.

LSA senior Hoai An Pham, 

the press coordinator for the 
Stop Spencer at the University 
of Michigan coalition, said 
Martin’s disinclination to send 
the message that Spencer’s 
trolling matters was akin to 
calls to ignore Spencer and his 
followers. She said this would 
only allow Spencer’s ideas to 
flourish.

“I think what a lot of people 

have been saying is, ‘Why 
don’t you just ignore him? 
Why don’t you just ignore this 
and let him do his thing?’ Are 
we supposed to just ignore 
actual Nazis when anything 
has happened? Do we just say, 
‘Oh, it’ll solve itself?’ ” Pham 
said. “Let’s look at everything 
else that has happened in 
history. We can look at what 

happened with Hitler, we 
can look at slavery — a lot of 
people sat there and said we’re 
going to let this happen, but 
if everybody had done that, if 
everyone had said, ‘Let’s just 
let them do their thing,’ it 
never would have ended.”

Students also noted Martin 

wasn’t answering questions 
directed 
at 
him, 
instead 

letting Dillard answer for him.

“We’ve asked you questions 

explicitly, and she answers,” 
one student said. “Not saying 
that she has to or you’re making 
her, but I’m just saying that 
you’re not saying anything. 
And it’s frustrating.”

Following a long silence, 

Martin 
answered, 
“What 

questions can I address?” to 
audible expressions of further 
frustration from students.

After Martin said there 

wasn’t anything happening 
on campus Thursday that 
put students in any physical 

danger, 
students 
said 
the 

administration 
didn’t 

correctly 
understand 
their 

concerns or what they were 
protesting.

“So you think people are 

lying? 
You 
think 
people 

are 
lying 
that 
they 
feel 

unsafe? That’s what is really 
frustrating — that people here 
are literally telling you they 
feel unsafe and you’re saying 
that you don’t think it’s true,” 
a student replied.

Pham said the issue was 

also bigger than just Spencer’s 
request.

“I think that what the 

administration 
don’t 

understand is that this entire 
week was not only to stop 
Spencer, but to stop white 
supremacy and to stop the 
white supremacy that already 
exists on this campus,” she 
said. “We do not feel safe 
in classrooms where people 
wake up in the morning and 
there’s the n-word written 
on their door decorations. 
They need to understand that 
it’s not us just doing this for 
fun. We don’t have a choice 
as students when we have to 
protest our own fundamental 
human rights.”

After one student started 

speaking through a bullhorn, 
Martin and Dillard left the 
room. It was symbolic, a 
student said, that they could 
step out while the students 
were still there protesting.

Waste platform, which aimed 
to 
provide 
resources 
and 

information for other people to 
join the zero waste movement. 
In the spring of 2016, Samuel 
was chosen to give a TED Talk at 
the TEDxUofM event about his 
journey and living zero waste. The 
talk helped to publicize Live Zero 
Waste on campus and catalyze the 
development of the website.

The 
McMullen 
siblings 

continued to run and grow the 
platform by themselves until fall 
2017, when Samuel enrolled in an 
entrepreneurship course in which 
students form groups and create 
something based on an idea. It 
was here that McMullen met 
Business senior Debbie Cheng, 
along 
with 
four 

other students, to 
help cultivate Live 
Zero Waste.

“I looked on his 

website, I saw the 
TED Talk, and I 
was really amazed 
by it,” Cheng said. 
“I wanted to be 
part of it because 
(Sam) was super 
proactive 
and 

passionate 
about 

it 
and 
I 
really 

saw 
that 
we 

could really make 
something big on 
campus and around the globe.”

Cheng works on the business 

development side of Live Zero 
Waste, reaching out to local 
businesses such as Lucky’s Market 
and Roo’s Roast to advertise 
the brand. Two other students 
work on developing the website 
and a mobile application, while 
another student, who is from 
France, brings an international 
perspective, as European culture 
and institutions are more zero-
waste friendly.

Engineering 
junior 
Brett 

Swiecicki is one of the members 
working 
to 
create 
a 
mobile 

application 
which 
will 
allow 

people to share their experience 
going 
waste-free 
and 
access 

helpful resources. by allowing 
users to post to the app when they 
make a change. The application 
would help involve millennials in 
the movement, Live Zero Waste’s 

target audience.

“The main motive to develop 

the app was so that it would be 
easier for users to maintain track 
of their progress and have easier 
access to educational content on 
a variety of different platforms,” 
Swiecicki said.

The application would ideally 

involve a social media aspect in 
which people could post when 
they’ve made progress toward 
living waste-free for their friends 
to see.

“It really relies on having a 

network effect to be successful,” 
Cheng said. “Once you have your 
friends doing it makes it a lot 
easier to try it.”

The McMullens and Cheng 

hope Live Zero Waste can help 
increase awareness and action 
among students and community 
members who may already be 

environmentally 
conscious, 
but 

don’t 
know 
how 

to 
change 
their 

lifestyles to reflect 
their beliefs.

“Mostly 
it’s 

getting 
the 

awareness 
that 

your 
purchasing 

decision 
causes 

a 
huge 
network 

effect 
that 
most 

people don’t think 
about,” 
Samuel 

said. “I didn’t think 
about it.”

Going 
forward, 

the team hopes to use the 
University community as a launch 
pad for Live Zero Waste.

“The local community here is 

our first step,” Cheng said. “Once 
we’ve got the website and the 
mobile application off the ground, 
which we’ve made a lot of good 
strides, but we want to improve it 
more, we can reach a bigger area.”

Even if only for a short period 

of time, Live Zero Waste hopes 
to encourage people to try out 
a waste-free lifestyle so they 
have heightened awareness of 
consumption habits and make 
more sustainable choices in the 
future.

“It’s really just about getting 

over the hump rather than trying 
to just focus on a few people doing 
it for like years and years and 
years,” Cheng said. “It’s let’s try 
to get them to do it for a day, then 
a week, a month, a year.”

T

his 
Thanksgiving, 
I 

was upgraded from my 
perennial seat teetering 

awkwardly in between 
the kids’ table and 
adults’ table; I was 
given 
permission 

to officially enter a 
more 
sophisticated 

environment. Eat your 
hearts out, younger 
siblings and cousins. 

It was not long 

before I realized that 
the prospect of a table 
with candles and a 
centerpiece had made me too 
optimistic. The topic discussed in 
the big leagues this evening: college 
campuses and free speech — hardly 
the 
lighthearted 
conversation 

I wanted to have after gorging 
myself with food.

As far as I imagine political 

conversations 
at 
Thanksgiving 

dinner tables across the country 
typically go, however, the one at 
mine happened to be quite tame. 
There was little shouting, frequent 
laughter and not once did I think 
that anyone was having second 
thoughts about foregoing politically-
affiliated assigned seating.

But there was one thing in the 

debate over the campus free speech 
conundrum I found unsettling. 
It was something equally as 
unsettling at the Thanksgiving 
table as it had been when it arose at 
the University of Michigan Board 
of Regents’ table two days prior 
and then at The New York Times’ 
news desk the next week. Free 
speech on college campuses was 
exposing the larger normalization 
of neo-Nazism in today’s politics, 
and liberals had become unwitting 
contributors to this.

Like the rest of the country, I 

had expected at least some degree 
of normalcy when a champion of 
white nationalists ascended to the 
Oval Office. Still, the throning of a 
Mexican-denigrating, 
both-sides 

shaming and Pocahontas name-
calling 
demagogue 
exceeded 

expectations. The once-dormant 
Stephen Millers and Steve Bannons 
of the world were allowed to enter 
mainstream politics, bringing the 
“fringe” beliefs shared by their 
loyal acolytes with them.

Neo-Nazis 
have 
enough 

powerful allies as it stands today. 

The left — or anyone, frankly, who 
believes in fairness and equality 
irrespective of race, religion or 

creed — should not feel 
compelled to be one of 
them or sympathize 
with them. Articles like 
the softening profile 
of Tony Hovater, an 
Ohio-based neo-Nazi 
whose 
“Midwestern 

manners would please 
anyone’s 
mother,” 

that The New York 
Times published last 
Saturday do just that.

Though 
these 
self-serving 

pieces 
most 
assuredly 
cause 

liberals to rejoice in their supposed 
show of tolerance, a shortcoming 
that conservatives have loved to 
attack, any victory is shallow and 
short-lived. Sympathizing with 
Nazi sympathizers is antithetical 
to ostracizing their brand of 
baseless bigotry. Liberals need 
not pat themselves on the back 
for legitimizing an outsider voice; 
when 
that 
outsider 
espouses 

white supremacy or Nazism, then 
anything short of rebuke merely 
continues to lazily promote the 
narrative in which unadulterated 
hatred is falsely equated with 
“political belief.”

Though this may be the reality 

of our current political landscape, 
the 
kicking-the-can-down-the-

road attitude that humanizes, 
rather than ostracizes, America’s 
neo-Nazis, must be curbed at once.

Outlets like The New York 

Times hardly owe anyone a 
platform on their powerful pages, 
much less white supremacists and 
Nazis whose beliefs have as great 
a factual foundation as fake news. 
While the media may indulge itself 
in propagating hate under the 
guise of tolerance, the University of 
Michigan should not.

That’s why the Board of Regents’ 

and University President Mark 
Schlissel’s decision on Tuesday that 
moved Richard Spencer one step 
closer to speaking on campus was 
so disheartening.

In not allowing Richard Spencer 

to speak on campus, we would 
not, as University Regent Mark 
Bernstein (D) eulogized, be failing 
in our mission to promote free 
expression. Nor would we “provide 
even more attention to the speaker,” 

as 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel wrote in a campus-wide 
email, if the University were to 
reject Spencer, as schools including 
Michigan State University, Ohio 
State University, Pennsylvania State 
University, the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill and Auburn 
University 
have 
done. 
These 

institutions have courageously 
challenged the new normal.

What we are doing is embracing 

it. We are overcorrecting for our 
past transgressions in which our 
student body wrongly denied far 
less odious figures the right to free 
speech by choosing the nuclear 
option. Richard Spencer gets a 
platform at the University. Tony 
Hovater has a spread in The Times. 
I discuss the merits of Nazi speech 
at the Thanksgiving table.

It is true that many students on 

campus need to realize that not all 
conservative speakers on campus 
are the devil incarnate. Heeding 
Elie Wiesel’s famous words that, 
“The opposite of love is not hate, 
it’s indifference,” would be an 
effective approach to combating 
this provocative strain of evil, 
because we cannot be complacent. 
But I am hesitant to use Spencer as 
the example for this re-education. 
When hate is as uniquely sinister 
and as far-reaching as Spencer’s 
is, we ought to be happy, not 
dismayed, that there is pushback 
from students and faculty on 
campus. For the administration, it 
is hard to say the same.

At what point do we draw 

the line? When men with even 
more hateful views and actual 
political power than Spencer 
inevitably request to speak at the 
University, will the University let 
them speak too?

Or will we continue to treat 

our adherence to the Constitution 
as a suicide pact until regrettable 
repeats of history emerge?

I certainly hope not, but I am 

not holding my breath. There’s 
a reason why Dictionary.com 
chose “complicit” as its word of 
the year for 2017. When Spencer 
and 
his 
gang 
of 
swastika-

wielding, 
violent 
criminals 

roll into town, that reason will 
quickly become apparent.

L

et him come. Bring it on. 
I want Richard Spencer. 

I’m not the other that 

he fixates on. Sure, I’m one of 
the snowflakes who voted for 
Hillary Clinton, and I’m Middle 
Eastern. But I’m not Muslim. 
I’m not Jewish, either, nor am I 
Black. All of this is to say I am 
not the one who deserves the 
final say in this matter. I am 
not explicitly threatened by his 
toxicity the way my friends and 
classmates are.

Still, I want him. I want 

his ignoble crusade to make a 
stop on our campus. Yes, his 
ideology is capable of inflicting 
great suffering, some of which 
we’ve already seen. But I’ve 
watched him take a punch; 
I’ve seen his followers try to 
peacock as something more 
menacing than the scared and 
threatened lot they are.

I’m not afraid of him.
I’m more afraid of not 

knowing 
his 
supporters, 

especially the ones so close 
to us. Come out. Own your 
violence and your hatred. I 
want to know who you are, even 
though you see a subhuman 
any time you don’t see a white 
human.

I 
don’t 
think 
Richard 

Spencer wants to speak here. 
It serves his purposes more to 
be blocked from speaking, so 
that he can cast himself as the 
victim of an unruly and restless 
liberal youth that needs to be 
disciplined and educated in 
the realm of what’s “mature.” 
What he doesn’t realize is 
that we are far more mature 
than 
what 
his 
corrupted, 

compromised, feeble brain is 
capable of.

At its best, this campus is 

not a safe haven for his ilk. 
At its worst, it has enough 
dynamics to elicit conflict from 
a controversy like this. There is 
racism on this campus because 
there are racists on this campus. 
As there have been. This is not 
news. Unfortunately we don’t 
know how many, but we know 
that they are currently the 
silent, scared minority. 

Richard Spencer is more 

afraid of us than we are of him. 
At the end of the day, his fears 
of a more just, diverse and 
equitable world are coming true. 
Yes, this is delayed all the time, 

and in the news we see that it is 
possible not just to delay it but 
also to reverse it. But only in 
moments, not in totality.

It’s easy for me to feel like the 

world’s never been worse. I’ve 
only been alive for a moment, 
and in this moment there 
seems to be sexual violence 
everywhere, 
racial 
injustice 

everywhere, 
human 
rights 

abuses everywhere. It seems 
that way because it is so — this 
evil is here, in great force.

What 
I 
do 
well 
to 

remember is that this evil 

has been around since the 
beginning, in quantities far 
more overwhelming. Ask any 
marginalized 
person; 
they 

can point to a time when their 
people were more persecuted, 
more 
degraded, 
more 

threatened, more isolated than 
they are now. The difference 
is our awareness of such evil. 
While excruciatingly painful, 
we better address our worst 
demons when we can see them.

And so, we are at a junction. 

This is part of the fight for the 
direction of our country. We 
can shrink away from it and 
feel safer. We can drown out 
the voices we hate, block that 
Twitter account that causes 
us duress and turn off the 
channels that propagate lies 
and deception to our neighbors.

Or, we can listen. We can 

allow Richard Spencer to speak 
to those that are interested. 
Where they supply violence, 
we’ll 
provide 
self-defense. 

Wouldn’t it be nice to know 
your classmate thinks you’re 
inferior? Isn’t it better to know 
if that professor you might 
have next semester thinks 
you’re subhuman?

So, please, if an on-campus 

site doesn’t work out, stop by 
my apartment, Mr. Spencer, 
and bring your compatriots. 
I’ll make you some coffee, 
which you are free to throw 
out because it was made by 
somebody several skin tones 
darker than you. You can make 
your own cup after; I know you 
live a life of fear. I can’t relate.

Trigger warning: description of 
sexual assault
I

n 
the 
Hindu 
epic 

“Mahabharata,” 
a 

prominent turning point 

occurs 
when 
the 
princess 

Draupadi 
is 
inadvertently 

gambled away by her husband 
to his evil cousins. She is 
dragged in front of the entire 
kingdom and disrobed to be 
assaulted. Though she yells 
at her husband in anger, she 
doesn’t fight back against her 
assailant. Instead, she prays to 
the Lord Krishna, who blesses 
her with infinitely long cloth 
for her sari, so she cannot be 
fully disrobed.

***

I was the type of girl whose 

reputation preceded her. In the 
Indian-American 
community 

at the University of Michigan, 
I was the girl who partied too 
hard, who’d hooked up with too 
many guys.

We met at a party my 

freshman year and I already 
knew who you were. You were 
the type of guy whose reputation 
preceded him, too. In the 
Indian-American 
community, 

people called you an asshole.

I always liked the bad boys. 

And you were the worst.

Over the next few weeks, 

we would sneak away to talk 
alone at parties and make out 
in the corner. You told me I was 
different. You told me I was “so 
much better than all these other 
Indian girls, so much less of a 
prude.” You attempted to uplift 
me by putting down countless 
other women in our community. I 
laughed along.

You took me back to your 

fraternity house after a party 
on Halloween. I had gone as a 
Disney princess and you didn’t 
have a costume. It was late, and 
it was dark, and I didn’t know 
that part of town very well. Your 
roommates were smoking weed 
and blasting Lil’ Wayne. You led 
me into your room, to your bed 
and I followed. You reminded 
me that I was pretty for a brown 
girl, carefree for a brown girl, 
chill for a brown girl. I accepted 
these as compliments.

We began to fool around a 

bit. In a few minutes, you easily 

unpinned the costume that I had 
taken an hour to assemble. No one 
had ever taken as keen an interest 
in my body before, and I was 
flattered. I was content to just let 
you look at me. I was 17, and you 
made me feel, for the first time in 
my life, beautiful.

But I was 17, and I barely 

knew you. You looked at me, all 
of me, and your eyes told me you 
wanted more. I had never done 
more than this. I had received 
enough of your approval tonight. 
I wanted to stop here, while I 
was still comfortable, while I 
was still happy. South Quad was 
30 minutes away, and I didn’t 
want to make that journey alone. 
I asked you to walk me home. 
You asked me to have sex with 
you instead.

I said no, and started gathering 

my costume strewn across the 
floor. You asked again.

I said no, but I didn’t want to 

come off too forceful. I didn’t 
want you to suddenly think I 
wasn’t “carefree” or “chill.” You 
asked again.

I said no, and I asked you 

to please take me home. This 
was before the days of Uber 
and Lyft, and I couldn’t trust 
my tipsy freshman self to find 
my way home on my own. You 
asked again.

I said no, but this time you cut 

me off. You said you would take 
me home, but only after we had 
sex. You asked again.

I said no, but this time you 

reminded me that I didn’t really 
have a choice. You said if I wanted 
to get home safe, we had to have 
sex first. You hovered closely over 
me, giving me no room to escape. 
You asked again.

I said yes, and I have chosen to 

forget the rest.

***

You and I had bonded earlier 

that night over a shared interest 
in Hinduism. But Lord Krishna 
didn’t bring me more cloth that 
night, like he did for Draupadi. 
Prayer isn’t always practical 
advice, and our faith ultimately 
gave us little guidance on notions 
of consent and assault.

The secular aspects of our 

culture didn’t help either. The 
Indian- 
and 
Hindu-American 

communities 
are 
notoriously 

conservative when it comes to 
sex and gender roles. My parents 
never gave me “the talk,” and 
maybe yours didn’t either. In 
my family, the men make all the 
decisions, and maybe it’s the 

same in yours too. Even Draupadi 
was treated as just an object to 
be gambled away, and it seems 
not much has changed in the 
millennia since.

My family doesn’t think I 

should date someone unless I’m 
going to marry them. My mom 
still thinks I’m a virgin. Any 
conversation that began to border 
on sex was immediately shrouded 
in judgment. Where was the room 
to talk about sexual assault?

And though so many of our 

peers claimed to be far more 
liberal than their parents, they 
have often still inherited the 
same judgment and exercised 
it on people like you and me, 
people who in their view partied 
or hooked up too much. At the 
University, being part of the 
Indian-American 
community 

meant 
navigating 
constant 

judgment 
and 
moral 
double 

standards. 
Having 
sex 
was 

rebellious; talking about it was 
taboo and would inevitably lead to 
slut-shaming. Sexual assault was 
something we opposed in theory, 
but wouldn’t dare acknowledge in 
our community.

Our parents had so many 

rules for us growing up, and our 
peers in college weren’t much 
better. By breaking their rules, I 
thought I was rebelling against 
our community. You probably 
thought you were rebelling too, 
but you broke me instead.

***

I walked home after sunrise 

wearing your T-shirt, the Greek 
letters displayed proudly across 
my chest. I kept that T-shirt, 
perhaps in denial, in the back of 
my closet for the better part of 
a decade. If a friend ever saw it, 
I’d tell them about how I’d stolen 
it from some random frat guy 
freshman year.

I finally threw your T-shirt 

away last year. Cloth may have 
been a physical barrier for 
Draupadi, but it wasn’t going 
to keep hiding my experience. 
Our community cannot keep 
wrapping 
up 
sexual 
assault 

with infinite cloth, pretending it 
doesn’t exist.

COURTESY OF GROOVE

Groove to rock the masses 
at Michigan Theater show

You’re 
walking 
out 
of 

Mason Hall as you make your 
way toward Hatcher. You hear 
rattles and rhythms pounding 
from the heart of the Diag. 
These rattles and 
rhythms express 
a 
cohesive 

unity — a unity 
of 
drumming, 

cheering 
and 

meticulous 
beats. 
No, 
it’s 

not the Michigan 
Drum Line, and 
no, 
you’re 
not 

making it up in 
your head. It’s 
the 
eccentric 

musical 
group 

rocking out on 
trash cans and a 
step ladder: It’s Groove, and 
it’s the sound you’ve been 
waiting to hear all semester.

A 
night 
filled 
with 

alternative methods of music 
and 
entertainment, 
Groove 

will be taking over Michigan 
Theater tomorrow for their 
concert “Drumpalooza.”

More 
than 
a 
group 
of 

creative 
minds, 
Groove 
is 

designed to bring new talent 
to the campus’s music scene. 
They believe their personality 
is built on extremes, ranging 
from simple and accessible to 
complex and striking.

The best way to describe 

the work of the 32 Groovers 
would to be a mix of The 
Blue Man Group and Stomp, 
however, the group sets out to 
make an independent name for 
themselves.

“Groove pushes the limit 

of what people consider to 
be music and instruments ... 
Any of the groups we compare 
ourselves to are going in 
different directions than us,” 
said College of Engineering 
sophomore 
and 
Groove’s 

Music 
Director 
Bryan 

Schildcrout.

Although drumming is their 

core, the group seeks to find 
talent outside of percussion. 
Whether it be dancing or 
playing the trumpet, Groove is 
all about seeing “what unique 
quality you can bring to us.”

Groove 
still 
celebrates 

their 
focus 
in 
percussion, 

meanwhile forming a mosaic 
of 
unique 
and 
talented 

students. But that doesn’t stop 

the group from recruiting 
drummers.“There 
are 

members in our group who 
have never touched a drum 
before,” Schildcrout said. So 
as hard-working and music-
sharing Groovers do, they 
teach their new members how 
to drum.

Before Groove, College of 

Engineering 
freshman 
and 

new 
Groover 

Ryan 
“Bruce” 

Mersol-Barg 
only 
played 
a 

solo 
drum 
set. 

But 
joining 

a 
group 
with 

coordination and 
trust, 
Mersol-

Barg 
learned 

what it means to 
give and take and 
to become aware 
of all the features 
that 
happen 

during a performance.

“There 
are 
a 
lot 
of 

things you have to learn … 
Learning to play with other 
percussionists is challenging 
in some regards. It’s definitely 
something different, and some 
of the songs can get complex. 
You have to trust people to be 
on time and make sure that 
you’re with them. It’s all very 
coordinated … it’s fun, but 
it’s a challenge,” Mersol-Barg 
said.

Additionally, 
with 
so 

many 
ideas, 
skills 
and 

talents, Groove has to find 
organization through all the 
craze.

“The best part of Groove is 

the creativity,” said LSA senior 
and Groove President Hannah 
Buck. “But the hardest part 
is harnessing that creativity.” 
This harnessing translates to 
ensuring that members come 
to scheduled rehearsals and 
giving deadlines for newly 
written music pieces. 

A 
myriad 
of 
artistry, 

Groovers 
build 
their 
own 

sets, share their expertise 
and write their own songs and 
choreography –– they’re also 
known to be “innovators.”

“You are not just a player 

in this grand scheme you’re 
joining,” 
Mersol-Barg 
said. 

“You’re in it. And you’re in 
every part of it.” The same 
could be said for the audience’s 
attention, soaking in all the 
talent the group puts forth.

Creative, 
explosive 
and 

most definitely engaging, the 
audience can relate to the 

performance because of their 
relatability and accessibility. 
I walked into their rehearsal 
space to see shopping carts, 
pots, pans, buckets and trash 
cans –– these everyday objects 
are used as the foundation to 
produce power-house, raging 
beats. And that’s what makes 
Groove’s sound so special.

“People would expect to 

come to our show and just see 
just 10 trashcans, but that’s 
not at all what our shows are,” 
Buck said. “Groove is more 
than drumming on trash cans 
and more than drumming.” 
Their past shows’ lineups have 
included wild piano pieces, 
improv, 
dance 
numbers, 

blacklight 
shows, 
funny 

skits and overall incredible 
instrumentation.

Regardless 
of 
what 

instrument or ordinary object 
Groove is rockin’ out with, 
through their willingness to 
spread musical talent and to 
use of all kinds of materials, 
they prove to their viewers 
that anyone can make music 
and anyone can be a performer.

“Groove takes down the 

barrier 
between 
audience 

and performer,” Schildcrout 
said. “I think our music is 
something that people see and 
say ‘We could be doing that.’”

Filled with heart-pounding 

beats and intricate musical 
scores, 
Groovers 
continue 

to be risk-taking, passionate 
and fluorescent performers; 
and most importantly, they’re 
a tight-knit group of friends 
who yearn to share their love 
for art.

Transnational mystery 
center of new Allende book

Acclaimed 
Chilean-

American 
author 
Isabel 

Allende is known for her 
sprawling, multigenerational 
and multinational narratives, 
and 
her 
new 

novel 
“In 
the 

Midst of Winter” 
is no exception. 
Allende’s 
classic 
blend 

of cultures and 
personalities, 
best 
known 
in 

South American 
epic “The House of the Spirits” 
and 
California 
saga 
“The 

Japanese Lover,” is at full force 
in her newest work. But this 
novel, published in Spanish 
earlier this year and premeired 
in English on October 31, 
adds an unexpected “murder 
mystery” twist to her familiar 
style.

Allende’s latest story spans 

decades and global borders, 
but it begins closer to home, 
in 
present-day 
Brooklyn 

during a snowstorm. Richard, 
an 
American 
professor 
at 

NYU, and Lucia, his Chilean 
tenant, shiver through the 
storm in an old brownstone 
until Richard ventures out 
and gets in a car crash. Drama 
ensues with the other car’s 
driver, 
young 
Guatemalan 

immigrant Evelyn, and the 
three characters are thrown 
together in a wintry adventure 
that 
has 
it 
all: 
romance, 

murder and intrigue.

If it all sounds like a little 

much, don’t worry — Allende is 
famous for her melodramatic 
plots, but she brings such 
humanity to her characters 
that you’ll be swept along for 
the ride. All that melodrama, 
particularly 
the 
murder 

mystery that quickly takes 
center stage in the three New 
Yorkers’ lives, serves as a 
device to throw these unlikely 
companions 
together 
and 

drive the plot forward. All the 
excitement makes for a page-
turner, 
but 
Allende 
deftly 

juggles the novel’s larger-
than-life 
events, 
capturing 

their gravity without slipping 
into schmaltz. This should 
come as no surprise to her 
many fans, who are familiar 
with the measured melodrama 
of Allende’s novels. In her 
own 
life, 
the 
author 
has 

experienced 
far-ranging 

global 
travel, 
untimely 

deaths, political uprisings and 
exile — who better to write 
melodrama?

More than anything, it’s the 

human insight and empathy 
Allende imbues her characters 
with that grounds the story. 
The book’s title comes from 

a famous Albert 
Camus 
quote, 

cited 
as 
an 

epigraph 
at 

the start of the 
novel: 
“In 
the 

midst of winter, 
I finally found 
there was within 
me an invincible 

summer.” Allende uses the 
quote as a simple double 
entendre, evoking both the 
story’s 
snowy 
setting 
and 

the inner strength of her 
characters, who bloom over 

the course of the narrative.

While she only chose to 

feature the beginning of the 
Camus quote in her epigraph, 
the 
French 
philosopher 

actually continued his winter 
metaphor, “For it says that no 
matter how hard the world 
pushes against me, within me, 
there’s 
something 
stronger 

–– something better, pushing 
right back.” This invocation 
of 
personal 
resilience 

certainly applies to Allende’s 
characters, who are pummeled 
by tempests far more serious 
than the winter storm that sets 
the story into motion. Evelyn, 
Richard and Lucia tell their life 
stories to one another during 
the novel’s long winter nights, 
and the narrative ricochets 
between the three characters’ 
pasts and present. All have 
faced tragedies that go beyond 

life’s ordinary challenges, and 
many of these experiences give 
a face to global and historical 
issues, from domestic violence 
to Chile’s brutal dictatorship, 
Central American gangs to 
U.S. migration.

At first glance, some of 

the narrative seems ripped 
straight from the headlines, 
but 
Allende 
brings 
real 

compassion 
and 
humanity 

to 
her 
characters. 
Rather 

than 
reducing 
Evelyn, 
in 

particular, 
to 
a 
powerless 

victim or “illegal” migrant, 
as many Central Americans 
are 
portrayed 
in 
popular 

depictions, 
the 
novelist 

chooses 
to 
highlight 
her 

remarkable grit in the face of 
overwhelming adversity.

While the novel contains 

considerable 
violence 
and 

suffering, it remains full of joy 
for life. This celebratory spirit 
is enhanced, not diminished, 
by the character’s suffering: a 
bout with breast cancer results 
in a newfound appreciation 
for life’s daily pleasures, and 
long-term 
loneliness 
gives 

way to a rewarding late-in-life 
romance.

This joy is often enhanced 

by 
faith 
in 
something 

beyond 
each 
character’s 

pain and crises. Allende is 
unconcerned with the type 
of faith, preferring to show 
the diversity and richness of 
global belief systems, from 
Afro-Brazilian 
Candomblé 

to 
Chilean 
Catholicism 
to 

indigenous 
Guatemalan 

syncretism.

“In the Midst of Winter” 

shows Allende at the top of her 
form, applying her brilliant, 
sensory prose to a whirlwind of 
destinations in the Americas, 
from 
the 
gray 
streets 
of 

Santiago to a small indigenous 
village in Guatemala, a New 
York City snowstorm to bright, 
boisterous Rio de Janeiro. 
In 
the 
novel’s 
colorful, 

interwoven 
tales, 
Allende’s 

most 
salient 
message 
can 

be 
found 
largely 
between 

the lines: a condemnation of 
modern-day isolationism and 
xenophobia in her adopted 
home, 
the 
United 
States. 

Allende expertly weaves these 
seemingly disparate narratives 
together, showing our riotous, 
divided hemisphere for what 
it really is, a place connected 
by so much love, blood and 
history that no one country 
can ever really isolate itself.

UMS’s ‘Messiah’ to kick
off Hill’s holiday season

In 1879, before UMS existed, 

a group of church musicians 
got together and sang choruses 
from Handel’s “Messiah.” A 
year and a half after that, UMS 
was 
founded 

by 
those 
same 

people. 
Every 

year 
since 

then, UMS has 
presented 
the 

oratorio in some 
form, 
and 
this 

year, 
for 
the 

139th year in a 
row, 
UMS 
will 

be 
presenting 

Handel’s 
“Messiah” 
this 

weekend at Hill 
Auditorium.

“It’s 
one 
of 

those 
traditions 

that goes back to the very 
beginning,” 
said 
Scott 

Hanoian, Musical Director and 
Conductor of the UMS Choral 
Union, in an interview with The 
Daily. Hanoian, who has held 
this position for the past three 
years, is a University alum of 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance, where he studied under 
Jerry Blackstone, who is also 
his predecessor as Musical 
Director and Conductor.

“He was my teacher, so we 

have a lot of the same thought 
processes when making music,” 
Hanonian 
said. 
“Everybody 

brings 
their 
own 
style 
to 

certain things. I have my own 
preferences, 
and 
I’ve 
been 

working them into the chorus 
and orchestra throughout my 
tenure here.” 

The 
Choral 
Union 
is 
a 

Grammy-winning 
ensemble 

comprised of 175 voices — it is 
open to adults and students by 
audition.

“You are able to register 

for Choral Union as a class,” 
Hanoian said. “It’s not part 
of the School of Music — it’s 
through UMS, and is also a class 

at the University of Michigan.”

The Choral Union sings a 

series of concerts throughout 
the season.

“We’ll be hired by places 

like the Detroit Symphony 
Orchestra, 
the 
Toledo 

Symphony 
Orchestra 
and 

the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Symphony 

to do concerts with them on 

their 
seasons,” 

Hanoian 
explained. “And, 
then in addition 
to ‘Messiah,’ we 
will do our own 
UMS 
produced 

concerts.”

This particular 

performance 
is 

in 
collaboration 

with 
the 
Ann 

Arbor Symphony. 
With the holiday 
season in place, 
the 
concert 

makes 
it 
“the 

thing to do” to 

for many members of the Ann 
Arbor community. The 3,500 
seat auditorium is full every 
year.

“It’s 
one 
of 
Handel’s 

masterpieces, so many people 
come to hear the music. Others 
come for the story,” Hanoian 
said. “It’s got a lot of drama 
and excitement in it. There’s 
joy, and sadness, and pain and 
sorrow. 
There’s 
exuberance 

all the way through it. It’s got 
a little bit of everything for 
everybody.”

What makes it special, and 

separates it as an oratorio, is 
that it encompasses more than 
what a lot of Christmas music 
covers, like the birth of Jesus.

“The words cover a lot more 

of (Jesus’s) life,” Hanoian said. 
“And the other thing is, the 
music itself is just so exciting 
that if you’re not a Christian, 
or if you don’t go to Church, 
or if you don’t believe any of 
it, you can still find a place in 
‘Messiah’ because the music is 
so fantastic.”

With its annual presence, the 

timelessness of “Messiah” has a 
deeper meaning for many Ann 

Arborites. There are members 
of the community that have 
been attending for 30, even 40 
years.

“Ann Arbor has a history 

of 
supporting 
‘Messiah,’” 

Hanoian said. “We hear so 
many great stories about people 
who make Handel’s ‘Messiah’ a 
part of their holiday tradition 
every year.”

The loyalty of the audience 

is no surprise considering the 
assured excellence of each 
year’s performance.

“The choral union sings this 

piece unlike any other group 
that I’ve ever worked with,” 
Hanoian said. “They have deep 
passion for this music, and they 
sing it with such confidence, 
and so much color and drama, 

that it’s just a joy to conduct it. 
I would say that the audience 
picks up on it, and we pick up 
on that energy, and it’s just a 
blast.”

UMS presents 

Handel’s 
“Messiah”

Hill Auditorium

Saturday, 

December 2nd @ 

8 p.m.

Sunday, December 

3rd @ 2 p.m.

$16 to $40

In 1879, before 
UMS existed, a 
group of church 
musicians got 
together and 
sang choruses 
from Handel’s 

‘Messiah.’ A year 
and a half after 
that, UMS was 
founded by those 

same people

“When was the last time 

you listened to music with 
someone?” asked Howie Day 
in an email interview with 
The Daily.

I 
can’t 

remember. 
In 

anticipation 
of 

his 
upcoming 

show 
at 
The 

Ark, 
the 

acoustic-rocker 
corresponded 
with The Daily, 
and 
I’ve 
been 

asking 
myself 

his question ever since. It’s 
frustrating in its passive dig at 
the truth: There’s some music 
that exists to move, and it’s 
not often that people actually 
take the time to be moved by 
it. Day lives somewhere in 
this oasis, playing with a grit 
and vulnerability that doesn’t 
demand to be heard, but 
gently begs that you — at the 
very least — try.

“A show gives you a solid 

hour or so to get people to sit 
down and feel something,” 
Day wrote.

A wunderkind, Day has been 

playing piano since he was 
five, and he started gigs at just 
15. For someone still so young, 
he has an almost 20-year 
career backing him, making 
his concerts a rare melding 
of youth’s effervescence and 
wisdom’s skill.

“The live loop sampling 

songs (like ‘Bunnies’) are still 
interesting to me because 
they change night to night 
depending 
on 
the 
actual 

space and the energy/mood 
of the audience,” he wrote. “I 
also enjoy playing something 
somewhat loud and cathartic 
followed 
by 
something 

very quiet and vulnerable. 
This makes for a dynamic 
experience 
for 
me, 
and 

hopefully the audience, too, 
and is another thing missing 
from popular music today.”

You probably know him 

from “Collide.” A colossal hit 
from his 2003 album, Stop All 
the World Now, it embodies 
all the inexplicable, stunning, 
heartbreaking 
longing 
that 

was 
early 

2000s 
singer-

songwriting. The 
intro still gives 
me goosebumps. 
But, it’s not Day 
anymore, 
and 

that’s OK (dare I 
say, for the best).

“After that, I 

found myself in 
a changing and 

declining industry that was 
solely interested in reprising 
that moment,” Day explained. 
“Since then, it has been a 
decade of fighting and falling 
out of favor with an industry 

that 
doesn’t 
understand 

itself.”

He’s an underdog, and it’s 

this innate scrappiness that 
makes Day so endearing.

“As much as I have been 

discouraged 
by 
the 
way 

the 
music 
‘industry’ 
has 

evolved over the last twenty 
years, 
it 
has 
nonetheless 

come 
with 
some 
pretty 

amazing 
opportunities 
and 

experiences,” he wrote. “One 
of my favorite experiences I 

find myself in over and over 
again is being isolated in some 
far-off place at the end of a 
tour, and existing in this space 
where I’m purely an observer, 
as my own life is wildly 
decelerating from weeks or 
months of performing and 
traveling non-stop. I see and 
hear things so much more 
vividly in these moments, and 
it’s amazing. Any art form 
should strive to gently (or not-
so-gently) guide people to this 
place.”

Having worked long enough 

to be disillusioned by human 
nature, Day rejects the notion 
that 
there’s 
anything 
to 

disillusioned by.

“Human beings inspire me. 

Their 
resilience, 
curiosity, 

empathy, 
and 
willingness,” 

he wrote. “We live in this 
crazy world, and most of us 
still find the motivation to 
make it happen, whatever ‘it’ 
is. We’ve been at it for tens 
of thousands of years, but the 
moment we find ourselves in, 
now, where everything is just 
changing and progressing at 
breakneck speeds, is also very 
interesting. I feel pretty lucky 
to be alive to see it.”

Looking forward, despite 

pressures 
to 
recreate 
his 

stardom circa 2003, Day is 
fervent and ready for wherever 
his life may turn.

“I’m always dreaming of 

new possibilities, new paths,” 
he explained. “I don’t know 
where I’m going; it’s a road trip 
with no defined destination, 
no directions. I feel beyond 
lucky that I get to live the kind 
of life that meanders! I don’t 
even know how much longer 
I’ll treat music as my primary 
thing. There’s lots to discover 
out there, and that’s exciting.”

Howie Day will play at The 

Ark this Sunday at 7:30 p.m. 
Go with a heart wide open 
and listen to his music with 
someone else.

A wake-up call in the heart of college basketball

C

HAPEL HILL, NC — In 
Chapel Hill, basketball 
isn’t so much sport as it 

is religion.

The 

hardwood 
floors 
carry a 
little more 
weight. 
The rafters 
preach 
hymns 
more than 
they list 
numbers. 
The sea of 
Carolina 
blue overwhelms. There’s more 
history in the building than in 
some museums.

Last Sunday’s loss to 

Michigan State and an 
embarrassing 45 point total 
isn’t so much disappointment 
as it is sacrilege. 

“It wasn’t very pleasant,” 

said North Carolina coach Roy 
Williams, in the aftermath of 
his team’s performance against 
the Spartans. “We got back at 
6:30 Monday, I laid down at 
7:15 a.m. and got up at 9 o’clock 
because it wasn’t doing any 
good. Then I got a haircut to 
see if that would help me. I was 
willing to try anything.”

A bounceback, conversely, 

isn’t so much desired as it is 
required.

The Wolverines took their 

lumps in Wednesday night’s 
86-71 defeat, a game that 
wasn’t nearly as close the 
score indicates. They proved 
incapable of competing with a 
team fueled by vengeance and 
its own home crowd. Like an 
elite program does, the Tar 
Heels responded.

In what is becoming an 

annual occurrence, the 
Wolverines got beat down by a 
superior team. But here’s the 
thing: That’s OK.

In the Big Ten/ACC 

Challenge a year ago, Michigan 
lost at home to Virginia Tech 

only one week after losing by 
15 to South Carolina. Ten days 
later, it fell to Lonzo Ball and 
UCLA by 18. 

Few even batted an eyelash 

— and for good reason. You 
play these games to win, sure. 
But above all, you play these 
games to dig deep and learn 
something about your team. 
Which is why, when Michigan 
coach John Beilein said he 
just hoped Michigan “would 
hang around” against North 
Carolina, he truly meant it. 
With much of his team in flux, 
he likely didn’t expect it to go 
into Chapel Hill and beat a top-
15 team on the road.

They didn’t “hang around,” 

of course. Michigan got run out 
of the gym by a team that was 
not only better but hungrier.

Early on, Michigan held 

its own. With the Tar Heels 
grasping a slim 34-32 lead, 
fifth-year senior forward 
Duncan Robinson grabbed an 
outlet pass and attacked the 
fast break. He elevated and 
laid the ball up, and when the 
easy layup fell off the front of 
the rim, the Michigan offense 
fell off a cliff. For the next 
30 minutes, North Carolina’s 
pace and relentlessness 
overwhelmed a lackadaisical 
Michigan team. North Carolina 
went on a 36-9 run to open up 
a 29-point lead, and leave no 
doubt about the result.

“I don’t think we were ready 

for the quickness, speed and 
the precision they run with, 
and we weren’t locked in 
defensively, we just weren’t 
locked in,” Beilein said. “We 
laid an egg for most of the first 

half defensively, half the first 
half offensively, and I gotta 
find out really the reasons 
behind that.”

Certainly, there are real 

reasons for concern.

The Tar Heels played 

with energy, the Wolverines 
looked sloppy. The Tar Heels 
executed with precision, the 
Wolverines were stagnant. The 
Tar Heels fed off the crowd, 
the Wolverines looked like they 
wanted to be anywhere else.

Michigan lacked a 

competitive “grit,” as Beilein 
described. That’s what 
disappointed him most.

“They came out with a 

real vengeance towards us or 
towards the Big Ten,” Beilein 
said. “We did not answer, we 
couldn’t answer.”

While the Tar Heels — the 

defending national champions 
— are not afforded the same 
patience the Wolverines are 
fortunate to have. In Ann 
Arbor, the expectations are 
high, but basketball isn’t a 
religion.

Each of the past five seasons, 

Michigan has lost at least 
twice before conference play, 
but it has still made the NCAA 
Tournament in four of those 
five seasons, and the Sweet 
Sixteen in three of those 
five. This early-season play 
is always exploratory, and 
with two transfers and three 
freshmen playing prominent 
roles, this season was never 
going to be an exception.

Beilein played 11 players 

in the first 15 minutes of the 
game, and hopes to eventually 
cut down to eight or nine. All 

three point guards — freshman 
Eli Brooks, sophomore Zavier 
Simpson and fifth-year senior 
Jaaron Simmons — played at 
least nine minutes. Beilein 
hopes a clear leader emerges, 
and that he can reduce that 
rotation from three to two. And 
he’s still waiting for a player to 
step up and get a bucket when 
the offense bogs down. For 
Derrick Walton Jr. last season, 
it didn’t happen until February, 
aligning closely with when the 
team took off.

None of these changes, 

though, will happen until 
Beilein is good and ready.

“I don’t know who those 

next guys are. If you know, you 
guys can let me know. … Just 
watch this team grow, you’ll 
like what they do.”

For some fans, his patience 

is frustrating when it comes at 
the expense of blowout losses 
and underachievement. Yet 
given his track record, Beilein 
has earned the benefit of the 
doubt. 

That’s the big picture. Here’s 

the immediate reality.

This was their first major 

test, and there’s no escaping 
the fact that they failed it. 

For better or worse, the 

Wolverines have no time to 
sulk. They return home to play 
a feisty Indiana team Saturday, 
hit the road again to play Ohio 
State on Monday, then return 
back home for UCLA the 
following Saturday — all before 
capping the gauntlet in Austin 
the next Tuesday against 
Texas. It is a slate of games 
that Beilein has regularly 
referred to as “the toughest 
stretch.”

Like North Carolina a few 

days ago, Michigan got a wake-
up call of its own Wednesday 
night. Now it’s time for a 
response.

John Beilein and the Michigan men’s basketball team traveled to Chapel Hill, NC, on Wednesday night, only to come home with a 15-point loss to the Tar Heels.

Wolverines heading to Plymouth for exhibition with USNTDP

While 
preparing 
for 

Saturday’s 
exhibition 
game 

against 
the 
U.S. 
National 

Team Development Program, 
three Michigan hockey players 
eagerly await a package with 
championship rings. 

Prior to arriving in Ann 

Arbor, 
defenseman 
Quinn 

Hughes 
and 
forwards 
Josh 

Norris and Michael Pastujov 
spent the past two seasons as 
teammates in the USNTDP. The 
now-freshmen skated for the 
U-17 and U-18 teams, the latter 
of which finished with a gold 
medal — and rings — from the 
2017 U-18 World Championship 
in Slovakia. And in both 2016 
and 2017, all three won goal 
medals at the U-18 Five Nations 
Tournaments.

Last year, Norris led the U-18 

team with 51 points in 52 games 
and Hughes followed closely 
with 47 points — on nine goals 
and 38 assists — in 56 games. 
Their stellar résumés turned 
the pair into two of the highest-
touted prospects to join the 
Wolverines this season.

And Saturday, they will lace 

up against the team that taught 
them to improve their skills, 
form lifelong friendships and 
gave them an opportunity to 
represent their country.

“It’s 
kind 
of 
like 
a 

homecoming,” Norris said.

Michigan 
will 
head 
20 

minutes east to Plymouth for 
the first time in its 18 years 
of annual meetings against 
the USNTDP, but this contest 
wasn’t supposed to happen in 
the first place.

Not originally on the regular 

season 
calendar, 
Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson decided to 
add the matchup to the open 
weekend between series against 
Ohio State and Michigan State. 
And it couldn’t have come at a 
better time.

The Wolverines are coming 

off a two-game weekend in 
which they were outscored 
eight to three and swept for 
the first time all season at the 
hands of the then-15th-ranked 

Buckeyes. In its last six games 
— all against conference foes 
— Michigan has posted a 1-3-2 
record.

Pearson cites a need to face 

the right opponent to get back 
on track, and he believes he 
picked the perfect one.

“I’m very happy that we 

scheduled it because we need a 
game to get that bitter taste out 
of our mouth and just to play,” 
Pearson said. “They’re a good 
partner. I enjoy the program, 
it’s a good game for us.”

Throughout what Pearson 

refers to as a “work week,” his 
icemen have taken that motto 
in full stride, displaying an 
intensity in practice that was 
lacking in Saturday’s 5-1 loss.

“They’ve worked hard and 

the energy level’s been up, 
especially when we don’t have 
much to look forward to this 
week,” Pearson said.

Added Hughes: “Back to the 

basics and work hard. Obviously, 
last weekend was unacceptable, 
so we have to start over. A new 

start, a fresh start, whatever 
you want to call it. We’re going 
to have a good five days of hard 
work here and then against the 
U.S. team. It’s just a good week 
for us to focus and get all our 
priorities straight.”

Though already focusing on 

the looming Spartan home-
and-home series Dec. 7 and 8 
— and a hopeful return to the 
win column in Big Ten play — 
the Wolverines can’t overlook 
the task at hand against the 
USNTDP, especially following 
disappointing results against 
Ohio State.

The developmental program 

targets and trains elite youth 
hockey players under the age 
of 18 for USA Hockey. Over 
the years, it has produced 47 
Michigan 
players, 
including 

10 current skaters — some of 
whom have played with present 
members of the U-18 team, 
making the game that much 
more personal.

“I think they look forward 

to it,” Pearson said. “Most of 

the guys that come out of that 
program really appreciate what 
it’s done for them and they really 
have a sense of nationalism. 
They really play up the ‘USA.’

“I think they have a huge 

appreciation for the program 
and what they’ve done. We’ve 
got to convince them ‘Wow, 
you’ve got to play hard and 
we’ve got to beat them.’ You’re 
friends until the puck drops and 
then it’s business.”

Hughes notes the impact on 

player growth and attention 
to detail as the main aspects 
that lead to players excelling 
in 
college 
and, 
eventually, 

professional leagues.

“I owe a lot to the program,” 

Hughes said. “The development 
there, you don’t get anywhere 
else. It’s the best in the world. 
You see how they pump out 
players 
every 
year 
— 
it’s 

ridiculous. It’s a business there 
and they treat it like a job. 
It’s kind of like pro hockey, 
so it’s really good for you to 
experience as young kids, so 

when you come to (college), 
you’re ready.”

Both 
Norris 
and 
Hughes 

believe there was a bigger 
adjustment from youth hockey 
to the USNTDP than from the 
junior league to the collegiate 
level — a true testament to the 
development team steering its 
players in the right direction.

And 
after 
playing 
20 

games against older and more 
experienced college opponents 
last season, the freshmen say 
the program helped them make 
an immediate impact in the 
Michigan lineup.

“I feel like that was my 

freshman year,” Hughes said. “I 
feel like this is my sophomore 
year right now and I didn’t 
notice a transition at all. They 
made it really hard for us there, 
so when I came here — not that 
they don’t make it hard here — it 
was a little bit easier.”

Added Norris: “Learning how 

to play with different players 
and becoming mentally tougher. 
It’s not the easiest the first year. 

You’re 16 and playing against 
18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, so I 
think just finding ways to get 
through adversity and stuff like 
that. It’s a big deal to learn from 
that stuff and grow.”

Because 
of 
the 
team’s 

familiarity with the opponent, 
it would be easy to have a 
different-than-usual mentality 
in the locker room leading 
up to the game. But after 
recent setbacks, the team is 
approaching this weekend no 
different than any other.

“I’ve been involved in a lot 

of them over the years when 
I was here at Michigan and 
some years it was hard to play 
in them because you’re playing 
the high school kids,” Pearson 
said. “It’s a no-lose for them, 
but you’re expected to beat 
them. Sometimes you’d look 
past it, but not this year. I think 
because of the way things went 
last weekend and because of 
who we have the weekend after, 
it’s an opportunity for us to get 
our stuff together.”

Skating on the USA Hockey 

Arena rink in Plymouth for 
the first time since donning 
the USNTDP’s trademark red, 
white and blue sweaters — 
and mere days before Norris, 
Hughes and Pastujov receive 
their championship rings in the 
mail — will certainly be special 
for the three freshmen as well 
as the seven other players 
returning to their roots.

But even that — and the fact 

the exhibition doesn’t count 
toward 
Michigan’s 
overall 

record — doesn’t mean the 
Wolverines will take the game 
against the youngsters lightly.

“I played against Michigan 

last year,” Hughes said. “I 
thought it was a pretty big deal 
for me. I kind of know what 
those guys are thinking right 
now. I loved it last year, this 
year it’s probably not as cool, 
but it’s a game and we’re going 
to try 100 percent. It doesn’t 
really matter who we’re playing.

“I know all those guys and 

obviously I had a lot of good 
memories in that rink, so it’s 
going to be cool and I’m looking 
forward to it.”

Big Ten beckons as Wolverines are looking to rebound

It’s the season of giving, and 

boy could the Big Ten use some 
luck after this week.

The Big Ten/ACC Challenge 

came and went, 
and it was an 
unsightly scene 
for the former. 
The 
Big 
Ten 

posted a 2-11 
record against 
its 
fellow 

Power 
Five 

conference 
foes, unveiling 
harsh 
signs 

of 
the 
down 

year that many 
expected. 
Now 
for 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team, with a newly-
designed Big Ten schedule, 
the first of two December 
conference 
matchups 
begins 

Saturday against Indiana and 
both teams desperately need a 
pick-me-up victory. 

The 
Hoosiers 
(4-3) 
have 

essentially been a captainless 

ship thus far, with seven players 
averaging seven or more points. 
Guard Robert Johnson is the 
closest qualifier to be recognized 
as Indiana’s leader, ranking first 
on the team in scoring with 14.1 
points per game. The bulky, 195-
pound senior is the only Hoosier 
averaging more than 25 minutes 
per 
game 
and 
could 
pose 

the greatest challenge to the 
Wolverines (6-2), who remain 
in limbo over who will take over 
the point guard reins.

Johnson 
was 
especially 

impressive in Indiana’s narrow 
91-81 loss to No. 1 Duke on 
Wednesday, 
showcasing 

an 
expansive 
range 
while 

contributing 
tough 
defense 

on the Blue Devils’ backcourt 
amidst an otherwise porous 
defensive effort by his team.

On Saturday, the direction 

of the contest may ultimately 
depend 
on 
which 
Indiana 

shows up — the one that lost to 
Indiana State at home by 21, or 
the one that was neck-and-neck 
with Duke for almost a full 40 
minutes.

This volatility, though, is all 

too familiar to Michigan. After 
a nearly flawless performance 

against 
UC 
Riverside 
last 

Sunday, the Wolverines looked 
like 
they 
somehow 
picked 

up more momentum against 
No. 13 North 
Carolina 
with 

an astonishing 
8-for-8 
start 

from 
the 

field. 
The 

incredulous 
shooting 
was 

short-lived, 
as 
Michigan 

followed 
that 

start 
with 
a 

more 
typical 

20-for-58 finish en route to an 
86-71 defeat.

“I 
think 
North 
Carolina 

might be that good, and we’re 
definitely not that bad. But we 
certainly played poorly,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
after the loss. “... We (shot 
well), too. But we all of a sudden 
went out of that and got a little 
uncharacteristic of ourselves 
and we got what we deserved.”

Added junior forward Moritz 

Wagner: “I don’t like to say 
that 
(we’re 
young) 
because 

that sounds like an excuse. … 
We can’t allow that stuff. That 

just can’t happen. We’re a great 
group and we always talk about 
how great our chemistry is. 
We’ve gotta show that on the 

floor.”

A 
15-point 

defeat 
to 
a 

college basketball 
powerhouse isn’t a 
cause for concern, 
of 
course. 
The 

Wolverines’ 
torrid 
scoring 

pace 
initially 

illustrated 
their 

potential to attack 
from all spots on 

the floor. Wagner waltzed freely 
in the paint, Charles Matthews 
continued creating space for his 
shots and Michigan was passing 

well and finding open looks 
from beyond the arc — they just 
weren’t falling like they should 
have.

An 
obvious 
weak 
point 

the matchup against the Tar 
Heels 
revealed, 
however, 

is 
inconsistent 
frontcourt 

defense from Wagner and fifth-
year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson. 
North 
Carolina’s 

Luke Maye had a field day 
overpowering Robinson, and 
Wagner struggled to corral 
defensive rebounds over the 
more-athletic Theo Pinson and 
the towering Garrison Brooks 
and Sterling Manley. Indiana’s 
De’Ron 
Davis 
and 
Juwan 

Morgan may not carry the same 
finesse as the Tar Heels big 

men, but they will be the biggest 
front court duo the Wolverines 
have faced so far.

“We weren’t ready for the 

quickness, the speed and the 
precision that they run with,” 
Beilein said. “We weren’t locked 
in defensively, we just weren’t 
locked in. I can’t tell you why. 
We’ve seen it before, we’ve gotta 
shore it up.”

Eight games into the season, 

Beilein is yet to solidify an 
eight- or nine-player rotation 
that would put the cynical fan at 
ease, even against a rebuilding 
team like the Hoosiers. With 
Big Ten season starting early, 
having that decided quickly is 
becoming the fine line between 
winning and losing.

Junior forward Moritz Wagner finished with 20 points, but it wasn’t enough to lead the Wolverines past North Carolina.

Michigan must extend its rotation

or risk running out of gas 

A

mong the problems 
exposed in the Michigan 
women‘s basketball 

team‘s loss to No. 3 Notre Dame 
on Wednesday: depth, or lack 
thereof.

The 

Wolverines 
scored all 
of six bench 
points, four 
of them 
coming 
after coach 
Kim Barnes 
Arico 
emptied the 
bench once 
the Fighting 
Irish stretched their lead to 20.

When the game was still 

within reach, Michigan was 
locked into a seven-woman 
rotation. Freshman guard Deja 
Church and sophomore forward 
Kayla Robbins were the only 
players coming off the bench for 
any sustained time.

All five Wolverine starters 

played at least 30 minutes. 
Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
played 39, senior forward Jillian 
Dunston totaled 38, and junior 
center Hallie Thome notched 
34. Church was the only bench 
player with over five minutes.

Given that no Notre Dame 

player went over 35 minutes, it 
may not be a coincidence that 
Michigan expired at the start of 
the fourth quarter.

“I think that (our strength 

coach) Jamie (Preiss) has 
conditioned us very well so 
I think that we’re prepared 
for anything,” Thome said 
after the game. “It wasn’t like 
fatigue physically, I think it was 
mentally just always having to 
locate Arike (Ogunbowale) and 
just be aware of where everyone 
is.”

There’s no doubt that trying 

to stop Ogunbowale — who 
finished with 32 points for the 

Fighting Irish — took a mental 
toll on Michigan. But the notion 
that there was no physical 
fatigue at all, well, that’s a 
tough sell.

The Wolverines were 

scrambling on defense all 
night, not just to keep up 
with Ogunbowale, but to stay 
competitive on the boards. 
They were outrebounded by 
a 42-28 margin, but given 
that Notre Dame had a clear 
size advantage, it could have 
been worse. To stay that close, 
Michigan bracketed the 6-foot-
4 Jessica Shepard off the ball 
for the early part of the game. 
That left the Wolverines 
scrambling for rotations 
on nearly every defensive 

possession.

They scrapped that strategy 

before the first half was over, 
but sprinting around the floor 
like their lives depended on 
it had to have some effect — 
especially when nobody had a 
chance to catch their breath.

Right now, Michigan doesn’t 

seem to have the depth to 
compete with the nation’s best. 
Even Robbins, who has flashed 
the ability to play Dunston’s 
role as a defensive grinder and 
off-ball catalyst, was trusted 
with all of five minutes on 
Wednesday.

As for the rest of the bench, 

the Wolverines are still waiting 

for someone to emerge.

Freshman point guard 

Priscilla Smeenge got two 
minutes of playing time on 
Wednesday when the game was 
still attainable, but that was a 
flash in the pan. She’s had just 
five minutes of playing time this 
season.

As for sophomore guard 

Akienreh Johnson, Barnes 
Arico has yet to trust her 
for more than a few minutes 
each game and didn’t play 
her against the Fighting 
Irish until garbage time. 
Ditto for sophomore forward 
KeAsja Peace. Junior forward 
Samantha Trammel has gotten 
on the floor for only three 
minutes all year. One of these 
players has to emerge as a 
reliable rotation option for 
the team to compete against 
tougher competition.

They can’t depend on 

Flaherty to play 39 minutes a 
night — that’s an unreasonable 
ask for anyone, even the 
team‘s cornerstone. She‘s 
averaging 37.3 minutes per 
game right now and four of 
Michigan’s games have been 
against pushovers. What‘s that 
number going to look like once 
conference play picks up?

This can’t continue, or the 

Wolverines will be out of gas 
by Christmas. Lucky for them, 
there’s still nearly a month 
left before Big Ten play starts 
and Michigan should breeze 
through teams like North 
Florida, Fort Wayne and 
Delaware State.

Barnes Arico has to use that 

time to figure out an eighth 
spot in the rotation and balance 
out the minutes distribution 
a little more. If she doesn’t, 
it will come back to bite the 
Wolverines.

Season in Review: Wide receivers

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2017 regular season in 
the books, the Daily looks back 
at the performance of each unit 
this year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2018. In this edition: 
wide receivers.

This season, the Wolverines 

had to absorb the loss of their 
two leading receivers from 
2016 — Amara Darboh and 
Jehu Chesson.

Quite 
simply, 
their 

departures showed.

The duo of fifth-year seniors 

combined for 1,362 yards and 
nine touchdowns to finish off 
their Michigan careers. This 
year, the Wolverines had five 
main receiving targets — junior 
Grant Perry, sophomores Kekoa 
Crawford and Eddie McDoom 
and 
freshmen 
Donovan 

Peoples-Jones and Tarik Black 
(the latter of whom fell victim 
to injury in September) — 
but managed just 938 yards 
and 
three 
touchdowns 
in 

comparison.

Perry, the veteran of the 

group, led the way with 25 
catches for 307 yards and a 
touchdown, but even as the 
primary option, he faced a drop 
in production from a season 
ago. As the third receiver in 
2016, he collected 183 yards and 
a touchdown on just 13 targets.

Crawford had a bright start 

to the season, hauling in a 
career-high four receptions for 
a career-best 83 yards with one 
touchdown against Cincinnati. 
But an increased role in the 
passing game didn’t last long 
for the sophomore, who didn’t 
catch more than two passes in 
a game for the rest of the year. 
His 
counterpart, 
McDoom, 

faced his own struggles in his 
second season, garnering just 
81 yards all year.

Peoples-Jones, though he 

didn’t begin the season as a 

starter, turned into Michigan’s 
second-best receiver in his first 
year as a Wolverine, catching 16 
passes for 219 yards. While he 
didn’t reach the end zone as a 
receiver, he did have a 79-yard 
punt return touchdown against 
Air Force. His classmate, Black, 
opened the year as a starter and 
looked poised to have a stellar 
campaign before a foot injury 
against Air Force derailed his 
season.

To 
be 
fair, 
Michigan’s 

receiving unit had to deal with 
a carousel of quarterbacks 
throughout the year. Redshirt 
junior Wilton Speight, redshirt 
freshman Brandon Peters and 
fifth-year senior John O’Korn 
all spent time under center 
for 
the 
Wolverines 
during 

various points of the season, 
which could have factored 
significantly 
in 
Michigan’s 

struggles through the air in 
2017.

HIGH POINT: In a season 

with 
few 
options 
in 
this 

category, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

second 
game 
of 
the 
year 

against Cincinnati sticks out as 
the best performance from the 
unit.

All 
three 
of 
Michigan’s 

starting wideouts — Perry, 
Crawford and Black — caught 
four 
passes 
on 
the 
day, 

amassing a total of 160 yards.

Crawford and Perry also 

each found the end zone with 
43- and 33-yard touchdowns, 
respectively — the only time 
that multiple receivers scored 
in the same game all year.

Granted, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

passing game did have a few 
other strong outings, but much 
of the credit for that belongs to 
tight ends Sean McKeon and 
Zach Gentry.

The pair combined for 561 

yards and five touchdowns 
this year, and they connected 
especially well with Peters 
during his stint at the helm of 
Michigan’s offense.

LOW POINT: If his stellar 

start hadn’t reached an abrupt 
conclusion, Black might be in 
the above category. But just 
three weeks into his freshman 
season, the 6-foot-3 wideout 
had to be carted off the field 
late in the fourth quarter. He 
wouldn’t return for the rest of 
the year.

The day after the game, 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said that Black would need 
to undergo surgery to repair 
a crack on the outside of his 
foot. Though no announcement 
has yet to be made, Harbaugh 
said in mid-November that he 
will explore the possibility of 
pursuing a medical redshirt 
for Black, which would allow 
him to preserve four years of 
eligibility.

Through three weeks, Black 

was the Wolverines’ leading 
receiver with 11 catches for 149 
yards and a touchdown.

Michigan 
certainly 
could 

have 
used 
his 
dynamic 

presence to breathe life into its 
passing offense in 2017.

THE 
FUTURE: 
The 

Wolverines won’t be losing 
anyone this time around.

All five receivers will be back 

to man the rotation next year, 
assuming Black’s recovery is 
smooth and he remains healthy 
over the course of the fall.

While seniors Drake Harris 

and Maurice Ways announced 
this week that they will pursue 
graduate transfers elsewhere, 
neither receiver made an impact 
on the field for Michigan. The 
most notable transfer news 
came from Speight, whose 
departure 
should 
stabilize 

the relationship between the 
Wolverines’ 
throwers 
and 

catchers next season.

With a full offseason as the 

presumed starter, Peters and 
his receivers will have plenty of 
time to develop their chemistry 
in order to turn the passing 
game around in 2018.
