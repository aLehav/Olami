GOLDEN APPLE WINNER: VICTOR LIEBERMAN

After 30 years at
U',noted instructor
reflects on career
and research
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
Teaching was not History
Prof. Victor Lieberman's first
career choice. Lieberman, who
has taught at the University
since 1984, originally believed
his future would be comprised
of research and "solving histori-
cal and intellectual problems."
And though his research
chops aren't in question -
in fact, he has been granted
countless awards and fellow-
ships and has written dozens
of articles and book chapters on
various research interests, with
research taking up the "bulk" of
his time in Ann Arbor - it is as
a teacher that Lieberman truly
shines; at least according to his.
students.
Lieberman is the recipient of
this year's Golden Apple Award,

an annual award that recogniz-
es excellence in teaching and is
determined by University stu-
dents.
Granted by University of
Michigan Hillel, the award hon-
ors faculty who "consistently
teach each lecture as if it were
their last, and strive not only to
disseminate knowledge but to
inspire and engage students in
its pursuit."
While he didn't necessar-
ily bleed maize and blue before
coming to the University - he
said he came to Ann Arbor
because the University offered
the only job available in his field
- Lieberman said the emotional
bonds he has created with stu-
dents changed his perspective
on teaching.
"Once I started teaching I
found it was a lot of fun," he
said. "I like interacting with
students; I like to see their
enthusiasm and to kind of
inspire them." .

ates very bright, enthusiastic
and eager to learn, and work-

New study

Scientists discover new
neural interactions that

By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
Tired? Going to sleep is more
important than you may think.
Many people may have heard of
circadian rhythms - they're the rea-
son for your 4 p.m. exhaustion or your
jetlag after returning from spring
break in Paris. In simple terms, these
rhythms tell your body when to sleep
and when to wake up.
The rhythms usually work in
24-hour periods and are run by cells
known as 'clock neurons.' In a recent
study, University researchers dis-
covered that these clock neurons are
much more complex than they previ-
ously thought.
In the past, scientists believed a
small group of neurons controlled
the thousands of clock neurons in
the humanbrain. OrieShafer, assis-
tant professor of molecular, cellular

Starting at 5 p.m. Monday
evening, students began to line
up outside the Michigan Union
to secure their spot for tickets

for President Barack Obama's
Wednesday address on campus,
forming a line of nearly 1,000
that traveled from the Union's
side entrance to the Kelsey
Archaeology museum.
At 10:30 that morning Tues-
day morning, an hour and a
half after tickets started being
distributed, the ticket office
announced it was out of tickets
and shut down, turning away
SO to 60 students who were
still in line. Obama will make
his third visit to campus during

his presidency to discuss his
proposal to raise federal mini-
mum wage from $7.25 to $10.10

Princeton discusses meningitis

Mibs Mara, associate
director for reunions at
Princeton University, told The
Daily Princetonian that the
Princeton Alumni Association
is planning a "key meeting" to
discuss whether alumni should
be able to stay overnight on the
university's campus in light of
a recent uptick in meningitis
cases across the region.
After the recent death of a
Drexel University student from
meningitis, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and the New Jersey
Department of Health advised
Princeton to increase hygienic
practices to prevent an outbreak
at the university, including vac-
cination clinics hosted by the
university in December, Febru-

ary and March. An investigation
performed by the CDC revealed
the Drexel student acquired
meningitis through a Princeton
student who carried the disease
but did not show symptoms.
According to the Daily Princ-
etonian, the university recently
announced it would cancel the
traditional alumni overnight
stays during their reunion
weekend for the "health safety
of newly admitted students."
Rabbi and reverend engage in
interfaith dialogue at Duke
University
Reverend Luke Powery, dean
of Duke Chapel, and Rabbi Raa-
chel Jurovics came together on

Monday to discuss how past
tragedies in the African-Amer-
ican and Jewish communities
influence modern-day culture,
the Duke Chronicle reported.
WUNC Radio's Frank Stasio
moderated the discussion as the
two reflected on slavery and the
Holocaust, focusing on both the
tragedies' evils and what society
can learn from them. The two
agreed that to truly progress
as a civilization, people must
discuss not only its triumphs but
also its devastation.
"The catastrophes that are
most difficult to understand are
those like slavery and the Holo-
caust that are experienced by
one group of people and gener-
ated by another," Stasio said.

CSG
From Page1A
the University Elections Com-
mission delayed the release of
results, but each case was either
resolved or dropped by Tues-
day afternoon. The rulings had
negligible impact on the official
results of the election.
The complaint with the great-
est potential consequence was
dropped on Monday when Make
Michigan officially withdrew its
suit against FORUM for alleged
abuse of e-mail privileges.
Make Michigan filed the
complaint against its rival party
after LSA junior Domenic Riz-
zolo, outreach co-director for
FORUM, sent a campaigning
e-mail using a listerv he did
not own. If the UEC had ruled
FORUM guilty, the party would
have faced demerits for each
recipient of the e-mail in ques-
tion. The total accumulation of
demerits would have exceeded
limits outlined in the election
code and resulted in the disqual-
ification of each FORUM candi-
date.
After further reviewing the
case, Dishell concluded that Riz-
zolo's e-mail would have had
marginal impact on the election
itself and decided to withdraw
his suit. In a statement sent out
to all candidates announcing
the withdrawal, Dishell said
he wanted to avoid the hostile
environment and unproductive
intra-CSG rivalries created by
a lengthy litigation process. He

added that he filed the official
complaint initially to uphold the
provisions of the election code.
"You can always withdraw,
just like we did," Dishell said.
"But I can't, after the fact, go
back and say, I really wish we
had filed this."
The official complaints
regarding alleged campaign
finance infractions by FORUM,
the Party Party and the House
of Cards Party were upheld
and addressed in a UEC hear-
ing Monday evening. Business
senior Matthew Fernandez, rep-
manager for Make Michigan,
filed the complaint on behalf of
Make Michigan, citing failure
to publish receipts on campaign
finance forms as a major infrac-
tion.
Dishell said these cases, in
contrast to the alleged e-mail
misuse, could have had an impact
on voting. He said possible over-
spending could have created an
unfair advantage.
In an official ruling released
Tuesday, the UEC found all three
parties guilty of the infraction,
but reduced the punishment
outlined in the election code.
While a major infraction usually
calls for three to four demerits
per violation, the UEC instead
assigned two demerits per party.
The UEC cited miscommuni-
cation between candidates and
the election director as well as
vagueness of the wording of the
election code as grounds for
reducing the number of demerits
assigned for the violation.
In the ruling, the UEC said

campaign finance forms pro-
vided to candidates did not
explicitly contain instructions
for receipts that were called for
in the code. Additionally, once
respondents were made aware of
the violation, they provided the
appropriate receipts.
These demerits did not affect
the outcome of the election in
any way. Parties are penalized
for demerits until they reach
10, at which point that party
is removed from the election
entirely.
Law student Bryson Nitta,
election director, released a dis-
senting opinion along with the
UEC's official ruling. Nitta acts
as an ex officio member of the
UEC and does notvote on official
rulings.
Nitta expressed discontent
with the demerits assigned to
FORUM, the Party Party and the
House of Cards Party.
"Candidates and students are
not law enforcement officers
trained in detecting deceit and
fraud," Nitta wrote.
Manes and Abraham hugged
fellow FORUM candidates after
receiving the news that they did
not win. Manes said their work
will not stop despite the elec-
tion's outcome.
"We wholeheartedly believe
that titles don't really give you
any extra power," Manes said.
"If students believe in doing
things, they can get things
done just by their own moti-
vation and their own personal
drive and passion because they
care about things."

Naidu said. "We were so excited
when we got into the building."
It was unclear exactly how
many students received tickets.
Michigan Union Director Susan
Pile said for security reasons, the
White House was not releasing
information regarding the exact
number of tickets to the event.
However, she said everyone
who camped out overnight and
received a voucher in line in the
early hours of the morning was
able to geta ticket, as well as some
students who showed up later in
the morning after vouchers were
done being passed out.
LSA freshman Stuart Ina-
huazo, who had camped out since
2 a.m. early Tuesday morning,
said after receiving his ticket, the
long wait was worth it.
"After all the rain and cold, it
feels great," Inahuazo said.

rewarding," he added later in a
follow-up e-mail. "They're appre-
ciative and intellectually engaged,
and their enthusiasm redoubles
my own."
For the past 29 years, Lieber-
man has risen through the ranks
in the history department and the
Center for Southeast Asian Stud-
ies. He is currently the Raoul Wal-
lenberg Distinguished University
Professor of History, one of the
University's top honors for profes-
sors in the field, and teaches one
of the University's largest courses
each semester, which focuses on
the history of the Arab-Israeli
Conflict.
Out of more than 300 nominees
- the most in the award's 24-year
history - Lieberman stood out to
the Golden Apple Award Com-
mittee not only because of the
number of votes he received, but
because the comments accom-
panying the votes "highlighted
the characteristics of a profes-
sor truly deserving of the Golden
Apple Award," said LSA senior
Amalia Zimmerman, a member of
the committee.
"Victor Liebermanhas inspired
many students to look at the his-
tory of different peoples and cul-
tures," added Business senior
Jake Levey, another member of
the committee, in a statement.
"All of them are enamored by his
amazing breadth of knowledge
and his passion."
"It was a very memorable and
happy occasion," Lieberman said
of the committee's announcement
of the award in March. "I was
very grateful to receive it."
In class, Lieberman speaks
quickly, filling the entirety of
the time allotted with fact after
historical fact. His lectures are
authoritative and students dili-
gently recordevery word.
It is this perceived unbiased
presentation of historical facts
that students admire the most,
said LSA sophomore Ali Meisel,
who took Lieberman's course last
year.

Meisel said she was able to
form her own opinion of the
controversial subject matter in
a well-informed way because
of Lieberman's approach to the
class. This teaching style led her
to nominate him for the Golden
Apple this year.
"Lieberman made a point of
telling us that although he was
teaching us facts, the 'truth' of
the situation differed for different
groups," Meisel said. "Some pro-
fessors are particularly liberal or

ahna Anders, who came at 7:30
a.m., said they were unsure they
were goingto get tickets, but were
excited they did.
"It's just nice to see a current
president," Anders said. "It's a
cool event."
Pile, whose staff ran the ticket-
ing process, said she thought the
process went very well.
"The students were awesome,"
Pile said. "I think they were excit-
ed, they were energized about
being there, and I think overall
very appreciative of the opportu-
nity to get a chance to hear Presi-
dent Obama."
LSA senior Anne Krema, who
started camping out at 11:30 p.m.
Monday night, said she thought
that the line was fairly calm and
orderly throughout the night and
morning.
"There was kind of an under-
standing among the people in the
line - some people tried to cut
when the line was moving slow,
but everyone yelled at them,"
Krema said. "We've all been in
here all night, so people for the
conservative, and this affects how
they present the material in their
classes, but Lieberman chose to
leave out his personal opinions."
That's not to say the profes-
sor isn't without controversy. On
March 25, he presented a histori-
cal context of the Israeli-Palestin-
ian conflict at a Central Student
Government meeting during a
debate regarding a resolution that
supports the University's divest-
ment from certain companies that
allegedly support human rights
abuses in the region.
Many supporters of Students
Allied for Freedom and Equality,
a Palestinian human rights stu-
dent organization, contended that
Lieberman did not present both
sides of the conflict adequately,
adding that they asked him not
to speak at the meeting because
it was supposed to represent stu-
dents' and not faculty concerns.
Still, Meisel said she nominat-
ed Lieberman precisely because
he accounts for both sides of the
story in the ongoing conflict.
"Lieberman eloquently cov-
ered a major world conflict with-
in a single semester," she said.
"Instead of teaching the events as
neutral facts, he explained .them
from both the Palestinian and
Israeli narratives."
As part of the award, Lieber-
man will give his "last lecture"
Wednesday in Rackham Audito-
rium. The lecture, titled "What I
think I know About History," will
give an overview of human his-
tory as Lieberman has come to
view it.
"It's very broad," he said. "I
won't be accused of lack of ambi-
tion."
University President Mary Sue
Coleman will also address the
attendants at the event Wednes-
day.
"This is such a wonderful trib-
ute and I want to thank our stu-
dents for the honor," Coleman
said in a statement to the award
committee. "The Golden Apple
symbolizes the importance we
place on undergraduate teaching
at Michigan, and to be associated
with the program this way means
a great deal to me."

Lieberman's history
Lieberman, a self-described
"history buff," said he became
interested in history from a young
age and took classes on "every
part of the world" in college. But
as the Vietnam War escalated
and the United States became
more embroiled in the ongoing
conflict during his time in col-
lege, he focused his attention and
research on Southeast Asia.

most part areinan understanding
about that."
Monday night, Engineer-
ing senior Anshul Mehta cited
an unofficial numbering system
started by students that he said
worked well, though he added
that he wished University staff
had created an official line or
numbering system.
"Right now it's just a bunch of
kids trying to get order, and that
doesn't always work at four in the
morning," Mehta said. "That said,
this numbering system is work-
ing."
While the Obama's remarks
will begin at 2:30 p.m., doors
will open at 12:30 p.m. Univer-
sity spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald
said the University is confident
that everyone who received a
ticket will be able to get a spot,
despite some initial student con-
cern about a clause on the tick-
ets saying they do not guarantee
admission.
"Honestly, I just want to get a
selfie with the president in the
background," Mehta said.
After graduating first in his
class from Yale University in 1967,
Lieberman took a three-year hia-
tus to teach high school history -
and avoid serving in the Vietnam
War - before he earned a Ph.D. in
Southeast Asian history from the
University of London's School of
Oriental and African Studies in
1976.
"I found it topical, I found it
exciting," he said of his research
interests. "I thought I could say
something relatively novel."
He stayed in England until
1985, when he came to the Uni-
versity as an assistant professor
in Southeast Asian history and
taught a class about the Vietnam
War. In the mid-90s, as interest in
the war waned, Lieberman knew
he needed to change topics in
order to keep up with the interests
of his students.
He then began teaching the
course he is perhaps best known
for at the University, "History 244:
The History of the Arab-Israeli
Conflict." With lectures involv-
ing more than 400 students each
semester, the class is one of the
largest the University has to offer.
"I became addicted to the idea
of large, topical courses," he said.
"I looked around to see what
would be appropriate to replace
the Vietnam War course and I
thought the Mideast would fit that
description ... I thought it would
be useful for students, to provide
them with an overview and to
increase understanding and sym-
pathy for different perspectives."
In addition to his responsibili-
ties at the University, Lieberman
is the father of two daughters,
Jessica, 33, and Emily, 38 - both
of whom graduated from the Uni-
versity - and has six grandchil-
dren. He also has two "lovely"
sons-in-law, one of whom took his
class about the Vietnam War dur-
ing his undergraduate years at the
University and met his daughter
while enrolled in the Law School.
His wife of 43 years, Sharon,
passed away a few months ago.
In his spare time, the history
buff says he likes to spend time
with his grandchildren - who
live in Ann Arbor and nearby

Birmingham - as well as attend
Synagogue and exercise.
He also plans to travel more in
the coming years and is working
on a forthcoming book "Why Was
Nationalism European? Political
Ethnicity in Southeast Asia and
Europe, c. 1400-1850," which he
says will occupy him intellectual-
ly for the next two to three years.
"I don't know what I'll do after,
maybe I'll start anotherbook proj-
ect," he mused. "I don't know. I'll
just have to wait and see."

on-campus programs at more than
100 locations across the country.
The university was founded
in 1976 with the aim of serv-
ing working adults who desire
a degree in higher education
offered through flexible and
nearby classes. Today, the Uni-
versity of Phoenix is the largest
for-profit institution of higher
education in the country.
Slottow will fill the role
recentlyvacated by Bill Pepicello,
outgoing University of Phoenix
president, who has served in the
position since 1995.
In a press release, Marrilee
Lewis Engel, chair of the Univer-
sity of Phoenix board of trustees,
said Slottow's experience at the
University makes him an ideal
candidate for the position.
"Tim Slottow's leadership at
the University of Michigan ampli-
fies what he has done throughout
his accomplished career: deliver-
ing measurable results to public
and private organizations as they
embrace the principle of continu-
ous advancement and transition to
reach ambitious goals," Engel said.
Greg Cappelli, a member of
the University of Phoenix board
of trustees and the chief execu-
tive officer of Apollo Education
Group, the university's parent
company, discussed Slottow's
qualifications in an e-mail sent to
employees Tuesday.

evidence showing that different
groups of clock neurons actually
play their own parts in keeping
time for the body.
"We used to think there was
one small set of neurons that were
the conductors," Shafer said.
"Our work suggests that it's more
of a committee decision. There
are several important groups of
time neurons that interact with
each other to produce a sense of
time."
The researchers studied fruit
flies, organisms with circadi-
an rhythms similar to those of
humans. Rackham student Zepeng
Yao said many of the 150 clock
neurons in fruit flies responded to
environmental cues rather than
cues from "conductor" neurons.
"Some of them might respond
to light information ... some of

dents to advance in their lives
- and in their careers - through
high-quality, accessible, higher
education programs," he wrote.
"He is determined to make edu-
cation work for working stu-
dents, and we're so incredibly
pleased that he chose us to fur-
ther his efforts."
Traditionally, the position of
University provost has been the
stepping-stone to the presidency
of another university. Former
University provosts Phil Hanlon
and Teresa Sullivan were selected
to lead other institutions - Dart-
mouth University and the Uni-
versity of Virginia, respectively
- during their tenures as provost.
In a letter to colleagues in
the University's Office of Busi-
ness and Finance, Slottow said
the country's future relies not
only on institutions like the Uni-
versity, but also on those more
focused on meeting the needs
of non-traditional, mid-career
adult students. With the Univer-
sity of Phoenix's online program,
a college education is available to
a larger number of students and
professionals.
"As you know, I am passion-
ate about higher education and
believe deeply in the important
role the University of Michigan
plays in preparing future leaders
and helping to solve many of our
most vexing societal challenges,"
he wrote. "We know, too, that
our country's competitiveness
will rely on the full spectrum of
higher education opportunities
to educate our workforce so it
can meet its potential and fuel
U.S. economic development."
The departure also poses an
them might be more sensitive to
temperature changes," Yao said.
"These cues will either advance
or delay the clock neurons."
Clock neurons are highly sensi-
tive in response to environmental
factors, Shafer said. The clock can
be prompted to reset by receiv-
ing a waking cue at a time when
it wants to sleep. For example, in
the modern world, the constant
input of light when clock neurons
want darkness can keep one's
body awake. In the same way, eat-
ing late at night can also reset the
clock.
"In this very complicated mod-
ern world, we get all the natural
cues - for example, the sun com-
ing up and going down every day,"
Shafer said. "People who stay up
late, they're getting conflicting
information about what time itis."

additional challenge for Uni-
versity President-elect Mark
Schlissel, who will need to fill
multiple interim positions at the
beginning of his term. S. Jack Hu
is currently serving as the inter-
im vice president for research,
and Michael Johns will fill in as
interim CEO of the University of
Michigan Health System follow-
ing Pescovitz's departure.
Duringhis 12 years inthe posi-
tion, Slottow led the University
through a number of cost-saving
initiatives designed to keep bud-
gets in check during a period of
declining state funding.
Slottow piloted programs such
as strategic sourcing - procure-
ment measures designed to save
money by buying equipment and
supplies in bulk across multiple
Universityunits - and the Admin-
istrative Services Transformation
Project- an initiative thatwilleen-
tralize department-level employ-
ees in a shared services center.
"Collectively we have met the
largest and smallest challenges
- posed by our external environ-
ment and rapidly changing cam-
pus needs - with innovative new
ways of doing business," Slottow
said in his statement.
In October, Slottow
announced the University's
endowment reached an all-time
high of $8.4 billion over the fiscal
year. The endowment is now the
second-largest of any public uni-
versity, according to the National
Association of College and Uni-
versity Business Officers and the
Commonfund.
During Slottow's time at the
University, the endowment has
increased from $3.5 billion in
2003 to $8.4 billion.
displaying how complex clock
neurons are, one should be wary
ignoring them.
"Not being able to follow your
own body clock is really bad for
you," Shafer said. "You shouldn't
continually ignore what time it is
in your brain... These are intricate,
highly evolved timepieces that are
there for a reason."
Although circadian rhythms
are far from completely under-
stood, Yao said this discovery
could lead to new insights. In the
long run, it could lead to a method
of targeting specific neurons to
reduce negative effects of deviat-
ing from the rhythms.
"We hope with our research
we can pinpoint which neurons
are responsible for which kinds
of behavior," Yao said. "We want
to see whether we can change
the properties with drugs or
other processes to alleviate
sleeping disorders and other
syndromes."

The trivial antics during CSG elections are detrimental to students
L ast Thursday marked the closing of the Central Student Government
elections, yet the results weren't announced until Tuesday night. On
March 24, CSG parties FORUM and Make Michigan filed numerous
complaints against a number of parties. Though the the University Elections
Commission found defendants not guilty in the original complaints, four new
complaints were filed by Make Michigan over the weekend against FORUM,
the Party Party and the House of Cards Party. For the last two years, CSG has
shown that it's unable to conduct itself in a mature manner that puts student
voices above petty politics. Since CSG is obviously not capable of monitoring

Of all the perks of working in downtown
Detroit, the restaurants the city has to offer
duringlunch breaks might be the best of them.
So as I did every Friday, I left my office for a
lunch break to enjoy some of Detroit's finest. I
was in the mood for a good burger, so Mercury
Burger Bar in Corktown was the destination.
The drive along Michigan Avenue in
Corktown may be the worst in the city. It's
useless to try to avoid the potholes - you just
drive through them hoping for thebest. The road
is made of bricks, remnants from when trolley
cars used to take patrons from Michigan Central
Station to downtown with a single lane of patchy
pavement in the middle to cover the old tracks,
unused for more than 60 years now. Sometimes a
bit of the metal tracks canbe seen peeking out of
that poorly paved asphalt, fragments of a past far
brighter than theblight that has faced the center
of Corktown since the closing of Tiger Stadium.
I'd driven past the blank field of the former
stadium site on the corner of Michigan and
Trumbull many times since the old ballpark
had closed. Some of my first memories were
formed in that stadium, a cathedral to the
golden age of baseball. I would go with my dad,
take a seat underneath the overhanging upper
deck and take in as much of the field that wasn't
blocked by the support beams scattered among
the seats. The Tigers were never winners
during those years. Not once did they even post
a winning season during my lifetime of games
at the stadium,but not once did it matter to me.
Today, for whatever reason, I decided to
pull up next to the iron gates - the sole rem-
nant of the exterior of the stadium. Gone are
the large white facades and the large, white-
painted light structures. In right field, where
that famous overhang of the upper deck once
stood, is just patchy grass. Where I once sat as
an eager kindergarten-aged child - baseball
glove on my left hand waiting for the souvenir
that never came - was nothing.
It was a perfect summer day for the baseball
game this field would never see again. I walked
inside the gates to the infield dirt, which
remains from the original playing field and is
kept up by volunteers alone. The Navin Field
Grounds Crew, as they call themselves, pays
homage to the original name of the field that
opened the same day as Fenway Park in Boston.
How different have the two historic icons
been treated.
In the middle of the barren block, 200 feet

in the air stands the flagpole that once rested
inside the left-center field fence as an obstacle
in the outfield. The same flag that 53,000 fans
stood to face with their hats off before each
game now stands alone. Comerica Park once
had its own flagpole placed in the field of play
as an homage from the new to the old.
I turned to resume my lunch plans but real-
ized I wasn't alone. Another college-aged man
- perhaps another intern working downtown
- and his dad walked through the gates tak-
ing in the same empty field. The dad wore an
orange-billed Tigers cap, the old logo with the
rough tiger face emblazoned on the front. The
Tigers haven't used that logo in 20 years.
The original Mercury Bar in Corktown
closed in the 1980s. What once was the
popular spot for train travelers at Michigan
Central Station since before World War II
became abandoned just like the station itself.
A few years ago, two new owners found the
bar's original sign, flipped on the neon sign
and proceeded to open the best burger joint
downtown. The restaurant still stands in the
shadow of the decrepit station, as the splendid
decay appears synonymous with the city. Even
as time passes, the past remains in plain sight.
It's been almost five years since the
demolition of the sacred stadium, The Corner.
It too once loomed for 10 years and was decrepit
and decayinglike thetrain station. Thebases Ty
Cobb stole, the dugout where manager Sparky
Anderson yelled, "You don't want to walk him!"
to Padres pitcher Goose Gossage before Kirk
Gibson homered in the 1984 World Series, the
field Charlie "The Mechanical Man" Gehringer
patrolled and the fences that Hammerin' Hank
Greenberg slugged baseballs over, the football
grass where Lions player Chuck Hughes
suffered a heart attack during a football game
and passed away. None of it remains.
But even though the stadium is gone,
reduced to ablank slate of infield dirt and grass,
something is still there. Something far grander
than the grandiosity of the stadium ever was. It
can be covered up like the pavement covers the
trolley tracks. It can be pushed aside. But it can
neverbe taken away.
As I exited through the gates, the dad and his
son broke out their baseball gloves and started
to play catch. They say baseball is America's
pastime. And the pastime never dies.

the second time in my three years
on campus.
I was fairly uncertain about
whether I wanted to wait in line
tonight, as I saw Obama last time he
came to campus and I wasn't sure if I
was mentally prepared to wait in line
for 10-12 hours. It would be warmer
this time versus the last, but a big
commitment nonetheless. Obviously,
I decided to come out, mostly
because I knew that I would have the
company of many friends who had
decided to camp out. As I sit here in
line, I am thankful for the fact that
I attend a school that provides me
with such wonderful opportunities,
like the ability to see the current
President not once, but twice during
my college career.
However, I consider many other
things as I wait here in line. One is
that, a few hours ago, a friend came
around asking for signatures for a
petition to raise the minimum wage
here in Michigan. Interestingly
enough, people were fairly hesitant
to sign, even though technically
that is the reason we are all here.
Also, the fact that when the topic
of Obama's speech was announced,
many were surprised due to the
CORINE ROSENBERG
"The only way to deal with an
unfree world is to become so absolutely
free that your very existence is an act
of rebellion." -Aert Camus
I spent all of last year on campus
practicing something I called 'silent
love.' Walking around from class to
class, through the Diag or around
the Union, I would yell, in my head,
my love for the people around me.
"I love you, beautiful girl in the red
coat and red pants, you are as big as
your heart will let you be, you are
lovely. I love you too, sweet hipster
boy with pants rolled up and head
hung down, lift your head up for you
arebrilliant. I love you, boy with your
head in a book of comics, and you,
lovely professor or staff, fearless in
brightly colored clothing. I love you
too, man who sits every day to share
your music with the UGLi and its sad
neighbors." I would speak in my head
to every person I passed, give them
compliments, tell them I loved them,
would yell it atnthem so fierce.
Sometimes I fear we have lost
our ability to love, to say thank you,
"you'rebeautiful,"orholdastranger's
hand on abus ride fromBursley-Baits
to C.C. Little. We put up walls, judge
on appearances and decide we don't
like people without knowing them,
simply because of how they look or
act. We do not know everyone's story,
everyone's reality. We do not know
why someone may be sad or glowing
or angry. We no longer know how to
ask the big questions or say the big
things. Instead, we fill our days with
small talk.
I have often been judged,
sometimes accurately and
sometimes completely inaccurately.
I am a person who has been disliked
as much as I have been loved, who
has found herselfbullied all through
elementary and middle and high
school, who stuffed her bra to try to
fit in and cut her wrists to try to cry
out. I am not here to prove myself as
a person to you. I am just here to ask
you to listen.

Silent love
to the people whose photos he took
- would ask them powerful ques-
tions and receive even more power-
ful responses. He paired these quotes
with the photos and gave a heautiful
and raw humanity to these strangers.
I started following his blog, and
as it took off, so did many similar to
his: Humans of Boston, Humans of
Detroit and Humans of Los Angeles.
I began to think of a few things as I
saw this evolution. First, how little
or much we show through our face,
carry in our body language and
tell in our voice. How many stories
those around us carry but do not
share. Second, how much small talk
we have, speaking about weather or
current events but so rarely ourselves
or our feelings. How reserved we are
with those we love but how open we
can be with strangers. Lastly, the girl
with her feet hanging off the bridge
might need you to smile at her, pull
her away or maybe even simply join
her for a bit. Sit in silence. Appreciate
the new view.
As my campus has turned into a
place of conflict, anger, frustration,
fear - a place where people do not
feel safe, listened to, or supported -
I have wondered what the answer
may be. Is taking away the humanity
from those we do not know a new
phenomenon? Or rather have we
spent too much time learning how
to build walls to know how to break
them down? I hear everyone saying
they want peace, but the ways in
which they want it are not the same.
We have shut our ears to the other
side. We have tuned out.
Let me share something personal
in the hopes that you will listen. I
am angry. I am just as angry as you,
or perhaps less, or even more. I am
frustrated. I am privileged. I am
oppressed. These are not mutually
exclusive. I am white; I am female; I
am pansexual; I am young; I am mid-
dle class. I have decided to live every
day as an act of rebellion against the
oppressive institutions, systems and
cultural norms that perpetrate these
inequalities. I will not marry until
everyone, regardless of gender, can
marry in the eyes of the law. I will not
support a system that is oppressive.
I am angry. I want to wear the
clothes that I want to. I want to

dance if I want to, sing if I want to,
not explain myself because you say
that I have to. I have been sexually
assaulted. I have notshared this with
anyone other than family, closest
of friends, therapists or hospital
doctors. This is a story I wear every
day in my voice and my body, on my
face, but hide. I am not alone. We
are all carrying our baggage, some
tucked into breast pockets, some
spilling over onto that 2 a.m. busback
to North Campus. I am not asking
you to pity me, to say you are sorry. In
fact, I am still not ready to talk about
these things. I am just asking that
you respect the stories that surround
you every day.
I am pretending you are Brandon
Stanton on a train in New York City,
and you are asking me about the time
I was the most scared. I am telling
him, "I am scared every day. I am
scared that someone will hurt me.
That someone is hurting someone
else. I am scared that we are not lis-
tening to each other. Iam scared that
there is nothing Ican do tofix it."
As my campus has turned into a
volatile and emotional place, a place
where some feel scared to share
their beliefs, and others feel like
there is nothing they can do to fix it,
I see something else. I see passion. I
see walls being broken down. I see
people coming together in ways they
did not think that they could.
I am just asking that we do one
more thing. That we start being
more mindful, stop judging others,
start asking strangers questions,
stop all the small talk, start saying
the big things even if they hurt. I am
asking that we realize that those who
are privileged did not ask for that
privilege, that they must recognize
it and fight against it in the very
act of their existence to the best of
their abilities. I am asking that we
remember that each person on that
bus or sitting in the Diag enjoying
45-degree weather has a story,
unspoken but real. I am asking that
we all start practicing love. Not only
self-love and friend love, but silent
love. Let us give our peers back their
humanity. Let us try to listen.

forth through time. We see the (or as disappointing) as this finale

was, it was never the point: it was
the MacGuffin. This was never a
series about the mother, but about
everything leading up to her. It's
about Ted measuring his own self-
worth ashe becomes less confident
as he ages, about the trials of stay-
ing together as a long-time couple
exemplified by Lily and Marshall,
about Robin needing to weigh her
romantic life with her work life
and about Barney, well, being Bar-
ney mostly. It's about losing out
to guys named Sven, about crazy
eyed-dates, lower back tattoos and
other poor decisions made after 2
a.m., interventions, doppelgangers
and Canadianrpop star alter egos.
And it's about the unpredict-
ability of life in your twenties, the
loss of loved ones, the fear of grow-
ing apart as friends and family.
But it's also about the comfort in
knowing that, despite inevitable
separations, those relationships
are always the most meaning-
ful because, in the end, we find
ourselves through them and the
stories we share. The finale tried
to deliver a little bit of all of those
emotions, and, for that, it should be
commended.
"Do you have any idea what hap-
pened right here, in this very bar?"
Marshall asks three unassuming
patrons at MacLaren's, only to
answer his own question, "just...
all kinds of stuff." We should only
be so lucky to answer in such a
way. Sometimes we lose our way
or lose sight of what's most impor-
tant to us; sometimes we're lucky
enough to rediscover all that stuff
or find something new. But we'll
always have our stories, to remind
us of who we are and where we're
going - that's what "How I Met
Your Mother" taught us.
Bircoll out.

he storefront of 1249
Woodward Avenue
looks like a comput-
er's motherboard, with wires
and connections painted across
its windows
in bright-
orange. In the
middle is the
company's
portmanteau
name, "Kid-
preneur" - a
place dedicat-
ed to teaching PAIGE
tweens com- PFLEGER
puter skills
that give rise
to young entrepreneurs with way
loftier goals of creation than just a
lemonade stand.
It's hard to imagine a genera-
tion of kids that instead of playing
video games are designing their
own, or instead of watching ani-
mated movies are creating them,
but Kidpreneur takes tweens from
ages nine to 13 and molds them into
tech-savvy students who grow to
love computers, architecture and
engineering. The company's cre-
ator, ThanhTran, hopes that peak-
ing these kids' interest before they
turn into moody teens will show
them that tech and entrepreneur-
ship can be "cool."
And its new pop-up location on
Woodward Avenue helps add to
that cool vibe.
"The kids in the Detroit area
don't have the opportunity to
have something like this," Tran
said. "Because we have a space
downtown we see that there is
an interest here - as a matter of
fact, there's a need here for some-
thing like this. I think we have a

lot of traction, and with more time
I think we can make a positive
impact."
Tran won the Woodward Ave.
store front in the D:hive Pilot
program, which is dedicated to
bringing start-ups to Detroit. Kid-
preneur's victory means that the
originally Northville-based com-
pany receives the space for free
for two months. After those two
months are over, Tran hopes to
maintain a strong presence down-
town by finding a partner who
might be willing to share a space
when Kidpreneur's time with
D:hive is up.
According to Tran, there aren't
nearly enough kid-and family-
friendly opportunities down-
town, aside from the occasional
seasonal-based festivals or staple
activities that the city has always
had. By taking classes in the city,
the kids get exposure to Detroit
in a controlled environment, and
parents become more comfortable
with the area by exploring while
their kids are in class.
For Donna Miller, from Grosse
Pointe, taking her kids to classes in
Detroit's Kidpreneur location was
a "no-brainer." She even encour-
aged her son's friends to take class-
es too, and she shuttles the little
motley crew back and forth for
their workshops. They frequent
the restaurants around Kidpre-
neur, like local Slices Pizza, or the
new Olga's. They visited the Win-
terfest downtown, the DIA and the
public library.
"I never envisioned myself com-
ing downtown and taking my kids
down as much as we have," Miller
said. "My opinion of the city has
changed. It's not as scary as I had

initially thought."
Tran hopes that by bringing
families to Detroit and showing
them how positive of an experi-
ence coming to the area can be,
Kidpreneur can act as a catalyst
for a ripple effect. More kids in
the area could help bring other
kid-friendly businesses to the city,
which could help boost the econ-
omy and develop an entirely kid-
friendly community.
As for those children in Detroit
and elsewhere, Tran strives to
make his classes available for
students of all socio-economic
backgrounds. Kidpreneur hopes
to bring entrepreneurship every-
where in order to help children
realize their potential.
Kids realizing
their potential.
There are plenty of parents
who start their kids off in little
league sports, much fewer who
bring their children to downtown
Detroit, and even fewer still that
bring their kids to Detroit to learn
entrepreneurial skills at a young
age. For all we know, though, the
next little Steve Jobs could be
plunking away feverishly at a com-
puter inside of 1249 Woodward
Avenue, and Detroit's Kidpreneur
will be where he or she will have
taken off.

Why so serious?
DeMarco's mature 'Salad Days'

'Head or Heart' lacks either one

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
DailyArts Writer
It's cute, alright. But in today's
music industry, cute doesn't cut it.
For someone whose first song
debuted on
"Dancing with
the Stars" in
2010, Chris- Head or
tina Perri estab-
lished herself Heart
in the industry Christina Perri
quite quickly.
With a voice Atlantic
that was unlike
any other at the
time, Perri sold nearly half a mil-
lion copies of her debut record,
Lovestrong.
on the second time around,
her album Head or Heart develops
themes of self reflection and per-
sonal relationships through light
pop, as Perri strays away from cre-
ating yet another album entirely of
love and heartbreak anthems. In
the process, however, Perri loses
the virility and intensity that high-
lighted her debut.
The albumis ordinary, plain and
unconnected to any emotions that
could truly impact most listeners.
In fact, for a record that's titled
Head or Heart, Perri's record does
very little to appeal to either. Unre-
latable and obscure tracks such
as "Burning Gold" and "Lonely
Child" would have been forgivable
had they been lyrically impress-
ible or melodically innovative. But
neither of those qualities show up
anywhere on the album. It's evi-

Cute doesn't cut it, Christina.
dent that the credit for the echoing
fervor in "I Don't Wanna Break"
isn't due to the song itself, but to
Perri's interpretation, and beyond
an appreciation for the refinement
in Perri's voice, there's very little
keepingthe album relevant.
"Be My Forever," featuring Brit-
ish singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran,
is reminiscent of Sheeran's last
feature on Taylor Swift's "Every-
thing Has Changed," as a songthat
induces a smile but does very little
to prove either artist as someone
who's worthpayingattention to.
That's not saying the the album
doesn't have strengths, particularly
when it comes to Perri's vocals.
With a voice that flows like honey,
Perri has the ability to sing of pain
andlheartbreak inasoothingmelan-
choly and her voice bleeds emotion
with every word. Her enunciations
are comforting in their melody and
there's a perfection in her pitch that
shows the strength in Perri'sjudge-
ment and the understanding she
has over her own voice.
Her higher register in "Trust" is

sharp, and though painful to listen
to at first, her high notes contain a
poignancy that relays the meaning
of the song even before paying heed
to the lyrics. In "Human," Perri
manages to convey heartbreak and
tribulation effortlessly by using
nothing other than the syrupy tone
in her voice.
Perhaps, then, all criticism
toward Head or Heart stems from
the expectations set by Perri's
debut, Lovestrong. By combin-
ing sweet, sugary pop with the
dark undertones, she innovatively
brought her own sound to pop
music at the time. Tracks such as
"Mine" and "Tragedy" added a
certain depth to pop that had been
long absent from the charts. The
infamous "Jar of Hearts" shaped
Perri as someone who had a clear
sense of her purpose and identity
in the industry.
But now that we already know
Perri has' an inherent talent
unmatched by many others in her
field, it's time to see her go beyond
that.

Per usual, most songs on
DeMarco's Salad Days end briskly
around the three minute mark,
and the record flows quickly and
succinctly as a traditional pop
album, for the most part. "Broth-
er," another exceptional track,
takes the gleaming guitar chords
of 2 and slows things down to a sul-

two tracks later, though, with the
dreadfully boring "Let My Baby
Stay," in which DeMarco floats
cutesy lyrics alongside an unbear-
ably repetitious acoustic guitar
without ever reaching any sem-
blance of crescendo or memorable
chorus.
on the surface, Salad Days is
a very straightforward record -
simple, direct, efficiently accessi-
ble. In an era where any important
work of art has essentially the
same quantifiable, societal impor-
tance as a picture of some hot
chick baring cleavage on Insta-
gram, it makes sense that artists
are starting to make their work
more minimalist and pop-like in
nature, perhaps recognizing and
accepting the inevitable ephemer-
ality of their work. Mac DeMarco
might be too much of a goofball
spaz to sit down and put together
a complex, artistic masterpiece,
but who really needs Art when you
can learn to take it sloooowly bro-

COMEDY CENTRAL
The joke is probably on you.
'Broad City'ends
with a bold finale

AMC

Season one shows
Abbi and Ilana are
just getting started
By ERIKA HARWOOD
Senior Arts Editor
At this point, it's almost for-
givable for TV shows to have a
rocky first season. In my review
of "Broad City"
's first epi-
sode, I cited
the first season Broad City
(and a half)
of "Parks and Season Finale
Recreation" Comedy Central
as an example
of a show that
needed some time to turn into
one of the greatest shows cur-
rently on television. Also in that
review, I noted the strength
of "Broad City" 's own pilot -
fearless women holding noth-
ing back for the sake of comedy.
It was the strongest premiere
episode in recent recollection
and surprisingly (I say surpris-

ingly because I have no idea
how anyone is capable of this in
any genre on TV), "Broad City"
sustained that aggressive, spot-
on comedic genius for its entire
first season.
In "The Last Supper," Abbi
and Ilana head to an upscale res-
taurant for Abbi's 26th birthday
- thanks to her dad, who's foot-
ing the bill. To the blatant dis-
approval of the host, Abbi rocks
the same teal bodycon dress
she wore earlier in the season
while Ilana sports a glittering
gold crop top and matching mini
skirt. While they made it clear
early on that the night will not
go well, it's completely impossi-
ble to predict the outlandish and
incredible turns it'll take.
As Ilana knowingly feeds her
shellfish allergy, Abbi takes the
world's most memorable bath-
room trip. As things spiral fur-
ther out of control, we're graced
with frequent interludes of their
seemingly poised waiter going
to the kitchen to have scream-
ing fights with his chef girl-
friend, played by Amy Poehler

("Parks and Recreation") who
also directed the episode.
Jacobson and Glazer have
somehow managed to craft
something that many series are
unable to manage during their
entire tenure: a comedy that's
raunchy, witty, relatable and
every so often, heartfelt. Their
performances show off their
talents as UCB-raised sketch
performers while also shining a
light on their fantastic writing.
Normally I'd worry about a
show starting off so well, ques-
tioning its ability to grow or
even maintain what it's estab-
lished. But I have no worries
about "Broad City" - whether it
be my faith in the broads behind
it or my own fervent anticipa-
tion for season two - Jacob-
son and Ilana have proven that
they have what it takes to cre-
ate a brilliant show in just ten
episodes. Regardless of what
"Broad City" does in its subse-
quent seasons, the bold confi-
dence in season one shows that
Abbi and Ilana are just getting
started.

Perfect form.

By CHLOE GILKE
Daily Arts Writer
After a tumultuous season
that saw the departure of fan
favorites and universally-
hated vil-
lains alike
(RIP Her-
shel and The The Walking
Governor), Dead
"The Walking
Dead" capped Season Finale
off with a
refreshing AMC
surprise. Four
seasons in,
"The Walking Dead" proves
that it's never too late to rein-
vent the game. Though the
first half of the season was a
bit repetitive, featuring Rick
and the prison gang chas-
ing The Governor around the
woods, the last eight episodes
have been more of a charac-
ter study. Episodes followed
characters who rarely had
the opportunity to be fully
fleshed out before and new
pairings explored dynamics
between conflicting person-
alities. Sure, there were just
as many gory zombie kills, but
this season of "The Walking
Dead" proved that the show
has matured beyond shock
tactics and grisly deaths to
sustain its ratings. It's not a
show about the zombies, but
the humans who are just as
capable of being monstrous.
The finale, wonderfully
directed by "Breaking Bad"
veteran Michelle MacLaren,
was an almost perfect execu-
tion of the new precedent the
show set this season. Focus-
ing mostly on four characters
(Rick, Carl, Michonne and
Daryl), the episode explored
the consequences of living
in horror. Rick (Andrew Lin-
coln, "Strike Back"), who
had spent the season trying
to live as a peaceful farm-
er, faced his most difficult
decision yet when Carl and

Michonne were in danger of
being assaulted and killed
by a group of monsters even
sicker than the "walkers." He
had tried to stray away from
his leadership responsibilities
and lead a simpler life, but
when it comes down to it, Rick
is, at heart, the epitome of a
sheriff and father. He can't
avoid his duty to look after
his own. No matter how much
he eschews violence, some-
times there's no other option
than to bite into a man's neck
when his friend's got a gun
to your son's head. Rick has
finally accepted responsibil-
ity for his actions in the zom-
bie apocalypse, and his new
badass attitude is sure to be a
highlight of season five.
Besides Rick showing
strength of character (which
is ' pretty unprecedented,
actually), "The Walking
Dead" threw viewers another
surprise when not a single
important character died in a
finale episode. Yes, the same
show that killed off two lit-
tle girls just a few weeks ago
spent an entire episode with-
out spilling a drop of blood.
Again, this is a hopeful direc-
tion for the show's next sea-
son. Too often, "The Walking
Dead" relies on shock and
gruesome violence to drive
its sluggish plot. But by flesh-
ing out its supporting charac-
ters and taking advantage of a
fresh new setting, the action
has picked up the pace and no
longer relies on gunshots to
keep a viewer's attention.
But that's not to say that the
danger and exigency have to
be sacrificed with the absence
of death. The scene in which
Carl (Chandler Riggs, "Get
Low") and Michonne (Danai
Gurira, "The Visitor") are
imperiled is particularly poi-
gnant. In the zombie apoca-
lypse, it's easy to create a new
identity and be the badass
you always wanted to be in

the real world (see: The Gov-
ernor). But some vulnerabili-
ties are inevitable. Michonne
may wield a deadly katana,
but she is still the target of
male sexual violence. Carl is
handy with a gun and tough as
nails, but he's still just a kid
who can't overpower a punch
stronger than his own. Rather
than pitting these characters,
made even more interesting
this season by heartbreaking
backstories, against brain-
less zombies and dull villains,
the show's new quietude
allows them to face their own
demons.
Even as the
action died
down, ratings
multiplied.
"The Walking Dead" is still
far from perfect. Its female
characters are dying faster
than you can say "Andrea, pick
up those pliers!" and some
lines of dialogue are laugh-
able (see: "they're screwing
with the wrong people"). But
this season saw vast strides of
improvement. The fact that a
series with such ridiculously
high ratings can hold on to
its viewership even through
entire episodes without Daryl
Dixon or a cool zombie kill is
unprecedented. Even as the
action died down for charac-
ter study, viewers and ratings
still multiplied every week.
Like it or not, "The Walking
Dead" is a television jugger-
naut and will likely be around
for a while. But at least it
has proven that it's capable
of introspection and quiet
moments - and, of course,
can still stage a good blood-
bath.

DO YOU EVER STAND
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROAD AT NIGHT AND FEEL
INSIGNIFICANT UNDER
THE IMMENSE UNIVERSE
TOWERING ABOVE YOU?
GOOD. NEITHER DO WE.

:Michigan's freshman star

'M' takes second at
Hoya Invitational

By CINDY YU
Daily Sports Writer
Making the lineup as
a freshman is impressive,
especially when upprclassmen
composethemajorityoftheteam.
Even more impressive is a
gymnast who competes in the
all-around after graduating
high school in just three years.
What's extraordinary is
if that athlete wins Big Ten
Freshman of the Year.
Becoming the first Wolverine
since 2006 to earn the honor,
Nicole Artz has consistently
proven to be a key asset to
the No. 7 Michigan women's
gymnastics team.
"I was going to be very
shocked if she didn't win that
award, because week in and
week out, she has been absolutely
rock solid," said Michigan coach
Bev Plocki.
Artz hadn't even expected
herself to be in the lineup this
season, let alone gain recognition
from the conference. The team
was loaded with juniors and
seniors, and coaches made no
promises that she'd, compete
right away.
"It's not something that I
would have thought was possible
at the beginning of the year,"
Artz said.
The Holland, Mich. native
has competed in at least two
events in every meet this season.
A four-time Big Ten Freshman
of the Week, Artz was also
named to the All-Big Ten First
Team. She holds a career-high
score of 9.900 on the uneven
bars and balance beam and has
scored 9.900 or higher seven
times on her favorite event, the
floor exercise.
From her teammates to the
senior leadership and coaching
staff, Artz has had a seamless
transition to the realm of college
gymnastics. The heightened

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Freshman Nicole Artz has esceeded evens her own expectatios this season, winning Big Ten Freshman of the Year.

team atmosphere has helped her
the most in her adjustment.
"In club gymnastics ... it's
much more individual-based,"
Artz said. "Here, no matter what
happens, your team is always
going to be there for you."
But despite her success, she
wasn't always perfect. At the
tri-meet against UCLA and
Utah on March 7, Artz fell for
the first time all season on beam
in the leadoff position. The five
gymnasts who followed each hit
their routines, dropping her score
from the team total and resulting
in an event season-high and a win
over two top-10 teams.
"I had tears in my eyes
because I was so happy," Artz
said. "It's just the feeling that
you wouldn't expect or get in
club gymnastics - knowing that
they always have your back."
In a quad meet the following
week, her training ability was
limited because of the flu.
However, her mental toughness
guided her to not only overcome
her beam fluke the previous

week, but also obtain a season-
best score of 9.900 on the event.
Since coming to Michigan,
Artz has upgraded her floor
routine, adding a piked full-in
tumbling pass, which consists
of two back flips in the air with
a full-twist completed in the
first. On bars, she completes
an entirely different routine,
including her first-ever major
release, apiked Tkatchev.
"From a coaching standpoint,
she has absorbed everything
that we've changed, whether
it be new techniques or drills,"
Plocki said. "She has just
embraced everything we've
given her and has grown so
much in her confidence and her
difficulty."
Artz committed to Michigan
the summer after her sophomore
year but had her eyes set on the
program long before that. After
visiting the Donald R. Shepherd
Training Center with the
Region S Hi-Tech Gymnastics
Training Camp in eighth grade,
she was hooked.

"The facility doesn't get much
better than this," Artz said.
The gymnast came to
Michigan in style,boostinga club
career that included winningthe
2012 Junior Olympic National
Championships floor title and
traveling to Rio de Janeiro as
part of the Region 5 All-Star
Team in 2011.
That experience has helped
her all year. While she is the
youngest member of the squad,
Artz looks more like a seasoned
veteran than a freshman on the
competition floor.
"You would never know she
graduated school a year early
unless she told you," said fifth-
year senior Natalie Beilstein.
"She is very mature for her age
and always willing to help out in
any way she can. "
Artz is the type of gymnast
every coach loves - consistent
and reliable. What you see at
meets is an exact replica of what
you see in practice.
And the best part? She has
three years left.

The cherry blossoms weren't
the only thing blooming in
Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.
Michigan finished second
at the Hoya Invitational at
Georgetown with a total score of
611, just four behind first-place
Pennsylvania. No Wolverine
finished lower than 20th out of
86 golfers.
The match was shortened
from 54 to 36 holes due to
inclement weather Monday and
Sunday's practice round was
also scrapped.
"It was another solid
tournament," said Michigan
coach Jan Dowling. "We
overcame the bad weather in the
first round and played even better
in the second round. I was really
proud of the way we finished."
Michigan's best finish came
from junior Lauren Grogan. She
finished in a tie for second with
a score of 150, just four strokes
behind Pennsylvania's Amanda
Chin. Grogan's performance
included five birdies.
"Lauren played really well
under pressure," Dowling said.
"That was something really
great to see."
Freshman Grace Choi also
put up another impressive
performance. Fresh off her
second-place finish at the Clover
Cup Invitational, she shot a 73 in
the second round to place fourth
with a total score of 151. Choi
had four birdies in the match.
"Although (Choi's) shot
handling wasn't quite what
she wanted it to be, she felt
great about her second round,"
Dowling said. "Her finish was
really strong."
Senior Yugene Lee made
a huge jump with her

performance. Following her
64th-place showing at the
Clover Cup, she tied for 10th
with 155, which included a 75
in the second round. It was her
highest finish since the 2012 Big
Ten Championships, where she
placed second.
Fellow senior Alyssa Shimel
bounced back from finishing
58th at the Clover Cup and
placed into a tie for 20th place
with 158. Her performance
included three birdies and one
eagle.
Sophomore Catherine Peters
rounded out Michigan's scoring,
tying with Shimel for 20th,
including four birdies.
"Catherine is a great athlete,"
Dowling said. "She had a great
performance and finished much
better than at the Clover Cup."
The Wolverines' second-place
finish was their best showing
of the season and their best
since winning the Rio Verde
Intercollegiate Invitational
in March 2010. Michigan also
finished fourth at the Clover
Cup Invitational two weeks ago.
Dowling attributed the success
to the team buying into what
the coaching staff is selling,
and establishing a good routine,
which has increased confidence.
With the Wolverines' recent
improvement, it's tempting
to look ahead to the Big Ten
Championships, but Dowling is
making sure to keep Michigan
focused on next week's Marsh
Landing Invitational in
Jacksonville, Fla.
"You have to take it one
day at a time," Dowling said.
"We're going to continue to
make adjustments and fine
tune our game so that we can
continue getting better. It will
also be nice to be able to finally
practice outside."

"That's the way the game falls,

DRIESENGA GETTING
BACK ON TRACK: Less than a
year removed from three College
World Series appearances,
Driesenga struggled at the
beginning of the season, starting
0-3 with a 3.44 earned-run
average through March 8.
Since then, she has pitched
13.2 innings while giving up only
one run, including a five-inning
shutout against Penn State.
Driesenga and Hutchins
said earlier in the season that
her main problem was a lack of
confidence.Inthe past few weeks,
Driesenga has regained some of
that confidence by getting into a
rhythm in practice.
"Just making sure the ball's
moving, staying sharp in those
aspects," Driesenga said. "Every
pitch in the bullpen does count,
just like it does in the game."
Hutchins agreed that the
junior has recaptured some
of the bite that earned her
three shutouts last postseason,
including two in the regional
round.
"She's starting to throw
with a little better confidence,"
Hutchins said. "She's working
ahead in the count. Her drop ball
is really biting. And honestly,
she's swinging a heck of a bat.
That's just a sign of confidence."
MIDWEEK MERCY:
Michigan announced Tuesday
that it will play Detroit in a
nonconference game Wednesday.
The Titans (2-18) should be
a midweek tune-up for this
weekend's home series against
Ohio State. Detroit comes into
Ann Arbor on a 13-game losing
streak, with just two of those
coming against ranked teams.
The Wolverines haven't played
Detroit since 2001 and haven't
lost to the Titans since 1984. They
lead the all-time series, 22-3, have
shut out Detroit nine times and
have scored in double digits on
five occasions.

Baseball welcomes CMU

The Michigan baseball team is
riding a new wave of momentum
it hasn't seen
all season.
The CMUa
Wolverines Michigan
have won four Matchup:

five games and Michigan

streak to three 6 P.M.
when Central Where: Ray
Michigan visits Fisher Stadium
the brand-new
turf at Ray
Fisher Stadium on Wednesday.
Since beating Indiana nearly
two weeks ago, the Wolverines
have been a completely
different team. Michigan has
increased its quality at-bat
percentage, has been aggressive
on the base path, boasts a near-
perfect fielding percentage, and
its starting pitchers combined
for a 1.08 earned-run average
last weekend.
"I'm pleased with the way
we've played defense in the past
week," said Michigan coach
Erik Bakich. "I'd say we're good
defensively and have shown
flashes of being great, but we're
not elite yet."
Perhaps the biggest plus for

Michigan, though, is its ability
to defend the basepaths. The
Wolverineslimited Iowa -which
led the conference in stolen bases
prior to the weekend series - to
only one steal.
Senior catcher Cole Martin
hasplayedaprincipalrole inthat.
He has thrown out six runners
in 13 attempts - a respectable
45-percentage average. Martin
boasts one of the team's
strongest arms and throws with
near-perfect accuracy. Prior to
the season, Martin was named
to the Johnny Bench Award
Watch List, which is given to the
nation's best catcher, and he's
justifying the selection.
"We're a good base-stealing
team, so our defense and
pitching is good at practicing
against a good base stealing
team," Bakich said.
Left-hander Logan McAnallen
will make his fourth start for the
Wolverines on Wednesday. The
fifth-year senior boasts a meager
1-3 record to date, and has had
an off year. But Bakich knows
McAnallen can be as good as
anyone when he pitches at the
top of his form.
"(McAnallen's) a guy that
relies on his ability to pound
the strike zone, and when he
throws his fastball in, he's very
successful," Bakich said. "He's
one of our toughest guys.
"He's the man's man: He likes

to hunt, fish and work on muscle
cars, and when he pitches like a
guy who likes to hunt, fish and
work on muscle cars, then he's
always very successful."
The Chippewas have yet to
name their starting pitcher.
But the news hasn't been all
positive. Michigan found out
it would be without freshman
third baseman Ramsey
Romano for eight weeks. While
attempting to tag a runner out
on Friday, Romano was slid into
by an Iowa runner. An MRI on
Monday showed he'd broken
two bones in his left hand. It's
unclear whether Romano will
be cleared to return for this
season, or if he can obtain a
medical redshirt.
Freshman infielder Trey
Miller will replace Romano at
third base. Miller has proven to
be successful both offensively
and defensively in the two
games he has started. Miller got
his first career hit on Saturday,
and it was a big one. He lined a
two-run single that ended up
making the difference.
Central Michigan has a
few strong hitters of its own,
headlined by Logan Regnier,
who is batting .365.
"Every game is very
important, and we have to treat
it that way," said junior left
fielder Kyle Jusick. "There's
really no difference."

Junior pitcher Sara Driesenga has rebounded after a poor start to the season.

Season in review: 2013-14 'M' hockey

Position-by-
position grades
By JEREMY SUMMITT and
ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Editor and
Daily Sports Writer
In a season with high highs
and even lower lows, a second
straight Michigan hockey season
without an NCAA Tournament
appearance is tough to swallow.
Despite a talent-filled roster, one
unit's weakness emerged often
enough to overshadow another's
hot streak, and ultimately, the
Wolverines became the first team
out on Selection Sunday.
With hindsight at 20/20, the
Daily grades Michigan's season.
Forwards: The team lacked
a dominant scoring threat
all season, which eventually
cost it a berth in the NCAA
Tournament. Say what you want
about forwards freshman JT
Compher, sophomore Andrew
Copp and junior Alex Guptill, but
they came up short in separating
themselves as elite scoring
options when Michigan needed
one most. That's not to say the
trio isn't loaded with talent, but
the Wolverines never had that
go-to guy up top in late-game
situations.
Despite averaging 3.06 goals
per game, the offensive unit could
never string together more than
a few impressive performances
in a row. The Wolverines scored
seven goals in three separate
games throughout the year, and
an abundance of potential was
present from the beginning of
the season. But when the offense
went cold, finding the net was
like trying to dig through ice with
a toothpick.
Grade: B-
Defense: At one point in the
season - the point at which the
Wolverines had only one loss to
blemish a record that included
wins over Boston College and

Boston University - the fledgling
defense was asked to produce
more on offense.
At one point in the season,
freshmenNolanDeJong, Michael
Downing and Kevin Lohan filled
the voids left by former Michigan
defensemen Jacob Trouba and
Jon Merrill, and they did it
admirably. Guided by seniors
Mac Bennett and Kevin Clare,
the unit made an offense that
netted fewer than three goals a
game look good.
But by the end, Michigan's
top four defensemen - Bennett,
Clare, Downing and junior Sinelli
- combined for just 44 points.
Bennett finished with 14 points,
the captain's lowest, total since
his freshman year.
This inexperienced unit was
predicted to be the weak point
for a program that emphasized
defense en route to 22 straight
NCAA Tournament appearances.
But no one could have
predicted defensive blunders
from veteran players. No one
could have foreseen three
turnovers-turned-goals that
turned a 3-1 lead into a 4-3 loss to
the Nittany Lions, just as no one
could have predicted a Bennett
gaffe three weeks later against
the same, lowly opponent.
Grade: C-
Special Teams: One of
the most evident strengths of
Michigan's season was its special
teams play. The power-play unit
ranked 22nd in the nation with a
19.55-percent success rate. Tied
for second in the Big Ten with
eight power-play goals, senior
forward Luke Moffatt played a
pivotal role all season on the man
advantage.
Meanwhile, the penalty
kill didn't fare quite as well
statistically with an 81.7-percent
success rate, ranking 33rd in the
nation. However, the Wolverines
did accumulate four shorthanded
goals. Three came from Compher
- good for the best mark in the
Big Ten.
At one point in the season,

Michigan surrendered just
two power-play goals despite
taking 21 penalties in a six-game
span. While the impressive
performance on the defensive
end didn't translate into positive
results - the Wolverines went
2-3-0-1 in those games -
Michigan coach Red Berenson
had been preaching consistent
penalty killing. Perhaps that
was the lone consistent effort
his squad displayed for much
of the year, but it was certainly
something to hold in high regard.
Grade: B+
Goaltending: Sixty-three
times in the first round of the Big
Ten Tournament against Penn
State, freshman goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort gave his team another
chance to salvage its season. One
more save and a goal from his
teammates, and the Wolverines
may very well be practicing at
Yost Ice Arena this week.
Instead, Nagelvoort was
screened midway through the
second overtime frame, and his
school record-breaking effort
became the last of his freshman
campaign.
Without strength at the
position, some of the Wolverines'
nine one-goal wins are losses.
Though the last two years
of Michigan hockey ended
without an NCAA Tournament
appearance, perhaps the most
striking difference between the
2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons was
goaltending. Last season, from
a horse race of disappointing
candidates, then-freshman Steve
Racine emerged as a leader,
taking the Wolverines to a CCHA
final and earning himself the
starting job come September.
But when the sophomore
suffered a groin injury, it seemed
consistency would be a luxury
Michigan couldn't afford for a
second straight season.
In the sophomore's place,
Nagelvoort, a late commit out
of the NAHL, provided coaches
with an almost-happy problem -
two reliable starting goaltenders.

Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson's teams have now failed to reach the NCAA Tournament in consecutive seasons.

For much of December and
January, Berenson made his
decisions on a nightly basis,
giving the nod to the goalie who
performed best most recently,
and forcing the two to compete
during the week. After seven
consecutive starts, when it
seemed like Nagelvoort would
be first on the depth chart each
night, a slip-up against Penn
State in February forced him
onto the bench against No. 1
Minnesota.
Ultimately, Nagelvoort - who
finished the season with a .929
save percentage, allowing just
2.20 goals per game - established
himself as an elite netminder
along the way and, after weeks of
uncertainty, received the starting
role when it mattered most.
But like this season,
consistency in net came just a
little too late.
Grade: A-

Canteen shining, Hagerup returns

It may only be a few weeks
into spring football practice, but
the early-enrollees are already
making waXes.
Defensive NOTEBOOK
tackle Bryan
Mone and offensive tackle Mason
Cole have been the talk of the
upperclassmen, but leading the
pack in recent practices is wide
receiver Freddy Canteen, who
has emerged as a viable option in
Michigan's passing game. With
a thin receiving corps, Canteen's
hands and polished route
running are a welcome surprise
for the Wolverines.
Canteen expects to make plays
in the fall and calls himself the
fastestplayer on the team.
"I believe he's the second
fastest, to me," joked freshman
safety Brandon Watson. "But he's

Watson and Canteen have
been teammates since the
summer after seventh grade,
and the two decided to continue
the tradition when they both
committed to Michigan on the
same day. But it doesn't end
there - the two friends are also
roommates and have been going
up against each other almost
every day in
practice. -

The Daily looks
back on the best
and worst of the
2013-14 campaign
By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
It was all going so well, wasn't
it? The Michigan hockey team
was 10-2-2 and had climbed as
high as No. 2 in the national polls.
The Wolverines had stellar goal-
tending, luck and just enough
offense to look like contenders
for both Big Ten and national
championships.
You know the rest. On Dec.
27, Western Michigan exposed a
porous defense like no other team
had, adding an emphatic conclu-
sion with the game-winning goal
on a fantastic individual play by
Josh Pitt with 19 seconds remain-
ing in overtime. Thanks to more
surprisingly poor play and some
badly timed bye weeks, the Wol-
verines didn't win a game until
nearly a month later.
Michigan lost to Penn State in
the opening round of the Big Ten
Tournament, finishing the sec-
ond half of the season with a sub-
.500 record that had turned the
Wolverines into a middling team
and placed them squarely on the
NCAA Tournamentbubble.
BEST WIN: It's easy to point
to the Wolverines' 6-2 win over
No. 1 Minnesota on the final day
of the regular season as their
biggest moment of the season.
And, to be fair, Michigan needed
that result to have any chance at
an NCAA Tournament at-large
bid. But the Golden Gophers had
already clinched the Big Ten title
and played like it, taking some of
the luster off of the rout.
In retrospect, the Wolverines'
biggest win was their season-
opening 3-1 triumph over Boston
College. They held the Eagles'
two Hobey Baker Award finalists,
Kevin Hayes and Johnny
Gaudreau, to just four total shots
and no goals. Sophomore forward
Andrew Copp picked up a goal
and two assists for Michigan,
feeding senior forward Luke
Moffatt with a cross-ice pass that
put the team up by two early in
the third period.
WORST LOSS: Here are four
for the price of one.
* Dec. 28: In the consolation
game of the Great Lakes
Invitational, Michigan lays an
egg against Michigan State.
Sophomore goaltender Steve
Racine makes 37 saves, but the
offense stagnates in the 3-0
defeat. If the Wolverines find
a way to win, they likely earn
an at-large bid to the NCAA
Tournament in March.
* Feb. 8: A day after embar-
rassing Penn State, the Nittany
Lions return the favor. Freshman
netminder Zach Nagelvoort sur-

renders three goals on the first
nine shots he faces, and Michi-
gan can't find twine all night as
Penn State picks up its first-ever
Big Ten win, 4-0. If the Wolver-
ines find a way to win, they likely
earn an at-large bid to the NCAA
Tournament in March.
* Feb. 21: With 4.6 seconds
left in regulation, the Nittany
Lions stun the Yost Ice Arena
crowd with a tying goal, and they
eventually finish the overtime
upset, 5-4. If senior defenseman
Mac Bennett clears the puck
instead of making a blind pass,
or Nagelvoort makes one more
save, or the Wolverines put away
the Big Ten's worst team when
they have the chance, they likely
earn an at-large bid to the NCAA
Tournament in March.
* March 20: Needing one win
to all but assure themselves a
spot in the NCAA Tournament,
the Wolverines fall to Penn State
again,2-1, in the first round of the
Big Ten Tournament. In the first
of two overtime periods, Copp
wrists a shot that rattles off the
post and spins on the line but
never fully crosses it. One more
inch and the Wolverines likely
earn an at-large bid to the NCAA
Tournament.
Instead, as Michigan's online
schedule reads, "there are no
upcoming events."
BEST GAME: If any one
game showcased Michigan's
maddening inconsistency, it
was the March 14 meeting with
Minnesota. The Wolverines
took a 2-1 lead into the first
intermission, pouncing on every
Gopher mistake to the delight of
the raucous crowd at Yost. But
Michigan didn't score the rest of
the way and took five penalties in
a 3-2 overtime loss.
The Wolverines demonstrated
their ability to go toe to toe with
the nation's best team. Minnesota
was fighting to clinch first place
in the Big Ten and played like
it, and Michigan still delivered
a blow in the first period. That
scoring touch disappeared in
the final 40 minutes and into
overtime, but the Wolverines
hung on for dear life, coming
just 136 seconds from a tie that
would've likely earned them a

THE VISUAL STATEMENT: SUBMERGE
BY ALDEN REISS
Iphotographed the Michigan swimming and diving teams underwater for my senior
thesis project. The photographs that compiled for my upcoming show, Submerge, act as a
vessel through which I explore the physical transformation that takes place when a human
enters the water. Having almost drowned as a child, water often evokes feelings of fear and
danger for me despite its natural beauty. This project helped relieve those feelings, as I
made images in which humans seem to have control over their bodies beneath the surface
of the water. This would not have been possible without the athleticism and comfort that
these collegiate - and some Olympic - athletes have in the pool. Some images evoke
feelings of reflection while others are more aggressive and explosive. Some suggest flight
while others suggest stillness. What ties them all together is that these bodies, though
submerged, appear free.
Submerge will be on view starting Friday April19 in the Starnps School of Art and Design Undergraduate Thesis Show.

THE liSt BUZZFEED, BUT BETTER
Five birth control options for the future
As the number of birth control options multiply, choosing
among options becomes the real challenge, and weighing out
the pros and cons of various methods becomes an overwhelming
task. But in reality, we haven't even seen the half of it.
Men's Club
For years, scientists have been researching possible hormonal
contraceptive options for men, but have hita roadblock. However,
in India, researchers have found that a non-hormonal contraception
injection called RISUG might just do the trick.
Emergency Gel
While emergency contraceptives - such as Plan B - are
minimally recommended by physicians as a form of regular birth
control, the efficacy of emergency contraception might just
increase once the gel is put out in the market.
Downsize those IUDs
According to the ACOG, reversible contraception methods, such
as intrauterine devices, are the most effective kind of reversible
birth control in the market. Downsizing those IUDs to be smaller
and more comfortable might be the way to do that.
A once a year thing
The biggest danger with prescription contraception is that
manyetimes, it requires you to periodically remember to replace
or retake the birth control. Contraception which you only have to
replace once a year - such as a pill or a vaginal ring - could be
the solution.
CycleBeads
The Standard Days Methods is newly developed for women
who want to take more natural methods when protecting from
pregnancy. Using a system of beads that are monitored daily, SDM
advises women to pay attention to their hormonal cycles and avoid
times when pregnancy is most likely.

But why? No, I wasn't at Skeeps

early with one mission in mind:
to get Lollapalooza passes.

"You're an expatriate. You've lost touch
with the soil. You get precious. Fake Euro-
pean standards have ruined you. You drink
yourself to death. You become obsessed with
sex. You spend all your time talking, not
working. You are an expatriate, see? You
hang around cafes."
- Ernest Hemingway, "The Sun Also
Rises"
We've all been asked at least once in col-
lege "What did you want to be when you
grew up?" Presumably, the answer is sup-
posed to be funny, in either a lighthearted
- "haha I wanted to be a fireman" - sort of
way, or a self-deprecating, "I used to want
to be an archaeologist, but now I'm content
to be a pencil pusher." My answers have
mostly been of the former variety; appar-
ently, when I was three or four, I wanted
to be "a doorman or a squirrel." Don't ask,
because I have no idea.
For the last year or two, when that ques-
tion is reworked and I'm asked what I want
to be after I graduate, my go-to answer is
always the same - I want to be a writer.
I've successfully brushed off any follow-up
questions about what type of writing I plan
to do by claiming that I'm still figuring it
all out. But here's a question I have trouble
answering - what exactly do I mean when
I say I want to be a writer?
Obviously, I can answer by saying that I
want to be a writer because I want to write.
But that would be a lie, or a half-lie to be
more precise. Let's examine the diction. I
don't say that I want to write for a living -
I say that I want to be a writer. Because for
me, being a writer has moved beyond the
craft and become tied to a certain lifestyle,
a persona, an all-encompassing image that
I find myself drawn to and disgusted by.
But let's start at the beginning.
As a kid, I had weird reading habits. I
would read the same books over and over

again, yet refuse to read anything new. My
parents gave me some Hemingway to read,
just "The Old Man and the Sea" and some
of the short stories. I liked them, but I cer-
tainly didn't have an epiphanic moment
that inspired me, right then and there, to
become a writer. My mom gave me more
Hemingway, this time in the form of a mem-
oir by A.E. Hotchner recounting his decade
long friendship with Papa. I couldn't read it
fast enough, leaving saucy fingerprints all
over the pages as I ate dinner, but devoured
the descriptions of marlin fishing, daiquiri
drinking and schmoozing with Sartre and
his mistress. "Man," I thought, "I want to
be him when I grow up."
It was fun playing Hemingway for
awhile. I bought a guayabera, poured dash-
es of rum into glasses of coke and called
them Cuba Libres, tried to take an inter-
est in boxing and spoke epigrammatically
about the nature of life and death whenever
I caught a fish.
At this point, you're probably wondering
where this essay is going. Or, more likely,
you're thinking "So what?" What I've
described may sound like nothing more
than a game of teenage dress-up, a more
mature version of when I used to don my
grandmother's old sun hat and a laptop bag
and call myself Indiana Jones.
The distinction is that when you're
seven years old, no one expects you to be
an archaeologist. But at my age, adopting
the visage is quickly becoming insufficient
without some results, or at least serious
preparations for them. And it goes without
saying that reading Hemingway and read-
ing about Hemingway, are two very differ-
ent things.
I did grow out of the Hemingway one.
But just as Ernest grew tired of his wives, I
grew tired of simply emulating him. Lucki-
ly, the writer persona is a drug sold by every
newspaper, magazine and blog. Profiles

and interviews of writers, not their actual
work, became my texts of choice. A New
Yorker profile? Better than a new novel.
I've gone through many different love
affairs with authors' Wikipedia pages, butI
can split those writers into four basic cate-
gories. There's the cosmopolitan polemicist
(Christopher Hitchens, Pier Paolo Paso-
lini), the rustic man's man (Hemingway,
Jim Harrison), the counterculture libertine
(Hunter S Thompson, Charles Bukowski)
and the passionate polymath (Susan Son-
tag, David Foster Wallace). You can already
see some recurring motifs - socialite, well-
recorded vices, prolific output, complicated
love life, toes the line between academia
and the public, wide-ranging interests and
a general aura of ... "cool."
In fact, I've met one of my writer-idols.
Sebastian Junger, author of "The Per-
fect Storm," war correspondent and gen-
eral badass, gave a talk in Cape Cod that
I attended. After he finished there was a
book signing, where I approached him
with the same cautious reverence that
I imagine one would approach a Swami
with. As I shook his muscular, callused
hand, I imagined that we were silently
acknowledging our affinity, that I was
telling him that I wanted to be him when
I grew up. I asked him to sign my book. He
spelled my name wrong. He said "next."
I spent the next week thinking "I really
fucked that one up." It was as if I had read
all of his books not for the information
they contained, but to sustain a fantasy
that behind the books there was a someone
who one day I could be.
I won't psychoanalyze myself too much
- not out of a fear of discovering some
dark repressed secret. Rather, it's because
the source of my attraction to the writer
persona is pretty obvious. If you grow up
- and especially go through high school
- as nerdy and not particularly social, the

idea that you can combine smart and sexy
is intoxicating. In other words, if you can
emerge from your dorm room, unshaven,
wearing only pajama bottoms, claiming
that you're "going out for a smoke," and still
feel cool, you become seduced.
What happens when you become seduced
by the writer persona?
You frequent coffee shops. You drink
your coffee black.
You wear a bathrobe all day.
You buy a three-pack of moleskins, and
although you label them "fiction," "poetry,"
and "journalism," you don't really write
much in them.
You refer to someone you're hooking up
with as your "paramour." You use the term
"brief but passionate."
You start smoking by just puffing on
bummed Parliaments. Then you move to
blue American Spirits. Then black. Then
you start rolling your own, and roll them
during conversations. Finally, you get an
E-Cig, so the world will know that you
need nicotine to fuel your creative energy.
Because illness is metaphor, right?
You carry small books in your jacket
pockets.
You must tell everyone, at every party,
what substances you are on, and how much
you consumed.
You buy Playboy for the articles, but are
easily distracted.
You read a profile of Leon Wieseltier,
literary editor of The New Republic, and
you read this sentence, "Next came well-
reported excesses, which included heavy "A

flurry of infidelities finished his marriage."
You feel a pang of envy.

Pick your protection: The impact of contraception usage on campus
by Amrutha Sivakumar

At least getting protected isn't the hard
part.
While college is a time when many stu-
dents choose to explore their sexual free-
dom, universities such as Michigan have
been on the frontline of advancing sexual
health and contraception education.
Prescription contraception was first
introduced in the United States in the
early '60s. While certain progressive states
allowed unmarried women under the age of
21 to seek prescriptions, others did not. Uni-
versity alum Brad Hershbein, an economist
at the W.E. Upjohn Institute, co-authored
an academic paper titled "The Opt-In Revo-
lution? Contraception and the Gender Gap
in Wages" and found that women who had
access to contraception when it was first
introduced often had a different life path
than those who did not.
"They were more likely to enroll in col-
lege, more likely to get a degree, more likely
to get job training when they actually did
enter the workforce," Hershbein said.
Women at the University of Michigan use
contraception at a higher rate than aver-
age when compared to U.S. universities,
according to the National College Health
Assessment survey administered at the Uni-
versity in 2010. Through his research, Her-
shbein concluded that contraception usage
increases with education. Approximately 50
percent of college women nationally are on
birth control at any given time, and consume
contraception at twice the rate of those not
in college before their 40s, he said.
Gwendolyn Chivers, director of Univer-
sity Health Service's ancillary services, said
it is generally a student's personal prefer-
ence where they chose to purchase their
prescription contraception. While the UHS
pharmacy offers some forms of contracep-
tion at lower prices than other pharmacies,
merchandise stores - such as pharmacies
inside grocery stores - offer certain brands
at a less expensive price.
"We make the effort to make sure that we
are in line with as many prescription insur-
ance (plans) as we can be with so that we
can service our students," Chivers said, add-
ing that approximately 80 percent of women
on campus who purchased birth control had
prescriptions covered by health insurance
even prior to the Affordable Care Act.
"Today a lot of birth control is purchased
with health insurance so you don't have to
be concerned of the cost that you used to
have to be worried about," she noted. "Some
prescription insurance carries birth control

at zero copay, and that is all because of the
Affordable Care Act."
A place on campus
Located on the third floor of the UHS
building, the Women's Clinic works with
enrolled students to provide contracep-
tive counseling and prescriptions. Many of
their services are covered by the manda-
tory health service fee that all students are
required to pay.
The physicians at the Women's Clinic
administer "comprehensive contraceptive
counseling" to students who wish to start a
birth control prescription but are not sure of
what type of contraception they are interest-
ed in, said Susan Ernst, chief of UHS Gyne-
cology Services.
As of spring 2013, the American College
Health Association found that 60.4 percent
of college students prefer the birth control
pill as their primary form of contraception,
while 6.5 percent prefer to use an intrauter-
ine device. Recently, national organizations
such as the American College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynecologists have pushed the
University to recognize Long Acting Revers-
ible Contraception methods. according to
Ernst.
"More recently, we are trying to talk about
the most effective methods first," Ernst said.
"In the past we would often talk about the
most used methods - such as birth
control pill, the ring, or the patch - and
then go on to talk about things like the Long
Acting Reversible Contraception - such as
the implant or the IUD."
Ernst added that the possibility of human
error when periodically replacing birth con-
trol pills, patches and rings increases the
chance of unintended pregnancy when com-
pared to LRAC methods. Though barrier
methods of contraception - such as con-
doms, female condoms, dia- phragms and
cervical caps have the least efficacy, Ernst
said the Women's Clinic still offers them to
students as an option.
For University alum Sydney Gallup, for-
mer president of student organization Stu-
dents for Choice, reproductive health is
more than just a personal concern. As a part
of her role in Students for Choice, Gallup sat
through the waiting rooms at UHS, evaluat-
ed informational materials and scrutinized
the location and quality of their available
condoms to evaluate ways to recommend
improvements to the same.
"At the time I was paying $1,000 a year for

pills that for most of the time had horrible
side effects, and I was working a shitty job
downtown to help pay for it," Gallup said. "I
was paying $45 dollars a week, while being a
full-time student, to pay for birth control -
which was pretty silly."
Gallup said she found many of the pam-
phlets were outdated and didn't include
comprehensive information on IUDs. Fur-
thermore, she said the pamphlets did not
help women learn about the questions they
should be asking about their reproductive
health.
"If (UHS) is not going to redirect students
to a place like Planned Parenthood and they
want them to overcome these barriers, they
need to cover all their bases," she said. "Oth-
erwise they're really cheating students from
knowing about reproductive health."
Gallup added that because she believes
contraceptives are often stigmatized on col-
lege campuses, many students she spoke to
found it difficult or embarrassing to take
condoms from UHS. Though the condoms
are offered for free, she said the fact that
they are not placed in a discrete location and
are not from a major brand dissuades stu-
dents from using them.
Located a floor above the Women's Clinic,
sexual health educators at Wolverine Well-
ness also work with students and advise on
contraceptive options. While the Women's
Clinic looks at a patient's medical history
to determine their optimal contraceptive
method, Wolverine Wellness connects
students with public health professionals to
provide general health advice.
Laura McAndrew, a sexual health educa-
tor at Wolverine Wellness, said students are
often concerned about whether their insur-
ance providers would cover contraception
and if their parents would find out about
their contraception usage. While Wolverine
Wellness can't answer many of those ques-
tions directly, it helpspoint students in the
right direction.
A risky affair
As the number of contraceptive options
increase and the Affordable Care Act
improves accessibility, weighing the associ-
ated risks and side effects of contraception
becomes a daunting task for many.
Gallup said she believed the primary
problem with contraception awareness on
campus was misinformation. Anti-Planned
Parenthood protests organized by the
Planned Parenthood Project, and clinics -

such as Arbor Vitae - frequently give out
what she said is false information to women
about their contraceptive options.
"That is a big problem because their
advertisements are really present on cam-
pus," Gallup stressed. "It doesn't help with
the stigma that women oq campus face,
because if they do go there thinking they
can go discuss contraceptive options, they
are essentially shamed out of it."
While contraception options that include
estrogen and progesterone hormones have
inherent risks, including heart attacks and
strokes, Ernst said this was not a major con-
cern for most healthy women. Common side
effects such as nausea and breast tenderness
are typically not dangerous and diminish
over time, she added.
"We always outline those risks but when
you look at the chance of risk for a young,
healthy woman who doesn't have blood
pressure, or cholesterol, or high blood pres-
sure, or smokes, or obesity, then those risks
are even slightly lower than you would see
even in pregnancy," Ernst said. "When you
talk about the risks in context of their other
health (concerns), I think most people are
reassured by the fact that why there are
risks from using hormonal contraception,
the risks are actually fairly low."
Mood changes tend to be a common side
effect of hormonal contraception in the first
few months after starting a prescription,
Ernst said. The Women's Clinic advises stu-
dents to discontinue medication if severe
mood fluctuates persist after an extended
period of time. If mood changes are accom-
panied by other psychiatric issues, Ernst
said she advised those students to seek help
from Counseling and Psychological Servic-
es.
"Patients more often think that weight
gain is caused by their pill and we have to
counsel them that it's probably not the pill,
and maybe there's some other cause for the
gain," she added, referring to the misinfor-
mation that students might have in regards
to side effects.
While the purpose of different University
programs might vary, McAndrew said the
scientific information provided at each was
comparable and the purpose was to provide
women with all the information they might
need so that they could make informed deci-
sions.
"Many students are using birth control,
and we're happy about that, but at the same
time we're happy to be here to address their
concerns," she said.

" W e can see, currently, several hundred
visitors a year - something like 300
or more, and me only being here 18
months, I personally think we're a well-kept
secret," responded Iris Proctor when asked
about Arbor Vitae, a pregnancy counseling cen-
ter, and its relatively low level of notoriety.
Arbor Vitae is tucked away - almost hidden
- in plain sight, down a flight of stairs in the
basement of the building shared by the Star-
bucks on East Liberty. The center has been in its
current location since 2008, starting off as the
Problem Pregnancy Help, Inc. - PPH - in 1972
and working out of Ann Arbor's Father Pat Jack-
son House, a still-active Catholic social-services
establishment that supports pregnant teens.
The assistance that Arbor Vitae offers doesn't
include contraception or a morning-after pill.
Instead, the center acts as an outlet to those
seekingadvice, and advocates taking a pregnan-
cy to term before deciding to move forward with
other options, like an abortion. At the outset,
PPH doesn't profess to offer any medical assis-
tance, opting only for counseling sessions and
free material goods.
"We were started by a mom (Patricia Kay)
with five kids who had never worked outside
her home," said Proctor, Arbor Vitae's execu-
tive director. "She wanted to be able to support
women who she knew were going tobe making a
difficult choice, and she wanted to help women
who were going to choose to parent knowing
that they may be on their own."
Gradually, PPH expanded into a newer loca-
tion on Packard Road and became known as the
Pregnancy Help Center. On Packard, the organi-
zation began to see a gradual increase in visitors
until, finally, its board of directors decided to
move to its current location, closer to the Uni-
versity's campus, in order to respond to the need
for crisis pregnancy intervention. In the new
space, the center adopted its current name.
"We started out primarily giving out free
material goods, and before we moved here, we
realized women needed medical information to
make that decision," Proctor said, referring to
the decision to terminate a pregnancy. "So we
became a medical-based women's health orga-
nization, hence having medical professionals on
staff and offering ultrasound for all the hours
that we're open."
However, many groups who advocate for the
access to abortion believe these ultrasound ser-
vices exist to convince women not to terminate
their pregnancies.
Proctor went on to clarify that Arbor Vitae
exists to empower women.
"We simply think having more information
before you make such a significant choice is real-
ly important," she said. "Being in a safe environ-
ment with qualified counselors and being able to
come to your own, mindful decision is empower-
ment."
The staff of nurses at the center are trained to
use the sonogram, and must have received medi-
cal training in order to be hired as volunteers.
However, the center is not allowed to refer its
patients for an abortion.
"We really do believe, as an organization, one
of the healthiest things you can do for a woman
who has a positive pregnancy test, is she can
carry a child to term," Proctor said. She added
that clinics that provide abortions have "excel-

lent market-
ing," and
Arbor Vitae
would never
change its
policies to
allow abor-
tion refer-
rals.
When
asked
whether
or not the
center
also offers
advice that
advocates
abortion
or takes a
stance in
the right-
to-choice
debate,
Proctor
was quick
to point out
that rhetoric
such as "debate" and "argument" doesn't enter
Arbor Vitae's office space.
"Every woman has her own journey, and poli-
tics has no place in it," Proctor said.
The abortion debate has been in the national
spotlight ever since the beginning of the 20th
century, coming to a boiling point near the
1960s. By the end of that decade, consensus
emerged that many of the health concerns asso-
ciated with the procedure were exaggerated. All
the while, the women's rights movement grew,
with the right to choice becoming a rallying
point for those who believed women should not
be bound by government regulation in questions
concerning their own bodies.
The landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme court deci-
sion in Roe v. Wade mandated that women, under
the protection of their due process rights, were
able to get an abortion under certain guidelines.
An added clause required that all abortion prac-
tices are balanced against the state's respon-
sibilities to protect the life of the baby and the
mother.
Activists who advocate against access and the
legality of abortion, often with the backing of
various religious organizations, saw the ruling
as an infringement upon the sanctity of human
life.
"It is in God's name that we must strive for-
ward to protect the lives of those too young to
protect their own," read a 1974 memo drafted
by Right to Life of Michigan - accessible at the
Bentley Library.
Proctor was quick to point out Arbor Vitae
doesn't endorse any religious or political agen-
das when offering counseling services to its
patients, stating that there is absolutely no reli-
gious context to the information they provide.
"It's about her. This is not a debate. It's not
political. It's about her," she said.'

"That's just not true," said Public Policy
junior Carly Manes, former president of the Uni-
versity's Students For Choice chapter, of Proc-
tor's claim.
Manes said that while there are around 2,000
abortion clinics in the nation, there are more
than 4,000 crisis pregnancy centers, like Arbor
Vitae. In many cases, these CPCs started with
religious backing and continue to staunchly
adhere to those religious beliefs.
"They market themselves as a place where
they have free services for women who are sexu-
ally active and who might be pregnant," Manes
said. "And yes, they have these free services and
they have pregnancy tests and ultrasound test-
ing, but the whole point is to get you in there to
convince you to not have an abortion."
Manes described how the pregnancy tests
used at the center are no different than ones
available at a local CVS. The staff of nurses at the
center are trained to use the sonogram, and have
to have received medical training in order to be
hired as volunteers - but there's a catch.
Though Proctor described how Arbor Vitae
strives hard to look past the "debate" raging
outside the doors of its office space, religion has
a history within the counseling center. On its
website, Arbor Vitae links to a story specifying
the struggles of a mother who faced pressure
from a doctor to carry out an abortion when the
procedure wasn't warranted.
Throughout the account, the author referenc-
es God and Christianity, including verses from
the Bible. Ultimately, the doctor in the story
informs the mother she will have to deal with a
lifetime of health complications if she decides to
go to term with the pregnancy.
The 1,000-something words show how both
religion and medicine have an influence on
women across America.
Arbor Vitae's dissociation with abortion can
be partly explainedby the makeup of its board of
directors. The two licensed doctors Arbor Vitae
has on its board, Dr. Phillip Fleming and Dr. Wil-
liam "Rusty"Chavey,both have many ties to reli-
gious and medical groups that oppose abortion.
The pair served on the board of directors of the

Catholic Medical Association, with Chavey run-
ning a call-in radio program called Vital Signs
where listeners could call in to discuss the sci-
ence surrounding the Catholic Church's position
on various medical practices including abortion.
"I think it's great they give out free pregnancy
tests and what not, but they're never really tell-
ing the women that they're a religious organiza-
tion," said Sydney Gallup, a recent LSA graduate
who was a former president of the University's
Students For Choice chapter and currently over-
sees interns for South-East Planned Parenthood.
From a historical perspective, the number of
abortions in Michigan has been dropping ever
since the introduction of the practice in the early
1970s. The year-to-year drop-off rate peaked in
the '80s, and continued to increase rapidly until
2000, before stabilizing around 23,000 abor-
tions per year. Though theories about why this
rapid fall occurred over this 20-year period are
widespread, the obvious answer is the increase
in quality and availability of contraceptive tech-
niques.
"There's no question about it - birth control
played a major role in the fall," said Ed Gold-
man, an associate professor in the Department
of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Within the OB/GYN Department, Goldman
oversees the program on sexual rights and
reproductive justice, and in May 2013, hosted
an interdisciplinary conference on international
reproductive rights.
Goldman believes birth control, which Arbor
Vitae does not provide access to, is the single
most important point of the reproductive rights
debate.
Around the early 1970s and '80s, doctors
started developing "morning-after" pills that
allowed women to avoid the risk of unwanted
pregnancy after unprotected sex. Usually, the
pill or "regimen" requires women to take small
doses of estrogen over the course of a few days
in order to delay ovulation.
Studies conducted overseas found these new

techniques - namely the Yuzpe regimen - to be
highly effective, but the FDA stalled approval.
The delays occurredbecause of pushback mainly
from advocates against the legalization of abor-
tion - factions that claimed using a morning-
after pill was equivalent to getting an abortion,
or in worst-case scenarios, the regimen could be
abused to harm pregnancies in their later stages.
In a 2012 study published in Obtetrics &
Gynecology and carried out near the St. Louis
metropolitan area, 9,000 women, ages ranging
between 15 and 45, were provided free birth con-
trol. Researchers then monitored the number of
women who chose to terminate their pregnan-
cies over the course of two years and saw a dras-
tic decrease in abortions inside the city. Nearby
Kansas City, where contraception wasn't hand-
ed out, showed no significant changes. Critics
of the study have suggested the free availabil-
ity of contraceptives can cause riskier sexual
behavior. In the long run, it may even lead to an
increase in unplanned pregnancies and abortion
because of access to the contraceptives the study
identifies as not very effective.
Despite numerous reports showing a clear
difference between morning-after pills and
ingestible abortion pills, many advocates against
access and legality of abortion still consider
emergency contraception to be a diluted or indi-
rect form of abortion.
Rather, the availability of regimens such as
Yuzpe, has been shown to reduce the need of
induced abortions in traditional clinics.
In the case of women who have already gotten
an abortion, Proctor said Arbor Vitae is willing
to provide free counseling services for women
struggling with after-effects. In fact, while
looking for volunteer counselors, Arbor Vitae
only hires candidates who self-identify as peo-
ple advocating for access and legality of abortion
- "pro-abortion to the degree that they would
have an opinion on the subject should a woman
walk through the door," Proctor said.
According to Proctor, people vehemently

against access to abortion would be unable
to provide proper guidance due to the risk of
patient interactions getting too political.
Goldman explained how, over the last few
decades, the proponents against the legality of
abortion have modified their stance to become
more effective in accomplishing their goals. He
noted how closely these modifications follow the
principles of economics.
"At first, they tried to work with the demand
side of the equation, adding mandatory wait-
ing periods before getting the abortion, forcing
patients to look at ultrasounds - a lot like what
Arbor Vitae does," Goldman said. "That didn't
work. The number of abortions didn't really
change because women still wanted them."
"So now, they're trying to pass new laws that
mess with the supply side," he continued. "Clin-
ics in Texas are closing because of these policies
that require them to be a certain size or be a cer-
tain distance from hospitals."
In Michigan, new policies - namely a bill
passed in 2014 - now require women to buy an
additional insurance rider to be protected from
the costs of abortion. The law, in many cases,
goes as far as to nullify already existing policies,
making it increasingly difficult for women in
poverty to get the services they need.
"It's the type of system that always sees the
poorest people suffering," Goldman said. "No
one looks after the women sleeping under bridg-
es."
Proctor emphasized that her role at Arbor
Vitae is to prioritize people through such coun-
seling, rather than external debate.
"It's a big topic in our culture ... this question
about abortion," she said. "Often, my questions
revolve around (focusing) on people. A lot of
people come through those doors. Each story is
different. Each woman is different. And as you
draw her out - and again, not every woman
- but there are some that need the support to
know their own strength."
