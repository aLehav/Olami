RESEARCH

According 
to 
Keith 

Soster, director of Student 
Engagement at Michigan 
Dining, 
Starbucks 
cups 

commonly 
used 
for 

coffee and tea specifically 
contaminate University of 
Michigan 
recycling 
bins 

most frequently.

Angela Porta, outreach 

and zero waste coordinator 
at Recycle Ann Arbor, said 
the city of Ann Arbor is not 
able to recycle these cups 
either, citing reasons such as 
food contamination and the 
wax lining to the cup.

“They are lined with 

an extremely thin layer of 
plastic that is tightly fused to 
the paper to prevent leaking 
and it is very difficult to 
separate that plastic from 
the paper,” she explained.

In 
addition 
to 
the 

46,002 
students 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

campus, there are 27,595 

faculty and staff working on 
campus as of Nov. 2017 and 
20,091 total hospital faculty 
and staff — creating the 
potential for the use of a lot 
of cups at UM. 

This 
total 
number 

of 
people, 
which 
can 

be likened to an almost 
full 
Michigan 
Stadium, 

includes 
students, 
staff 

and faculty who produce 
waste of all kinds every 
day. University efforts to 
control this waste have been 
part of an ongoing process 
as growing knowledge of 
its environmental impact 
continues.

The 
waste 
produced 

by students and faculty 
reflect the basic materials 
used daily, including paper, 
cardboard, plastic bottles, 
coffee 
cups 
and 
paper 

plates. The University has 
worked 
alongside 
local 

organizations to mitigate 
the 
negative 
effects 
of 

waste, 
partnering 
with 

the Western Washtenaw 
Recycling 
Authority, 

which 
operates 
between 

University 
of 
Michigan 

students 
and 
faculty 
are 

hopeful new mandated online 
sexual misconduct training 
for 
faculty 
will 
combat 

misconduct on campus, but 
are still skeptical of its overall 
efficacy.

University President Mark 

Schlissel announced the new 
requirements Sept. 20 as a 
part of the administration’s 
ongoing initiative to combat 
sexual misconduct.

According 
to 
University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald, 
the training will likely be 
rolled out this fall and will 
consist solely of an online 
course. Fitzgerald said the 
training 
remains 
under 

development and will likely 
be changed and refocused 
in the future in a manner 
similar to current student 
training. Schlissel reiterated 
this intention and said the 
training will be informed by 
the 
changing 
environment 

of sexual misconduct at the 
University 
in 
a 
previous 

interview.

“We’ve been working on 

how to continuously improve 
the safety and the inclusive 
campus 
climate,” 
Schlissel 

Ann Arbor City Council voted 

down an ordinance introduced by 
three councilmembers Monday 
night establishing a citizen-led 

police oversight 

board, 

instead 

voting to move forward with a 
counter-ordinance offered by 
Mayor Christopher Taylor.

More than 100 Ann Arbor 

residents attended the meeting 
at 
City 
Hall, 
which 
lasted 

past midnight. When the task 

force’s ordinance failed, the 

remaining 
audience 

members 
walked 

out, 
chanting, 

“Who do you 

protect? Who 

do 
you 

serve?” at 

councilmembers. Supporters of 
the task force’s proposal argued 
Taylor’s proposal was “watered 
down” and “toothless.”

Taylor said he proposed his 

ordinance to encapsulate the 
recommendations of the citizen 
task force while still complying 
with city and state law, as well 
as 
the 
police 
department’s 

collective bargaining agreement. 

“We need a commission that 

provides a place for people to 
come to express their concerns 
about policing in Ann Arbor 
… People have a right to be 
confident in policing,” Taylor 
said. “I proposed the ordinance 
because I want to form a strong, 
defensible policing commission 
that will affect public trust.”

Councilmembers 
Anne 

Bannister, 
D-Ward 
1, 
Jack 

Eaton, D-Ward 4, and Sumi 
Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 
1, 

introduced 
the 
ordinance 

written by members of a citizen 
task force. While Eaton and 
Bannister voted in favor of the 
mayor’s proposal “to get the 
ball rolling,” Kailasapathy was 
the only councilmember who 
voted against it, saying she was 
counting on the new incoming 

council members to support 
the task force’s version of the 
ordinance.

“I’m really upset with how 

this whole thing has changed 
direction,” Kailasapathy said. 

Councilmember Jane Lumm, 

I-Ward 2, voted against the task 
force’s ordinance and in favor of 
Taylor’s proposal. 

“Mayor’s 
version 
of 
the 

ordinance includes much of what 
was in the task force’s proposed 
ordinance but eliminates those 
provisions that are potentially 
problematic 
and 
in 
conflict 

with the city charter, collective 
bargaining 
agreements 
and 

operational practices,” Lumm 
said.

The 
task 
force 
was 

originally appointed to offer 
recommendations 
for 
the 

formation of a police oversight 
board. Taylor said while the body 
“did in fact do strong work,” he 
could not support the ordinance 
because he worried parts of it 
were not legally sound. 

Both proposals call for an 

11-member 
body 
appointed 

by 
City 
Council

review

100 residents rally in support of ordinance, but vote passes in favor of mayor’s bill

About 20 students, faculty 

and local activists convened 
on the University of Michigan 
Diag Monday afternoon for 
an anti-gun violence rally 
jointly hosted by Shattering 
the Silence, an organization 
dedicated to increased gun 
control measures, and the 
advocacy nonprofit NextGen 
America. The rally served to 
commemorate the 58 lives 
lost in Las Vegas a year ago — 
the deadliest mass shooting 
in American history — and 
urge 
people 
to 
demand 

stricter gun control policies. 

The rally signaled the 

beginning 
of 
a 
37-day 

campaign 
of 
activism 

and voter registration by 
NextGen 
leading 
up 
to 

the 
midterm 
elections. 

According 
to 
NextGen 

Field 
Organizer 
Hudson 

Villeneuve, the organization 
has already registered 35,000 

people in the state and hopes 
to increase that number even 
more before election day.

Similarly, 
the 

University joined the Big 
Ten Voting Challenge in 
September 2017 to try and 
register the most voters of 
all 14 schools in the Big Ten 
conference in the upcoming 
year. The results will be 
tallied after the midterm 
elections this November.

Student 
organizer 
Jen 

Chalom, a Northville High 
School junior, emphasized 
how imperative it is for 
younger generations to get 
involved in causes they care 
about. Chalom, who began 
organizing the rally in mid-
August after coordinating 
her school’s walkout the 
previous year, also stressed 
how 
registering 
people 

to vote should be one of 
the main objectives of the 
campaign.

“These are people who 

wouldn’t have voted if we 
didn’t come here,” Chalom 
said. “Because of something 

I did, someone will be going 
to the polls and voting. That 
just seems like a huge impact, 
even if I get five people 
registered to vote. Three 
percent of young people who 
can vote, do. That just seems 
crazy — you see all these 
problems 
and 
watch 
the 

news and hear about these 
things but no one seems to be 
doing anything about them.”

Chalom said she and other 

student 
activists 
reached 

out to organizations like 
Moms Demand Action to 
recruit speakers such as 
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., and Medical School 
student 
Solomon 
Rajput. 

Rajput highlighted how a 
lack of focus on statewide 
issues causes so few people 
to 
routinely 
call 
their 

representatives to demand 
change.

“People 
feel 
like 
the 

national stuff is sometimes 
more 
important, 
more 

worthy of their attention,” 
Rajput said. “But the state 
level 
stuff 
really, 
really 

makes a huge difference 
in terms of our lives in the 
state. Sometimes it’s hard 
for people to remember that. 
It’s definitely less sexy, and 
there’s less media attention, 
but it’s so important.”

LSA 
freshman 
Josie 

Graham 
said 
she 
was 

especially 
impressed 
by 

the 
high 
school 
student 

organizers 
of 
the 
rally 

who have inspired younger 
generations 
to 
pursue 

activism, even though many 
of them cannot yet vote. 
Graham said her experience 
attending 
a 
gun 
control 

walkout in high school left 
her empowered to support 
that kind of activism at the 
University.

“It 
gave 
students 
the 

ability to do something on 
a larger scale and gain the 
community’s attention and 
tell them how we feel because 
at that age we couldn’t vote 
yet,” Graham said. “It’s a 
way to express ourselves and 
finally have a voice that is 
amplified.”

“Our engineering colleagues 

across the country, including 
some colleagues of mine here 
at Michigan engineering, are 
being demeaned, victimized, 
hurt,” Gallimore said. “They’re 
being treated wickedly. I stand 
before you to say that that is 
unequivocally unacceptable.”

Psychology Professor Lilia 

Cortina, 
associate 
director 

of the ADVANCE Program, 

followed 
Gallimore’s 

statement with the highlights 
of the National Academies 
of Science, Engineering and 
Medicine report on sexual 
harassment. 
Cortina, 
who 

worked on the report, outlined 
the three main types of sexual 
harassment: sexual coercion, 
unwanted 
sexual 
attention 

and 
gender 
harassment. 

The report argues Title IX 
legislation has done little to 
reduce 
the 
incidence 
rate 

of 
sexual 
harassment 
in 

academia. 

Cortina’s research reports 

63 
percent 
of 
women 
in 

academia 
had 
experienced 

some 
type 
of 
sexual 

harassment. 
Additionally, 

she found that one in five 
sexually 
harassed 
women 

meet criteria for depressive 
disorders and one in 10 meet 
criteria for PTSD. Cortina said 
dozens of studies have shown 
sexual 
harassment 
derails 

victims 
professional 
lives 

disengage from their work, 
and sometimes they leave 
their institutions or the field 

entirely.

“There is no evidence 

that 
current 
policies, 

procedures, 
and 

approaches 
— 
which 

often focus on symbolic 
compliance with the law 
and on avoiding liability 
— have resulted in a 
significant reduction in 
sexual harassment,” the 
report reads. 

Cortina noted sexual 

coercion is the most 
widely publicized form 
of harassment, and the 
type 
of 
misconduct 

addressed 
by 
the 

most 
legislation. 
She 

maintained, 
however, 

gender harassment was 
by far the most common 
and pressing form.

“More often than not, 

sexual harassment is a 
put down, not a come 
on,” Cortina said. “So 
the bulk of the iceberg 
is gender harassment, 
and this is conduct that 
demeans, 
denigrates, 

humiliates people based 
on gender.”

Cortina stressed that even 

when 
sexual 
harassment 

contains nothing but sexist 
insults, with no unwanted 
sexual attention, it takes a toll 
on victims. For this reason, 
Cortina says, a lot of the 
regulations in place targeting 
sex do not help the issue.

“Gender 
harassment 
is 

less about sex and more 
about contempt, so rules and 
regulations policing sex are 
not a solution here,” Cortina 
said. 
“When 
women 
are 

sexually 
harassed, 
women 

leave, their coworkers leave 
— even the men leave. They 
don’t stick around to watch 
their valued colleagues be 
disparaged, and they certainly 
don’t want to be the next 
victims.”

Panelists 
were 
later 

asked what they found most 
surprising about the findings. 
Allison 
Steiner, 
associate 

professor in Department of 
Climate and Space Sciences 
and 
Engineering 
and 
one 

of the panelists, responded 
that her only surprise was 
the number of women who 
reported having been sexually 
harassed.

“I was surprised that the 

harassment numbers were as 
low as they are,” Steiner said. 
“I expected them to be like, 90 
percent.”

Panelist 
Gilda 
Barabino, 

dean of the Grove School 
of Engineering at The City 
College of New York, said 
while she was not shocked 
by the results of the report, 
she was pleasantly surprised

the 
conduct 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

police officers and investigate 
complaints from city residents, 
but concerns arose about the 
legality of certain provisions in 
relation to the city charter and 
the police department’s collective 
bargaining agreement. 

Kailasapathy, 
who 

co-sponsored the task force’s 
ordinance, 
said 
the 
process 

surrounding the formation of 
citizen task force’s proposal 
was the most democratic she 
had seen in her six years on City 
Council.

“I’m really proud to bring 

this up because this is yours,” 
Kailasapathy said to supporters 
in attendance Monday evening. 
“It’s what the residents have 
told us,” adding the ordinance 
was “not anti-police,” but rather 
“pro-safety.”

While the mayor’s proposal 

and the task force’s ordinance 
both preserved anonymity for 
complainants and clarified that 
no city councilmember or active 
duty police officer will sit on 
the oversight board, Taylor’s 
differed 
in 
its 
appointment 

of 
independent 
counsel 
and 

provisions regarding concurrent 
investigations 
by 
the 
board 

and 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 

Department. 

The mayor’s proposal diverged 

from the vision of the citizen task 
force in giving the mayor more 
power 
over 
the 
appointment 

process as well. In Taylor’s version, 
the mayor would be responsible 
for appointing members to the 

oversight board, while the citizen 
task force proposed the oversight 
board itself and the Human 
Rights 
Commission 
should 

create a list of possible members 
that would be appointed by City 
Council. 

While the citizen task force 

sought to award the oversight 
board subpoena power, a memo 
from City Attorney Stephen 
K. Postema noted “significant 
legal issues with subpoenaing 
residents 
of 
the 
City, 
City 

employees, or police officers” 
because the city charter does 
not grant City Council subpoena 
power. 
Postema 
maintained 

Council’s 
lack 
of 
subpoena 

power implies its power to the 
commission is questionable. 

Additionally, 
Postema’s 

memo cast doubt on the the 
commission’s ability to retain 
independent counsel, an issue 
that led to worries of conflicts 
of interest during the September 
work session. The memo stated 
a commission created by City 
Council “has no authority to 
contract 
with 
outside 
legal 

counsel on its own.”

The Police Officers Association 

of Michigan sent a letter to 
Taylor opposing the citizen task 
force’s ordinance, calling the 
“blatant lack of trust” for the 
AAPD “unconscionable.” POAM 
did so in an effort to “protect 
Ann Arbor police officers from 
the venom which this proposed 
ordinance spews,” saying, “The 
proposed ordinance lacks moral 
justification 
and 
lacks 
legal 

authority.” 

The 
ordinance 
introduced 

by Taylor will move forward 
to a second reading at the City 
Council meeting on Oct. 15. 

five municipalities and sorts 
through the trash generated by 
the University.

According 
to 
Tracy 

Artley, waste reduction and 
recycling program manager 
for the Office of Campus 
Sustainability, 
recycling 
on 

the 
institutional 
level 
has 

had increased standards and 
thus requires education and 
consistency.

“Manufacturers 
have 
a 

lower and lower tolerance 
for contamination — for non-
recyclables ending up in there,” 
Artley said. “That’s a cost to 
them, they have to sort those 
out, and if they missed it, it 
could ruin the whole batch 
of 
what 
they’re 
recycling. 

Unfortunately, some people 
do what we call wish-cycling, 
where they put things in the 
recycling 
bin 
hoping 
that 

because they put it there, it’ll 
get recycled.”

Because of the University’s 

close 
relationship 
with 
WWRA, 

consistent 
communication 

allows the Office of Campus 
Sustainability to be notified if 
a batch is contaminated, and 
they can subsequently trace the 
bin back to a certain building 
or department. This way, the 
office is able to directly address 
consistent recycling errors at 
certain buildings.

Artley 
also 
explained 

how economic factors weigh 
heavily on the lack of recycling 
for paper products, especially 
coffee cups.

“Recycling is this great 

environmental effort, but at 
heart, it’s an economic effort,” 
she said. “When we recycle 
things, they get sorted out and 
set out for recycling. They are 
being recycled for purchasing 
by a manufacturer who wants 
to make something new out of 
that. With coffee cups, there’s 
no company, at least around 
the state, that wants these 
paper coffee cups.”

said 
earlier 
in 
September. 

“We’re continuing to study 
our current procedures … The 
idea is to continuously improve 
in this really important area, 
so there will be more to come 
in the months ahead on what 
we can do to diminish the 
frequency of misconduct on 
our campus.”

The training was born out of 

the Working Group on Faculty 
and Staff Sexual Misconduct, a 
committee which investigated 
current 
University 
policy 

and published findings. The 
committee 
was 
co-chaired 

by 
Laurita 
Thomas, 

associate 
vice 
president 

for 
Human 
Resources, 

and former U-M Dearborn 
Chancellor 
Daniel 
Little. 

The 
committee’s 
published 

recommendations 
included 

mandatory 
faculty 

programming, as the University 
previously required only newly 
hired staff to undergo such 

training. Proposed modules 
in the training include topics 
of institutional commitment, 
principles 
and 
values 
and 

behavior expectations. 

The 
University’s 
annual 

sexual 
misconduct 

report released in September 
reported 
data 
from 
only 

student 
misconduct 
filings. 

An 
independent 
crowd-

sourced database of sexual 
misconduct 
in 
academia, 

however, called the “whisper 
network” attracted attention 
last winter with a log of more 
than a dozen incidents of 
sexual assault, harassment and 
rape perpetrated by University 
faculty members. 

American Culture Professor 

Lisa 
Nakamura 
welcomed 

the 
trainings, 
predicting 

they would certainly raise 
awareness 
of 
protocols 

among faculty, but expressed 
reservations about the long-
term efficacy of the online 
course.

SHAT TERING THE SILENCE

finding funding for humanities 
research is generally difficult, 
especially 
from 
sources 
not 

associated with the University. 
Noting 
a 
funding 
disparity 

between humanities and natural 
science 
research, 
Crisostomo 

said he’s found the most success 
receiving grants for humanities 
projects 
with 
computational 

aspects, like his contributions to 
an online database of translated 
texts.

“The digital humanities almost 

is a way of making the humanities 
seem more scientific,” Crisostomo 
said. “Funding bodies are looking 
more at these projects rather than 
what have been the traditional 
humanities 
projects, 
such 
as 

translations of texts or analyses of 
texts or people groups, things like 
that.”

According to the University’s 

2017 Annual Report on Research, 
the 
majority 
of 
research 

expenditures 
go 
toward 

projects in the natural sciences 
and 
technology. 
The 
School 

of Medicine topped research 
expenditures last year, taking 
up 41 percent of all research 
costs, followed by the College of 
Engineering at 17 percent. Only 13 
percent of research expenditures 
were attributed to LSA, the 
largest college by population at the 
University.

Several key sources of income 

fund research at the University. Of 
the $1.48 billion spent on research 
in 2017, 56 percent was funded by 
the federal government, mostly 
in the form of grants provided by 
agencies such as National Institute 

of Health and NASA. Funds from 
non-federal 
sources, 
such 
as 

industry sponsors, comprised 11 
percent of research expenditures. 
Internal funds, generated by 
tuition, gifts and state support, 
made up 33 percent.

Sara Blair, vice provost for 

Academic and Faculty Affairs, 
said though University faculty 
have been successful in earning 
humanities 
research 
awards 

relative to other universities, 
external 
funding 
for 
the 

humanities is generally limited.

“One really important fact 

about funding for research in 
the humanities and humanistic 
social sciences, more broadly, 
is that the amount of funding 
available externally is regrettably 
minimal,” Blair said. “Especially 
compared with other disciplinary 
areas, there just are not robust 
opportunities for faculty to apply, 
particularly 
for 
longer-term, 

larger-scale research projects.”

Heather Offhaus, director of 

Grant Review and Analysis for the 
Medical School Office of Research, 
noted there is some practical basis 
for the funding disparity. She 
said one reason medical research 
dominates total expenditures at 
the University is the school’s large 
faculty size, leading to a higher 
volume of research.

“The schools and colleges 

are 
arranged 
by 
where 

faculty are employed and tenured, 
and we have a very large engine,” 
Offhaus said. “The three largest 
schools on campus are the Medical 
School, Engineering and LSA.”

Offhaus 
added 
scientific 

research is often more costly than 
research in the humanities or arts, 
thus requiring larger grants.

“Compared to LSA, medical 

research is far more expensive, 
and so we’re applying to sponsors 
that are prepared to cover the cost 
of the research or part of the cost 
of the research and so those tend 
to be larger awards than, say, in 
LSA,” Offhaus said. “Engineering 
is a little more like we are in terms 
of size and scope of awards.”

Though 
Crisostomo 

acknowledged 
science 
and 

technology 
research 
can 
be 

costlier in terms of personnel and 
equipment, he also attributed 
the funding gap to a lack of 
appreciation for the humanities. 
According to Crisostomo, the 
humanities are often seen as 
purely academic, luxury fields 
of study, whereas the natural 
sciences are considered to have 
more realistic applicability.

“There is a tendency for 

the 
natural 
sciences 
to 
be 

more easily understandable as 
somewhat 
practical 
research,” 

Crisostomo said. “You think about 
the projects at U of M such as 
automated driving that led to a lot 
of attention, and you see how that’s 
practical outside of academia.”

Crisostomo said he strongly 

believes in the value of humanities 
research, 
because 
it 
builds 

empathy and promotes the careful 
consumption of media. He added 
humanities scholars, especially 
those who study the past, are able 
to piece together fragmentary 
information to better understand 
historical events, a skill that 
translates to modern politics 
and global issues. In applying for 
grants from funding agencies, 
Crisostomo 
said, 
humanities 

researchers must make a strong 
case for the validity and value of 
their work.

“We have to make the case, 

whereas 
for 
some 
natural 

sciences it’s more assumed, it’s a 
default thing that they’re really 
applicable,” 
Crisostomo 
said. 

“It’s not as obvious a case for the 
humanities.”

In 
spite 
of 
his 
difficulty 

finding 
external 
funding, 

Crisostomo said he has noticed 
the University’s efforts to direct 
more internal funds toward the 
humanities.

“One of the good things that 

I’ve seen here at the U of M 
is recently there has been more of a 
push for getting some humanities 
funding,” Crisostomo said. “For 
example, I know that the college 
of LSA has increased the amount 
for the startup package, that is 
the amount of money given to 
incoming professors to get their 
projects going, and that includes 
the humanities, that includes 
social sciences.”

Amy Dittmar, vice provost 

for Academic and Budgetary 
Affairs, said the University tries to 
compensate for the lack of external 
funding by supporting humanities 
research with internal funds, such 
as initiatives like the Institute for 
the Humanities and Humanities 
Collaboratory. 
In 
2017, 
the 

humanities, 
arts 
and 
social 

sciences received a combined 
56 percent of grants and awards 
distributed by the Office of 
Research.

“We really are mindful in 

making sure that there are 
available resources for all of our 
faculty to do research, and some 
of those areas naturally have 
external funding and some of 

with the response of the 
community.

Barabino 
and 
Cortina 

discussed 
how 
women 

and 
members 
of 
other 

underrepresented 
groups 

have to brush off instances 
of gender harassment.

“You may brush it off, 

say that was just today,” 
Barabino said. “Well, it was 
today, it was yesterday, it’s 
coming tomorrow, and it 
doesn’t get seen.”

University administrators 

are currently working to 
reduce 
harassment 
and 

misconduct among faculty. 
As of last month, faculty 
members will be required to 
undergo sexual misconduct 
training 
following 

reccomendations from a staff 
and faculty working group. 
While 
the 
University’s 

student sexual misconuduct 
policy is subject to regular 

reviews 
and 
revisions, 

similar guidelines do not 
exist 
for 
the 
Standard 

Practice Guide that governs 
faculty and staff misconduct. 

In 
response 
to 
a 

question asking how it is 
possible to survey sexual 
harassment, 
Cortina 
said 

because of this issue, they 
do 
not 
ask 
respondents 

point blank whether they 
have 
experienced 
sexual 

harassment or not.

“When we survey people, 

we try to avoid all these 
terms entirely,” Cortina said. 
“We ask about specifically 
defined behaviors because 
people have such different 
understandings 
for 
what 

sexual harassment means, 
what it means to be sexually 
harassed. And oftentimes 
what you actually find is that 
people will say yes to a whole 
list of behaviors, and all these 
behaviors are examples of 
sexual harassment conduct.

“F

irst 
impressions 
last a lifetime.”
“Go confidently in 
the direction of your dreams.”
These are the words of wisdom 
that led me toward my greatest 
adventure in medical school — an 
international rotation in Ghana. 
Pursuing my dream in another 
country created memories that 
will last a lifetime and inform who 
I am as a physician.
First Day in the Labor Ward
As I entered the labor ward at 
Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, 
I discovered a large room divided by 
thick concrete walls. Each section 
contained pleather beds covered in 
plastic tarps that patients brought 
from home. I found myself fascinated 
by the lack of equipment. There were 
no IV poles. The background noise 
was free of the familiar beeping 
monitors and inflating blood pressure 
cuffs. You would not find a large TV 
displaying continuous fetal heart 
tracings, but on each dividing wall, you 
would find a Pinard horn, a funnel-
shaped instrument used to manually 
count fetal heartbeats. Intermittently, 
I would observe Ghanaian medical 
students place their hands on mothers’ 
abdomens to count the number and 
duration of contractions in a 10-minute 
period. The results would be entered 
into a pantograph, a paper chart that 
is used to track labor progression. 
Even without the lines and monitors, 
it was incredible to witness the level of 
medical care being provided within a 
limited resource setting.
As I continued my observations, I 
discovered that all patients go through 
“natural births,” predominantly due to 
the cost of epidurals. One might expect 
the ward to be filled with yelling 
and laboring mothers crying out in 
pain, yet it was surprisingly quiet. No 
one called out and no one screamed. 
Instead, I was surrounded by women 
snapping their fingers, praying and 
humming through contractions.
As I followed a mother’s progress 
through labor, I was taken aback 
by her final delivery process. In 
the “second stage” area, there is no 
coaching, privacy or family members, 
just the mother, her midwife and 
any medical students who decided 
to observe the delivery. Though it 
was her first child, the mother was 

not coached through her delivery. 
If she did not push adequately, the 
midwife would hiss in disgust. During 
the delivery, the midwife made an 
episiotomy, a surgical cut at the base 
of her vagina to aid in the delivery, but 
the patient, unfortunately, sustained a 
second-degree tear. While repairing 
the laceration, the patient would 
pull away due to pain. Each time the 
patient moved, the midwife would 
express her anger and displeasure. 
I struggled to watch as the patient 
writhed in pain. I desperately wanted 
to console her, but it did not feel like it 
was my place. With each unwanted 
movement by the patient, the tension 
in the room built. The midwife grew 
tired and at times, even pretended 
to give up on completing the repair 
entirely. Seconds felt like hours as the 
midwife worked to close the laceration 
and reunite the mother and her baby.
First Day as First Assist
“Can I scrub on your C-section 
case?”
“Yes, of course.”
The excitement that overcame me 
was palpable, as the idea of being first 
assist was merely a dream that I had 
prior to visiting Ghana. The resident 
took me through the scrubbing 
process, which entailed the typical 
personal 
protective 
equipment, 
rubber boots and a shin-length rubber 
apron worn over our surgical scrubs. 
We then scrubbed with pieces of pink 
soap left in a dish in the scrub room. 
As the foam collected on my hands, I 
found myself reviewing the steps of 
the operation, the patient’s medical 
history and any complications she was 
at risk for perioperatively.
As we entered the operating 
room, my heart began to race with 
anticipation. I gowned and gloved 
myself and then assisted with draping. 
We then made the first incision of 
the elective C-section for a fetus with 
a genetic disorder of bone growth 
called achondroplasia. When the baby 
delivered, his appearance was typical 
of achondroplasia: frontal bossing 
and shortened upper extremities. The 
baby was carefully placed on a nearby 
table, and then the surgeon’s technique 
took center stage. He prided himself 
on minimal tissue manipulation, 
leaving the uterus inside the abdomen 
during the repair and abstaining 
from exploring the uterine cavity for 

placental remains. We finished the 
operation and the only evidence of 
our presence was a small, beautifully 
closed pfannenstiel incision.
First Day Eating Ghanaian Fufu
“Are you free for dinner? We are 
going to try fufu.”
As a first-generation Nigerian 
American, I have consumed plenty of 
fufu in my life, including the batches 
that I personally struggled to prepare. 
Ignoring my familiarity with the 
dish, I enthusiastically accepted the 
invitation. My mind drifted over the 
possible variations of Ghanaian fufu. 
Would it be made of potato, yam or 
even plantain? Would it be hard or 
soft? Sour or neutral? Though fufu, 
a staple in Nigerian and Ghanaian 
cuisine, is essentially pounded starch 
and water, it can be made in numerous 
ways. I was excited to try this twist on 
a familiar dish.
We left the medical campus and 
began our journey to a restaurant 
called 
Confidence. 
When 
we 
arrived, we each ordered the fufu 
with groundnut soup and goat 
meat, a standard in Ghanaian 
cuisine. Within minutes, the server 
placed multiple large bowls of water 
and soap on the table and instructed 
us to wash our hands. The act 
heightened the experience, as I felt 
like a native Ghanaian eating in the 
proper way. The food came shortly 
thereafter, and as the bowl was 
placed in front of me I appreciated 
the nutty brown color and aroma of 
peppers and spices. Immediately, I 
reached into the bowl with my right 
hand to fish out a piece of the fufu 
ball floating in my soap. I flattened 
the fufu between my fingers while 
simultaneously scooping up the 
soup, and then lifting it to my 
mouth. The flavors were bold, yet 
balanced; new, yet familiar; and 
most importantly, delicious.
For 
any 
student 
traveling 
abroad, I encourage you to embrace 
the unfamiliar. If you challenge 
yourself to let down your guard and 
experience life in an open, curious 
and engaged manner, you will be 
rewarded with first impressions 
that last a lifetime.

Believe survivors?
I 

am a woman. I am a survivor 
of sexual assault, but I don’t 
want you to simply “believe 
me” because I wrote this. Why? 
Because I believe in due process. 
I believe in “innocent until proven 
guilty.” I believe the principles of 
the American judicial system are 
ones rooted in justice.
I know that the system has flaws 
and corruption has overtaken 
parts of it. It is hard to come out 
about sexual assault for many 
reasons. Corruption within the 
system often ends up protecting 
the 
powerful. 
However, 
just 
because we know this is true, it 
does not give us the right to label 
someone “corrupt” or “guilty” 
without the evidence to support it.
It is brave to come forward. I 
didn’t come forward. In fact, what 
nearly held me back from writing 
this piece at all was the fact that I 
would have to tell my parents what 
happened to me all those years 
ago. The knowledge of how much 
it would hurt them was almost too 
much to bear. Up until now, only 
a handful of people knew what 
happened to me five years ago 
when I was just a junior in high 
school. In the days, weeks, months 
and even years after the incident, 
what kept me from talking to most 
people was a mix of complicated 
emotions: embarrassment, fear 
and an overwhelming desire to 
put the whole thing behind me. 
If I had gone to my parents, they 
would have wanted me to go to 
the police. If I had gone to the 
police, they would have opened an 
investigation. If an investigation 
was opened, one thing would 
have become abundantly clear: 
There was no evidence. It was just 
me and him in a dark room, with 
one other person who happened 
to be asleep. I woke up and he 
was touching me, but he didn’t 
rape me, so I would have no DNA 
evidence. He didn’t bruise me, so 
there would be no marks on my 
body. There were no witnesses, 
just my word against his, and I 
know that for good reason the 
justice system does not allow 
people to be convicted on hearsay.
It is sad. It is sad that I 
discovered 
that 
this 
person 
committed almost exactly the 
same 
crime 
against 
another 

friend of mine some time before 
this incident had happened to 
me. I wasn’t his first victim, and 
the sickening truth is that I will 
more than likely also not be his 
last. Yet the truth is that my word 
alone is not, and should not, be 
enough to convict him. It doesn’t 
matter what the statistics are 
on accusations of sexual assault. 
Studies quoted in Vox, the BBC 
and Vogue have already reported 
that most people who come forth 
with sexual assault accusations 
are not lying. Whether these 
studies are accurate or not, I do 
not know. However, I do know 
that it truly doesn’t matter.
As Voltaire once said, Sir 
William Blackstone echoed and 
Benjamin Franklin later co-opted: 
“it is better 100 guilty Persons 
should escape than that one 
innocent Person should suffer,” 
is a maxim that has been long 
and generally approved. I still 
believe in this maxim and I think 
that, as Americans, we all should. 
This maxim is a protection. It 
guarantees that someone who 
would seek to destroy your life on 
baseless accusations, due to some 
personal vendetta, or a desire 
to harm you for one reason or 
another cannot do that without 
creating some sort of elaborate 
plot that frames you as “guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt.”
The truth is that tomorrow I 
could come out with a baseless 
claim against anybody, an old 
enemy, a bad professor or a former 
bully, but I am deterred from doing 
so by the fact that my baseless 
claim can do no more than hurt 
their reputation. What I fear is 
that, in this new world, where the 
push by the left is to unequivocally 
believe the accuser, this deterrence 
will exist no more. If we start 
punishing the potentially innocent 
based on nothing but accusations 
alone, then it encourages those 
who may seek to destroy someone 
else’s life to take that avenue. In the 
world of politics, the corrupt work 
by trying to ruin the lives of their 
opponents. If we don’t want the 
corrupt to win, then we can’t give 
them the chance to turn allegations 
into guilty verdicts, because that is 
exactly what they want.
Due to what I have gone 

through, it is not lost on me 
that this does and will continue 
to lead to some of the guilty 
going free. It is also not lost on 
me that there is still a culture 
of mistrust and blatant sexism 
toward women, one that has 
enabled sexual abuse to continue 
running rampant in our society 
for far too long. Because of my 
own circumstances, I am very 
likely to believe the accuser in a 
sexual violence case, and more 
than anything I want our justice 
system to punish rape crimes 
more harshly. It is a disgusting 
injustice that someone like Brock 
Turner, the guilty party in the 
infamous rape case at Stanford 
University, only spent three 
months in prison for his heinous 
crime because the judge actually 
cared that his life had been 
forever changed, as his parents 
and lawyers argued in court. His 
life should have been ruined. He 
didn’t and, in my opinion, still 
doesn’t deserve to walk free.
It physically pains me to 
think that my abuser walks 
free and that there is nothing 
even the justice system is able 
to do about it, but I know if 
my word alone could have 
convicted him that would 
have been a very dangerous 
power. I don’t want that power 
in my hands or in the hands of 
anyone else. I would rather 
see my accuser go free, even 
as tears come to my eyes as I 
write this, than to know that 
the power to ruin someone’s 
life based on an accusation 
alone has become a reality in 
the American justice system.
So, I ask us all to think about 
what we should truly believe 
in. I believe in justice. I believe 
in due process. I believe in 
evidence and “guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt,” but I don’t 
simply “believe survivors.” It 
hurts to say that because I am 
one, and most people who say 
they are a survivor are telling 
the truth, but regardless, you 
shouldn’t believe me based on 
my word alone.

First impressions

How Trump’s got it wrong on trade

KIKI OGU | WOLVERINES ABROAD

W

ith 
the 
U.S.-
China 
trade 
war 
and 
the 
sanctions 
on Iran and Russia dominating 
much of the news these days, 
U.S. trade policy has become 
the spark of much controversial 
debate. To me, this didn’t make 
much sense. Any Economics 101 
professor would have told you in 
the first week of class that trade 
benefits all. But when I looked 
into it, it seemed that there was 
a consensus among some of the 
world’s highest-ranked officials 
that free trade was not equal to 
fair trade. And so, in order to 
figure out the truth behind all of 
this, I decided to interview one of 
our own experts in international 
trade: Alan Deardorff, University 
of Michigan’s John W. Sweetland 
Professor 
of 
International 
Economics and Public Policy.
When it came to the definition 
of free trade, the answer was 
pretty obvious: in Deardorff’s 
words, 
“eliminating 
barriers 
such 
that 
trade 
could 
flow 
freely.” But fair trade was much 
more 
ambiguous. 
The 
term 
had begun to be used freely “to 
mean any trade (an individual) 
didn’t like.” For example, when a 
country subsidizes one industry 
over 
another, 
the 
industry’s 
competitors would view the 
trade as largely unfair. But if, 
say, China, decided to subsidize 
their exports, the U.S. consumer 
population would benefit, as 
“we’d get cheap stuff.” Similarly, 
if a company were to outsource 
manufacturing 
to 
a 
country 
where labor and input costs were 
cheaper, it could also be viewed 
as unfair by domestic suppliers. 
But, the real question is, if these 
allegations of unfairness were 
addressed, would trade become 
more efficient and less “unfair?” 
According to Deardorff, “that 
kind of unfair trade benefits us. 
Our country overall (would) be 
better off if we freely import from 
countries that want to sell to us, 
regardless of what determined 
the prices that they’re offering.”

That said, there is, in fact, a 
legal definition of unfair trade. 
Economic dumping occurs when 
a country exports for a price that 
is lower than the selling price 
locally. Now, this is controlled 
by laws that allow a country 
to put tariffs that would offset 
the price gap that dumping 
creates. But, that said, these 
anti-dumping duties are not 
often used by the U.S. except for 
specific cases in industries such 
as steel. Evidently, this “type” of 
unfair trade is obviously not what 
President Trump is talking about.
Rather, 
the 
current 
administration 
has 
been 
fixated on the tariffs that China 
has imposed on us, calling 
their acts of protectionism 
completely unfair and harmful 
to the U.S. Tariffs traditionally 
have 
two 
effects. 
One, 
they “raise the price to the 
(country’s) buyers,” and two, 
they “lower the price to the 
(country’s) sellers.” As long as 
the country is small, the effect 
of a tariff is localized and there 
is no change in the world price. 
However, “when a country 
becomes very large, there is the 
possibility of pushing down the 
exporter’s price.” According 
to studies done by Deardorff, 
though, “there is no country 
(not even the United States) 
that has enough share of the 
world economy (to significantly 
affect the world price).”
That said, tariffs instituted 
by countries like China do 
have the potential to affect 
U.S. producers. But, the extent 
to which our producers versus 
China’s consumers are getting 
hurt by a tariff is mixed. 
Obviously, U.S. producers will 
lobby for subsidies regardless, 
as it is in their political 
interest to do so. One popular 
case of this recently is the 
soybean industry.
With 
that 
in 
mind, 
our 
administration’s 
reaction 
in 
putting our own tariffs in place 
to combat the “inequity” created 

by the Chinese tariffs have doubly 
hurt our consumers. In fact, 
when I asked Deardorff about 
this, he said that there actually 
is a proper response to countries 
that 
have 
overstepped 
their 
boundaries by implementing high 
tariffs in filing a complaint with 
the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO would investigate the 
measure and determine whether 
the tariff is justified or not. In a 
perfect world, the United States 
should have paused, evaluated 
the conflict with China and filed 
an appropriate complaint. Rather, 
we hastily implemented tariffs 
which resulted in an escalation 
of the conflict, throwing us into 
a trade war. Neither country is 
really justified in their actions, 
and now the international trade 
scene has been turned upside 
down.
Trump seems to think that 
our trade deficit with China is 
the main cause of our conflict. 
However, trade deficits by nature 
are just a means of a company 
dealing 
with 
specialization. 
When a country buys more 
than it sells, it’s simply a matter 
of specialization and relative 
comparative advantage. Though 
trade deficits are not ideal in that 
we really should be producing for 
ourselves, there is no wrongdoing 
of China’s that is causing the 
imbalance and, according to 
economist Joseph Gagnon, “there 
is no evidence that high tariffs 
reduce (trade deficits).” 
The U.S. has unequivocally 
got it wrong on trade. We 
are sacrificing free trade in 
the name of protectionist 
policies that are isolating 
our country from the rest 
of the world and creating 
major political and economic 
harm. It doesn’t align with 
Democratic 
or 
Republican 
policy. It’s just plain wrong.

Seated in an upholstered 
booth 
surrounded 
by 
a 
sparkling jewel toned interior 
and lit with a warm, bright 
glow, Sava’s Ann Arbor has 
everything a millennial foodie 
needs for the perfect Instagram 
picture — the trendy, boho 
ambiance pairs perfectly with 
their token Sweety Fries, of 
course.
When Sava’s first opened 
its doors to the Ann Arbor 
community, 
they 
weren’t 
located 
in 
the 
large, 
aesthetically designed sweet 
spot on State Street, where they 
are now. They were actually 
right across the street in a 
modest 23 seat café which they 
were pushed out of due to the 
opening of State Street CVS. 
Since its humble beginnings, 
Sava Farah (restaurant owner) 
has 
transformed 
Sava’s 
into one of Ann Arbor’s hot 
spots — taking that small, 
quaint café and creating a 
full service, 300 seat dining 
experience. Sava’s has gone on 
to become, indisputably, one 
of Ann Arbor’s most popular 
restaurants.
The restaurant now serves 
over 800 guests on any given 
Sunday for brunch, says general 
manager Melanie Brown, who 
has been a part of the Sava’s 
family for seven years. Brown 
is part of the reason the place 
seems to have so much heart — 
her commitment to being set 
up for success every day is both 
admirable and inspiring.
“I come in and open Sava’s 
and my main motive is that 
we are set up for success. 
Everything from the music, to 
the lights, to the atmosphere. 
I just want to make sure all 
of the guests have the best 
experience possible,” she said, 
when asked about her typical 
day. It seems that hospitality is 
at the core of so much of Sava’s 
culture, which is what sets the 
standard of such a tremendous 
experience every time you 
walk through the front doors.
My experiences in Sava’s 
over the past two and a half 
years have been nothing short 
of 
exceptional. 
Everything 
from its diverse menu options 
to trendy atmosphere has made 
my wide array of brunch dates, 
birthday 
celebrations 
and 
meals with visitors from out 
of town special and delicious. 
I am a firm believer that you 
can’t find better sweet potato 
fries anywhere you look in Ann 
Arbor, which is a testament 
to the “Sweety” sauce I’m 
not ashamed to admit that I’d 
willingly drink.
Ann Arbor has a diverse and 
intriguing 
restaurant 
scene 
— with over 300 restaurants 
dotting its streets and filling 
the hearts and stomachs of 
University students, professors, 
tourists and townspeople alike. 
But something about Sava’s 
puts it above the rest — it is 
always packed with customers, 
whether it’s a Sunday morning, 
a Friday night or a Wednesday 
afternoon at 2:00 p.m. I was 
curious about just what makes 
Sava’s so irresistible.

“I think the location really 
helps, but the diverse menu 
options really makes Sava’s 
appealing to all walks of life. 
Sava’s has everything,” Brown 
answered, 
before 
Adrienne 
Brady, marketing and media 
coordinator chimed in: “And 
our Insta game, of course. We 
really know our audience.” 
I couldn’t think of a better 
person than Brady to be in 
charge of coordinating the 
social media and marketing 
for all of the SavCo Hospitality 

locations, including Sava’s and 
Aventura. She is bright and 
bubbly, astute and curious.
Sava’s is a known hot spot 
for 
all 
occasions 
— 
from 
casual lunches with friends, 
to important dinners, to the 
idiosyncratic Sunday brunch 
buffet, they never seem to miss 
a beat.
“We started the Sunday 
brunch 
buffet 
because 
on 
Sunday we’re so busy that 
the kitchen couldn’t keep up. 
The chefs create a variety of 
amazing options every week, 
and the brunch has become 
so popular it’s more busy 
than Sunday nights,” Brown 
said when asked about the 
brunch 
phenomenon 
that 
Sava’s masters so well. I would 
venture to say that if I only ate 
the chicken sausage for the 
rest of my life, I’d be more than 
happy.
“Our 
audience 
is 
the 
students, 
and 
we 
market 
to them,” Brady added to 
emphasize 
the 
University 
brunch habit that Sava’s helps 
people to indulge in.
Whenever I go to Sava’s, I 

have my favorite dishes on the 
menu that I can’t resist. It’s 
really something special and 
alluring that the menu is able 
to tackle so many options, so 
much so that it is impossible to 
dislike Sava’s. I usually opt for 
the Hippie Bowl — a delicious 
variety of fresh vegetables 
and grilled tempeh tossed in a 
tangy lemon-tahini dressing. 
The 
Mediterranean 
salmon 
bowl is also one of my go-tos 
— the mushroom medley and 
roasted pearl onions it is served 
with are to die for.
I was curious about finding 
out which of their iconic menu 
items sell best, considering the 
restaurant is a revolving door 
of hungry students all day long.
“The mac and cheese and the 
greek salad are without a doubt 
our best sellers,” Brown said 
without missing a beat. The 
mac and cheese is one of Sava’s 
most recognizable dishes, with 
students coming back time and 
time again for the beloved bowl 
of cheesy goodness.
“In terms of breakfast, I 
think the avocado toast and 
kale breakfast bowl are the 
best 
menu 
items,” 
Brady 
finished. 
Lucky 
for 
Brady, 
her job is based out of the 
downtown SavCo offices, so 
she’s away from the heat of the 
busy kitchen, yet still has the 
privilege of coming into the 
restaurants to photograph and 
taste the memorable dishes. 
This is a job I know many 
University students would die 
to have, as so many of us would 
select Sava’s as our favorite 
option for a meal out in Ann 
Arbor.
Sava’s is one of the beating 
hearts 
of 
this 
community 
— with its reservation list 
filling up weeks before major 
weekends in town and the 
students’ 
consistent 
loyalty 
to its delicious food and one 
of a kind dining experience. 
When asked what it is like 
to be a part of such a large 
college 
community, 
Brown 
had so much to say about her 
experience working at Sava’s 
in Ann Arbor the past seven 
years.
“(The 
University) 
keeps 
us alive. The hospital, the 
students, the professors, the 
employees, the tourism — we 
have new guests from around 
the world all the time but we 
also have our devoted regulars. 
I get the opportunity to meet 
so many interesting people 
from so many walks of life 
every single day.”
Brown is passionate and 
enthusiastic about continuing 
to make Sava’s as remarkable 
as it can be, and it’s clear just 
from speaking with her that 
she’s successful in her mission. 
The restaurant business is no 
easy corner of the world to live 
in — with its erratic hours and 
constant challenges to tackle 
— but it is one that both Brown 
and Brady are ecstatic to be a 
part of.
“I mean it’s never boring 
in this business. It’s so fast 
paced and exciting. I love just 
meeting all of the different 
unique 
people 
involved 
in 
this process. It’s just simply 
addicting,” Brady said of her 
experience with her first year

A lot of great media begins 
with an airplane. There is 
the touching movie “We Are 
Marshall,” which details the 
rebuilding 
of 
the 
football 
program 
and 
morale 
at 
Marshall University following 
a plane crash that took the 

lives of 75 members of the 
football team. On TV, there is 
“Lost,” one of the most iconic 
and well-known shows of all 
time, due to both its consuming 
storyline and one of the most 
infamously confusing finales 
of all time. There is a lot 
that a show or movie can do 
with an airplane. It can tell 
a harrowing tale of human 
fear or a heartwarming story 
of community. It can paint a 
tear-jerking picture of reunion 
or show an unlikely character 
overcoming all odds. Yes, there 
are endless possibilities when 
it comes to basing a show off 

an airplane. “Manifest” takes 
advantage of none of them.
Following 
precedent, 
“Manifest” 
could’ve 
been 
a show about how people 
adjust after an unexpected, 
strange 
occurrence, 
but 
instead it takes a different 
route: superpowers. The main 
narrator, 
Michaela 
Stone 
(Melissa Roxburgh, “Valor”), 
is the first to experience a 
newfound telepathy as she is 
riding the bus. Her own voice 
speaks to her, repeating “slow 
down, slow down.” Michaela 
relays this message to the bus 
driver, which prompts him to 
slow down and avoid hitting 
a young boy chasing a ball 
into the street. Her brother 
Ben (Josh Dallas, “Once Upon 
a Time”) also hears his own 
voice, and it is revealed at the 
end of the episode that the 
Stone siblings are not the only 
ones. The episode ends with 
every person from the flight 
getting a pain in their head, 
drawing them to the tarmac 
the flight is docked at. As they 
all gather there, watching 
the plane that changed their 
lives, the plane blows itself up, 
emphasizing the supernatural 
direction “Manifest” plans to 
take.
On its surface, “Manifest” is 
an intriguing show. Flight 828 
took off from Jamaica in Apr. 
of 2013. After a spout of rough 
turbulence, the plane safely 
landed in New York — on Nov. 

4, 2018. None of the passengers 
were injured, and not a single 
one aged a day. Even with the 
slightly ridiculous time warp 
plot, “Manifest” still sets up 
enough emotional situations 
for its characters to redeem 
itself. Upon landing, the Stone 
siblings find that in their 
time missing, their mother 
has died, Cal’s twin sister is 
five years older than him and 
Michaela’s former fiance is 
married to another woman. 
Yet everything significant that 
happens in the first episode 
ends before it even begins, 
leaving very little room for the 
show to develop.
It’s a disorganized story, 
one that is vaguely interesting 
to watch but exhausting to 
follow. “Manifest” is the type 
of show you may only watch 
if you were staying home sick 
from school, or that your mom 
would DVR to watch later 
another day with a tall glass of 
wine. It uses shock factor to set 
up a story that could have been 
caused by literally anything 
else, sucking the story dry 
of uniqueness or enjoyment. 
A plane crash is a popular 
trope used among all forms 
of media, but the stunt can be 
overlooked if it is used in a way 
that creates an iconic piece of 
art. “Manifest” fails to do this, 
and thus becomes yet another 
tacky attempt at exploiting an 
overused gimmick, with no 
depth behind it to justify that.

ALEC COHEN / DAILY

in the restaurant business. 
She also mentioned that she 
knows she’ll be here for a while 
— the business has such an 
intoxicating and high energy, 
and this fits her personality so 
well.
“I love to make people’s 
days and connect with anyone. 
It is the best way to foster 
human interaction and meet 
people,” Brown said of her 
experience with the business. 
She circumvented challenges 
and confusing situations with 
ease even during our brief 
conversation — her go-getter 
attitude and organized form 
of leadership is the backbone 
of the whole place. It is known 
that the restaurant business is 
different and new everyday — 
fighting new fires that arise 
each day is one of the main 
jobs of a general manager, and 
she is perfectly suited for such 
a job.
When asked what’s next 

for Sava’s and SavCo at large, 
the ladies shared with me 
the inside scoop about the 
new SavCo restaurant — the 
DixBoro 
house, 
opening 
this spring. Even with new 
restaurants 
opening, 
and 
others thriving just down the 
road, Sava’s is continuing to up 
the ante.
“We’re tailoring what we 
do to the needs and wants of 
the community constantly,” 
Brady remarked, and I found 
this 
the 
perfect 
time 
to 
attempt to convince them to 
put the gluten free pancakes, 
porridge bowl and chicken 
sausage back on their fall 
brunch menu. They took the 
suggestions 
very 
seriously, 
noting that they always take 
the students’ advice and ideas 
into consideration.
“We’re always aesthetically 
improving, we have a new 
fall menu and drink menu 
coming and we’re constantly 

diversifying the menu and 
what we do here,” Brown said.
I left Sava’s with an intense 
craving for Sweety Fries, as 
one does, and not without 
inquiring 
about 
reservation 
openings for parents weekend, 
which is over a month away. 
They are already fully booked, 
which is unsurprising and 
makes me wish one place 
could seat more than 300 
people. With their current 
success, they would certainly 
thrive with an even bigger 
location, if at all possible. My 
biggest take away from my 
experience 
speaking 
with 
Brown and Brady, was their 
amiable nature and positive 
energy. They confirmed for me 
that what Sava’s does for our 
community is important and 
lasting, and left me hoping that 
I will be able to return for my 
favorite chicken sausage and 
banana topped porridge bowl 
sometime this fall.

Are you ready for a review 
of this weekend’s most hyped 
project? That’s right, today we’re 
going to dive deep into The Rick 
and Morty Soundtrack. I woke up 

this morning, set my Spotify to 
“Private Session,” and hit play, 
fully expecting to wince through 
the entire record.
The first track was the main 
theme, a boilerplate sci-fi intro, 
a pastiche of the “Doctor Who” 
main title theme. The next song, 
however, took me by surprise 
— “Jerry’s Rick” is an elegant if 
simple instrumental track that 
was, somehow, quite good. I 
began to take this soundtrack a 
little more seriously after that, 
having come in expecting to sit 
through 40 minutes of shit like 
“Get Schwifty.”
I came to find that there are 
three broad categories of songs on 
the soundtrack: The first consists 
of vocal tracks with lyrics that 
only function to advance the 
plot within the show (these are 
by-and-large pastiches of certain 
specific genres or artists), the 
second are instrumental tracks 
that deserve to be taken seriously 
on their own merits and the 
third are original songs done by 
outside artists — Chaos Chaos, 
clipping. and Chad VanGaalen all 
contribute songs inspired by the 
show.
Most of the first category are 
simply unlistenable outside of 
novelty value. “Flu Hatin’ Rap” 

comes to mind which, while 
being a competent work done in 
the style of the Sugarhill Gang, 
carries no comedic value of its 
own accord and is too dumb to 
be taken seriously. Of course, a 
lot of these songs are designed to 
be bad as a part of a joke, but just 
because they are intentionally 
bad doesn’t make them any more 
pleasant to listen to when the 
music is isolated from the plot. 
The one exception is “Goodbye 
Moonmen,” 
consisting 
of 
a 
tasteful and restrained acoustic 
chord progression and vocals 
which straddle the line between 
being an imitation or an excellent 
parody of David Bowie. It’s 
a shame that the lyrics make 
most of these songs borderline-
unlistenable 
outside 
of 
the 
context of the show.
The second category is by-and-
large filled with impressive and 
thoughtful works. The best song 
on the record is “African Dream 
Pop,” a genre of music invented 
for the purpose of the show. It is 
shockingly innovative, groovy 
and atmospheric; it’s really the 
only song worth returning to 
in the future. “Jerry’s Rick” 
and “Unity Says Goodbye” are 
balanced, cinematic works of 
composition that, while I don’t 
think necessarily merit repeated 
listens, certainly deserve to be 
viewed as more than songs from 
that one show with the alcoholic 
pickle guy. 
The third category is hit-or-
miss: “Stab Him in the Throat” is 
the most memorable of the pack, 
the experimental hip-hop group 
clipping. laying down bars over a 
reworking of the main title theme. 
The instrumental is a great remix 
apart from the overtaxed sample 
of Rick burping. Daveed Diggs 
comes with a hard flow, but 
whatever momentum he manages 
to build is sent crashing down 
by lines such as “He looking 
schwifty, man you shouldn’t 
trust him,” “hopped up out the 
whip, same color Pickle Rick” and 
“that habanero have him leakin’ 

Szechuan right there on the 
floor.” “Memories” is pretty but a 
bore. The vocalist of Chaos Chaos 
has a vulnerable, shoegaze-esque 
voice that almost saves the track, 
but it doesn’t quite do enough. 
The inoffensive song also has 
the advantage of never invoking 
“Pickle Rick.”

To be honest, if you aren’t 
a massive “Rick and Morty” 
fanboy, the only track worth 
listening to off this soundtrack 
is “African Dream Pop” (maybe 
“Goodbye 
Moonmen” 
if 
you 
have strong feelings about David 
Bowie). If you are a massive 
“Rick and Morty” fanboy (more 
power to you), you’ll probably 
love the whole album. The show 
has received a lot of probably 
undeserved backlash over the 
past year due to a particularly 
toxic fanbase, so I came into the 
soundtrack with certain off-
putting expectations. However, 
much like the show itself, the 
negative stereotypes surrounding 
the work are based in reality but 
largely exaggerated.

Defying expectations: ‘The Rick and Morty Sountrack’ 
doesn’t quite make you want to set yourself on fire

ALBUM REVIEW

JONAH MENDELSON
Daily Arts Writer

SUB POP RECORDS

Outside the theater where I 
saw “Night School,” there was a 
cardboard standee that depicted 
star 
Kevin 
Hart 
(“Jumanji: 
Welcome to the Jungle”) trying 
to climb out of a locker he has 

presumably been shoved into 
while an unimpressed Tiffany 
Haddish (“Uncle Drew”) stands 
outside with her arms crossed. 
 
Walking in, I took it as a piece 
of marketing and nothing more. 
Walking out after two hours of 
the sort of banal anti-comedy that 
has come to define Hart’s movie 
career, I’m not gonna lie, the image 
of his character being shoved in a 
locker took on a sort of cathartic 
quality. I’m used to saying that a 
movie wastes its cast, but this feels 
like a different cast, one which, 
especially the star and co-writer, 
wastes the movie.
In order to give you an idea of 
the sort of jokes “Night School” 
has up its sleeve, let’s look at the 
first scene that Hart and Haddish 
share together. Hart rolls up to a 
stoplight in his Porsche. Haddish 
stops next to him. She’s yelling 
about something raunchy over 
the phone, because raunchiness is 
innately funny. Hart tells her he 
can hear her, and she starts yelling 
because people yelling is innately 
funny. He psshes her, she psshes 
him back, and then they just start 
making weird noises at each other.
This goes on for quite some 
time.
This 
should 
probably 
go 
without saying, but taking a gag 

that isn’t funny to begin with and 
extending it to mind-numbing 
lengths isn’t the very essence of 
comedy, it’s the very essence of 
sadism. For all Hart’s experience 
as a comedian, this sort of scene is 
alarmingly commonplace. It gets 
to the point where these extended 
riff sessions start to infringe on 
the story. The godawful editing 
is annoying on its own, but it also 
clearly signals multiple important 
plot points, subplots or character 
arcs that are either montaged over 
or cut entirely, presumably to make 
room for the scene where Kevin 
Hart makes baby noises. With the 
theatrical cut already running an 
overindulgent two hours, one can 
only imagine the ego-stroking 
excess of the original.
That’s the biggest problem 
with the film. Comedies still have 
to tell stories, but “Night School” 
isn’t interested in all that. It’s just 
interested in making things as 
easy on Kevin Hart as possible. So 
his character has flaws, but most 
of his problems come from the 
overblown villains in his life — like 
his father (Keith David, “The Nice 
Guys”), or his high school rival 
turned principal (Taran Killam, 
“Single Parents”). He’s a serial liar 
who needs to change, but other 
people are the real problem. This 
keeps Hart from having to actually, 
you know, act.
Even when the script touches 
on something real, it can’t resist 
going for the easy way out. There 
are moments where it broaches 
the subject of learning disabilities 
and the shame that can come with 
that, but it doesn’t actually engage 
with these topics. It pays empty lip 
service to the idea of Hart learning 
differently, then cuts to a scene of 
Tiffany Haddish’s stunt double 
kicking the shit out of him in a 
hexagon to teach him math. Get 
it? Because it’s different. It’s short-
selling the message of the film for a 
bad joke, but it’s different.
What’s most disappointing is 
that we do see flashes of another 

version of “Night School.” Take 
a scene where we see Haddish 
working with a child with a 
learning disability and teaching 
him math by playing cards with 
him, for example. All I could think 
during this scene was that a similar 
scene between Hart and Haddish, 
done right, would have given them 
room to riff off each other in a 

believable setting, developed their 
characters and their chemistry 
and actually confronted the reality 
of people who learn differently. 
Yes, this scene would have been 
harder to write than, “Then she 
suplexes him and farts on his face.” 
Yes, the jokes would have been 
less broad. And yes, it would have 
been harder for Hart to sleepwalk 
through this version, but it would 
have been undoubtedly better than 
settling for weird noises and a fart 
joke.

‘Night School’ should be 
shoved in a locker for good

Midfielders’ play spurs 
Wolverines on offense

It 
may 
have 
been 
Meg 
Dowthwaite who scored the 
goal that put the No. 6 Michigan 
field hockey team (3-1 Big Ten, 
7-4 overall) on the board in 
its eventual 3-2 win over No. 
10 Northwestern (2-1, 7-5) on 
Friday. But to hear the junior 
forward tell it, she was just in the 
right place at the right time.
Instead, it was sophomore 
midfielder Kayla Reed whose 
perfectly-placed diagonal pass 
put Dowthwaite in position to 
hammer the ball straight into the 
goal.
“It was a great ball from 
Kayla,” Dowthwaite said. “And I 
was lucky that I was in the right 
position at the right time, to be 
honest.”
Added Reed: “I kinda got the 
ball on the right-hand side and 
kinda one of my specialties is 
going around the right, and I just 
saw it and took it and Meg was in 
the right spot.”
And though that goal was the 
most obvious example of midfield 
play 
creating 
opportunities 
for the Wolverines, it was far 
from the only time Michigan’s 
midfielders stepped up and found 
success.
Earlier in the season, the 
Wolverines struggled to score 
goals even with a litany of shots. 
Their one-dimensional offense 
relied on penalty corners and 
senior 
forward 
Emma 
Way. 
If Michigan wanted to score 
against an aggressive team like 
the Wildcats, it would be up to the 
midfielders to generate chances.
“Against 
Northwestern 
we 
were trying to transfer the ball 
to the other side and break 
their spine, as it’s called in field 
hockey,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “Which is, 
break their press. (That tactic) 
was really successful.”

Junior midfielder Guadalupe 
Fernandez Lacort was the main 
back-breaker. Playing in the 
center spot, Fernandez Lacort 
executed the transfer to near-
perfection in order to open up 
the offense, then finished off the 
Wildcats with several steals that 
led to breakaways.
Reed and junior midfielder Fay 
Keijer took it from there, passing 
to the forwards inside the circle 
or taking shots themselves. Late 
in the first half, Keijer stole 
the ball from a Northwestern 
defender, dribbled into the circle 
and roofed a reverse chip into 
the cage to put the Wolverines 
up 2-1.
“Fay had a really strong game 
today,” 
Pankratz 
said. 
“She 
sometimes plays forward and 
then we bring her back into the 
midfield, so she’s versatile. … She 
was really reliable today.”
Three of Michigan’s main 
midfielders 
graduated 
last 
year, forcing the Wolverines to 
experiment with new looks for 
the unit. It’s been a learning 
curve for the younger players, 
who sometimes struggled to find 
each other and get into position.
But as Reed came along the 
right and executed the perfect 
pass for the assist, as Keijer 
got the steal and the goal, as 
Michigan got three goals and a 
win against a top-10 conference 
rival, one thing was clear: Unlike 
other games, the Wolverines 
didn’t just have to rely on star 
fowards and penalties. Instead, 
the 
midfielders 
stepped 
up, 
created their own opportunities 
and became the key cogs in 
Michigan’s victory.
“Our 
transferring 
through 
the midfield is, I reckon, some 
of the best we’ve seen in a long 
time,” Reed said. “We’re able 
to get the ball from side to side, 
through (Ferndandez Lacort) in 
that center and it’s looking really 
nice.”

‘M’ gets three goals from three players in win

When sophomore midfielder 
Kayla Reed collapsed in a heap 
and laid on the ground after 
taking a ball to the side of the 
head, the entire crowd held its 
breath – right until she got up.
“Kayla’s 
a 
warrior,” 
said 
Wolverines 
coach 
Marcia 
Pankratz. “She’s a tough player 
and 
she’s 
experienced 
and 
smart. It doesn’t surprise me 
that that would happen.” 
Reed quickly recovered, and 
on the very next play received 
a pass on the right sideline, 
deked the Northwestern (7-5 
overall, 2-1 Big Ten) defender 
along the baseline and passed 
the ball right in front of the net 
to Michigan’s second leading 
scorer, Meg Dowthwaite. The 
junior midfielder scored the 
Wolverines’ (7-4, 3-1) first goal 
of the evening en route to a 3-2 
victory.
“We’ve 
been 
working, 
actually, in practice around 
baseline carries,” Dowthwaite 
said. “It was a great ball from 
Kayla and I was just lucky that 
I was in the right position at the 
right time.”
The 
game 
started off slow 
for 
Michigan, 
which 
failed 
to 
garner 
any 
scoring 
opportunities 
while 
the 
Wildcats 
had 
four in the first 
20 
minutes 
of the game. 
Freshman 
goalkeeper 
Anna 
Spieker had a couple of big saves 
on the second of Northwestern’s 
three penalty corners, twice 
using her right blocker to knock 
the ball away.
On the third corner, however, 
Spieker and the Wolverines 
were not as lucky as an elevated 
Wildcats shot snuck its way into 
the upper net.
“(Spieker’s) so young but 

very experienced and poised, 
skilled, makes good decisions,” 
Pankratz said. “I think the 
team trusts her back there and 
she keeps us in the game each 
day and we love having her 
defending our goal.”
Mere minutes later, junior 
midfielder Fay Keijer zigzagged 
her way through 
the 
Wildcat 
defense and fired 
a backhanded shot 
that bounced off 
the Northwestern 
goalkeeper 
and 
landed in the top 
corner. The goal 
gave Michigan a 
2-1 lead with only 
1:30 left in the 
first half. 
From there, the Wolverines 
never relinquished their lead 
and carried the momentum the 
rest of the game. 
“The mark of this team, Team 
46 this year, is that we really stay 
steady and play 70 minutes,” 
Pankratz said. “We don’t let the 
momentum switch too much 
and so they stay focused and 
keep working hard. I think that 
was evident in getting the goal 

back right away.” 
For the majority of the second 
half, Michigan dominated the 
ball and maintained possession. 
Just five minutes in, senior 
forward Emma Way extended 
the Wolverines’ lead to two. 
Michigan racked up seven 
shots in the half compared 
to 
just 
two 
shots 
from 
the 
Wildcats, 
both of which 
came off rare 
mistakes.
Michigan’s 
first error came 
15 minutes into 
the 
half. 
An 
errant pass led 
to a one-on-one 
opportunity for 
Northwestern junior Saar De 
Breij between her and Spieker. 
De Breij won the battle as she 
smoothly dribbled around the 
young goaltender and cut the 
deficit to one goal.
Then, 
with 
only 
8:42 
remaining, Reed was awarded 
a potentially costly green card 
and the Wildcats were given 
an opportunity to tie up the 
game. Even being down a player, 

though, the Michigan defense 
was stout and staved off any 
true 
Northwestern 
scoring 
opportunities. 
“We slipped up a few times 
here and there, but I’m really 
proud of the girls for staying 
in it,” Reed said. “It’s not easy 
having a one-goal lead, it’s a hard 
position to be in, 
but I thought we 
handled it really 
well.”
No matter the 
way 
in 
which 
they got there, 
the 
Wolverines 
ended the night 
with a victory 
over 
a 
highly-
ranked opponent.
“Anytime you 
can beat a Big Ten opponent 
we’re thrilled,” Pankratz said. 
“We’re working on a very 
particular kind of tactic and 
we’re trying to transfer with 
some good midfield passing. 
“I thought, when we did that 
today, we were super successful 
and I was happy about being 
able to grow from that and take 
that into the next couple of 
games.”

Michigan’s home win streak snapped by straight-set loss to Penn State

The phrase “home sweet 
home” has brought nothing 
but success for the No. 17 
Michigan women’s volleyball 
team.
That is until Sunday, when 
the Wolverines (2-2 Big Ten, 
13-2 overall) fell to Penn 
State (2-2, 11-3) in straight 
sets by a score of 17-25, 21-25, 
23-25, tarnishing the perfect 
9-0 home record they held 
entering the match. Under the 
guidance of Russ Rose, the 
NCAA’s all-time winningest 
women’s volleyball coach, the 
Nittany Lions picked up their 
11th victory of the season 
in one of the conference’s 
toughest atmospheres: Crisler 
Center.
Penn 
State 
jumped 
out 
to a hot start, grabbing an 
early 6-2 lead as a result of a 
handful of errors committed 
by the Wolverines. Soon after, 
Michigan found its footing 
and used a pair of big stuff 
blocks in the middle from 
sophomore 
middle 
blocker 
Kiara Shannon to trim the 
Nittany Lions’ lead to 8-10. 
A few points later, a huge 
cross-court kill from senior 
outside hitter Carly Skjodt cut 
the deficit to 10-11. With the 
momentum in the Wolverines’ 
favor, a heroic dig by senior 
libero Jenna Lerg set up yet 
another Skjodt kill, a turning 
point that gave Michigan a 
13-12 advantage — its first 
lead of the match since being 
up 1-0. But to the Wolverines’ 
demise, Penn State closed the 
set on a 13-4 run to take the 
opening set by a score of 25-17.
Michigan 
played 
significantly better coming out 
of the gates in set two, going 
up 5-4 following a pair of kills 
and a service ace from Skjodt. 
After an accurate cross-court 
swing on a slide by Shannon 
and a wrist-away kill from her 
middle blocker counterpart, 
redshirt junior Cori Crocker, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
middle 
blockers began to take control 
of the match at net. Later in 

the set, Michigan took a 12-10 
lead thanks to a lethal swing 
by freshman outside hitter 
Paige Jones off of a perfectly 
placed back-row ball by senior 
setter 
MacKenzi 
Welsh. 
Jones and Welsh showed off 
their 
excellent 
chemistry 
throughout 
the 
match, 
finishing 
with 
11 
assist-kill 
connections.
“Paige 
is 
a 
great 
physical 
player and she’s 
still growing as 
a great mental 
player,” 
said 
senior 
libero 
Jenna 
Lerg. 
“She has a good mindset right 
now, and she’s a talented all 
around player which is what 
we need. Having her on the 
court has been really fun — 
she’s great to play alongside.”
Meanwhile, the Wolverines 
as a whole were plagued by 
their own errors throughout 

the rest of the set. Over the 
course of the match, Michigan 
committed a total of 32 total 
errors en route to just a .150 
attack percentage, its second-
lowest mark of the season. 
Those numbers have given 
the Wolverines a focus for 
practice 
this 
week.
“We 
were 
a 
little 
bit 
sloppier tonight 
than we usually 
are but I think 
that’s 
because 
we were playing 
a better team 
and we wanted 
to 
go 
harder 
to 
challenge 
them,” Lerg said. “It’s good 
motivation for practice this 
week so we can have our 
hitters work on scoring points 
instead of just putting the 
ball in play. I don’t think it’s 
something negative — rather, 
it’s something to focus on this 
week.”

Despite 
the 
low 
attack 
percentage 
on 
Sunday 
afternoon, 
Crisler 
Center 
boasted an energetic crowd 
of 5,433 fans — a figure 
that exceeded the previous 
2018 attendance record of 
5,210 from Michigan’s Sept. 
14th sweep of 
Notre 
Dame. 
This 
season’s 

massive 
turnouts 
haven’t 
gone 
unnoticed 
by 
the Wolverines 
on the court.
“We’ve pulled 
a great amount 
of 
attendance 
in 
our 
home 
games so far, and the fans who 
come out to support us are 
awesome,” said Lerg. “They’re 
really good volleyball fans 
— they know when to cheer. 
If we’re feeling down on 
ourselves, we feed off them. 
When they get riled up, we 
hear their energy. They’re 

loud during the point when 
someone makes a great dig 
or has a great swing. It’s 
awesome and we really enjoy 
it as a team.”
Even with such a large 
home crowd, Penn State still 
managed to control one major 
aspect 
of 
the 
game 
— 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 
consistently 
outplayed 
the 
Wolverines 
in 
their 
performance at 
the service line. 
Even when its 
serves 
weren’t 
aces, which it 
had 
four 
of, 
Penn State’s ball pace took the 
Wolverines out of system for 
most of the match.
“Once they built a lead, 
they really started ripping 
their serves,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “They had 
a much bigger cushion which 
allowed them to be a lot more 

aggressive. All of a sudden, 
we had to weather that too 
because they were going at 
full speed without worrying 
about the risk.”
Even while serving with 

maximum 
aggression, 

Penn State committed just 
five service errors on the 
afternoon — a figure that 
serves as a strong testament 
to their talent and precision at 
the service line.
As 
for 
how 
he 
tackled 
the task of slowing down 
the Nittany Lions’ service 
momentum, 
Rosen 
said, 
“Their rotation one killed us. 
In the final set, their rotation 
one only scored one point at 
the service line. I thought 
we did a really good job of 
stopping that rotation after 
spinning our lineup to give 
us better matchups. I was 
glad we were able to make the 
adjustment and prevent that 
from beating us.”
On the offensive end, Skjodt 
led the Wolverines with 15 
kills on 44 swings with 3 errors 
— a .273 attack percentage 
— while Jones added 11 kills 
on 22 attempts with 4 errors 
— a .318 attack percentage. 
Skjodt’s 
14.7 
attempts 
per 
set marks a season high for 
her, something that can be 
attributed to both gameplan 
and the natural flow of the 
match, according to Rosen.
“We set Carly a lot from a 
tactical standpoint, but there 
are also a lot of situations 
when we’re out of system and 
she’s the only person we can 
set on the antenna,” Rosen 
said. “She’s a great outlet 
to have when we’re in a bad 
situation. Forty-four attempts 
is more than we’d like to set 
her but we had to because of 
how often we found ourselves 
out of system today.”
Despite 
being 
on 
the 
wrong side of the sweep, 
the Wolverines still found a 
number of takeaways from 
today’s match to help them 
improve 
moving 
forward. 
Rosen said it best: “That’s 
what up and down play will do 
to you.”

Karan Higdon relishes workhorse role he played against Northwestern

Even 
when 
he 
wanted 
to forget about it, Karan 
Higdon couldn’t avoid seeing 
his 
holding 
penalty 
from 
Saturday’s 
20-17 
win 
at 
Northwestern.
“(I’ve seen it) a couple times, 
I had no choice,” Higdon said. 
“A lot of people sent it to me. 
It’s one of those things that — 
I can’t say it happens — I have 
no explanation for it. … I don’t 
know how that happens.”
The senior running back 
was faked a handoff up the 
middle, 
getting 
swallowed 
at the line of scrimmage by 
a Wildcat player while Shea 
Patterson scrambled to the 
left for a 20-yard pickup. 
While Higdon was sent to the 
ground, so was the yellow 
penalty 
flag, 
calling 
back 
Patterson’s run and stymying 
a potential comeback drive in 
the fourth quarter.
The call was a blemish 
on 
an 
otherwise 
hard-
nosed contest that primarily 
featured Higdon. With junior 
running back Chris Evans — 
who Higdon calls his “partner 
in crime” — again sidelined 
due to an injury, Higdon was 
the Michigan football team’s 
bellcow. He toted the ball 30 
times for 115 yards and two 
touchdowns — one of which 
gave the Wolverines their first 
lead with 4:06 left in the game. 
It’s no wonder that on the 
fake handoff, Northwestern 
swarmed him.
Higdon’s 30 attempts are 
hardly eye-popping; it’s only 
tied for the 55th-most rushing 
attempts in Michigan history. 
It’s not even the most he’s had 
as a running back — he tallied 
35 rushes in his freshman year 
of high school. But in a pivotal, 
“prove it” year in the Jim 
Harbaugh era, the workhorse 
role given to Higdon in Evans’ 
absence is emblematic of just 
how much trust the coaches 

and players have in him to 
fulfill that role.
“He’s a very valuable player 
in the backfield,” said redshirt 
sophomore tight end Nick 
Eubanks. “I have no doubt in 
mind that he’ll run the ball, 
break 
tackles. 
He 
always 
has the urge to get the extra 
yardage off breaking tackles. 
I’m glad to have a dude back 
there like that.”
And 
as 
Higdon 
stood 
before the media on Monday 
afternoon, the wear and tear 
from Saturday’s game was 
non-existent. He has a trusted 
post-game and rehab routine 

— contrast bath therapy, a 
massage and repeat.
After 
all, 
Higdon 
has 
seen 
similar 
work 
before. 
The senior popped off for a 
previous high of 25 carries in 
a dominant 200-yard, three-
touchdown 
performance 
against Indiana in 2017. But on 
Saturday, the running lanes 
were tighter and Higdon had 
more difficulty getting chunk 
yardage — 12 of his carries 
went for three yards or fewer. 
And yet, his versatility and 
pass protection kept him as 
the lead back.
“He really got the ability 

to run all the assortment of 
runs,” Harbaugh said. “He’s 
not really in a category where 
he can only do inside runs or 
can only do outside runs, he 
can do both. (He) can also 
pass protect. High level of 
trust with Karan in every 
phase, including ball security. 
It allows us to do as much as 
the offense has.”
Even with a career-high 
in carries, the performance 
was a not a career-best. But 
his dependability rested not 
only in Higdon’s run game, 
but in his level-headedness. 
Higdon said he gets “hotter 

and hotter” with more carries, 
an assertion evidenced by his 
night-capping, fourth quarter 
touchdown.
His 
calmness 
was 
also 
emblematic of his sideline 
demeanor 
in 
a 
comeback 
situation.
“This was a game where 
guys had to really dig deep, 
look in the mirror and see 
how bad they really want it,” 
Higdon said. “Guys like myself, 
the other three captains, Shea, 
a lot of the guys on the defense 
stepped up, coaches — just 
saying, ‘Keep going, it’s a four 
quarter game, we have all a 

whole other half. This it the 
time to make a difference.’ 
And we did that.”
For now, Evans’ timetable 
to return is still a mystery. 
But without him, Higdon and 
his team still don’t bat an eye. 
When Higdon was told of the 
current Michigan record for 
rushing attempts — 51 carries 
by Chris Perry in 2003 — he 
laughed.
“50 carries? Shoot, I’d do it 
though,” he said. “… Whatever 
it takes to get the job done.”
And that’s what Higdon did 
Saturday, despite how ugly it 
was.

Runyan: O-line improved, but still needs work

The season-opening loss 
to 
Notre 
Dame 
displayed 
numerous truths about the 
Michigan football team. It 
showed 
that 
the 
addition 
of 
one 
player 
— 
junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson 
— couldn’t fix everything. It 
showed the beginnings of a 
heavily-penalized defense. It 
showed a continuation of the 
Wolverines’ struggles on the 
road.
But at the defeat’s core 
was an offensive line that 
was outmatched. Michigan 
allowed three sacks while 
struggling 
to 
generate 
substantial push for senior 
running back Karan Higdon. 
That 
combination 
— 
a 
quarterback with little time 
and a running back with little 
room — culminated in only 
one 
offensive 
touchdown 
against the Fighting Irish.
“Notre Dame showed us 
what we needed to work on,” 
said senior left tackle Jon 
Runyan Jr. “For me, it was 
definitely pass protection.”
The emphasis has been 
clear 
in 
the 
following 
weeks, albeit versus lesser 
competition. 
Michigan’s 
offensive line has allowed 
five sacks in its four games 
since, as Patterson has had 
noticeably 
cleaner 
pockets 
from which to throw.
“Pass protection is going 
pretty well,” Runyan said. “… 
Shea’s had time, and when 
he has time, he can make 
unbelievable plays with his 
arm.”
Patterson’s 
ability 
was 
apparent in Michigan’s game-
winning drive Saturday. He 
found redshirt junior tight 
end Zach Gentry twice for 
gains of 12 and 22 yards to 
set up Higdon’s go-ahead 
touchdown.
Most 
importantly, 
they 
were completions that were 
well 
protected. 
Patterson 
went 
through 
multiple 
progressions before throwing 
both passes, allowing Gentry 

enough time to get open 
thanks to his offensive line.
Now, 
Runyan 
sees 
run 
blocking as his unit’s biggest 
area 
for 
improvement. 
Excluding jet sweeps and 
quarterback 
runs, 
the 
Wolverines ran for 126 yards 
on 33 carries Saturday. That’s 
respectable 
but, 
especially 
with 
Higdon’s 
yards-after-
contact, 
not 
ideal.
“We’re 
not 
at 
the 
point 
we 
need 
to 
be,” 
Runyan 
said. 
“I 
think 
we 
averaged 
(around) 
three 
yards per carry 
last week, and 
we want to get that up around 
four, four and a half. … That’s 
something 
that’s 
been 
a 
big point of emphasis as an 
offensive line.”
There’s been no shortage 
of criticism for the group this 
season. From former standout 
receiver 
Braylon 
Edwards 
to 
fans, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
line 
has 
been 
dragged through the mud on 
social media.

It’s been a challenge for 
Runyan to manage all that 
noise. For he and fifth-year 
senior right tackle Juwan 
Bushell-Beatty 
especially 
— the most popular targets 
of criticism — it’s a delicate 
balance using it as motivation 
and not listening at all.
“The narrative has been 
going in ever 
since 
I’ve 
been here that 
the Michigan 
offensive line 
hasn’t 
been 
up 
to 
the 
standards that 
people outside 
this 
building 
would 
like,” 
Runyan 
said. 
“We take that 
personally, and we’ve been 
trying to (change that) every 
day.
“When it comes to certain 
things that go on during the 
game, people have no idea 
what our scheme is on the 
play, no idea how we block it. 
… Stuff like that, we take it 
with a grain of salt it doesn’t 
affect me too much.”
It helps Runyan to know 
he’s 
an 
everyday 
starter. 

Even 
with 
his 
struggles 
and growing hype around 
redshirt 
freshman 
James 
Hudson and true freshman 
Jalen Mayfield, coach Jim 
Harbaugh hasn’t wavered on 
his starting group.
That’s allowed chemistry 
to build up front. Last week, 
junior guard Ben Bredeson 
said 
communication 
was 
the offensive line’s biggest 
jump 
since 
Notre 
Dame 
— something Runyan now 
believes comes naturally on 
the left side.
“Being with Ben working 
with him since the beginning 
of camp, we have that non-
verbal communication going 
where we don’t really need 
to say much — we know what 
to do,” Runyan said. “Having 
that consistency has been 
really helpful.”
Added 
Harbaugh: 
“(Runyan’s) 
been 
healthy, 
stronger this year playing 
with physical demeanor. He’s 
always been athletic, but he’s 
stronger at the point of attack. 
Playing good football.”
With their play on Saturday, 
perhaps that last point can be 
extrapolated to the rest of the 
offensive line as well. 

‘M’ sweeps Rutgers

The job every week for the No. 
17 Michigan volleyball team is to 
handle business and get the win. 
So against Rutgers, the Wolverines 
could be considered overqualified.
The Scarlet Knights have won 
only one out of 80 Big Ten games 
since joining the conference, and 
on Friday, the Scarlet Knights 
continued the trend of losing by 
bowing out to Michigan in straight 
sets, 3-0.
The Wolverines played the match 
much like how a typical work day 
would go. Up early, staying strong 
until the break but ready for the 
day to end at close. Michigan put in 
work on the offensive and defensive 
end in the first two sets, providing 
little reason for scare until the third 
set, when it lost focus and dug itself 
in an early deficit. However, the 
Wolverines responded in quick 
succession to quash any doubt that 
they would win.
“Being down or being close to a 
team and being able to keep playing 
our own game,” said junior outside 
hitter Sydney Wetterstrom. “And I 
think that we’ve implemented it in 
this match, and we’ve been working 
on it.”
Playing its game and style had 
given Michigan success all season, so 
the team had little reason to change. 
With their balanced offense, the 
Wolverines were led by senior outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt and Wetterstrom 
in the first set. With three runs of four 
or more, Michigan built an early lead 
that it wouldn’t relinquish, winning 
the first set 25-11.
Rutgers had little response in the 
second set as well. Though it put up 
a much better fight, the efforts of 
the Wolverine veterans proved to be 
too much to overcome. Junior setter 
Mackenzi Welsh, in particular, 
played her part in controlling the 
pace of play.
“(Welsh) ran a great offense,” 
Wetterstrom said. “I think tonight, 
she was seeing the block. She was 
heading away from the block, we had 
a lot of one-on-one, or one-on-nones 
hitters, and she was utilizing going 
against the mismatch, and she just 
did a really good job placing the ball.”
For part of the third set, the 

Scarlet Knights worked out an 
answer.
This time, it was an approach 
Michigan 
had 
seen 
before. 
Opposing services have proven to 
be a challenge for the Wolverines all 
season if they deviate any bit from 
the standard serve. Michigan saw 
it with Nebraska and with Iowa. 
And as both teams started play after 
intermission, Rutgers pulled out the 
same tactic.
Quickening the pace at which 
she served, Scarlet Knight Marle 
Weidt disrupted the pace of play 
for Michigan by preventing the 
Wolverines from setting up their 
receive defense. Unsettled, the team 
allowed Rutgers a 7-3 lead.
“That server was going back and 
serving as soon as the ref blew the 
whistle, and that’s not something 
we see very often,” Welsh said. “In 
the Big Ten especially, and she was 
putting really good pace on the ball, 
and so we put our three best passers 
back there to be able to fight her off 
and be able to get out of the rotation 
as fast as possible.”
With a lineup of sophomores 
defensive 
specialists 
Jacqueline 
DiSanto and Natalie Smith and 
senior libero Jenna Lerg in the 
back row, Mark Rosen opted for 
a defensive lineup specializing in 
receiving. The Wolverine coach saw 
the struggle and realized the need to 
respond.
With 
better 
first 
touches, 
Welsh saw the burden of having to 
coordinate passes off of bad touches 
lifted. Michigan, through the efforts 
of Welsh, Wetterstrom and Skjodt, 
fought back to win the set 24-26 and 
claim the match 3-0. Welsh ended 
the night with 41 assists while Skjodt 
and Wetterstrom tallied 15 and 11 
kills, respectively.
“I think the passing and defense 
tonight was amazing from all the 
people that played back row for our 
team,” Welsh said. “I think I was 
put in really good positions to out 
our hitters in really good positions 
because of that. And I think all of 
our hitters did amazing and got hits 
when we needed them and fought 
hard through every single push.”
Though Michigan lapsed at 
moments during the game, the 
match ended up as just another day’s 
work for the team.
