ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Candidate addresses 
Flint, Detroit Public 
Schools in final bid for 

state’s votes 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Charles H. Wright Museum 

of African American History in 
Detroit was packed with 400 
people on Monday for presidential 
candidate Hillary Clinton’s last 
rally before the March 8 Michigan 
primary.

Michigan’s primary allocates 

130 delegates, a significant amount 
at this stage in the primary cycle. 
Challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–
Vt.) held a rally the same evening 
in the University of Michigan’s 
Crisler Center.

Clinton 
is 
anticipated 
to 

win the Michigan primary by 
a 
20-point 
margin 
according 

toRealClearPolitics.

During Monday’s rally, Clinton 

avoided mention of her primary 
rival and instead focused a series of 

attacks on Republican frontrunner 
Donald Trump — whose mention 
resulted in a strong negative 
reaction from the crowd.

Clinton 
encouraged 
her 

supporters to vote for her Tuesday 
so that she could secure the 
nomination soon, allowing her to 
focus on the eventual Republican 
nominee instead of Sanders.

“We will not a let a person like 

that become president of the United 
States,” she said. “The sooner I 
could become your nominee, the 
more I can turn attention to the 
Republicans.”

Prior to Clinton’s appearance, 

the crowd heard from elected 
officials 
who 
have 
previously 

endorsed her, including Detroit 
Mayor Mike Duggan, U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell (D–Dearborn) and 
Detroit City Council president 
Brenda Jones.

Just before Clinton walked 

onstage, overhead speakers also 
played a message emphasizing 
Hillary’s support for Flint, and 
Clinton began her speech by 
further acknowledging the crisis 
and repeating her promise to stand 

Presidential 
hopeful draws 

crowd of 5,700 day 

before primary

By EMMA KINERY

Daily News Editor

Supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie 

Sanders 
(D-Vt.) 
filled 
Crisler 

Center Monday for the candidate’s 

first visit to Ann Arbor: a “Get Out 
To Vote” rally the day before the 
Michigan primary.

The crowd began by chanting, 

“Feel the Bern, Bernie will make it 
easy to learn; Feel the Bern, Bernie 
will make it free to learn.”

Sanders’ first visit to Michigan 

was in February, when he held 
a rally at Eastern Michigan 
University in Ypsilanti.

“Words cannot describe how 

excited I am,” said LSA sophomore 
Nicholas Kolenda, president of 

Students for Sanders, before the 
rally. “We’ve been wanting him 
to come here for months, and for 
him to come here on Monday — 
right before Michigan’s primary 
tomorrow — we’re ecstatic. We’re 
all ecstatic, so excited.”

The 
student 
organization 

helped distribute posters and get 
the crowd excited for the rally.

Choosing the University of 

Michigan to host the rally in 
particular may have been less about 
politics as much as it was about 

logistics: though the University’s 
Spring Break was last week but 
most colleges in the state including 
Michigan State, Grand Valley State 
University and Central Michigan 
University, among others, do not 
have class this week. The Sanders 
campaign has relied on youth 
voters throughout the primaries 
thus far, and the Michigan primary 
falling on many colleges’ Spring 
Breaks could hurt the campaign on 
Tuesday.

Conference will 
incorporate open 

dialogue on recaps of 
panels, workshops

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

At its Monday meeting, 

the 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs discussed the Faculty 
Governance 
Conference 

occurring next Monday and 
Tuesday at the Michigan 
League. The conference will 
host 
faculty 
governances 

from 
universities 
around 

the country, including Big 
Ten schools, the University 

of Virginia, the University 
of 
North 
Carolina, 
the 

University of California, Los 
Angeles and the University of 
California, Berkeley.

The conference, featuring 

speakers, 
panels 
and 

discussions 
about 
faculty 

governance 
around 
the 

country, 
includes 
keynote 

speaker 
Laura 
Kipnis, 
a 

communications professor at 
Northwestern University.

Last year, Kipnis published 

an essay in the Chronicle 
of 
Higher 
Education 

about 
student-faculty 

relationships 
that 
drew 

attention from Northwestern 
administrators. The article 
critiqued 
Northwestern’s 

policies regarding student-
faculty 
relationships 

and 
sexual 
misconduct, 

citing a lawsuit between a 
Northwestern 
philosophy 

professor and two students 
who accused him of assault. 
After a Title IX retaliation 
complaint was filed against 
Kipnis, alleging her piece 
misstated facts and created 
a hostile environment, the 
university 
subsequently 

opened a formal investigation 
into the incident. In May 
2015, Kipnis was cleared in 
the investigation, according 
to The Washington Post.

SACUA 
chair 
Silke-

Maria Weineck, a professor 
of 
comparative 
literature, 

said she hopes a nationwide 
consortium results from the 
conference.

HALEY MCLAUGHLIN/Daily

SACUA Chair Silke-Maria Weineck discusses the need for a Senate Assembly that is representative of the entire 
university in the Fleming Building on Monday.

From THE MICHIGAN DAILY

The 
Michigan 
primary 

elections bring four Republican 
candidates and two Democratic 
candidates to the ballot box. 
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) 
and Hillary Clinton have had 
a strong presence in Michigan 
this week. On Sunday night, 
both debated in Flint, and 
Monday, Bernie rallied students 
in the Crisler Center while 
Hillary 
assembled 
faithful 

supporters in Detroit. Despite 
Sanders’ 
inspiring 
policy 

agendas 
and 
Obama-esque 

hope, it is with confidence that 
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board endorses Hillary Clinton 
for the Democratic presidential 
nominee.

Clinton is an experienced, 

qualified and diplomatic leader. 
She has served as a U.S. senator 
from New York, the secretary 
of state and as the first lady. As 
secretary of state, she worked 
on 
global 
policy 
including 

sanctions to Iran and a ceasefire 
in Israel and supported Obama 
in bringing Osama bin Laden 
to justice. She may have proved 
her preparedness for the job as 
president Sunday evening in 
her opening statement. Sanders 
stated 
that 
Michigan 
Gov. 

Rick Snyder should resign and 
Clinton followed, saying Snyder 
should resign or be recalled, 
but added discussion about 
how Flint can get help now. 
Clinton has the experience and 
the expertise to implement the 
changes cities like Flint need.

Furthermore, 
having 
a 

woman as president has the 

potential 
to 
fundamentally 

change how our country views 
women. This is certainly not 
the only reason she should get 
the female vote, but like Obama, 
her position in the White House 
will be condusive to social 
progress. Clinton as president 
could serve as a symbol for 
how far women can go, setting 
the stage for more female 
leaders in the future. As with 
every election, none of these 
candidates are perfect. But we 
are at an important stage in 
our country’s history and it is 
crucial to vote accordingly.

Sanders has created a rhetoric 

surrounding college tuition that 
is undeniably inspiring, calling 
for free tuition at all public 
universities. However, Clinton 
has sturdy policies that address 
student debt and hold colleges 
and universities accountable 
for making changes toward 
affordability — policies that 
are much more likely to gain 
bipartisan support.

Sanders 
also 
speaks 

passionately about big money 
in 
elections 
and 
essential 

campaign 
finance 
reform. 

Though change in this area is a 
noble goal, it’s far from the most 
important thing voters should 
consider in casting their vote 
during primaries. Yes, Clinton’s 
top donors are huge companies 
that represent big business 
interests — interests that do 
not align with ours. But the fact 
still remains that Clinton has 
the social stances and support 
from industries to make a real 
change.

Legislation 

proposes lesser 
consequences for 
first-time offenders

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

A Michigan Senate bill aiming to 

reduce the severity of consequences 
for minor in possession of alcohol 
charges passed the state Senate 
Mar. 3, moving to the state House.

The bill, introduced by state 

Sen. Rick Jones (R — Grand 
Ledge) last May, aims to address 
the issue of underage drinking by 
changing first-offense MIPs from 
a misdemeanor to a civil infraction. 
If passed, only after the first offense 
will a minor in possession charge 
become a misdemeanor, decreasing 
consequences for minors found in 
possession of alcohol.

Opposition to the bill thus far has 

been limited — it was passed with 
opposition from just two senators.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Jones said he 
initiated the bill because he was 
contacted by numerous parents 
who were upset about their children 
receiving misdemeanor charges. 
Jones said the charges typically 
resulted from minors being found 
in possession of one beer, but in 
many cases students also had 
been confronted by a University 
of Michigan police officer who 
asked them to take a breathalyzer. 
Regardless of the level of alcohol 
present, police would then issue 
students a ticket and charge them

Startup website 
will incorporate 
bundle offers, 
recipe feature

By JENNIFER MEER 

Daily Staff Reporter

Last 
spring, 
LSA 
junior 

Danny Mak saw an open niche 
in the University of Michigan’s 
market for a grocery delivery 
service. Since then, he and 
Kinesiology 
junior 
Thomas 

Marcus have worked to create 
the Big House Market, a service 
that will deliver groceries to 
University students.

Set to launch by March 21, Big 

House Market, which will be 
accessible through its website, 
targets 
University 
students 

who are unable to travel to 
grocery stores off campus.

In an interview, Marcus said 

the pair thought a service like 
Big House Market is essential 
for the student body, and could 
thrive in comparison to other 
grocery delivery services in 
the area. Several other food 
delivery startups also exist on 
campus — EnvoyNow, a student-
run service that launched this 
fall, delivers food to students 
from local restaurants, while 
Delivice, a grocery delivery 
company in Ann Arbor, was 
founded in February 2014.

“We just saw that there was 

an opportunity for it, and that 
it’s a relatively small startup, 
and that we think that we can 
do it better, just with more 
features to offer and a more 
integrative web platform that 
is easier to use and has more 
incentives for continuing to use 
it,” Marcus said. “We realized 
how many people we know for 
a fact we can reach right away 
upon starting, and we realized 
this is a great idea worth going 

with.”

The duo pointed to what 

they believe is a market need 
for same-day and next-day 
deliveries of food, especially for 
college students who don’t have 
cars and have busy schedules.

LSA junior Emma Planet said 

she thought the service would 
be helpful, and meet needs she 
has as a student.

“I think it would make things 

much more efficient,” she said. 
“It would save a lot of time and 
energy for someone who has a 
huge assignment coming up and 
they are frantic that they need 
to go get food. Also, I think 
that it would be convenient for 
people who don’t live on central 
or someplace where you can’t 
get food so easily. I would use 
it.”

Marcus said receiving the 

Evans 
Scholarship, 
which 

awarded both him and Mak a 
full-ride scholarship to attend 
the University, motivated them 

to pursue the project.

“The scholarship has kind 

of brought us toward pushing 
toward doing stuff that you’re 
not 100 percent comfortable 
with,” he said. “This is kind 
of the first step in our lives 
that we feel is pushing for big 
goals, trying to get big things 
done, and we think that it’s 
a great idea that’s going to 
penetrate Ann Arbor pretty 
well. The scholarship has 
given us those values.”

As 
for 
what 
makes 

their 
company 
unique 

to 
competitors, 
Marcus 

described 
the 
advantages 

of 
bundles 
— 
pre-designed 

collections of groceries — and 
recipes. Each “bundle” aims 
to target a different kind of 
customer 
and 
to 
optimize 

efficiency and timeliness for 
the customer.

“For example, some of the 

bundles will be a healthy 
bundle, a cooking bundle, a 
munchies or snack bundle,” 
he said. “ In addition to that, 
we think we’re going to have 
pre-made recipes, where we go 
online and we find ingredients 
for an easy-to-make recipe for 
a college student, and then sell 
that as a whole pack. So if it’s 
pasta, we’ll sell the pasta, the 
sauce, the butter and whatever 

else is needed — something 
like that, something simple. 
That’s not offered on any of the 
other websites. So that’s a big 
differentiator.”

Mak added that another perk 

of their service is same-day 
delivery, which many of their 
competitors do not offer. He 
said the team is now looking 
to finalize the project and hire 
employees by next year.

“I really think, it’s just about 

getting used to the process, 
getting used to the whole 
business, the ins and outs of 
the business and then having 
employees,” Mak said. “That’s 
really the main goal by next 
year.”

Marcus said he hopes the 

company sees expansions in 
the future, including adding 
categories to the inventory 
of products and launching a 
mobile application.

“Once 
we 
have 
more 

customers, more people relying 
on us, more drivers, we were 
considering 
adding 
to 
the 

inventory as we go along,” 
Marcus said. “We’re probably 
going to have a couple thousand 
options 
to 
start. 
However, 

there are still categories — not 
food categories — but stuff that 
Kroger would sell that people 
could find useful, that we’re not 
going to have. Like toiletries, 
for example.”

RYAN MCLOUGHLIN/Daily

Ann Arbor resident Hanna Raithel promotes U.S. Sen. Bernie 
Sanders’ (D-Vt.) rally in front of the Union on Monday. 

GAINING SU PPORT

Ted Cruz, a professor 

at the University of 
California, San Diego 
— not to be confused 
with Sen. Ted Cruz (R–
Tex.), one of the current 
candidates vying for the 
Republican presidential 
nomination — will 
discuss the San Diego-
Tijuana border at the 
University of Michigan 
on Mar. 11.

Prof. Cruz and Fonna 

Forman, also a professor 
at the University of 
California, San Diego, 
will deliver the lecture, 
focusing on the the 
political and urban 
architecture of the 
border.

Though they 

share a name, Prof. 
Cruz’s perspectives on 
immigration and the 
U.S.-Mexico border 
sharply contrast the 
senator’s immigration 

platform.

Prof. Cruz’s website 

says he sees these 
neighborhoods as “sites 
of cultural production, 
from which to rethink 
urban policy, affordable 
housing and civic 
infrastructure.”

Sen. Cruz has 

called for tightened 
border security and 
penalization of illegal 
immigrants, including 
ending amnesty 
protections and utilizing 
surveillance and 
biometric tracking.

Cruz and 

Forman, professors 
of architecture and 
political science 
respectively, will 
discuss research-
based political and 
architecture practices 
in San Diego, while also 
tying in the policy and 
infrastructure of Latin 

American cities near the 
border.

While Forman’s work 

is centered on human 
rights and equitable 
urbanization, Cruz’s 
research is focused 
on the San Diego-
Tijuana border and the 
benefits of advancing 
border immigrant 
neighborhoods.

Forman and Cruz are 

the keynote lecturers 
for the Michigan 
Mellon Project on 
Egalitarianism and the 
Metropolis, an initiative 
between Detroit, 
Mexico City and Rio 
de Janeiro. The project 
aims to combine design 
theory and practice with 
questions surrounding 
equality and social 
justice in communities.

Kinesiology junior Tommy Marcus and LSA junior Danny Mak discuss the launch of their new food delivery service, Big 
House Market, in Shapiro Library on Monday.

Student-led company aims to 
offer grocery delivery service 

“We’ve asked the guests to 

speak about the experiences at 
their schools, what has come up 
there, what are the challenges 
and what are the solutions,” 
Weineck said. “Each place has 
so much variance.”

Alongside Kipnis, SACUA 

members will be directing 
two-hour sessions with other 
schools. Session topics include 
academic freedom, due process 
protections, the role of faculty 
members and Title IX, which 
prevents 
federally-funded 

educational 
programs 
from 

discriminating on the basis of 
sex.

At 
Monday’s 
meeting, 

SACUA decided to allot time 

at the end of the conference 
for suggestions and concluding 
thoughts from the audience.

“Faculty governance is in 

trouble in so many places, 
so 
banding 
together 
and 

moving forward with some 
kind of shared principles and 
recommendations 
would 
be 

great,” Weineck said.

Pharmaceutical 
Sciences 

Prof. 
David 
Smith 
said 
a 

breakout session could allow 
guests to synthesize all the 
information they’d discussed 
together.

“While it’s still fresh in 

our head, it’d be nice to ask 
what are the major things we 
attempted 
to 
do, 
anything 

we learned and how do we 
want to move forward with 
suggestions?” he said.

Faculty selected 
as Alfred Sloan 
research fellows

Along with 126 scientists 

and scholars nationwide, three 
University professors were 
selected as the 2016 Alfred P. 
Sloan research fellows. The 
University professors selected 
are Paul Zimmerman, assistant 
professir of chemistry, Michael 
Cafarella and Honglak Lee, 
both assistant professors of 
electrical engineering and 
computer science, according to a 
University press release. 

The Sloan Research 

Fellowships were established in 
1955 and aimed to support and 
give recognition to scientists 
who otherwise do not receive 
outside funding. Though 
awards were originally given 
only in physics, chemistry and 
mathematics, other fields such 
as neuroscience, economics 
and ocean sciences were later 
added due to their scientific 
significance.

According to the foundation 

website, candidates for the 
fellowship must hold a tenure 
track at an institution in the 
United States or Canada, must 
hold a Ph.D. in a science-related 
field and must exhibit evidence 
of independent research 
accomplishments. 

Each awardee received 

$55,000 for any aspect of their 
research.

Online platform 
created to 
encourage public 
research input 

The University launched 

WellSpringboard this week, a 
platform University medical 
researchers will use for 
accepting suggestions from the 
public about what they should 
study next, according to release 
from the University Health 
System.

The crowdsourcing and 

crowdfunding platform is 
focused specifically on children’s 
heart disease and cancer, 
sleeping problems, adult diabetes 
and inflammatory bowel 
diseases, but the site welcomes 
any idea for their research.

Once medical researchers 

decide to take up a research 
project, donations can be made 
online and people can volunteer 
to participate or aid in the 
research as well. 

WellSpringboard highlights 

nine steps for those who are 
interested in being involved. 
These steps include submitting 
an idea along with a brief 
video about why the research 
is important, gathering votes 
for the idea and seeking out 
University researchers who 
might be interested in studying 
the topic. 

Search process 
begins for new 
CEW director, 
‘U’ committee 
selected

The search process for the 

next director of the Center for 
the Education of Women is now 
underway, with an advisory 
committee selected for the 
search, according to a University 
press release. 

Current CEW Director Gloria 

Thomas will step down from 
the position this June following 
seven years of tenure. 

Lynn Wooten, ssociate dean 

for undergraduate programs at 
the Ross School of Business, will 
chair the committee, which is in 
charge of conducting a national 
search for candidates eligible 
for the position. Once a list of 
candidates has been compiled, 
the committee will report to 
Vice Provost Sara Blair.

Other members of the search 

committee besides Wooten 
include professors from the 
Medical School, School of 
Social Work and the School of 
Nursing.

NEWS BRIEFS

with a misdemeanor, as state law 
mandates.

According to the University’s 

2013-2014 
Office 
of 
Student 

Conflicts and Resolutionsreport, 
there were 515 instances of illegally 
possessing or using alcohol on 
campus that year, including first 
and second-offense and three or 
more offence incidences grouped 
into three tiers. All three tiers 
of alcohol-related offense saw 
increases from the 2012-2013 OSCR 
report.

“(Current MIP laws are) actually 

driving students to use drugs,” 
Jones said. “Several parents told me 
that college students had decided 
it was better to smoke marijuana 
than drink a beer because the 
breathalyzer would not detect the 
marijuana in their system. I think 
this is a horrendous message we’re 
sending to young people — to use 
marijuana, that will keep you out of 
trouble.”

Currently, 
Michigan 
law 

mandates that for any alcohol-
related violations for individuals 
under 21, a misdemeanor charge is 
automatic. For the first violation, 
consequences of the charge include 
no more than a $100 fine. For a 
second 
violation, 
consequences 

include a fine of no more than 
$200, possibly accompanied by 

imprisonment of less than 30 days 
if a previous probation order was 
violated. A third violation results in 
a fine of no more than $500 along 
with potential imprisonment of less 
than 60 days if a previous probation 
order was violated. Substance 
abuse prevention services can be 
mandated at any step in the process 
as well.

“People believe that we should 

not criminalize young people for 
one offense of possession of alcohol 
because the consequences are not 
just a misdemeanor,” Jones said. 
“It affects their ability to get some 
college scholarships, it affects their 
ability to get jobs when they get out 
of college and, in fact, there’s some 
state jobs, if you have an MIP on 
your record, you can’t get a state 
job.”

MIP laws have been modified 

several times by the state in past 
years, generally with a focus on 
medical amnesty. In June 2012, 
House 
Bill 
4393 
took 
effect, 

exempting 
minors 
from 
legal 

prosecution if the minor in question 
or a minor who accompanied the 
minor in question specifically 
requested medical attention related 
to a legitimate health care concern 
after consuming alcohol, according 
to the legislature.

This and other medical amnesty 

laws, some of which have been 
extended to drug use, aimed to get 
immediate attention for a medical 
issue if necessary, without the 

concern of legal prosecution.

Some 
cities, 
including 
Ann 

Arbor, 
also 
utilize 
the 
First 

Offender MIP Deferred Sentence 
Program, which makes first-time 
MIP offenders eligible to avoid 
misdemeanor charges, according to 
University Student Legal Services. 
This program, offered by the 
15th District Court, mandates a 
student to attend the Brief Alcohol 
Screening and Intervention for 
College 
Students 
class. 
After 

six months of complying with 
probation 
requirements, 
no 

conviction would be entered to the 
student’s criminal record.

Jones 
said 
he 
thought 
it 

was important to go beyond 
current policy and ensure that 
consequences were reduced for all 
first-time MIP offenders.

“It’s really quite onerous for one 

misstep,” he said.

For University students, the bill 

could impact some — but not all — 
of the consequences of underage 
drinking. On campus, beyond state 
law, there are also consequences 
levied by the University in regard to 
alcohol use. The University Alcohol 
and Other Drug Policy specifically 
states that illegally possessing, 
using, distributing, manufacturing 
or selling alcohol at the University 
violates 
expectations 
outlined 

under the Statement of Student 
Rights and Responsibilities. If 
caught exhibiting these behaviors, 
students 
could 
face 
sanctions 

from the University as stated in 
theStatement of Student Rights 
and 
Responsibilities, 
including 

disciplinary probation, restriction 
from 
University 
employment, 

mandatory workshop attendance or 
transfer or removal from University 
housing.

LSA 
junior 
Erin 
Dunne, 

co-director of Students for a 
Sensible Drug Policy, said the 
student group thinks the legislation 
is a step forward in Michigan’s 
current framework of addressing 
underage drinking, but doesn’t 
acknowledge all of its concerns.

“The position of the Students for 

Sensible Drug Policy organization 
is that the drinking age should 
be lowered and it should be up to 
the states to decide,” Dunne said. 
“Overall, this legislation is definitely 
in the right direction, but it doesn’t 
include provisions that we would 
ultimately like to see. We don’t have 
a position on the best drinking age, 
but we think that states should be 
allowed to decide.”

Due to the fact that Senate Bill 

332 is pending legislation, the 
University declined to comment on 
this issue. However, several efforts 
have been launched in past months 
to 
combat 
underage 
drinking 

on campus, including piloting a 
program in which the University 
would alert parents of freshman 
students who incurred a second 
related 
violation. 
The 
Family 

Education Rights and Privacy 

Act allows, but does not require, 
universities to notify parents when 
an underage student incurs an 
alcohol or drug related violation. 
The 
University 
also 
initiated 

programs to engage with off-
campus students about drinking, 
along with updates to the “Stay in 
the Blue” cell phone application, 
which aims to help students 
monitor their blood alcohol content.

In 2014, the University also 

shortened 
freshman 
move-in 

times in an attempt to reduce 
opportunities for underage students 
to engage in alcohol consumption.

Jones said for him, legislation felt 

warranted because of continuing 
alcohol abuse on campus despite 
efforts by colleges to limit it.

“I 
certainly 
don’t 
support 

alcohol abuse, but I do feel (the 
consequences) should be fair,” he 
said.

Dunne 
echoed 
Jones’ 

sentiments, saying she thought 
current laws don’t succeed in 
restricting 
underage 
drinking 

and do considerable damage to an 
individual’s future.

“Students who do engage in 

responsible drinking and still are 
faced with a civil infraction or a 
minor in possession misdemeanor 
charge and haven’t had a problem 
with drinking actually experience 
more harm from the law than 
from the alcohol they’re drinking 
because there’s a misdemeanor that 
ends up on their record,” she said.

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally in Detroit Monday before Michigan’s primary on March 8.

by the people of Flint.

During Sunday’s Democratic 

debate in Flint, Clinton was asked 
if her support for the city was a 
political maneuver. On Monday, 
she reiterated that her intention 
is to continuously support Flint, 
drawing attention to the crisis and 
supporting the residents.

“I’m going to keep shining a 

bright spotlight on Flint,” she said. 
“We have made a commitment to 
help Flint recover and give them 

the opportunity to be even better 
after they do so.”

Clinton also discussed her 

plans to decrease the student debt 
burden through her $350 billion 
plan to help students pay for 
college and reduce interest rates. 
Her platform on student debt has 
the support of both Dingell and 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D–Mich.), 
who have both introduced student 
loan refinancing acts and are large 
proponents for reducing student 
debt 
and 
increasing 
college 

affordability.

University alum Neil Shah, 

who attended the event, said one 

of the many reasons he supports 
Clinton is her pledge to reduce 
student debt. As a recent graduate, 
he noted, his student loans have a 
continuing impact on his life.

“She has plans to provide 

student loan forgiveness for people 
like me,” he said. “People who have 
jobs but are not making enough 
to save for my future. I’m more 
focused on paying off my loans 
than savings for my future and she 
helps change that.”

Clinton 
also 
spent 
time 

discussing the state of Detroit 
Public 
School’s 
deteriorating 

infrastructure. 
The 
district’s 

approximately $3.5 billion debt has 
led to a severe lack of infrastructure 
repairs, causing issues like mold 
and rodent infestations.

She called upon Gov. Rick 

Snyder to remove the emergency 
manager that he instituted to 
manage Detroit Public Schools as 
a fix to the problems.

“Let’s make sure that every 

child in every zip code gets a 
good education,” she said. “In the 
Detroit Public Schools, under an 
emergency manager, we’ve got 
children in classrooms filled with 
mold and rodents. I think that the 
governor should turn back the 

control of the schools to the people 
of Detroit.”

Robyn McCoy, an attorney 

with the Michigan Children’s 
Law Center in attendance, said 
she thought the choice to hold the 
rally in Detroit and her attention to 
local issues demonstrates Clinton’s 
appeal.

“I think that this was a key 

location,” she said. “It shows the 
strengths of Hillary as a candidate 
that she is so well versed in local 
issues like Detroit Public Schools. 
It shows that she is multifaceted. 
She can help us on a local level and 
a national level.”

RALLY
From Page 1

After 
Sunday’s 
Democratic 

debate, Hillary Clinton is currently 
leading 
Sanders 
nationally 

by 
9.6 
percent 
according 
to 

a 
RealClearPolitics 
polling 

average. In Michigan, Clinton 
leads Sanders by 20.4 percent, 
according to a polling average 
byRealClearPolitics.

Aiming 
to 
inspire 
voters, 

Sanders said Monday night that the 
campaign is seen as revolutionary 
not only in its radical policies, but 
in their high voter turnouts.

“We believe ultimately that 

when millions of people come 
together and get involved in the 
political process, there is nothing 
that we cannot do,” Sanders said.

Before the senator took the 

stage, Detroit-based band JR JR 
performed, followed by Nate Ruess 
of the band FUN. Actress Shailene 
Woodley, Sen. Nina Turner (D–
Ohio) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D–
Hawaii) also all spoke favorably of 
the candidate.

Sanders’ speech covered all of 

the major points of his platform, 
from social issues like the wage 
gap and high incarceration rates 
to trade, revamping the higher 
education and health care systems 
to addressing climate change and 
the Flint water crisis.

The senator said his focus 

has been on listening to women, 
children and African Americans, 
along with other marginalized 
groups.

“What this campaign is about 

is raising issues that many other 
people prefer not to talk about at 
all,” Sanders said.

LSA 
freshman 
Jonathan 

George, who attended the rally, 
said he would be voting for Sanders 
in Tuesday’s primary because of his 
stance on listening to marginalized 
groups.

“I’ve been a longtime Sanders 

fan and I finally wanted to get the 
opportunity to see him in person, 
so I was very excited to be here,” 
George said. “I really like how 
Bernie, like he said, he focuses 
on policies that not many people 
talk about. He focuses on income 
inequality, gender issues, racial 
inequality — things that aren’t 
usually brought up in the normal 
election cycle. To find somebody 
who connects to their audience 
like that to the middle class so well 
and has the best interests of the 
middle class at heart the best, that 
he should be our president.”

LSA freshman Victoria Thach 

said she was inspired to support 
Sanders because of his inclusive 
campaign.

“I am a supporter of Senator 

Bernie, just because I am a first-
generation student,” Thach said. “I 
don’t come from a very high class, 
and being here at the University 
of Michigan, it’s a bit hard being 
surrounded by so many people of 
higher income, it makes me feel a 
little small sometimes, and I enjoy 
that he’s giving us smaller people a 
voice.”

In front of an audience of 

largely college students, Sanders 
discussed in depth his intentions 
to fix the higher education system. 

The senator said a college degree 
has become what a high school 
diploma was 50 years ago, and the 
inaccessibility of a diploma based 
on the rising cost of college has led 
him to view tuition-free education 
as the only option.

“When we think outside of the 

box, we choose to conclude that we 
need to make public colleges and 
universities tuition free,” Sanders 
said. “We need to substantially 
reduce student debt by allowing 
those with debt to refinance their 
loans at the lowest possible interest 
rates as they can.”

Kohlenda said it was this 

mindset about college that sparked 
engagement in the Student for 
Sanders chapter on campus. 

“(Students like him) especially 

for his proposals that go much 
farther than any other candidate 
to deal with college debt, and to 
basically make sure that college is 
universal,” he said.

 Countering claims that his plan 

wasn’t feasible, Sanders explained 
he intended to fund a free-tuition 
program with a tax on corporate 
speculation.

“When people say: ‘How can 

we afford free tuition at colleges 
and universities? How can we 
pay to reduce student debt? It’s 
an expensive proposition.’ It is,” 
Sanders said. “You know what 
we’re going to do? We’re going 
to propose a tax on Wall Street 
speculation.”

He also tied investment in the 

education system to another piece 
of his platform — fixing the issue of 
mass incarceration.

“If anybody here thinks that 

there is not a connection between 
that very high rate of youth 
unemployment and the number of 
people we have in jail — you would 
be mistaken,” Sanders said. “Ready 
for a radical idea? We are going 
to invest for our young people in 
education and jobs, not jails and 
incarceration.”

In addition to investing in jobs, 

Sanders touched on resolving the 
wage gap between men and women, 
which he said is maintained based 
on “old fashioned sexism.”

The loudest audience responses 

of the night, however, occurred 
when the senator discussed the 
issue of women’s health.

“(The movement is) telling 

Republicans who talk about family 
values that we know what they talk 
about, and what they’re talking 
about is telling every woman in this 
arena, in this state, in this country, 
that she cannot control her own 
body. I disagree,” Sanders said.

That enthusiasm was also clear 

when Sanders repeated a call for 
Gov. Rick Snyder’s (R) resignation 
in wake of the Flint water crisis.

“What I saw in Flint, Michigan, 

was one of the most unsettling and 
disturbing things that I have ever 
seen in my whole life,” Sanders 
said. “I do believe that the governor 
of this state should resign.”

Sanders 
began 
his 
speech 

focusing 
on 
differentiating 

himself in the Democratic race, 
attacking Clinton’s views on trade 
and countering a claim she made 
in Sunday’s Democratic debate 
that he did not support the auto 
industry bailout.

Sanders voted against funds for 

the bailout included in the larger 
Troubled Assets Relief Program, 
which also included mechanisms 
to bail out several large banks. He 
voted in favor of a different, smaller 
package of funds for automakers.

“That is absolutely false, there 

was one vote in the United States 
Senate, that would be on December 
11, 2008, and of course I voted to 
defend the auto bailout,” Sanders 
said. “What I did not vote for was 
a middle class bailout of the crooks 
on Wall Street”

He ended his speech in a similar 

manner, discussing his confidence 
as the Democratic nominee in 
defeating Republican frontrunner 
Donald Trump.

“We will win because the 

American people do not want a 
president who insults Mexicans 
and Muslims,” Sanders said. “The 
American people do not want a 
president who insults women. 
The American people do not 
want a president who insults 
African Americans … We will 
together defeat Trump because 
the American people understand 
that we need our people together 
— Trump’s divisiveness is dividing 
us up. The American people 
will defeat Trump because they 
understand that community — 
helping each other, standing with 
each other in our times of need 
trumps selfishness.”

After the speech, Sanders joined 

JR JR and Nate Ruess on stage to 
sing “This Land is Your Land,” 
one of several songs the candidate 
recorded in a 1987 folk album while 
serving as the mayor of Burlington, 
Vermont.

T

he Two Cultures theory is an idea 
born from scientist C. P. Snow that 
criticizes the British educational sys-

tem. His theory explains 
the clash between two 
opposing cultures — in 
his case, the arts and the 
sciences — and how their 
relationship was critical 
to adequate preparation 
for managing the modern 
world.

Snow 
was 
outraged 

that learning Greek or 
Latin 
overshadowed 

learning about the engi-
neering 
and 
scientific 

advances that were so critical to winning 
World War II in the classroom. He argued 
that countries like the United States and Ger-
many, which emphasized educating its stu-
dents in both the sciences and arts, gained 
competitive advantages.

Since the coining of the theory, this idea 

has taken on a life of its own. Some would 
argue that the theory creates a forced dichot-
omy that in reality does not exist. I disagree. 
I have experienced this dis-
tinct binary within the music 
industry.

Personally, I have heard 

animosity from record label 
executives about the dif-
fering perspectives of run-
ning a music company. On 
one hand, label veterans 
understand how to locate 
and develop talent. On the 
other hand, an outsider with 
a business degree may think 
differently about how to 
operate an efficient business 
model. The argument as to 
which perspective is better 
— music veterans or business savvy outsiders 
— is really the discussion of which “culture” 
should carry more weight.

In a speech in 2010, Steve Jobs explained 

that part of his philosophical view for Apple 
was that “technology alone is not enough 
— it’s technology married with liberal arts, 
married with the humanities, that yields us 
the results that make our heart sing.”

Jobs would argue, as would I, that both 

perspectives must exist in tandem.

For a long time, a sophisticated scientif-

ic culture did not exist prominently in the 
music industry, if at all. However, a growing 
curiosity toward applying the sciences — or 
at least data — has begun to emerge. The 
recent success of analytic companies like 

Next Big Sound will help to define a second 
culture in music. More advanced technolo-
gy and analysis should be embraced, rather 
than rejected, as streaming services have 
been previously. Streaming services have 
been attacked for their low royalty payouts 
and that still is a concern, but it shouldn’t 
dominate the perception of tech companies 
in music. They are doing a lot of good, too, 
by bringing data-oriented minds into the 
music world. Taylor Swift boycotting the 
streaming services makes for flashy head-
lines. Yet, Will Page, Spotify’s director of 
economics, is doing important work assess-
ing the impact of music festivals on local 
economies. And that should not go over-
looked.

South by Southwest, a music festival held 

in Austin, Texas, which has an artist lineup 
as diverse as its events, is a great example of 
how to intertwine these two cultures. The 
festival brings together hundreds of thou-
sands of visitors for a weekend of music per-
formances as well as technology and business 
conferences. At the most recent South by 
Southwest festival, economist Paul Krugman 
sat alongside other panelist discussing his 

notion of a new celeb-
rity economy for artists 
— the idea that artists 
no longer make money 
from selling music, but 
from 
capitalizing 
on 

their celebrity branding 
through licensing, tours, 
etc. It’s an interesting 
point that creates a com-
pelling picture for the 
future of music.

But this crossroads 

in Austin must ripple 
throughout the indus-
try. Labels and their 
artists should be keen-

ly aware of economists like Krugman and 
invested in the discussions occurring at 
conferences across the country. For the sake 
of the long-term vitality of the music indus-
try, the musicians and those promoting 
their work should be encouraged to think 
about innovations in big data and appreci-
ate their worth. And to their credit, some 
labels have been quite proactive in doing so. 
300 Entertainment developing talented art-
ists while building partnerships with tech 
companies paves the way for the rest of the 
music industry, and hopefully other indus-
tries, to follow suit.

Two cultures clashing

O

bjectivity is in many ways 
a myth — but this isn’t a 
novel thought. I think we 

all accept that 
no one can be 
truly objective 
in 
how 
they 

view a situa-
tion. But our 
lack of objec-
tivity goes even 
deeper 
since 

worldview 
is 

continually 
influenced 
by 

environment.

Monday 

night, I went to the Bernie Sanders 
Rally at Crisler Center. It was one 
of the most fun events I’ve attend-
ed recently — and I’m a Republi-
can.

The audience’s excitement was 

palpable and contagious. The vibe 
was simultaneously relaxed and 
passionate; the music bounced 
back and forth between chill 
instrumentals and hardcore rock 
songs about freedom.

I’ve been to several rallies as a 

volunteer and interned on several 
campaigns, but this was by far 
the youngest and most energetic 
crowd I’ve seen at a campaign 
rally. The two girls sitting next to 
me screamed like they were at a 
One Direction concert, and shout-
ed, “let’s go!” and “primaries, 
baby!” at various points through-
out the rally. The couple sitting 
in front of me showed their sup-
port while holding a pair of giant 
sound-blocking headphones over 
their baby’s ears.

While I don’t agree with his pol-

icies or self-proclaimed socialist 
ideology, the excitement Sanders 
has managed to generate makes 
perfect sense.

Sanders’ platform is filled with 

policies that promise a radical 
deviation from the status quo of 
American politics. Opening speak-
ers cited his promises to provide 
free college education and prevent 
manufacturing jobs from moving 
overseas by blocking free-trade 
agreements like the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership.

As countries in the global south 

liberalized their economies — in 
part due to pressure from the 

United States — millions of U.S. 
manufacturing jobs have moved 
overseas to countries where the 
market price for labor is consider-
ably lower. As high-paying manu-
facturing jobs that don’t require a 
college education become scarce, 
affording an education becomes 
both more difficult and more 
important. It also doesn’t help 
that the cost of college is rising for 
other reasons, and the Europeans 
get it for free.

On both the left and right, 

U.S. voters are responding with 
excitement to policies designed 
to remedy the perceived decline 
in American exceptionalism. Both 
Donald Trump and Sanders have 
invoked the idea that the U.S. 
is losing from free-trade agree-
ments.

On the right, rhetoric has been 

xenophobic and accusatory, blam-
ing migrant workers and Chinese 
currency manipulation for the 
anemic growth of the U.S. econo-

my. On the left, it has blamed capi-
talism and international trade for 
the same issue.

Capitalism is a logical target 

for Americans’ frustrations. After 
all, free trade really has allowed 
great jobs to move overseas, and 
this really has exacerbated income 
inequality. The only reason this 
is possible is because other coun-
tries transitioned to open-market 
economies.

But what the Sanders campaign 

fails to recognize is that global 
capitalism has lifted more than a 
billion people out of extreme pov-
erty in the last 20 years alone.

Sanders 
runs 
an 
egalitar-

ian campaign. But if promoting 
anti-trade policies that help U.S. 
union workers at the expense of 

the world’s poorest people isn’t 
American privilege, I don’t know 
what is. If the left is willing to sit 
back and throw stones at Trump’s 
racist rhetoric, then they should 
certainly be more critical of their 
own candidate’s policies that can 
only address domestic inequality 
at the expense of millions of peo-
ple around the world.

But I’ve gotten ahead of myself 

a bit, because Sanders’ policies 
aren’t really ready for that sort 
of serious analysis. The sort of 
changes Sanders promotes are 
far beyond the scope of anything 
a U.S. president can reasonably 
hope 
to 
accomplish 
unilater-

ally — or constitutionally. Given 
the recent Congressional grid-
lock and the fact that several U.S. 
entitlement programs are already 
systemically underfunded — I’m 
looking at you, social security — 
it seems unlikely that Congress 
would approve a plan to provide 
free college tuition. That’s simply 
not something that could happen 
via executive order.

I know that some of you read-

ing this are probably feeling the 
Bern. Maybe you were even one of 
the enthusiastic voters screaming 
at the rally. And I can see why you 
would.

Sanders promises change, and 

change is exciting. Obama excited 
voters by promising change, too. 
But it’s hard to point to any thrill-
ing shifts in U.S. policies from the 
past eight years. There’s an impor-
tant lesson in that fact — Ameri-
can policymaking is much more 
gradual and far less earth shat-
tering than election and campaign 
promises.

An 
adequate 
response 
to 

increasing 
competition 
from 

abroad and inequality at home 
cannot be derived by unrealistic 
campaign promises — no mat-
ter how exciting. We don’t need a 
socialist in the White House. We 
need a president who knows how 
to make global capitalism work 
more efficiently and equitably for 
Americans. Sanders is not that 
candidate.

Clinton 
has 
changed 
a 
tremendous 

amount throughout her political career, with 
extreme flip-flopping on social issues and 
a lack of transparency on this flip-flopping, 
until recently. This warrants hesitation in 
trusting Clinton to stay strong to her policies. 
However, we choose to believe her ability 
to grow and learn from her changes shows 
a productive, nuanced and detail-oriented 
approach to changes in policy that naturally 
reflect changes in our nation’s culture.

We watched Obama win the presidential 

election with a campaign promoting hope and 
optimism to the masses. And we have now 
watched eight years in which Obama worked 
tirelessly, and many times futility, to pass 
legislation on many of these hopes he had for 
our country. Though Sanders’ platform has 
this same hope and it is admirable, it is not 
realistic. Presidents have a day job beyond 
promoting a political-revolution rhetoric and 
Clinton has the policy agendas, experience 
and resources to be president.

***
In the Republican primary race, we find 

an atmosphere characterized by aggressive 
rhetoric that is racist, sexist, bigoted and 
lacking in any substantive stances on policies. 
Out of this mess, Ohio Governor John Kasich 
(R) has emerged as the most sensible option 
for Republican voters. With ample experience 
as a member of the House Budget Committee 
and governor of Ohio, Kasich has a track 
record of not just addressing policy issues, but 
working in tandem with Democrats to pass 
legislation.

Kasich has demonstrated his pragmatism 

in policies such as accepting the Medicaid 
expansion of Obamacare — something many 
Republican governors refused to do. He 
accepts the realities of manmade climate 
change, whereas other Republican candidates 
have refused to accept even the existence 
of global warming. He was influential in 
balancing federal budgets by collaborating 
with a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. 
As governor of a state with substantial 
ideological diversity, Kasich has been keen on 
approaching issues with practicality in mind.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 
governor, 
his 

relatively moderate views have gained him 
less than desirable polling results. The 
Republican voting bloc has contributed to 
candidates’ gradual shift alarmingly far to the 
right, to the point where the frontrunner is a 
self-avowed bigot. The two other candidates 
with the most delegates are darlings of the 
ultra-conservative Tea Party Movement. 
Kasich is proving to be the best out of several 
bad options.

Kasich is certainly not without his faults. 

In Ohio he is currently pushing for legislation 
that would defund Planned Parenthood — a 
critical provider of women’s health services 
beyond just abortion. He has also advocated 
the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a 
policy that would effectively strip the health 
coverage of millions. However, compared 
to the rest of the Republican slate, there is a 
stark difference between Kasich’s approach 
and those of his competitors. For Republican 
voters looking for someone who has not 
succumbed to the unfortunate state of affairs 
in the Republican presidential race, John 
Kasich is the only viable option. 

S

en. Bernie Sanders wants to 
cure society’s cancer. While 
he may have an uncanny 

ability to speak 
poetically about 
realigning 
the 

economic play-
ing field to bet-
ter enfranchise 
people 
of 
all 

classes, 
colors 

and creeds, he 
fails to recog-
nize that cancer 
is “a collection of 
related 
diseas-

es” driven by a 
diverse array of often confounding 
caustic variables — not a singular, 
static disease with one cause and 
one treatment. Though he certainly 
acknowledges the associations of 
racism, sexism and xenophobia, 
among others, with society’s can-
cer, his steadfast insistence that just 
fixing our rigged economy will cure 
us is a gross oversimplification.

Former Secretary of State Hill-

ary Clinton, on the other hand, 
takes a more dynamic and multi-
faceted view. Though she does not 
elicit the same excitement as Sand-
ers when addressing large crowds, 
her ability to examine and analyze 
problems through a variety of lens-
es is simultaneously remarkable 
and inspiring. She understands that 
society’s cancers have metastasized 
to a degree where one generalized 
solution will simply not cut it.

Clinton’s life story is one of resil-

ience in the face of (sometimes self-
inflicted) attacks on her integrity. 
She has stood up to a sexist status 
quo and continues to break down 

the barriers separating the assump-
tions about and expectations of 
people of all genders. Her resilience 
has the potential to resonate with 
millions of Americans who have 
overcome struggles with a steeled 
resolve to leave their children 
and grandchildren better off than 
themselves.

I do not mean to take any-

thing away from Sanders, who has 
brought an important issue to the 
forefront of public conversation, 
and is an excellent candidate to 
address the inequities pervasive 
in our current economic system. 
He has also successfully mobilized 
new and previously disenfran-
chised voters crucial for winning 
the White House in November.

Given the stakes of their cam-

paigns, it is not unreasonable to 
question both candidates’ qualifi-
cations, explore past accomplish-
ments and demand transparency 
about any inconsistencies.

While Sanders certainly says 

the right things, he is often unable 
to back up his statements with the 
concrete steps he would take as 
president to make change. He is not 
a single-issue candidate because 
he only talks about one issue; he is 
a single-issue candidate because 
he advocates the same solution to 
every problem.

Clinton, too, is not without her 

drawbacks. Though she could cer-
tainly be more transparent about 
her past missteps, her reluctance to 
do so represents the very human-
ity that she is often denied by her 
detractors. To expect someone 
who has spent her whole career 
being unfairly dismissed — often 

with arguments that fall outside 
the realm of logic and reason — to 
openly admit past mistakes, while 
a fair expectation in a presidential 
campaign, is also one that I expect 
to come to fruition as the campaign 
moves forwards.

I recognize the potential hypoc-

risy in my argument. I am cynical 
about the possibility of Sanders’ 
promises materializing, yet I am 
optimistic that Clinton will be more 
open to discussing the discrepan-
cies that cloud her past. This is in 
part because she has already start-
ed to do so.

Furthermore, I am more wor-

ried about the failure of Sanders’ 
planned 
political 
revolution 
— 

which I concede would be rather 
brilliant — than I am the effects of 
Clinton’s past on her ability to not 
only win the general election, but 
also to effectively govern the day 
she gets into office.

We have made real progress 

exposing and strategically dis-
mantling the multitude of malig-
nancies 
that 
inhabit 
various 

regions of our society over the past 
eight years. We need a president 
who can navigate through our 
complicated political landscape, 
starting not after a few years on 
the job, but on day one. 

Hillary 
Clinton’s 
breadth 
of 

knowledge, her experience chal-
lenging a rigged status quo and her 
ability to think about and address 
issues through more than one lens 
make her the best candidate for 
president in 2016.

‘Gods of Egypt’ is the 
good kind of terrible

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

Hey, you. Yeah, you. The person 

in the back who’s always bitching 
about how Hollywood movies 
aren’t original 
anymore. 
Oh, 

“everything’s 
a reboot or a 
sequel” 
this, 

“corporate 
cash-grab” 
that. It’s time 
for you to put 
your 
money 

where 
your 

mouth 
is 

and pony up 
for “Gods of 
Egypt,” the most original film of 
the year. And guess what? This 
commercial and critical failure is 
almost worth watching for a num-
ber of reasons. Bear with me.

For nearly every second of this 

movie, I couldn’t believe what I 
was seeing happen onscreen. Not 
because the effects are convinc-
ing or the action awe-inspiring — 
certainly, neither is the case — but 
because I was repeatedly shocked 
at the amount of CGI-drenched 
lunacy that is packed into each 
frame of the picture.

I’m supposed to summarize 

the plot for you, but where do I 
even begin? This is a movie about 
shredded 10-foot-tall God-bros 
(Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, “Game 
of Thrones,” and Gerard Butler, 
“300”) with gold blood that turn 
into giant robot eagles and fight 
with laser beams. They hang out 
with scantily-clad babes and have 

shiny crystal organs that they can 
take out like Lego pieces. But it’s 
also a buddy movie? And a road 
movie? And there’s a 15-minute 
break in the middle to show a 
scene where Ra (Geoffrey Rush, 
“Pirates of the Caribbean”) drags 
the sun, held by giant chain, 
around the FLAT, DISC-SHAPED 
EARTH (I’m sure Tila Tequila 
and B.o.B. will love this movie), 
and then fights a giant shadow-
leviathan thing to make sure it 
doesn’t eat reality?

Oh, what a mess. What a 

strange, fascinating mess. One of 
my favorite gaming websites gives 
out a “Hottest Mess” award at the 
end of every year — if we did that 
at The Michigan Daily, “Gods of 
Egypt” would be a shoo-in. Every 
shot in “Gods of Egypt” feels like 
it had its own director and cin-
ematographer, coordinating their 
craftsmanship over a laggy Skype 
call. I’ve seen bad CGI before, but 
it’s been a while since I’ve seen 
CGI this egregiously bad. But I 
can’t look away, and I don’t want 
to. Some of this stuff — a few 
“Raiders of the Lost Ark” rip-off 
scenes, some Power Rangers-style 
fight scenes — is a whole lot of fun.

I’ve been trying to figure out a 

good film comparison to ground 
this review in something familiar, 
but “Gods of Egypt” honestly feels 
like no other film I’ve seen. Per-
haps the closest thing to it is the 
“Clash of the Titans” franchise, 
but “Gods of Egypt” is much more 
visually 
interesting, 
imagina-

tive and all over the place. Plus, it 
lacks Sam Worthington, which is 
always a plus.

Really, “Gods of Egypt” is much 

more like a video game. It reminds 
me most of “Bayonetta” and “God 
of War,” violent character action 
games in which oversexualized 
deities slice and dice mythological 
creatures within a vaguely reli-
gious conflict.

I truly appreciate the creativity 

that went into “Gods of Egypt.” 
It’s evident writer/director Alex 
Proyas (“I, Robot”) had extraor-
dinarily ambitious ideas and was 
assisted in establishing a solid 
vision by a really terrific team 
of concept artists. But there’s a 
tinge of disinterested incompe-
tence that drags “Gods of Egypt” 
through the dirt before it shows 
up to the prom. With terrible 
accents and lackadaisical deliv-
ery, Gerard Butler and Chadwick 
Boseman (“Get On Up”) clearly 
don’t give a shit about their perfor-
mance any time they’re onscreen. 
The trying-too-hard jokes fail to 
get laughs much more often than 
they succeed. Several of the main 
Egyptian characters are embar-
rassingly cast mayonnaise-white. 
And as I said, the CGI is dated 
and messy, seemingly worked on 
by a multitude of uncoordinated 
effects houses.

Despite these cringe-inducing 

elements, I can almost see “Gods 
of Egypt” becoming a cult film 
over the next few years. Perhaps 
it’s saying something about Hol-
lywood’s tendency to reuse and 
recycle that I found such an incom-
petently structured (and way too 
long, by the way) film so enjoyable. 
It’s frustrating how nearly recom-
mendable this film is.

FILM REVIEW
‘Mustang’ gallops 
with gentle realism

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Last Sunday, “Mustang” — 

the first film from Turkish-
French director Deniz Gamze 
Ergüven 
— 

narrowly 
lost 

the Oscar for 
best 
foreign 

film to Hun-
garian 
Holo-

caust 
drama 

“Son of Saul.” 
If that was the first you’ve 
heard of “Mustang,” it won’t be 
the last.

Though heralded as the Turk-

ish “Virgin Suicides,” “Mus-
tang” shares only its structure, 
not its substance, with Coppo-
la’s cult classic. The film follows 
five orphaned sisters growing 
up in a coastal Turkish town 
who, after a neighbor sees them 
playing with male classmates 
on the beach, are imprisoned 
in their grandmother’s home to 
preserve their marriageability. 
However, as the title might sug-
gest, “Mustang” is full of a wild-
ness and passion that allows it 
to both lament the girls’ cap-
tivity and commend their resil-
ience.

The girls function as a sort of 

collective unit, each one more 
or less representative of the 
whole — with the exception of 
Lale (Günes Sensoy), the young-
est sister and the film’s narra-

tor. It is her rebelliousness and 
energy that seems to set much 
of the film in motion. Her love 
of soccer sends the girls on their 
largest rebellion: a secret outing 
to an all-female soccer game. 
She is the audience surrogate 
— through her eyes we see the 
movie and feel her anxiety and 
restlessness.

Ergüven crafts her film with 

a gentleness that allows the 
space the girls inhabit to be 
both beautiful and oppressive. 
Shots full of lush greenery and 
golden sunlight stand in bril-
liant contrast to the coldness 
and severity with which the 
girls’ lives are handled.

Similarly, despite its nega-

tive portrayals of marriage, 
“Mustang” is full of love. The 
girls love each other with an 
unrivaled fierceness. Beacons 
of hope outside the family, like 
Yasin and Lale’s teacher, love 
the girls and help them find a 
world full of hope.

That isn’t to say that “Mus-

tang” is a beautiful, rose-col-

ored cry for help. The girls 
are not manic angels awaiting 
rescue. They are not passive 
or quiet. They are fierce and 
independent. The walls close in 
on them because they push out 
against them.

Likewise, Ergüven does not 

hold back on the social commen-
tary. The oppression of women, 
especially young women, and 
the unfaltering fascination with 
their purity is at the forefront. 
Their sin was not playing on 
the beach with boys, but rather 
their sin was being born girls. 
Their most important feature 
is their marriageability. Their 
sin of femininity can only be 
absolved once they are tied for-
ever to a man.

And while it might be easy 

to dismiss this world as being 
completely Turkish (as a way to 
say it is completely not Ameri-
can), Ergüven crafts it in a way 
that makes it universal. The 
girls, as much as they func-
tion as individual forces, also 
function as representatives of 
all girls, all young women who 
are held back by walls literal or 
figurative.

This is how “Mustang” tran-

scends its labels as a “Turkish 
‘Virgin Suicides’” or a “modern 
‘Pride & Prejudice.’” It becomes 
something 
wholly 
its 
own, 

belonging as much to its cast and 
crew as it does to every girl who 
has ever yearned for freedom.

TV REVIEW
‘Mavis!’ explores the 
influential chanteuse

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“I’ll stop singing when I have 

nothing left to say … and you 
know, that ain’t gonna happen.”

This is one 

of 
the 
first 

lines 
in 
the 

new 
HBO 

Documentary 
Films produc-
tion, and it sets 
the tone for 
the rest of the 
film. “Mavis!”, 
which 
pre-

miered Feb. 29 
on HBO, is a semi-biographical 
look at the career and influence 
of Mavis Staples, a soul and 
gospel singer and civil rights 
activist whose 60-year career 
shaped the music and mood of 
the 1960s and beyond. A typi-
cal documentary in form and 
length, “Mavis!” relies on the 
spark of its subject to propel it 
along.

Mavis began performing in 

earnest once her father heard 
her sing and realized they could 
make a family career out of it. 
Her recounting of her child-
hood is heartwarming; when 
people heard her for the first 
time, they didn’t believe it was 
a little girl. “ ‘That’s got to be a 
man or a big fat woman,’ ” she 
laughs, quoting them. “ ‘That’s 
not a little girl.’ ” The first time 
she ever got an encore, she 

didn’t know what that word 
meant — and because she had 
only prepared one song, she 
repeated it twice.

She became the lead singer 

of the Staple Singers when she 
was just a teenager; she and 
her father, “Pops” Staples, were 
the only constant performers 
through the history of the band. 
Their style was a blend unlike 
anything else being produced 
at the time; it fit into the pat-
tern of popular gospel music, 
but it drew from the kind of 
music played in the 1920s. The 
strongest material of the docu-
mentary is found in the footage 
of Mavis’s performances, both 
from her past in the Staple Sing-
ers and as a solo artist later on.

By the time someone remarks 

in the documentary that Sta-
ples’s career has lasted as long 
as the Rolling Stones’ — and 
had as much influence — it isn’t 
hard to believe, though she isn’t 
as well-known in popular cul-
ture as other gospel singers. 
At one point, Staples casually 
mentions how Bob Dylan wasn’t 
just a fan of the Staple Sing-
ers, but wanted to marry her. 
It’s throwaway statements like 
this that remind us how rich a 
career Staples has had, adding 
a layer of touching depth to the 
documentary.

“Mavis!” takes some time 

getting to the civil rights por-
tion of her story, but once it gets 
there, the documentary picks 

up steam. Staples talks about 
how she started performing 
“freedom songs” after experi-
encing the influence of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. One of the 
most mesmerizing segments is 
her account of watching little 
children attempt to board a bus 
during the integration of pub-
lic schools in Little Rock; that 
experience is reflected in her 
music.

“Any freedom song that we 

wrote was because of the move-
ment,” Staples says.

The warm, rich footage of 

her provocative music is com-
pelling, both artistically and in 
the messages that, as she points 
out, are still relatable.

“Mavis!” feels longer than it 

is; it’s a relatively quiet film for 
such a powerful subject. It’s not 
a hypnotizing piece of work, 
but it does justice to its subject, 
and Mavis herself is delight-
ful to listen to. The confidence 
she displays in her powerhouse 
vocal performances is mir-
rored in the longer interview 
segments; you can’t help but 
believe what she says. Toward 
the end of the documentary, she 
reiterates the sentiments with 
which she opened.

“I’ll sing until I can’t sing 

anymore,” she says, laughing. “ 
... and if ya’ll don’t see me here 
singin’, look for me in heaven. 
Somewhere, 
I’ll 
be 
walkin’ 

those streets of gold, singin’ 
round God’s throne.”

“

No, I don’t think there is 
a ‘Caine Prize Aesthet-
ic,’” NoViolet Bulawayo 

responded during a recent Q&A 
in the University of Michigan’s 
Hopwood 
Room.

This isn’t 

surprising to 
hear. In 2011, 
Bulawayo 
won the 
Caine Prize 
for African 
Writing, an 
annual liter-
ary award 
for African 
original 
stories, for her story “Hitting 
Budapest.” The story is the 
first chapter of her novel, “We 
Need New Names.” Along with 
the award and 10,000 pounds, 
the winner also often accepts 
the stigma of the “Caine Prize 
aesthetic” — the idea that the 
authors are conforming to 
pre-existing notions that the 
Western world, and the Western 
judges, have about Africa.

In the Q&A, Bulawayo, who 

moved to America from Zimba-
bwe as a young adult, went on to 
describe the ways in which win-
ning the Caine Prize bolstered 
her confidence in her ability 
to write and sell a full-length 
novel. But can we take her word 
as a winner and beneficiary of 
the prize that an aesthetic does 
not exist?

I don’t think we can. This is 

nothing against Bulawayo — 
she’s an engaging intellectual, 
and “We Need New Names” is 
a fantastic book. But both her 
story and its form in her novel 
comply with stereotypical ideas 
of poverty and brutality in 
Zimbabwe. This is where I get 
lost contemplating the Caine 
Prize. Bulawayo’s novel is both 

incredibly well-written and 
an opportunity for a voice that 
would normally be silenced to 
be heard, a chance we cannot 
take for granted. But her themes 
of incest, starvation and child 
neglect play into our ideas of 
a place we’ve never seen. Our 
construction of Africa is pieced 
together from sensationalist 
journalism and a lack of the 
consideration for the ethnic 
and geographic diversity of the 
continent.

The Caine Prize, dubbed 

the “African Man Booker,” has 
increasingly come under fire for 
catering to the Western world 
at the expense of the literary 
independence of the authors. In 
2015, Zambian writer Namwali 
Serpell won the prize for her 
story “The Sack,” a nuanced and 
enigmatic narrative of the rela-
tionship between two men who 
love the same woman. (If you 
want to read the story, set aside 
an hour or two of your time. 
It’s not long, but the confusing 
nature of the structure lends 
itself to rewarding new discov-
eries every time you reread it.)

Serpell’s triumph in win-

ning the prize struck the liter-
ary world as unusual for two 
reasons. One: an author from 
Zambia had never won the prize 
before. In the fifteen years of 
the Caine Prize, the winners 
have been overwhelmingly from 
Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and 
South Africa, with some excep-
tions of Sudan, Uganda and 
Sierra Leone. The recent influx 
of winners from countries with 
less established ties to Western 
literature reflects the growing 
diversity of the prize between 
nations. The second reason 
might change the course of the 
prize forever. Serpell accepted 
the prize and immediately 
announced that she would be 
sharing the 10,000 pound prize 
with her fellow shortlisted 
writers. Serpell later described 
this to BBC Newsday as “an act 
of mutiny …” It’s awkward to 
be placed into this position of 
competition with other writers 
that you respect immensely and 
get put into a sort of “American 
Idol” or racehorse situation 
when actually you all just want 
to support each other.”

Binyavanga Wainaina, win-

ner of the Caine Prize in 2002 
and LGBT activist in his home 
country of Kenya, has also 
spoken out against the burden 
of the prize. Wainaina took to 
Twitter, directly calling out 
the prize, saying, “Caine Prize! 
10,000 dollars and never ask 
questions, coz literary intel-
lectuals shld never be uncer-
tain about who Rules African 
literature.” Perhaps due to the 
democratizing nature of the 
Internet, writers are feeling 
more at ease coming out with 
their dissatisfaction about the 
nature of the prize.

I recently had the oppor-

tunity to listen to Shadreck 
Chikoti, a Malawian writer 
who came to the University as 
part of the Zell Visiting Writ-
ers series. Chikoti, who writes 
in both English and Chichewa, 
was selected to attend the Caine 
Prize African Writers’ Work-
shop in Cameroon in 2011, and 
his story “Child of a Hyena” was 
published in the Caine Prize 
2011 anthology. And yet, when 
asked about his time working 
in conjunction with the prize, 
Chikoti said that in some ways 
the prize went against “how 
much I believe in the liberty 
of an author … in people writ-
ing whatever they want.” He 
expressed the pressure he felt 
from officials to write a story 
about stereotypes and tradi-
tions of Malawi, rather than 
letting ideas naturally come. 
But Chikoti recently broke from 
the social construction of what 
African writers can and cannot 
write, in his publication of the 
science fiction novel “Azotus 
the Kingdom.”

Namwali Serpell, after win-

ning the prize, spoke similarly 
of these pressures and of people 
asking questions like “Are you 
an African writer? What is Afri-
ca and its life?” The problems 
we have with the Caine Prize

The 1975 ages like a 
fine wine on ‘Sleep’

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

Variety is the spice of life, and 

The 1975, with its funky electron-
ic rhythms and lead singer Matt 
Healy’s 
even 

funkier 
hair, 

know all about 
spicing things 
up. 
With 
17 

tracks, 
their 

new album, I 
Like It When 
You Sleep, for 
You 
Are 
So 

Beautiful 
Yet 

So Unaware of 

It, is as long-winded as its title 
and could have easily fallen prey 
to repetition and flat, consistent 
songs. Instead, The 1975 push the 
bright and bold LED aesthetic it 
is known for; every song in this 
album bursts with uniqueness, 
zealousness and vitality. It’s a 
mess, but it’s an endearing mess, 
with The 1975 unashamedly 
unconcerned with its strange 
conglomeration of songs.

Of course, The 1975 isn’t one to 

shy away from ambition, consid-
ering its first formidable 16-track 
self-titled album. It was on this 
album that The 1975 created its 
offbeat yet sensational pop-punk 
sound through songs like “The 
City,” “Chocolate” and “Girls.” A 
mixture of Healy’s endearingly 
unguarded vocals and a (slightly 
off-tempo) blunt and eclectic 
beat established the band as hav-
ing a sound that was distinctively 
its own. With its first album, The 
1975 not only lit a space for itself 
in the music industry with blind-
ing, neon lights but also made a 
promise to come back in a way 
that both kept its idiosyncratic 
music alive and pushed the label 
of its creativity. 

I Like It When You Sleep, 

for You Are So Beautiful Yet So 
Unaware of It carries out that 
promise and more. The album is 
an assorted mix of homages to 
the past and salutes to the explo-
ration of the future. The surface-
level electronica dance hits clash 
with the bone-deep, heavy beats 
of mournful ballads to conjure 
an album that is some parts old, 
some parts new and all parts 
incredible. 

The new album begins with 

the self-titled “The 1975,” a 
complete parallel to their first 
album’s opening track, also self-
titled “The 1975.” Both songs in 
the two different albums sound 
so similar they might as well be 
the same song. Hearing the soft, 
dulcet chorus over a rising melo-
dy repeat itself in this new album 
is comforting and creates a con-
nection between past and pres-
ent. The album then transitions 
into “Love Me,” a light-hearted 
celebration of former renowned 
songs such as “Chocolate” and 
“Girls.” “Love Me” (just like 
its predecessors in The 1975) is 
jaunting and weird. The unpre-
dictable beat in the background 
almost has as much animation 
as Matt Healy’s voice, as he sings 
“and love me / if that’s what you 
want to do.” However, instead 
of being unsettling, the song’s 
surreal sound mimics the sound 
of The 1975’s entire first album. 
Much like this album’s first track, 

“Love Me” is captivating not in 
its strangeness, but in its famil-
iarity.

Slowly, through songs like 

“Love Me,” and later on, “UGH!” 
and “She’s American,” The 1975 
guides its listeners through an 
album that starts off recognizable 
but slowly veers into experimen-
tal. This beginning familiar-
ity helps prevent the album from 
becoming distant as a result of an 
overwhelming number of songs 
that push the boundaries of The 
1975’s usual sound. Instead, 
through subtle R&B influences, 
songs like “If I Believe You” and 
“Loving Someone” help add 
depth and appeal. Smooth and 
slow, “If I Believe You” oozes sex 
appeal; through “and if I believe 
you, would that make it stop / 
if I told you I need you, is that 
what you want?” Healy’s voice 
conjures up images of soft sunset 
beaches and dimly lit rooms as it 
crawls out of the speakers. “Lov-
ing Someone” is somewhat simi-
lar, with the ambient “yeah, you 
should be loving someone / oh, 
oh, loving someone” of the cho-
rus contradicting the quick and 
direct vocals of the verses. Both 
these songs are enthralling in 
their novelty and keep the album 
itself from becoming flat. 

However, the best moments on 

I Like It When You Sleep, for You 
Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware 
of It are on songs that are quietly 
simple. With a band whose music 
has such an intense presence, 
songs like the title track, “Nana” 
and “She Lays Down” shine in 
their unobtrusiveness. The title 
track is entirely instrumental, 
with a tranquil driving beat that 
makes the entire song twinkle 
like fairy lights. Both “Nana” 
and “She Lays Down” finish the 
album off with softly acous-
tic guitar strums. The minimal 
background noise of these two 
songs helps bring the vocals front 
and center. Healy’s melodious 
singing voice signs the album off 
with a gentle flourish. 

Overall, I Like It When You 

Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful 
Yet So Unaware of It reads like 
an older sibling of The 1975’s 
first album. It is similar in many 
aspects and holds much of the 
same winning qualities, but it’s 
inherently more mature. The 
1975 felt comfortable in experi-
menting with music that might 
be hard to jive with, but they hold 
their own, standing dauntlessly 
with the album. This album 
proves that, right alongside wine 
and cheese, The 1975 can be 
added to the list of things that 
age with grace. 

POLYDOR

We like it when you have long album titles, for you are so pretentious yet so unaware of it.

FILM REVIEW
‘Triple 9’ doesn’t 
bring the thrills

New action film is 
just an exercise in 
hyper-masculinity.

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

What is the purpose of a 

thriller? Is it to attain some per-
verse sense of entertainment 
— 
cinematic 

schaden-
freude? What-
ever the reason 
we have tra-
ditionally val-
ued the crime 
thriller genre, 
“Triple 9” tests 
our dedication 
to it. The film, directed by John 
Hillcoat 
(“Lawless”), 
offers 

viewers two hours of visual tor-
ture. It’s a film so brutal and 
visceral that by the end, one 
feels as if watching a Tarantino 
movie would lighten the mood.

“Triple 9” follows a group 

of criminals and corrupt cops 
who decide to kill a new police 
officer so they can carry out a 
large heist on behalf of a Rus-
sian mafia boss, led by Irina 
Vlaslov (played by a steely Kate 
Winslet, “Steve Jobs”). The 
film boasts some pretty good 
acting performances. Chiwetel 
Ejiofor (“12 Years a Slave”) and 
Aaron Paul (“Breaking Bad”) 
both deliver reliably good per-
formances as two dark, slight-

ly 
maniacal 
criminals, 
and 

Anthony Mackie (“The Hurt 
Locker”), playing a two-timing 
cop, makes the best of a limited 
script. Casey Affleck (“Ocean’s 
Eleven”) and Woody Harrel-
son (“True Detective”) deliver 
performances that play to their 
strengths, or perhaps their 
career stereotypes.

Thrillers generally fall into 

two camps: they either use mys-
tery to build tension and sus-
pense until a climactic action 
sequence, 
or 
they 
surprise 

their audience by constructing 
a peaceful scene that quickly 
becomes mired in violence. 
“Triple 9” awkwardly straddles 
the two. The score by Atticus 
Ross (“The Social Network”) 
feels almost repetitive, as if he 
created only two or three tracks 
for the entire movie. The edit-
ing by Dylan Tichenor (“There 
Will Be Blood”), who is usually 
at the top of his game, never lets 
us linger on a face for too long, 
keeping us on edge yet never 
quite achieving the tension that 
elevates a good film to a great 
one.

But more than anything else, 

it’s the writing that hampers 
the film. Situated somewhere 
between a crime thriller, family 
drama and body horror, the film 
just doesn’t know where it wants 
to go. It has little to no point or 
purpose, other than to provide 
entertainment. That alone is 
not a problem. In fact, it’s quite 
the opposite; too often, films 

try to have a point when they 
really shouldn’t. But “Triple 9” 
is so brutal and violent that it 
couldn’t just stand by itself as 
a piece of entertainment. It’s a 
thriller that just doesn’t thrill 
as much as it should. “Triple 
9” also suffers from confusing 
what information it should and 
should not reveal. A critical 
storyline gets lost in the action 
sequences, yet the identities of 
the two-timing police officers 
are revealed in the first scene. 
The final moments of the film 
suggest that Hillcoat and writer 
Matt Cook were more inter-
ested simply in the concept of 
a Triple 9, the police code for 
a death of a police officer, than 
a good story that involved one. 
And, admittedly, the code does 
have a nice ring to it, but that’s 
no excuse to spend money and 
two hours of one’s time.

Further, the film seems to be 

more of an exercise in hyper-
masculinity than an attempt 
to tell. Like a cinematic dick-
measuring contest, each scene 
seems like an attempt to be 
more masculine than the scene 
before. Pointless drug use? 
Check. Pointless nudity, includ-
ing a scene in more-graphical-
ly-depicted-than-normal strip 
club? Check. Profanity flies as 
frequently as the bullets. And 
of course, this is not always a 
problem; if the world of the film 
calls for these sorts of charac-
ters, it’s appropriate. But for 
“Triple 9,” it’s utterly pointless.

Wolverines cruise to 
another 3-1 weekend

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan water polo 

team again played a four-game 
tournament after rising in the 
national poll and again proved 
to coach Marcelo Leonardi that 
his vision for the program is 
paying off in his second season.

“Honestly, 
I 
think 
we’re 

overachieving,” 
Leonardi 

said. “Going from year one 
to year two, we’ve definitely 
overachieved. There were some 
games that I thought we would 
be close to winning, but in order 
to say that we would be this 
good right now, it’s definitely 
humbling.”

This weekend, the Wolverines 

hosted four games at Canham 
Natatorium, knocking off No. 21 
Long Beach State, 15-8, and No. 
15 Loyola Marymount, 12-11, on 
Saturday. That set up a Sunday 
rematch with No. 2 UCLA, 
which defeated Michigan for 
the third time this season, 9-5.

But 
the 
Wolverines 

recovered and trounced George 
Washington, 19-2, continuing 
their roll and securing a third 
straight 3-1 weekend. After 
ranking No. 12 in the preseason 
poll — tied with conference foe 
Indiana — Michigan (16-5) came 
in at No. 5 last week and should 
remain there this week.

Leonardi arrived last season 

and led his team to a 19-13 
finish, 
but 
the 
Wolverines 

couldn’t manage to earn their 
first NCAA Tournament bid 
since 2010. This year, that goal 
is more within reach. Leonardi 
fashioned a difficult schedule 
for Michigan, with the first 20 
games coming against ranked 
teams.

That competition has put the 

Wolverines in a position for an 
at-large bid — that is, if they don’t 
win the California Water Polo 
Association championship and 
snag the automatic bid. Leonardi 
believes that at this point, his 
team is in good position for one 

or the other, provided it takes 
care of business in conference 
play starting April 2.

After 
two 
important 

weekends 
on 
the 
road 
in 

California, Michigan returned 
home, where it is now 7-1 this 
season. Leonardi credited the 
typical aspects of home — such 
as players sleeping in their 
own beds, seeing their family 
and having friends come to the 
games — for the success.

Against Long Beach State, 

the Wolverines pulled away 
with seven straight goals in 
the first half that provided the 
final margin of victory. Loyola 
Marymount 
proved 
tougher 

in a game that featured seven 
ties and five lead changes, but 
Michigan 
prevailed 
despite 

giving up a goal with five 
seconds left that trimmed the 
deficit back to one.

“The 
word 
‘resiliency’ 

definitely comes up, but I also 
gotta say composure,” Leonardi 
said. “In the most critical times, 
we have great leadership in the 

water, and I feel like the game 
slows down for them.”

Even with two wins under 

their 
belts, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines couldn’t upset the 
high-powered 
Bruins. 
While 

Michigan has made progress 
over the past year, Leonardi 
thinks his team is just short in 
terms of personnel — UCLA 
goes 12 players deep, while the 
Wolverines only have nine or 10 
at that level.

“I feel we’re one piece away,” 

Leonardi 
said. 
“Talent-wise, 

they’re just a little bit further 
ahead, and that has a lot to do 
with the fact that they’ve been 
a juggernaut for so many years.”

Michigan is off for two 

of the next three weekends, 
with a four-game tournament 
at Arizona State in between. 
Three of those games will be 
against ranked teams, but the 
Wolverines are currently the 
highest-rated of all of them. 
Their standing is a reward for 
the success, and with each 
weekend, it keeps building.

Marcelo Leonardi has Michigan ranked No. 5 nationally in his second season.

Michigan splits in Texas

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

tennis team wasn’t firing on all 
cylinders over Spring Break as 
it split its series in Texas last 
week. Despite the less than ideal 
performance, the Wolverines 
are happy with where they are 
as the beginning of Big Ten play 
draws nearer.

“I think we are in good 

shape,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein after Saturday’s 
match. “You know this one 
today, even Baylor, I don’t know 
that we played our best, (we 
were) a little passive at times at 
some spots. As a whole, I don’t 
know if we’ve had all six kids 
playing their best at the same 
time, and that’s what it’s going 
to take every time we go out on 
the court.”

Michigan 
defeated 
Baylor 

on Thursday in a close match, 
4-2, but the team was unable to 
complete a comeback against 
Texas on Saturday, ultimately 
falling 4-3. 

Against the Longhorns, the 

Wolverines found themselves 
behind the eight ball early after 
losing the doubles point. The No. 
1 pairing of freshman Kate Fahey 

and senior Ronit Yurovsky and 
a the No. 3 team of freshman 
Teona Velehorschi and junior 
Sara Remynse lost to Texas, 6-3 
and 7-6, respectively.

In singles play, the Wolverines 

made a push to turn the match 
around with wins from Fahey, 
Velehorschi and sophomore Alex 
Najarian. However, the marquee 
match of the day came at the No. 
1 position, where Michigan’s 
top player — No. 17 Yurovsky — 
fell to No. 9 Breaunna Addison 
in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. Texas 
finally clinched the match at the 
No. 3 slot, where Dani Wagland 
defeated 
sophomore 
Mira 

Ruder-Hook in three sets.

Thursday at Baylor, Michigan 

started the match off strong, 
taking the doubles point behind 
wins by the pairings of Najarian 
and Ruder-Hook, and Remynse 
and Velehorschi, 7-5 and 6-3, 
respectively.

The No. 2 through No. 4 

singles positions produced wins 
for the Wolverines en route to 
an overall victory, and Najarian 
clinched the match for Michigan 
with a three-set victory over 
Kiah Generette.

After starting the season cold, 

Najarian has turned up her play 
for the Wolverines lately. Her 

two singles wins over Spring 
Break give her three straight 
victories, and Michigan will 
be looking for her good form to 
continue.

“I think it’s just she’s getting 

more matches under her belt,” 
Bernstein said. “She didn’t play 
in the fall, (she’s) just getting 
her confidence back. The thing 
about (Najarian) is she’s going 
to compete really hard. It’s what 
she does. She cares about our 
team. She won both matches 
today and was upset after the 
match. You can tell that she 
really cared.”

Freshman 
Brienne 
Minor, 

who has totaled 21 wins this 
season, missed both matches 
for the Wolverines with a minor 
injury. According to Bernstein, 
there was a possibility for Minor 
to take part in the match against 
the Longhorns, but they decided 
to err on the side of caution, 
though she will be ready for 
Michigan’s next match against 
Virginia on Saturday.

“We’ll be fine,” Bernstein 

said. “It’s disappointing, and 
sometimes these losses you learn 
from and I hope they do. (These 
losses) should hurt. Virginia is 
not going to get any easier, that’s 
for sure.”

SAMII STOLOFF/Daily

Sophomore Alex Najarian has now won three straight matches, including two against Texas and Baylor.

The clock is ticking for Michigan hockey
T

he floodlight shone 
down from the rafters 
onto Nick Schilkey, 

christening 
the Buckeyes’ 
overtime hero 
who had just 
handed the 
Michigan 
hockey team 
its second 
loss of the 
weekend 
against Ohio 
State.

Schilkey’s 

goal came on a broken play, after 
Michigan senior goaltender 
Steve Racine made two saves that 
seemingly kept the Wolverines’ 
hope of a victory alive. But after 
the second rebound, Racine 
left the net in a footrace with 
Schilkey to clear the puck.

The Ohio State junior beat 

Racine to the spot and buried the 
puck into the net past a pair of 
sprawling Michigan players.

As the Buckeyes celebrated on 

the ice, the Wolverines laid in the 
same spot Schilkey had left them 
— hanging their heads, collapsed 
on their knees, helplessly watching 
Ohio State celebrate a weekend it 
had no business winning.

The fact is, this wasn’t a fluke. 

Ohio State outplayed Michigan 
this weekend — not in every facet 
of the game, but the sixth-ranked 
Wolverines were outplayed 
nonetheless.

But losing isn’t the real issue. 

You can’t expect a team to be 
perfect. After all, every team that 
sits above Michigan (10-5-3-2 
Big Ten, 20-7-5 overall) in the 
PairWise Rankings — with the 
exception of Quinnipiac — has 
five or more losses.

And losing to opponents you 

should beat on paper isn’t the 
real issue either.

No. 5 Boston College lost 

to both New Brunswick (in 

an exhibition) and Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute early 
in the season. No. 1 North 
Dakota dropped a game against 
Wisconsin in November and No. 
3 St. Cloud State lost to Colorado 
College in January.

I can’t curse here, so let me 

put it this way: In college hockey, 
fecal matter happens.

The real issue is that the 

Wolverines have yet to establish 
an identity.

The sweep at the hands of the 

Buckeyes has made that issue 
even more pressing. Michigan is 
now tasked with getting up off its 
knees and finding its identity. But 
there isn’t much time, with only 
one series against Penn State 
separating the team from the Big 
Ten and NCAA Tournaments.

The most concerning part of 

this predicament is that there 
have been stretches when the 
Wolverines seemed to establish 
their calling card, when the 
pieces come within centimeters 
of completing the puzzle.

But at those junctures, when 

fans yearn for a “ta-da!” moment, 
there always seems to be a 
weekend that pulls those pieces 
farther apart.

Just look at the winning 

stretch Michigan put together in 
February, when the Wolverines 
seemed to put any concerns 
about an identity crisis out of 
question. They barreled through 
their opponents and went on a 
five-game undefeated tear from 
Feb. 6 through Feb. 25.

Racine was playing the best 

hockey of his life, and the defense 
was finally up to speed with an 
offense that has been producing 
historic numbers.

The Wolverines capped off 

the run with a commanding win 
against Minnesota that put them 
in the driver’s seat for the Big 
Ten regular season title.

But only a day after taking 

the wheel, Michigan let it go, 
swallowing a 3-2 overtime loss 
against the Golden Gophers.

That’s when you started to 

wonder if the Wolverines’ identity 
was being turned on its head.

Then the two recent defeats 

against the Buckeyes provided a 
stronger case that it had.

Those losses were ugly. Friday, 

Michigan squandered an early 
two-goal lead at home and 
allowed Ohio State to score six 
unanswered goals.

Sunday didn’t get much better, 

as the Buckeyes scored three 
consecutive goals in the first and 
led 5-1 for most of the second 
period.

And in both games, there were 

stretches when the Wolverines 
looked lost, searching for 
something to grasp onto that 
could pull them back into 
contention.

That’s the most troubling part. 

Yes, the teams above Michigan 
in the PairWise Rankings have 
losses, and bad ones at that, 
but they also have a blueprint 
to follow when the cards seem 
stacked against them.

When the Wolverines get to 

the NCAA Tournament, they will 
see that first hand.

Boston College’s defense is 

fourth in the nation. St. Cloud 
State has the second-best power 
play in college hockey. No. 
2 Quinnipiac and No. 7 Yale 
both sit atop the country in the 
penalty kill, and North Dakota 
does it all, ranking in the top 10 
in both team defense and team 
offense.

And if Michigan doesn’t have 

it all figured out when those 
matchups come its way in March, 
it could quickly get bullied out of 
contention.

The Wolverines’ search for 

an identity like those of its 
powerhouse counterparts has 
been an inconsistent process. As 

Michigan coach Red Berenson 
put it after Sunday’s loss, “We’re 
saying one thing and doing 
another on the ice.”

The Wolverines can say they 

need to improve the defense, 
which they do, but the stark 
reality is that given the season’s 
sample size, they simply won’t 
shut out opponents. Their 
defense isn’t at that level, and 
they don’t have the time to get 
there either.

Finding what they have been 

looking for all season may be 
as simple as not ignoring the 
obvious. Michigan leads the 
nation with 4.72 goals per game. 
No team has scored at that rate 
since the 1999-2000 season.

What’s so wrong with 

embracing that? When Michigan 
tries to “play better defense,” it 
adopts a conservative approach 

in the defensive zone that looks 
like the Wolverines are trying to 
fit a square peg in a round hole. 
That’s not who they are, and they 
shouldn’t pretend it is.

But when they embrace this 

historic offense and use their 
defensemen to compliment it by 
keeping them tight at the blue 
line and involved in the offensive 
play, it’s a sight to behold.

The players aren’t in denial. 

They know this team doesn’t 
have an identity yet. Sophomore 
defenseman Zach Werenski 
acknowledged that Sunday.

 “An identity is built over a full 

year,” he said. “When we get to 
playoffs, I think we’re going to 
find it. I’m not too worried about 
it. It wasn’t a great weekend for 
us, but when it comes time for 
playoffs, I think we’ll be dialed in 
and ready to go.”

The concerning questions, 

though, are this: What happens 
if Michigan needs something 
to lean on in a tight game early 
in the postseason? What if 
the Wolverines can’t replicate 
the performances from their 
winning stretches, but instead 
have one of their off games in a 
win-or-go-home situation?

The weekend against Ohio 

State brought a serious concern 
to the forefront. The Wolverines 
don’t have a reliable identity yet, 
and finding it in the middle of 
a postseason run might not be 
good enough.

There are 17 days until the 

NCAA Tournament. The clock is 
ticking.

‘M’ doesn’t 
deserve the 
postseason 
this year

W

hen I was younger 
— younger than 
22, that is — and 

played recreational basketball, 
at the end of every season, I 
got a trophy. That’s right — 
undefeated or winless — if I 
showed up 
for Tuesday 
night 
practices 
and for 
games on 
Sunday 
mornings, 
I walked 
away with 
hardware at 
the end of 
the season. 
And get this — I made the 
playoffs, too, because, well, 
every team did, records be 
damned.

I liked the idea of being 

rewarded regardless of my 
effort or my team’s result.

Show up. Run around. 

Thank Nathan’s mom for 
bringing the postgame snack 
(Gushers and Capri Sun!). 
Clinch a guaranteed spot in the 
postseason. Get a trophy.

Now, nearly the same height 

but a few years wiser, I get 
that’s not how things work and 
not how they should have back 
in my young hoops days. 

Trophies are reserved for 

winners. The postseason is 
earned.

Showing up isn’t enough. 

Talking about winning isn’t 
enough. Perform at a high 
level, and you get rewarded 
with the opportunity — the 
privilege — to continue playing. 

The Michigan men’s 

basketball team doesn’t 
deserve a postseason. Not 
after it had a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament wrapped up and 
sitting on its doorstep, but 
squandered opportunities to 
finish out the season.

But what about the National 

Invitational Tournament — the 
NCAA Tournament’s little 
brother that brings 32 teams 
who weren’t good enough to sit 
at the big kids’ table together 
for a second-rate postseason?

That seems like a likely 

landing spot for the Wolverines 
(10-8 Big Ten, 20-11 overall) 
after they dropped games to 
Wisconsin on the road and 
then to Iowa to close out their 
regular season.

Michigan coach John 

Beilein said on Sunday that 
his team would embrace any 
opportunity for postseason 
play. But the NIT feels like a 
massive second prize when a 
spot in the NCAA Tournament 
was its for the taking. A win 
against either the Badgers 
or the Hawkeyes would have 
given Michigan 11 conference 
wins, a number with which no 
Big Ten team has ever missed 
the NCAA Tournament.

But instead, last Sunday 

in Madison, the Wolverines 
squandered an opportunity to 
steal a rare game on the road. 
A one-point lead in the second 
half was erased by a 13-3 
Wisconsin run.

Six days later, with a 

whole week to regroup, the 
Wolverines fell flat against 
Iowa, which was riding a four-
game losing streak into Crisler. 
Instead, Michigan made the 
Hawkeyes look like their old 
selves, the ones who kicked 
off Big Ten play with seven 
straight wins, including upsets 
over then-No. 1 Michigan State 
and then-No. 14 Purdue.

After its own win against 

Purdue three weeks ago, 
Michigan looked poised for 
a spot in the tournament. 
In a gritty battle against a 
bigger Boilermakers team, 
the Wolverines fought for 
rebounds and outscored 
Purdue in the paint to clinch 
their ninth conference win.

The rest looked easy. 

Michigan had games against 
Ohio State, Maryland, 
Northwestern, Wisconsin and 
Iowa to close out the season. 
Win any two, and it would 
almost be guaranteed to hear 
its name on Selection Sunday. 
It would have earned it, by any 
measure.

But against Ohio State, 

Michigan looked as bad in 
person as it did on television 
from ESPN’s sideline angle. 
At Maryland, the Wolverines 
were unable to close out after 
clawing back in the second 
half.

Michigan edged 

Northwestern by single digits 
after letting it hang around late 
into the second, locking up win 
No. 10, but it couldn’t get No. 11 
in its final two contests.

When Michigan pushed, 

opponents pushed back 
harder. When Michigan had 
margin-closing scoring streaks, 
opponents had game-ending 
runs. And when Michigan 
needed to buckle down late 
in games, it couldn’t. Its 
two seniors sat injured on 
the bench for all but two 
conference games, and no one 
else appeared to provide the 
needed mental toughness on 
the court.

Saturday’s matchup with 

Iowa was a perfect showcase. 
It was a must-win game, but 
Michigan played it like a sort-
of-maybe, sure-would-be-nice-
to-win game. Eleven turnovers 
— including one late in the 
second half by junior guard 
Zak Irvin when the Wolverines 
were threatening a comeback 
— were too much to overcome. 
Shooting just 24 percent from 
3-point range didn’t help 
either.

When the final buzzer 

sounded Saturday night, 
Michigan looked far from a 
team deserving of a postseason.

Beilein has long said he 

doesn’t lobby the NCAA 
Tournament selection 
committee on behalf of his 
team. After losing to Iowa, 
though, he made the case that 
Michigan might still deserve 
a shot.

“We do have 10 wins in a 

very good league,” Beilein said. 
“We do have some wins over 
top-25 teams. We’ve played a 
lot of top-25 teams. And I’m 
sure (other teams) have similar 
arguments.

“I really trust the people 

in that (selection committee) 
room. They’re really talented 
at what they do. They don’t 
get too many of these things 
wrong.”

If Beilein’s right, and the 

selection committee doesn’t 
make mistakes, his team 
shouldn’t get a shot at the big 
kids’ tournament. It doesn’t 
deserve it.

Save for two wins in the 

Big Ten Tournament, the 
Wolverines don’t have business 
being there. To win three, 
they would need to beat a top-
seeded Indiana in their second 
game — a team that pummeled 
Michigan at home earlier in the 
season.

History isn’t on the 

Wolverines’ side either. 
Michigan has won more than 
one game in the conference 
tournament only once under 
Beilein. The way this team has 
been playing, it doesn’t look 
like that will change this year.

What will happen instead 

is that Michigan will accept 
an offer to play in the NIT 
with the have-nots — a prize 
more befitting a team of the 
Wolverines’ stature, but still 
a prize, nonetheless. One 
Michigan doesn’t deserve.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Beilein makes tournament 
case for reeling Wolverines

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

In each of the last five seasons, 

every team to finish with a 
winning record in Big Ten play 
has received an invitation to the 
NCAA Tournament. This year, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team is 10-8 in conference 
games.

The long-running precedent, 

however, 
seems 
unlikely 
to 

save the Wolverines, who have 
dropped four of their last five 
games and appear ready to break 
the trend. After a 71-61 loss to 
Iowa on Saturday, the expert 
consensus holds that Michigan 
would need an improbable run 
in the Big Ten Tournament — 
first, a win over Northwestern, 
then another against top-seeded 
Indiana — for its résumé to qualify 
for the Big Dance once again.

“We did get 10 wins,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
on Saturday. “I think (if) you do 
research on how many times you 
get 10 wins in this league...”

Beilein trailed off, knowing 

he had made his point. By the 
numbers, the Wolverines have 
done just enough to put themselves 
in the conversation. A winning 
mark in the Big Ten, three wins 
over opponents in the RPI top 50 
and no inexplicable losses make 
for a reasonably compelling track 
record, one that gets teams into 
the field of 68 more often than not.

The eyeball test tells the 

opposite story. The Wolverines are 
3-6 in their last nine games. They 
let Indiana score 25 unanswered 
points at Crisler Center on Feb. 2. 
They left Michigan State’s Bryn 
Forbes open for eight 3-pointers 
and 29 points in an equally 
humbling loss five days later. 
They had to fight tooth and nail in 
February to put away a Minnesota 

team that at the time had yet to 
record a Big Ten win.

If 
the 
numbers 
aren’t 
a 

factor, Michigan isn’t an NCAA 
Tournament team by any measure. 
A 
more 
analytical 
approach, 

Beilein seemed to say, leaves the 
matter open to interpretation.

“It has a lot to do with what the 

other teams are doing,” Beilein 
said. “Who was the competition? 
We do have 10 wins in a very good 
league. We do have some wins 
over top-25 teams, and we’ve 
played a lot of top-25 teams. I’m 
sure other people have similar 
arguments.”

Michigan’s ninth-year coach 

didn’t sugarcoat the situation, 
however. The Wolverines had 
five days off before taking on the 
Hawkeyes — five days to discuss 

that they needed a win if they 
wanted to keep their NCAA 
Tournament hopes alive.

The game’s opening minutes 

didn’t 
reflect 
Michigan’s 

predicament. It came out flat, 
quickly falling into a double-digit 
hole. It finished with 11 turnovers 
and a stunning 8-for-34 mark 
from 3-point range — all bad signs 
for a team that needed a break 
before the Big Ten Tournament.

“I’m not going to hide it from 

them and say, ‘Hey, maybe,’ ” 
Beilein said. “I’ve always felt we 
had to get more work done during 
this time. That way, any questions 
about us will be answered. Who 
knows what’s gonna happen from 
here?”

The fall since Michigan’s win 

over then-No. 18 Purdue on Feb. 

13 has been remarkable.

Then, it seemed the Wolverines’ 

problems were behind them. They 
had just recorded an all-important 
third win against an RPI top-
50 opponent, seen by many as a 
litmus test for deserving an NCAA 
Tournament bid. They sat at 9-4 
in the Big Ten, 19-7 overall and 
seemed like NCAA Tournament 
shoo-ins. All Michigan had to do 
was avoid a disastrous 1-4 or 0-5 
finish in its final five conference 
games.

The disastrous finish — once a 

hypothetical — is now reality, and 
it has left Michigan with one path 
to the NCAA Tournament, one 
that redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan Robinson needed only 
one word to outline on Saturday.

“Win.”

Michigan tested against adversity

Victory over 

California stops 

two-game 
losing skid

By NATE CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

After the Michigan baseball 

team started the season 4-0, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
wondered how the 19th-ranked 
Wolverines (7-3) would respond 
to inevitable adversity.

Bakich got his answer during 

Michigan’s Spring Break trip. 
After the Wolverines defeated 
St. Joseph’s, 5-1, on Feb. 26, 
they faltered in their next two 
contests, losing to Cal Poly, 5-1, 
and Santa Clara, 5-3. 

Michigan left nine men on 

base in each of its defeats.

“In each of our setbacks this 

Spring Break trip, you could point 
at something that contributed to 

the loss,” Bakich said. “We gave 
away too many bases against 
Cal Poly, and we didn’t execute 
with runners in scoring position 
against Santa Clara. Sometimes 
the growth comes from learning 
from your mistakes.”

But in the marquee matchup 

of the week — against then-No. 
10 California — the Wolverines 
responded strongly. Buoyed by 
sophomore 
left-hander 
Oliver 

Jaskie’s 5.1 scoreless innings, 
Michigan scored three runs in 
the third inning, en route to its 
5-0 victory.

“Seeing them get knocked 

down and pick themselves up 
after that, there was definitely 
some lessons learned there,” 
Bakich said. “You’re not always 
gonna have your A game. You’re 
not always going to be 100 
percent, so I think our guys have 
done a good job of responding to 
small amounts of adversity we’ve 
experienced.”

Relief pitching was another 

bright spot for the Wolverines 

against 
the 
Golden 
Bears. 

Freshman left-hander William 
Tribucher, junior right-hander 
Mac Lozer and junior left-hander 
Carmen 
Benedetti 
combined 

to pitch 3.2 scoreless frames, 
surrender two hits and strike out 
five batters.

“We’ve had a lot of time to 

bond 
and 
really 
collaborate 

together and create a mindset as 
a staff,” said sophomore right-
hander Ryan Nutof. “We played 
very athletic teams with a lot of 
speed (in California).”

Michigan carried its newfound 

confidence into its contest with 
San Jose State. With the score 
tied at five in the top of the sixth, 
sophomore shortstop Jake Bivens 
came up with a double to drive 
in a run and give the Wolverines 
their final 6-5 edge.

But then more problems arose 

as Michigan dropped its series 
opener against UC Davis, 4-3. 
A failed pick-off attempt by the 
Wolverines in the bottom of the 
fourth and a fielding error in the 

sixth both proved costly, as they 
each resulted in one unearned 
run for the Aggies.

“All the teams were extremely 

competitive 
in 
California,” 

Bakich said. “We competed well 
against Cal, San Jose State and 
UC Davis. I thought the effort 
was good (in those games).”

Before the Wolverines once 

again had the chance to bounce 
back from a loss, Mother Nature 
threw a wrench into things. 
Heavy rain cancelled their next 
two games against UC Davis, 
forcing Michigan to wait until 
March 10 for the chance at a fresh 
start at Hawaii.

“It’s disappointing to not play,” 

Nutof said. “This team is always 
hungry to play and always wants 
to compete.” 

The Wolverines passed their 

adversity test against the Golden 
Bears, but that’s just one game in 
a long season. When Michigan 
travels to Honolulu, Bakich will 
have a clearer picture of what 
kind of team he has.
