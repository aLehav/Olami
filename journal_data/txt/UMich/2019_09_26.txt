More than 300 students, 
faculty, 
and 
community 
members 
attended 
a 
lecture 
by 
former 
U.S. 
Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Samantha Power 
at the Ford School of Public 
Policy this Wednesday. As a 
distinguished guest of the 
Public Policy School’s third 
annual Vandenberg Lecture, 
Power discussed her career 
in 
diplomacy 
and 
began 
her talk with a reflection 
on her intentions behind 
writing 
her 
most 
recent 
memoir, “The Education of 
an Idealist”. 
“I have written a book 

in a very personal way,” 
Power 
said, 
“appealing 
to young people, and the 
young at heart – those who 
are feeling, right now, more 
of a pull to try to make a 
difference than they have 
ever felt in their lives.” 
Power served as the 28th 
U.S. representative to the 
United Nations from 2013 to 
2017, and was a member of 
President Barack Obama’s 
cabinet. Some of her most 
notable 
work 
included 
imposing sanctions on North 
Korea, 
opposing 
Russian 
aggression in Ukraine and 
Syria, 
and 
lobbying 
the 
release of political prisoners. 
President 
Obama 
praised 
her as one of the “foremost 

thinkers in public policy.” 
Powers immigrated from 
Ireland with her mother 
as a child. She specifically 
discussed 
how 
her 
background informed her 
worldview from a young age 
and impacted her career in 
public service later in life. 
“Having come to America 
as an immigrant back in 
the day... I really felt like 
going into government was 
something 
similar,” 
she 
said. “You had to suspend 
certain parts of who you 
were, or at least leave them 
at the door when you went 
in in the morning, and then 
master this new way of being 
and doing in order to be 
effective.”

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Bennett Neuhoff attended 
both this discussion and the 
talk with Stephen Biegun, 
U.S. Representative to North 
Korea, earlier this month. 
After the event, he discussed 
in an interview with The 
Daily 
how 
both 
events 
left 
him 
hopeful 
about 
the outlook of America’s 
influence abroad. 
“There is a very big sector 
of the United States that 
is not ready to necessarily 
surrender the United States’ 
influence 
abroad 
despite 
what some of the actions of 
the current administration 
have been,” Neuhoff said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Ann 
Arbor 
rent 
has 
skyrocketed in the last 
year, according to recent 
reports. And while the 
cost of living in the city 
continues to rise, local 
businesses 
are 
having 
trouble filling positions 
and keeping employees, as 
some residents feel unable 
to keep up with the rapidly 
increasing rent rate.
Since the demand for 
housing continues to be 
a concern in Ann Arbor, 
property 
management 
owners have built more 
housing structures, most 

of which are luxury high-
rise 
apartments 
with 
expensive rent rates — the 
newly built Vic Village, for 
example, has an average 
rent of $1300 per person 
per month for a 4 bedroom, 
4 bathroom unit. 
But 
as 
demand 
rises 
higher than supply, access 
to affordable housing has 
become 
less 
available. 
To navigate this issue, 
many people working in 
the city resort to living 
in areas outside of Ann 
Arbor, such as Ypsilanti. 
This poses another barrier 
to employment, as some 
residents 
may 
not 
be 
able to afford the added 

costs of a commute or 
have no reliable means 
of transportation of their 
own. 
There are many factors 
an Ann Arbor employee 
must 
consider 
when 
looking for jobs, including 
the ease of their commute 
and 
certain 
employee 
benefits 
to 
determine 
if working in such an 
expensive city is worth 
it, 
said 
Jennifer 
Hall, 
executive 
director 
of 
the Ann Arbor Housing 
Commission. 
“People 
are 
finding 
housing and then looking 
for jobs based on the 
distance, 
commute 
and 

ease of getting to work 
… and if they do not offer 
benefits like health care 
and paid sick time,” Hall 
said. “When workers are 
transient, it is harder to 
attract or keep them if they 
have a hard time getting to 
and from work.”
Phillis Engelbert, owner 
of local restaurants The 
Lunch 
Room 
on 
Fifth 
Avenue 
and 
Detroit 
Street Filling Station in 
Kerrytown, 
said 
many 
of her employees cannot 
afford to live in central 
Ann Arbor due to high rent 
prices.

Each month, The Michigan 
Daily’s Administration Beat 
sits down with University 
President Mark Schlissel to 
discuss important questions 
about 
University 
policy, 
commitments and challenges. 
Topics 
discussed 
at 
the 
interview included the search 
for a new Vice President of 
Student Life, the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality, Title IX policy 
and more. This transcript 
has been abbreviated and 
reordered for reader clarity. 
Search for new VP of 
Student Life
The Michigan Daily: Given 
the 
recent 
announcement 
that Vice President E. Royster 
Harper will be retiring, what 
will the process to select a 
new VP of student life look 
like? 
President Mark Schlissel: 
In the next week, we’ll have 
an announcement, but we’re 
putting together a search 
committee that will have on 
the committee faculty, staff 
and several students — not 
just one student.

Federal Court 
vacates past
ruling on Bias 
Response Team

Judge decides group infringes on First 
Amendment rights of free speech

Of the University of Michigan’s 
over 30,000 undergrad students, 
about 230 students are from the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The 
University’s new U.P. Scholars 
Program aims to increase this 
number by building a community for 
some of these students that provides 
them with transitional support.
The first cohort in fall 2020 will 
consist of seven to 10 students from 
the U.P., according to Cheyenne 
Marlin, U.P. Scholars Program 
assistant director. Each student will 
be given financial assistance of up to 
$15,000 each year for four years. 
In addition to financial support, 
Marlin said the program will 
offer students in the program any 
academic, social and professional 
assistance they may need during 
their time at the University.
“We know that the numbers for 
students from the Upper Peninsula 
are lower, and so we’re striving to 
support students from every corner 
of Michigan,” Marlin said. “With 
the distance being a huge barrier 
for students coming from the U.P., 
we think that something like this 
could really help students be 
successful here at Michigan.”

A federal appeals court 
voided a ruling in favor of the 
University of Michigan’s Bias 
Response Team on Monday, 
arguing the group infringes 
upon First Amendment rights 
and suppresses freedom of 
speech across campus. The 
decision sent the case back to 
the U.S. District Court and 
reversed the August 2018 
ruling by district court Judge 
Linda V. Parker, who ruled in 
favor of the University and the 
BRT. 
The role of the University’s 
BRT is to investigate claims 
of racism, sexism and other 
forms 
of 
discrimination 
put forth by those at the 
University. 
The 
lawsuit 
alleges the BRT, which allows 
students, faculty and others 
at the University to report 
incidents of bias, violates the 
First Amendment because 
the claims quell freedom 
of speech and may not be 
completely legitimate.
In May 2018, the University 
became the first university 
in the country to receive a 
federal lawsuit related to 
freedom of speech when 

Speech First, an organization 
dedicated to promoting and 
upholding free speech on 
American college campuses, 
filed 
a 
lawsuit 
alleging 
the BRT violates the First 
Amendment. A month later, 
on June 11, the Department of 
Justice submitted a statement 
of interest in support of 
Speech First and the lawsuit. 
When contacted by The 
Daily, Speech First president 
Nicole 
Neily 
declined 
to 
comment 
specifically 
on 
the federal appeals court’s 
decision to vacate the U.S. 
district 
court’s 
ruling. 
Instead, Neily referred to a 
statement put out by Speech 
First in response to Monday’s 
decision.
“We are gratified that the 
court of appeals restored our 
case against the University 
of Michigan and ordered 
it to proceed in the district 
court,” the statement reads. 
“We continue to believe that 
the 
University’s 
policies, 
including the ones it tried 
to abandon after we filed 
suit, are blatant violations of 
the First Amendment. We 
look forward to vindicating 
our members’ rights as this 
litigation progresses.”

The University of Michigan 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon Neutrality hosted a 
community forum to speak on 
the progress of the commission 
in strategizing how to tackle 
carbon 
neutrality 
and 
to 
address community members’ 
concerns 
regarding 
the 
University’s lack of action. The 
event consisted of two parts: a 
public forum and question and 
answer session, and then small 
group discussions with leaders 
of different internal analysis 
teams 
of 
the 
commission. 
The town hall was open 
to all students, faculty and 
community members, and over 
100 people attended.
The President’s Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality was 

announced 
in 
February 
with the goal of providing 
recommendations 
to 
the 
University on how to achieve 
carbon neutrality through the 
collaboration of students and 
faculty. Last semester they held 
two town halls.
LSA sophomore Ari Cohen 
told The Daily he attended the 
event because as a Program in 
the Environment student, he 
wants to see how the University 
is planning to combat climate 
change. 
“I’m 
keenly 
interested 
in 
topics 
related 
to 
the 
environment,” 
Cohen 
said. 
“And clearly a pressing matter 
of today is climate change and 
I’d like to see the University 
take a stronger initiative on 
combating that. This is clearly 
one way in which they’re doing 
that and I’d like to be informed 

and involved if possible.”
The panel speakers were the 
co-chairs of the commission: 
Jennifer Haverkamp, director 
of the Graham Sustainability 
Institute, 
and 
Stephen 
Forrest, professor of electrical 
engineering 
and 
computer 
science. 
Haverkamp 
began 
by 
explaining how the commission 
has been tasked with a difficult 
goal and they need the help 
and input of all community 
members to achieve it. 

“The challenge is massive, 
but so is the climate crisis that 
we’re facing, so we have all 
thrown ourselves into this,” 
Haverkamp said. “But there 
are many dimensions, many 
stakeholders. It’s complex. This 
is a long-term effort that we’ve 
embarked upon and we need 
an 
engagement 
from 
everybody, all segments 
of the University, to be 
successful.”
Forrest 
discussed 
the processes by which 
the 
commission 
is 
formulating 
their 
recommendations 
and 
strategies. He said the 
commission is focusing 
on scope 1 emissions, 
which 
are 
direct 
emissions from owned 
or 
controlled 
sources, 
and scope 2 emissions, 
which 
are 
indirect 
emissions 
from 
the 
generation of purchased 
energy, 
according 
to 
the 
Greenhouse 
Gas 
Protocol. 
Forrest 
then 
noted 
how 
the 
commission 
is 
working 
on 
scope 
3 
emissions, 
are 
all 
indirect emissions not 
included 
in 
scope 
2, 
which includes students 
living off campus. He said 
numerical data has been 
a key factor in creating 
recommendations 
and 

strategies to combat scope 3 
emissions. 
“We have a tremendous 
number of students scattered 
among 
the 
communities,” 
Forrest said. “That’s one of 
the things that’s even harder. 
So, how do we get to those 
problems? And in what order 
do we get to them? Well, scope 
1 and scope 2 are pretty much 
top of the line. Scope 3 is much 
more difficult. The way we get 
to them is by measuring and 
having quantifiable methods 
for 
determining 
what 
we 
are emitting in each of those 
categories … if we can measure 
something, we can get it done.”
Forrest and Haverkamp then 
addressed questions from the 
audience. One attendee asked 
how the commission planned 
on 
incorporating 
energy 
justice and equity into their 
recommendations. 
Haverkamp 
said 
the 
members of the commission 
are making sure to keep in 
mind issues of environmental 
justice as they do their work 
every day.
“The charge that we have 
given to each of these analysis 
teams 
is 
to 
include 
the 
consideration of justice issues 
as they do their research and 
develop their recommendations 
to us,” Haverkamp said. “That 
includes also reaching out to 
communities that are usually 
underrepresented 
in 
these 
conversations. We will work on 
these issues together.”
The next question referred 
to how the University of 
California 
school 
system 
recently divested their entire 
endowment 
from 
fossil 
fuels. The audience member 
asked what is preventing the 
University of Michigan from 
divesting.

Thursday, September 26, 2019 — 3

There will be undergrad 
and 
either 
graduate 
or 
professional students on it, 
there will be some student 
affairs people, there will be 
some regular professors, I 
think a dean might be the 
chairperson of the search 
committee. So it will be a 
broad group that represents 
many 
of 
the 
different 
constituencies that depend 
upon the success of this 
person, the new VP… We can’t 
expect someone that we hire 
brand new to be as talented 
at this job as Vice President 
Harper, who had been in this 
position for 19 years as Vice 
President of Student Life, and 
before that she was dean of 
the college. So she’s not really 
replaceable. We’ll try our best 
and we’ll get somebody good, 
but on day zero they’re not 
going to be Royster Harper.
TMD: How long does the 
process take? 
MS: 
It 
takes 
several 
months. The first thing we 
do is come up with a good 

job 
description, 
then 
we 
advertise, then we try to 
build up lots of applicants. At 
the same time, we’re doing 
this outreach where we’re 
talking to groups and trying 
to get a sense of everyone’s 
expectations and what we 
really should be looking for. 
It takes a while and it’s worth 
the time and investment. VP 
Harper is going to step away 
in mid-January. It’d be great 
if we had a new person then, 
but we also might appoint an 
interim person to tide us over 
while we finish doing a good 
search. 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality
TMD: 
Following 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate Strike last March, 
demonstrators 
staged 
a 
sit-in 
in 
the 
Fleming 
Administration Building to 
demand a one-hour meeting 
with the administration about 
climate 
change 
concerns 
and the University’s plan to 
reach carbon neutrality. 10 
demonstrators were arrested 
or remaining in the building 
past 8 p.m., including two 
minors, 
and 
were 
given 

trespassing citations. In June, 
six of the demonstrators 
appeared in court for the first 
time and plead not guilty to 
all charges, and a pre-trial 
date was set for September 
13. What do you expect the 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
to 
accomplish 
in the upcoming semester? 
The commission’s goal is to 
provide 
recommendations 
to the University on how to 
achieve 
carbon 
neutrality 
through the collaboration of 
students and faculty.
MS: They’ve been working 
all 
through 
the 
summer. 
They’ve divided up the big 
task of figuring out how and 
how quickly we can go carbon 
neutral into a bunch of 
smaller tasks … They’ve also 
put out a request for students 
who want to come and work 
for the commission for pay, 
doing research in support of 
the mission … The biggest 
thing 
I’m 
nervous 
about 
in our ability to go carbon 
neutral is how we heat the 
campus.

“Some of our employees 
live in Whitmore Lake, a 
number of them live out 
toward the edge of Ann 
Arbor and Ypsilanti in 
the apartment complexes 
on 
Washtenaw 
and 
Packard and areas like 
that,” 
Engelbert 
said. 
“It’s almost impossible 
for them to find housing 
in central Ann Arbor. 
They’re just priced out.”
Engelbert 
echoed 
Hall’s statement about 
the 
added 
difficulties 
a 
commute 
poses 
for 
employees 
working 
in 
Ann Arbor. 
“I 
have 
personally 
tried to help some of our 
staff find housing closer 
to work and it’s a real 
challenge,” 
Engelbert 
said. “We’ve had to alter 
people’s 
schedules 
so 
that they can make it 
back to Ypsilanti with 
what the bus allows.”
Mitch 
Czechowicz, 
kitchen manager at the 
Detroit 
Street 
Filling 
Station, recently moved 
to Ypsilanti due to high 
Ann Arbor rent rates.
“I moved to Ypsilanti 
because 
I 
couldn’t 
really afford to live in 
Ann 
Arbor 
anymore,” 
Czechowicz said. “I was 
living with two other 
guys and our rent was 
just most of the money 
we were making for not 
that much space at all… I 
pay about $200 a month 
less in Ypsilanti for more 
space.”
Czechowicz 
faces 
a 
25-minute 
daily 
commute to work from 
Ypsilanti, 
sometimes 
taking up to an hour due 
to traffic and vehicle 
issues.
“I gotta deal with rush 
hour and dealing with 
either 94 or Washtenaw 
and spending like an 
hour in traffic on a lot 
of days, and then just 
money put into gas and 
wear and tear on my 
vehicle,” 
Czechowicz 
said.
Engelbert 
said 
Ann 
Arbor has become an 
exclusive place for the 
elite because of the high 
rent prices.
“We pay our people 
pretty 
well 
especially 
for 
a 
restaurant, 
but 
Ann Arbor has become 
so exclusive and elite in 
terms of who can afford 
to live here that people 
who 
make 
a 
normal 
amount of money just 
can’t 
find 
housing,” 
she said. “They cannot 
afford to live in the city. 
Ann Arbor as a whole 
is part of that trend 
toward 
gentrification 
and the rich get richer 
and the poor move out of 
town — and it’s not just 
the poor. $38,000 a year 
isn’t poor; it’s normal, 
and people can’t afford 
to live here.”
Engelbert 
stressed 
Ann Arbor should push 
toward more affordable 
housing and be more 
inclusive of those from 
diverse 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds.
“It will have to take 
a concerted effort by 
public 
and 
private 
sectors to make it do 
anything 
different,” 
Engelbert said “There 
has to be a will and a 
desire to see Ann Arbor 
be 
an 
economically 
diverse city. If there’s 
not a will and a desire to 
see that, then we’ll just 
keep trending more and 
more 
toward 
wealthy 
residents.”
Other local businesses 
are facing similar issues. 
Nick Yribar, co-owner 
of 
local 
comic 
book 
store Vault of Midnight 
on 
S. 
Main 
Street, 
expressed the difficulty 
his 
business 
has 
had 
in accommodating the 
rising costs of rent in Ann 
Arbor for employees.
“We’ve been in Ann 
Arbor for 23 years, so 
we have seen how the 
market 
has 
changed 

… 
it’s 
heartbreaking,” 
Yribar said. “We employ 
maybe 10 people just 
at our Ann Arbor shop 
and it’s just increasingly 
difficult for anyone that 
works for us to live in 
this city.”
Vault 
of 
Midnight 
has attempted to keep 
existing employees and 
recruit new employees 
despite 
housing 
unaffordability 
by 
negotiating pay raises 
and offering employee 
benefits that may not 
be 
available 
at 
other 
businesses. 
“We’re in the process 
right now of raising the 
base pay for our staff 
for the entire company,” 
Yribar said. “We try to 
be as competitive as we 
can; we offer SIMPLE 
IRA 
programs 
and 
health care and profit-
based bonuses, and all 
of this is just in an effort 
to keep people around 
given 
that 
they 
can’t 
afford to live in Ann 
Arbor. I don’t think any 
of our staff lives within 
the 
city 
anymore, 
I 
think almost everybody 
is 
commuting 
from 
Ypsilanti or farther.”
Issues 
like 
high 
rent prices aren’t only 
affecting the city at the 
residential level, but also 
entire 
businesses 
and 
their ability to remain 
open 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
at an affordable rate. 
Yribar’s store has moved 
locations 
on 
multiple 
occasions due to rent 
concerns over time.
“Over the 23 years that 
we’ve been in business 
we’ve had four different 
locations, 
and 
we’re 
always moving due to 
rent concerns and due 
to 
issues 
navigating 
property owners until 
we 
landed 
on 
Main 
Street,” 
Yribar 
said. 
“The number one thing 
we’re worried about is 
‘are we going to be able 
to afford to be in this 
city?’”
Local 
business 
owners worry that as 
rent rates continue to 
rise for both residents 
and 
businesses, 
only 
particularly 
wealthy 
businesses 
and 
chain 
locations will be able 
to afford to stay open, 
eventually 
eliminating 
the ability of current 
local 
businesses 
to 
remain open and local 
residents to open new 
businesses in Ann Arbor. 
“Especially 
long-
standing small and local 
businesses (are at risk),” 
Yribar said. “If you just 
take a look at the number 
of vacant spots on Main 
Street at the moment … 
it’s startling to see these 
businesses leave.” 
Business owners like 
Yribar 
say 
the 
issue 
of 
affordable 
housing 
in Ann Arbor is the 
important 
problem 
facing 
the 
city 
right 
now, as it continues to 
affect 
the 
shape 
and 
direction in which the 
city progresses. 
“Affordable 
housing 
and being able to live 
and work in this city 
are changing Ann Arbor 
more 
than 
any 
other 
single 
factor,” 
Yribar 
said. “There’s nothing 
more pressing happening 
in Ann Arbor than the 
ability 
of 
the 
people 
that work here, make it 
cool and make it special 
being able to live here. 
We think about it every 
single day and there’s 
only so much we can do 
with a small business. 
We can try to take care 
of people, we can try to 
entice them to stay with 
us, but it is a huge issue.”
Yribar 
called 
on 
students 
to 
be 
more 
aware of city issues in 
order to get involved 
and make a proactive 
change.
“Students 
should 
be 
aware 
of 
what 
is 
happening in the city 
that they’re a part of for 
however 
long,” 
Yribar 
said. “Do we think as a 

city that there is value 
in having the voice of 
younger people, and of 
renters, and of people 
that 
don’t 
just 
own 
property on the west 
side of Ann Arbor? I 
think that there is, and 
I think that it makes the 
city stronger.” 
Social 
Work 
student 
Laura 
Rall 
is 
the 
president 
of 
Affordable Michigan, an 
affordability 
advocacy 
group on campus. She 
said the organization’s 
main priority for this 
year is to advocate for 
more on-campus dorms.
“U-M 
has 
increased 
the number of students 
enrolled 
each 
year 
over the past few years 
significantly. 
There 
are 
thousands 
more 
students, 
but 
they 
haven’t built any new 
dorms,” Rall said. “We 
are really trying to push 
this year for a new dorm 
being built. Obviously 
the 
less 
on-campus 
housing that’s available 
for 
students, 
they’re 
going to have to go out 
into the city and get 
these places from people 
who live in Ann Arbor. 
Same with students who 
commute from Ypsilanti, 
and it is taking homes 
away from people who 
live in Ypsilanti full-
time.” 
As 
more 
expensive 
forms of student housing 
are being built, students 
are forced to move off-
campus 
for 
cheaper 
options, taking homes 
away from people who 
live and work in the area 
full-time, Rall said.
“I 
think 
it’s 
100 
percent the University’s 
problem 
because 
they 
are 
admitting 
more 
students,” 
Rall 
said. 
“It’s really just not fair 
to the people who do live 
in Ann Arbor full-time, 
and families with jobs 
because 
it’s 
becoming 
more of a University-
focused town instead of 
a town that also has a 
University in it, which is 
what it should be.”
Ambrose 
Wilbanks, 
workforce development 
liaison for Destination 
Ann Arbor, a local visitors 
bureau, highlighted the 
growth Ann Arbor has 
undergone 
over 
time, 
incidentally driving rent 
prices up.
“I was born and raised 
in 
Ypsilanti 
and 
to 
look at the University, 
it’s 
unrecognizable 
compared 
to 
what 
I 
saw 
in 
high 
school,” 
Wilbanks 
said. 
“Plus, 
the 
tax 
sector 
has 
expanded exponentially 
which if you look at 
people in that sector of 
the workforce, they tend 
to be more professional, 
more high income in the 
end. People will charge 
as much as you’re willing 
to pay.”
Wilbanks 
said 
since 
Ann Arbor has expanded, 
it’s well understood the 
demand to live here is 
met with many high-
income residents.
“The reality is that 
to live here you have to 
have a certain amount 
of disposable income,” 
Wilbanks 
said. 
 
“I 
think that people are 
very welcoming across 
the 
board 
with 
the 
understanding 
that 
you can only be their 
neighbor 
if 
there’s 
housing you can afford.”
Czechowicz, who has 
lived in Ann Arbor for 
about 15 years, agreed 
the area has changed 
significantly over time.
 “I mean there are a 
lot 
more 
corporations 
for 
one,” 
Czechowicz 
said. “Even just having 
things like Subways and 
7-11’s 
right 
downtown 
seems 
kind 
of 
weird 
sometimes. I’m used to 
having a more localized 
feel to it, like when I was 
a kid… I wish it was the 
way it used to be. Ann 
Arbor 
definitely 
feels 
more pretentious than it 
used to be.”

RETENTION
From Page 1

When the case reached the 
U.S. district court in August 
2018, Parker rejected Speech 
First’s request for a preliminary 
injunction against the BRT and 
sided with the University. In 
her statement signed Aug. 6, 
2018, Parker wrote in a court 
opinion the BRT does not violate 
the First Amendment rights to 
freedom of speech but instead 
may only “chill” these rights. 
“Speech First alleges, and 
Defendants do not deny, that 
students engaged in ‘bullying’ 
and ‘harassing’ behavior can be 
and have been punished through 
(Office 
of 
Student 
Conflict 
Resolution) 
proceedings,” 
Parker wrote. “Speech First, 
however, fails to demonstrate 
that the BRT poses anything but 
a ‘subjective chill’ on students’ 
free speech rights.”
While Speech First’s lawsuit 
was filed over a year ago, 
issues of free speech are still 
being debated on campus and 
throughout the state. On Sept. 5 
two bills related to campus free 
speech passed in the Michigan 
House 
of 
Representatives’ 
House Oversight Committee. 
The two bills — “The Campus 
Free Speech Act” and “The 
College Campus Intellectual 
and Expressive Freedom Act”— 
aim to set standards for how 

universities in Michigan create 
policies relating to freedom of 
speech. 
LSA junior Lincoln Ballew, 
chairman of the University’s 
chapter of Young Americans for 
Freedom, said she was happy 
to learn the federal appeals 
court ruled in favor of Speech 
First Monday. Ballew said Bias 
Response Teams like those at 
the University have a known 
record of violating the rights to 
freedom of speech on college 
campuses. 
“I absolutely think the Bias 
Response Teams are a violation 
of the First Amendment and 
our Constitution, and so I 
personally believe that vacating 
the ruling is a huge win for the 
First Amendment and for free 
speech,” Ballew said. “People 
are afraid to share their points 
of view and their opinions 
because 
of 
these 
response 
teams — they’re afraid that 
their comments in class will be 
reported and they’re going to get 
in trouble with the University.”
Maria 
Muzaurieta, 
LSA 
senior and president of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, issued a statement 
on behalf of the organization. 
Muzaurieta 
said 
the 
group 
continues to support Speech 
First and the ideas they promote 
about freedom of speech. 
“We stand behind Speech 
First in their efforts to rid U-M 
of oppressive rules that mock 

the spirit of our great First 
Amendment,” 
Muzaurieta 

wrote in a statement to The 
Daily. “The University seems 
keen on providing ex post 
facto 
justification 
of 
their 
commitment to free expression 
when the reality for the students 
represented in the case was 
so 
much 
different. 
College 
Republicans 
stand 
foremost 
behind principles of free speech, 
and hope that the University 
better 
adheres 
to 
those 
principles in the future.”
When 
contacted 
by 
The 
Daily, the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats declined 
to comment about Monday’s 
ruling because they felt they had 
nothing to add. 
University spokesperson Kim 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
to The Daily the University 
maintains 
their 
existing 
policies 
regarding 
freedom 
of speech, which are outlined 
in the University’s policy of 
Freedom of Speech and Artistic 
Expression.
“The 
panel’s 
decision 
did not address the merits 
of 
the 
university’s 
existing 
policies, and we are confident 
the university will prevail,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“U-M 
is deeply committed to the 
protection of free speech by 
students, faculty, and outside 
speakers alike, regardless of 
their views.”

FREE SPEECH

“It’s really encouraging to 
see 
both 
administrations 
kind of unite in saying that a 
world with the United States 
at the helm is a better place.” 
Power’s memoir follows the 
unique path Power followed 
on her journey to going into 
diplomacy. Beginning as a 
war correspondent on the 
Yugoslav Wars for multiple 
publications 
including 
the Boston Globe and the 
Economist, she transitioned 
to human rights advocacy, 
and 
eventually 
became 
the 
youngest 
American 
to assume the role of U.S. 
Ambassador to the United 
Nations. Powers explained 
her book is a fusion of her 
personal 
memoir 
with 
concrete policy analysis.
“My book is definitely 
unique 
in 
the 
political 
memoir 
domain 
in 
combining ample discussion 
of romance with a darker 
discussion of Putin – but 
with no connection between 
the two,” Power said. 
Powers went on to discuss 
a range of policy issues she 
focused on during her time 
in office, from relations with 
the Middle East to the Ebola 
crisis 
that 
ravaged 
West 
Africa in 2014. She touched 
on what she viewed as her 
greatest failure in office – 
Obama’s inability to secure 
congressional approval for 
a military strike in Syria in 
2013. 
After the event, Public 

Policy 
graduate 
student 
Mohammad Akbar Zadran 
told 
The 
Daily 
that 
he 
attended the lecture in an 
attempt to see foreign policy 
in action. 
“I came to this event in 
order to learn about the 
practicality 
of 
diplomacy 
and foreign policy in the 
United States,” Zadran said. 
“In class we have discussions 
about policy as an academic 
arena, but here we hear about 
its practical implementation 
and implications and the 
effect on the United States 
and around the world. 
Ultimately, 
Power 
concluded by stressing to 
students the importance of 
having specific, streamlined 
policy goals in the field of 
diplomacy, and to celebrate 
every small win. 
“He or she who fights every 
battle fights none,” she said. 
“Figure out what your slice 
of change is…Sometimes we 
get a little grandiose about 
all we can achieve – and 
you’ll get there. But I think if 
each step is a growth, if you 
can identify the minimum

My body hair, my choice

What I’ve learned from young activists

SAMANTHA SZUHAJ | COLUMN

ISABELLE SCHINDLER | COLUMN

C

ollege is lauded as a frontier 
of 
adolescent 
freedom. 
Leaving home for higher 
education is the first chance for 
young adults to act without constant 
supervision and create a personal 
brand. I was no exception: I became 
a vegetarian, started worshipping 
The Smiths and stopped removing 
my body hair. Whether because it 
was the most obvious or the most 
controversial choice I made, the 
last decision garnered the most 
attention. A lot of it was positive, but 
between gendered expectations for 
dating and for young professionals, 
I encountered negative reactions in 
the form of implicit ambivalence. 
While my body hair became a part 
of my identity, the negativity was still 
difficult to endure. A little over a year 
later, my decision to transfer to the 
University of Michigan presented the 
perfect opportunity for a rebranding. 
The razor I had previously put down 
was picked up again. This decision 
also brought negative responses, this 
time more internal: Was I upholding 
outdated patriarchal standards of 
womanhood? Did shaving my legs, 
especially for romantic purposes, 
make me a bad feminist?
Whether my decision was to 
shave or not to shave, both came 
with the fear of not meeting 
expectations. 
American 
society 
has strong opinions on pretty much 
everything women choose to do, 
including whether or not they 
remove their body hair. Letting it 
grow can have professional and 
romantic consequences; on the 
other hand, staying smooth may 
garner criticisms of conforming to 
sexist, unrealistic beauty standards. 
These contrasting opinions create a 
dichotomy in which it’s impossible 
to make the “right” choice regarding 
body hair and women are not free to 
make their own decisions. In the era 
of My Body, My Choice, now is the 
perfect time to consider all of the 
ways in which our bodies are legally 
and socially policed. This slogan has 
powerful potential ranging from 
medical procedures to the hair on 
our legs. Using this principle of 
bodily autonomy, we can create a 
culture where the choice to remove 
or not remove body hair is exactly 
that – a choice.

Up until recently, body hair 
removal for women has been all but 
mandatory, an expectation upheld by 
men, other women and mass media 
such as advertising. The modern 
practice of body hair removal began 
in the early 1900s with Gillette’s 
marketing of their women’s safety 
razor, but according to Rebecca 
Herzig, author of “Plucked: A 
History of Hair Removal,” bare 
bodies were truly established as the 
standard of beauty during World 
War II. At this point, body hair 
removal became the norm: By 1964, 
98 percent of women regularly 
shaved their legs. Even now, almost 
every American woman will remove 
body hair at some point in her life, 
with 85 percent doing so routinely. 
Advertising helped begin the 
modern practice of hair removal 
and still plays a huge role in 
maintaining 
it. 
Typical 
hair 
removal ads of the 21st century 
feature images of thin, tanned 
women twirling around on beaches 
and running pink razors over 
already bare legs. The message is 
clear to me: Being beautiful and 
being clean-shaven are one and 
the same. The only way to fulfill 
one’s potential as a woman is to 
remove body hair, which is so 
unsightly even the advertisements 
for removal products won’t show it. 
This norm expands beyond the 
realm of beauty into standards 
of hygiene. As Rebecca Tuhus-
Dubrow describes in an article for 
The Guardian, a woman’s body hair 
is considered “inherently wrong, 
gross and dirty.” In fact, body hair 
removal is so intertwined with 
femininity that many men, despite 
being embarrassed about their 
body hair, won’t take part in this 
grooming ritual due to its “unmanly” 
reputation.
The past couple of years have 
witnessed slightly more lenient 
rules regarding hair removal. The 
proportion of women who regularly 
shave their underarms dropped 18 
percent from 2013 to 2016 while 
the percentage of women who 
regularly shave their legs dropped by 
a smaller but still significant seven 
percent. But for some members 
of the feminist community, these 
numbers are not enough. Even if 

it’s a choice, removing hair is still 
the oppressed choice. As Tuhus-
Dubrow puts it, in some circles the 
only “liberated” choice, and the 
only one worthy of approval, is the 
rejection of traditional femininity. 
Unfortunately, this attitude is 
not liberating at all. Rather than 
abolishing an outdated norm, it 
simply replaces it with a new one, 
and women are still denied the 
right to absolute power over their 
own bodies. If you’re free, you can’t 
be feminine, and if you’re feminine, 
you can’t be free. While this all-
or-nothing attitude may be well-
meaning, turning an authoritative 
mandate into an authoritative 
binary still denies women the 
freedom of choice.
In this war on body hair, how can 
we place the regulatory power held 
by institutions into the hands of 
individuals? Well, since advertising 
got us into this mess, maybe it can 
help get us out. A recent example is 
the razor company Billie’s Project 
Body Hair campaign, the first to 
show actual female body hair, which 
discusses hair removal as a variety 
of equally valid choices (“however, 
whenever, if ever”) instead of as a 
matter of right or wrong. Whether 
you remove the hair on every part 
of your body, or just the stuff on 
your toes; whether shaving is a 
daily routine, a special occasion, or 
skipped altogether – it’s entirely up 
to you. Rather than treating shaving 
versus not shaving as a binary, this 
kind of language creates a spectrum 
of body hair removal, allowing a 
reclamation of our bodies and what 
we choose to do with them. Most 
importantly, the examples set by 
mass media can be carried into our 
personal and professional lives, so 
our choices are not only our own 
– they are accepted. So wear your 
crop top on game day whether or 
not your pits are hairy. Pick out the 
perfect career fair look regardless 
of whether you’re shaving your legs. 
Your choice — as long as it’s your 
choice — is your participation in the 
new body hair revolution. Embrace 
it. Oh, and you’re allowed to shave 
your bodies, too.

I 

sometimes wish I had a 
more courage. Maybe it 
would help me speak up 
instead 
of 
turning 
away, 
or 
help 
me 
confront how I feel 
when I know it may 
be difficult. I wish 
I had more courage 
– particularly in the 
face of adversity.
Telling one person 
something 
they 
don’t want to hear is 
difficult enough. No 
one likes delivering 
bad news, no matter 
how 
predictable 
said 
news 
may be. Now, imagine standing 
alone, in front of differing 
news outlets and world leaders, 
sharing 
information 
that 
they may be familiar with but 
nevertheless is not easy to 
swallow. That takes someone 
with courage and a desire 
to bring change far beyond 
what most are capable of – no 
matter their age, background or 
particular beliefs regarding an 
issue.
To 
me, 
activist 
Greta 
Thunberg is that champion of 
courage.
The Swedish 16-year-old 
has been an active advocate for 
the climate, beginning with 
her standing alone outside 
the Swedish Parliament in 
2018. Since then Thunberg 
has been a vocal leader of the 
climate 
change 
movement, 
meeting with various world 
leaders, 
including 
former 
President Barack Obama in 
recent weeks, discussing the 
importance 
of 
dedicating 
national 
and 
international 
efforts 
towards 
stalling 
human 
impact 
on 
our 
environment.
If a single individual like 
Thunberg can make a change, 
so can we.
I used to feel, and still do 
at times, like I am but a single 
voice and actor and therefore 
my thoughts and actions can 
only make a minute impact. 
How can I, as one person, 
make a difference in my day-
to-day? How can I push for 
change, and back my opinions 
with action when I sometimes 
fail to speak up and out? 
Could I as a single person 
have the bravery to sit outside 
parliament, or the equivalent 

of 
such 
here 
on 
campus, 
alone, asking for something 
or pushing for change in 
such 
a 
daunting 
environment?
This past Friday, 
people around the 
globe 
walked 
out 
of classrooms and 
gathered 
in 
town 
centers, streets and 
squares 
pushing 
for 
change 
with 
painted signs and 
exasperated voices. 
Millions reportedly 
responded 
to 
the 
call, 
with 
outlets 
noting 
this to potentially be one of 
the largest climate protests 
in history. This action was 
something 
that 
Thunberg 
individually called for in her 
own right over a year ago 
– standing alone with her 
cardboard sign asking fellow 
students to join her in striking 
to bring attention to the 
nature of our environment.

If Thunberg can do it, so 
can we.
And the thing is, there are 
numerous 
young 
activists 
that have already answered 
respective 
calls 
to 
action. 
Sophie Cruz, at only five years 
old, handed a letter to the 
Pope, voicing her fears of ICE, 
due to the immigration status 
of her parents. Sophie since 
then has spoken out in favor of 
immigration reform, meeting 
with Obama and speaking in 
front of audiences including 
the Supreme Court and those 
gathered 
at 
the 
Women’s 
March on Washington. She is 

now eight. 
If they can, so can I. 
I challenge myself to be 
more courageous. Courage 
means 
various 
things 
to 
different people. It could 
be 
introducing 
ourselves 
to 
someone 
new, 
trying 
something that scares us 
or simply giving ourselves 
a break. Courage is a little 
different to all of us – but 
the common thread is that 
courage can catalyze change 
in whatever form it may take.
As we go into the year, I 
want to not only stand up, but 
stand out for things I believe 
in. I am going to push myself 
to not just say, but actually do 
something about how I feel. 
Whether it be joining a new 
organization, 
participating 
in events for my current 
commitments or seeking out 
groups championing things I 
believe in, I want to dedicate 
my energies without fear or 
apprehension of being the 
first to stand out, or stand 
alone.
Do you think the first 
person to decide to speak 
up 
against 
something 
was scared? Do you think 
Thunberg experienced some 
form of hesitation or doubt 
regarding her push for strikes 
and school walkouts? Without 
knowing personally, I would 
make 
an 
educated 
guess, 
that yes, they probably were. 
And that is what makes us 
human. But those who have 
championed 
movements 
— 
whether local or global — are 
also human. They have most 
likely been filled with the 
same reservations that we all 
face daily.
We can all take a page 
out of the books of those 
like Thunberg, the person 
who raises their hand in the 
large lecture or one who 
starts 
an 
organization 
on 
campus because it stands for 
something they believe in. 
I will try to be. And maybe, 
with time, my actions will 
drown out the voices we are 
all so accustomed to hearing 
– the doubt that just because 
we are one person we cannot 
make a difference.

The continued fight for fairer elections
T

he right to vote is one of 
the most sacred powers 
with which we have been 
entrusted. However, this right 
must continue to be protected 
from politicians and special 
interest groups who, through 
partisan gerrymandering, seek 
to meddle and exert undue 
influence.
Last November, Michigan 
voters voted 61.27 to 38.73 
percent in favor of Proposal 
2, 
which 
will 
create 
an 
independent 
redistricting 
commission to draw the state’s 
electoral districts. No longer 
will the majority party in 
the state legislature be able 
to redraw districts to benefit 
their party. Instead, this new 
commission will be staffed by 
ordinary citizens, not career 
politicians. 
As per the proposal, there is a 
very specific process to choose 
who will be on the commission. 
There must be four voters who 
identify as Republicans, four 
who identify as Democrats 
and five who either identify 
as a member of a third party 
or as a member of no party. In 
order for the new districts to 
be approved, consensus must 
be reached by a majority of 
the commission, including two 
Democrats, two Republicans 
and three of the people with 
no 
party 
or 
independent 
affiliation. 
Additionally, 
safeguards 
have 
been 
put 
in place to prevent people 
with political influence from 
getting on the commission. 
For instance, if you, your child, 
your parent or your spouse 
have served in the last six 
years as an elected official, 
partisan candidate, campaign 
consultant, 
lobbyist 
or 
a 
member of a governing body, 
then you are prohibited from 
serving on the commission. 

Each of these stipulations 
helps to ensure a fair and 
honest 
commission 
that 
will 
draw 
the 
district 
boundaries that Michiganders 
deserve. 
 However, 
the 
commission cannot effectively 
do its work if Republicans 
continue 
to 
weaken 
and 
undercut the committee at 
every turn. Since the approval 
of Proposal 2, Republicans 
in Michigan have waged a 
series of legal challenges to 
try to prevent the formation of 

this commission. This week, 
the 
Republican-controlled 
legislature took yet another 
step to restrict the effectiveness 
of 
the 
commission. 
Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer has said 
that 4.6 million dollars is 
needed to properly fund the 
redistricting 
commission. 
However, 
the 
 budget 
plan 
passed 
by 
the 
Republican 
controlled House and Senate 
Conference 
Committee 
allocates 3.4 million dollars. 
This 1.2 million dollar shortfall 
would be detrimental to the 
commission’s 
effectiveness. 
With something as important 
as our elections on the line, we 
cannot cut corners. 
Across the nation, partisan 
gerrymandering has wreaked 
havoc on our electoral system. 

It 
has 
allowed 
for 
the 
disenfranchisement of voters 
and for politicians to stifle 
change and unfairly choose 
their constituencies. In my 
own state Senate district in 
New York, the electoral lines 
have 
been 
systematically 
drawn to favor Republicans, 
splitting 
up 
towns 
and 
creating disjointed districts. 
When I worked on various 
local political campaigns in 
New York, people would come 
to the local office not sure 
who their representative was, 
given that their town had been 
divided during the redrawing 
of the districts.
Gerrymandering is practiced 
by both parties, and it is simply 
unacceptable. 
Independent 
commissions, such as the one 
in Proposal 2, are the only way 
in which we can create districts 
that are fair and allow voters’ 
voices to be heard. That is 
why it is so important that all 
of us in Michigan raise our 
voices to support the creation 
and 
full 
funding 
of 
this 
commission. There is a reason 
why Michiganders supported 
Proposal 2 by such a wide 
margin: They realized that, 
regardless of party, we should 
all strive for more fair elections 
free of outside influence. 
You can call your state 
senator or assembly member 
and 
voice 
your 
opposition 
to this funding cut. You can 
also sign up to volunteer and 
receive updates from Voters 
Not Politicians, the advocacy 
group 
that 
championed 
Proposal 2. If we truly want 
this, then we must push back 
against these budget cuts and 
work to ensure that Proposal 2 
is properly enacted.

I’ve been thinking a lot about uniforms lately. 
The first images that come to mind hail from eye 
roll-inducing, cliché depictions of elite schooling: 
Plaid skirts, navy blazers and khaki pants. A young 
Matt Damon getting branded as an anti-semitic 
prick as he gets dejected from his cushy pre-
Harvard purgatory, or Jenny Humphrey using her 
brother’s L.L. Bean pants as a punchline — the list 
goes on. Outside-looking-in type glimpses into the 
supposedly Shakespearean highs and lows of the 
very rich and disproportionately white. The most 
culturally significant edition of that canon — the 
one that feels like its been beaten into our heads 
with a Vuitton monogrammed baseball bat, is 
getting a reboot that will likely do well regardless 
of its content. Despite a social climate that seems a 
little bit less eager to simultaneously admonish and 
celebrate a system that bottlenecks the distribution 
of wealth and power, I can already envision articles 
about the new Serena and her $10,000 endangered 
crocodile skin boots. I’ve practically written, read 
and commented on that article in my head. That is 
why the show will succeed in its role as one part 
soap opera, one part live-action fashion editorial 
drowning in product placement. 
Before “Gossip Girl” transcended its own DNA, 
which was very much rooted in high school politics 
gone the way of Macbeth, the school uniform 
played a major role in the show. Often taken as a 
light suggestion as opposed to a unifying standard 
of dress, its employment in the visual makeup of 
each character was always more of a foundational 
class signifier. It merely symbolized the monetary 
weight of the storyline, the amount of status, 
power, fame and money that was at stake with 
each condescending quip or stock-plundering 
blast. The emphasis was on what was worn on top 
of it, around it, under it and what alterations were 
made to it. 
Blair, the conservative and conniving power 

that B, would fashion herself into the Queen of 
England during periods of vulnerability — clinging 
to veneers of her projected status as everything 
that lined it was tossed into a meat grinder. 
Serena, the best friend and foil to Blair, always 
seemed to find a low-cut tee shirt/vest combo, 
loosened tie, smattering of dangly gold necklaces 
and an ever-receding hemline to suffice. The 
impossibly beautiful and doesn’t know it (wow!), 
bad-girl-gone-good-but-sometimes-still-bad and 
sunshine barbie chaotic venus archetypes she 
simultaneously embodied were balanced by her 
beachy, sea-salt waves and the Chanel scarf that 
seemed to just fall from the sky and wrap itself 

around them.
You wanted to be Serena. She was genuinely kind 
and happy and unbothered by the wild amount 
of pressure she endured throughout her tenure 
as “Gossip Girl”’s mythological golden goddess 
muse. In doing so, you became Blair, who spent her 
days toiling over the things that materialized out 
of thin air for Serena, that Serena never bothered 
to ask for and turned into a “95 pound, doe-eyed, 
bonmot-tossing, label-whoring package of girly 
evil” in the process. Mega-sexist, only one queen 
can reign overtones aside, the ups and downs of 
their character arcs were underwritten by what 
they wore. They had a personal uniform, a range of 
tastes and proclivities that spoke to who they were 
as people; and a school uniform, the access card 
to a general mist of unattainability that followed 
them around as they erected entire utopias before 

burning them down within the span of a single 
episode. 
There are a lot of ways to go about dressing 
oneself. Many of their determining factors have 
to do with what’s appropriate or what will provide 
the most safety in a certain context. What’s going 
to get me through the day? Do I want to be seen? 
Do I want to project authority? Do I want to hide? 
What’s the amount of discomfort I’m willing to 
deal with in order to look good? Do I need to pass 
as something? All run like lightning bolts through 
the mind as we thumb through our cotton/poly in 
the morning. It doesn’t pay to give a lot of thought 
to it in the moment — the best outfit decisions are 
usually the quickest ones, too. 
Discussions about personal style, held long 
after those first calls are made and often drawn 
up in opposition to someone else’s (whether they 
be complementary or not), are when the self is 
defined. Somewhere in the interplay between 
private and public identity is where our current 
and ideal selves float around in the abstract. How 
we view ourselves and the securities we cling 
to, what we abide by. We all want to feel like our 
decisions are our own and not just a product of who 
we talk to and what we look at. 
Directors don’t make every decision and 
designers don’t oversee every thread that gets 
stitched. Production teams are like organisms, and 
the final product is one that had to pass through 
a lot of hands to get there. We might not be able 
to exert what feels like even a morsel of control 
over what trickles up to our processing centers 
and how we make the decisions that we do. We 
might not always be able to decide what channel 
of information flows through us, who we surround 
ourselves with or who we compare ourselves to. 
Thinking about what we look at, how we look at 
ourselves, and what might be influencing those two 
things is a surefire way of changing that course, 
though. Whether it be with a pair of Feiyues, a 
tried and true denim jacket or a pair of scandalous 
croc-skin boots — when you dress yourself, who is 
it that you’re trying to be?

Velveteen dreams: On
the uniform of identity

“We are all atomic particles, mixing together, in one big 
omelet,” says Engineering Junior Surar Al-Gayani about 
the process of collaborating artistically with his band 
members in Atomic Omelet. 
Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti-based band Atomic Omelet 
has one of the best names in the Washtenaw County music 
scene. While the image of an atomic breakfast first caught 
my attention, this band has proved to be much more 
than a product of creative marketing strategies. With an 
eclectic mix of ska, punk and funk in their repertoire and 
an incomparable stage presence, Atomic Omelet is a band 
you’ll want to see live at least once in your lifetime. 
Thankfully, this coming Saturday you will have the 
chance. Atomic Omelet will be performing alongside music 
acts “Isaich,” “Any Island” and “Industrial Sunglasses,” 
among others, at the Art of Armageddon Beach Party in 
Detroit, Michigan. 

I recently had the opportunity to sit down with the band 
and talk about their upcoming show. It was a particularly 
sunny Sunday morning, and each of the band’s members 
were joyfully laughing with one another over donuts 
that had been purchased from the bakery just an hour 
before. I had expected a more rambunctious crew of 
people, perhaps because their E.P. “Live at the Blind Pig” 
is filled with such electrically upbeat party rock. The band 
members’ calm personalities did not reflect the sound of 
their songs.
“I’ve learned that it’s cool to have meaning. But I’m not 
a good enough poet to have a good enough meaning to all 
of our songs,” says Atomic Omelet’s lyricist, guitar and vox 

player Sean Bass. At the Armageddon Beach Party this 
Saturday, audiences can expect a wide range of songs from 
Atomic Omelet. Some with meaning, others simply easy to 
dance to. 
“If you’re a dancing person, we have friendly but 
rowdy mosh pits at our concerts,” says Atomic Omelet’s 
drummer Stephen Valley, a 3rd-year graduate student in 
the College of Pharmacy. “There’s a good chance people 
will be jumping around on Saturday night, so if you come, 
be ready to have a good time.” 
The venue, Armageddon Beachparty, is an Art 
Duo & Creative Umbrella conceptualized by Motu & 
Komza, a married, Detroit-native artist pair who work 
collaboratively by merging their strong collection of artistic 
abilities. The duo have created over four hundred works of 
art together. The venue is surrounded in psychedelic art. 
The pieces at the venue remind me of ones you would find 
in the popular art collective “Meow Wolf.” “Meow Wolf” 
is an immersive art installation in New Mexico that was 
founded by a collective of artists. It is known for its unique 
and interesting interactive art.
In addition to being excited about the venue, the band 
members couldn’t stop raving about the other musicians 
that will be playing alongside them. 
“We’re playing the show with a bunch of our best 
friends. I’m excited because Connor booked a rapper, 
“Isaich.” We don’t get to play with a lot of rappers. It’s 
going to be a really fun show,” Valley said. 
Atomic Omelet is known for their vibrant stage 
presence during their sets. “You always have to hold the 
fifth member of the band in mind, which is the audience. 
They feel what we are feeling,” Al-Gayani added. Saturday 
evening’s set will be a collection of both original songs 
and covers. When discussing performing with the band 
members, their faces lit up. 
“If Armageddon was going down, why not have a beach 
party? Especially in the times we live in now,” Atomic 
Omelet’s guitarist, Surar Al-Gayani said.
Atomic Omelet will be hitting the stage at 9 p.m. 
Saturday night, so start your evening off right by arriving 
to the venue early. If you want to spend a few hours 
immersed in equally exhilarating art and music be sure to 
make your way over to Detroit on Saturday night.

Lauv gets down to the authentic emotions in 
his new single “feelings.” The fifth release off his 
upcoming album, ~how i’m feeling~ , “feelings” 
is an open letter from Lauv asking a girl if she 
would like to take their relationship to the next 
level. 
The song is intimate and deep, possessing a 
youthful infatuation experienced by many young 
people today. While the lyrics are vulnerable, 

Lauv sings with a confidence that suggests he’s 
sure of himself and the status of his relationship 
with his “friend.” The mellow, easy-goingness of 
the tune also contributes to the notion of young 
love and the risks taken to feel something real 
and intimate. 
Although the song deals with deeper 
emotions, Lauv presents the tune with genuine 
optimism. In his music video, he’s blowing 
bubbles and dancing amidst clouds, hearts and 
2000s themed polaroids. This kind of joyful 

enthusiasm is also hinted at in the song with its 
uplifting clapping and hopeful lyrics. Lauv sings 
“Know we’ve been friends / And love only knows 
broken ends,” exemplifying a kind of trust found 
in love and close relationships. 
This new song is another artifact in Lauv’s 
incomplete scrapbook of emotions. While we’ve 
already seen themes of loneliness, addiction and 
sadness, “feelings” stands out with its emphasis 
on optimism and holds onto a hope for authentic 
happiness. The divergence from Lauv’s previous 
releases will leave listeners in anticipation for 
some more of these positive feelings.

AWOL

The music video for Tyler, the Creator’s “A BOY 
IS A GUN” follows the Igor alter ego yet again 
as he wanders aimlessly, angry and exasperated 
around a lavish mansion. With a platinum bowl 
cut, black shades and pastel suits, “A BOY” ventures 
into vulnerable territory, literally and figuratively. 
Whereas “EARFQUAKE” prods more at self-defeat 
and embodies a satirical slant with its music video, 
“A BOY IS A GUN” is livid and uncertain, a cauldron 
of unresolved emotional turmoil. The narrative 
of the music video is framed in ultra-saturated, 
grainy pastel blues and greens like a distressing Wes 
Anderson film. 
True to the title, a rifle consumes the width of the 
intro frame as Tyler, the Creator cocks it back to fire 
into an aquamarine sky. He then slumps forlornly 
on a stunning white staircase only to storm onto a 
golf field and fall on his face. From here we follow a 
series of vignettes that details an ongoing argument 
between Tyler and his lover. This can easily be split 
into parts — in the first, the artist is frustrated, 
pleading with his boyfriend to “take your hoodie 
off, why you hide your face from me?” The second 
ruptures any emotional containment, oscillating 
between Tyler begging his lover to “stay right here” 
and snarling “stay the fuck away from me.” An array 

of narratives and descriptions paints these verses, 
channeling themselves directly into the video. 
Every scene and scenario, from the lovebirds 
arguing in the bathroom to Tyler, the Creator’s lover 
bringing his ex-girlfriend to breakfast, is tinged 
with unease. Tyler argues, pleads and breaks down 
but no one acknowledges his anguish and pain. The 
characters drive, pack their bags and serve dinner, 
but do so passively, with no expressions crossing 
their face. They are yielding side characters to a 
protagonist who festers in heartache and distrust, a 
visual hyperbole to Tyler’s suspicion that his words 
fall on dead ears. 
“A BOY IS A GUN” is yet another landmark to 
Tyler, the Creator’s ever-maturing persona since 
Flower Boy. It toys with his standard music video 
hallmarks, but does so poignantly and meticulously, 
the spirit of the song embodying every frame. Tyler 
deftly transfigures Igor’s wounded spirit into a 
breathtaking, visual masterpiece as it traverses 
effortlessly through his toxic, engrossing love story.

Whether we welcome it with open arms 
or try our hardest to shun it, celebrity 
culture pervades everyday life. Through 
the rise of platforms like Twitter and 
Instagram, the gap between celebrities 
and 
average 
folks 
has 
narrowed, 
strengthening the illusion that these 
millionaire stars are just like us. Perhaps 
it is this very superficial connection that 
allows “Between Two Ferns,” which is 
essentially an hour-long roast of A-list 
stars hosted by Zach Galifianakis, to 
find its audience. Though Galifianakis’s 
niche humor is a bizarre mix of silly and 
abrasive and the film’s plot is painfully 
elementary, if we fully embrace the 
absurdity we may laugh more than we 
expect to. 
It seems pointless to even provide 
a synopsis for this movie because the 
relevance of the “story” is minimal. Zach 
Galifianakis (“The Hangover”) plays a 
wacky, corporate-controlled talking head 
who dreams of hosting his own show one 
day. When business tycoon Will Ferrell 
(“Blades of Glory”) offers Galifianakis a 
chance to turn his dream into a reality, 
he and his equally peculiar crew drive 
across the country to complete a series of 
celebrity interviews under a time crunch. 
If this sounds nonsensical, that’s because 
it is. Filled with foolishness and lacking 
pacing, “Between Two Ferns” watches as 
more of a “Saturday Night Live” skit or 
a Netflix comedy special than an actual 
film.

It 
is 
questionable 
whether 
this 
spectacle can even be deemed a “movie” 
because it is so unconventional in its 
strong emphasis on comedy and disregard 
for plotline. The film targets a distinct it’s 
unlikely that Galifianakis’s goofiness will 
peak your interest. 
In terms of quality, “Between Two 
Ferns” is missing a variety of important 
elements like engaging cinematography, 
a memorable score and genuine character 
development. 
Though 
director 
Scott 
Aukerman makes it quite clear from the 
start that “Between Two Ferns” is not 
meant to follow any sort of conventional 
structure, the lack of traditional movie 
features is frustrating for any audience 
member wanting more than just snippets 
of celebrities being insulted in interviews. 

Despite its narrow intended audience, 
“Between Two Ferns” is not the worst 
option if you’re looking for an addition 
to a late-night Netflix binge. The sheer 
ridiculousness of the plotline and level 
of overall awkwardness throughout are 
enough to make anyone crack a few smiles. 
However, if you are looking to watch 
something substantial, you are definitely 
better off scrolling past Aukerman’s latest 
flick.

‘Two Ferns’ is too silly for a story

FILM REVIEW

Between Two Ferns

Netflix

Alright. So maybe the Homer Simpson animation that 
opened the show was a miss, but you know what was a 
bigger miss? “Green Book” winning Best Picture. We hope 
you enjoyed the big wins, the bits that actually landed and 
the sheen on Tony Shalhoub’s mustache. But, most of all, 
we hope you remember the times that we picked correctly, 
and that we told you so. 

Forever yours, 
The TV Beat 

Lead Actor in a Drama
The Winner: Billy Porter (“POSE”) 

Since TIME Magazine obviously isn’t going to do it, it’s 
about time we label 2019 “The Year of Billy Porter.” After 
serving a look as instantly iconic as the tuxedo gown at 
this year’s Academy Awards, most celebrities would have 
stopped. After being carried into the Met Gala by a troupe 
of beefcakes — in all gold might I add — most celebrities 
would have lost their momentum. But Billy Porter is 
not most celebrities and, if this year is any indication, he 
will not be removing his foot from the collective neck of 
America anytime soon. No, I will not take up precious time 
gloating about how I told you so, and how I just might be 
the voice of high-brow taste. But I will take up your time 
to spearhead the campaign to get Billy Porter on Disney’s 
forthcoming “The Little Mermaid” album. Not only will 
this earn him the final “G” in his quest to the elusive 
E.G.O.T (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony), but it also will 
preemptively make “The Little Mermaid,” starring Halle 
Bailey, the Blackest film of 2020. 

Lead Actress in a Limited Series 
The Winner: Michelle Williams (“Fosse/Verdon”)
The (Honorary) Most Improved: Joey King (“The Act”) 

OK. So maybe I’m not the pinnacle of high brow taste. 
I’m allowed to make mistakes! If it means anything, I am 
very satisfied that, if anyone, it was Michelle Williams that 
took home the prize for her performance as Gwen Verdon 
— even if my pick, Joey King, decisively proved herself 
to be “Most Improved.” The range, the career savvy to 
make the leap from “The Kissing Booth” to “The Act” in 
under a year should not go unnoticed. Her ability to not 

only keep up with, but to even steal scenes from living 
legend, Patricia Arquette should not go unnoticed. To 
contextualize my claim, imagine Noah Centineo holding 
his own alongside Bob Odenkirk. Now laugh because that 
would never happen. There’s always next year, Jo-Jo! 

— Ally Owens, TV Beat Editor 

Lead Actress in a Comedy
The Winner: Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Fleabag”)
The Nine-Time Emmy Winner: Julia Louis-Dreyfus 
(“Veep”)

Before this category was announced I declared that if 
Julia Louis-Dreyfus did win, I would cry. And if she didn’t 
win, I would also cry. So spoiler alert: I cried. Watching 
JLD lose in her final season as Selina Meyer, failing to 
break the record of straight wins in this category, was like 
a punch to the gut. I know this millionaire comedian has 
no idea who I am, and she sure doesn’t care who I am. 
But I really thought she had this one. That being said, if 
the winner couldn’t be JLD, I am thrilled it was another 
woman of three names, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. In fact, 
it was a huge night for PWB, taking home Lead Actress, 
Outstanding Comedy Writing and Outstanding Comedy 
Series (more on that later). Waller-Bridge crafted a 
character most women could connect to — sarcastic, sexy 
and deeply damaged. Not even Selina Meyer could rig that 
vote. 

Outstanding Comedy Series
The Winner: “Fleabag” 

May I just take this moment to say: I told you so. They 
all doubted me, they said it couldn’t happen. Yet here we 
are, the week after the Emmy’s, and “Fleabag,” a beauty 
of a show birthed from the magnificent brain of Phoebe 

Waller-Bridge, has an Emmy perched on its mantel. My 
reaction to this win? Shock, at first. As much faith as I 
had in “Fleabag,” I thought it was pretty certain the final 
season of “Veep” had this category in the bag. I would’ve 
been happy of course — “Veep” is the holy grail of which all 
comedy writing should be compared to. Yet my inevitable 
re-watch of “Fleabag” following its win has proven that 
this was not an upset nor an underdog story. There never 
has and never will be another show with the emotional 
depth yet comedic wit of “Fleabag,” and that deserves to 
be rewarded. 

— Samantha Della Fera, Senior Arts Editor 

Limited Series
The Winner: “Chernobyl” 

As I said, this category was Craig Mazin’s “Chernobyl”’s 
to lose. While I still think “Fosse/Verdon” has the better 
performances and “When They See Us” packs the most 
emotional punch, “Chernobyl” excels in all of these 
categories, from the supposedly uncannily accurate 
recreations of the Soviet era to the pilot which has a valid 
argument for being the single best episode of TV in the 
entire year. The scenes including the firefighters are as 
pathos-inducing as others are thrilling, and “Chernobyl” 
is a worthy winner even among its stiff competition. 

Lead Actor in a Comedy
The Winner: Bill Hader (“Barry”) 

That’s two years in a row now for Bill Hader’s tour 
de force performance as the titular character in HBO’s 
“Barry.” And like I said in my prediction, this probably 
wasn’t even a close vote. What impresses me the most is just 
how convincing the fundamental changes are portrayed 
in the hitman-turned-actor and how Hader sells his 
endearing awkwardness. He is supported by other skillful 
performances by Sarah Goldberg, Anthony Carrrigan and 
Henry Winkler, but as much as he has the ability to play off 
their work, the fact that Barry is still repressed internally 
and carries the darkest of secrets forces him to ultimately 
take the lead and stand above the rest.

— Sayan Ghosh, Daily New Media Editor 

Guest Actor in a Comedy Series 
The Winner: Luke Kirby (“The Marvelous Mrs. 
Maisel”) 
The Robbed: John Mulaney (“Saturday Night Live”) 

 How could this happen? Was our favorite lanky 
comedian really robbed of an Emmy even after “Bodega 
Bathroom”? Even after two successful runs on SNL? 
Sure, everyone that’s been nominated for an Emmy has 
a “winner” edge to their work, but John Mulaney should 
have been the winner. His comedy is anecdotal, but always 
has a relatable quality to it, and he’s a model for what the 
future of comedy better look like. I’m sure Luke Kirby 
did a great job, but the disappointment that comes with 
Mulaney’s loss is one that is comparable to seeing your 
favorite teacher lose the “Teacher of the Year” award. You 
really loved that teacher, but you understand that maybe 
the winner was a little more popular. With consistency, 

your favorite teacher has a real chance in the running to 
win next year.

Variety Talk Show
The Winner: “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” 
The Robbed (But Still Sexy): “The Daily Show with 
Trevor Noah” 

Let’s be honest here. Pretty much all variety talk shows 
today consist of similar material and jokes, because 99 
percent of them draw from politics. After all, the Trump 
administration gives them plenty of comedic material to 
work with, and it’s nearly impossible to avert your eyes 
from the trainwreck that is American politics. So while all 
these hosts have their own spin on the happenings of the 
day, any one of them could have won and nobody would 
have been that surprised. Since “Last Week Tonight With 
John Oliver” is on HBO, Oliver and his team can definitely 
push more boundaries in the comedy realm than the other 
networks can. So I get it. Everyone loves Trevor Noah and 
Stephen Colbert, but there wasn’t much potential for this 
category to have a huge upset anyway. They could have 
drawn the winner from a hat.

Granowicz making adjustment to college hockey

Size. Strength. Speed. School. 
The four horsemen of college 
hockey. 
And 
for 
many 
incoming 
freshmen, these elements create 
turbulence in the transition 
from junior level hockey to the 
NCAA level.
In 
a 
high-intensity 
environment where every game 
counts, freshmen Wolverines 
must learn quickly. Arriving 
on campus in September and 
kicking off the season on Oct. 6 
leaves little time for hiccups in 
the transition process. 
Michigan’s roster features 
five freshmen: Cam York, Eric 
Ciccolini, 
Johnny 
Beecher, 
Keaton 
Pehrson 
and 
Nick 
Granowicz. 
Granowicz’s path to playing 
for the Wolverines was different 
than that of teammates like 
Beecher and York. Whereas they 
spent time with the USNTDP 
he spent three seasons playing 
junior 
hockey, 
though 
not 
unusual to the world of hockey.
After graduating high school, 
he began his junior career in 
Topeka, Kan. After one-and-
a-half seasons, he moved on 
to 
Cedar 
Rapids, 
Iowa then a 
few months 
later 
to 
Merritt, 
British 
Columbia 
with 
the 
Merritt 
Centennials 
in 
the 
BCHL. 
After three years, Granowicz 
was NCAA bound. 
“For me it’s a big difference,” 
Granowicz said. “In juniors, we 
practice for about an hour (and) 
twenty. Maybe have a workout 
that day, but not for more than 
an hour and the rest of the day 
was ours to kind of hang out and 
do whatever.” 

When 
freshmen 
step 
off 
the ice, the pressure doesn’t 
cease. They have to learn how 
to balance their obligations to 
the team and in the classroom. 
Most players in junior leagues 
don’t 
take 
classes, 
which 
creates excess free time. During 
the college season, free time is a 
luxury most players don’t get to 
indulge in. There’s class. Then 
after class there’s 
practice. 
Some 
days, there’s weight 
training. Some days, 
they dedicate time 
to 
watching 
film. 
And 
then, 
there’s 
homework. 
“It’s a lot of time 
management,” 
Granowicz said. “So 
it’s like non-stop till 
8, 9 o’clock at night. 
I think it’s good to be organized 
and 
kind 
of 
focus 
with 
everything you have coming up 
in the day ahead of you, and you 
kinda gotta plan out your times. 
You don’t get really much of a 
break, and you’re always going, 
going, going.”
An increase in practice time 
isn’t the only adjustment in 

Granowicz’s 
path, 
because 
even as a 21-year-old freshman, 
he faces a size disadvantage. 
Because of players coming in 
from juniors and being older 
than traditional freshmen, he’ll 
come face-to-face with players 
as old as 24. And with age and 
size comes strength. 
“I haven’t experienced a 
college game yet,” Granowicz 
said. 
“But 
I 
know that guys 
on 
our 
team, 
they’re coming 
in 
around 
200 
pounds, 
even 
a 
little 
bit 
over, 
and 
I’m 
weighing 
in about 175. I 
know it’s more 
physical 
and 
harder. 
That’s 
why it’s the next level.”
Size is just one difference in 
competition between the junior 
level and NCAA. Speed is a 
huge factor. Play is faster. The 
intensity is higher. Players skate 
in practice with the intention of 
mirroring game conditions. 
Players are given some help 
with the transition though. 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
and the coaching staff try their 
best to help ease guys coming 
from juniors into the rhythm 
of college hockey. He counts 
on senior players like captain 
Will Lockwood, Jake Slaker 
and Michael Pastujov to take 
freshmen under their wings and 
give them guidance. 
Their advice isn’t exclusive to 
balancing classes 
and training, it 
carries over onto 
the 
ice 
during 
games. 
In 
the 
lineup, 
Pearson 
pairs 
the 
new 
players 
with 
more 
seasoned 
ones to ease the 
burden on their 
shoulders.
“(The 
freshman) just have to fit in,” 
Pearson said. “They just have 
to come in and be what they are 
and play hard. We don’t try to 
put a lot of pressure on them. 
The thing I find is they put so 
much pressure on themselves. 
(They’re) 
competitive. 
They 
wanna do well, they wanna 
please.”

Wolverines top Rutgers

The set teetered back and 
forth late in the second set, with 
neither team giving in. Rutgers 
had built an early lead, but the 
Michigan volleyball team fought 
back to gain a late lead. Then, 
sophomore outside hitter Paige 
Jones broke the tension as she 
secured the win with a kill — 
putting the Scarlet Knights at an 
insurmountable deficit. 
Jones 
bolstered 
the 
Wolverines 
offense 
and 
recorded her fourth consecutive 
double-double 
as 
Michigan 
topped Rutgers in 3 sets, (25-14, 
25-23, 25-14).
“Paige has really taken her 
game to a new level after her 
freshman year,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “She plays 
the way you would expect from 
a veteran, and she’s surrounded 
by good offensive players.”
The Wolverines not only 
played 
well 
offensively 
but 
in all aspects of the game. 
They 
outperformed 
Rutgers 
defensively 
and 
consistently 
blocked the Scarlet Knights 
— their 10 blocks were their 
second-highest 
output 
this 
season. This combination of 
strong defense and powerful 
offense 
gave 
Michigan 
the 
advantage it needed to snatch 
the win. 
At the start of the first set, 
both teams hustled to take the 
lead, but the Wolverines seized 
control at 5-4 and never trailed. 
Rutgers tried to close the gap, 
but lapses in communication 
hindered the Scarlet Knights 
from cutting into Michigan’s 
lead. 
The 
Wolverines 
— 
particularly excelling in defense 
— won, 25-14. 
“We defended well,” Rosen 
said. “Cori (Crocker) played 
particularly well. She got 6 of 
our 10 blocks. The blockers did 
a good job, and the floor fed off 
of that.” 
Michigan, lulled into security 
by the win, lost its groove at the 
start of the second set. 

“Early in the second set, we 
were sloppy,” Rosen said. “We 
did not take care of things we 
needed to, and that gave the 
other team momentum. They 
started to play at a much higher 
level. It’s a dangerous thing 
to do — to give another team 
momentum.”
Rutgers 
led 
the 
second 
set, 10-5. But the Wolverines 
chipped away at the Scarlet 
Knights’ lead and eventually 
took the advantage. The teams 
stayed within a few points of 
each other, and by the time 
the match point rolled around 
Michigan had the lead. Jones’ 
attack won the Wolverines the 
set, 25-23. 
The 
Scarlet 
Knights’ 
momentum 
dissipated 
as 
Michigan dominated the third 
set. Success blanketed the court 
for the Wolverines, especially 
offensively. 
“It’s certainly the plan to have 
a good offense,” Rosen said. “We 
have very good attackers and 
things we can do offensively 
are difficult to stop. It all comes 
from good passing.”
Michigan stayed comfortably 
ahead of Rutgers the entire set. 
From the start, it looked as if 
the Wolverines would tack on 
their seventh-straight victory 
over the Scarlet Knights. Jones 
finished the game with a kill — 
giving Michigan a win to open 
its Big Ten slate. 
“We have ambitions to win 
every match we play,” Rosen 
said. “We are just taking it day by 
day. Right now we are focusing 
on our Ohio State Sunday.” 

Michigan looking to Tokyo 2020

Three 
weeks 
into 
the 
season, Michigan swimming 
and diving has its sights set 
on success. Not only for the 
upcoming competition year, 
but also for 2020 in Tokyo.
“It’s 
an 
Olympic 
year,” 
said Wolverines coach Mike 
Bottom. “We are the only 
college pool in the country that 
has the Olympic Countdown 
Clock.”
It may be over 300 days until 
the opening ceremony in Tokyo 
Olympic Stadium, until the 
final runner lights the Olympic 
torch to commence the Games, 
but Bottom is already eager 
to gear his swimmers up for 
qualifying events.
On Friday and Saturday, 
Michigan 
(2-0) 
opened 
its 
season with a two-day dual 
meet series featuring sweeping 
victories over Navy (1-1) and 
Miami (OH) (0-2) on both the 
men’s and women’s sides.
For 
Saturday 
morning’s 
contest, which included relays 
and short swim events, the 
Canham 
Natatorium 
pool 
was extended from 25 yards, 
its 
traditional 
competition 
length, to 50 meters, the 
standard Olympic length, to 
create the long-course-style 
pool that qualifying Wolverine 
swimmers will face in Tokyo.
“We want to make sure we 
are giving our student-athletes 
a great opportunity to make 
their Olympic team,” Bottom 
said. “We’re going after it. 
We’re going after it hard.”
And indeed the Wolverines 
went after it. 
On Friday, the men powered 
past 
the 
Midshipmen 
and 
Redhawks, winning 15 of the 
16 swim events and trouncing 
their opponents, 225-75 and 
253-45, respectively.
In the diving well, the 
women swept first through 
fourth place in both the 1-meter 
and 
3-meter 
springboard 
events. Junior Ross Todd took 
first place in both events on the 
men’s side, while senior Jake 
Herremans took second.

On 
Saturday, 
with 
the 
50-meter Olympic length in 
place, the men’s and women’s 
teams won nine of 12 relays, 
with the women capturing 
first in all three freestyle relay 
events and both teams taking 
first in the 400-meter and 
800-meter medley relays. 
In the 50-meter butterfly, 
Michigan swept the podium 
with 
sophomore 
Maggie 
MacNeil 
(27.54), 
senior 
Vanessa Krause (28.77) and 
freshman Megan Glass (28.83) 
claiming first, second and third 
place. 
On 
the 
men’s side, senior 
Miles 
Smachlo 
took first place 
in the 50-meter 
fly (25.11), which 
he tallied on top 
of his first place 
finishes 
in 
the 
100-yard (47.59) 
and 
200-yard 
(1:46.59) fly from 
Friday’s meet.
Alongside Smachlo, fellow 
veterans like senior Tommy 
Cope and graduate student 
Miranda Tucker led the way 
for the Wolverines, with Cope 
and Tucker each taking first 
place in both the 100-yard and 
200-yard breaststroke for their 
respective sides on Friday. 
Cope was also a part of the first 
place 800-meter medley relay, 
while Tucker (33.67) won the 
50-meter breastroke and was 
a part of three of five winning 
women’s relays on Saturday.
“We have a whole lot of 
seniors who have been through 

the 
wars, 
and 
truthfully, 
they’re tired of not winning,” 
Bottom said. “They want to 
win and they’re leading this 
team in that direction.”
But the seniors were not the 
only ones producing. Freshman 
Kaitlynn Sims made a splashing 
debut by taking first place in 
the 500-yard (4:50.50) and 
1000-yard (9:53.49) freestyle 
races, showing great promise 
for the future of the Michigan 
women’s program.
“On the women’s side, we 
lost a big senior class last 
year, but (this 
year’s) class is 
doing a great 
job 
putting 
their 
arms 
around 
the 
freshmen and 
sophomores 
and 
getting 
them ready for 
the 
future,” 
Bottom 
said. 
“We’re trying 
to understand where we’re 
going and what our purpose is, 
who we’re doing it for. For us 
to triumph at the end (of the 
season), we’re going to have to 
work hard.”
Though the greatest trials 
and tribulations of the season 
are 
still 
on 
the 
horizon, 
and Tokyo remains far in 
the 
distance, 
the 
Olympic 
countdown clock in Canham 
Natatorium ticks away in the 
background as the Wolverines 
hop in the pool each day.
They can hear it, and they 
are working.

Reed propels ‘M’ past Kent State

On two penalty corners, Kayla 
Reed was positioned in the same 
spot, right in front of the right 
post. Both times, it resulted in 
the junior midfielder finding the 
back of the net for two of the 
No. 9 Michigan women’s field 
hockey team’s (5-2) four goals in 
a 4-0 win over Kent State (4-5) on 
Sunday.
Reed’s first goal came in the 
second minute of the second 
quarter, on the fourth of a stretch 
of 
four 
consecutive 
corners. 
Senior midfielder Kay Feijer 
made a pass off the corner to 
junior defender Halle O’Neill, 
who found Reed. Reed dove to get 
a stick on the ball and redirected 
it into the net.
The second came just six 
minutes later, and looked almost 
identical. This time, sophomore 
midfielder 
Kathryn 
Peterson 
made the initial pass to O’Neill, 
whose pass went straight to 
the stick of Reed for an easy 
redirection goal.
“Definitely over the last three 
years it’s been a go-to corner play 
for us,” Reed said. “I feel like if 
you look back on the stats, it’s one 
of our most scored corners.”
Throughout the game, keeping 
possession was an important 
factor for the Wolverines. In the 

first quarter, they constantly 
played in Kent State territory, 
but had difficulty getting passes 
to the center and getting shots 
on net. Michigan broke through 
in the second half, when the four 
consecutive penalty corners and 
Reed’s goal gave it momentum, 
and went on to attempt 22 shots.
“It’s always important to keep 
possession,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We’re always 
working on it and I thought today 
we did quite a good job.”
After 
taking 
a 
2-0 
lead 
into halftime, the Wolverines 
switched into more of a defensive 
mode in the second half. While the 
Golden Flashes were not getting 
many 
scoring 
opportunities 
in the first half, 
they 
had 
even 
fewer 
in 
the 
second. Michigan 
held them to no 
attempted 
shots 
in the second half, 
and only three in 
the entire game.
“I was proud of 
our team defense,” 
Pankratz said. “I thought we 
stepped up and intercepted well.”
The fourth quarter may have 
been the Wolverines’ most sound 
quarter from both an offensive 
and defensive standpoint. They 
continued to stifle Kent State 

defensively, and they consistently 
threatened in the offensive zone. 
Sophomore 
midfielder 
Sofia 
Southam added to Michigan’s 
lead with a high goal off her own 
rebound within the first thirty 
seconds of the quarter, and senior 
midfielder Guadalupe Fernandez 
Lacort tallied the final goal for 
the Wolverines with ten minutes 
remaining.
“I thought our team worked 
really hard,” Pankratz said. “We 
had to be very disciplined and 
organized today and I thought we 
were.”
The win marks Michigan’s 
fourth in a row, giving the 
Wolverines a sizable amount of 
momentum 
going into the 
start of the Big 
Ten season on 
Friday. 
Their 
difficult 
non-
conference 
schedule, 
including 
four 
ranked 
opponents, has 
made 
them 
confident 
that 
they can compete with the best of 
the best.
“I think we feel prepared,” 
Pankratz said. “It’s by design that 
we play a tough pre-conference 
schedule to play against the best, 
to improve and see where we are.”

J

osh Gattis told his players a 
story this week.
He recalled a time, three 
years ago, when his Penn State 
group sputtered out of the gate. 
The Nittany Lions lost by three 
to Pittsburgh early in the year, 
before traveling on the road and 
getting shellacked by Michigan, 
49-10. They 
took that 
adversity and 
responded, 
ripping off 
nine straight 
wins en route 
to a Big Ten 
title and a 
Rose Bowl 
appearance.
The under-
lying parallels 
to this Wolverines group were 
clear: a talented team, a scuffle 
out of the gate, a sobering road 
loss, a moment of reflection. It is 
possible, the thinking goes, for 
this team to respond and make 
something of this year.
“Sometimes adversity is some-
thing that you never want to 
use to bond your guys together,” 
Gattis said Wednesday, “but it’s 
something that forms a bond.”
For Josh Gattis, crucially, that 
is where the 2016 Penn State 
parallels diverge. He is not a 
mere wide receivers coach. This 
is his offense. It has been from 
the moment he took the job. And 
with that the responsibility of its 
failures. 
“Being the guy that’s in 
charge, I hurt when I’m not able 
to see those guys have that suc-
cess,” Gattis said. “I take it very 
personal just as (the players) take 
it personal.”
After three weeks, Gattis’ 
offense, expected to bring the 
dawn of a new era, has appeared 
to be some combination of ill-
conceived and ill-prepared. The 
unit showed signs of vertical 
ability against Middle Tennessee 
State, but ultimately struggled to 
sustain consistency throughout 
the game. Against Army, the 

offense was suddenly devoid of 
the creativity it promised, ham-
mering inside zone into oblivion. 
Last week against Wisconsin, 
the Wolverines failed to convert 
a third down for the first time 
since at least 1995. Through 
three weeks, Michigan is 116th 
of 130 teams in yards gained, 91st 
in points and 104th in offensive 
efficiency, according to ESPN. 
Nine turnovers haven’t helped, 
either.
But if you’ve watched any 
significant portion of the Wol-
verines’ first three games, you 
don’t need that empirical data to 
parse through what’s painfully 
obvious: This offense has been 
a mess.
The promised spread has 
turned into muddled ineptitude. 
The impending RPO cascade has 
bewildered its signal-caller, Shea 
Patterson, not to mention imper-
iled his health. All the while, the 
most talented weapons on the 
offense have been indisputably 
underutilized. To an untrained 
eye, Gattis appears to have out-
smarted himself. The result is a 
unit that, even its own players 
say, has no discernible identity. 
Sometimes a cute hashtag is 
just that.
And now, Gattis faces a 
moment of truth — a point of 
inflection, perhaps. A dose of 
reality, no doubt. Asked Tuesday 
whether anything has taken him 
by surprise in his first few weeks 
as an offensive coordinator, he 
offered a rhetorical chuckle.
“A lot,” Gattis said.
If the bye week hadn’t already 
done so, the 35-14 drubbing at 
Wisconsin on Saturday poured 
cold water on the hype. Monday, 
Gattis put together a 100-play 
cut-up, both for his own viewing 
and ultimately to pass along to 
players. It included every nega-
tive play the unit has accrued 
thus far. For each play, he 
showed his team what happens 
when it’s run correctly and what 
happens when it isn’t.
“For us, offensively, it’s a 

consistency deal,” Gattis said. 
“There hasn’t been a lot thrown 
at them that they haven’t pre-
viously had experience with. 
There’s some things that we’re 
still carrying over from last 
year.”
On Monday, Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh did not waver on 
his faith in his new offensive 
play-caller. It’s clear, for what-
ever it’s worth, that Gattis hasn’t 
lost faith in himself, either. 
There is a learning curve to 
all of this — calling plays, direct-
ing an offense — that Gattis 
never had the luxury to adjust 
to. When you’re pegged as the 
savior of a woebegone unit, the 
vessel through which this pro-
gram intended to enter the mod-
ern era, that pressure mounts 
quickly.
Still, even the most staunch 
pessimists couldn’t have seen 
that breaking point come this 
early.
To Gattis’ credit, he stood in 
front of the media Wednesday 
and answered every question. He 
didn’t deflect. Didn’t excuse any-
thing. He assumed the blame, 
and assured they’d turn things 
around. At this point, it would 
be as unwise to relinquish hope 
in Gattis as it would to assume a 
breakthrough is imminent.
Sure, this team could be a 
redux of 2016 Penn State. It 
could just as easily mirror the 
2017 Michigan team that went 
8-5, a low point of the Harbaugh 
era.
“When you go through the 
pressure situation, it only makes 
you tighter,” Gattis said. “I 
believe in every single one of our 
players.”
The real question now, 
though, is whether those players 
feel the same about him. Because 
if they don’t, this house of cards 
will come tumbling down sooner 
than later.

A moment of truth for Gattis

Amid questions, Gattis keeps faith

At times when Josh Gattis spoke 
on Wednesday, it seemed his every 
other word was “adversity.” Over 22 
minutes, he used the word nearly 
15 times. During one 25-second 
stretch, he used it four times.
It was when he got asked if there 
were any surprises over his first 
three weeks.
And when you come in the way 
Gattis did as Michigan’s offensive 
coordinator 
and 
perform 
the 
way he has — overpromising and 
underdelivering 
through 
three 
grueling weeks of offensive football 
— what else is there to do besides 
fall back on the language of cliches 
and overcoming challenges?
“We ran what we wanted to run,” 
Gattis said. “The thing is, we just 
didn’t capitalize on the plays that 
we had in front of us.”
This comes just a couple days 
after multiple offensive players 
brought up questions about identity, 
saying they were uncomfortable 
throwing the ball as many times as 
Michigan did on Saturday. A large 
portion of that likely isn’t what 
Gattis had planned — once the 
Badgers got out to a big lead, there 
was little choice but throw the ball 
— but it’s still hard to comport that 
statement from Gattis with what 
Jon Runyan Jr. said on Monday. 
“Once you get knocked back on 
our heels like that during the game, 
we kinda have to stray away from 
(the plan),” Runyan said. “… We 
were throwing the ball 42 times 
that game, which is something I 
haven’t seen at Michigan since I’ve 
been here.”
While the rest of the Wolverines 
are in the midst of an existential 
crisis 
post-Saturday’s 
35-14 
drubbing at the hands of Wisconsin, 
Gattis 
tried 
to 
convey 
some 
semblance of confidence. He took 
responsibility for the issues, but 
like he did after a disappointing 
performance against Army, he 
pointed to turnovers as the biggest 
part of the problem. He said 
Michigan left plays on the field. He 
stressed consistency.
He’s not wrong in any of that. 
The 
conversation 
surrounding 
Michigan right now would be 
drastically different if it hadn’t 

turned the ball over nine times in 
three games. Things would be a lot 
better if the Wolverines executed in 
games the same way they purport to 
do so in practice. Consistency folds 
into all of that — and so do injuries, 
as Gattis said his unit has yet to 
practice with all 11 starters.
But 
the 
questions 
outside 
the building have turned to the 
viability of the system itself. Senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson is 
averaging 7.0 yards per attempt, 
down a full yard from last season. 
The offensive line has struggled 
to open up holes in the run game. 
Junior receiver Nico Collins, who 
seemed destined to take a leap, 
has eight catches — most of little 
consequence — through three 
games, and has rarely been involved.
When Michigan reached third 
down on its first drive of the fourth 
quarter on Saturday, Collins ran 
straight past his man, into open 
space. Instead of hitting the open 
man downfield, Patterson threw to 
Ronnie Bell in double coverage, just 
short of the sticks. Collins threw his 
hands as the ball fell incomplete.
“I don’t think you can look 
out there and say one person was 
frustrated,” Gattis said. “I think 
all 
together, 
including 
myself, 
offensively, we were frustrated.”
Still, that doesn’t change what 
everyone can see. The receiving 
group as a whole — which figured to 
be a massive strength with Collins, 
Tarik Black and Donovan Peoples-
Jones, who returned from injury 
Saturday — has underwhelmed.
“We’re not where we need to be 
in that room,” Gattis said. “That 
falls on me.”
Doubtless, that wasn’t what 
Gattis envisioned himself saying 
to a room of reporters about his 
most talented position group a few 
days before a game against Rutgers 
that should be chalked up as an 
automatic win.
On Monday, Gattis put together 
tape of 100 plays — all the negative 
plays Michigan has had — and 
watched it with the players. Then 
he showed them how those plays 
would look when they worked.
But practice and film rooms, as 
Gattis has found out the hard way, 
is different from games.
And regardless of where that 
disparity comes from, it’s his to fix.
