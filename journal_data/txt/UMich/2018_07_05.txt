Schlissel issues response to 
SCOTUS travel ban ruling

U-M condemns 
upholding of ban, 
student orgs rally

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
released 
a 
statement 
June 26 condemning the Supreme 
Court’s decision to uphold President 
Donald Trump’s travel ban on seven 
countries, the majority of which are 
predominantly Muslim.
In the response, Schlissel wrote 
the University is proud to be one of 
more than 30 American universities to 
have filed a joint amicus brief, or legal 
document submitted by non-litigants, 
with the Supreme Court regarding 
the travel ban. Filed in March, the 
brief argues the travel ban prevents 
institutions from recruiting talented 
international scholars.
Schlissel also wrote the University’s 
international population, comprising 
students from 128 countries, enriches 

the 
institution 
culturally 
and 
academically.
“Diminishing the quality and 
breadth of our academic community 
will threaten the aspirations for peace 
and prosperity we all share,” Schlissel 
wrote. “We will continue to admit 
students in a manner consistent with 
our non-discrimination policy, and to 
those who have earned their place here, 
we remain committed to fostering an 
environment where all can flourish.”
According to Donya Khadem, 
a 
co-director 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Immigration 
and 
Labor 
Law 
Association, the travel ban is troubling 
because 
international 
students 
are a crucial part of the University 
community for a variety of reasons.
“There are roughly, I think, a million 
international students in the U.S. at 
colleges and universities and they add 
not only to the intellectual value of our 
country, but they also add a lot to the 
economic product of the university,” 
Khadem said. “They pay money to 
come, so the school is affected not only 
by being not able to recruit enough talent 
when this happens, but also financially.”

Khadem also said international 
faculty are a valuable asset to 
institutions of higher education because 
their backgrounds can enhance their 
teaching.
Schlissel was one of the first 
university presidents to respond to the 
initial executive order, signed by Trump 
in January 2017
, that blocked travel 
from seven Muslim-majority countries. 
He maintained the University would 
only 
release 
immigration 
status 
information when required by federal 
law and emphasized the University’s 
commitment to supporting students 
regardless of their immigration status.
LSA senior Yezeñia Sandoval, the 
external director of Latino student 
organization La Casa, shared with 
The Daily an official statement 
she wrote on behalf of La Casa 
in response to the travel ban. In 
the statement, Sandoval praised 
Schlissel for committing to not 
releasing immigration status unless 
absolutely necessary, but said the 
University can still improve in 
terms of inclusion.

Man charged 
in Sharp case

Police arrest suspected 
killer of retired U-M prof

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

A man has been charged in the 
homicide of 77-year-old Robert Sharp, a 
retired University of Michigan chemistry 
professor.
The suspect, Isom Martez-Nygel 
Hamilton,was arraigned in Washtenaw 
County court Friday on charges of open 
murder, armed robbery, first-degree 
arson, first-degree home invasion and 
mutiliation of a dead body. 29-year-old 
Hamilton was arrested in connection 
with Sharp’s death on June 11.
Sharp 
taught 
chemistry 
at 
the 
University for 39 years before retiring 
in 2008. Police discovered Sharp’s body 
after a welfare check was requested for 
him by a neighbor after he failed to show 
up to a community meeting.
Hamilton had been on parole since 
November 2017 for assault of a police 
officer, possession of a dangerous weapon 
and first-degree arson, after serving four 
years in prison for the charges. 
Hamilton worked at a Wendy’s 
restaurant 
that 
Sharp 
frequented. 
According to MLive, Hamilton had 
burglarized Sharp’s home several times, 
including stealing Sharp’s wallet and 
computer.
After allegedly murdering Sharp, 
Hamilton attempted to burn Sharp’s 
body to cover his tracks. The officers who 
performed the welfare check observed 
heavy smoke residue in the home and 
found Sharp in the basement of his home 
on Alpine Drive. The U.S. Marshals 
helped police track down their suspect.
Hamilton is currently being held 
without bond and will have a preliminary 
examination on July 19.

Police task force 
addresses brutality

Citizens identify 
policy issues around 
police violence

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

The city of Ann Arbor held a 
Police Task Force meeting Thursday 
evening to discuss and suggest revisions 
of the policy regarding the Ann Arbor 
Police Review Board. 
City Council had finalized the creation 
of a task force in March to create higher 
accountability for the Ann Arbor Police 
Department. Area residents had called on 
the city to create the task force after police 
brutality incidents occurred in the city, 
including the 2014 shooting death of Aura 
Rosser and the arrest of Ciaeem Slaton at 
the Blake Transit Center in September.
Richard Friedman, co-chair of the 
Police Task Force, explained Thursday’s 
meeting specifically hoped to address 
the review board’s role in incident 
review, especially with the recent Blind 
Oig restaurant incident. The previous 
weekend, a Black man was arrested after 
a fight intiated by a white man broke out. 

The Black man was the only indivdual 
arrested during the incident.
“As a task force, we don’t have any role 
to investigate this,” Friedman said. “But, 
this is the type of incident for which the 
commission we’re working on is designed 
to address, I think. We hope that it will 
have a good review process to address 
incidents like that.”
Transforming Justice Washtenaw and 
the Collective Against White Supremacy 
both submitted revision requests for the 
commission’s establishment.
TJW members Maren Spolem and 
Julie Quiroz addressed TJW support 
of the commission but raised concerns 
regarding what the commission sees the 
core issue to be.
“TJW is committed to the creation 
of 
a 
police 
commission 
that 
is 
independent, 
transparent, 
representative 
and 
adequately 
funded,” Spolem said. “We’ve 
reviewed your template and while 
there are many points in the 
template with which we agree, 
fundamental differences remain.

Candidate discusses 
his campaign for 
state governor 

By GRACE KAY 

Summer Managing News Editor 

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM 

Summer Daily News Editor 

Editor’s 
Note: 
The 
Michigan 
Daily does not officially endorse 
Patrick Colbeck for governor. The 
Daily continues to reach out to 
other gubernatorial candidates for 
comments and interviews.
The Daily recently met with 
Michigan 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Patrick Colbeck to discuss his platform 
and goals if elected. Colbeck is running 
against Attorney General Bill Schuette, 
Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and Jim Hines for 
the Republican candidacy. The primary 
election is set to take place Aug. 7.
Colbeck says he is the only 
Republican candidate who can beat 
the Democrats in the general election, 
emphasizing his grassroot support.
“I can win the general election,” 
Colbeck said. “There’s not going to be too 
much enthusiasm to go get out the vote 
in the general election and, frankly, the 
Michigan Democratic Party chair talks 
about me being the biggest threat to the 
Democrats in the general election.” 
Colbeck says despite the media 
attention 
focused 
on 
opponents 
Schuette and Calley, he is willing to go 
beyond merely performing one-minute 
sound bites to provide detailed strategies 

and implement solutions.
“I’m an engineer so I actually solve 
problems,” Colbeck said. “Everybody 
else, they’re much better speakers. I 
had my one technical speaking course 
at Michigan but that was about it. The 
key is people are looking for someone 
who can solve problems and whatever 
the policy issue across the board is, I’ve 
demonstrated that I can go into the 
details on any of the different policy 
issues that we’re facing at the state 
level and I can find solutions to those 
problems.”
“Mixing things up” 
Colbeck says voters are ready for 
something new, because they are tired 
of “politics as usual.” Colbeck believes 
he can bring authenticity to his role and 
implement real solutions to problems in 
Michigan such as poor education, bad 
roads and high taxes.
“When you talk about fixing the 
roads, I don’t frame the problem for 
58 seconds out of a one-minute reply 
and then have a two second response 
on how to fix it. I actually spend all my 
time, probably talking too fast trying to 
squeeze it into a minute, and say, ‘Here’s 
the solution,’” Colbeck said. “I’ve gotten 
people that have declared Independent 
or Democrat that come up and want to 
support my campaign because they’re 
tired of people with the marketing 
blitz and not any substance. So, the big 
differentiator and the way I set up is that 
I’ve got substance in my narrative and in 
my solutions.”

U-M awarded for campus 

health and safety efforts

National org 
commends work 
against sex assault, 
alcohol abuse

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan was 
awarded two Prevention Excellence 
Awards by the Campus Prevention 
Network in recognition of the Uni-
versity’s efforts in sexual assault 
and alcohol abuse prevention. The 
annual meeting was held on June 8 
in New Orleans.
The Campus Prevention Net-
work supports large college cam-
puses across the United States in 
their efforts to address health and 
safety challenges including sexual 
assault and high-risk alcohol con-
sumption.
“By 
providing 
innovative 
research, proven and promising 
prevention strategies, and oppor-
tunities to engage and benefit from 
the collective wisdom of peers, the 
Campus Prevention Network is 
uniquely positioned to help campus-
es make breakthrough progress on 
the critical health and safety issues 
impacting the lives of our students, 
staff, and faculty,” the Campus Pre-
vention Network mission statement 
says.
In being recognized by both 
awards in the same year, the Uni-
versity stands out as one of the insti-
tutions at the forefront of sexual 
assault and alcohol abuse preven-
tion.
“Of the 133 colleges and universi-
ties that have completed the sexual 
assault inventory and the 112 that 
have completed the alcohol inven-
tory, fewer than 10 percent earned 
the distinction of being a Preven-
tion Excellence Award honoree,” 
according to The University Record.
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald stressed the importance 
of these issues and expressed the 
gratitude the University feels in 
being recognized for its efforts.
“Sexual assault and alcohol abuse 
are two very important issues facing 
college students across the nation,” 
Fitzgerald said. “For U-M to be rec-
ognized on the national level for its 
prevention education and program-
ming is a real honor.”

Fitzgerald also pointed out that 
it is the people who work hard in 
making the University a safe place 
for everyone that ultimately deserve 
the credit for their work.
“It’s important recognition of the 
commitment of our staff, faculty and 
students involved in this ongoing 
work to educate our community on 
ways to reduce harm and improve 
safety of the Ann Arbor campus 
community,” Fitzgerald said
These efforts include the Com-
munity Matters programs, which 
all incoming students must com-
plete. These programs provide 
students with information and 
learning opportunities concern-
ing alcohol and other drugs, sex-
ual assault, healthy relationships, 
bystander intervention and campus 
policies and resources.
The University’s Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
is dedicated to fostering a respectful 
and safe environment for all mem-
bers of the University’s community. 
The staff and student volunteers 
engage in programs that support 
those who have been impacted by 
sexual assault, intimate partner vio-
lence, sexual harassment and stalk-
ing.
“These awards remind us that 
our work to create healthy and safe 
communities takes intention, dedi-
cation and collaboration,” SAPAC 
Director Kaaren Williamsen said 
in a University Record article. “Our 
partnerships throughout Student 
Life, and collaborations with stu-
dents, student organizations, fac-
ulty, staff and community partners, 
are key to making sure our pro-
grams are effective and responsive 
to the needs of our campus.”
University Health Service dedi-
cates much of their time to alcohol 
abuse prevention and participates 
in many programs, including Stay 
in the Blue and BASICS-IMEP. 
BASICS-IMEP Director Marsha 
Benz, who is also a motivational 
interviewing trainer and UHS Plan-
et Blue lead, commented it was nice 
to receive validation for their efforts 
and that it would inspire their work 
going forward and continue to 
engage with the commu-
nity. 

Republican candidates argue over 
Michigan’s future in final debate

By GRACE KAY 

Summer Managing News Editor 

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM 

Summer Daily News Editor 

Michigan’s four Republican 
gubernatorial candidates gath-
ered Thursday night at WDIV-
TV in Detroit for their final 
debate before the Aug. 7 prima-
ries, 
discussing 
immigration 
policies, gun violence, income 
tax regulations and economic 
growth.
Despite having similar plat-
forms, Attorney General Bill 
Schuette, Lt. Gov. Brian Cal-
ley, state Sen. Patrick Colbeck 
and physician Jim Hines butted 
heads over their professional 
histories, Trump’s endorsement 
of Schuette and their plans for 
improving education and infra-
structure in Michigan.
Moderator 
Devin 
Scillian 
launched the debate, asking the 
candidates to present opening 
remarks. Calley, who currently 
holds second place to Schuette 
in the polls, highlighted his 
experience working with incum-
bent Gov. Rick Snyder, saying he 
helped cut taxes and led Detroit 
out of bankruptcy. He also criti-
cized Schuette for relying too 
heavily on President Trump’s 
endorsement.
Schuette defended himself, 
explaining 
Trump 
supports 
him as a gubernatorial candi-
date because he will continue to 
cut taxes. While Calley seemed 
to dismiss Trump’s support of 
Schuette, Schuette responded it 
should be a defining reason for 

voter support.
“The endorsement of Presi-
dent Trump, I’d call that huge,” 
Schuette said.
Meanwhile, Colbeck said even 
though the media seems to only 
highlight Schuette and Calley, 
he is the only Republican candi-
date who can truly challenge the 
Democrats.
“There’s no enthusiasm for 
them besides the media and the 
politicos,” Colbeck said.
Hines described himself as an 
outsider, noting the other can-
didates are term-limited, career 
politicians.
Gun violence
In light of Thursday’s shooting 
in Annapolis, Maryland, Scillian 
asked the candidates to comment 
on gun safety.
All the candidates stressed 
their support for the Second 
Amendment, with Schuette not-
ing his membership in the NRA. 
The candidates all brought up 
the idea that criminals, not guns, 
are the real problem.
“One thing I know for sure it 
that you can’t stop violence from 
criminals by going after law-
abiding citizens,” Calley said. 
“We have to get to the heart of 
the problem here.”
Both 
Colbeck 
and 
Calley 
said the state needs to make its 
schools more shooting-resistant. 
Colbeck proposed eliminating 
gun-free zones in schools, saying 
they increase the risk for a mass 
shooting.
Schuette said mass shootings 
are a result of the mental health 
crisis in America.
“The Democrats and Whit-

mer will take guns away from 
law-abiding citizens and that is 
wrong,” Schuette said.
Immigration
Addressing another nation-
wide crisis, Scillian brought the 
immigration debate into the 
conversation. All the candidates 
expressed discomfort with the 
concept of separating children 
from their parents but supported 
strong borders.
“We need to secure the border, 
and we can even build a wall,” 
Calley said. “But separating kids 
from their parents, that’s just not 
who we are.”
Colbeck and Schuette spoke 
out against sanctuary cities.
“If the Democrats had their 
way they would make the entire 
state of Michigan a sanctuary 
state,” Schuette said.
Colbeck added sanctuary cit-
ies should not be tolerated in the 
state of Michigan.
Education
The 
candidates 
discussed 
Michigan’s troubling drop in 
performance in public schools 
and outlined their plans for 
improving the state’s education 
system.
“Money will not solve this 
problem,” Hines said. “We need 
to go back to the basics.”
Hines iterated a common 
theme of the night, a need for a 
higher standard for education in 
Michigan, saying the state needs 
to eliminate the Common Core 
and implement reading coaches 
in the classroom.

Y

ou 
know 
that 
episode 
of “Barbie: Life in the 
Dreamhouse” where Malibu 
has a glitter shortage and all hell 
breaks loose because Barbie is 
supposed to attend a Hollywood 
premiere that night and she doesn’t 
want her fans to see her without 
any glitter? I feel like that’s a pretty 
accurate depiction of how my 
summer’s gone so far. 
My 
“dreamhouse” 
is 
a 
little 
apartment on Central Campus, and 
toward the end of the school year, 
my roommates and I began to allow 
ourselves to consider the prospect of 
summer. Summer. The word itself 
drips with glitter. We all have jobs and 
internships, of course, but we’re used to 
being at the library until the early hours 
of the morning every single day. When 
you can’t remember the last time you 
got seven hours of sleep without feeling 
guilty about it, the idea of having 
nights and evenings completely void of 
homework sounds like something out 
of a fairytale.
But now summer’s here. We’re 
almost two months in, actually. And 
though our shoulders are tanner and 
our living room is packed to the brim 
with box fans we bought from CVS, 
it doesn’t really feel like summer. 
Day-to-day life doesn’t live up to the 
anticipation that the word “summer” 
carries.
Why? My theory is that the 
University of Michigan has a glitter 
shortage.
When I was in seventh grade, my 
mom told me I could practice wearing 
makeup. I couldn’t wear it to school, 
but I could wear it around the house. 

Naturally, I spent hours at the family 
computer watching tutorials from 
girls with usernames like juicystar07 
and itsbl0ndie. When my mom went 
grocery shopping, I tagged along to 
journey through the cosmetics aisle. I 
used crumpled $5 bills I’d earned from 
babysitting to pay for pink lipstick and 
blue eyeliner.
The first time I was finally allowed 
to wear makeup to school, I covered my 
eyelids with silver glitter, just like I’d 
practiced so many times before. I felt 
glamorous all day. I wasn’t just another 
gangling, awkward middle schooler. I 
had created art on my face that showed 
I was a stylish, dazzling it-girl.
Well, last night, I sat cross-legged 
in front of the full-length mirror 
in my bedroom and listened to my 
roommates laughing and singing as 
I put on my makeup. Foundation. 
Concealer. Blush. Eyebrow gel. Black 
eyeshadow to create the illusion of 
longer lashes. Thick, dark mascara 
that my mom got me for Christmas. No 
glitter. Not even a drop.
I’m finally old enough to wear 
whatever I want and I don’t even wear 
any glitter? Come on. Adulthood is a 
total rip-off.
During our walk down South 
University Avenue on the way home 
after our glitterless night out, my 
roommate, Shannon, and I asked 
ourselves why it doesn’t feel like 
summer yet.
“It feels like we’re just waiting for 
summer to start,” she said. “Like it’s 
going to be fun and exciting and full of 
adventure, but it just hasn’t happened 
yet.”
“I think we’re still trying to figure 

out who we are beyond homework,” I 
said. “’Cause during the school year, all 
we did was study and go to class and we 
never had to figure out who we were 
and what we wanted to do. And now 
that we have the time to do that, we’re 
just lost.”
I wouldn’t say that seventh grade 
was the highlight of my existence, but 
that may be the last time my identity 
came from myself and not from my 
grades or my job or my resume. I knew 
what I wanted. I wanted more followers 
on my Justin Bieber fan account on 
Twitter and I wanted to wear as much 
glitter as humanly possible. Now, all I 
want is good grades, and when classes 
end and I no longer have an ability to 
earn good grades, I don’t know what I 
want. How sad is that?
The thing is, I’m not the only one 
who deep down inside is meant to 
be wearing glitter. How do I know 
this? Because if you walked down the 
hallways of Mill Creek Middle School 
in 2010, I wasn’t the only one with 
glittery eyelids. I wasn’t the only one 
whose first taste of independence was 
the ability to wear as much glitter as I 
wanted. Before we started spending 
every spare moment in the library, we 
all used to daydream about being glitzy 
and glamorous. When did we become 
so boring?
It doesn’t feel like summer yet 
because I’m glitter-deficient. That’s 
bad news. The good news? You can buy 
glitter eyeshadow on Amazon for $3. 
Anyone want me to order some for you?

was 
the 
decision 
handed 
down 
by the Court in Masterpiece 
Cakeshop 
v. 
Colorado 
Civil 
Rights 
Commission, 
a 
case 
whose implications were eagerly 
anticipated when the Supreme 
Court heard arguments late 
last year. The Court’s 7-2 ruling 
in favor of baker Jack Phillips 
of 
Masterpiece 
Cakeshop, 
who in 2014 refused to serve 
a same-sex couple, failed to 
produce a conclusive standard 
for 
the 
balance 
between 
religious freedom and anti-
discrimination protection.
Regardless of future action, 
there 
remains 
an 
issue 
of 
greater 
interest 
that 
goes 
beyond the Colorado cakeshop 
and the gay couple to whom it 
denied its services: that even in 
Colorado – one of only 20 states 
that protects LGBT citizens 
from discrimination by public 
accommodations – a couple like 
Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins 
could be so plainly deprived 
of their civil rights and then 
be rejected after taking their 
case to court. Following the 
progression (or lack thereof) of 
the litigation, it soon becomes 
impossible to dismiss the great 
injustice of the status quo. More 
than anything, the Masterpiece 
Cakeshop case demonstrates the 
need to define sexual orientation 
as a federally protected class.
Conflict ensued shortly after 
Craig and Mullins, a same-sex 
couple seeking a cake that would 
suit their marriage ceremony, 
found themselves at the counter 
of Masterpiece Cakeshop. The 
bakery was headed by Phillips, 
a devout evangelical Christian 
who refused to make the couple 
one of his bespoke wedding 
cakes on the basis of Craig and 
Mullin’s sexual orientation.
Namely, 
Phillips’ 
counsel 
sought 
to 
obfuscate 
his 
impropriety 
by 
framing 
the case as one of stifled 
personal 
expression, 
with 
Phillips as a victim at the 
hands of the Colorado Civil 
Rights 
Commission. 
The 

Court’s 
conservative 
justices 
generally concurred, judging 
the 
Masterpiece 
Cakeshop 
incident along the lines of a 
similar Colorado case wherein a 
customer brought a cake design 
bearing 
an 
anti-homosexual 
message to a bakery, but baker 
Marjorie Silva’s refusal to fulfill 
his order was upheld.

The 
justices’ 
cry 
to 
the 
supposed 
double 
standard 
the 
Silva 
case 
presents, 
however, 
amounts 
to 
little 
more than conservative self-
pity. The Colorado Civil Rights 
Commission sided with Silva 
precisely because she would 
have refused the customer’s 
same design request to any 
customer. It is not relevant that 
the man requesting the cake’s 
message was doing so in light of 
his own religious beliefs – it was 
the simply the content of the 
message, not the identity of the 
customer, that disgusted Silva, a 
characterization proven by the 
fact that she offered to sell him a 
plain cake and icing bag later so 
he could implement the design 
himself.
Phillips, on the other hand, 
based his refusal to serve Craig 
and Mullins solely on the basis 
of their identity. As dissenting 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg pointed out, 
Craig and Mullins were not 
even able to arrive at their 
proposed design before Phillips 
rejected them. This proves that 
Phillips’ rationale lay with the 
identity of his customers and 
not with the content of any 
services they had requested of

ewton’s 
third 
law 
of 
motion states every action 
has an equal and opposite 
reaction. It implies forces always 
exist in pairs. For example, if you 
attempt to push a car uphill in 
neutral, you can feel it pushing 
back against you with the same 
force in the opposite direction. 
Ever jump off a pool raft? I bet 
as you lurched forward, the raft 
recoiled 
backwards. 
Action, 
reaction.
President 
Donald 
Trump, 
along with the University of 
Michigan 
and 
several 
of 
its 
student organizations, seem to be 
overlooking this simple, axiomatic 
doctrine. Last week, the Trump 
administration 
joined 
national 
advocacy group Speech First in its 
lawsuit against the school’s bias 
response policy, claiming the rules 
wrongly supervise free speech 
and limit conservative student 
expression on campus.
One event that comes to mind 
occurred earlier this academic 
year when several U-M students 
slapped 
on 
the 
firetruck-red, 
infamous “Make America Great 
Again” hats, which I’ve come to 
understand 
as 
an 
unspecified 
invitation—a symbol that suggests, 
“Yes, I support Trump and I 
understand you may not, but I 
invite you to engage in a political 
debate, one in which neither of us 
will win because both of us have 
rigid, deep-rooted political and 
social views.” So these students 
squatted in the Diag, the sunny 
square of Central Campus that 
is used as a shortcut to most 
destinations, 
and 
expressed 
their right allocated in the First 
Amendment, the privilege of free 
speech.
They exuded their unspoken yet 
implicit political opinions, which 
were later clarified by New York 
Times writer Anemona Hartocollis 
to include “that abortion after 12 
weeks is murder; that the welfare 
system is being abused; that 
there should be a border wall and 
that the wage gap between men 
and women is based on women’s 
choices, not discrimination.” It’s as 
if they did research on today’s most 
contentious debates and put on a 
hat to declare their positions on 
the matters; they sowed the seeds 
of controversy, sat back and waited 
for them to sprout.
According to Hartocollis, at the 
end of the day, after being called 
“racist or, in one case, shoved and 

spat on, for supporting President 
Trump,” the students in question 
felt penalized for engaging in free 
speech and abused for expressing 
their views, particularly by the 
University’s Bias Response Team. 
According to the team’s website, 
it addresses “incidents that may 
reflect bias against members of the 
University community based on 
their identity.” The team became 
involved in this free speech case 
after a significant surge in incident 
reports, 
which 
represents 
an 
increase in students seeking its 
support.
The 
Bias 
Response 
Team 
defines bias as “conduct that 
discriminates, 
stereotypes, 
excludes, 
harasses 
or 
harms 
anyone in our community based 
on their identity (such as race, 
color, ethnicity, national origin, 
sex, gender identity or expression, 
sexual orientation, disability, age, 
or religion).” The Team, which is 
not unique to Michigan’s campus, 
interpreted the aforementioned 
behavior – wearing red nationalist 
hats 
and 
instigating 
political 
friction – as offensive, as “bias.” 
The hat-wearers recognized that 
these carefully worded policies 
were being misused to punish 
them for their actions; in a greater 
sense, conservative students in 
support of the hat-wearers felt 
disproportionately 
deterred 
from expressing their opinions. 
Those who experienced similar 
discouragement, 
first 
across 
the nation then on our campus, 
formed a group, eponymously 
named “Speech First.” It sued the 
University in May for violating the 
constitutional right of free speech. 
The 
lawsuit 
claims 
the 
Bias 
Response 
Team 
silences 
viewpoints, 
that 
the 
anti-
harassment 
policies 
are 
“unconstitutionally 
overbroad,” 
and “the effect of these amorphous 
prohibitions … (has a) profound 
chilling 
effect 
on 
protected 
expression.” 
As 
summarized 
by NBC writer Lucas Maiman, 
the regulations deter students 
from voicing their opinions, for 
views deemed as offensive are 
threatened with discipline from 
the Bias Response Team.
“Speech First’s members are 
afraid to voice their views out 
of fear that their speech will 
be reported to the university 
as 
‘harassment,’ 
‘bullying’ 
or 
a ‘bias incident,’” said Speech 
First President Nicole Neily in a 

statement attached to the lawsuit.
“Without the space to debate 
and argue, students won’t ever be 
forced to confront the underlying 
assumptions 
framing 
their 
worldviews,” the lawsuit states, 
quoting a New Republic article. 
The same article also claims groups 
like the Bias Response Team will 
“result in a troubling silence” on 
campuses across the nation.
Now, I believe a school has a 
certain right to protect its students, 
but a line does need to be drawn in 
order to determine the extent to 
which university involvement is 
allowed. The line may be a fine one, 
albeit a crucial one, and one whose 
threshold should be determined by 
U-M students and faculty. The U.S. 
court system outlines free speech 
as the right to use certain “words 
and phrases to convey political 
messages” and to “engage in 
symbolic speech.” As Wolverines 
and Americans, we must find a way 
to feel protected yet not monitored.
This specific event, however, 
reminds me that political discord 
is natural. Actions and reactions. 
Applying 
Newtonian 
physics, 
every 
extremely 
polarized 
statement 
yields 
one 
that 
is 
equally provocative and oppositely 
charged. 
The 
Speech 
First 
members behind this lawsuit, 
the 
ostensibly 
self-professed 
“Students A, B and C,” have their 
opinions on the gender wage gap; 
I, however, have my own, and they 
must recognize on a campus of our 
size, most beliefs are matched with 
their antitheses. I think the wage 
gap between women and men is 
not based on decisions made by the 
former, but rather, based on a long-
standing bias in our world, one that 
started centuries ago. I also believe 
one can and should say what one 
wants in the Diag, and one can 
and should fight for the right to 
do so freely. Students A, B and C 
will do this, and they will demand 
they not get harassed and spat 
upon, shoved and discriminated 
against, “bullied” for their beliefs, 
and I will do the same. I, too, will 
say what I want about abortions 
and immigration, and maybe I’ll 
publish it in The Michigan Daily; 
if I don’t shove you, I expect not 
to be shoved back. Actions and 
reactions.

him, placing him squarely in 
violation of Colorado law and 
simultaneously exempting him 
from any defense contingent on 
the artistic nature of his cakes. 
 
Nor is it relevant that Phillips’ 
defense presented his beliefs 
as complex; providing same-
sex couples with cookies and 
birthday cakes, as opposed to 
wedding cakes, was considered 
by Phillips to be compatible 
with his faith because these 
goods are devoid of association 
with marriage. Much like the 
relationship between Easter 
and 
Christianity, 
or 
Yom 
Kippur and Judaism, same-
sex marriage (especially after 
its nationwide legalization) is 
such a fundamental part of an 
LGBT lifestyle that discerning 
between “same-sex wedding 
cakes” and their heterosexual 
counterparts constitutes, in 
effect, discrimination of same-
sex couples.
In light of the numerous 
merits of the case against 
Phillips, the language used 
in the court’s opinions is 
all 
the 
more 
astonishing. 
Accompanied by commentary 
that, by and large, overlooked 
Phillips’ obligation to subject 
his privately held beliefs to 
the civil rights of others, the 
decision handed down on June 
4 exemplifies the need for 
broad, statutory consideration 
of sexual orientation as a 
protected class. 
Pragmatically, this would 
relieve 
LGBT 
citizens 
from 
relying 
on 
state-
level 
protections 
from 
discrimination in public venues. 
These protections can flounder 
where present, as exemplified 
by the Masterpiece Cakeshop 
case, 
and 
enable 
severe 
injustice where absent, as is the 
case in many states. Federal 
protections, on the other hand, 
would extend to all LGBT 

Americans the assumption of 
equality, affording categorical 
protection that only a select 
few groups currently enjoy. 
Anyone 
doubtful 
of 
the legitimacy, if not the 
consequence, 
of 
these 
protections, 
could 
find 
justification for them in the 
current 
array 
of 
federally 
protected classes. From race 
and national origin to sex 
and disability, these classes 
comprise 
the 
immutable 
aspects of one’s character, 
those elements not up for 
change. Just as one does not 
choose the color of their skin, 
nor should one be forced to 
reconsider 
their 
religion, 
sexual orientation has yet to 
be proven as a matter of choice, 
and a wide body of research 
positively suggests otherwise. 
While the freedom of religion 
undoubtedly remains one of the 
most sacred and justly guarded 
protections enshrined in the 
Constitution, Phillips’ actions 
in the Masterpiece Cakeshop 
case prove unqualified for 
justification on these grounds. 
Notwithstanding the sincerity 
of his beliefs, free expression 
does 
not 
supplant 
the 
state’s obligation to combat 
the 
disruption 
caused 
by 
discrimination, as the court 
has observed multiple times 
prior and as was even cited by 
Justice Kennedy. Recognizing 
sexual 
orientation 
as 
a 
protected class acknowledges 
the principles undergirding 
existing federal protections, 
while ensuring LGBT citizens 
are not again subjected to the 
privately held, albeit genuine, 
religious beliefs of others with 
whom they share the public 
space.

Jazz can be a little confusing. 
Since its roots in the early 1920s, 
listeners’s definitions of jazz have 
since changed drastically. Known as 
one of the only true original Ameri-
can artforms, its ever expanding 
characteristics 
and 
development 
of subgenres are truly daunting. 
This might contribute to why many 
older generations believe the genre 
is on the way out. However, millen-
nial favorite Sebastian from “La La 
Land” might have been overreact-
ing a bit when he said that jazz is 
dying. Kamasi Washington’s newest 
album, Heaven and Earth, is a pris-
tine example of how jazz is thriving.
The album itself is huge: Span-
ning just over two and a half hours, a 
full listen is certainly a commitment. 
However, even after my first full lis-
ten, I never found myself dozing off. 
Although there are a few tracks that 
don’t hit as hard as others, they all 
hold their own unique characteris-
tics.
There are three sections to the 
album. The first section, “Earth,” 
represents “the world as I see it 
outwardly, the world that I am part 
of,” Washington explained prior to 
the release of the album. The sec-
ond half, “Heaven,” represents “the 
world as I see it inwardly. Who I am 
and the choices I make.” However, a 
week after the release of the album, 
Washington released an EP titled 
The Choice, with a similar cover to 
Between Heaven and Earth. Appar-
ently, this release was included with 
physical copies of the album, but was 
recently released digitally. It fits well 
in the overall context of the album, 
but brings about new musical con-
cepts (as well as a Carol King and a 
Five Stairsteps cover).
The tracks are at once dense and 
transparent. Heaven and Earth is so 
different, much like Washington’s 
previous full-length album, The Epic, 

from any other jazz album I’ve ever 
heard, and this is largely thanks to 
the wide range of tonalities achieved 
through varying instrumentation.
From the very get-go, a full 
orchestra and choir accompany a 
full rhythm section to create an 
overwhelming sheet of sound that 
is harmonically rich and full within 
the first 30 seconds of the opening 
track, “Fists of Fury.”
Without getting into the ongoing 
debate over what constitutes as jazz, 
I will say that this album does take 
a lot of notes from jazz albums of a 
varying character. Not only does he 
directly reference the likes of Fred-
die Hubbard or Ron Porter (who’s 
also featured on the album), but 
in his compositions and solos, it’s 
easy to see how artists like Wayne 
Shorter, Thundercat, Chris Potter 
and even Max Roach influenced his 
work.
This choir and orchestra are so 
unique and characteristic of Wash-
ington’s music, but even when 

they’re not used, tracks like “Hub-
Tones” and “The Invincible Youth” 
feel full by taking on different styles 
and bringing other instrument 
groups to shine. On “The Invin-
cible Youth,” for example, Cameron 
Graves and Thundercat’s playing 
truly shines and fills a space that 
feels appropriate and rich.
The “Heaven” section of the 
album was where this album really 
differed from some for Kamasi’s 
previous work. Tracks like “The 
Space Travelers Lullaby” and “Song 
for the Fallen” truly went in direc-
tions I was not anticipating, and they 
fit the inward direction Washing-
ton strived for. “Show Us the Way” 

is an interesting callback to The 
Epic’s opening track, “Change of the 
Guard,” and the closing track, “Will 
You Sing,” is a fantastic closer that 
sums up the album’s themes nicely.
However, sometimes these grand 
instrumentations presented in the 
album feel undeserved. These epic 
moments seem to pop up in every 
other track, and they seem to con-
sume the track. Don’t get me wrong, 
the choir and orchestra sound abso-
lutely breathtaking, but because 
they hit hard right in the beginning, 
middle and end, the album reaches 
several climaxes without subjecting 
the listener to any other experience.
Along with this, Washington’s 
solos sometimes feel similarly struc-
tured. They’re technically and artis-
tically amazing. As a saxophonist 
myself, I’m blown away by his sound 
and technique. However, they often 
take the same direction throughout 
songs and utilize the same extended 
techniques every time. They’re mind 
blowing solos, but it feels like my 
mind is being blown in the same way 
every song.
These complaints may seem real-
ly petty, and that’s because they are. 
This album as a whole feels like a 
complete sonic stroke of genius. The 
fact that Washington can yet again 
create an album lasting over two and 
a half hours while keeping the mate-
rial fresh and consistent is certainly 
an accomplishment.
While many see Washington’s 
music as the resurgence of jazz 
in American popular culture, I 
wouldn’t quite say that myself. Jazz 
has been growing and advancing 
since its conception and continues 
to do so today, even before Kamasi 
rushed onto the scene. However, 
because of Washington’s forward 
thinking and collaboration through-
out generes, Heaven and Earth is an 
album that sets new standards for 
modern jazz musicians (and every 
other musician, for that matter) for 
years to come.

François 
Truffaut’s 
1962 
romance 
“Jules 
and 
Jim” 
chronicles the development of 
a tragic love triangle between 
three European writers through 
the first half of the 20 century. 
Best friends, the German Jules 
(Oskar Werner, “Fahrenheit 451”) 
and the French Jim (Henri Serre, 
“The Fire Within”), each stumble 
helplessly in love with the beautiful 
Catherine (Jeanne Moreau, “The 
Lovers”) and all her dangerous 
eccentricities. Told in three acts 
that each take place years apart, 
Truffaut uses benchmarks like 
the first World War and Jim’s 
disappearing French mustache to 
indicate that time has passed.
Telling the story spread out over 
time is a step away from the fast-
paced, almost real-time standard 
of the New Wave, becoming 
reminiscent — ironically, due to the 
whole pretense of the movement 
— of a book. Instead of explaining 
the thoughts and desires of its 
characters through the limited 
scope of one or two insulated 
incidents, “Jules and Jim” shades 
toward showing the development 
of the characters over the course 
of their lives, more like “Les 
Misérables” 
than 
“Breathless.” 
And the presence of history even 
gives the film the same feeling 
of weight as something like “Les 
Mis,” turning it into a story about 
much more than just love turned 
sour. “Jules and Jim” has the 
atmosphere of a big film.
Despite all the great set-up, 
the love triangle that drives the 
narrative doesn’t satisfy. Jules and 
Catherine marry initially, but she 
doesn’t stay loyal to him for very 
long. By the time he has returned 
from the war, they have their first 
child and she has turned cold. 
Catherine’s infidelities are declared 
with the same lack of gusto with 
which someone might announce 
they have buttered a piece of toast. 
It’s hard to do justice to how passé 

the characters respond. It really 
just feels like Jules and Jim don’t 
care that the woman they are so 
dedicated to doesn’t seem to give a 
damn about them.
The frustrating part is how 
near-perfectly the love triangle is 
laid out. When Catherine begins 
to slide out of love with Jules, there 
should be tension. Instead, Jules 
resigns himself to living across 
the hall with his entomology 
work, asking Jim to love her so 
he can continue to see her in his 
life. But I have to stress: There’s 
an absence of emotion in any of 
these interactions. Jules has no 
resentment for either his best 
friend or his wife, who his best 
friend is trying to conceive a child 
with. It’s an absolute whiff.
And even as Catherine continues 
her 
adulterous 
tour-de-France 
outside of the two friends, neither 
rise to question her, as though 
they’re so captivated, so in love, 
that they can’t say a word. I don’t 
buy it. The film lacks the passion it 
needs to pull off the circumstances 
it sets up.
It’s not all loss. “Jules and 
Jim,” though unable to resonate 
emotionally 
with 
me, 
is 
unquestionably a beautiful film. 
Truffaut seemed to have developed 
as a photographer in the two 
years since his debut feature “400 
Blows,” his eye for composition 
almost unmatched here. And if 
not 
quintessential 
New 
Wave 
in its narrative approach, “Jules 
and Jim” can sit comfortably as a 
revolutionary picture by its drive to 
experiment. At times shrinking to a 
pinhole or expanding from a point, 
Truffaut’s frame takes the viewers’ 
eyes on a carefully manicured 
tour of European countrysides 
and tempered city vistas. The 
director even goes so far as to 
halt the picture altogether with a 
few momentary freeze-frames on 
Catherine’s face, as though burning 
her image into the film-reel as it is

Harry Styles is staring at me, 
and his eyes are bright green, 
wide open and beautiful. He’s 
kneeling down to come closer and 
his gaze is a straight shot directly 
down the center of the camera 
lens, piercing right through the 
screen to meet mine. “I’ve got a 
fire for a heart,” he says in a low 
clear voice, as if the nearly 800 
million people watching didn’t 
already know.
Harry’s stare, and my subse-
quent heart-pounding magnetic 
reaction to it, is no coincidence. 
The fact that I feel as though he’s 
looking at me and me alone isn’t 
a mistake, because he doesn’t just 
happen to be a pretty boy look-
ing into a camera, and I don’t just 
happen to be unable to look away. 
A lot of people are born with 
good faces, but heartthrobs aren’t 
made by accident.
Even though every aspect of a 
boy band performance is deliber-
ately, artfully calibrated to maxi-
mize irresistibility, heartthrobs 
do their best to make it all seem 
effortless with those floppy mops 
of hair they all seem to have, 
falling into their eyes whenever 
they hunch over the mic stand. 
It’s tantalizingly messy, makes 
you want to run a hand through 
it — and that’s exactly the point. 
Shirts are always unbuttoned just 
one too many, in a quiet master-
class of revealing just enough to 
make you want more. In videos 
if they’re not looking dead on at 
the camera they’re usually back-
lit, with the roving lights crossing 
shadows over their faces, lighting 
the backs of their shoulders, the 

slopes of their necks, the tips of 
their curls. The cuts in their vid-
eos are quick, images rushing one 
after the other like a memory — a 
flash of a smile, a hit of the drum, 
a couple strides across the stage. 
It makes the viewer feel like 
you’re always chasing after them, 
always trying to get a better look.
It’s both mesmerizing and 
menacing, because the promise 
of a heartthrob is not unlike the 
promise of a pick-up artist. They 
look you in the eye and they swear 
that you light up their world like 
nobody else, that they hold a want 
that’s all-consuming and all for 
you. Then they smile, flip their 
hair out of their eyes and move on 
to the next girl at the show. The 
heartthrobs of the world chose 
their audience of young girls 
carefully, harnessing the power 
of teenage obsession by giving it 
a focus and tangible shape in the 
form of a boy with a guitar. 
If you ask me, there’s not much 
separating a boy band and a rock 
star, not in performance style, 
looks or audience demographics 
— the only discernible difference 
is the genre of music and the cred-
ibility that follows when the criti-
cal world assigns rock musicians 
a heavyweight status they don’t 
offer to boy bands. An ineffable 
rock star swagger unites the two, 
a type of posturing that can’t be 
taught, but can be harnessed with 
laser precision on the audience to 
incite a violent fervor of teenage 
lust.
There’s a classic performance 
of Zeppelin doing “Stairway” at 
Madison Square Garden that puts 
the swagger on display. Robert 
Plant makes even the act of stand-
ing up seem lazy, his body propped 

up at an angle, barechested in just 
a vest and all that curly hair. You 
pay close attention to his every 
move: The way his hand curls 
around the microphone, every 
pulse of his hips, every arc of his 
neck when he lets his hair fly back. 
Jimmy Page is close by. You can 
barely see his face. He’s slumped 
over his guitar. He’s wearing a 
dark jewel-encrusted jacket open 
with nothing under, and he’s cov-
ered in blue light — hair, skin and 
fretboards all glinting. They drip 
an almost alien sexuality, making 
an otherworldly spectacle of their 
very bodies on the stage. A care-
ful push-pull of parts obscured 
and parts revealed. A shirt flaps 
open but the face is covered in 
the dark. A guitar gleams bright 
for only a second before the light 
roves somewhere else.
You can’t tear your eyes away 
by design, because sex and lust 
were always the pulse that drove 
the charisma of classic rock stars.
The fantasy of the heartthrob 
has remained remarkably consis-
tent over the years, because by 
and large, teenage girls haven’t 
changed. If you went to a Stones 
concert in ’64, a Zeppelin concert 
in ’74 or a One Direction con-
cert in 2014, the audience would 
be pretty much the same. Still a 
deafening roar of screams, still 
throwing their bras onstage, still 
reaching their hands in the air, to 
dance, yes, but mostly to grab hold 
of the boys onstage, because they 
feel (just as they’ve always felt) 
the pulse underneath the upbeat 
pop songs, the pulse of sexuality 
that’s being sold.
It’s no accident that boy bands 
like One Direction and 5 Sec-
onds of Summer are marketed to 

teenyboppers, just barely on the 
cusp of discovering their sexual-
ity, suddenly presented with a few 
perfect specimens onto which 
they can safely project all of their 
dreams and desires. Harry Styles 
would never spread rumors about 
you the way the boys at school do. 
All Harry Styles wants to do is 
look you in the eye, tuck a stray 
hair behind your ear and sing 
just for you about how beautiful 
you are. It’s a fantasy, a push-
pull of what to reveal and what to 
obscure, all in the process of mak-
ing real what had only ever been 
a figment of the imagination of 
teenagers everywhere.
In 5 Seconds of Summer’s single 
“Youngblood,” lead singer Luke 
Hemmings sings, “You push and 
you push and I’m pulling away / 
pulling away from you.” Here he’s 
tapping into the heart of the boy 
band’s promise, the promise of 
the oh-so-charming pick-up art-
ist. “Youngblood / say you want 
me, say you want me,” he sings, 
almost taunting his audience, who 
wants him to want them as badly 
as they do him, knowing full well 
it’s the only desire that he could 
never ever satisfy. To them, he’s 
pushing and pulling away, but 
they want to be the girl he’s sing-
ing to, the one he wants so bad it 
hurts. But he’s not singing to them 
and he never will — he’s singing 
to their hunger, the indescribable 
desire screaming out of control 
that all teenage girls carry with 
them.
It’s funny, because boy bands 
are almost universally dismissed 
as light and disposable, but there’s 
nothing delicate or gentle or any 
of the other attributes we call stu-
pid and code feminine about the 
hunger that propels them. There 
is a fundamental violence in a 
horde of girls chasing these boys 
through a mall like they want to 
eat them alive. Or in a stadium full 
of people chanting the name of a 
boy until their throats are hoarse, 
like a teen girl funhouse mirrored 
two minute hate. They form a 
mob, screaming and starving, an 
obsession that’s both completely 
insane and completely innocu-
ous. Innocuous because it’s a well 
regarded fact, universally under-
stood that this is just what teen-
age girls do. They bare their teeth 
with tears running down their 
faces and young blood pulsing 
through their outstretched hands 
reaching for the stage, curling 
into fists and punching the air, 
clawing and screaming, making 
presents of their very bodies — 
making any excuse to get closer.

The modern boy band or, 
the anatomy of a hearthrob

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

SINGLE REVIEW: 
“CRUSH”

A lot of pop music today wants 
to set the mood for a hot and 
heavy night — choose any song 
on the soundtrack for “50 Shades 
of Grey” — but Cigarettes After 
Sex offers something for the 
after. As the name of the band 
suggests, their slow and ambient 
music extends the blissful few 
moments when the real problems 
of the world haven’t yet returned 
and the entire universe feels like 
only two people.
Their 2012 EP, I., promised 
sexy, meditative music for the 
future. “Dreaming of You” had 
simple 
reverb 
synth 
chords 
mixed with bold hi-hats and 
cymbals. The subtle lyrics left 
room to fill in the blanks: “You’re 
the one calling out / you’re the 
one that’s calling me to heaven.”
After a 5 year hiatus, Cigarettes 
After Sex returned last year 
with a debut self-titled album 
that hinted at the catastrophe 
to come and deterioration of the 
band’s signature allure. Most of 
the songs on their 2017 album 
retained what made the EP so 
sensual and such easy listening. 
But the last track, the explicit-
rated 
“Young 
and 
Dumb,” 
marked a misunderstanding of 
the band’s best qualities.
The lyrics on the track try 
hard to evoke lust, but end up 
too straightforward and very 
cringe-worthy as lead vocalist, 
Greg Gonzalez, sings, “You are 
a patron saint of sucking cock.” 
Dear God, why would you write 
that?
The 
newest 
single 
from 
Cigarettes After Sex, “Crush,” 
unfortunately 
follows 
the 
example of “Young and Dumb.”
“Crush” begins with potential 
as Gonzalez uses his restrained 
and high voice — a whisper on 
the verge of a scream — to the 
band’s advantage in combination 
with pure, but suggestive, lyrics 
like, “photographs you sent / of 
you lying in your swimsuit on 
the bed.” Then the chorus begins 
and destroys the seductive vibe 
established in the opening verse 
when Gonzales sings repeatedly, 
“I wanna fuck your love slow.”
“Crush” 
proves 
Cigarettes 
After Sex has un-learned the 
lesson they taught the music 
world in their initial EP: Sexiness 
is not found in explicitness.

The problem with supporting Kanye West

 Coming back home 
for the summer after 
being away at college 
is quite an interesting 
experience. You realize 
not much has changed 
and almost everything 
is the way you left it, 
yet inside, you feel like 
you have transformed 
so greatly within such 
a short time that you 
sort of stick out like a 
sore thumb among the 
rest of your peers. It 
takes a while to adjust 
back into the usual 
swing of things.
At first, coming back 
home for the summer 
felt great. I missed 
my family, I missed 
my friends, I missed 
being able to drive 
and knowing my city 
like the back of my 
hand. 
I 
especially 
missed the food and 
not having to depend 
on the halal section 
of the South Quad 
dining hall to fulfill my 
daily protein intake. 
However, being away 
from home for so long 
and being immersed in 
a more open-minded, 
diverse and positive 
environment 
made 
me forget some of the 
most pressing issues 
I resented about my 
hometown 
in 
the 
first 
place. 
Among 
these 
issues 
are 
rampant homophobia, 
relentless 
gossiping 
and judgment, racism 
and 
anti-Blackness, 
slut-shaming and so 
much more. Though 
only 
a 
45-minute 
drive, 
my 
college 
campus feels like a 
world away from my 
predominantly 
Arab-
Muslim hometown of 
Dearborn.
 I had forgotten the 
daily 
Twitter 
wars 
that take place when 
people begin bashing 
each other or putting 
others 
down 
for 
making choices that do 

not coincide with their 
own religious beliefs. 
I had forgotten how 
some words on a screen 
could make me feel so 
unsettled and angry 
as I witness my LGBT 
friends being attacked 
online by people who 
once smiled to their 
face in high school. 
I had forgotten that 
blood-boiling 
feeling 
when 
a 
friend 
or 
coworker makes a tone-
deaf remark and you 
have to decide quickly 
whether to listen to 
the urge in your heart 
telling you to call them 
out or the knot in your 
throat telling you to let 
it slide. I had forgotten 
saying something is not 
always as easy as you 
think. The suffocating 
feeling 
of 
knowing 
something is wrong but 
not knowing what to do 
about it still resurfaces, 
though I try my best to 
keep it at bay and not 
engage in negativity.
 I am not trying to 
bash my hometown. 
I love it with all my 
heart; it is a part of me 
and a huge chunk of 
my identity. My family 
is wonderful and my 
friends are amazing; I 
had a good education 
and the city can really 
come 
together 
and 
support 
each 
other 
when 
it 
needs 
to. 
However, 
it 
would 
be 
incognizant 
to 
pretend issues do not 
exist that have been 
fostered by generations 
of 
ignorance 
and 
bathed 
in 
hatred. 
Mental health issues 
are 
ridiculed, 
gay 
people are ostracized, 
girls are bullied and 
“exposed” and people 
are hurt, day in and 
day out. I often hear 
my hometown referred 
to as a “bubble,” where 
many 
people 
get 
trapped, refusing to 
challenge their belief 
systems 
and 
think 
outside the norms with 

which they have grown 
up. On one hand, I 
understand this is not 
entirely the fault of a 
community that was 
compelled 
to 
move 
into a small city of 
people of their similar 
background out of fear 
of hatred by settling 
elsewhere. 
Many 
people 
in 
this 
city 
come from families of 
immigrants, 
people 
who 
have 
known 
pain and racism and 
economic 
inequality 
all their lives. This 
is all they know; this 
is 
generations 
of 
ideals passed down. 
However, I do believe 
it 
is 
the 
personal 
responsibility of each 
individual 
to 
learn 
about others, expand 
their 
horizons 
and 
confront their flawed 
behaviors. There is no 
excuse for remaining 
ignorant. That is a 
choice.
 Growing up in this 
city, it took me a while 
to 
recognize 
myself 
as part of the problem 
and unlearn so much 
of the negativity that 
was 
spewed 
around 
me constantly. I, as 
did many others, took 
it upon myself to learn 
from 
marginalized 
groups and empathize 
with 
struggles 
and 
causes outside of my 
own. As I strive to 
constantly be learning 
and growing, I try to 
challenge the harmful 
notions 
around 
me 
while still holding true 
to my faith. I strive 
to call out injustice 
where I see it in hopes 
that we as a collective 
may take small steps 
toward a kinder and 
more 
understanding 
community. 
My 
community is often the 
target of hate, but we 
cannot expect people 
to come together for 
us if we cannot come 
together for them, or 
even for ourselves.

 
On 
February 
2016, 
musical artist Kanye West 
tweeted out “BILL COSBY 
INNOCENT !!!!!!!!!!” but 
I’m sure this escaped your 
memory, didn’t it?
There is plenty to say about 
Kanye West, but there are 
plenty of memories that 
appear to be missing in 
the minds of our young 
social activists. After West 
showed his support for 
President Donald Trump 
and claimed slavery was 
a “choice,” many people 
rushed 
to 
defend 
the 
21-time Grammy Award 
winner. The few memories 
that seem too conscious 
within the public mind are 
West is a “musical genius” 
who is suffering from 
“mental illness” and still 
“grieving the loss of his 
mother,” though one has to 
wonder if this a way for fans 
to validate his behavior. 
Even celebrities rushed to 
support West, like Chance 
the Rapper who tweeted, 
“Black people don’t have to 
be democrats.” It’s pretty 
clear though West’s actions 
continuously 
prove 
his 
incompetence, people will 
still defend him no matter 
what he does because they 
fell in love with the “old 
Kanye.”
Minority 
communities 
have worked to try and 
support West, and this 
makes sense because of 
his cultural significance. 
In 2004, West released the 
album “College Dropout”, 
which won a Grammy 
award for Best Rap Album. 
After his debut album, 
West 
collaborated 
with 
artists such as Jay-Z, Lupe 
Fiasco and John Legend 
resulting in multiple songs 
reaching No. 1 on iTunes. 
In addition, West’s fearless 
nature has never been 
hidden from the public. For 
example, after the Category 
5 storm Hurricane Katrina 
demolished New Orleans 
in 2005, West did not back 
away from calling former 
President George W. Bush 

someone 
who 
“doesn’t 
care about Black people.” 
This was a time when 
the 
African-American 
community 
appreciated 
West’s vocalness on issues 
that affected their lives. 
Even West’s rap lyrics 
have 
always 
provided 
deep insight into different 
societal struggles while still 
maintaining a very high 
energy.
However, to support West 
because he is the victim of 
his circumstances would 
be nothing but a twisted 
fantasy. As West released 
his newest solo album “Ye” 
as well as a collaboration 
with musical artist Kid 
Cudi 
titled 
“Kids 
See 
Ghosts,” I was both shocked 
and disappointed to see 
how many of my friends 
have continued to support 
him. The issue with West is 
not that he is a Republican 
or even that he supports 
Trump, the problem is 
West continues to present 
himself as a minority who 
uses his own voice to abuse 
other minority populations. 
West’s 
tweet 
declaring 
Cosby’s innocence clearly 
shows his inability to see 
the sheer significance of 
sexual assault. His blatant 
disrespect 
for 
women 
portrayed in this tweet 
shows he has continued to 
go unscathed while equally 
working to silence voices. 
Meanwhile, his claim that 
slavery was a choice is so 
disrespectful to centuries 
of struggle; it doesn’t just 
negate the struggles of 
African-American 
slaves, 
but also the people from 
all 
around 
who 
were 
pillaged and colonized by 
communities in power.
And minorities all over 
the world gave him a No. 1 
album.
Isn’t that just hypocritical? 
After Trump’s election, I 
saw a lot of tweets about 
how those who voted for 
him decided racism was not 
a final straw. Do we hold 
any standards for those we 
support with our money? In 
these moments, I’ve come to 
realize even those who have 
felt the quick prick of racist 

comments are all right 
with having blood flow if 
the beat is good enough 
or if the rap verse slams. 
Though West’s comments 
are bad, it is much more 
than that — this is the type 
of grotesque behavior that 
leaves a particularly nasty 
taste in your mouth, not 
because of the flavor but, 
rather, how long it lasts. 
West’s comments are the 
reason why people feel 
marginalized 
because 
people actually look up 
to him. If you see your 
coworker 
listening 
to 
 
Kanye West’s album or 
it happens to play on the 
radio, you are reminded 
some people in the world 
don’t acknowledge your 
struggles as valid. For 
me and for so many 
other 
people, 
hearing 
the comments made by 
those people is a constant 
reminder that the factual 
evidence of abuse against 
minorities will never be 
enough to be acknowledged 
by millions of Americans.
West may be a “musical 
genius” or “mentally ill” 
or grieving for his mother, 
but he has also experienced 
the same racial prejudice 
that we all have, only 
he chose to silence the 
voices of his own race 
once he gained additional 
socioeconomic benefits in 
order to promote his music. 
And we supported him 
for doing that. For those 
who bought his album, 
who posted it on their 
Instagram story, do you 
have any right to be angry 
with those who use hate 
to fuel their social status? 
So next time I see another 
minority 
tweet 
about 
conservative commentator 
Tomi Lahren or wishing to 
stand up for the immigrant 
children separated from 
their parents, I have to 
wonder, did their pockets 
ever support a different 
narrative? West is a not a 
victim and the words you 
sing along to hold more 
oppressive 
blood 
than 
your hashtags can try to 
counterbalance.
And don’t you forget that.

 Ignorance isn’t the right choice

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
SPORTS

On Friday, there was an 
airplane hovering somewhere 
over the Midwest. This is not a 
shocking revelation, but what 
was in that plane makes the 
story intriguing.
Sitting 
inside 
was 
285-
pound wrestler Adam Coon, a 
recently-minted Michigan alum 
who had just qualified for the 
Senior World Wrestling Team 
— a glorious position paired 
with elite company.
For any other wrestler that 
weekend, it could be assumed 
that they would’ve been flying 
back home to celebrate or rest 
after their showing at the World 
Team Trials in Tulsa, Okla. But 
Coon is not any other wrestler.
After 
downing 
long-time 
opponent Robby Smith in the 
Greco-Roman 
World 
Team 
Trials, 
Coon 
couldn’t 
let 
himself celebrate. He had to fly 
to Bethlehem, Penn. to compete 
in the Freestyle World Team 
Trials. Attempting to qualify 
for both squads, Coon had to 
consistently remain in attack 
mode in order to see his goals 

realized.
Coon would then go on to drop 
the two matches — essential for 
making the team — to another 
former opponent, world bronze 
medalist Nick Gwiazdowski, in 
the Final X event at Lehigh.
It was a weekend to remember 
for the heavyweight with highs 
and lows, and, as he described 
it, the longest sleep of his entire 
life.
Coon’s 
two 
showdowns 
arose 
under 
very 
similar 
circumstances, but would end 
with two drastically different 
outcomes.
To kick things off, Coon began 
his World Team qualification 
campaign against a man he had 
just lost to in the U.S. Open, a 
tournament prior to the World 
Team Trials — four-time Greco 
World Team member and 2016 
Olympian Robby Smith.
In the U.S. Open, Smith was 
able to set the tone early and 
cruise to a 5-0 victory over the 
Michigan man. But since being 
named an NCAA All-American 
automatically qualified Coon 
for the World Team Trials, a 
rematch seemed inevitable.
Closing the gap set during 

the Open, Coon looked like a 
new man on the mat and out-
muscled Smith for a 3-1 first 
round win in a best-of-three 
series. Looking to put things 
away and earn his spot on the 
World Team, Coon entered into 
an impeccably close second 
match. Narrowly trailing late 
into the bout, Coon laid it all 
on the line and slammed the big 
man down for a last-second pin 
to put Smith away for good.
“It was a little different 
strategy 
that 
goes 
into 
wrestling with him,” Coon said. 
“I made some small adjustments 
in strategy, and it worked on 
a bunch of small positioning 
things that took a lot of work. 
And it was just that small 
change that ended up leading 
to a pin. I mean he’s a fierce 
competitor, so it was great to be 
able to take a couple away from 
him, but I know he’s gonna be 
able to come back very strong, 
so I have to make sure I’m ready 
to go when he comes back.”
Coon 
also 
found 
success 
in his ability to pummel with 
Smith and hold his position, 
which ultimately led to the 
victory. Being able to set your 

position against a guy with 
the command and upper-body 
strength of Smith is no easy 
feat. In fact, it had seemed 
almost impossible for Coon 
until the Finals.
Coon couldn’t revel in his 
achievement, though, as he had 
a plane to catch.
During his travels, Coon 
had to completely switch gears 
while 
attempting 
to 
avoid 
fatigue. Switching from Greco 
to Freestyle is a tall order as 
leg attacks are forbidden in 
Greco. Adding on an entire 
half of the body as a target can 
certainly throw a wrench in any 
wrestler’s approach.
“Once Greco was done, it 
was just a quick transition, (I) 
didn’t really have much time 
to celebrate,” Coon said. “Just 
get to the airport and start 
thinking about Freestyle, just 
getting my mind ready for the 
leg attacks because in Greco, 
obviously, you don’t have the 
leg attacks. So, it’s just thinking 
about a different style as we’re 
travelling through and just 
change your mind and recover.”
In 
Bethlehem, 
another 
familiar opponent was waiting 

for him. This time it was 
two-time 
NCAA 
Champion 
Gwiazdowski, 
commonly 
referred to as, “Gwiz.”
The Final X was not the first 
time Coon saw Gwiz on the 
other side of the mat. The two 
squared off most notably in the 
2015 
NCAA 
Championships 
where Coon fell 7-6 to the then-
reigning champ. With a notion 
of how to best defeat Gwiz, 
Coon gave the best-of-three 
series everything he had before 
falling in straight matches 6-1 
and 6-1, respectively.
It was here that Coon’s plan 
— to become the first man to 
qualify for both the Greco and 
Freestyle World Teams since 
1981 — came to an end.
“He did a really good job 
defending my stuff,” Coon said. 
“I, on the other hand, let him get 
to his attacks too much. I didn’t 
do a really good job executing 
the plan we had in place while 
he did, so that just gave him the 
results that happened.”
There’s no doubt that fatigue 
was another huge factor that 
played into this showdown. 
With hardly any recovery time, 
the mountain just seemed a bit 
too steep for Coon. But never 
the one to make excuses, the 
Michigan alum gives all credit 
to his opponent.
“Exhaustion might’ve played 
a factor, but at the same time, 
I’m not gonna make excuses,” 
Coon said. “He was better than 
me that day, and obviously, if we 
wrestle another day, I’d like to 
go after him again, but on that 
day he was the better wrestler, 
so he’s the World Team guy for 
sure.”
Coon can’t be that upset, 
though, as he did make one 
World Team. From here, Coon 
will train in anticipation of 
the World Championships in 
Budapest, Hungary in October 
of this year.
“It’s been a few years since 
I’ve been on one of these 
world teams, so I haven’t been 
wrestling 
[wrestlers 
from 
other countries] for a long 
time,” Coon said, “So I’m really 
looking forward to testing my 
skills against the best in the 
world just to see where I fit in 
on that pecking order.”
Being able to focus on one 
style will be good for the 
heavyweight, and with any 
luck, the plane to Budapest will 
be the only one Coon will have 
to take in his time competing 
for a championship.

The Michigan field hockey team looks to continue its success from a year ago where it advanced to the Final Four 
Season Preview: ‘M’ Field Hockey

When 
then-junior 
forward 
Emma 
Way 
tipped 
a 
pass 
between the legs of Northwestern 
goalkeeper Annie Kalfa on Nov. 12 
— completing a hat trick — it all but 
sealed the Wolverines’ 18th win in 
a row. Minutes later, it was official: 
for the first time since 2003, the 
Michigan field hockey team was 
going to the Final Four.
And though the Wolverines 
met their demise in the NCAA 
semifinals 
against 
Maryland, 
the Final Four run capped off 
Michigan’s best season in years 
— a season few saw coming at 
the beginning of it. After years of 
relative mediocrity, the Wolverines 
put everyone on watch.
This year, after losing two key 
pieces to a defense that last season 
served up 16 shutouts and finished 
second in the country in goals-
against average, Michigan will 
have to retool its identity if it wants 
to build on last season’s result. 
But with a wealth of young talent 
and the continued development of 
returning players, the Wolverines 
have the pieces to contend again.
Gone are midfielder and back 
Katie Trombetta — the 2017 Big Ten 
Player of the Year — and goalkeeper 
Sam Swenson, named the 2017 Big 
Ten Defensive Player of the Year. 
Instead, sophomore Halle O’Neill 
and senior Maggie Bettez will 
anchor the Wolverines’ defense.
As a true freshman, O’Neill 

didn’t expect to start right away, 
but it soon became clear that her 
presence bolstered the back line. 
Her performance was good enough 
to earn her a spot on the U21 
National Team. Bettez, meanwhile, 
also 
turned 
heads 
with 
her 
aggressiveness in the backfield— 
and 
while 
their 
contributions 
were 
relatively 
unsung, 
their 
development could provide the 
foundation 
for 
another 
elite 
defensive unit. With sophomore 
goalkeeper Sidonie LaPlante — who 
has just three career appearances 
— facing the daunting task of 
replacing Swenson, a strong back 
line could go a long way.
The offense, meanwhile, returns 
its most prolific goal-scorers in 
senior Emma Way and junior 
Meg Dowthwaite. The tandem 
led Michigan in the postseason 
— Dowthwaite’s overtime goal 
in the NCAA Round of 16 against 
Syracuse broke a scoreless tie, and 
Way’s hat trick provided all the 
offense the Wolverines needed 
in their quarterfinal against the 
Wildcats. Dowthwaite was an All-
Big Ten First Team selection last 
season.
And while the midfielders are 
Michigan’s 
least-experienced 
group, they have the potential to 
develop into one of the conference’s 
top 
units. 
Junior 
Guadalupe 
Fernandez Lacort — who co-led the 
team in assists last season — and 
sophomore Kayla Reed return as 
starters, and with 10 midfielders 
on 
the 
roster, 
coach 
Marcia 

Pankratz will have a lot of depth to 
experiment with.
Among those midfielders are 
two notable incoming freshmen 
in Kathryn Peterson and Sofi
 
Southam. Peterson, ranked the No. 
8 recruit in the nation, is a versatile 
passer who is strong offensively 
and defensively. Southam — like 
Fernandez Lacort a product of 
Argentina — was selected for the 
elite USA Field Hockey U21 Junior 
National Camp.
The 
Wolverines 
once 
again 
face a tough schedule that will 
give them the opportunity to test 
themselves against the top teams 
in the country. Among the slate is 
a rematch with the Terrapins — a 
perennial Big Ten powerhouse — as 
well as games against Connecticut 
and North Carolina, the other 
Final Four teams. Michigan upset 
the Tar Heels last year, but the 
Huskies — the eventual national 
champions — served up one of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
three 
losses. 
Michigan’s schedule also features 
four other tournament teams in 
Wake Forest, Northwestern, Penn 
State and Stanford, all four of which 
it defeated in 2017.
Though the Wolverines lost 
several top players, last year’s Final 
Four squad also featured several 
standout 
underclassmen 
who 
will now have the chance to step 
up and lead the team. If they can 
build on last season and take their 
games to the next level, Michigan’s 
graduation losses might soon be 
forgotten.

‘M’ hires new assistant 
coach Yvonne Sanchez

On Monday, the Michigan 
women’s basketball opted to 
go with a veteran of the game 
with the team’s hiring of its 
latest assistant coach, Yvonne 
Sanchez.
Sanchez has been coaching 
for 
23 
years, 
whether 
in 
an assistant or head coach 
position. 
Starting 
her 
coaching career in her native 
state of New Mexico, she 
served for six years as an 
assistant coach at New Mexico 
State before working at San 
Diego State for a 
brief stint before 
transitioning to 
the University of 
New Mexico.
In 
Alberquerque, 
she 
was 
an 
assistant 
for 
eleven 
years 
before 
being 
promoted 
to 
head 
coach 
in 
2011, where she 
led the Lobos to a Women’s 
Basketball Invitational berth 
twice before leaving in 2016.
After a year’s absence from 
coaching, she returns to the 
profession but this time as the 
Wolverines’ assistant coach — 
specializing in coaching the 
guards. After the departure 
of 
first-team 
All 
Big 
Ten 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty, 
development in the position 
would help mend the hole left 
by Michigan’s all-time leading 
scorer.
What 
Sanchez 
brings 
is 
something Michigan has had 
trouble with over the past 
couple seasons — experience 
in creating stability for late-
season finishes.
“When filling this assistant 
coaching position, I thought 
it was really important to 
bring in someone with a lot 
of experience — whether that 
was as a head coach or an 
assistant coach,” said Kim 
Barnes Arico to MGoBlue. 
“Yvonne brings a ton of both 
with her to Michigan. She is 
well-respected amongst her 
peers as well as recruits. I 

think she has an outstanding 
personality 
and 
connects 
well with people all over the 
country.”
The 
Wolverines 
saw 
a 
successful 
season 
with 
a 
return 
to 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
since 
the 
2012-13 
season. 
However, 
their 
berth 
was 
threatened by a lackadaisical 
finish, where they lost four of 
their last six regular season 
games. With Sanchez, they 
look to fix that and improve 
in the development of guards. 
With a recruiting class that 
has two point guards in the top 
100 — including 
five-star recruit 
Amy 
Dilk 
— 
development of 
the 
first-years 
will be essential 
for success.
“She 
will 
bring 
another 
dimension in all 
aspects of our 
program, 
from 
recruiting 
to 
working 
with 
our 
point 
guards,” 
Barnes 
Arico told MGoBlue. “I had 
an opportunity to work with 
her about 15 years ago on 
the All-American committee 
and have followed her career 
ever since. They had a ton of 
success at New Mexico during 
her time there, reaching a 
Sweet 16, growing such a large 
fan base, and recruiting some 
great players. We are excited 
to have her join us in Ann 
Arbor.”
With the hiring of Sanchez, 
the 
program 
has 
taken 
a 
step forward to stability and 
consistency that should push 
Michigan to the next step 
after they saw their season 
end in the second round of the 
tournament.
“I am excited and honored 
to be able to work at a 
phenomenal place like the 
University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Sanchez said. “Kim and her 
staff have done an incredible 
job in Ann Arbor, their success 
is on the rise, and I am looking 
forward to working with such 
an incredible team of staff and 
players.”

“The program 
has taken a 
step forward to 
stability”


In the past few days, 
Michigan recruiting has 
continued its rampage 
on the recruiting trail 
and added another four 
elite talents to its 2019 
and 
2020 
recruiting 
classes.
It all began on July 1st 
with the commitment 
from four-star running 
back Eric Gray — the 
nation’s top-ranked all-
purpose back. Picking 
Michigan over Alabama, 
Penn State, Texas A&M 
and others, Gray looks to 
become a lethal weapon 
in Wolverine coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
traditional 
offense.
The 
Memphis, 
Tenn. 
native 
was 
smitten 
with 
Michigan 
after 
his official visit. When 
he was in Ann Arbor, 
Gray got to stay with 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson and met with 
current running backs 
senior 
Karan 
Higdon 
and junior Chris Evans.
But what really put Gray 
over the top was the 
encouraging words from 
Harbaugh himself.
“You’re talking to coach 
Harbaugh 
and 
he’s 
telling you how good 
you are,” Gray told The 
Michigan Insider. “He’s 
been on a championship 
team. He’s been to the 
Super Bowl. And for 
him, having been to the 
Super 
Bowl, 
coached 
at the 49ers, to tell me 
how good I was — that I 
can come in and make a 
big impact — it blew my 
mind to say that.”
After 
Gray’s 
surefire 
commitment, the next 
two dominoes to fall 
were three-star strong-
side defensive end David 
Ajabo 
and 
four-star 
defensive tackle Denver 
Warren. 
Ajabo 
adds 
to a fast-growing and 
heavy-hitting 2019 class 
while 
the 
Wolverine 

faithful will have to 
bide their time before 
seeing Warren at the 
Big House after his 2020 
graduation date.
Born 
in 
Nigeria 
and 
raised 
in 
Scotland, 
Ajabo has only played 
football for one year—
but already is showing 
elite 
athleticism 
that will make him a 
versatile piece of any 
defense. 
Highlighting 
that athleticism, Ajabo 
posted 
a 
video 
to 
Twitter back in May 
documenting a personal-
best 10.93-second 100-
yard dash attempt.
Announcing 
his 
commitment on Twitter, 
Ajabo 
expressed 
how 
grateful he was that 
he ended up playing a 
sport he knew little-to-
nothing 
about. 
Ajabo 
came to America in hopes 
of 
playing 
basketball, 
but 
his 
physicality, 
size and speed allowed 
him to quickly excel at 
football and now get his 
own locker room in Ann 
Arbor.
Becoming 
the 
third 
commit 
in 
the 
2020 
class, Warren is a beast 
at defensive end and will 
most certainly add to 
the ethos of a dominant 
Michigan defensive line.
At 
6’3”, 
300-pounds, 
Warren 
felt 
very 
confident 
about 
his 
future after a mid-June 
visit and immediately 
placed the Wolverines 
in a final group with 
Cincinnati, 
Illinois, 
Minnesota 
and 
Penn 
State. 
While 
already 
tagged 
with 
a 
four-
star rating, Warren has 
nowhere to go but up. 
The big man will look to 
build his toolset in his 
upcoming junior season.
Warren’s 
commitment 
marked 
Michigan’s 
second four-star recruit 
in two days and a bold 
statement 
from 
the 
recruiting staff.
Rounding out the week 

was 
three-star 
safety 
Quinten Johnson.
Johnson’s commitment 
came 
as 
no 
surprise 
to the Wolverines, as 
Johnson’s 
place 
with 
Michigan was all but 
locked 
up 
after 
his 
mid-June 
visit. 
After 
his 
commitment, 
the 
Washington D.C.-native 
was enthusiastic about 
his 
future 
with 
the 
Wolverines.
“The thing that attracted 
me to Michigan is the 
university’s 
prestige 
both on and off the 
field,” 
Johnson 
told 
The Michigan Insider. 
“It’s 
truly 
the 
best 
university to get both 
big-time academics and 
athletics. The plan put 
in place both on and off 
the field sets me up for 
the rest of the life and 
I was able to make a lot 
of connections with a 
lot of people while I was 
there.”
As pundits analyze his 
game, Johnson was quick 
to draw comparisons to a 
former Michigan legend 
— 
Cleveland 
Browns 
safety Jabrill Peppers.
“The 
player 
that 
I 
was compared to the 
entire trip was Jabrill 
Peppers,” Johnson said. 
“They want me to play 
the same as him in the 
Viper position, mainly 
on defense and punt 
return, with minimum 
of 
offense 
and 
also 
earning playing time as 
a freshman.”
With 
Johnson’s 

commitment, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
2019 

recruiting class ranked 
jumped to third in the 
nation and first in the 
Big Ten — sitting only 
behind 
Alabama 
and 
Texas A&M.
Needless 
to 
say, 
if 
Michigan 
continues 
its 
intensity 
on 
the 
recruiting 
trail, 
its 
talent-base will continue 
to grow and with it even 
larger expectations.

Recruiting Update: Michigan 
adds four prospects to classes

FOOTBALL

Shea Patterson signs with Rangers

Michigan 
football 
quarterback Shea Patterson 
signed a contract with the 
Texas Rangers as reported 
by the Dallas Morning 
News on Tuesday.
Not to worry, Wolverines 
fans, as the contract is set 
for 2019 after this upcoming 
football season. Patterson 
participated fully in spring 
practices and will compete 
with redshirt sophomore 
Brandon Peters, redshirt 
freshman Dylan McCaffrey 
and freshman Joe Milton.
NCAA rules allow players 
to become professional in 
one sport while retaining 
their collegiate eligibility 
in another. Many have 
taken advantage of this 
permission, 
including 
to 
ensure a position on a major 
league roster regardless of 
the sport.
Patterson 
hasn’t 
played 
competitive 
baseball 
in nearly three years — 
since his junior season of 
high school for Calvary 
Baptist 
Academy. 
After 
he 
transferred 
to 
IMG 
Academy for his senior 
season, he did not play, as he 
became an early enrollee at 
Ole Miss.
Still, the Rangers sought to 
add the former-high school 
third baseman to their farm 

system when they drafted 
him in the 39th round in the 
MLB Draft last month.
It isn’t entirely uncommon 
for a quarterback to be 
drafted 
to 
the 
Major 
Leagues. 
For 
instance, 
Michigan legend Tom Brady 
was drafted by the now-
defunct Montreal Expos in 
the 1995 MLB draft despite 

not playing baseball in 
college.
This year, the Oakland 
Athletics drafted Oklahoma 
quarterback Kyler Murray 
with the ninth overall pick 
in the draft. Murray intends 
to play one final season 
of college football for the 
Sooners before reporting for 
Spring Training in March 
2019. 
Unlike 
Patterson 
though, 
Murray 
played 
two seasons of baseball in 
college for Texas A&M. In 
2017 as a left fielder, Murray 
struggled, hitting just .122 
in 27 games. However, this 
season, 
Murray 
played 

center field and hit .296 with 
10 home runs and 47 RBI.
Before 
transferring 
to 
Michigan, Patterson arrived 
in Oxford, Miss. as a much-
heralded recruit for the 
Rebels. 247sports ranked 
him as the top quarterback 
in his class — the very 
same class as Wolverine 
teammate Peters — and the 
fourth-best player overall.
For Ole Miss, Patterson 
played 10 games in two 
season, passing for 3139 
yards and 23 touchdowns. 
Last year, before suffering 
a right knee injury against 
Louisiana 
State 
in 
his 
seventh game of the season, 
Patterson threw for 2,259 
yards and 17 touchdowns 
with a passer rating of 
151.5. Michigan’s combined 
quarterback trio of John 
O’Korn, 
Wilton 
Speight 
and Peters combined for a 
mere 2,226 touchdowns, a 
paltry nine touchdowns and 
a meager 110.3 passer rating 
in 13 games.
Patterson 
will 
look 
to 
improve on the Wolverine 
quarterbacks’ 
lackluster 
season 
Sept. 
1 
when 
Michigan takes on Notre 
Dame in South Bend, Ind.
Come 
February 
though, 
Patterson could consider 
forgoing 
his 
final 
year 
of 
eligibility 
for 
the 
Wolverines and pursue a 
baseball career.
