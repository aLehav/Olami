Interest wanes in last debate

At watch party,
already-decided
voters less focused
on policies
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
As an already-decided voter,
the differences between the for-
eign policies of President Barack
Obama and Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney in

Monday's debate mattered little
to Krystal Williams, a Rackham
graduate student.
In the Annenberg Auditorium
at the Ford School of Public Pol-
icy, most of the 200 students in
attendance seemed to agree with
Williams's sentiment. Compared
to the first debate three weeks
ago, students didn't seem to
engage as much throughout the
last matchup between Republi-
can presidential nominee Mitt
Romney and President Barack
Obama Monday night.
There was less cheering, less

clappingand more side conversa-
tions un-related to the election.
For many, the last debate was
not so much a chance to hammer
out a final decision, but a chance
to affirm a choice they already
made weeks ago.
"By this debate, I already
knew, honestly," Williams said.
"But it was helpful for me to get
a better gist of where they were
individually with their policies."
Only 5 percent of the audience
reported that they were unde-
cided, compared to the majority
of students who responded that

they alreadysupported Obamaor
Romney, according to an iClicker
poll staged by event organizers.
Public Policy graduate student
Haven Allen - chairman of the
Domestic Policy Corp, the group
that organized the watch party
- said he agreed that the dimin-
ished enthusiasm may be due to
the fact that many students have
already determined their vote.
He anticipated that some stu-
dents had grown weary of the
election process, the repetitive
attacks by each candidate and the

questions three of
10 contenders for
board
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
About 50 members of the
University's Senate Assem-
bly gathered at their monthly
meeting to question candidates
for the University's Board of
Regents at a forum held in
Palmer Commons Monday
afternoon.
Candidates discussed a
wide range of topics, includ-
ing whether the University's
focus should be on research or
teaching, the number out-of-
state students at the Univer-
sity, tuition hikes and the role
of athletics at the University.
While there are 10 candi-_
dates running for positions on
the board, only four attended
the forum: Republican Rob
Steele, Democrats Mark Bern-
stein and Shauna Ryder Diggs,
and Eric Borregard, the Green
Party's candidate. The group
was presented with a ques-

tion and each candidate was
allowed one minute to answer.
Due to the format of the event,
candidates did not get a chance
to respond to each other.
Each was quick to highlight
their connection to the Uni-
versity: Steele, Bernstein and
Diggs are all alumni, and Bor-
regard said his son attended
the University.
The candidates acknowl-
edged that one of the most
important responsibilities as
regent would be to select the
University's next president,
as University President Mary
Sue Coleman plans to retire in
2014.
They discussed how the new
president should balance the
diverse needs of the University
and successfully manage the
ever-changing budget. Steele
said the new president must
also provide creative solutions
for declining state and federal
budget appropriations, while
Diggs said he or she must also
lead by consensus and encour-
age efficiency to conserve the
University's resources.
Bernstein said the next
president must address the
transformative changes in

Panel discusses
'Republican War
on Women'
By BETHANY BIRON
ManagingNews Editor
At a forum on women's rights
on Monday afternoon, tension
among attendees seemed to
mirror the rising discord and
polarization within Congress
on gender politics this election
cycle.
A crowd ofabout150 students,

faculty and Ann Arbor residents
packed into the Hatcher Gradu-
ate Library to listen to promi-
nent feminist figures discuss the
plight of American women amid
a transforming political culture.
The event, titled "The Repub-
lican War on Women," spurred
outcry amongstudents and local
officials who expressed concern,
that the University was demon-
strating a liberal bias and defy-
ing campaign finance laws by
using public funding to support
a partisan event.
LSAseniorRachelJankowski,
chair of the University's chapter

of College Republicans, drafted
a letter to University Provost
Philip Hanlon, urging Univer-
sity officials to cancel the forum
and noted that legal action may
be taken against the University.
"As a woman and the chair
of the College Republicans, I
am incredibly offended that
the University of Michigan has
the audacity to promote such a
blatantly fallacious forum," she
wrote in the letter. "This is an
insult to every woman who has
ever supported the Republican
Party and its candidates, and

al-Hassan.
Opponents of Syria have
blamed the regime in Damas-
cus for the al-Hassan's killing
in a Beirut car bomb on Friday.
With Lebanon already tense and
deeply divided over the civil war
next door, the assassination has
threatened to drag the country
back into the kind of sectarian
strife that plagued it for decades
- much of it linked to Syria.
In the Lebanese capital, sol-
diers backed by armored personal
carriers with heavy machine
guns took up position on major
thoroughfares and dismantled
roadblocks. At times, troops
exchanged gunfire with Sunni
gunmen.
Al-Hassan was a Sunni who
challenged Syria and its pow-
erful Lebanese ally, the Shiite
militant group Hezbollah. The
uprising in Syria is dominated
by the Sunni majority fighting
Syrian President Bashar Assad,
who like many in his regime is a
member of the Alawite sect - an
offshoot of Shiite Islam. Lebanon
and Syria share similar sectarian
divides that have fed tensions in
both countries.
Most of Lebanon's Sunnis have
backed Syria's mainly Sunni reb-
els, while Lebanese Shiites tend
to back Assad.
The assassination has imper-
iled Lebanon's fragile political
balance. Many politicians blamed
Damascus for the killing and
angry protesters tried to storm
the government palace after
al-Hassan's funeral on Sunday,
venting their rage at leaders they
consider puppets of a murderous
Syrian regime. But were pushed
back by troops who opened fire in
the air and lobbed volleys of tear
gas.
Meanwhile, cease-fire efforts
by U.N. and Arab League envoy to
Syria Lakhdar Brahimi appeared
to be faltering.

Robert Champion, Sr, left, Pam Champion, center, and attorney Chris Chestnut, speak aftera sentencing hearing fon
Brian Jones, the first ofa dozen defendants to be sentenced in last year's hazing death of Florida A&M drum major Rob-
ert Champion, Jr.
First of 12 defendants sentenced in
FAMU drum major hazing lawsuit

First defendant
played minimal role
in incident
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - The
first of a dozen defendants to be
sentenced in last year's hazing
.death of a Florida A&M drum
major avoided jail time when he
received his punishment Mon-
day, but he will spend more than
two years under close supervi-
sion.
Brian Jones was given six
months of community control,
which strictly limits his free-
dom with measures including
frequent check-ins with proba-
tion officials. Following that, the
23-year-old from Parrish, Fla.,
will serve another two years of
probation. He's also required to
perform 200 hours of commu-
nity service.
Judge Marc Lubet said Jones's
role in the hazing death of Robert
Champion was relatively mini-
mal and that Jones did not beat
or hit Champion. Champion died
last November after being beaten
by fellow band members dur-
ing a hazing ritual aboard a bus
parked outside an Orlando hotel
after a football game.
"This young man's part in
this horrible act ... as compared

with many others from what I've
seen is minimal," Lubet said. "It
was an isolated incident in this
man's life for which he's shown
remorse."
Defense attorney Alisia
Adamson noted that only two
of the 90 witnesses even said he
was on the bus.
Eleven other band members
are awaiting trial on felony haz-
ing charges, while another band
member faces a misdemeanor
hazing count.
Jones had entered ano-contest
plea Oct. 9 to the third-degree
felony hazing charge after ini-
tially pleading not guilty. The
maximum penalty for the charge
was five years in prison.
Champion's parents 'and
friends say the drum major was
a vocal opponent of hazing, but
finally relented last November
and got aboard "Bus C," which
was known for hazing.
Pam and Robert Champion Sr.
both attended Monday's sentenc-
ing.
Speaking directly to Jones,
Pam Champion challenged the
idea that his role had been minor,
saying: "You and I know that's
not true. You played a critical
role."
She carried a picture of Cham-
pion with her to the podium
before she spoke.

"You won't be able to put it out
if your mind...It will haunt you,"
she told Jones.
Jones said in a recorded
audio statement with investiga-
tors that he was on the bus when
another hazing victim - Lis-
sette Sanchez - went through
the ritual. But Jones told police
that he only retrieved his light-
er and left to smoke, getting off
the bus before Champion got
on.
The defendant's mother, Jac-
queline Jones, told the court
that her son was an honest per-
son and that "he shared with me
he had nothing to do with it"
Brian Jones tearfully apolo-
gized to the Champion family
in court.
"No family should have to
go through what you've gone
through," he said.
After the sentencing, Pam
Champion said she gave Jones
credit for "taking responsibil-
ity" in the case.
"Initially my reaction was
disappointment, but I do under-
stand," she said. "The mere fact
that Brian stepped up and took
the initiative, which should be
what everyone does ... is basi-
cally what we're looking for.
The whole thing is people being
accountable for what they have
done."

After not properly

In a verdict that sent shock

community, an Italian court
convicted seven experts of man-

to adequately warn residents of
the risk before an earthquake
struck central Italy in 2009, kill-
ing more than 300 people.
The defendants, all promi-

to six years in prison.
Earthquake experts world-
wide decried the trial as ridicu-
lous, contending there was no
way of knowing that a flurry of

quake.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- South Korean activists float-
ed balloons carrying tens of
thousands of anti-Pyongyang
leaflets into North Korea on
Monday, eluding police who
had disrupted an earlier launch
attempt due to threats from
North Korea.
North Korea's military
warned last week that it would
strike if the South Korean activ-
ists carried through with their
plan to fly balloons carryingthe
propaganda leaflets across the
border. South Korea pledged to
retaliate if it was attacked.
South Korean police, citing
security concerns, had sent
hundreds of officers Monday to
seal off roads and prevent the
activists and other people from
gathering at an announced
launch site near the border.
Residents in the area were also
asked to evacuate to under-
ground facilities, according to
local official Kim Jin-a.
Later in the day, some of the

activists, mostly North Korean
defectors, moved to another
site near the border that was
not guarded by police and car-
ried out the launch of the bal-
loons. South Korea's Defense
Ministry said it was closely
monitoring North Korea's mili-
tary movements but there were
no suspicious activities.
Before taking action Mon-
day, the South Korean govern-
ment had implored activists to
stop their campaign, but had
cited freedom of speech in not
making further attempts to
intervene.
South Korean activists have
in the past sent leaflets across
the border, and North Korea has
issued similar threats to attack
without following through. But
Seoul's Yonhap news agency
reported Monday that the ban
on entering the border area was
imposed as South Korea detect-
ed that North Korea had uncov-
ered artillery muzzle covers
and deployed troops to artillery
positions in possible prepara-
tion for an attack. Yonhap cited
no source for the information.
Defense Ministry spokesman
Kim Min-seok told reporters
Monday that North Korea was
believed to have acted in line
with carrying out its threat.

He declined to elaborate on the
North's army movement as that
was confidential military infor-
mation.
He said South Korea had
bolstered its military readiness
following the North's threat
and would "strongly" retaliate
if attacked.
The activists said they float-
ed balloons carrying about
120,000 leaflets critical of
North Korea's young leader
Kim Jong Un and his country's
alleged human rights abuses.
They said they wanted to let
North Korean people know the
true nature of their country.
"We could not delay our
plans to send anti-North Korea
leaflets because it is our love
toward our northern brothers,"
the activists wrote in a state-
ment posted on the website of
Seoul-based Free North Korea
Radio, one of civic organiza-
tions involved in the leafleting.
Lead activist Park Sang-hak
had said the ban on entering the
border area was tantamount to
yielding to Pyongyang's threat.
"It's .surrender. It's clearly
surrender," he said.
On Monday, the top U.S.
envoy on North Korea urged
Pyongyang to stop issuing
destabilizing threats.

Ruler's trip to-Gaza
the first for a head
of state since 2007
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip
(AP) - When the ruler of
Qatar arrives in the Gaza Strip
on Tuesday, he will hand the
Palestinian territory's Hamas
rulers their biggest diplomatic
victory since taking power five
years ago.
The first head of state to
visit Hamas-controlled Gaza,
the emir will deliver more than
$250 million in aid, a move that
will deepen the Islamic mili-
tant group's control of Gaza
and which reflects the rising
influence of the Muslim Broth-
erhood across the region.
The Brotherhood now gov-
erns Egypt, and Islamic par-
ties have made gains elsewhere
in the region since last year's
popular revolts that became
known as the Arab Spring.
Qatar has been a key ally of the
movement, which includes the
Palestinian offshoot Hamas.
The visit by Sheik Hamad
bin Khalifa Al Thani comes
over the deep reservations
of the Palestinian president,
Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas oust-
ed Abbas' forces in Gaza dur-
ing its June 2007 takeover of
the territory, leaving the presi-
dent in control only of the West
Bank.
In a phone conversation on
the eve of the visit, Abbas wel-
comed the emir's intentions
to help the people of Gaza,
under an Israeli-led blockade
since the Hamas takeover, but
reminded the Qatari leader
that he remains the interna-
tionally recognized leader of
the Palestinians.
. "He stressed the necessity
to preserve the legitimate rep-
resentation of the Palestinian
people ... and he asked him to
urge Hamas in Gaza to go for
reconciliation and .to end this
split," said Abbas' spokesman,
Nabil Abu Rdeneh.
Another Abbas aide, Nimr
Hamad, used even stronger
language. "Such visits give
Hamas the impression that the
visitors recognize their rule

and that would reinforce the
split and not help the reconcili-
ation," he said.
On Monday, however,-it was
clear that the trip was pro-
ceeding.
A late night statement from
the office of Egypt's President
Mohammed Morsi said his
country welcomed the emir's
visit to Gaza, which it said
were part of Egypt's effort "to
break the siege on the people"
of the territory.
A convoy of some 30 brand
new SUVs and minivans, along
with several dozen Qatari
security men, crossed through
the Egyptian border in prepa-
ration for the visit.
Streets were decorated
' with white and maroon Qatari
flags and signs thanking the
Gulf nation for its support.
Hamas' Interior Ministry,
which oversees security, said
it had a "well prepared plan"
to protect the emir, deploying
thousands of security men and
blocking roads to Gaza City's
main soccer stadium, where
the Qatari leader was expected
to address a packed audience.
"No doubt the visit is very
important. I hope, as many
others do, that he will work
again to achieve the nation-
al reconciliation," said Ihad
Awad, a 29-year-old civil ser-
vant.
Qatar has played a key role
in the reconciliation pro-
cess. Earlier this year, the
emir brought together Abbas
and Hamas' supreme leader
in exile, Khaled Mashaal,
to make a deal. Under the
arrangement, Abbas was to
lead an interim unity govern-
ment to pave the way for new
elections in the Palestinian
territories.
That deal, like previ-
ous reconciliation attempts,
quickly foundered, in large
part because of opposition by
Gaza's Hamas leaders.
In a statement, Hamas said
the emir's arrival had deep
significance. "It is the first
visit by an Arab leader at this
level to Gaza," it said. "This
breaks the political isolation of
the government and opens the
door to break the siege."

N.Y. maternity ward nurse testifies
about scuffle with Douglas Kennedy

RFK's son accused
of physical
harassment, child
endangerment
MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. (AP)
- A maternity ward nurse testi-
fied in tears Monday that a son
of the late Sen. Robert F. Kenne-
dy twisted;her arm and kicked
another nurse to the floor as he
tried to leave a suburban hospi-
tal with his newborn son.
The nurses tried to stop
Douglas Kennedy because there
had been no order for the baby's
release "and I felt there was a
security risk," said the witness,
Anna Lane.
She said Kennedy told her he
didn't need permission.
Kennedy went on trial Mon-
day in Mount Kisco Town Court
on charges of harassment and
child endangerment. He calls
the charges absurd. He says he
was just taking the baby, 2-day-
old Anthony Boru Kennedy, for
some fresh air outside Northern
Westchester Hospital.
But nurses testified that
would have been very irregular.
Angela Adamo said that when
Kennedy approached the nurs-
es' station with his request, she
tried to dissuade him because
it "didn't seem to make much
sense to me."
She also said the baby, in a
hat and blanket, wasn't appro-
priately dressed for a January
evening.
Kennedy, the baby cradled in
his right arm, was not persuad-
ed and moved to the elevator
and stairwell, where Lane and
another nurse, Carrie Luciano,
tried to block the way, Lane tes-
tified.
"He grabbed my left hand...
and twisted my arm," Lane said.
"He kicked Carrie and she went
flying in one direction and he
went in the other direction."

video for Judge John Donohue,
who is hearing the case without
a jury. The video showed Luci-
ano falling to the floor near the
elevator but did not show what
caused her fall.
Lane broke down during
her testimony and on cross-
examination said recounting
the incident was traumatic. But
Kennedy's lawyer, Robert Got-
tlieb, pointed out that she had
gone on NBC's "Today" show in
February, "with a heck of a lot
more people watching than are
in this courtroom" to talk about
it.
He also got Lane to say she is
contemplating a lawsuit, read-
ing from her lawyer's settle-
ment offer to Kennedy, which
was rejected.
The witnesses testified about
a flurry of alarms that were set
off during the incident. One
blared when Kennedy alleg-

edly took a security band off the
baby boy. Two hospital-wide
alarms - "code purple" and
"code pink" - were called in to
declare a disorderly situation
and a missing baby..
Defense lawyer Celia Gordon
said the "code pink" was inap-
propriate because it's meant for
baby abductions. Nurse Angela
Adamo said she ordered the
"code pink" when she heard
someone say, "He's taking the
baby." But she also testified that
she never thought Kennedy
would fail to return with the
infant.
In her opening statement,
Gordon said Kennedy was act-
ing on instinct rather than
intent when he kicked at Lane.
But prosecutor Amy Puerto
said Kennedy did not stop until
he encountered a security guard
on a stairwell. She alleged he
said to the guard, "Do you know
who I am?"

Election an effort
to unify groups
against President
Viadmir Putin
MOSCOW (AP) - President
Vladimir Putin has had nothing
but mockery for the protesters
who have taken to the streets
against him in unprecedented
numbers. Russia's opposition,
he said, is no more than a gag-
gle of Internet dwellers with
"no unified program, no clear
and comprehensible way of
achieving their unclear goals,
and nobody who can actually
do something."
The opposition has set out to
prove him wrong by formally
choosing its leaders through
an online election that ended
Monday night. Nearly 82,000
voted in the election, which
was intended to help the oppo-.
sition present a more united
front against the Kremlin and
find a way to broaden its appeal
as enthusiasm for streets pro-
tests fades.
Alexei Navalny, a charis-
matic corruption fighter who
is a rock star among the protest
leaders, won the most votes,
confirming his leadership role
among the diverse collection
of liberals, leftists and nation-
alists who make up the anti-
Putin opposition.
The elections will clarify
"which people, which methods
and which ideology have the
most support," Navalny said in
an interview.
Navalny and his supporters
dominated a three-week series
of debates among the candi-

dates, a process some of his
rivals derided as his "corona-
tion."
Navalny won nearly 44,000
votes in the election, while a
sharp-tongued, larger-than-
life poet, novelist and colum-
nist Dmitry Bykov came second
followed by Garry Kasparov,
a former world chess cham-
pion turned opposition leader.
Ksenia Sobchak, a glamorous
TV host who became a face of
Moscow protests, also made a
strong performance, finishing
fourth with more than 32,000
votes.
Throughout the weekend,
thousands of Russians, many
of them middle-aged or older,
stood in long lines on a central
Moscow square to register to
vote. Those with better Inter-
net skills registered online.
They had to prove their iden-
tity either by transferring a
token amount, under the equiv-
alent of SO cents, from their
bank account or sending a pho-
tograph of themselves holding
their passport.
Despite a heavy police pres-
ence and occasional visits from
pro-Kremlin activists, the
event was peaceful and festive,
with classic Russian rock songs
playing over speakers. The vot-
ing was supposed to end Sun-
day night, but was extended for
a day after a barrage of hacker
attacks took down the servers
for most of Saturday.
Pressure on the opposi-
tion has increased since Putin
began his third term as presi-
dent in May. Protest leaders
have come under criminal
investigation, been called in
for questioning and had their
homes and offices searched.

Candidates need new approach to women voters
f this year's presidential debates have proven anything, it's that
candidates will do or say anything it takes to sway voters. In the
second debate, issues pertaining specifically to women were dis-
cussed at length. Both candidates spoke about their concern for wom-
en's salaries, what they've done in the past to level the playing field
and future plans to continue their efforts. This discussion (and lack
thereof) demonstrated the need for a more progressive understanding
of women and women's issues in the political sphere, particularly that
political candidates need to change their approach when appealing to

NOTABLE QOABLE.
Well, governer, we also have fewer
horses and bayonets."
- President Barack Obama retorted to GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's
remark about the Navy having fewer ships than any time since 1916.

Dorm room drama

women voters.
In the second debate between President
Barack Obama and Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney, the candidates were
asked how gender and other inequalities would
be rectified. Obama spoke to the enactment of
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act during his first
week in office, which offers equal pay to women
and men who perform the same jobs. He also
mentioned his belief that insurance companies
should provide coverage for contraceptives,
calling it an economic issue as well as a health
care concern.
Romney touted his decision to hire women
in his cabinet as governor of Massachusetts and
promised a stronger economy, which would
provide women with the opportunity for more
flexible scheduling. The former Massachusetts
governor also stated that employers shouldn't
be coerced into providing contraception cov-
erage, and that Planned Parenthood funding
should be cut.
The last debate showed the need to alter
the campaign's approach to female voters.
Women account for 52 percent of voters and
it really isn't enough to merely speak to wom-
en's issues -politicians must act to rectify
them.
But the way the candidates are approaching
female voters makes it seem as though women
are not the core of the voters, but rather just

another small constituency or demographic
whose votes are needed to win the election.
.It's simply not enough to speak of past legis-
lation - there has to be a concerted effort to
make changes.
Both Obama and Romney's approaches
toward women cannot be superficial or offen-
sive. It's not just enough to wear pink brace-
lets like those that adorn Obama's wrists or
have "binders full of women" to hire during
Romney's term as governor. These issues
need to be addressed directly through leg-
islation. The candidates are only inclined to
speak to their past accomplishments rather
than bringing about actual legislative change
in terms of equal pay and job availability.
Each candidate must realize the need to
approach women's issues as topics that per-
tain to everyone, not a special interest group.
The gender pay gap does not just affect
underpaid women - it also affects their fam-
ilies and dependents. Issues such as contra-
ception availability and abortion also provide
broader implications for American society as
a whole. On Nov. 6, American voters - pre-
dominantly women - will choose the next
president, and that president should be one
who understands that women's issues don't
pertain solely to American women, but to
society as a whole.

As a second semester trans-
fer student, I had a tough
choice to make going into
my sophomore
year: would -I
continue living
in the dorms,
get a room in my =
fraternity house
or begin a long,
possibly futile
search for off-
campus housingPJAMES
Juggling BRENNAN
school, student
organizations
and pledging, I dropped the idea
of looking for a new place and nar-
rowed my options to University
housing and my fraternity. Looking
to avoid the constant distractions
of partying and living with 23 of my.
best friends, I chose the dorm over
my fraternity. I made a big mistake.
Don't get me wrong. Mosher-Jor-
dan Residence Hall is a great place to
live - good people around me and all
the amenities I need (not to mention
a place to get away from my social
life). The problem is all money.
Over the past year, my financial
situation has changed drastically.
With this change has come the
need to save money in every way
possible, especially when it comes
to big costs like housing and food.
Much to my dismay, the University
failed to subsidize my room and
board. Right now, the cost for my
residence hall, excluding food, is
nearly $1,000 per month.
Along with the price to share a
bedroom, bathroom and study areas,
I'm forced to shell out cash for a
meal plan too. I understand that I
have food prepared for me and I only
have to take a short walk to get it, but

the dining hall isn't worth the cost.
The standard 150-block meal plan
costs $1,915. Subtract Blue Bucks
and Dining Dollars, and the average
cost per meal comes down to around
$11.43 a swipe. At this rate, I could
eat at restaurants on South Univer-
sity Avenue every single day and
still have money left over. Freshmen
could hypothetically live at the new
luxury apartments at Landmark,
cook for themselves and still pay less
than they do for a cramped double on
North Campus.
It should be noted freshmen do
choose whether to live in the resi-
dence halls or not. Like me, their off-
campus options will be very limited,
as most of the decent off-campus
housing has already been scooped up
by the time high-school students are
admitted to the University.
More important than money or
location, however, is community.
Especially for students with very
few friends at the University, the
people you meet and get to know in
a freshman hall become your first
real group of friends in college. Even
if you're like me and came to-Michi-
gan with plenty of close friends,
the dorms are a beneficial way to
meet new people and make friends
outside of your comfort zone. Liv-
ing off-campus could make it a lot
harder for freshman to obtain the
friends and social skills that college
demands. Whether you love them
or hate them, dorms are extremely
important in the way our University
functions. Because of thisthe costof
University housing and meals abso-
lutely has to go down.
I'll be the first to admit thatI made
a boneheaded decision by choos-
ing to live in the dorms yet again. I
don't need the community building

that University housing provides
and it would save me a huge amount
of money to live somewhere else.
Even my newly restored, $5-million
fraternity house would be cheaper
than what I pay now, but my fail-
ure to do the math ahead of time
doesn't excuse the University for
ripping off freshman.
'U' housing costs
the same as
Landmark.
If the University is serious about
keepingthe school diverse and acces-
sible to people of all backgrounds,
then it needs to stop overcharg-
ing for things like room and board.
Tuition costs increased yet again
this year, making Michigan harder
and harder for low-income students
to afford. Diversity is not just racial,
but also socio-economic. If they
don't have the money, freshmen stu-
dents will eventually begin to live
off-campus, which is detrimental to
community building, or stop coming
to the University altogether, favoring
more affordable schools.
We may very well see the school
lose either its sense of community,
cherished diversity and plurality -
or all three. What's for sure is that
if major costs like tuition, room and
board continue to increase, we will
soon find outthe hard way.

In college, many students are wary of the
unhealthy eating habits that often accompany
busy schedules and heavy course loads. The
"freshman 15" is a persistent fear. However,
there are also always a few who are deter-
mined to make those 15 pounds a loss instead
of a gain. Here at the University, many stu-
dents are especially concerned with their
health and establishing good habits.
But as with anything in life, too much of a
good thing can be a bad thing. Even though it
may be hard to believe, it's possible to be too
health-conscious.
In an effort to avoid the temptation of fast
food and midnight cookie deliveries, some
students go in the opposite direction and
become obsessed with exercise and calorie-
counting. This kind of obsession with healthy
eating is called othorexia. Though it isn't con-
sidered a clinical disorder, it causes severe
mental problems and sharp physical chang-
es. People who suffer from othorexia often
pore over nutritional facts and generally end
up dismissing the majority of food available
after deeming it "unhealthy." They become
increasingly concerned about exercise and
end up working out several times a day. When
they stray from their diets, they punish them-
selves with more exercise or skimpier meals
to compensate for the extra calories.
In college, it's very easy to fall into this kind
of obsession. When students try to be health-
ier, they often end up making a series of reso-
lutions or goals. Reaching our goals makes us
feel empowered, but that power can go to our
heads. We start wanting to control everything
and start setting even more restrictions with
fewer allowances.
I've felt this way. Since I came to college
I've been trying to be healthier, so I've noticed
firsthand how setting goals and restrictions
can become addicting. I once tried to see
how long I could last on only pretzel sticks
and Slimfast. I exercise several times a week,
sometimes as my break from studying. Ilook
at my body in the mirror every day looking
for the improvements that I know are there. I

don't have orthorexia, but I can see how easy
it is to become obsessed.
We believe we're being healthy, but this
kind of deprivation taxes our minds more
than we realize. What seems to be healthy
thinking becomes an unhealthy obsession.
Following a strict and specific diet robs the
body of the nutrients it would receive from
eating a variety of food. Additionally, it's not
mentally healthy to severely restrict our-
selves because restrictions end up consum-
ing our thoughts. One of my family friends
works out five times a day and eats a spe-
cific brand of organic peanut butter in place
of other snacks and meals. I once saw a girl
at the dining hall counting out six pieces of
boiled chicken and two spoonfuls of broccoli
for her dinner. This behavior isn't healthy.
As anxiety sets in, food becomes more of an
obstacle than a pleasure. Exercise turns into
an obligation instead of an amusement. As
college students we deal with enough stress.
Being healthy should be an achievement, not
an obligation.
Othorexia is just as dangerous to one's
mental stability as anorexia or bulimia. All
college students and other young adults
should be aware of the dangers of falling into
this kind of obsession. Wanting to improve
your eating habits and exercise routines is a
very respectable goal.
There's nothing wrong with eating fruit
for dessert or running through the Diag every
day. But we need to understand that obsessing
over health is actually not healthy at all. Col-
lege has given us the freedom to change our-
selves, to be that person that we have always
wanted to be, to look how we have always
wanted to look. With this freedom, how-
ever, we need to be cautious when we make
big changes to our habits and routines. There
needs tobea balance. Two days ago I worked
out at the CCRB for an hour and then ate two
pieces of chocolate pudding pie for dessert.
Balance achieved!

On Monday, the New York Times
published an article by Stephanie
Coontz titled "The Myth of Male
Decline." It addresses the perva-
siveness of women in the workplace
since the beginning of the feminist
movement and discusses whether
anything has truly changed. Coontz
contends that the "patriarchal divi-
dend" socio-economic privileging
of men hasn't disappeared from
the business world. While employ-
ment trends for women have curved
upward in recent years, they haven't
evened out, nor will they.
Women started at such a disad-
vantage that trending doesn't define
positioning. Coontz also observes
the phenomenon ofwomen at the top
gradually sacrificing their feminin-
ity for the more pertinent attributes
of a man. In this context, social val-
ues are defining the roles of women
in our society.
At Cornell, researchers submitted
fake resumes in response to job post-
ings. All factors were constant in the
resumes but one: parental status.
They found that mothers received
far fewer callbacks and, when hired,
their salaries were worth $11,000
less than non-parents without room
for promotion. Additionally, mothers
with children received half as many
callbacks as those without children.
What does this say about the val-
ues of the workplace? On one hand,
it's a matter of naive' assumption
- the misconception that working
mothers will inevitably prioritize
family over the work. On the other
hand, there's the assertion that
mothers ought to spend more time
withtheir kids than at work and thus
aren't ideal for the ruthless business

world. The problem with the latter is
that it doesn't give them the option -
who is a recruiter to make that deci-
sion for a grown woman?
The interesting part about all
of this is the gender bias of certain
jobs - four of every five teachers
and social workers are women. This
points to the stereotype that the
talents of women lie in nurturing,
development and support. These
talents are often given no credence
in the cutthroat environment of the
corporation.
However, I'd argue the other
way. According to the classical
"window-mirror" allegory of lead-
ership, true leaders "look out the
window" when giving' credit and
"look in the mirror" when delegat-
ing responsibility. That is to say,
while they're accountable for the
errors of the organization, they
should be careful not to take credit
for its successes, which should go to
those within the company. Sounds
like a mother's role to me. If you've
ever been on a plane you know what
I'm talking about. The baby who
cries the entire flight is the product
of poor parenting and lack of atten-
tion. The baby who plays in the
rows and smiles when she travels
is a charming example of maturity
and precociousness.
The point of all of this lies in
"femininity" itself. Coontz says the
issue pertainsto mothers identifying
too openly with the existential idea
of "woman," rather than as unique
individual women who also mother.
Motherhood does have applications
in the workplace - I would per-
sonally love it if every time I called
HR or customer service, my mom

answered the phone. I'd also love it
if my boss cared for her subordinates
even remotely as much as a mother
loves her kids.
The issue boils down to the stigma
of stereotypical "male vs. female"
qualities. Women who don't make it
home for dinner are frowned upon.
Men who get home early from work
to make that dinner are disgraced.
In true Darwinian biologi-
cal terms, Dad <em>should<em/>
weather the storm of the outside
world to bring home the goods,
while Mom <em>should<em/> sit in
the nest with the kids and keep them
warm.
Well, what if Mom could nest
somewhere else, say, in the office?
And what if she could retain the
qualities that make her "Mom" and
not the ones that make her "Boss"?
Perhaps if everyone in the work-
place warmed up to one another,
they might cooperate, set aside
their differences and operate as a
family unit. Think about that - the
office family. Certainly in <em>The
Office<em/> there's not a speck of
family anywhere; good thing too,
otherwise we might not have a TV
show worth watching. But the aver-
age workplace shouldn't resemble a
TV show.
We need to embrace the qualities
of women that make them women
and the qualities of mothers that
make them mothers. It's not appro-
priate for every manager to resem-
ble Steve McQueen or Christopher
Reeve. It might, in fact, do us well
to consider more Meryl Streeps or
Helen Mirrens forthe helm.

For a star with some of the best

pretty starkly. "The Last Time"
is over five minutes long, and
limps along lethargically with a
mopey orchestra telling you the
appropriate sad emoji to resemble
while listening. Presumably, the
song is supposed to be a serious
ballad-slash-duet with a serious
male singer (Gary Lightbody of
Snow Patrol) who awkwardly
dominates the song.
And as for the country in her
music ... there is no more country
in her music. There is absolutely
no reason, ever, for anyone to
classify T-Swift in the country
category anymore. She has offi-

line into non-country territory.

We get it. Break-ups are hard,
relationships can be tangly (espe-
cially when it's pouring rain) and
it's good to be pissed off some-
times.
These components work for
Taylor Swift; they are her bread
and butter, the very foundation
upon which her fans worship
her. And honestly, would you
really change your formula if
your album was projected to sell
a million copies in its first week?

JAROFF
From Page 1
Jaroff is most prominently
known for his role as the first
managing editor and founder
of Discover Magazine in 1980.
According to his son, Jaroff's
degree in electrical engineering
from the University sparked his.
interest in science, and while at
TIME, he identified a niche mar-
ket for science news and split off
to create his own publication.
"That was just a reflection of
his background and his excite-
ment over science and science
related issues," Peter Jaroff said.
Jaroff joined TIME as the mag-
azine's science editor and covered
in 1966, a historical decade of vast
scientific discoveries and ground-
breaking events. He wrote more
than 40 cover stories for the mag-
azine that addressed topics rang-
ing from "Race for the Moon" and
"Did Comets Kill the Dinosaurs?"
Peter Jaioff said his father
enjoyed his work as a reporter and
editor at the Daily, which laid the
foundation for Jaroff's career in
journalism.
"He loved it," Peter said. "Obvi-
ously his work on the Daily pre-
pared him for a long career in
journalism, and he never forgot
how important that was to him.
And he always had stories about
the deadline pressures, about

campaign rhetoric.
"This whole campaign cycle
has been in everybody's face so
much - watching TV, all the
debates," Allen said. "If you
haven't made up your mind yet, I
don't know whether you're wait-
ing for someone to screw up or
what it is. It's hard for me to see
that."
Aaron Kall, the director of the
University's debate program, said
another explanation for the apa-
thy of students might be the sub-
dued tone of this debate relative
to the others.
While Obama attacked Rom-
ney with zingers and sharper
criticism, still hoping to rebound
from his performance in the first
presidential debate, Romney was
more even-tempered, concen-

controversies on campus, about
people thinking he was a socialist
because of articles they printed in
the Daily."
In a Sept. 13, 2003 article by
Jaroff in TIME titled "HowI Won
the Michigan-Minnesota Game,"
Jaroff explained his experience
as freshman in the Big House. In a
tense moment in the game against
Minnesota with the Wolverines
trailing by one touchdown, Jaroff
took advantage of a silent moment
in the stadium to shout "Fumble,
ydu baaastards!" which was fol-
lowed by a Minnesota fumble.
Jaroff wrote that he was "picked
up and passed around the cheer-
ing student section" after Michi-
gan recovered the ball and went
on to win the game.
Jaroff also spread his infec-
tious passion for the University,
Peter Jaroff said, adding that
his father would have been very
proud of the outcome of Satur-
day's game against Michigan
State University.
"The whole family is die hard
Michigan fans. He loved Michi-
gan, he loved Michigan football.
I know somewhere up there, he
saw Michigan beat Michigan
State on Saturday and was just
thrilled about that," he said.
While most of his college peers
were unsure about their future
careers, Peter Jaroff said his
father always knew he wanted to
go into journalism, noting that his
trating on seeming presidential,
according to Kall.
Kall added that as a result
of Romney's unwillingness to
engage Obama this debate was
decidedly less contentious and
more substance-filled than the
others.
"(Obama) was really on the
offensive, and aggressive, and
trying to still make up for his
blunders in Denver," Kall said
referring to the first debate in
which Obama's performance was
strongly criticized.
"(Romney) wasn't going to
engage the President. He didn't
employ any zingers. He wanted
to seem presidential and above-
the-fray of regular politics," he
continued.
Despite the relatiyely unevent-
ful nature of the debate, some

both students and employees,
and whether to grant undoc-
umented residents in-state
tuition.
Bernstein said he fought
against 2006's Proposal 2 -
which banned the use of race in
public university admissions in
Michigan - and vowed to make
diversity a priority by using
geography and socioeconomic
class to increase diversity.
He added he supported in-
state tuition for undocumented
students because forcing high-
performance students to go to
another school on a formality is
a waste for the state and for the
University.
"This should be a place
that welcomes students, and
to exclude applicants simply
because of the misfortune of
their parents ..: is disgraceful,"
Bernstein said.
Diggs said increasing diver-
sity should begin in lqwer lev-
els of school, and admissions
officers must inform students
in middle and high school
what they need to do to be
accepted to the University.
She added that undocu-
mented Michigan taxpayers
deserve to have their children
pay in-state tuition, but noted
that if their parents do not pay
taxes it could complicate the
granting of in-state tuition.
Steele disagreed, say-
ing socioeconomic and geo-
graphic diversity are more
important, and the lack of
diversity at Michigan stems
from high school deficiencies
that should be addressed on a
state level.
"I don't see any general
benefit from the idea of speed-
ing ahead of time or going for
a certain percentage of each
race," Steele said. "We need to
go for quality that is going to
advance the whole society and
have everybody benefit."
He added: "Illegal, undocu-
mented potential students
should not have the same
opportunities as legal, in-state
Michigan residents."
The candidates also differed
in their views of the future size
of the student body.
Berstein said out-of-state
tuition subsidized in-state
students, and general enroll-
ment should be increased "just
a touch" to increase revenue
without decreasing quality.
Steele disagreed, and said
while the best out-of-state stu-
dents must still be recruited,

the University must always be
a place for the best students
from Michigan. He added that
out-of-state students do not
significantly affect revenue
because they also compose a
large portion ,of financial aid
recipients.
Diggs said the proportion of
out-of-state students should
not be increased just to aug-
ment profits and instead sup-
ports exploring other options.
She added that in-state stu-
dents should be given priority
because their parents pay state
taxes.
In closing statements, the
candidates acknowledged that
despite their differences, they
did have common ground on
areas like college affordability
and maintaining the University
as a nationally relevant univer-
sity.
"Sorry, Eric, I'm not a social-
ist, so I'm not going to agree
with you on much, but it was
great to hear that my two pos-
sible members of the board
that we had some places where
can definitely work together,"
Steele said, referring to Bor-
regard.
In an interview after the
forum, Diggs said she thought
the questions touched on the
most important issues, and
noted the importance of reach-
ing out to faculty.
"The faculty interacts with
the students every day, minute-
to-minute - they basically are
the University," Diggs said.
Steele said in an interview
that he was frustrated with
having only one minute to
answer, adding it has been dif-
ficult to get his message across
because the regents election is
overshadowed bythe presiden-
tial competition.
"Whether it's the faculty,
the parents in the U.P., wheth-
er it's the business owners in
the thumb or the high school
teachers in Grand Rapids, we
need to be meeting with all of
these people," he said.
In another interview Bern-
stein said it was important to
talk to faculty because they
are an important part of the
decision-making process at the
University
"Nobody knows this Univer-
sity better than many of the
people in this room and getting
the opportunity to speak about
these issues with this group
of stakeholders is invaluable,"
Bernstein said.

Alms to increase
jobs and help
country rebuild
post-earthquake
CARACOL, Haiti (AP) - Sec-
retary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton encouraged foreigners
to invest in Haiti as she and her
husband Bill led a star-studded
delegation gathered Monday to
inaugurate a new industrial park
at the center of U.S. efforts to help
the country rebuild after the 2010
earthquake.
Actors Sean Penn and Ben Still-
er, fashion designer Donna Karan
and British business magnate
Richard Branson were among
the luminaries at the opening of
the new Caracol Industrial Park,
which is projected to create thou-
sands of jobs more than 100 miles
from the quake-ravaged capital of
Port-au-Prince.
Hillary Rodham Clinton told
a roomful of investors gathered
for a luncheon that she had made
Haiti a priority when she became
secretary of state.
"We had learned that support-
ing long-term prosperity in Haiti
meant more than providing aid,"
she said. "It required investments
in infrastructure and the econo-
my that would help the Haitian
people achieve their own dreams.
"So we shifted our assistance
to investments to address some
of the biggest challenges facing
this country: creating jobs and
sustainable economic growth,"
she added.
Earlier Monday, thousands
of Haitians lined the roadway
to wave at her motorcade as it

wound its way from the newly
renovated airport in the seaside
city of Cap-Haitien. Clinton and
other U.S. officials, including
Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and
Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat
from Vermont, toured a housing
development for industrial park
workers supported by the U.S.
Agency for International Devel-
opment.
The secretary of state noted
there were three presidents gath-
ered in one room to celebrate the
opening: her husband, former
U.S. President Bill Clinton, cur-
rent Haitian President Michel
Martelly and his predecessor,
Rene Preval.
Bill Clinton, now a U.N. special
envoy for Haiti, arrived in Cara-
col separately from his wife.
The Clintons and their allies
hope that the $300 million indus-
trial facility will transform the
northern part of this impover-
ished country by providing thou-
sands of desperately needed jobs.
But some Haitians say the
industrial park does little more
than replicate failed efforts from
the past and will benefit outsid-
ers more than Haitians. They
also worry it will harm some of
the few pieces of undamaged
environment that still exist in
Haiti.
"It's really all-in on this proj-
ect, and there's a high bar to
deliver," said Laurent Dubois, a
historian who teaches at Duke
University and is author of
"Haiti: The Aftershocks of His-
tory.""It really needs to deliver
in a big way so that people will
think, yeah, this was the right
thing to do."
The stakes are high in large
part because the Clintons have
been so heavily involved.

sources oppose it," Irwin said.
"It's pretty roundly opposed by
people who are involved in the
system or people who depend

State Rep. Mark Ouimet (R-
Scio Twp.) said he is concerned
that the proposal gives ultimate
control of tax legislation to a
small group of legislators. He
noted that though Republicans
have tended to support the pro-
posal more than Democrats, he
is not in favor of it.
"If the state wanted to move to
a different type of taxing system
or a funding source, (Proposal5)
would hold that up and (the leg-
islation) would be held hostage
by 13 people," Ouimet said. "I
don't think that's healthy."
LSA senior Lauren Coffman,
the communications director
for the University's chapter of
College Democrats, wrote in
an e-mail interview that pas-
sage of Proposal 5 would inhibit
the necessary flexibility of the
Michigan lawmaking process.
"Lawmakers should have the
opportunity to legislate in the
way they believe best serves
the needs of their constituents,"
Coffman wrote. "By adding this
restriction to their powers, we
risk further legislative stale-
mates and roadblocks."
Coffman added that the
measure could have larger
implications on funding of infra-
structure throughout the state.
"A cap on tax dollars could
also mean budget cuts to insti-
tutions of higher learning, such
as the University of Michigan, as
other items become budget pri-
orities," Coffman wrote.
LSA senior Nicole Miller,
a member of the University's
chapter of College Republicans,
said changing the state constitu-
tion for tax legislation should be

considered more caretully. ness of tce proposal would make "It you lock the state into its

PROTEST

only further creates tension and
division."
Fellow members of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Republi-
cans mobilized in opposition to
the event and organized aprotest
on the steps of the library before
the meeting, carrying signs and
airing their grievances with
passersby.
LSA senior Brian Koziara, a
senior adviser to the University's
chapter of College Republicans,
said he felt the nature of the
event was oppressive to conser-
vative students.
"The title of this event really
seems to be laying blame on
Republicans, and since it's an
officially University sponsored
event, it seems like the Univer-
sity is taking sides on the issue,"
he said.
LSA senior Arielle Zupmore
echoed Koziara, saying she felt
the University was infringing
upon her rights to attend an
unbiased institution of higher
education.
"I was really upset, because
as a women who is a Republican
and very involved with the party,
I found it really, really embar-
rassing that I also have to call
myself a Wolverine at a school
that is sponsoring a partisan
event," she said.
Despite claims that the Uni-
versity breached state policy,
University spokeswoman, Kelly
Cunningham wrote in a state-
ment that the event was not in
violation of the Michigan Cam-
paign Finance Act because it was
purely informational and not
promotional.
"It was our understanding
that the event was never intend-
ed to endorse a political posi-
tion," Cunningham wrote. "It
was a thoughtful, critical analy-
sis of how the media has covered
the issues around gender in poli-
tics and the historical place of
women in the electorate. It was
very much an educational forum.
She added that holding events
that promote discourse among
diverse perspectives is one of the
University's primary objectives.
"This type of intelligent,
thoughtful and respectful dia-
logue among people of diverse
views makes the University of
Michigan such a special place,"
she wrote.

Susan Douglas, chair of
the Communications Studies
department and moderator of
the event, sought to dispel con-
cern over implications of the title
of the event, explaining that the
term "Republican War Against
Women" derives from a book
published in 1996 by Tanya
Melich that detailed the ideolog-
ical shifts of the GOP on women's
rights throughout history.
During the panel discussion,
Katha Pollitt, a writer for the
magazine The Nation said she
believes the Republican party
"sends out complicated vibes"
and conflicting messages, not-
ing an incident in which Repub-
lican presidential nominee Mitt
Romney told an Iowa newspaper
that he had no plansto enact anti-
abortion policies. His campaign
promptly rescinded the statement
Pollitt said.
"I think that he was sending
a message to say to pro-choice
moderate.Republicans -'It's OK
to vote for me. I'm still moder-
ate Mitt, the former governor of
Massachusetts, who was pro-
choice, who did Romneycare,"'
she said.
Rebecca Traister, a writer for
the online news site Salon.com
discussed the transformation of
the American political system
as women and minorities have
made increasing gains and taken
on leadership roles.
"Throughout history, we have
been run by one kind of person -
a white male person," she said.
"That's what the presidents have
looked like, a white guy. It's what
people with economic power
have looked like; it's what peo-
ple with academic power have
looked like. It's what power has
looked like in this country."
Anna Holmes, the founder of
the feminist blog Jezebel and a
columnist for The Washington
Post, spoke about an incident
last spring in which conserva-
tive pundit Rush Limbaugh
called Sandra Fluke, a student
at a Georgetown University who
advocated contraceptive rights,
a slut.
"I think that (women) saw in
Sandra a kindred spirit and they
were outraged that she was being
lambasted publicly," she said. "I
think a lot of younger women,
and older women, are tired of
having their sexuality called
into question when they actually
have somethingto say about any-
thing uncomfortable."
The room quickly grew heated

during a question-and-answer
session in which attendees
expressed concern over the lack
of Republican considerations on
the panel.
Cynthia Kallgren, the Repub-
lican running against U.S. Rep.
John Dingell (D-Mich.) in the
newly drawn fifteenth congres-
sional district, told the panel
she feels the Democratic Party
has failed to focus on issues
like unemployment and the
struggling economy, and she
challenged their protection of
women's rights.
"Unemployment ... is affect-
ing every woman in the state; it's
affecting these college students
here who want to go out and
get jobs," Kallgren said. "You
say that your party cares about
women, but your party doesn't
give a crap about women, or
they would be worried about the
economy, about paying the debt
and not leaving it on these young
people."
Traister countered, stating
that the panel was not advocat-
ing for Obama or Democratic
ideals, just considering varying
viewpoints, which was received
by cheers from the audience.
"I don't think anyone on the
panel has said Democrats are per-
fect for women," she said.
In an interview after the event,
LSA sophomore Emma Maniere
said though she identifies asa lib-
eral feminist, hearing opposing
viewpoints was helpful in under-
standing important issues in this
election cycle.
"Hearing what (conservatives)
have to say before the election,
it helps me cement my beliefs,
and hearing the opposition that
was so prevalent in the questions
afterwards, helps me recognize
that there is another side and
helps me balance that out and be
informed," she said.
In an interview after the event,
Douglas said while she is glad to
see that students are politically
active and motivated to stand
up for their beliefs, she felt the
claims by groups such as the.Col-
lege Republicans were unfound-
ed.
"As far as trying to challenge
the University's nonprofit sta-
tus, or suggest that it violated it
in some way, is just completely
ridiculous, grasping at straws,
and actually is very counter-
productive for students to try to
revoke the non-profit status of the
own university that they go to,"
she said.

sity's associate vice provost and
executive director of under-
graduate admissions, said in a
press release that the University
strives to stabilize enrollment
each year in order to maximize
resource use.
"This is the second consecu-
tive year that we have intention-
ally admitted fewer students
to our entering class," Spencer
said. "Our goal is to maintain
fairly stable enrollment num-
bers overall: This ensures that
enrollment is scaled to resourc-
es, which optimizes the educa-
tional environment for all our
students."
The entering class is almost
identical in gender breakdown
to last year's demographics,
with 49.96 percent of the stu-
dents identifying as female and
50.04 percent of the students
identifying as male.
The number of underrepre-
sented minority students fell
in this year's freshman class
by half a percentage point from
the previous entering class,
with 10 percent of the class
identifying as an underrepre-
sented minority student.
However, the number of stu-

American on campus increased
this year in both undergradu-
ate and graduate enrollment, at
more than a percentage point
for a total of 5.9 percent.
Hanlon explained the Uni-
versity's goals for size of the
student body are not based
solely on the incoming class,
but attempt to account for the
number of continuing students
and transfers as well.
Using the number of student-
earned credit hours, the Uni-
versity estimates the number
that will graduate in Decem-
ber, and models enrollment in
the spring to reassess its goals.
Over time, Hanlon said the Uni-
versity aims to decrease the
number of students from more
than 27,000to about 26,500.
"Ultimately I think it will
help with some of the conges-
tion in some of the concentra-
tions," Hanlon said. "If we
ratchet down the overall num-
ber of undergrads some, there
will be less congestion, less

instances when a student can't
get into a class they want to get
into and the bus system will be
less crowded."
Hanlon said that though the
College of Engineering and the
School of Kinesiology saw the
greatest increase in applica-
tions , the number of students
admitted to those colleges was
not altered.
"Applicant numbers have
gone up, selectivity has
improved and the yields have
gone up," Hanlon said.
He attributed growth in the
University's size to an unex-
pected growth in the yield
- the number of students
accepting admission out of the
acceptances extended. Since
the target number is based off
the previous year's yield, the
data compounds and contin-
ues to increase; generating an
unexpected increase in admis-
sions numbers.
"We've grown by accident,"
Hanlon explained.

Every time the No. 20 Michi-
gan football team walks into the
meeting room in Schembechler
Hall, it sees the samething.
An image of the Stagg Champi-
onship Trophygiventothevictor
of the Big Ten, has been plastered
on the screen before every team
meetingsince the start of confer-
ence play in early October. ,
The trophy isn't easily earned,
and Michigan coach Brady Hoke
has emphasizes its importance
every chance he gets: in team
meetings, in the locker room, on
the practice field.
There isn't a single game on
the Big Ten schedule that you
can overlook, Hoke has preached.
Every week is a "championship
week."
Somehow, the mantra hasn't
felt redundant for the Wolver-
ines.
"We want to hear about the
Big Ten trophy and Indianapolis
and all those things, because we
know that last year we didn't get
that accomplished," said fifth-

year senior center Elliott Mealer
on Monday.
"You need a reminder, need a
reminder every week whatyou're
playing for. We accept it and it's
not redundant. We need to hear
about it."
Mealer doesn't remember the
constant "championship week"
reminders happening lastseason,
a year in which the Wolverines
slipped up against underdog Iowa
and lost to Michigan State.
Those two losses effectively
put Michigan out of contention
for the program's 43rd Big Ten
title, something Hoke has des-
ignated as the team's ultimate
goal each season since the day he
stepped on campus as head coach.
Despite a 10-2 regular-season
record and a Sugar Bowl victory
over Virginia Tech in 2011-12,
Hoke and the players still deem
the season a "failure" because
they failed to win the conference
championship.
So, to ensure that the Wolver-
ines (3-0 Big Ten, 5-2 overall)
don't overlook any Big Ten oppo-
nent, Hoke has emphasized each
week as pivotal on the road to

Indianapolis. During Monday's
press conference, Hoke and the
three players who spoke must
have combined to say "champion-
ship week" a few dozen times.
And the players aren't just
repeating coachspeak - they
really believe it.
"I think we picked up (the
phrase) the first week Coach
Hoke said it," said senior defen-
sive lineman Will Campbell.
"Because every week is a champi-
onship week and we have to win
out."
Each victory is another step
forward. A month into the con-
ference slate, Michigan is 3-0.
Nebraska, its next opponent on
the chopping block, is 3-1 and is
the Wolverines' top competition
for the Big Ten Legends division
crown.
As far as regular-season games
go, this onewill have achampion-
ship feel to it.
"It's a'Who's next' mentality,"
Hoke added. "Who are you play-
ing next? As you know, Novem-
ber and October is when you win
championships.
"We'll have to play our best

football that we've played this
year."
Though Michigan has roses
painted throughout Schem-
bechler Hall and Michigan Stadi-
um, the team hasn't made the trip
to Pasedena, Calif. for the Rose
Bowl since 2007 - the program
hasn't endured a longer Rose
Bowl droughtsince 1957-64.
A win against Nebraska (2-1,
5-2) would vault the Wolverines
into a two-game lead over the
Cornhuskers with four games
remaining.
Barring an unforeseen col-
lapse, a date with Iowa (2-1, 4-3)
on Nov. 17 would likely be Michi-
gan's final challenge before the
Big Ten title game.
But that might be diving into
the future a little bit too quickly.
The Wolverines have a primetime
matchup with Nebraska in Lin-
coln on Saturday, and that's the
only thing on their minds.
"It's a championship game for
us," Mealer said. "Last week was
a championship game and the
week before that was.
"We're playing for the trophy,
and we control our own destiny."

this race like
my Big Ten Championship," Pas-
ternak said.
With its top nine runners
resting for next week, the Wol-
verines fielded their 'B' team to
compete at the EMU Fall Clas-
sic, and Pasternak won her first
collegiate event, finishing first
in the 5,000-meter race with a
personal-best time of 17:49.3.
"(McGuire) didn't want me
leading the race at the start, so
I just stayed with the front run-
ners in the beginning," Paster-
nak said. "Then at the mile, the
front pack split up and it was
just me and my teammate and a
few runners leading, and then at
about the halfway point I broke
away from them."
Redshirt junior Kaitlyn Pat-
terson finished second overall
with a time of 18:04.2, and the

said he was
encouraged by Pasternak's per-
formance, and attributed her
successful season finale to the
fact that she became physically
stronger as the season went on.
He noted that Pasternak was a
key member of the core group of
top Wolverines this season and
that her absence on the Big Ten
Championship lineup is strictly
due to the fact that he can only
bring nine runners to the event.
"With the Big Ten meet on
Sunday, we are obviously focus-
ing our energy on performing
well as a whole team," McGuire
said.
"We'll probably have a tough
practice sometime this week,

the review, which ended in con-

Freshman forward Andrew
Copp is on pace to score a goal in
every game he plays for the Mich-
igan hockey team.
That's a loaded statistic that
has Copp feeling confident, even
if he's played in just one game
for the sixth-ranked Wolverines.
His second-period marker during
Michigan's 6-3 win over Bentley
at Yost Ice Arena on Friday night
came after he was scratched from
the first two games of the season.
"It was an unbelievable expe-
rience," said Copp, who had his
family in attendance forthe mile-
stone. "The atmosphere at Yost is
nothing like in junior hockey."
The Ann Arbor native read-
ily admits that there's a "learning
curve" involved in transitioning
from the United States National
Team Development Program's
under-18 team to college hockey.
He's already noticed how much
stronger the skaters are, for one.
And that learning curve is steep-
ened because Copp missed half of
last season in the United States
Hockey League with a broken
collarbone, suffered while play-
ing quarterback for Skyline High
School.
But, as Friday's goal showed,
the adjustment is coming, thanks
in part to two players not far
removed from their freshmen
campaigns. Both Copp and fresh-
man linemate Justin Selman
acknowledged what a good role
model sophomore forward Zach
Hyman has been. Copp noted
that Hyman took his scratch
in the finale against Rochester
Institute of Technology in stride
and didn't let it change his work,
ethic.
The line of Hyman, Copp and
Selman has "really given our
team a life," according to Michi-

gan coach Red Berenson.
"He told us what we needed to
do to have a good week in prac-
tice," Selman said. "He was mak-
ing sure every day we were going
as hard as we could. We kind of
worked off what he was doing
and followed in his footsteps.
Copp also pointed out that
junior defenseman Jon Merrill
has gone out of his way to make
the freshmen feel welcome,
despite cracking a vertebrae dur-
ing an exhibition game.
Selman and Copp didn't
always mesh together as well as
they have the past two weeks,
when they've each set the other
up for a goal. In fact, in the past,
neither enjoyed playing against
the other while they were both in
the USHL.
"Growing up, I hated playing
against (Selman)," Copp said.
"We had a little bitof a rivalry but
now we play together real well."
Added Selman: "We comple-

ment each other really well. We
have a similar game. We work
hard in both ends. It's real fun
playing with Copper."
Last season, then-freshmen
forwards Alex Guptill and Phil Di
Giuseppe stepped into the stop-
light, with the former earning
CCHA Rookie of the Year honors
and the latter scoring in bunches
early.
"Especially in a program like
this, guys can have an opportu-
nity right away if you take what
they give you and make the most
of it," Selman said.
It's difficult to count on consis-
tent scoring from freshmen, but
the opportunity is there for Copp
and Selman to produce this sea-
son. Berenson likes them skating
together onthe youthful line.
"I like the way they're play-
ing," Berenson said of the two
freshmen. "I like their enthusi-
asm. They got their chance, and I
think they played well."
