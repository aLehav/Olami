Whether sitting with
100,000 other Michigan fans
or in the comfort of their own
living rooms, prospective vic-
tors watching Saturday's game
against Notre Dame have some
new commercials headed their

way.
After a year of brand research
and an additional year of pro-
duction, commercials featuring
students and scenes from across
campus were shot by the Uni-
versity's marketing team, with
the primary intention of attract-
ing prospective students to the
University.
The advertisements airing
Saturday cost $600,000 to pro-
duce, while the entire campaign,
which will be completed by
advertising agency Lowe Camp-
bell Ewald, also includes several

more expansive videos, web fea-
tures and other marketing mate-
rials, cost $1.1 million.
Matt Schlientz, the Univer-
sity's director of marketing, said
that the 30- and 60-second video
spots were created through the
collaboration of all the major
units on campus, ranging from
the Athletic Department to the
University of Michigan Health
System.
"It's a unique time in Michi-
gan's history where we have all
of these units, schools and col-
leges and departments coming

together," Schlientz said.
For its newest batch of
recruitment advertisements, the
University formed the Execu-
tive Marketing Council in the
winter of 2011. The council
includes heads from depart-
ments and units across campus
and was "intimately involved in
the production process."
The videos feature University
students in some of the better-
known locations on campus.

M-TRACS to split

By CHRISTY SONG
Daily Staff Reporter
The University is launching a new pro-
gram in the hopes of putting the future of
transportation on the right "TRAC."
The new initiative, Michigan Transla-
tional Research and Commercialization,
works to advance the future of transpor-
tation technologies and boost Michigan's
economy.
M-TRAC is a three-year program cre-
ated to fund researchers from the College
of Engineering and the U-M Transporta-
tion Research Institute to innovate trans-
portation.
Volker Sick, the University's associ-
ate vice president for research and an
M-TRAC oversight committee member,
said the program was developed as a result
of a public announcement made late last
year by the Michigan Economic Develop-
ment Corporation. The organization invit-
ed universities within the state to compete
in finding a project that would enhance
current transportation technologies.

Presidents of Congo and
Rwanda call for peace talks

Hope for dialouge
between rebels and
government renew
JOHANNESBURG (AP) -
The presidents of Congo and
Rwanda on Thursday called for
peace talks to quickly resume
between the Congolese gov-
ernment and a rebel movement
that is widely believed to be
backed by Rwanda.
The summit organized in
Uganda's capital marked a rare
opportunity for Congolese Presi-
dent Joseph Kabilaand Rwandan
President Paul Kagame to hold
face-to-face meetings at a time
when their countries are on edge
over Rwanda's alleged military
involvement in eastern Congo.
The negotiations between
the Congolese government and
the M23 rebels have repeatedly
stalled since late last year.
In a statement issued late
Thursday, the presidents and
other regionalleaders called for
peace talks to resume within
three days' time "and conclude
within a maximum periodof14
days during which maximum
restraint must be exercised on
the ground to allow for talks to

conclude."
In August, Congolese troops
backed by U.N. forces battled
M23 rebels near the eastern
city of Goma, home to nearly 1
million people along the Rwan-
dan border. Rwanda accused
the Congolese military of firing
missiles across the border and
warned that "this provocation
can no longer be tolerated."
Then the M23 rebels last
week declared a unilateral
cease-fire following a week of
heavy fighting with the Congo-
lese troops, saying they want-
ed to "give peace a chance,"
although Congo's government
said it wants M23 disbanded.
Congo's government now
will be less keen on the talks as
its army and a newly strength-
ened U.N. intervention force
appear to have the upper hand
in the most recent clashes with
the rebels, according to Jason
Stearns, a Congo expert who
runs the Usalama Project, a
think tank that researches
Congo's armed groups.
"The primary drive to get
back to the negotiating table
is coming from Uganda and
Rwanda," he said. "They (Con-
go's government) feel that they
are in a position of strength."

Congo's government would
be interested in talks that can
lead to "the decapitation of
M23," he added.
Thursday's meeting in the
Ugandan capital of Kampala
was called by Ugandan Presi-
dent Yoweri Museveni "to stop
the fighting and get beck on the
negotiating table," according
to James Mugume, the perma-
nent secretary at Uganda's For-
eign Ministry.
The summit in Kampala was
organized under the banner of
a regional bloc called the Inter-
national Conference on the
Great Lakes Region. It also was
attended by United Nations spe-
cial envoy Mary Robinson, who
has urged a political solution to
a crisis that recently threatened
to spill over Congo's borders.
In their statement Thursday,
the presidents said they "strong-
ly condemn" the deaths of civil-
ians on both sides of the border
and also urged M23 to stop its
threats.
"M23 should put an end to
all military activities, and stop
war and threats of overthrow-
ing the lawful government
of (Congo)," said the state-
ment signed by the presidents
including Rwanda's Kagame.

An award-winning novelist

lost his fall teaching assignments
at Michigan State University after
acknowledging the remarks were
offensive, the school said Thurs-
day.
William Penn, whose writings
often focus on his American Indi-
an heritage, welcomed his stu-
dents last week with an attack on
Republicans as cheap, greedy and
old. His remarks were captured
on video by a student and posted
online by Campus Reform, which
is affiliated with the Leadership
Institute, a conservative group
based in Arlington, Va.
Penn met with his bosses and
"acknowledged that some of his
comments were inappropriate,

Google's attorneys say their

federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit
that seeks to stop the practice.
In a federal court hearing
Thursday in San Jose, Google
argued that "all users of email
must necessarily expect that their

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of
10 individuals, is expected to be

widely seen as a precedent-setting
case for other email providers.

in 8-3 vote
SAN ANTONIO (AP) - San
Antonio's leaders on Thursday
approved anti-bias protections
for gay and transgender resi-
dents, over the disapproval of top
Texas Republicans and religious
conservatives who packed a City
Council hearing and occasion-
ally shamed supporters for com-
paringthe issue to the civil rights
movement.
The 8-3 City Council vote in
favor of the ordinance was a vic-
tory for gay rights advocates and
for Democratic Mayor Julian
Castro, a top surrogate of Presi-
dent Barack Obama. Castro has
called the ordinance overdue in
the nation's seventh-largest city,
where there is a stronger current
of traditionalism and conserva-
tism than other major Texas cit-
ies that already have similar gay
rights protections.
San Antonio joins nearly 180
other U.S. cities that have non-
discrimination ordinances that
prohibit bias based on sexual
orientation or gender identity,
according to the Human Rights
Campaign.

the shouts of protesters outside

100 people signed up Thursday

because there's an asterisk that

22 wounded in first
bomb attack since
Morsi's departure
CAIRO (AP) -Egypt's interior
minister narrowly escaped assas-
sination Thursday when a car
bomb tore through his convoy,
wounding 22 people and leaving
a major Cairo boulevard strewn
with debris - the first such
attack since the military ousted
the country's Islamist president.
The strike raised fears of a
militant campaign of revenge for
the coup and the likelihood of an
even tougher hand by authorities
against protesters demanding
Mohammed Morsi's return to
office.
The interim president com-
pared the attacktotheinsurgency
waged by Islamic militants in the
1980s and 1990s against the rule
of now-ousted autocrat Hosni
Mubarak, when militants car-
ried out numerous assassination
attempts, killing the parliament
speaker. Mubarak himself sur-
vived an assassination attempt in
1994, when militants attacked his
convoy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
That insurgency provided
Mubarak with a justification
for a nationwide state of emer-
gency, lifted only after he was
driven from power by an upris-
ing in 2011.
Since Morsi's ouster in a July3
coup, Egypt has been back under
emergency law, and police have
arrested nearly 2,000 members
of his Muslim Brotherhood and
other Islamistsupporters.
In mid-August, authorities
forcefully dispersed two pro-
Morsi sit-in camps in Cairo after
days of warnings, setting off vio-
lencethatkilledhundredsnation-
wide. The move led to retaliatory
strikes on government buildings,
police stations and churches
around the country.
Islamic hard-liners have since
stepped up attacks on security
forces in the Sinai Peninsula and
inthe south, and have increasing-
school, the athletics, the medical
areas, in English, in writing, in
history; we need those resources
for our students all over the place."
Rather than serving an honor-
ary role, Ross is already actively
serving as chair by speaking to
potential donors and connecting
alums to the University, according
to Baird.
While the University has
received a flurry oflarge donations
- what Baird calls "leadership
gifts" - from Ross, Charles Mung-
er and the Zell Family Foundation,
the campaign will likely receive
gifts of all shapes and sizes.
Judy Malcolm, senior director
of executive communications at
the Office of University Develop-
ment, said the University received
a record-setting number of gifts
that were less than $25,000 this
past year.
Malcolm could not provide
the exact numbers, but said Jerry
May, vice president for develop-
ment with the office of Univer-
sity Development, will include the
data in his presentation on the fis-
cal year at the University's Board
of Regents meeting on Sept.19.
While the Michigan Difference,
the previous capital campaign,
focused more on infrastructural

projects with a total of $3.2 billion
raised, Baird said this campaign
wouldn't need to sell the same
amount of inventory as Borders
did to stay open, noting that the
store is only 2,000 square feet
whereas the downtown Borders
was 42,000 square feet.
Hilary Gustafson, who owns
and operates the similarly
sized Literati with her husband
Michael, said the past five months
have been great for the store, as
they have developed a base of
customers that includes both foot
traffic and regulars.
"We will be here for a while,"
Gustafson said. "We can't speak to
the long term, as it only has been
five months, but we will be here
for at least the next year if this
continues the way it does."
Gustafson, who advised the
Blackshears on the book market
in Ann Arbor before they signed a

ly brought attacks to the capital.
Still, Thursday's bombing
against Mohammed Ibrahim,
who heads the police force wag-
ing the crackdown, was a sub-
stantial escalation. There was no
immediate claim of responsibil-
ity.
Interim President Adly Man-
sour's office vowed it would "not
allow the terrorism the Egyptian
people crushed in the 1980s and
90s to raise its ugly head again."
Military leader Abdel-Fattah el-
Sissi, the man who ousted Morsi,
pledged to continue the fight
againstterrorism.
Egyptian mediahave for weeks
vilified the protesters, blaming
the violence on Morsi's support-
ers and a terrorism campaign.
After Thursday's attack, state
media urged citizens to exercise
caution, report suspicious activi-
ties or individuals, and called on
authorities to widen their crack-
down on suspected terrorists.
The attack is likely to further
isolate the Islamists. Liberal poli-
tician Amr Moussa called on the
ousted president's backers tontake
a clear position against the bomb-
ing.
"When lives of innocents are
targeted, those who support that
or justify it will not be accepted
amongus," said Moussa, who sits
on a newly appointed constitu-
tional panel.
Morsi's supporters sought to
distance themselves from the
attack.
The Anti-Coup Coalition, a
group of Islamist factions that
has spearheaded protests since
Morsi's ouster; predicted it would
be used asa pretext for widening
the crackdown on its opponents.
"The coalition is against any
violent act, even if it is against
those who committed crimes
against the people," the group
said. "It expects that such inci-
dents will be used to extend
the state of emergency and to
increase the use of oppression,
repression and detention which
have been used by the coup
authority."
team will ensure that donors
knowthesignificance of their gifts
going toward financial aid rather
than physical enhancements to
the campus.
"Donors give where their pas-
sions are," Baird said. "I think our
donors understand the challenges
our students have in terms of pay-
ing for their education. We're
going to see a tremendous amount
support for students tocome."
In an interview Wednesday,
Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said philanthro-
py has allowed the University to
grow. Slottow said that providing
financial aid to every in-state stu-
dent who is in need - and work-
ing toward offering the same to
out-of-state students - will allow
the University to develop its
diversity.
"We went all the way to the
Supreme Court to fight for affir-
mative action and diversity, and
we studied and proved that diver-
sity prepares students more for
successful lives," Slottow said.
"So, that's avery important thing."
More details about the cam-
paign will be released at the
kickoff on Nov. 8. The Office of
University Development plans to

"The book market is really hard,
but Ithink Bookbound did it rightby

"They are fitting a niche by selling
bargain books as well as doing the

She advised Bookbound to

Unfair and under-regulated
The University needs to take initiative toward unpaid internships
Jn June, a federal district judge in New York ruled that Fox
Searchlight Pictures violated minimum wage law and overtime
laws by treating unpaid interns as regular employees on the set
of the 2010 film "Black Swan." The case, along with many others, has
shed light on the world of unpaid internships. Students are among the
most vocal against the practice as many have been victim to injustices
of these supposed mentorship opportunities. This recent movement
brings to mind the University's role in helping its students secure sum-
mer internships. The University's Career Center and internship pro-
grams, such as the Public Service Internship Program and Semester in
Detroit, are great resources for students to find internships. However,
the University could do more for students financially by fundraising
specifically for internship programs and working with other universi-
ties to provide reduced-rate housing. Furthermore, the Career Center
should review the types of internships it posts to ensure that they are
in fact mentorships if unpaid, not free labor, and create black lists of
companies who abuse the positions.

Bradley Manning, the U.S.
soldier praised as a whistle-
blower by some and con-
demned asa
traitor by oth-
ers, identifies
as a woman.
She wishes to
be called Chel-
sea Manning,
would like to
be referred to KATIE
with the femi- STEEN
nine pronoun
and would like
to begin hormone therapy. As Man-
ning put it, "I was born trans. I am a
woman from birth but because I was
born with a penis I was labeled a
man. What we do choose is when to
come out, not what our gender is."
So there it is - she said, "I am a
woman.' Seems simple enough. See
how I didn't say, "He stated, 'I am
a woman?' " No, of course I didn't,
because to do so would invalidate
Manning's explicit request to be
acknowledged as a woman.
To do so would essentially say,
but, yeah - you're not really a
woman. To do so would roll my
eyes at not just Manning but the
identity of all transgender people.
To do so would be essentially call-
ing Manning delusional -I don't
care if you think you're a woman,
you have a penis, damn it! This is
the same kind of mentality that
results in reactions to Manning's
statement like, "He's crazy" or
a "He's a tranny!" It's the same
mentality that keeps gender-
identity disorder in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders - that essentially tells

transgender people, "You have a
disorder that can be treated," just
like how we can all pray the gay
away, right, guys? (Homosexuality
was once in the DSM as well.)
And yet, transphobic mentalities
continue. I'm not just talking about
comments and tweets and whatever
other mediums the peanut gal-
lery uses to spew ignorant, hateful
remarks. I'm referring to articles
pertainingto Manning's transgen-
der identity that continue to refer to
her as "him." Even articles that spe-
cifically address the media's failure
to comply with Manning's request
to be referred to with feminine pro-
nouns do exactly that. They literally
do exactly what Manning requested
they not do, effectively undermin-
ing Manning's authority on her own
gender and identity. It's patronizing,
disrespectful and, apparently, cor-
rect, according to the Associated
Press Stylebook.
Yes, the AP Stylebook, the holy
book of journalistic style, states
that reporters should, "Use the
pronoun preferred by individuals
who have acquired the physical
characteristics of the opposite sex
or present themselves in a way that
does not correspond with their
sex at birth." In other words, the
identity of a transgender person is
apparently not valid to a reporter
until he or she undergoes surgery
or hormone replacement Therapy.
It's almost as if the AP Stylebook
is trying to call a bluff - like, oh
yeah, if you're so trans, where's
your sex reassignment surgery,
huh? It's insulting - not to mention
that it's not always convenient or
within someone's financial means

to get surgery just because of some
outdated stylebook. The gender of
a trans person is not validated by
a surgeon's knife; it's validated by
the individual.
The gender of a
trans person is
not validated by a
surgeon's knife.
And don't even get me started on
the need for trans people to "pres-
ent themselves in a way that does
not correspond with their sex at
birth." What the hell does that even
mean? I don't bake cupcakes when
I'm stressed out, I've only seen one
episode of "Girls" and I never laugh
while eatingsalad. I rarely wash
my jeans, I shower "when I feel
like it" and I sincerely like to drink
beer. I'm not the most "lady-like"
lady, so does that qualify me to be a
transgender man? Seriously, the idea
that trans people necessarily need
to "present" themselves as a certain
gender not only reinforces baseless
gender stereotypes, it's a vague and
absurd requirement.
You don't have to be a reporter
to support, or at the very least
respect, transgender rights. The
mere act of usingthe appropriate
language to address Manning and
any trans person sets an example
of how to respect a human being.

Two successful internship programs pro-
moted by the University are Semester in
Detroit and the Public Service Internship
Program in Washington D.C. While both
programs offer financial aid, their support is
limited. Semester in Detroit mandates that
all participants reside in Wayne State Univer-
sity residence halls, meaning students must
pay the steep rates and fees. Both programs
award need-based financial aid to students
who qualify through the University's Office
of Financial Aid. However, this award process
doesn't take into consideration students who
may not receive much financial aid and must
maintain continuous employment in order
to remain financially stable. The University
should expand financial aid to students con-
sidering unpaid internships especially in
areas where unpaid is the norm.
Reports of abuse stemming from unpaid
internships are on the rise. Since the ruling
of the case against Fox, more than 20 law-
suits have been filed against major companies

for their abuse of unpaid interns. The rights
of these unpaid interns who are being taken
advantage of by large corporations need to be
protected. In order for an unpaid internship to
be considered legal under the Fair Labor Stan-
dards Act, the intern must be provided an edu-
cational experience in the workplace and the
company must not gain an immediate advan-
tage from the intern. The University can help
ensure these requirements are met by review-
ing and scrutinizing the companies the Career
Center posts on its internship website or are
actively recruiting on campus. This would pro-
mote positive mentorship experiences for its
students and reward companies who provide
actual educational internship programs.
Internships play an important partin secur-
ing a job after college. Students who can afford
to will continue to apply for unpaid intern-
ships and companies will still offer them. It's
up to universities like Michigan to acknowl-
edge the reality of this situation and advocate
for their students.

A billionaire real estate developer has given $200 million to
the University of Michigan - with the mandate that all of
the money goes to the business school and the athletic de-
partment. Congrats on some shitty philanthropy, asshole."

Moneynot well spent

Dear Mr. Ross,
The University announced on Wednesday
that you donated $200 million - the largest
single gift in the history of the school. Asa fel-
low alum of the University, I want to thank you
for your donation to our alma mater, but with
reservations.
As reported by The Michigan Daily, your
gift allocates $100 million to the Athletic
Department and $100 million to the business
school. While the gift is commendable, I ques-
tion if it will best serve the University's com-
munity with its current recipients.
The Athletic Department already has $386
million in net assets and a $64 million endow-
ment. Dave Brandon, the University's athletic
director, presented a budget in June expecting
$8.9 million in profit this year. Anyone who
has attended a game at Michigan Stadium,
the Crisler Center or Yost Ice Arena knows
that our stadiums are the best in the country.
Additionally, the athletic campus has grown
immensely over the last few years, and our
resources for fostering student athletes are
second to none. The Ross School of Business
is the premier business school in the country.
Neither department needs your money to con-
tinue their success.
As University President Mary Sue Coleman
said in her 2002 inaugural address, "The glory
of the University of Michigan resides in its
abilityto re-invent itself continually, to cherish
its roots while inventing the future." Donated
elsewhere, $200 million has the ability to do
just that. And I've come up with some alterna-
tive, transformative ideas for your donation.

The money could go toward scholarships for
underprivileged and underrepresented groups.
We should continue to commit to diversity on
campus and give as broad a range of individu-
als as possible access to the University.
We should also support public service stu-
dents who may wish to serve in the military
before attending school or after graduation,
whose only deterrent may be the financial con-
sequences of attending the University.
Your donation could fund initiatives foster-
ing student research and creativity. The next
Facebook or the cure for cancer could be in the
mind of an incoming freshman. These funds
could help creative individuals make their
dreams a reality.
More social engagement programs could
be implemented within the local community.
With more than 40,000 students, the Uni-
versity can better serve the poor, sick and
disenfranchised. More funds toward these
objectives would make practical and quanti-
fiable improvements in many people's quality
of life.
You've said you wish for the University to
be a world-class institution and to train our
students for leadership opportunities in their
futures. Former University President James
Angell once remarked, "...every appropria-
tion to the University sows seeds in the most
fruitful of all soils." I hope that you use your
success for the good of the greater University
community so it can continue to be the school
that we love.
Colin Keiffer is a University alum.

Walkable streets, reliable
public transporta-
tion, affordable retail,
healthy dining
and safe resi-
dential neigh-
borhoods - all
things we, as
students of the
University and
residents of
Ann Arbor, take _
for granted on a ALEXANDER
daily basis. The HFANN
city, despite
some subtle
flaws, provides
a high quality of life for the vast
majority within its borders.
The same cannot be said for
many in Detroit, the major metrop-
olis of nearly 700,000 people, less
than 50 miles east of Ann Arbor.
A declining population, hem-
orrhaging resources, high crime
rates, a struggling school system
and unemployment all culminated
in the largest municipal bankrupt-
cy in U.S. history just filed on July
18. Needless to say, Detroit could
use a helping hand right now.
And the University isn't doing
enough to help the city.
I don't mean to imply that the
University is at all responsible for
more than 60 years of progressive
decline in Detroit. Nor do I believe
that the University must raise the
banner as a champion of the city -
quite frankly, Detroit citizens and
community officials neither need
nor want that. ButI do think that
the University needs to embrace
the fact that a healthy, strong and
vibrant Detroit is as good for the
University as it is for southeast
Michigan as a whole.
I don't intend to minimize cur-
rent efforts in the city, represented
by the accomplishments of thou-
sands of students, alumni and fac-
ulty every year.
The Detroit Partnership, just one
student organization with strong
ties to the city, sends 200 students
to Detroit every week duringthe
school year to participate in vol-
unteer programs established in
every part of Detroit. Their flagship
volunteer event, Detroit Partner-

ship Day, brings 1,400 students to
Detroit to volunteer.
Semester in Detroit is another
opportunity for University students
to engage with the city. It provides
a unique opportunity for par-
ticipants to live in Detroit on the
Wayne State University campus,
attend classes and work in Detroit.
The University's Detroit Cen-
ter in Midtown houses Semester
in Detroit classrooms and also
accommodates several programs
benefiting Detroit residents from
various schools across campus.
For example, the School of Public
Health's Healthy Environments
Project researches and promotes
heart health in Detroit neighbor-
hoods, where the death rate from
cardiovascular disease is nearly
twice as high as state and national
averages. The School of Social
Work partners with the Skillman
Foundation to provide technical
assistance in implementing its
Good Neighborhoods program
in six different Detroit neighbor-
hoods. The School of Art & Design,
the Taubman College of Archi-
tecture and Urban Planning, the
Gerald R. Ford School of Public
Policy, the College of Engineering
and University of Michigan Health
System all have some presence at
the Detroit Center.
In reality, the initiatives
described here only representa
fraction of the good work being
done by the University in the city of
Detroit. But even the whole piece
remains just a beginning.
The first step toward greater
engagement involves expanding
students' knowledge of the city's
history, problems and attractions.
To that end, the University, from
top to bottom, needs to facilitate
a more prominent dialogue about
Detroit and can begin by hosting an
increased number of speakers dis-
cussingthe issues Detroit currently
faces that see national headlines
almost daily.
Just as importantly, more stu-
dents need to go to Detroit. There's
no better way to learn about the
city and all it has to offer than to
physically be there. Whether from
fear of the city's negative reputa-

tion, ignorance of its treasures or
typical student time constraints,
too few of my fellow classmates
make the trip to Detroit in their
four years. The University could
facilitate more opportunities to see
Detroit and, likewise, better adver-
tise the Detroit Center's availability
to students.
A healthy, strong and
vibrant Detroit is as good
for the University as it is
for Southeast Michigan
as a whole.
Also, as discussions with Feo-
dies Shipp III, the Detroit Center's
associate director, revealed, some
University departments are notice-
ably absent from the Detroit Center
roster. The Career Center is an
excellent resource for students on
campus and could provide profes-
sional development resources,
job-search assistance and resume
feedback to Detroit residents des-
perately in need of such services.
In May, the United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics identified Detroit's
unemployment rate to be above 16
percent - devastatingly high com-
pared to the state's near 9 percent.
The University could positively
impact the lives of many job seek-
ers by establishing a branch of the
Career Center in Detroit servicing,
in part, local Detroiters.
There are a number of other
positive changes the Univer-
sity could make that would affect
Detroit. But the most important
is the collective recognition - as
students, faculty and staff mem-
bers of the University - that even
though the University is first and
foremost a major national public
research institution, it also has
local roots. And since the Univer-
sity was founded in 1817 in Detroit
- before moving to Ann Arbor 20
years later - its roots are deepest
in Detroit.

From her bizarre, overtly sexual
music video for "We Can't Stop"
to her frenzied performance at
MTV's Video Music Awards that

She's perhaps the most divisive

and, if I had to guess, that's
exactly what she wants.
It's not like this is a new devel-

Losing my honor
at the karaoke bar

This isn't the
time to sing
something new
By JOHN BOHN
Daily Community Culture Editor
Karaoke is a strange art, no
doubt. I say no doubt because,
well, I doubt anyone would care
to argue me on the point. Who's
talking about the art of karaoke?
No one. And that's the sweetest
part.
Welcome to a performance
space with nothing to lose. Sing
the damn song you've been sing-
ing in the car and the shower.
Everyone is drunk, and they'll
forget your performance the
next day. Nothing will remain.
It's you, Dionysus and the void.
That's not entirely true.
Maybe to me, that's the true
pride and glory of karaoke. For
others, it's yet another proving
ground. Seriously, get the hell
out of here.
All right, I'll try and jot down
what I feel might possibly be a
rubric of the art of karaoke: 90
percent performance, five per-
cent singing, five percent the
people love it.
First of all, when people are
going to karaoke, they want a
laugh. If you make them cry, it's
over. You just made 100 drunk
people in a bar cry. Was "Jesus
Take the Wheel" really worth it?
The people must love it, and the
people love a good, light song and
a stellar stage presence. If you're
looking to show you're the next
great thing, I mean why? Now,
we love our aspiring Marvin
Gaye. You know the old guy I'm

talking about. That dude rules,
and he deserves more attention.
But for the most part, the people
demand a good song and some
presence. By presence, I mean
some ironically distanced silly-
time. Skill is a bunch of hokey-
pokey blah. Seriously. No one
cares.
I might be giving some bad
advice though. It's this kind of
thinking that may have led to
the day I lost all my cred. And
that's the story I'd like to tell.
Karaoke had been a long-
standing tradition among my
group of friends. From the
get-go of college, it was kara-
oke. I couldn't go to the bar at
first with the older dudes, but I
grinded my teeth at house par-
ties and Friends Karaoke on
the weekends. For a while, I
didn't have a go-to song. You
<em>need</em> a go-to song.
Then it hit me: "Centerfold" by
the J. Geils Band. My parents
loved that song. Rule of thumb:
Ifyour parents love it, the people
love it. The '70s and '80s are ripe
with the-people-love-it quality
music. The '90s too, but it seems
like (my) parents really don't
know what happened after Bob
Seger's peak in celebrity. Any-
way, I had found my identity. I
would be "Centerfold" guy.
What's messed up, though, is
that the song is pretty raunchy.
I didn't realize until after I had
sung through it a few times.
Here's the general plot: A guy
comes across an old crush in the
centerfold of a "girly magazine."
And he's torn up about it. And
that is basically it.
The rest of the song involves
him speculating about them get-
ting together, and then he buys

the magazine. I fhean, he's not
that bad of a guy. He hopes one
day to see her when her clothes
are on. Still. For someone who
has aligned themselves with
the principles of feminism, it's a
stretch.
All right, so I start taking this
song to the big leagues, which
for Ann Arbor is Circus on S.
First Street. No cover charge.
Free pool. 75-cent PBR. Kara-
oke. I keep saying this, but I'll
keep saying it until I die: That is
the kind of bar I would want to
open - if I decided that I actu-
ally don't want to become a uni-
versity professor ... who knows
these days what will happen.
OK, so my downfall. Basically,
I sang this song at Circus mul-
tiple weeks in a row. (Turns out
everyone does that. Like I said,
you need your go-to song). And
everything was going real swell.
I (actually) got compliments like
crazy (twice). Then, one week,
I wasn't feeling "Centerfold." I
wanted something new. At the
urging of friends, I did a differ-
ent song. Doesn't matter which
one. The point is I didn't know
it as well as I thought. And I
crashed real hard. In the middle,
the DJ, for reasons unknown,
turns down the volume of the
music. I can't keep up with the
words. Out of nervousness, I
try to chug the rest of my beer
before the refrain. But that was
dumb; there's no time for that.
To add insult to injury, I swal-
low it wrong and start choking.
My friend recorded all of it.
Like I said, I might be the
wrong guy to talk to. But in my
vision of karaoke, everyone is
welcome. See you next Thurs-
day!

A character study
of Skyler White

Waiting for that Xanaxto kick in...
Blanchett dazzles as

Analyzing the
divisive woman of
'Breaking Bad'
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
Note: Spoilers ahead. This arti-
cle was written before Episode
13 of Season S "To'hajiilee" was
aired.
In the center of today's cul-
ture war is a woman, a TV char-
acter whose divisiveness has
come to define the unanswered
problem of gender in show busi-
ness. Her name is Skyler White.
When the talented actress
who portrays Skyler, Anna Gunn
came to the defense of that very
"Breaking Bad" character in an
op-ed for the New York Times,
she asserted that the unequal ire
Skyler endures from the show's
fans is due to her strength and,
most importantly, to her gender.
This is the gross generalization
I wish to re-examine, but this I
write with great unease.
Among my concerns, which
include being presumptuous or
prejudiced, my gravest still is
the possibility I might strip this
issue of the gendered elements
that are very real.
The vitriol aimed at Skyler -
and now Gunn - is some of the
ugliest stuff Generation Troll
has managed yet. It's blind to
say there resides no misogyny
in those sentiments. But Gunn's
op-ed and other similarly writ-
ten pieces preclude the possibil-
ity that there are other reasons
besides sexism underlying the
bitter disdain Skyler attracts.
And so we have sanctified Sky-
ler. We have sanctified her and
established her as a feminist
figure walled off from any legiti-
mate criticism.
I'm not here to bully or to
diminish the feminist debate,
but to complicate it. I want only
to test Gunn's argument and to
re-imagine Skyler as an object
for analysis.
Many legions of fans would
in fact refute Gunn's claim that
Skyler is a woman of steely
resolve or any type of feminist
hero at all. They'd say she's help-
less, hypocritical and passive
aggressive. (Who else cringes
when she gives her husband,
Walter, the "silent treatment?")
She shares her bed with her
oppressor and cooks his dinner.
For five seasons now, she has
done nothing to turn in Walter.
* believe they loathe her for
her helplessness because they
have no empathy. They're unable
to identify with victims and they
blame Skyler for her problems.
In this way, she is more Fanny
Price than Elizabeth Bennet,
more desperate than efficacious,
more crazed than delightful
(and rightfully so).
It's now her lot in life to over-
come her victimization. She's
trapped in an abusive marriage
- in her own home - with no
way out. So how are we to expect

her to climb out of the dangerous
world Walter has imposed on his
family? Lack of empathy is the
beginning of all prejudice, but
here helplessness (some would
say willful helplessness) is the
key factor and much of that has
to do with how the story was
told.
The characters with which
the viewer empathizes rely on
the craft of storytelling, on what
function to which the character
is relegated, what the storyteller
wishes to show us of him or her.
In short, I won't empathize with
a character unless the storytell-
er gives me good reason.
We naturally identify more
with Walter as the protagonist,
who used to be the one suffer-
ing silently, not Skyler. Some-
how, they both let the other
down: They never realize just
how much they need each other.
It makes you wish that, after all
this time, Walter's first "confes-
sion" in the pilot, before he ever
had Heisenberg delusions, will
find its way back to his fam-
ily. That would be the way they
remember him. Just as sympa-
thy for Walter endures for once
being a powerless high-school
teacher, fans' hatred of Skyler
endures because of the way she
was initially framed.
Walter is a monster. He endan-
gers all his friends, his family,
all he loves. He never wanted to
hurt anyone, but his tragic flaw
- his hubris - compels him to
continue down this road. And
therein lies the difference on
which everything depends: Wal-
ter is our tragic hero. Not Skyler.
William Brennan of Slate calls
Skyler the "moral grounding" of
the story; I call her a moral irri-
tant. Personally, I have no affini-
ty for moral arbitration in stories
as these. Skyler's function in the
story as an adjudicator of values
simplifies morality in a complex
story about the thrill and trag-
edy of crime, family and pride.
Her proclivities for that time
of unshifting morality, which
now rapidly crumble, make her
Walter's natural antagonist in
more ways than gender. Truly,
it's only until she reveals the
darker depths of herself, when
she finally breaks bad, that I was
more drawn to her.
And still, however much the
need for survival has whittled
down the list of good things in
their world, there are two ideals
they have kept: family and loy-
alty - and those, too, have their
corruptions. Walter poisons a
boy, lets Jane die, manipulates
his son's adoration, nearly gets
Hank killed and more, but he
never does the unthinkable yet
really altogether logical: He's
Machiavellian, but he hasn't
killed Hank. And who knows?
He just may yet.
For the sake of argument, let's
contrast that to Skyler's infidel-
ity. Opposed to Walter's utter
devotion to family that first pro-
pelled him into the drug world
and the pride that trapped him,
Skyler's disloyalty proves to be

a big barrier for many people. I
don't want to weigh the moral-
ity of actions, to judge Skyler.
I want only to understand her
image and to understand why
Walter is not judged as harshly.
And this, as a fan, I understand
well: Loyalty is paramount to
our feelings of likeability.
Somewhere deep down - and
this has been reinforced again
and again - Walter is unable to
break some bonds. Skyler is the
love of his life. Junior is his big
man. Holly is the innocence he
wants to preserve. Hank and
Marie happened to be on the
wrong side. Jesse is the young
man he regrets having hurt and
yes, he loves him. And however
unpredictable the finale will be,
we know already it is too late for
Walt to cherish those things as
they should be cherished when
his end comes. We can only hope
Skyler and the children, Hank
and Marie, and Jesse escape his
sins.
Again, however, we come back
that fundamental principle that
guides all character analysis:
empathy. It took both Whites to
ruin their marriage. And I think
we can all agree it was Walter's
reign of terror that drove Skyler
to Ted for revenge - out of spite.
That said, we must still pon-
der further on empathy: Is it the
responsibility of the storyteller
to frame his characters in such a
way to evoke empathy and love?
Or is it the responsibility of the
viewer to read beyond the frame
of the story itself?
Much has been said about ide-
als, but nothing of superficial
dislike. Skyler has my empathy,
but not my love. Because she has
one and not the other. Because
the blogosphere has simplified
the discussion to feminist and
anti-feminist positions, whatever
reasons I have for disliking Skyler
are deemed invalid.
Gunn presents Skyler as a new
way by which we can measure
societal progression just as aca-
demics and critics use cultural
pieces to track our values and to
hold their failings accountable.
The problem is that Skyler is a
faulty measurement. I could very
well dislike her for something as
simple as her attitude.
But I can't say that. I can't say
her melodramatic displays are
repulsive, that she's spiteful and
downright obnoxious. I can't say
her steep, cutting angle of con-
descension was grating to my
ears. All that and more would
insinuate I dislike her for inhib-
iting not only Walter's but every
male's "masculine" urges. We
have simplified the discussion
rather than opened it.
My question is why she has
to likeable. Her function, how
she was written into this tale,
her trajectory from veggie-
bacon-cooking housewife to
crime affiliate and Gunn's deft
performance - that is the sin-
gular achievement that arrests
my attention. It's a fascinating
study. And really, it can be just
as simple as that.

"Blue Jasmine" is more than
just Woody Allen's latest procla-
mation to the world that at 77, he's
finally figured it all out ("In1942, I
had already discovered women.").
It's more than just a character
study of a has-been socialite torn
between denial and an ever-fad-
ing notion of absolution. More,
eventhan Cate Blanchett gesticu-
lating. At onlyslightriskofhyper-
bole, I'd go as far as saying it's
more than just a movie - it's an
unanswered question, thought up
by Allen and posed in Blanchett's
thistle-honey voice.
It is, for no lack of a better
phrase, The Shit. Most people
who've seen it have echoed simi-
larly fawning sentiments, albeit
in slightly better wording. Yet, I
find myself frustrated. Frustrated
because so much of what I've read
about the film in the month since
its release has made the exasper-
ating generalization that Jasmine
Francis is another one of Allen's
one-note characters, smugly
drawn to glimpse reality through
a pair of binoculars. Is she darker,
less neurotic? Yes, but ultimately
etched in our psyche by perhaps
the best piece of work by any actor
or actress in five years.
Don't get me wrong - I
wouldn't have seen this movie
four times had it not been for that
gargantuan performance, and
Cate Blanchett deserves all the
praise she will ever get and more
for what she's accomplished in
this film. Simply put, it's the type
of portrayal that inspires other
actors to be better, one thatwillibe
remembered years down the line
for its near-flawless examination
of mental decay.
But at the same time, it's wrong
to assume Jasmine was meant
by Allen to be a horrible person,
festering towards the madness
she's brought on her own snob-
by, perfectly coiffed head. No.
This movie is better than that. It
leaves you with something more
meaningful than the bitter after-
taste that accompanies tongue-in-
cheek simplification.
In truth, it's a refreshing
change of pace considering Allen
has erected a prolific, sto-
ried body of work around the
pervading (some would say
annoying) idea that any char-
acter, no matter how complex,
can be caricatured to occupy
unapologetically sheltered
environments: either Park
Avenue havens or wherever
the people who occupy Park
Avenue havens think the other
side lives. Here, Allen under-
scores the aloof irony of those
caricatures, and through that
isolation, gives us an engrossing
study of the complicity of weak-
ness and amorality.
The key word is complicity.
One cannot exist without the
other. Jasmine is rarely if ever
truly amoral. Think about it:

WOMEN'S SOCCER
Stakes on Pepperdine Lewis wins Big Ten
By JASONwRUBENSTEIN g U Freshman of Week
Daily Sports Writer g r - rAs or n f ~ e

The abundance of talent on
the 2013 Michigan women's soc-
cer team was evident to head
coach Greg Ryan before this sea-
son started. And though it's still
early in the season - only four
games in - Ryan is glad to see
all that talent materializing into
results.
The 11th-ranked Wolverines
remained unbeaten after dis-
mantling No. 23 San Diego State,
3-1, Sunday. The Aztecs (1-2-1)
were Michigan's highest ranked
opponent to start the year.
"We have a great balance with
a team that defends very well
and attacks really well," Ryan
said. "We have a lot of depth, and
eight of our 14 goals have been
scored by players coming off of
the bench."
Now, Michigan (4-0-0) will
look to earn its fifth straight win
when it squares off against No.
22 Pepperdine Friday.
In the preseason, Ryan rec-
ognized that certain freshmen
would contribute to the team's
success and he hasn't been dis-
appointed thus far. Freshman
Madisson Lewis' three goals are
tied with senior Nkem Ezurike
and sophomore Christina
Ordonez for most on the team.
But Lewis has scored her goals
with less playing time coming off
the bench.
Lewis has been critical in
drawing defenders away from
Ezurike, who is on pace to be
Michigan's all-time leading goal
scorer. Lewis' efforts led her to
be named the Big Ten Freshman
of the Week.
"(Lewis) is a very gifted ath-
lete," Ryan said. "She is excep-
tionally fast, and any ball that is
played behind the defense, she
has the pace to get to. Some of
her goals have been very high-
level finishes and she is putting
her whole game together."

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 11 Michigan wom-
en's soccer team broke open
the 2013 season with a flurry of
goals, thanks to outbursts from
freshman forward Madisson
Lewis and her fellow under-
classmen.
In the first four games of the
year, Lewis netted three goals
and two assists, which led to
her first Big Ten Freshman of
the Week award.
"It was totally out of the
blue," Lewis said.
But Michigan coach Greg
Ryan said that superb play by
underclassmen players includ-
ing Lewis, freshmen forward
Nicky Waldeck, freshmen for-
ward Anna Soccorsi and soph-
omore midfielder Christina
Ordonez is no surprise.
"We really saw it before,"
Ryan said. "We knew that we
would have so much talent and
so much depth, and that the
freshman class was going to be
very, very talented."
Lewis attributed her early
season success to the experi-
ence of her teammates.
"To play with those kind of
players that we have, it makes
it really easy for me to jell with
them," Lewis said. "They give a
lot of direction on the field."
The work ethic and skill
Lewis brings to the field is what
Ryan said sets her apart. A track
athlete in high school with dev-
astating finishing touch, Lewis'
hustle and speed off the bench
have allowed her to put the ball
in the back of the net so effec-
tively this season.
"Madi's a tireless worker,
she's constantly moving," Ryan
said. "She's got so much pace
that she just blows the doors
off of most players. Most teams

aren't used to seeing a player
that has that kind of pace."
Lewis, a former Plymouth
High School standout and two-
time Gatorade State Player of
the Year, said the atmosphere of
collegiate soccer appeals to her.
"We're all on the same page
with our goals," Lewis said.
"For high school, it wasn't real-
ly like that because people were
playing for different club teams.
"This team, we have similar
goals and we all want to go to
the same place."
Though Lewis has made her
impact coming off the bench as
a reserve in this early part of
the season, Ryan said that could
change.
"We have started with four
veterans," Ryan said. "That's
been a good formula for us, but
now the young kids are going
to win more and more playing
time if they continue to be as
productive as they are.
"Don't be surprised to see
them in the starting lineup,
rather than coming off the
bench, if we think that they can
help us to do better right from
the very beginning."
The Wolverines play No. 22
Pepperdine, a talented team
fresh off a road win at No. 19
Texas A&M, at home Friday.
Ryan said the game will test his
team.
"We've been preparing for
Pepperdine all week," Ryan
said. "We know we're going to
have a great challenge in front
of us (Friday)."
Lewis, who put the clinch-
ing goal away against No. 21
San Diego State last weekend,
seemed unfazed.
"We think we're pretty pre-
pared," Louis said. "That's our
main goal ... to keep a high pres-
sure on the other team and to
attack."

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Sophomore midfielder Christina Ordonez is tied for the team lead in goals with three early on in the season.

Ezurike and Lewis will look
to continue their scoring ways
against Pepperdine. The Waves
are coming off a 3-1 road win
over No. 19 Texas A&M.
"They're an outstanding team
that has no problems playing on
the road," Ryan said. "I think
they are much better than their
ranking. They have one of the
best forwards in the country."
Lynn Williams, the reigning
National Soccer Coaches Asso-
ciation of America Player of the
Week, scored two goals in two
minutes against the Aggies to
secure the win.
"You can't stop her with one
player; you have to play great
team defense," Ryan said. "It is
going to take a great team effort
to stop Lynn Williams from
scoring. She will be a challenge

for us, but it is one we're excited
about."
One of the biggest story-
lines before Friday's match is
the return of junior midfielder
Christina Murillo who repre-
sented Mexico in Tuesday's
international friendly against
the United States. Though Mex-
ico lost 7-0, the junior had the
opportunity to face international
superstars such as Abby Wam-
bach and Alex Morgan.
"I am really excited for
(Murillo)," Ryan said. "We were
able to get through the weekend
without her, but it wasn't easy.
We definitely missed her, but if
you want to have national play-
ers on your team, you have to let
them represent their country."
Michigan won both of its
games in Murillo's absences,

though Ryan knows her impor-
tance as she will be looked to
anchor an already solid midfield.
Perhaps Murillo's best skill is her
ability to help the Wolverines
control possession.
"She is one the most talented
players on the team," Ryan said.
"She's a very good possession
player with great skills. She
serves a fantastic ball on our set
plays and defends very well and
helps us build our offense."
Pepperdine might give the
Wolverines their biggest test
of the season to date, but Ryan
knows his squad can counter.
"They are a very dynamic and
skillful team that's talented in all
facets of the game," Ryan said.
"It's going to be a huge challenge
for us against a very talented
team."

f~

hat to Watch for: otre Dame
By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
How does Devin Gardner handle
a front seven that can actually deliv-
er pressure?
Tuesday, offensive coordinator
Al Borges said that Notre Dame's
defensive line is as good as any
Michigan will see. He didn't say the
same thing about Central Michi-
gan.
Gardner looked good against
the Chippewas last weekend, both
through the air and on the ground.
But the majority of his 52 rushing
yards came on scrambles, which
isn't going to be easy against the
Fighting Irish's defensive line. The
unit is one of the biggest and best
in the country, and running lanes
aren't going to be as wide open as
they were last Saturday.
In terms of the passing game,
Gardner is going to feel a lot more
pressure in the pocket against
Notre Dame. He blamed one of his
two interceptions against Central
Michigan on being hit while he
threw, which is going to happen
often against the Fighting Irish.
The pressure will be there - it's
just a matter of how the-redshirt
junior quarterback responds.
On a SportsCenter clip earlier
this week, Gardner said, "If I pro-
tect the football, the defense is
going to stop them, we're going to
score and we're going to win." He
might be right.

How will Michigan's inexperi-
enced interior offensive line do
under the lights?
That front seven will also affect
Michigan's interior line. Before last
Saturday against Central Michi-
gan, the group - redshirt freshman
Kyle Kalis and redshirt sophomores
Jack Miller and Graham Glasgow
- had zero combined career starts.
The trio didn't make any major
mistakes and played well for the
most part, especially Kalis, who
made highlights with a body-slam
pancake block during a passing
play.
You can bet that Kalis, Miller
and Glasgow are going to have a
lot more trouble delivering those
crushing blocks Saturday. Two
monsters, tackle Louis Nix III and
end Stephon Tuitt, highlight Notre
Dame's defensive line.
Nix is 6-foot-2 and weighs more
than 340 pounds, while Tuitt is
about 6-foot-6. Both linemen have

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Fith-year senior offensive tackle Taylor Lewan will have a big challenge on his hands Saturday against Notre Dame's massive and talented defensive line.

great quickness for players of their
size - so protecting Gardner and
getting the running game going
will be a task.
Fifth-year senior tackle Taylor
Lewan will probably be matched up
with Tuitt for most of the night, but
Nix is going to be the responsibility
of the young interior linemen. It's a
big test for them early in the season.
How does Derrick Green do as
the backup running back?
The first depth chart of the year
had six running backs listed, all of
whom were in serious contentionto
get carries behind the starter, fifth-
year senior Fitzgerald Toussaint.
That list got one man shorter,

though, when primary backup
Drake Johnson suffered an ante-
rior cruciate ligament injury on a
special-teams play last Saturday.
The redshirt freshman is out for
the year.
Wednesday, Hoke said that
freshman Derrick Green is going
to be the primary backup on Satur-
day behind Toussaint. Green still
looks to be a little bit larger than
the Michigan coaching staff wants
him to be, but he showed flashes
last weekend of why he was the
No. 1 running back recruit in the
nation. He finished the game with
a team-high 58 yards on 11 carries
and scored a touchdown.
He also didn't play until the
third quarter, when the game was

well out of reach. The pressure will
be different if he has to play while
the score is actually close.
"Didn't make a lot of bad running
decisions," Borges said Tuesday.
"Ran the ball pretty much where
we wanted him to. So he grew a
little bit. I don't know if that means
anything, but he grew a little bit
with those carries."
Does the students' energy hold
throughout the whole night?
Two years ago, the crowd was
loud from kickoff until well after
the game had ended, to the point
where the public-address announc-
er had to ask fans to leave. For a
variety of reasons, this year might

be a little different.
In 2011, with no general-admis-
sion policy, students could get to
the game whenever they wanted.
OnSaturday,thegeneral-admission
student lines open at 11 a.m., mean-
ing students could potentially be at
the Big House for 13 hours on Sat-
urday. Will the energy still be there
after all day in the sun, waiting for
the game? Will it be sustained?
There was a certain mystique in
2011. It was the first night game at
Michigan Stadium, and from the
get-go,the game just felt like a com-
pletely different experience than
any other game in the Big House.
Saturday is the second night
game in Ann Arbor. Is the charm
and mystique still there?

Saturday against Notre Dame. The game is usually a measuring

Michigan students who expected to have seat assignments before the season were disappointed in the new general admission policy.

to get people to understand
how important this was."
The Athletic Department
declined comment for this
story.
To Brandon's credit,
the Daily's analysis shows,
assigned-seating policies
across the nation seem
endangered. Michigan was
the last school in the Big
Ten to use a pure assigned-
seating policy, and just eight
out of 129 schools - none in
the Big Ten - currently use
an assigned-seating poli-
cy. Twelve other schools
employ a hybrid model, par-
tially using assigned seat-.
ing. Wisconsin, for example,
has a general-admission
policy for each section,
but allows students to pre-
select a section so they can
sit with friends.
Brandon named Nebras-
ka, specifically, as a school
the department researched.
Nebraska switched to gen-
eral-admission in 2008,
with one tweak: students
are assigned to sections of
the stadium, and seniors get

to select a section first.
"It gives upperclass-
men priority in their seat-
ing location, and allows
students the freedom to sit
with large groups of friends
at our games," said Keith
Mann, Nebraska's assistant
athletic director for media
relations.
Mann said the policy
has improved attendance
and involvement. Michi-
gan made no such tweaks,
though Proppe had lobbied
for the policy to grandfather
in upperclassmen.
Plus, some wondered
whether the general-admis-
sion policy would actually
solve the attendance issue.
"General admission may
do that, but it is not guar-
anteed to do that," said Dr.
Nod Fort, a professor of
Sport Management at the
University and co-director
of the Michigan Center for
Sport Management. "I have
seen other stadiums where
general admission leads
to 'reservation protection'
behavior. For example, a

campus social group may
simply send four of their
people in early - or in line
- and then require that they
save two blocks of seats."
By 2:07 p.m. before the
Central Michigan game,
though, the department had
handed out all of its wrist-
bands for early-arrivers. To
improve the student expe-
rience and avoid a situation
like Atlanta, the Athletic
Department reached out to
Proppe and others. Chief
Marketing Officer Hunter
Lochmann personally deliv-
ered pizza. There was water
and toilets. TVs showed
College GameDay and disk
jockey's played music. By
the 3:37 kickoff, the student
section was full.
Some upperclassmen
nonetheless expressed
frustration with the policy.
which no longer guaran-
tees them the best seats.
In the first CSG meeting of
the school year, Proppe said
that the resolution - calling
for more student involve-
ment in Athletic Depart-

ment decisions that affect
students - had worked.
"(The Athletic Depart-
ment) got some bad press on
it and now they are turning
it around," Proppe said.
But that's only partially
true. The Athletic Depart-
ment will send representa-
tives to the Sept. 17 CSG
meeting. Proppe said they
assured him students will
be advised on future ticket-
ing issues. But for now, the
football policy seems to be
set in stone.
Before Proppe spoke at
the May Regent's Meeting,
he received an 8 a.m. phone
call from Brandon.
"I think he definitely
understood there was nega-
tive reaction from the stu-
dents and so he, I would
speculate, he wanted to
get buy-in from students,"
Proppe said of the 30-min-
ute call.
Brandon said he under-
stood the complaints,
according to Proppe, but the
decision had already been
made.

Know a student
One alumni said that even though he graduated, he
still knows a few current students and used them to buy
season tickets this year. It's technically against the rules,
but getting a current student to buy you season tickets is
by far and away the cheapest way to get tickets, even if
you only go to a couple games. Technically, your M-Card
will expire anywhere from a year to five years after you
graduate depending on whether you get a new one issued,
but the ushers never check dates and you don't have to
scan anything to get in.
Join the football Saturdays program
through the Alumni Association
If you are too far out of school to pass as a student,
the Football Saturdays program through the Alumni
Association is a great way to get cheap tickets. In the
spring, you have to fill out an application ranking the
games yourwant to go to. Your name is then entered in
a lottery for the games you marked. Get selected, and
you get tickets in the south end zone for face value. Some
games are harder than others to win -there were 6,000
applications for the 1,000 allotted Notre Dame tickets -
but the system is pretty straight forward and not revenue-
driven, which makes everything cheaper.
The program is free as long as you are a member of the
Alumni Association in good standing
Wait
This might be the hardest option, becauseit's basically
a gamble. The. athletic department released the tickets
on July 31, saying to buy them earlier rather than later
because ticket prices would rise the closer the event got.
For Notre Dame this week, that simply wasn't true.
In the middle of August, the cheapest dynamic pricing
ticket was $266. which is about $100 cheaper when they
were when originally released. OnMonday this week,
the cheapest tickets started at $214 on StubHub, but by
Thursday, the cheapest had dropped to around $180.
Tickets might be even cheaper than that is you wait until
after kickoff and go to scalper that is growing desperate to
unload their tickets. It's risky but could ultimately end up
being a lot less expensive than buying in advance.

Underneath the hype, game is full of emotions

w

Daily Sports Editor
Beyond the week-long
bantering between Brady
Hoke and Brian Kelly,
beyond the tradition of
the Michigan-Notre Dame
rivalry and beyond the lights
being turned on at Michigan
Stadium again, there are
only two feelings that seem
to matter to the Michigan
football players who have
faced the Fighting Irish
before.
The first was the inde-
scribable electricity of Mich-
igan Stadium before, during
and after the Wolverines'
now legendary come-from-
behind win in the first Under
the Lights game in 2011.
The second is about as
far-flung off the first as pos-
DYNAMIC

The new policy doesn't
affect anybody that has sea-
son tickets - those prices
stay the same regardless of
the game. But season tickets
aren't cheap, as mandatory
donations and personal-seat
licenses raise the price well
above the face value of the
ticket.
The fans this ticket policy
affects are people like Kara

seats to students who attend-
ed the most games, skipping
the line was rampant. And
the wait, with no televisions
to watch the early Final Four
game, created a mixture of
boredom and frustration.
Proppe said some stu-
dents equated the gen-
eral-admission policy to
Atlanta, where "there's
this perception that you're
being herded like cattle."
By the morning after the
announcement, in a Face-
book poll conducted by the
Daily with 643 responses,
77.2 percent of voters said
they hated the policy.

sible: leavingSouth Bend last
year after takinga literal and
figurative drubbing from the
Fighting Irish.
Both feelings are motiva-
tors for Michigan this week.
The players know it. The
coaches know it. It's Notre
Dame week, after all.
"It's a rivalry game to us,
that's us picking up inten-
sity," said fifth year senior
wide receiver Jeremy Gal-
lon. "The whole game of
football is changing for that
60 minutes. It's a different
level. There's more to it than
just playing football, it's
about winning it and hav-
ing the upper hand on your
opponent."
Last week against Cen-
tral Michigan provided a
relatively easy test for the
Wolverines and their new

pro-style offense. Now it's
time to see how redshirt
junior quarterback Devin
Gardner and the rest of the
Wolverines will stack up
against a team that was on
the cusp of a national cham-
pionship last year.
Gardner threw two inter-
ceptions last Saturday, and
according to offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges, one was
preventable and the other
was not.
But considering six turn-
overs against Notre Dame
proved to be Michigan's
downfall last year, the
challenge for Gardner will
be walking the fine line
between ball security and
making the necessary big
plays.
Gallon said he doesn't
mind what Gardner does,

because at the end of the day
he said he has trust in his
quarterback. For the most
part, Hoke shares those sen-
timents, but there's always
that lingering feeling of con-
cern.
"For Devin, believe me,
we started this conversa-
tion in July about how we're
going to make decisions, how
we're going to take care of
the football," Hoke said. "I'd
rather have a quarterback
like Devin that you have to
pull back a little bit than I
would a quarterback who
you have to kick in the pants
to get out there to compete."
Where nerve-wracking
might be the resound-
ing phrase Hoke uses to
describe some of Gardner's
spontaneous tendencies,
the one adjective he picks to

describe Tommy Rees, his
Notre Dame counterpart, is
"accurate."
And when it comes to
the Fighting Irish's defen-
sive line? Maybe the best
words to use there are huge
and experienced, especially
when considering Notre
Dame defensive tackle
Louis Nix III, who weighs
in at a hefty 342 lbs. With
that mind, Borges is putting
even more pressure on the
offensive line to take care of
Gardner and prevent a 2012
repeat.
"(Former quarterback)
Denard (Robinson) took a
lot of physical and figurative
hits in (last year's) game,"
Borges said. "A lot of those
balls he got intercepted, he
was hit on, which tells us
we need to take care of our

quarterback so he can see
the throws."
Saturday will be the last
Michigan-Notre Dame game
in Ann Arbor for the foresee-
able future. But amidst all
the glitz and glam of the all-
day festivities and the lights
turning on, the game is, first
and foremost, a measuring
stick.
"I think (Michigan-
Notre Dame) was always a
game that really (gave) you
a little bit of a true north of
what kind of football team
you're going to have," Hoke
said. "You've got two tradi-
tional national powers play-
ing each other. I remember
coach Schembechler all the
time talking about, how that
game, you kind of get an
idea of where you were as a
team."

Breakdown:
Notre Dame
at Michigan


Jasina, a 2012 alumni who is
in graduate school at Wayne
State for social work. She
lives close, but can't afford
season tickets and wouldn't
be able to afford single-
game tickets with the new
policy. Her plan was to tail-
gate in Ann Arbor and watch
the game on TV before she
won the right to buy tickets
in a lottery run by the Foot-
ball Saturdays program in
the Alumni Association (see
chart). Without that lottery,
she wouldn't have been able
to go to the game.

The ticket policy affects
people like the engineer
who works for one of the
automotive companies in
the area and who gradu-
ated last year but is using
student tickets again this
year. He requested his name
be withheld because of his
unauthorized use of student
tickets. He couldn't afford
season tickets, and through
a loophole in the system, got
student tickets again this
year (see chart). After his
remaining friends still in
school graduate, he won't be

able to afford season tickets
anymore and will have to
scalp them.
Most of all, it affects
people like Bonges, who
has younger children and
lives in Chicago. Every year,
he goes to one Michigan
game with his college bud-
dies. This year, it will be
Notre Dame. He won tickets
through the lottery, but two
of his friends didn't. They
couldn't afford the single-
game ticket, and are going
to scalp beforethe game.
Again, tickets were going

to be expensive anyway.
Either the Athletic Depart-
ment makes the money or
the secondary marketplace
does.
Feldman, the economics
professor, compared it to
concert tickets.
"Musicians set their tick-
et prices really low because
they want their base fans to
be able to afford it, but they
know a lot of those tick-
ets are going to be bought
up by a lot of people who
intend to re-sell them,"
she said. "Because they

don't want to turn off their
fans, the performers don't
want to charge the $500
a ticket for their concerts.
What's happening is that
the alumni are saying, 'Is
a football game more like a
Bruce Springsteen concert,
or is it more like buying an
airplane seat.' The alumni
reaction is saying that it's
more like a concert ticket,
where you want to make it
affordable for everybody."
At what point does it
become too much for just a
football game?

One more time we go, into the
dark, looking out on the lights, the
Victors and the Irish. Michigan and
Notre Dame.
The ghosts come out at night,
under the stadium glow. Raghib
returns and Desmond dives. Denard
runs and Te'o chases. The legend of
Tate Forcier is born and disappears
again. Mike Hart takes a stand. Rick
Leach makes his speech.
Ghosts of Rockne and Yost. This
rivalry, and that's what it is, started
with hate. Fielding Yost blocked
Notre Dame from the Big Ten. Fritz
Crisler feared Michigan's Catholic
students would cheer for the Irish.
Notre Dame didn't forget.
The Irish laughed last in 2012.
Michigan didn't forget.
The ghosts won't come back
until... we don't know when. So turn
on the lights and hold your breath.
It's Michigan and Notre Dame.
Magic happens in this stadium at
night.
Michigan pass offense vs. Notre
Dame pass defense
To say the secondary is the weak
spot of the Irish defense isn't exact-
ly fair. Remember last year?
Last year, it seemed as if Michi-
gan could punish Notre Dame
through the air. The inexperienced
secondary seemed vulnerable.
But constant pressure took care
of that. The secondary proved
itself worthy last year and should
be improved in 2013 with three
returningstarters.
Cornerback Bennett Jackson is
one of four Irish players on the Bed-
narik Award watch list for the best
defensive player in the nation. His
battle with senior receiver Jeremy
Gallon is important. But pass pro-
tection will be more important.
Notre Dame's defensive line
is back, and it's just as terrifying.
Fifth-year senior left tackle Taylor
Lewan should contain All-Ameri-
can end Stephon Tuitt. Expect him
to attack the other side of the line
often.

Devin Gardner can elude rush-
ers. He'll need to. He'll also need to
improve on his blitz recognition or
more bad decisions and crippling
turnovers await.
Players to Watch: CB Bennett Jack-
son, DE Stephon Tuitt
Edge: Notre Dame
Michigan rush offense vs. Notre
Dame rush defense
Notre Dame's front seven led the
team last year. The unit was one of
the best in the nation and returns
five starters.
Manti Te'o has graduated - a
good thing for Michigan. In 2012,
Te'o harassed the Wolverines all
over the field. We'll skip the fake-
girlfriend joke because we're better
than that.
Michigan probably won't play
against an end this year better than
Tuitt, who was an All-American as
a sophomore. He'll draw two block-
ers. Likewise, Louis Nix III is the
size of two people (he's 6-foot-2,
342 pounds), and redshirt sopho-
more center Jack Miller will also
likely need additional help. That
will allow the athletic linebackers
to run more freely.
Michigan's line is inexperienced
but has potential. It's got lots of
depth at running back. Both will be
tested.

Temple, Jones hauled in six catches

"You just look up there applicants and even boosts
and see that your peers are the reputation of a Michigan
not up there supporting you degree. A rabid fan base is
in a sense," said fifth-year part of that brand.

"And in that context, the
student section is actually
essential," said Markovits,
a co-author of Sportista:
Female Fandom in the Unit-
ed States. "They would not
give it up even if they could
make a lot more money giv-
ing it to the free market, no
question."
Michigan continues to
make tickets available to
all students at the Univer-
sity. Less than half of FBS
schools, 51 total, don't put a
cap on student ticket allot-
ment. Of those, only 19 are
from one of the five major
conferences or Notre Dame.
In fact, Michigan will
make less money off stu-
dent tickets in 2013 than in
2012, even with the price

increase. The Regents' plan
to upgrade the University
recreational sports facilities
and the Union requires the
use of $1.8 million of Athletic
Department revenue. The
Athletic Department says
the entire increase in student
ticket prices will go toward
that project. With roughly
20,000 season-ticket hold-
ers, that covers about $1.05
million.
Since 2,000 fewer stu-
dents bought tickets this
season, Michigan loses about
$390,000 in revenue.
According to Dr. Mark
Nagel, a professor at South
Carolina who has researched
student fees, many schools
charge an athletics fee and
then charge for tickets.

Michigan has no such fee.
"In that regard, Michigan
does it right," Nagel said.
Assigned seating
going extinct
In an interview with
AnnArbor.com, Brandon
revealed that when Michi-
gan decided to switch to a
general-admission policy, he
felt he had no other options.
"We had Denard Rob-
inson doing appeals and
(Michigan) coach (Brady)
Hoke doing appeals," Bran-
don said, referring to the
attendance issue. "And we
were talking about it in the
student newspaper, and we
were going around campus
and we were really trying

a reputation for being turnover
prone, but he's shown improve-
ment since the game two years ago,
when his mistakes gave Michigan
the victory. He's nothing to laugh
at. Against Temple last week, he
was 16-for-23 for 346 yards with
three touchdowns and no turn-
overs. Yes, Temple was picked near
the bottom of the American Ath-
letic Conference and had numerous
breakdowns in the secondary. Still,
those numbers command respect.

more talent here.

constantly rotating front seven

George Atkinson III is the No. 1
back, and they could look to get him

For GA policy,
a costly success

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
On Nov. 16 of last year, the
Michigan Athletic Department
sent an email to students with the
subject line including: "Seriously,
Remember to Set Your Alarm." It
was a reminder for Senior Day.
In comparison to its typical
messages, filled with light-hearted
puns or practical information, this
email seemed almost agitated. The
message featured a photograph
of a sparsely populated student
section with the caption "HOME-
FIELD DISADVANTAGE."
The week before, the Wolver-
ines.beat Northwestern in a thrill-
ing overtime game, and nearly a
third of the student section never
showed up. This was becoming
an irritating trend. The Athletic
Department wanted to change that
for the following week, Senior Day
against Iowa.
But during the pregame cer-
emonies for that game, only a tiny
fraction of the student section dot-
ted the bleachers, though more
students eventually showed up.
It would be the last game under
Michigan's long-standing policy
of reserved seating, with the best
seats awarded by credit hours
accumulated. Seniors typically sat
in the front.
The Athletic Department had
tried outreach and a new loyalty
program, the HAI. application,
but nothing worked. It was ready
for a new approach.
"We did a study to find out what
other schools are charging for
student tickets, because maybe
we're too low," Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon told AnnArbor.
com in July. "Maybe one of the
reasons students aren't showing
up is because they feel like they
haven't made enough of a signifi-
cant investment in the ticket."
Analysis by The Michigan Daily,
which compiled data on student-
ticket prices and policies at all 129
FBS or soon-to-be FBS programs,
shows how far Michigan went to
correct its prices.
Coming off an 8-5 season, Mich-
igan unveiled a new pricing model
in April that, at the time, made it
the most expensive student foot-
ball ticket in the nation. The price
of a season ticket increased to $295

for seven games in 2013, includ-
ing service fees, from $205 for six
games in 2012.
For an average price of $42.14,
students get a night game against
Notre Dame, and home games
against Nebraska and Ohio State.
In August, Oregon knocked
off Michigan to become the most
expensive ticket at $360, though it
offers nearly 4,000 of its roughly
5,000-seat student section in a
game-by-game lottery for free.
The second part of the Ath-
letic Department's plan proved to
be more controversial. Reserved
seating was out. General admis-
sion seating was in. Early arrivers
would get wristbands granting
access to the first 22 rows. All oth-
ers would be assigned to a section
when they arrived.
Central Student Government
President Michael Proppe, a Busi-
ness senior, learned of the policy
change like everyone else: through
an April 23 email. The Athletic
Department, he said, hadn't con-
sulted with CSG or any other stu-
dents.
"There wasn't buy-in from the
students," Proppe said. "It was just
kind of being handed down, here's
the new policy, like it or leave it."
Within three hours of the
announcement of the new policy,
the Facebook group "UMich Stu-
dents to Reverse the New Football
Ticket Policy" had more than 1,500
'likes.' An online petition through
CSG gained more than 2,600 sig-
natures in less than 24 hours.
Students, mostly juniors and
seniors, felt cheated. They had sat
high up in Michigan Stadium, they
argued, for the chance to get to the
best rows as upperclassmen. Now
that opportunity was gone.
In response, CSG itself passed
two resolutions: one officially
opposing the general-admission
policy, and one calling for more
student input on future decisions.
Some prospective ticket-holders
had recently attended the NCAA
men's basketball Final Four in
Atlanta, where the NCAA-run
student ticketing process required
hours of queuing in a Georgia
Dome holding center. There, stu-
dents lined up five hours prior to
the game in a dark, concrete room.

Dynamic, and for some, prohibitive

AVERAGE TICKET PRICE PER CONFERENCE

By EVERETT COOK

It's July 2013. You're a couple
years out of school, old enough
to be making money but not old
enough to be making a lot of it.
Maybe you remember the 2011
Under the Lights game and want
to experience that for yourself
this year in what could be the
last Michigan-Notre Dame game
in the Big House for the foresee-
able future. You've got a group of
friends together.
There's only one problem: aver-
age tickets for Under the Lights II
are running at about $300 each.
Good seats are close to $500. The
best seats might cost you $1000.
In the past, single-game tickets
could be bought through the Ath-

letic Department for face value.
There was always high demand for
big games, but seats could be had if
you were familiar with the system.
This year would be different.
There was outrage when the
Athletic Department announced
that single-game tickets for the
2013 football season would be
using a new dynamic pricing sys-
tem, meaning that per-ticket pric-
es fluctuated depending on the
game. Groups of alumni felt like
the University was tryingto siphon
as much money as possible off the
bottom line, at the expense of for-
mer students.
But what's the better way to do
it? If the Athletic Department con-
tinues to sell tickets at face value,
they are basically giving money
away to a secondary ticket mar-

ket. In years past, people would
buy tickets from Michigan and sell
them on sites like StubHub.com or
ticketmaster.com for two or three
times more than they bought them
for.
This year, Mark Bonges, a 2004
alumnus who is on the depart-
ment's email list, got on the Ath-
letic Department's website to find
that the cheapest tickets available
cost $450. They were well out of
his price range, but tickets in the
same section were selling for a lot
more on StubHub. He bought from
the Athletic Department, think-
ing that someone in his group of
friends would want these "cheap-
er" tickets.
Nobody did.
He didn't want to scalp the tick-
ets, but still ended up making $500

on the secondary market, because
here's the problem: regardless of
whom the money is going to, right
now, there are enough people will-
ing to spend an ungodly amount of
money to go to a premium Michi-
gan football game. It's just amatter
of where the money is going.
Should the Athletic Department
try to capitalize on that?
"It makes a lot of economic
sense, but the fallout could be if
the alumni don't see it as fair and
if that affects the alum's relation-
ship with the school," said Tammy
Feldman, a University economics
professor. "Will they donate less?
Will they go to fewer games? What
does it do to the relationship with
alums? The bottom line is that
most people don't like change."
