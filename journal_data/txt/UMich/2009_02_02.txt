Officials say that
economic woes have
forced students to
return to home state
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
The University plansto alter the
wayithandlestransferapplications
this year as economic hardships
pushed some Michigan natives
attending out-of-state schools to
transfer back to their home state.
University Provost Teresa Sulli-
van said she's watching the situation
very closely to see if students from
Michigan who attend out-of-state
schools need to transfer back in-state
because of financial constraints.
"We've been hearing anecdotes
about freshmen at other universi-
ties who've been told by their par-
ents that they need to come back
in-state and go to a state univer-
sity, like Michigan," she said.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said the University does
not normally accept a large num-
ber of sophomore transfers, but
that she's willing to make excep-
tions this year. Last fall, 833 stu-
dents enrolled as transfer students
at the University, of which 32 per-
cent were sophomores.
"If there was a student who
had somehow looked at Michigan

and been admitted a year ago, but
decided to go to Dartmouth; and
now because of family circum-
stances or whatever said, 'Hey
can I come back to Michigan?' we
wanted to make sure that we were
paying attention to those stu-
dents," Coleman said.
Sullivan said students who were
previously admittedto theUniversi-
ty but chose to attend an out-of-state
school would likely be re-admitted
if they applied to transfer, though
there are no guarantees.
"Basically, if you were admit-
ted to Michigan a year ago, we feel
pretty friendlytowards you and are
notlikelyto re-think that (decision)
too carefully," she said. "It's not a
guarantee, but it's pretty routine:"
Sullivan said the tougher deci-
sions will come from students who
never applied to the University.
"I think the more difficult case
is the high school student who, for
whatever reason, did not apply to
Michigan, went out of state, now
wants to come back-and has never
applied here before," she said.
"That's a student for whom we
have to look at everything."
No official numbers have been
released yet, but Sullivan said she
has been in conversations with LSA
Dean Terrence McDonald about
how best to handle the situation.
The deadline to applyto the College
of Literature, Science and the Arts
as a transfer studentwas yesterday.

University opts
for security over
expanding coverage
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
Daily StaffReporter
Students looking to check their
Facebook updates while outdoors
are currently better off relying on
their iPhones or BlackBerrys than
their personal laptop computers.
And University officials say they
shouldn't expect that to change.
According to Andy Palms, the
University's director of IT Com-
munications, the University has

no plans to broaden the reach of its
wireless Internet network on cam-
pus, but will instead focus on mak-
ing its coverage more secure.
With nearly a quarter of the U.S.
population owning a smart phone
- like iPhones or BlackBerrys -
Palms said the University has jus-
tified its lack of outdoor coverage
with the growing prevalence of 3G
networks and similar networking
systems offered by companies like
Verizon Wireless and AT&T.
"When you're walking across the
Diag, I don't know that you need
more capacity on a truly mobile
device than what a carrier provides
you," Palms said.
A push for expanded wireless
access on college campuses has

pushed some schools like Cornell
University and Dartmouth College
to offer campus-wide WiFi access
that spans a majority of indoor and
outdoors locations.
Palms attributes the difficulty
in coordinating a comprehensive
wireless Internet system to the
University's decentralized unit
structure. He said each school
and college consults with the Uni-
versity's Information Technology
Central Services but will ultimately
judge its own IT needs.
"The units are continuing to
make their own financial deci-
sions about how they spend stu-
dent tuition dollars, whether they
spend it on (WiFi) or on faculty or
whatever their local needs are."

said Palms. "It's a very autonomous
University."
The dorms have been one area
where students are particularly
concerned with wireless reception.
Mosher-Jordan Hall and Mary
Markley Hall have been among the
few residence halls equipped with
WiFi access in both public areas and
individual rooms. The same capacity
for wireless access will be extended
to Stockwell Hall and North Quad
when they officially open their doors
in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Engineering sophomore Zach
Stoklosa lived on North Campus
last year in Baits II - one of many
residence halls lacking wireless
Internet access.

Report proposes
shortening sentences,
could save $262M
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
Michigan's state legislature
is considering a plan that would
shorten prison sentences and bring
them more in line with other states.
The plan, which is based on a year
long analysis of the state's prison
system, could provide a potential

savings of $262 million by 2015.
In a study published by the Coun-
cil of State Governments, an exami-
nation of the state's current process
of incarcerating prisoners revealed
that the average maximum sen-
tence in the state is three times as
long as the minimum, which is in
stark contrast to similar laws across
the nation.
With an approximate spending
of $32,000 per year on each individ-
ual prisoner, sentencing people for
seemingly extended periods of time
is costly and ineffective, according
to the report.

If Michigan's legislature enact-
ed the report's suggestions, 4,300
additional prisoners would be
released by 2015, which would be a
huge financial benefit for the state.
Prisoners would be reviewed by
the parole board and would not be
jailed any longer than 120 percent
of their minimum sentence.
However, the parole board would
be able to hold prisoners for more
than 120 percent of the minimum
sentence if they are deemed to be at
high-risk for re-offending.
According to the report, the

Physicists teleport information

MR. SOUTH QUAD

Quantum physicists at the Uni-
versity of Maryland successfully
teleported information between
two ions, The Diamondback report-
ed. The results of six University
of Maryland physicists' study was
published in Science magazine last
month. The feat was achieved last
September.
Researcher Steven Olmschenk
said the long gap between success and
publication was caused by the amount
of proof required forcsuch a big claim.
"We couldn't do it just once,"
Olmschenk said. "To prove we
really did it, we had to do it a few
thousand times."
The team achieved successful
teleportation 1,285 times in more
than 250 consecutive hours of lab
time.
The physicists' success opens
doors to new computing technolo-
gies. Scientists are interested inusing
charged atoms ratherthan electronic
circuits to build computers.

UNIVERSITY PLAGIARIZES
DEFINITION OF PLAGIARISM
After suffering through several
plagiarism scandals, Southern Illi-
nois University released a 17-page
report on dealing with the issue. In
the report is a definition of plagia-
rism, explaining what constitutes
plagiarism, The Chronicle of High-
er Education reported.
But that definition appears to
be plagiarized. The 139-word defi-
nition used in the report is nearly
identical'to the definition adopted
by Indiana University in 2005.
Whole passages of the 139-word
definition match verbatim. Some pas-
sages areverysimilar, buthaveslightly
different wording. For instance, Indi-
ana University's policy says: "What is
considered 'common knowledge' may
differ from course to course." South-
ern Illinois's report changes the end
of the sentence to "subject to subject."
The chairman of the committee

that put the report together, Arthur
M."Lain" Adkins, said he didn't know
of Indiana University's definition.
FIRST-YEAR STUDENT
RETENTION RATES DROP
The overall percentage of college
freshmen who return to the same col-
lege for their second year of higher
education has declined - again -
according to the results of an annual
survey released last week, The Chron-
icle of Higher Education reported.
In the lowest overall retention
rate since 1989, the study found that
66 percent of first-year college stu-
dents returned to the same school
for their second year last year.
In the 2007-2008 academic year,
about 68 percent of first year stu-
dents returned,the study, conducted
by ACT Inc., a nonprofit testing-and-
research group, found.

Granhoim urges
tuition freeze for
public universities
Aides to Gov. Jennifer Gra-

universities and community col-
leges to freeze tuition rates in her
State of the State address.
The aides tell the Detroit Free
Press in Sunday editions that
schools keeping tuition at cur-

demic year will receive some of
the money Michigan expects to
get from the federal stimulus plan
pending in Congress.
Granholm spokeswoman Liz
Boyd says the governor will ask
the Legislature to work with her
to reduce state aid for schools that
don't hold the line on tuition.
Michigan's15 public universities
raised tuition for the current school
year by an average 7 percent.
House Minority Leader Kevin
Elsenheimer, R-Kewadin, says a
tuition freeze "makes sense,"but he
expressed misgivings about tyingit
to the stimulus package still pend-

Inspection reports
from peanut plant
vary widely
AGeorgiahealth inspectorwho
toured the peanut butter plant
now at the center of a national sal-
monella outbreak noted only two
minor violations in October. Less
than three months later, federal

inspectors found roaches, mold, a
leaking roof and other sanitation
problems.
Food safety experts say the lapse
is a major concern and shows state
inspectors are spread thin and
might need more training on how
to spot unsanitary conditions.
"It's surprising to me that that
many major deficiencies were
observed at one time, and none of
these were picked up previously,"
said Michael Doyle, head of the
food safety center at the Univer-
sity of Georgia.
In October, state inspector
Donna Adams noted only two vio-

"black buildup" and "mildew and
possibly some static dust on ceil-

Colemansaid the reason the Uni-

One reason to have all the stu-

Additionally, Sullivan said for a
sophomore to transfer to the Uni-

work than a junior transfer, as the
student's college and high school
career must be considered. When
a student applies for a junior trans-
fer, the University only considers
the student's college career.
On average from the fall of

Congress mulls stimulus

Republican leader
Mitch McConnell

WASHINGTON (AP) - Repub-

Senate's stimulus proposal because
they said it doesn't pump enough
into the private sector through tax
cuts but allows Democrats to go on
a spending spree unlikely to jolt
the economy.
"When I say start from scratch,
what I mean is that the basic
approach of this bill, we believe, is
wrong," said Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizo-
na, the No. 2 Republican. He added
that he was seeing an erosion of

PRISONERS
From Page 1A
plan's intention is not to save
money by decreasing safety but
rather to move toward rehabilitat-
ing newly released prisoners into
mainstream society rather than
keeping them jailed for unneces-
sary long periods of time.
The plan, which is supported
by Gov. Jennifer Granholm, would
put Michigan on par with the
other states around the country
including California, New Jersey
and South Carolina, states that are
currently looking at re-evaluating
their sentencing policies.
The analysis does not advocate
for releasing prisoners early but
rather that their minimum and
maximum sentences be more rep-
resentative to the crimes they com-
mitted, according to the report.
By creating a tighter timeframe
for which criminals can be jailed,
the state will only be keeping pris-
oners as long as necessary for the
sentence to be fully effective, the
report says.
John Cordell, a public informa-
tion officer in the Department of
Corrections, said the money saved
could be reinvested into other cor-
rections programs that are designed
to keep these prisoners from re-
offending. Cordell said the money
could also be used to fund other
strugglingstate departments.
"There is some reinvestment
that will occur into correctional
and criminal justice depart-
ments," he said. "Once that hap-
pens, we can free up those monies
for things like parks, education
and expenses for college."
Supporters of using the study's
findings to transform prison sen-
tencing laws hope to have the leg-
islature pass the proposal by April

and to have it melded into budget-
ary decisions for the 2009-2010
fiscal year.
State Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann
Arbor) said that she supports mak-
ingthestate'sprisonsentencingmore
like other states but thinks the report
only addresses some of the issues
within the state prisonsystem.
"I think it's a good start," she
said. "I think we have to start from
here and then there's obviously a
lot more we can do. The issue of
people with mental illness is not
addressed, and these people are
ending up being criminalized."
Brater said that the legislature is
currently taking a look at the prob-
lem of people with mental illnesses
being put in prisons as opposed to
gettingthe care they need.
"We are currently doing a study
to analyze the incidence of men-
tal illness among the Michigan
prison population," Brater said.
"Hopefully this issue will lead us
to redirect that money to mental
health care. Treating someone
with a mental illness as an outpa-
tient would mean spending $8,000
to $11,000 each year as opposed to
$32,000 in the prisons."
With a reduction in the num-
ber of prisoners, some argue that
there is potential for a reduction of
the employees needed to maintain
the prison system.
Public Policy Prof. Paul Courant
said he thinks the legislature will
not only be debating the possibility
of having more previously convict-
ed felons free than in jail, but also
that legislators of certain constitu-
encies will have to consider the
potential loss of employment by
people who work in the prisons.
"The state budget is under pres-
sure, and there is a lot of interest
in cutting costs, but people in the
legislature don't want to appear
soft on crime," he said.

"We cannot delay this," said Sen.
Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Demo-
crats' No.2 leader. "Wecan'tengage
in the old political rhetoric of say-
ing, 'Well, maybe it could be a little
bit better here and a little bit better
there.' We've got to pull together."
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,
agreed that more could be done
in the area of housing, though he
said tapping money in the separate
financial bailout fund would be a
more likely way to pay for mort-
gage relief.
Under Obama's plan, strained
state budgets would receive a
cash infusion, projects for roads
and other infrastructure would
be funded, and "green jobs" in
the energy sector would be cre-
ated. In its centerpiece tax cut,
single workers would gain $500
and couples $1,000, even if they
don't earn enough to owe federal
income taxes.
Ringenberg said he has observed
the Internet playing an increasing-
ly important part of students' lives
in the last five years.
He added that wireless Internet
access in the classroom has been an
effective tool in delivering infor-
mation and facilitating "student-
driven learning."
Ringenberg noted that tech-
nology is a double-edged sword,
and the benefits of WiFi in the
classroom to supplement course
content must be weighed against
the inherent distractions of
access.
"I don't think it's important to

State should change shelter policies to protect sex offenders
Around 10 a.m. last Monday, 52 year-old Thomas Pauli was
found frozen and lifeless in a Grand Rapids parking lot.
As a registered sex offender, he couldn't enter two of the
city's homeless shelters because of their proximity to a local school.
His status as a sex offender left him nowhere to turn. While many
sex crimes are serious offenses, they should not be accompanied
by a legal and social stigma that leaves a human being with no
choice but to freeze to death. To ensure this never happens again,
the state government must change the way it treats homeless sex
offenders.

Two of Grand Rapids' homeless shel-
ters, the Guiding Light Mission and Mel
Trotter Ministries, can be fined or even
shut down for admitting sex offenders
like Pauli. That's because both shelters
are located within 1,000 feet of Catholic
Central High School. State law prohibits
sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet
of a school, and staying the night at Guid-
ing Light and Mel Trotter falls under this
category. On top of this restriction, Mel
Trotter can't admit sex offenders because
it houses women and children. Before his
death, Pauli was allegedly seen in line at
these shelters, but officials say they would
have had to deny him a bed.
It is tragic that Pauli could not enter
either shelter simply because of their loca-
tions. Restrictions on sex offenders should
be placed to protect civilians - not harm
the offenders themselves. But no matter
how much the shelters would like to help
these people, state law is preventing them.
The stigma placed over sex offenders is
life-altering, and regardless of one's stance
on sex offender laws in general, Pauli's
death should serve as an indicator more
must be done to balance the care of these
people with the state's safety concerns.
This is clearly a difficult matter for state
law, the shelters and homeless sex offend-
ers. On one hand, the state has some legiti-
mate safety interests at heart, and some
good reasons to keep school zones and
certain shelters safe from sex offenders.

But leaving sex offenders with no allow-
able homeless shelters during Michigan's
harsh winters is hardly an acceptable con-
sequence.
In this case, the homeless shelters'
proximity to a school forced them to turn
away Pauli. The best compromise would
be for the state to make sure all homeless
sex offenders have somewhere to turn.
Whether that means changing the law to
allow these shelters to take in sex offend-
ers, setting aside funding to build homeless
shelters outside the school's radius or some
other compromise, the state has a respon-
sibility to take care of these people.
Pauli's death was not the law's inten-
tion, but it was a consequence of policies
that discriminate against sex offenders
and leave them with no way to live in our
society. This mentality toward sex offend-
ers is inhumane - they may have made
mistakes, but they are still human beings.
Homeless sex offenders are in just as much
need as other homeless people, and laws
need to change to provide them with bet-
ter options for care.
This death could have been prevented
if the state government had not created
an environment in which Pauli could not
enter the available homeless shelters. By
paying attention to the location of home-
less shelters and how they relate to restric-
tions on sex offenders, society can provide
a more humane way of life for all homeless
people.

The University tends to make a big
deal about diversity, and that's great.
Diversity is a fantastic thing. But it's
really easy to have too much of a good
thing, and it sometimes results in a
burden on students' already rigorous
academic schedules. For LSA stu-
dents, this burden is most substan-
tially felt in the form of the foreign
language requirement.
As an LSAstudentworkingtowards
my degree, I am extremely frustrat-
ed by the school's insistence that I
achieve fourth-semester proficiency
in a foreign language. When I first
received my course guide last sum-
mer, I hoped the five years of Italian I
took in high school would be enough
to cover any sort of foreign language
requirement. Was I ever wrong.
Luckily for me, my limited skill in
the Italian language allowed for me
to skip out on the first semester -
that is, if you consider having to take
three more semesters of a language
you never wanted to hear again lucky.
The simple fact is that I'm never
going to use Italian, in any form. If I
do happen to take a vacation to Italy,
and if I actu-ally remember any of
the language,I can ask the tourist
shop cashier, "Do you have this shirt
in blue?" Yeah, Mom, all those thou-
sands of tuition dollars you spent
went toward that.
Quite frankly, this requirement is
a waste. While proficiency in a for-

eign language might be a nice skill,
it's hardly a necessity, especially in
a globalized world where it seems as
if everyone speaks English already.
And as an out-of-state student, I'm
basically spending $5,000 for each
foreign language course I'm forced to
take. I'd much rather put that money
towards courses I actually have a use
for.
Sure, a foreign language compo-
nent to a liberal arts degree has some
merit. It fits right in with the quota
of natural science credits that have
to be met, as well as the quantitative
reasoning requirement that basically
means you have to take some form
of math at some point to earn your
degree. The idea behind these quo-
tas is logical; a liberal arts degree
should be well-rounded and include
of fields.
But what's ridiculous is that stu-
dents are required to achieve fourth-
semester proficiency in a foreign
language. Unless you're already
talented enough to test out of some
(hopefully all) of these courses, you'll
have to spend one-eighth of your 120
total credit hours learning a language
that you'll most likely never use
again.
And what's worse is how much the
foreign language component seems to
outweigh the other components of the
degree. Why a student is required to
take over twice as many credit hours

in a foreign language than in either
science or math is beyond me. The
lack of an actual math component to
an LSA degree is another issue alto-
gether. Under the Bachelor of Arts
degree requirements, LSA students
don't have to take any math courses,
and I intend to take full advantage of
this absurdity.
Sadly, this foreign language
requirement is also driving students
away from LSA. I've met people who
have left LSA because they didn't
want to take four semesters of a for-
eign language, choosing to opt for
majors in other schools that don't
have this requirement. Students
shouldn't be driven away from an
education that might be best suited
for them simply because one of the
degree requirements is detestable.
Liberal arts degree requirements
should be challenging - but should
also not be a deterrence.
This isn't an attack on foreign
languages. They definitely have a
place in education. But their level of
emphasis in LSA's required curricu-
lum is preposterous. Sadly, regardless
of whether I'm right or not, I'm still
going to have to make it through Ital-
ian 232. In the meantime, it's going to
wreak havoc on my GPA, give me a lot
of tedious busywork and annoy the
crap out of me.

"Step one: Conquer Cuba. Step two: Conquer the T-shirt of every rebellious American 7th-grader."
A muddled

Soderbergh's mammoth
biopic lacks the focus to
reveal the nuances of its
legendary subject
By IMRAN SYED
Daily Arts Writer
Che Guevara is unquestionably one
of the most polarizing figures in human
history, continuing
even today to inspire
masses of both lovers *Ik
and haters.
The guerilla war- Gie
rior at the heart of At the Michigan
the Cuban Revolution, IFC Films
Guevara remains the
most enduring symbol
of the radical left, seen as a selfless libera-
tor by many and as a ruthless mercenary
by just as many others. Director Steven
Soderbergh's sprawling 257-minute trib-
ute to the man is similarly enigmatic,

with a lively first part to draw in audi-
ences and a grueling second part to drive
them away.
Most viewers will see the two parts
separately, but the "Special Roadshow
Edition" playing at the Michigan The-
ater through Friday is a chance to take
in a truly unique experience. For an
elevated ticket price ($12 for students),
viewers can see both parts with a
20-minute intermission and also get a
handy little collector's edition program.
If the thought of over four hours of gue-
rilla action is too daunting, the theater
is permitting viewers to leave at inter-
mission and return on a later day for the
second part.
Part one of the film is about the Cuban
Revolution, with a young Guevara (Bene-
cio del Toro, "Traffic") commanding
guerillas for Fidel Castro's 26th of July
Movement. Interspersed among the gritty
action sequences are cuts forward in time
to Guevara speaking to American report-
ers and to the United Nations on behalf of
Castro's Cuba. What emerges is a rather
complete image of a man convinced of his

I epic
cause and unrelenting in his methods.
Fart two focuses on Guevara's subse-
quent attempt to launch a leftist revolu-
tion in Bolivia. Older and - in the cold
mountain air - more prone to the asthma
attacks that plagued him his whole life,
Guevara is weaker, his efforts errant
and unsuccessful. Del Toro, whose work
earned him the Best Actor award at last
year's Cannes Film Festival, drives both
parts with an intensely focused, brooding
performance.
The film is appropriately dark and
elusive, yet also unfocused and mud-
dled. It embraces Guevara's immortal
persona, one del Toro wears very well.
But ultimately, there's no answer to the
questions of "why this film?" and "why
now?". Most directors who take on
ambitious projects about timeless icons
will have a deeply personal or socially
timely reason for doing so. If Soderbergh
feels such a connection to this work, he
certainly hides it well.
Just as he did with his abrasively naive
approach to "The Good German" three

Ilike graffiti. It's not because of the
allure of running around at ungodly
hours and spraying art all over estab-
lishments and alleyways,
or the danger of being
caught by "The Man"
for the sake of artistic -
creation. I like graffiti
because it's art made by
the people, seen by the
people. You can't get N9NTEY
better free visibility any- PW
where else than on pub-
lic property, because "public property," in
some circles, also means "public visibility."
While the passing of the Ann Arbor anti-
graffiti ordinance might suggest an urge to
repress graffiti art, I think we've begun to
see more of a cultural acceptance of graffiti-
type images in contemporary culture.
Take the Barack Obama "HOPE" poster by
Shepard Fairey, for example. Those bright
patches of solid red and blue and thick,
contrast-heavy lines are reminiscent of
spray-painted graffiti art stencils and silk-
screen prints, a la Andy Warhol's Marilyn
(Monroe) prints.
The iconic image of Obama was original-
ly created by Fairey in an attempt to get the
word out about the then-presidential can-
didate. Fairey is also a graffiti artist and the
person behind the Andr6 the Giant "OBEY"
graffiti posters that had begun poppingup
wheat-pasted to buildings in cities like New
York and Chicago.
Fairey mentioned in his interview with
Stephen Colbert on "The Colbert Report"
that, instead of resorting to illegal distribu-
lion tactics forhis Obama image, he wanted
to get the word out legitimately - he decid-
ed to wait for the support of the Obama
campaign administration. Once permission
was granted, his "HOPE" became the unof-
ficial image of the Obama campaign.
This legitimizing of graffiti art is intrigu-
ing because graffiti has classically been
labeled as illegal and somewhat of a nui-
sance to property owners. It's easy to get
mired down in all the political and prop-
erty-based arguments against graffiti, but
it's equally importantto look at graffiti art's
visibility and how Fairey's stencil graffiti-
style "HOPE" became so widespread and
iconic. I think it has a lot to do with two
elements - the image's stylization and its
extensive distribution.
Fairey's Obama stencil image manages
to find a middle ground between the pho-
torealistic and the abstract. Certain details
are made more prominent, like the detailed,
contemplative eyes that look off the plane
of the poster, and the mouth that's drawn
in a way that not only makes the face more
recognizable, but gives the image a more
regal, self-assured look. And certain details
are removed, like skin textures and hair

textures that may serve to smooth over indi-
vidualistic details, moving the image from
the realm of "individual portrait" to that of
"recognizable icon."
We've seen this in Warhol's Marilyn.
The lack of detail in the image, in conjunc-
tion with its recognizable quality, makes
the image pop out and become something
visible over a longer distance. It's simi-
lar, in a way, to logo branding. When you
simplify a restaurant chain's name into
two golden arches, you make an "M" that
people equate with "loving it," Big Macs
and fries.
Similarly, when you boil down a person's
image to its simplest parts, you create a
symbol. Marilyn Monroe's image became
a symbol for glamour and fame in the'60s.
Obama's image is equated with "HOPE"
or "CHANGE," as these are ideas his cam-
paign tried to introduce into the mass con-
sciousness.
But don't forget the visibility of the
image. The mass-produced quality of War-
hol's Marilyn prints is important to the
artwork as well. One of his pieces features
ten silkscreen prints of Monroe's face set
next to one another; each image is produced
using different colors for the lips, eyes, skin
and mouth. The repetition of the image,

and the use of the image of a famous figure,
seem to recreate what happens when an
image is placed everywhere for the public to
see: It becomes immediately recognizable
by large groups of people.
Similarly, Obama's face has had incred-
ible visibility as a symbol and logo. The
red and blue"O"logo is more than just an
"O;" it represents the beliefs and slogans
-of the entire Obama campaign. The idea
of mass-visibility has also changed a great
deal since society placed more importance
on the internet as an information highway.
Fairey's poster was initially released online
for the public to use and distribute, and it
immediately went viral, spreading between
users through e-mail, forums and online
communities.
It's interesting to see the spread of image
visibility occurring primarily within a vir-
tual space. The internet was the starting
point that spawned stickers, T-shirt and

And several U-M graduate students
recently won $10,000 for their "winning

Saving' Heroes'

Manners vs. makeup

'Heroes' looks to
right itself in its
fourth season
By DAVE REAP
Daily TV/New Media Editor
While it's no secret NBC's
"Heroes" needs
resuscitation, Heroes
how to rescue the
super-powered Mondays
! action-drama at 9 p.m.
is one of televi- NBC
sion's greatest
mysteries.
"Heroes" creator Tim Kring
was once overwhelmed with
praise for the show's outstanding
freshman season. But after two
years, ithas become commonplace
for Kring to apologize to fans for
the series' rapid deterioration.
He does, after all, have plenty to
apologize for: beloved characters
have been mishandled, tiresome
plots have been recycled and sim-
ply uninspiring storytelling has
become the norm. Though Kring's
mea culpas are often laced with
promises of a forthcoming resur-
gence, this has yet to come, and
ratings have steadily declined as
viewers have grown impatient. All
this begs the question of whether
the series can survive if it doesn't

receive the much-needed boost.
A strong start to the show's
fourth season, titled "Heroes:
Fugitives" (which begins tonight),
could help put an end to such fatal-
istic thinking. Admittedly, this all
sounds familiar. The series's third
go-around, "Heroes: Villains,"
which began in September, was
supposed to atone for the show's
lackluster second installment -
but it didn't. With "Villains," Kring
and his creative team sought to re-
energize the "Heroes" fan base by
introducing characters who use
their powers for nefarious purpos-
es. They also promised a season-
long battle royale between these
new evil characters and their more
moralistic counterparts. Instead,
the "Villains"overloaded theseries
with empty new characters and
nonchalantly toyed with viewers'
conceptions of the originals. As the
season progressed, it became clear
"Villains" wasn't as much about
providing meaningful character
development - which fans have
beenyearning for - as it was about
merely shocking people.
Accordingly, Kring's declara-
tion that "Fugitives" will restore
"Heroes" to its former glory should
be taken with a grain of salt. Yet
there is also reason for his opti-
mism to be infectious. Racking
their brains to find the root cause
of the show's recent problems, the

"Heroes" creative team reached
a compelling diagnosis, and the
"Fugitives" storyline has been
designed to directly correct the ills.
Kring's theory is that his central
characters have become too much
like superheroes and less like nor-
mal people with superpowers, mak-
ing them less relatable. He recently
explained to Comic Book Resources
how "Fugitives" will help remedy
this problem: "Once (the charac-
ters) are on the run they become
much more ordinary. ... (We can
get) back no who these characters
are by making them fugitives."
NBC released footage online
that shows the cast blending back
into society and carefully using
their powers so they aren't discov-
ered. Essentially, Kring has devel-
oped a thoughtful way to make
his heroes less super by revoking
their status as masters of their
environment, putting them back in
the vulnerable position they were
in throughout the show's highly
acclaimed first season.
Undoubtedly, "Heroes" is at a

Kring has the vision required to
save his show, and now it's just
a matter of execution. Perhaps
"Heroes" is cursed to never come
close to matching its opening act,
but if there was ever a time for
Kring to show us that it can, the
time is now.

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Reality shows have simply
become too formulaic in the past
several years.
It's easy to cre-
ate drama by *k
selecting the
right mixture of True Beauty
people (the crier, Mondays at
the instigator, 10 p.m.
the hot people A
who always hook ABC
up, etc.) and
then giving them a common goal
to fight over, whether it's the love
and affection of Mr. Sexy or being
dubbed the best singer/dancer/
model/hairstylist in America.
ABC's "'True Beauty" breaks that
mold and puts a new spin on the
overplayed, ordinary format.
The contestants of "True Beau-
ty" (four men and six women) think
they're being judged on appearance
alone for the prize of being featured
in the "100 Most Beautiful Peo-
ple" issue of People. Each episode,
they're given a challenge to prove
they're stylish, photogenic and
capable of being among the world's
most attractive people. Granted,
this follows the typical form of real-
ity television. And just as expected,
the contestants gossip, sabotage

and back-stab.
But here's the catch: The contes-
tants are actually being judged on
their "inner beauty." Each episode
contains several hidden challenges
to test their compassion, charity and
honesty - and thank goodness for
that. The contestants are conceited,
materialistic and in great need of the
lesson the show is trying to teach:
True beauty comes from within.
Lo and behold, the concept
makes for a surprisingly entertain-
ing show. In this grand-scale social
experiment, it's impossible not to
wonder who is going to hold the
door open for the man who has his
hands full and who is going to let
the door shut behind them, leav-
ing the man outside (yes, someone
actually did that, and it resulted
in her elimination). It's satisfying
knowing the contestants are going
to get what they deserve, and the
creators aren't just keeping the
annoying people on the show to
fuel the drama.
"True Beauty," however, is not
without flaws. The producers have
practicallycreatedtworealityshows
in one, which definitely poses some
problems. Unfortunately, the nicest
peopleontheshowaretheoneswho
suck at the petty, superficial beauty
competitions, and the contestants
are already getting suspicious as to

how those people weren't already
eliminated. Similarly, those who
lack inner beauty often perform
well in the beauty challenges, forc-
ing the judges to fabricate vague
reasons for why they should be
eliminated ("I just don't think your
look is unique"). The judges try to
solve this conundrum by episodi-
cally putting one contestant who

than skin deep.
fails the beauty challenge and one
who fails the "hidden" challenge
up forelimination; but this makes it
unbelievably easy for the audience
to guess which of the two is going
to be kicked off.
Despite the show's many poten-
tial problems - "True Beauty" may
only take a few more episodes for
the contestants to figure out the
catch - itsunique and original con-
cept is refreshing and it compen-
sates for the imperfect execution.
"True Beauty" is an honest show
with an inspiring message, though
it's uncertain whether or not any of
the contestants will take this mes-
sage to heart.

From Page 5A
years ago, it seems that Soder-
bergh sees "Che" as a fun little
prerogative earned by his other
directorial achievements. He has
again created a unique film that

(with the intermission and pro-
grams provided with the ticket)
hearkens to the days of old Hol-
lywood. And again, he seems to
have no purpose for his travail
other than his own amusement.
Guevara was a monumental fig-
ure whose life affected millions; a
story about his life should be more
than a kickback for some hotshot

Hollywood director.
While far from essential or even
consequential, as it may have been
under a different guiding hand,
"Che" isreasonablyinterestingand
watchable. Still, it's hard to ignore
thefactthatGuevara'slarger-than-
life story and del Toro's uncanny
ability to embody it did not result
in something more.

graffiti created by people interest-
ed in the Obama campaign. Virtual
accessibility of the image created
mass visibility. It's something
very different from Warhol's time,
where Monroe's face became icon-
ic because of its repeated presence
within the print media - Obama's
face became iconic because of its

repeated presence on websites and
places like Facebook. The media is
just moving online.
In this sense, Fairey's "HOPE"
poster has risen to its iconic
status because of both its pop-
art roots as well asits ability to
be quickly mass-produced and
spread. Just as the Marilyn prints
were created using silk-screening,
which is used to efficiently mass-
produce a single image, "HOPE"
was created by a graffiti artist
who utilized the internet to mass-

produce his own work.
While the idea of mass-visibility
might have once concerned print
publications and the placing of
graffiti tags or images where peo-
ple can see them (illicitly on public
buildings, for example), the Obama
poster has become a type of vir-
tual graffiti: an art for the people,
spread by the people.

Ejection of
Harris ends
Michigan's
upset bid
By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
WEST LAFAYETTE - Purdue guard Chris
Kramer lay motionless on the floor inside
Mackey Arena, a pool of blood expanding under
his head.
Standing over him, Michigan sophomore
forward Manny Harris looked around in shock,
trying to figure out what had just happened.
With the Michigan men's basketball team
clinging to a two-point lead with 18:28 left in
the second half, Harris received the ball on the
left wing, squared up to the basket to clear space
and sideswiped Kramer's nose with his elbow.
"That's the hardest I've ever been hit," Kram-
er, who played football in high school, said after
Purdue's 67-49 victory. "That was as square as
can be, right on the side of my nose.... I wouldn't
go there and say that was definitely a dirty play.
Anybody would be frustrated in a game like
that, but it was just a basketball play."
Kramer fell to the ground, and the official
called an offensive foul on Harris. As the Pur-
due faithful harassed Harris, erupting in boos
and "throw him out" chants, the head official,
Jim Burr, decided the hit was intentional and
ejected Harris.
"It wasn't intentional at all," Harris said in
the locker room following the game. "I was just
ripping through, and his face happened to be
in the way. ... I feel like it was unfair but, at the.
same time, things happen."
When Harris left the floor, so too did Michi-
gan's chances of victory. The Boilermakers
dominated the final 18 minutes and cruised to
a 67-49 victory. It was Michigan's fifth loss in
six games.
See BOILERMAKERS, Page 3B

AREL BOND/Daily
Junior acting captain Chris Summers, sophomore forward Aaron Palushaj and senior forward Travis Turnbull argued with the referees in the final minute of Saturday's 3-2 loss to Notre
Dame. The call in question was an apparent goal by junior defenseman Steve Kampfer, which would have tied the score and likely sent the game into overtime.
Inco)nsistency mars 'M' in split

Ieers snap Notre
Dame's 20-game
unbeaten streak Friday
By GJON JUNCAJ
Daily Sports Writer
SOUTH BEND - For the Michigan
hockey team, last weekend's home-and-
home series with top-ranked Notre
Dame provided two nights of high-
quality drama.
The Wolverines snapped Notre
Dame's 20-game unbeaten streak on
Friday. Saturday featured a penalty shot
goal, and another tally off a skate that
arguably should not have counted. That

was followed by a disallowed marker
in the waning moments that arguably
should have stood.
Players and coaches from both teams
admitted the
series split MICHIGAN 2
was a "nerve- NOTREDAME 1

experience. NOTRE DAME 3
After win- MICHIGAN 2
ning Friday's
nailbiter at
the Joyce Center, Michigan nearly
completed an improbable comeback
during Saturdays third period. Power-
play goals by sophomore Aaron Palush-
aj and freshman Robbie Czarnik cut
Notre Dame's lead to one. Palushaj and
Czarnik, both of whom scored their
first goals of the semester, revived the

deflated atmosphere at Yost Ice Arena
after the Irish took an early 3-0 lead.
The early deficits against the Irish
has become an annoying habit the
past two seasons. In last yea's Frozen
Four semifinals, the Wolverines rallied
from a three-goal deficit before los-
ing in overtime. Earlier that season in
January, Michigan fell behind Notre
Dame by two goals before scoring three
straight for a thrilling win at Yost.
But this time, when Michigan's
comeback bid reached its peak, a third
party changed the game's outcome.
With 31 seconds remaining in the
game, senior forward Tim Miller fired
a point-blank shot into Irish goaltender
Jordan Pearce's pads. A scrum ensued,
and the puck came loose from under-
neath Pierce. Junior defenseman Steve

Kampfer batted the puck into the net,
only to have it waved off.
"I think I just wanted to crash the
net, and I was kind of just looking and
hoping that the puck would hit me on
the stick," Kampfer said. "But I looked
down and it was right in front of me. I
think I shot at the net three times."
Referee Brian Aaron, who was posi-
tioned near the blue line, blew the play
dead because he apparently saw the
net come off its moorings, even though
a video replay.showedno evidence of
movement.
Fellow referee John Philo' was sta-
tioned next to the post to the right of
Pierce for the would-be tying goal, yet
never blew his whistle. Despite his per-
fect positioning on the play, Philo didn't

Play on the ice should decide outcome, not refs

SOUTH BEND -
hough it sat in sixth place in
the conference just over a week
ago, the Michigan hockey team
still had a shot at defending its CCHA
regular-season title.
Despite playing poorly for the first
two periods Saturday, the Wolverines
still gave themselves a chance to beat
No. 1 Notre Dame.
Even against the nation's best scor-
ing defense (just 1.59 goals per game
allowed), No. 8 Michigan still nearly
overcame a three-goal deficit in the
third period.
All of that makes Saturday's 3-2 loss
completely agonizing because it came
down to poor refereeing - plain and

simple.
And it's not difficult to decipher
what Michigan.
coach Red Beren-
son thought about
its effect on the
game.
"I'm not here to ;
discuss the officiat-
ing, but this was
a big series, and
obviously you want MICHAE1
top officials here," EISENST
Berenson said. EISENST__
The referees in
question: Brian
Aaron and John Philo.
Before this season, Aaron had a

questionable reputation in many peo-
ple's books.
"(Referee Brian Aaron) needs a big
red nose and floppy feet," Northern
Michigan play-by-play announcer Dave
Danis commented during a November
loss to Michigan State in 2005.
Philo is a first-year referee and was
promoted to the position in the offsea-
son when the CCHA switched from a
one-referee to a two-referee system.
The game could have easily been a
3-1 Michigan win if it weren't for two
blatantly botched calls that stood out
in a contest filled with questionable
ones.
The first was Notre Dame's goal
midway through the opening period.

Freshman Irish forward Billy Maday
redirected a puck with his left skate,
and pushed the puck past sophomore
goalie Bryan Hogan's right leg.
The play was illegal - and there's
really no room for debate.
"A goal shall not be allowed if the
puck has been kicked or directed
into the goal off an attacking player's
skate," the NCAA rule reads.
The problem: was that none of the
officials saw the obvious play, and
when it went to video review, the kick
took place outside of the frame of the
camera hanging over the net. And
that's the only angle that Aaron was
allowed to look at, due to.CCHA rules,

Blue ties Wildcats, beats Hoosiers in physical meet

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
The battered Big Ten sign at
the scorers' table was a constant
reminder.
The physicality of this weekend's
conference meets started after
Michigan fifth-year senior Tyrel
Todd threw Northwestern's John
Schoen into the table Saturday.
And the dented sign foreshadowed
Michigan's grueling meet against
Indiana the next day.
The 18th-ranked Wolverines
salvaged a 17-17 tie against North-
western in a hard-hitting contest
Saturday before taking out Indiana
20-18 on Sunday afternoon.

The Wolverines were down by
six points or more heading into the
last five individual matches in both
meets.
Redshirt sophomore Eddie Phil-
lips (Heavyweight) pulled off a 3-2
win in double overtime in the final
match to tie Northwestern.
"We wrestled more confident
and with more intensity than IShave
seen all year," Michigan coach Joe
McFarland said. "It's a good time to
get into the Big Ten season."
Down six points against Indiana,
redshirt sophomore Aaron Hynes
(157 pounds) sparked the comeback
with a victory over 12th-ranked
Kurt Kinsler. Recovering from a
shoulder injury, it was Hynes' first-

ever win over a ranked opponent,
but he almost gave it away.
After going up 5-0 halfway
through the match, he gave up con-
secutive takedowns and the con-
test was eventually tied 6-6 when
time expired in the final period.
But because of his one-minute rid-
ing-time advantage, he earned the
extra point and victory.
"I used to have that problem
where I would let the momentum
of the (meet) carry into mine,"
Hynes said. "But then I was just
like, 'Hey it has nothing to do with'
me, I'm just gonna go out there and
wrestle."'
After losing to Northwestern
senior Jake Herbert on Friday, the

No. 1 wrestler in the country at his
weight, redshirt sophomore Antho-
ny Biondo (184 pounds) broke out
of his four-match losing streak and
beat Indiana redshirt sophomore
Nick Avery 10-0. During the match,
Avery gave the crowd a reason to
be upset. He repeatedly backed up
and failed to make moves, and the
fans at Cliff Keen Arena chanted
"staaaaaalling, staaaaaalling" for
much of the match.
The win gave Michigan a lead it
would never relinquish.
"I could've cut him and went
back up on my feet," Biondo said. "It
wouldn't have really made a differ-
ence, I would have just taken him
down a bunch of times. I wanted to

snaps losing streak
'Clammy Sosa'mascot p
mirrors dominating
Wolverine victory
By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Writer3
Early in the second half of theK
Michigan women's basketball game T
yesterday against Wisconsin, a base-e
ball-playing clam mascot named
"Clammy Sosa" walked onto the .
court during a timeout. The clam
walked over to a Wisconsin student
assistant and promptly "ingested"
him.
According to the official Clammy
Sosa website, the mascot "slurps up ;
and swallows everything in sight."p
The clam walked off the court-
when the timeout ended, the assis-
tant still trapped inside of it with his
feet dangling.
Like Clammy Sosa, Michigan
swallowed the Badgers - figuratively,
of course - winning the game 70-42
to snap their six-game losing streak.
Former players Katie Dierdorf
and Krista Clement, both 2008
graduates, were in attendance, and
they had no doubt the Wolverines
would come out strong..
"We are completely confident
they can pull it out tonight," Clem-
ent said before the game. "They
killed us a few years ago, so we have
some bad memories of Wisconsin."
Michigan didn't disappoint.

Keep Yost a
hands-on arena

No touching" is the rule
for visitors at prisons, at
least if Arrested Devel-
opment can be trusted. But the
Michigan Athletic Department
sent an email to students this
week that threatened to take the
first step toward making Yost Ice
Arena a hands-
off venue.
To set the
context for f
those of you
who have been
under a rock
for over a week
.now, here is a NATE
brief history S
of whathap-
pened: Late in
last Saturday
night's 5-3 win over Michigan State,
two Spartans viciously attacked
Michigan defenseman Steve Kamp-
fer. As Kampfer lay motionless on
the ice, a very loud chant started
rumbling from the student section.
"F.Y.S."would be an appropriate
acronymfor the chant.
Minutes later, Kampfer's father,
Bruce, entered the visiting locker
room and went after one of the
Michigan State players involved in
the incident.
On Thursday, the Athletic
Department announced increased
security standards around the visit-
ing locker room at Yost. That same
day, students received the afore-
mentioned e-mail with the not-so-
coded subject, "Fan Behavior."
Here is the key excerpt from
EISENS
From page 1B
meaning there wasn't enough
video evidence to overturn the
call.
"If that would have been
reviewable - the camera couldn't
see it - it would not have been a
goal," Berenson said.
Still, it's tough to argue the
referees mangled the entire game
with one bad call eight minutes
and 15 seconds into the game.
Michigan had plenty of time to
even up the score.
But the only thing to excuse
Aaron's premature blowing of the
whistle with less than a minute
left in the game is blindness. Hell,
that might not even be a good
enough explanation.
As junior defenseman Steve

that e-mail: "We believe the fan
conduct last week was not appro-
priate to Michigan standards
and will not be tolerated in the
future. The actions on the ice do
not excuse what was heard or
displayed.... We will eject, with-
out warning, individuals who use
profane language and/or make
obscene gestures."
That's all well and good in
theory, but part of being a fan at a
sporting event is reacting to what
takes place on the ice.
Clearly, what the Michigan
State players did was serious.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
been suspended for the rest of the
season. When something serious
happens in the course of a game,
the players, coaches and referees
have an avenue to respond.
But so do the fans - and they
have to do it with words instead of
actions.
When tensions are high on the
ice, they should be high in the
stands, too.
If the fans weren't meant to
have a voice in how a game plays
out, why would the Athletic
Department be shelling out free
tickets to men's basketball games,
giving out thunder sticks at hock-
ey games and sending out count-
less e-mails urging students to go
to women's basketball games?
The Athletic Department
knows fans are important to cre-
ate a winning environment for its
teams, but now they're trying to
tie fans' hands.

Whatever the terms and condi-
tions listed on the back of each
ticket, the events at the end of last
Saturday's game more than war-
ranted the response the student
section gave. It's probably a small
miracle the animosity didn't man-
ifest in more dangerous ways.
And the real reason the Ath-
letic Department is so upset is
that "FY.S." was clearly audible
on television and YouTube videos
that have been viewed more than
300,000 times.
Of course, the Athletic Depart-
ment has the right to eject any
fan, at any time, for any reason.
But going too far down that path
threatens to take awayone of the
pillars of Michigan hockey - the
Yost student section.
No one is saying the student
section is perfect. Chants often
go over the line. But the well-rea-
soned majority always manages
to rein in the outliers. When some
students threw objects on the ice
after last Saturday's game, their
peers booed them.
The student section has proven
capable of policing itself.
If the Athletic Department
wants to play assistant principal
from here on out, well, there's not
much the students can do.
But the Athletic Department
has a choice here, and the right
one is to keep Yost a hands-on
arena.

TEIN Refs stay out

Kampfer poked away at a loose
puck next to sprawled-out Notre
Dame goalie Jordan Pearce, Aaron
blew the whistle because he sup-
posedly saw the net come loose.
For what it's worth, he was
standing 60 feet away at the
blue line, and a scrum occurred
in front of the goal, obstructing
Aaron's view. Philo, who was
positioned right next to the goal,
didn't make a call on the play..
And a split-second later, Kamp-
fer put the puck into the net,
potentially tying the game and
causing senior forward Travis
Turnbull to throw his hands up
into the air in celebration. But the
play was ruled dead, and Aaron
reviewed the play and waved off
the apparentgoal. The Wolverines
had to settle for-the split when

they had a legitimate shot at mak-
ing a run at another conference
title.
"Now, if the net comes off
because their player pushed it
off, I mean that's a serious infrac-
tion in the last two minutes of the
game," Berenson said. "But I don't
know (whether) they pushed it .
off or if it was just the scrum that
pushed it off."
And he probably doesn't know
because not a soul in Yost Ice
Arena saw that post move a hun-
dredth of a centimeter except
Aaron, and that cost the Wolver-
ines the game.
How did he end up with a
whistle?

FIGHTING IRISH
From page lB
appear to contest Aaron's ruling,
which was upheld after an official
review.
The decision halted the Michi-
gan comeback and effectively
ended the game. Saturday's final
frame, where Michigan outshot
Notre Dame 14-3, marked the best
period the Wolverines played all
weekend.
The Wolverines set up three
scoring chances in front of the net
with crossing passes in the game's
final minutes, but couldn't get a
shot off any of them.
"You're never safe in this build-
ing," Notre Dame coach Jeff Jack-
son said of Yost. "(The Wolverines
are) a momentum team. The crowd
gets them going."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said last week that he didn'tbelieve
in a "switch" that talented teams
can "turn on" during moments of
crisis. But if such a thing exists, it
certainly appeared off as the Wol-
verines entered the third period
down by three goals.
Tied for fourth place in the
CCHA standings, the Wolverines
are in good position for a first-

round bye in next month's con-
ference tournament. "Urgency"
remains the operative word for
the second half of this season, and
Michigan showed plenty of it dur-
ing Saturday's final 20 minutes.
"I think we played'with more
desperation in the third," Beren-
son said. "But you can't play one
period against a team like Notre
Dame."
Turnovers and defensive break-
downs throughout the first two
periods proved to be Michigan's
undoing. Eight minutes into the
game; Irish forward Calle Rid-
derwall intercepted a Miller pass
inside the Wolverine blueline. Rid-
derwall then slid the puck to.for-
ward Billy Maday, who redirected
it with his skate past sophomore
goaltender Bryan Hogan for the
critical first goal.
Four minutes into the second
period, Notre Dame forward Ryan
Thang took an outlet pass in front
of Kampfer, who was out of posi-
tion, and raced to the net. Kamp-
fer hooked Thang down before he
could get a shot on Hogan, draw-
ing a penalty shot.
Thang made good on his second
chance, beating Hogan glove-side.
It was the first penalty-shot goal
against the Wolverines since 1997.

The Irish, hailed last week by
Berenson as the best forecheck-
ing team in the conference, played
excellent positional hockey during
Saturday's first 40 minutes. Notre
Dame's forwards harassed Michi-
gan's skaters as they tried breaking
out into transition, and packed the
neutral zone to get into the passing
lanes and disrupt the Wolverines'
timing.
"That's where they generate
so much of their speed," Jackson
said. "Michigan's a great team....
They're great offensive speed in
transition and they're very skilled.
They take full advantage of it."
Wolverine acting captain Chris
Summers said Michigan simply put
on a better effort during the final 4
20 minutes. Palushaj and Czarnik
also indicated that the Wolverines
suffered from lapses in intensity in
the first and second frames.
Despite missing a golden oppor-
tunity for a sweep, the players
seemed to take solace from their
third-period performance.
"We showed glimpes of(energy)
in the first and second," Palushaj
said. "We showed a couple shifts
here and there, but it wasn't a full
two periods. (If) we come out like
we did in the third, we're a tough
team to play against."

iClfgan must step up on the roau From pageE

ifit wants to make tournament

WEST LAFAYETTE -
A Manny Harris exited
the Mackey Arena floor
follow-
ing his ejection
early in the
second half, the
crowd inside
the old, rickety
venue was deaf-
ening.
Boilermark-
er fans seemed RUTH
ready to jump LINCOLN
outoftheir seats
to hold a towel
to Purdue guard Chris Kramer's
bloody nose and, um, "escort" Har-
ris to the locker room.
I thought that might not be all
that bad.
The Wolverines' leading scorer
hadn't had a stellar game in awhile.
And in such a hostile environment,
maybe that could have been a spark
for Michigan.
"I gathered the team that was
there at the time," Michigan coach
John Beilein said. "I just said it was
a great opportunity for the guys
that had been waiting for time to
actually step up."
Maybe junior forward DeShawn
Sims would use his agility in the
post, or redshirt freshman Laval
Lucas-Perry's 3-point shot would
resurrect itself.
Even without Harris, maybe the
Wolverines would play solid team
defense like they did to upset Duke
last December.
Clearly, none of that happened,
and Michigan's then-two-point
lead turned into a 67-49 loss.
There was adversity on the
table, and the Wolverines didn't
respond.
As hundreds of fans stormed the
Crisler Arena floor after Michi-

gan's upset win over Duke on Dec.
6, Michigan looked like it might be
the real deal.
Then came the expectations, the
national rankings and the Big Ten
schedule - things haven't been the
same since.
Since the Duke game, the Wol-
verines haven't beaten anyone they
weren't supposed to, and more
importantly, they're 1-4 in confer-
ence road games. Let's be honest.
No one really expected an upset in
West Lafayette, but a clutch road
victory is a necessity for the team's
NCAA Tournament resum6.
And for this team to make the
Big Dance for the first time since
1998, something needs to change
in opposing gyms.
Of the 34 at-large bids in last
year's Tournament, not a single
one had fewer that two conference
road wins.
The Wolverines don't have to
be perfect in their four final Big
Ten road games, but they can't let
games unravel like Saturday.
Michigan matched the Bolil-
ermakers' intensity until Harris's
ejection. The Wolverines can usu-
ally count on Harris to take control
of a game, but when he was gone,
someone needed to make a play
and it was obvious no one did.
"Winningon the road, especially
in this conference, is pretty tough,"
fifth-year senior guard David Mer-
ritt said. "When you have a chance
to get one, you've got to get it....
(We need) to focus. Every single
person has to be willing to give it,
give it all for 40 minutes. You can't
have mental lapses."
And if the Wolverines are going
to erase their mental lapses, they
need a mental leader.
Harris, Sims and Lucas-Perry
have shown their ability in oppos-

Purdue held Harris to just two
points in the first half, but he
started the second with a quick
three points before being ejected.
With Harris out of the game,
the Wolverines (4-6 Big Ten, 14-8
overall) were forced to play with-
out two of their top four scorers.
Freshman guard Zack Novak rode
the bench, serving a suspension
for elbowing Ohio State's P.J. Hill
in the face in Michigan's 72-54
loss Wednesday.
With flagrant fouls in back-to-
back games, Michigan is receiving
criticism from basketball analysts
like Jay Bilas and Clark Kellogg
for playing dirty.
"Obviously, we can't be elbow-
ing each other in the face," Michi-
gan coach John Beilein said. "(The
foul by Harris) was just an unfor-
tunate accident."
Fifth-year senior guard C.J.
Lee filled Novak's spot in the
starting lineup, and he wasn't the
only Wolverine to see increased
playing time. Every player except
redshirt freshman forward Eric
Puls played significant minutes,
and even Puls clocked in a few
garbage minutes. Senior forward
Jevohn Shepherd filled in for
Harris and led Michigan with 10
points.
The Boilermakers (6-2, 17-4)
dominated the last 18 minutes
of the contest, and the fans that
were held at bay in the first half
went into a frenzy. The crowd hit
a high pitch-when Kramer, blood

pin him soit is a little frustrating,
but you just have to keep grind-
ing in the match and try to break
him."
With underclassmen occupy-

covering his face, popped off the
floor and pumped his arms to the
student section. The penalty gave
the Boilermakers what they had
failed to establish all game - the
momentum.
Following Harris's ejection,
Purdue outscored Michigan
40-20.
"There was some slippage in
our defense in the second half,"
Lee said. "To their credit, they
got out in transition and got some
threes and layups. We didn't com-
bat those or make any of our own.
Any time you're not getting stops
or not scoring, the scoreboard is
going to get out of hand."
Michigan shot 32 percent from
the field and was just 2-of-12 from
behind the arc in the second half.
On the other end, Purdue hit 46.2
percent of its shots in the second
frame.
"Obviously, without Harris
and Novak, you take away two
big options," Purdue coach Matt
Painter said. "Especially Harris -
he's such a talented guy, you have
to know where he is at all times.
They don't have the same type of
options."
Michigan was a team basking
in the glory of college basket-
ball a few months ago after wins
over Duke and UCLA. But now,
its NCAA Tournament hopes are
starting to fade.
"It's getting to that break-
ing point where we'll have to do
something," Lee said. "But there's
still time, we still have time right
now. We're not going to waste
time thinking about that and hav-
ing a negative attitude."
ingoseven of the 10 starting spots,
the encouraging opening week-
end is a confidence boost for the
young Wolverines. They will
have to continue growing up pro-
cess as Michigan will be on the
road next weekend in dual meets
against Minnesota and Michigan
State.

ing venues. Combined, they're
averaging just 0.2 points less on
the road than at home in confer-
ence play, but their effort needs to
be timely.
Someone needed to take control
of Saturday's debacle. The Wol-
verines must have a leader on the
road, whether it's Harris, Sims or
someone off the bench.
And what's Beilein's role in
this? His system emphasizes team
offense, but in these situations, he
needs spark. His plays should allow
his star players to shine.

Michigan has Northwestern,
Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota
on its remaining conference road
schedule. Trips to Evanston and
Iowa City looked like easy wins at
the beginning of the season, but
now nothing seems guaranteed.
Every road game needs to be
treated like a must-win. The Wol-
verines needs someone to step up
away from home and can't make
the NCAA Tournament without it.

Pruitt sets school record in shot
put for second time in two weeks

Michigan earns five
wins in Bloomington
By ROGER SAUERHAFT
Daily Sports Writer
Redshirt junior thrower Sean
Pruitt might as well just pour
White-Out all over the Michigan
men's track and field record book.
On Saturday, the second day of
the non-scoring Indiana Relays
in Bloomington, Pruitt won the
weight throw and set a new school
mark for the second time in just
two weeks.
Pruitt's 69.4-foot throw was
nearly three feet longer than his
NCAA provisional performance at
"The Dual" on Jan. 17. Which was
nearly three feet longer than his
previous school record set in Feb-
ruary 2007.
But Pruitt wasn't completely
satisfied with any of the throws.
"I'm getting a lot closer to being
able to finish it properly,". Pruitt
said Saturday. "On that (69.4-foot)
throw, I got in a little late. My left
leg kind of sunk down, so I defi-
nitely sacrificed some distance."
His throw wasn't the only posi-
tive experience of the weekend.
The 15th-ranked Wolverines
competed against several teams,
including Indiana and Notre
Dame, and won five total events.

Two Michigan runners set NCAA
provisional marks Friday night.
Senior Justin Switzer and red-
shirt junior Sean McNamara both
achieved provisional times and per-
sonal bests in the one-mile invita-
tional event.
The Wolverines also received a big
boost over the weekend with the sea-
son debuts of seniors Lex Williams

and Andre Barnes, an All-American.
"(Barnes) still isn't 100 percent,
as far as his fitness goes," head
coach Fred LaPlante said. "He's not
hobbling around the track, so he's
got four weeks to get as good as he
can get and it's really encouraging
for us."
The same can be said for Wil-
liams. After seeing him run a 4:11

mile Saturday, associate head coach
Ron Warhurst expressed hope that
his distance runner could get close
to four minutes flat.
LaPlante said that Michigan's all-
around success, and the experience
of running on a banked track for the
first time this season will help the
Wolverines prepare for the Big Ten
Championships later this month.
