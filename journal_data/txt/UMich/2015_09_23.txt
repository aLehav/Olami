Former vice-chair 
of the U.S Federal 
Reserve calls on 

students to plan ahead

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Retirement may be a long way 

off for the University students 
who attended Tuesday’s Ford 
Policy Talk, but the president 
of one of the nation’s largest 

nonprofit financial institutions 
told them they should start 
planning now.

Roger Ferguson, president and 

CEO of TIAA-CREF, discussed 
financial literacy and economics 
during 
a 
discussion 
with 

University students and faculty.

TIAA is one of the largest 

nonprofit financial institutions 
in the nation and one of the 
retirement policy providers for 
the University.

Ferguson, 
the 
former 

vice chairman of the Board 
of 
Governors 
of 
the 
U.S. 

Federal 
Reserve, 
previously 

served 
on 
President 
Barack 

Obama’s Council on Jobs and 
Competitiveness 
and 
worked 

on a long-term study for the 
National Academy of Science 
on the effects of the aging 
population in the United States.

During the talk, Ferguson 

said he sees Americans’ lack of 
fiscal knowledge as one of the 
most pressing issues facing the 
U.S. economy.

Thirty percent of Americans, 

when tested on their financial 
literacy, fell into the category of 

financially illiterate, Ferguson said.

“The state of financial literacy 

is 
abysmal,” 
he 
said. 
“The 

problem is that most parents 
are not very comfortable with 
finances, and therefore their 
kids are not comfortable. Adults 
in general aren’t comfortable, 
teachers are uncomfortable … So 
I think that there’s this general 
lack of financial awareness that 
permeates our society.”

The solution, he said, lies in 

education, citing work he’s doing 
with 15 graduate schools to try to

MACKINAC 
ISLAND 
— 

They came to Michigan, and 
they recited the usual platitudes 
Republicans in the state have 
been saying for at least the past 
27 years: 2016 is the year the 
GOP takes Michigan back in the 
presidential election.

Republicans haven’t won the 

state in a presidential election 
since 1988, but to the five GOP 
presidential 
candidates 
who 

came to Mackinac Island this 
weekend 
for 
a 
Republican 

leadership conference, it wasn’t 
just platitudes. They were high-
confidence predictions.

At a rally on the island, 

Sen. 
Ted 
Cruz 
(R–Texas) 

vowed to campaign hard in 
the state, promising a repeat 
of the Reagan Revolution — a 
reference to former President 
Ronald 
Reagan’s 
ability 
to 

attract Democratic voters, and 
the groundswell of support 
he found among Democrats in 
Macomb, Mich.

Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.), the 

winner of the weekend’s straw 
poll and a frequent visitor to the 
state, touted Michigan-focused 
policy — like his plan to return 
money to large urban areas like 
Detroit through what he calls 
“economic freedom zones.”

To reporters, he said he 

thought he’d be competitive 
in Michigan because of his 
positions on issues like Detroit 
and privacy, citing the NSA’s 
surveillance of cell phones 
through the Patriot Act.

“When you talk to college kids 

or you do a survey, let’s say even 
40 or under, 83 percent think we 
went way too far in collecting all 
the phone records,” he said. “And

The director of the Office 

of Student Conflict Resolution 
addressed members of Central 
Student 
Government 
on 

Tuesday 
amid 
an 
ongoing 

revision 
process 
for 
the 

Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities. 

Erik Wessel, the director, 

discussed ways student could 
contribute input during the 
revision. The statement outlines 
expectations 
for 
student 

conduct, and suggests sanctions 
and disciplinary procedures if 
they are not met.

The statement is amended 

every 
three 
years. 
Wessel 

said 
it 
was 
important 
for 

students 
to 
be 
actively 

involved in the amendment 
process, particularly because 
a 
University 
student 
is 

automatically 
bound 
the 

statement upon their enrollment 
at the University.

“The statement is best served 

when the entire community 
has a voice in its continued 
creation,” Wessel said, “My 
hope is that you will join me in 
that process.”

CSG’s 
Student 
Conduct 

Advisory Board is in charge of 
drafting the amended statement. 
They draft the statement based 
on 
conversations 
with 
the 

student body. The next forum 
will be held Oct. 1 at Weill Hall.

Wessel provided examples of 

the kinds of conflicts that may be 
addressed in the new statement, 
such as how the University 
handles students who enter 
buildings unauthorized, such as 
the Big House.

Remarks highlight 
opportunities for 
LSA students after 

graduation

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
setting 
was 

intimate 
Tuesday 
at 
the 

#withDeanMartin event held 

in the basement of Bursley 
Residence Hall.

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

hosted the open discussion 
Tuesday night, continuing a 
series of forums held last year.

The 
audience 
included 
a 

handful of freshmen as well 
as several dean ambassadors, 
the 
students 
who 
helped 

organize the event and work 
with Martin’s office over the 
year to engage with students as 
part of the Dean’s Ambassador 

Program.

The tone was informal, with 

questions ranging from study 
tips to the dean’s role at the 
University.

Martin 
emphasized 
the 

importance of taking advantage 
of LSA’s growing internship 
programs, and said his office 
was looking into opening a 
Opportunity Center to ensure 
students are aware of internship 
opportunities.

 $12 million 
allocated for 
North Campus 

building renovation 

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 10 years after 

disassembling 
its 
nuclear 

reactor, 
the 
University 
is 

allocating 
$12 
million 
to 

renovate 
the 
building 
and 

create a Nuclear Engineering 
Laboratory in the existing space.

The 
building 
was 
first 

created following World War 
II, as part of a project called 
the 
Michigan 
Memorial 

Phoenix Project. Its purpose 
was to honor members of the 
University who had died in the 
war, and was recognized by 
President Dwight Eisenhower 
as a facility for peaceful 
nuclear research.

Wessel 

said. “We want to have an

The new statement will go

Budget approval

CSG Treasurer Kevin Ziegler, 

a Business senior, presented 
the yearly CSG budget to the 
assembly.

The proposed budget would 

total 
$400,000. 
Currently 

CSG has an expected revenue 
$423,852.17, according to the 
budget report.

Ziegler said he hopes to keep 

the amount of general reserve 
— or unused — funds at a 
maximum of 5 percent. He said 
doing so would ensure students 
are still at the University when 
CSG uses the fees students 
pay each semester for student 
government.

“These fees that students 

are paying now — I want to see 
that money expended and put 
to use while they’re here at the 
University and in that semester,” 
Ziegler said.

According to the proposed 

budget, 
the 
Student 

Organization 
Funding 

Commission would receive 48 
percent of the funds for the year, 
totaling $167,592.28. 

Elections updates

Fall election dates were also 

proposed for Nov. 18 and 19.

A resolution introduced will 

permit a pay raise for the CSG 
elections director if the director 
holds his or her post for both 
semesters. The pay will remain 
$500 for the first semester, but 
will now increase to $750 for the 
second semester. 

The 
elections 
director 
is 

typically a Law student in charge 
of 
running 
CSG 
elections. 

Public Policy sophomore Jacob 
Pearlman, 
student 
general 

counsel, said the role demands 
an approximately eight week 
commitment.

Pearlman 
said 
previous 

directors experienced mental 
breakdowns due to the stresses 
of the position, and the funds are 
intended to provide additional 
incentive to fill the position.

Executive communications

LSA 
junior 
Sean 
Pitt, 

CSG’s chief of staff, discussed 
increasing 
communication 

between 
each 
of 
CSG’s 

commissions and the executive 
committee. 

Pitt proposed appointing a 

leader from each commision to 
report regularly to executive 
leadership.

Pitt also looks to decrease the 

number of CSG commissions 
from 19 to eight by turning 
certain former commissions into 
sub-commissions. For example, 
the Sexual Assault Commission 
will now fall under the umbrella 
of the Student Health and Safety 
Commission.

Pitt said the absorption of 

Sexual Assault into Student 
Health and Safety would not 
diminish 
the 
efficacy 
and 

importance of the commission, 
but would instead line up more 
CSG members behind the issue.

RACIAL TENSION AT USC

Student gov. president harassed

The University of South-

ern 
California’s 
student 

body president said she was 
harassed when a fraternity 
member yelled at her and 
threw a can of beer at her, 
the Los Angeles Times 
reported.

The president, Rini Sam-

path, was born in India. 
She said as she walked by 
the 
unnamed 
fraternity 

house, a man yelled out 
“You Indian piece of s---!”

When she was elect-

ed, Sampath became the 
first female USC student 
body president in nearly a 
decade and the first presi-
dent to be elected on an all 

female ticket.

Members of the frater-

nity apologized to Sam-
path after realizing who 
she was, but Sampath said 
the event left her unsettled 
because she thinks the 
fraternity 
member 
only 

apologized because of her 
position at the University.

Federal veterans’ pro-

gram cut at University 

of Iowa

The Iowa Consortium of 

Veteran Excellence, which 
provides about 600 Univer-
sity of Iowa student veter-
ans with programs to aid 

in the transition to college, 
will lose financial sup-
port from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Veteran Affairs 
by the end of September, 
The Daily Iowan reported 
Tuesday.

The VA allocated $2.2 

million in 2014 to both the 
university and the Iowa 
City Veteran Affairs Health 
Care System to develop the 
program. 

The Daily Iowan report-

ed that the cut came “with 
little explanation.” A Vet-

“Last summer we provided 

over a thousand internships to 
LSA students, and we awarded 
over a half million in scholarship 
money such that any student 
could 
take 
an 
internship 

regardless of need,” he said.

He also described how LSA 

was creating a name for itself 
among employers in various 
pre-professional fields, such as 
business.

“Just within the last month, 

we’re having employers who 
are calling our internship office 
saying we’ve had your LSA 
students 
with 
their 
history 

majors, econ majors, political 
science majors,” he said. “We 
want to come interview LSA 
students for jobs.”

In addition, he said taking 

advantage of the liberal arts 
experience helps prepare students 
for life after college, noting that 
94 percent of LSA students are 
employed or in graduate school six 
months after graduating.

Overall, Martin encouraged 

students to make the most of 
their time in the LSA.

“I’d 
pick 
whatever’s 
the 

most fun,” he said. “What’s the 
subject you find fascinating? 
That’s what you should chase 
after. And if you haven’t found 
that yet, keep looking.”

Martin said he plans on 

having two or three of these 
forums a semester at various 
locations around campus, as well 
as hosting open office hours once 
every three or four weeks.

“It’s really an opportunity for 

me to hear from students, and for 
us as a college to be responsive to 
whatever it is students want to 
talk about,” he said.

Social Work student Kendall 

Johnson, who is a graduate 
student adviser to the Dean’s 
Ambassador Program, said she 
considered the evening successful 
despite the small turnout.

“The fact that Dean Martin is 

trying to reach out to students 
is different from other deans,” 
Johnson said. “So I think that 
students are seeing that, and 
it’s just going to be a matter of 
continuing to get the word out.”

LSA senior Jason Colella, 

president 
of 
LSA 
student 

government, thought the smaller 
setting 
was 
an 
interesting 

variation on past events.

“This one was more intimate 

and on a smaller scale, which 
allowed us to have a more personal 
conversation,” Colella said. “We 
maybe got less of the policy ideas 
out of it, but we got more heart-
to-heart human reaction, which 
is a good perspective.”

Marjorie Horton, assistant 

dean 
for 
undergraduate 

education, 
said 
she 
hopes 

attendance is better in the future.

“I was disappointed that more 

first year students didn’t come 
because I think that it was really 
a very deliberate choice on Dean 
Martin’s part to come out to 
where the students live and be 
accessible,” Horton said.

She said she thinks working 

more closely with housing and 
involving residential advisors 
will expand the audience at 
future events.

The next of the dean’s forums 

will take place in Mary Markley 
Residence Hall on Oct. 29. A 
third forum is planned for Dec. 8 
in the Michigan Union. 

wife Betty donated $5 million 
of the total budget in 2012, 
which kicked off a subsequent 
fundraising 
campaign 
to 

renovate the nuclear facility.

The 
Nuclear 
Engineering 

Laboratory will function as a 
center for professors, researchers 
and 
students 
to 
continue 

research on topics like nuclear 
energy and advancements in 
power plant technology. The 
four-story building will contain, 
among other features, gamma 
ray testing centers and student 
collaboration rooms.

Ronald 
Gilgenbach, 
chair 

of the department of nuclear 
engineering 
and 
radiological 

sciences, 
said 
the 
lab 
will 

create a host of new research 
opportunities.

“This laboratory will make 

the world a safer place by 
developing new techniques and 
guiding policies to detect nuclear 
weapons materials,” he said.

Dean of Engineering David 

Munson, Jr., wrote in an e-mail 
to The Michigan Daily that the 

original building’s thick walls will 
make it a good location for nuclear 
research, as they were built to 
shield from radiation damage.

Munson added that one of the 

lab’s focus areas will be nuclear 
nonproliferation. He also noted 
that much of the research will be 
conducted by graduate students, 
with room for undergraduate 
research as well.

“The research in the new labs 

will be oriented at detection 
and 
imaging 
of 
radioactive 

sources, with applications to 
nuclear nonproliferation, and 
improvements to nuclear power 
plants,” Munson wrote. “The 
goal of the U-M work in that 
regard is to create improved 
means to detect and localize even 
small amounts of fissile material, 
which can be used to make 
nuclear bombs. The objective is 
to make it very difficult to hide 
this material or transport it 
across borders.”

Both Munson and Gilgenbach 

emphasized the need to continue 
important nuclear research in 
today’s society and said it will 
lead to nuclear energy being used 
in a safer way.

Engineering graduate student 

Marc Ruch, a nuclear engineering 
researcher, said part of working 
in the new facility will involve 
shining a more positive light on 
the potential of nuclear energy, as 
opposed to a sometimes negative 
connotation 
associated 
with 

nuclear power.

“Nuclear 
engineering 
is 

really the only solution to global 
warming. It’s a source of energy 
that’s 
economical 
without 

producing carbon emissions,” 
he said. “What this space, in 
particular, is going to be doing, 
at least for the lab that I work 
with, is help improve our ability 
to detect the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons as well.”

Similarly, Gilgenbach said 

the research on safe nuclear 
energy is a priority and will 
continue 
to 
be 
when 
the 

laboratory is complete.

“The research that we’re doing 

on nuclear thermal hydraulics 
will not only make nuclear 
energy safer, but it will allow us to 
improve the efficiency of nuclear 
reactors, since nuclear power is 
still the only carbon-free baseload 
energy that’s available that doesn’t 
rely on wind, sun or essentially 
hydroelectricity,” he said.

‘U’ names worker 
found dead in 
Chemistry Building

The man found dead in the 

University’s chemistry building 
on September 15 was identified 
on Tuesday as Lamont Smith, 
The Ann Arbor News reported.

Smith was found by a cowork-

er around 3:50 am in medical 
distress. 
When 
paramedics 

arrived he was pronounced dead 
on scene.

While the results of the 

autopsy have not been released 
yet, officials believe he died of 
natural causes.

Smith had worked as a custo-

dian with the University for 25 
years.

University continues 
campus ban on guns 
amid lawsuit

In August, Ann Arbor resident 

Josh Wade sued the University 
for the right to carry his gun on 
campus, the Detroit Free Press 
reported. 

The University filed a report 

to the state in defense of the 
ban this week. According to the 
University, under the Michigan 
Constitution schools do not have 
to abide by legislation concern-
ing weapons and they are thus 
allowed to ban guns on campus 
property.

Wade 
sparked 
controversy 

last spring when he demonstrat-
ed his right to open carry at an 
Ann Arbor High School choir 
concert. 

‘U’ Water Center 
receives $3 
million to conduct 
research on algae

Researchers from the University 

received a $3 million grant from 
the Erb Family Foundation to 
study the impact the Detroit 
River’s algea has on the blooms in 
Lake Erie.

The grant will last 3 years. 

Researchers will analyze the 
efficiency of Detroit’s “green 
infrastructure” projects which 
are created to maintain storm 
runoff in the city.

The algae, which plagues Lake 

Erie each year, release toxins into 
the water. When the toxins build 
up they make the water unsafe 
to drink. In August 2014, over 
400,000 inhabitants of Toledo 
were without drinking water as a 
resault of the algae.

Former state rep. 
outsted amid 
scandal is eligible 
to run again

Cindy Gamrat, former repre-

sentative for Michigan’s 80th 
district, will be eligible to run for 
her former seat, Michigan’s Sec-
retary of State ruled this week.

Gamrat was voted out of 

Michigan’s House of Represen-
tatives eariler this month after 
an investigation found she had 
misused state funds while hav-
ing an affair with former Rep-
resentative Todd Courser, who 
resigned the night she was voted 
out.

The scandal made national 

news. To prevent their affair 
from becoming public Courser 
sent an email claiming him to 
be addicted to pornography and 
seeking a male prostitute.

Courser and Gamrat have 

both filed to run for their former 
seats.

identify techniques which can 
be used to educate millennials 
on finances.

In particular, Ferguson said 

more education is required 
on saving for retirement. As 
the president of a retirement 
savings 
organization, 
he 

said he frequently interacts 
with individuals who are not 
thinking about it and are not 
saving enough — or even not 
saving at all.

“I think that the biggest 

problem can be just not thinking 
about it,” Ferguson said. “It’s 
been long said that people spend 
more time planning for vacation 
than their retirement.”

Ferguson listed three ways 

for businesses and organizations 
to maximize their employee’s 
retirement savings plans and 

encourage them to save. The 
first was to automatically enroll 
employees 
in 
a 
retirement 

savings plan so that instead of 
forgetting to sign up, they would 
have to unenroll if they did not 
want to participate.

His next suggestion was to 

implement automatic escalation, 
so that when an employee earns 
more money, a greater amount 
of earnings is also taken off their 
paycheck into their retirement 
plan. Finally, Ferguson said he 
wants companies to give their 
employees a chance to think about 
how the funds from the retirement 
plan will have to last them.

Though 
he 
acknowledged 

college 
students 
probably 

aren’t thinking about saving for 
retirement, he told the crowd 
they should be.

“For those of you who have 

loans, probably the first thing 
to do would be to resurface that 
debt and pay it off,” Ferguson 

said. “Plan to do both and 
sequence them properly.”

Ferguson, introduced at the 

talk as the top Black economist 
of his generation, also touched 
on diversity in the field of 
economics itself, saying he’d 
like to see more of it.

He said a combination of 

an 
intimidating 
intellectual 

environment, 
the 
types 
of 

research done within the field, 
and 
the 
math-based 
work 

might create an unappealing 
atmosphere for many students, 
but 
that 
students 
of 
all 

backgrounds should consider 
the profession.

“There are very few African 

American economists in my 
generation,” he said. “I think 
the real problem with the 
profession is that it is simply not 
diverse enough — be that race 
(or) gender. There’s something 
about the profession that is off-
putting for lots of people.”

being associated as one who wants 
to get rid of them I think helps 
me with the youth vote. Being a 
Detroit Republican, meaning I 
want to go after the minority vote 
and actually saying how I would 
do it, makes me different as well.”

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 

told attendees that the thought 
Michigan — as well as several 
other states that typically swing 
Democratic — were well within 
the GOP’s grasp, if the right 
nominee were elected.

“Everybody used to think that 

Michigan was a blue state,” he 
said. “Over and over again, you 
hear it, right? Well, Michigan, 
because 
of 
Republican 

leadership at the state level, 
isn’t blue anymore. It’s red. 
And at the national level, it’s 
purple trending red. And if we 
elect the right nominee, it’ll go 
Republican in November of next 
year. That’s just not idle chatter. 
That should be our aspiration.”

And 
it 
wasn’t 
just 
the 

candidates who thought so. State 
leadership and state Republicans 
in attendance in many ways 
led the charge in purveying 
this 
optimism, 
pointing 
to 

Michigan’s economy, the policy 
work of Gov. Rick Snyder and 
the control the state party 
has over both branches of the 
legislature, the governor’s office, 
the attorney general’s office and 
the secretary of state.

Citing the tenure of former 

Michigan 
Gov. 
Jennifer 

Granholm (D), Ronna Romney 
McDaniel, Michigan Republican 
Party chairman, said the state 
is doing well because of its 
Republican leadership, and that 
will resonate with voters in the 
presidential election.

“We 
have 
a 
story 
of 

Republican 
leadership 
and 

how it’s done,” she said. “Under 
Jennifer Granholm, jobs were 
fleeing our state. Our state was 
on the decline. I had friends 
lose homes. I had friends move 
away from the state, have to file 
bankruptcy, lose their jobs. And 
to see that people are coming 
back because Michigan has 
come back is a wonderful story.”

The theme of the conference 

— Michigan: Foundation for the 
Future — focused on that idea. 
There was plenty of attention 
focused on the prominence of 
Michigan in Washington, with 
panelists all weekend talking 
about how to take lessons 
learned in Michigan — like 
revitalization efforts in Detroit 
or initiatives to promote skilled 
trades — to the national stage.

After 
calling 
Washington, 

D.C. broken during a panel 
discussion, Snyder said many of 
Michigan’s successes could be 
replicated on a nationwide level.

“We’re a great country still, 

but we have a broken political 
culture,” Snyder said. “And it’s 
manifested in Washington more 
than anywhere else.”

Whether 
Republicans 
will 

actually 
take 
Michigan, 
of 

course, is a question that will 
be decided far into the future 
— especially with the current 
state of the GOP field, where the 
eventual nominee could be any of 
the 15 candidates still in the race.

But on whether the current 

optimism is warranted or not, 
history seems to suggest that it 
will be an uphill battle.

“Michigan has been like the 

holy grail for the Republican 
party since the 1990s,” said 
Political Science Prof. Michael 
Traugott. “But they haven’t 
really experienced much success. 
They probably are looking at 
the outcome of gubernatorial 
contests, and see how control 
of that office has switched back 
and forth between the parties. 
But the social agenda of recent 
Republican candidates hasn’t 
really matched very well with 
the social agenda of a majority of 
voters in the state of Michigan.”

Conference attendees cited 

multiple 
reasons 
for 
why 

they thought 2016 would be 
different, spanning from the 
candidates currently in the 
race to the current presidential 
administration and Michigan’s 
elected leaders.

“I think that’s a possibility, 

especially this year because I 
don’t see the Democrats have 
much to offer,” said Tom Banks, 
an Ypsilanti resident.

Banks, who said he currently 

favored retired neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson and Cruz in the race, 
added that he thought the pool 
of candidates for the Republican 
nomination was much stronger 
than it was in 2012.

“I see the Republicans have 16 

now really excellent candidates,” 
he said. “Any of them would be, I 
think, could be a winner. None of 
them are duds.”

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker 

has since supsended his campaign.

Tanner Wright, a sophomore 

at 
Hillsdale 
College 
who’s 

supporting Paul, said he thought 
Michigan would vote Republican 
based on public sentiment toward 
the Obama administration. 

“I mean, you can look back at 

the election of 1980, 1984, and 
you see that it goes red in those 
circumstances, when you have 
really unpopular Democrats — 
Jimmy Carter at the time — and 
you see a Republican win,” he said.

Sandi 
Holmes, 
an 
Auburn 

Hills resident who said she was 
favoring Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) 
or former Hewlett-Packard CEO 
Carly Fiorina, was more cautiously 
optimistic about the GOP’s chances.

“I’m hoping,” she said. “I think 

our candidates are great, we have 
a good selection. Hopefully the 
people will see that as well. And 
hopefully Republicans will vote.”

Linden resident Denise Graves 

said she thought if Michigan did 
vote Republican, it would be 
due in large part to Michigan’s 
Republican leadership.

“I think that’s very much of a 

possibility,” she said. “We have 
great candidates, and the climate 
here in Michigan is moving up, 
you’ve seen what we’ve done 
under the leadership now, with 
it being in Republican control. 
And I think what is happening 
in Michigan is what we need to 
happen all over the country.”

Graves said she thought a 

Rubio/Kasich ticket would be the 
party’s best chance of success.

Traugott said for some more 

moderate 
candidates 
such 

as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, 
Michigan could be a possibility, 
but that holding on to a moderate 
enough position through the 
primary would be difficult.

“It 
would 
increase 
the 

prospects for the Republican 
party to capture the state,” he 
said. “But under the new primary 
caucus system we’ve had since 
1976 … on the Republican side, 
in order to win the nomination, 
the candidates have had to take 
more and more conservative 
positions, and that comes back 
to haunt them in the general 
election. And you can see that 
in the posturing in the first two 
presidential debates.”

Romney 
McDaniel 

acknowledged that a Republican 
win in Michigan in 2016 would 
require hard work. But pointing 
to the number of candidates who 
have visited Michigan recently 
— 10 in the past six months — 
she said she thought momentum 
was building.

“We’re already seeing that 

energy around each of the 
candidates as they come into 
the state, and unfortunately, the 
Democrats — Hillary Clinton’s 
been here one time, really, since 
last October and that was only 
for a $500,000 fundraiser,” 
Romney McDaniel said. “She’s 
not interacting with Michigan 
voters, 
and 
Republican 

candidates are. We’re not taking 
for Michigan for granted. We 
know it’s going to be a heavier 
lift for us, presidentially, but 
we’re in play, and our candidates 
are showing that they’re taking 
Michigan seriously and they’re

“I 

see you.”

These three simple words uttered 

in the first 20 minutes of the movie 

“Beyond the Lights” pre-
vented a pop star from 
committing suicide. The 
film does not give a sophis-
ticated portrait of the 
dimensions and complexi-
ties of mental health, but 
there are notable aspects 
of the storyline.

The star of the movie is 

a multiracial, British-born 
singer named Noni Jean 
who was bred for success 
as a popular new Billboard 
Award Artist. The pressure of fame compelled 
her to end her life. In the moment Noni decides 
to fall to her fate, a police officer who “sees” 
beyond her Hollywood persona rescues her, 
and throughout the movie encourages her to 
find the beauty in her own voice, which ulti-
mately sets her free. 

Nina Simone’s song “Blackbird” is the under-

lying symbolic theme of the movie. The classic 
record metaphorically illustrates the resistance 
Black women face to define themselves in soci-
ety. Beginning in girlhood, women are incul-
cated to bind themselves in the cage of gender 
roles and norms through mannerisms, edu-
cational attainment and social advancements 
based on society’s norms and values. These 
definitive molds of what women should be 
intensify the daily challenges that life presents.

Black women are particularly susceptible to 

this additional challenge, and are unreason-
ably assumed with the responsibility of being 
strong for themselves and everyone around 
them. This leads to a catch-22 as Melissa Har-
ris-Perry notes in her book “Sister Citizen,” “On 
one hand, (the strong black woman) is a deeply 
empowering symbol of endurance and hope. 
Her courage in the face of seemingly insur-
mountable adversity emboldens black men and 
women when facing their own life challenges. 
But in her perfection, the strong black woman 
is also harmful. Her titanic strength does vio-
lence to the spirits of black women . . . When 
seeking help means showing unacceptable 
weakness, actual black women, unlike their 
mythical counterpart, face depression, anxiety, 

and loneliness.”

There’s an inadequate discussion about men-

tal health in America, particularly within com-
munities of color. In Black culture, being strong 
is the only way to survive. African Americans 
have had to survive slavery, segregation, mass 
incarceration and police/vigilante terrorism. 
Black communities have a history of negative 
experiences with the health care industry, 
largely due to the abuse of Black bodies for 
medical studies and experimentation.

Heinous examples of such abuses include the 

Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the Dow Chemical 
testing of carcinogens on (mostly Black) pris-
oners and using Black cancer patients to deter-
mine whether U.S. soldiers could survive a 
nuclear catastrophe during the Cold War. This 
exploitation and violence has lead to mistrust 
in medical authorities, because more often than 
not, these authorities don’t have Black people’s 
best interests at heart. To fill this void, Black 
people often share their burdens with their 
family members, friends and spiritual leaders. 
Yet it’s still all too uncommon for us to openly 
name any difficulties with mental health.

Mental health problems manifest them-

selves in many forms: anxiety, low self-esteem, 
ADHD, alcohol/drug abuse, suicide, post-
traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorders 
and eating disorders, just to name a few. Any 
of these disorders can be caused by biological, 
environmental or psychological factors. To the 
detriment of communities of color, politically 
induced environmental factors such as unem-
ployment, lack of quality education and vio-
lence are additional external stressors that can 
trigger mental health disorders.

Too many people are suffering. According 

to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration in 2012, an estimated 
18.6 percent of African Americans, 28.3 per-
cent of American Indians, 13.9 percent of Asian 
Americans, and 16.3 percent of Latinos report-
ed experiencing mental illness in the past year. 
Too many people are hurting themselves and 
hurting others as a result of not obtaining the 
help they need.

There’s an absence of substantive discus-

sions around mental illness, and if the discus-
sion does surface, it seems to only be when 
major tragedies take place. More often that 
not, white people who perpetuate actions of

Only 12 of you know who I am

It isn’t too often that I get to be 

a fan of the person and not just the 
personality, but sometimes, stars 
really are just like us.

Whenever I discover that a 

talented artist whom I admire for his 
or her professional accomplishments 
is 
in 
long-term 
recovery 
from 

drug and alcohol addiction, I gain 
this newfound sense of kindred 
spiritedness.

Like Martin Sheen, whom I 

grew to adore on “The West Wing” 
long before I had my first blackout 
episode. 
Like 
Matthew 
Perry, 

whom I was crushing on during 
the reign of “Friends” years prior 
to my first encounter with the legal 
consequences as a result of my 
alcohol use.

You know them as the fictional 

President 
Josiah 
Bartlet 
and 

Chandler Bing, respectively, but did 
you know that they are — in reality 
— people in long-term recovery who 
use their notoriety to advocate for 
generations of others afflicted with 
addiction and in need of treatment, 
not jail cells?

Well, now you do.
Celebrity certainly helps to gain 

a captive audience, but thankfully, 
you don’t have to be an award-
winning actor — or a comic book 
superhero — to be an influential 
individual when it comes to long-
term recovery. To make your mark 
on this movement, all it requires is 
mustering the courage to do one 
simple thing: speak up.

Especially when it’s the White 

House asking.

This September marks the 25th 

celebration of National Recovery 
Month, a campaign designed to 
spread awareness about substance 
abuse disorders and other mental 
illnesses that devastate our country 
— a plague that’s strengthened by 
inappropriate shame and social 
stigma, which in turn, perpetuates 
millions of vows of silence.

Last Thursday was a ground-

breaking day in our country’s 
history when an intimate group of 
young people in long-term recovery 
from drug and alcohol addiction 
gathered at our nation’s most 
sacred building in Washington, 
D.C., to discuss the great shift that’s 
happening within our culture: 
“Recovering out loud. No shame. 
Only pride.”

One of the members of the panel, 

which was streamed live, was the 

University’s own Ariel Britt, a 
graduate student in the School of 
Social Work and an intern for the 
Collegiate Recovery Program, led by 
program manager Matt Statman.

I’ve gotten to know “Air,” as she’s 

called, through my own involvement 
with our CRP and Students for 
Recovery, the student-run sister 
organization, and if you asked me to 
tell you one thing about her, I’d tell 
you that she’s always smiling. That’s 
what I think of when I think of Air: 
Cheerful. Vivacious. Full of life.

But it wasn’t always that way, and 

when I asked her to share her story 
for this piece, obviously, Air was 
more than willing.

Her addiction tore her away 

from her undergraduate education 
here at the University. In search of 
a geographical cure, Air retreated 
to Brooklyn, N.Y., hoping time 
away from a college environment 
— a beyond-hostile atmosphere for 
anyone (of any age) who’s trying to 
stay sober — might bode well for her.

Thankfully, Air found recovery 

and built a support community in 
the city, but after a while, she felt 
stagnant. She knew she wanted 
to return to Ann Arbor to finish 
her degree, but she was hesitant 
to reacquaint herself with such a 
triggering world, full of such dark 
memories.

“It was tough just to walk by 

bushes where I used to throw up,” 
she admitted to me, and I understood 
completely. I had the same feelings 
when I twice had to push the 
pause button on my academic 
and professional journey to seek 
rehabilitation — knowing full well 
the kind of toxic arena to which I’d 
eventually have to return if I wanted 
to finish my degree.

It seemed impossible…
But then came the CRP, and it 

commenced during the same winter 
term when Air moved back to Ann 
Arbor. She got connected with Matt, 
and all of her fears about having to 
leave campus in order to rebuild a 
support community vanished. The 
CRP works diligently to provide 
students in recovery with social 
opportunities that aren’t mired in 
drugs and alcohol — a serious rarity 
on campus — like tailgates, ice 
skating at Yost arena, camping trips 
and volunteer efforts. 

And now, as Air nears graduation 

this December, she wants to use 
her master’s degree to continue 

crusading for this cause within 
educational institutions across the 
country as a fearless advocate for 
current and future college students 
who need recovery support.

On top of everything else, Air 

works as a manager for a sober living 
house managed by the local Dawn 
Farm treatment center.

“Bottom line, people are dying 

and not receiving the services 
they need because this movement 
is so underground,” she told me, 
citing the recent documentary The 
Anonymous People as a huge source 
of inspiration. “And you shouldn’t 
have to leave school to get the help 
you need. This is an issue of social 
justice above all else.”

I have no doubt that people whose 

lives have been personally impacted 
by the disease of addiction — from 
Martin Sheen and Matthew Perry to 
Matt Statman and Ariel Britt — will 
continue to speak up in the name 
of life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness for every member of this 
country whose existence has been 
marginalized by this disease, and 
the White House ain’t a bad place to 
“start chatting.”

Recovery from addiction isn’t the 

modern scarlet letter. It’s a badge of 
honor, and I keep mine pinned to my 
chest because we need to illuminate 
the solution just as frequently as we 
broadcast the problem. For every 
story on a heroin overdose, let’s 
feature a story about a collegiate 
recovery program that might have 
saved that person’s life. For every 
funeral, let’s celebrate a sobriety 
milestone in honor of someone who 
wasn’t as fortunate.

The devastation has its important 

place. We can’t dampen or quash 
the seriousness of this health crisis, 
and there’s a reason why one of 
my tattoos reads in bold, black ink, 
“Scars are souvenirs you never lose. 
The past is never far.”

Let’s not forget the stark truth that 

addiction is a matter of life or death.

But let’s not forget about life. 

Let’s not forget that there’s hope. 
Let’s not forget that continuous, 
uninterrupted sobriety — even 
in college — is possible when the 
support is there both tangibly 
and through social and political 
empowerment.

Let us never forget that recovery 

is a reality.

Carley Keyes is an LSA senior.

I 

’m Zach Ackerman. I’m an LSA senior 
and a townie, and come November, it’s 
likely I will represent about 9,000 Ann 

Arbor residents on the 
City Council. While 9,000 
of you live in my ward, 
based on the poll numbers, 
it looks like only about 12 
of you voted during the 
August primaries.

Now, I have no intention of taking you on a 

lengthy guilt trip. There are real institutional 
barriers keeping young voices out of the pro-
cess. By way of example, the student popula-
tion is split amongst all five of Ann Arbor’s 
wards, diluting the impact of the young vote. 
And, perhaps most importantly, the deciding 
vote in Ann Arbor is usually the Democratic 
primary in August — I’m running unopposed 
in November’s general election — when only 
one in 10 students are enrolled in classes at 
the University.

The result is a much older voting popula-

tion, one with a median age of 61 years and 
an incredibly high level of engagement. Gov-
ernment moves really slowly, and most of our 
peers will only spend four short years living 
in Ann Arbor. But our alumni tend to move to 
cities — more than 56,000 in Metro Detroit, 
23,000 in Chicago and 13,200 in New York.

So instead of spending these next 500 

words trying to convince you to vote next 
August, I’ll instead encourage you to engage 
in the local discourse of any community you 
find yourself in.

While your city council will likely never 

declare war or pass an international trade 
deal, cities wield tremendous power and 
leverage a lot of resources. For example, the 
United States’ three largest port cities alone 
dominate a 622.3 million tonnage shipping 
industry, an industry that, in turn, dominates 
the American economy.

City governments across the country affect 

everything from the ease of your commute to 
the price of a gallon of gas. The returns on 
investment in local government are the most 
authentic you will ever see from any type of 
government. Ten million dollars will pave 
17 miles of road, or build an entire neighbor-
hood of mixed-income affordable housing. 

Whether you’re a state’s-rights libertarian 
or progressive liberal, there’s a strong case 
for investment in local government. And, no 
matter where you live, local government is 
going to exist.

But for at least four years, you will live 

here. Your life will impact the community 
and the community will doubtlessly impact 
your life. So instead, I will take these last 
200 words to try to convince you to vote 
 

next August.

Every month, when you cut your rent 

check, you contribute to the city’s $380 mil-
lion annual operating budget. That’s a clear 
financial stake in the health of Ann Arbor if 
nothing else. I don’t have a student agenda, 
but I want to help Ann Arbor remain fiscally, 
economically and environmentally sustain-
able well into this century. And I believe most 
students want to see the same, whether they 
think about it or not.

We are the young of this city and often the 

heaviest users of our downtown. A vibrant 
downtown is something we all want. But how 
do we build it at a price tag accessible to all 
of us?

Every winter, our roads fall apart, and 

come April we’re reluctantly repairing bent 
rims and flat tires. How do we fill our pot-
holes in a state that spends less per capita on 
roads than any other in the union?

Each day, tens of thousands of students 

will hop on a Michigan bus to get to and from 
class. How can the city and the University 
build a public transit system that decreases 
traffic congestion and our surprisingly large 
negative impact on the environment?

These are only four of the thousands of 

issues that our municipal government tackles 
every day. Each issue is incredibly complex 
and will likely take decades to fully address, 
but each will only be addressed if there exists 
a passionate and dedicated citizenry — one 
made up of all ages.

Whether you’re an Ann Arbor resident for 

four years or for life, I encourage you to voice 
your concerns, write your City Council repre-
sentative, and let me be your friend.

Recovery is a reality

mass violence are viewed as victims 
of mental health disorders, as if their 
violent acts were justified from hav-
ing an impaired state of mind.

When Adam Lanza took the lives 

of 20 children at Sandy Hook Ele-
mentary School, the media wanted to 
attribute Lanza’s horrendous act to a 
history of psychological or emotional 
disturbance. In contrast, Shannon J. 
Miles, a Black man with a history of 
mental illness who is being charged 
with capital murder for killing a sub-
urban Houston police officer, is vili-
fied without question, and met with 
the unwarranted campaign of “cops’ 
lives matter.”

If only someone had seen the 

signs early on. If only someone had 
paid attention. If only the phrases, “I 
hear you. I feel you. I see you,” were 
enunciated genuinely, we could save 
someone we care about from taking 
someone else’s life, or even their own. 
It isn’t normal to think about killing 
yourself or killing someone. But it’s 

becoming all too common.

What can we do? Connect with one 

another to find the approaches that 
work best. Increase access to therapy 
and medication, while being mindful 
that not everyone may need a thera-
pist or medication. A friend, fam-
ily member, mentor, religious leader, 
teacher or anyone else can serve as 
an emotional support system. It takes 
courage to admit our shortcomings 
that seemingly marginalize our-
selves, but we all are more alike than 
we are different. Everyone experi-
ences stress; how we respond to it 
differs.

It’s time to start talking about 

mental health. It’s time to encour-
age more Black Americans to talk 
with psychologists, and become 
psychologists themselves. It’s time 
to demand cultural competency 
training for our mental health pro-
fessionals. Mental health services 
need to adapt to communities of 
color and ensure that the services 

and treatment are accessible, both 
in terms of proximity of providers 
to communities of color and costs. 
It’s time to speak up when we notice 
something. 

Symbolically, 
blackbirds 
are 

known for having an acute sense of 
awareness and ability to use their 
senses. They’re mysterious and 
serious, and demand devotion and 
commitment before sharing their 
secrets. Maybe you know a black-
bird that exhibits these characteris-
tics. A blackbird may find it difficult 
to share their struggle because the 
world has told them it’s either flight 
or fight, and the blackbird cannot 
manage either one. It’s important to 
spot these blackbirds, so that they 
may receive the help, encourage-
ment and love they need to fly. Then, 
everyone can really see the beauty 
they bring to the world.

T

he Hungarian film 
“White God” begins with 
an aerial shot of a vast 

and empty city. The only figure, 
barely visible, rides a bike. The 
silence is 
unnerving 
— where is 
everyone? It’s 
the setup for 
some kind of 
fairytale or 
post-apoca-
lyptic story of 
survival. The 
camera moves 
in; the figure 
is a teenage 
girl, probably 
13 years old. She rides across a 
bridge into the heart of Budapest 
as the wind blows gently. The 
camera zooms onto the pedals of 
the bike, capturing her cycling 
in slow motion — movement, 
forward progress. But then an 
orchestra erupts in symphonic 
malaise. The girl turns to see 
a deluge of wild dogs, 250 of 
them, hustling down the street, 
growling, angry. They are gain-
ing on her. As the girl passes an 
intersection, the camera rests 
barely a foot off the ground as it 
captures the flood of dogs sprint 
by. Cut to black. Director Kornel 
Mundruczo has moved us from 
the sky to the ground; we have 
fallen from grace.

This two-and-a-half-minute 

sequence is perhaps the best in 
film I’ve seen this year. It tells 
us most everything we need 
to know — not so much about 
the story itself, but about the 
emotional stakes in which we 
are about to invest ourselves. 
Mundruczo’s film is indeed a 
fairytale, a particularly sad one 
at that — a tale of lost innocence 
and 
oppression 
and 
anger, 

devoid of a happy ending.

“White God,” which recently 

dropped on Netflix, recounts 
the tale of Hagen, a mixed-
breed dog, as he devolves from 
a loving house pet into a killer, 
transformed by a society that 
sees him as a dirty less-than. 
The 
Hungarian 
government 

has laws against non-purebred 
animals, and Hagen’s owner, 
Lili, the cyclist, is forced to 
give him up to the streets. 
The metaphor becomes quite 
clear; Hagen and other mutts 
represent 
the 
lower 
class 

shunned by society. Eventually, 
Hagen, about to be put down 
by the pound, leads the other 
impounded dogs to rise up 
against their oppressors. They 
take the city, killing those who 
have abused them.

If 
the 
film 
sounds 
like 

“Battleship Potemkin” by way 
of “Babe: Pig in the City,” it 
is. The premise may be a bit 
ridiculous and the allegory 
rather heavy-handed, but the 
film generally works as a series 
of dreamlike images, effectively 
staged 
and 
featuring 
some 

of the best acting by animals 
I’ve ever seen. In addition, it 

draws its principle strength in 
how Mundruczo frames the 
characters and animals.

If we view a camera as 

a pair of eyes — our eyes — 
then when the camera looks 
down at something, a dog for 
example, the dog has no power 
because we stand above it, 
claiming positional dominance. 
However, if the camera points 
upward at the dog, then the dog 
claims the power— we feel its 
size overpowering us. This is 
really the one that Mundruczo 
expresses with the opening 
sequence: the audience begins 
with power, which diminishes 
by the end, trampled by the 
stampede.

Mundruczo, for the first 

two-thirds of the film, slowly 
but surely moves the camera 
lower and lower in framing 
Hagen. By the time Hagen 
has broken, tapped into his 
heart of darkness at the behest 
of a number of cruel owners 
(among them a dog fighter 
who pounds the animal into a 
fighting machine), the camera 
sits beneath him. He takes the 
power from the audience, the 
rest of society that has beat him 
down, and fights back.

The position of the camera 

further 
suggests 
where 

Mundruczo expects society to 
go to combat the lack of regard 
for the lesser class: are we to 
ascend higher and see the world 
for what it truly is or descend 
into the dirt? We really only 
have two options: higher or 
lower, better or worse.

“White 
God” 
parallels 

another 
recent 
film 
about 

class strug. Bong Joon-ho’s 
“Snowpiercer” operates on a 
similar, though more nuanced, 
level about the world, but 
instead contracts the Universe 
into the closed walls of a train. 
In a train that shelters the 
only survivors of a devastating 
global freeze, there isn’t really 
space to move higher or lower, 
so instead it remains at the eye 
level of Curtis, the leader of the 
rebellion. The camera, then, can 
only move in a lateral direction: 
forward or backward, forward, 
being to the front of the train, 
where the upper classes reside, 
and the back, with the leftover 
lower class.

Like 
the 
camera, 
Curtis 

and the rebellion can only 
move forward or backward, 
progress toward the front to 
make the engine fall back in 
line, 
taking 
the 
oppression 

to which they have become 

accustomed. Joon-ho mirrors 
this limited thinking through 
Curtis’s decision-making, as he 
hesitates to move backward or 
forward, ultimately choosing 
to move forward, always at 
the cost of friends that have 
served as his conscience and 
grounded him. This way of 
staging, forward or backward, 
right or left, always results in 
death and destruction; the push 
forward, even if it seems just, 
is still just as costly, physically 
and through the goodness of 
the minds of those bodies.

But 
then, 
at 
almost 
94 

minutes in, Joon-ho introduces 
a 
third 
direction: 
out. 
As 

Namgoong, 
the 
security 

specialist, explains that he does 
not want to take the engine but 
to break outside of the train, the 
camera very deliberately and 
slowly pivots a full 90 degrees, 
the only time it has moved in 
this fashion. Suddenly, this 
space is not one dimensional; 
Curtis can move forward or 
backward and perpetuate the 
cycle of violence, or he can 
end it completely by breaking 
outside. And it is this third 
option that Curtis ultimately 
chooses, 
opting 
to 
derail 

the train, killing all but two 
children, who are able to begin 
society anew, untainted by the 
adults that formed it.

Joon-ho ends his saga on an 

optimistic note: a shot of a polar 
bear, thought to be extinct, 
suggesting that the children 
will survive and perhaps thrive. 
For Mundruczo, the ending is 
less positive. He takes us back 
to the sky for a shot of all of the 
dogs, Lili and her father lying 
on the ground, humans nearly 
indistinguishable 
from 
the 

dogs. The police will soon come, 
and the dogs will likely be shot. 
For a moment, there is peace and 
similarity and understanding, 
but not for much longer.

And so we see a difference 

in ideology between these two 
directors. Joon-ho has taken us 
forward and backwards, only 
to abandon the two altogether 
and move outside. Mundruczo 
has taken us up and down and 
then back up to see the world 
with 
newfound 
awareness. 

Whichever is correct will have 
to be left to the viewer, but it is 
clear that both directors have 
used their cameras to deliver 
a message: we have shown you 
the world, now what will you do 
about it?

Mac Miller does 
his best work yet

ALBUM REVIEW

Miller finally gets 
serious on his latest 

release

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

Ah, 2015: the gift that keeps on 

giving. The number of fantastic 
hip-hop releases this year has 
already become 
dizzying. 
Without 
even 

attempting 
to 
make 
a 

comprehensive 
list, 
Drake, 

A$AP 
Rocky, 

Kendrick 
Lamar, 
Earl 

Sweatshirt, 
Young 
Thug, 
Vince 
Staples, 

Future and Chief Keef have all 
dropped outstanding albums in 
the past nine months. What’s 
most remarkable, however, is the 
emergence of artists that basically 
had no right to be taken seriously. 

Mac Miller entered the rap game 

as a white, Jewish lacrosse player 
from the suburbs of Pittsburgh and 
spent years meddling with frat-rap 
before becoming a reclusive drug 
addict. While his more traditional 
fans were likely turned off by his 
psilocybin-infused projects like 
Faces and Delusional Thomas, 
it seems that Mac’s drug-fueled 
chamber of reflection has emerged 
stronger than ever before. GO:OD 
AM is undoubtedly his best work 
yet, and he knows it.

“When In Rome” sees Mac lit-

erally beat his chest and yell, “I’M 
AT THE TOP OF MY GAME.” At 
that moment, he hits a peak that 
he’s never hit before. You get the 
sense that this is his magnum 
opus. For the first time in, well, 
ever, Mac spits with the highest 
order of conviction. The drug-
induced self-doubt and confusion 
that characterized much of his 
earlier work has given way to a 
more pure, clear-headed sense of 
direction and hunger that aligns 
with the development of fellow 

“most improved rappers” like Big 
Sean and Tyler, The Creator. Mac 
used Faces to announce that he 
didn’t care if his next high was his 
last (word to Amy Winehouse), 
but on album-opener “Brand 
Name,” he prays he doesn’t join 
the infamous 27 Club. This is a 
changed man.

“Brand Name,” featuring some 

of the most lush production this 
year, sets the tone for the rest of 
the album. Mac’s turned into the 
type of guy that takes pride in his 
extreme work ethic, à la Kanye 
West, and it comes through with 
lines like “I work harder than 
anybody you know / I’m done 
with tricks, don’t need no money 
to blow.” The aim isn’t mak-
ing “Forbes 30 Under 30” on his 
major-label debut; he is focused 
on his craft.

Mac’s 
self-awareness 
on 

GO:OD AM highlights his con-
stant emphasis on building a 
personal narrative. “Back when 
I first made 100 grand … thought 
I was the shit” on “100 Grand-
kids” spins some humor into his 
very serious development from 
a “teen rapper” to a composed, 
legitimate artist. He’s been in 
the game for so long that we tend 
to forget how young he is: only 
23. He was 19 when the video 

for “Donald Trump” came out 
and shot him to suburban fame 
from coast to coast. On the latter 
half of “100 Grandkids,” a wom-
an’s voice annoyingly weaves 
between left and right channels, 
murmuring “Lemme get some 
money …” and for a moment, we 
can understand what it feels like 
to have leeches at our necks for a 
substantial part of our adolescent 
and artistic development.

If anything captures Malcom’s 

newfound wisdom, it’s the Lil B 
feature on “Time Flies.” BasedGod 
himself makes a fleeting appear-
ance to drop some delectable based 
interludes. “Watch as time goes, 
time moves, time flow. How do we 
handle these things? I am time, 
we are time, and we have control.” 
Again, the four years separating 
Mac from “Donald Trump” have 
been an absolute rollercoaster 
through DatPiff fame, psyche-
delic reflection and finally a poised 
adulthood. He’s handled the grow-
ing pains of his career rather admi-
rably for a millennial tossed in the 
deep end, sharpening his creative 
vision and fending off “white rap-
per” stigmas along the way. More 
so than any of his other projects, 
GO:OD AM is Mac’s strongest 
claim that maybe we should start 
taking him seriously.

Stunning ‘Grandma’

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

When visiting an old friend, Elle 

Reid (Lily Tomlin, “I Heart Huck-
abees”) jokes that his many remar-
riages have made 
him a patriarch. 
But one look at 
the wine-stained 
stacks of feminist 
literature litter-
ing her household 
and you know 
“Grandma” 
is 

nothing 
other 

than the highest of matriarchs. 
Filled with the wisdom of age and 
the fire of youth, Elle’s brassy wit 
and progressive attitude command 
attention and place her at the cen-
ter of her family’s orbit.

 So when her teenage grand-

daughter Sage (Julia Garner, “Elec-
trick Children”) gets pregnant, it’s 
Elle’s door she comes knocking 
at for abortion money. Bad news: 
despite a once-prestigious writ-
ing career, Elle’s broke too. A 1955 
Dodge Royal takes them to Elle’s 
acquaintances all over town in an 
effort to pony up the cash. Equal 
parts laugh-out-loud funny and 
heart-wrenchingly 
poignant, 

Tomlin’s skillful performance sets 
the tone for the rest of the film.

 Clocking in at barely 80 minutes 

— a sprint among stamina-testing 
Oscar contenders (and this does 
deserve to be an Oscar contender) — 
“Grandma” boasts an impressively 
economical use of screen time. 
In a sense, the structure takes 
on Elle’s attitude toward life. 
Rather than wasting time wading 
through past narrative, it hits the 
ground running. The opening 
scene ushers us in right in the 
heat of Elle’s breakup with her 
girlfriend, without even leaving 
time to explain what, exactly, 
initiated the argument. Every 
character introduction thereafter 

seems to come in medias res, so 
it’s the dialogue-heavy character 
interactions that drop just enough 
context clues for the viewer to 
stitch 
together 
the 
extensive 

backstories. What’s so amazing 
about this is that we get to learn 
about the past in a way that also 
propels 
the 
current 
situation 

forward in one fell swoop.

 The most notable use of this 

dialogue style is in Tomlin’s scene 
with Sam Elliott (“The Big Leb-
owski”), where Elle’s persistence 
pulls feelings of nostalgia, hesita-
tion, reluctance, tenderness and 
hurt out of the both of them. The 
course of an entire relationship, 
from its peak to eventual down-
fall and the loose ends afterward, 
is revealed in just two lines that 
don’t even explicitly state informa-
tion, just the characters’ present 
emotions. And it’s not just scenes 
with Elliott that get this treat-
ment: every one of the supporting 
characters maximizes their time 
on screen, showcasing their talent 
and revealing remarkable depth 
about their personal history.

 On a media representation level, 

“Grandma” is as progressive as 

Elle herself. For starters, it’s one of 
the very few movies featuring teen 
pregnancy in which the character 
actually goes through with the 
abortion (the only other one 
that comes to mind immediately 
is “Obvious Child) and has it 
portrayed as a reasonable option. 
While it’s not the media’s job to 
take one political stance over 
another, it is important that it 
represent real decisions that real 
people make, and not selectively. 
Also, it treat’s Elle’s sexuality as 
something 
completely 
normal, 

focusing on the story behind her 
relationships 
rather 
than 
the 

gender of her partners.

 Honestly, every aspect of the 

entire film is spectacular, from 
the naturalistic camera work 
to the restrained use of a sweet 
soundtrack — the type that makes 
you smile out of love for life and 
everything in it. But the cherry 
on top of an already teetering 
mountain of cherries is the dia-
logue, written with subtle but with 
alarming complexity and executed 
in the same fashion, making it one 
of the best films —if not the best — 
of 2015 thus far.

NPH dazzles, but 
‘Best Time’ flops

Unoriginal NBC 

variety show fails to 
showcase its talent 

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

The live variety show has its 

roots in television’s earliest days. 
Milton Berle earned his moniker 
“Mr. 
Televi-

sion” on “Texaco 
Star 
Theater,” 

while shows like 
“Saturday Night 
Live” 
continue 

the tradition into 
the present.

There’s 
a 

multi-layered 
appeal to these 
series. The vari-
ety show itself 
harkens 
back 

to the days of 
vaudeville, an influence on the 
earliest forms of film exhibition – 
several short skits and attractions, 
played separately, under one roof. 
In a way, the variety show is a win-
dow reaching back to the begin-
nings of an art form.

Coupling this sentimentality is 

the risk of performing the show 
live. The idea that “anything can 
happen” adds a degree of excited 
uncertainty and morbid curiosity 
to the viewing experience. While 
preparation 
prevents 
mishaps, 

there’s the chance of spontaneity 
in the experience as viewers across 
the country share in the experi-
ence of watching something live.

“Best Time Ever With Neil Pat-

rick Harris,” fails to live up to its 
spiritual predecessors, crafting a 
bland and stilted final product that 
is the exact opposite of its title.

In recent years, Harris (“How 

I Met Your Mother”) has proven 
himself a hosting juggernaut, with 
turns at helming the Tonys, Emmys 
and Oscars award shows earn-
ing the multi-talented performer 
generally strong reviews (with a 
few exceptions). “Best Time Ever” 
looks to utilize Harris’s skills as an 

entertainer, making him the linch-
pin for almost every section of the 
show, as Harris sings, climbs and 
pogo-sticks his way through the 
hour. However, most of these seg-
ments feel laboriously long, to the 
point where Harris’s energy seems 
drained.

What makes these elements so 

trying is the stiff nature of events 
that are supposed to be spontane-
ous – for example, Harris’s interac-
tions with celebrity guests. Reese 
Witherspoon (“Wild”) serves as 
the premiere’s guest announcer 
and the majority of her “banter” 
with Harris is so pre-packaged, it’s 
nearly impossible to find any genu-
ine ingredients within it.

The same goes for Nicole Scher-

zinger, whose involvement would 
be exciting if The Pussycat Dolls 
were still a thing, which they 
aren’t. When the singer announces 
the segment “Neil vs. Everyone,” 
the poor attempts at humor stick 
out like a sore thumb, as even the 
studio audience can’t muster a 
laugh.

Furthermore, 
the 
pre-taped 

portions need improvement. Con-
sisting mostly of Harris dressing 
up in a manner of disguises, these 
parts of the show bring some 
amusement but are never laugh-
out-loud funny. The bigger issue 
is the toll these have on the live 
element of the show. These bits of 
ready-made material don’t stand 
out, they actively detract from the 
show, feeling like filler as they pad 

out the hour. Meanwhile, NBC 
never misses a chance to promote 
corporate synergy during these 
sections by having Harris, in the 
guise of a clueless Austrian televi-
sion host, interview the judges of 
“The Voice.”

From a technical standpoint, 

the show operates mostly without 
a hitch, but some missed opportu-
nities reveal mismanaged direc-
tion. Most glaringly is the end of 
“Neil vs. Everyone,” when Har-
ris, racing against Witherspoon 
on a towering obstacle course, is 
about to finish. He grabs onto the 
zip line and begins to slide down, 
headed for victory. However, the 
camera decides to turn its atten-
tion to Witherspoon as she begins 
to mount the zip line, completely 
missing Harris crossing the finish 
line and the subsequent victory 
explosions.

It’s a shame because the inten-

tions of the show at least seem 
well-placed. The games select 
audience members and viewers 
at home can play for prizes are 
easy enough that most can win. 
Harris seems game for anything, 
made evident in the big end of the 
show performance; he obviously 
wants people to have the “best 
time ever.” But, unfortunately the 
execution fails its host as the show 
mostly slogs through its runtime, 
occasionally throwing stuff at 
the screen randomly, like Carrot 
Top, in an attempt to reinvigorate 
excitement that is already gone.

“And this is how your mother left me.”

Re-release previews 
Murakami’s success

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

Haruki 
Murakami 
almost 

didn’t exist.

That is, international bestsell-

ing and prize-
winning novelist 
Haruki Muraka-
mi almost didn’t 
exist. 
Without 

the crack of a 
baseball bat, he 
might have never 
written a novel 
at all. As he notes 
in the preface of 
“Wind/Pinball,” 
a fascinating and 
insightful look into his career and 
creative process, the sound of Dave 
Hilton’s double in a game between 
the Yakult Swallows and Hiroshi-
ma Carp awoke the latent novelist 
inside him: “In that instant, for no 
reason and based on no grounds 
whatsoever, it suddenly struck me: 
I think I can write a novel.”

This novel would become “Hear 

the Wind Sing,” which, strangely 
enough, he started writing in Eng-
lish. He wrote only one hard copy 
of his first novella and sent it to 
Japanese literary journal Gunzo, 
where they awarded it the Gunzo 
Literature prize. Without this 
success, Murakami says he likely 
would have never written any-
thing else.

Collected 
with 
his 
second 

novel “Pinball, 1973,” “Hear the 
Wind Sing” is now widely avail-
able in English for the first time 
in the volume “Wind/Pinball.” 
Murakami litters his novels with 
oddities. His narrator dates a nine-
fingered girl, has dreams about 
Trotsky’s reindeer, fucks on top of 

the Sunday Edition of a newspaper, 
becomes obsessed with a pinball 
machine — but fails to gather them 
into a coherent whole. However, 
Murakami is not a man to fetishize 
unity. And his apprentice novellas, 
like his later work, defy expecta-
tions of the realist novel.

“Hear the Wind Sing” practi-

cally has no plot. The anonymous 
narrator and his friend The Rat 
— and everyone in “Wind/Pin-
ball” who is either nameless or 
has a nickname — travel through 
typical collegiate peregrinations 
of alienation and banality. They 
spend most of their days trying 
fastidiously to become alcoholics, 
engaging in fruitless sexual rela-
tionships (one of the narrator’s 
ex-girlfriends kills herself, and the 
more successful encounters end 
in post-coital notes saying, “Ass-
hole”). They also listen to records 
from the West — name-dropping 
so many Western ephemera that 
one forgets the novel takes place in 
Tokyo — and read classic works of 
literature.

Murakami’s narrator is perfect-

ly inauthentic and apathetic, inter-
esting only in how uninteresting 
he is. He’s a Gregor Samsa plagued 
by an alienation so mundane that 
he doesn’t even have the ben-
efit of an obscene transcendence. 
He often speaks in witless cli-
ches, the kind of phrases that any 
M.F.A. teacher would eradicate. 
For example: “We were bored out 
of our skulls,” or “both of us were 
flat-out wasted,” or “It was a real 
scorcher of a night.” These inane 
phrases have the curious effect of 
simultaneously manifesting narra-
tive voice and flattening it.

“Hear the Wind Sing” embraces 

its own banality but, like Lennie 

Small, holds on too tight. When 
Murakami reaches for moments 
of dramatic poignancy, he’s left 
empty handed. It’s difficult enough 
to affect the emotions of a reader 
with authentic, realist characters, 
but when he makes a formal point 
of wiping away individuation from 
his characters, it’s impossible. So, 
when one of the narrator’s girl-
friends suffers through the emo-
tional devastation of an abortion, 
it’s difficult to empathize with her 
because, imaginatively, she barely 
exists. His characters suffer in a 
vacuum. He sucks out their trag-
edies.

“Pinball, 1973” is a better novel 

than its predecessor. “Hear the 
Wind Sing” allowed Murakami to 
merely wet his feet, but he began to 
swim in “Pinball, 1973.” The post-
modern pyrotechnics he experi-
ments with in his debut start to 
function properly in his follow-up; 
they’re not spectacular, but the 
sparks are unmissable.

Once again, “Pinball, 1973” fol-

lows the now-separated narrator 
and The Rat. The narrator devel-
ops an obsession with a three-
flipper pinball machine called 
The Spaceship, also known as “the 
machine of misfortune.” He works 
as a translator and lives with two 
nameless twins who move in with 
him unexpectedly and are only 
identified by the numbered sweat-
shirts they wear.

One can see the scaffold upon 

which Murakami would build his 
illustrious career. Most of the plea-
sure from reading his early nov-
els stems from witnessing a deft 
writer learn his craft. They will 
delight devout Murakami fans, but 
it’s unlikely to give them new com-
panions.

DAILY BOOK REVIEW

‘Moonbeam City’ all 
shine, too shallow

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

Comedy Central’s latest foray 

into animation, “Moonbeam City,” 
feels like something that might 
be great one 
day, even if its 
first episode is 
nothing spec-
tacular.

The 
series 

comes 
from 

“Conan” 
alumn 
Scott 

Gairdner and 
stars 
Rob 

Lowe (“Parks 
and Recreation”) as dashing police 
detective Dazzle Novak, a sex-
addicted, action hero-type who 
prefers drinking champagne with 
a gaggle of strippers over finding 
a suspect. This leaves the impres-
sion that “Moonbeam City” shares 
more than a couple of ideas with 
the FX spy comedy “Archer.”

Yet, while Archer and his fellow 

ISIS agents play the boors in an 
otherwise serious world of espio-
nage, Dazzle seems to be the per-
fect reflection of his surroundings. 
Like the art-deco city the series 
takes place in, Dazzle Novak’s 
character is a glossy surface over 
a thin and meaningless interior. 
But for all its swaggering aims to 
criticize shows like “CSI: Miami” 
and “Miami Vice,” it’s never clear, 

at least in the pilot, if “Moonbeam 
City” seeks to subvert the conven-
tions of such shows, or if it just 
wants to join the party.

Despite its flaws, “Moonbeam 

City” might just be the best-look-
ing animated series on television. 
Its Patrick Nagle-inspired design 
skewers 1980’s Miami into a 
bright, colorful dystopia that rests 
somewhere between Fritz Lang’s 
“Metropolis” and “Grand Theft 
Auto: Vice City.”

It’s just unfortunate that Gaird-

ner and crew haven’t populated 
such an alluring world with more 
interesting characters. Lowe, to 
his credit, does bring life to a pretty 
superficial character. Yet, there’s 
nothing redeemable about Dazzle. 
Sure he wants to be a “good cop” 
but he’s such a crummy one that 
it’s a wonder, even in a world as 
crazy as his, how he ended up with 
the “#1 Cop” coffee mug in the first 
place. The whole love story with 
a Cuban singer feels like a joke in 
a standalone episode of “Archer,” 
not the culmination of a charac-
ter’s introductory story arc.

The supporting cast touts some 

big names, yet no one really steals 
the show in the first episode. 
Elizabeth Banks (“The Hunger 
Games”) 
plays 
straight-laced 

police chief Pizzaz whose sole pur-
pose, it seems, is to break the balls 
of our main characters. Kate Mara 
(“House of Cards”) meanwhile, 

plays Chrysalis Tate, Dazzle’s lev-
el-headed colleague who’s forced 
to follow his absurd directives as 
the audience’s obligatory stand-
in. Will Forte (“The Last Man on 
Earth”) provides the closest thing 
we get to a stand-out as Dazzle’s 
rival, Rad Cunningham. Forte 
continues to make viewers laugh 
in whatever he’s doing, and his 
role as the mice-bathing Rad is no 
exception.

But even with its stellar cast and 

mesmerizing aesthetic, “Moon-
beam City” should be something 
else, something edgier, dirtier 
and more subversive. Its contem-
poraries, who it liberally borrows 
from, remain memorable not only 
for breaking the rules of good taste 
but maintaining a soul, no matter 
how twisted and tiny it might be.

In 
defense 
of 
“Moonbeam 

City,” the series does have a lot of 
potential. According to those who 
have seen the rest of the first sea-
son, many believe “Moonbeam 
City” will follow a similar path 
to “Bojack Horseman,” the Netf-
lix animated comedy that started 
off with weak first episodes, only 
to grow in quality and become, 
with its second season, one of the 
best shows on television. Still, we 
can’t help but think that in a world 
as densely populated with qual-
ity television as ours “Moonbeam 
City” should have started with a 
bang instead of a thud.

Extra reps and yoga paying 
off for ‘M’ offensive linemen

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

With all five starters returning 

from last season, it was expected 
that the Michigan football team’s 
offensive line would improve in 
2015. But after only marginally 
improving last season in a similar 
situation, the question was how 
much improvement would show 
up on the field.

The quintet of sophomore 

Mason Cole, senior Graham 
Glasgow, juniors Ben Braden, 
Kyle Kalis and Erik Magnuson 
wanted 
to 
make 
sure 
they 

answered that question quickly, 
and for the most part they’ve 
done so.

Thanks to extra reps, strong 

camaraderie and even some yoga, 
the offensive line is in the top 10 
in protecting its quarterback.

“They’re playing more physical 

and 
they’re 
finishing,” 
said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“They’re really making an effort 
to finish right now. So, all five 
of those guys. What’s helping 
our running game right now is 
them and the contribution by the 
backs, but also the receivers.”

After finishing at the bottom of 

the Big Ten and the nation with 
63 sacks and 184 tackles for loss 
allowed the past two seasons, the 
Wolverines have shown night-
and-day improvement.

Just five teams have given 

up fewer than Michigan’s eight 
tackles for loss. Meanwhile, the 
Wolverines have allowed just 
one sack against opponents that 
averaged a combined 2.92 sacks 
per game in 2014, a stat that 
stands as tall as the linemen do.

“They’ve gotten a lot better,” 

said 
redshirt 
sophomore 

defensive 
tackle 
Mo 
Hurst. 

“We see it every day, how much 
better they’ve gotten — we’ve 

all talked about it. It’s good for 
us too, because if you’re going 
against a good O-line every week 
it improves your game because 
everything you do is tougher.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock: “It’s 
been really good, it’s as simple as 
that. Our guys are doing a really 
good job of keeping people off me 
… that’s all you 
can ask for.”

Some 
of 

that can be 
attributed 
to 

experience, 
and 
some 

of it can be 
attributed 
to 
offensive 

line 
coach 

Tim 
Drevno 

— 
fresh 
off 

successful stints with the San 
Francisco 49ers and USC — 
coming in to help. But for Braden, 
the key has come outside of 

practice.

“All the work we’ve done 

outside of practice on our own, I 
really think that’s starting to pay 
off now,” Braden said Monday. 
“After practice we’ll get together, 
take a space with the O-line and 
practice technique. Talk about 
any questions we had during 
practice, or talk about a look we 

were confused 
with.”

In 
addition 

to the reflection 
and technique 
work, the line 
has 
become 

tighter-knit 
than in recent 
years. 
Eating, 

studying 
and 

even 
doing 

yoga 
together 

to improve flexibility, the five are 
nearly inseparable.

“The camaraderie between 

them, they’re such a close group,” 

Hurst said. “They’re always 
hanging 
out, 
they’re 
always 

together, 
doing 
everything 

together.

“That’s how our team has been 

lately. Everyone has such a close 
group, and that’s huge.”

Though Braden noted that 

the group has yet to try hot yoga 
together, he’s pleased with the 
results on the field. The line will 
face a tougher test against No. 
22 BYU, but after improved run 
blocking resulted in 479 rushing 
yards and seven touchdowns in 
the last two games, Michigan 
seems to once again have an 
offensive line with teeth to it.

“All of us sticking together 

and making that goal, I think 
that was something we really 
took to heart,” Braden said. “I 
think the aspect of us coming 
together, even since fall camp 
started, I think was huge for us in 
improvement in pass pro and the 
run game.”

FOOTBALL
Lyons adjusting 
to new position

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

When he first joined the 

Michigan football team this 
summer, fifth-year senior safety 
Wayne Lyons was practically 
speaking a different language.

Lyons, who transferred to 

Michigan from Stanford this 
offseason, had no trouble playing 
football. But when it came to 
Michigan’s 
terminology, 
he 

found himself behind the curve.

“I would see (plays) happening 

so fast, and the concept would be 
the same, (but) I would say the 
Stanford terminology just out 
of natural instinct, rather than 
saying the correct term for it,” 
Lyons said.

With about two weeks left 

in camp, the Michigan coaches 
asked Lyons to try switching to 
safety, which he had played in 
high school, but not since then. 
And combined with the new 
vocabulary, the position switch 
has caused Lyons’ transition to 
be a little slower than he might 
have hoped.

Still, with help from his 

teammates, he has been able 
to adjust to the change. The 
Wolverines’ 
secondary 
is 
a 

relatively experienced core, and 
with many players oscillating 
between corner and safety, there 
are plenty of resources available.

“(Senior safety Jarrod Wilson), 

he’s great with that,” Lyons said. 
“He knows what everyone’s doing 
back there. He’s like the general 
who’s like getting everybody lined 
up, and that’s what coach wants 
me to able to do as well. ... When 
the bullets are flying, when it’s 
high-tempo, 
when 
everyone’s 

running 
no-huddle, 
knowing 

what checks to make, what calls to 
make and making sure everyone’s 

on the same page. That’s why 
communication is key.”

So far, Lyons hasn’t seen much 

game action. He was scarcely on 
the field against Utah or Oregon 
State, but he did get more playing 
time against UNLV.

He has two total tackles in 

three games this season, a far cry 
from the 69 tackles he had as a 
junior, or even the 30 he tallied 
last season. But for Lyons, the 
most important category doesn’t 
show up in the box score.

Part of the reason he decided 

to forego trying out for an NFL 
team and come to Michigan 
instead was to become a more 
versatile player. And though it 
hasn’t translated to statistical 
production, or even much playing 
time, Lyons is satisfied with his 
decision.

“It 
has 
given 
me 
this 

opportunity 
to 
get 
this 

experience at safety before I 
actually get to the next level,” 
Lyons said. “If I get to the NFL 
and they want to try me at safety, 
by me having this experience, I 
have more of a background to fall 
back on, more experience (and) a 
better grasp of what’s going on.”

With two standouts — Wilson 

and redshirt freshman Jabrill 
Peppers — in front of him on the 
depth chart, Lyons is fighting just 
to get on the field.

And 
the 
more 
he 
gets 

acclimated to the position and 
the terminology, the closer that 
comes to being a reality.

“I can see myself stepping in,” 

Lyons said. “Jabrill (may) go to 
nickel a few snaps, I’ll come in 
in the dime package. Sometimes 
Jabrill will go to corner, it all 
depends on what personnel we’re 
in. I’m just working hard every 
day to try to get more reps and 
make an impact on this team.”

Michigan finishes 
third of 15 teams

Mueller runner-
up at one over 

par, three strokes 
behind champion

By RILEY NELSON

Daily Sports Writer

On his final tee shot of the day, 

Kyle Mueller reached the green, 
giving 
the 

sophomore 
a chance to 
eagle 
the 

par-four 18th 
hole 
at 
the 

prestigious 
Inverness 
Club 
in 

Toledo, Ohio.

Like 
the 

rest 
of 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
golf 
team, 

though, he came up short and 
settled for a birdie.

Tuesday, 
the 
Wolverines 

took third place at Toledo’s 
Inverness 
Intercollegiate 

behind California and East 
Tennessee State. It was the first 
time Michigan finished in the 
top five at the Inverness Club.

Despite the team’s successes, 

Michigan coach Chris Whitten 
saw room for improvement.

“We wished 

we could have 
been a little 
bit 
closer 

to 
win 
the 

tournament,” 
Whitten said. 
“We just made 
too 
many 

mistakes 
spread 
out 

over the three 
rounds, but I think overall, we’re 
going in the right direction.”

Mueller’s consistent play was 

a major part of the Wolverines’ 
third-place finish.

The 
Athens, 
Ga., 
native 

was the medalist runner-up, 
finishing one over par and 

just 
three 
strokes 
behind 

Michigan 
State’s 
champion 

Mitch 
Rutledge. 
Michigan 

senior Chris O’Neill finished in 
a three-way tie for sixth.

Mueller was a dominant 

force for the Wolverines as a 
freshman last season, and he 
added to his resumé Tuesday 
with the third top-five finish in 
his 14-event career.

“(Kyle) 
keeps 
doing 
his 

thing,” 
Whitten 
said. 
“He 

strikes the ball well, and he 
really plays smart golf. I don’t 
think anyone’s surprised that 
he played well.”

Michigan sent three other 

golfers to Toledo, including 
freshman Nick Carlson. Though 
Carlson didn’t finish in the top 
20, Whitten is excited about the 
growth he’s seeing in his only 
first-year player.

“(Nick’s) 
played 
in 
both 

tournaments, which is a big deal 
for him,” Whitten said. “He’s 
getting acclimated to college 
golf and the type of courses we 
play, so he struggled in the first 
round this week but got a lot 
better in rounds two and three. 
Nick is all you can ask for as a 
coach.”

This was just the second 

event for the team this season, 
so a third-place finish is a 
positive starting point for the 

rest of the fall.

“I would say 

it was a solid 
tournament,” 
Whitten said. 
“It’s 
one 
of 

the best golf 
courses we’ve 
played all year, 
so we learned 
a 
lot 
about 

how 
we’re 

playing and what we need to get 
better at when we’re there.” 

MEN’S GOLF
Lim shines, ‘M’ takes fourth

By BILLY STAMPFL

For the Daily

After enduring a record of 

0-5-1 
last 
year, 
sophomore 

Kathy Lim rid herself of any 
leftover demons Monday by 
winning the individual match-
play bracket with a victory over 
Jessica Reinecke of Wisconsin 
at the East and West Match Play 
Challenge.

“(I’m) glad you got that 

monkey 
off 
your 
back,” 

Michigan women’s golf coach 
Jan Dowling told Kathy Lim 
after her first victory for the 
Wolverines 
on 
Monday 
in 

Madison. 

Lim, 
a 
Canadian 
citizen 

of Korean descent, traveled 
to Seoul, South Korea this 
past 
summer 
to 
hone 
her 

swing 
while 
working 
with 

top coaches. Changes made 
during the offseason presented 
themselves early and often over 
the weekend, as Lim used her 
experience to gain an edge.

“I think traveling to all 10 

events 
(last 
season) 
really 

matured me as a person and as 
a golfer,” Lim said. “So this year 
I’m ready to tackle anything 
that’s ahead of me.”

Though Lim found success 

over 
the 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines slowed down after a 
blazing start in qualifying play. 
Michigan earned the No. 2 seed 
thanks in part to performances 
from sophomore Megan Kim 
(66, six-under par) and junior 
Grace 
Choi 

(67, 
five-

under), 
with 
Kim 

recording 
the 
second-

best 
single-

round 
mark 

in 
Michigan 

history. 
Overall, 
the 

Wolverines 
posted a four-under 284 in 
preliminary 
stroke 
play, 
a 

school record.

“We made a lot of birdies as a 

team on Sunday,” Dowling said. 
 

“The rest of the team (came) 
through too … It was a lot of 
fun.”

Michigan could not carry its 

momentum through to Monday, 
however, falling to Oregon, 
4-1, in the semifinal of match 
play. The 21st-ranked Ducks 
took down the Wolverines in 
five close matches, with Kim 
notching 
Michigan’s 
lone 

victory.

Kim’s 
win 

was significant, 
though, 
as 

she 
defeated 

All-American 
senior Caroline 
Inglis 
in 
a 

back-and-forth 
battle.

“(Kim) hung 

in 
there 
the 

whole 
day,” 

Dowling said. “She should take 
a lot of confidence away from it. 
She’s a fighter and a competitor, 
and I don’t know many people 
that hate to lose more than her.”

Dowling 
also 
noted 
her 

squad’s 
resilience, 
as 
the 

Wolverines fought hard on 

Tuesday in a third-place match 
with Indiana. Michigan went 
back and forth with the Hoosiers 
in nearly identical fashion to its 
battle with Oregon, with three 
of the final matches coming 
down to the wire.

“Unfortunately 
we 
didn’t 

come out on top again (against 
Indiana),” Dowling said. “But 
just to go up against a Big 
Ten team that I have a feeling 
we’re going to see a lot of (was 
beneficial).”

Michigan hopes to rebound 

on Oct. 9 at the Yale Women’s 
Intercollegiate in New Haven, 
Connecticut. 

Dowling voiced pleasure in 

the Wolverines’ grit but also 
noted areas of improvement, 
notably their short game and 
unforced errors.

“We’ve got about a three-

week break coming up, so we 
have time to get to work,” 
Dowling said. “Keep breaking 
school records, (and) we’ll be 
good.”

D

ear Emma,

I need advice. How can I 

stop my parents from killing me 
after they find out I spilled a cup 
of coffee on my laptop?

Sincerely,

Coffee Conundrum

Of all of the many, many 

responses I received to my 
previous column (kidding) 
this question posed to me by 
a friend made me think of 
my own relationship with my 
folks. We weren’t allowed to 
touch the walls in my house 
growing up. They are ortho-
dontists, and our white walls 
were pearly-white. Or rather 
not clean but sterile, like their 
instruments. White couch, 
white walls — again, that we 
were not allowed to touch 
— and everything was spot-
less. It was a catch phrase in 
the house — “Don’t touch the 
walls!” — held firmly in my 
parents’ back pocket and ready 
to be drawn out any moment 
my hand neared a wall. The 
first act of rebellion I can claim 

as my own occured when I was 
near school age. I took hold of 
a black ink pen and, eyes fixed 
on my father, grasped it in my 
right hand, neared the tip to 
the perpetually clean walls 
and pressed down to draw a 
thin, singular black line.

So back to your coffee situ-

ation. I know you didn’t spill 
that coffee on purpose, but 
this is a column about messi-
ness, not about intention. I 
did touch the walls. I fell into 
them, scratched them with the 
backs of wooden chairs, peeled 
paint off of them in removing 
Hannah Montana posters, and 
yes, I intentionally, spitefully 
drew on them. Life in its vio-
lently messy glory happened 
in that house, and my parents 
probably wouldn’t have had 
it any other way; in my time 
since leaving that house, in 
which blankets were placed 
meticulously over couches for 
protection, I have been contin-
ually astounded at the general 
chillness of my parents.

In situations like the one 

you are facing, I remind myself 
of the humanness of my par-
ents. Though a somewhat 
comedic question, amid the 

triviality of it there lie real 
tensions between yourself as 
a grown individual and your 
still-childish position as a 
dependant person, and I think 
it is important not to under-
mine the difficulty of such a 
balance.

This is a long winded way 

of saying this: I recommend 
you research the repair and 
replacement costs associated 
with your coffee mishap and 
present these options to your 
parents sooner rather than 
later. This is the practical solu-
tion; alternatively, you could 
use any savings you have to 
quietly replace the laptop I am 
assuming they paid for or will 
have to pay to replace in this 
situation and never speak of it 
again. Up to you.

Best,
Emma Kerr

here is a specific sound 
that comes from an egg 
frying in a pan. Precisely, 

it’s a pan that’s been in commis-
sion for quite some time, possibly 
an immigrant pan from India 
that was smuggled in a suitcase 
so overflowing with handspun 
silks and cottons and gold and 
tears from my grandmother that 
the non-stick never really stood 
a chance — or maybe my mother 
just bought a crappy pan. I don’t 
know, but it doesn’t matter. How 
many of my breakfasts have been 
made in that pan, how much rev-
enue I’ve supplied Trader Joe’s 
simply by way of my love of eggs, 
how many short minutes span-
ning the years 1993 through 2014 
my mom spent providing more 
than just food for her son and her 
daughter: these are questions I 
won’t know the answers to, but 
will always want.

There is a specific sound that 

my mouth made every time I 
made my way to the door for 
school and yelled back at my 
father: “’Slamlaikm.” It was sup-
posed to be “Assalam-u-Alai-
kum,” but I managed to make a 
habit of abusing the Arabic words 
for “peace be upon you.” My 
father didn’t care, though. He just 

wanted to hear it. He would get 
mad if I forgot. He wanted to hear 
his son acknowledge a mutual 
respect. He wanted his children 
to know that he loves them, that 
he does everything for them, but 
that this was what he asked for in 
return: peace.

There is a specific sound that 

my sister’s incredibly full lanyard 
of keys makes as it rotates around 
the gears and mechanisms that 
unlock our house door. She’s 
home from work. My time at 
home alone is over, but time spent 
with my sister is just as vital, just 
as important. “PMT?” she asks. 
Of course, I say. It’s a short drive, 
not more than the six minutes 
and forty-two seconds I once 
timed. Sometimes we have a lot 
to say, most times we don’t. She 
talks more than I do, more than 
I ever will, but that’s not a prob-
lem. I like hearing her talk. I like 
doing this with her.

There is a specific sound that 

emanates from a spoon clanging 
around the sides of a mug full of 
tea. It’s the sound of nostalgia. 
It’s the sound of maternal love, 
of a bridge between cultures, of 
ten minutes spent so casually and 
so trivially yet so full of life that 
these days, my apartment in Ann 

Arbor at 4:30 p.m. feels as if five 
20-year-old guys are crucially 
lacking one middle-aged Indian 
woman who has worked more 
than she has to and deserves a 
nap but can’t because of a family 
of four that never gave her a break 
from cooking. I can stir that 
spoon all I want, but that sound 
is gone forever, tainted by one too 
many 4:30’s spent alone.

There is a specific sound that 

comes when my father turns off 
his car in the driveway, and the 
headlights that had just shone 
through the curtains fade away, 
the NPR that was on his radio at 
a volume way too high turns off 
mid-Ira Glass sentence. He opens 
the door, looks at me sprawled on 
our red sofa, and utters a clear, 
“Assalamu-Alaikum.” I respond 
just as poorly as I did in the 
morning. He takes off his shoes 
and asks about my day, about how 
my classes were, about how his 
son is doing in his formative years 
in a different country than his 
own, and next he’ll move on to my 
sister, asking the same questions 
and securing the same peace of 
mind.

The sound of daily routine, 

gone.

he return of the “swoosh” to the Michigan Athlet-
ics apparel is emblematic of much more than a shiny 
new contract, but of a revitalized fan base and newly 

energized student athletes. But still, according to students, 
athletes and alumni, regardless of the changing dynamics 
between apparel contracts and the school, the block M will 
always belong to fans of Michigan football.

Following the end of the athletic department’s apparel 

contract with Adidas, Interim Athletic Director Jim Hackett 
announced a new partnership with Nike. The deal, which will 
run through 2027, made history as the largest such contract 
in the history of college football at $169 million over 15 years. 
By comparison, the second largest apparel contract, between 
Notre Dame and Under Armour, totals $90 million over 10 
years.

“The University of Michigan ranks high among the world’s 

great institutions of higher learning and enjoys a rich, tradi-
tion-laden history in college sports,” said Joaquin Hidalgo, 
vice president and general manager at Nike North America, in 
a press release. “We eagerly look forward to bringing out the 
best in each other.”

The deal states the University is to receive $76.8 million in 

cash alone, $12 million as a “signing bonus” and $80.2 mil-
lion in apparel. The deal will cover all 31 varsity sports and 
includes guaranteed internships for qualified students and 
research collaborations for future products.

Additionally, the University will have the first football team 

to wear Michael Jordan’s esteemed apparel, previously only 
available to basketball teams.

This isn’t the first time the University made history with 

a Nike contract — the University first signed an endorsement 
contract with Nike in 1994 for $7 million over seven years. Joe 
Roberson, athletic director at the time of the deal, said it was 
“the largest such deal in the history of collegiate sports.”

Nike gave the University $1 million per year in shoes and 

apparel and $75,000 in cash payments to the athletic program 
in the earlier deal, Sports Business Daily reported at the time. 
The company also provided two scholarships in women’s ath-
letics, funded a yearlong fellowship in sports journalism and 
paid $45,000 into scholarships.

The University stayed with Nike for 13 years until signing a 

contract with Adidas in 2007.

This first Nike deal was among the first between apparel 

brands and universities. Prior to wearing Nike brand apparel, 
athletes wore different brands depending on the sport. With 
this deal, all 25 athletic teams at the time wore the same 
“swoosh” on their jerseys.

Today, however, this kind of apparel contract is standard 

practice for non-profit organizations such as the University, 
Marketing Prof. Puneet Manchanda said. Though the Uni-
versity is taking the cash, Nike can gain immense visibility 
through TV and media surrounding athletics.

“For these kinds of contracts, it is essentially a marketing 

investment,” Munchanda said. “The idea is you sponsor a team 
and the publicity of the event and the interest of the audience 
will expose your brand. In the long run you will build a rela-
tionship with the consumer, the brand and the event you are 
sponsoring.”

However, a deal of this magnitude does not come without 

sizable risks. For the University, the risk resides in Nike’s cor-
porate image. Michael Jensen, associate professor of strategy 
at the Business School, said in the event of a Nike scandal, such 
as employing unfair labor practices, the contract’s popularity 
among the University’s fan base could diminish, ultimately 
diminishing it’s value.

“The big risk for the University of Michigan is if it suddenly 

revealed that Nike is a company with a lot of problematic busi-
ness practices,” he said.

Ethical corporate behavior came into question with the 

University’s previous athletic contract with Adidas. In 2012, 
students held a protest urging the University cut ties with Adi-
das, alleging the company did not compensate workers in their 
Indonesian factory. Specifically, students claimed Adidas vio-
lated their contract with the University, which required work-
ers be compensated for the apparel.

Students were not the only ones to express concern for Adi-

das’ company practices. University President Emerita Mary 
Sue Coleman wrote two company executives in September 
2012 requesting they provide assistance and reparations to 
the terminated factory employees in a letter.

“I hope that Adidas will fully appreciate the importance 

the University places on ensuring that the workers who have 
been involved in manufacturing license products receive the 
assistance they require and have earned,” Coleman wrote in 
the letter.

In April 2013, Adidas stated it would pay severance to 

the fired workers. The severance was given in addition to

Personal Statement: Where the Wild Things Are

o say the curve of a tress is a matter of 
debate would be fair. What are we, any-
way, but confused, furry creatures, forced 

to wander the world with a little extra fur on 
top? Some of our fur is curly; some of our fur is 
straight. And in between those crass categories 
there’s a little bit of every texture, color, shape 
and personality. That’s where things get tangled.

I’m speaking, of course, of hair — as this is a 

personal statement, I guess I should say my hair. 
As soon as I burst through the womb (sorry, 
Mom) on that cold January afternoon in 1996, all 
of the nurses gasped, so the legend goes.

“What is it? What’s wrong?”
“She’s just — she’s got so much hair.”
True, I was born with a completely full head 

of silky, dark brown locks. They prompted even 
more shock from onlookers as my mom was 
wheeled out of the hospital (i.e., “Did you have, 
like, major heartburn with all that hair inside 
you?”). My grandma stuck a bow on top of me for 
good measure, but that effort soon fizzled as “the 
Afro” began to set in. Yes, kids, as soon as I start-
ed walking, what was nice baby hair grew into a 
frizzy, kinky, incomprehensibly thick, certifiably 
untamable mop.

Haircuts, as a little girl, were hell realized. 

Crying, thrashing, combing — only these vio-
lent verbs capture the traumatic shards of salon 
memories I’m left with. (Sometimes I like to set 
them to music from “The Omen,” but only on par-
ticularly low days.) I began to regard my stylist, 
Carla, as Satan’s mistress, and with that in mind 
she bought me cookies to incentivize and desen-
sitize visits as much as possible. Washing my hair 
at home was just as much of a process: my mother, 
a “lucky” one bestowed with slightly wavy, most-

ly straight fur, didn’t really know what to do with 
mine. I can recall sitting on my bedroom floor, 
Mom piling Johnson’s No More Tangles Spray 
(probably meant for weaker curls than mine) onto 
my mane to absolutely no avail. Combs. Tears. 
Heartbreak. Rinse and repeat.

One of my favorite movies growing up was The 

Princess Diaries. Just writing that I’m immedi-
ately struck with visions of pre-makeover Mia 
Thermopolis — a classic cinematic “nerd,” she 
has one defining physical characteristic: dark, 
thick, curly, frizzy hair. After the debonair Julie 
Andrews swoops in with the eponymous royal 
surprise of the film, she decides something must 
be done to ameliorate Mia’s appearance. (Queen 
Clarice’s granddaughter better look like the 
Prin-cess of Genovia, damnit.) So the Cinderella 
rigmarole happens and the big whooshing-away-
of-the-metaphorical-curtain reveals what, ulti-
mately? A conventionally more “beautiful” Mia, 
with mascara and waxed eyebrows — and nothing 
other than bone-straight hair.

I blame that scene. Well, that scene and my 

broken hair ties. When middle school hit, I got my 
first straightener, and I soon became enthralled 
with the idea of tameness, of fur docility. Straight 
hair was cool; princesses had straight hair 
because curly hair was ugly. Celebrities — most 
of them — boasted sleek, kink-free locks (think: 
Britney, bitch). Why shouldn’t I have the same? 
With each crushing of a hair chunk through those 
magmatic irons and their toxic power, I felt pret-
tier. Killing hair to get happy, sweating my life 
away during the 30-minute process — hogwash. 
Beauty is pain, darling. By the time my whole 
head was done, relief would flood me. Now I 
won’t stand out. Now I’ll be able to walk into a 

room and not worry about people staring at my 
Bozo wig. I feel sharp; I feel beautiful. I can walk 
through a crowd on the street and feel normal.

So now it’s time for what I call the Nike swish 

— the grand twist in the plot where I fall in love 
with my natural hair un-conditioner-ally, admit 
that I’m four years sober from the straightener, 
and tell you about that one time when Colin Firth 
ran to my London flat to tell me he loves me, just 
as I am.

That hasn’t happened. The aforementioned, 

deep-rooted doubts still plague me, and right now 
my flat iron is sitting on a shelf in my dorm, ready 
for action. Colin Firth is nowhere in sight. If any-
thing, my willpower has changed — and my van-
tage point. If we look at hair from a more “meta” 
standpoint, as an extension of the creature it 
inhabits and subsequently the creature itself, why 
would we change it if there was nothing wrong? 
Why would we slaughter our fur, our essence, the 
thing that separates us from the other creatures 
around town? I’ve been told to “thin it” — flatten 
it out, control it, cut it all off. But I can’t. After all, 
it is me and I am it: curly, confusing, symphonic, 
a little rebellious, a lot unconventional, kind of 
intellectual if you stare at it for a while and — 
supremely, my most favorite — inimitable.

No matter how hard I try, I can’t get a Brazil-

ian blowout to squash the intrinsic quirks of me, 
the extra furry one who hobbles — nay, saunters 
through Ann Arbor — with her full personality 
and her full hair. My mop is neither beautiful 
nor ugly, and I’ve come to realize that’s true of 
everyone. It simply is itself: and that’s enough of 
an argument to respect it, preserve and convey 
its natural state, and let it romp around like the 
uninhabited creature it was meant to be.

$525,000 the company already had given them for aid and 
organized job placement programs and food vouchers.

“We are committed to long-term solutions and wanted to 

resolve this matter so we could ensure the focus moves to 
sustainable solutions for the future,” Katja Schreiber, Adidas 
Group spokesperson at the time, wrote in an e-mail to The 
Michigan Daily. “This additional assistance will provide addi-
tional relief to workers and their families still impacted from 
the unethical factory closure.”

However, the company was in some ways too late — at the 

time of this decision, 17 colleges terminated their contracts 
with Adidas in the wake of country-wide student protests. 
Though he made no reference to this, Hackett’s decision 
against Adidas could have been impacted by the lasting 
impact of the company’s actions.

Nike’s reputation is not the only one on the line with this 

contract. For the value of the contract to be upheld, the Uni-
versity needs to show success on the field.

“(The football team is) the biggest risk for Nike,” Jensen 

said. “If the University football team continues to do poorly 
and therefore not give the expected value of TV appearances.”

Despite the contract’s immense monetary value, the deci-

sion to sign with Nike was not about the money, Hackett said 
in a July interview with the Michigan Daily. Because Nike, 
Adidas and Under Armour were all vying for the athletic 
department’s apparel, Hackett’s decision went beyond financ-
es.

“I was looking for the future,” Hackett said. “It didn’t mat-

ter that Nike was really successful here in the past, it didn’t 
matter that Under Armour had invented a wicking system no 
one else had, it didn’t matter that Adidas had this global domi-
nance, we’re signing a new 15-year deal.”

According to Hackett, the decision included looking at not 

only market research and performance evaluations, but also 
feedback from fans, players and alumni on each of the three 
companies.

Athletes embrace social responsibility

by Zach Shaw, Daily Sports Writer

I

t doesn’t take long for Jordan Morgan to remember 
why he’s spending a gorgeous summer afternoon 
cleaning up an eyesore of a street in Detroit. Once 

homeless in Detroit, Morgan fought through poverty, 
malnourishment and hundreds of other challenges to star 
for the Michigan basketball team, earn two engineering 
degrees, and eventually go pro in 
Europe.

It doesn’t take long for Mike 

Martin to remember why he’s bus-
sing kids in from Detroit to his 
free youth camp, either. Growing 
up in a single-mother household 
without a ride to practice, Mar-
tin had to find the drive within 
to not only finish his degree but 
lead Michigan football to the 2011 
Sugar Bowl Championship.

It doesn’t take long to remem-

ber, because they didn’t get there 
alone.

Though both — among thou-

sands 
of 
athletes 
worldwide 

— have incredible journeys to suc-
cess, they are largely the product 
of volunteers, tireless coaches and 
family members and community 
events that kept their doors open 
and their spirits high.

“I can tell you that nobody gets 

where they are without the help 
of others,” Morgan said. “There 
are so many people that are so 
invested in me and my welfare, but 
there’s a high level of obligation 
for myself.”

This obligation sticks with 

Morgan, Martin and others that 
grew up disadvantaged. But at 
Michigan, even those that had an 
easier path feel the responsibility 
to use their capital, resources and 
abilities to give back to the com-
munity — that’s the easier part.

The hard part is making that 

desire to give back count. But with 
a new department solely focused 
on it, alumni leading the way, put-
ting away the scorebook and open-
ing the field to new resources, 
Michigan is close to fulfilling its 
athlete social responsibility.

***

When the term corporate social responsibility first 

was coined in the 1950s, few imagined the concept would 
make its way inside Michigan Stadium. Defined by Busi-
ness Dictionary as “a company’s sense of responsibility 
towards the community and environment (both ecological 
and social) in which it operates,” it was designed to remind 
businesses that their job extended beyond financial share-
holders to community stakeholders. Without the support 
of consumers, the community, family members, friends 
and all employees, a business would fail regardless of its 
financial know-how.

While “athlete social responsibility” hasn’t gained the 

same official recognition, the parallels are evident. Win-
ning is important, but without the continued support of 
boosters, fans, local residents, media members and every-
one involved with the team, even the most successful team 
on the field will fail.

To gain that support, student athletes embrace the pres-

sure to make the first move.

“You definitely want to make it come full circle,” Martin 

said. “It’s hard to have success and not think about every-
one in the community that helped you, and deserves that 
success too.”

Morgan and Martin are far from the first athletes to 

give back. Babe Ruth — arguably the first sports celebrity 
— was famous for visiting hospitals before games, then hit-
ting home runs for the children he visited. Nearly every 
professional team has at least one foundation they contrib-

ute to, and most athletes do individual work as well.

Michigan’s first community service partnership began 

with football players visiting C.S. Mott’s Children’s Hos-
pital 25 years ago — a practice that has expanded to all 
student-athletes and still occurs every Thursday.

Today, Michigan has 11 major community service part-

ners, and its approximate 900 
student-athletes conduct 20,000 
hours of service per year, accord-
ing to the athletic department.

“It’s something you’re proud 

of,” said defensive line coach Greg 
Mattison, who has coached for 41 
seasons including eight at Michi-
gan. “When we say ‘Michigan 
Man,’ a lot of that has to do with 
how you handle success and give 
back.”

Achieving 20,000 hours as a 

group and raising tens of thou-
sands for charity, community 
service participation is at an all-
time high with Michigan student-
athletes. Still, some are skeptical 
about the motivations.

With the rise of foundations 

and community service came an 
equal rise in criticism of “savior 
mentality” among those partici-
pating in projects.

Jevon Moore, coordinator at 

the Office of Community and 
University Engagement, doesn’t 
blame people for thinking that 
way. Moore oversees all of Michi-
gan’s community service endeav-
ors. He’s happy with the strength 
and popularity of the Mott’s vis-
its, but isn’t naïve of the celebrity 
mentality.

“For a long time, that’s what it 

was — just celebrity appearanc-
es,” Moore said. “Then people got 
turned off by that because it seems 
like it could just be for attention or 
for image.”

The seldom heard of office 

opened in 2013 after community 
service interest reached record 
levels.

And while Moore loved so many 

different organizations reaching 
out to the teams, coaches and Ath-

letic Administrators, it became clear someone needed to 
arrange these in a unified way.

“We wanted to have one place where we could send 

potential partners and events and really put a plan in place 
to make something work,” Moore said. “We don’t want our 
athletes to just show up and be a celebrity face, we want 
them to be helpful in more ways, and for the experience to 
benefit them as well. We want it to be a two-way street.”

Moore had no problem finding partners that wanted 

to work with Michigan student-athletes. Food Gatherers,

LSA senior Dominic Jamett, president 

of the Student Athlete Advisory Council, 
said the administration reached out to 
him and other student-athletes for feed-
back on the apparel companies.

He said he appreciates the way the 

athletic department is receptive to input 
from student-athletes.

“We are pretty lucky that we have an 

athletic department that cares so much 
about our opportunities,” Jamett said. 
“The gear that we get provided is second 
to none and students recognize that, and 
we definitely do not take that for grant-
ed.”

Student athletes are not the only ones 

pleased with the athletic department’s 
decision. Though the athletic department 
did not reach out to the Alumni Associa-
tion in a similar way, Dave Schueler, vice 
president of alumni engagement at the 
Alumni Association, said he noticed posi-
tive reaction among alums across their 
social media platforms.

“Sometimes just something new is 

exciting in general, I think people rallied 
around having something new or differ-
ent to talk about,” he said.

Schueler speculates the deal brought 

back memories from when the Univer-
sity previously signed with Nike, as the 
company worked with beloved Michigan 
football coach Lloyd Carr. Because the 
University signed with Nike for a lon-
ger period of time than with Adidas, he 
says more alumni felt connected to the 
“swoosh.”

With the recent hiring of Jim Har-

baugh and contract deal with Nike, alum-
ni can’t help but feel hopeful for the next 
chapter in University athletic history, 
Schueler said.

“All of the things that are new are 

exciting and, perhaps, some of the new 
things remind us of the success that the 
athletic program, specifically football, 
had in years past,” he said.

For Jamett, however, the gear does not 

make or break wins. He said not only are 
student-athletes unphased by the size of 
the deal, fans will not be impacted by the 
Nike deal because they came out for the 
student-athletes — not the jerseys.

“I do not think the brand of gear is the 

biggest thing right now,” he said. “At the 
end of the day, it is going to have the block 
M and I think that is what people love.”

System and plenty more expressed inter-
est.

He also learned quickly that with a 

group of competitive and well-rounded 
individuals, he had no problem getting stu-
dent athletes interested in helping, either.

In fact, slowing them down proved to be 

the toughest challenge.

The 
University 

Athletic 
Department 

established the Rachael 
Townsend Community 
Service Award in 2009. 
Hoping to push student 
athletes to carry that 
one more rep mentality 
into helping others, the 
idea was to reward the 
teams that performed 
the most community 
service throughout the 
year.

It worked, but with a 

cost. Hours and interest 
in service soared, but 
when Moore switched 
the award from a quan-
tity-based team honor 
to 
a 
quality-focused 

individual one in 2013, 
Michigan was admit-
ting it had lost what it 
was after.

“We 
found 
that 

everyone was so caught 
up in hours and putting 
up big numbers, the ser-
vice wasn’t that effec-
tive,” Moore said. “We’d 
rather see fewer hours 
and participation than 
people just in it for the 
hours if it increases the 
value and impact.”

Michigan 
is 
the 

only school to Moore’s 
knowledge that no lon-
ger has an hours-based 
reward or quota, and 
taking the competition 
out of community service 
did come with a drop in 
participation. 
But 
the 

support was there.

“You can’t make these things manda-

tory, you have to really value it,” said Kine-
siology junior Sophie DuPhily, a member 
of the lacrosse team who is also serving as 
the SAAC Community Engagement Chair. 
“It’s important to get people to find value 
in it themselves, not just add it to practice, 
school and everything else.”

Moore makes resources and events 

known and helps when needed, but has 
eliminated enforcements, counting on 
teams and student-athletes to motivate 
each other.

For DuPhily, whose team was all fresh-

men when the new system took over in 
2013, the toughest hurdle is the first one.

“I was a little slow to start on communi-

ty service,” DuPhily said. “We didn’t really 

have anyone to show us the way, but once I 
got started, I was hooked.”

“We don’t make it mandatory, but I will 

try to get people who haven’t gone before 
to go with me. The first time is usually the 
hardest, after that they can’t wait to go 
back.”

In addition to the shift away from man-

datory service, Michigan has tried to 

modernize the way its student-athletes go 
about service.

Reaching out to the Ginsburg Center, 

SAPAC and other campus-based resources, 
Moore has set out to increase the educa-
tional component of service. Though it’s 
admittedly tough to manage full training 
and reflection sessions when balancing the 
priorities of student-athletes, Moore says it 
never hurts to get creative.

“We might not get hours with (the stu-

dent-athletes),” he said. “But on the way to 
and from campus we can discuss why they 
get involved in the community and what 
they get from the opportunity through 
identification, through reflection, through 
exploration of themselves.”

While the service may be helpful today, 

the true impact will be seen down the road.

Once Martin’s bus pulls into the Pioneer 

High School parking lot to begin his youth 
camp, he’s at home. The Big House may 
be across the street, but as he’s greeted by 
over a dozen other NFL players volunteer-
ing their time, a wide grin covers his face.

That grin grows to make his 6-foot-2, 

306-pound frame look small as the kids 

get off the bus and 
sprint to the field. 
Many hail from the 
area of Detroit where 
he grew up. Martin 
knows the impact his 
camp can have on the 
kids, because he once 
was those kids.

“We can relate to 

a lot of the things 
they’re saying because 
we know the area and 
a bit of what they 
go 
through,” 
said 

Philadelphia 
Eagles 

linebacker 
Brandon 

Graham, 
a 
former 

Michigan 
football 

player. 
“You 
might 

have gone to the same 
schools or know some 
of the same people. 
The conversation and 
connection is there 
because you’re from 
the same place.”

The same can be 

said for current Mich-
igan athletes. When 
DuPhily and 30 other 
Michigan 
student-

athletes 
volunteered 

at 
Camp 
Catch-A-

Rainbow — a YMCA 
youth camp for cur-
rent or former can-
cer patients — during 
spring 
term, 
many 

were 
reminded 
of 

times getting to know 
athletes in the past, 

and reminded why they 
go to Michigan.

“That’s our biggest 

goal, to find something for everyone,” 
Moore said. “Not everyone wants to work 
with kids, so it’s about finding what kind of 
work you do want to do — what you’ll get 
passionate about. Because when you have 
that passion, it shows.”

Despite taking away the scorebook, rules 

and trophies, Michigan student-athletes 
continue to give back. Despite everything 
else they have to worry about, the student-
athletes feel socially responsible.

“I think there’s an obligation to give 

back,” DuPhily said. “You’re not getting 
a reward for doing it, but you’re a part of 
the Michigan family, and that does create a 
moral right to give back to the community 
and to strengthen that connection in any 
way you can.”

The gear that we 
get provided is 
second to none

hough I only lived at the University of Michigan’s Biological Station for a brief 

period of time, I feel an internal shift in character; calmer, an increase of solidity, 

a more thorough understanding in who I am and where I fit in the great, complex 

scheme of life. 

“I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees,” Henry David Thoreau 

wrote after living two years immersed in undisturbed natural surroundings. I felt this 

way too, after living in a metal shack-like cabin in the far northern part of Michigan’s 

Lower Peninsula for only two months.

At this place also deemed “Bug Camp” by its residents, students join faculty and 

researchers from all over the U.S. (and beyond) who hold expertise in a wide array of 

scientific knowledge and experience. What makes the Biological Station so unique is not 

only this aspect, but also that everyone — professors, students, faculty, other researchers — 

live in camp together and are easily accessible to help in scientific or life endeavors, and are 

also around to just hang out. Meals are taken together by the whole camp in the dining hall 

and are great opportunities to meet other people. At one such meal I found myself sitting 

with Chuck Davis, professor and curator of plants at Harvard University and one of the 

well-loved botany professors at the Biological Station. Our conversation led into some of 

his research involving plant parasites and the different types of strategies plant species use. 

Though I do not want to become a plant parasite specialist, the way Chuck discussed his 

research made me want to know more. His enthusiasm and obvious love of the discipline 

kept me asking questions about this subject I really had known nothing about.

I was enrolled in the Forest Ecosystems and General Ecology classes at the Biological 

Station. Each class structure generally started out with an hour lecture in the morning 

followed by a day in the field relating to the previous lecture. We traveled to the Upper 

Peninsula of Michigan multiple times as well as closer areas, all varying in ecosystem type 

and intended lesson. We would usually collect data to analyze later and write about or 

present later the findings as homework. This method of teaching was extremely effective 

for me. Now, when I walk through a forest or a bog or on a dune, I see in a larger and more 

complex way.

During downtime many of us would find something to stay occupied. We would kayak 

or canoe, swim in Lake Douglas, go ride the “slime slide,” play basketball, read, lounge in 

a hammock, bike or walk the trails through the woods. Though it seemed like there’s not 

much to do at first glance at this rustic camp, the possibilities are actually endless.

Both of my group research projects collaborated outside of class with research scientists 

at the Biological Station and we did a lot of work, but found significant and interesting 

results in both of our projects. We understand much more thoroughly the subjects of 

our research, and even better, our research will contribute to the projects others are 

and have been working on for years, which will be part of published studies in academic 

journals. To be credited in an academic journal as an undergraduate student is a no small 

accomplishment.

Overall, being in this pristine place has made a lasting effect on me that will not fade 

with time. It’s a slow change from the first day. It’s a change you don’t notice until you leave 

and come back to your former life. On the door of my friend’s cabin behind the hammocks 

it reads “Welcome to the Trap.” The University of Michigan Biological Station is a trap, a 

magnificent trap, one that I look forward into falling in all over again.
