In an effort to increase 

awareness 
of 
sexual 
assault 

on campus, members of the 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 

and Awareness Center’s Peer 
Education 
program 
had 
a 

number of stations out on the 
Diag 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 

showcasing 
different 
aspects 

of healthy relationships and 
consent.

Nursing senior Lena Briggs, 

peer education co-coordinator 
at 
SAPAC, 
helped 
organize 

the event — consisting of the 
education station, the policy and 
activism table, the swag station 
and the self-care table — and said 
she hoped it brought visibility to 
key issues SAPAC focuses on.

“We want to spread messages 

of positivity around healthy 
relationships and around consent 
so that people can engage in these 
behaviors with their partners 
and their peers,” Briggs said. 
“We also want to create a more 
positive culture around campus 
and 
hopefully 
prevent 
any 

violence as well.”

To achieve this goal, the 

education station focused on 
providing students with facts 
and statistics on sexual assault 
through an educational game. 
LSA senior Andreea Taran, a 
SAPAC volunteer, helped run the 
station.

“We 
are 
going 
through 

some statements on healthy 
relationships, 
consent 
and 

sexual assault that are kind of 
controversial, like false reporting 
statistics,” Taran said.

The policy and activism station 

featured pamphlets discussing 
sexual 
assault 
prevention 

policies and ways to contact local 
representatives, the swag station 
handed out SAPAC resources 
and the self-care station aided 
students facing exam stress.

“Healthy 
relationships 
are 

centered around equality, respect 

and love,” Briggs said. “People 
should feel empowered enough 
to say ‘no’ when they want to, 
they should ask for consent in 
any sexual activity and know that 
consent is easy.”

The event partnered with 

Raise the Bar, a program that 
trains personnel at local bars 
around campus in bystander 
intervention in sexual assault. 
Students were encouraged to 
visit all four stations to be entered 

into a raffle for prizes sponsored 
by the bars participating in the 
program.

“Consent is all about showing 

respect for your partner and for 
yourself, and we are all about 
establishing that as a precursor 
to help fight sexual assault on 
campus,” Taran said.

University 
of 
Michigan 

LSA 
Student 
Government 

discussed and voted on two 
resolutions Wednesday night 
to allocate funding for a light 
therapy room in the Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library and to 
suggest LSA change its current 
exam policy from allowing 
students to take a maximum of 
three exams in one day to two 
exams in a day. 

Both 
the 
light 
therapy 

resolution 
and 
the 
exam 

policy 
resolution 
passed 

unanimously, with 21 votes in 
favor and no votes against or 
abstentions.

The meeting also featured 

resolutions on free speech in 
LSA SG and the conditions of 
the Mason Hall bathrooms — 
both of which passed — and 
calling for adequate lighting 
on North Campus, which was 
tabled until the first summer 
session.

Public Policy junior Nadine 

Jawad, vice president of Central 
Student 
Government, 
was 

named a Truman Scholarship, 
an award that celebrates a 
commitment to public service. 
She will be the 27th candidate 
at the University of Michigan to 
receive this prestigious award. 

According 
to 
a 
press 

release, Jawad was one of 62 
undergraduates to be awarded 
a scholarship this year, out of 
the 768 students who were 
nominated. Candidates must be 
nominated by their university 
in their junior year, and then 
recipients are chosen by a 
selection panel based on a series 
of personal essays, letters and 
interviews.

Jawad 
aims 
to 
use 
the 

scholarship to pursue a degree in 
medicine and a Master of Public 
Health, with an interest in 
women’s health and a potential 
focus 
on 
HPV, 
gynecologic 

cancers and diseases that arise 

in situations of intimate partner 
violence.

“Ultimately, I’d like to work 

somewhere in the government 
sector, the (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention) or the 
World Health Organization — 
that way I can blend my interest 
in public policy with my interest 
in medicine and kind of do both,” 
she said.

Marjorie 
Horton, 
the 

assistant dean for undergraduate 
education, wrote in an email 
interview 
she 
met 
Jawad 

through Jawad’s participation in 
CSG and was unsurprised by her 
success with the award.

“I see that intensity, drive 

and tireless work ethic in all 
that Nadine takes on,” Horton 
wrote. “She focuses on how 
to have a very real, tangible 
impact. With her leadership 
and 
organizational 
savvy 

and 
personal 
magnetism, 

she 
harnesses 
the 
talents 

and passions of many other

Debbie Dingell, faculty members 
send seniors off in ‘Last Lecture’

JOHN YAEGER/Daily

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich) speaks at the third annual Last Lecture Series in Weill Hall on Wednesday.

ACADEMICS

New CSG vice president is one of 62 
Truman recipients for public service

EMILY MIILLER
Daily Staff Reporter

Annual event aimed to encourage graduating students to take hold of opportunity, challenges

Wrapping 
up 
the 
year 
for 

Public Policy seniors was U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) and 
distinguished professors of the 
University of Michigan to deliver 
what is traditionally called the Last 
Lecture.

The event, as part of the third 

annual Public Policy Last Lecture 
series, brought University seniors 
to Weill Hall on Wednesday to leave 
them with lasting words as they face 

graduation at the end of the month. 

Public Policy senior Keerthana 

Sundar helped organize the event, 
and noted its importance in sending 
off the seniors.

“The Last Lecture is a capstone 

event that ties together a variety 
of policy topics and perspectives 
to end the school year,” Sundar 
said. “It’s a send-off lecture full of 
insightful advice and anecdotes 
from our favorite professors.”

This year’s talk, called “Bursting 

the Bubble: Policy in the Age of 
Polarization,” aimed to discuss 
politics after the 2016 presidential 

election, as well as the importance 
of breaking down party barriers. 
Public Policy senior Connor Rubin, 
another co-organizer of the event, 
believed this year’s theme was 
particularly important given the 
events of the past year.

“This election was one of the most 

polarizing in recent history, and I 
think anyone interested in making 
a difference in their community 
needs to realize that yelling is easy, 
but doesn’t solve anything,” said 
Rubin. “The goal of this (lecture) is 
to show a variety of perspectives, 
because no singular point of view 

has a monopoly on good ideas.”

Students listened to Dingell and 

Public Policy professors give advice 
on their upcoming endeavors, as 
well as interpretations of today’s 
political climate.

“You are graduating in very 

unique and challenging times,” 
Dingell said. “You are in a rapidly 
changing 
political, 
social 
and 

economic landscape, and will need 
to use what you have learned here 
at the University of Michigan to 
address the opportunities and the 
challenges that lay ahead.”

When the elevator in 

your apartment is stuck, you 

blame it on the landlord. 

Most would never expect Ben 

Carson, the United States 

Secretary of Housing and Urban 

Development, however, to be in 

this situation himself. 

According to the Miami 

Herald, Carson, a University 

of Michigan Medical School 

alum and former Republican 

presidential candidate, was 

trapped in a Miami apartment 

complex elevator Wednesday 

morning. 

With Miami Heat basketball 

icon Alonzo Mourning awaiting 

his descent in the lobby, Carson 

and six other people were stuck 

until local authorities pried the 

doors open.

Carson was on the third 

stop of his national listening 

tour for HUD and was being 

led through the $22.8 million 

Courtside Family Apartments. 

In his group was Michael Liu, 

the Miami-Dade County Public 

Housing Director.

After observing the roof of 

the complex, Carson got into the 

infamous elevator and remained 

in it for 20 minutes.

According to the Herald, 

Carson took the accident in 

good stride and continued on 

his tour of Miami.

Each speaker interpreted the 

themes of political bubbles and 
polarization 
differently, 
and 

encouraged graduating students 
to do the same. Ann Lin, an 
associate professor of Public 
Policy, relayed the importance 
of understanding these different 
perspectives.

“There will be moments where 

you see an issue, a person, a 
problem that is not fundamentally 
you,” Lin said. “And yet, there is 
some way with which you can 
identify with it.”

Other 
speakers 
included 

Public 
Policy 
Dean 
Susan 

Collins, Assistant Prof. Megan 
Tompkins-Stange, 
Associate 

Prof. 
Shobita 
Parthasarathy 

and U.S. Ambassador Melvyn 
Levitsky. Speakers touched on 
subjects including life advice for 
seniors and memories of the late 
President Gerald Ford, clearly 
distinguishing each speaker from 
the next. Public Policy junior Aditi 
Katti said she was surprised by 
the range of topics.

“I didn’t know that they would 

be speaking about the same topic 
from very different perspectives,” 
Katti said. “It was very cool 
that we got a diverse range of 
perspectives and ideas.”

As the faculty featured at the 

capstone event were chosen by the 
students themselves, Lin said the 
event was especially meaningful 
and twofold. 

“It’s really an honor after 

(students) listen to you for a whole 
semester, they still want to hear 
something that you have to say,” 
Lin said.

Sundar noted the significance 

of having these faculty members 
present. 

“We picked the speakers based 

on the feedback of our classmates 
— we approached the educators 
they thought had left the biggest 
impact on them and they wanted 
to hear more from,” Sundar said. 
“I also hope that (the lecture) will 
add on to the education (students) 
have received at the Ford School 
and equip them with the soft 
skills to engage in meaningful 
introspection 
and 
productive 

debate, and be better problem 
solvers and policy-makers.”

what she sets out to do and 
usually much more.”

Jawad cited her various 

involvements at the University 
as instrumental to applying to 
and receiving this scholarship, 
such 
as 
her 
three-year 

involvement in CSG, Books 
for a Benefit — a student 
organization she co-founded 
to promote children’s literacy 
in the metro Detroit area — 
and work in a research lab 
focused on HPV and oncology.

“What really helped me is 

the wide range of activities 
I’m involved in,” Jawad said. 
“I wouldn’t attribute it to one 
specific activity, I’d rather say 
that the overlapping activities 
really defined my experience 
and helped me with the 
application process.”

Henry Dyson, director of the 

Office of National Scholarships 
and Fellowships, said Jawad 
is the second student in two 
years at the University to win 
a Truman Scholarship. In an 
email interview, he wrote he 
hopes the University continues 
the trend of performing well 
with the Truman Scholarship 
by supporting candidates like 
Jawad.

“Of 
all 
the 
prestigious 

scholarships 
that 
I 
work 

with, 
I 
feel 
a 
particular 

connection to the Truman 
because 
it 
celebrates 
the 

same educational ideals that 
make Michigan such a great 
public university: academic 
excellence, 
demonstrated 

leadership, 
and 
a 
strong 

commitment 
to 
serve 
the 

common good,” he wrote. 
“Nadine truly represents each 
of these ideals. Every time I 
meet with her, I’m inspired to 
renew my own commitment 
to serving others — it just 
radiates from her.”

Anthropology Prof. Holly 

Peters-Golden wrote in an 
email 
interview 
Jawad’s 

motivation was a large factor 
in her receiving this award.

“Shaka: Our Africa” is a 

fitting title for the annual 
culture show that showcases 
Africa. For the past 19 years, the 
African Students Association 
has put on the culture show 
to celebrate the roots of its 
members. This year, I had the 
privilege of being a part of the 
show, so I’m giving you all an 
exclusive look into what the 
show means to the community 
that puts it on and to me, a 
senior editor for The Michigan 
Daily’s Michigan in Color. To 
me, ASA is my home away from 
home. My outlet to remember, 
appreciate and celebrate my 
Nigerian roots.

Special 
thanks 
to 
our 

wonderful photographer Adam 
Brodnax, fellow MiC senior 
editor and Business junior, for 
capturing the show in all its 
glory.

“For the first time, I made it 

out to the ASA Culture Show,” 
Brodnax said. “It was an 
incredible experience that gave 
me a glimpse into the beauty 
and complexity of Africa and 
the many countries’ unique 
cultures. I was humbled to be 
able to capture the event and 
seeing so many of friends was 
so exciting!”

A lot of people may think 

Africa is filled with third-
world 
countries, 
poverty, 

violence and hunger but ASA 
wants you all to know there’s 
so much more to Africa. Shaka 
presents to its audience the 
beauty of our Africa.

“The culture show was such 

a great experience that allowed 
me to better understand African 

culture while appreciating it at 
the same time,” said Che ’Rai 
Laster, LSA freshman.

“I loved Shaka. It took me out 

of my comfort zone. It made me 
embrace my culture more than I 
already do,” said Bianca Oteng, 
LSA sophomore.

“ASA 
is 
important 
to 

me because it allows me to 
showcase my culture in a fun 
and creative way,” said Zinny 
Weli, Engineering senior.

“The ASA culture show has 

been an opportunity for me to 
learn more about the diversity 
and beauty that is found within 
Africa. The show celebrates 
difference as a strength and 
avenue to explore similarities 
that we also share across the 
various ethnic backgrounds of 
participants in the show. I have 
been in the show these past two 
years, and as I go into my senior 
year, I look forward to being 
able 
to 
experience 
another 

culture 
show,” 
said 
Sharae 

Franklin, Education junior.

“I have great admiration 

and love for African culture, 
and because Africa is a huge 
continent, vast and diverse, I 
always need to learn more. The 
more countries I visit, the more 
humble and in awe I am of how 
much I did not know. I feel in 
my blood we are all related and 

all humanity originated from 
Africa!” said Oana GiraAmata, 
a dance instructor.

“I wish I would have taken 

the initiative to be a part of ASA 
my freshman year so I could’ve 
had four years of being a part of 
such a wonderful community. To 
me, ASA is a space where I can 
truly be myself, learn about my 
heritage, and meet others that 
also share my love for jollof rice 
and fried plantains. Nigerian 
jollof rice, that is,” said Paul E. 
F. Akande, Engineering senior.

“ASA to me means knowledge 

and 
revelation. 
Knowledge 

about the beautiful culture 
that comes from Africa. Being 
in ASA has helped to rewire 
my psyche and dismantle some 
of 
the 
internal 
stereotypes 

that were placed upon me, and 
many others, by society. Being a 
member exposed me to various 
African dishes — my favorite 
being jollof — and African 
contemporary music, aspects 
of African culture that I would 
never have been exposed to 
otherwise. I now greatly desire 
to travel to Africa and uncover 
some more wonderful African 
culture. 
ASA 
also 
means 

community and friendship. I 
treasure the many relationships 
that I have built. Those in 
this organization are some of 
the most genuine, funny and 
talented people that I have ever 

met,” said Ethan Parker, LSA 
sophomore.

“ASA means the world to 

me. I’ve found people who 
understand me and who I can 
share my love of African culture 
with. ASA values educating 
and reaching the larger campus 
community 
about 
African 

culture, which is very important. 
My favorite event by far was the 
annual culture show. This year, 
I had the privilege to model in 
the fashion show. I had never 
modeled before, but it was such 
a great first experience! My 
friends without any ties to the 
African continent attended the 
culture show, and I was beaming 
with pride over the show we put 
together. Busting African myths 
in positive and engaging ways 
is what ASA is all about. I’m 
so glad I stopped by the ASA 
table in crowded FestiFall as a 
freshman because it’s made my 
Michigan experience special,” 
said Oluwatosin Adeyemi, LSA 
freshman.

“I see ASA as a community of 

people that are passionate about 
their African heritage and that 
want to be surrounded by other 
Africans and ultimately educate 
people on its rich culture. The 
culture show is definitely my 
favorite 
event 
because 
the 

members educate the audience 
about 
the 
African 
culture 

through clothing, informational 
videos and live performances,” 
said Kingsley Enechukwu, LSA 
freshman.

organizations at the University

at Columbia University, Chinese 
students experienced anti-Asian 
sentiments in their dormitories. 
Students 
with 
perceived 

Asian names had their name 
tags ripped off their doors. In 
response to this event, these 
students created a film about 
their experiences and created 
the hashtag #SayMyName to 
draw awareness to the incident 
and highlight the importance of 
their names.

We decided to organize a 

#SayMyName photo campaign 

and video interview in solidarity 
with the Chinese students at 
Columbia University. We are 
not attempting to equate our 
experiences with those of the 
Columbia students. Rather, in 
expanding 
the 
#SayMyName 

movement to the greater Asian/

hope to showcase the diversity 
of students who stand alongside 
those at Columbia University.

A

lmost five years ago, 
I attended freshman 
student 
orientation. 

I 
attended 
campus 
tours 

and 
backpacking 

sessions 
with 

peer 
advisors, 

learning 
about 

the myriad things 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
had 
to 

offer. 
I 
felt 
like 

a kid in a candy 
shop as I examined 
the 
massive 

array 
of 
student 

organizations, 
majors and course options. My 
new peers were impressive 
and intimidating, and the 
prospect of sharing classes 
with many of them was both 
exciting and overwhelming.

At 
orientation, 
the 

University of Michigan was 
novel and alien. I didn’t know 
what I would do here — what 
was I capable of and what 
I wanted to do were both 
questions that had yet to be 
answered. 

It 
didn’t 
take 
long 
for 

me to find my first role 
model — one of the peer 
advisors at an orientation 
backpacking 
session. 
She 

had just graduated from the 
University, and was headed to 
Northwestern University Law 
School the following fall. I 
was completely in awe of this 
person I barely knew.

At that time, I had nebulous 

aspirations of maybe becoming 
a lawyer someday. I didn’t know 
many lawyers, and certainly 
not female ones. But that peer 
advisor showed me what was 
possible if I worked hard and 
took advantage of the many 
opportunities the University 
offered. 
I 
left 
orientation 

feeling inspired and excited to 
start my college career.

But shortly after I moved 

into my first dorm room in 
the fall, I felt completely 
and utterly lost. Many of my 
hallmates 
seemed 
to 
have 

dozens of close friends from 
the first day of Welcome Week, 
and already knew what they 
wanted to major in and which 
student 
organizations 
they 

wanted to be participate in.

I met wonderful people 

and made lots of friends, but 
really missed the close bonds 
I had with my family and 
friends from high school. I 

loved my classes, 
but definitely didn’t 
have the next four 
years planned out. 
I attended meetings 
for 
student 

organizations, 
but 

didn’t feel like I had 
found my place on 
campus yet.

To be fair, I was 

only a few weeks into 
my college career at 

this point, so I wouldn’t exactly 
call this a crisis. But it seemed 
like my peers were already 
enjoying “the best four years of 
their lives,” and I wondered if I 
had made a mistake in coming 
to Michigan.

One day during that first 

semester, I wandered out of 
my 
dorm, 
across 
Maynard 

Street, and into the Student 
Publications Building. It was 
pretty and incredibly close, 
and I just wanted to see what it 
was like inside. A man told me 
to come back for The Michigan 
Daily’s 
information 
session 

later that night, and I did.

I went to the info session 

thinking I might like to be 
a Daily photographer. But 
after listening to the editorial 
page editors pitch EditBoard, 
the group of students that 
debates and writes the Daily’s 
editorials, I decided to join.

Joining Edit Board required, 

among other things, writing 
bylined op-eds from my own 
perspective in addition to the 
editorials written from the 
outline created by the entire 
group. My first op-ed changed 
my entire college experience.

Expressing my opinions in 

print taught me their value. It 
showed me that the thoughts 
in my own head — my voice, 
my unique way of thinking 
about the world — were worth 
sharing. In 650 words or less, I 
became more outspoken, self-
confident and self-aware.

I stopped viewing myself 

as one person in a sea of 
absurdly talented students, 
and started viewing myself 
as a writer with stories to tell 
— my stories, which I didn’t 

need to change or conform 
to anyone else’s ideology, 
experience or worldview.

I kept writing for the 

Daily. There are more than 
50 pieces with my name on 
them floating around the 
internet. Many have been 
well-received; 
others 
have 

stirred 
controversy 
and 

drawn criticism.

One of my earlier columns 

was posted on a blog read 
by people who, uh, didn’t 
quite agree with my message. 
They left dozens of angry 
comments, ridiculing me and 
my work. I’d be lying if I said 
I didn’t cry about it at the 
time. But if I had a running 
list of my best experiences 
in college, publishing that 
column would be on it. I grew 
more as a person from being 
the 
momentary 
target 
for 

angry internet trolls than I 
did from most classes I took at 
the University.

Some opinions and stances 

— whether on political issues 
like feminism or on ethical 
decisions 
at 
work 
— 
are 

unpopular and controversial. 
That doesn’t diminish their 
importance. 
Learning 
to 

stand up for causes I believe 
in has taught me how to stand 
up for myself — one of the 
most important things anyone 
can learn.

Above 
all, 
writing 
for 

the Daily helped me find a 
place for myself within a 
massive campus community. 
It gave me an identity and a 
sense of direction. The self-
confidence and sense of self 
I developed as a result paved 
the way for everything else 
I accomplished and decided 
to do at the University of 
Michigan. 

In a little over two weeks, 

I will walk across the stage 
at the Big House, officially 
concluding my time on this 
campus. In the fall, I’m going 
to attend a law school I never 
would’ve even dreamed of 
getting into five years ago. I’ll 
have to leave the home I’ve 
found at Michigan, but now I 
know how to build a new one.

 Your next hurdle should not be 
the end of the race. Of course, 
the completion of that midterm 
you’ve been agonizing over for 
weeks feels incredible. Finally 
turning in those internship 
applications 
that 
you 
told 

yourself you would have in 
by last Tuesday seems like a 
justification for celebration. 
But should we let that satisfy 
us completely? I don’t mean 
to say that we should not take 
pleasure in our successes; the 
joy derived from our dedication 
and 
accomplishments 
is 

necessary 
for 
progression 

and worthy of more emphasis 
than it can possibly receive. 
But when we begin to think 
of our next hurdle as the end 
of a sprint, we can easily tire 
ourselves out. 

What I mean by this is that 

we often lose sight of the 
bigger picture. Our upcoming 
presentations, 
projects 

and 
papers 
become 
our 

destinations. We say that we 
“just need to get through to the 
weekend.” The problem with 
this mentality is that it never 
ends. Once you’ve completed 
that midterm, you might feel 
content for the weekend, but 
dissatisfaction 
resurfaces 

before you know it, and you’re 
pining for the next break.

However, once we recognize 

that these challenges are just 
steps in the journey, we can 
maintain endurance. Instead 
of fatigue from the thought 
of running another race, we 

can take comfort in knowing 
we’ve taken a step in the 
right direction. We’re making 
progress.

This 
big-picture 

understanding also alleviates 
many of our fears. When 
we 
view 
every 
endeavor 

as 
an 
isolated 
trial, 
the 

fear of failure is immense. 
Everything depends on the 

upcoming race going our way. 
With a larger goal in mind, 
we leave ourselves room to 
improve. 
When 
we 
aren’t 

performing as well as we 
hoped to be, we have time left 
in the race to come back. In 
addition to this general relief, 
we perform better because we 
aren’t paralyzed by the fear 
of deeming our hard work 
worthless. 
All 
our 
efforts 

have value because we’re still 
heading in the right direction. 
The 
irreversible 
setbacks 

become amendable missteps.

With this in mind, we have a 

choice: We can conceptualize 
our race to success as isolated 
sprints, repeatedly starting 
and stopping, or as a cohesive 
pursuit. The cohesive pursuit 
doesn’t ensure your race will 
be shorter or less bumpy, but 
it does give you enthusiasm 
and 
stamina. 
You 
may, 

at times, feel that you’re 
moving at a glacial pace, 
but remember that you will 
start running again because 
you have momentum. This 
momentum can blur the lines 
of completion and tenacity.

Matthew 
McConaughey 

expressed this same idea in 
his 2014 Oscar acceptance 
speech when he discussed his 
response to being asked about 
his hero. At age 15, he said his 
hero was him in 10 years. At 
25, he said he wasn’t a hero. 
His hero was himself at 35. 
He was comfortable knowing 
he would never reach his goal 
because his ambitions always 
left him with “somebody to 
keep on chasing.”

So make big goals. When 

you 
near 
them, 
distance 

yourself from the finish line. 
That distance keeps you from 
stopping. 
And 
though 
the 

finish line may be invisible, 
when you look back, you 
can no longer see where you 
began, and you’ll know you’ve 
come a long way.

Never reach your destination

FROM THE DAILY

Continue to recognize our history
A 

series of seven pop-up art installations appeared around 
the University of Michigan’s Central, North and Medical 
Campuses between April 3 and April 8. The Stumbling 

Blocks exhibit, created by the Future University Community, was 
designed to reflect on and draw attention to problematic moments 
in the University’s history. The exhibit was included as part of the 
University’s bicentennial celebration to encourage the University 
community to reorient and reflect on its values and goals. The 
Michigan Daily Editorial Board commends the pop-up exhibit as 
a means for confronting the dubious history of the University and 
believes these reflections should become more regular, or even 
permanent, parts of our campus.

The interactivity of the 

Stumbling 
Blocks 
pieces 

created a unique foundation 
for dialogues across campus. 
The presence of self-reflective 
artwork on campus is crucial 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 

our 
past. 
By 
sponsoring 

self-critical 
work, 
the 

University took crucial steps 
to 
acknowledge 
historical 

issues 
that 
have 
impacted 

our campus and that some 
current University community 
members 
may 
have 
not 

otherwise known about. For 
example, the enlarged Native 
American Land Gift plaque 
drew attention to the fact that 
three Native American tribes 
gifted the University the land 
that it sits on, in the hopes 
that their children would be 
able to attend. Yet, for many 
years, very few, if any, Native 
American 
students 
were 

enrolled in the University. 
Many at the University may 
not have been aware of this 
essential 
context 
prior 
to 

observing the piece.

Furthermore, the exhibit 

was incredibly affective in 
nature, forcing observers to 
immediately feel connected 
to campus issues instead of 
listening to a set of facts in 
structured academic settings 
like lectures. One of the most 
visible portions of the exhibit 
was the 950 chairs in the Diag, 
representing the number of 

minority students that could 
not attend the University 
as a result of the state’s 
ban on gender- and race-
based affirmative action. We 
believe this resonated with 
community 
members 
more 

tangibly than simply sharing 
information on Proposal 2, 
a Michigan ballot initiative 
passed in 2006 that banned 
the use of gender- and race-
based affirmative action in 
admissions 
and 
was 
later 

ruled constitutional by the 
Supreme 
Court 
in 
2014. 

This 
tangible 
emotional 

connection makes the impacts 
of an abstract historical event 
more salient and powerful.

Nonetheless, we felt that by 

making the exhibit temporary, 
the University was not doing 
all it could to acknowledge 
its complex history and foster 
an 
important 
long-term 

conversation on the issues. 
The exhibits were only visible 
to people who happened to be 
on campus during a particular 
week, 
which 
may 
hamper 

their ability to create long-
lasting conversations on these 
important University issues.

The University community 

can learn from these exhibits 
going forward, by teaching 
us to reorient the way we 
display, think about and engage 
with campus issues. Pop-up 
installations, or other affective 
pieces, should become a more 

regular 
occurrence, 
so 
as 

to hold the University more 
accountable and better inform 
the campus population about 
our past pitfalls.

Furthermore, 
instead 
of 

simply 
disseminating 
the 

facts about these historical 
events through plaques, for 
example, 
there 
should 
be 

events or pieces created to 
catch our eyes and create 
unique 
interaction 
with 

historical 
issues. 
Students 

should also become more 
involved in the process of 
putting 
on 
these 
events 

and creating future pieces, 
as 
collaboration 
between 

University 
community 

members and the University 
itself is crucial to take strides 
to recognize our history. 

The University of Michigan 

community should be using 
its 
bicentennial 
to 
think 

about how we will move 
forward. Critically thinking 
about our past shortcomings 
is vital to informing our 
actions in the coming years. 
Using interactive exhibits, 
such as they did with the 
Stumbling Blocks art exhibit, 
creates a unique and engaging 
dialogue about this history 
throughout 
the 
campus 

community, and we implore 
the University to make these 
events and exhibits a staple 
of our community in the 
years to come.

doing?... This is wrong... Look at

When we begin 
to think of our 

next hurdle as the 

end of a sprint, 

we can easily tire 

ourselves out.

SMTD’s ‘Mermaid’ lends 
voice and scales to Power

Courtesy of SMTD’s Musical Theatre Department

SMTD to put on “The Little Mermaid” this weekend at the Power Center

The musical theatre department to put on acclaimed musical

The optimistic mermaid, the 

singing crab, the goofy flounder 
and the ominous octopus: the 
story and music of Disney’s 
classic “The Little Mermaid” has 
made a home for itself on VHS 
shelves everywhere. The timeless 
tale, filled with energy, vibrancy 
and thrill, will take its aquatic 
adventure from the screen to the 
stage with a production by SMTD’s 
Musical Theatre Department this 
weekend.

The Hans Christian Anderson 

tale made its way to Broadway in 
2008, where the musical firmly 
followed the same plot as the 1989 
Disney version.

As a story solely experienced 

through words and film before 
2008, a keen eye was needed in 
order to create the adaptation 
and bring it to life. Director and 
Choreographer of the show, and 
SMTD Associate Professor of 
Musical Theatre Linda Goodrich, 
described her experience working 
with children’s animation and 
how she applied those experiences 
to the University’s production.

“I 
worked 
on 
several 

Nickelodeon 
shows 
including 

Blue’s Clues and Dora the Explorer 
and employed similar processes 
in finding human characteristics 
for animals, use of puppetry and 
and vocabulary to create different 
environments,” Goodrich wrote 
in an email interview. “I feel very 
at home and delight in this kind of 
creation.”

Although 
“Mermaid” 
is 
a 

children’s story being performed 
at a university, it raises the 
concepts of maturity and coming 
of age. Goodrich found that one 
of the most difficult parts of 
directing the show was “finding 
the humanity and conflict in all 
of the characters while keeping 
the fun and humor of the animal 

world.”

Other than the well-know, 

catchy songs “Under the Sea” 
and “Kiss the Girl,” Goodrich 
additionally touched on the other 
major aspects of the musical, 
presenting more than just an 
elaborate and innocent children’s 
adventure.

“There are many very relevant 

themes in the show that I brought 
out as the director, but need to 
deliver them with whimsy and 
magic. For example, the conflict 
of a young girl/mermaid, whose 
mother was killed, whose father 
is trying to hold on to her, who has 
found love that is forbidden in her 
world, wanting to 
leave home –– while 
creating the physical 
world of a swimming 
mermaid,” 
she 

wrote.

Substantiating the 

idea of connecting 
adult 
themes 

to 
a 
children’s 

show, 
SMTD 

junior Sarah Lynn 
Marion 
described 

her 
perspective 

on 
playing 
the 

antagonist 
Ursula, 

who is one of the 
older characters in 
the play.

“She 
has 
a 

different backstory 
in the stage version,” 
Marion said. “She has an additional 
song that gives a little more detail 
about her family life, explaining 
a bit more about why she is the 
way she is … she’s not just some 
big scary octopus ... she’s broken, 
troubled, and misunderstood.”

Applying what she previously 

knew about the villain and 
what she learned throughout 
the process of playing the role, 
Marion discovered that Ursula 
not only taught her about how she 
personally perceives herself, but 
also the connection between the 

actress and a character with such 
a dynamic and dramatic persona.

“I 
really 
struggled 
with 

allowing myself to be as confident, 
body-positive, and powerful as she 
is, but the explorative and creative 
rehearsal process really allowed 
Ursula to dwell in me. Diving more 
and more into the many layers 
of her, I feel like she’s given me 
more confidence, body-positivity, 
and power on and off the stage,” 
Marion added.

By dissecting the characters’ 

personalities 
and 
backstories, 

designing over-the-top costumes 
and sets and overall interweaving 
creativity from the stage to the 

audience, 
the 

aspects of “The 
Little Mermaid” 
come 
together 

to 
create 
one 

overarching 
lesson: find your 
voice.

“The 

wonderful thing 
about 
Disney 

shows is that there 
are such a range 
of 
characters 

and 
points 
of 

view that every 
audience member 
of any age has 
someone that they 
can relate to … In 
this show almost 
every 
character 

is searching for their place in life 
and how to express themselves,” 
Goodrich explained. “There is a 
very literal message in this show 
of finding and asserting yourself in 
life: finding your voice and owning 
who you are.”

SMTD’s 
closing 
season 

performance 
of 
“The 
Little 

Mermaid” creates a space in which 
audience members can return 
to their childhood, the high-sea 
adventure of love, song and magic 
or even experience the journey in a 
new, mature light.

Student films were put on last Wednesday by M-agination
The M-agination Fest a 
diverse celebration of film

Student films presented at the Michigan vary in creativity

The movies of the M-agination 

Student 
Film 
Festival 
were 

hilarious, 
touching, 
beautiful, 

simple, filled with dumb jokes, 
kind 
of 
embarrassing, 
and 

delightful — all at the same time. 
The festival brought 16 films to 
a packed audience in the main 
screening room of the Michigan 
Theater, each of them made with 
clear enthusiasm and love for the 
craft.

The festival kicked off with 

“Cheater,” directed by LSA Junior 
Mike Boctor, which depicted with 
weird and wonderful accuracy 
the weird lengths people will 
go to to cheat on a test. Action 
movie music was used, people got 
stabbed in the eyes with pencils, 
the audience was shaking with 
laughter. Then there was the 
deeply strange “Jam,” directed by 
LSA Sophomore Gabriel Wolfe, 
about a serial killer who drank 

blood only the blood was jam. 
I think any more explanation 
would undercut the absurdist 
hilarity of the film, so we’ll leave 
it at that.

The highlight of the festival, 

though, was “Anna Garcia Does 
a One Woman Play,” directed 
by SMTD Senior Anna Garcia. 
It tells the story of the highly 
intense, 
overbearing 
and 

imaginative Anna Garcia as she 
browbeats her friends to come 
see her one-woman show. Filmed 
with a careful eye for well-framed 
shots, colorful and soft lighting, 
and edited with a precise sense of 
comic timing, “Anna Garcia” was 
just a genuinely good story. Not 
just good for a student film, but 
honestly engaging and well-told. 
The audience seemed to agree 
and greeted the film with wild 
applause.

There were some more somber 

outings as well — the beautifully 
filmed, 
voice-over 
heavy 

meditation on loneliness and 
youth as it relates to college that 

was LSA Junior Dylan Hancook’s 
“Millennia”; the tense exploration 
of a miserable relationship in 
LSA Senior Nikita Mungarwadi’s 
“Cracked”; and LSA Senior Clare 
Higgins’ experimental “Origins.” 
Some 
dabbled 
in 
classic 

genre constructions, like the 
meandering but well-intentioned 
sci-fi epidemic movie “CRISPR/
Cas-4,” directed by Engineering 
Junior Michael Mitchell Jr. Some 
films landed better than others, 
as expected, but since the festival 
was the result of a diverse and 
creative group of filmmakers, 
there was truly something for 
everyone.

As 
a 
celebration 
of 
the 

creativity and drive of a talented 
group of people, the M-agination 
Film Festival was undeniably a 
success. The room was filled with 
an enthusiastic and receptive 
audience who gave every movie 
its 
deserved 
attention. 
They 

laughed, 
they 
cheered, 
they 

sighed — and a good time was had 
by all.

Unexpected gratitude and

The

of 

expressing gratitude is perhaps 
more effectively shown than 
it is discussed, though I hope 
in bringing up the relevance 
of 
gratitude, 
we 
will 
feel 

encouraged to instigate change. 
The 
practice 
of 
constantly 

expressing our thankfulness 
for the circumstances of our 
lives and the people in our lives 
is lacking, and I believe this is 
because we all think there isn’t 
an apparent need to do so. To 
go out of our way to express 
how 
someone’s 

contributions 
to 
our 
lives 

have 
benefitted 

us 
seems 
— 

sentimental; in a 
way that we are 
not 
willing 
to 

offer very often, 
if at all.

We choose to 

thank 
someone 

if we are able to 
directly 
benefit 

or advance some 
other 
objective. 

It rarely happens 
solely for the sake 
of 
expressing 

deserved thanks 
to 
another 

person.

I’m sure many 

of you are aware that expressing 
gratitude actually carries a 
multitude of health benefits 
like 
increased 
optimism, 

stronger 
relationships 
and 

increased 
positivity 
toward 

upcoming 
short-term 
and 

long-term trials. I don’t think I 
should reduce the importance 
of gratitude to simply a benefit 
to your health.

I 
wish 
to 
discuss 
its 

importance so that hopefully 
it transforms from something 
that you maybe just think about 
to 
something 
that 
actually 

becomes instinctual.

Instead of just expecting, it 

should be a habit to thank. I see 
this most beautifully practiced 
in younger children. I volunteer 
at an elementary school in 

Detroit 
every 

Friday, and for 
the entire year 
I have worked 
with the same 
group of about 
five 
students. 

Last 
week 

was 
my 
last 

week 
working 

with 
them, 

and they were 
overwhelmingly 
grateful for the 
time I had spent 
with 
them. 
A 

few 
students 

saved up some 
money to buy 
me 
chocolate, 

they wrote me 
poems, 
notes, 

cards — all of 

this as an outpour of thanks for 
coming in to assist in reading 
and writing.

Why is it that kids know to 

do this, but many of us who are 
older fail to express our praise? 
Children act as though they 

are naturally prone to express 
thanks, maybe because they 
are more dependent on the 
guidance and help from others. 
While evaluating gratitude on 
a larger scale, I have come to 
realize that some of the most 
privileged and most successful 
are also the most unwilling 
to give thanks. Instead, they 
credit themselves. They think: 
“I’m the reason I have made it 
to this place and I’m the one to 
thank.”

It moves me to see that 

children are humble enough to 
greet me with grace and praise 
simply because they 
want to. For them, it is 
instinctual.

When 
I 
was 
a 

senior in high school, 
I applied to be the 
commencement 
speaker 
for 
my 

graduation 
and 

wrote 
a 
speech 

that expressed this 
sentiment. 
Among 

the 
competition 
of 

all of the students who wanted 
to leave our senior class with 
some 
inspirational 
send-off, 

I was not selected to give my 
gratitude talk a go.

My 
speech 
was 
derived 

from this statement: “Before 
we graduate and move on 
to the next chapter of our 
lives, we have look back with 
appreciation and thanks to 
those who got us here.”

Maybe some of you have just 

begun your college journey. 

Others of you are on your way 
out. Maybe you’re reading this 
far removed from your life in 
college. Look at where you 
are right now, at this point 
in your life, and think about 
every single person who made 
it possible to be here. Some of 

the obvious figures 
that come to mind are 
parents, 
educators 

and mentors. But in 
further consideration, 
I think of many more 
people.

I have to consider 

those who maintain 
the 
facilities 
that 

make it possible for me 
to enjoy everything 
this University has 
to offer. The people 

who were willing to write me 
recommendation letters, which 
gave me the opportunity to apply 
to some amazing programs. 
People I see everyday, like my 
peers, who have given me advice 
and support, as well as friends in 
graduate school who constantly 
offer me insight to what their 
experiences are like, helping me 
to make decisions toward my 
own future.

While considering all who 

have made it possible for you to 

be where you are — I ask that 
before your gaze becomes too 
fixed on what is ahead, look 
back and consider how their 
contributions have allowed for 
your advancement. 

This 
isn’t 

a 
ridiculous 

request — there 
are 
moments 

when 
we 
see 

this 
practice 

in our culture. 
When you watch 
an award show, 
every 
single 

person 
who 

wins something 
walks up to the 
microphone 
and 
profusely 

thanks everyone 
who 
helped 

him or her on 
the 
journey 

to 
success. 
If 

any 
of 
those 

individuals 
walked up to the 
microphone and said: “Thank 
you, I want to thank myself 
and my talent for winning this 
award,” the audience would 
likely be outraged. They would 
think: “How dare this person 
take 
such 
credit 
for 
their 

accomplishment?”

Maybe your success isn’t as 

publicized, but the expectation 
to express gratitude still exists. 
If you walk around thinking 
that you don’t owe anyone 

thanks, 
or 
that 

it isn’t necessary 
to express it, you 
are 
the 
person 

grabbing 
your 

trophy 
and 

thanking yourself.

Many of you are 

exceptional people 
on your way to 
abundant success. 
Don’t fool yourself 
into 
thinking 

you’ve reached a 
certain point that 
no longer requires 
you 
to 
humbly 

thank those who 
have 
contributed 

to such a life.

What I wasn’t 

able to say to the 

senior class of 2014, I will send 
you off with now: As you look 
ahead, make sure to also look 
back, for the people behind you 
are very much responsible for 
getting you to where you now 
stand.

‘Smurfs’ is more bearable 
than its bad predecessors

COLUMBIA PICTURES

Still from the latest “Smurfs”

The anticipated sequel to the hit animated movie proves mediocre

“Smurfs: The Lost Village” 

is marginally more sufferable 
than the live-action / CGI 
films that came out in the 
early 2010s, which is to say, 
this movie will not make 
parents leave their children 
unattended in a movie theater 
while they sprint outside for 
fresh air after every scene. It’s 
not a pleasant experience for 
anyone above the age of five, 
and the dearth of original ideas 
is exhausting, but for those 
preparing themselves for the 
worst, rest easy. “Smurfs: The 
Lost Village” is not terrible. 
It’s only bad.

The 
thing 
is, 
there’s 
a 

moving idea at the core of 
“The Lost Village”: Smurfette 

(Demi Lovato, “Camp Rock”), 
a Smurf created by evil wizard 
Gargamel (Rainn 
Wilson, 
“The 

Office”), has an 
identity 
crisis. 

She 
sees 
the 

naturally-created 
boys 
around 

her 
comfortable 

in 
their 
own 

skin and wants 
something similar, but she 
worries that her origin means 
she’ll only ever be meant 
for evil. That’s a potentially 
powerful character arc, and 
when writers Stacey Harman 
(“The Goldbergs”) and Pamela 
Ribon (“Moana”) tap into it, 
it results in some of the most 
poignant scenes “The Lost 
Village” has to offer.

The voice cast also has 

talent to spare. Wilson puts 
his comedic chops to good 

use, and the four jokes that 
work do so because of him. 

Mandy Patinkin 
(“Homeland”) is 
put to little use as 
Papa Smurf, but 
when he is given 
his due near the 
film’s 
end, 
he 

absolutely 
nails 

it, carrying the 
most 
emotional 

scenes of the film. The most 
shocking part of the cast may 
be the minor characters, which 
includes vocal performances 
by “New Girl” stand-out Jake 
Johnson as Grumpy Smurf and 
Tituss Burgess (“Unbreakable 
Kimmy Schmidt”) as Vanity 
Smurf. The two feel underused 
as 
mere 
stunt 
casting, 

especially considering they’re 
the funniest members of the 
ensemble.

The 
rest 
of 
the 
movie 

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM

Daily Arts Writer

plays like “The Smurfs Go 
to Pandora.” The fantastical 
setting is cool at first but upon 
inspection reveals itself to 
be an (even more) animated 
knock-off of the setting of 
“Avatar.” The story doesn’t fare 
much better. After the early 
Smurfette-centric 
scenes, 

the core group of Smurfs 
ventures into the forest to find 
something that Smurfette saw 
earlier. The result is a plotline 
certain to be the subject of 
much ire on meninist message 
boards.

The 
ensuing 
message 

of 
female 
empowerment 

is 
welcome, 
but 
it 
isn’t 

communicated 
in 
any 

interesting 
way. 
It 
winds 

up being a “battle of the 
sexes” like every movie of 
this type (see: “Alvin and the 
Chipmunks: The Squeakquel”) 
but 
blessedly 
abbreviated 

here. 
The 
accompanying 

score is occasionally pretty, 
but 
director 
Kelly 
Asbury 

(“Gnomeo & Juliet”) often goes 
to the well of generic, outdated 

pop songs like “Blue (Da Ba 
Dee).” Get it? Because the 
Smurfs are blue.

Besides Smurfette and Papa 

Smurf, the characters hold 
no weight either. The Smurfs 

are fundamentally one-note. 
Their personalities are able to 
be defined by one word, and 
because of that, it’s hard to 
care about them or laugh at 
any of the jokes derived from 
their traits. Clumsy Smurf 
(a 
perpetually 
screaming 

Jack McBrayer, “30 Rock”) 
is clumsy. Ha. Nosey Smurf 
(Asbury) is a voyeur. Ha. 

Brainy Smurf (Danny Pudi, 
“Community”) is a nerd, but in 
a bizarre series of jokes, seems 
to have murderous impulses, 
which in a modern cinematic 
climate, seems an idea destined 
to be the inspiration for a dark 
and gritty “Smurfs” reboot, 
presumably helmed by Zack 
Snyder. It’s just hard to care 
about any of them when they 
have to stay within boundaries 
defined by a single adjective.

Aside from its work on 

Smurfette, “Smurfs: The Lost 
Village” doesn’t do anything 
original or interesting. It lacks 
a strong story or sense of humor 
– at one point, Gargamel French 
kisses 
his 
vulture, 
Monty, 

because kids love bestiality. 
Its old characters are as flat 
as ever, and the new ones it 
introduces have their own 
shticks that are driven into the 
ground within thirty seconds. 
It’s all vastly preferable to the 
hybrid animation dreck from a 
few years ago, but that doesn’t 
make it recommendable to any 
but the youngest of children.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Renowned literary critic 
to promote newest book 

Literary critic and author Steven Moore to present selections 
from his new work “Mr Back Pages” this coming Monday

Following his two-volume 

venture 
“The 
Novel: 
An 

Alternative History,” in which 
he surveyed the innermost 
roots of literature, author and 
literary critic Steven Moore 
has come out with a newer, 
fresher take on the written 
word.

“It’s 
mostly 
about 

innovative fiction of the late 
20th century,” Moore wrote 
about his upcoming book, 
“My 
Back 
Pages: 
Essays 

and Reviews,” in an email 
interview. 
“The 
first 
half 

consists of a couple hundred 
book reviews written over the 
last 40 years and the second 
half about two dozen essays.”

While not officially the 

third 
volume, 
“My 
Back 

Pages” serves as somewhat of 
a final installment to Moore’s 
exploration of the history of 
the novel.

“I didn’t have the energy 

to write the huge concluding 
volume 
on 

modern 
fiction 

that I intended,” 
Moore 
wrote. 

“So I decided it 
might 
be 
time 

to 
gather 
all 

my 
scattered 

writings into one 
convenient place. 
As I assembled 
them, I realized 
that 
I 
had 

already 
written 

about many of 
the novelists I 
planned to cover 
in 
that 
final 

volume, so this new book is 
sort of a surrogate for that 
unwritten third volume.”

Moore’s 
writing 
is 

reflective of his untraditional 
approach to literary criticism. 
He 
started 
his 
collegiate 

studies as a history major, 
and this background is seen 
as he strays from theoretical 
styles, opting instead for more 
historical angles on fiction.

“I was more concerned with 

locating modern writers in the 
continuum of literary history, 
and 
drawing 

attention to the 
little-known 
ones, rather than 
deconstructing 
their 
work,” 

Moore said.

Having played 

in several bands 
throughout 
college, 
popular culture 
references 
and 

glimmers 
of 

folk-inspired 
idiosyncrasy 
shine 
through 

in 
Moore’s 

work. His texts 
are casual and 
attainable 
for 

contemporary 
audiences.

“The music of 

the 1960s was 
my 
first 
love, 

especially 
the 
innovative 

lyrics of Bob Dylan, Jim 
Morrison, Robin Williamson 
(of 
the 
Incredible 
String 

Band), 
Syd 
Barrett, 
and 

Keith 
Reid 
(of 
Procol 

Harum),” Moore wrote. “So 
when I turned to literature 
I 
carried 
their 
sensibility 

with me: their fanciful use 
of language, their alternative 
worldviews, their iconoclasm 
and 
nonconformity, 
their 

willingness to be different. 
I’m not your typical literary 
critic (no academic affiliation, 

bookselling background), and 
I owe part of that to them.”

An avid listener, writer 

and thinker, Moore is, above 
all else, an ardent reader. He 
holds a Ph.D. from Rutgers 
University, 
for 
which 
his 

dissertation 
on 
William 

Gaddis (“William 
Gaddis”) 
was 

published 
in 

1989. 
Drawn 

to 
him 
from 

shared interests 
in 
mythology 

and religion, he 
resonated 
with 

Gaddis’s 
works 

and 
the 
ways 

in 
which 
he 

resembled James 
Joyce, an author 
Moore 
deeply 

admired in his 
20s.

“Since hardly 

anything had been written 
about him (Gaddis), I decided 
to rectify that. Both my first 
published article and first 
book were on Gaddis,” Moore 
said. “I liked his style, his 
outlook on life, his humor 
and sarcasm, his encyclopedic 
range — he was Mr. Right as 
far as my literary tastes were 
concerned.”

Now 
a 
prominent 
force 

in 
the 
realm 
of 
literary 

criticism, Moore encourages 
burgeoning writers to do the 

unthinkable: to 
be themselves.

“Before 
I 

began 
writing 

the 
first 

volume of my 
novel 
history, 

I 
assumed 

I 
would 
be 

writing 
it 

in 
standard 

academese, and 
dragged my feet 
because I had 
grown 
tired 

of that style,” 
Moore 
said. 

“Then one day 
I just decided 
to write it in 
my own voice, 
quirks 
and 

all, 
and 
the 

floodgates 
of 

creativity burst 
open. I dashed 
off the 36-page 

introduction in a week, and I 
think it’s that personal tone 
that separates my criticism 
from the academic variety. 
Similarly, my favorite writers 
are those with a distinctive, 
even eccentric voice of their 
own.” 

Moore has been living in 

Ann Arbor since 2001. If you 
haven’t 
seen 
him 
around 

Hatcher, where he’s done the 
bulk of his research for the 
past 16 years, you can catch 
him 
promoting 
“My 
Back

‘M’ to face test in
No. 18 Oklahoma

The 
Michigan 
baseball 

team has yet to claim a victory 
over a ranked opponent, but 
Thursday, that 
could change 
when No. 18 
Oklahoma 
travels to Ann 
Arbor 
for 
a 

three-game 
bout 
this 

weekend. 

“I think it’s 

going to be like 
a heavyweight 
fight,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich. 
“I 

think 
it’s 

going to be two very good teams 
going at it.”

The Sooners (5-4 Big 12, 

27-9 overall) will certainly be 
a challenge, despite Michigan 
steamrolling 
through 
its 

competition to win 10 of its past 
11 matchups and claim a third-
place standing in the Big Ten.

Oklahoma boasts a solid 

record in a tough conference, 
highlighted by two wins over 
No. 6 Texas Tech two weeks 
ago.

Still, 
the 
13th-ranked 

Wolverines (6-3 Big Ten, 26-7 
overall) sport a high-octane 
offense that boasts a .292 overall 
batting average with 329 hits 
and 205 runs batted in total on 
the season so far, capping off an 
impressive start to the season.

However, 
Oklahoma 
has 

similarly exhibited a strong 
showing on offense with a .284 
cumulative 
batting 
average 

with 334 hits and 209 RBI led 
by catcher Renae Martinez with 
a .355 batting average.

What sets the Sooners apart 

from the Wolverines, though, 
is their powerful pitching staff. 
Michigan has had incredible 
success from the mound with 
a 3.08 combined earned-run 

average. Oklahoma’s 2.73 ERA 
shows that the Wolverines’ bats 
will have to prove their worth 
in order to scrap hits from the 
Sooners. Jake Irvin spearheads 
their pitching staff with a 1.30 
ERA over 34.2 innings-pitched.

Just as Bakich hinted at, the 

matchup will be a showcase of 
a high-caliber pitching squad in 
Oklahoma against a Michigan 
offense that has consistently 
arisen 
in 
pressure-cooker 

situations and has stayed hot all 
season.

The Wolverines are fresh 

off a win against Eastern 
Michigan 
on 
Tuesday 
in 

which sophomore right fielder 
Jonathan Engelmann launched 
a walk-off double in the 13th 
inning to grant Michigan the 
victory.

On 
Sunday, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines dropped their final 
matchup against Illinois, 5-7, in 
a game marred by 11 forfeited 
hits.

If Michigan wants success 

against its first real challenge of 
the season, it will need to stymie 
the cooling of its offense in 
the past two games, especially 
against the Sooners, who will 
take advantage of any sacrifice 
of opportunity.

The Wolverines will likely 

turn 
to 
sophomore 
second 

baseman Ako Thomas, who 
claims a .346 batting average, 
and junior third baseman Drew 
Lugbauer, who claims 42 RBI, 
continue to perform the way 
they have been.

On paper, it will be the 

toughest test Michigan has 
faced to this point, and perhaps 
the toughest test it will face 
the rest of the season — the 
Wolverines have no ranked 
opponents on their schedule. 
In order to accomplish this tall 
task, they will have to prove 
they deserve their own ranking.

As Bakich put it: “You look at 

it and you say, ‘Okay, yeah, this 
is going to be a very good test, a 
very good challenge.’ ”

Falk, Wolverines top Michigan State

By keeping her mind free of 

distraction, Aidan Falk continues 
to show up when it counts.

After going 6-for-9 at Ohio 

State last weekend, the junior 
right fielder put out another 
stellar effort Wednesday. She 
notched two doubles and three 
RBI en route to a 5-1 win for 
the Michigan softball team (9-1 
Big Ten, 29-8-1 overall) against 
Michigan State (5-5, 21-13) during 
a game moved to Alumni field due 
to flooding in East Lansing.

“I’ve been trying to see the ball 

and swing more freely, getting it 
off the brain,” Falk said.

Following consecutive singles 

in the first inning, Falk launched 
a double to the left-center field 
gap to give No.18 Michigan a 2-0 
advantage and, ultimately, its 
game-winning runs.

She would again knock an RBI 

double in the third frame, as two 
Spartans collided on a Falk flare 
to left field, allowing a runner to 
score.

Leading the team with 14 

doubles, Falk has been a staple of 
the Wolverines’ offense all season. 
But contrary to her foothold in 
the batting order, she has found 
herself in a new spot defensively.

With 
senior 
right-hander 

Megan Betsa and first baseman 
Tera Blanco in the lineup, Falk 
has been relegated to starting 
in the outfield — a place she 
played for just the first time this 
season last month. She was again 
penciled into the right field spot 
against Michigan State.

But 
Falk’s 
performance 

Wednesday shows exactly why 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
calls the junior’s offense the most 
versatile aspect of her game — 
rather than her ability to play yet 
another new position.

Falk’s “versatility,” stemming 

from her ability to keep her mind 
clear in the batter’s box, has now 
become a focus for the rest of the 
Wolverines.

“A lot of us have gone toward 

that now,” Falk said. “We know 
how to play the game, so turn 
off the brain and stop thinking. 

We all know how to hit, it’s just a 
matter of our minds getting in the 
way.”

Clear minds seemed to be 

the case for sophomore second 
baseman 
Faith 
Canfield 
and 

junior designated player Amanda 
Vargas too, who each added 
RBIs of their own. Sophomore 
left fielder Natalie Peters also 
smacked three singles.

But it could have been a much 

larger margin of victory for 
Michigan. 

It left seven runners on base, 

including three in the third inning 
and two in the fourth inning. In 
the former, senior shortstop Abby 
Ramirez’s groundout helped the 
Spartans escape the frame having 
surrendered just two runs. An 
inning later, with runners on 
second and third with one out, 
consecutive strikeouts left the 
Wolverines empty handed.

In the circle, senior right-

hander Megan Betsa was once 
again victorious, striking out 17 
batters — tying her career high — 
and allowing only one run.

But the road to her 15th win 

of the season was bumpier than 
usual. 

After surrendering two walks 

and a hit to load the bases in the 
fifth inning, Betsa found herself 
with Michigan State’s best hitter 
at the plate — Leah Foerster — 
who looked to drive in the game-
tying run.

Betsa buckled down to strike 

out the next two batters, however, 
eliminating the Spartans’ best 
offensive chance all evening.

Even more impressive was how 

Betsa finished the contest, retiring 
her last eight outs on strikes.

“She’s been more consistent 

this year,” Hutchins said. “She’s 
our leader, and that’s one of the 
things we need from her. She 
needs to give us that sense of ‘I’ll 
get it done until the offense gets it 
done.’ ”

In Falk and Betsa, Michigan 

had some of its usual candidates 
leading the charge.

And for Falk to continue her 

hitting streak and possibly the 
Wolverines’ dominance in the 
Big Ten, it’s just about keeping 
softball off the brain.

Junior right fielder Aidan Falk notched two doubles and three RBI against Michigan State, further proving how valuable her bat is to Michigan’s lineup.

Hutchins helps Betsa
in fifth-inning trouble

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins 
walked 
in 
silence 

to the pitching circle in the 
bottom of the fifth inning to 
talk to her senior right-hander 
Megan Betsa. The PA speakers 
remained hushed.

“I had said before the game, 

we were wondering whether I 
have a walk-out song when I go 
to the mound,” Hutchins said. 

“So when I went out there, 

I asked her ‘What are they 
playing?’ 
and 
(Betsa) 
goes 

‘Nothing.’ … Then one came on 
and I said ‘What’s this song, this 
is not my song’ and she agreed 
it’s not my song. So we came to 
the conclusion that I don’t have 
one.”

At 
that 
point, 
Betsa’s 

command was teetering, with 
back-to-back 
walks 
bringing 

the tying run to the plate for 
the Spartans. After a single by 
catcher Lindsay Besson loaded 
the bases and brought a vocally 
dormant Michigan State dugout 
to life, the Wolverines’ 4-1 lead 
appeared vulnerable.

Perhaps more importantly, 

though, so did Betsa.

Hutchins’ visit — in contrast 

to one from pitching coach Jen 
Brundage — signaled a mental 
fix rather than a physical one. Up 
to that point, Betsa was cruising, 
with a bloop single serving as 
the only real blemish on her day 
to that point. Hutchins knew 
what Betsa needed, and knew a 
light-hearted conversation was 
all it would take for her to regain 
focus and escape the jam.

The senior ace has been 

adamant about her improved 
confidence 
this 
season 
— 

something she says she “had in 
the past, but… I don’t know if 
I’ve ever actually had this type 
of confidence.” 

But here was real adversity. 

With the bases loaded in a 
crucial midweek tilt against a Big 
Ten foe, even the most confident 
of pitchers would be fazed.

It was a test of her mental 

acuity in a pressure situation; 
a test Betsa passed with flying 
colors.

It was like Hutchins turned 

on a light only she could 
activate, 
as 
Betsa 
quickly 

mowed down Michigan State’s 
pinch hitter Jordan Davis to 
set up a showdown with the 
Spartans’ star centerfielder Lea 
Foerster.

Foerster came into the game 

boasting team-highs in batting 
average (.420), home runs (9) 
and slugging percentage (.870). 
In addition, she had just three 
strikeouts all season. Foerster 
had already singled in the third 
inning to account for Michigan 
State’s only run on the day, and 
the first run Betsa has allowed at 
Alumni Field all season.

But this time, Betsa came out 

on top, dialing a 2-2 fastball past 
Foerster to get the last out of 
the inning, stranding all three 
runners on base and preserving 
the 4-1 lead.

“She pitched herself into the 

jam and she pitched herself out,” 
Hutchins said. “And what’s the 
approach? Do what you do. Spin 
the ball. When you spin the ball, 
you’re really hard to hit.”

Betsa stayed in the groove, 

striking out the side in the sixth 
inning and the seventh inning 
en route to a complete-game, 17 
strikeout performance.

“I think she threw really well 

today,” said sophomore catcher 
Katie Alexander. “Even though 
she got deeper into the count… I 
think she did well fighting back 
from that.”

All it took was a casual 

conversation with her coach 
— no mechanical tweaks or 
background music necessary — 
to get the job done.

Wilson, Wagner take different paths to draft

As 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team gathered with 
family and friends to celebrate the 
past season, two of its players were 
looking forward to an exciting, yet 
uncertain future.

Sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson both declared 
for the NBA Draft on Monday. But 
both players opted to do so without 
hiring agents, leaving the door 
open for a possible return to Ann 
Arbor for the 2017-18 season.

In the weeks that followed 

the Wolverines’ Sweet 16 loss to 
Oregon, Wagner and Wilson spoke 
with family, the Michigan coaching 
staff and consulted with reports 
from the NBA Advisory Committee 
to make an informed decision on 
their respective futures.

“After we got all the facts — we 

got great input from the Advisory 
Committee — and they looked at 
those facts and I encouraged them 
to look at this aggressively and go 
after it,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “Don’t go into this if you’re 
not going after it all.”

Beilein has yet to have an 

underclassmen declare for the 
draft since the new rules were 
established two seasons ago. They 
allow younger players to ‘test the 
waters’ and go through the NBA 
Draft Combine, interviews and 
workouts before making a final 
decision to go pro. So the process 
Wilson and Wagner will be going 
through the next couple months is 
just as new to Beilein as it is to his 
two players.

“It’s so new to so many different 

people,” Beilein said. “Everybody’s 
learning, because it’s like a game. 
You throw a game up and are they 
zone? Are they man? Are they 
pressing? Are they not? Are they 
overplaying? Are they not? And it’s 
the same thing we deal with when 
we talk about their futures.”

Just like preparing for any game, 

Wilson and Wagner will be treating 
the draft process the same way — 
working out regularly, checking the 

tape and gathering any information 
out there — despite the different 
end goal.

Beilein says he believes both 

forwards will receive invites to 
next month’s NBA Draft Combine 
in Chicago, and that will be the 
greatest source of information 
for both of them as they make the 
decision.

The final deadline to pull out 

of the draft is May 24, and neither 
Wilson nor Wagner have any idea 
if it will take that long for them to 
make the final commitment to stay 
or go.

As for how events will transpire 

between now and the deadline, 
Wilson and Wagner seem to have 
different approaches on how they 
each attack the draft process.

Wilson said he started thinking 

about his potential NBA prospects 
as early as the beginning of the 
season, when coaches began to 
instill the confidence in him that 
with a breakout season he could get 
on some teams’ radars.

Within the past few weeks, 

Wilson has reached out to the 
likes of Marquese Chriss, Kelly 
Oubre Jr., Stanley Johnson and Ben 
Gordon about the draft process and 
life in the NBA.

Based on early feedback and 

the conversations he has had with 
coaches and current NBA players, 
Wilson realizes at this point he 
should be focused on working 
out and improving all areas of his 
game, rather than focusing on just 
his strengths or weaknesses.

“I think it’s just working on 

my overall game, working on 
everything,” Wilson said on where 
he’s looking to focus on improving 
in the coming weeks. “I can get 
better in all facets of the game, so 
there’s not really one particular 
area where I’m gonna key in on 
more.”

As for Wagner, his focus has 

been much narrower, as he’s only 
recognized himself as a viable 
prospect for a few weeks now, 
unlike Wilson.

“As a basketball player, you don’t 

think that far (ahead),” Wagner 
said. “You’re not successful if you 

don’t focus on the next thing. I’ll 
focus on preparing for the workout 
and for the combine and then we’ll 
see.”

Wagner has talked to former 

Michigan guard Caris LeVert and 
some other individuals he knows 
back from when he played in 
Germany. He says that from what 
he’s learned, moving onto the 
NBA will be nothing like what he’s 
experienced in Ann Arbor the past 
two years and completely different 
from the experiences he went 
through playing for his professional 
club — ALBA Berlin — through his 
prep days in Germany.

The sophomore has also been 

planning for the summer as if 
he’s staying at Michigan. Wagner 
believes he’s going to attend 
summer workouts in Ann Arbor 
and enroll in spring-term classes.

Neither Wilson nor Wagner will 

commit to saying if they’re leaning 
one way or another in terms of 
staying or leaving. Right now, the 
pair is focused on learning as much 
as they can about how well their 
games can carry over to the next 
level and if they personally are 
ready to bear the responsibility of 
NBA life.

While it may be agonizing for 

others waiting for their decision, 
Wilson and Wagner are taking 
solace in knowing they have 
time to make what could be the 
biggest decision of their lives, and 
are confident whatever way they 
choose to go will be the best choice 
for them.

“I have no idea what I’m going to 

do,” Wilson said. “As of right now, 
I’m a Michigan Wolverine. Ask 
me in a few weeks and that might 
be different. But right now, I don’t 
know.”

Offseason report: ‘M’ could lose up to four starters

A year ago, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team lost four 
players — one to the NBA and 
three to transfers — and coach 
John Beilein had to rebuild part 
of the team that would eventually 
win the Big Ten Tournament and 
make the NCAA Tournament 
Sweet Sixteen. 

But the Wolverines’ success 

has brought about some changes 
in the current makeup of the 
team, which may force Beilein 
to 
rebuild 
in 

Ann Arbor once 
again.

The 
Daily 

breaks down all 
of 
Michigan’s 

roster movement 
so 
far 
this 

offseason 
and 

potential moves 
the Wolverines 
have been linked 
to so far.

The Departed:
Leaving the team is a class of 

five seniors in guards Derrick 
Walton Jr. and Andrew Dakich, 
forward Mark Donnal and wings 
Sean Lonergan and Zak Irvin.

Walton 
and 
Irvin 
played 

significant minutes as four-year 
starters and will both look to 
get their names called when the 
NBA Draft comes around. Irvin 
was invited and will attend the 
Portsmouth Invitational, an NBA 
Draft showcase, this weekend.

Currently, in multiple mock 

drafts, neither is projected to be 
picked.

Donnal and Dakich each have a 

year left of eligibility after Dakich 
redshirted this past season and 
Donnal redshirted his freshman 
year. Both are looking at graduate 
transfer opportunities to play one 
more season of college basketball.

The Almost Departed:
Monday, 
both 
sophomore 

forward Moritz Wagner and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 

DJ Wilson declared for the 
NBA Draft. The stipulation is 
that neither hired an agent and 
returning to the Wolverines is a 
possibility.

Both big men likely played 

themselves into the NBA Draft 
with their exceptional play in the 
postseason, showcased by Wilson 
averaging almost 16 points per 
game and Wagner putting up a 
career-high 26 points against 
Louisville.

The duo both showed an ability 

to 
stretch 
the 

floor with 3-point 
shooting, and it’s 
a trait that has 
made Wilson and 
Wagner attractive 
options for NBA 
teams.

The 
declared 

draftees will have 
until May 24th to 
make a decision 
about whether to 

stay in the NBA Draft or not.

Incoming Recruits:
The Wolverines currently have 

three players in their incoming 
freshman class in guards Eli 
Brooks and Jordan Poole and 
forward Isaiah Livers. Poole is 
the highest ranked of the three, 
coming in at No. 88 nationally, 
and will look to push junior guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rakhman 
at the ‘2’ for playing time.

“I think he’s gone from 20, 

30-something assists to 40 or 50, 
now 60 or 70 — I forget what his 
final number was,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “… But yes, he 
can play there, he can guard that 
position.” 

Brooks will slide into the 

position freshman point guard 
Xavier Simpson played this year 
as backup point guard, but could 
push for starting minutes if 
Simpson struggles.

 “Eli (can) definitely (play) 

point and ‘2’,” Beilein said. 
“Jordan can play probably more 
‘2’ or ‘3’, but could be a back up 
point in time. He’s got to work 
on some areas there, but he can 
pass.”

Livers 
recently 
won 
Mr. 

Basketball in Michigan and will 
add depth to the Wolverines’ 
depleted frontcourt.

Michigan is also still in the 

running 
for 
5-star 
forward 

Mohammad 
Bamba. 
Bamba, 

who is the No. 3 prospect in 
the country, has shown himself 
to be dominant inside with a 
long wingspan that makes him 
versatile on both ends of the 
floor. Additionally, the 6-foot-11 

forward has shown the ability to 
shoot from beyond the arc.

Currently, Bamba is down to 

four schools: Duke, Kentucky, 
Michigan and Texas.

If Bamba decides on another 

school, the Wolverines could 
turn to 6-foot-4 guard Shakwon 
Barrett. Barrett has not been 
offered a scholarship yet.

Possible Transfers:
With Wilson and Wagner both 

leaving, their departures will 
leave two more roster spots open. 
One way Beilein could fill the void 
is with graduate transfers who 
would be able to play right away.

Michigan has been linked 

with three such players so far 

in Pittsburgh guard Cameron 
Johnson, Wright State forward 
Mark Alstork and Howard guard 
James Daniel III.

Johnson averaged 11.9 points 

per game last season with the 
Panthers and has a long list of 
suitors including Ohio State, 
Arizona and South Carolina, 
among a multitude of other 
schools. Johnson would have two 
years of eligibility left.

Alstork put up 19 points, 4.7 

rebounds and 3.5 assists per game 
last season at Wright State, and 
there is some familiarity with 
assistant coach Billy Donlon, who 
coached the Rowdy Raiders last 
season.

Alstork has emphasized that he 

is focusing on the NBA Draft first. 
But if that doesn’t pan out, he will 
go the graduate transfer route. 
And if he does, he’ll have a full list 
of interested teams from across 
the country looking for his ability.

Daniel is the most recent 

player Michigan has been linked 
to. While Daniel missed all but 
two games of the 2016-17 season, 
including a loss in Ann Arbor 
back in early November, he has a 
proven record. During the 2015-
16 season, Daniel led the NCAA 
with 27 points per game.

Daniel is down to a final four 

schools of DePaul, Michigan, 
Ohio State and Tennessee.

Daily Sports Editor

Wagner and Wilson choose to test NBA waters, leave Beilein with possibility of only one returning starter

“He can play 
there, he can 
guard that 
position.”

Kemp prepared to capitalize
on return to natural position

Carlo 
Kemp 
joined 
the 

Michigan football team as an 
early enrollee in January 2016. 
Though he was just 18 years 
old and playing defensive end, 
new defensive coordinator Don 
Brown decided to try him out at 
linebacker instead.

The idea didn’t exactly pan 

out.

As the rising sophomore 

explained after spring practice 
Tuesday, his first week as a 
Wolverine was ‘pretty rough.’

“I would have traded him 

away for two used footballs,” 
Kemp recalled Brown saying 
about him a year later.

Added Kemp: “I probably 

would have done the same.”

Coming out of high school 

as the No. 42 defensive end in 
the nation according to the 
ESPN300 
rankings, 
it 
was 

expected that he would be 
called upon to play his natural 
position.

Without 
proper 
training 

at linebacker, Kemp simply 
couldn’t keep up.

“I was kind of thrown into 

the fire,” Kemp said. “I didn’t 
really 
know 

anything 
that 

Brown 
was 

saying: ‘Follow 
the 
pulling 

guard, 
watch 

the 
tackle, 

stare into the 
backfield.’ 
… 

I’m 
used 
to 

looking at the 
tackle 
and, 

when he moves, 
I go.”

He came to Michigan at 

260 pounds — the weight of 
a forceful run stopper on the 
line — and had to drop to 250 
in order to play the more agile 
linebacker role. He did it in a 
week.

The weight loss didn’t fix his 

core issues, though. With his 
first few days as a Wolverine 
not going according to plan, 

doubt began to creep into his 
mind. 

“To say (it) didn’t would 

be a lie,” Kemp said. “There’s 
moments where 
you just keep 
messing up in 
practice 
and 

you just don’t 
feel 
like 
you 

can get it.

“But 
you’ve 

got to silence 
your own voice 
and just keep 
coming out to 
practice every 
day and get a 
little bit better 
at something. You’ve got to pick 
one thing every day, and that’s 
how I got through it.”

With his struggles in the first 

year of spring practices, Kemp 
didn’t last long as a linebacker. 
Seeing 
his 
apparent 
flaws, 

Brown switched him back to 
defensive end before last season 
even began.

While he saw action in just 

two games his freshman year, 
Kemp has rediscovered his 
comfort zone at the anchor 
position on the defensive line. 
And in his second year, he has 

shown just how 
valuable that is.

Enjoying 

what 
Michigan 

defensive 
line 

coach 
Greg 

Mattison 
described 
as 
a 

‘very, very good 
spring,’ 
Kemp 

has 
shown 

signs of steady 
growth. From his 
comfort level to 

his understanding of Brown’s 
defense, Kemp has impressed 
the Wolverines so much that 
Brown joked he didn’t even 
recognize the old Kemp.

Expecting to back up Rashan 

Gary this season, Kemp has used 
his fellow rising sophomore as a 
model to improve his level of play.

“He goes in there and sets 

the tempo,” Kemp said. “For 

me backing him up, I want to be 
as close as I can that there’s no 
drop-off. Rashan — we already 
know what he can do. And when 

I come in, I try to 
mimic his game a 
lot so that when 
he’s in and I’m 
in, it almost looks 
the exact same.”

The pair will 

be relied upon to 
help 
Michigan 

replace 
its 

starting defensive 
line 
from 
last 

season — fifth-
year seniors Chris 
Wormley, 
Ryan 

Glasgow and Matthew Godin 
and senior Taco Charlton. Gary, 
part of the backup rotation for 
that quartet, will be expected 
to jump into their vacated 
spots, along with fifth-year 
senior defensive tackle Maurice 
Hurst, rising senior defensive 
end Chase Winovich and rising 
senior defensive tackle Bryan 
Mone.

Behind those four regular 

contributors, much is yet to be 
determined for the Wolverines. 
Kemp has a strong opportunity 
to emerge as a key part of that 
second rotation this season.

“I think that’s the feeling, 

especially across the board, at 
a lot of defensive positions, as 
well as offense,” Kemp said. “A 
lot of guys graduated and you 
can see it now, they’re all in 
the (NFL) Draft getting ready 
to start playing on Sundays. 
This year, spring ball has been 
a good competition of, ‘Who are 
we going to see on Saturdays?”

Back in his original position, 

Kemp is now poised to play an 
important role this season. He 
always had the potential, but 
now he has a shot to bring it to 
fruition in the right position.

“If I was able to get a 

scholarship 
here, 
there’s 

something that at one point 
(former defensive coordinator) 
Mattison saw that gave me the 
scholarship,” Kemp said. “It’s 
just, ‘Make it come true now.’ ’’
