student vote in
midterms
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
Former United States Presi-
dent Bill Clinton spoke to a capac-
ity crowd at Rackham Auditorium
yesterday, capping 4 hours of polit-
ical fanfare aimed at rallying vot-
ers to support Congressman John
Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) and other
Democratic candidates through-

out the state in next week's mid-
term elections.
Clinton told the audience that
this year's election has made him
"somewhere between disturbed
and ticked off," urging voters
to participate in the election to
continue propelling Democratic
policies and initiatives forward,
especially in the state of Michigan
which has been supportive of him
in the past.
"I love Michigan," Clinton said.
"Michigan's been good to me and
I try to be good for Michigan. And
John Dingell has been good for
you."
In order to help the ailing
economy, Clinton emphasized

the importance of balancing the
national budget and creating new
jobs, specifically in the green ener-
gy and technology sectors. He said
that Dingell's focus on these goals
has helped make Michigan an
"advanced battery manufacturing
sector," but said there is still much
work to be done.
"There's always a gap between
when you start fixing things and
people feel fixed," Clinton said.
"The challenge for our party is this
election is occurring in the gap."
Clinton said that since the
Obama administration has tried
to fix the debt left by the Bush
administration, about 70 percent
of it has been absolved. Despite

this, he said the effects have yet
to be felt by the American public
since the majority of jobs lay in the
final 30 percent - but that prog-
ress is being made to eliminate it.
"Give us two more years," Clin-
ton said. "You gave them eight years
to dig the hole, give us half the time,
four more years, to getout of it."
In response to Republicans who
claim that the Democrats have
been over-spending and trying
to implement Socialist policies,
Clinton pointed out that Demo-
cratic policy helped established a
balanced budget during his time in
office, which the Bush administra-
tion failed to achieve.

On Friday, the University com-

were killed in a car accident on
I-75 on the morning of Saturday,

Four councils joined
together to serve
around the city
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
All four Greek councils came
together for a dedicated commu-
nity service day for the first time
Saturday.
The Interfraternity Council,
Multicultural Greek Council,
National Pan-Hellenic Council
and the Panhellenic Association
combined their members and

efforts to serve the community in
25 different projects throughout
the Ann Arbor as part of the first
Greek Wide Day of Service. Mem-
bers say they hope the service
day, which featured 1,000 volun-
teers performing more than 3,000
hours of community service, will
become an annual event.
LSA senior Kathryn Rosen-
berg, president of the Panhellenic
Association, said the four coun-
cils have been working to register
volunteers for the past couple of
months.
"We wanted to have a visible
and meaningful effect on cam-
pus," Rosenberg said.

The service projects ranged
from a bottle drive, to knitting
clothes for the underprivileged, to
cleaning Nichols Arboretum.
Kinesiologysenior Ryan Knapp,
the vice president of public rela-
tions for the IFC, said the focus
of the service day was "hours not
dollars." He said if at least a frac-
tion of the participants continue
to volunteer during the year, the
event will have made a "signifi-
cant impact."
"We've done a lot of collabora-
tions, but nothing to this scale or
this magnitude," Knapp said.

California church documents report abuse .

Almost 150 people
report sexual abuse
in church documents
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Attorneys
for nearly 150 people who claim
sexual abuse by Roman Catho-
lic priests made nearly 10,000
pages of previously sealed internal
church documents public yester-
day, revealing at least one previ-
ously unknown decades-old case in
which a priest under police inves-
tigation was allowed to leave the

U.S. after the Diocese of San Diego
intervened.
After a three-year legal battle
over the Diocese of San Diego's
internal records, a retired San
Diego Superior Court judge ruled
late Friday that they could be made
public. The records are from the
personnel files of 48 priests who
were either credibly accused or
convicted of sexual abuse or were
named in a civil lawsuit.
The 144 plaintiffs settled with
the diocese in 2007 for nearly $200
million, but the agreement stipu-
lated that an independent judge

would review the priests' sealed
personnel records and determine
what could be made public.
The files show what the diocese
knew about abusive priests, start-
ing decades before any allegations
became public, and that some
church leaders shuffled priests
from parish to parish or overseas
despite credible complaints against
them.
"We encourage all Catholics, all
members of the community, to look
for these documents," attorney
Anthony DeMarco said at a news
conference. "These documents


demonstrate years and years and
decades of concerted action that
has allowed this community's chil-
dren to be victimized, and it is not
until the community looks at these
documents that this cycle is ever
going to be ended."
At least one of the priests, Gus-
tavo Benson, is still in active min-
istry in the Diocese of Ensenada in
Mexico, DeMarco said. In a 2002
interview with The Press-Enter-
prise of Riverside, Benson said he
ministered to children there but
had not done anything inappropri-
ate. It wasn't immediately known
what Benson's position at the dio-
cese is now.
Donna Daly, a spokeswoman
for the diocese, did not immedi-
ately return a call yesterday and
no one answered at the main dio-
cese number. Maria Roberts, an
attorney for the diocese, did not
immediately respond to a message
left with her office yesterday.
In at least one instance, the
files included documented abuse
by a priest whose name had not
before surfaced in any lawsuit
or criminal case, the Rev. Luis
Eugene de Francisco, who was
originally from Colombia. Police
investigated de Francisco for
allegedly abusing children, but
the diocese convinced authori-

ties to drop the case if the priest
would return immediately to his
Colombian diocese and never
return to the U.S.
"In early August 1963, Father
was placed under arrest by the civil.
police of the City of San Diego for
violation of the State Penal Code,"
then-Bishop Charles F. Buddy
wrote the Colombian bishop in
the Diocese of Cali. "At that time,
arrangements were made between
this Chancery and the civil author-
ities of San Diego in which, if
Father left the United States with
the promise never to return, the
charges against Father would be
set aside by Civil Law."
Buddy wrote that de Francisco
had crossed the border at Tijua-
na, Mexico, and was "directed to
return directly to the Diocese of
Cali."
DeMarco said the papers in the
files were the first time attorneys
became aware of de Francisco.
No one filed a lawsuit, the church
never revealed the complaints and
it's unclear what happened to the
priest or if he is still alive, he said.
Church files indicate he also
served in Florida and Texas before
arriving in the San Diego diocese,
where he worked with migrant
workers in the Coachella Valley
about 150 miles southeast of Los

Angeles.
"You have won a reputation as
a zealous worker and devoted to
the poor," Bishop Buddy wrote the
priest in a December1962 letter.
"On the other hand, the 'inci-
dents' at Indio were more serious
than first presented to me, espe-
cially inasmuch as the police have
made a record of them. You know
how word gets around, so that you
be certain that the police here will
be on your trail. ... It will be more
prudent and more secure for you to
return to your own diocese."
Another caseoutlinedinthefiles
involves the Rev. Robert Nikliborc,
who was sent to a psychiatric treat-
ment facility in the 1950s after the
diocese received complaints, then
became director of a Roman Catho-
lic residential facility for troubled
boys called Boystown of the Desert
in Banning, Calif.
Boys who lived there filed
lawsuits against Nikliborc and
were part of the 2007 settlement,
DeMarco said. The priest died
while litigation was under way.
In a 1956 letter written to Nikli-
bore while he was at a "special
retreat," Buddy referred to two
incidents involving the priest
without describing them, and said
Niklibore must decide whether to
stand with God or against him.

Tropical Storm hits Honduras

Tropical Storm
Richard expected to
head to Mexico
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
(AP) - Tropical Storm Richard
lashed Honduras' Caribbean coast
with heavy rain and wind and
was expected to strengthen into
a hurricane yesterday as it roared
toward Belize and southeastern
Mexico.
Authorities warned of deadly
floods and mudslides in Honduras
and declared states of maximum
alert in four coastal provinces.
Lisandro Rosales, head of Hon-
duras' Permanent Emergency
Commission, said civil defense
offices along the coast were pre-
paring to carry out evacuations if
needed.
Ric} ard is likely to pass near tly

Honduran island of Roatan, which
is popular with tourists and div-
ers, before approaching Belize and
southeastern Mexico late yester-
day, according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center in Miami, Flor-
ida.
Hurricane warnings were
issued for the coasts of Honduras
and Belize, and storm warnings
were in place for Mexico's south-
ern Caribbean coast.
Early yesterday, Richard was
just off Honduras' coast, at a point
about 30 miles (48 kilometers)
north of Roatan and was moving
west-northwest at about 10 mph
(17 kph).
Its maximum sustained winds
strengthened to 70 mph (110 kph)
and were expected to reach hur-
ricane strength later yesterday,
according to the hurricane center.
Honduranofficialssaid rainwas
falling on the eastern province of

Gracias a Dios, where floods have
been severe in the past.
"Richard is travelingslowly par-
allel to Honduras' Atlantic coast
and causing rains since Friday
night on the Caribbean seaboard,"
said Daniel Posas of Honduras'
National Meteorological Service.
"Bands from Richard are
already provoking strong winds in
Gracias a Dios province that will
increase over the course of the
day."
The hurricane center said Rich-
ard could cause "large, destructive
waves" and storm surges of 2 to 4
feet above normal tides in Hondu-
ras and Belize. The storm could
bring 3 to 5 inches (7 to 13 centi-
meters) of rain to northern Hon-
duras and as much as 7 inches (18
centimeters) in some spots, which
the center said "could produce
life-threatening flash floods and
mud slides.",

MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich
CMU offers a class
on the Apple iPad
A pilot course was created at
Central Michigan University to
teach students how to maximize
the use of the Apple iPad.
Professor Patricia Janes of Rec-

vices asked Mike Reuter, director
of technology operations, to teach
her parks and recreation students
tobe "dangerous" with the higher-
level technology that is desired
and expected by today's employ-

"The class I co-teach is RPL

parks and tourism," Reuter said.
"The class is designed to give our
students the tools they need to go
out and compete better in the cor-
porate world or wherever they end
up after they graduate."
The course, which is taught by
Reuter and Dan Bracken, associate
director for the Faculty Center for

DMT stands for dimethyltrypt-

MULTAN, Pakistan
Bomb kills 5 people
at Sufi shrine
A bomb planted on a motorcycle
exploded at the gate of a famous
Sufi shrine in central Pakistan dur-
ing morning prayers today, killing
at least five people, said officials.
The bombing at the Farid Sha-
kar Ganj shrine in Punjab province
was the latest in a string of attacks
targeting Sufi shrines in Pakistan.
Islamist militants often target
Sufis, whose mystical practices
clash with their hardline interpre-
tations of Islam.
IThe dead from today's attack
included at least one woman, said
Maher Aslam Hayat, a senior gov-
ernment official in Pak Pattan dis-
tcit where the shrine is located.
At least 13 others were wounded by
the explosion, he said.
The blast damaged several shops
outside the shrine, said Hayat. But

the shrine itself, which is dedicated
to a 12th century Sufi saint, was
largely unscathed, he said.
Pakistan is 95 percent Muslim,
and the majority practice Sufi-
influenced Islam.

leadership may be inching toward
a "Plan B" in which they seek
international recognition of an
fndependent state without Israeli
agreement.
Talks have stalled, just weeks
after their launch, following Isra-
el's decision to resume full-fledged
settlement building in the West
Bank after a 10-month period of
restrictions. The Palestinians
have said they cannot negotiate
with Israel unless the curbs are
renewed, and one senior Palestin-
ian official yesterday insisted on a
* total halt to construction.
As the stalemate drags on, the
Palestinians have said they are
considering sidestepping Israel
by seeking U.N. Security Council
recognition of a Palestinian state
in the West Bank, Gaza and east
* Jerusalem - territories the Jewish
state captured in the 1967 Mideast
war.

At rally, group
lobbies for rights
of animals in'U'
research labs

TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
University of Michigan-Dearborn student Cardi DeMonaco spoke to a snall audience about higher education at a Lansing rally.

In ight of funding cuts, students rally in
Lansing for increased state appropriations

By K.C. WASSMAN
For the Daily
LANSING - A group of about
30 students and government
officials rallied on the steps of
the state Capitol on Friday in an
effort to convince officials to pri-
oritize higher education when it
comes to the state's budget. The
rally comes in light of recent cuts
in state appropriations to Michi-
gan's public universities.
The rally was hosted by the
Associated Students of Michigan
State University and the Student
Association of Michigan - a stu-
dent group comprised of repre-
sentatives from each of the 15
public universities in Michigan.
Students, along with members
of the state government, spoke
at the Capitol in Lansing to raise
their concerns about the shrink-
ing amount of state financial
appropriations for higher educa-
tion. Several students held signs
asking politicians, "Where'd my
classes go?"
In the 201i fiscal year budget,
higher education appropriations
will be cut by 2.8 percent. The
University of Michigan alone will
experience a $9-million loss in
funding.
Though the 2.8-percent cut
was less than lawmakers original-
ly planned, and representatives
voted to increase financial aid
funding by 10 percent, students
at the protest said more could be

done to ease the financial burden
of tuition costs.
According to Michael Lip-
phardt, ASMSU director of Uni-
versity Budgets and Education
Policy, Michigan is ranked 49 out
of the 50 U.S. states in the amount
of funding it provides for higher
education, and the state currently
spends $183 million less on higher
education than it did in 2002.
In a speech at the event, Lip-
phardt warned politicians that
if they do not follow through on
their promises to make higher
education a priority, students
would vote them out of office.
He also urged students to
elect politicians that would fol-
low through on their promises to
reduce budget cuts to higher edu-
cation.
"Make every candidate here,
and into the future, earn your
vote," Lipphardt said. "Make
them promise to make Michigan
a leader in education investment,
and make them promise never
again to forget about the power of
the student vote."
Cardi DeMonaco Jr., presi-
dent of the Student Association
of Michigan and a fifth-year stu-
dent at the University of Michi-
gan-Dearborn, said the state of
Michigan allocates more money
for people in jail than in the
classroom. According to DeMo-
naco, the state spends about
$42,000 on each prison inmate,
but only about $5,500 on each

student.
"That sounds to me like failure
- a failure to recognize what is
truly important in this state, our
future," DeMonaco said.
State Rep. Joan Bauer (D-Lan-
sing), chair of the House Higher
Education Appropriations Com-
mittee, spoke at the event and
informed the audience that there
may be more cuts in next year's
higher education budget.
In an interview after her
speech, Bauer said there is
already a $1.5-billion hole in the
$7-billion general fund budget for
2011.
"My biggest fear is that if we do
not come up with more revenue in
the budget, that higher education
will face major cuts," Bauer said.
"I wish I had better news."
Brenda Lawrence, Democratic
candidate for Michigan lieuten-
ant governor, told the audience
that funding higher education is
tied to the overall success of the
state. Lawrence added that she
worries about students leaving
the state after they graduate from
college.
"The commitment to Michigan
is strong. The desire to stay in
Michigan is real, but if we don't
continue to invest in this econo-
my through supporting and mak-
ing sure we fund education, you
will get your wonderful education
and leave this great state," Law-
rence said, addressing the group
of students.

Animal rights
watchdog ranked
'U' as the 10th worst
primate lab in U.S.
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
For the Daily
A small group of University stu-
dents held a protest at the inter-
section of Ann and Zina Pitcher
Place Streets Friday, condemning
the University's use of primates in
medical research.
Members of the Michigan Ani-
mal Rights Society protested in
response to a report released by
national research watchdog group
Stop Animal Exploitation NOW!,
which named the University's pri-
mate lab as the 10th "worst lab" in
the country.
According to a SAEN press
release, United States Department
of Agriculture reports show the
University performed experiments
on 82 primates, none of whom
received pain relievers during the
tests. The University of Michigan
Health System website states that
researchers use primates to con-
duct artificial joint replacement,
coronary bypass surgery and
organ transplants.
However, less than 1 percent of
animals used in research are pri-
mates, according to the UMHS
website. The website states that
primates are only used "when
there is no acceptable alternative."
School of Public Policy senior
Joseph Varilone, a MARS member,
organized the protest. Varilone
said he opposes research that is
conducted on primates as well as
the internment of animals.
"I don't think it's right that
we hold animals," Varilone said.
"Imagine if you were in a cage for
all your life. You would go crazy."
The protesters gathered on the
corner and held signs that read,
"It's not the animals who need
their heads examined." The pro-
test even prompted a University
bus driver to stop her bus on Ann
Street to encourage the protest-
ers to continue their demonstra-
tion.
Varilone said MARS, a Univer-

sity-recognized student organiza-
tion, was formed in,1997 in order
to raise awareness about campus
issues concerning animal exploita-
tion.
In addition to Friday's pro-
test, MARS is currently lobbying
UMHS to stop using animals in the
training for their Survival Flight
program. In September the animal
rights group People for the Ethi-
cal Treatment of Animals filed a
formal complaint with the USDA
about the Survival Flight program,
which uses cats and pigs to train
nurses to perform some medical
procedures.
Sonya Molina, a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Social Work,
participated in Friday's protest.
"I came out to support the cause
that people need to become aware
of what's going on in their own
community, especially at the Uni-
versity of Michigan's hospital,"
Molina said.
According to Molina, Michigan
State University has banned pri-
mate testing in its research labo-
ratories. She said the University
of Michigan should follow its lead
and do the same.
Dr. Howard Rush, associate
professor and director of the Unit
for Laboratory Animal Medicine
in the Medical School, is respon-
sible for the care of animals used
in University research labs, In an
interview Rush said that UMHS's
policies are "formed by the law and
standards pertaining to the use of
animals in research."
"We do not have any citations
from the Department of Agricul-
ture on our use of primates," he
said.
Rush said primates are mainly
used to test treatments for drug
addiction or vascular disease and
involve a limited number of ani-
mals.
Rush, who attended the pro-
test, said the allegations by SAEN
Executive Director Michael Bud-
kie concerning the mistreatment
of primates are based on Budkie's
personal opinion.
"I find it hard to believe that the
Department of Agriculture, that
is responsible for inspecting our
facilities, has missed all the things
Mr. Budkie claims are occurring
here," Rush said.

Cholera outbreak threatens
1.3M survivors at Haiti camp

Disease sickens
3,000 Haitians,
leaves 250 dead
A cholera outbreak that already
has left 250 people dead and more
than 3,000 sickened is at the
doorstep of an enormous poten-
tial breeding ground: the squalid
camps in Port-au-Prince where
1.3 million earthquake survivors
live. Health authorities and aid
workers are scrambling to keep
the tragedies from merging and
the deaths from multiplying.
Five cholera patients have
been reported in Haiti's capi-
tal, heightening worries that the
disease could reach the sprawl-
ing tent slums where abysmal
hygiene, poor sanitation, and
widespread poverty could rap-
idly spread it. But government
officials said Sunday that all five
apparently got cholera outside
Port-au-Prince, and they voiced
hope that the deadly bacterial
disease could be confined to the
rural areas where the outbreak
originated last week.
"It's not difficult to prevent the
spread to Port-au-Prince. We can
prevent it," said Health Ministry
director Gabriel Timothee. He
said tightly limiting movement of
patients and careful disposal of
bodies can stave off a major medi-
cal disaster.
If efforts to keep cholera out
of the camps fail, "The worst
case would be that we have hun-
dreds of thousands of people get-
ting sick at the same time," said
Claude Surena, president of the
Haiti Medical Association. Chol-
era can cause vomiting and diar-
rhea so severe it can kill from
dehydration in hours.

Doctors Without Borders
issued a statement saying that
some Port-au-Prince residents
were suffering from watery diar-
rhea and were being treated at
facilities in the capital city. Chol-
era infection among the patients
had not been confirmed, howev-
er, and aid workers stressed that
diarrhea has not been uncommon
in Port-au-Prince since the earth-
quake.
"Medical teams have treat-
ed many people with watery
diarrhea over the last several
months," Doctors Without Bor-
ders said.
Aid workers in the impover-
ished nation say the risk is magni-
fied by the extreme poverty faced
by people displaced by the Jan. 12
earthquake, which killed as many
as 300,000 people and destroyed
much of the capital city. Haitians
living in the camps risk disease
by failing to wash their hands, or
scooping up standing water and
then proceeding to wash fruits
and vegetables.
"There are limited ways you can
wash your hands and keep your
hands washed with water in slums
like we have here," said Michel
Thieren, an official with the Pan-
American Health Organization in
Haiti. "The conditions for trans-
mission are much higher."
Aid workers are coachingthou-
sands of impoverished families
how best to avoid cholera. Vari-
ous aid groups are providing soap
and water purification tablets
and educating people in Port-au-
Prince's camps about the impor-
tance of washing their hands.
Aid groups also began train-
ing more staff about cholera
and where to direct people with
symptoms. The disease had not
been seen in Haiti for decades,

and many people don't know
about it.
Members of one grassroots
Haitian organization traveled
around Port-au-Prince's camps
booming warnings about chol-
era from speakers in the bed of a
pickup truck.
"Many people have become
sick," announced Etant Dupain,
in front of the Champs de Mars
camp by Haiti's broken national
palace. "If you have a family
member that has diarrhea, bring
them to the hospital immediately.
Have them use separate latrines."
In a promising development,
aid group Partners in Health
said hospital management was
improving in the city at the cen-
ter of the initial outbreak, St.
Marc, which is about a 60-mile
(95-kilometer) drive northwest of
Haiti. Just 300 patients were hos-
pitalized on Saturday, a number
that has decreased by the end of
each day.
A cholera treatment center
in St. Marc is expected to be
functional within the week, and
efforts were ongoing to make
clean water available in rural
communities, especially those
where rivers were the only source
of water.
Some health experts were
hopeful that they will be able to
control the outbreak of cholera in
impoverished Haiti.
"In a way, it couldn't have hap-
pened at a better moment than
now because everyone is on the
field - lots of (non-governmental
organizations), lots of money. We
haven't had any hurricanes so far
this fall but people are here, and
people are prepared," said Marc
Paquette, Haiti director for the
Canadian branch of Medecins du
Monde.

A balancing act
Detroit Public Schools must manage funds better
or years, the Detroit Public School system has dealt with
corruption in its school board, a multi-million dollar defi-
cit and a dismal graduation rate. These days, DPS is scat-
tered and inefficient. Detroit started construction of a new high
school funded by a bond program last week. At the same time,
following friction with the school board, Emergency Financial
Manager Robert Bobb announced that he won't return for anoth-
er school year with the district. The future is uncertain, but one
thing is clear: the district needs an overhaul. DPS must properly
manage its finances and balance its budget in order to tackle its
academic problems.

Failing to Consider

0

On Thursday, according to an Oct. 22
Detroit Free Press article, DPS broke
ground on its new Mumford High School
- a $50.3-million building funded by a
bond program. According to the Free Press
article, the new high school will feature
new athletic fields, an eight-lane swim-
ming pool and an auditorium that can seat
800. The day after the ground-breaking,
Bobb announced that he won't return to
Detroit for another school year, according
to an Oct. 22 article in the Free Press.
The new Mumford High School - one
of three new Detroit high schools planned
- should shape up to be a beautiful build-
ing. Students and teachers need facilities
that create an environment in which learn-
ing is possible - environments that many
schools in Detroit currently lack. Students
deserve schools in which they feel com-
fortable, safe and able to learn. Teachers,
of course, will also be attracted to districts
with nicer facilities.
But DPS must remember that it must
also keep up its facilities - old and new.
And with DPS's deficit sitting at $332 mil-
lion, it's not clear where the district will
find the funds to maintain the buildings
and staff them with custodians, admin-
istrators and office personnel. DPS must
make sure that its new facilities don't fall

into disrepair, or it will simply be giving
Detroit residents more of the same.
DPS's facilities aren't the only thing
in need of update. Detroit students often
don't have textbooks. They sometimes lack
basic necessities like toilet paper, paper
towel and light bulbs. Test scores have
been poor. And less than 40 percent of
Detroit students make it to graduation.
But before DPS can tackle these defi-
ciencies, it has to clean up its spending.
Now that Bobb has chosen to leave DPS,
the condition of the district's finances is
uncertain. Things between Bobb and the
DPS Board of Education have been tense.
Bobb may have spent more time focusing
on fixing academics than he did on balanc-
ing the districts' budget. He has argued
that the two go hand-in-hand. But Bobb
increased the deficit by $100 million in a
year. Whoever takes control of the city's
finances after Bobb should be sure to focus
on money, not academic reform.
Unless the district can manage its money
properly, it can't combat the problems stu-
dents face. To increase its test scores and
graduation rate, DPS must provide stu-
dents with a learning environment that
includes more than just eight-lane swim-
ming pools: it must give them tools to suc-
ceed academically.

A s co-founder and president of
the Michigan Political Union,
find it hard to criticize any
student organiza-
tion whose mission
statement closely
resembles our own.
Take Consider mag-
azine, for example.
According to its V
official website,
Consider magazine
is a "non-partisan,
non-profit publica- NOEL
tion operated by
students at the Uni- GORDON
versity of Michi-_
gan." Its purpose is
to "provide an open forum for discus-
sion of significant issues of campus,
community and national interest."
Like MPU, Consider has a duty to pay
close attention to the way it portrays
certain issues and the people affected
by them. But in the case of open hous-
ing (formerly known as gender-neu-
tral housing), I think that the "point
counterpoint publication" - as it
defines itself - failed to appropriately
weigh the consequences of publishing
its Oct. 6 edition.
In March, the Gender Neutral Hous-
ing Coalition conducted a survey that
found 67 percent of the student body
supports introducing what was then
called a gender-neutral housing option
at the University. But the issue I have
with Consider has nothing to do with
my stance on an open housing policy; it
has everything to do with what I think
was a lapse in judgment and foresight.
In case you haven't seen it yet, Con-
sider's Oct. 6 edition has a cartoon on
its front cover that depicts a line of
four bathroom stalls with closed doors.
Seen from beneath the door of the first
stall is a pair of boots, in the third is a
pair of high-heels and in the fourth
two pairs of sneakers. Hopefully, you
noticed that I skipped the second stall.
That's because coming out from under-
neath the second stall is what looks like
a fish or mermaid tail.
Failing to find a caption anywhere

on the page, or inside the magazine for
that matter, I came to the conclusion
that the image was meant to suggest
that there is something strange, dif-
ferent or perhaps other-worldly about
people whose gender identity does not
match their presumably biological sex.
Why else would you draw a fish tail ina
cartoon about open housing?
In an effort to gain a better under-
standing of the cartoon, I contacted
Rose Jaffe, the cartoonist responsible
for the cover. Jaffe is also a cartoonist
for The Michigan Daily. Jaffe said that
such a depiction was not her intention
at all. She claims that her cartoon was
supposed to conveythat "the bathroom
is typically a place that we think of as
being separated," explaining that open
housing would be "more inclusive and
welcoming of all types of people."
"It's not meant to imply that there
is something freakish about transgen-
dered students," Jaffe added.
She went on to say that she is an
"open person and accepts everyone."
From the 30-minute conversation
I had with Jaffe, I have no reason to
think she's lying. After all, she was
more than willing to answer all my
questions directly and candidly. But
Jaffe's carton was certainly not inter-
preted that way by many students on
campus, myself included. Take for
example Anya Nona. Even though she
wrote the counterpoint for the open
housing edition, Nona conceded dur-
ing our conversation that "after look-
ing at it, I think the illustration is a
little offensive. I can see why you're
writing an opinion piece on it."
In striving to be provocative and
thought-provoking, I think Consider
unintentionally crossed over the line
into offensive. Now of course some
people may disagree with me. Others
may think that this is a case of politi-
cal correctness gone awry. But the fact
of the matter remains that if such an
offense could have been avoided, it
should have been.
Zachary Berlin, Consider's edi-
tor in chief, said that the cover was
meant to "challenge pre-conceived

notions about sexuality. We (Consid-
er) have been around for two decades.
We want to get people talking." But in
an effort to "get people talking" and
play a polarizing hand," Berlin and
his staff inadvertently created a car-
toon that might have caused a queer
person to feel uncomfortable and
insecure about his or her gender iden-
tity and expression. Human sexuality
can be an extremely sensitive issue
for some people. As such, it should
have been treated with a bit more tact
than some of Consider's previous top-
ics, which range from pornography to
Internet privacy.
Consider should
have thought about
impact of cartoon.
Moreover, the campus publica-
tion should have done a better job of
fact-checking Nona's counterpoint.
All of the arguments in her piece
stemmed from a factually inaccurate
assumption. Nona insinuated that
an open housing policy, if adopted by
the University, would force students
who didn't express interest in the
program into an uncomfortable situ-
ation. But this simply isn't true. Uni-
versity Housing has explicitly stated
that such a policy would be opt-in
only. In response to this issue, Berlin
stressed that Nona does not represent
the views of Consider magazine and is
not a member of its staff.
Ultimately, I think Consider is a
fine publication. I genuinely believe
that it plays an important role in stir-
ring much needed discussion on our
campus. But as the Spiderman clich6
goes, with great power comes great
responsibility.

Vote for accountability

Far from foregone

For all the gnashing of teeth in the media
over Tea Party upset candidates like Delaware's
Christine O'Donnell and New York's Carl Pala-
dino, you never hear much about the establish-
ment Republicans they beat: Mike Castle and
Rick Lazio. Both were viewed by the Tea Party
movement as unacceptable candidates because
of their support for the 2008 bank bailouts by
the federal government. And when Bob Ben-
nett, the incumbent Senator from Utah, was
defeated in his party's primary, representatives
of the Tea Party then, too, asserted it was for his
support for the bailouts.
Say what you will of the Tea Party - it knows
how to clean house. Voters said that they would
rather take a boor like Carl Paladino over a bank-
ster toad like Rick Lazio.
The push against bank bailouts stands in stark
contrast to that other popular movement, the
anti-war movement against the occupations of
Iraq and Afghanistan. The left-dominated anti-
war movement dissipated into the sad slogan,
"Anybody But Bush." While the Tea Party move-
ment stuck to its guns and ignored cries that it
was nominating the unelectable, anti-war orga-
nizers took the pill: they must settle for candi-
dates who"can win."
Two years into the Democrat-controlled pres-
idency, our foreign policy has notchanged. Presi-
dent Barack Obama has reneged on promises of a
military drawdown and increased transparency,
restoration of civil liberties and an end to the
abuse of executive power - the very things he
was elected for. Why would that be?
One politician, in an unusual fit of honesty,
explained it.many years ago. Shortly after the
tragedy at Columbine High School in 1999, Col-
orado's Republican governor Bill Owens, who
has earned the endorsement of the National
Rifle Association, signed a major piece of gun
control legislation. Asked by a reporter if he
was afraid he may have alienated his voter
base, Owens quipped: "What are they going to
do, vote for the Democrat?"
This is the attitude politicians take toward
people whose votes they know they have. And
there are a lot of voters who will always vote
for their party's candidate, no matter the issues
or the candidate. Politicians call this "the base-

line vote."
So now election day is around the corner. Will
you be your party's "baseline vote"?
Whether your representative is John Dingell
or Mark Schauer, both Democrats voted for the
bloated military budget and for the $106 billion
war supplemental. Both also voted against audit-
ing the Federal Reserve and instead to give it
even more control over our economy.
Can any of their votes be considered a reversal
of Bush-era policies? Before you say the health
care bill, remember that Bush signed the Medi-
care prescription drug bill. He, too, increased
government's role in medical care.
Ultimately, politicians will never heed the
demands of the people unless they are held
accountable on election day. Our representatives
in Congress are, if you consider their votes, pro-
war. If you don'tsupportour foreignpolicy- and
I should hope you don't - you must hold them
accountable. Accountability is the last thing the
political establishment wants, which is why they
avoid the subject.
Antiwar.com's Justin Raimondo identified
three major reasons politicians aren't discussing
foreign policy this year. First, typical politicians'
cowardice assures them it's easier to say nothing.
Second, pro-war Democrats don't want to alien-
ate their anti-war base and pro-war Republicans
have no dispute. And third, examination of our
foreign policy would reveal painful facts about
our domestic policy that would re-shape the
political dialogue.
That's why it's time to bring this into the
political dialogue. It's time to face reality and
do something about it. In fact, just before the
election is precisely the right time. Election
results teach the politicians to listen - or not.
It's up to us.
For this reason, Raimondo will be speak-
ing at the Michigan League at 7 p.m. tonight to
discuss the necessity of a bi-partisan anti-war
coalition, determined to hold all politicians
accountable for pro-war votes, regardless of
party. The event is sponsored by Campaign For
Liberty and College Libertarians. Information

ighlighting, as always, a side
of the truth that serious news
coverage could never grasp,
The Onion recently
posted an alarming
news brief about
the upcoming elec-
tion on its website.
In part, it read:
"DemocratsZ
stand to lose as
many as 8,000 con-
gressional seats
and more than 917 IMRAN
gubernatorial races
in November's SYED
midterm elections
... Republicans are
poised to pick up 1,500 seats in Ohio
alone, and could wind up with a 23,576-
to-12 majority in the Senate..."
If you've watched cable news recent-
ly, then the sarcasm should hit home:
Hardly a second goes by these days
withoutyet another blabbering politico
declaring the death of the Democratic
Party. And from staggering poll deficits
even in previously safe districts, a rhe-
torical firefight that's been a lost cause
since about April and the recently-
exalted "enthusiasm gap," we can cer-
tainly say that the Democrats are in for
a tough one.
But lost in all the alarmist non-
sense about the permanent Republican
takeover of the world is the individual
candidates themselves. When Repub-
licans take the majority in one or both
houses of Congress, and in governor's
offices and state legislatures across
the country, who those individuals are
will matter. At a time when Tea Party
candidates continue to push the enve-
lope for how crazy extreme a person
can be and still get elected, we need to
understand that not all Republicans (or
Democrats) are the same.
About two years ago, I wrote a col-
umn about the particular Republican
who represents my home district,
Michigan's 11th (My McCotter mistake,
11/03/2008). Thaddeus McCotter is, by
all relevant standards, as evil a failure
as one could possibly imagine. Divisive,

self-absorbed and bitterly vengeful
toward pretty much any proposal that
comes from the Left, Thaddeus has
nonetheless been elected four times -
and he'll win again this time. The time
to defeat him was in the 2002 Republi-
can primary, but that's also when most
of us sensible people in the 11th district
couldn't be bothered to care.
Regardless of the ultimate fate of
Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Russ Feingold
(D-Wis) or Charlie Crist (I-Fla.),
what happens right here in Michigan
will matter, and those races are the
ones we can actually affect. It's true
that Republican gubernatorial can-
didate Rick Snyder will cruise into
office (even if his independent streak
has already begun to fade), but lower-
level races remain in play and voters
had better look beyond the cable news
political narrative to understand that
much remains at stake.
One especially important election
is the race for the Michigan Supreme
Court. Yes, it's silly that Michigan
elects supposedly non-partisan judges
who have been nominated by politi-
cal parties, but let's get over that. The
Michigan Supreme Court obviously
plays a pivotal role in the state of the
law in Michigan, but few people real-
ize the widespread implications the
court's rulings have.
In the world of criminal justice,
the court is currently considering
measures that could slam the door on
thousands of inmates, many of whom
are innocent. The court's rulings also
affect the state's business culture and
economic outlook, making those seven
justices key players in Michigan's road
to recovery.
There are two incumbents vying
for reelection - Alton Davis (unof-
ficially a Democratic nominee) and
Robert Young (unofficially a Republi-
can nominee) - and three challeng-
ers, Denise Langford Morris (secret
Democrat), Mary Beth Kelly (secret
Republican) and independent Robert
Roddis.
While incumbents nearly always
win reelection in judicial races, the

2008 election shook up that conven-
tional logic. Unofficial Democrat
Diane Hathaway challenged then-
sitting Chief Justice Clifford Taylor
(a Republican favorite) and soundly
defeated him. The sweeping coattails
of President Barack Obama clearly
carried over to the "non-partisan"
side of the ballot as well.
Even local races
can have big
consequenes.*
That the political atmosphere
affects "non-partisan" races is thus
undeniable. But voters must again
consider their options thoroughly. I,
for example, will vote for Davis and
Kelly, which is an unconventional
combination at first glance, but not
so when we look beyond labels and
consider the candidates personal
records, ideals and convictions.
Young and Kelly are both nominat-
ed by the Republican Party but offer a
stark contrast in terms of judicial out-
look, personality and loyalty. Davis is
nominated by the Democrats, but asa
native of Michigan's upper peninsula,
he offers plenty in terms of personal
conviction and philosophy for Repub-
licans to admire.
With much of the electorate sitting *
out the races they can't understand
(i.e. the ones with no party affilia-
tion), those few informed voters who
do vote in all races can make a huge
difference. Regardless of the eulogies
being sung on cable news for Obama,
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the
Left in general, Michigan's political *
and economic future remains very
much undecided. And it's up to the
informed few to set the course.

Community members honor two University graduate students who died in a car accident last week at a candle light vigil Friday
night. The vigil was hosted by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.
More than 1,000 gather at
candle light vigil Fr

CLINTON
From Page 1A
"I almost gag when I hear these
Republicans," Clinton said, "lam-
basting the president and the Dem-
ocrats in Congress, 'Oh they're
such big spenders, they're crazy
quasi-Socialists, they've gone hog
wild.' I have a simple question.
Who was the last president to give
you a balanced budget?"
Clinton added that in the quest
to develop a strong economy, vot-
ers should arm themselves with
knowledge just as they would going
into a football game.
"I guarantee that half this crowd
could give me a detailed discussion
on the probability of Denard Rob-
inson playing in the next football
game," he said.
"When something matters to us
like football, the facts are impor-
tant to us, and we know them,"
Clinton continued. "I propose we
conduct this election like we are
getting ready to play a football
game because this is exactly what
we're doing in the international
economy, and we better be ready
when we play."
To increase international com-
petition, Clinton said the U.S. must
continue focusing on financingjobs
and education in the small busi-
ness, green energy, technology and
infrastructure sectors. Since these
types of jobs require more special-
ized skills and knowledge than
some other jobs, Clinton said it is
crucial to continue fighting for stu-
dent aid programs to allow more
students to embark on these pro-
grams - something he said Dingell
has always fought for.
"If you care aboutputting people
to work, who can go to work tomor-
row morning, you've got to vote for
John Dingell," Clinton said.
In closing, Clinton stressed the
importance of mobilizing the youth
vote. He said expected voter pro-
files show that the number of stu-
dent voters is expected to decrease
55 percent from the 2008 presiden-
tial election.
"Young people who don't vote
are literally playing Russian rou-
lette with their own future," Clin-
ton said. "We've got to get back to
number one, and we can do it if we
re-elect John Dingell."
Dingell spoke before Clinton,
thanking audience members for
their support in his campaign
efforts. He said that while he has

had the ability to work in Washing-
ton for the past 55 years, he never
forgets the constituents he is repre-
senting in Michigan when working
to implement policy.
"I might have the pleasure and
privilege of working for you in
Washington, but I've never forgot-
ten who sends me there and who
I work for," Dingell said. "I work
for the working men and women
of Michigan, for jobs in our auto
industry, for medical care for all
Americans, for information tech-
nology and clean energy jobs in the
future."
To help working families, Din-
gell said he hopes to prevent
Republicans from giving tax cuts
to the wealthy, privatizing Social
Security and cutting Pell grants.
Dingell said that many Republi-
cans call this fight "class warfare,"
something he said he believes the
Republicans made possible.
"It's a Republican war on mid-
dle-class family," Dingell said.
"Not on my watch and not on your
watch. "
Before introducingClinton, Din-
gellsaid Democratic presidents like
Clinton and Barack Obama have
led the country with kindness and
consideration for the greater good
of the American people, something
he said the Bush administration
failed to do.
"He governed this country with
great compassion," Dingell said
of Clinton. "That's something we
lacked for the next eight years of
the administration of our 43rd
president, but that we regained
two years ago with President
Obama."
Numerous other Democratic
leaders and political candidates
spoke while the crowd waited
for Clinton and Dingell to arrive,
including an opening message from
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje and
special appearances from For-
mer Congresswoman Lynn Riv-
ers, Congressman Sandy Levin,
United Auto Workers President
Bob King, Deborah Dingell, wife of
John Dingell and a political activ-
ist, and Brendan Campbell, chair of
the University's Chapter of College
Democrats.
Rebekah Warren (D-Ann Arbor)
who is vying for a State Senate seat
spoke too, as did Jeff Irwin who
is running for a seat in the State
House of Representatives. Secre-
tary of State Candidate Jocelyn
Benson, Attorney General Candi-
date David Leyton, and Michigan

Supreme Court Justice Candidates
Alton Davis and Denise Morris also
spoke.
Like Clinton and Dingell, the
speakers emphasized the impor-
tance of the youth vote in the
midterm election in order to move
Democratic ideals forward.
Hieftje's opening statement
stressed the importance of ral-
lies and events like this across the
nation in increasing Democratic
turnout, especially among youth
voters.
"We want you to be the disciples,
the people who will go out and con-
vince others that they need to show
up at the polls and they need to vote
Democratic," Hieftje said.
Campbell also spoke about the
importance of the youth vote in
helping to shape the policies of the
state of Michigan, and in turn the
country. He said he aims to over-
turn sentiment that student partic-
ipation will decline in this election.
"I know they're wrong, you
know they're wrong," Campbell
said. "But it's up to us to show them
they're wrong in nine days."
In a passionate speech pre-
ceding the brief break before the
introduction of her husband and
Clinton, Debbie Dingell told the
crowd how her husband's cam-
paign is "not going to leave a single
stone unturned" in the quest for
Democratic support.
"We're fighting for jobs, we're
fightingforthe economy, we're fight-
ing for health care, we're fighting for
the future of America," she said.
Many students in attendance said
they felt excited about voting after
the event, including LSA sophomore
Yonah Lieberman, who is also a
member of College Democrats.
"Students are a huge percentage
of the vote, and we really need to
get out there because we're impor-
tant, we're the next generation,"
Lieberman said. "The things that
the lawmakers do now are going to
affect us tomorrow."
LSA sophomore Emee Ta said
she enjoyed the fact that Clinton
localized his speech and made it
relatable to Michigan residents
and students. As a first time voter
in this election, she said she was
glad to be there to listen and get
involved in the campaigns.
"I really liked the fact that he
related it to students and he even
mentioned Michigan football,
which is nice that he can relate to
people like that," Ta said. "It was
definitely interesting."

From Page 1A
accident is currently being investi-
gated.
The accident that killed Xu and
Xie comes in the midst of a recent
rash of fatal car accidents involving
university students. LSA freshman
Heather Comstock died in a car
accident on Oct.10 while drivingon
U.S. 23 with three other students
from Okemos and Williamston,
Mich. According to FOX 2 Detroit,
University graduate student Ash-
ley Thomas was also killed in a car
accident onthe Southfield Freeway
on Friday.
in the wake of the recent acci-
dents, Diane Brown, Department
of Public Safety spokeswoman,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
students need to stay alert, be
aware of road conditions and fol-
low all traffic laws while driving in
order to ensure their safety.
School of Music senior Siyi Fang,
CSSA vice president said she was
glad to see so many students on the
Diag paying tribute to Xu and Xie.
While the Facebook event page
said there were 32 confirmed
guests, about 300 students gath-
ered at 8 p.m. when the vigil
started. As the vigil continued, the
crowd grew to more than 1,000
individuals as people crowded
around the Block 'M' and stood in
line to receive a lit candle.
ENROLLMENT
From Page 1A
the decreases in underrepresented
minority enrollment. "I don't think
there's a silver bullet, but we have
to be more aggressive."
Coleman added, "What I can do
and will continue to do and have
our colleagues in the administra-
tion do is to make sure that we're
continuing the outreach ... I did
that work last year, I'll do more of
that work this year, my colleagues
will continue to do the work. But
there's a lot of work (to do)."
However, many - including
Coleman - have said compet-
ing against schools in other states
where affirmative action is legal
is difficult, because unlike those
other schools, the University can-
not offer special scholarships
geared specifically to minorities.
Other University officials, like
Director of Undergraduate Admis-
sions Ted Spencer, have said they
would like underrepresented
minority enrollment to increase,
but have acknowledged that no
guarantee can be made because of
the University's rigorous academic
standards and the state's ban on
affirmative action.
"There's no guarantee that we
can do anything when you can't
use race as one of your factors,"

In addition to placing candles
around the 'M,' attendees signed
cards that were pinned to bulletin
boards in the Diag. Photos of the
victims were also placed in the cen-
ter, alongside a bouquet of roses.
Even after 9 p.m. - the sched-
uled end of the event - students
and community members contin-
ued to arrive and light candles for
the victims. For many, the shock
and the tragedy of the accident
were difficult to handle.
University alum Husnah Khan,
who shared mutual friends with
Xu, attended the vigil after par-
ticipating in a Jewish religious cer-
emony. She said the transition from
one event to the other made the
vigil that much more solemn.
"I just came from the Shabbat
celebrations, so going from such a
celebratory atmosphere to this is
very shocking ... it teaches you how
mortal you are," Khan said, add-
ing that she planned to perform a
poem about the students during an
open mic night at Borders later that
night.
CSSA members were pleased
with the amount of support and
sympathy that the University com-
munity showed, according to Fang.
However, Engineering senior
Yang Xu, an acquaintance of the
victims, said he was surprised by
the lack of awareness about the
tragedy among fellow University
Spencer said in an interview with
the Daily last year. "But we're
going to do everything we can to
start early outreach programs,
identifying students in the ninth,
tenth grade."
And when consideringthe grow-
ing classes that have enrolled in the
University in recent years, keeping
the percentage of underrepresent-
ed minority students from slipping
is an even greater challenge.
Coleman has repeatedly told the
Daily she would like to see a small-
er overall population of students at
the University.
"We've been working on trying
to shrink a little bit and some years
we've been more successful than
others in holding the line," Cole-
man said last month. "I mean, I'm
thrilled that so many people want
to come to the University of Michi-
gan, but we also have to be very
cognizant of the experience stu-
dents get, and we want that to be a
good experience."
Despite those wishes, the class
size has continued to soar - pri-
marily due to uncertainty in pre-
dicting the yield.
Officials, including then-Univer-
sity Provost Teresa Sullivan - who
now serves as the president at the
University of Virginia - told the
Daily last year that the economic
downturn made it difficult to pre-
dict how many students would

students. He explained that the
accident was mostly talked about
within the Chinese community.
"I think many American stu-
dents don't know anything about it
because Chinese students use this
Chinese version of Facebook (to
communicate) and very few Amer-
ican students have access to that,"
he said.
According to a flyer that was
printed in Chinese and English,
both Xu and Xie were the only
children in their families. The fly-
ers asked community members to
donate money in an effort to help
the victims' families.
The flyer stated that "Ran had
a giving heart," and that she vol-
unteered as a teacher in less privi-
leged areas in China before she
came to the University.
Before the accident, Xie was
working on a video tribute for his
graduating class. "Now, sadly, it is
our time to say farewell to him,"
the flyer stated.
Yan Tang, a Ph.D. student in the
Institute for Social Research who
met Xu through the University's
Ballroom Dance Club, said all stu-
dents can do now is pray for the
victims.
"We were from the same prov-
ince in China, we met at Ballroom
... maybe I will be lonely when I
go to dance now," Tang said as she
began to cry.
accept offers of admission to the
University in 2009, saying it was
one reason a larger than expected
class was admitted.
Though it may be easier to more
accurately predict economic fac-
tors as the recession winds down,
University officials say they are
now concerned with how accurate-
ly they will be able to predict the
yield because the University has
switched to the Common Applica-
tion.
Coleman told the Daily over the
summer that as the switch to the
Common Application creates more
uncertainty in the admissions
office, Spencer would need to bet-
ter predict the yield.
"We need to sort of look at our
models again and figure out how
we're going to manage this again
because next year when we go to
the Common Application, every-
body predicts that we're going to
go up again (in applications)," Cole-
man said in July. "We're going to
test Ted Spencer's ability to build
this class because you know it's
going to be a bigchallenge."
No figures on the number of
applications submitted to the Uni-
versity so far this fall have been
released by the office of Under-
graduate Admissions. Typically,
specific numbers are not released
until the application deadline has
passed, which occurs in February.

SERVICE DAY
From Page lA
Multicultural Greek Council, said
he expected "some kinks" in the
planning for the service event. But
he said he thinks the councils will
know how to improve future ser-
vice collaborations after working
together for this project.
"We're forcing individuals from
different councils to get together,
meet each other and do service,"
Rao said.
Engineering senior Nick Fra-
zier, a member of Sigma Chi frater-
nity, said he thinks the Greek Wide
Day of Service is different from
other Greek philanthropic efforts
because it utilizes the strength of
the entire Greek community.
"(It) is really all about trying to
really motivate and show off the
force of the Greek life that we real-
ly have," Frazier said.
Frazier volunteered his time
cleaning up the Miller Nature Area
in Ann Arbor. He said he thinks it

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

is important to participate in ser-
vice projects in order to give back
to the Ann Arbor community.
LSA sophomore Jillian Wey-
man, a member Alpha Epsilon Phi
sorority volunteered at the Sigma
Chi fraternity's Cans for Cans
Drive, in which volunteers col-
lected recyclables and used the
refunds to buy canned goods to
donate. Weyman said being able
to do community service with her
sorority sisters added fun to the
experience.
LSA senior Lauren Hartstein,
vice president of recruitment for
Panhellenic Association, spent
time volunteering at the Ann
Arbor Salvation Army on Service
Day. She said she thought the day
was effective because it had a local
impact.
"Accessible philanthropy is per-
fect for college students," she said.
"We all have our own values and
different interpretations of sister-
hood and brotherhood, but our
community as a whole is supposed
to have a philanthropic purpose so

I think this is pretty on key of what
we want to be doing more often on
campus."
Hartstein added that she hopes
the project will become more of a
"foundation" rather than a once in
a while event.
LSA senior Madeline Klein,
vice president of programming for
the Panhellenic Association, said
she thinks it is beneficial for the
members of the Greek community
to interact with members of the
Greek councils that they are not a
part of.
She added that she hopes Greek
Wide Day of Service participants
will find projects that they are
truly passionate about and that the
efforts will extend far beyond this
one day.
"Yes, you can get involved on
this one day and make an impact,
but you may find a project that
you love and can get involved with
more in the future," she said.

COUCH
From Page 1A
cars waiting in long lines to dump
furniture.
Instead, Cozart said, he was
doing the waiting.
"We thought we'd (fill) two to
four dumpsters per day," Cozart
said. "We've done maybe four the
whole weekend."
According to Cozart, less than
one-third of the residents who
came to dump their couches were
University students, even though
the event targeted the student com-
munity.
"What (the city) needed to do
was get these couches off porches
here on campus, and I'm not seeing
that," Cozart said.
Cozart said most of the people
who came were Ann Arbor resi-
dents who wanted to get rid of
couches from their basements or
garages.
Still, several University students
did show up yesterday with couch-
es in tow.
LSA sophomores Alex Zheutlin
and Frankie Graziano said they
only got rid of their tattered, multi-
colored couch to avoid facing a
potential $1,000 fine.
"We just don't want to get fined,"
Zheutlin said. "That's a lot of
money."
Both Zheutlin and Graziano said
they oppose the porch couch ban
because it doesn't entirely address
the issue of fire safety.

"I feel like it's kind of unneces-
sary to say it's a fire hazard when,
you know, anything in your house
could be potentially a fire hazard,"
Graziano said.
Like Graziano and Zheutlin,
Rackham student Karin Teske
said she decided to ditch her couch
because of the potential $1,000 fine.
"The fine is pretty hefty," Teske
said.
Teske added that she was rela-
tively prepared to part ways with
her couch.
"I know the premise for (the
ban), so it's no surprise to me,"
Teske said.
As Teske prepared to dump her
couch, Cozart satnbehind the wheel
of a backhoe excavator - a machine
that was used to pick up couches -
trying to maneuver a leather couch
into one of four packed dumpsters.
The couch had nearly reached
the opening of a dumpster when
it suddenly slid off the shovel and
went crashing to the concrete
below.
"FAIL!" came a shout from the
porch of the Eugene V. Debs Coop-
erative House, which sits directly
across the street from the collec-
tion site.
As Cozart was quick to note, the
co-op members were sitting on an
upholstered couch.
In an interview several members
of the co-op said the house's two
porch couches are a major part of
the co-op's social scene.
"During the summer this is our
living room," said co-op member

Miles Larson, a student at Eastern
Michigan University.
Brian Merlos, a co-op mem-
ber and LSA senior, said the co-
op's social scene will "definitely
change" asa result of the ban.
All co-op members interviewed
were strongly opposed to the porch
couch ban.
"I think it's absolute bollocks,"
Larson said.
Merlos agreed with Larson, even
though he said he was inside the
State Street house on April 3 three
hours before the fatal blaze.
"It's really a shame all of this
happened," Merlos said, adding that
despite having been friends with
LeMasters and sympathizing with
LeMasters' family, he wished there
had been a more comprehensive
citywide response to the tragedy.
Another co-op member, EMU
student Austin Tracy, gazed for-
lornly as a couch was thrown into a
dumpster across the street.
"A couch has a lot of stories, and
these stories are dying," Tracy said,
adding, "Think of how many babies
were conceived on these couches."
Despite opposing the ban, the
co-op members finally decided to
move their couches off the porch
and into a room they call "the love
room."
In an interview last week, Ann
Arbor Fire Marshall Kathleen
Chamberlain said the Ann Arbor
Fire Department will start to
enforce the ordinance soon after
this past weekend's collection
event.

Never in the history of movie-
making has an ending been so
sublimely ill-placed. Was Woody
simply too lazy to come up with a
proper third act for his latest film?
Or, gasp, was he not capable of
thinking of one?
Had it come from any other
modern director, the film's spar-
kling high points would certainly
have overridden any negativity
derived from the ending. Yet from
Woody, it's a certifiable flop.
Sure, we get a few laughs, a
few fresh faces (Lucy Punch is
particularly promising as the
prostitute-turned-diamond-
swathed-trophy-wife of Hopkins,
recalling the fervor and grace of a
young, dizzy Mira Sorvino), some
faithful droplets of neuroticism
twisted into the central plot - all
that stuff we've come to expect
from every Woody Allen film
since 1977.
Yet the thing that's lacking in
"Stranger"- that's been lacking in
every film since "Sweet and Low-
down" - is the brief leak of emo-
tions, the chill of realization that's
the heart and soul of all Woody
classics: Allen's pregnant pause
in "Annie Hall" before he mourns
"Annie and I broke up;" the "What
makes life worth living?" speech

Sex and ninjas on'$O$'

By SHARON JACOBS
Assistant Art Editor
It defies reason that South Afri-
can rave-rap sensation Die Ant-
woord should
write enjoyable
music. But for
all the gross Die Antwoord
feelings that$
will creep up
on listeners Cherrytree
after hearing
the group's re-
released debut $0$ (available in
modified online form since 2009),
the albumis actually kind of catchy
and unforgettable - at least for the
insuppressible dirty newness of its
sound.
Thematically, Die Antwoord
celebrates the same cultural
wasteland as Ke$ha - albeit mul-
tilingually, with a heavy accent
and all references to glitter and
whiskey replaced by straight-up
sex talk. It's a march of vulgarity
only occasionally interrupted by a
curse-covered dis, boast or gleeful
yell of "I'm a ninja!"
The trio's lyrics - mostly deliv-
ered by frontman "Ninja" (real
name Watkin Tudor Jones) in
a casual, over-enunciated Emi-
nem style - would make any self-
respecting prescription-drugged
misogynist blush. There are the
Veiled sexual references, like
"Even though you lying down / a
can make you stand dp" in "Evil
Boy," and then there's the wide-
open raunch of "Beat Boy," with
lines about gushing privates, hos-
pital room BDSM and intersex

conditions not suitable for repeti-
tion in any publication.
When toned down a bit, the
grime parade works - blunt, brash
opener "In Your Face" stomps in
with a killer beat and a badass
monophonic chorus of "Jealousy
makes you nah-sty / In your facet"
It's a headfirst dive into Ninja's and

sometime-singer Yolandi's thick
South African speech, in which
nearly every "fuck" comes out a
"fook."
"Enter The Ninja" follows up
withworldsofvideogamereferenc-

Cage attended half a century uralists, they care about something

pure," Krugliak explained. "In a
time when we have so much tech-
nology, that really these basic ways
of working and imaging with sounds
and speakers has such impact"
The audio used for the exhibition
is from a 2007 recording of "Lecture
on the Weather," which is directed
by Kuhn.
"I don't know if it's just me, but I
get excited at the fact that I'm hear-
ing these people that otherwise you
think about being in a textbook or
something you're studying," Krug-
liak said. "You're in this room with
their voices - it's as if you've con-
jured up ghosts or something. It's
really cool."
Cage was also fascinated by the
concept of time. Visitors to the
exhibit may lose their sense of time
as they are enveloped in the closed-
off room.
"One quote I love ... spoke about
how time wasn't vertical - it was
horizontal, meaning there isn't a
really clear beginning and end, and
the past is just this big open space
where a lot has happened," Krug-
liak said. "In the recording we used
("4:33"), there were four minutes
and 33 seconds where you only
heard the sound of the audience and
no one played ... he based everything
on that little measurement of time."
Krugliak hopes that this exhibit
can serve as a forum for discussion.

"This is really rare - the trust
doesn't give permission for this to
be done very often and it's only been
shown a few places," Krugliak said.
"I would love for a group of students
to use this as a class, and talk about
politics, music and anything else."
In Krugliak's perspective, this
work can be incorporated into mod-
ern student life at the University.
"To hear Cage's voice fill a room
in 2010 is sublime. It reignites the
past," Krugliak said. "To recreate
'Lecture on the Weather' inspires
the present, and adds to it the
sounds of students bustling in the
hallways, jackhammers completing
last-minute repairs and conversa-
tions about new ideas. It speaks of
choice and possibility."
As part of the festival, there will
be University Musical Society per-
formances by some of the original
festival composers and founders:
ONCE. THEN. on Nov. 2 and ONCE.
NOW. on Nov. 4. A Nov. 3 sympo-
sium will feature distinguished fac-
ulty speaking on Ann Arbor's role

Director Laura Kuhn will deliver a
Nov. 4 Penny Stamps Distinguished
Speakers Series lecture at the Mich-
igan Theater. Also, the Institute
for the Humanities has a display of
documents, posters and compos-
ers's manuscripts from the original
festival.

ANTWOORD
From Page 7A
"Ay-yay-yay, I am your butter-
fly" at a pitch right out of "Yoshi
Story," Ninja trills a fast-paced
rap and a background of com-
puter bleeps manages to gather
it into something resembling a
song.
But "Rich Bitch" starts to turn
up the tacky. The track is Yolandi's
proclamation that her newfound
success hasn't changed the fact
that she's still an asshole ("I do my
own thing when the phone rings
... Only speak to people I wanna
speak to").
It's one big trashy whine, but
something about its obnoxiously
whirring harmony and the whis-
pers in the background holds your
attention.
"She Makes Me A Killer" also
occupies the middle ground
between crude-funny and out-

sweetness; it produces the same
overbearing queasiness that
inevitably comes after that third
Snickers bar that you totally
thought you could stomach, but
now causes you to become ill at
the sight of sweets. Case in point:

right disgusting. Stealing back the
spotlight, Ninja uses a few sexual
anecdotes to teach listeners why
they shouldn't marry a pretty
woman.
The poor guy can't understand
how his horny nature makes
things go from "hunky-fucking-
dory" to him getting beat up and
ball-broken by the ladies. Explicit
it is, but it's still hard not to laugh
when, over a frantic synth shim-
mer, he offers a girl he's with to his
DJ and lets out a panic-stricken
"I thought Barney said sharing is
caring!"
But when the nasty takes over,
$O$ loses its sense of fun. "Fish
Paste" is a four-minute insult
about somebody's mom's vagina,
and it would be ill-advised to weed
through the thick vowels and roll-
ing "r"s of "Beat Boy" to find the
song's lyrics.
Die Antwoord can make a
good beat and has a sort of trashy
appeal, but everything has its
limit. Embarrassingly explicit at

aving spent so much time
in front of the screen,
I've often assumed that
a jump to a
creative role
in film would
be a simple
thing. How-
ever, beyond
film's practi-
cal difficul-
ties - which
are daunting ANKUR
no matter the SOHONI
environment
- I've found it
tough in my time at the University
transiioning from consumer to
creator and viewer to artist.
Recently introduced to screen-
writingthrough a class here at the
University, I've been constantly
struggling to develop a good bal-
ance between viewer and writer,
suddenly stumbling across a mine-
field of my own self-delusions and
arrogance and discovering the
difficulties any filmmaker has in
developing a voice.
There is incongruence
between the two sides of a film.
Each film is created in a certain
way and with certain motiva-
tions, and then each is viewed in
a manner entirely independent of
those motivations. The separa-
tion contributes to the beauty
of the art, because a single film
can be seen an infinite number
of ways. Nonetheless, the gap is a
frustrating one to cross.
I watch film on a moment-
by-moment basis. That sounds
simple, but it's true beyond the
obvious statement that film is a
collection of images. It reckons
back to the very first films, which
were entirely non-narrative and
illustrated only a single scene,
such as the Lumiere brothers'
1896 classic "The Arrival of a
Train at La Ciotat Station." Film
is naturally momentary, not nar-
rative, but narrative film is all I've
ever known. And that's something
I didn't realize until I saw the
other side of the art.
When I watch a film, story can
take a back seat, and the macro
film's fatal flaws matter little in
the context of the micro scene's
emotional connection. In every
subsequent moment, the film has
a chance to win me over. I don't
watch anything with a cynical
urge to throw it away, and I don't
make ajudgmentuntil the closing
credits roll.
I'm an easy sell. And I'm the
type of viewer that movie studios
love. That said, much to my cha-
grin, myviewer identity doesn't
translate well into a creative one.
Films are not conceptually
created on such an elemental,
scene-by-scene basis. Screen-
writing, as the beginning for the
process, focuses on the narrative
flow and character development
of the entire film; the idea is that
viewers can subconsciously sense
narrative structure in a way that
will automatically feed their con-
scious reaction to the film. Many
interested viewers, of course, will
critique a film's narrative struc-
ture quite consciously, but such
analysis is more often done after
the actual viewing, not during it.

But what exactly have the aughts
yielded for us? Murder and three-
somes? Even the decade's best,
the nubile "Match Point" and
"Vicky Cristina Barcelona," are
missing that brief descent from
sexy fantasy-romp into reality.
In fact, the absent ending isn't
so much an anomaly as a grow-
ing constant, as distasteful to the
audience as the grating voiceover
narrations. These items mark the
tragic realization we all don't
want to admit: The world is no
longer relevant to Woody. And
what's worse: Woody is no longer

Before a writer takes on the
actual writing of a screenplay, he
or she must create a "logline" - a
one-sentence outline of the film's
plot, identifyingthe protagonist,
conflict and primary goal in
concise and simple fashion. This
was my first writing challenge
- one made insurmountable at
first because of my viewing style.
Envisioning my creations, I would
always see an image, not a story.
It was disappointing to see how
unprepared I truly was to make
the jump, but even more disap-
pointing to realize that visual
and dramatic creativity is of little
value without an established
structure in the narrative.
From the logline, every writer
moves closer toward a more
detailed plan, eventually develop-
ing scenes and going step by step
through the scriptbefore actu-
ally writing it. In the actual act
of screenwriting, there's signifi-
cantly less spontaneity than I had
ever envisioned.
I had looked forward to the cre-
ative process of writing a script,
going freestyle and making some-
thing artistically attributable to
a single burst of creative energy.
The same way that poets let their
words flow, whether they have a

saving grace: As infectious, penis-
fixated South African scenester
rap groups go, Die Antwoord is
the best.
Not since Ren and Stimpy's
"Happy Happy Joy Joy" has there
been a musical product released
with the same ecstatic message
so relentlessly stated.
By the time the final track "OK
Alright" begins with another
jaunty, cute-as-a-button piano
riff and Gardner singing "Oh no,
here we go," you can't help but
agree. It's time to go on a sugar-
free diet.

Screenwriting *

me after all.
specific structure or not, or the
way that a jazz musician will play
an improvised solo - that was the
way I envisioned screenwriting,
usingthe formal qualities of the
craft to my creative advantage
while allowingthe story to devel-
op itself almost automatically.
Screenwriting can't be
approached with the same
momentary perspective with
which I view films. Screenplays
are not films, and to impose the
experimental qualities of one on
the other would miss the point.
I love watching film because
of the visual moment - when
image, sound and editing com-
bine to carry the viewers beyond
the story and leave a lasting
imprint in their memory. There is
little a screenplay can do to truly
replicate that, because all the
necessary ingredients are added
much further down the road. The
joy I feel in watching films isn't
present in screenwriting, and
without jumpingto conclusions,
it might not be the best role for
me.
That said, I'm too dedicated to
film to let itngo, and by the time I
finish my first screenplay my voice
will be more fully formed. I'll like-
ly discover further difficulties and
roadblocks to my creativity, but
if I can bring something personal
to the process, it's my tenacity to
let the moments stand out from
within the whole.

watch the credits, because they

With each new movie around

Vaughan and Wohlberg create new offensive threat

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
For proven scorers like Louie
Caporusso, Matt Rust and Carl
Hagelin, the pressure to net pucks
this season is on.
But with the spotlight shin-
ing on the three seniors who led
the Michigan hockey team in
goals last season, two Wolverines
- junior left wing David Wohl-
berg and senior left wing Scooter
Vaughan - have quietly but quick-
ly stated their own cases as offen-
sive threats this season.
Wohlberg and Vaughan cur-
rently lead No. 4 Michigan in scor-
ing, with four lamplighters and
one assist each. Both Vaughan and
Wohlberg have had quick starts in
2010, and their recent offensive
spark has been a key boost for the
Wolverines.

"I really think that's essential
(to get off to a good start)," Wohl-
berg said. "It builds confidence."
Wohlberg has spent most of
this season playing left wing on
a line with Caporusso and junior
right wing Luke Glendening. But
after Michigan (2-0-0 CCHA,
3-1-2 overall) dropped the series
opener to No. 10 Nebraska-Omaha
on Friday, Michigan coach Red
Berenson shook up the lines, mov-
ing Wohlberg to play with Rust
and sophomore right wing Chris
Brown on the top line.
The move paid off, as Wohlberg
scored the fastest goal in recorded
Wolverine history on Saturday
against Nebraska-Omaha (2-0-0
WCHA, 5-1-0 overall). Just eight
seconds into the first period,
Wohlberg's shot found the net
after the puck deflected off a Mav-
erick defender from Rust's faceoff

win. The goal was a critical first
score and set the tone for the sec-
ond game of the series.
But even in Friday's game, in
which the Wolverines had trouble
sustaining any offensive pressure
in the Nebraska-Omaha zone,
Wohlberg managed to find the net
with five minutes remaining in the
third period.
His goal on Friday came one
minute after sophomore right
wing Kevin Lynch scored the first
Wolverine goal of the game. Wohl-
berg's score in game one cut the
Maverick lead in half, and his suc-
cess visibly carried over into the
beginning of Saturday's contest.
Berenson said Wohlberg's goal
in the second game to put Michi-
gan on the board early was "an
important goal ... no matter when
it went in." ARIEL BOND/Daily

Sparty a national title
contender? Yuck.

Michigan earns "
season's first win
against Rockets

sasatdown on my own
couch to watch college
football on Saturday
(thank you, bye week), I became
pretty captivated with watching
Michigan State's comeback effort
against Northwestern.
I had counted the Spartans out
completely
before they
made their
epic comeback,
something xI
had been doing
fairly frequent-
ly all season
long. But then a
thought struck RYAN
me and has KARTJE
festered since
then.
This Michigan State team is
good. Actually scratch that. This
Michigan State team is really good.
Sure, there's some envy there.
And being in Ann Arbor, I'm far
from actually rooting for Michigan
State. But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't take a second look and
realize that Little Brother is doing
some big things.
If Michigan State beats Iowa
next week, in what could probably
be the most important football
game for the Spartans in decades,
this team is on the fast track to
winning a Big Ten championship.
But even more than that, it's not
inconceivable that Mark Danto-
nio's crew could be in the hunt for
the national championship.
I know, I cringe when I reread
that sentence. But it's absolutely
possible. in arguably the second
strongest conference in college
football, if the Spartans win out-
which is definitely possible-they'll
be competing for the spot with
teams like TCU, Boise State and
Missouri, all three of which play in
weaker conferences.
Yes, the Spartans don't play
Ohio State this year. But it doesn't
change that name recognition in
the Big Ten says quite a bit when
all is said and done.

After losing to Minnesota in its
first dual meet of the season, the
Michigan women's swimming
and diving team captured its first
victory on Friday, beating Toledo
182.50 to 112.50.
Senior Natasha Moodie and
junior Caitlin Dauw led the way
for the Wolverines in Ann Arbor.
Moodie took first place in the
50- and 100-yard freestyles and
Dauw took first in the 100- and
200-yard butterfly. Both were
also members of the two first-
place relay teams.
"I was trying to improve my
stroke change in my hundred
freestyle," Moodie said. "Usu-
ally in my 100-free, by the second
half of the race I'm just thrashing
and trying to finish. I was really
working on trying to keep an effi-
cient stroke all the way through
the race."
There were a few other nota-
ble performances for Michigan,
including that of Lizzie Koselka,
who took second place in the
200-yard freestyle with a time of
1.50.78.
"I think (Koselka) probably had
one of her best in season swims
of her life today in the 200 free,"
assistant coach Stefanie Kerska
said. "She just came up short and
got touched out at the end in that
200 free, but her time is really
good and she is making some big
improvements this year."
As it is still early in the sea-
son, the Wolverines' training
schedule is very difficult right
now. They are in the process of
building an aerobic base, which
includes demanding practices
every day.
"I think the team did a really
good job of stepping up when
they were in head-to-head races,"
Dauw said. "People put their head
down and didn't breathe into their
finish, trying to get their hand on

the wall first. And I think we came
in with a really good attitude
about this meet. Like I said, we
had a hard week of training and
pretty much everybody stepped
up to do what they needed to do
to win."
The diving team had simi-
lar success at the meet. Junior
Amanda Lohman took first place 0
in the one-meter dive and fresh-
man Brianna Maroukis finished
in second place.
With Lohman being the only
remaining diver from last season,
Maroukis and fellow freshman
diver Erin Bridgewater added *
necessary depth to a depleted div-
ing team.
"I'm pleased with how they are
progressing," diving coach Kz Li
said through the athletic depart-
ment. "They had to learn a com-
pletely new technique, but they
are coming along nicely. Erin
Bridgewater has started to come
around.
"She dove off the three-meter
board for the first time in her
career today. Briana Maroukis
did okay. She is improving and
learning every day. Every meet
experience she gets, it will help
her."
In the three-meter diving
event, Lohman, Bridgewater and
Maroukis finished first, second,
and third, helping the Wolverines
to victory. Concluding the meet,
Michigan exhibitioned its final
relay as it was leading by so many
points.
"The next two weeks are going
to be really tough with Indiana
and Texas, and then we swim
number one and two with Flor-
ida and Stanford," Kerska said.
"Next week is going to be really
demanding.
"We're going to have to put the
work in Monday through the time
we leave, and then we're going to
have to stand up and swim two
of the best teams out there right
now."

Senior linebacker Obi Ezeh makes a tackle in the Wolverines' 34-17 loss to Michigan State last month.

As far as other teams who could
snag those spots, Auburn and Ore-
gon seem to be the two frontrun-
ners. And with just one matchup
against a ranked opponent left for
the Ducks (they play Arizona at
home in three weeks), I'll take the
safe bet and say you'll see them
fighting for the 'ship.
So that leaves Auburn with
half of an SEC conference sched-
ule remaining, one that includes
Alabama on the road for the Iron
Bowl and the SEC Championship.
The Tigers' path is significantly
more difficult than Sparty and
the Ducks. Obviously if they win
out, there's no reason they won't
remain atop the BCS.
But if you crunch the numbers,
there's a legitimate chance we
could see Michigan State with its
best chance at a national champi-
onship since Duffy Daugherty's

crew tied Notre Dame in the con-
troversial final game of the 1966
season.
The real question for Michi-
gan fans, however, shouldn't be
whether the Spartans merit a bid
at becoming national champs, it
should be whether that's a good
thing or not for us in Ann Arbor.
I found myself wonderingthis
question as the Spartans walked
off the field victorious and with
just one big question mark left on
the schedule. Should I be feeling
sick to my stomach at the thought?
With so much parity in this
year's college football season, it's
my opinion that Michigan State
is not the No. 1 or No. 2 best team
in the country. Oregon's offense
would probably dismantle Sparty's
'D' and no one can stop Auburn's
Cameron Newton. You could prob-
ably make the argument that TCU

or Boise State could take them
down head-to-head, as well.
So all biases aside, I have to root
against the Spartans for the sake
of the system working correctly,
right?
Yeah, that's what I'll do. With-
out a logical and good reason to
root for Michigan's rival, even if
they are just a stone's throw away,
there's no reason anything of the
sort should be happening, right?
Well, maybe Purdue or Min-
nesota or Penn State will pull off
a stunner and do what Michigan
failed so miserably to do this sea-
son.
But until then, Sparty is on track
for the national championship.
And I don't know about you, but
it's upsetting my stomach.

Blue shares conference
title after loss to Bucks

By STEVEN KELLNER
For the Daily
In a pair of home matches to wind
down the season, the No. 12 Michi-
gan field
hockey OHIO STATE 2
team sal- MICHIGAN 1
vaged a UC-OAVIS 0
weekend MICHIGAN 2
split.
Ohio State rolled into Ann Arbor
for a Friday afternoon contest. With
a victory over the Buckeyes, Michi-
gan would claim first place outright
in the Big Ten. However, Ohio State
would get a share of the title with a
win.
The Buckeyes came in at 11-3 and
3-1 in the Big Ten, while Michigan
was 10-5 and 4-0, meaning that the
winner would be catapulted into the
No. 1spot in conference play.
The game started with a bang as
freshman forward Rachael Mack hit
streaking senior forward Zara Say-
djari, who was denied by Buckeye
goalie Ally Tunitis.
Offensive pressure from Ohio
State early on led to two shots from
point blank range, both stopped by
freshman Wolverine keeper Haley
Jones.
The first half ended in a 0-0 draw.
The Buckeyes edged Michigan, 3-2,

in both shots on goal and penalty
corners.
Michigan came out more aggres-
sively in the second, controlling the
ball for the first 10 minutes of the
half.
However, Ohio State's constant
pressure could not be stopped. At
51:38, the Buckeyes passed around
a corner eventually landing on the
stick of junior midfielder Aisling
Coyle who put it in the back left cor-
ner of the cage.
Some sloppy passing and missed
opportunities by the Wolverines did
not help the cause and gave Ohio
State yet another opportunity. With
just over seven minutes left in the
game, the Buckeyes struck again,
widening the gap to2-0.
Michigan proceeded with a rapid
comeback attempt in the final seven
minutes, but to no avail. A penalty
stroke by senior midfielder Meredith
Way with eight seconds left provid-
ed a glimmer of hope, but the game
ended soon after in a 2-1 loss.
"There's an awful lot to learn
from not winning games," Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz said.
Michigan learned its lesson quick-
ly; following with a 2-0 win Sunday
over UC-Davis. The Wolverines
began the game with offensive pres-
sure on the Aggies. Familiar faces

for Michigan provided the offense.
Way missed on a few corner oppor-
tunities, while freshman forward
Rachael Mack was denied just out-
side the goal on multiple occasions.
"At halftime, we talked about
really posting up as forwards and
finishing. We did a better job,
because it was 0-0 at halftime, we
came through with two goals,"
junior midfielder Katie Adams said.
Four minutes into the second half,
Adams - playing in her final home
game as a Wolverine - tallied the
first goal of the contest on a rebound
from a corner.
"We had a lot of circle penetra-
tion, but ... a lot of the time our shots
are going wide or not on the goal,"
Adams said.
Michigan finished the game with
a total of 32 shots to UC-Davis's
three. The Wolverines also compiled
a substantial corner margin of 14-1,
for a 2-0 victory.
"The team has been working real-
ly hard, putting ourselves in position
to win the championship, and that
where we are," Pankratz said.
With the win on Sunday, the Wol-
verines protected Ocker Field to
the tune of a 9-2 record this season.
Michigan improves to 11-6 on the
season, and sits in a first-place tie
with Ohio State in the Big Ten at 4-1.

"Of course every year that you
have strong seniors like that it's a
transition in the team, but hope-
fully the younger kids are learn-
ing a lot from them and they will
be able to step up and continue
the tradition next year."

New-look lines spark six-goal outburst

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
DailySports Writer
Michigan coach Red Berenson
had the golden touch on Saturday
- it seemed that no matter how
he tweaked his roster, it resulted
in goals for the No. 4 Michigan
hockey team.
After a dis- NOTEBOOK
mal offensive
performance in a 4-2 loss to No.
10 Nebraska-Omaha on Friday,
Berenson gave the Wolverines
(2-0-0 CCHA, 3-1-2 overall) a
facelift before the second game of
the home series.
The veteran coach's biggest
move was swapping left wing-
ers on the first two lines - senior
forward Carl Hagelin and junior
David Wohlberg - trying to find
a spark and help Hagelin net his
first even strength goal of the sea-
son.
The top two pairings had been
left unaltered since the season
opener, but Berenson felt that it
was time for some adjustments.
"We weren't getting five-on-
five scoring from either line,"
Berenson said. "They are our
top two lines, they have to play
better, they have to play strong
every night, and we're going to be
changing them from time to time
if we don't think they're working."
He made the switch and was
NEW OFFENSE
From Page lB
"Good for Wohlberg," Berenson
said on Saturday. "Shooting the
puck, he gave us a good start, and
I thought he had another strong
game tonight."
While Wohlberg's name will be
in the record books for his quick
goal, Vaughan had a noteworthy
Saturday night as well. For the
first time in his Michigan career,
the senior scored twice in one
game.
With four goals through six
games this season, Vaughan has
doubled his previous career total
- he finished last season with
only two total goals on the year.
Vaughan spent his first two years
playing defense, but the forward-
convertcis finding his shot early this
season.
"I'm just working hard, just
trying to get pucks to the net,"
Vaughan said after Saturday's win.
"That's what you've got to do to
score. You're not going to score if
you don't shoot. Just shooting the
puck into the net, and a good break-
up pass went out from the defense
and myline-mates really helped me
out."
Vaughan scored a power play
goal for Michigan just eight min-
utes into the Wolverines road con-
test at then-No. 9 New Hampshire
last Saturday. At 6-foot, one-inch,
Vaughan has been using his size to
penetrate opposing defenses, and
it's a good sign for the Wolverines
that he is finding success going to
the net against top-ranked teams.
Hagelin scored his first non-
empty net goal of the season on
Saturday, and Rust and Caporusso
both have two goals to their names.
But on nights when they're not
finding the net as easily - or even
when they are - Vaughan and
Wohlberg have shown just how
potent and deep this Michigan
offense can be.

rewarded royally.
The new-look lines exploded
for a combined three goals and
three assists in the Wolverines'
6-1 dismantling of the Mavericks
(5-1-0).
They wasted no time in putting
goals on the scoreboard - just
eight seconds into the first frame,
Wohlberg took a pass from senior
linemate Matt Rust and lit the
lamp to grab an early lead.
Hagelin got a goal of his own
in the opening minute of the sec-
ond period, and his pairing with
senior center Louie Caporusso
and junior winger Luke Glenden-
ing accounted for another goal
later in the third frame.
"I think (my line) had a good
game - two goals scored and none
against - that's pretty good,"
Hagelin said. "Coach had to do
something from last night to wake
the team up, and it worked."
THIRD-PERIOD SPARK: Enter-
ing the weekend series against
Nebraska-Omaha, the Wolverine
offensive attack had been nearly
nonexistent late in games. Michi-
gan had mustered only one power
play goal and an empty-netter in
the third period this season, but
was still searching for the first
even-strength tally.
But against the Mavericks, the
offense finally found its stride in
the third period. The last period

on Friday was the only time in the
game when the Wolverines man-
aged to score.
In the second game of the
weekend series, Michigan entered
the third period with a 4-1 lead,
and the Wolverines seemed to
have a commanding hold on the
game. But after letting a four-goal
lead slip away against Mercyhurst
in the season opener, Berenson
wasn't going to ease up.
"Coach talked about it in the
intermission before the third.
He said, 'We know what hap-
pened against Mercyhurst. If we
don't show up in the third period
they're going to take it to us,' "
Hagelin said. "So Coach wants us
to score goals, and that's what we
did."
Added Berenson: "A 4-1 game
is still a game that can still be in
doubt. If we had to kill penalties,
and got on our heels and they get
one or two, it's a whole newgame."

When Berenson stepped out
onto the ice, his path was lined
on both sides with former Wol-
verines who had played under his
tutelage during the past 26 years
since returning to coach his alma
mater.

"It was a surprise to me,"
Berenson said of the returning
players. "I knew something was
going on - I didn't know what
- but I knew they were going to
have an acknowledgement just
before the game, but it was nice to
see all those guys back."

But true to form, Berenson
marched past the players, hastily
accepted his award and quickly
walked across the ice.
No sucker for the spotlight, he
waved his team back into its pre-
game warm-up routine and moved
behind the bench.
SPLIT
From Page lB
Just eight seconds into the game,
junior forward David Wohlberg
rifled a wrist shot from the left
end boards that caught goalie John
Faulker off guard and found its way
into the back of the net. The goal
was the fastest in program history.
Following the quick tally, a new
Michigan team seemed to surface
- one that played a tighter check-
ing game against Nebraska-Oma-
ha's prolific offensive attack.
"We didn't turn over the puck as
much as last night, so they didn't
get enough chances to win this
game," Hagelin said. "Itcomes down
to us playing well from the get-go
and winning battles."
And while you could look at the
amount of shots the Mavericks had
(36) and say they certainly had their
chances, that would be far from the
truth. Many of their shots came from
the perimeter of the offensive zone
and were easily seen by senior goal-
tender Bryan Hogan.
With Michigan holding a 4-1lead
heading into the third period, any
signs of a comeback from Nebraska-
Omaha looked hopeless as senior
forward Ben Winnett and junior
winger Luke Glendening each added
goals to seal the Mavericks'fate.
In arguably its best all-around
performance this season, a more
energetic Wolverine squad dis-
played what has been a hallmark of
Berenson-coached teams of years'
past: sound defensive hockey.
While playing with more fervor
in the defensive end, coupled with
sacrificing bodies to block shots,
getting the puck cleanly out of
the zone and backchecking with a
purpose, the team returned to the
Michigan of old.
"Now we know we can't just
play with 90 percent of our talent.
We need to show up and play 100
percent from the get-go like we did
(Saturday)," Hagelin said.

Players from Nebraska-Omaha celebrate after scoring a goal on Michigan g

moments in Durham when they
looked like a top-ranked team.
But senior goalie Shawn Hun-
wick stole that point while the
Wolverine power play got all
their goals by going three-for-
three on the power play. Besides
early in the first period, the
Wildcats dominated that game.
They ended up out-shooting
Michigan by 18 and out-chanced
them by a significant margin as
well.
Saturday, the Wolverines

still got themselves into penalty
trouble in the second period,
and still made turnovers in their
own zone. But good teams score
the goal that turns the game
into only a survival exercise.
And Glendening's goal, followed
by senior Ben Winnett's did just
that. Seven seconds after Win-
nett's goal, Nebraska-Omaha's
Brandon Richard threw a sucker
punch that ignited a brawl.
On its way back to the land of
steaks, it was the final act of an
Omaha team that had been get-
ting grilled the whole night.
"A 4-1 game is stilla game
that could be in doubt," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said.

"If we had to kill a couple of
penalties and got on our heels
and they get one or two, it's a
whole new game."
I'm not saying the Wolverines
are ready to make a national
title run. After six games,
nobody is. And looking back at
Friday night when they gave
up four goals to Omaha, they
haven't proven they are even
close.
But on Saturday night, they
showed a glimpse of the team
they were at the end of last sea-
son. For 60 minutes, they looked
like the team that scored two
goals in the third in East Lan-
sing to sweep the best-of-three

postseason series with the Spar-
tans. It looked like the team that
scored three straight goals to
bury Bemidji State in the NCAA
Tournament.
To believe Michigan is a top
team means to see them do it
consistently. And on the road.
Downing Ferris State in the
Bulldogs' own building next
Friday would be another small
step.
Fortunately for the Wolver-
ines, they don't need to look at
a clock. The season has a lot of
time left.

* Trio leads Blue to record-setting
weekend and fourth-place finish

By MATT SLOVIN
For The Daily
It was a record-setting weekend
for the Michigan men's golf team
in Greensboro, North Carolina, as
numerous impressive individual
results led to a fourth-place finish
in the Intercollegiate Bridgestone at
Forest Oaks Country Club.
Spirits were high on Saturday as
the team seemed to be firing on all
cylinders. But Sunday's final round
left much to be desired and prevent-
ed the Wolverines from competing
for the title, ultimately claimed by
North Carolina.
"Obviously, I was a little disap-
pointed with the way we finished,"
Michigan coach Andrew Sapp said.
"But we were able to compete with
some great teams. We didn't put
three solid rounds together."
Michigan tied a school record for
lowest team round, posting a formi-
dable 13-under par 275 in the second
round, which was surpassed only by
the Tar Heels' 268, best out of the
O 14-team field.
The Wolverines also finished
with three in the top-10 in the indi-
vidual standings.
Junior MattThompson had a sea-
son-best six-under 66 in the second
round to springboard himself to a

sixth-place finish in a brilliant per-
formance. Senior Lion Kim's seven-
under-65 in the first round was a
career-best.
Kim's first round combined with
two successive even-par 72's pro-
pelled him to seventh on the indi-
vidual leaderboard.
Freshman Joey Garber followed
up his near-victory at the Bank
of Tennessee Intercollegiate last
week by tying for eighth at six-
under par.
"Two great finishes to finish off
the season is a huge boost for (Gar-
ber)," Sapp said. "There was great
leadership this week from (Kim)
and (Thompson).
Michigan has traditionally par-
ticipated in the Bridgestone Inter-
collegiate as the closing event to its
fall season and the success there is
not far from the norm. In the pre-
vious two seasons, the Wolverines'
trip to the tournament led to third-
place finishes in historically strong
fields that typically include several
ranked schools.
Next up for the Wolverines is a
four-month hiatus before Big Ten
Match Play commences in Febru-
ary in Coral Springs, Florida. Sapp
certainly hopes that the moder-
ate success found during fall play,
which included a team title at the

Windon Memorial Classic in Sep-
tember, carries over into the spring.
"We start our offseason tomor-
row," Sapp said. "We will condition
five days a week to be ready for the
season come second semester."

Blue ends regular
season at Classic

Sophomore Evan King was the only Wolverine to continue to the final rounds of the ITA Midwest Regional Chanpionship in South Bend. He'll play again on Monday.
King lone bright spot after
mediocre team perfomance

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
For the Daily
Michigan men's tennis sopho-
more Evan King will take on Ohio
State's Blaz Rola today in a rivalry
that goes beyond the matchup
between the Wolverines and Buck-
eyes. Just two weeks ago, Rola
came back from match point to
beat King.
King has put together a string of
strong performances in the USTA/
ITA Midwest Regional Champion-
ships in South Bend, Indiana. On
Sunday, he defeated Ohio States
Balazs Novak to advance to the
semifinals, where he'll compete
with Rola for a spot in the finals.
He won all four of his singles
matches and will play Rola for a
spot in the finals.
King began his play on Friday,
defeating Cleveland State's Yan-
nick Goossens, 6-0, 6-1. He then
beat DePaul's Ben Hartman, 6-1,
6-2, and Notre Dame's No.69 Dan-
iel Stahl, 1-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3, on Satur-
day.
"I played well, fought pretty
hard," King said. "The Notre
Dame match was a little bit of a
scare. I didn't play my best tennis
in the first set. In the second-set
tiebreaker, both of us were pretty
tired. It went back and forth and
I was really pumped up when I

pulled that out. That gave me all
the momentum."
On Sunday, he continued his
success, coming away with a
quarterfinal victory over No. 104
Novak, 6-2, 6-2.
Aside from King, the Wolver-
ines left South Bend disappointed.
The No. 12 duo of King and senior
Jason Jung - Michigan's top dou-
bles team and one of the favorites
to win their draw - were upset by
Notre Dame's Spencer Talmadge
and Niall Fitzgerald in the third
round.
"I thought Evan and Jason, had
they played their best, were capa-
ble of winning the tournament,"
Michigan coach Bruce Berque
said. "But I knew that they would
have to play awfully well because
the competition was strong."
No. 25 Jung disappointed in
singles play, despite being a con-
tender to win the draw. The Wol-
verines' captain first beat Ohio
State's Peter Kobelt, 7-6 (3), 4-6,
6-4, on Friday. He then advanced
to the third round Saturday morn-
ing, before being knocked off by
Ohio State's No. 91 Devin McCar-
thy, 6-4, 6-2.
"In the match he lost, he got off
to a lead in the first set and got a
little sloppy," Berque said. "I don't
think (McCarthy) played very
well, but I don't think Jason's been

at the top of his game. But he's
experienced, he's a senior, and we
know he'll pick it up."
No other Wolverine advanced
past the second round in eitherthe
doubles or singles draw. But the
freshmen were a bright spot, play-
ing in the biggest matches of their
college careers.
Barrett Franks made a name for
himself this weekend, as he began
his singles play on Friday by upset-
ting Notre Dame's No. 112 Blas
Moros, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, before falling
in the second round.
"Barrett's been working really
hard," Berque said. "As a fresh-
man, you don't really know what
to expect and it's not uncommon
to put a little bit of pressure on
themselves. He got off to a slow
start against (Moros), but once he
felt his way through the match, he
played very, very well."
Franks, along with freshman
Justin Rossi, teamed up for an
impressive weekend in the doubles
draw. After a convincing 8-1 win
over Northern Illinois, the young
Michigan tandem nearly upset
Illinois's No. 21 duo. Rossi lost in
his openinground singles match to
Wisconsin's No. 19 Marek Michal-
icka.
"Even though (Rossi and
Franks) lost in a tiebreaker, they
played it really well," Berque said.

"That Illinois team is very good
and much more experienced, and
that was pretty impressive the
level our guys played at."
Freshman Shaun Bernstein
won his first-round match before
losing to Notre Dame's Stephen
Havens. Sophomore Chris Cha lost
his match to Illinois State's Timon
Reichelt. The two did team up in
doubles before falling to Notre
Dame.
Freshman Alex Buzzi also
played well, winning his three
qualifying matches, including a
victory over Michigan State's John
Stratton, before being knocked
off by Ohio State's No. 101 Suhei
Uzawa.
King is the lone Michigan play-
er standing in the regional cham-
pionship. Rola, a freshman, beat
King on Oct. Sin a match King felt
he should have won. After winning
the first set, King had three match
points, but couldn't put away the
Buckeye, who won the next set
convincingly. King is eager to
amend this loss, with a chance to
advance to the tournament's final,
which is also Monday.
"There's nothing better than
beating Ohio State," King said.
"They're the most hated school in
the Big Ten, especially at Michi-
gan. To take two of them outin the
same tournament would be great."

Michigan splits pair of thrillers

In the final event of the regular
season, the Michigan men's cross
country team sent six runners to
Eastern Michigan for the EMU
Fall Classic on Saturday.
The Wolverines, led by junior
Nick Thomas, held three of the
top 10 slots.
Thomas finished first for
Michigan in the 10,000-meter
(non-scoring) event, covering the
Dexter, Michigan course in 29:57.
The fifth-place finish also
earned Thomas the final spot on
the nine-man team, which will
represent the Wolverines at the
Big Ten Championships next
week.
Freshman Nick Kern took
eighth place with a time of 30:40,
followed by redshirt sophomore
Geoff Burns who finished in loth
place (30:52).
Michigan heads to Madison
next Sunday to kick off postseason
competition at the Big Ten Cham-
pionships'8,000-meter race.

MOODY EARNS FIRST

ishing the 5,000-meter event first
overall with a time of 18:14.33 and
trimming 41 seconds off of her
previous 5000-meter time.
The Wolverines closed out their
regular season by taking all of the
top-three finishes. Behind Moody,
redshirt freshman Mackenzie
Adams finished in second place
with a time of 18:16.75. This was

It was the best of times and the
worst of times this weekend for the
Michigan
women's MICHIGAN 1
soccer MINNESOTA 0
team.
The MICHIGAN 0
Wolver- WISCONSIN 1
ines upset
No. 23 Minnesota 1-0 in double-
overtime on Friday night before
losing at Wisconsin 1-0 in another
double-overtime contest on Sunday
to close a three-game road trip.
On Friday, freshman forward
Nkem Ezurike scored the game-
winner against Minnesota with
just 27 seconds left in double over-
time. Wisconsin's game-winner
Sunday came with only two min-
utes remaining.
Minnesota was the highest-
ranked team the Wolverines (3-2-2
Big Ten,86-3-4 overall) have played
all season, and Friday's match was
arguably the team's best perfor-

mance of the season and certainly
its most dramatic win of the year.
Conversely, the loss to Wiscon-
sin (6-1-2, 9-4-4), Michigan's first
in overtime all year, was its most
heartbreaking defeat.
"What I ultimately take from
this weekend is that we can com-
pete with any team in the Big Ten
and even the country," Michigan
coach Greg Ryan said. "The fact
that we're relying on underclass-
men to score all of our goals and we
can still play even with teams like
Minnesota and Wisconsin shows
how good this program is becom-
ing."
The Golden Gophers (2-4-1,
10-5-2) peppered Michigan's goal
on Friday, outshooting the Wol-
verines 21-9, but sophomore goal-
keeper Haley Kopmeyer stood on
her head to deliver the shutout. She
made seven saves in one of the best
performances of her career.
"Haley had a fabulous per-
formance," Ryan said. "But also,
most of Minnesota's shots came
from outside the box and had lit-

tle chance to go in, so I think the
amount of shots they had is mis-
leading."
Senior defender Jackie Carron
also made a terrific save onthe goal
line in the 72nd minute to deny
Minnesota agoal off a corner kick.
Despite the lopsided shot total,
Michigan clearly had the better of
play throughout the second half and
overtime periods. They created sev-
eral great chances, but couldn't put
one away until Ezurike's winner.
In the 109th minute, Ezurike
played the ball through to sopho-
more midfielder Eunnie Kim, who
fired a shot that missed the frame
by inches. Kim then intercepted
the ensuing goal kick and passed
to freshman midfielder Megan
Toohey, who laid it off for Ezurike.
Ezurike took one touch before blast-
ing the ball into the top left corner
from 16 yards out to win the match.
It was Michigan's firstroad victo-
ry against a rankedteam since2003.
"It's certainly one of the most
dramatic and exciting wins we've
had in my three years here," Ryan

said.
Saturday's match against Wis-
consin was a tense, physical affair
without many scoring chances for
either team. The Badgers had 12
shots to Michigan's eight, and there
were a total of 36 fouls from both
sides.
Kopmeyer played well again,
but gave up a rebound that created
Wisconsin's winning goal in the
108th minute to spoil her otherwise
perfect weekend and end the Wol-
verines' five-game unbeaten streak.
"It's a shame," Coach Ryan said.
"We played well overall, but we
made just one defensive lapse and it
cost us the biggame."
Michigan plays three more Big
Ten matches before the NCAA
Tournament begins on November
12.
"All we're thinking about at this
point is making the tournament,"
Ryan said. "If you had asked me
before theseasonIwould havesaid
we'd havereallysmalloddsofdoing
so, but I'd say we have a pretty good
chance now."
