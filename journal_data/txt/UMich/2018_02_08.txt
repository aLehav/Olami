CITY

Following Monday night’s 

City Council meeting, city 
staff and community members 
are 
largely 
satisfied 
with 

the 
council’s 
commitment 

to thorough representation 
and the decision to limit 
city and police influence on 
structuring the new police 
review board. However, the 
public 
remains 
concerned 

about 
how 
community 

members will be appointed 
to the task force and the 
possibility that the task force 
won’t 
grant 
investigative 

powers to the review board.

Ann Arbor City residents 

formed 
Transforming 

Justice Washtenaw, a local 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

ensuring transparency during 
the creation of the review 
board, after the city first 
initiated its review of the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
process. TJW member Julie 
Quiroz 
highlighted 
the 

group’s main accomplishment 
at 
Monday’s 
meeting 
— 

creating a primarily citizen-
based review process and 
limiting the city staff and 
police to serve solely as 
advisers to the task force, 
which she said was a really 
“important victory.”

The task force will have 

11 voting members, all of 
whom will be Ann Arbor 
residents. Though city staff 
and police will not have 
voting rights on the task 
force, 
City 
Administrator 

Howard Lazarus emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
their 

guidance to ensure lawful 
and 
appropriate 
practices, 

justifying the appointment of 
two councilmembers as non-
voting members of the task 
force.

HRC 
will 
propose 
the 

recommended list of members 
for the task force to the City 
Council on March 19. The 
target date to vote on the task

Annual three-day conference aimed to educate students and staff on safety, pleasure

As part of the 10th annual 

Sexpertise 
conference 

sponsored by the University 
of Michigan Health Service, 
Brendon Holloway, Spectrum 
Center education and training 
graduate coordinator, discussed 
the sexual health experiences 
of 
transgender 
people 
at 

the 
Michigan 
League 
on 

Wednesday.

Sexpertise 
is 
an 
annual 

three-day conference, which 
began on Tuesday and will run 
until Thursday night, aiming 
to educate students, faculty 
and practitioners about sexual 
health and experiences. Nine 
topics, ranging from sexual 
health to safety and pleasure 
in 
sexual 
activities, 
were 

presented 
throughout 
the 

conference.

Holloway began by presenting 

basic 
terminology 
used 
in 

the 
transgender 
community. 

He described his idea of a 
“trans-umbrella” 
regarding 

the different identities those 
in the transgender community 
hold. He also explained how 
the transition process varies in 
terms of experiences.

“This looks very different 

person to person,” Holloway 
said. 
“Every 
transition 
is 

definitely different.”

Holloway then went on to 

present the anatomy changes 
associated 
with 
hormone 

replacement therapy. He noted 
that when taking testosterone, 
some of the physical changes 
which occur include a deepened 

voice, fat redistribution and 
change of odor. Those who take 
estrogen tend to experience 
breast growth, fat redistribution 
and facial feminization.

Holloway 
also 
discssed 

sexual intercourse for those 
that identify as transgender, 
and emphasized that, like the 
transition 
process, 
sexual 

experiences vary from person to 
person.

“There is no right way to have 

sex regardless of your identity,” 
Holloway said. “This is totally

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
LSA 
Student 

Government met Wednesday 
evening to address the body’s 
election of the winter 2018 
election director and four 
new 
resolutions, 
such 
as 

supporting 
the 
Lecturers’ 

Employee 
Organization 

and advocating for gender 
inclusive language in bylaws.

The meeting began with 

announcements from LSA SG 
President Nicholas Fadanelli 
addressing 
their 
initiative 

with the University to start 
classes before Labor Day and 
not hold classes on Election 
Day. Fadanelli reported that he 
has received positive feedback 
from administrators and is 
meeting with the registrar 
in 
March. 
Additionally, 

Fadanelli will soon be meeting 
with the provost to discuss 
the University’s consideration 
of discontinuing “Michigan 
time,” and having classes end 
ten minutes early, rather than 
start ten minutes late.

Academic Relations Officer 

Hanna Simmons announced 
that she and several other 
LSA SG members recently 
met 
with 
administration 

members of the Residential 
College to discuss scheduling 
conflicts with their language 
requirement. Because the RC 
is seeking more information 
on 
the 
issue, 
LSA 
SG 

announced their plan to send 

a survey to students to gather 
more information.

Andrew Mitchel, an LSA 

senior, was acknowledged as 
a highly informed constituent 
and elected as LSA SG’s 
winter 2018 election director. 
 

Mitchel voiced his concerns 
about the lack of information 
many 
LSA 
students 
have 

when 
going 
to 
vote 
for 

their 
representatives 
and 

announced his plans to make 
candidate 
platforms 
more 

available either through social 
media 
or 
an 
independent 

website.

LSA SG members discussed 

a 
resolution 
to 
support 

the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization, 
focusing 
on 

LEO’s concerns that many 
University 
lecturers 
are 

grossly underpaid and have 

a high turnover rate of 40 
percent. This turnover rate 
was said to be in part because 
of the low salaries, and also 
in part that the lecturers are 
given such short notice on 
whether they will be needed 
the 
following 
semester. 

Fadanelli 
underscored 
the 

importance 
of 
this 
issue, 

highlighting 
how

This week, the University of 

Michigan’s Office of National 
Scholarships and Fellowships 
announced Public Policy senior 
Gabriel Lerner and LSA alum 
Megan Cansfield as scholars 
of Yenching Academy’s 2018 
fellowship 
program, 
which 

sponsors 
students 
through 

a two-year master’s degree 
of China Studies at Peking 
University in Beijing, China.

The program brings together 

150 students from around the 
world. Students spend the first 
year of the program studying 
and participating in fieldwork 
focused on Chinese history, 
culture 
and 
development. 

Students spend the second 
year working outside of the 
classroom while they develop 
their theses.

Yenching 
Academy 
offers 

six research areas on which 
students 
can 
focus. 
Public 

Policy senior Gabriel Lerner, 
who will enroll in the Academy 
in August, will be concentrating 
on economics and management. 
Lerner said he looks forward

On 
Wednesday, 
Gov. 

Rick 
Snyder 
proposed 
his 
 

final 
2019 
and 
2020 
budget 

recommendation 
to 
Michigan 

Senate 
and 
House 
of 

Representatives 
appropriations 

committees. The budget places 
a specific emphasis on changes 
in funding for schools, roads and 
infrastructure.

With a total budget of $56.8 

billion, a 0.6 percent increase 
from the year before, K-12 schools 
would see an increase from $120 
to $240 in foundation allowances 
per student. This increase is twice 
as large as the budget approved by 
lawmakers last year.

“What we need to continue 

to work on is seeing better 
outcomes with students in terms of 
achievement levels,” Snyder said in 
reference to standardized testing 
scores in a press release.

While state Rep. Fred Durhal 

III, 
D-Detroit, 
found 
the 

increase in K-12 funding to be 
“amazing,” House Appropriations 
Chairwoman 
Laura 
Cox,

to 
understanding 
income 

inequality from a Chinese 
perspective.

“Income 
inequality 
is 

something that through my 
Michigan 
education 
really 

stood out to me,” Lerner 
said. “China is also facing 
incredible income inequality, 
which can lead to political 
instability and social unrest. 
So my hope is to go to China, 
study inequality there and see 
if there are lessons that can be 
learned from China about how 
to tackle income inequality 
back in the United States after 
the program.”

For Lerner, the move to 

China is daunting, but he is 
enthusiastic for the challenge 
of living in a new country and 
learning a new language.

“(I am) mostly incredibly 

excited,” Lerner said. “I am 
nervous because I haven’t 
been 
exposed 
to 
Chinese 

culture or Chinese language, 
but I couldn’t be more excited 
to be spending the next year 
or so around people who are 
passionate 
about 
learning 

more 
about 
how 
China’s, 

economy, 
government 
and 

culture function,” Lerner said.

Both Lerner and Henry 

Dyson, the director of the 
Office of National Scholarships 
and 
Fellowships, 
discussed 

the 
global 
implications 
of 

Yenching 
Academy 
and 

the 
Schwarzman 
scholars 

program. 
The 
Schwarzman 

scholars, similar to Yenching 
Academy, provides students 
with 
a 
master’s 
degree 

program in Global Affairs 
at 
Tsinghua 
University 
in 

Beijing. They also both likened 
the programs to the Rhodes 
Scholars program as it allows 
students to build international 
relationships.

Dyson stated the University 

has had six scholars receive 
the 
Yenching 
Academy 

scholarship over the last four 
years. He compared Peking 
University to the Ivy League 
schools 
in 
America 
and 

discussed the opportunities 
available with a degree from 
such a prestigious school.

“While 
Peking 
is 

building an international 
cohort, the real benefit 
of it is having a Peking 
University 
degree 
and 

the 
doors 
that 
opens, 

especially if you want to 
work in China or work for 
Chinese 
firms,” 
Dyson 

said.

Cansfield triple majored 

in International Studies, 
Political 
Science 
and 

Asian Studies during her 
undergraduate 
study 
at 

the 
University. 
She 
is 

currently living in Beijing 
on a Fulbright fellowship. 
Dyson said Cansfield hopes 
to work on international 
diplomacy with a focus 
on China in either the 
State Department or at a 
Chinese think tank.

“I 
am 
very 
grateful 

for 
the 
incredible 

opportunities 
the 

Yenching 
Academy 
will 

offer 
to 
broaden 
my 

understanding of China 
and its evolving global 
identity,” Cansfield wrote 
in 
an 
email 
interview. 

“I look forward to delving 
deeper 
into 
specialized 

study 
of 
China’s 
foreign 

policy through the program’s 
unique learning environment 
combining 
Chinese 
and 

international 
perspectives 

from classmates of diverse 
backgrounds and nationalities. 
Ultimately, I hope to build on 
my experience at Yenching 
by 
continuing 
to 
engage 

with 
China 
and 
promote 

international 
cooperation 

through a diplomatic career as 
a U.S. Foreign Service Officer.”

Dyson 
also 
discussed 

his 
pride 
and 
excitement 

for 
the 
both 
Lerner 
and 

Cansfield 
in 
regard 
to 

their 
accomplishments 
and 

their future endeavors. He 
described Cansfield as a China 
expert 
and 
elaborated 
on 

Gabriel’s ability to maximize 
his opportunities given to him. 

“I think they are really 

interesting candidates,” Dyson 
said. “On the one hand how 
focused and prepared Megan 
is, and on the other hand how 
diverse and expansive Gabriel 
is in the different types of 
opportunities 
he’s 
pursued 

while, 
of 
course, 
being 

excellent at each of them.”

While 
elated 
at 
the 

accomplishments 
of 
the 

University’s 
Yenching 

Academy 
scholars, 
he 
is 

frustrated the University still 
has not had a Schwarzman 
scholar.

“It drives me crazy that 

we haven’t broken through 
with 
Schwarzman 
scholars 

… ” Dyson said. “So I am 
really excited to maintain the 
fantastic relationship we have 
with Yenching while making 
the push to the next level to 
recruit some of our very best 
students to take advantage 
of the Schwarzman scholars 
opportunity.”

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

Where is your favorite 
place to study on campus?

“My favorite study 
spot is probably 
my apartment, in 
my room, because 
it’s the most 
isolated and I have 
Christmas lights 
there, so it’s a little 
festive.”

School of Education junior 
Nicholas Maternowski 


structure of the commission — 
is planned for Sept. 4.

“As this task force considers 

the roles, responsibilities and 
authorities of the commission, 
the staff will be there for 
finance, policing, legal — all 
there to provide some guidance 
and structure to the discussion 
to make sure that what the task 
force recommends are legal and 
sustainable and emulate best 
practices,” Lazarus said.

Based on the amendments 

made to the resolution Monday, 
councilmembers 
said 
they 

were committed to recruiting 
representative residents of the 
Ann Arbor community. TJW 
hopes these task force members 
will draw from a variety of 
minority groups most impacted 
by 
unchecked 
policing 
and 

ideally include social work and 
mental health professionals.

“(City Council) did make a 

commitment to representation, 
so we want to hold them to that 
commitment,” Quiroz said in 
an interview. “We’re also really 
glad to see the amendment that 
really made a commitment to 
representation of communities 
most 
impacted 
by 
policing 

and most understanding of 
what’s needed –– that includes 
residents 
themselves, 
Black, 

Latino, Trans and that includes 
people who are practitioners 
of restorative justice, social 
workers and others who can 
bring a deep understanding of 
issues to the task force.”

However, 
Human 
Rights 

Commission member Dwight 
Wilson 
raised 
concerns 

about convincing members of 
minority groups to join the 
task force. Based on his past 
interviews 
with 
minority 

residents for other positions, 
some citizens are apprehensive 
about being in the public eye 
and risking their careers and 
livelihoods.

“I’ve interviewed hundreds 

of people and consistently those 
of color, especially Black men, 
they have said to me that they 
don’t want to be out front and 
they don’t want to be targeted,” 

Wilson said. “There’s such a 
lack of trust that they don’t 
even want their name on a list 
and it’s sad.”

Though the HRC primarily 

deals with concerns of social 
justice and diversity in the 
community, 
the 
amendment 

to give the commission the 
power to elect or confirm 
task force members was not 
passed. 
Instead, 
HRC 
will 

review the pool of applicants 
and recommend 11 selected 
residents to the City Council. 
Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton, 

D-Ward 
4, 
said 
he 
was 

unsatisfied with this decision, 
since it could jeopardize the 
representative nature of the 
task force.

“I’m a little disappointed 

because I think the attempt 
to include the HRC in a more 
powerful position was meant 
to ensure that our desire for 
a broad cross section of the 
community was accomplished,” 
Eaton 
said. 
“While 
I’m 

disappointed, I believe we are 
still going to end up with a 
fairly good task force because 
elected officials know they 
are answering to this broad 
community.”

Once 
HRC 
brings 
the 

recommendations 
to 
the 

council, 
Mayor 
Christopher 

Taylor will appoint who will 
sit on the task force. Wilson 
raised concerns about placing 
this deciding power in the 
hands of the mayor and limiting 
the power of the HRC, whose 
members are also selected by 
the mayor.

“The makeup (of the HRC) 

would be much different if the 
mayor did not hold that power 
in the city charter, and there’s 
no doubt that who he approves 
is not who I’d approve,” Wilson 
said. “I’m going to give him the 
benefit of the doubt because 
I’ve met with him on several 
occasions and it seems to me 
that he wants to do the right 
thing.”

The task force’s primary 

responsibility 
will 
be 
to 

write a charter outlining the 
structure and guidelines for 
the final commission. Eaton 
emphasized the need for proper 
demographic 
data-collection 

abilities 
to 
make 
informed 

decisions once the resulting 
board is formed.

“I hope that the commission 

will also look at policies and 
practices and training. I am 
very hopeful that they will 
look at demographics,” Eaton 
said. “Who is it that’s getting 
pulled over in traffic stops? 
There’s a lot discretion that an 
officer exercises when they’re 
enforcing the law and we want 
to make sure it’s not focusing on 
people for gender or race.”

Quiroz 
highlighted 
the 

commission’s role in enforcing 
preventative measures, such as 
ensuring proper police training.

“We need to understand does 

Ann Arbor have a commitment 
to de-escalation training and 
what does that look like?” 
Quiroz said. “Police officers 
can be trained to come into 
a situation and either throw 
someone to the ground or 
they can be trained in ways 
to deescalate and diffuse the 
situation. And we don’t really 
know what that training looks 
like… Whether you think a 
police officer is a good person or 
a bad person isn’t the issue. It’s 
about having a system of checks 
and balances that is preventive 
and builds community strength 
not starting with police.”

Some 
say, 
however, 
the 

realm 
of 
what 
police 
can 

legally do still leaves room for 
misconduct. 
Councilmember 

Chuck Warpehoski, D-Ward 5, 
emphasized the need to broaden 
the scope of these policies and 
training measures through a 
restorative justice approach.

“The broader question of 

was there harm, how can that 
be repaired, are there policies 
or training changes we need to 
make to prevent similar harm in 
the future?” Warpehoski asked. 
“Those are the kind of questions 
that open up a more expansive 
approach to reviewing police 
activities and more along the 
lines that a restorative justice 
approach would take toward 
these interactions.”

Though 
city 
staff 
and 

community members agreed 
on the general policy and 
training review functions of 
the commission, both groups 

were split on what level of 
investigative power should be 
granted to the commission. 
At 
Monday’s 
City 
Council 

meeting, the council did not 
pass the amendment allowing 
for the commission to access 
confidential 
information 
for 

their 
police 
investigations. 

Originally, only public data 
was 
to 
be 
made 
available 

for 
investigative 
purposes; 

however, city and community 
members 
proposed 
the 

commission needed all relevant 
information to make informed 
reviews of complaints against 
police. 

The task force will now 

take 
on 
the 
discussion 
of 

investigative 
power 
and 

propose their recommendations 
to the City Council in their 
charter.

Eaton 
said 
he 
was 

disappointed with this decision, 
and felt it will take a toll on how 
the task force tackles the issue 
and responds to the council.

“If you count the votes on 

council, which is the group 
that will eventually approve 
or disapprove of what this 
task force recommends, you 
can see there is division on 
that particular issue and that’s 
unfortunate because this task 
force is going to know that 
we disagree with how much 
authority a commission should 
have in investigating police 
complaints,” Eaton said. “It 
was a compromise and there’s 
still a lot of potential there but 
we sent a bad message to the 
task force that there isn’t broad 
support for real independence.”

Wilson 
highlighted 
the 

consequences of a commission 
lacking 
investigative 
power, 

such 
as 
being 
under 
the 

control of internal affairs and 
subsequently, the police.

“It 
saddens 
me 
because 

if the community cannot do 
investigation, then that means 
we will be at the mercy of 
internal affairs,” Wilson said. 
“Among the hundreds of people 
that I interviewed were police 
detectives and policemen on the 
street and each one of them told 
me you cannot trust internal 
affairs because internal affairs 
is being paid by the police and 

therefore 
is 
not 
effectively 

objective, so we need some type 
of objectivity.”

According to Warpehoski, 

the council aims to provide 
the 
commission 
with 
the 

utmost level of information 
possible without jeopardizing 
confidentiality and violating 
privacy laws.

“Whatever extent we can 

find a way to provide them 
with a high level of access 
to information, I think we 
should,” he said. “We don’t 
want to violate state or federal 
laws that prevent disclosure 
of information about minors 
or other people protected. We 
want to make sure that people 
who raise concerns, we can 
protect their privacy.”

With 
issues 
surrounding 

confidentiality, Eaton is sure 
the commission can be trusted 
with classified information, just 
like city staff is. Without this 
information, Eaton emphasized 
the commission will not be able 
to grasp the full situation and 
make an informed decision.

“We 
trust 
our 
staff 
to 

maintain confidences, and we 
trust our council members to 
maintain confidences, and to 
believe that we cannot trust 
a 
commission 
member 
to 

maintain confidences is kind 
of insulting to our residents,” 
Eaton said.

Wilson suggested at least 

one member of the commission 
should have access to any 
necessary 
confidential 

information.

“It may be what we need is a 

single person who is the director 
that at least will have access to 
everything, and she or he will 
need to have confidentiality 
— 
somebody 
needs 
to 
see 

everything,” Wilson said. “If 
not, then there’s no trust.”

Despite 
disagreements, 

Lazarus 
underscored 
the 

council’s overall support of 
moving the process forward 
to create a task force and 
subsequent commission.

“I think the fact that they 

took time to go word for word 
through the resolution and 
amendment 
shows 
they’re 

committed to this,” Lazarus 
said. “They didn’t agree on 

everything, but in the end 
they voted unanimously as a 
show of support and I think 
the 
resolution 
provides 
a 

good structure for us to move 
forward.”

City staff and community 

members 
are 
continuing 

to work together to find a 
balance between each party’s 
requests for the task force and 
commission.

“We 
got 
to 
this 
point 

because of the good work of 
the community in insisting on 
a good process and I trust that 
we will get to that end product 
with that same influence from 
activists in the community,” 
Eaton said.

Though 
the 
commission 

serves to review the police, 
members of the council assure 
their support and appreciation 
of the police and hope for 
further improvement.

“This process doesn’t mean 

that we’re going to find that 
our police are doing everything 
wrong, it’s just going to give us 
enough information so that we 
can make improvements. We 
have a really excellent police 
department,” Eaton said. “I 
believe if we are doing proactive 
policing rather than reactive 
policing, that the officer has 
the ability to develop those 
personal 
relationships 
with 

the community that they don’t 
have time to do when they’re 
running from one call to the 
next.”

Overall, Lazarus highlighted 

the city staff and community’s 
aim to meet the same end goal — 
a functioning commission that 
will keep the police in check 
and build more trust within the 
Ann Arbor community.

“I remain excited about the 

path forward … it has been 
a challenge in many ways. I 
think the staff and I have kept 
true faith and allegiance with 
the community as we’ve gone 
through developing a scope of 
work and receiving a report 
from the outside consultant and 
translating that into action,” 
Lazarus said. “I think we 
all need to take a breath and 
appreciate the magnitude of 
what we’re doing and jump into 
it enthusiastically.”

In an interview, Holloway 

explained his desire to present 
on this topic, saying as a trans 
man, he feels his experience 
regarding the topic he presented 
on catered to a more inclusive 
discussion.

“It’s very personal for me 

because I am a trans person,” 
Holloway said. “I want to spread 
information that I feel is from a 
very trans-perspective. I would 
rather a trans person present 
on trans topics than a cisgender 
person.”

According to the Merriam-

Webster dictionary, cisgender 
is defined as someone who 
identifies with the gender with 
which they were born.

Later in the presentation, 

Holloway 
explained 
the 

three C’s of communication: 
consent, communication and 
creativity. He emphasized that 
communication between sexual 

partners is important in order to 
have a worthwhile experience.

“Communication 
is 
key,” 

Holloway 
said. 
“Sex 
looks 

different for every single person 
that you are going to come 
across. Your definition of sex 
may differ from my definition 
of sex ... consent is mandatory.”

The 
presentation 
also 

included 
statistics 
gathered 

from the 2015 U.S. Transgender 
Survey. 
According 
to 
the 

survey, 33 percent of trans 
people who saw a health care 
provider 
stated 
they 
had 

negative experiences regarding 
their health, 24 percent had to 
teach their medical provider 
about their health as a trans 
individual and 23 percent did 
not consult a doctor at all for 
fear of mistreatment because of 
their identity.

UHS Mental Health Care 

Manager 
Diana 
Parrish 

announced UHS is also working 
to provide more services catered 
toward 
transgender-related 

health care, such as prescribing 
hormone treatments. Currently, 
those who wish to receive 

treatments have to go to outside 
providers.

“We are working on having 

in-house providers who can 
initiate hormones which would 
be a major way of access for 
healthcare,” Parrish said.

LSA

she specifically learned about

“One of the biggest things I

for trans folks,” Leggett said. “I 
had a trans friend in high school 
and didn’t realize all that he 
was going through.”

by LSA lecturers. 

SG members questioned the 

source of the money for a salary 
raise and whether it would 
come from a rise in tuition 
or University reserves. LSA 
sophomore 
Brooke 
Lennox 

spoke on the conversations 
she has had with her Russian 
professor regarding the issue 
and claims that University 
regents 
have 
the 
funding 

for raises. Lennox believes 
the issue is instead about 
convincing regents to allocate 
their resources toward these 
raises.

“I am in huge support of 

this,” Lennox said.

LSA 
SG 
members 
also 

introduced 
an 
amendment 

to 
previous 
election 
rules, 

focusing on their discussion 
during 
the 
election 
and 

clarifying the language of the 
law. The goal of the resolution 
is 
to 
streamline 
internal 

elections by fostering debate 
from all candidates at the start 
rather than having to repeat 
elections, as has been done in 
years past. LSA SG members 
also 
encouraged 
using 

comprehensive 
language 
to 

reduce confusion for members 
in the future.

Members 
then 
discussed 

an amendment to reform the 
Communications Committee’s 
ThisSucks@umich.edu, 
proposing 
to 
replace 
the 

“ThisSucks” account with a 
more 
centralized 
complaint 

form on their website. The 
sponsors of this resolution 
explained that this web page, 
Campus 
Complaints, 
would 

increase 
accessibility 
to 

constituents and amplify their 
voiced concerns.

LSA SG also addressed their 

internal climate, presenting an 
amendment about gendered 
language within their bylaws. 
The body passed a similar 
resolution in 2016, but is 
working to strengthen their 
bylaws to enforce the abolition 
of gendered language within 

their documents and meetings. 
 

Admitting 
that 
it 
is 

difficult to enforce the use of 
gender-inclusive 
language, 

the 
sponsors 
urged 
the 

responsibility of every member 
to be inclusive. Members 
agreed the purpose of this 
resolution 
is 
to 
advocate 

for inclusive language and 
to encourage people to be 
educated on the issue.

LSA SG members attested 

to the effectiveness of such a 
resolution, despite the inability 
to be measured metrically, 
claiming that they have seen 
change 
since 
the 
original 

resolution in 2016. Their 
bylaws no longer include “he,” 
“him,” or other gender-specific 
pronouns, while other student 
governments’ bylaws allegedly 
still do.

External Relations Officer 

Lorraine 
Furtado 
said 
the 

committee will continue to 
fight 
for 
gender-inclusive 

language.

“We’ll be here for you to 

help 
advocate 
for 
gender 

inclusiveness,” she said.

I want to spread 
information that I 
feel is from a very 
trans-perspective


T

hink of the number of 
hours that you spend 
on your phone per day. 

Whether you relentlessly post 
on Instagram or you regularly 
read the news, I’m sure that 
you spend way more time on 
your phone than you would like 
to admit.
 I recently began consciously 
monitoring my phone usage, 
and if you’re anything like me, 
you probably waste at least a 
few hours a day on your phone. 
Initially, I thought that a few 
hours a day wasn’t terrible. This 
reaction, however, was simply 
a way to resist my ultimate 
realization: I was addicted to 
my phone. 
 If you think about it, I’m sure 
many of you are the same way. 
We check our phones as soon 
as we wake up, all throughout 
the day and then one last time 
right before we fall asleep 
(usually 
for 
several 
hours 

before actually falling asleep). 
We hit the home button, hoping 
for 
a 
notification, 
anytime 

we feel bored or awkward or 
anxious. Our phones are there 
for us, with an infinite amount 
of stimulation to distract us 
whenever we need it.
 I began thinking about my 
phone 
usage 
(and 
overall 

technology usage) when several 
publications, 
including 
The 

New York Times and The Wall 
Street Journal, reported on 
an open letter sent to Apple 
Inc. about the negative effects 
smartphones 
can 
have 
on 

children. The media has begun 
scrutinizing these companies 
for 
potentially 
exploiting 

human behavior in search of 
excessive profits.
 Our phones, paired with 
the 
social 
media 
apps 
on 

their interfaces, captivate us 
with their consistent, never-
ending 
information 
stream. 

In an essay, Nicholas Carr, a 
renowned author on the subject 
of technology and its impact 
on society, wrote, “(the brain’s) 
attention is drawn toward any 
object that is new, intriguing 

or otherwise striking.” Social 
media relies on this truth to 
profitably 
capture 
as 
much 

attention as possible. YouTube 
keeps 
us 
watching 
with 

its 
“autoplay” 
feature, 
and 

Instagram keeps us scrolling on 
the “explore” page.
 The addictive nature of 
phones and their apps have 
harmful 
consequences 
for 

each and every user. The 
Journal of the Association for 
Consumer Research published 
a report that noted even the 
presence of a smartphone 
can 
significantly 
reduce 

cognitive performance on a 
variety of tests. Our phones 
are constantly asking for our 
attention — even when we’re 
not necessarily using them. 
The research demonstrates 
how our phones can inhibit 
us from reaching our true 
cognitive potential.
 The consequences of social 
media are even more severe. 
Holly 
Shakya, 
associate 

professor at the University 
of 
California, 
San 
Diego, 

and Nicholas Christakis, Sol 
Goldman 
Family 
professor 

at Yale University, found in a 
landmark study that “the use 
of Facebook was negatively 
associated with overall well-
being.” Meaning, the more time 
you spend on social media, the 
unhappier you feel. Frequent 
social 
media 
users 
report 

feeling depressed and lonely, 
and 
they 
also 
experience 

resentment, or jealousy, of 
their supposed “friends” when 
checking social media. 
 
It’s 
not 
just 
academics 

scrutinizing the tech giants. 
Investors are even starting 
to call for change. Two Apple 
Inc. investors, who control 
approximately $2 billion of 
the tech company’s shares, 
recently sent a letter to its 
board of directors criticizing 
the 
iPhone’s 
influence 
on 

children. The investors, along 
with much of the public, have 
become concerned over the 
effect that phones will have on 

Generation Z, the generation 
that is growing up surrounded 
by smartphones.
 In addition, the Campaign for 
a Commercial-Free Childhood, 
a group of pediatric and mental 
health experts, wrote a letter to 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
urging 
him 
to 
discontinue 

the 
new 
Messenger 
Kids 

app. The group is concerned 
with 
Facebook 
preying 
on 

a vulnerable portion of the 
population in what is likely an 
effort to create lifelong users of 
the social media platform.
 
Lawmakers 
are 
similarly 

beginning to scrutinize these 
companies because of the 
negative 
externalities 
that 

their products and services 
bring to society. Facebook was 
initially scrutinized because 
of the alleged Russian efforts 
to influence the latest U.S. 
presidential election via the 
platform, 
but 
lawmakers 

are now raising important 
questions 
relating 
to 
not 

only 
misinformation 
with 

Facebook but also consumer 
protection with regard to all 
of the tech giants.
 Tech giants may face heightened 
regulations in the coming years, 
but I hope that they will realize 
their externalities to society 
and make meaningful changes 
on their own. These companies 
have a unique opportunity to 
make their products and services 
more 
responsible 
without 

governmental intervention, and 
I hope that they take advantage 
of it. I hope that they will 
develop safeguards for children 
and reduce or eliminate their 
platform’s 
habit-forming 

qualities without being forced 
to do so.
 Those affected may already be 
addicted, but the least we can do 
is help the coming generations 
use these products and services 
more wisely.

I

t’s no secret that gender 
norms 
are 
perpetuated 

in 
society 
and 
have 

undoubtedly 
spawned 
a 

restrictive 
set 
of 
socially-

acceptable 
behaviors 
that 

dictate how people should act 
based on their gender.
 One report conducted by the 
Global Early Adolescent Study 
shows the prevailing effects 
of 
gender 
norms 
globally. 

The 
study 
questioned 
450 

adolescents and their parents 
across 
15 
countries. 
The 

participants ranged from 10 to 
14 years old. After looking at the 
results, Robert Blum, director 
of 
the 
Global 
Adolescent 

Study 
and 
a 
professor 
at 

Johns 
Hopkins 
University, 

concluded, “children at a very 
early age — from the most 
conservative 
to 
the 
most 

liberal 
societies 
— 
quickly 

internalize 
this 
myth 
that 

girls are vulnerable and boys 
are strong and independent.” 
Blum’s 
explanation 
of 
the 

study’s results reaffirms the 
well-known truth that young 
girls are raised to be meek 
and vulnerable. Furthermore, 
young girls are also sexualized 
from a young age; one paper 
published as part of the study 
stated, 
“Around 
the 
world 

pubertal boys are viewed as 
predators and girls as potential 
targets and victims. Messages 
such as — do not sit like that, 
do not wear that, do not talk to 
him, boys will ruin your future 
— support the gender division 
of power … In some places, 
girls come to internalize these 
norms to even a greater extent 
than boys.”
 Of course, it isn’t just young 
girls who are controlled by 
gender roles; young boys, too, 
are often expected to act in a 
certain way. An article from 
The 
Guardian 
noted 
that 

because boys are expected 
to be brave and tough since 
a young age, “they engage in 
and are the victims of physical 
violence to a much greater 
extent than girls; they die more 
frequently from unintentional 
injuries, are more prone to 
substance abuse and suicide; 
and 
as 
adults 
their 
life 

expectancy is shorter than that 
of women.” In addition, men 
are often discouraged from 
expressing 
their 
emotions, 

and are condemned for crying 
in particular. While shaming 
a man for crying is sexist 
because the act is shamed 
for 
being 
too 
“feminine” 

(evidenced by common insults 
such as “crying like a little 
girl”) there’s no doubt that 
men are taught that they must 
not show any emotions that 
exhibit vulnerability.
 
Gender 
roles 
have 
also 

paradoxically 
created 
the 

false assumption that people 
must reject all qualities of the 
socially-quintessential man or 
woman in order to fight gender 
norms. Choosing not to partake 
in stereotypically “feminine” 
activities, such as putting on 
makeup 
or 
shopping, 
does 

not fight gender norms. The 
same goes for men; avoiding 
stereotypically 
“masculine” 

activities 
such 
as 
playing 

sports does not help in the 
fight against gender norms. 
Neither does shaming those 
who choose to embody certain 
characteristics that make up 
gender norms.
 For example, many people 
shame women who choose to 
stay at home with their kids and 
take care of the household for 
having “easy” jobs. In an article 
in the Huff Post, Michelle 
Zunter, a stay-at-home mom, 
discussed how working moms 
will often say to her, “‘I wish 
I could stay home like you but 
someone has to work and pay 
the bills!’”
 As someone who knows 
several 
stay-at-home 
moms, 

I take umbrage with this 
statement 
because 
I 
have 

witnessed 
firsthand 
how 

difficult it is to keep an entire 
household running, and staying 
at home should not be conflated 
with not working. In addition, 
the assumption that stay-at-
home moms don’t do any work 
shames women who choose 
to follow gender norms not 
because they are forced to, 
but because they want to. It 
creates yet another standard by 
which women feel forced to do 
something, instead of choosing 
of their free will.
 Another example that affects 
men 
are 
the 
stereotypes 

associated with men who fit 
the imposed gender norm of 
enjoying sports; for example, 
stereotypes such as the “dumb 
jock” suggest men who are 
athletic are not intelligent. And 
though men are often viewed 
in society as being superior to 
women in terms of intelligence, 
these 
negative 
stereotypes 

that punish those who seem 
hypermasculine do not help 
fight gender roles or sexism; 
they 
only 
create 
another 

restrictive 
label. 
Reducing 

every man who likes to watch 
football to a crazed, violent 
sports 
fanatic 
isn’t 
doing 

anyone a favor.
 I am not trying to champion 
those who choose to conform 
to gender roles, nor am I 
trying to shame those who 
don’t. However, I do believe 
avoiding qualities associated 
with a gender norm is not 
helpful: Rather, rejecting the 
association of qualities with 
specific genders, as well as the 
negative connotation associated 
with 
being 
masculine 
or 

feminine, is what is important. 
A woman isn’t “masculine” if 
she works outside the home or is 
athletic. A man isn’t “feminine” 
if he prefers to spend time inside 
or if he expresses his emotions 
freely. In addition, women who 
prefer to work at home and 
men who pride themselves on 
their athletic abilities aren’t 
complicit 
in 
perpetuating 

gender norms.
 
Using 
labels 
such 
as 

“masculine” and “feminine” 
is not necessarily bad, but 
using the terms to perpetuate 
negative stereotypes or shame 
others is harmful. The goal 
of 
rejecting 
gender 
norms 

is not to create a different 
set of restrictions, but to 
allow people to act how they 
want without being shamed. 
Therefore, in order to reject 
harmful gender norms, we 
must not condemn all of the 
characteristics that make up a 
norm and instead get rid of the 
gendering of said qualities.
 This is easier said than done, 
but we can take steps to work 
toward abolishing controlling 
gender norms. We can teach 
girls and boys that their place 
is where they want it to be, 
inside or outside the house. 
We can stop telling men 
who are not stereotypically 
masculine to “man up” and 
stop telling women who are 
not stereotypically feminine 
to act more ladylike. However, 
because 
fighting 
gender 

norms also means not blaming 
those who may fit the mold, we 
must also not criticize women 
for being “girly,” or men for 
being hypermasculine. Once 
again, the point of fighting 
gender norms is to liberate 
people, not to restrict them in 
different ways.

Rejecting gender norms

KRYSTAL HUR | COLUMN

f you’ve attended a J 
Street U event at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

in the last two years, you’ve 
probably heard of Susya. Maybe 
you’ve seen pictures of its 
children or hillsides. Maybe 
you’ve listened to stories from 
people who have traveled there. 
Maybe you’ve even made phone 
calls to government officials 
about it or posted #SaveSusya and 
#WontLookAway on social media.
 The village of Susya lies in 
the South Hebron Hills, in the 
area of the West Bank, known 
as Area C, which is under 
full Israeli military control. 
Susya is currently home to 
350 Palestinian people. Unless 
people take action, more than 
40 residents of Susya could 
soon lose their homes.
 
The 
Israeli 
far-right 

settler 
movement, 
led 
by 

the 
organization 
Regavim, 

has 
spent 
the 
last 
few 

years lobbying the Israeli 
government 
to 
demolish 

Susya and villages like it so 
that Israeli settlements can 
expand through the South 
Hebron 
Hills. 
Persistent 

demolitions 
of 
Palestinian 

communities 
deep 
within 

the West Bank are part of 
their strategy of creeping 
annexation. 
The 
far-right 

movement hopes to secure a 
“Greater Israel,” expanding 
Israeli control over land that 
would become a future state 
of Palestine after a negotiated 
two-state solution. In effect, 
these efforts are eliminating 

the possibility of a two-state 
solution to the conflict, and 
both peace and security for all 
Israelis and Palestinians.
 Israeli security professionals 
have spoken out about the 
dangers of creeping annexation 
and the entrenchment of the 
occupation. 
They 
recognize 

that the demolition of Susya 
would 
clear 
the 
way 
for 

the 
demolitions 
of 
other 

vulnerable 
villages 
facing 

similar threats, and turn the 
possibility of a peaceful two-
state solution into an imposed 
one-state 
nightmare. 
These 

members of the Israeli security 
establishment are joined by 
United 
States 
lawmakers 

such as Sens. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., and Dianne Feinstein, 
D-Calif., who wrote a letter in 
November that was co-signed 
by eight additional senators 
expressing opposition to home 
demolitions and the threat of 
creeping annexation.
 Over the past year, J Street U 
students from the Univeristy 
and across the U.S. have 
developed a relationship with 
Susya. 
Our 
students 
have 

traveled to the village to speak 
with community leaders about 
their lives and the challenges 
they face. This fall, J Street 
U hosted Susya resident and 
village spokesperson Nasser 
Nawaj’ah at multiple national 
gatherings 
of 
students, 

where he spoke about the 
uncertainty he feels about 
his children’s security and 
future. 
Through 
our 
Stop 

Demolitions, 
Build 
Peace 

campaign, we have voiced 
resistance to the demolition of 
Susya through education and 
solidarity events.
 Now, more than ever, it is 
critical for us to stand in 
solidarity 
with 
Susya. 
On 

Feb. 1, the Israeli Supreme 
Court decided to permit the 
demolition of seven structures 
in the village. These structures 
are home to more than 40 
people, half of whom are 
children 
or 
elderly. 
When 

exactly these orders will be 
carried out is unclear, but it is 
now possible for bulldozers to 
drive into Susya at any time.
 J Street U University students 
call on our fellow students and 
community members to oppose 
this decision. Statements and 
pressure from U.S. leadership 
have 
successfully 
delayed 

demolitions in the past. In 
response to the court decision 
announcement, Feinstein and 
Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., 
put out statements standing up 
for Susya. We call on our elected 
representatives to follow their 
example of leadership on this 
issue. It is critical that we make 
our voices heard now, for the 
sake of the people of Susya and 
a peaceful future for Israelis 
and Palestinians.

Rich Brian may have just 
surprised everyone.
Born and raised in Jakarta, 
Indonesia, he rose to internet 
fame under the name “Rich 
Chigga” with the viral music 
video he created for his song 
“Dat $tick,” a decent song that 
suffered 
from 
not being able to 
decide whether it 
was a joke or not. 
He’s an unlikely 
success story: He 
learned both how 
to speak English 
and how to rap off of YouTube 
as an adolescent, and he only 
turned 18 a few months ago.
With 
Amen, 
along 
with 
the name change, Rich Brian 
is clearly trying to be taken 
more seriously. If he tried 
and failed to pivot away from 
his comedic roots, he would 
risk going the route of Lil 
Dicky and plummeting into 
irrelevance. However, if he 
totally abandoned his past as 
a “meme rapper” he would be 
flirting with losing the very 
fanbase that got him popular 
in the first place. Rich Brian 
was walking a tightrope — he 
had to balance his viral fame 
with his artistic output — and I 
think Amen can be considered 
a successful exercise in doing 
so, in spite of its flaws.
There are some exceptional 
tracks 
on 
this 
record 
— 
“Glow Like Dat,” “Cold” and 
“Arizona” are among the best 

songs on the album — and any 
one of these would represent a 
substantive development from 
the “Dat $tick” days.
Certain tracks demonstrate 
a 
knack 
for 
careful 
experimentation that could 
yield interesting results in 
times to come: “Introvert” 
is 
worth 
discussing, 
light 
yet dissonant with a driving 
groove and featuring fellow 
88rising member Joji, another 
internet 
star 
attempting 
to 
transition 
to 
being 
taken 
seriously as an 
artist. 
“Flight” 
is also unique, a 
pulsating 
synth 
core draped with gentle bells 
and a reverb-soaked hook.
“Little 
Prince” 
and 
“Arizona” are both much more 
atmospheric 
and 
peaceful 
than the rest of the album, 
with smooth hooks lent to 
both by relatively unknown 
vocalists (NIKI and AUGUST 
08, respectively).
The album had its share of 
low points: “Attention” was a 
little disappointing for having 
the big-ticket Offset feature; 
the beat was serviceable but 
it felt like Offset phoned it in. 
For most of his verse he was 
spitting like he was reading 
his bars off of a teleprompter. 
Maybe I’m just tired of him 
after having to sit through all 
of Culture II last week. I don’t 
know, either way the track 
didn’t grab me.
This is an album where the 
production really does the 
heavy lifting, which would be 

an indictment of Rich Brian 
if he didn’t also produce 
most of the album. Given his 
rather repetitive and often 
monotonous flow, I might 
wager that he is actually more 
talented as a producer than 

he is as a rapper. His bars 
can straddle the line between 
funny and lame (“Every week, 
I be on her face, she think 
it’s Cetaphil”), and while his 
singing voice is not technically 
proficient, it has character, 
redolent of Kid Cudi’s singing 
style. However, at the age of 
18, he still has plenty of time 
to improve upon his weak 
areas, and I would look to his 
next project as an indication of 
whether Rich Brian is a flash 
in the pan or if he’ll be around 
for good.

‘Amen’ a surprising risk

FILM REVIEW

With 
recent 
popularized 
animated 
pictures 
like 
“Paddington 2” and “Cars 3” 
on the market, “Bilal: A New 
Breed of Hero,” an animated film 
about enslavement and religious 
tyranny taking place 1,500 years 
ago is an undeniable hard-sell 
for modern audiences. However, 
versions of this storyline have 
in fact sold before, and have 
successfully 
awed 
modern 

viewers. Take the remarkable 
masterpiece that is “The Prince 
of Egypt,” a film about Moses 
and 
the 
oppression 
of 
the 
Israelite people. Though the 
concept sounds rather dry, the 
film holds the attention of the 
audience until the end through 
a 
rhythmically 
captivating 
soundtrack 
and 
impressive 
character 
growth. 
Despite 
following a somewhat similar 
narrative to “The Prince of 
Egypt,” “Bilal” falls far short of 
its potential. 
Taking 
place 
1,500 
years 
ago in a religiously corrupt 
and 
slavery 
ridden 
portion 
of the Middle East, “Bilal” 
begins with the uprooting of 
protagonist Bilal’s world as his 
home is invaded, his mother is 
presumably killed and he and 
his sister are sold into slavery. 
The remainder of the film 
tracks Bilal through his journey 
from childhood to manhood. 
Increasingly 
intolerant 
with 
the societal oppression he faces, 
Bilal ignites a flame within 
the hearts of his tyrannized 
community 
and 
sparks 
a 
rebellion 
against 
the 
slave 
masters. Despite its startling 

and emotional beginning, the 
remainder of the film steadily 
loses its momentum, lacking a 
pulse entirely by the end. 
However, to the film’s credit, 
the quality of the animation is 
truly mesmerizing. The vivid 
reds, golds, blues, purples and 
browns used throughout the film, 
the motif of sand and the slow 
motion and flashback sequences 
undeniably add to the cinematic 
beauty. The flashbacks, which 
often transport the audience 
into Bilal’s memories of his 
mother, who serves as a guiding 
voice within him throughout the 
movie, are especially impactful. 
These moments function as 
marking points, indicating the 
growing resistance within Bilal 
as his intolerance to his figurative 
and literal chains develops. Also 
praiseworthy is the film’s telling 
of a story more diverse than the 
typical animation flick. Even 
though the film is set far in the 
past, it holds some relevance to 
the current political climate, and 
its introduction of an unfamiliar 
narrative about a Middle Eastern 
(rather than white) hero to 
American audiences is welcomed 
and extremely refreshing. 
Though 
components 
of 
“Bilal” do hold some value, its 
overall quality is overpowered 
by 
mishaps 
in 
character 
development, 
unengaging 
and 
bland 
dialogue 
and 
oversimplification. 
Despite 
his physical aging throughout 
the film and his progressive 
internal 
dissatisfaction 
with 
his 
maltreatment, 
Bilal’s 
character evolution is deficient 
and he comes off as bland. 
Partly to blame for this is the 
surface level, black and white 
relationships 
that 
Bilal 
has 
with the characters around 
him. This is a film with no grey 
characters, and by extension, no 
questioning of who is righteous 
and who is evil. Obviously, the 
man in the black and red garb 
with narrowed eyes and a smirk 
on his face is villainous, and of 
course Bilal and his companions, 
who dress mostly in cream 

and tan colored clothing, have 
stunning eyes and soothing 
voices, are the upstanding guys. 
This lack of complexity makes 
characters incredibly intangible, 
and 
prevents 
viewers 
from 
investing any real emotion in 
them. Tied to a lack of depth is 
a shortcoming with dialogue. 
With so much of the film 
consisting of repetitive, back-
to-back moments of struggling 
and overcoming, dialogue and 
character growth are placed 
toward the backburner. The 
conversations had by characters 
do the bare minimum, enough 
to keep the plot going, but not 
enough to actually make viewers 
care about what is being said. 
“Bilal” 
is 
best 
described 
as a big ball of unharnessed 
potential. On the plus side, 
the film enlightens viewers to 
an empowering, unique and 
inspiring true story. At the 
same time, however, it misses 
the mark by failing to tell that 
same story in a non-generic and 
though-provoking manner. By 
the end of the film, viewers are 

left dissatisfied and wondering 
whether the seven dollars they 
paid at the box office were worth 
it, or if they could have obtained 
equal 
entertainment 
from 
looking up the story of the real 
Bilal online for free. 

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

 If David Fincher directed 
“Carol” (2015) in an Ortho-
dox Jewish community, it 
would look a lot like “Dis-
obedience.” Based on the 
novel of the same name by 
Naomi Alderman, “Disobedi-
ence” tackles homosexual-
ity within the confines of 
the isolated and restrictive 
Ultra-Orthodox London 
community of Hendon. The 
trailer evokes the pace and 
tone of a thriller filled with 
forbidden passion and desire 
while touching on the more 
nuanced themes of the con-
stricting boundaries of the 
Orthodox Jewish world. 
When Ronit (Rachel Weisz, 
“Denial”) returns to the 
community that exiled her 
for her sexuality to mourn 
her Rabbi father’s death, 
she encounters her former 
lesbian lover, Esti (Rachel 
McAdams, “Spotlight”). 
Since their affair, Esti has 

married Ronit’s cousin 
and her father’s successor, 

Dovid (Alessandro Nivola, 
“American Hustle”). The 
film, directed and adapted 
for the screen by Chilean 
director Sebastián Lelio (“A 
Fantastic Woman,” which 
happens to be nominated for 
Best Foreign Language Film 
at the Oscars this year) is 
yet another step in the right 
direction for representation 
of homosexual love stories, 
even Jewish homosexual 
love stories, on screen. We 
have come a long way from 
“Kissing Jessica Stein” 
(2001) in terms of Jewish 
homosexuality with a bond 

beyond stars of David and 
circumcisions with Elio and 
Oliver in “Call Me by Your 
Name” (2017). Hopefully, 
“Disobedience” will serve to 
provide a similar lens of vis-
ibility to those underrepre-
sented stories in Hollywood. 
Similarly, “Disobedience” 
sheds light on the equally 
underrepresented world of 
the Orthodox community. 
The year 2017 saw A24’s 
Yiddish film “Menashe,” 
taking place in New York’s 
Hasidic Williamsburg with 
real-life Hasidim and Netf-
lix’s documentary on life in 
that community in “One of 
Us.” Hopefully, in addition 
to providing visibility to the 
underrepresented, “Disobe-
dience” will tell a story of 
intimacy and passion that 
has yet to be told.

About halfway through the first 
episode of “The Trade” — a new 
five-part docuseries on the opioid 
epidemic from Showtime — we 
meet Jen Walton, whose sons, 
Skyler and Avery, are addicted to 
heroin. “Skyler would walk over 
my dead body to get his drug,” she 
says, almost matter-of-factly.
It’s 
a 
moment 
of 
weary 
resignation, and “The Trade” is 
full of those. There’s Don Miguel, 

the boss of an opium poppy field in 
southwestern Mexico, confessing 
that he knows heroin is a harmful 
drug, but it’s the only way to make 
a living. And Detective Mark 
Edwards 
in 
Columbus, 
Ohio, 
busting small-time dealers and 
beginning to realize that nothing is 
changing.
“The Trade” is an unvarnished, 
character-driven examination of 
the opioid epidemic told through 
the lives of those it touches, and 
director and producer Matthew 
Heineman (“City of Ghosts”) — 
whose 
previous 
documentary 

subjects include violent drug cartels 
and Syrian citizen journalists — 
isn’t one to shy away from difficult 
themes or complicated people.
Heineman is given unbelievable 
access 
to 
his 
subjects: 
law 
enforcement officials, heroin users 
and growers. The result is intensely 
cinematic, and at times, when we’re 
frighteningly close to someone 
shooting up heroin or stirring vats 
of chemicals, it can be easy to forget 
that this is all unscripted.

BOOKS

“Even if we don’t have the 
power to choose where we 
come from, we can still choose 
where we go from there.”
It was the summer before 
ninth grade.
I 
was 
lounging 
next 
to a pool at a Hawaiian 
hotel, 
encumbered 
by 
my 
perpetually anxious thoughts, 
when my sister handed me a 
book and said, “You should 
read this.” I took a good look 
at it: The cover was attractive 
and minimalist, a mix of pale 
green and forest brown, and 
it felt skinny enough that 
reading it didn’t seem like 
much of a challenge (spoiler 
alert: It wasn’t). I spent the 
next three days engulfing 
myself in the text, flipping 
through every page without 
hesitation. When I finished 
Stephen 
Chbosky’s 
“The 
Perks of Being a Wallflower,” 
I knew instantly it was not 
only my new favorite book — 
before it had been, naturally, 
J.D. Salinger’s “Catcher in 
the Rye” — but that it had 
reassured almost every single 
fear I was facing about high 
school up until that point.
Coming-of-age 
stories 
have always been my favorite 
subgenre 
of 
American 
literature — and narrative art 
in general — but there hasn’t 
been a coming-of-age story 
I’ve read quite like “The Perks 
of Being a Wallflower.” Set 
in the early ’90s, the novel is 
presented in a series of soulful, 
intimate 
journal 
entries 
written by the protagonist 
Charlie, a perceptive introvert 
from 
suburban 
Pittsburgh 
who wrestles with childhood 
traumas and a fear of rejection 
as he enters his first year of 
high school. Soon, however, 
Charlie 
befriends 
step-
siblings 
Patrick 
and 
Sam, 
both ambitious, extroverted 
upperclassmen who help push 
Charlie out of his comfort 
zone and realize his potential. 
As he experiments with LSD, 
creates melancholic mixtapes 
and revels in watching glitzy 
live performances of “The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show” 
— you know, classic high 
school stuff — Charlie comes 
closer to his true self, even 
as he confronts his darkest 
memories, 
the 
ones 
that 
attempt to lure him back into 

isolation. 
“The Perks of Being a 
Wallflower” 
aches 
with 
a 
tenderness and vulnerability I 
have yet to see in other novels. 
Every sentence, every careful 
observation 
from 
Charlie, 
oozes 
with 
an 
unbridled 
adolescent 
angst 
that’s 
devastatingly honest in one 
moment, honestly devastating 
in the next. In some ways, 
the 
book 
narratively 
and 
thematically 
mirrors 
its 
spiritual predecessor “Catcher 
in the Rye,” but Charlie is 
never 
as 
misanthropic 
or 
self-aggrandizing as Holden 
Caulfield. Instead, Chbosky 
embeds 
an 
uncommonly 
genuine kindness into Charlie, 

as well as an alluring cultured 
taste — his character takes a 
liking to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 
“This Side of Paradise,” The 
Smiths and “The Graduate.”
The book is a stunning 
portrait of what it’s like 
to 
feel 
so 
uncomfortable 
with yourself, so lost in the 
burrows of your past that the 
only way to overcome such 
pain is through the people 
who matter in your present 
— whether it’s your friends, 
family or teachers. Charlie 
learns this in the defining 
moments 
that 
make 
and 

break his freshman year: He 
reluctantly begins his first 
romantic relationship with 
Sam and Patrick’s punk-rock 
friend Mary Elizabeth, takes 
his older sister Candace to 
an abortion clinic, gets into a 
rough fight with some bullies 
and admits his love for Sam 
in one of the book’s most 
elegantly written scenes.
With 
each 
trial 
and 
tribulation 
that 
dictates 
his high school experience, 
Charlie starts to become a 
better version of himself. He 
starts to “participate,” as he 
would call it. Charlie’s coming 
to 
terms 
with 
disturbing 
truths about his youth may 
have led to a harrowing — 
though ultimately optimistic 
— conclusion, but the fear he 
once had about wanting to fit 
in and be accepted for who he 
was quietly subsides over the 
course of the book. In the final 
pages, I could feel a renewed 
confidence, a joyful wisdom 
emanating from Charlie that 
I have carried with me ever 
since.
High school can be such an 
intense emotional experience. 
Every day can feel like the 
end of the world, a seemingly 
never-ending cycle of soul-
crushing misery propagated 
by social alienation, academic 
pressure, unrequited love, a 
lack of independence, severe 
boredom 
and 
idealized 
expectations 
from 
society 
and family. Inevitably, we 
turn to music, film, literature 
and 
our 
own 
friends 
to 
guide us toward a sense of 
clarity, and perhaps to also 
fill the void of despair and 
rage that seems to ravage 
every teenager who has ever 
existed. Before I started high 
school, I was frightened by 
the prospect of experiencing 
a repeat of middle school, a 
time that was beset with the 
manifestation of my worst 
insecurities. 
Fortunately, 
high school helped me prevail 
against that current of dread 
— and then some.
And though my high school 
experience 
may 
not 
have 
been as exciting or as chaotic 
as Charlie’s, “Perks of Being 
a Wallflower” was a great 
compass for immersing me 
into a world I was myself 
scared to enter, but eventually 
learned to embrace.

The Books That 
Built Us: ‘Perks’

Every sentence, 

every careful 

observation from 

Charlie, oozes 

with an unbridled 

adolescent 

angst that’s 

devastatingly 

honest in one 

moment, honestly 

devastating in the 

next

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

The historical misconceptions 
perpetuated through ‘Hamilton’

This past week, I watched 
the performance of “Hamilton” 
from the 2016 Tony awards in my 
musicology class. As we watched 
the video, I was struck by the 
outstanding popularity of this 
music among many of my fellow 
School of Music, Theater & Dance 
classmates. As far as I could tell, 
no one in my class was hearing the 
music for the first time. Though a 
few students explained that they 
had outgrown the “Hamilton” 
craze, everyone seemed to be 
intimately familiar with each 
word in the musical.
The topic of my class is 
contemporary American music. 
When discussing the role of 
“Hamilton” 
in 
contemporary 
American culture, we all had 
well-defined understandings of 
the significance of the musical. 
Depicting the history of the 
Founding Fathers with actors of 
color, we felt, was clearly intended 
to make a statement about the 
diverse nature of our modern 
nation. 
Various 
subthemes 
existed throughout the musical, 
we decided, such as the integral 
role of immigrants in American 
society and the ever-changing 
definition of what it means to be 
an American perpetuated through 
our historical understanding of 
our founding fathers.
When it came to discussing the 
legacy of Alexander Hamilton, 
however, the class was quite 
divided. Culturally, Hamilton has 
developed a historical connotation 
as a diverse and inclusive liberal 
icon. For many, he is an example 
of our democratic society. He was 
a self-made man, an immigrant 
whose 
wealth 
and 
power 
stemmed almost entirely from 
his speaking and writing abilities. 
He represents the successes of 
our meritocracy. Thanks to the 
musical, he has been idealized as 
a bastion of modern day liberal/
progressive politics.
Hamilton’s historical legacy, 
however, may not be as clear cut as 
his current cultural status would 
lead us to believe. His role in 
polarizing the politics of his day, 

for example, is briefly depicted in 
the play, though it is frequently 
glossed over in the cultural 
lexicon. Even this slightly more 
complicated view of Hamilton 
may not be entirely accurate; 
with some further research one 
can learn of Hamilton’s anti-
democratic, almost authoritarian 
tendencies. 
Historians 
have 
frequently alleged, for example, 
that he believed in an unequal 
distribution of wealth as a means 
of maintaining a class structure in 
American society. He advocated 
that the president receive a life 
term, an idea clearly at odds with 
the current political left and 
the various efforts underway 
to impeach our President. His 
participation in the 1783 attempt 
to overthrow the Continental 
Congress by harboring the anger of 
the unpaid soldiers, furthermore, 
is just as decidedly undemocratic 
as it is un-American.
I don’t mean to suggest that 
Hamilton represents a negative 
force in American politics — 
many of his financial policies are 
still in use today. His arguments 
in the Federalist Papers are still 
referenced today as the reasoning 
behind our system of government. 
It is not Hamilton’s legacy that 
should be questioned but the role 
that the musical “Hamilton” has 
played in shaping and defining 
this legacy.
As was demonstrated in my 
musicology 
class, 
Hamilton’s 
current cultural legacy is built 
on the success of “Hamilton” 
and not his role in history. This 
musical-based historical legacy is 
constantly reinforced throughout 
our cultural landscape. It’s a 
cultural feedback loop of sorts: 
The legacy encourages us to follow 
the principles of “Hamilton,” 
rather then the policies that 
the real Hamilton would have 
supported. 
It is not difficult to move 
from this cultural phenomenon 
to the larger world as politics 
become increasingly polarized. If 
anything, the hyperpolarization 
of modern politics are almost 
perfectly 
represented 
by 
the 
codification 
of 
this 
pseudo-
historical 
legacy. 
Unlike 
any 
other time in history, the rapid 

and 
indiscriminate 
flow 
of 
information known as the internet 
is encouraging the formation of 
distinct subcultures within our 
greater national culture. We are 
not a country divided — we are 
a country diverging into various 

independent and largely dissimilar 
subcultures. In previous decades, 
these subcultures were defined 
by geography. Now, more than 
they were before, they are based 
on other principles; economic 
conditions, 
race, 
class 
and 
(arguably) population density.
Each subculture has its own 
set of beliefs and its own history 
used to justify these beliefs. To 
those that believe in immigration 
and diversity as the foundation 
of 
the 
American 
experience, 
plays such as “Hamilton” help 
reinforce and justify those beliefs. 
To those that believe in stronger 
border protection and cultural 
conservatism, other forms of art 
exist to reinforce and justify these 
beliefs.
While it is too early to note 
the effects of this phenomenon, 
changes will undoubtedly occur 
as these subcultures become 
more defined. The internet allows 
for plays such as “Hamilton” to 
cleave through the very fabric of 
American culture, bringing the 
very sustainability of this fabric 
into question.
This is not to say that performing 
arts have only recently become 
polarizing. “Hamilton” isn’t the 

first instance of a play developing 
any political connotations — the 
perpetual re-interpretations of 
Shakespeare are among the best 
examples of the constant political 
meanings to be found in the 
performing arts. It is important, 
however, to note the false or 
misleading 
cultural 
narratives 
that can become grounded in 
these works of art. We must be 
careful not to ingratiate ourselves 
in the common narratives of 
our respective subcultures. As 
Poincaré said, “to doubt everything 
or to believe everything are two 
equally convenient solutions; both 
dispense with the necessity of 
reflection.” As we continue into 
an increasingly interconnected 
future, we must be conscious 
of this tendency induced by our 
interconnectedness. 
We 
must 
continue to doubt widespread 
cultural narratives even as we 
must eventually accept certain 
cultural truths.
We must also note the power 
of ground-breaking works of 
art to overcome the barriers 
between 
these 
subcultures. 
Though “Hamilton” seems to 
be a decidedly liberal play, this 
did not prevent Dick Cheney 
from 
publicly 
expressing 
his 
admiration for it. While some 
might argue that Cheney is not the 
specific type of nationalist or anti-
immigrant conservative that one 
would expect to oppose this work, 
his public support for it defies 
almost any other explanation. He 
simply enjoyed the work. Though 
these subcultures are developing 
at rapid speeds, it seems their 
divides can still be traversed.
Regardless of the unifying or 
polarizing nature of these works, 
it is important to note the aspects 
of history that we gloss over as 
we develop these interpretations 
and 
understandings 
of 
art. 
What is lost, we must ask, in this 
interpretation of the work? What 
is being prioritized and what 
minimized? We cannot question 
everything, but that does not 
mean we should question nothing. 
We must instead be aware of the 
clemency we take in developing 
these interpretations and the 
inevitable aspects of history lost 
along the way.

In Northwestern, Michigan also faces history

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team’s fate was set 
in stone with four games left 
in the 2016-17 season. At 21-5 
with a 10-2 Big Ten record, the 
Wolverines were set to return to 
the NCAA Tournament for the 
first time since 2013. Anything 
less 
than 
collapse 
would 

guarantee as much.

Michigan collapsed.
The 

Wolverines 
dropped 
three 

of their last four 
games 
in 
the 

regular 
season, 

then 
quietly 

bowed 
out 
of 

the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament with 
a loss to Michigan 
State. They were 
left out of the 
NCAA Tournament to their own 
surprise — a decision coach Kim 
Barnes Arico recently referred 
to as a robbery — but Michigan 
brought that fate unto itself.

This season, there should 

be no such ambiguity heading 
into 
Selection 
Sunday. 
The 

Wolverines were ranked as high 
as 13th in the AP poll last week 
with a not-insignificant chance 
to win the Big Ten’s regular 
season title. They were cruising 
to a 20-point win over Purdue on 
Thursday that would have put 
their record at 20-4 and further 
solidified a tournament bid.

Then the Boilermakers scored 

the last 16 points of regulation 
to tie it, going on to eke out 
an overtime win. Michigan 
followed that up with a loss 

at Rutgers on 
Sunday. 
Now, 

with 
four 

games 
to 
go, 

the 21st-ranked 
Wolverines are 
19-6, with an 
8-4 conference 
record 
— 
an 

uncomfortably 
familiar 
position for a 
program 
well-

acquainted with heartbreak.

“(The Purdue game) was 

probably the first time all year 
where we kind of looked a little 
scared,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
told 

WTKA on Tuesday. “And (we) 
looked different than we had 
prior to any other games during 

the year. Almost ... afraid to 
lose.”

Thursday’s contest against 

Northwestern 
will 
be 
a 

watershed moment for this team. 
It’s a game Michigan should 
win — the Wolverines beat the 
Wildcats 80-59 at Evanston 
Township High School just over 
10 days ago. Northwestern sits 
near the bottom of the Big Ten 
with a 2-8 conference record and 
has a negative scoring margin. 

In the first meeting between 

the 
two, 
senior 

guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty 
and 

junior 
center 

Hallie 
Thome 

combined for 52 
points, 
nearly 

outscoring 
the 

Wildcats 
all 

by 
themselves 

and 
handily 

outdueling 
Abi 
Scheid 

and 
Lindsey 
Pulliam, 
their 

two leading scorers. Though 
Northwestern’s 
leading 

rebounder, 
Pallas 
Kunaiyi-

Akpanah, put up a double-
double, Michigan outrebounded 
the Wildcats by 11. Moreover, 
the Wolverines pulled down 47 

percent of offensive rebounds — 
above their 42.4-percent season 
average. The result was never in 
doubt.

On paper, this game is not 

close either. Northwestern hasn’t 
magicked itself into a good team 
in the past two weeks, losing 
its only game since playing 
Michigan. Playing on the road 
is tougher than playing at home. 
The Wolverines beat the Wildcats 
by 21 in Evanston. It’s not hard 
to do the math and figure out 

Michigan 
is 

the favorite on 
Thursday.

And yet, last 

season looms. 
Though 
the 

Wolverines 
have 
been 

fairly 
secure 

in a potential 
bid throughout 
the year, their 
record is worse 

than it was at this time in 2017. 
That’s in part due to two losses 
against top-three teams early in 
the season, but a similar end to 
the season may bring a similar 
fate nonetheless.

“We learned after the Purdue 

game when we were up big, we 
can never relax,” Barnes Arico 
said. “You can never take your 
foot off the gas. You have to 
play for the entire 40 minutes 
and anybody in our league — I 
mean, Northwestern’s coming 
off a tough loss at Indiana in 
overtime. So they’re a team 
that’s 
playing 
well, 
that’s 

desperate for a win. So everyone 
is gonna come in here looking to 
knock us off.”

This is as close to a must-win 

game as Michigan has had all 
year. The margin for error has 
evaporated in the last week — 
it’s now or never.

“It’s important for us to just 

remain positive, take a deep 
breath, it’s gonna be ok,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Let’s get back to 
work, let’s get back to the grind, 
and let’s figure out how to get 
better because there’s a lot of 
season left to be played.”

‘M’ preparing for first 
tournament of season

Last season, the Michigan 

softball team failed to advance 
past regionals for only the second 
time since 2004.

This Friday, the 18th-ranked 

Wolverines kick off their 2018 
campaign in Tampa Bay, Fla., 
as they compete in the USF 
Wilson-Demarini Tournament. 
Michigan will open up the 
five-game tournament against 
Alabama-Birmingham. However, 
the toughest contest of the 
weekend will take place Saturday, 
as the Wolverines will square off 
against No. 2 Florida.

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins is unfazed by the high 
level of competition early in the 
season.

“It 
doesn’t 
matter 
who 

you’re playing,” Hutchins said. 
“I don’t focus on who we’re 
playing because we just need to 
play every game with the same 
approach. We worry about what 
we do. We control what we can 
control which is our effort and 
attitude.”

As Hutchins begins her 34th 

year at the helm, the Wolverines 
look to rebound off of an 
abnormal 2017 season which saw 
Michigan fall to the Washington 
Huskies in the Seattle Regional 
championship game.

It will be no easy task, as the 

team lost a slew of graduating 
seniors — all of whom were 
four-year starters. The chain of 
leadership continues, however, as 
the next group of upperclassmen 
steps forward to guide the 
team in its quest to erase the 
disappointment of last season.

If the Wolverines hope to 

return to the level of success to 
which the program has become 
accustomed, the team will need 
contributions from all of its 
players. 
Michigan’s 
incoming 

freshman class includes a cluster 
of highly-touted prospects. Left-
hander Meghan Beaubien and 
utility player Lou Allan — the 
No. 6 and No. 8 overall prospects, 

respectively, 
according 
to 

FloSoftball — headline the list of 
newcomers. The development of 
its young players is essential, and 
it begins with the leadership of 
the more experienced players on 
the squad.

“Leadership is not just about 

doing things yourself and leading 
by example,” Hutchins said. “I 
always say it’s your job to show 
up and work hard and be great 
… And so, what do you need? You 
need upperclassmen to say it’s 
okay, I went through this too, you 
can do it.”

Michigan is returning 16 

letterwinners and five starters, 
led by senior first baseman and 
right-hander Tera Blanco and 
junior second baseman Faith 
Canfield — both of whom earned 
NFCA All-American and All-
Big Ten first team honors last 
season.

Last season’s early postseason 

exit puts the Wolverines in a 
different position to start the 
season than in previous years. 
Despite this being unfamiliar 
territory, 
Michigan 
doesn’t 

necessarily view it as a bad thing.

“There’s not a target on our 

back like I think there has been 
in the past,” Canfield said. “And 
I think that’s a good thing, cause 
we’re just going to go out there 
and go for it … I think (because 
we lost four starters) people have 
kind of just written us off a little 
bit.”

At 18th, the Wolverines are 

beginning 
the 
season 
with 

their lowest preseason ranking 
throughout the tenure of all of 
their current players. Perhaps a 
chip on their shoulder is exactly 
what this team needs to light a 
fire beneath them and propel 
them towards what they hope 
will be a return to the winning 
culture of Michigan softball.

“We re-established culture,” 

said senior utility player Aidan 
Falk. “We took a step back, and 
we really figured out what the 
pillars of Michigan softball are 
and what’s really important to 
our team.”

“Everyone is 
gonna come in 
here looking to 
knock us off.”

The Wolverines are again in danger of missing out on the NCAA Tournament

“It’s important 

for us to 

just remain 
positive.”

SOFTBALL

Becker blossoming into offensive force

Jack Becker’s first collegiate 

goal, to put it generously, needed 
just a tiny bit of good fortune.

With 
Michigan 
trailing 

Bowling Green, 5-3, in the Great 
Lakes Invitational on Jan. 1, 
Becker launched a speculative 
shot about 90 feet from the 
net. Falcons goaltender Ryan 
Bednard saw it mid-flight and 
easily caught it over his right 
shoulder. Then, somehow, the 
puck squirted out of his grasp, 
falling behind him and across 
the plane of the goal.

That splash of luck aside, 

Becker’s rise over the past five 
weeks has been anything but a 
fluke. Since the calendar turned 
to 2018, the freshman forward 
from 
Dellwood, 
Minn. 
has 

scored six goals and recorded 
eight points in 11 games, putting 
him fourth among all Wolverines 
during that timespan.

“He’s probably grown more 

than anybody on our team,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“Just his level of skating, his 
shot, his passing, everything.”

Despite 
only 
being 
a 

freshman, Becker may have 
more 
history 
with 
Pearson 

than any of his teammates. In 
2016, he committed to Michigan 
Tech to play for Pearson — then 
the Huskies’ head coach. But 
last April, Pearson took the 
Wolverines’ head coaching job 
after six seasons in Houghton. 
Becker followed him to Ann 
Arbor a month later, becoming 
Pearson’s first commitment at 
Michigan.

However, this shared history 

goes back even farther. As an 
assistant coach at Michigan 
Tech in the early 1980s, Pearson 
recruited “a big kid out of 
the iron range of northern 
Minnesota” 
to 
bolster 
the 

Huskies’ 
defenseman 
corps. 

That kid? None other than 
Becker’s 
father, 
Russ, 
who 

would go on to play 82 games for 
the Huskies from 1984 to 1988.

“(Russ was) nowhere near 

the player Jack is, so you can 
tell him I said that,” Pearson 
quipped, before extolling the 
elder Becker’s virtues on a 
serious note. “Strong character 
person, 
worked 
hard. 
Had 

limited abilities, but he brought 
it every day.”

Thirty years later, Pearson 

observes many of those same 
attributes in Russ’ son, who 
he describes as the “hardest 
worker” on his team. Both 
Beckers 
are 
indeed 
big 
— 

Jack’s 
listed 
measurements 

of 6-foot-3 and 205 pounds 
match 
his 
father’s 
during 

his time at Michigan Tech. 
Currently, Pearson noted, Russ 
is a successful Minneapolis 
businessman 
in 
charge 
of 

several construction companies, 
and in a similar vein, Pearson 
described Jack as a “guy you’d 
hire.”

“It’s the intangibles,” Pearson 

said. “Anybody can walk into a 
rink and see if a guy can skate 
or handle the puck or plays 
physical, but it’s the intangibles, 
all those things that you can’t 
measure in a person that really 
made Russ who he is, and his 
son has all those traits.”

According to Pearson, one of 

those traits is Jack’s extreme 
responsiveness 
to 
coaching, 

which Pearson believes is one of 
the most important reasons why 
he has developed to the extent 
that he has this season.

“Everything, just he’s really 

improved on. And that’s not 
by 
accident,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“He’s like a sponge, he takes 
everything in, he takes it to 
heart, 
he’s 
very 
coachable. 

Coachability in this day and age 
is so important. Just being able 
to accept what the coaches are 
telling you and trying to put it in 

your game, and some players are 
more coachable than others.

“And he’s a coach’s dream. 

‘Yes sir,’ and ‘what do I need to 
do to get better?’ But he’s that 
type of person, he’s been raised 
that way.”

Last weekend’s series against 

Wisconsin was a reflection of 
how far Becker has come since 
October. While his two goals 
against Penn State two weeks 
earlier came as a product of 
pure size and strength in the 
crease, Becker was a dangerous, 
all-around offensive anchor of 
Michigan’s third and fourth 
lines against the Badgers.

On the Wolverines’ third 

goal Friday, Becker smoothly 
reeled in a stretch pass from 
Jake Slaker and cut right down 
the wing, hitting the sophomore 
forward with a pinpoint return 
pass and centering him for a 
close-range finish. On their 

fourth goal, Becker jumped on 
the puck behind the Wisconsin 
net and took Badger defenseman 
Matthew Freytag out of the play 
with a nifty fake pass while 
skating back around into the 
slot, finishing with a snipe 
past goaltender Jack Berry. For 
good measure, Becker assisted 
on freshman forward Dakota 
Raabe’s empty-net clincher and 
added a crucial power play goal 
Saturday.

“I think maybe it’s just been 

more gradual, the chemistry 
with our line and just playing 
better,” Becker said. “... Pucks 
have been going in lately, but 
I think that every game I’ve 
gotten better and our line’s 
gotten better.”

Added 
freshman 
forward 

Michael 
Pastujov, 
Becker’s 

linemate as well as roommate: 
“He brings a lot of physicality 
and battling in the corners. He 

helps get the puck, and he’s also 
a really good finisher and he can 
make plays.”

It’s easy to see why Becker, 

despite being a seventh-round 
draft pick of the Boston Bruins 
in 2015, might have originally 
been overshadowed among the 
Wolverines’ class of freshman. 
Forwards Pastujov and Josh 
Norris as well as defenseman 
Quinn Hughes all played for 
the prestigious United States 
National 
Development 
Team 

Program. Norris was selected 
17th overall by the San Jose 
Sharks in last June’s NHL Draft, 
and Hughes appears likely to be 
picked even higher this summer. 
Even Raabe was singled out 
before the season by Pearson for 
his speed and skill.

Becker, 
meanwhile, 
didn’t 

arrive in Ann Arbor with a 
similar pedigree. His age — he 
turns 21 in June — doesn’t hint 
at a wealth of upside a la Norris 
or Hughes. His numbers from 
junior hockey don’t jump off 
the page — a respectable, but 
not mind-blowing 28 points in 
49 games with the Sioux Falls 
Stampede of the USHL last 
season. And Becker himself 
recognizes that he has room to 
grow as a player.

“Just moving your feet and 

the speed in the first three 
steps are so huge,” Becker said. 
“That’s something I just need to 
continue to work on, definitely 
a work in progress. It’s getting 
better, but need to keep working 
on it.”

And if he does keep doing just 

that? If he keeps improving at 
the pace he is now?

“We had an NHL team come 

in and tell me they think he’s 
our best pro prospect,” Pearson 
said. “We’ve got Quinn Hughes 
and Josh Norris, and a lot of guys 
who I think are going to play at 
the next level. For someone to 
come in and say that about Jack, 
I think is a testament to where 
he’s headed and the future that 
he has if he continues to grow 
and get better.”

Offensive struggles becoming a troubling trend for the Wolverines

It seems like years ago that 

a 
scorched-earth 
offensive 

juggernaut went shot for shot 
with Purdue on its home court. 

That night, the Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
team 
shot 

60 percent from the field, 56 
percent from 3-point range and 
scored 1.35 points per possession 
against the No. 3 team in the 
country. It became the first team 
all season to score 1.3 points per 
possession in a game and lose. 
Senior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
was 
hitting 

fadeaway threes and sweeping 
layups en route to a 26-point 
outburst — causing coach John 
Beilein to insinuate a Derrick 
Walton-esque leap could be in 
store.

Offensive 
turbulence 

appeared to be a thing of the 
past.

It 
seems 
like 
years 
ago, 

because the two weeks before 
and the two weeks since have 
featured 
offensive 
struggles 

the likes of which Michigan 
has rarely experienced under 
Beilein.

Putting the flame-throwing 

showcase at Mackey Arena aside, 
the Wolverines have averaged 61 
points per game on 41-percent 
shooting in the other six games, 
and done so with a consistently 
troubling malaise.

“I just think 

we need to have 
a little bit more 
of 
a 
sense 
of 

urgency,” Abdur-
Rahkman 
said 

after 
Tuesday 

night’s 61-52 loss 
at Northwestern. 
“I think we didn’t 
have that. Also, 
it’s getting late 
in the season … a 
lot of people are adjusting to the 
way people are playing. We’ve 
just got to make adjustments as 
well.”

Each game has its built-

in excuse to sugarcoat the 
struggles. The Maryland game 
came just two days after the 
high point of the season, a road 
victory against Michigan State. 
The Wolverines went to Lincoln 
facing a desperate Nebraska 
team, in a hostile environment, 
in the midst of a grueling stretch 
of four games in nine days — a 
“schedule loss.” Rutgers, for its 

gruesome offensive deficiencies, 
was a strong defensive side that 
came into the game intending to 
muck up offensive flow and slow 
down tempo at all costs.

Northwestern — both times — 

unveiled a unique 
matchup 
zone 

that 
presented 

few 
clear 

solutions.

“I don’t know 

if 
we 
had 
a 

week prep (for 
the 
zone) 
we 

could 
make 
a 

big 
difference,” 

Beilein said. “It is 
really good.”

Added 
Abdur-Rahkman: 

“They knew what we were 
running, things like that — we 
just played them, like a week 
ago. So they’re familiar with our 
players and our scout and stuff 
like that.”

Individually, 
each 

performance 
is 
excusable. 

Together, they paint a troubling 
picture.

But what exactly are those 

adjustments 
Abdur-Rahkman 

alluded to?

For one, starting to make shots 

would help. Though the past 

month has displayed struggles, 
the 
overall 
team 
shooting 

outlook 
(47.1 
percent 
from 

the field and 36 percent from 
three on the season) is about on 
par with other slightly above 
average 
Beilein 

teams. 
There 

is a prevailing 
sentiment 
that 

the 
shooting 

struggles are a 
blip on the radar, 
that a Beilein-
coached 
team 

will 
find 
its 

stroke — and that 
very well may be. 

But 
unlike 

past teams, there are few guys 
on this team who are drastically 
underperforming their expected 
shooting numbers.

Abdur-Rahkman is currently 

matching his career-best 3-point 
percentage (37.8) and taking 
them at a much higher clip. 
Wagner, too, is right around 

his 
career-high 
in 
3-point 

percentage (39.6) and shooting a 
solid 53.7 percent from the field. 

The two main dropoffs come 

from the sharp decline in the 
shooting of fifth-year senior 

forward Duncan 
Robinson, 
who 

has 
somewhat 

inexplicably gone 
from 42 percent 
to 35 percent on 
3-pointers in the 
span of a year. 
The other comes 
from the natural 
dropoff 
from 

an elite scoring 
point guard in 

Derrick Walton Jr. to the more 
defense-focused Zavier Simpson, 
an unavoidable decline. The 
sophomore has made just four of 
his last 21 3-point attempts after 
starting the year 14-for-31.

“Of course, it sucks,” Wagner 

said. “You play basketball to 
make shots, it’s fun to win. You 

practice so much, and missing 
shots is not fun.”

One possible solution may 

be an attempt to re-emphasize 
redshirt 
sophomore 
wing 

Charles Matthews. Matthews 
has scored just 12.3 points on 
43 percent from the field and 
26 percent from three in the 
last seven games. And while 
those numbers don’t jump out 
as overtly destructive, they’re 
discouraging for a guy who had 
begun to evolve into the team’s 
go-to scorer, a role still patiently 
waiting for an apt suitor.

A 
perfomance 
becomes 
a 

problem. A problem becomes a 
trend. A trend becomes a fatal 
flaw. Right now, Michigan is 
ranked 57th in adjusted offensive 
efficiency, 
which 
comes 

dangerously close to the lowest 
ranking of the Beilein era — 67th 
in 2015.

“We’re responsible for (the 

struggles),” Wagner said. “We’ve 
got to make shots, it’s on us.”

Four-star recruit flips commitment to Georgia 
in otherwise uneventful Signing Day for Michigan

The 
Michigan 
football 

program welcomed three new 
signees to the 2018 recruiting 
class on National Signing Day 
on Wednesday, but the biggest 
news came from a player who 
wasn’t on that list.

Four-star 

linebacker 
Otis 

Reese, a former 
Michigan 
verbal 
commit, 

announced 
Wednesday at a 
ceremony at his 
high school that 
he would instead 
be 
playing 
at 

University 
of 

Georgia 
next 

season. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh 
was 
informed 
of 

Reese’s decision earlier in the 
day.

“(I) wouldn’t say it caught 

us off guard,” Harbaugh said. 
“We understood that was a 
possibility. … One person closes 

the door, that opens the door for 
somebody else, and it’s our job 
to make sure that whoever turns 
the knob on that is what’s right 
for Michigan.”

Reese, a native of Leesburg, 

Ga., 
verbally 
committed 
to 

Michigan in June of 2016 and 
was one of the longest-standing 
commitments 
in 
the 
class. 

Ranked 
87th 

overall and 5th 
among 
outside 

linebackers 
nationally 
according 
to 

the 
247Sports 

composite, 
Reese 
represented 
a 

significant loss 
for a recruiting 
class that will 

be viewed as one of the least 
prominent in years. He had 
previously 
been 
Michigan’s 

highest-rated commit.

In 
a 
tamped 
down 

environment, 
devoid 
of 
the 

bright lights and loudspeakers of 
past years, Harbaugh welcomed 

in the new class.

Thanks to the new early 

signing period in late December, 
the day was relatively quiet. 
Nineteen of the 22 commits — 
excluding incoming transfers, 
Shea 
Patterson 
and 
Casey 

Hughes — in the class signed 
their letters of intent in the early 
period, leaving just three to sign 
Wednesday.

“There 
was 

a 
priority 
for 

youngsters to sign 
on the first signing 
day,” 
Harbaugh 

said. “That’s the 
biggest takeaway.”

Ronnie 
Bell, 

a 
three-star 

receiver 
from 

Kansas 
City, 

totaled 
159 

catches and 31 touchdowns in 
his high school career. Until 
December, though, Bell was 
committed to play basketball 
at Missouri State. Bell earned 
the Simone award — granted to 
the best football player in the 
Kansas City area — for his senior 

year production. 

Three-star Michael Barrett 

also signed his letter of intent 
Wednesday, and though it’s 
unclear what position he’ll play 
play, Harbaugh said he was 
eager to get him the ball.

“Envision him getting the ball 

in his hands — wide receiver, slot 
receiver, running back. I think 

those 
two 

areas primarily 
for 
him,” 

Harbaugh said. 
“Somebody 
who can get the 
ball and make 
yards after the 
catch — yards 
after 
contact. 

A receiver who 
can run like a 
running back, 

but I think also he’ll have the 
ability to be a running back.”

Barrett thrived as a dual-

threat 
quarterback 
in 
high 

school, racking up 4,640 yards 
passing, 2,647 yards rushing 
and 83 total touchdowns in 
his career. His senior year, 
Barrett was named Georgia’s 7A 
offensive player of the year. He 
received interest from Georgia 
Tech to play quarterback in its 
triple-option system, ultimately, 
choosing 
Michigan 
rather 

than the assurance of playing 
quarterback elsewhere.

Barrett’s 
recruitment 

continued the coaching staff’s 
recent emphasis on recruiting 
out of the state of Georgia. He 
is the third player in the class 
from Georgia, totaling six such 
recruits in the last three years. 

In 
all, 
the 
class 
ranks 

21st nationally, according to 
247Sports, 
and 
features 
no 

consensus five-star prospects. 
Excluding 
Harbaugh’s 
first, 

shortened 
recruiting 
class, 

this class ranks as the lowest 
Michigan has had since 2011, the 
year between the tenures of Rich 
Rodriguez and Brady Hoke.

Livers hurts left ankle 
in loss to Northwestern

Isaiah Livers stole the ball and 

headed up the court. He rose over 
a Northwestern defender and laid 
it in, putting the No. 20 Michigan 
men’s basketball team up, 4-0, less 
than two minutes into Tuesday’s 
game.

When the freshman forward 

landed, though, he turned his 
left ankle and fell to the floor. He 
got up and attempted to play the 
next defensive possession with 
a heavy limp, but Wildcat guard 
Bryant McIntosh attacked Livers, 
drawing a foul.

Livers hobbled off the court and 

was immediately 
attended to by 
trainers on the 
bench 
before 

going 
to 
the 

locker room. The 
freshman tested 
the ankle after 
halftime 
but 

was 
ultimately 

unable to return.

After 
the 

game, Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein said he thought the injury 
was a left ankle sprain, though he 
admitted he hadn’t spoken with 
the team doctors yet.

“The fact that he wanted to 

go out and try it again means it’s 
probably not a break or anything 
like that,” Beilein said. “But, you 
know, with an ankle sprain, you 
never know.”

Livers 
has 
struggled 

offensively in recent weeks. Since 
he broke into the starting lineup — 
usurping fifth-year senior Duncan 
Robinson — in the Wolverines’ 
Jan. 13 game against Michigan 
State, he has yet to score more 
than eight points in a game.

Livers’ 
points-per-game 

average has slowly dropped to 4.4, 
and while his energetic defense 
has allowed him to maintain 

his starting spot, he hasn’t been 
the same offensive threat as of 
late. So it’s unlikely Livers would 
have been able to jumpstart the 
stagnant Michigan offense in 
Tuesday’s game, though Beilein 
did mention the stress Livers’ 
absence put on the team’s rotation.

“(Livers’ 
injury) 
certainly 

affected us a little bit, but that was 
not the reason we lost,” Beilein 
said. “ … (Against Northwestern’s) 
zone, you know, he didn’t play a 
lot. It certainly would have gave 
Duncan a rest, and I think that 
you can’t, probably, put a measure 
on what that does to Duncan and 
his shooting.”

Robinson played 36 minutes 

Tuesday 
and 

scored just three 
points. 
He 
too 

has 
struggled 

offensively, 
shooting just 35 
percent 
from 

deep — a far cry 
from last season’s 
42-percent clip.

Though 
his 

availability 
for 
Sunday’s 

game 
against 

Wisconsin is still unclear, as 
Beilein mentioned, the fact that 
Livers was able to at least try to 
play on his ankle likely means the 
injury isn’t too serious.

For that, the Wolverines can 

be 
thankful. 
Junior 
forward 

Moritz Wagner mentioned Livers’ 
energy, defense and versatility as 
things Michigan missed with the 
freshman out of the lineup.

If Livers is unable to play in 

the future, it stands to reason 
Robinson will get a hefty share 
of the available minutes. When 
Robinson does need a break, 
Beilein could also play redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 
Charles 

Matthews as the four-man with 
freshman guard Jordan Poole 
and senior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman at the wings.
