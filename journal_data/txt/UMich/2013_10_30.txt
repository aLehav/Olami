This week, the University
began the second phase of Proj-
ect Horizon, an initiative that
aims to improve all programs
administered by Information
and Technology Services by
2015.
ITS employees began evalu-
ating services in April, decid-
ing whether to upgrade them,
support them on a limited basis
or retire them completely.
Throughout January, ITS will
alert users to impending changes
that will be implemented in 2014.
The project is part of Next-
Gen, an initiative that plans to
reduce the costs of ITS for the
University and improve quality

of service by providing modern,
standardized offerings like stor-
age and server infrastructure.
Terry Houser, interim assis-
tant director of Infrastructure
Projects for ITS, said a main goal
of Project Horizon is to reduce
the confusion on campus caused
by redundant ITS products,
moving to, offerings that meet a
standard set of performance and
quality requirements.
'Houser said cutting costs is a
priority "first and foremost," but
could not provide an exact goal
or figure.
"We have services that are, in
many cases, old, and they're in
need of retirement," he said.
Obsolete programs such as
the University's blogging plat-
form, MBlog, will be retired
permanently. Houser offered

Professors save

Popular Mechanics
recognizes faculty
members as 'world-
changing' innovators
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Two University professors are
honored in this month's issue of
Popular Mechanics magazine as
one of the 10 most world-chang-
ing groups of innovators in 2013.
The honor follows the profes-
sors' unprecedented treatment of
a rare type of tracheal collapse:
using a 3D printer to produce a
customized, tailored splint to
correct medical problems. Glenn
Green, associate professor of
pediatric otolaryngology, and
Scott Hollister, professor of bio-
chemical and mechanical engi-
neering and associate professor
' of surgery, produced what may
be the first instance of 3D print-
ing saving a life.
The University got a men-
tion in the list last year for the
MABEL robot, which was built
with the ability to walk more like

humans than most other robots.
Logan Ward, a senior corre-
spondent for Popular Mechanics,
selects the Breakthrough Awards
and said the honored technolo-
gies are not necessarily the
flashiest and most complex of the
year, but are making the biggest
changes in impressive ways.
Ward added that Green and
Hollister are particularly notable
because they applied innovative
technology to save a life.
"As magazine editors, we tell
stories, and this is a dramatic
story with a happy ending," Ward
said.
Green took the honor as an
acknowledgment of his and his
team's effort to help children in
innovative ways.
"They look at this as being a
harbinger of the future," Green
said. "The potential of 3D manu-
facturing to help children and
help everyone is recognized by
them, and they wanted to show-
case the way that 3D printing can
revolutionize medical care."
Green and Holister's invention
helped 2-year-old Kaiba Gion-
friddo, who, at a very early age,
faced great difficulty breathing.

Landfill in Sochi
violates no-waste
promise to deliver
'clean' Olympics
AKHSHTYR, Russia (AP) -
Trucks rumble to the edge of
a gigantic pit filled with spray
cans, tires and foam sheets and
dump a stream of concrete slabs
that send up a cloud of limestone
dust. Other trucks pile clay on top
and a bulldozer mixes everything
together in a rudimentary effort
to hide the mess. This landfill
outside Sochi, which will host
the Winter Olympics in 100 days,
is smack in the middle of a water
protection zone where dumping
industrial waste is banned.
As a centerpiece of its Olympic
bid, Russia trumpeted a "Zero
Waste" program that promised
the cleanest games ever, saying it
would refrain from dumping con-
struction waste and rely on reus-
able materials.
But on a visit last week to Akh-
shtyr, just north of Sochi, The
Associated Press found that Rus-
sia's state-owned rail monopoly
is dumping tons of construction
waste into what authorities call
an illegal landfill, raising con-
cerns of possible contamination
in the water that directly supplies
Sochi.
The finding shows how little
Russia has done to fulfill its ambi-
tious green pledges. Its $51billion
budget for the Olympics contains
no provisions for treating con-
struction waste.
In a letter obtained by the
AP, the 'Environmental Protec-
tion Agency in the area where
Sochi is located told the Black Sea
resort's environment; council in
late August that it had inspected
the Akhshtyr landfill and found
"unauthorized dumping of con-
struction waste as well as soil
from excavation works." The
agency said it fined Russian Rail-
ways, whose Sochi project costs
billions of dollars, $3,000 for
the dumping. It didn't order the

dump closed.
The EPA's Sochi representative
visited the site earlier this month
and insisted it was being cleaned
up, villagers and activists who
were present at that meeting said.
The agency was unavailable for
comment this week.
The main health concern sur-
rounding the landfill is to the
water supply.
Authorities confirm that Rus-
sian Railways operates the Akh-
shtyr dump without a license
- but it wouldn't be able to obtain
one even if it tried.
That's because the village lies
in an area where dumping con-
struction waste and soil is for-
bidden under the Russian Water
Code. Moisture from the landfill
seeps through porous karst rocks
into underground springs that
feed the nearby Mzymta River,
which provides up to half the
water supply in Sochi.
"Water from here will be con-
taminating Sochi's fresh water
springs forthe next10 to15 years,"
said Vladimir Kimaev, a member
of the Environmental Watch on
North Caucasus.
Boris Golubov, a geologist with
the Russian Academy of Sciences,
said it is impossible to accurately
judge the impact of the Akhshtyr
dump without a chemical break-
down of the waste and a full geo-
logical survey of the rocks. He
said, however, that the landfill's
location on karst is potentially
hazardous.
"Whenever you start dumping
something or dig, you've got to
think twice," Golubov said.
Russian Railways is building
the most expensive piece of Sochi
infrastructure, a 48-kilometer
(30-mile) highway and railroad
link between the airport and the
Alpine venues that has already
cost the government 270 billion
rubles ($8.5 billion).
President Vladimir Putin was
in Sochi this week to inaugurate
a train station that serves as a
hub for the link ahead of celebra-
tions Tuesday marking exactly
100 days before the opening cer-
emony.


ays to go
The press office of Russian
Railways' construction unit,
which is responsible for the
road and manages the limestone
quarry-turned-waste dump in
Akhshtyr, told AP that it paid
the $3,000 fine in August. The
company blamed the dumping
on a subcontractor, insisting that
the waste management firm had
"rectified the violations" - even
after being told that AP had seen
trucks dumping concrete and that
the pit was still filled with con-
struction waste.
Outside the crater the size of
three football fields, villagers
complain that trucks continue to
bring in construction waste by
night and soil by day - as they
have been doing for at least three
months.
Russian Railways isn't only
dumping in the pit: Just outside
the quarry's fence, aplotof land it
leases is strewn with broken hel-
mets, plastic tubes, foam sheets
and tires. Residents say they have
been complaining to authorities
aboutthe dumping for months.
"Authorities are telling us that
this quarry is illegal and that
it has been closed, but you can
see that it's still here," said vil-
lage chief Alexander Koropov.
"We don't know what to do. We
would like to petition God, but we
haven't got his address. He's the
only person we haven't petitioned
yet."
To compound Akhshtyr's
problems, the village'swells dried
up as the road project got under-
way, depriving it of its own water
source and forcing it to rely on
weekly deliveries in large cis-
terns. Local officials concede that
wells began to go dry as soon as
construction started, but won't
place blame.
Dmitry Kozak, the deputy
prime minister in charge of the
preparations for the games, has
persistently dismissed claimsthat
Sochi is failing on its green com-
mitments. Speaking to reporters
this year, he admitted "certain
violations," but denied claims
that trash still gets dumped in
illegal landfills.

Horizon aren't used by stu-
dents, with the exception of
faculty HTML web pages.
Houser said professors who
want to keep their personal
websites will have to explore
alternatives, such as maintain
their own sites. He added that
analysis by University IT pro-
fessionals found that it was not
cost-effective for the Univer-
sity to provide such a service.
Rex Holland, vice chair of
the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs, said
he doesn't foresee the discon-
tinuation of HTML Pages as
being a problem for most fac-
ulty.

Six weeks after his birth, his
parents discovered he had trou-
ble eating. Two months later, a
tube was inserted in his trachea
to prevent chest contractions
and other cardiopulmonary
reactions.
The Youngstown, Ohio
resident was born with tra-
cheobronchomalacia, a rare
condition where the windpipe's
tissue is so soft it can collapse
over time. Kaiba's case was
especially severe; a tracheos-
tomy - a tube that's inserted
into a patient's windpipe and
exits outside of the neck - and
other common treatments were
not helping.
Green and Hollister had
already formed a partnership in
experimenting with new solu-
tions .to tracheobronchomala-
cia. A call from a surgeon from
Akron Children's Hospital to
University Hospital provided
the chance to use the experi-
mental device.
The splint that saved Kaiba's
life is about the size of a thimble.
It's made from a biodegradable
material that will dissolve in his
trachea in two years according
to Hassan Nasser, a medical stu-
dent who researches in Green's
lab. The splint gives Kaiba's tra-
cheal tissue additional time to

strengthen; his windpipe will
be strong enough in two yeats
to function when the splint dis-
solves.
"Kids still have the abil-
ity to grow and develop their
own cartilage," Nasser said.
"The splint buys him a couple
years for his own cartilage to
grow."
This support for Kaiba's tra-
chea was lentby the customized
nature of the splint. David Zopf,
a fifth-year otolaryngology resi-
dent in Green's lab, said the use
of 3D printers allows doctors to
custom fit and design a device
like Kaiba's with precision.
"The whole process really
provides a tool that provides a
customized microdevice in a
matter of time that wasn't seen
before," Zopf said.
The production of an indi-
vidual splint itself takes about
a minute, and designing an
individual- tube is similar-
ly straightforward. Nasser
,described how doctors took
a CT scan of Kaiba which
allowed a comprehensive, 3D
view of his chest.
Examining CT scans, which
combine a series of X-rays from
multiple angles, is like analyz-
ing a loaf of bread by looking at
individual slices of bread. This
CT scan revealed the worst
case of tracheobronchomalacia
Green had ever seen.
From a scan, the already cre-

ated blueprint for the splint
design can be customized for
the patient's body on a com-
puter.
Ward said 3D printers are
following the same trajectory
as personal. computers, which
were once only found in indus-
trial and research institutions,
but now can be found in over
75 percent of American house-
holds, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau. In the next 50
years, he said, these machines
will likely be ubiquitous in
American households.
"I think 3D printing has
arrived. It's way more than a
fad," Ward said. "In the not-
so-distant future, people will
download CAD drawings and
print products at home. They
will design their own stuff and
sell it. And more and more peo-
ple like Glenn (Green) and Scott
(Hollister) will use it to do good."
The treatment has not been
disseminated to other tracheo-
bronchomalacia patients. But,
when the time comes for mass
production, a printer can pro-
duce 200 splints in four hours
- approximately 1.2 minutes for
one splint.
"I'm always impressed when
you look at the splint and you
look at what it does," Nasser
said. "It's a fairly simple solu-
tion that's really had a dramatic
impact and could potentially
have more."

ture hall, students would more
frequently be out in the field -
helping the community, working
in labs and even partnering with
artists.
"If 10 years from now we have
students that characterize their
first year as sitting in class, that
just feels like this wasted oppor-
tunity to me," Hilton said.
At the conclusion of the meet-
ing, Hilton announced plans to
implement a task team to further
explore all of the ideas and dis-
cuss how they might be imple-
mented on a University-wide
scale. The team will be composed
of faculty and students selected
from Tuesday's event.
Many students are already
stepping out of the classroom and
into massive open online cours-
es, or MOOCs. From the com-
fort of home, students can enroll
in courses and interact with a
global community learning the
same material. Late last year, the
University partnered with major
MOOC provider Coursera and
currently offers 10 courses. Cur-
rently, students can't take cours-
es for credit, and Hilton said the
University has no plans to offer a
for-credit option any time soon.
Nonetheless, many students
find MOOCs helpful. Steve How-

a will to make a difference in the
city.
"I'd be on jobs at people's
houses and talks would turn
to politics and people would
always say, 'Hey, you know more
about this than anybody; you
should run for city council,' " he
said.
Hayner's top priority is the
city's revenue and budget - he
hopes to enhance funding for
areas such as the fire department
and pension fund while examin-
ing areas that may be overfund-
ed.
Overall, Hayner wants to
improve efficiency of all city
services, eliminating areas of
overlap with other providers.
He said finding ways to increase
community involvement in city
efforts and planning is also
important.
Another relevant issue for
Hayner is "sensible develop-
ment" in the city - namely,
providing sufficient housing
throughout Ann Arbor at reason-
able prices. He said the larger
apartment complexes primar-
ily used by students have in fact
done more harm than good as
prices have yet to decline as
promised.
Similar to mayoral candidate
Stephen Kunselman, currently

graduate student, has already
taken five online classes, two
through the University. Howland
liked that he could rewind and
review complex material that
otherwise would have remained
confusing.
"I'm excited that Michigan
is involved in educating more
people than just the ones taking
degrees through the University,"
tIowland said.
Online media was another
point of emphasis during the
event. Students saw the poten-
tial integration of resources sch
as Khan Academy and YouTube
into curriculum as beneficial for
both struggling and high-achiev-
ing students. Such tools would
bring in alternative perspectives
students are for the most part
unaccustomed to in a formal
classroom.
Websites with large amounts
of traffic, like Facebook, were
proposed as an untapped gold
mine that could be adapted for
educational purposes. Hanona
said professors could easily cre-
ate a group for each of their
classes and post provocative
questions, links and related class
material that would pop up on
students' Facebook News Feeds.
"You're learning even when
you don't want to learn," Hanona
said. "But it's a nice thing because
you're always exposed to things
you're eventually going to need
to know."
the Democratic council mem-
ber for Ward 3, Hayner supports
imposing a strict ethics policy for
elected officials to eliminate con-
flicts of interest and avoid ques-
tionable appointments.
"We're just starting to get
a mix of interests, I guess you
could say, between the public
and the people on city council
that they're actually starting to
debate these appointments say-
ing, 'Is this the best person for
the job?' he said.
With regards to Ann Arbor's
relations with the Univer-
sity, Hayner would like to: see
improved communication
between the two institutions,
especially concerning new con-
struction.
Council members have
expressed concern that the
University's persistent pur-
chasing of land is robbing the
city's tax roles. Hayner said he
wants to explore implementing
the Payment in Lieu of Taxes
program, where the city would
collect payment from lands that
are otherwise tax exempt such
as federal lands or nonprofit
organizations like the Univer-
sity.
"We're all living here togeth-
er," Hayner said. "Students are
here; we're all here together, so
you don't have to enter into it and
it's not something we're saying,
'We demand this or that.' It's just
a conversation."

Criminal's attacks
leave five dead
including mother
TERRELL, Texas (AP) -
Fear and confusion gripped a
rural North Texas community
for several hours until an ear-
ly-morning arrest Tuesday, as
investigators sought desperate-
ly to stop a series of attacks that
left five people dead, including
the suspect's mother.
Charles Everett Brownlow
Jr. was arrested at about 1:30
a.m. Tuesday after running
into the woods following a
high-speed chase, authorities
said. Terrell police Chief Jody
Lay said he thinks Brownlow
might have attacked others
if an off-duty officer hadn't
spotted his car.
Brownlow, 36, was being
held on one preliminary
count each of capital mur-
der and evading arrest,
although additional charges
were expected. Prosecutors
referred calls to the police
in Terrell, which is about 30
miles east of Dallas.
"We're all in astateofshock,"
Lay said at a news conference
hours after Brownlow's arrest.
"You have a tendency to think,

'How can that happen here?'
This is a country community,
a rural community, people are
real close. This is going to be,
it's going to have a really big
impact on us."
Lay declined to discuss a
possible motive. He identi-
fied the victims as Brownlow's
mother, Mary Brownlow, 61;
his aunt, Belinda Walker, 55;
Jason Michael Wooden, 33;
Kelleye Lynnette Sluder, 30;
and Luis Gerardo Leal-Carril-
lo, 22. Lay~said that Brownlow
"hung out occasionally" with
Wooden and Sluder. It wasn't
immediately clear whether he
knew Leal-Carrillo.
Brownlow's brother, Ter-
rence Walker, said Brownlow
struggled with drug addiction
and "always wanted to take
something that wasn't his."
He said Brownlow had been
living at their mother's home
and that she continued to look
after him.
"I was hoping my mom
would open her eyes and real-
ize that she needed to let him
grow up, put him out," said
Walker. He said his own fam-
ily spent the night at a hotel
instead of their home in For-
ney, and that he was armed
with a pistol in case his brother
came after him.

Brownlow's criminal record
dates back to 1995 and includes
convictions for drug posses-
sion, burglary and assault-
ing a family member in 2011.
Records indicate Brownlow
was accused of striking a
woman he had a relationship
with. In 2009, he was sen-
tenced to three years in prison
for being a felon in possession
of a firearm, and was paroled
after seven months.
The attacks began around
5 p.m. at the home of Belinda
and Robert Walker. He said
he arrived home to find his
wife lying on the floor of his
15-year-old son's room.
"I just went in calling my
wife's name and she never
did answer," Robert Walker
said.
About 30 minutes later, fire
units responded to a blaze at
Mary Brownlow's house a few
blocks away. When the fire was
extinguished, crews found her
body in the smoldering wreck-
age. Lay said it was clearly
arson.
At about 10:30 p.m., police
responded to a report of a
shooting at another home and
found Wooden and Sluder
dead. A 3-year-old boy in the
home was unharmed and was
released to relatives.

Show me the money
Ads with anonymous donors are problematic in elections
More money was spent in Michigan's 2012 non-partisan Supreme
Court campaign than in any other in the state's history - and
never before has so much of that money come from anonymous
donors. According to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice, $19,mil-
lion was spent on the campaign in total, and $13 million - with no names
attached - went to advertisements that were clearly intended to influence
voters' choices in the election. Under the current interpretation of Michi-
gan's campaign finance law the organizations running these "issue ads"
are not required to reveal their backers. However, this interpretation
leaves too much room for secret spending, and a stricter understanding
of what qualifies as campaign spending is needed in order to prevent this
type of electioneering in the future.

The Michigan Secretary of State's current
interpretation of the Michigan Campaign
Finance Act dates back to 2004 and establishes
that "issue advocacy advertisements" are not
"expenditures." This means that as long as an
ad doesn't use words that specifically advo-
cate for or against a certain candidate, such as
"elect" or "vote," their buyers have the option
to remain anonymous. However, the kinds of
advertisements that ran during the 2012 elec-
tion clearly don't meet any reasonable defini-
tion of an "issue ad." While these kinds of ads
maybe legal and even typical for political cam-
paigns, they, too, pass off support of individual
candidates as mere issue advocacy. Many of the
ads use time-honored techniques such as using
highly emotionalized, out-of-context refer-
ences to candidates' pasts in order to imply
that they should not be elected or assert that
a candidate should be elected because they
support families. While relevant to the elec-
tion to some degree, these qualities are far
less important than an understanding of the
law and impartiality, for example.
The exemption that issue ad buyers have
from disclosing their identities is of greater
concern than the ads themselves. While anony-
mous campaign contributions are problematic

in any kind of election, they're especially dan-
gerous for judicial branch elections. Even more
so than the legislative and executive branches,
the judicial branch mustbe as non-partisan and
removed from the political game as possible.
Conducting judicial elections with the same
secret money present in legislative and execu-
tive elections blinds Michigan voters to the
people who poured money into these ads.
The legitimacy of Michigan's Supreme Court
is also at risk under the current rules. Even
though the Court's judges may not know who
paid for the ads supporting them, it's still prob-
lematic. And to make matters worse, Michigan
now has the dubious distinction ofthaving more
secret campaign spending than any other state
as a result of the loophole. Moreover, more than
twice as much money was spent this way than
was spent by individual candidates, parties and
interest groups on campaigning efforts where
their involvement was mace obvious by report-
ing requirements or other disclosure laws.
Money from undisclosed sources and judi-
cial elections is a dangerous combination. A
review of the MCFA's issue ad provision would
present the state with an opportunity to close
this loophole and create greater integrity in
these elections.

'Are you

These are a
few of the first
questions I '
answered when
I filled out my EMILY
OKCupid profile PITTINOS
in August.
I told friends,
and myself, that I set up my OKCu-
pid for the sake of entertaining jour-
nalism. I said it'd be fun to write
about in my column. And that was
true, but there was also more to it
than that; I wanted to give online
dating a shot.
It's not that I was having trouble
getting dates at the time. In fact,
as noted by my friends, my sum-
mer was shaping up like a roman-
tic comedy. I was getting asked out
by strangers in bookstores, coffee
shops and while out to dinner with
my roommates' families. I was kiss-
ing the boy next door while simulta-
neously schtiiping the punk rocker
who had dreams of writing fiction
in Nashville. In other words, I was
.ankle-deep in trysts.
But I was at a point where, after a
hiatus from relationships, I wanted
more than flirtation and tipsy kiss-
es on the way home from the bar. I
wanted someone with a great brain
and an artistic sensibility, who had a
high capacity for empathy and could
spend hours discussing poetry and
gender and love itself - you know,
the usual. However, that person was
not readily available to me and, like
many lonely people, I considered the
Internet as a viable short cut to love.
The site consumed me almost
immediately. I sat in my living room
for hours on a Friday night, answer-
ing multiple choice and short answer
questions about my worst fears, fan-
tasies, ambitions and opinions on
God. It was like a cross between a

RIMA FADALLAH '
Please don't e(race) me

"No person shall store solid waste or solid
waste containers on property except at locations
as permitted by this chapter or regulations imple-
menting this chapter."
This is the section of the City Code of Ann
Arbor my house was cited under Oct. 5 dur-
ing the football game against Minnesota. My
housemates and I hosted a party on the front
lawn and about 50 cups had been left on our
porch and scattered around the lawn when we
all left to go to the football game. Those cups
remained there until city employees cleaned
them up completely by the time we returned.
In 2002, Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje and
the CityCouncilenacted thisordinance, among
others, under the Clean Community Program.
They were intended to keep "unsightly debris
and buildup of trash off the lawns," according
to former councilman Michael Reid in 2005.
Trash had become an issue in the Ann Arbor
area near the University's campus - student
housing - and the city council was determined
to do something about it. Fines in associa-
tion with infractions of theseordinances have
incrementally increased over time, reaching
$250 for the first offense, $500 for the second
offense and anywhere from $500 to $1,000 for
every subsequent offense.
The ordinances were put into place because
the trash that had began to accumulate on the
lawns of houses was detrimental to the image
of the city and University and was potentially
damaging property values in the area. It's
true that trash remaining on the front lawn of
a house for days or weeks on end might very
well damage the image of the city as a whole,
but property values in areas where the houses
are almost entirely student rentals isn't really a
huge issue. The rental companies that own the
houses aren't really worried about the resale
value of the property, as students will rent the
houses regardless - not buy them - and these
companies are going to hold onto their proper-
ties for a long time.
The lawmakers in Ann Arbor have denied
that these ordinances are targeting students,
but the vast majority of citations - 196 of the

261- in the year 2007 were issued during foot-
ball season, from September through Novem-
ber. In the hearing my roommates and I had,
the community standards officer that issued
the citation said that she was tol d to go around
during the football game on Oct. 5 and issue
citations - conveniently when the majority of
the students will be at the game and not be able
to either clean the property or speak with the
issuing officer.
While I agree that littering tickets should be
issued when waste is left on lawns or property
for extended periods of time, being tasked with
going out during the football games and seek-
ing out offenders causes citations to be dispro-
portionately issued to students. The magistrate
dealing with my ticket said that there was no
timeframe for the littering ordinance, meaning
the ticket can be issued no matter how short of a
time the trash has been on the property.
The students and the University itself bring
Ann Arbor a huge amount of economic activ-
ity. If this ordinance is centered on increasing
revenue for the city, they shouldn't attempt to
get that revenue from students. Students sup-
port a huge amount of the business around
the University - be it at local stores or by
renting properties around the campus -
which in turn gives the city money. The city
exists at its current state because of the Uni-
versity and can get revenue from other sourc-
es. Ann Arbor has lower property taxes than
Detroit and, should they need revenue, could
raise those property taxes. Attempting to get
revenue from students, who most likely don't
have excess funds, is wrong.
The ordinance could have been dealt with
in other ways. For example, the city could
have started this process with a warning sys-
tem for houses that aren't repeat offenders of
the ordinance, telling the residents to clean
their property within 24 hours or otherwise
receive a citation. The city should respect the
students of the University and not specifically
target them with punitive legislation.

If I were a chameleon, many
people may think that I have hor-
rible survival techniques due to
my inability to blend in with my
surroundings. But they're wrong.
What they misunderstand is that
chameleons don't actually change
color to remain inconspicuous -
they change color to communicate.
What many misunderstand
about me is that I, too, am not trying
to hide from anything or anyone.
All my life, the identities that
I consider most salient are the
same ones that make me differ-
ent from everyone around me. I
am a Lebanese-American woman
who, despite being a dual citizen,
has never really felt that I teetered
toward one end of the hyphen.
So I sit here, like the surprisingly
effective chameleon that I am, and
change colors depending on where I
am and who is around me. I change
colors to communicate, to be seen,
and to be heard for who I am.
I change colors because I can. I
change colors because I get to deter-
mine what it means to be me.
After three years ofbeing defined
by others at this University, I've
learned to claim ownership of my
identities - both marginalized and
privileged. In Lebanon, I proudly
represent America, and at the Uni-
versity, I proudly represent my
Lebanese heritage. I've accepted
that no number of hyphens will be
all-encompassing of the complex-
ity that is me. I've come to realize
that, while labels can be dehuman-
izing and dismissive at times, they
allow for some degree of visibility
and recognition.
So don't you dare obliterate what
I have so proudly cultivated.
Too often at this university I hear
ignorant comments such as, "Race is
not biologically a thing; it's a social
construct; therefore, race doesn't

matter," and "I think diversity educa-
tion is unnecessary; I don't under-
stand how it's supposed to enhance
my experience here." If you think
these things, I'm talking to you.
Perhaps you don't get it because
you're blinded by your white gaze.
Let's take a look through my
eyes, shall we? Of the plethora of
issues embedded in your ignorant
statements, I will emphasize two
main points:
First, in saying, "race doesn't
matter," you're essentially denounc-
ing my very existence as a person
of color. You're dismissing my emo-
tions, my experiences and my choic-
es that are often attributed to this
identity that is apparently invisible
to you. But forget about me - do you
seriously believe that the experience
of a Black, Latino, Arab or Native
American is no different than that
of a white American? Race matters.
There are books on that very subject
- enlighten yourself.
And second, when you deem
diversity education "unnecessary,"
you're pretty much ridiculing our
history and experiences as people
of color. I'm sure I'm not alone in
saying diversity education has been
everything to me. It has been my
frustration, my validation and my
empowerment as a woman of color
navigating an overwhelmingly
white institution. Just a general tip
to be a more worldly person: Issues
and affairs shouldn't have to affect
you directly for you to have an
interest in learning about them. Be
inquisitive. Be empathetic.
Because counterarguments to
"controversial" topics such as race
and ethnicity have become so pain-
fully predictable, I'll be proactive and
try to address them here.
Your angry tone is not conducive to
effective dialogue. That's fine by me
because, one, this is not a dialogue,

and two, anger is an emotion to
which I am entitled when faced with
bigoted, racist or sexist remarks.
Don't get me wrong - there is cer-
tainly a time and place for every-
thing; I have engaged in my fair share
of productive dialogues over the past
few years. But at this very time and
place, this chameleon just wants to
be seen - riled or not.
Too often in our diversity or social
justice conversations we are afraid of
making the privileged feel uncom-
fortable. Those who are excluded
from the dominant narrative are
arguably always uncomfortable. Your
comfort is not more important than
mine - especially when it's myiden-
tity that is at stake.
Or to those who say, "I don't see
race! I'm honestly color-blind!" No
you're not; stop lying.
I don't want you to be color-blind.
Colorblindness is a fallacy that
far too many people try hard to
believe because it sounds politically
correct. Much like my cold-blooded
counterparts, I don't want to blend
in. I don't want to assimilate, and
I despise the bigoted implications
of a "big melting pot." I want to be
seen for who Iam. I want myunique
voice toAbe heard. My olive skin is
very much a part of me - more than
ever amongst the sea of white at
Michigan - and I'm proud of it.
What I'm saying is that I'm try-
ing to communicate, so please stop
pretending that I'm not here.
Instead, recognize, respect and
embrace the different individuals
around you for who they are. If you
don't already, ask questions. Take a
step out of your comfort zone and
engage in random conversations
with people who don't look like
you. Who knows, you just may-learn
something about yourself.

because of the greatness that
continually pokes through the

be Arcade Fire's most popular
work, but it feels destined to be a
cult classic, an album treasured

Why you should watch TV

Since the dawn of time, mothers

Chance at
revenge
against
Akron
By MINH DOAN
Daily Sports Writer
A little less than a year ago,
the Michigan men's soccer team
walked off the field, heads down,
as the team across the field cel-
ebrated its NCAA second-round
victory that ended the Wolver-
ines' season. That team across the
field was Akron, and Michigan
will get the chance to avenge that
loss at home Wednesday night
and continue the budding rivalry
between the two schools.
"(The loss) is always on my
mind," said senior defender Eze-
kiel Harris. "Throughout the
years, it's always been Akron
that's been our
biggest enemy" Akron at

gained important points in the
Big Ten race, moving into second
place in the standings.
The Wolverines will look to get
a win against a perennial power-
house, extending a tough rivalry
between them and the Zips. The
two teams have played each other
every season since 2003 and have
met in the postseason three times
within that span. While Akron
got the better of the Wolverines
twice last season - once in the
regular season and once in the
postseason - Michigan upset the
fourth-ranked Zips in a thrilling
overtime game two years ago. The

Senior defender Ezekiel Harris said Akron had been Michigan's "biggest enemy."

nals three years ago, with Akron
coming out on top, 2-1.
"There's always a lot of banter
going back and forth in the games
against Akron because everyone
wants to win the game," Harris
said. "Whenever we play (Akron),
there are at least a couple yellow
cards and a few red cards too."
But this Zips team isvery differ-
ent from the one that ended Mich-
igan's season last year. Akron lost
six starters from last year's team
including all four All-Americans
to professional leagues. The Zips
also lost their coach, Caleb Porter,
to the Portland Timbers of Major
League Soccer.
"They still have a lot of good
pieces," said Michigan coach
Chaka Daley. "Maybe the person-
alities are a bit younger, but they
still have the same style of play
and formidable players and staff."
Akron (4-1 Mid-American Con-
ference, 11-4-1), led 'by first-year
coach Jared Embick, has played
very good soccer as of late. The
Zips have rattled off their own
unbeaten streak with five wins
and a tie in their last six games,
beating No. 12 Wake Forest and
tying No. 22 Michigan State along
the way.
Akron's offense is led by All-
MAC first-team forward Rein-
aldo Breines and midfielder Adam
Najem, who lead the team in scor-
ing with four goals apiece. The
Zips offense will look to make
quick passes and win the posses-
sion battle.
"(Akron) always seems to have
very shifty players who are good
one-on-one and very techni-
cally skilled," Harris said. "They
always move the ball really quick-

ly so we can't be caught sleeping
or ball watching."
The Michigan offense has been
playing very impressively. Timely
goals, quick movements off the
ball and high pressure have led to
an increase in goals for the team
that had a tough time putting one
goal in the back of the net early
on in the season. Against Indi-
ana, the game-winning goal came
after high pressure by freshman
defender Rylee Woods led to the
cross and goal by junior midfield-
er TJ VanSlooten.
The Wolverine offense will
need to continue this impressive
offensive play to score on Akron
goalie Fernando Pina, who has a
MAC-leading eight shutouts this
season.
Michigan's hopes for an NCAA
bid have been looking up with the
successful homestand, but it will
need to keep up the play to beat
Akron and solidify its place in the
tournament.
"Akron is what we aspire to be,"
Daley said. "They are ahead of us
in the rankings, and we feel we
need to win this game to deserve a
place in the NCAA Tournament."
Note: The Michigan Athletic
Department is holding a "zero-
waste event" during the soc-
cer game on Wednesday night.
All fan-related waste from the
game will be either recyclable or
compostable. Concessions will
be served in recyclable or com-

When the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team opened last season,
the hope was for then-freshman
guard Caris LeVert to redshirt
and put more muscle on his then-
6-foot-5,170 pound frame.
It wasn't until the Wolverines'
seventh regular-season game -
at Bradley - that LeVert saw the
court for the first time, excluding
the team's exhibition game.
Besides a start against Cen-
tral Michigan, when he played
32 minutes in late December due
to an injury to former Wolverine
Tim Hardaway Jr., LeVert only
had one other game in the regular
season in which he even played
more than 16 minutes.
Then, against Syracuse in
the national semifinals, LeVert
played 21 minutes, scoring eight
points, including two 3-pointers.
For context, LeVert had seven
3-pointers all of last season.
With Hardaway struggling
from the field that game - he shot
4-for-16 from the field - LeVert
played arguably his best game of
the year.
This year, with Hardaway and
Trey Burke gone, and about 25
shots "out there for other people
right now," according to Michi-
gan coach John Beilein, it made
sense that LeVert - now 6-foot-
6, 185 pounds - would be playing
a larger role on the team. After
being the most under-utilized
freshman lastyear, LeVert's class-
mate Glen Robinson III noted he
was looking forward to LeVert
playing more minutes this year.
"As sophomores, we've been
waiting for this moment where
we can get a chance to play
together for a long time," Rob-
inson said. "We've been talking
about this for a year now, and we
just couldn't wait."
Against Concordia on Tuesday,
LeVert looked like a man ready to
take advantage of the moment.
Playing minutes at both the off-
guard and point guard in transi-
tion, LeVert scored 16 points in

nOn'sD7 ELE/Oaily
Sophomore guard Caris LaVert scored lb points in Michigan's 117-44 victary.

Michigan's 117-44 victory.
"He, as you can see, (has) got
a gear that some people don't
have so we want him to do as
much as he can to push the ball
on the court if he gets a rebound,"
Beilein said regarding the dual-
ity of LeVert's play. "And I like
that he's getting bulked up - he
doesn't look bulked up - but for
him, he has put on weight. But if
he can go crash as an off-guard,
you know just take the ball up the
floor, then that really helps us."
Entering the game after about.
3.5 minutes of play, LeVertlooked
more confident on the floor than
he ever did last season. On the
court with freshman point guard
Derrick Walton Jr., LeVert helped
spread the floor with three other
teammates standing at least
6-foot-6 - sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas, redshirt sophomore
forward Max Bielfeldt and sopho-
more forward Glen Robinson III.

. With a height advantage, even
without the Wolverines' two
starting big men, Michigan was
able to play fast and big, creat-
ing chances in the half-court and
transition offenses.
For LeVert, his first scoring
chance came with 13:32 remain-
ing in the half with some nice
ball movement by the Wolver-
ines. With the ball at the top of
key, freshman forward Zak Irvin
found Robinson under the basket.
Though he could have taken a
quick shot underneath the hoop,
he insetad found a wide-open
LeVert in the corner, who nailed
the shot for his first three points
of the game.
For the rest of the first half, as
Michigan pulled away from the
Cardinals, LeVert and the Wol-
verines looked atease.

hands for the first time, LeVert

For the Daily
The women's club hockey team
gets all the perks of playing at
Michigan - home ice at Yost Ice
Arena, world-class coaching,
winged helmets - and now some
of the team's players will have
the opportunity to participate in
international competition.
Junior defenseman Kalli
Bates, graduate student forward
Kristin Griebe, senior forward
Monica Korzon and coach Rob
Blackburn will travel to Tren-
tino, Italy to join Team USA in
the World University Games. The
club players have the opportu-
nity to participate because they
play in the American Collegiate
Hockey Association, which is
where Team USA draws its WUG
players.
"It's always been a goal of mine
to put on a USA uniform," Kor-
zon said. "I've always dreamed
of being on the Olympic team, but
that was pretty lofty. This is the
next best thing."
USA Hockey - the host orga-
nization for the team - had to
cut some of the program's fund-
ing this year, so the coaches had
to use an unorthodox method of
selecting players for the WUG
team. Instead of holding a tryout
as in the past, the coaches had to
scout players in person. Coaches
have seen each of the 17 players
on the roster play in person over
the last year.
The major downside of the
new system was that the coaches
couldn't compare players on the
same scale because they are play-
ing against different talent levels
in each game. In a controlled try-
out, players are competing against
other high-skill-level players,
which is whatthe coaches need to

see before sending players to go
up against the best in the world.
One of the trade-offs for not
allowing checking in women's
hockey is that the game gets
substantially faster. This is even
more the case in the WUG where
games are played on Olympic-
sized ice, which is 15 feet wider
than Michigan's home ice at Yost.
"It's going to be a lot quicker,"
Korzon said. "We are going to
have to be a lot faster and have a
lot smoother flow."
"This is the second time that
the U.S. has sent a women's team
to the WUG," Blackburn said.
"Two years ago in Turkey, we
learned that we need a fast team.
Our criteria (this year) was fast
with a lot of skill."
Leadership is another attribute
that the coaches are looking for
from the three Wolverines on the
roster. Two of the three - Korzon
and Griebe - are co-captains of
the Michigan club team.
Bates will be working closely
with Blackburn, the assistant
coach in charge of Team USA's
defense. Bates isn't afraid to leave
her position on the point and play
a major role in the team's offense,
which is just what Blackburn is
looking for.
Team USA doesn't have any
practices before leaving for the
tournament, so how it comes
together in those few weeks could
very well determine its success.
"We're all coming from dif-
ferent backgrounds and in such
a short time," Griebe said. "We
have to bring everyone together
and see what people's strengths
are individually."
Team USA will meet in Chi-
cago on Dec. 3, and then make
its way to Italy for its first game
of the tournament on Dec. 10
against Russia.

Hoke tries to crack
Spartan defense

Redshirtjunior midfielder Lauren Hauge tore her anterior cruciate ligament, then her medial collateral ligament, then her ACL again, hefore her retarn thin season.
Lauren iHauge: Staying
made hrstronger,

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily SportsEditor
Monday, Michigan football
coach Brady Hoke - who had
spent the earlier part of his press
conference admiring the Michi-
gan State defense - was asked, if
given the opportunity, would he
switch the Wolverines' defense
with that of the Spartans?
Hoke looked incredulously at
the reporter.
"No, no," he said. "I love these
kids."
Few coaches would prob-
ably want to swap their team for
another. But for as frequently as
he used the word "consistency"
when describing how the defense
would ideally perform, there have
to be times where the defensive-
minded Hoke wouldn't mind if the
Michigan defense took a page out
of the Spartans' book.
Michigan State boasts argu-
ably the top defense in the nation,
ranking in the top five for all major
defensive categories with nine
upperclassmen starting.
"They've done a nice job," Hoke
said. "Probably five or six pro play-
ers on that defense that they do a
nice job with."
And how many NFL-caliber
players do the Wolverines have on
their defense?
"Less than five or six," Hoke
said.
Come Saturday, Michigan will
be up against that staunch Spar-
tans defense, and all eyes will-be
on how the matchup between that
defense and the Wolverines' elec-
tric offense plays out.
For as many big offensive plays
the Wolverines make, there are an
equal number of big mistakes in
execution.
"Turnovers" and "ball securi-
ty" have once again become buzz-
words associated with the key
to beating the Spartans' defense.
Offensive coordinator Al Borges
talked Tuesday about how fre-
quently and effectively Michigan

State capitalizes on turnovers,
saying that if Spartans are able to
force redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner into makinga mis-
take, it could easily turn "a bad
play (into) a disaster."
"You're goingto have a certain
number of plays during the course
of a game that are a little ugly,"
Borges said. "As much as you'd like
to think that everything's going to
turn out exactly as you planned,
that's just not the real world of
football."
The Spartans allow just 3.55
rushing yards per attempt - the
second-lowest number in the
nation. Michigan has spent most
of this season tinkering with its
offensive line to try and maxi-
mize the ground game even more.
Fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint guaranteed
that the interior line would be
ready to show up on Saturday to
help him run the ball. Freshman
guard Kyle Bosch got into a skir-
mish with junior linebacker Jake
Ryan on Sunday, so Toussaint and
the coaches know the line is pre-
pared to be aggressive enough to
counter Michigan State.
Scuffles during practice aside,
the rest of the Wolverines are
doing as much as they can to pre-
pare for the weekend.
Fifth-year senior left tackle
Taylor Lewan said he has already
watched 12 hours of film on the
Spartans' defense, defensive end
Shilique Calhoun in particular.
Fifth-year senior wide receiver
Jeremy Gallon said the receivers
have an increased emphasis on
blocking this week to try and cre-
ate even more opportunities for
Toussaint.
Hoke said he's liked the focus
from practice so far thisweek, and
that the other major key to crack-
ing Michigan State will be the
coaching staff making the right
play calls.
"We'll have a planthat will give
our guys the best chance to win,"
he said.

0 n Oct. 6, the Hauge
family went out to
dinner to celebrate a
family birthday when Lori Hauge
took out her phone to record a
video of the family - 20 in all.
It wasn't to capture the waiter
bringing out a special birthday
dessert with a candle in it. It
was a congratulatory video for
her daughter, Lauren, a redshirt
junior on Michigan's field hockey
team. Lauren had just scored her
firstcollegiategoalbyknockingin
a rebound late in a game against
Ball State. 900 miles away back
honie in Tulsa, Okla. her fam-
ily had been following the game
online.
Hauge made her college debut
earlier this year in the Wolver-
ines' first regular-season game
against Massachusetts.
Hauge won't remember the
details of either game though -
she'll remember that, for the first
time in her college career, she
got to be out on the field. Playing
for the first time and scoring her
first college goal four years after
she graduated from high school
wasn't Hauge's plan, but injuries
didn't adhere to her schedule.
Hauge made a hobby of col-
lectingvarsity letters on the fields
and A's in the classroom in high
school. The four-year honor-roll
student earned 12 total varsity
letters in soccer, field hockey and
track and field. For a while, she
thought that soccer would be the
sport she would pursue in college.
The three-sport athlete had the
opportunity to stay close to home
in Tulsa, where she could have
played soccer at Tulsa or Okla-
homa. She would have been able
to go to school where she grew up,
close to friends and family.
"As my senior year rolled
around, I was like, I kind of want
to get away, and see the world and
do all that," Hauge said.
And with that see-the-world
mindset, she decided to forgo soc-
cer - a sport she'd played since
she could walk - and instead
pursue field hockey, which she'd
only played during high school.
She took an official visit to Michi-
gan in January 2010, and being on
campusewas a "game changer" for
her. She watched the men's bas-
ketball team take on Indiana, met
former Michigan fpotball coach
Lloyd Carr and went to a field
hockey morning workout.
A basketball win over Indi-
ana and a.handshake with Carr
were enough to convince Hauge
that Michigan was the place for
her. She eventually left home and
headed to Ann Arbor.
Hauge elected to redshirt her
freshman year in order to develop
as a player.
"Lauren's very competitive,"

said Bob Hauge, Lauren's dad.
"So I think the mindset of her
redshirting her first year there
was that if (Michigan coach)
Marcia Pankrat could teach her
the skills that she would need to
play at that level, what Lauren
(already) had engrained in her
was the competitive spirit or that
drive.... I think Lauren wanted to
get her skills up to a place where
she would beoa contributing mem-
ber of the team."
She didn't know at the time,
though, that she'd be on the side-
line for another two years after
that because of injuries.
The summer before her red-
shirt freshman year, Hauge got
hurt during a summer scrimmage
at a field hockey camp she was at
in Michigan. A player fell on her
knee the wrong way, causing it to
swell up so muchthat thetraining
staff couldn't even tell the extent
of her injury. Hauge didn't know
it at the time, but she had torn her
anterior cruciate ligament.
"I actually didn't think it was
torn," Hauge said. "I went up
north with one of my teammates
that weekend, and I kayaked and
talked about water skiing and
then I was like, 'You know, my
knee hurts. I probably shouldn't
do that.' Then the next week, I
went to the doctor and found out
I had torn my ACL."
Just like that, her season ended
before it even began. She had to
turn her attention from refocus-
ing on field hockey to rehabbing
her knee. She went back home to
Tulsa for surgery, where doctors
completely immobilized her knee,
forcing her to use crutches.
"It was really hard," Hauge
said. "Because you redshirt and
you make that decision that you're
going to develop as a player, and I
felt like I made some really great
strides my freshman year. So
to have (the injury) happen in
the summer before I even got a
chance to show what Ican do was
really hard."
Despite the setback, Hauge
didn't give in. She got up, worked
hard during her rehab as she was
forced to learn to walk again, pre-
pared for her junior season and
was back practicing just four and
a half months later.
***
But injuries would hinder her
progress again. During the pre-
season of her junior year, she tore
her medial collateral ligament.
She continued to play, though,
because an MCL injury heals by
itself over time. But it weakened
her recently recovered knee, and
while warming up for a game at
Bucknell, Hauge felt the same
knee pop.
Another torn ACL. Another
season on the sideline.
"It was just complete disbelief,
and I had second guesses about
what my body could do which
is scary," Hauge said. "Because
when sports is your life and sports
is what you do, you almost feel
like your body is betraying you,

and when you can't do the thing
that you love the most, it's really
scary. The second time (the inju-
ry) happened, it felt completely
out of my control."
Hauge chose field hockey over
soccer. She chose Michigan over
staying close to home. But now,
for the third year in a row, she
could only watch. What if she had
stayed in Oklahoma? What if she
had chosen soccer?
"I feel like everybody sort of
wonders, and it's sort of the whole
'the grass is greener,' "H Hauge
said. "When you're in the dark-
ness of your rehab, you might
think about ita little bit.... I made
the right choice because even
going through all of this has made
me a better person. Is it unfortu-
nate, and would it have happened
if I was playing a different sport?
I don't know. I think it made me
stronger at the end of the day."
It did make her stronger. The
injury made her a better team-
mate and abetter person.
Unable to playand stuck on the
sideline for the third consecutive
year, Hauge did what she knew
best: recovered and supported
her teammates. During her inju-
ries, she traveled with the team to
all their games except for one that
directly followed her surgery. She
was also designated as the unof-
ficial warm-up music selector.
Pankratz doesn't like her play-
ers each plugged into their own
worlds on long bus rides. She likes
them listeningto music as asteam.
Hauge was in charge of providing
the bus mixtape for trips to away
games - a job that allowed her
to feel like a part of the team and
that she was contributing.
"I think that if you're injured
and you can't do your first-best
thing, which is being successful
yourself," Hauge said, "at least
having your best friends (around)
and seeing your best friends be
successful is great."
Recovering from an ACL injury
isn't easy - recovering from two
of them is an even greater chal-
lenge.
"To have that devastating inju-
ry once is really hard," Pankratz
said. "And the ability to be resil-
ient, persevere, train like she did
and be focused on getting back -
she really was remarkable in her
rehab, and I admire her fortitude
and her strength to be able to do
that. To have it happen again and
start all over was super tough."
After surgery she worked hard
to recover again with hopes of
playingduringher redshirt junior
year - and earlier this season she
finally did. More than three and a
half years, two ACL injuries and
countless hours spent rehabbing
later, Hauge made her college
debut against Massachusetts.
Pankratz entered Hauge as
a sub, and it was as if the clouds
that had hovered above the field

for the game in Orono, Maine had
suddenly cleared away.
"We have this whole thing that
we talk about all the time," Hauge
said. "It's representing the block
'M.' So going in against Massa-
chusetts was the first time I actu-
ally got to represent and wear the
block 'M.' I can't even describe
the elation. I didn't even feel
tired. I was just running all over
the place. I wasn't even thinking.
I feltso honored, and it was such a
long time coming."
Since her debut, Hauge has
appeared in 11 games this season
for Michigan (1-2 Big Ten, 8-6
overall). One of the things she is
most excited about now is getting
the opportunity to play with her
class - the fellow seniors on the
team.
"I want to make an impact.
I want to play the role that I'm
meant to play," Hauge said. "I
want to put some points on the
board. That would be great. I
can't wait for the first time my
name shows up on the stat sheet
as far as goals and assists. I think
that's the next big milestone com-
ing forward."
And on Oct. 6, with her family
followingback home, she checked
that off her list.
Every year the Wolverines win
the Big Ten, the team gets cham-
piopship rings. Each player can
choose something to engrave into
the ring..Hauge's freshman year,
she and the other members of her
class chose "Those who stay" as
the words to adorn their Big Ten
championship ring. They hoped
to finish the saying on their senior
rings. After winning the Big Ten
again her sophomore year, Hauge
chose to engrave "It made me
stronger" on her ring.
"I put that in there because,
even though I wasn't on the field
and playing in the games, I felt
like I played a role in our success,"
Hauge said. "I felt like I support-
ed everybody else's successes, and
even though it's definitely not the
way you wanta season to turn out,
just being a part of anything like
that, when it doesn't go your way,
makes you stronger."
Hauge was stronger, and so
was Michigan.,Her presence on
the field and not on the sideline
will matter that much more this
season, and she won't get tired
anytime soon of going out to play.
"At the end of the day, you're
playing for Michigan, and what
you're doing is so much bigger
than you," Hauge said. "Because
you're on the team - not only are
you on the team, you're on the
Michigan team. At the end of the
day that's just something that'll
put fire in your belly no matter
what."'
She could've chosen a different
sport, or given up, but now, with
two Big Ten championship rings
engraved with "Those who stay"
and "It made me stronger," Hauge
is working for one more that will
read "Will be champions."

Michigan soars in
exhibition against
tiny Concordia
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
At 7:03 on Tuesday night, the
Michigan men's basketball team
finally laid last year's Final Four
squad to rest - unofficially at
least.
The Wolverines won the exhi-
bition's opening tip - and every-
thingelse - inal17-44 shellacking
over Concordia of the NAIA.
"Offensively, we knew things
were going to come for us," said
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas.
"It was a lot of fun out there. It
feels like a CONCORDIA 44
year since MICHIGAN 117
that Louis-
ville game, so just to get back out
there...it was just a great feeling."
For the second time in as many
years, sophomore Spike Albrecht
was the starting point guard in
Michigan's exhibition opener. But
unlike last season, when he was
merely a fill-in for the suspended
Trey Burke, fans got a real taste of
the Wolverines' backcourt - or at
least as much as their Washtenaw-
county neighbors could-muster.
Freshman point guard Derrick
Walton Jr. - Burke's replacement
- made his unofficial collegiate
debut, doling out two assists in his
first stint on the floor after check-
ing in at the 16:27 mark of the first
half. The freshman finished with
11 points and four assists, but it
was a trio of sophomores that cap-
tured the night's spotlight.
Stauskas scored 12 first-half
points - at one point outscoring

ished an easytransition layup and
then turned his own steal on the
ensuing possession into another
finger roll.
"It's exciting to get the jitters
out, the pregame jitters," Walton
said. "Going out there and making
those plays just boosted my confi-
dence going forward."
Robinson and LeVert closed
the half with a pair of monstrous
slams. Robinson then picked up
right where he left off, opening his
20-point second half with a pair
rim-rockers separated by just 20
secondsofeach other.
Even with the contest easily in
hand, Michigan left, its starters
and significant contributors in
the lineup until the game's clos-
ing minutes, giving the program
one of its most lopsided victories
(unofficially) of all time. Michigan
coach John Beilein waited until
the final official timeout to insert
his trio of freshmen walk-ons.
The Wolverines shot 81.5 per-
cent from the field in the first
half, and finished the game with
a 65.1-percent mark. And though
the crooked numbers probably
say more about Concordia's defi-
ciencies than Michigan's offense,
Beilein was pleased with his
team's decision making - a factor
he stressed can be independent of
the opponent.
The Wolverines' 26 assists a
sign of the team's unselfishness
and willingness to pass up a good
look - which it had plenty of - for
a better one. The headman was
even pleased with the missed field
goals he saw.
"It's a great selling point for our
team thatyouscore over100 points
and I can recall two or three shots
that I have to go talk to somebody
that,you know, wecouldgetbetter
than that," Beilein said.

TODD NEEDLE/Daily TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas outscored the Cardinals for part of the first half. Sophomore forward Glenn Robinson 111 led all scorers with 33 points Tuesday,

the Cardinals by himself, 12-9.
Guard Caris LeVert picked up
where Stauskas left off, racking up
a game-high 14 first-half points.
Proving that he can be more than
just a defensive specialist off the
bench, LeVert flashed athleticism
that he simply didn't have last sea-
son, driving through the lane with
authority while also displaying
impressive touch from inside and
outside the arc.
Meanwhile, forward Glenn
Robinson III put on an all-star

weekend-esque clinic, winning
the night's dunk and 3-point
shooting contests. The forward's '
athleticism was always there, but
after blowing away players and
coaches in preseason practices,
he publicly revealed a smooth
jump shot that could make him
one of the most dangerous, well-
rounded players in the country.
Robinson led all scorers with 33
points, knocking down four of his
six long-range attempts. While
his dunks will make the highlight

reels, his efficient mid-range mark
and improved ball handling -
which resulted in terrifying drives
to the basket - will encourage the
Michigan coaching staff the most.
"If they keep finding me open,
I'm going to keep knocking down
the shots," Robinson said. "I've
just got to keep getting reps up and
keep doing what I do."
Concordia kept the game close
in the first seven minutes, but
after Michigan's lead was reduced
to five, last season's national run-

ner-up took control. The Wolver-
ines scored the next 19 points to
pull away, and closed the half on a
46-10 run to take a 60-19 lead into
the break.
Much of the run came with Wal-
ton quarterbacking the offense.
With such dangerous weapons
spread across the floor, Walton
described his situation as a "point
guard's dream," but at times, he
did much of the work on his own.
In a consecutive sequence, he
knocked down a 3-pointer, fin-

looked confident and relaxed.

Using a crossover and his tall,
lanky frame, LeVert was able to
weave through traffic on several
occasions in the first half. To put
an exclamation mark on his per-
fect 6-for-6 shooting display for 14

points in the first stanza, LeVert
took a fast-break pass from Staus-
kas with less than 10 seconds left
and hammered home a furious
dunk to cap off Michigan's 46-10
run to end the half

Playingeight minutes inthesec-
ond half, LeVert racked up eight
assists to complete a double-dou-
ble of 16 points and 10 assists. In
comparison, the Wolverines' two
designated point guards, sopho-

more Spike Albrecht and Walton,
combined for eight assists.
But LeVert didn't even know he
had that many. He was just happy
to be making an impact for his
team.

"I don't remember having
any of the assists," LeVert said.
"They did a great job -our team
of knocking down shots. I really
didn't even know until I came out
of the game."

her study abroad program that summer.
A "No Contact" sanction was put in place
where the respondent was not allowed to
be in the same area as S.B. or-contact her.
Under the new policy, sanctions still
are determined by OSCR using the infor-
mation from OIE's investigation. Input
is sought from both parties privately on
potential sanctions.
When S.B. arrived in her study abroad
location, the sanctions brought a new set
of complications.
"A woman from the study abroad office
e-mails me and goes, 'If you come in con-
tact with him and you don't leave his pres-
ence, we will send you home.' And I was
like, excuse me, what?" S.B. said. "I don't
have any sanctions. I'm not supposed to
have any punishments or sanctions on me,
I was not found guilty for anything. I'm
here to enjoy my trip, and I don't want to
have to think about this."
Her study abroad program became
occupied by anxiety and exhaustive
planning, hoping to avoid her perpe-
trator and the consequences she could
face. The situation left her feeling frus-
trated, especially when she reported that
the perpetrator violated the no-contact
order, but the University told her they.
couldn't prove the violation occurred.
"I didn't feel like (the University) took it
seriously and really followed through with
what they had put in place, and that also
goes with how the survivor is doubted or
not really believed," S.B. said. "It created a
more extreme power dynamic where I felt
like I had no control over the situation, no
control over my safety and my wellbeing,
which made that very difficult."
The perpetrator submitted an appeal
to the University that summer, which S.B.
had to respond to during her time abroad.
After that, she asked not to find out the
results of the appeal, emotionally drained
and done with the process.
Though S.B. had finished formally deal-
ing with the matter, it still affects her today.
"Just randomly around campus, I've
seen him while I'm going for a run or just
walking down the street or in the Union,"
S.B. said. "(It's) pretty gut-wrenching, and
really awkward. It's just my mind starts
going a mile a minute, not even thinking,
just ... panic mode, basically."
S.B. said she supports the changes in the
new sexual misconduct policy, since it puts
less pressure on a survivor to decide if an
investigation should go forward. -
The University investigated only two
cases of sexual assault from 2009 to 2010
under the complaint-driven policy. From
2011 to 2012 - with the investigative
model in effect - 38 cases were investigat-
ed. University administrators interviewed
at the time believed this shift came from
the policy change rather than an increase
in sexual assault.
But for S.B., she said it was difficult to
learn that her own struggles specifically
influenced the changes.
"I guess I was kind of a guinea pig,"

S.B. said. "That sounds really bad, and
I guess it frustrated me because I felt
like a university should kind of be more
prepared or have more tools to address
these issues better."
A THIRD WAY TO HEAL
My friend who confided in me about
her own experience with sexual assault
illustrates the third option that S.B. and
all survivors of sexual assault have: to not
report an assault to the University or law
enforcement.
Barbara Niess-May, executive director
of the SafeHouse Center of Washtenaw
County -- an organization that serves
about 5,000 women, children and men
each year who experienced sexual assault
and domestic violence - said reporting
sexual assault to police is not just emotion-

"I was so conflicted, I didn't know what to
do and (OSCR) would relay back to me, 'You
know, the assailant wants to sit down with you
and apologize,' and that was really hard for me,
to hear. I wanted to hear an apology but then I
thought about it and ... that doesn't repair the
damage, and that can't come anywhere close to
repairing the damage."
- S.B., University alum and sexual
assault survivor

Organization, sexual assault can affect
survivors -not only physically but men-
tally and socially, leading to depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder and some-
times ostracism from their communities.
SAPAC and the SafeHouse Center
offer counseling and support services
for survivors through their recovery
process, ensuring people do not take
the journey alone. In the path to heal-
ing, survivors are never pushed into
making a certain decision and they
are offered unbiased support, though
Neiss-May said overall, the SafeHouse
Center believes in reporting.
Today, S.B. has regained her power.
She still gets nightmares every once
in a while about the incident, but she
believes she's healed through telling her
story, reporting the incident and pursu-
ing her study abroad trip regardless of

I think back to sitting on the concrete
floor with my friend, hearing her story.
I wanted to give her an answer, a rem-
edy for her anxiety and guilt. But know-
ing what I do now, there isn't one right
answer or solution.
Each path - reporting, not reporting
- brings challenges, whether from the
justice system, society's misconceptions
or one's own emotions.
The University security report shows
an increase in forcible rapes reported
to the police or other campus security-M
groups, with 10 incidents reported it
2011 and 21 in 2012. But is this numbe:
showing that the occurrence of the crim,
has increased, or could it just mean more
reports have been made out of the esti-
mated 72 percent that go unreported
each year? It's difficult to know.
I asked each person I interviewed
the same question: How do we fix this
on campus? The answers were endless:
improving the justice system to work
more effectively for survivors, edu-
eating society so jurors have a bette...
understanding of the crime, removing
insensitive cultural representations of
rape and sexual assault. For law enforce-
ment, like assistant county prosecutor
Liddell, it's a particularly frustrating .
question.
"I think sometimes we're just climbing
uphill, because there are these cultural
perceptions and a lot of victim blaming,"
Liddell said. "I always tell the victim,
'You're the brave one' ... For every one of
you, there are 30 that don't come forward
at all. Just to go through this process
whatever the outcome may be, hopefully
it's a conviction, but nine times out of ten
it's not. For them to stand up, that's what
impresses me. That's what makes me do
this job."
It's easy to sit at freshman orienta-
tion, the words "one in four" projected
on screens and printed on pamphlets, to
brush aside the reality of that statistic. I
did. S.B. did.
"Before, I would have never thought
that this would have happened to me,"
she said. "I come from a good town, I'm
smart, I'm a college student. But it can
happen to anybody, and none of those
factors necessarily matter."
When you meet multiple people and
friends who are part of these statistics,
you can see the meaning of those num-
bers change before your eyes. And those
numbers are difficult to gather them-
selves due to the nature of the crime.
For SAPAC director Rider-Milkov-
ich, she's most anxious to see those
statistics change and a decline in the
number of University students who
even enter the difficult maze of coping"
with sexual assault.
"What I really get out of bed every
morning. excited to do is working
towards preventing it from ever happen-
ing to begin with, to never have a stu-
dent have their lives and their learning,
interrupted by a traumatic experience

ally draining, but'time consuming, which
can deter survivors from reporting.
Niess-May said there are often 30 to
50 steps in a conviction, and survivors
might make a practical decision to forgo
the long, emotional process. Survivors
might fear their parents finding out or
fear the assailant, especially if they are a
high-profile person.
Assistant county prosecutor Liddell
said getting a case on trial is a process
that can take anywhere from six months
to a year after the police report is passed
along to the prosecutor. County prose-
cutor Mackie was quick to point out that
even without reporting, the crime occu-
pies a survivor's time.
"When you say time commitment, if
it's never reported, there's a huge time
commitment on behalf of the victim.
because this is on her mind," Mackie
said. "So, I hesitate to even think about
time commitment. It can occupy most
of a person's waking hours when they're
traumatized by something."
S.B. said she became severely
depressed after she was sexually assault-
ed. According to the World Health

the perpetrator's presence.
"I think I've been able to kind of sur-
pass it, actually," S.B. said. "Obviously, I
would never wish this upon myself or any-
one else, but I feel like the kind of strength
that I had to gather and the way that I had
to stand up for myself is something that I
would never have had to do in any other
situation. I feel like I've gained a greater
sense of self."
But she recognizes her path isn't for
every survivor. After listening to a survi-
vor panel at an advocacy event, she real-
ized that each survivor's healing process is
unique, but giving time to heal and know-
ing you're not alone is most important.
"I guess in a way it made me feel less
isolated, because I'm just thinking,
'Why am I still thinking about this three
years later?' " S.B. said. "Everyone's
path to recovery is so different, and they
just said don't worry about why you're
thinking about this and allow yourself
that time and that space to heal."

people, and knowing that that's going to
be the scrutiny that they're going to be put
under."
Oftentimes, juries aren't educated on
the intricacies of a sexual assault crime,
according to Washtenaw County prosecut-
ing attorney Brian Mackie. In court cases,
prosecutors find it difficult to show the
jury that delayed reporting and a lack of
physical evidence are typical in cases.
"The worst thing jurors can say, some-
times they really want to talk to you after
(a trial), it's usually after a not guilty, they
just can't wait to talk. And first thing out of
their mouth is, 'We all agreed that he did
it.' Ok? ... but (the verdict was) not guilty
because they wanted more," Mackie said.
Surprisingly, Liddell and Mackie both
say that female jurors are more criti-
cal towards survivors, arguing that they
would have acted differently to avoid the
incident - a form of survivor blaming.
"It's pretty scary. It's a defense mecha-
nism," Mackie said. "If you admit that this
happened to this person who's in front of
you, that means it could happen to you.
And we all like to think of ourselves as, not
invincible, but, 'I just wouldn't be in that
situation.' When you talk to victims, you
get similar statements from them, 'It was a
nightmare. It seemed like this couldn't be
happening,' but it was."
Pillsbury also stressed that if a sur-
vivor doesn't wish to go forward with a
case passed along to the prosecutor, their
request is usually respected by the pros-
ecutor's office - not because the case isn't
serious, but out of respect to the survivor's
APPwishes and wellbeing.
So why report'to the police if it's pos-
sible the case can't be pursued? For one,
making a report can help identify repeat
offenders, a phenomenon that both Pills-
bury and University Police spokeswoman
Diane Brown have experienced in their
careers. Reports can be linked, and sur-
vivors will be re-approached and notified
that another survivor has come forward,
which can distribute the burden of going
forward with an investigation.
"Frequently, people who commit this
crime commit it over and over again over
the course of their lifetime until they're
held accountable," Pillsbury said.
Pillsbury added a survivor could gain
strength just from police validation that
what they experienced was a crime, even
if the police can't hold the alleged perpe-
trator accountable. To be believed by the
system, Pillsbury said, is powerful.
Liddell, Mackie, Brown and Pillsbury
all said that it's up to a survivor whether
reporting or not reporting to the police
is the best way for them to heal. But it
becomes complex since law enforcement
wants to see alleged perpetrators held
liable.
"That's the struggle. You don't want to
be one more person saying, 'This is what
you have to do. Here are your options, here
are your choices,' " Liddell said. "You want
a' to give them as much power as possible to

help them reclaim what was taken from
them. But, you counter that with want-
ing to see justice done and wanting to see
someone held accountable and respon-
sible."
The Washtenaw County prosecutor's
office deals with 90 to 126 criminal sexual
conduct charges per year, but the major-
ity of cases involve child survivors. In her
three years as an assistant prosecutor, Lid-
dell has not had a single case involving a
University student.
S.B. has not made a report with the
police. Four months after she was raped,
she filed a complaint with the University,
a process that brought about its own emo-
tional difficulties and deterred her from
reporting to the police.
"I definitely thought about (reporting
to the police), and I actually thought about

instances of sexual misconduct they learn
about through non-confidential sources.
Previously, when S.B. filed her complaint,
investigations had to be driven forward by
the complainant, putting more responsi-
bility on the survivor.
Per the new policy, SAPAC, the Univer-
sity's Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices and the Office of the Ombuds are the
only confidential sources for survivors.
Any reports shared with other University
officials, includingresidence hall advisors,
should be passed along to the University's
Title IX coordinator for investigation.
If the complaint constitutes a crime, the
Title IX coordinator is obligated to inform
law enforcement.
The police, however, cannot proceed
with a criminal investigation without a
report from the survivor unless the case

"If you admit that this happened to this
person who's in front of you, that means it
could happen to you. And we all like to think of
ourselves as, not invincible, but, 'I just wouldn't
be in that situation.' When you talk to victims,
you get similar statements from them, 'It was
a nightmare. It seemed like this couldn't be
happening,' but it was."
- Brian Mackie, Washtenaw County
prosecuting attorney

dealt with all violations of the statement
at the time. Now, the University's Office
of Institutional Equity investigates sexual
misconduct violations.
S.B. said OSCR asked if she wanted to
go forward with "Formal Conflict Reso-
lution" - a hearing - or "Adaptable Con-
flict Resolution," which involved more of
a negotiation setting. For S.B., there was
nothing to negotiate.
"I was so conflicted, I didn't know what
to do and they would relay back to me, 'You
know, the assailant wants to sit down with
you and apologize,' and that was really
hard for me to hear," S.B. said. "I want-
ed to hear an apology but then I thought
about it and ... that doesn't repair the dam-
age and that can't come anywhere close to
repairing the damage."
Under the new policy, informal resolu-
tion is still an option for resolving some
sexual misconduct cases, but the policy
now specifies "never in sexual assault
cases." The investigations now primarily
consist of private interviews and written
statements - not hearings where the two
parties face each other.
Six months after the incident, a hear-
ing took place, which S.B. described as a
draining 12-hour process. An objective
individual who worked for the Univer-
sity heard the case. The respondent and
S.B. were in the same room, and she said
they were able to ask each other questions
through an OSCR moderator. S.B. brought
her SAPAC advocate, and the respondent
brought an advocate, too.
"I just felt like he was drilling me, drill-
ing me asking me all of these questions,
like, asking me to relay in super intense
detail exactly what happened," S.B. said.
Through the moderator, the perpetrator
asked S.B. to describe what she wore at the
time of the assault, a question that espe-
cially upset her, she said, since her attire is
irrelevant to his actions.
OSCR ruled the respondent in violation
of the University's statement. While the
University agreed he was guilty of sexual
misconduct, what still shook S.B. was what
happened at the end of her hearing, her
voice becoming noticeably frustrated as
she spoke about it.
She was approached by OSCR and
pressed to say what sanctions she felt were
appropriate. The respondent was still in
the room reacting to the verdict, an upset-
ting sight for S.B. Overcome with emotion
as she watched the perpetrator react, she
spoke opposite of how she really felt.
"I didn't have time to think about it, I
panicked ... So at the time I was just like,
'Don't take him off of the study abroad
trip.' Which was the dumbest thing I could
have ever said, but I didn't know what to
say," S.B. said.
She later learned that she wasn't obli-
gated to comment after the hearing.
The sanctions stemming from the hear-
ing further upset S.B. While the University
ruled that the respondent was in violation
of the statement, he was still able to go on

pressing charges against the University,
because I did not think the way that they
handled the (complaint) was just at all,"
S.B. said. "But after the (University) hear-
ing and everything, I just didn't want to
deal with it anymore ... It's even popped
into my head now, like, what would have
happened if I had pressed charges? But I
think it would have just been too emotion-
ally draining."
SEEKING 'U' SANCTIONS
Separate from a criminal investigation,
the University also has an internal policy
to review possible violations of the State-
ment of Student Rights and Responsibili-
ties, which prohibits sexual misconduct. If
a student is found in violation of the state-
ment, non-criminal sanctions range from a
formal reprimand to expulsion.
S.B.'s complaint was reported at a time
when the University addressed violations
of sexual misconduct differently than
today. In the current policy - which went
into effect August 2013 - the University
itself is now required to investigate all

involves domestic violence, according to
UMPD Officer Pillsbury.
At the University, if a student does not
wish to be involved with the internal
investigation, the Title IX coordinator and
a panel of University members decide if
the investigation should continue.
But S.B.'s case occurred before the new
policy, meaning she had the responsibil-
ity of pushing her complaint forward for
internal review. She chose to drive the
case forward for a specific reason: the
alleged perpetrator was signed up to go
on the same study abroad trip as her that
summer.
"I didn't want him to be on my study
abroad trip because I didn't feel comfort-
able and I didn't feel safe," S.B. said. "I
didn't think that it would allow me time
to heal and give me the space that I need-
ed, and I didn't want to have to sacrifice
a study abroad trip because of something
that he had done and that was his respon-
sibility."
S.B. submitted a complaint to the Uni-
versity's Office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution, the branch of the University that
