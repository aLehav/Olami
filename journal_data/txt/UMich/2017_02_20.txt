The University of Michigan 

Hillel, the Black Student Union 
and 
NOiR 
fashion 
runway 

hosted an open Shabbat dinner 
Friday 
evening, 
followed 

by 
a 
conversation 
about 

intersectionality 
and 
activism 

facilitated by Yavilah McCoy, an 
African-American Jewish activist 
and educator. This event was a 
follow up to Thursday evening’s 
event, where McCoy spoke on 
similar topics.

Hillel’s weekly Shabbat dinners 

are normally attended by several 
hundred students, most of whom 
are Jewish, each Friday. During 
this event, about 20 non-Jewish 

students in leadership positions 
in BSU and NOiR joined them, 
sitting at round tables with Jewish 
student leaders in the center of the 
dining room.

The 
conversation 
McCoy 

facilitated focused on developing 
relationship-building skills and 
how these depended on an honest 
communication 
of 
personal 

truths.

Making the connection to the 

current political climate, McCoy 
expressed the importance of 
communicating personal truths 
— like the ones found in religious 
tradition — as key to outreach in 
difficult times.

“Tonight when we go into 

the secondary room together, 
we’re going to talk about what is 

Students and faculty alike 

ditched their winter coats and 
flocked outside Saturday to study, 
work or simply enjoy the sunshine 
and warm temperatures. But 
for environmental activists, this 
sudden increase in temperature 
was no blessing — it served as a 
reminder of global warming and 
the effects of climate change seen 
each day.

That 
afternoon, 
hundreds 

gathered to rally for a cleaner 
planet and to promote a healthier 
future for generations to come. 
Bearing 
signs 
with 
slogans 

such as “listen to the 97% of 
climate 
scientists,” 
“respect 

your mother” and “there is no 
Planet B,” protesters marched 
from downtown Ann Arbor to 
the Diag, where they heard from 
an array of speakers passionate 
about 
promoting 
protection 

of the environment and public 
health.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Lyndsey Covert, member of 
Epsilon Eta, the professional 
environmental 
fraternity 
on 

campus that co-sponsored the 
event, explained the importance 
of 
mobilization 
and 
the 

encouragement of community 
members to get involved in issues 
that matter to them.

“I 
think 
that 
the 
most 

important part of activism like 
this is just getting the word 
out to people who don’t really 
understand,” she said. “It’s just 

mobilizing to get people who 
aren’t really engaged in the 
movement curious about it, and 
maybe the more people that we 
have informed, the more people 
we have who are trying to do 
what’s right for the planet and the 
people who live on it.”

The rally came one day after the 

United States Senate confirmed 
the appointment of Scott Pruitt 
to the Environmental Protection 
Agency. Environmental activists 

expressed their concerns about 
the actions Pruitt has taken that 
they feel will potentially harm 
the well-being of the planet.

State Rep. Debbie Dingell 

(D–Dearborn) was the opening 
speaker at the event, where she 
highlighted 
these 
arguments 

opposing Pruitt’s policy.

“We now have a director of the 

EPA that says that global warming 
isn’t real,” she said. “His entire 
career has been dedicated to 

undermining the agency he was 
appointed to lead and opposing 
the laws he was asked to enforce. 
It’s scary — he’s the poster boy 
of rolling back environmental 
safeguards to benefit polluters 
and 
irresponsible 
business 

practices.”

Dingell 
further 
discussed 

issues 
that 
are 
even 
more 

concerning 
to 
environmental 

activists of Michigan specifically, 

An 
audience 
of 
about 
50 

Rackham students and community 
members gathered Friday evening 
at the Walgreen Drama Center for 
a panel discussion on the effects 
of 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

executive order banning travel and 
immigration from seven different 
Muslim-majority countries to the 
United States.

The panel, sponsored by the 

Engineering Office of Graduate 
Education and tailored toward 
graduate students, aimed to clarify 
questions surrounding the legality 
and status of the executive order.

It began with remarks from 

University President Mark Schlissel, 
who reiterated the words of his 
initial statement regarding the ban. 
He was among the first of university 
presidents to publicly denounce 
it, confirming the University of 
Michigan would not release the 
immigration status of any of its 
students.

“The leadership of the University 

appreciates that we’re a nation of 
immigrants,” Schlissel said. “We 
wouldn’t be who we are without

More than 200 students and 

community members came out 
Saturday night to celebrate and 
support 
Indonesian 
culture 

with 
Indonesian 
speakers, 

performances and dance. The 
annual event, held and organized 
by the Indonesian Students 

Association at the University of 
Michigan, was held in Rackham 
Auditorium and drew students 
with cultural demonstrations 
and a sense of community.

The 
ISA, 
also 
known 

as 
Persatuan 
Mahasiswa 

Indonesia di Amerika Serikat, 
is a national organization that 
serves 
to 
unite 
Indonesian 

students in the United States 
with chapters in almost every 

state.

Rosmalawati 
Chalid, 
the 

consulate general of Indonesia 
from Chicago, also came to 
the event, where she spoke on 
behalf of Indonesian people 
and shared with the audience 
facts about the identity and 
backgrounds that make up the 
diverse country.

She 
stated 
the 
country 

has more than 300 ethnic 

groups speaking about 700 
languages and emphasized 
the presence of a variety of 
religions being practiced, a 
majority of which, however, 
are predominantly Muslim. 
Furthermore, she reflected 
on the similarities between 
the 
political 
climates 
in 

both the United States and 
Indonesia, emphasizing the 
importance 
of 
embracing 

diversity to ensure the future 
of these nations.

“Looking back now at 

history and also in current 
political 
situations 
in 

Indonesia, 
tolerance 
and 

respect 
for 
diversity 
is 

key if Indonesia wants to 
prosper,” Chalid said. “We 
have to work hard to nurture 
the culture of tolerance, 
the respect for diversity, 
the respect for differences 
among the population if we 
want to prosper as a nation.”

The culture night kicked 

off 
with

25-year project of interview-
based performances. The five 
speakers of the event shared 
diverse experiences of being 
Muslim in the United States, with 
a common thread of coming to age 
after 9/11 in New York City.

“I think the urgency of the 

xenophobia that is rampant in our 
president’s new administration 
makes it very important to 
have Muslim people speak for 
themselves across this country,” 
Chong said. “These are real 
Muslims, 
they’re 
not 
actors. 

These are people who actually 
lived their lives in that culture, in 
that faith.”

The 
75-minute 
production 

has 
been 
performed 
more 

than 50 times nationally and 
internationally. Though the show 
was accompanied with music and 
choreographed for timing, hand 
gestures, etc., the script is based 
solely on interviews of the five 
speakers.

LSA 
sophomore 
Marilyn 

Schotland 
reflected 
on 
the 

performance after watching.

“These stories are so eloquent 

in the way they intermingle and 
intertwine, and the way they tell 
it on the stage,” she said. “I think 
about how I present my identity 
to other people and it’s a very 
interesting conversation to have.”

Sara Zatz, associate director of 

Ping Chong + Company, co-wrote 
Saturday’s performance. In a 
Q&A following the performance, 
she spoke about reaching larger 
audiences and using the show as a 
call for action.

“It’s really easy to think that 

we’re in a liberal bubble in Ann 
Arbor,” Zatz said. “It’s really easy 
to think you’re a liberal bubble in 
New York City ... Right now, the 
call to action is to take the next 
step beyond being sympathetic 
and being an ally, and being 
someone who is standing up and 
fighting — whether that is making 
sure your campus is a sanctuary 
school ... People need to go beyond 
being sympathetic and to being 
advocates and activists.”

One of the performers, Maha 

Syed, is a human rights and 
gender equity advocate. She spoke 
about working in social justice 
and protesting every day in New 
York City.

“I’m seeing Black Lives Matter 

turn up for the Muslim ban,” she 
said. “I’m seeing Muslims turn 
up for the ICE raid bans. It’s 
amazing and it’s the thing we’ve 
been in lacking for so long. To 
work in social justice, you have to 
believe in the goodness of people... 
People are starting to see the 
intersections of these systems of 
oppressions. If we all got together 
and did this together, we could 
change the way this works. So 
I really hope that is the shining 
light that comes out of so much 
pain.”

Syed said the performance 

gives a small sample of what the 
human experience looks like, 
particularly 
highlighting 
the 

diversity despite belonging to the 
same faith. She spoke about the 
performance an opportunity to 
reach out to Muslims, as well as 
non-Muslims. 

“All of these things need to be 

examined inside and out,” Syed 
said. “There are issues within 
the Muslim community on racial 
diversity, on tolerance just like 
every other religious or small 
community. Everyone needs to 
hear from everyone else.”

LSA senior Josephine Tan also 

reflected after the performance.

“I really like the intersection 

of identities. When you first read 
it, you think, ‘Oh, they’re just 
Muslims.’ But when you hear 
the stories, you know they are 
African American and Muslim, 
a feminist and Muslim, all of 
these different identities, and 
it’s really interesting to hear the 
intersection of these identities.”

LSA senior Brittany Chew 

echoed Tan’s remarks on the 
boundaries of identity.

“You 
see 
how 
everyone’s 

experiences are so different and 
it’s based on all of these different 
identities you hold. It shows it’s 
not additive — your identity is so 
much more complex based on the 
intersections of it,” she said.

Jim 
Leija, 
UMS 
director 

of education and community 
engagement, 
spoke 
about 

wanting university and high-
school students to start more 
conversation after the show. He 
reflected on his own education 
and said the performance allows 
for younger generations to have 
a dialogue on Islamophobia, 
identity and other issues.

Music, Theatre & Dance senior, 

Tsukumo Niwa echoed Leija’s 
sentiments. “Being an artist, 
myself, I see how difficult to 
put yourself out there,” she said. 

Niwa also discussed wanting 
to maintain dialogue of the five 
performers to spread word on 
campus.

“We don’t have to rely on these 

five folks to keep telling their 
stories and wear themselves 
down,” she said. “We can’t always 
have this space. We, as spectators 
in this performance, learning just 
a little more about their identities 
and their stories — it’s really 
important for us to keep the story 
going.”

One of the five speakers, Amir 

Khafagy, is a Muslim of Arab and 
Puerto-Rican heritage. In the 
Q&A, he discussed how much the 
increasing salience and meaning 
of the performance to him.

“It’s very important to tell 

your own story — the more you 
continue to allow other people to 
tell your story for you, to speak on 
behalf of you, or about you, you 
lose some sort of power,” Khafagy 
said. “I think doing this show, it 
gives the general public that Islam 
is not just this one thing — it’s 
diverse.”

He also talked about inaccurate 

media portrayal of Muslims in 
the United States. During the 
performance, he spoke about the 
difficulties of assimilation.

“There comes a point when 

you get sick and tired of a seeing 
a Muslim on an airplane, and 
people thinking he’s about to 
blow it up, (rather) than just go on 
a vacation,” Khafagy said. “Every 
time you turn on the news, we’re 
the bad guy, and that gets so tiring 
and you come to hate yourself. 
Growing up as a kid, as I talked 
about in the story, I hated myself.”

Chong agreed with Khafagy’s 

ideas of Muslim identity. “There 
are Muslims who wear chador, 
the headscarf, and there are 
Muslims who don’t. There are 
Muslims who are feminists, there 
are gay Muslims — it’s just like 
anybody else,” he said. “I want 
them to see the human faith of 
people who are Muslim and to 
see that it’s much more complex 
than a cardboard idea of what a 
Muslim is.”

Chong’s use of light, projection 

and sound — both musical and 
clapping — allows for a unique 
intersection of the artistic and 
political to intersect.

“I feel it’s important as an 

artist to facilitate some sanity 
into the discourse.” Chong said. 
“Sanity — meaning stability, 
meaning not creating lies about 
people.”

it that we’re enduring right now,” 
McCoy said. “What is at stake in 
this current storm that we’re in? 
Who are you? What do you bring? 
How can you feel centered not just 
in yourself, but in what about you 
preaches outward? A stand I have as 
an activist is not just what does our 
tradition say, but does it preach?”

She also explained the truth of 

Judaism was to stand up for racial 
equity and justice, and to speak out 
against xenophobia, homophobia 
and transphobia. At the end of the 

dinner, McCoy talked about how 
her Jewish identity informed her 
activism in the form of finding truth 
and justice in the world.

“My lived experience as a Jew is 

equity and justice,” she said. “That 
means that when I think of Torah 
— which is our Jewish tradition, 
our system of law — I define Torah 
as the way we understand what it 
means to go out into the world and 
stand for what is true.”

LSA sophomore Alona Henig 

said McCoy gave her a new 
perspective on the connection 
between Judaism and activism.

“I do think about my Jewish 

identity, but not in terms of when 
I’m doing social justice work,” 

Henig said. “But that was a new 
way of seeing it, with tradition 
and culture and community, in a 
way that I haven’t seen in Hillel 
before.”

In the workshop following 

the dinner, students answered 
prompts asking what emotions 
they 
felt 
most 
and 
least 

comfortable expressing in the 
contexts of home and social 
justice by standing next to posters 
in the room labeled with what 
McCoy called “core emotions” 
such as sad, mad, joyful, powerful 
and peaceful.

such as the Flint water crisis, 
Enbridge Line 5 pipelines and the 
Great Lakes nuclear waste dump.

Another 
common 
theme 

throughout the rally was the 
promotion of the reality of climate 
change and the statistics used 
to argue for its existence. Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
explained that with an increase 
in average warmer temperatures, 
at night and during the day, there 
has been a nationwide increase 
in precipitation and shorter 
winters.

“We have more precipitation 

over the last 60 years, 45 percent 
more precipitation each and every 
year,” he said. “That is dozens 
of Michigan Stadiums filled 
with water that we have in our 
community because of climate 
change, and it’s something we 
have to address.”

According to Taylor, the city 

has been working to promote 
environmental awareness and 
protection with methods that 
include increasing solar energy 

use 
throughout 
Ann 
Arbor 

and improving transportation 
infrastructure to help reduce 
emissions. In 2012, City Council 
unanimously passed its Climate 
Action Plan with the hope 
of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and the long-term goal 
of seeing a 90 percent decrease by 
2050.

With the efforts of local 

governments like the one in Ann 
Arbor, speakers urged attendees 
to strive to create even more 
change. They explained the 
importance of coming together 
to rally, to organize and to 
promote issues like protecting 
the environment.

During 
his 
presentation, 

state Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–Ann 
Arbor) asked citizens at the 
rally to look at the American 
flag waving behind them on 
the Diag and to understand its 
multifaceted 
importance 
in 

promoting all people and causes.

“That flag does not stand 

for greed, it does not stand for 
pollution, it does not stand for a 
climate that is warming,” he said. 
“That flag stands for our national 
parks. That flag stands for clean 
air and clean water. And someday 

soon, I know that that flag will 
stand for the nation that will take 
a lead in climate change fighting 
in this world.”

This sort of leadership is one 

that is encouraged at events such 
as Saturday’s rally, and one that 
often begins with the individual. 
Business senior Anna Norman 
explained how crucial it is all 
people take action to promote 
ideas they are passionate about.

“It’s definitely a time for active 

engagement,” she said. “I think 
a lot of us say that we care about 
these issues, but unless you leave 
your house on a Saturday and 
participate, you’re not really 
doing your part.”

Following 
the 
rally, 

participants were invited to 
participate in advocacy activities 
in the Dana Natural Resources 
Building. 
Participants 
were 

given prompts to make phone 
calls 
and 
write 
letters 
to 

legislators, and in another room 
a large chalkboard with the “5 
Pillars of Waste Reduction” was 
available for attendees to write 
statements about what they will 
do to improve on the pillars of 
refuse, reduce, reuse, repair and 
recycle.

hard-working people from all 
over the world that come here to 
educate themselves … please don’t 
be discouraged by what I hope is a 
hiccup in American history. Please 
realize that we’re committed to 
you as members of our community, 
and we’ll do all the things we know 
how to do … to support you and 
your education.”

As a citizen of one of the 

seven banned countries herself, 
event organizer Mina Jafari, a 
Rackham student, expressed 
her own confusion about how 
the ban inspired her to bring 
information to her peers.

“I’m from one of those 

seven 
countries, 
and 
this 

whole situation, especially the 
weekend after the executive 
order, raised lots of questions 
and concerns among people 
affected and even people who 
are 
not 
directly 
affected,” 

Jafari 
said. 
“It’s 
not 
just 

international 
students 

from those seven countries; 
the 
entire 
international 

community is very worried 
about what’s going to happen 
next.”

Panelists aimed to satisfy 

this need for knowledge by 
speaking about the legal and 
administrative aspects of the 
executive order. Each stressed 
the complexity of the issue and 
encouraged students to reach 
out to any of their offices for 
individualized assistance in 

navigating the ban.

Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 

University 
vice 
president 

for 
government 
relations, 

spoke about the University’s 
collaboration 
with 
other 

organizations and officials like 
the Association of American 
Universities 
since 
the 

introduction of the ban. 

“These 
activities, 
one 
on 

their own is not sufficient, but 
collectively, in ways that we try to 
join the other interested and very 
seriously impacted organizations 
helps us to amplify the messages 
we want to be sure are heard,” she 
said, explaining the collaboration 
aimed to advocate for students’ 
rights under the order.

space for them to speak, the media is 
just perpetuating stereotypes.”

Saturday’s production is a part of 

a series, “Undesirable Elements,” a 
25-year project of interview-based 
performances. The five speakers of 
the event shared diverse experiences 
of being Muslim in the United States, 
with a common thread of coming to 
age after 9/11 in New York City.

“I think the urgency of the 

xenophobia that is rampant in our 

president’s 
new 
administration 

makes it very important to have 
Muslim people speak for themselves 
across this country,” Chong said. 
“These are real Muslims, they’re 
not actors. These are people who 
actually lived their lives in that 
culture, in that faith.”

The 75-minute production has 

been performed more than 50 
times nationally and internationally. 
Though the show was accompanied 
with music and choreographed for 
timing, hand gestures, etc., the script 
is based solely on interviews of the 
five speakers.

LSA 
sophomore 
Marilyn 

Schotland 
reflected 
on 
the 

performance after watching.

“These stories are so eloquent 

in the way they intermingle and 
intertwine, and the way they tell it 
on the stage,” she said. “I think about 
how I present my identity to other 
people and it’s a very interesting 
conversation to have.”

Sara Zatz, associate director of 

Ping Chong + Company, co-wrote 
Saturday’s performance. In a Q&A 
following the performance, she spoke 
about reaching larger audiences and 
using the show as a call for action.

D

uring my senior year 
of 
high 
school, 
I 

went on an overnight 

Catholic 
retreat. 

The organizers of 
the retreat reached 
out to the attendees’ 
friends and families 
to 
collect 
letters 

about all sorts of 
things: 
what 
we 

meant to them, what 
their faith meant to 
them or even just 
offering 
general 

advice as we prepared 
to leave for college.

Watching 
the 

response around the country 
and on campus to President 
Trump’s divisive policies and 
rhetoric, a line from one of these 
letters stuck out in my mind:

“People often claim that hate 

is the opposite of love (I think 
they bought into that hate/love 
T-shirt or something). That’s 
not really true. The opposite of 
love is not hate, but rather fear, 
and from this fear, all negative 
and painful emotions flow.”

From 
the 
data 
alone, 

Trump’s 
signature 
policies 

thus far — the former travel 
ban 
and 
the 
border 
wall 

— 
seem 
indefensible. 
The 

administration defended the 
travel ban as being necessary 
for national security, but none 
of the 9/11 conspirators came 
from any of the seven countries 
targeted by the travel ban. 
Furthermore, since 9/11, there 
have been 10 deadly terrorist 
attacks on American soil — but 
none of the terrorists came 
from any of the seven countries 
affected by the ban. 

Yet when the media reported 

stories of individuals seemingly 
deserving of exceptions to 
the travel ban barred from 
entering the United States 
— long-time U.S. residents, 
individuals who risked their 
lives to help the U.S. military, 
college students and babies 
traveling to the United States 
for life-saving surgery — many 
still supported the policy by 
arguing that it was necessary 
to protect Americans from 
potential terrorists.

Facts and data may not 

be 
capable 
of 
explaining 

this reaction, but fear can. 
In Europe, massive flows of 
refugees — as many as 10,000 
per day and an estimated 
1 million total in 2015 — 
poured over the weak, under-
resourced southern borders 
of 
already 
financially 
and 

politically strained countries 
like 
Greece. 
This 
caused 

massive social and political 
shocks and damaged Europe’s 
tourism industry. Some of the 
refugees perpetrated deadly 
terrorist attacks.

However, 
there 
are 

obvious differences between 
the realities of the refugee 
situations in the European 

Union 
and 
United 
States, 

the starkest of which is the 
geographic distance between 

Greece and Syria, 
and 
the 
United 

States 
and 
Syria. 

Given 
that 
many 

refugees 
fled 

extremely desperate 
circumstances 
with a few precious 
belongings, it makes 
sense that refugees 
weren’t arriving on 
American shores in 
the same numbers 
they 
were 
on 

Greece’s shores.

Many 
migrants 
travel 

through Turkey and cross the 
Aegean Sea to get to Greece 
— a water crossing that is 
only about four miles at its 
narrowest point. Despite this 
relative proximity, more than 
3,000 
refugees 
have 
died 

attempting to reach European 
shores as of September 2016. 
Under similar conditions, the 
nearly 
6,000-mile 
journey 

from Syria to New York seems 
almost 
impossible 
under 

similar conditions.

In 
stark 
contrast, 
the 

United States admits a small 
number of refugees who pass 
the strictest vetting processes 
required of any immigrant 
group, and as far as all 
available data is concerned, 
are actually less likely to 
commit acts of deadly terror 
than Americans born in the 
United States. A whopping 84 
percent of jihadist terrorist 
were born in the United States. 
(Note: These numbers don’t 
include other major sources 
of domestic terrorism like 
right-wing terrorist groups, 
including white supremacists 
and 
neo-Nazi 
terrorist 

groups, and left-wing terrorist 
groups.)

None of this is to suggest that 

terrorism is not a real or credible 
threat — it is. But there is little 
reason to believe that this travel 
ban would save American lives. 
Additionally, in many respects, 
U.S. post-9/11 counterterrorism 
efforts have been successful. 
Further improvements should 
focus on strengthening the 
intelligence gathering efforts 
that have proven crucial to the 
fight against terrorism thus far.

But fear doesn’t engender 

evidence-based 
decisions. 

Fear promotes a try-anything-
and-everything 
approach. 

Fear 
prompts 
ordinarily 

rational people to project their 
concerns and anxieties on 
undeserving targets.

In this case, those targets are 

refugees. In other cases, those 
targets are Black and Hispanic 
men blamed for small upticks in 
violent crime rates, women and 
immigrants blamed for taking 
jobs that would ordinarily go 
to white American males.

Violent crime and economic 

stagnation 
are 
legitimate 

fears. The United States needs 
solutions 
to 
the 
problems 

of 
gun 
violence, 
widening 

income inequality and illegal 
immigration. But projecting 
these anxieties onto others 
and letting that animosity 
shape policy will not result 
in solutions to the very real 
challenges we face. In practice, 
letting fear — not evidence 
— drive policy may actually 
worsen our problems or create 
new ones. Even to those who 
accept harming members of a 
marginalized group as a cost 
of assuaging their fears should 
not accept outcomes that make 
the whole country worse off.

In 1947, the then-called U.S. 

Department of War released 
an anti-Nazi propaganda video 
titled “Don’t Be a Sucker.” The 
central character of the video 
was named Mike, an American 
everyday man who seemed to 
have everything going for him: 
He was young, healthy and 
owned a prosperous factory 
where free men and women 
from all over the world worked 
to produce products used all 
over the world.

“Mike’s 
got 
something, 

all right,” the narrator told 
viewers. “He’s got America. 
But there are guys who stay 
up nights, figuring out how to 
take that away from him.”

Who wanted to take America 

from poor Mike?

The 
video 
cuts 
to 
an 

angry white man addressing 
a 
crowded 
park, 
shouting, 

“We’ll never be able to call 
this country our own until it’s 
a country without … Negros, 
without 
alien 
foreigners, 

without 
Catholics, 
without 

freemasons.”

By attempting to protect our 

country and ourselves from 
outsiders, we risk strangling 
the things that make America 
truly great. We prevent others 
from bringing their new ideas, 
work ethic and diverse ways of 
looking at the world and the 
problems it faces— all essential 
ingredients to the innovation 
and enterprise that made our 
country the leader that it is.

Helping to preserve that 

beautiful version of America 
requires more than simply 
opposing 
Trump 
and 
his 

policies. If we really want to 
keep America great, we need 
to 
continuously 
challenge 

our own beliefs and address 
our own fears and their many 
manifestations. If we don’t, 
we leave ourselves vulnerable 
to those who want to use 
them against us in support of 
policies that will make us — 
and our country — worse off in 
the long run.

O

ver the past 20 years 
or so, it seemed like a 
new world order was 

emerging. Globalization took hold 
and we caught a glimpse of nation-
states disappearing and cultures 
intermingling. 
We 
seemingly 

saw 
ideological 
conflicts 

fade away and an increase 
of communications and free 
commerce. But was this nothing 
more than a tantalizing glimpse 
of what the world could be?

Now, more than ever, we are 

seeing a return to the strong 
nation-state and to nationalist 
ambitions. 
Politicians 
who 

advocate standing up for their 
country and making it “great 
again” have grown in power and 
influence, and not just in the 
United States.

According to President Trump, 

in order to make America great 
again, we must make national 
security a top priority. So what is 
national security? Traditionally, 
national 
security 
is 
centered 

around the idea of protecting the 
institutions of the nation-state. In 
the recent years of globalization, 
however, traditional security has 
been challenged by advocates 
who believe that security should 
be focused on the needs of the 
individual. National security is no 
longer limited to the protection of 
the nation itself, but now extends 
its concern to notions that are 
more intimate — the protection 
of 
human 
rights. 
This 
new 

extensive definition of national 
security that includes issues of 
human concern shifts attention 
away from the traditional state-
centered notions of security, 
characterized by state borders, 
to an approach centered around 
the people within.

As we return to the age of 

nationalist ambitions, we also 
return to the notions of traditional 
security. Yet the biggest security 
threat to face the nation, and the 
world, is not one that can be looked 
at in terms of traditional security. 
That threat is climate change and 
the depletion of vital resources.

According to Michael T. Klare, 

author of “The Race For What’s 
Left,” the world is facing an 
“unprecedented crisis of resource 
depletion.” 
Currently, 
all 
of 

Earth’s accessible areas are being 
exploited, demanding a search for 
new, and often environmentally 
dangerous, methods to extract 
resources. In a nationalistic world 
order, this could be extremely 
dangerous. 
As 
non-renewable 

resources are used up, those who 
advocate for traditional security 
would 
seek 
unconventional 

methods such as the use of extra 
heavy oil, transforming coal to 
liquids or extracting gas from 
shale 
formations, 
known 
as 

hydrofracking — processes that 
would lead to great environmental 
risks and human suffering.

Furthermore, 
because 

traditional security is focused on 
the state rather than the individual, 
it can be assumed that the 
centralized government has sole 
decision-making power, with no 
international regulation by which 
to abide. This is dangerous. Since 
resource scarcity and human-
induced climate change are global 
problems, they should be handled 
at an inter-governmental level, 
with notions of human security at 
the forefront.

While the United States might 

benefit economically in the short 
term by pursuing unconventional 
methods, as a citizen of the world, 
it is incumbent upon the United 
States to rise to the challenge to 
discover alternatives that limit 
the adverse impact of its policies 
on the world community at large. 
If every nation followed this 
approach, it would be possible to 
replenish scarce resources while 
limiting human-induced climate 
change. With respect to resource 
depletion, nations should not rush 
to extract the remaining vital 
resources, but rather engage in a 
race to adopt new materials and 
methods that would free the world 
from its dependence on finite vital 
resource supplies.

As students at the University 

of Michigan, it is critical that 
we embrace ideas that provide 
security for all 
 — whether that 

is investing in clean renewable 
energy, advocating for universal 
health care or fighting for equal 
access to quality education. 
After all, we are all just citizens 
of planet Earth.

T

here is nothing better 
than hearing your close 
friend share an intense, 

silly or emotional story from 
their 
day-to-day 
life. 
You 

giggle over the details of how 
they slipped down the stairs in 
front of a cute boy, you cringe 
when they had a panic attack 
on their way to their first exam 
and you feel heartbroken when 
they found out their grandma 
was sick. Through the give 
and take, you are invited to 
share their experiences. This 
is a way we catch up and learn 
from the people in our lives. 
Stories create a snapshot of 
their 
individual 
experience 

and we are granted full access 
to their unique perspective.

I 
have 
recently 
become 

fascinated with stories from 
complete 
strangers. 
One 

platform 
that 
showcases 

storytellers is The Moth. They 
have live shows, competitions, 
Radio Hours and a podcast 
online. The Moth airs and 
presents true stories told by 
real people from all over the 
world. I most likely will never 
meet these people, or even 
see a picture of them, but will 
know something intimate that 
they decided to share with the 
world. I began listening to The 
Moth on long drives and found 
the stories so captivating that 
sometimes I would have to pull 
over to finish them.

Last week, I was finally 

able to attend a live event, a 
StorySLAM, here in Ann Arbor. 
StorySLAMs 
are 
themed, 

open-mic competitions where 
those who want to share a 
story put their name in a hat 
and 10 are chosen to present 
for five minutes. Assigned 
audience members judge each 
storyteller’s piece individually. 
Their rating of each story is 
charted throughout the show and 
the winner of the SLAM moves 
on to the GrandSLAM, a larger 
scale competition show where the 
StorySLAM winners compete.

The Ann Arbor Distilling 

Company was jam packed. I 
walked into a room full of lively 
individuals, who filled all the 
seats, leaving standing room 
only. While I was anxiously 
waiting in line for the bathroom 
and trying not to miss the first 
story, I met a woman who drove 
with a group of friends all the 
way from Cleveland to join in on 
this special experience. I was 
amazed and humbled by The 
Moth listeners’ commitment 
to traveling near and far to 
support the live storytellers. 

The theme of the night was 

“bouncing back.” The stories 
ranged 
from 
experiences 

of bad breakups, childhood 
bullies, 
moving 
out 
of 

hometowns and other general 
moments of life’s confusion. 
The atmosphere of the crowd 
changed 
with 
each 
story, 

from smiles and laughter to 
silence and sympathy. The 
community of listeners was 
fully engaged in each story, 
following the lead of each 
storyteller on their narrative 
journey.

As I listened, I realized 

that I could relate many of my 
own experiences to those that 
were being presented at the 
mic. I could not help but start 
thinking of an outline for my 
own story that would fit this 
particular theme. Any one of 
us could find something in 
our lives to share under this 
general theme. I was reminded 
that everyone is a member of 
the shared human experience. 
We live in a world with many 
categories and binaries that 
seek to divide us, but often we 
are more similar than we are 
willing to admit.

The 
Moth’s 
platform 

highlights these similarities 
through 
real 
stories 
that 

connect us all. I truly believe 
if we take the time to listen 
to strangers’ stories we could 
learn from people who have 
vast differences from us. Even 
if our version of “bouncing 
back” is different than someone 
else’s, together we can work 
to understand complex issues 
from all perspectives. 

If you want to join in on 

this human experience come 
to the next StorySLAM at Ann 
Arbor Distilling Company on 
Feb. 21 at 6:30 p.m. Have a 
time conflict? You can always 
listen to stories online through 
TheMoth.org or through your 
local radio station.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

Happy birthday, mom.
Every 
morning, 
when 

choosing my outfit for that day, I 
try to imagine Rihanna wearing 
whatever I’ve chosen. If I can’t, 
back in the closet it goes.

If I can, however, I will wear 

those clothes. I will wear them 
and I will walk around campus 
and I will feel like I matter more 
than anyone else because I am 
Rihanna, dammit.

She 
may 
be 
turning 
29 

Monday, but Rihanna has been 
making and breaking all of 
fashion’s most ubiquitous rules 
since her debut on pop’s world 
stage in 2005. She could wear 

a paper bag and it would be 
art. From epitomizing every 
clothing trend of the early 2000s 
to reminding us that women 
have nipples, you, me and Anna 
Wintour have badgalriri to 
thank for bringing bravery to 
the forefront of 21st century 
fashion.

She may be the baddest bitch 

in the Western Hemisphere 
(fact-checked), 
but 
Rihanna 

is proof that anyone with guts 
can become a fashion icon in 
their respective community. 
Long since passed are the days 
of “I could never pull that off” 
— where would our sexy pop 
goddess be if she’d relented to 
self-doubt? Not rocking that 15 
thousand-dollar Saint Laurent 
heart cape, that’s for sure.

The Barbadian beauty queen 

carries indisputable clout in 
the world of fashion. She is 
currently the Creative Director 
of 
her 
own 
high-end 
line 

with Puma alongside Design 
Director Melissa Battifarano. 
Yet more transcendent than the 
frilly athleisure of Fenty x Puma 
is Rihanna’s everyday street 
style. A Gucci tracksuit here, 
a Balenciaga stole there. The 
woman can do no wrong; if she 
does, the rules will just change 
and the fashion industry will be 
on its merry way.

Rihanna is my fashion mother. 

If she won’t wear it, neither will 
I. Here’s to 29, badgalriri. Thank 
you for the boundary-breaking, 
the beauty and the courage. Be 
sure to pour it up tonight.

Lo Theisen talks The Menzingers, the going and the leaving 

MUSIC COLUMN

Where do we go now?

The Menzingers aren’t the 

first band to make youthful 
music for those who aren’t so 
young anymore, but they’re 
probably the most up front 
about it. The very first chorus 
on their new album, After the 
Party, asks the question that 
looms over all of the next 12 
tracks: “Where are we gonna 
go now that our twenties are 
over?”

Usually, when rock bands 

get older, they get softer. 
Compare the unhinged-comp-
lit-major bellowings on The 
Hold 
Steady’s 
Separation 

Sunday with the tighter, more 
traditional and melodic work 
of that band’s last two albums. 
Look at The Clash recording 
“Should I Stay or Should I 
Go” only a few years after 
“White Riot.” Not only is it 
difficult to keep up youthful 
fury an entire career, but most 
long-standing 
punk 
bands 

also switch up their sounds 
because, eventually, loud and 
fast becomes too tight a box.

The Menzingers have bucked 

this 
seeming 
inevitability. 

After the Party is a clear 
turning point for the band, but 
it doesn’t feel like anything 
was lost in this evolution. 
The band plays a show in 
Detroit next week, and these 
new choruses should get the 
crowd jumping and shouting 
just as much as older beloved 
work. Songs like the title 
track, “Midwestern States,” 
“Bad Catholics” and “Lookers” 
all 
feature 
immediately 

memorable melodies, no-frills 
guitar work and unrelenting 
drumbeats, just like you would 
expect from The Menzingers. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
slight 

structural experimentations of 
“Charlie’s Army” and “House 
on Fire” emerge as standouts 
on later listens.

It’s clear, though, that the 

bandmembers 
have 
learned 

a thing or two since their 
breakthrough album On the 

Impossible Past. While the 
band has been singing about 
the passing of time ever since 
they started making music, the 
nostalgia on old Menzingers 
tracks felt aspirational and 
naïve, as though singer Greg 
Barnett was crafting future 
memories that he anticipated 
looking back on. The images 
on 
classics 
like 
“Gates” 

and “Casey” are almost too 
expertly 
arranged, 
with 

cigarette-smoking waitresses 
flirting 
with 
hackey-sack 

playing stoners in a beautiful 
mural of Midwestern suburbia. 
Barnett seems to know exactly 
which words he needs to sing 
with his unpretty, garage-
band voice to get all his fans 
reminiscing on their fondest 
moments of adolescence.

After the Party’s details feel 

lived in, rougher and truer to 
life. The opening track puts 
us in a clear age, a fixed point 
in time rather than a hazy, 
curated nostalgic landscape. 
And so an early reference 
to 
“On 
the 
Road,” 
that 

cliché symbol of young male 
adventure, 
doesn’t 
prompt 

eyerolls, because it ends up on 
an album next to lines about 
falling asleep to dumb shows on 
Netflix. Lyrics that doubt the 
value of a college diploma hit 
hard with a whole generation. 
A 
violent 
ex-boyfriend 

sparks real menace, because 
we know that in real life, 
we’re not guaranteed safety 
and happy endings. These 
aren’t inspiring narratives of 
romantic Midwest heroism, 
but songs of self-doubt and 
earnest reflection.

But what I’ve been trying to 

decipher most about After the 
Party is how universal it feels 
despite being written from the 
perspective of one definite age. 
Just as The Menzingers have 
crafted more specific songs 
with precise details, they also 
seem to have expanded their 
potential fanbase. Sure, it’s 
understandable that a youthful 
break-up anthem like “Gates” 
may 
only 
inspire 
passion 

among a crowd that spends its 

nights waiting for service at 
Steak ’n Shakes and drinking 
pitchers in bowling alleys, 
but then why would After the 
Party reach anyone who hasn’t 
just turned 30?

More bluntly, how am I, a 

21 year-old senior in college, 
identifying with so much of 
this album? When I hear the 
couplet “Everybody wants to 
get famous/But you just wanna 
dance in a basement” I see the 
most vivid scenes of my friends 
at parties singing along to top-
40 pop. “There’s beer left, 
so I think I’ll stay” is a line 
I’ve definitely heard before. 
“Waiting for your life to start 
then you die/Was your heart 
beating in the first place?” 
feels terrifyingly urgent no 
matter what your age.

The truth, I think, is that The 

Menzingers have managed to 
write an evergreen chorus and 
then sustained it for a whole 
album. In my head, I can easily 
hear Bruce Springsteen singing 
something like that first song: 
“Where am I gonna go now 
that my sixties are over?” Ten 
years from now, it would be 
no surprise if the band’s new 
album leads off with: “Where 
are we gonna go now that our 
thirties are over?” To me, 
when I listen, I actually hear: 
“Where am I gonna go now that 
my college is over?”

What The Menzingers really 

get right is that After the Party 
isn’t any kind of ending any 
more than your thirties and 
beyond are a mere epilogue 
to your twenties. What one 
discovers over the course of 
this record is that it’s almost 
ridiculous to worry so much 
about dividing life into such 
distinct decades. In reality, we 
slowly and unknowingly evolve 
and reinvent ourselves, keeping 
the good stuff and gradually 
shedding 
what 
no 
longer 

feels true. We move from one 
thing to the next, but rarely is 
anything truly “over” until the 
very end. After the party, there 
are usually just a few missed 
alarms and, if you’re lucky, a 
delicious breakfast.

Hayes ponders self-image 
in new poetry collection

Terrance Hayes’s most recent 

poetry collection “How to be 
Drawn” builds upon the idea of the 
word “drawn” in a broad sense. In 
addition to being a poet, Hayes is a 
visual artist, his work pondering 
what it means to sit for a figure 
drawing. In an interview, he posed 
questions such as: “What does it 
mean to sit? What does it mean for 
someone to let me draw them?” 
He also pondered what it is to be 
“withdrawn” as well as how to 
move about the world, and drawn 
as in the sense of a horse-drawn 
carriage, wondering what it is to be 
seen and be engaged.

Terrance Hayes read in the 

apse of the UMMA this past 
Tuesday as part of the Zell Visiting 
Writers Series. Hayes is a former 
MacArthur fellow and recipient of 
2010 National Book Award as well 
as recently appointed Chancellor 
of the American Academy of Poets.

He read from his most recent 

collection of work, “How to be 
Drawn” and additionally shared a 
series of unpublished sonnets, each 
bearing the same title: “America’s 
Sonnet for my Past and Future 
Assassin.”

Hayes opened with a poem 

titled “Gentle Measures,” which 
alludes to an 1871 text that 
instructs parents on strict child 
discipline. In the poem, Hayes 
transcends time and space to 
navigate legacy, abandonment, 
God and love as one generation 
flows into the next. He ends one 
stanza, “Goddamn, I want to be 
as hardcore as my daddy,” and two 
stanzas later writes, “But I will 
not claim to know other people’s 
loneliness.” He mentions children 
growing up all over the globe, from 
Bolivia to Syria, moving seamlessly 
into reverence for things as small 
and tangible as a tongue painted 
inside a doll’s mouth and back 
to 
high-stakes 
statements 
of 

passion such as: “I have said I am 
in love with beauty,/but my heart 
is so mangled, it spills blood on 
everything.”

With this he suggests a love 

that exists within the crossroads 
of inexorable pain and hardship, 
worthy because it is under such 
constant and complicated threat, 
something persistent across racial, 
geographic and theological lines.

He read “American Sonnet for 

Wanda C.” — a sonnet dedicated 
to Wanda Coleman, a poet who 
acknowledged the sonnet as an 
inherently 
exclusionary 
poetic 

form and worked to reclaim it. 
Expressing her experience as 
a Black woman, she titles her 
sonnets “American Sonnets” as a 
way of probing previously accepted 
notions of American identity.

In a tribute to her, Hayes writes: 

“If there is no smoke, there is 
no party. I think of you, Miss 
Calamity/Every 
Sunday.” 
He 

embraces what can be made wild, 
radical or unpredictable within the 
confines of conventional form.

As a reading that took place 

on Valentine’s Day, it seemed 
only fitting for Hayes to read 
sonnets, best known as 14-line 
poems addressed to a lover, yet his 
sonnets are by no means swoony or 
adoring, as they dwell in imagined 
deaths and deep-rooted fear.

He introduced his series of 

unpublished sonnets, each bearing 
the title “America’s Sonnet for 
my Past and Future Assassin,” a 
collection Hayes began the day 
after the election. He described 
the poems as “weird.”

“They’re 
not 
like 
normal 

stories,” Hayes said. “People are 
used to thinking of poems and 
most things that are written as 
narrative.”

He claims that his poems do not 

always contain clear narratives, 
but are often are driven by tone or 
image.

“I 
recognize 
that 
my 

imagination is strange but I’m 
always trying to put people at 
ease,” he said.

The addressees of the sonnets 

range from a stinkbug to President 
Donald Trump to the color white. 
He 
revisits 
the 
omnipresent 

tension between light and dark 
with a line such as “part sanctuary, 
part panic room.” He pulls in 
references to music icons such as 
Prince and Jimi Hendrix (Hayes 
suggested that poetry is indeed 
music, the absence of instruments 
replaced by breath and voice). In 
writing these sonnets he asked 
himself: “Can I write a political 
poem phrased as a love poem?”

In one poem he repeats the 

n-word, 
associating 
it 
with 

different 
body 
parts 
— 
the 

repetition haunts the space and 
the poem ends with the line: 
“you will never assassinate my 
ghost.” Another poem addresses 
Sigmund Freud’s grandson Lucien 
Freud, an artist who encapsulated 
the perverse and strange. The 

poem dwells in the corporeal and 
contemplates the notion of the 
voyeur, using the word “pussy” 
liberally, much to the discomfort 
of the audience and even eliciting 
discomfort in Hayes himself.

However, 
this 
notion 

of 
discomfort 
or 
what 
one 

audience 
member 
identified 

as “provocative” is central to 
Haye’s poetic philosophy. He 
said that he likes to surprise and 
be surprised by his own work, 
exploring uncharted territory as 
far as writing poems that make 
him squirm a little. Hayes said that 
to read a piece of work that might 
make him anxious is a reminder.

“It just means that you’re still in 

the water, that you’re still working, 
that it’s a living breathing thing. 
It’s not even about perfection for 
me, it’s just about working. I like it 
because it makes me more alert,” 
Hayes said.

In another sonnet he addresses 

Donald Trump, invoking the 
color orange with phrases such as 
“goldfish pumpkin,” and a line, “I 
know your stage.” Another poems 
recounts images of whiteness in 
the form of a near-alphabetized 
list — “Aryans, Betty Crocker, 
blowfish, 
bullhorns, 
carcasses, 

etc.”

Hayes’s 
adherence 
to 
the 

traditional sonnet form amplifies 
his contained restlessness, as his 
final sonnet contains the eerily 
comprehensive lines, “You just 
wanted change is all,” and, “May 
your restlessness come to rest.”

This 
constant 
motion, 
a 

pursuit of restlessness and slight 
discomfort 
supports 
Hayes’s 

philosophy as a teacher of poetry.

“It is a practice. It’s not a 

product. It’s a process,” Hayes tells 
his students. “I’m trying to say you 
should always be thinking about 
what you’re making, what the next 
thing is, opposed to letting the dust 
gather on a handful of really great 
poems you’ve written. I don’t think 
that’s what it’s about.”

Hayes concluded the reading 

by sharing “The Rose Has 
Teeth,” a poem resembling a 
lyrical ode to the body and the 
piano and a lover that contains 
moments of music such as “I 
was 
trying/to 
limber 
your 

shuffle, the muscle wired/to 
muscle” and “I wanted to be/a 
ghost because the skull is just 
a few holes/covered in meat,” 
as he ponders bodily motion 
as one observes and exists and 
lives out the poetic process and 
indulges in what Hayes refers to

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

‘August Snow’ presents 
lively testament to Detroit

It’s always a weird feeling 

to be reading a story set in 
an area one knows. For this 
reason, “August Snow” feels 
like an eerie walk through 
well-known 
areas 
near 

Ann Arbor. Set in Detroit’s 
Mexicantown area, mentions 
of the University of Michigan 
and Traverse City abound. The 
way it paints Detroit is one of 
the greatest joys of reading 
this book, leaving no stone 
unturned on the misfortunes of 
the city, but yet still sounding 
well and truly in love with the 
city, despite the flaws.

Following lead character 

August 
Snow, 
the 
novel 

carries the reader through a 
thrilling mystery as Grosse 
Pointe rich widower Eleanor 

Paget is murdered at her 
home. Despite August not 
being in the police service 
due to a long lawsuit that took 
place previous to the book’s 
arc, he feels morally obliged 
to investigate and uncover 
the truth, as he carries an 
inherent distrust of the police 
and Detroit politics.

“August 
Snow” 
is 
an 

absolute joy to read from 
start to finish; Stephen Mack 

Jones has infused a real love 
of Detroit into every page. 
Characters are full of life, with 
August being a modern day 
anti-hero to a T, burdened with 
responsibility he never asked 
for but with the moral compass 
to ensure that he gets the job 
done regardless. It’s almost a 
break of convention from the 
reluctant, mopey heros that 
many 
authors 

are 
turning 

to. 
August 
is 

a 
community 

leader, 
cares 

about his peers, 
and 
has 
been 

through a crazy 
life and yet still 
is 
thoughtful, 

polite, and a thrill to follow 
through his adventures from 
his viewpoint. This backstory 
is only alluded to throughout 
the plot, and helps to create 
a little intrigue in August; 
despite the book being written 
in first person, nothing is 
revealed clearly about August’s 
past.

One of the main themes 

of this book is the strong 
sense 
of 
community 
that 

August builds around himself 
throughout the plot. As a self-
described 
‘blaxican’ 
(Black 

father, 
Mexican 
mother), 

August attempts to balance 
both aspects of his heritage 
throughout the book. In several 
touching scenes, he attempts 
to 
help 
an 
undocumented 

immigrant family, surprising 
them by being able to speak 
Spanish when they are initially 
wary of him.

Despite being a crime drama, 

it’s these small little moments 
that really make the book 
stand out as something special. 
There’s such a wide range of 

background characters that 
crop up occasionally, and each 
time they’re more memorable 
than the last. A stoic FBI agent 
with a wry sense of humor, a 
lesbian couple who live in a 
mansion near Traverse City, 
and a couple of old ladies who 
wear odd knitted hats are just 
a few personal favorites.

Even at the story’s most 

stagnant 
moments, 
it 
is 

consistently 
saved 
by 
the 

high 
level 
of 

characterization. 
Later 
in 
the 

book, in the more 
action-oriented 
scenes, 
there 

is still enough good banter 
between the characters to 
ensure the story is not lost 
behind the occasional action 
sequence. In fact, nearly every 
seemingly small conversation 
that occurs seems to have some 
greater significance that may 
not reveal itself until several 
chapters later. On his journey 
to solve the murder, August 
talks to many people, however 
it is never clear until the very 
end of the book who it may 
have been. When the big reveal 
eventually happens, it’s almost 
a nonchalant thing, as the 
murder has taken the back seat 
to a darker secret.

Stephen Mack Jones has 

produced 
a 
lovable 
ode 

to 
Detroit 
and 
the 
many 

characters 
that 
live 
there, 

and although the plot is not 
groundbreaking by any means, 
the liveliness of the world he 
creates is something to behold. 
With a potential for more 
books about August, we can 
only hope this isn’t the last we 
see of him.

It’s these small 
little moments 
that really make 
the book stand out

‘Humans’ requires time

A recent trend in cable dramas 

has been taking several episodes 
to build their story. They take their 
time by unfolding ideas slowly 
until the plot explodes in the last 
couple hours of the season. Some 
showrunners have embraced this 
ability, especially on Netflix where 
dramas are meant to be binged in a 
short time frame. Only some shows 
are able to pull this off, however, 
because they have strength behind 
their themes that to allows them 
to unfold their story slowly. Shows 
like “The Americans” use time to 
build their characters and allow 
the tension to become palpable. 
AMC’s “Humans” tries to use this 

format, and so far it’s been able 
to pull it off. “Humans” tells a 
fascinating story, but its slow story 
rollout will undermine all that 
work without great payoffs.

“Humans” picks up a few 

months after the events of the 
season one finale. Niska (Emily 
Berrington, 
“24: 

Live 
Another 

Day”), 
hiding 

in 
Berlin 
after 

escaping with a 
block of code that 
can make robots 
sentient, 
releases 

the 
code 
and 

struggles to form a relationship 
with a girl she meets at a club 
(Bella Dayne, “The Man in the 
High Castle”). Since she released 
the code, Leo (Colin Morgan, “The 

Fall”) and Max (Ivanno Jeremiah, 
“The Veteran”) have been trying 
to track down the synths that have 
become sentient in order to protect 
them while Mia (Gemma Chan, 
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
Find Them”) starts to work for the 
owner of an ice cream shop. The 

Hawkins 
family 

tries to move on 
from 
Joe 
(Tom 

Goodman-Hill, 
“Mr. 
Selfridge”) 

cheating on his wife, 
Laura 
(Katherine 

Parkinson, 
“The 

Kennedys”), 
with 

Mia.

“Humans” 
is 
interested 

in dealing with deeper ideas 
surrounding how robots deserve 
to be treated, especially as they 
gain more human traits. In this 
world, robots are used for slave 
labor. They take on jobs as cooks, 
miners, 
factory 
workers 
and 

maids, among other occupations. 
They’re being used to fill out roles 
in the workforce more cheaply. 
(In fact, Joe is laid off from his 
managerial job in the premiere, 
and is replaced by a robot.) When 
the robots gain consciousness in 
the premiere, they escape their 
jobs to try and figure out what else 
is out there besides the holes they 
live and work in. Robots aren’t 
being treated like people, so when 
they do achieve sentience, there’s 
a moment when they realize what 
humans want their role to be. The 
robots struggle with this much 
more than the humans do, and it’s 
one of the driving factors behind 
Niska’s actions. These fascinating 
questions are at the core of the 
show, 
and 
inherently 
make 

“Humans” worth following.

“Humans” tells its story at a 

very deliberate pace, which has 
mixed results for the show as a 
whole. The premiere spends a lot 
of time starting to build its plans

MINNEAPOLIS 
— 
Down 

three with the final seconds 
ticking away, Duncan Robinson 
had nowhere to go.

The redshirt junior wing — 

one of Michigan’s most reliable 
3-point shooters — was double-
teamed behind the arc, and had 
no choice but to pass the ball to 
an open DJ Wilson positioned 
30-feet from the basket. 

With limited time and options, 

the redshirt sophomore forward 
could only square up and cue up 
his best stroke from well beyond 
the 3-point line in NBA range.

To the surprise of everyone in 

Williams Arena, Wilson’s shot 
found nothing but net.

It looked like Michigan would 

be able to grab momentum 
heading into overtime and turn 
its comeback into a memorable 
victory.

“It wasn’t drawn up for me at 

all,” Wilson said. “It was drawn 
up for (Robinson). They did a 

great job as far as running him 
off the line. I ran to the back of 
him, and he pitched it back. I 
thought about it for a second and 
looked at the clock and let it go, 
and it went in.”

But what may have been 

dubbed 
the 
“Miracle 
in 

Minnesota” wasn’t to be, as the 
Golden Gophers outscored the 
Wolverines 11-6 in the extra 
period to pull out the 83-78 win.

“Time and time again, this 

team has a resiliency about 
it,” said senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. “We thought once it 
got to overtime, the game was 
ours. We were making the right 
plays, and down the stretch, 
even though a lot of stuff didn’t 
go our way, we still got a chance 
to win.”

Junior guard Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman gave Michigan 
its only overtime lead with a 
3-pointer 1:42 into overtime, but 
he also missed two consecutive 
free throws with 1:40 remaining 
that 
would 
have 
put 
the 

Wolverines back on top.

Abdur-Rahkman’s 
misses 

encapsulated 
Michigan’s 

uncharacteristic struggles from 
the 
free-throw 
line 
Sunday 

night. The Wolverines shot just 
50 percent from the charity 
stripe despite entering the game 
with the second-
highest 
free-

throw percentage 
in the conference 
at 77.8 percent.

In 
a 
contest 

with 
18 
lead 

changes and eight 
ties, 
there 
was 

never a moment 
when 
either 

team felt it had 
fallen too far behind. But for a 
moment, Michigan’s coaching 
staff appeared to have lost its 
collective mind, and may have 
ultimately lost the Wolverines 
the game.

With 
4:39 
to 
go, 
senior 

forward Mark Donnal was called 
for a controversial defensive foul 
at the top of the key. In disbelief, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 

and his assistants appeared to 
have crossed the technical area 
while chasing after the referees 
for an explanation and were 
called for a technical foul.

Following 
the 
technical, 

Minnesota gained its biggest 

lead of the night 
— eight points — 
on a stretch that 
included four free 
throws 
directly 

after 
the 
call 

on 
Michigan’s 

sideline 
and 
a 

four-point play.

Michigan, 

though, 
showed 

no 
quit 
and 

continued to try and find a way to 
fight back, with Walton leading 
the way. Eight of Walton’s 16 
points came with under four 
minutes to play in regulation, as 
he once again attempted to will 
his team out of a deficit late in a 
game. He and Wilson combined 
to score 15 of Michigan’s final 17 
points in the fourth quarter to 
extend the game for another five 

minutes.

“Everybody on the team loves 

the moment,” Walton said. “The 
moment was there, so everybody 
wanted to step into it. I couldn’t 
be more happy for (Wilson) for 
making those big shots to even 
give us a fighting chance after so 
much didn’t go our way.”

In the extra period, Walton 

had 
the 
Wolverines’ 
best 

opportunity to send the game 
into a second overtime. With 
Michigan facing yet another 
three point deficit and the final 
seconds of the first overtime 
winding down, Walton had an 
open look from just beyond the 
arc.

His shot looked just as clean 

as Wilson’s, but it ended up 
rimming 
out 
with 
multiple 

Golden Gophers below the rim 
to grab the ensuing rebound. 
Minnesota made its free throws, 
and that was enough for the 
Golden Gophers to put away the 
Wolverines.

“Of course I wanted to take 

the shot, but it was about taking 

what the defense gave me,” 
Walton said. “Most of the guys 
were into (Wilson), so I had a 
clean look. It felt like one of the 
better shots I had taken all night. 
It rimmed out. That’s all I can 
say about it.”

With Michigan, Minnesota, 

Michigan 
State 
and 

Northwestern all emerging in 
recent weeks as contestants 
to fight for fourth place in the 
Big Ten and final double-bye 
in the conference tournament, 
Sunday’s game will go a long way 
in shaping that race.

Though Wilson’s heroics may 

have increased the Wolverines’ 
chances to get the win and pull 
into pole position, Michigan’s 
poor free-throw shooting was 
the loose string that led to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
undoing 
in 

Minneapolis.

“We wanted to win so bad and 

everybody showed that,” Walton 
said. “We showed a different 
type of resiliency and fight that I 
think we should carry over going 
forward.”

A Sunday at a crossroads

I

t’s impossible to encapsulate 
a season in one game, and 
there’s been plenty of good 

news for the Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team this 
year. The 
20th-ranked 
Wolverines 
are 21-7, one 
win shy of 
tying their 
all-time best 
mark. They’re 
a near-lock to 
secure their 
seventh NCAA Tournament 
bid. And on Sunday, against 
Michigan State at Crisler Center, 
they shattered their previous 
attendance record of 5,991 with 
an announced crowd of 12,707 
(though that figure measures 
tickets sold). 

Then came an image that 

might linger for a while: By 
the end of the afternoon, three 
sections of Michigan State fans 
were the only ones cheering in 
the Spartans’ 86-68 win.

In front of those fans, the 

Wolverines reached a crossroads: 
They saw how far they have 
come, and also how far they 
have to go. They played in front 
of a record-breaking crowd, yet 
they failed to match it with a 
result. They were undefeated 
both at home and when playing 
after a loss this season, yet they 
tarnished both of those marks. 
They played while ranked 
against an unranked Michigan 
State team for the first time this 
century, yet they couldn’t take 
advantage.

The crowd factor has always 

been a focal point for the 
Wolverines. The problem has 
been establishing that fan base. 
When she was hired in 2003, 
former coach Cheryl Burnett 
made the atmosphere at Crisler 
an immediate priority. Early 
in her first season, she told the 

Daily, “I believe that our support 
system — which is the crowd, the 
fans — can help us win games. 
I’ve seen it, I’ve experienced 
it and I believe it.” But the 
Wolverines couldn’t establish 
momentum, finishing 35-83 in 
Burnett’s four years.

Then, in 2010, after Kevin 

Borseth’s Michigan team routed 
Syracuse to win its 21st game 
and advance to the WNIT 
semifinals, Borseth said: “I’m 
hoping Wednesday we can really 
lure a lot of people out here. 
It’s going to be a great night 
obviously, because there’ll be not 
a lot on TV, not a lot going on. It’s 
a Wednesday, should be a great 
day for basketball to fill Crisler. I 
think our record is 5,500, I think 
we can get 13 grand. I would 

love to see that.” Michigan drew 
2,456 and lost by 17.

Kim Barnes Arico was next 

at the helm, and she arguably 
has the program in better shape 
than it has ever been. Two years 
ago, after the Wolverines’ season 
ended in the WNIT semifinals 
before an announced crowd of 
2,209, Barnes Arico thanked the 
fans for what she called the “best 
atmosphere I’ve been a part of 
since I came here.”

She said that again Sunday — 

calling it the best atmosphere of 
her career except for her trips 
to powerhouse Connecticut 
while at St. John’s — and it was 
legitimate. The best team in 
program history drew the best 
crowd in program history.

Everything after that went 

south.

For a day, Michigan eased 

its problem of low attendance. 
But there was another hex the 
Wolverines couldn’t break — 
their struggles against Michigan 
State.

They are now 18-66 against 

their rivals from East Lansing, 
4-27 in the last 31 meetings and 
4-18 against Spartans coach Suzy 
Merchant.

“I always talk about, from 

the first time we played them, 
they’ve been the team in the 
state,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They’ve been the benchmark. 
They’ve been the program. They 
have had tradition. We’ve tried to 
learn from them, and we’ve tried 
to grow from where our program 
was.”

The Wolverines have always 

struggled to match their 
rivals in building a program. 
Michigan State boasts 13 
NCAA Tournament berths to 
Michigan’s six and three Sweet 
Sixteens to Michigan’s zero.

Over the past eight years 

entering this season, Michigan’s 
highest attendance average was 
2,593. Michigan State’s lowest 
was 5,844, and the Spartans 
ranked in the top 10 in the 
country in six of those years.

It’s a difficult gap to bridge, 

and it’s hard to build a program 
in women’s basketball because 
of the margin between the top 
tier and everyone else. No. 1 
Connecticut has both of the 
two longest winning streaks in 
college sports history.

But the Wolverines have 

made progress. Their record this 
season speaks for itself, they are 
generating more buzz and Barnes 
Arico pointed out that Michigan 
beat out Michigan State for top 
recruit Kysre Gondrezick out of 
Benton Harbor, Mich.

Sunday was a reminder that 

these transformations don’t 
happen overnight.

“What happens is, once 

you start winning a little bit, 
everybody expects you to win 
every one,” Barnes Arico said. 
“It was funny, we lost at Indiana 
(on Thursday) and we came 
home and it was like the world 
had come to an end, around Ann 
Arbor, around the office. It was 
like, ‘What happened? What 
happened?’

“I was like, ‘Golly, we’re not 

Connecticut. We’re probably 
not going to win every one, and 
coming into the year, those 
weren’t the expectations. But 
once you start winning, those 
expectations significantly 
change.”

Sunday’s loss may sting for 

a while, in part because of 
those new expectations. It was 
Michigan’s second-most lopsided 
loss of the year, its first in 14 
games at home and its first back-
to-back defeat as well.

Now Barnes Arico must 

manage those expectations. She 
said after the game it’s important 
for her team to stay confident. 
She told star guard Katelynn 
Flaherty — who shot 2-for-12 and 
scored four points, her lowest 
total since Feb. 28, 2015 — to keep 
her head up. Barnes Arico knows 
that, at third place in the Big 
Ten, her team is still in a good 
position, if a new one as well.

“Uncharted territory,” she 

said, “for sure.”

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico has moved the program forward since taking over in 2012, but Sunday was an indication of progress that still needs to be made.

The good, the bad and the ugly

Amid a crowd of 12,707 – a sold-

out crowd at Crisler Center – be-
speckled with maize, blue, green 
and white, the No. 20 Michigan 
women’s basketball team fell to 
Michigan State (8-6, 19-9) in the 
second-to-last home game of the 
regular season.

Despite a two-game losing 

streak — to Indiana and now the 
Spartans — Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico isn’t bending under 
the pressure. 

“Once you start winning, every-

body expects you to win every 
one,” Barnes Arico said. “We’re 
not going to win every one, and 
coming into the year those weren’t 
the expectations. But once you 
start winning, those expectations 
significantly change.” 

Added sophomore guard Nicole 

Munger: “We’re not afraid of hard 
work, and that’s what this week is 
going to be about. Get ready for a 
big bounce-back.” 

The Wolverines battled through 

seven-lead changes throughout 
the game and managed a 43-42 
Michigan lead going into half-
time. They used scoring-runs by 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
(21 total points), freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick (19), freshman 
forward Kayla Robbins (8) and 
Munger (12) to try to power past 
Michigan State. 

But, ultimately, a poor defensive 

showing and a dominant Spartan 
guard, Tori Jankoska, led to the 
Wolverines’ downfall. 

The Daily breaks down where 

Michigan stands after this week-
end’s performance. 

The good 
The Wolverines (10-4 Big Ten, 

21-7 overall) reached the 20-win 
mark faster than any other season 
in program history. And, if the team 
wins its upcoming games against 
both Nebraska and Penn State, 
Michigan could still tie for most-
ever wins in a season, reached only 
in 1999-2000 and 2012-2013.

The fan base is noticing the 

upward trend of the Wolverines, 
and proved it by breaking the pre-
vious record for tickets sold by 
more than 200 percent. 

“That was probably the best 

atmosphere I’ve ever been a part 
of,” Barnes Arico said. “If I could 
just thank the Michigan fans and 
the crowd today, it was incredible 
…That was a really unbelievable, 
incredible atmosphere.

“My first year here it was a great 

crowd, and it was mostly green, 
which was horrible. But today, it 
was mostly maize and blue, and it 
was unbelievable.” 

Other good looks included 

“spark plugs” like Munger, who 
was used in the last half of every 
period to push past deficits. 
Munger sunk 12 points, grabbed 
five rebounds and contributed an 
assist in 21 minutes of play-time. 

“I love coming in and playing 

’12,’ that’s our defense that I’m at 
the top at,” Munger said. “Even if 
it is just for a couple minutes, (I’m) 
bringing that spurt of energy.”

The bad
Even with this weekend’s loss, 

the Wolverines are still two games 
ahead of both the Spartans and the 
Hoosiers, who trail them in the 
Big Ten rankings. Michigan is still 
poised to notch a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament, something Michigan 
State is vying for with intensity.

“Everybody might be, ‘What’s 

going on? You just lost two games 
back-to-back,’ ” Barnes Arico said. 
“But we lost two games against 
two really good teams, and I think 
it’s important for our program at 
this state to remain positive and 
to keep our confidence and to con-
tinue to try to practice to improve 
everyday.” 

But, Michigan is facing pres-

sure to perform in these next two 
games to keep its spot open. Any 
major dip and its chances at a spot 
in the tournament for the first 
time since Barnes Arico’s first year 
here could be in jeopardy. 

The ugly 
Defensively, the Wolverines 

had trouble staying strong. In 
two instances, Michigan State 
trumped Michigan’s efforts to 
keep afloat. The first was a 14-4 
run in the first half of the third 
quarter – typically, a strong por-
tion of the Wolverines’ game – and 
the second was a 19-10 success in 
the final period. 

Added to that was junior guard 

Katelynn 
Flaherty’s 
inability 

to reach the rim. With just four 

points, Flaherty’s typical presence 
on the court was missed. 

“I think teams have scouted us,” 

Barnes Arico said. “I think the last 
couple games we played against 
teams that are pretty good teams. 
So they are in Katelynn Flaherty’s 
– she didn’t, I don’t think, she got 
an easy look at all tonight. I thought 
she had to work for everything. So 
we got to, as a program, as coaches, 
try to get her some easier looks.” 

Jankoska 
befuddled 
the 

defense using a “right-to-left, 
behind-the-back 
crossover, 

step-back for a ‘3,’ ” according to 
Munger. Despite the Wolverines’ 
best efforts, the Spartan was 
impenetrable in her approach to 
the basket. 

“I keep using the term ‘get bet-

ter,’ because there’s a lot of differ-
ent things we got to get better on.” 
Munger said. “I think our one-on-
one defense has been pretty poor 
the past couple of days. In practice, 
the past few days, we really focused 
on that and I think we got better at 
it. Michigan State just did a great 
job of hitting shots today. Really 
hard shots. We were contesting 
them, but that’s no excuse because 
we need to get right up next to them 
and make it a harder shot for them.” 

‘M’ drops first home game

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team was well aware 
that 
its 

matchup 
against 
Michigan 
State would have an intensity 
unlike anything it has seen this 
season.

On top of the storied in-state 

rivalry, the Wolverines sought 
to 
break 
their 
attendance 

record 
at 
Crisler 
Center. 

Michigan fulfilled that goal 
and then some, more than 
doubling its previous record 
of 5,991 fans set in 2011, with 
12,707 attendees on Sunday.

Unfortunately, the energy 

from the crowd wasn’t enough 
for the Wolverines (10-4 Big 
Ten, 21-7 overall), as they 
ultimately couldn’t keep up 
with 
the 
Spartans’ 
potent 

offense, falling 86-68. The 
loss to Michigan State (8-6, 
18-9) ended Michigan’s perfect 
home record — the team had 
won its previous 13 contests 
in Ann Arbor this season. It 
was also the Wolverines’ worst 

3-point shooting performance 
of the season, going a paltry 
3-for-17 
behind 
the 
arc, 

with usual 3-point specialist 
Katelynn Flaherty scoring just 
four points.

“We’re trying not to live 

and die by the three because 
we have an inside presence 
with Hallie (Thome),” said 
sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 

Munger. “Today we weren’t 
making them and they were, 
but we can’t let that control 
our effort on defense and other 
facets of the game.”

In 
the 
first 
quarter, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
was 

attacked 
early 
and 
often. 

Despite 
Thome 
scoring 

the Wolverines’ first eight 
points, 
the 
Spartans 
were 

nearly 
indefensible, 
hitting 

six of their first seven shots. 
Michigan State forward Tori 
Jankoska, in particular, shot a 
perfect 5-for-5 from the floor 
to tally 13 points — 28 for the 
game — and put her team up, 
26-18, at the end of the quarter.

“To be able to set the tone 

for defense and offense, I think 
that starts with me,” Jankoska 
said. “I like to be able to do that 
for the team in the first quarter 
especially.”

Added Michigan State coach 

Suzy Merchant: “To come out 
with that intensity with Tori 
- she’s our energy guy. When 
she’s making shots good things 
are going to happen.”

Freshman 
forward 
Kayla 

Robbins, 
who 
has 
played 

sparingly in Big Ten play, was 
a welcome sight in the first 
frame for Michigan, as she 
scored eight straight points 
after Thome’s run for the 
Wolverines. The two were the 
only Michigan players to score 
in the opening quarter.

Eager to right the ship in 

front of the team’s largest home 
crowd ever, the Wolverines 
began the second quarter with 
a 3-pointer and a breakaway 
layup courtesy of sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 
Munger 
and 

freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, respectively.

The 
Spartans 
continued 

their torrid scoring pace, but 

were unable to generate any 
offense in the paint. Low post 
pressure forced a number of 
turnovers and off-balance shots 
inside, and the Wolverines 
capitalized. Gondrezick went 
off for 13 points and two steals 
to spark Michigan’s comeback 
effort. The Wolverines hit six 
of their final eight field goals 
to retake the lead, 43-42, going 
into halftime.

But the real story at the 

half was Michigan’s defense. 
The Wolverines were winning 
the turnover battle, 11-4, and 
held Jankoska scoreless in the 
second quarter to make up for 
her outburst in the first.

The game of runs wasn’t 

over, though. After trading 
baskets to begin the second 
half, the Spartans used a 10-0 
swing to take a nine-point lead 
that would quickly balloon to a 
13-point deficit for Michigan. 
Baskets by Munger and Thome 
ate 
into 
Michigan 
State’s 

advantage, but seven third-
quarter turnovers ultimately 
plagued the Wolverines, as 
they were down by nine going 
into the final frame.

“Once they went back to 

full strength at the start of the 
third, we didn’t adjust well 
and they got the lead,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “At this stage of the 
game, people are (going to) 
know what you’re gonna do 
and we’ve gotta execute.”

From there, the Spartans’ 

offensive onslaught continued, 
and Michigan shot just 3-for-
14 to compensate. Despite the 
record number of Wolverine 
fans 
in 
attendance, 
the 

Michigan 
State 
contigent 

overpowered Crisler Center 
with chants of “Go Green! Go 
White!” early in the quarter 
with the Spartans up by a 
decisive margin.

The 
loss 
exposed 
the 

Wolverines’ vulnerability to 
talented Big Ten foes, and 
they now have just two games 
remaining 
in 
the 
regular 

season to get back on track 
after dropping back-to-back 
games for the first time this 
season.

Wolverines repeat as Big Ten champions

As soon as it became official, 

28 members of the Michigan 
women’s swimming and diving 
team 
— 
donning 
Big 
Ten 

Champion baseball caps and 
T-shirts — hurled themselves into 
the diving well at Boilermaker 
Aquatic Center on Saturday night. 
Coach Mike Bottom followed suit, 
entering the water emphatically 
with a victorious front-flip. When 
the Wolverines began to sing 
a splash-filled version of “The 
Victors,” reality set in — Michigan 
had just won back-to-back Big 
Ten Championships.

“I don’t swim like I used to 

swim,” Bottom laughed. “But 
I float a lot better than I used to 
float.”

After 
sophomore 
Siobhan 

Haughey was disqualified in the 
200-yard IM final on Thursday 
night 
after 
touching 
first, 

Michigan’s chances at repeating 
looked bleak. The Wolverines, 
who would have been in first 
place if Haughey had won, sat in 
third going into the final two days 
of the meet — trailing Indiana by 
30.

But No. 6 Michigan was up for 

the challenge.

“I looked at the team and 

basically said, ‘Hey, what are we 
gonna do about this?’” Bottom 
said. “They responded very well 
the next day. We had incredible 
swims — we had one of the best 
mornings I think this Michigan 
program has ever seen.”

The Wolverines recorded 47 

career bests and 10 new school 
records en route to winning 
their 16th Big Ten title. It marked 
the first time the team took 
home 
consecutive 
conference 

championships since the 1997-98 
seasons. Michigan finished the 
meet with 1,287 points, while 
Indiana placed second with 1,125 
points and Wisconsin rounded 
out the top three with 1,101.5 
points.

Michigan was aided by top-

notch performances when it 
needed them most. Junior G Ryan 
had a dominant showing, tasting 
victory in the 500-yard freestyle, 
1,650-yard freestyle and 800-yard 

freestyle relay.

“I was really just determined to 

score as many points as I could for 
Michigan, that was what I came 
here to do,” Ryan said. “The 500 
and the mile were great because I 
could see my team on the side of 
the pool, so every time I breathed 
that way I knew that I had the 
team behind me.”

In the 200-yard freestyle, 

Haughey defended her Big Ten 
title, posting school, Big Ten and 
Big Ten Championship records 
with a time of 1:42.49. The 
sophomore picked up second 
place in the 100-yard freestyle as 
well.

Junior Clara Smiddy — the 

defending Big Ten champion in 
the 100-yard backstroke — placed 
second in both the 100-yard and 
200-yard 
backstroke 
events, 

while freshman Vanessa Krause 
touched second and third in the 
200-yard and 100-yard butterfly 
events, respectively. Junior Emily 
Kopas set a school record in the 
100-yard 
breaststroke 
(59.54), 

finishing fifth in the event.

From start to finish, relays 

played an integral role in the 
Wolverines’ scoring. Michigan 
kicked off competition with a win 
in the 800-yard freestyle relay 
(sophomore Yirong Bi, Haughey, 

junior Gabby DeLoof, Ryan), 
breaking school, Big Ten and Big 
Ten Championship records. In the 
400-yard medley relay (Smiddy, 
Kopas, Krause, Haughey), the 
Wolverines set yet another school 
record and claimed third. To close 
out the meet, Michigan placed 
second in the 400-yard freestyle 
relay (sophomore Catie DeLoof, 
Haughey, 
sophomore 
Becca 

Postoll, Gabby DeLoof).

On the boards, senior Keegan 

McCaffrey took home 13th in 
the one-meter diving event, 
while freshman Kristen Hayden 
and senior Allie Murphy placed 
16th and 21st, respectively. 
Hayden 
finished 
11th 
and 

McCaffrey finished 19th in 
the three-meter event. In the 
platform diving finals, junior 
Dani VanderZwaag, Murphy 
and McCaffrey placed 11th, 12th 
and 13th, respectively.

“Our divers scored a lot of 

points,” Bottom said. “On this last 
night when we knew we had to 
beat Indiana, all five of our divers 
scored. That was huge.”

For Michigan’s seniors, it was 

certainly an exciting way to finish 
their Big Ten careers. Seniors 
Maddy Frost, Madison Horton, 
Celia Keany and Julia Fiks Salem 
all made finals in at least one of 

their events.

“It was fun to see our senior 

leadership — who have not always 
been the leaders in the water 
because they weren’t the best 
of swimmers — all score today,” 
Bottom said.

But the Wolverines’ success did 

not come easy. When Michigan 
was just about counted out with 
two 
days 
remaining, 
coach 

Bottom delivered one simple 
message to the team.

“We 
talked 
about 

understanding who we are — 
using the emotions, whatever 
the emotions are … to move us 
forward as champions,” Bottom 
said.

Added Ryan: “He talked to us 

about belief — belief in each other 
and what we’re capable of — and 
we never let go of that and that’s 
why we ended up champions 
tonight.”

But for Ryan and many others, 

the magnitude of a conference 
championship still has not set in.

“It hasn’t processed at all 

yet,” Ryan said. “It’s amazing — 
that much I know right now. It’s 
incredible to watch this team 
grow even more year after year.

“It’s an honor to be able to say 

that we’re the best in the Big Ten 
this year.”

‘M’ falls in Madison

MADISON 
— 
With 
just 

under nine minutes left, it 
looked 
as 

though the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 
might 
be 
gaining 
some 

momentum against No. 20 
Wisconsin (10-4 Big Ten, 17-10-
1 overall) — the Wolverines had 
gained a lead in shots while the 
score sat tied at four.

But 
any 
semblance 
of 

momentum was halted when 
Wisconsin 
forward 
Will 

Johnson fired a shot toward 
the net that Badger defenseman 
Peter Tischke tipped into the 
net for the game-winning goal 
en route to a 6-4 victory.

It was a high-scoring game, 

and the goal-scoring started 
almost immediately.

Wisconsin 
forward 
Luke 

Kunin controlled the opening 
faceoff and shot it into the 
Michigan zone. Fellow Badger 
forward Matt Ustaski reached 
the puck first and passed it up 
to forward Trent Frederic, who 
beat Michigan goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort just eight seconds 
into the game.

The Wolverines (2-10-2-2, 

9-16-3) didn’t stay down for 
long, though.

Just 35 seconds later, junior 

forward 
Tony 
Calderone 

corralled the puck behind the 
net. He then passed it back in 
front of Wisconsin goaltender 
Matt Jurusik, where freshman 
forward James Sanchez was 
waiting to tie the score at 1-1.

“No one wants to see us get 

scored on so fast, or in general, 
for that matter,” said junior 
forward Cutler Martin. “… I 
think it was the next shift, we 
bounced back, scored a goal. 
That got us back up on our feet, 
back into the game.”

The teams would go back 

and forth to end the first 
period, with Martin scoring 
one himself for Michigan and 
Frederic tallying another one 
for the Badgers.

In the second period, a 

nice individual effort from 
Wisconsin 
forward 
Aidan 

Callini put the Badgers back 
on top. But once again, the 
Wolverines answered back.

This time, it was junior 

forward Joseph Cecconi, who 
ripped one from the blue line to 
beat Jurusik high to his glove 
side, evening the score at 3-3. It 
was the first goal of Cecconi’s 
career, and after a somewhat 
subdued 
celebration, 
the 

sophomore collected the puck 
for himself.

“I’m not a big goal scorer,” 

Cecconi said. “If I score, 
when I do score, I’m not going 
to go down and do the nice 
celebration like some of the 
forwards do. I’ve been there 
before, like any other hockey 
player, so I was excited. It was 
awesome to get the first one.

“(The puck) is in my bag right 

now. I think I’ll probably give it 
to my dad when I get home, or 
my grandpa or something like 
that.”

In the third period, there was 

more back-and-forth action. 
After Wisconsin defenseman 
Jake Linhart scored a goal off 
his leg, freshman defenseman 
Luke Martin handled the puck 
at the Wisconsin blue line. He 
fired a somewhat slow shot 
toward Jurusik, and freshman 
forward 
Adam 
Winborg 

deflected it into the net to tie it 
up at 4-4.

“I thought we played a pretty 

good game,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “I’m tired 
of saying it with the result 
that we’re getting. We can’t 
outscore our mistakes. We’re 
doing a lot of good things. We 
missed some chances — even in 
the last minute, before they got 
the empty net goal, Sanchez has 
a rebound chance. If that goes 
in, the game’s tied up again.

“But that’s what we’re doing. 

We’re chasing our mistakes, 
and we weren’t good enough.”

After 
a 
disappointing 

weekend against the Badgers, 
Michigan 
will 
travel 
to 

Columbus to take on No. 14 
Ohio 
State 
next 
weekend 

looking to right the ship once 
again.

Michigan’s improvements
not enough to top Badgers

MADISON — Eight seconds 

into Saturday’s game, Wisconsin 
forward Trent Frederic scored. 
After that, it was a game of catch 
up. 

Two Michigan forwards — 

freshman James Sanchez and 
junior Cutler Martin — each 
scored a goal afterward to put 
the Wolverines’ hockey team in 
the lead. And then the Badgers 
scored two goals, and Michigan 
scored one of its own, and on 
it went until Wisconsin finally 
claimed the game at the end of 
the third period, 6-4.

It was the Badgers’ second win 

of the weekend, sweeping the 
Wolverines (2-10-2-2 Big Ten, 
9-16-3 overall) with a similar 5-2 
win on Friday.

Both losses were tough to 

absorb. 
Despite 
the 
sweep, 

though, 
certain 
aspects 
of 

Michigan’s 
game 
appeared 

better this weekend than it has 
in the past.

“We did some good things 

and we have to 
keep 
building 

on 
the 
good 

things,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Red 
Berenson. 

“And we’ve got 
to eliminate the 
not-so-good 
things. … Our 
mistakes are too 
costly. I don’t 
think 
we’re 

playing high-risk hockey, I think 
we’re playing the right way. 
Right now we’re just not good 
enough.

“We’re not deep enough, we’re 

not good enough, and defensively 
it’s showing up. I mean, we 
scored four goals on the road. 
Most years that’s going to win 
you a game, but not this year.”

In a season in which the 

Wolverines had established an 
unfavorable early trend of being 
outshot by the majority of their 
opponents, the past few weeks 
have 
shown 
improvement. 

On 
Saturday, 

Michigan 
outshot 
Wisconsin 
38-29. 
Last 

Friday, it outshot 
Michigan State, 
31-19. And the 
Friday 
before, 

it topped Ohio 
State 
with 
38 

shots compared 
to the Buckeyes’ 
29.

It’s not perfect and it isn’t 

happening 
every 
game. 
But 

in comparison to earlier in 
the season, when the Badgers 
outshot the Wolverines 41-21 
and 35-19, or when then-No. 6 
Penn State outshot them 58-23 
and 48-29, it’s definitely an 
improvement.

The youth of the team has 

proven to be imperative to the 

team’s 
growth, 

as the freshman 
forward duo of 
Jake Slaker and 
Will 
Lockwood 

are No. 1 and 
No. 
2 
on 
the 

team in points, 
respectively. 
Lockwood 
is 

also second in 
goals with seven, 
while Slaker is in 

a three-way tie for third with six.

Special 
teams 
have 
also 

improved for Michigan. At the 
beginning of the year, its penalty 
kill was ranked, but that ranking 
has since fallen. The decline 
came to a low-point two weeks 
ago when the Wolverines faced 
No. 11 Ohio State and gave up 
seven power-play goals over 

the course of two games. But 
this weekend, the penalty kill 
stepped back up, allowing only a 
single power-play goal.

“Special 
teams, 
we 
were 

good,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“The 

power play was 
pretty good. The 
penalty 
killing 

was pretty good. 
They’ve 
got 
a 

dangerous power 
play, they ended 
up scoring, but 
they’re 
going 

to 
get 
their 

chances. 
I 

thought it was a 
step forward for 

our special teams.”

But even with improvements, 

Michigan still isn’t recording 
wins. Turnovers and defensive 
lapses marred the Wolverines’ 
performances this weekend and 
left them struggling to catch up 
with the Badgers in a lopsided 
back-and-forth series.

And consistency hasn’t been 

friendly to Michigan this year, 
providing yet another hurdle for 
the team to overcome before it 
can tally any additional wins.

Overall, the past weekend 

provided 
insight 
into 
the 

progress the Wolverines have 
made this season. They’re better 
than they have been — but 
they’re still not good enough to 
record their first sweep of the 
season.

“I thought we played a pretty 

good game, and I’m tired of 
saying it with the result we’re 
getting,” Berenson said. “We 
can’t outscore our mistakes. 
We did a lot of good things, we 
missed some chances we needed 
in the last minute before they got 
the empty-net goal. Sanchez had 
a rebound chance. If that goes 
in, the game is tied up again. But 
that’s what we’re doing, we’re 
chasing our mistakes.”

Wolverines go 3-1 in Raleigh

In its first game on Saturday 

against Notre Dame, the No. 11 
Michigan softball team simply 
was not playing good softball. As 
the Fighting Irish set the tone 
with a three-run homer in the top 
of the first, the Wolverines played 
an unfortunate game of catch-
up that did not come to fruition, 
stranding 15 runners on base 
along the way to a 6-4 loss.

But Sunday was a new day for 

Michigan.

The 
Wolverines 
settled 

the score, taking a 9-2 victory 
over the Fighting Irish with a 
complete team effort. Michigan 
notched double the amount of 
hits as Notre Dame with 12 and 
six, respectively. It saw home 
runs from four separate players 
and a 4-for-4 performance at 
the plate from senior shortstop 
Abby Ramirez. But in the circle, 
the efforts of junior right-hander 
Tera Blanco proved essential 
in neutralizing Notre Dame’s 
offensive command.

“In 
(Sunday’s) 
game, 
she 

pitched with purpose and with 
confidence,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “I hope that she 
continues to gain confidence 
because a confident Tera Blanco, 
that’s what we’re striving for.”

Blanco emerged as a force 

to be reckoned with, going 2-0 
in the circle and allowing just 
two runs in 12 innings pitched 
at the ACC/Big Ten Challenge 
this weekend in Raleigh, N.C. 
Despite their sole loss to Notre 
Dame, the Wolverines (6-3) found 
their rhythm at the tournament, 
routing North Carolina State in 
12-0 and 11-0 run-rule shutouts on 
Friday and Saturday, respectively. 
And after exacting revenge on the 
Fighting Irish Sunday morning, 
Michigan finished the weekend 
with a winning record, 3-1.

The Wolverines covered their 

bases with both Blanco and 
senior right-hander Megan Betsa 
frequently finding the efficiency 

and consistency they wanted at the 
mound. The offense also heated up 
dramatically, launching 10 home 
runs on the weekend compared to 
Michigan’s lone homer during its 
opening weekend. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
burst 
of 

offensive 
production 
can 
be 

attributed to their main focus 
in practice last week: timing. In 
the past week, Michigan focused 
on relaxing and being loose at 
practice, as the team was a bit 
bogged down and tight after 
opening weekend. It all seemed to 
pay dividends for the Wolverines.

“We’re really just taking the 

game and making it simple,” 
Blanco said. “We’re playing loose 
and having fun.”

Michigan began its success 

against the Wolfpack on Friday 
when 
senior 
center 
fielder 

Kelly Christner stole the show. 
Christner blasted a trio of homers 
— the fourth Wolverine in history 
to do so in a single game — and 
set a career-high with seven runs 
batted in, boosting her batting 
average to .556 in the process.

“(Christner) was on fire that 

game,” Hutchins said. “She really 
resonated with some of the timing 
things we had done in practice 
throughout the week.”

Taking advantage of an early 

lead, Michigan tallied nine runs 
in the first two innings, and 
NC State could never recover. 
Senior third baseman Lindsay 
Montemarano 
and 
junior 

designated player Aidan Falk 
each had a home run apiece, with 
Montemarano’s notably driving 
in three runs.

Betsa allowed only one hit in 

the shutout against the Wolfpack, 
while 
striking 
out 
nine. 

Sophomore right-hander Leah 
Crockett made an appearance in 
the circle for the fifth and final 
inning, earning two strikeouts 
of her own. Saturday morning 
against 
Notre 
Dame, 
Betsa 

continued with a high strikeout 
count of 11, but gave up six hits 
and two walks, including two 
homers. 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

struggles were highlighted in 
the bottom of the sixth when the 
Wolverines had no outs and the 
bases loaded, yet were unable to 
capitalize. 

Michigan 
returned 
to 
its 

groove 
after 
the 
frustrating 

morning, delivering the Wolfpack 
a similar fate as the previous day 
with a run-rule shutout. The 
Wolverines completely controlled 
the game, tallying 13 hits and 
scoring 11 runs.

Saturday afternoon, Blanco, 

who pitched the full game, didn’t 
let her appearance in the circle 
stop her from succeeding at the 
plate. The hurler went 3-for-3 and 
earned two RBI on the day. 

With the bases loaded in the 

fifth and the score at 7-0 in favor 
of Michigan, sophomore second 
baseman Faith Canfield needed 
only one RBI to secure the run-
rule victory. Instead, Canfield 
crushed a grand slam over the 
leftfield wall — the first of her 
career — ending the game, 11-0.

Canfield carried her power 

hitting 
into 
Sunday’s 
game, 

delivering a two-run homer in her 
first at-bat in the top of the first. 
Falk and sophomore catcher Alex 
Sobczak hit back-to-back home 
runs in the second, and junior 
pinch hitter Amanda Vargas hit 
the Wolverines’ fourth long ball 
of the day in the seventh inning 
to close out the tournament in a 
satisfying fashion.

Though 
largely 
pleased 

with 
Michigan’s 
performance 

this weekend, Hutchins views 
Saturday’s loss to Notre Dame 
as problematic — the Wolverines 
left runners stranded on third 
base in six of seven innings — 
a consequential concern. As a 
result, upcoming practices will 
focus on taking advantage of 
runners in scoring position before 
next weekend’s Mary Nutter 
Classic in Palm Springs, Calif.

“We 
need 
timely 
hitting 

when it appears to be a pressure 
situation,” Hutchins said. “That 
will be what we work on this 
week — just being clutch.”

Trouble at the line dooms Michigan

MINNEAPOLIS 
— 

Uncharacteristic.

That’s how Michigan coach 

John Beilein described the 
Wolverines’ performance from 
the free-throw line. It was also 
how both redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson and senior 
guard 
Derrick 
Walton 
Jr. 

described it.

It was that kind of night for 

the Michigan basketball team 
(7-7 Big Ten, 17-10 overall), as 
it shot just 50 percent (9-for-
18) from the charity stripe.

It was an overall dismal 

performance 
for 
a 
usually 

good 
free-throw 
shooting 

team — the Wolverines are 
ranked No. 4 in the NCAA 
with a 78.9 percent conversion 
rate — as Michigan was dealt a 
crushing 83-78 overtime loss to 
Minnesota (8-6, 20-7) Sunday 
afternoon at Williams Arena.

“It was very uncharacteristic 

of us to go 9-for-18 at the foul 
line,” Beilein said. “That was a 
big point in the game.”

Added 
Wilson: 
“It 
was 

uncharacteristic of us to miss 
those 
free 

throws 
down 

the stretch. I 
think we shot 
50 percent, and 
we’re one of the 
leaders in the 
country as far 
as 
free-throw 

shooting, 
so 
that’s 
no 

excuse.”

And 
like 

Wilson 
said, 

it was at the 
most crucial times in the game 
that the Wolverines failed to 
convert from the line. 

With 1:40 left in overtime, 

junior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rakhman went to the 
charity stripe to shoot two 
with Michigan down by one.

The junior guard put up 

the first shot. The ball hit the 
inside of the bucket before 
rimming out.

Abdur-Rakhman 
didn’t 

have much luck on his second 
shot either, as the ball rimmed 
out once again, wasting a big 
opportunity for Michigan to at 
least tie the game.

Earlier in the game, senior 

guard Derrick 
Walton 
Jr. 

missed 
three 

straight 
free 

throws 
— 

including 
the 

front end of a 
one-and-one 
— to cast away 
the possibility 
of 
putting 

Michigan 
ahead 
with 

less 
than 
10 

minutes left in 
regulation.

After 
the 
game, 
Walton 

had 
no 
answers 
for 
why 

the 
Wolverines’ 
free-throw 

shooting 
was 
off 
Sunday 

afternoon.

“Just a very uncharacteristic 

tonight when I miss three 

big 
critical 

free 
throws,” 

Walton 
said. 

“Muhammad 
missed 
two 

big 
ones, 
and 

then 
(junior 

wing 
Duncan 

Robinson), out of 
all of us, missed 
one. It’s just one 
of those games 
where you can’t 
really 
describe 

what’s going on.

“We 
just 
couldn’t 
make 

them. A lot of them rimmed 
out halfway down the basket, 
and they just came out. I don’t 
think anybody changed their 
routine, and everybody shot it 
to make it, of course, but the 
ball just didn’t go in.”

While Michigan struggled 

from the free-throw line down 
the stretch, the performance 
was 
in 
stark 
contrast 
to 

Minnesota’s night from the 
charity stripe.

The 
Golden 
Gophers 

struggled early, making just 
5-of-12 free throws in the first 
half. But Minnesota improved 
down the stretch, hitting 15 

of its last 16 
free throws to 
increase a lead 
that 
Michigan 

couldn’t 
come 

back from.

“It’s 
cliché, 

but they don’t 
seem to get too 
high or too low,” 
said Minnesota 
coach 
Richard 

Pitino 
of 

his 
team’s 

resiliency. 

“They’re a very mentally tough 
group.”

But while the ball didn’t roll 

Michigan’s way either from 
the charity stripe or at the end 
of the game, when Walton’s 
potential game-tying 3-pointer 
at the end of overtime rimmed 
out, there were some positives.

Mainly, the fact that the 

Wolverines were still in the 
game despite their struggles 
from 
the 
free-throw 
line 

against a top-25 RPI team.

“For me, it adds an little 

extra boost of confidence to 
know that we’re missing these 
free throws and we’re still in 
the game down the stretch,” 
Wilson said.

While Michigan’s loss at 

Minnesota won’t push them off 
the NCAA Tournament bubble 
— a conference loss on the road 
to a top-25 RPI team shouldn’t 
do that — there will come a 
time when the Wolverines will 
need to hit clutch free throws.

And the implications will 

be much larger than they were 
Sunday night in Minneapolis. 

Wolverines split opening weekend

The 
Michigan 
baseball 

team kicked off its preseason 
tournament against Seton Hall 
this weekend in a four-game 
bout, with the frenetic weekend 
ending in a 2-2 split. The series 
was highlighted by two games in 
which a single run decided the 
outcome. 

“Close 
games 
are 
always 

decided by one play, one pitch, 
one swing,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “It seemed to be 
back and forth, there was no quit 
in either team.”

Junior left-hander Michael 

Hendrickson took the mound for 
the preseason finale that ended 
in disappointment in the top half 
of the last inning. The match 
followed a 10-7 victory earlier 
in the day over the Pirates in a 
continuation of the previously 
delayed game. 

The Wolverines got off to a 

slow start, as Seton Hall earned 
three hits that culminated in 
two runs in the second inning. 
Responding 
quickly 
in 
the 

bottom of the second, senior 
catcher 
Harrison 
Wenson 

tripled, and was driven in from 
an RBI groundout from senior 
shortstop Michael Brdar to tack 
on a run shortly after.

Sophomore second baseman 

Ako 
Thomas 
started 
the 

offensive engine, though, in the 
bottom of the third inning with a 
single, before eventually stealing 
third base. Junior first baseman 
Jake Bivens reached first on a 
walk, and redshirt sophomore 
left fielder Miles Lewis drove 
him in on an RBI single. 

Lewis 
and 
junior 
third 

baseman Drew Lugbauer would 
score in the same inning on back-
to-back RBIs to give Michigan a 
5-2 lead.

Heading into the ninth inning, 

the Wolverines led 6-3 due to a 
run from Thomas off a Bivens 
RBI and a Seton Hall run in the 
fifth. Sophomore right-hander 
Jack Bredeson came in to pitch 
the ninth inning and gave up 

five unanswered runs, featuring 
a three-run home run from the 
Pirates. They would go on to take 
the last game of the series, 8-6.

“As a team, we did a good job 

battling,” Wenson said. “We 
played pitch-to-pitch and did 
a good job with that. They’re a 
really scrappy team and put the 
bat on the ball.”

In its season opener in Port 

St. Lucie, Fla., junior left-hander 
and ace Oliver Jaskie took the 
mound for his first start.

The Wolverines pounced first 

in the third inning after Jaskie’s 
two-inning shutout that included 
only one surrendered double. 
Sophomore first baseman Jimmy 
Kerr jumpstarted their offense 
with the team’s first hit of the 
season on a one-out single.

Brdar 
followed 
in 
Kerr’s 

footsteps with a single, and 
senior outfielder Johnny Slater 
lofted a sacrifice fly to bring 
in the pair. Thomas drove a 
single into the outfield, picking 
up another RBI and giving the 
Wolverines a 3-0 lead.

The Pirates did not back down, 

though, and in the third inning 
drove in a lone run, followed by 
three runs in the fourth to take 
a 4-3 lead.

Michigan responded in style, 

as right fielder Nick Poirer lofted 
one over the fence to force the 
game to a tie heading to the top 
of the fifth inning.

Even with a one-out double 

from Lugbauer, the Wolverines 
could not drive in another run in 
the contest, and they sacrificed 
a run in the fifth inning that 
ultimately was the dagger.

Junior 
right-hander 
Alec 

Rennard 
took 
the 
mound 

Saturday to begin Michigan’s 
doubleheader redemption day. 

And redeem themselves they 

did, as the Wolverines were able 
to tie the series, 1-1, with a walk-
off single from Lewis.

“It was great,” Lewis said. “I 

have to give credit to the guys 
getting on before me and doing 
their job.”

After a scoreless first inning, 

the game started in similar 

fashion to Friday’s debut. But 
this time, Seton Hall struck first 
with two runs in the top of the 
second.

The trio of Wenson, who 

started the surge for Michigan’s 
comeback with a liner into left 
field, sophomore right fielder 
Jonathan Engelman, who went 
3-for-4 on the contest, and 
Lewis all led the charge for the 
Wolverines.

Rennard forfeited an RBI 

double in the top of the third 
inning but Michigan was able to 
dig itself out of the hole quickly 
with two back-to-back runs 
off RBIs from Engelmann and 
Thomas, tightening the Pirates’ 
lead to one.

The Wolverines’ climb back 

to victory took hold in the fifth 
inning. Lewis earned a run off 
a Wenson RBI, and Engelmann 
followed with a two-run RBI 
double to give Michigan its first 
lead of the day, 6-5.

Under 
the 
dominant 

performance of junior right-
hander 
Jayce 
Vancena, 
the 

Wolverines were able to sit down 
Seton Hall and produce an RBI 
single from Slater in the seventh 
to give them a 7-6 lead. The 
Pirates would not shut down, 
though, and a run in the top of 
the eighth inning would send the 
game to extra innings.

In the bottom of the 10th inning, 

Lewis chopped one to shallow 
right field to drive in the winning 
run from third base and earn 
Michigan’s first win of the season.

In 
their 
second 
game, 

only going seven innings, the 
Wolverines jumped out to an 
extremely fast start with an 
RBI double from Kerr that 
highlighted a nine-run inning. 
The Pirates responded in the 
third with four runs and in the 
fourth with three runs, but 
Michigan added to its lead and 
established a 10-7 advantage.

After a delay due to darkness, 

the Wolverines never scored 
or forfeited any runs, allowing 
them to transition into the last 
game of the weekend on a 15-hit, 
10-7, win.
