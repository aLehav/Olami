MICHIGAN PROMISE SCHOLARSHIP
'U' students skeptical of
revamped Promise grant

In proposed budget,

tax credit
By TORREY ARMSTRONG
Daily StaffReporter
After the fate of the Michigan
Promise Scholarship experienced
a rollercoaster ride of ups and
downs before ultimately being
cut in the state's final budget for

the 2010 fiscal year, the fate of
the grant program has now taken
another turn.
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm unveiled a plan to restore
the Promise Scholarship in a
new form in her budget proposal
released Thursday. Under Gra-
nholm's plan, the scholarship
would reappear in the 2011 fiscal
year budget, but this time as a tax
credit given to graduates of state
universities who stay in Michigan
to work for a year or longer after
completing their education.
Students interviewed over the

last week said that while Gran-
holm's plan to reinstate the Prom-
ise Scholarship is a good initiative,
some expressed skepticism as to
whether legislators will actually
follow through with the proposal
since it's in the form of a tax cred-
it. In addition, students voiced
concern that a $4,000 tax credit
may not be enough of an incentive
to keep graduates in Michigan.

President Ford's life as a Wolverine

The relationship between
President Gerald R. Ford and
the University is a storied one.
He was a student at the Uni-
versity and during his time
here played center for two
national championship Michi-
gan football teams. In addi-
tion, the Public Policy school
also bears Ford's name. But a
better-kept secret is that Ford
served stints as a University
professor.
Ford was invited to be an
adjunct professor in 1977,
according to a Michigan Daily
article at the time. The offer
was made after Ford lost the
1976 presidential election to
Jimmy Carter.
The invitation reportedly
surprised Ford's colleagues
in Washington, who were not
aware of the appointment.
The Daily interviewed Rich-
ard Wennekamp, director of

the White House transition
team at the time, about the
offer.
"Anything like that should
have come through here first,"
Wennekamp told the Daily at
the time.
Conflicts eventually sub-
sided, however, and Ford made
his first teaching visit to the
University's Ann Arbor cam-
pus on Apr. 5, 1977. He taught
10 classes during his four-day
trip on the topics of political
science and public policy.
Ford continued to make
similar teaching visits to the
University over the next 10
years.
At his Apr. 6, 1977 lecture
at Rackham Auditorium, Ford
recommended ending the
Electoral College and keeping
presidential debates, accord-
ing to a Daily article at the
time.

The professorship was part
of a long-standing history Ford
had with the University of
Michigan.
Ford graduated from the
University in 1935 with under-
graduate degrees in econom-
ics and political science. He
also spent the summer of 1937
studying at the Michigan Law
School.
Ford spoke at the University
many times during his politi-
cal career, including a speech
at Crisler Arena that launched
his presidential re-election
campaign in December 1976.
His dedication to public ser-
vice prompted the University's
Board of Regents to unani-
mously approve renaming the
Institute of Public Adminis-
tration to the Gerald R. Ford
School of Public Policy in 1999.

Vice President
promotes one-year
anniversary of $787
billion stimulus plan
UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich.
(AP) - The year-old federal
Recovery Act that has pumped
billions in stimulus dollars into
economically devastated states
such as Michigan is working well,
Vice President Joe Biden said
yesterday, disputing Republican
claims that it has failed.
The. Democratic vice presi-
dent was in the Saginaw area,
dispatched by President Barack
Obama to defend the $787 billion
stimulus plan on its first anniver-
sary.
"It's gonna take us a while to
get us out of this ditch, but it's
working. It's working," Biden said
after touring a job training pro-
gram at Delta College that he said
benefitted from stimulus cash.
He later ate lunch at a Sagi-
naw restaurant and toured the
Thomas Township headquar-
ters of Hemlock Semiconductor

Group, which makes materials
used in solar power technology.
Both businesses also benefitted
greatly from stimulus cash, he
said.
"I absolutely refuse to accept
the notion that the United States
of America is not going to lead the
world economically throughout
the 21st Century," he said dur-
ing remarks to supporters on the
Delta campus.
"Second place is not an option
for us," he said.
As part of an effort to convince
a skeptical public that the stimu-
lus is helping, Obama this week
is sending Biden and other high-
ranking administration officials
across the country to defend the
program.
Republicans say the deficit-
spending program has failed.
"For the state with the highest
unemployment rate in the nation,
every job created in Michigan is a
step in the right direction," said
Republican National Committee
spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski.
"Unfortunately, the administra-
tion spends more time parading
officials into the state to make
promises than they spend deliver-

ing on them."
Michigan has had the nation's
highest unemployment rate for
much of the past four years. It
slightly improved in December for
the third straight month, drop-
ping slightly to 14.6 percent. But
it still towers above the national
rate of 10 percent.
The governor's office says $10.6
billion in Recovery Act funding
has been invested in the state.
Biden encouraged stimulus
skeptics to look at the case of
Justo Gonzalez, a Saginaw-area
native and resident who lost
his job in the auto industry last
March.
Gonzalez heard about a pro-
gram at Delta that offered train-
ing to become a chemical process
technician. Hehad his tuition paid
by stimulus money, graduated in
October and now is employed by
Hemlock Semiconductor.
"Life has a funny way of work-
ing things out," Gonzalez said
before introducing Biden at the
Delta event.
Biden was expected to present
a report to Obama on Wednesday
assessing the effects of the stimu-
lus plan.

in Saginaw, Mich. yesterday.

Heat wilting Rio
Carnival street
festivities
The hottest temperatures in
five decades were melting Car-

days of dancing, drinking and
smooching.
"I never thought I would say
this, but it is too hot to party,"
said 20-year-old Thiago Cerveny,
standing on a corner with his girl-
friend in Ipanema and debating
whether to hit a big street party
on the last full day of festivities.
Rio's summer has seen record
highs of up to 110 F (44 C). Couple
that with the seaside city's suffo-
cating humidity and the chances
that partiers will fall ill increases.
It was 106 F (41 C) yesterday.
Dr. Luis Fernando Correa took
to the Globo television network
to warn those still partying to
"drink a lot - but nothing alco-
holic."
Taking the booze out of what
Brazilians call the world's big-

Former Cpl. Charles Graner Jr.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for

whether the trial judge erred by
refusing to let jurors see memos
approving "enhanced interroga-

Graner, of Uniontown, Pa., was

ing them to masturbate while
other soldiers took photographs.

Daily wire reports

Second in command
Baradar captured
in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD (AP) - The cap-
ture of the Afghan Taliban's No.
2 commander by a joint CIA and
Pakistani team dealt a fresh blow
to insurgents under heavy U.S.
attack and raised hopes that Pak-
istani security forces are ready to
deny Afghan militant leaders a
safe haven.
Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar's
arrest in the Pakistani port city
of Karachi may also push other
insurgent leaders thought to be
sheltering on this side of the bor-
der toward talks with the Afghan
government - a development
increasingly seen as key to end-
ing the eight-year war.
Baradar, in his late 40s, was
the second in command behind
Taliban founder Mullah Moham-
mad Omar and was said to be in
charge of the day-to-day running
of the organization's leadership,
council, which is believed based
in Pakistan. He was a founding
member of the Taliban and is
the most important figure of the
hardline Islamist movement to be

arrested in the war.
Baradar, who also functioned
as the link between Mullah Omar
and field commanders, has been
in detention for more than 10
days and was talking to interro-
gators, two Pakistani intelligence
officials said yesterday. One said
several other suspects were also
captured in the raid. He said Bara-
dar had provided "useful informa-
tion" to them and that Pakistan
had shared it with their U.S. coun-
terparts. They spoke on condition
of anonymity because of the sensi-
tivity of the information.
The White- House declined
to confirm Baradar's capture.
Spokesman Robert Gibbs told
reporters the fight against
extremists involves sensitive
intelligence matters and he
believes it's best to collect that
information without talking
about it.
President Barack Obama's
administration has vowed to kill
or seize Taliban and al-Qaida
leaders in Afghanistan and Paki-
stan. The arrest comes as relent-
less CIA missile strikes against
militant targets in the border
tribal region have killed several
commanders.
Obama has ordered 30,000

extra troops to southern Afghan-
istan. On Saturday, thousands of
them began a major attack on the
town of Marjah in the southern
province of Helmand, one of the
regions that Baradar is believed
to control.
Former members of the Tal-
iban regime in Afghanistan and
security experts said the arrest
would hurt the Taliban but was
far from a decisive blow. They
said Baradar would likely be
quickly replaced and that local
commanders had a lot of auton-
omy from the leaders based in
Pakistan.
Nevertheless, the capture is
likely to cause short-term disrup-
tion, since Baradar was the day-
to-day commander of the Taliban
and his successor would not have
the same prestige.
"It's a great tactical success
that the coalition forces should
be pleased with, but by no means
is it the beginning of the end,"
said Will Hartley, an analyst at
Jane's Terrorism and Insurgen-
cy Center in London. "This will
have a noted effect on the short-
term ability of the Taliban to-
operate the way it was. However,
it has proved itself a resilient
organization."

VIENNA (AP) - Russia, the
U.S. andFrancehave urged Iranto

Shrugging off international
concerns, Iranian President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad announced
the country was moving ahead
to expand its enrichment capaci-
ties by installing more advanced
machinery at its main enrichment
facility.
Ahmadinejad told reporters in
Tehran yesterday the new centri-
fuges are not yet operational but
are five times more efficient than
the model now in use at its under-
ground Natanz enrichment plant.
Officials at the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy
Agency said they had no comment.
The latest IAEA report on Iran
in November said that as of early
October no advanced centrifuges
had been installed at the plant,
although some were being tested
in a separate area of the facility.
Because enrichment can pro-
duce both nuclear weapons as
well as reactor fuel, Iran is under
three sets of U.N. Security Coun-
cil sanctions for refusing to stop
its program. Its determination to
expand such activities had been
criticized worldwide even before
an announcement earlier this
month that Tehran would enrich
to a higher level.
The confidential letter critical
of the higher-enrichment plan was
shared yesterday with The Asso-
ciated Press. Dated Feb. 12, it was
addressed to IAEA chief Yukiya
Amano and signed by senior U.S.,
Russian and French envoys.
Moscow in the past has often
put the brakes on Western
attempts to penalize Tehran for
defying U.N. Security Council

demands that it freeze its enrich-
ment program, which can pro-
duce both nuclear fuel and the
fissile core of warheads. But while
Russia has recently signaled more
support for new U.N. sanctions,
China - a veto-wielding member
of the U.N. Security Council that
depends on Iran for much of its
energy needs - remains opposed.
The letter questioned the ratio-
nale of Tehran's assertion that it
had started the higher enrich-
ment project to provide fuel to a
research reactor providing medi-
cal isotopes for cancer patients.
"If Iran goes ahead with this
escalation, it would raise fresh
concerns about Iran's nuclear
intentions, in light of the fact that
Iran cannot produced the needed
nuclear fuel in time" to refuel the
research reactor, said the letter.
Iran's decision to enrich to
the 20-percent level is "wholly
unjustified, contrary to U.N.
Security Council resolutions and
represent(s) a further step toward
a capability to produce highly
enriched uranium," said the letter
to IAEA chief Amano.
The 20-percent mark rep-
resents the threshold between
low-enriched and high-enriched
uranium.
Although warhead material
must be enriched to a level of 90
percent or more, just getting its
present low-enriched stockpile to
the 20 percent mark would be a
major step for Iran's nuclear pro-
gram. While enriching to 20 per-
cent would take about one year,
using up to 2,000 centrifuges af
Tehran's underground Natanz
facility, any next step - moving
from 20 to 90 percent - would
take only half a year and between
500-1,000 centrifuges.
Since its clandestine enrich-
ment program became known
eight years ago, Iran has insisted
it is meant only to generate nucle-
ar fuel. But its secrecy and refusal
to cooperate with an IAEA probe
of allegations that it experiment-
ed with aspects of a weapons-
program had increased concerns
even before Ahmadinejad's Feb.7'
announcement that Iran wilt
raise the enrichment bar.


Ford lays off 900 workers

Mustang sales
dropped 27-percent
in 2009
DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor
Co. said yesterday that it plans to
cut 900 workers at the Michigan
plant that makes the Mustang,
which saw sales drop sharply last
year, but most will get positions.
at other facilities.
Ford will reduce shifts from
two to one in July at the AutoAl-
liance International plant in Flat
Rock, Mich. The plant, which is
jointly owned with Mazda Motor
Corp., also makes the Mazda6
midsize sedan.
The plant employs nearly 2,300
people. Most of the layoffs will be
hourly manufacturing workers,
but some salaried positions also
will be cut, Ford spokeswoman

Marcey Evans said. A majority of
workers will be offered positions
at other plants, she said.
Evans said there was signifi-
cant down time at the plant last
year. By speeding up the line and
eliminating down time, Evans
said Ford can build the same num-
ber of vehicles with one shift.
Demand for both vehicles fell
last year, but Ford is hoping it
will pick up again as the economy
improves and it introduces the
more powerful 2011 Mustang
this spring. Mustang sales fell 27
percent last year, in part because
of competition from the Chevro-
let Camaro, which went on sale
in the spring and came within
5,000 cars of outselling the Mus-
tang. The Camaro hasn't outsold
the Mustang since 1985. Mazda6
sales were down 34 percent.
Most of the Flat Rock workers
are expected to get jobs at other

plants. Ford said last month it
will hire 1,200 workers at its
Chicago Assembly Plant to build
the new Ford Explorer. Explorer
production will start at the end
of this year. Ford also recently
announced a plan to create 1,000
jobs in Michigan to make elec-
tric car batteries. Evans said the
company also needs workers at
the Michigan Assembly Plant in
Wayne, Mich., which is sched-
uled to begin producing the new
Ford Focus later this year.
Ford currently has around
600 workers on indefinite layoff
nationwide. Those workers and
the ones to be laid off at Flat Rock
will have the first opportunity
to take jobs at facilities that are
hiring. The company has been
trying to thin the ranks of hourly
'workers, most recently offering
buyout packages to all 41,000
U.S. hourly workers in December.

Alabama prof.'s
story begins wth-

Suburban homeless: rising
tide of women,, families

Bishop believed to
have shot brother
in 1986
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -
When a young woman in Massa-
chusetts killed her brother with a
shotgun blast in 1986, authorities
waited more than a week to ques-
tion family members and the death
was ultimately ruled an accident.
Now, a quarter-century later,
Amy Bishop is accused in another
shooting - an attack that killed
three fellow biology professors
at the University of Alabama in
Huntsville.
In the days 'since Friday's
shooting, revelations about Amy
Bishop's past have raised ques-
tions about whether much of the
violence could have been prevent-
ed. In the latest twist, police said
Tuesday that Bishop had also been
charged with assaulting a woman
in 2002 during a tirade over a
child's booster seat at a restaurant.
The story started more than
two decades ago when police were
called to the Braintree, Mass.,
home Bishop shared with her
parents. Authorities found her
18-year-old brother, Seth, dead of a
shotgun wound to the chest.
Bishop's father later told police
he and his daughter had a dis-
agreement and she went to her
room. She said she had wanted to
learn to load a shotgun her parents
had bought after a recent break-in.
Bishop said she accidentally
fired the gun in her bedroom as she
tried to unload it, then went down-
stairs to ask her brother to help,
accordingto a police report.
She said the gun went off again
as Seth, a Northeastern University
freshman and a virtuoso violinist,
walked across the kitchen.
She told police she thought she
had ruined the kitchen, but did not
realize she had hit her brother. She

said she ran away and thought she
dropped the gun, which went off a
third time. She did not remember
anything else until she was takeri
to a police station.
But police and witnesses say
she fled with the gun to a car deal-
ership, where she pointed it at
employees and demanded a get-
away car. She told them her hus-
band was going to come after her
and she needed to flee.
She was caught but never charged;
Police said it took 11 days before they
could interview family members'
because they were so distraught
When they finally did, authorities
decided to let her go, declaring the
wholethinganaccident.
John Polio, who headed the
Braintree police force at the time,
at first defended the handling of
the case. The 87-year-old said
Tuesday that he recently read a
1987 report on the investigation
written by a state trooper. At the
time, he had not seen the docu-
ment. But now, he says, "I would-
have wanted a lot more questions
answered."
The Norfolk County district.
attorney at the time was Williant
Delahunt, now a Democratic con-
gressman from Massachusettsp
He was traveling in the Middle
East and did not reply to repeate'
requests for comment.
The current district attorney,
WilliamKeating, said yesterday tha.
newly found police reports show"
there was probable cause to arrest
Bishop in 1986 on charges of assault'
with a dangerous weapon, carrying
a dangerous weapon and unlawful
possession of ammunition.
But, Keatingsaid, the reports do
not contradict accounts that the-
shooting was an accident.
Bishop and her husband, James
Anderson, graduated from North-
eastern in 1988 with biology
degrees. In 1993, Bishop earned.
a doctorate in genetics from Harm
yard.

Rural and suburban
homelessness at 32
percent in 2009
ROOSEVELT, N.Y. (AP) -
Homelessness in rural and subur-
ban America is straining shelters
this winter as the economy found-
ers and joblessness hovers near
double digits - a "perfect storm of
foreclosures, unemployment and a
shortage of affordable housing," in
one official's eyes.
"We are seeing many families that
never before sought government
help,"saidGregBlass, commissioner
of Social Services in Suffolk County
on eastern LongIsland.
"We see a spiral in food stamps,
heating assistance applications;
Medicaid is skyrocketing," Blass
added. "It is truly reaching a stage
of being alarming.",
The federal government is again

counting the nation's homeless
and, by many accounts, the sub-
urban numbers continue to rise,
especially for families, women,
children, Latinos and men seeking
help for the first time. Some have
to be turned away.
"Yes, there has definitely been
an increased number of turnaways
this year," said Jennifer Hill,
executive director of the Alliance
to End Homelessness in suburban
Cook County, Illinois. "We're see-
ing increases in shelter use along
the lines of 30 percent or more."
The U.S. Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development's
annual survey last year found
homelessness remained steady
at about 1.6 million people, but
the percentage of rural or subur-
ban homelessness rose from 23
percent to 32 percent. The 2009
HUD report, which reflected the
12 months ending Sept. 30, 2008,
also found the number of sheltered

homeless families grew from about
473,000 to 517,000.
Greta Guarton, executive direc-
tor of the Nassau-Suffolk Coali-
tion for the Homeless on Long
Island, led a recent group of about
40 volunteers to scour vacant lots
and industrial parks for this year's
HUD survey; results are expected
in several months.
"One of the things that we've
noticed is a lot more unsheltered,
mostly men who claim this is the
first time they've been homeless,
who indicate that it's due to a loss
of wages or loss of job, because of
the economy," Guarton said.
Stephanie Hawkins, who lost
her manager's job when a shel-
ter for drug addicts and alcohol-
ics closed last summer, is now
among about a dozen or more
"guests" living in a different kind
of Long Island shelter - this one
for women who have nowhere
else to go.

Privatize pot
Michigan must clarify laws to make marijuana sales viable
Thanks to a ballot initiative passed by Michigan voters,
medical marijuana has been legal in the state for over a
year. Unfortunately, the law's spotty legal framework fails
to clearly lay out how the drug can be grown, obtained and used,
which has led to confusion and battles about law enforcement. But
there have been recent efforts to clarify the law. Legislation now
before the state Senate could make the marijuana industry govern-
ment-owned. But the state's economy could benefit from a private
medical marijuana industry. A more appropriate way to manage
medical marijuana would be to clarify current laws so that a pri-
vate medicinal marijuana industry can thrive in Michigan.

Econom icfairytales

In November 2008, Michigan's voters
passed a ballot initiative called the Michi-
gan Medical Marihuana Act. The act legal-
ized the growth, sale and use of marijuana
for medicinal purposes in the state. The act
permits patients with diseases such as glau-
coma and cancer to request a prescription
for marijuana as a painkiller. But the act's
loose guidelines have resulted in groundless
arrests and battles to limit growing around
the state. To clarify the law, Michigan Sena-
tors Gerald Van Woerkom and Wayne Kui-
pers, both Republicans from Holland, have
proposed a bill that would make marijuana
distribution a government-run business. If
the bill passes, the state of Michigan will
allow for a limited number of facilities where
medical marijuana can be grown and regu-
late where the drug can be sold.
Michigan voters made progress by legal-
izing medical marijuana, but as is the case
with ballot initiatives, which are too short
to include specific language, the complexi-
ties of this policy weren't appropriately
outlined. Patients seeking to use marijua-
na shouldn't have to face obstacles while
acquiring a legalized medicine. The state
should create legislation that specifies'
how to legally grow and purchase medical
marijuana and clear any stumbling block to
acquiring a prescription.
The Senate legislation isn't the worst
attempt to make medical marijuana use
practical. Arguably, the existence of a

public option for marijuana could help
some patients. Many patients may feel
more comfortable purchasing marijuana
from a government-sponsored warehouse
because much of this legal drug's market is
still underground.
But a government msnopoly over medi-
cal marijuana isn't the best solution to the
problems caused by the vague ballot initia-
tive. Michigan has the opportunity to ben-
efit from new private industries in this area.
California has already embraced the priva-
tized industry of medicinal marijuana. And
although it grew more rapidly than expect-
ed, it has allowed patients to successfully
acquire the drugfrom one ofthe state's ample
dispensaries. California's poor economic sit-
uation is similar to that of Michigan and the
significant returns seen from this industry's
taxation could be a useful stimulus here.
Opponents of the law fear that putting
marijuana in the hands of more caregivers
and dispensaries would result in more mari-
juana on the market and increase recreation-
al use of marijuana. But this consequence
isn't nearly as important as facilitating medi-
cal marijuana distribution for patients who
need the drug. And, if it were legalized, rec-
reational marijuana could generate impres-
sive tax revenue beyond medical marijuana.
In a state where revenue is scarce, it is
important for Michigan to adjust its policies
to establish a private marijuana industry to
help both patients and distributors.

've reached my tipping point.
The distortions and inaccura-
cies regarding the economic
recession spewing
from the mouths
of many influential
people - including,
our very own Uni-
versity professors
- on a daily basis
is egregious and
must be addressed.
Rather than exam-
ining the cause of ALEX
the current eco-
nomic debacle, BILES
teachers dwell on
symptoms of the
crisis, presenting an inaccurate view
to students and indoctrinating them
with nonsense in the process.
The explanation most commonly
attributed to the recession espouses
the notion that free market capital-
ism, deregulation and Wall Street
greed resulted in the disaster. At best,
this account is littered with half-
truths, ignoring history that illus-
trates an alternative narrative.
By no means am I defending Wall
Street. Beginning in the 1970s, Wall
Street firms developed a series of
financial instruments in the form of
asset-backed securities like subprime
mortgages. Believing these innova-
tions to be foolproof, they had no idea
their creations would implode, con-
tributing to the housing bubble that
allowed the current crisis to occur.
But ignoring policies that promot-
ed this behavior represents a gross
misunderstanding of the true cause
of the crisis. As Harvard economist
Jeffrey Miron pointed out in 2009,
"private forces jumped willingly on
a runaway train, but it was govern-
ment that built the train and drove it
off a cliff."
The chief catalyst for the melt-
down was the federal government,
whose economic regulations and
over-promotion of risk created the
opportunity and incentives that man-
ifested themselves in the shape of the
financial crisis.
Loose lending practices involving
the expansion of the subprime mort-
gage market at the hands of free-
wheeling financial institutions are

often condemned as a failure of the
free market. Yet, the bankingsector is
arguably the most regulated industry
in the country. And the government
incentivized these firms by pursuing
policies of moral hazard.
Moral hazard is the promise of
government bailouts to lenders in
exchange for excessive risk-taking.
Clear-cut examples can be observed
in the subprime mortgage market,
where banks abandoned reasonable
lending practices and allowed indi-
viduals with poor credit histories to
take out loans they were notequipped
to handle.
These irrational loaning prac-
tices occurred partially a result of
the government's move to charter
the nation's largest mortgage lend-
ers - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
in 1938 and 1970, respectively. The
willingness of creditors to issue sub-
prime loans was further exacerbated
by the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, which pressured the indus-
try to loan to risky borrowers. This
phenomenon exemplified yet another
failed remnant of the Great Society
programs that Lyndon Johnson pro-
posed during the 1960s.
With the implicit guarantee of a
bailout by the federal government,
Fannie and Freddie gladly obliged,
taking on tremendous risk in the pro-
cess. The issuance of subprime loans
burgeoned and the housing bubble
was created. These lending practices
continued well into the mid-2000s
with a financial industry hell-bent on
maintaining the housing boom.
Faulty estimates of default risk by
rating agencies also contributed to
the crisis, as these entities respon-
sible for providing judgment con-
cerning the safety of securities badly
misjudged risks. The rating agencies
- Standard & Poor's, Moody's Cor-
poration and Fitch Ratings - which
the government contracted, were
motivated to provide positive ratings,
as it was most conducive to stimulat-
ing housing construction as well as
establishing favorable connections
with federal regulators.
Perhaps the most dominant force
behind the economic downturn is the
Federal Reserve and its monopolistic
powers over the nation's monetary

policy. A highly politicized quasi-
independent entity, the Fed shoulders
much of the blame for creating the
housing bubble by setting artificially
low interest rates. This was evident
in 2001 when former chairman of the
Fed Alan Greenspan lowered a key
interest rate to a historic low of less
than 1 percent. By settinglow interest
rates, the Fed pumps billions of dol-
lars into the economy, encouraging
creditors to engage in risky behavior
like subprime lending.
Wall Street isn't
solely at fault
for the recession.
The expansion of currency coor-
dinated by the Fed, known as infla-
tion, drives up costs by reducing the
purchasing power of the dollar. The
rise in housing prices, sustained until
2007, was not merely a product of
supply and demand. It was a result
of a Fed monetary policy that arti-
ficially created demand by making
it simple to obtain cheap credit and
consequently spend recklessly.
There's no doubt that self-inter-
ested Wall Street firms played an
integral role in fostering subprime
lending and the aggressive-market-
ing of housing-backed securities. But
a simple look into the roots of the
crisis reveals that subprime lending
and other actions of creditors were a
symptom of the housing bubble - not
its cause.
Some may find it difficult to stop
using a free market that never existed
as a scapegoat for the recession, but
the fact is the government played
a fundamental role in the crisis
through economic intervention that
provided incentives for reckless loan-
ing practices in the first place - not
the anti-capitalist rhetoric students
are currently being spoon-fed inside
University lecture halls..

ELSON LIV I
Increasing grad student involvement

TO THE DAILY:
The headline of Madeline O'Campo's recent
viewpoint doesn't properly designate who is
being honored at this spring's commencement
ceremony (It's my graduation, not Obama's,
2/16/2010). The headline should read, "It's
our graduation, not Obama's." Not that the
headline doesn't appropriately summarize
O'Campo's view - she seems to think her feel-
ings trump those of her graduating classmates.
In truth, we, the graduating seniors, are over-
whelmingly in favor of Obama being the com-
mencement speaker. Does it matter what half
of the country thinks when the vast majority of
us are in favor?
O'Campo's viewpoint is filled with logical
fallacies not befitting a Michigan graduate.
Referring to Obama as a "polarizing figure"
implies an act of polarization on Obama's
part. The truth of the matter is that Obama is
a political figure in a highly polarized society,
nothing more, nothing less. In today's politi-
cal climate, any politician or policy is seen as
polarizing. Consider the debate over health
insurance. Despite the fact that the majority
of Americans are in favor of reform, a fervent
minority is blocking such measures. The same
can be said of any number of political debates.
There is no consensus on any single political
issue today.
Moreover, O'Campo supposes that Obama's
commencement speech will be, in fact, a stan-
dard political speech. I find absolutely no
reason for her supposition in O'Campo's view-
point, so I find absolutely no reason to share
this fears. From what I can gather (factual
information rather than speculation), Obama
will make a commencement speech. Many
others have done so without venturing into
the political. O'Campo suggests Obama will
talk about, "jobs, manufacturing or Michi-
gan's economy." Why would one assume such
things? Obama is a politician, but he is also, by
all accounts, a brilliant man. Are we to believe
he is so stupid as to confuse a commencement
speech with a stump speech?
Finally, O'Campo says, "(Obama's) presence
will turn the graduation ceremony into a politi-
cal event." O'Campo has beaten Obama to the
punch. Obama has accepted an invitation to be
the commencement speaker. at our graduation,
not make a State of the Union address. Why
would O'Campo assume otherwise? Perhaps
she is allowing her distaste for Obama to cloud
her thinking. I don't believe Obama is at fault
here, but O'Campo certainly is.

LSA Senior

TO THE DAILY:
I feel I should point out two very important
things that Joe Sugiyama may have overlooked
in his recent viewpoint (Mastering Engineer-
ing, 02/15/2010).
First, he suggests that "Maybe we could fol-
low the example of our friends across the pond
and institute a five-year program resulting in a
master's degree." Such a program already exists
at the University. It's called the Simultaneous
Graduate/Undergraduate Study program. All
engineering majors offer it. Though Sugiyama
recommends it for all engineering students, the
program requires a minimum cumulative 3.2
GPA, or even higher in certain departments,
which not all engineering students have.
I got my BSE and MSE through the program,
and based on my experience I recommend it.
Still, graduate school isn't for everyone, and stu-
dents who plan on stopping at a master's degree
will likely have difficulty receiving funding for
the extra year the five-year program requires.
Loans for four years of tuition are bad enough.
Second, not alltypesofengineers can or should
obtain Professional Engineeringlicenses.When I
looked up Sugiyama's directory entry I was not
surprised to discover thathe is a civil engineer. It
is much more difficult to obtain employment as a
civil engineer without the PE qualification. The
requirement is therefore advertised in civil engi-
neering classes at the sophomore level.
However, in nuclear engineering, the PE
qualification is not particularly common, and
since the exam tests heavily on nuclear power
reactor knowledge, any other type of nuclear
engineer - those specializing in radiation mea-
surements, medical imaging, radiation beam
therapy or radiation protection, for example -
would waste their time by taking the exam. This
holds true for some engineers in other special-
ties as well. Additionally, if an engineer plans
on working for a firm or corporation, only one
person in the organization needs to have a PE
qualification in order for the entire organization
to be able to offer engineering services for gov-
ernment contracts or the public.
Many engineers learn just as well or better,
through experience as opposed to more time in
academia, and many engineers cannot or should
not seek the Professional Engineer Certification.
I want to ensure that engineers just starting their
careers are not misled by Sugiyama's viewpoint.
Though it was well-written and well-intentioned,
it does not apply to all engineers and should not
scare off anyone who does notwish to go to grad-
uate school or take the PE exam.
John Harvey
Rackham EngineeringPh.D. candidate

Recently, The Michigan Daily has reported the on
efforts of Students for Progressive Governance (S4PG)
to amend the Michigan Student Assembly All-Campus
Constitution, which establishes a central student govern-
ment for all students at the University. (Students move
forward on changes to MSA constitution, 2/2/2010.) While
the reforms being proposed by S4PG will benefit all stu-
dents, they will produce particularly strong incentives for
graduate students.
One of the most powerful changes proposed by S4PG is
a new legislative body called the University Council. The
body would consist of a representative from each school
or college government. Graduate representatives could
fill more than half the seats of this body, which will facili-
tate communication and collaboration among the school
and college governments and propose legislation that
must be considered by the central student legislature.
The University Council will fix a longstanding prob-
lem with graduate representation. Currently, MSA
representatives are supposed to maintain contact with
their constituents. But after three years as a Rackham
representative for MSA, I can count on one hand the
number of Rackham reps who have regularly attended
Rackham Student Government meetings (fewer than
half of the Rackham representatives on MSA who served
in that time).
Not only are graduate student representatives discon-
nected from their constituents, but their constituents
are divorced from each other. Medical students rarely
interact with Law students and Rackham students rarely
interact with MBA candidates.
Through the University- Council and increased par-
ticipation in the assembly and commissions, graduate
students would meaningfully collaborate in student gov-
ernment for the first time. We will have access to Univer-
sity-wide resources and be able to bring the best practices
back to the students we serve.
Some graduate students may believe that S4PG's pro-
posals are insufficient. In particular, some have expressed
a desire for two "separate but equal" governments - one
for undergraduates and one for graduate and profession-

al students. They claim more graduate and professional
students would participate in a student government com-
posed of graduate and professional students.
My personal experience indicates otherwise. In a past
election, I was elected separately to MSA and to the Rack-
ham Student Government by fewer than 10 votes. In that
election, more voters elected me to MSA. The new consti-
tution encourages graduate students to create a common
government and participate in University-wide govern-
ment. Graduate students will have their donuts and cider,
and eat them, too.
Some "separate but equal" advocates may claim that
their ideas were not properly considered by S4PG. I dis-
agree. Graduate and professional students participated
in all S4PG general body meetings and committee meet-
ings. A graduate student served as an S4PG executive
officer and others chaired and I, a Rackham student, vice-
chaired the S4PG Governance Committee, which formu-
lated the proposed reforms. The idea of a separate central
undergraduate student government and central graduate
and professional student government was deliberated at
length at several S4PG Governance Committee meetings.
When the issue was finally put to a vote at the Dec. 16
S4PG Governance Committee meeting, as many gradu-
ate students voted for one central student government as
voted for "separate but equal."
Over the past week, members of S4PG have been cir-
culating a petition to place a question on the ballot of the
upcoming MSA election to adopt S4PG's proposed con-
stitution. They collected well over the 1,000 signatures
required, so pending the certification of the petition by
the Central Student Judiciary, it is likely that S4PG's
proposed constitution will be put to a vote of the entire.
student body in the upcoming MSA elections in March.
I encourage all students to read about S4PG's proposals
(available on the S4PG website: http://s4pg.info) and to
vote for the adoption of S4PG's proposed constitution so

All's Well' for 'U'
studio production

Doin it weredoggy style.
Wolfdeclawed

Neither the full moon
nor this film help out
Benicio del Toro
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
Universal Pictures has again
lived up to its penchant for remak-
ing superhero and
monster films with
"The Wolfman,"
a remake of the
1940s Lon Chaney The Wolfman
Jr. movies of the At Quality16
same name. The and Showcase
film draws some Universal
of its best plot ele-
ments from its pre-
decessors, but it should have relied
more upon the raw acting potential
of its accomplished cast instead of its
distinction as a "bankable franchise."
Most werewolf enthusiasts who
catch the Joe Johnston ("Jurassic
Park 3") update will find a veritable
paradise of homages to previous
works: The romantic side story of
"An American Werewolf in London"
is there, as are the Gypsy themes, the
silver-headed walking stick, the Tal-

hot character and the werewolf visage
of Chaney Jr.'s 1941 original. But the
one vital quality missing is structure,
and the movie flounders miserably
through most of its plot as a result.
For starters, we're introduced to
the familiar concepts of werewolf-
ism and lycanthropy with laughable
juvenility. Cause and effect elements
of a plot thread should never draw
so much attention to themselves as
this, but the story is forced upon us
so frenetically that it appears like no
more than a series of rapid sequences.
Since the filmmakers know this to be
an incomplete, introductory format,
they supplement it with pedantic dia-
logue that would be appropriate were
we watching a documentary about the
history of werewolf lore.
Nothing is quite as irritating as
Danny Elfman's score; it's as obnoxious
as one by Howard Shore, should he ever
consume near-lethal doses of cocaine.
The music fills the air with an epic dis-
quiet, even during scenes where pure
silence would have most effectively
heightened the tension. As a result, the
audience begins to discuss the short-
comings of the film as it progresses -
why must it proclaim its glory to us so
earnestly? The true glory of a movie is
in its subtleties, those qualities added

so seamlessly into the final composite
that we scarcely notice them. As anyone
whose ears have suffered permanent
damage by "The Wolfman" will surely
tell you, subtlety is foreign to this hairy,
abominable movie.
Surely, the $150 million budget
wasn't all for naught. The scene in
which Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del
Toro, "Che") is forcibly displayed to
the London aristocracy is absolutely
harrowing, and we're made to feel
as haplessly trapped as the nobles
when Lawrence undergoes his pain-
ful transformation from man to
monster. The gore is generous and
stylized, and it's clever and effective
in its naked form; in light of that, it's
a shame the final cut was so exces-
sively vested in cheap scares and pre-
tentious music.
Word to the (occasionally) wise
men of Universal: When you've been
endowed with such talent as del Toro,
Hugo Weaving ("The Matrix") and
Sir Anthony Hopkins ("Silence of the
Lambs"), you should let their knack
for proficient performance speak for
itself. When the cumbersome presen-
tation of "The Wolfman" causes us to
question the storytelling rather than
the story, it begins to resemble a par-
ody more than a substantial remake.

By HEATHER POOLE
Daily Arts Writer
While students may cringe at the thought of
the dreaded iambic pentameter, the upcoming
University studio production of Shakespeare's
"All's Well That Ends Well"
addresses the exciting and Ail's Well
contemporary issues of gen- That Ends
der roles and sexuality.
This Thursday through Well
Sunday, the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance's perfor- Thursday at
mance will feature the talents 7:30 p.m.,
of Musical Theater students Friday and
under the guidance of direc- Saturday at8$
tor and assistant professor in p.m., Sunday
the Department of Theatre & at2 p.m.
Dance Malcolm Tulip. Walgreen
"All's Well That Ends Well" Drama Center
explores complicated issues Ticketslfrom $9
concerning marriage and love.
"If you had to say what the play is about, it
might be about ... love and marriage - are they
compatible?" Tulip said. "And then as soon as
you ask that question then all the rest starts to
tumble around it: the idea of marriage as a con-
tract, not as a realization or the consummation
of love, but as something that has to do with
other business transactions."
"Social and gender roles are definitely a pre-
dominant theme in the show and ... how the
class dominates the sexuality, how men treat
the women and how they basically objectify
women," said Tyler Jones, a Musical Theater
junior who will play Bertram, a leading role.
"All's Well That Ends Well" is one of the few
studio productions conducted by the Depart-
ment of Musical Theater each year. Unlike a full
production like last October's "Evita," a studio
production often operates on a lower budget but
allows more room for experimentation.
Studio productions are one of the opportu-
nities offered to Musical Theater students who
choose to participate outside of class.
"The focus in astudio rather than a full produc-
tion is really on the process," Tulip said. "It's on
the acting and on the development of character."
The absence of Shakespeare in recent studio
productions led Tulip to choose "All's Well That
Ends Well." Both Tulip and the students were
attracted to the freedom of undertaking this
complex and rarely performed play.
"I think it's interesting because it's not very

clear whether it's a comedy or tragedy," said
Laura Reed, a Musical Theater sophomore, who
will be playing Helena, one of the leading roles.
"We had a lot of choices to make about the
characters. A lot of it was up to us to discover for
ourselves and what we wanted the production
to be, which ... was alot of fun," she added.
"It's not a 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'As You Like
It.' It is something that was unfamiliar to us,"
said Cody Davis, a Musical Theater junior, who
will be playing the King. "And you ... get to cre-
ate more of your own art rather than thinking of
the past and what you have seen."
In addition to the many possibilities in char-
acters, "All's Well That Ends Well" explores com-
plicated issues concerning marriage and love.
Though Tulip intends to keep the produc-
tion as close to the original play as possible -
only cutting one line and changing 12 words
- the cast and crew changed the time period
from the 1600s to a more modern setting in the
1950s.
"I had a desire to see it in something more
modern so the audience isn't focusing on the
historical side of it," Tulip said. "And atthe same
time, I didn't want to ... get so hung up on the
'50s that we forget what the play is about. So
the truthful answer is that the '50s is there for a
modern sensibility, slightly more old-fashioned
than now."
Shakespeare's play
on love and marriage
stands the test of time.
Reed, Jones and Davis all expressed apprecia-
tion in working with Tulip, a regular director in
the department's studio productions since 2001.
"In all honesty, I love working with (Tulip)
because he's able to get such a natural way out
of anyone, in a way that makes it seem like they
aren't doing a contrived performance," Jones
said. "He's just really gifted at getting people to
act at their full potential."
Under the direction of Tulip, along with the
dedication of the cast, this adaption of "All's
Well That Ends Well" speaks to the enduring
complexities of human nature and love without
clouding the plot with a dated setting.

MSA

is leaning towards the Aetna plan
because the other companies making
pitches were unfamiliar with how to
deal with a University as large as the
University of Michigan.
"There are other options on the
plate, but when they contacted all
of the other vendors they were very
compatible with Michigan," he said.
"I think the one that's left is the one
that we're seeing. Unless something
drastic happens, that will probably
be the final one to stand."
If the option is endorsed, Klever
said Aetna Student Health would
provide insurance to any students
who are working toward a degree at
the University.
"A lot of these insurance compa-
nies do exclude students who are
working part time and require them
tobe fulltime," Kleversaid.
Winfield spoke at last night's
meeting and said it is important for
Aetna to believe it is competing with
other companies because competi-
tion yields more health care options
for MSA to choose from.
MSA has yet to draft a resolution
endorsing Aetna Student Health, but
according to Mahanti, the endorse-
ment will be made in the upcoming
week.

their primary job responsibilities.
The Human Resources study
showed a 6.7-percent increase in the
number of tenured and tenure-track
faculty from 1999 to.2009. Similar-
ly, the data showed a 28.4-percent
increase in lecturers over the same
time period. At the same time that
the number of lecturers is increas-
ing faster than that of tenured and
tenure-track faculty, the number of
students enrolled at the University
is increasing. The University had
38,103 undergraduate and gradu-
ate students enrolled in fall 2000.
By fall 2009, that number increased
by about 9 percent to 41,674 under-
graduate and graduate students.
SEXUAL ASSAULT
From Page 1A
statistics in mind, many members of
the Greek community are involved
in raising sexual assault awareness
and prevention and have the power
to do so given the number of mem-
bers living in each Greek chapter.
"Every community still has
learning that they can do regarding
sexual assault issues since every-
body on campus is at high risk of
either being assaulted or knowing
someone who has been," Nimeh
said. "The Greek community is
unique in the sense of their connec-
tions and ability to reach out to a
large numberofstudents."
She added that SAPAC works
closely with the Interfraternity
Council - the governing body for a
large portion of the fraternities
on campus - to put on a men's activ-
ism program that is offered to all
new IFC members. The workshop
discusses sexual assault, partner
violence and how men can be proac-
tive in preventing these issues.
Engineering junior George
Schick, IFC vice president of pro-
gramming, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the main focus of the

workshop is to acclimate new mem-
bers to the responsibilities involved
in being part of the Greek commu-
nity - including promoting safety at
parties.
"An important aspect of this pro-
gram is our emphasis on a respon-
sible attitude toward the use of
GLOBAL HEALTH

people are thinking about larger,
global problems."
"I believe that universities should
be the places where the world's big-
gest problems are addressed," he
said.
With this in mind, Yamada told
students in attendance that he
"challenges" them and the Universi-
ty to support the foundation's Global
Health Program.
In addition to discussing pos-
sible student involvement in the
program, Yamada also discussed
the program's efforts to invest in
technology to discover and develop
innovative solutions to problems in
health care. With a primary focus
on South Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa, Yamada said the program
tries to find answers to global health
pandemics like HIV, malaria and
tuberculosis, and other health issues
like maternal and child health care.
These geographic regions were
chosen as focal points for the pro-
gram because they have some of the
most pressing health concerns in
the world but are largely neglected,
according to Yamada.

MSAALLOCATESFUNDING
FOR SPRING CONCERT
The Michigan Student Assembly
allocated$25,000tohost asubsidized
concert for University students this
March. The assembly passed the reso-
lution 28-1at last night's meeting.
While representatives haven't
chosen the artist for the concert, they
say they want to get "big name art-
ists" to perform at Hill Auditorium.
MSA will collaborate with Big
Ticket Productions and New Beat
Happening - two groups based in
the Michigan Union that bring per-
formers to campus - to host the
concert. The assembly is also look-
ing into working with the student
government at the University's Flint
campus as part of the project.
Though MSA couldn't sell enough
tickets to fill the venue at its last
sponsored concert - featuring rap-
per Ludacris at Hill Auditorium -
Mahanti said in an interview last
month he has a plan to make sure
they sell enough tickets this time
around. Mahanti speculated that the
$30 ticket price deterred students
from attending the concert five years
ago. He saidlhe is trying to keepticket
prices low this year by spending less
money on the artist, who they have
yet to determine.
"It was bad judgment on MSA's
part back then," Mahanti said last
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily last week, Sullivan said
University officials are committed
to maintaining an appropriate stu-
dent-faculty ratio.
"What we really keep a close
eye on is the faculty-student ratio
to make sure that as the number of
students increases, the instruction-
al staff is adequate as well," Sullivan
said. "But these data do not indi-
cate to me that we're substituting
one group for the other. If anything
we're hiring more of everything."
Sullivan said even though there
are more lecturers teaching classes,
the quality of a student's education
is not suffering. She said lectur-
ers tend to teach many introduc-
tory LSA courses, adding that most
underclassmen take a class with
a lecturer at one point or another.
alcohol and toward the well-being
of students at this university,"
Schick wrote. "In addition, many of
our chapters choose to implement
educational programming on the
chapter level. These programs dem-
onstrate a commitment by Greek
organizations to constantly improve
the knowledge and character of
their members."
He cited some chapter programs
that host officers from the Ann
Arbor Police Department and stu-
dent presenters from organizations
like SAPAC.
Mary Beth Seiler, director of
Greek Life, said the Panhellenic
Association - the governing body
for most sororities on campus -
hasn't had any community-wide
programs in more than a year since
most of the programs are held at a
chapter level.
"It's a topic that's obviously very
sensitive," Seiler said. "And there
are some topics that might be more
effective ina smaller setting."
However, Seiler said Panhel is
planning a self-defense program
called You Can Defend Yourself that
will happen in the next few weeks.
The program will consist of a few
hours of community-wide defense

training in addition to workshops
with individual chapters. Self-
defense program instructor Katy
Mattingly, University alum and
author of the book "Self-Defense:
Steps to Survival," will direct the
workshop. Mattingly plans to teach
the attendants how to physically
defend themselves from an attack
is made," he said in an interview
with reporters prior to his lecture.
One of the program's major
investments is. in vaccines, which
Yamadasaid costvery littlebuthave
the potential to save many lives.
During his speech, Yamada said
the program will continue this
investment, as it recently made a $10
billion commitment to provide vac-
cines to places in need over the next
10 years. Yamada also talked about
other areas of health care that need
to be addressed, like infant mortal-
ity, for which vaccines do not nec-
essarily provide a solution. Instead,
other cost-effective methods like
using sterile knives to cut umbili-
cal cords or preventing the usage of
dirty water to wash babies can be
implemented.
Though the program's initiatives
have been successful thus far, Yama-
da said that India - where several
of the foundation's programs have
been launched - is an example of
a country that has lingering health
care problems. Thirty percent of
child deaths throughout the world
are in India, according to Yamada.
Yamada said while this statistic
is significant, he is more appalled by
the fact that 48 percent of children
in India are undernourished.
"The problem of child health is
one that lasts way beyond limited

month. "Now what we are doing
differently is that we are aiming for
smaller artists - artists that won't
cost as muchmoney."
Mahanti said last month that the
hosts of the event, including MSA,
would subsidize the price of tickets.
He said the assembly wants every
student at the University to be able to
afford a ticket.
"Basically, MSA will be making
the concert as cheap as possible for
students," Mahanti said. "We don't
plan on making a profit."
MSA Treasurer Vishal Bajaj said
last night that potential performers
for the spring concert are concerned
that a low-ticket price could send a
negative message to fans, by imply-
ing that their performance is not
worth a normal ticket price.
Students suggested MSA sponsor
a concertduringlast semester's What
To Fix Day, where MSA invited stu-
dents to make recommendations to
the assembly. Students voiced their
frustrations with high-ticket prices
at local music venues.
"The University, for awhile, hasn't
had a priority of bringing artists to
campus," Mahanti said last month.
"We thought that this year would be
a good year to try itso we could meet
the student demand for it."
LSA representative Sahib Singh,
chair of the Budget Priorities Com-
mittee, said last night that the con-
However, she said upperclassmen
tend to be in smaller, more discus-
sion-based classes with tenured or
tenure-track professors.
Sullivansaid mostofthe timelec-
turers are more equipped to teach
the lower-level classes because they
are experts in relatively obscure
fields of study or in the case of lec-
turers for foreign language courses,
they are often native speakers.
"Often lecturers are actually
pedagogically specialized in that
content," Sullivan said.
Additionally, Sullivan noted that
though there have been increases in
the number of lecturers and profes-
sors, the largest spike has been in
the number of clinical faculty.
"Thebigincrease is the clinical fac-
ulty.That'sgone from506(in2000)to
1,265(in2009)," Sullivansaid. "That's
through simple techniques, recog-
nition of warning signs and trust in
one's instincts.
Mattingly, who has been teach-
ing personal safety since 1995, said
the three main risk factors for being
a victim of sexual violence are being
female, aged 16 to 24 years old and
being a person who dates or hooks
up with men.
"A lot of people who meet those
three characteristics attend U of
M, and a lot of them are women
who live in the Greek community,"
she said. "However, sexual violence
is a problem in all campuses and
in all communities. It's not just a
problem at fraternity parties, and
unfortunately sometimes the Greek
community gets an undeserving
reputation."
Mattingly said sororities are the
most common group to approach
her for a class - notingthat because
they're all female environments and
in the Greek community, they are
at a higher risk for being a target of
sexual assault.
"One ideais that women that live
in all-women housing like sorori-
ties have an experience that a lot of
women don't have unless they go to
an all-women's college," she said.

"Another possibility is because
they know they are more targeted
since they are in the Greek commu-
nity so there's a higher awareness
among them."
Engineering sophomore Erin
Rocci, vice president of risk man-
agement for Delta Delta Delta, said
every new member is required to go
years of childhood itself," he said.
Yamada said one of the prob-
lems the program has encountered
in India and other countries is the
problem of delivering the health
solutions, which is something that
he said requires further innovation.
But Yamada said the program
isn't only about dealing with health
care issues in developing nations,
adding that some of the solutions.
can be applied to the United States.
"The solutions are going to
come from lessons we've learned
from experiences in the developing
world," he said.
John Kettley, the clinical man-
ager of the University's Psychiatry
Emergency Services who was in
attendance at the lecture, said he
felt the program's solutions to pre-
natal care could "readily apply in
the United States."
Dele Davies, chair of Michigan
State University's Department of
Pediatrics and Human Develop-
ment, who was also in attendance
said he feels impediments to health
care in the United States stem from
the nation's view that it is above
other countries and therefore refus-
es to learn from them.
"I think there's some ideas
we maybe don't adopt as quickly
because we think we know better,"
he said.

cert is crucial to getting students
involved in student government.
"This is something we have to
do," Singh said. "We have to get a
large program and get everything
involved, and this is the best way to
do that."
MSA VOTES TO PUT
CONSTITUTION ONBALLOT
The Michigan Student Assembly
passed a resolution in a 28-1 vote,
with six abstentions, to adopt a new
studentconstitution that was revised
by Students 4 Progressive Gover-
nance - a student organization
formed to rewrite the studentconsti-
tution. S4PG accumulated 1,480 stu-
dent signatures in support ofthe new
constitution. The student body will
vote on whether or not to adopt the
proposed constitution during MA's
spring elections.
MSA Rackham representative
Kate Stenvig said the new constitu-
tion's language fails to include all
the constituents MSA is supposed
to represent. In addition she said the
student body doesn't have enough
information to make an educated
decision on the document.
"In order for MSA to responsi-
bly recommend this to the student
body it's important for the student
body to understand (this docu-
ment)," she said.
a 250-percent increase. So that's
where our real growth is occurring."
The majority of clinical fac-
ulty members teach in the Medi-
cal School but a handful teach in
the Law School and in the School
of Nursing. Sullivan said there has
been an increase in the clinical staff
because there has been an increase
in the amount of patients at Uni-
versity hospitals. "For the clinical
faculty, an important issue is how
much clinical volume there is over
at the hospital," she said. "Right
now, the hospital is doing a lot of
business and the hospital has been
full almost all year - to the point
when the H1N1 was strong, there
weren't any rooms over there. As
long as we have a lot of clinical busi-
ness there will be a need for a lot of
clinical faculty."
to a SAPAC meeting as part of the
pledge process for all Panhel mem-
bers, which allows them to learn
about SAPAC and what it offers
students. Rocci also organizes a few
workshops, which specifically deal
with sexual assault prevention and
overall awareness, for her house
throughout the year.
She said this semester Tri Delt
will have a speaker come to talk to
the members about healthy rela-
tionships. In addition, she is also
helping to plan a wellness week,
which will be dedicated to promot-
ing healthy lifestyles, personal safe-
ty and healthy eating.

PROMISE
From Page 1A
ing to University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald - awarded students
$500 to $4,000 over the course of
four years based on a merit exam
taken during high school. The
scholarship was given to approxi-
mately 96,000 college students in
the state.
officials are hopeful the new
Promise Scholarship, if included
in the budget by the House and
Senate, will play a key role in
improving Michigan's economy
by serving as an incentive for
college graduates to stay in the
state.
"I think there are a number of
features of the plan that focus on
helping the state's economy, includ-
ing the goal of helping to reverse
the brain drain that a lot of people
are worried about," Cynthia Wil-
banks, vice president for govern-
ment relations, wrote in an e-mail
interview with The Michigan Daily
last week.
Business junior Jason Raymond,
chair of the Michigan Student
Assembly's External Relations
Committee, said he's wary of the
state legislature's ability to ham-
mer out the proposal's details.
"I'm definitely glad she brought
it up, but if you listen to her speech,
she doesn't outline how to budget
money for it," Raymond said. "So
it's a start, but it remains to be seen
whether (the state's) congress will
even pass it."
Rackham student Jordan
Twardy, president of the Student
Association of Michigan - an orga-
nization comprised of student lead-
ers from 11 universities in the state
- was similarly cautious of poten-
tial costs to students.
Though Granholm proposed to
keep state funding for higher edu-
cation at the current year's budget
level, Twardy said he's concerned
this allocation won't be sustained
during the budget negotiations.
"Every time we insist on not
raising taxes, we end up having to
cut funding to higher education,
which is just a backdoor tax on
students," he said. "To me, that's
the state government saying they
don't have the spine to follow
through on making higher educa-
tion a priority."
Twardytold the Daily in January
that SAM, MSA and Stop The Hike
- a campus group aimed at curbing
the cost of tuition - are tentatively
planning a protest of potentially
drastic cuts in state appropriations
to higher education in Lansing on
Mar. 24.
"It'd be nice, but I just don't
know if it has any teeth," Twardy
said of Granholm's directive to
freeze higher education appropria-
tions."We've had this rhetoric of
'no new taxes, cut, cut cut,' and now
we can't raise any revenue for it."

Raymond said he and his col-
leagues plan to devote their energy
to lobbying for an end to cuts in
state funding for higher education,
as Granholm has proposed.
"It's kind of a wait and see thing
right now," Raymond said. "They
just need to know that if the state's
going to emerge from the recession
it's currently in, higher education is
going to be a large part of the solu-
tion."
Several students said they were
happy to see a plan put in motion to
restore the scholarship.
"At least she's trying to appease
us," LSA freshman Grace Lieb
said. "It obviously wasn't much of a
promise when they took it away, so
any effort to bring it back is a good
thing."
LSA freshman Adrienne Meltzer
said she is unsure whether the new
version of the scholarship will be a
strong enough incentive to attract
enough prospective in-state stu-
dents that would collectively work
to improve the state's economy.
"I think there's still some incen-
tive," Meltzer said. "However, if
your financial aid is still such that
you can't pay for tuition up front,
which is required, knowing you'll
get the tax credit in four years
isn't going to change your position
much."
Meltzer added that having the
scholarship in the form of a tax
credit after graduation won't help
many students and their families
struggling to pay tuition during
their undergraduate years.
"If you need the money deducted
from your tuition right away, that
could be a problem for some fami-
lies," she said.
Engineering freshman Moham-
med Rafid said the $4,000 tax
credit is also probably too small
an amount to deter students from
more affluent families from leaving
the state after graduation.
"Even with the down economy,
there are families in )Michigan
that have money," he said. "Com-
ing from a middle-income family,
$4,000 wouldn't have held me back
from going out of state if I'd wanted
to."
Rafid also said he didn't think
the new version of the scholarship
would pass the House and Senate.
"It's too much money for a pro-
gram that might not be effective,"
he said.
Twardy said he thinks a stable
economy will ultimately influence
students' decisions whether to stay
in Michigan after graduation.
"Graduates will eat through that
$4,000 if they can't find jobs," he
said. "I think it's great that they're
incentivizing the students to stay
in state, but we have to make sure
the infrastructure is there and the
jobs are there before people will do
that."
Legislators are expected to
return a revised budget to Gran-
holm by July 1.

Blue finds its stroke from
downtown in clutch win

By GJON JUNCAJ
Daily Sports Editor
IOWA CITY - Ina helter-skelter
season for the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team, there is still some-
thing to_
be said MICHIGAN 80
for the IOWA 78
impor-
tance of momentum. The Wolver-
ines brought the confidence earned
from last Thursday's win at Minne-
sota with them into Carver-Hawk-
eye Arena last night.
The hot three-point shoot-
ing carried them early. And with
Michigan staring at a potentially
gut-wrenching road loss, DeShawn
Sims carried the team on his back.
The senior forward nailed a
game-tying triple with six seconds
left in regulation, giving the Wol-
verines a second chance. Sims and
the Wolverines made good on the
opportunity, stealing a thrilling
80-78 victory from Iowa.
Sims shot 8-of-18 from the floor
and pulled down eight rebounds in
the game's final 25 minutes, includ-
ing his biggest shot of the season
- when few in the arena were
expectingit.
"My thought there was that (the
Hawkeyes) were really going to sit
on our three-point guys," Michigan
coach John Beilein said of the play-
call atnthe end of regulation. "There's
one guy that they're not going to sit
at. ... It was a quicker-hitting play as
well. I thought they'd be sitting on a
lot of our other stuff.
"It was just a hunch, and it
worked. If it doesn't, you're all say-
ing, 'Why the heck did you go to
DeShawn Sims?"'
Sims was quiet in the first half,
knocking down just two jumpers
while being defended by Hawkeye
center Jarryd Cole. But with the
game going back and forth through-
out the second half, the Detroit
native became exceptionally aggres-
sive in the post, going directly at
Cole and Hawkeye forward Eric
May. Sims shot a season-high 25
attempts, seven more than his next-
highest mark.

Two 3-pointers late
against Hawkeyes
lift the Wolverines
in overtime contest
By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Editor
IOWA CITY - After strug-
gling through much of the season
with its three-point shooting, the
Michigan men's basketball team
finally had a big night.
Senior forward DeShawn Sims
hit the game-tying shot that
forced overtime and sophomore
forward Stu Douglass's triple ulti-
mately gave the Wolverines the
lead for good.
Perhaps most crucial was the
effort by junior guard Manny
Harris, who not only made Michi-
gan's first shot in overtime, but
also made two key threes late in
the second half when the Wol-
verines (6-7 in the Big Ten, 13-12
overall) were battling to keep it
close.
Midway through the second
half with Michigan down two,
Harris drove to the basket, missed
his shot but got the rebound and
drained it to give Michigan a
48-46 lead.
"He hit a huge three when we
needed him to, off a broken play,"
Michigan coach John Beilein said.
"So he's still got a lot of courage,
we just try to channel that in the
right direction. Against some
teams he runs into a wall when
he's courageous, but today he real-
ly showed some great courage."

ing (in the first half) as far as scoring
angles," Sims said. "It just became
better by the lastminute, minute and
a half. I just wanted to take over the
game."
For Michigan (6-7 Big Ten, 13-12
overall), it was the second consecu-
tive game at Iowa that was decided
in overtime. And though last year's
loss nearly derailed the Wolverines'
season, the team saw last night as a
chance for salvaging a 2009-10 cam-
paign that seemed like it was spiral-
ing out of control just a week ago.
"Last year, we were fighting for


an NCAA berth," sophomore for-
ward Zack Novak (nine points) said.
"On the other end, we were start-
ing to working our way out (last
year), and then they embarrassed
us in overtime. So I said 'Hey, they
embarrassed us, so we've got to
fight and return the favor.'"
Sims and junior guard Manny
Harris played solidly all night
despite heavy defensive pressure
from the collapsing interior defense
of the Hawkeyes (9-18, 3-11). They
combined for 47 points on 17-of-
42 shooting. Harris finished with
20 points, 10 rebounds and seven
assists.
He also tallied five points and
two rebounds in overtime, despite
playing the entire extra session
with four fouls.
"He doesn't foul much as it is,"
Beilein said. "In fact, he's got to
learn to play more aggressively
and still not foul. ... You worry
more about the charges with him
than you worry about fouling on
defense."
The win marks the first time
the Wolverines have tallied back-
to-back road wins this season.
Having put in solid 40-minute
efforts away from home twice in
the past five days, the players' con-
fidence is swelling with five games
left on the schedule.
But despite the wire-to-wire
drama, there was stillmroom for
caution anidst the optimism.
"We're getting better," Beilein
said. "Whether it's good enough
to continue and keep winning, I
don't know."

Michigan coach Red Berenson has led the Wolverines to19 straight NCAA Tournaments, but maybe not this year.
Withfour ames left, Michigan

It hasn't been a black and white
season for the Michigan hockey
team, to say the least.

of scoring chances, the follow-
ing series the

was suspect.
If the team

a game, leave
it to someone MARK
to take an ill- BURNS
advised pen-
alty and cost
the team a win. And all bets are
off if the Wolverines could string
together a few weekends of solid
defensive hockey.
Through 33 games, the Wol-
verines have compiled a sub-par
17-15-1 overall record, just good
enough for seventh in the CCHA.
And with four games remaining
in conference play, it's despera-
tion time for a team that had lofty
expectations. One weekend they
look like a team that could play
with anyone in the country. Other
weekends, well, they look like a
team poised to finish in the bot-
tom tier of the CCHA.
And despite the five-game losing
streak in mid-November, the loss
to RPI (who?) in the first round
of the GLI and two series sweeps

more than the last two years com-
bined, the Wolverines still have the
opportunity to gain a first-round
bye in the CCHA Tournament and
make the NCAA field of 16 for the
20th-straight year.
Is it far-fetched for an underper-
forming team? Eh, probably. But
could it potentially happen? Yes.
Would I be surprised if it did, in
fact, occur? No.
I've been scratching my head
for the last few months trying to
decipher what went wrong with
this Red Berenson team that had so
much promise.
It returned a core group of play-
ers, led by senior captain Chris
Summers, junior forwards Louie
Caporusso and Carl Hagelin along
with goaltender Bryan Hogan.
And after finishing in second place
at the end of the previous regular
season, the likelihood of contend-
ing for a regular season title for the
second time in three years looked
that much better.
After Michigan finished the
first half of the season with a 10-10
record and a third-place finish
at the Great Lakes Invitational,
a conference title was out of the
question.
But over the next 11 days, Michi-
gan will square-off against North-
ern Michigan - currently situated
in fifth place - and Notre Dame,
which sits in 10th. And three of
those contests are in the friendly
confines of Yost Ice Arena, with the

final game of the season in South
Bend. The Wolverines are 7-0-1
since Thanksgiving in front of the
Michigan faithful and couldn't be
in a better position to clinch a top-
four position in the CCHA.
So, Michigan can forget about its
past failures, its handful of upsets
and inability to rise to the top of
the CCHA.
Because, with two sweeps or
even three wins, the Wolver-
ines would finish in the top four.
You're probably thinking, 'Well,
that sounds a lot easier said than
done.' And while you're right to
an extent, Michigan has the tools
necessary to reach the NCAA
Tournament.
It's led by one of the most
respected and revered coaches in
all of Division I college hockey,
whose two National Champion-
ships and 10 Frozen Four appear-
ances speak volumes about his
coaching. Caporusso, a Hobey
Baker Award finalist last year,
looks like he has found his stride
down the stretch, scoring four
goals in as many games.
And if Hogan can play up to his
potential, there's no telling how far
this team.could go.
How's that for black and white? 0

able life, but I wanted to make a differ-
ence in the lives of others who wanted
a chance to escape the wretched grasp
of poverty.
In March 2008, while I was an
electrical engineering undergraduate
student at Kettering University, the
deputy director of the Boston Rede-
velopment Authority asked me . to
design a solar panel system for remote
villages in Guinea, West Africa. I had
no experience in solar energy systems
but was enthusiastic about the idea,
and so I accepted the opportunity. I
told a friend of mine - Abdrahamane
Traore, who is a native of the west
African country, Mali - who shared
my excitement, and after nine months
of sleepless nights and

oming from Bangladesh, one
of the poorest countries in the
world, I've seen the extremes
of life. Though I'm blessed to be part
of a family where education, diligence
and decency are high priorities, I've
also had the opportunity to view life
from different perspectives: the dark-
ness of a poor, uneducated life that my
father's side of the family faces on a
daily basis, and the glamor of prosper-
ity my mother's side has always expe-
rienced.
I often used to visit my paternal
family in their villages, the pungent
smell of burning kerosene lamps
wafting through the air as hopeful
students struggled to squint through
what little light they had in an attempt
to read their schoolbooks. Despite
their abject poverty and lack of mod-
ern technological advances, the
inhabitants of these villages always
seemed to radiate happiness even as
they endured the smell of cow dung
and the pouring rain of monsoon

a business."
Alumnus Emily Weingarten's atten-
tion to entrepreneurship also began
aVehe University. While attending the
School of Music, Theater and Dance
for a degree in bassoon performance
and musicology, Weingarten joined
Arts Enterprise, a University group
that promotes the interaction between
art and business - and especially art
and entrepreneurship.
Weingarten emphasized that orga-
nizations like Arts Enterprise are
viTally important in the recession.

Arts Enterprise members, because we

place in the world we are used to are
completely foreign in these places -
electricity is a dream for some and
unknown to many. As I left the village
of Rangunia, Chittagong, Bangladesh
in 1995, I had no idea that one day I
might return, bringing a light of hope
with me.
When I moved to the United States
in 1995, I began to experience a luxu-
rious life, the other side of what I had
lived as a child in a kerosene-pow-
ered village. My family was success-
ful in their chosen fields: my father
is a Ph.D. in civil engineering, my
mother is a doctor of gynecology and
obstetrics, my eldest brother and his
wife and my sister and her husband
are doctors, my second brother is an
electrical engineer and his wife is a
Harvard-educated doctor of pathol-
ogy. Our household is continually
full of intellectual conversations
with people from diverse fields of
study and I've always been encour-

aged to aspire tobe the best. My fam-
ily seemed to be living the American
dream, the ideal of success and pros-
perity.
But even with my comfort in
America, somewhere deep within my
heart I always remembered the face
of a hungry child back in Bangladesh

the world. We understood that expen-
sive, large- scale systems weren't the
solution; portable and affordable solu-
tions were the answer.
Late last year, Abdrahamane and I
developed a simple, portable solution
that uses clean solar energy to pro-
vide lighting at night and electricity
for basic electronics. Most students in
Bangladesh need lighting at night to
study, which is currently provided for
by expensive and unreliable kerosene
lamps. Families also need enough
electricity to charge their cellular
phones, rather than traveling several
miles to the nearest phone charging
station.
After proving the plausibility of
our concept through the first pro-
totype, we won the 1,000 Pitches
Competition, the largest on-campus
entrepreneurship competition in the
country. One month later, we won
the Alternative Energy Competition
as well.
We are inspired to make a differ-
ence by providing hope to people in
poor countries while ensuring a posi-
tive cash flow company. By utilizing
the talents and aspirations deep with-
in us, we realized that it was possible
to truly make a positive difference in
the world.

After she graduated from the Uni-
versity in 2008, Weingarten got a job
at The Colburn School's music con-
servatory in Los Angeles. But she soon
decided it wasn't for her after realizing
it lacked the entrepreneurial aspects
she sought in a career. Weingarten
then returned to Michigan, joining
Arts Enterprise as a chapter devel-
opment specialist when it became a
national non-profit based in Ypsilanti
last year.
In addition to promoting entrepre-
neurial ventures among musicians
and artists, Weingarten is helping to
develop a venture around creATE, her
healthy living blog accessible through
AnnArbor.com.
She said she's not yet sure how to
turn the blog into a revenue venture,
but said she's thinking of writing a
cookbook or publishing articles. Wein-
garten said she values her contin-
ued ties to Arts Enterprise because it

encourages her to think entrepreneur-
ially.
"The great thing about Arts Enter-
prise is it empowered me to say, 'Well,
I have this idea, and there's got to be
some way that I can develop it," she
said.
Michael Mauskapf, executive direc-
tor of the University's Arts Enterprise
chapter and musicology graduate stu-
dent, elaborated on the importance of
promoting entrepreneurial thinking.
"Sometimes we take for granted
that artists are automatically entre-
preneurial," he said. "But a lot of art-
ists, especially undergrad students,
are caught in the middle of schoolwork
and practice room, and they just find
themselves kind of isolated. So we try
to provoke and instigate their entre-
preneurial side."
Though some students were pushed
toward entrepreneurship by a blend of
University support and personal inter-
est, others began startups from pure
necessity.

When Eric Garcia, a graduate
student in the School of Informa-
tion, began looking for an internship
required by the Master of Science in
Information program for the summer
of 2009, he was hesitant about avail-
able opportunities.
"Last summer it was really difficult
to find a good position at a good com-
pany," Garcia explained. "No one went
to Google, we had one person go to
Apple - the numbers were really low."
Garcia, along with three fellow
students decided to enter a business
idea into RPM10, a 10-week summer
internship program - resources and
capital included - that RPM Ventures
offers to University students with orig-
inal business ideas.
"We submitted this really vague
idea that we would build a mobile
social game, and they liked it and we
won, so that got us a good chunk of
money, office space and basically the
whole summer to design a game," he
said.

The internship program fulfilled
the requirement at the School of
Information, which was "a life saver"
for Garcia, and the team lived off the
$20,000 grant while developing their
startup, Phonagle, and its first game,
OutWord - an interactive, geographi-
cal word game similar to Scrabble.
Though the company is now trying
to decide whether the venture can be
profitable, a mobile app that has 10,000
downloads and world-wide users is a
long way from where Garcia was when
he graduated from the University with
a B.A. in Spanish in 2006.
Garcia echoes the sentiments of
many University students who ulti-
mately decided to forgo career plans
to take the riskier move and start a
company. And, like most, he said he
wouldn't change anything about how
his life has shaped up after gradua-
tion.
"I never thought in my life that I
would have started my own company,"
he said. "I've fallen in love with it."

random.student interview

Yo. Is this Nicholas?
Yep.
Nicholas, this is Trevor
Calero. I'm calling from The Mich-
igan Daily for the Random Student
Interview.
Yep.
You mind if I ask you a few ques-
tions? It'll just take a couple of
minutes.
No. That's fine.
So how are you doing Nicholas?
Pretty good.
Where are you right now?
In my dorm room.
Uh ... what are you doing in your
dorm room on Valentines Day?
Right now, I'm actually studying for
an Econ test.
You don't have a hot date later?
[Laughs] I do not.
Oh. You and me both Nicholas.
I wish I did 'cause they're serving
Chinese in the cafeteria tonight.
[Laughs] Do most of your friends
have dates?
Yeah, a few of them do.
Does it bother you that you're

dateless on Valentines Day?
No. Not at all.
Have you ever had a date on Valen-
tines Day?
Yeah Ihave.
What was it like?
Um ... it was pretty standard.
What's standard?
Dinner and a movie.
OK. Is that standard or is that bor-
ing?
Uh ... I don't know. It can be boring if
you make it boring.
What movie did you see?
I don't even remember. It was two or
three years ago.
Oh ... but she's no more?
Nope.
Sorry about that Nicholas.
Ahh ... it's not a big deal.
What are most of your friends
doing that have dates today? Any-
thing special, or just the standard
dinner and a movie?
Pretty much standard. Nothing spe-
cial that I've heard of yet. I'll prob-
ably know afterward though.
You still have, like, I don't know,

six hours left. You gonna try to
find a date or just keep studying?
I'll probably just keep studying. Keep
the priorities straight.
Right, good for you Nicholas. So
have you ever heard of ChatRou-
lette?
Yeah. Sure.
OK. Can we talk about that for a
couple of minutes? Because it just
blew my mind when I found out
about it this weekend.
Yeah, sure.
How did you first hear about Cha-
tRoulette?
Uh ... my sister is all about it.
Did it shock you, the overwhelm-
ing amount of dick that is on that
website?
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
Have you ever met anyone inter-
esting?
I've met a few people that know peo-
ple from my hometown. And I met a
few kids who knew a kid who lives on
the floor below me. But that's about it.
When did you first find out about
it?

Probably about a month ago.
Do you still go on it at all?
No.
OK. You should try. It might be a
good way to pick up a date for Val-
entines Day.
[Laughs] I might give ita shot.
I was talking to this guy for about,
I don't know, an hour the other
day. He was from Chile and he was
giving me advice on what I should
do with my life. He was pretty nice.
[Laughs]
And then I met this other guy,
he was from New York City. He
was with his uncle. But after his
uncle left he was, like, 'let me
show you my rubber band ball.'
And I thought that was code for
'I'm gonna whip my dick out.' But
he actually pulled out this two-
foot wide rubber band ball. I was
shocked.
Ahh, that's ridiculous.

a date on ChatRoulette.

temporarily-paralyzing identity cri-
sis the forced match making had
commenced. I mentally prepared
myself for the encounters to begin,
but as girls outnumbered boys about
two to one, I was forced to sit out for
the first round of "dates." Instead I
observed the scene unfolding before
me: a row of boys facinga row of girls,
trying to connect with one another in
three-minute spans. Instead of name
tags, everyone wore numbers as a
form of identification.
Finally it was time for me, speed
dater number five, to enter the scene.
I found myself face-to-face with
a relatively harmless looking gradu-

Speed dating is one of those dis-
tant, bewildering topics I had
heard about vaguely through
watching bad sitcoms and reality
TV shows - I have never actually
known anyone who has participated.
It seemed like a very far-off and far-
fetched thing to do, perhaps as a sort
of sport for lonely thirty-somethings.
But when a good friend timidly
suggested a speed-dating event -
billed as "Just in time for Valen-
tines Speed-Dating" - being held at
the Michigan League, I impulsively
decided to check it out. It seemed like
a novel thing for us to do.
And who knows? Maybe my
dreamboat, a dead ringer for Leon-
ardo DiCaprio circa "Titanic," would
saunter through those double doors
in all his Members Only-jacketed
glory and sweep me away to a bet-
ter life filled with an endless assort-

afternoon tea parties with our new
BFFs and fellow power couple, David
Bowie and Iman.
If not, maybe the experience would
at least be good for some laughs and
serve as a funny dinner party anec-
dote down the road.
So with some trepidation, my
friend and I made our way to the
Henderson Room. Lady Gaga's "Bad
Romance" blared from someone's
laptop as a few boys awkwardly stood
together in a corner feasting on the
complimentary Valentine-themed
jellybeans. The male-to-female ratio
was severely distorted, with the
majority of attendees possessing XX
chromosomes. And yet, the room
seemed remarkably empty.
As we had arrived before the offi-

didn't connect with anyone. I felt like
a misshapen part on an assembly line,
spewing useless bits of trivia while I
imagined the seasoned veterans ronj
ing their eyes behind my back.
But then I realized that maybe it
wasn't such a bad thing that I didn't
know how to conduct myself prop-
erly in the sphere of speed dating.
Speed dating, as I see it, is sup-
posed to be somewhat of a one-time
thing. There is a lot of cultural shame
associated with speed dating - it's
often seen as a mark of failure or
viewed as an inability to relate to real
people to the point that individuals
are forced to seek out the company of
total strangers instead of interacting
with the people in their lives.
Speed dating is not organic in the
way that most friendships and rela-
tionships are - there's a definite
sense of artificiality in the process.
I had positioned myself in a very
open way, interacting candidly with
strangers, and the whole experience
had been incredibly surreal. To be
honest, I thought the whole thipg
was kind of sad.
My feelings were especially com-
pounded given that the event was
positioned against Valentine's Day,
the most synthetic holiday of all -
the speed dating seemed twice as
depressing as it might have had it
not been advertised as a remedy for
a lonely Valentine's Day. U

It was announced last week that
President Barack Obama will be

sity's spring commencement. His
speech will mark the fourth time a
United States president has deliv-
ered the graduation speech.


"If you look at any of the successful entrepre-
neurial towns across the country, Ann Arbor has
the exact same setup," Leland said. "The Bay
Area, or Boston or Boulder, Colorado, they have
large research universities, they have a campus
that's interlaced with commercial business and
they have educated, interesting, motivated peo-
ple. So the University of Michigan is really going
to drive this spark for more entrepreneurship."
MPowered hosts numerous events during the
year that bring attention to entrepreneurship, but
what it's most well-known for is the 1,000 Pitches
Competition and the Career Fair, which features
startups and small companies.
The 1,000 Pitches Competition,. which
prompts students to proffer business ideas
through recorded videos, drew 2,165 pitches this
fall - double the number from the year before.
The Career Fair also saw record numbers in Jan-
uary with 80 startups showcased at the event and
an estimated 2,000 attendees.
Klinke considers this vital to the student
entrepreneurial movement on campus.
"The MPowered student group is really key to
our success," she said. "Because if an old person
like me talks about entrepreneurship, it's just,
like, 'What do I know?' But if one of your peers
talks about it, it can make it more exciting."
THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED
This amplified attention to entrepreneur-
ship has motivated more University students to
dive into startups, but the recession continues
to be one of the biggest factors drawing student
interest. With inherent instability in both career-
track jobs and entrepreneurial ventures, students
are becoming more willing to take on the risks
associated with entrepreneurship, and delve
head first into a new project or startup.
University alum Jason Bornhorst started two
companies in the last two years and joined a
startup company based in TechArb.
The 23-year-old graduated with a bachelor's
degree in computer science engineering from the
University in December, but his involvement in
startups began long before graduation.
"As I was coming up on graduation, I definitely

wasn't looking forward to searching for a job,
and I figured that my prospects would probably
be grim," Bornhorst said. "As a newly graduated
university student, you have the ability to take
on quite a bit of risk, and in that sense it makes
complete sense to go work for a startup or to start
your own company."
Though initial startups often fold, Bornhorst
explained that failure is OK. He could always
start over, he said, and apply the lessons learned
to the next endeavor. -
"It's multitudes more worth it than going to get
some entry-level job atsome company - and that's
even assuming you can get that job," he said.
Bornhorst said he draws his knowledge from
experience. In the summer of 2008, he began his
first startup, a social networking site called Cam-
pus Roost, with a $25,000 grant from the Univer-
sity. The startup ultimately failed, but Bornhorst
took those lessons, which he said could fill an
entire book, and applied them to his subsequent
ventures.
After Campus Roost, Bornhurst set off to
develop DoGood, a non-profit iPhone applica-
tion that tracks the daily "good deeds" of its
users. Since its creation, the application has been
downloaded 70,000 times, generating more than
300,000 "good deeds" to date.
When a Minnesota-based mobile applica-
tion company, Mobiata, moved to Ann Arbor six
months ago, Bornhorst joined the company as an
engineer. Mobiata exceeded $1 million in revenue
its first year, and its mobile travel apps - includ-
ing FlightTrack, HotelPal and TripDeck - have
been featured in high-profile technology publica-
tions, television commercials and have all been in
the top five in the iPhone travel application store
at some point.
Now that the company has shown it can
be profitable, it will soon need to move out of
TechArb. But Bornhorst sees a strong future with
Mobiata and Ann Arbor, noting that companies
like these are needed for the city.
"Large companies grow and get big, and then
because of that they slow down, and it's a great
opportunity for smaller, more agile startups,
such as student businesses, to identify a need and
