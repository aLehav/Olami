The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
along with the Michigan State 
University 
chapter 
and 
the 

Michigan Federation of College 
Democrats, is suing the state over 
two of its voter ID and registration 
laws. The suit claims the laws 
unconstitutionally 
restrict 
a 

citizen’s 26th Amendment right 
to vote, particularly for young 
voters and students.

The 
suit 
concerns 
two 

laws, 
Michigan 
Public 
Act 

118 and Michigan Compiled 
Laws 168.509t(2), which the 
organizations 
claim 
make 

voting 
more 
difficult 
and 

time-consuming and in turn, 
discourage voters from casting 

their ballots.

Public Act 118 requires the 

voter’s residence on their voter 
registration 
card 
to 
match 

their residence on their driver’s 
license. The Michigan Compiled 
Laws statute requires voters who 
register through a third party or 
by mail to vote in-person for their 
first-time vote.

According to a press release by 

the plaintiffs, the complaint was 
filed by Perkins Coie LLP and 
MSU law professor Mark Totten 
and outlined the claims from 
College Democrats alleging the 
laws add to the general confusion 
about voting and discourage 
young voters.

“(Y)oung voters in Michigan 

have 
faced 
unequal 
and 

consequential 
barriers 
in 

registering to vote and voting

Dozens of former customers accuse owner of white supremacy, sexual harrassment

Now that Ann Arbor business 

Pangea Piercing has officially closed 
its doors for good –– the result of a 

massive outcry against the behavior 
of owner J.C. Potts, which many say 
constitutes abuse, sexism, and white 
supremacy –– community members 
are thinking about how best to fill 
now-empty space, and ensure that 
Potts is not able to continue his 
piercing career elsewhere.

After an August 21st tweet from 

user @LauraStroudd went viral, 
describing a situation in which 
Potts 
repeated 
several 
white 

supremacist talking points to her 
during a piercing, Alice Held, 
another previous customer, shared 
her own experiences with Potts, 
as well as similar experiences of 
over 30 others she had collected. 

Complaints 
range 
from 
racist, 

sexist and transphobic comments to 
sexual harassment while customers 
were getting piercings. Many others 
expressed their concerns with the 
safety and professionalism of the 
process, mentioning scarring and 
pain. During one piercing, Held

After a summer of meetings 

with the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs and 

various 
University 
officials 

and departments, the Latinx 
Alliance 
for 
Community 

Action, Support and Advocacy 
and 
MESA 
representatives 

say progress has been made 
on short-term requests and 

conversations 
about 
larger, 

institutional 
demands 
are 

moving in the right direction. 
Last 
February, 
La 
Casa 

sent a list of demands to 
the University of Michigan 
administration 
addressing 

a 
lack 
of 
representation 

and support for the Latinx 
community on campus.

La Casa, an organization 

of students and faculty at the 
University, works to provide 
support and facilitate a positive 
environment for all Latinx 
students on campus looking for 
more support.

La Casa’s demands, which 

were 
emailed 
directly 
to 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert and others, called 
specifically for an increase in 
Latinx staff and faculty hires, 
Latinx senior administration 
hires, additional funding for 
the Latina/o Studies program 
and La Casa, the installment 
of Latinx-identified spaces on 
campus and more.

Though 
little 
concrete 

progress has been made on 
the larger demands including 
structural 
diversification 
of 

hiring processes to include 
more 
Latinx 
hirees 
and

contract expired May 29, 
and an agreement on a new 
contract was made June 22. 
The new contract went into 
effect in July.

The 
new 
contract 

comes 
after 
eight 

months 
of 
bargaining 

negotiations 
with 
the 

University. 
LEO’s 
efforts 

sparked 
support 
from 

students across the three 
campuses, and they also 
resulted in a vote to strike in 
April. LEO eventually called 
off 
the 
strike 
after 
an 

agreement was made with 
the 
University 
regarding 

salary increases.

LEO 
President 
Ian 

Robinson, 
a 
sociology 

lecturer, said that though 
LEO did not get everything 
it 
had 
asked 
for, 
the 

negotiations were overall 
successful.

“It’s a terrific contract,” 

Robinson 
said. 
“It 
fell 

short in a couple of areas, 
but compared to where we 
were coming from (with) 
the baseline before this 
contract, it’s terrific.”

According to LEO’s blog, 

the organization believes 
this 
contract 
agreement 

is a historic victory for its 
members and allies.

“We believe that we have 

won historic gains in these 
negotiations, 
including 

significant salary increases, 
improved 
benefits, 
and 

stronger 
protections 
for 

Lecturer 
job 
security,” 

LEO’s 
bargaining 
team 

wrote in the post.

By 2021, the contract 

minimum 
salary 
will 

increase by $16,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $13,700 in Flint 
and $12,700 in Dearborn. 
Equity 
adjustments, 
or 

one-time additions to base 
pay, would also increase by 
$3,000 to $12,500. Equity 
will differ for lecturers 
earning more than $80,000 
annually.

for the first time,” the complaint 
read. “Indeed, in many cases, these 
laws have resulted in a chilling 
effect that has kept eligible young 
voters in Michigan from voting 
and registering to vote entirely 
due to widespread confusion about 
the laws’ requirements and legal 
effects.”

Marc Elias, a partner at Perkins 

Coie, is one of the plaintiff’s 
lawyers. Elias, who served as 
general counsel to Hillary Clinton’s 
2016 presidential campaign, also 
represented a group of college 
students 
in 
Florida 
in 
their 

successful suit to remove a ban on 
early voting on college campuses. It 
was the first time a judge ruled that 
a policy constituted discrimination 
under the 26th Amendment.

Ingham County Clerk Barb 

Byrum supported the plaintiffs 
in the suit, declaring in a press 
release Michigan has “some of the 
toughest and unnecessary voting 

restrictions in the country.”

“These restrictions have had a 

devastating impact on the ability 
of students voters to exercise 
their right to vote for more than a 
decade,” Byrum wrote.

MSU student Eli Pales, president 

of 
MSU’s 
College 
Democrats, 

addressed specific ways the suit 
files believe the aforementioned 
laws negatively impact voters on 
their campus. Pales said the “First 
Time/In-Person 
Requirement” 

directly inhibits students who 
moved long distances to attend 
MSU from voting in their home 
precincts.

“This is obviously a huge 

detriment to a lot of students who 
registered at home, maybe at a 
high school registration drive or 
whatever it is, come to Michigan 
State University and can’t vote 
unless they drive home,” Pales 
said. “Here at Michigan State 
University, for the first year, you’re 
not allowed to have a car on campus 
which essentially means if you’re 
registered at home and you need to 
get home to vote, you need a parent 

to come to the University, pick you 
up, bring you back to vote, and then 
drop you back off which would take 
hours and hours of a parent’s day.”

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Kellie 

Lounds, 
president 
of 
U-M’s 

College Democrats, agreed, adding 
that in addition to the logistical 
hurdles the laws placed in the 
way of student voters, they made 
the 
process 
confusing, 
which 

ultimately discourages voting.

“I myself have encountered 

complications while registering 
voters in seeing other students 
be unsure as to whether they 
can actually register with their 
campus addresses and what the 
consequences of changing their 
driver’s 
license 
address 
are,” 

Lounds wrote in an email to 
The Daily. “It’s a fairly common 
confusion and this law makes it 
unnecessarily complex for students 
to exercise their right to vote.”

will be prepared for key senior 
roles in a variety of governmental 
institutions and public agencies, 
in the non-public sector and in the 
private sector as well.”

The 33-credit degree will be 

open to individuals with five or 
more years of experience in public 
administration, government affairs, 
the military or the nonprofit sector. 
The Public Policy School has 
developed new courses specifically 
for this program, in addition, these 
MPA students will enroll in courses 
which are part of the school’s 
current Master of Public Policy 
program, including Economics for 
Public Affairs and Leadership in 
Public Affairs. In order to complete 
the degree, students must also 
complete a capstone project for a 
client. The new program builds 
upon the former Master of Public 
Administration 
by 
combining 

the previous degree’s focus on 
analytical policy analysis with 

new curriculums for public and 
nonprofit entity management.

This 
curriculum, 
combined 

with a faculty of experts in fields 
ranging from economics to social 
work, will focus on refining the 
skills of professionals in the field 
and prepare them for leadership 
positions within and outside of the 
government. 

“The new degree program builds 

upon the strengths of the Master 
of Public Administration degree 
while providing some new and 
innovative learning opportunities 
that are tailored to experienced 
professionals,” Barr wrote. “We are 
grateful to our alumni of the Master 
of Public Administration degree for 
their input as we develop this new 
program.”

Paula 
Lantz, 
professor 
and 

associate dean for academic affairs 
at the Public Policy School, said 
the school decided to update their 
program to strengthen it and 
broaden their reach to domestic and 
international students.

“The impetus behind this new 

degree was the desire to strengthen 

our reduced-credit master’s degree 
offering for people with significant 
work experience,” Lantz said. “We 
are very excited about this new 
degree offering, which we believe 
will attract people with work 
experience and an interest in public 
affairs around the world.”

Lantz 
explained 
the 
new 

program has the potential to expand 
into an executive learning format.

“Eventually we are going to 

take this degree into an executive 
format which will combine online 
and in-person learning,” Lantz 
said. “In the future, it will also be 
in an executive format and will be 
available to people working full-
time.”

Lantz said though this program 

is one of at least seven other Master 
of Public Administration degrees in 
Michigan, the Public Policy School 
will be the only Master of Public 
Affairs in Michigan and one of few 
in the country.

said Potts made reference to her 
breasts, saying she was “blessed,” 
and used the N-word. In an earlier 
instance, when she was 14, Held 
said Potts prohibited her father 
from being present in the room 
during a piercing, though nothing 
else inappropriate occurred.

“I’m very involved in the body 

modification 
community 
in 

general, and I want that to be a very 
safe place, and it’s not with this guy 
being in business,” Held said. “So, 
my biggest goal is I obviously don’t 
want him to be piercing in Ann 
Arbor or anywhere, so making 
sure –– keeping tabs on where he 
goes next is probably my biggest 
thing that I wanna focus on.”

University doctorate student 

Abby Lamb also said he brought 
up 
topics 
she 
considered 

inappropriate 
during 
the 

procedure.

“JC started out with polite, 

normal small talk about my 
work,” Lamb said. “But as soon 
as he discovered I’m a genetics 
researcher he started going on 
about ‘the genetic correlation 
between aggression and skin 
pigment,’ which is complete non-
scientific nonsense peddled by 
white supremacists to justify their 
views.”

Lamb emphasized Potts put her 

in a “creepy and uncomfortable 
situation,” 
where 
she 
didn’t 

feel like she could respond to or 
challenge his beliefs.

“He was in the process of 

changing 
my 
piercing 
when 

this came up, and I didn’t feel 
comfortable or safe objecting 
while he was handling my facial 
piercing,” Lamb explained. “He 
basically took advantage of my 
vulnerability and his position of 
relative power to both mansplain 
my field of research to me while 
trying to preach that dark skinned 
people are naturally violent.”

Following 
the 
viral 
posts, 

protesters showed up at Pangea 
Piercing 
with 
printed 
copies 

of victim statements and signs 
accusing Potts of being a Nazi. Potts 
then posted a video statement to 

Pangea Piercing’s official Youtube 
channel defending his views and 
announcing the business’s closing.

“I’ve talked about challenging 

topics and for the ultra-sensitive 
activist types, I’m sure that I 
can sound like some ‘Trumpian’ 
figure,” Potts said in his statement. 
“With a little twist and some 
embellishment, it might finally be 
the ‘actual racism’ that Ann Arbor 
has been so desperately searching 
for.”

Since Potts confirmed the 

business would be closing, Jessica 
Prozinski, 
a 
founder 
of 
the 

grassroots activist organization 
Stop Trump Ann Arbor, has talked 
with people from local businesses 
like Gamma Piercing and Eternal 
Ink about opening a new piercing 
gallery or tattoo parlor in the 
space.

“Initially I was thinking it 

would be cool if it was another 
piercing place with an owner that 
would be almost the reverse,” 
Prozinski said. “Obviously we 
don’t have the legal power to 
decide what goes next there, but 
socially we have a lot of power.”

Stop Trump Ann Arbor is 

also proposing additions to the 
Association 
of 
Professional 

Piercers’ “Piercee’s Bill of Rights,” 
which would assert that people 
undergoing piercing procedures 
have the right to not be sexualized 
or otherwise objectified in the 
piercing environment, and to have 
a friend or relative present in the 
same room during the piercing.

 “The person I talked to was 

shocked that J.C. discouraged 
people from having somebody 
come into the piercing room with 
them, including, in at least two 
cases, minor women,” Prozinski 
said.

According to Potts, his own 

career “is over.” In his video 
statement, 
however, 
Potts 

indicated 
he 
would 
continue 

posting videos to Youtube to 
discuss the topics surrounding his 
allegations.

“I’ve said quite a few times 

that I wish we, as white people, 
could ever have anything like 
representation for our interests 
that wasn’t Richard Spencer or 
David Duke,” he said. “Well, my 
career is over, so I will not be 

bringing you any more piercing 
content, but seeing as how I guess 
some of these conversations need 
to happen, then I guess we’ll be 
probably checking in with more 
videos in the future, just definitely 
not on this channel.”

Prozinski said the video made 

her worry Potts might try to turn 
himself “into some sort of white 
nationalist figure.”

Potts 
has 
also 
threatened 

legal action against some of the 
customers who have made claims 
against him, though Prozinski and 
Held don’t believe the threats are 
serious. Replying to the original 
viral tweet, Held posted an eight-
second video sent to her by another 
customer, in which Potts can 
be heard saying, “A lot of really 
powerful folks out there doing 
what they can to convince white 
folks not to breed. Okay? And if 
they do, breed with a black man…”

In response, Potts tweeted, 

“RELEASE THE REST OF THE 
VIDEO OR LAWYER UP. This is 
part of a 2 minute monologue that 
I KNEW YOU WERE FILMING. I 
remember you guys.”

Held 
said 
the 
situation 

reminded her of another in which 
dozens of people accused Detroit-
area tattoo artist Alex Boyko of 
sexual assault and harassment. 
Boyko then filed a defamation suit 
against another tattoo artist who 
he said was responsible for the 
flood of accusations.

Last month was not the first 

time Potts’s behavior has been 
called into question, however. 
Yelp reviews dating back as 
far as 2010 describe Potts as 
“bizarrely rude,” “shady,” and 
“intimidating,” 
recommending 

future customers avoid him. 
Several reviews also indicate 
customers experienced Potts as 
being racist. In a review from 
April 13, 2010, a customer wrote, 
“... my best friend told me that 
while she was there she heard 
the owner and one of the piercers 
guffawing over the fact that the 
piercer had messed with a couple 
of Indian women who had come 
in recently.”

expressed her optimism for the 
conversations with MESA and 
the University moving forward.

“We are moving in a positive 

direction,” Rivas said. “We 
understand that there’s a lot of 
demands that can’t be solved 
in a certain timeframe. They 
require time, so I think we’ve 
been understanding on that end 
because (the administration) 
have been addressing the ones 
that are more immediate or 
easier to tackle.”

MESA director Nadia Bazzy 

confirmed in an email the 
organization has met with La 
Casa and wrote the University 
is focused on concrete solutions 
to the demands proposed by La 
Casa.

“Student Life leadership has 

met with La Casa on an ongoing 
basis 
since 
the 
demands,” 

Bazzy wrote. “The goal has 
been to listen, dialogue and 
deliver actionable items to 
strengthen partnerships and 
community.”

One of the initial demands 

called 
for 
full 
financial 

support for Assisting Latin@s 
to Maximize Achievement, a 
program designed to provide 
incoming 
Latinx 
students 

with necessary resources and 
support once they arrive at the 
University. La Casa specified it 
wanted ALMA to start prior to 
the official University move-
in date to avoid conflicts with 
other orientation programs.

According to LSA senior 

Yezeñia 
Sandoval, 
external 

director of La Casa, ALMA 
celebrated 18 years last week 
with additional support from 
MESA, 
which 
has 
led 
to 

increased support for incoming 
Latinx students. 

“(ALMA) 
really 

demonstrated the University’s 
commitment and leadership 
to helping La Casa grow and 
expand and helping recruit 
and retain Latinx incoming 
students, so I feel like they’ve 

really been pivotal in helping 
create action plans so that 
across campus, different offices 
can really cater their services 
to the diverse community that 
they serve,” Sandoval said.

With regard to the action 

plans, 
Sandoval 
and 
Rivas 

mentioned a pending joint press 
release from La Casa and the 
University about the status of 
the demands. Rivas said a few 
of the initiatives the University 
has been currently working on 
include the reinstallation of the 
previously removed art from 
the César Chávez Lounge in 
the Mosher-Jordan Residence 
Hall and an increased effort in 
diversified job applicant pools.

According 
to 
Sandoval 

and Rivas, the lack of Latinx 
representation in faculty and 
staff positions is still one of 
La Casa’s central demands. 
While 2017’s Hispanic/Latino 
student population sat near 6 
percent, data from the Office 
of Budget and Planning for 
2017 shows the percentage 
of 
Hispanic/Latino 
regular 

instructional faculty — which 
includes tenure-track faculty, 
non-tenure-track faculty and 
lecturers — was 3.97 percent. 

Sandoval 
said 
the 
low 

number 
of 
Latinx 
faculty 

members is a result of the 
applicant pools. While La Casa 
claimed the pools have seen an 
increase in diversity, Sandoval 
argues it isn’t enough.

“Outreach is a big (focus 

area) too because it’s not 
enough to just make sure 
applicant pools are diverse 
enough but it’s also important 
to make sure what outlets are 
we reaching out to (and) how 
else are we expanding and 
including 
the 
community?” 

Sandoval said.

Sandoval 
suggested 

the Professional Latino/as at 
UM Alliance , a network of staff 
and faculty at the University 
whose 
missions 
include 

furthering Latinx culture and 
increasing 
Latinx 
presence 

on campus, should receive 
further utilization. Sandoval 
said PLUMA should be notified 

of job openings so additional 
qualified Latinx candidates can 
apply.

“There’s a lot of potential, 

there’s 
a 
lot 
of 
Latinx 

individuals 
out 
there 
that 

have these qualifications but 
are you seeking them out?” 
Sandoval said. “Holding others 
accountable and seeing where 
you’re posting these jobs (and) 
how are you reaching out to 
Latinx faculty and staff … is a 
big part of (the conversation).”

Moving 
into 
September, 

which is also Latinx Heritage 
Month, 
Bazzy 
said 
the 

University is allocating more 
financial support for La Casa’s 
Heritage Month activities, as 
well as funding for programs 
and 
better 
employment 

opportunities 
to 
ease 
the 

burden of tuition.

“MESA, 
La 
Casa, 
and 

other campus partners have 
been 
working 
throughout 

the 
summer 
to 
provide 

programming 
for 
the 

campus 
community,” 
Bazzy 

wrote. “MESA has secured 
increased 
funding 
for 
all 

heritage 
month 
programs, 

mentorship 
programs, 
and 

grants for students and student 
organizations 
for 
ongoing 

work on campus, as well as, 
increased 
the 
number 
of 

student jobs in MESA and the 
rate of pay to better support the 
campus community.”

As conversations on the 

demands continue, Rivas said 
the main goal will continue 
to help Latinx students at the 
University feel as though they 
are supported and accepted 
by their peers and academic 
institution.

“I am very optimistic about 

this coming year and all the 
progress that will be made, 
and I am always excited to see 
La Casa grow into the largest 
Latinx 
organization 
that 

supports all of our community 
members and makes them 
feel like they have a home at 
Michigan,” Rivas said.

Examining “Crazy Rich Asians”
“C

razy Rich Asians” has 
been a smash hit this 
summer. Not only 
are many of my Asian American 
peers hailing it as a fantastic movie 
that gives Asian Americans the 
representation they need, but it’s the 
first Hollywood film featuring an 
all Asian-American cast since “The 
Joy Luck Club,” which was released 
25 years ago. It’s not hard to see why 
so many people are excited about it.
The stars of the film are 
also aware of its impact. In an 
interview on “Jimmy Kimmel 
Live,” Awkwafina, who plays Peik 
Lin Goh in the movie, said about the 
lack of Asian Americans in films: 
“If you think about it ... a 25-year-
old adult is just walking around 
without representation.” She then 
went on to speak more about “Crazy 
Rich Asians,” saying that “it’s so 
impactful for Asian Americans. 
Asian Americans come out of the 
screenings, and they’re, you know, 
crying, and they don’t know exactly 
why. And I think it’s the power of 
representation.”
However, despite how easy it is 
to just praise “Crazy Rich Asians” 
as a film with representation, it’s 
important to examine the film 
not only from an Asian-American 
perspective, but also from the 
perspective of people who are of 
Asian descent, but not American.
I stumbled across a Facebook 
post 
by 
activist 
Sangeetha 
Thanapal, 
who 
criticized 
the 
movie. She wrote: “Singapore is a 
terribly racist country. The state 
embarked on a form of eugenics 
in the 1980s meant to displace its 
indigenous population and replace 
it with settler colonial Chinese 
people ... So when you celebrate 
this movie, ask yourself who 
you are complicit in erasing.” Her 
boldest statement, however, comes 
when 
she 
explicitly 
criticizes 
Asian Americans’ willingness to 
celebrate the movie’s cast: “CRA 
is set in Singapore and only has 
Chinese people in it. This isn’t 
new or refreshing, this is the 
EVERYDAY FUCKIN LIVES OF 
MINORITIES. It is only diversity 

FOR YOU.”
In an article he wrote in The 
Atlantic, Mark Tseng-Putterman 
explores 
the 
same 
kinds 
of 
problems with “Crazy Rich Asians” 
as Thanapal, stating that “while 
the cast includes a mix of Chinese, 
Japanese and Korean diaspora 
actors of various nationalities, 
besides Henry Golding (who is of 
Iban descent) it effectively excludes 
South and Southeast Asians despite 
their deep presence in Singaporean 
society.” He also points out that “the 
only South Asians that viewers can 
glimpse are in the roles of servants 
and guards.”

I 
admittedly 
don’t 
know 
anything about racial and cultural 
tensions in Singapore, and I haven’t 
even watched the movie yet. While 
some may argue that it’s simply a 
romantic comedy and such movies 
need not be taken seriously, it’s 
impossible 
to 
simultaneously 
praise a movie for its representation 
while blatantly ignoring its lack of 
representation in a non-American 
context. We can’t ignore that this 
film celebrates Chinese privilege 
and the oppression of Singaporeans 
in the same way that so many 
Hollywood films emphasize white 
privilege and completely disregard 
people of color.
It’s also incredibly problematic 
to praise a film’s representation 
by simply looking at the actors’ 
ethnicities: Casting a person of 
color means nothing if the depiction 
of their character serves the same 
purpose that excluding minorities 
does. People of color should not 
settle for simply having non-

white representation. We need to 
look beyond an actor’s race and 
examine the character: Do they 
embody harmful stereotypes, such 
as the “socially incompetent Asian 
American” or “angry Black woman” 
tropes? Does the character serve the 
role of being “one of the good ones” 
by catering to white expectations 
and distancing themselves from 
the “bad” people of color, as Tseng-
Putterman argues that “Crazy Rich 
Asians” is guilty of? Not asking 
ourselves these types of questions 
and instead mindlessly celebrating 
representation leaves us vulnerable 
to ignorance and complicity.
However, that is not to say 
that everyone who feels validated 
by “Crazy Rich Asians” should 
feel ashamed for liking it, and we 
certainly 
shouldn’t 
ignore 
the 
positive aspects of the movie. It 
makes sense that so many Asian 
Americans are so emotional about 
the film — we’re used to not seeing 
a single person of Asian descent in 
a leading role, much less an entire 
cast of them. We’re used to seeing 
Asian Americans being portrayed 
as unattractive characters who 
are 
almost 
always 
incredibly 
submissive and shy or nerdy and 
weird. “Crazy Rich Asians” defies 
these stereotypes with its cast of 
Asian American actors who all 
portray characters with actual 
personalities. It’s impossible to 
refer to any of them as “the Asian 
one” because they’re all Asian. 
This means that the audience has 
to actually see past the characters’ 
race and remember them for their 
other qualities.
Despite all of its great qualities, 
however, I’m wary of supporting 
a 
film 
that 
celebrates 
Asian 
Americans at the expense of other 
Asians. I probably will end up 
watching it illegally online or on 
Netflix, depending on where it 
becomes available first. Still, I don’t 
think I’ll end up idolizing the movie 
like so many of my peers have done. 
That’s a good thing.

The virtues of McCain

NOAH HARRISON | COLUMN

S

en. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
sadly passed away last 
week 
after 
a 
yearlong 
battle with brain cancer, marking 
the end of the illustrious life 
of one of the country’s most 
respected legislators. McCain’s 
death evoked widespread tribute 
that transcended partisan and 
ideological lines. Among the 
many who mourned McCain’s 
passing were several of his 
former rivals and opponents, 
including Joe Biden, George Bush 
and Barack Obama, the latter two 
of which delivered eulogies at 
his funeral. Though my political 
views and McCain’s diverged 
frequently, I too admire him and 
will miss the dignity, civility and 
integrity which came to define 
his career.
McCain 
brought 
ambition 
and fire to Washington, D.C., but 
he also brought character. Some 
of McCain’s most extraordinary 
moments came in the many 
instances in which he bucked 
party or popular opinion in his 
pursuit of decency, no matter the 
political cost. At a campaign rally 
during the 2008 presidential race, 
he famously rebuffed a woman 
who called then-Senator Barack 
Obama an “Arab” and another 
supporter who said he was 
“scared” of Obama’s supposed 
ulterior motives. A decade later, 
we 
can 
appreciate 
McCain’s 
decision to quell these baseless 
sentiments rather than exploit 
them for political gain as several 
others have.
McCain’s 
commitment 
to 
character and civility was not 
limited to the campaign trail. 
On Capitol Hill, he led the 
condemnation 
of 
torture 
and 
enhanced interrogation techniques 
by the CIA, drawing on his past 
experiences as a prisoner of war 
in Vietnam to affirm that morality 
is not malleable. He provided 

leadership on many legislative 
issues, 
including 
defense 
and 
national 
security 
issues, 
but 
also in areas less popular with 
his Republican colleagues, like 
campaign finance reform. His 
prioritization of duty ahead of 
political expediency occasionally 
put him at odds with his own 
party, such as with his “no” vote 
on the “skinny repeal” health 
care bill in 2017, which killed 
GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. 
Unlike several of his colleagues 
who also voiced severe concerns 
over that bill, McCain refused to 
bow to immense political pressure 
to support the bill, exemplifying 
his unyielding commitment to do 
what he thought was right and his 
refreshing disinterest in political 
ramifications. 
McCain 
was 
certainly an effective legislator, but 
he will be remembered not only 
for his accomplishments, but also 
for how he achieved them: with 
civility, candor and character.
Regrettably, these virtues are 
increasingly rare in our current 
political landscape. There seem 
to be few remaining members 
of Congress and public officials 
who command the bipartisan 
admiration and respect, much 
less to the extent that McCain 
did. In many ways, McCain’s 
death appears to mark the end of a 
broader era, as our nation’s politics 
continue a descent into bluster and 
rancor. The 2018 midterm elections 
serve as an exodus for many 
moderating, civil voices. Several 
Republicans with reputations for 
decorum, including Sen. Jeff Flake, 
R-Ariz., and Sen. Bob Corker, 
R-Tenn., are stepping down. On the 
Democratic side, few are retiring, 
but the party’s current civil war 
between the establishment and 
progressives has seen progressives 
supplant several more moderate 
Democrats, including incumbent 
Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., who was 

unseated by Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez. Ideological battles and 
heated campaigns are a staple of 
democracy and to be expected, 
but we must not let civility and 
character become relics of the past.
Regardless of how the midterms 
play out, Congress will have quite a 
few newcomers in 2019. Whether 
they embrace the sense of duty and 
honor embodied by John McCain 
or succumb to the incivility remains 
to be seen, but the early signs aren’t 
great. Kelli Ward, a former GOP 
primary candidate in Arizona’s 
Senate race, had the audacity to 
claim that McCain’s decision to end 
medical treatment was timed to 
hurt her campaign. At the state level, 
Kansas 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Kris Kobach allegedly hired staffers 
associated with white supremacist 
groups. In this era of American 
politics, demagogues are far more 
common, and often more successful, 
than principled statesmen.
John 
McCain’s 
legacy 
of 
putting country first is one that 
we must strive to recreate. In 
a way, it is paradoxical that 
we widely recognize McCain’s 
virtues yet routinely support 
those who fail to emulate them. 
Politicians who fail to rise above 
the 
fray 
legitimize 
extreme 
sentiments and contribute little 
to the national discussion.
Those who are unwilling to 
move beyond rhetoric, partisan 
loyalty and ideological crusades 
once in office are not worthy of 
our votes. One does not need to 
be a moderate or even a maverick 
to emulate the virtues of McCain. 
McCain leaves behind a void 
of decency and respect in our 
politics, and ultimately it is our 
responsibility to fill it.

Data protection is a national priority

ALEXANDER SATOLA | COLUMN

T

he tide is finally turning 
for 
consumer 
data 
protection in the United 
States, and though internet users 
may have been aware that their 
activity was being tracked online, 
recent developments have shown 
just how much personal data the 
tech industry collects and shares 
about its users. As people growing 
up in the turbulent digital age, 
college students are at the forefront 
of a sea of change in the future of 
big data.
In 
June, 
the 
California 
Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 
passed through the California 
legislature. 
The 
law 
offers 
consumers 
more 
transparency 
over the use and transfer of their 
personal data, including the right 
to know what types of information 
companies collect about them, 
as well as the recipients of that 
information. A pivotal provision 
in the bill is the “private right of 
action,” which permits consumer 
lawsuits in the case of a traditional 
data breach, such as the T-Mobile 
data breach in August that exposed 
the personal information of 2 
million people. The law, subject to 
amendments, will enter into effect 
in January 2020.
The legislation, however, is 
weak compared to the behemoth 
European 
Union-sponsored 
General 
Data 
Protection 
Regulation that entered into effect 
this May. It gives consumers an 
unprecedented amount of control 
over their personal data, how it is 
used and who is allowed to use it. 
Crucially, it lets regulators levy 
massive fines up to 20 million euros 
or 4 percent of global turnover — 
whichever is higher — if companies 
break the rules. Under prior 
legislation, Facebook was fined 
£500,000 (about $700,000) for its 
role in improperly transferring the 
private information of 87 million 
users to Cambridge Analytica, a 
political consulting firm. Under 
the GDPR, the fine would have 
been equal to four percent of global 
turnover, or, put more simply, £1.4 
billion (about $1.96 billion).
Facing these new regulatory 
threats, 
tech 
companies 
are 
intensifying legal action within 
an already massive framework. 
Facebook, for example, spent more 
on lobbying in the first quarter of 

2018 than ever before, dangling 
$3.3 million in front of lawmakers 
to influence policy, according to a 
Senate filing. Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg and his colleagues are 
lobbying Congress to draft a new 
federal data privacy law, one that 
would hopefully kill two birds with 
one stone: erasing the California 
legislation and putting in place 
regulations that are friendlier to 
their data mining practices.
If we have learned anything 
from the revelations of Cambridge 
Analytica, the use of targeted 
advertising to unfairly influence 
the 
2016 
presidential 
election 
and the irresponsibility of tech 
companies that process our personal 
information, then it is time we call for 
federal data protection without the 
outsized influence of Silicon Valley 
firms. American lawmakers should 
adopt data protection as a bipartisan 
priority because the practices of data 
mining run amok infringe on the 
liberties of ordinary Americans.
With the midterm elections 
fast approaching, citizens would 
benefit from an overarching data 
protection law. The need for 
such a law is evident, especially 
after a CNN report revealed that 
Russian-linked 
Facebook 
ads 
targeted residents of Michigan 
and Wisconsin in key demographic 
areas during the 2016 election. 
The anonymous sources in the 
report indicated the ads filled 
people’s 
feeds 
with 
racially-
tinged and anti-Muslim rhetoric. 
While there is nothing illegal 
about targeted advertising, when 
a company like Facebook allows 
the weaponization of its platform 
by 
a 
foreign 
government 
to 
influence our elections, its apathy 
is an affront to democracy. In a 
country built upon the liberty of 
the individual, tech companies’ 
treatment of their customers as 
bottomless pits of data is nothing 
less than exploitation.
Lawmakers should thus be 
skeptical of any proposal floated 
to them by an industry lobbyist. 
Facebook lobbyist Joel Kaplan 
warned the California law could 
spread to other states and act 
as a threat to the industry and a 
regulatory nightmare. To be fair, 
state legislatures would needlessly 
torture companies if they each 
implemented 
similar-but-not-

identical privacy policies. Instead, 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
the 
Internet 
Association 
and 
the 
Information 
Technology 
Industry Council are all pushing 
for voluntary standards, where 
the companies would continue to 
create and enforce their own rules.
In order to ensure the privacy 
rights of all citizens, we should no 
longer accept this monopoly on 
the control of our data. The days 
of blind trust in a self-regulatory 
system for these companies are 
over, and Congress now has an 
opportunity 
to 
draft 
federal 
legislation with teeth to ensure 
the 
proper 
handling 
of 
our 
personal information. Such a law 
would reform the Federal Trade 
Commission, which is the current 
regulatory body tasked with data 
security. Born in an analog era, it 
should be reviewed for its efficacy 
in fighting data breaches in the 
digital age.
In addition, while the GDPR 
is not perfect, representatives 
in Congress should study its 
provisions for consumer-centric 
data policy with a keen eye. The 
GDPR requires organizations to 
demonstrate that they process 
data fairly, openly communicate 
with customers and employees, 
and not keep data for longer than 
required. These are common sense 
regulations that are missing in the 
U.S. on a federal level.
Congress must use the coming 
months to reflect on our national 
data 
security 
policy. 
Privacy 
rights groups in California and 
lawmakers in Brussels have made 
great progress toward a fairer 
alternative to the current situation, 
where the interests of large 
corporations prevail. However, 
there is still a lot of work to be 
done and firms such as Google 
and Facebook will fight for every 
byte of data. I do not attempt to 
demonize these companies for 
doing business. In many ways, 
big tech has improved our lives 
by connecting people around the 
world and serving as humanity’s 
largest 
pool 
of 
knowledge. 
However, their harm to society 
should not go unnoticed.

JOIN OUR EDITORIAL BOARD

Our Editorial Board meets Mondays and Wednesdays 7:15-8:45 PM at 
our newsroom at 420 Maynard Street. All are welcome to come discuss 
national, state and campus affairs.

People of color 
should not 
settle for simply 
having non-white 
representation.


Welcome “bAAck,” welcome 
home, 
welcome 
freshmen, 
welcome all … Welcome Week. 
Nothing screams the start of 
the school year quite like kiddie 
pools filled with sweat and 
beer, freshmen running around 
campus without chaperones for 
the first time in their lives and 
eating and drinking as though 
your body is a garbage disposal. 
Oftentimes I commit myself to 
portraying the world of food 
and wine on this campus as 
sophisticated, graceful and classy. 
And while I will attest to the fact 
that the students on this campus 
effuse elegance in their palettes 
when it comes to good food, that 
the Ann Arbor restaurants are top 
notch and unique and that a vast 
majority of Michigan students 
would 
consider 
themselves 
“foodies,” I cannot sugarcoat the 
one time of year that all of that 
foodie knowledge goes flying 
out the door. That special time 
of the year is Welcome Week. In 
honor of the end of such a sacred, 
foul 
and 
so-forgettable-that-
it’s-memorable week and the 
beginning of Syllabus Week, I have 
compiled the official Welcome 
Week Food and Beverage Pairing 
Recommendations to ensure that 
you celebrated the start of the 
2018–2019 school year with the 
perfect mix of class and utter 
disgrace.
No Thai and Yellow Tail 
Pinot Grigio: It wouldn’t be 
Welcome Week without No Thai, 
which means at least two days 
worth of leftover fried rice for just 
under $10. When splurging on 
your Thai food feast — in between 
forkfuls of oily, glistening pad 
thai noodles spattered with fried 
egg and onion — I recommend a 
nice, chilled glass of Yellow Tail 
Pinot Grigio. The perfect mix 
of elegance and efficiency when 

curing a hangover. Yellow Tail 
also balances and counters the 
potential spice involved in various 
No Thai dishes, making it all the 
more mild and enjoyable.
Pancheros and Mango Four 
Loko: If you’re desperate enough 
to opt for Pancheros vs Chipotle 
or BTB, you’re desperate enough 
to have a casual dinner time 
Floko. The casual Four Loko has 
been opposed and look down 
upon, but truly, if you are on the 
road to sprinting the marathon 
that is Welcome Week, there’s no 
better way to do it then a Floko 
+ Pancheros pairing. I’d opt for 
a chicken quesadilla with a side 
of chips and guac, keep things 
simple and traditional on the food 
end to make way for the real star 
of the show: the beverage. Wait 
until you are truly desperate and 
at your wits end before trying this 
dangerous duo, you may not make 
it to the next darty.
Leftover 
Domino’s 
and 
lukewarm Natty Lite: This 
pairing may sound like your 
worst nightmare. But imagine 
it like this: You stumble out of 
bed at 7:00 a.m. with a blaring 
headache, an unwelcome Svedka 
taste in the back of your mouth 
and the sudden urge to yak. You 
walk into your kitchen for a cup 
of water, but what’s there? Your 
roommate’s half eaten Domino’s 
pizza and a can of not-cold-but-
not-warm Natural Lite beer. You 
reach for the pizza and crack 
open a lukewarm one, not with 
the boys, but simply yourself 
and realize that you were always 
destined to hit this rare form of 
rock bottom. 
Rod’s Diner and Barefoot 
Moscato: How much sugar is 
too much sugar? In the event of 
Welcome Week, there is never 
enough sugar. Dessert wine is 
meant to pair with dessert — and 
that’s why Rod’s thick, creamy, 
blissful colliders pair perfectly 
with the goddess of all sweet 
wine: Barefoot Moscato. You may 

need some water and perhaps a 
pre-pregame nap after this duo 
knocks you out.
Amer’s 
Açaí 
Bowls 
and 
White Claw: The OFFICIAL 
basic Michigan girl Welcome 
Week food and drink pairing is 
an Amer’s açaí bowl topped with 
granola and peanut butter in one 
hand and a can of 100 calorie 
White Claw hard seltzer in the 
other. Due to prime location and 
the menu’s opportune breakfast 
options, this pairing is also a 
definite game day duo, ingested 
by all the girls who occupy the 
hallowed halls of Arbor Blu, 
Landmark and Zaragon. 
Fleetwood 
Diner 
Hippie 
Hash and Smirnoff Ice: When 
going for the quirkiness that is 
Fleetwood Diner, one must always 
expect the element of surprise. 
And what’s more surprising than 
finding a planted Smirnoff Ice 
in your Fleetwood booth upon 
arrival, planted there by only your 
sneakiest friends? After getting 
on one knee and making it onto all 
of your friends’ snapchat stories 
in all your shame and pajamas, 
hippie hash will never feel so 
right, so fulfilling, so greasy and 
so good.
Smoke’s 
Poutinerie 
and 
Kamchatka: Both of these have 
something in common: You don’t 
know how you got there, you 
never intended to get there, you 
promised yourself you wouldn’t 
get there, but alas, there you 
are. Nobody goes out with the 
intention to end up at Beaver 
Trap eating poutine or taking 
pulls of Kamchatka in a sweaty 
basement, but nobody goes into 
this week with the intention of 
meeting many goals either. That’s 
why each bite of cheesy, gravy-
drenched 
poutine 
should 
be 
washed down with a nice big gulp 
of Kamchatka vodka.
Pizza 
House 
Feta 
Bread 
and Franzia: Perhaps the most 
coveted, most important, most 
popular of all food and beverage 

pairings during welcome week, 
the pair who always knows 
five brothers and runs into 24 
people they know in the Diag 
at any moment of the day, is feta 
bread and Franzia. Perhaps it’s 
the alliteration, perhaps it’s the 
tradition, perhaps it’s the so-bad-
it’s-good sentiment running deep 
through both choices — whatever 
it is, these two wrongs certainly 
make a right. Whether you’re 
ordering a late night feta bread 
after going out, cozying up in a 
midday Pizza House booth or 
having a quick pre-nap-and-rally 
snack, nothing pairs better with 
gooey, cheesy feta bread than a 
nice drag of Franzia wine straight 
out of the bag.
Rick’s Mind Probe and 7/11 
taquitos: What’s in a Mind Probe 
and what’s in a taquito from 7/11? 
Many of us don’t know the answer 
to either. On a normal week I’d 
offer the opinion that both are 
horrible choices. But something 
about the dark, dimly lit staircase 
descending into Rick’s juxtaposed 
by the blinding, fluorescent 7/11 
sign 
swinging 
ominously 
on 
South Forest makes me want 
to venture a guess that a Rick’s 
Mind Probe would be missing 
something without the crunch of 
a 7/11 taquito between each sip.
I cannot be disappointed by 
this campus, though it loses its 
foodie attitude for the week 
before school begins. Ann Arbor 
celebrates so many highs in 
the gastronomic field — trendy 
restaurants, tasty new dishes 
and daring chefs — but we must 
remember our late Aug. roots. 
Once classes begin and school 
is in full swing, the Kombucha 
bottles, trendy lattes and ramen 
noodle bowls will be all the 
rage once more. Until next year, 
that is, when we can consult 
this trusty guide for the best 
recommendations of just what 
to pair with that leftover, early 
morning feta bread in order to 
have the best Welcome Week yet.

Eating through Welcome Week

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

It was a Tuesday night, and 
frankly, I wasn’t expecting a 
huge turnout — Grand Rapids 
isn’t the most accessible city 
in Mich., and Tuesdays aren’t 
typically ideal for club shows. 
I showed up early to check out 
the wildly impressive Thin Lips, 
whose new record Chosen Family 
is a testament to the raw talent 
that seems to flow endlessly 
from Philadelphia, which is 
also home to their tourmates 
in Hop Along. After their set, 
which included some back-up 
vocals from Hop Along’s Frances 
Quinlan, I looked around to 
notice the crowd had filled out 
significantly during the opening 
performance, which must have 
been near capacity by that point.
Hop Along is clearly turning 
heads, especially with their 
newest effort Bark Your Head 
Off, Dog, which landed them 
a feature in Rolling Stone 
published the day of the show. 
The album is tight, unpredictable 
and 
thoroughly 
impressive 
from front to back, featuring 
unmatched 
composition 
and 
hairpin changes in tempo and 
atmosphere. 
In 
all 
honesty, 
the album is so ambitious 
and complex I was worried it 
wouldn’t fare nearly as well live. 
My worries were entirely quelled 
by the end of their opening track 
(and new album opener), “How 
Simple.”
Hop Along’s related artists on 
Spotify include Jeff Rosenstock, 
Lemuria and Glocca Morra, who 
all are barely tangential to Hop 
Along in terms of similarity. 
Much like Spotify’s difficulty 
in finding similar artists (likely 
because there aren’t any), I won’t 

pretend to have the vocabulary 
to 
accurately 
describe 
Hop 
Along’s 
musicianship. 
Even 
within the confines of a live 
setting, their art is absolutely 
stunning; 
Quinlan’s 
vocals 
range from desperate yells to 
soft musings, best exemplified 
during “Not Abel,” a sprawling, 
biblically-charged 
track 
split 
into two distinct sections that 
the band navigated gracefully 
through its entire duration. 
The band’s greatest strength is 
inarguably the quality of each 
individual who brings these 
songs to life. Every instrument 
holds a significant weight in 
every song — not a single note 
goes to waste.
And to add to their impressive 
skill, the band was more than 
happy to banter with the crowd, 
lightening 
the 
mood 
while 
showing their own comfort 
and 
ease 
on 
stage. 
Quips 
from Quinlan included “You 
already paid your money, I hate 
Metallica!” and “Keep your shirt 
on, Jim!” referencing the boho 
aesthetic of Jim Morrison.
While touring in support of 
their newest album, Hop Along 
still included tracks from their 
previous 
records, 
rounding 
out a 14-track setlist that truly 
reflected 
the 
diversity 
and 
growth in their songwriting. Fan 
favorites included wonderful 
and poppy songs like “Tibetan 
Pop Stars” and “The Knock,” 
while deep cuts “Kids on the 
Boardwalk” and “Texas Funeral” 
were resounded back by the 
long time fans in the audience. 
When words seem to fail, Hop 
Along does the heavylifting with 
their songwriting, finding ways 
to convey feeling in their little 
narratives carried over fusions 
of pop, rock, indie and the 
occasional dash of folk.

Hop Along is 
turning heads

“Slender Man” is a horror 
movie released in 2018 based 
on the popular “creepypasta” 
that debuted in 2009. It is 
approximately 93 minutes long. 
It 
costars 
Joey 
King 
(“The 
Kissing Booth”). I can tell you all 
of this because the information 
is available on the Internet, yet 
despite having just seen the movie 
earlier today, I’m having trouble 
remembering a single thing that 
actually happens over its runtime. 
I’ve gone into a dissociative state 
once in my life, and honestly, this 
doesn’t feel dissimilar to that.
It’s not just that “Slender Man” 
fails at the things we expect from 
a horror movie or a movie in 
general, it’s that those things are 
completely absent. There’s no plot 
or story, there’s just one sequence 
of scares stuck to another with 
duct tape and spit. Four girls 
decide to summon “Slender Man,” 
as young girls in 2018 are wont 
to do. Uh oh, Slender Man shows 
up and does some ill-defined evil 
mumbo-jumbo with no apparent 
end goal. Then the movie ends. 

Over the 93 minutes, nothing 
anybody does makes any sense. 
The girls all just sort of accept at a 
certain point that Slender Man is 
haunting them and wait to die, and 
that’s the movie. They don’t fight 
back, because that would mean the 
writers would have to make them 

active, interesting characters, and 
who wants that?
For all the sins of the “story,” the 
characters fare somehow worse. 
None of the girls go through a 
change beyond moving from 
“not haunted” to “haunted,” but 
more than that, nobody is given 
a character to begin with. From 
beginning to end, they’re just 
featureless mannequins meant 
to carry us to the next hackneyed 
scare. Of the four girls that we 
begin the movie with, one of them 
disappears almost immediately, 
and 
another 
is 
seemingly 

forgotten by the script. The last 
two are saddled with two of the 
most laughable fates in recent 
horror history in a sequence that 
prompted one of the high-school 
aged “Slender” fans in front of 
me to stand up and declare to the 
theater and his friends, “Fuck it. 
I’m out.”
What horror there is can easily 
be divided into three camps: the 
classic jump scare, the creepy 
imagery without rhyme or reason 
and the stupid. If you’re not a fan 
of loud noises trying to tell you 
when to be scared, just wait and 
there will be a scene where a girl 
dreams she gives birth to Slender 
Man or where Slender Man uses 
FaceTime, both of which are things 
that actually happen. Perhaps the 
best thing that can be said about 
“Slender Man” is that there’s a 
variety of bad horror instead of 
just one kind. Cinematographer 
Luca del Puppo (“Mercy”) shoots 
it all in the most monotonous, 
ugly low light possible — the kind 
of darkness that will have you 
pleading for someone, anyone 
to turn on a damn light — but 
the movie is unpredictable in its 
awfulness nonetheless.
Perhaps most disappointingly, 

‘Slender Man’ falls short

FILM REVIEW

Mac 
Miller 
returned 
on 
Aug. 3rd with his fifth studio 
album, Swimming, in the wake 
of his heavily media-scrutinized 
breakup with Ariana Grande. 
Given that breakup and his recent 
DUI, expectations were that this 
album would be a depressed and 
chaotic work in the vein of his 
2014 mixtape Faces — however, 
what we’ve received instead is a 
phlegmatic piece of protracted 
contemplation, more thoughtful 
than despondent.
Swimming 
feels 
like 
the 
companion piece to his most recent 
album The Divine Feminine, a 
continuation of the jazz-influenced 
sound but with a polar opposite 
thematic message. The Divine 
Feminine was a record of love and 
optimism; Swimming is lonesome 
(but not lonely) and reflective — a 
world-weary expression of self-
acceptance. For better or for worse, 
the album tends to blur together 
due to instrumental sameness. 
Some would call this cohesiveness, 
some would call it a lack of variety; 
lean toward the latter. The addition 
of “Programs” could have lessened 
this sense of repetition, different 
enough to provide a change of 
pace but similar enough to not be a 
jarring inclusion. 
It wasn’t much of a challenge 

to improve upon the lyricism 
of The Divine Feminine, which 
was a concept album about Mac 
eating out his girlfriend. To be 
fair, if I were having sex with 
Ariana Grande, I’d probably never 
stop bragging about it either. He 

managed to step it up on Swimming, 
and now that the two are no longer 
together, Mac is forced to explore 
themes more varied than Ariana 
Grande’s vagina, including issues 
such as isolation, helplessness 
and the long-term impact of fame. 
However, despite discussing more 
serious topics, the album never 
sinks into darkness or pessimism. 
“It ain’t perfect but I don’t mind” 
Mac 
sighs/moans/sings 
on 
“Perfecto,” a line which sums up 
his overarching philosophy on 
Swimming pretty well: The way 
to deal with life’s problems is to go 
with the flow, the lyrical equivalent 
of shrugging one’s shoulders.
The standouts on the album are 
“Self-Care,” “Ladders,” “What’s 
the Use?” and “2009.” “Self-Care” 
is full of airy ambience and a well-
executed beat switch. “Ladders” 
and “What’s the Use?” are bouncy 
funk jams that are solidly in the 
pocket, 
and 
“2009” 
contains 
beautiful orchestration (courtesy 

of Jon Brion) as well as some of 
Mac’s more thoughtful lyrics as he 
reflects on his past. 
One of the weaker cuts is 
“Conversation Pt. 1,” a worse 
version of “I Am Who I Am (Killing 
Time),” the vocals and instrumental 
both dreadfully boring (surprising, 
given that Flying Lotus is credited 
with production on the track). The 
only moment of dynamism on the 
track is a lame trumpet part tacked 
on the end that sounds like a Miles 
Davis impersonator on a high dose 
of lithium. 
Given both how long Mac 
has been around and how many 
projects he has released, it’s hard 
to believe that he’s only 26 years 
old (younger than Kanye West 
was when he released The College 
Dropout!). In spite of his young age, 
Swimming feels like the reflective 
conclusion to a lengthy career. 
Because Mac started so young, 
his late-game coincides with an 
age at which he begins to ripen on 
the vine (in direct contrast with 
Kanye, whose denouncement thus 
far has consisted of becoming 
a sundowning Boomer whose 
Twitter is one step removed from 
shit like “live, laugh, love” and 
Minion memes). While Swimming 
isn’t a perfect record, and will likely 
be considered inconsequential in 
relation to Mac’s other post-Blue 
Slide Park discography, it’s a good, 
if not incredible, album with some 
standout cuts.

MUSIC REVIEW

there was a scenario where 
“Slender 
Man” 
actually 
had 
a purpose. Since its creation, 
Slender 
Man 
has 
become 
something of a dark mascot for 
lonely young people, climaxing 
in 2014 when two young girls 
stabbed their friend 19 times in 
order to become servants of the 
creature, as chronicled in HBO’s 
2017 
documentary 
“Beware 
the Slenderman.” There was an 
opportunity for this interpretation 

of the “Slender Man” mythos to 
engage with the same topics that 
doc covered — loneliness and how 
the internet can be used to spread 
a story — but from a different 
perspective. While there are brief, 
brief moments where these things 
are touched upon, they play almost 
no part in the story at large and no 
statement is made; it’s as pointless 
as anything else.
With a movie lacking completely 
in story, character development, 

horror and purpose, what is there 
to bring audiences to the theater? 
There’s 
some 
unintentional 
comedy to be sure — there’s a 
supposedly “scary” moment so 
soul-crushingly stupid that it sent 
the entire theater into hysterics — 
but more than anything, “Slender 
Man” is just dull. It’s an absolute 
chore to sit through in a way few 
movies are, and each successive 
scene of nothing happening just 
makes it worse.

8A — Tuesday, September 4, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The most impressive music 
careers are those that convey an 
evolution in a creative sense: The 
Beatles and their growth from 
Please, Please Me to Sergeant 

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, 
Kanye West and his growth from 
The College Dropout to Yeezus. 
Ideally, a musician’s respective 
genre should follow their creative 
advances, making for a fascinating 
display of an artist’s capability to 
mold peers and followers and to 
guide an entire genre toward a 
more creatively inspired realm. 
Similar to The Beatles’ impact on 
rock and Kanye’s impact on hip 
hop, Young Thug has been on his 
way to trap immortality as his 
artistry has evolved and the genre 
has responded with appeal. 
From his debut on Rich Gang’s 
2014 single, “Lifestyle,” that had 
listeners marveling at the warbling 
vocal style that would become 
Thug’s most iconic trait, to the 
lavender dress worn on the cover 
of 2016’s JEFFERY, Thug has 
planted himself at the vanguard 
of trap music, constantly breaking 
conventions to advance the genre 
from generally nonmusical and 
hypermasculine 
to 
beautifully 
melodic 
and 
accepting 
of 
femininity. His discography is 
covered in hard trap, groovy 
funk and homey country, and has 
become increasingly complex with 
each release (he has even received 
nods from Kanye and Elton John 
for his originality and capacity to 
push hip hop’s envelope.)
That these trendsetting and 
creative characteristics are so 
ingrained in Thug’s artistry makes 

his most recent release, Slime 
Language, a bit of a head-scratcher. 
The mixtape is bogged down by 
unoriginal 
features, 
outdated 
beats and a lack of thematic focus. 
Even its cover, with green and red 
slime oozing over hands miming 
the words “Young Stoner Life” in 
sign language, is confusing and 
uninspiring. 
Slime Language’s first knock is 
its features. In such a collaborative 
era in hip hop, it’s never a surprise 
to find a few featured artists on 
an album. In fact, it’s actually 
quite rare to come across a 
featureless project (see: J. Cole’s 
“platinum 
with 
no 
features” 
trend). Oftentimes, collaborating 
with other artists on a track 
allows a rapper to pool various 
fan bases and create a super-team 
effect. Because hip hop is such a 
personality-driven 
genre, 
each 
star has a unique voice and style, 
so listeners find a little extra 
excitement in hearing how their 
favorite personalities tackle a track 
together. The formula is typically 
fun and successful, but only when 
the personalities merged on a track 
each provide something different 
and impressive; on Slime, this 
almost never happens. Thirteen 
of the tape’s 15 tracks feature an 
artist other than Young Thug. 
What’s more, nearly every featured 
artist seems to be doing their 
best Thug impression, sounding 
indistinguishable from him and 
the other featured artists and 
accordingly eliminating the multi-
personality benefit of features. 
Additionally, for an artist who 
is perhaps most known for his 
catchy hooks, Thug outsources 
the choruses of his Slime tracks 
to other artists too often, leaving 
listeners craving more of his 
anthemic vocal acrobatics. 
Slime also falls short in the 
music department. Nearly every 
track has a beat loop with loud 
808 bass tied to each kick drum, a 
template popularized by producer 
Metro Boomin in trap’s early days, 

but one that more complex and 
musical methods of production 
have left in the dust. Ironically, 
Thug was one of the artists to 
transcend this simple template, 
incorporating elements of funk 
into JEFFERY and elements of 
country into Beautiful Thugger 
Girls. With Slime, though, the 
beats seem to have slipped back 
into 2015, a concern especially 
noticeable in the wake of Travis 
Scott’s ASTROWORLD, a project 
that raised the bar for trap’s 
musical standard just a few weeks 
prior. (Perhaps Thug could benefit 
from Scott’s eclectic production 
process.)
While the actual content of the 
project is nothing special, Thug did 
manage to bring progress in one 
regard: women. Trap has always 
been and still is a genre dominated 
by men, often braggadociously 
rapping about how they mistreat 
women. Thus, female features 
are almost unheard of. On Slime, 
however, three tracks feature 
female artists, and not in the 
conventional way with sung hooks 
in a pretty voice to counterbalance 
the masculinity of the verses; these 
female rappers have full verses 
and rap about fucking shit up 
and making money behind heavy 
autotune. So, even with a sonically 
lackluster project, Thug continues 
to make some waves. 
Realistically, 
the 
mixtape 
does have a handful of bangers. 
Just because it sounds outdated 
and simple doesn’t mean it won’t 
augment your party playlists; 
“Audemar,” “Chanel (Go Get It)” 
and “Scoliosis” are highlights 
that provide the raw vocals and 
hype-inducing flow that Thug fans 
crave. Still, in the broader lens of 
music as something that breathes 
and grows with time, it seems 
like the rest of the trap world has 
finally caught up with Young Thug, 
leaving Slime Language stale and 
unoriginal. We’ll just have to wait 
for the next slimey project to see if 
Thugger can still turn heads.

MUSIC REVIEW

What 
happens 
when 
you 
combine all the underutilized token 
Asians from sitcom television into 
one movie? Pure comedy gold. 
From established actors like 

Ken 
Jeong 
(“Community”) 
and Michelle Yeoh (“Star Trek: 
Discovery”) to the up-and-coming 
Awkwafina 
(“Ocean’s 
8”) 
to 
misused supporting characters like 
Ronny Chieng (“The Daily Show”) 
and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon 
Valley”) to the face of a new era of 
Asian-American representation on 
television, Constance Wu (“Fresh 
Off the Boat”) — “Crazy Rich 
Asians” has them all.
The movie, based on the 2013 
book trilogy by Kevin Kwan, 
follows Rachel Chu (Wu) as she 
accompanies her boyfriend Nick 
Young (Henry Golding, “A Simple 
Favor”) to his home country of 
Singapore. She soon realizes Nick 
is not your average New Yorker, 
but the heir-apparent to one of the 

richest real estate families in Asia. 
Traditional and modern values 
clash as Rachel, an ABC (American-
born-Chinese), tries to fit in with 
Nick’s family — particularly his 
intimidating 
mother, 
Eleanor 
(Yeoh).
At this point in Hollywood 
representation, the main focus still 
lies on undermining stereotypes, 
rather than making race secondary 
to the characters themselves. In 
an ideal world, an Asian character 
would just be a character, free of 
the burden to hold up a positive, 
progressive image of their race.
Promoting 
diversity 
as 
the 
selling point of a movie returns the 
target audience to white people or, 
in the case of “Crazy Rich Asians,” 
all non-Asian demographics. 
While non-Asians or non-Asian-
Americans might view some of 
the caricatured supporting cast 
in the Kevin Kwan adaptation as 
defying stereotypes, this is not 
quite the case. Instead, the film 
mines deeper caves for stereotypes, 
some recognizable only to those 
who have been immersed in Asian 
culture and heritage. 
Of course, stereotypes are a 
trademark necessity of filling out 
the cast of a romantic comedy, 
where screentime for sidekicks 
are minimal and, as a result, 
characterization 
as 
well. 
The 

flaws of “Crazy Rich Asians” has 
everything to do with the rom-com 
format itself and not the fact that 
Asians helm every aspect of the 
film. 
There’s the predictable plot, 
outlandish 
romantic 
gestures, 
refusal to engage in serious politics, 
but also the impressive aspects of 
rom-coms: Gatsby-esque set design, 
believable chemistry between the 
leads and zingy one-liners.
“Crazy Rich Asians” feels at 
times like an opportunity for non-
Asians to venture into an “exotic” 
world Hollywood has ignored 
since its beginnings. However, the 
all-Asian cast in a blockbuster film 
made buying a ticket to this film 
still incredibly emotional. 
Reviewers 
(percentage-wise 
mostly 
non-Asian) 
walked 
on 
eggshells around this film, refusing 
to strike down the issues with 
rom-coms in fear of undermining 
the importance of this turn in 
representation. 
For people looking for a solid 
rom-com, “Crazy Rich Asians” 
delivers, 
not 
buckling 
under 
the pressure of a history of 
underrepresentation. 
However, 
in terms of the quality of the film 
itself, “Crazy Rich Asians” is just 
another rom-com, though that may 
be its greatest accomplishment to 
on the road to equality.

Michigan in Color

The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
These are my words. Sound nice 
don’t they? Sound... empowering?
Or maybe it sounds like the 
faux deep mantra of a girl who’s 
trying to convince herself that 
she’s a good social justice activist.
It may sound like beautiful 
words that give an accurate 
reflection of what it means to be 
a woman of color, but to me...it 
sounds like an excuse.
It was my excuse when my 
parents commented on how I 
was leaving a STEM field when 
I switched majors, a field that 
is historically unkind to people 
who aren’t male or white. In 
retaliation, 
I 
showed 
them 
statistics about the number of 
non-white 
female 
producers 
in television and film. Shonda 
Rhimes and Mindy Kaling are 
big names, but they are still only 
two names I said. I’d be helping to 
pioneer a path for other girls if I 
pursued my Comm Studies major, 
I said.
It still didn’t stop me from 
feeling like a hypocrite after all 
the impassioned speeches I’d 
given about women in STEM.
The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
It sounds like a way to allow 
all women of color to participate 

in social justice without some of 
the pitfalls of the “Social Justice” 
community, but to me...it sounds 
like an excuse.
It was my excuse whenever 
someone asked why I wasn’t 
attending a protest or signing a 
petition. I’d explain how there 
are many different forms of 
activism, and that I participated 
in what I could when I could. 
I’d explain how I wasn’t really a 
‘slacktivist’ because I was doing 
the little things in my day to day 
life like instigating dialogues 
with people who are unaware 
of their privilege. Or engaging 
in conversations with my white 
male housemates about issues 
women of color face.
It still didn’t stop me from 
feeling like a fraud every time I 
was too burnt out to educate and 
advocate.
The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
It sounds like a lovely way to 
support women of color with 
whatever they choose to do but to 
me...it sounds like an excuse.
It was my excuse whenever 
a friend asked why I engaged 
with 
anything 
problematic. 
The Marvel movies don’t have 
great representation but Tess 
Thompson just showed up in 
Thor 3, I’d claim. My favorite 
kpop group getting international 
fame is breaking cultural barriers 
despite the occasional cultural 
appropriation, I’d insist. Wearing 

makeup isn’t for anyone else, 
but for me, I’d cry. If I can only 
participate in things that are 
ethical and moral and just, then I 
won’t get to enjoy anything at all, 
I’d argue.
It didn’t stop me from feeling 
like a liar any time I’d get called 
out for my interests and hobbies
But as much as I may feel 
like a hypocrite, a fraud, a liar, I 
resist white supremacy and the 
patriarchy by choosing to exist 
and learn and grow and thrive.
The problem with the existence 
of a woman of color being an act 
of resistance is that it is my very 
existence that is questioned and 
policed and entirely undermined. 
My existence does not only reflect 
my own self but is then forced to 
reflect anyone who looks remotely 
like me. I am not allowed to simply 
exist, but I do anyway. I take up 
space, physical and vocal. I smile 
when I am happy, cry when I’m 
sad, rant when I’m angry, eat 
when I’m hungry and rest when 
I’m tired. I support other women 
of color. I try to be a good ally and 
a better activist.
The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
It’s not an excuse - it’s my battle 
chant.
Because I resist to exist.
Because I exist and I have no 
choice but to resist.
Because I am a woman of color.
I exist. 
I resist.

YKB 2018: Not cleared for landing

I like to think I’m a sexy 
woman. In fact, I know I’m a 
sexy woman. But, the problem is 
sex stresses me out. Not the stuff 
leading up to it. Not the hot make 
outs or the slow stripping. Just 
the bit where every bit of clothing 
is off and things are about to 
inserted in places and honestly 
it’s almost more stressful than 
midterm week. Almost.
Because 
the 
thing 
is, 
sexiness takes effort. Aside 
from the usual routines of 
makeup and well fit outfits, I 
have to go the extra mile. I’ve 
inherited gorgeous brown skin 
and beautiful black hair....that 
grows everywhere. Becoming 
sexy requires shaving my legs, 
using nair for my arms if the 
occasion is important enough, 
waxing off sideburns and upper 
lip hair and cheek hair and chin 
hair and of course, getting my 
eyebrows threaded. But then 
there’s that final, final step that 
terrifies me: nether region hair 
removal.

So the science says that 
you really shouldn’t remove 
your pubic hair – it’s there for 
a reason. But for a girl who’s 
heard so much shit about the 
hair that grows everywhere 
else...hair down there seems 
like an invitation for mockery. 
I mean, I’ve had a girl howl at 
me in the hallways at school, 
call me a werewolf because of 
the hair on my arms. Another 
boy made a comment about me 
having a mustache and I don’t 
think I’ll ever forget the sudden 
deep shame I felt. The shame I 
still manage to feel. I’m more 
ashamed of my body hair than I 
could ever be about sex.
But anyway, the point is, my 
yoni just seems like another 
body part on a list of body parts 
that has more hair than it needs. 
I mean so far I haven’t had any 
complaints about it but I always 
feel the need to warn anyone who 
ventures down there. It’s a bush, 
a forest, don’t get lost, keep your 
arms and legs in the vehicle at 
all times thank you, and now if 
we look a bit further south you 
can see the oasis you’ve been 
searching for. Whoa there, not 

that far south.
And, it’s not like I haven’t 
considered my options --- waxing 
is painful as fuck. Like, literally 
spreading hot wax around my 
vulva then using it to rip out 
hair by the follicles just so I feel 
comfortable enough for sex? 
In my opinion, the cost benefit 
analysis doesn’t work out, despite 
my mother’s teachings of “no 
pain, no gain.” Using a sharp 
blade down there doesn’t sound 
any better, not to mention the 
fact that my hair grows fast and 
I’d rather not give anyone carpet 
burn.
Yes, I can trim things but it 
doesn’t achieve the same effect of 
smooth hairlessness; I imagine it 
would feel much like the silkiness 
of my legs when I finally find a 
reason to shave in the winter. 
Or maybe it’ll just reveal more 
imperfections, like the breakouts 
and pores I find after removing 
the hair on my face. It seems I’ll 
never learn what it’s like to have 
a hairless pussy.
I suppose I’m just stuck for 
now.
A sex-stressed sexy woman.
Say that five times fast.

Like another road loss to a ranked 
team, the sight of a Michigan 
quarterback running for dear life 
is nothing new. Last year, it led to 
injuries for Wilton Speight and 
Brandon Peters. It nearly did the 
same to Shea Patterson on Saturday, 
as the junior quarterback missed 
parts of the fourth quarter with 
cramps after being pressured all 
night.
Officially, Patterson was sacked 
three times and hurried on another 
six occasions. In reality, though, it 
was much worse.
The Wolverines’ offensive tackles 
looked almost helpless. Patterson 
rarely received a clean pocket to 
throw from — pressure from the 
edge or Notre Dame stunts came 
almost instantaneously. It showed 
in Michigan’s offense: quick throws 
were its only reliable way of moving 
the ball, and the Wolverines had just 
three plays of 15 yards or more with 
one offensive touchdown. 
But 
during 
Monday’s 
press 
conferences, coach Jim Harbaugh 
said he wasn’t concerned — and 
rather encouraged — by his offensive 
line’s performance.
“I thought it was improved,” 
Harbaugh said. “We look at it and 
there was quite a few boxes that 
were checked (as) this is improved. 
We’ll continue to get better, but it 
was one of the areas I think we’re 
improving in.”
Michigan started Jon Runyan Jr. 

and Juwann Bushell-Beatty at tackle, 
along with Ben Bredeson, Cesar Ruiz 
and Michael Onwenu — left to right 
— on the interior Saturday. Despite 
a plethora of glaring mistakes and 
the presence of reserves like redshirt 
freshman tackle James Hudson 
and junior guard Stephen Spanellis, 
Harbaugh said he’ll stick with the 
same group next week against 
Western Michigan.
“I think the way we played this 
week is the way we’ll play the next 
game with the offensive line,” 
Harbaugh said.
Junior tight end Sean McKeon 
and sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins echoed similar positive 
sentiments about the group, noting 
that fall camp isn’t the same animal 
as the Fighting Irish’s elite front 
seven.
“I thought (the line) looked good,” 
McKeon said. “The offensive line, 
obviously, they gotta work to build 
chemistry maybe even more than 
they tried to build in camp. So just 
got to build more chemistry up 
front.”
Added Collins: “(It’s a) great 
o-line. I feel like the criticism they 
(get) shouldn’t be talked about 
because I know how hard they 
work.”
Harbaugh 
and 
his 
players’ 
comments heavily contrast what’s 
being said outside Schembechler 
Hall. 
Fans, 
understandably 
frustrated by Michigan’s fourth-
straight loss dating back to last 
season, were quick to scapegoat the 
offensive line for Saturday’s results.

And while there were other 
issues — defensive penalties and 
the spectacular play of Notre Dame 
quarterback 
Brandon 
Wimbush 
— the offensive line was the most 
detrimental by far. It cost the 
Wolverines the ball or points on four 
separate occasions.
In the first quarter, Patterson took 
a 17-yard sack that pushed Michigan 
out of redshirt sophomore kicker 
Quinn Nordin’s range. Later, on 
second-and-goal at the two, Notre 
Dame got to Patterson again, forcing 
the Wolverines to settle for a field 
goal. The Fighting Irish’s pressure 
was also pivotal to Patterson’s 
interception and fumble — though 
both were partially avoidable.
Despite those plays, however, 
Harbaugh was encouraged by his 
quarterback’s performance.
“The thing that stood out the 
most was his accuracy, location of 
the balls,” Harbaugh said. “He was 
accurate all game. 
… 
First time in a 
game 

situation, 
I thought he 
ran (the offense) 
extremely well.”
That’s 
precisely 
why Michigan’s offensive 
line play is so frustrating for fans. 
For all the flashes Patterson showed 

Saturday, he won’t realize his 
potential if a defensive lineman 
is constantly in his facemask 
two seconds after the snap. And 
it certainly won’t be realized if 
Patterson’s hurt.
Harbaugh said his line has 
“improved”, and to be fair, that’s a 
relative word. He could genuinely 
feel like it has taken a step up from 
last year.
But it wasn’t good enough 
Saturday. Not even close.
Michigan’s offensive 
line has a long way to 
go. And no amount 
of 
Harbaugh 
and his players 
singing kumbaya 
changes that.

Saying or Doing?
 
Michigan has talked about 
its positives from Saturday’s 
game, but the product on the 
field wasn’t so sterling.

LINE OF INQUIRY

MICHIGAN 17
NOTRE DAME 24

MARK CALCAGNO
Daily Sports Editor

A week ago, sophomore center Cesar 

Ruiz stood in front of reporters and made 

a proclamation.

“Our offensive line will be the one 

strength of our offense this year,” Ruiz 

said. When pressed with a follow-up, he 

doubled down.

“You’ll see.”

Saturday night, in Michigan’s 24-17 

season-opening loss to Notre Dame, 

anyone with two eyes and a television 

set saw plenty. They saw a quarterback 

constantly needing to evade oncoming 

rushers. They saw a normally potent 

rushing attack held to 58 yards on 33 

carries. They saw a group incessantly 

blown around like a tin roof in a 

hurricane.

For months, anyone who walked 

through 
Schembechler 
Hall 
was 

inundated with buzz about a new 

offensive line. Simplication from new 

offensive line coach Ed Warriner, they 

were told, was going to cure all ills from 

a group that finished 117th in adjusted 

sack rate.

So much for that.

“They brought a lot of blitzes at first,” 

reasoned junior running back Karan 

Higdon, “brought more guys than we 

can block.”

The 
statement 
— 
while 

mathematically true — belies the scarred, 

fatal flaw plaguing this program. The 

Wolverines’ offensive line is a problem 

that has no answer.

It will hold back an offense that is 

otherwise filled with playmakers. It will 

force schematic changes that mask its 

weakness. It could get its quarterback 

— who showed flashes of brilliance — 

injured. 

With Michigan in opposing territory 

at the end of the third quarter, hoping to 

close a double-digit gap, Notre Dame got 

a free rusher to junior quarterback Shea 

Patterson’s blindside. Patterson showed 

his elusiveness, evading a crunching hit, 

and scrambling for nine yards. 

One play later, the Fighting Irish ran a 

simple stunt, freeing a defensive lineman 

past Ruiz, and barreling through Higdon. 

Forced to release the ball early, Patterson 

heaved up a prayer as he was hit. Notre 

Dame defensive lineman Julian Okwara 

was waiting for the easy interception.

As he learned quickly, evade the 

swarming rush on one play, it’ll just be 

back the next.

“They got us on that one inside blitz 

that we didn’t pick up,” said Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh. “It was a good 

impression that their front was bringing 

the entire night. Some we blocked, yeah. 

Could we be better? Yes. We’ll work to 

improve.”

Added fifth-year senior defensive 

lineman Chase Winovich, when asked 

about the struggling unit: “I know 

they’re working hard. Just like myself 

and everybody else on this team, we’ve 

got corrections to be made. They’re a 

well-coached group of individuals and 

they’re going to be sure to leave those 

corrections moving forward.”

On this night in South Bend, the 

offensive line was far from the only 

reason for the loss. The defense over-

pursued on nearly every play in the first 

half, and paid dearly for it. Penalties 

mounted up — on both sides of the ball — 

to derail any semblance of momentum. 

At times, the offensive scheme looked 

familiarly bland. Notre Dame executed 

its game plan to perfection, pushing 

around the interior of Michigan’s defense 

like rag dolls.

There is reason to believe this team 

can mend those issues as the season 

progresses. There is no such reason to 

believe the offensive line will do the 

same.

Redshirt freshman James Hudson 

will undoubtedly see time as early as 

next week at one of the tackle spots, if for 

no other reason than there’s nothing to 

lose. Coaches and players have been sure 

to commend his talent during spring, 

with the competition for a starting spot 

coming down to the wire. He has the 

frame and athleticism. 

Freshman Jalen Mayfield might also 

get a shot, under the same whimsical 

rationale. He’s drawn rave reviews from 

the coaching staff and players.

But Harbaugh, Warriner and the 

rest of the coaching staff spent weeks 

of spring practice, offseason workouts 

and then fall practice, only to conclude 

MAX MARCOVITCH
Daily Sports Editor

that these were the five best offensive 

linemen to combat a formative Notre 

Dame front seven. To expect Hudson, 

Mayfield or any replacement to be a 

magic elixir would exceed naivety. 

Help will come the next couple 

weeks in the form of Western Michigan 

and SMU. Neither foe will offer 

Michigan anything resembling Notre 

Dame’s talented front seven. It could 

be a time to grow. It will certainly be a 

chance to see what the younger options 

have to offer.

“It’s the beginning,” Harbaugh said, 

when asked about his level of concern 

with the offense. “It’s the beginning for 

us. We’re not treating it like the end.”

But Saturday was a chance to back 

up the talk against a real opponent in a 

real environment against a real defense. 

Fans waited to see what Ruiz and the 

offensive line had in store. Saturday 

night, they got their fill. What they saw, 

though, was just more of the same.

The offensive line is not a strength, 

at least not yet. It is the common 

denominator luring an offense back into 

the familiar confines of mediocrity.

Far from promised improvement, o-line shows more of the same

Harbaugh, players defend offensive line

SportsTuesday: Saying or doing?
T

he fourth season of Jim 
Harbaugh’s tenure in 

Ann Arbor is 
off to a rocky 
start after a 
loss to Notre 
Dame.
Since, 
some 
unflattering 
stats have 
been 
advertised, 
like how the 
Wolverines are 9-9 in their last 
18 games and how they haven’t 
won a road game against a 
ranked opponent since 2006.
But fear not, Michigan fans, 
because there may be room for 
optimism.
On Monday afternoon, from 
defensive end Rashan Gary 
to VIPER Khaleke Hudson to 
tight end Sean McKeon to wide 
receiver Nico Collins, and even 
up to coach Jim Harbaugh, 
nothing but positives were 
pointed out. It was all eyes 
forward and downplaying the 
flaws that made the Wolverines 
0-1. 
“I think everybody inside 
of our team believes in each 
other and believes in the 
team, believes in each other,” 
Harbaugh said. “And stressing 
the importance of going from 
one week, to Week 1 to Week 
2, never more important than 
with this ballclub. So looking 
to make all the strides you can 
in this one week, and focusing 
on that. We’re focusing on this 
game, never a more important 
game than the one we’ll go 
down the tunnel to play this 
week.”
I know what you’re thinking: 
Mike, of course they pointed 
out positives, what else are they 
gonna say?
But just for kicks, let’s break 
down some of these positives.
First, there was the offensive 
line.
I thought I saw junior 

quarterback Shea Patterson 
and redshirt sophomore Dylan 
McCaffrey running for their 
lives, and Michigan’s rushing 
attack limited to just 58 yards 
on Saturday.
On Monday afternoon, 
though, Harbaugh said he 
thought the unit was much 
improved. Monday night, 
during the Inside Michigan 
Football Radio Show, Higdon 
went as far as to say that 
the offensive line is easy to 
criticize live, but that when you 
break down the film, they did 
some nice things — though he 
conceded that Notre Dame’s 
defensive line was better.
I will preface this by saying 
that I do not know even half as 
much about football as Higdon, 
or really anybody on the team. 
Also, I do not have all the angles 
and film breakdown capabilities 

that the Wolverines surely have.
But I did re-watch the game, 
and what I saw was Patterson 
and McCaffrey running for 
their lives for most of the game 
and Michigan’s rushing attack 
limited to just 58 yards. 
I would be curious to see 
what redshirt freshman tackle 
James Hudson could bring 
to the table, but Harbaugh 
was asked about that sort of a 
personnel change on Monday.
“I think the way we played 
this week is the way we’ll 
play the next game with the 
offensive line,” Harbaugh said, 
though I don’t think he would 
tell us if he was changing 
personnel.
Okay, let’s not dawdle on one 
aspect.
Another focus of Michigan’s 
shortcomings was its defense, 
which was exposed in the first 

half and put the Wolverines in 
a hole from which they couldn’t 
escape.
To that, Gary and Hudson 
had some answers.
“Not at all,” Gary said when 
asked if he could pinpoint the 
defense’s problems in the first 
half. “The only thing I can 
really say is we hurt ourselves. 
You know, only two, three 
plays, maybe four plays, can 
hurt you at the end of the game. 
That’s really what it came down 
to, and that’s just us hurting 
ourselves.”
Added Hudson: “Just self-
inflicted wounds was the 
reason why we lost. Just third 
down penalties and doing some 
of the stuff we normally do 
right.”
They are right on this one, as 
the second half was a showcase 
of just how dominant the 

defense can be. But the reasons 
for the shortcomings in the first 
half are a bit troubling.
Often times, Fighting Irish 
quarterback Brandon Wimbush 
and the offense took advantage 
of over-aggressiveness from 
Michigan’s defense. That 
showed in the untimely 
penalties the Wolverines 
incurred just as much as the 
quarterback runs and screen 
passes that were successful.
Of course, the other side of 
that coin is that Michigan is led 
by its fast and tough defense. 
And it’s also a program that has 
struggled to contain running 
quarterbacks for… ever?
Luckily there aren’t any 
other running quarterbacks on 
the schedule other than Ohio 
State’s Dwayne Haskins and 
Penn State’s Trace McSorley 
and Michigan State’s Brian 

Lewerke and Nebraska’s Adrian 
Martinez and Maryland’s 
Tyrrell Pigrome and Indiana’s 
Peyton Ramsey.
Okay, I’ll just hit on one more 
quote.
Sophomore wide receiver 
Nico Collins said the offensive 
gameplan was not the problem 
and that it doesn’t need to 
change moving forward.
The Wolverines failed to 
capitalize on opportunities 
all night long offensively, 
and, partially because of the 
offensive line, couldn’t come up 
with the explosive plays that 
some expected.
When the defense finally 
locked down in the second half, 
Patterson and company couldn’t 
figure out a way to climb back 
into the game all the way.
It feels like at least 
something could be done to 
help that. Maybe a new transfer 
quarterback? Maybe a new 
offensive line coach? Maybe 
two former NFL coaches calling 
the offensive shots?
I know, I’m getting greedy.
Now none of this is to say 
that Michigan can’t turn things 
around. It is still a roster loaded 
with talent, with a coach who 
has been to the Super Bowl in 
this decade.
But something has to change, 
no matter what the Wolverines 
say. The offensive line must 
improve, with personnel 
changes or without them. The 
defense has to be solid, and 
especially against dual-threat 
signal callers. The offense must 
get big plays, whether it’s with 
a better gameplan or better 
execution.
The stats are ugly for a 
reason. Michigan is saying the 
right things to avoid a mutiny, 
but there is no need for a 
mutiny if the ship sinks first.

Michigan falls short in season opener against Notre Dame, 24-17

SOUTH 
BEND, 
Ind. 
— 
After all the hype for Shea 
Patterson, the talk of returning 
starters, the assurances that 
the offensive line had improved 
and the general hype for the 
2018 Michigan football team, 
the Wolverines finally had their 
chance to prove that it wasn’t 
just hype on Saturday night 
against Notre Dame.
But in less than eight minutes, 
all of those hopes began to look 
more like pipe dreams.
It started on the first drive, 
when the 12th-ranked Fighting 

Irish used a few big plays to 
score in less than 90 seconds. 
Michigan punted, and at the end 
of Notre Dame’s next possession, 
the South Bend crowd was in 
hysterics once again.
Quarterback 
Brandon 
Wimbush lobbed a deep ball 
downfield, and Irish receiver 
Chris Hinke leaped over safety 
Brad Hawkins, hauling it in 
and putting the Wolverines in 
a hole. In the blink of an eye, it 
was 14-0.
No. 14 Michigan (0-1) spent 
the rest of its much-anticipated 
opener trying to play catch-up, 
but it never clawed back, losing, 
24-17.

“The guys really prepared 
well for this ballgame,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Not the outcome we anticipated 
or wanted, but we’ve just got 
to dig deep, make no excuses. 
Credit to Notre Dame and move 
on to next week.”
It 
ultimately 
was 
the 
first 
half 
that 
did 
Michigan 
in. 
Notre 
Dame 
(1-0) 
scored 
again 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
on a methodical, 
15-play 
march 
aided 
by 
penalties.
All 
the 
offensive 
production the Fighting Irish 
needed came before halftime.
“Second half I think we found 
our groove a little bit more,” 
said fifth-year senior defensive 
end Chase Winovich. “This 
might be a hot take. I don’t mean 
it to be. They’re a great football 
team and stuff, but I just didn’t 

feel like they dominated us. I 
just felt like they went up and 
made some 50/50 plays.”
Maybe Winovich is on to 
something, because there were 
several moments when it seemed 
like momentum was starting to 
turn in the Wolverines’ favor, but 
those 
moments 
never bred any 
substance.
Sophomore 
Ambry 
Thomas 
answered Notre 
Dame’s 
third 
touchdown 
with a 99-yard 
kick 
return 
touchdown 
on 
the 
next 
play, 
but 
halftime 
came before any 
momentum could be sustained.
In the second half, Michigan’s 
vaunted defense finally found 
its rhythm. They gave up 233 
yards in the first half and just 
71 in the second, but the offense 
flubbed its chances.
The Wolverines even drove 
down the field their first chance 

after halftime, highlighted by a 
54-yard bomb from Patterson to 
sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins. But that chance was 
thwarted when junior punter 
Will Hart bobbled the snap on a 
would-be field goal.
Then, 
fifth-year 
senior 
Brandon Watson 
intercepted a pass 
to give Michigan 
yet 
another 
opportunity 
to 
crawl back into 
things.
And yet again, 
the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t.
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
game, 
Michigan 
made 
one final push, 
scoring with just over two 
minutes to go on a short run 
from senior running back Karan 
Higdon. The Wolverines got the 
ball back moments later after 
forcing a three-and-out. 
But this time, Patterson, who 
finished the day 20-of-30 for 
227 yards and an interception, 

fumbled while running from 
a defender for the umpteenth 
time of the night. 
“Nobody really wants to start 
off like that,” Patterson said. 
“Our defense and our special 
teams put us in really good 
situations to make something 
happen. … Just 
gonna go back 
and learn from 
the tape.”
The offensive 
line, which was 
already 
being 
questioned, 
could 
never 
consistently 
keep Patterson 
upright. 
The 
offense 
that 
struggled 
all 
of last season fell short when it 
counted.
The Wolverines left South 
Bend with many of the problems 
they said they had fixed.
The season isn’t over — not by 
a long shot.
But the hype? The hype is all 
but gone.

Collins inspires confidence from his teammates in No. 2 receiving role 

Amid fans airing grievances 
after 
the 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 24-17 loss at Notre Dame, 
it was difficult to focus on 
anything but the negatives of the 
Wolverines’ performance.
But with 48 hours to digest 
Saturday night’s game, a big 
picture outlook of Michigan 
football is in order. Or in other 
words, every cloud has a silver 
lining.
It was Week 1, with new 
offensive pieces, against a ranked 
team, in the Fighting Irish’s 
own stadium, nonetheless. The 
defense, especially in the second 
half, 
was 
mostly 
consistent 
and junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson showed glimpses of 
why he was already a fan favorite.
But no player took a leap and 
inspired new confidence like 
sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins.
“He seems to be catching 
everything,” said junior left 
guard Ben Bredeson prior to 
Saturday’s game, a foretell of 
his expanded role. “I’m no wide 
receivers coach here … but it 
seems 
like 
whenever 
we’re 
getting into the red zone or 
something like that — we need a 
touchdown — Nico is usually the 
guy getting it for us.”
The 
6-foot-4 
Collins 
was 
thrown into the No. 2 spot on the 
depth chart after Tarik Black’s 
foot injury. Hype swirled around 
as chatter surfaced about what 
the unproven Collins could do to 
fill the void left by Black.
“Before he got hurt, we always 
talked about what we would do in 
a game together — celebrations 
and whatever we had,” Collins 
said. “When he went down, our 
receivers got together and was 
like ‘Alright, let’s do it for Tarik.’ ”
Collins didn’t find the end 
zone on Saturday, but hauled in 
three catches for 66 yards in his 
starting debut — he tallied just 

three catches for 27 yards all of 
last season. The numbers don’t 
pop, but Collins proved his worth.
On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
offensive drive of the season, 
Collins caught Patterson’s first 
passing attempt at Michigan 
with 
a 
trips 
screen 
pass, 
barreling eight yards after the 
catch through junior tight end 
Sean McKeon’s blocks.
To begin the second quarter, 
Collins was split left, and caught 
a six-yard slant for the first down 
inside the red zone.
And for his final reception, 

to start the second half, Collins 
outran Notre Dame cornerback 
Julian Love on a deep post 
and snagged an underthrown, 
52-yard heave.
“Loved the big play,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Thought he did a great job of 
running his route, burst of speed 
and did a great job of tracking the 
ball — and that fantastic catch.
“Blocked well and consistently 
ran good routes the whole game.”
Added Collins: “It meant a 
lot to this team. We made an 
adjustment at the halftime. After 

I caught that we were just like 
‘Okay, let’s go score the ball.’ 
Made a little spark to the offense, 
move the ball.”
For Collins, the promotion 
was 
quick, 
but 
seamless. 
Another year corrected a lot of 
mental lapses according to him, 
and being the next man up is 
something he’s been ready for 
since the spring.
“Last year I wasn’t ready, didn’t 
really know anything my first 
year,” Collins said. “The playbook 
is a whole different level than 
what I was used to in high school. 

Just having that first year under 
my belt, learning from freshman 
year, it kinda brought a little juice 
to me in the spring.”
But it wasn’t Collins’ own 
development that improved, but 
his connection with Patterson. 
According to Collins, Patterson 
is unlike any quarterback he has 
played with before, a proposition 
that forced Collins to change his 
attitude when running routes.
“With him, the play isn’t 
over,” Collins said. “We’re all 
trying to find ways to get open. 
Scramble drill and find the open 

spot. … He’s a really explosive 
quarterback. He can find ways to 
get the ball to you and find ways 
to make plays.”
For an otherwise stagnant 
offense, Collins’ consistency was 
a flower in a dirt field. Losing 
Black, of course, was painful. But 
after 60 minutes of Collins in the 
starting rotation, Black’s absence 
did not seem like a make-or-
break loss. For a Michigan team 
looking to rebound, it can be 
thankful that it has at least one 
less issue that doesn’t need 
urgent help.

Sophomore wide receiver notches three catches for 66 yards as one of the lone offensive bright spots against Notre Dame

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Sophomore wide receiver Nico Collins says he “wasn’t ready” and “didn’t really know anything (his) first year,” but his leading receiving performance on Saturday shows how far he has come since.

A different kind of pain

S

OUTH BEND, Ind. — 

The gift-
wrapping 
was pretty 
on the 
Michigan 
football 
team.
Through 
talk of 
renewed 
confidence, 
heightened athleticism 
and, finally, a serviceable 
quarterback, the 14th-ranked 
Wolverines were supposed 
to have a fighting chance 
against No. 12 Notre Dame in 
South Bend.
But right at kickoff of 
Saturday night’s season 
opener, the grandeur of it all 
had faded without return. 
That gift-
wrapping was 
a photocopy of 
the rhythmless, 
frustrating 
Michigan 
team from last 
year. The only 
difference 
was that the 
2018 team had 
everything 
it needed to 
succeed, and it still didn’t in 
its 24-17 loss to the Fighting 
Irish (1-0 overall).
“Just a few (big plays), not 
enough,” said a stone-faced 
Jim Harbaugh in the post-
game press conference. “We 
didn’t make enough explosive 
plays, we didn’t run the ball 
as well as we would like.
“I don’t really have all the 
biggest takeaways. I thought 
on defense our guys played 
fast, competed hard. There’s 
improvements to be made, 
mistakes were made but I 
thought they fought hard.”
With 1:48 remaining, 
down by a touchdown, the 
Wolverines (0-1) looked to 
put that narrative to bed and 
place the pieces for another 
rivalry classic. But on the 
fourth play of the drive, the 
offensive line collapsed and 
the football was knocked out 
of Shea Patterson’s hands into 
those of Notre Dame’s Khalid 
Kareem to seal the game. 
Throughout the contest, the 
Wolverines wore the mental 
anguish of an early 14-0 
deficit on their sleeve in a 
loss it could have avoided.
“It’s one of those things 

where you come off the 
sideline like ‘where did we 
go wrong?’ ” said fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich. “ I didn’t feel 
like they were dominating. I 
didn’t feel like their presence 
was overwhelming.”
It’s the same result. A 
different kind of pain. One 
rooted in its potential to be 
everything that the 2017 team 
wasn’t.
Last year’s Michigan team 
carried few expectations, 
excepting the rabid fan 
pacing in front of their 
television. A quarterback 
carousel behind a porous 
offensive line made the 
Wolverines’ offense an 
eyesore.
When Michigan’s defense 
could no longer carry the 
rest of the team’s water 
and it lost, 
exasperation 
trumped 
anger. The 
offense was 
that bad — 
Michigan had 
no business 
winning in 
any of its 
defeats and 
that sobering 
feeling of 
acceptable pain persisted.
Flash forward to Sept. 1 
at Notre Dame Stadium, and 
the loss was still deserved, 
yet more unsettling than 
it would have 
been 365 days 
ago. In junior 
Shea Patterson 
looked a capable 
offensive 
torchbearer 
while 
sophomore 
wide receivers 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
and Nico Collins 
— who hauled a 52-yard 
bomb thanks to solid pass 
protection — took the next 
step to be viable receiving 
options. The whole defense 
showed spurts of why they 
belonged in the discussion as 
the nation’s best defense.
But none of it mattered. 
On Saturday, it was one step 
forward, two steps back.
“The first game is always 
the toughest because no 
matter how hard your camp 
is, that first game is always 
tougher,” Winovich said. 
“I feel like they maybe did 

a better job adapting to it 
and took advantage of our 
lack of whatever - not being 
prepared enough.”
On three different 
occasions after a third down 
stand, Michigan’s defense 
was penalized to extend 
the Fighting Irish’s drives. 
All three of Notre Dame’s 
touchdowns came from those 
instances. The ejection of 
junior safety Josh Metellus 
from an early targeting call 
exacerbated the defensive 
deficiencies.
The Wolverines made it 
into the red zone just twice 
in the first three quarters, 
converting only one field goal 
and botching the attempt on 
the other.
Sophomore Ambry Thomas 
had a 99-yard kickoff 
return touchdown to bring 
the halftime deficit to a 
manageable 21-10 margin. 
Michigan didn’t find paydirt 
again until it was too little, 
too late.
“Nobody really wants to 
start off like that,” Patterson 
said. “Our defense put us in 
situations to make something 
happen. Early on, I took a 
sack that put us out of field 
goal range, I threw a careless 
pick. And at the end of the 
game, ball security.”
Added Winovich: “I’m not 
really sure where they beat 
us, I’m still confused in the 
locker room. I’m just kinda 
confused how 
we lost that 
game. I didn’t 
feel like they 
dominated us, 
but ultimately 
they made 
plays when 
they needed 
to.”
In a game 
where the 
Fighting Irish 
were doing everything in 
their power to let Michigan 
come back, it never came. 
Of course, it is only the first 
game and that potential may 
still emanate down the road. 
But Saturday night’s miscues 
were expected to happen in 
the 2017 season. It wasn’t 
supposed to happen in 2018.
But both are losses. This 
one just stings the Wolverines 
a little bit more.

Defense suffers untimely mistakes 
against Fighting Irish in South Bend

SOUTH BEND, Ind. 
— As 
the 43-yard rainbow heave 
approached 
the 
endzone, 
Brad Hawkins sensed an 
interception. But just as the 
sophomore 
safety 
lurched 
his hands above his head 
to make the play, receiver 
Chris 
Finke 
snatched the 
pass away for 
Notre Dame’s 
second 
touchdown of 
the evening.
It 
was 
emblematic of 
the mistakes 
that 
cost 
Michigan’s 
defense 
on 
Saturday 
in 
South Bend: not glaring in 
nature but made in moments 
that proved costly.
Just take what happened 
earlier in that drive. On 
third-and-nine 
deep 
in 
Fighting 
Irish 
territory, 
safety 
Josh 
Metellus 
led 
with his head trying to knock 
down a pass, adding 15-yards 
to the Notre Dame reception 
and forcing an early exit for 
the junior.
Four snaps later, Brandon 
Wimbush 
underthrew 
Finke, but — inexperienced 
and fresh onto the field to 
replace Metellus — Hawkins 
couldn’t 
complete 
the 
interception. And just like 
that, the Wolverines found 
themselves down 14-0.
“(Wimbush) 
made 
plays, 
and 
ultimately 
we 
didn’t,” 
said 
fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich. 
“That’s 
what 
football’s all about — making 
plays when you need to.”
And 
all 
too 
often, 
especially in the first half, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
couldn’t stop Notre Dame 
from making those plays.
Despite previous accuracy 
concerns, Wimbush stared 
down Michigan’s pressure, 

completing 
crossing 
patterns over the middle or 
deep seam routes for clutch 
conversions. His legs helped, 
too, 
extending 
plays 
and 
evading defenders for extra 
yards.
This 
combination 
was 
especially 
effective 
in 
continuing drives, as the 
Fighting Irish went 5-for-8 
on third down 
during 
the 
first 
half. 
No 
matter 
what 
the Wolverines 
threw 
at 
Wimbush, 
he 
answered 
the 
bell.
And 
sometimes, 
Michigan 
just gave it to 
Notre 
Dame, 
too. 
Including 
Metellus’ 
ejection, five penalties (42 
yards) were accepted against 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
on 
Saturday.
None was more detrimental 
than a roughing-the-passer 
call 
late 
in 
the 
second 
quarter against Winovitch. 
After 
momentarily 
getting a stop 
on 
third-
and-goal, the 
penalty 
gave 
the 
Fighting 
Irish a fresh 
set of downs 
and, 
later, 
four 
points 
on 
a 
Jafar 
Armstrong 
touchdown run.
“I didn’t necessarily agree 
with this call because I 
was rushing from the left 
side — he’s a right-handed 
quarterback — (the referee) 
told me I hit him in the back, 
and that’s why they called 
it,” Winovich said. “Not sure 
how that makes any sense.”
It 
all 
culminated 
in 
defensive shredding in the 
first half — Notre Dame 
racked up 233 total yards 
and 21 points — far from the 

norm for Michigan’s defense.
Still, things quieted down 
in the second half, when 
the Wolverines allowed less 
than 70 yards and a lone 
field goal. Winovich already 
recognizes this as a change 
from last year’s team.
“I think last year, things 
went 
(astray),” 
Winovich 
said. “You see it in the South 
Carolina game. I think if we 
had that mindset, I think 
they could’ve really done 
some damage on us.”
Michigan’s 
defense 
was 
supposed to be its greatest 
strength. It has been the 
last four seasons, finishing 
inside the top ten in yards 
allowed 
from 
2014-2017. 
And nine returning starters 
from last year’s defense 
— including potential first 
round picks Rashan Gary, 
Devin Bush, Khaleke Hudson 
and Lavert Hill — made for 
lofty preseason expectations 
around an offense with a 
new identity. 
“I 
definitely 
feel 
that 
pressure,” 
Winovich 
said. 
“That’s just the way it’s been 
(from a) factual standpoint. 
It’s 
been 
a 
defensive-led 
group the last 
couple years.”
But 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
— 
between 
penalties 
and 
third 
downs 
— 
certainly 
had its share 
of 
lapses 
on 
Saturday. And when those 
mistakes are compounded 
with plays like that of Finke 
and Wimbush, it makes for a 
losing formula.
“It’s one of those things 
where you come off the 
sideline, and for me, I didn’t 
know 
where 
we 
(went) 
wrong,” Winovich said. “I 
didn’t feel like they were 
dominating, I didn’t feel like 
they were overwhelming us. 
They made plays and beat 
us.”

Field hockey splits against UMass and UConn

Maggie Bettez had Friday’s 
game circled on her calendar for 
two years.
The 
senior 
midfielder 
is 
originally from Acton, Mass., but 
the Michigan field hockey team 
hadn’t played in her home state 
during her college career until this 
past weekend. Her friends and 
family came out to cheer her on, a 
moment she won’t soon forget.
And 
the 
game 
didn’t 
disappoint, 
either. 
The 
fifth-
ranked Wolverines (1-3 overall) 
picked up their first win of the 
season 
against 
Massachusetts 
(2-2), commanding the game from 
the start in a 5-0 victory.
Despite not scoring until the 
25th minute — when senior 
forward Emma Way launched 
a reverse shot that found the 
back of the cage — Michigan 
smothered the Minutewomen. 
Massachusetts had just two shots 
the entire game and failed to draw 

a single penalty corner.
The Wolverines complemented 
that defense with an offensive 
onslaught. 
Sophomore 
back 
Halle O’Neill and senior back 
Regan Leavitt both scored goals 
after corners. Junior forward 
Meg Dowthwaite 
tallied 
her 
first 
goal of the season 
late in the first half 
and Way added to 
the tally early in 
the second.
“The 
first 
four games this 
year 
were 
all 
very 
challenging 
and we’ve been 
knocking 
on 
the 
doorstep 
of 
winning for the whole year so far,” 
Bettez said. “So to get the first win 
was … a confidence booster and it 
came at a good time for us.”
The victory came just in time for 
the Wolverines’ Sunday matchup 
with No. 1 Connecticut (4-0), the 
reigning national champion. But 

Michigan wasn’t fazed by the top 
competition. Though they lost, 
2-1, the Wolverines used their 
underdog status to take risks with 
their game, several of which paid 
off.
“We wanted to go right at 
them,” 
Bettez 
said. “We played 
confident rather 
than 
worrying 
about each little 
play.”
When 
Way 
stole 
the 
ball 
from a Husky 
defender 
and 
punched it in the 
goal less than 
five minutes into 
the game, it only 
bolstered that confidence.
At first, Michigan was able to 
fend off Connecticut’s relentless 
pressure. Freshman goalkeeper 
Anna Spieker made 11 saves 
and the corner defense kept the 
Huskies from scoring on their first 
eight penalty opportunities.

“(Spieker) made some really 
key saves,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “Made some 
wonderful decisions back there, 
just played with a lot of confidence, 
so I think that helps our defense 
feel confident.”
But early in the second half, 
the Huskies evened the score on 
a rebound after a save and scored 
the winning goal off a penalty 
corner with 10 minutes remaining. 
Michigan could only manage a 
lone corner and one shot on goal 
the entire period.
The Wolverines scored first 
and led for over half the game, 
but 
Connecticut 
dominated 
possession 
throughout. 
That 
was the dichotomy that made 
Michigan’s loss seem at once 
a 
disappointment 
and 
an 
inevitability.
“We took a lot away that we can 
build on,” Bettez said. “… Playing a 
full 70 minutes. We have spurts of 
fantastic play (but) it’s important 
to be consistent for the entire 
game.”

Michigan shut out by 
Wake Forest on road

The ball sailed from the 
corner towards the center of 
the scrum, right to the waiting 
Janiece Joyner. The freshman 
defender leaped into the air to 
head the ball into the goal in 
the 22nd minute.
But the ball went wide of 
the net by mere inches, and 
the Michigan women’s soccer 
team’s 
chance 
at 
scoring 
was gone. The rest of the 
game proved barren for the 
Wolverines, as they lost to 
Wake Forest, 4-0, on Thursday.
“Disappointed in the result 
tonight,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein in a statement, 
the only comment provided 
after the loss. “Never a good 
feeling to lose but hopefully 
this game is a moment for us 
as a team to regroup, refocus 
and 
improve 
in our areas of 
weakness. This 
will make us 
better.”
For the first 
26 minutes, the 
game appeared 
to 
be 
evenly 
matched. 
Neither 
the 
Wolverines 
nor the Demon 
Deacons were 
generating 
scoring 
chances 
— Michigan had no shots to 
Wake Forest’s one. But when 
the Demon Deacons scored 
their first goal, the floodgates 
opened.
In the 26th minute, fifth-
year senior forward Taylor 
Timko defended Wake Forest’s 
Estelle Laurier in the top 
corner of the field, trying to 
prevent her from getting a 
shot on goal. Laurier was able 
to sneak past Timko and found 
her 
teammate 
— 
forward 
Ryanne Brown — for the finish 

into the net.
Fifty-five 
seconds 
later, 
the Demon Deacons scored 
again — this time, Laurier 
found twine from 10 yards 
out. The Wolverines regained 
possession and charged down 
the field but were caught 
offsides.
In 
total, 
Michigan 
was 
offsides 
seven 
times 
throughout 
the 
game 
— 
including five in the first half. 
It could have been a sign of an 
offense trying to gain some 
momentum and pushing just a 
bit too fast, but it could also be 
symptomatic of a young team 
trying to find footing in its 
first road game of the year.
The Wolverines’ starting 11 
included four sophomores and 
a freshman — already a fairly 
young lineup. But Michigan’s 
youth showed further, as it 
substituted in a total of eight 
players. Four of 
the eight subs 
were freshmen 
and 
just 
one 
— 
redshirt 
junior 
Katie 
Foug — was an 
upperclassman.
The frequent 
substitutions 
by Klein show 
signs that the 
young 
team 
isn’t 
settled 
yet. 
The 
offense 
visibly 
lacked 
chemistry, 
with 
passes frequently missing the 
intended target. It took until 
late in the second half for 
the Wolverines to penetrate 
the 
Wake 
Forest 
defense 
and create real chances to 
score. By then, the Demon 
Deacons’ four-goal lead was 
insurmountable.

Given 
Michigan’s 

inexpereince, 
it 
may 
take 
time for it to build chemistry 
and find its stride — just as it 
showed in Thursday’s loss.

LEO occupies administration building as contract expires

ALEC COHEN / DAILY
Lecturers and LEO supporters march from the Michigan League to the Fleming Administration Building in support of the Lecturers Union April 6, 2018. 

On Friday afternoon, about 
30 members of the Lecturers’ 
Employee 
Organization 
occupied a floor of the Fleming 
Administration 
Building. 
Lecturers camped outside of 
University of Michigan Provost 
Martin 
Philbert’s 
office. 
Philbert was not present at 
the time. They also delivered 
handwritten 
messages 
from 
allies written in support of the 
union’s efforts to negotiate 
a 
new 
contract 
with 
the 
University.
LEO President Ian Robinson 
said when the union dropped 
off 
similar 
messages 
two 
weeks ago, Philbert responded 
through an associate and said 
“he wasn’t impressed by that.” 
Union members doubled their 

efforts, leaving more letters 
outside Philbert’s office.
“We came here to deliver 
messages to the provost,” he 
said. “We knew in advance, we 
had been told he wouldn’t be 
here, so we decided we would 
come here and just stay for a 
little just to demonstrate our 
seriousness because this is a 
very, very important matter. 
The term is coming to an end 
and this is the last day of the 
contract, but we’re not going 
away. 
We’re 
determined 
to 
make a breakthrough.”
Representing 
nearly 
1,700 
non-tenure-track 
faculty 
members across the University’s 
three 
campuses, 
LEO 
has 
prioritized 
higher 
wages, 
improved equity adjustments 
and 
enhanced 
benefits 
throughout 
the 
bargaining 
process, 
which 
began 
last 

semester and nearly resulted 
in a walkout earlier this month. 
Union members have blamed 
a lack of “political will” on the 
part 
of 
the 
administration, 
including 
the 
provost, 
for 
stalemates in negotiations.
University Provost Philbert 
did not respond to a request for 
a comment.
LEO’s 
current 
contract 
expires Friday, April 20, but 
the terms of that contract will 
remain in effect until either 
LEO or the University decides to 
end it. Should one of the parties 
involved announce that it no 
longer wants the contract to 
continue, the agreement would 
officially end 30 days later.
Robinson 
said 
several 
more bargaining sessions are 
scheduled before the current 
academic term ends on Monday, 
April 30.

“That’s 
an 
important 
deadline,” 
Robinson 
said. 
“If we don’t come up with 
an agreement that we can 
recommend to our members 
by that time, we can’t sign a 
tentative agreement under our 
LEO constitution until the fall 
when our members return. If we 
wanna get this thing resolved 
before fall, we have to do it by 
the end of this month.”
According 
to 
Robinson, 
LEO’s bargaining team can 
schedule more sessions with the 
University if necessary.
“I actually don’t believe we 
need a whole lot of meetings to 
resolve the remaining issues,” 
Robinson said. “Mainly, they’re 
just about amounts of money. 
Either you are willing to pay the 
money or you’re not, and if you 
are willing to pay it, it doesn’t 
take very long to figure out how 

to do that.”
Salary has been a particularly 
controversial issue throughout 
negotiations. 
Currently, 
the 
minimum starting salary for 
a lecturer is $34,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. Union 
leadership 
called 
off 
a 
potential strike only after the 
administration 
offered 
an 
increase of more than $10,000 
to the starting salary in Ann 
Arbor and more than $8,700 in 
Flint and Dearborn.
In 
an 
email, 
University 
spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen 
wrote, 
“The 
university 
continues to bargain in good 
faith this afternoon and next 
week with LEO.”
Lecturers staged the sit-
in after holding a block party 
in Regents’ Plaza to thank 
students and other allies for 

their 
support. 
Some 
LEO 
members 
voiced 
concern 
that 
with 
students 
leaving 
campus, the union’s bargaining 
campaign could suffer a loss of 
momentum.
Margot 
Finn, 
a 
lecturer 
in 
American 
culture 
and 
University courses, said she 
hopes the support LEO has 
enjoyed 
from 
students 
and 
allies continues.
“It is hard to organize on 
college campuses because of the 
ebb and flow of the semesters,” 
Finn 
said. 
“I 
think 
LEO 
members will continue showing 
up and I think a lot of the 
community 
allies, 
especially 
tenure-track faculty, will. I’ve 
seen so much commitment from 
the students, and I hope that 
continues into the fall. It’s just 
hard to predict the future.”

Greene and Baer of MVision 
win CSG executive positions

Public Policy junior Daniel 
Greene and LSA sophomore 
Izzy Baer will serve as 
the 2018-19 University of 
Michigan Central Student 
Government president and 
vice president, respectively, 
according to election results 
released late Friday evening. 
Representatives running on 
their ticket, MVision, also 
won a plurality of seats in 
the assembly.
Greene 
and 
Baer 
defeated the second-place 
MomentUM party executive 
candidates, 
Engineering 
junior A.J. Ashman and LSA 
junior Charlie Bingham, by 
a margin of 1,512 votes— 
more than 77 percent more 
votes.
Business 
junior 
Arathi 
Sabada and LSA sophomore 
Marianne Drysdale of the 
True Blue party came in 
third 
with 
1,464 
votes. 
Reggie Bee, a corgi known 
around 
the 
University 
campus, 
finished 
fourth 
with 1,403 votes, eMpower 
— headed by Public Health 
senior Lloyd Lyons and LSA 
sophomore Frank Guzman 
— tallied 771 votes and LSA 
junior Sujay Shetty and Law 
student Matthew Williams 
of aMplify came in sixth. 
Student turnout measured 
at 23.9 percent, an increase 
from last year’s 17.9 percent.
Friday’s results are still 
unofficial, as the body’s 

election commission has yet 
to certify results. 
Reggie Bee, the corgi, 
placed 
fourth. 
However, 
he 
is 
ineligible 
to 
hold 
office and was disqualified. 
Controversy 
grew 
on 
social media meme pages 
about whether votes were 
wasted on Reggie, with the 
popular 
dog’s 
Facebook 
page even urging students 
to cast ballots for eligible 

candidates.
The 
MVision 
platform 
focused 
on 
increasing 
resources 
for 
Counseling 
and Psychological Services 
and 
the 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention and Awareness 
Center. Greene and Baer 
expressed that these goals, 
and the entirety of their 
platform, 
was 
rooted 
in 
direct experience. In the 
same vein, the two hope to 

bring attention and support 
to 
those 
experiencing 
oppression 
from 
their 
“invisible 
identities.” 
During the campaign, the 
ticket also advocated for 
monthly 
town 
halls 
and 
open dialogues in response 
to immediate “high impact” 
events on campus.
Prior 
to 
running 
for 
executive 
office, 
Greene 
and Baer both served in 
representative roles in CSG, 
with Baer acting as the 
assembly’s vice speaker in 
the winter semester. 
Greene said he thought 
there were many valuable 
ideas 
in 
other 
party’s 
platforms which he would 
work to include in his own 
agenda as president.
“I think that what I’m 
doing in this coming week 
is 
bridging 
relationships 
with the other candidates 
and parties. I want to make 
sure that their voices aren’t 
lost,” Greene said. “They 
bring a lot of institutional 
knowledge and opportunity 
and phenomenal platform 
points that, although they 
weren’t a part of necessarily 
the 
MVision 
platform, 
they 
definitely 
speak 
to 
student concerns on our 
campus, 
and 
regardless 
of what platform I ran on, 
those 
parties 
and 
those 
candidates brought ideas to 
the table that should not be 
dismissed based upon the 
election victory.”

Revised sexual misconduct 
policy redefines harassment

The University of Michigan 
is 
updating 
their 
policy 
and 
procedures on Student Sexual 
and 
Gender-Based 
Misconduct 
and Other Forms of Interpersonal 
Violence in accordance with the 
policy’s annual review. E. Royster 
Harper, vice president for Student 
Life, announced the policy changes 
via email to students and faculty 
Thursday.
According to the email, the 
University is required to hold the 
annual review to consider existing 
policies and make revisions as 
needed. 
The 
University 
and 
representatives from the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution, the 
Office for Institutional Equity, the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center and the Office 
of the Vice President and General 
Counsel conducted the review.
The definition of gender-based 
harassment will be changed to 
include the resolution of harassment 
cases that intersect with other 
federally protected identities such 
as race, national origin, disability 
or veteran status. The definition of 
intimate partner violence has been 
revised as well to emphasize that 
the University believes emotional 
abuse is a reoccurring behavior and 
not an isolated incident.
In an effort to improve the 
sanctioning process, cases that used 
to be heard by a voluntary board 
of OIE and OSCR-trained faculty, 
staff and student representatives 
will now be heard by professional 
OSCR staff. This approach will 
reportedly ensure professionals 

with significant training will be 
responsible for determining proper 
sanctions.
Rackham 
student 
Kamaria 
Porter, who currently serves on 
the 
sanctioning 
board, 
wrote 
in an email she understood the 
volunteer board may have been 
an unsustainable process due to 
competing schedules and the large 
time commitment of case review 
sessions.
“Being on the board is a huge, 
unpaid 
time 
commitment,” 
Porter wrote. “It includes reading 
sometimes hundreds of pages, 
deliberating for hours, and follow 
up emails. In addition, we had an 
8 hour training. Sometimes things 
come up and board members 
can’t be available. That model 
doesn’t seem sustainable in terms 
of securing volunteers who are 
already deeply involved in a 
professional job, serving as faculty, 
or pursuing a degree full time. 
Finally, the option of mediation 
between an accuser and the 
respondent is now available in cases 
of non-penetrative sexual assault.
Last week, OIE released its 
annual report on prohibited student 
conduct, 
which 
found 
sexual 
misconduct reports increased by 
40 percent from 2016.
In addition to Harper’s email, 
the University also released a 
statement in the University Record. 
Pamela Heatile, the University’s 
Title IX coordinator and senior 
director of OIE, said these policy 
revisions both make the document 
more comprehensible and assist in 
the resolution of gender and sexual 
misconduct cases.
“We are confident that these 

changes will make the policy and 
procedures clearer and easier to 
understand, while also addressing 
some important changes that are 
significant to the adjudication of 
these cases,” Heatlie said.
According 
to 
the 
U.S. 
Department of Education website, 
Title IX states, “No person shall, 
on the basis of sex, be excluded 
from participation in, be denied 
the benefits of, or be subjected 
to 
discrimination 
under 
any 
education program or activity 
receiving 
Federal 
financial 
assistance.” In accordance with 
Title IX, any applicable institution 
is required to hold a self-evaluation 
as a guarantee that the institution 
is actively working to eliminate 
gender-based discrimination.
In the past, the University 
has been investigated by the U.S. 
Department of Education for their 
handling of a sexual misconduct 
case in 2014. The University was 
later criticized by students for 
failing to release reports of the 
investigation.
In collaboration with the Obama 
administration, the DOE’s Office 
for Civil Rights released a “Dear 
Colleague” letter to universities 
in 2011 as a commitment to Title 
IX, which obligated universities to 
respond to sexual assault claims 
promptly. 
However, 
activists 
now fear much of the progress 
which was accomplished under 
former President Obama will be 
reversed by current U.S. Secretary 
of Education Betsy DeVos and the 
Trump administration.

Game over for Michigan Time

LSA sophomore Lexi Michaels 
wasn’t expecting to be late to her 
Psychology 280 exam. In fact, 
she thought she was early. But 
when she walked into the testing 
accommodations room a few 
minutes after 2:30 — she’d run 
there right from her last class — 
she realized the exam was not 
being administered on Michigan 
time, and everyone else had 
already started.
“My expectation was that 
it would (start on Michigan 
time), 
because 
that’s 
what 
most of my classes and exams 
start on, even if they’re in a 
testing accommodations room,” 
Michaels said. “And it didn’t. I 
walked in really flustered. I was 
like, ‘Are they going to let me take 
the exam?’”
After 
the 
initial 
scare, 
everything turned out fine for 
Michaels. She was still given a 
full two hours to take her exam, 
and no one was angry at her for 
coming in late. However, start 
time confusion is common at the 
University of Michigan, and the 
administration has decided it’s 
time to take action.
Starting May 1, no University 
classes will run on Michigan 
time, the 10 minute late-start built 
into most undergraduate classes 
at the University. Michigan time 
is a University tradition that 
dates back to the 1930s. Students 
and professors used to time their 
classes according to the chimes of 
the Burton Tower at the beginning 
of each hour, and Michigan time 
was officially adopted to allow 
students to get from class to class 
without being late. Now, to allow 
for students to get to back-to-back 
classes, all classes will stop 10 
minutes before the hour.
Though administrators have 
been talking about removing 
Michigan time for many years 
now — University Provost Martin 
Philbert said there have been 
conversations since he came to 
the University in 1995 — this is the 
first time anything conclusive has 
passed. The change will start in 
May for the Spring and Summer 
terms, so any unexpected kinks 

can be worked out before the Fall 
2018 semester.
“The freshmen will come in 
not knowing a time we had it,” 
Philbert said.
 According to Philbert, it was a 
“tradition born out of necessity.”
Now, 
however, 
some 
see 
the 
once-crucial 
tradition 
as a hindrance. Many newer 
University schools never adopted 
it, and Patricia Hurn, dean of the 
School of Nursing, told The Daily 
in an email Michigan time was 
never an option for the Nursing 
School.
“The major reason our classes 
have not used Michigan Time 
is because we are a clinical 
discipline,” Hurn wrote. “So we 
very early on aligned our class 
times, specifically the on-the-
hour start time, with the time 
of our clinical partners. None 
of these partners recognize or 
utilize ‘Michigan time.’”
Problems 
arise 
when 
University units aren’t operating 
on synchronized schedules, and 
because programs like Nursing 
don’t have the option of Michigan 
time, Philbert thinks going to 
“clock time” is the most logical 
course of action.
One of the major issues the new 
system aims to fix is the shortage 
of 
classrooms. 
When 
some 
schools are on Michigan time and 

others are not, classrooms are 
unavailable for up to 10 minutes at 
the end of the hour.
“We have the need for more 
classrooms,” 
Philbert 
said. 
“We have more sections, which 
require more rooms, and some of 
these rooms require specialized 
services. So by aligning time, we 
free up the number and types of 
classrooms available.”
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University is 
also hoping the switch will make 
collaboration 
among 
different 
schools and departments easier.
“I’d say one of the hallmarks 
of our campus is cross-University 
collaboration,” Fitzgerald said. 
“From school and colleges and 
departments 
and 
different 
units who are constantly cross-
pollinating all of our efforts, and 
this really facilitates that… We’re 
just eliminating one of those 
stumbling blocks.”
Though there are clear benefits 
for faculty and administrators, 
students are uncertain about the 
upcoming change. Michaels, even 
after her exam confusion, thinks 
Michigan time works well. She’s 
concerned professors will have a 
difficult time stopping 10 minutes 
short of the hour.
“I really like Michigan time. 
I think it makes so much sense, 
especially when you have back-

to-back classes,” she said. “It gets 
your day rolling. I think that (this 
new system) is just a cause for 
disaster. I think that professors 
are way more aware of starting 10 
minutes late because they haven’t 
started yet, but if they have to end 
10 minutes early, they’re not going 
to know to stop.”
While Michaels understands 
this could eventually be a good 
system, the thought of working 
through 
the 
transition 
next 
semester is daunting.
“It’s going to be a huge 
transition and it’s going to mess 
a lot of people up with their 
schedules,” Michaels said. “I don’t 
think this is a good idea, but that’s 
just because I’m used to Michigan 
time and I think that this is 
working well so I don’t see why 
you should change what’s already 
working and what people like.”
On the other hand, Philbert 
said he’s received a lot of positive 
feedback about the change from 
students and faculty.
“Especially 
through 
Vice 
President Royster’s office, we 
have worked with many student 
organizations,” Philbert said. “In 
my experience there’s been an 
enormous sigh of relief that we’re 
all going to be operating on the 
same expectations of starting and 
finishing.”

Students call out CSG 
guide as unreasonable

The University of Michigan’s 
Central Student Government 
released 
a 
Campus 
Affordability Guide Saturday 
and 
has 
since 
received 
backlash from many members 
of the student body. The online 
publication was widely touted 
as a “guide to cost-effective 
living 
at 
the 
University,” 
and lists a few dozen tips for 
students to cut down on costs 
in the face of rising living 
costs. 
Suggestions such as cutting 
down 
on 
housekeeping 
services, laundry delivery or 
limiting 
impulse 
purchases 
left 
low-income 
students 
incredulous. 
In a Facebook post that has 
been shared 27 times as of 
Thursday evening, LSA senior 
Zoe Proegler expressed her 
dissatisfaction with the way 
CSG approached affordability 
on campus.
“We all know Ann Arbor is 
expensive,” Proegler wrote. 
“Guides 
like 
this, 
which 
lecture 
to 
lower 
income 
students about how rich people 
think poor people can change 
a couple habits (or lightbulbs?) 
and not be poor anymore, do 
not help. Rather, they’re a slap 
in the face to people who fight 
every day to be here.”
A 2016 demographic self-
survey 
conducted 
by 
CSG 
in 2016 found 74.4 percent 
of its members come from 
households that earn over 
$100,000 a year, and 37.2 
percent 
have 
household 
incomes of over $250,000. 
According to a recent report, 
the 
University 
ranks 
last 
in economic mobility when 
compared to other top-ranked 
public universities.
“It was really immediate, 
the way that it hit me — 

something 
about 
the 
tone 
being 
off,” 
Proegler 
later 
said in an interview. “As I 
was reading it, it didn’t seem 
like 
something 
that 
had 
really taken into account the 
problems 
of 
students 
who 
are 
experiencing 
absolute 
issues with accessibility and 
affordability. It didn’t read like 
something that would actually 
be working towards improving 
accessibility for students who 
need it, and for CSG to push it 
that way was upsetting.”
Proegler brought up the 
specific points mentioned in 
the article, some of which 
she felt were out of touch and 
potentially dangerous to the 
students who would benefit 
most from this guide.
“It comes up twice in those 
first 50 points that students 
should get rid of cleaning or 
laundry service subscriptions 
in order to save money,” she 
said. “That, to me, doesn’t 
sound 
like 
they’re 
really 
addressing students who they 
intended to be targeting with 
that. The whole guide seemed 
to put CSG at a disadvantage 
in communicating what they 
were trying to do. There’s 
no way you can explain to 
somebody 
what 
a 
balance 
transfer is in two sentences. 
And to attempt to do so, is I 
think, grossly negligent.”
In a comment on Proegler’s 
Facebook 
post, 
CSG 
Vice 
President Nadine Jawad wrote 
she thought the numerous 
comments 
critiquing 
the 
guide 
misrepresented 
her 
years spent working with Ann 
Arbor City Council members, 
students and programs, such 
as the Ginsberg Center, in 
order to present options for 
students to live in Ann Arbor 
on a budget.

Bicentennial event HAILstorm! reflects on 
University history in fall festival finale

Students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members 
gathered together in Ingalls 
Mall to watch HAILstorm! 
on Friday night, the 3-D light 
show that paid tribute to the 
University of Michigan’s 200 
year legacy. The show was 
projected on the outside of 
the Rackham Building, and 
was deemed the pinnacle of 
the University of Michigan 
Bicentennial 
Celebrations. 
It 
was 
produced 
by 
the 
Bicentennial 
Office, 
Bluewater Technologies and 
Maxin10sity, and featured 
a wide variety of high-tech 
graphics 
and 
animation. 
Along 
with 
the 
show, 
there was music, food and 
festivities for spectators to 
enjoy. 
Gary 
Krenz, 
executive 
director of the University 
of Michigan Bicentennial, 
explained 
the 
goal 
of 

HAILstorm! 
was 
to 
take 
people through the history 
of the University with an 

exciting presentation.
“It’s 
a 
3-D 
projection 
mapping 
light 
show 
on 
the 
façade 
of 
Rackham,” 
Krenz said. “It’s going to 
incorporate all kinds of stuff 
from the history, present 
and future of U of M-lots of 
lights, lots of motion, a huge 
amount of energy. People are 
really going to enjoy it.”
Krenz also reflected on the 

Bicentennial celebrations as 
a whole. He discussed how 
even though the University 

enjoys showcasing all the 
good it has accomplished 
over the last 200 years, 
it’s also important to come 
together as a community to 
understand the areas where 
the institution fell short.
“When 
you 
reach 
an 
anniversary like this, you 
really can pull the whole 
community 
together 
to 
reflect,” Krenz said. “Part of 
this is to celebrate how great 

we are, but part of it is also 
to think about where we’ve 
made some mistakes, and 
how do we think about that 
as we go forward.”
Rackham student Kaitlyn 
Portal 
echoed 
Krenz’s 
statement about the value 
of bringing the community 
together. She also pointed 
out recent racist incidents on 
campus show the University 
still has areas it needs to 
improve on.
“I like the way that they 
focused on bringing the U 
of M community together, 
and 
identified 
ways 
that 
we can improve ourselves-
especially recently with the 
racial events on campus,” 
Portal said. “I think the 
campus still has issues it 
needs to work on. But, I 
think events like tonight’s 
really show us how we come 
together as a community.”
Along 
with 
areas 
for 
improvement, 
LSA 
senior 
Aiya Saad was very impressed 
with 
the 
Bicentennial 
showcase of new technology 
the University is developing. 
Saad explained she looks 
forward 
to 
seeing 
the 
diverse range of innovations 
University 
students 
and 
faculty create.
“I hope Michigan keeps 
doing what they’re doing. 
I’ve seen a lot of what people 
have been working on in 
different areas of campus, 
and I was so amazed. I hope 
to see more of that going 
forward,” Saad said.
Krenz 
hopes 
the 
Bicentennial 
celebrations 
allowed people to reflect 
on the University’s legacy, 
understand the challenges 
it 
has 
faced 
and 
obtain 
a 
stronger 
historical 
awareness going forward.

Fall 2018 — 3C

After three days of electronic 
balloting and five membership 
events spread out across the three 
campuses 
outlining 
the 
new 
contract, the Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization voted to ratify a new 
labor agreement with the University 
on July 13.
Ninety eight percent of LEO 
members voted in favor of the new 
contract which will raise wages, 
improve healthcare and boost job 
security for lecturers across the 
three campuses. The contract was 
reached and presented to the union 
members for a vote following months 
of 
negotiations 
and 
numerous 
bargaining 
sessions 
with 
the 
University. LEO represents a union 
of more than 1,700 lecturers who 
collectively teach tens of thousands 
of students at the Ann Arbor, 
Dearborn and Flint campuses.
“This agreement is a result 
of months of hard work at the 
bargaining table – and much more,” 
LEO Vice President Kirsten Herold, 
a lecturer at the U-M School of 
Public Health and manager of the 
LEO bargaining team, said in LEO’s 
official statement. “We organized. 
We marched. We rallied. We 
lobbied. And we built a coalition 
that includes students, tenure-track 
faculty, union members on and off 
the campus, elected officials and 
community allies.”
LEO’s previous contract expired 
on May 29. Since the beginning of 
the last academic year, LEO has been 
pushing for higher wages, improved 
healthcare and greater equity of 
resources across the three U-M 
campuses.
Under the new contract, as of 
September current lecturers will 
receive annual base pay raises 
ranging from $3,000 to $12,500, 
depending on the length of each 
lecturer’s 
service. 
Those 
who 

make over $80,000 will receive a 
combination of base increases and 
lump-sum payments.
By September 2020 the minimum 
salary at which the University can 
hire lecturers will increase at each 
campus. In Ann Arbor, the base 
salary will increase by 47.8 percent 
from $34,500 to $51,000. In Flint 
there will be a 50.2 percent increase 
from $27,300 to $41,000. Finally, in 
Dearborn, the starting salary will 
go from $28,300 to $41,000, a 44.9 
percent increase.
LEO President Ian Robinson said 
the new contract represents not only 
a shift in the University’s treatment 
of lecturers but also in its perception 
of lecturers.
“I would say that this is a real 
paradigm shift for our relationship 
with the University of Michigan,” 
Robinson said. “We really have 
dramatically 
improved 
the 
livelihoods of many, many of our 
members. 
Not 
everybody 
was 
poorly paid but many were and 
most of those now are at a living 
wage and the kind of wage that is 
more appropriate for a professional 
making a career teaching at the 
University of Michigan and that’s 
huge.”
Robinson 
explained 
the 
University has taken a massive step 
forward, serving as an example for 
other institutions with lecturers 
facing the same issues.
“There aren’t many, if any, other 
universities in the country that have 
made such a big change in the way 
they treat their lecturers,” Robinson 
said. “I don’t want to say this is the 
best agreement in the country, but 
I think it’s up there in the top few. 
It’s also a beacon for other lecturers 
and other universities for what 
universities can and ought to do 
around the country.”
The new contract will increase 
the University’s contribution to 
retirement income for lecturers, 
improve healthcare, enhance job 
security by modifying the lecturers’ 

performance review process and 
provide additional funding for 
professional development for the 
lecturers. As a result of the new 
contract, 
a 
labor 
management 
conference will be held during the 
Fall 2019 semester in order for LEO 
and the University administration to 
discuss their progress towards the 
goal of improving diversity among 
the population of lecturers.
While the contract is a huge 
step forward for the lecturers, both 
Herold and Robinson agree it does 
not meet all of LEO’s expectations.
“We did not achieve everything 
our members wanted, especially in 
Flint and Dearborn – that is going 
to take more than a single round of 
collective bargaining,” Herold said. 
“But this contract does recognize 
the value lecturers contribute on all 
three campuses and sets the stage 
for further improvements.” 
LEO member Steven Toth, a U-M 
Flint chemistry lecturer, said the 
discrepancy between the campuses 
can be discouraging for lecturers 
outside of the Ann Arbor campus.
“I think we should be working 
more towards equity across the 
campuses and I think it’s a pretty 
bad signal to say someone that 
teaches at Ann Arbor is worth more 
than someone who teaches at Flint 
or Dearborn,” Toth said. “I do think 
that they should be paid more due to 
the cost of living (in Ann Arbor) but 
not as dramatic as it is now.”
Similarly, Robinson said LEO 
is not done fighting to overcome 
the wage discrepancy between the 
three campuses. He believes there 
are other ways outside of collective 
bargaining to meet this need.
“Some things are bargained for 
collectively through negotiations 
and some things are much bigger,” 
Robinson said. “This is something 
that is much bigger than just a 
collective agreement.”

When Justice Isn’t Served

NARMEEN REHMAN
MiC Contributor

 I pin my scarf around my 
hair until it feels secure. The 
night is still as the call for 
prayer (athan) sings through 
my phone — I close my eyes 
and take a deep breath of 
the warm June air. I exhale 
to the cadence of the athan, 
renewing a sense of calm and 
strength in my body after 
a long day of fasting. As I 
walked down the road to my 
mosque, I reflect on the feel-
ing of security underneath 
the crescent moon of a Rama-
dan night. 
I’m sure Nabra Hassanen felt
the same. 

The headlights of a car 
zipping around the corner 
interrupt my daze and I pick 
up my pace in a small panic, 
remembering the heartbreak 
that occurred almost a year 
ago.
Earlier that day, I came 
across a video of Nabra 

Hassanen’s father responding 
to questions about the brutal 
murder of his daughter. My 
heart ached for him and I 
could see my own father in 
his cries. Last Ramadan, she 
was killed by Darwin Torres 
while walking to her mosque 
after an early morning suhoor 
(breakfast) with her friends at 
McDonald’s, a spot my friends 
have frequented at the brink 
of dawn during our Ramadan 
nights. That could’ve been 
any of my friends leaving the 
McDonald’s parking lot to 
not return again. This cut felt 
deep. It was personal.
It has been almost one year 
since Nabra Hassanen’s father 
called for justice in the name 
of his daughter, believing 
there is no doubt that she was 
targeted because she wears 
hijab.
Instead, the news was 
quick to call it “road rage.” 
Torres grabbed a bat from 

his car and furiously beat her 
face unrecognizable and the 
news said it was “it wasn’t 
about her.”
He ripped her hijab off, 
carried her limp body deep 
into the woods to assault her, 
and the police were quick to 
state it was “not a hate crime.”
sure, it could have been 
road rage — but it also could 
have been the same rage that 
prompted an individual to set 
her memorial ablaze.
This incident is far from 
isolated. It reminded me 
of years ago when bullets 
ripped through the home 
of three Muslims in North 
Carolina: Deah, Yusor, and 
Razan. Their execution-
style deaths were attributed 
to a parking dispute. When 
you witness and experience 
discrimination firsthand, 
these terms of prosecution 
begin to seem naive.
This insidious hatred 
doesn’t only target Muslim 
communities, but those 
marginalized across the 
nation.
In order for a crime to be 
classified as a hate crime, it 
must show that the crime 
clearly targets an individual 
due to their characteristics. 
However, to be a minority 
in America is to know that 
discrimination does not need 
to be overt or blatantly stated 
to be felt. To be a minority 
in America is to watch as 
the brutal murders of people 
who look like us are lessened 
to “coincidences” and are 
abandoned in the rule of law.
We know damn well it’s no 
coincidence.
We feel ourselves, our 
families, and our friends 
in each name that quickly 
passes through the ticker 
at the bottom of the news 
screen. How many lives will 
our communities lose to 
ignorance and hatred that 
will be labeled as else? Does 
America sweep the targeting 
of individuals on the basis 
of religion, race, and sexual 
identity under the rug so we 
don’t have to address the 

greater issue of toxic biases 
in America? Why do we bury 
hate under legal euphemisms 
instead of calling it out as it 
is?
In a call of remembrance 
for Nabra and justice for the 
many minorities that are 
targeted on a daily basis in 
America, I make a case for 
the hate crime. There are 
a number of reasons why 
America is uncomfortable 
labeling these offenses 
as driven by hate. This 
discomfort in itself is a sign 
that we need to debate and 
explore the semantics of them 
more.
Legally, it is complicated. 
Once it carries the label 
of a hate crime, it elevates 
a normal crime to a more 
serious offense, requiring 
greater attention from law 
enforcement. Police often 
aren’t trained on these 
matters and there is no 
uniform method to track and 
handle these crimes.
Socially, it is a symbol. Hate 
crimes say to criminals that 
bigotry will not be permitted 
in this community, state 
or nation. To communities 
targeted, it says that they 
are heard, respected and 
protected by the rule of law.
This begs the question — is 
there a reason why we don’t 
take the extra steps to make 
minority communities feel 
more safe and welcome?
One wrong interaction, 
one wrong person to cross 
paths with — this is all it 
takes. When stories of hate 
crimes air on the news, 
they’re often followed by 
my parent’s “This is why we 
tell you to be careful.” But, 
we both understand that no 
matter how careful I am, I 
can’t control those around 
me. I can’t control someone 
who wants to meet my beliefs 
with a bullet, who sees my 
brother’s skin color as a bulls-
eye or who wishes my friend’s 
hijab were a noose. I’m afraid, 
our communities are afraid 
and it’s about time our laws 
step up to protect us.

Creatives of Color: A 
revolution in creative 

When Drew Metcalf, an 
LSA junior studying screen 
arts and culture, submitted 
his 
project 
proposal 
to 
optiMize’s Social Innovation 
Challenge, he had no idea 
he would end up forming 
a 
creative 
expression 
showcase that would impact 
more than 150 students. 
With a strong passion for 
creativity and art, Metcalf 
has a natural drive for 
building 
community, 
cultural understanding and 
confidence — all through 
the power of expression. 
With his new organization, 
Creatives of Color, Metcalf 
is using art to revolutionize 
how students of color come 
together.
The purpose of Creatives of 
Color is to foster connections 
among artists of color by 
providing opportunities for 
collaboration, 
expression, 
and networking. Its platform 
is centered around providing 
support and resources to 
give students the freedom 
and means to pursue their 
creative initiatives.
Metcalf got his start from 
optiMize, a social innovation 
organization 
dedicated 
to 
inspiring 
students 
to 
initiate self-driven products 
to work toward a more 
sustainable world. Through 
optiMize, Metcalf received 
mentor support, visioning 
workshops and an expansive 
network to help him make 
his mission a tangible reality. 
To formally introduce his 
organization, Metcalf held a 
creative showcase April 11.
The showcase featured an 
expansive range of art, such 
as photography, animation, 
singing, dance, and poetry. 
It featured projects from 
25 participants of varying 
cultures, ages and majors, 
adding to the diverse makeup 
of projects presented.
In preparation for the 
showcase, 
Metcalf 
said 
he and his team randomly 
paired 
students 
together 
as he wanted to explore 
the 
creative 
capacity 
that 
could 
come 
from 
strangers. Metcalf and his 
team 
provided 
guidance 
and assistance to student 
teams. He hoped students 
would 
feel 
encouraged 
and confident enough to 

pursue creative means not 
traditionally explored.
“We wanted to showcase 
all kinds of art. When people 
think of creative work, they 
jump to music, poetry, and 
dance. But, we also have 
committees for other written 
art, 
like 
journalism 
and 
creative writing,” he said. 
Though 
the 
showcase 
received 
an 
immensely 
positive response, it did not 
occur without setbacks and 
moments of discouragement. 
As the term went on, more 
and more groups dropped 
out due to academic demands 
and other time restraints.
However, Metcalf stayed 
optimistic, 
commenting 
even if two people showed 
up to the showcase, as long 
as everyone had fun, the 
work would not go to waste.
“There were a couple of 
times that I wanted to throw 
in the towel … But my team 
kept me grounded,” he said.
Drew’s 
project 
was 
received 
so 
well 
that 
it 
solidified 
additional 
funding, which will allow 
the organization to continue 
active 
development 
over 
the summer. His summer 
project 
will 
consist 
of 
building the social network 
of professional and aspiring 
creatives, striving to bridge 
the gap between access to 
resources and mentors.
With 
this 
amount 
of 
momentum, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
Creatives 
of 
Color 
has a bright and eventful 
future ahead. Future plans 
include creative workshops, 
collaborations, 
exhibitions 
and youth outreach. As the 
organization is still in its 
infancy, the possibilities are 
wide open, and Metcalf is 
ready to take them head-on.
“The cool thing about 
(this project) is that there’s 
so much room for creativity 
and innovation. There are so 
many things we can we can 
do with this organization, 
and the ideas keep coming. 
I’m interested to see what 
comes of it,” he said while 
smiling.
Anyone 
interested 
in 
getting 
involved 
with 
Creatives of Color can join 
their 
Maizepage

When standing up to white supremacy, every step matters

Every morning, I find myself 
walking to class listening to 
my favorite songs, watching 
squirrels as they finesse food 
from passersby and moving 
around white people walking 
in 
my 
direction 
on 
the 
sidewalks. Before I noticed 
this disturbing pattern of 
mine, I always thought that 
stepping out of the way for 
oncoming 
pedestrians 
was 
just the polite thing to do. 
However, I recently noticed 
that the oncoming traffic, 
specifically when the person 
was 
white, 
would 
never 
return the common courtesy 
of stepping to the side when 
I walked by. I began to ask 
myself questions and wonder 
if I was carrying out the same 
subconscious behavior with 
people of other races. So, I 
decided to experiment a bit. 
Whenever a person of color 
walked by, I made space — 
while carefully watching if 
they would do the same. I 
tried doing this with people 
of color in large groups, small 

groups and by themselves. 
Each occurrence led to the 
same outcome: mutual respect 
for sidewalk space. This data 
then led me to the belief that 
this was a natural behavior 
of only white people, notably 
among white women.
After 
coming 
to 
such 
conclusion, I decided to try 
something even riskier: not 
move at all when white people 
passed by. I thought perhaps 
the confidence of a large, 
stocky Black woman standing 
her ground would make a 
difference and would be a 
call for change. But hell, was 
I wrong. Instead of change, 
I got shoulder bumped and 
glared at, commonly followed 
by snarky remarks such as, 
“Watch where you’re going,” 
“Wow that was rude” or “I 
can’t believe she just did 
that.” Of them all, it was the 
repetitive comment of “I can’t 
believe she just did THAT.” 
Confused on what “that” was 
referring to. 
As 
I 
continued 
my 
investigation of this behavior, 
I became aware of some 
not-so-surprising history of 

racial tensions and practices 
of white supremacy. I was in 
Associate Professor Stephen 
Berrey’s 
American 
South 
course when he started the 
lecture by talking about the 
more blatant and explicit 
forms 
of 
Jim 
Crow 
and 
racial superiority. He then 
clicked on a slide informing 
the class about more subtle 
practices in Southern states. 
He went on to state that “the 
expectation that Black people 
would step off the sidewalk 
for approaching white people 
was a common custom across 
the South that had extended 
back into the days of slavery 
(in which enslaved people 
were expected to step off). 
The incident (that exemplifies 
this was) in Danville, Va., 
in 1883 during an election 
year in which many white 
people were alarmed over 
growing Black political power 
and fears that Black people 
considered 
themselves 
the 
social equal of white people 
— as evidenced by the refusal 
to perform expected roles.” 
And 
many 
decades 
later, 
during the Jim Crow era, 

Black people continued to 
step off the sidewalk when a 
white person were to walk in 
their direction. Otherwise as 
noted previously, if a Black 
person failed to do so, they 
were acting as defiant, uppity 
and downright disrespectful. 
Now 
it 
all 
makes 
sense. 
This 
demonstration 
of 
subservience during such a 
simple thing like walking on 
the sidewalk was not and is 
not my fault. Instead, it is 
deep-rooted racism and white 
supremacy 
among 
white 
people that led me to feel 
inferior, just as my ancestors 
felt during the Jim Crow era, 
and much earlier.
But wait — there’s more.
I didn’t just notice this flat-
out disrespect and sense of 
superiority on the University 
of Michigan’s campus.
I’ve experienced it in the 
halls of high schools, where 
younger 
white 
students 
would do the same thing. 
I’ve experienced it walking 
downtown Detroit, a place 
where many white people 
dramatically state that they 
are afraid to go, yet there they 
are, subtly enforcing white 
supremacy. I’ve experienced 
it in grocery stores, malls 
and just about anywhere you 
could think of.
But now, I don’t move. I 
don’t budge. I don’t care. I 
don’t care whose shoulder I 
bump into, whose avocado 
matcha smoothie I spill or 
whose day I ruin. Why? 
Because every day that this 
continues to happen to other 
students, 
especially 
Black 
students, the more embedded 
and unnoticed it becomes, 
and the further it goes. So 
now when you see me walking 
and I don’t move, do not think 
it is because I am just another 
stuck up Black girl with an 
attitude, know it’s because I’m 
sick and tired and a change is 
bound to come. One step at a 
time.

Combating the 
monolith: Part one

Asian/Pacific 
Islander 
American 
Heritage 
Month 
celebrations have begun, and 
while I am actively taking part 
in celebrating A/PIA history, I 
have also taken time to reflect 
on my engagement with the A/
PIA community on campus.
A/PIAs are often subject 
to narratives that paint us as 
a monolith — a homogeneous 
group 
of 
people 
from 
an 
arbitrarily 
drawn 
region 
of 
the world. These narratives 
constrain what we and those 
outside of our circles perceive as 
A/PIA, and they are — as I have 
increasingly come to realize — 
violently perpetuated not only 
by the forces of white supremacy 
but by our own communities.
The notion that all A/PIAs 
come from similar classes and 
cultural 
backgrounds 
paints 
all A/PIAs as holding equal 
privilege, entirely ignoring the 
ethnic hierarchies that exist not 
only in Asia, but in our Asian/
Pacific Islander communities 
in the diaspora. The forces of 
exclusion 
and 
elitism 
these 
dynamics create, however, go 
largely unacknowledged.
This 
is 
despite 
the 
fact 
acceptance in self-proclaimed 
A/PIA spaces on campus often 
necessitates assimilation into an 
upper-class, mono-racial/ethnic 
and East-Asian consciousness.
I have often felt the need to 
qualify my presence in these 
spaces 
with 
explanations 
regarding my bi-ethnicity or 
assertions that I am, in fact, 
just as entitled to the label of 
“A/PIA” as everyone else in the 
room.
It has been a lifetime of these 
qualifications that leads me to 
this; it is so crucial that we are 
able to confront the fact the 
monolith is not only an idea that 

is arbitrarily imposed on us, but 
also a rhetoric that defines who 
is recognized as a valid member 
of this community. I feel this 
every time I walk into an A/
PIA space where there is no 
one of my skin color, my openly 
bi-ethnic identity or my cultural 
background. I feel it every time 
we preach “unity” but fail to 
vocalize the ways in which 
intra-Asian/Pacific 
Islander 
imperialism has created tension 
between us. I feel it every 
time the notion of a unified, 
invincible A/PIA identity masks 
the realities of exclusion in our 
community.
Thus, 
“A/PIA 
Heritage 
Month: 
Combating 
the 
Monolith” begins today. This 
spotlight series will highlight 
A/PIAs who may not necessarily 
fall into the notion of what an 
A/PIA is or should be. Though 
this series will not paint a 
comprehensive picture of all A/
PIA narratives, I hope that this 
month we can begin scratching 
the surface of a community that 
harbors an immense diversity in 
culture and experience.
My reflection is not indicative 
of the thoughts, feelings or 
convictions 
of 
those 
who 
will come after me. They are 
simply my own. In this vein, 
the stories you will hear over 
the course of this month are 
not ones that should be viewed 
as 
representative 
of 
their 
respective 
identities. 
Rather, 
they are individual narratives 
that 
have 
developed 
and 
emerged from experiences just 
as vivid, intimate and whole as 
yours.
With that, I wish you all a 
happy A/PIA Heritage Month! 
Let us engage in the celebration 
of the rich cultures and identities 
that make up our community, 
and let us strive toward an ideal 
of unity that recognizes and 
celebrates our difference.

Visiting the Newseum: The present and future 

As a fourth grader, my 
afternoon 
routine 
was 
simple. After getting off the 
bus, I’d make myself some 
microwavable 
macaroni 
& 
cheese and settle in with 
a copy of The Detroit Free 
Press. I’d usually start with 
the sports section (no one 
knew the Pistons like I did) 
before moving on to the news 
section, film reviews and, 
finally, the comics. The day 
the Freep stopped delivering 
to my household was a dark 
one and I unconvincingly 
pleaded with my parents to 
pay for the new, much more 
expensive 
special 
delivery 
fee.
My love of the news didn’t 
stop as I grew older (even if 
daily newspaper deliveries 
did). In high school, I joined 
my school paper and fell 
in love with being on the 
other side of the business. 
While the readership was 
small, I relished the power 
of a platform and its ability 
to shape conversation. This 

led me to join The Michigan 
Daily where I found my way 
to Michigan in Color — the 
section of The Daily dedicated 
to uplifting voices of color.
However, as a member of 
MiC, my rosy view of the 
journalism industry began to 
dim. MiC was founded because 
The Daily lacked the voices of 
students of color, which led to 
the mischaracterization and 
oftentimes racist depictions 
of students of color. The 
founders of MiC felt they 
couldn’t 
trust 
journalists 
to properly convey the real 
experiences of people of color, 
so they created a section 
where we would write for 
ourselves.
Fast forward to a week 
ago. Since I first heard about 
the 
Newseum, 
I’ve 
been 
intrigued. The museum is 
intended as a testament to 
the 
First 
Amendment 
— 
freedom of the press, speech, 
religion and petition — and 
its importance to a thriving 
society. From my first steps 
into the building, I felt the 
weight 
and 
responsibility 
the 
press 
puts 
on 
itself. 

Famous 
quotes 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
First 
Amendment, and the press in 
particular, covered the walls 
while 
exhibits 
contained 
information and old news 
clips explaining the role of 
the press in the Civil Rights 
Movement, the Vietnam War 
and 
uncovering 
injustice 
around the world. Highlights 
included a timeline of front 
pages of newspapers from 
pivotal points in history and 
the sobering memorial to 
journalists murdered for their 
work in pursuing justice.
The 
Newseum 
is 
a 
glorification of the press. 
In these hallowed halls, the 
press is always on the right 
side of history — always there 
to stand up for the rights of the 
oppressed, always objective, 
always the hero. However, I 
take issue with this the lack 
of nuance, and honestly, the 
reality of the building. The 
Newseum ignored one of the 
tenets of good journalism: 
Always tell the whole story. 
For all the headlines the 
Newseum 
showcased 
that 
exalted 
the 
Civil 
Rights 

Movement, they missed the 
ones decrying its protesters as 
“troublemakers” or “rioters.” 
The Newseum can cherry-
pick the front pages for the 
ones that portray the press 
in a good light, but it doesn’t 
erase the harmful work that 
has occurred and continues to 
this day.
For its faults, I cannot 
entirely dislike the Newseum 
or the industry and values it so 
lovingly portrays. The press 
is a vital institution for a fair 
society and historically it has 
been a part of social change 
and progress. However, for 
all its virtues, members of the 
media must come to terms 
with the harm those same 
actions can cause. For all the 
Watergates 
and 
Pentagon 
Papers journalism unveils, 
it does not mitigate that the 
news industry was the main 
driver of associating Islam 
with terrorism.
As the “first rough draft 
of history,” the news often 
shapes 
what 
and 
how 
people think. When the only 
stories of people of color are 
negative, how will society 
react? When Black people 
who march are rioters but 
white people who march are 
protesters, what will society 
think? I want to be clear, 
this isn’t a critique of the 
Breitbarts of the world. This 
is a critique of the New York 
Times, 
Washington 
Posts, 
and Michigan Dailys — papers 
that strive for greatness but 
either ignorantly or willfully 
continue the marginalization 
of vulnerable populations. It’s 
easy to rest on the laurels of 
journalism’s success, but we 
cannot act like journalism is 
immune to the racism, sexism 
and bigotry that permeates 
society. 
The 
press 
often 
acts 
as 
an 
accountability 
measure 
for 
governments 
and corporations — it’s time 
we shined that spotlight on 
ourselves.

6C— Fall 2018 

Mental illness is something 
hardly talked about in our 
country. 
Though 
mental 
illnesses 
like 
depression, 
anxiety, and bipolar disorder 
are extremely common and 
are extremely pressing issues, 
for some reason, discussion 
of them always seems to get 
swept under the rug. Mental 
illness plays a role in as high as 
90 percent of suicides amongst 
some 
professionals, 
though 
this statistic is often times 
debated, there is no denying 
that mental health directly 
correlates to mortality rates. 
These studies are extremely 
concerning, considering the 
increasing suicide rates in our 
nation. Mental health should 
be something we are always 
talking about — we shouldn’t 
have to wait until the latest 
suicide, whether it be someone 
you know or a celebrity.
As little as mental health is 
talked about in America, it’s 
discussed even less among 
people of color. Having a 
mental illness is stigmatized 
in communities of color, as 
something that makes you 
weak, something you should 
be ashamed of and should 
not talk about. Even though 
the reality of the world is 
that a lot of times, people of 
color are more likely to have 
mental health issues, probably 
because 
the 
discrimination 
and oppression they face on 
a daily basis have adverse 
effects on their mentality. For 
example, 
African 
American 
adults are 20 percent more 
likely to experience mental 
health issues than the rest of 
the population.
One 
reason 
why 
mental 
illnesses are so prevalent in 

communities of color is that 
self-care, something that can 
really help to prevent mental 
issues, is seen as a luxury and 
not a necessity. In one of my 
classes during the school year 
that was made up solely of 
students of color, we discussed 
the 
stigmas 
associated 
with self-care options such 
as therapy or yoga. Many 
students recounted how in 
their 
communities, 
things 
like those were described as 
“things for white people,” or 
luxuries versus necessities to 
help your mental health. We 
also discussed how in all of 
our respective communities, 
things like therapy were seen 
as taboo and something not to 
be discussed and to be swept 
under the rug, that it was 
embarrassing to have an issue 
requiring 
professional 
help 
and if you did you just should 
not talk about it.
The 
lack 
of 
discussion 
about mental health leads to 
multiple issues, as it seriously 
invalidates 
the 
experiences 
of those who do have mental 
health 
problems. 
This 
is 
because it makes them feel as 
if there’s something seriously 
wrong with them or that 
they’re inferior to the rest of 
their community. In reality, 
multiple 
people 
in 
their 
community 
are 
struggling 
with the same issues but are 
uncomfortable with bringing it 
up because of the stigma. This 
adds to the stigma because no 
one talks about it, creating a 
cycle.
I 
know 
one 
of 
the 
subconscious reasons I have felt 
othered as a Nigerian woman 
and a Black woman is due to 
the fact that I have depression 
and anxiety. Having a mental 
illness is never discussed in 
the circles and communities 

I’m in, both of Black people, 
and of Nigerian people. People 
just always talked about how 
when you face struggles and 
have 
problems, 
you 
were 
supposed to toughen up and 
work through it, making it 
seem so simple. Like all of 
my problems could be solved 
with easy fixes and if I was 
having issues, I must be doing 
something wrong.
I know from talking to 
my parents and cousins that 
mental illnesses “aren’t really 
a thing” in Nigeria. There, 
nobody talks about them and 
they’re never diagnosed. I can 
only imagine what it would 
be like to live with a mental 
illness there. Someone who 
has depression would just be 
considered prone to periods 
of sad moods and someone 
who has anxiety would just be 
considered a big worrier. Your 
illness would stop being just 
an illness and would begin to 
define who you are.
This is something that really 
concerns me because people 
all over the world have mental 
illnesses and simply avoiding 
the conversation does not make 
them go away. In fact, it makes 
them get worse, as it prevents 
people 
from 
seeking 
and 
receiving the treatment they 
need. Additionally, it prevents 
people from prioritizing their 
mental health, even though 
it’s just as important as one’s 
physical health.
It’s really frightening to 
know how little people of color 
and people, in general, discuss 
mental health, even though it’s 
2018 and the negative effects 
of this lack of discussion are 
multiplying. I’m just hoping it 
won’t take too many more wake 
up calls for people to realize 
we need to do something and 
fix this.

An homage to 
freshman year 

Coming to college, everyone 
echoed a similar mantra: “Cherish 
every moment, you only have one 
freshman year.” In the weeks 
before I finally left for Ann Arbor, 
I was wrought with anxiety and 
apprehension 
by 
the 
thought 
of going to college and leaving 
everything I knew behind. After 
unpacking my dorm room and 
hugging my parents goodbye, I 
knew, very rationally, that I was 
turning a new page in my life. 
Adulting, growing up, maturing ― 
however you want to frame it ― I was 
heading down a new path in my life.
With two weeks of the school 
year remaining, I get a little choked 
up every time I think about leaving 
the University of Michigan, a place 
that has truly become my new 
home. Looking back at my first few 
weeks to my last, the contrast is 
humorous. I want to pay homage to 
the parts of my freshman year at the 
University that made it so special.
My first few weeks of class, I 
had to use the Google Maps app to 
get from building to building. Being 
both directionally challenged and in 
a whole new environment is quite 
possibly the worst combination. 
Sadly, Maps wasn’t able to lead me to 
shortcuts, no matter how advanced 
the newest update may appear.
First semester, I had to walk 
from South Quad Resident Hall to 
the School of Public Health three 
times a week. For those of you who 
are geographically savvy, this is 
typically a 15-minute walk, but for 
the first three weeks of classes, it 
took me almost exactly 20 minutes 
to get to class. Maps was like my 
baby blanket, and I was too scared to 
go in any other direction other than 
where Siri directed me. Eventually, 
when heading to class with a friend 
one day, she looked at me wildly 
when I told her I had never cut 
through the Diag. Like, literally, 
I had never walked through the 

Diag to get to class. Finally being 
able to understand the intersecting 
paths around the emblematic ‘M’ 
on the Diag was a life-changing 
experience.
One fundamental part of the 
University’s character is the people 
that you meet here. I know, not 
everyone is great; it’s not a perfect 
place. But coming to this school, I 
never could have fathomed what 
it was like to be surrounded by 
so many smart, passionate and 
engaging 
students. 
There’s 
a 
competitive spirit to the University 
that challenges each student to 
become the best they can be. And 
believe me, there were, are and will 
be so many times where I will sigh 
in frustration that I am the dumbest 
person on campus. But having 
the opportunity to learn in an 
academically rigorous environment 
surrounded by peers who foster 
ambition and achievement is an 
unparalleled experience. No matter 
how hard the classes may seem, 
your classmates, professors and the 
campus environment are teaching 
students to grow and achieve more 
than they have believed.
Another fundamental part is the 
school spirit and our glorious game 
days. To be completely transparent, 
I am not a football person, but I love 
U-M game days with all of my heart. 
There is something so incredible 
about 
thousands 
of 
students, 
dressed in maize and blue, singing 
“Hail to the Victors” and willing 
a win out of our team. Win or lose, 
there is always unprecedented pride 
toward our team and our school. 
The student body feels as one unit, 
united by the spirit of the University 
of Michigan.
To 
the 
future 
Wolverines: 
Don’t take your freshman year for 
granted. Of course, it will be hard, 
and the University won’t feel like 
home with the snap of your fingers. 
But hold tight to the little moments, 
cut through the Diag and sing “Hail 
to the Victors” like it’s the last game 
day of your senior year.

Environmental “slack-tivism” in 2018

It’s 2018 and this year we 
celebrated the 48th anniversary 
of Earth Day, a global day of 
recognition 
for 
environmental 
protection. It also marks day zero 
of the Environmental Protection 
Agency “strengthening” the quality 
of science it uses to write new 
environmental rules, a decision 
made by EPA Administrator Scott 
Pruitt. “Strengthening” in this 
case means narrowing the scope of 
science available to the EPA to only 
findings that are reproducible and 
authentic, which may potentially 
violate the EPA’s pledge to use the 
best available science.
Recently, I was reminded by 
a CNN push notification that the 
health of my environment, as 
well as the integrity of my right 
to take action, is deteriorating. 
I immediately felt there was no 
legitimate way for me to express my 
disdain for political decisions like 

this one. After reading, I interrupted 
my 
friend’s 
final-paper-writing 
trance so she could commiserate 
with me in anger about the article. 
“Wow,” she sighed, “you should 
share that article on Facebook.”
This is “slacktivism,” or the 
watered-down support for an issue 
that requires only the most minimal 
effort, such as expressing opinions 
on social media. This is how our 
generation takes action. Is it true 
that millennial Wolverines are 
lazily riding a ski lift up the activism 
mountain, while generations before 
us trekked and trudged to reach the 
top of it? It is possible we come off 
as [COPY: confusing, maybe should 
say “it is possible we appear to them 
to be”] the pre-cooked meals in 
the freezer section of Kroger that 
require minimal effort to enjoy – 
just two minutes of “labor.” We are 
to past generations of activists as 
EasyBib is to handwriting an APA-
style reference.
Activists across the world gather 
annually on Earth Day in an attempt 

to harness the power necessary to 
keep the passion alive and stand up 
against environmental injustice. But 
what classifies as standing up for the 
Earth? Standing up for the Earth in 
2018 is quite different than it was in 
1970, especially on the University 
of Michigan campus – but how 
different?
“Slacktivism” on our campus, 
unfortunately, casts a shadow on 
our school’s unparalleled legacy of 
student-driven action. In March 
1970, U-M students organized a 
four-day-long series of events that 
revolved around taking action 
toward 
bettering 
their 
dirty 
surroundings. 
This 
“teach-in” 
served as a precursor to the first 
Earth Day just one month later. 
Before 
1970, 
the 
environment 
was degrading nationwide; the 
Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so 
polluted that it ignited and Santa 
Barbara was suffering after a 
massive oil spill. Locally, the Huron 
River’s wildlife populations were 
dropping like flies because its flies 
were 
drinking 
poisoned 
water. 
The 1970 teach-in let 
students take action in a way 
that had never been done 
before. Young adults our age 
attended conferences hosted 
by politicians in an attempt 
to gain perspective on the 
issues. They enrolled in the 
brand new environmental 
law major and walked along 
the Huron River to protest 
its deterioration. They took 
sledgehammers to a vehicle 
in the Diag that was facing 
a “trial and execution” for 
its pollution crime. They 
visited a former Ann Arbor 
Coca-Cola bottling plant 
and dropped off thousands 
of cans that were, at the 
time, non-returnable. They 
then picked up that mess of 
cans with their own hands.
Our generation has a 
slightly different way of 
expressing disgust for the 
state of the environment 
and its policies, as shown 
by my friend’s suggestion to 

Facebook “share” the Pruitt article. 
We use our own two hands to type 
outraged, 
opinionated 
streams 
of consciousness onto Facebook, 
letting the world know our true 
opinions about who is responsible 
for polluting what, and how John 
Appleseed should be paying for its 
clean-up. We retweet digs at Pruitt 
that criticize his tactics, question 
his motives, and press for answers 
about the future of the EPA. 
However, we need to start doing the 
action ourselves — the criticizing, 
the questioning and the pressing for 
answers.
We’ve picked a bad time for 
action to shift to inaction, for 
correspondence with state senators 
to turn into retweets and Facebook 
shares. I say “bad time” because 
as a country, we exist in quite a 
tumultuous 
environment, 
both 
environmentally 
and 
politically. 
Just this past year, humans’ actions 
resulted in the inability to coexist 
with certain species and a climate 
disaster in Puerto Rico. The U.S. 
was one of the only countries to 
withdraw from the Paris agreement 
and remove itself from the pact to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Not to worry — if all feels hopeless 
and degradation seems inevitable, 
check 
out 
the 
University’s 
sustainability website, and explore 
the huge progress the University 
has made to better the Earth and 
work toward our 2025 campus 
goals. We’ve already succeeded in 
applying 40 percent less chemicals 
to the green of our campus, but we 
need to focus on recycling to reduce 
waste sent to landfills and walking 
or busing to class to reduce our 
carbon footprint.
April 22, 2018 has come and 
gone, sweeping like a whirlwind 
over our country and hitting Ann 
Arbor especially hard. The 48th 
anniversary of Earth Day should 
serve 
as 
our 
push-notification 
reminder to wake up and smell the 
roses, both figuratively and literally. 
We are now in the same position as 
the 1970 U-M undergraduates that 
spoke up for what they believed in 
and inspired a national movement.

Female athletics in 
sports media 

Just as ticket prices appear 
to impact the public’s opinion 
of women’s sports, so does the 
sports media. There is little to no 
coverage of women’s athletics and 
that leads to a lack of investment, 
interest and education on the 
part of the public. It becomes 
extremely difficult to generate 
support when the big influencers 
in sports media disregard any 
important events that happen 
in the female athletics world. In 
fact, the only time there is any 
significant coverage of women’s 
sporting events is during the 
Olympics and the World Cup.
This becomes more obvious 
during March Madness. The 
men’s and women’s tournaments 
run side by side, yet the men’s 
tournament receives all of the 
media attention. In fact, I cannot 
recall a single time during the 
tournaments when I turned on 
ESPN and they were talking 
about the women’s tournament. 
For example, Sister Jean and the 
Loyola men’s basketball team 
received an extreme amount 
of media attention and were 
constantly in the conversation 
while the Notre Dame women’s 
basketball team received no 
attention 
despite 
the 
fact 
that they beat the undefeated 
University of Connecticut team 
in the Final Four, and Arike 
Ogunbowale went on to hit a 
buzzer beater to win it all. Of 
course, the Loyola team and their 
chaplain deserved attention as 
they were a fantastic Cinderella 
story, but perhaps some of the 
time spent covering them could 
have been better spent on the 
women’s tournament.
Another 
issue 
that 
accompanies the lack of media 
coverage is that it becomes very 
difficult to find articles and 
news about women’s sports. 

Even if someone is interested 
in reading articles and news on 
female athletics it takes at least 
five to 10 minutes of digging to 
find something interesting or 
relevant. For example, women’s 
sports receive only 4 percent of 
all sports media coverage and big 
sources like SportsCenter only 
devoted 1 percent of their on-air 
time to women’s athletics. 
This lack of representation 
becomes a huge problem for 
young female athletes as well. 
With so little media coverage, 
young girls struggle to find role 
models in their various sports. It 
is important that young athletes 
have someone they can look up 
to and relate to who encourages 
them to keep going and proves 
to them they can accomplish big 
things. Because this is so absent 
for female athletes, it may make it 
harder for young girls to feel like 
it’s worth it to continue to pursue 
their athletic careers. This leads 
to a higher rate of young girls who 
stop playing sports and therefore 
lose the many benefits that come 
from playing a sport such as 
higher self-esteem, positive body 
image, and lower anxiety levels.
All sports were unpopular 
at one point or another. It all 
comes down to exposure and 
marketing. Once women’s sports 
are given more coverage and the 
public becomes more exposed 
to the women’s sports world, 
these sports will become more 
popular. When women’s sports 
become more popular, people 
will become more educated on 
the topic. When people become 
more educated on the topic, the 
ability to close the pay gap and 
other inequalities is no longer 
an impossible task, but rather a 
goal that can be accomplished. 
When sports media starts to 
devote more of its time to female 
athletes, the fight for equality 
will become far less difficult and 
burdensome.

The struggle for diversty in physics

For much of its history, physics 
has been dominated by white men. 
Most well-known constants and 
equations are named after them, 
and when someone says “physicist,” 
what usually comes to mind is 
a white man. The stereotype is 
deeply rooted in the homogenous 
history of academia, but as our 
country and institutions become 
more diverse, shouldn’t the world 
of physics follow?
Sadly, this has not been the case. 
According to the 2016 population 
estimates based on the 2010 
U.S. census, 17.8 percent of the 
population identifies as Hispanic 
or Latino and 13.3 percent of the 
population identifies as Black 
or African American. However, 
according to statistics from the 
American Institute of Physics, only 
about 3.9 percent of the bachelor’s 
degrees in physics were awarded 
to African Americans and only 7.6 
percent to Hispanics.
To better understand the issue, 
I interviewed Brian Beckford, a 
presidential postdoctoral fellow 
here at the University of Michigan, 
to learn more about his own 
experience as a physicist of color, 
and an active advocate for diversity 
in STEM. His research concerns 
nuclear and particle physics.
When 
Beckford 
started 
as 
an 
undergraduate 
at 
Florida 
International University, he was 
initially interested in philosophy. 
Eventually, 
philosophy 
became 
limited in the answers it could 
provide him for the types of 
questions he had about how the 
universe works, and Beckford 
decided to switch his major to 
physics.
FIU boasts one of the most 
diverse student bodies in the 
country, but Beckford still found 
himself an outsider after switching 
majors.
“My friends and I joked that 
I was the best Black student in 
physics because I was the only 
Black student in the physics 
department at the time,” Beckford 

said.
While 
Beckford 
notes 
the 
department was never actively 
discriminatory, 
the 
idea 
of 
promoting diversity was never 
talked about. It was not seen as a 
priority of the department at the 
time.
Due to the fact that the 
traditional social and professional 
spheres of physics have not always 
strived to be inclusive, those who 
have been left on the outskirts 
have managed by creating their 
own spaces in which they could 
feel welcome in a community. 
The National Society of Black 
Physicists was formed in 1977, and 
since its inception has worked 
toward improving the experiences 
of Black physicists. Each year, 
NSBP hosts a national conference 
celebrating accomplishments by 
Black physicists from every field of 
physics. Beckford first attended this 
conference early in his graduate 
studies and goes back each year as 
his schedule allows.
“My faculty advisor at FIU 
and really good friend to this day, 
Professor Joerg Reinhold, German 
by descent, directed me towards 
the NSBP conference,” Beckford 
said. “(The conference) gave me 
some hope that there is a chance, 
and there is a space for physicists 
of color. I realized there would be a 
place for me in the field.”
Though conferences such as the 
NSBP meeting are well advertised 
at 
historically 
Black 
colleges 
and universities, they are not as 
talked about at institutions that 
are historically white. Helping 
to increase awareness of these 
kinds of opportunities is one way 
institutions such as ours can create 
a more welcoming, supportive 
environment for people from all 
different backgrounds.
“This year I am trying to 
encourage the department that 
we can attend the conference as a 
source of recruiting a more diverse 
group of students into the graduate 
program,” Beckford said.
In addition to his work as a 
researcher, as the department’s 
diversity, equity and inclusion 

committee chair, Beckford devotes 
as much time as he can to finding 
new ways the department can be 
more inclusive by bringing his 
experience as a project manager 
for the American Physical Society 
Bridge Program.
Many of Beckford’s proposed 
changes and improvements are 
focused on the recruitment of 
graduate 
students, 
including 
short-term projects, such as the 
new recruitment brochure. It 
highlights the inclusive ideals of 
the department. It is small, but 
represents 
an 
important 
step 
toward 
much-needed 
change. 
Long-term projects are in the 
works, but will take more time, 
as they require more cooperation 
and 
coordination 
among 
the 
department before these changes 
are seen as necessary in order to 
create a stronger, more diverse 
physics program at the University.
I was also curious about what 
Beckford thought could be done 
to increase representation among 
undergraduate students.
“Stronger 
discussions 
of 
career 
opportunities 
after 
an 
undergrad degree would be a 
great way to bring more diversity 
into the undergrad program,” he 
said. “Particularly among first-
generation students and students 
of color, there is a feeling of a need 
to give back, not only to their 
community, but to their family that 
might be sacrificing a lot for them to 
be there.”
I agree with Beckford, and a 
physics degree is really what you 
make it. You can put it to use many 
different ways. You can work in 
industry, research the frontiers of 
science in academia, affect social 
change as a teacher or community 
leader and much more. This is what 
makes a physics degree so exciting.
Once a school succeeds in 
recruiting a diverse student base, 
the next challenge is retainment. 
According to the Office of the 
Registrar 2016 report, of the 
freshmen 
who 
came 
to 
the 
University in 2012, 14.1 percent 
of those from underrepresented 
minority groups have left the 

University without finishing a 
degree. When comparing this with 
the 8 percent from all other groups 
that have left without finishing 
a degree, one can see the lack of 
inclusion most certainly plays a 
role in the discrepancy. We must 
recognize we can make the campus 
and departments more welcoming 
for everyone.
“The hard part is we have to 
change people’s mindset, and that 
diversity and inclusion is important 
for science,” Beckford said. “It’s 
people who do the science, so it 
follows that if you want the best 
science, you get the best people 
from all groups, and not just one.”
Academia is not always known 
for its adaptability, and tradition 
still plays a major role in how 
institutions and departments run. 
It can be tough to get every decision 
maker on board, as not everyone 
believes that a change is needed at 
all. However, this way of thinking 
goes against what we are trying to 
do in science, which is to advance 
human thought and make new 
discoveries. So even though old 
styles of mentoring and teaching 
might have worked when there 
was one majority group, we need 
to make improvements on how we 
do things and take every new factor 
into account.
After 
my 
interview 
with 
Beckford, I began to think about 
how critical it is to be more inclusive 
in the sciences. I feel it is especially 
important in today’s political and 
social climate to ensure that science 
is a beacon of inclusivity, of higher 
thinking and unlimited possibility, 
where all are welcome to create, 
discover and succeed.
At the end of our talk, Beckford 
asked, “How many great ideas were 
lost to fear, hate, and intolerance?” 
Too many to count, I would 
imagine. As we are those who strive 
towards higher understanding, we 
must never let untapped potential 
be wasted because of the fear of 
change or the lack of willingness 
to allocate resources and time to 
undertake the challenge. We can 
spark this change, right here, right 
now, at the University.

We have a glitter 
shortage 

You know that episode of 
“Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse” 
where Malibu has a glitter shortage 
and all hell breaks loose because 
Barbie is supposed to attend a 
Hollywood premiere that night and 
she doesn’t want her fans to see her 
without any glitter? I feel like that’s 
a pretty accurate depiction of how 
my summer’s gone so far. 
My “dreamhouse” is a little 
apartment on Central Campus, and 
toward the end of the school year, 
my roommates and I began to allow 
ourselves to consider the prospect 
of summer. Summer. The word 
itself drips with glitter and lake 
days and late nights. We all have 
jobs and internships, of course, but 
we’re used to being at the library 
until the early hours of the morning 
every single day. When you can’t 
remember the last time you got 
seven hours of sleep without feeling 
guilty about it, the idea of having 
nights and evenings completely 
void of homework sounds like 
something out of a fairytale.
But now summer’s here. We’re 
almost two months in, actually. And 
though our shoulders are tanner 
and our living room is packed to 
the brim with box fans we bought 
from CVS, it doesn’t really feel like 
summer. Day-to-day life doesn’t live 
up to the anticipation that the word 
“summer” carries.
Why? My theory is that the 
University of Michigan has a glitter 
shortage.
The first time I was finally 
allowed to wear makeup to school, 
I covered my eyelids with silver 
glitter, just like I’d practiced so 
many times before. Other than 
math class, when a boy told me I 
looked like I was on crack, I felt 
glamorous all day. I wasn’t just 
another gangling, awkward middle 
schooler. I had created art on my 
face that showed I was a stylish, 
dazzling it-girl.

I’m 20 years old now, and my 
mom really doesn’t get much say 
as to what I’m allowed to wear 
anymore. I live on my own, so I call 
the shots. What do I wear now that I 
have no parental supervision?
Well, last night, one of my 
roommates had some friends over 
and we all got dressed up for a night 
out. I sat cross-legged in front of the 
full-length mirror in my bedroom 
and listened to my roommates 
laughing and singing as I put on my 
makeup. Foundation. Concealer. 
Blush. 
Eyebrow 
gel. 
Black 
eyeshadow to create the illusion of 
longer lashes. Thick, dark mascara 
that my mom got me for Christmas. 
No glitter. Not even a drop.
During our walk down South 
University Avenue on the way home 
after our glitterless night out, my 
roommate, Shannon, and I asked 
ourselves why it doesn’t feel like 
summer yet.
“It feels like we’re just waiting 
for summer to start,” she said. “Like 
it’s going to be fun and exciting and 
full of adventure, but it just hasn’t 
happened yet.”
“I think we’re still trying to 
figure out who we are beyond 
homework,” I said. “’Cause during 
the school year, all we did was study 
and go to class and we never had to 
figure out who we were and what 
we wanted to do. And now that we 
have the time to do that, we’re just 
lost.”
Before we started spending 
every spare moment in the library, 
we all used to daydream about 
being glitzy and glamorous. Where 
did those big dreams go? When did 
we become so boring?
It doesn’t feel like summer yet 
because, yep, I’m glitter-deficient. 
That’s bad news. The good news? 
You can buy glitter eyeshadow on 
Amazon for $3. Anyone want me to 
order some for you?
Someone tell Barbie that Malibu’s 
glitter deficiency has nothing on the 
University of Michigan.

Rice-krispies induced nostalgia

I once roamed the basement 
of 
North 
Quad 
Residence 
Hall during a study break to 
search for a quick and filling 
vending machine snack. As 
I 
approached 
the 
machine 
hoping I wouldn’t be forced to 
settle for a bag of chips that 
was 75 percent air, I noticed a 
blue rectangular surprise in 
the left corner: a Rice Krispies 
treat. At only 160 calories, it 
proudly wore the MHealthy 
sticker on its front. I went for 
it without hesitation. Peeling 
back the wrapper, I exposed 
what I had been missing for so 
many years. The first bite was 
crispy, chewy and soft — just 
the way I remembered it. It 
transported me to a decade in 
the past, to the kitchen table 
of my childhood home where 
my mom taught me how to 
make these delicacies from 
scratch. It was the first recipe 
I committed to memory, and 
though it resulted in a messy 
cleanup, it became one of my 
favorite bonding experiences 
with my mother. But I didn’t 

realize how long it had been 
since I had enjoyed Kellogg’s 
greatest invention (sorry Nutri-
Grain bars, it was a close call). I 
felt nostalgic immediately after 
that first bite, and it prompted 
me to clear the CVS shelves of 
their Rice Krispies inventory 
on my way home.
For some of us, it’s Rice 
Krispies treats. For others, it’s 
Smucker’s PB&J Uncrustables, 
Fruit Gushers or maybe even a 
traditional home-cooked meal. 
No matter the treat, many 
of us have strong emotional 
connections and memories tied 
to foods that have us longing for 
a simpler past. It’s a powerful, 
food-induced nostalgia. The 
etymology 
of 
“nostalgia” 
is 
complex, 
but 
today 
we 
understand it to be a yearning 
for yesterday. It allows us to 
travel back to specific times 
in our lives and sometimes 
even relive old feelings and 
emotions — like the way I felt 
in my mom’s kitchen all those 
years ago. By evoking these 
feelings and emotions, food 
acts as a medium for childhood 
recollections. But what is it 
about food that makes it so 

powerful? Why does eating 
certain foods resurface some of 
our most treasured memories?
The answer may be that 
food 
consumption 
involves 
memory-inducing cues that are 
extremely evocative, such as 
scents, tastes and textures. The 
general experience of eating 
is also significant to memory 
creation and collection as it 
is oftentimes tied to social 
activities 
and 
exchange 
which attaches a new layer of 
sentimentality to our favorite 
foods. The act of eating can 
definitely be private, but we all 
remember sharing food over 
the holidays with our loved 
ones and during the most social 
parts of our young lives, such 
as school lunches and summer 
camps. Those images suddenly 
come back when we revisit 
our favorite foods. And, from 
a more biological perspective, 
our brains are wired to form 
memories about what we eat. 
The part of our brain called 
the hippocampus, which is 
essential to the formation of 
long-term memories, is also 
home to receptors of hormones 
that 
regulate 
appetite, 

digestion and eating behavior.
Perceptions 
surrounding 
nostalgia are usually negative, 
portraying those caught in 
nostalgia as stuck in the past. 
But some studies challenge 
these perceptions and suggest 
that nostalgia can actually be 
beneficial. In fact, evoking 
feelings from the past can 
help 
buffer 
people 
from 
experiencing 
loneliness. 
Comfort food that reminds 
us of previous social ties can 
help deter feelings of isolation. 
Additionally, some researchers 
argue 
nostalgia 
contributes 
to feeling safe because foods 
that we’ve already consumed 
in the past can be associated 
with positive memories, which 
reduces risk-taking. If this 
is the case, it seems wise for 
food brands to play into this 
“positive nostalgia” in their 
advertisement techniques.
In 
2017, 
Post 
Consumer 
Brands did just that by bringing 
Oreo O’s back into our lives. 
After a 10-year absence, the 
iconic 
cereal 
reminded 
us 
young adults of what it was like 
to eat cookies for breakfast. 
I remember walking through 
the cereal aisle at Kroger 
and 
reading, 
“the 
highly 
anticipated sweet return” on 
the front of the box, and though 
the cereal hadn’t crossed my 
mind for years, I was suddenly 
convinced 
the 
comeback 
was well overdue. While my 
matured 
palate 
no 
longer 
appreciates the grainy feeling 
that lingers after eating sugary 
cereal, it was definitely worth 
giving Oreo O’s another go.
We’ve grown out of our 
childhood habits to become 
hardworking college students. 
But that shouldn’t stop us from 
indulging in sugary snacks from 
time to time. Sometimes, all it 
takes is a Rice Krispies treat 
to send us back to our favorite 
moments. 
And 
thankfully, 
science supports our endeavors 
to reconnect with our past.

The University of Michigan has 
an Adderall problem. Some would 
even call it an epidemic. Despite the 
University’s increased campaign 
to recognize mental health on 
campus, it has failed to address 
how campus culture fosters the 
use of Adderall throughout the 
school. As students become more 
entrenched in the popular “work 
hard, play hard” mentality that 
grips much of the student body, 
they turn to Adderall to achieve the 
academic and social success that 
this campus covets. A recent survey 
by The Daily found that 24 percent 
of University students use Adderall, 
and a 2008 study of 1,800 students 
found that as much as 81 percent of 
college students think that Adderall 
usage is not dangerous at all or 
only slightly dangerous, despite 
the fact that the consequences of 
the illicit use of the drug sit right 
next to those of cocaine, meth and 
morphine. However, despite the 
prevalence of the drug, there is a 
dearth of University resources to 
educate or help students that are 
grappling with its repercussions.
To remedy this gap in 
resources, the University must 
increase funding for Counseling 
and Psychological Services and 
advertise services provided by 
Addiction Treatment Services 
through Michigan Medicine. Over 
90 percent of students who use 
Adderall use it for the purpose 
of concentrating while studying. 
These students do not realize 
the potential negative effects of 
the drug: notably, its high risk of 
dependency and potentially lethal 
consequences if used with other 
drugs and alcohol. With such a 
large percentage of students using 
Adderall without a prescription, 
it is important that the University 
provides students with addiction 
help.
The presence of Adderall at the 
University is almost expected. 
Whether prescribed or non-
prescribed, Adderall is a normalized 
part of campus culture; people try 
it, use it and depend on it. Though 
freshmen entrance programs like 
Haven or AlcoholEdu exist to 
raise awareness on the dangers of 

alcohol consumption and addiction, 
there is no campus-wide campaign 
that addresses the overwhelming 
prevalence of Adderall at the 
University. Consequently, most 
students don’t know much about 
the drug, and view it through a 
destigmatized, distorted lens. 
Because it is considered customary 
and is easy to acquire, most students 
don’t realize the medical, legal and 
moral implications of taking or 
selling the drug.
Adderall is classified as a 
Schedule II drug by the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, 
which means that it maintains 
a “high potential for abuse, 
with use potentially leading to 
severe psychological or physical 
dependence.” It ranks higher than 
drugs like Xanax, which is Schedule 
IV, and is at an equal level with 
cocaine, another Schedule II drug. 
In addition to its addiction level, 
Adderall can spur painful side 
effects, from insomnia to paranoia. 
In an interview with the Daily, one 
student reported that “if I took it at 
any acute dose, it would just kind 
of cause chest discomfort and keep 
me from sleeping, and I couldn’t get 
anything done because the chest 
pain would make me panic.” 
Along with medical issues, 
Adderall dealing and use can lead 
to harsh legal consequences. The 
length and weight of penalties vary, 
but according to Michigan law, 
distribution of Adderall illegally is 
considered a felony and can lead 
to serious jail time. Despite this, 
Adderall dealing doesn’t have 
the same image as other drug 
trafficking. On campus, it’s as easy 
as texting someone in your hall for 
a pill or two. There are no back-
alley deals, and oftentimes, money 
isn’t even involved. Because it is 
destigmatized and bred from an 
intense, competitive school culture, 
giving someone Adderall may 
appear to be helpful, not harmful. 
To some, the need to succeed 
outweighs the legal risks. Another 
student interviewed by The Daily 
reflected on her Adderall use by 
saying “I never really thought 
about it as being illegal to be honest 
… I feel like a lot of people who 
don’t have ADD (Attention-deficit 
disorder) are prescribed Adderall 
and I don’t think it’s like taking 

a Prozac or something that is so 
mentally altering … I don’t think of 
it as, ‘Oh, this is like a drug.’” Many 
students at the University echo 
this mentality subliminally, and by 
forgetting the legal implications of 
selling Adderall, we only add to its 
normalization on campus.
The perception of Adderall tends 
to lack the severity that we ascribe 
to other performance-enhancing 
drugs. Adderall has proven to 
improve students’ performance 
in rote memory forms of learning 
tasks, especially over several days 
or longer, acting as a performance 
enhancer for exams and tests that 
require intensive memorization. 
This can be especially impactful 
in classes in which performance 
relies on rote learning. When 
the difference in letter grade 
is significantly changed by the 
number of concentrated hours one’s 
mind can dedicate to memorizing 
in relation to others in their class, 
Adderall acts as a medically induced 
upper hand. 

The widespread and 
academically motivated use of 
Adderall on campus can make it 
easy to forget what exactly it is: a 
drug. Much like other drugs aimed 
at enhancing abilities, whether 
mental or physical, Adderall 
presents its users with a moral 
choice. Adderall’s aid of certain 
academic abilities is one of its 
innate qualities, and students at 
the University should recognize 
as much. For those who view this 
issue as inconsequential, this 
much should be remembered: All 
students, Adderall users or not, play 
on the same academic field. Thus, 
we all feel the tilt brought about by 
Adderall, whether it pushes us up 
or down.
Though Adderall is commonly 
used in academic settings, it is also 
prevalent in the college party scene 
as a complement to alcohol. The 
focus of the University’s efforts 
to curtail dangerous behavior 
has been mostly targeted toward 
alcohol. However, the recent 

increase of mixing the “study 
drug” with alcohol should provoke 
concern because of the possibility 
of dangerous and unpredictable 
effects.
First of all, the University should 
take care to educate students on 
the chemical differences between 
Adderall and alcohol. Adderall, 
on the one hand, is a powerful 
central nervous system stimulant 
that increases the availability of 
excitatory neurotransmitters in 
areas of the brain that deal with 
focus, energy and alertness. On 
the other hand, alcohol is a central 
nervous system depressant that 
inhibits the function of excitatory 
neurotransmitters. 
The mixing of Adderall and 
alcohol then has two discernible 
effects: those in the short term and 
in the long term. The short-term 
effects stem from the unpredictable 
nature of their combination. One 
minute someone could be within 
their limit of alcohol intake, and 
the next they could be suffering 

from seizures or heart failure as 
a result of the capricious cocktail 
of medication plus alcohol. In 
the long term, a person’s quality 
of life can suffer from mixed 
use. A recent study found that 
simultaneous use of non-medical 
prescription stimulants and alcohol 
by undergraduates was associated 
with low grade point averages, use 
of other substances and increased 
alcohol-related consequences.
The group at the highest risk for 
Adderall abuse is college students, 
and therefore the University has 
an obligation to educate its student 
population on the consequences. 
The consumption of Adderall is 
not only widespread, but students 
have also become desensitized to 
its possible severity. To counteract 
this trend, a possible addition to the 
AlcoholEdu program of a freshman 
seminar on the use of unprescribed 
medication in academic and 
recreational settings could be a 
positive step forward for student 
safety and security.

Let’s talk about Adderall

A letter to my 
freshman self

Graduating 
high 
school, 
I 
thought college would be a simple 
continuation of what I had been 
doing, but, you know, different. 
That wasn’t right at all; well, for 
the most part, anyways. My first 
semester was through the Summer 
Bridge Scholars Program and in a 
way it was like high school. We had 
predetermined classes at set times 
and we all got to know each other 
pretty well. Classes started at 8:30 
every morning and there were two 
lunch periods. Kind of like high 
school but, you know, different.
As I conclude my second year 
at the University of Michigan, I 
would like to reflect back on my 
time here, what has led me up to 
this point and what I wish I had 
done differently. If I could write 
a letter to my high school self, 
reminiscing on how I screwed 
up or the times I didn’t know any 
better, it would probably start 
with something along the lines of 
“Dear Me, you have no clue what 
you’re getting into,” or maybe more 
like “Dear Dumbass, please try 
harder.” After that first summer, 
I was overconfident, unprepared 
and just straight-up not ready for 
college.
Flash forward to fall semester 
freshman year and I actually had 
to pick my own classes (which 
I had never done before) and 
basically decide what I wanted 
to do with the rest of my life. 
Ambitious as ever, I signed up 
for the earliest class times and, as 
a hopeful Engineering transfer, 
thought it would be a splendid idea 
to take all the core classes at once 
(Engineering 100, Chemistry and 
Calculus). To top it off, I also took 
the LSA language requirement as I 
was still an LSA student. 
I wish someone would have 
given me a reality check about 
what college was really like. Being 
a first-generation student, I wasn’t 
able to consult my parents in 

regard to how I was supposed to 
go about the whole college thing.In 
high school, I never thought very 
highly of those who dropped out 
of college, but I wish I had taken 
the time to ask why they did. After 
that fall semester I was seriously 
considering taking some time off 
myself. College sucked, man.
I have now been able to settle 
into college and I feel much more 
confident in my ability to manage 
the work involved, but if it hadn’t 
been for the high expectations of 
my family and friends, I might be 
flipping burgers for a living right 
now. I thought I was alone in my 
situation, but I later found out 
that this was not the case. In fact, 
according to the First Generation 
Foundation, 
“Nationally, 
89 
percent 
of 
low-income 
first-
generation students leave college 
within six years without a degree” 
and, “More than a quarter leave 
after their first year.”
If I could write a letter to myself, 
knowing what I know now, it 
would probably look something 
like this:
Dear idiot, dumbass me,
First and foremost, you are done 
with high school. It’s over. Please 
don’t go out partying if you have 
homework to do. Yes, even if it’s 
the weekend and all your friends 
are going. Stop procrastinating 
and do not prioritize a social life 
over school because you are really 
going to kill my GPA, dude. Second, 
please take a more manageable 
course load, especially in your 
first semester, because you will 
have me considering dropping out, 
for goodness sake. And last, but 
definitely not least, sit down and 
take some time to think about your 
future. Plan out what classes you 
need to take and how you are going 
to go about taking them. Talk to an 
advisor if you need to (just do it, 
man) — they are way smarter than 
you. Oh, and that schedule thing 
that you thought you were too 
good for? Well use it, idiot: it’s so 
much more helpful than you know.

Confessions of a closeted rosshole

It really is a daunting task, 
deciding your career path at the 
ripe old age of 18. It has been 
over a year since I found out I 
was accepted into the University 
of Michigan as well as the Ross 
School of Business. At the time, 
I remember thinking everyone 
knew what they were going to 
study in the fall. Little did I know, 
that many people will change their 
minds at least once, if not twice, in 
college. With so much excitement 
joining the U-M community, I 
didn’t realize it came with a whole 
new platform for college memes. 
The punchline for a lot of these 
jokes, however, involves business 
majors or – as we’re known on 
campus – Rossholes.
I’m what you might refer to as 
a “closeted” Rosshole. I applied 
to the Business School without 
any rhyme or reason and, to 
my surprise, was accepted. I 

remember being ecstatic until 
I realized the reputation that 
being in Ross carries on this 
campus. STEM majors scoff at 
you and you can’t exactly bond 
with other non-STEM majors 
because, you know, capitalism. As 
a freshman with absolutely no idea 
what the stock market is and an 
inability to pretend I understood 
how Wall Street worked, this was 
particularly confusing to me. What 
exactly is the stigma surrounding 
the B.B.A.? What exactly made me 
a “Rosshole?” 
Honestly, to truly define what 
campus deems a Rosshole, you have 
to go to the meme pages. There, you 
can find the meaning of Rosshole 
clear as day. First, you have to be 
someone who incessantly talks 
about the fact that they’re in the 
Business School. Then, obviously, 
comes the Canada Goose jackets. 
Can’t be a true Rosshole without it. 
The overall effect is just a stuck-up 
person who will end up with some 
kind of fancy internship – that they 

may or may not deserve – doing 
something they don’t particularly 
understand that will eventually get 
them a lot of money. Kind of mind-
boggling, no?
I can totally see why the rest 
of the school hates business 
students so much. The building 
itself 
screams 
Rosshole 
with 
its namesake, Stephen M. Ross, 
donating 
millions 
of 
dollars 
to enhance the already-garish 
façade on East University Avenue. 
Meanwhile, across campus, other 
departments may be struggling to 
find funding. It is infuriating. It is, 
wait for it, capitalism.
With this mindset, I entered 
freshman 
year 
unwilling 
to 
divulge the fact that I was in the 
Business School, which, let me 
tell you, was very difficult. The 
first two questions you get when 
meeting someone new anywhere 
on this campus is, “What are you 
studying?” and, as a freshman, 
“Where are you living?” Both 
of these questions posed issues 
because I was in the 
Business 
School 
and 
living 
in 
Martha 
Cook. Both of these 
answers 
can 
garner 
very 
negative, 
albeit 
interesting responses. I 
learned how to explain 
away the funny looks I 
got when I said I lived in 
the all-girls dorm with 
a severe reputation by 
mentioning it’s actually 
a really nice place to 
live, but that’s another 
story for another time. 
How did I deal with 
answering the major 
question? I had a couple 
of solutions, both of 
which 
were 
equally 
annoying and equally 
harder to deal with than 
if I had just said I was 
in the Business School. 
I learned if I asked the 
question first – bam – I 
could tailor my answer 
to whatever they said: 
“Oh, you’re in Ross? 
Me too!” or “Not in 

Ross? Okay then, I am in LSA and 
undecided.”
The whole “LSA and undecided” 
answer worked really well until 
I went to go fill out forms or 
people started to get more curious 
about my class schedule. The 
Business School isn’t part of LSA 
and business students are not 
undecided because they receive 
a B.B.A. Super specific, I know. 
Anyways, I would forget about the 
whole B.B.A. thing because I was 
so determined to ignore the fact 
that I was in the Business School. 
I’ll admit it, I was ashamed.
The first five months of the 
school year, a long time for a school 
that gets out in April, were awful. I 
treaded lightly when I met people, 
not knowing whether or not being 
a business student would somehow 
affect our possible friendship. 
Spoiler alert: it didn’t. I put so 
much emphasis on the negative 
aspect of the fact that I was in Ross 
that I didn’t look at the bright side. 
I’m in Ross. Some people would kill 
to be in my position.
I didn’t appreciate that until 
the middle of winter term. I 
think it had to do with the fact 
that I was in denial about not 
being a STEM major. The people 
with which I surround myself 
are all pre-med or some kind 
of biochemical science major 
taking organic chemistry their 
first year while I sat around 
doing ethics case studies. Both 
are super interesting, it’s just 
that, for a long time, I didn’t 
understand the weight of what 
I was studying, didn’t think it 
was as “academic” as, say, doing a 
chemistry lab.
I think one of the biggest 
reasons I didn’t feel comfortable 
with my standing in the Business 
School was that I have no idea 
what I want to do with my life. 
Do I want to go into health-care? 
Do I want to manage a hedge 
fund? Do I want to somehow do 
both? These questions continue to 
plague me, but a business degree 
is at least start in some kind of 
direction. So, yeah, maybe I am a 
Rosshole after all.

A conversation with Bo Burnham on his film debut

A24

I lingered in the Michigan 
Theater’s main auditorium last 
Thursday after the screening of 
Bo Burnham’s directorial debut, 
“Eighth 
Grade.” 
A 
crowd 
of 
teenagers, young adults and retirees 
had just finished giving Burnham a 
standing ovation after his short Q&A 
and were now streaming out the 
back of the theater while I fought to 
make my way to the front. Not a seat 
in the theater had been empty that 
night. The movie, which marked 
the beginning of the Cinetopia Film 
Festival, had sold out earlier that day 
— and for good reason. 
“Eighth Grade” is a continuation 
of movies like “Lady Bird” and “Call 
Me By Your Name.” While they’re 
not all explicitly similar in genre 
or plot, they evoke a similar feeling 
from their audiences — something 
like nostalgia, but not quite, and like 
nervousness, but more trepid. These 
films zero in on the familiar and 
universal experiences of growing up 
and falling in love, while skillfully 
retaining 
the 
autonomy 
and 
individuality of their characters.
“Lady Bird” and “CMBYN” 
fit nicely into the coming-of-age 
category of films, but “Eighth Grade” 
narrowly avoids this label. While 
the movie introduces an expectedly 
coming-of-age abstract — Kayla 
(Elsie Fisher, “Despicable Me”) 
is a shy middle schooler entering 
her last week of eighth grade who 
decides to put herself out there 
before the school year ends — the 
entire movie is undercut by larger 
anxieties concerning technology, 
social media and problems beyond 
Kayla’s impending high school 
career.

Burnham, who got his start in 
comedy by making Youtube videos 
filmed in his childhood bedroom, 
has always had these concerns 
on his mind. Much of his standup 
challenges our expectations of 
technology and tries to illustrate 
the 
complex 
relationship 
our 
generation has with it. “I’m addicted 
to the internet too,” Burnham 
conceded during the Q&A after the 
screening, but that doesn’t mean he 
still doesn’t share the anxieties we 
all do, especially when looking at 
the effect it could have on younger 
generations.
“There 
is 
a 
much 
subtler 
conversation to be had about 
the internet beyond Russia and 
cyberbullying, 
something 
very 
personal and interior to the internet 
and what it does to people that is not 
okay,” said Burnham earlier that 
night in response to an audience 
member’s 
question 
about 
this 
aspect of the film. “There’s this 
sudden impulse to see yourself as a 
commodity or a character. To sort of 
float above your life and watch other 
people watch you and watch other 
people watch you watch them.”
Much 
of 
“Eighth 
Grade” 
concerns this kind of watching. 
Kayla aimlessly scrolls through her 
Instagram feed, liking pictures and 
videos of other 13 year olds pulling 
pranks and painting their nails. She 
makes videos with survival guide 
tips on how to be more confident, 
while suffering from crippling 
shyness in her day-to-day life. She 
wants to be seen as someone she’s 
not, an expert on relationships 
and “Being Yourself.” Access to 
Instagram and Youtube makes 
this very easy for her to do. Kayla’s 
the eighth grader most of us were: 
Awkward and introverted with 

acne-prone skin. But unlike us, she 
can hide this under Snapchat filters 
and good lighting.
Making my way to the front of the 
Michigan Theater under the massive 
chandelier, 
swarms 
of 
people 
moving in the opposite direction 
of me stared. I found Burnham’s 
representative, who I was directed 
to in an email, and taken backstage 
to wait for him to finish up another 
interview. As I waited, no matter 
who I talked to, be it Ella, the A24 
publicist traveling with Burnham 
on the tour or a 68-year-old male 
Michigan 
Theater 
employee, 
everyone’s reactions stuck on the 
same point: The universality of a 
13-year-old girl’s last week of middle 
school and her efforts to woo the 
cool kids in school.
“What’s the score?” Burnham 
asked Ella as we walked down 
the narrow hallway towards the 
dressing room. He was referring 
to the Cavs and Warriors game 
taking place that night, and I was 
immediately worried I would have 
to make small talk about basketball, 
a subject far from my specialty. But 
Burnham 
barely 
acknowledged 
this pause before sitting down next 
to me. He had been answering 
questions all day; it was 10:45 p.m. 
and he admittedly looked tired.
A question many people have 
fixated on in relation to “Eighth 
Grade” is how Burnham managed 
to perfectly capture the experiences 
of a 13-year-old girl without basing it 
off himself or someone else. Multiple 
years of touring has exposed him 
to the age demographic he was 
trying to paint a picture of but, as 
he pointed out, anything we need to 
know about middle schoolers these 
days is right at our fingertips. They 
put everything online to be seen.

“I think it would’ve been different 
if it had been sort of polluted by like 
‘Oh this is my little cousin or my 
friend’s sister,’” Burnham responded 
when I asked how he managed to 
draw such a perfect portrait. “When 
I was writing it, it felt like someone 
I knew, but it wasn’t specific.” This 
is how he avoided the nostalgia trap 
this film could’ve easily become. He 
was chasing a feeling, not nonfiction.
“I just wanted to do an intense 
movie about being this person, not 
what it means to be a kid always 
throughout all of time. I was 
feeling very nervous and panicked 
and anxious on the internet, and 
I was looking at the internet and 
meeting people, and I saw all these 
people also feeling very nervous 
and panicked in their lives too. So 
I wanted to explore what it felt like 
to feel anxious, to feel …” Burnham 
paused here, thinking. “Anxious 
is the opposite of nostalgic. It’s the 
opposite of distance at least. You’re 
locked in it and you can’t really 
see outside of yourself. So it was 
important that the movie didn’t 
see outside of her. I didn’t want the 
movie to know any more than she 
did.”
It’s terrifying to think that 
the common thread from one 
generation to the next is anxiety, but 
the internet undeniably doles out 
this feeling of uneasiness from one 
user to the next. And all the details of 
the film lend themselves to creating 
this feeling of uneasiness, but also 
the feeling that we are in Kayla’s 
world where every look, word and 
wink is a life or death situation. 
The audience truly doesn’t see 
outside of Kayla as Anne Meredith’s 
EDM score ropes us into the film, 
dropping a hard-hitting bass drop 
when Fisher’s character sees her 

crush for the first time or confronts 
the mean girl in school.
As far as influences go, Burnham 
didn’t have any but the faces he’s 
come across in life and online. But 
there’s something to be said about 
how the experience of 27-year-old 
Burnham can be easily translated 
to 13-year-old Kayla or 20-year-old 
me. Why did he think that is the 
case? I wondered, and then I asked, 
“What do you think it is about the 
internet that allows you to write 
convincingly from the point of view 
of a 13-year-old and not have the 
audience bat an eye?”
“I think the culture at the 
moment is existing on an eighth-
grade level, you know what I mean?” 
Burnham replied. “The national 
conversation is taking place at an 
eighth-grade level, our president 
has like an eighth-grade reading 
level. So it just feels very true to me. 
I think the internet makes eighth 
graders of us all.”
What struck me about this 
conversation with Burnham, and 
replies like these, was the concern 
and anxiety seeping into his voice 
as he talked about these topics, 
and how starkly it contrasts from 
the Burnham confined to Netflix 
specials and computer screens. 
While his standup drips with vitriol 
and is known for its dramatic flare, 
this movie is entirely different. It’s 
smart and clever and honest, tackles 
similar subject matters as “what.” 
and “Make Happy,” but isn’t the 
least bit arrogant or pretentious.
As Burnham put it, this movie 
is truer to who he is. “I am not 
naturally 
that 
pyrotechnic, 
overridden, cynical thing. It’s what 
the medium called for … and the 
truth was I was onstage terrified 
every night.” Making the move 

from irony to sincerity for Burnham 
was “freeing.” “It was natural. It 
felt more like dropping things like 
finally I can drop all these tools. I’m 
so excited to finally do something 
that isn’t ironic, isn’t satirical.”
When we’re children, we just 
want adults to recognize the 
magnitude of our situation. “Eighth 
Grade” captures the life and death 
feeling attached to being 13 years 
old. Between the music, Elsie 
Fisher’s 
fantastic 
performance 
and Burnham’s attention to the 
most minute details, the audience 
was dragged into this feeling 
and left laughing, squirming and 
occasionally shielding their eyes, 
unable to stand the familiarity of it.
“I didn’t want to make a nostalgic 
movie,” Burnham said during the 
theater’s Q&A session. “I wanted to 
know about what it’s like to be young 
now. I watched hundreds of videos 
of kids online talking about their 
own life and the boys talked about 
minecraft, and the girls talked about 
their souls.”
I don’t think Burnham made a 
nostalgic movie. It’s difficult to feel 
nostalgic about such a confusing, 
anxious, hormonal time in one’s 
life. But he did make a reflective 
movie, an honest one. He made 
a movie that triggers feelings of 
anxiety and terror as we feel them 
in eighth grade and now on a larger 
scale. As Burnham put it, “Sweeping 
decisions about the future of our 
brain’s neurochemistry are being 
made by nine guys with no social 
skills in Silicon Valley.” And while 
being a girl in eighth grade is a 
common experience among many, 
these sweeping decisions make 
every generation’s experience in 
middle school more and more 
unknowable.

‘Tully’ explores modern motherhood with sincerity, boldness

What 
does 
modern 
motherhood 
look 
like? 
The 
spectrum 
of 
cinematic 
depictions of what it means to be 
a mother is seemingly endless, 
ranging 
from 
lighthearted, 
surface-level 
portrayals 
of 
mothers in “Freaky Friday” 
and “Mean Girls” to far darker 
depictions of mothers acting 
‘un-motherly’ in “Carrie” and 
“Ordinary People.” Despite the 
variation in genre, what all these 
films have in common is that 
their portrayals of motherhood 
are 
over-exaggerated 
and 
unrealistic. When it comes to 
interpreting motherhood, the 
film world turns to using a phony 
lens rather than showing the 
grittier and occasionally less-
pleasant truth of the stresses 
and 
anxieties 
that 
mothers 

actually experience. Void of 
unnecessary fluff and over-
dramatization, Jason Reitman’s 
film “Tully” offers audiences 
a fresh and sobering glimpse 
into the rarely revealed side of 
modern-day motherhood and 
its overshadowed intersection 
with mental health, challenging 
the unfair standards that expect 
constant stability and overall 
perfection from mothers.
Marlo 
(Charlize 
Theron, 
“Mad Max: Fury Road”), a 
mother of two elementary-aged 
kids and a newborn baby, is far 
beyond her breaking point. Life 
has become a merry-go-round, 
but instead of spinning around 
and around among colorful 
animals and smiling faces, Marlo 
is rotating through the same 
numbing routine that mainly 
consists of changing diapers, 
breastfeeding 
and 
prepping 
microwave dinners. In a state 

of perpetual sleeplessness and 
with minimal aid from her 
loving yet ridiculously unhelpful 
husband Drew, (Ron Livingston, 
“The 
Conjuring”) 
Marlo 
is 
running 
on 
empty, 
heading 
toward a downward mental 
spiral. However, a beacon of 
light shines down when, eager 
to revive his sister’s spirits, 
Marlo’s wealthy brother Craig 
(Mark Duplass, “Safety Not 
Guaranteed”) offers an unusual 
baby-shower gift: A night nurse.
Desperate for a sliver of R&R, 
Marlo takes her brother up on 
his offer, quickly finding herself 
face-to-face with the youthful, 
enviable and illustrious Tully 
(Mackenzie 
Davis, 
“Blade 
Runner 2049”). Despite Tully’s 
initial purpose of simply caring 
for the baby through the night, 
her 
late-night 
house 
calls 
gradually evolve into gossip-
filled evenings with Marlo. As 

the friendship between the two 
women grows, their bizarre, 
almost 
sister-like 
chemistry 
strengthens and, invigorated 
by Tully’s free-spirit and zest, 
Marlo slowly emerges from her 
state of emotional blankness 
and depression.
Through 
her 
character’s 
feelings 
of 
self-doubt, 
numbness 
and 
inner 
and 
outer 
exhaustion, 
Theron 
brilliantly delivers the powerful 
message that motherhood is 
multifaceted. While, in part, it 
is unconditional love, joy and 
relentless devotion, it can also 
lead to a loss of identity and 
emotional deterioration. Marlo’s 
unsweetened and uncensored 
moments as a mother create the 
tone of realness that persists 
throughout the movie.
Arguably most commendable 
about “Tully” is its boldness in 
tackling the theme of mental 

health, a topic seldom explored 
in adult characters. Throughout 
the film, as audience members, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
Marlo 
is 
experiencing 
some 
form 
of 
postpartum 
depression 
and 
severe, debilitating insomnia. 
Yet, the other characters in 
the 
film, 
Marlo’s 
husband 
included, are oblivious to her 
struggles. This oblivion speaks 
more broadly to the manner 
in which, until fairly recently, 
mental 
health, 
especially 
postpartum 
depression, 
was 
often 
unacknowledged 
as 
legitimate or relevant by society. 
Still today there exists a skewed 
and ancient notion that mental 
health can be boxed up and 
designated to fit a specific type 
of person, which simply is not 
true. Through the presentation 
of Marlo, a thirty-something 
mother and a character that 
viewers would not expect to 

be suffering from depression, 
“Tully” 
overturns 
the 
false 
assumptions that there is a mold 
of any sort for what mental 
health ‘should’ look like.
More than anything else, 
“Tully” is a film that aims to 
enlighten. Reitman re-evaluates 
the notion of motherhood from 
a more humanistic perspective, 
tearing 
down 
the 
implicit 
and 
outdated 
stereotypical 
standards that expect expert 
childcare, relentless positivity 
and 
endless 
smiles 
from 
mothers. With Mother’s Day fast 
approaching, “Tully” takes an 
unconventional route, exposing 
the reality of motherhood’s 
tribulations, 
honoring 
all 
mothers by challenging the 
illusion of ‘the perfect mother’ 
and beautifully shattering the 
misconception that there is a 
way that mothers are ‘supposed’ 
to be.

Fall 2018 — 1D


King Krule sinks deeper and deeper 
on his third full-length, ‘The OOZ’

London is a melting pot, sure, but 
Peckham is something else. There 
are Nigerian fashion retailers mixed 
with Jamaican chicken shacks; 
down the road there are cult-like 
gatherings where British youth 
reminisce about the days before 
CCTV monitored the top deck of 
buses. It’s a bizarre place, and a 
fitting home for Archy Marshall — 
a scraggly white kid with red hair, 
who cites J Dilla and Fela Kuti with 
equal reverence. 
Archy’s broad range of influences 
lends itself naturally to his scattered 
musical identity. His most acclaimed 
work is as King Krule, the enigmatic 
guitarist we haven’t seen since 2013, 
but he’s also Edgar The Beatmaker 
(Soundcloud producer), DJ JD 
Sports (Macbook rapper), Zoo Kid 
(depressed high schooler) and of 
course Archy Marshall (so far, a lo-fi 
cloud rapper).
His latest effort as King Krule, 
The OOZ, is largely characterized 
by the radio silence that preceded it. 
Since we’ve last seen him, he’s aged, 
fallen in and out of love, rapped with 
rappers and smoked in his ever-
changing native Peckham. On “A 
Slide (In New Drugs)” he quips “The 
cityscape, bourgeoisie change to 
replicate / How can I be feeling the 
same as you?”
It’s been four years, but he’s by 

and large the same as he once was. 
Where on 6 Feet Beneath The Moon 
Archy would yell at the sky, The 
OOZ sees him kick rocks through a 
cloud of smoke. While the years have 
certainly eroded the more explosive 
musical tendencies of his youth, the 
album features some of his clearest 
and sharpest songwriting to date.
At 17 he already had the 
perspective of a twice-divorced 
man, but now at 23, the pool of 
experience he draws from has 
grown even more burdensome. The 
album is his best attempt at letting 
it out, or perhaps letting us in, and 
while it’s not exactly a “happy place,” 
the incessant “ooz” of day-to-day 
life presents a challenge you simply 
learn to get on with.
On album-opener “Biscuit Town,” 
he rhymes “Gianfranco Zola” with 
“I think she thinks I’m bipolar”; his 
thoughts dart through his South 
London upbringing on inhale and 
move to relationships on exhale.
At times it’s hard to tell if his 
intense ruminations are really just 
melodramatic grouses. On “Vidual” 
he grumbles “I put my trust in many 
things but now I know that’s dumb 
/ So I don’t trust anyone, only get 
along with some / Saw that girl again 
one time and now I know it’s done”. 
It’s all just a bit passé for a 23 year old.
There are a lot of these soft 
murmurs on this album, but for the 
first time, there’s some absolute 
belting too, as we’d seen earlier this 

year on Mount Kimbie’s “Blue Train 
Lines.” At first pass it’s difficult to 
make sense of him screaming “I wish 
I was people!” on “Locomotive,” 
but honestly, when shit goes pear-
shaped, wouldn’t you love to be 
“people,” too? Other brash instances, 
like his “Half man with a body of 
a shark” chant (16 times over), are 
slightly more bewildering.
Archy front-loads most of the 
album’s flashpoints, like a guitar 
solo on “Dum Surfer” that sounds 
like you’re hearing it for the first 
time, every time. Later in the song he 
conjures imagery of him puking on 
the sidewalk before getting in a cab 
with a Slovakian girl.
Though “Dum Surfer” is his only 
“night out” on the album, most of the 
songs take place on nights where the 
darkness just swallows him whole. 
It’s less lad culture debauchery 
and more anxious rambling about 
relationships, family and self-doubt.
“Logos” for example, would not 
have been so out of place on Frank 
Ocean’s Endless (it’s similar in 
that way to his fantastic EP, A New 
Place 2 Drown). “I call my mum / 
She stumbles home / Through open 
ground / Back to broken homes” 
sounds like it’s being recited while 
sinking into his couch. Sonically, the 
song deviates from his traditional 
synth 
and 
guitar 
composition, 
adding elements of jazz he’s cited but 
never quite recreated until now.
That sinking feeling never leaves 

The OOZ, and the only thing that 
oscillates over the course of the 
album is his willingness to reach for 
others. Much of the album is about 
finding out if what you need is time 
alone or more time with someone 
else.
The drunk keys of “Czech One” 
bring with them the centerpiece of 
the album — a woozy song of lust, 
isolation and directionless passing of 
time. “She asked me why I’m here / 
But I come here every night / Do you 
need to tell her something? / No, I 
need a place to write”. In one verse, 
he “drown[s] too quick,” “fade[s] out 
of sight” and yet, “he still search[es] 
for warmth.”
In the music video, for a moment, 
he actually levitates over the 
pavement of Bermondsey; in a way, 
that’s what he’s been doing for the 
past five years. He’s always been 
floating in the middle, somewhere 
in-between. He’s five aliases at 
once. He’s “half man half shark,” 
half where he wants to be and half 
crumbling, physically present but 
mentally disintegrating.
The OOZ makes you question if it’s 
even worth getting up. It obscures 
what you think you know, because 
sometimes those downward spirals 
are just harsh realities you’d rather 
not believe. Sometimes it isn’t too 
bad to be true though — it’s just plain 
true. The OOZ is what lures you 
further into the couch. Sometimes 
that’s just where you need to be.

St. Vincent straddles coastal 
style in hot pink heeled boots

St. Vincent is a fabrication. 
It’s a creation slowly built and 
carved by Annie Clark, a project 
that came to resemble a human 
but wasn’t entirely meant to 
be. The name itself suggests 
the unreal, like the abstraction 
taken from an icon, a wistful 
sense of the holy that never was 
and isn’t still. That it’s Annie’s 
face which graces the cover of 
over half St. Vincent’s studio 
albums is beside the point: 
They share the same face, 
but St. Vincent is the image, 
Annie the person. Clark likes 
to play with that line between 
the persona and the person, 
but no matter how sweetly 
she has danced between the 
two, she still makes it known 
that it’s a performance. That 
creation has been her appeal 
to universality, and her Chloes 
and Johnnys, her “You”s and 
“I”s are all characters in this 
world building. 
On 
MASSEDUCTION, 
her fifth album, the tension 
between Annie and St. Vincent 
dominates. It means everything 
and still it’s more unclear than 
ever before. That’s St. Vincent 
on 
stage 
bemoaning 
the 
seduction of the masses. There’s 
the created image fearing the 
future. And yet, when we move 
beyond the plastic surgery she 
both mocks coyly and wears 
herself, there’s an unflagging 
clarity that feels new.
Never 
has 
she 
made 
a 
song like “New York.” Never 
has she felt so naked; never 
has 
her 
songwriting 
been 
so simply beautiful, so free 
of alien metaphor, straight-
talking 
yet 
poetic 
all 
the 
same. Here, she sings to a 
friend about definitions, about 
what a city means when those 
who made it everything are 
gone. Loss is consuming on 
MASSEDUCTION.
“New York” is the heart of 
this album, and so is the city. 
This is an album of love within 
a disease — within powerful 
addictions 
and 
temptations 
that rip people apart. And when 
she’s talking about love, she’s 
talking about New York. Her 
relationships mold that city, 
and when she walks through 
Time Square with her friend in 
“Happy Birthday, Johnny,” the 
loss she feels in the tear of that 
friendship is inexorably tied to 
those buildings. She sings him 
happy New Year and the ball 
drops for them both, far apart 
as they may be.
When she’s on the other 

coast, 
she’s 
singing 
about 
longing too, but it’s more lustful 
there, and a bit cheeky. On “Los 
Ageless,” 
she’s 
grinning 
at 
the superficial desires of that 
city. It’s a story of wants in 
Hollywood, this dying yearn for 
youthful perfection that will 
forever remain unattainable: 
“How can anybody have you? 
/ How can anybody have you 
and lose you?” That song and 
that city are a degree separated 
from 
reality. 
Los 
Ageless 
isn’t a place, and whoever or 
whatever you take the “you” 
as, it’s gone regardless. Like 
that illusion, the song itself 
is overly concocted, complete 
with the ’80s drum pattern 

and synths signature of pop 
producer Jack Antonoff, who 
co-produced this album. This 
formula appears all throughout 
MASSEDUCTION, and it can 
be relentless in its forced smile. 
Of course that’s the point, 
but it can make for a less than 
gratifying listen. “Los Ageless” 
never really goes anywhere. It 
hardly wavers from the straight 
line laid out by its chorus.
We can read the tension 
between St. Vincent and Annie 
Clark 
through 
the 
tension 
between the two coasts, and this 
album rides these two modes: 
She alternates between the 
plastic of San Bernardino and 
the wrought confessional of the 
concrete jungle. Loneliness and 
loss move between these coasts, 
certainly, but the separation 
between the cities defines how 
she processes these feelings. In 
New York she looks inwards; in 
Los Angeles she looks outwards 
(and 
isn’t 
too 
impressed). 
MASSEDUCTION is very much 
about flying between them.

The stretch from “Pills” 
to “Los Ageless” is that West 
coast concern for the outward. 
The seductions she tackles 
are broader and more of the 
masses, as the album title 
suggests. 
There 
aren’t 
the 
hyper-specific moments we get 
on the tracks about New York, 
like that hotel room where 
Johnny lights up his Bic lighter 
in “Happy Birthday, Johnny.” 
Instead we have abstractions; 
in the title track she sings of 
“A punk rock romantic” and 
“Nuns in stress position.” On 
“Pills,” she dances to a chipper 
club beat while describing a 
pill-induced haze that could 
be anyone’s. She sounds almost 
celebratory, and she gets away 
with it because she’s right there 
in it too, seduced by the drugs 
and technology herself. She 
avoids what easily could have 
been a gratingly haughty tone.
This slew of songs is the 
most upbeat on the album, 
and St. Vincent hardly lets up 
the guise. They’re interesting 
thought experiments, but they 
can grow a bit tiresome as they 
push farther in the album, 
almost 
monotonous. 
When 
that sound reappears as late as 
“Fear the Future,” it’s nearly 
exhausting. It’s what makes 
those New York tracks so 
stunning, such breaths of fresh 
air among all the sickness.
For a while we’re not sure 
whether the two sides of this 
album will ever truly meet: 
drug- and sex- fueled nights 
lead into confessionals without 
a clear sense of narrative. It’s 
not until the end that we see 
MASSEDUCTION as a single 
story, on the closing track, 
“Smoking Section.” The song is 
an absolute triumph. It brings 
the unresolved ends to light, and 
the apparent contradictions are 
explained. St. Vincent draws a 
sketch of someone on the edge, 
someone who sees how easily it 
could all burst into flames and 
kind of likes it, maybe wants 
it to happen. “Let it happen,” 
she sings. And yet she doesn’t. 
By the end she decides, “It’s 
not the end,” though it very 
well could have been. The 
track moves slowly, explodes, 
recoils and does it all over, like 
the turns this album makes 
track by track. It’s a glam rock 
ballad about pop suicide, which 
she contemplates like a dark 
game on her stage, waiting for 
someone to light her up. But she 
doesn’t want to step over that 
edge. She stays behind it, toying 
with 
her 
own 
destruction, 
reveling in the seduction all the 
same.

With ‘Virtue,’ Casablancas 
looks back (but not in anger)

I was fooled by “Leave it In My 
Dreams,” the first single off The 
Voidz’s sophomore effort, Virtue. 
I thought this was going to be a 
Strokes album. The muted riffs 
and sharp lyrics sound like an 
Angles bonus track.
But this is not a Strokes album, 
and it’s not exactly an album 
either. Virtue feels, instead, like a 
collection of everything frontman 
Julian Casablancas couldn’t do 
with that aforementioned band. 
It’s an outpouring of musical 
frustration.
It’s a mess, one that isn’t well 
served by determinations of 
“good” or “bad.” Some tracks 
excel, others confuse, but Virtue 
isn’t the sum of its unbalanced 
parts.
And 
Casablancas 
would 
probably love that designation. 
After 
his 
bonkers 
interview 
with Vulture, we know he’s a 
man whose steadfast ideologies 
are all but completely removed 
from reality. He’s easy to confuse 
with a certain love interest from 
a certain best picture nominee. 
Yes, that’s right. L’Enfance Nue 
is older, but in no way grown up.
And the Julian/Kyle parallel 
has never been more apparent 
than on Virtue. “I was soon sent 
off to school / Where the teachers 
gave me poison / And I drank it 
like a fool,” Casablancas sings 
on “Think Before You Drink, ” 
a track sonically reminiscent of 
“I’ll Try Anything Once.” He’s 
rightfully preoccupied with the 
world’s suffering and decay, but 

hasn’t yet grown out of seeing 
himself at its center.
On “Lazy Boy” — a song that 
lyrically could’ve been written 
by that one band from your 
high school (see previous “Lady 
Bird” reference) — Casablancas 
sings: “Jackets are the eyes 
to the soul,” proving he can 
actually 
be 
self 
reflective. 
Casablanca’s rebranding of a 
specific downtown cool for the 
new millennium cemented The 
Strokes in the visual cultural 
memory. He seems, here, to be 
trying to reconcile his desire 
for musical recognition and his 
wholehearted 
condemnation 
of 
music 
the 
world 
deems 
“popular.” It’s a true Catch-22 
for Julian: Fame is for frauds 
and obsolescence is for the 
untalented.
For brief moments — “Leave it 
in My Dreams” and “All Wordz 
Are Made Up” — Virtue sees 
the Voidz letting go, leaning 
wholeheartedly into a kind of 
joyful existentialism. Nothing 
matters! Isn’t that sort of fun? 
“No one will care about this in 10 
years,” he sings on “All Wordz Are 
Made Up,” in another moment 
of self awareness. He seems to 
understand the shelf life of his 
specific celebrity brand, and his 
precarious position in popular 
culture. But these tracks lack the 
self-lamentation found in other 
corners of the album. They’re, 
even 
if 
only 
momentarily, 
carefree in their nihilism.
Virtue is an operation in 
nostalgia that tries to front as 
forward thinking. Casablancas 
got slammed for rewriting the 

’70s with The Strokes. With The 
Voidz, he’s moved his musical 
homage a decade into the future — 
mining the ’80s in all their synth-
filled, vocally distorted glory. In 
that sense, Virtue is progressive 
for an artist obsessed with the 
past. But it’s not progressive for 
2018, not really.
Casablancas isn’t looking into 
the future at all. In many ways, 
Virtue feels like a last ditch effort 
— one final shot to get all the 
things in his head into an album. 
In a move that leans more towards 
a mixtape than a cohesive album, 
the Voidz bounce from art rock to 
synth pop to a weird attempt at 
metal (the aptly titled “Pyramid 
of Bones”). It’s as disjointed as it 
is unbalanced. But, as we know, 
when Casablancas is on, he’s on 
and when he’s not, he’s so earnest 
in his attempt that you can’t help 
but applaud it.
For moments he feels jaded 
in his surrender to middle age. 
While 
his 
primary 
business 
has 
always 
been 
nostalgia, 
Casablancas seems to be looking 
back on his own life: his youth, his 
angst, his glory. And it’s hard to 
blame him, The Strokes rocked. 
So we can revel in this mess of an 
album a little longer than most, 
cut it’s chaos more slack than 
we otherwise would. Virtue is 
exactly what we knew would 
happen when Julian Casablancas 
had to finally grow up.
There are very few things I 
know to be absolute truths but 
among them are these: New York 
rock isn’t dead yet and Julian 
Casablancas is no longer it’s 
savior. And maybe he never was.

‘Silicon Valley’ finds itself again in 
its fifth season, after a rough patch

As someone who grew up in 
Silicon Valley, the HBO show 
of the same name always felt 
uncannily more like a documentary 
than a comedy. From the get-
go, “Silicon Valley” has been an 
astute satire of the Valley, a place 
where obscene amounts of money 
and 
a 
somewhat 
overzealous 
sense of self-importance produce 
an 
idiosyncratic 
environment. 
Ironically, the show has been 
enthusiastically embraced by the 
very demographic it relentlessly 
pokes fun at. Walk into any 
startup office or CS building at any 
university and you’ll find that our 
(speaking as an engineer) affinity 
towards the show’s humor is not 
entirely dissimilar to a 12-year-old’s 
towards toilet humor. Guaranteed 
guffaws at popular sound bites such 
as “this guy fucks” or “middle out” 
illustrate how “Silicon Valley” has 
transcended into being a possibly 
niche, but still hilarious cultural 
icon.
Nonetheless, I was quite worried 
going into season five. Season four 
was easily the series’s weakest, 
with Pied Piper going frustratingly 
nowhere during the course of 
the entire season and Richard 
Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch, 
“Kong: Skull Island”) going from 
lovable awkward nerd into a 
character that was at too many 
points simply painful to watch. The 
satire still had its edge, but it seemed 
like the show’s magic was just about 
running out. Was the show just 
overstaying its welcome?

Thankfully, the beginning of 
season five has me cautiously 
optimistic. We find the team 
without Erlich Bachmann (T.J. 
Miller, “Deadpool”) for the first time 
after a disappearance in Tibet, and 
although Erlich is one of the show’s 
most notable characters, I wasn’t 
quite miffed by his departure. By 
the end of season four, he was just 
a cheap source of crude humor, a 
deadbeat who had little relevance 
to the plot or progress of Pied 
Piper. It turned out that T.J. Miller 
in real life was becoming a bit too 
much like the character he played, 
forcing the writers to strand him in 
the mountains. Oh well. Anyway, 
season five sees the group move 
into a new office, and throughout 
the course of the first few episodes, 
welcome a large group of engineers.
And to that I say: finally! Pied 
Piper is finally actually making 
some progress. One of the aspects of 
season four that was so frustrating 
was the feeling that the show 
didn’t have to be quite so cyclical. 
The possibilities for conflict and 
comedy with a larger team as Pied 
Piper expands are limitless. While 
Richard is still hopelessly unfit 
as a motivator and CEO (an early 
scene has him give a ridiculously 
cringeworthy speech to his new 
employees), he shows glimpses of a 
Silicon Valley staple many viewers 
of the show are expecting to pan 
out: the transformation from being 
a brilliant, dopey coder to a ruthless 
businessman, 
aka 
Hooli 
CEO 
Gavin Belson (Matt Ross, “Captain 
Fantastic”).
Belson is brilliant as ever, with a 
renewed zeal to destroy the upstart 

Pied Piper. The show continues 
to excel at his characterization as 
well as incorporating new gags, 
including a recurring bit that 
involves three new coders the team 
dubs “stallions, each one more 
magnificent than the last.” Each 
time the stallions are mentioned, 
sentimental music plays while the 
camera pans to three disheveled 
engineers rubbing their eyes while 
squinting at their laptops. While 
Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani, “The Big 
Sick”) and Guilfoyle (Martin Starr, 
“Spider Man: Homecoming”) have 
not developed as much as I would 
like, their interactions are as snide 
and petty as ever, and characters 
such as Laurie Breem (Suzanne 
Cryer, “The Cloverfield Paradox”) 
remain as perfect imitations of some 
of Silicon Valley’s more unusual 
personalities. Jared (Zach Woods, 
“The Post”), one of the show’s most 
intriguing characters, continues to 
drop some truly disturbing lines, 
which leads me to think he grew up 
in a weird cultist/Neo-Nazi family.
Meanwhile in Erlich’s absence, 
Jian Yang (Jimmy O. Yang, “Crazy 
Rich Asians”) takes over and hatches 
a plot to “inherit” his wealth. While 
Jian Yang is hilarious in short 
bursts, it is worrying that the show 
has set him up to potentially be a 
main villain of sorts. At the moment, 
he still feels stuck as a caricature.
“Silicon Valley” is back, sort of. 
Early on, season five is encouraging, 
actually stimulating the idea that 
Pied Piper will grow and encounter 
a new set of problems. However, as 
I stated before, I remain cautiously 
optimistic.

Lorde brings pure magic to Detroit 
as the ‘Melodrama’ tour continues

In the never-ending whirlwind 
of bar and club shows, it’s easy 
to forget the magic that occurs 
alongside the detail and attention 
given 
to 
full-scale 
concert 
productions. Lorde’s show on 
Wednesday night at Detroit’s 
Little Caesars Arena was truly 
nothing short of pure magic.
Before her set, Lorde received 
some fantastic support from the 
inimitable queen of indie rock, 
Mitski, and explosive hip-hop duo 
Run The Jewels. With an early 
set time, Mitski unfortunately 
played to a half-empty arena 
while seats slowly filled, but was 
nonetheless spectacular, with a 
set that included the anthemic 
“Your Best American Girl” and 
closed with the scathing “Drunk 
Walk Home.” Run The Jewels 
played most of their hits like, 
“Call Ticketron” and “Stay Gold,” 
upping the rhythm and energy of 
the crowd in preparation for our 
Lorde and savior to take the stage.
Within a matter of seconds 
into her opening song “Sober,” 
the entire arena was transformed 
into Lorde’s own dreamscape, 
a 
transmutable 
playground 
for her to share her deepest 
secrets and darkest emotions. 

Background dancers flooded the 
stage when necessary to set the 
scene — an intimate party during 
“Homemade Dynamite” and a 
sensual dance between lovers 
during “The Louvre.” All at once, 
Lorde left everything and nothing 
to the imagination with settings 
as personally subjective as needed 
but altogether objective in their 
presentation.
Lorde 
herself 
transformed 
throughout 
the 
performance, 
starting the show with a sleek 
black outfit, changing midway 
through the show on stage into 
a flowing pink gown that she 
then later exchanged for flared 
red bottoms with a matching 
ruffled top. Lorde took the crowd 
through the emotions of her 
music with these expertly timed 
changes, reflecting the deftly 
planned setlist. Melding cuts from 
Melodrama and Pure Heroine 
together, Lorde presented a young 
and intense love broken down to 
the sweet innocence of intimacy, 
eventually bringing us to a spiteful 
but 
reflective 
post-breakup 
independence.
This is the artist of a generation 
at her most affecting, most genuine 
and truly most breathtaking. 
Her show was both a visual 
and auditory spectacle, blended 
perfectly into a story deeply and 

universally resonant. Prefacing 
“Ribs” off of Pure Heroine with 
“This is a song I wrote when I 
was 16,” she reminded the crowd 
of her former outlook as a teen, 
tracing the messy path to young 
adulthood with an incredibly 
perceptive eye. She took the time 
to thank the crowd for being 
with her, reflecting on the fact 
that she was once writing her 
songs alone in a bedroom without 
ever imagining she’d be sharing 
them with arenas full of people. 
Lorde also interposed a gorgeous 
cover of Frank Ocean’s “Solo” 
between “Writer in the Dark” and 
“Liability,” reflecting on her own 
efficacy in the messy melodrama 
of life through these three tracks. 
“Supercut” had the entire crowd 
screaming along, reminiscing on 
the purest, happiest moments of 
life scattered throughout the dark.
If Lorde’s performance showed 
us anything, it’s that we truly do 
not deserve an artist with such 
overwhelming talent. Without the 
words to do her justice, I’ll leave 
you with this: Few artists are able 
to so magnificently capture acute 
emotion the way Lorde has with 
her music, and her performance 
follows suit in a way that is so 
immersive 
and 
tangible 
it’s 
almost impossible not to feel the 
melodrama.

Sofia Coppola’s ‘The Virgin Suicides’ and the loneliness of girlhood

At the tender age of 28, Sofia 
Coppola (“The Beguiled”) wrote 
and directed the 1999 drama, 
“The Virgin Suicides,” based off 
of the 1993 Jeffrey Eugenides 
novel of the same name. The 
film set Coppola apart from her 
legendary father — Francis Ford 
Coppola of “Godfather” fame 
— and highlighted her dreamy, 
unique and definitively brilliant 
style. Coppola the younger has 
gone on to write and direct 
award-winning films such as 
“Lost in Translation” (2003), 
“Marie Antoinette” (2006) and 
“Somewhere” (2010), making her 
an auteur in her own right.
For one night and one night 
only, 
the 
Michigan 
Theater 
screened Coppola’s first film, 
“The Virgin Suicides,” as a part 
of the nationwide initiative called 
Science on Screen, which pairs 
films with science speakers. “The 
Virgin Suicides” was screened in 
conjunction with national youth 
speaker Jim Tuman on the teen 
suicide epidemic. Tuman spoke 
about his own experiences with 
suicide, from clients to parents 
to fan mail. Tuman reiterated 
how the film depicts loneliness as 
not necessarily being by oneself, 
but a sort of existential solitude 
that can be felt even in the most 
crowded of places.
“The Virgin Suicides” takes 
place in Grosse Pointe, Mich. in 
the mid ’70s. The film centers 
on the tragically beautiful and 

sheltered Lisbon sisters. The five 
girls — Therese, Mary, Bonnie, 
Lux and Cecilia — are an enigma 
to the neighborhood boys. Told 
from the boys’ perspective, the 
audience looks upon the Lisbon 
girls with the obsessive and 
voyeuristic, telescope-clad eyes 
of hormone-heavy, brace-faced, 
adolescent boys. The story starts 
the summer when the youngest 
sister, 
Cecilia 
(Hanna 
Hall, 
“Visible Scars”), slit her wrists in 
the bath tub at the age of 13. She 
survived her suicide attempt, but 
with it came a plethora or rumors, 
whispers 
and 
neighborhood 
gossip. The film approaches the 
taboo and elicit topic of suicide 
with finesse and care. While 
the subject matter is bleak and 
objectively 
tragic, 
Coppola 
applies a dreamy, hazy sepia 
filter to counteract the pain. The 
film — at points — is hilarious. 
Using Giovanni Ribisi’s (“Sneaky 
Pete”) ambiguous narration as 
an omnipresent documentarian, 
commenting and criticizing the 
story from within through the 
third-person perspective of the 
novel. The film raises questions on 
helicopter parenting, fetishizing 
tragedy and the loneliness of 
girlhood with such expertise and 
nuance that it is hard to believe it 
was Coppola’s first feature film.
Kirsten 
Dunst 
(“The 
Beguiled”) steals the screen as 
the flirtatious and rebellious 
Lux Lisbon. The former child 
star commands the screen with 
her seductive gaze and youthful 
vigor, permitting an abundance 

of eager eyes to fall in love with 
her. Dunst’s Lux personifies the 
film’s message of isolation — the 
way it feels to be surrounded by 
people but still alone. She is the 
object of unattainable desire, an 
untouchable celebrity drenched 
in self-doubt and overcome with 
the intoxicating and isolating 
feeling of total and complete 
solitude. 
Trip 
Fontaine, 
the 
epitome of the ’70s high school 
sex god, played by a baby-faced 
Josh Hartnett (“6 Below: Miracle 
on the Mountain”), is infatuated 
by Lux’s indifference towards 
him. Interestingly, Trip is the only 
one we see in the future as the 
narrator details the events from 
a place far, far away from Grosse 
Pointe. Future Trip is no sex god, 
rather an institutionalized man-
child, still thinking about the 
night he took Lux’s innocence on 
an empty football field. Lux and 
her sisters left a dark hole in the 
psyche of their neighborhood, 
turning their lives into more of 
a myth than a reality. Coppola 
beautifully captures the pains of 
girlhood, from boys to tampons 
to homecoming dances. What the 
audience hears is the narration 
of a fan boy, recalling the girls 
he never understood, but what 
they see is the unequivocal and 
crippling solitude of adolescence. 
This dissonance is the hallmark 
of Coppola’s filmmaking, creating 
a dialectic between the internal 
and external, the seen and the 
unseen.
In addition to marking the 
beginning of Coppola’s successful 

career, “The Virgin Suicides” 
highlights some of the auteur’s 
most identifiable and appealing 
stylistic 
choices. 
Coppola’s 
photography 
background 
is 
evident in her films from the 
concentration on framing and 
composition. She clearly takes 
her time on the art of the shot, 
creating tiny masterpieces within 
the larger masterpiece of her 
motion pictures. Framing is a 
key aspect of the director’s work, 
highlighting 
the 
character’s 
feelings and state of mind by 
showing, not telling — using the 
actor’s expressions and body 
language to capture the mood. 
The soundtrack plays like a high 
school mix tape from the ’70s, 

featuring the Bee Gees, Steely 
Dan and Boston. The original 
score, conveying the ethereal 
tone of the film, was composed by 
the French duo Air.
On Apr. 24, the Criterion 
Collection 
will 
release 
a 
digital restoration of the film, 
including interviews with the 
actors, 
a 
documentary 
from 
the director’s mother Eleanor 
Coppola, “Making of ‘The Virgin 
Suicides’” and the director’s 
1998 
short 
film, 
“Lick 
the 
Star.” The Criterion Collection 
beautifully sums up, that: “‘The 
Virgin Suicides’ conjures the 
ineffable melancholy of teenage 
longing and ennui,” adding that 
“the film secured a place for 

its director in the landscape of 
American independent cinema 
and has become a coming-of-age 
touchstone.”
The fleeting, ghostly beauty of 
Coppola’s masterful first foray 
into her own coming-of-age as 
a filmmaker is iconic in its own 
right, paving the way for female 
filmmakers 
to 
make 
movies 
that matter. Just like the brief, 
transitory lives of the Lisbon 
girls, Coppola’s film lingers long 
after the screen fades to black. It 
is a true testament to Coppola’s 
talent that the film has remained 
so current. Based on the ’70s, 
released in the ’90s and revived 
in 2018, the film is still relevant as 
ever for generations of girls.

Disclaimer: Yes, it’s a little 
embarrassing how thoroughly I 
researched this article and how 
many pages of lyrics I obviously 
had to go through to come up with 
this list. It’s ridiculous to care this 
much about Taylor Swift when 
everybody knows cool people 
with Good Music Opinions don’t 
do that. But consider this: My 
apathy toward having a Good 
and Cool Music Opinion is equal 
and opposite in strength to how 
deeply I care about chronicling 
the evolution of the Dress as a 
motif in Taylor Swift’s music. 
Also, for the pedants out there, 
yes, “Love Story” has a dress in it 
but I left it off of this list because 
it’s a wedding dress and I just 
don’t think there’s much deeper 
meaning to it (I still <3 you, “Love 
Story”). We good? Good.
1. “Tim McGraw”
Key lyric: “When you think 
happiness / I hope you think ‘that 
little black dress’”
Taylor Swift has built a career 
out of weaponizing memory. Her 
gift is in the details: conjuring 
up tiny moments so specific 
and intimate that they become 
universal enough to stab you in the 
heart. She reveals just enough so 
that it feels real, but not too much 
that it feels like it’s only Taylor-
applicable. When a Taylor Swift 
song comes on the radio, we’re 
invited to not only to listen to her 
story, but also to understand how 
it’s our story, too. It’s no accident 
that this was the first song Taylor 
ever released, all about how 
memory can turn heartbreak 
into something a little gentler, a 
little more bittersweet. In “Tim 
McGraw,” she turns moments of 
their time together into relics of 
a time long gone: the song they 
used to dance to, a pair of jeans 
and, of course, a dress. Really, 
she’s repurposing these memories 
to construct an image of herself: 
“When you think Tim McGraw / I 
hope you think my favorite song... 
/ When you think happiness / I 
hope you think that little black 
dress.” It’s about the power of a 
reminder. Just like that, it’s not 
any old dress anymore. And in 
his memory, that’s how she’ll be 

forever: wearing that black dress, 
dancing to that old song. What’s 
funny though is how that image 
stuck, not just in his memory, but 
in ours. Taylor in a dress is one 
of her defining images, and it’s 
embedded deep in our cultural 
databank. Because the Dress isn’t 
just a piece of clothing: It’s Taylor 
herself.
2. “Fearless”
Key lyric: “I don’t know why / 
But with you, I’d dance in a storm in 
my best dress / Fearless”
Sometimes the Dress is a 
distillation of Taylor herself, and 
sometimes, like we see here, it’s a 
shorthand for a certain grandness 
of feeling — the Dress as a way 
to externalize the process of a 
heart swelling. The album art 
that accompanied this song in 
the lyric booklet is appropriately 
melodramatic 
(and 
in 
classic 
Swiftian fashion, a completely 
unsubtle and literal reenactment 
of the lyrics), Taylor in a fabulous 
blue evening gown with her back 
arched as she dances on a rain-
soaked street. The Dress signifies 
an emotion here, a ridiculous, 
almost embarrassing-to-say-out-
loud emotion that doesn’t make 
sense in words, it only makes 
sense in actions (or in a Taylor 
Swift song). Saying it isn’t enough 
— dancing in a storm in your best 
dress might cut it, though.
3. “Today Was a Fairytale”
Key lyric: “I wore a dress / You 
wore a dark grey t-shirt / You told 
me I was pretty when I looked like a 
mess / Today was a fairytale”
Taylor is so good at picking 
details. She offers no commentary 
here, she just presents these 
precious and tiny memories like 
facts. Today was a fairytale — 
that’s not her opinion, it’s just 
what today was. Again, the Dress 
is a way of creating an image of 
Taylor in an aftermath. She writes 
in the first person here, but it’s like 
she’s imagining herself as part of a 
story, reflecting on an experience 
from a comfortable third-person 
distance. At this point in her 
career, it’s “Today was a fairytale 
/ I wore a dress” but later it’ll 
become “It was rare / I was there / 
I remember it all too well.” In both 
cases, her memory is sharp, and 
it’s used as evidence of a feeling. 
Somebody else might try and deny 

it happened but she was there. 
Today was a fairytale and this is a 
fact, as concrete and airtight as the 
fact that she wore a dress.
Also important to note is that 
Taylor knows the connotations 
of a dress — the way the vision 
of a pretty girl in a pretty dress 
can make a story immediately 
softer, more romantic. And I 
mean, Taylor’s work has always 
built on this distinctly feminine 
association — all hand hearts and 
red lipstick and kittens. Emotional 
and messy, pretty and soft, a 
close examination of the whims 
of a teenage heart. I think this is 
why people tended to write her 
off, especially in the early years, 
because, well, there’s nothing 
especially important about a girl 
in a dress, right?
4. “Dear John”
Key lyric: “The girl in the dress 
wrote you a song”
Yeah, so there’s a lot that’s 
important about a girl in a dress. 
“Dear John” is a culmination 
of sorts. Taylor spent the first 
five years of her career-defining 
herself by a fluttering, deeply 
emotional 
romanticism, 
and 
“Dear John” is, I think, a defining 
moment in Taylor’s evolution 
as an artist: It’s the point when 
shit started getting really, really 
real. Not that I think there’s 
anything light or frivolous about 
her earlier work (“Fifteen” packs 
a hell of a punch and “Forever & 
Always” is full of enough vitriol 
and spite to kill a dozen Jonas 
Brothers, let alone the one it was 
written about), but “Dear John” 
is almost seven straight minutes 
of 
emotional 
excavation 
that 
completely hollows you out before 
lighting your heart just a little 
bit on fire. It’s the Dress, though, 
that really kills me. “The girl in 
the dress wrote you a song” could 
easily be a one-line manifesto 
for Taylor’s entire career. It’s an 
acknowledgment that there are 
strings attached to being a girl in 
a dress, a thing the world sees as 
meaningless, effeminate, stupid.
The Girl in the Dress isn’t taken 
seriously, not ever. Nobody ever 
expected her to fight back — to 
write something as sharp and 
painful and true as “Dear John.” 
Nobody expects the girl who wrote 
a song like “Love Story” to write 

lines like: “And you’ll add my name 
to your long list of traitors who 
don’t understand / And I’ll look 
back in regret how I ignored when 
they said, / ‘Run as fast as you 
can.’” But that’s the whole point. 
The Girl in the Dress is a fragile, 
frilly thing who’s pretty and gentle 
and has her heart perpetually 
broken. Well, she’s angry now, and 
she has something to say. There’s 
a reason this song resonates so 
well, a reason that the crowd is 
full of shining tear-stained faces 
every time she performs it. Taylor 
knows that what it’s like to feel 
underestimated and small — but 
she also knows how to turn her 
vulnerabilities 
into 
strengths. 
The Dress, something that once 
coded her to the world as soft 
and feminine and weak, becomes 
her weapon of choice. “Don’t you 
think I was too young to be messed 
with” sounds like an admission 
of hurt, and it kind of is, but the 
way she sings it makes me think 
it’s more an attack than anything 
else. You hurt me, she seems to say, 
and that’s on you. “The girl in the 
dress cried the whole way home / 
I should’ve known” becomes “The 
girl in the dress wrote you a song / 
You should’ve known.”
On the Speak Now tour, Taylor 
used to act out this transition in 
vivid color. She would perform this 
song wearing a purple dress and a 
ponytail, and sang part of the song 
hunched over her microphone, 
sitting on the stairs in a grand show 
of heartbreak. But somewhere 
between “I should’ve known” and 
“You should’ve known,” she would 
always stand up, the song building 
in momentum. When she got to 
the line “I’m shining like fireworks 
over your sad empty town,” 
massive sparks would shoot from 
the stage, and for a minute all you 
could see was her shape against 
the lights — the silhouette of a girl 
in a dress, singing you her song.
5. “Better Than Revenge”
Key lyric: “They didn’t teach you 
that in prep school so it’s up to me 
/ but no amount of vintage dresses 
give you dignity”
So we’re gonna ignore the 
unfortunate 
2010-era 
slut 
shaming that permeates this song 
and instead focus on the fact that 
Taylor Swift wears more vintage 
dresses than like 99 percent 

of people in this world, so this 
insult is either a self-aware many-
layered joke or a deeply hilarious 
self-burn. Either way, it makes me 
really happy. Also, Taylor refers 
to boys exclusively as toys and 
property in this song and I am very 
proud of her.
6. “Holy Ground”
Key lyric: “Spinning like a girl in 
a brand new dress / we had this big 
wide city all to ourselves”
Like in “Fearless,” the Dress 
is a shorthand for a sparkling 
feeling. A girl in a brand new dress 
spins and it’s a signifier for the 
wide open emotion of first love 
and youth. She’s so happy that 
she twirls; she can’t contain it. In 
“Holy Ground” memories stack 
on top of each other, the words 
coming quickly and breathlessly 
as if she can’t help herself, she just 
has to get this off her chest. I don’t 
think it’s a coincidence that this 
song is the perfect tempo to spin 
along to (not that I’ve tested it out 
or anything — ahem). The whole 
song sounds like a rush of emotion 
— it sounds the way spinning in a 
brand new dress feels. It’s notable 
here, though, that Taylor herself 
isn’t the Girl in the Dress anymore. 
She’s spinning like the girl. The 
image of herself as the fluttery 
romantic girl is a past tense thing 
now, a self-created archetype 
relegated to memory. “Darling it 
was good / never looking down / 
and right there where we stood 
was holy ground,” she sings, and 
you get the feeling that the brand 
new dress is a piece of that ancient 
history. The old Taylor isn’t dead 
yet, but she’s fading away.
7. “Dress”
Key lyric: “Only bought this dress 
so you could take it off”
I don’t know if Taylor Swift 
wrote “Dress” using every single 
narrative device I love most in this 
world specifically with me in mind, 
but I am very grateful it exists 
anyway. After spending 10 years 
building a distinct image off being 
a Girl in a Dress, she quite literally 
throws that dress on the floor. 
Reputation may not have been the 
image overhaul we expected based 
on its marketing, but “Dress” 
is a quiet deconstruction of the 
Taylor she used to be. “Dress” is 
what happens when a hopeless 
romantic grows up. Instead of 

“Today was a fairytale / I wore a 
dress” it’s “Flashback when you 
met me / your buzz cut and my 
hair bleached / even in my worst 
times / you could see the best in 
me.” These are still gentle, tender 
memories, full of love, but they’re 
less about using retrospect as a 
way to construct a romanticized 
version of the past, and more an 
admission of honesty.
For the most part though, 
“Dress” is a completely different 
kind of Taylor Swift song in that it’s 
written in the present tense. She’s 
careful to say it’s a “flashback” 
rather than the usually unspoken 
agreement between listener and 
singer that the whole song is a 
memory. With the exception of 
maybe “Sparks Fly” I don’t think 
she’s ever written a song about 
wanting somebody in the now. 
But the Girl in the Dress is getting 
older, and so she turns all of her 
old habits on their head in “Dress,” 
a song all about the nuances of the 
now. “My hands are shaking from 
holding back from you,” she sings, 
and there’s nothing bittersweet 
about it, the way her details 
usually are. It’s unfiltered, clean, 
straight to the vein emotion, no 
hazy layers of memory between 
the Taylor singing and the Taylor 
experiencing.
Up until this very moment, 
the Dress has been a marker of a 
Taylor long gone, a Taylor alive 
only in a memory. The Dress has 
been in dusty pickup trucks, it’s 
gotten ruined in the rain, it’s been 
worn on first dates and last dates, 
it’s been a sign of weakness and 
a spectacular show of strength 
— but it has never made it into a 
present tense song before. The 
Dress has been a distillation of 
Taylor herself and it has been an 
image Taylor sees from a distance, 
watching herself wearing it. But 
in the end, it’s always been part 
of a story. It’s a way of turning her 
life into a narrative, a process that 
grants her a kind of immortality — 
because an image can live forever 
in the memory of someone long 
gone.
It’s powerful stuff, writing 
yourself into a story, into someone 
else’s very heart. But if Taylor 
Swift has taught me anything, it’s 
that the Girl in the Dress is a lot 
more than a memory. She’s real.

I love Taylor Swift, and a couple other concerns 

‘A Fantastic Woman’ is a 
triumph thanks to Vega

Chilean foreign film “A Fantastic 
Woman” completely lives up to its 
title, proving itself to be fantastic, 
if not outstanding. “A Fantastic 
Woman” 
is 
a 
consummate 
example of giving minority gender 
identity stories a voice in film, 
especially with visionary direction 
by Chilean-Argentinian director 
Sebastián Lelio (“Gloria”) and 
a breathtaking performance by 
Daniela Vega (“The Guest”). It 
is no shocker as to why it rivaled 
American films this past season, 
resulting in an Oscar win for Best 
Foreign Language Film. 

A story to be revered and 
admired, “A Fantastic Woman” 
underscores the complexities and 
complications of love and loss, and 
the quest for personal and gender 
identity. Marina, played by Vega, 
is a transgender woman living 
as a singer in Chile, dating an 
older, wealthier divorcee, Orlando 
(Francisco Reyes, “Neruda”). But 
despite some tropes of relationships 
with a vast age difference, Marina 
doesn’t use Orlando for his money. 
Marina doesn’t care about any of 
that. In fact, the only possession 
she desires after his passing is the 

dog they share. Orlando provides 
her with one thing that no one else 
can: He sees her. When Orlando 
suddenly suffers an aneurysm and 
dies, Marina is forced to confront 
prejudices and suffer abuse from 
Orlando’s family. They try and tear 
her down, but she perseveres.
“A Fantastic Woman” is also a 
tale about self-preservation and 
resistance. Lelio doesn’t give us 
much of a glimpse into Marina’s 
backstory 
because 
we 
don’t 
require it. The film’s dialogue is 
simple and deliberate. Based on 
Vega’s performance — its nuance, 
tenderness and strength — we 
can infer it hasn’t been easy for 
her, but it’s not overly sentimental 
and it doesn’t make us feel pity for 
her. She is ridiculed by Orlando’s 
ex-wife, who calls her a “chimera,” 
or a fire-breathing monster in 
Greek mythology. The investigator 
who questions her after Orlando 
dies refuses to call her Marina 
because he knows she is trans. 
But none of this surprises Marina; 
she doesn’t expect anything from 
anyone, which makes the loss of 
her love, her one piece of hope, 
all the more heartbreaking. Vega 
herself, 
who 
brings 
Marina’s 
fortitude to life, is a big trans 
rights crusader in South America. 

This will not be Vega’s last stellar 
performance.
Vega tells the story through 
her acting, while the rest of the 
story is told through avant-garde 
cinematography by Lelio that 
elevates 
the 
film’s 
aesthetics 
into an artful and abstract piece 
of work. Despite some sleepy 
moments, daytime shots are met 
with sensual, dream-like night 
sequences with colored lights 
and glitter that reflect Marina’s 
deepest desires of peace — to be 
met back with her love and be on 
the stage. Sparkly choreographed 
sequences of Marina dancing and 
singing, breaking the fourth wall 
and distancing from the reality of 
the piece, don’t allow us to forget 
about her suffering. And the 
quite striking and unusual shot 
of Marina walking as the wind 
pushes back on her, used in the 
trailer, is an in-your-face visual 
allegory of her defiance in a world 
that repeatedly tries to knock her 
down.
Really, “A Fantastic Woman” is 
about not judging others. It urges 
us to be accepting and to open 
our minds and our hearts. It’s 
heartbreaking, at times too tragic 
to even watch, but by the end, 
we’re all on Marina’s side.

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS

What’s better than a story about 
a man and his dog? A story about 
a man and his horse. Er, a boy and 
his horse, in the case of “Lean on 
Pete,” the most recent film from 
the 
burgeoning 
powerhouse 
that is A24 and director Andrew 
Haigh. Adopted from the novel of 
the same name, written by Willy 
Vlautin, “Lean on Pete” tells the 
story of working-class, 15-year-
old Charley Thompson (Charlie 
Plummer, “Boardwalk Empire”) 
who has just moved to Portland, 
Oregon with his single father and 
is looking for work. “Lean on Pete” 
is at once a coming-of-age story 
and gut-punching drama that 
forces its protagonist to grapple 
with problems that most people 
will never have to face. Above 
all, though, it never glamorizes 
its characters’ troubles or inflicts 
trauma without intention. “Lean 
on 
Pete” 
reminds 
audiences 
how strong the desire for self-
preservation can be.
The film begins simply: Charley 
alone in his house, hearing through 
a door the sounds of his father and 
his girlfriend having a flirtatious 
chat in the bedroom. He leaves 

to go run, presumably used to his 
father’s behavior, and discovers 
Portland Downs nearby. There’s a 
magnetic connection. Charley goes 
to work for Del (Steve Buscemi, 
“Neo Yokio”), a racer who owns the 
eponymous horse, to make a little 
money. With it, he buys food, which 
reveals the family’s financial need. 
Haigh illustrates how Charley’s 
literal hunger, a recurring problem 
in the film, motivates almost all 
that he does. There are multiple 
scenes involving food that serve as 
punctuation for Charley’s journey: 
His home kitchen, the restaurant 
at the tracks and the gas station 
where he steals a map and a pastry 
wrapped in plastic. 
Although “Lean on Pete” does 
do good work with basic wants 
and needs in its beginning third, 
it can occasionally feel robotic. 
Scenes involving more than two 
characters are stiff and staged, 
and they stick out in a film that is 
so good at capturing the emotional 
experience of a person alone. This 
is evident when Charley has to 
interact with both Del and jockey 
Bonnie 
(Chloë 
Sevigny, 
“The 
Snowman”) in the same scene. The 
dialogue seems uneasy, as if the 
film knows that it’s about Charley’s 
internal experience. 

Once 
past 
its 
first 
third, 
however, “Lean on Pete” blossoms 
in to a journey of survival and 
self-discovery, as Charley goes 
on a quest to find his Aunt Margy 
(Alison Elliott, “20th Century 
Women”). En route, he is forced 
to make some difficult decisions, 
some of which lead him to lie, steal 
and harm others. By the same 
token, his motives are pure — he’s 
looking for safety and comfort 
in a dangerous world. The film, 
however, never places a moral 
judgment on Charley’s actions. It 
never strays from emphasizing 
Charley’s will to complete his task.
Above all, Charlie Plummer 
gives a performance that borders 
on greatness. Plummer’s ability to 
convey Charley’s vulnerability and 
resilience is never cartoonish or 
ham-handed, and he knows exactly 
when to channel which trait. 
The film’s emphasis on Charley’s 
interiority requires an actor that can 
display a wide range of experience, 
and Plummer is up to snuff. 
Without him, the film could have 
fallen prey to overdramatization 
or sentimentality. “Lean on Pete” 
keeps its focus tight, demanding its 
audience to witness the tenacity of 
the human spirit.

 6D — Fall 2018

Ever since “‘03 Bonnie & 
Clyde,” Jay-Z and Beyoncé have 
wanted you to know two things 
about their relationship: they’re 
in love and they’re rich. For 
years that’s the most they’ve 
cared to divulge. They kept 
their 2008 wedding as hush-
hush as possible and would 
almost never be caught publicly 
without sunglasses — Jay often 
opted to cover his eyes while 
they sat courtside at indoor 
NBA games. They popped up 

here and there as if to bless 
us with their public presence, 
but that exterior appearance 
was all us normal people got to 
witness.
It wasn’t until 2016, with the 
release of Beyoncé’s creative 
opus Lemonade, that cracks in 
the perfect marble sculpture 
of the Carters became visible. 
Bey not only touched on the 
social and political nature of 
Black love, but the personal 
as well; she was on a quest for 
self-knowledge in the face of 
infidelity. That infidelity, Jay-
Z’s alone, was nothing but 
a tabloid rumor for a couple 

years 
but 
made 
headlines 
with 
Lemonade 
and 
was 
only further made concrete 
when 4:44 arrived in 2017. 
With 
4:44, 
Jay-Z 
brought 
his flaws to the forefront, 
admitting his guilt and asking 
for forgiveness. Who knows 
what happened between the 
two superstars behind closed 
doors, but it seems to them 
the highest form of therapy is 
making music together. And 
with the unannounced drop of 
EVERYTHING IS LOVE, this 
unorthodox trilogy of healing 
has its final act.
EVERYTHING 
IS 
LOVE 

represents 
a 
synthesis 
of 
Beyoncé’s perfect pop formula 
and Jay-Z’s classical brand of 
rap, but instead of being the 
lavish pairing we have come 
to expect, it comes across as a 
controlled mess. The couple’s 
undying love is at the center of 
the album, but the music itself 
has no heart — there’s no sonic 
flow as the tracklist jumps 
from a sexy string symphony 
to trap-inspired synth banger 
or songs that sound less like 
collaborations and more like 
Magna Carta Holy Grail or 4 
leftovers.
If anything, one of the few 
consistent musical takeaways 
from the album is that Beyoncé 
has cemented herself as a good 
rapper, sometimes outshining 
Jay-Z in terms of technical 
ability. She borrows the triplet 
flow on “APESHIT,” trades bars 
with Pharrell on “NICE” and 
poetically chides her husband 
on “LOVEHAPPY.” “You fucked 
up the first stone, we had to get 
remarried,” raps Bey, almost 
certainly looking at Jay dead 
in the eyes in the booth. In this 
way, EVERYTHING IS LOVE 
comes across as Beyoncé album 
that happens to feature Jay-Z 
on every track, as he functions 
more as afterthought than equal 
collaborator. His contributions 
are fewer and further between 
than those of his wife, and his 
verses occupy the portions of 
any given instrumental at its 
barest; Beyoncé is backed by 
a soulful chorus on “BOSS” 
while Jay-Z is left to work with 
snare drums and a singular 
background 
vocalist. 
When 
Jay-Z flips off the NFL and 

tells them “You need me, I don’t 
need you” on “APESHIT,” it’s 
almost if Beyoncé could say the 
same to her husband himself.
There’s something off about 
this new version of Beyoncé, 
though, as she brags about 
Lamborghinis 
and 
Patek 
Philippe watches on a verse 
clearly written by Offset of 
the Migos (him and Quavo 
lend their ad-libbing talent 
to “APESHIT”), and her flow 
perfectly matches Pharrell’s on 
“NICE,” leaving you wondering 
if he just didn’t give her half of 
his verse. In fact, there’s this 
whole manufactured quality 
of EVERYTHING IS LOVE 
that 
makes 
this 
meditative 
masquerade sound artificial. 
Each 
song 
rests 
on 
the 
shoulders of a veritable army of 
songwriters and producers: Ty 
Dolla $ign, Cool & Dre and Boi-
1da, to name a few.
Beyoncé and Jay-Z are so in 
control of their public images 
that it should come as no 
surprise they recruited such 
talent to bring this album to life. 
However, facts like that make 
this celebration of their love 
seem hollow. The convenient 
rollout of EVERYTHING IS 
LOVE and the two preceding 
solo albums, along with the 
On the Run II Tour, makes 
the inner conspiracy theorist 
in me wonder if the whole 
saga of Jay-Z’s affair (except 
Solange whooping Jay’s ass 
in an elevator) was nothing 
more than a carefully crafted 
publicity stunt to drive album 
sales and Tidal subscriptions.
Ironically, the best moments 
of EVERYTHING IS LOVE 

comes when it relaxes its precise 
focus on the power couple. 
Album 
highlight 
“BLACK 
EFFECT” is a love letter to their 
own Blackness and acceptance 
of the symbolic power they 
have 
in 
their 
community. 
Jay-Z aims to uplift, shouting 
out “I’m good on any MLK 
Boulevard” and demonstrating 
the power of unity. The video 
for “APESHIT” is similarly 
empowering; the two have the 
fuck-you money to rent out 
the Louvre for one night and 
use it as their personal artistic 
playground, 
juxtaposing 
successful Black artists like 
themselves and their team of 
dancers with perhaps the most 
recognizable 
collection 
of 
white art on the planet. Jay-Z 
props himself before The Raft 
of the Medusa, a rarity among 
famous paintings as a Black 
man is at the pinnacle of the 
composition, 
while 
Beyoncé 
dances in front of the Mona 
Lisa and Winged Victory of 
Samothrace, placing herself as 
the new ideal of beauty among 
those classical notions.
Yet, 
without 
the 
visuals 
for “APESHIT,” the song is 
nothing more than an elevated 
trap anthem, as the lyrics give 
no hint of its take on high 
art. And this identity crisis is 
representative of the whole 
album itself: While it attempts 
to shape Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s 
love, 
success 
and 
passion 
into a jubilant meditation on 
Black excellence, it celebrates 
Carter 
excellence 
instead. 
Albeit 
tastefully 
opulent, 
EVERYTHING IS LOVE can’t 
shake its extravagant vanity.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Summer Senior Arts Editor

The 
thing 
you 
need 
to 
know about Shawn Mendes 
is that he was a Vine kid. 
More 
importantly, 
he 
was 
one of those Vine kids who 
didn’t use the platform for 
tormenting 
unsuspecting 
parents or siblings, but rather 
used it mostly for showcasing 
musical talents that would have 
otherwise 
remained 
hidden. 
Armed with an acoustic guitar 
and a wide smile, Mendes 
would post short clips of him 
covering various Ed Sheeran, 
One Direction and 5 Seconds 
of Summer songs (and even a 
Beyoncé track thrown in here 
and there). His rise to fame 
started here, under the pastel 
green curl of Vine’s logo, vocals 
restricted to bite-sized, five-
second long segments.
It’s a shallow personability 
that has remained constant 
throughout his music, even as 

Mendes stepped away from 
Vine, 
entered 
into 
record 
contracts and started releasing 
original albums. His songs lack 
substance, depth or dynamism, 
instead just minute variations 
on the same easily-consumable, 
bred-for-radio sound that has 
been 
recycled 
throughout 
generations of generic pop stars 
from Ed Sheeran to Charlie 
Puth. And it isn’t a bad sound 
— catchy hooks and predictable 
melodies 
are 
easy 
to 
sing 
along to when you’re stuck in 
bad traffic — but it’s one that 
lacks originality; music that 
never goes beyond established 
constraints.
Shawn 
Mendes’s 
newest 
single, “Lost In Japan” follows 
the same formula — easily 
memorable 
“Can’t 
get 
you 
off my mind” a bow on top 
of 
the 
whole 
shiny, 
auto-
tune slathered chorus — only 
with an “edgy” R&B twist. 
Rather 
than 
authentic, 
the 
dancing synth and energetic 

tempo’s upbeat pulse are only 
reminiscent of Calvin Harris’s 
Funk Wav Bounces Vol.1, and 
Shawn Mendes finds himself 
continuing to rip off those who 
came before him.
To be fair, Mendes is not a 
bad artist. His vocal range is 
astounding, 
natural 
falsetto 
reaches add texture to every 
lackluster 
melody 
and, 
as 
he jumps from the smooth 
crescendo of the chorus into the 
abrupt “I could feel the tension 
/ We could cut it with a knife” of 
verse one, Mendes is graceful, 
never allowing the delicate 
warmth of his voice to falter.
“Lost In Japan” is nothing 
new. Similar to the breezy 
triviality of what came before 
it — songs like “There’s Nothing 
Holding You Back” or “Treat 
You Better” — the single’s best 
feature is its consumerism — the 
nearly universal sentiment that 
can be found within Mendes’s 
manufactured 
confession 
of 
love. 

‘Lost in Japan’ a false, 
manufactured charm

Human Rights Commission calls for AAPD accountability

SAM SO / DAILY
Ann Arbor residents gather at the Human Rights Commission meeting to discuss the formation of a review board for the AAPD at Ann Arbor City Hall January 10, 2018.

Seventy Ann Arbor residents 
called for increased accountability 
and transparency from the Ann 
Arbor Police Department at the Ann 
Arbor Human Rights Commission 
Wednesday. This comes after several 
local incidents of police brutality, 
and institutional responses many 
residents view as insufficient.
Because of the unprecedented 
number of residents in attendance, 
a member of the fire department 
stopped by on an anonymous tip to 
move the HRC to the City Council 
Workroom. 
Participants 
carried 
signs with slogans such as “Civilian 
Police Review Now!” and “No false 
solutions.”
Difficulties with relations between 
the AAPD and the Ann Arbor 
community erupted in 2014 when an 
AAPD officer shot and killed 40-year-

old Aura Rosser, a Black woman, after 
the officer claimed Rosser had moved 
towards him with a knife. 
Rosser’s death was not the only 
example of the AAPD’s questionable 
use of force. Since Rosser’s death, 
numerous incidents such as the 
violent arrest of Ciaeem Slaton at 
the Blake Transit Center, the rough 
handling of University of Michigan 
student Dyshon Toxey and alleged 
mistreatment 
of 
several 
Black 
students during tailgates have led 
residents to question whether these 
are issues of race and how the AAPD 
can be held accountable for their 
actions.
Residents have reacted to the 
tenuous relationship between the 
police and citizens through various 
protests and initiatives calling for 
a new way of policing the AAPD. 
While the Ann Arbor City Council 
initially responded to the uproar in 
early 2017 by approving a $200,000 

contract with a consulting firm, 
Hillard Heintze LLC, many residents 
considered the unsatisfying, and even 
counteractive. 
Long-time Ann Arbor resident 
Shirley Beckley expressed frustration 
with the long-standing impasse in 
relations with AAPD.
“This is not a problem we should 
still be struggling with,” she said. “We 
should not still be struggling with 
issues from the 1970s.”
She addressed City Administrator 
Howard Lazarus later in the meeting.
“I don’t trust you,” she stated. “I 
don’t trust the police. No one has 
apologized for killing Aura Rosser. 
Not yet. But you ask us to trust you. 
Trust is earned.”
Transforming Justice Washtenaw, 
a group that advocates for restorative 
alternatives 
to 
policing 
and 
incarceration, opened the HRC 
meeting with members Lori Saginaw 
and Julie Quiroz reading a statement 

they sent to the mayor, City Council, 
city administrator and HRC prior 
to the meeting. The statement 
requested the formation of a Civilian 
Police Review Board instead of the 
“Co-Produced Policing Committee” 
the city is pursuing. 
“We call on the Ann Arbor City 
Council to take immediate steps 
directing the city administrator 
to put in place a Civilian Police 
Review Board that is independent, 
transparent, 
representative 
and 
adequately funded, based on the 
specific features outlined below. This 
CPRB should be in place no later than 
January 2019,” Saginaw said.
Several HRC members, including 
Dwight Wilson, shared a sense of 
urgency.
“We need to stop dancing around 
and just do this. We have all kinds 
of people telling us to do it, and even 
if we didn’t, common sense should 
tell us that we need to protect the 

citizens,” Wilson said.
The HRC formally proposed a 
CPRB a year after Rosser’s death in 
2015, and again with a unanimous 
statement in July 2016. AAPD chief 
Jim Baird, on the other hand, blasted 
the idea in the summer of 2016, 
arguing 
implementing 
oversight 
before a third-party review would be 
too hasty. 
“Because the commission’s report 
blends the national discussion with 
the Rosser incident, I have concern 
that there may be an appetite to 
address national issues and concerns 
with local policy,” Baird wrote 
in a memo. “To presume that the 
Ann Arbor Police Department’s 
practices are not ‘positive’ and that 
a review board is the best way to 
‘ensure future adherence’ absent 
any supporting reference is ill 
advised...(civilian oversight) becomes 
a mechanism for people who are 
sometimes 
disenchanted 
with 

police departments to become more 
disenchanted, because all they see is 
the problem.”
Throughout the meeting residents 
emphasized the importance of a 
review board comprised of residents 
rather than the Hillard Heinze 
proposed 
Co-Produced 
Policing, 
which would include commissioners, 
policemen and council members.
Similarly, 
residents 
expressed 
doubt regarding the effectivity of a 
CPPC. The CPPC cannot conduct 
investigations and can only review 
from outside investigations via the 
AAPD’s Office of Internal Affairs, 
working as a third-party liaison 
between the public and the police. 
The residents argued a Civilian Police 
Review Board would take a more 
direct approach.

Teen arrested at Blake Transit 
Center, sparks local uproar

Family seeking an apology 
after a 16-year-old Black boy was 
arrested at the Blake Transit 
Center Tuesday night. The incident 
was first reported in a press release 
from the Collective Against White 
Supremacy.
The press release detailed an 
incident where Ciaeem Slaton, a 
student at Pathways to Success 
Academic Campus in Ann Arbor, 
was reportedly confronted by an 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
officer while waiting for a bus. 
The officer, who is also Black, 
demanded to see Slaton and his 
friends’ school ID cards, though 
they had not received their physical 
IDs from the school yet. After 
the initial encounter, the officer 
reportedly dragged Slaton by his 
backpack into the station.
An accompanying video shows 
Slaton being arrested while other 
teens tell Slaton to comply with the 
arrest.
“The officer drew his taser 
which appears to be pointed at 
Slaton,” the press release read. 
“After the video, Ciaeem was given 
a ‘trespass’ charge, which means 
he is not allowed to use the Ann 
Arbor or Ypsilanti busses or be at 
the bus station for an entire year.”
Slaton was released from police 
custody while still at the bus 
station.
The Slaton family is asking for an 
apology from AAPD and the officer 
in question for the arrest. They are 
also asking for compensation for 
Slaton’s reported physical injuries 
and for his charges to be dropped. 

According to the release, Slaton 
needs to use the bus system to get 
to school — as a result, the Slaton 
family sees the trespass charge as 
unfair to his education.
According to MLive, Jim Baird, 
the Ann Arbor Police Chief, wrote 
an email to Ann Arbor City Council 
and explained the video footage 
took place before the arrival of 
additional police officers.
“Any use of force by Ann Arbor 
Police 
Department 
personnel 
receives a review at three levels 
in the organization,” he wrote. 
“In addition, because some of 
the inquiries I received could be 
characterized as complaints, a 
personnel complaint has been 
initiated and will be investigated 
by our professional standards 
section.”
Anna Lemler, a University alum 
and organizer with Collective 
Against White Supremacy, said 
CAWS has reached out to Slaton’s 
mother for support; they have 
offered to help with grocery 
shopping, contacting media outlets 
and raising funds for legal costs. 
Lemler said there were officers 
stationed in the area surrounding 
the Transit Center to respond 
to a fight that happened earlier. 
Lemler said she thinks that is why 
there was a larger police presence, 
though she believes there are 
usually one or two AAPD cops 
stationed there that are hired by 
the Transit Center.
“It sounds like there was some 
high energy because of that fight 
and so he got there for a different 
reason, to take the bus home, and 
the cop said, ‘You need to leave,’” 
she said. “So he started to walk 

away from the crowd and the cop 
came up and approached him 
again, and that’s when he asked for 
his ID.”
Lemler 
said 
it 
is 
her 
understanding that because Slaton 
was asked to leave, he was charged 
with trespassing.
“I didn’t understand how he’s 
trespassing as a resident of Ann 
Arbor in a public bus station, 
waiting for a bus to go home, but it’s 
because the officer had said that he 
needed to go, that because he didn’t 
(leave) quick enough or something, 
that’s what the trespass charge is,” 
she said.
She explained because Slaton 
didn’t have his ID, the officer did 
not know that he was a minor.
“Even though he’s a Black 
cop, he is still an individual that, 
by his profession, is trained in 
policies and practices that are 
institutionally racist and target 
youths of color,” she said. “Even 
though he’s Black, doesn’t mean 
this isn’t a part of institutional 
racism. These young people at the 
Transit Center are harassed all the 
time by cops and by security there 
so this is a repeated issue ... Ann 
Arbor is full of white liberalism, 
and I am white, and I think many 
white folks in particular want to 
believe that racism doesn’t exist 
here, but it definitely does.”
Protests against police brutality 
have been prevalent in Ann Arbor 
since the 2014 shooting of Aura 
Rosser. Rosser, a Black woman 
with a mental illness, was killed by 
an Ann Arbor police officer.

Black students speak out against 
overpolicing in Ann Arbor

University of Michigan student 
Dyshon Toxey doesn’t smile much 
anymore. 
An 
LSA 
senior, 
Toxey 
is 
finishing his degree in cognitive 
science and mathematics, and 
is involved in a number of 
development programs for fellow 
first-generation students. Toxey is 
Black, and said he often took pride 
in his perfectly straight, groomed 
set of teeth to build connections 
in Black circles and beyond — he’s 
known as a community mentor 
with an easygoing demeanor and 
an even easier smile. 
That is, he was until last 
April, when Toxey was detained, 
body slammed and handcuffed 
outside 
Hill 
Auditorium 
for 
alleged disorderly conduct at the 
SpringFest concert headlined by 
Migos.
Toxey recounted event staff 
asking him and his friends — all 
Black students — to fill in the 
front rows of the concert, then 
being asked by security guards 
to leave shortly thereafter. When 
a white Ann Arbor police officer 
attempted 
to 
grab 
ahold 
of 
him, Toxey, who admits he was 
intoxicated, said he panicked. 
“I ran,” he said. “There was 
no one to protect me, no one was 
videotaping. I really was not 
trying to get into an altercation.”
When Toxey came to a stop near 
the Panera on North University 
Avenue, he said the officer threw 
him to the ground and kneed him 
in the back, knocking a tooth out 
and spraining Toxey’s wrist in 

the process. Toxey said he was 
later transported to the University 
Hospital and released hours later, 
with stitches, crutches and a bill 
totaling nearly $7,000 in medical 
fees. The University’s Division of 
Public Security and Safety notes 
the case as closed in its crime 
log. Toxey, the report details, was 
taken to the emergency room for 
“treatment of injuries sustained 
during a fall when he was fleeing.”
Despite 
protests 
from 
his 
parents, Toxey didn’t inquire into 
his record; he wanted to brush the 
incident aside, take his final exams 
and return to his family and home 
in Harlem, New York. He said 
he was never notified about his 
charges again.
“(The cop) kept saying, ‘I told 
you not to run,’ ” Toxey said. “ ‘I 
told you not to run.’ And then I 
never heard anything from them 
again.” 
A few other Black students 
who were present at the concert 
corroborate Toxey’s account, but 
they agree on more than just his 
take on the night’s events. Toxey’s 
fate was not surprising to them. 
The Black community on campus 
and in Ann Arbor, many students 
claim, is more frequently and 
aggressively policed in student 
life than other demographics at 
the University. More stringent 
law 
enforcement, 
then, 
does 
little to close the gap between 
Black students’ lives outside of 
the classroom and mainstream 
perceptions 
of 
the 
glorified 
Michigan experience.
Many lament that few qualifiers 
can 
spare 
Black 
students, 
especially Black men. For all of 

LSA freshman Rashan Gary’s 
acclaim as a highly recruited 
defensive tackle on the football 
team, he said he witnessed similar 
stereotyping while interviewing 
an Ann Arbor Police Department 
officer for a class project on 
community relations. The cop 
said, if he had seen Gary, 6’5” feet 
tall and 287 pounds, on the street 
late at night without context, he’d 
have reason to be scared.
“He was straight up about 
it, that I could be dangerous or 
something,” Gary said.
The suspicion is then often 
institutionalized. As recently as 
two weeks ago, in a carjacking 
case in downtown Ann Arbor, 
AAPD Detective Lt. Matt Lige told 
MLive the suspect was described 
as “a light-skinned black male.” 
The department arrested a white 
17 year old for the crime three days 
later.
Elizabeth 
James, 
program 
associate 
director 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Afroamerican 
and African Studies, pointed to 
the mistaken identity case as a 
microcosm of larger systemic 
issues 
in 
local 
forces. 
The 
discrepancy in policing, she said, 
is something she’s been aware of 
since she began working in Ann 
Arbor in the early ’90s.
“What do we do with our 
tall men … or our darker men?” 
she asked. “There’s a double 
consciousness for Black students 
that’s always resting on your 
shoulder. Your party’s going to be 
shut down … even when it’s in the 
(Michigan) Union. You’ve got to 
walk more delicately, and you 
have to be twice as good.”

City to tackle deer overpopulation

Earlier this week, 
Ann Arbor City Council 
introduced its 2018 deer 
management plan to the 
public. The city aims to 
eliminate up to 250 deer 
from Jan. 8 to Jan. 31 in 
the third year of its four-
year deer management 
program. This is a large 
increase from winter 2017, 
when the city aimed to 
eliminate up to 100 deer.
Furthermore, the 
plan states that up to 26 
deer will be nonlethally 
sterilized between Jan. 
2 and 7. Last year they 
planned to sterilize up to 
60 deer and sterilized 54.
The program began out 
of resident complaints 
about deer harming their 
properties.
Like last year, the 
lethal portion of the plan 
will be carried out by 
sharpshooters through 
the city’s contractor, 
White Buffalo Inc. It will 
comply with the Michigan 
Department of Natural 
Resources research permit. 
During the elimination, 
select public parks and 
private properties will 
be closed from 3 p.m. to 
midnight Jan. 8 through 
Jan. 31. The Nichols 
Arboretum is expected to 
be closed on Jan 9, 16, 19 
and 23; however, it must 
first be approved by the 
University of Michigan.
Additionally, other 
University and Concordia 
University properties will 
potentially be shut down 
Jan. 8 through Jan. 31, 
pending authorization. 
In previous years, the 
University has agreed to 
allow the cull to take place 
on University property.
According to the 
implementation plan 
released by the city, the 
sharpshooting may only 
occur from a parked 
vehicle, and shooting on 

the city-selected private 
property will not occur 
without the owner’s 
consent.
The city will post signs 
regarding the closure in 
parks and nature areas 
that will be affected by 
the program at least 24 
hours before the three-
week process begins. 
Residents living adjacent 
to any of these areas will 
be notified via postcard by 
the end of the month. They 
will also use social media 
and other new outlets to 
inform residents of the 
sterilization program.
This is the second year 

the plan includes the 
sterilization of deer, which 
will also carried out by 
White Buffalo. The process 
involves darting the female 
deer, temporarily removing 
them from the area, 
surgically sterilizing them 
and returning them to the 
park. The process will take 
approximately an hour per 
deer, and is not expected to 
disturb residents.
The city is in need for 
volunteers to aid in the 
sterilization, an effort 
that will save many deer. 
The volunteers assist in 
tasks such as monitoring 
vitals during the surgery 
and returning the deer to 
their original location. 

There will be two shifts 
of volunteers throughout 
the nights, and they will 
work six to seven hours 
per shift, with the first 
beginning at 4 p.m. and the 
second ending at 5 a.m., 
from Jan. 2 to Jan 5 or 6. 
Each volunteer will be 
required to work at least 
two shifts, and food will be 
provided.
Christopher Dick, 
ecology and evolutionary 
biology professor, 
discussed the importance 
of the cull at a recent 
community council 
meeting.
“If we are able to reduce 
Ann Arbor’s urban deer 
population to a more 
sustainable level — by 
sustainable, I mean a deer 
abundance that permits 
natural forest regeneration 
— this will have an 
immediate positive impact 
on our natural areas,” Dick 
said. “The herd reduction 
will help to stave the 
spread of ticks that carry 
diseases such as Lyme 
disease. Black-legged ticks 
and Lyme disease have 
recently been documented 
in Washtenaw County.”
Despite the city saying 
the deer cull is necessary, 
the implementation of 
this program has been a 
controversial topic in the 
community for many years.
Among those against the 
cull is LSA senior Aaron 
Brodkey, president of the 
Michigan Animal Respect 
Society. He told The Daily 
earlier this year that he felt 
it was wrong for humans to 
intervene in nature. 
“Personally, I just think 
it’s maybe wrong or rash 
to make this decision,” 
Brodkey said in January. 
“I feel like we’re taking 
it into our own hands 
and playing God in this 
position and saying, ‘Hey, 
we need to massacre 100 
deer for who knows what 
reason?’”

Ann Arbor police chief 
to transfer to Colorado 
ski town 

After 
25 
years 
with 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department — the last 
two as the head of the 
department 
— 
Police 
Chief Jim Baird will be 
relocating to Breckenridge, 
Colo., according to the 
Summit Daily of Summit 
County, 
Colo. 
Howard 
Lazarus, Ann Arbor city 
administrator announced 
Baird’s retirement from 
the AAPD Tuesday at the 
City 
Council 
meeting, 
though 
not 
where 
he 
would be relocating. 
“I will leave it up to 
him to share as he deems 
appropriate 
what 
life’s 
next great adventure is, 
but we will be preparing 
for an orderly turnover 
and transition,” Lazarus 
said. “We all wish the 
chief well as he chases 
what lies around the curb 
and the trail.”
Baird, 
who 
currently 
lives in Stockbridge, will 
officially step down on 
March 24, at which point 
Robert 
Pfannes, 
AAPD 
deputy police chief, will 
take over as interim chief. 
Baird will begin the job in 
Breckenridge on April 23.
Breckenridge, a town 
known for its ski resorts, 
has 
a 
population 
of 
approximately 
5,000, 
much smaller than Ann 
Arbor’s population of about 

120,000. However, due to 
the town’s large tourism 
industry, thousands more 
can flow in on short notice 
–– circumstances Baird 
compared 
to 
football 
games at the University of 
Michigan.
“From what I’m hearing, 
on Breckenridge’s busiest 
days, the town will swell 
up 
to 
30,000 
people,” 
Baird told the Summit 
Daily. “For a home game, 
the University of Michigan 
Stadium in Ann Arbor 
holds over three times 
that. So that difference in 
scale will be significant.”
Baird’s 
departure 
comes 
as 
the 
city 
is 
considering the creation 
of a police review board 
that would review and 
potentially 
investigate 
complaints 
against 
the 
department. In a 2016 
memo to City Council, 
Baird 
said 
he 
would 
oppose implementation of 
such a board unless it was 
recommended by a third-
party audit of the AAPD. 
In February 2017, the city 
hired the Chicago-based 
security 
firm, 
Hillard 
Heintze to conduct such 
an audit, though residents 
have been highly critical 
of the firm’s methods and 
its members’ long careers 
with 
law 
enforcement 
agencies.
Baird 
could 
not 
be 
reached for comment at the 
time of this publication.

Ann Arbor City Council kneels during pledge

The 
national 
spotlight 
placed on the debate over 
kneeling during the national 
anthem was brought Monday 
night to the Ann Arbor City 
Council, 
as 
four 
council 
members knelt during the 
Pledge of Allegiance.
Council 
members 
Jason 
Frenzel, Sumi Kailasapathy, 
Chip 
Smith 
and 
Chuck 
Warpehoski 
all 
knelt 
in 
silent 
protest 
during 
the 
Pledge of Allegiance, which 
is traditionally said prior to 
every City Council meeting.
Warpehoski 
announced 
his intention to kneel during 
the 
pledge 
prior 
to 
the 
council meeting in a post on 
his website. In that post, he 
compared kneeling during 
the pledge to kneeling during 
a football game for an injured 
player. 
“I can’t speak to what is in 
each person’s heart, but for 
me to ‘take a knee’ is an act of 
attention, of concern, and of 

respect. And it is in that spirit 
that I take a knee at tonight’s 
City 
Council 
meeting,” 
Warpehoski wrote.
In 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
council meeting designated 
for 
announcements 
from 
the 
council 
members, 
Kailasapathy explained why 
she joined Warpehoski in 
kneeling. 
“For 
me 
democracy 
is 
more than just symbolic, 
it’s 
actually 
holding 
up 
democratic 
practices,” 
Kailasapathy said. “I would 
want others to judge my 
patriotism by my actions 
when I uphold these values.”
Following the protests, the 
council members returned to 
their scheduled business. 
The most pressing issue was 
the vote on the approval of 
more funds for the third year 
of Ann Arbor’s controversial 
deer-culling 
efforts. 
The 
resolution 
on 
the 
table 
would approve an additional 
$110,000 to completely fund 
the estimated 2018 budget of 
$370,000 to be spent on the 

deer cull.
The program, which began 
in 2015, was designed to help 
deal with the overpopulation 
of deer in the Ann Arbor 
area. 
Eight 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents spoke in the public 
commentary about the deer 
cull. University of Michigan 
professor Christopher Dick 
spoke in support of the cull, 
saying it was necessary for 
the health of the deer and the 
forests they lived in.
“Culling 
the 
herd 
can 
actually 
help 
the 
dear 
by 
reducing 
the 
spread 
of 
deer 
diseases 
that 
may 
be 
exacerbated 
by 
overabundance,” Dick said. 
Other speakers, such as 
Ann Arbor resident Robert 
McGee, attempted to rebut 
the point that deer posed any 
extraordinary threat to the 
wildlife and forests of Ann 
Arbor, or to its citizens. 
Ann Arbor resident Sally 
Daniels went a step further 
and criticized the council for 
its past and current support 
of the deer cull.

“Council 
members 
have 
based their vote on their own 
limited experiences rather 
than the wishes of their 
constituents,” Daniels said. 
“A deer ran on top of council 
member Kailasapathy’s car. 
Will killing 558 more deer 
make her feel better?”
She concluded her remarks 
by saying, “everyone who 
votes for an increase in the 
cull tonight deserves to be 
voted off of City Council.”
In a vote of 10-1, the 
council voted in favor of the 
additional funds needed for 
the 2018 deer cull, with Mayor 
Christopher Taylor being the 
sole dissenting voice.
The 
council 
members 
also took time to vote on a 
resolution 
to 
decline 
pay 
increases in their salaries. 
The council rejected this 
resolution, 
accepting 
the 
pay increase. The council 
also declared the month of 
October Co-op Month in the 
city of Ann Arbor in honor of 
the work local co-ops do for 
the community.

Councilmembers sue 
city over Library Lot deal

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Councilmembers 
Sumi 
Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, and 
Anne 
Bannister, 
D-Ward 
1, 
have sued the city of Ann Arbor, 
Mayor Christopher Taylor and 
City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry 
over a $10 million deal regarding 
the development of Library Lot. 
The contract, signed by Taylor, 
Beaudry 
and 
Chicago-based 
developer Core Spaces on May 
31, hands over the development 
rights of Library Lot, a parking 
area next to the Ann Arbor 
District Library where Core 
Spaces plans to construct a 
17-story high-rise called the 
Collective.
Attorney 
Eric 
Lipson 
filed the lawsuit on behalf of 
Kailasapathy 
and 
Bannister 
June 18 in the Washtenaw 
County Trial Court. The lawsuit 
accuses Taylor and Beaudry of 
violating Ann Arbor’s charter by 
signing a development contract 
without first consulting City 
Council. The council voted 
8-3 to sell Library Lot in April 
2017 to Core Spaces, but the 
purchase was not finalized until 
this year. The lawsuit claims the 
May 31 contract finalizing the 
purchase was not presented to 
City Council.
According to Kailasapathy, 
the Ann Arbor City Charter 
requires purchases or sales 
valued over $25,000 to be 

approved by at least eight 
councilmembers. 
She 
said 
the language of the charter is 
clear and she therefore feels 
confident about the strength of 
her and Bannister’s case.
“In plain English, it says 
a contract has to come, and 
there’s 
no 
way 
they 
can 
say there was a contract 13 
months before because there 
was no contract, there was a 
resolution,” Kailasapathy said.
Kailasapathy 
claimed 
she 
and Bannister sued the city 
to protect the interests of 
their constituents. Ann Arbor 
voters trust the City Council 
to represent their interests, 
Kailasapathy 
said, 
so 
the 
council must get a say in 
financial decisions.
“Anne Bannister and I, we 
represent Ward 1,” Kailasapathy 
said. “Our residents, they do like 
people to have financial oversight 
over the city’s business.”
She added the authority of the 
charter needs to be respected 
because it maintains checks and 
balances within city government 
and provides order.
“I 
look 
at 
rules 
and 
regulations 
very 
seriously,” 
Kailasapathy 
said. 
“If 
City 
Council itself doesn’t follow its 
charter, how do we expect the 
residents of Ann Arbor to follow 
our charter and ordinances?”

AAPD works to increase diversity among staff

According to a recent study 
of 
demographics 
within 
the 
Ann Arbor Police Department, 
the demographics of the city’s 
police force do not match those 
of the Ann Arbor community. 
In a city that is 69 percent white 
according to a 2010 census, a 
surveyconducted earlier this year 
shows the AAPD is 87 percent 
white or Caucasian.
Several 
members 
of 
the 
AAPD explained the lack of 
diversity within the department 
seems to be the result of an even 
greater lack of diversity within 
the pool of graduates from the 
police 
academy. 
Lieutenant 
Mike Scherba said in the state 
of Michigan, about 97 percent of 
the academy graduates are white 
males.
“What we found traditionally 
is that those coming out of the 
police academy in this area are 
white males and the tentative pool 
for the police department is then 
obviously primarily white males,” 
Scherba said. “As a result, we had 
to then look and think: ‘How do 
we better represent the diversity 
within our city?’”
A 
need 
for 
diversity 
representative 
of 
the 
Ann 
Arbor populace has also been 
emphasized due to recent racially-
charged incidents in AAPD, such 
as the shooting of Aura Rosser 
in 2014 and the violent arrest 
of high school student Ciaeem 
Slaton in September, leading Ann 
Arbor citizens to call for increased 

transparency in the AAPD as well 
as a police review board. At an 
October rally in support of Slaton, 
Ann Arbor resident DaQuann 
Harrison 
said 
the 
incidents 
involving Slaton and Rosser –– 
both Black residents of the city 
–– were representative of a larger 
problem that existed in Ann Arbor 
as well as the rest of the country.
“(Ciaeem) is one of many youth 
of color who are targeted by police 
in here,” he said. “His situation 
is also one of many that has 
historically appeared here in Ann 
Arbor.” 
Members 
of 
minority 
communities at the University 
of Michigan as well, including 
Rackham student Javier Solorzano 
Parada, 
have 
experienced 
a 
lack 
of 
communication 
and 
understanding with AAPD that 
they feel is not on par with the 
relationship between the police 
and white student communities. 
When students were arrested at 
a tailgate hosted by Solorzano 
Parada’s former fraternity, which 
is predominantly Latino, he said 
officers provided no explanation.
“Communication is key with 
communities of color, and you 
need to tell us it’s not about race 
but safety, or size or whatever 
reason you may have,” he said. 
“And if I’m scared after all these 
years here, what must it be like 
for an undergraduate student? 
Or a first-generation student? We 
shouldn’t have to be afraid of the 
police. We shouldn’t have to live 
in fear.”
To combat the discrepancy 
between 
the 
community 

demographics and the lack of 
diversity within the AAPD, the 
department has responded by 
seeking to recruit a wider pool 
of candidates through extending 
their recruiting radius. Sergeant 
Jaime 
Crawford 
from 
the 
recruiting and hiring unit of the 
AAPD explained the department 
is actively looking for candidates 
from all over Michigan.
“We 
are 
really 
trying 
to 
broaden where we are recruiting 
from and the type of events we 
are attending,” Crawford said. “In 
the past, it was easier to recruit 
inasmuch as we didn’t have to 
do much because people were 
seeking out law enforcement as a 
career, and now that has changed 
so we are really trying to attend 
events at universities and we are 
going into more urban areas.”
Crawford 
said 
AAPD 
has 
begun recruiting at many colleges 
throughout the state, attending 
career fairs at the University 
of Detroit Mercy, Wayne State 
University, Ferris State University, 
Michigan 
State 
University 
and Mott Community College. 
Recruiters like Crawford seek to 
identify good candidates — even 
those who might not be ready 
to apply for several years — in 
order to develop awareness of 
opportunities within AAPD.
“We want to expose them 
to what the Ann Arbor Police 
Department 
is 
all 
about,” 
Crawford said. “We are highly 
regarded within the state and 
among other police departments 
so we really want to pull them in 
early and let them know what we 

have to offer.”
Part of how AAPD goes about 
recruiting is through maintaining 
diversity within the recruiting 
staff.
“We try to have diversity in our 
recruiters,” Crawford said. “Just 
so that the representatives we 
have from the Ann Arbor Police 
Department 
are 
approachable 
and can answer any questions or 
concerns that potential candidates 
might have. As a female, I get a lot 
of questions from females that are 
curious to know what it’s like in 
this field.”
Crawford went on to explain 
that while it is obviously a male-
dominated environment, she has 
been afforded every opportunity.
“My experience with Ann 
Arbor has been phenomenal,” 
Crawford said.
Alongside pursuing potential 
candidates at universities, AAPD 
has also initiated a sponsorship 
program as another mode of 
promoting diversity. The program 
allows the city to assume the cost 
of the candidate attending the 
academy with the promise that 
when they graduate, they become 
an officer in AAPD. This has been 
helpful as Crawford said the 
academy itself can be a roadblock 
for potential candidates. It can 
be difficult for some to attend the 
academy due to the cost, which 
is about $7,000, combined with 
the fact students in the academy 
don’t have time to work during the 
training process.

Council approves new 
code for Greek housing

At the Monday meeting, 
the Ann Arbor City Council 
approved changes to the 
zoning 
code 
for 
Greek 
life houses and moved to 
postpone the approval of a 
new development plan for 
the northern part of the city. 
City 
Council 
voted 
unanimously 
to 
approve 
new zoning for fraternity 
and sorority houses, which 
modifies 
the 
definition 
of 
“fraternity” 
and 
“sorority” and requires the 
organizations 
to 
affiliate 
themselves 
with 
the 
University or another higher 
education institution.
Mayor Christopher Taylor 
commented 
the 
changes 
will 
improve 
Greek 
life 
organizations’ interactions 
with Ann Arbor residents.
“Our goal is to more 
accurately 
increase 
the 
likelihood that fraternities 
and 
sororities 
are 
good 
neighbors 
to 
everyone,” 
Taylor said. “In many cases 
they 
are. 
Occasionally 
they are not. I think this 
ordinance change will give 
us the opportunity to do 
something about it in that 
minority case.”
Though the changes do 
not 
retroactively 
apply 
to 
existing 
Greek 
life 
organizations 
and 
the 
new 
zoning 
rules 
will 
only apply to new Greek 
life organizations seeking 
a 
permit 
or 
established 
organizations 
looking 
to 
expand, neighbors of Greek 
life houses as well as Greek 
life alumni came forward to 
discuss the proposal.
Anne Schreiber, an Ann 
Arbor resident whose house 
is surrounded by fraternity 
and sorority houses, was 
in support of the proposal, 
saying while some of the 
organization 
members 
are good neighbors, many 
fraternities 
in 
particular 
cause disturbances.
“There are an awful lot 
of people that are very 
unhappy 
with 
the 
way 
they (fraternities) behave,” 
Schreiber said. “They are 
unruly, 
they 
are 
noisy, 
they’re 
dirty 
— 
lots 
of 
garbage and papers and 
stuff. And I don’t think 
we should give them any 
more latitude. I think if 
anything we need to restrict 
them and give them some 
parameters. It seems like 
nobody can take ownership 
of the responsibility of their 
misbehavior.”
Peter 
Nagourney, 
the 
co-chair 
for 
the 
North 
Burns Park Association and 
neighbor to several Greek 
life 
houses, 
pointed 
out 
one neighboring residence 
housed a banned fraternity.
“You should know that 
one neighbor spent nine 
months constantly, and I 

mean daily, dealing with 
city, University police and 
Greek life entities before 
one of these party houses set 
up by members of a banned 
fraternity was shut down,” 
Nagourney said. “This is 
a real problem. Others in 
this 
neighborhood 
must 
constantly deal with trash, 
public drunkenness, loud 
music and other violations 
of city ordinances. Oversight 
of these groups is not done 
at the national level despite 
the claims of their attorneys. 
Oversight by the University 
and the Office of Greek Life 
does not seem to make much 
difference.”
Elizabeth Jove, a member 
of the house corporation 
that owns the Alpha Phi 
Sorority 
property 
and 
chapter 
adviser 
for 
the 
sorority, pushed the council 
to postpone the decision for 
approval, stressing a need 
for all voices involved to be 
heard.
“What 
we 
have 
here 
tonight 
is 
exactly 
the 
situation that will continue if 
council doesn’t let all parties 
sit and talk together because 
we’ve heard neighbors who 
have deeply held concerns 
and issues with the behavior 
of these properties, of the 
people who live on these 
properties,” 
Jove 
said. 
“This 
proposed 
zoning 
amendment is not going 
to address those issues. It 
doesn’t address trash and 
noise and parties. It doesn’t 
address the appearance of 
your properties.”
Nagourney 
disagreed, 
claiming 
Greek 
life 
organizations 
have 
previously 
not 
been 
forthcoming in responding 
to neighbors’ concerns.
“Hearing 
tonight’s 
sudden offers to work with 
the community are a joke,” 
Nagourney said. “In 20 years 
I have never heard from any 
organization about meeting 
or dealing with these issues. 
Never once. And my name’s 
been on the books for over 
20 years.”
In addition to the approval 
of the new housing code for 
fraternities and sororities, 
the council also discussed 
a new development plan 
for the Cottages at Barton 
Green.
The 
decision 
to 
postpone the new housing 
development 
by 
Trinitas 
Ventures, 
an 
Indiana 
student housing developer, 
was made following heavy 
protests 
from 
residents 
of the Pontiac Trail. The 
proposed 
development 
would range from the west 
side of Pontiac Trail and 
south of Dhu Varren Road 
and include 225 apartments 
with 716 bedrooms in 92 
buildings 
built 
on 
the 
vacant lot. Major concerns 
from 
residents 
and 
councilmembers

Candidates debate policing, campaign contributions

Six candidates for Ann Arbor 
City Council and two candidates 
 
for mayor participated in a 
forum Thursday afternoon at 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
to discuss issues relevant to the 
primary election in August. 
More than 50 students and 
community members attended 
the forum, hosted by the 
Center for Local, State, and 
Urban Policy and moderated by 
members of a Public Policy class 
on local government taught by 
former Ann Arbor Mayor John 
Hieftje.
Among other things, the 
candidates discussed mental 
health 
resources, 
transit, 
protections for undocumented 
immigrants and policing. The 
controversy over the city’s 
possible repurchase of the 
Y Lot made its way into the 
conversation more than once, 
with candidates calling into 
question each other’s’ motives 
and the degree to which they 
were influenced by campaign 
contributions.
The 
mayoral 
candidates 
present were Councilmember 
Jack Eaton, D-Ward 4, and 
incumbent Mayor Chris Taylor. 
Other 
present 
incumbent 
councilmembers included Kirk 
Westphal, D-Ward 2; Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3; Graydon 
Krapohl, 
D-Ward 
4; 
and 
Chuck Warpehoski, D-Ward 5. 
Joseph Hood, who is running 
for Council in Ward 4, and 
Ali Ramlawi, who is running 
for Council in Ward 5, also 
attended.
When 
asked 
about 
the 
influence 
of 
campaign 
contributions 
on 
decision 
making, 
the 
conversation 
quickly turned to the issue of 
the Y Lot. In 2013, the city sold 
the former site of the YMCA 
on Fifth Avenue to real estate 
developer Dennis Dahlmann. 
Stipulations in the contract 
stated if Dahlmann had not 
adequately 
developed 
the 

property for use within five 
years, the city had the option of 
repurchasing the property. Now 
five years later, the property 
has undergone no development 
while appreciating significantly 
in 
value, 
and 
several 
councilmembers have moved to 
repurchase it.
After 
failing 
to 
amass 
the eight votes required for 
repurchase in their April 2 
meeting, the council will vote 
again on the issue Monday. 
Several 
councilmembers 
in favor of the repurchase 
have accused Eaton of being 
influenced 
by 
Dahlmann’s 
campaign contributions after 
Easton 
voted 
against 
the 
repurchase. At the forum, Eaton 
said he had been criticized for 
accepting contributions from 
Dahlmann before, though the 
nature of the criticism was 
inconsistent.
“I would point out that when 
Dennis Dahlmann submitted 
the highest bid to purchase this 
property and some of us voted 
to accept the high bid, we were 
criticized for that vote because 
we had received contributions 
in the past from him,” he 
said. “So apparently anything 
that we do with regard to 
Mr. Dahlmann is subject to 
criticism, even if it makes 
complete rational sense.”
Eaton went on to point out 
the city had made previous 
attempts 
to 
develop 
the 
property 
with 
a 
separate 
developer, and when that deal 
fell 
through 
the 
developer 
sued the city, restricting any 
development on the property 
for the five-year duration of the 
lawsuit. Eaton said he voted 
against the repurchase to avoid 
lengthy litigation and instead 
come to a settlement with 
Dahlmann.
“We prevailed without any 
qualification, but it still took this 
property out of development for 
five years,” Eaton said. “Here we 
are again facing litigation that’s 
likely to take multiple years, 
and nothing will happen during 

that litigation, so I believe that 
we should be trying to work 
with that developer to come to 
a reasonable settlement rather 
than tying up this property and 
making it inactive for another 
two or more years.”
Grand, 
who 
voted 
for 
the repurchase, said Eaton 
was making the issue more 
complicated than it really was.
“In the past few weeks, 
there have been those who 
brought up history and they’re 
trying to make it seem more 
complicated than it is, and 
we have talked about a lot 
of complicated issues today. 
Transit, affordable housing — 
those are complicated issues,” 
she said. “This is a contract. 
This is a very simple contract 
that says, ’If you don’t do what 
you said you were going to do, 
we get to buy it back.’ And that’s 
what we’re trying to do.”
Ramlawi said the focus on 
Eaton was unfair, pointing out 
campaign contributions from 
people whose business dealings 
were 
affected 
by 
council 
decisions 
were 
relatively 
common.
“I think it’s unfair right now 
to be leveling that question 
at people who oppose the 
repurchase of the Y Lot right 
now 
because 
people 
have 
taken money from all sorts of 
people, and I think if you look 
at all these votes and look at 
who voted and who paid and 
contributed, I think it’s going to 
be really ugly and I don’t think 
it’s good for our body to be 
slinging mud,” he said. 
Taylor said donations “are a 
necessary part of a campaign,” 
but “they don’t form the basis of 
the decisions that we make or 
the positions that we take.”
“We each, I think, come to 
the council table with our own 
inherent views of how the city 
should be, our own desire to 
listen to our constituents and 
have that inform how we move 
forward,” he said.
The topic of police reform 
— the city recently approved 

a 
task 
force 
to 
provide 
recommendations 
to 
the 
council on the formation of 
a police review board — was 
also discussed by the mayoral 
candidates. Taylor said the 
process 
was 
“a 
place 
for 
members of the community 
and members of the police 
department to work together 
to understand what sort of 
policing we want in the city of 
Ann Arbor.”
“I expect them (the policing 
commission), 
importantly, 
to communicate to the chief, 
to 
communicate 
to 
(the) 
council and the public their 
assessment,” Taylor said. “Has 
the police department done 
a good job in reviewing our 
complaints?”
Eaton was more insistent on 
the process being independent 
of 
AAPD 
influence. 
The 
city’s hiring of an outside 
firm to audit the AAPD last 
summer 
frustrated 
many 
residents, 
who 
argued 
the 
review 
did 
not 
adequately 
seek input from marginalized 
community 
members. 
The 
firm’s 
controversial 
final 
recommendation 
suggested 
the police review board should 
not be able to conduct its own 
investigations.
“You cannot have police 
officers reviewing their own 
conduct. A review process has 
to be fully empowered — you 
can’t hobble the process by not 
giving full access, information, 
witnesses 
and 
videotape, 
whatever it be, to this group,” 
Eaton said. “I think that the 
basic 
distinction 
between 
camps on this particular issue 
is just how fully authorized 
and 
independent 
the 
final 
review board will be. My work 
with 
Transforming 
Justice 
Washtenaw has led me to 
believe that anything less than 
full authorization is just an 
action for appearances and not 
for actual change.”
Mayoral primaries will take 
place in August, with elections 
set for this November.

safety, increased parking and 
traffic, and an increase in 
undergraduates that would 
result in noise and littering 
problems.
“My main issue is with 
safety,” Jan Adams Watson, 
a resident near the proposed 
development 
site, 
said. 
“Ann Arbor is trying to be 
a 
walkable 
city. 
Adding 
unnecessary new traffic will 
make this more difficult. We 
already have speed problems 
and frequent accidents. I 
call the police frequently 
for traffic accidents on my 
corner.”
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Rebecca Aarons commented 
one of the major concerns 
from 
neighbors 
was 
the 
proposed 
influx 
of 
undergraduate 
students, 
bringing parties, noise and 
violations with them into the 
quiet residential area.
“My main concern is the 
negative social impact of 

this development,” Aarons 
said. “We are in the midst of 
two changing social trends. 
The increased use of not-
quite-yet legalized but more 
potent than ever marijuana 
… to the #MeToo movement, 
as a necessary upheaval in 
how mostly younger people, 
like our proposed neighbors, 
interact in consenting and 
respectful 
ways. 
These 
social evolutions are best 
played out in a much more 
supportive 
and 
local 
to 
the 
campus 
environment. 
Not the proposed isolated 
community away from U 
of M medical staff, law 
enforcement, U of M crisis 
counselors, et cetera.”
Resident Ed Gosem agreed 
the 
marketing 
toward 
undergraduate students is 
his main issue with Trinitas’s 
proposal, 
suggesting 
the 
housing be built to serve a 
wider range of residents.
“Try to attract additional 

groups of people,” Gosem 
said. “Low-income people 
needing affordable housing, 
working people, seniors. If 
these student-focused units 
fail, they’re just going to have 
to be ripped out and replaced 
with units that can serve 
a more diverse population. 
Why 
experiment? 
What’s 
wrong with doing things 
right the first time? This 
is too good a property to 
waste.”
Timothy 
Stoker, 
a 
representative for Trinitas, 
defended the development 
plan.
“We 
meet 
all 
the 
requirements,” Stoker said. 
“We’ve 
responded 
to 
all 
of the issues the planning 
committee 
has 
raised 
at 
their public hearing and we 
believe that our client has 
done its utmost to bring a 
project to the city of Ann 
Arbor 
that 
meets 
every 
aspect both in spirit and 

with the actual requirements 
of the code.”
The 
council 
voted 
to 
postpone approval of the 
project plan to September. 
Councilmember 
Sumi 
Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, was 
skeptical that the short time 
frame would be enough to 
make drastic changes to the 
plan in order to satisfy both 
developers and residents.
“I 
think 
there’s 
a 
fundamental flaw in this 
project,” Kailasapathy said. 
“And I’m not sure how that’s 
going to be fixed in two 
months, I’ll be very honest.”
Adams pushed the council 
to prioritize the desires of its 
constituents.
“It is time for City Council 
to put the needs of residents 
ahead 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
developers,” 
Watson 
said. 
“We live in the city, we pay 
taxes, we vote and you need 
to listen to us. Don’t listen to 
the developers.”


At the end of a performance, 
an 
audience’s 
applause 
is 
usually 
directed 
toward 
the 
performers 
on 
stage. 
Often times audiences aren’t 
thinking, 
however, 
of 
the 
individuals behind the scenes: 
the composers. The Student 
Composers’ Concert at the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance aims to do the opposite, 
by showing off new works from 
different student composers at 
the University.
This will be the second of five 
different composer showcases 
put on by the Composition 
Department this school year. 
Each concert features new 
works from various students in 
the Composition Department, 
each one different from the 
last. Douglas Hertz, a second-
year Master’s student in SMTD 
said “every single concert is a 
whole new experience.”
With 
an 
abundance 
of 
concerts at the music school, 
there’s usually some sort of 
central theme or consistent 
type of instrumentation. These 
recitals, however, differ from 
these as they contain pieces 
of varying themes and with 
a wide variety of different 
instrumentations.
“Everyone is exploring new 
styles all the time,” Hertz said. 
“It’s kind of hard to stylistically 
pigeonhole any of the concerts, 
or any of the composers for that 
matter.” Often, composers use 
these concerts to show off new 
works they’ve been writing.
SMTD is known throughout 
the world for its distinguished 
composition 
program. 
Graduates of the program have 
had works played by countless 
major 
symphony 
orchestras 
and have won awards from 
major organizations, including 
several Grammys. However, 
even with all of this legacy, 
the department is constantly 
exploring different ways to 

create new music.
The relationship between 
composer and performer is 
especially strong at the School 
of Music. With many strong 
departments 
of 
performers 
at their disposal, composers 
often take advantage of the 
notoriously 
talented players 
at the School of 
Music — and the 
relationship 
is 
mutual.
“People seem 
to really respect 
and 
appreciate 
composers 
and 
new music in a 
way 
that 
feels 
really 
genuine 
and 
inspiring,” 
Hertz said. “And 
I 
think 
that’s 
part of the lifeblood of being a 
composer here, is that you have 
such collaborative enterprises 
with instrumentalists, in a way 
that might not exist at other 
schools.”
Seeing this collaboration is a 

really unique experience, and 
it’s something that often leads 
to some truly magical moments. 
The school is proud to be a 
promoter of fresh music, and 
these collaborations between 
composer and performer are 
no better example of that. 
The School of 
Music, 
among 
other things, is 
known 
for 
its 
promotion 
of 
new music, and 
the Composition 
Department is at 
the forefront of 
this movement. 
Hertz said that 
performers 
are 
“hungry for new 
music,” and the 
Composition 
Department 
is 
happy to deliver.
The program consists of a 
diverse group of pieces, written 
over an expansive period of 
time.
“We 
don’t 
limit 
when 
the piece has to have been 

composed,” 
Hertz 
said. 
“However, 
they 
have 
to 
be shared with their [the 
composer’s] studio teacher… so 
sometimes people will put on 
a piece from a few years back; 
pieces that they might have 
revised and are premiering 
a new interaction — it’s very 
open.”
For composers, hearing their 
work realized can be an even 
more incredible experience. 
Hearing a digital recording 
of 
their 
piece 
performed 
by 
electronic, 
or 
MIDI, 
instruments can only do so 
much.
“MIDI only goes so far,” 
Hertz said. “It takes live 
performers to really take a 
piece to that next level.”
The 
Student 
Composers’ 
Concert is an opportunity to 
see new music be realized. It’s 
a transformative experience 
for composers and audiences 
alike. 
Hearing 
performers 
put expression into different 
composers’ work is an amazing 
experience.

Legends King Crimson 

play Michigan Theater

I don’t think King Crimson 
has ever been a band that’s 
influenced by the times, as 
in, I think it’s its own thing. I 
don’t think it’s trying to follow 
anybody else or trying to do 
something that fits in,” said 
Jeremy Stacey, one of King 
Crimson’s three drummers, in 
an interview with The Daily. 
“It’s its own beast, as it were.”
Jumping in early on the 
progressive 
rock 
movement 
of the ‘70s, King Crimson was 
formed in London in 1968. 
Currently an eight-piece lineup, 
2017’s King Crimson includes 
founding 
member 
Robert 
Fripp (guitarist, composer and 
producer), Tony Levin (bass), 
Jakko Jakszyk (vocals, guitar), 
Mel Collins (flute, saxophone), 
Gavin 
Harrison 
(drummer, 
multi-instrumentalist), 
Pat 
Mastelotto 
(drummer, 
multi-instrumentalist), 
Bill 
Rieflin 
(drummer, 
multi-
instrumentalist) and Stacey.
In ‘69, they opened for The 
Rolling Stones in London. In 
the ‘80s, they toured under a 
different name (“Discipline”) 
after a brief disbanding. Now, 
King Crimson is coming to the 
Michigan Theater in the final 
leg of their North American Fall 
Tour.
King Crimson is, and always 
has 
been, 
a 
collection 
of 
incredibly impressive musicians: 
Fripp played guitar on David 
Bowie’s “Heroes,” (a tune which 
the group covered in Berlin in 
2016). Bassist Tony Levin has 
played with the likes of Peter 
Gabriel and Paul Simon. Stacey, 
who joined the group in 2016, 
has worked with an unbelievable 
diversity of artists, including 
Noel Gallagher, Eurythmics and 
Joe Cocker.
“[King Crimson is] the most 
different thing I’ve ever done,” 

Stacey noted, most likening his 
experiences with the band to 
working with jazz in his 20s.
“I was always doing lots of 
things with lots of different 
people. I think the thing about 
jazz is that you improvise,” he 
said. “To improvise, you have 
to understand how the form 
of the piece goes, otherwise 
you get lost. It was very good 
for listening, which I think is 
the most important thing [as a 
musician].”
Unconstrained in his work, 
Stacey is the epitome of King 
Crimson’s charm: A bit nostalgic, 
a bit novel and just restless 
enough to be fearless.
“For me, my whole life has 
been musical,” Stacey explained. 
“I always feel like I’m on a 
journey. I’m very interested 
in doing extremely different 
things, and the more extremely 
different, the better… I don’t 
want to be typecast in any way.”
A fan of the simpler tracks, 
Stacey’s favorite song to play live 
is “Starless,” from the group’s 
1974 album Red.
“It’s one of my favorite pieces 
by King Crimson. I also get to 
play drums and keyboard [on it],” 
Stacey said. “There’s a freedom 
to playing whatever I feel on the 
night. I think (it’s) my favorite 
moment of the gig, normally.”
This 
autonomy 
Stacey 
mentions is laced throughout 
King Crimson’s work: Each 
piece is malleable to the group’s 
interpretation.
“I feel that I’m involved in 
it more than I’ve been in other 
projects,” Stacey said. “It’s not 
like doing a job. There is input, 
and it’s a very in the moment 
form of input on stage … I can’t 
compare it to anything.”
The 
experience 
often 
transcends description.

Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers at the Pig

Like it or hate it, the holiday 
season is undeniably upon us. A 
walk down Main Street offers 
proof of this: bright lights wrap 
themselves 
gracefully 
around 
trees, Christmas carols ring from 
inviting Kerrytown shops and 
couples walk hand-in-hand with 
a seemingly newfound sense of 
happiness.
If you’re like me and love the 
spontaneous 
comradery 
that 
springs up during this time of year, 
or just need a way to escape the 
mounting stress of finals, you’re 
in luck. The classic holiday special 
“The Nutcracker” will make a 
reappearance this Saturday at the 
Michigan Theater.
This performance of “The 
Nutcracker” is presented by the 
Academy of Russian Classical 
Ballet, 
based 
in 
Wixom, 
Michigan. The Academy is made 
up of talented ballet students from 
Michigan and Ohio who learn the 
traditional Vaganova (Russian) 
style of classical ballet. The 
Academy also holds a Professional 
Trainee Program for students 
intending to pursue ballet as a 
profession.
This is the third time the 
Academy 
will 
perform 
“The 
Nutcracker” 
at 
Michigan 
Theater, and they intend to keep 
the performance as close to the 
Russian Bolshoi Ballet Company’s 
rendition as possible.
As a way to follow the original 
ballet, this particular rendition 
doesn’t “have a specific wooden 
Nutcracker doll. We have a 
younger dancer who performs 
the role,” said co-director of the 
Academy Jessica Morschakov in 
an interview with the Daily.
The dancers are excited that 
their version of “The Nutcracker” 
stands out from other modern 
interpretations. “For the Spanish 
(corps), it’s really interesting to do 
the original choreography rather 
than something newer,” said Nina 

Schotland, a dancer in the Spanish 
dance sequence. Schotland, an 
LSA freshman, performs in the 
Waltz of the Flowers and in the 
Spanish corps as a soloist, in 
addition to other roles.
Professional 
ballet 
dancers 
from Moscow Ballet in Russia 
will join the cast of local ballet 
students on Saturday. “Our young 
Clara and young Nutcracker are 
Michigan students,” Morschakov 
said. After Clara, the main child 
protagonist of the play, enters 
her dreamland, the Nutcracker 
is transformed into a handsome 
prince. The Russian professionals 
will perform “the grown-up 
version of Clara and the Prince.”
Tchaikovsky’s score for “The 
Nutcracker” is timeless, even for 
the dancers who’ve performed it 
many times before. “I listen to it 
a lot. I wake up to it,” said Luke 
Eller. Eller will play the role of 
the Fritz, Clara’s mean brother 
and the Nutcracker in the first act, 
among others.
The 
Oakland 
Homeschool 
Choir, a local children’s choir that 
gives homeschooled children a 
chance to participate in musical 
education, will provide live music 
as per the original. “The music 
of Tchaikovsky ... was written 
with the Children’s Choir of St. 
Petersburg singing during the 
Snow scene,” Morschakov said. 
They aim to parallel this effect 
with the Oakland Homeschool 
Choir.
“To let people enjoy the beauty 
and artistry of classical ballet 
is a really unique experience,” 
Schotland said. The performance 
boasts 
beautiful 
backdrops, 
intricate hand-sewn costumes 
and 
a 
mystical 
ambiance 
combined 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Michigan Theater.
The passion of the Academy is 
sure to whisk the audience away 
to a wonderful winter dreamland. 
Saturday’s performance of “The 
Nutcracker” promises to add 
a magical touch to the holiday 
season.

Chick Corea to bring an electrifying performance

Few artists have electrified 
Ann Arbor audiences like Chick 
Corea. His 2015 performance 
with Herbie Hancock was one 
of the most recent University 
Musical Society performances 
of the past couple of years. His 
historic performance at Hill 
Auditorium during the Great 
Blizzard of 1978 (again with 
Herbie Hancock) was released 
as part one of “An Evening 
with Herbie Hancock & Chick 
Corea: In Concert.”
This 
coming 
weekend, 
Corea partners with the Jazz 
at Lincoln Center Orchestra to 
present an evening of Corea’s 
music 
at 
Hill 
Auditorium. 
The concert will also feature 
the Jazz at Lincoln Center 
Orchestra, another ensemble 
that has proven to be extremely 
popular among Ann Arbor 
audiences.
This concert also marks 
the end of the Jazz at Lincoln 
Center’s first tour without 
Wynton 
Marsalis, 
the 
accomplished leader of the 
ensemble who is currently 

taking a brief hiatus to pursue 
other projects.
“This was a good first foray 
into touring without Wynton,” 
said Jason Olaine, Director 
of Programming and Touring 
for Jazz at Lincoln Center, in 
an interview with The Daily. 
As they enter their last couple 
days of performances, “the 
band and Chick have been 
really happy.”
Jazz at Lincoln Center is a 
notoriously busy organization. 
I interviewed Olaine as he 
arrived back to New York 
from 
Shanghai, 
and 
as 
the 
ensemble 
moved 
from 
Arizona 
to 
Chicago. 
With 
this hectic schedule, it’s easy 
to understand why Marsalis 
might have stepped away from 
the ensemble for a little while.
“Usually our Jazz at Lincoln 
Center Orchestra with Wynton 
Marsalis tours between 13 and 
18 weeks every year,” Olaine 
said. “Wynton scheduled a 
short sabbatical and our agent 
happens to be Chick’s agent.”
While the Jazz at Lincoln 
Center Orchestra and Chick 
Corea go on tour all the time, 
Ann Arbor is lucky to have 

hosted 18 previous Jazz at 
Lincoln 
Center 
Orchestra 
concerts and five previous 
Chick Corea concerts.
“This concert does speak to 
your in-house-programming to 
have been able to secure this 
date,” Olaine said.
Corea is perhaps best known 
today for his versatility. He 
has performed throughout his 
career with a huge number 
of artists, collaborating with 
everyone from Miles Davis 
to Bobby McFerrin. He has 
worked frequently in the past 
with the Jazz at Lincoln Center 
Orchestra and is quite popular 
among the members of the 
ensemble.
Last time he worked with 
the orchestra, “Chick had a 
great time and we loved it,” 
Olaine said. “Victor Goines 
has been working with Chick 
as 
co-music 
director,” 
he 
continued, 
and 
there 
has 
been “lots of great energy all 
around.”
Corea and the ensemble 
have gone on to develop a close 
relationship, performing not as 
soloist and orchestra but as a 
coherent ensemble.

“It’s a little bit different than 
coming up with a new setlist 
every 
night,” 
Olaine 
said. 
“Chick is such a grandmaster, 
and it’s been to be pretty 
special (to work with him).”
In the past, the ensemble 
has collaborated with Corea to 
perform newer compositions. 
They 
also 
worked 
quite 
extensively on the music of 
Thelonious 
Monk. 
During 
this tour, however, they’re 
“primarily 
focusing 
on 
(Corea’s) 
music,” 
Olaine 
explained.
Saturday’s 
performance 
marks the end of the tour that 
started in Provo, Utah on Mar. 
20. Given what he has heard 
of the first portion of the tour, 
Olaine seemed confident that 
it will be a magical event. The 
Final Four basketball game on 
the same night recently pushed 
the concert back a half hour, 
and he predicted that this 
would only add to the energy of 
the performance.
“The concert in Michigan 
on Saturday is gonna be a 
great one,” Olaine said. In 
their previous collaborations, 
“Chick has had a great time 
and we absolutely loved it.”
As for future performances 
of both the Jazz at Lincoln 
Center Orchestra and Chick 
Corea in Ann Arbor, Olaine was 
hesitant to make any promises. 
“When it works out next, we’ll 
see,” he said.
As for the end of the tour, 
however, he predicted a great 
performance. 
Saturday’s 
performance will mark the 
end of a fantastic tour and 
(hopefully) the beginning of 
a new collaboration between 
artist and ensemble.
“Chick has been having a 
great time, and our guys love 
Chick,” Olaine said. All in 
all, it promises to be another 
exciting evening for these two 
ensembles in a city that has 
played host to some remarkable 
concerts from them over the 
past 40 years.

“You 
can 
have 
these 
really crazy, intense shows 
there. That kind of grungy 
environment just propagates 
intimacy; 
it’s 
a 
special 
kind of intimacy. Some of 
my favorite shows of all 
time have been at the Blind 
Pig,” said Joe Hertler in an 
interview with The Daily.
Fresh, funky and a little 
far-out, the pop band Joe 
Hertler 
& 
The 
Rainbow 
Seekers is set for a two-
night 
return 
to 
the 
Pig 
this weekend. I’m dancing 
already.
“We probably met, I want 

to say, five, six years ago. 
We were all in college. Half 
the band went to Central 
Michigan and half went to 
Michigan 
State,” 
Hertler 
said. “We were kind of just 
jamming 
in 
college 
and 
playing co-ops and stuff like 
that, and it slowly developed 
into something that was a 
little more involving.”
The 
group 
consists 
of 
Hertler (vocals, guitar and 
lyrics), 
Micah 
Bracken 
(keyboard), 
Jason 
Combs 
(bass), 
Aaron 
Stinson 
(saxophone), 
Rick 
Hale 
(drums), 
Ryan 
Hoger 
(guitar) and Kevin Pritchard 
(producer, bass).
Despite echoes of Edward 
Sharpe’s soul and Vulfpeck’s 

funk, Hertler’s songs often 
blossom from alt-rock. He’ll 
write a demo, then give it to 
the band, at which point the 
groovier elements start to 
bubble up as they work their 
Rainbow Seeker magic on it.
“Growing 
up 
in 
the 
’90s, that was the music 
I connected to. It was the 
music that I first engaged 
with, which is kind of how 
it is for everyone from age 16 
to their mid-20s. You know, 
those formative years where 
the music you listen to is 
what you tend to identify 
with,” Hertler said. “I guess 
that’s where the love affairs 
really started.”
Never having skyrocketed 
in popularity, the Rainbow 
Seekers have been gradually 
expanding their fervent fan 
base over the years. Each 
show is bigger than the last, 
and the group is driven by 
pure passion.
“It’s 
just 
really 
fun,” 
Hertler said. “All of us do 
other things, but so much 
of it is just part of your 
identity.”
On the band’s off-months, 
he works for the American 
Cancer Society and teaches 
English. 
To 
keep 
their 
experiences 
colorful, 
the 
Rainbow 
Seekers 
try 
to 
revamp a couple tracks each 
year.
“I’ve 
never 
been 
more 
excited to play ‘Jetski,’ of 
all 
songs,” 
Hertler 
said. 
“I’m always thankful that 
people like certain songs and 
respond well to them, but to 
redo them — while the core 
of the song is still the same 
— to have some things that 
have been changed is a fun 
challenge,” Hertler said.
Michigan-bred 
and 
Michigan-based, 
JH+TRS 
love, 
love, 
love 
their 
Michiganders. They’ve built 
a 
rainbow-seeking 
family 
through the band, and they 
carry pieces of home with 
them wherever they go.
“We’ve had opportunities 
to leave the state, and we’ve 
thought about it, as every 

band does … but this is our 
home. A couple years ago, 
we decided to stick it out 
here. If it doesn’t work out, 
that’s alright,” Hertler said. 
“One of the nice things 
about Michigan is that a lot 
of people leave and go to 
other places. When we go to 
Denver or LA or NY — just 
a lot of big cities — there’s 
always a couple hundred 
Michiganders.”
JH+TRS radiate a certain 
warmth that lets them exist 
in a lane of their own within 
the 
funk-pop 
landscape. 
They don’t take themselves 
too seriously, and every inch 
of their success is welcomed 
with nothing but gratitude. I 
met Hertler at the Espresso 
Royale on State, and it felt 
more like catching up with 
a friend than an interview. 
They’re 
a 
groovy 
bunch, 
and everything from their 
earnest lyrics to their smooth 
rhythms to their name itself 
is just one massive bear-hug.
The 
Rainbow 
Seekers’s 
most recent album, Pluto, 
is stunning in its existence 
as both heartbreaking and 
dance-inducing. I’m not a 
fan of using the word “real” 
to describe music, much less 
people, but this album — this 
band — is real in every sense 
of the word. They’re genuine 
in their joy and human in 
their heartache, and they’re 
all about connecting with 
people 
through 
unsullied 
authenticity.
“I 
think 
the 
focus 
of 
the music has always been 
the 
live 
show,” 
Hertler 
said. “Music is this form 
of 
communication, 
and 
when that communication 
is locked in, there’s a buzz 
you get. It’s in those tender 
moments where the magic 
is. I hate to be like, ‘It’s 
magical! It’s spiritual!’ But it 
is, in a way.”
Welcoming Ann Arbor like 
a second home, Joe Hertler 
& The Rainbow Seekers will 
play the Blind Pig this Friday 
and Saturday.

‘The Nutcracker’ brings 
its magic to Michigan


Fall 2018 — 7E
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Music and magic at the first night of the 41st Annual Ann Arbor Folk Festival

On Friday, Jan. 26, Ann Arbor 
locals and residents from the 
far corners of the mitten state 
alike flocked to the University’s 
own Hill Auditorium for the 41st 
Annual Ann Arbor Folk Festival. 
Being so close to the festival, in 
geographical terms, might make 
University of Michigan students 
write the event off as a minor 
happening, but the festival is, in 
reality, central to the Ann Arbor 
music scene. At its core, Folkfest, 
as it’s often amicably referred 
to, serves two express purposes. 
First, it is a fundraiser for (and 
by) The Ark, a local venue and 
hub for all things folk. Second, 
it draws people from all over the 
Midwest together to partake in 
an oft-underappreciated genre. 
A folk festival whose headliners 
include Jason Isbell and John 
Prine can only be expected to 
meet expectations, but Friday’s 
portion of the annual event far 
surpassed them. While the final 
act of the night was always sure 
to be a success, there was never 
a dull moment during the night’s 
earlier 
performances. 
Every 
set was musically compelling 
and honest, and a few artists 

managed to touch on the current 
state of affairs in a way that felt 
refreshing and candid.
At half past six, as the audience 
continued to fill the auditorium, 
Chastity Brown took to the stage. 
If the occasional usher’s light 
or the murmur of conversation 
were 
distracting, 
she 
didn’t 
show it, and soon after she began 
playing the room fell quiet. 
With 
sparse 
instrumentation 
— acoustic and electric guitar 
as well as a single bass pedal — 
she set the tone for the night: 
intimate, 
soulful, 
reflective. 
Before playing her last song, 
she offered her thoughts on the 
past year, recounting in specific 
an incident immediately before 
one of her shows when a white 
supremacist 
approached 
her, 
shouting insults and threatening 
violence. Though the story itself 
was disheartening, Brown’s tone 
during the following song was 
overwhelmingly hopeful. With 
the mood defined and a powerful 
set delivered, she exited the stage.
One thing that we absolutely 
can’t help but credit The Ark for 
is their efficiency. Every year, 
Folkfest 
is 
a 
demonstration 
not only of folk music and the 
culture that surrounds it, but 
also of entertainment at peak 

efficiency. Only moments after 
Brown exited and before her 
applause had subsided, emcee 
Joe Pug appeared stage right, 
guitar and harmonica at the 
ready. A talented musician in 
his own right, and even more 
impressive 
entertainer, 
Pug 
kept the audience’s attention 
between sets. While he played 
original songs and offered his 
tastefully subtle sense of humor, 
stage hands and audio engineers 
prepared the stage for the next 
set with a degree of coordination 
that could qualify as art in and of 
itself.
After Brown came the duo 
Dead Horses, comprised of Sarah 
Vos on acoustic guitar and Daniel 
Wolff on double bass. Though an 
ostensibly odd pairing, the two 
managed to fill the room with 
their hymnal-like sound, Wolff’s 
fingers dexterous on the neck of 
his bass. Next was Lori McKenna, 
writer of “Humble and Kind,” 
which took the Grammy for 
Best Country Song in 2017. Her 
apparent comfort on stage was 
infectious, no doubt a product of 
her experience as a performer, 
and the songs she performed 
were influenced in part by her 
five children.
Also a proud parent — though 

to four rather than five — 
Massachusetts-based 
Stephen 
Kellogg played the final set 
before intermission, a rousing 
romp that consisted of just four 
or five songs, ones 
that made me wish he 
would play one or two 
or five more. What 
was beautiful about 
Kellogg’s performance 
was 
his 
sheer 
exuberance at being 
on stage. He beamed 
out at the audience 
with an eagerness and 
thankfulness that was 
reflected 
perfectly 
in the energy with 
which he delivered his 
uplifting folk-anthems. 
It was hard not to be 
excited both with him 
and for him.
Following intermission were 
JJ Grey & Mofro, a prolific group 
whose performance received an 
immediate standing ovation at 
its conclusion. The act featured 
not one but two trumpets, both 
of whom played huge solos, and 
John 
Higginbotham 
(aka 
JJ 
Grey) himself on harmonica. 
Afterward, Jason Isbell and the 
400 Unit took to the stage. Now, 

although 41st anniversaries don’t 
tend to be particularly notable 
in and of themselves, the Folk 
Festival’s 41st marked at least 
one significant change. During 
the final set 
of the night, 
several 
stadium-
style 
lights 
came 
on, 
filling 
the 
hall 
with 
motion 
and 
colorful 
patterns. 
This was the 
first 
year 
for 
these 
features, and 
more 
than 
providing 
pretty 
visuals, they 
signify growth for the festival, 
and hopefully not a departure 
from what has made it so near 
and dear to Ann Arbor’s heart for 
the past two generations.
Isbell 
and 
company’s 
set 
made the lights feel appropriate, 
and 
guitar 
solos 
abounded. 
The most valuable parts of the 
performance, 
though, 
came 
between 
songs, 
when 
Isbell 

exhibited his charisma, making 
well-received jabs at the kind of 
people who leave the room when 
he plays “White Man’s World” 
and giving a nod, before his 
last song, to his struggles with 
alcoholism. It was the sort of 
honesty that wouldn’t necessarily 
be expected from a festival 
headliner, even if the festival 
were a folk festival in Ann Arbor, 
and that’s not even mentioning 
the 
counterintuitiveness 
of 
Isbell’s decision to write and 
perform a song that he knows 
challenges a significant portion 
of his listeners. At the end of the 
night, attendees had a choice: 
They could leave Hill with a 
splendid night of music behind 
them, memories of soaring vocals 
and subtle harmonies, harmonica 
solos played at a breakneck 
pace and softly sung acoustic-
guitar ballads, or choose to see 
a community being fostered. 
Four bars of music can sound 
as pleasant as you want, but it’s 
seeing and knowing the human 
side of it that makes those 
melodies truly awe-inspiring and 
that brings the folk community 
together. It makes me excited 
for Folkfest 2019 — even just two 
days after 2018’s iteration.
