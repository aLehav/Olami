Continuous

As policy inches to
implementation,
student grievances,
confusion continue
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
Though the continuous enroll-
ment policy in Rackham Graduate
School was announced last year,
many students involved in nego-
tiations surrounding the policy
say they are still unclear on what
the policy actually means.
The policy, which was first
announced last semester, would
require students in a Rackham
doctorate programs to register
every fall and winter term until
they complete their degrees - a
change that would consequently
decrease tuition rates for gradu-
ate students.
Fromits infancythepolicysuf-
fered from what many consider to
be a poor publicrelations strategy,
leaving faculty and students alike
confused over the policy's details
and its ramifications for the edu-
cational experience in Rackham.
That lack of clarity sparked some
backlash from students and even
prompted the formation of the
"Continuous Enrollment Work
Group," an organization of Uni-
versity graduate students who say

the proposal was not being accu-
rately portrayed to the Rackham
community.
One major effect of the new
policy would be that students
will be required to pay tuition
each semester - something they
currently don't have to do if they
decide to take time off to care for
children or do special study in the
field, though the new policy will
accommodate some situations
that would allow students not to
enroll for a semester.
In the midst of all of this, the
Rackham Student Government
passed two resolutions over the-
summer requesting more infor-
mation about the policy from
Rackham administrators.
"Within 48 hours, somewhere
around 472 students signed a
letter of support for the resolu-
tions just because they were very
concerned that they hadn't had
access to this information and
were excited about the opportu-
nity," Rackham student Marie
Puccio said.
She added that Associate Dean
Peggy McCracken accepted the
resolutions.
The first resolution requested
Rackham to follow up in writing
to the Continuous Enrollment
Student Advisory Committee -
a group established last spring
by the University in order to
facilitate communication with

Authorities announce charges in
California marijuana ring case

18 suspects arrestedin
SanFrancisco,but
half remainatlarge
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
- Federal authorities in Califor-
nia announced charges yesterday
against 18 people they said oper-
ated a lucrative marijuana-growing
operation by converting Central
Valley homes into high-tech pot
nurseries.
They estimated the value of the
marijuana crop at nearly $100 mil-
lion a year.
All the suspects are from the San
Francisco Bay area, but half remain
at large, including several who
authorities believe fled to China or
HongKong.
Nine were arrested early yester-
day on drug and real estate fraud
charges. All but one of them made
initial court appearances later in
the day. The remaining suspect
already is in federal prison in Cali-
fornia on unrelated charges,

Thursday's actions brought to 34
thenumber ofpeople whohave been
charged in an investigation dating
to 2006 and 2007. Law enforcement
agents previously discovered about
24,500 marijuana plants grow-
ing inside 51 converted homes in
Sacramento, Elk Grove, Lathrop,
Modesto, Stockton and Tracy.
The operation would have pro-
duced nearly 11 tons of high-grade
marijuana each year with an esti-
mated street value of $96 million,
said Gordon Taylor, who heads the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration's Central Valley office.
He said the ring was one of the
largest and most sophisticated
indoor marijuana growing opera-
tions in the nation.
Prosecutors said the grow-
ers bought homes for between
$400,000 and $600,000, most in
subdivisions that were new or a few
years old. They knocked out interior
walls, installed expensive ventila-
tion and hydration equipment, and
tapped power lines to grow thou-
sands of plants.

Agents said the growing systems
alone cost tens of thousands of dol-
lars for each home.
Taylor called it "one of the larg-6
est, most sophisticated residential
indoor marijuana growing opera-
tions in U.S. history."
"They came into our cookie-cut-
ter residential neighborhoods and
created cookie-cutter marijuana
factories," Taylor said at a news
conference. "It affected the real
estate, mortgage and utility com-
pany industries, not to mention the
stigma it placed on the neighbor-
hoods where hardworking people
worked for years to save up enough
money to buy one of these nice
homes."
He said the operation was con-
nected to organized crime but
would not elaborate.
Officer Chris Trim of the Elk
Grove Police Department south
of Sacramento said it took federal
agents and Internal Revenue Ser-
vice investigators several years to
work their way up the chain and
through real estate documents.

Family of victims
continue to mourn
in wake of trial
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - A man
charged in one of the worst mass
slayings in Indianapolis history
was convicted yesterday of. kill-
ing seven members of one fam-
ily,.including three children, in a
bloody rampage prosecutors said
stemmed from a quest for drugs
and cash that didn't exist.
Marion Superior Court Judge
Robert Altice convicted Desmond
Turner, 31, on 23 counts stemming
from the June 1, 2006, deaths of
Emma Valdez, 46; her husband,
Alberto Covarrubias, 56; the cou-
ple's young sons, Alberto, 11, and
David, 8; and Valdez's adult son
and daughter, Magno Albarran
and Flora Albarran and Flora's
son Lois, S.
Turner, who waived his right to
a jury trial in exchange for pros-
ecutors dropping their request for
the death penalty, faces up to life
without parole. The sentencing
phase of the trial starts today.
Marion County Prosecutor
Carl Brizzi said he did not have
the evidence needed to meet the
high standard of proof required
for a capital conviction. Prosecu-
tors' case was built on witness
accounts and other circumstan-
tial evidence. They lacked a
murder weapon or any physical
evidence tying Turner directly to
the scene.
Maria Flores of Indianapolis,
Emma Valdez's sister, said after
the verdict that the death penalty
wouldn't have made a difference.
"Killing him won't bring our
family back," she said.
Defense attorney Brent West-
erfeld had hoped to capitalize on
the prosecution's lack of physi-
cal evidence. During his closing
arguments, he put up diagrams of

a shirt and pants that police found
soaking in the bathtub of a friend
of Turner's the day after the slay-
ings. The clothing contained DNA
evidence from Turner but not the
victims, he noted.
Altice, however, said Turner's
actions after the slayings, includ-
ing washing his clothes and flee-
ing to Kentucky, weighed heavily
in his ruling.
"Mr. Turner was indeed the
main shooter," he said.
Brizzi said the case was solved
"old-school," without DNA evi-
dence, and that there was no
physical evidence linking Turner
to the crime scene because he and
co-defendant James Stewart had
been careful. Stewart has pleaded
not guilty to murder charges and
his trial is set for Nov. 30.
Westerfeld also tried to dis-
credit the prosecution's main wit-
ness, Brandon Griffith, who had
testified that he had seen Turner
force his way into Valdez's home
with an assault rifle minutes
before the slayings.
"I don't believe we begin to
understand Brandon Griffith's abil-
ity to lie," Westerfeld told Altice.
During closing arguments, the
prosecution put about eight items
on an evidence table. Westerfeld
started his summation by putting
two large boxes containing evi-
dence introduced during the trial,
including the clothes Turner wore
the night of the slayings.
He pushed both boxes down the
table, crowding out the few items
the prosecution had used.
"They didn't bring the moun-
tain of evidence ... because the
mountain of evidence moves to
the defense side," he said.
Prosecutors Jennifer Haley and
Janna Skelton vividly described
how many bullets struck each
victim, noting that in some cases
the shots blew off parts of the vic-
tims' skulls. Several relatives of
the family were in tears.

despite rising unemployment.
The number of new claims for
jobless benefits jumped more than
expected last week. Claims had
fallen in five out of the previous
six weeks, and most economists
expect that trend to continue but
at a slow pace, with employers still
reluctant to hire.
The Conference Board said
yesterday that its index of leading
economic indicators rose 1 percent
last month after a 0.4 percent gain
in August, beating economists'
expectations.
The group said the indicators'
5.7 percent growth rate in the
six months through September
was the strongest since 1983, but
joblessness is weighing on the
rebound. Dips in manufacturing
hours worked and building per-
mits, a gauge of future construc-

tion, were the only two measures
out of 10 that weighed down the
index. It is meant to project eco-
nomic activity in the next three to
six months.
The six-month rate is consistent
with annual economic growth of
about 8 percent, said Paul Dales,
U.S. economist at Capital Eco-
nomics. It's unlikely the rebound
will be that strong, however, as
the index may be "distorted" by
the Federal Reserve's rock-bottom
interest rates and market liquidity
measures, he said.
The government will report on
third-quarter economic growth
next week. Many economists think
gross domestic product - the value
of all goods and services produced
in the United States- grew about
3 percent after falling for a record
four straight quarters. But many
wonder if that pace can continue in
the current quarter and next year
as unemployment rises and con-
sumers remain hesitant to spend.
Lack of job growth is a major
problem. The Labor Department
said the number of newly laid-
off workers filing claims for job-
less benefits rose to a seasonally
adjusted 531,000 lastweek, from an
upwardly revised 520,000 the pre-

vious week. Wall Street economists
had expected only aslight increase,
according to Thomson Reuters.
Economists consider jobless
claims a gauge of layoffs and a sign
of companies' willingness to hire.
The four-week average of claims,
which smooths out fluctuations, fell
to its lowest level since mid-Janu-
ary. But claims remain well above
the 325,000 that economists say is
consistent with a healthy economy.
The report is "slightly disap-
pointing," Ian Shepherdson, chief
U.S. economist at High Frequency
Economics, wrote in a note to cli-
ents."Butitdoesnotchangethecore
story, which is that ... a clear down-
ward trend in claims has emerged"
over the past two months.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
economist Ethan Harris expects
the economy to grow at a 3.3 per-
cent pace in 2010, even though
the Federal Reserve forecasts the
unemployment rate will stay above
9 percent.
There's a "shift away from
being so reliant on U.S. consumer
demand," he said. Spending on
homes and apartments, along with
businessesrestockingtheirinvento-
ries could propel the economy even
as shoppers stay home, he added.

Taliban dig in as Pakistani
army mounts new offensive

Military advance met.
with series of suicide
bombings and raids
across Afghanistan
DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Paki-
stan (AP) - Residents fleeing a
6-day-old Pakistani army offen-
sive in a Taliban stronghold along
the Afghan border reported
Thursday that the insurgents are
digging in for a fight and travel
the roads freely.
Tired and dusty refugees arriv-
ing in this northwestern town
Thursday from different parts
of South Waziristan reported
intense army bombing by jets and
helicopters but said they had seen
no ground troops.
The accounts by a dozen refu-
gees to Associated Press report-
ers are a sign of just how much
fighting remains before the mili-
tary can even hope to clear the
area, which in recent years has
become a major global hub for al-
Qaida and other extremist groups
who carry out attacks against U.S.
troops in Adghanistan.
The militants were believed to
control roughly 1,275 square miles
of territory before the offensive
began. That portion covers about
half of South Waziristan, which
itself is slightly larger than Dela-
ware.
The military say its troops are
progressing steadily and retaking
land on-three fronts. But officers
have made it clear that the cam-
paign will be long and bloody
and acknowledged resistance is
tough.
As the army presses into their
heartland, the militants are try-
ing to bring the war to the rest of
Pakistan.
Over the last 20 days, they
have killed more than 170 people

in a series of suicide bombings
and raids on Western, civilian
and security-force targets across
the country.
In the latest attack, suspected
insurgents on a motorbike shot
and killed a senior army officer
and a soldier Thursday in a resi-
dential part of the capital, Islam-
abad. The slain officer, Ahmed
Moinuddin, was on leave from
his job as deputy commander of
the U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Sudan.
The attack came despite
ramped-up security nationwide.
It was believed to be the first tar-
geted killing of an army officer
in the capital, a sign of evolving
militant strategies.
The United Nations says
110,000 people have fled South
Waziristan in recent months as
speculation rose of an army offen-
sive, about 30,000 of them in the
last few days. Most are staying
with relatives or in rented homes
in Dera Ismail Khan and nearby
districts.
New arrivals said the Taliban
were preparing for a fight.
"We saw no ground forces on
the way, nothing except helicop-
ters and airplanes. But we saw a
lot of Taliban movement," said
Awal Jan, a refugee from the town
of Sarwakai. "They were roaming
around in their vehicles and dig-
ging trenches in the mountains."
Pakistan is under intense
pressure to eliminate Islamist
militant groups sheltering in its
northwest that also attack U.S.
and NATO troops in Afghanistan.
The military has battled them in
various districts, losing hundreds
of soldiers, but questions remain
about its overall strategic com-
tnitment to the fight.
The army has previously
moved into South Waziristan
three times since 2004. Each time
it has suffered high casualties

and signed peace deals that left
insurgents with effective con-
trol of the region. Western offi-
cials say al-Qaida now uses it and
neighboring North Waziristan as
an operations and training base.
One refugee said Taliban fighters
had told villagers they must join
them or flee.
"They said, 'If you want to
side with us, you may. If you are
scared of death, then leave imme-
diately,"' said Habibullah, who
gave only a single name.
Maadi Shah, his wife and five
children walked for a day to
escape.
"Earlier there was aerial bomb-
ing once a day, but now it is hap-
pening countless times," he said.
"We saw the Taliban shifting to
the mountains toward Makeen
(the main town). They are well-
entrenched there," said Shah,
who stopped talking after a man
warned him of possible Taliban
retaliation for meeting reporters.
The current offensive pits
28,000 troops against some
12,000 militants, 1,000 of them
believed to be foreign fighters,
mostly Chechens and Arabs. They
are fighting in an unforgiving
landscape of hulking mountains,
rock-strewn valleys and sparse
vegetation.
A military statement Thursday
reported two more soldiers were
killed, bringing the army's death
toll to 18, and that 24 more mili-
tants were slain, bringing their
death toll to 129. Reporters are
blocked from entering the region,
meaning verifying information is
all but impossible.
Authorities say they are not
expecting a major humanitarian
crisis like the one triggered by
an offensive in the northwestern
Swat Valley earlier this year. Still,
many refugees have complained
of receiving little or no govern-
ment assistance.

Carpe diem
Obama must protect Great Lakes from invasive species
A nyone who has seen a license plate from the Great Lakes
State knows that the lakes are an integral part of Michi-
gan's identity. But the Great Lakes' ecosystem is often in
danger due to sewage and invasive species. Currently, the latter
problem is most concerning - the lakes face a potential attack
from the Asian carp, a violent, invasive species of fish. The carp
are only one scaly bound away from harming the Great Lakes and
Michigan industries. To protect Michigan's lakes and economy,
President Barack Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers must

What racism means today

a

act quickly to stop the carp.
Thirty years ago, Asian carp were
imported by southern fish farms to con-
trol algae. But several species escaped
into southern waterways and migrated
north. According to the Alliance for the
Great Lakes, the carp, which are vora-
cious eaters, now represent 98 percent of
the biomass in parts of the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers. Rainfall could cause the
Des Plaines River to flood into a neighbor-
ing canal connected to Lake Michigan,
giving the carp a path around the Army
Corps of Engineers's electric fences that
were created to stop the migration of the
carp. A bill headed to Obama's desk would
allocate funds to allow the Army Corps of
Engineers to study existing barriers and
build new ones between the waterways to
stop the carp's progress.
Invasive species have far-reaching
ecological consequences. The lakes have
already seen the negative effects of the
presence of other invasive species like
zebra mussels, which upset the balance
of the ecosystem by interrupting the food
chain and interfering in breeding practic-
es. Asian carp, which consume dispropor-
tionate amounts of food, would displace
native species on a massive scale. The
ripples from such a change would impact
aquatic plants, fish and water-dependent
birds and mammals, dramatically dis-

rupting the ecosystem around the Great
Lakes.
Damage to the ecosystem would also
have effects on the economy. Michigan's
second-largest industry is tourism, and it's
based upon the appeal of the Great Lakes.
Recreational fishing and boating entices
tourists to the state every year. The carp,
which can grow to four feet in length and
weigh more than 85 pounds, pose a safety
risk to water-bound tourists. Though it
may sound like an urban myth, the fish
have a history of leaping out of the water
and harming boaters and skiers.
Michigan's commercial fishing indus-
try is also at risk. The fishing industry is
already struggling to survive under the
economic recession, and the decrease in
native fish will damage the industry even
further. As the ecosystem of the lakes fal-
ters and fish die, these industries won't be
able to function.
But disaster can be averted with the
help of the federal government. The bill
currently on its way to Obama's desk will
expand the effort to stop the carp's prog-
ress. This bill is vital to the safety of the
lakes, which is in turn vital to not only
the Michigan economy, but the entire
Great Lakes region. This is something that
Obama, a native of Illinois, should be well
aware of.

So far, the most prominent racial
debates of 2009 have thrown
around the term racism as if
400 years of our
nation's cruel
racial history has'
not defined the
concept. Today, '
everyone is con-
sidered racist. But
there is a sharp dif-
ference between
Obama's supposed MATTHEW
"racism" and Rush
Limbaugh's liken- HUNTER
ing of NFL games
to a battle between
the Bloods and the Crips, only with-
out weapons.
Although the term is abused,
identifying racism is important to
identifying racial injustice. But an
accusation of racism has two effects,
both of which impede progressive
racial dialogue. First, it angers folks
who are the victim of an accusation,
because racism is equated with moral
bankruptcy. And second, those who
are suspicious of racism and those
who are accused of it misuse the
word to apply to any potentially racial
issue, which effectively reduces the
word's meaning.
The meaning of racism is hotly
debated. Does racism still exist? Can
minorities be racist? Does racism
refer to an oppressive system rather
than individuals? Is all racial dis-
crimination racism? Whatever your
answers, there are some key points
that can help us distinguish between
the who's who of racist dialogue.
Over time, the bar to escape rac-
ism has risen. If, for example, Keith
Bardwell doesn't marry interracial

couples even though he says he has
black friends, as reported by the New
York Times on Oct. 17, he is still a rac-
ist. Because civil rights progress has
been made, that which is blatantly
racist is no longer the main concern.
Instead, we need to reassess racism
that has been clouded, to some, by
larger issues of the past. .
According to an Oct. 14 New York
Times article, Limbaugh was dropped
from his bid to be co-owner of the
St. Louis Rams after NFL Commis-
sioner Roger Goodell denounced his
bid because it sparked racial contro-
versy. Afew black Rams players said
they would not play for ateam associ-
ated with the controversial talk show
host.
In addition to criminalizing black
NFL players, Limbaugh is clear on
what he thinks of blacks.
Fair.org noted in a June 7, 2000
article titled "A Color Man Who has
a Problem with Color," that Lim-
baugh has made such statements as,
"Have you ever noticed how all com-
posite pictures of wanted criminals
resemble Jesse Jackson?" and, "The
NAACP should have riot rehearsal.
They should get a liquor store and
practice robberies."
Limbaugh is a part of a growing
trend of people whodeny their own
racism. They are offended by claims
of oppression or excuses to justify
incompetence, laziness and crimi-
nality. But Limbaugh and his ilk
would think differently if they could
experience what it feels like to be a
part of an oppressed minority. They
would know how it feels to have
police slam you against a wall and
call you a nigger, like they did to me,
or be shot in the back for no reason,

which is what happened to Oscar
Grant, a black California man, on
January 1, 2009. They would know
how it feels to go to school where
only six percent, or less, of the stu-
dents were their race. If Limbaugh
knew what it was like to sit in the
back of the bus, he would reconsider
his continued racial slander.
Higher standards
for defining
discrimination.

U

Everyone has the potential to
be racist. But there is a difference
between white racism and minority
racism. The reason the black com-
munity - and the Latino community
- is in a disproportionate social state
is because of racial oppression. White
racism functions to further oppress
minorities, whereas black racism just
annoys people. Black racism does not
cause an entire population to suffer
the way that white racism does.
I have sympathy for those who
deny racism. They don't want to be
racist, and there was a time when
they would not have been labeled as
such. But now that the bar has risen;
the big difference is empathy. Our
racial views should not be limited to
the experience of our privilege. Rath-
er, they should be principles based on
empathetic understandings of other
racial groups.

The glory days of tailgating before a Michi-
gan football game seem to be in danger. Many
students remember exiting South Quad as
freshmen and seeing an army of students
proudly wearing their maize football shirts.
The atmosphere was reminiscent of dreams of
what college would be like. There were parties
so full people poured out the front door and
onto the lawns. And on the 900 block of State
Street, rival fraternities who dislike each other
on every other day found common ground -
the State Street block party.
It's a simple fact that the pregame parties on
State Street on Football Saturdays are funda-
mental in the student culture. Every Football
Saturday, students across campus wake up at
8:00 a.m. or earlier to support their school and
their team. Supporters of opposing teams have
to work their way through the flood of maize.
and blue, listen to music blasting and under-
stand that they are in Wolverine Country.
But the way that police have recently been
handling State Street pregame parties has
hushed this culture.
The authorities need to understand that pre-
game parties aren't about getting drunk, acting
inappropriately or engaging in other potentially
dangerous behaviors. It's about enjoying foot-
ball. It's about school pride. It's about knowing
that it's great to be a Michigan Wolverine.
Having spent years in the fraternity system,
we understand how to run a party. The Inter-
fraternity Council has an understanding with
the Ann Arbor police that fraternity parties
will be safe and regulated. This extends to State
Street parties. Our house has always complied
with police officers. We put up fences to ensure
that our parties are contained and don't spill
onto the sidewalks or streets. We try to create
a safe environment in which to tailgate so that
we can have as much fun as possible with little
worry. There's no reason this should be unsat-
isfactory, because safety is ultimately the big-
gest concern.

Since the Ann Arbor police shut us down,
our house alone has received over $1,000 in
fines and bond payments. The city attorney has
referred to us as a "nuisance." In a letter sent to
us, the city cited "rooftop activities and crowds
spilling onto the public sidewalk" as reasons for
concern. As we have made clear, this behavior
doesn't take place. The city's sudden concern is
strange. The city suddenly feels it is necessary
to threaten our neighbors and us with lawsuits,
and it's unclear why. Beneath all the bureau-
cratic political blather from city officials, the
answers are hard to find.
We will concede that in years past, there
have been problems. We are sure that there will
be concerns in the future as well. In order to
deal with those issues, the houses on the 900
block of State Street have and will continue to
be compliant-and respectful of the Ann Arbor
police. Ultimately, everyone wants the same
thing: safety, and to be able to proudly cheer on
the Michigan football team.
We don't think that the intentions of Kris-
ten Larcom, the Ann Arbor senior assistant
city attorney, are to ruin tailgating. But on the
900 block of State Street, that is effectively
what has happened. We like being able to wake
up with our neighbors at 6:30 a.m. to go out-
side and set up our fences while anticipating
the day to come. At the last pregame party, we
looked out from our porch at 9:45 a.m. to see
empty lawns and a quiet State Street. We want
to be able to come back 40 years from now and
see State Street carry on the traditions that we
are fighting to continue now. Saturday is about
facilitating a culture that transcends previous-
ly isolated social networks, and our tailgates
are something fundamental to the Saturday
football experience in Ann Arbor.
Saturdays are about Michigan pride. Have
some.

Don't sweat the swine flu

As H1Nlvaccines become avail-
able this month, the attention
- or lack thereof - to flu pre-
vention has again
become relevant.
The spectrum of
reactions to the flu
ranges from peo-
ple wearing masks
on the way to class
to students joking
about the swine
flu at the sound
of a single cough. HARSHA
People have vary-
ing opinions on PANDMNGA
the dangers of_
HIN - some say
it's all media hype,
while others take extra precautions
in order to avoid contracting the bug.
It's important to take a well-ground-
ed approach to swine flu, since nei-
ther extreme response is suitable.
The University and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention are
taking major initiatives to combat
swine flu's proliferation. The Uni-
versity has implemented an effec-
tive policy, but the CDC may have to
be more careful about the amount of
information it dispenses. The effort
to combat the virus before it actually
becomes a major public health risk
makes sense, but it's important to toe
the line between creating awareness
and inducing panic.,
The CDC is combating H1N1
nationally. Its website includes pub-
lic health warnings and suggestions,
among other information. But even
given that this virus is more conta-
gious than the regular flu and its full
effect is unknown, there may be too
much information. For example, a
person visiting the CDC website will
find it full of swine flu death statistics
and pages and pages describing how
to protect oneself from the virus (even
though the precautions are not much
different than any other airborne ill-

ness), which could provoke unneces-
sary paranoia. The right balance of
information and action is important.
Though the University and CDC
serve different roles, the University
has done an excellent job of run-
ning a campaign that provides the
right amount of awareness about the
virus on campus. We have all seen
the precautionary posters and hand
sanitizer dispensers. These are by
no means excessive and drastic mea-
sures, but rather serve the purpose of
encouraging healthy behavior among
students - especially since areas like
the residence halls are a paradise for
the virus.
Another element of the swine flu
controversy has to do with the vac-
cinations. This topic is hotly debated,
and rightfully so, because it exposes
the conflict between public and per-
sonal health. One of the questions
that arose has to do with whether
the vaccine should be mandated in
high-risk situations. The arguments
in favor of a mandate are strong -
mass vaccination would be likely to
lower the spread of the virus, which
would both improve public health
and protect those who are not vac-
cinated through what is called herd
immunity. In the event that the out-
break becomes worse, especially in
an area such as a college campus, a
large amount of immunized people
on campus wouldn't be a bad thing
at all.
But there are concerns about
mandating vaccinations. First and
foremost, the legality of a mandate
would surely be challenged as a civil
rights issue - as it has been in New
York, which mandated vaccination
among all health care workers in the
state. Reasons given for avoiding the
vaccine include a 1976 precedent in
which people who were vaccinated
for swine flu displayed an unusu-
ally high rate of Guillain-Barra Syn-
drome, a disorder of the nervous

system that leads to paralysis. But
this isn't believed to be linked to the
current vaccine. The issue of per-
sonal choice also arises: Who can tell
you what to put in your body?
6
Moderation is
the best response
to H1N1 fears.
A smart vaccination strategy
would be a moderate one. Instead of
a mandate, a strong recommendation
to get vaccinated would not only be
a less abrasive policy but also a more
effective one. And the CDC has done
this right by recommending that
individuals in high-risk groups get
vaccinated. People would feel less-
contemptuous and may be even more
likely to comply. Additionally, a vac-
tine isn't absolutely required since
the majority of H1N1 cases are not
fatal. The University is also handling
the vaccine situation well by giving
free swine flu vaccinations to all stu-
dents under the age of 24.
By no means should swine flu be
ignored - it is more deadly than
the average flu and has resulted in a
greater number of fatalities in chil-
dren. But amoderate approach, which
incjudes giving the public the appro-
priate amount of information so as
not to spur an inefficient and unnec-
essary overreaction, is important.
The University has done an excellent
job creating awareness of HIN and
providing vaccinations in a high-risk
campus environment. A moderate
policy like the one it has adopted is
the way to go.

A conceptual 'World'

By SASHA RESENDE
Daily Arts Writer
Musician John Darnielle
probably didn't expect to make
his TV debut on the set of a satir-
ical Comedy
Central show. ***
But then again,
what kind of The
artist wouldn't Mountain
want to ben-
efit from the Goats
famed "Colbert The Life of the
bump"? World to Come
Darnielle,
the creative 4AD
force and
the only constant behind The
Mountain Goats, was recently a
guest on Stephen Colbert's late
night comedy show, revealing
the host to be a huge and border-
line nerdy fan of the indie-folk
outfit. Despite recent main-
stream appearances, the band
has maintained a relatively low
profile throughout its career,
releasing a series of albums
with little recognition outside
a small music community. With
the band's 17th (yes, you read
that correctly) release The Life
of the World to Come, the band
explores its poppier roots while
solidifying its rustic sound. The
result is The Mountain Goats'
most accessible album yet.
Darnielle has made a career
on exploring the darker compo-
nents of human emotion, devot-
ing whole albums to an array
of themes ranging from failed
relationships to methamphet-
amine addiction. His band has
perfected the art of the concept
album and its latest release is no
exception. Each of the album's
12 tracks is titled after a differ-
ent biblical verse, providing the
framework for the record's over-
arching religious theme.
The album opens placidly
with a slow-strummed acous-
tic downer that pontificates
on self-help tapes ("1 Samuel
15:23") before progressing into a
mix of pop-rock guitar anthems
and keyboard-based hymns.

"Samuel" is an odd choice for an
opening track, but it succeeds in
orientinglistenersto therecord's
introspective core.
While many of the album's
songs maintain a more upbeat
progression, they preserve the
opener's somber ruminations,
continuing the band's tradition
of exploring melancholy subject
matters. By rotating between
raucous screaming ("Genesis
3:23," "Romans 10:9") and cal-
culated crooning ("1 John 4:16,"
"Genesis 30:3"), the album pro-
vides measured diversity with-
in the confines of its theme and
Darnielle's self-conscious lyr-
ics. Ultimately, The Life of the
World to Come is a varied jour-
ney through Darnielle's self-
discovery, relying on religious
symbols to help its author tell
his story.
"Philippians 3:20-21" strad-
dles both the band's boister-
ous and subdued aesthetics
with a quirky but fairly low-key
drum beat pulling together the
song's light acoustic strings and
dreamy keyboard flourishes.
Darnielle hums the track's typi-
cally caustic lyrics in a voice
barely above a whisper; profess-
ing "Well the path to the palace
of wisdom that the mystics walk
/ is lined with neuroleptics and
electric shocks."
Although there are positive
qualities to both sides of the

group's sound, The Mountain
Goats truly shine when heavy
words are contrasted with
uplifting guitar progressions,
all accompanied by Darnielle's
passionate vocals. To that end,
the charged "Psalms 40:2"
shines as the album's strongest
track and a testament to the
Darnielle's ability to incorpo-
rate intricate storytelling with
powerful instrumentals. Heavy
guitar strings and a persis-
tently strong drum beat frame
its heavy-handed words before
exploding into a tantrum of
Diverse yet
confined.
musical soundscapes, illustrat-
ing the emotions transmitted
by. Darnielle's screaming. It's
a classic Mountain Goats ode,
and after 17-plus recording ses-
sions with the project, it's what
Darnielle does best.
When The Mountain Goats
performed "Psalms 40:2" on
Stephen Colbert's broadcast last
week, the band gelled in front of
a national audience for the first
time. With the group's latest tri-
umph on The Life of the World to
Come, Darnielle's inspired song-
writing should certainly win
over folk enthusiasts.

"Richard II" plays three times this weekend at the Duderstadt Video Center.

' Richard' lives

This campus production of the Shakespeare
classic lets audiences enjoy the fun up close
By Molly McGuire I Daily Arts Writer

There's something illuminating
and fun about the privilege of see-
ing actors rehearse. Before curtain,

as the lights go Video Center
down.
Wednesday's Todayat 7p.m,
dress rehearsal of p.m.oand 1p.m.
the Rude Mechan-
icals' "Richard $3 for students
II" had all of
the pre-performance bustle that
characterizes the week approach-
ing opening night: prop mishaps,
actors all around the auditorium
lunging with swords and practicing
death scenes. But from the open-
ing scene onward the student-run
Rude Mechanicals' adaptation of
Shakespeare's history play was
pure professionalism, and a pol-
ished, poignant, almost relentless
retelling of a British king's journey
from opulent robes to prison garb.
The audience is masterfully inte-
grated into the play, surrounding
the 'H'-shaped stage on all sides.
As a venue, the modern Duder-
stadt Video Center is a bit uncon-
ventional for a classical play, but
staging the production there sig-
pifies a commitment to audience
involvement. The seating configu-
ration nearly puts the audience in
Richard's place, receiving visitors
and settling onto his throne. You're
close enough to see the actor's sali-
va fly through the air during some
particularly impassioned speeches.
And the actors are not limited to
the stage - they wander the floor,
making eye contact with audience

members with such intimacy that
it's impossible to escape from the
action of the play.
"I want a play to hurtle into
an audience from all sides," LSA
senior and director James Mangan-
ello said. "It's not just in-the-round
for the actors, in that they're being
viewed from all sides - the play
also surrounds the audience."
Also surrounding the audience
are video screens bearing images
mainly collected from Russian
montage films. Black and white
scenes of industry and urban land-
scapes accompany the action on
stage.
"The projections were a way to
envelop the audience - to give them
a sense of a larger world outside the
play," Manganello said. "I love the
montage aesthetic, the way they
make you put two seemingly dis-
tinct things together. That's a bit
what I hope to do when I direct:
to be unconfined by 'realism' and
depict a deeper truth that pulls
upon the audience's own cognitive
maneuvers."
This idea of melding two dis-
parate things together resonates
throughout the play. The precise
time period is difficult to discern
(there are trench coats and bowler
hats, swords and guns), but the set-
ting references the Industrial Rev-
olution, which coincides with the
political revolution demonstrated
through Shakespeare's words and
characters.
"(There's) a shift from wealth
being demonstrated by luxury
goods from faraway, exotic places
to a more commodified economy,
in which quantity and profit deter-
mines value," Manganello said.
"Both (worlds) are always in nego-
tiation with each other."
The play examines this shift
while focusing on the more per-

sonal journey of a king becoming
simply a man (with Richard) and an
average man becoming a king (with
his successor, Henry Bolingbroke.)
The play opens with King Richard
in a majestic robe, holding an exot-
ic drink, a parasol draped over his
throne - a tableau unimaginable
at the end of the play. The downfall
of the young and poetic, yet smug
king is sympathetically portrayed
by LSA senior Alexandra Clement-
Jones, especially when he breaks
down, coining in contact with his
mortality in the famous speech
that ends "How can you say to me, I
am a king?" But the king who swag-
gers and smirks in the face of oth-
ers' emotional pleas (the moving
deathbed speech by Manganello's
John of Gaunt comes to mind) can-
not be too sympathetic, and Clem-
ent-Jones balances the two well as
Richard's childlike arrogance turns
to poignant self-awareness.
Like "Hamlet," "Richard II" has a
legacy of actresses playing the title
role, and Manganello maintains
Clement-Jones was simply the best
performer for the part.
"Alex said something to me very
early on in the process-that became
our touchstone for moving ahead,"
he explained. "She said we shouldn't
play Richard as a man or a woman,
but as a creature. That's what we've
done and I'm very, very proud of
her enormous achievement."
Perhaps the most remarkable
thing about the Rude Mechani-
cals' production of "Richard II" is
that it takes a play that could be so
easily dominated by one character
and turns it into an ensemble piece,
with standout performances by
even the actors with the smallest
roles. After all, "Richard II" is the
first in a tetralogy of history plays,
and the other characters must be
left able to carry on the torch. Set-
ting an inauspicious tone for Rich-
ard's successor, the production
both presages what's to come and
represents a self-contained world,
one that depicts Richard's rise and
fall in a fresh and intriguing way.

"It's artistic because the wax is melted."

Science's smartest

By ANT MITCHELL
DailyArts Writer
The Science Channel's first and only game show
"Head Games" is not simply guilt-free TV on an
"educational" network. And it's not just another
show to watch in lieu of doing homework with
only minimal self-reproach.
Instead, it manages to funnel ***
genuinely intriguing informa-
tion and humor into a short half- Head Games
hour slot.S
In "Head Games," contestants
compete to answer a variety of at9 p.m.
questions covering a range of sci- Science Channel
ence-related categories including
natural science, inventions and the sexual practic-
es of a specific type of octupus. The executive pro-
ducer is none other than Whoopi Goldberg, who
also produced "Hollywood Squares" (an old guilty
pleasure of a game show that lasted five seasons).
Greg Proops ("True Jackson, VP") hosts with
hair as spiked as ever, ready to access a collection
of innuendos for all occasions. And the show gives
him ample innuendo opportunity (probably inten-
tionally) with its content.
One of the greatest strengths of "Head Games"
is that it is not geared only to science lovers. Some
might find the show attractive purely out of the
nostalgia induced by the fourth-grade egg and
vinegar trick, and all can appreciate a look at a
genetic trait found in goats causing them to faint
as a survival mechanism.
Basically, "Head Games" manages to hold view-
ers' attention almost entirely because it builds
curiosity. The want to know the-answer to the
questions is more gripping than the competition
on the show. That's not to say that some of the con-
testants aren't quirky characters, though next to a
host like Greg Proops they seem less strange than

would in other settings.
In all honesty, Proops tends to alternate
between hesitantly lovable and somewhat obnox-
ious throughout, never quite slipping permanently
into either description. As a host he fills a central
role, and commentary from him is a given. Clearly
he wasn't chosen for his experience and interest
in scientific information - he holds onto his note
cards quite tightly. Rather, he was picked for his
background in game shows (which is extensive)
and for his wit. Those who don't find him amusing
even while he's in his "hesitantly lovable" phase
will almost certainly lose some patience with his
flamboyant banter and monologues.
Still, whether Proops makes a positive impres-
sion or not, the competition itself lends a certain
amount of low-key excitement to the whole affair,
albeit excitement without too much breath-hold-
ing. If "Head Games" filled an hour time slot like
"The Price Is Right" rather than the taking up its
Nostalgic, funny, brainy
and full of innuendo.
half hour more commonly seen in game shows like
"Jeopardy," the show would likely suffer, possibly
even degenerating into monotony. Luckily this
is not the case, and apart from a few momentary
lapses when the questions get a bit simple. The
show fits well into the time allotted to it.
Audiences will be able to watch "Head Games"
without feeling shame or embarrassment, even
when they're watching it out of sheer enjoyment
rather than for procrastination purposes. During
the show, semi-useless fun facts pop up almost con-
tinuously along the way, which is never a bad thing.

Film
Remaking garbage
"The Stepfather"
At Quality 16 and Showcase
Screen Gems
If there's one token rule
of filmmaking no filmmaker
should ever forget, it's that
sequels, remakes and rip-offs
of remakes are rarely viable as
theatrical material. Unfortu-
nately, the allure of easy money
has apparently induced amnesia
in certain members of the film

industry, and we are now con-
fronted with the unfortunate
consequences.
"The Stepfather" is many
things - generous parts "Dis-
turbia," "The Shining" and of
course, the original "Stepfa-
ther." All of these films contrib-
ute to the abhorrenthodgepodge
that is the sequel, but neither
"scary" nor even "mildly thrill-
ing" would describe the film.
The story begins when Michael
Harding (Penn Badgley, "Gos-
sip Girl") returns from military
school to reconnect with family
and friends.Upon arriving,he dis-
covers that his mother Susan (Sela

Ward,"HouseM.D.")hasfallenfor
a new lover named David Harris
(Dylan Walsh, "Nip/Tuck") and
has remarried. At first, Michael's
homecoming follows the status
quo until he begins to suspect that
his new stepfather may be hiding
sordid details of his past life.
Every aspect of the movie is
slow, boring, and trivial from
start to finish. Even the purport-
edly "shocking" sequences have
no marked effect other than
begging the question, "Haven't I
seen this before?" Unfortunate-
ly, that nauseating sensation of
ddj vu is perfectly justifiable.

Concerns linger
about Rackham's
enrollment policy

Former Daily sports editor, 'U'
Business School alum dies at 27

From Page 1A
Rackham students and the admin-
istration - regarding details of the
plan and answer questions students
felt had gone unanswered.
The second resolution asked
Rackham officials to provide stu-
dents with a written promise that
students be "guaranteed a fellow-
ship or an equivalent source of
funding," as a means of lessening
the financial burden that the new
policy could place on students.
Most doctorate students do not
pay their own tuitions. Instead,
they are paid by a third party, often
the University.
Rackham Dean Janet Weiss said
the policy will continue to go for-
ward as planned. When the policy
was announced last spring, Weiss
set out a timeline, which she said
is still in effect. According to the
timeline, every school with doctor-
ate students was scheduled to come
up with a funding plan, which the
17 schools announced last week.
The next step in the process will
be for the Board of Regents to get
an informal briefing on the status
of the plan, which is scheduled to
take place during one of the board's
monthly fall meetings. In Win-
ter 2010 officials are scheduled to
announce leave of absence policies
and thentraining will beginforstaff
who work with graduate students.
The regents will set tuition rates for
Rackham students in June 2010 at
the same time they set tuition rates
for the rest of the University and
the policy will be implemented in
the fall semester of 2010.
"None of this is actually going to
happen until next September so we
still have 10,11 months to make sure
everything is all aligned," Weiss
said. "But we want to do the plan-
ning as far in advanced as we canson
that people know what is going on."
Rackham student Shaun McGirr
wrote in an e-mail that implemen-
tation of the policy is moving too
fast without taking student input
into consideration.
"Delaying implementation would
be betterthan nothing, but it doesn't
in itself change the fact that this is a
rotten policy with no solid evidence
base in support of it, very little sup-
port amongst faculty and depart-
ment administrators, and almost
zero support amongst the students
it would actually affect," he wrote.
McGirr, who was involved in
the formation of the CEWG, wrote
that one concern is that because the
new plan requires students to pay
tuition for consecutive semesters,
departments will alter their defi-
nitions of "satisfactory progress."
McGirr said that this might require
students to take less time earning
their degrees so that departments
aren't left footing more student
tuition bills.
"Under the current system, peo-
ple can take (a leave) and remain
connected and remain working
and this puts the onus back on the
departments to define what is satis-
factory progress for each student,"
he said. "So we're concerned that
students who have that second kid
and the department is under fund-
ing pressure, they might alter the
definition of satisfactory so that the
department itself doesn't get left
with the bill for your tuition"
Weiss said she believes that fac-
ulty would not alter their definitions
ofsatisfactory progress. She said that
each department receives enough
money to cover their students for

the amount of time that is typically
needed to complete their degrees.
"The definition of satisfactory
progress is very program-based
and faculty-based, and that's what
constitutes progress in our field
toward doing a high-quality dis-
sertation," Weiss said. "So, it's
extremely unlikely that the faculty
would change what they expect in
a student working on a dissertation
because of so-called departmental

tuition fellowship shortages."
Several students have also
expressed concern over the lack
of communication with University
administrators regarding the poli-
cy. McGirr wrote in an e-mail that
the main point students are still
unclear on is why the dean's office
believes the policy would be benefi-
cial to students.
"The evidence base for imple-
menting this is currently just 'We
believe it will be beneficial to
graduate students' - when pushed
repeatedly on scholarly evidence
of a causal (i.e. true) connection
between requiring continuous
enrollment and increased degree
completion," McGirr wrote in the
e-mail. "The dean has admitted
that this evidence does not exist."
Puccio and McGirr said they are
worriedaboutthefutureimplications
of the new policies - like decreased
flexibility for students - and feel
Weiss and other administrators have
only offered vague and incomplete
responses to their concerns.
"The current system, though
flawed in some respects, provides a
non-punitive way of achieving this
flexibility," McGirr wrote in the
e-mail. "Most students we talk to
don't understand why this new pol-
icy adventure has been embarked
upon, at the cost of so much effort,
and stress on graduate students'
part from the poor communication
by Rackham and the unexplored
and unintended consequences of
the policy."
Puccio said although LSA has
come up with a funding plan to cir-
culate to students, the plan is con-
fusing and vague.
McGirr said that while there
was some two-way communication
at the inception of the Continu-
ous Enrollment Student Advisory
Committee, it has become more of
a "funnel" for the administration to
tell students about their decisions
and updates on policy movement
instead of being a forum for stu-
dents to voice concerns.
Weiss countered that there are
many venues for students to voice
their concerns.
She noted that she has met with
many students and groups, like the
working group, and said that she
is willing to meet with any group
that would like information about
the policy.
"It is very much a conversation
and acommunication,"shesaid."We
have used the (Continuous Enroll-
ment Student Advisory Committee)
for a couple of other conversations
as well, but the primary purpose of
the committee from the beginning
has been to help us understand how
students can effectively communi-
cate their questions and concerns
to us and how we could effectively
communicate our questions and
concerns to students."
Weiss added that though some
students are still unclear on the
policy, it will move forward as
scheduled.
"We are trying to make things as
clear as we possibly can. obviously
we haven't succeeded with every-
one yet," she said. "But wehavebeen
trying very hard and diligently."
Though McGirr and other gradu-
ate students and student associations
have had the chance to meet with
Weiss to discuss the policy, McGirr
said that he left those meetings with
many questions unanswered.
"Specific answers came out,
which were interesting but still we
left with the impression that there's
still basically no rationale for the

policy and we're not sure if it's'
financially sustainable in the long
run," he said.
The graduate students involved
in the negotiations are expecting to
receive concrete details about the
plan from administrators later this
semester.

After battle with
testicular cancer,
Sikora passed away
in Los Angeles
By LIBBY ASHTON
For theDaily
Naweed Sikora, a University of
Michigan Business School alum
and a former Michigan Daily sports
editor, died last Friday morning at
the age of 27 after a two-and-a-half-
year battle with testicular cancer.
Sikora passed away in Los Ange-
les, surrounded by his parents,
younger brother and close friends.
His family held the burial that
afternoon.
Throughout his experience at
the University, Sikora balanced his
business school workload and 40 to
50-hour weeks working as a Daily
sports editor, according to one of
his closest college friends and the
Daily's managing sports editor
during Sikora's time there, Brady
McCollough.
Aaron Sub, one of Sikora's house-
mates and best friendsat the Univer-
sity, said Sikora wore many different
hats: that of a deeply religious Shiite
Muslim, an "ever passionate" Wol-
verine fan, a sharp editor and an
intensely dedicated student.
This complexity, Suh said, is
reflected in the various pronuncia-
tions of his first name. "Naweed"
can be pronounced "Nah-weed" or
"Nah-veed," although, on the first
day of their freshman year of col-
lege, he asked that his friends call
him "Weed."
McCollough, who now writes
for The Kansas City Star, said
that although Sikora was talent-
ed enough to work in the field of
journalism, he ultimately entered
the business world, working for
the consulting firm Ernst and
Young immediately after gradu-
ation. He then moved to Hong
Kong, working for a "small, grow-
ing business" based in Orange
County, Calif.
While in Hong Kong, Sikora start-

ed feeling pain in his lowerback and
received medical attention. In the
spring of 2007, he was diagnosed
with testicular cancer. After a con-
stant, aggressive battle with the dis-
ease, Sikora's last month was well
spent, McCollough said.
McCollough said Sikora's fam-
ily had been contemplating a trip
to India to visit a prominent spiri-
tual leader since Sikora received
his diagnosis in the spring of 2007.
They were finally able to fly to
Mumbai this September.
"Naweed met with (the spiritual
leader) for just a couple of minutes
because so many people are meet-
ing with him every day," McCol-
lough said. "Apparently it was a
very emotional experience for him
and this spiritual leader gave him
some peace about his life."
Suh said the trip to India was a
huge personal accomplishment for
Sikora.
"Millions of people want to meet
this man and only a few get to," Suh
said. "He felt better about (that trip)
than probably anything he had ever
done in his life."
McCollough, along with another
one of their friends and Daily co-

workers, Seth Klempner, visited
Sikora in Los Angeles soon after the
family returned from India. McCo-
llough said Sikora's trip to India
seemed to bring positive change to
his condition.
"I expected him to be house-
ridden and in pain but he looked
great," McCollough said. "We went
to an Angels-Rangers game (and)
Naweed wanted to go to Hoot-
ers before the game so we went to
Hooters. We were just 27-year-olds
doing 27-year-old things."
Hopeful that Sikora would be
healthy enough after that visit,
McCollough arranged for Sikora
to attend the Michigan foot-
ball game versus Penn State this
weekend and to be brought down
to the field.
"The last time I talked to
Naweed, I called him and told him
that and he was speechless," McCo-
llough said. "He was so happy."
Starting in February of this year
Sikora maintained a blog called
survivor journey, where he posted
details of his fight against cancer,
like his experience receiving radia-
tion treatments for the disease and
updates from doctors visits.

In April 2009, Sikora posted an
audio clip from a phone call with
former head football coach Lloyd
Carr. In the call, Carr encouraged
Sikora to stay strong, calling him a
true "Michigan man."
In his time on campus, Suh said
Sikora was the glue that held the
members of their house together.
"We each individually consid-
ered Weed our best friend," Suh
said. "He was and still is a source of
inspiration for us."
McCollough experienced the
same feeling of inspiration, espe-
cially near the end of Sikora's life.
He said that during a conversation
he and Sikora had while watch-
ing the Angels game, Sikora talked
about how he should spend the lit-
tle time he had left. He decided that
volunteering at a homeless shelter
felt the most appropriate.
"It totally blew me away," McCo-
llough said. "This is the last per-
son who should be thinking about
anybody but himself. But that's the
kind of guy he was."
McCollough said Sikora's family
is planning a memorial service in
Ann Arbor on Nov. 7. The location
has yet to be determined.

While other states' education trusts are in
peril, Michigan's remains secure, stable

401K or a pension plan or a prepaid
college savings plan," Stanton said.
"Certainly there was an impact in
market fluctuations that started
about a year ago."
The MET - the nation's first-
ever prepaid college tuition plan -
was established in 1986, according
to collegesavings.org, and is now
one of the larger prepaid tuition
plans in the country. It now has
89,615 accounts and a net worth of
$809 million, according to Mark
Kantrowitz, publisher of Finaid.
org - an educational website on
financial aid options.
AccordingtoStanton,the MET's
assets decreased in market value
by about $8 million from Sept.
30, 2008 to Aug. 31, 2009 because
of negative returns in the equity
market.
But despite this downturn in
assets, Stanton said the number
of new accounts being opened has
remained steady, with between
3,200 and 3,500 new contracts
purchased during each enrollment
period.
According to Stanton, the MET
is currently 86 percent funded.
This number is significantly high-
er than some states' plans, which
have projected shortfalls of as
much as 50 percent, said Kantrow-
itz.
"Michigan happens to be one of
the ones that hasn't been affected
as much," Kantrowitz said. "Other
states are much more severely
impacted and so have to make
harder choices."
Kantrowitz said these states'
funds - among them Alabama,

"It's probablyagood ideato have
some buffer of savings if that were
possible in order to make it easier
to get by if you have a hard time
getting a job or to take a particular
type of job that's a good opportu-
nity but maybe lower income than
others," Evans said.
Economics Prof. Matthew Sha-
piro, who was one of the panel-
ists, said the good news is that
unemployment is unlikely to climb
much higher. He added that the

for example - are experiencing an
actuarial deficit because of both
the downturn of the stock market
and the increasing cost of college
tuition.
"Their revenues are down and
their costs are up and that tends to
lead to a shortfall on an actuarial
basis where the current funding
under projections based on rea-
sonable economic assumptions
will fall short of their obligations,"
Kantrowitz said.
Contributing to some prepaid
funds' financial complications is
the fact that many states' plans
are not backed by the state in the
event that the fund doesn't have
the money to cover its investors'
tuition, according to Kantrowitz.
While the MET is not backed
by the state, there is a provision
that allows the program to request
money from the state legislature
if the program is falling short in
funding. But the program has
never employed this provision,
and according to Stanton, it is not
expected that it will in the foresee-
able future.
"Most of (the programs) are sep-
arate entities that are established
by the state but aren't guaranteed
by the state," Kantrowitz said. "So
if they run out of money, then they
run out of money and you might
not have a recourse. So there's a
moral obligation on the state to
make good on the promises and
there's certainly a political obliga-
tion."
Alabama is among those states
whose prepaid college tuition plan
is not backed by the state. It has
experienced actuarial shortfalls,
prompting Alabama's Prepaid
economic growth now is good, but
not great,
"It's very hard to see how
employment will fall much in the
near future," he said.
While the job market may be
tough for recent graduates, Evans
said students still in college will
also experience remaining effects
of the recession.
Evans said many public univer-
sities are encountering budget cut-
backs. He added that sources from
student loans are not as generous
as they were the last few years,
making them more difficult to
come by.

gram to suspend the enrollment of
new accounts.
"You can imagine the uproar
across the state of parents who
can't send their kids to college
because the prepaid tuition plan
failed and there might not actu-
ally be a legal obligation because
of various statements made by
state representatives," Kantrowitz
said. "In the early days of this plan
they were not careful about the
language they used and they used
words like 'guarantee.'"
According to Kantrowitz, a
number of factors like investing
geographically, not using enough
of a mix of treasuries in invest-
ments and investing in real estate
may have contributed to the dif-
ferences between state plans
that are facing financial crisis
and Michigan's financially sound
plan.
The kinds of premiums these
plans offer, their actuarial models
and the amount of tuition increas-
es in these states are also contrib-
uting factors that determine the
success of a state's prepaid fund,
Kantrowitz said.
Stanton said while it is hard to
compare the MET to other states'
prepaid funds to determine what
has caused the difference between
the MET's relative success and lack
of relative success in other states'
programs, the MET's investment
strategies have contributed to its
good standing.
"We clearly invest our funds in
prudent investments (that) help
limit losses," Stanton said. "Over
the years, the MET board and oth-
ers who administer the program
"It's a tough environment for
everybody," he said.
Founder of Computer Trading
Corporation Peter Borish, another
one of the panelists said tuition
around the country continues to
rise, placing more pressure on stu-
dents and their families.
"That is the microcosm of
what's going on in the economy,"
Borish said. "There's tremendous,
tremendous inflationary pressures
underneath."
During the discussion, Shapiro
offered possible exit strategies for
the current economic situation.
He said a monetary policy cur-

have been responsible in maintain-
ing the program, whether it be cur-
rent investments or price increases
when necessary to ensure the pro-
gram remains viable."
Stanton said the recovery of
the stock market in the past few
months hasbeen helpful in further
rallying the MET's funds.
"Since the stock market's low
in March of this year, the market's
up almost 60 percent and that cer-
tainly has benefited, the MET and
other programs that rely on the
market," Stanton said.
Public Policy junior Joseph
Sutkowi, whose family invested
$8,500 in the MET in 1988, said
this money has completely cov-
ered his college tuition, which has
proved helpful with the continued
increase in college tuition.
"The cost of college was rising,
and they kind of imagined it would
probably continue to do the same
and it certainly has," Sutkowi said.
"So it was a way to try defer a cost
that would be really expensive in
the future and do it a little soon-
er and it ended up being a good
investment."
While there are advantages of
using prepaid college tuition plans,
like the avoidance of increasing
college tuition and the investor's
funds being tax deductible, Kan-
trowitz said there is no guarantee
when using a 529 prepaid college
tuition plan.
"If you're investing in these
things for peace of mind, the cur-
rent situation doesn't exactly
engender peace of mind," Kan-
trowitz said. "Ultimately you're
bearing a risk of loss if it's not
backed in full credit by the state."

a similar policy "essentially saved
us from the brink of the next Great
Depression."
Sinai added that with the cur-
rent recovery and remaining
employment concerns in mind,
policymakers are attempting to
accommodate current policies and
foster more economic growth.
"Now the task is to use exist-
ing policies and devise new
ones to make sure the recovery

on a track for full employment,"
Sinai said.

Quick start sparks Michigan

Vaughan fitting

BY NICK SPAR
Daily Sports Writer
The main question for the
Michigan hockey team entering
its home opener against Niagara
last night was whether it would be
already looking forward to Satur-
day's early-season showdown at
No. 3 Boston University.
While-
those NIAGARA 2
thoughts MICHIGAN 3
were put
to rest quickly, the Purple Eagles
still managed to scare the Yost
Ice Arena crowd late in the con-
test.
Just one minute and 47 sec-
onds into the game, Michigan's
home season was off and running
with a goal on the Wolverines'
first shot.
After a Niagara tripping pen-
alty less than a minute into the
game, the fifth-ranked Wolver-
ines wasted no time capitalizing
on the man advantage.
Sophomore Robbie Czarnik
fed freshman A.J. Treais with a
cross-ice pass on the rush, and
Treais one-timed it past a flailing
Adam Avramenko for the first
strike. That early goal helped the
Wolverines to a 3-2 win.
That was just the beginning
of the early scoring surge. Two
minutes later, on the team's sec-
ond shot of the game, junior Carl
Hagelin scored another power
play goal.
This time, the Wolverines
worked the puck around with
sustained pressure in the Niag-
ara zone. A pretty passing play
in the slot between sophomore
defenseman Greg Pateryn and
junior forward Matt Rust left
Hagelin wide open in front for
an easy finish.
Czarnik put the Wolverines up

3-0 with 9:22 left in the first peri-
od; with a goal set up by tic-tac-
toe passing between seniors Steve
Kampfer and Brian Lebler.
But that was when it started to
go downhill.
"We just got comfortable,"
Czarnik said. "We just thought
we were going to blow them out,
and then they came back even
harder."
The Purple Eagles (0-3-1) got
themselves back into the game
with a goal late in the first period,
then cut the deficit in half with
another goal in the second stan-
za.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said at practice this week that he
wanted a fast start in the first five
minutes. He got what he wanted,
but still wasn't pleased with the
performance in the final two
periods.
"As a coach, I'm not happy,"
Berenson said. "Our team needs
to play better than that. Certain-
ly we knew we might be a little
rusty, but we just didn't get better
as the game wore on."
As impressive as the Michigan
power play was in the first period,
it couldn't convert on its final six
chances. Two pucks rang off the
post, and Avramenko stopped
breakaways from junior Louie
Caporusso and sophomore Luke
Glendening.
Junior goalie Bryan Hogan
made 32 saves for the Wolverines
(2-1-0).
Half of those stops came in the
third period, when the Purple
Eagles took control of the game
but couldn't score.
Berenson said Hogan was the
difference in the game, and the
level of play in the offensive and
defensive zones must improve.
"We have to play better with
the puck in our zone, and we have

BY AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
Mary Brandes remembers run-
ning down the field, shouting for
the ball. Thirty years later, she
isn't any quieter. But this time,
she's yelling from the stands.
Mary is a fixture in the stands
at Michigan field hockey home
games and travels to a handful of
away games every year. She isn't
just supporting her alma mater,
but her daughter Eileen as well.
Eileen chuckles when reminded
that she followed in her mother's
footsteps.
"I grew up a Michigan fan,"
Eileen said. "And all of a sudden,
my sophomore year, it hit me: I
do not want to go here. She went
here. I don't want anything to do
with Michigan. I didn't hate it, but
I was like 'nuh-uh'."
Then she changed her mind.

The legacy started 33 years ago
when then-freshman Mary Callam
(1976-79) decided to try out for the
Michigan field hockey team. Title
IV had just passed. Field hockey
scholarships made their debut that
year, but the women's own field
and locker rooms were a distant
dream.
Former Michigan head coach
Nancy Cox was playing for West-
ern Michigan, and she and Mary
met as opponents numerous
times.
Fast forward to 2006. Cox had
moved east from Kalamazoo to
Ann Arbor to coach at Michigan.
Meanwhile, Mary had married and
raised a daughter, Eileen, who was
then a senior in high school. Eileen
wanted to make her own mark as
a field hockey player, not following
the same path as her mother.
After being opposed to being a

What's your most embarrassing moment?
"When I was in sixth grade, at an elementary school dance, there was this
girl I wanted to dance with that I wanted to date. I couldn't build up the
courage to say it. I was talking to my buddies and they were like, 'Man, you
know what, man, you're talking about her so much, why don't you just go
over to her and ask her to dance with you?' And I got myself up to do it.
And I walked up to her and I said, 'Lisa, I'm sure you know me, would you
like to dance?' And she turned around and she said, 'No,' like really, really
loud. There was a microphone right by her so everyone heard it on the
speaker. 'NO,' really loud."
What's your favorite sports rivalry?
"Penn State vs. Ohio State. It's always a tough game playing against those
guys, and I love playing against Jim Tressel, he's a hometown hero for me,
being from Youngstown (Ohio). It's always exciting playing against those
guys, you never know what's gonna happen."
What do you think of the rivalry with Michigan?
"That's another unreal rivalry. It's been a long time since we actually got a
win out there. We have a chance this year t'o do it. I'm really excited about
that game, too."
M Did Michigan's down season hurt the Big Ten?
"I try my best not to pay attention to it. But with Coach Rodriguez coming
in and installing a totally different offense, it's gonna be a little tough at the
beginning. I talked to him myself (in July), and he feels like his guys have
a grasp of everything he wants them to do, and it's gonna be a lot better
this year so everything's gonna be picking up. We get that bad rep of the
Big Ten being weak because of how we've been playing in bowl games. I
don't really believe in that, man. It's just not being able to play that well in
some games - it just happens that way sometimes. I still feel the Big Ten
conference is one of the toughest ones in the country."

MICHIGAN VS.
PENN STATE
The Wolverines have beaten Joe Paterno's Nittany
Lions in nine of the last 10 meetings - of course, the
one loss was last season's 45-17 lopsided affair.
But the last time Michigan lost to Penn State in the
Big House was 13 years ago. Sure, it seems like an long
time since it last happened (except it probably doesn't
for Paterno), but what matters is that this is the Wol-
verines' toughest home game so far.
Will the Wolverines come out firing on all cylinders
for the second-half stretch? Will Michigan make itself
bowl eligible with four games to spare? The answer to
both of those questions will be 'yes' if Michigan can
start anew winning streak over Penn State today.

2009 MICHIGAN FOOTBALL SCHEDULE
Sept. S Western Michigan: Before this win, it had been a while since Michigan
fans had anything to cheer about during opening weekend.
Sept.12 Notre Dame: There's still a looooong time left on that contract, eh, chuck?
Too bad you couldn't beat Michigan in the fifth year of your internship.
Sept.19 Eastern Michigan: The Eagles put up a good fight in the first half, but Michigan
once again proved there's only room for one college football team in washtenaw county.
Sept. 26 Indiana: Wait, what? Indiana still has a football team? We'll believe it when we see it.
And that still hasn't happened, even though it gave Michigan a scare for a few minutes there.
Oct. 3 at Michigan State: So the Spartans beat Michigan for the second year in a row.
Whatever. Keep Paul Bunyan. That thing is butt-ugly anyway.
Oct.10 at Iowa: Kinnick Stadium would rank as one of the best in the Big Ten -if they didn't play
"Gotta Feeling" 3,000,000 times and their fans didn't storm the field against unranked teams.
Oct.17 Delaware State: Imagine how bad it would have been i Rich Rod didn't start
bringing the second stringers in during the second quarter. Yikes.
Oct. 24 Penn State: It's really not that surprising that Joe Pa can't remember when he recruited Tate
Forcier. After all, he can't even remember what he had for breakfast. Or whether he tied his shoes.
Oct.31 at Illinois: After a weak start, the Fighting Illini are almost as irrelevant as chief Illiniwek,
the school's mascot that was discontinued in 2007.
Nov. 7 Purdue: Think the Wolverines still have that hook-and-lateral on their minds? With
Michigan likely to be favored against Purdue this year, expect the Wolverines to come out swinging.
Nov.14 at Wisconsin: It's probably a good sign for the
coach that FireBretBielema.com hasn't
-,"been updated since January, right?
Nov.21 Ohio State: The sweater vest -perfect for when
your torso is ice cold but your arms still need to breathe.
M Seriously, Tressel, what is up with that wardrobe?

GRADY From page 4B

"It's a blessing for the two of
them, they came up together
close, and while they're in school
together, they're still close," said
Alice Whitney, Kevin and Kelvin's
maternal grandmother. "Because
sometimes when brothers are in
sports, they kind of competitive
and they pull away from each
other. But with these two, they
love each other and they support
each other, and I think that's what
makes both as strong as they
are."
FROMTHE HARDWOOD TO
THEGRIDIRON
After Kelvin went from start-
ing eight straight games on the.
Michigan basketball team to play-
ing in garbage time, his departure
wasn't much of a shock.
"I was a little bit surprised, but
I could tell because of his play-
ing time because I know how my
brother's competitive and how he
likes to be on the playing field,"
Kevin said. "Being his brother,
I could tell by that that he was
unhappy about the situation."
Kelvin left the basketball team
and headed back to East Grand
Rapids at the end of the winter
semester in order to sort out his
life, Would he continue to play
basketball elsewhere? Would he
give up athletics altogether?
For three weeks, Kelvin tried to
find those answers while working
the third shift at the Amway plant
in nearby Ada. From 10 p.m. to
7 a.m., Kelvin put caps on lotion
bottles. With each bottle cap, he
debated his past decisions and
contemplated his future.
"It was a humbling experience,"
he said. "To go from college, play-
ing sports, getting a rent check,
going to class, hanging out with
your friends to reality. I was out of
school and I was working - work-
ing in a factory."
It only took a few days for Kel-
vin to realize he didn't want to
spend his life in a factory. College
football had been an option for
him before he chose to play bas-
ketball, and he felt he might fit in
at Michigan Stadium.
Shortly after his time at the
factory, he sought out Michigan
coach Rich Rodriguez and showed
him some his high school high-
lights. The rest is history.
With Kevin already on the
football team, Kelvin sought
out Kevin when he felt football
might be an option.
"He was like, 'You got the
tools,' " Kelvin said. " 'If you
want to come, come in. But if
you do, you need to be all in.
You can't come out here just to

come out here. This is something
serious. This is Michigan football.
This is. something that you have to
really want to do.'"
And what he really wanted to
do was play in the Big House.
LAUGHTER IS THEBEST
MEDICINE
If you have never heard Michi-
gan offensive coordinator Calvin
Magee or running backs coach
Fred Jackson speak, don't worry.
Kelvin can take care of that.
While learning the Michigan
playbook, Kelvin was, of course,
listening to instructions at his slot
receiver position. But between the
X's and O's, Kelvin noticed the
long O's, southern accents and
other sound bytes coming from
his coaches' mouths. He knew
imitation was the highest form of
flattery, so he made the accents
his own.
"Some of the coaches will call
him out to do an imitation of it,
sometimes before or after prac-
tice," Kevin said, noting that Kel-
vin's Coach Jackson impression is
the better of the two. "You might
not even know Coach Jackson,
but the way he does it, we'll have
a riot just laughing at him."
Kelvin said it took him all =
of fall camp and the first
couple weeks of the season
to hone his craft. But picking
upon others' traits is noth-
ing new for the self-pro-
claimed "people person."
Kelvin said he will talk with
teammates from all position
groups, and he likes to find
out unique and interesting
things about people.
But above all he
loves to make
people
laugh.
For the
Wol-
ver-

ines, that's a good thing.
"From the first day he came in,
he fit right in," sophomore tight
end Kevin Koger said. "He gives
comic relief to the team and main-
ly our position group. I love having
him around.
"It's Tuesday, it's Wednesday in
the middle of the week and we're
not feeling too well, and he comes
in always with a smile on his face,
always has a joke to say."
It's natural, then, that Kevin
said the best part about sharing
an apartment with his brother is
the constant laughter.
Senior wide receiver Greg
Mathews doesn't live with the
Gradys, but for him, Kelvin makes
Friday morning Anthropology
class a little more bearable.
"It's tough to go to class at 9
a.m. and pay attention because
it's kind of early, but being in class
with Kelvin, it's just fun because
the teacher usually calls on Kel-
vin, and he usually has something
funny to say," Mathews said. "He
makes a joke and then he'll get
around to answering the ques-
tion."
At Michigan, it's easy for Kelvin
to be in his element. His team-
mates and peers respond fluidly
to his jokes and humor. Laughter
has helped Kelvin fit in, but he's

not about to forget the person he
likes to make laugh most:
His grandmother.
"She's probably one of the peo-
ple I talk to the most," Kelvin said.
"I try to make her laugh as much
as possible. ... I know my grand-
mother really well. I just tell her
lots of jokes. She likes jokes."
Kelvin said the two talk fre-
quently about a range of topics,
and despite their age difference,
they actually have a lot in com-
mon. Alice lives in Grand Rapids
and can't make it down for games,
but watches her grandsons on TV
every week.
"I have 17 grandkids and when
we all get together, we are just
one big, laughable family," Alice
said. "For one thing, (Kelvin's)
very loving. He's very funny. He's
always doing something to keep
me laughing. He just one grand-
son that's always thinking about
his granny and making sure I'm all
right, so I love him for loving me
like that."
Sometimes, Alice must miss
the live broadcast because of choir
practice, but she always watches
the recorded version when she
gets home so she can discuss the
games with Kelvin later.
"Wetalkabouteverything," Kel-
vin said. "She tells me she watches
the game and she's like, 'If they're
going to keep hitting you like that,
I'll have to come out there''"
Luckily, for Alice, the first time
Kelvin got hit, he got right back
up.
YOU'REHIT,NOW WHAT?
Redshirt sophomore wide
receiver. Junior Hemingway
remembers well the first day Kel-
vin put on pads during fall camp.
None of the Wolverines wanted to
miss it.
"We were talking about it like,
'Ooooh, Kelvin's first day in pads,
we're gonna see what you got,'
" Hemingway recalled. "He was
like, 'Man, I'm so small. I haven't
gotten hit in what seems like four
years. I don't know how it's going
to feel. Someone might break my
bones.'"
Luckily for the 5-foot-9, 168
pounder, no casts were neces-
sary.
"I just remember him get-
ting smacked and him getting up
quick," Magee said. "He was kind
of excited about it. He said, 'Man,
at least I got that out of the way.' "
Now, it's not a question if Kelvin
can take a hit, but how far he can
go.
When Kelvin first, contacted
Rodriguez about joining the team
in June, Magee said he immediate-
ly got a phone call from Rodriguez
to examine Kelvin's high school

highlights. Magee was impressed
with Kelvin's play-making ability at
tailback, his ball skills and vision.
But with Michigan already
boasting a deep stable of running
backs, the coaching staff felt Kel-
vin's talents could best be used at
slot receiver.
"That was what we talked about
from the very beginning, because
that's what we look for in our slot
receivers," Magee said. "Most of
our slot receivers are good for-
mer tailbacks. So he had the ball
skills."
It's a formula Rodriguez and
his staff has already proved to be
effective. Darius Reynaud, a cur-
rent Minnesota Vikings receiver
and former slot receiver at West
Virginia under Rodriguez and
Magee, rushed for nearly 2,000
yards his senior year of high
school but never played receiver.
He went to Morgantown and fin-
ished his storied three-year career
with 1,550 receiving yards.
Kelvin's Michigan football story
might not be quite as prolific, but
with two years of eligibility remain-
ing after this season, he could just
be getting started.
"He can be as good as any col-
legiate starter," Magee said "As he
gets another year with (strength
and conditioning coach) Mike
Barwis in the weight room, he's
going to get stronger, he's going
to get faster. I think the sky's the
limit for him. I really think he can
be as good as any other guy at his
position."
When Magee meets with Kelvin
in his Schembechler Hall office, it's
always a worthwhile trip for Kel-
vin. Sitting on Magee's office desk
is a candy dish. Magee doesn't
care for Starburst fruit chews, but
he keeps his dish stocked, just for
Kelvin.
"I think he would choose to eat
Starburst for breakfast, lunch and
dinner if he could," Magee said.
"He eats candy all the time. I know
he's probably excited Halloween's
coming up."
To the staff, Kelvin's worth
keeping around. Magee's small
gesture shows the coaching staff
wants to keep Kelvin happy, and
he clearly is. But probably the big-
gest indicator of Kelvin's potential
success came one week into fall
camp.
Completely unprovoked, Kelvin
approached Coach Magee and
told him that he wasn't looking
back at Crisler Arena. or anything
else. He was a football player now,
and was going to put all of himself
into it.
"I was excited because it's a
lot that the kid volunteered that
on his own," Magee said. "I didn't
have to sit him down and talk with
him about that. ... I took his word
for it."

Breakdown: PSU will squeak past 'M'

By MIKE EISENSTEIN

Daily Sports Editors
MICHIGAN RUSHING
OFFENSE VS. PENN STATE
RUSHING DEFENSE
The run attack will be the
most important part of the
Wolverines' offense this week-
end, and Michigan's ground
game will likely hinge on the
health of one player: Brandon
Minor.
The senior is by far the Wol-
verines' most physical back,
and he adds another dimension
to Michigan's offense. Minor
has also been particularly good
against Penn State, tallying 117
yards and two touchdowns last
season in State College.
Minor's biggest nemesis
has been his ankle. He barely

Penn State's run offense is
second in the conference to
Michigan, which could pose
a problem for the Wolverine
defense. Evan Royster, who is
currently ranked third in the
conference in rushing, will be
the best running back the Wol-
verines have seen all year.
Another big issue for the
Wolverines will be Penn State's
abilitytocontrolthe clock - last
week against Minnesota, the
Nittany Lions had the ball for
nearly 42 minutes. Michigan's
defense has struggled with lim-
iting opposing offenses' time of
possession, and it looks like Sat-

After it took out two weeks

puny Delaware State offense
last Saturday, the defensive line
will face a true test this week.

MAKING THE
BIGHOUSE
HOME
RUTH LINCOLN|DAILY SPORTS EDITOR
Crisler Arena is the home of the Michigan football team's postgame press conference, but for Kelvin Grady, it's more than just an interview room.
Last Saturday, following Michigan's win over Delaware State, Kelvin stood at the podium eagerly answering questions. Smiling widely with his brother
Kevin, a fullback on the team, by his side, Kelvin used the word 'blessed' four times in his short interview. He looked like there wasn't anywhere else he'd
rather be.
It's hard not to think that just a couple hallways away is the Crisler Arena floor, where for two seasons, Kelvin started 33 of 64 games and averaged
4.9 points per game. It's hard not to think that last March he celebrated on the court as the Michigan basketball team's name was called on Selection
Sunday for the first time in 1 years. And it's hard not to think of his former lockerjust another wing away where he celebrated upset victories over Duke
and Purdue with his former teammates.
But as his playing time dwindled to practically nothing last season, Kelvin's thoughts drifted elsewhere. Now, he's refocused with a new set of
Wolverines.
Through the support of his family, his infectious personality and pure athleticism, Kelvin Grady has had an incredible journey.
BROTHERLYLOVE

Inside Kevin and Kelvin's Ann Arbor apart-
ment, a picture hangs prominently on the
wall.
It's from the 2004 MHSAA regional foot-
ball final between East Grand Rapids and
Lowell, Kevin's final high school game. Shortly
before the photo was taken, Kevin had just
fumbled. As the all-time MHSAA rushing
leader sat solemnly on the bench with his head
between his knees, Kelvin, just a 10th grader
at the time, sat beside his older brother.
Amid all the chaos and clamor, Kelvin slid
his arm around Kevin and whispered words of
encouragement into his brother's ear.
"Every time I see it, it brings back that mem-
ory - it just brought tears to my eyes," the
Gradys' father, Kevin Sr., said. "It's just a love
for his brother. Kelvin shares Kevin's pains.
He's that type of kid, he's got a big heart."
Last Saturday, the brothers sat on another
sideline bench, far from the one they shared
five years ago on a cold November night in
West Michigan. This one was inside Michi-
gan Stadium. And instead of mourning defeat,
they relished a much more joyous occasion -
Kelvin's first touchdown.
Moments after freshman quarterback
Denard Robinson found Kelvin steps from
the end zone, Kevin found Kelvin. He lifted
his younger brother high into the air as Kelvin
etched his name into a small part of Michigan
history.

"I've been dying to get in the end zone to
see what it feels like, and it feels great," Kelvin
said. "On top of that, to look back and see my
brother coming and lifting me over my feet,
he dang near threw me over his head - it's
definitely a blessing and these are the types
of moments -and opportunities you work for
to get."
Although they played high school foot-
ball together for just one season, the Gradys
started working together for those moments
far earlier. From AAU teams to their East
Grand Rapids backyard, Kelvin and Kevin
played every major sport together. And they
had the same coach - their father.
The former high school and semi-pro foot-
ball coach trained his sons the same way he
had trained to play sports a generation ear-
lier.
"I'm an old-school disciplined person,"
Kevin Sr. said. "Structured. Old school. Push.
I push. I get the best out them."
During the summer when Kelvin was in
fourth grade and Kevin in sixth, Kevin Sr. would
push his sons every morning - to write.
The brothers would wake up around 8 a.m.,
and Kevin Sr. would have the boys run around
Reese Lake in East Grand Rapids. But before
they hit the road, Kevin Sr. had each boy write
a one-page essay about anything they want-
ed.
"A lot of them were about sports, and me

growing up and wanting to play college foot-
ball, and playing in the NFL and beating Barry
Sanders' rushing records in Detroit," Kevin
recalled.
While they were writing, running or playing
catch, they developed a relationship beyond
any typical teammates. Their family will tell
you Kevin is the laid-back, quiet brother, and
Kelvin is feisty and inquisitive. They might be
best friends, but they are also each other's
fiercest competitors.
When Kelvin was five and Kevin seven, the
brothers were playing basketball at their East
Grand Rapids home. Being the larger, older
brother, Kevin would post Kelvin up and shoot
the ball over his smaller brother.
Kelvin lost. He didn't like it.
So when the boys went into the house, Kel-
vin had a present for Kevin.
"He actually came in the house and threw
a rock at me inside the house," Kevin recalled
with a laugh. "He was so mad that he had
lost."
The rock hit a door instead of Kevin. Kevin
remembers their father wasn't too happy;
Kelvin's a little blurry on the details.
Neither brother has lost their competitive
edge through the years, but their bond has
grown. Despite Kevin's heralded high school
rushing success, Kelvin said he's never tried
to compare himself to Kevin.
