Students at the University 

are taking “going green” to 
another level. 

With 
the 
recent 

construction 
of 
two 
solar 

pavilions, students will now 
be able to socialize while 
powering 
their 
phones, 

laptops 
and 
tablets 
on 

renewable energy on campus. 
The two pavilions are located 
near Palmer Commons on 
Central Campus and the Bob 
and Betty Beyster Building on 
North Campus, respectively.

Business 
junior 
Grant 

Faber, 
vice 
president 
of 

Students for Clean Energy, the 
organization which facilitated 
the 
initiative, 
shared 
the 

group’s 
intention 
for 
the 

pavilions.

After receiving a $25,000 

grant from the Planet Blue 
Student Innovation Fund, the 
Students for Clean Energy 
purchased the pavilions from 
Harvest 
Energy 
Solutions. 

Each pavilion is made up of a 
315W solar panel, LED lights 
for night use, an energy-
storage 
battery, 
four 
AC 

outlets and six USB ports.

“It 
creates 
an 
outdoor, 

solar-powered workspace that 
would serve as an open-air 
space for student collaboration 
and learning, all powered 
by clean energy,” Faber said. 
“Students can now use these 
pavilions day or night for 

studying and hanging out, and 
they will be able to charge 
their devices using 100 percent 
clean energy while doing so.”

University 
alum 
Jayson 

Toweh, former president of 
Students for Clean Energy, 
has high hopes for the solar-
powered pavilions.

“I hope people get more 

of 
an 
awareness 
about 

renewable 
technology 
and 

for more students to have an 

opportunity to engage with 
it,” Toweh said.

The mission of Students 

for 
Clean 
Energy 
is 
to 

encourage the University of 
Michigan to utilize cleaner 
and more renewable sources 
of energy. According to Faber, 
this project helps further 
these goals by helping raise 
awareness about clean energy, 
working to combat climate 
change and attempting to 

begin a motion to reduce 
dependence on foreign oils.

LSA sophomore Anna Kang 

shared her thoughts on the 
new solar pavilions.

“I think people too often 

forget 
about 
how 
their 

decisions 
now 
create 
the 

world of tomorrow,” Kang 
said. “Renewable energy is a 
focus on creating a healthier 
earth for generations to come, 

LSA Dean Andrew D. Martin 

confirmed faculty will place a 
special emphasis on ensuring 
professors hold their exams 
solely during the designated 
exam period in the upcoming 
academic year.

“For many years, the LSA 

Faculty Code—the governing 
document of the LSA faculty—
has mandated that all faculty 
members refrain from having 
final exams on the last day 
of class or during an earlier 
instructional 
time,” 
Martin 

wrote in an email to the Daily.

Students 
who 
still 
have 

classes going on at the time of 
certain exams say they have 
found this to be difficult, while 
others say they appreciate the 
chance to focus on other finals 
or have a lengthier break. 
Regardless, Martin said there 
are adverse consequences in 
pushing up finals they will be 
addressing.

Canadian 
singer-

songwriter 
Mac 
DeMarco 

will be the latest musician 
to grace the University of 
Michigan’s campus thanks to 
a performance slated for Oct. 
21 at Hill Auditorium.

In bringing DeMarco to 

campus, student group Big 
Ticket Productions seeks to 
shake up the general type of 
artists who have come to Ann 
Arbor more recently.

“Looking at the past four 

years, I can’t think of a show 
that was booked by a student 
org at Hill that expanded 
beyond the rap realm so we 
made it one of our goals for 
this 
term,” 
said 
Business 

senior 
Daniel 
Madion, 

artist booker for Big Ticket 
Productions.

Additionally, the change 

of pace is something that 
has been quietly desired by 
students on campus as well.

“Before booking this year’s 

show, we sent out anonymous 
surveys around campus and 
one of the major themes was 
getting a new sound in Hill,” 
Madion said.

DeMarco’s Hill Auditorium 

appearance 
is 
a 
one-off 

performance 
for 
Michigan 

before he ships off for the 
European leg of his tour, 
according to Big Ticket. The 
performance also doubles as 
DeMarco’s first time playing 
in Ann Arbor.

“Not to say that we don’t 

love bringing hip-hop artists 
to campus — they’ve each 
been amazing shows — but 
this year we’re excited to 
represent a different genre 
of music,” Madion said. “Mac 
is 
an 
incredibly 
talented 

musician and we’re so excited 
to have him play.”

Tickets to the performance 

will start at $15 for students 
with valid UM IDs and $25 
for the public. Tickets will 
be available both online and 
in-person at Michigan Union 
Ticket Office beginning Sept. 
7 at 9 a.m.

Transport, military purposes, data collection all possibilities with new space

It’s not a bird, it’s not a 

plane, it’s a new improvement 
to robotics research at the 
University. 

Construction 
began 
last 
month 

for the College of Engineering’s 
new, 9,600-square-foot, 50-foot-
high, 
state-of-the-art 
drone-

testing facility, and will be 
completed by the end of the 
year according to a University of 
Michigan press release. S. Jack 

Hu, vice president for research, 
said the facility will be the best 
of its kind.

“We’re giving our students and 

faculty the most comprehensive, 
safe testing facilities possible 
for these vehicles, which hold 
great promise for a wide range 
of applications,” Hu said.

Varying in size, drones have 

the potential to be used for 
military purposes, transport, 
environmental 
surveillance, 

data collection and package 
delivery, among other things.

The $800,000 project, dubbed 

M-Air, will be a netted, outdoor 
facility, 
which 
aerospace 

engineering 
professor 
Ella 

Atkins says allows testing to be 
as realistic as possible while still 
remaining safe.

“The reason it’s important 

to have an outdoor facility is 
a lot of the hardest questions 
in 
handling 
these 
vehicles 

involve imperfect navigation, 
bad weather, wind, the kind 
of 
environmental 
conditions 

that you can’t really create 
in an indoor space,” she said. 
“It’s just too perfect indoors –– 

the temperature, lighting, no 
precipitation.”

Federal 
Aviation 

Administration 
regulations 

restrict 
researchers 
to 

conducting 
outdoor 
drone 

flights at low altitudes, and only 
to where they can still be seen 
by the operator. Additionally, 
outdoor drone flights on the 
University’s 
campus 
must 

go 
through 
a 
University 

approval 
process 
to 
avoid 

interference 
with 
University 

hospital helicopters and other

45 degrees today. This is 
when the Michiganders 
start to stand out among the 
student masses: By your flip-
flops we shall know ye. 

Football fans looking 

forward to additional perks 

associated with University 

of Michigan wins are going 

to be disappointed this year. 

Ruth’s Chris Steak House 

will no longer be offering 

its Score Big Promotion, 

which gave customers a 

discount of up to 50 percent 

off on their food depending 

on Michigan’s margin of 

victory.

When asked whether the 

promotion would continue 

this year, the restaurant’s 

Facebook page stated it 

would not be valid for 2017, 

replying with, “That was 

2016’s promotion only.”

“Attention #UMfootball 

fans! When Michigan 

wins, you win!” last year’s 

Facebook post read, 

with hashtags such as 

#supportthehometeam and 

#thisishowitsdone included 

in the main body.

Following every UM win, 

the restaurant received an 

overwhelming number of 

reservations and customers 

bringing up the discount.

Michigan’s win against 

Rutgers University last fall 

is likely one of the reasons 

it won’t be bringing the 

promotion back; with a 

78-0 point score, the game 

marked the largest margin 

of victory in approximately 

90 years.

The restaurant quickly 

pointed out its terms and 

conditions capped the 

discount at 50 percent, 

much to the dissatisfaction 

and amusement of multiple 

customers.

Though this deal 

won’t be coming back, the 

restaurant hinted at a new 

surprise to come this season.

FRE E-Z A

Welcome Week has come 

and gone — but with every 
year comes a controversy and 
the question of safety and 
inclusion with Greek Life and 
student-run parties. 

Themed parties

A trend often seen is the 

adoption 
of 
a 
minority’s 

cultural 
traditions 
by 
a 

majority 
group, 
called 

cultural appropriation.

This 
summer, 
the 

University’s chapter of the 
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity 
recently faced criticism for a 
planned Ancient Egyptian-
themed party, which was later 
canceled after facing backlash 
from 
University 
student 

activists and social media.

The 
fraternity’s 
now-

deleted Facebook invitation 
invited people to “honor our 
Egyptian roots and join us 
on the night of September 1st 
to celebrate our newly built 
pyramid” and “come to Delta 
Sig as a mummy, Cleopatra 
or King Tut it doesn’t matter 
to us. Get your best ancient 
Egyptian robe and headdress 
and be ready to party in the 
desert. Be careful though, it’s 
going to get HOT.”

Business junior Yasmeen 

Afifi, 
president 
of 
the 

University’s 
Egyptian 

Student Association, voiced 
her concerns about the party 
theme in a Facebook post. 
As an Egyptian herself, Afifi 
found 
the 
party’s 
theme 

disrespectful.

“It is more saddening to see 

students from the top public 
university in the United States 

engaging in these ignorant 
stereotypes,” she wrote. “My 
Egyptian roots are far more 
significant 
than 
a 
simple 

costume or a lame party.”

University 
members 
of 

Delta Sig were unable to 
comment on the situation. 

The situation echoes the 

2013 Theta Xi incident, when 
the University’s chapter of the 
frat planned to host a “World 
Star Hip Hop Presents: Hood 
Ratchet 
Thursday” 
party. 

The party was canceled due 
the theme’s appropriation of 
Black culture which offended 
many. 

The invite page, hosted by 

now University alum Allen 
Wu, 
called 
all 
“rappers, 

twerkers, gangsters (no Bloods 
allowed), 
thugs, 
basketball 

players, bad bitches, ratchet 
pussy.”

Wu went on to justify the 

party’s theme by stating it 
was directed toward hip-
hop music, not African 
American 
culture. 

In 
an 
opinion 
piece 

published by the Daily, 
Wu explained his longing 
for 
a 
society 
where 

music 
genres 
are 
not 

immediately 
associated 

with a racial identity.

“It pains me to see 

that 
‘hip-hop 
parties’ 

are 
immediately 
cast 

under a racial lens, even 
if not so intended,” Wu 
wrote. “Just because we 
celebrate and enjoy the 
music and terminology 
used by predominantly 
Black 
hip-hop 
artists, 

that does not mean we are 
attempting to appropriate 
Black culture.”

Wu 
still 
received 

disapproval. 
Due 
to 

students’ concern with 
the party’s theme, an 
email 
from 
University 

officials 
condemning 

the party was sent to all 
students. The email was

students 
that 
deviating 

from this policy has adverse 
consequences for some of our 
students,” Martin continued 
in the email. “This a special 
emphasis of the dean’s office 
this year, making clear that it is 
our expectation that exams are 
administered during the times 
established by the Registrar’s 
Office.”

LSA junior Meghan Clark 

said she is concerned whether 
the new emphasis on changing 
exam times will affect travel 

plans for returning home over 
Winter Break.

“Typically, the only exams 

I 
had 
before 
finals 
were 

scheduled that way because 
they were late in the week,” 
she said. “Being from across 

the country, I’m worried this 
new rule could make it more 
difficult for me to travel home 
for breaks.”

LSA junior Ellie Wilson 

echoed this concern, stating 
it is easier to plan for breaks 
knowing exams can be held in 
the final week of class. Yet, she 
noted that professors adhering 
to 
the 
LSA 
code 
prevent 

multiple exams on the same 
day.

“On one hand, it’s nice to 

plan ahead knowing that exams 
are during the last week,” 
she said. “However, it can be 
very difficult when finals for 
various classes overlap.”

signed by E. Royster Harper, 
the University’s vice president 
for 
student 
life, 
Dean 
of 

Students Laura Blake Jones 
and Greek Life Director Mary 
Beth Seiler.

“We 
were 
deeply 

disappointed to learn that 
members 
of 
a 
university 

fraternity had planned an 
offensive 
themed 
party 

for 
November,” 
the 
letter 

stated. “The language of the 
invitation and theme of the 
party denigrated all women 
and African American/black 
identified 
people 
through 

racial stereotypes and cultural 
appropriation.”

The 
hashtag 
#BBUM 
— 

Being Black at the University 
of Michigan — was started by 
the Black Student Union as a 
reaction to the party theme.

The 
hashtag 
has 
grown 

into a movement that has 
sparked national conversation 
about diversity and inclusion 
on campus. When the Theta 
Xi party theme broke to the 
public, 
the 
Black 
Student 

Union twitter account posted 
a screenshot of what appears 
to be an email, denouncing the 
party’s theme.

Cultural appropriation from 

frats is an often heard tale: 
In May, the Baylor University 
chapter of Kappa Sigma frat 
was 
suspended 
for 
their 

“Cinco de Drinko” party in 
which students came dressed 
in sombreros, some in brown 
face. In 2016, Bowdoin College, 
in Maine, had a similar party. 

For Afifi, the issue of white 

people appropriating minority 
cultures spans wider than 
Greek Life at the University. 
She wrote on Facebook she 
believed 
these 
fraternities, 

made up of predominately 
white males, need to step back 
and recognize their place in 
society as a majority group. 
Considering 
throughout 

history white people have 
oppressed minority groups, 
Afifi 
wrote 
she 
found 
it 

inappropriate 
for 
these 

fraternities 
to 
comfortably 

craft these themed parties. 

“This is much larger than 

just a party; it is the privilege 

that led this frat to think 
this was remotely okay that 
needs to be analyzed. White 
people need to cognizant of 
their identity and their role 
throughout history,” she wrote 
on her public Facebook post.

Safety

At the bottom of many 

events on Facebook, hosts 
include a warning message.

Debs 
Cooperative 
House 

has 
previously 
included 

the statement: “No racism, 
homophobia, sexism or any 
other forms of being a dick is 
allowed here. Don’t be that 
person.”

A former social fraternity— 

known as a metal frat — 
hosted a “300 Underwater 
New Year’s Party” on Sept. 2. 
The Facebook invite page read: 
“ABSOLUTELY NO SEXIST, 
RACIST, 
HOMOPHOBIC, 

TRANSPHOBIC, 
ABLEIST, 

ETC 
BEHAVIOR 
OR 

LANGUAGE 
WILL 
BE 

TOLERATED. THOSE WHO 
VIOLATE 
OTHERS 
AND 

CREATE 
DISCOMFORT 

WILL BE REMOVED FROM 
THE 
PARTY 
AT 
THE 

HOUSE’S 
DISCRETION. 

DON’T BE THE WORST.”

In some cases, fraternities 

have 
made 
it 
clear 
that 

behavior deemed culturally 
inappropriate 
will 
not 
be 

tolerated, 
but 
there 
still 

remains a question if this 
warning 
to 
partygoers 
is 

enough. 
One 
University 

student, who is in a fraternity, 
said although his organization 
never 
puts 
out 
a 
direct 

disclaimer, good behavior at 
their parties is expected. 

“It 
is 
understood 
and 

assumed that that type of 
behavior 
is 
unacceptable. 

Honestly, we tend to stay 
away from any kind of parties 
with a theme that’s a country/
religion/etc.” he said.

Members 
of 
Greek 
Life 

claim 
these 
incidents 
of 

inappropriate behavior have 
occurred rarely in previous 
years. Yet, it still remains an 
issue fraternities and hosts 
must be consciously aware of 
when throwing a party. 

“It’s just important to be 

upfront about our inclusive 
policy,” LSA junior Summer 
Stern, “300 Underwater New 
Year’s Party” co-host, said. 
“It’s important to us that 
people feel OK in the house.”

One 
LSA 
junior, 
who 

requested 
to 
remain 

anonymous, said they find 
Greek Life to be “inherently 
sexist.” 
They 
went 
on 
to 

explain fraternities are free 
to 
plan 
parties; 
however, 

sororities would be punished 
and/or banned if they did the 
same.

“In regard to each party, 

I think it is no different than 
a regular house party or bar 
scene, excluding the every-
so-often case of inappropriate 
sexual 
behavior 
that 
is 

sometimes 
reported 
and 

sometimes not,” they said.

An LSA senior, who is in 

Greek 
Life, 
believes 
these 

types of written statements 

are 
“a 
step 
in 
the 
right 

direction.” The student said 
though the statements have 
good intentions behind them, 
they often fall short of solving 
the 
issue 
of 
inappropriate 

behavior.

“I 
think 
ultimately 

individuals are going to make 
mistakes, whether it be a 
simple slip up or purposefully, 
and it is always hard to 
control people who are not 
initiated members of your 
organization,” 
the 
student 

said. 
“Nobody 
can 
force 

another how to act or speak, 
but we can all encourage one 
another to make good choices.”

An LSA junior in Greek 

Life who requested to remain 
anonymous, does not think the 
written statements accomplish 
much. While the statements 
are 
meant 
to 
eliminate 

negative behavior, they may 
not do enough to stop the issue 
from happening.

“Despite the disclaimer, it 

does not ensure that people 
don’t show up to the party 
degrading 
a 
racial/ethnic 

group,” 
this 
student 
said. 

“However, I believe it is a good 
effort from the frat and shows 
a good intention that they are 
putting the disclaimer out 
there.”

Nevertheless, 
the 
issue 

of 
cultural 
appropriation 

across the campus, to some, 
is growing. The University 
recently 
created 
a 
new 

position: 
a 
“bias 
incident 

prevention 
and 
response 

coordinator.”

“The core work of the 

Dean 
of 
Students 
Office 

includes promoting a safe, 

respectful, 
healthy, 
and 

inclusive campus community, 
enhancing students’ Michigan 
experience, providing support 
services 
and 
managing 

critical incidents impacting 
students 
and 
the 
campus 

community, and recognizing 
and responding to emerging 
needs 
within 
the 
student 

population,” 
the 
University 

of Michigan’s website stated, 
according to the article. 

The Daily reached out to 

multiple 
official 
chapters 

on campus, who in return 
declined to comment.

sell political gear was purely a 
business experiment, based on 
current nationwide cultural 
trends.

“It’s 
just 
something 
we 

were kind of messing around 
with on Amazon,” Narayan 
said. “We’re not making a 
political statement in any way. 
… It’s just what’s out there in 
Americana. Like, there are cat 
T-shirts, too. Sometimes we 
just try to follow some of those 
trends.”

As a custom shirt company, 

Narayan said giving customers 
ways to express themselves 
is their primary goal, and 
wearing political merchandise 
is an important way to do 
that for people of all political 
parties. Furthermore, Narayan 
added the company initially 
felt it was important to create 
merchandise for both sides 
of the aisle to stay politically 
neutral.

“Ultimately, our customers 

are just expressing their ideas 
and opinions,” he said. “We do 
sell a variety of different types 
of shirts on Amazon and other 
platforms … but our position 
is that we’re going to help our 
customers express themselves 
and we should always take 
a neutral standpoint so that 
we’re helping our customers 
express whatever their ideas 
are.”

However, 
this 
August, 

Underground Printing decided 
to halt its sales of political 
clothing for the time being. 
While there was no outright 

backlash to its merchandise, 
Narayan said the company 
worried it would make some 
customers feel uncomfortable 
coming to UGP with their 
apparel orders.

“There hasn’t been (any 

backlash),” he said. “We have 
decided due to recent events 
that we feel like the best 
way to remain nonpartisan 
is to remove ourselves from 
any kind of political shirt on 
Amazon. For us, it’s super 
important that someone who 
is 
conservative 
or 
liberal, 

Republican or Democrat, to 
feel comfortable coming to us 
and printing their shirt.”

Narayan 
emphasized 

Underground 
Printing 
does 

not tolerate apparel orders that 
promote hate or violence, but it 
also wants to protect the role 
clothing plays in freedom of 
expression.

“So as long as it fits within 

our content requirements, we 
feel like it’s not our position 
to make commentary on what 
someone is saying, and we 
felt like with the emotion 
tied around it, we felt like the 
best way to handle it was to 
step away from that arena,” 
Narayan said.

Members of the University 

community 
felt 
mostly 

ambivalent about Underground 
Printing’s foray into political 
merchandise. 
LSA 
senior 

Enrique Zalamea, president of 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, applauded UGP’s 
business acumen in all parts of 
the experiment.

“Kudos to them for taking 

the opportunity to make some 
more money and expand into 

more markets,” Zalamea said. 
“(But the fact that they’ve 
stopped selling the shirts) 
doesn’t come as a surprise 
given that a good business 
would stop selling irrelevant 
merchandise … the elections 
were a year ago, I don’t think 
many people would buy Hillary 
or Trump campaign shirts 
anymore.”

Public Policy senior Rowan 

Conybeare, 
chair 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, 
agreed 
with 

Zalamea 
that 
Underground 

Printing was just making a 
good 
business 
decision 
by 

moving 
into 
the 
political 

sphere. She said she feels 
the whole process is pretty 
noncontroversial.

“I don’t think that it sends 

that strong of a message,” 
Conybeare said. “If they were 
selling both Democrat and 
Republican gear and they only 
pulled one of them, that would 
have sent a stronger message. 
This is just showing they 
don’t want to get involved in 
politics.”

When asked if Underground 

Printing would ever venture 
into the world of political 
merchandise again, Narayan 
said the company wouldn’t 
cross it off the list, but he 
doesn’t see it returning to it 
any time soon.

“I don’t want to say no, we’d 

never sell it again, but I think 
that right now we feel like it’s 
not a good area to be in if you’re 
trying to stay nonpartisan,” 
Narayan said. “It’s easy to 
seem like you’re supporting 
one or the other.”

which, for me at least, seems 
like a small sacrifice to make 
throughout our daily lives.”

The 
2016 
annual 
report 

from the University’s Planet 
Blue stated that, compared 
to 2006 levels, the University 
has reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions by 5 percent and has 
achieved a 10-percent reduction 
in 
energy 
consumption 
in 

general fund buildings. Faber, 
however, believes more can be 
done.

Faber 
suggested 

implementing 
a 
power 

purchase agreement, otherwise 
known as a PPA. A PPA is a 
contract between a producer of 
energy and a buyer. Faber cited 
Michigan 
State 
University’s 

current PPA, which provides 

5 percent of its electricity 
through solar power and could 
save the university $10 million 
over the next 25 years.

“Our society must shift to 

using primarily clean energy 
for 
a 
myriad 
of 
reasons, 

including but not limited to 
economic 
competitiveness, 

national 
security, 
grid 

reliability 
and 
resiliency, 

reduction of pollution, fuel 
independence and mitigation of 
climate change,” Faber said. “I 
firmly believe that UM has the 
power to be a leader in ending 
the fossil fuel era and to claim 
all of the benefits from doing 
so.”

Toweh shared the future 

achievements he would like 
to see due to the impact of the 
solar-powered pavilions.

“I’d like to see more rooftop 

solar panels,” Toweh said. “I’d 
like to see more buildings, like 

the libraries, dorms or Angell 
Hall to have these.”

Kang said she believed it is 

important to emphasize clean 
energy practices within the 
University.

“Having a platform to speak 

out from is always a blessing 
to have, and the University has 
an extremely large platform 
itself,” Kang said. “Distributing 
these ideas through a well-
known name will help to 
spread the lifestyle and attain 
the ultimate goal of a better 
earth.”

The 
two 
pavilions 
will 

provide students with a new 
space to study and relax, while 
providing an easy, clean way to 
power their devices.

When asked whether she 

planned on using the pavilions, 
Kang responded confidently:

“I think it goes without a 

doubt that I would.”

aircraft. The M-Air facility 
will technically be considered 
indoors, therefore test flights 
taking place within it do not 
require any such approval.

“The FAA regulations don’t 

guarantee 
safety. 
They’re 

intended 
for 
responsible, 

experienced 
pilots, 
and 
on 

more tested systems,” Atkins 
said. 
“Our 
students 
aren’t 

experienced 
pilots. 
They, 

and our faculty members, are 
building new hardware that’s 
not necessarily going to work 
the first, second, third or even 
the fourth time.”

And mere yards away, the 

University and Ford Motor 
Company will be partnering 
to 
begin 
construction 
of 

the $75 million, four-story, 
140,000-square-foot 
Ford 

Motor 
Company 
Robotics 

Building later this fall, which 

will house a three-story, indoor 
drone “fly zone” with a more 
interactive environment than 
M-Air.

Together with Mcity, the 

expansive, 
state-of-the-art 

autonomous 
vehicle-testing 

facility just down the road, 
the 
Marine 
Hydrodynamics 

Lab, M-Air and the Ford Motor 
Company 
Robotics 
Building 

will 
provide 
students 
and 

faculty unfettered access to 
the full spectrum of robotics 
testing.

Alec Gallimore, the Robert 

J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering, 
said the addition gave the 
University 
unique 
national 

standing in engineering.

“When 
M-Air 
opens, 

Michigan Engineering will be 
the only engineering school in 
the country — perhaps in the 
world — with access to cutting-
edge robotic test facilities for 
air, sea and land,” he said. “This 
is a key piece in our long-term 
plan to give our faculty and 

students best-in-class resources 
as they work to solve society’s 
greatest challenges and most 
exciting opportunities.”

Atkins said the possibilities 

for the facility are endless.

“We have a need for a safe 

flight area to try out anything 
students want to fly in a way 
that doesn’t place at risk people, 
other aircraft, cars, et cetera, 
so having this netted facility 
allows that to happen, whether 
it’s a freshman bringing a 
gadget with them from home 
and they want to try it out, or 
whether it’s a student team or 
a class or a Ph.D. student trying 
to do some elaborate research,” 
she said.

She added it won’t be just 

for students and faculty to use 
–– the College of Engineering 
is hoping to use the facility 
to host outreach events for 
the community, from races 
to design contests, “or just 
supporting 
robotics 
in 
the 

community in general.”

We were deeply 

disappointed 
to learn that 
members of 
a university 
fraternity had 

planned an 

offensive themed 

party 

It is the privilege 
that led this frat 
to think that this 
was remotely okay 

that needs to be 
analyzed. White 
people need to be 
cognizant of their 

identity


S

tephen Bannon’s ouster 
from the White House 
brought 
the 
sort 
of 

speculation 
we’ve 
heard 
a 

number of times before: Is the 
Trump 
administration 
stable 

enough to continue functioning? 
Core members are in and out 
at the president’s whim, staff 
members lie, cheat and steal for 
a slim personal advantage and 
the work atmosphere is more 
“Game of Thrones” than “The 
West Wing.” 

I am inclined to believe that 

Bannon’s removal will benefit 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Trump 

administration and the country 
overall. The “deep state” has 
outlasted its primary enemy 
and will be able to properly 
resume 
its 
work: 
actually 

running the country.

Removing Trump’s advisers 

is not a fix because the ultimate 
source of instability in the White 
House 
isn’t 
Bannon, 
Reince 

Priebus or Michael Flynn — 
it’s Trump himself. That said, 
removing Bannon removes one of 
the last lucid powers in the West 
Wing, one with the attention 
span and future vision to carry 
out effective — albeit disastrous 
— change. I see this as enabling 
the “deep state” to further 
restrain the president.

The 
way 
we 
consume 

political news in this country 
requires a core narrative of 
dynamic 
characters 
— 
the 

beleaguered chief of staff, the 
malevolent 
chief 
strategist, 

the strategically patient vice 
president — and as a result, 
we often see their actions as 
much more consequential than 
they really are. Despite all that 
has happened, Congress still 
functions. The judiciary still 
functions. And — though it has 

some trouble with Trump — the 
executive branch still functions.

Our 
government 
was 

designed to be slow-moving and 
cumbersome — to be a massive 
shipping barge, not a skip. Trump 
and his companions may loot 
what they can while they’re in 
power, and the man himself 
may do some cultural damage in 
covering for white nationalists, 
but the captain cannot sink his 
ship without the help of his crew.

When 
Trump 
axed 
U.S. 

support for the Paris climate 
accord, lower-level executives 
— governors and mayors — 
contradicted him and offered 
their continued support. French 
President Emmanuel Macron’s 
own ambitions certainly played 
a large part in keeping the accord 
together, but I think these lower-
level promises also played a 
significant role. A child-king’s 
advisers have the real power. 
Their deals are the ones that 
succeed and their promises are 
the ones that are upheld.

A similar dynamic is playing 

out in the United States, as 
states and cities conduct pseudo-
foreign policy. There is also the 
issue of political donors when 
we’re discussing the Americans 
with legitimate access to power. 
Trump was not all that popular 
when it came to campaign 
contributions, 
and 
“alt-right” 

figures modeled in his image 
are likely to fare even worse. 
U.S. elections depend heavily 
on access to funds, especially 
when we step back from the 
presidency and consider lower-
level elections.

Finally, I’d like to address 

the delusion that Bannon and 
company will be more powerful 
now that they “have (their) hands 
back on (their) weapons.” As 

Cersei Lannister from “Game 
of Thrones” put it, “power is 
power.” 
Money, 
knowledge 

and speech are all ancillary 
to the cold reality that, once 
installed in office or position, 
power rests with the politician. 
Breitbart 
propaganda, 
white 

nationalist rallies and thinly 
veiled “free speech” protests are 
all legitimate dangers, but when 
a mayor says the statues are 
coming down, they come down. 
When a governor says to make 
the racists disperse, the police 
disperse them.

The delusion that a media 

campaign against the government 
will be effective thrives on the 
same desperation that brought 
the “alt-right” to prominence in 
the first place: a desire to be the 
victims, even when all evidence is 
to the contrary; a desire to be the 
underdogs, even when they have 
significant institutional power. 
The “alt-right” is, as a result, 
condemned to live in a perpetual 
struggle: When you are defined 
entirely by powerlessness, power 
destroys you.

I don’t want to gloss over the 

legitimate problems posed by 
Trump’s position and the damage 
he can do. We have more than 
three years left with an executive 
who is unwilling to learn, at 
the mercy of his emotions and 
completely immune to nuance. I 
do, however, want to push back 
on the frantic terror that we will 
imminently be swallowed up by 
the racists, once again ascendant 
and ready to implement their 
ideas as real policy. Only power is 
power, and they are incapable of 
wielding it.

A

s leaves start to change 
color and classes begin 
this fall, a wave of 

football hype spreads across 
campus. For many University 
of Michigan students, the 
return of the football season 
provides 
relief 
from 
the 

classroom — a part of a work 
hard, 
play 
hard 
mentality 

that is a uniting force across 
campus. For many, NCAA football 
takes a backseat to professional 
football come Sunday. 

The NFL, a weekly refuge 

from 
work 
for 
countless 

students and employees, has 
now captured the attention of 
the vast and lucrative fantasy 
football community that is 
perhaps most crucial to the 
league’s consistent success.

But the rise of the NFL 

has come with a fair share 
of 
problems, 
earning 

unfavorable media attention 
for the concussion epidemic 
and domestic violence issues. 
Despite 
fantasy 
football’s 

growth 
into 
a 
booming 

industry, it has worked to hide 
and 
ultimately 
perpetuate 

the prevalence of domestic 
violence across the league.

The NFL and Commissioner 

Roger Goodell have come under 
fire for their mistreatment 
of various domestic violence 
cases in the past few years. 
NFL players Ray Rice, Josh 
Brown and Ray McDonald 
were all suspended on domestic 
violence allegations, but many 
claim their punishment did 
not match the violent nature of 
their crimes.

In the case of Rice, a video 

surfaced 
of 
him 
violently 

beating 
his 
wife, 
Janay 

Rice, in a hotel elevator. 
For 
someone 
without 
the 

privilege and fame of a three-
time pro-bowler and Super 
Bowl champion, this type 
of concrete evidence could 
lead to jail time. Instead, the 
NFL “cracked down” with a 
measly two-game suspension 
— the same penalty that has 
been handed out for failing a 
drug test.

In the wake of their actions, 

the NFL received tremendous 
backlash 
and 
moved 
to 

harshen their protocol for 
sexual assault and domestic 
violence punishment.

However, this topic remains 

at the forefront of the league 
and has resurfaced in the past 
few months. Ezekiel Elliott, 
a Dallas Cowboys first-round 
draft choice, allegedly abused 
his 
then-girlfriend 
Tiffany 

Thompson in July 2016, for 
which he faced a six-game 
suspension as of August 2017. 
Though this is a step up from 
the NFL’s weak punishment 
in past cases, the severity 
of the allegations is clouded 
out by the very reason Elliott 
garnered so much attention on 
the field — fantasy football.

One read through ESPN’s 

fantasy 
website 
reveals 
a 

string of articles and videos 
about Elliott, but virtually 
none of them comment on 
the morality and character of 
his actions. Rather, the main 
theme is: “Where will Elliott 
be drafted?” By focusing on 
Elliott’s draft position and 
projected points for the year, 
talk about the second-year 
running back has gradually 
moved away from his domestic 
violence case.

Masking the severity of 

these cases is a dangerous 
trend that elevates the status 
of athletes and causes them 
to deviate from social norms, 
offering them an excessive 
sense of pride, or hubris, 
and the belief that they can 
commit illegal acts and still 
get away with it.

Earning millions of dollars 

should not earn any athlete 
a free pass from domestic 
violence. Glorifying superstars 
for their statistics and treating 
them as tradable commodities 
creates a sense of immortality, 
potentially leading to more 
violence in the future. If 
anything, spectators and the 
media must strive to hold 
athletes to a higher standard, 
especially as fantasy football 
opens up an escape route for 
players 
whose 
performance 

attracts so much attention.

It is this relationship between 

sports and the media, as one of 
the most influential in the entire 
entertainment 
industry, 
that 

allows companies like ESPN and 
Fox Sports to shape and alter public 
opinion through their coverage.

Once SportsCenter, ESPN’s 

flagship 
program, 
takes 
a 

stance on an issue, especially 
a sensitive topic like domestic 
violence, it has the tendency to 
become the main perspective 
viewers take as well. While 
nearly 
monopolizing 
the 

world of sports, ESPN has 
used its power to alter the 
timing of the NFL Draft, 
the 
schedule 
of 
NCAA 

football 
games 
and 
the 

entire conference structure. 
Because of its influence, the 
station has a responsibility to 
maintain moral high ground 
on any and all controversial 
topics. Even as football season 
approaches 
and 
viewers 

demand 
predictions 
and 

rankings for the upcoming 
year, the network should not 
allow for turning a blind eye 
to domestic violence.

Thus, 
as 
ESPN 
fantasy 

insider 
Matthew 
Berry 

continues to harp on Elliot’s 
second-round 
draft 
value, 

the public too will continue 
to forget his act of domestic 
violence. Even as the NFL 
harshens 
punishments 
and 

speaks out against these cases, 
it has found an opponent in 
fantasy football.

As participants, we must 

also play a role. To neglect 
domestic violence and sexual 
assault because of an athlete’s 
performance sets the stage for 
continued 
violence 
against 

women, 
a 
scary 
prospect 

given the safety net handed 
to these athletes. On our 
campus, 
domestic 
violence 

awareness 
and 
prevention 

is a constant and impactful 
theme. There are numerous 
lectures, counseling resources 
and 
programs 
devoted 

to 
eliminating 
domestic 

violence from our community, 
especially among athletes.

As students, we have the 

duty to make use of these 
resources and be upstanding 
citizens if and when a situation 
arises — either in person or 
through an online draft board. 
So even if Elliott is available 
when it comes to your pick, 
give it some consideration. 
Maybe don’t take him at all.

KEVIN LIU | OP-ED

T

his 
past 
summer, 
I 

attended Basic Airborne 
Course at Fort Benning, 

Ga. BAC is a three-week course 
where service members from 
all branches attend to become 
qualified in successfully exiting 
an aircraft and landing on 
the ground, minimizing any 
injuries. The first two weeks 
are a training phase where BAC 
students learn how to properly 
exit an aircraft, conduct a 
parachute landing fall, use the 
main and reserve parachutes 
and prepare for emergency 
landings. Jump week is the 
culminating 
week 
where 

students 
must 
successfully 

conduct five jumps from an 
aircraft. From my five jumps, 
I was able to remind myself 
of key takeaways that have 
affected my career at the 
University of Michigan. 

Jumping into the unknown: 

When you’re inside the aircraft, 
be it a C-130 or C-17, you 
typically aren’t the first person 
to jump out of it. The advantage 
of being the first person to jump 
out of the aircraft is that you can 
observe the drop zone prior to 
jumping out of the door and thus 
has a clear view of what you are 
jumping into. In my experience, 
I was typically placed in the 
middle or the rear of the line in 
performing mass-exit jumps. 
Here you can only see the 
people in front and behind you. 
Once the jumpmaster signals 
“Green light, GO,” you have no 
choice but to move forward and 
jump without hesitation into 
the abyss.

Tying 
this 
in 
with 
my 

experience at the University, 
I’ve encountered brief moments 
of turbulence, and I was unsure 
about the decisions I ought to 
make because the consequences 
were unforeseeable. Personally, 
I’ve 
had 
better 
experience 

jumping 
right 
into 
actions 

than second-guessing myself, 

because even though I may not 
have the most ideal patch of 
grass to land on, at least I can 
enjoy the ride on the way down.

Hard Landings: After exiting 

the aircraft, you experience 
a brief gust of air that blows 
your body parallel to and away 
from the aircraft, prior to 
the deployment of your main 
parachute. After your main 
parachute deploys, you inspect 
the canopy for any rips or 
tears and gain canopy control. 
During 
your 
descent, 
you 

maintain situational awareness 
of your position relative to your 
fellow jumpers to prevent any 
accidental collisions.

At 200 feet, you pull down 

and hold onto your risers in 
the opposite direction of your 
drift to ease your descent prior 
to landing on the ground. For 
my first jump, I hit the ground 
HARD. Contrary to executing 
a proper PLF on all five points 
of contact, I landed on the 
balls of my feet, glutes and 
upper back on a hard dirt road. 
Even though I acted on the 
training I received to the best 
of my ability, I still managed to 
eat dirt.

Likewise, at the University 

there’s going to be that one 
problem set, quiz or exam that 
you spent hours preparing for. 
You frequently attended office 
hours and study group sessions 
and 
reviewed 
every 
past 

assignment, but your best still 
wasn’t good enough to do well 
on that exam. This happened 
to me after receiving terrible 
marks for my first midterm 
in NERS 311. Nevertheless, I 
picked myself up, reflected 
on what went wrong, and 
readjusted my method of action 
which eventually improved my 
performance in NERS 311 and 
my PLFs in further jumps.

Pulling 
your 
Reserve: 

During my last jump, I pulled 
my reserve parachute when 

I was about 200 feet above 
the ground because my main 
parachute had some serious 
twists and I thought I was 
falling at a rate faster than 
my fellow jumpers. I was 
attempting to undo the twists 
in my parachute by trying to 
separate the risers while doing 
bicycle kicks in the air. Due to 
my limited depth perception, 
I believed myself to be falling 
at a faster rate than usual, 
so I panicked and pulled my 
reserve parachute to prepare 
for the worst. After I pulled 
my reserve, my main parachute 
untwisted and reflated so my 
reserve parachute flew up and 
wrapped around me during my 
descent to the ground.

The 
reserve 
parachute’s 

failure 
to 
inflate 
was 
an 

indication that I did not need 
it to land safely. By the time 
I landed, I was berated for 
using the reserve in a non-
life-threatening 
situation. 

However, I did what I was 
trained to do in pulling my 
reserve when I felt that my 
life was at risk. So, at the 
University, don’t be afraid to 
use the resources available to 
you to ask for help. This can be 
tied to almost anything at the 
University — be it academics, 
social life, mental health, etc. 
If you don’t understand what 
your professor went over in 
class, 
address 
and 
resolve 

the situation as soon as you 
can instead of putting it off 
until the last moment. Even if 
the situation doesn’t exhibit 
any present treachery at the 
moment, it is better to deploy 
your reserve parachute 200 
feet above ground than 70 
feet if and when your main 
parachute fails.

nuclear engineering and radiological 

sciences and an ROTC Cadet.

Lil Uzi Vert in a crowd
Lil Uzi Vert’s ‘Luv is 
Rage 2’ is the new emo

Lil Uzi Vert returns on his newest release and exposes his 
mastery of hip hop and emo despite the album’s weak links

Above all else, Lil Uzi Vert’s 

new album Luv Is Rage 2 is 
present. It is simultaneously 
the best indicator of where rap 
is today and a perfect harbinger 
of where it will be, for better or 
for worse.

It’s funny to think how 

Uzi’s skyrocket to fame largely 
came from a place of derision. 
His verse on Migos’s “Bad and 
Boujee” was the target of plenty 
of memes — particularly that 
ubiquitous, 
croaking 
verse-

opener, “yeah yeah yeah.” It’s 
comparable to how Young Thug 
blew 
up 
after 

the 
widespread 

confusion 
over 

what the hell he 
was saying on 
the Rich Gang 
hit 
“Lifestyle.” 

But 
many 

mistakenly took 
that 
emphasis 

on 
style 
as 

an 
omission 

of 
content. 

Sometimes 
it 
was 
true. 

Plenty of Young 
Thug’s 
lyrics 

are simply non 
sequiturs. Plenty 
of Uzi’s lyrics are 
pointless.

Plenty 
aren’t 

though, 
and 

what Uzi has done better than 
nearly 
any 
other 
up-and-

coming rapper now is marry 
that focus on an aesthetic style 
with lyrics and a delivery that 
are 
deceptively 
profound. 

It’s an approach that feels 
particularly fitting for the rap 
scene today, where personality 
and 
style 
seem 
constantly 

at the forefront. With the 
overabundance of Soundcloud 
rappers and the ease with which 
a flow can be co-opted, rappers 
who are going to truly make it 
need to separate themselves 
from the pack. A consuming, 
recognizable persona is one of 
the best ways to do that.

Uzi 
could 
have 
stopped 

there. His sing-song voice has 
a way with melody, and it’s 
often easy to remember the 
rhythm of his tracks because 
of how well he can simply 
ride a beat. It’s reminiscent 
to how Young Thug’s voice 
can function more like an 
instrument than spoken word. 
Uzi’s voice, though, actually 
blends with his production in a 
slightly different way, seeping 
into the bass lines and synths, 
whereas Thugger’s voice often 
stands on its own plane. He 
works particularly well with 
producers who fill rhythm 
into every gap and let Uzi slide 
along within the space between 
percussion.

Burgeoning producer Maaly 

Raw certainly has such an ear, 
and has managed to achieve 
turn up perfection more than 
once with Uzi; the A$AP Mob 
track “Runner,” for example, 
and 
“Money 

Longer,” 
from 

Uzi’s well received 
Lil Uzi Vert Vs. 
The 
World, 
are 

two of the most 
infectious 
tracks 

I’ve heard in years. Raw’s beat 
pattern has a strong influence 
here, and he lends a hand on 
track two, nine, 10, 13 and 15.

But his newest release, Luv 

Is Rage 2 (the follow-up to his 
debut mixtape Luv Is Rage), 

manages 
to 

solidify 
Uzi’s 

reach past just 
club 
anthems. 

Nowhere 
is 

this 
better 

exhibited than 
the 
last 
two 

tracks, 
“Dark 

Queen” 
and 

“XO 
TOUR 

Llif3.”

The 
latter, 

released 
as 

a 
single 
in 

March, became 
an 
enormous, 

unexpected 
hit, 
and 
is 

certainly 
one 

of Uzi’s best. 
All 
of 
those 

inherently 

messy thoughts he has tried to 
articulate before — listlessness, 
solitude, 
sadness 
 
— 
come 

to fruition in what equates 
to a shimmering scream for 
help, equal parts Future and 
Bright Eyes. It’s a direct and 
compelling expression of a 
rapper’s struggle 
with depression 
and 
substance 

abuse, 
tackling 

his 
mental 

state 
after 
his 

breakup 
with 

ex-girlfriend 
Brittany 
Byrd. 

His only friends 
are 
Xanax 
— 

“Please, Xanny, 
make 
it 
go 

away” 
— 
and 

dead presidents 
(money) — “All my friends are 
dead.” The track is unflaggingly 
honest and cuts right to the 
heart, Uzi’s voice breaking 
with exhaustion at the chorus 
(a hallmark of emo bands from 
the ’80s and on, which this 
track is reminiscent of).

The former, “Dark Queen,” 

deals with the complexity of his 
relationship with his mother 
over 
a 
brooding, 
spacious 

beat produced by Maaly Raw 
and Rex Kudo. He addresses 
her 
directly, 
talking 
about 

her concerns for him and his 
appreciation for her. It’s a 

clear stand out on the album, 
showcasing the same kind of 
straightforward honesty that 
he does on “XO TOUR Llif3.”

This is where Uzi truly 

excels. He has plenty of fun, 

bouncy, 
loud 

tracks, and these 
aren’t 
too 
far 

off 
from 
that 

formula. 
But 

instead of simply 
flexing over the 

beat and repeating the same 
clichés we’re so used to in the 
genre, Uzi turns that on its 
head.

We haven’t seen work quite 

like this since his debut, so 
it’s fitting that Luv Is Rage 2 
marks its follow up. Uzi’s last 
two releases, Lil Uzi Vert Vs. 
The World and The Perfect 
Luv Tape, while both well 
merited as party music, didn’t 
scratch too far below the 
shiny rhinestone surface, with 
perhaps the exception of “You 
Was Right.” But even on that 
track he sounds like he’s in a 
haze, attempting to make an 
apology but getting lost in his 
fame on the way.

Rather, the best precursor 

to this album is the final track 
from Luv is Rage, “Paradise,” a 
pop-inspired song that walks 
the line between optimism 
and sadness: “Paradise / It’s 
somewhere that I’ve never 
been before / I just wanna be 
there when I wake up.” Uzi 
wants better, but lets himself 
play in the limbo. That gray 
area felt lost in some of his later 
tracks, replaced with material 
obsessions, but it comes back 
in full force on this release, and 
the result is songwriting that is 
at once nuanced and controlled. 
On the addicting “X,” he asserts 

“Yeah my life’s 
a mess / But I’m 
also 
blessed.” 

“Neon 
Guts,” 

assisted 
by 

Pharrell, is both 
a celebration and 
the manifesto of 
an alien.

But what Uzi 

loses 
on 
this 

confessional 
is 

the succinctness 
that 
made 
his 

last two projects 

so approachable. The first four 
tracks and The Weeknd feature 
could all be cut and nothing 
notable would be lost. It’s the 
baggage that comes from Uzi 
wanting to push further but 
being unsure of where to cut 
back. There’s a danger that 
comes when your album starts 
off on such a low note — some 
may 
simply 
stop 
listening 

entirely.

Nonetheless, Lil Uzi Vert 

has accomplished what he set 
out to do here, and if this is any 
indication, his trajectory from 
here is starred.

ALBUM REVIEW

FINGERPRINT RELEASING

Channing Tatum in ‘Logan Lucky’
Soderbergh’s ‘Lucky’ is an 
Appalachian masterpiece

Director of ‘Ocean’s 11’ brings us a film founded in 
location and ingenuity with new movie ‘Logan Lucky’

There is absolutely no edge 

to “Logan Lucky,” and that 
might just be its strength. It’s 
a heist movie without a single 
gun: 
simple 
entertainment 

where the audience is asked 
to do nothing but engage 
with 
likable 
people 
doing 

interesting things. It’s sweet, 
soulful, energizing and, best 
of all, original. It’s almost 
singular in 2017.

It’s 
also 
fascinatingly 

apolitical, 
especially 

considering the first 15 minutes 
are nearly indistinguishable 
from a Trump campaign ad. 
A 
hardworking, 
handsome 

white guy (Channing Tatum, 
“Magic Mike”) loses his job at 
a coal mine. Of 
course, it’s not 
Jimmy Logan’s 
fault or even his 
boss’s — an HR 
employee twists 
Obamacare’s 
famous 
buzzword, 
“pre-existing 
condition,” 
against 
him 

after noticing a 
limp in his leg. 
It’s an excellent 
little 
summary 

of the modern 
American 
financial 
struggle, 
and 
even 
kale-

munching leftists like myself 
will be instantly pulled into 
having sympathy for this guy.

Rather than blaming any of 

the usual suspects for his crisis 
(the Democrats, immigrants, 
bureaucracy, brown people), 
Jimmy’s brother, a one-armed 
bartender 
played 
lovingly 

by 
Adam 
Driver 
(“Star 

Wars: The Force Awakens”), 
instead suspects that they’re 

suffering from a generations-
old family curse. The two 
have grisly injuries, and their 
folks are dead. The solution? 
Successfully rob the Charlotte 
Motor Speedway during the 
biggest NASCAR race of the 
year, 
thereby 

lifting 
the 

curse. Of course 
it’s 
that. 
Why 

wouldn’t 
it 
be 

that?

From 
there, 

it’s a rollicking 
two hours that 
feel like one, as 
we 
watch 
the 

brothers and a 
steadily growing 
crew 
of 
likable 
rednecks 

prepare 
for 
and 
execute 

the 
aforementioned 
heist. 

There are of course echoes of 

director Steven 
Soderbergh’s 
previous 
work 

on the “Ocean’s” 
franchise, 
but 

not 
as 
much 

as 
you 
would 

expect — there’s 
no cool tech, just 
entertaining 
ingenuity 
from 

the 
characters. 

There are weird 
little 
touches 

like 
a 
heist 

recruitment 
at 
an 
apple 

bobbing contest, 
a 
hand-off 

with a mysterious man in a 
full bear suit in the woods 
and an explosive made from 
gummy bears and a plastic 
bag. Joe Bang (Daniel Craig, 
“Spectre”), the bank robber 
broken out of prison by the 
Logan 
brothers 
to 
guide 

their heist, is a delightfully 
iconoclastic 
character 
that 

plays off of Craig’s James Bond 
persona — Bang is nearly the 
polar opposite of the cold, 

classy Bond, but the two are 
equally professional.

It cannot be overstated just 

how much fun each and every 
scene in this movie is. The 
southern mundanity of “Logan 
Lucky” is just as exciting 

as 
the 
sexy 

professionalism 
of 
“Ocean’s 

Eleven.”

As 
usual, 

Soderbergh’s 
muted 
camerawork 
perfectly 
services 
what 

he’s 
trying 
to 

accomplish. 
Soderbergh 

loves actors, and his simple, 
journeyman style makes you 
love them too. It’s the people 
that take focus, not flashy 
visuals or stunt set pieces. I 
remember one of the very first 
lessons I had in film school 
was 
about 
how 
directors 

effectively use movie stars, 
and my professor played scenes 
with George Clooney from 
Soderbergh’s “Out of Sight.” 
I could see that lesson thirty 
years from now being taught 
with this movie, with Tatum. 
There’s an intricate dance that 
Soderbergh does with celebrity 
persona, expectations, in-the-
moment acting presence and 
editing rhythm that makes 
his movies feel alive. More so 
than any other film this year, 
“Logan Lucky” feels like it has 
a pulse.

“Logan Lucky” isn’t doing 

very well at the box office. 
It’s not part of any shared 
universe, there’s no sex, no 
violence, no corporate tie-ins, 
no hundred-million-dollar ad 
campaign. It’s just a good old-
fashioned movie, the kind that 
are not long for this world. 
This will probably be one of 
the last ones, so enjoy it now, 
in theaters, while you still can.

NETFLIX

Stars of Netflix’s ‘Wet Hot American Summer’ revival
Ian Harris: The problem 
with neverending shows
How the resounding influence of ‘Sherlock Holmes’ and 
‘Wet Hot American Summer’ turns to beating a dead horse

“Let’s all promise that in ten 

years from today, we’ll meet 
again, and we’ll see what kind 
of 
people 
we’ve 
blossomed 

into.” These words, spoken by 
Bradley Cooper in the original 
“Wet Hot American Summer,” 
form the basis for the second 
season of the Netflix revival 
that began two years ago with 
“First Day of Camp.” “Wet Hot 
American Summer” is just the 
latest franchise to enter into 
a state of what I like to call 
“Perpetual Ending Purgatory.” 
Other offenders of this include 
“Arrested Development” and 
the 
BBC 
series 
“Sherlock.” 

In essence, these are series 
that never truly end, but also 
do not continue in any kind 
of 
regular 
fashion. 
There 

won’t be another season of 
“Sherlock”... 
until 
there 
is. 

“Arrested Development” fans 
have spent the better part of a 
decade now waiting on a Season 

5 to wrap up story threads left 
over from the long gestating 
Netflix-sponsored Season 4. All 
this after the show originally 
concluded in a pretty satisfying 
way back in 2005.

This 
“Perpetual 
Ending 

Purgatory” 
is 
especially 

prevalent 
among 
Netflix 

revivals 
and 
other 
kinds 

of 
sporadically-appearing 

television series that don’t air 
every year in the way most 
series do. And while this is 
potentially cause for rejoice 
for the various fans of these 
shows, it also makes it harder 
for audiences to interpret what 
it is they are watching. Take 
“Wet Hot American Summer: 
Ten Years Later.” At surface 
level, it would seem like this is 
the natural place to conclude 
the “Wet Hot” franchise once 
and for all. They have now gone 
back in time with “First Day of 
Camp” and made it all the way to 
the point originally mentioned 
in the feature film. One would 
think there isn’t much more 
that can be mined out of these 
characters and storylines at 
this point. But without any 
kind of confirmation one way 
or the other that this is really 
the grand finale for the Camp 
Firewood gang, the climax of 
the miniseries loses much of its 
potential impact.

“Sherlock” Series 4 is another 

example of why it’s important 
for an audience to know if they 

are 
watching 

the conclusion 
to a story or 
merely another 
chapter. 
That 

whole 
series 

focused a lot on 
the impact that 
Sherlock 
and 

John Watson’s 
adventures 
had had on the 
people around 
them 
and 
it 

really tried to 
bring the series 
full 
circle 

in a number 
of 
ways. 
It 

ended 
in 
a 

way that could 
be viewed as 
an 
ending, 

but 
could 

also 
easily 

be 
continued 

on from any 
number 
of 

years 
from 

now. 
To 
an 

extent 
that 

was 
probably 

the 
point. 

But should it 
have 
been? 

We live in a 
culture 
that 

is 
obsessed 

with 
dusting 

off old things 
and 
bringing 

them back to 
go 
through 

the 
same 

motions 
all 

over again and 
this 
inability 

to let anything 
end is slowly 
but 
surely 

degrading 
the 
overall 

quality of long 
form western 
storytelling.

Even 
the 

creators 
of 

these 
shows 

don’t 
have

Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day

CONCERT REVIEW

All hail Green Day: on the 
punk band’s lasting legacy

Green Day’s recent concert at Darien Lake in Buffalo is a 
testament to what makes the band a uniting, everlasting force

When you mix a couple rock 

stars in their 40s with copious 
amounts 
of 
pyrotechnics, 

a few killer sax solos, the 
energy of DIY punks and a 
groundbreaking catalogue of 
music, you get the greatest 
band in the world playing 
music today. But before I dive 
into the details of Green Day’s 
set at Darien Lake, NY, we’re 
going to rewind to March of 
this year to the third Green 
Day show I had ever attended.

It’s the evening of Mar. 27, 

a Monday, and I’m making my 
way into Joe Louis Arena to 
wait for my friend to arrive 
while enjoying one of punk 
rock’s most important bands, 
Against Me!, open the show. 
After their set, my friend and 
I make our way into the crowd 
to find her (now our) friend, an 
incredibly special fan from the 
U.K. she had met a few years 
ago in Europe at a Green Day 
show.

This special fan is Fran 

Green — yes, her last name 
is literally Green — and her 
dedication to Green Day is 
on a newsworthy level (she’s 
actually been interviewed by 
the local news in Iowa). Fast 
forward to the morning of Aug. 
26 to find me on my way to 
Darien Lake (just past Buffalo) 
with my friend and none other 
than Fran Green herself after 
spending four weeks in the 
United States following Green 

Day’s tour. That evening, I saw 
Green Day for my fourth time; 
for Fran, it was her 57th show.

Ms. Green’s dedication is 

a small component of what 
has made and kept Green Day 
so important over the years. 
Green Day is a band that unites 
people 
across 
continents, 

forms friendships and shapes 
adolescent identities. She’s not 
alone in her adoration, as Green 
Day continues to play stadiums 
and arenas to hundreds of 
thousands of fans; rising from 
modest roots in the East Bay 
punk scene, the band found 
quick success in cementing 
themselves in the annals of 
punk rock’s history. Having 
been formed over 30 years ago, 
the band hasn’t missed a beat 
in performance, performing 
with youthful energy entirely 
unique to Green Day within 
the arena rock scene.

Green Day’s performances 

have turned them into legend, 
striking awe into the crowd 
while retaining the down-to-
earth relatability that is the 
basis of punk music. During 
“St. Jimmy,” an excited fan 
screamed from behind me, “I 
love you, St. Jimmy!” reflecting 
Armstrong’s 
mythological 

status as a musician, blurring 
the line between fictional and 
real hero. When Armstrong 
looks into the eyes of his fans, 
the 
connection 
is 
electric. 

Whether 
he’s 
playing 
to 

thousands — which I witnessed 
last fall at the Fillmore Detroit 
— or tens of thousands, the 
frontman exudes an aura of 
understanding, comfort and 
passion. After all these years, 
you just know he still gets it.

And this is Green Day’s real 

magic. They’re all about having 
fun 
(i.e. 
their 
outlandish 

attire during “King for a Day,” 
which included tutus, pirate 
hats and funky sunglasses), 
but they also don’t shy away 
from real life issues; Billie 
Joe isn’t afraid to say “This is 
for all the weirdos out there” 
or just a straight up “Fuck 
Trump.” I mentioned this in 
the past in my review of 2016’s 
comeback record Revolution 
Radio, but Green Day has a 
knack for mixing important 
personal and political notions 
into their music — something 

that 
translates 
into 
their 

performance.

As a now “seasoned” veteran 

of Green Day performances, 
my only real qualm with their 
set is the elaborately drawn 
out “King for a Day.” The 
song itself is fun and all, but 
the approximately 20-minute 
charade with inclusions of 
cover snippets from “Shout,” 

“Hey, Jude” and other rock 
classics 
starts 
to 
drag 
in 

comparison to their own music. 
They could easily fit four songs 
in that time frame, even treat 
the longtime fans to oldies like 
“One of My Lies” or “One for 
the Razorbacks” to supplement 
the usual staple “2,000 Light 
Years Away.”

Nonetheless, it’s a treat in 

itself to still have Green Day 
performing at the top of their 
game. With sets including 
classics 
from 
the 
’90s 
to 

modern bangers off their most 
recent record, the band shows 
no signs of slowing in the 
near future. Having already 
garnered multiple generations 
of fans passed along from 
parent to child and friend to 
friend, Green Day is a band built 
upon emotional connection — a

In new role, Jay Harbaugh doesn’t run to form

Tyrone Wheatley may have 

left Michigan’s coaching staff 
for the Jacksonville Jaguars, 
but very little has changed. 

Now under the tutelage of 

Jay 
Harbaugh, 
Michigan’s 

running backs have been quick 
to point out how interactive 
their new position coach is. 
Stereotypes may suggest an 
authoritarian 
relationship 

between a coach and a player. 
Harbaugh 
doesn’t 
fit 
that 

stereotype.

“Because Coach Jay has 

never 
played 
the 
position, 

sometimes 
we 
see 
things 

that he may not see,” said 
sophomore 
Karan 
Higdon. 

“And sometimes it’s vice versa, 
which is really good because 
we’re able to converse about 
it and try and get each other 
to see and get to a mutual 

understanding. And it’s been 
great because it’s enabled us to 
reach our full potential.”

Added Harbaugh: “For me, 

they’re an extension of me on 
the field. So it’s invaluable 
to hear what they’re seeing 
and what they feel, and then 
try to use that to either make 
corrections 
or 
adjustments 

over the course of a practice 
(or) game. Good information 
from veteran guys that you can 
trust is really really crucial.”

The one thing that hasn’t 

changed, though, is that the 
Wolverines are sharing the 
responsibilities of the backfield 
once again. Granted, Chris 
Evans 
was 
the 
undisputed 

starter against then-No. 17 
Florida, 
as 
the 
sophomore 

notched 22 carries to fifth-
year senior Ty Isaac’s 11.

But 
when 
Harbaugh 

addressed 
the 
media 

Wednesday 
afternoon, 
he 

made it clear that the group 
will continue sharing carries, 
while also adding that he 
wants the trio — Evans, Isaac 
and Higdon — to virtually 
become interchangeable as the 
season progresses.

“I think it’s a great thing,” 

Harbaugh said. “They’re all 
different. They have unique 
skillsets. I think that makes it 
a little bit hard on the defense, 
when you’re getting different 
guys thrown at you and they 
have 
different 
styles 
and 

different types of moves and 
ways of hitting certain runs.

“It is what it is. They’re not 

the same so you can’t treat 
them all the same. Ideally, if 
they all have the same amount 
of competency then they are 
interchangeable, and they’re 
just gonna hit certain runs in 
their own way.”

Against the Gators, each 

back’s strengths were certainly 
on display. Isaac turned 11 
carries into 114 yards and 
functioned 
as 
an 
effective 

— if unconventional — third-
and-long weapon. Evans took 
the bulk of the carries for 78 
yards and came just shy of a 
touchdown after tripping near 
the end zone on the opening 
drive.

And finally Higdon, though 

limited to just seven carries, 
managed to punch in the 
Wolverines’ 
lone 
rushing 

touchdown on two consecutive 
carries from Florida’s 10-yard 
line. 
Between 
the 
three, 

Michigan managed to rack up 
221 yards on the ground.

Though it may only be one 

game, 
Michigan’s 
running 

game is shaping up to look 
eerily similar to last year’s 
combination 
of 
Evans, 

Higdon and De’Veon Smith. 
Realistically, 
it’s 
not 
very 

surprising.

The denomination as the 

starting back still undoubtedly 
matters, but each has been 

quick to give the company line: 
that the number of carries 
they 
receive 
is 
irrelevant. 

But — after all — there is still 
a majority of carries to be 
earned, and the trio is well 
aware of that.

“They’re 
certainly 

competitive,” Harbaugh said. 
“Every running back is gonna 
want the ball. They’ve done 
a great job being unselfish 
as a group — rooting for 
each other’s success and still 
taking advantage of their own 
opportunities. I expect them to 
want the ball more.

“As a coach, you’re just gonna 

assume that everyone’s gonna 
have a healthy discontent with 
their role, because they think 
that they’re ‘the guy’. And if 
you’re recruiting the right 
guys that’s gonna be the case. 
They’re done a really good job 
balancing that — that kind of 
natural selfish instinct as a 
back — with. ‘Hey I’m a team 
guy, this is a team within a 
team.’ ”

Secondary adapting to new defensive scheme

Of all the position groups 

Michigan had to rebuild on 
the defensive side of the ball, 
the secondary was expected to 
have the most pieces to replace. 

When it came to the defensive 

backfield — especially at safety 
— the picture was blurry, to say 
the least. The two new starters 
— junior Tyree Kinnel and 
sophomore Josh Metellus — had 
only one career start between 
them.

With the way 

they 
played 

Saturday 
in 

Michigan’s 
season-opening 
victory 
over 

Florida, 
though, 
you 

wouldn’t 
have 

noticed 
their 

inexperience.

The 
safety 

duo 
tallied 

nine 
tackles 

in 
their 
first 

career 
starts, 

including 
1.5 

tackles for loss 
by Kinnel and 
a forced fumble 
by Metellus.

The 
two 

played the vast 
majority of the 
game, as defensive coordinator 
Don Brown opted for a tight 
rotation within the secondary. 
Working in tandem for such 
long 
stretches, 
Kinnel 
and 

Metellus had the opportunity 
to continue growing as a joint 
unit. Kinnel has spoken highly 
of his new position partner 
before. And Monday, he did so 
once again.

“(Metellus) did everything 

well. He was talking to me all 

the time, making checks as I 
was making checks,” Kinnel 
said. “He covered a lot more 
than me in that game, just 
because of (the Gators’) offense, 
and I felt like he covered really 
well.”

While 
two 
safeties 
is 

typically the norm, Brown 
and his staff utilized a 3-3-5 
scheme, which they debuted 
against Florida with positive 
results. The shift gifted Kinnel 
and Metellus with even more 
help manning the secondary 

in 
sophomore 

defensive 
back 

Khaleke Hudson.

Between 

the free safety, 
strong safety and 
VIPER 
— 
the 

hybrid 
position 

Hudson 
started 

at — the three 
defensive 
backs 

shuffled through 
a 
variety 
of 

responsibilities. 
Kinnel 
spent 

most 
of 
his 

time as the free 
safety, 
while 

Metellus 
and 

Hudson 
moved 

back and forth 
between 
strong 

safety and VIPER 
pretty 
evenly 

in 
different 

formations.

The ability to switch between 

Hudson 
and 
Metellus 
has 

added an extra dimension to 
an already-complex defensive 
scheme. So far, the transition 
has been seamless for the 
trio of safeties. According to 
defensive backs coach Brian 
Smith, the added wrinkle has 
been a “luxury.”

“That versatility, being able 

to move in different places, 

helps out the defense as a core 
— getting guys lined up and 
giving the offense different 
looks,” Smith said.

Kinnel described the process 

of switching as situational, 
where 
the 
defense 
has 
to 

read the offense and react 
quickly. Since the shifts are not 
necessarily incumbent upon a 
run or pass play, the practice 
keeps all three on their toes.

“As a (defensive back), you 

always have to think that the 
ball is coming your way every 
snap,” Smith said. “That’s the 
way you have to prepare for 
it. … You can’t look at it any 
differently or you won’t have as 

much success.”

While the technical aspects 

are still a work in progress, the 
foundation seems firmly built. 
Throughout 
Michigan’s 
fall 

camp, the theme for its budding 
defense was “flying to the ball,” 
as Kinnel called it.

“Coach Brown and (defensive 

line coach) Mattison told us, 
‘Here at Michigan, we run to 
the ball,’ ” Kinnel said. “And we 
took that in, we took it personal, 
and I think we did a pretty good 
job on Saturday.

“I 
thought 
our 

communication was on point. 
There are some things that we 
have to clean up… (but) when 

we play fast and hard, it covers 
up a lot.”

While the secondary looked 

to be on the same page Saturday, 
Smith admitted that it took a 
long time for the unit to find 
its footing. It wasn’t until the 
final week of fall camp that it 
all began to come together.

“That last week, they did 

a great job communicating,” 
Smith said. “That’s something 
we had been stressing all camp, 
all the way back to the spring, 
being different guys back in 
the secondary, not having been 
used to working together.

“And you could it see that 

last week. Guys were calling 

out, making all the checks, 
not just the safeties, the whole 
secondary, the linebackers, they 
all were working together.”

Though growing pains are 

bound to reveal themselves 
as 
the 
season 
progresses, 

whenever those troubles arise, 
Kinnel, Metellus, Hudson and 
the rest of the defense will be 
able to look back at Saturday 
and see what they are capable 
of together.

“It definitely sets the tone,” 

Kinnel said. “We got that out 
on film that everyone can see 
that we play fast and play hard. 
We just have to keep it up, keep 
getting after it.”

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Junior safety Tyree Kinnel earned the first start of his career this past weekend when Michigan faced off against the Gators in the AdvoCare Classic.

BETELHEM ASHAME

Managing Sports Editor

Despite sharing one start between the two of them, safeties Josh Metellus and Tyree Kinnel showcased their potential as 

a duo against then-No. 17 Florida on Saturday, combining for nine tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and a forced fumble.

“As a (defensive 

back), you 

always have to 
think that the 
ball is coming 
your way every 
snap. That’s the 
Way you have 
to prepare for 

it.”
