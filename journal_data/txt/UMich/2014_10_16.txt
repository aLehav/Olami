University Regent Denise
Ilitch (D) told a local CBS tele-
vision program Sunday that the
regents plan to discuss the Ath-
letic Department at Thursday's
monthly meeting.
Ilitch appeared on Michigan
Matters Sunday morning and
said she has received extensive
feedback regarding sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris' con-
cussion sustained against Min-
nesota Sept. 27, how his injury
was handled by the football team
and the status of the Athletic
Department as a whole.
"The system failed that day
and there are a lot of issues we

need to review now," Ilitch told
Michigan Matters.
She said the regents will be
discussing athletics Thursday
and she expects many concerned
citizens to speak out during the
meeting's public commentary
portion. The official agenda,
released Monday, does not cur-
rently include any discussion
of athletics. However, it is not
uncommon for supplemental
agendas to be presented during
meetings at the last minute. The
meetings of the Board of Regents
are regularly scheduled, public
gatherings that occur monthly
and the dates are typically set
more than one year in advance.
The regents meet once per year
at the University of Michigan's
Flint campus, usuallyin October.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said he does not
expect any formal discussion of
athletics to occur at Thursday's
meeting and said he has no indi-
cation there would be any kind of
supplemental agenda. However,

Presidential stop

President Barack Obama is
scheduled to visit Michigan in
the last full week of the cam-

paign season later this month.
Following his wife, First Lady
Michelle Obama, and Hillary
Clinton, former secretary of
state, Obama will promote Dem-
ocratic hopefuls.
Obama will also campaign for
gubernatorial candidates that
week in Wisconsin, Pennsylva-
nia and Maine, a White House
official told the Associated Press
Wednesday morning.

Polls show that incumbent
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) is lead-
ing his Democratic challenger
Mark Schauer by an average of
3.5 points. Democrats have an
edge in the U.S. Senate race,
where U.S. Rep. Gary Peters (D-
Detroit) leads Michigan Secre-
tary of State Terri Lynn Land by
nine points.
Peters is the only senato-
rial candidate Obama will cam-

paign for, and Peters is also
the only Senate nominee that
has requested an appearance
with the president. Meanwhile,
Michelle Obama, former Pres.
Bill Clinton and other Demo-
cratic figures have campaigned
for a range of candidates across
the nation for November's mid-
term election.

RESEARCH
UHS survey
looks at student
health, wellness

Stress, anxiety
identified as major
academicimpediments
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
Wednesday morning, Univer-
sity Health Service released a
summary of results of its Nation-
al College Health Assessment - a
survey 7,000 undergraduate and
5,000 graduate and professional
students designed to shed light
on the current state of student
health and provide the Universi-
ty with a resource for addressing
campus needs.
The University has previously
conducted the survey, based
on recommendations from the
American College Health Asso-
ciation, in 2006 and 2010. The
2014 survey was conducted in
February.
The survey sought to gather
data on a wide array of topics,
including students' impediments
to academic performance, vio-
lence on campus, substance use

and abuse, sexual health, nutri-
tion and students' medical his-
tory. The results of each survey
item were compared against
2006 and 2010 responses, as well
as Healthy Campus 2020 goals -
a 10-year national campus health
objectives set forth by the ACHA
designed in parallel with the
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Service's Healthy People
2020 initiative.
The University has already
met the Healthy Campus 2020
goals in several key areas, but
acknowledged other areas where
they have not yet achieved those
goals. UHS Health Educator
Carol Tucker said while the Uni-
versity takes note of the Healthy
Campus 2020 goals in the survey,
it has independent and some-
times more ambitious goals in
some specific areas, such as alco-
hol abuse.
For instance, only 10 percent
of undergraduate respondents
indicated they had smoked a
cigarette in the last month at
the time of the survey - down
from 16 percent in 2006 and 12

"Hail to the Victors" is more
than just a fight song - it's often
how people are first introduced

to the University. But how often
it is played, at what tempo and
how it is arranged with other
songs are all decisions made by
a variety of people. The coor-
dination of music at University
sporting events is a complicated
affair.
At a mixed lecture and open-
table discussion hosted by the
School of Music, Theatre, and

than 100 University students
and Ann Arbor residents inter-
acted with a panel well-versed

ABRUPT WAKE-UP
An alarming morning

COSTUME COUTURE

LSA freshman Mihir
Patil was lathering him-
self with soap around
11:30 a.m. Wednesday
when a piercing noise
interrupted his sudsy
shower sanctuary in
one of Alice Lloyd Hall's
third floor bathrooms.
"I was in the shower,
and there's this horri-
ble sound, and then the
lights start flickering,"
he said.
A voice over the inter-
com blared out seconds
later, announcing that
the pandemonium was
a result of the fire alarm
being set off.
"I think there's a fire,

I'm scared for my life, I
dry myself off, calmly
put my clothes on and
limp downstairs because
I have a sprained ankle,"
Patil said.
He sprained the ankle
over the long weekend
while playing basketball.
After crossing over a
friend - or "breakinghis
ankles," so to speak - he
sped too quickly in the
opposite direction and
"broke" his own.
Once he walked out-
side to avoid the poten-
tially impending fire,
Patil sat down with a
few fellow Lloyd resi-
dents. He said they were

complaining about the
alarm, so he joined in.
A few minutes later,
the incessant beeping
subsided and he went
back inside to finish his
shower. He noted, how-
ever, that the alarm's
flashing lights did not
stop.
"I go back up to the
shower and undress
again," Patil said. "I
start glistening and then
the alarm goes off again.
I punched the wall ...
well, I palmed it."

507 facilities voluntarily

but for the first time, HEI also

The survey brings to light gaps
in hospital policy language that
refer only to sexual orientation
without addressing gender iden-
tities. To achieve recognition for
the first component of the survey,
facilities must include the terms
"sexual orientation" and "gender

patients' bill of rights, which must
also be accessible to patients in at
least two different forms.
Issues within non-discrimi-

survey, most often affect trans-
gender and gender non-conform-
ing individuals. While 97 percent
of HEI survey respondents have
a fully inclusive LGBT patient
non-discrimination policy, of
those facilities that chose not
to respond, only 51 percent had
acceptable non-discrimination
policies.

dents had equal visitation
policies, while 84 percent of
non-respondents had similar

96 percent of responding facil-

More than 86 percent of hos-

Governor skirts gay
marriage and pay
equality concerns
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily NewsEditor
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
discussed job growth, the slash
and later uptick of state fund-
ing for higher education, sexual
assault on college campuses and
views on same-sex marriage in a
conference call Wednesday.
Student journalists from the
University of Michigan, Michi-
gan State University, Central
Michigan University and Saginaw
Valley State University were on
the call. Throughout the Snyder
campaign, outreach efforts to
the public have increased. While
Republican Senate hopeful Terri
Lynn Land has avoided public
speeches and interviews with the
press, Snyder participated in a
town hall debate earlierthis week.
He and Land previously denied
requests for debate.
At the beginning of the call,
Snyder addressed economic
growth in Michigan, saying that
under his administration, the
state added around 300,000 pri-
vate sector jobs. He said college
students were key in ensuringthe
state continues to grow.
"You're our future," Snyder
said. "I want to make sure that we
can make sure we can make col-
lege and higher ed more afford-
able for people because we want
to encourage people to get the
skills, the training, the resources
to be successful and have a great
career in our state. We have lots
of exciting job opportunities in
Michigan and one of the keys is to
make sure you have the rightoskills
to fill those."
Questions focused on state
appropriations to higher educa-
tion. In 2011, Snyder cut 15 percent
of funding to public higher educa-
tion institutions. Gradual increas-
es in funding have followed the
initial cut: 3.1 percent increase in

2012; 2.2 percent in 2013; and 6.1
percent in2014.
Snyder said increases to the
higher education budget link to
the overall growth of Michigan's
economy.
"I think you'll find that the uni-
versity leaders over this last bud-
get were fairly pleased on where
we were heading," Snyder said.
"I actually sent the message that
as the recovery of our economy
keeps up, I hope to restore what
we had in place and actually add
more revenue to the universities.
So we're trying to be proactive
about that."
He said the initial cut to higher
educationwas difficult, butneces-
sary to balance the state budget.
"When I took office, I faced
a $1.5 billion budget deficit, so
we did have to make a cut to the
higher ed. budgetthat first year in
order to balance the budgetwhich
was difficult," Snyder said.
He added that he was interested
in developing a collaborative pro-
cess through which universities
and the government could work
together on managing the institu-
tions' budgets. Universities could
mimic municipalities' economiz-
ing IT systems, enterprise plat-
forms and contract negotiations
for lower costs of goods services.
When budget cuts began in
2011, The Michigan Daily report-
ed the University would reduce
costs by $100 million by 2012
and another $120 million by 2017.
Former University Provost Philip
Hanlon,--now president of Dart-
mouth College, saidthe University
combined IT units to save $7 mil-
lion, as Snyder suggested.
Former University President
Mary Sue Coleman testified in
2011 State Senate and House
Appropriations Subcommittees
on Higher Education in Lansing
that, while cutting coasts, the Uni-
versity was dedicated to ensure
tuition continued to be affordable.
University undergraduate
tuition from the academic years
2011-2012 to 2014-2015 differs by
$718 for Michigan residents, and
$1,995 for non-residents.

Snyder said in the conference
call that he wanted to place more I
emphasis on need-based tuition.
Current high school students
could also consider dual-enroll-
ment, and earn college credits
while in school. This could save a
year or greater of college tuition.
The governor avoided direct
answers on queries concerning
pay equity and same-sex mar-
riage. Asked if he was planning
to support legislation to address
Michigan's wage gap, in which
women earn 74 cents for every
dollar men earn, Snyder said his
administration "work(s) hard"
with all sectors of industry to
ensure payequity.
"That's where I think the law is
prettyclearpeople shouldalready
get the same pay so we want to
work on making sure we achieve
that," Snyder said.
Democrats have criticized his
lack of action on this issue. Sen.
Debbie Stabenow (D) most recent-
lyaddressed this in aWest Michi-
gan campaign stop this month.
"You can stand up and say, 'I
support equal pay,' but if you're
not willing to put teeth into the
law and enforce it, it doesn't
count,"Stabenow said.
Snyder also did not articulate
a stance on same-sex marriage. A
March 2014 ruling by the district
court deemed same-sex mar-
riage legal in Michigan, though
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette (R) asked for an emer-
gencystayonthisthe nextday and
brought itthe courtof appeals.
Democrats have panned the
Republican response to same-
sex marriage, and Snyder has
not taken a definitive stance on
the issue. He said any legislative
action to change the 2004 consti-
tutional amendment banning gay
marriage would come too late, as
the courts are likely to soon pro-
duce a decision on gay marriage.
"I'm waiting for the court deci-
sion,"he said.
However, Snyder said he is
"encouraging action" on the
Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act,

New Michigan law helps
sexual assault investigators

Legislation calls for
tracking, forensic
testing
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In a follow-up to summer leg-
islation establishing rules for the
submission and collection of sex-
ual assault kit evidence, Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder signed into
law Tuesday a bill which calls for
the creation of a kit tracking and
reporting commission in order to
"develop guidelines and a plan to
implement a uniform statewide
system to track the location, lab
submission status, completion of
forensic testing, and storage of
sexual assault evidence kits."
Sexual assault evidence col-
lection kits - commonly referred
to as rape kits - are forensic
evidence collection kits used by
trained practitioners to find any
DNA that may have been left by a
suspect of rape. The new law, now
Public Act 318 of 2014, mandates
that the commission not only
implement a system of tracking
rape kits but also that it develop
an electronic database for victims
or their designees to track the sta-
tus of their test results, if they so
choose.
Further, Public Act 318 asks
that the commission "recommend
sources of public and private
funding to implement the plans
developed under this subsection."
This is in addition to $25,000 of
appropriated funding that will be
provided for the state's Depart-
ment of Human Services on an
annual basis.
"Too many victims have been
waiting too long for justice they
deserve," Snyder said in a release.
"By ensuring faster testing and
more organized record-keeping
we can improve public safety and
help put the minds of assault vic-
tims at ease."

Pasquale said his job as band

director is more than just control-
ling the music: It is about control-
ling the psychology of the crowd.
"We support the athletes by
keeping the audience engaged,"
Pasquale said. "Do they really
care if I play 'Take On Me'? Not
really. What they do care about is
the audience cheering them on."
Kinesiology senior Joe Ker-
ridge, who plays on the football
team, agreed with Pasquale.
"When you get out onto the
field, the canned music and the
band is great for us," Kerridge
said. "But once the game starts,
I am pretty sure I can speak for

That act provided for the estab-

discovery in 2009 of more than
11,000 untested rape kits in a

age facility.

tor of the Michigan Domestic and

a powerful message to sexual
assault victims in Michigan that
our state is committed to making
justice for victims a priority."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said in an interview he
supports Public Act 318, calling
it a step in the right direction,
but added that he hopes the act of
establishing a committee to over-
see rape kit collection processes is
not a substitute for action.
"The commission will be effec-
tive if one of its responsibilities is
to encourage state lawmakers and
future governors to actually put
the resources into filling some of
the holes at the local level," Irwin
said.
He added that in many Michi-
gan localities, rape kits might go
unattended because there is more
work than there are resources to
do that work.
"Itis certainly more effective to
address local financial needs with
a small amountof state resources,"
Irwin said. "That is more direct
and effective in accomplishing
the goal than simply monitoring
the deficiencies at a local level and
highlightingthem."
Irwin also credited Wayne
County prosecutor Kym Worthy
for having lobbied the state gov-
ernment for years to make this
change.
Holly Rider-Milkovich, direc-
tor of the University's Sexual
Assault Prevention and Aware-

ness Center, said one of Public Act
318's biggest points of success will
be the development of a tracking
system for survivors.
"The tracking of the kit is
another, I think, really important
component because it ensures
that, to the greatest extent pos-
sible, survivors understand where
that forensic information is in
the system, and that that forensic
information does notget lost," she
said. "So it's not only about track-
ing it, but also about keeping sur-
vivors informed."
Rider-Milkovich also high-
lighted Public Act 320, which
was also signed into law Tues-
day and requires that health care
personnel responsible for exam-
ining or treating rape survivors
inform patients of the availabil-
ity of forensic examination kits
and their subsequent right to use
them.
She said the bills collectively
also give sexual assault survivors
a one-year grace period to decide
whether or not they want their
forensic results to move forward
to a law enforcement proceeding.
"All of these bills together
really are about greater account-
ability in the system to ensure
that this evidence is moving for-
ward in a timely fashion, that it
is being preserved appropriately,
and that survivors have infor-
mation about what happens to
the evidence that is being col-
lected from their bodies," Rider-.
Milkovich said.
Public Act 321 was signed into
law Tuesday as well, and requires
that individuals charged with
breakinglocal ordinances prohib-
iting prostitution, among other
penal code violations, be tested
for sexuallytransmitted diseases.
"Examination or test results
that indicate the presence of
venereal disease, hepatitis B
infection, hepatitis C infection,
HIV infection, or acquired immu-
nodeficiency syndrome must be
reported to the defendant," the
bill reads.

SURVEY
From Page 1A
percent in 2010. In this area, the
University has already surpassed
the Healthy Campus 2020 goal of
14.4 percent.
When asked about contracep-
tion, almost 87 percent of under-
graduates said they used any
method during their last vaginal
intercourse, while the Healthy
Campus 2020 goal is only 62.3
percent.
However, the University has
not yet met goals in reducing aca-
demic impairments from stress
and anxiety, binge drinking, hoo-
kah and marijuana use, increasing
the use of bike helmets and other
areas.
Campus sexual health
Sexual wellness and safety also
registered as an area of concern,
with the prevalence of students
who were sexually touched against
their will, sexually penetrated
without consent or in a sexually
abusive relationship all register-
ing higher than target levels. This
follows a July report by the Wash-
ington Post, based on data from
the U.S. Department of Education,
which found the University ranked
second nationally in reported sex-
ual assaults on college campuses
between 2010 and 2012.
Responses from two of these
groups - students who report-
ed being sexually penetrated
against their will and students
who reported being in a sexually
abusive relationship in the last 12
months -rose from 0.6 percent
to 1.6 percent from 2010 to 2014.
While Tucker said the small num-
ber of respondents in these cate-
gories - 1.6 percent correlating to
about 80 responses - necessitates

the use of other data sources, she
affirmed the University's commit-
mentto addressing the issue.
"The University is doing a tre-
mendous amount around sexual
misconduct," Tucker said. "We're
sharing this data with our part-
ners across campus and there will
be conversations I'm sure, and
there's also other opportunities
to triangulate (these results) using
other data sources."
This commitment, however,
has faced criticism from both stu-
dents and faculty. The University
is currently under investigation
by the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion's Office for Civil Rights for its
handling of sexual assault allega-
tions on campus.
Academic impediments
Tucker said one particular area
of interest for UHS was evaluat-
ing impediments to students' aca-
demic performance. After testing
30 different factors - including
elements such as work, death of a
family member, finances and alco-
hol abuse - the survey found that
students were most profoundly
influencedby stress and anxiety.
Students were asked whether
each of the test factors had con-
tributed to receiving a lower grade
or failing to complete an assign-
ment or class. Among undergrad-
uates, 31 percent reported stress
and 22 percent reported anxiety
as a contributing factor in such
decreases in performance.
The results fall in line with
national averages -inthe ACHA's
2013 nationally compiled results
of about 33,000 students, 27.9
percent reported stress and 19.7
percent reported anxiety as an
academic impediment.
The University offers several
campus resources, such as Coun-
seling and Psychological Services,

to help students combat these
issues and increasetheir academic
performance.
"College is a pressured environ-
ment," Tucker said. "There's high
expectations of performance and
accomplishment. Students often
enjoy that, but it comes with the
downside of feeling the stresses
associated with it."
AlcoholabuseinGreek Life
In light of efforts by the Uni-
versity's Greek system to combat
alcohol abuse, the surveyincluded
analysis of alcohol consequences
and protection strategies among
members and non-members of
such organizations.
The survey found significantly
higher rates of almost all unde-
sirable consequences of drinking
among fraternity and sorority
members versus non-Greek stu-
dents - injury, loss of memory,
unprotected sex, non-consensual
sex and trouble with law enforce-
ment.
Additionally, non-Greek stu-
dents were found significantly
more likely to employ protective
strategies regarding alcohol con-
sumption, such as tracking num-
ber of drinks, alternating alcoholic
and non-alcoholic beverages and
avoiding drinking games.
Tucker said UHS continues to
work with the Greek system to
address these harmful drinking
habits through offering services
such as sober monitor training
and "Stay inthe Blue" educational
materials.

that Obama's visit benefits the
candidates differently. Peters'
lead in the polls could buffer
negative pushback for appearing
with the unpopular Commander
in Chief, and the two politicians
support similar issues, including
the bailout of General Motors and
Chrysler.
Peters made a point to boost
Obama last Friday as he discussed
the auto bailout - a decision some
Michigan Republicans did not
support.
"Thank god President Obama
was there," Peters said on Friday.
Meanwhile, a visit from the
President could boost voter turn-
out for Schauer's campaign. Dem-

ocratic voter turnout for midterm
elections is often lower than in a
presidential election, so encour-
agement from Obama to get to the
polls could bolster Schauer's posi-
tion in the gubernatorial race.
"For Schauer, (Obama is) prob-
ably going to spend his time talk-
ing about turnout," Traugott said
last week. "In a tight race, that's
what each candidate is interested
in.
The White House also
announced today that the presi-
dent would postpone campaign
stops scheduled for this afternoon
to hold meetings with Cabinet
members about the government's
response to the Ebola outbreak.


long as it's loud in there."
The panelists discussed the
balance between the marching
band's playing traditional songs
versus the loudspeaker system's
playing popular rock and rap
songs.
Bacon and Pasquale agreed
that piped-in music was impor-
tant to keep band music fresh
and to appeal to a younger crowd.
Pasquale mentioned that it wasn't
a battle between the University
Athletic Department and the
marching band.
"Understand this: When they
play it, they ask us first," he said.
Bacon did mention that he
believed piped-in music should
be played less.
"What you're selling at Foot-
ball Saturdays, I'm sorry, is not
Beyonce or Seven Nation Army,"
Bacon said. "It's the Michigan
Marching Band, the team, the
fans - that goes back a century.
What we're trying to do on a
Football Saturday is to step back
in time to the experience of your
grandparents and great-grand-
parents."

The panelists also discussed
the history and importance of
playing the Star-Spangled Ban-
ner before games. Ristovski said
it gave her a lot of pride to hear it
before every game.
"You think about all the peo-
ple that have fought and died;
for me, to be at the University
of Michigan playing basketball
gives you pride but also a lot of
gratitude," she said.
Pasquale said the anthem was
a special moment for fans to
bond.
"It's the only time that every-
bodyis on the same page," he said.
The panel also focused on
composer David Barrett, an Ann
Arborite who composed the
famous "One Shining Moment"
in 1987. The song has been used
as the theme song for the NCAA
Men's Basketball Final Four for
27 years.
"Strange as it may sound, I
wrote the entire lyrics on a napkin
while waiting for a friend to show
up to brunch," Barrett said. "And
then I rushed home and wrote the
song in twenty minutes."

FUNDING
From Page 1A
His administration has called it
a "strategic reinvestment." His
opponent, Schauer, has criticized
the initial reduction of funding,
pledging to restore funding com-
pletely and immediately if elected.
Snyder's reinvestment strategy
has generally been met with opti-
mism from institutions across the
state. The fluctuations in funding
follow an overall trend of cuts to
higher education funding over the
past decade, though none nearly as
individually severe as15 percent.
Jason Cody, a public affairs
specialist at Michigan State Uni-
versity, called the latest budget a
positive sign for higher education
by both the governor and the leg-
islature in a statement. The bud-
get is proposed by the governor
in conjunction with the budget
office, but needs approval from the
legislature.
"This is a major step in the right
direction, continuing the positive
trend of increasing funding after
years of reducing state aid,"he said.
Officials from the University of
Michigan, Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity and the Presidents Coun-
cil, State Universities of Michigan
echoed Cody's sentiment. Other
state institutions did not reply to
requests for comment.
"Since (the 2011 cut) the news
has been good, it's been very
positive," said PCSUM Executive
Director Dr. Michael Boulus. "The
governor has made his intentions
clear that he wants to restore the
money he has cut over the next
year or two. It looks like we're out
of the woods in terms of having to
plan budgets and tuition around a
negative number."
Beyond the general reinvest-
ment strategy, several changes
to how appropriations are allo-
cated to universities have also
been implemented during Sny-
der's administration. As of the
2015 fiscal year, universities will
be measured across seven key
criteria, including number of Pell
Grant recipients, six-year gradu-
ation rates, degree completion
in critical areas, administrative
costs, research and development,
total degree completion and caps
on tuition. These metrics, first
implemented in 2012, represent a
mixture of recommendations and
modifications from both the gov-
ernor and the legislature, who also
play arole in setting the standards.
How much money they affect
has fluctuated, but currently,
roughly 50 percent of each year's
increase is based on meeting six
performance-based standards,
with all of that money subsequent-
ly beingcontingent on universities
stayingwithin a cap set on tuition
increases, the seventh metric.
Among the metrics, the cap on
tuition rate increases has proven

the most controversial. Though
most universities - with the
exception of Wayne State Uni-
versity's 8.9 percent raise in 2013
- have stuck to the limits set by
the governor and legislature, they
haven't seen much institutional
support.
"We have long argued, and we
are not alone, that the decisions
about the University's budget
model and its financial well being
are ones that the University lead-
ership- and Iinclude inthatlead-
ership the very importantBoard of
Regents - should maintain," said
Cynthia Wilbanks the Universi-
ty's vice president for government
relations. "They are, after all, the
ones that are closest to the details
of the budget models and they
have ample opportunity to learn
and be involved in the discus-
sions around how the University
is going to manage, either through
difficult times or otherwise."
Over the past decade, tuition
and appropriations have together
come to make up almost 75 per-
cent of the state's public univer-
sities' operating revenue, with
raising tuition serving as one
recourse to budgetary issues such
as rising costs or negative trends
in state funding. At the University,
tuition is almost 70 percent of the
general fund budget as of 2012.
In a conference call with col-
lege newspapers Wednesday
afternoon, Snyder said he thought
the tuition increase caps had been
a successful measure. He added
that moving forward, he'd like to
focus on ways to help universi-
ties lower their costs, potentially
through efforts to consolidate
IT platforms between schools or
through schools purchasing need-
ed goods and services as a group.
"I want to work on a more
extensive dialogue with the uni-
versities and the community col-
leges themselves in being more
helpful on how to contain their
cost," he said. "There's ways we
can work together on doing pur-
chasing and buying and ways to be
more efficient and other ways we
mightbeable to provide resources
to help them manage their costs or
bringdowntheir costs."
Along with the tuition caps, uni-
versities are also evaluated under
six other performance-based met-
rics tied to roughly 50 percent of
each year's increases in funding. As
of the 2015 fiscal year, universities
will be measured on the number of
Pell Grant recipients, six-year grad-
uation rates, degree completion in
critical areas, administrative costs,
research and development, total
degree completion and the caps on
tuition.
Within the measures, universi-
ties are also only compared to insti-
tutions considered their peers - an
aspect Wilbanks said was critical.
"We wanted to be compared
to institutions across the country
who were alike in many regards,

and by way of that similarity, the
public could judge, and certainly
policymakers could judge, how
the universities stack up with
institutions across the country
that were similar," she said. "And
that has been a useful tool."
Boulus said PCSUM, who along
with groups including the Busi-
ness Leaders for Michigan and
the state's universities helped to
define the peer-based metrics,
have overall been pleased withthe
final results.
"The governor made it clear to
us he's big on accountability and
he told us you can lead, or be led,
and we opted to lead," he said. "I
think we're very, very proud of
the fact that we really stepped up
to the issue of accountability and
transparency, and we did it in a
way thatwethink is fair."
Several institutions, including
Wayne State University and East-
ern Michigan University, while not-
ing support for the metrics being
used to evaluate performance, have
expressedconcernsabouttheimpact
of being classed together with cam-
puses that have relatively fewer
lower-income students. The addition
of Pell Grants for the upcoming fis-
cal year, the newest metric, aims to
resolve that problem.
"Factoring in Pell Grant recipi-
ents supports institutions of oppor-
tunity, such as Eastern Michigan
and Wayne State, where thousands
of lower-income students attend
and succeed in achievinga degree,"
Geoff Larcom, EMU executive
director of media relations, said in
astatement.
The second hallmark of the
governor's reforms to education
funding, caps on tuition hikes
which are contingent with receiv-
ing any of the performance based
funding, have proven the most
controversial. Though most uni-
versities have stuck to the limits
set by the governor and legisla-
ture, theyhaven'tseen muchinsti-
tutional support.
Snyder also pushed for several
cost management measures tar-
geted to a more individual level,
encouraging dual enrollment and
career and technical education
programs. He identified both in a
gubernatorial debate Sunday as a
priority for a second term.
While in office, the governor
has successfully proposed initia-
tives that increased the amount of
students and institutions eligible
for dual enrollment opportuni-
ties in the state, as well as initiat-
ing programs that match students
early with employers through
apprenticeships.
"Dual enrollment is the biggest
single saver for people because
that can bring down your costs by
25 percent on a bachelor's degree
and 50 percent on an associate's
degree," Snyder said. "It's an
opportunity to get a year of col-
lege done while you're still in high
school."

which halts discrimination in
1 housing and employment and pro-
tects the LGBT community.
"I don't believe in discrimi-
nation," Snyder said. "I'm being
proactive in terms of the employ-
ment discrimination issue in part

because that is something that can
be addressed from the legislative
point of view."
Snyder also made mention of
sexual assault on college cam-
puses. While no piece of legisla-
tion specifically deals with this
topic, Snyder discussed bills that
address sexual assault as a whole
in the state, such as legislation
passed Tuesday establishing rules
for the submission and collection

of sexual assault kit evidence. He
said rape on college campuses is
an issue.
"That's a real concern because
there's too much of that going on,"
Snyder said. "It's a discussion point
and concern that I think we're try-
ing to gather data and work with
the higher ed. community in par-
ticular and seeing what the situa-
tion is and how we can make our
campuses safer."

time. Given the time and guid-
ance to work through problems in
an environment less constrained
by the pressures and the threat
of failure imposed by tests, more
students, even the ones who didn't
believe in themselves at first, might
experience success, ultimately giv-
ing them self-confidence and skills
for future study.
In classrooms with a structured
curriculum and limited resources,
that kind of environment and
continual practice isn't always
easy to provide. According to
Kimball, "even for young kids,

school is kind of high pressure."
In an environment outside of or
after school, that pressure might
be limited, allowing more time for
mistakes, and more time to work
through and find the right answer.
As I've noted from the outset,
I'm not a STEM major. Unlike some
of our politicians and business
leaders, I'm not totally convinced
that the fact that so many people
want to major in non-STEM fields
is quite the problem it's been made
it out to be. However, the reason
why some students might avoid
STEM education is a problem. The

idea that people that might not
pursue something - anything -
because of an erroneous belief that
that they can't succeed in that area,
reinforced by their experiences in
school, is something that we've got
to change. In addition to current
solutions, creating an environment
where students believe that they
can succeed will invariably create
more successes. All things equal,
that is something worth pursuing.

uring Fall Break I had a bit more time
for leisure activities, so I spent some
time browsing social media sites, Face-
book, Instagram, etc. While
scrolling through Facebook,
a friend shared a link to a
Yahoo article titled, "Chris
Brown Thinks Ebola Is a r
FormofPopulationControl."
Being a fan of the well-3
known R&B singer wasn't
the sole reason for clicking
on the article. "Thinks Ebola SIERRA
Is a Form of Population BROWN
Control" really stuck out
and bothered me. I hoped
Brown's thoughts were misconstrued, because
no one in their right mind could possibly
compare the deaths resulting from Ebola to
population control. Thus, I began reading the
article with the anticipation that its contents
wouldn't be as bad as the title made it sound.
The article disclosed that Chris Brown shared
his thoughts concerning Ebola on Twitter. He
apparently tweeted, "I don't know ... But I think
this Ebola epidemic is a form of population
control. S--t is getting crazy bruh." Wanting
this tweet to be somewhat of a bad joke, I typed
it into Google and found many other sources
restating the claims of the Yahoo article. In a
matter of seconds I received about 2,270,000
results referring to Chris Brown'stweet.
After offering his thoughts on the Ebola
outbreak, many of Brown's 13.7 million Twitter
followers disagreed with his judgment. Minutes
after his first tweet, Brown tweeted, "Let me
shut my black a-- up!" That would probably be
best. The comment seemed very unnecessary
and slightly ignorant. Was Brown hinting that
governments are screwed up enough to target
people through an infectious and fatal disease? If
so, what proofhad he beengiven?Maybe he tried
his luck at saying something intelligent but his

comments backfired. Perhapsahe was regretful of
his Ebola tweet, and tried to retract it by sending
his secondtweetaboutshuttingup.
However, the outrage and angry tweets did
not cease. @TheMichaelMoran tweeted, "You
know what the discussion of the Ebola epidemic
needed? More stupid. Here comes Chris Brown."
@WarrenHolstein stated, "Chris Brown
tweeted that Ebola is 'a form of population
control.' He should try it."
@MyPresidentPK commented, "Chris
Brown's wondering if Ebola is a form of
population control Obviously it isn't. DUH. If it
was, we would have given it to him first."
While some of these tweets may seem a bit
harsh, it's not hard to see why his Twitter follow-
ers were upset. The Ebola outbreak has caused
more than 4,000 deaths, according to the World
Health Organization. While it affected multiple
countries in West Africa, cases were diagnosed
in Spain as well as the United States. Recently, a
U.S. patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died and the
nurse treating him, Nina Pham, tested positive
for the disease. Thus, the Ebola outbreak is noth-
ing short of dangerous and deadly. For this to be
the case, it seems highly unnecessary to suggest
that these sudden, unfortunate deaths are a form
of population control.
However, not all of Chris Brown's
followers had negative feedback. ABC 7, Los
Angeles, released an article sharing tweets
from supporters of Brown's Ebola theory. @
MaronzioVance tweeted, "Hate to say it. But
I agree with Chris Brown for the first time
ever. Ebola is a form of population control.
Love it or leave it." Since more than a few
people agreed with the popular singer, maybe
he's not as crazy as many write him off as. Is
it possible that he's just brave enough to say
what many people are thinking?

If you really want STEM majors....

So let me start by saying that I'm
not studying science, technology,
engineering or math - otherwise
known as the STEM fields.
So you might be wonder
why, as someone much
more interested in history 0
and politics, I am writing
anything about math and
science.
Let me explain.
For the past couple of
years, there has been a VICTORIA
litany of calls for more NOBLE
STEM majors to fill the
halls of our universities
and to eventually innovate enough to propel
our economy into the future. There have been
economic concerns, notably that "only 5% of
U.S. workers are employed in fields related to
science and engineering, yet they are respon-
sible for more than 50% of our sustained eco-
nomic expansion," as business leader Rodney
C. Adkins wrote in a 2012 Forbes piece. What
is even more worrying from this perspective
is that other countries are educating far more
of STEM majors than the United States. Ever
concerned with the possibility of U.S. decline,
politicians at every level have weighed in with
a variety of solutions to combat the decline of
interest in math and sciences.
This election cycle, we will almost
certainly hear just as many if not more of
these ideas. According to Michigan.gov, Gov.
Rick Snyder called for Michigan to become
a leader providing opportunities for STEM
education. Snyder backed up these words by
spending $3 million and allocating another
$2 million in the 2015 education budget for
FIRST Robotics - a program that tasks
student participants with designing, building
and financing robots. The robots then duke it
out with other teams' robots in competition.
It's clear from his commendable actions that
our governor is incredibly serious about
training more students in the STEM fields.
But, as someone who never seriously
considered majoring in the math or science
fields, I wondered if these programs or any of
the others I've heard discussed in the news
would've done much to sway my interests
growing up. While I'm sure that the new
push to inspire an interest in the STEM fields
is effective for many people, I know that for
me, any intervention would have had to start
much younger.
In school, I was always better at writing
and reading than I was at math and science,
even from a young age. While I was never bad
at math per se, I was never really good at it
either. I grasped other subjects much more
quickly and intuitively, even as I struggled
with basic computational math, and later,

struggled to apply that math to science. I
grew to assume that my talents lay elsewhere,
and proceed to put much more time and
enthusiasm into other subjects.
Consequently, by adopting a hesitant
attitude toward math at a young age, I
probably never learned the building blocks of
the subject thoroughly. When it came time to
learn things like pre-algebra, I was already
somewhat behind on basic concepts, and
learning new ones took much more effort for
me than it seemed to for many of my peers.
I assumed that this just wasn't going to be
something I was good at. Simultaneously, I
experienced success in other academic areas,
and so ruled out a career in engineering or
the sciences before I had even taken my first
chemistry or algebra classes.
Last year, I read an article by Economics
Prof. Miles Kimball and Noah Smith, an
assistant professor at Stony Brook University,
about "the myth of inborn genetic math
ability." To these two (rather credible)
writers, the misconception that some people
just aren't good at math posed a big problem,
because, "for high school math, inborn talent
is just much less important than hard work,
preparation, and self-confidence." Which
makes a lot of sense ... but for 12-year-old me,
this myth was my reality.
Intrigued by the article, I interviewed
Prof. Kimball about what he thought might
be done to improve students' interest in math
(in addition to the suggestions he outlined in
another article). He suggested that what we
might do is give students more opportunities
to do math outside of school, suggesting
having "math clubs as ubiquitous as cub
scout troops," where students could go to
learn and develop their math skills. He added
that "the idea of a math club is for kids who
especially like math. But I'm thinking of it ...
like the Cub scouts." He elaborated by saying,
"parents have their kids their kids go to cub
scouts ... or Girl scouts ... even if they're not
extra interested in camping," implying that
math concepts are, or should be, something
that everyone be encouraged to explore. To
me, creating a space for children to work on
concepts they have (or haven't) struggled
with consistently enough to create progress
seems like something that might really help
students who don't believe in their own
ability to learn math and science.
Working on difficult concepts in a low-
pressure environment, students might feel
more free to make mistakes and try new
things. I can certainly attest to the fact that
everyone approaches math and science dif-
ferently - I was forever the student looking
at problems differently than my teachers
expected or would've liked. I now recognize
that as an asset, but it felt like a failure at the

When I wasyounger,mymother's
resonating mantra was, "Stay out of
the sun." She'd sometimes scold me
for playing outside too long when
she'd come home from work and
comment on how dark my face had
gotten. She would scrub both of our
skin with a homemade concoction
of chickpea flour, turmeric and
olive oil that was supposed to
lighten our complexions.
"You were the fairest baby in the
Maharashtra hospital, Anu. All the
nurses told you were such a pretty
baby. Now? Kanna, you look like a
beggar child."Shewould sayKanna,
in Tamil - my first language - for
"my eyes," with more love than I
can - even now - know.
My mother is one of the most
intelligent people I know. Growing
up in South India, she always made
the highest grades in her classes and
is so gifted at math that she became
the only female calculus professor
at a top college there. She and my
father met at a bus stop and have
what relatives would call, clucking
their tongues, a love marriage. This
ista term that seems redundant
to me, but is shrouded in scandal,
indicating that their marriage is
not arranged and not sanctioned by
their families. My mother is several
shades darker than my father, a
stigma that has followed her across
an ocean to America. In India, fair
is beautiful; dark is irrelevant. Miss
India, year after year, looks more
white than Indian. The most recent
Miss America, Nina Davuluri, is
too "dusky" to ever win an Indian
beauty pageant.
My mother loved that her daugh-
ter was relatively light-skinned for
a South Indian. At Indian parties,
I felt gaudy in the layers of bright
silk and chiffon she'd dressed me
in and overdone under the founda-
tion and powder that she'd caked
onto my skin. "You're glowing," she
would whisper, squeezing my hand.
"You're beautiful." I can't quite
describe the way I felt when she
called me beautiful. I always went
to the bathroom to look in the mir-
ror whenever she did, to touch my
face, and to try to see what exact-
ly had elicited her compliment. I
couldn't stop smiling all night.
We visited India over my winter
break in seventh grade. My dark-
skinned cousins would look at
me in awe, teasing me and saying
that I should act in Bollywood
movies. A stranger on the street
once asked me if he could touch the
underside of my arm. It was so fair.
In America, I'd never even gotten a
second glance. I wasn't allowed to
walk down the streets of Chenna
without my uncle or dad because -
as I'd overheard my mother telling
my aunt one day - the men looked
at me as though they were in a mitai
kada - a candy store. Even with the
distress in her voice, I could still
hear an unmistakable hint of pride.
During the summer, if I spent
my time safely indoors, reading or
studying, I could maintain a light,
high-yellow complexion and my
mother's approval. My life grew
counter to the arc of the sun. Where
it was, I was not. Sunnydays became
a burden: even one hour outside
could significantly darken my
complexion. I hated playing sports,
going to the park, and, especially,
going to the beach because I would
feel sick the whole time I was
there, worrying about how dark I

was undoubtedly getting. Around
this time, my mother showed me
a strange product called Fair and
Lovely. You can only find it on the
dusty shelves of Indian grocery

stores. The label displayed a dark-
skinned model, looking sadly
into the distance and becoming
progressively happier as her skin
became progressively paler, thanks
to this "miracle cream." These
were, after all, the rules: dark =
unhappy; light = happy. The first
time I put the cream on my face,
my skin felt synthetic, cold, and it
stung delicately. I started using it
religiously, believing completely
that I was in need of a miracle.
When I started high school, my
skin naturally became a couple
shades darker, much to everyone's
dismay. I remember that in ninth
grade I won first place at a local
debate tournament. The trophy
was a framed candid photo of me
delivering our team's champion-
ship-winning speech under harsh
fluorescent lighting. The dollar-
store frame somehow felt heavy in
my clenched hands: the words "First
Place Speaker, Okemos Debate Clas-
sic" were printed at the base of the
photo in white Arial font. But all
I could do was stare at my image,
my features nearly imperceptible
against my dark face. Had I really
gotten so dark this summer?
I've forgotten everything else
about that day. All I remember is
that I'd slipped the picture into
my backpack and waited until I
was home to tiptoe to my room
and shove it into the back of my
closet, so I wouldn't have to show
my mother. I'd learned young, this
awful habit of putting up a facade,
of preempting hurt. I lived in the
shadow of my appearance.
Only when I left for Michigan
did the facade begin to crack. The
first time a white boy told me he
thought the color of my tanned
skin was "hot as fuck," I was the
drunkest I've ever been. I ran to the
bathroom to throw up but ended
up sitting there, staring at the floor
in a daze. I'd made straight 'As'
throughout my life, I was eloquent,
and I had friends who loved me. Yet
a stranger who had just wanted to
get into my pants had the power to
do something I couldn't: make me
feel beautiful in my skin. A friend
pushed her way into the bathroom
and freaked out when she saw the
tears on my face, demanding I tell
her what the hell had happened.
I tried to articulate (but ended up
slurring) that it was September and
how much I hated the way my skin
looked in the fall and whatFair and
Lovely was and why I sometimes
used it. She held my hair back and
responded softly, "Now that's some
racist shit."
Even through the Crystal Palace
haze, her words had stung. I'd
never thought of it as racism. I was
18 at the time, a self-proclaimed
humanist, and damn proud of how
open-minded I'd grown to be. I was
certainly no racist.
Well, except for a tendency to
think dark skin was ugly.
It was slow, the transition. It
would take friends who would, in
March, put their arms around my
shoulders and say, "You need some
sun, girl! We're getting pasty!" It
would take friends who would throw
tubes of lightening cream from my
makeup bag into the trash and ask,
"The hell is wrong with you, Anitha?
This shit is gonna give you cancer."
It would take friends who would
drag me to the lake and tell me I
looked hot that day and teach me

how to kayak and make me forget
about howI looked altogether.
Only recently did I finally find
the courage to say no to my mother
when she told me not to spend too

much time in the sun. I was just
leaving our house to play tennis
with a friend, and she was wash-
ing dishes at the sink. I don't know
how I'd expected her to react. Did
I expect her to scream? She'd just
stopped and hesitated. She cocked
her head at me, looking into my eyes
as though she were looking at me for
the first time and responded, "No?"
I stared back, unblinking, 'Amma,
I just want to play tennis right
now, OK? That's all I want to worry
about right now - is that OK?" A
heavy look overcame her face, and a
remorseful apology began to form in
my throat. But I just kept staring at
her. She dropped her gaze and said,
plainly, "OK, Kanna. Be safe." And
she wentback to scrubbing the dish-
es, as though nothing had changed.
When I was younger, I felt
endlessly victimized by my mother's
domineering expectations. But
these days, each time I see her, she
looks less domineering and more
human, more tired. Last August, we
went to the mall and she wanted to
stop by the Clinique counter to pick
up some foundation. She picked up
a shade of foundation the color of
sand, of a Bollywood starlet, but
not of herself, and began to apply
it. The classically white salesgirl,
likely with the best intentions,
practically pulled the bottle from
my mother's hands,
"Ma'am, your skin is much too
dark for that shade of foundation.
Why don't you try something a little
more natural?"
She replaced it with another one,
the color of what I might describe as
milk chocolate. But I could tell from
the pain in my mother's eyes that
she wouldn't have described it that
way. To her, the color was heavy,
one weighted by a culture and a
bias she'd never been able to leave
behind in India. I knew that shewas
too self-conscious of her English
and of her race to tell the salesgirl
to fuck off, that she would buy the
foundation, and that it would sit,
forever unopened, in some drawer
in our house. I immediately took the
bottle from my mother and shoved
it back to the salesgirl, telling her to
have a nice day.
After, I took my mother to the
food court, and we shared a jalapeno
soft pretzel - spicy, our favorite. I
told her, somewhat sheepishly, that
I thought she was beautiful, with or
without any dumb foundation. She
looked startled. I guess that was,
for some reason, the first time I'd
called her "beautiful." She told me
so frequently; how had it taken me
so long to say it back? We were both,
I suppose, victims of a world that we
had allowed to define us.
"Thank you." She touched
my hand, "I always wonder how
I ended up with a daughter as
wonderful as you."
I think (all the time) about the
things I'll someday teach my own
daughter. She will know about
grammar and kindness and about
being patient and being passionate.
She will know what it's like to
break hearts and to have her heart
broken. She will know when to
hold her tongue and when to hold
her own. I'll take her to the beach,
and she will know how to swim
and how to snorkel and canoe and
raft. And maybe we will just sit in
the sand and watch the water for
hours and know what it's like to feel
indomitable and infinite.

But she will never, ever know the
unbearable weight of sunlight.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
Before PSU,'M'
back to rankings

Bye week comes at perfect time

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS
Daily Sports Writer
With the unveiling of
Tuesday's Coaches' Poll, the
Michigan
women's soccer
team returned Penn State
to the national at Michigan
rankings for
the first time Matchup:
aince it was Peas State
12-2; Michigan
 ranked No. 7 in 11-3
the preseason.
How do the Tursday
Wolverines 7 P.M.
feel about their
spot in the Where:
rankings? Add Staidum
it to the list of
off-the-field
affairs with which the they are
not concerned.
"I honestly had no idea we
even got ranked," said senior
defender Jen Pace. "I haven't
been paying attention to it, just
preparing for today and this
weekend."
Added Michigan coach Greg
Ryan: "I didn't know we were
ranked. I haven't had any idea
where we stand in the Big Ten all
year long. I just look at the next
game. That's been the approach
of the whole team."
The 24th-ranked Wolverines
(7-1 Big Ten, 11-3 overall) are
preparing for perhaps their
toughest game of the season
when they square off with No. 11
Penn State on Thursday night at
U-M Soccer Stadium.
Penn State (7-1, 12-2) has
allowed just three goals in
conference play this season. The
NittanyLions played inthe finals
of the 2013 NCAA Tournament,
and have consistently finished
near the top of the Big Ten
standings. They boast a roster of
experience, talent and stability.
ATHLETICS
From Page 1A
he said athletics could come up
during the public comments por-
tion of the meeting.
During public comments,
members of the public are given
the opportunity to address the
board for up to five minutes.
Regents sometimes respond
to these comments from their
table, but often do not. Public
commenters are required to sign-
up for a speaking slot the day
before the meeting.
The Athletic Department has
been under scrutiny following
Morris' injury when he was
diagnosed with a "probable, mild
concussion"suffered in the fourth
quarter, but was left in the game.
Michigan Football Coach Brady
Hoke and University Athletic
Director Dave Brandon have been
under fire since the incident, with
students organizing a petition
calling for Brandon's firing
and organizing an impromptu
"Fire Dave Brandon" rally
that eventually congregated
on University President Mark
Schlissel's front lawn.
i However, the regents can
only advise University President
Schlissel on personnel matters.

Schlissel is the only one with

But Ryan isn't waving the
white flag.
"Our strategy is to have the
attitude that we're going to get
our chances and we're going to
go after you," Ryan said. "We
can't come out here and defend
for 90 minutes and win. We're
very confident in our attacking
players to break down this back
line and get some chances."
Ryan's confidence seems
justified. His Wolverines have
won four consecutive games and
nine of their last 10.
The offensive catalyst during
Michigan's recent success has
been forward Nicky Waldeck.
The sophomore has scored five
goals in her past three games,
and is tied for second place in
the Big Ten in points.
"I know they have a really
strongback line, but I think as an
attacking group we're going to
get a lot of good opportunities,"
Waldeck said. "They haven't
allowed a lot, of goals but Ani
(Sarkisian) and I are really
good at clicking on the counter
attack."
On Thursday night, the
Wolverines will have their
own Under the Lights affair
against a premier opponent.
Still, Michigan, as it has been
all season, is unfazed by the
potential for pressure. Once
the ball kicks off on Thursday
night, the Wolverines will be
at it once again, fighting for the
only result or ranking they have
cared about all season: winning
the soccer game.
"We're not reading our press
clippings," Ryan said. "All of
that is just a distraction from
the job. For a young team, we've
been amazing at focusing on
what counts. This team has been
steadily climbing, just focused
on the next game."

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan's bye week could
not come at a better time.
After losing three straight
games, the Wolverines grabbed
their elusive third victory, an
18-13 Under the Lightswin over
Penn State. Now, Michigan
(1-2 Big Ten, 3-4 overall) gets
its chance to breathe. It's the
latest bye week since the 2011
season.
"It's happening at a good
time as far as we get some
rest," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke on Saturday. "The
guys get away from us a little
bit, which is always positive,
and probably more positive for
them than me because I worry
about them.
"But Ithink it's good that we
have a change for them to get
rested up a little bit."
Despite Hoke's refusal to
talk about injuries on a weekly
basis, there are still a number
of starters battling both long-
standing and recent ones.
"It's important for guys to
heal up and get their legs back,"
said sophomore wide receiver
Amara Darboh. "I'm going to
be looking at a lot of film and
I know a lot of other guys are
too, so we're going to rest the
body, but we're going to be in
there mentally."
Senior linebacker Desmond
Morgan has been out since the
season opener. On Wednesday,
Hoke didn'tdenythe possibility
of Morgan applying for a
medical redshirt, nor did he
confirm anything. Sophomore
safety Delano Hill and
freshman cornerback Jabrill
Peppers have each been out
the past three weeks battling
apparent leg injuries, but
neither has redshirt eligibility
for this season.
More so, sophomore
defensive tackle Willie Henry

did not see action against
Penn State, despite dressing,
due to an apparent hand
injury sustained on a sack
against Rutgers. Sophomore
wide receiver Jehu Chesson,
who has started alongside
junior Devin Funchess, didn't
dress Saturday because of an
undisclosed injury. But Darboh
was able to start instead, and
did so with aplomb.
To add to the list, sophomore
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow
was limited against the
Nittany Lions, but Hoke hasn't
disclosed the issue.
The list grows longer if you
include Funchess, who said
earlier this season he'd be
playing banged up the rest of
the year.
And fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
went down with a leg injury
against Penn State, but was
able to come back two drives
later.
"I can't wait for the
bye week," Gardner said
Saturday after the game. "For
everything. I can't wait. It's
going to be great."
On top of much-needed time
to overcome injuries, it can't be
ignored that Michigan's next
opponent is its toughest on the
schedule - No. 8 Michigan
State.
The Wolverines will need
their defense to be at its
healthiest this season to slow

The Michiganfootball team gets a much-needed bye week - the latest scheduled
since 2011 - to heal and rest nearly a dozen players who remain injured.

his salary, as well as remaining

$3 million.,
Fitzgerald saidthe regentshave
broad oversight responsibilities
over the entire university, but do
not have any specific directives
related to policymaking for
University athletics. In recent
months, most of board votes
relatedtotheAthleticDepartment
pertained to facilities. In
September, the regents approved
the construction of a $168 million
athletics performance space for
South Campus. Over the summer,
the board voted down a proposal
to launch fireworks at last
weekend's night football game
against Penn State.
Many students see the Morris
incident as the tipping point fol-
lowing a string of problems with
athletics, including the perma-
nent separation of former kicker
Brendan Gibbons and issues with
the student ticket policy.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily last week, Schlissel
said a review of the University's
student-athlete safety policies are
underway and he expects a report
to be delivered to the public in the

next fewweeks.
He cited safety as his first pri-
ority and declined to discuss the
possibility of personnel changes
within the Athletic Department.
"I don't talk about personnel
matters in public or in
newspapers," Schlissel said.
"As a principle of the humane
treatment of colleagues as well
as the appropriateness of privacy
of personnel matters. They're not
public matters so I don't address
hiring or firing. It's just not the
right thing to do in public."
Schlissel reiterated that he
is ultimately responsible for
personnel decisions and said his
job is to help the institution's
executive officers ensure the
University functions in the most
effective way possible.
"One thing I like to do is be a
little more thoughtful and reflec-
tive... People get very excited and
they jump to conclusions. Some-
times the conclusions are right
and sometimes they're not and I
really feel that my job is to learn

wumstances I'm responsible for...

diacy to them, like player safety,
but the bigger issues of how we
can make our athletics program
more connected to our under-
graduate students, to our alums,

said. "One minute, I'm sitting

But the moment didn't
prove to be too large. Soon
after Nagelvoort entered, the
Wolverines took a penalty and
shots started pouring on him.
No pucks found twine, though.

helped the Wolverines to a 3-2,

Hampshire.

Bumpy Burger is a
pain in the ass, and
that's why I love it

baked.buzzed.bored.
in this series, three daily arts writers in
varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:
(The New) Bumpy Burger

I

nlike at the DMV,
where you wait in
boredom for your
turn with bureaucratic tedi-
um, a line at a restaurant is
an exercise
in anticipa-
tion. At the
back, all
you can see
are patrons'
heads, all,
bobbing
and buzzing GIANCARLO
like excited BUONOMO
electrons.
Closer up,
maybe you hear the clang of
a spatula scraping against
the grill, or the sweet smell
of frying onions. You finally
get to the front, and all those
anxious minutes of obsess-
ing over the minutiae of your
meal - Fries or onion rings?
Mustard AND mayo? Do I
dare? - come to the ultimate
conclusion.
If I sound a little hyperbol-
ic, it's because waiting in line
can make even the most cyni-
cal, food-is-fuel person start
waxing poetic about how
many pickle slices they want
on their burger. In our era of
online ordering and pre-made
everything, having to wait is
a shock to the system.
If you've spent any time
in Ann Arbor, you probably
know where I'm going with
this. Krazy Jim's Blimpy
Burger, founded in 1953 and
recently reopened in its new
location on South Ashley, is a
local institution. Its attitude
towards food is best summed
up in the inantra written on
the wall: "We have a fat free
item on the menu ... It's called
water!" Every travel and food
show has done a segment
there. It's pretty much every
student's favorite burger
joint.
It's also the ultimate wait-
for-your-food kind of place.

when you have some of your

The best thing about being high is that everything, even the most
mundane, boring, wouldn't-be-interesting-even-if-it-was-dipped-in-
liquid-fudge (mmmmm fudge) things become funny. I sprayed some
smoke through my showerhead pert and then began the long walk to
Blimpy, with an equally high friend who kept asking me if I would be
cool with him performing fellatio on a geriatric zebra - what canI
say, he's a man of charity. Together, we make a wonderful raoul duke
and dr gonzo. The walk to blimpy is long, but each side of the street
keeps reverberating like a '70s radio station, and I'm just vibing. Even
in line, I keep giggling at the absurdity of having a bear as the mascot
for a burger place. I mean, I'm all for transcending our diet from the
basic beef-pork-chicken, but bear meat sounds a little funky.

way to the Tattoo Parlor with Christopher Walken's face in the window
("Walkens Welcome" - GET IT!?) Yay! My mouth is numb but I'm so
hungry I know I'll scarf the burger and fries down before I even remem-
ber to savor it. Hey, my legs are a little tired. I think I'm just gonna lean
against this trash can and OHMIGOD THAT THING'S ON WHEELS.
Steady, steady. Just grab a paper menu. One menu. Come on just one
menu! We're standing in line so long that I memorize my answers to all
the questions they're gonna ask me. "How many patties?" Three. "Bun?"
Regular. "Anything grilled?" Onions and peppers. "Cheese?" Yes, please.
"What kind of cheese?" Huh? "What kind of cheese?" Wait, there are dif-
ferent kinds ofcheeses? Shit, uhhh what's a kind ofcheese? What'sjust that
normal kind called? "Uhhhhhh... regular?""'Regular?""'Ummm...""You
mean 'American'?" "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure." Even the stuffed polar bear
next to the cash register is looking at me with disdain.
- DAILY ARTS WRITER
I am extremely jealous of my companions for having substances to
help them through the hell that is the Blimpy Burger line.
It's almost 1:00, and I'm hungrier than I've ever been in my entire
life (notlan exaggeration). The line is just reaching the door, and at any
other fast food place, I'd assume it'd be a manageable 20 minutes before
I had a sweet, sweet pile of french fries in my life. But the fortyish min-
utes we spend inching toward that holy grail of grills feels like fortyish
hours.
Baked and his roommate appear to be having a pretty chill time, talk-
ing about long lines at restaurants in Maine. I am not amused. There
are no comparisons to this experience. I see a business casual man bal-
ance his stacked quad burger plus onion rings on atray and sit down at
a table too close to the line. I seriously consider befriending or seducing
him, because those onion rings look UNBELIEVABLE. When I remem-
ber that I shouldn't use my babe-a-licious good looks to steal food
(because I'm an Honorable Person), I just decide to sulk in quiet and
just stare at the man's food.
He notices. It's weird. But I'm almost at the front of the line, so it's
OK.
I ordera veggie burger and fries, and about ten minutes pass from
the moment that beautiful package is placed on my tray until every bite
of food is gone. (For the record, I finished my food faster than my three
male companions. I am crushingthe patriarchy.) In retrospect, the deli-
cious heart attack on a bun was totally worth it. I might even jump in
line again right now...

WASTE OF TIME...

@MICHIGANDAILY

SINGLE REVIEW

From the very beginning of
her rise to fame, Taylor Swift's
music has carried a few dis-
tinct themes.
Vague yet
highly specific
metaphors, Out of the
intimate and Woods
unexplained
references for Taylor Swift
her fans to Big Machine
revel in and
a trademark
obsession with won and lost
loves are just a few of Swift's
repeated sonic elements. Her
newestsingle "Out of the
Woods," off her upcoming
album1989, fulfills each of these
prerequisites but with one inge-
nious and altering addition: Jack
Antonoff.
The production styles of pre-
vious classic T. Swift country
pop hits have followed a specific
formative process. Most begin
as a cute, acoustic and mal-
leable country love song with a
great melody thatcan be easily
transformedby high stakes pro-
ducersfor cookie-cutter radio
hits. But here with "Out of the
Woods," Swift and Antonoff
keep the catchinessbut revamp

the process. The skeleton of this
song isn't some simple country
melody. The thoughtfulness of
Antonoff's production style for
"Out of the Woods" is incredible.
Expertly layering and synthe-
sizing his ownvoice and sounds,
Antonoff uses avintage Yamaha
DX7 for most of the song before
transferringto a very distorted,
more modern Minimoog Voy-
ager in the chorus. The song
is an'80s-inspired, exquisitely
produced pre-existing track for
which Swift added an equally
reflective melody, verse, and
chorus. This vacillation and
variety has a perfect balance
that creates a modern8's-esque
track perfect for the appropri-

ately titled1989 album of pop
queen Taylor Swift.
The alternative touches of
Antonoff paired with Swift's
lyrical and melodic skill created
this fantastic modern pop song.
Although unanimous praise for
this song is doubtful, this song is
a strong determinantof Swift's
musical progression and upcom-
ing expansion of her talents.
And of course, the song is
catchy. So catchy that you awake
the morning after buying it on
iTuneswith a fuzzy mental
hangover thatcan only be a
resultofan intense popmusic
binge - 30 listens in four hours.
Proceed with caution.

'Night of Laughs'
opens show season

Basement Arts
puts on Chekhov,
Shakespeare shorts
By ALEX BERNARD
Daily Arts Writer
Between midterms, club
obligations and problem sets,
college can seem like one dull
commit-
ment after A Night
another, A
aimless- Laughs: An
ly last- Evening of
ing until Comedic
somebody One Acts
slaps a lib-
eral arts October 17 at
degree in 7p.m. and 11 p.m.
your hand October18 at 7 p.m.
and tells Walgreens
you to find Drama Center
a new com- Free
mitment -
hopefully
one that pays.
But, as a group of young
actors will tell you, that doesn't
always have to be the case. This
Friday and Saturday, Basement
Arts puts up its first show of
the school year: "A Night of
Laughs: An Evening of Come-
dic One Acts" after just two
weeks of rehearsals.
The thirty-minute show
is a compilation of three 8 to
10 minute short scenes from
Anton Chekhov's . "The Dan-
gers of Tobacco," Shel Silver-
stein's "The Best Daddy" and
Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet."
And yet, the show isn't just a
straightforward take on scenes
that acting majors have had

memorized since ninth grade.
In Shakespeare's classic
tragedy, director and senior
Acting major Josh Aber throws
a mysterious wrench into tra-
ditional interpretations of the
classic balcony scene.
"It's a little bit of a farce ...
and out there," Aber said.
Tragically, Aber declined to
reveal more, forcing us to flip
open our Dover Thrift cop-
ies of "Romeo and Juliet" and
imagine what might be.
But the "Night of Laughs"
won't be all giggles, twists
and the dismantlement of clas-
sic works. Where one might
expect slapstick, Chekhov and
Silverstein deliver drama -
sweet refreshing drama.
"Chekhov is all very dark ...
The Chekhov one is very sad,"
Aber said. "I don't even know
if people are going to be laugh-
ing at the end ... And the Best
Daddy one; that's really really
dark. That's black comedy."
It may seem to the casual (or
even avid) theater-goer that
these scenes don't have much
in common, but Aber insists
that's what makes the comedy
so poignant.
"I kind of thought, well if
I'm doing contemporary and
Chekhov, I kind of want to
throw in a Shakespeare so
that it can follow an arc," he
said. "So it's gonna be Shake-
speare, Chekhov, contempo-
rary. Three different comedic
styles. Three different time
periods."
Though the scenes are
drastically different from one
another, they're also linked
by the mysterious "common
denominator." Once again,

Aber chose to build suspense
rather than be any more spe-
cific. One can only wonder
what he means by the "com-
mon denominator."
Whatever his twists are
though, Aber, a first-time
director, will have to spin
them quickly. In the past few
semesters, Basement Arts
shows were usually given
three weeks for rehearsals.
As the year's first production
though, Aber and his cast only
have two weeks to block, mem-
orize, rehearse and perfect the
show before opening night on
Friday. Aber expected as much
though.
"I actually asked (Basement
Arts) if I could hold auditions
before they had confirmed my
slot ... I'm actually only hav-
ing two weeks to rehearse this
because my first week I had to
use up for audition time," he
said.
Aber said the show isn't just
for theater students either.
Anyone just looking for some
free entertainment late on a
Friday night can pop in at 11
p.m. and leave smiling at 11:40.
"I'm excited for watching
the show with an audience and
hearing people laugh who've
never watched it before ...
Hopefully, I'll hear some
laughs and I'll know I did a
good job."
The scenes run at 7 p.m. and
11 p.m. on Friday and 7 p.m. on
Saturday. All Basement Arts
shows go up in the Walgreen
Drama Center and are com-
pletely, unbendingly free. No
doubt, "A Night of Laughs"
will be worth much more than
the price of admission.

GROUND
From Page 1B
James Tennis stands in a
windbreaker and Michigan cap
outside of Nickel's Arcade at
North University Avenue and
State Street - braving a brisk
October rain and covering a
stack of newspapers with a
plastic bag. The papers he's
holding are the latest issue of
"GroundcoverNews," amonthly
street newspaper designed
to provide job opportunities
to homeless and low-income
people in the Ann Arbor area,
and he sells them for one dollar
a piece.
"I've been selling here for a
whole year at Nickel's Arcade,"
Tennis says. "And they say
60,000 people walk past me a
day, so really it's been a blessing
from God."
Tennis, 40, was living with
his mother in 2013 when he
discovered Groundcover
through word-of-mouth and
went to the company's office
at Bethlehem United Church
of Christ to apply and train
for a job as a Groundcover
vendor. Since then, Tennis has
supported himself through his
paper sales alone, working hard
to develop a customer base
among University students
and Ann Arborites while
combatting the challenges of a
low-income lifestyle.
"Most of the students here
are very intellectual, very nice
and warm-hearted," Tennis
says. "And then you get some
people who are just evil and
they spit at you and talk bad
about you. It's an up-and-down
thing, but I sleep in a tent
outside, so I have to deal with
all elements: from the weather,
and from the people."
Since its first issue in April
2010, Groundcover has helped
people like Tennis get back
on their feet by providing a
more constructive alternative
to panhandling. Today, there
are around 35 active vendors
working, as Groundcover
publisher and founder Susan
Beckett describes, on the
principle of "self-reliance";
vendors receive their first 10
papers for free, which they
then sell for one dollar per
copy, and can subsequently buy
additional papers for 25 cents
each.
Before founding
Groundcover, Beckett had
worked for nearly 25 years as
a volunteer lobbyist with a
group called Results, where she
learned how microfinancing
could help to alleviate the worst
aspects of hunger and poverty
by reaching those people who
lacked access to banks or loans.
Six years ago, when visiting
her daughter in Seattle, Beckett
encountered people selling
street newspapers around
the city and realized that a
similar product could work to
benefit low-income residents
in her hometown of Ann Arbor,
so she gradually went about
formulating ideas for the
paper, presenting the concept
to her activist friends and city
officials.

In 2009, as her plan for the
non-profit was starting to
come to fruition, Beckett met
some resistance from the City
Council's downtown marketing
committee, who feared that a

street newspaper might lead
to a resurgence in downtown
panhandling, which they had
worked to reduce.
"I had been warned by one
of the people who became one
of our vendors, and she said,
'Those business people, they
don't like us, and they're going
to do everything they can to
make it not happen,"' Beckett
said. "So I kind of went to the
committee with the mindset
that I was consulting them to
see what their concerns were,
and if they had any advice, but I
was not asking permission."
Beckett went on to meet
with a representative from
the North American Street
Newspaper Association, who
set her up with a printing
company and helped her find
a $1,000 grant for the printing
of Groundcover's first issue.
Eventually, the company
moved from a small space
at St. Andrew's Church to a
larger room in the basement
of Bethlehem Church on South
Fourth Avenue to accommodate
the traffic of vendors coming in
and out for papers.
Within its first few weeks
of operation, Groundcover
had already attracted
advertisements from a number
of local establishments,
including RoosRoast Coffee
Works and By The Pound.
Today, advertisements make
up about one-third of the
company's revenue, and staff
and vendors work to secure ads
by going into local businesses
and speaking with the owners
of the companies.
In the Bethlehem Church
office, staff volunteers
distribute papers and train
new vendors on the company's
protocols regarding city
ordinances - vendors must
wear an ID badge and must be
at least a block away from one
another when selling. Once a
month, Groundcover conducts
training sessions on other
useful business-related issues.
"One of the things we do is
the advanced sales workshop
we do workshops on how to
sell advertising, basic computer
literacy, resum writing, how to
use Linkedin and Facebook,"
Beckett said. "Things that will
both help them in selling papers
and looking for a future job."
Office volunteer Keagan
Irrer, a graduate from Albion
College, said that he has
personally trained more than
40 vendors in his time at
Groundcover and witnessed
impressive progress from many
vendors over the years.
"Shawn Story, here," Irrer
said, handing me an August
2014 issue of Groundcover and
pointing at the cover photo
of a tall Black man standing
in Nickel's Arcade, "Once he
was able to get into housing,
his sales numbers just sky-
rocketed; he was able to be
in locations consistently and
establish regular customers."
"Vendor Spotlights" are
among the many recurring
pieces that make up what
Beckett, describes as
Groundcover's "eclectic"
content. Most issues feature

articles written by Groundcover
volunteers and vendors, as
well as submissions from Ann
Arbor residents. While the
October issue is politically
themed, focusing mostly on the

upcoming November elections,
past issues of the paper have
contained sections on anything
from opinion to humor to
religion.
"In general, our readership
prefers a large variety," Beckett
said. "I'd say a third of our
articles have something of a
poverty focus, and it is part
of our mission to cover those
things that nobody else does ...
but it's really hard to read page
after page about poverty stuff
and struggles."
Vendors are also trained to
be familiar with the paper's
content and use the articles as
a selling point. And though they
are equipped with a quality
product - a twelve-page paper
with four color pages - the
selling of print newspapers
remains a difficult task
anywhere in the 21st century,
especially with students.
"Honestly, the vendors find
it hard to sell anywhere except
downtown - the Main Street
area - and Kerrytown, with the
People's Food Co-op and when
the Farmer's Market is around,"
Beckett said. "But, in the last
year, the student district has
improved considerably, and I
attribute that in large part to
our student group that started
a year ago."
Nursing sophomore Jennifer
Crorey, Beckett's niece, founded
the Groundcover student group
in the summer of 2013, when
she and several volunteers
began helping out around the
office, writing articles for the
paper and searching for ways
to expand the vendors' range of
selling around campus and in
the greater Ann Arbor area.
"We were looking to get the
word out about Groundcover,
since most students didn't know
what it was," Crorey said. And
we've also been able to use the
University's resources, like last
year we got a grant from the
Ginsberg Center to make vests
for the vendors so that they can
expand to other cities and be
recognizable in those areas as
well."
Last February, the group
recruited former Michigan
Basketball player Jordan
Morgan and Ann Arbor Mayor
John Hieftje to help spread
awareness for Groundcover
by selling papers on the
streets with vendors. In a
video interview on the paper's
website, Mayor Hieftje praised
Groundcover as a "good read,"
saying, "Some people go home
and watch Fox News, or they
watch CNN, but you can learn
things in Groundcover that
you'd never see there."
In the coming years,
Susan Beckett looks to keep
expanding Groundcover's
reach beyond its current
hot spots in Ann Arbor and
downtown Ypsilanti to nearby
areas, such as Chelsea, Dexter
and Pittsfield Township. A
city ordinance in Ann Arbor
currently prohibits vendors
from selling to vehicular
traffic, and Beckett hopes to
someday get the ordinance
amended so that vendors can
perhaps sell at highway exits.

Still, Beckett's focus will
always be on finding ways to
bettersupportthe disadvantaged
people of her city, and for her, the
sale of a consistently intriguing
journalistic product seems the
best way to do so.

Stumbling
upon a poem

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Literary Columnist
here are few things
in life I love more
than poetry. Scratch
that. There are few things
in life I love more than well-
written poetry - an impor-
tant distinction. There's
something uniquely satisfying
about reading a piece where
every word seems to sink into
your skin, flush your cheeks
and sweeten on your tongue.
I highly recommend get-
ting drunk on poetry. It's
cheaper than alcohol and you
don't have to worry about
waking up the next day with
a hangover and several new,
and most likely troubling,
Tinder matches.
While I may spend a few
hours here and there explic-
itly trying to find new poems
to quench my thirst, I find
that many of my favorite
poems are those I stumbled
upon organically. I don't
know whether these poems
are enhanced by some mea-
sure of surprise or if it's all
just coincidental, but there's
something fanciful about a
perfect poem unexpectedly
falling into your hands, filled
with phrases that feel born of
your own soul.
Usually, I discover these
hidden gems through class
assignments. That's how I
found and subsequently fell
in love with Margaret Veley's
"A Japanese Fan." I was in
a class about early British
women authors when we were
given the task of finding a
little-known author, analyz-
ing one of her poems and then
commenting on another's
author.
As the ever-diligent
scholar, I waited until the
night before the due date to
comment on a classmate's
author. As I scrolled through

the offerings, my only inten-
tion was to find a short
poem upon which to com-
ment. Woman plans and God
laughs. "A Japanese Fan" is
many things. Short is not one
of them. But from its light
and playful opening stanza, I
was hooked.
Some eleven stanzas later, I
became thoroughly convinced
that part of my purpose on
this earth is to get people to
read this poem. I could speak
about the poem's expression
of the complex interactions
of consumerism, imperialism
and Victorian gender roles,
but to dust off an old saying,
ain't nobody got time for that.
I'll only say that I think "A
Japanese Fan" inspires the
reader to create a further
narration, which I consider to
be a mark of a great work.
Then, of course, you can
stumble upon a verse in the
vast wilderness known as
social media. That's how
I found my current obses-
sion, e.e. cummings, and
specifically his poem "i love
you much (most beautiful
darling)." If you've ever been
on the Quotes page of Pinter-
est, you know it is an absolute
minefield of misattributed
quotes ("No, Oscar Wilde
did not say that.") and weird
advice for how to be a Chris-
tian wife ("Okay..."). If, how-
ever, you persevere, you can
find some great stuff, like the
aforementioned poem.
Cummings' style, known
for its unusual form, gram-
mar and punctuation, give all
his works a distinct flavor,
and it's no different in "I
love you much (most beauti-
ful darling)." What's really
impressive is how cummings
manages to convey such a
depth of feeling while keep-
ing the tone light and airy
throughout. It's an achieve-
ment that would make even

the most hardened cynic take
another chance on love.
Of course, there are also
somewhat embarrassing ways
to find new poems. How
could such a neutral activity
ever be embarrassing, you
ask? Oh, dear reader, don't
ever doubt my ability on that
account.
I was seventeen and pining
hopelessly over a friend of a
friend. He had great hair and
was in a band, making him, in
my teenage mind, the catch of
the century.
Instead of, I don't know,
talking to him, I decided a
much better approach would
be to read everything I could
about his favorite author, in a
bid to better understand his
true psyche. Why yes, I am
wildly fun at parties.
Now the writer I was sup-
posed to be studying up on
was Chuck Palahniuk, but
in my infinite wisdom I for-
got the name and could only
remember it started with a
"C" and had a "K" towards
the end. Thus, I ended up at
Charles Bukowski.
Bukowski's intense, auto-
biographical style of writing
demands a certain amount
of attention, and thus by the
time I figured out my mis-
take, I was too engrossed,
specifically with his famous
"An Almost Made Up Poem,"
to continue my scheme.
The crush fizzled, but
Bukowski and I are still going
strong. Poetry is forever.
And with that, I leave you
to blindly stumble upon your
own favorite poems. In writ-
ing this column I myself hap-
pened upon some intriguing
works by Charles Baudelaire,
and well, suffice it to say it's
going to be a late night.

Cave regularly vacillates from genre to genre in its composition.

'U' alum talks
experience writing
for TV, The Onion
By ERIKA HARWOOD
Senior Arts Editor
Despite the University's
best efforts, life for students
post-graduation doesn't always
mean immediate job offers and
stable careers. This is espe-
cially true for those who dream
of pursuing a life in the enter-
tainment industry. For aspir-
ing writers and comedians, the
years after college are usually
a healthy combination of strug-
gling to break into the business
and working the oddest of odd
jobs. It's become part of the pil-
grimage; you study, you work,
you create and maybe you break
through. It's an uncertain life-
style that can drive away even
the most dedicated - but there
are always exceptions.
University alum Megan Ganz
knew she wanted to go into
comedy since she was a teen-
ager flipping through copies of
Mad Magazine and The Onion.
Once in Ann Arbor, Ganz wast-
ed little time pursuing that
goal. She earned the position
of editor-in-chief at The Every
Three Weekly and scored an
internship at Mad Magazine in
New York.
"My mom bought me my
first Onion book, and I started
by wanting to write for The
Onion. Once I got to U of M,
I started taking English Lit-
erature classes - I was con-
sidering maybe being a teacher
- but I decided I wanted to do
comedy full time," Ganz said.
Her internship at Mad pro-
vided first-hand experience
with professional comedy writ-
ing, and gave her one of her
first big breaks in the industry.
"(The) first thing I ever
sold was a fold-in idea at Mad
I just pitched something
in a meeting and they liked
it and they went with it," she
explained. "That was the first
real money I ever made writ-
ing comedy, and that was a big
moment."
But it wasn't the last. After
Ganz graduated in 2006, she
began working at her other
dream job, The Onion. Despite

approach,
resulting in its strongest episode
so far.
Centering on the title district,
"Arkham"delves into the rising
conflict between the city's two
crime bosses, Carmine Falcone
(John Doman,"The Wire") and

ter"), as they fight for control of

Kazim, "Black Sails"), a hitman

her age and limited level of
experience, she felt prepared
to start her comedy career at a
publication most writers would
consider the summit of the
comedy climb.
"I loved The Onion, so when
I went to school I started writ-
ing for something that was
like The Onion and that made
me learn that form," Ganz
explained. "Then when I went
and worked at that job, I knew
that form really well."
Ganz pitched and wrote
satirical pieces on a variety of
topics - similar to the work she
had been doing at The Every
Three Weekly. Riffing off of
real news headlines, Ganz
proved her talent for joke writ-
ing and storytelling, eventually
becoming an editor at the pub-
lication.
"There's not any formal
training that you really need
in order to do (comedy) ... I
had to start writing all the
time. And I had done a couple
of those internships, so yeah,
I felt prepared to start," Ganz
said. "I kept getting offered
jobs though. So that was a good
sign."
After a few years with The
Onion, Ganz made the leap to
television writing - first with
a brief stint at Comedy Cen-
tral's "Important Things with
Demetri Martin" then moving
on to NBC's "Community" and
to her current job at "Modern
Family" on ABC. This breadth
of experiences has allowed
Ganz to flex different comedic
muscles, and have helped her
to develop a range of skills to
apply to her writing - both in
her current work and in future
projects.
"'Community' exercised a
little bit more of my experi-
;mental side, but 'Modern Fam-
ily' is great because you have
to have humans talk they way
they really talk and people
engage with each other like
they really do," she said. "Not
because the story dictates that
they do it that way, but because
that's how actual people would
talk to each other. If I ever go
forward and write something
of my own I'll definitely bring
what I've learned from both
shows to the table."
As for what she plans to do
after "Modern Family," it's still

up in the air. Ganz has been
working on a movie script with
a writing partner who also
works in television, and then
there's talk of her potentially
writing an animated show for
FX, but nothing is set in stone.
There is one thing Ganz is sure
of though.
"I like TV. I think I'd want to
stick with TV. The thing about
movies is you're putting in a lot
of time for a long time before
you kind of know where any-
thing is going. You can work on
something for a few years and
then it can just go away," she
said. "Whereas television, the
nice thing about it is you write
something and the network
decides to make it or not - like,
pretty quickly. I like that it just
feels like a regular job."
That is, a regular job where
you work alongside veteran
television writers who have
been in the business for decades
and worked on shows like
"Cheers," "Frasier" and "Sex
and the City." With a writing
room full of resumes boasting
awards and years of experi-
ence, a day at work seems like
a daunting task, but Ganz says
she's constantly learning.
"When you're doing com-
edy, it's an interesting business
because obviously some days
you just wake up not feeling
funny," she said. "And so I'm
learning how to be professional
and be able to work consistent-
ly every day."
With a job that demands
writers to be on their A-game
every day, the ability to deliver
material with consistency is a
necessity, and a skill Ganz has
gained through experience.
"You just push through it."
she said. "I think your ego takes
over at some point and you feel
like, 'Oh, I don't just want to sit
in a room and be quiet all day.'
So you pitch stuff even if you
don't feel like it."
Sometimes the off days result
in the best work - as Ganz has
experienced firsthand - and
offer one of the best lessons for
aspiring writers and comedi-
ans.
"Honestly, some of the jokes
I've gotten into shows have
been during days when I really
didn't want to be there or do
this," she added. "But that's
why you keep pitching."

TRAILER REVIEW

is a far subtler figure than pre-
vious villains-of-the-week,
increasinghis menace. Along
with Falcone and Maroni, the
stories centered on the other
criminals of"Gotham" prove to
be the episode's strength. Oswald
Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor,
"The Walking Dead") plans to
rise among the ranks of Gotham's
underground are multilayered,
manipulating Maroni while feed-
ing Gordon information, and will
hopefully lead to bigger payoffs
as the future Penguin balances

his deceptions. The criminals'
plots are miles more engrossing
than Gordon's clunky relationship
issues that hold back "Arkham."
The hollow victory for Gor-
don at the end ofthe episode
reveals that the uphill battle to
save Gotham is beyond solving a
single case. The compromise on
Arkham's future, to appease both
Falcone and Maroni, reinforces
the fact that the two criminals
control Gotham,not the scared-
for-his-life mayor.

"The Book of Life" opens

Dia de los Muertos, or the Day
of the Dead,
with two
best friends The Book
competing
for the love of Life
of one beauti- 20th Century Fox
ful woman.
The computer
animation recalls the famous
prints of Mexican artist Jose
Guadalupe Posada, whose
satirical depictions of Mexican
bourgeoisie as decadent skel-
etons have been associated with
the aforementioned Mexican
holiday.
Two spirits (one good and
the other evil) strike a bet con-
cerning the outcome of the two
best friends' competition, and
the one evil spirit proceeds to
cheat - as evil spirits are prone

to. What might be problematic
for the film is how it appro-
priates Mexican and Latin@
culture for the purposes of the
American cultural-consumerist
event of Halloween.
In the trailer, at the first
mention of "Day of the Dead,"
the words "This Halloween"
appear on screen. This begs
the question: Does the film cel-
ebrate the Day of the Dead as a
legitimate cultural event in its

own right, or does the film dis-
respect this Mexican holiday by
subordinating it to the celebra-
tion of American Halloween? (I
suspect the latter.) To answer
these questions more definitive-
ly, one would of course, have to
see the film, which, just based
on the trailer, I wouldn't recom-
mend unless these questions of
possible cultural misappropria-
tions compel you otherwise.
