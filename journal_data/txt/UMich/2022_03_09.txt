ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

UMich community gathers on the Diag to show 

support for Ukraine amid Russian invasion

Local leaders join rally welcoming refugees, advocating for greater sanctions on Putin

Dozens of signs with messages 

such Dozens of signs with messages 
such as “We Stand With Ukraine” 
and “No War” could be spotted 
alongside the yellow and blue hues 
of Ukraine’s flag on the University 
of Michigan Diag, where over a 
hundred people gathered Saturday 
afternoon to show support for 
Ukraine and its people amid an 
ongoing invasion by the Russian 
military.

The “Stand with Ukraine” vigil 

and rally featured six speakers, 
including U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., and Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor. In between 
remarks, 
the 
crowd 
recited 

chants such as “ ,” a 
Ukrainian national salute meaning 
“Glory to Ukraine.”

Social Work lecturer Carrie 

Rheingans opened by thanking 
attendees and calling for a moment 
of silence to honor the lives lost in 
the ongoing invasion. 

Dingell said she wants to see 

the United States impose strong 
sanctions 
against 
Russia 
and 

condemned those in the U.S. who 
have expressed support for Russian 
President Vladimir Putin in the 
wake of the attack.

“I do believe we need to take 

stronger sanctions,” Dingell said. 
“I want us to do everything we 
can to help the people of Ukraine 
right now, but if the situation 
escalates, the president must seek 
congressional approval pursuant 

to the War Powers Resolution 
before any U.S. troops deploy into 
areas of situation where there is 
an imminent risk of hostilities.”

Dingell went on to praise 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky 
for 
his 
leadership 

despite being “Putin’s number-
one enemy.”

“(Zelensky) is a hero,” Dingell 

said. “He is an example of those 
that believe in their countries 

… and (are) fighting for the 
people that (they) represent. His 
leadership is giving strength to so 
many in Ukraine.”

Mayor Taylor followed by 

saying Ann Arbor will welcome 
any and all Ukrainian refugees 
just as it welcomes migrants from 
a myriad of backgrounds.

“Just as we regularly welcome 

immigrants and refugees from all 
corners of the globe in the weeks 

to come, we particularly welcome 
the immigrants and refugees 
from Ukraine who make it to our 
corner of the world,” Taylor said. 
“They will have a home here, 
honored and always.”

One attendee held a sign 

reading “Russians are against war 
in Ukraine.” Over the past few 
days, thousands have gathered 
across multiple Russian cities to 
protest the invasion, resulting 

in the arrests of hundreds of 
demonstrators.

Rackham 
student 
Egor 

Korneev, who is Russian, said 
he attended the event to show 
support for the people of Ukraine, 
adding 
that 
many 
Russian 

citizens are afraid to act publicly 
for fear of retribution by the 
Russian government.

The Michigan Daily sat down with 

Interim University President Mary Sue 
Coleman on Wednesday morning for 
 
presidential search, the controversy with 

Mary Sue Coleman: Before we 

get started, I thought I’d just tell you 
about several things that have been 
really on the top of my mind. I want 
to make sure the University continues 
with carbon neutrality because those 
efforts are really important to me. 
I was really happy with the regents 
meeting at the Geothermal Facility 
up on North Campus — that’s really a 
groundbreaking way for us to achieve 
Carbon Neutrality. And I’m excited 
about that and looking forward 
to it, and then we’re getting these 
electric buses. One of the things I’ve 
heard from students was this worry 
about food insecurity, and so we’ve 
put forward $20,000 into the bulk 
pantries on the North Campus. The 
third thing is Spring Break coming up, 
and I know some people are staying, 
some people are going, and I just 
encourage everybody to take a COVID 
test before you leave and a COVID test 
after you get back. I know people will 
be responsible.

The Michigan Daily: What is it like 

being back at Michigan? 

MSC: I love the University. I had 

some of the best years of my life here 
from 2002 to 2014; even though the 
circumstances were sad when I came 
back, when the regents called me, I 
thought ‘Oh, well my life is going to be 
sort of upended.’ But quickly, I shed all 
the responsibilities that my husband 
and I had and came back. 

It’s a different time — eight years 

is quite a long time, and a lot has 

happened in the world and in the 
community …. What I worry about 
is mistrust, and I think we have to 
rebuild trust and confidence. I’m glad 
that people are speaking out now 
about harm and so that’s been a big 
positive for me, because I don’t think 
you can really address harm unless 
you’re willing to talk about it. So many 
things are the same, some things are 
different, but the University is just 
doing so many exciting things that I 
sort of revel in learning more about 
those.

TMD: Looking back into your 

tenure, what would you have done 
differently?

MSC: The times are so different, 

and I think you have to adjust your 
actions and your expectations to the 
times, and so everything changes. I 
think we know more now about things 
that created harm for people. And 

so we look at things differently now. 
But for me, change has been positive 
because we evolve, and we get better at 
what we do. We hope and we try.

TMD: As interim president, what 

role do you have in the Presidential 
Search Committee and what qualities 
are you looking for in a good University 
president?

MSC: I have no official role on the 

Committee. The most important job 
of the Board of Regents is that they 
pick the president of the University, 
and I am really pleased with the 
approach that Regents Denise Ilitch 
and Sarah Hubbard are taking. Having 
these listening sessions on campus is 
essential because they need this input 
to get information about what people 
are looking for in the future president, 
and I think they’re hearing a lot. 

What I’ve said to the Board of 

Regents is if they wish for any advice 

from me, or if they want to talk to 
me, I’m always available to them, but 
I don’t have any official role. I think 
their goal, which I’m very pleased 
about, is that they are hoping to have 
this process completed by early to 
midsummer. I’ve told the Board that 
if they wish, I would be very happy to 
help with the transition, but it’s really 
their call, not mine. 

TMD: On Jan. 19, 2022, the 

University announced it had reached a 
$490 million settlement with survivors 
of the late Dr. Robert Anderson. It 
was widely reported that part of the 
settlement was Jon Vaughn stopping 
his protest in front of the President’s 
house provision in the settlement? 
Can you confirm if these reports were 
accurate? If so, do you support this 
provision in the settlement?

Rackham 

Graduate School to 
discontinue GRE 

test requirement for 
all Ph.D. programs

U.S. Department 

of Education 
announces 

distribution of 
ARP funds in 

higher education

Dean Mike Solomon said 

standardized exams no longer needed 

to encourage holistic applications

Over $64 million allocated 
for University of Michigan, 
financial relief for students

The 
Graduate 
Record 

Examination 
(GRE) 
will 

no longer be required for 
Rackham Ph.D. candidates, 
the school’s Executive Board 
announced Wednesday. The 
GRE is a standardized test 
graduate school applicants 
are often required to take, 
similar to the SAT or ACT for 
undergraduate admissions. 
The announcement said the 
Board made this decision 
using input from Ph.D. 
departments and faculty. 

Rackham 
Dean 
Mike 

Solomon 
wrote 
in 
the 

announcement 
that 
this 

decision was made in hopes 
of making the graduate 
admissions 
process 

more holistic for future 
applications.

“By leaving these scores 

behind, the rich information 
of the doctoral application 
can be reviewed in ways 
that are truly holistic and 
responsive to the broad 
demographics 
of 
our 

applicants,” Solomon wrote.

On the Frequently Asked 

Questions page, Rackham 
said removing the GRE 
requirement will make the 
application process more 
equitable. The FAQ also 
said the school did not find 
indications that the GRE 
is indicative of success in 
graduate school, citing a 

presentation from Fall 2021.

According to a virtual 

survey conducted by the 
Rackham Executive Board 
 

, over 90% of the responses 
favored lifting the testing 
requirement. The school 
will provide support and 
consultation 
throughout 

the process of changing 
the 
admissions 
criteria 

for 
all 
Ph.D. 
programs 

over the next three years. 
Those programs with high 
application numbers will 
receive compensation and 
additional resources, such 
as consultation teams, to 
support the transition.

In an interview to The 

Michigan Daily, Solomon 
said removing the GRE 
requirement is critical in 
creating a more equitable 
space in academics.

“A doctoral degree is 

critical to higher education,” 
Solomon 
said. 
“It’s 
a 

pathway to faculty positions 
in colleges and universities. 
This training leads to all 
sorts of careers — in (higher 
education), government and 
nonprofits. What Rackham 
has announced is really 
designed to increase access 
to the Ph.D. education, to 
reduce barriers to applying 
and 
succeeding 
in 
the 

degree. Discontinuing the 
use of the GRE removes a 
barrier (to education).”

The U.S. Department 

of Education announced 
the detailed state-by-
state spread of the 
American Rescue Plan 
(ARP) — which was 
approved 
just 
under 

a year ago on March 
11, 2021 — funding 
in a press release on 
Monday. 
The 
press 

release was followed 
by a press conference 
focused predominantly 
on 
the 
Higher 

Education Emergency 
Relief Fund (HEERF 
II), which focuses on 
funds for colleges and 
universities as part of 
the American Rescue 
Plan. 

The state of Michigan 

received over $1 billion 
in funding for the state’s 
colleges and universities. 
Under 
the 
plan, 
the 

University of Michigan 
will receive $64,724,747. 
Michigan State University 
will receive $81,753,998, 
and community colleges 

in the state will receive 
$303 million.

During Monday’s press 

conference, U.S. Secretary 
of 
Education 
Miguel 

Cardona responded to 
inquiries on the oversight 
for the U.S. DOE to ensure 
relief funds are properly 
distributed by universities. 

“(It’s 
important) 

that 
we’re 
also 

communicating 
with 

colleges, with districts, 
with states on how the 
money is being used,” 
Cardona said. “There are 
reporting features. It’s 
important for us to know, 
but it’s more important 
for you to know. So it’s 
really important in our 
messaging 
to 
them 

that they make this 
information public.”

The release declared 

that the ARP requires 
half of the funding to be 
used for direct financial 
relief for students, and 
the DOE expects more 
will be allocated for this 
purpose.

“Killing other people never brings 

peace, and that’s why I try to support 
Ukrainians,” Korneev said. “I really 
hope that the war will end as soon as 
possible. Ukrainians have the right 
to live as they want … Many Russians 
are really afraid of (publicly opposing 
the war), but many of us share the 
view that peace should be brought to 
Ukraine.”

Taylor also acknowledged the 

presence of Russian members of the 

Ann Arbor community and their 

support for Ukraine.

“It’s important that we acknowledge 

and support Ann Arborites who are 
from Russia,” Taylor said. “You are 
not to blame for this … Thank you for 
standing up for what is right. Thank 
you for helping and standing up to 
support the people of Ukraine.”

U-M alum Natalia Kujan Gentry, 

Ukrainian-American attorney and 
former president of the University’s 
Ukrainian Students’ Club, spoke about 
the cultural suppression Ukraine 
faced under Russian occupation 
and shared stories from her family 
that narrated life under Soviet rule. 
She emphasized the importance 
of combating misinformation with 

storytelling.

“These are the stories that we 

must tell,” Gentry said. “We must 
grab a hold of the narrative, and we 
must control (it). Our only weapon 
against misinformation is anecdotal 
storytelling.”

Mykola Murskyj, chairman of the 

Ukrainian-American Crisis Response 
Committee of Michigan, said he 
was concerned about his friends and 
family and Ukrainian statehood, but 
said he had faith Ukraine would come 
out victorious.

“But I know for a fact that Vladimir 

Putin cannot win,” Murskyj said. 
“The insurgency that he will face will 
be bloody, it’ll be the worst in history. 

There is no way that the Russian 
leadership can continue to oppress 
the Ukrainian people. There’s no 
way that Vladimir Putin’s gonna 
win. It’s not gonna happen.”

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Vlada 

Zviagina, who is Ukrainian, spoke 
to the crowd about how Ann 
Arbor residents could help support 
Ukrainian citizens, such as donating 
to trusted humanitarian funds. 

“(There are) at least three things 

that you can do: sign petitions, call 
your elected officials and donate to 
the cause,” Zviagina said.

LSA 
professor 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck 
introduced 
Jonathan 

Vaughn, a former University of 

Michigan football player and sexual 

assault survivor, at the beginning of 

a celebration commemorating 100 

days of protest organized by faculty to 

show support of the survivors of the 

late former University doctor Robert 

Anderson. The event was planned 

by Art & Design Professor Rebekah 

Modrak. The School of Art & Design 

partially funded the commemoration.

Speaking at the University of 

Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) 

Wednesday night, Weineck and LSA 

professor Allison Alexy granted 

Vaughn an honorary “Bachelor of 

Justice” degree, conferred to him on 

behalf of 302 faculty, and an unofficial 

honorary diploma commemorating 

his work on behalf of the survivors.

“It is my great joy to present you 

with the People’s degree,” Weineck 

said. “Hereby it is certified that 

upon recommendation of the rules 

of decency, the undersigned faculty 

of 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

have 
conferred 
upon 
Jonathan 

Stewart 
Vaughn, 
in 
recognition 

of his unflinching courage, public 

leadership and dedication to the cause 

of the institution’s integrity, the degree 

of honorary Bachelor of Justice.” 

Applause from a standing ovation 

filled the room as Vaughn accepted 

his degree, along with a black felt 

graduation cap and trophy. He tried to 

speak but was overcome by tears and 

emotion. Fellow Anderson survivor 

Chuck Christian comforted Vaughn 

with a pat on the back. 

When Vaughn was able to speak, 

he began by thanking his mother, 

family, colleagues and supporters for 

helping to make the protest a success. 

He followed with critiques of the 

University’s leadership and their 

handling of Dr. Anderson’s abuse. 

“Nothing has changed in this toxic 

culture,” Vaughn said. “Ex-president 

Schlissel just got caught, and Mary 

Sue Coleman knows where all the 

bodies are buried. We will not let that 

stand.”

He 
continued 
to 
condemn 

other members of the University 

administration, including the Board of 

Regents, for their “persistent silence” 

on abuse scandals in the University 

community. Vaughn called out each 

regent by name for their failure to 

meet with him individually to discuss 

systematic change on campus.

“Your constructive knowledge, 

functional blindness and incredible 

guilt needs no introduction,” Vaughn 

said. “I will not be the scapegoat. You 

need to prove that you are serious and 

committed to not allowing this type of 

atrocity to ever happen again.” 

Vaughn also called for the removal 

of the Bo Schembechler statue and 

renaming of Schembechler Hall. 

Others in the community have also 

called for removal of the statue; last 

November, 
an 
anonymous 
local 

resident splattered red paint over the 

statue. Vaughn told The Michigan 

Daily last semester that the act was not 

associated with his protest.

Vaughn said he is willing to testify 

before Congress like the survivors 

of Larry Nassar, a former Michigan 

State University gymnastics coach. 

He then requested a meeting with 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Lt. Gov. 

Garlin Gilchrist to discuss the legacy 

of Anderson and his abuse at the 

University. Vaughn ended his speech 

by stressing the importance of the 

unification and empowerment of 

sexual abuse survivors everywhere. 

“We are sons and daughters, fathers 

and mothers, brothers and sisters,” 

Vaughn said. “We are teammates. We 

are citizens in your districts (and) in 

your states. But most importantly, we 

are all survivors of something. We 

stand together as victorious victims. 

And whether they speak it or not, none 

of my brothers or sisters are John or 

Jane Doe. I will never be John Doe, I 

will always be Jon Vaughn.”

Daily Staff Reporter

Throughout the month of February, 

the University of Michigan and the 

Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs Office 

(MESA) organized events to celebrate 

Black History Month (BHM) and 

the 50th anniversary of the Trotter 

Multicultural Center and MESA. The 

BHM Planning Committee decided on 

the theme BLACK JOY! with events 

ranging from a celebratory round table on 

singer Eileen Southern and the music of 

Black Americans to a dance workshop for 

ballroom dancing.

MESA and the BHM Planning 

Committee organized a closing ceremony 

for the month, which included dance 

ensemble performances, vocal music 

numbers and a keynote presentation 

by Robin Wilson, associate professor 

of dance and associate professor in the 

department of african american studies. 

LSA senior Kori Tucker, a member of 

the BHM Planning Committee member, 

began the ceremony by welcoming guests 

and explained why the planning 

committee chose “BLACK JOY!” as 

the theme for this year’s Black History 

Month.

“Throughout this month, we have 

made it a mission to celebrate ourselves,” 

Tucker said. “We realized that Black 

people experienced many hardships, 

therefore we didn’t want to focus on 

that. As the planning committee was 

brainstorming ideas for what this year’s 

Black History Month theme should be, 

we decided that this campus in particular 

was overdue for a celebration of our joy, 

which is how we came up with BLACK 

JOY!.”

Business 
junior 
Omar 

Elrashid,another 
member 
of 
the 

committee, spoke about the priorities for 

the celebration of “BLACK JOY!”

MSC: That was never an official 

part of the Anderson settlement, as 
far as I’m told. I wasn’t part of the 
Anderson settlement, that was a 
confidential mediation, but I don’t 
think that was a real condition. 
However, I thought doing the 
settlement was the right thing to do. 
I’m glad that the University did it. 
It’s going to take a while to get it all 
through the process because when 
you’re talking about a large number of 
people who were involved and a large 
amount of money, it will take time. 
We’ll work through all that, but we are 
where we are.

TMD: What are your thoughts 

on Jon Vaughn announcing he is 
continuing his protest past his original 
plan of 100 days? Do you plan on 
speaking with Jon Vaughn during your 
term as interim president?

MSC: Everybody has to decide 

what they want to do, and I think the 
settlement was the right thing to do. I 
think we now have a responsibility to 
help with healing, and so I wish Jon 
Vaughn the best. 

TMD: The WilmerHale report 

regarding 
sexual 
misconduct 

allegations against former Provost 
Martin Philbert says you were made 
aware of allegations against Philbert 
but didn’t remember receiving them. 
The report states if you had received 
them, you and others “likely would 
not have given (them) the same weight 
in 2010 as they would today.” Can you 
clarify what you meant by this and how 
would you have handled this situation 
today? 

MSC: I’ve learned a lot since that 

happened, and part of my learning 
was being president of the Association 
of American Universities where we 
conducted the largest survey on sexual 
misconduct on university campuses 
that has ever been done. The first one 
was 150,000 respondents, the second 
one was 200,000 respondents, and 
they were undergraduate students 
surveys, but there was some indication 
within those surveys about faculty 
misconduct and staff misconduct. So 
our understanding really expanded. 

There are two things that have 

happened that I think have been very 

positive. First of all, victims are more 
willing to come forward. I think the 
#metoo movement has been very 
positive in that regard. And I frankly 
learned a lot more about the prevalence 
of misconduct. At that time, the reports 
that we got about Martin Philbert 
were anonymous, and we tried to 
investigate, but nobody would speak. 
Nobody would come forward because 
I think people were afraid. So now, I 
think they would come forward, and I 
think that’s a good thing. So that’s what 
I meant by that comment. I learned a 
lot and I think society learned a lot.

TMD: What are your thoughts 

on the new and revamped Office 
of Equity, Civil Rights and Title 
IX (ECRT), formerly the Office of 
Institutional Equity? 

MSC: I had the pleasure of seeing 

Tami Strickman and her team. They 
made a nice presentation at the Board 
of Regents meeting about the plans for 
the office and what they’re going to 
do, so I was very impressed with the 
team and Tami in particular. I think 
the plans they have for the office are 
extremely good. They want to do a lot 
of education. They want to provide 
services to the departments. They 
want to streamline investigations. 
They want to do all the things that we 
heard from the community that would 
be helpful in restoring trust, changing 
the culture and really getting us to 
the point where these incidents don’t 
happen. Or if they do happen, they are 
few and far between. I think this is a 
very positive step for the University. 
Though, eyes wide open, we have a 
cultural journey. We’ve got to change 
the culture, and that’s going to take 
time. We started with the survey that 
was done last week about “What are 
people thinking now?” I think that 
office will be very, very helpful to the 
community and I’m looking forward 
to it.

TMD: Current ECRT Director 

Tamiko Strickman is currently facing 
two lawsuits for mishandling cases 
of sexual misconduct and racial 
discrimination 
at 
the 
University 

of Nebraska-Lincoln. Do you have 
confidence in her ability to run this 
office based on these allegations?

MSC: I do. I absolutely have 

tremendous confidence in her. She is a 
very impressive woman. 

TMD: With the Omicron variant 

subsiding both on campus and across 
the country, Washtenaw County 
removed its mask mandate for 
K-12 education and other Big Ten 
universities, such as the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison, have also 
announced plans to phase out indoor 
mask mandates. Does the University 
have any plans to lift its mask mandate 
in the foreseeable future? 

MSC: I think what we’re focused 

on now is what we’re going to do in the 
fall, and a lot will depend on (scientific) 
evidence. We have a very, very 
excellent committee working on this 
headed up by our head of University 
Health Service, and they’re meeting 
weekly. They meet several times a 
week to look at case counts, illness and 
what’s happening in our community. 

What’s important to realize is 

that every community is different. 
What phase Washtenaw County’s 
community is in is different from our 
own University community. And so 
what we want to do is to make sure 
that we listen carefully to the evidence 
that (the committee) comes forward 
with. We don’t have any plans at this 
moment to lift the mask policy.

TMD: After Sunday’s situation 

with Juwan Howard, what were your 
conversations like with Wisconsin’s 
chancellor and Warde Manuel? What 
is your opinion on Juwan Howard’s 
actions?

MSC: Let me set the scene for 

you: My husband and I were at the 
women’s basketball game, and it was 
a tough game against Maryland and 
oh boy, we were sitting down close. 
One of the things when you’re sitting 
down close in a basketball game, you 
really see how physical the game is 
and, oh my gosh, it was an amazing, 
amazing game. But during the game, 
I got this video that was handed to 
me, and I saw the incident from the 
Wisconsin game. Immediately, I got 
up and went up and spoke with Warde. 
He immediately got on the situation. 
I called Chancellor Blank at the 
University of Wisconsin to apologize 
on behalf of the institution because 
I thought it was very important. It’s 
never acceptable, I don’t care what 
happens, it’s never acceptable to throw 
a punch. On the other hand, I was so 
impressed with Coach Howard and 
how he came forward with a very — I 
thought — sincere apology. He’s been 

suspended for the rest of the season, 
and it was appropriate. What was 
done by the Big Ten and by our 
own athletic department was the 
appropriate remedy here. I was 
proud of everybody in this situation, 
as well as Coach Howard, because I 
thought he did the right thing by 
apologizing. It’s what is expected of 
Michigan. You can make mistakes, 
nobody’s perfect, but then you can 
do the right thing after you make 
that mistake and I think he did.

TMD: With Provost Susan 

Collins stepping down in May 2022, 
who are you considering as interim 
provost? Do you have any idea on 
who the permanent provost will be? 

MSC: Yes, Provost Collins will 

be leaving May 15 and going to a 
very exciting job. I was so proud of 
her. I’ve been in conversation with 
an interim provost. I can’t reveal the 
name right now because we’re still in 
discussion. But that announcement 
will be made at the March board 
meeting. 

That position will take a year to 

be filled because what we need to 
do is to give the new president time 
to come in and sort of get the lay of 
the land. The permanent provost 
will be picked by the next president 
because the relationship between 
the president and the provost is 
really important, and that person is 
critical to the efficient and effective 
running of the University. 

 
I’m thrilled with the interim 

that we’re going to be announcing 
and just really so grateful to Susan 
Collins because she stepped in at a 
time of need for the University and 
has served admirably as provost for 
the last couple of years. 

TMD: Will the interim provost 

be an internal or external hire? 

MSC: You can’t do an external 

search in the few weeks that I’ve had, 
so you can assume that it’s internal. 
If it were external, we would have 
had to do an announcement, and 
we’d have to have a big search 
committee. I did shut down the 
search for the permanent provost, 
and we disbanded the committee. I 
talked to the committee so that they 
understood why I didn’t want them 
to go through all that work because I 
thought we needed a good solution 
for the next year. We really want 

to give maximum flexibility to the 
new president, and this does that, so 
I’m very happy with the outcome, but 
we’re still in the negotiation process.

TMD: I know you mentioned 

this briefly in your introduction, 
but what are your thoughts on 
the 
recommendations 
from 
the 

Presidential 
Commission 
on 

Carbon 
Neutrality? 
Are 
these 

recommendations a priority when 
looking for a future president?

MSC: Absolutely. The commitment 

of carbon neutrality is a University 
commitment. It’s not my commitment, 
it’s not a personal commitment 
from the President, it is a University 
commitment. 

Let me give a little bit about my 

background. My husband and I put 
solar panels on our house here, even 
though there’s not that much sun, just 
because we believe in it. We have an 
electric car because we believe that we 
have to personally reduce our carbon 
footprint. So I was so happy when I 
came and saw those recommendations 
from the committee and the fact 
that the University has has already 
begun to act on them. We’re going to 
build the Geothermal Facility up on 
North Campus, which I think will be 
groundbreaking. It’s really wonderful. 
The fact that we’re going out and getting 
the electric buses right away, and we’re 
trying to think about electrifying the 
fleet — all that’s going to take time. 
We’ve put about $5 million into trying 
to have LED bulbs across campus to 
reduce that energy use. There are all 
these things that we can do, and I hope 
that students will see what they can do 
to reduce their carbon footprint. We’re 
all part of this, and we all have to make 
an effort. I can’t imagine a president 
coming in not committing to carbon 
neutrality because this is such a high-
profile program for the institution. 
I’m assuming the search committee 
will probe that question. This has 
been happening at universities all 
over the country, so yes, I know that 
commitment to carbon neutrality will 
probably be there. That will be one of 
the factors that the Presidential Search 
Committee will question candidates 
about.

TMD: Could you speak more on 

other current initiatives from the 
recommendations that are in action 
right now?

MSC: We have a whole list. We just 

issued some bonds and $300 million of 
those bonds are going to be for green 
investments. We’re putting our money 
where our mouth is, and we really want 
to promote those efforts. I know the 
University is in discussion right now 
about a big solar farm and expanding 
that to renewable power agreements 
through DTE. We want to make sure 
what we’re sourcing through the energy 
companies is as green as it can possibly 
be. There are multiple initiatives going 
on across the institution, and in the next 
year or so, students will see more of that 
rolling out.

TMD: We always like to end these 

interviews with a fun, light-hearted 
question, so what’s the one thing on 
campus that you’ve missed the most? 

MSC: Oh, the students. During my 

tenure as university president before 
2014, we had these Fireside Chats; 
E. Royster Harper, who was the vice 
president for student life at the time, and 
I would do these together. Her office 
would invite students to come, so the 
students who came had an invitation, 
and we would normally invite students 
who were upset about something and 
had something to complain about 
because we thought, ‘come on in and 
talk,’ and so we had these over in the 
Union. They were usually four o’clock 
in the afternoon, and we’d have cookies 
and punch. At the end of the day, I 
would always think, ‘Oh, I’m so tired. 
I’m going to go to this session,’ but it was 
so much fun and so interesting that at 
five o’clock, when that session was over, 
I was completely re-energized again 
because it was just fun. Those sessions, 
even though people maybe had a 
complaint or something was wrong, we 
always had really good and interesting 
discussions. They weren’t complaint 
sessions at all, and they didn’t end up 
that way at all. I learned a lot about 
student life and what students were 
experiencing and how they felt about 
Michigan. 

One of the things that always just 

astonished me about the University 
is how students get connected to the 
place and how they love the place. It 
was very inspiring. So I missed that the 
most.

The descendants of late 

artist Lo Chia-Lun donated 
a Chinese calligraphy collec-
tion valued at over $12 million 
to the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art in January 
2022, making it the largest art 
donation in the museum’s his-
tory.

The collection is composed 

of works created by colleagues 
of Lo Chia-Lun, a leader of 
China’s May Fourth Move-
ment — an anti-imperialist 

movement that started after 
student protests in Beijing 
in May 1919 — including Cai 
Yuanpei, Chen Duxiu and Shen 
Yinmo. Works by other artists 
and cultural figures such as Xu 
Beihong and Zhang Daqian are 
also included in the collection. 
The collection includes a total 
of 72 pieces, with art from the 
Yuan, Ming and Qing dynas-
ties, spanning from the years 
1271 to 1911. 

Assistant professor of Chi-

nese arts and cultures Lihong 
Liu explained in an email to 
The Michigan Daily the sig-
nificance of calligraphy in 

Chinese culture throughout 
history. The art form can be 
traced back to the Eastern Han 
period — 25-220 C.E. — when 
people began to create treatis-
es on calligraphy. 

“It was this time the so-

called ‘cursive script’ (caoshu) 
became popular, marking a 
highly personal expression in 
calligraphy, with an unimped-
ed flow of energy across the 
linear 
movement 
instigated 

not only by the body, but also 
by an inner urge,” Liu wrote.

Over 1,300 University of Michi-

gan community members attend-
ed the annual TEDxUofM event 
Friday at the Power Center for 
Performing Arts with the theme 
SHATTERPROOF. Eight speak-
ers from across the University of 
Michigan community presented 
10-15 minute talks on topics relat-
ed to resilience and withstanding 
adversity. In addition to the talks, 

the event included musical perfor-
mances from Gmen and Groove, 
two music student groups on 
campus. 

Returning to an in-person 

event this year, TEDxUofM is a 
student-run initiative inspired 
by TED, but independently 
organized by U-M students. 
Throughout the event, Univer-
sity-affiliated 
presentations, 

performances and speakers 
discuss ideas across different 
disciplines, while all connect-
ing to a specific theme. The 
conference first launched in 
Ann Arbor in 2010, and has 
occurred annually since. 

LSA senior Amala Nayak, 

one of the co-directors of the 
event, told The Michigan Daily 
that organizing this event was 
gratifying because the process 
was very collaborative.

“It’s so rewarding to know 

that you are creating an event 
that people really care about 
and are excited to go to,” Nayak 
said. “I just love how dedicated 
our team is … I think we’ve 
done a really good job of creat-
ing a collaborative community 
this year.”

 UMich students, healthcare professionals reflect on STI testing on campus

 Community members speak on reproductive health culture

ISABELLA KASSA
Daily Staff Reporter

With hookup culture and dis-

cussions on sex as common themes 
on college campuses across the 
nation, it’s important to know: how 
is reproductive health valued at the 
University of Michigan? 

In 2019, the University Health 

Services (UHS) discontinued free 
testing for sexual transmitted 
Infections (STIs) until students 
advocated for the need of these free 
and confidential services, leading 
to the program being reinstated 
months later. Since then, STI testing 
has increased at the University but 
what has changed? The Daily spoke 

with students and experts on the 
current state of STI testing and how 
reproductive health can continue to 
improve on campus. 

Dr. Susan Ernst, chief of Gyne-

cology Services at UHS, wrote in 
an email to The Michigan Daily 
that since September 2021, UHS 
has tested just under 2,700 students 
with appointments, and an addi-

tional 8,700 through asymptom-
atic testing, which screens for the 
most common STIs. Ernst also 
wrote that UHS has seen a 23% 
increase in the number of serious 
cases this year.

“We’re finding increased rates 

of STI this year compared to last 
year,” Dr. Ernst wrote. “Specifi-
cally we’ve noted an increase in 

the rate of chlamydia, gonorrhea 
and mycoplasma infections and 
in the more serious (infections) 
for people with a uterus – Pelvic 
Inflammatory Disease, or PID.”

STI testing at the University has 

also increased by over 40% since 
last year, according to Michigan 
Medicine health professionals. One 
of the students who tested positive 

for chlamydia in 2021 shared their 
experience with The Daily. The 
student has requested anonymity 
to preserve the confidentiality of 
their medical record and will be 
referred to as Sam for the rest of 
the story.

I’M LEANING OVER MY 

friend’s shoulder in the middle of 
a party trying to help him guess 
the day’s “Wordle.” The music is 
loud and so are the people, but 
it’s been a long time since I’ve felt 
this locked into a task. Two of our 
friends are sitting next to us also 
trying to solve the puzzle, and 
it soon becomes a group effort 
until we land on the word. Do I 
remember what the word was? 
No. Do I remember all four of 
us exploding in cheers and clap-
ping, briefly drawing the atten-
tion of other partygoers? Yes. Do 
I recognize that it is strange to 
be so absorbed by a word puzzle 
game in the middle of a college 
party? Also yes. However, I don’t 
think many “Wordle” players 
would blame us. 

“Wordle,” the online word 

game that has captivated much 
of the world in recent months, 
was released in October 2021 by 

creator Josh Wardle, who origi-
nally made the game for himself 
and his partner to play during 
the pandemic. “Wordle”’s game-
play is fairly simple: Each day a 
new five-letter word is picked, 
and players have six tries to 
guess it. The puzzle is presented 
as a five-by-six-square grid; the 
game denotes wrong letters in 
gray, correct ones in the wrong 
place in yellow and correct ones 
in the right place in green. The 
game blew up around December 
2021, and became an internet 
phenomenon as people began 
sharing their results in easy-to-
share graphics online.

In November 2021, “Wordle” 

had 90 players and by January, 
that number jumped to over 2 
million. People have a tendency 
to love puzzle games — “Words 
With Friends,” “Candy Crush,” 
“Tetris” — but “Wordle” stands 
out and took off because you 
have six tries to guess the word, 
and whether or not one can guess 
it correctly, those six tries are all 

you have until the next word is 
released. It keeps players on the 
edge of their seats for the next 
puzzle, and since every player 
gets the same word, solving the 
game becomes something of a 
pride point for players online. It 
is good, wholesome fun in our 
pandemic landscape. Devoid of 
politics or opinions, “Wordle” is 
a perfect way for people to con-
nect over a shared love of a free, 

simple word puzzle game (hence 
college students playing during a 
party).

Then The New York Times 

bought “Wordle.” On Jan. 31, 
2022, The New York Times 
acquired the game for some-
where “in the low seven figures.” 
If you’re keeping up, that is at 
least one million dollars. The 
game will be part of The New 
York Times Games section, which 

is home to the publication’s daily 
crossword puzzle and the game 
“Spelling Bee.” The acquisition of 
“Wordle” is a part of The NYT’s 
quest toward “becoming the 
essential subscription for every 
English-speaking person seek-
ing to understand and engage 
with the world.” In a Twitter 
statement, Josh Wardle referred 
to “Wordle”’s popularity and its 
upkeep as “overwhelming” and 
went on to call the purchase 
“very natural.” His excitement 
about the move and handing 
control to a larger team was pal-
pable, so we should all be excited 
for him, right?

Well, let me tell you, the after-

noon of Jan. 31 on Twitter was 
insane. As I logged onto the app 
for probably the millionth time 
that day, I was met with “RIP 
Wordle” on the trending page. 
Most users worried that the 
game would be stuck behind 
The NYT’s notorious paywall. 
One Twitter user summed the 
predicament up pretty well: “ 
I 

have never seen twitter as imme-
diately mad as it is rn about the 
NYT wordle buyout. the NYT 
took one nice and simple thing 
that a lot of people really liked, a 
dumb bit of fun in our exhaust-
ingly dark times, and implied 
that they’ll stick it behind a pay-
wall. exhausting.” Others used 
the opportunity to poke fun at 
the nature of capitalism, “rip 
wordle, there is nothing sacred 
to capitalism apparently.” Some 
turned the acquisition politi-
cal: “NYT buying Wordle is the 
puzzle equivalent of an out-of-
touch politician instantly kill-
ing the appeal of a pop culture 
thing.” The cheekiest among us 
even brought back the classic 
millennial adage, “‘How mil-
lennials killed Wordle’ -NYT 
op-ed tomorrow.” However, the 
humor seemed to be only a thin 
veneer masking a very real sense 
of anger over the acquisition of 
“Wordle.”

‘Wordle’ has a New York Times problem

MRS. 
MAISEL 
(RACHEL 

Brosnahan, “I’m Your Woman”), 
affectionately known as Midge, 
is drunk, on the verge of a break-
down and all-out spiraling after a 
man has completely upended her 
life; her impeccably put-together 
ensemble is only looking ever so 
slightly worse for wear. This is the 
pilot premise of “The Marvelous 
Mrs. Maisel”: a character at abso-
lute rock bottom, who the audience 
inevitably falls in love with as her 
life falls apart. My question is: Why 
is this an equally accurate descrip-
tion of the show’s season four pre-

miere?

The first three seasons of the 

critically acclaimed show have pro-
gressed along steadily, the char-
acter-driven plot hardly having a 
chance to catch its breath against 
the breakneck speed of creator 
Amy Sherman-Palladino’s (“Gilm-
ore Girls”) witty and sharp dia-
logue. To call it fast-paced is akin to 
saying Usain Bolt would fare well 
in a speed-walking contest. Fans of 
the show have come to expect this 
signature trademark of Palladino’s 
writing, so why has Palladino cho-
sen this crucial moment in Midge’s 
trajectory to slow things down and 
go back to where it all started? 

From the downtown New York 

club circuit of season one, to Paris 

and the Catskills in season two, to 
a national tour in season three, the 
scope (and magnificent production 
design I might add) of the show 
has grown, each season building 
on the last, expanding in reach to 
give Midge the proper domain to 
flourish in her stage and familial 
presence. After closing out the last 
two seasons on career highs, Midge 
has been knocked down a rung on 
the ladder of success and finally 
faced some real consequences for 
the impulsivity and raw honesty 
of her act. We’ve regressed further 
than ever before, the parallels to 
the pilot washing over this season’s 
premiere: from familiar apartment 
sets to drunken impromptu stage 
takeovers and, of course, another 

arrest for her rap sheet.

A silver lining to the whole blast-

from-the-past act is the pure con-
tradiction of Midge herself. She 
radiates an air of self-assuredness 
and confidence in her own capa-
bilities so often reserved for male 
characters of incontestable genius 
that is so unbelievably refreshing 
to watch. At times, she can be infu-
riatingly shallow and full of herself 
but, unlike her male counterparts, 
she’s likable. Brosnahan firmly 
grounds her character, makes her 
egoism more endearing than irk-
some, her arrogance more attrac-
tive than aggravating. You can’t 
help but root for her as she runs 
against the grain of a white man’s 
world of comedy. 

Even though Midge isn’t always 

self-aware, the show itself cer-
tainly is. In a moment of laughable 
frustration, she vents to her tod-
dler Esther, “It’s a fucking man’s 
world,” and in response to being 
told to “be the bigger man,” she 
says, “Well, I’m a woman so, fuck 
that.” Midge is headstrong and 
uncompromising in her beliefs; 
a well-seasoned pro has no time 
to spare in doubting her talent or 
questioning her decisions. Apart 
from the initial breakdown, Midge 
bounces back quick as ever and is 
fairly level-headed about moving 
forward after the near-collapse of 
her career. 

A true highlight of this premiere 

is the Wonder Wheel scene at 

Coney Island. Midge’s parents have 
rescheduled Ethan’s (Matteo Pas-
cale, debut) birthday for their con-
venience, to which Midge shows 
up unannounced to tell everyone 
she’s been fired. As per usual, Pal-
ladino never fails to take advantage 
of an overlapping conversational 
scene between the entire family. A 
change of pace from the usual out-
bursts at dinner or the synagogue, 
everyone is shouting and cutting 
each other off as the camera swift-
ly hops from car to car to catch a 
glimpse of everyone’s reaction. It’s 
well-executed and a real testament 
to the show’s smart writing and 
innovative camera work.

The titular protagonist of ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ hits rock bottom… again

‘Kimi’ is frustratingly 

average

IF YOU’VE EVER scrolled end-

lessly through streaming service 
after streaming service, randomly 
picked a movie you’ve never heard 
of starring an actor or actress you 
recognize, mildly enjoyed it and 
then fallen asleep, you probably 
have a good idea of what “Kimi” 
is 
like. 
Steven 
Soderbergh’s 

(“Ocean’s Eleven”) newest film 
“Kimi” isn’t going to blow you 
away or draw you in for a second 
watch, but it also won’t leave you 
upset after spending 90 minutes 
watching it.

“Kimi” is an HBO Max-exclu-

sive, filmed and set during the 
pandemic. It stars Zoë Kravitz 
(“High 
Fidelity”) 
as 
Angela 

Childs, a worker for the tech 
corporation Amygdala. The titu-
lar Kimi, Amygdala’s primary 
product, is an Alexa-esque smart 
speaker that uses human workers 
to correct the errors in its voice 
recognition 
software. 
Angela, 

who suffers from severe anxiety 
and an almost obsessive aversion 
to the outside world, discovers a 
recording of a woman’s murder. 
She is forced to go outside in order 
to bring the recording to the FBI, 
braving hitmen, streets full of pro-
testers and corporate cover-ups.

Kravitz carries much of the 

movie single-handedly. For most 
of the movie, Angela is the only 
character the audience gets to 
see directly, with everyone else 
obfuscated by video calls and 
glass windows. She makes Ange-
la’s anxiety feel realistic, which 
gives the movie’s basic premise 
a solid foundation. Without her 
convincing portrayals of Angela’s 
panic attacks at the idea of going 
outside, this whole movie would 
have felt ridiculous.

There is a noticeable shift in the 

camerawork once Angela leaves 
her apartment. The slow shots of 
her walking throughout her spa-
cious loft that the movie started 
with are gone. We are now treated 
to shaking footage at angles that 
put Angela in the corner, small 
and scared of the world around 
her. The film has a sped-up qual-
ity to it, zoomed out to make the 
camera appear to move faster 
than it actually is, as well as many 
quick cuts, making these scenes 

feel panicked and off-putting. 
These tricks work wonderfully 
the first couple of times they are 
used but become stale by the end 
of the movie. The movie ramps up 
tension for the first half, only to 
then plateau off toward the end.

There is a level of artificiality to 

the tension of the movie. It is rife 
with coincidences that were clear-
ly inserted to obtusely heighten 
the drama of early scenes. A pre-
cariously placed glass falls just as 
Angela first discovers the murder; 
Angela’s boss calls her the moment 
after she discovers the identity 
of the woman on the recording; 
her shut-in neighbor walks up the 
moment Angela is brought back to 
her apartment drugged and about 
to be murdered. All of these coin-
cidences might seem small, but as 
more and more start to build up, 
they become increasingly frus-
trating. The movie is a very tight 
90 minutes; the multitude of fluke 
occurrences feel out of place when 
compared to the well-planned 
chase scenes and anxiety-induc-
ing setup.

The movie is at its best when 

it leans on the paranoia Angela 
feels, especially after she leaves 
her apartment. Every step in her 
quest to uncover the murder she 
stumbled upon is met with doubt 
from the people she meets along 
the way. Her anxiety and discom-
fort are telegraphed for everyone 
in the audience to see very clearly. 
While not subtle, it is nonetheless 
relatable to see a corporate high-
er-up condescendingly talk down 
to Angela, pretending to listen 
when just trying to save their own 
skin. This aspect of the movie was 
the only one that really kept my 
attention and didn’t leave a nag-
ging voice wanting substantially 
more.

“Kimi” 
leaves 
you 
under-

whelmed with the knowledge that 
you could have been given more. 
The filmmakers demonstrate that 
they know what they are doing, 
but at very key points, seem to 
have chosen the easy route. The 
movie doesn’t try to go above 
and beyond; instead, it settles 
as another enjoyably forgettable 
action thriller.

IT IS INTEGRAL to seek out Black 

voices at any point in the year, and 
especially during Black History Month. 
In hopes of highlighting voices that 
are oftentimes wrongfully overlooked, 
The Michigan Daily Book Review came 
together to curate a list of some of our 
favorite Black-authored novels. Read 
ahead to find books to read for Black 
History Month and beyond.

“Memorial” by Bryan Washing-

ton

Called a “queer traumedy” by the 

author, “Memorial” by Bryan Wash-
ington centers on the dysfunctional 
relationship between two queer men 
of color. The protagonists, Mike and 
Benson, are in their 30s and lead 
unglamorous lives, struggling with 
weight and other insecurities. They 
spend most of the novel apart. When 
Mike finds out his estranged father 
has been terminally diagnosed with 
cancer, he jets out to Japan, leaving 
his partner Benson behind to receive 
and entertain Mike’s visiting mother. 
What follows is the gradual bonding 
of Mike’s traditional Japanese mother 
with Benson, an HIV-positive daycare 
teacher.

In Japan, Mike slowly acquaints 

himself with his difficult father. The 
novel is bursting with beautiful turns 
of phrase and quiet character develop-
ment that builds to a satisfying climax. 
Honest to god, the novel made me cry 
— I didn’t know how much I needed 
middle-aged, unsexy queer sex until 
I got it. Washington, illustrating how 
family can both anchor and damage us 
well into adulthood, coaxes out tears 
of love and sympathy.

“Pet” by Akwaeke Emezi
“Pet” by Akwaeke Emezi is a bone-

chilling YA fantasy that focuses on 
Jam, a Black trans teen in Lucille (a 
town that claims to be free of mon-
sters), as she accidentally conjures the 
eponymous Pet, a “monster”-hunter 
from another universe. Emezi wrote 
the piece in response to the “mass 
gaslighting” they feel occurs with the 
intentional ignorance of many older 
people when younger generations 
worry about issues of injustice; at first 
glance, the title appears oversimpli-
fied, but as you settle into the novel, 
the metaphor takes on new meaning.

As Jam tries to investigate the pres-

ence of monsters, the adults in her life 
do everything to get her to ignore the 
surrounding evil — not because they 
don’t respect Jam’s perceptions of the 
world, but because they’re afraid of 
what they’ll have to admit to them-
selves should they listen to Jam. As 
we follow Jam’s interactions with Pet 
and her best friend Redemption in the 
208-page novel, the tale settles into a 
rhythm that peaks in a graphic con-
frontation at the end — even though 
the book is for young adults, any read-
er will be able to enjoy this slightly 
terrifying work of speculative fiction.

Emezi’s body of work is dynamic, 

ranging from literary fiction to auto-
biography to (upcoming) romance; 
readers can consume more of Emezi’s 
complex, illustrative writing (made 
accessible for younger readers) in 
“Pet.” The novel was overlooked when 
it was released; for many reasons, it 
should be reconsidered as a work of 
YA genius that is sure to stay relevant 
for decades.

“My Sister, the Serial Killer” by 

Oyinkan Braithwaite

“My Sister, the Serial Killer” by 

Oyinkan Braithwaite was published 
in 2018, and I haven’t stopped rec-
ommending it since. Set in Lagos, 
Nigeria, the book revolves around 
three central characters: Korede, a 
nurse; Ayoola, her younger sister; and 

their mother. Ayoola is known for 
her beauty and is the preferred sister 
of the two. Though she is beloved in 
the community, Ayoola has impulsive 
murderous tendencies, as is revealed 
by the title. Korede is constantly 
forced to clean up her sister’s messes, 
both figuratively and literally. All of 
Ayoola’s boyfriends end up dead, yet 
she is continuously discounted as a 
suspect. Though Korede has tried to 
stop Ayoola from killing, it isn’t until 
Ayoola starts to hang around Korede’s 
coworker crush that Korede finally 
intervenes. 

Though the novel’s primary focus is 

the relationship between Ayoola and 
Korede and Ayoola’s ceaseless mur-
ders, Braithwaite includes another 
storyline that focuses on their late 
father. As the story progresses, flash-
backs about their father are revealed 
that leave the reader pondering the 
circumstances of his death and the 
role both Ayoola and Korede might 
have played in it. 

Braithwaite’s expert pacing and 

crafty divulgence of family secrets 
make “My Sister, the Serial Killer” 
a quick, exciting read. The plot is 
gruesomely addicting, the characters 
impressively 
complex. 
Braithwaite 

tests each character and the reader by 
extension, begging us to question who 
we can trust and what information is 
true.

“They Were Her Property: White 

Women as Slave Owners in the 
American 
South” 
by 
Stephanie 

Jones-Rogers

“They Were Her Property” is an 

illuminating look into the active role 
that white women played in American 
slavery. Oftentimes, narratives around 
slavery focus solely on the harm of the 
white male slave owners while only 
giving 
negligible 
acknowledgment 

that white women were also part of 
the problem. Jones-Rogers pushes 
back on the idea that white women 
were bystanders and uses first-person 
narratives and legal documents to 
show that white women directly bene-
fited from and engaged in the practice 
of slave labor. 

Combining discussions of gender, 

race and economics, “They Were Her 
Property” revolutionized the way 
I think of myself and other white 
women. At the end of the book, Jones-
Rogers talks about the ways in which 
white women’s personal investments 
in slavery pushed them to uphold 
systems of white supremacy and seg-
regation in the South post-Civil War. 
By better understanding the ways 
in which white women have histori-
cally benefitted from the subjuga-
tion of Black people, we can better 
understand their role in other white 
supremacist movements following the 
Civil War and today.

“Native Son” by Richard Wright
“Native Son” is a book I was required 

to read in high school but has stayed 
with me far past graduation. Written 
in the 1940s, it follows a young Black 
man, Bigger, living in poverty in Chi-
cago who gets a job working for a rich 
white family. After an unfortunate 
situation causes Bigger to commit a 
major crime, he struggles to outsmart 
and outrun authorities and is quickly 
caught and thrown in jail. While in 
jail, Bigger has a long conversation 
with his lawyer where he grapples 
with his identity as a Black man.

This book is good because of its 

engaging plot, but great because it 
forces readers to understand them-
selves in the unfairness of Bigger’s 
situation and the system that is up 
against him. Wright never makes Big-
ger’s crime okay, but rather helps the 
reader realize that it was the forces 
out of Bigger’s control that led him to 
that point.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY 

BOOK REVIEW

CARMEN 
MARIA 

MACHADO and her work is 
everything and everywhere 
at once. On a chaotic, snowy 
day on campus, I was grate-
ful to finally catch her in 
UMMA’s Stern Auditorium.

Machado, 
the 
current 

guest in the Zell Visiting 
Writers Series, is known for 
her work across nearly every 
genre of writing: humor, 
comic books, short fiction, 
essay, memoir and journal-
ism. Her work is featured in 
art exhibitions and album 
covers (most recently, Phoe-
be Bridgers’s Punisher), and 
celebrated globally, recently 
awarded with the Lambda 
Literary Award for LGBTQ 
Nonfiction and The Ameri-
can Booksellers Association’s 
Indies Choice Book Awards.

Machado’s most famous 

work, a series of short sto-
ries titled “Her Body and 
Other Parties,” unpacks the 
lives of women through their 
bodily experiences in stun-
ningly real science fiction. In 
her memoir, “In the Dream 
House,” she flips what we 
think we know about mem-
oirs, depicting life and com-
plex relationships through 
a surrealist lens. Her recent 
comic series, “The Low Low 
Woods,” addresses complex 
social issues through night-
mare-ish comic strips. Her 
unmistakable genre-bending 
style is why The New York 
Times named her a member 
of The New Vanguard.

In this reading, Machado 

does what she does best: give 
readers a completely differ-
ent worldview, in this case, 
literally. In her 2017 short 
story, Blur, a woman loses her 
glasses at a highway rest stop 
on the way to meet her girl-
friend and blindly searches 
for hope in an unfamiliar 
world.

Machado takes us through 

this unfamiliar and unset-
tling experience as if we 
were experiencing it first 
hand. 
Her 
low 
whisper 

shakes the audience as we 
see reality through the nar-
rator’s troubled eyes. The 
rich imagery (mostly audi-
tory) snaps us back and forth 
between the harsh, and at 
times, funny, reality of the 
rest stop, and the narrator’s 
racing thoughts as she fears 
the fallout with her abusive 
girlfriend. 

The darkness and disori-

entation pick up as Machado 
delves into a confusing bed-
lam of sounds, colors and 
feelings. Machado takes the 
audience out of their near 
trance-like 
states 
as 
she 

switches voices. Machado 
turns into key characters 
with no names: the rude 
mother who promises her 
children did not steal the 
glasses, the girlfriend who 
hypothetically screams at the 
narrator, begging to know 
“who she is fucking” at the 
rest stop, the woman in the 
bathroom who prays and the 
almost surreal “man in the 
blue suit.”

Machado slows her read-

ing as the man in the blue 

suit hands the narrator a 
candy bar, the “sweetest 
thing I’ve tasted in years,” 
and later speeds up as they 
walk the distance to Indi-
ana together. The narrator’s 
mind races with fear of the 
future and reflections on 
past moments. Her tone sud-
denly changes as if reading us 
a ghost story. The man in the 
blue suit narrates the story of 
a woman who could not see 
and devoted her life and love 
to a horrible monster. The 
clear parallels between the 
monster and the girlfriend 
make Machado’s narrative as 
a whole all the more haunt-
ing. As the narrator and the 
man in the blue suit continue 
their highway journey, the 
audience is left in painful 
suspense.

As Machado transitions to 

the Question & Answer por-
tion of the night, her haunt-
ing tone suddenly switches 
to a jovial one. She sits for a 
talk with MFA student Anna 
Majeski that feels like an 
enriching dinner party con-
versation that the audience is 
allowed to watch. Machado 
discusses her love of others’ 
work, ranging from “Law & 
Order: Special Victims Unit” 
to Shirley Jackson’s short 
stories, her struggles with 
anxiety and her dreams and 
nightmares that inspire all of 
her work.

Machado’s work famously 

deals with sickness, which 
she says is a “way into her 
own fear,” the “best space” 
for her to write. She laughs as 
she describes COVID-19 as 
something out of a story she 

wrote. She is honest, funny 
and nothing like the dark 
and horrifying scenes she 
creates for millions of read-
ers around the world. She 
explains that these stories 
come directly from her fears, 
like her recent comic series, 
straight 
from 
her 
worst 

nightmare of leaving a movie 
theater with amnesia. Her 
stories also come from the 
frightening realities of life, 
especially the female expe-
rience. She calls the repeat-
ed themes of her work the 
things she “just can’t shake.”

Her constant anecdotes 

are reminiscent of her writ-
ing, in which a single page 
carries infinite stories. Yet, 
just like with her writing, 
every word she speaks has a 
purpose.

As the Q&A opens to the 

auditorium and Zoom audi-
ences, everyone is starstruck. 
Nearly everyone who comes 
to the microphone calls her 
an inspiration. Yet she main-
tains her humility, laughing 
as she teaches the audience 
lessons on forming plots by 
“throwing things at the wall 
and seeing if they stick” and 
building upon character per-
spectives.

As the night ends, readers 

line up to chat with Macha-
do and get her works auto-
graphed. The event goes over 
by nearly 30 minutes, and 
the audience hopes to follow 
Machado into whatever real-
ity she creates next.

THE COLD FEBRUARY 

rain didn’t stop dodie fans 
from arriving early to the 
Royal Oak Music Theater 
for the fifth night of her 
“Build A Problem” Tour. 
Bundled up in winter coats 
and umbrellas in hand, a 
long line of fans wrapped 
around the timeless the-
ater in eager anticipation 
for the UK-based singer-
songwriter’s performance. 

For many (myself includ-

ed), this show was the first 
concert since the COVID-
19 pandemic began, and 
dodie surely didn’t dis-
appoint with her warm 
welcome back to a live 
performance. Taking the 
stage with her five band 
members, 
dodie 
kicked 

off the night with “Air So 
Sweet” off of her May 2021 
album, Build A Problem. 
“We’re going to delve into 
feelings,” the 26-year-old 
singer announced before 
transitioning into “Cool 
Girl,” also off of her latest 
album.

After kicking off the 

night with newer music, 
dodie announced that she 
would be revisiting some 
of her older songs. Sitting 
at her rustic piano, she 
laughed into the micro-
phone, admitting that she 
was “on the right side of 
drunk” after taking a shot 
with her bandmates before 
the show. Besides a few 
faulty chords, one could 
never tell that dodie was 
feeling a bit tipsy — her 
vocal delivery was flawless 
and possessed the pensive, 
nostalgic energy that had 
audience members swoon-
ing and wiping away tears.

dodie is an extremely 

talented 
and 
versatile 

performer, and she kept 
the 
audience 
on 
their 

toes from start to finish. 
Between 
her 
spontane-

ous interpretive dancing 
and clarinet and drum 
solos, dodie’s performance 
remained 
true 
to 
the 

authentic, 
quirky 
musi-

cianship that launched her 
career nearly six years ago. 
What’s most remarkable 
about dodie, however, is 
the way she connects with 
her fans. When she’s on 
stage, she’s constantly on 
the move, dancing along-
side her band members and 
offering witty responses 
to fans when they’d shout 
messages of love. At one 
point an audience mem-
ber even hurled their bra 
on stage, to which dodie 
asked, “Alright whose bra 
is that?” while suppressing 
a fitful of laughter. 

Just how dear fans hold 

dodie was most clear when 
she 
performed 
“Rain-

bow.” 
Before 
perform-

ing the song off of Build 
A Problem, dodie asked 
the crowd, “Who here is 
gay?” to which the crowd 
erupted into a clamor of 
applause and shouts. dodie, 
who is bisexual and a 
champion for the LGBTQ-
IA+ community, beamed 
and explained how “Rain-
bow” is a song she wrote to 
overcome the stigmas she 
has witnessed and expe-
rienced as a queer person 
who grew up in a conser-
vative town that was cold 
toward 
the 
LGBTQIA+ 

community. With rainbow 
lights accompanying dodie 
and her band, there were 

cheers and tears shed as 
the Royal Oak Music The-
ater celebrated love in all 
of its forms. 

Perhaps the most mov-

ing part of the night was 
when dodie performed her 
2019 hit “She.” After play-
ing the song on the piano 
to a chorus of fans sing-
ing along, dodie explained 
how she tries to find new 
meaning in her older songs 
when she performs them 
live. On that cold Febru-
ary night, dodie expressed 
how “She” has become a 
metaphor for her past self 
who felt trapped in her 
hometown, 
a 
reminder 

of how far she has come 
since the days when she 
felt ashamed of her queer 
identity. The auditorium 
was still as she described 
how she’s so happy to see 
more acceptance of the 
LGBTQIA+ 
community 

and how much she wished 
that her younger self could 
have had the support she 
has now. 

dodie’s 
U.S. 
tour 

includes 
opener 
Lizzy 

McAlpine, a singer-song-
writer from Philadelphia. 
As the lights dimmed in 
the theater, fans chanted 
“Lizzy” until the 22-year-
old singer-songwriter took 
the stage for an acoustic 
set. Performing songs off 

of her upcoming album five 
seconds flat, the packed 
theater was filled with a 
chorus of voices reciting 
every word to McAlpine’s 
songs. The only thing that 
could have rivaled McAl-
pine’s set were her retro 
jeans, as several shouts of 
“I like your pants!” were 
heard 
from 
across 
the 

auditorium. 
During 
her 

set, McAlpine even com-
mented on how the audi-
ence “sounded so good” 
while singing along to her 
songs. 

For 
both 
McAlpine 

and dodie’s performanc-
es, nearly every person 
around me knew all of 
the words to their songs 
and was singing along the 
entire time. Some fans 
knew the music so well 
that they were even har-
monizing with the band, 
creating 
a 
mesmerizing 

sea of voices. This phe-
nomenon alone is a true 
testament to the energy 
both dodie and McAlpine 
brought to Royal Oak, and 
it was beautiful to witness 
two powerful songwriters 
pour love into their art and 
share that love with their 
fans.

Michigan in Color
6 — Wednesday, March 9, 2022

Growing up as a young South Asian 

girl in a small city in Michigan, find-
ing representation in music always 
felt nearly impossible. I had two easy 
options when it came to listening to 
music. I could either listen to whatev-
er was trending in the U.S., or I could 
listen to the South Asian music my 
mother would blast on her phone while 
cooking. And as much as I loved lis-
tening to A. R. Rahman and Dhanush 
while helping my mother roll out her 
chapatis on a random Tuesday night, 
I never felt seen by their artistry. It 
wasn’t music I could dive into, get-
ting lost in the melodies, replaying the 
lyrics over and over in my head like a 
trance. 

My knowledge of Tamil is very 

limited. I can understand basic con-
versational Tamil and repeat back a 
whopping 14 words. So understanding 
fluent melodic Tamil was already a 
challenge, but being able to sing along 
to the lyrics was unimaginable. So I 
did what 11-year-old me thought was 
my only option — listened to the radio. 
98.7 was my channel. I’d get into my 
mom’s car from school and immedi-
ately pause the Tamil song she was lis-
tening to since I couldn’t understand 
the lyrics, just to put on Detroit’s 98.7, 
which played whatever was trending 
on the Billboard Hot 100. Through 
the years, this radio obsession quickly 
switched over to whatever song my 
brother played in the car through his 
phone in middle school, eventually 
then jumping to whatever my friends 
listened to or what Spotify recom-
mended to me in high school. I could 
understand and sing along to every 
song I heard. But gaining this meant I 

lost any form of the musical represen-
tation that the Tamil music gave me.

So a few years back, I fell into a Spo-

tify playlist searching frenzy, finding 
South Asian artists that I could listen 
to, enjoy and relate to. After finding a 
few that I featured in part one, I decid-
ed to continue my hunt. Here are some 
more of my favorite artists so far. 

Nikhil Ramani
Nikhil Ramani is originally from 

Chennai, a city in South India, where 
my family currently resides. Both he 
and his roommate, Luke Duckworth, 
have been creating music together 
and releasing it on Spotify since 2020. 
Through this, Ramani has accumu-
lated over 1,500 monthly listeners. I 
stumbled upon Ramani’s music last 
October when I heard the duo’s song 
“seventeen.” The song grapples with 
the end of one’s youth: the period of 
shifting from adolescence to adult-
hood, reflecting on all the fun times 
they had as teens. The lyrics paint 
a clear story about Ramani and his 
friends when they were younger, filled 
with imagery about the “Chennai heat” 
and the “salty breeze” that loomed 
around Ramani growing up. This 
was one of the first things that made 
me gravitate so strongly to Ramani’s 
music. The lyrics were so direct, let-
ting me follow along to his story as if 
I were there. It made his music feel 
so homey and relatable. As if he was 
someone you knew, could talk to and 
listen to for hours. The music felt raw 
and less manufactured, almost like a 
home video, something so hard to find 
nowadays. To get into Ramani’s music, 
start by listening to “seventeen” and 
“Halfway Across the World.”

Anjali Taneja
Taneja is an Indian-American artist 

releasing music since 2017. Her latest 
single, “How It Feels,” has been play-
ing on rotation in my Spotify playlists 
since its release in January. Her music 
takes a unique spin on R‘n’B through 
a more indie sound, creating a flowy 
feeling that cannot help but bring out 
a deep calmness. The equal blending 
between the music and more relaxed 
vocals drew me into Taneja’s music. 
“How It Feels” is a song that imme-
diately makes me close my eyes and 
forget every pressure in my life for 
two minutes and 18 seconds. Her song 
“Paradise” has become another one 
of my favorites. The song title itself 
describes the vibe of the song, exud-
ing a light and airy feeling. To get into 
Taneja’s music, start by listening to 
“Paradise,” “Keepsake” and “How It 
Feels.”

Shravya Kamaraju
Kamaraju is a singer and songwriter 

who first started out by making covers 
of popular songs on TikTok. She would 
add desi influences, like adding Bolly-
wood mashups to the covers which led 
to her rise in popularity. From TikTok, 
she began creating her own music. Her 
most popular song has amassed over 
220,000 Spotify streams. I first lis-
tened to Kamaraju this past summer, 
when she released “Fire Hazard.” The 
song focuses on the outside world pres-
sures she faces as both a young adult 
and college student. With lyrics like 
“carrying the weight of the world on 
my shoulders” and “all in good time 
/ even natural disasters subside,” the 
song centers on how she’s falling apart 
with too much on her plate, but still 
wanting more but with the hope that 
eventually this feeling of dread and 
pressure will pass. The upbeat music 
contrasts with the feeling of mental 
exhaustion translated through the lyr-

ics, highlighting the hope that things 
will get better. To get into Kamaraju’s 
music, start by listening to “Fire Haz-
ard” and “Night to Remember.”

hrishi
With only five tracks released on 

Spotify, Indian American artist hri-
shi is quickly gaining popularity. He 
brings his desi music influences into 
both his TikTok covers and his origi-
nal music. hrishi was trained in Car-
natic music, a traditional style in South 
India, for over 10 years, and highlights 
this talent in his music while creating 
Carnatic remixes of popular songs on 
his TikTok. His song “20somethin” 
begins with clear Carnatic vocals. The 
song was released in May 2021 and 
has already picked up over 130,000 
Spotify streams. The lyrics focus on 
young adult life and how it isn’t always 
the life of the party society paints. To 
get into his music, start by listening to 
“20somethin” and “Paul McCartney 
(superstar).”

Sne
With only 203 monthly listeners, 

Sne’s music is severely underrated. Her 
most popular song, “Honey,” show-
cases Sne’s smooth and sweet vocals. 
Every time this song plays through 
my earbuds, I can’t help but just fall 
back in bed and lie there all day while 
the song sits on repeat, losing track of 
time in her melodic golden voice that 
perfectly flows across the music and 
immediately sends me into a trance. 
The lyrics focus on fantasizing about 
someone — the thought of them con-
sumes your mind the way Sne’s voice 
does, echoing in the back of your head. 
Where being with them becomes the 
only wish and thought you have. Even 
with only four songs out, Sne has 
quickly climbed my Spotify hierarchy 

and become one of my most listened to 
artists. To get into her music, start by 
listening to “Honey” and “Miss You.”

Dameer
Dameer is a singer and songwriter 

born and raised in Bangladesh. His 
Bangladeshi roots mix with the West-
ern musical influences he heard grow-
ing up to create his modern sunshine 
indie sound. His song “Michelle,” with 
over 700,000 Spotify streams, diffus-
es a happy feeling every time it plays. 
Hearing the song for the first time sent 
me into a spiral of queuing every one of 
his songs over and over, until I could 
quote every lyric. Dameer’s first 2018 
releases quickly created buzz, lead-
ing to an album release in 2019 called 
“For We Are Distant.” This past year, 
Dameer has gone independent, break-
ing away from the label he signed 
with as a teenager, releasing “Bashbo 
Bhalo,” his first independent song as 
well as his first song fully in Bangla. To 
get into his music, start by listening to 
“Michelle” and “Air.”

All these artists have given me music 

that I can dive into. Music whose mel-
odies I can get lost in. Music whose 
lyrics I can replay in my head. Music 
that I can lie in bed all day and listen 
to, daydreaming to the sound of their 
voices. Music I wouldn’t mind play-
ing in the background while I help my 
mother roll out another batch of chapa-
tis on the weekends when I’m home 
from college. But most importantly, it’s 
music that I can listen to and still feel 
close to my South Asian roots. They’re 
artists who represent me and artists I 
can relate to. I have compiled a playlist 
with all of the mentioned songs as well 
as other South Asian artists I think you 
should start listening to. I hope you lis-
ten and enjoy. 

South Asian artists you need to start listening to! Pt. 2

Where are you from?

I have often been quite wary 

of the question, “Where are you 
from?” 

Mainly because I felt like there 

was no answer that accurately 
informed the inquirer about who 
I am or what has formed me. 

You see, I could answer with a 

good selection of locations, yet all 
of them result in more questions, 
more doubt, more confusion and 
none of them provide the clarity 
that you, the asker, might be look-
ing for.

I am a habitual victim of the 

question, “but like where are you 
really from?” 

So much so that I refuse to 

answer with a location at all. 

I am from my father’s house, I 

say 

A man who arrived in the 

United States at the ripe age of 29 
as Adeoye but whose colleagues 
currently address him by John 

You see, I am no stranger to 

assimilation

A month prior to my senior 

year of high school, my father 
informs me that we will be mov-
ing back to the states from Mapu-
to, Mozambique 

My first day of school senior 

year, I was introduced as “Sarah 
from Africa.”

I had a strong accent that has 

since been rid of 

My Portuguese slang was not 

quite understood

I am from throwing away parts 

of my identity for the comfort of 
others. 

I am from my mother’s aspira-

tions 

A woman who never fails to 

plan 

Who puts everything into her 

children 

Who taught me what it looks 

like to be a good friend 

I come from good friends 
Around the world who know 

me better than I know myself 

Who are willing to give me 

advice in English, in Portuguese, 
in Yoruba, in whatever language 

will make it stick that I am loved

I come from love. 
I come from writing love 

poems to boys who will never 
read them 

Writing lines like 
“I don’t believe in scripted 

prayers but the part about you is 
pretty much the same every time” 

Or 
“To be honest sometimes I just 

felt like your moon, an empty 
beacon by which your light shone 
through. I loved that I could 
show the world what it was like 
to be close to you.” 

I am from looking for love in all 

the wrong places.

I am from my paternal grand-

mother’s confidence

A matriarch who was the first 

young girl in Ikere Ekiti, Nigeria 
to pass the exam into secondary 
school without status and with-
out wealth 

I, too, am familiar with the 

feeling of being in rooms that 
people wonder how I got into 

I am from constantly proving 

that I am worthy. 

I am from constantly saying 

goodbye 

Never getting attached 
Always wondering when the 

director will say cut

When I will be plucked out of 

this scene and forced into anoth-
er. 

I am from the theatre
A performer, truly 
So much so that I no longer 

know the difference between 
who I am and who I pretend to be. 

I am from a Black woman that 

came from a Black woman that 
came from a Black woman 

Or whatever Rihanna said. 
And I will give birth to a Black 

woman 

I am from amazing mothers 
I am from never doubting my 

appearance because generations 
of men fell in love with women 
that look like me. 

I am from pretty brown skin 
That people write poems about 
I am from constantly writing 

poems but never calling myself a 
poet.

Holding onto and letting 
go of the hypothetical you

The ironic erotic

“Suck my dick,” among its many vul-

gar variations, remains a hallmark 
of the various mundane and profane 
phrases heterosexual men utter to 
each other every day. Maybe it’s the 
immense and intense visceral sensa-
tionalism, the colorful imaginative 
elicitation, a temporal subconscious 
sexual re-orientation or perhaps just a 
joke, but there appears to be an ongoing 
tendency among straight men every-
where to ironically express erotic sen-
timents toward each other. What might 
seem to be a banal social phenomenon 
in actuality places us in an expansive 
linguistic liminality, especially when 
we consider the broader implications 
these suggestive sayings hold in rela-
tion to homo-sociality, masculinity and 
manhood as a whole. 

To philosophy scholar Jeff Casey, 

“Queerness is a specter that haunts 
straight male relations.” He maintains 
that 
straight 
masculinity 
contains 

within it a colossal amount of internal 
contradictions. The rigid chains of het-
eronormativity, the paradoxes of the 
patriarchal system and the corruptive 
nature of capitalist ideology all serve as 
a testament to the fervent and phallic 
testosterone-fueled psyche of the mod-
ern (heterosexual) man. The creation 
of class society (a male invention) has 
structured our current social existence 
to be rife with unfettered individual-
ism, competition and vice, thus antago-
nizing any authentic intimacy among 
men. 

It is ironic that the subtext of many 

straight male bonding activities is 
exquisitely erotic. Jungian psycho-
therapist Thomas Moore ascribes our 
bodies as imaginative, mythical and 
mythological erotic landscapes. Our 
penchant for literalism hinders us from 
seeing the inherent homo-sociality 
in the male-dominated endeavors of 
contact sports, video gaming, working 
out, pre-going out rituals and night-
life, Greek Life, the military and gang 
activities. As Black womanist Audre 
Lorde describes, the erotic can be 
viewed as “providing the power which 
comes from sharing deeply any pursuit 
with another person.” When consider-

ing the notions of Moore and Lorde in 
tandem, it becomes clear that much of 
male homo-sociality is simultaneously 
homo-erotic (not to be infused/con-
fused with homo-sexual). Eros, accord-
ing to French writer Georges Bataille, 
always entails a certain transgression. 
Sports and video games simulate (phys-
ically or virtually) a breaking of soci-
etal norms and behaviors through their 
systemic brutality. We inter-act in ways 
in which we normally wouldn’t. Act is 
the key word here. The performance 
of masculinity that many straight men 
act out is characterized by what sociol-
ogy scholar David Grazian describes as 
“relentless competitive spirit, distant 
emotional detachment, an insatiable 
heterosexual desire, all commonly dis-
played by the sexual objectification of 
women.”

Grazian likens the male affairs of 

nightlife as a homo-social “girl-hunting” 
ritual rife with rivalry. He makes the 
claim that pre-gaming — which often 
occurs along gendered lines — involves 
an indulgence in drinking, drugs and 
party music, which maintains and fast 
lanes confidence and courage for the 
night ahead. In the animalistic world of 
mating and dating, Graizan proclaims 
that males’ peers remain the “intended 
audience” for their performance. With 
their sexual encounters as events of the 
ego, paradoxically, many men objectify 
women, not just for ephemeral plea-
sure, but in order to gain high standing 
and status, high ranking and reputation 
among each other. And the post-gaming 
cool-down, run-down and discourses 
of the night between male friends only 
furthers this phenomenon.

As feminist theorist Marilyn Fryre 

explains in “The Politics of Reality,” 
“All or almost all of that which per-
tains to love, most straight men reserve 
exclusively for other men. The people … 
whose respect, admiration, recognition, 
reverence and love they desire … those 
are overwhelmingly other men … From 
women they want devotion, service and 
sex.” The favorite actors and musicians, 
athletes and politicians of straight men 
remain majority male. Y’all saw their 
Spotify Wrapped reveals. Ironically, 
straight men seek approval from other 
(straight) men above all else while 
often avoiding actual intimacy. 

Casey claims that “Paradoxically, the 

embodied desire for heteronormativ-
ity depends upon homosocial relations 
that in turn often manifest homoerot-
ic and even homosexual desires and 
behaviors.” In other words, in con-
structing a society of male supremacy 
built on rigid gender binaries and hege-
monic masculinity, heterosexual men 
have indirectly subjugated themselves 
into segregated same-sex spaces, all 
of which hold ambiguously erotic ori-
entations. This is not to suggest that 
straight men are repressed homosexu-
als, but quite the contrary. Such spaces 
simultaneously create what gender 
scholars Nils Hammarén and Thomas 
Johansson refer to as a “straight panic 
in which individuals experience anxi-
ety about how others perceive their 
sexuality, and thus, feel a need to con-
firm their heterosexuality.” 

Inevitably, heterosexuality requires 

homophobia. Psychology scholar Greg-
ory Herek asserts that hegemonic mas-
culinity is in part determined by “what 
it is not — that is, not feminine and not 
homosexual.” It is not enough to not be 
gay, but one must be anti-gay as a means 
of maintaining and reaffirming one’s 
status as heterosexual. Likewise, sexu-
ality scholar Jay Clarkson claims that 
“even the most masculine gay man’s 
homosexuality denies him the ability 
to truly achieve the power inherent in 
hegemonic masculinity no matter how 
masculine the gender performance 
because he will always be marginalized 
simply because he is not heterosexual.” 
 

While growing up, I presented more 

feminine and flamboyantly than I do 
today. I was thus incessantly mocked 
and made fun of, mostly by other males, 

for how I dressed and spoke, for my 
mannerisms and mere existence in 
the world. I was threatened by those I 
thought I was close to — called a fag-
got to my face and behind my back by 
boys I thought were my friends. Even 
today, as I stand comfortably in my own 
queerness and bi-sexuality, many of my 
relationships with straight men have 
felt oppressive, rife with unequal power 
dynamics and treatment. My sexuality 
is rarely seen as legitimate to theirs. 
The comfortability, desires and pref-
erences of straight men, without fail, 
prevail over anyone else. Embracing my 
bi-sexuality has become complicated by 
our society’s dualistic tendencies to see 
everything within the binary of male/
female, masculine/feminine or gay/
straight. The hyper-masculinization 
and hyper-sexualization of Black men 
as well as the vast array of anti-queer 
sentiments within the Black commu-
nity have ultimately convoluted my 
ability to be physically, emotionally or 
spiritually intimate with anyone. Yet 
as queer liberation theologist Marcella 
Althaus Reid posits, bi-sexuality is not 
limited to a physical sexual practice but 
a mode of thinking that transgresses 
the constrictive boundaries of being. 
At the end of eternity, our souls have no 
sex. Sadly, many straight and gay men 
and women persistently perpetuate bi-
phobia, abnegating the multi-faceted 
essence of our existence. Nonetheless, 
it is clear that queer men as a whole will 
never hold as much worth in society as 
their straight counterparts.

Along these same lines, the irony of 

straight male ironic eroticism is evi-
dent in how simultaneously aligned 

yet antithetical it is to actuality. Con-
versational irony is an “intentionally 
inconsistent” verbalization, which is 
often associated with aggressiveness, 
a common characteristic of hegemonic 
masculinity. In conversational irony, 
there is often an opposition between 
what is said and what is meant. Yet as 
linguistic scholars Rachel Giora and 
Ofer Fein explain, irony does not entail 
an elimination of what has been said yet 
“communicates the difference between 
the dictum and the implicatum.” So 
when straight men say “suck my dick” 
to other men, it might mean metaphori-

cally to merely “shut up” or may sug-
gest some other negative evaluative 
expression. Nevertheless, we can also 
understand what is literally being said 
as an exemplification of hidden values: 
receiving (oral) is traditionally associ-
ated with masculine sexual dominance, 
while giving is seen as passive submis-
sion. Note, keeping with the patriar-
chal positioning and the corrosion of 
capitalist ideology, giving and receiv-
ing become imbued with a hierarchical 
structure in which to give is perceived 

as lesser. Thus, an ironically erotic 
demand for one of the same-sex to suck 
another man’s dick presupposes the act 
of giving orally and being passive as an 
inferior state of being. 

Even in queer spaces, topping, which 

does admittedly correlate with giving 
nevertheless maintains it’s connection 
to “manliness” through it’s concur-
rence with penetration. Despite the 
venereal vulnerability of bottoming 
and its bodily byproducts, to bottom 
in today’s times is to be subjugated to 
relative femininity, literal passivity 
and fallacious inferiority as a result of 
our colonial conditioning. As critical 
gender and culture scholars Billy-Ray 
Belcourt, George Dust and Kay Gabriel 
assert, “In a homonormative semiotics 
of sex, topping is an enactment of gen-
der; it is a performance of masculinity, 
which is bound up in the erotic life of 
whiteness.”

The unnerving notions of neo-lib-

eralism — as observed in our culture’s 
collective digital mediation of sexuality 
through the seductive lure of algorith-
mically antagonistic corporate-owned 
social media, dating and hook-up apps, 
as well as the co-optation and de-radi-
calization of queerness — has manufac-
tured within modern-day queer spaces 
an 
all-encompassing 
superficiality 

and hyper-sexuality. To Belcourt et al, 
“Relations between gay men are stuck 
in the rut of the sexual.”

It makes sense, then, why “suck 

my dick” and other erotic explica-
tives issued by heterosexual males are 
expressed as ironic. The hyper-sexual 
nature of homo-eroticism pervades all 
same-sex male interactions. Beyond

It only takes a slight glance in 

my direction or a minor corridor-
collision and an ensuing “Oh, I’m so 
sorry about that” (or god forbid, a 
single conversation) for me to start 
mentally arranging the furniture in 
our future quaint suburban home by 
the sea. My heart swells, I suddenly 
can’t find my words and my face red-
dens. I begin to sweat if I’m wearing 
my leather jacket, and I probably am 
because, secretly, I want you to com-
pliment my outfit. And when you do 
give me that validation, I smile so 
wide it feels like the outer corners of 
my lips tear at their flesh-fashioned 
seams, but I’m hoping you’ll find it 
endearing. And when I fall asleep, 
you appear in my dreams.

I’m hoping you won’t judge me, 

but I didn’t really become a hopeless 
romantic until anime poisoned my 
impressionable brain in early middle 
school. From Kirito and Asuna to 
Sakuta and Mai, most of the anime 
I watched portrayed romance as 
dramatically direct love confessions 
while the characters sit atop high 
school rooftops at sunset or watch 
fireworks shows at the summer 
festival together. Yet the buildup 
to these relationships are predict-
able and uncomplicated; the audi-
ence knows from the beginning that 
the two main love interests will get 
together. I didn’t even know liking 
boys was an option for me until I 
was at least 14, so while other kids 
my age were making out behind the 
classroom buildings after school, I 
could only live vicariously through 
the media I consumed. 

Amid mentally selecting the fonts 

for our future wedding invitations, 
the picture of my parents’ wedding 
photo sitting on my grandmoth-
er’s old dining table appears in my 
imagination. They stand hand in 
hand, beaming directly at the cam-
era and consequently, the viewer. 
Suddenly, their eyes watch me as I 
navigate this dreamscape. The fan-
tasy I’ve constructed fractures as 
their inescapable gaze permeates my 
thoughts. The top and bottom rows 
of my teeth slowly clench together 
so hard they grind down my enam-
el. My sweat-infused, water-based 
eyeliner cascades down the space 
between my epicanthic eye folds 
and my nose bridge. My words lodge 
themselves inside my trachea, and in 
my gasps for oxygen, blood fills my 
warm face. My heart swells until I 
can feel it pounding in my fingertips 
like it wants to break free. When I 
awake from my daydreams, their 
smiling faces appear in my night-
mares instead.

I want to rant to you about these 

feelings, but I can’t because you’re 
not really real. The hypothetical 
“you” in this piece, my chance-
encounter dream boy, is just that — a 
dream. On the other hand, homopho-

bia is hyperreal. It looms above me 
at all times, especially when I start 
thinking about the future. For many, 
Queer love is often a transaction, 
forcing us to surrender parental 
love for romance. The power imbal-
ance for young Queer people always 
results in an unequal trade, espe-
cially when our heterosexual coun-
terparts never need to relinquish 
much of anything. Furthermore, it 
places undue pressure on the success 
of the relationship; what happens if 
I come out and am exiled from my 
family only for some shitty Tinder 
boy to ghost me tomorrow? In order 
to destroy these vivid future anxiet-
ies of inescapable familial confron-
tation, I must construct even more 
detailed fantasy worlds as a defense 
mechanism. It is unrealistic for me 
to expect to run into my ideal part-
ner in the grocery store aisle, which 
is precisely the reason I hold on to 
my phantasmal musings of love. If I 
set my criteria for romance so high, I 
never need to worry about the future 
because I’ll never have one with you.

When I return from class or the 

grocery store or wherever I see you 
in passing, the pile of dishes fester-
ing inside my sink is the only thing 
waiting for me at home. Once I turn 
on the faucet, I let the running water 
engulf my hand, slipping in between 
the finest ridges and notches of my 
fingertips. As I scrub down chicken 
karaage residue and tomato paste 
stains, I wish you were beside me, 
drying the dishes as I hand them to 
you. I wish we had eaten out of these 
bowls and tossed fried ramen in this 
frying pan together. I wish we were 
just coming home from class or the 
grocery store or wherever we met 
up, walking hand in hand all the way 
back.

In the middle of my daydreaming, 

I don’t even notice the rising water 
temperature until my scalded skin 
becomes red. Instinctively, my left 
hand turns on the cold water and 
holds my writhing right hand under 
the stream. My fingertips, pressed 
together in pain, rub against my 
cracked, dry knuckles, embracing 
each other until the aching subsides. 
Even within this piece, I had tricked 
myself into thinking that you, my 
imaginary lover, could ever protect 
me. In truth, there is no escaping 
omnipresent homophobia. It invades 
and corrupts every inch of my mind, 
and I keep trying to construct new 
barriers to run deeper and deeper 
into my own ideal world. Life is too 
short to continue evading love and 
its consequences.

Queer love comes with strife but 

I must allow the pain to wash over 
me in order to embrace the warmth 
within the anguish. Even on the 
precipice of catastrophe, hypotheti-
cally rejected by both familial and 
romantic relationships, I will only 
have my own hand to hold. Leaning 
over my sink, with my hands clasped 
together as if in prayer, I let you go.

“suck my dick” men will say phallic 
phrases like “on his ass” as a meta-
phor for berating someone. The fre-
quently uttered, “F— you” carries 
with it an ironically ambiguous, 

obvious yet often obscured notion 

of eroticism. In the undertones of 
what’s uttered is the staggering asso-
ciation of penetration with weakness 
and fragility. These phrases falsely 
equate sexual passivity and penetra-
tion as an inherently punitive subju-
gation.

Deconstructing the ironic eroti-

cism of male heterosexuality allows 
us to see how the social construction 
of sexuality in our society has played 
out along rigid patriarchal lines. It 
also enables us to see the homo-soci-
ality embedded in everyday male cul-
ture that is often expressed in such 
ways that eschew authentic intimacy. 
Sexuality remains much more com-
plex than our culture is willing to 
confess. From the physical and literal 
to the figurative and metaphorical, 
we should do more to divulge in dis-
course on our every-day sexuality. In 
doing so, we can gradually unravel 
the unruly formations of patriarchal 
power for good.

“Paradoxically, the 
embodied desire for 
heteronormativity 

depends upon 
homosocial 

relations that in 

turn often manfest 

homoerotic and 
even homosexual 

desires and 
behaviors”

“Sexuality 

remains much 
more complex 

than our culture 

is willing to 

confess.”

t has been almost two years 
since March 13, 2020. Almost 
two years of not seeing loved 

ones, wearing masks, quarantining, 
testing, vaccinating, mandating and 
sanitizing. Almost two years and 
it’s difficult to think of a time when 
the COVID-19 pandemic will not be 
involved in every aspect of our lives. 
After these two years, many wonder 
when there will be a time their 
efforts to protect themselves and 
their community from this disease 
will lessen. 

As 
COVID 
cases 
decrease 

nationwide, some states — most 
notably, the state of California — 
have begun to consider COVID-19 
as endemic. Shifting to endemicity 
does not, as we might hope, 
entail removing all coronavirus 
restrictions and returning back to 
our pre-pandemic lives. Instead, it 
means reorienting our minds, our 
resources and our public health 
policy towards approaching COVID-
19 as a long-term issue. 

A pandemic, which is what we 

have referred to COVID-19 as for 
roughly the last two years, is a 
rapidly and unpredictably spreading 
disease that infects a wide and 
diverse range of people. COVID-
19 has infected every continent, 
illustrating its reach and labeling it 
a pandemic. An endemic disease, 
which is what many states are 
beginning to consider COVID-19, 
is one whose spread is predictable 
and consistent and whose reach is 
limited to a certain area. While a 
disease becoming endemic does not 
mean that all infection and death 
ceases, it does mean shifting toward 
treating it as a consistent issue to 
mitigate, and not an imminent threat 
to mobilize against.

As we come to terms with COVID-

19’s long-lasting effects, it is vital that 
the federal government provide 
at-home test kits, KN95 masks and 
over-the-counter medications to 
reduce the severity of the disease 
for those who still become infected. 
The pandemic exposed how grossly 
underprepared the United States 
was for combating a widespread 
disease outbreak, to the point where 
even Robert Redfield, then-Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
director, acknowledged it all the 
way back in August 2020. Masks and 
tests were scarce, and the vaccine 
distribution was insufficient to 
prevent the further spread of the 

disease and the emergence of new 
variants. If new variants pop up, 
we should be adequately prepared 
to quickly equip ourselves with the 
necessary preventative measures. 

Awarding 
domestic 

manufacturers with federal dollars 
so they continue producing a robust 
supply of tests, masks and antiviral 
drugs will be the cornerstone 
of effective endemic policy. One 
of the best ways that the federal 
government can incentivize states 
to shift to this endemic focus is by 
awarding states grants to beef up 
PPE manufacturing, accumulate 
vaccine and mask reserves and 
continue to encourage vaccination 
for those who are eligible. 

As we shift to an endemic 

stage, the importance of data 
cannot be undermined. Recently, 
it surfaced that the CDC was not 
fully disclosing all the data on 
COVID-19 
hospitalizations 
and 

wastewater surveillance it had 
collected throughout the pandemic. 
Although 
CDC 
officials 
cited 

concerns about releasing potentially 
inaccurate information, they have 
since received funding intended to 
improve their ability to collect and 
disseminate information in a timely 
and accurate manner. States and 
localities would benefit immensely 
from greater access to a state-of-
the-art 
wastewater 
surveillance 

database. Receiving that data in 
real-time would allow jurisdictions 
to quickly modify public health 
policy in case of an outbreak and 
delimit those measures for the 
region in which the outbreak occurs. 
Moreover, communicating accurate 
data to the public could help rebuild 
public confidence in our medical 
institutions. 

Some of the recent moves by 

state governments to end mask 
and vaccination mandates seem to 
convey the message that “endemic” 
means “stop trying.” Indoor masking 
requirements for vaccinated persons 
have expired in jurisdictions such 
as California, Illinois, New York 
and Washington, D.C. Masking 
requirements in K-12 schools are 
also being lifted. Compare that 
to 
California 
Governor 
Gavin 

Newsom’s SMARTER plan, which 
is intended to treat COVID-19 as a 
permanent part of life — allowing 
people a sense of normalcy without 
becoming vulnerable to future 
COVID-19 variants. Newson’s plan 
includes stockpiling millions of 
masks, continuing to encourage 
vaccination and the development of 
treatments.

Treatments in particular are key 

to a safe future. The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration approved one 
antiviral drug for adults and issued 
emergency authorization for others. 
Pfizer’s oral COVID-19 treatment, 
Paxlovid, was in short supply in 
the months after its emergency 
authorization. 
The 
federal 

government should play a central 
role in encouraging the development 
of more COVID-19 treatments and 
ensuring that those treatments are 
widely available throughout the 
country. A large federal effort akin 
to Operation Warp Speed could help 
the states transition to an endemic 
stage without risking thousands of 
lives. 

Additionally, one major factor 

in ensuring that COVID-19 can 
remain an endemic disease is 
ensuring that countries around the 
world receive an adequate number 
of vaccines. A concerning number 
of the world’s largest countries 
have vaccination rates far below 
the percentage that could provide 
herd immunity. Should this state 
of affairs continue, more variants, 
including 
potentially 
vaccine-

resistant ones, have the potential to 
persist. This is because variants are 
far more likely to emerge when the 
virus is able to spread, and the virus 
is more likely to spread through 
unvaccinated individuals. 

As a wealthy country with a 

higher-than-average 
vaccination 

rate, the United States has the ability, 
and a moral obligation, to improve 
the vaccination rates of other 
countries. An easy way to begin that 
task would be to donate excess doses 
to said countries. While the U.S. has, 
as of March 6, donated around 413.7 
million doses of the vaccine to other 
countries, that number is minute 
compared to the nearly 3 billion 
people around the world that have 
yet to receive even one dose of the 
vaccine.

While there may not be sweeping 

policy changes to be made, moving 
into an endemic state will require a 
revised mindset and long-term shift. 
Treating COVID-19 as endemic, 
and thus returning to relative 
normalcy, means being prepared 
to quash future outbreaks quickly. 
That requires a large and easily 
accessible supply of masks, tests and 
treatments and ensuring that the 
entire world, not just its wealthiest 
countries, is adequately vaccinated. 
Endemicity doesn’t mean giving up 
— it means being prepared to ensure 
that COVID-19 never again becomes 
a pandemic.

From The Daily: Focus on 
COVID-19 as an endemic

W

ith 
the 
winter 

semester still in its 
infancy, my friend 

and I were on the lookout for 
fun things to do on campus. 
Consequently, we bought tickets 
to the TEDx event hosted by the 
University of Michigan. TED 
is an organization that invites 
individuals from across the 
world to give talks about “ideas 
worth 
spreading.” 
A 
TEDx 

event is organized completely 
by an independent body, like 
the University of Michigan, but 
is still affiliated with the now 
world-renowned brand. Both 
my friend and I had grown up 
at schools where our teachers 
would often use TED Talks as 
educational material, so it didn’t 
take too much to convince us to 
buy tickets when we found out 
that the University was going to 
have its own TEDx. The night 
we bought the tickets, we also 
made a pact — one day, both of 
us would give a TED Talk of our 
own.

After buying the tickets, I 

began looking into the details of 
the event. This year’s theme was 
‘shatterproof’, which I thought 
was pretty cool. I knew what 
the word meant, but sometimes 
I like looking up words I know 
to see how they’re officially 
defined. I typed ‘shatterproof’ 
into the search bar and Google 
defined it as: “constructed of 
material that resists shattering.” 
I didn’t find that particularly 
useful — my teachers had always 
told me that a word, in any shape 
or form, should never be used in 
its own definition. 

Fast forward to the day of 

the event, the event organizers 
provided the audience with their 
own definition of ‘shatterproof’ 
right before the first speaker 

was introduced. They referred 
to it as “the ability to withstand 
adversity and not fall apart.” I 
liked that definition more. To 
me, it captured the core essence 
of the word — being able to fight 
against the odds and come out 
stronger. 

Four speakers — a professor 

of environmental science, a 
producer, an engineer turned 
filmmaker and a senior in 
the field of social sciences — 
came and went. As the crowd 
dispersed for a brief intermission 
before the next four speakers, 
I found myself still digesting 
what each speaker had said. 
Although I enjoyed listening to 
all of them, there was one thing I 
just didn’t get: for the most part, 
these talks didn’t really seem to 
revolve around the idea of being 
shatterproof. However, they did 
have one message in common, 
and it was one that I rather liked. 
They focused on the idea that 
everybody, be it an individual 
or a community, has a story to 
share and that story deserves to 
be heard. 

For some of these speakers, 

like Thomas Laub, stories are 
a way of taking a lesson or a 
message and converting it into 
something that can be shared. 
He believes that stories have 
the ability to hold a mirror 
up 
to 
society 
and 
portray 

some harsh truths, while also 
providing an escape when times 
get tough. Razi Jafri implored 
the audience to be mindful 
and to seek authentic artists 
and storytellers, because each 
community deserves to be seen 
with truth, nuance and respect. 
Finally, LSA senior Becca Wong 
made it clear that you are in 
control of your story and that 
you are a lot more than the 
stereotypes and labels society 
tries to put on you. 

Having started her speech by 

comparing herself to a phoenix, 

she ended with the phrase, “You 
can never put the flame out,” 
suggesting that no matter how 
hard others might try, her story 
and her journey will live on. And 
that’s when it hit me.

The amazing thing about TED 

Talks is that they give people a 
chance to share their stories — 
stories of how they overcame 
adversity and fulfilled all their 
dreams. The story of how they 
moved halfway across the world 
to pursue a career in dance, in 
the case of Dr. Fangfei Miao, 
or how they went from losing 
a leg to cancer at the age of 13 
to becoming a paralympic gold 
medalist in the case of Sam 
Grewe. I have always been a 
huge advocate of the idea that 
stories are one of the best, if 
not the best, ways to document 
one’s journey through life. With 
stories, we can show the lessons 
we’ve learned, the values we live 
by, the journey we have been on 
and the people we’ve met. With 
stories we can decide how we 
are remembered, because, as 
novelist Salley Vickers once said, 
“Stories are all we humans have 
to make us immortal.” 

By the time all eight speakers 

had given their talks, this idea 
had been ingrained in me: it is 
our stories that are shatterproof. 
If we are able to share real, 
authentic stories with the world, 
there’s nothing anybody can 
do to tear them down. There is 
no better way to express our 
emotions — love, friendship, 
kindness — than with stories. 
There is no better way to share 
our 
experiences 
than 
with 

stories. As my friend and I 
walked out of the auditorium 
that 
day, 
we 
repeated 
the 

promise we had made earlier 
with renewed vigor. We both 
will give a TED Talk one day. 
And if we don’t, we are certain 
that, one way or another, our 
story will still be told.

A shatterproof material we all own

THE MICHIGAN DAILY 

EDITORIAL BOARD 

O

ver a recent weekend, I 
found myself with some 
spare time and decided to 

pick up “The President Is Missing,” 
a novel co-written by former 
President Bill Clinton and seasoned 
author James Patterson. I had 
some doubts about the story while 
reading the early chapters, but the 
novel, a political thriller published in 
2018, turned out to be an incredibly 
suspenseful 
page-turner 
packed 

with remarkable insights into the 
American presidency.

While a work of fiction, Clinton 

and 
Patterson’s 
gripping 
novel 

sheds light on a real-world danger 
that threatens our entire country 
every day: cybersecurity. In the 
nearly four years that have passed 
since “The President Is Missing” 
hit bookshelves, the invisible cyber 
threat lurking behind our computer 
screens has only deepened. In a world 
where living without phones and 

the internet is virtually impossible, 
the fictional cyber crisis depicted 
in the book felt all too realistic. As 
cyberattacks become increasingly 
common 
with 
technological 

advances, it’s time our leaders devote 
more attention to addressing our 
digital vulnerabilities.

Anyone following the headlines 

knows that the cyber threat is at the 
top of the minds of business owners, 
government officials and everyday 
Americans around the country. 
And for good reason. In recent 
years, cybercriminals have grown 
increasingly sophisticated, turning 
to tactics that make attacks harder to 
detect and mitigate.

A 2020 report from Microsoft 

focusing 
on 
the 
cyber 
threat 

warns of a dramatic “leap in attack 
sophistication.” Just last year, the U.S. 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Agency (CISA), a division of the 
Department of Homeland Security, 
reported 
an 
alarming 
uptick 

“in 
sophisticated, 
high-impact 

ransomware 
incidents 
against 

critical infrastructure organizations 

globally.” In the U.S. in 2021, only two 
of 16 critical infrastructure sectors 
were left unscathed by cyberattacks, 
with industries related to defense, 
emergency services and agriculture 
all being hit by cybercriminals. 

Last May, a massive ransomware 

attack took a major oil pipeline 
running along the East Coast offline, 
leading to headaches and long 
waits at the gas pump for millions 
of drivers. The attack, which is 
believed to be the largest against oil 
infrastructure in American history, 
went unresolved for days until the 
pipeline’s operator — the Colonial 
Pipeline Company — paid more than 
$4 million in ransom to the hackers. 
Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert 
and researcher, called the closure 
“a definite alarm bell,” telling 
Politico the incident was “the most 
significant, successful attack on 
energy infrastructure we know of 
in the United States.” And in recent 
days, some officials have begun 
making preparations for possible 
Russian cyberattacks against the 
U.S. as tensions over Ukraine soar.

Cyberattacks may often be short-

term nuisances that are resolved 
with little disruption. But in an era 
where everything is dependent upon 
technology — from our hospitals, 
water supply and electrical grid to 
our banks and schools — the most 
basic services millions rely on could 
be compromised on a minute’s notice. 
A sophisticated, widespread attack 
launched by cyberterrorists could 
precipitate 
massive 
disruptions, 

shuttering critical systems and 
putting millions of people in danger. 
While this kind of catastrophic 
scenario is perhaps a bit far-fetched 
by some measures, the latest moves 
by attackers on the web demonstrate 
that America needs to be ready for 
anything.

A good first step to fortify 

our cyber defenses would be 
directing more time and money 
toward addressing this startling 
threat. President Joe Biden has 
already made cybersecurity “a top 
priority” for his administration, 
devoting more federal resources to 
confront cyberattacks. But these 

increases in funding for cyber 
defense aren’t enough. Retired 
Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, 
Senior Director of the Center on 
Cyber and Technology Innovation, 
wrote that “the government will 
have to maintain this double-digit 
growth (in cybersecurity spending) 
for several years if it is to have the 
resources it needs to deal with cyber 
threats.” The U.S. government has 
over $30 trillion in debt and needs 
to spend more carefully than ever. 
But if there’s one priority that 
needs to be funded generously, it’s 
cybersecurity. With cyber warfare 
now a distinct possibility both at 
home and abroad, it’s imperative 
America 
has 
strong 
defenses, 

whether that be on land and sea or 
in cyberspace. 

Congress also has more work to 

do on confronting the cyber threat. 
On a recent visit to the University 
of Michigan’s Flint campus, Sen. 
Gary Peters, D-Mich., detailed new 
legislation he introduced on the 
Senate floor that would improve 
the 
reporting 
of 
cyberattacks. 

If 
passed, 
the 
Strengthening 

American Cybersecurity Act would 
“require 
critical 
infrastructure 

owners and operators and civilian 
federal agencies to report to the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) if they 
experience a substantial cyber-
attack,” 
according 
to 
a 
press 

release from Peters’s office. Peters 
— who serves as the chair of the 
Senate Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee — 
said these “efforts will significantly 
bolster 
and 
modernize 
federal 

cybersecurity 
as 
new, 
serious 

software vulnerabilities continue to 
be discovered.” It’s critical Congress 
passes bills like these if we want to 
stand strong against the cyber threat 
and be prepared for any attacks that 
come our way.

As the digital world continues to 

evolve at a breakneck pace, ensuring 
America has what it needs to defend 
itself in cyberspace is more crucial 
than ever. Strengthening our cyber 
defenses must be a top priority as we 
navigate this emerging threat.

Bolstering our cyber defenses should be a top priority

M

asks, and the mask 
mandates 
that 
often 

come along with them, 

have been a flashpoint of contention 
for close to two years. They have 
become 
extremely 
politicized, 

often seen as a quick indicator of 
ideological 
allegiance. 
Policies 

legislating these mandates have 
been the opposite of uniform, 
with laws varying not only state 
by state, but city by city and often 
school district by school district. 
America is at the point where 
governmental policy surrounding 
masks, specifically for children 
younger than 12, ought to be 
uniform. With emerging data on the 
reality of COVID-19 infections in 
schools, readily available vaccines 
and a notable decrease in COVID-
19 cases, the sound policy is clear. 
It is time to do away with mask 
mandates for kids in schools.

I must preface this all by stating 

unequivocally that this is not from 
an anti-mask, or even a blanket anti-
mask-mandate, 
standpoint. 
The 

data is clear that well-fitted medical-
grade masks are extremely effective 
in slowing the spread of COVID-19. 
Moreover, mandates have at many 
times been sound policy. Mask 
mandates were unfortunately quite 

necessary before the widespread 
distribution of the various COVID-
19 vaccines. This piece is not meant 
to diminish the pandemic that has 
taken the lives of over 900 thousand 
people in the U.S. alone. Rather, 
this call is centered around cost-
benefit analysis in tandem with new 
information on COVID infections 
in schools, a changing environment 
and comparative policy with other 
venues where people socialize — 
such as bars and restaurants. 

On Feb. 14, Washington, D.C. 

Mayor Muriel Bowser announced 
that the city would soon be ending 
its vaccination requirement for 
indoor businesses, along with the 
vast majority of mask mandates. 
No 
longer 
would 
masks 
be 

required in restaurants, sports 
and entertainment venues, gyms, 
churches and the vast majority 
of other indoor locations, with 
few 
exceptions. 
Unfortunately, 

one of those lone exceptions was 
for schools. Indeed, six-year-olds 
sitting in class for eight hours a 
day would be bound to wearing 
a mask, while grown adults were 
free to rip off the mask in crowded 
bars. Indoor stadiums packed with 
tens of thousands? No mask. But 
for those little kids comparatively 
spread out in their classroom of 20, 
the burden was still there.

Though I fully support the 

loosening of restrictions, for Bowser 

to stop at schools in the way she 
did is nothing short of infuriating, 
and it defies science. This follows 
a nationwide trend, one which we 
should be deeply worried about. 
Children in this cohort have been 
proven to be less susceptible to 
severe infection and death from 
COVID-19 than every other age 
group. Every kid five years and 
over has safe and extraordinarily 
effective vaccines readily available. 
Schools do not have the density 
that venues like large concerts and 
sporting events do. These factors 
alone make decisions like Bowser’s 
terribly misguided, and furthermore 
should be reason enough to drop the 
mandates entirely, regardless of their 
presence in other localities. 

Most kids in schools are wearing 

cloth 
masks, 
which 
with 
the 

emergence of Omicron have been 
rendered almost if not entirely 
useless. Little kids often struggle 
to keep a mask on their faces, and it 
can be extremely hard for teachers 
to enforce. One-way masking is 
effective, so those who cannot be 
vaccinated, or who have insanely 
decided not to get vaccinated, 
still have the means to protect 
themselves regardless. COVID-19 
cases have absolutely plummeted, 
dropping 90% since January. Lastly, 
and 
maybe 
most 
importantly, 

data are beginning to show quite 
clearly that there is a real adverse 

effect to masking of kids in schools. 
Psychological effects are real, and 
aspects like brain development can 
be hindered. Personal interaction 
is more difficult, and kids often 
struggle to remember faces in 
schools, lack emotional connections 
and more. Academic issues — for 
example, the inability to read lips for 
kids learning language — also exist. 

Moreover, the net benefit of 

mandatory masking for little kids in 
schools has never been consistently 
clear. In fact, the World Health 
Organization explicitly discourages 
masking those five and under, 
and they make a point for those 
aged 6-11 that it should be decided 
on based on relevant data at the 
time. At this time, the information 
sided against mandating masks for 
children in schools.

 As a recent Atlantic article also 

pointed out, the extremely few 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention studies they have long 
used as the crux of their argument 
for mandatory masking in schools 
have serious flaws, to the point 
where their conclusions are only 
vaguely, if at all, supported by their 
own data. Take, for example, that 
one of their studies found masking 
teachers to cause a statistically 
significant decrease in COVID 
transmissions. The same could not 
be demonstrated for students. Or 
the one in Arizona, which did not 

account for vaccinations. Some 
schools in the sample weren’t even 
open, and specific case counts were 
not even collected. There have been 
a total of zero randomized trials 
looking at the efficacy of masking 
with children.

One of the main problems 

government officials and health 
agencies have had throughout the 
pandemic is their lack of a clear 
barometer for when measures need 
to be taken and when they can be 
relaxed. Off ramps — conditions 
that need to be met before the 
relaxation of measures — are vague, 
if not nonexistent. When mandates 
are reimposed, for example, when 
a new variant emerges where 
early data is worrisome and its full 
effects may not be known, or when 
cases spike up drastically, they 
have been based on the emerging 
data. The inverse has not been true. 
Municipalities are often reluctant 
to meaningfully relax measures 
after a wave of COVID has passed, 
instead leaving their — largely 
vaccinated — citizens to languish in 
the precautions of last year’s surge.

As Dr. Leana Wen pointed out, 

when you continue to impose the 
same ‘red alert’-like restrictions, 
and those restrictions are not 
loosened when new data emerges, 
you 
lose 
leverage 
to 
impose 

restrictions when they are actually 
needed most down the line. We 

are in a clear position of vast 
improvement, 
where 
masking 

needs to be loosened, especially for 
little kids in schools, who are safest 
from COVID-19 and yet face the 
most adverse effects of constant 
masking. 

Compared to many, younger kids 

have had an especially hard time 
dealing with the societal effects of 
COVID-19. The lack of in-person 
schooling, interaction with kids their 
age and unwarranted restrictions 
in which they often bear more 
responsibility than any other age 
group has been deeply damaging. 
The 
hypocrisy 
of 
school 
and 

government leaders who continue 
to implement mask mandates in 
schools, then themselves do not 
follow those rules, is insulting to the 
very kids they claim they care about. 

When masking is not required 

for large indoor events like concerts 
and 
sporting 
events, 
where 

individuals are much more tightly 
packed than kids in schools and 
in all likelihood are composed of 
more vulnerable age groups, it is 
insulting to kids who must still 
endure the restrictions. Adults, who 
should have no problem keeping a 
mask on all day, who do not suffer 
the same sort of psychological 
and learning effects of masks, are 
free of restrictions. Kids, the most 
vulnerable population to mandatory 
masking, are not. 

D

ear 
Elizabeth, 
I’m 

struggling. 
One 
of 

my best guy friends 

has 
recently 
been 
making 

some 
homophobic 
comments 

that are not hateful but are 
clearly rooted in some sort of 
discomfort with sexuality as a 
whole. I don’t want to push him 
to talk about it but I feel like 
its something that is making 
everyone uncomfortable — a lot 
of our friends have also pointed 
it out — and I want him to be 
able to talk it through and grow 
in a healthy way. Do you think 
it’s my/our place to address 
this? – S ’22 (He/him)

Hello! I think this is a 

common issue people have 
with their friends and knowing 
when it is or isn’t their place 
to say something. It can be 
uncomfortable 
to 
confront 

a friend and start a serious 
conversation 
with 
them. 

However, if you start the 
conversation from a place of 
wanting to talk through the 
problem, then you can get 
your point across in a healthy 
and productive way. It may 
be hard for your friend to not 
be 
immediately 
defensive, 

so I recommend reminding 

them that you know it is not 
on purpose and that their 
intentions are not to cause harm 
or tear apart their character. 
Overall, I think you/any of the 
other friends that have noticed 
this issue would be helping this 
person out by stepping in and 
expressing the discomfort their 
comments can cause because 
otherwise those comments will 
continue to make more people 
uncomfortable or have greater 
harmful impacts. 

I have a crush on someone 

on my project team. Is it ok to 
ask them out even if we work 
closely together? – A ’22 (He/
him)

Great question! I think that if 

the project is temporary, then it 
would be best to ask closer to 
the end of the project or when 
it is over so that if something 
does go poorly, it doesn’t impact 
the work or work environment. 
However, if it is a long-term 
project and you are picking up 
signals that they are interested 
as well, you could ask them to 
do something more casual like 
coffee or lunch and take it from 
there! 

I’m a sophomore in college 

and I’ve never dated or been 
in a relationship. I am not in 
any hurry really for something 
serious but I feel like everyone 
around me is always talking 

about dating, hooking up, or 
their 
significant 
other. 
But 

I don’t really know or am 
friends with any guys and I 
am too afraid to use a dating 
app because I just want a nice 
wholesome guy. So I need advice 
on how to meet guys when I 
don’t really interact with many 
and how to get into the “dating 
world.” – K ’24 (She/her)

Thank you for writing in, I 

have a lot of friends in college 
who 
have 
struggled 
with 

this same problem! It can be 
hard to meet new people once 
everyone is in their routine. I 
recommend joining new clubs 
or sitting next to new people 
in 
class 
and 
introducing 

yourself! Most of the college 
relationships I know started in 
class, through dorms or mutual 
friends. I also recommend not 
putting too much pressure 
on yourself to have a ton of 
dating experiences in college. 
Everyone has different levels 
of experience and it doesn’t 
mean you are behind just 
because you haven’t dated 
anyone seriously yet. I am a 
firm believer that the best 
things happen when you least 
expect it, so I would join 
clubs and events that you are 
interested in for yourself and 
then if you meet somebody 
through it, it’s a plus!

across the country to take one of 
several special exams. The stakes 
are high. Students who perform 
well on these exams might earn a 
coveted seat at one of their city’s 
selective 
public 
high 
schools. 

Graduates of these schools go 
on to matriculate at top colleges 
and universities, including the 
University of Michigan. Research 
from The Daily found that in 2019 a 
significant number of out-of-state 
freshmen came from several of 
these schools: Bronx Science and 
Brooklyn Tech in New York City; 
Lane Tech and Walter Payton in 
Chicago; Thomas Jefferson High 
School for Science and Technology 
in Alexandria, Virginia. 

Selective public high schools 

(SHSs) are some of the best public 
schools in the country. They 
provide an extraordinary catalog of 
instructional and extracurricular 
resources, create spaces for high-
caliber students to learn and 
socialize with one another and are 
considered a foothold for upward 
economic 
mobility, 
especially 

among 
working-class, 
Asian-

American immigrant households. 
They also admit a small number 
of Black and Hispanic kids — 
Chicago Public Schools’ system is 
the only slight outlier. Stuyvesant 
High School in New York City, for 
example, admitted only eight Black 
students in 2021 out of 749 spots, 
even though Black students make 
up 26% of NYC’s public school 
system. 

Initiatives 
to 
increase 
the 

number of Black and Hispanic 
students attending SHSs have been 
numerous and often politically 
controversial. 
Bill 
de 
Blasio, 

former New York City mayor, tried 
unsuccessfully to eliminate the 
entrance exam at several of NYC’s 
schools in 2019. New Yorkers 
pushed back forcefully against the 
idea, killing de Blasio’s hopes for 
the New York Legislature to pass 
the measure. 

In 2020, Thomas Jefferson 

High School for Science and 
Technology 
instituted 
a 
new 

merit-based lottery admissions 
system. The school eliminated its 
entrance exam, began considering 
applicants’ socioeconomic status 
and mandated that at least 1.5% of 
students from each middle school 
in the region be admitted. As a 
consequence of the policy, the 
racial composition of the current 
freshman 
class 
is 
markedly 

different than previous years. 
The percentage of Asian students 
admitted decreased from 73% to 
54%. With respect to economic 
diversity, 
25% 
of 
students 

offered a spot were classified as 
economically 
disadvantaged. 

Notably, the average GPA of 
the newest class did not change 
significantly. 

That last item did not seem 

important to the community, 
however. Outcry at the first 
consequence 
was 
swift 
and 

serious: a group of parents quickly 
filed a lawsuit alleging that the 
policy 
unfairly 
discriminated 

against Asian students. In a 
similar series of events, three San 
Francisco school board members 
were recalled last week, due in 
part to the new merit-based lottery 
admissions system put in place at 
their district’s SHS, Lowell High 
School. 

I find myself agreeing with the 

parents’ arguing against lottery 
systems, to an extent. The issue at 
stake is similar to the one raised 
in Students for Fair Admissions v. 
President and Fellows of Harvard 
College, at least with respect to 
the relationship between Asian 
students and admissions to elite 
schools. Using data on New York 
City’s SHSAT as a proxy, Asian 
students are more likely to take 
the SHSAT and perform better 
on it than other racial groups, as 
evidenced by the higher number of 
enrollment offers they receive. 

Admissions 
criteria 
that 

devalue test scores are implicitly 
discriminating 
against 
Asian 

students. In New York, Census 
data shows Asians have the lowest 
median income in the city, and 
therefore do not, by default, have 
an unfair economic advantage over 
the students who would benefit 
from the policy change.

A partial explanation for the 

success of Asian students in NYC 
are the grueling test prep classes 
their parents are more likely to 
enroll them in to prepare for the 
SHSAT. That, to me, indicates that 
even if Asian students perform 
better on tests, the means by which 
they do so are drastic. It shows 
that the education system is failing 
these students just as poorly as 
students who don’t suffer through 
test prep classes and score lower. 
As I wrote in an earlier column, 
America’s 
hyper-fixation 
on 

testing tends to crowd out other 
conversations about our education 
system and about other proposals 
to improve it.

The argument on behalf of 

reforming SHS admissions rests 
on two main planks: one, that the 
reformed system would increase 
the number of Black and Hispanic 
high-achieving, low-SES students 
at SPHSs, and two, that these 
students 
would 
benefit 
from 

attending these schools. TJHSST 
and Lowell High School support 
the first claim. The number of Black 
and Hispanic students at both 
schools 
increased 
immediately 

after the merit lotteries were 
introduced. 

The second is less clear. A 

study conducted by researchers 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Minneapolis 
found 
negligible 

differences in academic outcomes 
between students who fell just 
under or just above the cutoff 
score to get into Chicago’s SHSs. 
Distressingly, the GPAs of students 
who barely made the cutoff were 

ultimately lower. The authors 
qualify this finding with the fact 
that GPA measures achievement 
somewhat 
relative 
to 
other 

students, but even so, that evidence 
suggests academic gains for these 
students are marginal, if anything. 
Competing against students who 
come from better backgrounds 
shifts students who don’t lower 
in the grade distribution, as one 
would expect. They did find, 
however, that students at SHSs felt 
safer and more respected. They 
also generally reported a higher 
level of well-being. 

A separate study examining low-

achieving middle school students 
in New York City found that these 
students preferred to attend high 
schools that were geographically 
closer, rather than schools with 
the highest reported educational 
outcomes. I interpret those findings 
to mean that families and students 
balance considerations beyond just 
academics. The physical burden of a 
long commute to another school and 
the emotional tax of transitioning to 
an unfamiliar social environment 
are weighty concerns. 

We would like to imagine that 

institutions such as selective public 
high schools are one of the last 
few bastions of equal opportunity 
in this country and therefore 
inviolable. The belief that entrance 
exams serve as an impartial, 
even somewhat moral, sorting 
mechanism is difficult to challenge. 
They do rank students efficiently, 
even if students who score lower 
are similarly intelligent to those 
who score higher. Explanations for 
score differentials are numerous, 
however, and mostly not related 
to intelligence. Different levels of 
income, different primary school 
resources, 
non-English 
first 

language and cultural attitudes 
toward test preparation are some 
of the many factors that come into 
play alongside intellect. Putting 
these tests on a pedestal as proof of 
a fair education system is a shallow 
argument. 

A system that forces students 

to put themselves through intense 
mental anguish for the slim chance 
of admittance to a high school 
where attendance requires them 
to leave their community and their 
friends and start over in a new 
environment can have negative 
consequences. They might begin 
to develop imposter syndrome 
because they are, for the first time, 
surrounded by kids who get better 
grades (because those kids went 
to a better middle school); this is 
a bad system. Efforts to reform 
public education should not be 
focused on moving kids to better 
schools, but instead should aim 
to move better schools to kids. 
That will require asking hard 
questions about how we fund 
our public schools. That might 
require resources concentrated in 
SHSs to be distributed, effectively 
destroying the concept of SHSs as 
we view them today. Perhaps that’s 
okay.

INDIANAPOLIS — The No. 10 

Michigan women’s basketball team 
has lost four of its last six games.

It’s time for the Wolverines to 

start worrying.

Worrying about their 

chances of returning to the 
Sweet 16. Worrying about 
their crumbling defense, 
once the team’s backbone. 
Worrying 
about 
their 

struggle to find offensive 
consistency.

Entering the Big Ten 

Tournament, it seemed as 
if Michigan would be hun-
gry for revenge. Dropping 
three of its five last regu-
lar season games — and losing its 
hopes at its first ever regular sea-
son Big Ten Title — should be the 
perfect fuel for a tournament run.

Instead, the Wolverines added 

Nebraska to their growing list of 
losses.

In an inconsistent game, the 

smaller issues plaguing Michigan 
culminated in a heartbreaking 

loss, ending the team’s short-lived 
time in Indianapolis. With the 
same struggles following Michi-
gan through each game, it’s clear 
the Wolverines’ problems run 

deeper than just individ-
ual matchups. 

After Michigan’s win 

over Indiana on Jan. 31, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

on top of the world. 
They were in the driv-
er’s seat in the Big Ten 
and ranked sixth in the 
nation (the best ranking 
in program history); the 
season looked to be all 
Michigan hoped it would 

be. Accomplishing the seniors’ 
career-long goal of winning a Big 
Ten Title seemed within reach. 

Then things came crumbling 

down. 
Two 
stunning 
upsets 

in early February at the hands 
of Michigan State and North-
western — two unranked teams 
— brought Michigan’s champi-
onship hopes into question. And 

after a short run at redemption, 
the Wolverines faltered, falling 
to Iowa in a final bout for the Big 
Ten Title this past Sunday.

Against Nebraska on Friday, 

the result was no different. 

Allowing the Cornhuskers to 

score 20 points or more in three 
quarters, Michigan’s defense — 
which the team has prided itself 
on all season — broke. The Wol-
verines’ offense could not execute 
down the stretch. Their foul trou-
ble allowed Nebraska to make 14 
free throws in the second half. 

“I think our biggest thing is 

our defense,” senior forward Naz 
Hillmon said. “I think that that’s 
one thing that really fueled us 
early in the season, playing teams 
with potent offenses.”

So the natural question is, what 

happened?

Maybe they peaked at the 

wrong time. Maybe they rely on 
Hillmon too much. Maybe their 
end of season schedule was too 
difficult. Maybe they needed 

senior wing Leigha Brown, who 
missed time with a lower leg inju-
ry, to return much earlier.

There’s a million answers 

— and excuses — to that ques-
tion. Most are valid concerns the 
Wolverines must address in the 
upcoming break between now 
and their opening game of the 
NCAA Tournament. After tout-
ing their ability to focus on one 
game at a time, and wanting to 
be the hardest working team in 
America, Michigan needs to hone 
in on its team philosophy now 
more than ever. 

As the fate of their NCAA 

Tournament run hangs in the 
balance, just as their once pos-
sible Big Ten Title once did, it’s 
time for the Wolverines to be con-
cerned about the issues that have 
plagued them down the stretch.

“I think these last couple 

games have exposed the attention 
to detail that we need to have,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “Which we definitely 

have been working on, but when 
everyone’s not out there together, 
I think it’s really important.”

Only proactive solutions based 

on solving the recurring prob-
lems will save Michigan’s season 
from the clutches of defeat. It’s no 
longer enough to move forward 

hoping the issues will iron them-
selves out. Or to maintain that 
things will be OK once Brown 
comes back to full strength. Or to 
hope that the defense will finally 
click. Or that the schedule will get 
easier.

Instead, it’s time to worry.

From unknown to ace, Alex 
Storako’s journey to the top

NOAH KINGSLEY
Daily Sports Writer

Abbie Telgenhof: For Michigan, it’s time to worry

Joey Goodsir: For Michigan, yet 

another regional exit 
would be unacceptable

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 

Alex Storako rose from a lightly-recruited high schooler to a 
Michigan ace.

The Michigan softball team needs to break its postseason slump.

ABBIE 

TELGENHOF

Alex Storako has reached the 

mountaintop. 

At least for a pitcher in the Big 

Ten, that is. The senior right-hand-
er is the reigning Big Ten Pitcher 
of the Year, and her previous cam-
paign was vital to the Michigan 
softball team’s conference title. 

Now, in her senior season, 

expectations are as high as ever. 
Storako is again the Wolverines’ co-
ace alongside fifth-year left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien. Already, with a 
season remaining for both of them, 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
has likened the pair to other pitch-
ing greats of Michigan history. 

“When you speak of Meghan 

and Alex, you put them on the 
same wall as the (former Wolverine 
pitchers) Jenny Ritters and the Jor-
dan Taylors,” Hutchins said prior to 
the season. “They’ve been fantastic 
pitchers; they’ve been top five in 
the NCAA in a bunch of categories, 
and we’re so lucky to have them on 
our team.”

But for Storako, Michigan soft-

ball greatness wasn’t something 
that she could have expected. 

In fact, it was far from it.
Entering her junior season of 

high school, Storako was uncom-
mitted on where she would play 
college softball. She received some 
offers — mostly from smaller 
schools such as DePaul, where she 
initially committed during her 
sophomore year. After transferring 
to Lincoln Way-East High School, 
she immediately became one of the 
most crucial members of the team. 

“About midway through her 

junior year, she found her rhythm,” 
Lincoln-Way East coach Elizabeth 
Hyland said. “She got in her groove 
and it was smooth sailing from 
there. … You look at your pitcher as 
a leader, and during that year’s play-
offs, she really led us.”

Even as Storako put it all togeth-

er on the field, the successes she had 
hoped for didn’t come off it. Offers 
stayed few and far between as she 
continued to fly under the radar of 
larger programs. By season’s end, 

When Duke coach Marissa 

Young presented Michigan soft-
ball coach Carol Hutchins a jar 
of maize and blue M&Ms follow-
ing 
her 
record-setting 

1,675th win, it was a sym-
bolic reflection towards 
softball royalty from her 
high-achieving 
descen-

dants.

But also a reminder of 

the work left to be done in 
the present.

Hutchins’s win came 

in Durham during an 
Ann Arbor reunion two 
weekends ago, as Young 
pitched under Hutchins from 
2000 to 2003. Northern Kentucky 
was also led into the same Duke 
invitational by Kathryn Glea-
son, who was a Michigan captain 
and two-time World Series team 
member in 1995 and 1996.

For someone who always turns 

the credit of milestones towards 
those who played under her, it 
was a fitting first moment with 
Hutchins again becoming the 
sport’s winningest coach of all 
time. But any time the attention 
turns back to her positioning in 
the coaching pantheon, especially 
relative to the coach she passed 
in Arizona legend Mike Candrea, 
one can’t help but read between 
the lines.

“Mike 
Candrea 
has 
eight 

national championships and what 
he has done for the game of soft-
ball, he’s on a level all by himself,” 
Hutchins said. “I will look up to 
him forever. … All we’re trying 
to do is, we’re trying to get to the 
World Series. We’ve been able 
to get to the World Series. As the 
goal of this year’s team is the goal 
of every team. We have to win 
games to do it and that’s my only 
focus, but all I can do is tip my hat 
to Mike Candrea.”

There is certainly not a sane 

voice out there saying Hutchins 
needs to pull seven more national 
titles to prove her on-field great-
ness, nor should there be. But 
comparisons to Candrea’s track 
record in NCAA Regionals — the 

area plaguing the Wolverines the 
most — shed some light on where 
more reasonable frustrations lie:

Candrea made it out of the tour-

nament’s first weekend in 
all but three years in his 
35-year Arizona tenure, 
while Hutchins has only 
managed to do it in about 
half of her 36 years at Mich-
igan.

The 
rate 
has 
most 

recently manifested itself in 
a regional-victory drought 
over the past five years, 
one that has left some of 
the best players in program 

history unsatisfied — and coming 
back to school in order to change 
that.

“There’s a lot of goals that I 

set for myself in each year that I 
haven’t been able to achieve yet,” 
fifth-year left hander Meghan 
Beaubien said in February. “That’s 
a big reason I’m back. I’ve never 
been (to the Women’s College 
World Series), I’ve never made it 
out of the regional, and I’m not 
happy with that. No one who has 
been here for five years is happy 
with that.”

Players like Beaubien are why 

accomplishments 
during 
the 

five-year drought can be taken 
for granted. Led by assistant 
coach Jennifer Brundage, Michi-
gan’s dominance in the circle has 
brought in a steady stream of Big 
Ten championships.

But cold bats, failed execution 

and tough matchups have cut each 
team short in the exact same round 
just as often.

To anyone who has followed 

the Wolverines since their last 
regional breakthrough — its 2016 
Women’s College World Series 
appearance — that recap probably 
feels redundant. It’s on the top of 
all the Wolverines’ mind too, and 
developments this past offseason 
reflect that.

Faith Canfield, a former two-

year captain who played at Michi-
gan from 2016 to 2019, returned 
as a volunteer coach. She batted 
an impressive .390 or better dur-

ing the last three years of her play-
ing career. Choice grad-transfer 
selections from the portal in out-
fielder Kristina Burkhardt and util-
ity player Melina Livingston also 
reflect this push for batting action.

Both transfers sought Michigan 

as a powerhouse destination from 
which to close out their career 
under a legendary coach. But as 
other contenders such as UCLA, 
Oklahoma and Florida stamp the 
World Series as a destination they 
see routinely over the last five 
years, the Wolverines fade behind 
in relevance by not even seeing a 
Super Regional.

Additionally, holding up a role 

as the cream of the Big Ten is no 
longer a given. Sure, the top-heavy 
reality remains, but Northwest-
ern’s loaded start and Minnesota’s 
emergence threaten. While Bur-
khardt leads other new faces in a 
batting boom that provides positive 
momentum into the home opener, 
the quiet lack of returning security 
at the plate from senior outfielder 
Lexie Blair and fifth-year infielder 
Taylor Bump could doom Michi-
gan to hit the same wall once again.

“A lot of it is timing — they need 

at-bats to get it back,” Hutchins 
said. “They definitely need to not 
put the pressure on themselves or 
go to that place of ‘Well, I did good 
last year.’ Last year is over.”

But the collective output, along 

with pitching security led by senior 
right-hander Alex Storako, tal-
lies a win-loss resume that puts 
the Wolverines exactly where 
they want to be. At 13-6 they have 
collected wins over four ranked 
teams, most recently in an 8-0 vic-
tory over No. 10 Kentucky this past 
weekend. More importantly, even 
in the highly-touted matchups lost, 
they’ve remained within reach.

The elite expectations are there, 

the elite mindset is slowly building 
the team to shape. Now, the results 
of an elite program need to follow.

And elite programs can’t get 

bounced from the road to Okla-
homa City on the first stop every 
year. As much as anyone, Hutchins 
knows that.

GRACE BEAL/Daily 

Michigan lost its opening game in the Big Ten Tournament, leaving 
cause for concern as the NCAA Tournament looms.

JOEY 

GOODSIR

Storako remained unsure where 
her softball career would continue. 

But she was unwilling to settle 

for just anything. 

“There was so much maturity 

there,” Hyland said. “She knew 
exactly where her sights were set, 
and she was just gonna go for it. … 
She just wanted to prove herself.”

So, she took a chance. Storako 

remained uncommitted into her 
senior year, and joined the Sparks 
Premier 18U club that fall. On the 
larger club stage, she continued 
her success, and finally, larger pro-
grams started to take a look at her. 

“Going into that year uncommit-

ted, I had the mindset of just enjoy-
ing the moment,” Storako said. “I 
tried to play to my potential and 
have fun, and that led to me per-
forming really well and getting a lot 
of looks from a lot of places.”

By the end of that fall season, 

Storako had done enough to garner 
an offer from Michigan. She soon 
took an official visit and fell in love 
with the program, committing on 
the spot. After exposing herself to 
the possibility of failure, she found 
the success she was looking for, 
becoming the last member of the 
Wolverines’ 2019 recruiting class. 

Upon reaching Michigan, Stor-

ako found herself in uncharted 
territory once again. She came into 
college as a self-acclaimed “raw 
pitcher,” having never worked with 
a true pitching coach. Given the 
opportunity to learn from Michi-
gan pitching coach Jen Brundage, 
she absorbed as much knowledge 
as she could.

Together, Brundage and Storako 

worked to solidify Storako’s poten-
tial, shaping her raw talent with 
Brundage’s deep technical knowl-
edge. Brundage helped Storako 
develop into a pitcher who could 
contribute right away, readying her 
for a rapidly approaching collegiate 
debut. Storako first entered the 
circle for the Wolverines in their 
season opener. She tossed three hit-
less innings, the first of many suc-
cessful outings that year. 

But when Storako looks back at 

those early moments of her fresh-
man season, that success isn’t what 
jumps out at her. 

“My first collegiate start was 

against (then-No. 7) Arizona,” 
Storako recalled. “The most mem-
orable thing about that game was 
when I gave up my first collegiate 
home run to Alyssa Palomino-Car-
doza, who’s now an Olympian. …

“It was just like, ‘Well, welcome 

to the big leagues.’ ”

In reality, that outing against 

the Wildcats was a speed bump 
during an otherwise very strong 
freshman season. Storako finished 
that year with a 2.02 ERA and 190 
strikeouts, and was selected to the 
Big Ten All-Freshman team. It’s a 
testament to the way that Storako 
motivates herself, that in a season 
with so much accomplished, she 
still looks back at the first time she 
couldn’t get the job done. 

At the start of her sophomore 

season, Storako came roaring out 
of the gates once again. Through 
her first 17 appearances, she 
recorded 141 strikeouts in just 75 
innings. But of course, the season 
ended on a poor note, as the begin-
ning of the pandemic brought it to 
an abrupt halt. 

For Storako, that swift ending 

was turned even more bitter by her 
season’s final outing. 

“The last pitch I ever threw 

that season was supposed to be an 
intentional walk,” Storako said. “I 
threw it in the dirt, and we lost in 
extra innings. I think that was a 
very defining pitch in my career. 
… Some of my best friends ended 
their softball career on that pitch.”

That pitch — and the lessons she 

learned from it — propelled Storako 
through the uncertainty surround-
ing the rest of that year. She contin-
ued to work every day to improve, 
knowing that when she did get a 
chance to pitch again, she wouldn’t 
let it slip away. By the time the 2021 
season finally arrived, she had built 
up a massive chip on her shoulder. 

From there, Storako took off. 

She delivered a masterful junior 
campaign, leading the nation in 
strikeouts-per-seven-innings 
while posting a 1.05 ERA. Her 
performance earned her a wide 
array of achievements, from set-
ting Michigan strikeout records to 
a unanimous selection as the Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Year. 

Now, Storako is in the midst 

of the best season of her career. 
Through 11 appearances, she has a 
0.75 ERA and is limiting opponents 
to a .138 batting average. Heading 
into the Wolverines’ home opener, 
she’s coming off her first ever no-
hitter, an eight-inning gem against 
Drake. 

Even as she soars to greater 

heights, Storako still recalls when 
her future in softball was uncer-
tain. 

“Being a small recruit and a late 

add to Michigan, I wasn’t expected 
to make a really big impact,” Stor-
ako said. “Having an impact now, 
years later, I’m grateful for every 
opportunity that comes my way. 
There’s a lot of things that could be 
very different if I chose a different 
path or if things didn’t go a certain 
way.”

So as Storako adds to her ever 

growing mountain of success, the 
foundations hold sturdy to the 
moments where she couldn’t find 
it.

With Dickinson ill, 

Michigan mounts come-
back to shock Ohio State

C

OLUMBUS — sometimes, 
it’s not how you start. 

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team walked into the 
locker room at halftime down by 
seven, a lifeless offensive performance 
making its chances to win the game — 
and make the NCAA Tournament — 
look bleak.

But in the second half, the 

Wolverines surged. The offense found 
its footing, and combined with a 
stellar defensive effort, they garnered 
the sort of performance they needed 
to stun the Buckeyes on their home 
court.

Michigan (17-13 overall, 11-9 

Big Ten) took down No. 23 Ohio 
State (19-10, 12-8), 75-69, in its 
regular season finale, securing a 
huge resumé boost with Selection 
Sunday only a week away. 

“I’m just in awe of the players’ 

character,” acting head coach Phil 
Martelli said. “I’m in awe of the 
support staff’s knowledge.”

There was plenty for Martelli to 

marvel at, especially considering 
the blow the Wolverines were 
dealt before the game even began. 
Just hours before tip, they learned 
that sophomore center Hunter 
Dickinson had been ruled out 
with a stomach ailment. Without 
Dickinson, Michigan knew it 
would be 
nearly impossible 

to make 
up the offensive 
production of its 
premier player. 

Instead, 
it 

turned 
to 
its 

defense 
to 
slow 

down the Buckeyes.
“I 
believe 
that 

when we play as a 

team, no matter who’s missing, 
we’re definitely going to give a 
challenge to any team that we 
play,” freshman forward Moussa 
Diabate said. “We obviously need 
him, but we did what we needed 
to do and it worked out.”

For much of the first half, 

that 
gameplan 
worked. 
The 

Wolverines 
frustrated 
Ohio 

State, generating six steals and 
eight 
offensive 
rebounds 
to 

secure 
extra 
possessions 
for 

an undermanned offense. But 
Michigan couldn’t cash in on 
those extra possessions, as it shot 
a measly 13-for-37 in the first half.

The defense fought tooth and 

nail to keep the game within 
reach, but late in the first half 
cracks 
began 
to 
show. 
The 

Buckeyes finished the final three 
minutes on an 8-2 run, giving the 
Wolverines a 37-30 deficit at the 
break.

A maligned offense now had to 

pull itself out of an even greater 
hole. 

“I was worried,” Martelli said. 

“Because there had been a little 
bit too much engagement with the 
referees. Like we could have come 
off the court whining about zero 
foul shots and that kind of thing.”

But coming out in the second 

half, no one panicked. And the 
shots at last began to fall.

Michigan shored up its interior 

presence 
while 
also 
playing 

aggressive on offense to tie the 
game at 39 coming out of the 
break. Back-to-back triples from 
graduate guard DeVante’ Jones 
shortly after helped Michigan 
surge 
ahead, 
proving 
the 

Wolverines would not go away 
quietly. 

Instead, 
quietness 
hung 

throughout a shell-shocked Value 

City Arena. Michigan continued 
to apply the pressure to Ohio 
State, raining down threes to take 
a 58-49 lead into the under-eight 
timeout. A win that had seemed 
unattainable 
at 
the 
halftime 

buzzer was suddenly very much 
within reach.

“I think the biggest thing in 

the locker room was coming out 
with energy,” sophomore forward 
Terrance Williams II said. “…I 
feel like that was the biggest part 
— and that we stayed together 
throughout Ohio State’s run in 
the end of the first half.”

The Buckeyes, though, kept 

fighting — and the lead at once 
shrunk. They cut a double-
digit margin to six, and as the 
clock ticked under four minutes 
remaining, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

chance to complete the comeback 
was teetering in the balance. 

But the resilience Michigan 

displayed throughout the second 
half continued to shine through.

An emphatic block by Diabate 

with two-and-a-half minutes to 
play maintained a two-possession 
lead for the Wolverines. A clutch 
three from freshman guard Kobe 
Bufkin moments later served as 
the dagger. 

“(Bufkin) raised up like the ball 

was going in,” Martelli said. “And 
not just Kobe, but too many times 
this year, we’ve had guys raise 
up and they hope it’s going in. If 
you’re hoping that a ball is going 
in, don’t shoot it.”

Despite missing its best player, 

despite an ugly first half, despite 
the fact a loss would’ve sunk its 
tournament chances, Michigan 
found a way to win. 

For once in this tumultuous 

season, when the Wolverines 
needed to do so, they finished.

Content warning: Language about violence, school 

shooting. 

November 30, 12:50 p.m.
If you asked, I could recall the day, not like it hap-

pened yesterday, but like it’s happening now. Like I’m 
still stuck in that moment.

I can smell the crisp air. It’s cold, but not that cold. 

I walk to class without having to wear my mask to 
protect my face from the winter wind. I’m on the 
phone with my friend, walking to class, laughing. We 
talked about a story I was writing. It was an ordinary, 
plain day, one I thought I would most likely forget.

But I never will.
As I put back on my mask and walked to class, 

kids an hour and a half away were running. I enter 
my calculus classroom — room 2353, Mason Hall. I 
sit in front of the window and I can see the Diag. It 
still looks like fall, even though it’s late November, 
nearly December. I smile. Maybe this winter will be 
light, I think.

I get the text not even five minutes into my lec-

ture. It was from my dad: 

Active shooter at Oxford High School. We have 

Abbey. 

Abbey is my younger sister, a sophomore who 

was at Oxford High School on that cold-but-not-
cold November afternoon. I didn’t know then, but 
she was down the hall from the shooter and had 

crawled out of the win-
dow after barricading 
the door with the rest of 
her classmates, running 
to the Meijer around the 
corner. She was with my 
parents before I even 
knew what was hap-
pening. It was a relief. 
My sister was safe.

But my best friend 

wasn’t. Not yet.

Her name is Olivia 

— a senior at Oxford 

High School despite only being two months younger 
than me. I sat there, frozen, ignoring the lecture hap-
pening not two feet in front of me. I texted her with 
shaky fingers.

The words I shared with her that day are one of 

the few things I can’t remember about November 30. 
Maybe I chose to forget the terror behind everything 
I said and to forget that feeling I never want to expe-
rience again. All I know is that I told her I loved her.

I waited for every text, hanging on the bubbles on 

my screen. Every minute was more agonizing than 
the last. I knew she had other people to contact, other 
people to say goodbye to — just in case — but I didn’t 
know what was happening. What if the words I had 
sent to her were the last words I’d ever get to say to 
her?

I told her I loved her again. And again. And again, 

for good measure. I told her I loved her until the 
police came to her classroom and escorted her out. I 
told her I loved her until she got to the Meijer parking 
lot. I told her I loved her until she was back at home 
with her family. 

I still can’t believe I’ll be able to say those three 

words to her again. I came closer to the last time than 
I’d ever like to. But I knew that others would never 
be able to say “I love you” again. I knew that my pain 
was a drop in the ocean that was theirs. I couldn’t 
fathom it – couldn’t even begin to comprehend it. 

It was real
I lay in my bed.
After I left my calculus lecture, far too early, I 

met up with my sister. We went to a private place on 
campus and cried. I called my little sister, Abbey. I 
didn’t want to hang up. I was terrified she would slip 
through my fingers like sand, like she almost had.

I was wrapped in the fuzziest blanket I had, try-

ing to comfort myself. I had my tissues beside me. 
My phone was tuned to a local news station. I had 
watched my high school from the outside many 
times — often with a sense of dread as I sat in my car 
in the early morning, before the first-period bell. But 
this time was different. I watched a drone fly high 
over the ceilings I knew so well, I saw the parking lot 
from every angle. Cop cars and ambulances lined the 
streets.

I had spent the last few hours convincing myself 

that this was all somehow a mistake. I knew there 
were idiots at my school — I convinced myself that 
one of them had just crossed the line. That someone, 
in a sick joke, had brought a BB gun to school and pre-
tended to freak all the students out. I had convinced 
myself that the terror was only imagined — that my 
family and my friends were not in any real danger. I 
shielded myself with that fantasy. It was warmer and 
more comforting than any blanket in my dorm.

But it was all a facade. A facade that was about to 

be destroyed.

The event’s press conference was held in a park-

ing lot — the Meijer parking lot where students were

Where do we go from here?
Moving forward after the Oxford tragedy

Content warning: Mentions of gun violence, school 

shooting.

How could this happen here? Why is my high 

school, my hometown, in headlines? I felt utter shock 
and horror seeing my home, which holds the people 
I love and the places I grew up, plastered across the 
media on November 30, 2021.

I felt a sort of willful ignorance as I anxiously 

waited to hear from my loved ones at Oxford High 

School, terrified to learn of the events that unfolded 
in those halls. But, nevertheless, I was desperate to 
know if everyone was safe. 

Within minutes, the headlines changed: “Active 

Shooter at Oxford High School” became “3 killed, 
8 injured in shooting at Oxford High School.” The 
moment that disgusting, heinous individual opened 
fire, my town was forever changed. Within minutes, 
three lives were lost, several people were injured and 

a school of students, 
teachers, 
staff 
and 

administrators 
were 

traumatized.

The next day, one 

of the injured victims 
passed away. Once 
again, the headlines 
changed to reflect the 
new death toll. I could 
not fathom that this 
was real — every text 
from my loved ones, 
every story from that 
day, every headline in 
the news, served as a 
sobering reminder that 
this was all real. 

As soon as resourc-

es appeared to help aid the families of the victims and 
survivors, I knew I wanted to find a way to help from 
Ann Arbor. I made an online tool called a ‘linktree’ to 
consolidate ways to help. And yet, instead of jumping 
to contribute and spread information, people from 
outside of Oxford (or those who were not connected 
to the event) took to social media, flooding it with 
some of the most awful words I have ever read. 

Oxford was in mourning. But, rather than recog-

nizing the agonizing losses we had just experienced, 
strangers on social media were slandering the names 
of school officials or teachers they did not even know, 
claiming what they “should” have done or how they 
failed, as if everyone in that building are not also sur-
vivors of this traumatic event. And further, they were 
posting the face of the murderer on their timeline — 
an incredibly triggering act for survivors that has the 
potential to encourage copycat threats.

While of course, the internet isn’t real life and 

staying off social media is often one of the first rec-
ommendations after a school shooting occurs, I 
learned how quickly a town can be tainted by trag-
edies. 

My town held a vigil that week for those lost, 

and there was a panic caused by an attendee faint-
ing. Someone yelled for help, and out of fear, every-
one scrambled. My step-father scooped up my little 
brother and just started running. Survivors of the 
shooting reliving trauma, people in my town run-
ning for their lives, all due to the aftershocks of the 

shooting at Oxford. Media outlets present at the 
vigil were shoving cameras in the faces of mourn-
ing people, sobbing people — the vigil was only one 
of the many places that media outlets asserted their 
invasive presence. 

***

Once the initial shock wore off and I had taken 

the time to begin coping with the events of Novem-
ber 30, I realized that this tragedy took place after a 
devastating number of precedents.

In March 2018, a group of Oxford High School 

students held a walkout in solidarity with the Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School students. After 
we walked out, we held a vigil with 17 minutes of 
silence: one minute to acknowledge each victim of 
the Parkland school shooting. I remember helping 
to hold the pictures of some of the victims, looking 
at their innocent faces and then lifting them up for 
the crowd to acknowledge each life that was taken 
by the senseless act of violence on February 14, 2018. 
 

I silently reflected on this day this past Decem-

ber, as I drove home to Oxford from Ann Arbor to 
attend a memorial service for one of the Oxford 
victims. The silence was eerie as I drove past “Pray 
for Oxford” billboards and posters, the air growing 
denser as I reached closer to my home. I live on a

Content warning: Mentions of gun violence, school 

shooting.

I grew up in Oxford, Michigan. For better or worse, 

this town is my hometown. I used to complain about 
how boring it was, how nothing ever happened. We all 
did. God, how I wished that hadn’t changed. 

On Nov. 30, 2021, an Oxford High School student 

brought a gun to school and opened fire, injuring 11 
people and killing four students. The events of this 
tragedy took place in under 10 minutes. Within those 
minutes, my baby sister and the rest of her chemistry 
class were ushered out the window and down the 

street to safety. 
Luck feels like 
the wrong way to 

describe her relationship with these events; she was 
not lucky to be merely classrooms away from such 
violence. 

But I was able to go home and hug my sister that 

night, when an unforgivable number of families were 
not able to do the same. Their loss is one I cannot fath-
om, and one I will not try to claim or portray through 
my words. 

*** 

As an American public school student, school 

shootings, with such precedents as Sandy Hook and 

Parkland, are no longer 
surprises. But they all 
leave their impact on us. 
Each time, I mourned for 
the losses and felt close 
to the pain of the loss of 
those students. 

After the Parkland 

shooting, which took 
17 lives, many other 
students at OHS and I 
gathered before school 
to honor and grieve those 
lost. Splattered across the 
news and social media, 
it is easy to feel like you 
understand the impact, 

the reverberations of these sorts of events. 

I never quite expected a school shooting to happen 

in my community, and I naively thought I had an idea 
of what it would mean to experience it personally. I 
was wrong. 

Plenty has been said about those 10 minutes, and 

even more about the events leading up to them. Far 
less has been said about what happened to our com-
munity afterwards, but it is something that often 
comes up in conversation with my family. Through-
out the weeks and many conversations with my sister, 
we have come to see patterns in the often ignored feel-
ings and moments, and these are what I want to share 
with you. 

*** 

They don’t talk about what it means to experience a 

tragedy as a community. 

Minutes after it was announced in the press con-

ference that three people, students, children, had 
died, I began making calls. In the dim light of my 
apartment, the blinds drawn and my roommate held 
close, it still didn’t quite feel real. Scrolling through 
Instagram and my contacts list, I placed calls to any 
name I recognized from high school. To anyone and 
everyone that I could get ahold of who had family or 
friends in our high school. 

One of the first people I called was a girl I had 

known since kindergarten but hadn’t spoken to for 
over a year since leaving for college. We were friends in 
the way kids are in a small town; we grew up together 
yet were never that close.

“Hey.” Her voice wavered as she accepted the call. 
“Kyle?” Her brother. Tears falling down my face, I 

couldn’t bring myself to ask. 

“He’s fine, he’s OK,” she sobbed. “Abbey?” My little 

sister.

“She’s OK, she’s OK.” The sobs overwhelmed us 

both. 

What stands out most about this call — a moment I 

have often thought about since — is our parting words. 

“Paige?” she asked, still hoarse, voice quiet. I 

remember being huddled like a ball on the couch, 
hunched tight around my phone. 

“Yeah?” 
“I love you,” she said, much stronger now, adamant. 
“I love you too,” I said, pushing as much feeling as I 

could into the words. 

Driving home that night, I would call many more 

people who I hadn’t spoken to in years. College had 
caused us to drift apart, but one moment had yanked 
us back together, the shared trauma taut like a string 
between us. It was a pain that stretched between us, 
an unimaginable pain, but it was one we shared. 

These bonds stretched from the physical into the 

digital realm, too. For days, weeks, the tragedy over-
whelmed my social media feed. 

But, more than the activism or awareness I expect-

ed, there were posts meant to support the community.

shooting.

When I first met my dorm floormates my fresh-

man year, the interaction was a flurry of quick 
introductions on a few predictable topics. When the 
conversation inevitably arrived at “Where are you 
from?” I was shocked to find that almost all of the 
girls did not like their hometown. They shared a vari-
ety of negative sentiments about their high school, 
neighborhood or the people in their town — and col-
lectively agreed that they were happy to leave it all 
behind. They were relishing their mutual hatred for 
their former lives so much that I actually began to feel 
left out — because I loved my hometown. I love my 
hometown. 

Oxford, Michigan, was the best town to grow 

up in. Every place has its pitfalls and shortcomings, 
but I’ve always felt like Oxford consisted mainly of 
good people and a supportive community. Teachers 
remember your name years after you’ve been their 
student; they also recognize your siblings right when 
they walk into the classroom. Our coaching staff is full 
of Oxford alumni who came back after successful col-
lege and professional careers to give back to the pro-
grams that gave them their start. A large portion of my 
friends’ parents and my teachers were Oxford gradu-
ates, and now raise their families there. 

To me, Oxford has always been a safe place to return 

to, and I know that a lot of people would echo that sen-
timent. I have always been proud to call Oxford my 
home, the kind of place where you can go to the home-
coming game and see all of your teachers, coaches 
and extended family members coming out to reunite 
and sup-
port the 
school. 

The 

restau-
rants and 
stores 
down-
town 
would 
close for 
parades, 
cater 
events and host fundraisers for school programs. 
The administration and other staff members would 
subject themselves to falling in dunk tanks or getting 
smacked with pies in the face for our charity events, 
and were front and center playing games at our pep 
assemblies. The Ddean of Sstudents knew almost 
everyone by name, and there wasn’t one teacher who 
wouldn’t open up their classroom for a student at 
lunch if they needed extra help with work, or even just 
some quiet time alone. 

While I certainly do not claim that Oxford is a per-

fect school or community, I am proud to be from this 
place that fosters so many wonderful things; this feel-
ing has only grown stronger following recent events. 

Reflecting on that long-ago “hometown talk” I 

encountered innumerable times during move-in 
weekend, I remember that when I said I was from 

Oxford, 
Michigan, 
the 
only 

responses 
were 
a 

bunch 
of 

blank looks 
and “where’s 
that” com-
ments, even 
from 
the 

girls 
who 

were 
also 

from Michigan. For my first few years at U-M, that 
was how it went; unless they were from the immedi-
ate surrounding area, most people didn’t recognize 
the name. Of course, now it’s a different story. 

After the events of November 30, everyone has 

heard of Oxford — on every news channel, trend-
ing on Twitter and Instagram under the hashtag 
#OxfordStrong for weeks after the event. It’s such 
an odd feeling to go from having no one think twice 
when you say where you’re from to suddenly facing a 

variety of responses: pity, sadness, shock and even no 
acknowledgement at all. 

A few weeks ago, I was talking with my little sis-

ter, a sophomore at Oxford this year. She noted that, 
following the event, it was strange going to her travel 
volleyball practices with her teammates from other 
schools, sensing that they were all looking at her and 
thinking about it the whole time. She also told me that 
even now she feels hesitant to say where she is from 
because she doesn’t know how other people will react. 
Despite this, we both agree that, although sharing the 
name of our hometown carries a different weight now, 
it is still one packed with love, pride and resilience. 

In these past few months, the community of 

Oxford has done a lot of healing, aided by a surplus of 
support locally, statewide and nationally. Surrounding 
schools and organizations have hosted fundraisers, 
crafted apparel emblazoned with the “Oxford Strong” 
slogan, sent gift baskets to teachers and students 
(according to my sister) and made donations to many 
of the GoFundMe pages that were created. Troy High 
School even did a charity week to help Oxford fund its 
prom and other student activities. At the college and 
professional level, the Oxford block O with four hearts 
(in honor of the four students whose lives were lost) 
could be seen adorning jerseys and T
-shirts. During
