In response to opposition 

from 
Ann 
Arbor 
citizens 

regarding the formation of a 
police review board featuring 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
members, 
City 
Council 

passed an amended task force 
resolution Monday evening, 
allowing 
for 
increased 

autonomy for civilians in the 
formation of a task force to 
oversee the development of 
a police review board. The 
review board membership will 
be based on reccomendations 
by the City Administrator, 
as well as the Human Rights 
Commission. 

In 
a 
previous 
Human 

Rights Commission meeting 
in January, members moved 
to develop a task force to 
allow citizens to provide input 
in the formation of a police 
review board in response to 
demands from Transforming 
Justice Washtenaw initiative 
for transparency.

More than 80 residents 

came out Monday to oppose 
a 
police 
review 
board 

with 
positions 
for 
not 

only AAPD members and 
councilmembers, 
but 
also 

lacking in the ability to access 
investigation 
information 

outside 
of 
public 
data. 

Several council members also 
disputed the initial resolution.

Reform movements began 

gaining steam after the fatal 

shooting of Black resident 
Aura Rosser by James Ried, 
a white AAPD officer. After 
repeated calls from citizens 
and the HRC for council to 
improve oversight over local 
police, the council approved 
a $200,000 review of policing 
practices 
conducted 
by 

Chicago 
consulting 
firm 

Hillard 
Heintze, 
LLC. 

The firm released a report 

calling for a a “co-produced 
policing 
committee,” 
and 

many 
residents 
considered 

the unsatisfying, and even 
counteractive.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Jennifer Haines expressed 
frustration with the structure 
of the review board as well 
as the task force, and shared 
ideals of transparency and 
accountability.

“Right now we have a trust 

situation 
that 
is 
broken,” 

Haines said. “Hillard Heintze 
left many feeling without a 
voice. Nothing can be done if 
people don’t feel comfortable 
coming 
forward. 
People 

are more frightened of the 
AAPD than the issues they’re 
facing.”

University

students and representatives 
from 
Central 
Student 

Government gathered Monday 
night in the Michigan League 
for a town hall to discuss the 
suggestions 
and 
revisions 

for an updated version of the 
Campus Affordability guide.

The meeting was opened 

by CSG Vice President Nadine 
Jawad, a Public Policy senior, 
who 
reiterated 
the 
initial 

goal of the guide: to create 
a 
public 
document 
that 

included resources and tips 
to make living on campus 
more affordable for students. 
Jawad also stated the need to 
be intersectional with other 
issues like race and ethnicity. 

The group of about 20 

students 
first 
addressed 

the question of whether or 
not to tailor the guide to all 
students on campus or to have 
a specific section for lower-
income students. This question 
proved 
especially 
pertinent 

considering the creation of a 
response guide, titled “Being

Former Vice President Joe 

Biden spoke at the Michigan 
Theater Monday night as part of 
his American Promise Tour. The 
event consisted of a conversation 
between Biden and ESPN reporter 
Adam Schefter, a University of 
Michigan alum.

The tour is centered on his new 

book, “Promise Me, Dad: A Year 
of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose” 
released in November 2017. The 
book is a memoir that explores 
Biden’s experiences throughout 
2015, when he was serving as vice 
president and attempting to cope 
with the death of his son, Beau. 
Among other things, he reflects 
on his faith, his family and his 
career in public service. He did 
not, 
despite 
rumblings 
from 

political experts, comment on his 
candidacy in the 2020 presidential 
election. 

Biden spent most of his time at 

the event discussing those same 
topics. He spoke at length about his 
experiences following the death 
of his first wife and daughter in 
a car crash in 1972 (which Beau

After bringing Lil Yachty, 

Migos and Common to campus 
in 
recent 
years, 
MUSIC 

Matters’s 2018 SpringFest will 
be headlined by Louis the Child. 
The Chicago-based duo will 
play at Hill Auditorium on April 
4 as part of the organization’s 
annual social impact lifestyle 
festival.

The largest festival of its kind 

to be held on a college campus, 
SpringFest was created six 
years ago with the objective 
of uniting the University of 
Michigan and the Ann Arbor 
communities through art and 
culture. Billed as a “lifestyle 
festival,” SpringFest is a daylong 
festival boasting free musical 
performances on a day stage, 
art installations, food trucks, a 
fashion show and pop-up shops.

In a release, MUSIC Matters 

President Matt Ladis noted: 
“The goal of SpringFest is to 
provide a vehicle that unites all 
corners of Michigan’s campus 

and the broader community 
through lifestyle elements such 
as arts, music, social impact, 
technology and food.”

Louis the Child will cap off 

the day with their performance 
at Hill. Louis the Child rose to 
fame primarily through viral 
remixes and singles like “It’s 
Strange,” as well as opening 
spots for similar artists like the 
Chainsmokers 
and 
Madeon. 

Since then, they’ve performed 
at 
festivals 
like 
Coachella, 

Lollapalloza and Ultra. Last 
year, they released the EP 
Love is Alive. This is the duo’s 
first 
SpringFest 
appearance, 

and Louis the Child was last in 
Ann Arbor in 2016 when they 
headlined a show at the Blind 
Pig.

The group’s electronic sound 

is a departure from previous 
years, where the festival was 
headlined by one or multiple 
hip-hop 
artists. 
Last 
year, 

MUSIC 
Matters 
brought 
2 

Chainz, 
Desiigner 
and

Official action items sent Monday seeks acknowledgement of growing community 

The 
Latinx 
Alliance 
for 

Community Action, Support and 
Advocacy, an umbrella student 
group 
representing 
members 

of the Latino community at the 
University of Michigan, released a 
list of demands to administrators 
Monday morning outlining steps 
they feel the University needs to 
take in support of Latino students, 
faculty and staff members.

The demands revolve around 

Latino 
representation 
within 

offices, 
departments 
and 

administrative positions, as well 
as acknowledging the presence 
of the Latino community, the 
largest 
and 
fastest 
growing 

underrepresented 
minority, 

on campus. This school year’s 
enrollment 
report 
found 
the 

Hispanic and Latino community 
to comprise about 6 percent of the 
student body. 

In December, La Casa led a 

boycott of Multi-Ethnic Student 

Affairs after the office’s hiring 
search for a permanent assistant 
director 
returned 
no 
Latino 

candidates (Krishna Han was 
selected for the position earlier 
in January). The demands claim 
other departments that feature 
little or no Latino presence 
include the Center for Campus 
Involvement, 
University 

Housing, 
the 
Comprehensive 

Studies Program, the Office of 
Financial Aid and the Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions.

The 
demands 
originally 

began by citing anti-Latino bias 
incidents such as the defacing of 
the Rock at the beginning of the 
school year with slogans such 
as “F— Latinos” and President 
Trump’s slogan “MAGA,” short 
for “Make America Great Again.” 
Administrative 
responses 

included a condemnation from 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
in 
his 
convocation 

speech and an email from Chief 
Diversity Officer Rob Sellers. The 
list of demands critiques these

COLD NVR ENDS. puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Over 50 students gathered at 

the Ford School of Public Policy 
to discuss immigration policy 
and controversies surrounding 
the topic on Monday. The 
dialogue 
was 
hosted 
and 

facilitated 
by 
WeListen, 
an 

organization 
dedicated 
to 

encouraging open conversation 
between 
conservative 
and 

liberal students on campus.

WeListen 
was 
co-founded 

last September by Engineering 
senior Sonia Thosar and Public 

Policy senior Gabriel Lerner. 
Frustrated 
by 
the 
partisan 

divide and “echo chambers” they 
noticed on campus and across 
the nation, Thosar and Lerner 
launched the organization with 
the goal of giving students a 
chance 
to 
address 
political 

differences in a constructive 
way.

WeListen’s 
administrative 

board, which Thosar describes 
as a “50-50 split of liberals 
and 
conservatives,” 
has 

since facilitated a number of 
discussions on topics such as 
gun control, the refugee crisis, 

the death penalty and the right 
to protest.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Alli 

Berry, 
one 
of 
WeListen’s 

co-presidents, said the purpose 
of WeListen discussions is to 
expose participants to differing 
viewpoints and to establish 
commonalities.

“The ‘why’ behind someone’s 

disagreement is often more 
important than what they’re 
disagreeing 
with 
you 
on 

because a lot of the time our 
disagreements actually come 
from shared values,” Berry said. 

According 
to 
Thosar, 

WeListen 
makes 
a 

particular effort to reach out 
to conservative students.

“It is a really liberal 

campus, so what we’ve been 
really trying to do is market 
to conservatives and make 
sure they know about us, 
and they know that it’s not 
a place that they’re going 
to get attacked for their 
viewpoints,” Thosar said. 
“We’ve actually had about 
30 
percent 
conservative 

attendance, which is pretty 
good 
considering 
this 

school.”

WeListen 
gauges 
the 

political 
leanings 
of 

participants 
by 
asking 

them to sign in and fill out 
a survey at the beginning 
of each event. Attendees 
rank themselves on a scale 
of one for most liberal to 
seven for most conservative. 
Participants also answered 
a question about the subject 
being discussed.

To kick off Monday’s 

session 
on 
immigration, 

WeListen’s 
leadership 

team 
presented 
a 
few 

introductory 
slides. 
Berry 

and 
her 
co-president, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Nick 
Tomaino, 

outlined 
WeListen’s 
mission 

and 
offered 
suggestions 
on 

how to engage in considerate, 
productive conversation.

Other board members gave an 

overview of the discussion topic, 
reviewing immigration policy 
under the past four presidents, 
presenting common liberal and 
conservative viewpoints on the 
issue and highlighting recent 
news pertaining to immigration.

The 
students 
were 
then 

broken 
up 
into 
politically 

diverse groups of six or seven. 
The 
groupings, 
based 
on 

responses 
to 
the 
entrance 

survey, were determined using 
a sorting algorithm developed 
by WeListen’s vice president of 
technology.

Handouts with immigration 

facts and statistics, as well as 
guiding discussion questions, 
were distributed throughout the 
room.

The groups spent about 10 

minutes 
chatting 
casually, 

then the co-presidents asked 
them 
to 
start 
discussing 

immigration. 
The 
groups 

delved into topics such as 
merit-based 
immigration, 

assimilation, Trump’s border 
wall, 
humanitarianism, 
visa 

expiration and the role of the 
United States government in 
protecting its citizens. Another 
common 
theme 
was 
“brain 

drain,” 
the 
phenomenon 
of 

highly-trained 
professionals 

leaving developing nations for 
countries like the U.S.

and Hunter, Biden’s second son, 
survived). He and his young sons 
grew closer as they coped with the 
loss.

“As much as I raised them, they 

raised me,” Biden said

As they grew older, Biden’s sons 

became interested in public service, 
and Beau was poised to become 
governor of Delaware when he was 
diagnosed with brain cancer. At 
the event, Biden talked about how 
much he looks up to Beau and his 
other children for their courage and 
their commitment to public service.

He also focused on his work with 

the Biden Cancer Initiative, which 
seeks to raise funds for research 
and facilitate progress in the fight 
against cancer. Biden and his wife, 
Dr. Jill Biden, have spent a large 
portion of their time over the last 
year working on this project.

Biden brushed aside questions of 

whether he will seek the Democratic 
presidential nomination in 2020, 
just as he has at a number of public 
appearances in the last year. 
Though Schefter attempted to work 
the election into the conversation, 
Biden chose to focus on his family 
and personal experiences and gave 
no commentary or thoughts on the 
current American political world 
for the duration of the conversation.

LSA freshman Maeve Skelly 

has long been inspired by Biden. 
She attended the event and spoke 
positively 
about 
his 
personal 

qualities.

“I’ve always looked up to 

Joe Biden as not only a political 
figure, but as someone I admire 
personally,” Skelly said. “I admire 
his resilience and his courage 
because it takes a lot to come and 
talk about the stuff that he did — 
especially writing about it in his 
book and all the hardships he’s been 
through — and using that as hope.

Hope was a key theme of Biden’s 

book and the event. Before Beau 
died, he urged his father and 
the rest of his family to continue 
working for the things they cared 
about; he hoped that they wouldn’t 
“turn inward” after his death. 
Biden said he was motivated in his 
work by Beau’s passionate public 
service, and that he kept working 
after Beau’s death because he knew 
Beau would have wanted him to.

Biden ended the event on a 

positive note, speaking about the 
accomplishments of the Biden 
Cancer Initiative. He offered some 
hopeful parting words.

“Folks, in the next five to 10 years 

you’re going see a radical change in 
life expectancy with cancer. You’re 
going to see some genuine cures,” 
Biden said. “That’s the kind of stuff 
that’s happening. That’s why I’m so 
optimistic not just about cancer, but 
quite frankly the country.”

actions as insufficient and lacking 
in consistent follow-ups after the 
initial impact at the beginning of 
the semester.

La 
Casa 
external 
director 

Yezenia Sandoval, an LSA junior, 
said University officials have not 
exhibited urgency in responding 
to the needs of the Latino 
community.

“We’ve had meetings with 

Schlissel, (E. Royster Harper), 
and Sellers and we saw that the 
responses were like, ‘Yeah we 
understand,’ but there was no 
urgency attached to it,” Sandoval 
said. “They said, ‘We don’t know 
how we can help.’ Now, they’ve 
had time to understand what we’re 
going through. Now, it’s time to 
act, to back up their work. This is 
an accountability mechanism.”

At the time of publication, 

University spokespersons did not 
respond to requests for comment.

The 
first 
three 
demands 

concern hiring more Latino staff, 
senior administrators and faculty 
members. One point calls for a 
strategic hiring plan endorsed 
by Schlissel “to increase the 
number of faculty with research 
and teaching expertise in LatinX 
communities and cultures.” The 
demands claim no deans, executive 
officers 
or 
senior 
academic 

officials at the University identify 
as Latino. 

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for Student Life, wrote 
in a December email she aims 
to make hiring processes as 
inclusive as possible, with a focus 
on selecting the most qualified 
candidates. 

“When we are at our best, 

we create a diverse candidate 
pool and work in partnership to 
identify strong candidates for any 
position,” she wrote.

Sandoval said a lack of Latino 

professors 
across 
programs 

negatively affects Latino students 
and their studies when they don’t 

see more representation leading 
the classroom.

“I’m a Political Science major 

and I take a class with (Vanessa 
Cruz) Nichols, the one junior 
faculty member who is Latina in 
the entire department,” she said. 
“In a department dominated by 
white men, just seeing someone 
reflect my background and share 
commonalities makes me feel 
more comfortable. But that doesn’t 
just have to be Latinx individuals, 
but those who have experience 
working 
alongside 
Latinx 

community. It brings a sense of 
belonging.”

The Latina/o Studies Program, 

the fourth demand, called for 
support for Latino faculty who 
are doing the vast majority of 
mentoring of Latino students. 
The group requested resources 
to nurture and establish research 
relationships 
between 
Latino 

undergraduate students, graduate 
students and faculty members. 
La Casa also requested a “LatinX 
Campus Climate Study” to assess 

the opinions of Latino students, 
faculty and staff on campus and 
to further support additional 
programs.

Results from the Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion Campus 
Climate survey released last fall 
found Hispanic students are 132 
percent more likely to experience 
discrimination on campus

The next two demands — the 

creation of an “Institute for Latinx 
Research” 
and 
more 
Latino-

inspired spaces on campus — 
outlined the need for spaces in the 
community that commemorated 
Latino 
people. 
The 
institute 

would focus on the study of Latino 
communities in the 21st century.

“We want a university in which 

we can all learn and thrive,” 
the report reads. “We want a 
climate free from hostility. We 
want to see ourselves reflected 
in the University’s leadership, in 
its student services staff, in its 
faculty and in its classrooms. We 
want classes and curricula where 
Latinx contributions to literature, 

arts, culture and society are not 
ignored. We want support for 
our research at all levels. We 
want a space where our culture 
is centered and we do not have 
to feel like outsiders. We want a 
university that reflects the reality 
of a country that is now, and always 
has been, shaped by our presence.”

Sandoval said the demands are 

a product of several generations 
of Latino activism on campus and 
brought together students with 
older faculty and staff.

“There’s history here,” she 

said. We’ve never seen organizing 
to this extent we’ve never seen 
anything like this. It’s been really 
cool for staff, faculty, and our 
members to see that. Everyone’s 
been very excited and hopeful, to 
see our community come together 
to advocate for ourselves.”

In order to remain sustainable, 

the 
demands 
request 
the 

University recognize La Casa as a 
central voice in the representation 
of the Latino community, and 
guarantee $65,000 in funding 

for program support. La Casa 
specifically requested financial 
support of the Assisting Latinas to 
Maximize Achievement program, 
as well as allowing the program to 
start before the University’s move-
in date.

Other 
demands 
include 

“the creation of a University of 
Michigan outreach initiative that 
specifically targets underserved 
communities with a significant 
presence 
of 
Latino 
students, 

modifications to the Wolverine 
Pathways 
program, 
sufficient 

staffing to promote Latino student 
outreach efforts, and a new 
presidential advisory board on 
Latino affairs.

Sandoval said the demands 

are 
meant 
to 
go 
beyond 

administrators, “all the way to the 
Regents.”

“We just want recognition 

that the Latinx community is 
present,” Sandoval said. “And 
then representation. It’s so cool 
to usher this moment—hopefully, 
one day we end up in the archives.” 

Atlanta trio Migos to Hill. Louis 
the Child will mark the first time 
a group of this nature headlines 
the festival.

“Electronic music has never 

touched 
the 
stage 
in 
Hill 

Auditorium at such a large scale,” 
MUSIC 
Matters 
Talent 
and 

Concert Chair Sam Reisman said 
in the release.

A portion of ticket sales for the 

show will go towards funding 
MUSIC Matters’s new initiative, 
“CoMMunity 
Partnership,” 

a grant the organization will 
provide to a philanthropic student 
organization at the University. 

This year, for its first partnership, 
MUSIC Matters will be giving its 
grant to Books for a Benefit.

Books for a Benefit seeks 

to 
promote 
literacy 
by 

providing access to books and 
other 
academic 
resources 
to 

underserved youth in Michigan 
schools. Co-founded by CSG 
Vice President Nadine Jawad, 
the Books for Benefit Chapter 
at the University has a network 
of 200 volunteers. The festival 
will feature a showcase of the 
organization.

The 
festival’s 
social 
focus 

extends to all aspects of the 
day, and 2018’s iteration will 
be a zero-waste event with 
environmentally-friendly 
food 

trucks 
and 
social 
activism 

showcases among the arts and 
culture events.

A full line-up for the daytime 

component of the festival is still 
to come.

“We are thrilled with our artist 

selection for the night portion 
as well as the programming we 
have in store for the day, all of 
which should make for the most 
dynamic SpringFest yet,” Ladis 
said in the release.

Tickets to the show at Hill 

will start at $9.99 for students 
and $14.99 for the general public. 
They will go on sale Thursday, 
Feb. 8 at noon for in-person sales 
through the Michigan Union 
Ticket Office, by phone and 
through MUSIC Matters’s official 
site. 

Not-Rich at UM.” 

LSA 
sophomore 
Sydney 

McKinstry 
argued 
there 

needs to be more accessibility 
in order to find important 
information quickly in the 
guide.

“I 
definitely 
think 
that 

there’s 
value 
in 
having 

sections and including the 
all-in-one 
document 
that’s 

accessible to everyone, but if 
there are not sections that are 
labeled or targeted for certain 
groups I think that it can be 
difficult to cipher through all 
the information,” McKinstry 
said. 
“Somebody 
who’s 

looking for resources to find 
an affordable place to live, 
who are already struggling 
with funds, aren’t going to 
need to read an entire section 
on obtaining money through 
canceling services and other 
budgeting-type stuff.”

The group generally agreed 

the guide would need to go 
through 
reorganization 
to 

address this problem while 
taking care not to single out 
specific groups.

“I think we can think about 

a way to format it where it 
does dissect that information 
because 
homogenizing 

all 
budgeting 
into 
all 

socioeconomic status was not 
a good move, and I think that 
there is a way to disseminate 
that information in a better, 
more organized way,” Jawad 
said.

Later, 
Engineering 

sophomore Brendan Jackson 
voiced 
concern 
over 
the 

section 
regarding 
debt 

transfers, explaining it didn’t 
include enough information 
explaining how to do it safely. 
The 
discussion 
continued 

with a focus on how CSG can 
implement subsequent events 
focusing on financial literacy 
at the University, especially 
for first-year and second-year 
students.

“That 
section 
can 
be 

extremely 
dangerous 
for 

people who don’t know what 
debt transfers are and don’t 
know how to do them safely, 
and it can actually lead to 
a lot more financial trouble 
than you started in. I think 
definitely if it’s going to be 
included in future versions, 
it needs to be included with 
resources with how to do it 
safely,” Jackson said.

The 
group 
discussed 

strategies 
for 
increasing 

student 
turnout 
at 
CSG-

facilitated student workshops 

and 
other 
possible 
means 

of making this information 
available for students. LSA 
senior 
Zoe 
Proegler, 
who 

criticized the guide through 
a Facebook post after its 
initial publication, voiced her 
opinion 
regarding 
student 

participation in informational 
programs.

“I think having some sort 

of financial literacy training 
could be helpful,” Proegler 
said. “That is a huge thing that 
most people on this campus 
have to deal with, and not just 
student loan debt. Talking in 
a more responsible way about 
safe ways to manage credit 
card debt and planning around 
that could be really helpful.”

Later, the group discussed 

the history of tenant unions 
at the University and the 
possibility of re-instituting 
them. In the past, tenant 
unions have advocated for 
fair housing costs and fair 
treatment 
by 
landlords. 

The group examined how a 
possible tenant union could 
benefit current housing costs 
by advocating for reasonable 
prices and helping students 
with budgeting. This topic was 
tabled for further discussion 
in the future.

In the conclusion of the 

meeting, 
Jawad 
expressed 

CSG’s intention to conduct 
a survey as a method to 
more 
effectively 
gather 

student opinion on specific 
sections 
of 
the 
original 

guide. 
Additionally, 
she 

included plans to have student 
representatives from various 
student 
organizations 
and 

groups to vet drafts of the new 
CSG affordability guide before 
its re-publication.

Not 
only 
did 
residents 

express discomfort with the 
proposed task force resolution, 
but many council members 
added 
in 
criticism 
of 
the 

seeming lack of trust between 
civilians and elected officials, 
perpetuated by provisions for 
elected officials to sit on the 
review board.

Before the amendments were 

implemented, Councilmember 
Sumi 
Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 

1, 
said 
she 
believed 
the 

resolution fails to express basic 
democratic principles.

“We 
cannot 
believe 
in 

democratic 
principles 
and 

have an institution that is not 
bound by checks and balances,” 
Kailasapathy said. “Who would 
want to do this? Do you want 
to be just a PR person for the 
police 
department? 
There 

are lots of good parts to this 
resolution but there are four 
or five holes in it that need to 
be changed otherwise it is just 
going to be a feel-good party 
that won’t really do anything.”

Councilmember Jack Eaton, 

D-Ward 4, shared Kailasapthy’s 
view. He said he believed the 
task force and the review board 
itself could be better and should 
not limit civilian participation.

“If we are going to have a 

citizen committee, it has to 
be led by citizens, not staff,” 
Eaton said. “I believe that 
we must form a task force. It 
should not include any city 
member as a part of the voting 

process. Nothing prohibits us 
from giving (the review board) 
more power than advised in the 
charter. We should give it the 
ability to act independently of 
the police.”

In 
the 
review 
of 
the 

resolution, 
Eaton 
initiated 

many changes, touching on 
every 
bullet 
point 
within 

the resolution. He called for 
independence for the task force 
and the board, investigative 
privileges and the exclusion of 
city employees.

With Eaton’s encouragement, 

the 
council 
amended 
the 

resolution to allow grounds for 
establishing a task force where 
council members and AAPD 
members are not allowed to 
vote, and a police review board 
to be staffed by individuals 
recommended 
by 
the 
City 

Administrator, as well as the 
Human Rights Commission.

Amid 
these 

recommendations, the council 
will also look to fill the board 
with a large representation 
of individuals from heavily 
policed areas, mental health 
workers, 
restorative 
justice 

workers and social workers. 
Finally, the council also passed 
an 
amendment 
to 
create 

procedures within the police 
review board to receive civilian 
complaints.

Many residents, including 

members 
of 
Transforming 

Justice Washtenaw, discussed 
their frustration with lack of 
transparency in the AAPD. 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Dan 

Michniewicz 
said 
he 
has 

attended four council meetings 

and repeatedly asked for AAPD 
transparency and reiterated his 
frustration once more.

“I ask you again to listen 

to 
the 
residents 
and 
stop 

the 
bureaucratic 
nonsense,” 

Michniewicz said.

While the council agreed 

to pass the amendments and 
the resolution itself, there was 
discussion of allowing the task 
force, as well as the board, 
access to confidential data. 
Originally, only the public data 
regarding 
policing 
practices 

was to be made available for 
investigative purposes.

Despite 
the 
call 
for 

transparency, Councilmember 
Chuck Warpehoski, D-Ward 5, 
expressed concern regarding 
confidentiality.

“Moving towards a general 

level 
of 
transparency 
is 

important, but confidentiality 
is also important,” Warpehoski 
said. 
“We 
need 
to 
make 

sure we are honoring the 
confidentiality of people not 
convicted of crimes, that we are 
not endangering minors. If this 
moves forward it brings us back 
to the issue of confidentiality.”

Before the over two-hour 

long discussion on the task force 
resolution, City Council, as well 
as several members of the local 
school board, discussed school 
transportation difficulties. The 
council also passed a resolution 
authorizing the city to seek 
permission from the Michigan 
Supreme 
Court 
to 
file 
an 

amicus curiae brief in Michigan 
Gun Owners, Inc. v. Ann Arbor 
Public Schools.

I think it can 
be difficult 

to cipher 

through all the 

information. 

Provost 
Martin 
Philbert 

launched a new task force 
this semester to investigate 
the undergraduate education 
experience at the University 
of Michigan. The “Task Force 
on a Michigan Undergraduate 
Education 
in 
the 
Third 

Century,” 
composed 
of 
11 

professors, one lecturer and 
two student representatives, 
all from a wide variety of 
departments 
and 
schools, 

will meet until June. In their 
meetings, held every other 
week, the group will look into 
what a University education 
looks like now and what it 
might look like in the future.

Philbert started the task 

force to examine the ways 
the University can alter its 
approach to the undergraduate 
education as it moves into its 
third century.

“For the last 200 years, the 

University of Michigan has 
prepared undergraduates to 
be leaders and public servants 
in society,” Philbert said. “As 
the University embarks on its 
third century amid a rapidly 
changing landscape in higher 
education, we must seek to 

understand how we deliver 
this vital service and how we 
might shape instruction and 
the undergraduate experience 
for the future.”

Some of the topics the group 

will focus on include figuring 
out what makes a University 
of 
Michigan 
education 

distinctive, 
examining 
how 

shared goals impact teaching 
and considering the role of 
the University in preparing 
the next generation of citizens 
and professionals. They will 
eventually create a preliminary 
report with next steps for the 
Provost. 

Anne 
Curzan, 
associate 

dean for the humanities and 
co-chair of the task force, said 
in a University press release 
the group will also grapple 
with the role the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan 
plays in an undergraduate 
education.

“I think as part of that 

mission we’re really interested 
in thinking about what we 
know about how people learn 
and the extent to which we 
want students to be thinking 
about how they learn,” Curzan 
said. “We also would like to 
think hard about what it means 
when you take the principles of 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
and put them at the center of 
undergraduate education at 
the University of Michigan.”

Engineering senior Kevin 

Jiang, one of the two students 
on the task force, thinks 
creating a vision for the future 
of education at the University 

will 
be 
the 
group’s 
most 

important job. While working 
with such an accomplished 
group of professors is a little 
intimidating to Jiang, he’s 
excited to get to work.

“I’m a really big visioning 

person,” Jiang said. “I think 
visioning is super important 
to 
guide 
any 
organization 

forward. So I think this task 
force is really setting the 
vision for how education is 
going to look at the University 
of Michigan.”

T

he other day, I logged into 
my 
Facebook 
account 

and noticed a notification 

on my timeline. It was a message 
from Facebook itself, urging me to 
update my profile picture. The exact 
message — or rather, command 
— was written in bold font across 
my screen: “It’s been a while since 
you updated your profile picture. 
Choose a recent photo of yourself 
so people can find you easily.” I was 
taken aback. What was wrong with 
my current profile picture? And 
furthermore, I had last updated it 
in March. That’s only about eight 
months; I really don’t look any 
different now.

Despite Facebook’s ever-enticing 

recommendation, I did not change 
my profile picture. I am perfectly 
content with my profile picture 
the way it is. However, I am still 
troubled by the entire situation. The 
fact that Facebook can now directly 
encourage users to make changes to 
their appearance and claim that it 
is for the satisfaction of other users 
is deeply alarming. It reflects the 
dangerous vanity that has become 
a core value in not only the social 
media sphere, but in our society in 
general. It encourages the validation 
of oneself through the approval of 
others in the form of receiving virtual 
“likes.” Moreover, because we are 
able to edit the photos that we share, 
we are able to get rid of whatever we 
don’t want our audiences to see. In 
this way, we are creating a culture 
of deception of others and ourselves.

Every day, over 350 million 

Facebook 
photos 
are 
shared. 

That’s a lot of posting, and a lot of 
opportunities for users to get a 
peek into the lives of others. This 
is where the damage can occur. 
Research suggests that appearance 
comparisons — common in social 
media — is doing an exceptional 
job of making us feel bad about 
ourselves. This makes perfect sense. 
It’s because social media presents 
the perfect paradox: It allows you 
to display to others how great and 
exciting your life is. However, it 
allows for you to see how great and 
exciting everyone else’s life is, so 
you can’t help but compare yourself 
to them.

This leads to the internalization 

of cultural ideals about beauty, body 
image and lifestyle, which can make 
us feel eternally dissatisfied. For 
example, approximately 68 percent 
of women report being dissatisfied 
with their bodies. In my case, after I 
received orders to change my profile 
picture, I wondered: If Facebook 
isn’t even satisfied with my profile 

picture, then should I be? At that 
moment, even my own satisfaction 
was subject to the judgment of 
social media.

This leads us to the issue of self-

validation through the approval of 
others, which is a field that I believe 
Facebook particularly excels in. 
Let’s re-examine the line: “Choose 
a recent photo of yourself so people 
can find you more easily.” To me, this 
is pretty remarkable. If a person does 
not know what I look like enough to 
find me based on my current profile 
picture, then we probably aren’t close 
friends in real life. Furthermore, it 
reinforces a constant pressure to 
maintain an image, whatever it may 
be. Frequently, how we construct 
this image is based on validation that 
we get from our followers in the form 
of “likes” and comments. In fact, 
researchers say that millennials, who 
comprise the largest age group on 
Facebook, are now more than ever 
craving external validation because 
they have become so accustomed 
to receiving praise online. This is 
a phenomenon referred to as the 
“generation validation” effect, which 
is rooted in social media.

As social media has evolved, so 

has a key component in receiving 
validation: 
editing. 
Through 

editing applications such as VSCO 
or FaceTune, users can retouch 
essentially any component of a 
photo. Whether you want to edit out 
a photobomb or whiten your teeth, 
you have the ability to alter reality. 
Editing has become a big part of 
social media; for example, the photo 
editing app Camera 360 has over 800 
million users around the world.

FaceTune allows you to make 

drastic changes to yourself, such 
as widening smiles, concealing 
wrinkles and even changing eye 
color. This is a perfect example of 
the danger of photo editing: It allows 
users to choose which aspects of 
themselves they want to enhance, 
reduce or alter. We no longer accept 
ourselves, but instead put out an 
enhanced image of what we think 
we should look like. And apparently, 
the secret lies in the face: Research 
shows that Instagram photos that 
feature faces get 38 percent more 
likes than those without. Suddenly, 
FaceTune’s teeth-whitening feature 
sounds appealing, doesn’t it?

If we follow Facebook’s advice 

and post to attract attention from 
followers, then, of course, we are 
going to be encouraged to use 
photo-editing apps to ensure that we 
look the very best. However, what 
happens when our virtual selves 
don’t match reality?

In 2014, the term “catfish” 

officially made it into the Merriam-
Webster online dictionary. It is 
defined as “A person who sets up 
a false personal profile on a social 
networking site for fraudulent or 
deceptive purposes.” The catfishing 
phenomenon 
started 
with 
the 

documentary Catfish, which then 
inspired MTV’s Nev Schulman 
and Max Joseph, whose TV series 
documents actual cases of fraudulent 
online relationships. In almost 
every episode, the relationship 
starts on Facebook, and almost 
always the perpetrator uses a fake 
profile picture to deceive the other 
person. While photo editing isn’t as 
extreme as “catfishing,” one thing 
is clear: It is very easy to deceive 
people online. Facebook can’t check 
the authenticity of a profile, and 
sometimes the only proof we have is 
in the pictures. With the accessibility 
of 
photo-editing 
applications, 

we have the ability to seem like a 
completely different person online, 
which can present a problem when 
things don’t quite match up in reality.

Furthermore, 
there 
are 
the 

consequences that photo editing has 
on the perpetuation of unrealistic 
beauty and body image expectations 
placed particularly on women in 
our society. Now we really have no 
excuse to not look perfect in every 
picture. By using editing software 
to change the way we naturally 
look, aren’t we just giving into the 
unrealistic expectations placed upon 
us by society that we constantly fight 
against? We must be wary of how 
much of ourselves we seek to change.

To me, self-satisfaction comes 

from internal self-acceptance, not 
from the critical reception of my 
profile picture. After all, the instant 
gratification 
that 
social 
media 

rewards us with is not tangible or 
enduring; instead, it is short-lived 
and superficial. It is dangerous 
when social networking sites such 
as Facebook attempt to interfere 
with how we view ourselves. I like 
my profile picture, and I will change 
it when I am ready to, not when 
Facebook tells me to. We should 
strive to be content with who we are 
as individuals, rather than worry 
about the pressures of our virtual 
image. At the end of the day, I think 
that face-to-face interactions are 
more valuable and I believe there are 
too many other things in the world 
to worry about than my “outdated” 
Facebook profile picture.

A

new 
kind 
of 
grading 

system is gaining traction 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan. About 8,000 students 
at the University’s Ann Arbor 
campus 
have 
earned 
grades 

through GradeCraft, in which 
they progressively gain points 
throughout 
the 
semester 
by 

choosing 
between 
a 
variety 

of 
assignments 
to 
complete. 

GradeCraft aims to give students 
greater 
academic 
autonomy, 

encourages them to take risks 
and works to boost their self-
confidence. Results have been 
promising — the January 2018 
issue of the journal Games and 
Culture reported that gameful 
course 
design 
is 
positively 

correlated with students “working 
harder and feeling more in control 
of their class performance.”

Though almost 100 professors 

from 28 departments across the 
University have tried GradeCraft 
so far, in my experience most 
courses here don’t take such a self-
designed approach to learning. 
Grading systems continue to vary 
widely and, for courses in LSA, 
they’re often up to the complete 
discretion of individual professors. 
And while LSA classes differ in 
their grading structures, The 
Ross School of Business takes a 
completely 
non-self-determined 

approach to students’ grades: It 
assesses each and every class on a 
bell curve, irrespective of learning 
material, types of assignments or 
student performance. 

A look into The Michigan 

Daily’s guide of grade distributions 
in LSA reveals bell curves in some 
large introductory courses like 
Mathematics 115 and Economics 
101. These kinds of classes tend to 
serve as a prerequisite for majors, 
“weed out” many freshmen from 
pursuing those majors and set 
intentionally 
difficult 
exams 

to create a wide distribution of 
grades. Advanced courses in LSA 
typically use an absolute grading 
system to assess students — in my 
own experience taking a number of 
upper-level courses in 12 different 
departments, I have only been 

graded on a curve in the Economics 
Department.

Students in business courses, 

however, are perpetually sorted on 
a bell curve that doesn’t necessarily 
raise their raw scores. This places 
them in a state similar to students 
in “weeder” LSA classes in the 
sense that one student’s gain is 
inherently another’s loss. The 
curve is as follows: Grades for all 
core classes in the Business School 
are distributed with less than 40 
percent of students receiving an 
A- or above, less than 90 percent 
receive a B or above, and over 10 
percent receiving a B- or below.

The problem with this grading 

system isn’t in numerical outcomes 
— the Business School’s curve 
doesn’t impact students’ overall 
GPAs significantly. The average 
sophomore transfer to the program 
comes in with a 3.7 GPA and the 
Business School’s classes roughly 
generate a B+ average. Grade 
inflation is mixed; in quantitative 
core classes with low average 
test scores, grades inflate, while 
in other classes with generally 
high raw scores, they deflate. Few 
students struggle to pass classes 
since many professors avoid giving 
grades less than a B-.

The 
real 
problem 
lies 
in 

the implications of the curve 
on 
students’ 
learning 
styles, 

relationships with classmates and 
self-perceptions. 
Consistently 

grading on a bell curve creates a 
toxic environment where students 
are judged only relative to each 
other. They come to view their 
grades — and consequent success 
at the University — as a zero-sum 
game between themselves and 
their peers. If they’re consistently 
graded lower than classmates, 
they may make negative social 
comparisons and lose general 
motivation to do well.

Bell curves foster a competitive, 

rather 
than 
collaborative 

atmosphere, and disincentivize 
students from helping and learning 
from their peers. Especially in 
qualitative classes where students’ 
collectively high raw scores are 
curved down, and they’re assessed 

more heavily on performance 
in 
class 
participation, 
group 

presentations and essays than 
exams, the curve truly doesn’t 
match the material and desired 
classroom environment.

Emily Yerington, a University 

alum who transferred out of 
the Business School, said in an 
interview with The Daily while 
critiquing the Business school’s 
pedagogy: “Even though they 
curve it high, it’s just a bad 
mentality when you’re not worried 
about how much you’re learning, 
you’re worried about how you’re 
doing compared to everyone else.”

The Business School’s one-size-

fits-all approach also ultimately 
runs counter to its purported 
values. The school frequently 
references collaboration, inclusion, 
community and positive business 
as integral facets of the Ross 
experience. For example, its Center 
for Positive Organizations has led 
extensive research on positive 
leadership 
and 
advocates 
for 

organizations and companies to 
develop cultures of collaboration 
and empowerment.

A New York Times piece 

further 
argues 
against 
the 

mentality ingrained in bell curves 
because it doesn’t reflect the real 
advantages of students taking on 
a collaborative approach in their 
later careers. A meta-analysis 
of studies of employees across 
industries finds that in the long run, 
“leaders reward people who make 
the team and the organization 
more successful.”

I encourage the school to look 

inward, implement the findings of 
its research in its own curriculum 
and experiment with a grading 
system 
like 
GradeCraft. 
This 

would not only fall in line with its 
research on positive organizations, 
but also generally foster a desire 
among its students to learn the 
material and achieve — rather than 
simply come out above their peers.

Bell curves breed competition

R

ichard 
Spencer 
is 
the 

country’s leading white 
supremacist. 
Students 

Allied for Freedom and Equality is a 
Michigan student group that “seeks 
to advance the causes of freedom, 
justice, human rights and equality 
for all peoples.” The group has 
made the prevention of Spencer 
from ever setting foot on campus 
a high priority; its Facebook 
profile picture proudly declares 
#StopSpencer “Because you don’t 
negotiate with Nazis.” 

So you can understand our shock 

when we discovered that SAFE 
was hosting a teach-in touting the 
views of … Richard Spencer. That’s 
right. The very organization that has 
vociferously opposed Spencer and 
his odious views believes he is worth 
listening to on a single subject: Israel

The teach-in, titled “Richard 

Spencer, Anti-Semite and Zionist: 
Israel & The Far Right,” promises to 
“explore the Far Right’s affinity for 
the State of Israel, investigating how 
Israel has become a paradigmatic 
ethnostate for white supremacists 
like Richard Spencer.” Is there 
anything to this claim? Do alt-right 
racists like Spencer indeed have a 
special affinity for the Jewish state?

To hear Spencer tell it, yes.
“You could say that I am a 

white Zionist,” he said to an Israeli 
interviewer 
this 
past 
August, 

“in the sense that I care about 
my people. I want us to have a 
secure homeland that’s for us 
and ourselves just like you want a 
secure homeland in Israel.”

In other words: Just as the 

Jewish people care about protecting 
themselves in Israel, so too does 
Spencer and his band of white 
nationalists care about protecting 
the interests of his “people.” 
White people.

Do you get what he’s doing 

here? He is twisting the meaning 
and history of the Zionist idea — a 
homeland for a people oppressed, 

dispossessed and decimated — in 
order to further his own vision for a 
white ethnostate. Not a people with 
a shared religion and culture, but 
humans who happen to have the 
same skin color. And who certainly 
haven’t been oppressed or murdered 
for their religion.

Don’t listen to us, listen to the 

Southern Poverty Law Center: “Such 
historical comparisons show how 
desperate Spencer is to legitimize 
his agenda. After all, if white people 
are dispossessed, why shouldn’t they 
get a homeland, too? The problem, 
of course, is that white Americans 
have not been dispossessed, no 
matter how often that claim is made 
by ideologues of the racist right.” 
In the same interview with Israel’s 
Channel 2 in which he calls himself 
a white Zionist, Spencer said: “Jews 
have been vastly overrepresented 
in the left right now, vastly 
overrepresented in what you 
could call the establishment that 
is Ivy League-educated people 
who determine policy. White 
people are being dispossessed 
from this country.” 

Spencer’s words drip with the 

venom familiar in classic anti-
Semitic works like the “Protocols of 
The Elders of Zion.” His ideas should 
be condemned for the prejudiced 
nonsense that they are, not more 
closely examined for nuggets that 
happen to lend themselves to an anti-
Zionist narrative.

And that narrative is built on 

lies that ignore fundamental truths 
about Israel and the people who call it 
home. Some facts SAFE might want 
to consider: Israel is home to Black 
and brown Jews from countries 
including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya, 
Yemen and Syria. About 20 percent 
of the Israeli population is Arab. 
Judaism has never had a race 
requirement: Moses, our religion’s 
most important prophet, married a 
Black woman. The idea that we even 
have to point out such obvious truths 

is painful.

It is especially so during a 

moment in which Jews in this 
country are being attacked by 
the likes of Spencer.

Our 
American 
Jewish 

community has been under attack 
by the alt-right movement. At the 
deadly 
rally 
in 
Charlottesville, 

Spencer and his fellow marchers 
chanted “Jews will not replace us” 
and “Blood and soil,” a traditional 
Nazi cry. So when we heard that 
Spencer would not be speaking 
on campus this semester, we were 
relieved. Now, this event brings 
Spencer’s vile rhetoric and ideas to 
the forefront of the conversation.

By clothing anti-Semitism in 

the trendy garb of open dialogue, 
discussion or a teach-in, SAFE is 
falling for Spencer’s scheme and 
elevating an unapologetic anti-
Semite. His prerogative is to infect 
as many people as possible with 
his racist conception of the world. 
By giving his words weight, SAFE 
is accomplishing just that. When 
you are resorting to parroting the 
words of a neo-Nazi to promote your 
political agenda, you’ve lost.

SAFE’s upcoming event serves as 

an example of how anti-Semitism 
has seeped into the language of 
progressive circles. On Tuesday 
night, we will be hosting an event 
called “Equating Zionism with 
Nazism: A Modern Form of Anti-
Semitism,” at which we will 
hear Heidi Budaj, the Michigan 
regional director of the Anti-
Defamation 
League, 
discuss 

ways in which anti-Semitism 
is expressed today. We invite 
all those who are interested in 
learning about this tough issue 
to join us at 9:00 p.m. in 1230 
Weill Hall, in the Ford School of 
Public Policy.

SAFE, don’t fall for Spencer’s trap

The comeback: It’s an art. 
From the initial scuddlebud 
that piques the interests of 
fans and non-fans alike, to 
the hype-inducing, typically 
mysterious 
marketing 
campaign, to the content itself, 
an artist’s comeback is best 
received when all facets of 
the release are well executed. 
When done poorly, a comeback 
can leave fans disappointed, 
unenthused and in denial (i.e. 
Britney Spears’s Glory — I 
didn’t even know she dropped 
a comeback album in 2016). 
When done well, a comeback 
can shatter the music world, 
reinvigorating the passion of a 
fanbase by reminding listeners 
of an artist’s unparalleled and 
natural talent. An example? 
Justin Timberlake and his 
highly anticipated album, Man 
of the Woods.
With 
a 
teaser 
trailer 
depicting the wind-stricken 
wilderness 
and 
advertising 
a 
return 
to 
Timberlake’s 
Tenn. roots, fans had little 
idea what to expect from 
Woods. He couldn’t possibly 
be releasing a country album, 
right? The project’s first single, 
“Filthy,” 
confused 
listeners 

even more, boasting a sexy, 
abrasive, future-funk sound 
that produced mixed feelings 
and didn’t seem to mirror the 
wholesome, woodsy vibe JT 
was marketing. However, one 
listen through will put these 
concerns at bay; Woods is 
sonically superb. Throughout 
the 16-track record, Timberlake 
manages 
to 
successfully 
incorporate layers of that good 

ole country comfort on which 
he was raised with modern, 
bass-heavy sounds, all while 
maintaining the tight groove 
and impressive vocals that 
shot him to R&B and pop 
superstardom in the 2000s.
The 
former 
NSYNC 
heartthrob best described the 
album’s sound in a behind-
the-scenes 
video, 
labeling 
it “modern Americana with 
808s.” Timberlake built nearly 
every song around guitar and 
country melodies to hone a 
feeling 
of 
“heritage,” 
later 
enlisting Pharrell, Timbaland 
and others to masterfully blend 
those sounds with pop and hip 
hop.
This 
unique 
combination 
is 
likely 
most 
evident 
in 
the 
album’s 
second 
single, 
“Supplies.” The song’s melody 
could easily be accompanied 
by a banjo and a two-step 
stomp for a linedance at the 

hottest barn in Ala., but it’s 
instead met with a booming 
trap beat that Future could 
murder, and in true JT fashion, 
the hook is embedded in the 
listener’s head after just one 
listen (Tyler, the Creator will 
be the first to tell you that the 
track absolutely bumps). This 
genre-bending trend can even 
be seen through the album’s 
features: R&B sensation Alicia 
Keys adds soul to “Morning 
Light,” and country star Chris 
Stapleton immediately follows 
with country twang on “Say 
Something.”
Timberlake has never been 
known for conscious lyricism 
or enlightening messages (see: 
“SexyBack” or “Suit and Tie”), 
so don’t bother looking for 
that here; his brand is simply 
good, groovy music, and that 
doesn’t change with Woods. 
With that said, listeners can 
still take away one major theme 
from this vanguard album: the 
fluidity of genre. Timberlake, 
a white man who made waves 

in a genre largely dominated 
by African American artists, 
has never been one to stick 
to 
stereotypes, 
but 
this 
album goes a step further to 
demonstrate that even country 

and hip hop — seemingly polar 
opposites in both music and 
culture — can be united on 
the grounds of the feel-good 
emotions they can respectively 
produce.
Timberlake 
touched 
on 
this idea in 2016 in a string 
of defensive and explanatory 
tweets after receiving backlash 
to his comments on Jesse 
Williams’s 
Humanitarian 
Award acceptance speech at 
the BET Awards. After initially 
sharing via Twitter that he 
was inspired by Williams’s 
words, Timberlake responded 
to accusations by one tweeter 
that his success was due to 
appropriation of Black culture, 
tweeting, “Oh, you sweet soul. 
The more you realize that we 
are the same, the more we 
can have a conversation. Bye.” 
Predictably, 
this 
comment 
received major backlash, as 
many viewed it as blindness 
to 
Timberlake’s 
potential 
privilege as a white male in 
the historically Black R &B 
music world. These criticisms 
are absolutely valid; however, 
perhaps what Timberlake was 
trying to articulate is that 
there is more in music that 
unites people than divides 
people. Man of the Woods, 
with its bright guitar riffs and 
heavy bass drops, is a properly 
delivered 
version 
of 
this 
message.

The 
depictions 
of 
body 
image 
have 
transgressed 
our 
perspective 
about 
health for quite some time. 
Directly affected by social 
media, 
pop 
culture 
and 
societal norms, body image 
is a concept most of us have 
grappled with or questioned 
at some point or another. 
Everyone’s 
perspective 
and 
experience with their body is 
individualistic; 
nonetheless, 
the aspects of our human 
bodies 
are 
consistently 
categorized. “Fat,” “skinny,” 
“curvy,” “lanky,” “muscular,” 
— the list can go on. Although 
these categories are restricting 
and iniquitous, we are seeing 
these 
descriptions 
become 
redefined, 
specifically 
in 
media.
A few friends and a mentor 
of mine recommended I watch 
the show “This is Us,” the 
Emmy award-winning drama 
on NBC involving a uniquely-
structured 
family 
through 
generations. Each character in 
the Pearson family faces their 
own independent and familial 
intricacies, crafting a dynamic 
and 
approachable 
cast 
of 
characters. 
Kate 
Pearson 
(Chrissy 
Metz, 
“American 
Horror Story”) plays a 36-year-
old, overweight woman who 
battles each day with her diet 
and physical health.
After 
watching 
just 
the 
first 
two 
episodes 
I 
was 
drawn to Kate’s raw and 
honest character, where she 
represents a large population of 
people struggling with weight 
loss. Her character, however, 
doesn’t solely highlight an 
overweight woman consumed 
by her eating habits: The show 
follows her in her everyday 
life 
among 
family, 
friends 
and significant others. The 

viewers are left with a tricky 
blend 
of 
realistic 
human 
challenges 
and 
caricature-
like stereotypes, creating a 
character that feels real in the 
most fabricated fashion.
In 
the 
episodes 
I’ve 
watched so far, weight loss 
and a healthier lifestyle are 
the driving goals for Kate’s 
character. 
Even 
more, 
she 
confronts this issue in all 
types of situations — like 

weighing 
herself 
in 
the 
bathroom, going out on a date 
with another overweight man, 
being conscious of what she 
eats/drinks and facing her 
anxieties surrounding sex and 
romantic relationships.
In all of its efforts, the show 
does a nice job at designing 
and 
portraying 
a 
realistic 
character like Kate. Her initial 
actions in the pilot episode 
include throwing out all of 
her junk food, hitting the gym 
and counting her calories — 
actions which many viewers 
can relate to. Kate is seen 
joining a weight-loss support 
group 
and 
meeting 
Toby 
(Chris Sullivan, “Guardians 
of the Galaxy Vol.2”), another 
overweight man with a light-

hearted sense of humor and a 
strong attraction to Kate. 
Both characters play out the 
similarities and differences 
of individualistic weight loss. 
While Toby wants dessert at 
dinner, Kate refuses. At the 
gym, Kate watches the uber-
skinny girls on the treadmill, 
while 
Toby 
convinces 
her 
to leave the gym with him. 
In what felt like the most 
hard-hitting 
moment, 
Toby 
asks her to fool around, and 
she anxiously breaks down, 
ashamed of the idea of someone 
seeing her naked body. 
What the show does best 
is presenting how difficult it 
is to lose weight and to live a 
certain 
lifestyle, 
especially 
at Kate’s size and body type. 
Sure, we can try and imagine 
what 
someone 
like 
Kate’s 
life would be like. But when 
it’s on the screen — raw and 
sentimental 
— 
Kate’s 
life, 
especially for those of us who 
share immense commonalities 
with her character, is a wakeup 
call to our society’s ignorance 
on weight, health and body 
image. It doesn’t only directly 
affect you in the kitchen or at 
the gym: Challenges like Kate’s 
are constantly rattling in the 
mind, minute to minute, and 
this struggle makes an effect 
on almost every decision.
For so long, the media has 
rarely highlighted the lives of 
those who battle with things 
like eating disorders or obesity. 
Rarely 
are 
larger 
people 
leading characters in film 
and television, especially in 
female roles. It’s actresses like 
Chrissy Metz and the creators 
of “This is Us” who have set 
a new bar for depicting the 
realities of extreme lifestyles 
and redefining the categories 
of body image. 

Does this angle make me 
look fat?

It’s no secret: Modern art 
gets a bad rap. While obviously 
appreciated within its own 
academic 
and 
professional 
circles, it’s safe to say that 
many don’t find modern art 
as profoundly moving as film, 
music 
or 
literature. 
Often 
smeared as pretentious and 
inaccessible, modern art still 

has difficulty shaking the 
image of a turtlenecked, white-
haired Andy Warhol. Enter 
street muralist JR and New 
Wave director Agnès Varda, 
two French artists who joined 
together with an idea: make 
a film showcasing a uniquely 
human facet of modern art 
that 
saves 
memories 
from 
antiquity and reaches people 
from all walks of life. Despite 
their 56-year age difference, 
the two are united through 
art and a shared vision. In the 
early scenes of the film, Agnès 
explains the magnetism she 
felt through JR’s murals and 
her desire to collaborate with 
him; to make art “together, 
but differently.” The result 
is a gorgeous, moving film 
that shatters the purported 
headiness 
of 
modern 
art, 
instead showing the power 
with which it touches the soul 
and brings people together.
Over the course of the film, 
the pair journeys through 
the 
French 
countryside, 
photographing a wide array 
of people from all types of 

backgrounds. 
One 
of 
the 
film’s greatest triumphs is 
its ability to portray even the 
darkest parts of the world 
with beauty and joy. The 
two 
visit 
a 
neighborhood 
of abandoned houses, once 
the home of coal miners and 
their 
families, 
where 
the 
neighborhood’s sole remaining 
occupant — Jeannine, a coal 
miner’s daughter — lives alone 
out of sheer stubbornness. 
Agnès and JR create massive, 
two-story 
murals 
of 
the 
miners who once lived in the 
neighborhood. When Jeannine 
sees the finished product, 
she breaks down in tears as 
Agnès comforts her, “It’s not 
sad, Jeannine. It’s beautiful.” 
Agnès and JR create stunning, 
immensely personal homages 
to bygone people and things 
that tug at the heartstrings of 
factory workers and art critics 
alike.
When describing why she 
has embarked on the project, 
Agnès states, “I fear that each 
face I meet may be my last.” 
There’s an obvious foreboding 
to that statement, as she nears 
90 years of age, but she says 
it with a levity that implies a 
different meaning; Agnès is 
documenting the faces of those 
she meets not for her own 
sake, but because someday 
those faces too will be lost to 
time. The film focuses greatly 
on the ephemeral nature of life 
and beauty, but rather than 
lamenting this, it celebrates it. 
At one point, the two travel to 
Normandy to create a massive 
mural — an image of a young 
man sitting on a dock — on 
the face of an abandoned Nazi 
bunker. At high tide, the mural 
is washed away completely and 
the bunker remains. While it 
may have seemed like a futile 

gesture, it’s a perfect example 
of what “Faces Places” is all 
about: Two people looking 
to find the beauty in a harsh, 
violent world and highlight it, 
if only for a little bit.
Toward 
the 
film’s 

conclusion, JR creates a mural 
of Agnès’s eyes on the side 
of a train. He looks at her, 
smiling, and says, “This train 
will go places you’ve never 
been.” So too will art, once 
created, reach people one has 
never met; move them in ways 
one cannot fully understand. 
There’s 
a 
kind 
of 
joyful 
madness to Agnès and JR’s 
battle against the weathering 
forces of time. In the end, 
there will always be pain and 
suffering, but “Faces Places” 
shows that so long as there are 
two people with a camera, a 
vision and a love for living, the 
world can be a beautiful place.

Imagine this: It’s Wednesday, 

Nov. 9th. Trump has just won the 
2016 presidential election, and the 
results are not what you expected. 
So, like you’ve been planning for 
the past few weeks — regardless of 
the election’s outcome — you buy a 
ticket and get on a cross-country 
bound Amtrak to gain perspective. 
You leave your phone at home.

The news you receive during 

these weeks of travel comes only 
from the individuals you interact 
with on trains, occurring mostly 
during meal times in dining cars. 
As a single rider, you are, for each 
meal, randomly placed at the next 
available spot at the next available 
table. You don’t know anyone else 
aboard the train.

Conversations 
ensue 
and 

relationships begin, with stories 
of lifetime hardships and beauty 
and reasons for traveling at the 
center of dialogue over vegetable 
medley and black coffee. You 
internalize these conversations 
— you study them, and you try to 
understand each person’s views 
and experiences and truths. And 
then, you write songs about them.

For 
Gabriel 
Kahane, 
this 

experience was reality. For two 
weeks, Kahane set out to see the 
U.S. in one of its most raw and 
historically rich forms and to 
speak with individuals he met 
along the way who both agreed 
and disagreed with his political 
beliefs — without (most of the time, 
anyway) explicitly mentioning his 
stance. He took these strangers’ 
words and turned them into 
poetry, turned them into a kind of 
literature not often seen and not 
often braved: performance.

In his piece, “8980 Book of 

Travelers,” 
Kahane 
recounts 

his cross-country journey — all 
8,980 miles of it — through song, 
which he performed at the Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theatre last Friday. 
His 
singer-songwriter 
roots 

show through in this 65 minute 
performance, but the show is 
not simply a concert. Kahane 
assumes the role of a storyteller, 
describing the stories of those he 
met from first person perspective. 
As he sings, three large screens 
display moving video footage of 
America. The clips create an effect 
that makes it seem as though 
the audience is looking out the 
window of a moving train.

While relatively short, “Book of 

Travelers” evokes a wide range of 
emotions. Kahane is funny, with 
a dry sense of humor that speaks 
to his quiet brilliance. Following 
the opening song — almost an 
overture, if you will — the show 
began with Kahane breaking the 
fourth wall, commenting on the 
current “summer weather” we’re 
having here in Ann Arbor. The 
audience was quick to respond 
with ringing laughter, establishing 
a presence and energy that 
significantly added to the overall 
experience. He then segued into 
his first song, a piece that narrated 
the experience he had with a 
decently elderly widow who was 
taking a stab at online dating on 
match.com. His lyrics, quick and 
witty, painted his conversation 
with this woman completely, while 
still leaving much to audience 
interpretation and imagination.

The piece then progresses 

into heavier, more intense songs 
that seamlessly and expertly 
shifted the mood from light to 
serious, depicting instances that 
included aspects of life and death, 
hope and cynicism and even 
Kahane’s 
personal 
experience 

with 
religious 
discrimination 

(and how it was overcome). About 

two thirds of the way through the 
piece, as a sort of climax, Kahane 
stands up from his home base at 
the piano, and as a break from his 
overarching acoustic atmosphere, 
begins incorporating electronic 
music. With a minimalistic drum 
beat in the background, he loops 
his voice and records over himself, 
harmonizing a major triad. The 
recording repeats as he sings 
over it, the sound resembling a 
prayer. He stands in the center 
of the stage and chants: “I am in 
love with America. I am betrayed 
by America. I am dismayed by 
America.” He uses a filter to distort 
his voice, making this section of 
the piece particularly distinct 
from the rest, as if to make these 
three sentences the overarching 
theme of the entire performance. 
It is cathartic.

What the piece never does, 

however, is blatantly mention 
anything political. It is not meant 
to divide, or preach or convince. 
It is meant to spread empathy and 
to subtly implore the importance 
of understanding people. It is 
meant to show that one must try 
to separate the person from their 
ideology.

The show is about people. 

It is about human nature and 
human experience and human 
connection. It is easy to forget, in 
times of stark divide and intense 
political climate, that what people 
want most is to be understood 
and received. But this show helps 
us remember. Perhaps if we all 
took 
a 
phoneless, 
two-week, 

cross-country 
train 
journey 

through America, we would be 
more inclined to take the time 
to understand those who, on the 
surface, may seem different from 
us. But, if we are unable to take 
that trip right now, watching 
this show is a good step in that 
direction.

‘8980 Book of Travelers’: 
A journey to unite nation

COURTESY OF GABRIAL KAHANE

Berlin in the late 1920s was 

a dynamic, fast-paced city with 
a remarkably seedy underbelly. 
As the capital of the Weimar 
Republic (the German state as 
it existed between the end of 
World War I and Hitler’s rise), 
its diverse population channeled 
the trauma from World War I 
into a particularly 
intense 
brand 

of 
hedonism 

and 
criminality. 

“Babylon Berlin,” 
the hit German 
series 
available 

to 
American 

audiences 
through 
Netflix, 

explores the interplay between 
the city’s various factions in a 
frank, unrestrained and thrilling 
manner.

Released originally in Oct. 2017, 

“Babylon Berlin” took Germany 
by storm, drawing numbers of 
viewers only surpassed by “Game 
of Thrones” and supposedly 
costing more than any German 
TV series ever made. The show 
follows Gereon Rath (Volker 
Bruch, “Generation War”), a 
police inspector from Cologne. 
Traumatized by his experiences 
in the war, he is assigned to 
investigate a complicated web of 
threats and blackmail involving 
a pornographic film. Charlotte 

Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries, “Und 
morgen Mittag bin ich tot”), 
a poor police typist who also 
spends her nights working at a 
gritty club, crosses paths with 
Rath and eventually becomes his 
assistant as he works through the 
capital.

While 
the 
plot 
mainly 

focuses on Rath and Ritter, it 
encompasses a sprawling variety 
of topics ranging from a Soviet 
smuggling operation to conflicts 

within the Berlin 
mafia. 
However, 

what seems to rise 
above all of the 
plotlines 
is 
the 

city of Berlin itself. 
Each 
individual 

story dives into 

a different aspect of the city’s 
collective psyche in the postwar 
era, depicting the different ways 
in which people tried to escape 
the trauma from the war. Rath 
indulges in drugs, while many 
retreat into extremely hedonistic 
establishments such as Moka Efti, 
the nightclub where Ritter works. 
The sets and costumes that depict 
scenes of life in 1920s Berlin are 
painstakingly detailed and imbue 
a sense of vibrancy, going beyond 
simply being pleasant to look at. 
The environment in the city is 
reminiscent of 1970s New York, 
as shown in the HBO series “The 
Deuce,” with increased social 
freedom but a layer of moral and 
physical degradation.

Despite the dizzying array 

of plotlines and characters, the 
show moves along at a quick pace, 
but still leaves enough room to 
take it all in and feel the energy 
and chaos of Weimar Berlin. Rath 
and Ritter, the two main subjects 
of the show, naturally stand out 
from the pack. Bruch is capable 
of conveying a wide range of 
emotion and internal turmoil 
with little dialogue, and Fries 
convincingly portrays Ritter as a 
young woman taking advantage 
of her society’s increased social 
freedoms to unshackle herself 
from the wretched life in the 
tenements that she is used to.

The main concern to be 

expected with a show such as 
“Babylon Berlin” is whether 
it will drown under its own 
ambition. 
It 
immediately 

dives into several seemingly 
disconnected plotlines. While 
they 
do 
thoroughly 
explore 

different 
facets 
of 
Weimar 

Berlin, the question remains 
as to whether the show can tie 
them together cohesively and not 
create the sense that it could have 
benefited from a tighter narrative 
structure.

Overall, the pilot paints an 

intriguing and stylish portrait 
of a city and period of time that 
is rarely explored in popular 
culture, and it is worth exploring 
further to see how the seeds were 
planted for a more infamous 
period to come.

‘Berlin’ is stylish, complex

I was studying with my friend 

the other day and all of a sudden 
got a craving for plantains (for 
these purposes we will call them 
platanos, which is Spanish for 
plantains). I longed for the taste 
of platanos, prepared in both 
sweet or savory ways, so much 
that my mouth began to salivate 
at the very thought of having 
any kind of platano dish in front 
of me. I took out my phone and 
tried to find places that sold any 
type of platano in Ann Arbor, 
and I learned that, despite 
having many Latin and Spanish 
food places, the closest place that 
would appease my craving was 
in Detroit — an hour away from 
Ann Arbor. My heart dropped.

Now, you are probably just 

thinking to yourself: “So what? 
Just eat a banana, they are 
practically 
the 
same.” 
Even 

though I could have satiated my 
craving for something sweet or 
savory with another food that 
is similar, it isn’t the same. It is 
taunting to have so many Latin 
and Spanish themed food places 
in Ann Arbor that only sell 
burritos, tacos, rice or beans. 

The food culture of Ann Arbor 
is just one of the small ways 
in which the current culture 
misrepresents the Latin culture.

Food in Latin America is 

an 
art. 
Our 

entire 
culture 

surrounds 
our 

food. 
While 

that food does 
contain 
rice, 

beans 
and 

goya 
seasoned 

meat, it means 
so much more 
than just these 
ingredients 
to 

our community. 
Growing 
up, 

every adult in my 
family, male or 
female, was an 
incredible cook. 
We are masters 
of goya, platanos, 
meat, rice, beans 
and 
so 
much 

more. We create 
dishes made for 
sharing around a large table. Our 
food brings us together. After 
long days of work and school, 
my family always made sure to 
sit around the dining room table 
with our arroz y habichuelas to 
unite once again in the presence 
of 
the 
aromas 
of 
cilantro, 

culantro, garlic and pepper.

Our food is so much more 

than rice and beans and meat. 
It is seasoning, it is all of these 
ingredients 
and 
more 
that 

go 
masterfully 

together 
in 
a 

stew-like 
dish 

called sancocho or 
seafood and rice 
in a dish called 
paella. And it is 
platanos.

Educating 

ourselves 
about 

other 
cultures 

starts with food. 
With the amount 
of 
people 
in 

Ann Arbor from 
around the globe, 
we need to make 
sure that everyone 
can find a taste of 
home 20 minutes 
from 
their 

doorstep, 
rather 

than an hour away 
in Detroit. Food 

is an art that is not only central 
to the Latin culture, but to most 
other cultures as well. My hope is 
that one day when I am studying 
with a friend, craving platanos, I 
can order mangoo or maduros to 
go as easily as I am able to order 
feta bread.

For the Wolverines, the final stretch is the key

They say the hardest part of a 

marathon is the final stretch — the 
period when you’ve come so far and 
have overcome obstacles, yet feel too 
exhausted to finish.

The difficulties of this last stage 

are prevalent in basketball and were 
apparent in the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s performance last 
season.

About a year ago, the Wolverines 

were thriving and looked well on 
their way to the NCAA Tournament. 
But then, things took a turn.

Michigan lost three of its last 

four contests of the 2016-17 regular 
season, wasting all the momentum it 
had built up. It didn’t stop there; the 
Wolverines were then eliminated 
in their first game of the Big Ten 
Tournament by Michigan State. Due 
to their lackluster end-of-season 
performances, they fell through the 
rankings and failed to qualify for the 
NCAA Tournament for the fourth 

time in a row.

As Michigan knows, while the 

final stretch is typically the hardest, 
it is often the most important. This 
is again the case this season for the 
21st-ranked Wolverines (8-4 Big 
Ten, 19-6 overall).

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico’s squad was having one 
of the best seasons in program 
history and reached No. 13 in the 
national rankings. The defense — 
which allows the second-fewest 
points per game in the Big Ten, 
with 61 — excelled, led by senior 
forward Jillian Dunston who has a 
team-high 45 steals. On top of that, 
the offense finally started to find 
its groove with senior Katelynn 
Flaherty running the point, and the 
team looked to have left its turnover 
problems in the past.

Again, things have changed.
In the fourth quarter against 

Purdue last Thursday, Michigan 
gave up a 16-point lead and fell short 
in overtime. The loss killed the 
Wolverines’ six-game win streak 

and with it, their confidence.

Michigan stumbled again the 

following Sunday in Piscataway, 
falling to Rutgers, 63-56.

One loss wouldn’t have been too 

detrimental, but two in a row is 
problematic. The Wolverines have 
fallen eight spots in the national 
rankings and slipped from second to 
fifth in the Big Ten standings.

With just four games remaining 

in the regular season, Michigan is 
once again in the midst of a tough 
closing stretch. What happens in 
these remaining contests — against 
Northwestern, 
Michigan 
State, 

Minnesota and No. 10 Maryland — 
will make or break the season.

Win out and the problems go 

away, but that will be hard to do. 
Though the Wolverines stomped 
the Spartans in their first meeting, 
the next matchup will be in East 
Lansing, and Michigan State will 
be hungry for revenge. The contest 
against the Terrapins will be 
even more challenging — they are 
undoubtedly the best team in the 

conference with their high-scoring 
offense and skilled rebounding.

Too 
many 
avoidable 
losses, 

and 
Tournament 
dreams 
will 

be jeopardized. Last year, the 
Wolverines notched 22 regular 
season wins, yet didn’t qualify for 
the NCAA Tournament. They 
currently have 19, and are in a 
similar position.

For Michigan to make the most of 

what’s left of the season, its offense 
must shape up. Against the Scarlet 
Knights, the Wolverines scored 20 
points less than their season average 
and had 26 turnovers. These 
substandard stats won’t be good 
enough for the tough road ahead.

Michigan is at the 20-mile mark 

in the race and can sniff the finish 
line. If the Wolverines give up now, 
they’ll end up just like last year — 
having nothing to show for their 
season’s early success.

But if they find that last ounce of 

strength to sprint the remaining few 
miles, their tournament dreams just 
may come true.

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily

The Michigan women’s basketball team found out last year that the end of the season can be the most important part. Now it’s in a similar situation.

The continuous rise of Dakota Raabe

It started with his first career 

goal just three weeks ago.

After going scoreless — and 

pointless — in the Michigan 
hockey team’s first 23 games, 
forward Dakota Raabe finally 
broke through with a game-winner 
against then-No. 12 Penn State.

With the goal came a sense of 

relief. And with that, a newfound 
confidence manifested.

The freshman has fired eight 

shots in his past five games after 
just 13 in his first 16. In that span, 
he’s posted three points — two 
goals and an assist — and increased 
ice time on both special team units 
after flying completely under the 
radar through December.

“I’ve been hanging onto the 

puck a little more,” Raabe said. 
“I’ve been able to make better 
plays instead of just throwing (the 
puck) away like I felt I was doing 
before.”

The same can be said about 

making a difference on the ice. 

Instead of throwing away his 
chance to get significant minutes, 
Raabe has stepped up since that 
first goal, and coaches, teammates 
and opponents have noticed. No 
longer is his status in the lineup a 
question mark, and watching from 
the press box as a healthy scratch 
seems to be behind him.

It was during Friday night’s 5-3 

victory over then-No. 18 Wisconsin 
when the Capistrano Beach, Ca. 
native truly solidified his role on 
a No. 19 Michigan team vying to 
qualify for postseason play.

A high-energy presence on the 

penalty kill unit, Raabe forced 
a handful of turnovers in the 
Badgers’ defensive zone. Two 
resulted in Wisconsin penalties, 
which stifled the visitors’ power 
play opportunities.

A 
roughing 
call 
halfway 

through the first period sent 
junior forward Brendan Warren 
to the box and the penalty kill 
onto the ice for the first time. The 
Badgers looked ready to strike 
for the second time in the frame, 
controlling the puck in their 

offensive zone and not allowing 
the Wolverines quality chances to 
clear.

But with 20 seconds left on 

the power play, Raabe stole 
the puck near the neutral zone 
for a breakaway and potential 
shorthanded goal. To stop the 
speedster, Wisconsin committed 
a hooking penalty, leading to four-
on-four play. And on the ensuing 
Michigan 
power 
play, 
junior 

defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi’s 

wrist shot from the left circle 
found the back of the net, tying the 
game at one apiece.

During the second period, the 

Badgers threatened on another 
man advantage, outworking the 
Wolverines and trying to fight 
back from a 3-1 deficit.

That’s when Raabe jumped in 

for his next penalty kill shift.

With 37 seconds remaining 

on the power play, the 5-foot-9 
forward sped past Wisconsin 
defenders to meet goaltender Jack 
Berry behind the net. Unable to 
fully clear the puck from the zone, 
Berry flattened Raabe, pushing 

him into the ice with two hands 
and sitting on top of him in front 
of the crease. But the referee was 
right there, calling the netminder 
for holding, effectively ending the 
Badgers’ power play in its tracks.

A visibly frustrated Berry was 

serenaded by mocking “Berry” 
chants from the Michigan faithful. 
Raabe, on the other hand, was 
noticeably fired up, skating off the 
ice with a swagger hidden over the 
first months of the season. He was 
greeted at the bench by teammates 
and coaches slapping his helmet 
and patting him on the back, 
commending his hustle when the 
Wolverines needed it most.

It was only fitting that with one 

minute to go in regulation, the 
ravenous Raabe poked the puck 
away from a Badger skater and 
was rewarded with an empty-net 
goal to seal the deal.

After killing six of seven power 

plays, the next night, Raabe was 
promoted to play on the same 
line as junior Jake Slaker and 
freshman Josh Norris, the most 
productive forward tandem the 

past month. And just like Friday, 
Raabe’s quick clears from the zone 
and hostile defense on the penalty 
kill muted Wisconsin’s power play 
when he was on the ice.

“His growth has been huge,” 

said Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“You can see he can skate. He’s 
starting to skate now and I think 
that’s what everything starts with. 
Stalking on loose pucks, just doing 
the things that we ask him to do.”

Pearson notes Raabe’s keen 

sense for smart and situational 
hockey, his work ethic on both 
sides of the puck and his speed 
— important characteristics to 
Pearson, who stresses a faster 
pace of play — as keys to his 
renaissance.

Not only has Raabe’s self-

assurance 
increased 
during 

the back half of the season, but 
Pearson’s 
confidence 
in 
the 

youngster has also blossomed.

Pearson admits he didn’t feel 

comfortable having Raabe on the 
ice in late-game situations early 
in the season. But after the recent 
uptick in performance, the coach 
is now willing to call No. 12 much 
more often.

“He’s not a freshman anymore,” 

Pearson said. “He’s one of those 
guys who came back after the 
break and has really stepped his 
game up. And good for him and 
now he’s got some confidence. 
… He may not be the biggest guy 
on the ice, but he plays big and 
he makes a big difference on our 
team.”

‘M’ beats MSU in final 
home meet of the year

Canham 
Natatorium 
was 

filled with waves of talent and 
excitement 
on 
Friday 
night. 

The No. 3 Michigan women’s 
swimming 
and 
diving 
team 

finished its season with a 10-0 
record, beating in-state rival 
Michigan State with a final score 
of 187-89. The Wolverines claimed 
their first undefeated season in 20 
years.

The women took first place in 13 

of the 15 events. 
The Wolverines 
dominated 
the meet early 
on 
with 
1-2-3 

touches in the 
first two events 
of the meet – the 
200-yard IM and 
400-yard medley 
relay.

The 
juniors 

helped 
tally 

up some points with first-place 
victories from both Becca Postoll 
and Taylor Garcia. Postoll touched 
with a time of 2:03.91 in the 200-
yard IM and 1:48.92 in the 200-
yard freestyle. Garcia placed first 
in the 50-yard backstroke (25.31) 
and 100-yard butterfly (54.69).

The seniors also carried their 

weight with top finishes in a 
number of individual events. 
Emily Kopas placed first in the 
50-yard breaststroke (28.35) and 
Samantha Yeo won the 100-yard 
IM (55.96).

“We’re seeing a pretty good 

team,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Mike Bottom. “We saw some best 
shaved times tonight, which is fun 
for coaches to see. The fight is not 
about beating someone. It’s about 
swimming fast and they did a 
great job at that.”

In addition to a successful 

competition, the team celebrated 
its senior night for the seven 
graduating 
student 
athletes. 

Friends and family from across 
the country gathered in Ann 
Arbor to attend the last home 
meet of the season.

“It’s a special night,” said 

senior Clara Smiddy. “We’ve 
been through four years of this 
group of seniors. It has been an 
incredible ride, ups and downs the 
whole way. And to bring it back 
in Canham is definitely an honor. 
And with a huge crowd tonight, 
it’s a lot of fun.”

Michigan 
also 
welcomed 

back several Olympian alumni, 

including 
Melinda 
Harrison 
and 
gold-

medalist 
Ginny 

Duenkel. 
These 

individuals were 
recognized 
for 

their 
Olympic 

achievements 
during a small 
ceremony 
halfway through 

the meet.

“This is the first time I’ve been 

back in 10 years,” Duenkel said. “It 
feels like I’m back home again. I 
love this place.”

The Wolverines are preparing 

for the Big Ten Championships 
next month. Michigan is currently 
the reigning Big Ten Champion, 
hoping to reclaim the title for a 
third consecutive year.

With just two meets before the 

season closes, some swimmers 
are thinking about swimming 
beyond the collegiate level. Many 
swimmers 
have 
aspirations 

to compete in the upcoming 
Olympics. However, other seniors 
are declaring the end to their 
swimming career after the Big 
Ten Championships.

“After college I hopefully will 

take the summer off,” Smiddy 
said. “I’ll be done with college 
after swimming. I want to catch 
up with friends and family around 
the country.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Northwestern senior guard Bryant McIntosh

It’s been a trying season for the 

Northwestern men’s basketball 
team.

The Wildcats made the NCAA 

Tournament 
last 
season 
for 

the first time in school history. 
They won their first round game 
against Vanderbilt, and came 
close to beating Gonzaga, the 
eventual national championship 
runner-up.

Northwestern 
might 
have 

even won that game if it weren’t 
for a missed call. The Bulldogs’ 
Zach Collins blocked a layup 
from Wildcat Dererk Pardon, 
but Collins’ hand was inside the 
basket. The NCAA later admitted 
the play should have been called 
for goaltending. Northwestern 

was down five with five minutes 
left in the game, and there’s 
no telling what would have 
transpired if the call had been 
made differently. Still, the play 
left the Wildcats 
wondering, what 
could have been.

Since 
then, 

things have taken 
a turn for the 
worse. 

The 

celebration 
of 

the 
Cinderella 

team from last 
year is gone, and 
what’s left is a 
middling, 14-10 team running 
out of opportunities to prove 
itself worthy of another NCAA 
Tournament bid.

The 
stark 
decline 
in 

Northwestern’s production is a 
surprise considering it returned 
four of its five starters from last 
season. One of those returners, 
guard Bryant McIntosh, was 

pegged to be one 
of the best players 
in the conference.

McIntosh 

was one of just 
three unanimous 
selections 
for 

the 
preseason 

All-Big Ten team 
— 
along 
with 

Michigan State’s 
Miles 
Bridges 

and Wisconsin’s 

Ethan Happ. McIntosh flourished 
in the NCAA Tournament last 
season, scoring 25 and 20 points, 
respectively, in the Wildcats’ two 
games.

Since 
then, 
McIntosh’s 

production, like his team’s, has 
declined. He’s averaging over 
two points fewer per game this 
season, and he hasn’t shown as 
many 
flashes 

of brilliance as 
before, 
scoring 

over 20 points in 
just three games 
all season.

The 
Daily 

sat 
down 
with 

McIntosh at Big 
Ten Media Day in 
October — before 
things 
started 

to go wrong for 
Northwestern — to discuss how 
things had changed in Evanston, 
how expectations had affected 
the team and how last season’s 
game against Michigan propelled 

the Wildcats into the tournament.

The Michigan Daily: As you’ve 

become more successful, and the 
team’s become more successful, 
is there any more added pressure 

involved?

Bryant 

McIntosh: 
I 

don’t think it’s 
pressure. I don’t 
think any of us 
look at it. I think 
it’s something we 
kind of expect 
to 
be 
honest. 

We think we’ve 
earned it. It’s just 
kind of something 

that we look at as, ‘We deserve it.’ 
We’ve put in enough work. I think 
our resume from the previous 
year shows that we’re one of 
the better teams coming back. 
We also realize that we do have 
a lot of guys coming back, but 
just because it says we should be 
good on paper doesn’t guarantee 
it. Like, we still have to continue 
to work and be hungry and still 
attack the days to prepare for this 
season.

TMD: As there has been more 

success 
with 
Northwestern 

basketball, has there been a 
culture change, not even on the 
team, but around campus?

BM: 
We’re 
probably 

recognized more on campus. 
Like, fans didn’t follow us when 
I first got to campus. But the best 
story I have for you is having a 
student hang (a picture of) the 
goaltending of Zach Collins on 
the shot last year. That speaks 
to just how much the culture 
has changed at Northwestern 
— having fans that really are 
invested and care. That’s probably 
the best fan story I have for you.

TMD: 
Last 
year 
against 

Michigan was obviously a huge 
game. When that happened, 
did you know, ‘Alright, we 
have a better chance of the 
tournament?’

BM: Yeah, I think we all kind 

of knew that we needed to win 
one more — one more game — to 
kind of ensure that we were in. 
And there was some pressure 
on us, but we kind of addressed 
it right before that game, and 
just said, ‘If we want to make 
the tournament, then we’ve got 
to win this game.’ And we won 
that, and then we just continued 
to help our resume in the Big Ten 
Tournament.

TMD: Having had that and the 

NCAA Tournament experience, 
how has that helped the team this 
year?

BM: It’s good. I mean, it just 

makes us even more veteran 
than just having a bunch of 
seniors. We’ve actually already 
been there now. And I think a 
lot of people anticipated this 
being the year that we would go. 
Having that already under our 
belt, having that experience, I 
think, can only be beneficial for 
our next run.

TMD: With your own personal 

accolades, how have you stayed 
focused on the season at hand, 
knowing 
that 
people 
expect 

certain things out of you?

BM: Like I said, the accolades, 

the rankings of our team, it’s 
something we kind of all think 
we deserved and worked for. But 
just because it says it on paper 
doesn’t mean it’s reality. So you 
still have to continue to work. I 
also always go back to the fact 
that I was a three-star recruit 
from the middle of nowhere that 
nobody saw or recognized — 
didn’t think I was that good. And 
I’ve continued to prove people 
wrong. So I understand there’s 
people out there that will see the 
list, and it will motivate them. 
I see the guys on the other list, 
and I allow it to motivate me too. 
I think it will be a good battle 
between the Big Ten guards that 
are on the list and not on the list. 
There’s a lot of great players in 
this league. So it means a lot, but 
it’s preseason still too.

Northwestern guard Bryant McIntosh has seen a difference in the way his team is recognized in Evanston after making the NCAA Tournament last season.

“I think it’s 

something we 
kind of expect 
to be honest.”

“Just because it 
says it on paper 
doesn’t mean 
it’s reality.”

After last season’s Cinderella run, McIntosh discussed expectations for this season with The Daily at Big Ten Media Day

Wolverines prepare for second Northwestern matchup in eight days

It may be an overlooked 

rivalry, but the Michigan and 
Northwestern men’s basketball 
teams have matched up in some 
of the teams’ best games in 
recent memory.

Last year, a miraculous full-

court pass and layup at the 
buzzer gave the Wildcats a 
two-point win, solidifying their 
resume and eventually earning 
them the program’s first-ever 
NCAA Tournament appearance.

A 
season 
earlier, 
it 
was 

Michigan’s late-game heroics 
that brought a postseason bid 
into focus. With three seconds 
left in overtime, former wing 
Zak Irvin drilled a game-winner 
to beat Northwestern in the 2016 
Big Ten Tournament. A day later, 
the Wolverines beat top-seeded 
Indiana to essentially secure 
their tournament berth. 

Yet, the usual drama was 

absent in last Tuesday’s series 
continuum. Instead, it was an 
ugly basketball game that bled to 
finality.

In it, Michigan’s inexperience 

against 
zone 
defenses 
was 

glaring. 
Northwestern’s 
2-3 

matchup 
zone 

made 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offense 
look 

directionless, 
falling 
too 

often 
into 
the 

crux of forced 
improvisation 
late in the shot 
clock.

But 
the 

Wildcats’ scoring 
attack was even 
more dormant. Against a defense 
that proved to be as strong as its 
own, Northwestern sputtered 
to 38-percent shooting and 16 
turnovers. Each team had five-
minute stretches without a point 
in the first half. The Wolverines, 

eventually, schlepped to a 58-47 
victory.

“We didn’t make shots, we 

didn’t make foul shots, but we 
held them and that was the 
key,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein after the game.

Eight 
days 

later, the same 
key applies, as 
the 20th-ranked 
Wolverines (8-4 
Big 
Ten, 
19-6 

overall) embark 
to 
Chicago 

to 
rematch 

Northwestern 
(5-6, 14-10) on 
Tuesday night. 

The 
quick 

turnaround 

between games indicates that 
this final matchup of the regular 
season might look like the first. 
Both teams pride themselves on 
defense and have played only 
once since the last meeting. Yet, 
their respective outlooks have 

changed slightly in the past 
week.

Forty-eight hours after the 

Wildcats couldn’t buy a bucket 
in Ann Arbor, they scorched 
Wisconsin with an 18-1 start for 
an eventual win last Thursday. 
Center 
Dererk 

Pardon, 
who 

was 
relatively 

quiet 
against 

Michigan, 
was 

perfect 
from 

the floor with 17 
points and added 
three blocks.

It 
was 
a 

must-have 
for 

Northwestern, 
which is making 
a late crawl into 
the Tournament picture after 
a slow start. Three wins in four 
games has Beilein cautious about 
the Wildcats.

“Offensively, they put on a 

show, up 18-1 on Wisconsin,” 
Beilein said. “As we all know 
from last year, they have a very 
talented team that has turned 
the corner now.

“I see no reason why they can’t 

go on a run like we did last year. 

They certainly have shown in the 
past that they can beat anybody 
in this league.”

But 
Beilein 
can’t 
be 
as 

enthused about his team’s most 
recent performance.

Michigan’s issues with slow 

starts and free 
throw 
shooting 

nearly cost them 
Saturday against 
Minnesota. 
The Wolverines 
went 
12-for-28 

from the line — 
that’s right: they 
missed 16 free 
throws — which 
allowed 
the 

Golden Gophers 
to send the game 

into overtime.

“We just keep working on 

technique and confidence that 
we’ll do it a little different,” 
Beilein said. “We end every 
practice with these pressure 
free throws, and I have an 
idea tomorrow to make more 
pressure — to end each practice 
with a make instead of a miss, 
which happens too many times.”

And just as it did against 

Northwestern, Michigan again 
looked sluggish to begin play. 
Minnesota controlled and led the 
entire first half — the Wolverines 
have gotten outscored in the 
opening frame in four of their 
last six games.

“There are anxieties at the 

front end of our game that are 
getting in our way,” Beilein 
said. “It’s a lack of focus at the 
beginning of the game.”

So how does Michigan avoid 

those issues Tuesday? It starts 
with 
assertiveness 
and 
new 

plays, according to freshman 
forward Isaiah Livers.

“Just being more aggressive 

off the catch. Northwestern’s 
zone — you have to catch it and 
slice through,” Livers said. “They 
have a terrific zone defense. 
(We’re) working on sets that 
they’ve never seen before — some 
I’ve never seen before today.”

The Wolverines will discover 

the efficacy of those sets Tuesday 
night. For them, it’s another 
chance to improve before March. 
For Northwestern, it’s a must-win.

And 
if 
history 
is 
any 

indication, this game could again 
come down to the wire.
