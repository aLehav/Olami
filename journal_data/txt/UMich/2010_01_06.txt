Domino's CEO played football forBo
Schembechler, served as a University regent

By KYLE SWANSON
DailyNews Editor
Ending a two-month search,
University officials announced
yesterday morning that Domino's
Pizza chairman and CEO David
Brandon will be the next athletic
director.
A search for Athletic Director
Bill Martin's successor began in
October, when Martin - who has
served as athletic director since
2000 - announced his inten-
tion to retire in September 2010.

Though Martin won't officially
retire until Sept. 4, Brandon will
begin his 5-year appointment on
March 8, pending approval from
the Board of Regents at its Jan. 21
meeting.
When Brandon officially takes
the reins on March 8, Martin
will transition to a role as special
advisor to the president until his
retirement in September.
Despite his new role at the Uni-
versity, Brandon - who has served
as Domino's CEO since March
1999 - will continue to serve as

non-executive chairman for Ann
Arbor-based Domino's Pizza. His
position on the board of directors
will not require any day-to-day
responsibilities at the company.
In an exclusive interview with
the Daily yesterday, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
expressed her excitement with
Brandon's decision to accept the
post of athletic director.
"This is a new era, and I think
David Brandon really is positioned
well for the challenges that we're
going to face in the future," Cole-

man said.
Coleman said though there were
many candidates vying for the
position and others were nominat-
ed for it, she felt Brandon's experi-
ence made him the right person for
the job.
"Times are different now than
they were when Bill took over,"
Coleman said of Martin. "I think
(Brandon) has a lotof management
skills that, as the department has
grown and it's become more com-
plicated, we'll need to pull on."

AD post to see 47-percent pay hike

Brandon will
make $560,000
compared with Bill
Martin's $380,000
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
When University officials
announced yesterday that David
Brandon would become the next

Michigan athletic director, they
didn't mention that he would be
receiving a 47-percent increase in
compensation over his predeces-
sor.
While Athletic Director Bill
Martin currently earns $380,000
in base compensation from the
University, University spokes-
woman Kimberly Broekhuizen
told The Michigan Daily yester-
day that Brandon will receive a
base salary of $560,000. Addition-
ally, Athletic Department spokes-

man Bruce Madej said Brandon
would receive $100,000 each year
in deferred compensation.
A University spokesperson had
incorrectly told the Daily yester-
day that Brandon would receive
$525,000 in base pay.
Brandon will also be eligible
to earn performance bonuses
for meeting financial, fundrais-
ing and operational objectives -
though benchmarks have not yet
been established. Madej indicated
performance standards would be

established over the next several
months, but did not comment on
how much Brandon could earn in
performance bonuses.
In an interview last night,
University Regent Andrea Fis-
cher Newman (R-Ann Arbor)
told the Daily that the large salary
increase was the result of a study
of compensation packages for ath-
letic directors at comparable insti-
tutions.

involved in terrorism hoaxes,
espionage and bank robberies has
been a piece of cake for Barbara
McQuade.
At afederal courthouse Monday
WEATHER Hi: 25
TOMORROW L : 20

afternoon, McQuade, 45, was the
first female sworn in to head the
U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit.
As a U.S. attorney, McQuade will
represent the U.S. federal govern-
ment in civil and criminal cases in
the Eastern District of Michigan,
which includes Ann Arbor, Flint
and Port Huron.
In November, President Barack
Obama nominated McQuade, a
Democrat, for the position. The
Senate confirmed her nomination
on Dec. 24.
McQuade will replace U.S.
Attorney Terrance Berg and serve
a four-year term.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily Monday, McQuade said
her days as a University of Michi-

gan student and Daily sports edi-
tor played a major role in getting
her to where she is today.
McQuade received bachelor's
degrees in communications and
economics from the University in
1987 and graduated from the Uni-
sersity's Law School in 1991.
During her time as an under-
graduate, McQuade worked for
the Daily sports section, covering
football, basketball, hockey, vol-
leyball and softball. She also wrote
a column called Barb's Barbs,
where she shared her musings on
the 1985-86 basketball season and
the 1986 Michigan football team.
McQuade ultimately became

Serving supper in sewage

Though Stockwell Resi-
dence Hall now features wire-
less Internet and a renovated
atrium, 26 years ago, problems
with old piping showed a grit-
tier side to the residence hall.
On Sept. 15,1986the Michi-
gan Daily reported that the
Stockwell cafeteria remained
open despite a leak in the
pipes that caused sewage to
leak into the kitchen. Food
service employees said the
cafeteria's failure to close as a
result of the spill was a viola-
tion of public health laws.
Myrna Adee, a food service
supervisor at the time, said
there were problems with
the piping in Stockwell about
every five years because it was
an old building, according to
the article.
Though the sewage did not

reach the area where food
was prepared at first, food
service employees had to
walk through it as they moved
around the kitchen.
A food service employee
at the time who wished to
remain anonymous said she
was ordered to clean the spill
that was on the floor, which
involved piling together the
solid waste and toilet paper
before removing it, according
to the article.
She also said that more
sewage continued to leak out
of the pipes after the waste
was removed.
"(Food) carts were rolling
through shit," she told the
Daily atthe time. "I'm shocked
that they would actually serve
food."
Though employees rec-

ommended the cafeteria be
closed, Mattie Reviere, the
head food service supervi-
sor for Stockwell at the time,
kept the cafeteria open until
the sewage seeped to the food
preparation area, according
to the article. Reviere also
advised employees to keep
quiet about the matter.
Reviere refused to com-
ment at the time about leak
and health violation.
Kevin Besey, an employee
of the University Occupation-
al Safety and Environmental
Health Services told the Daily
at the time that Stockwell
would not lose its food service
license because the health
code violation was an isolated
incident.

Sullivan can't promise cuts won't spike tuition

.

From Page 1A
academic and budgetary affairs,
said in an interview yesterday that
though the cuts could be significant,
officials have long been expecting
large cuts in state funding.
"Nothing we've seen from the
state recently looks any different
from what we've been expecting,"
he said. "Unfortunately, it's a very
difficult picture for the state."
With the cuts in state funding,
Sullivan said that units throughout
campus are likely to feel some of
the pain. But, Sullivan did say that
central units - like those that are
directly overseen by a University
vice president - would be asked to
make cuts before academic units,
as a way to shield students' educa-
tional experiences at the University
from some of the steepest cuts.
In the interview, Sullivan would
not rule out the possibility of a
tuition increase. She did say howev-
er that cost containmentefforts and
central cuts would be made before
any tuition increases or academic
unit cuts were to be considered.

Hanlon also said he couldn't
guarantee that there wouldn't be
an increase in tuition, but added
that University officials are looking
for other ways to absorb the loss in
funding.
"We are engaging (in) an
unprecedented set of initiatives
around cost reductions, efficiency,
and trying to work more effectively
with the dollars we have," he said
in the interview yesterday. "So, I
can't make a prediction on tuition,
except that we're trying to deal
with any reduction in state appro-
priations through our expenditure
side rather than trying to raise rev-
enue."
Sullivan said cost containment
efforts underway at the University
should be able to cover next year's
expected loss in state appropria-
tions over time.
At her annual State of the Uni-
versity address in October, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
called on faculty and staff to double
their efforts to cut costs, announc-
ing plans to cut $100 million from
the University's budget over the

next few years.
Despite the expected loss in state
funding, Hanlon said there's no
reason to believe the University is
turning into a private institution as
some have argued.
"I think that criticism is mis-
guided," he said. "What makes the
University a public university is its
mission, not its funding. I think our
commitment to our public mission
is going to stand firm no matter
what our funding sources are."
Sullivan said that despite the
bad news from the state, she under-
stands the difficult position legisla-
tors are in, citing revenue shortfalls
as a major concern among lawmak-
ers.
"It doesn't mean the state legisla-
ture doesn't like higher education,
it just means they're not getting
enough revenue and they've got
to find something that can be cut
because the constitution requires
a balanced budget," she said. "It's a
very difficult place to be."
Hanlon said that state officials
are taking into consideration the
fact that the federal stimulus funds

will run out by the next fiscal year
leaving a 15 percent shortfall in the
state's general fund.
"What we don't know is how
they'll solve the problem," he said.
When Sullivan appeared at a
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs' meeting on Dec.
14, she warned of dramatic cuts in
state appropriations.
Speaking before SACUA - the
University's leading faculty govern-
ing body - Sullivan cautioned fac-
ulty on what the future may hold.
"I do think we will have an his-
toric cut," Sullivan said of next
year's state appropriations.
In a letter to state lawmak-
ers released on Dec. 14, Coleman
described the role University can
play in the state's economic recov-
ery and outlined efforts underway
at the University to increase stu-
dent access to the school while also
cuttingcosts.
State appropriations to the Uni-
versity have fallen substantially
since the early 2000's. From fiscal
year 2003 to fiscal year 2004, state
appropriations to the University

fell approximately 10 percent -
or $36,356,600. Since that year,
state funding to the University has
remained around $320 to $330 mil-
lion each year.
Though Coleman did not specify
how much money the University
will need from the state, she out-
lined the successes of the Universi-
ty and what cuts may be necessary
in the future.
In her letter, Coleman told legis-
lators that despite the current dif-
ficulties in the state's budget, the
University must remain a top fund-
ing priority in order to better the
state's chances of experiencing an
economic recovery.
Coleman warned state lawmak-
ers that cuts to the University could
have serious consequences for
Michigan's economy.
"We acknowledge the fiscal cir-
cumstances of the state," Coleman
writes. "Nevertheless, the Uni-
versity of Michigan is an essential
component in the stabilization
and revitalization of the Michigan
economy."
"We also play a critical role in

the development and education
of our workforce and cannot risk
jeopardizing the quality of our
instruction, research and service,"
Coleman continued in the letter.
"The impact of the state's historic
contributions to the University
of Michigan's success cannot be
overstated, and we believe that the
state's continued investment in our
success is central to our collective
future.
Coleman also outlined potential
cuts to University programs that
may be necessary, saying, "aggres-
sive policy and organizational
changes will be required."
"Additional cost reductions of
over $22 million are factored into
our FY2010 budget," she wrote.
A draft ofthe letter was approved
bytheUniversity'sBoardofRegents
at their December meeting.
In negotiations last year, state
legislators cut approximately $1.9
billion from this year's budget,
though projections currently esti-
mate lawmakers may need to cut
an additional $1.4 billion from the
state's budget next year.

ANN ARBOR
Patrick Doyle
named Domino s
new CEO
Domino's Pizza Inc. has named
a new CEO to replace David Bran-
don, who is stepping down to
become athletic director at the
University of Michigan.
The pizza delivery chain says
45-year-old Patrick Doyle will
replace Brandon. Doyle joined
the company in 1997 and has been
president of Domino's USA since
2007. Before that he was an execu-
tive at Gerber Products Co.
The 57-year-old Brandon will
stay on with Domino's as a special
adviser for the rest of the year and
will become the pizza chain's non-
executive chairman. Brandon was
the second-ever leader of the com-
pany that was founded in 1960 by
Tom Monaghan.
Domino's says details about the
transition will be completed over
the next several weeks and voted
on at the company's Feb. 24 board
meeting.
LANSING
Mich. dealing with
union reluctance
on schools bid
Michigan officials are hoping
that union hesitance to endorse
new school reforms won't hurt
the state's bid to win more federal
education money.
Local superintendents, school
board presidents and union presi-
dents are being asked to sign
memoranda of understanding
related to the state's efforts to win
up to $400 million in the Obama
administration's Race to the Top
competition. The state wants the
documents this week to include
them in an application due to the
federal government Jan. 19.
Teachers unions are advising
against signing the documents
until they get a better handle on
what will be in the application.
State schools chief Mike Flana-
gan said Tuesday the state will
accept memoranda without union
signatures. But he acknowledged
that could weaken the state's
chances to win the cash.
LANSING
Lansing lawmakers
to discuss budget
process
A bipartisan group of lawmak-
ers from the Lansing area wants
to speed up the state government
budget process and make it easier
for the public to follow.
Three Republicans and two
Democrats from the state House
are scheduled to discuss new leg-
islation related to the state budget
process on Tuesday.
Their proposal calls for making
some aspects of determining state
revenue estimates and target setting
for budget appropriations subject to
Michigan's Open Meetings Act.
The budget process has come

under more scrutiny because state
lawmakers have missed the annual
Oct. 1 budget-balancing deadline
twice in the past three years.
Lawmakers backing the new leg-
islation say they want to make the
budget target-setting process less
secretive.
WASHINGTON
Chairman doubts
Republicans can
retake House
GOP Chairman Michael Steele
thinks Republicans have "screwed
up" for the most part in the years
since Ronald Reagan was presi-
dent. And, he adds in an interview
on the heels of his new book's
release, Republicans won't win
back the House in fall elections
and might not be ready to lead
even if they do.
That forecast of failure sparked
a pushback Tuesday at the GOP's
own National Republican Congres-
sional Committee, whose aim is to
elect Republicans, and delight at its
counterpart, the Democratic Con-
gressional Campaign Committee.
Asked Monday by talk-show
host Sean Hannity if Republicans
can regain the House in Novem-
ber, Steele said, "Not this year." He
6 added: "I don't know yet, because
I don't know all the candidates
yet. We still have some vacancies
that need to get filled, but then the
question we need to ask ourselves
is, if we do that, are we ready?"

Daily wire reports

BRANDON
From Page 1A
ment throughout the University's
administration, Coleman said she
felt financial management would
continue to be an increasingly
important area of focus for the Ath-
letic Department. She added that
Brandon's business background
would enable him to handle the
department's finances well.
Coleman also said she was
impressed with the responses Bran-
don gave during interviews for the
job.
"One of the things that David
talked about during his interviews
was really quite intriguing - how to
enhance our fan experience," Cole-
man said.
"There are all sorts of things we
need to be looking at for the future
because people are going to have
choices about what they do with
their leisure time and we want to
keep people connected to the Uni-
versity," Coleman said, adding that
athletics is a key way to keep people
active in the University community.
Additionally, Coleman said she
was impressed with Brandon's
desire to better align the Athletic
Department with the University's
academic mission.
"We're building pretty good
bridges already, but we could
strengthen those bridges," Coleman
said of the relationship between ath-
letics and academics.
However, Coleman admitted that
though she valued Brandon's busi-
ness savvy, it was ultimately his
demonstrated ability to unite peo-
ple behind a common purpose that
impressed her most.
"I was very intrigued by that sort
of quality that he has to bring out the
best in people and move organiza-
tions forward," she said. "That ulti-
mately iswhat persuaded me that he
could take those skills into the set-
ting of intercollegiate athletics."
Looking to the future, Coleman
said she believes Brandon will be
able to strengthen the University's
relationship with the NCAA and the
Big Ten Conference.
"I've talked tohimaboutmy desire
for him to become really engaged
with the issues of the Big Ten con-
ference and also at the NCAA,"
Coleman said. "I'd like Michigan to
have a seat at the table when a lot of
those decisions are made and Dave
Brandon will be, I think, avery pow-
erful voice for Michigan."
Though the final selection was
Coleman's and hers alone, a small
committee -including Provost Tere-
sa Sullivan, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer Tim Slot-
tow, Michigan basketball coach John
Beilein, Education Prof. and faculty

athletic representative to the Big 10
and NCAA Percy Bates and Direc-
tor of the Life Sciences Institute Liz
Barry - was formed to advise her on
possible replacements.
Briefing members of the press
from the athletic director's confer-
ence room in Weidenbach Hall,
Brandon expressed his excitement
for the new position.
"I'm the athletic director of the
University of Michigan. I'm proud to
do that," Brandonsaid. "I've commit-
ted to the University for a minimum
of five years and I hope that gets
extended. This is whatI want to do."
Asked about his role at Domino's,
Brandon said he was happy with his
decision to move to the University's
athletic department.
"I can't think of many jobs in the
world that I would pick up and leave
that great company and great brand
for, but this is one," Brandon said.
"I love the University of Michigan,
I loved it when I was here as a stu-
dent-athlete, I've been connected to
it ever since in one-way or another."
Brandon told reporters that he
would carry over his work ethic as
a CEO to the University's Athletic
Department.
"I'm not Don Canham, I'm notBo
Schembechler, I'm Dave Brandon,"
he said. "I'll bring my life experi-
ences to thisjob and I'll work harder
than any athletic director has ever
worked to be successful."
Brandon said it was too soon to
speculate on specific changes he
might make to the department, but
he said he would focus on unifying
and strengtheningthe department's
activities.
"Every business that I have led
has been number one in its category
or number one in the industry that it
competes in. I don't know any other
way," Brandonsaid. "I want the Ath-
letic Department at the University
of Michigan to be number one in the
nation in terms of talent, in terms of
accomplishment, in terms of success
in all the ways success can be mea-
sured. That's what I'll be working
towards."
However, Brandon also alluded
to his interest in furthering Mar-
tin's legacy for the Athletic Depart-
ment by continuing to renovate and
expand the University's athletic
facilities.
"There are big plans underway
to put the expansion in place and
the practice facilities," he said. "I've
seen a little bit about what those
plans are about, they look exciting.
They're long overdue."
Brandon specifically referenced
plans underway to make facility
improvements to Yost Ice Arena and
Crisler Arena, sayinghe was excited
about the opportunities.
"I'm aguywho understandswhat it
meansto be a Michigan man. I under-

stand the traditions of this place, I
understand the important role (the
Athletic Department)playsinthe Uni-
versity community and I think that
understanding and that grounding
that I have in this job will be an asset
in thisjob," Brandon told reporters.
Martin released a statement this
morning congratulating Brandon on .
being selected as his successor.
"I applaud Mary Sue Coleman for
making such an outstanding selec-
tion," Martin wrote in the state-
ment. "Dave has all the skills to run
Michigan Athletics. He's a former
Michigan athlete, an extremely suc-
cessful businessman, he served the
University as a regent so he under-
stands the internal workings and we
won't miss a beat."
Martin continued: "He'll certain-
ly move us forward. I'm very, very
pleased and I look forward to work-
ing with him in a very orderly and
smooth transition."
Associate Athletic Director Lloyd
Carr, formerly Michigan's football
coach, told the Daily in an interview
yesterday that he was excited about
Brandon's appointment.
"The University of Michigan Ath-
letic Director historicallyhas played
an important role not only in our
institution, but nationally as well,"
Carr said. "I think David brings a
breadth of experience in so many
different areas and that experience,
I think, is going to enable him to be a
great leader here."
Carr said he felt the decision
would be good not only for the ath-
letic department, but for the Univer-
sity as a whole.
"What comes across if you talk
to (Brandon) is great passion for the
University of Michigan," he said.
"He went to school here ... and was
a regent and he's done a lot of things
to improve the University so we're
all excited."
Michigan football coach Rich
Rodriguez echoed Martin's and
Carr's comments in a statement
released this morning.
"We are very excited that Dave
will be leading our athletic depart-
ment," Rodriguez wrote. "He has
been a successful leader in business
and I'm sure all of our teams will
benefit from his experience."
John Beilein, head coach of the
men's basketball program, also
released astatement this morning in
support of Brandon's selection.
"This is great news for the Uni-
versity of Michigan and our athletic
department," Beilein wrote. "There
was no question in my mind after
the interview process that David
Brandon is the right fit to lead our
program at thistime and in the years
to come."
Softball coach Carol Hutchins
agreed with Rodriguez.
"Clearly, DavidBrandon haslong-

standing ties to this University, and
he is an upstanding member of the
University community, the Ann
Arbor community and the state of
Michigan," Hutchins wrote in a
statement. "I am certain that Mary
Sue Coleman has found someone
committed to upholding the tradi-
tions of Michigan athletics."
In an interview this morning,
Regent Andrew Richner (R-Grosse
Pointe Park) praised Brandon's
selection.
"In my opinion, President Mary
Sue Coleman has chosen the perfect
person for the job," Richner said. "I
think Dave willbringinnovationand
new and fresh ideas to the depart-
ment. We're excited and thrilled to
have him joining our team."
Richner explained that he feels
Brandon's experience as a CEO and
his continued involvement with the
University makes Brandon the right
person for the job.
"A modern-day athletic depart-
ment is in fact a large and complex
organization, especially at a major
university like the University of
Michigan," Richner said. "As such,
the kind of skills to lead such an
organization are really those in line
with those of a CEO."
HesaidthoughMartinhasdone a
tremendous job while at the Univer-
sity, he believes Brandon willbe able
to not only carry on Martin's work,
but also expand on it.
"I think Bill Martin has done a
phenomenal job for us at the Univer-
sity with managing the construc-
tion projects and expansion of our
athletic campus. I can't think of a
better person tohave led the athletic
department during this period in
our history," Richner said. "We are
fortunate to have had Bill Martin
in that position and we're fortunate
to have a very able successor to Bill
Martin's legacy in Dave Brandon.
"I think he'll be able to build upon
a strong legacy at the University of
Michigan of having effective lead-
ership in our Athletic Department,"
Richner continued. "He brings adif-
ferent skill set in some ways and I
think we'll add to our tradition, we'll
build on our tradition."
Summing up Brandon's selection,
Richner said, "It is a good day for
Michigan."
Reflecting on his time as a
student-athlete at the University,
Brandon joked with reporters ear-
lier today about his time in the early
1970s as defensive end under leg-
endary Michigan football coach Bo
Schembechler.
"I tell people I got two degrees
from the University of Michigan,"
Brandon said. "The second one was
a degree from the Bo Schembechler
School of Leadership."
Brandonsaid he learned alot from
Schembechler by observing how he

recruited and managed talent.
"He recruited athletes not just
based on their skills or abilities on
the field, but he recruited charac-
ter and integrity," Brandon said. "I
learned that from him and I trans-
lated it into the way I recruited peo-
ple in my business career."
"He taught me about preparation.
He taught me about competing at
the highest level. He taught me what
intensity was all about," Brandon
continued. "All those qualities that
I learned being a part of the football
program at Michigan were qualities
that transferred very well to being a
leader in business and will transfer
well into being an athletic director."
Brandon was a member of three
Big Ten Championship football
teams and has remained active in
the University community since
graduating from the University in
1974 with a Bachelor of Arts degree
in communications. He served as a
University regent from 1998 - 2006
and is co-chair of the fundraising
campaign for the C.S. Mott Chil-
dren'sandVonVoigtlander Women's
Hospital construction project.
Brandonhas also receivedseveral
honors from organizations on cam-
pus - including the Distinguished
Alumni Service Award from the
University's Alumni Association in
2007, the Bennie Oosterbaan Award
from the Bob Ufer Quarterback
Club in 2008 and the CEO Coach of
the Year Award from the American
Football Coaches Association later
that same year.
Brandon also holds honorary doc-
toral degrees from Albion College,
Cleary College, Lawrence Techno-
logical University, Schoolcraft Col-
lege, Walsh College and Central
Michigan University - where he
served as a trustee from1994to 1998.
When thesearch for the next ath-
letic director was launched in Octo-
ber last year, Brandon was widely
rumored to be among the potential
successors. However, at the time,
Brandon would not confirm wheth-
erhe was interested inthe position.
"I am not campaigning for,
against, involved or uninvolved,"
Brandon told the Daily at the time.
"I'm doing what I do for a living and
that is, right now, running my Dom-
ino's Pizza corporation, and that's a
job that I love very much.'

and to move forward and to keep the

When Martin was named athletic
director in 2000, he was burdened
with large deficits, which he quickly
turned into sizable surpluses for the
Athletic Department.
"Bill Martin took over a program
that was in the red and in disarray,"
Newman said last night. "He not
only built the program where we've
been operating since not too long
after he took over, buthe also rebuilt
the athletic campus."
In addition to maintaing or
improving those finances, Brandon
faces a looming NCAA investiga-
tion into Michigan's football pro-
gram, inherits a Michigan football
program at one of the low points
of its history and has a responsi-
bility to finish Martin's vision for
further renovations to athletic
facilities - including Crisler and
Yost Arenas.
On a conference call with
reporters yesterday morning,
Brandon was asked about the
ongoing NCAA investigation
into the Michigan football pro-

gram. The NCAA is currently
investigating allegations that the
Michigan football team violated
NCAA restrictions on the time stu-
dent-athletes are allowed to spend
participating in football related
activities.
Brandon declined to comment,
saying he wasn't in a position to
make anystatements about it.
"I can't really comment, or
wouldn't comment if I could, on the
ongoing investigation," Brandon
told reporters.
"As it relates to the investigation,
we're going to do what Michigan
always does - we're goingto do the
right thing," Brandon said. "If we've
made some mistakes, we'll correct
them, but let's just wait and see how
the investigation pans out."
Though avoiding direct comment

on the NCAA investigation, Bran-
don did make a point to express his
support for Michigan football coach
Rich Rodriguez.
"Rich Rodriguez is the football
coach at the University of Michigan.
(He) has an awesome responsibil-
ity (and) has a proven track record
of winning at the highest levels,"
Brandon said. "I have great respect
for Rich and I look forward to get-
ting to know him better and getting
to work withhim."
Despite the demands he will face,
Newman said she is confident that
Brandon will be up to the challenge.
"I know he's excited about it and
I think we'll look back on this as
another one of President Coleman's
great hires," Newman said. "I feel
great confidence that the Athletic
Department isin the right hands."

MATT AARONSON
MANAGING EDITOR

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board. All other signed articles
and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.
Maintaining the legac
Daily's editorial page will uphold commitment to students
News media has been called the fourth branch of govern-
ment. National newspapers like The New York Times
cover national issues, serving as checks on the govern-
ment at the state and federal levels. As a locally-focused news-
paper, The Michigan Daily serves as a check on the University's
administration and the local government. And, as a paper run
entirely by students, it focuses on issues that impact its primary
readership: the University community. This editorial page will
continue to serve its readers by providing a varied, informed dis-
cussion of relevant issues that impact the lives of students.

The Daily has a rich history. In the 1960s,
an investigative reporter at the Daily won
acclaim for his work covering the Univer-
sity administration. In 1955, when Jonas
Salk created the first successful vaccine for
polio, the Daily broke the news. In recent
years, editorials have called for an office of
veteran's affairs and handicapped seating in
Michigan Stadium - and the University has
heard. All of these events have developed an
editorial page focused on one thing: serving
the students.
The Daily boasts 120 years of editorial
freedom in proud letters on the front page
in each and every edition. This is some-
thing that the staff of the Daily values at the
utmost level. Editorial freedom means that
the Daily is an autonomous entity. It is not
run by the University. The content within it
is decided upon, written and edited entirely
by students. The Daily's duty is to inform
students of the issues that affect them.
It is my responsibility as editorial page
editor to ensure that this page continues to
fulfill a dual purpose. First, it will provide
the student body with informed opinions
on issues that students should care about.
Second, it will facilitate debate with input
from all sides.
The editorials that will hereafter fill this
space will present students with opinions
based on fact and the Daily's values. Edito-
rials are unsigned because they aren't the
opinion of a single individual. These edito-
rials - considered, debated and formulated
by the Daily's editorial board - stand for the
ideals that the Daily has developed over the
course of 120 years. Editorials have unapol-
ogetically supported and will continue to

support social progressivism, environmen-
tal responsibility, community involvement
and advocacy for students' rights.
But this page is also a forum for discus-
sion. As college students, we should value
few things more than debate. For this part
of the paper to function properly, the Daily
needs its readers to speak up. Viewpoints
offer the chance for students and groups
to offer their opinions. Letters to the edi-
tor facilitate discussion between students.
These pieces come directly from students
and faculty, and the fresh ideas they bring
keep our page as diverse and informed as
the University's population. I encourage
you to write if you have something to say. I
promise I will consider your contributions
with the gravity they deserve.
As editorial page editor, I will make
certain that the widest possible variety of
opinions is represented on this page. This
page will not fail its historical significance.
It will not compromise its principles. And
it will continue to speak to the unique con-
cerns of its readers.
Rachel Van Gilder
Editorial Page Editor

erry Christmas, people of
Michigan. This is your par-
ents, the state government.
We've decided that
your New Year's
Resolution this
year will be to quit
smoking, and to "
that end, we pres-
ent your Christmas
present: astatewide
smoking ban in all
work places, minus
a few pesky exemp- ROBERT
tions, like cigar bars SOAVE
and smoking spe-
cialty shops. And,
oh yeah, Detroit's
three casinos. But all you smaller, more
vulnerable establishments, well, you
justhave to kick the habit.
Don't balk, dear readers, at this
patronizing tone. Now that the smok-
ing ban has Gov. Jennifer Granholm's
signature on it, the state has officially
taken on the role of the morality police.
And as lawmakers tread down the slip-
pery slope of regulating public health,
the biggest losers are private property
and individual rights.
After years of fighting over which
businesses to exempt, legislators
finally passed a statewide workplace
smoking ban that was signed into law
by Granholm on Dec. 18. In 4 press
release touting the bill's final approv-
al, the governor's office repeated the
misleading mantra of ban proponents,
claiming the ban "will make Michigan
the 38th state to ban smoking in public
places." But smoking is already prohib-
ited in most public places in Michigan.
And now it is private property owners
that, for the first time, will be required
to prohibit smoking.
This misconception stems from
state policymakers' gross misunder-
standing of the definitions of the words
"public" and "private." Their view, it
would seem, is that the private/public
designation depends upon the function
of the property, and if a building is open
to the public it is a public place. But
this is fundamentally flawed - private

property is private property no matter
what its owner uses it for or who is per-
mitted to enter.
In fact, a private place is simply
one that is owned by a private citizen,
whereas a public place is one that is
owned by some unit of government, be
it local, state or federal. The terms have
nothing to do with the number or type
of people that inhabit a certain space.
Nor does it matter what the space is
being used for. A restaurant or bar is
a private place in the same way that a
house is a private place. Police build=
ings, courthouses, state parks, etc., are
public places. Itis the ownership alone
that determines whether property is
public or private.
Because public property is govern-
ment owned, the state may prohibit
smoking in public places. Smoking
is already prohibited in most public
buildings - the University of Michigan
for example, banned smoking indoors
years ago, and in July 2011, will extend
the ban to include outdoor spaces as
well. This extension of the University's
ban is ill-advised for several reasons
- foremost, perhaps, that the Univer-
sity administration should not require
its students to make certain lifestyle
choices - but at least University prop-
erty is public space. The private prop-
erty of Michigan's restaurant and bar
owners, on the other hand, is not pub-
lic space, no matter how loudly (and
incorrectly) Granholm and state legis-
lators assert that it is.
Permitting the state government to
dictate whatsort of behavior is accept-
able on privately-owned property is
reckless and dangerous. Why not ban
smoking in people's homes as well?
It is not only in the workplace that
non-smokers encounter secondhand
smoke. While we're at it, why should
the smokers be allowed to suffer from
their bad habit? Certainly it follows
logically that if a healthier public is
the end goal, and the governmenthas a
right to intervene in individual behav-
ior in both privately-owned space
and publicly-owned space, smoking
should simply be banned completely

across the entire state.
And yet most people will recognize
that this would be too far for the gov-
ernment to go - that the government
has no right to compel healthy behav-
ior from its citizens. This is because
some people would rather engage in
an activity that they find pleasurable
(like smoking) even if it's bad for them.
But permitting the government to ban
smoking on private property is a bold
step inundermining both the right and
the ability of people to live their lives
the way they wantto.
The state shouldn't
dictate people's
private behavior.
While proponents of a ban cling
to numerous falsehoods, I'll touch
on just one more. It's absurd to claim
that restaurants and bars will benefit
economically from the enactment of
the smoking ban. If banning smoking
was beneficial for an establishment,
the establishment would prohibit
smoking on its own, as many bars
and restaurants across the state have
already done. But that's the owner's
call, not the government's. After all,
who understands the business better:
the owner whose life and livelihood
depend on it - who has likely spent
years improving it and is inextricably
linked to its success - or a bunch of
Lansing bureaucrats?
I say this every time I write a col-
umn against smoking bans, but I'll
say it again: I am not a smoker. I'm
not looking out for myself here. But an
important principal is at stake here.
With regard to private property and
personal behavior, lawmakers should
butt out.

The federal filibuster flunk

Investing in ethics

This country's political system has officially
become more dysfunctional than the Thanks-
giving dinners of many American families.
And while watching our leaders attempt to fix
this country's health care system isn't quite as
depressing as listening to NFL commentators
ask, "Why do they still allow the Lions to play on
Thanksgiving?" year after year, it's pretty close.
I'm holding out for the day Mitch McConnell
challenges Harry Reid to a duel with pistols at
dawn, televised on C-SPAN - no, ESPN - and
sponsored by Budweiser.
In fact, this could be an improvement. At least
we would have finally acknowledged that poli-
tics has become less about improving our nation
and more about winning partisan points. It's this
growing polarization of American politics that
has paralyzed policymaking. One of the most
controversial things about the current health
care bill is that it forces insurance companies to
actually provide health care to people who pay
for it. For the most part, this bill is an expansion
of a bloated, subpar patchwork of public and pri-
vate insurers and providers - a bill I half support
because of what it could accomplish, and half dis-
dain for what it could have done and didn't. Yet,
somehow this incremental effort at reform has
been transformed into the decisive battle in the
war against socialism, communism and fascism
all at the same time.
If it were up to me, political parties would be
banned outright and all levels of government
would be dissolved. In my utopian society, all dis-
putes would be settled via steel cage death match.
It would be quicker and more effective than the
dysfunctional, polarized system we're currently
forced to endure. Unfortunately, if Democrats
can barely pass the reforms on which they were
elected with a filibuster-proof majority, I don't
have much hope for Congress implementing my
model of governance.
Luckily, I have a Plan B: get rid of the filibus-
ter. I've come to the conclusion that this archaic
rule is one of the greatest contributing factors to
the crippling inertia of the legislative branch. At
first, I thought the filibuster was written into the
Constitution and thus nearly impossible to elimi-
nate. To my surprise, I found that there is abso-
lutely nothing stopping the abolishment of the
filibuster but the Senate itself, as it is an entirely

self-imposed limitation written into the Senate's
procedural rules. Each party criticizes the other
vehemently when it threatens to use the filibus-
ter but neither will dare dispose of it in case they
need it later.
The common supporting argument for the fili-
buster is that it allows the minority party to pre-
vent the majority party from being too radical in
its legislative pursuits. But in the modern era, the
only thing the filibuster accomplishes is putting
an enormous amount of influence in the hands of
a few senators that feign uncertainty over a bill.
Because a simple majority can't pass legislation
anymore, party leaders have to insert special
provisions and make concessions just to appease
wavering senators.
It wasn't always this way. In the 1950s, there
was an average of one filibuster per year. Accord-
ing to research by political scientist Barbara
Sinclair, threat or actual use of filibusters has
become a staple of the legislative process - grow-
ing from affecting only 8 percent of legislation in
the 1960s to 27 percent in the 1980s and finally
rising to 70 percent since the Democratic take-
over of 2006, when Republicans found them-
selves in the minority.
Hyperpartisanship has made it a political
imperative to oppose all action of the other party.
With the need for a supermajority to move a bill
through each step of the legislative process, the
filibuster ensures that the policies enacted by
Congress will be weak, watered down and full
of frivolous measures to appease senators in the
middle. The system in place is so constrained by
these two factors that the term "representative
democracy" threatens to lose its meaning. If we
can't vote representatives into office that will
enact the policies we want, can we really claim to
have a voice in how we are governed?
Instead of serving the public good, our rep-
resentatives are holding health care for ransom.
When the American people elect a party as a
majority, that majority has a mandate to take
the nation in the direction the people voted.for.
America deserves the change it voted for when
it gave control of both Congress and the White
House to the Democrats. America deserves
democracy that works.

Even before incoming freshmen
make their way to Ann Arbor
for the first time, chances
are they've heard
something about
the University's
colossal endow-
ment. At $6 billion,
even after the col-l-fh t
lapse of the stock
market, it's among
the ten biggest
endowments of
any American uni- MATTHEW
versity. In casual GREEN
competition with
friends at. other
schools, I always
enjoy mentioning that fact. Taking
on a somewhat Freudian tone, I occa-
sionally tease, "My endowment is big-
ger than yours," to which my friends
tend to supply some witty repartee.
But recently, one friend pointed
out that, although our endowment
might be huge, some of its compo-
nent investments are really nothing
to brag about. It was something I'd
heard before - the University is con-
stantly under some sort of criticism
about its investments. This time,
however, I felt ignorant about the
issues my friend raised and decided
to look into the matter.
Upon doing so, I was at once sur-
prisedby how extensively the Univer-
sity replied to a vast array of political
and ethical concerns on the webpage
for its Office of Public Affairs. One
could spend hours on that page just
reading about all the individual posi-
tions the University has taken on
social issues, in addition to assorted
policies regarding its investments.
A link entitled "Coca-Cola," for
instance, provides PDF files containing
correspondence between the Univer-
sity's chief financial officer and Coca-
Colaexecutives. Uponreadingthe files,
a remarkable narrative unfolds.
In the past few years, the Uni-

versity became concerned about
certain unethical practices at Coca-
Cola bottling plants in Colombia
and elsewhere. The University's
CFO petitioned Coca-Cola to permit
an investigation by an unaffiliated
organization to explore questionable
labor conditions. These efforts led
to, amongst other things, improved
collective bargaining rights for Coca-
Cola workers, contributing to what I
found to be a history of ethical invest-
ment choices made by the University.
That history started in 1978, when
the University chose to divest from
apartheid South Africa after the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents adopted
a resolution saying that an advisory
committee should be able to evalu-
ate an investment if a serious ethi-
cal issue arises. This clause was also
invoked in 1999, when then-Univer-
sity President Lee Bollinger led a
successful campaign to divest from
companies that profited from the
sale of tobacco. Both these instances
should remain points of pride for us.
Yet, there's always room for
improvement, particularly since the
University invests in hundreds of
companies each year. Take the case
of Nestle, in which the University
invested over $6 million in 2008. The
Swiss foods company has recently
come under fire for a variety of ethi-
cal issues ranging from child labor on
cocoa farms to price fixing to carry-
ing out business with dictatorships.
But what should matter even more
to the University is a little closer to
home.
In Stanwood, Michigan, a small
town near the center of the state, Nes-
tle planned to open a Perrier watei
bottling plant in 2001. Since then, the
plant has been the center of a contro-
versy regarding the environmental
damage caused by the plant's abuse
of a natural aquifer. Other than pro-
viding some employment - which
is admittedly vital in this state - the

plant hurts Michigan by pumping
500,000 gallons of water each day and
destroying established ecosystems.
To be sure, the University's finan-
cial officers probably invested in
Nestle for a variety of good reasons.
Nestle is, after all, among the world's
biggest foods companies. And espe-
cially now, as this state struggles to
keep (let alone create) jobs, Nestle
may appear to be a responsible choice
on account of its continued employ-
ment of Michiganders.
'U' should use its
endowment pull
for social good.

But if the University could per-
haps turn a blind eye to Nestle's other
unethical actions, it simply cannot
ignore the company's deleterious
effects on Michigan. Rather than
divest, the University ought to chan-
nel its recent history with Coca-Cola
and petition Nestle to make positive
changes to the way its Stanwood
plant affects the environment.
Despite what some may still think,
the University is not an insatiable
Gordon Gekko, intent solely on mak-
ing as much money as possible.
Indeed, it has shown remarkable
ethical care in recent history. But the
University cannot become compla-
cent just because it has done the right
thing in the past. It is the University's
responsibility to make every pos-
sible change for the better. And while
change is sometimes challenging, the
University can take a small baby step
in favor of social justice by reconsid-
ering its investment in Nestle.

"Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?" "No."
Th e inrn'antion of pi

With stunningly beautiful
visual effects and perfect use
of 3-D, Cameron's 'Avatar'
is more than just a movie
By Kavi Pandey Daily Film Editor
To slightly rephrase a quote from James
Cameron's new endeavor, "Avatar," "Well,
what'd you expect, numb-
nuts?"
Recall that Cameron, in all
of his bombastic arrogance, is Avatar
the preeminent visual story-
teller of our age, pioneering At Quality 16
new technological innova- and Showcase
tions in each of his films while 20th Century Fox
never sacrificing the narra-
tive quality. Since directing
"The Terminator" in 1984, Cameron has craft-
ed an unblemished directorial resume of iconic
blockbusters, from the thrill ride of "Aliens"
to the action extravaganza of "Terminator 2"
to the tear-inducing spectacle of "Titanic." So
with "Avatar," did you really expect anything
less than a colossal achievement?
Sure, it's made with cutting edge technology,
but "Avatar" has an old-school science-fiction
mass appeal that makes it endearingly great.
It's, one of those movies that everyone from
your Santa-believing niece to your agorapho-
bic grandparents will watch, love, then drag all

their friends with them to watch again.
"Avatar" roughly translates from Sanskrit
as the "reincarnation of a deity in a physical
form," and the title packs a wallop of a dou-
ble meaning. The film's narrative is driven by
this concept, with human minds controlling
genetically modified bodies of the Na'vi, the
indigenous population of the planet Pandora.
But the audience also has an avatar of its own
in the form of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington,
"Terminator Salvation"), a paraplegic ex-
marine. Through Sully and his Na'vi avatar,
we experience the heart-stopping wonder of
the alien planet, we share Sully's terror at its
abundant perils and, finally, we understand
the complex spiritual nature of Pandora and
its civilization.
Cameron's desire to create "Avatar" as an
immersive experience led to his creation of
brand-new cameras, revolutionizingthe imple-
mentation of 3-D in film. Gone is the gimmicky
use of this technology - the random pop-outs
from the screen used only for shock value. The
3-D effects are used in "Avatar" to dissolve the
invisible barrier between the audience and the
screen, pulling characters and environments
out of their typically flat dimensions.
Including the film's brilliant use of 3-D, the
list of what works in "Avatar" is endless. Let's
start off with the real star of the film: the planet
Pandora itself. From the stunning suspended-
in-air Hallelujah Mountains to the ethereal
Tree of Souls, the film has gorgeous visuals up
the wazoo. The effects that create the land-
scapes are so refined, they resemble an episode

of the Discovery Channel epic "Planet Earth"
more than computer-generated imagery.
Even the Na'vi, created through the gener-
ally reviled technology of motion-capture ani-
mation, look astonishingly'authentic. Through
new cameras, developed for "Avatar" alone,
Cameron magically makes the giant, blue aliens
appear as real as the humans opposing them.
Althoughthefilm's archetypal"Pocahontas"-
meets-"Dances with Wolves" story is quite pre-
dictable, it's told exceedingly well. It's a classic
tale of good versus evil, forbidden love and self-
discovery. It's an emotional roller-coaster that
will tear your heart through incredible trage-
dies, then later have you cheering in jubilation.
These emotional shifts are especially evident
during the climactic battle, a marvel of visual
artistry and action choreography. The action in
"Avatar" is never excessive or glorified, and it
keeps in line with the film's decidedly liberal-
leaning politics. The anti-corporatism, pro-
environment themes and parallels to the Iraq
War keep the film relevant, but the messages
are a bit too obtuse.
"Avatar" is more than a movie - it's a jaw-
dropping, heart-palpitating experience. It's
movies of this magnitude that redefine cin-
ema; new precedents have been established so
that motion-capture performances, 3-D and
visual effects as a whole will never be the same
again. After a 13-year absence since "Titanic"
shattered box-office records and rocked the
Oscars, James Cameron has returned with
"Avatar" to reclaim his throne as the king of
the world.

So much for going to the mov-
ies to escape. "Up in the Air" is a
film that lives and breathes in the
now, placing
the palm of its *
hand on mid-
dle America's Up in theAir
tender, throb-
bing heart. Its At the Michigan,
very existence Quality16and
is proof that Showcase
Hollywood Paramount
has not yet lost
touch with the
moviegoers who fuel its booming
industry. This movie makes us
believe George Clooney's profes-
sional downsizer actually exists
in the same world as the real-
life, recently laid-off people who
appear in interspersed footage.
What "Up in the Air" actually
says about how we live our lives
in the 21st century - and whether
today's jobless masses care what
million-dollar names Clooney and
director Jason Reitman ("Juno")
think about them - is up for debate.
But inmany ways,that's the mark of
a truly excellent movie: It inspires
those kindsofdebates. Itmakesyou
envision yourself, your family and
your closest friends up there on the
mile-high screen, and it makes you
stop and wonder: Where do we go
from here?
In Clooney's case, his desti-
nation is right there in the title.
He plays Ryan Bingham, a seem-
ingly self-sufficient man whose
job is to fly around the country
laying off people he has never
met, from companies for which
he has never worked. It's a cold
line of work, but refreshingly,
Bingham isn't a cold guy. He's
genuinely charming and person-
able in that George Clooney way,
and he cares about the employ-
ees he's firing, too - at least as
much as his job will allow. When
a young upstart named Natalie
(Anna Kendrick, "New Moon")
tries to push a layoffs-through-
teleconferencing system to save
their corporation in travel costs,
Bingham fights to maintain what
he sees as the integrity of the
face-to-face conversation, which,
while still heartless, is at least
heartless in a heartfelt way.
Bingham also enters a flirty,
tentative relationship with Alex
(Vera Farmiga, "Orphan"), a fel-
low frequent flyer who seems
just as casually adrift as he is.

They share a kinship, though as
Bingham makes clear in his busi-
ness conference talks, he doesn't
believe in marriage, families or the
concept of "settling down." About
the only thing he's driven to do is
earn the magic 10-million miles
on his American Airlines card and
the perks that come with it. Why?
Well, because he's close to 'the
total, and everyone needs some-
thing to shoot for.
As Bingham and Natalie float
like ghosts through terminals
and Hilton hotels, they wonder to
each other and themselves what
the point of it all is. They sever
the lifelines of employees who
have put everything into an ideal-
ized notion of the Great American
Dream that no longer exists.
In brief cameos, J.K. Simmons
("Extract") and Zach Galifianakis
("The Hangover") may have the
most important roles in the film.
They're the embodiment of the
people whose stories nevergettold
in Hollywood. After all, there's
nothing fancy or elegant about
losing your job while trying to
provide for a family with no fore-
seeable options in the future.
In its own serio-comic way, "Up
in the Air" might be one.of the
most depressing movies to come
along in a while. There are scenes
filmed in Detroit that will hit a
little too close to home for many
local viewers. But that's the point:
The movie is close to home. It asks
what the ideas of home and secu-
rity mean to different people today
A sobering look
at American life.
- a theme especially resonant
when Bingham attends his sister's
weddinglate in the film.
Throughout, with rarely an
emotional misstep, director Reit-
man throws away the razor wit
and cynicism that acted as smoke-
screens in his first feature films
"Thank You for Smoking" and
"Juno." Instead, he grants "Up in
theAir" avulnerabilitythat allows
it to function as a time capsule of
our current economic and ideo-
logical crossroads. Watching the
movie as a blissfully-uncertain-
about-the-future college student is
a bittersweet reminder that, soon-
er or later, everyone has to come
downfrom the clouds.

Daily Arts Writer
Hiawatha Bailey calls the '60s in
Ann Arbor "a rare moment in space
and time when everything just
. came together."
Bailey was a member of the
White Panthers, an Ann Arbor-
based group that worked with the
Black Panthers for equal rights
for African-Americans, during
those years. It's stories like his
- stories about hanging out with
John Lennon and protesting on
South University Avenue - that
have inspired Alan Glenn's docu-
mentary film "Ann Arbor in the
60s." The film, which is "still in
the research stage," has evolved
greatly since its inception.
"Originally, it was just going to
be a film about interesting people
in Ann Arbor," Glenn said, "kind of
like an Errol Flynn kind of film."
But now the film has become
an exposition of the '60s as an
era in Ann Arbor. Glenn had been
writing a series of articles for The
Ann Arbor Chronicle spotlighting
members of the community who
were active and influential during
the '60s. The articles converged
into his new vision for "Ann Arbor
in the 60s," because the characters
he was interviewing were good
candidates for a more historically
based documentary.
"The hippie-type person that I
was learning about became what
the film was devoted to, because
they seemed to me, the most inter-

esting ones," he said. of the freedom inherent to the col-

Bailey sees these events as proof feature in "Ann Arbor in the 60s" is

how the town served as a cultural
Mecca during those times, inspir-
ing new sounds and artists.
"I talked to Mike Luntz (of
Brownsville Station) and he said
that there are cities that pop up
every so often that just act as a place
for talents to converge," Glenn said.
"It was Seattle in the '90s, Minne-
apolis in the '80s, and it was Ann
Arbor in the '60s."
It's this cultural movement and
the talent it attracted that Glenn
hopes will make "Ann Arbor in the
60s" a success.
"It has celebrities: Bob Seger,
Iggy Pop, Tom Hayden, Bill Ayers,
Gilda Radner, Christine Lahti,
John Lennon, Paul McCartney. It
has excitement - sex, drugs, and
rock'n'roll. It has plenty of sensa-
tionalism," Glenn said.
Like many small-time filmmak-
ers, Glenn is struggling to fund his
endeavor. He said he has received a
few small grants so far but is look-
ing for people who are willing to
invest and are just as passionate
about the subject matter.
While Ann Arbor may no lon-
ger be overrun with hippies draw-
ing chalk pictures on the sidewalk,
Glenn feels the subject matter of
the film is still relevant.
"The '60s are still a popular
topic, and they're still very much
with us," Glenn said, "Witness the
Bill Ayers flap during the last elec-
tion. The '60shave been in the air of
late - 40th anniversaries and such
- and so this seems like a perfect
time for a film like this."

Monday, December 14, 2009 =- 7A

CHERRY
From Page 1A
gan Daily in an interview yesterday
Cherry's decision not to run will
"make (the race) wide open."
Other candidates vying for the
Democratic nomination include
state Rep. Alma Wheeler Smith
(D-Salem), former state Rep. John
Freeman (D-Madison Heights) and
George Perles, a MSU trustee. Oth-
ers like Dillon and Lansing Mayor
Virg Bernero have expressed inter-
est in competing for the guberna-
torial seat, but have not formally
entered the race.
In a statement released yesterday
Dillon didn't include how Cherry's
decision will affect his own cam-
paign, but he wrote that he appre-
ciates the work Cherry has done in
office.
"Michigan residents owe John
Cherry a debt of gratitude for his
decades of dedicated public ser-
vice," Dillon wrote in the release. "I
respect John's decision and the tre-
mendous work he has done for the
state of Michigan."
Though Cherry had been the
Democratic front-runner, polls
show he still lagged behind Repub-
lican candidates Attorney Gen-
eral Mike Cox, Congressman Pete
Hoekstra (R-Mich.) and Oakland
County Sheriff Michael Bouchard
who hold the top three spots,
respectively, according to data
released by The Detroit News in a
Nov. 30, 2009 article.

Stu Sandler, the campaign man-
ager for Cox, said though Cherry
was a "very strong competitor," his
decision to decline running for the
gubernatorial bid is not going to
affect Cox's campaign.
"I think Mike's in a very strong
position," Sandler said in an inter-
view with the Daily today. "He has
a plan to bring jobs back to Michi-
gan. I don't think it matters who's
running in either primary. He's
running a very strong race."
Sandier also said Cox's fund-
raising efforts have been success-
ful thus far, despite the challenge
the recession presented in raising
money.
"I think it's a tough environment
to fundraise, but I think people
are going to be impressed by the
amount of support Mike has got,"
he said.
Many believe the outlook for the
Democratic Party is bleak for this
election year, given the unpopular-
ity of the current state administra-
tion. In a statement released by
Bouchard, he wrote Cherry's deci-
sionto not run for governor is related
to his association with Michigan's
current political problems.
"I think anyone who has been
in Lansing for the last eight years
has a difficult time campaigning
on fixing the mess they were part
of creating," Bouchard wrote in the
release. "I think Lieutenant Gov-
ernor Cherry was faced with this
reality."
John Truscott, the spokesman
for Hoekstra's campaign, said

Cherry's decision to not run in the
race will turn the election in favor
of the Republican Party, though he
said he predicts that the race will
get closer toward the end.
"I think people want change,"
Truscott said. "I think people are
looking for a different course, and
frankly, a lot of people in Michi-
gan are looking for.jobs and look-
ing for the people that can provide
answers. The feeling is starting
to move toward the Republican
Party."
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm, who has worked with Cher-
ry in the gubernatorial office since
2003, expressed regret regarding
Cherry's decision to end his cam-
paign possibilities for the guberna-
torial race.
Granholm wrote in a press
release yesterday that she appreci-
ates everything Cherry has done in
serving Michigan throughout his
political career. She cited his work
helping to diversify Michigan's
economy and increasing prospects
for higher education for Michigan
citizens.
"I am proud of John Cherry's
work in our administration and the
integrity he demonstrated in con-
sideringagubernatorialcampaign,"
Granholm wrote in the release.
"I look forward to his continued
counsel and support throughout
the remainder of this year as we
work to move Michigan forward."

contributed to this report.

Through Daily and legal career,
McQuade has sought the truth

From Page 1A
1986. She was the second woman
to hold the position.
McQuade said she loved the
respect she received from coaches
Schembechler, Berenson and Frie-
der, who she said always patiently
answered her questions and knew
her name.
"Although I liked to think they
remembered my name because of
my work, I think it is more likely
that they remembered my name
because there were so few female
reporters then," McQuade said.
Continuing to set new prec-
edents, McQuade said she is ready
to be the first female to lead the
U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit.
She cited women like Wayne
County Prosecutor Kym Worthy
and Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm, a former Michigan attor-
ney general, who McQuade said
-are two women who have "served
with great distinction" and paved
the way for her career.
"I have really ridden their coat-
tails to some extent, and I think
that it's no longer a novelty (to be
a female with a high position),"
McQuade said. "People have an
expectation that women can serve
as effective prosecutors."
McQuade said one of her goals
in her new position is to prevent
violent crimes in Michigan by hav-
ing her office take on an increased
role in enforcement.
With the state's budget in crisis,
McQuade said county prosecutors
are working with limited resourc-
es and are having trouble "keeping
up with the workload." To help
alleviate the pressure, McQuade
wants her office to step in and
address issues like the high rates
of carjacking, armed robbery and
firearm cases.
"I think that violent crime is
what really affects people's lives
and the quality of life in our state,"
she said. "If we can make a dent
in violent crime, we can really
improve people's lives."
Since 1998, she has served as
deputy chief of the U.S. Attor-
ney's Office National Security
Unit, where she has advised law
enforcement on security issues
concerning major events in the
Metro Detroit area.
McQuade worked at sporting
events like the 2004 Ryder Cup
at Oakland Hills, the 2005 Major

League Baseball All-Star Game at
Comerica Park, Super Bowl XL in
2006 and the 2009 NCAA Final
Four at Ford Field.
McQuade's interest in gov-
ernment can be traced back to
her days as a Daily reporter, she
said. During that time, her favor-
ite book was "All the President's
Men" - a story about two jour-
nalists who investigated Presi-
dent Richard Nixon's Watergate
scandal.
"What reporters and prosecu-
tors do is very similar - looking
for wrongdoing and looking for
misconduct and trying to expose
that," she said. "I think that influ-
ence certainly inspired me to do
what I do today."
University alum and Student
Publications board member Phil
Nussel traveled with McQuade on
road trips, covering the Michigan
football team during their four
years working together in the
Daily's sports section during the
mid-1980s.
Nussel, who is now managing
editor of Automotive News Online,
distinctly recalled one trip to the
1987 Rose Bowl, when Michigan
lost to Arizona State 22-15. Despite
the loss, McQuade said govering
the Rose Bowl was the highlight of
her journalism career.
Their junior year, Nussel and
McQuade ran against each other
for the position of managing
sports editor. In a close election,
McQuade won by two votes. Now,
24 years later, Nussel joked about
how he lost by a slim margin but
said McQuade was perfect for the
job.
"She won by a couple votes,
and she deserved it," Nussel said.
"She was an outstanding journal-
ist, and I really thought she had a
career in journalism ahead of her.
I didn't think she'd go into law, but
she turned out to be a hell of a law-
yer."
University alum Eric Matt-
son was the editor-in-chief while
McQuade was sports editor. In an
interview last week, Mattson said
it was impressive for a woman to
be managing sports editor and
lead the sports section of a news-
paper in those days.
He added that he loved working
with McQuade because he could
always count on her to get a job
done.
"I have to say that Barb was the

most consistent, reliable, sharp
editor that you could hope to deal
with," Mattson said. "She ran a
tight ship, but at the same time,
you could tell that she and her
writers were having a really good
time."
When Mattson heard McQuade
received the U.S. attorney posi-
tion, he said he was not the least
bit surprised by the announce-
ment.
"If you would have told me 20
years ago thatshe would have been
U.S. attorney someday, that would
not have surprised me," he said.
"And frankly it would not surprise
me if she continues to move up the
ladder."
Joe Ewing, a University and
Daily alum, worked with McQuade
in the sports section for three
years. He said he remembered her
having a great sense of humor and
getting along with everyone.
"She took everything in stride
- especially in a sports depart-
ment where it seemed to be more
male-dominated - but she never
seemed to be intimidated by any-
body," Ewing said.
Nussel said McQuade has
superb leadership skills that will
get her through difficult moments
over the next few years.
"The thing about Barb McQuade
is that nothing ever fazes her," he
said. "She's a cool customer. That's
the kind of mentality you need
when you're the most important
law enforcement official in south-
east Michigan. You have to really
be able to keep your cool and she
does that."
Nussel said that he's most
impressed that McQuade has
time to raise her four kids, ages 6
through 12.
"To be as successful as she is
and to still have time to raise a
family is pretty amazing stuff," he
said.
McQuade met her husband
Dan Hurley while they attended
Law School at the University. As
an assistant U.S. attorney, Hurley
works with McQuade at the attor-
ney's office.
McQuade said she's lucky to
have her husband for support but
is confident she'll be able to bal-
ance her job and family.
The McQuades currently live in
Ann Arbor and remain dedicated
Michigan sports fans, McQuade
said.

Cuban officials protest increased
screening for U.S.-bound flights

Top diplomat calls
the controls
"discriminatory and
selective"
HAVANA (AP) - Cuba sum-
moned the top U.S. diplomat on the
island yesterday to protest extra
screening for Cuban citizens fly-
ing into the United States, calling
the rule a "hostile action" meant to
justify America's trade embargo.
The new dispute comes after
several setbacks that have all but
snuffed out hope for a quick resolu-
tion to the half-century of antago-
nism between Cuba and the United
States, and as Cuban officials have

been increasingly sharp-spoken
about their disappointment in
President Barack Obama.
Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, director
of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's
North American affairs office, said
the new security controls were
"discriminatory and selective."
"We categorically reject this
new hostile action by the govern-
ment of the United States against
Cuba," she told The Associated
Press in an exclusive interview.
Vidal Ferreiro said she lodged
the protest in an afternoon meet-
ing with Jonathan Farrar, the head
of the U.S. Interests Section, which
Washington maintains in Cuba
instead of an embassy. Cubit's top
diplomat in Washington delivered
a similar message to State Depart-

ment officials earlier in the day,
she said.
The United States imposed the
airline security measures Monday
following an apparent attempt by
a Nigerian man to blow up a pas-
senger jet as it approached Detroit
on Christmas Day.Among the 14
nations whose citizens will face
increased scrutiny are four -
Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria - that
the U.S. government considers
state sponsors of terrorism.
Cuba has been on that list since
the 1980s, but has always main-
tained its inclusion had more to
do with the United States' antag-
onistic policy toward the com-
munist-governed nation than
with evidence that it sponsors
terrorism.

Blue still has
a mountain to
climb in Big Ten

For those of you who
were home, vacation-
ing or working over
winter break, let me fill you in
on one rather important bit of
news: The
Michigan
basketball
team beat
a ranked
opponent.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Breaaaathe.-
It actu- NICOLE
ally hap- AUERBACH
pened.
The Wol-
verines beat.
Ohio State, who was ranked No.
15 in the nation, last Sunday at
Crisler Arena. (I promise.)
After loss upon loss to talent-
ed - as well as, frankly, medio-
cre - teams, let's just say fans
weren't expecting a big win
from the Wolverines. Yet here
we are, mere days into the new
year, and finally, Michigan has
the closest thing to a signature
win it can muster.
But before we all jump back
onto the NCAA Tournament
bandwagon, let's consider what
this win actually means.
First of all, it is a big win, it
is a big deal. The Wolverines
looked the best they have all
season hands down.
Michigan retained focus for
nearly the entire game - for the

first time all season.
Junior guard Manny Harris
and senior forward DeShawn
Sims were electric, combining
for 52 of Michigan's 73 points
(on just 34 shots, too). Even the
role players, like sophomore Stu
Douglass and freshmen Darius
Morris and Matt Vogrich, all
stepped up to complement the
two-star show.
That's the good news, and it's
about time there's good news to
discuss.
But here's the reality check:
Michigan still has a huge hill to
climb after its terrible start to
the season.
Actually, it's more than a hill.
Let's call ita mountain.
The Wolverines went 0-5
against the teams you've heard
of - ranging from run-of-the-
mill Boston College to top-
notch Kansas - and they blew
every chance they had to pick
up a quality and/or signature
win before the Big Ten season.
Now, the only nonconference
shot at a resume-building win is
No. 13 Connecticut. One victory
like that doesn't always cut it,
either. Oh, and UConn is good.
That brings us to Big Ten
season.
Let's start with Sunday's win
over No. 15 Ohio State. I know
the ranking was right there
next to the Buckeyes' name, but
it certainly didn't feel like a true

Michigan tops No.15
Ohio State for first
quality win of season

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
Before its 73-64 win over
Ohio State on Sunday, the Wol-
verines' winter break had given
them very little to relax about.
The Wolverines kicked off
the break with a heartbreaking
loss in Lawrence against top-
ranked Kansas, thanks mostly
to incredibly poor shooting -18
percent from beyond the 3-point
line. -
The team came back to Cris-
lIr for a brief reprieve against
Coppin State. And while the
Golden Lions didn't exactly sky-
rocket Michigan's RPI, sopho-
more Stu Douglass got back on
track, shooting 60 percent from
downtown and finishing with
20 points.
Then the Big Ten season
started, with what seemed like
an exceedingly winnable game

against an Indianateamthatwas
without its leading scorer, Mau-
rice Creek. And the Wolverines
probably could have pulled it
out, had they not forgotten their
two superstars inAnn Arbor.
Junior Manny Harris and
senior DeShawn Sims had very
pedestrian 13- and 12-point
games, respectively.
Yes, Michigan was heading
into its first conference home
game, against the Buckeyes, in a
bit of a funk. But from the very
beginning of the game, some-
thing seemed different.
Ohio State scored on their
first possession after winning
the jump, but Harris came right
back down the court and sank a
contested 3-pointer to answer
immediately.
And while that was just the
first two possessions of the
game, it set the tone for the rest

M' shows promise in
close road loss to Big
Ten-leading Ohio State

Conference play
0 proves to be a
struggle early for
young Wolverines
By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
While improvement can't nec-
essarily be measured by defeat,
the Michigan women's basketball
team showed promise in its close
59-56 loss to No. 6 Ohio State in
Columbus on Sunday.
The three-point loss was Mich-
igan's narrowest margin against
its rival since it beat the Buckeyes
in 2001, also on Ohio State's home
court. Michigan played neck-and-
neck with the Big Ten conference
O leaders for 40 minutes before
sophomore guard Courtney Boy-
lan missed a wide-open 3-pointer

with seconds left.
"It wasn't like we threw it
away," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said afterwards. "We
had opportunities. We just didn't
make baskets and they did. Court-
ney almost hit the last shot. She
was on track but she missed it."
Michigan (1-3 Big Ten, 9-5
overall) jumped out to a quick.
8-0 run in the first two minutes
at Value City Arena. And even
after the Buckeyes came back, the
two teams were separated by no
more than a single field goal until
the final four minutes when Ohio
State pulled ahead for the win.
Those final minutes clinched the
Buckeyes' 13th-straight victory
against the Wolverines.
But a reenergized Michigan
squad was almost enough to end
that streak.
The Wolverines entered the
game with back-to-back confer-
ence losses against Michigan

Big Ten had its
coming-out party
this bowl season

'm sure I'm not the only
one around Ann Arbor who
felt, well, empty during this
holiday season, watching teams
like East Carolina, Middle Ten-
nessee State and Idaho (Seriously,
Idaho?) play in fluffy bowl games
while Michi-
gan couldn't
even muster
a spot in the
Little Caesar's
Pizza, Pizza
Bowl.
Without a
direct vested
interest for the ANDY
second con- REID
secutive bowl
season (rooting
against The Vest doesn't count),
the games felta little stale, boring
and unnecessary. Don't get me
wrong, I watched almost every
one, but you know what I mean.
I didn't even have much hope
for the whole "rooting for the
Big Ten" route, as the conference
gave me almost no hope of remote
competitiveness after finishing
1-6 in postseason play last year, a
record so bad you'd almost think
the Big Ten was intentionally try-
ing to embarrass itself.
But then Wisconsin dominated
Miami (Fla.) in a game that was
much more lopsided than its
20-14 score would lead you to
believe. Then, Northwestern nar-
rowly fell to Auburn in overtime
in the Outback Bowl, despite five
ridiculous interceptions from
quarterback Mike Kafka, includ-
ing two at the goal line, and a
kicker who seemingly did not
understand the ultimate goal of
placekicking.
The Outback Bowl's sideline
reporter said Northwestern coach
Pat Fitzgerald told his team in the
fourth quarter that "We're still in
this, even though we're playing
with 10 men on offense - our QB
is playing for the other team!" and
the Wildcats still almost pulled
it out.
Then, Penn State beat LSU in
the trenches. And That Team
Which Shall Remain Nameless
claimed the conference's first
Rose Bowl Championship since
the 1999-2000 season. (A fact
which still boggles my mind, see-
ing as how the Big Ten helped
create the "Grand Daddy Of Them
All").

And Iowa won the Orange
Bowl 24-14 last night. Georgia
Tech's spread-triple-option-type
offense is incredibly hard to scout
against (just ask Clemson), and
the Hawkeyes should get major,
major props for its pregame
preparation.
Wait - the lowly Big Ten play-
ing well in the BCS - the same
conference which hadn't won on
the nation's big stage since the
2004-05 season? Wow.
But the most impressive per-
formance may have been in a los-
ing effort - Michigan State and
its Big Ten-worst pass defense
(sans starting cornerback Chris
L. Rucker and a slew of frat-boy-
pounding players after being sus-
pended for an on-campus brawl)
lost a heartbreaker to pass-happy
Texas Tech, a game which I had
written off as an inevitable blow-
out, with or without coach Mike
Leach.
All told, the conference fin-
ished 4-3 in bowls, with a terrific
showing in the Bowl Champion-
ship Series. It doesn't sound all
that spectacular, but it's some-
what of a remarkable turnaround
from a near-disastrous output 12
months ago.
The Big Ten finally - after
what seems like a football eter-
nity - has taken back some of the
credibility it lost when Southern
Cal decided to make idiots out
of any Midwesterner who dared
travel to Pasadena in January
during a depressing eight-year
span. And a wholly unexpected
2-0 mark in the BCS should cer-
tainly turn the nation's collective
head toward the Great Lakes.
I don't think anyone saw this
kind of collective performance
coming (especially ESPN colum-
nist Pat Forde, who predicted
a second straight 1-6 record for
the Big Ten). So it was a pleasant
surprise for Big Ten fans - and it
should be, even for the fans of the
four teams that missed out on the
postseason this time around.
I don't know if this will have
any long-lasting effects, but it's
gotta feel nice for Big Ten com-
missioner Jim Delany and the rest
of the conference to stifle the rest
of the nation - at least for one
offseason.

benched against RPI, backstopped year.

"We had the puck under control
for much of the power play and
moved it pretty well." Berenson
said. "We got some good scor-
ing opportunities, but it's still an
issue."
Michigan went just one-for-
eight with the man advantage
against RPI, but against the Hus-
kies, the Wolverines scored a sea-
son-high three power play goals.
And if the Wolverines expect to
make a second-half run at a top-
four spot in the CCHA, they'll
need their power play to be click-
ing on all cylinders - something it
has rarely done this year.
The disappointment hung heav-
ily from Tuesday's loss.
"It's tough waking up on
(Wednesday) morning and know-
ing you're playing in the consola-
tion game for third place," Rust
said. "But we're trying to get a bid
into the NCAA Tournament."
"It's not good obviously to lose
(against RPI)," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said. "We came here
to get in the Championship game,
number one, and to try and get our
name up on that banner, again.

That's why everyone comes here.
But we had something to prove,
and we didn't quite prove it."
Missed scoring opportunities
seemed tobe commonplace for the
Wolverines against the Engineers
as Michigan pelted RPI goaltender
Allen York with 46 shots. Unfor-
tunately for Michigan, just three
found their way into the back of
the net.
According to junior forward
Carl Hagelin, though, it was the
defensive side of the redline that
cost the Wolverines (10-10 overall,
5-7 CCHA) a chance at a rematch
with intrastate rival Michigan
State in the championship game.
"It all comes down to how many
goals you let up," he said. "Every-
one is so defensive-minded. If
you don't take care of your own
end, you're not going to win any
games."
Between netminders Bryan
Hogan and Shawn Hunwick -who
replaced Hogan after the second
period - they surrendered four
goals on 13 shots, a statistical line
that warrants some concern from
behind the Wolverine bench.


AUERBACH
From page 1B
No. 15 team playing out there.
Without junior sensation Evan
Turner (back injury), Ohio State
isn't a top-25 squad. He's not gone
for the season, so the Buckeyes
will soon be a viable threat again
- but for now, Ohio State isn't
that good. Want proof? Just look
at its 22-point loss to Wisconsin
three days before it played Michi-
gan.
And though it might cheer
Wolverine fans to see the Buck-
eyes' 0-2 start in conference play,
Michigan's 1-1 mark raises plenty
of concerns of its own.
The Wolverines played down
to Indiana's level on Dec. 31, and
then let the Hoosiers run away
with the game down the stretch.
The same thing happened with
Utah, and even Boston College.
BUCKEYES
From page 1B
of the afternoon. Michigan had an
answer for everything Ohio State
threw at it, and for each answer, the
Wolverines threw a little something
of their own.
In the first half, the two teams
played each other to a tee, finish-
ing with nearly identical statistics
- both teams shot about 50 percent
from the field and about 40 percent
from beyond the arc. Michigan had
14 rebounds, Ohio State 15. They
even both attempted just three free
throws.
"Our defense today, holdingthem
to those percentages," Michigan
coach John Beilein said. "Just doing
a better job on (Ohio State junior)
David (Lighty) was huge. They've

I promise you, Michigan's roster
boasts more talent than those
three teams. But the Wolverines
weren't playing their best - they
played slightly below their oppo-
nents' best. Michigan fans can
call these games whatever they
want, but here's how the NCAA
Tournament committee will
see them: bad loss, bad loss and
(drumroll, please ...) bad loss.
Michigan showed flashes of
brilliance against the nation's
best team, Kansas, and the Wol-
verines played their best game
of the season against the 15th-
ranked Buckeyes. Again, these
games weren't flukes. Michigan
simply played up to its competi-
tion's level.
This rollercoaster play - on
obvious display in the Wolver-
ines' first two Big Ten games -
should be a concern heading into
the rest of the conference season.
The Big Ten isn't nearly as
got some very innovative ways of
gettingthem jumpshots."
And after halftime, Harris and
Sims made their superstar statuses
clear to the Buckeyes.
Michigan'stwobest players came
alive in the second half, combining
for 31 points while shooting 13-17
from the floor. Their second half
performance allowed Michigan to
hold off Ohio State for the win.
"I was just comfortable out
there," Harris said. "I was trying to
make plays, and let everythingcome
to me."
Throughout this season, Michi-
gan has failed to score or get a stop
in nearly every critical moment. On
Sunday, the team came through.
There was freshman Darius
Morris's beautiful fadeaway jumper
in the lane to put the Wolverines up
eight midway through the second

good as we all thought heading
into the season. But it's not a
cakewalk. For Michigan, games
on the road against Purdue and
Michigan State are looming.
Northwestern is playing better
than everyone expected. And
Turner will be back soon for Ohio
State.
I'm not trying to belittle Michi-
gan's win on Sunday, I'm really
not. But people must be wary of
placing higher expectations on a
team that floundered under that
kind of burden earlier this season.
Sunday's win may prove to be
the first step up the mountain,
a trip that next goes through
a Happy Valley, and could still
potentially end with a summit
stop at March Madness.
But let's not get too ahead of
ourselves just yet.

half.
And then there was the energy
freshman Matt Vogrich brought
off the bench, getting two putbacks
in the paint and electrifying the
Crisler crowd with an uncharacter-
istic block from behind.
This season, Michigan has played
beneath their expectations. The
problem hasgonebeyond poor shoot-
ing, beyond poor defense - it is just
bad chemistry. And while a win at
home against an Evan Turner-less
Ohio State is not a season-changing
event, itis a step inthe right direction.
"Anytime you beat Ohio State
at Michigan, especially after last
year when (former Ohio State
center B.J.) Mullens saying they
were going to beat us four years
in a row," Novak said. "That's not
going to happen. It just feels good
getting that win, it was fun."

INSIGHT BOWL
Iowa State 14, Minnesota 13
VS
You knew it was over when: Minnesota freshman
quarterback MarQueis Gray - with just over four min-
utes left in the fourth quarter - fumbled the ball on a
quarterback draw to seal the Cyclones' first winning
season since 2005. The victory gave Iowa State seven
wins, a drastic turnaround from its abysmal two-win
season last year in which it beat South Dakota State and
Kent State.
-Mark Burns

OUTBACK BOWL
Auburn 38, Northwestern 35
VS
You knew it was over when: Auburn recovered a
fumble by Northwestern quarterback Mike Kafka in
the first overtime and the Tigers rushed the field. But
wait ... an official review showed that he was down.
The game was over again when Northwestern kick-
er Stefan Demos missed a field goal that would have
extended the game, and Auburn stormed the field a
second time. But wait ... the Tigers were penalized for
roughing the kicker. Arguably the craziest bowl of the
season finally ended after four hours when Northwest-
ern's bizarre fake field goal fumblerooskie was stopped
to seal a 38-35 Auburn win.

CAPITAL ONE BOWL
Penn State 19, LSU 17
VS
MVP: Penn State quarterback Daryll Clark. The
senior Nittany Lion had fire in his eyes as he took the
soaking wet field in Orlando on New Years Day. Penn
State was incontrolthe entire game, even as LSU found
its offensive stride in the second half. Despite terrible
field conditions, Clark completed 18 of 35 passes for 216
yards in the final game of his collegiate career. And he
led the Nittany Lions down field late in the 4th quarter
to set up the game-winning field goal.
-Casandra Pagni

VALERO ALAMO BOWL
Texas Tech 41, Michigan State 31
SVS
I didn't change the channel because: The game
remained tight until the fourth quarter, with Michi-
gan State leading by just one point. Then, Texas Tech
junior quarterback Taylor Potts was knocked out of
the game with an injury to his non-throwing hand.
And the turning point of the game came when junior
quarterback Steven Sheffield replaced Potts. Sheffield
completed nine of 11 passing attempts and led the Red
Raiders on two more scoring drives, allowing them to
steal the lead from the Spartans.
-Brittany Shannon

-Andrew Haddad

HOLIDAY BOWL:
NEBRASKA 33, ARIZONA O
Youknewit was overwhen: The game started. The
Cornhuskers' defensive line, led by Ndamukong Suh,
assaulted Arizona all night, leading to a 33-0 thrashing,
the first shutout in Holiday Bowl history. And in fact,
the scariest part of the game wasn't watching the Corn-
huskers' monster defensive line, it was the halftime
fireworks that made the stadium shake to its core.
-Alex Prosperi
LAS VEGAS BOWL:
BYU 44, OREGON STATE 20
MVP: The wind. With gusts of up to 50 miles per
hour, kicking into the wind was tough in the early part
of the game for the Beavers. One Oregon State punt
went just six yards. BYU never lost its advantage, even
when the teams changed direction. The wind was so
bad that ESPN's skycam became a safety hazard, offi-
cials lost their caps and the Vegas showgirls couldn't
keep their feathers down.
-Ruth Lincoln
POINSETTIA BOWL:
UTAH 37, CALIFORNIA 27
The story: Utah was a little slow to start when they
allowed a touchdown by the Bears in the first few min-
utes of the game. When the Bears fell behind in the
third quarter, they lost a fumble after throwing back-
to-back interceptions and fell apart at the seams.
-Amy Scarano
PAPAJOHNS.COM BOWL:
CONNECTICUT 20, SOUTH CAROLINA 7
You knew it was over when: Connecticut led 20-0
early in the fourth quarter. The Huskies defense com-
pletely shut down South Carolina's offense all game.
Connecticut controlled the time of possession battle
35:28 to 24:32, allowing its offense to remain on the
field and sustain drives.

two TDs.

MUSIC CITY BOWL:
CLEMSON 21, KENTUCKY 13
You knew it was over when: With just over five
minutes to play, Kentucky decided to go for it on
fourth-and-eight. QB Morgan Newton came up just
inches short on a quarterback keeper, allowing Clem-
son to run out the clock from there.
The least shocking part of the game: That Clem-
son running back CJ Spiller scored a touchdown. Spill-

the Tigers, breaking a school record.

Armed Forces Bowl:
Air Force 47, Houston 20
MVP: The entire Air Force secondary. With the
threat of cannon-armed Case Keenum looming from
the Houston huddle, Air Force's top-ranked pass
defense absolutely obliterated any hopes of a Hous-
ton win. Keenum was picked off a career-high six
times And for a guy who managed nearly 6,000 yards
through the air this season, holding Keenum to just
over 200 was an enormous victory. Keenum looked vis-
ibly frustrated out there, and for good reason. Houston
never had a chance. And to think, Keenum was an early
favorite for the Heisman Trophy.

HAWAII BOWL:
SMU 45, NEVADA 10
You knew it was over when: SMU coach June
Jones stepped out of the plane in Hawaii. After leav-
ing the paradise to rejuvenate a scarred football pro-
gram at SMU, Jones knew that a return to Hawaii
would serve up only good karma for a coach that saw
so much success in the state before. The Nevada run
game, which boasted three 1,000-yard rushers, was
relatively shut down, and quarterback Colin Kae-
pernick couldn't get it going. The victory serves as
a stepping stone that looks like it might bring SMU
back from the proverbial dead in terms of college
football. June Jones has shown that he is definitely
capable of turning around this program, and don't be
surprised if in a year or two Jones gets a new, shiny
job offer from a big school. Maybe then he won't have
to go to the Hawaii Bowl ... again.
-Ryan Kartje
EMERALD BOWL:
USC 24, BOSTON COLLEGE 13
MVP: Matt Barkley, USC. Though this was USC's
first non-BCS bowl in what seems an eternity, the
Trojans finished fifth in the Pac-lO, and the team was
experiencing off-the-field issues with Joe McKnight
and three other's academic ineligibility, USC played a
very solid bowl game and came away with a victory. It
began a nervy affair for Matt Barkley, the Trojan quar-
terback, but as the game progressed, his influence was
made known. Even after two interceptions, he threw a
48-yard bomb to receiver Damian Williams and scored
on the next play.
-Zell Zoerhoff
ROADY'S HUMANITARIAN BOWL:
IDAHO 43, BOWLING GREEN 42
I didn't change the channel because: This game
was the ultimate shootout between two teams that
like to sling the ball. The schools combined for 990
yards of total offense. With four seconds left in the
game, Idaho quarterback Nathan Enderle threw a
16-yard pass to Max Komar to notch the score at 42
apiece.
MVP: With the score tied at 42 late in the fourth
quarter, that's when Idaho coach Robb Akey decided
not to kick the customary extra point and go to over-
time. Instead, Akey went for it all in the waning sec-
onds with a two-point conversion attempt. Enderle
performed a three-step drop and threw a rope to the
middle of end zone to clinch the win.
-Mark Burns
St. Petersburg Bowl:
Rutgers 45, Central Florida 24
I didn't change the channel because: MTV's
"Jersey Shore" wasn't on, and I wanted to re-connect
with my New Jersey roots. But seriously ... It was
worth watching just to see how brutal the beatdown
would be. Rutgers was pretty much in control from
the start of the game, and the only "yikes" moment
came in the second quarter when Central Florida
pulled within four points. But when a backup defen-
sive back has a pick-six, and when a freshman quar-
terback puts up a Peyton Manning-esge 294 passing
yards, it's honestly a blow out (like The Situation's
hairdo).

Wolverines still managed to hang

There were 15 lead changes and
12 ties en route to the three-point
Ohio State victory. While the
Buckeyes (4-0, 16-1) out-rebound-
ed Michigan 36 to 29, the Wolver-
ines shot better from the field by
10 percent.

"I thought we played well,"
Borseth said.
"We had to. They are obviously
very good. Down the stretch we
gave ourselves a chance to win,
which is what we want to be able
to do."
The Wolverines are still look-
ing for a way to win in the Big Ten
as they get deeper into conference
play.
They hope to utilize home-
court advantage on Thursday
against conference foe Iowa, a

team they narrowly beat on the
Hawkeyes' home turf last month.
"We have to find a way to win,"
sophomore forward Carmen
Reynolds said.
"That's our focus, that's always
been our focus. We have to find
a way to get it done. We are not
going to be satisfied with just los-
ing by three to the best team in

to do."

KARTJE
From page 1B
Turco might have shown itself.
"(Hogan) showed he could play
in a game where he had to make
the difference," Berenson said
before the season started. "He has
showed me that, and I just thought
that he reminded me of Turco."
After witnessing Berenson tell
Hogan to take a seat for the third
period of Michigan's first-round
matchup againstRensselaer Poly-
technic in last week's Great Lakes
Invitational, you have to wonder if
he still feels the same way.
Because when the Wolverines
captured the 1998 National Cham-
pionship - the last time Turco or
any Michigan goalie lifted the tro-
phy - Berenson sure didn't relieve
his prized goaltender of his duties
with the expectation that backups
Gregg Malicke or Greg Dadario
would stand on their head.
So when junior goalie Shawn
Hunwick skated to the Michigan
goal to start the third period yes-
terday - his first game action since
the 2007-08 season - Berenson
came to terms with reality, right
before our eyes.
Bryan Hogan is no Marty

Turco.
And Bryan Hogan is not a cham-
pionship goalie.
Sure, the brunt of the blame for
a reeling hockey team will always
fall on its goaltender and Hogan
is clearly notthe only one at fault
for the team's record. A litany of
issues have plagued Michigan this
season.
But after facing justfive shots
from the Engineers, Hogan and
the Wolverines were looking at a
3-1 deficit - a nearly inexcusable
mark no matter how unearned the
goals may have appeared.
Even at that, it was the third
goal that broke the camel's back.
With Michigan trailing by only
one goal, Hogan looked like he had
a routine save to his glove side that
most likely would have left the
Wolverines down just one heading
into the final period.
But when the puck slipped off
of Hogan's glove and into the net,
Berenson made the only decision
he could to save his team's chance
ata third-straight GLI Champion-
ship.
Was it the right decision in the
end? I think so.
Although the Engineers slipped
the fourth and backbreaking goal
just over Hunwick's shoulder,

where a five-inchheight advantage
might have helped Hogan stop it,
the move did seem to sparkthe
Wolverines, who scored two third-
period goals.
"Any time there's a goalie
change, especially with a guy
like Shawn Hunwick who's a real
character guy in the locker room,
it could be a big morale booster,"
senior captain Chris Summers
said. "Whether it was a change
because Hogan was there or wasn't
there, guys look atethat and say
something needs to change, and it
trickles through the team."
Don't get me wrong, Hogan
will likely take his place between
the pipes for the team's remain-
ing regular season schedule. Even
Berenson wasted no time in call-
ing him "their guy" following the
Wolverines' 5-3 win over Michigan
Tech in the consolation game.
But after pulling him against
RPI, Berenson, like everyone else,
should realize that with Hogan
as Michigan's only viable option,
it could be awhile longer before
anyone makes another Turco com-
parison. Or lifts a National Cham-
pionship trophy.

MY TWO ANN ARBORS
MEANS DRIVING DOWN THE
BY SIAN DOWIS

Most of you probably only have
one Ann Arbor, but for me
there are two -the Ann Arbor
of my old life, and that of my new. My
old life-Ann Arbor revolves around
my childhood home near the Huron
River, and my school, Community
High School. It's made up of nature
trails, cobblestone streets and places
like the Farmers Market, the YMCA,
the People's Food Co-op and, of course,
the Arb. My new life-Ann Arbor orbits
around my East Quad dorm room. It
contains the Diag, the fishbowl, the
'UGLI, the CCRB, a plethora of late-
night dining establishments and, well,
this one also includes the Arb.
Of course there's overlap. I walked
through the Diag and ate Backroom
pizza when I was in high school. And
I still go back to my parent's home, buy
groceries at the Co-op and work out
at the Y. In my mind, however, they
remain two separate worlds.
I had never imagined that I'd spend
my college years where I was born and
raised. In high school, I had plans of
going far away for college. I thought
Ann Arbor was boring and tiny, and
[From LEGEND, Page 5C]
Slowly, she returned to her feet, cov-
ered inblood.
Red jokes today that it was a lesson
learned in always keeping the focus on
what's in front of you - in life and track.
There's a consensus among those
who know Red well, that one of his
greatest strengths as a coach was never
making track the focus of life. Rather,
life became the focus of track. While
Kraker Goodridge did go on to become
a two-time Olympian, Red understood
that not all of his athletes would be as
successful as her.
Kraker Goodridge later became a
coach and coordinated women's athlet-
ics for 26 years, first at the University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, then at the
University of Michigan and Wake For-
est University, and she says Red's advice
went with her wherever she went.
"I don't know what I would have
been in my life," Kraker says. "That's
what every young woman that he's
touched over the years would say.
Whatever their level of success as a
runner was, it was that it gave them
something so special that it deter-

I constantly spoke of leaving for one
coast or the other. I figured getting out
of the Midwest was the only way col-
lege was going to be fun, an adventure.
I was 16,1 was naive and I was wrong.
I applied to the University of Michi-
gan because, really, it seemed silly not
to. Shortly after, though, I realized
Michigan was absolutely the college
I wanted to attend. The challenge
became making it feel like a normal
college experience seven minutes
away from my house. Over time, I cre-
ated invisible lines in my head, dividing
"college Ann Arbor" with "non-college
Ann Arbor." It helps me feel as if I'm
really going away somewhere, and
really coming home.
Walking around campus during
winter break, however, is disconcert-
ing. The streets and storefronts become
strikingly empty. It reminds me of
pictures of celebrities without their
makeup: familiar, bare and sometimes
depressing. It's not natural. It doesn't
feel like my "college Ann Arbor." Occa-
sionally, I find I enjoy the peacefulness,
the lack of crowds. There's a certain
harsh, barren beauty to it all. But more
mined the course of their lives."
Red grabs a small photo album off

ners like Kraker Goodridge, all wear-
ing Michigammes track uniforms,
their faces lit up with bright smiles.
Despite its official passage four
years earlier, the University fully
implemented Title IX in 1976. That
same year, Canham called Red into his
office and offered him the job as the
head coach of the women's track team.
Though Red had been waiting nearly
two decades for this opportunity, he
still had one demand.
"I said right away, 'Well, I would like
that but I'm not taking this job travel-
ing around the country, I'm not going
out on the road under those conditions
alone. My wife is going with me or I
don't take it,"' Red recalls telling Can-
ham. "Canham says, 'Fine. She's Mrs.
Coach."'

To the left of the photo album sits
a large portrait of Forshee-Crane and
Red from the '70s. A wrinkled smile
stretches across his face as he looks at
the photograph. "Look at those dim-
ples," he says nostalgically.
Watching Red gaze at the photo, a
thought comes to mind. Maybe after
all these years, it turns out that Red
wasn't ahead of his time. Maybe,
instead, he was right on time. Right on
time for athletes like Kraker and For-
shee-Crane. Right on time to convince
Canham to allow him to train young
women in Yost Fieldhouse. Right on
time become the first coach of female
track and field at the University of
Michigan. Right on time.
"You know," he says, looking at his
Penn Relays watch just before he flips
off the light and starts to climb-up the
stairs to meet his wife, "I think it works
even better now than the day I got it."
Yes Coach, some things just get bet-
ter with age. -

15 more minutes, enough time for one
last story.
In October 1995, shortly after Lloyd
Carr had been named head football
coach at the University, Red knocked
on his office door. Asking only for a
minute of his time, Red gave Carr what
the former football coach considers to
be some of the greatest advice he ever
received.
Opening his hand, Red placed a
small medal on Carr's desk. "Read
what it says," Red told Carr.
"Health. Family. Friends."
"He said, 'Lloyd, when you're
through coaching, make sure that you
still have these three things. They're
the most important things in life,' "
Carr recalls during an interview in his*
office. "I will always be grateful to him
for taking the time to reach out to me."
For all the seasons Carr coached,
the medal stayed in a desk drawer in
his office.
"I think his motivation comes from
being able to take a young person and
help them gain the confidence and the
belief that they can do special things.
To me, that's what coaching is," Carr

says. "It's about teaching and motivat-
ing and being there when the down
times corte. Because for every athlete,
in any sport for any length of time, you
have to deal with injury, you have to
deal with defeat, you have to deal with
personal problems.
"Red understood the big picture.
He understood that there's more to life
than just track and field."
TEN YEARS AGO, for Red's.
90th birthday, former-Mich-
igamme Ann Forshee-Crane
presented him with a photo album.
Inside, on yellow paper, she wrote,
"Dear Coach, We met over 30 years
ago. I was a scrawny pig-tailed kid with
braces, you looked just as you do now.
"You offered me the opportunity
to be an athlete long before girls and
women were defined as such. You
taught me to set goals, work hard and
not be afraid to sweat.
"It's impossible to adequately put
into words how significantly you
impacted the course of my life. For
thirty years I've called myself a runner.

random student interview


It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine ... sometimes. The aughts have been some of the most tumultuous years in
Michigan football history. Under Lloyd Carr, the Wolverines went 73-27 in regular season games. Then the team lost
to Appalachian State. During the 2007 Capital One Bowl, Carr's Wolverines defeated the Florida Gators, the previous
year's national champions. And then came Rich Rodriguez, the electrifying spread offense and hopes of landing Ter-
relle Pryor, who was going to lead Michigan football to glory. But Pryor never
arrived, reality soon set in, and under Rich Rod the team went a dismal
8-16 in two seasons, arguably the worst stretch in Michi-
gan football history. Here's to twenty ten, and the
hope that Rodriguez will find his stride in the new
decade. If not, we might see some "Rich Rod
wears Uggs" T-shirts in the near future. u e',

Hi. Is this Kelsie?
Yes it is. Who is this?
Kelsie, my name's Trevor Cale-
ro. I'm the magazine editor at The
Michigan Daily and we're doing
this new thing called Random
Student Interview. You're the
first one. I was wondering if you'd
be willing to do an interview with
me? Yeah, I guess that's OK. I'm in
the car right now but I have a little
bit of time.
Are you driving? Yes I am.
I don't want you to get into a car
accident because you're talking
on the phone. Oh no, it's fine. Don't
worry about it.
OK. What were your new years
resolutions? One was to exercise
every day.
You and every other student at
the university. Yeah, I know. That's
annoying. Because the gym is always
packed the first month of the year.
Why do you think that is? Just
cause everyone falls off their resolu-
tion.

Are you going to fall off? I hope
not. What's your resolution?
Mine's just as lame as yours, to
eat healthier, which is extreme-
ly ambiguous and really means
nothing.
[Laughs.]
And also to go to the gym more,
so I'll be seeing you there.
[Call cuts out.]
[Ring, ring, ring.]
Hey sorry I think I cut out.
No, that was my fault, someone
was calling and I tried to ignore
them but I just turned the phone
off. So are you curious how I got
your number? I'm guessing it was
off of the umich directory.
No. So I was randomly Face-
booking people and trying to
find people who published their
phone numbers online, but
it's harder than I thought. But
one of my friends went on one
of those, I-lost-my-phone-so-
can-you-give-me-your-number
Facebook groups, Mandy (last
name removed), my friend knows

Mandy, and you are friends with
Mandy. Oh, wait, that's so creepy.
Mandy and I went to middle school
together.
Well, you gave Mandy your cell
phone number on Facebook. Wow,
I'm not going to lie, that's a little
creepy.
It's a little creepy. How does it
make you feel that some random
guy can look up your number on
the Internet? I think I might take
it off.
So who's this girl on your Face-
book profile pic? Oh, that's one of
my friends. This is really creepy.
Yeah. But I guess everybody
Facebook stalks.
Do you Facebook stalk? Of
course you do. Whats the worst
Facebook stalking you've ever
done? The worst?
Yeah, the thing you'd most
regret if other people knew. The
most time I Facebook stalk is when I
have a big exam and...
Oh I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about, like, creeping

on some boy, or an ex-boyfriend...
I think that creeping on an ex-boy-
friend is understandable.
Have you ever met someone and
all you know about them is their
first name and what they look like,
andthenyou spendhours onFace-
book tryingto find their profile? I
don't think I've ever done that.
Yeah, I've done that.
[Awkward laughing.]
So if you meet a girl, and you
learn her first name and you know
who she's friends with ... so you
kind of have this trail to track
her down. But then it's, like, she
doesn't remember me, and she
obviously didn't want to remem-
ber me cause she didn't give me
her last name, so do you friend
her? I don't know. It's very tricky.
That's true.
I'll let you go now, you probably
have to be somewhere.

Civil Rights Initiative. At one time, the
state of Michigan believed in diversity,
allowing its public universities to prac-
tice affirmative action. Then in Nov.
2006, voters passed the statewide Civil
Rights Initiative, or Proposal 2, forcing state
universities to do away with race-based admis-
sion practices. The University, always priding itself
on its diverse student body, suddenly saw a seven per-
cent decrease in the number of minority students admitted.

The new kid on the block. Although the election of Barack Obama as the first black
president of the United States will undoubtedly go down as some of the biggest news
of the last decade, the University community had one of its own presidential firsts. In
August of 2002, Mary Sue Coleman became the 13th president of the University and,
more notably, its first female president. Though not quite as outspoken as some of the
former presidents, Coleman has helped redefine the role of a university presi-
dent by placing a greater emphasis on development efforts at the
University. The Coleman-led Michigan Difference campaign, which
ended in 2008, raked in $3.2 billion, making it the largest capital
campaign by any public university in the country.

The joys of (social) networking. Remember life before Facebook? Didn't think so. Don't worry, we can't either.
Love 'em or hate 'em, social networking sites have become so ingrained in our lives that it's almost impossible
to live without them. From the now-prehistoric MySpace in 2003 to Facebook's launch in 2004, and right on
through to the 140-character-phenomenon that is Twitter. While the economy may have been crashing right out-
side our bedrooms, these Internet megaliths were booming within the confines of our Firefox windows, giving us
such well-known phrases as "unfriending," "tweets" and "STFU." Who knows where social networking will go in
the next decade, but we sure as hell want to be there.

The bong strikes back. Oh, Michael Phelps. What a career you've had. As the Univer-
sity's one-time golden boy, Phelps was the most adorable thing to don a swim cap since,
well, ever, attended the University, trained in Ann Arbor for years and will go down as
one of the greatest athletes of all time. After winning six gold and two bronze med-
als at the 2004 Athens Olympics, Phelps continued his reign in Beijing in 2008
by bringing home eight first-place titles. And then it was over. In 2009, Phelps
got caught by a camera phone and a capitalizing party-goer. With a bong in
hand, Phelps got high. While this smear on Phelps' reputation probably won't be
remembered 10 years from now, we'd be lying if we said we won't be name drop-
ping when Phelps makes his fifth Olympic appearance in 2020.

news in review

conomy shmashmonomy. While some economists are "optimistic" things will improve in the future,
ost agree that any improvement will be from bad to, well, less bad. Michigan is in the unlucky group of
ates that has been hit particularly hard by the Great Recession. Near the end of the last decade, Michi-
an had the highest unemployment rate of any state in the union at 15 percent. But hey, there's always
rad school or Teach for America.

Five of the most talked-about stories of the week, ranked in order of actual importance


1

The decline of a giant. What was once arguably the center of the world's auto market came
crashing down at the tail end of the decade. While there may still have been a chicken in every
pot, there certainly wasn't a Ford in every driveway. Years from now, Obama's decision to bail
out the automakers may go down as one of the most pivotal decisions of his admin-
istration. Some saw the bailout as a necessity to keep the economy afloat, while
others felt it slapped the free market in the face. Like a neon pink
broad-tipped marker, the bailout put a highlight on the financial
and employment troubles for the state of Michigan
and the country.

We know it's the Rose Bowl. And
we know the Big Ten hasn't won in
over a decade. But come on. This
is Ohio State we're talking about.

a Big Ten win or an OSU loss?

Obama. Period. Nov. 4, 2008 saw what was undoubtedly the most historic presidential election to date. What
made it even cooler was the fact that for most University students, it was the first election we had been eligible
to vote in, and everyone loves to be part of an historic event. When the election was called and Barack Obama
was named the 44th president of the United States, the streets of Ann Arbor were flooded with his supporters
celebrating both the victory and the significance of the first Black president-elect. Though Obama has come
under criticism lately, we're curious to see what he does next and the kind of impact he will undoubtedly have
going into this new decade.

Operation Iraqi Freedom. No war has so divided the country like the current one in
Iraq since the U.S.'s involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s. Under President Bush,
a multinational force led by the U.S. and the United Kingdom invaded
Iraq on March 20, 2003under the claim that the country pos-
sessed weapons of mass destruction. Though evidence of
WMDs has yet to be discovered, our troops remain oversees
with American military casualties exceeding 4,300. While
there have been talks of withdrawal, action has yet to
be taken. Whether you agree with the war or not,
everyone has an opinion and will be watching for
Obama's next move in Iraq.

RUNNING
WITH EGEND

his wife, Betty, whom he had met while in college
(Betty died in 1974, and Red later remarried, to
Lois). The two went only as spectators, watching
from the grandstands as Rudolph won three gold
medals.
But as he watched Rudolph's stunning perfor-
mances as a sprinter, and compared them with the
general poor showing from the U.S. Olympic wom-
en's distance team, Red thought he had found the
missing link - coaching.
Rudolph succeeded in the Rome Olympics
because she was well coached, Red says. Sitting in
the stands, he and Betty decided to return to Ann
Arbor with the goal of finding a naturally gifted
young female runner to coach to Olympic-level
quality. And he was going to do it at the University
- . of Michigan.
Red was teaching weight train-
ing classes at the University, while
also studying to receive his masters
degree in Physical Education. He was
well acquainted with the Athletic Department.
"I went to talk to the (Michigan Athletic
Director) at the time, Don Canham, and he says,
'Women? Running? Sweating? They're not sup-
posed to do that,' " Red recalls with a laugh and
a shake of his head. "But I kept after him and he
finally said, 'Well, how many do you have?' And I
said, 'I haven't gotten any yet."'
After receiving the go-ahead from Canham, Red
asked his wife to pick out the best female athlete
at Slauson Middle School in Ann Arbor, where she
taught at the time. Betty chose Francie Kraker
Goodridge, who had no idea that she would become
a part of Michigan athletic history.
"It was thrown right at me,"
Kraker Goodridge says, sitting
across from me on a brisk fall
afternoon. "(Red asked), 'Would
you like to train for the Olym-
pics?' I mean, woah, I was 14."
So with a pair of recycled
shoes that Red had pulled out of
a bin at Yost, the all-female women's track club,
Michigammes, was born. And although they didn't
know it at the time, Simmons and Kraker Goo-
dridge had laid the groundwork for what would
eventually become varsity female tracksat the Uni-
versity.
Looking back, it's hard for Kraker Goodridge
to imagine the impact she would have on not only
track and field at the University, but all sports for
women. At the time, women had no place to train;
they weren't even in the conversation when it came
to athletics. But here was Red, offeringa place for
her to grow and compete just like one of the boys.
In the winter of 1961, when every varsity team
was fighting for time in Yost, Red and Kraker
Goodridge experienced their first taste of adver-
sity, surprisingly, from the man who had initially
allowed them in.
"He was kind of a rough character," Kraker Goo-
dridge says of Canham with a disquieted smile.
"He'd look at me and he'd just spit on the track. Lit-
erally, right in front of me with just this evil look."
Amid all the controversy of the day, those who
said women and athletics don't mix, Red pushed
on.
"Truly, he danced to a different drummer," for-
mer Michigan football coach Lloyd Carr says of
Red. "He wasn't interested in the mentality that
was there at the time that he began to work with
women. He's one of those guys that followed his
passion and certainly personifies, in my judgment,
the idea that if you follow your own dreams then
you're going to makea huge difference."
N EARLY SUMMER, before Kraker Goo-
dridge's junior year of high school, she took a
hard spill on the outdoor cinder track at Yost
when she looked behind her during a workout and
lost concentration. In a flash, her body crashed
against the cinders. [See LEGEND, Page 8C]

he greatest personal collection ofMichigan athletic history
can be found in a most unlikely place: in the cold, dingy
basement of a three-story townhouse off South Main Street.
The floor is cluttered with scrapbooks and boxes of
memorabilia. The tables and shelves are like intricate games of dominos;
removing one item would undoubtedly disrupt the chaotic perfection.
"Down the stairs and to the left," a voice calls. "The light switch is on
your left hand side. I'll be down in a moment."

years together, this timepiece has seen the unlike-
ly story of a man who changed the face of sports at
the University of Michigan. The watch is a witness
to the life of this quiet legend.
Ever faithful, the watch ticked on as Red spent
25 years on the Detroit Police force, where he com-
peted in races and perfected his weight-training
regimen. The watch was there when Red proposed
the idea of a women's track team to then-Michi-
gan Athletic Director Don Canham - a legend of
Michigan athletic folklore in his own right. It saw
the discovery of Red's first prot6g6 on the track,
and, for the next 16 years, it loyally calculated the
splits of the girls who traveled across the state to
be coached by the man who dared to call women
athletes.
And after all these years, the watch hands still
tick past the hour markers.
"See, it still works," he says with a satisfied
grin.
ED WAS BORN January 5, 1910 in Red-
ford, Mich. - a small farming community
1 just west of Detroit. Red's eighth-grade
teacher, Mr. Pontius, spotted a talent in the young
man and asked his parents to allow him to attend
nearby Redford High School so he could train to
be a runner. Pontius had convinced the farmers in
town to mow a track into the field behind Beech
Road Middle School. And it's here, in Redford,
off 7 Mile Road, where Red and a few other boys
would train after school.
Red discovered he had natural talent and soon

developed into a great runner. In the fall of 1929
he enrolled at Michigan State Normal College -
now Eastern Michigan University - after he gar-
nered the attention of coach Lloyd Olds.
"I didn't have anything for (the first) month
and a half, maybe longer," Red says. "I hitchhiked
... and every day I carried my lunch, went to class
and never bought a book."
He washed wrestling mats in the basement
of the school's gymnasium to pay for tuition -
which cost $18.50 per semester.
Red points to a photo in his basement, torn at
all four corners and matted behind a dark mahog-
any frame. It's a picture of his eighth grade class.
"He changed my life," Red says, pointing to Mr.
Pontius in the back row. "If it hadn't been for
this man, none of this stuff would have been here
today." Red looks around his basement, survey-
ing the images, before turning and pointing to
himself.
Next to this hangs another memorable image
for Red: a photo of his mile relay team at Michi-
gan Normal. Despite being a hurdler, Red wanted
a spot on the relay team because he knew it had
the best chance at a national championship. For
three years he won the fourth spot in the time
trials.
At the Penn Relays in Philadelphia in 1932, Red
received a perfect handoff and a four-stride lead
going into the second leg of the race. The lead
lessened during Red's 400 meters, but it didn't
matter. His teammates knew it would be difficult
for anyone to catch him.

After winning the race, the four runners were
led to a man seated at the awards table near the
far end of the track. The man asked for Red's
name.
"Kenneth G. Simmons," he responded, as the
man pried the glass face off of a small golden
watch and wrote his name between the hour
markers.
ED CHECKS HIS watch: an hour until din-
ner. Plenty of time, he says, for more stories.
He gets up from the rocking chair and
walks over to an old photograph clipped from a
Detroit newspaper in 1937. "Kenneth Simmons,
Detroit policeman, captures the 100-yard dash,"
the caption reads. Red is pictured onthe inside lane,
head thrown back, as he pushes his chest forward
and he sav 'WIomen IRunnincj S
to beat the other competitors with a lean.
"I call this one 'Daddy just made 12 dollars,' he
says.
Red graduated from Michigan Normal in 1933
with a degree in Education, entering the workforce
during the darkest year of the Great Depression.
Luckily for Red, the Detroit Police Department
had heard of the "Crimson Flash" from Ypsilanti
and wanted him for its track team. The police track
circuit paid cash prizes back then for the first four

spots in each race, and Red was runningup fo seven
events a meet.
He had no intention of staying on the force for
long, he just needed some money to get by until he
could find a job as a track coach and teacher. He'd
make some money in the police circuit races and
then be out ina year or two, he thought.
"It didn't get over in a year. And the next thing
you know, I've got 12 1/2 years in the police depart-
ment," Red says, pointing out the knife wounds on
his hands and the bullet slugs in his legs. "They're
still there," he says. "I promise." He went on to
spend 25 years in the force, leaving in 1959 after
becoming pension eligible.
As he got older, Red's natural speed no longer
proved enough to win like he used to. He realized
he needed to find a way to make himself stronger
and placed a call to the
~- ) 0 C n NewYorkBarbellClub. He
soon began training with
wea q ~i"' weights. Through stud-
ies of anatomy, Red put
together a fitness routine
that helped prolonghis racingcareer until he was in
his mid 80's. Red would bring this weight regimen
with him when he went on to coach women's track
at Michigan, implementing it at around the same
time the football team began lifting weights.
ILMA RUDOLPH WAS the star of the
1960 Olympics in Rome, setting a world
record in the 200-meter dash from the
inside lane. Red had made the trip to Italy with

After a few minutes perusing the seemingly
endless wall of photos, light footsteps are heard
descending the stairs, and into this shrine of Mich-
igan sports history walks Red Simmons, the father
of women's sports at the University of Michigan.
He takes a seat in a wooden rocker, his leather
moccasins tapping lightly against the frigid floor.
Red celebrated his 100th birthday yesterday, but
if you happened across him on the street or in the
gym - where he still works out five days a week
- you wouldn't be able to tell. His hair is flecked
with red strands; his blue eyes shine with the vigor
of a man years his junior.
Shifting his weight in the chair, Red pulls up
the sleeves of his navy Michigan sweater, reveal-
ing what his eyes and hair could not show. For a

moment, he unclenches his fists and wrinkles like
a mountain range form on his hands.
His age is in his skin.
"It's old man skin," he says, only slightly joking.
Red reaches to check the small golden watch on
his left wrist. He has dinner plans with his wife,
Lois, ina few hours, and he wants to make sure he
has enough time to tell his story.
He won the watch in 1932 at the Penn Relays,
then considered the National Championships for
collegiate track. In those days, it clung tight to his
wrist. Looking at it now, hanging loosely on his
slender frame, it's clear the strain 100 years has
put on the man. He didn't have old man skin then,
he jokes.
It's fitting that Red stillhas the watch. In their 78
