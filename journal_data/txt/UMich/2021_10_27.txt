The University of Michigan’s 

enrollment hit an unprecedented 
high 
of 
more 
than 
50,000 

students in Fall 2021, according 
to a release from the University 
Record.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
spoke 
about 
the 

increased University enrollment 
at the University of Michigan 
Board of Regents meeting the 
evening of Oct. 21.

“This fall’s first year class on 

the Ann Arbor campus is our 
largest ever, and our student 
body for the campus is more 
than 50,000 for the first time in 
history,” Schlissel said. “Demand 
for a Michigan education is at 
record highs.”

This fall, the number of 

freshman 
student 
applicants 

rose by about 15,000, reaching 
a total of 79,743. 16,071 were 
offered admission, representing 
a 20% acceptance rate. In 2020, 
the acceptance rate was 26%.

7,290, or 45%, of accepted 

applicants chose to enroll at the 
University — 400 more than the 
previous year, which saw a 41% 
enrollment rate of those who 
were offered admission.

There was a 3% increase in 

total undergraduate enrollment 
this semester, going from 31,329 
enrollees last year to 32,282 
enrollees this year. The number 
of graduate and professional 
school enrollees reached 17,996 
this year, rising from a previous 
enrollment of 16,578.

Within the new class, about 

37% of students identify as 
persons of color, compared to 
34% of students last year. Latinx 
student enrollment saw a 48% 
increase from 433 last year 

to 640 this fall. Black student 
enrollment rose from 305 last 
year to 404 this fall — a rise of 
about 32%.

Student 
organizations 
on 

campus 
have 
criticized 
the 

University’s 
low 
Black 
and 

Latinx enrollment numbers — 
particularly in January when 
the University discontinued the 
Provost Award, which provided 
full 
demonstrated 
need 
for 

some 
out-of-state 
students. 

Latinx students make up 9% 
of the current freshman class, 
compared to 6% last year. While 
Black students make up 6% 
of the current freshman class 
compared to 4% last year.

Out of this term’s freshman 

class, around 50% reside in-state, 
while 45% are domestic out-of-
state and 5% international. 

Additionally, there was an 8% 

rise in transfer students from last 
year. The freshman and transfer 
classes 
combined 
include 

students 
from 
77 
Michigan 

counties, all 50 states, five U.S. 
territories and 70 countries. 

In the Record article, Adele 

Brumfield, 
vice 
provost 
for 

enrollment 
management, 

attributed this rise in enrollment 
to virtual recruitment events and 
the University’s early decision to 
have Fall 2021 classes in person. 
Brumfield also highlighted the 
importance of financial aid in 
promoting student enrollment. 

“The university is committed 

to providing generous financial 
resources, which allows more 
students to choose U-M and 
thrive once they arrive here,” 
Brumfield 
said. 
“With 
the 

admissions season for fall 2022 
in full swing, we’re looking to 
the future and recruiting the 
next talented and diverse class of 
Wolverines.”

The University of Michigan 

endowment grew 40.6% for 
fiscal 
year 
2021, 
totaling 

to $17 billion on June 20, 
2021, Geoffrey Chatas, U-M 
executive vice president and 
chief financial officer, told the 
University of Michigan Board 
of Regents at their Oct. 21 
meeting. 

Despite 
the 
significant 

growth, 
Chatas 
said 
it 
is 

important to look for context 
beyond short-term gains. 

“We’re very pleased with the 

strong performance,” Chatas 
said. “It was as recently as 
2016 that the endowment went 
down in value, and last year, 
the long-term portfolio that 
the endowment is invested in 
gained only 2.3%.”

The University’s endowment 

is the ninth largest in the 
country and third among public 
universities, according to the 
University Record. Over 12,000 
separate 
endowment 
funds 

make up the U-M endowment, 
of which funds are specifically 
designated for scholarships, 
educational 
programs, 

research and professorships. 

Ahead of the Fall 2020 

semester, the Regents voted to 
increase tuition by 1.9% for the 
2020-2021 school year, drawing 
backlash from students and 
parents who pointed to the 
endowment as a way to avoid 
the increase during COVID-
19. The decision was widely 
circulated on social media, 
with many saying they were 
shocked at the tuition increase.

At the meeting, the board 

also voted to name the new 
163,000-square-foot 
building 

set to be on North Campus the 
Leinweber Computer Science 
and Information Building in 
appreciation of the Leinweber 
Foundation 
and 
software 

entrepreneur Larry Leinweber, 
who contributed $25 million to 
support construction. 

The 
new 
center, 
costing 

around $145 million, will be 
home to both the School of 
Information and the College 
of 
Engineering’s 
computer 

science 
and 
engineering 

programs. The building aims 
to bridge the geographical gap 
between those in the School of 
Information and the Computer 
Science 
and 
Engineering 

division of the College of 
Engineering. 

Tom Baird, vice president 

for development, thanked the 
Leinweber 
Foundation 
for 

their donation.

“The 
Leinweber 
family 

members have been wonderful 
volunteers and advocates for 
the University of Michigan for 
many ,many years … (including) 
creating 
the 
Leinweber 

Software 
Scholars 
Program 

at Michigan Engineering and 
establishing 
the 
Leinweber 

Center for Theoretical Physics 
in LSA,” Baird said. 

University President Mark 

Schlissel also announced a 
series of new funding to build 
the Innovation and Technology 
Center at U-M Flint which will 
serve as a base for the recently 
added College of Innovation 
and Technology. Schlissel said 
this investment would help 
both the U-M Flint community 
and the greater Flint region.

University of Michigan 
endowment grows 40.6%
Funds now valued at $17 billion as of June 2021

New class is more diverse than the previous one

Ann Arbor School Parents Intent 

on Racial Equity met virtually with 
members of the Ann Arbor Public 
Schools Board of Education Oct. 
19 to discuss the district’s equity 
plan and what parents said were its 
flaws in protecting Black and brown 
students in the district. 

AASPIRE is a group of parents, 

caregivers, community leaders and 
educators who advocate for racial 
equity within AAPS. They work 
to eliminate the achievement and 
opportunity gaps and to improve 
the educational experience for Black 
and brown students in the school 
district.

The AAPS equity plan, released 

in January 2019, contains five 
main areas of focus: perpetuating 
systems of equity and opportunity; 

promoting 
equity-centered 

leadership; systemic transformation 
of culture; equity-centered school 
and classroom practices; and family 
and community empowerment. 

Oct. 19’s meeting comes after 

numerous allegations of racism 
within AAPS surfaced earlier this 
year. Pioneer High School faces 
allegations of racial hostility after 
an AAPS student sent a letter to the 
district through the Civil Rights 
Litigation Initiative, a Michigan Law 
student-run clinic. The letter, which 
listed three demands to dismantle 
institutional racism in response to 
the racial hostility multiple students 
faced at Pioneer, prompted AAPS to 
offer multiple statements promising 
to begin an investigation to address 
these allegations.

“The stories of the indignities they 

have suffered at Pioneer because of 
their race are heart-wrenching and 
disturbing,” the CRLI letter reads. 

“We write this long letter to amplify 
their voices and to strongly urge you 
to redress the systemic racism at 
Pioneer. Black Lives Matter.”

AASPIRE criticizes the equity 

plan, calling it a performative act 
for racial equity. They said the plan 
puts the blame on Black and brown 
children for their performance at 
school, fails to specify accountability 
measures or assign responsibilities, 
does not offer a timeframe for 
completion and does not state the 
problem it is trying to solve.

Board members Bryan Johnson, 

Jessica Kelly and Krystle DuPree 
were present at the meeting. 
When asked what BOE’s role was 
in constructing the equity plan, 
Johnson said though various AAPS 
stakeholders contributed to the 
equity plan, they are responsible 
for 
setting 
guidance 
for 
the 

superintendent and steering the 
district strategy that captures the 

values of the district.

“There were members of the 

cabinet and teachers and other 
equity teams across the district that 
put in a lot of work to create an equity 
plan,” Johnson said. “They then 
send it to the Board of Education to 
talk about it and look to see if there 
are things that were missing, and to 
approve it for a public unveiling.” 

When asked about the timeline 

for 
implementing 
the 
equity 

plan, Johnson said the pandemic 
has slowed the process. They 
are currently revising the plan, 
according to Johnson. 

“In terms of the rollout, when 

the community could be engaged, 
that was actually going to be in 
March of 2020, with the 2020-2021 
school year as the goal to roll that 
out,” Johnson said. “Just as we were 
doing that, that’s when we had a new 
reality, which was COVID-19.”

More than 100 University of 

Michigan 
students 
protested 

for climate justice on the after-
noon of Oct. 22 as part of a class 
walkout organized by Fridays for 
Future, a global youth movement 
committed to striking for stron-
ger climate policies.

During 
the 
protest, 
stu-

dent activists presented a list 
of demands to the University, 
including that they declare a cli-
mate emergency and fully divest 
from fossil fuels. At the Board of 
Regents meeting last March, the 
University committed to divest-
ing from companies with the 
largest greenhouse gas contri-
butions and to achieving a net-
zero endowment by 2050. This 
vote came after years of activism 
from student groups on campus 

who called on the University to 
take immediate action to reach 
carbon neutrality and divest-
ment. 

Students 
at 
the 
protest 

marched across campus, looping 
around North University Ave-
nue, State Street and South Uni-
versity Avenue. As they walked 
near the Law Quad, many stu-
dent 
protesters 
stopped 
by 

Schlissel’s house, showing sup-
port for the survivors of sexual 
abuse from late University ath-
letic doctor Robert Anderson. 

For more than a week, for-

mer University football player 
Jonathan Vaughn, a survivor 
of Anderson, has staged a sit-in 
outside of Schlissel’s house to 
demand that the University cre-
ate stronger protections for sur-
vivors of sexual abuse and meet 
with Anderson’s victims.[

During their march, students 

repeated “No more coal, no more 
oil, keep that carbon in the soil,” 

“Hey hey, ho ho, climate change 
has got to go” and “Exxon Mobil, 
BP, Shell: take your filth and go 
to hell.” 

LSA sophomore Lexi Crilley, 

who serves on the Students for 
Clean Energy‘s policy team, read 
the demands at the protest. 

“We’re tired of the Univer-

sity’s goals to make more goals,” 
Crilley said. “The endless empty 
promises of the institution. So 
until these demands are met, we 
will continue striking. We’ll keep 
protesting.” 

LSA senior Elena Swirczek 

spoke to the crowd about the 
role of hope in combating cli-
mate change. She said it can be 
difficult to feel optimistic in the 
face of worsening news about 
the climate, such as the report 
published this year by the Unit-
ed Nations’ Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change that 
found that human-created cli-
mate change will raise the globe’s 

temperature by 1.5 to 2.0 dur-
ing the 21st century “unless deep 
reductions in CO2 and other 
greenhouse gas emissions occur 
in the coming decades.” 

Swirczek said despite these 

grim predictions, a “doom and 
gloom” attitude can lead to inac-
tion. 

“Hope is an action that can be 

constant, even when the feeling 
is not,” Swirczek said. “Because 
if we don’t take any action, we’ve 
already lost.” 

Swirczek urged the protes-

tors not to feel like they have 
to be perfect activists to bring 
about progress. Instead, she said, 
they should focus on working 
together to demand system-wide 
changes. 

“Find the people building 

power and join them,” Swirczek 
said.

Jordan Else, a member of 

AASPIRE 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 

resident, 
said 
she 
would 

like to see an increase in 
urgency regarding the rollout 
of the plan and said the 
superintendent needs to lead 
the implementation. 

“Our concerns come in the 

fact that this is taking time,” 
Else said. “We really would 
like a greater sense of urgency. 
When we talk to other districts 
… the things that we hear are 
that we need urgency and that 
we need this to come from the 
top down.” 

One major critique of AAPS’s 

equity plan was its lack of 
specifics, according to Else. 
She said through AASPIRE’s 
investigation of past successful 
equity plans in other school 
districts, they found common 
themes. 

Successful 
plans 
properly 

defined the problem schools 
were 
facing 
and 
provided 

specifics 
on 
accountability, 

which is something the AAPS 
equity plan lacks, Else said. 
One of the successful equity 
plans was the Campaign for 
Racial Equity in Our Schools in 
Chapel Hill, N.C. 

“Through 
this 
problem 

identification and looking at 
the data, successful plans, every 
single one, include specific 
measures and accountability,” 
Else said. “When we look at 
the best practices, they all 
included all stakeholders at 
the beginning of the plan. Not 
having teachers, not having 
students and not having parents 
in this plan is almost sure to set 
it up where it is not going to 
meet everyone’s needs.”

Stacey Ebron, a member of 

AASPIRE and the mother of 
two boys at Lawton Elementary 
School, 
discussed 
how 

identifying the problem is a key 
step in proper implementation. 

“You really need to have 

an 
understanding 
and 

acknowledgement of the ways 
that the school system is set 
up to benefit white children 
and disadvantage children of 
color,” Ebron said. “When we 
look at Chapel Hill’s problem 
statement and AAPS’s equity 
plan, what we are missing is the 
understanding of the problem. 
The mission statement is to 
increase equity, but there is 
no explanation of what the 
problem is, the goals and the 
objectives.”

Angela Guy-Lee, a member of 

AASPIRE and mother of three 
AAPS 
students, 
discussed 

how 
AAPS’s 
definition 
of 

equity does not address the 
responsibility leadership holds 
in solving equity problems in 
schools. 

“When 
everyone 
is 

responsible, no one is actually 
responsible,” 
Guy-Lee 
said. 

“This is a game that institutions 
play, and what they say is ‘All 
of us have a role in fixing this, 
but all of us don’t have power 
to implement change.’ Equity 
at its core is about power. 
You can’t even create a power 
statement that doesn’t address 
the power differentials. This 
kind of statement sounds good, 
it’s performative, it’s fluffy, but 
it doesn’t actually hold anyone 
who’s getting paid to do this 
work accountable.” 

In response to AASPIRE’s 

critiques, Johnson said it is 
important to note that the plan 
is only a draft.

“We are still in somewhat of 

a starting point,” Johnson said. 

AASPIRE also researched 

the equity plans forJefferson 
County 
Public 
Schools 
in 

Kentucky, 
which 
included 

specifics such as quantifiable 
goals 
and 
timeframes. 
On 

promoting 
equity-centered 

leadership, 
JCPS 
included 

specifics such as funding and a 
racial equity analysis protocol 
that was used to review the 
entire district’s school policy.

Ebron 
reiterated 
the 

importance of speeding up 
the process and having more 
community representation in 
tweaking the equity plan.

“It’s past the time that 

parents 
and 
children 
and 

community members should be 
at the table helping to improve 
the equity plan,” Ebron said. 
“We realize that we are in a 
pandemic, but we can’t wait any 
longer because our children are 
still suffering in the Ann Arbor 
Public Schools systems.”

Regarding 
further 

partnership between AASPIRE 
and the BOE, Ebron said they 
hope the information presented 
at 
this 
meeting 
would 
be 

brought to leadership in order 
to implement changes sooner 
rather than later.

“What we hope is, since you 

are not going to let us have 
access to Dr. Swift (AAPS 
superintendent) or the district 
leadership 
team, 
that 
you 

will take these concerns back 
to that team and bring them 
up as part of your board’s 
responsibility in governing this 
equity plan,” Ebron said. “We 
hope we have given you some 
fruitful thought that you can 
act on, because that is what this 
group is all about.”

In 2021, more than 1,700 transfer 

students enrolled at the University of 
Michigan, according to the Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions.While the 
transfer process varies by student and 
the institution they are transferring 
from, over the past year transfer stu-
dents all had to adapt to a virtual cam-
pus community. 

As the University returns to a mostly 

in-person semester, transfer students 
shared with The Michigan Daily their 
experiences and the organizations that 
best supported them on campus dur-
ing the pandemic as well as during their 
first semester on campus. 

Several students transferred to the 

University to attend their dream school, 
as they were not admitted to the Uni-
versity out of high school. Kinesiology 
senior Lior Kolton transferred to the 
University from Michigan State Univer-

sity after his sophomore year. Kolton 

said he did not originally intend to 
transfer but that the switch was worth it 
once he found his community. 

“Once I did really well in my classes 

(at MSU), I thought why not try it out 
and see what happens,” Kolton said. ”I 
think the biggest adjustment was trying 
to find my community on campus and 
find student orgs to get involved in. I’m 
in a pre-law fraternity that’s amazing, so 
trying to find that took a semester, and it 
was a little stressful, but I was very lucky 
to have already had a big school experi-
ence so I kind of knew what to expect.” 

LSA senior Charlotte Gamperle 

transferred to the University as a junior 
from Northeastern University in Bos-

ton because she said she wanted a more 
conventional college experience, as 
Northeastern utilizes a student co-op 
program in which students alternate 
between working and taking classes 
each semester. 

“I just felt like what I was lacking (at 

Northeastern) was community and the 
traditional college experience,” Gam-
perle said. “It kind of detracted from my 
overall college experience because I felt 
like I was a younger professional rather 
than a college student, and I realized 
that I am in no hurry to rush into the 
professional world if I’m going to be in it 
for the rest of my life.”

When applying to college out of high 

school, Gamperle said the University 
was not on her radar. After researching 
the best schools for student life, she said 
she discovered the University almost 
immediately and was drawn to the cul-
ture of school spirit. 

Entering campus in the fall of 2020, 

Gamperle said she knew the adjustment 
would not be easy, as she was seeking 
an inclusive campus community dur-
ing the peak of the pandemic. She said 
being part of the Global Scholars Pro-
gram and joining student organizations 
helped, and she also tried to reach out to 
as many students as possible. 

“Even though it was uncomfortable 

a lot of the time, I would basically reach 
out to people one on one and ask to meet 
up socially distanced, and I did that 
until it got cold,” Gamperle said. “I think 
it was worth it in the long run because I 
have a good set of people now.”

Gamperle said Transfer Connec-

tions, a student organization that facili-
tates peer and faculty mentoring, helped 
her find her place on campus. 

According to the Office of New 

Student Programs, through Transfer 
Connections each transfer student 
serving as a mentee, is matched with 
a former transfer student mentor and 
faculty mentor to assist them in finding 
on-campus opportunities after trans-
ferring. 

“They’ve been really helpful tailor-

ing my Michigan experience to me, 
and just being there for me,” Gamperle 
said. “This year I actually came back as a 
mentor myself. I have a group of 18 men-
tees that have come in this year, and my 
job is to meet with them as often as I can 
and plan social events.”

Other on-campus resources for 

transfer students include M-Connect 
and 
SuccessConnects. 
M-Connect 

assists students looking to transfer from 
community colleges, and SuccessCon-
nects pairs transfer students with an 
individual mentor to help them find 
communities on campus. 

Kolton, who transferred right before 

the pandemic began, said the Universi-
ty’s orientation program was extremely 
helpful. 

“The orientation they ran was fan-

tastic, and I met a cool friend of mine,” 
Kolton said. “He’s actually in class 
with me but transferred over as well. I 
thought that was a really good way to 
help me adjust.”

In an email to The Daily, Michael 

Hartman, assistant director of LSA 
Student Recruitment for Transfer Ini-
tiatives and Partnerships, said assisting 
transfer students during the pandemic 
has been more difficult than normal.

“Some of our transfers will have 

spent more of their semester learning 
remotely than they have had on campus 
by the time they graduate,” Hartman 
wrote.

Gamperle said the virtual events 

planned by the University during the 
completely remote semester when she 
transferred were not beneficial. 

“Because so much of the concern 

when you’re transferring is all about 
finding a community, I think that was 
really difficult to do in the virtual for-
mat,” Gamperle said. “I didn’t really gain 
anything from the University in terms 
of finding community here or finding 
my place. It was more self-directed of 
me seeking people out and seeking out 
my own resources like Transfer Con-
nections.”

Hartman said resources such as 

the LSA Transfer Student Center, the 
Undergraduate Research Opportunity 
Program, optiMize as well as Transfer 
Connections are helpful for transfer 
students to become more embedded in 
the University community and engage 
with other transfer students.. 

“Going to office hours to connect 

with faculty can make all the difference 
in improving the transfer experience,” 
Hartman said.

Like most freshmen, Gamperle said 

she experienced the nervousness that 
accompanies arriving on campus for the 
first time and emphasized the impor-
tance of putting yourself out there. 

“I know it can be really hard and 

uncomfortable, but I think it’s defi-
nitely worth it to try and to meet as 
many people as possible,” Gamperle 
said. “Reach out to professors, just try to 
make as many connections as you can, 
because Michigan does have so many 
resources that are waiting to be taken 
advantage of.”

Every few months, the compost 

bins from the University of Michi-
gan dining halls get picked clean 
— not by a family of raccoons, but 
by a team of researchers in the Civil 
and Environmental Engineering 
department. 

Engineering professor Lutgarde 

Raskin and her research team have 
been gathering samples of food 
waste from U-M students for their 
research. The team is working on a 
$6.8 million dollar project aiming 
to develop biodigesters inspired by 
cows with a goal goal to create an 
efficient and cost-effective way to 
extract energy from organic waste.

According to Mechanical Engi-

neering professor Steve Skerlos, a 
co-investigator on the project, the 
bioreactor is inspired by the cow 
stomach’s efficient digestion of 
tough organic materials.

“A cow just grows on grass, and 

we’re kind of harnessing this bio-
inspired design, which is pretty 
clever and fairly simple,” Skerlos 
said. 

Renisha Karki, CEE doctoral 

pre-candidate on the team, says 
the food waste “smoothie” is fed 
to bacteria growing inside the bio-
reactor, a complex series of tubs 
and tubes stacked on top of tables 
in the corner of the lab. A single 
eraser-sized metal box measures 
the flow rate of the biogas — a mix-
ture of methane and carbon diox-
ide — produced from the system. 
At the same time, Raskin’s collabo-
rators outside the University are 
researching methods to convert 
biogas into renewable natural gas. 

Organic material is broken 

down inside the bioreactor using 
anaerobic digestion, meaning that 
the bacteria digesting the organic 
material do not need oxygen to sur-
vive, Tim Fairley-Wax, a research 
lab specialist and CEE alum, said. 

Fairley-Wax 
said 
anaerobic 

technology is useful because it can 
break down tougher materials like 
sewage sludge or food waste. Cur-
rently, much of the organic waste 
in the United States is thrown into 
landfills or compost piles, where it 
emits large amounts of methane 
into the atmosphere as it decom-
poses. 

“We’re very inefficient in deal-

ing with our waste, we just bury 
and forget about it,” Kuang Zhu, a 
CEE postdoctoral researcher on 
the team, said.

Despite the potential usefulness 

of anaerobic technology in deal-
ing with organic waste, Zhu said 
anaerobic technology is not widely 
implemented.

“It’s costly,” Zhu said. “It’s 

expensive to build and it’s also 
very demanding to operate. There 
is also a slow reaction happening 
within the reactor. The anaerobic 
process takes days to weeks. So this 
means that the organic waste just 
spends a lot of time in the reactor.” 

As such, Fairly-Wax said only 

the wealthiest investors have the 
means to implement anaerobic 
technologies. 

“Chevron and Exxon Mobil 

have financed these anaerobic 
digesters at some Michigan farms,” 
Fairley-Wax said. “But right now 
that technology has to be done 
with a huge investor because it’s 
relatively extremely expensive.”

To solve this problem, Zhu said 

the group hopes to make cost-
effective anaerobic technology for 
widespread use at large industrial 
facilities as well as smaller opera-
tions. 

“We can hopefully use this 

technology (to) reduce the costs 
so that smaller-scale users can uti-
lize them … for a variety of waste 
streams, not limited to just waste-
water sludge,” Zhu said. “It could 
be food waste, could be manure, 
could be a lot of organic waste 
streams.”

Raskin’s group is collaborat-

ing with researchers at Argonne 
National Laboratory and North-
western University who are look-
ing into how biogas can be turned 
into high-purity methane, a renew-
able natural gas that can be used to 
heat homes. 

Heating homes with high-

purity methane still emits carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere, Sker-
los noted, making this research a 
necessary “short-term win” until 
a future with no greenhouse gas 
emissions can be reached. 

“It’s not a perfect win. A perfect 

win is when you take that methane, 
and you emit no carbon dioxide 
to the atmosphere,” Skerlos said. 
“(But) carbon dioxide has 50 times 
less greenhouse gas potential than 
methane.”

Meanwhile, the group said that 

their first project outside the lab 
is to retrofit current wastewater 
treatment plants with their biore-
actor system in order to extract and 
utilize energy from food waste. 

Skerlos said wastewater treat-

ment accounts for roughly 4% of 
the electricity used in the United 
States. A large part of energy 

expenditure at wastewater treat-
ment plants is on the sterilization 
of the material generated while 
treating the water, Pedro Puente, 
a CEE doctoral candidate and a 
member of Raskin’s team, added. 

“The goal will be for the waste-

water treatment plants to include 
food waste streams into the treat-
ment, so they can recover even 
more energy,” Puente said. “They 
can become energy neutral or even 
generate their own electricity for 
their operations.”

Skerlos said his team believes 

their bioreactor can reduce costs of 
treating sewage by 25% to 50%. 

“What you’re getting is basi-

cally free power for the wastewa-
ter treatment,” Skerlos said. “And 
you’re also creating free natural 
gas that you can put in the pipeline 
that you didn’t have to frack out 
of the earth. You’re saving a lot of 
money.” 

The team at the University is 

partnering with the Great Lakes 
Water Authority to run a pilot 
system at their water treatment 
plant in Detroit. Skerlos hopes they 
will have a demonstration project 
launched in the next five years. 

“We’re doing this with very cost-

effective technology that can be 
deployed, not only in Detroit and in 
industrialized rich countries, (but 
also) in developing countries (or) in 
very rural locations,” Skerlos said.

Zhu said he remembers being 

shocked when he first learned how 
waste is dealt with and empha-
sized the need for better methods 
of waste disposal. 

“We’re 
getting 
surrounded 

more and more by trash,” Zhu said. 
“Developing solutions to help us 
have a better, more efficient man-
agement of our waste will help us 
have a better relationship with our 
society and our environment. So 
we don’t leave this legacy to our 
next generations.”

The researchers also empha-

sized the importance of recogniz-
ing the amount and type of waste 
humans generate, particularly in 
Ann Arbor where the collection of 
waste is highly regulated. 

“It’s just a matter of education 

on how to separate your waste and 
be responsible about it because the 
waste that you generate is yours,” 
Puente said. “So take advantage of 
the programs that the city offers 
because there are not a lot of places 
that do this separate collection.”

In 2018, the U-M Ann Arbor cam-

pus launched the Go Blue Guaran-
tee program, which grants coverage 
of full tuition for in-state students 
whose families make $65,000 or 
less. In the years since and follow-
ing student activists advocating for 
its expansion, the program has been 
brought to both satellite campuses 
at Flint and Dearborn with an added 
controversial GPA requirement, 
mandating that incoming freshmen 

must have a 3.5 GPA while returning 
students must have a 3.0 GPA. 

Recently, 
however, 
Schlissel 

received backlash from the campus 
community after releasing a survey 
portraying expanded tuition assis-
tance to Flint and Dearborn as aca-
demic and financial burdens for the 
Ann Arbor campus.

The University is the second-

largest provider of financial aid and 
institutional grants to freshmen 
among the nation’s public research 
universities, offering about $256.9 
million. The University budget also 
saw a 6.4% increase in financial 

aid allocation, about a $15.5 million 
increase, according to the Record 
article. 

Brumfield said the University’s 

recruitment efforts were adapted to 
the COVID-19 pandemic world. 

“From what I have learned, col-

laboration increased and partner-
ships were strengthened over the 
past year as the campus united to 
enroll the fall class of 2021,” Brum-
field said.

The University of Michigan Ford 

School of Public Policy hosted a dis-
cussion with Dr. Tedros Adhanom 
Ghebreyesus, director-general of 
the World Health Organization, 
on Oct. 20 in partnership with the 
School of Public Health. Public 
Health Dean F. Dubois Bowman 
moderated the discussion, which 
centered around global responses to 
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

Before being elected into his 

current position in 2017, Dr. Tedros 
worked as Minister of Health for 

Ethiopia’s federal government, 

where he led a major comprehen-
sive reform of the country’s health 
system, and as Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, where he raised health as a 
political issue globally. 

Bowman 
began 
by 
asking 

Tedros how he and his team have 
been able to make decisions during 
the COVID-19 pandemic and in the 
face of intense uncertainty. 

“Public health has been politi-

cized during the pandemic in a way 
we’ve never seen before,” Bowman 
said. “Public health workers have 
faced dangerous and life-threaten-
ing behavior.”

Tedros said health care leaders 

had to ask themselves a variety of 

complex questions in the face of 
the pandemic, and he discussed 
the questions that guide his team in 
their decision-making.

“What 
level 
of 
restrictions 

should be imposed while preserv-
ing individual freedoms? How do 
we allocate resources?” Tedros 
said. “Many of these decisions are 
made under intense pressure from 
the public — the choice to invest in 
primary healthcare and infrastruc-
ture, the choice to give trust to com-
munities through a strong social 
contract.”

Tedros then discussed how the 

politicization of public health has 
led to vaccine inequity. He said 
politicization does not position 
COVID-19 as a common enemy, 
while in reality, that is exactly what 
it is.

“Politicians use the virus to 

score points against their oppo-
nents and to politicize masks and 
vaccination,” Tedros said. “Please 
don’t politicize this, this is a com-
mon enemy; please use other things 
against your opponents. Some will 
follow their leaders and listen to 
them saying not to wear a mask. 
They will get exposed, and the virus 
will continue to spread.”

Tedros emphasized the need for 

vaccine equity, or equal distribu-
tion of the vaccine around the world 
regardless of race or socioeconomic 
status, to make sustainable change 

in stopping the virus from spread-
ing and mutating. As an example to 
show the inequity of the vaccine’s 
distribution, he mentioned that only 
5% of the entire population of Africa 
is fully vaccinated. 

“We are facing a two-track pan-

demic fueled by vaccine inequity,” 
Tedros said. “This is economically 
self-defeating, not only ethically 
immoral; the longer vaccine ineq-
uity exists, the longer the virus can 
mutate.”

LSA sophomore Caroline Dean 

attended the talk and said she feels 
strongly about the consequences 
of making the pandemic a political 
issue. She said she believes the loss of 
lives due to COVID-19 is, at its core, 
caused by the beliefs and actions pro-
moted by political leaders. 

“Politicizing the COVID pan-

demic, in my opinion, is just as 
bad as the pandemic itself,” Dean 
said. “Now that we have a vaccine, 
political incentives are doing the 
killing — life and death should be 
non-partisan, and if we want this 
pandemic to pass with limited loss, 
both sides of the political spectrum 
must first acknowledge the virus 
and its various scientific and public 
health components.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel began the Oct. 21 Board of 
Regents meeting by acknowledging 
the survivors of former University 
athletic doctor Robert Anderson, 
who has been accused of over 2,000 
incidents of sexual abuse. 

One survivor, Jonathan Vaughn, 

a former U-M running back, has 
camped outside of Schlissel’s South 
University residence since Oct. 8 
to raise awareness of the situation 
and demand accountability from 
the University.He has said he will 
continue to do so until Schlissel 
and the Board of Regents agree to a 
meeting with him. 

“We’ve 
heard 
from 
many 

survivors of abuse by Dr. Robert 
Anderson,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“We 

thank them for coming forward and 
sharing deeply personal and painful 
stories, through public comment 
sessions with investigators to news 
media and demonstrations, including 
the one on the Ann Arbor campus in 
front of my house. The Regents and 
I have heard them. We are listening 
intently and encourage any survivors 
to speak out.”

Following the Regents meeting, 

Vaughn held a conference call outside 
of Schlissel’s residence to respond 
to his comments, saying Schlissel 
has yet to speak directly with him 
or other survivors that had been 
camped outside his house for 13 days, 
as of the Oct. 21 Regents meeting.

“I’ve never heard (Schlissel) speak 

to any Anderson survivors,” Vaughn 
said. “I was standing 100 feet from 

him yesterday, I know he knew who 
I was because we were standing 
on the sidewalk as he was walking 
toward his house, and he never spoke 
a word.”

Vaughn 
also 
expressed 
his 

frustrations that Schlissel hasn’t 
introduced himself to Vaughn and 
other Anderson survivors.

“I’m not trying to resolve this case 

in an interaction with the President 
at his house. But, speak to me like 
a human being — that has never 
been done,” Vaughn said. “We’re 
always referred to as either John 
Does or victims. What would I like 
him to say? How about just ‘Hello’? 
Introduce yourself.”

Protesters outside President’s house frustrated with lack of acknowledgement

After dedicating much of his three 

years at the University of Michigan 
to telling his story and working 
in disability advocacy, LSA senior 
Vincent Pinti has been awarded this 
year’s James T. Neubacher Award, a 
recognition reserved for University 
affiliates. 

The 
award 
is 
named 
after 

Neubacher, a University alum and 
journalist for the Detroit Free Press, 
who wrote a nationally recognized 
column called “Disabled in Detroit” 
shortly after he was diagnosed with 
multiple sclerosis in 1979. 

Pinti is the first undergraduate 

to win in recent years and was 
awarded in recognition of his work 
through Central Student Government 
to improve the accessibility for 
students with disabilities on campus. 
Students at the University have long 
struggled to receive appropriate 
disability 
accommodations 
with 

their departments and Services for 
Students with Disabilities, claiming 
confusing 
and 
time-consuming 

processes that hindered their ability 
to receive accommodations.

After facing some challenges with 

accessibility and accommodations 
during his first year on campus, Pinti 

dedicated himself to ensuring no 
student with a disability has to suffer 
through what he did. Pinti said he 
has spinal-muscular atrophy, which 
means he uses a wheelchair and was 
born into what he called a “disabled 
world.”

“I’ve always felt the need to 

advocate because there are so many 
people that have disabilities,but for 
whatever reason might not be able to 
share their lived experience and might 
not be able to share the adversity that 
they have to go through to get the 
resources that they need,” Pinti said. 

The 
Neubacher 
Award 
is 

presented annually during Disability 
Community Month. The project 
Pinti is being recognized for is his 
work creating the Personal Assistant/
Personal Care Assistant (PA/PCA) 
scholarship program. 

PA/PCAs help people with chronic 

illness or disabilities meet their daily 
mental and physical health needs. 
This scholarship, sponsored by CSG, 
internally 
provides 
educational 

funding for students working in this 
field. Pinti said there is a dire need for 
people working in these positions due 
to understaffing in the field. 

“It’s 
hard 
work, 
oftentimes 

manual labor, and there’s not a lot of 
demand for it because they don’t get 
compensated very much at all from 
the state, so the students are going 

above and beyond by doing this,” Pinti 
said. “That’s why I decided to build 
this scholarship.” 

Pinti has also been involved 

in numerous other initiatives on 
campus, such as pushing for metal 
straws in the dining halls, ensuring 
environmental anti-plastic initiatives 
don’t impact disabled students on 
campus and helping design more 
accessible 
emergency 
procedures 

in campus buildings. He is also 
currently working on developing a 
PA/PCA database of student workers 
to address the caregiver shortage in 
Michigan. 

“Students can play a role in this, U 

of M can play a role in building this 
database,” Pinti said. “So I would just 
give a call to action that U of M needs 
to build the PCA database now.” 

Stephanie Rosen, chair of the 

Council of Disability Concerns, said 
the award honors those advocating on 
behalf of disabled individuals just as 
Neubacher did.

“He was an advocate for truth, 

access for himself, and for the broader 
disability communities,” Rosen said. 
“This award was named in his honor, 
as a memorial to his work and to 
recognize work that carries on that 
legacy.”

UMich researchers convert 
food waste into usable energy


Growing up, there was not 

a night that went by that my 
mom didn’t read to me before 
bed. It was a ritual. After my 
bath, I would choose a book or 
two (or three, depending on 
how fatigued my mom was) and 
crawl into her lap. My process 
of choosing the right books was 
anywhere from immediate to 
a whole production up until 
my mom threatened to cancel 
storytime altogether unless I 
decided quickly. I’d stand at my 
bookshelf, taking in the distinct 
smell of old wood and paper, and 
select our stories for the night. 
I generally gravitated to the 
same books over and over again, 
but one of the greatest joys of 
my childhood was trips to the 
library with my mom. It was 
here where my mom and I spent 
time exploring and traversing 
the shelves for our next story.

I spent a lot of time picking 

out the perfect books for the 
week ahead. There was one 
time when I was so engrossed 
by the selection of potential 
books that I ignored my bladder 
signaling to me it was time to 
go; I peed myself in the middle 
of the library just because I 
wanted to keep looking at the 
books. I thankfully had my mom 
standing close by to hand me 
her sweater and help me cover 
my new dark blue pants. As 
humiliating as that experience 
was at the time, my mom and I 
frequently laugh about it to this 
day in a shared remembrance of 
all of the memories we shared 
at the library. The library not 

only offered me quality time 
with my mom but also instilled 
in me a passion for reading that 
I continue to foster. Without the 
time I spent with my mom in the 
library and during storytime, 
I don’t know if I would be the 
reader I am today. Below is a 
short tour of some of my and my 
mom’s favorite books found in 
the library and on my shelves.

“Corduroy” 
by 
Don 

Freeman

I’ve always felt attached to 

this book, probably because 
I used to think my stuffed 
animals were alive. Maybe their 

perceived sentience was the 
result of growing up in the age 
of “Toy Story,” or maybe it was 
just because I’ve always had 
an overactive imagination, but 
I was never able to shake the 
feeling that my stuffed animals 
had their own wants and desires. 
Corduroy is a toy bear who wants 
to be taken home. When a girl’s 
mother realizes he is missing a 
button, she refuses to concede 
to her daughter in her desire 

to buy Corduroy. After this, 
Corduroy commits to finding his 
lost button to ensure that, next 
time, he is taken home. Though 
Corduroy fails to find a button, 
his friend from the day before 
comes back ready to purchase 
him 
with 
her 
own 
money. 

Corduroy gave me the one thing 
I’ve always loved in a story — an 
adorable underdog to fight for. 
The nights that my mom and I 
read this book, I always held my 
own toy bear a little tighter.

“Where Do Balloons Go? An 

Uplifting Mystery” by Jamie 
Lee Curtis

I love Jamie Lee Curtis, not 

only for her acting in my other 
childhood 
staple, 
“Freaky 

Friday,” but also for her superb 
ability to write a children’s book. 
When I was younger, I thought 
this book was genius. Everyone 
wants to know where balloons 
go, especially six-year-old me. 
I loved this book because I got 
to imagine with my mom all the 
places my lost balloons could be. 
Nothing was off-limits with this 

book: tangoing with airplanes, 
floating next to the sun or 
just laying down and relaxing. 
Another plus to this book (and 
maybe the main reason I kept 
coming back to it) was the 
reusable balloon stickers that 
came with it. Maybe all authors 
should include stickers in their 
books so that readers will 
remember the book, even years 
later. 

“Walter the Farting Dog” 

by William Kotzwinkle

When I start thinking about 

the books my mom and I used to 
read, this is the first book that 
comes to mind. Simultaneously 
a story about a thwarted home 
invasion attempt and a tale 
of 
unconditional 
love, 
this 

author definitely knows how 
to get his readers invested. 
Our protagonist, Walter, is a 
farting dog. His unrelenting 
toots smell putrid no matter 
what diet his family puts him 
on. The father is just about to 
send Walter back to the pound 
for his flatulence when Walter 
saves the family from burglars 
by letting out “the worst fart of 
his life,” which smells so bad 
that the thieves have to leave 
the house immediately without 
stealing a single thing. When 
I was younger, I remember 
thinking this book was the 
peak of comedy. I still don’t 
know if I’ve ever laughed as 
hard as when my mom and I 
first read this book. Perhaps 
it was because the author says 
the word “fart” so much, or 
maybe it was just because of 
the absurdity of the story itself, 
but I couldn’t get enough.

“Dear Lady Bird, when I 

got pregnant with you, it was a 
miracle.”

The letters that Marion (Laurie 

Metcalf, 
“Roseanne”) 
writes 

to her daughter are never read 
aloud. She never gives them to 
her because she is afraid that 
Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan, “Little 
Women”) will “judge her writing 
abilities.” Lady Bird only sees 
them because her father (Tracy 
Letts, “Ford v. Ferrari”) fishes 
them out of the garbage and 
sneaks them into her suitcase 
before she leaves for college. You 
have to pause the film to be able 
to read the crumpled letters. So 
much of the love in this film goes 
unspoken in hopes that it might 
hurt less.

“Lady Bird” is a coming-of-age 

story about Christine, who asks to 
be called Lady Bird, as she exits 
high school and grapples with 
her relationship with her mother. 
There’s no shortage of writing 
about this film out there, but I 
do sometimes feel that discourse 
about the film centers on Lady 
Bird as an individual rather than 
in relation to those around her. We 
see ourselves in her as a heroine 
taking on the world because that 
is what high school feels like. 
It’s hard to remember that our 
mothers once felt the same way.

Really, I think that Lady Bird is 

a 21st-century Holden Caulfield, 
and Greta Gerwig (“20th Century 
Women”) is our J.D. Salinger. 
Lady Bird is a bitter, mean, clever, 
funny, original conformist. We 
identify with her as much as we 
resent her. She wants to “live 

through something.” Ironically, 
she just witnessed 9/11 the year 
before, but the things that happen 
in our lives never seem as earth-
shattering as they do in books, do 
they? 

It’s the impetus of her first 

on-screen fight with her mother. 
Her mother, who was raised by 
an abusive, alcoholic mother, feels 
that Lady Bird has a “great life.” 
In a lot of ways, she does, but she’s 
not just looking for the bottom 
rows of Maslow’s hierarchy of 
needs. Lady Bird desperately, 
desperately wants an adventure. 
She feels that the real stories only 
happen in proximity to her: her 
theater director grieves for his 
son, her first boyfriend worries 
about coming out, her second 
boyfriend has a father dying of 
cancer. The problems in her life 
feel so small in comparison.

Gerwig does an incredible job 

of tricking us into thinking the 
same thing. A story about Lady 
Bird’s brother watching someone 
get stabbed is bracketed by the 
phrase “Immaculate Fart.” At 
the psychiatric ward where 
Marion works, a patient tries to 
hurt someone or themselves off-
screen. While Marion admits 
that it was scary, she simply says 
that they’ll have to go back to 
felt-tip markers and hands her 
coworker a gift for his newborn 
daughter. Lady Bird actually 
jumps out of a moving car on 
the highway, and Gerwig is able 
to make us laugh instead of cry 
about it. It feels like when you’re 
telling a story about your life at 
a party, and only when you say 
it out loud do you realize how 
fucked up it actually is. 

In 2012, my family went to see 

“Brave,” Pixar’s newest installment, 
in theaters while on a trip to Boston. 
I was 12 years old at the time, and my 
older sister was in high school; she 
and my mom had been fighting a lot, 
going through the classic teenage-
girl-versus-mother-tension. In the 
theater, everyone in my family had 
something different to enjoy. While 

I focused on the jokes, my mom and 
sister seemed to focus more on the 
heart of the story: the relationship 
between Merida (Kelly Macdonald, 
“No Country for Old Men”) and her 
mother Elinor (Emma Thompson, 
“Cruella”).

The film instantly sets up the 

differences between Merida and 
her mother. Merida, with her wild 
red hair, chafes at the way her life 
is planned out. Her freest moments 
are those when she is alone with her 
horse, her bow and the surrounding 
natural landscape; her most limited 
moments are those when her mother 
is preparing her to be the queen of her 
land by teaching the expectations of 
a princess, which Merida despises. 
On the other hand, Elinor is hesitant 
to let her daughter take paths that 
go beyond the tradition that she is 
used to. Elinor sees her lessons and 
the conditions that she imposes 

on Merida as ways to guarantee a 
secure future; Merida sees these as 
restrictions and therefore believes 
that her mother is the barrier 
between her and the future she 
wants for herself.

“Brave,” Pixar’s first film with 

a female protagonist, caught the 
attention of audiences with its 
incredibly detailed animation, strong 
Scottish brogue and the deliberate 
exclusion of a romantic subplot. This 
last aspect is not something to take 
lightly — Merida’s declaration of “I’ll 
be shootin’ for mah own hahnd” is 

a groundbreaking, not to mention 
iconic, departure from fairy tale 
tropes. In “Brave,” no one gets to 
win Merida’s hand without her own 
consent.

This becomes the boiling point 

of tensions between Merida, who 
values her freedom to the point of 
selfishness, and Elinor, who values 
tradition to the point that she ignores 
her daughter’s happiness. Words 
fly; a tapestry, meant to depict the 
bond of family, gets torn. Merida 
consults a witch (Julie Walters, 
“Mamma Mia!”) and gets a potion 
meant to “change” her mother — 
specifically her entrenched beliefs 
— and inadvertently turns her into a 
bear. It’s an extreme beginning to a 
reconciliation, but it effectively forces 
them into a position where they have 
to listen to and learn from each other.

One of the things I love most about 

“Brave” is that the female characters 

and relationships are not diminished. 
Elinor and Merida’s quiet conflict, 
while taking on an admittedly 
oversized obstacle (i.e., transforming 
into 
a 
bear), 
is 
sophisticated 

and complex compared to the 
cartoonishly overdone masculinity 
of the clansmen. Additionally, both 
Elinor and Merida carry incredible 
power. When they walk through 
the room, the men stop fighting and 
create a path; when they speak, people 
listen. The clashes between them are 
not characterized as “catfights” or 
stupid conflicts based in jealousy. 
When they fight, it’s because they are 
both independent and strong; when 
they make up, it’s because there is 
still room in the world (and the film) 
for two incredibly powerful women 
to be on the same side.

The 
transformation 
of 
their 

relationship 
is 
admittedly 

predictable, 
filled 
with 
easy 

metaphors 
about 
ruptures 
and 

healing, but the intensity of the 
emotion is what gives it so much 
power. A scene where Elinor and 
Merida talk to their respective 
sounding boards — Elinor’s husband 
Fergus 
(Billy 
Connolly, 
“The 

Boondock Saints”) and Merida’s 
horse Angus — moves back and forth 
between them as they express their 
free-flowing feelings, demonstrating 
how the biggest problem between the 
two of them, like most relationships, 
is a lack of simple communication. 
As Merida’s gotten older, they’ve 
stopped rationally explaining their 
hopes for fear of clashing, and they’ve 
lost their ability to convey their 
affection for each other. These rifts 
are contrasted with moments from 
Merida’s childhood — one shown 
at the beginning of the film and 
one shown as things become more 
dire — that show scenes of affection 
between mother and daughter. 
Merida and Elinor hug each other 
and look at each other with love as 
if to show that their foundation is 
unshakable, even when it feels as 
though it’s being shaken.

I’ve always been deemed a bit of a 
momma’s child. 
Grabbing your hand or hiding 
behind your leg, a scared child. 
I knew I was safe from everything.
The boring world of math. The 
dangers of human society. 
Having crust on my sandwiches.
The only thing I wasn’t safe from
Was growing up.
So I did.
Because I had to.
I had to be a part of this family.
We joke that I look like no one in the 
family —
Me, the wrong baby taken home 
from a British hospital —
But secretly, 
If I can say this honestly
I was always glad I looked most like 
you. 
One of your three kids had to.
It’s an honor that it’s me.
Because I get to. 
I get to do these amazing things,
These many amazing things
That not everyone has the chance 
to do.
Like attend a prestigious university,
Like tell stories for people who 
want to listen,
Like care deeply for my friends and 
family,
Things I strive to not take for 
granted every day.
Because I have your support.
I have your support more like a best 
friend than a mother,
A friend who loves and listens with 
the fervor and wisdom of a mother.
It cannot be easy, I know
Seeing your child, the youngest of 
the flock, 
Turning 22.
Ready to graduate college.
Ready to move on and up and out.
To fly out of the nest and seek their 
own destiny.
To define their own identity.
Because I am expected to.
I am expected to be okay with the 
marching of time,

The 
endless 
and 
unstoppable 

forward momentum of time.
It is not easy, you know,
That your child, the youngest of the 
flock,
Has turned 22.
They are not ready to graduate 
college.
They are not ready to move on or up.
They are certainly not ready to 
move out.
To seek their own destiny.
To define their own identity.
Because life is a lot scarier without 
your leg to hide behind.
Without your leg to hide behind, 
the shadows of adulthood look 
much scarier.
Even when a light shines on them 
and they go away, they are much 
scarier.
Facing 
them 
alone, 
venturing 

through the woods
In the way a child must
Once they stop being viewed as 
merely a child.
You can only pave the road so far,
Until I take your place.
Because I am expected to stand on 
my own.
To stand on my own, with you on 
the sidelines,
Passionately cheering me on and 
providing orange slices.
My number one supporter and 
biggest fan,

Reading articles about a digital 
world you don’t always get. 
My cheerleader dancing to Marcia 
Ball,
Although it was never actually 
Marcia Ball playing.
But you’d dance anyway and ask me 
to join you.
And I would groan and giggle and 
roll my eyes,
But I would join you anyway.
Because I would not be who I am 
without you.
Without you, I would not have my 
passion for music.
Because you created a place for me 
and others to practice it.
Or my passion for reading.
Because you would buy me books 
when I sped through them in a day.
For love. For helping. For listening. 
Because you care so much about 
others, 
Putting the needs of those we love 
at the forefront of our minds,
An endless well of love.
For crabs. For musicals.
Because there is no greater joy than 
you digging into a crab the same 
way 
one digs into a great piece of art. 
For my family.
Because without you, we would not 
know who to be.

Mothers, daughters and bears, oh my
A mother’s child

Forgiving our mothers 

through ‘Lady Bird’

Farting fairy tales and other stories from my mom

KARI ANDERSON

Senior Arts Editor

There is no simple answer to the 

question “What is motherhood?”. 
Many of us think of mothers as 
the figures who have supported us 
our whole lives, from reading us 
books as children to cheering us 
on as adults, through triumphs and 
setbacks. This B-Side makes sure to 
pay tribute to this sacredness. But in 

media, popular culture and life, all 
sorts of moms exist. Some are overtly 
disappointing, while others may get 
away with too much. Some must 
balance conventional motherhood 
with nurturing their work. Some 
fall victim to the ever-growing lens 
of female sexualization that gets 
aimed indiscriminately. But each is 
still a mom. Don’t see what I mean? 
These pieces say it better than I can.

It’s hard to pin down where I 

nurtured my love for art because 
it’s as though it has been in my 
blood since I was born. I grew 
up hearing “We’ll be back late 
tonight, it’s opening night at the 
gallery,” and the endless phone 
calls my father would get from 
international clients in languages 

I couldn’t comprehend at the time. 
Many of the things my parents did 
made no sense to me, but they 
felt like premonitions of what my 
future held; they felt right. 

My parents were the foundation 

of that passion, but the turning 
point became learning about 
Peggy Guggenheim — one of the 
most fascinating women to have 
walked this earth, in my humble 
opinion. 

I discovered her spontaneously 

when wandering around Venice, in 
the summer before my freshman 
year of college. When I walked 
into 
the 
Peggy 
Guggenheim 

Collection, I instantly recognized 
a Picasso painting to my right, in 
front of me a hanging Calder, to 
my left a Magritte. In the far back 
I could see a Jean Arp, a Pollock 
and a Dalí … it seemed that every 
important modernist artist was 
there, present, in the room. 

She had lived within those 

walls, and every work in sight 
had been hers. Before I left 
the 
museum, 
I 
bought 
her 

autobiography 
“Out 
of 
This 

Century: Confessions of an Art 
Addict” and embarked on a 
journey of becoming someone I 
never knew I could be. And though 
I discovered her rather late, life 
ever since has been a bit more 
exciting — as though she could 
make all dull things shine, and all 
far dreams seem attainable.

Guggenheim was born into 

the wealthy New York City 
Guggenheim family, destined for 
a life of ostentatious riches and 

pretentious people. Her father 
died in the Titanic tragedy in 1912; 
she was left with her mother and 
her two sisters, Hazel and Benita. 
Death and dissociation became 
the pillars of her youth, and she 
was always regarded as the “black 
sheep” of the Guggenheims. 

She 
married 
the 
writer 

Laurence Vail and had two 
children: Sindbad and Pegeen. 
Their problematic marriage led 
to an unfair divorce in which her 
kids were separated — Sindbad 
went away with Laurence, and 
she kept Pegeen. In her memoir, 
she mentions having felt like she 
had nothing in common with 
Sinbad other than their physical 
resemblance. Pegeen, on the other 
hand, was the “love of her life” — 
they were close and adored each 
other, but no matter how hard 
she tried, Guggenheim felt she 
didn’t know how to be a mother to 
Pegeen.

They led awfully similar lives, 

so much so that it was Pegeen’s 
own problematic marriage that led 
her to suicide at age 41. Wrecked 

motherhoods didn’t cease either. 
Peggy’s sister Benita died in 
childbirth, and both of Hazel’s 
sons “fell off” of the Surrey Hotel 
rooftop — speculation has it that 
she dropped them because she’d 
rather them dead than with their 
father, with whom she was in the 
middle of a divorce. Tragedy after 
tragedy. Kafkaesque, almost. 

Actually, it was thanks to her 

own mother’s death and the 
$450,000 fortune left to her 
name that she could open her first 
gallery, “Guggenheim Jeune,” in 
London in 1938. With the war, she 
was forced to leave London and 
move to New York City. In 1939, 
artists were desperate to sell art, 
and at one point, Guggenheim 
was buying one painting a day 
for ridiculously low prices — in 
her memoir, she recalls having 
bought a Dalí while in bed. In 
addition to buying, she also urged 
artists to leave Europe and move 
to the United States. In 1942, she 
opened her second gallery, “Art 
of this Century,” and with this 
opening, Guggenheim came to be 
the bridge between European and 
American art, between surrealism 
and abstract expressionism. The 
link between masterminds like 
Picasso, Miró and Giacometti 
and Paul Klee, Mark Rothko 
and Clyfford Still, her newfound 
jewels. She saw herself as “the 
midwife” of the American avant-
garde, having given many of the 
big names of modern art their first 
solo exhibition. 

Perhaps her most incredible 

work as a matron was the 
discovery of Jackson Pollock, who 
was working as a maintenance 
man in his uncle’s museum, the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim of New 
York (then the Museum of Non-
Objective Painting), at the time 
of their first encounter. She saw 
potential and invested, as she 
had done previously with several 
other artists. She “made him.” 
Guggenheim 
commissioned 

Pollock to create a mural that 
would go on the outside wall of 
her house in the city; to this day 
it’s the artist’s largest work. 

With fall in full swing, I thought 

it was appropriate to return to one 
of my favorite seasonal hobbies: 
rewatching “Gilmore Girls” for 
the millionth time. I can’t help 
it. I first saw the entire series in 
high school, and I immediately 
fell in love with it. Even though I 
now know every single thing that 
happens, there’s something about 
the small-town aesthetics and 
quirky characters that keeps me 
coming back. It’s the after-school 
special in my house: My mom, 
sisters and I go straight from the 
car to the couch, make a big bowl 
of popcorn and turn on our next 
episode.

But something changed during 

this latest rewatch. Maybe it’s 
because I’m a little older now, or 

maybe it’s because I’m watching 
the show with my own mom, but 
either way I have come to a very 
sad conclusion: Lorelai Gilmore 
kind of sucks.

I know what you’re thinking. 

How can a show’s main character 
be so bad? Let me just say that I still 
like the character. Lauren Graham 
is a great actress, and Lorelai 
still has plenty of endearing 
qualities. But it’s her flaws that 
make her unbearable at times 
(spoilers abound). Whether it’s 
her relationships with her family, 
friends or romantic partners, 
Lorelai is not the greatest. 

She doesn’t like that Rory 

has a better relationship with 
Richard and Emily than she 
does. (S1 E1, E3; S3 E8, E9)

Much of the conflict set up 

in the show surrounds Lorelai’s 
rocky 
relationship 
with 
her 

parents. When she gets pregnant 

at sixteen, she runs away from 
Richard 
and 
Emily’s 
elitist 

lifestyle to raise her daughter, 
Rory, herself. The only reason she 
goes back is to ask for money to 
cover Rory’s high school tuition 
— where the show begins. Emily, 
Lorelai’s mother, only agrees to 
loan her the money in exchange 
for regular contact with her and 
Rory. Lorelai’s dislike of the idea 
stems from her pride, which 
unfortunately sets a precedent for 
much of her behavior throughout 
the show.

Given that she had to make 

a new life for herself, it makes 
sense that she wants Rory to have 
more opportunities … unless they 
involve the elitist lifestyle of her 
parents. Anytime she sees Rory 
getting drawn to the lifestyle she 
herself detested, it results in some 
sort of petty fight. Richard and 
Emily are by no means perfect, but 

they just don’t want to see their 
daughter leave again. What Rory 
wants to do with her life should be 
her own decision, and to her credit, 
Lorelai does admit this eventually. 
But watching the constant back 
and forth between Lorelai and her 
parents gets exhausting over the 
show’s seven-season run.

She’s a terrible friend to 

Sookie. (S4 E14; S6 E4)

Lorelai and Sookie spend the 

show’s first few seasons dreaming 
of opening an inn together. When 
they finally achieve that dream 
and Sookie misses an important 
meeting, Lorelai chews her out 
over not pulling her weight. 
Opening any new business is 
stressful, but so is having a 
newborn baby — and Sookie just 
had her first. She feels really bad 
about missing the meeting but is 
clearly exhausted, and instead 
of being understanding, Lorelai 

implies that Sookie should be 
focusing more on the inn since it’s 
more important. We never see her 
apologize, and it isn’t brought up 
again.

A couple of seasons later, 

Lorelai 
epitomizes 
the 
one-

sidedness of their friendship even 
more. Sookie asks Lorelai and 
Rory to be the godmothers to her 
children in an attempt to resolve a 
tiff between the mother-daughter 
pair. But instead, Lorelai causes a 
fight in the middle of the baptism. 
She and Rory are literally holding 
the babies while they argue. It’s 
completely disrespectful to Sookie 
and her entire family. I’m amazed 
that Sookie excuses so much of her 
behavior.

She treats Rory more like a 

friend than a daughter. (S5 E1)

Since Lorelai gave birth to 

Rory at such a young age, they 
have grown up together and are 
understandably a lot closer than 
other mothers and daughters. 
But whenever they fight, Lorelai 
continuously cuts Rory out instead 
of disciplining her or at least 
having a mature conversation. 
Lorelai only pulls the “mom card” 
in special circumstances, usually 
when she doesn’t want to talk 
about something. Rory screwed 
up big time when she slept with 
a married man (pun intended). 
But when she doesn’t want to 
talk about it, Lorelai freezes her 
out, stooping to the petty level of 
her 19-year-old. This is just one 
example of Lorelai initially being 

the voice of reason, but behaving 
poorly when things don’t go her 
way.

She doesn’t respect Rory’s 

boyfriends. (S2 E5; S2 E19; S5 
E19, E20)

Okay, Jess didn’t leave the best 

first impression. But keep in mind 
that when he first meets Lorelai, 
he’s just moved to their town, 
Stars Hollow, against his will. Add 
that to the fact that he comes from 
a troubled family, and his reaction 
makes a little more sense. But even 
after Rory asks Lorelai to give 
him the benefit of the doubt, she 
doesn’t put in that much effort. 
And whenever something goes 
wrong when Rory and Jess are 
both at fault, Lorelai immediately 
blames Jess and even Luke, her 
friend and Jess’s uncle, for pushing 
them together. 

Her next boyfriend, Logan 

Huntzberger, treats Rory much 
better than Jess, but Lorelai takes 
a long time to warm up to him as 
well. His family runs in the same 
circles as Richard and Emily, 
and 
the 
other 
Huntzbergers 

don’t treat Rory well at all. This 
perfectly explains why Lorelai 
acts cold around Logan at first, 
even though he’s a good match 
for Rory and their relationship 
is relatively stable for the rest of 
the series. Looping Logan in with 
the rest of his family isn’t fair, 
which Lorelai of all people should 
understand.

Stacey’s Mom has got it goin’ 

on — or at least, the animated 
moms of Pixar do. Since the 1995 
premiere of “Toy Story,” the 
world’s first animated film made 
using computer technology, Pixar 
has become a household name. 
The studio is best known for its 
animated children’s films, from 
“Finding Nemo” to their most 
recent release, “Luca.” The name 
Pixar has long been synonymous 
with childhood — and now?

Pixar’s 
“The 
Incredibles”: 

Children recall the slapstick humor 
of Mr. Incredible; parents fondly 
note the hidden, wry comedy that 
made the film a multi-generational 
hit. For others, it’s the firm, round 
backside 
of 
Mrs. 
Incredible’s 

peachy-keen cheeks; the tight 
elastic of a super-suit that clings 
like saran-wrap around her wide, 
womanly hips; the perkiness of 
a bum, the audacity of an ass, 
the perfection of a pear figure — 
aged by 40 years like a bottle of 
something fine. That’s right, Mrs. 
Incredible is a MILF. Sorry, not 
sorry. 

Shocking, I know. Some readers 

may even be turning away in thinly 
veiled disgust. How dare we sour 
the sanctity of a Pixar film with 
softcore erotica written in fervent 
devotion 
to 
Mrs. 
Incredible’s 

poppin’ figure? We dare in the spirit 
of journalistic integrity, a devotion 
to seeking the truth. Because 
we aren’t the first to call Mrs. 
Incredible a MILF — that dubious 
glory belongs to the Internet and 
the horny little shits who live there. 

The 
MILFs: 
Who, 
What, 

Where

But first, what exactly is a MILF? 

As Urban Dictionary describes it, a 
MILF is a “Mom I’d Like to Fuck, 
or Mature I’d Like to Fuck.” MILFs 
usually apply to “hot moms,” but 
the term is liberally applied to any 
woman above the age of thirty. 
The MILF obsession is no niche 
Internet kink found in the recesses 
of Reddit but an ever-growing 

phenomenon found across adult 
films, platforms like Instagram 
and even dating apps. According to 
a 2016 survey by the adult website 
GameLink.com, “interest in MILF 
porn has risen 83%” between 2012 
and 2016. This trend has continued 
to grow in prevalence since.

Many consider the 1999 cult 

classic film “American Pie” to 
have launched the modern MILF 
obsession. The raunchy comedy 
follows a group of teenage boys 

competing to lose their virginity 
by their high school prom. In the 
film, actress Jennifer Coolidge 
(“White Lotus”) has sex with 
her son’s friend — the true MILF 
fantasy. However, it is important 
to offer credit where credit is due 
to 1965 classic “The Graduate,” 
where actor Dustin Hoffman 
(“Rain Man”) is seduced by a 
beautiful, neglected housewife: 
Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft, 
“The Miracle Worker”). In 2003, 
Fountains 
of 
Wayne 
released 

their iconic hit “Stacy’s Mom,” a 
serenade to Stacy’s (supposedly) 
hot mom. As adult film star Tanya 
Tate remarked in a 2014 interview 
with Thrillist, “there are plenty 
of guys out there who really had 
crushes on their Mom’s friends (as 
teenagers).”

In fact, the target age group for 

MILF content on adult websites is 
between the ages of 18 and 25; this 
age range lands neatly between 
the naivety of adolescence and 
the “wisdom” of adulthood. It 
also correlates with the widely 
accepted peak period of horniness.

The classic MILF lover is a 

not-yet man who washes his 
sheets 
every 
three 
months 

(optimistically), shotguns Natty 
Lights and advertises “MILFs 
only, seriously” on his dating 
profile. He believes women his 
age are “crazy,” “clingy” and far 
too sexually inexperienced to 
possibly please him. He longs for 
an older woman who promises a 
brief, scalding affair of “no crap,” 
who will usher him into manhood 

through the power of her perky, 
never sagging triple-Ds and lust 
for a barely-pubescent, skinny, 
frat pledge’s medium-firm abs. It 
is this dazzling specimen of raw 
masculinity that drives the MILF-
ication of Pixar moms. 

The Evolution of the Pixar 

MILF and Evolving Beauty 
Standards

Pixar 
MILFs 
walk 
a 
fine 

line between the celebration of 
motherhood and pandering to 
societal beauty trends. On one 
hand, moms can be and are hot. 
Our critique of MILF culture is in 
no way a rejection of hot moms. 
Moms deserve to embrace their 
femininity 
and 
womanhood, 

to embrace themselves, to be a 
woman as well as a mom. On 
the other hand, in consideration 
of evolving beauty trends over 
the last twenty years, there is an 
undeniable parallel between the 
developing animation of Pixar 
moms to emphasize curves and 
contemporary beauty standards.

L

ast year, former Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg died, and the 

Democrats’ 
nightmare 
ensued. 

A month later, former President 
Donald Trump nominated Justice 
Amy Coney Barrett — an anti-
abortion advocate — to replace 
Ginsburg, a liberal and feminist icon. 
The Republican-controlled Senate 
confirmed this nomination.

Ginsburg refrained from retiring 

during former President Barack 
Obama’s second term, which allowed 
Trump to appoint her successor. As 
the oldest current member of the 
Supreme Court, Associate Justice 
Stephen Breyer should learn from 
Ginsburg’s mistake. He should retire 
now to guarantee that he will be 
replaced by a liberal justice. 

While 
Democrats 
currently 

control Congress and the presidency, it 
is possible that the midterm elections 
next year could hand the Senate to 
Republicans, giving them the upper 
hand on all votes, including those to 
confirm Supreme Court nominees. 
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has 
already confirmed it would be “highly 
unlikely” that Republicans would 
vote to confirm a Biden Supreme 
Court nominee should they take 
back the Senate. While Breyer does 
not appear to have significant health 
issues, he is 83 years old. Ginsburg 
died when she was 87, four years after 
Obama’s presidency ended. 

The question of Breyer’s retirement 

is on the minds of liberals, including 
Breyer himself. In response to calls 
for him to step down, Breyer has said 
that he will retire on his own terms. 
He has offered explanations for his 
refusal to provide a clear timeline, 

including worries that it will increase 
polarization, a consistent theme from 
him. Breyer argued that “if the public 
sees judges as politicians in robes, its 
confidence in the courts, and in the 
rule of law itself, can only diminish, 
diminishing the court’s power.”

While it is honorable that Breyer 

cares about preserving the integrity 
of the Supreme Court and American 
institutions, this strategy doesn’t 
work when the other side refuses to 
reciprocate. 

On election night in 2000, the 

Wall Street Journal reported that 
then-Justice Sandra Day O’Connor 
“would be reluctant to retire if a 
Democrat were in the White House 
and would choose her replacement.” 
O’Connor retired in 2005, with 
former President George W. Bush 
selecting her replacement. Former 
Justice Anthony Kennedy chose to 
retire in 2018 after Trump developed 
a relationship with Kennedy to 
ensure that he trusted Trump to 
choose the right person to replace 
him. Both O’Connor and Kennedy 
are still alive today.

Liberal justices have illustrated 

how retiring honorably, or on one’s 
own terms, allows conservative 
justices to remake the Supreme 
Court. Ginsburg’s death last year, and 
the aftermath illustrated the damage 
these decisions can cause. In 1991, 
former Justice Thurgood Marshall 
chose to retire during the George 
H.W. Bush administration for reasons 
related to his health. Bush replaced 
him with Justice Clarence Thomas, 
who is still on the bench today and 
is one of the most conservative 
justices on the Supreme Court. It 
is understandable why Marshall 
retired when he did, and he certainly 
deserved that retirement. But, it 
is undeniable that his retirement 
dramatically changed the makeup of 

the Supreme Court for at least the past 
30 years, and likely more. 

While the Supreme Court should, 

in theory, avoid party politics and 
focus on delivering decisions that 
follow the law and the Constitution, 
it has become clear in recent years 
that the Supreme Court, along with 
the entire American judicial system, 
has become much more politicized. 
Ending the filibuster on all judicial 
nominations and McConnell’s lack 
of action to replace former Justice 
Antonin Scalia in 2016 has made the 
Supreme Court a political branch 
of both parties. Breyer should 
understand that his refusal to retire 
is not a principled stance against the 
polarization of this country. Rather, it 
is an idealistic mistake that could give 
conservatives an even stronger hold 
on the Supreme Court, enabling the 
Court to make decisions that harm 
Americans. 

The current Supreme Court 

has already shown its ability to 
make consequential decisions that 
dramatically harm people’s lives. Its 
lack of action on the Texas abortion 
law illustrates why we need liberal 
justices on the Supreme Court. 
Besides this decision, the Supreme 
Court’s upcoming term includes 
cases that challenge Roe v. Wade, 
gun laws and the role of religion in 
schools. These are all issues that 
could change American life, and 
more significant decisions are sure to 
be heard in the coming years. 

The 
Supreme 
Court’s 
6-3 

conservative majority means that the 
loss of another liberal justice would 
lead to conservative domination for 
years to come. The only way to ensure 
that Breyer will be replaced by a 
liberal justice is for him to step down 
before the 2022 midterm elections 
and allow Biden and the Democratic 
Senate to choose his replacement. 

R

iding the “Korean Wave,” 
the survival, dystopian 
K-drama “Squid Game” 

has risen to No.1 on Netflix 
in the United States. It’s no 
surprise that this has happened. 
Korean pop culture has not only 
overtaken the US, but the globe. 
The success of BTS and fervent 
Twitter threads between K-Pop 
stans evinces this. But there 
is a deeper reason why “Squid 
Game” has gained popularity 
in such little time. Gen Z — 
the generation born roughly 
between 1996 and 2010 — 
has an affinity for dystopian 
fiction. This is the generation 
that was raised on “The Hunger 
Games,” 
“Divergent” 
and 

“Maze Runner” in their tween 
years. 
Anti-utopian 
fiction 

is as integral as Disney in 
Generation Z childhood media. 

Unsurprisingly, a generation 

raised 
on 
dystopianism 
is 

going to have fired-up political 
motives. The United States has 
become more like Panem, the 
fictional nation at the center 
of “The Hunger Games,” with 
power and wealth ever more 
consolidating in the hands of 
the few. This has culminated in 
a politically active, extremely 
vocal generation. Being digital 
natives has only propelled this 
further. We, as Gen Z, need to 
harness this political energy to 
make impactful changes to our 
politics at all levels. 

The world in which Gen Z has 

been thrust into is alarming. 
The climate crisis is upon us 
with its effects becoming more 
apparent. 
Temperatures 
are 

rising. Natural disasters are 
becoming more extreme. Food 
and water insecurity is and 
will be dire. Socially, wealth 
disparity is increasing. The 
consolidation of wealth in the 

US is returning to 1920s levels. 
The richest Americans’ wealth 
increased dramatically during 
2020 while the rest of the 
country faced a recession. Are 
these descriptions of Panem or 
of the United States? The line 
is eerily blurred. The premises 
of our childhood dystopian 
fiction mirror the social strife 
in the United States. We aren’t 
an apocalyptic state yet, but 
the signs don’t bode well for 
the future. The inequalities in 
the real world that formed the 
basis of early 2010s dystopian 
media have become exacerbated 
and do not seem to be abating in 
the near future unless systemic 
change fueled by public outcry 
takes place.

The teens and young adults 

of the globe do not back down 
in the political arena. The 
political strategies employed 
by this group resemble much 
of the rebellious efforts of 
our 
dystopian 
protagonists, 

albeit less physically violent 
in execution. Gen Z is highly 
supportive of political protest 
with a recent Politico poll 
reporting 
that 
63% 
of 
the 

generation supports protesting, 
much of which is in regard to the 
2020 protests in the name of the 
Black Lives Matter movement. 
What’s even more interesting 
is that Gen Z views protesting 
as more effective than voting to 
influence politics. This portion 
of the electorate is disenchanted 
with the political status quo. The 
protests against the military 
coup in Myanmar saw protesters 
use the iconic “Hunger Games” 
three-finger salute. A related 
political action that highlights 
Gen Z’s digital aptitude was 
when K-pop stans rallied online 
to troll former President Donald 
Trump by registering for his 
rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma despite 
never intending to attend. This 
prompted Trump to tout his 
popularity and then look quite 

foolish. There is a global feeling 
that the politics of the time are 
veering toward crisis and people 
are acting out in accordance.

Our generation has a certain 

je ne sais quoi. We have a fire 
under our asses lit by the 
need to fix the socio-political 
problems 
that 
are 
pushing 

our country to the precipice. 
And it’s no shocker to me that 
our political strategies show 
continuity with those modeled 
for us by the dystopian novels 
and films of our youth. We 
need to funnel this energy 
into intense political activism. 
Let us not be tempered in our 
political 
outrage. 
We 
have 

mass communication platforms 
at our disposal to unify and 
mobilize. We are one of the 
first generations to be able to 
usurp traditional information 
networks in order to make an 
impact on politics. To bed with 
only working within the system 
to change the system. If there 
is anything that our dystopian 
media has taught us, it’s that 
protest and working outside of 
the system can be an impactful 
form of political engagement. 

Gen Z clings to themes of 

dystopianism because we can 
easily relate them to our own 
experiences. 
The 
rich 
are 

getting richer at the expense 
of the lower class. The climate 
is being destroyed by the few 
to the detriment of all. These 
aren’t plot points in a fantasy 
novel. As we start to burgeon 
into the political scene, we 
need to utilize this intense 
zeal that we have to enact 
social 
change. 
The 
world 

seems to be crumbling, but 
we have the tools to fix it. I’m 
glad to have been raised on 
dystopianism. It’s imbued me 
with a responsibility to engage 
in political activism. I implore 
that more of Gen Z leans into 
this cultural current. It’s one of 
our greatest strengths.

ark 
Zuckerberg 

wants 
Facebook 
to 

become a “metaverse 

company.” In August, Facebook 
launched Horizon Workrooms, 
an application where users can 
strap on Facebook’s Oculus VR 
headset and attend 3D virtual 
meetings as their personalized 
avatar. Although Zuckerberg’s first 
foray into immersive tech might 
be clunky right now, his belief in 
the future of the metaverse is not 
as far-fetched as it might sound. 
Other Big Tech leaders such as 
Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney and 
Microsoft are talking about the 
metaverse as a very real possibility 
in the near future. 

So, what is the metaverse? 

Nobody knows exactly, but there 
is a lengthy body of work on 
the subject written by venture 
capitalist Matthew Ball. For 
those unwilling to dig through 
Ball’s website, works of science-
fiction, like Ernest Cline’s “Ready 
Player One” or the “San Junipero” 
episode from Netflix’s Black 
Mirror present captivating ideas 
of how the metaverse might turn 
out to mesh with our day-to-day 
lives. Imagine finishing a meeting 
on Workrooms at 3 p.m. on a 
Wednesday and then instantly 
transporting yourself to a virtual 
shopping mall, where you spend 
hours looking for a pair of cute 
new bell-bottoms. The metaverse 
is the overarching structure that 
binds each space together into a 
cohesive, navigable whole. It is no 
surprise that Zuckerberg wants 
an early stake in the metaverse. 
The earlier Facebook can build 
the most popular platform on 
the metaverse, the more profit 

they can rake in from advertisers. 
If the amount of personal data 
Facebook collects now is cause for 
alarm, imagine the possibilities 
for marketing firms once they 
have access to every word we say, 
every gesture we make and every 
place we visit in the virtual world. 

At this point, the metaverse 

should sound like the worst 
dystopia imaginable. In essence, it 
is a digital universe designed and 
controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, 
in which advertisers can exploit 
the field of neuroscience for even 
greater profits than they already 
are. Why are we not turning 
our backs and running away 
screaming?

We love social media, and at 

the same time recognize how 
detrimental it is to our mental 
health. It seems impossible to 
extricate ourselves from our 
online social networks, from 
fear of being left out and falling 
behind. Once someone comes up 
with a successful social platform 
on the metaverse, a similar 
network effect will occur, driving 
greater numbers of people to 
spend time on the newest fad 
provided by the market. 

Assuming, 
then, 
that 
the 

metaverse (with all its attendant 
problems) 
is 
inevitable, 
the 

question becomes how should we 
respond? Already, there are voices 
in the tech industry thinking 
of innovative ways to deal with 
the potential ethical dilemmas 
brought up in deciding how to 
write algorithms. Should our 
technology filter how we view the 
real world? Will the metaverse 
give 
computer 
engineers 
an 

unbearable burden of decision-
making? How will living in a 
manufactured 
world 
impact 

how we expose our children to 
the world? It is good to know 

that current professionals are 
seriously considering the social 
implications of their work, but it 
is not enough. 

Here at the University of 

Michigan, 
we 
have 
a 
rich 

tradition 
of 
excellence 
in 

technological innovation. Our 
computer science, engineering 
and various other technology-
oriented departments produce 
successful, 
industry-leading 

graduates 
that 
go 
on 
to 

accomplish great feats in their 
respective careers. Larry Page 
is perhaps the most notable 
example, but he is certainly 
not alone. Back in the 1980s, 
U-M 
Professor 
Emeritus 

Doug Van Houweling led a 
project to rebuild a National 
Science 
Foundation 
network 

of 
computers 
that 
arguably 

invented the internet. We truly 
are the Leaders and Best.

Now, if we are to live up to 

our school’s reputation, then we 
ought to direct our professional 
efforts toward leading the path 
forward 
for 
the 
metaverse. 

Computer 
science 
graduates 

should think in great detail 
about the impacts caused by the 
code they write and advocate for 
positive, helpful developments 
in 
our 
technology. 
Business 

students should invest in and 
found metaverse companies that 
aim to improve the social welfare 
of their consumers, even if that 
cuts into their profits. Political 
science students should advocate 
for changes in government tech 
policy that best reflect their 
values and work towards the 
future they wish to live in. We 
have an opportunity to build 
the metaverse into something 
beautiful, and a responsibility 
to make it as beneficial for the 
public good as we can.

I

t all happened so quickly. Since 
April 1, 2021, when I finally 
committed to my university 

of choice, every time I was asked 
about my plans after high school, I 
followed proudly with, “I’m going to 
the University of Michigan.” Even 
though I must have repeated that 
response a million times, it doesn’t 
feel real to be here in Ann Arbor. It 
was more of an automatic reply, but 
now I walk through the Law Quad, 
the Diag and down Main Street and 
it feels like I’ve been transported to a 
new life. A common phrase circling 
the internet (and campus) right now 
among first-year students describes 
the stunning realization “when you 
commit to a top university and it’s 
actually hard.” It is no longer just 
a response or something to put in 
your Instagram bio. It never felt 
like the moment was ever going to 
come. Time felt extended 100 times 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We 
anxiously sat and waited for over a 
year for the change and excitement 
that comes with being on campus. 
Thinking forward to life in college 
was a form of coping with social 
isolation and depression.

The Wall Street Journal recently 

ranked the University of Michigan 
as the No. 1 public university in the 
United States and No. 24 overall 
among public and private universities. 
According to the National Center 
for Education Statistics, their most 
recent data from 2018-2019 indicates 
that there are 2,828 four-year colleges 
in the U.S. 24th out of 2,828 is a mind-
boggling statistic to think about. This 
data illustrates that you are the cream 
of the crop as a student at U-M when 
it comes to higher education. 

The Wall Street Journal analyzes 

and creates these rankings based 
on several factors. While rankings 
from different sources vary due to 
utilizing different resources and 
criteria, the Wall Street Journal 
adequately analyzed and included 
all the characteristics I investigated 
while researching universities for my 
college applications. 

According to the Journal, “The 

WSJ/THE rankings are based on 15 
factors across four main categories: 
Forty percent of each school’s overall 
score comes from student outcomes, 
including graduates’ salaries and 
debt; 30% comes from academic 
resources, including how much the 

college spends on teaching; 20% 
from student engagement, including 
whether students feel prepared to use 
their education in the real world, and 
10% from the learning environment, 
including the diversity of the student 
body and academic staff.” While 
the standards the University sets as 
the top public school in the nation 
are impressive, they can also create 
an intimidating environment for 
students.

As we power through midterm 

season and calendars begin to fill 
with club meetings, deadlines, office 
hours and appointments, it is really 
easy to feel overwhelmed as a student 
at a university with such a rigorous 
curriculum. One after the other, 
new tasks pop up on the to-do list; 
it’s like running on a hamster wheel. 
Even though you feel you are pushing 
yourself above and beyond, so is 
everyone else. Every day I leave my 
residence hall at 9 a.m. and return at 5 
p.m., only to head out once again and 
finally end my day after midnight. 
Yet, it still never feels like enough. 
Everyone around you appears to 
be doing twice as much and having 
twice as much fun during their free 
time. Maybe prior to college, you may 
have been the one who took the most 
challenging 
classes, 
participated 

actively in every club and held 
a leadership position in every 
organization. It never felt like an 
option to be an average member. But 
now, you are constantly surrounded 
by students who are the exact same. It 
is easy to feel the pressure to perform 
at 100% all the time and live up to this 
standard. Now, who rises to the top? 

The Harvard Business Review 

defines 
imposter 
syndrome 

as “a collection of feelings of 
inadequacy that persist despite 
evident success.” The concept of 
imposter syndrome is ingrained 
in our brains at this University. 
There are modules on Canvas 
before arriving on campus, as well 
as countless resources for support. 
The University acknowledges how 
mentally draining the environment 
can become if you lack confidence 
in your knowledge and ability. But 
are they doing enough? Despite 
their efforts, this feeling still stops 
students from performing at their 
best. 70% of people experience 
imposter syndrome at some point 
in their career. There is a constant 
fear of failure as a student at 
Michigan. According to an article 
by our School of Public Health, 
Michigan’s annual Healthy Minds 

Study reported that “among the 
respondents, 47% screened positive 
for clinically significant symptoms 
of depression and/or anxiety.” 
In addition, many studies have 
uncovered anxiety as a comorbid 
condition with imposter syndrome 
and that high school students who 
experienced imposter syndrome 
feelings “correlated significantly 
with a history of prior suicidal 
ideation 
and 
attempts 
and 

depression.”

The University needs to break the 

silence and let its students know that 
there is nothing wrong with feeling 
inadequate. Feeling uncomfortable in 
an unfamiliar situation is ultimately a 
positive experience. It illustrates that 
you are stepping out of your comfort 
zone. Professors need to work to 
promote a comfortable classroom 
environment 
that 
facilitates 

discussion and encourages getting 
answers wrong to develop further 
understanding of the material. By 
bringing in successful alumni to 
speak about their own struggles with 
the fear of failure, it could help prove 
that even those who look like they 
have it all together, feel the same way. 
As a community, we need to become 
more transparent about how we 
are doing. There is no need to hide 
behind the perfect persona of the 
perfect student. Based on the data, 
we likely are all dealing with similar 
issues, so we need to support one 
another to not feel alone. 

While being at this type of 

university may be overwhelming 
and 
daunting 
now, 
graduating 

with a degree from the No. 1 public 
university will set you apart from 
other applicants in the professional 
world. 
The 
expansive 
alumni 

network connects you across the 
globe. While the plethora of courses 
and 
organizations 
may 
seem 

daunting now, these opportunities 
are precisely what makes you thrive 
post-graduation due to the abundance 
of experience and knowledge gained. 
No other university can replace 
the spirit that booms through the 
Big House on a fall Saturday or the 
drive that exists in every student 
here. Rather than doubting yourself 
and letting the pressure sink in, take 
full advantage of every opportunity 
and every second at this amazing 
university. Through the staff and 
ambiance of this place, we have the 
tools to thrive and become the best 
version of ourselves. That is why the 
Wall Street Journal ranked us as the 
No. 1 public university.

I 

entered Auditorium D in Angell 
Hall on an otherwise unremarkable 

Monday afternoon. Well, it would be 
unremarkable if it wasn’t the first day 
of class. Might I add, it was the first 
day of in-person classes in over a year. 
I found my seat and prepared myself 
for another long ride, but hopefully a 
refreshing one after a year of Zoom 
University. I got out my notebook, 
opened my laptop and was ready to 
jot down every word. As the professor 
began talking, going over introductions 
and so forth, I found myself starry-eyed 
for a moment. I truly believed this was 
going to be a good year. As time ticked 
on, and the class progressed, I was 
increasingly drawn in and enthralled 

by the subject. 

My professor was discussing how 

we were going to be studying power 
in politics and Congress. He discussed 
the topics we would be covering, the 
details of congressional functions and 
power dynamics on Capitol Hill as 
well as some of the issues Congress 
faces. Then, he started to talk about 
the kinds of people we were going to 
be learning from. At that moment, my 
starry eyes were sharply drawn open, 
alert and aware. I felt as if I had been 
slapped in the face. It wasn’t a hand 
that slapped me awake, but rather a 
string of words woven together in a 
sentence that in essence conveyed this: 
we are going to disregard what these 
people did, whether they were good or 
evil, whether they were right or wrong, 
and learn from them nonetheless 
because they knew something about 

power that you ought to know.

My professor continued this 

sentiment by stating, “We are not here 
to separate good from evil, or judge 
these people for their actions. We are 
here to learn from them, regardless 
of how bad they are. We are going 
to learn from segregationists, from 
people who supported slavery.”

A puzzled expression crept onto my 

face, not that anyone could see it under 
my mask, as my professor continued 
to talk about how we were going to 
be learning from Al Franken, who 
notoriously resigned after allegations 
of sexual misconduct. The professor 
quickly 
moved 
on, 
disregarding 

an opportunity to have a serious 
discussion about a controversial figure, 
and class ended soon after. 

G

rowing up, my parents frequently 
discussed taking me and my sister 

to Italy. I heard many stories about an 
almost mythical land — the country that 
my family is from, where fashionable 
people floated from cafes to museums and 
priceless art stood at every turn. Above all, 
we sought a world so different from our 
own, craving its unparalleled uniqueness. 
That vacation was their dream for us, so 
during Christmas of 2018, after over a 
year of planning, my sister and I left the 
country for the first time to finally visit 
this magical land.

We started in Rome, at the same hotel 

my parents stayed in 20 years before. The 
72 hours spent in the city occurred in an 
unending rush of activity, bouncing from 
the Vatican to the Trevi Fountain to the 
Colosseum. As we went about, I noticed 
some familiar names of stores in the U.S., 
but they were far from the main sites of the 
city, and especially far from the Vatican. 
From the tours through the ancient 
ruins and the lengthy dinners spent in 
restaurants my parents remembered 
fondly, I felt the magic of a new world we 
had dreamed of for so long. 

But the novelty of traveling dissipated 

after we arrived in Florence. I had 
expected it to be calmer than 
Rome. The 

latter was filled with endless sounds of 
chatter, honking taxis and bells in the air. 
Florence has world-renowned landmarks 
too — The Ponte Vecchio, Italian Galleria 
dell’Accademia featuring The David, 
The Uffizi, The Duomo, Michaelangelo’s 
tomb — but it had a quaint taste, at least in 
theory. 

But what truly amazed us was not 

the throngs of people waiting with us for 
the same major attractions, but the lack 
of culture right outside of them. Local 
businesses that once lined the streets 
were replaced by department stores and 
luxury shopping: H&M, Zara, Gucci, 
Versace, Prada and more. It had the 
same atmosphere as a mall I could find 
40 minutes from my small town. It was 
too familiar. On this of the Arno river, 
where the tourists mainly frequented, the 
Florentine-ness, as I refer to it, felt diluted.

Tourism, more specifically how to be 

an ethical tourist, has been a growing 
topic, especially in activist spaces. 

Shopping, specifically department stores 
and malls, offers us familiarity in a foreign 
place. While shopping itself isn’t immoral, 
the standardization of these industries 
in catering toward tourists tramples the 
local businesses, and therefore the city’s 
unique culture. It was close to impossible 
to find any native Florentine businesses. 
Perhaps it is selfish of me, desiring the 
roots and labors of this complex city, but 
I would like to believe my desires also 
reflect an appreciation for them as well. 

This means of consumerism goes 

beyond Florence and Europe in general. 
Mass tourism to Hawaii has negatively 
impacted its culture and environment, 
draining these resources away from the 
Native inhabitants. Unlike the situation 
in Florence, a study of Hawaii and other 
locations 
involves 
conversations 
of 

racism and ecotourism. Limited by my 
own experiences and knowledge, I won’t 
discuss these intersectional factors, but 
bear them in mind as you travel outside 
of the mainland United States. This 
is to say these critiques aren’t focused 
solely on Florence. Negative effects of 
tourism across the world take root in this 
globalization.

Part of being a good tourist is like being 

a good guest; you know the customs and 
rules and you respect the host and take 
part in their lifestyle. Relating to the idea 
of escapism when traveling, one should 
maintain a certain level of awareness as 
they go about. Who and what are you 
engaging with, and what is that doing for 
your host city?

Most importantly, recognize that 

your experience is not solely tied to 
tickets and tours. Some of my favorite 
moments had nothing to do with the 
major attractions surrounding us. They 
came in many forms; laughing at the 
British tourist who nearly trampled 
us in Raphael’s room of the Vatican 
museum; a picture from Christmas 
day that had a beam of light shooting 
into my hands, as if it could be a sign 
from my grandpa; linking arms as we 
wandered down cobblestone streets 
and happened upon cafes; making a 
brief friendship with a waiter who 
remembered us when we returned two 
days later because the food was too 
good to not have again before we left 
for home.

ecently, it has come to my 
attention that more and more 

openly gay men are joining fraternities. 
As a first-generation, gay student from 
the rural North, I understand the 
appeal of joining a fraternity. I’ll be 
honest, I even tried — to no avail — to 
rush as a sophomore. Finally being 
accepted by a group of masculine 
straight men would be a dream come 
true to a young gay kid who never fit 
in. Gay people throughout time have 
had to make their own families, and 
I understand the appeal of wanting 
a group of friends you can call your 
“brothers.” But that is the same 
reason I am glad I did not receive a 
bid. I realized that I was trying to 
reach a sense of hyper-masculinity or 
aggressively male behavior that I felt I 
lacked for being gay. This internalized 
homophobia is a struggle for many 
younger gay men. It is also why I 
believe so many younger white gay 
men are joining fraternities now.

But, is that sense of validation worth 

contributing to a system with a history 
of violent racism, homophobia and 
misogyny? The other day I watched 
a TikTok where an openly gay white 
fraternity brother joked about how he 
has to make sure that girls know that 
they are “safe” around him because 
he is not straight. In a sense, he knows 
that fraternities are infamous for being 
a dangerous place for women, but for 
some reason being gay absolves him 
from that part of the fraternity? Gay 
people are no strangers to violence, 
especially sexual violence, so why 
would you as a gay person contribute 
to a culture that perpetuates it? 

A lot of people like to argue that 

by being gay in a fraternity, a person 
can help dismantle the institutional 
homophobia of Greek life. To 
that, I ask: Why are there so many 
closeted men in fraternities? In my 
experience, a fraternity — no matter 
how progressive the school they 
are at is — is going to be completely 
unwilling to accept a pledge if they 
are not heterosexual passing. In fact, 
I was told by a member of one of the 

fraternities I tried to rush that “they 
probably wouldn’t bid a member if 
they knew that he was gay.” So then, 
what exactly is a gay person gaining 
from their fraternity other than 
validation from their straight peers? 
I’ve heard arguments that some gay 
guys might want the recognition that 
comes with certain fraternity letters 
or just guys to drink with. However, 
there are plenty of organizations 
on campus that provide a sense of 
community without the toxicity 
of a fraternity. White gay men 
especially are criticized for their 
lack of social awareness. We may 
be gay, but we still benefit from 
the privilege of our skin color 
and the fact that it is fairly easy 
to pass as straight. This comes 
with a responsibility to fight against 
systems 
that 
oppress 
LGBTQ+ 

people of color, not join them. If you 
have the privilege of passing enough 
to join a fraternity, you should use it to 
help your community, not contribute 
to systems that hurt it.

You’re not breaking barriers by 

being gay in a fraternity

om Ford suit, Omega watch,

shoes. 

Aston Martin for the car, Walther 
for the gun and Bollinger for the 
champagne. During the last 15 years, 
class was spelled “C-R-A-I-G.” For 
nearly the same timeframe, the 
name “Merkel” was synonymous 
with leadership. Now, I’m struggling 
to say goodbye to both of them.

I was three when Angela Merkel 

became chancellor of Germany 
and four when Daniel Craig first 
embodied the role of Britain’s finest 
spy. I grew up watching Merkel be 
the only responsible adult in a room 
full of world leaders and Craig’s 
embodiment of James Bond saving 
that world time and time again. They 
remind me of an epoch that’s gone, 
never to return. 

Both Bond and Merkel are 

products of the Cold War; perhaps 
too dated and archaic for this era of 
populism and galactic heroes. As 
much as I enjoy watching Marvel 
put out another entry into its cosmic 
saga, the simplicity of the man with 
the three-number name makes my 
heart race. Also, as engrossing as the 
Trump-era of television can be, now 
when I watch channels like CNN 
and Fox News I long for the days 
of Truman and Eisenhower, when 

politics was about making prudent 
choices. I never got to be a part of 
that generation, but Angela Merkel 
made me feel like I did. 

Sometimes I wish the world 

were more comprehensible, that its 
battles could be resolved through 
suave spies. Sometimes I wish global 
politics were still seemingly divided 
into two ideological camps. At least 
then we’d know who the enemy 
was. That’s not the case anymore. 
Today, we see insurrections on 
American soil. We see vaccines 
being politicized. We see nutjobs 
and extremists becoming members 
of Congress. So I wonder: Is there a 
place for the Bonds and Merkels of 
the world nowadays?

Chancellor 
Merkel 
was 
a 

pragmatist. Even as a conservative, 
she opened the borders of her 
country to all refugees searching 
for a home. She found a way to 
solve the Euro-zone debt crisis. 
And she prevented the EU’s demise 
after the tragedy that was (and is) 
“Brexit.” Merkel holds the highest 
approval rating of any world leader 
16 years after stepping into office. 
Her party, the Christian Democratic 
Union, is struggling to find a worthy 
successor. Their choice for this 
general election, Armin Laschet, 
has almost certainly lost his bid for 
the chancellorship. Two years ago, 
Merkel’s heir apparent, Annegret 
Kramp-Karrenbauer, lost her place 

as the CDU’s leader following a 
political scandal. All of this isn’t 
surprising: the shadow of Merkel 
would loom large over anyone. And 
guess what — whether it’s Henry 
Cavill, Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, 
Michael Fassbender or someone 
else, they will all flounder in trying 
to replace Daniel Craig as he leaves 
the character that made him famous.

It took several generations of 

middling Bonds to find a sterling 
inheritor for Sir Sean Connery. 
None of them were terrible. Most 
incorporated the main aspects 
that characterize Bond into their 
roles. Yet Craig (with some help 
from Dame Judi Dench, Ralph 
Fiennes, 
Ben 
Whishaw 
and 

Naomi Harris, along with Mads 
Mikkelsen’s and Javier Bardem’s 
stellar villains) brought back the 
perfect Bond combination of craggy 
and debonair. In contrast, Merkel 
had a standard to meet when she 
became chancellor. Phenomenal, 
transformational 
leaders 
like 

Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt 
and Helmut Kohl occupied the 
office before her. In fact, Merkel’s 
political 
ascent 
began 
during 

Kohl’s administration, as Minister 
for Women and Youth. Hence, the 
Merkel-Craig pair had tough jobs 
ahead, but both outperformed 
expectations.

I’ve known that I’d like to 

become 
a 
lawyer 
someday 

for what seems like forever. 
Whenever I’m asked where 
my love for the law is rooted, 
my mind usually goes to one 
of three places or all three at 
the same time depending on 
the conversation I’m having. In 
response I tell people: 

1. My love for law is rooted in 
my identities as a Palestinian, 
Muslim, Arab woman, and the 
marginalizations that each of 
those identities encounters in 
white societies. Having been at 
the forefront of witnessing and 
experiencing what it meant to 
carry these identities instilled 
in me a desire to commit to 
social justice and reform and to 
be a part of making the change 
my communities want to see on 
a legal level. 

2. My love for law is rooted 
in my hatred of STEM. Ever 
since I was young, I knew I 
didn’t want to be a doctor or 
nurse or engineer despite the 
way my siblings were drawn 
to these fields. Furthermore, 
this became abundantly clear 
when it was my English, civics, 
economics and social science 
classes that kept me engaged all 
throughout my pre-university 
schooling, and the dread I felt 
for my natural science classes 
became a norm. 

3. 
And 
sometimes, 
only 

sometimes, I’ll tell people that 
I sealed the deal on law after 
watching “Legally Blonde.”

At 13 years old, I fell victim 

to 
the 
chokehold 
“Legally 

Blonde” seemed to have on its 
viewers 
after 
watching 
the 

movie for the very first time. 
Little did I know, that would be 
the first of countless “Legally 
Blonde” binge nights or that the 
movie would seemingly have 
much more of an impact on 
me than I would’ve expected. 
I finished the movie starry-
eyed, completely in awe of Elle 
Woods’s confidence, feistiness 
and overall aura. The glitz and 
glam and hot pink pantsuits in 
combination with the “big-time” 
Harvard law degree seemed like 
everything I wanted my future 
to encapsulate. 

However, being closer to a 

professional degree now than 
I was in middle school, I have 
started to increasingly pick 
out the faults that the movie 
demonstrates. 
What 
became 

increasingly clear is that the 
entirety of the movie revolves 
around traditional notions of 
femininity. 
When 
we 
think 

of Elle Woods, we think of an 
ultra-feminine figure, almost 
as “girly” as one can get. 
Throughout the movie, it seems 
like the idea that is constantly 
reiterated is that to be accepted 
in predominantly male fields is 
to be ultra-feminine. From her 
over-the-top extravagant daily 
outfits to her weekly manicure 

appointments 
and 
even 
her 

pink, scented résumé, her entire 
being screams femininity. In 
reality, there is a certain level 
of femininity that is expected 
of women in professional spaces 
— whether that is the clothes 
they wear, the way they do their 
hair or the other ways they 
present themselves. Elle Woods 
carves a path for herself in the 
predominantly male field of 
law, but the fact that she is so 
extremely feminine seems to be 
used as a tool to accomplish this. 
Arguably the most iconic scene 
in the movie is when Elle busts 
the suspect on trial for having 
murdered her own father. Elle 
makes this breakthrough in 
the case because the suspect 
claimed that she had gotten a 
perm and then went home to 
shower, and returned to find 
her father shot. Elle, being 
extremely sound in all things 
beauty-related, quickly pointed 
out that the suspect was lying 
because the number-one rule 
after getting a perm is to avoid 
wetting the hair. It’s made 
clear that Elle only knew this 
information and was able to 
make this breakthrough because 
she’s so “girly.” I can’t help but 
wonder if the same experience 
that Elle Woods had would be 
the same experience a woman 
of color would have, as they 
are often not regarded with the 
same lens of fragility, femininity 
and innocence as white women. 
The answer is most probably no.

A journey of change

MARIAM ALSHOURBAGY

MiC Columnist

We would starve if flour didn’t change into bread, and we would 

freeze if wood didn’t change into fire. For us who are constantly in 
motion, change is inevitable.

But this time it wasn’t 
the same kind of change.
As grains of sand chased the wounded wind
Migrating from the desert to this mourning street
Those little grains infiltrating every empty corner
Touched the cold ground and covered its scars
Listened to the wind mourn and dried its tears
Saw the crowd disperse
Then flew away.
As I opened my eyes to cry
The wind carried the sand into my eyes
I shake the grains off
Then cover my eyes and never open them again. 
I am allowed to cry when the wind is too strong
I’m allowed to be, allowed to fall, allowed to heal
Before living, confronting, accepting. 
I wasn’t ready.
After the careful talk
The worried stares
The quiet concern
I 
just 
didn’t 
care.

But the sand was running out
So I allowed myself a peek
 I still wasn’t ready
To open them completely
That smile and kindness aren’t found everywhere
I close my eyes again and feel the familiar scent in the air.
I still wasn’t ready 
To let go of those summer days
The hands that held mine
Now lying empty on the bedside.
I’ve walked these streets long enough to know everyone
By name, last name, and addresses
I now fear the day I saw them wearing their black dresses
And I look at them and see my grief mirrored
Their mouths straight and their faces withered.
When will I have the courage to accept this change?
“Everything we did together death did not erase
His name is spoken like it’s a familiar place”
Our life goes on and he’s still in it
One has his smile, one his kindness, 
One has his passion, one his dedication, and one his wisdom.
So no, my grandpa’s death wasn’t one of those changes. It was about 

the journey of change, one filled with grief and denial, followed by 
guidance and realization.

The sun beat down through 

my opened bedroom window and 
warmed my room. Every light in 
my room had been on for hours, 
increasing the warmth. Clothes 
covered every inch of carpet, except 
for the 3-foot space in front of my 
full body mirror that my dad and I 
built together a couple of years prior. 
That space was instead covered with 
every makeup product I owned. 
The brushes lay on the bare carpet, 
leaving 
small 
pink 
eyeshadow 

marks behind. My phone rested 
in the middle of my bed charging, 
while it simultaneously played my 
November Spotify playlist, repeating 
my favorite three songs from it — 
one being “Good Habits (and Bad)” 
by Saba Lou, a song that made me 
reminisce about my childhood due 
to the innocent nature of the song. 
(The song, which focuses on what 
a child considers as bad habits, is 
sung and written from a child’s 
point of view.) The sun was setting 
and it was starting to get dark. I was 
already late. I applied my final coat of 
mascara while my hand shook from 
the excitement that rushed through 
my body and the nervousness that 
clouded my mind. It was my first 

second date, ever. With the same guy 
who took me on my first real date, 
ever. 

Our first date, a week prior, was a 

picnic — something we liked enough 
to agree to do it as our second date. 
The green flags and sweet things he 
did on the first date all ran through 
my mind: how he helped me climb 
in and out of his car through the 
driver’s seat door since the passenger 
door was blocked by another car; 
how he was so understanding when 
I told him about the anxiety I get 
while driving, and immediately said 
that we would only picnic at the park 
by my house so that I wouldn’t have 
to drive much. How he didn’t change 
his mind after realizing it would take 
him over half an hour of freeway 
driving one-way; how he didn’t get 
uncomfortable holding my hand 
even though my hand was grossly 
sweaty from being so nervous; how 
he let me play my music the entire 
car ride, even though his music taste 
was the complete opposite. And my 
favorite: how at the end of the date, 
he asked me if he could kiss me 
before just going in for it. 

I waited in my car at the park, 

texting my best friend about how 
nervous I was. “What if he ends 
whatever this is cuz he doesn’t like 
me anymore.” She reassured me, 
ending our conversation with our 
normal “have fun, be safe <3” text. 
When he arrived, he pulled me into 
a hug with his warm hands. They 
were warmer than mine, something 
I hadn’t found with anyone else. But 
the warmth was nice and comforting 
and made me feel safe. So safe that 
my nervousness shifted to a blissful 
feeling. So safe that I forgot about 
all my other worries to just enjoy 

his company. So safe that my eyes 
wouldn’t let out a single tear no 
matter how much I wanted them to 
as he lay on top of me less than an 
hour later. So safe that my mouth 
wouldn’t let out a single noise no 
matter how much I tried to say no. 
So safe that my body wouldn’t move 
no matter how much I tried to push 
him off. 

At that moment, I felt numb. I no 

longer felt the warmth in his hands. 
But I just knew his hands were still 
there. I laid in silence, with my eyes 
wide open, and emotionlessly stared 
at the stars in the sky, even while 
he kept kissing me. The extreme 
amount of layers I was wearing 
didn’t stop him. But worst of all, 
neither did I. 

To make things worse, I was 

so blinded by his attention and 
validation that I normalized what 
happened to me. I went home that 
night and was so worried that he 
didn’t want to go out again, that I 
failed to realize I didn’t. And when 
he texted me the next day about 
how the whole night felt off because 
we were both just tired, I agreed, 
putting some of the blame on myself. 
The fact that he was the first guy that 
I went on a date with worsened the 
entire situation. 

He knows what he’s doing. This 

is what happens on all other dates. 
Maybe he just couldn’t tell I was 
uncomfortable. I should’ve said no. 
He didn’t do anything wrong. This is 
just his way of showing he’s into me. 
He’s probably done the same to all the 
previous girls, so I should be fine with 
it as well.

Your ruling planet Mars 
enters Scorpio in your 

eighth house of rebirth. You 
may have been avoiding an 
underlying issue in your life. 
However, now is the time to 
charge forward and face your 

problems head-on.

Mercury in your sixth house 
of organization trines Saturn 

in your tenth house, which 
marks a great time to orga-
nize your office space and 
your work files. A cleaner 
workspace may help you 
become more productive.

Geminis are known for being 
very sporadic and energetic, 

but this also means you cannot 
be contained by a schedule or 
deadlines. Mars in Scorpio en-
courages you to rein your zeal 

in by placing your absolute 
focus on one thing at a time 
until you see it to completion.

When Mars enters fellow 

water sign Scorpio in your fifth 

house of creativity, you will 
become deeply immersed in 
your creative work. You may 

come to some emotional break-

throughs that can fuel your 

creative process.

Mars transitions into Scorpio 
in your fourth house of home 
and family, which indicates 
that your relationships with 
your family and childhood 

friends may suddenly become 

much closer. Now is a good 

time to reach out and ask them 

how they’re doing.

Virgos are always great com-
municators and meticulous lis-
teners, and Mars in Scorpio is 
about to bring this intensity to 
the next level. Now is a great 
time to strike up a conversa-
tion with just about anyone in 
order to gain some valuable 

insight.

Now is a great time to get to 
know people on a much deep-

er level and evaluate your 
compatibility in a relation-
ship. If you’re currently in a 
relationship, this is a great 
opportunity to deepen your 
relationship even further.
This is a great time to start a 
creative project or pursue an 
intellectual idea. Now is also a 
great time to resolve any linger-

ing conflicts you may have 

with yourself or others. While 
conflict resolution may be dif-
ficult, you will feel incredibly 
invigorated if every problem 

is fixed.

When Mars enters Scorpio in 
your twelfth house of subcon-
sciousness, you may feel a lot 
more passionate about your 

creative pursuits. Sagittarians 
enjoy chasing many different 
desires, but this is the time to 
commit to one idea and see it 

through.

At this time, you may really start 

to deepen your bond between 
friends you didn’t view as close 
before. You could unearth a lot of 
their virtues and desires, which 
may allow you to gain incredibly 
wise insights to apply to your own 
life. You may feel pressured to hide 
away parts of yourself in order to 

appeal to others, but you 
shouldn’t be afraid to be 

yourself.

When Mars enters Scorpio 

and your tenth house of career 

ambitions, you will dig deep 
in order to find clarity in your 

professional goals. Are you 
satisfied with your current 

life path? Do you see yourself 

pursuing this career for the rest 

of your life?

Mars transitions into Scorpio 
and your ninth house of phi-

losophy, which means that your 
mind is going to become much 
more focused on your education. 
Pisceans are very imaginative 
and curious, and now is a great 
time to feed your curiosity by 
pursuing an intellectual topic 

you feel passionate about.


I often feel conflicted when I hear the phrase “You are a strong Black 

woman.” I usually think, “Of course I know that,” or “Do I otherwise seem 
weak?” It’s a phrase that elicits a flurry of emotions from me, ranging 
from confusion to almost accepting my moment of strength.

Over the years, I have had to grapple with this phrase. On one 

hand, I am all for understanding and emphasizing the strength 
behind being a Black woman, but on the other hand, it feels like it takes 
away from our vulnerability. To me, nothing makes you stronger than 
being vulnerable and being able to communicate your feelings. Over 
the years, Black women have always had to be strong for themselves, 
their families and their communities. 

As Malcolm X once said, “The most disrespected person in America 

is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the 
Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black 
woman.” This doesn’t only mean being looked down on for being both 
a woman and Black, but it also means being underestimated, which 
has been made evident through Serena Williams her entire tennis 
career or Allyson Felix in her fight for maternal rights with Nike. It 
means knowing we have to consider what we name our children so 
they aren’t discriminated against when they are applying for jobs.

Beyond this, Black women are the most unprotected people 

in America. For example, when Megan Thee Stallion was shot in 
the foot by Tory Lanez, the internet made jokes about it instead of 
having empathy. Our pain is constantly undermined or receives 
little to no attention even when it is most pressing. In all walks of life, 
Black women are oversexualized or deprecated for their looks or 
unappreciated in general. Even in work settings, Black women have 
to wear certain outfits to feel respected and be seen as an equal no 
matter how hard we work. We have to shield ourselves from prying 
eyes even as young girls.

In general, as Black women, we are constantly called “emotional,” 

“irrational” and “temperamental.” However, when we show our 
strength, we are called “demanding,” “controlling” and “aggressive.” 
We are all strong, but we all have areas of our lives where we are 
vulnerable. I would rather connect with the people around me, 
emotionally and intellectually, instead of having to constantly walk a 
tightrope or stay reserved and “strong.” I continue to learn to adapt 
by looking at the women in my life who radiate strength, poise and 
compassion in spite of the circumstances that try to restrict them.

One of the strongest women I know is my mother. This is not 

because of the strength she needed to raise my brother and me, but 
rather because of how she never saw herself as small, despite being 
5’3”. She refuses to be underestimated and always stands her ground. 
Her strength is evident in her eloquent words, her posture and her 
smile. My mother is always strong, but her power is often shown 
through different outlets such as humor, her tears or the way she hugs 
me. 

We don’t need a phrase to constantly remind us we are strong, 

because strength is ingrained in us. Our ancestors had no choice but 
to be strong, no choice but to be the roots in their house, no choice but 
to be part of the armor that protected their families. Black women 
are “strong” in not only the traditional notions of strength, but also 
in our love and vulnerability. To be a Black woman is so much more 
than strength, and “strength” should not define who we are. We are 
defined by our loving hands, our words of wisdom, our ability to help 
our community and everything in between, not by our strength alone.

A reflection on three things that bring beauty 

for those who need inspiration finding it in everyday places 

T

he sky: One of the biggest flaws of human 
nature is we become so used to what sur-
rounds us, no matter how incredible it may be, 

and we forget how miraculous it is. Every single morn-
ing, the entire scope of the horizon drips with gold, rose, 
violet and monarch orange. The sun lights the sky into 
a blue powerful enough to illuminate the entire world 
around us from millions of miles away. After revert-
ing back to a marble of warm and cool colors, the sky 
darkens into pitch black and glitters with stars, encom-
passing a moon that illuminates the stillness of the 
night. In a world that’s been incredibly industrialized, 
with every other corner a construction site or an office 
building, the constancy and simplicity of the sky’s pres-
ence have always reassured me. It’s amazing to think 
that when we look above, that same sun, moon and sky 
has been over the human species since we began to 
exist. When you need to escape from the rush of your 
life, just look up and take it in. Take in the fact that there 
is a whole other realm above you whose sunshine and 
rain mimic the fluctuation of human emotions. It goes 
through its ups and downs, the sun rises and sets, the 
sky shines and rains, the moon appears full one night 
and then disappears the next, just like the way we feel 
can change within every given moment. The sky con-
nects us to a network much larger than just the human 

species or other living organisms. It lets us look up and 
see a part of the universe within us. Or, as Rumi says, 
“To see the moon that cannot be seen, Turn your eyes 
inward and look at yourself, in silence.”
F

lowers: There are hundreds of kinds of 
flowers, all of which come from a seed, and 
yet bloom unique from one another. There is 

a surprising amount to learn if we observe the process 
in which flowers grow. They start rising after they’ve 
been buried, and are completely unseen to the eye 
until they sprout above the ground just the tiniest 
bit, eventually turning into a fragrant, beautiful, 
vibrant flower that people stop to stare at. It serves 
as a reminder that we, like flowers, still have the 
chance to flourish even after we feel like we’ve 
been beaten down. Starting from somewhere small 
doesn’t necessitate that we won’t be able to bloom 
and accomplish phenomenal things. Flowers are 
beautiful because they show us that even though 
our circumstances and successes may come from 
seemingly negligible beginnings, if we reach our full 
potential, we can grow into extraordinary people 
who can accomplish remarkable things.

Like the growth of a flower, Tagore’s description of a 

flower’s purpose can be embodied by us as well:

“Flowers are 
The Earth’s endless effort
To speak
To the listening heaven.”

T

ea: Sitting in front of a window, rain hitting 
the windowsill, a book in hand and an earthy 
cup of steaming milk tea is how I’d describe 

my perfect night. To me, chai is special because it’s 
been a part of my routine since I was a kid. Before I 
started kindergarten, my mom would give me three 
sips of tea a day, and since then, it’s been a constant part 
of my life. No matter how busy I get, even if I’m late to 
class or I’m missing an important meeting, nothing 
comes before my one cup of tea in the morning and my 
one cup of tea at 4 p.m. I drink the same kind of chai 
every day, the kind my parents and their parents had 
before they immigrated from Pakistan. It’s become a 
family activity, everyone sitting down and drinking 
tea together, sharing their funny stories or unique 
experiences of the day. You may not like tea. But find 
something that brings you so much simple joy that it 
may become your daily teacup, something that lets you 
step away from the world and breathe a few breaths of 
relaxation. Find a shared experience you can do with 
the people you love that creates space for conversation 
and community. Find your tea, anything that lets you 
reflect on how you are feeling with people who value 
listening to your experiences so that no matter what 
else is going on in your life, happy or sad, you will 
always find a moment to relax and take it in one sip at 
a time.

The complexity of chai can be best explained by 

Ralph Waldo Emerson: “There is a great deal of poetry 
and a fine sentiment in a chest of tea.”

Texts as texts

KARIS CLARK
MiC Columnist

In the car. On the bus. In the 

classroom. In the bathroom. In the 
store. At the game. In the theatre. 
Right when we wake up. And 
right as we go to bed. Incessantly 
throughout the day and deep into the 
night, texting takes up a tremendous 
amount of our time, often without us 
even realizing it.

We’ve all seen the commercials 

cautioning 
against 
texting 
and 

driving with the staggering statistics 
to boot. On a smaller scale, we’ve 
witnessed professors profess to 
their pupils their disdain for texting 
in class, threatening not to pass 
those who do so, yet nonetheless, 
students still find a way. But what is 
it about this simple act of electronic 
communication 
that 
has 
the 

capability to apprehend our attention 
and prompt us to precipitously situate 
ourselves in precarious positions? 

Is texting a pathological pastime 

to which our society must acquiesce, 
or is there a deeper mystical meaning 
to our messages? A sacred essence of 
our daily digital conversations? If we 
see texts as texts, documentations 
of our social experience carrying 
with it divine implications, we might 
get a better understanding of our 
underlying reliance on them as a 
mediating tool for communication.

Jungian psychotherapist Thomas 

Moore, in his book “Soul Mates,” 
dedicates a chapter to “Letters and 
Conversations.” He claims that 
writing letters has a profound effect 
on our soul in the sense that it serves 
our “soul’s organ of rumination 
rather than the mind’s capacity for its 
understanding.” 

Writing letters requires ample 

reflection. 
Unlike 
face-to-face 

conversation, our words are chosen 
in precise, proximate and purposeful 
manners and we give extreme weight 
to what we decide to disclose and 
what we choose to conceal. All of this 
reigns true for texting, which can 
easily be seen as an advanced form 
of letter writing and sending. Moore 
maintains that there is an artfulness 
and thoughtfulness inherent in this 
method of expression. 

Many of us have had the 

experience 
of 
ruminating 
over 

our word choice in the process 
of revealing bad news, texting a 
crush or engaging in an argument. 
Sometimes pressing send can feel 
like launching a missile. Even the 
shortest response can fill us with 
an insurmountable dread. One text 
can make a day or ruin a week, and 
waiting for a text back can fill us with 
anxiety like no other. Of course, this 
is only exacerbated when texting 
is our only means of long-distance 
communication with an individual. 
A text from an old friend or flame 
can be a game-changer in a rather 
mundane day — for better or for 
worse.

Our texts have the capacity 

preserved for posterity, as we 
allow each recipient to revel in the 
revelation of our own transient 
thoughts, emotions and experiences 
as soon as we press send. There’s 
an element of enormous trust 
between the sender and recipient, 
so fundamental to our texts, which 
is predicated on this notion of 
revelation and disclosure. In texting, 
we reveal information that we 
wouldn’t dare to discuss in person. 
We deal out details and disclose 
important truths, trusting that our 
musings are mediated in confidence. 
Yet, as French philosopher Georges 
Bataille asserts, any accumulation of 
knowledge is also an accumulation 
of non-knowledge. The more we 

unveil to one another, the more 
we realize how much more there 
is to be unveiled. The dangers of 
divulging in this medium manifest 
in the impermanence of our modern-
day devices. Unlike face-to-face 
conversations, anything we say via 
virtual communication can easily 
be shared without our permission, 
taken deliberately out-of-context, 
re-purposed, 
re-defined 
and 

ultimately used as a “receipt” for later 
occasions. In other words, oftentimes 
in texting, curiosity can kill the chat. 

Moreover, Moore asserts that the 

“person whom we write our letters to 
is more imaginal than actual.” 

We have a perception of that 

person in our mind as we write out 
our message that is mostly made up 
and, for all intents and purposes, 
a falsified fantasy. We never truly 
know what the person behind the 
screen is actually thinking, doing or 
feeling when we text them, contrary 
to how they might communicate 
with us in the conversation. 

Yet it’s the transient nature of 

texts preserved for posterity that 
endows them with a divine quality. 
As Moore states, “Re-reading (is) a 
form of reflective meditation.” 

Texts are a portal to the past. They 

dissolve the lines between space 
and time, giving us more insight 
into our own or other’s feelings in 
a fleeting instance. Going through 

old texts from my family and close 
friends has made me see how our 
communication with each other has 
changed over time.

I recall recently re-reading texts 

from my old phone and coming 
across a group chat I had with 
close high school friends in 2019, 
the summer before I came to the 
University of Michigan. It was a very 
anxious August, as I prepared myself 
to move away from my hometown. I 
likened the experience of choosing 
between colleges to committing to a 
marriage, claiming I felt like a bride 
getting cold feet before her wedding. 
I talked about my expansive plans 

for my college experience and the 
different clubs I wanted to join — 
some of which I didn’t and some 
of which I did. Some of the things I 
dreamt about doing then, I would 
despise doing now. Yet other dreams 
became reality — like writing for a 
satire paper and joining an improv 
team. When I first went through 
those texts, I didn’t recall being that 
anxious before starting school (yet 
rightfully so) and I had forgotten 
wanting to be in all the clubs I never 
joined. The things I did want to do 
which came true shocked me as 
well. I couldn’t believe how long 
ago I had considered being a part of 
certain groups or organizations. Yet 
as psychology researcher Elizabeth 
Kensinger recounts, our memory is 

widely subject to distortion, causing 
us to forget basic details of past 
events from where we are, who we 
are with, what we are doing, etc. 
Our accounts of events are likely 
to change over time. Retroactive 
interference also makes it so that 
newly gained information interferes 
with our retrieval and memory of 
past events. In this vein, our old 
texts being recollections of events in 
relative real-time, allow us to recall 
more accurately how we felt in the 
past. 

At first, I wanted to write those 

texts out to be an exemplification 
of my blissful ignorance, overt 

ambition and immaturity, but 
then I also found very similar 
texts this August, as I dwelled 
on my own anxiety and fears 
about returning in person after a 
year of virtual schooling. In the 
present, we’re divorced from our 
dialogues of the past, and our 
perception of what we wrote way-
back-when is significantly altered 
with time. I’ve cringed at how I’ve 
responded to texts a week ago, 
was totally surprised at texts sent 
a month ago and utterly confused 
at conversations from a year ago. 
Nonetheless, I always admire how 
much I’ve evolved yet at the same 
time stayed the same. Much like 
back then, I still spend ample time 
storytelling over text to my friends, 

persisting in giving a creative, 
chronological retelling of every 
peculiar instance of love, hate, 
drama and comedy I come across 
in the day-to-day. Maybe it’s just 
the writer in me, but I really do be 
texting way too damn much. 

In looking through old texts, 

I’ve noticed the subtle intricacies 
and complexities that vary yet also 
persist in my various conversations 
with individuals — how others and 
myself respond to exciting news 
and announcements (acceptances, 
jobs, promotions, releases, etc) 
or pressure and duress (losses, 
rejections, break-ups, etc). I also 
noticed the differing ways I said 
the same thing — in essence — 
to different people. Changes in 
dialect, code-switching, omissions 
of certain facts or the adding in of 
certain details, all became clear and 
clarified how I related to that person 
at that moment. In written form, it’s 
easier to recognize the distinct ways 
in which the people closest to us 
exhibit what Erich Fromm denotes 
as the four basic elements of love: 
care, responsibility, respect and 
knowledge.

Care and respect manifest in the 

simplest of syllables, the “I / love 
you” texts, sometimes given with 
reservation and other times with 
jubilation. It’s the paragraphs of 
pensive consideration and concern, 
the 
checking-in 
and 
hearing 

out. Responsibility manifests in 
responsiveness 
(responsibility 

meaning “being able and ready to 
respond”). When I was verbally 
accosted walking down the street 
in February, I was able to turn to 
my close friends over text who 
assuaged my fear and fright at the 
moment. Knowledge manifests in 
the knowing of those we’re closest to, 
being able to interpret what they’re 
saying and communicate effectively 
with them through such a separating 
mediated medium. 

Moore posits that “finding 

words that truly express our 
feelings and experiences is an 
achievement of a high order.” 
With this in mind, we should 
strive to see our texts as [holy] 
texts. By doing so they become 
an artful and expressive means 
of communication rather than a 
trivial tool for talking.

KALAMAZOO, 
MICH. 
— 

Senior forward Jimmy Lambert 
stood anxiously in the box, 
primed to bolt onto the ice as 
his minor penalty expired. As 
his skates hit the ice, the puck 
careened off the boards in front 
of him and he found himself in 
the play just like he’d prepared 
for.

But as he found the puck on 

his stick, the imposing figure of 
Western Michigan defenseman 
Aidan Fulp loomed over him. 
Taking the hit and passing the 
puck out behind him, Lambert 
connected 
with 
sophomore 

defenseman Owen Power, on 
a breakaway with a golden 
opportunity.

“Just 
chip 
the 
puck 
by, 

absorb the hit, take the hit, keep 
the puck moving,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said. “We 
talked about that a lot today … 
Western’s gonna step up and hit 
you, you had to just make sure 
you kept chipping.”

Power’s shot rang off the post, 

but it marked a turning point in 
the Wolverines’ approach to 
facing the Broncos’ physical 
game. They forged a newfound 
poise 
against 
Western 

Michigan’s heavy checking in 
Saturday’s overtime win

Michigan 
hadn’t 
faced 
a 

true, grinding performance all 
season. The closest it came was 
against Minnesota-Duluth, but 
that faded after the first period. 
The Broncos kept it up all 62 

minutes of the game.

Western 
Michigan’s 
play 

centered around its ability to hit 
hard and often, many of those 
coming from its big defensemen. 
For a speedy, finesse-oriented 
group like the Wolverines, the 
Broncos’ disruptive presence 
proved a significant challenge.

Some 
of 
Michigan’s 

adaptation came from the units 
Pearson put on the ice. After 
the Wolverines’ highly skilled 
forwards 
like 
sophomore 

forwards Matty Beniers and 
Kent Johnson struggled to find 
space in the first period, Pearson 
sent the bottom six out to wear 
down the Broncos.

Two key players in this were 

senior forwards Garrett Van 
Wyhe and Nolan Moyle. Two 
of the most physical presences 
on the Michigan roster, they 
absorbed 
many 
of 
Western 

Michigan’s hits and threw a few 
of their own. After countering a 
zone entry from the Broncos by 
standing up their forecheckers, 
the duo opened up space for the 
Wolverines’ second goal.

“Coming into their barn, we 

knew it was gonna be a physical 
one, especially after last night,” 
Moyle said. “We’ve got a lot of 
skill on this team, but just giving 
it right back to them, trying to 
grab as much as we could is what 
we tried to stick with.”

The Broncos’ early hits caught 

the Wolverines off guard, but 
as the game progressed they 
became 
more 
comfortable 

taking them. Like the Lambert 
play, they held the puck long 
enough to make a play and paid a 

physical price for that additional 
time. Making that trade paid off 
as Michigan created high danger 
chances when it got the puck.

That comfort also limited the 

grade-A chances that Western 
Michigan tried to force through 
its hitting. With eight minutes 
left in the second period, two 
Broncos 
chased 
sophomore 

defenseman 
Jacob 
Truscott 

behind the Wolverines’ net. 
Truscott cradled the puck while 
taking a hard hit, buying time 
for a teammate to grab the puck 
and clear it. What could have 
been a goal against turned into 
nothing.

“It ultimately comes down 

to compete, your will and want 
for it,” Moyle said. “We really 
settled in and started competing 
and taking some hits from them. 
And at that point, working hard, 
our skill will take over.”

But Michigan still struggled 

with 
Western 
Michigan’s 

checking. On both power play 
goals for the Broncos, they 
battled for territory in front of 
the net. Sophomore goaltender 
Erik Portillo couldn’t see the 
puck through these screens, and 
Western capitalized with goals. 
The same screens almost cost 
the Wolverines the game with 
1:42 left, but the goal was called 
back for a high tip.

Michigan fared poorly against 

Western Michigan’s physicality 
early on, but it adjusted on the 
fly to counter their aggressive 
style. Its performance was far 
from perfect, but it’s a step in 
the right direction to round out 
its skilled style.

Entering the overtime period 

in Sunday’s matchup between the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
(12-3-3 overall, 6-2-2 Big Ten) 
and Maryland (4-9-5, 0-7-3), it 
seemed as if the Wolverines had 
been cursed. In its final regular 
season game, Michigan nearly 
tripled the Terrapins’ shot total 
and quadrupled their shots on 
target. They dominated possession 
and created opportunity after 
opportunity in Maryland’s box. 
They even hit the goalpost on 
three separate occasions.

Despite controlling play, the 

Wolverines found themselves on 
the verge of losing both the game 
and their home field advantage 
in the upcoming Big Ten playoffs. 
But, these fears were soon quelled, 
as Michigan emerged victorious 
with a goal just thirty seconds into 
sudden death overtime, winning 
2-1.

“I thought we played really 

really well today,” Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein said. “It’s nice to get 
the result and get a goal for all of 
the opportunities and really nice 
soccer that we had.”

On paper, the game didn’t look 

like it would require overtime. 
The Terrapins entered Sunday’s 
matchup winless in conference 
play and in last place in the Big 
Ten. Yet despite their lackluster 
season record, Maryland started 
the game strong and put Michigan 
on the back foot early. 

After 
about 
10 
minutes, 

however, the game began to ebb 
in the Wolverines favor. Michigan 
looked 
dominant 
offensively, 

forcing the Terrapins deep into 
their own half. The game’s scoring 

opened in the 30th minute when 
graduate defender Alia Martin 
played a ball to senior midfielder 
Raleigh Loughman in the right 
side of the box. Loughman took 
the ball, and casually approached 
Maryland goalkeeper Liz Brucia 
before chipping it over her head 
and into the left corner of the net 
for her second goal in two games.

“Raleigh’s a player that has a 

good work rate,” Klein said. “But 
she also organizes and has good 
sophistication. 
I 
think 
you’re 

starting to see those goals because 
of the places she’s getting into and 
the quality of her execution.”

After the goal, the Wolverines 

maintained 
their 
momentum, 

nearly adding to their lead in 
the 32nd minute when senior 
midfielder Meredeth Haakenson 
fired a shot from close range 
that rammed into the crossbar 
before bouncing harmlessly away. 
Just a minute later, another ball 
was crossed to Haakenson, who 
headed it directly towards the 
goal, where it once again hit the 
woodwork, this time bouncing off 
of the left post.

Michigan entered halftime up 

only one goal, though clearly the 
game’s aggressor. But Maryland 
didn’t give up easily and opened 
the second half with an early goal 
from forward Mikayla Dayes, 
tying the game at one all. The 
Wolverines bounced back and 
regained control of the contest, 
putting 
intense 
pressure 
on 

Maryland and creating several 
major opportunities. 

In the 58th minute, sophomore 

forward Kacey Lawrence received 
a 
ball 
from 
Loughman 
and 

rocketed it off of the crossbar. 
In the 63rd minute, freshman 
midfielder Avery Kalitta collected 
a rebound with Brucia out of 

position and shot at a wide open 
net, but the Terrapins defenders 
stopped the ball on the goal line to 
keep the game tied. 

The remainder of the second 

half played out with the Wolverines 
thoroughly in control and getting 
ever closer to putting the ball in 
the back of the net, but never quite 
being able to finish the job. Time 
after time, the Wolverines put 
themselves in excellent positions 
to score, only to be denied by 
either luck, miscommunications or 
brilliant last-second defensive play 
from the Terrapins.

 “I think we did a really 

good job with our one touches 
throughout the box, but we also 
need to capitalize on just shooting 
it,” fifth-year midfielder Nicki 
Hernandez said.

Despite 
their 
dominance, 

Michigan was forced to enter a 
sudden death overtime period 
and face the possibility of losing 
its home field advantage in the 
conference tournament. 

This fear lasted exactly thirty 

seconds, 
before 
Hernandez 

charged down the left sideline and 
fired a shot from distance that flew 
into the right corner of the net over 
a diving Brucia, ending the game 
and giving Hernandez her sixth 
goal of the season and her first goal 
in 10 games.

Ironically, the shot that won the 

game for the Wolverines wasn’t 
even intended to be on net. 

“I was actually trying to cross 

it,” Hernandez said, “So it had 
a little bend into the goal, but it 
worked out.”

Much like Hernandez’s shot, 

the matchup didn’t go exactly 
as expected for Michigan. But 
worked out in the end, giving the 
Wolverines a boost heading into 
the postseason.

With the game fully in hand 

midway through the fourth quarter, 
the Michigan defense lined up for 
one last 4th-and-1. 

In a microcosm of Northwestern’s 

offense for the day, quarterback 
Carl Richardson fumbled the snap. 
Out of the ensuing scrum, senior 
edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson 
emerged with the ball, celebrating 
as if he’d just won the game for the 
Wolverines. 

The recovery, of course, had no 

impact on the game whatsoever. 
Michigan already led, 33-7 — which 
would ultimately be the final score 
— and the fumble occurring on 
fourth down meant the Wildcats 
couldn’t advance the ball anyway. 

But for Hutchinson, that didn’t 

matter. The recovery reflected 
his play on every down: fierce, 
unrelenting and mind-bogglingly 
quick for his size. His unique level 
of talent makes him a nightmare for 
any opposing offense, whether or 
not he’s actually dragging down the 
quarterback on any given down. 

Against Northwestern, that was 

no different. 

“I know he’s gonna be at the — 

you all know — he’s gonna be at the 
quarterback,” junior David Ojabo, 
Hutchinson’s counterpart on the 
edge, said. “ … It’s a lot of comfort 
having Aidan Hutchinson, knowing 
that he’s gonna do what Aidan 
Hutchinson does.”

For anyone watching the game, 

that impact is most clear when 

he’s in the backfield — and he’s in 
the backfield pretty often. On a 
third down in the second quarter, 
with the Wolverines nursing a 
seven-point 
lead, 
Hutchinson 

barrelled through the line and 
sacked Wildcats quarterback Ryan 
Hilinski, all while having one arm 

held by a blocker. 

But focus on Hutchinson every 

down, and his influence is equally 
visible even when he’s not making 
tackles. Much of that comes from 

effective scheming from Michigan’s 
coaching staff. 

Two plays before the sack, with 

Hutchinson on the weak side, 
Northwestern motioned two tight 
ends to try and flip sides. Hutchinson, 
given the trust of the coaching staff 
to adjust his own positioning, shifted 

back to the weak side, blew up a 
crack block and hurried a rolling-out 
Hilinski into a bad pass. The next 

play, the Wildcats rushed to the side 
opposite Hutchinson, right into the 
teeth of the defense. 

The rest of the Wolverines’ 

defense is tough enough to scheme 

against. 
It’s 
made 
infinitely 

more difficult when an athletic 
juggernaut 
like 
Hutchinson 
is 

waiting on one end of the line. 

“Making the ball come out quick 

is even more valuable than sacks 
a lot of the time,” Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said. “So you can’t 
just go by sacks — though he did 
have a sack and a fumble recovery — 
he’s making the ball come out fast, 
and imagine what that does for the 
secondary.”

It’s not hard to imagine, because 

it’s clear on every pass play. As 
Hutchinson 
continued 
to 
find 

the backfield on passing downs, 
Northwestern was forced to adjust 
to a much shorter, quicker passing 
game. Having the ball come out 
mere moments after the snap 
made it difficult for its receivers to 
create any separation and allowed 
the Wolverines’ defensive backs to 
anticipate where the ball would be. 

On 
junior 
cornerback 
D.J. 
Turner’s 

fourth quarter interception, that 
anticipation paid dividends. Hilinski 
tried to hit a receiver on a quick hitch 
route to the outside, where Turner 
— trusting that Hutchinson and the 
rest of Michigan’s pass rush could 
stop any deep balls before they were 
even thrown — was waiting to jump 
the route. 

“It makes it so much easier,” 

Turner said. “The ball has to come 
out quick. I know they don’t have all 
day in the pocket. Just like on the 
pick, it was a hitch, and I just know 
you can’t just sit in the pocket all day 
with Ojabo, and Aidan, and all kinds 
of dudes up there. A D-line is a DB’s 
best friend.”

In effect, fear of Hutchinson 

is almost as valuable a weapon as 
Hutchinson himself.

10 — Wednesday, October 27, 2021


On Monday, amidst a siege of 

questions about the impending clash 
between No. 6 Michigan and No. 8 
Michigan State, Jim Harbaugh largely 
resorted to a tried and true cliché.

“Those 
questions 
just 
answer 

themselves,” 
the 
Michigan 
coach 

repeatedly opined when pressed about 
the game’s importance. 

Harbaugh, albeit blunt, is correct; 

the implications of the game do speak 
for themselves. The winner will not 
only be rewarded with the upper-hand 
in a bitter in-state rivalry but will also 
be solidified as a legitimate College 
Football Playoff contender. Chances of a 
Big Ten Championship, too, grow more 
formidable. 

The loser, by contrast, is kicked to 

the curb, the feel-good mojo from an 
undefeated start all but dashed. 

Harbaugh knows this. And yet, 

despite his terse answers, he did break 
character when asked to articulate what 
a win over the Spartans would mean for 
the Wolverines’ postseason fate:

“It sure would give it a boost,” 

Harbaugh said with a chuckle. “You talk 
about winning the conference, winning 
the National Championship. It’s an 
elimination mindset, a playoff mindset 
at this point. Win this game and it will 
help your chances.” 

The answer speaks volumes about 

Michigan’s rapid ascension back into 
college football’s upper echelon. Just 
ten months ago, the Wolverines were 
wrapping up a disastrous 2-4 season 
amidst a COVID-19 outbreak while 
questions swirled around Harbaugh’s 
future and the general direction of the 
program. 

And now? Well, things have changed. 
“It could really help propel us through 

the rest of the season,” senior offensive 
tackle Ryan Hayes said about a potential 
victory. “We’ve got a few more tough 
games to prepare for. This could help us 
with our momentum and confidence for 
the rest of the season.” 

Hayes is among a contingent of 

Wolverines who are steeped in the 
culture of the rivalry. A Traverse City, 
MI, native, he has watched the game 
and rooted for Michigan since before 
he can remember. The same can be said 
for fifth-year linebacker Josh Ross, who 

hails from Southfield, MI, and watched 
his older brother, James III, lose to 
the Spartans three times during his 
Michigan tenure. 

At the same time, as a collective 

group, the current Wolverines have 
little rivalry experience. Last season, 
amidst the backdrop of a pandemic and 
inside an empty Michigan Stadium, the 
atmosphere was subdued. Michigan 
last visited East Lansing in 2018, when 
Hayes was a freshman who saw no game 
action and didn’t even make the trip. 

Nonetheless, 
fables 
and 
tales 

— everything from the trademark 
physicality to the intensity of the hour-
plus bus ride to Mike Hart’s infamous 
“little brother” quip — have made their 

way around the locker room. 

“There’s definitely been some 

talk about what it means to them,” 
sophomore 
running 
back 
Blake 

Corum said. “For the guys that 
haven’t played the game, the older 
guys will tell them what it’s like and 
what it means.

“… But right now, we’re just locking in 

on film and getting ready.” 

All season, the Wolverines have 

embraced a slogan imparted to them 
by linebackers coach George Helow: 
“nameless, faceless opponents.”

Back in September, for instance, 

sophomore 
receiver 
A.J. 
Henning 

referred to former teammate Giles 
Jackson as a “faceless opponent” ahead 
of the Washington game; while Jackson 

may be a confidant off the field, on it he is 
merely the opposition. 

Now more than ever, in the most 

pivotal game of the season, the refrain 
is applicable. Ross noted that this year’s 
matchup brings “new blood.” 

“It doesn’t matter who you’re going 

against, you’re just gonna give it your all 
and do your job and go get it,” he said.

And that’s why, in advance of 

Michigan State, Michigan is riding the 
same formula that has buoyed them to a 
7-0 start. If they deviate from it? “Lest a 
team be painfully humbled,” Harbaugh 
said. 

Ross added: “When you change how 

you prepare during the season, that’s a 
problem. We’ve been preparing the right 

way every week. This week, it definitely 
has higher stakes, but just attack it the 
same way.” 

Ross conducted his press conference 

with a palpable sense of energy. 
Harbaugh, too, exuded a certain 
eagerness; on two separate occasions, he 
noted his excitement “to get to practice 
and roll.” 

Certainly, the game’s implications 

play a factor in all of that. 

“Everything that we’ve done so far 

this season, going into Michigan State, 
beating them in their stadium, I think it 
would take our season to another level,” 
Corum said. 

As for the alternative? 
Well, 
to 
borrow 
Harbaugh’s 

vernacular, the question answers itself. 

‘Elimination mindset’: Michigan embracing 

high stakes ahead of MSU showdown

After a career of setbacks, D.J. Turner 

shines in starting role

EMMA MATI/Daily 

After a promising early career at Michigan, D.J. Turner has come into his own this season, making a key inter-
ception against Northwestern.

JARED GREENSPAN
Daily Sports Editor

Before this season, D.J. Turner 

had always been on the precipice.

Over the last few years, 

Turner’s name had been tossed 
around as a breakout candidate 
during the Michigan football 
team’s spring practices. Jim 
Harbaugh praised the young 
cornerback’s progress as an 
early enrollee and freshman in 
2019, but an injury sidelined him 
for much of the year. Turner 
made his first appearance in the 
secondary during the pandemic-
shortened 2020 season, though 
most of his action came on special 
teams once again.

But this season, the former 

three-star recruit is living up to 
the praise he’s collected for years. 
Through 
seven 
appearances, 

the junior has tallied 11 tackles, 
an interception and a pass 
breakup while holding his own in 
coverage.

“My sense is he’s always been 

great,” Harbaugh said Monday. 
“He’s always kind of been right 
there as a starting player and then 
had a setback … where he was 
working through something that 
slows him down. But he always 
battled right back. It’s great to see 
him peaking at a great time.”

During 
Saturday’s 

33-7 win over Northwestern, 
Turner’s late interception put 
an exclamation point on the 
Wolverines’ victory. After a pass 
to the sideline was tipped three 
times, Turner snagged it and took 
it the other direction, putting a 
circus pick on Michigan’s season 
highlight reel in the process.

Turner earned his first career 

start at No. 2 cornerback on 
Saturday over senior Gemon 
Green, who usually lines up 
opposite senior Vincent Gray 
to round out the Wolverines’ 
cornerback tandem. He played a 
career-high 43 snaps, earning a 
team-best 78.7 coverage grade on 
Pro Football Focus.

“He’s been battling the whole 

season,” junior safety Daxton 
Hill said Saturday. “This season, 
before the season, the spring. This 
has been a long year for him, and 
I’m proud of him for stepping up, 
making plays and helping out the 
defense.”

Prior to the interception, it 

was clear the Wildcats were 
making a conscious effort to 
target Turner. Northwestern 
quarterback 
Ryan 
Hilinksi 

threw his way multiple times in 
the first half but backed off after 
Turner blew up a screen pass in 
the backfield.

From start to finish, the strong 

performance caught Harbaugh’s 
eye.

“I thought he had a great 

game,” Harbaugh said Monday. 
“The interception, I think it’s one 
of the best I’ve seen all season 
in college football. Also really 
impressed with his physicality. 
He made some big tackles in the 
game, a tackle for loss (on) one of 
the screens Northwestern had 
run. Two of our guys had taken a 
bad angle and the ball got out, but 
he took a great angle, came from 
the other side of the field. He’s 
playing really good football. Great 
to see.”

As a recruit, Turner committed 

to Michigan just three days after 
taking his official visit to Ann 
Arbor. Hosted by linebacker Josh 
Ross, Turner’s visit sealed the 
deal ahead of his college pledge. 
Now a fifth-year senior, Ross has 
watched Turner grow from his 
initial arrival on campus.

So, it was only fitting that 

Ross became his lead blocker 
after his interception on Saturday.

“That’s a guy that always 

attacks everything the right 
way, works hard,” Ross said. “As 
I opened up from my drop and 
broke over and saw him get that 
tipped pick, I was just so happy 
for him. It was an amazing play 
and he’s going to continue to do 
big things for us and our defense.”

Going into this weekend against No. 8 Michigan State, the stakes are, as Jim Harbaugh 
knows, incredibly high.

Four years ago, I got an 

email from the Michigan State 
admissions office. Two weeks 
after I had applied, I had been 
accepted. 
At 

the 
moment, 

going to East 
Lansing wasn’t 
really on my 
radar. I applied 
because 
it 

was fun — my 
senior year of 
high 
school, 

I got into the 
bad 
habit 
of 

getting drunk and applying to 
bad schools for the validation.

As the year went on, though, 

I started seriously consider-
ing going to Michigan State. 
It seemed like a half-decent 
option, and hey, at some level, 
it’s about what you make out 
of your education and not the 

quality of the education itself.

I wouldn’t be a student jour-

nalist if I went to Michigan 
State. I wouldn’t have covered 
women’s basketball or gone 
to Omaha to cover the men’s 
College World Series if I went 
there. I’m a computer science 
major, not a journalism major, 
and I’ve never been interested 
in a career in journalism.

Every year in these dueling 

columns, the State News writer 
comes out and exclaims, “We’re 
better than you because we 
have a journalism school.” They 
even started the jabs a little 
early this year, so I imagine this 
dig will make up most of their 
column, with Adam Schefter at 
the center of it.

First off, Michigan did have 

a journalism program when 
Schefter 
went 
here. 
Luck-

ily, your alumni were quick to 

help you on that point. He also 
went to Medill for grad school. 
Perhaps he learned to send his 
stories to the subject for edits 
in a class similar to JRN 200, 
“Writing and Reporting News,” 
in a J-School.

Or maybe he learned it in 

a class similar to JRN 317, 
“Sports Journalism.” Or JRN 
418, “Advanced Sports Report-
ing.” Two very valuable classes 
for your staff members to take, 
since they don’t seem to do 
much decent sports journalism 
for the State News.

You do realize that Michigan 

State has a field hockey team, 
right? You’ve written three sto-
ries about the team since 2017. 

I get it, you have a small staff. 

I’m actually impressed that you 
have enough people to cover 
men’s and women’s soccer reg-
ularly, as well as volleyball. I’m 

happy to see that you’ve come 
out of the pandemic with a big-
ger staff, eager to cover as much 
as possible.

Yet since The Daily allows 

any “riff raff off the street” to 
write for us, while the State 
News is competitive and its 
members go through the rigor-
ous academic course load con-
sisting of the classes “Advanced 
Reporting” and “Journalism 
History,” you’d think the sports 
you do write about would have 
high-quality articles.

If that were true, then why 

do sentences like this, “Tucker 
is free to leave if he wants if he 
is offered something that he 
deems as undeniable,” make the 
cut? And how come you don’t 
know the difference between 
an em dash (—) and hyphen 
(-), leading to this monstrously 
confusing sentence, “Cole said 
the development of the unit 
on sheer repetition-and the 
blind hope that it’ll work-and 
is optimistic production from 
their two power-play units will 
continue to trend in the right 
direction.”

But I get it, editing is hard. 

You can see that in all your 
past Dueling Columns, when 

for some reason you thought 
it was okay to publish this line 
in 2014: “Outside of sports, our 
parties are louder, our women 
are prettier.” Or publish this in 
2013: “Like the females in Ann 
Arbor, the past isn’t as glam-
orous when you take a longer 
look.”

The State News’ shortcom-

ings don’t stop with just your 
editing skills: Your website 
blows up the images to the point 
where they’re grainier than one 
of your agriculture labs. When I 
showed one of the photos to our 
assistant photo editors with no 
context, she just said, “Is there 
anything better than that? It’s 
not very interesting.” 

And when I showed the photo 

and quote to one of our manag-
ing photo editors, she said the 
assistant editor was being very, 
incredibly nice. I’ll save you 
from hearing the rest of her 
quote because I’m not sure your 
inferiority complex can take it.

But your website’s prob-

lems go even further than that. 
When you load an article, you 
see a Dune ad. Right beneath an 
even larger ad. Once you scroll 
down, you finally get to the 
article. 

Great, an ad with an arti-

cle attached to it. Just what I 
wanted to read. Even our old 
website, which you creatively 
attacked year after year after 
year, wasn’t that bad. By the 
way, did you see who won an 
online Pacemaker this year?

It’s cute that you’re finally 

practicing for the game. Maybe 
your #MarginalGains will get 
you to the point where you lose 
8-1, instead of 8-0. Maybe you 
won’t have to weather accu-
sations of not trying. Maybe 
you’ll still get that keg for sim-
ply scoring on us. Maybe you’ll 
actually tweet a story from 
your sports account, some-
thing you haven’t done since 
Oct. 8. 

On Friday, when we beat you 

for the 16th time in a row in a 
touch football game one of your 
past editors said “quite honest-
ly, I couldn’t care less about,” it 
won’t be because we have any 
riff-raff from the street on our 
staff. 

It’ll be because we’re better 

than you — at journalism and 
touch football.

Fourteen years ago, Mike Hart stood 

behind a podium wearing a Block-M 
quarter-zip 
after 
beating 
Michigan 

State 28-24. He smirked; shrugged, then 
laughed. His “little brother” quote, now 
infamous, has become ingrained in the 
rhetoric of the rivalry.

This weekend on Oct. 30, Hart 

will return to East Lansing as the 
running backs coach for the undefeated 
Wolverines. Michigan State also remains 
unbeaten, making this the first time 
since 1964 both teams play each other 
while ranked in the top 10. That year, No. 
4 Michigan beat No. 9 Michigan State, 
17-10. 

Now, the sixth-ranked Wolverines will 

play their toughest game of the season 
against the eighth-ranked Spartans. 

Throughout the year, those watching 
have speculated on how its performance 
against lesser opponents will golf up 
against more noteworthy opponents 
throughout the last five weeks of the 
regular season.

It’s the same story for the Spartans. 

Just like Michigan, neither have played 
against a team currently ranked in the 
top 25, and yet both are among the nine 
remaining undefeated teams, each with 
legitimate College Football Playoff hopes. 

Michigan State comes in with an 

explosive offense, led by running back 
Kenneth Walker III who tops the nation 
in rushing yards per game. It has three 
wide receivers — Jalen Nailor, Tre Mosley 
and Jayden Reed — who average over 15 
yards a catch, each with more than 20 
catches on the season.

For reference, the Wolverines don’t 

have a single player with more than 20 
catches this season. It does, however, 

have two top-50 running backs in 
rushing yards per game. And, as a unit, 
the running backs room out rushed the 
Spartans by more than 300 yards this 
season. 

But the Spartans’ weapons strike at 

a weakness of the Michigan defense 
that first revealed its flaw three weeks 
ago against Nebraska. The Cornhuskers 
totaled eight plays of 20-plus yards against 
Michigan, consisting of more than half 
their yards over the game. Northwestern’s 
one touchdown, meanwhile, came on a 
75-yard touchdown run. 

Michigan State has 38 plays of 20-plus 

yards on the season and nine plays 
of 50-plus yards, good for fifth in the 
nation. 

And then there’s Michigan’s offense, 

much-maligned amongst the fanbase. No, 
freshman J.J. McCarthy will not be the 
quarterback, for better or worse. Junior 
Cade McNamara will game-manage an 

offense that is led by running backs Blake 
Corum and Hassan Haskins and if the 
defense limits big plays, the game will 
be decided by one of those two running 
backs. 

At least, that’s what we think. The past 

two months have merely been a rehearsal 
for Saturday and November, with 
Washington and Wisconsin not being the 
measuring sticks we expected. A game 
against top-10 Michigan State may go 
along the script we expect, or it may not. 
McNamara could make plays and blow 
the game wide open, or he may be taken 
aback by the most hostile environment he 
has ever played in.

Either way, the game will act as an all-

important barometer going forward. It’s 
a test that will measure the capability of 
the entire team and the coach at the helm.

Jim Harbaugh, whose proverbeal seat 

has considerably cooled in this season’s 
first seven weeks, will coach in a pivotal 

game against a rival. Can he dispell the 
narrative of struggling against rivals and 
struggling in big away games? Or by 4 
pm on Saturday, will one more game be 
added as an indictment against him?

“All focus is there,” Harbaugh said 

after the Northwestern game. “When 
you walk through that door I am going to 
answer some questions about this game, 
but it’s on to that game right now.”

Throughout the last eight weeks of 

Michigan’s schedule, more questions 
have been asked than opportunities to 
answer them. The team has an identity, a 
solid foundation. 

On Saturday, we will know if that 

foundation is strong enough to support a 
potential playoff push. 

Or if the “little brother” can knock it 

over like a sand castle.

HALLOWEEN 

EDITION


It was a typical Friday night on Maynard Street. 
My roommate and I had just finished up with 
a week of online classes from within our sublet 
apartment. Still in the heart of the pandemic, 
we acquired it immediately after University of 
Michigan President Mark Schlissel notified us 
that the dorms would be changing to single-
occupancy residency.

Our freshman year of college had so far been 

tumultuous, unpredictable, suffocating and 
monotonous all at once. We were always on our 
toes, waiting for the next bad thing to happen, 
while simultaneously exhausted by staring at the 
same four walls day-in, day-out. 

Plagued by our boredom, we began a tradition 

that would ground us while simultaneously 
exciting us, drawing us out of our repetitive 
routine and allowing us to escape our less-than-
perfect circumstances.

Every Friday night, my roommate and I 

immersed ourselves in horror movies.

We began the tradition in the dorms the night 

before Halloween and brought our obsession 
with us into the winter semester. We had both 
loved horror movies before college, yet the 
stimulation of watching these films became more 
of a restorative experience in 2020 rather than 
mindless entertainment. It was an escape from 
reality, a controlled, thrilling environment that 
captivated us.

My fascination with horror grew exponentially 

throughout my COVID-19 freshman year. Each 
day I listened to true crime and fantastical horror 
podcasts while washing dishes or working out. 
I binge-watched every season of “American 
Horror Story” while falling asleep. My constant 
engagement with the horror genre made me 
progressively more desensitized to the content 
of the stories; at this point, it takes an incredibly 

creative director or writer to get a genuine 

fearful 
reaction 
from 
me. 
My 

roommate and I are always 

searching for a film 

that 

will truly scare us to the core, a narrative that 
will shock us out of the real world and leave us 
haunted. 

Some might find this almost therapeutic 

perception of horror strange, or even disturbing. 
Horror movies allow me to focus on someone 
else’s world. In a strange way, their tragic 
circumstances 
make 
our 
own 
real-world 

problems seem manageable. But though there 
are numerous die-hard horror fans, others see 
no appeal in voluntarily igniting feelings of fear, 
disgust or dread. Why do some love this rush of 
adrenaline, while others avoid it at all costs? Why 
do certain individuals have such a high threshold 
of fear that even the most gruesome films elicit no 
reaction?

The Halloween season forces us to reflect on 

these questions and the curiosity surrounding 
fear as a whole. The fact that we allot a whole 
month to the concept of “spookiness” and horror 
certainly indicates a collective attraction to the 
idea of fright. Going into October, I wanted to 
understand this allure of the eerie, the creepy and 
the ghastly that movies present to us. Whether we 
like it or not, horror surrounds us during the fall, 
and horror films are ever an essential component 
of this spine-chilling period. 
D

issecting a Horror Movie

Horror movies are characterized 

by their ability to create an ambiance 

of uncertainty, eliciting feelings of suspense, 
disgust, shock or terror. According to AMC, 
horror capitalizes on “whatever dark, primitive, 
and revolting traits that simultaneously attract 
and repel us,” tapping into the twisted allure of 
unthinkably heinous circumstances. Viewers are 
drawn in by a collective fascination with brutality 
and a peculiar gratification that they are not 
experiencing similar atrocity in their own lives. 

The human interest in the macabre is not 

new. Horror has been around for centuries, 
evidenced by the more morbid stories from 
folklore or popular 19th-century gothic novels 
from Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley. Directors 
have been producing films that cater to this 

feeling of terror almost since 

the beginning of the movie 
industry. Since then, horror 
has developed into eight 
different 
sub-genres 
— 

psychological, slasher, gore, 
body horror, found footage, 
monster, paranormal and 
comedy — that approach 
the category from a distinct 
perspective. 
The 
movies 

amplify different types of 
fears so each consumer can 
obtain a thrilling experience 
fitting to their idea of what’s 
terrifying. 

This is what makes my 

horror-going 
experiences 

so intriguing. Whether I 

wish to experience a succession 

of quick jump scares or evoke a lasting 
psychological paranoia, horror has the 
capacity to cater to whatever effect I 
want to incite.

The diversity of the genre also makes 

it a unique tool for artistic expression. 
Horror explores the most appalling 

parts of humanity, the roots of our fears and 
worries, and reflects the state of society. Take 
the example of the U.S. in the 1970s: Serial killer 
murder rates were the highest they’d ever been in 
the country’s history. Not coincidentally, slasher 
films became a cinematic staple, presenting 
viewers with a heightened production of the 
reality they were living in. Jordan Peele’s 2017 
film “Get Out” explores the deep roots of racism in 
America while social justice movements became 
more visible in real-life mainstream media. The 
visual effects of horror thrills audiences, but 
witnessing a twisted version of the issues of one’s 
own world is what’s truly terrifying.

Mark Kligerman, a lecturer in the LSA 

Department of Film, Television and Media, 
emphasized the importance of this cultural 
component of horror.

“Each time I revisit the genre in the classroom, 

I ask students to tease out relationships between 
horror movies and the broader system of values 
that form the basis of culture, both domestically 
and internationally,” Kligerman said.

Kligerman also urges students to, “focus on the 

fluidity of the form” of horror, paying attention 
to how directors adapt their films over time to 
reflect current society.

“The original ‘Halloween,’ for example, 

premiered in 1978, yet Hollywood has produced 
countless sequels, remakes and knockoffs 
since then,” Kligerman said. “Though the film 
certainly belongs to the same genre as the 
original superficially, its attitudes toward politics, 
violence, sexuality and even monstrosity are 
much different, alerting us to the very dynamic 
and unstable nature of horror. Recognizing and 
delving into this instability with students is when 
discussions of the form become really interesting.”

Kligerman highlighted the revealing nature 

of horror films, whether in the U.S. or abroad. 
These movies, he explained, spotlight the central 
issues and philosophies of each culture in a more 
poignant manner than other genres.

“I do tend to stress the importance of cultural 

specificity when teaching horror,” Kligerman said. 
He cited Vanderbilt professor Teresa A. Goddu, who 
he says argues “that the gothic narrative in early 
American literature was a resistant cultural form 
that unsettled myths of New World innocence by 
revealing the darkness at the heart of the American 
civilizing process: the trans-Atlantic slave trade 
and the legacy of racial exploitation and exclusion 
have formed the basis of a living nightmare that has 
haunted American culture for centuries and from 
which we have yet to awaken.”

Diving into the world of horror films with my 

roommate was simultaneously an act of escapism 
and an ongoing education on the history of the 
world around us. Sexism, health, violence, racism, 
family and mental health — we explored all of 
these issues in horror while they reached a fever 
pitch in the events and movements occurring 
outside of our apartment walls. 

We immersed ourselves in fantastic tales that 

magnified the problems of disease, environmental 
collapse and political division plaguing our world. 
Through film, the issues were easier to absorb, 
allowing us to examine their truths as outsiders to 
the unfolding events. While the sensational effects 
of horror were upfront and at times extreme, we 
internalized themes that addressed some of the 
largest and darkest issues haunting humankind.

F

ear and How We Deal With It

Though many directors use horror 

movies as a medium for expressing 

important ideas, the main draw for audiences is the 
thrill of its content — the unexpected and extreme 
events that make up the plot.

“What is perhaps the primary appeal of the 

horror genre,” Kligerman said, “is its ability to wreak 
havoc on our emotional equilibrium… Charting 
(discrepancies) in affective response is in itself 
fundamental to the work of genre analysis and 
raises critical questions concerning the nature of 
spectatorial desire and pleasure.”

There is obviously an overlap between the fear 

response and more pleasurable emotions, such as 
“desire” and positive excitement. It’s the reason that 
my roommate and I can’t wait for our Friday horror 
nights and why audiences flood to theaters when 
a new movie is released. Dr. Kent Berridge, U-M 
professor of psychology and neuroscience, explained 
the connection between these vastly different 
reactions and their shared origin in the amygdala, a 
brain structure responsible for emotion recognition.

“Fear, of course, can be a very terrible 

experience,” Berridge said. “But the kind of fear 
where people are actually kind of chasing horror 
movies or roller-coaster experiences, there’s a 
kind of active fear connected to the dopamine 
reward system.”

Berridge outlined how in this “reward system,” 

certain “cues or sights or images” will incite the 
urge to react to the reward. For example, “when 
you’re thirsty for something, water” provokes your 
urge to drink. These cues are equally important in 
fear as they are in desire.

“Just like the reward cues are attention riveting, 

a threatening percept is also attention riveting,” 
Berridge said. “It’s hard not to look at it, but it’s in 
a threatening way, not in an attractive way. It’s so 
attention-grabbing it has to mean something, it’s 
motivationally significant.” 

People are so attracted to horror movies 

because the brain’s responses to both fear and 
desire share the same chemical and psychological 
components involved in emotional processing.

“(It’s possible) to flip back and forth between 

fear and desire,” Berridge said. “In the lab, we can 
create this, and it may be that in the roller coaster 
and in the horror movie, the situation is scary but 
it’s under control. Part of you knows that, and 
so you can oscillate and enjoy the oscillation in 
the overlap. It’s sort of counterintuitive that fear 
would overlap with desire, but it does, and that 
may be one reason why people can seek out fearful 
experiences that scare them just enough.”

For many, there’s a fine line between finding 

stimulation that “scares them just enough” and 
those that put them over the edge in terror. There 
are personal discrepancies that prevent some from 
indulging in activities like horror films, while others 
with high thresholds for fear actively seek out these 
experiences. Individual distinctions, according 
to Berridge, arise from certain personality traits 
such as thrill-seeking, which draws people to these 
rousing attractions.

Some people are simply more likely to enjoy 

horror and other heart-racing attractions. My 
own thrill-seeking character explains why I 
search regularly for the ideal horror film that will 
astound me with its ghastly content.

O

n Halloween, we eat dinner early. The 
setting sun beams in through the front 
windows as we form a line around the 

kitchen counter, our paper plates eager to touch 
the hot pizza. We scarf down the necessary carbs 
while sitting in whatever clothing will lie under-
neath our costumes.

A lot has led up to this moment. Anticipa-

tion clung to the air like fine mist when we were 
at school a few hours before. Mentions of route 
plans, candy bars of choice and costumes fluttered 
between our mouths. And even though there 
were no Halloween celebrations allowed in class, 
the end of the day bell would turn us all loose to be 
anything we wanted to be. 

The magic of this feeling waned as we grew 

older. Young adulthood morphed trick-or-treating 
into oblivion, and the sweet hoards of chocolate 
from the morning after soured into math tests on 
Nov. 1. But as kids, the only thing we cared to count 
was the KitKats and Twizzlers that made their 
way into orange sacks, before being unwrapped 
and indulged over the following days, all because 
we wore a costume to someone’s front door.

Dressing up used to be the trickiest part of 

Halloween for me. My mom sewed me a Dalma-
tian costume when I was in first grade, which 
was reused with love in many years to follow 
due to its soft limbs and my inability to think of 
anything else. The getup was easily confused for 
a cow, but that didn’t matter: It was Halloween 
and I was something that wasn’t me. Over the 
years my costume choices were only made in 
order to clear the various hurdles the night pre-
sented. Bat costume? The headpiece is too hot. 
Sheet ghost? Prepare to trip and not be able to 
see half the night. Dalmatian. Didn’t you wear 
that last year?

It was in eighth grade that I finally found my 

costume niche. I deconstructed the box of our 
television, painting both sides in corporate red 
with white block lettering, with nutrition facts 
and ingredients on the back. Using duct tape 
straps to join the two panels over my shoulders, I 
became a KitKat. I received more of the chocolate 
wafer candy that year than any other. My knees 
rammed into the front piece of cardboard as we 
darted across neighborhood lawns, slick with the 
dew of dusk, but it was breathable, movable and 
undeniably recognizable. 

My cardboard creations only diversified from 

there. I was an iPhone (the paper app icons slid 
off the costume in the October rain), an Oreo (a 
hamburger to some eyes) and one year I created 
my magnum opus: a Christmas tree. Two trian-
gular cardboard pieces painted green, silver tinsel 
cascaded down each side and multi-colored lights 
bedazzled the front. I was the brightest, most rec-
ognizable, yet most seasonally out-of-place item 
on the Halloween streets. 

I dressed up as these objects for fun; painting 

and gluing and taping were much more enjoyable 
activities to take part in than studying, reading or 
writing for school. However, this was done out of 
necessity as well. It was around my sophomore 
year of high school that I had ascended to my cur-
rent height of 6 feet 3 inches. Creative, recogniz-
able dress-up was the only way I could dodge the 
criticism that spit from the mouths of the adults 
who passed out candy. 

“You’re a tall one.” “You’re so grown up!” 

Passive-aggressive comments paused at the topic 
of height, though others’ words ventured farther 
into the evening dark. “Aren’t you a little old for 
this?” “I didn’t realize you were trick-or-treating.” 
Candy that would flow into my brother’s sack 
would only trickle into mine. It was easy to take 
the subtle hints personally. Why was I running 
from house to house, begging for candy? Wasn’t 
there anything better that I was supposed to be 
doing, now that I was 15? 
I

n high school, Halloween was associated 
with parties. Our school’s annual Hallow-
een Dance blasted “Spooky Scary Skeletons” 

into the lower gym. Students showed up drunk 
on boxed wine or became sugared up on sher-
bert punch, dodging eye contact with teachers 
that had graded our homework hours before. We 
danced with adequate enthusiasm and talked to 
the people we needed to before going home to a 
friend’s house, forgetting the haunted mediocrity 
of what we just experienced. Trick-or-treat was 
out of the picture, and partying in groups was 
popular. It was part of growing up.

There’s pressure on high school students to 

forgo traditions of childhood and prepare them-
selves for the transition to adulthood. The resi-
dents behind the front doors I trick-or-treated at 
thought I should be studying for a test, hanging 
out with friends my own age or sitting at home, 
pretending to have something to do. The desire 
to grow older extended itself to school. Seventh 
graders were taken on tours of colleges, students 
took quizzes to determine their future career and 

summers were to be spent at academic programs. 
What is the purpose of ending childhood so early? 
Why are high schoolers now pushed away from 
the experiences that defined their youth, and 
towards ones that will undermine it?
D

espite these pressures, I went trick-or-
treating one last time in my senior year of 
high school, on the edge of 17. Earlier that 

day, I brought my costume, a refrigerator, to school 
as a part of our band’s participation in the next-
door elementary school’s Halloween Parade. The 
mechanics of the fridge costume were the most 
complex yet: The front consisted of two cardboard 
pieces, bound together with plastic screws which 
created a fridge door that opened to reveal photo 
cutouts of fruit, ketchup and assorted perish-
ables. On the inside of the door panel, the message 
Happy Halloween! was painted in black tempera 
paint. I opened the costume to reveal the interior 
food and message, and won first prize in my high 
school band’s costume competition. I hoped my 
good fortune would carry into the night. 

As per tradition, we ate pizza at our neighbor’s 

house a few blocks away — the slices shining in 

the waning autumn light, and the napkins ready 
to capture any runaway sauce from our mouths. 
Parents commented on how it was my last Hal-
loween, and there was nothing more I could do 
but smile and nod in acknowledgment. With this 
bittersweet atmosphere, the duct tape straps that 
held my refrigerator to my shoulders had an addi-
tional heaviness given the weight of my final trick-
or-treat. And as I collected myself and the rest of 
my things, little kids, 5 or 6 years old, had started 
to roam the streets, getting a head start on candy 
collecting before the fall of night. They came up 
to the front door of my neighbor’s, and I dropped 
sweets into their hands. I looked into their eyes 
and saw my former self, at once so different in age, 
yet driven by the same desire for candy. My own 
crew assembled. I was the oldest, with everyone 
else two to six years younger. We promptly closed 
the door, yelled for our parents to follow and set 
out on our own trick-or-treat journey.

The sidewalks of our suburban neighborhood 

were wet from the season’s first snowfall hours 
before, and the yellow leaflets that stuck to it mir-
rored the streetlights and stars above. Like moths, 
we darted across yards seeking the front porches’ 
warm glow, an oasis of calm and chocolate. Each 
house had its living rooms illuminated, open for 
viewing from the outside world. We remembered 
neighbors from years past but didn’t dare say their 
names, identities blurred by various disguises; 
only the confection transactions really mat-
tered. We saw into their lives through dogs bark-
ing in the background, television screens aglow, 
hardwood floors littered with pairs of shoes and 
shouts to the back in need of candy refills. Any 
attempts to see into our identities were foiled with 
our disguises. Sure, some noticed the refrigerator 
was quite tall, and maybe thought a refrigerator 
shouldn’t be trick-or-treating at that age. But, I 
was too busy yelling “trick or treat!”, crowding 
porch steps and slipping on wet grass to care.

The porch lights turned off at 8 o’clock, and we 

walked home, noting the heaviness of our bags. 
We reconvened in the living room, sorting and 
ranking candy. Our chocolate constellations shift-
ed and changed constantly with trades — M&M’s 
whizzing across the room like meteorites, Snick-
ers exchanged for Twizzlers and laughs. Soon, 
we were reminded of school the next morning, 
and our parents escorted us back to our respec-
tive homes. My brother and I’s faces soaked up the 
October night, and each step towards our front 
door put us closer to going to bed. We arrived 
home, and I still had math homework to do. I 
counted my KitKats, I counted how many cal-
culus problems I had left to solve. Now I count 
the years since my last trick-or-treat, wondering 
if any Halloween will live up to the simple joy of 
running in the dark, looking for fructose, finding 
friendship.

Content warning: Gender-based violence
O

ctober is a month of thrilling traditions. 

Smiling pumpkins carved with love, 

horror movies viewed from a comfort-

able couch, coffee filled with the overwhelming 
sweetness of pumpkin spice. 

Like Starbucks pumpkin cream cold brews, 

my excitement had been brewing long before the 
calendar pages turned. I even had a reminder set 
for Oct. 1 reminding myself to plan my Halloween 
costumes. We were deciding between hippies and 
princesses.

Yet, on a bright and warm Oct. 2, as my friends 

and I paraded through the fall wonderland of the 
Ann Arbor Farmers Market in Kerrytown, terror 
quickly began to messily weave its way through 
the Ann Arbor community. 

First, it was in our sorority GroupMe. Then 

a friend’s private story. Then a club Slack chan-
nel. Eventually, a campus-wide email. Genuine, 
uncertain fear ran through every vein of our cam-
pus as the threat spread like a flaming, destructive 
wildfire.

“On October 4th, I’m going to the University 

of Michigan and blow away every single woman 
I see with an AR-15,” the now-deleted post read. 
“There is a violent pro-male revolution coming 
and you people better get ready for it.”

This message was originally posted on a Rus-

sian anonymous confession website called Sinn 
List, inaccessible to typical search engine users. 
The idea of the site was that people could profess 

their most twisted, disgusting opinions, and other 
users could approve or disapprove by responding 
with either a right side up or upside-down cross.

At the start of a month meant for the controlled, 

detached fearfulness of horror movies and haunt-
ed houses, we suddenly faced real, pervasive fear. 
As a reproductive rights rally marched through 
the streets of Ann Arbor, darkness began to spread 
around campus in the form of a misogynistic blog-
ger professing intent to eradicate our female pop-
ulation.

By 5 p.m. on that gloomy Saturday, the FBI 

interviewed a resident of the home from which 
the threat was posted. Based on their investiga-
tion, they said, “there (was) nothing to indicate 
imminent harm to our community.”

On Sunday, University President Mark Schlis-

sel announced that classes and activities would 
take place “as scheduled” on Monday, regardless 
of significant concerns and the creation of a peti-
tion with over 1,200 signatures. And while some 
professors did opt to make their Monday classes 
remote, others did not, with these decisions made 
on a professor-by-progressor basis. 

With no campus-wide accommodations on 

that Monday, many women were given no choice 
but to place themselves in the uncomfortable posi-
tion of walking around a campus painted with a 
potential death threat. Regardless of the Univer-
sity’s vague claim of mitigation, it seemed as if 
very little g was done to increase student safety as 
we were forced to go about our lives as planned. 

It seemed as if the University had decided that 
ensuring students took their chemistry exams as 
scheduled was more important than the comfort 
of the people who keep the campus alive.

If we have learned anything in the trauma of 

the last two years, it should be that student health, 
mental and physical, should come before the rigid 
scheduling and workload of college academics. 
As if the laughable wellness days and month-long 
Counseling and Psychological Services waitlists 
weren’t enough, the way the University handled 
this threat surely cemented to me that student 
well-being is not high enough on their list of pri-
orities.

The day was relatively normal, aside from the 

fact that campus hadn’t felt emptier since the peak 
of the pandemic. After hours of internal debate, 
I decided to go to the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library to get some work done. After about an 
hour, I noticed that I did not see a single other 
woman throughout the entirety of the somewhat 
crowded third floor. 
A

s the afternoon came to a close, my 
friends and I sat in our living room and 
haphazardly wondered what the f*ck 

we were supposed to do next. Sure, the threat 
said there would be a shooting on Oct. 4. But what 
was stopping the poster, or anyone for that mat-
ter, from coming the day after? Or the day after 
that? What is the University doing to protect the 
women on their campus beyond the moments 
when they are forced to act? 

In a nation with poorly limited gun control 

and relentless violence against women, we are 
forced to deal with these terrifying realities as 
we go about our daily lives. Fear is unlimited, 
constantly lurking far beyond the constraints 
of an annual October rewatch of “Friday the 
13th.” Halloween may last a mere 24 hours, but 
real fear is not confined to an elaborate dress-up 
holiday.

In some ways, we have come to accept much 

of the impending danger we may face. It can be 
extremely beneficial to live effortlessly, refusing 
to allow the sheer risk of being alive to waste our 
lives away. But when situations like this arise, 
our very real fears waste away into passive igno-
rance. After Monday, Oct. 4, there was no more 
talk about the threat or its implications. The 
dreaded day had passed, and we were supposed-
ly free to continue on with our lives as if nothing 
had ever happened. Because, technically, I guess, 
it didn’t. 

Sadly, the next time we will have anything 

close to a major campus discussion about women’s 
safety will probably be the next time we receive a 
threat of this nature. We are all too good at ignor-
ing societal ills until they are staring us dead in the 
eyes and we are no longer physically able to look 
away. It is a staring contest that we are almost 
always losing. The immediacy of our fear sub-
sides, and issues no longer deemed “timely” fall to 
the wayside until they inevitably circle back to our 
focus once again.
