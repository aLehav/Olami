City Council scraps plantcut

Residents, council
members say lights
necessary for safety
By NATHAN RANNS
For the Daily
City Council members recently
voted to repeal plans to turn off

nearly 17 percent of city street-
lights after facing complaints from
a significant number of concerned
citizens who were involved in a
neighborhood-specific pilot pro-
gram.
The pilot program was imple-
mented to gauge residents'
response to the reduced lighting,
which aimed to save the city about
$120,000, according to Council-

member Christopher Taylor (D-
Ward 3). After receiving several
complaints from affected residents
and walking on the corridors with
unlit streets alongside residents,
Taylor and Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje sponsored a motion to call
off plans to expand the reduced
lighting throughout the city at a
meeting earlier this month.
City officials determined how

on a standard passed in 1970 that
determined the minimum amount
of lighting necessary for safely
operating vehicles. But after talk-

there's more than just vehicular
safety that must be taken into con-
sideration.

Two rifles but no ticket: Man may
face charges for Big House entry

National Guard
member allegedly
lied to security to get
into MSU game
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
A National Guard member could
soon face charges after he gained
entry to the Big House during the
Michigan State game without a
ticket.
University Police confirmed that
the 42-year-old man parked a mili-
tary vehicle near the field, while
dressed in a full military honor
guard uniform and armed with
two rifles without any ammunition,

AnnArbor.com reported.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily that police did check the
man's weapons when he parked at
the Department of Public Safety
building on Kipke Drive by the sta-
dium to make sure he didn't present
any danger to spectators.
Brown said honor guard mem-
bers and their commanders raise
and lower the flag on field at every
home game, according to AnnAr-
bor.com. Because officers at the
Public Safety building do not have
a list of honor guard members per-
mitted on the field, the man was
able to gain entry as he was dressed
in the honor guard uniform.
In the interview with the Daily,
Brown also said that the man told

several officers at several different
checkpoints that he was authorized
to be on the field.
Once at the stadium, the man
entered through the tunnel to
gain access to the field, Brown told
AnnArbor.com.
After another honor guard mem-
ber told security officials that the
man was not authorized to partici-
pate in the ceremony, University
Police escorted the man out of the
stadium during the game.
Brown told the Daily that the
man was "very compliant" and told
police he made his way onto the
field in uniform because he could
not geta ticket.
Though the man's name has not
been released, Brown told AnnAr-
bor.com he is in a National Guard

The University of Michigan
Engineering Council hosted a
town hall meeting at the Lurie
Engineering Center last night
that featured discussion on the

importance of establishing a posi-
tive social climate on campus and
increasing tolerance among stu-
dents.
A panel of University officials
opened the program, including
Jim Toy, a leading gay rights activ-
ist in the state and co-founder of
what is now called the Spectrum
Center, Director of the Office of
Services for Students with Dis-
abilities Stuart Segal, Associate
Dean of the College of Engineer-
ing James Holloway, and Direc-
tor of the Center for Engineering
Diversity and Outreach Robert

Scott. The group spoke to a crowd
of about 75 students about increas-
ing diversity on campus and then
opened up the floor for questions.
In light of recent incidences
of bullying against LGBT young
people, including Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly President Chris
Armstrong, Toy spoke about why
the Spectrum Center is a crucial
tool for gay, lesbian and trans-
gendered students on campus. As
a co-founder, Toy helped launch
the center - which was called the

By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
This year marks the fifth anni-
versary of the University's Michi-
gan in Washington program, but

the anniversary isn't a milestone
organizers necessarily expected
when the program first launched.
The University's contract with
the University of California to lease
housing in Washington D.C. only
stretched five years, but officials
were able to renew the contract
last year until 2014 thanks to the
sustained success of the program.
A fifth anniversary celebration is
scheduled in Washington D.C. this
weekend.
Michigan in Washington sends

approximately 50 University
undergraduate students from all
majors to intern and take courses
in Washington D.C. each semester.
While in D.C., students take 12 to 15
credit hours and work in an intern-
ship position of their choosing.
Tracey Baetzel, the Michigan
in Washington program coordina-
tor, said through the ability to pick
their own internships, students are
able to create their own path within
the program.

Dedicated to Detroit

By teaching young people that
reading can be fon, WeRead - a
Universicy studenc organization
- is helping Detroit-area youth
develop skills in reading, commu-
nication and creativity.
The club, which has about 10 to
15 dedicated memheru, commuteu
to Detroit each week to read and
bond with elementary school stu-
dents. Members of the club can also
choose to write oi design aspects
of their very own children's hooks,
which if selected as the best in the
group, are mass-produced at the
end of the school year for Detroit
students.
Business junior Ciera Rickman
said contrary to structured tutor-
ing, the commuting members focus
on allowing the students to enjoy
themselves. This is often achieved
through reading comprehension
activities that give young students
the opportunity to demonstrate

their creativity.
"Our mission is to make things
fun," said Rickman, who is one of
the club's members. "We want to
get (kids) excited about reading,"
Rickman said the group's work
is paying off, adding that she has
seen kids choose reading over
activities that are often thought to
be more enjoyable, like watching
movies or playing games.
Each week, classes of about 35
to 40 children are broken up into
groups of four to six students, and
these small groups are paired with
mentors who encourage everyone
to read aloud. After finishing a
story, the group participates in a
meaningful comprehension activ-
ity.
Participation from every stu-
dent in the group is important,
Rickman added.
"We encourage the kids to help
each other," she said.

This year, che group plans to vol-
unteer at the Henderson Academy
in Detroit, With support from the
school's principal, Rickman said
the group may be able to extend
the amount of time it spends at the
school each week.
A second division of the club
called FUSION also has plans to
expand its influence, Rickman
said. Members of FUSION par-
ticipate in creative writing activi-
ties with older students, and this
semester, FUStON plans to work
with a wider variety of grade lev-
els.
Rickman said she has been par-
ticularly proud of the progress that
WeRead has already made, which
she described as "astounding."
"Last year, over 90 percent of
our students were on the honor roll
after we were done working with
them," she said.

WASHINGTON
* Gov't. pledges $773
million to former
GM site clean-up
The Obama administration has
reached a deal on a $773 million
environmental trust, the largest of
its kind in U.S. history, to clean up
dozens of former General Motors
sites spread over 14 states, officials
said yesterday.
The funds will target automotive
sites containing hazardous waste
that were left shuttered by the auto
giant's bankruptcy last year. About
half of the 89 sites covered by the
trust are in Michigan and others
are in Indiana, New York and Ohio,
The trust fund, which was pro-
posed in May, was filed with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York and is expected to receive
final approval next year. The deal
involves the government, Motors
" Liquidation Co., which represents
former GM assets that were not
placed in the new auto company,
14 states and the St. Regis Mohawk
Tribe in New York.
CHICAGO
Suspect pleads not
guilty to Chicago
bomb plot
A Lebanese immigrant pleaded
not guilty on yesterday to charges
alleging that he placed a backpack
he thought contained a bomb near
Chicago's Wrigley Field last month.
Sami Samir Hassoun, 22, smiled
at family members at the start of
the hearing. A relative crossed her
palms over her heart and blew Has-
soun a kiss.
Defense attorney Myron Auer-
bach entered the not guilty pleas
on his client's behalf. Hassoun is
charged with attempting to use a
weapon of mass destruction and
attempting to use an explosive
device. If convicted of the first
charge, he could be sentenced to
life in prison.
After the brief hearing, Auer-
bach told reporters that Hassoun
isn't a terrorist. In their compli-
ant, he noted, prosecutors also said
Hassoun had no apparent links to
extremists.
UNITED NATIONS
Diplomats: China

0 report on Sudan
China tried to block a U.N. report
alleging that Chinese ammunition
was sent to Darfur in violation of a
U.N. arms embargo but apparently
didn't succeed, U.N. diplomats said
yesterday.
The Security Council commit-
tee monitoring sanctions against
Sudan met Wednesday afternoon
and two diplomats familiar with
the closed-door deliberations said
China argued that the report by
the committee's panel of experts
should not be sent to the council.
One diplomat said China claimed
the panel was unprofessional and
flawed, and challenged its method-
ology.

The diplomats said the com-
mittee chairman, Austria's U.N.
Ambassador Thomas Mayr-Hart-
ing, agreed that the annex to the
report would be updated with a
letter to include additional infor-
mation on sources. But they said
the report itself would not be
changed, and will likely be formal-
ly sent to the 15-member council
next week.

A federal appeals court on

to stop enforcing its ban on open-
ly gay troops.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals instructed the law-
yers for the gay rights group that

serve but only if they keep secret
V their sexual orientation.
Government lawyers sought
to suspend U.S. District Judge
Virginia Phillips's ruling while

The Argo Dam in April. On Friday the City of Ann Arbor installed a stop log in the dam to drain the water in the headrace in
an effort to prepare the dam for repairs. The stop log will temporarily halt recreational boating activities in the dam.

Log installed Friday
will drain headrace,
temporarily halt
canoeing in dam
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
Students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents looking to go canoeing or
kayaking in the Argo dam will
have to find another place to take
their recreational boats, thanks
to a stop log installed in the
structure of the dam last week.
This log will allow the headra-
ce - a 1,500 foot-long channel
- of the dam to drain slowly in
preparation for upcoming repairs
and will also cease the dam's
waterflow for recreational pur-
poses like canoeing and kayak-
ing.
The repairs include recon-.
structing the headrace and
improvements of the border-to-
bordertrailthatlinestheembank-
ment path. While the repairs may
affect people trying to go to Gal-
lup Park, rowing teams will be
able to continue their practice
routines on the pond. In addi-
tion, the stop log is expected to
be of "minimal impact" to canoe-
ists since canoeing season ends
around mid-October, said Colin

Smith, manager for Ann Arbor's
Parks and Recreation Services.
The Argo dam has been a topic
of controversy since talks of
changing the mechanics of the
dam started last August when
City Administrator Roger Fra-
ser received a letter from the
Michigan Department of Natu-
ral Resources and the Environ-
ment saying that if the dam
wasn't repaired, it needed to be
removed.
The stop log was put in place
because of an agreement between
MDNRE and the city to address
the state's issues with the dam,
said Molly Wade, manager of the
city's water quality.
"Until we resolve the headrace
embankment deficiencies that are
defined in the consent agreement
with the state, we are basically
shutting down any river passage
for canoeists," Wade said. "That
is mandated by the state; we don't
have choice in this matter."
Wade added that if City Coun-
cil approves a proposal to address
the head race at its meeting
on Nov. 17, the dam would be
repaired by mid-summer of next
year.
On Tuesday night, the Park
Advisory Commission received
the headrace proposal favor-
ably with a 7-to-1 vote approving
plans to reconstruct the embank-
ment and headrace.

"City Council is the ultimate
decision maker," Smith said.
According to Smith, the con-
sent agreement was chosen
from two options, one of which
was a proposal to repair the toe
drain, which would cost between
$700,000 and $850,000. The
other option, which focuses on
repairing the headrace, would
cost about $1 million but would
ease most of the safety concerns
that the state has regarding the
Argo dam.
Smith said merely repairing
the toe drains would leave the
headrace embankment deficient
and probably wouldn't solve the
dam's issues.
Reconfiguring the headrace
- the second option at a cost
of about $988,000 - such that
the embankment actually con-
nects the headrace to the Huron
River, will remove pressure on
the embankment, Smith said.
The changes would alleviate the
issues presented by the toe drains
and create a paved path.
Smith said he is hopeful that
the city will approve the project,
but there is no way of telling if
the drafted costs and plans will
be received favorably.
"I'm sure the council will have
a number of questions, and ulti-
mately it is a community decision
for the direction that this ends up
going," Smith said.

Afghans and
coalition officials
question U.S.
efforts for peace
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- Over the past week, U.S. and
Afghan officials have been reveal-
ing tantalizing tidbits about talks
with Taliban leaders, raising
hopes for a peaceful resolution to
a war in its loth year.
"The international communi-
ty, our neighbors and our people
are marching toward it with full
strength," President Hamid Kar-
zai said in a speech Wednesday.
"The rumors we are hearing from
the Taliban and our other broth-
ers say a lot of people are hopeful
about this peace process."
But some coalition officials,
Afghans and people familiar with
insurgent leaders say contacts
with militants are nothing new
and have been overstated - per-
haps to split the ranks of fighters
or create the impression in the
West of progress in resolving the
unpopular war.
They also questioned how the
U.S. could be serious about peace
at a time when it is escalating
its military commitment with
punishing attacks in southern
Afghanistan and drone strikes
on militants across the border in
Pakistan.
"There have been contacts for
years," said Kai Eide, a Norwegian
diplomat and the U.N's former
envoy to Afghanistan. "My feel-
ing is that this is aslot of spin that
the war strategy is working - that
things are moving forward more
than they are."
Those with knowledge of the
discussions say Karzai's govern-
mentchas been in contact with top-
level insurgents, but caution that
the talks are fragile and are not
formal peace negotiations.
Mark Sedwill, NATO's top civil-
ian representative, said Wednes-
day that the Afghan government
had opened channels of communi-
cation with some insurgent lead-
ers.
"Some of these are significant
members of the Taliban leader-
ship," Sedwill said.
But he added: "It's not even yet
talks about talks."
The Taliban deny that any of
their representatives have been
involved in talks. They claim their
leaders will not discuss peace with
the government unless foreign
troops first leave Afghanistan.
The Associated Press was
unable to confirm independently
a report in The New York Times
that three members of the Tal-
iban's leadership council, known

as the Quetta Shura, have taken
part in preliminary discussions
with the Afghan government.
Experts familiar with the insur-
gent leadership expressed doubt
that such senior 'Taliban figures
would be involved in direct talks.
Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, a
former Afghan foreign minister
and confidant of Taliban leader
Mullah Omar, said the Taliban
leadership has not agreed to nego-
tiate.
"I'm hearing the comments of
the U.S. high-ranking officials, but
if the leaders of the Taliban are not
involved, then how can they make
peace?"
He said the Taliban are dubi-
ous that the U.S. is serious about
a peace process, because it has
raised its troop levels and is step-
ping up its military campaign in
southern Afghanistan.
"There is no trust line between
the U.S. and international com-
munity and the Taliban," he said.
"Because of this, the Taliban are
not serious about talking."
Muttawakil called on the U.S.
to release Taliban prisoners from
Guantanamo Bay and the U.N.
to remove the names of Taliban
figures from a sanctions list. He
said such goodwill gestures might
build trust that could provide
momentum for eventual negotia-
tions.
Hakimullah Mujahed, for-
mer Taliban ambassador to the
United Nations and a member of
an Afghan government council
tasked with exploring contacts,
called the reports of ongoing
discussions a "propaganda cam-
paign."
"If these people were sincere
in taking part in negotiations,
it would not be in the media, it
would be secret and underground
and through some friendly gov-
ernment," he said.
Muttawakil agreed that any
formal negotiations would be best
held outside Afghanistan, perhaps
in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates or Ger-
many.
U.S. officials have long said they
didn't expect the Taliban - the
hard-line Islamic movement that
harbored Osama bin Laden - to
talk peace as long as the militants
believed they were winning. That
stance changed publicly last week
when U.S. Defense Secretary Rob-
ert Gates and Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton backed
exploratory talks between the
Afghan government and the Tal-
iban.
The top NATO commander,
Gen. David Petraeus, even con-
firmed that coalition forces were
providing safe passage to senior
Taliban leaders who were talking
to the Afghan government.

Afghanistan throws away
quarter of election's ballots

Ballots in Sept.18
election said to be
frauds, reaction of
public unclear
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Afghanistan has thrown out near-
ly a quarter of ballots cast in last
month's parliamentary elections
because of fraud, but it is still far
from clear whether the public will
accept the results as fair.
The full preliminary results
from the Sept. 18 poll were
released yesterday after multiple
delays as election officials strug-
gled to weed out results from poll-
ing stations that never opened,
along with bunches of ballots all
cast for one candidate, or suspi-
ciously split SO-SO between two
people.
After last year's fraud-marred
presidential election, the gov-
ernment wanted to prove to the
Afghan people and international
allies that it is not mired in cor-
ruption but making strides for
reform.
While findings indicate that
cheating was pervasive, the rul-
ings also show election officials
were doing their job this time
around - by keeping fraudulent
ballots out of the totals.
"They've been doing a mod-
erately good job at detecting the
fraudulent ballots and removing
them. That's a positive thing," said
Andy Campbell, the Afghanistan
director for the National Demo-
cratic Institute, a U.S.-based elec-
tion-monitoring group.
It's a major change from last
year's presidential vote, when
election commissioners dumped
obviously fraudulent ballots into
the tally to help President Hamid
Karzai avoid a runoff with his
top challenger. It was only after
drawn-out investigations that

about a million ballots were
thrown out - the majority of them
for Karzai.
The 2009 presidential election
nearly derailed international sup-
port for Karzai, turning this year's
poll into a testof whether the gov-
ernment is committed to reforms
seen as key for justifying NATO
funding and troops.
Election commission chairman
Fazel Ahmad Manawi said about
1.3 million votes were disquali-
fied out of 5.6 million - or about
23 percent - because of ballot-box
stuffing or manipulated totals.
In many cases, commission
officials discovered as they inves-
tigated suspicious totals that they
came from voting sites that never
opened on election day - which
was marked by rocket attacks and
insurgent takeovers of polling sta-
tions in many provinces.
Other instances involved
polling stations that submitted
exactly 600 ballots - the precise
number allotted to each station
- or had the votes suspiciously
split even for one or two can-
didates, said Abdul Ahmadzai,
the commission's chief electoral
officer.
But the ballot annulment may
itself prompt cries of disenfran-
chisement. Voting was hardest to
monitor in insecure areas, mean-
ingmanyofthedisqualifiedballots
likely caine from the most conten-
tious parts of provinces. And in
many cases that also matches up
with ethnic divisions, suggesting
results could get weighted toward
one ethnic group.
In the province of Ghazni,
hardly anyone voted in the volatile
areas dominated by the Pashtun
ethnic group, while people turned
out in large numbers in areas pri-
marily occupied by the Hazara
ethnic group. Of the 11 seats in
Ghazni, eight went to Hazaras.
It was not immediately clear
what the results released Wednes-

day would mean for the makeup
of the 249-member parliament.
Manawi said he did not have fig-
ures on how many of the winners
were incumbents, though he said
he believed it was about a 50-50
split between those who were
returning and new representa-
tives. An Associated Press count
revealed about 73 incumbents,
suggesting that about two-thirds
of the representatives will be new.
Though Karzai has repeatedly
bypassed the parliament by issu-
ing laws by decree, the legisla-
tive body remains one of the few
checks on his power. A legislature
loaded with Karzai allies could
make it easier for the president to
avoid opposition.
A fraud investigation panel
still needs to rule on more than
2,000 complaints deemed serious
enough to affect results before
they can be finalized, which could
take weeks.
In some provinces, the investi-
gations could drastically change
the results. In eastern Nuristan,
for examples, Ahmadzai said it
was nearly impossible to untan-
gle the fraud and they eventually
released the results they had since
they knew the fraud panel was
planning to probe nearly all the
province's votingsites.
Some candidates may also
be disqualified outright if the
anti-fraud panel finds they were
behind attempts to manipulate
results. The election commission
has referred 224 candidates to the
panel for investigation because
they appeared to be involved in
cheating, Manawi said.
About 2,500 candidates ran
across 34 provinces.
The commission had originally
reported a lower turnout figure
of about 4.3 million. That earlier
figure was based on election day
estimates and revised up when
the actual tallies came in, said
Ahmadzai.

Employing the stimulus
State must find funds for unemployment benefits
As Michigan limps out of the recession, it may have to
face yet another obstacle: the expiration of federal aid to
state unemployment programs in the beginning of 2011.
Michigan's unemployment programs will be left scrambling to
find new funding. And as the state's jobless rate sits at 13 per-
cent, these job programs are essential for Michigan residents.
A large number of people depend on insurance checks to make
ends meet, so terminating benefits isn't an option. Though the
U.S. Congress must extend assistance as the state recovers, the
Michigan legislature must find stable internal funding for these
benefits to help the state's residents.

9

Currently, part of the federal stimulus
package allows states to borrow interest-
free from the federal government specifi-
cally to fund unemploymentprograms. This
measure is scheduled to expire in January,
which will make it difficult for the state to
pay for unemployment benefits. According
to an Oct. 19 article in The Michigan Mes-
senger, the state's federal interest bill will
reach $150 million in the 2011 fiscal year if
the relief isn't extended. To keep the budget
in order, the state maybe forced to cut some
unemployment benefits.
Maintaining funding for unemployment
benefits is especially important in Michi-
gan - the state's unemployment rate was
13.1 percent in August, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That makes
Michigan's unemployment rate second
only to Nevada's, which was 14.4 percent in
August. And Michigan's rate is greater than
the national average by about 4 percent.
The state has a responsibility to its citizens
to help them through periods of economic
strife. And cutting unemployment benefits
in the current economic climate would be
tantamount to abandoning the people who
lost their jobs asa result of the recession and
who depend on unemployment insurance.
To combat the potential loss of fund-

ing, money could be redirected to unem-
ployment programs from the state's other
expenditures. For example, some of the
state's planned $2 billion spending on the
Department of Corrections for the 2011 fis-
cal year could beused to help fill the gap left
by the withdrawal of federal aid.
But any redistribution of funds will
probably need to be accompanied by a tax
increase. Targeted increases of sin taxes
- taxes on "sin items" like cigarettes and
liquor - may be good options to minimize
negative impacts on the state's budget. Such
increases could help tide Michigan over
until the economy recuperates and other
tax revenues recover enough to fund the
essential roles of the state.
Though Michigan should be financially
independent and fiscally responsible, the
federal aid shouldn't be allowed to expire
yet - some states, like Michigan, aren't yet
ready to fend for themselves. The U.S. Con-
gress should vote to extend the lending deal
until states' economies are more stable.
Michigan's economy isn't ready to stand
on its own two feet yet. To protect those hit
hardest by the recession, the state and fed-
eral government should take incremental
steps in the short term to ensure that those
in need of aid aren't left stranded.

After seven years without a
mascot, Mississippi Univer-
ity announced on Oct. 14 a
replacement of its previous mascot,
Colonel Reb. The
Colonel - an old
Southern man who
looks like a ste-
reotype of a nine-
teenth century
plantation owner
- was banished
in 2003, and will
now be replaced
by the Rebel Black JEREMY
Bear. Colonel LEVY
Reb's departure
has not been met
with unanimous
approval. A group of students found-
ed The Colonel Reb Foundation in
its memory and plan on dressing like
the old mascot at upcoming football
games.
The Colonel Reb Foundation's
founder snarked to The New York
Times in an Oct. 14 article that the
school should call itself "Politically
Correct University."
Unfortunately, the term 'politi-
cally correct' doesn't have much of
a reputation. As this case shows, it's
frequently used to discredit liber-
als as oversensitive or as looking for
excuses to take offense. Many on the
left try to avoid being characterized
this way. For instance, LSA adver-
tises its Intergroup Relations pro-
gram - which facilitates dialogue
between typically opposing groups -
as "beyond politically correct."
There are certainly cases when
PCness can "run amok," to steal a
phrase from fellow Daily columnist
Imran Syed (Political correctness run
amok, 02/21/2010). But in the case of
sports mascots that invoke troubled
pasts, the left can't be bullied by the
term. It's a case where being politi-
cally correct makes the most sense.
Certain attempts to be PC can be
trivial or unproductive. For instance,
trying to correct friends and acquain-
tances every time they misuse theword

gay' is probably a losingbattle. Perhaps
my favorite example of PC gone wrong
was when I was in South Africa two
summers ago and a teacher, who was
giving my group a tour of his school,
continuously referred to his students
as "African American." But none of his
students were actually American -
theywere simplyAfrican.
But the fight against offensive
sports mascots can be productive.
Sports are tremendously important
to American culture. For that rea-
son, the symbols used as mascots are
pervasive and meaningful to a lot of
people. At the same time, some of
these mascots carry the memory of
the history that comes with them. By
changing mascots, a university or a
franchise can signal how American
values have changed over time and
how certain practices that were once
acceptable no longer are.
Colonel Reb's historical signifi-
cance is fairly conspicuous. His use
as a mascot romanticizes the Ante-
bellum South, which can't be viewed
separately from the slave system that
supported it. Furthermore, the cari-
cature was developed in the 1940s
and was part of university culture
during periods characterized by
racial struggles.
In recent years, the Ole Miss lead-
ership has made many changes to
amend its image as a racially intol-
erant university. It has admitted a
larger percentage of black students,
scolded the use of Confederate flags
at football games and abandoned
"Dixie" as its fight song, according
to a Sept. 19 article in The New York
Times. The decision to abandon Colo-
nel Reb was part of the same trend.
Ole Miss isn't the only university
with mascot controversies. Many
universities and professional sports
franchises are under scrutiny for
using Native American mascots.
Though controversies with Native
Americans are currently less salient
than racial issues, the use of Native
Americans as mascots is no more
acceptable.

There are few other cases where it
has become common practice to use
living and prominent ethnic groups
as a mascot. Most mascots and team
names tend to fall under the follow-
ing categories: inanimate objects,
animals, historical groups that no
longer exist (Trojans, Spartans,
Celtics), and nicknames with local
significance (Corn Huskers, Steel-
ers, Saints). The one exception here
is the Fighting Irish, but that name
makes sense since, historically, many
Notre Dame players and followers
were actually Irish. Lumping Native
Americans into the pool of carica-
tures that make up sports mascots is
humiliating.
Getting rid of
offensive mascots
is simply practical. 0
Some may argue that Native Ameri-
can mascots are a sign of respect, as
they are supposed to be symbols of
bravery. But given this country's histo-
ry of Native American oppression and
the current tendency to ignore Native
American grievances, many don't see it
this way. To many Native Americans,
the mascots are simply insulting.
Breaking with tradition is never
easy. If the University of Michigan
had happened to adopt a Colonel Reb
or a Chief Illiniwek of the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in
its early history, we would probably
be going through the same types of
controversies. But contrary to the
criticism, this is not a case of exces-
sive political correctness. Getting rid
of offensive sports mascots is practi-
cal and feasible, and it will have long-
term effects on our social values. It's
a case of PC gone right.

YONAH LIEBERMANI
Heed JFK's call 50 years later

A week ago today marks the 50th anniversary
of John F. Kennedy's historic call from the steps
of the Michigan Union for students to engage in
international service. Then-Senator Kennedy
(who was running for president) spoke in the wee
hours of Oct. 14, 1960 - 2 a.m. to be exact - in a
light rain before more than 5,000 students.
Appropriately, our university has been cel-
ebrating this speech for the past few weeks.
It culminated in a great speaker series on the
steps of the Union at 2 a.m. on Oct. 14. Individu-
als spoke about University students' role in the
creation of the Peace Corps and discussed how
far the organization has come since that fateful
day 50 years ago.
I was inspired. But after inspiration comes
meditation. I got to thinking, what exactly were
Kennedy's words? So I looked it up.
Kennedy said, "How many of you who are
going to be doctors are willing to spend your
days in Ghana? Technicians or engineers, how
many of you are willing to work in the Foreign
Service and spend your lives traveling around
the world?"
That was a call for a Peace Corps? That was
this "historic" moment in American history?
Those two sentences sent 200,000 Americans
abroad - including more than 2,300 University
alum - to work peacefully in developingnations?
And the simple answer is no.
My favorite speaker of the night was Dr. Alan
Guskin. As graduate students at Michigan in
1960, Al and his wife Judy took that simple call
for international service and gathered petitions,
organized conventions and encouraged Ken-
nedy to form the Peace Corps.
As we all know, it worked. The lesson I
learned is that students have an incredible
capacity to create. We are young and idealistic.
The world needs our energy and our idealism
to address the grim realities of our society.
The 1960s were notorious for students' role
in the civil rights and anti-war movements. But
today, more and more adults view students as
apathetic. We need to work together to change
that perception.
On this campus, there are hundreds of active
student organizations in all different shapes
and sizes doing great things. Thousands of
students take full advantage of these oppor-
tunities to participate in cultural, educational
or activist organizations. These people ensure
that year after year and generation after gener-
ation, a huge variety of campus organizations
remains vibrant and active.

But countless students choose not to immerse
themselves in the subculture of student organi-
zations. Many do not participate at all. Others
join simply to pad their resumes, never putting in
the necessary energy to create something great.
And these students don't know what they're
missing. I have found that the volunteer and
activist work I have done has been incredibly
enriching and rewarding.
I recognize that everyone on campus needs
to balance friends and family with reading and
tests. I recognize that many students need to
devote time and energy to holding down work-
study jobs simply to attend the University.
I even recognize that the countless student
groups on campus can be overwhelming.
But most people are only in college once.
After college we must focus on jobs and fami-
lies. This time, right now, is our one chance to
join the ranks of the Guskins and many other
student activists who helped shape the world
we live in today.
We need a shift in student mentality. Instead
of writing off activism due to time constraints,
we must make time to devote to others instead
of ourselves. President Barack Obama has
called on our country - and specifically the
younger generation - to serve a greater pur-
pose than oneself. We should all heed this call.
The world has changed since the student
activism of the '60s. Today's students have less
time and more to think about. Finding the right
balance between necessary academic pursuits
and volunteer student activism is a challenge.
So we need to adjust our definition of student
activists. Low-time commitment opportuni-
ties must become more popular. With more
than 26,000 undergrads and 15,000 graduate
students, the pool of students at the University
waiting to be activists is huge.
Students: Start small. Take time to find one
student organization devoted to helping the
community (local, national or global) through
volunteer work or activism and find out how to
become involved. Ask friends what they do if
you need ideas. Don't be overwhelmed - if an
hour is all you have time for, start with that.
Leaders: Be imaginative. Let's make sure we
have programs that provide opportunities for
all shapes and sizes of student involvement.
The movement for the Peace Corps started
with students on this campus. Only you know
what could be next. Let's create it together.
Yonah Lieberman is an LSA sophomore.

Fast track to economi~c recovery

n the early 1930s, our country
was in the midst of the Great
Depression, with thousands out
of work. In order to
bbost the economy
and help the work-
ing class, the U.S.
began multiple
government-fund-
ed work projects as
part of President
Franklin D. Roos-
evelt's New Deal,
like the Hoover JOE
Dam. The dam SUGIYAMA
helped to power
much of the South-
west and brought
thousands of jobs to suffering Ameri-
cans. Following the example set by
Roosevelt, the state of California is
currently working to implement a
high-speed railway system. It would
help to create jobs, re-energize the
economy and address our current
environmental anxieties.
Early in August, construction on
a $4.2-billion Transbay Transit Cen-
ter broke ground, becoming the first
step in a potential $53.1-billion project
connecting San Francisco, Los Ange-
les, Fresno and San Diego by way of
a high-speed rail. The transit center
alone will create 48,000 jobs in the
San Francisco area and will serve
more than 45 million passengers a
year. This will be the country's first
high-speed railway system. It seems
that we could soon join the fraternity
of countries that have already figured
out that effective public transporta-
tion is the way of the future.
Let me be clear that construction
of a high-speed railway in California
hasn't gotten the green light yet. The
Transbay Transit Center will operate
as a base for the bus and rail systems
already in place in San Francisco, but
it's also being designed to facilitate
high-speed railways. Late in Septem-
ber, the state of California was granted
$194 million to conduct preliminary
engineering and environmental analy-

sis for the project. This is an encour-
aging act of faith, demonstrating
confidence in the plausibility of the
high-speed railway.
The state of Michigan is working
on a similar project that would link
cities such as Grand Rapids, Detroit
and perhaps even Chicago with a
high-speed railway. Michigan isn't
as far along as California in terms
of development, but it's encouraging
to know that our state sees the same
potential in the technology.
Why it has taken the United States
so long to begin a project like this is
beyond me. After we pioneered our
way across the country with our first
transcontinental railway system, it
seemed that once the technology was
available, high-speed railways would
be the next logical step. Yet the word
"complacent" comes to mind - we
spent the entire 20th century relying
on cars and trucks and pumped bil-
lions of pounds of greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere.
If the California high-speed railway
is approved and constructionbegins, it
should be finished between 2020 and
2030. The cost-benefit analysis shows
that the railway should net about
$2.84 billion by 2050. In addition to
the fiscal advantages, the impact the
rail system would have on the environ-
ment is invaluable.
The California High-Speed Rail
Authority projects that a passenger
choosing the rail instead of an air-
plane or a car would use one-third and
one-tenth less energy, respectively.
This dip in energy usage amounts to
5.8 million barrels of oil per year by
2030. It would also expel about one-
tenth less pollutants and 6.8 billion
less pounds of carbon dioxide annual-
ly into the atmosphere. The CaHSRA
plans to achieve these projections with
a mixture of natural gas and renew-
able energy methods to power the
railways. They also have a 100-percent
renewable energy goal that would save
12.7 million barrels of oil annually and
prevent 12 billion pounds of carbon

dioxide from being released into the
atmosphere annually.
The railway also has a convenience
factor that shouldn't be ignored. It
would take a 6.5-hour car trip from
San Francisco to Los Angeles and turn
it into a 2.6-hour ride. Not only is train
travel faster than car travel, but with
so many people choosing to ride the
train, highway congestion would also
be reduced.
High-speed
railways need more
momentum.
This project would generate nearly
$2.6 billion in profits and thousands
of new jobs, not to mention shrink our
carbon footprint, implement renew-
able energy systems and reduce trav-
el time. Why haven't we done this
already? Apparently, because we live in
a country so reluctant to react to some-
thing so beneficial that opportunities
often pass us right by. For instance, a
1,000-megawatt Lake Michigan wind
farm was shot down by people more
concerned with their view of the lake
than future generations. The high-
speed railway could fall victim to simi-
lar scrutiny, but the multidimensional
nature of this green technology makes
it less susceptible to the same criticism
and more likelyto materialize.
If California gets it right and sets
the standard for public transpor-
tation, job creation and renewable
energy, it will be setting an example
for the rest of the country. A success-
ful implementation of this technolo-
gy in California could be the catalyst
Michigan needs to accelerate plans
for our own high-speed railway.

streetlights as being a pedestrian

are certainly not sufficient for
residential property and personal
safety."
City Council is now looking for
alternative cost-cutting measures
that will not compromise its citi-
zens' feelings of safety and com-
fort, Taylor said. He added that the
city is in the process of installing
LED lights in the nearly 22 percent
of streetlights that belong to the
city.
The remaining streetlights in
Ann Arbor are owned and operat-
ed by DTE Energy, which has not
yet reached an agreement with the
city regarding LED technology.
"It's not an ordinary customer
relationship," Taylor said. "These
are lights not owned by the city,
so we are sort of negotiating some-
thing we don't have direct leverage
with."
The University is also making
efforts to cut costs and energy
consumption that result from
streetlights. According to a state-

"The program is about learning
how to make your own reality,"
Baetzel said.
Students from all majors and
backgrounds can apply to be a part
of Michigan in Washington. The
University of California houses
the students admitted to the pro-
gram in a residence hall five blocks
away from the White House. Pro-
gram participants write a 25-page
research paper and take required
classes and electives while in the
capital.
Baetzel said that though most
associate the program with the
political science department, it's
open to students from all majors.
"We'd like to see more stu-
dents outside of political science
do this," Baetzel said. "There's a
perception that you have to be a
'straight A' student, but we're look-

ing for blended students."
LSA seniors Kelly Behr and
Marianna Golovan met in D.C.
during the fall 2009 semester of
the program. They said they're
excited to be a part of the fifth
anniversary celebration because
it will help them build on the rela-
tionships they made through the
program.
"The five-year reunion is going
to be a great opportunity for net-
working because they are going
to have a job panel of those people
who have given us internships
before," Behr said.
Golovan said she plans to net-
work at the event as well. She said
she values the relationships she
has established through the pro-
gram, adding that she and Behr are
now best friends.
"It's a wonderful opportunity
to learn to be a professional while
still in college," Golovan said.
Behr said that the Michigan in
Washington program was part of
what attracted her to the Univer-
sity.
Public Policy senior Jared
Gamelin said he decided to go to
D.C. for the winter 2010 semester
because it gave him the opportuni-
ty to study somewhere else besides

that much of the plan deals with
the other side of the stadium. She
added that - like the stadium's
recent no water bottle or handbag
policies - the plan is one of many
to greatly reduce the risk of harm
to patrons.
"It's another evolution in
increasing the safety and security
for patrons," Brown said. "From a
public perspective, this is the next
big plan."
A similar plan could be used
for large events at Crisler Arena,
Brown added.
ment from Jim Kosteva, direc-
tor of community relations, the
University is "actively reviewing
alternative technology approaches
to providing lighting on campus."
Kosteva said the University's
overall goal includes reducing its
energy footprint and cost, but he
stressed that "safety is of para-
mount concern."
"Our personnel are continually
monitoring the progress of tech-
nology in providing energy effi-
cient lighting; however, as of yet,
they have not found a new light-
ing methodology that delivers the
desired amount of lighting inten-
sity that would meet our safety
criteria," Kosteva said. "They will
continue to follow advancements
in the electrical lighting indus-
try."
Taylor said for the time being,
City Council members and resi-
dents are pleased with the repeal
of the original lighting reduction
plan.
"It was a good effort to do the
city's work for less," Taylor said.
"We sought to pull back our lights
to (the vehicular) standard, and we
determined during the course of
this pilot program that that stan-
dard was inapplicable to the resi-
dential experience."
prosecutors and the man may face
criminal charges of illegal entry
and possession of a weapon in the
stadium, Brown said.
Though Brown said the incident
was a "collective issue" for police
officers and athletic staff, she said
University Police are taking mea-
sures to make sure it does not hap-
pen again.
"We're continuing to review all
of our protocol but again I stress
that the public wasn't put at any
kind of risk," Brown said.
campus and was more affordable
than studying abroad.
"I was looking for a real-world
experience in the field that I want
to go in to," Gamelin said. "You
can't really beat living in D.C."
Gamelin added that the pro-
gram provides a great opportunity
for students toget what D.C. has to
offer while still attending the Uni-
versity.
"Your overall college experi-
ence is going to be a lot different
when you get to step away from the
Ann Arbor bubble," he said.
Recent University graduate
Salim Alchurbaji was Gamelin's
roommate during the winter 2010
semester. He said he decided to
apply for the program because he
thought it would "be a great step-
ping stone."
"It was a great opportunity to
kind of get my feet wet in D.C.,"
Alchurbaji said. "There's always
opportunities to network and

meet people."
Alchurbaji said one of his favor-
ite experiences of the program was
getting the chance to meet one of
his role models - Dr. Paul Farmer,
founder of Partners in Health an
organization that aims to bring
social justice in health world-
wide - while interning with the
U.S. Global Leadership Coalition.
But Farmer was only one of the
many public health professionals
Alchurbaji said he met as a result
of the program.
"I'm plugged into a great net-
work of public health, policy, advo-
cacy, humanitarian relief work
and non-profit organizations,"
Alchurbaji said.
LSA senior Seth Buchsbaum
interned for the office of Energy
and Climate Change in the White
House while participating in the
program during the winter 2010
semester. He said he's confident
that he will get a job after he
graduates because of the connec-
tions he made during his time in
D.C.
"The vast majority of my work
was actually substantive," Buchs-
baum said.

Stimulus spending a key issue in midterms

GOP in states
nationwide attacking
Dems for 'failed
stimulus' project
DENVER (AP) - A photo of
President Barack Obama hangs
on the wall in CoraFaye's Cafe, a
short walk from the Denver muse-
um where Obama signed into law
the most sweeping U.S. economic
package in decades in an attempt
to put people back to work and
end the worst downturn since the
Great Depression.
But the folks tucking into fried
chicken and cornbread at Cora-
Faye's roll their eyes when asked
whether the 2009 stimulus made
a difference.
"Are you kidding?" said Donn
Headley Sr., a 61-year-old whose
heating and air conditioning com-
pany closed last year because of
slow business.
Republicans nationwide are
attacking Democrats with a
"failed stimulus" campaign drum-
beat. In ads, debates and campaign
TOWN HALL
From Page lA
- after the Gay Liberation Front
in Ann Arbor asked the University
to develop an organization that
would cater to the needs of homo-
sexual students.
Toy said he hopes to foster an
environment of increased toler-
ance at the University by quelling
hateful speech and cheers at hock-
ey games, which he hopes Uni-
versity Athletic Director David
Brandon makes a priority.
"The climate at hockey games
is totally sexist and totally homo-
phobic, and that situation has got
to get addressed," Toy said.
Extending the conversation
beyond sexual orientation, the
panel emphasized decreasing seg-
regation in the classroom and on
campus, particularly within the
College of Engineering.
Holloway said many students
view the liberal arts and humani-
ties classes as pivotal places for
learning the basics of respectful
discussion and diverse interac-
tion, but many don't think they
can learn the same values in the
more science and math-based and
less interactive discipline of engi-
neering - a notion he believes is
false.
"Sometimes as engineers, we
tend to step back and say we do
analytical stuff that's all very
clear cut and scientific, and so we
don't have that same kind of issue,
we don't interact in the same way,"
Holloway said. "Of course that's
garbage, because we interact with
each other in exactly those ways.
"Our ability to interact with
each other in a respectful way, to
hear each others' needs, to take
into account how various stake-
holders have competing needs
and how to balance those are
very important as engineers," he
added.
Scott, a University alum, said
while integration has greatly
increased since he graduated in
1975, he still sees students of the
same ethnicity clinging together
and not venturing outside racial
boundaries.

mailers, they deride the $814 bil-
lion program as having reinforced
out-of-control spending and doing
little to help.
In reality, the stimulus program
has done more than Republicans
often claim - and less than Demo-
crats may want to admit in the face
of a sluggish economy and high
unemployment. Moreover, the
spending continues into next year,
meaning the impact of the pro-
gram cannot be fully measured.
The nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office reported last month
that 1.4 million to 3.3 million peo-
ple are employed because of the
program, a blow to Republican
claims that the stimulus failed to
increase employment.
The stimulus program has kept
many state and local governments
fiscally viable, and the money has
been a boon to the construction
industry, financing thousands of
road and bridge projects. In other
areas - tax cuts, Medicaid health
benefits, unemployment checks,
food stamps - the stimulus has
provided some relief to millions
suffering in a tough economy.
Still, there is broad skepticism

that the stimulus package helped
the nation's economy, according to
a new AP-GfK poll. A plurality of
likely voters say the bill had no real
effect on it. About three in 10 say it
did more to damage the economy
while about the same share think
it helped to bring about improve-
ments.
Most Democrats say it did more
to help, the AP-GfK poll found,
while a narrow majority of Repub-
lican voters think it did even more
damage than would have hap-
pened otherwise. And those with
doubts about the bill's effective-
ness are far more apt to say they
trust Republicans over Democrats
to do a better job handling the
economy.
Negative perceptions have
turned the stimulus into a politi-
cal stick for Republicans to wield
against Democrats:
-In Colorado, rookie Demo-
cratic Sen. Michael Bennet and
three House Democrats are strug-
gling to fend off challengers who
routinely point out their votes for
the stimulus. Out-of-state interest
groups allied with the GOP air ads
calling it a failure and a spending

spree.
-Rep. Jim Marshall, a con-
servative Georgia Democrat who
has resisted vigorous challenges
from Republicans before, may be
undone this year by a challenger
whose ads conclude: "Times are
hard. Jim Marshall made them
worse."
-In southeast Michigan, Dem-
ocratic Rep. Gary Peters ousted a
Republican incumbent two years
ago. This election, Republican
challenger Rocky Raczkowski
campaigns on the stimulus daily
with a blunt, if unscientific,
assessment: "It ended up being
super-duper government waste."
-In Texas, 20-year incumbent
Rep. Chet Edwards told The Dal-
las Morning News this month his
vote for the stimulus might cost
him re-election.
-In Maryland, first-term Dem-
ocratic Rep. Frank Kratovil voted
against his party on health care
and supports a balanced bud-
get amendment. No matter. His
Republican opponent, Andy Har-
ris, depicts Kratovil as a profligate
spender for supporting a final ver-
sion of the stimulus law.

SALAM RIDA/Da
Panelists and attendees of a town hall that focused on campus diversity hosted by UMEC chat at the event last night.

"The fact that minority stu-
dents are here does not mean
that they are necessarily included
and engaged," Scott said. "You
can walk around campus and see
diversity, and see that diversity
moves in clumps. Our center is all
about trying to change the para-
digm."
Holloway said the College of
Engineering is also working to
increase diversity in gender in
the engineering field. He added
that the college has been trying to
implement various techniques to
enroll more women in engineer-
ing programs, especially comput-
er engineering which has been a
predominantly male-driven con-
centration.
"One strategy that we are try-
ing to peruse is to recruit faculty
that are more representative of
the student body, and we've actu-
ally had some pretty good suc-
cess with women faculty in some
departments," Holloway said.
Scott said while female enroll-
ment in computer science engi-
neering is low, information
technology companies are con-
tinually looking to recruit female
employees, adding that women

engineers should not be discour-
aged by the prevalence of men in
industry.
"Women do as well or better
than men in industry from an IT
standpoint," Scott said. "Corpo-
rations are doing everything they
can to encourage women to go into
computer science and computer
engineering because there's a des-
perate need for that talent going
forward."
In addition to embracing racial
and gender equality, Segal said he
believes students need to be more
aware of the prevalence of dis-
abilities and unreported mental
disorders on campus. Segal said he
hopes that students with mental
disorders will someday feel more
comfortable about being open
about them in order to get rid of
negative stereotypes.
"Most of the disabilities that
are on campus are invisible," Segal
said. "A person with a disability
has their own sort of needs, wants,
desires, comforts, and securities
around the issue. There's a lot of
stigma within these groups to be
public and identify themselves."
Segal said that because students
he works with want to keep their

mental disorders secret among
friends, when he encounters them
on campus they often ignore him.
"There's still a lot of work to
do to get people even comfort-
able with their own disability, to
see it not in such a stigmatized
way, because we all carry a bunch
of stereotypes, particularly with
mental health issues," Segal said.
Engineering senior Bethany
Glesner, honors and services
director of UMEC, said the group
decided to throw the event after
receiving grievances that meet-
ings were failing to focus on
improving the state of campus life.
"We had gotten complaints in
the past that our general body
meetings were boring and not
useful, so we were trying to come
up with a way to get not only the
student organizations involved
but also the student population at
large to come and actually partici-
pate," Glesner said.
"People are willing to talk
about campus climate and people
are willing to help if you have
problems," she added. "There are
resources and campus climate can
be a problem, but it can also be
improved."

Chechen warlord may be behind parliament attack

Officials say Gakayev
wants to become
Islamist insurgency
leader
GROZNY, Russia (AP) - A sui-
cide attack on Chechnya's parlia-
ment may have been staged by a
shadowy warlord who wants to
establish himself as a leader of
the Russian region's factionalized
Islamist insurgency, officials and
analysts said yesterday.
Some observers said they
believe there could be an escala-
tion of violence as 40-year-old
Khusein Gakayev moves to assert
his supremacy over the divided
rebels.
In the attack, "the goal here isto
demonstrate Gakayev's authority,"
said Yulia Latynina, a Moscow-
based columnist and Caucasus
expert.
No one immediately claimed
responsibility for Tuesday's attack
by three suicide attackers, who got
inside the tightly guarded parlia-
ment complex in the capital, Gro-
zny, as legislators gathered for
a session. The attackers opened
fire and blew themselves up, kill-
ing two police officers and a par-
liamentary aide and wounded 17
other people.
Chechnya's Interior Ministry
branch told the ITAR-Tass news
agency that it believed the attack

was planned by Gakayev to boost
his credentials among other rebels
and their supporters abroad. It did
not offer evidence.
Islamic insurgents have taken
root across Russia's predominant-
ly Muslim North Caucasus region
and are trying to turn it into an
independent emirate that adheres
to Shariah, or Islamic law. Since
2007, the movement has been led
by the guerrilla leader Doku Uma-
rov, who spread confusion through
the rebel ranks in August by first
announcing and then annul-
ling his resignation in two videos
released three days apart.
Analysts say that apparent inde-
cision exacerbated a schism in the
rebel leadership between those
striving for a new Shariah state in
the Caucasus and those focusing
on Chechnya's independence.
Gakayev, who has never been
known to promote pan-Caucasian
Islamism, was a little-known lieu-
tenant to more senior rebels who
has recently emerged as a leading
figure in the insurgency.
In a video posted on the Chech-
en rebel website Daymohk.org
on Oct 7, Gakayev and two other
Chechen rebel field commanders
renounced their oath of allegiance
to Umarov. In the video they also
call Gakayev the Emir of Chech-
nya, and therefore their leader.
Gakayev also has won support
of a prominent Chechen in exile,
Akhmed Zakayev.
Some Caucasus watchers said

0

Special Force (OMON) officers are seen in front of Chechen parliament complex after a bomb blast in Grozny, Chechnya, southern Russia Tuesday. Insurgents stormed the
parliament complex in Russia's volatile Chechnya region on Tuesday, killing at least 2 police officers and one parliamentary official, authorities said.

Gakayev could be using this
momentum to launch a fresh
wave of attacks against the Mos-
cow-backed Chechen president,
Ramzan Kadyrov and try to dem-
onstrate his ability to control the
whole movement.
Gakayev's group stands accused
by the authorities of mastermind-
ing an unprecedented attack on
Kadyrov's home village that left 19
people dead, including five civil-
ians.

"There is a new generation of
fighters, a group of young wolves,"
says Pavel Baev, an expert on
Chechnya and its neighbors at
the International Peace Research
Institute in Oslo.
Tuesday's raid on the parlia-
ment seems to bear the same
unusual trademarks as that village
raid: groups of well-trained gun-
men, equipped with suicide vests,
striking directly at Kadyrov's
strongholds.

"They have managed to get
fighters ready to act as canon fod-
der, and to form a structure of cells
that can not only attract these
fighters but prepare them for these
complex attacks," says Alexander
Cherkasov, a Chechnya expert and
board member of Russia's lead-
ing human rights group, Memo-
rial. "This tells us of a new level of
organization."
The rebels' renewed vigor in
striking Kadyrov's strongholds

will likely spell trouble for his
regime, said Caucasus expert
Latynina.
In the past, Kadyrov managed
to recruit many ex-militants into
his feared security forces and
sought to blunt the rebels' appeal
with a massive construction boom
and a campaign to impose strict
Islamic values. He has repeatedly
boasted that a few dozen remain-
ing rebels were starving and ready
to surrender.

On Tuesday during the weekly

Rodriguez
announced that

nificant. Maybe
Campbell will
indeed help the Wolverines more
on offense than he can on defense.
He is, after all, a behemoth of a man
who was probably too big with too
little technique to succeed on the
defensive line.
Plus, Michigan has a pretty good
defensive line, even if everything
behind it is below average.
But Campbell's move is the straw
that broke my camel's back. A move
to offensive line? If you watched
the replay of the blocked field goal
on Saturday, a great deal of the
blame was on Campbell's shoulders
for faulty blocking, having stood

straight up and allowingIowa to
get more penetration.
So I came to the conclusion:
Either there is something wrong
with the recruiting experts or the
Wolverines are doing a pretty poor
job at developingtalent.
From 2002-08, aside from play-
ers like Brandon Graham, LaMarr
Woodley and Chad Henne who are
staples in the NFL, Michigan has
had a few other recruits flame out
similar to how Campbell has so far.
Obviously, there's a few transfers
who don't really count in this cat-
egory. Justin Boren and Ryan Mal-
lett especially, since they're doing
so well at their respective transfer
destinations.
But a lot of other transfers
might have left because things
weren't quite working out in Ann
Arbor. Guys like Taylor Hill, Dann
O'Neill, Marcus Witherspoon and
Cobrani Mixon are all names most
Michigan fans probably don't even
remember anymore. They were all
pretty highly touted four stars, too.
Then, there are guys like Camp-
bell and Justin Turner and Kevin
Grady, who were big-time five-stars

and never reached their supposed
potential. Prescott Burgess, mean-
while, one of the Wolverines other
big-time five-stars, had a pretty
good career in Ann Arbor. But by
no means was it great.
So what's going on? Guys like
Mike Williams and Boubacar Cis-
soko were supposed to be staples
in the secondary, a group that defi-
nitely needs them right now. But
Cissoko is in prison after being a
below average cornerback to start,
and Williams lost his spot several
times over to players in the second-
ary now.
Any of these recruits blossoming
on defense might have been a wel-
come help to what the Wolverines
have seen on the field so far.
What about Jason Kates? Or
James McKinney? Or Justin Schi-
fano? Or Zion Babb?
All four stars, all either slid into
obscurity or are no longer in Ann
Arbor. Yes, a great deal of that had
to do with the Carr-Rodriguez
coaching change. A new era at such
a tradition-laden college football
program is bound to bring some
defections.

Butthe Wolverines haven't been
putting nearly as much talent into
the NFL as they used to. Michigan
used to be the prince of develop-
ment, but now it seems to be the
pauper.
ESPN's Colin Cowherd called
attention to this on his radio show
a while ago. And thoughI was
initially hostile toward the accusa-
tions, maybe there's some founded
takeaway points from the Wolver-
ines' bizarre lack of success stories.
The weirdest part of Michigan's
development, however, has been
its number of positive accomplish-
ments with lower-starred players.
Guys like David Harris or Mike
Hart, two of the best in the last
decade were three-stars. Patrick
Omameh, who should start on the
offensive line and be a rock in the
position group for the next few
years, was a two-star.
Maybe recruiting just doesn't
make sense. But news of Campbell
moving seems to be a white flag
from the coachingstaff, and it's
time for the Wolverines to at least
start noticingthat something is not
quite right.

Daily Sports
Power Rankings
By Nick Saar II Daily Snorts Editor

Senior setter Lexi Zimmerman has established herself as one of the best volleyball players in program history.
Lexi Zimmerman,Setter (Volleyball)
E Icouldn't make it to the volleyball game against Michigan State last Wednesday and I couldn't tune
into Big Ten Network to watch. ButI had to find out what kind of encore Zimmerman would produce
after posting a triple-double in her previous match. Online game-casting was the only option. With the
Michigan all-time assists record already under her belt, what else could she possibly have in store? How
about a second consecutive triple-double. This time with 38 assists, 11 kills and 10 digs in a close four-
set win over the Spartans. I can't decide which was more unbelievable: her gaudy numbers or my over-
the-top excitement for a volleyball game-cast. She also almost registered a third straight triple-double
two days later, tallying 41 assists, 8kills and 7 digs in a win over No. 20 Northwestern.
2 Rachael Mack, Forward (Field Hockey}
2 Mack carried the Wolverines to a 4-3 overtime victory over Northwestern on Friday, scoring the
overtime winner and notching her first career hat trick in the process. The freshman leads the team
with 12 goals in just 15 games. And Mack is just one of many freshmen to appear in the rankings
and fill some big shoes on a Michigan roster. She's one of four to make the rankings this week alone.
Maybe these impressive freshmen are a good omen for the men's basketball team, a roster that boasts
almost as many freshmen as the North Campus dorms.
3 Denard Robinson, Quarterback (Football)
E Entering Saturday's game against No. 15 Iowa, Denard's chances at leapfrogging Zimmerman for the
top spot already looked slim. Like the volleyball star, he has certainly put up some downright crazy
numbers before, but it would be a tall order against the nation's fourth-ranked defense. He performed
admirably enough before being injured to barely keep himself in Heisman contention. But he needs a
bounce-back game ina couple of weeks at Penn State or else his chances are pretty much toast. With the
way Tate Forcier was able to lead Michigan down the field, Michigan fans should probably be more wor-
ried about the other Robinson, defensive coordinator Greg Robinson. After all, going one game without
surrendering more than 30 points would sure be a nice luxury for the Wolverines.
4 Alex Hunt, Outside Hiter (Volleyball)
F Once again, Hunt's stellar play goes relatively unnoticed because of Zimmerman - not that Hunt
minds Zimmerman routinely racking up triple-doubles. But in that same match against the Spartans on
Wednesday, Hunt recorded her 1,000th career kill. She's helped lead No. 13 Michigan to seven wins in
eight Big Ten contests. By the way, she nearly had a triple-double of her own in that same match - with
21 kills, 9 digs and 6 assists.
5 Joeyarber ('en's Golf)
For a week at least, someone not named Lion Kim stole the show for the Michigan men's golf team.
Garber finished tied for second at the Bank of Tennessee Intercollegiate, shootinga five-under 67 in the
second round to vault him up the leaderboard. It was only the freshman's fourth career start, so that's
some remarkable progress in less than two months time.

A
ARICL BOND/Daily
Seniorgoaltender Shawn Hunwick tallied a career-high 45 saves against New Hampshire on Saturday.
6.Michigan Goaltenders (ice Hockey)
Bryan Hogan had a 33-save shutout in an exhibition performance against the Under-18 US Nation-
al Team Development Program. Shawn Hunwick answered with a career-high 45 saves in a 3-3 tie
against No. 8 New Hampshire. Red Berenson faces a dilemma many coaches would love: which hot
goalie should get the next start? At this point, he may as well alternate the two or simply draw straws.
But who does Berenson seem to preferSWell, who did he choose to start in an exhibition game against
a bunch of teenagers and who did he choose to start on the road against one of the nation's top teams?
7 SoonySaad, Forward (Men's Soccer)
On Tuesday night, the Wolverines suffered an ugly 7-1 loss to top-ranked Akron. It was their second
straight defeat, but that doesn't stop Soony from regaining a spotin the rankings. He is currently riding a
four-game goal scoring streak and leads the team with 12 goals on the season. He will have to wait until
Wednesday to extend the streak to five games, as Michigan has eight days between games after playing
three times in one week.
8 Jennifer Cross, Middle Blocker (Volleyball)
That's right - the volleyball team lays claim to three of the top eight players this week. Cross didn't
reach any career milestones and she wasn't close to putting together a triple-double. But against the
Wildcats, she had more kills than Hunt with a career-high 16. Finishing a game with more kills than
Hunt happens as often as defensive coordinator Greg Robinson talks to the media. All of the contri-
butions from all over the court have the Wolverines sitting pretty atop the Big Ten standings.
SJunior Hemingway, Wide Receiver (Football)
Hemingway bounced back from a poor performance a couple of weeks ago against Michigan State. In
the game against the Hawkeyes, he had more than 100 yards with a touchdown for the second time this
season and seemed to click with Forcier at the helm in the second half He was the Wolverines' biggest
threat during their fourth quarter surge and was one of the reasons the offense scored 28 points on one
of the nation's best defenses. But apparently, four touchdowns and 522 yards (albeit, with four turnovers)
aren't nearly enough for Michigan's defense to work with - even against a defense of that caliber.
MatSchmitt, Forward (Men's Soccer)
Schmitt hasn't left his mark on the score sheet in Michigan's last two losses, but he was a key part of
a four-game winning streak prior to the losses. Coming off the bench, he had a three-game goal scoring
streak of his own, highlighted by the game-winner at Wisconsin a couple of Sundays ago.

Inthe shaded seclusion of Nichols Arbore-
tum, a few shouts break nature's silence.
"Brooms down, eyes closed!" calls out
LSA junior Emily Byl. "The Snitch is released!"
And so begins a game of Michigan Quidditch.
Of course, Quidditch is the beloved wizard
sport in J. K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" books,
but it's sneaking into the Muggle world. The
'U' team is amongthe most recentlyregistered
in the - wait for it - International Quidditch
Association.
"This actually started two summers ago
when my friends and I were really good
friends with someone from Eastern (Michi-
gan University)'s team," Byl said. "We were
looking and looking and trying to find our
Quidditch team, and we realized that it didn't
exist."
In the year that followed, Byl and her
friends familiarized themselves with the IQA
* rulebook, which specifies everything from
forbidden maneuvers to standardized brooms.

In September, they set up a Michigan Quid-
ditch table at Festifall on the Diag.
"Festifall drew way more support than we
had ever fathomed," Byl said. "We realized
there was a niche for it because a couple peo-
ple e-mailed me right when the group started
- whenIregistered thegroup, I got 1Oe-mails
frompeople who were interested - but we had
about 300 people at Festifall register. It was
absurd. Our booth was continuously crowded
with people and we really weren't quite ready
for that capacity of interest."
"To me, it just sounded interesting because
youwonder how they translate thegame," said
LSA freshman Robert Morgan, who signed up
at Festifall. "Obviously we don't have magic
and can't fly, soI was like, 'Wow, how are they
gonna pull this one off?'"
As it turns out, there aren't too many dif-
ferences between the wizard and Muggle ver-
sions of Rowling's sport. College Quidditch
still has seven players: three chasers, two

beaters, a seeker and a keeper. On either end
of the pitch are the goals, each made of three
hula hoops duct-taped to tiki torches and
wedged in the ground. The Quaffle is used to
score, and the Bludgers (three instead of two)
are used to hit and confuse other players. For
these, the Michigan players currently use
dodgeballs featuring Disney characters. The
greatest challenge posed by bringing Quid-
ditch to life is the Snitch.
"The concept behind the Snitch is that it's
essentially ... a runner," Byl explained. "Some-
one dressed in all yellows or bright colors."
The "Snitch Runner" sticks atube sock con-
taining a tennis ball into his or her pants.
"So to catch the Snitch you have to grab the
ball out of the Snitch's pants," Byl said. "The
Snitch can hide, the Snitch can climb trees ...
it's pretty fun."
At the moment, LSA freshman Mark Wag-
ner plays the part of the Snitch. Wagner ran
cross country in high school and participated

in the Detroit Free Press Marathon this past
Sunday, so playing Snitch came easily to him.
"This is a good way to stay in shape," Wag-
ner said. "Igo on runs too, but this way I just
get to run around the Arb and have people
chase me."
Catching the Snitch ends the game and
earns the respective Seeker's team 50 points.
In the books, catching the Snitch is worth
150 points, but the IQA feels that this puts too
much pressure on Seekers and risks trivializ-
ing the rest of the game.
Though the IQA began as the Intercol-
legiate Quidditch Association, it changed
its name to reflect the participation of high
schools and institutions in other countries. To
date, the IQA has registered more than 400
colleges and 300 high schools everywhere
from the United States to New Zealand.
When Byl and her teammates began scrim-
mages in the Arb, the team drew quite a bit of

They're dense, but simple. With this

While Don's busy making his fateful
choice and shocking millions of viewers,
Joan (Christina Hendricks), the firm's
long-suffering office manager, is pro-

The agency signs a new client thanks
to copywriter Peggy Olson (Elisabeth
Moss), yet both accomplishments are
overshadowed by Don's announcement.
Both women bemoan their lack of rec-
ognition in a beautifully acted scene that
embodies the sexism of the '60s. Peggy's
success in particular changes the mood
of the series from morbid to uneasy, as
the agency skates forward on thin ice.

wavering guitar and Lennox's voice, but
the melody never stops moving. After
every phrase, there's a pregnancy to the
pause, filled with impenetrable things
- dialogue, echoed keyboards, the dead
ends of reverb. The melody never rests,
constantly writhing and washing over,
haunting the two minutes it holds before
departing.
Throughout the song, Lennox's words
sound split; "Know you can count on me"
sounds suspiciously like "No, you can't
count on me." If these recent singles have
proven anything, it's that we really can't
count on Panda Bear. And in this case,
that's a good thing.

obligatory "disguised in public" scene.

Most women know what they're
getting into when taking on the job
of demon-slayer - Kelsey Black-
boot is not one of them. Kelsey is
the unpopular girl in school just
try:sg to make some friends.
When she signs up for Students
United Through Faith as an after-
school activity, she's completely
unaware she joined a secret cult
dedicated to saving all of human-
ity - nevermind the fact that the
world's most threatening demon
resides right in her very own high
school. Now Kelsey must train to
become the most bad-ass demon-
slayer and take out the evil legion,
all while trying to pass her algebra
class and not trip in front of the
hunky football captain.
Author Angie Fox is no stranger

many other-realm stories set in
high schools, it'd be easy to just
write off "The Accidental Demon

paperback, but this page-turner is
a surprisingly insightful coming-
of-age story.
The emotional trauma Kelsey
experiences when she realizes her
own terrier, Puddles, is in fact the
Grand King Demon is written with
an honest maturity rarely seen in
Young Adult books. Kelsey's trans-
formation from homely nerd into

for a good mystical read this fall,
put down "Girl with the Dragon

. Poetry speaks to A2 communI
Performance poetry groups U-club and
Wordworks each offer their distinctive
take on the art form
By Carly Steinberger I Daily Arts Writer

A microphone always helps get
your message to the masses. But in
the right hands, a microphone sends
a personal and passionate message
about life, society and struggle -
a message that, while expressed
fine in writing, truly comes alive
in vocal performance. And in Ann
Arbor, the right hands grasp the mic
at U-club's bi-weekly performances.
During the open mic portion of
the Oct. 7 show, a young man took
the stage, ukulele in hand, and pro-
ceeded to play part of the song "5
Years Time" by the band Noah and
the Whale. Another delivered a
poem about perseverance. One more
read a poem praising her roommate.
Anyone can take the stage during
the open mic segment of the show.
They can read whatever they want
- something they've been work-
ing on for months or something
theycompleted in five minutes. The
pieces don't necessarily have to be
poetry, and often they're not.
The poets who competed in the
poetry slam following the open mic
employed several different delivery
styles: Some spoke rapidly and pas-
sionately, while others favored a
somber tone. Five judges - volun-
teers from the audience - were pro-
vided with white boards to rank the
performers on a scale of one to 10.
One competitor solemnly perfor-
mend a poem about rape. Another
shared a poem about being high,
which he performed animatedly,
walking around the stage, throwing
out hand gestures and fluctuating
the volume of his voice. The winner
of the slam presented a clever poem
about the race and class dynam-
ics of being robbed as a white man
in Detroit, which he speedily yet
emphatically performed.
After each slam ends, the fea-
tured poet takes the stage and pres-
ents the audience with a sampling of
his or her work.
Oct. 7's featured poet goes by
the stage name Versiz, though his
real name is Jamaal May. He gave
a powerful performance, putting a
creative, poetic spin on tough topics
like war. Still, harsher themes can
be performed alongside optimism.
"A lot of times I try to perform
encouraging poems," May said.
"You know, poems about possibili-
ties. They are to some extent opti-
mistic but not in a hokey false way."
One of May's chief goals is to
"bring poetry to the people." A pub-
lished poet, May has been asked
to perform at locations like Notre
Dame, Indiana University and, of
course, at U-club.
While the Oct. 7 U-club featured
vastly different performers, one
theme pervaded all of their of work:
self-expression. It was clear most of
the performers wrote about person-
al experiences or greater societal
ideas that sparked their passions.
U-club simply provided the venue.
"It's a really laid back atmosphere
in which anyone can participate,"
said LSA junior Angela Crumdy,
U-club's vice president. "And it's just
a good place if you want to grow as
a poet."
Crumdy talked about some of
the other events the organiza-
tion makes happen. In early Feb-
ruary, for example, U-club holds
the "Penis Monologues" - a show
consisting of penis-themed group
pieces and monologues performed

by men. And the club has started a
slam in conjunction with the Alpha
Phi Alpha fraternity for Black His-
tory Month.
At the end of every slam season,
U-club also hosts a Grand Slam,
in which all the winners of the bi-
weekly slams participate. The top
five scorers comprise the University
of Michigan team that will be sent
to the College Unions Poetry Slam
Invitational, colloquially known as
College Nationals. This year CUPSI
willbe held inAnnArbor; lastyear's
location was Emerson College in
Boston, Massachusetts.
Amariah Stepter is U-club's
president. A fifth-year LSA senior,
Stepter has been involved with
U-club since she was a freshman.
"Performance poetry allows you
to relate more and connect to the
poem," Stepter said, "And instead
of reading it with my own voice and
my own cadence I am visualizing
what (the author) experienced, ver-
sus putting myself in their shoes."
Crumdy generally prefers perfor-
mance poetry to written poems, but
not always.
"For performance poetry, there's
a really big theater aspect and you
have to be able to use your voice as a
tool and your body as tool," Crumdy
said. "On paper you have to do all of
those things and not be present."
Aside from organizing U-club
events and watching them unfold,
Crumdy and Stepter are both poets
themselves.
"I would call myself a poet who
sometimes performs," Crumdy said.
"I write every day - I have a jour-
nal, but it's not necessarily poetry. If
there's certain things I find inspir-
ing I'll write them down."
Crumdy also talked a bit about
recurring subjects in her poems.
She said many of her poems deal
with social justice, but that most of
her poems are just about her life.
"It's a way for me to process
where I come from or things about
my family or things that happen on
campus," she said.
Stepter shared similar thoughts
about her own work.
"I turn daily events into a poem,"
she said. "They don't have a con-
sistent theme. They're just about
things I've been through and my
relationships with other people."
For Crumdy and Stepter, just like
at the slam, it's about start-to-finish
self-expression; from conception to
writing to the stage, the poets' work
truly comes from themselves.
While the U-club slams take
place on campus, there are several
other groups operating around the
Ann Arbor area that specialize
in the spoken word. One of these
groups is Wordworks, which began
in 2002.
"We are a group of people that
are absolutely in love with words
and what putting them together
can mean for ourselves and the
people in our community," said
Maggie Hanks, a Wordworks mem-
her studying education at Eastern
Michigan University.
Wordworks puts on a variety of
events around town, though none
are poetry slams. Rather, they focus
on exposingthe public to the spoken
word.
on the first and third Wednesday
of every month, Wordworks holds
LooseLeaf Writings from 6 to 9 p.m.

This year's College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational will be held in Ann Arbor.

at Ann Arbor's TeaHaus. An estab-
lished poet leads a free workshop
for college-aged and adult writers
of any level. The second Tuesday
of every month, Wordworks holds
LooseLeaf Readings from 6:30 to
9:30 p.m. An open mic follows the
featured poets reading at these
events.
Hanks elaborated on the other
events Wordworks puts on, includ-
ing readings at the Kerrytown Book
Festival and the local teen center
Neutral Zone, along with their
annual show "Homegrown," per-
formed every January at the Lydia
Mendelssohn Theater.
"That one's really cool because
it's sort of a large-scale production
that incorporates music and ensem-
ble pieces as well as just individual
poetry," Hanks said. Homegrown
features the small group of Word-
works members exclusively.
For Hanks, all poetry is perfor-
mance poetry.
"Roger Bonair-Agard (a poet
from Trinidad and Tobago) said
that reading poetry is an inherently
auditory experience," Hanks said,
"because even when you're reading
to yourself from the page the way
that we process words is ... you feel
it and you hear it even if its only in
your head. So there is no poem that
cannot be a performance poem."
This is not a universal belief
among poets. Mike Kulik, ajunior at
Wayne State University and aWord-
works member, offered some of his
thoughts about performance and
written poetry.
"The difference is the artistic ele-
ment. I think spoken word has an
easier way of conveying voice than
writtenword," Kulick said. "Person-
ally, I like the written aspect more.
If someone can read my poetry in
New York City and paint apicture of
Main Street, Ann Arbor, you know
because it's written so well."
Many Wordworks members
began their involvement with per-
formance poetry at the Neutral
Zone, a youth activities center
on Washington St. in Ann Arbor
which hosts weekly poetry gather-

ings under Creative Arts Director
Jeff Kass. The organization is also
responsible for Poetry Night in Ann
Arbor, which will occur on Nov. 4
and feature renowned poets Martin
Espada and Samantha Thornhill.
Kass, an English teacher at Pio-
neer High School, strives to inspire
young people to get involved with
performance poetry with the Neu-
tral Zone's weekly readings.
"I think that young people don't
generally get enough credit for
being as interesting and imagina-
tive as they are," Kass said. To him,
poetry slams and performance
poetry provide an outlet for kids to
show the world what they think and
what they can do.
For Kass's students, performance
poetry gives them a chance to build
writing skills and gain confidence.
The U-club and Wordworks bring
the spoken word to the Univer-
sity and the broader Ann Arbor
community. But for all involved,
performance poetry is a learning
experiencethat's inherentlytied not
just to readingthe written word, but
to listening to what's spoken.

COMPETITIVE SLAM TEAMS IN A2
* Ann Arbor Youth Slam Team: For children under
19 years of age. Coached by Wordworks member
Gal Leberzon through the Neutral Zone, the team
competes in slams tournament-style and attends the
annual Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry

POETRY COLUMN
usiCians: stick to lyrics,
leave poetry to poets

DELICIOUS DESIGNS
Cake is their canvas

ack when I taught high school, a
student - let's call him Dude
wandered into my contemporary
poetry class with a beef to settle. Dude
wasn't actually in my poetry class, but he
heard I had maligned
the artistic integrity of
his favorite poet. His
ethical and aesthetic
code required that he
skip his stats class in
protest.
The poet in ques-
tion? Jim Morrison, DAVID
legendary frontman of LUCAS
the Doors. Morrison __C __
was certainly a liter-
ary sort, naming his
band after Aldous Huxley's "The Doors of
Perception," which was itself taken from a
William Blake phrase. Of course, neither
Huxley nor Blake ever writhed around
half-naked on stage, calling himself the
Lizard King - which may be why there
are so few posters of a shirtless Aldous
Huxley in dorm rooms across the country.
But take away Morrison's brand of cha-
risma, mystery and danger, and what's left
of rock'n'roll? Well, lyrics, for starters:
The old get old and the young get stronger
May take a week and it may take longer
They got the guns but we got the numbers
Coonna win, yeah we're taking over.
("Five to One," 1968)
As poetry, that's decent. I like its jaun-
tiness, the brash ambition necessary for
so many young artists to start careers. I
like it much better with Ray Mazarek's
fuzzy bass lines and harpsichord, and
Morrison's voice sounding lost in an echo
chamber.
Lyrics are one thing. Now try these
lines from Morrison's poem "The Opening
of the Trunk" (1967-1971):
I'm Me!
Can you dig it.
My meat is real.
My hands-how they move
balanced like lithe demons
My hair-so twined and writhing
The skin of my face-pinch the cheeks
My flaming sword tongue
spraying verbal fire-flys
I'm real.
Some of this is OK - the internal rhyme
of "lithe" with "twined and writhing" -
but the rest is an egomaniacal mess. My
meat is real? A tongue - wait, a "flaming
sword tongue" - that sprays ... what was
it? Oh yes, "fire-flys." Flaming sword
tongue? Is this "Dungeons and Dragons?"
It's not just Morrison. My personal
musical hero, Bob Dylan, is just as guilty. I
don't know of a lyricist better than Dylan,
whose lines have shown up in everything
from the scholarship of Oxford don Chris-
topher Ricks to the written opinions of
Chief Justice John Roberts. From the sec-
ond verse of 1965's "Subterranean Home-
sick Blues:"
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tiptoes
Don't try "No-Doz"
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows

Now look what happens when Dylan
tries to write poems - or an experimental
novel - or whatever 1971's "Tarantula" is
supposed to be:
aretha/ crystal jukebox queen of hymn &
him diffused in drunk transfusion wound
would heed sweet soudwave crippled &
cry salute to oh great particular el dorado
reel & ye battered personal god but she can-
not she the leader of whom when ye follow,
she cannot she has no back she cannot ...
And that's how it starts. It's just not the
same without the screeching harmonica,
the nasal sneer Philip Larkin called "that
cawing, derisive voice."
Whatever the reason, pop musicians
seem obsessed with poetry. In the last 15
years, we've seen books of poems arrive
from Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pump-
kins, Paul McCartney, Tupac Shakur,
Wilco's Jeff Tweedy and, of course, Jewel.
The results have been mixed.
Luckily for musicians, lyrics aren't bur-
dened with having to make sense. They
have music to support them. Take my
favorite lines from Elton John:
La
Laalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
("Crocodile Rock," 1972)
That's not much on the page, but the
music will have you crocodile rocking
well past your own threshold for annoy-
ance. This, of course, is the secret. A good
melody can support and redeem even the
most nonsensical babbling (see Dave Mat-
thews Band). Poetry, on the other hand,
has nothing to support it but the language
it's made of and the sound of the human
voice. So poets must be much more par-
ticular about choosing words that are
not only "deep," but also make music by
sounding beautiful.
Maybe that's why the most successful
crossovers start with poetry and move
into music. The best of these is probably
Leonard Cohen, who possesses the voice
I imagine God to have. Cohen published a
book of poems, "Let Us Compare Mythol-
ogies," at the age of 22, before he ever
stepped into a recording studio. Pulitzer
Prize-winner Paul Muldoon collaborated
with the late Warren Zevon, and David
Berman of the Silver Jews received an
MFA from the University of Massachu-
setts. His book of poems, "Actual Air"
(1999), is actually good.So are Patti
Smith's poems, but then she does just
Please put away your
flaming tongue.
about everything right.
So I'm sorry, Dude, but you'll have to go
back to matching up Dark Side ofthe Moon
with "The Wizard of Oz," or scouring
the cover ofAbbey Road to learn whether
Paul's really dead. (He's not - just really
lame.) Maybe, if you listen closely, you can
even discover who shot Tupac. There's
poetry in these mysteries, and even music
could use a little poetry sometimes.

Cupcake Station and
Cake Nouveau indulge
A2's sweet tooth
ByJENNIFERXU
Daily Arts Writer
A walk inside Cupcake Station on East
Liberty Street in Ann Arbor feels like a
scene out of a Brothers Grimm fairytale:
the hand-chalked sign outside announc-
ing "Monday Madness" and "Frosting
Friday," the aroma of fresh vanilla bean
and cake batter that hits you once the
door swings open, the giant tubs of col-
ored icing stacked against the wall, the
miniature bar stools lining the counter.
And the centerpiece - the row of neatly
lined cupcakes beneath the display case,
tipsy with sprinkle-flecked frosting,
with little paper tags announcing their
flavors: "Fall Into Pumpkin," "Southern
Red Velvet," "Vanilla Petals."
Cake decorator Sarah Ternes sits at
the counter, wielding a massive tube of
icing in one hand and a tray of newly
frosted cupcakes in the other.
Ternes scoops up a cloud of white
chocolate buttercream from the tub
behind her. It drops softly into the icing
tube. She holds the tip vertically over
an unfrosted chocolate cupcake, easily
swirling the frosting onto the cake's sur-
face in a matter of seconds.
"We can pretty much do anything
(customers) want," she said, crafting a
purple buttercream flower off to the side.
"We can do letters, roses, drop flowers,
petals, leaves, grass, fruits, dots. It just
depends on what they want."
While the Cupcake Station special-
izes in daintier confections, Cake Nou-
veau on North 4th Avenue, owned by
Food Network star Courtney Clark, has
elaborate tiered wedding confections.
Cake construction begins with a series of
sit-down or e-mail sessions between the
client and one of Cake Nouveau's consul-
tants.
Clark then takes the sketches from the
consultation and tries to replicate them
in cake form, sometimes adding a bit of
her own inspiration into the mix and
making her cake decorating an artform.
For Ternes at the Cupcake Station
- which also sells cakes - decorating
baked goods is more ofa family tradition,
she explained while putting the finishing
touches on her sample flower, the petals
looking like little pearl droplets curling
atop the wax paper.
"My great aunt was actually a cake
decorator, so I got started when I was
pretty young," she said. "I would go to
her house to hang out, and I would start
to pick up on a couple things ... Then
when I moved here, I found a job on
Craigslist that was advertising for a cake
decorator, and I was like, 'I'd like to get
back into that!'"
Ternes typically comes to work when
the store opens with a huge batch of
unfrosted cupcakes waiting for her and
steadily works her way through them
until the end of the day. The cupcakes
are made earlier that morning by the
store's bakers, but while warm cupcakes
may sound delicious, they usually don't
end up being the prettiest.
"If the cupcakes are a little warm from
the oven, you just wait until they're cool
to the touch," she said. "If they're too
warm, the frosting will start melting all
over the top, and it's just a big mess."
Instead of frosting, Cake Nouveau

Cake Nouveau is owned by Food Network star Courtney Clark.

promises each client a custom-designed
cake rolled in mounds of stretchy fon-
dant and finished off with a series of
molding chocolate or gum paste sculp-
tures.
"Fondant is basically sugar Play-Doh,"
Mayfield said. "It comes in a bucket. You
can stretch it, twist it, roll it out, make it
into a ball - you can literally do anything
with it."
"The difference between gum paste
and fondant is that fondant doesn't dry
hard," she added. "Gum paste is meant to
dry hard so you can make separate sculp-
tures with it."
The cake is generally baked 48 hours
before the date of the order by a special
pastry chef. The interior is usually filled
with a buttercream or chocolate ganache
frosting.
"It's really just your typical sponge
cake, chocolate or vanilla," she said. "But
we can add additional flavors - lemon or
lime or mint."
All of Cupcake Station's frostings are
homemade and usually consist of a but-
tercream or cream cheese base. The tubs
behind Ternes read "Peanut Butter But-
tercream," "Lemon White Chocolate"
and "White Chocolate Cream Cheese."
The cupcakes are then finished with a
decorative topper - usually a butter-
cream flower, a few douses of multicol-
ored sprinkles or a drizzle of caramel.
"Sometimes we mix different things
in the buttercream in order to get dif-
ferent flavors," Ternes said. "The butter-
cream is easiest to work with. The cream
cheese is a little thicker, so sometimes
it's a little more difficult to use."
Cupcake Station also provides peo-
ple with a special custom cupcake ser-
vice for weddings, holidays and special

events. People who come in for wedding
tastings get six to eight cupcakes for free
to try some of the different flavors and
frosting combinations.
The store also bakes larger cakes on
request, which can be tiered or unilay-
ered. Ternes outlined the difficulties
with decorating each type of cake.
"It depends on what you want to
do," she said. "Cupcakes can be easier
because they're smaller to work with and
a lot of times people just want something
really simple - you put something on
there and it looks really cute. But if they
want something bigger, like flowers or
letters, it's easier to do it on a cake."
To achieve the exquisite intricacies
found in Cake Noveau's creations, Clark
does not use the kinds of cake tools that
one would find at IKEA or Williams-
Sonoma.
"This one she uses to thin the fondant
out so that can get ripply and crease-
y. This one she likes to use when she's
doing indentations for a person's face,"
Mayfield said, pulling out a bevy of cake
tools that resemble large plastic tooth-
picks. "They're all just - there's no name
for these. They're just special cake tools."
Whatever the tools or ingredients or
sizes involved in fashioning their respec-
tive cakes, these two locally owned des-
sert stores have won the hearts of Ann
Arborites, not just through their outside
decorations but also for their decadent
flavors underneath. One bite into Cup-
cake Station's "Boston Cream Cake,"
a cupcake covered in a dark chocolate
ganache and drizzled with white choco-
late and a sweet pink buttercream flow-
er, reveals an even sweeter vanilla bean
interior soaked ina rich creamy custard.
If only all artwork were this delicious.

asked if the players were playing broomball
at an early practice. When she heard it was
Quidditch, she just had to watch.
"She said, 'My son would love this,' and
so she and a couple of other families came
to watch the game with their kids," Byl
said. "Obviously for us, it's to bring the
books to life. It was cool to bring the books
to life for them as well."
The team hopes to attract a fan follow-
ing for its upcoming games against Eastern

Michigan and Michigan State. The EMU
game will be in the Arb on Oct. 34 at 3 p.m.
Michigan will play MSU on Nov. 7, same
time and place.
"It's very entertaining to watch. We
really love having crowds. People do try to
get into the role of being wizards and not
Muggles," Byl said.
Before the big games, official tryouts
will take place Sunday, Oct. 24 at 3 p.m.
in the Arb. Until then, players practice by
scrimmaging each other with the names of
Quidditch teams from the books.
"Our first game was Gryffindor versus
Slytherin," said LSA sophomore Danica
Whitfield, who plays the position of Beat-
er. "People come dressed up; we have Sly-

therin people who paint their faces and
make t-shirts, and we have Gryffindor
people who decorate brooms and have that
whole house rivalry going on."
In the followingweek,teams were named
after professional Quidditch teams from
the world of "Harry Potter": the Applebee
Arrows and the Chudley Cannons. Byl and
her teammates enjoy these subtle nods at
Rowling's universe as a reminder of what
brought them all together.
"Everyone here is really pumped to play
Quidditch," said LSA sophomore Camille
Duet, who plays Chaser.
"No one's here because they have a Quid-
ditch scholarship," Duet added.
"You just get to nerd out with other

people," Whitfield added. "You can't really
express your love for Quidditch so much in
a classroom. When you're on the field you
can be like, 'Oh, this is just like in the book!'
... and you can actually do it because you're
playing."
Byl agreed that actually playing Quid-
ditch is a great way to make Rowling's fic-
tion into reality. "I have tried to bring the
books alive in many different ways. This is
kind of the easiest way because when you're
caught up in the game it's easy to kind of -"
"- immerse yourself," Whitfield fin-
ished.
"When I was first conceiving this idea I
definitely did go back and reread some of
the Quidditch scenes in the early books,"
