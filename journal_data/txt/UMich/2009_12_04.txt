* GOVERNING THE GREEKS
Greeks mull
changes to
risk policies
Now the function solely of
fraternities, party oversight could
include greater sorority role
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
In an effort to create a safer party environment,
members of the Interfraternity Council and Panhel-
lenic Association are considering new ways for mem-
bers of sororities to take a more active role in risk
management at parties.
Though national sorority policies for each of the
houses are a complex set of varying rules and regu-
lations, Greek Life officials think that by working
together a system can be devised that would allow the
sororities involved in IFC-sponsored parties to shoul-
der some of the risk associated with hosting a party.
Panhel Vice President of Social Responsibility
Michelle March said a task force was created to con-
sider how to have a more even distribution of respon-
sibility between the men and women in Greek Life and
to enhance the overall safety of the registered events.
"The Panhellenic Executive Board is extremely
invested in promoting the safety and health of all our
Greek members," she said. "We feel this can best be
accomplished by having women in more active risk
management positions at registered events."
But these changes could conflict with national
sorority organizations' policies about placing women
in more active risk management roles.
According to Linda Kahangi, executive director of
the national organization of the Alpha Phi Fraternity,
Alpha Phi has a few standing rules that might make

Little action on proposal to create Milano receives minimal

" Monroe St. pedestrian walkway

University request
has been pending
before City Council
for more than a year
By JOELLE HECKER
For theDaily
Though ground has broken and
construction is underway on the
Law School's new academic build-
ing, plans to close the block of
Monroe Street between the Law
Quad and this new academic build-
ing and replace it with a pedestrian
mall are far from fruition.
University officials proposed
the construction of a pedestrian
mall on Monroe Street between
South State Street and Oakland

Avenue approximately one year
ago. However, officials admit that
much still needs to be done before
the pedestrian mall can become a
reality.
Jim Kosteva, director of commu-
nity relations at the University, said
the request to close off the block
has been pending before the Ann
Arbor City Council for more than
a year.
"Our request is still pending in
front of the city authorities, and we
are awaiting a hearing before the
City Planning Commission," Koste-
va said in an interview yesterday.
If the City Council approves the
proposal, upgrades to area utili-
ties would be needed, Kosteva said,
including improvements to nearby
waterlines.
Kosteva said local traffic is
another point of consideration,

since some Ann Arbor residents
believea change to the street would
create traffic problems at other
locations in the immediate vicinity.
However, Kosteva said he's not
concerned about any potential traf-
fic problems and doesn't believe the
traffic changes would impact local
citizens.
"The traffic analysis that we
had done gave us enough comfort
to say that, 'Yes there's bound to
be changes in the traffic patterns,
but none, in our view, that would
cause such a significant disruption
or have a significant impact to the
area,'" Kosteva said.
No specific funding source for
the project has been identified,
though Kosteva said University
resources and fundraising efforts
would support the project.

LAW SCHOOL DEATH
Missing Law School student's body found

Former Michigan football play-
er Mike Milano had tears of joy in
his eyes as he received a minimal
sentence in Washtenaw County
Circuit Court yesterday for an
aggravated assault conviction he
was found guilty of in October.
Milano was sentenced to pay a
$200 fine and other court costs for
his Oct. 22 misdemeanor convic-
tion.
The charge stems from an
incident that occurred outside of
Rick's American Caf6 on Oct. 12,
2008 that left Michigan hockey
player Steve kampfer in the hos-
piral with closed-head injuries.
Milano confronted Rampfer for
being physically aggressive with
Kampfer's former girlfriend out-
side of the bar.

35-year-old student
committed suicide

Daily News Editor
Casey McGinnis, the 35-year
old Law School student who was
reported missing on Nov. 12, was
found dead in Ann Arbor earlier
this week after he took his own
life.
Law School Associate Dean
David Baum sent an e-mail to
members of the Law School com-

munity yesterday afternoon to
inform students.
"We know this is very sad news
to hear at a particularly difficult
time of year," Baum wrote to stu-
dents. and faculty. "Our heartfelt
condolences go out to Casey's fam-
ily and to those of you within our
community who came to know
Casey during his time here."
According to Baum's e-mail,
McGinnis's family posted a mes-
sage to friends and supporters on
his Facebook wall Wednesday.
"Our hearts are broken and the
sadness is profound," the family's
posting read. "Please give us time
to get our bearing and adjust to the

situation."
Law School officials are making
themselves available to students
who want to talk to someone about
the situation. Additionally, coun-
selors at the University's Coun-
seling and Psychological Services
office have been made aware of the
situation and are available to talk
with students on a walk-in basis
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday
through Thursday.
Baum told students in his
e-mail that he is not aware of
any plans for a memorial service,
but promised to keep students
apprised as more information
becomes available.

Congress worries about
Obama's plan for Pakistan

.

Obama and
Congress recently
approved a $7.5B
Pakistan aid package
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fac-
ing the prospect of more Ameri-
can deaths in Afghanistan as
the war escalates, lawmakers
lashed out at neighboring Paki-
stan on yesterday as an unreli-
able ally that could spare the
U.S. its bruising fight with al-
Qaida if it wanted.
"They don't seem to want a
strategic relationship," New
Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob
Menendez said of the govern-
ment in Islamabad. "They want
the money. They want the equip-
ment. But at the end of the day,
they don't want a relationship
that costs them too much."
A crucial ally in fighting the
al-Qaida terrorist network, Paki-
stan is also a major recipient of
U.S. aid. President Barack Obama
and Congress recently approved
a $7.5 billion aid package for eco-
nomic and social programs in
Pakistan in a bid to strengthen
the civilian government there.
.ut many in Congress have
grown skeptical that Islamabad
is doing all it can to drive out
al-Qaida forces hiding along its
mountainous Afghan border.
Those doubts reached a new
pitch this week after Obama's
announcement that he will
send 30,000 more U.S. troops to
Afghanistan by next fall, with the
anticipation that they would start
coming home in July 2011.
Obama has not said whether
or how the troop buildup would
accelerate attacks on the terror-
ist network hiding in Pakistan.
The U.S. has previously relied on
drone-launched missile strikes,
and those operations are classi-
fied.
"It is not clear how an expand-
ed military effort in Afghanistan
addresses the problem of Taliban
and al-Qaida safe havens across
the border in Pakistan," said Sen.
Richard Lugar, the top Republi-
can on the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee.
Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri,

a leading conservative Demo-
crat, said Obama's strategy was
the nation's best shot but that
Pakistan could end the war if it
wanted.
"Conversely, if Pakistan wdre
to return to old habits of sup-
porting the Afghan Taliban, the
war may be almost impossible to
win," he said.
Obama has sought to assure
lawmakers - and the rest of the
world - that he sees Pakistan
inextricably linked to Afghani-
stan. In his speech on Tues-
day, the president said both
governments were "endangered"
because of al-Qaida.
"The stakes are even higher
within a nuclear-armed Pakistan,
because we know that al-Qaida
and other extremists seek nucle-
ar weapons, and we have every
reason to believe that they would
use them," he said in his speech
from West Point.
Testifying for the second day
on Obama's new war plan, the
president's chief military and
diplomatic advisers said Pakistan
was a critical component of the
strategy.
"We have a lot of work to do
in trying to convince them that
we're not trying to take over their
country, that we're not trying
to take control of their nuclear
weapons, and that we are actual-
ly interested in a long-term part-
nership with them," said Defense
Secretary Robert Gates.
Several Democrats, including
Menendez and Sen. Russ Feingold
of Wisconsin, have threatened to
withhold their support for more
money for the war, although law-
makers said it was unlikely that
Congress would try to block the
deployments. Instead, members
from both parties say they want
to find a way to pay for the troop
increase that won't add to the
deficit.
In a press conference yester-
day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
said she did not support a pro-
posal by Wisconsin Democratic
Rep. David Obey that would have
imposed a war tax on most Amer-
icans.
Pelosi, D-Calif., said the first
step should be an all-hands brief-
ing to Congress by Obama's top
advisers.

"We have to handle it with
care, listen to what they pres-
ent, and then members will make
their decision," she said.
The results of the billions in
U.S.. aid to Pakistan have been
mixed. While the army has taken
on the Pakistani Taliban, it has
failed to go after Afghan Taliban
leaders who base their operations
in the tribal areas in the border
region. At the same time, anti-
Western sentiment in Pakistan
has grown.
Many Western officials and
analysts believe Pakistan is play-
ing both sides - accepting U.S.
money to crack down on mili-
tants while tolerating the Afghan
Taliban in case the radical Islam-
ic movement gains control in
Afghanistan once the American
troops withdraw.
Officials estimate there are
500 al-Qaida fighters and 50,000
Taliban militants in Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
For its part, Pakistan has
been cautious in its response to
Obama's plan. In London yes-
terday, Prime Minister Yousuf
Raza Gilani declined to endorse
the U.S.-led troop increase and
said his government needs more
information.
Gates said he initially opposed
the idea of a troop increase
because he feared it would make
the U.S. footprint in Afghanistan
too heavy. He said he also was
hesitant to set a timeline on when
troop withdrawals would begin.
But he said he was ultimate-
ly convinced by Gen. Stanley
McChrystal, the top U.S. com-
mander in Afghanistan, that the
size of the force was less impor-
tant than the mission troops
would be given. His colleagues
also convinced him that setting a
date to start withdrawals would
help encourage the Afghans to
take more responsibility, Gates
said.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton today will take the
administration's case for esca-
lating the war to NATO's top
council, where McChrystal will
attend a foreign ministers meet-
ing. Clinton said she expects the
allies to make new troop con-
tributions in the 5,000 to 7,000
range.

Man's false 911
call fails to divert
police during high
speed car chase
A Macomb County man is jailed
after police say he tried to divert
them by calling 911 to report a non-
existent crime while being chased
in a stolen truck.
Sheriff Mark Hackel says
26-year-old Jesse Eden of Shelby
Township is being held on $100,000
bond after his arraignment yester-
day on charges including filing a
false police report and possession
of stolen property.
Hackel says a deputy tried to
stop Eden after he allegedly stole a
bottle of liquor Monday from a store
in Washington Township, about 30
miles north of Detroit. The sheriff
says Eden drove off and called 911
to falsely report an armed robbery
and shooting.
Hackel says the chase ended in
Troy in Oakland County when the
truck hit another vehicle and over-
turned. No serious injuries were
reported.
MEDFORD, Ore.
Tree hunters
stranded in snow
Keith and Jennifer Lee were
driving home on a remote moun-
tain road, their prized Christ-
mas tree strapped to the roof of
their all-wheel-drive, when they
rounded a backcountry corner and
found themselves suddenly mired
in snow.
Out of cell phone range, and
unaware a search was under way,
the couple spentthree days and two
cold nights before Keith Lee finally
freed the Subaru and drove home,
the tree still tied on top.
They soon heard radio news
reports about a search that had
begun Wednesday with ahelicopter,
Sno-Cats and ATVs. They called 9i,
then phoned a close friend who was
taking care of their four children.
"I screamed, 'They're safe,
they're coming home,"' said the
friend, Sophie Smith. "Everybody
just fell and cried."
Just like thousands of Orego-
nians each year, the Lees bought a
Christmas tree permit from their
local national forest office and
headed out Tuesday morning to
find the perfect tree - a silver-tip
fir that only grows at high eleva-
tion, just like the one they got a
year ago.

Border agents
seize $1.6M in
counterfeit toys
Officials have seized thousands

U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection says the toys included
more than 2,500 knockoff Barbie
dolls, worth $58,500, that were

contained in boxes shipped to San
Diego in October and November.
At the Otay Mesa border point,
agents seized 3,100 battery-oper-
ated toy vehicles bearing fake
"Jeep" labels in October.
The manufacturer of the toy
vehicles, which were designed for
kids to drive, did not have permis-

Australian man
dives into jellyfish
A man dove face-first into an
extremely venomous, peanut-sized
jellyfish in waters off northeast
Australia and medics flew him to a
hospital intensive care unit to treat
the potentially fatal sting, officials
said Friday.
The 29-year-old man, whose
name has not been released, was
on a yacht yesterday off northeast
Queensland state. As a precaution,
he waswearingafull-length "sting-
er suit," a lightweight version of a
wetsuit that covers everything but
the face, feet and hands and helps
protect against venomous jellyfish
that are common in northern Aus-
tralia's waters during the Southern
Hemisphere summer.
But when he dove into the water
near South Molle Island, he was
immediately stung in the face by a
potentially lethal Irukandji jelly-
fish, Central Queensland Helicop-
ter Rescue Service spokeswoman
Leonie Hansen said. He was taken
back to the island, where a rescue
team rushed to his aid.

ruption and election fraud. Some
leaders are waiting for an interna-
tional conference on Afghanistan
in London in late January before
promising any more troops.
Asked about the criticism that
has focused on Obama's decision
to announce a date in 2011 to begin
the withdrawal of American troops
from Afghanistan, Clinton said that
it has been misunderstood by some
and that others were simply seek-
ing to create a controversy.
"There have been some mis-
understandings about what that

date meant," she said, referring to
Obama's announcement that begin-
ning in July 2011, the U.S. troop
contingent would begin to be with-
drawn. The administration has said

assessment of conditions on the
ground, starting with an adminis-
tration review in December 2010.
"Some people seized on that, for
whatever reason or lack of under-
standing, as a way to try to create a
difference where I'm not sure there
is one," Clinton said.

She also took a gentle stab at the
Bush administration's approach to
running the war. She said Afghani-
stan's defense chiefhad,toldherlast
month that for the first time he felt
like a full participant in the NATO
military structure, as a result of
changes made by McChrystal, who
was appointed to the top command
by Obama several months after he
took office. Referring to the more
limited Afghan participationbefore
McChrystal's arrival, she said,
"That's a little bit discouraging,
when one looks back."

Karzai supports
troop withdrawal
deadline for US

Afghan president
calls for direct talks
with Taliban's leader
KABUL (AP)-PresidentHamid
Karzai put a brave face yesterday
on President Barack Obama's deci-
sion to start pulling out troops in
mid-2011, telling The Associated
Press in his first public response
that it will push Afghans to take
control of their own destiny.
But he blamed the United States
for stalling peace overtures in the
past and offered to talk directly
with the Taliban's top leader.
Karzai appeared relaxed and
confidentthroughoutthe exclusive
AP interview - the Afghan presi-
dent's first remarks since Obama's
announcement Tuesday that he
will send 30,000 more U.S. troops
to Afghanistan by next fall with
the anticipation that they would
start coming home in July 2011.
Karzai said the deadline, just 18
months away, is "not a concern for
us - it is rather an impetus."

"For Afghans it's good that we
are facing a deadline," he said.
"We must begin to stand on our
own feet. Even if it is with our own
meager means - whatever those
means may be. And we must begin
to defend our own country.
"If we, the Afghan people, can-
not defend our country, ourselves,
against an aggressor from within
or without, then no matter what
the rest of the world does with us,
it will nowt produce the desired
results," he said during the one-
hour interview at the turreted
brick palace in the heavily guarded
heart of the Afghan capital, Kabul.
Republicans have objected to
the setting of a hard deadline
for withdrawing troops for fear
it would encourage the Taliban
to play a waiting game and say
Obama must be willing to delay
the start of a pullout if security
deteriorates..
But Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and Defense Secretary
Robert Gates told U.S. lawmakers
yesterday that the July 2011 date
is flexible.

Employers cut 130, 000 jobs in November - 70,000 fewer than in October. Forecasters estimate,however, that the unem-
ployment rate will remain at a 26-year high rate of 10.2 percent.
Unemployment levels drop but
expected to remain high in 2010

Economy predicted
to make steady but
slow recovery
WASHINGTON (AP) - New
unemployment claims have fallen
for a fifth straight week, boosting
expectations that the economy
shed fewer jobs in November and
remains on a path to recovery.
That optimism was tempered,
though, by signs yesterday that
the rebound will be slower and
bumpier than those that followed
previous recessions. Both retail
sales and activity in the service
sector unexpectedly shrank last
month as consumers remained
anxious about their jobs and hesi-
tant to spend.
The surprise dip in the service
sector was worrisome, because
this area accounts for nearly 80
percent of the nation's economic
activity. It includes such diverse
industries as health care, retail,
financial services and transpor-
tation.
Productivity gains in the third
quarter also showed that employ-
ers are managingto squeeze more
work out of fewer workers. That's
a potentially ominous sign for
the nearly 16 million unemployed
Americans.
Nigel Gault, chief U.S. econo-
mist at IHS Global Insight, said
the reports depicted an economy
growing but only sluggishly.
"We have got a recovery, but
it is going to remain pretty slow
and well below what you would
normally see coming out of this
deep of a recession," Gault said.
Most worrisome for the econ-
omy, perhaps, is that consumers

- who drive 70 percent of the
economy - continue to limit their
spending.
The latest evidence was the
miserable November the nation's
big chain retail stores reported
yesterday. After posting two
monthly gains after more than a
year of declines, the stores said
sales dipped last month - a criti-
cal decline because it meant the
holiday shopping season got off to
a lackluster start.
The more positive news yester-
day was the Labor Department's
report that the number of newly
laid-off workers filing for unem-
ployment benefits fell for a fifth
consecutive week. It dropped to
a seasonally -'adjusted 457,000
last week. That's the lowest total
since the week of Sept. 6, 2008.
The government is expected
to report today that employers
shed 130,000 jobs in Novem-
ber, fewer than the 190,000 jobs
lost in October. But forecasters
think the unemployment rate
will remain at 10.2 percent, a
26-year high.
PresidentBarackObamakicked
off a White House jobs forum
yesterday, saying he was "open to
every demonstrably good idea" to
reverse the rising tide of job loss-
es. But with limited government
resources, the private sector ulti-
mately will have to lead.
"We have to be surgical, and
we're going to have to be cre-
ative," Obama said.
Companies have been laying
off fewer workers. But they have
yet to ramp up hiring, and the
jobless rate is expected to keep
climbing, probably hitting 10.5
percent or higher by the middle
of next year.

The government's productiv-
ity report said output per hour of
work shot up at an annual rate of
8.1 percent in the July-September
period. It was the sharpest quar-
terly increase in six years. For now,
that means companies can get by
without hiring more workers.
The question is how long they
can do so. Nigel Gault, an econo-
mist at IHS.Global Insight, said
companies are reaching the lim-
its of their ability to boost output
with scaled-down work forces.
Gault expects employers to
begin rehiring in coming months
to meet customer demand. That
would help sustain the recovery,
because it would bolster incomes
and encourage more consumers
to spend. Many analysts say the
economy should begin seeing net
job growth sometime early next
year.
For now, shoppers are being
held back not only by job anxi-
ety but by low wages. Over the
12 months that ended in October,
wages and salaries - the most
vital component of incomes -
fell 2.9 percent, the Commerce
Department said last week.
Partly because of that, Gault
forecast that the overall economy,
as measured by the gross domes-
tic product, will limp along at
subpar rates of about 2.5 percent
through mid-2010. High unem-
ployment, which has depressed
wages and consumers' ability to
spend, will continue to restrain
the economy, he said.
On Wall Street, a late-day slide
pulled stocks lower ahead of the
jobs report today. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 86.53, or
0.8 percent. Other stock averages
also dropped.

Majoring inmarijuana
Med Grow is succeeding where government has failed
In the 2008 election, Michigan voters legalized medical mari-
juana. Though a positive development for suffering patients
who can use marijuana to ease their pain, the new law left
many unanswered questions about how eligible persons would
obtain the drug. But one way to get those answers is to enroll in the
new Med Grow Cannabis College in Southfield. Educating Michi-
gan residents about how to grow and use marijuana in conjunc-
tion with this law is important, and other institutions, both public
and private, should follow Med Grow's example. This includes the
state government, which has an obligation to provide a forum for
education on medical marijuana use.

While not a college in the traditional
sense, Med Grow offers a six-week cur-
riculum that teaches students about the
history of cannabis, methods of horticul-
ture and legal regulations of the treat-
ment. The program, which launched last
April and costs about $475, is intended
for caregivers - those who grow and sell
marijuana to patients - and the patients
themselves. Med Grow is even receiving
national attention - earlier this week, The
New York Times wrote a story about the
college.
Med Grow is a useful tool for people
who want to take advantage of the one-
year-old law, because even though medical
marijuana is suddenly legal doesn't mean
people know how to use or grow it. This is
a behavior that has only been permissible
in secret by a limited group of individuals
who are knowledgeable about the drug.
Bringing medical marijuana use aboveg-
round requires education.'
And educating people on how to use
and grow-medical marijuana canonly be
good for the people of Michigan. For one
thing, marijuana relieves the suffering of
sick people. As a pain reliever, marijuana
benefits injured and sick people who may
not react well to other pain relievers and
shouldn't feel discouraged about obtain-
ing relief. This is, after all, the reason that
medical marijuana was placed on the bal-
lot and approved in 2008.
That primary purpose .aside, increased
medical marijuana growth is also an eco-
nomic opportunity for the state. This is
important because the state's promis-

ing industries have begun to dwindle as
of late. But like California, another state
with progressive marijuana laws, Michi-
gan has the chance to pioneer an industry
that will likely grow across the country as
laws continue to become less restrictive.
People should feel empowered to partici-
pate in this up-and-coming sector of the
state economy.
But while Med Grow is leading the way
in the private sector, it's filling a void that
the state government created by failing to
deal with the legal ramifications of medi-
cal marijuana when it was approved last
year. The fact that there hasn't been any
direction coming from state government
is a shame. State authorities should be
offering classes and training sessions. The
government needs to follow Med Grow's
example and fulfill its role as an educator
for the public good.
With the state economy in such trouble,
national news outlets haven't had particu-
larly good things to say about Michigan
lately. But the fact that this state is leading
the way on marijuana reform is attract-
ing attention of a more progressive kind
- something unusually refreshing. As
marijuana laws continue to head toward
greater permissiveness, the state will ben-
efit from keeping ahead of the curve.
Concerns may exist that increased gov-
ernment advocacy of marijuana will one
day snowball into the total legalization of
marijuana. With any hope, these concerns
will prove true and marijuana usage will
finally become a universally accepted legal
activity.

ver Thanksgiving break,
I had an argument with a
white woman - let's call
her "Susan." She
made an off-hand
comment refer-
ring to Mexicans
crosing the bor-
der: "We should
blow them all up
with bazookas."
If I had been wise,
I would have
retreated some- MATTHEW
where far, far
away. But instead, HUNTER
I spent the next
two hours trying
to convince her
that this viewpoint is destructive
to humanity. She claimed that she
wasn't racist because she had a few
close black friends, but that Mexi-
cans are taking over with their dirty
criminality.
In vain, I attempted to describe to
Susan the process by which whites
white men and their ideologies
have dominated our world's most
prominent social spaces. The real-
ity of those who have actually "taken
over" throughout history is that that
they have colonized, forced entire
countries into poverty and corrup-
tion, enslaved millions, tortured
civilians, women and children and
committed war crimes. For exam-
ple, President John F. Kennedy was
notoriously decorated for supporting
human rights, but authorized chemi-
cal warfare in Vietnam. I left Susan
with one question: What if you were
one the oppressed?
Over the past few months, I
have addressed the linked modern
oppression of blacks, gays, Mexi-
cans and the disabled. That is not to
say that racial struggles are really
class struggles, or that gays' issues
should only be discussed in the con-
text of feminism. Rather, it means
we share a common ground in which

the essence of what it means to be
human is challenged by the frame-
work of our physical, mental, sex-
ual or social characteristics. I am
reminded the refrain from a song
titled "Dead Man's Party:" "Wel-
come to a dead man's party, who can
ask for more, everybody's coming,
leave your body at the door." None of
these characteristics, none of these
"bodies," measure value as a human.
In his article, "Transgender Rhet-
orics," teacher and self-identified
queer feminist compositionist Jona-
than Alexander reveals one of his
techniques of teaching gender issues
to his "traditionally" gendered stu-
dents. He knows that while some peo-
ple can relate to the movingstories of
transgender and feminist literature,
others' sentiments are less tolerant.
They ask insensitive questions like,
"Who cares ifa few freaks have trou-
ble using public toilets?" That's the
same as asking who cares that a few
disabled people need to search for a
ramp or access for a few extra min-
utes, who cares if gays do not have
access to the same rights as married
straights and who cares if blacks and
women don't have equal opportunity
of access to education.
Alexander designed a writing
exercise in which students must
write in the voice of one's opposite
sex within a plot designed by a part-
ner. He wanted students to virtually
reflect on the process of gender/sex
switching to see what it might tell
us about the construction of gender
in our society. After it was over, the
discussion that followed conspicu-
ously revealed reliance on sexist ste-
reotypes to understand the opposite
sex. He was asking the same ques-
tion I asked Susan, who also relied
on racist stereotypes to understand
Mexicans.
Similarly, we must begin to ques-
tion our own stereotypical notions of
other groups that shape our inaccu-
rate and often offensive understand-

ings. We must consider ourselves
gay before we oppose equal right for
gays; or women, before we decide
when, where, why and how they
birth a child. What would we want
for ourselves, if we were in their
place? When looking at vast social
disparities that still exist, we must
remember 500 years of slavery and
a system that has segregated blacks
into our poorest cities. Imagine you
are an unemployed, poor black man
in Detroit, where there are no jobs
and your family is starving. The only
option available for money was sell-
ing drugs. Wouldn't you do it? Or
would you let your family go hun-
gry? For oppressed social minori-
ties, gaining basic human rights is
about a struggle to survive.

Rather than identify with some
external characteristic with which
our identities have been defined by
society's dominant forces, we can
transform society by understanding
what is means to be human. As bell
hooks tells us in her book, "Talking
Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking
Black," we must be "challenging the
politics of domination on all fronts."
By leaving our bodies at the door and
identifying with minorities who our
society as a whole does not under-
stand, we can find the common
ground that makes us all human and
begin to oppose the dominant forces
that corrupt the notion of a common
humanity.

Laughing at the holidays

When Rihanna went on Good MorningAmer-
ica on November 5th to talk about her relation-
ship with Chris Brown and the infamous night
he beat her, televisions across America were
filled with messages to teenage girls about pro-
tecting themselves. But these messages lacked
important questions like, "What if it's the girl-
friend who's abusive?" or "What if someone
isn't in a heterosexual relationship? What about
that kind of abuse?" It is from the lack of these
kinds of questions that the idea for our Women's
Studies Activism Project was born. We wanted
to investigate sexual violence on our campus -
including rape, sexual assault, verbal and physi-
cal abuse and sexual harassment.
We initially sought to critique the inclusive-
ness of resources on campus, but we discovered
that - contrary to our expectations - many of
the resources are actively seeking to be inclu-
sive of all kinds of sexual violence: men against
women, men against men, queer, straight, trans,
etc. While investigating campus resources, we
interviewed two campus organizations, Coun-
seling and Psychological Services and Sexual
Assault Prevention and Awareness Center,
both of which we felt dealt directly with sexual
violence and its consequences. We found that
both use gender neutral language when talk-
ing to victims and that their staff members are
trained to handle violence in same-sex partner-
ships and heterosexual couples. Our University
is not lacking in resources for victims of sexual
violence outside the perceived "norm." Rather it
is we, the students, who need to be more open-
minded when discussing this sensitive topic.
After discovering this, we sought to under-
stand why the resources on campus were so
different from our expectations. Drawing on
our personal experiences as individuals in vari-

ous student organizations, social groups and
classes, we realized that although the institu-
tional resources are adopting a more inclusive
view of sexual violence, the conversations we
have in our day-to-day lives reinforce norma-
tive narratives about sexuality and gender. As
a campus, we need to engage in conversations
about non-normative sexual violence. By ignor-
ing the fact that sexual violence occurs in queer
relationships or at the hands of a girl againsther
boyfriend, we are assuming that our campus is
made up of pairings in which the man always
possesses physical dominance over his female
significant other. Assumptions like these fuel a
sexist culture.
While we were happy to learn that our cam-
pus resources can accommodate and help sur-
vivors of sexual violence regardless of sexual
orientation and gender, we were saddened to
realize just how little attention these issues
receive in our daily lives. The University is
a diverse place and it is up to the students to
make sure that conversations, especially those
about something as sensitive as sexual violence,
include all identities and people.
If you or someone you know is the victim of
sexual violence, there are many resources on
campus. The SAPAC website has a comprehen-
sive list of many resources on campus, locally,
statewide and nationally: http://www.umich.
edu/-sapac/.
Additionally, the Rape, Abuse & Incest
National Network Crisis Hotline is available:

he ABS light clicked on and
no more than five minutes
later, my brother's car broke
down in the Bronx
right before the
George Wash-
ington Bridge on
Thanksgiving
eve. Although he
had to wait three
hours for AAA,
pee on the side of
the road and fend
off a man with LEAH
an aluminum bat POTKIN
(yes, this is all
true), he was for-
tunate enough
to be with his college roommate
and only a short distance from our
extended family. So, while my moth-
er sat anxiously between calls to my
brother, his roommate and AAA, I
couldn't help but smile and laugh
about the whole situation. And that
led me to this conclusion: everyone
should watch the Thanksgiving epi-
sodes of "Friends."
Thanksgiving inevitably brings
with it some sort of grand-scale
calamity, whether it be altered travel
plans, insufferable in-laws or burnt
turkeys. After all, whose families
haven't sparred over which relatives
to visit or invite over? But what if we
didn't view any of this obligatory trav-
el and forced family time as potential-
ly disastrous, but rather as comical?
Here's where the million dollar-per-
episode cast of "Friends" have some-
thing on all of us - and we should
learn from their (though admittedly
contrived) remarkable ability to make
light of any situation.
To state the obvious, there are few
comedies in history that rival this
10-year-phenomenon in universal
appeal. I laughed at Joey when I was
10 and understood more ofChandler's
jokes at 19. But why the Thanksgiving

episodes? From cameos by Brad Pitt
to a turkey stuck on Joey's head, the
absurdity of these tension- and disas-
ter-filled episodes, with the addition
of an audience laugh track, manage to
lighten the mood and help us appre-
ciate the commonality of our own
experiences.
In honor of David Schwimmer's
presence on campus (he's directing
a new movie called "Trust"), I picked
a few of my favorite Thanksgiving
episodes as examples. The situa-
tions may be fictional, butI would bet
nearly everyone can see a bit of their
lives through this classic 30-minute
comedy - and learn something from
it, too.
"The One With The Football" epi-
sode revolves around the cherished
Geller Cup, a trophy awarded to the
winner of a Thanksgiving football
rivalry of the Geller family. With
Ross and Monica pitted against each
other, needless to say, the competi-
tion is fierce. But instead of crying
(this is always my main tactic), pos-
turing and complaining, the Gellers
duke it out in what I find one of the
most entertaining sports games
I've ever viewed (sorry Wolverines,
"Friends" outdid you).
Another favorite, "The One With
All The Thanksgivings," shows flash-
backs of past Thanksgiving disas-
ters and manages to make light of
all of them. Most notable is the one
where Monica unintentionally drops
a knife, severing Chandler's toe. In
my household, this type of disaster
would be synonymous with tears
and chaos, rather than laughter and
amusement as is the case with the
"Friends." Even years later as they
reminisce, they still manage to laugh
about it.
Yes, maybe if you drop a knife on
someone's toe it won'tend in marriage,
but there certainly are lessons to learn
from similar misfortunes of life. My

brother's broken-down car provides a
perfect example. After waiting in the
Bronx, my brother ultimately had to
sleep at myuncle's house in New York,
which enabled him to spend time
with family he wouldn't have other-
wise seen. We should appreciate these
types of situations because the time
my brother got to spend with family
is truly something to be thankful for,
and is more important than the time
he could have spent stressing over his
poor luck..,
"Friends" showed
me the value of a
sense of humor.

And even more importantly,
watching these episodes reinforces
my own personal goal to lighten
up. Many of us are consumed with
stress over what we perceive as cri-
ses, whether it be stressing over
tests, relationships, the current
economic situation or prospects for
employment. But why not adopt this
"Friends"-inspired attitude and,
despite luckless situations, smile and
laugh at our own problems?
Because we unfortunately can no
longer rely on the Central Perk gang
to relieve our pre- or post-holiday
stress, we need to take matters into
. our own hands. Without the help
of NBC this Thanksgiving, I took it
upon myself to smile at my brother's
bad luck, just as the cast laughed
about Chandler's severed toe. And
as a result, I will fondly remember
this past Thanksgiving as "The One
Where The Car Broke Down."

"The Two Couple Play and Other Short Works" requires many students to play multiple roles in one evening.

A 'Couple' of laughs

I Stoma Centet
though opening Free
night was 24
hours off, the
atmosphere pervading the dress
rehearsal for Basement Arts' lat-
est production, "The Two Couple
Play and Other Short Works," was
more than promising.
From the professionalism of

the directors to the dedication of
the actors, it's natural to assume
the show has been in rehearsal
for a while or it's under the direc-
tion of an experienced faculty
member. In actuality, rehearsals
have been in progress for only
three weeks, and the cast and
crew of the project is composed
of students with a varying ranges
of theater experience.
"The Two Couple Play and
Other Short Works" consists
of three one-act plays written,
produced, directed and acted by
students. Though the three sepa-
rate works bear similar styles of
humor, aesthetic and theme, the
variety of characters and sto-
ries should appeal to a large and
diverse audience. The title piece,
"The Two Couple Play," has suc-
ceeded in relating particularly to
college-aged audiences.
"I've been hearing a lot of real-
ly positive feedback I didn't really

expect from 'The Two Couple
Play,' which is.. about what it is
like to be in your 2Os in 2010,"
said LSA senior Zach Smilovitz,
writer of all three plays and first-
time director of one. (Smilovitz
also serves as the Daily's political
satire columnist.)
"It's very difficult ... It feels
like a lot of theater today is not
about what our age group is going
through," he said.
This production has allowed
those involved to explore and
experiment with multiple facets
of putting on a show. With actors
taking very different roles in mul-
tiple plays, directors acting as pro-
ducers and writers trying their
hands at directing, this produc-.
tion has been a learning experi-
ence for the entire cast and crewi
"I'm in the acting program. I'm
also a film director even though
I haven't directed a play since
my freshman year here. It's been
four years since I've directed a
play," Liam White, Music, The-
atre & Dance and LSA senior said.
White is also the show's producer
and director of one of the plays.
Naturally, these crossovers

lead to some complications. Nico
Anger, Music, Theatre & Ounce
senior and lead actor in two of the
plays, says that instantaneously
switching roles between an old
Jewish man and a young aspiring
20-something has been his big-
gest challenge.
"I literally go off stage and come
back on 10 seconds later and have
to do the next thing," Anger said.
"It's difficult jumping from
one rehearsal to another with
all of the lines ... and having to
keep them all straight. A lot of
the times I start saying lines
from other plays or I mix it up
and start going into the Jewish
accent while I'm in the car. It
gets confusing."
Though producing three very
different showsiin, huih a Ishort'
amount of time presents some
obvious challenges, the dedication
and talent of everyone involved
will be visible come show time.
"The Two Couple Play and Other
Short Works" will be performed
tonight at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. and
tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Studio One
at the Walgreen Drama Center.
Admission is free.

The war in Iraq's human Grim Reapers

By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
There's something absurdly alienating,
and maybe even dehumanizing, about hav-
ing to break the news of
someone's death to people
you don't know. The ordeal
forces you to boil down the
complexities of human grief
to a simple science that can Messenger
be understood and manipu- At the
lated. But in "The Messen- .i
ger," the new Iraq war-era Michigan
drama by director and c O Losope
writer Oren Moverman (who
previously co-scripted "I'm
Not There"), that science of grief is played for
pathos instead of cold disconnection.
Ultimately, when the product being shipped
is sadness, it hurts a lot to be the delivery boy.
Ben Foster ("Pandorum") gives a deeply
touching breakthrough performance as Will
Montgomery, a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army
who is sent home after injuring himself in
battle and is reassigned to his local "Angel
of Death" squadron. When a soldier dies, it
becomes his job to break the news to the next
of kin, or NOK, as they're coldly called. There
must always be two soldiers present to deliver
the death notice, and Montgomery's partner is
Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson, "Zom-
bieland"), a grizzled veteran of carrying these
Grim Reaper-like tidings.
Tony talks about their job as though it's a
military operation akin to Desert Storm, and
he brings certain rules to their line of work:
Speak only with the NOK. Don't greet them
with a "good morning" - "Ain't nothing good
about it," Tony remarks. And under no circum-
stances are you to touch the NOK. No extended
compassion beyond the government-regulated
amount is allowed.
"The Messenger" isn't really an "Iraq war
movie." It's a film about being in the pres-
ence of death and an exploration of the vari-
ous forms grief can take. Far from making an
overtly political statement, the movie succeeds
because it's a deeply human drama with touch-
ing performances, including Steve Buscemi
("Fargo") in the most heartbreaking three-
minute role you'll ever see.
Foster and Harrelson both play tortured

souls whose spirits were broken long before
they became Angels of Death. Foster is par-
ticularly devastating. The young actor is in
every scene, and his stoic silences speak vol-
umes about the intense pain that's hiding just
under his skin. He begins a tentative and ethi-

cally questionable relationship with a newly
widowed recipient of his message (Saman-
tha Morton, "Synecdoche, New York"). This
story could have gone into territory too grim
for even this film, but the two actors are so
delicate with each others' emotions that their
scenes together are some of the most effective
in the movie.
In his first directing job, Moverman proves
himself as an ace at navigating the whole spec-

trum of human emotion through superb cam-
erawork that never shifts its focus away from
the drama. He knows when to use extended
single takes for blistering emotional effec-
tiveness, and keeps a morbidly aware tone
throughout. A homecoming scene where a
returning soldier mocks-the song "Taps" is fol-
lowed immediately by the funeral of a different
soldier, where, yes, "Taps" is played. No need to
dance around the subject of death like a more
cautious filmmaker might have done: Here the
subject's always right there in the open, invad-
ing every frame, the true star of the film.
There's no hope in "The Messenger" in the
traditionally melodramatic sense, but ulti-
mately an uplifting spirit does prevail in the
characters that has nothing to do with the hor-
rors of war. Here is a film that is deeply rev-
erent to and understanding of our military.
The fact that it was made by a veteran of the
Israeli Defense Forces, not the U.S. Armed
Forces, is demonstrative of the universality of
the themes on display here. There is death in
war, just as there is death in life, and films like
"The Messenger" can help us to live and learn
alongside its presence.

PARTY POLICY
From Page 1
it difficult for its members to par-
ticipate in risk management at IFC-
registered parties. For example, the
sorority can't co-sponsor events at
fraternities if they have alcohol.
Though the national organi-
zation prohibits the University's
chapter of Alpha Phi from co-
sponsoring a party - making it as
liable as the fraternity it's working
with - Kahangi wrote in an e-mail
that allowing members to take on a
more active risk management role
isn't out of the question.
"Alpha Phi is open to working
with its collegiate chapters to grant
waivers to some policy specifics
when a comprehensive plan is cre-
ated that addresses all risks and
ensures the collegiate women are
safe," she wrote in an e-mail inter-
view.
Panhel Vice President of Public
Relations Stephanie Lazarus said
the specific role of the women at
these functions has yet to be deter-
mined, but right now Panhel is
focusing on creating the task force
and getting chapters involved.
"We were worried that people
might be hesitant but the chap-
ters in general are very excited to
become more active," she said.
Lazarus said the role of women
at the parties would be viewed
more as a "helping hand" to frater-
nity members and they will not be
taking on the formal role of sober
monitor, leaving them less liable.
"A term we've been using lately
is that the they would be a liaison
between the men and the women,"
she said.
Lazarus added that having
women involved in risk manage-
ment will help make sure the rules
are followed at the party and bring
comfort during the "God-forbid-
this-happens" moments.
"If something bad happens, the
girls might feel more comfortable
interacting with a woman from
their own chapter instead of a fra-
ternity member they may not know,

regardless of how nice they may
be," she said.
Though placing women in risk
management roles would help par-
tygoers respond to any incident,
Lazarus said the creation of the task
force isn't in response to an increase
in incidents. Instead, it's a goal that
the current executive board wants
to implement before it leaves.
The task force will begin work-
ing at the start of the winter
semester. The members of the
group will work on a final proposal
that will be voted on at the end of
the semester. The proposed plan
will then be implemented in the
upcoming fall term.
"Essentially, the role of the Task
Force is to aid the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation and Interfraternity Council
Executive Boards in making future
decisions about the social climate of
Greek Life here at the University of
Michigan," the proposal for the task
force states. "Currently, conflicting
national policies exist so together,
we, as a community, would like to
formulate a plan of action that will
effectively work for all members."
Lazarus said the process is going
to be "alot of trial and error." -
"There's no one (policy) that I'm
aware of that all the chapters have
in common," she said. "It's going
to be a lot of investigating into the
policies and a lot of discussion and
dialogue."
IFC President Ari Parritz said
he's very supportive of the policy
and is excited to work with Panhel
to implement it.
"The guys have 100 percent of
the responsibility and any measure
to more equally share, divide or
split the responsibility, we're more
than interested in that," he said.
"We have nothing to lose and we
only have to gain from this."
Lazarus said giving the women
more responsibility will not only
make the parties safer, but willben-
efit the women as well.
"The women really need to take
ownership and create something
they think works for them knowing
their policies for their individual
chapters," she said.

Senate keeps Medicare cuts in health bill

Senators also vote to
approve safeguards
for coverage of
mammograms
WASHINGTON (AP) - Cast-
ing its first votes on revamping the
nation's health care system, the
Senate rejected a Republican bid
Thursday to stave off Medicare cuts
and approved safeguards for cover-
age of mammograms and other
preventive tests for women. The
first round of votes ended with a
fragile Democratic coalition hang-
ing together.
Senators voted 58-42 to reject an
amendment by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., that would have stripped
more than $400 billion in Medicare
cuts from the nearly $1trillion mea-
sure. It would have sent the entire
2,074-page bill back to the Senate
Finance Committee for a redo.
Republicans said the proposed
cuts to health insurance plans
and medical providers mean
seniors in the popular Medicare
Advantage program will lose
benefits. And they predicted law-
makers will ultimately back away

from the cuts, once seniors start
feeling the brunt.
"Medicare is already in trouble.
The program needs to be fixed,
not raided to create another new
government program," said Repub-
lican leader Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky.
Democrats said seniors will not
lose any guaranteed benefits. The
cuts - amounting to a 2 percent
slowdown in spending - will help
keep Medicare solvent by making it
more efficient, they contended. And
theypointedoutthatthehealthcare
overhaul bill improves preventive
care and prescription coverage.
"My colleagues on the Republi-
can side have resorted to the poli-
tics of fear to preserve a broken
health care system," said Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa. "What we're hear-
ing are scare tactics designed to
mislead seniors."
AARP, the seniors' lobby, threw
its weight behind the Democrats.
The votes Thursday came after
three days of angry debate in which
Democrats accused Republicans of
stalling to try to kill the bill, and
Republicans protested that they
were only exercising their right to
give the complex legislation full
scrutiny.

PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS/AP
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., right, accompanied by Senate Minority leader Mitch
McConnell of Ky., left, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. speak to members of the
media on Capitol Hill in Washington, yesterday.

The first votes were held under
a special agreement requiring 60
votes to prevail. That tested the
coalition Democrats are count-
ing on to move President Barack
Obama's signature issue. The mar-
ginwas close on thewomen's health
amendment, which aims to safe-
guard coverage of mammograms
and preventive screeningtestunder
a revamped system.

The 61-39 vote on a provision
by Democrat Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland and Republican Olympia
Snowe of Maine was the first sub-
stantive ballot in an acrimonious
debate that promises to go on for
weeks.
After that will come an amend-
ment to restrict abortion funding,
except in cases of rape, incest or to
save the life of the mother.


MILANO
From Page 1
alcohol counseling.
John Shea, Milano's attorney,
grew noticeably agitated as he
responded to Barnett's request for
both incarceration and an extend-
ed probationary period, raising his
voice as he insisted that Milano
has shown remorse for the injuries
Kampfer sustained.
Shea reminded the court that
multiplewitnessesduringtrialpro-
ceedings said Kampfer was "abus-
ing" his former girlfriend. Shea
said Milano confronted Kampfer

only to stop him from hurting the
woman.
"No good deed goes unpun-
ished," Shea said. "I believe Mr.
Milano faces that now."
Shea said Milano had essentially
been on probation for the past 13
months -the time since the inci-
dent occurred - and that further
probation would be excessive.
Just before Judge David Swartz
made his decision, Milano said he
apologized to Kampfer by e-mail
within days of the incident, adding
that the injuries he caused were
unintentional.
"I absolutely never intended to
hurt Steven Kampfer," Milano said.

"My only intent was to protect a
girl who he was coming to harm ...
and protect myself."
'Before announcingMilano's sen-
tence, Swartz said he agreed with
Shea that Milano had no intention
of causing Kampfer harm and had
since shown remorse for the inju-
ries Kampfer sustained.
Swartz cited a statement read
by a probationary counselor who
interviewed Milano concerning
the incident, who said the inju-
ries Milano inflicted "were not
vicious, predatory or intentional in
nature."
In a phone interview with The
Michigan Daily after the trial,

Shea said while Milano is happy
to not face a more severe sentence,
the conviction itself still does not
sit well with him.
"Mr.Milano continues to believe
he should not have been convicted,
but the jury disagreed," Shea said.
"But all things considered, we are
very happy with the outcome."
Swartz has stated before that he
believes Milano to be innocent of
all charges.
Immediately following the close
of the jury conviction on Oct. 22,
Swartz recommended that Milano
file an order to have the conviction
expunged in five years, which he
said he would be happy to sign.

The two suspects are thought

to be homeless, Jatczak said.
"I don't know where they stay,
but we don't have a house address
for them," he said.
Neither suspect has commit-
ted an arson-related crime before,
Jatczak said, although he was
unsure of their overall criminal
histories.

MONROE STREET
From Page 1
Kosteva said he believes the
mall, ifconstructed, wouldstrong-
ly benefit the University. ,
"It would help create another
unique campus place and it would

support a strong connection
between the existing law school
facilities and the new South Hall
addition," Kosteva said.
Many law students also said
they believe a pedestrian mall
would have a positive impact.
Third-year Law student Jake
Weixler said he thinks the pedes-

trian mall could improve student
safety.
"It might provide a safe passage
between (the Law Quad) and the
new building," Weixler said.
Second-year Law student
Emily Haigh said that like the
benches added to the Law Quad,
the University.could benefit from

the aesthetic value of a pedes-
trian mall.
Although it has been a long
process so far, Kosteva said he
remains optimistic.
"We're hopeful that we can get
in front of the Planning Commis-
sion sometime within the next
three months," he said.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com


Graham named team MVP

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN and
RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editors
LIVONIA - The introduction
said it all.
"This kid is what Michigan foot-
ball is all about," Master of Ceremo-
nies Derrick Walker proclaimed.
Andthe crowdgathered inLaurel
Manor for the 89th annual football
bust erupted.
Senior defensive end Brandon
Graham, Michigan's first defensive
player to be voted team MVP twice,
received nearly a minute-long
standing ovation, by far the longest
of the night.
Graham stood proudly at the
podium, flashinghis lovable smile to
the crowd as he fought back tears.
"Isaid I wasn'tgoingto cry, buty'all
tempting me,"he said with a laugh.
The last two-time team MVP was
running back Mike Hart in 2006
and 2007. The only other players to
earn that honor were wide receiver
Anthony Carter, running backs Ron
Johnson and Tom Harmon and
guard Ralph Heikkinen.
Graham, the nation's leader in
tackles for loss, recited his page-
and-a-half thank-you speech before
embracing Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez and receiving his 'M'

ring. I
"I spent two days (working on
it)," Graham said. "I just wanted to
memorize it more than anything."
But Graham wasn't the only one
who received a prolonged standing
ovation. Rodriguez took the podium
with a very supportive crowd, one
that was certainly encouraged by
his sense ofhumor.
"I want to set the record straight
since our last ball game, walking
off that field, there's been a lot of
rumors and speculation about my
future," Rodriguez said. "I'm here
to set the record straight. I am not
a candidate for the University of
Notre Dame position."
Rodriguez added a few more
laughs before turning serious as
he addressed the crowd for over 15
minutes. The second-year coach
thoughtthere were more life lessons
this season than in any of the other
25 he has coached.
But Rodriguez didn't stay serious
for long, closing on an enthusiastic
note.
"We're going to have these busts
celebrating Big Ten championships
and Rose Bowl victories and com-
petingfor anational championship,"
Rodriguez said in closing, prompt-
ing another standing ovation.
WARREN NOT WAVERING:

Donovan Warren sat calmly, don-
ning a bright pink tie as he listened
to his senior leaders give their sen-
doff speeches. But if the junior cor-
nerback has his way, he might not be
giving a speech at nextyear's bust.
Warren told several media out-
lets he is strongly considering leav-
ing early for the NFL.
"I'm definitely, I'd have to say
heavily, I like the chances of me
coming out," Warren told the
Detroit Free Press.
The Long Beach, Calif. native
recently applied to the NFL Adviso-
ry Committee, a service that evalu-
ates early-entry candidates.
Players usually receive feedback
from the advisory committee in a few
weeks about their possible draft posi-
tion. Warren said he planned to make
his decision in the coming weeks.
According to ESPN.com's NFL
DraftTracker, Warren is listed as the
No. 4 cornerback and the 42nd-best
prospect, making him a potential
second-round pick. Rodriguez said
he spoke with Warien earlier Thurs-
day and encouraged him to make an
educated decision with his family.
"Ifa guy's a first rounder and he
has that kind of opportunity, you
certainly understand that," Rodri-
guez said. "Beyond being a first
rounder or a high second-round

pick, I think they're always better
served finishing their degree and
playing their fourth year."
Graham, who never applied to
the NFL advisory committee, said
he would give Warren advice on his
decision to go pro.
"If you're going to leave, then be
on that board," Graham said. "If
you're not, just don't answer the
phone. That's what I did. I already
knew I was staying."
Warren tallied four interceptions
and six pass breakups this season
despite battling what Rodriguez
called some "tough ankle pain"
stemming from ligament issues.
SMITH TEARS ACL: Freshman tail-
back Vincent Smith tore his ACL
against Ohio State and will undergo
surgery, Rodriguez said yesterday.
Smith will miss spring practice.

Buckeyes' overall rate of 73 per-
cent is the fifth-worst penalty kill
in Division I hockey.
Both Caporusso and junior for-
ward Carl Hagelin downplayed
the statistic and said that they
were just concerned about the
Wolverines' play. It certainly has
improved as of late.
"We're starting to pick it up on
the power play right now," Hage-
lin said. "We're moving the puck
pretty well.... We're on a roll."
The Wolverines sport the third-
best penalty-kill rate in Division I,
and the unit has been the team's
strength throughout the season.
And one reason the extra-man
attack has improved is its compe-
tition in practice.
"Our penalty killers are really
frustrating to work against (in
practice) because' they're good,"
Berenson said. "It helps and it
hurts.
"It helps us to know that if we
can beat these guys or make a good
play against them, then we have a
chance to do that in the game. But
it hurts (because) we can't beat
them."

Michigan has been getting bet-
ter touches on the puck, estab-
lishing longer possession in the
offensive zone, and improving its
passing on the power play. Beren-
son also sees the Wolverines mov-
ing the puck quicker, which creates
more scoring opportunities.

the power play, and the puck is

complacency, but Michigan knows
now is not the time to rest.
"We've got to keep this winning
streak alive," Caporusso said. "We
didn't get off to the greatest start.
We don't have that cushion like we
normally do to be able to give up
wins that we deserve.
"That's going to be the type of
hockey we're going to have to play

to have to get the wins."
