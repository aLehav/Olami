A2 Dems host debate for City Council candidates

50 years later: A look at July 1967 in the city of Detroit

Topics of housing, 

downtown development 
dominate conversation

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

Seven candidates and more than 30 Ann 

Arbor residents attended a forum of City 
Council candidates hosted by the Ann 
Arbor Democratic Party Monday night. 

All the candidates who were present will 
be competing in the Democratic primary 
on August 8.

The candidates present were Anne Ban-

nister from Ward 1, Stephen Kunselman 
and incumbent Zachary Ackerman from 
Ward 3, Jaime Magiera and incumbent 
Jack Eaton in Ward 4 and David Silkworth 
and incumbent Chip Smith from Ward 5. 
Jason Frenzel, the Ward 1 City Council 
member whose seat is being challenged 
by Bannister, did not attend. Because 
Democrat Jared Hoffert from Ward 2 is 

contesting independent Councilmember 
Jane Lumm’s seat and has no Democrat-
ic opponent, he did not participate aside 
from providing opening remarks.

The topics of housing, development and 

climate action dominated the discussion, 
with much of the conversation focus-
ing around the controversial sale of the 
“Library Lot” across from the downtown 
district library on Fifth Avenue to the 
Chicago-based development firm Core 
Spaces. A petition to put the sale of the lot 
on the ballot in November received 5,779 

signatures but fell a few hundred short 
of success. A city-wide survey in 2013 
showed that 76.2 percent of respondents 
thought Ann Arbor would benefit from 
more downtown open spaces, and 41.5 
percent of respondents chose the Library 
Lot as the best place to build such a space.

Additionally, the sale has raised legal 

questions regarding the tax-exempt status 
of the bonds used to fund construction of 
the surface and underground parking lots 
the Library Lot currently occupies. The 
issue has become so divisive that Ban-

Detroiters, University 

faculty reflect on a pivotal 

point in history

Erin McBrien remembers Detroit as quiet 

for most of the summer of 1967. Her father’s 
position as a police officer required the family 

live within the city’s confines.

“We were not in the thick of things,” 

McBrien said. “We were on the outside edges. 
Of course, we didn’t go down in that area … 
We were kids. It was quiet in our neighbor-
hood.”

But one week, while her father worked 

day-long shifts, the rest of the family would 
spend the hot July days in Grosse Pointe with 
friends at local parks. But they knew that the 
streets weren’t as quiet as they once had been.

“We would walk up to Mack and there 

were National Guard with rifles up on the top 
of buildings right at the corner of Detroit and 
Grosse Pointe,” McBrien recalled.

McBrien said aside from her father, her 

family did not go near 12th and Clairmount 
streets during the week of July 23, and as a 
nine year old, she didn’t watch much news 
coverage either.

“We 
knew 
something 
was 
wrong,” 

McBrien said. “I don’t think we understood 
the severity of it.”

When her father came home for a break 

from work, he slept downstairs, McBrien said, 
with his gun within an arm’s reach and the 
hose — in case of a fire nearby — just outside 
the door.

The beginning
Meanwhile, July of 1967 in Ann Arbor, at 

the University of Michigan, was like any other 
— students took summer semester classes, 
enjoyed walks in the Diag in warm sunshine 
and socialized at coffee shops or popular 
establishments.

“Gameful” learning 
applies video games’ 

design to online 
teaching systems

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

Day Two of the Gameful Course 

Design Summer Institute took 
place Tuesday. Hosted by Academ-
ic Innovation’s Gameful Learning 
Lab, the two-day event took place 
in the Michigan Union Kuenzel 
Room and saw approximately 40 
attendees — primarily instructors 
and graduate student instructors 
from the University of Michigan, K 
through 12 teachers, instructional 
designers and higher education fac-
ulty from across the country. The 
event aimed to teach participants 
about gameful learning opportuni-
ties and how they can implement 
such practices in their classes.

The Gameful Learning Lab 

encourages educators to imple-
ment new learning environments 
in their courses. Gameful learn-
ing refers to a type of learning — a 

pedagogy or approach to course 
design — that draws on the designs 
and techniques of video games and 
applies their attributes to online 
teaching systems.

In 2012, GradeCraft — a learning 

management system that encour-
ages gameful learning, created by 
Barry Fishman, Arthur F. Thurnau 
Professor of Learning Technolo-
gies in the School of Information 
and School of Education and Rack-
ham student Caitlin Holman — 
launched its first course at the 
University.

In fall 2015, GradeCraft merged 

with the Digital Innovation Green-
house, a program also overseen by 
Academic Innovation, which aims 
to explore methods of digital learn-
ing. By the summer of 2016, over 
5,100 students had taken a game-
ful course at one of five institutions 
nationally and the Gameful Learn-
ing Lab opened in fall 2016.

Rachel Niemer, the founding 

director of the Gameful Learning 
Lab, said the purpose of the lab is 
to explore gameful learning oppor-
tunities.

“Over time, we’ve built a larger 

community of instructors that 
have been experimenting both 

with gameful course design, but 
also other pedagogies that try to 
tap into students’ intrinsic moti-
vations,” she said. “We’re really 
looking at how (you can) design 
learning experiences differently to 
be more engaging — not necessar-
ily more fun … — but really focus 
on what draws people in to do the 
hard work of learning.” 

Niemer said the purpose of the 

event is to spread the University’s 
work in gameful learning to the 
larger community.

Today, approximately 34 Uni-

versity instructors have used Gra-
deCraft for their courses, according 
to Niemer, and several others have 
incorporated gameful principles 
in their teaching. Opportunities 
within gameful learning include 
multiple “pathways,” in which 
students can make their own deci-
sions about what learning activities 
would be most beneficial for them, 
as well as students earning points 
from zero to get their desired 
grade, among several others.

“One of the ways I talk about 

(gameful learning) is that it’s a cre-
ative playspace for instructors to 
think differently about their teach-
ing,” she said.

Niemer said, oftentimes, when 

people talk about educational 
technology, they use a lot of buzz-
words, such as personalized learn-
ing, adaptive learning and teaching 
at scale; she said people are con-
cerned with the practical impli-
cations of how technology can be 
used for teaching. On the flip side, 
she said, there’s a scholarly disci-
pline focusing on critical digital 
pedagogies that study educational 

technology from a more theoretical 
and intellectual perspective.

“What gameful (learning) is 

trying to do is actually connect the 
scholarly to the practical, and the 
practical back to the scholarly,” she 
said.

Niemer said the University is in 

a unique position to contemplate 
the scholarly-practical dichotomy 
because it has been doing so on 
campus in a sort of “distributed 
network” on campus. Niemer said 
she hopes that by bringing people 
from outside the University to 
campus to hear about the work the 
University has done so far in the 
field, the gameful phenomenon will 
spread.

Tuesday kicked off with a panel 

discussion moderated by Niemer 
and featured four University affili-
ates to discuss their experiences 
with gameful learning. Among 
the panelists was Mika LaVaque-
Manty, a Presidential Bicentennial 
professor, an Arthur F. Thurnau 
professor and an associate profes-
sor of political science, who also 
served as an investigator on a grant 
that has funded development on 
GradeCraft.

LaVaque-Manty taught his first 

gameful learning class in 2009: 
Political Science 101, which has 250 
to 300 students. He said students 
came into the class thinking there 
would be discussion of healthcare 
and elections, when in fact — to their 
surprise — it examined thinkers like 
Thomas Hobbes and Machiavelli.

As Republicans 

“stray” from platform, 

Colbeck runs on 

promise of “principled 

solutions”

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

On Saturday afternoon, over 200 

Michigan residents gathered out-
side the Yankee Air Museum in Bel-
leville to support State Sen. Patrick 
Colbeck (R) at his official campaign-
launch for the 2018 gubernatorial 
race.

Colbeck graduated from the Uni-

versity of Michigan with a degree in 
Aerospace Engineering in 1987; he 
received his masters degree from 
the University in 1988. He gradu-
ated from the Life Sciences Depart-
ment of the International Space 
University in France and worked on 
systems for the International Space 
Station. In 2010, Colbeck entered 
the Michigan Senate, representing 
the state’s 7th district. He filed the 
paperwork to run for governor on 

May 31.

Over 50 volunteers helped orga-

nize and execute the event. Central 
to their agenda was an effort to get 
signatures; candidates need 15,000 
signatures in order to get their name 
on the ballot for the 2018 election.

AnneMarie Schieber Dykstra, 

the communications director for 
Colbeck’s campaign, noted Col-
beck’s pitch is to stick to a set of 
principles.

“Republicans have a set platform 

and there’s been a lot of criticism 
that they’ve strayed from that,” she 
said. “Once they get into office, they 
end up serving the interest of the 
powerful few and that’s not what 
he’s about.”

Running on a platform of “prin-

cipled solutions,” Colbeck puts 
forth guiding principles to solve 
the problems facing the state. 
Central to his platform are efforts 
to build better roads, provide 
cheaper health plans with bet-
ter quality care and hold the state 
government accountable for its use 
of money.

Additionally, Dykstra said Col-

beck wants “government to work 
for the people.” She said oftentimes 
politicians who enter office put 

forth corporate welfare programs 
to create jobs, such as the Good Jobs 
For Michigan, which gave big com-
panies an opportunity to capture 
income taxes from residents.

In his address, Colbeck high-

lighted his years prior to his work 
in politics. He said as an engineer, 
he never discussed politics.

“The first 44 years of my life, 

(my family and I) were sitting on 
the sidelines assuming that the 
people we elected to serve us, in 

office, were serving our best inter-
est, not their own self-interest,” 
he said. “While there are some 
very, very notable exceptions, I’m 
finding that all too often that that 
type of service is the exception, 
not the rule. That’s what we need 
to turn around in our state … This 
is time for some principled ser-
vice.”

Republican State Senator Patrick Colbeck 
holds launch for gubernatorial campaign

nister said it was the single issue 
that encouraged her to run.

“Running 
for 
council 
was 

not something that was on my 
radar until about three months 
ago, when City Council voted 
to sell the public Library Lot 
to Chicago developers to build 
the 17-story tall building and 
lease the majority of the parking 
places for 50 years,” she said. “I 
would not have supported this 
project, because I believe council 
must listen to the many voices of 
residents and local business who 
have actively been opposing this 
project.”

A primary motivation City 

Council members have cited 
for selling the lot has been the 
creation of affordable housing, 
though it is not yet certain how 
much of the Core Spaces develop-
ment will be designated for that 
purpose. In an interview earlier 
this month, Frenzel defended his 

vote to sell the lot, saying that 
housing price pressures were 
driving people out of the city.

“The thing that’s lost in that 

conversation, though, that’s real-
ly important to me, is not only are 
we looking at changing the way 
the city looks, but we are also 
substantively changing the peo-
ple that can live here,” he said. 
“When housing costs go up, dis-
proportionately certain groups 
of people can no longer afford 
to be in our town: young profes-
sionals, older people and many 
times people of color. Allowing 
those housing pressures to push 
people out of our community is 
completely inappropriate in my 
book.”

Kunselman 
rejected 
that 

notion, however, saying Ann 
Arbor’s status as a university 
town meant getting developers 
to create affordable housing was 
not a realistic goal.

“When 
it 
comes 
to 
Ann 

Arbor gentrification, we have to 
remember that we are a global 
city. There’s a number of stu-

dents that come from around the 
world that will pay top dollar to 
live in Ann Arbor while they go 
to the University (of Michigan),” 
he said. “We are a company town, 
and the idea that we’re going to 
be able to build our way out by 
just having more housing and 
bigger buildings is a mistake. It’s 
not going to happen that way.”

Responding 
to 
Kunselman, 

though, Ackerman pointed out 
that as a council member, there 
were actions he could take 
toward the end of affordable 
housing.

“Talking about trying to influ-

ence developers in a positive 
direction is not a scare tactic,” 
he said. “We actually have a fair 
amount of control, and it’s called 
zoning policy. We dictate what 
can be built where, what it’s 
gonna look like and how it can be 
used.”

Saying he would have voted 

against the sale of the Library 
Lot, Silkworth said he thought 
zoning decisions should be put 
on the ballot.

“I would like to see our down-

town zoning be something our 
residents actually have a voice 
in deciding,” he said. “This is 
something that affects every 
single one of us. So I think we 
should put it on the ballot, so our 
residents are actually allowed to 
vote and decide what our zoning 
should be, what the long-term 
planning of our city will take. I 
don’t believe what we’re doing 
right now is what a lot of folks 
want.”

But his opponent, Chip Smith, 

said in the almost 20 years he’s 
worked as an urban planner, 
he has never seen a community 
that put their zoning out for 
public vote, as it would “make it 
impossible” to make changes and 
increase development.

On climate change, Magiera 

said he spent his life living out 
his values, minimizing his car-
bon emissions wherever possible.

from State Street in Ann Arbor to 
12th Street, now known as Rosa 
Parks Boulevard, in downtown 
Detroit — a riot was taking place: the 
culmination of years of racial tension 
and inequalities.

Under the rule of then-Mayor 

Jerome Cavanagh and a primar-
ily white police force, the city was 
plagued with segregation catalyzed 
by tensions among different groups 
in the city.

These tensions came to a head 

that Sun. July 23, when looting and 
flames diffused throughout the 12th 
and Clairmount area — in less than 
a week, 43 people died, 1,189 were 
injured and more than 7,200 were 
arrested as fires ravaged over 2,000 
buildings. Residents throughout the 
city felt fear.

This was a pivotal point in 

Detroit’s history — a city without 
which the University, established 
there 200 years ago, would not exist.

Background
A police raid at an underground 

bar, known in that time as a blind 
pig, served as the catalyst for the 
riots, the spark that lit the fuse of 
civil unrest.

Looting spread out from the 

epicenter of the bar after officers 
arrested about 80 people there in the 
early morning hours — Black resi-
dents said to have been celebrating 
the return of Vietnam War veterans. 
This quickly escalated throughout 
nearby streets, creating panic.

Tues. July 25, 1967 — halfway 

through the five-day period of con-
tention — the Daily published photos 
under the headline “Detroit: In the 
Middle of an Inferno.”

Splashed across the page are 

images of police patting down resi-
dents as business owners assess 
the damage of the previous days 
of violence and fires blaze strong-
ly behind troopers holding their 
weapons. The situation in Detroit 
was grim.

Relations between police and 

citizens strained. Controlling the 
mob that had aggregated over the 
preceding few days was impossible 
without reinforcements: supple-
menting the Detroit Police and Fire 
Departments were the Michigan 
State Police, the Wayne County 
Sheriff’s Department and the Mich-
igan Army National Guard, along 
with the 82nd and 101st Airborne 
Divisions.

Appreciate the small things
A 

few 
weeks 
ago, 
in 

preparation for a meeting 
with a client at work, I 

started fishing around my computer 
for a list of some slang words used 
in 
various 

Spanish-
speaking 
countries. 
I 

typed into my 
search window 
on my computer “slang,” thinking 
I’d find the document that way. But 
as my luck would have it, virtually 
everything containing the word 
“slang” in it came up, except for 
the document I was looking for, 
including text conversations I had no 
idea were archived.

Curious to see what would come up, 

and succumbing to my ever-shortening 
attention span (thanks, technology), 
I scrolled down to find an old portion 
of my application to the University of 
Washington. It was about slang. The 
prompt asked us to talk about a word 
we believe has lost its meaning. I chose 
to write about the word “awesome.”

I began like this: “Awesome is 

no longer reserved for what is awe-
inspiring or characterized by awe. 
Awesome is the discount we get for 
buying a six-pack of gum. Awesome 
is the chocolate cake dished out at a 
birthday party. Awesome is the fact 
that your local market is open on New 
Year’s Eve day. None of those things are 
magnificent, awe-inspiring, sublime, or 
the least bit majestic. I believe they do 
not deserve the word ‘awesome.’ ”

Though I still agree with my 17-year-

old self 
that calling a discount on a pack 

of gum “awesome” maybe does water 
down the meaning of the word, it got 
me thinking about appreciation. It 
made me think about how technology, 
in some ways, has caused us to forget 
to appreciate the small things. Forget 
that everywhere we look we are 
surrounded by amazing feats of the 
time period these technologies were 
created in. In a society where we’re 
always looking for the next new 
great thing, and progress means 
a newer this, a “smarter” that, a 
faster this, a shinier that, we lose 
sight of the wonderful things that 
are in our everyday lives.

Louis C.K. appeared on Conan 

O’Brien’s late show in 2015. In part 
of his segment, he commented how 
“everything is amazing yet nobody 
is happy.” He asked us to think, for a 
moment, about how far we’ve come 
with changes in society, and how at 
this moment, we may be better off 
going back to “simpler” times, because 
maybe we’d be more appreciative of 
what we have.

Sometimes, I just sit around and 

stare at things and think about how 
awesome and amazing it all is. (I 
promise I haven’t lost it.) Someone had 
to come up with an idea for something 
that is now so common, it’s seen as 
everyday, normal. But if you think 
about it, some of these everyday things 
are some of the most genius inventions.

Ziploc bags? Think about it. Yeah, it’s 

plastic and gets thrown away. (I am not 
a fan of that, though.) But someone sat 
down one day and thought, wouldn’t it 
be nice to be able to carry things around 
in a bag that won’t spill? Someone had 
to invent the Ziploc of the Ziploc bag.

I realize now that I probably sound 

a little insane — who sits around 
thinking about how amazing Ziploc 
bags are? But I truly believe that it’s 
time get back to work appreciating the 
small things in life. We are in an age 
where technology is rapidly changing. 
Where talk of self-driving cars, much 
to my dismay, are becoming a more 
regular topic of conversation.

And while I am certainly grateful 

for many technological advancements, 
new technology has become the focus 
of excitement. I would love to see 
the things we call were once hailed 
as phenomenal achievements, the 
so-called “little” things, everyday 
objects called “awesome.” As Louis 
C.K. said, we are often so quick to think 
that the “world owes us something,” 
because in an age where it only take 
seconds to send a text message, we have 
grown more impatient, more quick to 
complain when something takes much 
longer, or isn’t up “with the times.” 

You don’t have to be naive or 

simplistic, to appreciate so-called 
“small” things. I am the last person to 
look through rose-colored glasses. 
Unfortunately, I am sometimes 
very quick to think worst-case-
scenario. 
When 
something 

happens 
I 
can 
often 
spiral, 

“catastrophize,” as my mother 
says. So, when I say that I believe 
there is merit in appreciating 
what may seem like the smallest 
thing, I don’t say it lightly.

When I appreciate the small 

moments, appreciate the little 
things, the little revelations about 
life I have, it undoubtedly has 
made me happier in harder times. 
“Take time to stop and smell the 
roses” may be a relatively old and 
frequently-used saying, but right 
here and now, it’s as important to 
remember as ever.

old Michigan resident who 
works every morning as a

He fulfills his community service role

which is particularly insufficient for 
people with disabilities, who have 
different needs than able-bodied 
people. Nathan’s SSI check goes to 
more than just rent, utilities and 
transportation. Such miniscule 
compensations 
demonstrate 

federal 
ignorance: 
lawmakers 

must understand the costs of 
having a disability.

Moreover, SSI caps accumulated 

assets at $2,000, which means Nathan 
is prohibited from collecting more 
than a couple thousand dollars in 
savings. On the first of every month, the 
government checks his bank account, 
and if he is just one dollar over the limit, 
Nathan must forfeit whatever money 
he receives in SSI aid for that month. 
This condemns people with disabilities 
to poverty, making it difficult to work 

and allowing them less money to spend 
patronizing local businesses.

Unfortunately, 
other 
programs 

meant to alleviate this struggle 
aren’t much better. Social Security 
Disability 
Insurance 
offers 
more 

money, generally between $1,500 and 
$2,000 per month. But the problem 
with Disability Insurance is that 
many people who receive help are 
consequently barred from Medicaid 
assistance. This is because many 
states use the Federal Poverty 
Level as the cut-off in determining 
who qualifies for Medicaid, and it 
doesn’t take much for deserving people 
to be deemed ineligible.

On the topic of Medicaid: many 

Republican Party lawmakers are hell-
bent on slashing its budget. They cite 
concerns over inflating costs and a 
widening federal debt. But reducing the 
deficit doesn’t necessitate a restrictive 
restructuring of Medicaid; we should 
instead try to optimize existing welfare 
programs, Medicaid and beyond.

Republicans 
are 
correct 
that 

disability welfare urgently needs 
rethinking — SSI and SSDI fail to 
provide sufficient support for people 
with disabilities — but they’re moving 
in the wrong direction. Medicaid 
spending shouldn’t be left to the states, 
or worse, reduced. Instead, existing 
disability assistance programs should 
be revamped. Currently, SSI drives 
people with disabilities into poverty by 
capping assets. SSDI attempts to take 
them out of it, but in doing so it makes 
them ineligible for Medicaid. So those 
who receive SSI are out of luck, those 
who get SSDI lose Medicaid, and those 
who qualify for Medicaid are in danger 
of losing it at the hands of a GOP-
controlled Washington, D.C.

Thus, the solution for lawmakers 

is twofold: (1) Restructure broken 
programs like SSI and SSDI, and (2) 

prioritize Medicaid spending when 
repairing the Affordable Care Act.

Beyond restructuring, new laws 

can be passed that make it easier for 
people with disabilities to save money, 
too. If lawmakers need an example of 
excellent health-care legislation, they 
can look to the ABLE Act, authorized 
by Congress in 2014. ABLE accounts 
resemble 529 college plans in that they 
provide tax-free growth, while they 
also allow people with disabilities 
to contribute $100,000 in total. This 
is much more than is allowed by 
SSI. In addition, ABLE accounts are 
inexpensive to set up and facilitate 
independence, because the recipient 
can manage his or her own funds. 
Laws like the ABLE Act should 
not be isolated instances in which 
policymakers actually demonstrate 
an understanding of the dire ways 
people with disabilities currently 
get by in the United States.

Nathan Koski relies on an aide 

so that he can make it to on time 
to work, where he contributes to 
economic growth. He spent part of 
his SSI check on a computer so that 
he could sign up for his foods and 
nutrition class. He needs health care. 
He needs these programs to work 
to his benefit. Cutting Medicaid 
funding and maintaining flawed 
programs like SSI and SSDI would 
not help Americans with disabilities 
flourish. Such actions only push 
them into poverty, and the economy 
consequently suffers. Perhaps this 
is a cost of lowering health-care 
premiums and shrinking the deficit, 
as many lawmakers hope to do. If 
so, they need to ask themselves: is 
that cost really worth it?

L

ast year, I voted for Sen. Bernie 
Sanders in the Michigan 
primary. I was also one of 

the nearly 7 million small-dollar 
contributors that fueled the Bern. 
However, his actions in recent months 
have had me asking: what’s up with 
Bernie Sanders?

I 
supported 

Sanders because 
I liked that he 
ran without the 
backing of a billionaire-funded super 
PAC and his platform was rife with 
ideas and policies that I could get 
behind, like aggressively addressing 
climate change, making peace with 
Iran and Medicare for all.

I cast my vote for Sanders in the 

March primary and when he won 
Michigan (despite FiveThirtyEight 
putting the odds at around 99:1 for 
Clinton) I was justifiably excited. 
However, as it became clear that Hillary 
Clinton would be the Democratic 
nominee I accepted it, like any 
supporter of a losing candidate should 
and moved on to fully supporting her.

Then, after the Dems were utterly 

smashed in November 2016, in a time 
where the left needed unity and a 
coherent plan for the elections to come 
in 2018 and in 2020, Sen. Sanders began 
acting, well, strange.

First, 
Sanders 
repeatedly 

antagonized new DNC Chair Tom 
Perez — who bested Sanders pick in 
Rep. Keith Ellison for the role — during 
their joint “Come Together and Fight 
Back Tour” across several red and 
purple states. I can understand why he 
has not joined the Democratic Party, 
the leadership was not exactly fair to 
him in the primaries, but he should 
have at least honored the intentions 
of the tour instead of inflaming the 
troublesome divide among the left that 
he played a significant role in creating.

He has also endorsed and 

stumped for a string of candidates 
across the country, each of which 
has lost despite help from America’s 
most popular politician.

So all this has me scratching my 

head. If Bernie Sanders is going to try 
for the Democratic nomination and 
the presidency again then why is he not 
focused on helping Democrats win?

I concede that the 2018 midterms 

are 13 months away. However, Sen. 
Sanders has yet to indicate any 
interest in helping Democrats save 
the few that he finds ideologically pure. 
That needs to change.

Looking at his major endorsements 

since Ellison, a pattern emerges: the 
candidates he has endorsed were either 
running in deep red constituencies, 
such as Montana at large and Kansas’ 
4th Congressional District, or in areas 
where Clinton won handedly in the 
primaries, like Virginia and California.

It’s not hard to see what Sanders 

is 
trying 
to 
accomplish: 
He 

wants to prove that his brand of 
progressivism can win both in areas 
that went heavily for Trump and in 
traditional Democratic strongholds.

Meanwhile, 
there 
are 
critical, 

winnable elections that Sen. Sanders 
could actually make a significant 
impact in. Instead of going all in for 
Ben Jealous in Maryland (a reliably 
blue state that backed Clinton in 
the primaries), Sanders should turn 
his eye to Michigan, a state that he 
won in the primary but that Trump 
won (by a slim margin). Here he 
could play a pivotal role in retaining 
Democratic control of a Senate seat 
and take back a governorship from 
the Republican Party.

It does not stop in Michigan either. 

Five other states voted the ways 
Michigan did in 2016 and will have 
Democrats up for reelection in the 

Senate. The Republicans need to win 
eight seats in 2018 to gain a filibuster-
proof majority. Sanders could have a 
significant impact in six of those races. 
The math does not get any simpler.

If Sanders wants to push for 

Medicare for all and a $15 federal 
minimum wage then he needs 
allies. While being an outsider is 
part of his brand, he is going to 
eventually have to make peace with 
the 
Democratic 
establishment. 

Helping reelect Sen. Stabenow and 
putting a Democratic governor in 
Lansing would go a long way towards 
achieving that needed peace.

For any potential 2020 Democratic 

nominee, supporting Democrats, both 
incumbent and challengers, makes a lot 
of political sense. They get to put their 
name out across the country, collect 
key allies and be seen as a leader in the 
party. In fact, two of Sanders’ potential 
primary opponents, Sens. Cory Booker 
and Kamala Harris, are already 
fundraising for vulnerable incumbents.

So what’s up with Bernie Sanders?
He has both hinted at and refused 

to deny his plans on seeking the 
Democratic Party’s nomination to take 
on President Trump in 2020. However, 
he has done little to deserve it.

Sanders’ 
callous 
disregard 
for 

helping 
Democrats 
win 
in 
the 

midterms, even if it is over a year away, 
needs to change or the very future to 
believe in that he campaigned on risks 
death, especially if Republicans gain 
their Senate supermajority.

I hope to see Bernie Sanders come 

to states like mine and help Democrats 
in Michigan and elsewhere win critical 
elections. Otherwise, he can count me 
out in 2020.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

What’s up with Bernie Sanders?

it in its never-ending mission to cut 

costs, Wal-Mart also nearly dictates 

the business of its own suppliers. 

The company is often the majority of 

sales for many of its manufacturers, 

grocers and other suppliers and 

therefore enforces its ideologies 

within the walls of businesses not 

their own. From pushing facilities 

and staff to altering products to 

make them cheaper and eventually 

forcing 
companies 
to 
move 

manufacturing 
to 
cheaper, 
less 

regulated overseas locations — Wal-

Mart operates outside of the natural 

market forces.

And what this all culminates in is 

a radically different economy. Wal-

Mart, truthfully, is not a pleasant 

store to shop in. It is often crowded, 

a bit chaotic and sparse on both 

space and decoration. But again, it 

offers the lowest prices. Wal-Mart 

plays directly into our American 

consumer psychology, tempting us 

with the opportunity to save money.

We save money and, in the 

process, empty the vibrant and 

unique storefronts of downtowns 

interlaced 
with 
family-run 

restaurants 
and 
markets 
and 

instead 
build 
warehouse-sized 

shopping emporiums on acres of 

blacktop parking lots with tacky 

chain restaurants where the starved 

and bland masses can consume 

thousand-calorie meals.

We 
further 
destroy 
the 

manufacturing 
jobs 
of 
this 

country. We allow businesses to 

be outsourced overseas. We buy 

products with no care for source and 

urging — only price. And whether 

or not you personally even shop 

at Wal-Mart, this $485 billion-a-

year company dominates the retail 

economy we are all a part of.

But Wal-Mart is not evil, it did not 

set out to destroy local economies or 

alter consumer buying habits. It has 

just capitalized on our obsession 

with money.

Always low prices

T

he small towns of northern 

Michigan that dot the coast 

of the Great Lakes offer some 

escape 
from 

the chaotic and 

hyperconnected 

world we live in. 

The majority of 

Michiganders 

who grew up in the more-populated 

southern part of the state understand 

the peaceful and nostalgic nature 

of what “up north” is. Every small, 

coastal community has its own 

personality; brief visits to towns 

like Petoskey, Traverse City, Alpena 

and Harbor Springs offer their own 

unique experiences.

And part of those experiences 

are the stores and markets that 

seem almost extinct to people 

from cities — such as small family-

owned furniture stores, hardware 

outlets and supermarkets. Nearly a 

decade ago, this region of the state 

was almost completely free from 

the intrusions of the massive chain 

stores that are so much a part of 

suburban life. The local economy 

was dominated by these small 

businesses where employees worked 

in more enjoyable environments, 

specialists knew all about their 

products and uniqueness to every 

town and city was seen in the proud 

storefront windows of downtown 

shops.

But eventually, the secluded and 

small-town atmospheres grew to 

large enough sizes that a specific 

retailing corporation took notice of 

possible new markets.

Wal-Mart — the supercenter 

retailer touting the lowest prices (no 

matter the cost). The retailing giant 

that claims both titles of largest 

private employer in the world and 

largest company by revenue.

The arrival of a new Wal-Mart 

induced a transformation of these 

small towns of northern Michigan 

— and over the past decade, these 

transformations have served as 

examples of the so-called “Wal-

Mart 
effect” 
that 
has 
spread 

throughout the country. This term, 

established 
by 
journalist 
Julie 

Morris, was then expertly described 

in Charles Fishman’s book, “The 

Wal-Mart 
Effect.” 
He 
explains 

how the company drastically alters 

local economies with their stores. 

Wages become depressed, other 

retailers are forced to close and the 

shopping experience for a consumer 

is radically changed on all levels.

The 
effect 
begins 
with 
the 

construction 
of 
the 
massive 

warehouse that is often larger 

than 100,000 square feet. This 

monstrosity of a building is situated 

just a short drive from the heart 

of the city, being built remarkably 

fast and marketed to the local 

population the entire time. Upon 

completion, the draw of the entire 

institution that has led Wal-Mart 

to such incredible success begins 

siphoning consumers from other 

businesses — Wal-Mart’s “always 

low prices.”

Wal-Mart’s driving ideology since 

its founding by Sam Walton in 1962 

has been to offer the lowest price to 

consumers. That ideology still holds 

today, and yet this simple, successful 

and almost innocent ideology has 

had serious consequences that are 

easily identifiable in the towns 

which these stores arrive.

For when a Wal-Mart arrives, it 

immediately begins driving local 

prices down, competing with other 

retailers. We as consumers are 

complicit in this act because Wal-

Mart offers to us an opportunity 

we cannot pass over — saving 

money, getting a deal, paying less. 

Consumers are attracted to the 

remarkably low prices offered by 

Wal-Mart and cease to buy from 

other retailers. Why pay more for a 

piece of furniture from some local 

family store when Wal-Mart offers it 

for less? Why pay more for clothing or 

groceries or toys or nearly anything 

for that matter? Consumers cannot 

pass up the opportunity to pay less, 

and in the process local business 

slowly die off.

Pushing cost cutting measures 

to new heights, Wal-Mart’s profit 

margin 
has 
always 
existed 
as 

remarkably 
lower 
than 
other 

competitors, yet in the end, the 

company 
succeeds 
because 
it 

drives competition out of business. 

In addition to the small local 

businesses, other department stores 

and retailers such as Sears, JCPenny 

and Kmart have been unable to 

compete with Wal-Mart’s almost 

ruthless corporate mission. “The 

lowest price” may seem like an 

innocent and simple ideology for a 

company — yet when that company 

makes $485 billion dollars a year in 

revenue, the effects are astounding.

As Charles Fishman writes in 

“The Wal-Mart Effect,” the company 

“is increasingly beyond the control 

of market forces that capitalism 

relies on to enforce fair play. Wal-

Mart isn’t subject to the market 

forces because it is creating them.”

Christopher 
Nolan 

(“Interstellar”) 
has 
wedged 

himself between two starkly 
different subgenres of film: 
cerebral, understated thrillers 
and large-scale blockbusters. 
His earlier movies, like the 
masterful 
“Memento,” 
forgo 

grandiose special effects in 
favor of mind-bending plots, 
whereas his recent releases 
favor mind-bending cinematic 
techniques rather than tightly 
structured plots. Sometimes, it 
feels like he writes messy plots 
to appear complex and cerebral 
without actually having much 
substance 
— 
Nolan 
fanboys 

can leave the theater feeling, 
like, 
“totally 
mind 
blown, 

bro” 
without 
understanding 

anything about the movie. But 
nonetheless, Nolan has a vision 
perfectly suited for the summer 
blockbuster; he deserves all of 
the credit he gets, reshaping the 
action movie genre as we know 
it.

“Dunkirk” is an amalgamation 

of his greatest talents jampacked 
into 106 minutes of some of 
the most inspired filmmaking 
in 
recent 
years. 

Undoubtedly, this 
is Nolan’s finest 
movie 
and 
the 

most 
compelling, 

honest war film 
since 2009’s “The 
Hurt Locker.”

The 
movie 
is 

set 
during 
the 

Battle of Dunkirk, 
where hundreds of 
thousands of Allied 
troops were forced to retreat to 
the French port town’s beaches 
along the English Channel after 
suffering horrendous casualties 
to the Germans. Its British 
perspective 
is 
a 
refreshing 

take on the war genre and an 
obvious reminder that World 
War II was being fought years 
before American involvement. 
“Dunkirk” does not shy away 
from the overarching sense of 
hopelessness and defeat Allied 
forces felt in the earliest years 
of the War, and the entire movie 
focuses on the effort to evacuate 
the 
thousands 
of 
stranded 

British troopsx.

“Dunkirk” is split into three 

locations — the beach, the 
sea and the air — all focusing 
on different perspectives of 
the evacuation. What’s most 
compelling, though, is Nolan’s 
storytelling 
technique. 
Like 

“Memento” 
and 
“Inception,” 

Nolan experiments with time, 
but in this case, with much 
more subtlety — “Dunkirk” still 
follows chronological order, but 
with a slight tweak. The movie’s 
three 
parts 
show 
separate 

efforts 
of 
the 
evacuation 

process occurring over different 
amounts of time. This addition 
is just enough to make the 
story that much more dynamic, 
ultimately becoming a collage 
of three heroic tales that are 
dependant on one another.

The story along the beach 

occurs over one week and 
focuses on Tommy, a timid 
British soldier played by Fionn 
Whitehead in his first on-screen 
appearance. Here, the troops 
dodge frequent bombing runs 
while waiting for Naval rescue 
ships, many of which end up 
sinking anyway. On the water, 
Mark 
Rylance 
(“Bridge 
of 

Spies”) stars as Mr. Dawson, a 
mariner who agrees to take his 
private boat across the Channel 

to 
Dunkirk 

in an attempt 
to assist the 
evacuation 
effort. He is 
accompanied 
by 
his 
son 

Peter 
(Tom 

Glynn-
Carney) 
and 

George (Barry 
Keoghan, 
“71”), another 

teenage helper. These events on 
Dawson’s boat occur over one 
day. The story in the air occurs 
only over one hour and revolves 
around three RAF pilots as they 
provide air support during the 
evacuation. By creating three 
perspectives, Nolan leaves us 
anxiously awaiting to discover 
how each story connects with 
the other.

Along 
with 
Rylance, 

“Dunkirk” 
boasts 
some 
of 

today’s top actors. Tom Hardy 
(“Mad Max: Fury Road”) stars 
as Farrier, a heroic RAF pilot, 
and even though his dialogue 
is 
nearly 
indistinguishable 

over the noise of the plane, his 

performance is still, somehow, 
compelling. And as much as 
it pains me to say, even Harry 
Styles’s performance as Alex, a 
British soldier, is solid. However, 
the characters are never the 
movie’s focal point: Nolan uses 
them simply as buffers to tell 
the story, characterizing them 
enough to still be interesting, 
though never diving too deep 
into their personal lives. We 
grow to care about the main 
characters, like Mr. Dawson and 
Tommy, but never get distracted 
from the underlying tension that 
builds throughout the movie.

Nolan’s screenplay sticks out 

as the movie’s strongest point, 
even considering the visceral 
practical effects and stunning 
cinematography. There isn’t one 
scene that feels superfluous: 
It’s Nolan’s tightest and most 
concise story to date. In many 
ways, “Dunkirk” could have no 
dialogue and still be equally 
gripping. We care about the 
characters, but what they have 
to say is of little importance. 
Instead, we care about what 
happens to them, and this lends 
itself to some heartbreaking 
moments. Ultimately, the movie 
is 
a 
slowburner 
— 
tension 

continuously builds until it 
boils over — but it doesn’t have 
a dull second. Even from the 
opening scene, where Tommy 
avoids enemy fire, every bit of 
action enthralls.

From watching a massive 

boat 
sink 
into 
the 
ocean 

to a dogfight between two 
airplanes, “Dunkirk”’s action 
sequences are stunning yet 
haunting. It shows the horrors 
of war without needing to be 
excessively gory. Some of the 
most vivid imagery comes from 
scenes where no explosions are 
occurring, and Hans Zimmer’s 
score only adds more depth to 
the underlying tension.

Nolan 
pioneered 
the 

superhero 
subgenre 
with 

his 
“Batman” 
trilogy 
with 

no prior experience in this 
genre beforehand. And now, 
“Dunkirk” 
is 
as 
equally 

innovative for the modern war 
movie. 
Nolan 
is 
frequently 

talked about as a visionary 
genius, one of modern cinema’s 
most influential directors: I 
now completely agree with this 
assessment.

‘Dunkirk’ is Nolan’s best

MOVIE REVIEW

Lana finds ‘Lust’

Lana Del Rey — originally one of 

pop music’s most debated figures — 
has created a lane of her own after 
five studio releases in just as many 
years. Following a rocky outset with 
nearly spiteful reviews of her debut 
Born To Die, Del Rey has steadily 
released ever-evolving work: each 
consecutive 
project 
adding 
to 

her catalogue like a new book in 
a series, each one unmistakably 
written by the same author and 
told through the same protagonist’s 
eyes, swapping out plot points for 
production techniques.

Born 
To 
Die’s 
trip-hop, 

Ultraviolence’s 
brooding 
rock 

and Honeymoon’s baroque jazz 
are singular in their productions, 
but they approach life from the 
same place: mourning the past, 
sulking in the present or altogether 
dreaming up an alternate reality. 
One of Del Rey’s greatest strengths 
as a storyteller and 
vocalist is her ability to 
blur the line between 
biography and fantasy 
so 
flawlessly 
that 

listeners are forced to 
take all or none.

Lust for Life is Del Rey’s longest, 

most diverse album. Though it 
incorporates production techniques 
from all of her previous releases, 
Lust for Life seems like a direct 
follow-up to Born to Die. Aside from 
the obvious title dynamics, the 
albums’ covers parallel one another 
with Del Rey standing in the center, 
title above head, name below, with 
a pick-up truck behind her. One 
key difference: She smiles on Lust 
for Life, a first for any of her album 
covers.

As a whole, Lust for Life isn’t 

as striking as Ultraviolence or 
Honeymoon because it’s not an 

exploration of genre and tone in 
addition to one of Del Rey’s psyche. 
Lust for Life holds itself together 
across a varied production of 
trap drums and folk strings by 
blurring lyrical lines instead of 
instrumentals, carrying phrases 
and images across the album (She 
rhymes “summer” and “bummer” 
in the opening lines of “White 
Mustang,” endless references to 
beaches outside of “13 Beaches” and 
she even slides in “It’s more than just 
a video game” on “Beautiful People, 
Beautiful Problems”).

Lana’s 
unshakeable 
self-

awareness is the cornerstone of this 
record; it not only allows her to troll 
the audience with meta-hipster 
lyrics delivered with a wink and a 
smile, but it also allows her to shift 
her perspective into the very real 
Trump-era, talk about her hope for 
the future and confront both the 
demons and the men she’s toyed 
with for the past four releases.

Lust for Life is full of firsts for 

Del Rey. It’s the first time she’s 

approached 
unadulterated joy 
and 
expressed 

hope for the future 
(“Love,” “Lust for 
Life,” 
“Change”). 

It’s the first time 

she has had features on her own 
albums, 
perfectly 
representing 

the genres from which she pulls 
inspiration (The Weeknd, Playboi 
Carti and A$AP Rocky) and the 
iconography she has always called 
on (Stevie Nicks and Sean Ono 
Lennon).

”Who’s tougher than this bitch? / 

Who’s freer than me?” she breathes 
on “In My Feelings,” one of Lust For 
Life’s standout tracks. For the last 
five years, Del Rey has pretty much 
done what she wants when she 
wants and that has yet to fail her — 
Lust for Life is a worthy addition to 
her stacked catalogue.

Tyler, the Creator awkwardly gazing 
Tyler gets serious 

What’s coming of age really 

about, anyway? Is it when you finally 
actualize that vision of “cool” you’ve 
had since you were 13? Is it supposed 
to happen right when you turn old 
enough to rent a car? Or maybe 
it’s when you realize that the only 
person thinking critically about your 
life is you.

It’s no secret that most of the 

conversations surrounding Tyler, 
the Creator’s latest effort, Flower Boy 
(unofficially Scum Fuck Flower Boy, 
which is obviously way cooler), have 
been around his apparent “coming 
out.” As in, he likes guys.

Despite 
Tyler’s 
long 
history 

of homophobia, he’s hinted (or 
even been quite explicit about) 
his orientation for a while now. 
Over two years ago, Ernest Baker 
wrote a classic profile on Tyler for 
Rolling Stone magazine where he 
might have been the first to ask 
the question, but Tyler’s public 
demeanor is so hilariously blunt that 
it’s often hard to take him seriously.

Tyler wants us to take him 

seriously now. No more Hopsin-
esque album cuts that feel like 
deadpan parodies of (sigh) New Rap, 
or bullshit “I’m a rapper that doesn’t 
listen to rap music” music. Instead of 
hiding behind absurdist humor or his 
Cool New Friends (see: “Smuckers”), 
Tyler fleshes out a lot of his musical 
influences into something he can 
call uniquely his own, while also 
growing the courage to say “serious 
things,” well, seriously.

Flower Boy is also masterfully 

sequenced. Some of Tyler’s earlier 
projects were so scattered that it 
almost exaggerated runtime, where 
this album just seems to melt away, 

like the car rides and afternoons 
that surely inspired it. “Where 
This Flower Blooms” sees Frank 
ghost in and out with a classically 
unbothered hook before you even 
know it. Tyler raps about various 
skin-care treatments and smelling 
like Chanel. He’s also found a way to 
integrate acoustic elements without 
sounding like some sort of Mac 
Demarco tribute.

On “Sometimes…,” a gorgeous 

interlude placed on the album solely 
to set the “Route 66” mise-en-scène, 
a “Golf Radio” broadcaster angrily 
asks for a song request; quite tellingly, 
“the song about me” comes from 
the voice of a boy. What follows is 
probably the song that Tyler has 
been gunning for his entire career. 

“See You Again” has the bounce 
of Neptunes-era Pharrell, mixed 
with arrangements from Late 
Registration-era ‘Ye, and finally, 
the same keyboard setting Tyler 
has been using since his bedroom 
production days on Bastard. Kali 
Uchis sounds like the vocalist 
Tyler has been searching for 
since “Treehome 95,” and really, 
she’s tailored for the flowery 
soundscapes of the album.

The song is also probably 

the first time we hear Tyler 
seriously flow behind the mic; I 
can think of one Harlem Pretty 
Boy who’s probably responsible 
for this. That “Glitter” twists and 
turns so uncontrollably, and yet 
Tyler matches it beat for beat, is 
definitely a sign that he’s been 

working on his pen game.

Speaking of Rocky, the latter 

half of “Glitter” even has Tyler 
screwing his own voice down as 
if this were some sort of UGK 
record. It’s hard to listen without 
seeing him dance in specifically 
green high water pants and 
whatever shoe he’s been working 
on. It’s the perfect Tyler song.

Wolf and Cherry Bomb also had 

these spurts of brilliance, but were 
diluted by Tyler’s willingness to 
piss on his own albums. Flower 
Boy is the first time he really 
indulges in his natural talents and 
quits trying to recreate N.E.R.D’s 
In Search Of… intro. The only bad 
patch of the album is a track that 
Tyler actually thought would be a 
good lead single; “Who Dat Boy” 
is another song about Tyler not 
shopping at the mall, with wonky 
percussion that was probably 
played with his fists. It’s a waste of 
a Rocky feature, as I’m sure they 
had at least 10 tracks together that 
would have been a better fit.

“November” has a synth line 

that almost slithers from start to 
finish, etching an outline for Tyler 
to release his manic thoughts all 
at once. “What if Clancy fucked 
me over? / What if ‘Who Dat Boy’ 
is rhetorical and this shit is over? 
/ What if I’m hustling backwards? 
What if my accountant ain’t payin’ 
my taxes? / Fillin’ his pockets and 
IRS show up asking me questions.”

The track is a tribute to those 

times where every hour is the 
“magic hour” — those times you get 
nostalgic for when your favorite song 
from 8th grade pops up on shuffle. 
“Take me back...” goes the bridge. 

CONCERT REVIEW

Los Angeles, CA — As evening 

turned to night on Sat., July 22, a 
sense of awe set into the crowd at 
FYF Festival, with some attendees 
still seemingly in disbelief that 
Frank Ocean — who had cancelled 
on the same gig just two years 
prior, plus a few others earlier this 
summer — was going to perform at 
all. Though I had seen him live once 
before, this neither minimized the 
mystery nor lessened my excitement 
as I stood packed against thousands 
of sweaty strangers, calves and 
heels splintering from a full day 
of standing, awaiting Mr. Ocean’s 
starry-skied summer set. Despite 
his act’s fabled status and already-
visible staging (a long catwalk 
teased its expansion deep into the 
crowd), little else was known of 
what would come from the cultish 
crooner, who had not perfromed 
for a North American audience in 
nearly five years.

Frank Ocean is prone to silence 

and public exile. In 2012, just as 
his internet hype began flowering 
into real breakout stardom via the 
success of his studio debut, Channel 
Orange, he paused his career to go 
soul-searching in Shanghai, telling 
The New York Times of his plans to 
write “in remote locations” for about 
two years. This patient process 
would later inform his stunning 
sophomore LP blond with piercingly 
potent emotion, earning it wide 
acclaim and confirming Ocean’s 
status as the hyper-coveted — yet 
guarded, often distant — songwriter 
of the current decade. With FYF 
Festival offering the first chance 
to see his new material performed 
in America, the anticipation was 
nearly fervent.

At 11:00 PM, Ocean walked 

onstage with the poise of a seasoned 
pastor, 
complete 
with 
noise-

cancelling headphones and a Nike 
t-shirt — a vintage collaboration 
made with John Lennon and 
bearing the phrase: “INSTANT 
KARMA.” Surely there was some 
irony in his choice to come out to 
“Pretty Sweet,” a chaotic collage of 
strings and sound effects that almost 
intentionally misaligned with the 
serenity of the rest of the set. But a 
purer paradox came just moments 
later, when Ocean was joined by the 
roaring masses, right from the very 
first syllable, in the recitation of his 
chilling ode to independence, “Solo.”

“Hand me a towel, I’m dirty 

dancing!”

Ocean sang, standing plainly 

at the foot of his stage, rocking an 
almost indifferent calm. The stage 
featured a set of chairs (built in Tom 
Sach’s studio), which would later be 
occupied by an orchestral backing, 
an inanimate pile of boomboxes and 
some instruments, together leaving 
just enough room for Ocean to roam 
at the lip. In the background, close-
ups of his face and artistic portraits 
of the performance were displayed 
on stadium-sized screens, looking 
something like a concert film made 
live. Together, it all worked to create 
a feeling of being there, right in the 
studio with Frank.

“My guy pretty like a girl!”
“Chanel” was next on the setlist, 

the first of three singles recently 
released on Frank’s Blonded radio 
show, and the intensity with which 
the crowd — even its heterosexual 
males — screamed out the lyrics is a 
true testament to their captivation. 
Afterward, Ocean thanked fans for 
their participation and promised, 
“We gon’ get to some other shit in 
a second.” Not quite yet, though: 
Before moving on, Ocean would 
perform “Lens” and “Biking (Solo),” 
two other newer singles, plus “In 
Here Somewhere / Comme Des 
Garcon,” a bouncy track off his slept-
on visual album, Endless.

When Ocean did finally arrive 

at blond though, what proceeded 
was a truly breathtaking exercise 
in patience and musical expertise. 
Kneeling down to play a keyboard 
from the floor, he performed an 
extended rendition of “Good 
Guy” twice because he believed 
that he messed up the first one, 
hitting high notes that felt truly 
spiritual while simultaneously 
employing 
the 
song’s 
empty 

spaces, their silences proving 
contagious. Then, he dove into 
a similarly extended cut of “Self 
Control,” rapping over its heart-
wrenching guitar riff for nearly a 
minute (with lines like, “Bounce 
remixes of Aaliyah had the 
spinal chord crackin’ / Cups of 
‘methazine had ‘em leaning like 
Michael Jackson”) before finally 
arriving at the song’s beloved 
intro (“Poolside convos, about 
your summer last night”), which 
naturally invited the crowd to 
chime in in full force.

Animal rights activists trot out deer to oppose cull 

By CHETALI JAIN

Summer Daily News Editor

In 2014, the city of Ann Arbor 

was inundated with complaints 
from residents who were concerned 
about the growing deer population. 
Their grievances, which included 

landscaping 
damage 
and 
deer-

vehicle collisions, prompted the city 
to vote to handle the situation with 
four years of culling.

The Ann Arbor Non-Lethal Deer 

Management — an organization of 
residents who are concerned with 
the well-being of the deer population 

in the area — held a special event 
Sunday afternoon at the Creature 
Conservancy where attendees could 
learn of ways to protect the lives of 
the cervine wildlife from the culling 
and interact with live deer.

Lorraine Shapiro, president of 

the Ann Arbor Non-Lethal Deer 

Management, explained that the 
white-tailed deer are losing their 
habitats in the city and are being 
crowded out due to developments 
and urban sprawl. Shapiro believed 
that sterilization of the animals is a 
more ethical way to manage the deer 
without ending their lives.

“I feel it is inhumane to kill animals 

who 
are 
completely 
innocent,” 

Shapiro 
said. 
“They’re 
being 

punished for living basically. This 
past winter, we were able to have the 
city agree to a plan where they would 
do culling and deer sterilization.”

The 
non-lethal 
surgical 

sterilization method, a procedure in 
which the deer’s ovaries are removed, 
turned out to be quite successful 
as an addition to the 2017 deer 
management efforts: 54 deer were 
sterilized in a week, and all, with the 
exception of one deer who perished 
due to non-surgical related reasons, 
survived and returned to the wild.

Non-lethal methods of population 

management, such as sterilization, 
face 
many 
barriers, 
however. 

Though the operation is almost 100 
percent successful and relatively 
quick, lasting only about 20 minutes, 
the deer must be given painkillers 
and antibiotics, and they must be 
monitored before being released 
back into the wild, according to a 
PowerPoint presentation given at the 
event. Thus, the price to sterilize a 
deer is around $1,200. By comparison, 
it costs approximately $450 to shoot a 
deer. 

The group acknowledged the 

financial burden posed by more 
humane efforts and emphasized that 
one of their goals is to minimize the 
role of culling by offsetting the cost 
of nonlethal routes. This past winter, 
they contributed over $12,000 to the 
city of Ann Arbor to help fund the 
ovariectomies.

Despite the financial assistance 

and support of many animal activists, 
the Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources permitted the surgeries 
to take place with a stipulation: the 
ovariectomies had to be done in the 
context of a research project.

According to the group’s treasurer, 

Sabra 
Sanzotta, 
this 
non-lethal 

method of deer management was not 
acceptable to the city unless there 
was another reason for doing so — in 
this case, scientific studies.

“What we hope to do is find 

ways to make those sterilizations 
more acceptable and more widely 
applicable, and they don’t always have 
to be done under research prefaces,” 
Sanzotta said. “(We hope) to promote 

birth control methods, as well.”

One of the birth control methods 

Sanzotta referred to is PZP, a vaccine 
that, when administered to a female 
animal, causes antibodies to form 
that 
prevent 
fertilization 
from 

occurring in that creature.

Numerous 
roadblocks 
have 

prevented this non-lethal avenue 
from being explored in the Ann 
Arbor deer management efforts. The 
contraceptive was recently licensed 
by the Environmental Protection 
Agency to help control wildlife 
populations, but because it is still 
classified as a pesticide, many harbor 
opposition towards its usage. Shapiro 
expressed hope that its usage would 
become widespread and widely 
accepted in coming years.

Leaders from the Ann Arbor 

Non-Lethal 
Deer 
Management 

organization also outlined ways for 
volunteers to make a difference and 
aid efforts to protect the lives of the 
deer in Ann Arbor. 

Beatrice Friedlander, president 

of the Board of Directors of 
Attorneys for Animals — a nonprofit 
organization of legal professionals 
who advocate for animal rights — 
attended the event to lend her support 
and meet the deer. Friedlander, a 
retired lawyer, said it is important to 
be practical in the realm of animal 
advocacy and to avoid dogmatism.

“Compromise (becomes) a bad 

word,” Friedlander said. “While it 
is important that we maintain our 
standards and ethics… it’s important 
to live in the real world and work with 
others. I’ve been involved in animal 
issues for 25 to 30 years…I had a dog 
(in law school) and I developed such 
a strong relationship with her; I think 
that made me realize how important 
animals were and how mistreated 
they were.”

Though residential complaints 

brought the matter to the city’s 
attention and sparked the culling 
practice back in 2015, there were 
many 
residents 
who 
morally 

opposed the killing and the 
trouble it posed. In 2016, many 
Ann Arbor parks were shut down 
to 
accommodate 
the 
culling 

efforts, to the dismay of residents 
who questioned the ethics of the 
cull and the inconvenience of 
closed parks. Sixty-three deer 
were euthanized that year.

“We 
decided 
to 
take 
a 

pragmatic 
approach,” 
Shapiro 

said. “We can save a bunch of deer 
through sterilization. Maybe we 
have to put up with culling at the 
moment.”

Immigant 
Sangreet

By SAMIHA MATIN

Michigan in Color Contributor

The taxi driver asks where I’m from

 I reply Bangladesh
 And he finds comfort in it somehow.
 
He doesn’t say my English is good
 Or why am I here?
 in a curious tone
 
that fringes on people’s privacy. I am a little thankful.
 
He tells me he’s from Nigeria. He asks whether I like the Michigan cold.
I say, I do, I’ve gotten used to it. Like I’ve gotten used to
 feeling my accent twist and shift
 diving into a word-drenched river
of cleansing and good fortune.
 
He tells me his brother lives in California, always hoping he’d come.
But he hates the blinding desert heat
 reminding of home, Abuja
 rooted in melancholic pulchritude –
the motherlands we hate, escaped and love beyond compare.
 
We start to reminisce about the corruption and politicians
our cataclysmic survivals in sailing humor
 And we feel proud and then tragic
 When we acknowledge
 
The nostalgic lonely
nobody expects us to be
 
and he says
 things might have been better
 if he hadn’t uprooted
then he shrugs
 no, it wouldn’t have been
 there’s an inkling of promise here
 and he’d be home in some years
 
the pendulum always intrigued me. initially, it was 
nothing more than a small metal ball that we 
swung from one end to another. we measured the 
time it took to travel back to where it started, the 
pendulum reaching the highest height at the first 
push. equipped with so much force to defy gravity. 
it soared fearlessly against air drag, curving a 
trajectory to touch the sun.

after the first travel, the pendulum never came 
back home. it could no longer reach its amplitude. 
it started to lose its voluntarism. its sense of pur
pose and direction. its velocity was taken away. the 
pendulum stayed in a state of stasis in the 
equilibrium. weightless. stationary. forceless.

MiC

Spotlight: 
Managing 

Editors

By JASON ROWLAND and ASHLEY 
 

TJHUNG

Michigan in Color Managing 

Editors

In the MiC Spotlight series, our 

editors and contributors reflect on 
the reasons they joined MiC and their 
hopes for their work and the section.

The stories we tell are so impor-

tant because they bridge people from 
completely 
different 
backgrounds 

and interests. In a few words, I joined 
Michigan in Color for the chance to 
mold a space for the stories of our 
campus’s most marginalized voices. 
Hopefully, MiC will lead to more 
understanding on our campus, but 
the first step in fostering tolerance is 
simply having our stories be told.

As for me, I’m a second-year stu-

dent 
majoring 
in 
organizational 

studies. For the past few years, I’ve 
been heavily active with nonprofits 
in the predominantly low-income, 
and majority-minority, city of Nor-
ristown, Penn. From these experi-
ences, I’ve learned that minimum 
wage is more than just a point on a 
graph, prejudice and its effects exist 
outside of history books, and unequal 

access to opportunity can lock 
the most loving families in a 
vicious cycle of poverty. Addi-
tionally, I realize that these 
issues of debt, poverty and 
discrimination are not just 
local ones. These are prob-
lems that affect every corner 
of the world, and, as such, 
these are issues that are not 
going away anytime soon.

While as a student I can’t 

single-handedly fix the prob-
lems outlined above, I can do 
my part to relay the lessons 
I’ve learned from my experi-
ences — as well as help craft a 
section for others to share their 
own. Hopefully, readers from 
similar backgrounds can relate 
to these stories, while people 
who are radically different 
can still use our testimonies to 
educate themselves about situ-
ations of institutional inequal-
ity. However, at the very least, 
I’m excited to give a voice to the 
people who have historically 
been silenced.

-Jason Rowland

One year ago, when I first 

began my journey at MiC, I 
wrote about being excited to 
facilitate a space for people 
of color to share their expe-
riences and to provide sup-
port for those brave enough 
to share their stories. While 
these are still major reasons 
why I returned to MiC as a 
co-managing editor, I can’t 
help but think about how 
much this section has grown, 

and the huge potential still 
here. Thanks to the amazing 
dedication and hard work of 
previous editors before me, 
MiC has grown from a single 
column to a true section at the 
Daily while also continuing to 
be solely produced by people 
of color. For me, returning to 
MiC is to pay homage to Toni 
Wang, 
Demario 
Longmire, 

Alyssa Brandon, Sabrina Bili-
moria and all the past editors 
who worked to create such a 
unique space for PoC on this 
campus.

As the University of Michi-

gan celebrates its bicentennial, 
it is important to reflect on the 
history of racial relations here, 
the strides which have been 
made, and the work that still 
needs to be done. MiC is a tes-
tament to the strength of the 
PoC who fought for the right 
to attend this university, and 
those who continue to fight for 
the right to belong and be sup-
ported. MiC exists for many 
reasons, above all to provide 
support to oppressed voices, 
but as the section evolves it’s 
evident we have also become 
a check on those who wish to 
silence us. We, as a community 
of contributors, readers and 
editors, are a powerful force. 
The University is turning 
200, and we will not let them 
exclude us from the narrative.

MiC is loud and only get-

ting louder.

Wagner, Germany finish seventh at 
FIBA U-20 World Championships

Last year, Moritz Wagner 

passed on the opportunity to 
represent his native Germany in 
the 2016 FIBA U-20 European 
Championship. 
Instead, 
he 

chose to spend the summer 
in Ann Arbor to continue to 
develop as a college basketball 
player, working with strength 
and 
conditioning 
coach 
Jon 

Sanderson to get bigger and 
stronger.

That decision paid dividends 

during his sophomore season 
with 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team. 
Wagner 

averaged 12.1 points and 4.2 
rebounds per game and shot 
39.5 percent from three-point 
range and 56 percent overall. 
He garnered first-round NBA 
Draft consideration as a versatile 
6-foot-11 forward with a smooth 
shooting 
stroke, 
but 
opted 

instead to return to school for 
his junior year.

This summer, a more polished 

and developed Wagner returned 

to Germany to compete for his 
country at the U-20 European 
Championship, 
which 
took 

place in Greece from July 15-23. 
He helped lead Germany to 
a seventh-place finish in the 
16-team tournament, leading the 
team in scoring (16.1 per game) 
and rebounding (5.3 per game).

Amongst all players, Wagner 

tied for 11th in scoring and 
shooting percentage and fifth in 
free-throw shooting in just over 
20 minutes per game.

Wagner’s 
tournament 
was 

highlighted 
by 
a 
dominant 

32-point performance on 12-for-
19 shooting against Iceland in 
the tournament’s seventh-place 
game Sunday, which Germany 
won, 79-73. With 6:15 to play in 
the third quarter and Germany 
trailing, 48-41, Wagner took 
over the contest in the span of 
a minute and a half, scoring 10 
straight points to give his team 
the lead for good.

The 
Berlin 
native 
had 
a 

shaky start to the tournament, 
averaging just eight points per 
game in the group stage. In a 

loss to Sweden in the opening 
game, he scored just six points 
on 2-for-13 shooting. But Wagner 
rebounded to record five straight 
double-digit scoring outings in 
which he averaged 19.8 points.

In a Round of 16 win over 

Turkey, Wagner put up 23 points 
on 8-for-14 shooting. He scored 
seven points in the final period, 
including a key alley-oop dunk 
with 28 seconds to play to put 
Germany up by four points. 
Wagner also scored 23 points in 
a semifinal loss to Lithuania.

Wagner will certainly hope 

to carry the momentum and 
experience 
from 
his 
strong 

performance 
in 
international 

play into his junior season with 
the Wolverines, as they attempt 
to reload after the departures 
of Derrick Walton Jr., Zak Irvin 
and DJ Wilson. Wagner showed 
at the U-20 Championship that 
he can be the focal point for 
his team, and as Michigan’s top 
returning scorer and rebounder 
from last season, he may be 
expected to fill that role next 
season.

Michigan announces hiring of Fetter as new pitching coach

The Michigan baseball team 

had the top pitching staff in the 
Big Ten during 2017, in terms of 
runs allowed, earned-run average, 
strikeouts and opponents’ batting 
average.

However, one of the people 

most responsible for that success — 
pitching coach Sean Kenny — left 
after the season to take the same 
position at Georgia.

Kenny’s 
replacement 
was 

announced Monday in Chris Fetter, 
a former Wolverine hurler who 
most recently was the minor league 
pitching coordinator for MLB’s Los 
Angeles Dodgers, a job he took last 
November.

Fetter played four seasons at 

Michigan as a right-handed pitcher 
from 2006-2009, during which 
the Wolverines won three Big Ten 
championships and made four 
NCAA Tournament appearances. 

He was named an All-American 
his junior season after he went 10-2 
with a 2.47 ERA, and won All-Big 
Ten Honors three times as well.

To this day, Fetter holds program 

records for most innings pitched 
with 332.1, and also ranks third in 
wins (28), fifth in strikeouts (281) 
and eighth in ERA (3.11, minimum 
150 innings).

After the San Diego Padres 

selected Fetter in the ninth round 
of the 2009 MLB Draft, he spent 
four seasons in their minor league 
system, but never advanced farther 
than Single-A baseball.

Once his playing career was over, 

Fetter remained in professional 
baseball. He joined the coaching 
staff of the San Diego Missions, the 
Padres’ Double-A affiliate, for the 
2013 season, and also spent three 
years as a scout for the Los Angeles 
Angels.

Fetter returned to the collegiate 

ranks in 2016 when he became 
the pitching coach at Ball State, 

reuniting with his former head 
coach at Michigan, Rich Maloney, 
who 
currently 
coaches 
the 

Cardinals. Under Fetter’s guidance, 
Ball State went 33-26 in 2016 and 
recorded the second-best team ERA 
in the Mid-American conference.

“His professional background 

combined with his loyalty and 
love for Michigan made Chris an 
obvious target from the start,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
in a press release. “He had an 
incredible Wolverine career as 
an All-American, three-time Big 
Ten champion, made four straight 
regional appearances and played in 
one super regional. Chris returning 
to Michigan to be our pitching coach 
further solidifies an extremely 
bright future for our program as 
we build on the championship 
success he experienced as a player 
while developing top professional 
prospects.”

While the Wolverines’ pitching 

staff 
was 
mostly 
dominant 

this season, Fetter will have a 
challenging task on his hands, as 
Michigan will have to replace 59 
percent of its innings and 62 percent 
of its strikeouts from 2017. Three of 
the Wolverines’ top four starters 
— Oliver Jaskie, Ryan Nutof and 
Michael Hendrickson — are now 
in professional baseball after being 
selected in last month’s MLB Draft, 
and their top two relievers — Mac 
Lozer, who plays professionally, and 
Jackson Lamb, who retired — are 
gone as well.

However, Michigan still has the 

potential for a strong staff in 2018 
behind right-hander Alec Rennard 
(6-2, 4.43 ERA, 65 strikeouts in 
65 innings), left-hander William 
Tribucher (2.63 ERA, 43 strikeouts 
in 37 innings) and right-hander 
Jayce Vancena (3-1, 3.00 ERA, .220 
opponents’ average). As freshmen, 
Tommy Henry, Karl Kauffman 
and 
Jack 
Weisenburger 
made 

an immediate impact out of the 
bullpen, combining for a 2.88 ERA 

and 55 strikeouts in 50 innings, and 
all three could be in line for larger 
roles this season. The Wolverines 
also bring in two freshman pitchers 
— Jeff Criswell and Angelo Smith 
— who were selected in the MLB 
Draft.

The success that Michigan has 

had in developing pitchers under 
Kenny — the Wolverines have 
had nine pitchers go on to play 
professionally in the last five years 
— is something that Fetter will 
surely hope to continue.

“My wife, Jessica, and I couldn’t 

be more excited to return home 
to Michigan,” Fetter said in a 
statement. “This university holds a 
special place in my heart, and to be 
able to come back and join Coach 
Bakich’s staff is a dream come true. 
The culture Erik has created and 
his vision for the future is beyond 
impressive, and I look forward to 
rejoining the Michigan baseball 
family and leading the pitching 
staff for years to come.”

Peters, O’Korn pushing Speight 
for starting quarterback job

CHICAGO — Wilton Speight 

began and ended last season as 
the starting quarterback of the 
Michigan football team. And, 
objectively speaking, it was a 
pretty damn good debut.

Speight, 
now 
a 
redshirt 

junior, threw for 2,538 yards 
and completed 62 percent of his 
passes, with 18 touchdowns and 
7 interceptions. Jim Harbaugh 
said at Big Ten Media Days that 
he wants a quarterback who can 
move the ball down the field, 
score touchdowns and avoid 
turnovers — which Speight was 
able to do much of the time he 
was on the field.

None 
of 
that, 
however, 

guarantees that Speight will be 
this year’s starting quarterback, 
especially with a coach who 
constantly preaches the virtue of 
meritocracy.

“Yes, so Wilton’s in a good 

spot,” Harbaugh said Tuesday. 
“He comes in really tied for first 
with John O’Korn and Brandon 
Peters, 
legitimately, 
through 

competition, 
throughout 
all 

the spring, went through 15 
practices and was in a dead 
heat. But the good news is 
they all did some things that 
really -- Brandon really shot 
up. John O’Korn really played 
consistently good. And Wilton 

really 
had 
some 
impressive 

moments as well.

“We’ll go through training 

camp starting on Monday, just 
throw the balls out there and 
let the fellows compete. There’s 
a lot a quarterback can do over 
the summer to get better at 
playing quarterback. It’s one of 
those positions, like a kicker. A 
quarterback can just go out there 
and throw balls on the net, can 
work on their drops. There’s a lot 
of ways that they don’t even need 
other players to be out there to 
improve some part of their skill 
game.”

While 
Speight 
is 
the 

incumbent and has an entire 
season as the starter to work 
off of, both Peters and O’Korn 
have flashed their potential 
plenty of times. O’Korn is more 
experienced, having served as 
the starting quarterback for a 
high-powered Houston offense 
before transferring to Michigan 
in 2015. With an injured Speight 
on the sidelines, O’Korn started 
against 
Indiana, 
competing 

7-of-16 passes for 59 yards and 
adding a crucial 30-yard run 
that helped the Wolverines pull 
away.

Peters, meanwhile, redshirted 

his 
freshman 
season 
before 

emerging in the competition 
in spring. He had the best 
performance 
among 
all 

quarterbacks 
in 
Michigan’s 

spring game, completing 9-of-
17 passes for 160 yards with one 
touchdown 
and 
interception 

each. He displayed his mobility, 
as well, as he got out of the 
pocket at times and added a 
12-yard rushing touchdown.

The biggest area for Peters to 

improve? His vocality, according 
to Harbaugh.

“He’s got a personality that’s 

very quiet. … He’s kind of real 
quiet,” Harbaugh said. “There’s 
one thing that’s easy to do as a 
quarterback, just take charge. 
Be loud, and that doesn’t come 
natural to him. Just take charge, 
you know? Be loud. It’s really 
easy. Huhhhhhhhh! Be loud. Blue 
80! Blue 80! That’s the easiest 
thing about being a quarterback 
to me. Just be louder, Brandon. 
Please.

“But he’s coming out of it. 

Those stadiums are very loud, 
and there’s a lot of people in 
them. But he elevated his game 
over the spring.”

Fall camp begins next Monday, 

and 
Harbaugh 
anticipates 

it’ll take one to two weeks to 
resolve the competition between 
Speight, Peters and O’Korn.

“(It’ll) probably take about 

anywhere 
from 
eight 
to 
15 

practices to figure that out,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Historically 

that’s what it usually takes. But 
we’re looking forward to it. 
Mostly in a good spot.”

Bitter ending to last year 
lingers for Wolverines

FOOTBALL

CHICAGO — To say the end 

of last season was bitter for Jim 
Harbaugh and the Michigan 
football 
team 
would 
be 
an 

understatement.

Through 
the 
first 
nine 

games, the Wolverines were 
undefeated 
and 

ranked 
second 

in 
the 
nation, 

poised to make 
an 
appearance 

in the playoffs in 
just 
Harbaugh’s 

second year. That, 
after all, was the 
expectation 
for 

a 
senior-laden 

team that ended 
the previous year 
with a 41-7 thrashing of Florida.

Everything, it seemed, was 

going according to plan. And 
then it all fell apart.

Michigan lost three of its 

last four games, most painful of 
which was against their biggest 
rival.

A playoff bid that had once 

been in plain sight quickly 
disappeared as the Wolverines 
coughed up a late lead on the 
road against Ohio State.

That final, devastating stretch 

has lingered throughout the 
offseason. A trip to Rome — 
which Harbaugh 
said was the best 
thing 
he’s 
ever 

done as part of a 
football team — 
didn’t mask the 
stink of last year’s 
finish, either. 

“I 
hope 
(it’s 

driven this team) 
a lot,” Harbaugh 
said Tuesday at 
Big 
Ten 
Media 

Day. “I know it has a lot of us. 
Myself included. Lost three out 
of the last four games. Okay, 
good. Maybe that will motivate 
us to put more into it. Coach 
better. Play better. Train harder. 
Put more of our heart into each 
and every one of those ball 
games.”

Michigan breaks for camp 

next Monday with a drastically 
different team in place. Gone are 

the All-Americans and award 
winners of yesteryear. Their 
replacements will be youthful 
and inexperienced.

Rome wasn’t built in a day 

and neither is a championship-
winning football team. But that’s 
the expectation and goal that 
Michigan has entering this year, 
and it doesn’t have to look far 

to find a team to 
emulate.

Ohio 
State 

began last season 
as the youngest 
team 
in 
all 
of 

college 
football. 

Michigan 
will 

follow suit this 
fall, and if the 
Wolverines 
hope to have the 
same 
success 

the Buckeyes did last year, 
they’ll need their younger guys 
to step up. The talent is there, 
considering Michigan signed two 
consecutive top-five recruiting 
classes. It’ll be up to the staff to 
coax it out and avoid too many 
growing pains along the way.

“I feel good about the team,” 

Harbaugh said. “To start with, 
our second-newest guys, which 
is our freshmen that came at the 
mid-year, the ten that have really 
flourished and did exceedingly 
good in spring practice, and 
which makes me think that 

the newest guys 
that 
arrived 

on 
campus, 
19 

true 
incoming 

freshmen, 
because the ten 
did so well I think 
these 19 are going 
to do just as well 
because they were 
the same type of 
good players in 
high school that 

the 10 were.”

But Harbaugh’s considerable 

excitement about his freshman 
class may even be trumped by his 
hopes for his sophomores, many 
of whom saw the field last year.

“And then the third newest, 

the freshmen that are going to be 
sophomores this year, I’m very 
excited for them,” Harbaugh 
said. “... All the youngsters in

then it fell apart.

“Put more of

every one of 
those games.”

that class, very excited about 

them because everything they’re 
doing now they’ve already done, 
they’re doing for a second time.

“And 
the 

amount of growth 
that 
you 
can 

have from doing 
something 
for 

the 
first 
time 

and then doing 
it the next time 
or 
the 
second 

time, can be the 
biggest leap they 
have their entire 
college 
year, 

going from freshman year to 
sophomore year. Excited for 
that class.”

The foundation of the team, 

though, will still be built on 
Harbaugh’s fourth and fifth-
year players — players such 
as Chase Winovich, Maurice 
Hurst, Wilton Speight, Mike 
McCray, Bryan Mone and Mason 
Cole, all of whom experienced 
the many highs and lows of last 

season.

And 
they, 
like 
Harbaugh, 

still have a bitter taste in their 
mouths from last year’s ending.

“... Those guys in particular 

that were in games last year, 
they 
were 
there 
when 
we 

won nine straight games and 

everybody 
is 

high-fiving 
in 

the locker room 
after the game,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 

“And they were 
also there when 
we lost three out 
of our last four 
games, 
two 
by 

one 
point 
and 

another 
game 

by three points 

in overtime. They know what 
it feels like. And they like the 
feeling of the high-fiving better 
than the other.

“And I feel like, okay, good. 

They’ve seen that. And maybe 
that’s going to motivate them 
even more this year, give them 
more reason to put all their 
talent and pour their whole 
heart 
into 
everything 
that 

they’re doing.”

Defensive end Rashan Gary (3) is expected to make a big impact on Michigan’s defensive line this season.

Gary, Hurst look to handle the hype

CHICAGO — The Michigan 

football team featured a fearsome 
defensive line last season that racked 
up 30 sacks and helped to anchor one 
of the nation’s top defenses.

Much of that production is gone 

to the NFL this year. Chris Wormley, 
Ryan Glasgow and Taco Charlton 
— three of the four starters — were 
drafted this past spring, while Matt 
Godin, who started 12 games at 
three-technique defensive tackle, 
graduated.

The Wolverines, though, bring 

back several contributors — chief 
among them sophomore end Rashan 
Gary and fifth-year senior tackle 
Maurice Hurst.

Gary, formerly the nation’s top 

recruit, is expected to step into 
Wormley’s 
ANCHOR 
spot 
and 

Hurst is assumed to be the starter 
at Godin’s position. Both saw 
significant playing time last season, 
with Gary tallying 23 tackles, five 
tackles-for-loss and 0.5 sacks as a 
backup. Hurst posted 33 tackles, 11.5 
tackles-for-loss and five sacks while 
splitting time — oftentimes receiving 
the majority of snaps — with Godin.

Gary has much fewer counting 

stats compared to his counterpart. 
Despite that, he was named one 
of college football’s top “freaks” 

while also landing ahead of Hurst 
on Sports Illustrated’s list of the 
nation’s top-100 players, coming in 
at No. 22 — 49 spots ahead of Hurst.

The Gary hype train, it would 

appear, has been on the road for 
quite some time. His coach, though, 
thinks that the sophomore has done 
a good job of dealing with all of the 
attention.

“He’s had a lot of hype. He’s had a 

lot of adulation. And 
there’s some people 
that 
that’s 
what 

they live for. They 
live for approval 
of others and to 
be recognized as a 
hyped-up 
player,” 

Harbaugh 
said. 

“And then there’s 
other people that 
they see that hype 
or that adulation 
and they go by it 
like it’s an orange cone on the side of 
the road. There’s some people that 
are just aspiring for greater things 
than just the adulation of somebody. 
And I think Rashan is that type of 
guy. You’d really like him. He really 
doesn’t care too much about that.

“He’s gone by it like it’s a cone, 

orange cone on the side of the road. 
And he just works and I really think 
competing is his favorite thing to do. 
And he has the ability to be great. I 

don’t know what more to say about 
that.”

Harbaugh 
fielded 
a 
similar 

question about Hurst, and according 
to him, the fifth-year senior has done 
just as well. Both, in Harbaugh’s 
eyes, have the potential to be great 
players — and in that process, may 
help Michigan forget who it lost 
along the defensive line from last 
year.

“I 
think 
Mo 

has 
handled 
it 

good. I think it’s 
been overdue. And 
maybe Mo feels that 
way. But I think 
he’s enjoying that,” 
Harbaugh said. “I 
think he’s enjoying 
that 
people 
are 

appreciating 
what 

he does as a football 
player 
and 
what 

he brings to the 

football team, even on our own team.

“Our appreciation for him is 

probably the first, and I think he 
likes that. And I think that drives 
him to be even better. I think he’s 
got a chance to be really good, again. 
He’s got the license and the ability to 
be really great. And we appreciate 
the heck out of him. And I hope he 
does like that. I hope he keeps going, 
because he’s got a chance to be really 
good.”

The pair of defensive linemen could be in line for breakthrough 
seasons as they lead a unit that graduated four senior starters
