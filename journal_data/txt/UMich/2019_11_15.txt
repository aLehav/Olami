Students 
have 
a 
love-
hate relationship with their 
Michigan 
Marriage 
Pact 
matches. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
questionnaire, 
which 
was 
developed by University of 
Michigan students for a class 

project, were released Tuesday 
evening. The pact used an 
algorithm 
to 
find 
students 
their future spouse, and the 
match-ups generated a flurry 
of discussion on campus and 
online groups.
After 
being 
open 
to 
undergraduate 
students 
at 
the University for 21 days, 
the questionnaire closed last 

week with more than 7,000 
participants, 
meaning 
more 
than one out of every five 
undergraduates 
completed 
the survey. LSA junior Elien 
Michielssen, one of the creators 
of the pact, said her team never 
thought 
their 
class 
project 
would gain this much traction 
among students.
“Hearing people talk about 

something that you created 
without 
knowing 
that 
you 
created 
it 
is 
really, 
really 
cool,” Michielssen said. “If 
you haven’t taken it, you know 
someone who’s taken it, or 
you log into Facebook and 
see all the memes, so I think 
it’s something that’s brought 
campus together.”

Four student veterans 
from the University of 
Michigan 
spoke 
to 
a 
crowd of 20 people at 
the 
Michigan 
League 
Thursday morning. 
The 
event 
was 
sponsored by the Office 
of Veterans Affairs and 
moderated 
by 
Philip 
Larson, 
the 
program 
director of Veterans and 
Military 
Services, 
for 
Veterans Week sponsored 
by the University. The 
event 
consisted 
of 
a 
discussion with Larson 
followed by a Q&A with 
the audience. 
Larson 
started 
off 
the 
conversation 
by 
introducing the panelists 
and 
asking 
them 
how 
the military helped them 
prepare for college life. All 
of the panelists discussed 
how the military helped 
them 
learn 
skills 
for 
collegiate success. 
Panelist 
Jennifer 
Phillips, an LSA freshman, 
is part of the National 
Guard. She participated 

in basic training this past 
summer before starting 
her classes. Phillips shared 
that doing basic training 
for the National Guard 
made her more mature 
and made her stand out 
among her classmates. 
“Being a freshman and 
18 years old along with 
all the other freshmen 
here, I’m in the same age 
group 
and 
everything, 
but all of my professors 
have talked to me outside 
of class and asked, ‘How 
are you so different?’” 
Phillips said. “And that’s 
kind of when I told them 
like, ‘Oh yeah I’m in the 
army, this summer I went 
to basic training, and I 
really matured there, and 
I kind of realized what’s 
important.’”
Panelist Scott Reel, a 
Rackham student, served 
in the Marine Corps as 
a journalist and had to 
interact with all ranks 
of military officers. Reel 
said he became skilled 
in 
communicating 
and 
working with a deadline 
through his work.

Public Policy junior Ben 
Gerstein, 
Central 
Student 
Government 
president, 
wrote a letter to members 
of Michigan’s congressional 
delegation 
in 
support 
of 
the Higher Education Act, 
which seeks to make college 
tuition more affordable for 
students. In the letter, Gerstein 
stated that his constituents 
— 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students — are almost all in 
agreement regarding college 
affordability.
“While 
representing 
the 
various 
viewpoints 
of 
my 
constituents is a tempestuous 
endeavor, 
there 
is 
one 
issue where there is nearly 
unanimous 
consensus; 
the 
paramount saliency of college 
affordability,” Gerstein wrote 
in his letter.
Advocating for the students 
on both the state and federal 
levels was one of the priorities 
that Gerstein laid out at the 
beginning of his term. 
In his letter, Gerstein wrote 
in support of the provisions 

of the bill that seek to create 
tuition-free 
community 
college, increase Pell Grants 
and 
allow 
undocumented 
students access to federal aid. 
In his conclusion, Gerstein 
wrote that on behalf of the 
students of the University of 
Michigan-Ann Arbor, he looks 
forward to their support on the 
Higher Education Act and the 
College Affordability Act.
Some students are in favor 
of 
Gerstein’s 
lobbying 
of 
the 
federal 
representatives. 
LSA junior David Carpenter 
was supportive of Gerstein’s 
letter and applauded CSG for 
addressing the issue.
“Regardless of where you 
come from, regardless or not 
if you’re the individual that’s 
putting up the cost and in 
fellows education, it really 
does affect every single student 
that goes to the University of 
Michigan, and all the students 
that want to maybe want to 
come to the University of 
Michigan but are restricted by 
costs or by having to work and 
or other things,” Carpenter 
said.

Angie 
and 
Dan 
Bastian, 
husband and wife co-founders 
of kettle corn snack company 
BOOMCHICKAPOP, 
delivered 
the keynote speech to students 
and 
faculty 
in 
Robertson 

Auditorium at the 2019 Michigan 
Marketing 
Symposium 
on 
Thursday. The talk, moderated by 
Business lecturer Marcus Collins, 
focused on how the company 
disrupted the snack industry to 
fit with the symposium’s overall 
theme of disruption. 
BOOMCHICKAPOP 
started 
in 
the 
Bastians’s 
Mankato, 

Minnesota, garage in 2001 to 
pop kettle corn for carnivals, 
local markets and events. The 
company was acquired in 2017 by 
Conagra Foods for $250 million. 
The couple began popping kettle 
corn to build a college fund for 
their two daughters, then 3 and 5 
years old.
“We were trying to figure out 

if there was a solution to creating 
a college fund for our kids outside 
of what we were doing,” Dan 
Bastian said. “It was an $8,000 
investment, you got a kettle, you 
got a tent. So, we set it up outside, 
turned on the kettle and started 
schlepping the corn.”

Michael Breen, president 
and CEO of Human Rights 
First, spoke at the Ford School 
of Public Policy Thursday as 
part of a series of lectures 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Josh 
Rosenthal 
Education 
Fund. 
Breen discussed violations of 
human rights across the world 
and 
the 
challenges 
facing 
advocates.
The fund was established 
in honor of Josh Rosenthal, 
who died on Sept. 11, 2001, by 
his mother, a long-time faculty 
member at the University of 
Michigan. She aimed to bring 
insightful discussion around 
the aftermath of 9/11 and its 
consequences on human rights. 
Breen 
shared 
personal 
narratives 
about 
his 
own 
experience as a U.S. Army 
officer serving in Iraq post-
9/11. During his service, he was 
responsible for detaining Iraqi 

bomb makers. Breen said he sat 
down with their families prior 
to arresting their loved ones. 
“I remember saying, ‘We 
are different from the soldiers 
who might’ve been here six 
months ago under the previous 
regime,’” Breen said. “We’re 
Americans, we don’t torture 
people.” 
After 
he 
learned 
about 
Americans torturing detainees 
at the Abu Ghraib prison in 
Iraq, he decided to leave the 
military, enroll in law school 
and tackle refugee and human 
rights 
issues 
head-on. 
He 
became involved in Human 
Rights First, an organization 
that had support from the most 
senior-form military leaders 
who stood against torture. 
He explained the United 
States played a prominent role 
in the human rights movement 
post-Cold War and World War 
II. The United States became 
a pioneer for human rights, as 
well as a national example for 

other democracies to follow 
and activists to rely on for 
support.
“The degree of freedom, 
the 
upwards 
trajectory, 
hard-fought as it was, made 
it reasonable for the human 
rights movement to champion 
American leadership and wise 
for it to leverage it on behalf of 
human rights activists in other 
countries,” Breen said.
The 
United 
States 
was 
able to use its human rights 
initiatives 
to 
differentiate 
itself from the Soviet Union 
and other world leaders during 
times of political strife and 
decolonization, according to 
Breen. 
“In the context of the 
Cold War, it was clear that 
championing 
human 
rights 
was both the right thing and 
the smart thing to do — an 
ethical as well as a strategic 
imperative,” Breen said. 
Breen 
referenced 
the 
Helsinki Accords — a pivotal 
human 
rights 
pact 
signed in the 1970s — as 
a document that fought 
against suppression and 
coercion 
and 
protected 
notions of human rights 
to promote peace around 
the world. He also noted, 
though, that the end of the 
Cold War did not translate 
to the progress of human 
rights that was envisioned. 
“Many forces and tools 
that 
we 
once 
believed 
would inevitably favor the 
advancement 
of 
human 
rights turned out to be 
double-edged 
swords,” 
Breen said. “It was widely 
believed, for example, that 
economic growth would 
lead 
to 
democratization 
and a call for more rights. 
The reality, unfortunately, 
is that some autocrats have 
succeeded in linking their 
rule to economic gains and 
security.”
Breen used China as an 
example of a government 
that 
has 
succeeded 
in 
convincing its people that 

economic growth relies on the 
health of the Communist Party 
and its rule and that democratic 
ideals would threaten that 
growth. He went on to note 
authoritarians 
around 
the 
world have been pointing to the 
failures of liberal democracies 
to strengthen the credibility of 
their own regimes. Moreover, 
he said the claim the United 
States is the leading example 
of 
a 
human 
rights-driven 
democracy can no longer be 
supported. 
“The United States began 
the century as a respected and 
unrivaled military, economic, 
political and, in many ways, 
moral power,” Breen said. “But 
consider America’s record in 
the eyes of the world since 
the turn of the century: illegal 
torture and black sites in the 
wake of 9/11, the 2003 invasion 
of Iraq, the 2008 financial crisis 
and the subsequent recession 
that followed, the 2016 election 
and the continuing awfulness 
of our politics.”
Breen claimed the Trump 
administration is worsening 
the human rights crisis in 
the United States by allowing 
for multiple human rights 
violations, specifically against 
immigrants and refugees. He 
said that as a consequence, 
activists in other countries 
are no longer using American 
values in defense of their 
protests and are instead having 
to appeal to localized rhetoric 
and goals. 
“Today, we have arguably 
the first administration since 
the Second World War to stand 
in open opposition to human 
rights,” Breen said. “Human 
rights, the concept, the system, 
the universal language and its 
greatest traditional champion, 
the United States, holds less 
promise for activists who are 
coming up for strategies for 
their movements today than it 
did 10 years ago.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
This is the first day of what will be a months-long process, where 
there will inevitably be a compromise made on every side. If we, the 
graduate employees and the GEO members at the University of 
Michigan, continue to show up every step of the way to show support 
for our team, for our platform and for our union, the University will hear 
us. We get what we are organized to take.”

Emily Gauld, Rackham student and president of the Graduate Employees’ Organization

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look at 
one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA senior Max Marcovitch, 
reported on Michigan football player Cameron McGrone’s 
relationship with his younger brother Aaron.

“Cameron’s a 20-year-old guy, I’m a 21-year-old guy, and it’s just humanizing 

to be able to hear about his life and his upbringing. It’s also very heartwarming 

to be able to hear about his relationship with his brother and to see how that’s 

shaped him, as a person rather than as a football player.”

Michael Breen discusses role of advocates across the world, obstacles 

VALENTINA HOUSE
For The Daily 


The 
Bastians 
sold 
kettle corn at local events 
and markets but made a 
breakthrough 
when 
they 
started selling at Minnesota 
Vikings trainings. 
“They loved it enough that 
the sales and marketing team 
came over the next day and 
offered as a contract to be the 
kettle corn of the Vikings, 
with the caveat that it costs a 
grand,” Dan Bastian said. “We 
were excited that we could 
make some inroads, realizing 
that if we got connected with 
the Vikings that will help 
build our outreach to other 
potential customers. … We 
would pop right outside the 
stadium … and have lines of 
people. And that’s when things 
kind of started to change for 
us.”
While moving into retail, 
the Bastians found a space for a 
popcorn targeting women. The 
brand focuses on using clean 
ingredients and empowering 
female 
consumers, 
aiming 
to encourage them to have 
a positive relationship with 
food. 
“We went in 2004 and we 
looked at what was popcorn 
called,” Angie Bastian said. 
“At the time on grocery store 
shelves popcorn was Vick’s, 
Orville, Dale and Thomas, 
Harry and David, Cracker 
Jack. This is my punch line. 
I said every time, I said to 
Dan, ‘Where are the popcorn-
women on the shelf?’ So, we 
named it Angie’s, created a 
small label and started out 
with just a plain cellophane 
bag with a label on it and 
started to sell in stores.” 
Angie said she felt the 
company 
truly 
disrupted 
the popcorn and snacking 
industry 
when 
it 
began 
working with salespeople and 
marketers to target female 
consumers. 
While 
snacks 
targeting men were permissive 
and those marketed toward 
children 
and 
adolescents 
were playful, Angie Bastian 

said snacks targeting women 
assumed they were on diets 
— a marketing technique she 
wanted to avoid. 
“Our sales team said, ‘Why 
don’t we just do it?’ ‘Angie’s 
Nearly 
Naked’ 
or 
‘Angie’s 
Skinny’ or something like 
that, because that’s what was 
happening in the marketplace 
at the time,” Angie Bastian 
said. “I’ll just say at that point 
there were 72 trademarks for 
food with the word ‘skinny.’ 
And I just said, ‘You know 
what? I don’t want to do that, 
like, we are not going to do 
that.’”

In the wider food industry, 
Angie 
Bastian 
added, 
advertising 
and 
marketing 
toward 
women 
is 
either 
hypersexualized or focused 
on dieting. Her goal was to 
remove the barrier between 
women and snacking built up 
by marketers. 
“Women and food were 
depicted in a couple of ways, 
and one of those ways was a 
‘moment of conflict,’” Angie 
Bastian said. “If a woman is 
going to eat, it’s conflictual 
for her, or it’s sexualized for 
her, and we are not like this. 
This is going to be food for 
women every day: normal, 
natural.”
Business graduate student 
Georgia 
Cassady, 
one 
of 
the vice presidents of the 
Marketing Symposium, said 
her team wanted to focus 
on finding a disruptor in the 
consumer-packaged 
goods 

industry. The Business school 
emphasizes 
the 
Consumer 
Packaged 
Goods 
industry 
for 
marketing 
recruiting, 
she said, but the industry 
is sometimes perceived as 
stagnant and slow-moving. 
“A lot of people think it’s an 
industry that’s just chugging 
along,” Cassady said. “Tech is 
the big thing these days, but 
we wanted to remind people 
that 
there’s 
opportunity 
for change and disruption 
within CPG and all types of 
marketing, regardless of the 
industry you’re going into. 
… Since we’re all going to be 
managers after our MBAs, 
how can you continue to 
disrupt and challenge the 
status quo?” 
Cassady said the Bastians 
were 
able 
to 
disrupt 
a 
seemingly stagnant industry 
like snacking while providing 
an empowering brand for 
women. 
“Right 
when 
you 
think 
that snacking, and especially 
popcorn, 
that 
there’s 
not 
much more you can do, that 
there’s so many people in the 
industry, these people came in 
with a brand that was entirely 
new,” Cassady said. “One of 
the big things was that Orville 
Redenbacher, SmartPop, they 
were all kind of masculine. So, 
they came in with this really 
feminine brand and that was 
really different.” 
Dan 
Bastian 
said 
BOOMCHICKAPOP’s 
early 
success 
came 
from 
long 
hours of work and dedication 
to the brand, along with 
fast adaptation to obstacles 
they faced entering the CPG 
industry. 
“I think so many people 
get stuck on needing to nail 
it, perfect it,” Dan Bastian 
said. “For us, just continuing 
to move forward was what 
worked for us. Our success 
lies oftentimes in the fact that 
we move fast. We didn’t take 
shortcuts, but we would adjust 
on the fly, and if we made 
mistakes or had challenges, 
we would revisit and fix it and 
keep moving forward.”

Michielssen 
and 
her 
team 
created 
the 
project 
for 
an 
entrepreneurial creativity course 
taught by University lecturer Eric 
Fretz. He said his assignment had 
no set guidelines other than it 
must be “cool,” take all semester to 
complete and must change people’s 
lives in some way. In the past, he 
has received final products ranging 
from a concert at Necto Nightclub to 
a robot that takes the trash out.
Fretz said he isn’t surprised the 
pact has gone “viral” on campus — 
he’s heard other faculty members 
discussing the pact, though he is 
not surprised it has gone “viral” 
on campus. He said he has also 
had friends with backgrounds in 
computer science reach out with 
interest in the project, often offering 
insight into the security of the 
website.
Fretz said he expected the 
questionnaire to either end up 
with 200-500 participants or break 
5,000, but once it started spreading 
around campus, Fretz knew it 
wouldn’t stop.
“Once it becomes a thing, 
everybody talks about it, and then 
everybody wants to do it,” Fretz 
said. “That was that hump I knew 
they would have to get over, but 
I figured it would happen pretty 
quickly.”
Michielssen 
and 
her 
group 
have watched their creation turn 
into the talk of campus over the 
last three weeks. Since the results 
came out, private Facebook pages 
where students post about U-M 
campus life, like UMich Memes 
for Wolverteens and Overheard at 
umich, have been inundated with 
content about the pact.
One poster made a poll to see if 
people participated and, if they did, 
how they felt about their match. 
Another created a meme about 
being a senior matched with a 
freshman.
For Michielssen, logging onto 
social media means seeing a barrage 
of posts about her team’s creation, 
which she said she finds hilarious. 
However, not all participants 
were excited about their results. 
Several heterosexual participants 
reported being matched with people 

who identify as the same gender, as 
well as people being matched with 
their siblings or cousins.
LSA sophomore Natalie White, 
who found the pact through her 
roommates, said she felt swept 
up in the excitement of the mass 
engagement across. Because all of 
her roommates were filling it out, 
she decided to as well, but her match 
was not what she was expecting.
White identifies as a heterosexual 
woman, meaning she would be 
interested in matching only with 
heterosexual men, yet her match 
was also a woman. She reached out 
to the email the results were sent 
from and was told someone must 
have inserted the wrong gender 
or sexual orientation, which made 
White question if she had completed 
the questionnaire incorrectly.
“We all got our matches, and I 
went to look, and I was matched to 
someone named Rachel, and I was 
like, ‘Okay, that’s not usually a guy’s 
name,’” White said. “I was pretty 
sure it was a girl, so I looked her 
up on Instagram and it was a girl. 
… I don’t know if I screwed up and 
she was actually looking for girls, 
because I feel like maybe I deprived 
someone of finding their Michigan 
lover.”
Michielssen 
said 
her 
team 
received emails similar to the 
one White sent and immediately 
checked the algorithm. She said 
they found no errors and concluded 
that people either completed the 
questionnaire 
for 
their 
friend 
and entered the wrong sexual 
orientation as a joke, or people could 
have simply clicked the wrong 
option by mistake.
She noted the algorithm used 
MCommunity, an online resource 
for finding contact information 
for members of the University 
community, to verify participants 
were undergraduate students. She 
said this worked for most cases, but 
in some circumstances, they were 
unable to verify their grade level.
Additionally, 
Michielssen 
said approximately 8 percent of 
participants were not matched, 
the 
majority 
of 
which 
were 
heterosexual female students.
Public Health junior Renata 
Terrazzan was one of the female 
students who did not get matched. 
When the creators sent out an email 
to all participants early on in the 

process noting many heterosexual 
women might not get a match, 
Terrazzan said she had a feeling she 
might fall into that category.
“When I first got the email about 
700 girls (not being matched), I was 
like, ‘Oh, of course it will be me,’” 
Terrazzan said. “Then it was, and I 
just thought it was kind of tea and a 
good story.”
Michielssen 
attributed 
this 
mainly to an imbalance in the 
number of heterosexual male and 
female participants. She also noted 
the purpose of the questionnaire is 
to find potential future spouses for 
participants, so if a large number 
of students of a particular gender 
and sexual orientation were not in 
the participant pool, it would make 
sense for there to be no match.
While she wanted everyone to 
find someone through the pact, 
Michielssen cautioned participants 
not to take the results to heart. She 
reminded people the questionnaire 
is for a back-up person to marry in 
20 years, not to be the participant’s 
next significant other.
“I really want to remind people 
that this is a marriage pact, and it’s 
not meant to be taken too seriously,” 
Michielssen said. “In no way, shape 
or form are we trying to set people 
up right now. Our whole goal of 
this was if you’re single in 20 years, 
and you’re lonely, well, this is your 
person.”
She said her team hopes to do 
a similar questionnaire next year, 
though they still have to work out 
the logistics as two team members 
are graduating. For Michielssen, 
this has become almost like a part-
time job, with her team putting 
in multiple hours each day on the 
questionnaire since the beginning 
of the semester.
As for the team’s grade on the 
project, the jury is still out. The 
project lasts until the end of the 
semester, so right now Michielssen 
and her partners are working on 
responding to any issues people 
run into, gathering feedback from 
participants 
and 
preparing 
a 
presentation.
When all is said and done, 
Michielssen said she is hoping they 
get an A.
“I hope all of campus is crossing 
their fingers for us,” Michelssen 
said.

“Being 
a 
journalist, 
there’s kind of a pipeline 
for work. You have to 
contact 
the 
units, 
and 
then you have to figure it 
out,” Reel said. “You have 
to film it, and you have to 
write it. You have to, if 
you’re doing video editing, 
do 
basically 
everything 
yourself. There’s a deadline 
because this is journalism, 
so I got pretty good at 
prioritizing projects and 
task management.” 
Panelist 
and 
nursing 
student 
Warren 
DeLong 
went 
straight 
into 
the 
Navy 
after 
high 
school 
and served in a hospital 
in 
Okinawa, 
Japan. 
He 
said being in a foreign 
country without his family 
at 19 years old helped him 
develop as a person. 
“My first duty station was 
Naval Hospital in Okinawa, 
Japan, and I loved it,” 
DeLong said. “When you’re 
living in a foreign country, 
as a 19-year-old, it’s not 
hard to find fun, new, 
exciting things. I really 
liked the people I worked 
with … and they guided me, 
they mentored me, and they 
got me on the path that I 
am today started taking 
college classes.” 
Engineering 
graduate 
student Ian Carter attended 
the event and told The 
Daily that discussing the 
different types of military 
careers 
emphasized 
the 
diverse opportunities the 
military offers.
“My favorite thing is 
that they all had different 
experiences, and I think 
that 
is 
important 
to 
highlight when you are 
talking about people in the 
military,” Carter said. “You 
can have a Marine that was 
a journalist and you can 
have a Navy corpsman that 
was working in a hospital. 
The variety of stories really 
help to highlight to regular 
civilians that the military 
is really a profession and 

that you can accomplish 
other things.”
During the discussion, 
panelists 
also 
talked 
about 
adjusting 
to 
University 
housing 
on 
campus. 
Engineering 
student Stefany Escobedo, 
panelist and president of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
Student 
Veterans 
of 
America, said she had to do 
her own research to find out 
whether she was eligible 
for graduate housing. 
“I did not know because 
I was so old, that I could 
be in graduate housing as 
an undergraduate. And it 
took — it was the first year 
— after the first year, year 
and a half maybe, that I 
was reading through the 
policies and procedures of 
housing for some reason,” 
Escobedo said. “And that’s 
when I saw if you’re out of 
high school for six years 
or something, then you 
can 
apply 
for 
graduate 
housing. And I said, ‘Why 
did nobody tell me?’ That 
was very frustrating for me 
because instead of moving 
around 
from, 
like, 
this 
little room and my summer 
storage to this apartment 
that cost $1,400 and that 
was really far away from 
North Campus.”
Business 
sophomore 
Michael Geraci attended 
the event and told The 
Daily it was helpful to 
hear positive and negative 
perspectives of being in the 
military. 
“I 
thought 
it 
was 
interesting to get insight 
from enlisted and active 
duty people,” Geraci said. 
“I’m not contracted with 
ROTC (Reserve Officers’ 
Training 
Corps) 
yet, 
which means I don’t have 
a commitment with it. I’m 
still kind of considering 
that 
option, 
and 
I’m 
considering what route I 
would want to do. I also 
like hearing the negatives, 
too. You get the positives 
shoved down your throat, 
and I wanted to get a whole 
perspective.” 

Other students, like Public 
Policy 
senior 
Nicholas 
Tomaino, urged CSG to ensure 
they were surveying all groups 
on campus to get an accurate 
read of the political dynamics 
on campus. 
“The University of Michigan 
is 
a 
premier 
research 
university in the state of 
Michigan, and obviously it’s 
important to have some sort of 
relationship with our elected 
representatives,” 
Tomino 
said. “It’s a respectable thing 
to be doing. It’s incumbent on 
the CSG president to seek out 
the perspectives of various 
communities across campus 
whenever he/she aspires to 
speak on behalf of the entire 
student body.”

Tomaino 
said 
Gerstein’s 
statement 
should 
have 
specified whether students on 
campus unanimously agreed 
that the Higher Education Act 
was the best solution to solve 
the college affordability crisis.
“While I’m sure that there 
is near-unanimous consensus 
that college affordability is an 
important issue for folks on 
campus, I’m largely skeptical 
that there is near-unanimous 
consensus 
on 
the 
Higher 
Education Act being the most 
effective method for solving 
it,” Tomaino said.
Gernstein 
said 
in 
his 
conversations 
with 
student 
stakeholders at the University, 
the 
dialogue 
was 
largely 
centered on improving campus 
affordability. He said there 
wasn’t a specific survey on how 
the entire student population 
felt. 

“I would say that among 
the 40,000 students we have 
on campus, a good majority, 
a large amount of students 
would say at least the campus 
affordability is an issue that 
exists here at the University 
of Michigan and in higher 
education across the country,” 
Gernstein. “And so, I didn’t 
have specific polling numbers 
to show that the entire student 
population 
thinks 
campus 
affordability is a large or larger 
issue, but just in terms of 
campus advocacy, and what the 
dialogue has been on campus 
around campus affordability 
the last couple of years and 
institutional barriers to access 
for low socioeconomic status 
students.” 
Communications 
director 
of the University’s chapter of 
College 
Democrats 
Camille 
Mancuso, Public Policy junior, 

commended CSG’s support of 
the Higher Education Act.
“College 
inaccessibility 
and unaffordability is a crisis 
faced by students all across 
the country, and that crisis is 
amplified at the University of 
Michigan. College Democrats 
is excited to see a commitment 
to solving this crisis in our 
Central Student Government,” 
Mancuso wrote. “The Higher 
Education Act is a step toward 
increasing college access for all 
students--specifically for low-
income 
and 
undocumented 
students. It is both important 
and necessary that our Central 
Student Government President 
reflect the interests of students 
by advocating for the Higher 
Education Act.”
The Daily reached out to 
the College Republicans for 
comment several times but 
received no response.

The impending nightmare of Medicare-For-All

Tea parties and tampons

Y

ou’ve probably heard of 
the Affordable Care Act, 
a 
legislative 
measure 
signed by former President Barack 
Obama that sought to address 
some of the underlying issues in 
our national health care system. 
Now, however, Democrats are 
overwhelmingly 
supporting 
“Medicare-for-All,” a dramatic 
replacement 
of 
the 
already-
controversial 
“Obamacare” 
program that would effectively 
move all control of health care to 
the federal government.
Health care in our nation 
undoubtedly needs some fine-
tuning. In a December 2017 
survey, Gallup found that 71 
percent of Americans believe our 
system “is in a state of crisis” or 
“has major problems.” Though 
the situation has improved in 
recent years, tens of millions 
of people remain uninsured, 
while households continue to 
be plagued by rising health care 
costs.
Supporters of this proposal 
widely argue its ability to bring 
coverage 
to 
all 
Americans 
(including 
those 
who 
have 
experienced 
difficulties 
with 
accessing care), reduce costs and 
improve public health across 
the board. And they seem to be 
winning over supporters, with 
some poll numbers revealing that 
70 percent of Americans support 
enacting the Medicare-for-All 
system.
But while Medicare-for-All 
is well-intentioned and aims 
to deliver a better health care 
system — especially for struggling 
Americans — its promises seem 
to exist more in fantasy than 
reality. I’d like to challenge this 
broad support and argue why 
such a model would wreak havoc 
on our economy and our lives.
A good place to start is the 
sheer 
cost 
of 
Medicare-for-
All. PBS NewsHour reported 
that under the plan outlined 
by 
Senator 
Bernie 
Sanders, 
I-Vt., the cost would near “$34 
trillion dollars over 10 years, 
more than the total cost of social 
security, medicare and medicaid 
combined.” With the United 
States already in the midst of a 
dangerous national debt crisis 
(our total deficit already stands 
at nearly $23 trillion), many 
puzzle over how our fiscally 
irresponsible government would 
be able to handle this hefty price 
tag. 
In addition, it’s clear this 
amount 
of 
money 
won’t 
materialize out of thin air. It 
is going to have to be covered 
somehow, and amid existing 
financial problems, many experts 
agree that our economy is going 
to suffer. According to Robert 
E. Moffit, senior fellow at the 
Heritage Foundation, substantial 
tax hikes under Medicare-for-
All are inevitable. “Taxpayers 
would face enormous burdens,” 
Moffit 
stated. 
“Roughly 
70 
percent of working households 
would pay more than they do 

today.” While advocates have 
assured the American people 
that most people will be saving 
money somehow, a Bloomberg 
article published in July advises 
readers to take a closer look. 
“The 181 million taxpayers with 
employer-sponsored 
coverage 
could miss out on the benefits of 
the Sanders plan, and even those 
receiving Medicaid could pay 
more,” according to writer Laura 
Davison. 
Ultimately, 
without 
substantial tax hikes (including 
on the middle-class), the bulky 
Medicare-for-All system won’t 
even be able to get off the ground. 
Even a 100-percent increase in 
federal individual and corporate 
income tax revenue would not 
be enough to pay for Sanders’s 
plan, as Charles Blahous, former 
member of the Medicare Board 
of Trustees, predicted. Blahous 
went on to conclude that this 
kind of increase in the scope 
of 
the 
federal 
government 
operations would precipitate a 
correspondingly large increase in 
federal taxation or debt and would 
be unprecedented if undertaken 
as an enduring commitment. 
More than anything else, rising 
taxes and expanding debt equals 

bad news for our economy.
And if this isn’t enough to sway 
your opinion, there’s even more 
evidence against the Medicare-
for-All model. With the idea 
gaining popularity, many health 
systems 
across 
the 
country 
continue to warn Americans that 
they will see dramatic reductions 
in the quality of their care. 
According to Lauren Crawford 
Shaver, executive director of the 
Partnership for America’s Health 
Care Future, “Medicare for all 
would force Americans to pay 
more and wait longer for lower-
quality health care” (Shaver notes 
a public option could potentially 
have this issue as well). We have 
already seen from other countries, 
such as Canada, that these single-
payer 
systems 
can 
produce 
greatly 
undesirable 
results. 
“Waiting 
for 
treatment 
has 
become a defining characteristic 
of Canadian health care,” as 
stated by the Fraser Institute in 
a December 2018 account of the 
issue. “Wait times can, and do, 
have serious consequences such 
as increased pain, suffering, 
and mental anguish … In many 
instances, patients may also have 
to forgo their wages while they 
wait for treatment, resulting in an 
economic cost to the individuals 

themselves and the economy 
in general.” While Sanders and 
others argue that access across 
the board to health care will 
widen, it is clear that there will be 
a significant underlying cost that 
we don’t hear about much. 
On top of this, all Americans, 
even those who are happy with 
their current health care plan 
from the private market, will be 
forced to switch to the single-
payer 
platform, 
something 
that will surely be a logistical 
nightmare and lead to extensive 
frustration. Single-payer health 
care 
advocate 
Rep. 
Pramila 
Jayapal, D-Wash., affirmed this, 
telling NBC News that Medicare-
for-All 
is 
“a 
system 
where 
there are no private insurance 
companies” whatsoever. 
Finally, if history is to serve 
as a guide, it tells us that central 
government control of large 
programs is a perfect recipe 
for 
substantial 
waste, 
fraud 
and abuse, and Medicare-for-
All will be no exception. One 
of the most glaring examples 
of this is the Veterans Health 
Administration, 
which 
takes 
after the single-payer model and 
truly displays the inability of our 
federal government to effectively 
manage large-scale programs. 
Furthermore, 
the 
current, 
smaller Medicare system has 
already seen significant abuse 
that officials have been unable to 
effectively deal with. 
Many people may wonder how 
a plan this absurd, with such 
evident flaws, could gain such 
prominence and make it this far, 
to the point that it is one of the 
centerpieces of the Democratic 
agenda. 
Ultimately, 
broad 
misunderstanding 
exists 
over 
the sheer price tag of Medicare-
for-All and who will have to bear 
the burden of this health care 
system. In the end, proponents 
of this system have routinely 
dodged facts, cut corners and 
disregarded the greater effect on 
the American people. 
Already, a number of more 
modest proposals have been 
floated, and while I do not 
personally 
support 
many 
of 
them, they offer some of the 
benefits 
of 
Medicare-for-All 
and are safer and truly better 
options for the American people. 
Many Democratic presidential 
candidates, including former Vice 
President Joe Biden and others, 
realize the inherent limitations 
of Medicare-for-All and have set 
forth more modest options that 
deserve serious consideration.
In the end, it is obvious that 
something needs to change. It 
is our duty, as Americans, to 
help our fellow citizens and 
work to deliver quality health 
care to those in need at a fair 
cost. But given our wide range 
of options, that duty assuredly 
does not entail implementing this 
disastrous proposal.

T

he first time I visited 
Boston was the summer 
before my junior year 
of high school, and I was far 
more interested in the city’s 
opportunities higher education 
than its history. However, my 
mother 
mandated 
one 
day 
must be spent on sightseeing 
rather than solely college visits. 
After walking the entirety of 
the city’s Freedom Trail — a 
2.5-mile walk that felt much 
longer — we went to a museum 
dedicated to the Boston Tea 
Party, commemorating Dec. 16, 
1773, the night alleged members 
of the Sons of Liberty destroyed 
an entire shipment of East India 
Company tea by throwing it 
into Boston Harbor in protest of 
taxation without representation. 
The visit included a cheesy 
re-enactment of the protest — my 
chance to throw a fake box of tea, 
attached to the ship by a rope, 
into the harbor while giggling 
and weakly shouting “Huzzah!” 
just like a real Founding Father. 
I wonder if the Sons of Liberty 
had any idea that nearly 250 years 
later, it wouldn’t be boxes of tea 
their nation’s daughters would 
want to throw into the harbor. It 
would be boxes of tampons.
Currently, 35 states — including 
Michigan — continue to classify 
tampons and other menstrual 
products as luxury goods. Unlike 
lip balm, anti-dandruff shampoo 
and even Viagra, tampons can still 
be taxed as non-essential items in 
most of the country. I am certain 
any person who menstruates 
can agree that tampons are not 
a luxury. The amount of money 
added to the purchase of a box 
of tampons by this tax may seem 
inconsequential, but over time 
that extra charge on already 
overpriced period products adds 
up. For example, Michigan’s 
6 percent sales tax raises the 
average price of $7 for a box of 
tampons an additional 42 cents. 
Consider that many people are 
buying multiple products, often 
for multiple people, and the 
unnecessary burden this tax is 
imposing on individuals becomes 
clear. For the many people in this 
country living on tight budgets, 

this tax can mean the choice 
between period products and 
medications, diapers or dinner 
for the week. It’s time to bring an 
end to this senseless and sexist 
tax in Michigan and throughout 
the country.
The Sons of Liberty certainly 
got their message across through 
their protest; unfortunately, they 
destroyed a whole lot of perfectly 
good tea in the process. Instead of 
protesting through destruction, 
let’s protest through support. 
Rather than throwing that box of 
tampons into the Huron River, we 
can demonstrate our dedication 
to ending period poverty by 
donating our extra tampons to 

a local women’s shelter or food 
bank. Through activism, we 
can empower ourselves and our 
fellow menstruators to bleed 
without shame. In fact, you don’t 
even have to menstruate to be 
a supporter of the tampon tax 
reform. We need men to be more 
than just comfortable talking 
about periods. They should be 
willing to fight for an end to 
period poverty. 
Around 
the 
world, 
this 
fight has already begun. Other 
countries, such as Canada and 
Australia, have abolished taxes 
on period products nationwide, 
starting 
an 
important 
trend 
that is also beginning to catch 
on in the United States. Several 
states have passed legislation 
ending the tampon tax, including 
Minnesota, Nevada and — the 
home of the fight against unfair 
taxation 
— 
Massachusetts. 
Unfortunately, it hasn’t been 
smooth sailing for the rest of the 

states, exemplified by the 22 bills 
introduced in state legislatures 
to repeal the tampon tax that 
ultimately 
were 
not 
signed 
into law. Here in Michigan, the 
journey 
has 
been 
especially 
rocky, with the bill to end the 
tampon tax becoming known as a 
“zombie” in the state legislature, 
returning session after session 
only to die on the floor, or even 
in committee, every time due to 
concerns about lost tax revenue. 
Michigan’s state legislature has 
seemingly 
demonstrated 
that 
reforming tampon tax and taking 
the first step toward menstrual 
equity isn’t worth the effort of 
rearranging the budget. We can 
change this attitude through 
action and advocacy. It’s time 
to steer a smoother course for 
tampon tax reform through 
political activism. Whether you 
hail from Michigan or one of the 
many states that still tax tampons, 
call your state representative and 
let them know you’re not just 
going to go with the flow when 
it comes to menstrual equality. 
It’s time for the rest of the nation 
to catch up to the international 
trend and bring an end to the 
taxation of menstrual products 
across the country.
A safe, healthy period is 
fundamental to wellness. Being 
unable to afford period products 
can significantly hinder one’s 
ability to thrive — nearly one in 
five girls in the United States miss 
school due to period poverty, 
and women in situations of 
homelessness and incarceration 
must face additional hardship 
due to menstrual inequality. Like 
access to nutritional food and 
clean water, access to feminine 
hygiene products is a basic human 
need. The tampons that many 
states deem non-essential goods 
are demonstrably and absolutely 
essential. Menstrual products are 
not a choice — they are a health 
care necessity. The removal of the 
tampon tax is an imperative first 
step on the path toward ending 
period poverty. No more taxation 
of menstruation. Huzzah! 

W

e 
drifted 
around 
campus, feeling the 
glares 
of 
college 
students rushing past us to 
class. Everyone was in awe at 
the overload of information 
that spouted out of our tour 
guide as we spun the cube and 
tiptoed over the block ‘M’ in 
the Diag. From the grandiose 
architecture to the towering 
trees, 
everything 
seemed 
special, even the legendary 
friendly squirrels. 
Now a junior, I still smile at 
the tiny, tree-dwelling rodents 
that 
seem 
to 
outnumber 
humans in Ann Arbor. On a 
daily basis, as I drive home to 
walk my dogs, I find myself 
slamming on my brakes as 
one of those fluffballs darts 
into the road. I haven’t killed 
one yet, but occasionally I’ll 
see a squirrel who wasn’t so 
lucky. Each dead squirrel is 
a sad reminder of Michigan’s 
disastrous roadkill problem.
I see it on my weekly drive 
to Ypsilanti to volunteer: the 
mangled corpses of almost a 
dozen animals in the span of 
a few miles. Skunks, possums, 
deer, coyotes, foxes, turtles, 
dogs, cats and every other road-
adjacent animal in Michigan, 
smeared onto the highway. 
It’s 
no 
surprise 
these 
busy 
highways 
are 
almost 
insurmountable obstacles for 
Michigan’s critters, with a 
cement median blocking them 
from reaching the other side 
and effectively trapping them 
on the road. In Ann Arbor, 
animal 
vehicle 
collisions 
have become so frequent that 
they’ve impacted a major local 
issue: the deer cull. 
This 
man-made 
issue, 
caused by the extermination 
of the deer’s predators like 
gray wolves, has caused the 
number of deer-vehicle crashes 
to rise 73 percent between 2015 
and 2016 and has pushed the 
government to hire professional 
sharpshooters to thin out the 
herd since 2016. They have 
killed hundreds of deer so far, 
but not without a fair amount 
of outcry from animal-loving 

citizens who point to the lack 
of crash fatalities as reason to 
call off the $370,000 program. 
Roadkill has become a major 
issue throughout the entire 
nation, costing $5.75 billion 
each 
year. 
The 
solutions, 
like 
wildlife 
crossings 
and 
preventive 
fencing, 
are 
relatively 
cheap 
compared 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
animal-
vehicle collisions, which cost 
Michiganders alone more than 
$130 million in 2018.

Unlike in the forest, where 
scavengers and decomposers 
eat the corpses, roadkill often 
rots on the road or is taken to 
a landfill. Without the other 
critters of the forest able to 
recycle the corpses’ nutrients 
into 
the 
ecosystem, 
the 
carbon dioxide stored in these 
organisms 
is 
released 
into 
the atmosphere, contributing 
to climate change. Without 
preventative measures in place, 
some folks have come up with 
their own unique and delicious 
way of alleviating the issue, 
opting out of the deli for the 
open road by choosing to eat 
roadkill.
While it may seem taboo, 
eating roadkill is legal in some 
form in 30 states, including 
Michigan. Michigan state law 
allows people to keep all forms 
of roadkill after undertaking 
the proper legal procedures. 
This allows venison and bear 
meat enthusiasts to use the 
hundreds of pounds of fresh, 
free-range 
meat 
that 
may 
happen to find itself strewn 
across their bumpers.

Environmentalists 
are 
in love with the idea. By 
consuming what would have 
otherwise gone on to harm 
the environment, this eating 
habit has the potential to be 
more environmentally friendly 
(and a lot easier) than even 
veganism. Advocates even call 
the animals’ cause of death 
“humane” in comparison to 
the horrific practices used to 
raise and slaughter most store-
bought meat. 
There’s already a thriving 
subculture based around eating 
a wide variety of roadkill. I 
was surprised by how good 
the 
recipes 
sounded, 
from 
fox lasagna to Pennsylvania 
possum pot pie and a dish 
featuring my friends in the 
Diag: squirrel in cream. Some 
communities have chosen to 
utilize this free and nutritious 
source of protein to help solve 
hunger in their communities.
In the parks of Denver this 
summer, thousands of geese 
were rounded up after extreme 
measures to depopulate them 
failed. 
About 
1,662 
were 
killed and donated to local 
food banks to feed the city’s 
homeless 
population. 
While 
this is perhaps a cruel example, 
it reflects the idea of feeding 
vulnerable populations with 
fresh, wild game while saving 
cities thousands of dollars on 
meat that would otherwise have 
been donated or purchased.
Programs 
using 
the 
country’s 
vast 
amounts 
of 
roadkill make financial and 
moral sense for communities 
with chronic deer problems like 
Ann Arbor. Instead of making 
these animals’ deaths mean 
nothing, perhaps they can be 
used to better our society and 
help those in need. A program 
similar to one already in place 
for the city’s culled deer could 
bring the community together 
over the smell of delicious 
venison 
stew 
rather 
than 
fracture it over the stench of 
rotting deer corpses.

Friday, November 15, 2019 — 5A

On Tuesday, Nov. 5, Wilco took to the stage 
at Hill Auditorium for a stop on their Ode 
to Joy tour, following a strong opening set 
by Deep Sea Diver (featuring a particularly 
enthusiastic and capable drummer). The 
opener “Bright Leaves” set the tone for most 
of the evening — relaxed and melancholy. 
Ode to Joy, while perhaps the strongest 
project Wilco has released since The Whole 
Love (2012), does not translate well to a 
live show. The album is fairly low-energy, 
more suited to background listening than 
to a concert performance. Most of the cuts 
from that album felt obligatory, given that 
the tour is nominally in support of it. Wilco 
played “Citizens” live for the first and, God 
willing, last time ever. Luckily, they included 
plenty of crowd-pleasing numbers off of their 
earlier albums as well. Highlights of their set 
included a moving rendition of “Jesus, Etc,” a 
face-melting version of “At Least That’s What 
You Said,” and an unexpected yet gorgeous 
performance of the sparse “Reservations.” 
In contrast, their decision not to play what 
is by far their second-most popular song 
(“California Stars”) was curious yet powerful. 
They reeled off almost thirty songs in total; 
concertgoers certainly got their money’s 
worth in that respect. 
Nels Cline is one of the most talented 
guitarists of his generation. If you hadn’t been 
aware of that entering Hill Auditorium, you 
were certainly aware of it by the time you left. 
He fired off blistering solo after solo, a truly 
impressive display. That said, I think he is far 
from alone in the unfortunate belief that the 

amount and frequency of notes you play in a 
given amount of time are directly correlated 
with the quality of a guitar solo. At a certain 
point, the melody is neglected in favor of 
technical prowess, and it begins to feel as 
though I’m watching a gymnastic exhibition 
rather than a musical performance.
Jeff Tweedy cuts an unassuming figure on 
stage, his relaxed demeanor likely a product of 
over 30 years of experience. His interactions 
with the audience were minimal yet radiated 
a quiet confidence. Tweedy gently ribbed the 
crowd for being low-energy a few times during 
the set — with the exception of the people at 
the front who rocked out for just about every 
song (and who Jeff Tweedy lightheartedly 
accused of sneaking in alcohol), the audience 
was barely capable of remaining on their feet, 
let alone displaying any sort of passionate 
enjoyment of the music. Unfortunately, this 
was not the case with the man behind me who 
doggedly clapped along enthusiastically to 
each song, unaccompanied and offbeat.
While Hill Auditorium is undoubtedly a 
beautiful venue with superb acoustic qualities, 
I have never seen a show there that was not 
lacking in crowd energy. I attribute this to a 
combination of the older clientele it attracts 
as well as the cramped layout of the seating, 
which does not provide sufficient space for the 
audience to stand up and get into the music. 
Diehard Wilco fans will undoubtedly have 
left Hill Auditorium satisfied, while more 
casual listeners likely enjoyed the experience 
but could have gone for less extended guitar 
freakouts (e.g. “We Were Lucky”). A few 
questionable setlist choices aside, it was a 
largely pleasing performance; a nice snapshot 
of a band, and its audience, ageing gracefully 
together.

Wilco at Hill was a little bit
boring, but also pleasing?

CONCERT REVIEW

JONAH MENDELSON
Daily Arts Writer

In the house where I spent my first ten years, 
there was a big stove and oven contraption set 
into the wall of the kitchen. The behemoth was 
surrounded by terracotta tiles, Tuscan floral 
reliefs that only the seventies could produce. It was 
a suburban fantasy that any housewife would cry 
before. The stove, in its cave of orange sunflowers, 
had little red lights near the knobs of each of the 
burners to tell when they were hot, as most stoves 
do. My first experience of being burned came as a 
result of this.
When my parents got married, they received a 
perfectly-curated set of kitchen supplies including 
several shiny Calphalon pots and pans. We ate a 
lot of pasta. Every time my mom would boil water 
for dinner, I would sit in front of the stove as she 
cooked, entranced by the red light that reflected 
up onto each pot’s perfect silver surface. This went 
on for months when I was around four years old 
until I finally worked up the courage to see what 
those lights truly were. I waited until she moved to 
the other side of the kitchen to grab the butter and 
went for the prize. My hand reached out slowly as 
I stared at the red swirl of the light in an almost 
hypnotic trance. I smelled barbecue and suddenly 
felt a jolt of pain run up my arm. 
“Clara!” My mother exclaimed. I felt tears 
running down my face as I realized what had 
happened. Of course it wasn’t a ghost orb or some 
fancy jewel, I said to my four-year-old self, and 
now I have to wear a Band-Aid. 
In that hundred-year-old house with the bay 
window, I grew up happily, for the most part. 
There is a tendency to romanticize what you 
can’t completely remember, but the snippets of 
summer in that home are something I have always 
treasured. 
The only problem was that we were in Michigan, 
a state whose reputation is relegated to few things 
other than Detroit, lakes, cherries and brutal 
winters. Every year, like clockwork, the snow 
would blanket that house like a low-hanging fog, 
draping the stucco in a dreamlike curtain of cold. 
My parents would climb out onto the flat roof of 
our mudroom to cut ice off of the asphalt surface, 
pushing it past the ornate windowpanes and into 
the frost. I watched in awe as they managed not 
to fall off and die, as they warned we would if my 
siblings and I even thought about mimicking them. 
But even when the ice melted, when the birds 
came back out and we started to have a groundhog 
breeding problem again, my hands stayed cold.
They say in the laws of thermodynamics that 
cold is not a concept on its own — instead, it is 
the absence of heat. If that is true, my whole life 
has been devoted to chasing what I don’t have. 
Although my mother did not believe me until 
high school, we share the same genetic syndrome 
called Raynaud’s, a minor yet annoying affliction 
that prevents blood from circulating completely 
through our hands and feet. Because of this, I will 
most definitely have cold feet on the night before 
my wedding and every other night of my life, too. 
Maybe that’s part of why I have been burned so 
many times, from that moment in the kitchen at 
age four to a curling-iron mishap only two weeks 
ago. I don’t feel a fire until I smell smoke, and I 
don’t realize I’ve been burned until it’s too late to 
go back.

There has been a fireplace in every home my 
family’s lived in, and I have always sat too close, 
waiting in front of the flames until I couldn’t 
stand it anymore. When the temperature drops 
each year, I prepare myself for the inevitable 
white fingertips I’ll end up with after five minutes 
outside, the numbness, the apologies I’ll make for 
my vampirish touch. My friends have taken to 
calling me “skeleton woman” every time I grab 
them, my pale hands like ice on their skin. They 
recoil, and my stomach flips over inside my core as 
I wonder if I’ll ever hold someone in comfort. 
I’ve always remained at a cool 97 degrees, even 
when I wanted to be anything else. My fevers only 
reach 100, and I was always sent to school as a sick 
child because of this. My mother texts me “are 
you staying warm?” on an almost-daily basis. It’s 
laughable the way that heat, or the lack of it, has 
colored my life. The first time I dated a boy I really, 
truly liked, I avoided public affection in fear of his 
response to my temperature. He wanted to hold 
hands on the street, and I feigned an arm cramp. 
I almost burned myself again trying to warm up 
my freezing fingers with a hairdryer before dinner 
one night. We kissed, we laid next to each other, I 
strategically hung my feet off the edge of the bed.
It’s stupid, childish, for me to do these things, 
but I always fear what my aura of cold will tell 
someone what my own words don’t: that I’m 
nervous, uninterested, that my heart isn’t beating 
a million miles a minute when that should be clear. 
Those who know me would describe me as warm, 
but my body doesn’t hear it. Instead, I sit by the 
radiator, by the space heater, by the fire. But at least 
there are glimpses into the heat that my blood is 
supposed to run at, a signal that I’m still alive. 
And I think that’s the thing that really scares 
me: If being human is wrapped up in our heat, our 
passion, anger, love, what does it mean to be cold? 
Am I any less alive because my touch doesn’t say 
so? I have fought for my life as it is, through illness 
and unhappiness, but it seems that my body hasn’t 
caught up yet. When that day comes, there will be a 
celebration within me. But for now, I will wait and 
live, even if my hands feel like those of a corpse.

The winter lurking within

NOTEBOOK

CLARA SCOTT
Daily Gender & Media Columnist

When I first heard Wiki featured on Run The Jewels’s “Blockbuster 
Night Pt. 2” and Earl Sweatshirt’s “AM // Radio,” I was pretty stoked 
— he reeked of the underground hip-hop sound that I vibed with so 
hard. Then his first solo tape, Lil Me, dropped, and its mediocrity 
eradicated all my interest in the up-and-coming New York rapper 
with the quirky 
drawl. I passed 
over his debut 
and never really 
dived into his 
past work with 
Ratking. 
But 
I would never 
skip 
anything 
with 
Madlib’s 
footprint 
on 
it, 
so 
when 
Wiki 
dropped 
the 
Madlib-
produced 
“Eggs” 
last 
September, 
I 
was excited to 
see him bring 
his A-game.
Right away, OOFIE doesn’t set itself up for success. “Downfall” is 
a standard “I failed but I swear I’m bringing it back this time” type 
track, not unlike something you might find on an Eminem album. 
It’s unclear what failure he’s talking about: Maybe disappointment 
with himself because he’s never had a break-out single or album, 
although that doesn’t seem like the kind of worry Wiki would 
have. Regardless of what it concerns, hearing themes of self-
disappointment at the very beginning doesn’t set a good tone for 
the album. At best, it’s uninteresting, and at worst, it’s cringe-y 
(remember J. Cole’s “Let Nas Down”?). I want to grab Wiki by the 
collar and say, just show us what you got already!
Digging into the music, most of OOFIE is underwhelming, and 
not in any particularly interesting way. Every song is in a sort of 
weird middle ground where it’s hard to tell if it’s supposed to be a 
chill kickback track or something that slaps in the car. Not that all 
hip hop has to fit neatly into those categories, but the album just 

doesn’t seem very sure-footed in its direction. I think I’m supposed 
to have the windows down in the car during “Pesto” and I think I’m 
supposed to drink a beer on the porch to “The Routine,” but a good 
song should make me think, I can’t wait to blast this in the car or I 
can’t wait to listen to this while I’m chilling with the boys. The only 
thing that crossed my mind was I could probably do the dishes to this.
Something that holds this album back is a lack of progression 
in the production on most of the tracks. Typically the beat you 
hear at the beginning carries the music all the way through. This 
is fine for bite-size tracks but it’s easy to lose interest during your 
typical three-minute-30-second song. Wiki’s focus on making 
lyrical lemonade can only carry a song so far, especially when so 
many lines don’t land well (“When you poppin’ Perkies, she pop her 
pussy / She drop her tushy, she almost hurt me” … really?). None 
of the beats are interesting enough to carry a listener through 
the whole track, which is dangerous — in today’s era of hip hop 
production, lackluster production is a death sentence. Tracks like 
“The Routine” have an interesting, quirky lead sample, but the rest 
of the production doesn’t do it justice. More uninteresting drum 
patterns and woozy, unexciting pads. It’s no wonder the album ends 
up feeling purposeless.
The only beats that are juicy enough to carry through an entire 
song are on “Dame Aqui” and “Way That I Am,” but I still probably 
wouldn’t listen to them 
again if it weren’t for 
their features. Princess 
Nokia blesses the beat 
with her own sixteen 
bars on “Dame Aqui,” 
while Your Old Droog 
and Wiki hold down an 
entertaining back-and-
forth on “Way That I 
Am.” At some point, 
it became clear that I 
was waiting for Wiki to 
finish and his features 
to start. That should 
have been obvious on 
“Grim” where Lil Ugly 
Mane and Denzel Curry 
outshine Wiki to an 
embarrassing degree.
Wiki’s choruses are 
also a stain on every 

song. Typically signified by Wiki layering his vocals, it’s mostly 
annoying. There’s no saving the hook to “4 Clove Club.” It would have 
been more interesting if he went the MF-Doom route and just cut the 
hooks out from the start. I want to give Wiki more credit — some of 
his writing is really slick, like “Grand maestro of the metro / Damn, 
your hand swipes slow, while I get dough” on “Pesto.” It just doesn’t 
have any room to stand out, especially put next to pen game demons 
like Your Old Droog spitting burns like “Lames on Rap Genius 
wanna speak for the God 
like televangelists.”
When it comes down 
to it, OOFIE has only 
convinced me of something 
I was pretty certain I 
already knew: Wiki is a 
feature rapper and doesn’t 
have the creativity to hold 
down a track on his own. 
He fits in a cool niche of 
underground rappers with 
a strong pen game, yeah. 
Your Old Droog fills the 
same space, though, and 
he executes his ideas way 
better. It took a Madlib 
beat to put Wiki back on 
my radar, and it’ll take 
something 
better 
than 
OOFIE to keep him from 
falling off again.

FOR RENT

“Playing with Fire” is a movie that does exactly 
what it’s supposed to do: entertain. Directed by 
Andy Fickman (“Race to Witch Mountain”), it 
may not be a cinematic masterpiece with a heart 
wrenching plot or clever camerawork, but it 
succeeds in capturing your attention and making 
you laugh (despite admittedly cheesy stunts and 
dialogue). 
As a Nickelodeon movie, I expected it to be a 
short, feel-good, family-friendly movie, which 
at first concerned me. I’d thought that since 
the target demographic was primarily kids, it’d 
be predictable and not worth watching. It was 
predictable, but in the end, it was also worth 
watching. It’s another movie with a tough guy 
with a “manly” job, Jake Carson (John Cena, 
“Bumblebee”), who is forced to take care of some 
kids and eventually learns to love them and to 
open himself up to vulnerability. We’ve all seen 
that movie before. It was never the plot that was 
going to make the movie worthwhile, though. 
That will always be the job of humor. 
“Playing with Fire” may have been a movie 
with humor made for 12-year-old boys, but I will 
admit with no shame that there was at least one 
18-year-old girl in the theater laughing harder 
than probably all the other kids in the audience. 
For me, the best part of the movie was hands down 
Keegan-Michael Key’s portrayal of Mark. I’m 
not sure if it was the hilarious kissing-up nature 
of his character towards Cena’s character or the 
exaggerated exasperation he had towards the kids 
in the movie, but nearly all of his lines had me 
laughing. Sidenote — there are bloopers at the end 
of the movie, most of which feature Key’s natural 
hilarity and unfortunate (but priceless) tendency 
for slapstick humor. 
There were low points in the film, too. Jake and 
Amy’s (Judy Greer, “13 Going on 30”) relationship 
is unnecessary and forced. The three kids do a 
mostly great job of balancing being funny and 
being slightly annoying (like all kids), but Brynn 

(Brianna Hildebrand, “Deadpool”), left something 
to be desired. Her character got on my nerves 
more often than not, and her warming up to Jake 
was not as gradual as it should have been to make 
it believable. The first two days she did everything 
she could to get on his nerves, and then the 
next two she made a complete 180. It didn’t feel 
realistic.
Despite those flaws, though, the movie is worth 
seeing. However, I’m not sure if the movie theater 
is a necessary component of its viewing experience. 
Frankly, this is the kind of movie that you want to 
watch with your wife and kids. There’s something 
about the overused, cheesy moral of the story that 
makes you want to see it in your pajamas on your 
sofa and with your family, even though you may 
want to roll your eyes at it and claim that you’re 
too old for a movie like this. You can say whatever 
you want to preserve your reputation, but chances 
are, “Playing with Fire” will make you laugh a lot 
and will have you turning the television off with a 
genuine, satisfied smile.

‘Playing With Fire’ is fun

FILM REVIEW

SABRIYA IMAMI
Daily Arts Writer

At my public high school everything around 
me attempted to dissuade me from becoming the 
quintessential “theatre kid.” My school left our arts 
programs severely underfunded and, as collateral, 
underespected. It wouldn’t have been too difficult to 
transfer some of the athletic funds to the drama club, but 
I often stood in the athletic director’s office pleading for 
help. Would money remedy the problematic treatment 
of theatre kids? No. Would it help foster the respect 
needed from the administration to make theatre kids 
feel worthy of our choice to participate in drama club? 
Yes. 
High school students who participate in arts 
programs are sometimes considered inferior by peers, 
and it isn’t so easy to rise above the stereotype when the 
school system itself doesn’t want to aid in promoting 
success for choir, drama club, band and other arts 
groups. Football players are rendered god-like and have 
their successes announced on the loudspeaker in the 
morning, inflating their ever-growing egos. They take 
rides in plush buses to travel to games comfortably and 
have fully-packed stadiums of fans. The school drama 
club fights for enough money for a single bus to attend 
competitions. Our mothers held bake sales because they 
felt as though it was our only choice to cover the cost 
of new microphones. Overall, high school drama clubs 
feel a consistent lack of support from school activity 
coordinators and the larger community. 
In the social ladder of high schools, the theatre kids 
are often on the bottom, just above the chess players 
or the band geeks. At the top rest the lacrosse players, 
below the “popular for no good reason” girls who 
are just beat out by the football players. It never made 
much sense to me why, in the world of high school, 
my desire to participate in the musical over the soccer 
team automatically made me a loser — someone who 
shouldn’t be invited to cool parties and didn’t attend 
football games or have as worthy a presence as someone 
who played a sport. Just because I’d opted for rehearsal 
and showtunes over pasta parties and practice, I was an 
outsider. 
Given that I was involved in both cross country and 
theatre, I saw the immense benefits of both institutions. 
Ever since I was young, despite my desire to be athletic, 
I’d always been more drawn to the arts. I loved my cross 
country team in high school. I craved the sweat and the 
competition, the sense of unwavering teamwork and 
ultimate thrill we felt upon winning. But often times I 

felt like I didn’t belong. Sports teams at my school were 
cliquey and always looked toward the win, not the 
journey it had taken to get to that final game or match. 
Something about athletics seemed too serious and 
grave when to me it wasn’t that deep. A loss was a loss, a 
win was a win. In theatre, I didn’t have to deal with the 
crippling anxiety that we wouldn’t win or that we had 
to. We were just making art, we were coming together 
to stretch our minds and ourselves. And it was beautiful. 
As someone who split her time between artistic 
and athletic pursuits, I can’t quite understand how in 
American high schools the latter automatically makes 
you hot and the former makes you lame. Sports games 
will always be sports games. They will always be 
American pastimes, they will always add entertainment 
to our lives. I will always enjoy football and basketball. 
But will these events and groups provide culture? Will 
they provide wider understanding and open the door to 
communicating on the basis of art? Will they provoke 
people to change their minds, to think? Will they 
inspire? 
Upon graduating from high school I attended a Big 
10 university in the midwest to study theatre and was 
hit with a massive realization: The theatre kids aren’t 
losers. The artists aren’t unworthy. The musicians 
aren’t geeks. Here at the University of Michigan there 
is talent pouring from the walls of our drama building, 
our music building, our dance building, and the high 
level of creative excellence produced by student 
artists is simply unmatched. The community respects 
theatre kids, acknowledges their hard work, applauds 
them. The vapid high school notion that my choice of 
extracurricular made me ultimately less likeable, less 
“cool,” less worthy of friendship had subsided. I was 
now among a cohort of people who, for doing the arts, 
were cool, trendy, fascinating and unique. Constantly, 
though, I wonder how many students from my high 
school (and ones like it) decided not to pursue drama 
club because of the downtrodden social status that 
comes along with it. I wonder how many students give 
up on their artistic dreams because high school is a time 
when, for the most part, we hope to blend in and not 
make ourselves known.
The theatre kids will stick together, always. We 
will be a united front, we will push past the 16-year-
old bullies of our high school hallways and continue to 
create. We will continue to wonder, to inspire, to write 
and direct and perform. Because in the deep of the 
night, it has nothing to do with who will fund us, who 
will support us, who won’t laugh at us — it has to do with 
the impact we make when we make art, something that 
is and always will be a win.

Theatre kids are alright

A reeling Michigan State team comes in ready to play its ostensible 
Super Bowl against the No. 15 Michigan football team, with the 
trajectory of its program in peril. Still, the Spartans have won eight of 
the previous 12 matchups between the in-state rivals, and come into 
this one presumably eager to do anything to keep it competitive.

What to watch for when Michigan takes 
the field on Saturday against MSU.

Middle Tennessee State (Aug. 31): Look man, 
the middle of Tennessee is decidedly not a state.

Army (Sept. 7): Y’all remember when Army 
almost beat Michigan? Wild stuff.

Penn State (Oct. 19): Look, you don’t just go 
into the hallowed grounds of *checks notes* 
TCF Bank Stadium and emerge victorious. 

Notre Dame (Oct. 26): Organized religion is a 
sham. Eat at Arby’s.

Maryland (Nov. 2): Maybe Mike Locksley and 
Josh Gattis shouldn’t have been so quick to fight 
over credit for their offense after all.

Wisconsin (Sept. 21): Sure, your town is sick 
and your beer is elite and Jump Around is cool 
and your campus is on multiple lakes and ... 

Michigan State (Nov. 16): The Michigan Daily 
has beaten The State News 14 years in a row.
Rutgers (Sept. 28): My grandma’s New Jersey 
retirement home mahjong group could beat Rut-
gers in football ... basketball would be close, too.

Iowa (Oct. 5): The year is 2080. Aliens have 
taken over. Iowa capped off a 7-5 season with a 
five-year extension for Kirk Ferentz. All is well.

Illinois (Oct. 12): It turns out Lovie Smith does 
still have a pulse!

Ohio State (Nov. 30): I’m sure Chase Young 
learned his lesson.

Indiana (Nov. 23): Let’s all take a moment to 
eulogize the Penix puns we could have made. 
Gone but not forgotten.

Michigan 27
MSU 7
MSU is in complete 
freefall, while Michi-
gan is playing its best 
football of the season. 
The Spartans’ defense 
has been vulnerable for 
weeks. Anything less 
than an easy win would 
be a disappointment.

Michigan 24
MSU 3
This is one of those 
games the Michigan 
defense just grabs 
hold of and suffocates. 
Michigan State will top 
the 94 yards from last 
year. But not by much. 
The Wolverines snag 
an early lead and hide.

Michigan 31
MSU 10
The talent gap is too 
much in this game. I 
can’t see Michigan State 
moving the ball much 
Michigan’s defense. 
Even if it’s not a com-
plete beatdown, Michi-
gan should pull away 
late in the game.

Michigan 38
MSU 7
Michigan hasn’t lost 
at home in two years, 
and by “hasn’t lost at 
home,” I mean “has 
three blowout wins 
against better teams 
than the Spartans. I 
see no reason why this 
game will be different.

COVER/PAGE DESIGN BY ALEX STONE

Scott Sypniewski cried. He sobbed, actually. He was in the visitor’s 
locker room at Memorial Stadium in Bloomington, still in uniform. 
His hand grasped John Baxter’s, his head resting on his coordinator’s 
shoulder.
It has been four years exactly from that day to the publication 
of this story. Sypniewski works now in Chicago as a recruiting 
coordinator for NCSA, a company that helps high school athletes 
boost their recruiting profiles. It has been two years since he 
graduate transferred from Michigan to Vanderbilt, over a year since 
his last NFL tryout with the Jacksonville Jaguars ended without a 
callback. He is living his life, normal and anonymous, as far removed 
from that snap — the snap — against Michigan State and the world 
encompassing it as could be.
And still, when Sypniewski tells the story of all that led to that 
moment at Indiana, when everything poured out of him, he gets 
choked up.
Minutes before going to the locker room, as Delano Hill broke up 
a fourth-down attempt in the end zone and the rest of Michigan’s 
football team converged around him, Sypniewski was celebrating, 
too. His hands flew in the air in elation. He lifted his head and turned 
to walk off the field. Then he saw his father. He’s always been good at 
finding his family in the crowd, he says now.
“I saw him shaking his head,” Sypniewski said. “And he was starting 
to cry.”

That was when Sypniewski ran up the tunnel, into the visitor’s 

locker room and started sobbing. 
Sypniewski cried then because of the emotions of the four 
weeks preceding that moment, because everything that 
bubbles beneath the surface of any athlete finally burst, and 
because for him — in those four weeks — that load exceeded 
its capacity. He gets choked up now when he tells the story 
because even in relative anonymity, four years after the 
fact, those emotions never quite left. When one error 
defines you, it stays with you.
As for that error, the clip has been played thousands of 
times over. You’ve seen it. You’ll see it again this weekend. 
There are 10 seconds left in the game, it’s fourth-and-two 
and Michigan leads, 23-21. Sypniewski is right there in the 
center, holding onto the ball, his head looking between his 
legs, readying for a motion he had done thousands of times 
before.
Instead of hitting the strike zone, the football wavers and 
dips. Blake O’Neill drops it, bends down, tries to pick it up. 
Sean McDonough’s voice goes up an octave. Jalen Watts-
Jackson, a Michigan State safety, runs the ball into the end 
zone as time expires. Michigan loses in impossible fashion to 
a hated rival.
Sypniewski, to be clear, was not universally blamed. Unlike 
O’Neill, who spent the following week as the face of the error, 
getting vitriol heaped on his social media, Sypniewski lived 
with the anonymity of a long snapper. In a way, that made all 
that happened over the next month that much harder. The 
blame he had to get past was not that of others, but his own.
Four years later, past a football career and well into living 
real life with a real job, he’s asked how long it took to 
move on.
“That’s a good question,” he said. “I don’t know. I don’t 
know. I don’t think I have an answer to that. 

“Maybe I’ll let you know in like five years?”

***

Sypniewski didn’t think his grandfather 

would be able to watch him play football 

at Michigan. And yet, after making it 

to every high school game, he was at 

nearly every college home game, too. 

“My grandpa basically lived to watch me play,” Sypniewski said. 
Which meant that when Sypniewski exited the locker room the night 
of the 2015 Michigan State game and walked back to his family — at a 
tailgate put on by a group of parents — his grandpa was there.
All the faces at the tailgate were expressionless. It was less than an 
hour after the end of the game — nobody knew what to say or how to 
talk about what had happened. “It wasn’t … the best physical tailgate 
to be in,” said Andrew Robinson, Sypniewski’s friend and a backup 
long snapper on the 2015 team.
Sypniewski’s grandfather pulled him out of the tailgate and sat him 
down. Along with Sypniewski’s father, he stressed that Scott couldn’t 
dwell on this and had to move forward. The kinds of cliches that 
people always fall back on, in the kind of situation where it’s hard to 
apply them.
“He was definitely someone who was right there, putting his 
arm around my shoulder and telling me it’s gonna be OK, really,” 
Sypniewski said. “And then my dad. My dad’s been through a lot of 
crap, too. He kinda knows that you can’t dwell on it. Just gotta keep 
moving forward. You can’t even think about it. Even though it gets 
brought up every time someone recognizes me.”
Sypniewski’s path to that moment came with good luck at every turn. 
His father played for Western Michigan in the 1980s, for a coaching 
staff that included Brady Hoke, Greg Mattison and Dan Ferrigno — 
all Michigan coaches when he was a recruit. When it became clear 
Sypniewski was good enough to be a long snapper in college, he 
could only get a preferred walk-on offer from the Broncos. He visited 
Hoke expecting the same and almost broke down crying when a full 
scholarship was offered. On the car ride home, Sypniewski made his 
dad pull over so he could call Hoke and commit.
When Jim Harbaugh took over the program in Sypniewski’s redshirt 
freshman year, he didn’t just keep the starting job he was in line 
for, but he retained his scholarship. Within a tight-knit group of 
specialists, Sypniewski was viewed as a leader.
“He’s a good guy, really likable guy,” said Kyle Seychel, a walk-on who 
played on special teams from 2014-17. “And I just looked up I guess. I 
guess that’s the impression. I still have that to this day.”
Those strokes of luck in his recruitment inform his career now. 
NCSA, the company Sypniewski works for, is essentially a college 
counseling service for recruits. He used it himself in high school 
when trying to get noticed as a long snapper, a position where lack 
of recognition tends to be inherent. It’s a job that allows him to stay 
near sports while, generally, avoiding the spotlight that can come 
with being at the center of disaster.
Sypniewski, though, wants to clarify what happened and his role in 
all of it.
When Baxter, Sypniewski and O’Neill watched the tape of the 
botched snap after the season, having avoided it until then, they 
noticed O’Neill looked like he was lined up further back than normal. 
They rewound and watched again, counting the yards. “Probably did 
it like 30 times,” Sypniewski said. O’Neill had been taught to line up 
15 yards behind Sypniewski. When Michigan lined up to punt with 
10 seconds left against Michigan State, O’Neill was 17 yards behind 
Sypniewski. The ball dipped because it was snapped to 15.
“That’s usually one of the things that I tell people when people ask 
me, is that, well first off, you can’t say — I don’t want to put anyone 
in the ground here,” Sypniewski said. “But that was one of the things 
why I wanted to kind of tell my story about it, from my perspective.”
O’Neill declined to talk for this story when contacted through 
Sypniewski and didn’t respond to a direct message. Baxter, through a 
USC spokesperson, declined to talk as well.
Seychel pulls up the video while on the phone to verify, having not 
seen it in a while. He, too, counts the yards. “Oh yeah. That’s right,” 
he says. “Right at his feet. I’m sorry, man. I haven’t seen this play in a 
while. … I try not to think about it.
“... If he was standing at 14 yards, it might have been right at his 

chest.”
Sypniewski, on top of the snap itself, broke his thumb against the 
Spartans. Because that game was followed by a bye week, he didn’t 
miss any time, playing the next game against Minnesota. The 
following week, against Rutgers, he was running downfield and got 
decleated. The hit ruptured the bursa sac in his right knee. It swelled, 
then got infected.
He spent the week leading up to the Indiana game with a 103-degree 
fever, not practicing. His roommates, Robinson and Kenny Allen, had 
to stay at the Campus Inn until the team left. Harbaugh didn’t let 
Sypniewski travel to Bloomington with the team, but he told him he 
could play if he could get to the game. So Sypniewski’s parents drove 
up to Ann Arbor from Chicago on Friday morning, then drove him to 
Bloomington. He stayed in his own hotel room.
The morning of the game, Sypniewski dressed, keeping Harbaugh 
to his word. When he went out for warmups, he had to run back to 
the bench on the first field goal snap, Robinson recalled, “because 
he thought he was gonna throw up on the ball.” Still, he played. And 
when Michigan won, he cried.
“I couldn’t control any emotions,” Sypniewski said, “and it was kind 
of like collective part of everything that happened from the Michigan 
State game to then. All of it was just coming out and the fact that 
we won, I was finally done, I could just go home. That season, that 
stretch of four games, it really tested who I was.”
***
Twenty minutes after saying he doesn’t know how long it took to 
move on, Sypniewski claims he’s done so. Certainly, he seems to be 
over playing football.
He tried to catch on in the NFL after his year at Vanderbilt, but 
decided after a year he couldn’t keep sitting by his phone every 
Monday and Tuesday, waiting for a call. If something comes out of 
the sky, he’s game, but Sypniewksi wanted to start his next career.
He notices when the snap gets played on TV, but says he’s past it. 
When people bring it up, he goes to the same joke — “How many 
times were you the number one play of the year on the ESPYs?” When 
SportsCenter played it every hour on the play’s four-year anniversary 
last month and people around his office joked with him, Sypniewski 
took it in stride.
“Obviously you think about it every time it gets played on TV, you 
kind of put yourself back in that place, cause you know exactly what 
was going through your head when you were doing it,” Sypniewski 
said. “To say that I still dwell on it, that’s not true at all. 
“It’s over.”
Yet, he wants his perspective out there, wants people to understand 
the play was more than a 15-second video to be looped and a meme 
to be shared. On a given day, Robinson estimated, Michigan could 
have three practice periods devoted to special teams with about 30 
minutes a week devoted to punts. About three times a week, Michigan 
would practice against punt block looks like the one Michigan State 
broke out on that fourth down.
None of that, of course, accounts for the work Sypniewski and others 
did on the sidelines as the offense and defense practiced. None of it 
accounts for the minutiae that goes into long snapping, the thousands 
of reps and the sheer bad luck it takes for a mistake to occur in that 
moment. None of it accounts for the next week, either, when Michigan 
installed an emergency punt for a similar situation, where the punter 
stood a yard up, caught the ball and one-step kicked it. 
Amid a conversation touching on all the minutiae of everything that 
happened four years ago, Sypniewski finds a moment to talk about 
moving forward, keeping a short memory. He laughs.
Those 10 seconds led to tears in Bloomington and years of reminders. 
They will stay in the memory of Sypniewski, and Michigan, for years 
to come.
“It’s crazy that something like that was only 10 seconds long,” he says, 
“but that’s what people remember.”

223 North Main Street
Ann Arbor, Michigan

734-665-5340

What to watch for: Michigan State

There are, realistically, two ways in which 
Saturday’s 
rivalry 
showdown 
between 
Michigan (7-2 overall, 4-2 Big Ten) and 
Michigan State (4-5, 2-4) plays out.
The first, and the most likely, follows 
down the path of least resistance. The 
Spartans rank 61st in offensive efficiency, 
according to ESPN.com’s rankings. They 
haven’t won a game since Sept. 28 and come 
into this matchup with the Wolverines 
fresh off blowing a 25-point lead at home to 
Illinois. 
In that respect, the 13.5-point spread 
seems low, a direct nod to the emphasis 
Michigan State and its coach, Mark 
Dantonio, place on this game.
But that emphasis — which, it should be 
noted, has guided the Spartans to victories 
in eight of the previous 12 matchups between 
the sides — cannot be ignored, even in the 
bleakest of times in East Lansing.
Asked Monday what the common thread 
has been in his team’s games against 
Michigan 
State, 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh offered a cagey retort.
“Common 
thread 
would 
be 
very 
competitive and intense.”
It’s to be seen whether Saturday will be 

competitive, but high intensity is a foregone 
conclusion. Here’s what to watch for in 
Saturday’s rivalry bout.
Any antics?
Indelible images of Devin Bush scraping 
his cleats across the logo 
at Spartan Stadium last 
year no doubt still linger 
in Michigan State’s mind. 
The then-junior linebacker 
had no problem letting his 
feelings out before the game, 
hours before his defense 
held the Spartans to 94 total 
yards.
There are rivalries in 
which 
mutual 
respect 
breeds a kind of pageantry — 
take the Red River Rivalry, 
for example. This is nothing of the sort. 
Michigan-Michigan State is a slap fight in 
which each side keeps its hands dutifully by 
its sides until they step on the field. Then it 
convulses left, right, up and down for three 
hours.
That kind of attitude often breeds 
altercation, 
sometimes 
premeditated, 
often not. Michigan players and coaches 
hardly indicated a desire for such events to 
transpire. 
“You watch it, you kind of get the feel 

of the rivalry,” said sophomore defensive 
lineman Aidan Hutchinson on Monday. “But 
when you’re actually in it — you’re hitting 
them, you’re talking a little bit — that’s when 
things kind of intensify.”
Trick plays
By now, you, a dutiful 
observer of this game and 
these 
teams, 
probably 
understand 
the 
threat 
Dantonio’s 
trick 
plays 
pose. There’s plenty more 
about this in Aria’s film 
breakdown, but the threat 
behind those off-schedule, 
unusual looks is to derail and 
dethrone the superior team.
Last 
year, 
Michigan 
State’s 
lone 
touchdown 
came off a reverse that ended in a four-
yard pass from receiver Darrell Stewart 
Jr. to quarterback Brian Lewerke. All of a 
sudden, an offense that had shown nothing 
but ineptitude was locked in a 7-7 game in 
the middle of the third quarter. Momentum 
swung. The crowd came to life.
It’s quite clear Dantonio’s tactics have 
kept Harbaugh up at night this week.
“You look at everything a team has done 
in terms of fakes or misdirection. Deceptive 
type of plays,” Harbaugh said. “And what 
they’ve done, and OK, we’ve prepared for 
that, but also what is a possible complement 
to something that they’ve already done that 

they could be working on, they could be 
practicing? Alert for everything.”
It seems unlikely a couple successful trick 
plays will be enough to overcome everything 
else. But perhaps one early in the game to 
re-configure the expectations, or one late in 
a game that unfolds tighter than expected, 
could be the spark the underdog Spartans 
need.
Rushing game
There’s not a ton to glean from Michigan 
State rushing for 275 yards last week against 
Illinois, as the Illini rank 101st in the nation 
in rushing defense. But the roadmap for a 
Spartans’ upset runs through its rushing 
attack.
Running back Elijah Collins offers a 
formidable threat against a Michigan 
defense that will be foaming at the mouth. 
On the flip side, the Wolverines will 
undoubtedly look to establish their running 
game at the outset. In its last four games, 
Michigan has averaged 223.5 rushing 
yards per game. Meanwhile, the Spartans’ 
strength, no matter the skid, remains their 
rush defense, which ranks 16th in the nation.
The only way Michigan State comes out of 
this victorious — nabbing one of the bigger 
upsets in the recent history of this rivalry — 
is mucking up the game, making it ugly and 
then winning through smoke and mirrors. 
Scoff, if you want. The Spartans have only 
built their entire program off their ability 
to do just that.

Breaking down Michigan State’s infamous array of trick plays

During his Monday press conference, a 
day when all eyes were on the Michigan-
Michigan State rivalry, Jim Harbaugh 
mentioned trick plays four different times.
It’s for good reason — Michigan State 
coach Mark Dantonio is notorious for 
his trick plays. He’s run them for years, 
with well-known plays dating back to the 
beginning of his tenure in East Lansing. 
The Wolverines are well aware how much 
hate goes into this rivalry, and they know 
that Dantonio’s trickery is another thing 
to look out for.
“(We’re) on high alert for everything,” 
Harbaugh said Monday. “We understand, 
Mark Dantonio’s a master motivator and 
there could be trick plays, special teams, 
punt fakes, field goal fakes. Everything 
needs to be alerted and prepared and 
ready.”
But what are these trick plays, and what 
can Michigan do to prepare for them? The 
Daily dug into the film, breaking down 
several of the Spartans’ trick plays from 
the 2018 season.
The fake punt
The opponent: Penn State
The down: 4th-and-6, MSU 34
The situation: First quarter, down 
7-0
It’s clear that this fake punt fooled the 
camera operator, too, so it’s a little tough 
to tell what’s going on at first.
Michigan State lined up in a normal 
punt formation, but the ball was instead 
snapped to No. 11, running back Connor 
Heyward. With the return team on the 
field, there’s no one there to stop Heyward, 
who gets outside for a 26-yard gain.
Later in the drive, the Spartans scored 
a touchdown.
The key to this play was the element of 
surprise. Nobody expects a fake punt in 
the first quarter in a team’s own territory. 
The Nittany Lions understandably weren’t 
lined up properly to stop such a play, and 
that’s why it worked. No matter how alert 
you are, you can’t line up on every punt 
like it’s going to be a fake.
As far as the actual playcall, this 
is pretty low-risk for a fake punt, and 
the main requirement is faith in your 
blockers. But the game situation increases 
the risk — Heyward had to make it at least 
six yards starting from behind the line 
of scrimmage, and had he been stuffed, 
Penn State would have taken over with 
excellent field position.
Heyward, one of Michigan State’s go-to 
guys on trick plays, is now in the transfer 
portal. But presumably, the Spartans have 
practiced this with a variety of players 
who know how to execute it. No matter 
who’s running it, the Wolverines have 
dedicated preparation time for these sorts 
of situations and they’re very familiar 

with how a play like this could work.
“We’ve definitely gone back, I wanna 
be accurate here, Michigan-Michigan 
State 12 years ago, they ran a fake punt or 
something,” said Michigan special teams 
coach Chris Partridge. “We’ve seen it all. 
We’ve seen every fake punt that they’ve 
run probably for 12 years. … The last three 
fake punts are exactly the same.”
The fake field goal
The opponent: Indiana
The down: 4th-and-3, Indiana 6
The situation: Third quarter, up 21-7
The fake punt was a fairly simple play. 
This one has a lot more moving parts.
Let’s be honest here: Michigan State 
didn’t really need to run an elaborate fake 
field goal up by two scores in the third 
quarter, but this is just what the Spartans 
do. And again, they had the element of 
surprise working in their favor.
On most teams, the holder doubles 
as the punter or backup quarterback. 
(Michigan’s holder, for example, is senior 
punter Will Hart.) But Michigan State’s 
holder is starting quarterback Brian 
Lewerke, allowing them to draw up a 
variety of fake field goal plays that have a 
higher percentage than what many others 
can do.
Instead of holding for a kick, Lewerke 
(No. 14) takes the snap himself and 
scrambles for a few yards before pitching 

the ball to No. 4, the kicker, Matt Coghlin, 
who runs a route towards the sideline and 
got enough separation to get into the end 
zone.
Most Indiana players, sticking to their 
assignments, seemed to have no idea what 
was happening as the play developed, 
and the Spartans had plenty of blockers 
for those that came over. It didn’t 
help that one Hoosier, attempting 
to block a kick that never came, fell 
down and was out of commission 
for the rest of the play. Indiana’s No. 
28 appears to have anticipated that 
Lewerke could keep the ball, but 
he wasn’t expecting the pitch and 
hesitated as Coghlin coasted into 
the end zone.
This play was very well executed, 
and clearly caught Indiana off 
guard. But it probably wouldn’t 
work as well with a longer distance to go, 
and even with no defenders in the area, 
Coghlin looked, well, like a kicker trying 
to handle the ball. It’s easy to see Lewerke 
mistiming his pitch or Coghlin bobbling 
the ball, and a fumble that close to the end 
zone could be disastrous. 
Against a bad team like last year’s 
Hoosiers, why not throw this one out? 
But Dantonio may want to try something 
lower risk against a better team like 
the Wolverines, where every scoring 

opportunity counts.
“Opportunities presented themselves,” 
Partridge said of Michigan State’s fakes. 
“They’re not going out there, and I know 
people are saying, ‘Hey, their trick plays,’ 
they’re not going out there doing crazy 
stuff for no reason. When you watch their 
fakes, they’re executing them because 
the 
opportunity 
presents itself for 
what 
the 
other 
team is doing.”
The 
double-
reverse pass
The opponent: 
Michigan
The 
down: 
2nd-and-goal, 
Michigan 4
The situation: 
Third 
quarter, 
down 7-0
You probably remember this play, 
and you probably remember that people 
called it the “Sparty Special” due to its 
resemblance to the famed “Philly Special.”
In reality, this isn’t quite the Philly 
Special. In that play, the ball was snapped 
directly to a running back.
Here, Lewerke lines up under center 
as if to run a normal play. He pitches it to 
running back LJ Scott (No. 3), who pitches 
it on a reverse to wide receiver Darrell 
Stewart (No. 25) running in the opposite 
direction.
If that wasn’t enough trickery for you, 
Stewart throws the ball back to Lewerke, 
who runs a corner route to the edge of 
the end zone after pitching the ball.
It’s clear here that Michigan has no 
idea what was going on. The Wolverines 
are in man coverage, and you can see 
most of the secondary move to the top of 
your screen when Lewerke pitches the 
ball, expecting a run play. Cornerback 
David Long (No. 22) sees Lewerke wide 
open and runs to cover him, but as Long 
originally lined up on the other side of 
the play, he doesn’t get there in time, 
and the rest of the defense is even more 
belated.
This was the Spartans’ only touchdown in 
a game Michigan won, 21-7. It’s quite possible, 
maybe even expected, that Michigan State 
will try a play like this again if it gets in the 
red zone. After all, the Spartans’ offense 
has struggled, and the Wolverines’ defense 
is one of the best in the country. Michigan 
State’s best chance will be to get weird.
Nevertheless, 
Michigan 
knows 
as 
much as anyone that against Dantonio 
and the Spartans, they should expect the 
unexpected.
“You look at everything that the team 
has done in terms of fakes or misdirection, 
deceptive types of plays, what they’ve done 
and then prepare for that,” Harbaugh said. 
“But also, what is a possible complement to 
something they’ve already done we could 
be working on, we could be practicing?”

HANDCRAFTED

M

y Uber driver last weekend didn’t 
care about Michigan or Michigan 
State.
His son goes to Indiana, he explained, 
so he’s a Hoosiers fan with no real 
connection to either in-state school. 
Naturally, though, 
the conversation still 
drifted to this game, 
because that’s what 
happens in this state.
Instantly, his tone 
changed: Well, yeah, 
of course I care about 
the Michigan State 
game. He’ll be root-
ing for Michigan, he 
explained, without 
providing a reason.
To me, the uninitiated out-of-state kid, 
that still seems weird. Because on paper, 
this game doesn’t really matter.
I know that’s not 100 percent accurate. 
For the Wolverines, a loss would end any 
faint hopes at a New Years’ Six Bowl. For 
Michigan State, it could be the difference 
between the Quick Lane Bowl and the 
Pinstripe Bowl — both worthy succes-
sors to its prestigious 2018 RedBox Bowl 
appearance.
But around these parts, none of that is 
the talking point. Eight Michigan players 
and three coaches were made available 
to the media this week. The sole question 
about the Wolverines’ Big Ten title hopes 
was instantly struck down.
There’s seemingly universal agreement 
that Michigan is going to win, but that’s 
not the talking point either. The Wolver-
ines are favored by 13.5, the type of line 
more befitting of a game against Purdue 
or Illinois than one against the Spartans 
— and more importantly, the type of game 
Jim Harbaugh has never lost at Michigan.
By pure loss probability, it ranks a dis-
tant fifth behind trips to Wisconsin and 
Penn State and visits from Notre Dame 
and Iowa. The lead-up to each of those 
Saturdays brought legitimate suspense, 
and subsequent dissection of the Wolver-
ines’ strengths and weaknesses.
This week has provided none of that. 
On paper, it isn’t as important as any of 
those top-25 bouts. And yet, this ostensi-
bly meaningless game is Michigan’s most 
important since last November.
Just ask Harbaugh: “Most important 
game of the season — it’s our next game, 
and it’s huge, big game. I think everybody 
would share those feelings.”
Or Ambry Thomas: “You come to 
Michigan to play in this game right here 
and that team down there in Ohio. You 
come to Michigan to play in these two 
games.”
Or even Aidan Hutchinson: “Obviously, 
Michigan State (is) our biggest rival — or, 
maybe our biggest rival.”
You get the point.

It’s a point that was instantly ham-
mered home Monday afternoon, the 
second I walked into Schembechler Hall, 
even before Harbaugh took to the podi-
um. Where there are usually six or seven 
cameras lined behind the media seats, 
this week required two rows. As players 
later spoke in scrums, reporters lined up 
three or four deep.
None of this, on the surface, should 
have come as a surprise. This isn’t my 
first rivalry week and I remember the 
similarly-sized swarms that preceded last 
year’s rivalry games.
It shouldn’t have caught me off guard 
when Thomas said, “It’s about who’s the 
big brother and who’s the little sister in 
this state” given the similar hysteria sur-
rounding last year’s game.
It shouldn’t have been a surprise when 
I was sitting in the Starbucks on State 
Street and overheard a kid telling some-
one on the phone that he couldn’t come 
home this weekend “because it’s Michi-
gan State.” After all, it was just two years 
ago that I was offered $200 for my ticket 
to see John O’Korn take on the Spartans 
in the driving rain.
But all of it still seems just a little bit 
strange.
Each of the past two matchups car-
ried the tangible notion of championship 
hopes for Michigan, against a Spartans 
team with a pulse. For an out-of-stater 
like myself, I suppose there was some 
ingrained assumption that the hype was 
correlated with how much the actual 
game mattered.
But then again, I’m from the part of the 
country where the notion that this game 
matters as much as the Ohio State game 
would seem absurd. The part of the coun-
try known as, ‘Not Michigan.’
This week, that’s the lesson I’m learn-
ing.
All it took to cement it was a conversa-
tion with my girlfriend, who’s lived in 
Michigan her whole life. Every year dur-
ing this game, she’ll get a text from her 
dad with a picture of him decked out in 
maize and blue. Her sister — a Michigan 
State grad — gets a picture from him, too, 
but hers is green and white.
So this week, I had her ask her family 
group chat who’s rooting for who. Her 
mom’s response was swift: Michigan. Her 
dad, as of this writing, is still evading the 
question. Inside, she knows it’s Michigan 
State. Just another person to trash talk if 
Michigan wins and hide from if they lose.
It’s a small snapshot of why this game 
matters so much, an explanation for the 
hysteria surrounding a matchup with a 
4-5 opponent.
It’s also what makes this rivalry so 
great.
