After meeting with a group 

of student government leaders 
at the Cube Monday, University 
of Michigan president Mark 
Schlissel 
discussed 
his 

administration’s response to 
anti-Black, 
anti-Muslim 
and 

anti-LGBTQ posters discovered 
over the past week.

Last Monday, anti-Black and 

anti-women posters were found 
in University buildings. Today, 
more offensive posters were 
found posted around campus 
from 
the 
white-supremacist 

group alt-right.

Speaking specifically to the 

meeting that was occurring, 

Schlissel told The Michigan 
Daily he wanted to bring 
together student leaders in an 
effort to continue the actions the 
University is taking in response 
to last week’s incidents.

“We were struck by another 

round of these terrible, racist, 
hateful posters, and I’m trying 
to look for proactive things 
that we can do together as a 
community to speak out against 
hate,” Schlissel said. “It’s really 
important to me that the student 
body as a whole pays attention 
to this and appreciates what’s 
going on and steps up to support 
students that feel like their place 
here is being attacked.”

Over the past week, students 

have initiated a series of protests 

Former President Bill Clinton 

visited Flint Monday afternoon 
to campaign for Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton, highlighting her policy 
proposals 
on 
the 
economy 

and 
college 
affordability. 

Approximately 500 people filled 
the University of Michigan-
Flint’s Northbank Center to 
hear Clinton speak.

Michigan has received a fair 

amount of attention from both 
campaigns this election with 
recent visits from Republican 
presidential nominee Donald 
Trump, 
Chelsea 
Clinton, 

Democratic 
vice-presidential 

nominee 
Tim 
Kaine 
and 

Anne Holton, former Virginia 
secretary of education and wife 
of Kaine.

In his remarks, Bill Clinton 

said the most significant item 
to emerge from the Democratic 
National 
Convention 
this 

year were updates to Hillary 
Clinton’s 
higher 
education 

reform plan, the New College 
Compact, influenced by her 
primary opponent Sen. Bernie 
Sanders’ (I–Vt.).

“You’ve got to make college 

affordable,” he said. “The most 
important thing that happened 
at the Democratic Convention 
was the new plan that was 
agreed upon by Senator Sanders 
and Hillary Clinton.”

The new plan incorporates 

aspects 
of 
Sanders’ 
higher 

education 
plan 
by 
making 

public universities tuition-free 
for students from families who 
make less than $125,000 per 
year.

He also dedicated much of his 

speech to outlining the various 
aspects of Hillary Clinton’s 
economic plan, including her 
focus on small businesses and 
manufacturing. He charged that 
Trump’s plan would serve to 
only benefit the rich.

“Her opponent wants to go 

back to trickle-down economics 
on steroids,” he said. “It’s the 
same old story with tax cuts for 
billionaires.”

For many attendees, the fact 

that Clinton had visited the city 
was the most important aspect 
of his speech. On the Republican 
side, some attention has also 
been paid to Flint. Trump 
visited the city in September; 
however, he encountered a 

colder 
reception. 
Michigan 

Attorney General Bill Schuette 
also spoke at the Republican 
National Convention in July 
where he stated his goal of 
obtaining justice for Flint.

The Flint water crisis has 

been an issue that Hillary 
Clinton has repeatedly said to 
be of high importance to her. 
She first highlighted the issue 
during a Democratic debate in 

Ahead 
of 
Tuesday’s 
vice 

presidential 
debate 
between 

Sen. Tim Kaine (D–Va.) and Gov. 
Mike Pence (R–Ind.), education 
stands out in the records of both 
running mates and could draw 
student interest in the event.

In a Michigan Daily poll of 

University of Michigan students, 
higher education reform was 
recognized 
as 
an 
important 

issue for voters, with 26 percent 
of respondents citing higher 
education 
reform 
as 
being 

“extremely important” to them 
and 35.1 percent responding it is 
“very important.” 59.7 percent of 
respondents also said they prefer 
a “debt-free” college reform plan 
and another 18.8 percent said 
they prefer a “tuition-free” plan.

On the campaign trail, Pence 

has cited his yearly budget 
investments in education as the 
largest ever in his home state 
of Indiana, while Kaine has 
highlighted his continued work 
in the Senate to secure $9.5 
million in education funding in 
his home state of Virginia, as well 
as his wife Anne Holton’s work in

Dr. Amir Ganjavie talks about censorship and portrayal of sexuality in Iranian filmography in a lecture on campus Monday.

The portrayal of women in 

Iranian cinema is limited, Amir 
Ganjavie, a communication and 
culture Ph.D. student at York 
University in Toronto, said at 
a talk Monday night on love, 

intimacy and eroticism in the 
genre.

At its first lecture series of 

the semester, the Department 
of Near Eastern Studies hosted 
Ganjavie, a cultural critic and 
Iranian film connoisseur who 
has written for publications 
such 
as 
BBC 
Persian 
and 

Senses of Cinema and Cameron 

Cross, Iranian Studies Prof. at 
the University of Michigan to 
discuss Ganjavie’s work on the 
utopic visions of national cinema 
and how intimacy is portrayed 
in Iranian films.

Ganjavie began his lecture 

with a brief history of how 
women came to be depicted in 
Iranian films noting this the 

Pahlavi Dynasty, which ruled 
Iran until 1979, encouraged 
filmmakers to make women 
objects of affection. However, 
after the Islamic Revolution 
of 1979, a whole new range of 
restrictions 
were 
levied 
on 

the Iranian film industry by 
the government, with women

A new set of alt right posters 

were found Monday morning 
on a University of Michigan 
cylinder posting area on the 
corner of South State Street 
and North University, citing 
websites 
that 
argue 
race 

determines 
intelligence 
and 

anti-Muslim sentiments.

One of the posters featured 

the Pepe the Frog meme, a 
newfound symbol associated 
with the alt right movement. 
Several others portrayed an 
Islam man killing a white 
woman or characterizing the 
LGBTQ community as a target 

of violence by members of the 
Muslim community.

Rackham 
student 
Austin 

McCoy, 
a 
humanities 

postdoctoral 
fellow 
at 
the 

University who found several 
of the posters on campus, said 
he thought the posters gave 
quiet sympathizers a reason 
to continue to harass minority 
groups.

“I think at least when it 

comes to these flyers and 
these messages, they’re not 
just beyond hurtful, they’re 
violent,” McCoy said. “Or they 
insinuate other groups, such 
as LGBTQ folks or women, are 
naive. If these ideas continue 
to enter into the mainstream, 
eventually, someone else who 

sympathizes with these ideas 
might act on them.”

These posters follow a week 

of protest and discussion at the 
University in response to three 
types 
of 
anti-Black 
posters 

found hung up in Mason and 
Haven Hall last week. One 
of the posters included an 
explanation of “race differences 
in intelligence” and “reasons 
why women shouldn’t date 
Black men”.

In 
a 
statement 
from 

the 
University 
last 
week, 

administrators condemned the 
fliers, saying that kind of speech 
was not consistent with campus 
values. As of Monday afternoon, 
the University had not released 
a statement on the new fliers. 

University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald did not immediately 
reply to a request for comment 
Monday afternoon.

In remarks to the Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

Undergraduate 
Affairs 
last 

week, 
University 
Provost 

Martha Pollack noted that while 
the University condemned the 
speech, they were unable to 
remove fliers posted in posting 
kiosks, such as the Mason Hall 
posting wall.

Over the past week, both 

students 
and 
administrators 

have organized multiple campus 
events in response to the fliers 
and a previously planned debate 
over the merits of the Black

Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks speaks at a live recorded show in the Rogel Ballroom of the Michigan Union Monday. 
The Young Turks is a left-wing political commentary network with a show airing on Fusion for the 2016 election cycle.

THE YOUNG TURK S

University 
of 
Michigan 

students 
and 
the 
campus 

community 
wrote 
messages 

of hope on wooden tiles for an 
installation aiming to shed light on 
suicide and mental health issues 
on the Diag Monday morning.

Christine 
Asidao, 
associate 

director 
of 
community 

engagement and outreach for 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services said the two-hour event, 
titled Hope on the Diag, aimed 
to humanize the issue of suicide 
instead of talking about it through 
statistics.

“(CAPS) 
has 
always 
done 

suicide prevention work, but a 

few years ago a few of us had 
individual stories where someone 
we knew had died of suicide,” 
Asidao said. “We really talked 
about the importance of more 
‘heart’ messages as opposed to 
just the data that’s shared about 
suicide.”

Asidao said the event has been 

a regular feature of CAPS for the 
past few years.

LSA 
sophomore 
Mayur 

Bandekar, who said he lost an 
acquaintance to suicide before 
the school year began, was at 
a loss of words as he faced the 
wooden tiles, but still wanted to 
send a positive message to those 
who suffer from depression.

“I don’t know what to say, 

dude,” Bandekar said. “But you 
should always remember that 
everything’s gonna be OK no 
matter how bad it is right now, 
no matter how dark your place 
is right now, everything will 
always be OK. You just gotta 
always push through.”

Hope on the Diag also 

featured a booth run by the 
Silence Shoot, a Lansing-based 
project that supports victims 
of bullying and depression 
through photography. Matthew 
Bryan 
Pruitt, 
founder 
and 

photographer at the Silence 
Shoot, started the project five 
years ago as a way to bring a 
sense of unity to his younger 
brother 
and 
sister, 
who 

were bullied to the point of 
contemplating suicide.

reduced to more inferior roles 
and limited in the interactions 
they could have with men on 
screen.

“The 
new 
authorities 

showed hostility to women’s 
participation 
in 
cinema, 

which is seen in the guidelines 
that they wrote codifying the 
representation of women in 
the films,” Ganjavie said.

The post-1979 Iranian film 

industry also adjusted to 
the guidelines by changing 
how intimacy and a woman’s 
role in society were — in a 
way that was often discreet 
and based upon traditional 
Iranian culture.

“Poetry is used to depict 

eroticism and there are many 
similar approaches used by 
Iranian directors,” Ganjavie 
said. “Iranian cinema is very 
indebted to and was shaped 
by poetry.”

To illustrate his point, 

Ganjavie showed a clip from 
the 1999 film “The Wind 
Will Carry Us” in which a 
man uses poetry to show his 
affection for a woman.

Given the restrictions on 

physical contact, symbolism 
has become a central part 
of how Iranian cinema in 
general 
conveys 
moments 

of intimacy, according to 
Ganjavie.

For Art & Design alum 

Parisa Ghaderi, an Ann Arbor 
resident, the lecture provided 

insight into how symbols 
can be a powerful tool in 
describing love between two 
people.

“I think it was interesting 

for me to kind of decode 
the imagery he was talking 
about,” 
Ghaderi 
said. 
“I 

remember I was thinking 
about these concepts before, 
but he helped decode all of 
this imagery and now I will 
try to see what the approach 
is of a director is to show love 
scenes.”

Ganjavie 
said 

understanding how Iranian 
cinema 
tackles 
issues 
of 

intimacy 
can 
provide 
a 

lens to better understand 
how notions of love are 
perpetrated in American and 
European films. Hollywood, 
he said, has an outsized 
ability to craft the ways in 
which people interpret these 
acts of intimacy taking place.

“Contrary to the common 

belief 
that 
kissing 
is 
a 

universal desire, a majority 
of cultures do not accept it as 
a common way of expressing 
emotion,” Ganjavie said.

Cross said he found this 

point, and Ganjavie’s lecture 
as a whole, to be a useful 
thesis on how cinema is a 
powerful tool beyond being a 
medium of entertainment.

“Cinema is a very useful 

way to talk about culture and 
art and thoughts in general, 
regardless of whether it is 
Iranian culture or another 
area of the world,” he said.

January, followed by visits from 
her, her daughter and President 
Barack 
Obama. 
Flint 
Mayor 

Karen Weaver also received a 
speaking spot at the Democratic 
National Convention in July.

UM-Flint 
freshman 
Abbey 

Johnson said she believes Bill 
Clinton’s 
visit 
is 
significant 

because it demonstrates that the 
Clintons care about issues facing 
everyday Americans.

“I think it’s really important 

that he came here,” she said. 
“With the Flint water crisis, it 
shows not only the Democrats 
but everyone that he really cares 
and that Hillary cares what is 
happening all over the country, 
especially in Flint.”

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Flint) 

said Hillary Clinton helped Flint 
gain the national attention it 
needed to help resolve the crisis.

“During the middle of the New 

Hampshire 
primary, 
Hillary 

Clinton left New Hampshire, put 
politics aside and came to the aid 
of the people of Flint,” he said. 
“She elevated this case, our story, 
to the national prominence that it 
deserved.”

Kildee also pointed to the 

Water Resources Development 
Act 
passed 
in 
the 
House 

last Wednesday, which is an 
amendment 
providing 
$170 

million in federal funding for 
Flint.

During Weaver’s introduction 

of Bill Clinton, she said Flint is 
privileged to have remained in 
the purview of a former president.

“How excited can Flint be to 

have never, ever been forgotten 
by 
this 
two-term 
elected 

Democratic president,” she said.

Though Michigan has not voted 

for a Republican presidential 
candidate since 1988, both parties 
have expressed the importance of 
the Michigan as a battleground 
state in this election. The most 
recent RealClearPolitics polling 
average has Clinton 5.3 points 
ahead of Trump in the state, one 
of her lower polling numbers in 
Michigan since March.

In acknowledgement of that, 

Bill Clinton closed with a request 
for the audience to register voters 
and encourage people to vote 
for Hillary Clinton as the Oct. 
11 voter registration deadline 
approaches.

“You’ve got a week and a day 

to register new voters,” he said. 
“You’ve got to go and talk to your 
friends and neighbors.”

“It would be nice at times if 

we could speak more quickly,” 
Schultz said. “We’ve already 
done a little bit of that through 
our Twitter account, which 
did get a fair number of hits. 
Maybe if we did more, we’d get 
more hits.”

Prof. Silke-Maria Weineck, 

LSA representative on the 
committee, 
praised 
Central 

Student 
Government’s 

response to the flyers and set 
its public statement response 
times as a goal for SACUA to 
strive for.

“I brought up the rapid 

response 
question 
(on 
the 

agenda),” 
Weineck 
said. 

“What 
concerned 
me 
was 

that when the story broke 
in 
The 
Washington 
Post, 

they mentioned that Central 
Student 
Government 
had 

issued a statement condemning 
the posters and flyers. … It 
took until Friday for our email 
message to arrive.”

Many 
members 
of 
the 

committee, noted they were 
not very fluent with social 
media lexicon or the scope 
of Twitter, though they also 
expressed a desire to learn 
if it would help decrease the 
committee’s response time.

Prof. 
Stefan 
Szymanski, 

committee member from the 

School of Kinesiology, stressed 
the importance of an effective 
and consistent plan for social 
media and suggested that the 
item be addressed in future 
meetings of SACUA and the 
Senate 
Assembly. 
Senate 

Assembly the overall faculty 
body that meets once a month.

After 
discussing 
rapid 

response, 
SACUA 
also 

talked about a Tri-Campus 
Governance 
Resolution 

written 
by 
Prof 
Lehman, 

committee member for LSA. 
Schultz noted that UM-Flint 
History Prof. John Ellis and 
Robert Fraser, former SACUA 
board member and current 
associate director for graduate 
programs 
at 
UM-Dearborn, 

came to the SACUA board last 
week asking for support in 
developing the “relationship 
of the faculty as a whole and 
the regional campuses’ central 
governments.”

Wright said he saw the 

resolution as an effort to get 
the University to strengthen 
its relationship with UM-Flint 
and 
UM-Dearborn, 
instead 

of primarily addressing the 
concerns 
they 
originally 

came to SACUA with about 
their own campuses. At a 
previous 
SACUA 
meeting, 

faculty from the Flint campus 
expressed 
concerns 
with 

the lack of transparancy the 
administration has with the 
faculty. 

“The 
two 
issues 
are 

‘Are 
their 
internal 
faculty 

governing systems working or 
dysfunctional?’, then the other 
issue is the relationship with 
us, with the Senate Assembly 
on campus,” Wright said. “If I 
go back about three different 
times in their revision, they 
inserted that second issue to 
study the relationship with 
us.”

Lehman 
said 
what 
he 

heard at the meeting with the 
petitioners was not all that was 
reflected in their edits to his 
resolution.

“When I listened to the guys 

at Flint around the table, they’re 
basically saying, ‘We’d like to 
have some type of an outside 
look at what’s happening here 
with fresh pairs of eyes to help 
us calibrate ourselves, quite 
frankly, as to whether or not 
we really are being abused 
to the degree we think we’re 
being abused and whether or 
not the administration is really 
running counter to the rules,’ 
” Lehman said. “That’s what 
I took out of what they were 
saying.”

Syzmanski, 
regardless 

of how it came to be in the 
resolution, said he saw the 
relationship between the three 
campuses as something worth 
addressing.

“I don’t think we should 

preempt the discussion by 
saying, ‘Well we’re not going 
to even include this in the 
resolution,’ ” Syzmanski said. 
“It should be somewhere in the 
commission.”

Lives Matter movement.

On Monday and Tuesday, 

large student protests drew 
over 600, with many calling 
for the University to take more 
immediate action to resolve 
climate issues and criticizing 
the 
University’s 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion initiative. 
The initiative, a year-long effort 

to create a strategic plan for 
diversity on campus, is slated to 
launch on Thursday.

Both the College of LSA and 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel also hosted events in 
response to the posters during 
the week, which drew close to 
three hundred students total.

During the forum he hosted 

Sunday, Schlissel told students 
he thinks the success of his 
presidency depends on his DEI 
plan and improving the racial 

climate on campus.

McCoy 
said 
for 
him, 

responding to the newest fliers 
means supporting the other 
minority groups being targeted.

“Whoever has been posting 

these 
fliers, 
they’ve 
said 

something to us and many 
different groups of people,” he 
said. “So I think at this point, 
it’s supporting everyone who’s 
affected and everyone who’s 
offended in whatever way I can.”

POSTERS
From Page 2

“I feel like if someone is being 

bullied, or anything really, and 
they feel lonely, that is the quickest 
way that they would commit 
suicide,” Pruitt said. “So my hopes 
in the photos is that it creates a 
sense of unity with people that 
have thought of suicide or have 
been bullied and so that people 
that think they are alone … their 
feelings go away.” 

Silence Shoot’s photographs are 

each in black and white, except for 
a piece of red tape that covers the 
subject’s mouth. Pruitt said the 
tape represents the forced silence 
of victims of bullying, but also 
represents survivors and allies that 
stand together against bullying.

Silence Shoot, which tours 

around 
college 
campuses 
in 

Michigan to spread awareness, will 
post the photos on their website 
and Facebook page.

A 
Nursing 
freshman 
who 

requested to go by only her first 
name, Kat, said she wrote “You’re 
Loved” on the wooden tile to share 
with others the feeling that got her 
through her own depression.

“We always all have the thought 

that ‘If I die, will people remember 
me? Could I just disappear and 
nobody would notice?’ ” Kat said. 
“What people don’t realize is that 
they are loved, and there’s so many 
people there for them. And if they 
just let somebody know that they’re 
having a bad day, someone will 
always be there to help you. And 
that’s what friends and family are 
for.”

SILENCE
From Page 2

and social media campaigns 
following the discovery of the 
original posters last week, with 
many calling for more action from 
Schlissel and noting his absence 
at some of the events. According 
to University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald, Schlissel was out of 
town last Monday.

The protests and incidents 

came a week before the launch of 
the University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion strategic plan, a 
year-long initiative launched by 
Schlissel last September, which 
was also a target of criticism 
during protests.

On 
Monday 
evening, 

chalkings on the Diag criticizing 
Schlissel for his response to 
protests 
and 
student 
outcry 

appeared, including “Schlissel 
don’t care about Black Students 
unless 
They 
Are 
Athletes,” 

“We just getting started Mark” 
and 
“#Schlisselwya,” 
which 

referenced a hashtag started 
earlier in the week.

The 
University 
has 
held 

several events in response to the 
fliers this past week, including a 
LSA-sponsored event Wednesday 
and a campus-wide conversation 

about race hosted by Schlissel on 
Sunday. Both events discussed 
the importance of continuing 
conversations surrounding these 
issues, aiming to foster student 
discussion and input.

In his conversation with the 

Daily Monday, Schlissel stressed 
the need for proactive efforts to 
tackle the incidents.

He said he thinks the launch of 

the DEI plan, along with faculty 
members 
encouraging 
open 

dialogue in the classroom setting, 
will help establish campus-wide 
solidarity and communication.

“The comments I plan to 

make (upon launching the DEI 
plan) will be modified based 
on the challenging things that 
have been going on on campus 
the last 10 days,” Schlissel said. 
“One of our hopes is that faculty 
members take advantage or try to 
come up with something positive 
out of this difficult circumstance 
and are talking to their students 
and asking how they feel about 
things and providing support for 
them. I know that the faculty are 
thinking of ways to step forward 
as a group as well.”

Schlissel 
also 
noted 
that 

the University is not alone in 
these incidents, as there have 
been others on campuses both 
statewide and nationwide. On 

Sept. 20, EMU found that racially 
charged slurs were graffitied on 
several academic and student 
housing buildings, leading to a 
call for response from university 
officials.

“We 
all 
face 
the 
same 

challenges, we all face the same 
limitations as to response and I 
think we’re all looking for ways 
to show solidarity with our 
students and to fight hate speech 
with more speech,” Schlissel 
said.

CSG President David Schafer, 

an LSA senior, was present at 
the meeting and said it was a 
significant way to move forward 
from the incidents.

Schafer also said he thought 

while social media campaigns 
are a strong start to responding to 
these events, much like Schlissel, 
he wants to see tangible action 
in engaging with a variety of 
student groups to ensure the 
safety and welfare of all students.

“It’s more than students just 

posting or tweeting on Facebook 
or over social media, I think 
it’s being an ally through their 
actions, as we mentioned in our 
statement a couple of Fridays 
ago,” Schafer said. “Now we need 
to match words with actions.”

LSA 
senior 
Julia 
Gips, 

president 
of 
LSA 
Student 

Government, 
said 
she 
does 

not think many students have 
engaged fully with the incidents 
over the past few weeks, but that 
the efforts the administration is 
taking so far — especially those 
on social media — have been 
effective.

“I think, as student leaders, 

we hope to get other students 
involved in the conversation 
and not just walk past these 
posters and feel appalled, but 
do something about it, say 
something and stand up for our 
fellow classmates,” Gips said.

The chalkings were found the 

same day anti-Muslim and sexist 
posters were found on campus, 
believed to be from a white 
supremacist alt-right group.

These controversies have been 

occurring on campus just days 
before the launch of Schlissel’s 
campus-wide Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan Oct. 6.

At the time of the chalkings, 

Schlissel was meeting with about 
about six students involved in 
student government efforts on 
campus at the Cube. CSG and 
Schlissel were taking photos for a 
social media post and statement 
to be released Monday night, 
stating their goals of showing 
solidarity for students affected 
by the postings.

SCHLISSEL

reducing the cost of education 
as secretary of education in 
Virginia.

During 
Kaine’s 
September 

campaign stop at the University, 
debt-free college was also a 
central theme of his speech. He 
also emphasized the contrast 
between 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

education plan and a lack of a 
specific platform from Donald 
Trump on higher education.

Pence has yet to tout a college 

plan, and the Trump campaign 
has not released specific policy 
on it. Howeer, he has placed a 
particular focus on education in 
Indiana, encouraging students 
to enroll in technical schools, 
expanding school of choice and 
opposing 
federally 
mandated 

Common 
Core 
education 

standards.

Kaine, in contrast, supported 

Virginia’s 
participation 
in 

following 
Common 
Core 

standards in 2009 when he was 
governor.

Among 
students, 
though, 

interest in higher education 
policy was high. The influence 
the 
candidates’ 
records 
are 

expected to have on their votes 
varied.

LSA junior James Margard 

said the choice of vice presidential 
candidate has a minor influence 
on the way he will vote in 
November. However, he said 
he is not planning on watching 

Tuesday’s 
debate 
because 
a 

debate because he is focusing on 
the presidential candidates.

“I 
am 
not 
planning 
on 

watching the vice presidential 
debate because I already know 
who I’m voting for,” Margard 
said. “I’m voting for the president 
rather than the vice president.”

Margard added that while 

he thought higher education 
reform was important, he thinks 
there are bigger issues facing the 
country in this election.

Aaron Kall, the University’s 

director of debate, said the 
moderator 
may 
agree 
with 

Margard’s sentiments. He said 
he isn’t sure whether education 
will be a topic at the debate, given 
all of the other controversies 
surrounding 
both 
campaigns 

and the autonomy of debate 
moderator Elaine Quijano in 
formulating the debate questions.

“Nobody really knows; the 

moderator has autonomy over 
all the questions,” Kall said. 
“It’s really anybody’s guess as to 
what is of her (Quijano’s) major 
concern.”

Kall 
also 
noted 
vice 

presidential 
debates 
usually 

have 
smaller 
viewership 
in 

comparison 
to 
presidential 

debates, and typically have a 
small amount of influence on 
people’s choice of candidate.

“It’s one debate that provides a 

good news cycle, but historically 
hasn’t had an overall major 
impact on the race,” Kall said. 
“There have been some very 
highly rated debates with a lot 

of viewer interest, but none that 
had a real major impact on the 
outcome of the race.”

LSA sophomore Sunji Nam 

also said she the effect the debate 
would have on her vote. She noted 
that though she self-finances 
part of her own education, she 
disagrees with the concept of 
tuition-free college and doesn’t 
think higher education reform is 
the most important issue in this 
presidential election. However, 
she added that she believes 
tonight’s debate has the power to 
influence voters.

“Normally 
I 
don’t 
think 

the 
vice 
presidential 
debate 

is 
important, 
but 
it 
could 

be this year given Trump’s 
unpopularity,” Nam said.

Kall echoed these sentiments, 

saying that if Pence is polished 
and puts on a good showing, it 
could allow Trump to bounce 
back from a negative debate 
and news week in which his 
unreleased tax returns have 
dominated headlines.

“It’s a good opportunity for the 

Trump campaign to kind of stop 
the bleeding,” Kall said. “If Pence 
can have a positive performance, 
then that could consume the 
news cycle in the run-up to the 
next debate on Sunday as opposed 
to all the negative attention that 
is currently on Trump.”

The debate will air at 9 p.m. 

tonight on major cable news 
networks as well as C-SPAN, and 
will be 90 minutes long with no 
commercial breaks.

DEBATE
From Page 1

KEVIN ZHENG/Daily

Accounting Prof. Dave Wright at the Senate Advisory Committee meeting Monday.


L

ast Monday, I had the 
pleasure 
of 
watching 

what 
may 
very 
well 

be the fall of Western liberal 
democracy. 
No, 
not 
the 

newest episode of 
“Keeping Up with 
the 
Kardashians,” 

rather, 
the 

presidential debate. 
I 
went 
into 
the 

debate with a deep 
fear Donald Trump 
could 
rehabilitate 

his image among the 
American 
public. 

Hillary 
Clinton’s 

seven-point 
lead 

over the summer 
had evaporated to the margin of 
error. If Trump had acted like a 
functioning adult for the entire 
debate he could have captured 
the vote of the undecided voters, 
swinging the race.

Fortunately, that’s not what 

happened. Trump was Trump 
and had a YUGE* breakdown 
after 15 minutes. Afterward, I 
was discussing the rout with 
a number of my friends, and 
someone claimed it was the most 
devastating debate since the 
Nixon-Kennedy debate in 1960.

As the apocryphon goes, John 

F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon’s 
debate hinged on makeup. The 
debate was the first one to ever 
be televised and Kennedy was 
prepared. He wore makeup to 
maintain his legendary good 
looks under the debate set’s 
harsh lighting. Nixon, on the 
other hand, had decided that 
getting dolled up for the debate 
was too feminine a proposition 
for him.

The results? Nixon melted 

Wicked-Witch-of-the-West 
style and viewers gravitated 
toward Kennedy, who kept 
both 
physical 
and 
mental 

composure against the then-
vice president. The final twist 
was that people who listened to 
the debate on the radio thought 
that Nixon’s ideas were better 
and were more likely to support 
him. It wasn’t that Nixon 
did poorly, per se, but rather 

audiences had different ideas of 
what constitutes a good debate 
performance depending on if 
they listened to or watched it.

This parable aptly describes 

how difficult it was 
to 
assess 
Trump’s 

debate 
performance, 

especially 
to 
an 

undecided voter. This 
goes 
beyond 
mere 

partisan 
differences. 

Of course there are 
going to be adherents 
who will crown their 
party’s candidate the 
winner no matter what.

As an aside, I found 

it 
interesting 
that 

what were once big applause 
lines for Bernie Sanders about 
the failings of NAFTA were 
points of heckling for Trump. 
I think this speaks to Trump’s 
sheer unpopularity with college 
students. I don’t know what 
a man dying sounds like but 
social death probably sounds 
something like, “You know, I 
really think Trump has a point 
there.”

Trump is so hard to assess 

as a debater because of the 
singular nature of his politics. 
I find his comments about 
Mexicans to be deplorable and 
they should have disqualified 
him from the presidency from 
day one. However, many of 
his 
supporters 
find 
these 

comments 
refreshing; 
they 

believe Trump is speaking the 
unvarnished 
truth. 
Indeed, 

one 
of 
the 
most 
common 

compliments given to Trump 
is that he speaks his mind. In 
essence, he’s flipped the idea of 
what constitutes negative news 
coverage on its head. I recall 
reading 
an 
interview 
with 

a Trump supporter several 
months ago. When the subject 
was 
pressed 
on 
Trump’s 

racism, he claimed that he 
wasn’t bothered by it and 
that those comments weren’t 
made 
for 
people 
like 
the 

reporter anyway. “People like 
the reporter” being college-
educated liberals, e.g., me. In 

essence, this is what makes 
it tough to parse out what is 
divisive news coverage and 
what is categorically negative.

Not all of Trump’s comments 

bring universal praise among his 
supporters. Over the summer, 
his attacks on the Khans, two 
parents who lost their Medal of 
Honor son in Iraq, caused him 
to lose a lot of support. But I 
wouldn’t have considered the 
opposite effect occurring to be 
outside the realm of possibility.

His style of debating is 

similarly mystifying. The way 
he interrupted Clinton was 
interpreted by many liberal 
commentators to be a plain-
faced 
display 
of 
Trump’s 

misogyny. Yet his supporters 
find his bluster and desire to not 
play by the rules invigorating. 
Similarly, his use of personal 
attacks on Clinton when asked 
about policy issues are hard to 
read. Maybe the undecided voter 
found his responses to those 
questions more compelling than 
a substantive policy description 
would be.

Political 
pundits 
have 

constantly 
misread 
Trump’s 

ascent, claiming it would be 
derailed every step of the way. 
I think part of the reason why 
is they have grown accustomed 
to a certain type of candidate 
who fits their mold of an 
effective debater. I don’t see 
the Trump phenomenon going 
away. The fissures that Trump 
has reopened won’t go away in 
four short years. I’m sure that 
there will be another Trump 
in 2020. This leaves us with 
the question of what to do. We 
can’t answer that question yet, 
but I do believe the only way 
we can understand the next 
Trump’s rise is if we break out 
of our analytic mold of what 
constitutes a good politician.

*I sincerely apologize for 

doing this. These jokes aren’t 
funny anymore.

W

ith more than 84 
million people tuned 
in across the country 

(shattering a record set in 1980), 
Monday night’s first presidential 
debate was already 
posed to be historic. 
Yet, while I sat in 
my 
living 
room, 

actively 
hoping 

for 
a 
substantial 

two-sided 
policy 

debate, 
I 
found 

myself 
growing 

increasingly 
frustrated 
by 
my 

naïveté. 
Instead 

of 
taking 
the 

opportunity to discuss real, 
viable plans, Donald Trump 
gave all 84 million of us more 
meaningless rhetoric.

I endured Trump’s continuous 

interruptions of “wrong!” when 
Hillary Clinton said just about 
anything, rolled my eyes at his 
comment of “that makes me 
smart” when confronted with 
his neglect to pay federal income 
taxes and grew a little red in 
the face when he discussed the 
“small loan” of about $1 million 
he received from his father to 
start his business. But nothing 
infuriated me more than the two 
words Mr. Trump used when 
Lester Holt asked the candidates 
on Monday how they would heal 
the growing racial divide in 
our country: law and order. His 
solution to the systemic racism, 
police shootings, discrimination 
and general intolerance in our 
country is law and order — 
words, not plans.

Holt is absolutely correct: 

Race relations in our country are 
worsening by the day. The recent 
killings of Keith Lamont Scott in 
Charlotte and Terence Crutcher 

in Tulsa sit atop a growing 
list of fatal police shootings of 
unarmed Black men. And while 
there are those who argue, 
correctly, that more white men 

are killed by police 
each year overall, these 
people fail to adjust 
for 
population 
size 

— 62 percent of our 
country is white, while 
13 percent is Black. 
As The Washington 
Post 
found 
in 
its 

recent study, “Black 
Americans 
are 
2.5 

times as likely as white 
Americans to be shot 

and killed by police officers.” 
Clearly, 
there 
is 
something 

wrong here.

Clinton 
isn’t 
without 
her 

flaws, but at least she gave us 
real plans to combat racial 
injustice in our nation Monday 
night. She discussed criminal 
justice reform, gun control and 
community-police relationships 
— all important stepping stones 
in helping to heal the divide. 
Taking a look at her website, 
Clinton has entire pages of plans 
to reform the criminal justice 
system, including committing 
$1 billion in her first budget 
to police training to challenge 
implicit 
bias, 
bettering 
the 

enforcement of the Voting Rights 
Act and contining a push for gun 
violence prevention — including 
eliminating 
the 
“Charleston 

Loophole” — to name but a few. 
I scoured Trump’s website and 
found not a single policy position 
on race relations. The closest I 
came to something resembling 
a race-related position was a 
section promising to “get gang 
members and drug dealers off the 
street” in his section regarding 

the Second Amendment.

During the debate Trump 

went 
on 
to 
advocate 
for 

stop-and-frisk 
measures, 

which were indeed declared 
unconstitutional in New York. 
(To be sure, stop and frisk is 
a legal — albeit problematic — 
police tactic, but its application 
was declared unconstitutional 
in New York because it was used 
to 
disproportionately 
affect 

minority groups.) This is no plan 
to help heal the racial divide. 
This is a plan to widen it. To make 
matters worse, when discussing 
the recent shooting and protests 
in Charlotte, he called it, “a 
city I love, a city where I have 
investments.” His interest in 
Charlotte lies within his wallet, 
not in helping the people who are 
hurt, discouraged and angry by 
their current situation.

You may ask how I, a white 

woman, have any right to discuss 
this topic. And you’re right. I 
most likely will never lose a 
brother, a cousin or a father 
at the hands of police. I don’t 
know what it’s like to experience 
systemic racism on a daily 
basis. But I am a human who is 
sickened by the gross abuse and 
mistreatment of other humans. 
And nothing will change if we 
cannot have an open and honest 
discussion about it.

“Law” and “order” are two 

absolutely meaningless words 
used to stir a reaction. We need 
a president who doesn’t just talk. 
We need a president who acts. 
Get out and vote on Nov. 8. It’s 
important.

Meaningless rhetoric

MELISSA STRAUSS | COLUMN

S

ept. 
11, 
2001: 
Vice 

President 
Dick 
Cheney 

is gripping a phone close 

to his ear as he sits within the 
crowded bunker beneath the East 
Wing of the White House. Two 
planes have hit the 
World Trade Center 
— and a third just 
struck the Pentagon. 
On the other end of 
the 
line, 
Secretary 

of 
Defense 
Donald 

Rumsfeld informs the 
vice president he has 
scrambled fighter jets 
above 
Washington 

to 
intercept 
other 

planes still in the air. 
A military aid turns 
to Cheney and asks whether 
the planes should be shot down. 
According to Scooter Libby, chief 
of staff to the vice president, 
“Cheney paused for ‘about the 
time it takes a batter to swing,’ … 
then he answered: Yes.”

After the chaos of that day, 

both Bush and Cheney attempted 
to “correct” the record, stating 
the president communicated the 
order to engage civilian aircraft 
above the skies in Washington. 
Yet many within the bunker of 
the East Wing disavow such 
claims, and Cheney did in fact 
make that call. This distinction 
is important because it marked 
a dynamic between Bush and 
Cheney that lasted the entirety 
of their administration. This 
dynamic was dangerous, and it 
can potentially occur again.

The Cheney vice presidency 

is often regarded as the most 
powerful and influential in U.S. 
history. His role resembled that 
of a co-president who operated 
outside the national spotlight. He 
had virtually unlimited access 
to the Oval Office, where he 
persuaded Bush to allow him to 
handle the more nuanced issues 
of the presidency. Bush didn’t 
like such intricate and political 
details — often wanting only to 
understand the “big picture.”

Cheney’s 
neoconservative 

influence 
shaped 
post-9/11 

America. 
He 
enacted 
the 

controversial 
tax 
cuts, 
the 

enhanced 
interrogation 

program in Guantanamo Bay 
and the constitutionally illegal 
surveillance 
program 
with 

the NSA. He was also a main 
proponent of the invasion of 
Iraq in 2003. His vice presidency 
was shrouded in scandal and, by 

the time of the administration’s 
departure, he carried a 13 percent 
approval rating.

And 
this 
is 
the 
vice 

presidency Gov. Mike Pence 
has decided to model his future 

after. 
“I 
frankly 

hold Dick Cheney in 
really high regard 
in his role as vice 
president and as an 
American,” 
Pence 

told ABC News. But 
unlike Cheney, who 
angled his position 
to better suit his 
power, Pence may 
simply be handed 
authority over the 
country. The New 

York Times revealed Trump’s 
plans on taking a chairman-of-
the-board approach toward the 
presidency, calling for his vice 
president to be in charge of 
“domestic and foreign policy,” 
while 
Trump 
focuses 
on 

“making America great again” 
— whatever that means.

Throughout the entirety of his 

campaign, Trump has displayed 
a lack of knowledge and care 
toward even the simplest of 
issues. He has demonstrated no 
understanding of the nuclear 
triad, the function of NATO or 
actual economic and tax policy. 
This may all be because he has 
no desire to learn or understand. 
He is simply a celebrity riding on 
waves of outrage that guarantee 
constant 
media 
attention. 

His campaign is made up of 
controversial 
interviews 
and 

hosting rallies full of thousands of 
supporters screaming his name. 
But actually running the country 
would be far different from the 
rallies he hosts and celebrity 
status he receives. It would be 
reasonable to imagine Pence 
actively running the country 
as vice president while Trump 
vacations down in Mar-a-Lago.

This would put Pence in a 

position of great power and 
influence operating outside what 
voters truly envisioned. Pence 
doesn’t differ on issues with his 
running mate — he simply has 
the focus and drive to enact his 
own policy. And what exactly 
are the beliefs of Pence, and 
how have these beliefs impacted 
his management of the state of 
Indiana? He believes climate 
change is a myth, doesn’t believe 
in evolution, voted against raising 
the minimum wage, has opposed 

funding to combat AIDS saying 
the money could be better spent 
trying to “cure” homosexuality, 
enacted a law that outright 
banned abortion and waged a 
career-long war against Planned 
Parenthood 
that 
included 

slashing 
their 
funding 
and 

demonizing their organization.

One can imagine a Pence 

vice presidency enacting the 
same 
radically 
conservative 

policies of Indiana on a national 
scale. A Pence vice presidency 
would deny the existence of 
global warming and increase 
the severity of climate change. 
The 
administration 
would 

stand steadfast in opposition 
to raising the minimum wage, 
which would bring a disgusting 
level of income inequality in the 
United States. Pence could push 
to fill the current vacant seat and 
future open seats of the Supreme 
Court with justices in staunch 
opposition to the liberal progress 
our country has made over the last 
50 years. America could witness 
restrictions on a woman’s access 
to contraceptives and abortions, 
reversals on rights ensuring gay 
marriage and further inequality 
for 
transgender 
people. 
The 

country 
could 
witness 
the 

conservative reduction in the 
size of the government until it 
was just small enough to fit in the 
bedroom of every American. 

Americans didn’t know of 

Cheney’s intentions, nor did they 
anticipate his ability to influence 
national policies. He was granted 
carte blanche on matters of 
national security, and enacted 
some of the most controversial 
and damaging policies during his 
tenure. And this occurred under 
the watch of Bush, who didn’t 
intently desire for Cheney to 
have such power, but allowed for 
him to angle his way into greater 
positions of power.

Yet this time, the United 

States is presented with an 
ignorant 
candidate 
whose 

campaign has planned on a vice 
president being in charge of 
“domestic and foreign policy.” 
If our country learned anything 
from the failures of the Cheney-
Bush dynamic, we would see the 
present situation is far worse and 
should be prevented at all costs.

The Altar, R&B artist Banks’s 

newest release, is the very 
embodiment 
of 
post-breakup 

anger, 
vindictive 

stormy skies and 
the entire month 
of October. This 
album is basically 
Lady Macbeth in 
music form, and its 
collection of omi-
nously 
magical, 

deeply 
powerful 

and altogether all-encompassing 
songs are haunting in their raw 
honesty.

In The Altar, Banks is pos-

sessed by the ghost of failed rela-
tionships past, and it comes out in 
the form of sensuous vocals and 
constantly 
stimulating, 
heavy 

beats. It’s the kind of album you 
want to perform a séance to, 
and, more importantly, it’s the 
kind of album that really show-
cases Banks’s growth as an artist. 
Through The Altar, she immerses 
the world in bleak shades of grey 
and gives whoever is listening 
a glimpse into the chaos of her 
own emotions. Beautiful in its 
humanity, The Altar is alive with 
the bittersweet aftertaste of past 
memories. 

The Altar’s incantation com-

mences with “Gemini Feed.” 
Wonderfully 
complex, 
with 

the contrast between vulner-
able vocals dripping in saccha-
rine regret and a dense, steady 
background beat adding interest 
in their dissimilarity, “Gemini 
Feed” is Banks showing the lis-
teners that while she has been 
wounded, she is not meek. This 
song 
(and 
consequently 
this 

entire album) projects iron will-

power in every well crafted note. 
Banks is holding nothing back, 
and this dedication continues 
throughout the rest of the album. 
Like a phoenix rising from the 
ashes of its demise, Banks seems 

to 
take 
strength 

from her own past 
undoing to produce 
songs as impacting 
as “Gemini Feed.” 

Since her debut 

album, 
Goddess, 

Banks’s voice has 
truly 
developed 

and 
matured; 

on The Altar, she explores her 
boundaries to their fullest poten-
tial while still managing to never 
lose sight of her central identity. 
The immensity of dark, formida-
ble songs that had only been hint-
ed at in Goddess is fully explored 
in The Altar. Through pulling 
from discreet R&B rhythms and 
adding unexpected alternative 
twists, Banks has pushed her 
vocals to new heights while still 
managing to hold onto the same 
ominously erotic ambiance that 
she established with iconic favor-
ites such as “Waiting Game” and 
“Begging For Thread.”

On The Altar, songs like “Fuck 

With Myself” and “Poltergeist” 
hold their main attraction in their 
background music. Constantly 
shifting electronic rhythms and 
stimulating, disjointed beats are 
perfectly balanced, with Banks’s 
crooning hovering over the entire 
song like a transparent sheet. 
“Trainwreck” is very similar; it 
is not afraid to be dramatic, to be 
intense, to push the confines. The 
song’s fast-paced, very stream-
of-consciousness lyrics perfectly 
match the swirling vortex of 
anger and passion that this song 
inspires. 

However, The Altar does not 

solely consist of spite-fueled, 
chaotic power anthems. It has 
moments of deep vulnerabil-
ity that Banks does not shy away 
from through muted instru-
mentals and quiet melodies. For 
example, in the song “Lovesick,” 
Banks 
unashamedly 
chants 

“please call me your baby, baby, 
baby / look how long that you 
have kept me waiting” over an 
unobtrusive, decidedly simple 
tune. The songs “Mother Earth” 
and “To The Hilt” are especially 
noteworthy in their use of quiet 
instruments in place of Banks’s 
usual 
brazen, 
alt-pop 
beats. 

“Mother Earth” speaks of pain-
ful yearning over simple guitar 
strums while “To The Hilt” fea-
tures Banks’s lovely voice flow-
ing solo over muted piano chords. 
These two songs allow the album 
to take a break, take a breath and 
gently reflect; they not only pres-
ent Banks’s impressive range but 
also help balance out the album 
as a whole, making it a more 
cohesive piece when looked at 
from start to finish.

Overall, The Altar is well con-

nected, with songs that differ 
enough to be interesting, but 
still mesh well together to make 
the album a collective work of 
art when listened to from begin-
ning to end. To put things sim-
ply, this album is commanding. 
Banks takes control of every one 
of her songs and dictates every 
note, every lyric and every beat 
with purpose and intention. As 
the season begins to change, 
The Altar is not only a perfect 
soundtrack to rainy evenings 
and hideously grinning jack-o’-
lanterns, but it is also a reminder 
that there is always grace in vul-
nerability.

What is “love?” What forms 

can it take? How do you know 
when you feel it? These kinds of 
romance-based, 
open-ended ques-
tions are at the 
center of up-and-
coming 
Chicago 

rapper 
Mick 

Jenkins’s 
debut 

album, The Heal-
ing Component, in 
which he channels 
gospel rap, record-
ed dialogue and 
pensive 
produc-

tion in his search 
for answers.

It can go unsaid that love is a 

tired topic in music. It drives the 
ballads and the radio tracks and 
every third song on every album. 
But as artists do, Jenkins tries to 
put a new spin on an old concept 
in this album.

In some ways he’s successful. 

There’s a remarkable sense of can-
dor here, particularly on the spo-
ken word interludes. The album 
opens on one such interlude, as 
Jenkins and a female friend go 
back and forth over whether she 
truly understands “The Healing 
Component,” the album’s name-
sake. The laughs and pauses feel 
genuine — far less staged than 
the lion’s share of similar album 
antics. Most intriguing of these 
dialogues is “This Type Love?” 
in which Jenkins and presumably 
the same woman discuss whether 
you feel love differently from rela-
tionship to relationship. Jenkins is 
uncomfortable making a conclu-
sive decision, even as the woman 
pushes him to give an answer. 
These are the kinds of talks for the 
quietest hours of the night, after 

the party has finally died down 
and everyone wants to be “real.”

Jenkins has no issue pointing 

that candor at big names in the 
industry, too. He questions Kanye, 

interpolating 
a 

line from Yeezus 
— “When the real 
hold you down, you 
supposed to drown” 
— but turning it 
around: “Wait, wait, 
that 
don’t 
sound 

right.” And he takes 
shots at Drake for 
not giving credit to 
those who helped 
him, 
asking 
“If 

Drake ain’t hold-

ing down Quentin Miller why the 
fuck would I ever give any credit 
to you?” There are a number of 
genuine critiques on this album, 
bemoaning the lack of substance 
in rap today and begging to bring 
the culture back to something 
meaningful.

But it’s that self-righteousness 

that can get Jenkins into trouble 
musically. He has big ideas, and 
there’s an admirable ambition 
here, but there are times when 
that ambition stretches itself thin 
on The Healing Component, like a 
miles-long pool sinking only a few 
inches deep.

Take the album’s title: “The 

Healing Component.” It’s clearly a 
stab at a “concept album” (whatev-
er that means anymore), but that 
huge, overarching thesis meant to 
drive the album seems more like 
a truism than anything else. “The 
Healing Component is love,” Jen-
kins says (it’s also quite obviously 
acronymic for THC, the main 
active drug in marijuana).

While that’s all nice and tidy, 

Jenkins’s “Healing Component” 
never dives deeper than that, and 

no further explanation is attempt-
ed. This kind of cliché preaching 
found throughout his lyricism can 
be frustrating at first, but becomes 
nearly galling when Jenkins sets 
himself up as a better-than-you 
figure in a number of the dialogues 
— “Like she’ll be tryna like ... level 
the playing field all the time. I’m 
just like yo, reality is like, you not 
as stressed as me, you don’t have 
as much shit going on as me …” 

Thus, listening to the album 

front to back can be both tiring 
and unfulfilling — a product of 
occasional redundancy. Still, a 
number of tracks find their foot-
ing to walk the line between ambi-
tion and groundedness. “As Seen 
in Bethsaida” is an immediate 
standout, with Themind’s vocal 
hooks balancing out Jenkins bit-
ing verses. The track name is a 
reference to Jesus, but the actual 
lyrics are far more universal, not 
based in a single religion but on the 
wide-reaching struggle of Black 
Americans, and people in general. 
“Strange Love,” which takes shots 
at Tyler Perry (among others) for 
making the lives of Black Ameri-
cans a minstrel movie, digs deeper 
than the majority of the album can 
manage. And “Daniels Bloom” 
is a brooding, dark track which 
remains potent listen after listen.

Missing, though, are the clear-

headed, uncluttered efforts like 
“Jazz” from The Water[s], or the 
immediately arresting tracks of 
Wave[s], like the standout “Alche-
my.” The result is that The Healing 
Component loses its memorability 
in Jenkins’ discography, a worry-
ing effect for a debut.

Nonetheless, Jenkins shows 

enough promise to remain rel-
evant in 2016. His sophomore 
effort, though, should hit a bit 
harder.

ALBUM REVIEW

FILM REVIEW

The media industry has always 

struggled 
with 
the 
“nobody 

knows” dilemma — the uncertain-
ty of the success of 
a media product 
despite 
whether 

it utilizes known 
talent and formats 
that have been suc-
cessful in the past. 
With regards to 
film, John Krasin-
ski’s (“The Office”) 
directorial effort “The Hollars” 
falls perfectly into this trap as a 
movie with all the right ingredi-
ents that form a bland and tasteless 
stew overall.

Also 
starring 
Krasinski 
— 

American’s button-nose, white 
bread dreamboat — “The Hol-
lars” features a family that comes 
together to provide support for 
Sally Hollar (Margo Martindale, 
“August: Osage County”), the 
matriarch, who is suffering from a 
softball-sized brain tumor. During 
their few days together, each mem-
ber of the family confronts their 
own issues and somehow rectifies 
them by the end of the hour-and-
a-half film.

On the surface, this film seems 

to have potential. It contains all 
the formulaic components of a fun, 
feel-good movie. Its main attrac-
tor is its star-studded cast, which 
includes Krasinski, Martindale, 

Anna Kendrick (“The Last Five 
Years”), Charlie Day (“It’s Always 
Sunny in Philadelphia”) and Rich-
ard Jenkins (“Jack Reacher”) — all 
seasoned actors who have made 
incredible movies and TV shows. 

Even singer/song-
writer/American 
icon Josh Groban 
slides 
his 
way 

onscreen. 
The 

film’s snappy folk 
playlist and simple 
cinematography 
work to create a 
charming 
home-

town aesthetic. It should have been 
easy to produce a simple but enter-
taining family comedic drama, 
something simple but somewhat 
enjoyable.

Instead, “The Hollars” is indis-

putably painful. It tries so hard 
to be a quirky, feel-good comedy 
that it ends up forced and stiff. The 
actors don’t play off each other 
well at all; Krasinski fails to deliver 
his iconic boyish charm, and he 
has absolutely zero chemistry 
with Kendrick, who does her best 
to smooth over his flat jokes. The 
entire family ensemble is uncon-
vincing. The film centers around 
their rocky family dynamics, but 
it is hard to understand where the 
root of their drama is as the film 
provides no context. Their forced 
animosity and angst is matched by 
dialogue with a tone reminiscent 
of the awkward small chat one 
makes with the parents of their 

roommates that they really don’t 
like. The final resolution of the 
family issues seems forced as well, 
with no basis in anything genuine.

The movie is filled with uncom-

fortable and confusing moments. 
John’s (Krasinski) ex-girlfriend 
(Mary-Elizabeth 
Winstead, 

“10 Cloverfield Lane”), also the 
wife of Jason (Day), aggressively 
kisses him in her home, and it’s 
never brought up again. Further, 
John and Rebecca (Kendrick) get 
engaged and deal with planning 
his mother’s funeral, then Rebec-
ca immediately goes into labor at 
the actual funeral. Perhaps most 
disturbing is Martindale’s trau-
matic screams as she begs not to be 
taken into surgery, which transi-
tions sharply to a family serenade 
of “Closer to Fine” by The Indigo 
Girls. Overall there’s a huge pac-
ing issue, as the film is slow until 
the very end, when too much hap-
pens too quickly. The consequence 
of this is a lessening of the actual 
gravity of the high and low points, 
with everything seeming insin-
cere.

The film’s problem is that it tries 

to inject humor into tragedy in 
clever and quirky ways. In actual-
ity, the movie is too lighthearted 
in its actual serious moments. 
Overall, it has a jarring effect that 
leaves the viewer unsatisfied and 
annoyed. The entire film is a relent-
less question of “is this touching, 
or dumb?” — overwhelmingly, the 
answer is the latter.

FILM REVIEW

The myth of JT LeRoy, the liter-

ary avatar of writer Laura Albert, 
is alive and well in Jeff Feuerzeig’s 
(“The Devil and 
Daniel Johnston”) 
documentary 
“Author: The JT 
LeRoy Story.”

JT 
was 
ini-

tially 
a 
persona 

created by Albert 
during phone con-
versations with cri-
sis hotlines. Under 
the recommenda-
tion of her therapist, she started 
to write and publish stories under 
the name “Terminator,” before 
authoring two novels and a short 
story collection under the name 
JT LeRoy. The books were instant 
hits in grungy artist communities, 
and JT quickly became a literary 
“It” boy.

Albert kept up the act by 

employing her sister-in-law Savan-
nah Knoop to play JT. Savannah 
made public appearances, did 
book signings and mingled with 
the artistic elite wearing an awful 
blonde wig and dark sunglasses. 
Albert was Speedie, JT’s British 
friend and confidant. 

“Author” isn’t about unmasking 

JT. The mask comes off within the 

first thirty minutes of the film. It 
seems like it wants to be about why 
JT was created, but doesn’t com-
mit to answering that question 
thoroughly. What “Author” does 
become is a platform for Albert to 

defend and perpet-
uate the myth of JT, 
and for her to prove 
his reality, how-
ever metaphorical it 
might be.

The 
central 

narrative 
of 
the 

formation and evo-
lution of JT is inter-
spersed with home 
movie 
footage 

from Albert’s childhood, and in 
voiceover she chronicles struggles 
with abuse, bullying and low self-
esteem. The information hidden 
here is the key to understanding 
the “why” that is neglected in the 
rest of the film. But it’s too little 
and it comes too late. 

The 
biggest 
problem 
with 

“Author” is that it doesn’t know 
where to spend its time. Too much 
time is spent following JT through 
repetitive red carpet events and 
celebrity phone calls, and most of 
the talking head time is taken up 
by Albert defending the creation 
and reality of JT. The secondary 
characters who were sucked into 
Albert and JT’s orbit aren’t given 
space to tell their stories, stories 

which — at least in the case of 
Savannah — have the potential to 
elevate the film above other docu-
mentary work on the same subject.

“Author” might be worth watch-

ing only for the bizarre recordings 
of celebrity phone conversations. 
The standout is a conversation 
between JT and Courtney Love, in 
which Love pauses the conversa-
tion to do a line of cocaine and the 
subtitles read “snorting sounds.” 
The dream of the ’90s is alive!

The most surprising — and 

potentially the most interesting 
— aspect of the film is how Albert 
and her entourage were able to fool 
so many people for so long. Their 
accents are absurd and Savannah’s 
costume looks just what it is — the 
wig is obvious and the over-sized 
sunglasses are laughable. So many 
people believed something that, at 
least in retrospect, seems so obvi-
ously fake. Maybe that says some-
thing about the willful ignorance 
of the masses or the narcissism of 
celebrity.

The informative content of 

“Author” is fascinating for anyone 
who hasn’t heard the story before, 
but the emotional content falls 
flat. “Author” suffers from a weird 
sort of heartlessness, in which 
emotionally potent content is pre-
sented in a way that warrants little 
to no emotional reaction from its 
audience.

self-examines her public persona

classic 
works 

like 
“Annie 

Hall” and “Man-
hattan” 
dem-

onstrated 
his 

cynical yet allur-
ing 
worldview, 

and it was fur-
ther 
ingrained 

through 
his 

hallmark 
fea-

tures — neurotic 
characters, 
bit-

ing 
dialogue 

and 
thought-

provoking rumi-
nations on existentialism and 
love. But since the early 2000s, 
Allen’s filmography has fluc-
tuated from compelling (“Blue 
Jasmine,” “Match Point” and 
“Midnight in Paris”) to mid-
dling (“Irrational Man,” “Magic 
in the Moonlight” and “To 
Rome with Love”).

Despite 
the 
80-year-old 

writer-director’s tireless work 
ethic, his recent offerings sug-
gest his stories are getting 
tired and formulaic, which is 
particularly evident in Allen’s 
newest light comedy, “Crisis in 
Six Scenes.” The fact that Allen 
regretted making a television 
show in the first place says a lot 
about how poorly “Crisis in Six 
Scenes” is executed.

Some witty lines and warm 

visuals notwithstanding, “Cri-
sis in Six Scenes” is a familiar, 
dull and slow-paced affair in 
Allen’s late-period canon. What 
could have easily been a stage 
play or a decent full-length film 
is instead a show comprised of 
six uninspired episodes filled 
with excessive, dialogue-heavy 
sequences, lackluster camera-
work and grating performances.

Once again playing his trifec-

ta role as writer, director and 
lead actor, Allen plays anxious 
novelist Sidney J. Munsinger, 
another one of his broadly 

stroked protagonists that could 
have been witty in the ’70s, but 
is simply an annoying kvetcher 
now. It’s no surprise that Allen 
hasn’t performed that well on 
the acting side, as the last criti-
cally acclaimed piece he starred 

in was his 1996 
musical 
comedy 

“Everyone Says I 
Love You.” Luckily, 
he gets help from 
his talented co-star 
Elaine May (“Small 
Time 
Crooks”), 

who 
delivers 
a 

standout 
perfor-

mance as his loving 
marriage therapist 
wife Kay. 

The elderly, mid-

dle-class 
couple 

shares a comfort-
able living space 

during the socially turbulent era 
of the 1960s, but suddenly gets 
an unexpected visit from peace-
loving, leftist fugitive Lennie 
Dale (Miley Cyrus, “Hannah 
Montana”). Hijinks ensue, and 
by hijinks, I mean lots and lots 
of senseless rambling from Sid-
ney about how his life has been 
turned upside down because of 
Lennie’s presence.

In a sense, the plot has poten-

tial to work as a microcosm 
reflecting the various societal 
crises and political polariza-
tion of the 1960s and today, but 
it lacks the tenacity and depth 
to explore such topics. Lennie’s 
abrupt arrival sparks a chain of 
events and discussions about 
FBI 
surveillance, 
consumer-

ism and the moral decay of the 
Vietnam War with Sidney and 
among Kay’s all-white female 
book club. However, the results 

are somehow less than stimulat-
ing.

The conversations between 

these 
characters 
may 
seem 

somewhat intriguing on paper, 
but seeing them play out is 
exhausting and dull to watch. 
Cyrus is an especially bad 
choice to play Lennie, deliver-
ing each line with a stilted, awk-
ward cadence. Her acting was 
never really a highlight in the 
first place, and her performance 
comes off as sitcom-y, remi-
niscent of her Disney Channel 
days.

The other cast members do 

their best with what they’re 
given, but it’s easy to tell that 
they’re also struggling under 
the weight of Allen’s script. 
“Orange is the New Black” ’s 
John Magaro certainly brings 
the energy as Alan Brockman, 
the conservative-turned-woke 
son of Sidney’s family friend, 
but 
his 
exaggerated 
recita-

tion of almost every one of his 
lines is cringe-worthy to watch. 
Stand-up comedian Bobby Slay-
ton plays Sidney’s frustrated 
acquaintance, Mel, using the 
best of his brash, intense come-
dic style to fuel a meandering 
sequence between him and 
Sidney in episode three. One 
of the only significantly witty 
scenes involves Lewis Black 
(“Inside Out”) and Becky Ann 
Baker (“Girls”), playing two of 
Kay’s patients who literally hate 
everything about one another, 
but share a distaste for guaca-
mole.

“Crisis in Six Scenes” could 

have served as Allen’s calling 
card from film to television, but 
the series is a creative failure on 
all fronts. The long-held sexual 
abuse allegations against Allen, 
as well as his questionable mar-
riage to his ex-stepdaughter, 
don’t make watching his mate-
rial any easier, either. There’s 
definitely some charm and wit 
left in Allen, but considering 
how the man has become hit-
or-miss in the past few years, 
his days of being one of the most 
acclaimed, notable directors of 
Hollywood seem to be winding 
down.

TV REVIEW

M

y Norton Anthol-
ogy of Theory and 
Criticism gets a lot 

of attention, much more than 
any of my other accessories. If 
you’re look-
ing for people 
to gasp and 
ask what 
you’re doing 
with such an 
obnoxiously 
large book, 
I would rec-
ommend it. 
As usual, the 
five-pound 
anthology 
garnered the friendly concern of 
the person I was talking to — in 
this case, one of my English pro-
fessors. I mentioned that in my 
literary theory class, we were 
starting with New Criticism. I 
rolled my eyes and he responded 
with an audible groan at the 
Formalist movement that domi-
nated 20th-century analysis.

New Criticism is unpopular. 

It’s not as French as deconstruc-
tion, not as relevant as gender 
and queer theory and nowhere 
near as sexy as Marxism. One of 
its key components, close read-
ing, can be an arduous and over-
used pedagogical tool. Because 
the things that we have learned 
from it are so easy to take for 
granted, we often discount it. 
But as I delve further into a 
world in which the insanity of 
the outside bleeds into the text, 
I can understand a case for a 
text as a self-contained object. 
Could the scientific nature of 
New Criticism have a place in 
today’s literary world?

Quite possibly. The trials of 

our current age hold concrete 
parallels to those of the era 
of New Criticism. The move-
ment arose as a dismissal of a 
superficial version of romanti-
cism and subjectivism. In “The 
Intentional Fallacy” and “The 
Affective Fallacy,” William K. 
Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley 
argue that both the author and 

the readers should be excluded 
from the scene. They operate 
on the premise that the creator 
is not in their right mind — that 
they are fundamentally unreli-
able because writing is akin to a 
sort of possession. The theorists 
assert that the author’s “inten-
tion” should not be considered 
and as readers, we shouldn’t 
conflate our emotional respons-
es with the meaning of the text.

I love a good authorial inter-

view, where they reveal some 
hidden meaning in a book and 
entirely enlighten the experi-
ence of reading. But a biography 
can weigh down a text with 
the pressure of expectations. 
When I extensively read Emily 
Dickinson this summer, I 
could vividly picture her — I’d 
been to her house in Amherst 
and listened to a tour describ-
ing her life. I had stood in the 
room where she died, secretly 
touched the chairs in her broth-
er’s house next door. So now it 
feels annoyingly hard to read a 
Dickinson poem and not see the 
homoerotic undertones, not pre-
tentiously nod and say, “Clearly, 
this is about her secret longing 
for her mean-but-hot sister-in-
law, Susan.”

But when I read Louise Gluck 

for the first time this summer, 
it was completely different. At 
the New England Literature 
Program, without the ability to 
stalk her online or learn about 
her life, I could fully immerse 
myself. I dove into lines like 
“We have come too far together 
toward the end now/to fear the 

end. These nights, I am no lon-
ger even certain I know what 
the end means. And you, who’ve 
been with a man— /after the first 
cries /doesn’t joy, like fear, make 
no sound?” Without worrying 
about Gluck herself and who 
she was talking to or thinking 
about, I could actually appreciate 
the melody and meaning of her 
words.

There’s a beautiful argu-

ment in New Criticism against 
gut reactions to a piece of work. 
Emotionality seems to dominate 
the English class discussions of 
today. The words “I think” and “I 
just feel like” are more prevalent 
than references to the actual text. 
I’m not prepared to say that the 
feelings that a piece evokes aren’t 
important, but I disagree with 
the valuation of a reaction over 
analysis. If anyone is looking for 
bold statements, I am prepared to 
say people who overuse the word 
“interesting” in analytical classes 
should be expelled with only a 
copy of the Norton Anthology of 
Theory and Criticism to remind 
them of their time here.

In “The Death of the Author,” 

Barthes states that writing 
becomes a neutral space where 
the subject slips away, meaning 
that no “person” is saying this. 
But to give a text an author is to 
impose a limit on it. There’s so 
much pressure to “have a voice,” 
to be “authentic” in your writ-
ing. New Critics felt that authors 
could have different voices over 
different texts, meaning that 
the volatility of the self could be 
reflected in an author’s work. 
In some ways, the author is cre-
ated by the text instead of the 
other way around. An author 
is not consistent across texts 
and should not be expected to 
be. If we give it a chance, a text 
can speak for itself without any 
author pushing their own neuro-
ses between the lines.

Lerner is secretly longing for her 

mean-but-hot sister-in-law. If this 

is you, email rebler@umich.edu.

once again

There are some risks that 

Wilton Speight needs to avoid. 
Others, the redshirt sophomore 
quarterback 
explains, 
aren’t 

really risks at all.

The Michigan football team’s 

first-year starter has thrown 
10 touchdowns and just two 
interceptions this season, with 
one of the picks coming in a 
crucial game against then-No. 8 
Wisconsin on Saturday.

Speight’s mistake came on the 

Wolverines’ first series of the 
third quarter, when he threw 
into coverage for an interception 
that the Badgers’ Derrick Tindal 
returned 46 yards into Michigan 
territory. That’s the kind of 
gamble Speight has to resist.

“If I had just changed the 

channel, I would have seen an 
open receiver to his left,” he said 
Monday. “But when there’s a guy 
here, and a guy there, and a guy 
behind (senior tight end Jake 
Butt), that’s the fine line I need 
to walk.”

But in the fourth quarter, 

Speight lined up in a similar 
formation, 
with 
fifth-year 

senior wide receivers Amara 
Darboh and Jehu Chesson split 
to either side, Butt on the line of 
scrimmage and redshirt junior 
Ty Isaac the lone setback.

Speight faked the handoff 

to Isaac and again looked over 
the middle for his first option, 
Butt, who was swarmed by 
linebackers and safeties. That 
time, Speight shifted his eyes to 
the left to find Darboh in one-
on-one coverage with Tindal on 
the outside.

Many 
consider 
the 
deep 

pass to be a risky play, but in 
cases like that, Speight doesn’t. 

He dropped back and lofted 
a perfect throw where only 
Darboh could get it — a longer 
attempt, but a far safer one 
nonetheless.

“When there’s a one-on-one 

deep shot, I’ve got two of the 
best receivers in the country, 
so that’s not really a fine line,” 
Speight said. “That’s give them 
a chance, give them the best ball 
I can and they’ll make me look 
good.”

Speight 
said 
he’s 
getting 

better at walking that line 
between taking shots and giving 
his team a chance to achieve 
the best outcome on every play. 
A completion downfield is the 
ideal option. If it’s an incomplete 
pass, that’s OK, too. But Speight 
knows he has to avoid turnovers 
like the one Saturday.

To do so, he has been good at 

scanning the field to search for 
the receiver in the best position. 
He had success Saturday by 
shifting from Butt to Darboh, 
and the week before against 
Penn State, he threw a 3-yard 
touchdown pass to freshman 
tight end Devin Asiasi on a play 
designed for Chesson.

“You 
rarely 
have 
plays 

throughout the game that always 
go to your first read, your main 
read,” Speight said. “You gotta 
just have it be second nature. 
You say, ‘OK, he’s not there, 
now where do my eyes go? Now 
where do my eyes go?’ Coach 
(Jim) Harbaugh always says you 
gotta change the channel as fast 
as possible, and if you don’t see 
your main read open, you’ve got 
to find number two, three and 
sometimes four.”

Harbaugh is pleased with 

that tendency, complimenting 
Speight’s decision-making even 
on a day when the quarterback 

threw his second interception.

“It’s 
beyond 
his 
years,” 

Harbaugh said Monday. “It’s 
been a real positive. Talked about 
it the other day, his decision 
making and going through the 
film. He’s making good decisions 
— the right decisions.”

Speight also sees points for 

improvement from Saturday’s 
game, ones that may not be 
apparent on first glance. He ended 
up with only one interception 
but nearly threw more, once 
throwing into coverage when he 
could have thrown shorter to an 
open receiver.

And even if there is no 

check-down, if the running 

back is engaged in blocking, 
Speight always has the option of 
throwing the ball away.

“There’s one I just chucked 

deep as basically an incomplete,” 
Speight said. “I saw Darboh 
was double-covered, Jake was 
covered like a glove, but I didn’t 
have any check-downs. So there’s 
no point in running around and 
possibly taking a sack when I can 
just airmail it and just move onto 
the next play.”

All of those in-play decisions 

have come easier to Speight 
as he has worked more with 
Harbaugh, 
passing 
game 

coordinator Jedd Fisch and 
their offense, and perhaps that’s 

part of the reason Michigan’s 
passing game is further along 
statistically than it was a year 
ago. Much of that improvement 
has come from developing the 
relationship between Speight 
and his coaches.

On Sunday mornings, Speight 

comes into the team’s facility to 
look at the tape and the notes 
Fisch left him from the night 
before. By Monday, he’s already 
focused on the next game, which 
comes 
against 
Rutgers 
this 

week. After that one, he’ll once 
again look at the throws he made 
to the right receiver, and the 
ones he didn’t, and he’ll start the 
process over again.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight threw a 46-yard touchdown pass Saturday to beat Wisconsin, 14-7.

Harbaugh says quarterback’s decision-making abilities are ‘beyond his years,’ ‘a real positive’ 

Dominant D-Line proves self against Badgers

Saturday, 
the 
Michigan 

football team’s defensive line 
could 
tell 
that 
Wisconsin’s 

quarterback Alex Hornibrook 
was struggling after getting 
hit a few times. The redshirt 
freshman was suffering from a 
case of “happy feet.”

“Oh yeah, we actually talked 

about that on the field,” fifth-
year senior defensive tackle 
Matt Godin said Monday. “We 
were like, ‘Oh, he’s starting to 
flinch a little bit.’ Obviously 
with 
(defensive 
coordinator 

Don) Brown and all the blitzes 
we throw at them and all of 
the great pass rushers we have 
on the edge, especially with 
(defensive ends Chris Wormley 
and Taco Charlton). But yeah, 
we could definitely feel that he 
was starting to get happy feet.”

So 
far 
this 
season, 
the 

Wolverines’ defense has tallied 
20 sacks, two of them coming 
Saturday in a 14-7 victory over 
the 
eighth-ranked 
Badgers. 

Hornibrook also completed just 
nine of 25 passes while the sacks 
dropped his rushing total to 
negative-16 yards. 

The Wolverines also held 

Wisconsin to just eight first 
downs and 71 net yards rushing. 
It’s hard to attribute this type of 
domination to anything other 
than a stout defensive line. 

Now, after playing most of the 

first month without Charlton 
and 
defensive 
tackle 
Bryan 

Mone, an already successful unit 
will get even better as the pair 
is able to contribute more and 
more.

“(The defensive line) has been 

outstanding,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh. “It’s been 
a stalwart part of our football 
team since I’ve been here and 
before that as well. If a guy 
goes in and comes back into 

the lineup — I’m thinking of 
Mo Hurst, Chris Wormley, Ryan 
Glasgow, Taco Charlton — right 
down the list, they play extremely 
well. One guy’s out and another 
steps up; it’s impressive. I think 
(defensive line 
coach) 
Greg 

Mattison does 
an 
incredible 

job. Credit to 
the youngsters, 
the 
players 

themselves, for 
their effort and 
their talent.”

When 
the 

offense starts to struggle, as it 
did on Saturday, it’s essential to 
look to the defense to make plays, 
and so far, it hasn’t cracked. The 
Wolverines rank fifth nationally 

in tackles for loss and fourth 
nationally in sacks (first in the 
Big Ten in both). Because of this, 
Michigan has been able to hold 
each of its first two conference 
opponents to fewer than 200 

yards. 

Despite 

going 
up 

against 
a 

powerful 
Wisconsin 
offensive line 
that 
boasted 

some 
big 

players, 
the 

Wolverines 

were still able to stay composed. 

“Yeah, 
there 
were 
some 

big boys up front,” said senior 
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
Saturday. “I think they were 

averaging like 6-foot-6, 320 or 
315 (pounds). We’re not quite 
as big up front, but it all comes 
down to technique and effort on 
the D-line, and I think we played 
hard, I think we played fast, and 
I think we played with great 
technique. All that credit goes to 
Coach Mattison. 

“When I looked to my left and 

look to my right, I’d see guys 
who’re in the program four or five 
years and who really wanted this 
game up front, so we accepted 
the challenge and I think we did 
a good job.”

Mone rejoined the defensive 

line over the weekend, and 
though he only played a few 
snaps, his presence was felt. 
Monday, Godin spoke of the 
energy Mone brings to the unit. 

Though Mone is just a redshirt 
sophomore and sat out all last 
season due to a broken ankle, he’s 
a well-respected member of the 
defensive line. 

“There’s a lot of leaders on this 

defense and a lot of playmakers,” 
Glasgow said. “I think that’s the 
biggest thing they bring. Taco 
is an elite pass rusher. Bryan’s 
one of the strongest kids I’ve 
ever seen play a double team, do 
anything on the football field.”

Now that the Wolverines have 

the option of rotating players in 
and out of the line with no more 
injury troubles to fear, they will 
be better prepared for their first 
road game of the season. 

“We have everyone back now, 

healthy and ready to go, so it’s 
great,” Godin said.

Donlon brings intensity on ‘D’

Meet Billy Donlon, Michigan’s 

new defensive coordinator.

And before you start to fret, 

don’t worry, Don Brown still has 
his job. Instead, Donlon is one 
of the latest additions to John 
Beilein’s staff — filling the void 
left by LaVall Jordan and Bacari 
Alexander’s departure last April.

Donlon comes to the Michigan 

carrying 
ample 
coaching 

experience, most recently as the 
head coach at Wright State.

At the Wolverines’ team media 

day Monday, Beilein put trust in 
that experience, explaining that 
his new assistant will essentially 
be taking the reigns on the 
defensive end of the floor. 

“I’m giving him a lot of 

responsibility for the defense,” 
Beilein said. “He’s got my eye and 
the detail we do in offense, I think 
he’s got a similar eye for defense. … 
I’ve tried to really sit back. When 
(you allow teams to) score 47 
percent like we did last year, we 
had to have a different mindset in 
practice and our players needed to 
have a different mindset.”

Donlon’s path to Michigan 

started 
long 
before 
April, 

and perhaps long before he 
considered the possibility. In 
fact, it started 20 years ago as a 
point guard at North Carolina-
Wilmington, where he competed 
“mostly unsuccessfully” against 
Richmond when Beilein was a 
coach there.

Beilein recalled how difficult 

it was to score against the 
Seahawks, 
and 
his 
respect 

for Donlon’s coaching ability 
stemmed from the way Donlon 
was 
coached 
himself. 
They 

stayed in touch ever since UNC-
Wilmington faced the Spiders 
in the 1998 Colonial Athletic 
Conference 
Tournament 

championship game.

Fast-forward to last March, 

and Donlon had been fired by 
Wright State despite leading 

his team to the Horizon League 
championship game for the third 
time in four years. And then he 
got a phone call from Beilein.

There 
weren’t 
any 
job 

opportunities at Crisler Center 
yet. Beilein called as a friend, 
but when Jordan and Alexander 
accepted 
coaching 
offers 

at 
Milwaukee 
and 
Detroit, 

respectively, the stars aligned. 

“To be honest with you, it just 

shows you the kind of person 
Coach (Beilein) is because I didn’t 
play for Coach,” Donlon said. 
“At that time he didn’t have any 
openings yet. …I called him when 
an opening happened and we just 
started talking.

“All those phone conversations 

from there were very little about 
the job. His passion for the game 
is off the charts. You can be on the 
phone with him for a great amount 
of time just talking basketball. 
That’s really what we did.”

Now 
coaching 
alongside 

the man he played against, 
Donlon’s respect for Beilein is 
evident. He was quick to say 
being the Wolverines’ defensive 
coordinator is an overstatement 
— and that Beilein is still calling 
the shots for this team, which 
he undoubtedly is. But Donlon’s 
comments may have had a bit too 
much humility.

Beilein estimated that Wright 

State was ranked around 100th 
nationally in transition defense, 
while Michigan was roughly 
100 spots lower. And last season, 
Donlon’s Raiders were ranked 
37th nationally in team defense, 
allowing 65.8 points per game. 
The Wolverines didn’t crack the 
top 50 in the same category.

Without a doubt, there is 

a discrepancy in the level of 
competition between the two 
programs. It didn’t help that the 
Wolverines were without one of 
their best perimeter defenders 
in Caris LeVert, either. But that 
doesn’t mean Donlon’s approach 
can’t be effective in Ann Arbor.

While the Wolverines won’t 

be going through a complete 
overhaul, Donlon’s experience 
running the “pack line” variation 
of 
the 
man-to-man 
scheme 

at Wright State will certainly 
add a new wrinkle to Beilein’s 
defensive playbook.

“We’re a gap team, and the gap 

really is very similar to the pack 
line,” Donlon said. “The pack line 
is a little lower. In the gap, you’re 
a little closer, in terms of you’re 
up the line a little bit more. So 
you’re one step off the line of the 
ball and your man versus maybe 
two steps in the pack line.

“…The great thing about both 

of those, you can easily go from 
the gap to the pack line and then 
back because they’re so similar. ”

The emphasis is on more than 

just defensive sets, though. Beilein 
hopes he and Donlon can find a 
middle ground when it comes to 
fouling on defense. Last season, 
Michigan averaged 15.6 fouls 
while Wright State averaged 22.1.

It’s not every day you hear a 

coach say he wants to foul more, 
but for a team that has been 
occasionally dubbed as soft, a touch 
of physicality in the right situations 
could go a long way. If the coaching 
duo can strike that balance, the 
Wolverines could change that 
reputation, and quickly.

Though 
Donlon 
has 
been 

tasked 
with 
recalibrating 

Michigan’s defense, he will also 
serve as a coach for the Wolverine 
backcourt. With senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. leading the 
charge, freshman Xavier Simpson 
and 
junior 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman, 
he 
certainly 

has plenty of ammunition to work 
with.

But 
more 
than 
anything, 

Donlon is caught in a game of 
catch up, trying to bring the 
Wolverines’ defense up to par 
with 
its 
perennially 
potent 

offense. It’s no easy task.

But if someone is going to 

achieve it, it seems the guy who 
shut down John Beilein’s team in 
1998 is the man for the job.

‘M’ needs Kile more than ever

W

hen Alex Kile came to 
Michigan, he wasn’t 
expected to be a leader. 

He entered 
his freshman 
year side by 
side with JT 
Compher and 
Tyler Motte, 
two forwards who donned ‘C’ and 
‘A’ patches on their jerseys in their 
tenures and now find themselves 
in NHL training camps.

His sophomore year, all of 

the buzz surrounded Dylan 
Larkin, a player who is now an 
All-Star forward for the Detroit 
Red Wings. And as a junior, his 
fellow recruiting class members 
— Compher and Motte — were 
joined by Kyle Connor to form 
the most lethal offensive line in 
the country. Connor won the Big 
Ten Player of the Year award, 
and, you guessed it, has now 
moved on to the NHL.

After Sunday’s exhibition win 

against Windsor, the Wolverines 
announced that they will be 
without even more talent from 
last season. Sophomore forward 
Cooper Marody, the team’s 
second leading returning scorer, 
has been deemed ineligible for 
the first semester of the season.

But Kile remains. And on a 

team that is laden with freshmen 
and questions of where production 
will come from, he has been 
thrust into the spotlight — named 
co-captain along with senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong. Now 
is his time to take center stage.

Kile has taken on the role with 

grace. The senior is clearly aware 
that he is being watched more 
closely now — and not just by 
outsiders waiting to see what the 
Wolverines can do this year, but 
also by his own teammates.

“The biggest thing for me is 

just leading by example on the 
ice and off the ice,” Kile said last 
Thursday. “I feel like these guys 
all look up to me, and they look 
up to all of the seniors. So you 
just have to bring it every single 
day — work hard in the weight 

room and work hard on the ice.”

And it’s not as if the senior isn’t 

physically equipped to take over 
his heightened role. Last season 
was the best of Kile’s career at 
Michigan. He appeared in 38 
games for the Wolverines and 
notched 34 points in total, good 
enough for fifth-best on the team.

But Kile certainly has a 

different cast around him now. 
The senior is flanked on the first 
line by freshmen Will Lockwood 
and Jake Slaker, a line that head 
coach Red Berenson knows is 
vital to the success of the team. 

“I think it’s really important 

who he plays with because he 
has to be a factor in this year’s 
team — a big factor.” Berenson 
said after the team’s exhibition 
win against Windsor Sunday. 
“And we thought the best fit right 
now was for him to play with 
these two freshmen: Slaker and 
Lockwood. They’re coming in 
with a lot of momentum, a lot 
of confidence, and they seem to 
have fit with Alex Kile.”

Even if Lockwood and Slaker 

are able to surpass expectations 
and make strong contributions, 
they will surely need some 
time to adjust to the speed of 
college hockey. And Kile will be 
expected to aid in their transition 
and anchor the first line while 
the freshmen get comfortable. 

The line had a fairly good debut 

against the Lancers. Though they 
weren’t involved in either of the 
team’s goals, Kile, Lockwood 
and Slaker combined for 12 of 
Michigan’s 36 shots on goal.

But that performance won’t 

be enough to quell the concerns 
of where the Wolverines will 
replace last season’s production. 
For without former classmates 
Compher and Motte, without 
former leading scorers Larkin 
and Connor, and now without 
Marody, Alex Kile is the face of 
the program.

And if he is unable to fill 

those shoes, the Wolverines 
will be once again searching 
for somebody else to produce — 
something the team likely can’t 
afford to do.

Michigan assistant coach Billy Donlon will be tasked with revitalizing the Michigan basketball team’s defense.
New season beckons for ‘M’

Back in March, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team’s season 
ended with a crushing loss in 
the first round 
of the NCAA 
Tournament.

Seven months after that 

70-63 loss to Notre Dame, 
things are drastically different 
around the program.

Gone from the team is Caris 

LeVert (who ended up with the 
Brooklyn Nets after being taken 
20th overall in the NBA Draft), 
a trio of then-sophomores in 
Aubrey Dawkins, Ricky Doyle 
and Kam Chatman (all of whom 
transferred to other schools), 
and Spike Albrecht, who left 
the program to join Big Ten 
rival Purdue for his final year 
of NCAA eligibility.

Also 
gone 
are 
assistant 

coaches Bacari Alexander and 
LaVall Jordan. In their places 
are Billy Donlon, a former 
head coach at Wright State, 
and 
Saddi 
Washington, 
a 

former associate head coach at 
Oakland.

But Michigan coach John 

Beilein has stayed put, and he’s 
ready to lead the Wolverines 

in their quest to return to the 
NCAA Tournament.

COMPETITION 
DOWN 

LOW: Going into the new 
season, one of the biggest 
questions is who will play 
down 
low 
for 
Michigan. 

While freshman center Jon 
Teske and freshman forward 
Austin Davis could eventually 
get minutes down low, the 
competition for the starting 
spot at the ‘5’ will be between 
senior forward Mark Donnal 
and 
sophomore 
forward 

Moritz Wagner.

While the duo combined for 

just over 10 points per game 
last season, they will be relied 
on heavily to contribute on 
both ends of the court.

Additionally, 
sophomore 

forward 
D.J. 
Wilson 
and 

redshirt junior guard Duncan 
Robinson will duke it out for 
the starting role at the ‘4.’

And while one player will 

pull ahead and take the starting 
slot, there is no question that 
the depth behind them will 
be experienced — something 
that cannot be said at guard, 
where freshmen Ibi Watson 
and Xavier Simpson will be 
relied on.

“We have experienced depth 

with the bigger guys,” Beilein 
said. “That’s really good to 
have veteran depth, guys who 
have played for a year, at least.”

LEADERSHIP 
SHIFT: 

Four years ago, senior guards 
Derrick Walton Jr. and Zak 
Irvin came to Michigan as 
heralded recruits. Both played 
instantly and made a sizable 
impact 
even 
as 
freshmen. 

Now, in their last season at 
the University, their role has 
changed quite a bit.

Irvin and Walton have taken 

a larger leadership role, not 
only as players who lead by 
example, but also in their vocal 
presence in the locker room.

And it hasn’t gone unnoticed.
“Ever since this summer, 

I’ve seen tremendous growth 
in (Zak and Derrick) in being 
able to lead and speak and 
push and encourage with the 
younger guys,” Beilein said.

Added Robinson: “They both 

kinda realize that it’s their last 
year here. There’s more of a 
sense of urgency, and they 
understand that we have the 
capabilities to accomplish a 
lot of great things. As seniors, 
they’re trying to put us in 
the best position to make it 
happen.”
