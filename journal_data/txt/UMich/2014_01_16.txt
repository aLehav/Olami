Researchers create
MARLO to develop
understanding of
leg locomotion
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Mythical creatures have a
tendency to sparkle in sunlight,
but a walking robot that exists
on the University's campus was
working on something far more

impressive when it ventured out
into the open air.
MARLO, a bipedal robot, is
helping researchers develop the
science of leg locomotion for
machines. Essentially, the goal of
working with MARLO is to get
robots to walk just as well as, if
not better than, humans.
MARLO was designed and
built by Jonathan Hurst, assis-
tant engineering professor at
Oregon State University, using
funding provided by the Defense
Advanced Research Project
Agency, a program funded bythe

Department of Defense. MARLO
is one of three robots created
using Hurst's ATRIAS principle,
or "assume the robot is a sphere."
The other two robots are housed
at Oregon State University and
Carnegie Melon University.
For the past two years, Engi-
neering Prof. Jessy Grizzle has
led a team of University scientists
on a quest to program MARLO
in the best, most stable way pos-
sible. He said in the future, these
robots could be used to assist in
situations that might threaten
human life.

Grizzle said robots like
MARLO could play a critical
role in recovering from natural
disasters like the tsunami that
hit Japan in 2011. The tsunami
struck the Fukushima nuclear
power plant and caused enor-
mous damage and subsequent
radiation leaks that proved too
dangerous for humans to try to
fix.
"We want machines to go into
situations that are too dangerous
for humans, or more dangerous

Diversity, healthcare
and fundraising
on the agenda for
unofficial meetings

Jay Z must have gotten it right.
In place of their monthly pub-
lic meeting, the University's
Board of Regents will spend Jan.
16 and 17 in New York City glean-
ing some Empire State inspira-
tion from a handful of the East
Coast's most prominent higher
education leaders. Between
meetings, the regents will also
court the region's vast network of
alumni and donors at two events
planned by the University's Office
of Development.
Following their Jan. 2013 trip
to California, the University's
delegation plans to confront an
array of issues, including digital

education, diversity on campus
and college affordability.
Like Los Angeles, New York
City has one of the largest popu-
lations of University alumni and
around 2,000 Universitystudents
call the state home.
In an e-mail, Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R), chair of the
Board of Regents, said although a
similar fact-finding trip had not
occurred for more than a decade,
the regents found that last year's
trip included "the best sessions
ever in their many years of ser-
vice on the board."
Newman said the trip is
intended to provide the regents
and the University's top officers
with an opportunity to discuss
pressing issues in higher educa-
tion and chart the instiution's
course into the future.
"Taking time to do a little blue-
sky thinking and asking ourselves
'what if' questions is really impor-
tant and very valuable," Newman
wrote. "It is especially pertinent
this year as we search for the next
president of the University."

HOSPITAL
Local counties
report multiple
deaths by flu

SPOTLIGHT

Dozens in intensive
care at UMHS as
HiNi influenza
outbreak spreads
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
Daily Staff Reporter
Forty patients are currently
being treated at the University
Hospital for influenza, and over
a dozen of those are in intensive
care.
In Washtenaw County, two
adult patients - one of whom was
treated at University Hospital -
have died from the flu. Oakland
County has suffered three patient
deaths, all of whom were in their
20s, The Detroit News reported
Tuesday.
Statewide, six adult deaths and
one pediatric death have been
reported.
While the state only official-
ly tracks pediatric flu-related
deaths, counties may choose to
report adult deaths at their own
discretion.

In response to the uptick in
influenza cases, the University
of Michigan Health System has
put a visitor restriction policy in
place. This measure means any-
body coming to visit a patient in
the hospital is asked to stayhome
if they have flu symptoms, and
children under the age of 12 may
not visit any patient who is hospi-
talized with the flu.
Most of UMHS influenza
patients have contracted H1N1,
though UMHS spokeswoman
Kara Gavin said the hospital has
only tested for specific strains in
certain cases.
The H1N1 strain of influenza is
most commonly associated with
the 2009 pandemic. At that time,
there was no vaccine and the dis-
ease killed over 470 individuals in
the U.S. alone. However, research
since the outbreak lead to the
creation of the vaccine currently
being offered.
Eden Wells, a clinical associate
professor at the School of Public
Health, said it's hard to predict
how this flu season will continue,
but that the public health com-

Spokesman says
weather response
plans worked well
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
After nearly a week of tem-
peratures hovering around
zero degrees, the city of Ann
Arbor is recovering.
However, the city is more

equipped to handle the frigid
temperatures and above aver-
age snowfalls than it might
have seemed during the wintry
trip back to Ann Arbor after
break.
Robert Kellar, the city's
communications specialist for
public services, said that the
damages done to the roads and
property were minor, and the
extended below-freezing tem-
peratures were not that out of
the ordinary for this time of

year.
"This is not totally unusu-
al for this area," Kellar said.
"There is the normal wear and
tear onthe roads because plow-
ing is not a frictionless process,
and you have the occasional
mailbox that is a victim."
Keller added that the
extreme weather may cause
a few more water line breaks
than usual.

Alumni Profile: Drew Philp

Drew Philp grew up in Adri-
an, Mich. and graduated from
the University in 2008. He then
moved to Detroit, where he
bought an abandoned house on
the city's east side for $500 and
completely renovated it.
He is a freelance journalist,
and his experience in Detroit
was recounted in a BuzzFeed
story, Why I Bought A House In
Detroit For $500, published Jan.
9 and garnered over 1.3 million
views.
What were some of your
favorite college memories?
Certainly, The Michigan
Daily. Working at the Daily was
the start of my writing career.

I also liked living in the Luther
Co-op. I participated in the
Prison Creative Arts project as
well.
Why did you decide to move
to Detroit after graduation?
How did this differ fromwhat
most of your friends did?
At the time it seemed like
everyone was moving out of the
state, but we are the leaders and
the best and I wanted to help
the state I came from. I wanted
to use my education in the best
way possible.
Detroit is really the heartbeat
of Michigan and arguably the
Midwest.

How has your education at
the University affected your
experience in Detroit?
Mostly what Michigan gave
me is a way to think about
things in terms of being respect-
ful in terms of race, class, etc.
The people of Detroit are some
of the best, most kind people
I've ever met.
I think they've taught me a
lot more than I have been able to
teach anyone and I think it will
continue to be that way. I have
learned kindness and practical
skills about the world I want to
live in.

State fiscal leaders estimate
uptick in revenue by $971M

Senate panel deems attack
in Benghazi preventable

Michigan gov. plans
to use funds for
neglected areas
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
Potential tax breaks and addi-
tional funding for needed ser-
vices may be in the future for
Michigan in the upcoming fiscal
year, as lawmakers project a $971
million surplus in state revenue.
Fiscal leaders fromthe Senate,
House and executive branch, as
well as economists from across
the state, met at the January Rev-
enue Estimating Conference on
Friday to predict the amount of
available revenue for the next fis-
cal year.
Of the projected figure, $325
million will be put toward the
long-term budget and $646 mil-
lion will be used for one-time
appropriations, the Detroit Free

Press reported.
Daniil Manaenkov an
Fulton, both professor,

However, critics of his policies,
id George most notably State Senate Minor-

the hous- putting the tax burden on the
causes of working class, the elderly and

purchas- fire for his decision to slash fund-

aificantly. Roger Kahn said, in a press
release despite the surplus, the
budget should still be approached
responsibly.
State House Republicans are
pressing for tax reliefs for the
citizens who made the surplus
possible in the first place. John
Nixon, Director of the Depart-
ment of Technology, Manage-
ment and Budget, has argued that
offering taxpayers a rebate makes
the most sense when discussing
how to allocate funds.
Anna Heaton, spokeswoman
for House Appropriations Com-
mittee Chair Joe Haveman, said
the House feels equally as cau-
tious as the Senate when acting

man believes that the allocation
process is still in its early stages
and lawmakers are still deciding
their next steps.
"Once there is a surplus,
everyone starts saying we should

said. "He is just saying, 'Yes we

think about this and think about
where we can invest it and will

Report implicates
ambassador and
poor communication
with security forces
WASHINGTON (AP) --Both
highly critical and bipatosan, a
Senate report declared Wednes
day that the deadly assault on the
American diplomatic compound
in Benghazi, Libya, could have
been prevented. The account
spreads blame among the State
Department, the military and
U.S. intelligence for missing what
now seem like obvious warning
signs.
For the first time in the much-
politicized aftermath, the report
also points at Ambassador Chris
Stevens, who was killed in the
attack. It says that the State
Department ended a deal with
the military to have a special
operations team provide extra
security in Libya, and that Ste-
vens twice refused an offer to
reinstate the team in the weeks
before the Sept. 11, 2012, attack.
The military also takes criti-
cism in the report for failing to
respond more quickly on the
night of the assault.
On the 11th anniversary of the
9/11 terror attacks in the U.S.,
armed militants stormed the dip-
lomatic outpost in Benghazi, set-
ting the building on fire. Stevens,
information technology special-
ist Sean Smith, and CIA security
contractors Tyrone Woods and
Glen Doherty, both former Navy
SEALs, were killed over the
course of two battles that night.
Stevens died of smoke inha-
lation after he was taken to a
"safe room" in the besieged com-
pound. The Obama administra-
tion, reluctant to deal publicly
with a terror attack weeks before
the presidential election, first
described the assault as a spon-
taneous mob protest of an anti-
Islamic, American-made video.
Such a protest did occur at the
U.S Embassy in Caire arlicr
that day.

Officials corrected their
description days after the attack,
but by then it had become a hot
political issue that has continued
to dog the administration.
On that issue, the report dives
into the contentious initial talk-
ing points issued by the intelli-
gence community, which helped
fuel Republican allegations of an
Obama administration cover up
of militant links to the violence.
'Intelligence analysts inac-
curately referred to the presence
of a protest at the U S. mission
facility before the attack based
on open source information and
limited intelligence but without
sufficient intelligence or eyewit-
ness statements to corroborate
that assertion," the report said,
addingthat U.S. intelligence then
took too long to correct the error.
The senators also take the
administration to task for failing
to bring the attackers to justice
more than a year later. They say
the U.S. has identified several
individuals responsible but can't
capture them because of limited
intelligence capabilities in the
region and limited cooperation
by local governments.
Intelligence Committee
Chairman Diasie Feinstein, a
Democrat, said she hoped the
report would put to rest conspir-
acy theories about the attacks.
Republican Vice Chairman
Saxby Chambliss said the report
showed that despite a deteriorat-
ing security situation in Beng-
hazi, the U.S. government did not
do enough to prevent the attacks
or to protect the diplomatic facil-
ity. And Republican committee
member Susan Collins of Maine
called on the administration to
punish those responsible.
"A broken system overseen by
senior leadership contributed to
the vulnerability of U.S. diplo-
mats ... in one of the most danger-
ous cities in the world," she said
in the report. "And yet the secre-
tary of state has not held anyone
responsible for the system's fail-
ings."
U.S. intelligence ultimately
blamed the violence on militants

who overran the temporary U.S.
mission and, hours later, fired
mortars at the nearby CIA annex
where the Americans had taken
shelter.
The report says the subse-
quent investigation showed
individuals from many militant
groups took part in the "oppor
tunistic" attacks, including al
Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb
the Libyan militia group Ansar
al-Sharia, and members of the
Yemeni-based al-Qaida in the
Arabian Peninsula.
The report does rsot name
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
was secretary of state at the time
and now is a potential 2016 presi-
dential candidate.
The State Department said
the report largely reaffirms the
findings reached a year ago by
the Benghazi Accountability
Review Board, headed by a for-
mer ambassador and former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. Deputy spokeswoman
Marie Harf noted that the Senate
report recommended improve-
ments to security that the State
Department has already taken,
including upgrading security
cameras improving fire equip
amesot and increasing the pre.
ence of Nlarine security guards.
The Senate report notes that
the State Department has also
created a new assistant secretary
position for high-threat posts,
but it says the department still
needs institutional change to help
it react more quickly to security
threats. It says State should not
rely on local security alone in
countries where the host govern-
ment cannot provide adequate
protection and should avoid using
diplomatic facilities it knows are
inadequately protected.
The report says that the
department in 2012 had ignored
its own "tripwires" set to deter-
mine when it had become too
dangerous to operate in Beng-
hazi, and continued to operate
the facility there despite a grow-
ing number of U.S. intelligence
reports showing the danger was
rising.

REGENTS
From Page 1A
University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Provost Martha
Pollack, Tim Slottow, executive
vice president and chief finan-
cial officer, and Sally Churchill,
vice president and secretary, will
accompany the eight regents.
Ora Pescovitz, University
Health System chief executive
officer, Jerry May, vice president
for development and E. Royster
Harper, vice president for student
life will also participate in some
of the sessions.
Sessions to cover affordability,
healthcare and digital education
During the trip, the group will
hold a series of meetings designed
to provide insights into a set of
challenges facing higher educa-
tion institutions across the coun-
try.
Similar to the California trip
schedule, which tapped leaders
from University of California-
Berkeley, Stanford University and
Google, the regentswill hear from
the East Coast's top university
administrators during two days of
sessions.
Though a portion of the discus-
sion in California included the
ongoing budget difficulties faced
by the University of California
system, the New York trip sched-
ule is weighted more towards
sessions with leaders or former
leaders of private institutions.
The regents plan to meet with
Bill Bowen, president emeritus
of Princeton University, Peter
Salovey, president of Yale Univer-
sity, Mike John, retired executive
vice president for medical affairs
at Emory University and Edward
Miller, retired executive vice
president for medical affairs at
John Hopkins University.
However, in an interview with
The Michigan Daily, Coleman
said New York is a place where a

lot of people are broadly thinking
about higher education's greatest
challenges. She emphasized New
York's central location as a key
factor in facilitating the schedul-
ing of sessions with leaders from
up and down the East Coast.
"I think that a lot of the ideas
they have and the lessons they've
learned over time will be appli-
cable for us," Coleman said.
Bowen, who is the current
president of the Mellon Founda-
tion, will lead the regents in a
discussion about how best to fos-
ter an evolution in undergraduate
education while maintain quality
instruction.
Bowen secured funding for
the studies testing the efficacy
of online learning at the Mellon
Foundation.
"He is one of the most knowl-
edgeable people in the world
because he has been at it for so
long and he has funded work and
really looked at the evidence and
the data," Coleman said.
Similar conversations about
the role of online education have
been ongoing at the University. In
the fall, Pollack launched a series
of town hall forums on digital
education.
Salovey, the president of Yale
University, will also lead a dia-
logue covering the University's
most prominent issues, includ-
ing diversity, affordability and
engaged learning.
Though the regents discussed
affordability and digital educa-
tion during last year's trip to Cali-
fornia, healthcare will also be at
the forefront of the regents' agen-
da in New York.
Coleman said the new empha-
sis on this particular discussion
emerged from the recent imple-
mentation of the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act, one
of the biggest factors changing
the evolution of university health
systems.
In the fall, multiple speakers

at the public presidential search
forums said experience managing
a large health system is a critical
trait need in the next University
president.
John, the former executive
vice president for medical affairs
at Emory University and Miller,
retired executive vice president
for medical affairs at John Hop-
kins University, are scheduled to
lead a dialogue on the future of
healthcare reform and academic
medical centers.
Coleman said all of the meet-
ings are designed to foster open
dialogue, rather than structured,
less engaging PowerPoint presen-
tations.
"(The trip) gives an opportuni-
ty to sort of break out of the mold,
and not have the structured meet-
ings and the committee meetings
thatwe would normallyhave with
the regents meeting," Coleman
said. "It gives an opportunity for
people to have a wider ranger dis-
cussion, think in different ways."
Regents to engage donor, alum-
ni network
Coinciding with the Regents'
meeting will be two events host-
ed by the University's Office of
Development to work the New
York donor base. There are cur-
rently 38,000 alumni living with-
in 50 miles of New York City.
The events will take place less
than three months after the Uni-
versity kicked off the Victors for
Michigan campaign, which aims
to raise $4 billion over the next
few years. Though the Univer-
sity will not actually raise money
during the two New York events,
development officials hope engag-
ing donors will translate into gifts
down the road.
May, the University's vice
president for development, is
spearheading this week's event,
along with the University's two
development officers based in
New York and a third officer from
Boston.

In light of the $525 million the
University raised in New York
during its last fundraising cam-
paign, The Michigan Difference,
May reallocated development
resources and added an addition-
al officer to the state to work the
donor base more frequently.
At Thursday night's event, the
focus willbe on engagingthe Uni-
versity's high level donors, and
May said he is surprised by the
event's expected turnout.
"We thought we were going to
have about 110 of our donors ...
but this time we're having 150, at
least," May said. "We're having a
spectacular response."
May said the larger than
expected showing is for three rea-
sons: well known New York real
estate mogul Stephen Ross will
host the event, the University's
regents will be in-house and the
event is being held at Jazz at the
Lincoln Center.
In addition, eight students
from the School of Music, The-
atre, and Dance are being flown to
New York to perform a few songs
for the gathering of donors.
The cost of the fundraising
event was not available at time
of publication, though the money
will come from Office of Develop-
ment funds.
"We want them (the donors)
to come, we want them to have
a good time, and then we'll talk
with them about what they can
do," May said. "Some of those
donors can do $25,000, but some
can do $500,000."
A breakfast planned for Fri-
day morning will be less showy
and focused on engaging the next
generation of donors. Mayand the
development team will shift gears
slightly to engage 50 to 75 young-
er alumni who mightbe lookingto
make their first gift.
"Some of those people will be
the big donors in the next cam-
paign," May said.

CAUCASUS
FromPage1A
between Western Asia and East-
ern Europe. The country was
divided between the Russian
and Ottoman empires in the 19th
century and was persecuted
by the Ottomans during War
World I. Before the Soviet Union
conquered Armenia in 1920, 1.5
million ethnic Armenians were
systematically exterminated by
the Turks during the Armenian
Genocide. In recent decades,
according to the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, Armenia has
undergone economic growth.
Saparov focused on the ethnic
conflicts within the Caucasus.
The Bolsheviks - the leading,
leftist party in Russia after the
fall of the Russian Empire in
1917 - redefined the borders
in Armenia in the early 20th
century. The meddling is often
blamed for creating ethnic strife
in the European nation. Sapa-
rov delved into the Bolsheviks'
mindset and intentions while
creating borders.
In his lecture, he also ana-
lyzed the Caucasus Mountains
region from a broader perspec-
tive, spanning across centuries
of history.
"You need to look at the bigger
picture to see how small events
fit into the bigger picture," Sapa-
rov said.
Saparov arguedthat the Sovi-
ets' actions are not as sinister as
commonlyunderstood.

"If you zoom in at the close
conditions you start realizing
that this is actually the result of
a number of decisions taken by
people tryingto solve immediate
problems - it's not a long term
predetermined process," Sapa-
rov said.
Kathryn Babayan, director of
the Armenian Studies Program,
said she hopes events such as
these serve to generate public
interest in Armenia.
"One of the things that we
try to do is to create an intel-
lectual community that reaches
out beyond just those who are
studying Armenian history or
literature but actually reaches to
a global faculty as well as under-
graduates," Babayan said.
Rackham student Vahe
Sahakyan, a Ph.D. candidate in
Near Eastern Studies, said he
was impressed with Saparov's
angle.
"This was a unique approach
that Arsene takes because it
looks at the whole region, not
into a specific country," Sahaky-
an said.
Engineering junior Antonina
Malyarenko attended the lec-
ture with a mission to gain more
knowledge on the Caucasus.
"Every day in class we have to
talk about current events and a
lot of these particular things are
still going on - like the conflicts
and stuff - so I'd personally like
to learn more so I can have more
of a background to talk about in
class."

From Page 1A
ages is perhaps due to the system
Ann Arbor currently has in place
to deal with inclement winter
weather. Like most cities, Ann
Arbor has a fleet of salt trucks and
plows that it sends out on specific
routes to deal with winter weath-
er.
The vehicles are sent out on two
shifts: one lasting from 1 p.m. to
6 a.m., and one lasting from 6 a.m.
to 2 p.m. During heavier snow-
falls, the service vehicles will take
two 12-hour shifts.
Plow crews' first priority is
snow removal on major streets
that are considered essential
routes for emergency vehicles and
traffic. Only second to that are
residential roads. The city also

spreads a de-icing agent, com-
posed ofboth sand and salt, across
roughly 98 miles of roadway.
However, the city is not respon-
sible for clearing most sidewalks.
Rather, it is the duty of residents
and business owners to clear side-
walks around their property. City
ordinance states that residents
have 24 hours to clear the side-
walks after a snowfall of greater
than 1 inch.
Kellar said enforcement of the
sidewalk regulations is difficult
because the city does not have
workers to monitor sidewalks.
"It requires public participa-
tion to enforce," Kellar said. "We
ask people to either call us or go
online ... to help fix that."
He added that the city has
developed a social media presence
and does a sufficient job respond-
ing and listening to citizens via

online platforms.
The city does not pay for snow
removal and street maintenance
from property proceeds, but
instead uses state funding to pay
for the programs. Kellar noted
this common misconception, and
said since state funding has not
increased since 1997, the city has
been held back from increasing its
capacity to remove snow.
"We get a lot of people asking
us: 'Why don't you buy more snow
plows or get more people on the
roads?' " Kellar said. "Well, that's
because we get the money from
the state to pay for that."
Councilwoman Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) said the cleanup pro-
cess is much better than it was
just five years ago, and credited
the new City Administrator Steve
Powers as well as a much more
"assertive" sidewalk process as

the primary agents of change.
"I think having a city admin-
istrator from Marquette, where
they really know how to deal with
snow, has been a real plus for us
and the community," Briere said.
"I also think the fact that the
city administrator is now talking
about looking at how we did and
improving on it for next winter is
also a real plus."
Briere also noted the contrast
in public opinion between when
she first began her tenure on city
council and now.
"I got constant complaints
about how days after a snowfall
somebody's neighborhood would
not have been plowed," Briere
said. "People now are impatient
because their neighborhood
hasn't been plowed in five hours."

Survivors look for
closure, reparations
from church
CHICAGO (AP) - The release
of 6,000 pages of documents
by the Archdiocese of Chicago
raised hopes Wednesday among
sex abuse victims and their
lawyers that new light will
be shed on what the Catholic
Church knew and did - or didn't
do - about decades of allegations
against priests.
The nation's third-largest
archdiocese handed over to vic-
tims' attorneys a trove of com-
plaints, personnel documents
and other files for about 30
priests with substantiated abuse
allegations, as part of settle-
ments with the victims.
The lawyers, who have fought
for years to hold the church
accountable for concealing
crimes and sometimes reassign-
ing priests to positions where
they continued to molest chil-
dren, said they expect to make
the documents public next week.
While church officials called
the agreement an effort to "bring
healing to the victims and their
families," the victims said the
disclosures and transparency
were the only way to learn from
what happened, make sure it is
never repeated and help both
them and the church recover and
move forward.
"Hopefully it will help oth-
ers out there struggling to come
forward and get help," said Joe
Iacono, 62, a Springfield, Ill.,
resident who was abused in the
early 1960s while he was a stu-
dent at a Catholic school outside
Chicago.
Iacono said he was hoping the

documents include records relat-
ing to the priest who abused him.
A ranking official for the arch-
diocese, Bishop Francis Kane,
opened a Wednesday news con-
ference explaining the document
release by apologizing for the
abuse.
"I have seen firsthand the pain
and suffering of the victims and
their families," Kane said. "What
we are doing now, I hope that it
will bringhealing and hope to the
people thatchave been affected by
these terrible sins and crimes."
Archdiocese attorney John
O'Malley warned that the docu-
ments will be "upsetting." "The
information is painful; it's dif-
ficult to read, even without the
benefit of hindsight," O'Malley
said.
The documents are similar
to recent disclosures by other
dioceses in the U.S. that showed
how the church shielded priests
and failed to report child sex
abuse to authorities. Church
officials said most of the abuse
occurred before 1988 and none
occurred after 1996.
Cardinal Francis George,
who has led the archdiocese
since 1997, did not attend the
news conference. But on Sun-
day he released a letter of apol-
ogy to parishioners that said all
incidents were reported to civil
authorities and resulted in settle-
ments.
In fact, the archdiocese has
paid about $100 million to settle
sex abuse claims, including those
against Father Daniel McCor-
mack, who was sentenced to
five years in prison after plead-
tog guilty in 2007 to abusing five
children while he was a parish
priest and a teacher at a Catholic
school.


FLU
From Page 1A
munity is worried it will be "mod-
erately severe," which would
be similar to the severity of last
year's season.
However, she said there is one
crucial difference from last year's
season: young, otherwise healthy
people are more disproportion-
ately affected than usual.

"When you talk about those
cases in the intensive care unit,
most of those folks are young and
healthy," Wells said. "So what
they have in common was ... a lot
of them didn't get vaccinated."
The strain in question, H1N1, is
another reason why more young
adults are catching the flu this
year. It's still unclear why young-
er populations are more suscep-
tible to the strain, but there are
some hypotheses that came out

of studying the 2009 pandemic of
the same strain.
"It does appear that this
H1Nt strain has some similari-
ties to strains from the 1950s,"
said Wells. "So those people that
are in their 60s or over possibly
have some cross reaction or cross
immunity with this H1N1 strain."
She added that this possibility
shouldn't keep anyone from get-
ting vaccinated.
"Myparents are intheir80s. I'd

be terrified if they weren't vacci-
nated, because that doesn't mean
they won't get it," she said. "They
just have a decreased chance of
getting it."
Wells added that it won't be too
late to get vaccinated until flu sea-
son calms down sometime around
March. The Center for Disease
Control recommends anyone
over the age of 6 months get vac-
cinated.

Life after parole
Michigan bill will certify parolee employment eligibility
In recent years, Michigan parolees have faced tremendous difficulty
gradually re-integratinginto society. Specifically, many ex-convictshave
endured trouble in attaining employment - one of the most important
steps to prevent recidivism. From 2001 to 2012, Michigan encountered a 30
percent decline in parolee employment . With tarnished reputations, these
parolees are stigmatized by past criminal activity that may not be indicative
of their current capabilities or work ethic. To address the employment crisis
among former inmates, Michigan legislators are prepared to install a bill
package that issues a certificate of employment for eligible parolees. The state
should not delay the bill's passage, as it would help alleviate the problems
faced by former convicts.

A profession in crisis

Almost a decade ago, a sin-
gle question completely
changed my life.
Sitting in
my catechism
classroom with
a dozen other
5th graders, we
had just finished
discussing some
Biblical story
and the instruc- JAMES
tor was taking BRENNAN
a short break to
transition to our
next subject. I raised my hand and
she called on me.
"How do we know any of this is
real?" I asked.
This question was not some type
of challenge to authority or cross-
examination- itjustseemed natural
that I should ask for confirmation
about all of these fantastic stories I
was being exposed to. Rather than
my teacher citing historical record
or some scientific study - which
was forsome reason what I expected
her to do - she simply responded
by saying, "We just have to believe.
That's what it means to have faith.
You just believe."
All of a sudden my perceptions
of God, religion and the meaning of
life were completely shattered. By
the time I reached middle school
I had completed my transition to
agnosticism, on my way to full-
blown atheism.
It allstarted with a single question,
one that challenged the status quo
and, in essence, authority.
Today, American political and
media culture seems far too afraid
of these types of questions. I'm not
talking about questions challenging
religion, but rather questions that
ask for hard verification of what
we're all told every day. Journalists
and citizens alike take to many
statements at face value, backing
down from challenging people in
power and asking them to verify
what they claim. Despite an
established history of government

Last week, the Michigan legislators
introduced a three-bill package that would
allow the Department of Corrections to
issue a certificate of employability to inmates
based on their criminal history, training,
skills, behavioral record and education. The
certificates aim to vouch for parolees' good
moral character and ability to engage in the
work force. With the certificate, employers are
immune from negligent-hiringlawsuits.
Ex-criminals and society alike would benefit
from higher parolee employment. Studies have
shown that increasing parolee employment
would significantly mitigate future criminal
activity. The reincarceration rate of employed
parolees is 63 percent less than of those who
are unemployed. Parolees being reincarcerated
creates unnecessary prison maintenance
which can rack up several millions according
to Citizens Alliance on Prisons and Public
Spending, a third-party organization that
vouches for prisoners' rights. CAPPS executive
director Laura Sager wrote that almost 30
percent of inmates who have been denied
parole are in the lowest risk category for
release. The inefficiency of the parole system
is detrimental to both parolees who deserve
fairer sentencing and to Michigan citizens who

pay taxes that to maintain crowded prisons.
Iowa and Ohio have already passed similar
legislation that issue employment certification
to qualified parolees. Both states require
parolees to demonstrate commitment and
desire to re-enter the work force in order
to be eligible for the certificate. Attaining
the certificate validates former inmates'
exceptional performance while underthe states'
supervision. The parolee employment license
upholds government-approved standards
that would ensure the safety of employers
and companies. Already, Ohio has shown
improvement in parolee re-incarceration rates.
Parolee employment certification would
undoubtedly reduce recidivism and prison
costs, and fill unwanted low-entry occupations.
However, lawmakers should be careful not to
discriminate among the various types of crimi-
nals. As it stands, the certificate of employment
seems to have a preference for white-collar and
non-violent offenders. Violent offenders should
also have the opportunity to earn the certifi-
cate if the rigorous and stringent evaluation
standards are enforced. Taking these consid-
erations in mind, Michigan should adopt the
policy and effectively improve the quality of life
for an oft-forgotten underclass in the state.

Shifting the power

Does anyone remember "Spanglish"? That
somewhat serious, sappy film starring Adam
Sandler about the unorthodox relationship
a wealthy American family has with its
Mexican housekeeper? I do. I was 11 years
old, and I remember watching it in theaters
with my mom. The narrator of the film is the
housekeeper's daughter, Cristina Moreno,
who recaptures the summer she stayed with
her mother's employers in her application
essay to Princeton University. As the movie
progressed, I felt captivated by Cristina's
character. In the funny moments, I laughed
with her; inthesadder moments, Iempathized
with her. By the end of the movie, I wanted
to be just like her. At one point during the
movie, I remember turning to my mom and
telling her I wanted to go to Princeton now.
My mother replied that I could achieve this
goal so long as I worked really, really hard.
This dream of mine - to work really, really
hard - only evolved as my middle and high-
school years progressed. The image of Cris-
tina stuck with me in the back of my head. She
became a model for how I should live my life
and what my priorities should be.
Ten years later, what model of women are
we projecting to young girls? I'm afraid that
young girls today are not exposed to decent
young female figures like Cristina, or even
the more widely popular role model Elle
Woods from "Legally Blonde." Even though
Elle - our much adored childhood female
role model - valued many of the same super-
ficial things as reality stars like the Kardashi-
ans, an education ultimately transforms her.
She learns to instill in herself the values of
hard work and intelligence. In the end, Elle
ends up ditching her scum of a man, shifts her
focus to the practice of law and diverts her
attention to other hard working, passionate
people more worthy of her time and energy.
Girls today are instead exposed to young
female figures such as Kylie Jenner. Jenner
is a teenager who earned her success for
no reason other than her wealth, physical
appearance and familial connection to her
reality-star sisters. With models such as
Kylie Jenner and the Kardashians, young
girls of today are lacking inspirational female

characters with solid values.
You go to the University of Michigan, which
means you must have worked hard to get
here. You must have stayed up late junior year
of high school, tirelessly working through
sample ACT math problems. Senior year, late
nights were spent picking apart your Com-
mon App essay until it was perfect. And so
somewhere along the way, you began to value
hard work and intelligence, seeing a link
between these two qualities and success. But
by watching shows featuring female charac-
ters who lack these qualities - even when it's
just when you're folding your laundry - you
are endorsing and even promoting the kind
of female figure the Jenners or Kardashians
represent. The very reason these characters
- and yes, they are characters, reality TV
doesn't make them any more real - are get-
ting so much airtime and attention is because
we are giving it to them. Popular media only
creates these caricatures of women and per-
petuates this image of the female role model
because, by watching their shows, reading
their blogs and following them on Twitter, we
are saying it's OK to do so.
Now I know these female characters are
addicting as hell to watch. When I was in 10th
grade, I think I watched the Real Housewives
of New Jersey's Theresa and her table-flipping
scene at least a dozen times. But as alluring and
entertaining as these women can be to watch,
we owe it to ourselves, and to society, to begin
tuning them out. We certainly don't hold the
same values these female characters are rep-
resenting, and so we shouldn't promote them.
What sort of values and principles do you hope
your brother's kid or that little girl you baby-
sit acquire? Do you want her to want tobe like
Kylie Jenner, or do you want her to want to
be like the funny and charmingly nerdy mid-
dle-child Alex on Modern Family - the only
respectable figure I have seen on TV as of late.
Realize that just by switching the channel you
have the power to shift the popularized image
of the female figure from that of the Kardashi-
ans to one that young girls, like you once were,
can look up to.

humans in to," Grizzle said.
The team began their work
with MABF.iL an earlier and
slightly more primitive version
of MARLO - whose hips only
moved forwards and backwards.
This version of the robot could not
provide its own lateral stabiliza-
tion and was confined to walking
or running in circle, irrsil the lab
attached to a boom.
MARLO, however, can walk in
all directions attached only to a
safety cable that prevents it from
toppling over and breaking when
it loses balance. This improved
ability to balance allowed the
tearm to take MARLO for a test
run outside the lab. On one chilly
day in early December, MARLO
firrally saw the light of day.
"We'd done the length of the
lab 25 or 30 times, but these
robots are eventually supposed to
be able to go outside and handle
real walking situations," Grizzle
said. "lie Saturday morning we
took a siot at it, and it almost

to the project because of the way

MAR O t'r'hing a child how
to walk.
"A child is born with limbs and
muscles, but can't walk until it
learns how," he said. "The pro-
grarnming part we've done con-
sists of figuring out what to do
with six motors and sensors that
measures angles if' the robot is
leaningover."
Buss said balance is a trickier
thing to accomplish than most
people realize. It's not as simple as
sore tay think; when compared
to M A R LO. humans have the

advantage of nerves that detect
pressure and tipping angles, eyes
to see where they're going and
flexible ankles that can correct
balance issues.
The team plans to install high-
performance internal measuring
units on MARLO to give the robot
an even better sense of balance.
Currently, devices at the ankles
measure forces on the ground
while others calculate the angle of
the body. However, these devices
aren't foolproof and MARLO still
trips over itself from time to time.
Jill Petkash, an orthotic and
prosthetic technician at Universi-
ty Hospital, started working with
the team last September to select
prosthetic feet that would pro-
vide the robot with more stability.
She ultimately helped fit MARLO
with College Park's Tribute model
prosthetic. The company agreed
to donate the feet to the project
free of charge.
The 'Tribute Foot is designed
for human amputees, giving
MARLO a more human-like gait.
in addition, a series of clamps
and tubes that attach the feet to
the end of the robot's legs act as a

sort of shin bone, and provide an
increased range of motion even
though the ankle is fixed with
respect to the rest of the leg.
These clamps and tubes will
also simplify the process of
switching out prosthetic feet,
should the team choose to do so.
"MARLO is astandard produc-
tion prosthetic item, so if they
wanted lighter weight or more
high performance materials, they
could easily do that by just using
standard componentry," Petkash
said.
MARLO is a completely cus-
tomized machine, and its creators
are still working to come up with
better designs. But even when the
programming team works until
the early hours of the morning,
getting to test and perfect their
ideas is just one enjoyable part of
the job.
"The really fun days are when
we have a particular design that
we want to try, like a new idea
for controlling or improving con-
trol of the robot," Buss said. "It's
excitingto see the robot work andr
get people excited about it."

With talent and veteran leaders,
Wolverines poised for title run

Calm, composed,
Grajales finds roll

By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
As defending NCAA champi-
ons, the unanimous preseason
No.1 and hosts of the 2014 NCAA
Championship, much is expect-
ed of this year's Michigan men's
gymnastics team.
The Wolverines return 26
of 30 routines from last year -
most belongingto gymnasts that
are All-Americans, individual
National Champions or Olym-
pians. Armed with talent across
the board, Michigan head coach
Kurt Golder has his choice of
lineups he can employ any time.
"This year is a little bit differ-
ent because no matter what our
lineup is, we are capable of win-
ning every single meet," Golder
said. "So I've put a little more
emphasis on winning the Windy
City (invitational) and winning
every single meet between now
and the NCAA finals."
If Michigan is able to win in
Chicago and repeat as National
Champions, it will be the first
time a team has accomplished
this feat since Oklahoma
repeated in 2005, and the first
time since 1959 that a Michigan
team has won back-to-back
National Championships.
The chance at making history,
though, isn't weighing heavily on
the Wolverines. This team views
its season as an opportunity to
cement its own legacy and not
just live off last season's success.

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Junior Stacy Ervin is one of several uperclassmen expected to lead Michigan back to the NCAA Tournament this year.

"We talked quite a bit when
the new year came around,
'OK we're no longer NCAA
champions, we're nothing,"'
Golder said. "Everything we
want to accomplish lies in front
of us. We have to earn it."
Perhaps winning this season
will meanevenmore asMichigan
hosts the NCAA Championships
at Crisler Center for the first
time since 1971.
"I think (hosting the NCAA
Championship) adds motivation,
and I also think it adds pres-
sure," Golder said. "And we have
to be able to deal with that pres-
sure."
One person who is used to
that pressure is graduate stu-
dent Syque Caesar. A fifth-year
senior last year, Caesar was able
to get a sixth year of eligibil-
ity because he had two previous
seasons lost to injuries and he is
still taking classes.
"Coming back off a
championship last year and
retaining something like 90
percent of the team and all of our
routines, and the fact that we are
hostingNCAA's this year, it willbe
like a fairy-tale story if we execute
and win the championship at
home," Caesar said.
Caesar, who represented

Bangladesh in the 2012 summer
Olympics, earned three All-
American honors last year in
floor exercise, parallel bars and
high bar. He will also serve as
captain again this year, along
with senior Matt Freeman.
The other Olympian on the
team, senior Sam Mikulak,
will also be depended on
to contribute heavily to the
Wolverines success. After
last year's performance at the
NCAA championships - which
included NCAA individual
Championships in all-around,
high bar and parallel bar and six
All-American honors - Mikulak
has a chance to become the most
decorated NCAA gymnast ever.
With 13 All-American
citations and five NCAA
individual championships,
Mikulak needs only three more
individual championships and
four All-American citations to
become the record holder in
both categories.
But for Mikulak, one of his
biggest obstacles might be fellow
teammate, junior Adrian de los
Angeles. De los Angeles finished
second to Mikulak's first in the
all-around competition at both
the Big Ten Championships
and the NCAA Championships.

Additionally, de los Angeles
earned All-American honors on
the parallel bars last year.
Yet, Michigan will need other
contributors besides these three
as it heads into its first meet of
the season, the Windy City Invi-
tational. Waiting for the Wolver-
ines in Chicago will be a stacked
lineup that includes Big Ten foes
No. 4 Ohio State, No. 5 Illinois,
No. 8 Iowa and No. 9 Minnesota.
Though the favorites to win
the invitational, Michigan
could be without two of its top
gymnasts, Mikulak, who is in
China for a Team USA training
camp, and junior Stacey Ervin,
who has had recent back
problems and will be a day-time
decision to compete.
But, not even these potential
setbacks have dampened the
Wolverines' expectations head-
ing into the meet.
"We set our goals at wanting
to win Windy City," Caesar said.
"We want to win that title right
away because it really sets the
tone for the rest of the season."
Whether or not the Wolver-
ines accomplish their first goal
with a win in Chicago, there is
no doubt that Michigan will have
the chance to reach unparalleled
heights this new year.

. In a sport where the goal is to
break your opponent, a Michigan
wrestler is finding success
using happiness and pride for
motivation.
"I'm not usually the kind
of person that wants to get all
angry or too hyped up," said
fifth-year senior Eric Grajales.
"I like to be happy and smile
before my matches."
After a 15-1 campaign in his
redshirt junior year, Grajales has
had a successful first half of this
2013 season, climbing to 12th
in the InterMat rankings of the
149-pound weight class. And all
of this success is coming under a
unique mindset.
He believes that a wrestler has
to have an attitude to succeed, and
that being angry isn't the answer
for everyone. During duels, the
only people that aren't sitting
on the bench, outside of the next
wrestler waiting to compete,
are usually the coaches - and
Grajales. He takes an involved
role in the motivation of other
Wolverine wrestlers by standing
on the sideline and encouraging
them through the matches.
One standout example of this
was a moment shared between
the veteran and freshman
heavyweight Adam Coon. In a
meet last week against Purdue,
Coon was preparing to take the
mat and continue his undefeated
season. Seeing Coon looking
tense, Grajales stood up and made
his way to the anxious freshman.
"I wanted to give Coon a high-
five and congratulate him on how
well he's about to do," Grajales
said. "I know he's about to go out
there and do well, so I wanted to
make sure he's happy and knows

I'm happy."
Coon took the win by more
than 10 points.
There are other leaders on the
team, but none have a greater
opportunity to affect the overall
outcome than Grajales does. As
a squad, one of the mosh crippling
problemsNo. 19 Michigan has had
this year is getting out to a solid
start early in meets, which puts
Grajales, who wrestles in the 149-
pound weight class, in a perfect
position to restore the calm for the
Wolverines. Time and time again
he has given the team the jump-
start that they need to come out
on top in matches.
Grajales, one of only two
seniors with a starting role, is ina
position that he didn't necessarily
anticipate coming into the season.
In early December, redshirt junior
and team captain Max Huntley
went down for the year with a torn
pectoral tendon. With only four
seniors on the team, somebody
needed to step up, and Grajales
was the answer.
OutsideoftheinjurytoHuntley,
it was going to be important for
Grajales to continue to lead the
way and spread his leadership
style to the young team.
The Wolverines are ranked
19th in the latest poll, but face
an immediate opportunity to
climb the ladder with four ranked
opponents on the schedule
over the next three weekends,
including No. 11 Illinois and No.
2 Minnesota this weekend. In a
month's time it should be fairly
clear just how well Grajales'
innovative leadership style is
leading the Wolverine charge.
With such a daunting confer-
ence schedule in the team's future,
the Wolverines can use a smile
wherever they can get it. Grajales
will be sure to provide just that.

West Lafayette Story: Wolverines
upset Purdue in key Big Ten win

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
On Wednesday night at Purdue,
with 14:25 left in the second half,
fans of the Michigan women's
basketball team held their breath.
Junior for-
ward Cye- MICHIGAN 65
sha Goree PURDUE 49
had been
charged with her fourth foul of
the game, forcing Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico to take the
strong playmaker out for almost
seven minutes.
The Wolverines stormed the
court at Mackey Arena early,
scoring eight unanswered points
in the first three minutes of the
game, due much in part to the
rebounding effort of Goree.
Without her height and hustle
on the court, Michigan could've
crumhled under pressure and
relinquished their lead.
But for a teamthat continuously
overcomes adverse situations in
critical games, crumbling would
have been out of character.
For a full 40 minutes, the Wol-
verines (3-1 Big Ten, 12-5 overall)
forced Purdue to play catch-up.
The Boilermakers (1-3,11-5) failed
to close the gap, giving Michi-
gan its first victory over a top-25
ranked team this season, 65-49.
The win marked a historic night
for the program - the Wolverines
have never beat Purdue in back-
to-back years in West Lafayette.
Despite never relinquishing
its lead, Michigan felt increased
pressure from the Boilermakers
throughout the second half, and
the Wolverines' substantial point
margin sunk to single digits. As
a result of 17 Michigan turnovers
throughout the game, Purdue
hung around, threatening the
Wolverines' upset.
"That's kind of been the
common theme," Barnes Arico
said. "If we don't get better at it,
we are going to be in trouble."
Michigan held a 39-37

rebounding advantage and had
10 steals along with seven blocks
in the contest. Goree filled up
her box score with eight points,
14 rebounds and two assists, and
junior forward Nicole Elmblad
grabbed six defensive and three
offensive boards, helping her
team dominate the glass in the
first half.
The Wolverines held Purdue
to 30 percent shooting from the
field and shut down its leading
scorers - guards Courtney
Moses and KK Houser. The pair
averages 31 points per game, but
combined for just 11on the night.
Moses, who has scored in double
digits in her last eight games, put
up eight and added two rebounds
Wednesday night.
"We started in a diamond-
and-one (defense) on Moses and
I think that kind of set the tone,"
Barnes Arico said. "We went back
to it later in the second half and
I think it really was a difference-
maker for us."
Freshman guard Siera Thomp-

son and junior forward Shannon
Smith made strong offensive con-
tributions, each scoring 12 points.
Thompson went 3-for-6 from
deep while Smith came through
at the free-throw line, going
4-for-4. Michigan shot 45 per-

"That was definitely the big-
gest shot of the game," Barnes
Arico said. "She hit a couple big
shots tonight. She hit her free
throws which was tremendous,
but that shot right there was
really key."
Ristovski stepped up and
continuously attacked the basket,
keeping the Wolverines out of
trouble on the scoreboard for
most of the second half. She led
the team in scoring with 17 points
- 12 of which came in the second
half - going 4-for-4 on free
throws and 3-for-5 from beyond
the arc.
Michigan's scoring runs
allowed them to overcome peri-
ods of offensive lapses. It finished
the game as Purdue fans quietly
drudged out of Mackey, dismayed
that their team now holds a mea-
sly 1-3 record in the Big Ten. For
the Wolverines, who just accrued
their third conference win and
third consecutive road win, the
good times continue to roll.

Once a "worst-case scenario," Kevin
Lohan finds way back onto the ice

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
Kevin Lohan wants to play.
And he wants to play now.
Sidelined since Nov. 1 with a
torn lateral meniscus, the fresh-
man defenseman has watched
from the bench as the Michigan
hockey team climbed the nation-
al rankings and then struggled
through a four-game losing
streak that will span nearly a
month before the 13th-ranked
Wolverines compete again.
But he won't play next week
when Michigan (2-2 Big Ten,
10-6-2 overall) continues its
conference slate with a series
against Michigan State. He may
not even see the ice the week
after that, when the Wolver-
ines welcome No. 9 Wisconsin
to Yost Ice Arena. According to
Michigan coach Red Berenson,
there's no guarantee Lohan will
ever regain the spot he held at

the beginning of the season,
which has since been supplant-
ed to various degrees of success.
If Lohan had his way instead
of Berenson or the team doctor,
he'd dress for next Thursday's
game against the Spartans.
"I've gotta wait for the
doctor," Lohan said. "It's not up
to me at this point."
Right now, Lohan says he's
at about 90 percent - while the
recovery process has been long
and arduous, he's progressing
well ahead of schedule. On Nov.
5, Berenson said the injury was
a "worst-case scenario" and
that it would take at least three
months until the defenseman
had a chance to play again.
"He's doing really well,"
Berenson said. "He's pretty
close to going all-out."
And for a while, it was as dif-
ficult as Berenson predicted.

"I guess you could say I got

said. "If you were to get hurt,

On Dec. 25, Lohan finally
made his return to the ice,
participating in Michigan's two
practices that day for the Great
Lakes Invitational. Though the
team spent the day practicing,
it felt like a Christmas present
to him.
At 6-foot-5 and 200-plus
pounds, Lohan is far from an
agile skater, making his return
to game form more difficult.
Even though Lohan feels ready
to compete, doctors are still
keeping him from participating
in some full-contact drills.
Wearing a white jersey in
practice Wednesday, Lohan
joined his teammates in board-
to-board sprints. On one skate
down the ice, the freshman fin-
ished last among a group of four
teammates. Holding his stick
behind his neck, he hunched
over for breath, all with a smile.
"It feels really good to get
back out there," he said. "I've
slowly been working my way up
to the more intense activities."

I'M A 1ST
YEAR STUDENT

SHOULD I ATTEND
WINTER CAREER EXPO?

20+ "freshmen friendly" organizations are coming to see you!
Y S Plan to attend the Freshmen Orientation and learn how to:
* best navigate the fair
o find employers interested in meeting 1st and 2nd year students
* chat with employers and ask questions
" approach an employer with confidence
Freshmen Orientation is offered each day at Expo: 3pm, 4pm or 5pm

WHO'S COMING TO EXPO?
This is the most common question about Expo and the answer is pretty
straightforward: the list of organizations is available on the Winter Career Expo
website. The trick, though, is what you do with the list. Here are some tips:
Tip 1
Almost 100 organizations makes for a long list! To make it more manageable
start by searching the list by "Type of Position (full-time or internship).
Tip 2
Don't miss out on great opportunities! Look at the organization description
and the job description. The organization description tells you what they do;
the job description tells you what they're looking for: the connection is not
always obvious.
For example: BrightEdge Technologies "is the global leader in enterprise
SEO, helping more than 6,000 of the world's largest brands stay ahead in the
rapidly evolving Internet landscape." At first glance you might think they're
recruiting technical majors... they are actually recruiting all majors for account
executive positions.
Tip 3
Connect the job description to your own story: your experiences, interests,
skills (the things you're good at). This will give you specific examples to use
when speaking with Expo recruiters.
Tip4
Use the filters to review the list by location, degree level and more.

our pre-architecture classes together give stu-

of like a litmus test - if you have a personal-
ity that needs to know if something is right or
wrong, Taubman may be tough. It doesn't hide
from the fact that problems are multifaceted
with many solutions, so you have to be really
flexible in your thinking."
Drawing classes typically build on a series of
exercises. Students may be asked to draw a sea-
shell placed before them, or a wood block - and
then again with fewer lines. Rather than merely
learn how to draft, the goal of the classes is to
teach students to question their work.
"If you draw a particular subject 20 times, you
don't see it the same way anymore. Students
finish the semester with the analytical tools to
view their environment with completely dif-
ferent eyes," Harris said.

Restaurant

that offers

some do a "two for," in which
case lunch would effectively be
$7.50 and dinner $14.
As usual, there are tons of

finally did. Don't let the awk-

an apparent dead-end fool you;
though the seating is indeed
below ground, the quality of the
food is sky-high (groan). The
salmon - prepared in the style
of a beef wellington sans pate -
was decadent, but the sauteed
duck breasts stole the show. The
glaze of duck fat, brandy, apples,
cider, brown sugar and raisins

playful twist on the "everything"

The roasted white bean soup with

Harris, who has been teach-
ing at Taubman since 1990, also
coordinates the first-year studio
classes. Studio classes take place
in Taubman'sopen studio space on
the third floor of the Art & Archi-
tecture Building, the largest of its
kind in the world. At one time, as
many as 500 students could be at
work in the vast space. It's a flurry
of activity and discussion, and its
white walls are covered in stu-
dents'works-in-progress.
Lasting four hours, yet allot-
ted six credits, studio classes are
staple of a Taubman education.
The classes always consist of
12 students and their professor,
ensuring intimacy and individual
attention, and are project-based
rather than test-oriented.
"Studios were my favorite
classes,"said Gerry Kleiner, a 2010
alumnus of Taubman who also
works in the college's admissions.
"You learn as much from your
peers as from your teacher and
get to know all of them very well.
It's asupportgroup - almost like a
family."
For each project, students must
give a presentation as a part of a
review of their work, and receive
feedback from both classmates
and a panel of professors in the
studio. The collaborative nature
reflects Taubman's studio culture
as a whole: The studio is never
empty, and students can be found
working in its cavernous interior
any hour of the day or night. It
becomes a home away from home,
where students eat, sleep, watch
Netflix, and even work. Every stu-
dent has a personal desk.
"Architecture should be fun,
and even if you're spending anight
in the studio working, the com-
munity atmosphere in the studio
embraces you," Hazle said. "You
can always engage classmates in
discussion and ask, 'Hey, this is
my idea. Does it make sense?"'
Studio classes extend beyond
design, with assignments often
emphasizing the personal vision
of the student. The works pinned
up on the studio walls are often
abstract sketches, not just pristine
drawings of buildings. Kleiner
studied the muscles of the human
body for three weeks to incorpo-
rate the research into a project on
tessellation.
"By the end of the first stu-
dio, students are really looking
at how an idea takes shane in a

Looking to live a
'Year of Nio Fear'

built world," Kleiner said. "They
realize that they can take a point
of view. They ask, 'Can architec-
ture move people in a particular
way?'"
Outside the classroom
"My favorite experience at
Taubman was a studio trip to New
York City during my senior year. I
learned an incredible amount in
3 days," Kleiner said. The profes-
sor toured her students at 3 firms,
introduced them to colleagues
and explored a hidden side of
Manhattan.
"We found out, for example,
that New York City actually sits
on many fault lines."
Studio trips are not atypi-
cal at Taubman. Professors have
taken classes to Alaska, Kentucky
and even Iceland. The location
is dependent upon the instruc-
tor, whom students choose after
viewing their presentations.
Ranking their top choices, stu-
dents match themselves with
professors whose fields of study
interest them the most.
"Taubman really fosters acom-
munity. To build a building is the
epitome of a team effort, after all,"
Harris said.
"Architecture is intrinsically
collaborative," Kleiner added.
The opportunities extend to
study abroad and research pro-
grams, which allow even first-
year students to accompany
professors on an off-campus proj-
ect, whether to Chicago or over-
seas. For the more career-focused
student, Taubman provides
externships over spring break at
firms in major cities. Qualified
students who apply are guaran-
teed placement.
On campus, networking events
and lecture series heln further

career opportunities. Taubman
has over 8000 total alumni, many
of whom visit their alma mater for
lunchtime meet-and-greets with
current students, discussing their
career paths or the nontraditional
ways in which they are usingtheir
architecture degree. Taubman's
weekly lecture series invites
guestspeakers to discuss a variety
of topics, such as their research or
a book they've recently published.
Because of Taubman's small
size, it can provide students with
opportunities to meet profession-
als.
"I usually go to all of the lec-
tures," Hazle said. "Each one is
fascinating."
Resources
Aside from the academic offer-
ings Taubman also boasts some of
the country's best digital technol-
ogy and laboratory equipment.
Any student has access to Taub-
man's Digital Fabrication Lab
(FABLab), which uses robots and
other advanced manufacturing
processes to test materials and
concepts for commercial use.
However, Taubman's resources
aren't limited to its tools.
"People may say what sets
Taubman apart is our FABLab,
but for me that's a very flat
answer, because that's just equip-
ment," Harris said. "It's the minds
that run the equipment that are
our true resources."
Each year, Taubman provides
three fellowships to the country's
top young talentin architecture to
help them their teaching careers.
Studentsabenefit from their proac-
tive professors, who strive to find
new and better ways to teach. For
these fellows, their interest isn't
only architecture. It's figuring out
the bestwayto bring architecture
alive for students.
Aside from fellowships, the col-
lege also offers substantial grants
to faculty, including a $20,000
internal grant that professors
can utilize for research projects,
often engaging several students
to assist them. The Taubman pro-
gram is research-intensive over-
all, even down to the structure of
studio classes, and students may
not design anything until weeks
of research have been completed.
"What really sets Taubman
apart are the individual passions
of our faculty and their dedica-
tion to having conversation with
students," Harris continued. "We
teach how to diagram thought.
The emphasis at Taubman isn't
so much to simply have students
ready to produce drawings in an
office, but rather to create stu-
dents who ask questions. Why
are we making these decisions?
Why is this building organized
the way it is? Students emerge as
leaders."

Jts going to be a great year
for me, and it's not because
I have some superstitious
reason - though I did wear No. 14
for almost my entire soccer career
- and it's
definitely not
because I'm
going to prove
it to you by
accomplishing
some bucket
list that I was
prompted CARLY
to compose KEYES
because it's
Jan.1 again.
It's going
to be a great year because I'm
attempting to live a "Year of No
Fear." Well, the fear will always be
there, but I'm just choosing to say
"No" to it this year.
Being the all-or-nothing think-
er that I am, I have an awful ten-
dency to either entirely ignore my
emotions or allow them to take
full control of my mind and body.
I think that when we discuss
health, we focus so deeply on the
physical that we seldom consider
the emotional and mental states
that accompany physical short-
comings.
For me, the toughest of all emo-
tions to understand is fear. As a
personinlong-termrecovery,even
after three years, two months and
11 days of sobriety, fear can actu-
ally be a helpful motivator. I'll
always maintain a level of healthy
fear of relapsing and returning to
a life of active alcoholism - which
in my mind, at least, always leads
to jail, institutionalization and
death. I wholeheartedly fear these
consequences - two of which I've
already experienced - as I should.
But fear, itself, can foster terri-
ble consequences, too. A crippling
fear - of judgment, of rejection,
of failure - is like a monster that
will prevent me from achiev-
ing my dreams if I let it ... or I
can smash it to pieces each time
it rears it's ugly head in my face.
I've endured a lifelong struggle
as a slave to my fear, which until
recently has prevented me from
living the life I want.
Now, every fear conquered is
another step closer to becoming
the person I'm meant toube.
When I was in 1st grade, our
teacher asked us to draw a picture
of what we wanted to be when
we grew up. I drew a picture of
an artist (obviously, I thoroughly
enjoyed this assignment). Prior
to the natural disillusionment as
we inch closer and closer to "real
world" status, this is what I want-
ed; this is who I wanted to be.
over the recent holiday break,
I dove into old boxes of my pen-
cil drawings of everything from
Darth Vader and Boba Fett to
NHL hockey players to animals,
animals and more animals. There
were also original stories I'd
written and illustrated as class
assignments throughout elemen-
tary school. Myuntainted sense of
wonder and affinity for visual sto-
rytelling was vivid and palpable
on those pages. At that age, I had
zero reservations - no fear - over

LIGHT UP
Local tobacconist finds staing power

Maison Edwards
shop remains an Ann
Arbor fixture
ByELLIOT ALPERN
DailyArts Writer
Asmuch asthecityofAnnArbor
derives its personality or, at least,
itslivelihood fromits colorfularray
of downtown storefronts, there's
one truth about business that's
impossible to ignore: It's hard to
stay afloat. The seemingly immortal
icon Blimpy Burger closed its doors
this past autumn, and even giants
like Borders eventually reveal
themselves to be only temporary.
At first glance, then, it would
seem miraculous that a cozy little
shop could nestle away in Nick-
els Arcade for over 50 years. And
yet, the name Maison Edwards
has been a mainstay of the his-
toric walkway - "Tobacco & Cof-
fee," reads the unassuming sign,
"sought after since 1963." There's
nothing that shouts or gets in your
face about wanting your patronage.
Instead, Maison Edwards shows
passersby a wide array of straight-
razor kits, grooming products,
Zippo lighters and old-fashioned
cigarette advertisements. It's a
presentation that offers a subtle
and effective message: Letus pique
your curiosity, and before you
know it, you'll want to have a look
around.
And once you're in, it doesn't
take much more to become hooked.
Most days, if you happento stroll in
at the right time, you'll be greeted
by none other than Chuck Ghawi,
the owner and manager of Mai-
son Edwards. And after staying in
the store for just a few minutes, it's
easy to see how Maison remains a
fixture of Ann Arbor.
At one point during my time
there, a student walks in - Chuck
greets him by name. Seconds later,
the two are in deep conversation
about a blend of tobacco they refer

to as "wild sweet orient." The stu-
dent finds it too harsh, and they
move over to the pipe tobacco
blends, where eventually they set-
tle on something that might appeal
more. "If you don't like something,
I need to know so'I can write it
down for next time," Chuck tells
him as the purchase is being made.
It becomes clear that Chuck has
accomplished what most small
business owners dream of - he's
developed a dedicated clientele
of regulars, the ultimate coup for
what some may consider a niche
market.
According to Chuck, it's that
ability to develop a connection that
is his biggest boon: "I think (it's)
the relationship, which really is my
only asset - the credibilityIhave,"
Ghawi said.
That credibility is backed up by
Chuck's extensive personal expe-
rience with the store. Opened by
James and Augusta Edwards in
May of 1963, the tobacconist had
been in business for over 20 years
by the time Chuck began to work
there.
"I walked into here in 1986 as a
student and asked if they were hir-
ing,"Ghawisaid. "Three oldguys in
three piece suits all said 'no' to me
at the same time. So I got to know
Mrs. Edwards, who owned the
store next door and catered wom-
en's products, and she convinced
her husband to hire me part-time."
Chuck worked there until 1987
before he was hired to a corpo-
rate position out of college, but
he ended up returning to buy the
store in 1991.
"I really liked the store, I really
liked the area." Ghawi said. "It's
hard to find a shop anywhere like
this. It's something I liked to keep
going; it's not something I cre-
ated. What really makes it is the
diversity - the people who come
in here."
As if on cue, a sidewalk-busker
walks into the store strumming a
guitar - Chuck once again greets
him by name, asking how the

weather has been fairing. Once
the thrum of business dies down
a bit (and a couple of customers
have reclined to smoke their pur-
chases in the handful of chairs
around the room), Chuck guides
me through the intricacies of
tobacco.
The first tobaccos you're likely
to spot upon walking in is the
row of apothecary-size glass jars
that line a bar at the back of the
room - each numbered as a dif-
ferent blend of pipe tobacco. Here,
Chuck really shows that he knows
what he's talking about - first,
there are the "aromatics," clas-
sified by a greater proportion of
"shell casings" and flavoring. If
aromatics are the whole-grain
bread of tobacco, then non-aro-
matics are obviously the white
bread, with less overall casings
and flavor. Then, lastly, come the
English blends.
"They tend to be a bit heavier
on smokiness, so not usually
something a newcomer would
buy," Chuck tells me - or, essen-
tially, not usually something I
would buy.
When we move over to the
humidor which houses most ofthe
shops cigar selection, I ask hins
to guide me through a decision
as though I was a new customer
looking to get into the practice.
"I would give you a tour of the
different types of cigars we have,
the different countries of origin,"
he says, gesturing at the shelves
of cigar cases. "Dominican, Nica-
raguan, Honduran. I would steer
you toward a milder Dominican
cigar -" he selects one in front
of us after some consideration,
showing me one that seems to be
a lighter tan.
By this point, another regu-
lar in businessman attire has lit
a cigar and watches with some
semblance of amusement a few
feet away. Chuck moves between
the different cigar types rapidly
- darker Dominican "maduros,"
even darker Nicaraguan oscuros,

ligeros, or the deepest shade, the
"double ligeros."
"Is that a double ligero?" Chuck
asks the man.
"It is not, which is probably
good for me," the man answers,
grinning, and the two laugh in a
way that only those who share the
same passion can understand.
After the store dwindles to
just us three, Chuck remembers
something else to show me, and
unlocks a door behind the pipe-
tobacco bar, withdrawing a var-
nished mahogany box. The two
of us crane our necks at the small
collection of cigars, each perfectly
rolled with the kind of finesse and
attention that hints at luxury and
a substantial price tag.
"Those are beautiful," the man
to my right assesses as he's finish-
ing his own, which he refers to as
an "affordable Christmas cigar."
Chuck tells me that he began

smoking cigarettes, but has since
dropped them from his tobacco
diet.
"Cigarettes are kind of the junk
food of tobacco," he says. "Pipes,
or cigars, you don't inhale; there's
no sense of addiction to those.
When I'm working, (it's) a cigar,
when I'm home, a pipe ... (they're)
two different experiences. The
range of flavors with pipe tobac-
cos is huge - you don't have that
with a cigar."
Though Maison Edwards's
humidor is carefully stocked with
a wide selection of cigars, it's not
hard to see that the store puts as
much zeal - or even more - into
its pipe tobacco offerings. Blends
are mixed by none other than
Chuck himself - but don't expect
to find a recipe any time soon.
"I measure the different ingre-
dients, and then I mix them - I
can't tell you (which); they're

secret," says Chuck, as the man in
the suit listens and puffs contem-
platively. "The proportions, the
types make the differences. ... It
took a long time to put these reci-
pes together, and I think in most
tobacco shops, they mostly guard
their process."
"It's like how Emeril Lagasse
won't share his recipes either,"
agrees the man puffing his cigar,
and the two laugh as though
they're longtime friends. As
smalltime businesses like butch-
ers and grocers continue to fall
by the wayside, it's becoming
increasingly difficult to forge a
personal relationship with a local
store - and yet, here at Maison,
Chuck's business thrives off of it.
"Wonderful people come
through this store," says Chuck,
and then he laughs. "I spend more
time with some of them than I do
my family!"
