By CHRISTY SONG
Daily Staff Reporter
From slushies to frozen
yogurt to creating personalized
packs of beer, students have a
new option for their late-night
drug store needs. Following
months of renovations, Wal-
greens opened on the corner of
South State Street and North
University Avenue on Dec. 31.,
Across the street from Cen-
tral Campusthe two-story con-
venience store even matched its
interior decor to University col-

candy, cosmetics and other
necessities.
The first floor is primarily
devoted to snacks and drinks
but will soon include a cooler
for fresh, health-friendly foods
like sandwiches and salads.
The store also plans to pro-
vide a wider variety of produce
goods to serve students who are
unable to go to grocery stores.
The second floor consists
of mostly makeup, hair acces-
sories, toiletries and personal
items, including a small selec-
tion of kitchenware.
The store will face competi-
tion from CVS, just a short walk
down State Street. CVS, which
opened in March 2011, is also a
two-story pharmacy that car-

to largely the same pool of cus-
tomers.
Tracie Klotz, Walgreen's
store manager, said it has
always been her dream to set up
a store in the downtown area.
Because most employees are
alumni or University students,
she said it seemed natural to be
near campus.
Klotz wanted to keep some
of the building's heritage dur-
ing construction - such as
keeping its skylights - while
incorporating modern aspects
as well. She said she catered the
store decorations and inventory
to meet the needs and demands
of students.
Competing with CVS will
always be a factor, but Klotz

erately beat her competitors'
offerings, as the prices of the
products are fairly similar to
those of CVS and identical to
the other Walgreens locations
in Ann Arbor.
In order to incentivize cus-
tomers, Walgreens is currently
distributing coupons for $2 off
purchases of $10 and will have
their grand opening celebration
on Feb. 7.
"We can make anythinghap-
pen, so it's going to be demand-
based," Klotz said. "But we will
always have the necessities,
since we are a pharmacy. We
just want to see what we can do.
We want to be great.

Connector service
aims to encourage
engagement and
learning in Motor City
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily Staff Reporter
For students itching for a
Wednesday afternoon trek to
downtown Detroit, finding a ride
just got easier.
Beginning on Jan. 15, the MDe-
troit Center Connector will begin a
new Wednesday bus service from
Ann Arbor to Detroit.
Students will also be able to
reserve a spot on the bus starting
Jan. 13 through MDCC's website.
The website also notes if a bus is
not runningdue to harsh weather.
The Transforming Learning for
the Third Century Fund - part
of a $50 million grant campaign
designed to improve teaching
and learning at the University in
advance of the institution's 2017
bicentennial - has allowed the
MDCC to offer a free Wednesday
bus service along with the Friday

and Saturday bus services in oper-
ation since last semester.
Mike Morland, the University's
Detroit Center communications
director, said feedback on the
route's success prompted consid-
eration of an additional day.
"Our first semester was very
successful," Morland said. "We
received a lot of feedback from
people saying how much they
enjoyed the service and how it
definitely improved their quality
and their mission of whatever they
were looking to do whether it was
to visit Detroit, work in Detroit or
even hop on abus to come home."
This summer, an initial sur-
vey sent to students showed that
Wednesday was a popular day for
students interested in the bus ser-
vice, in addition to Fridays and
Saturdays. Additional surveys
were distributed this fall, and
Wednesday again received sub-
stantial interest.
The Michigan Detroit Center,
the drop-off location for MDCC
buses, serves as both an event
center as well as a community
outreach and engagement facility.

CAMPUS LIFE
Help desks aid
troubles with
Wi-Fi network

With UM Wireless
gone, connecting to
MWireless remains
a challenge for many
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
While the University is offer-
ing walk-up assistance to help
students connect during the first
few weeks of classes, frustration
caused by dropped MWireless
connections may be an issue of
the past.
As students and faculty tran-
sition from the now defunct UM
Wireless Network to the new
campus network MWireless,
the University has created "help
desks" to provide support for
those experiencing difficulties.
The desks are organized and
hosted by the College of Engi-
neering,the Computer Showcase,
Information and Technology
Services, ITS Campus Comput-
ing Sites, the Shapiro Under-
graduate Library and University
Housing.
A combination of IT staff
and students who work at the
Computer Showcase and other
Campus Computing Sites will be
working through January 19 to
address connectivity issues.
The desks are located in Angell
Hall, the Undergraduate Library
and Pierpont Commons. These
organizations have provided a
full list of hours, so students can

get help at the place and time
most convenient for them. Palms
said in the future, help desks will
likely be set up at the start of the
fall and winter semesters.
MWireless was implemented
in 2009 and is the preferred
Wi-Fi network at the Univer-
sity. Information and Technol-
ogy Services made MWireless
the University's premiere Wi-Fi
network over the summer to con-
tinue the process of phasing UM
Wireless Network out.
As a result, incoming students
with new deviceswere not be able
to access UM Wireless Network,
forcing more and more people to
start connecting to MWireless.
However, problems connect-
ing to the new network can arise
when a Kerberos password, such
as the kind used to access Uni-
versity sites like CTools, is not
synchronized with other types of
account passwords.
Though this issue can be over-
come by logging onto weblogin.
umich.edu andselecting"Change
Your UMICH Password," not all
complications are as simple to
troubleshoot.
Andy Palms, ITS executive
director of communications sys-
tems and datacenters, canupdate
a new device in about 60 seconds,
but said the average person will
spend about five minutes trying
to connect even if all goes well.
"There's a lot of benefit to it,
but the initial configuration is not
what people normallyexpect," he
said.

launch
late-night
bus route
Proppe pushes to
make 'Night Owl'
route permanent
By WILL GREENBERG
DailyNews Editor
The "Night Owl" bus route,
a new service provided by Cen-
tral Student Government and
the Interfraternity Council,
launched it's new late-night
route Thursday.
The new bus route will pro-
vide Blue Bus services later
than any current routes to help
students get home to the more
remote parts of campus on the
weekends.
Funding for the new route
was approved earlier this month,
costing the CSG and IFC a col-
lective $30,000. The two orga-
nizations will each contribute
$15,000, and the CSG Assembly
will contribute an additional
$10,000 for advertising and inci-
dental causes. The money will
fund the route until the end of
the Winter 2014 semester.
CSG President Michael
Proppe said the new route, pro-
vided there is sufficient ridership
this weekend, will run Thursday
through Saturday evenings.
The Night Owl route will use
two Blue Buses, making stops at
off-campus locations as well as

Texting connected to
certain health benefits

Christie apologizes for
staff's 'stupid' behavior

Researchers discover
weight, other issues
aided by text alerts
By KAITLIN ZURDOSKY
Daily StaffReporter
The text message has changed
the face of social interactions and
business operations around the
globe. Today, approximately 2.4
billion cellular device consum-
ers use texting, demonstrating its
massive capacity for outreach.
Now researchers are discover-
ing the potential health benefits
this phenomenon may produce.
In a new trial study, Lorraine
R. Buis, an assistant professor
in the Department of Family
Medicine, found text messaging
programs can be successful in
helping people track their weight
and manage health problems.
"I have great interest in under-

While it was not surprising
that the people who took the time

"I can tell you that people used
it, and I can tell you that people
said that they changed their

of these types of programs," Buis
said.
With the stronger evidence
provided by the trial, Buis said
she is confident these types of
programs will be used frequently
in the future to improve health as
communication technology con-
tinues to influence patient care.

N.J. Gov. denies
involvement in
traffic scandal
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -
Republican Gov. Chris Chris-
tie fired one of his top aides
on Thursday and apologized
repeatedly for his staff's "stupid"
behavior, insisting during a near-
ly two-hour news conference that
he had no idea anyone around
him had engineered traffic jams
as part of a political vendetta
against a Democratic mayor.
"I am embarrassed and humil-
iated by the conduct of some of
the people on my team," Christie
said as he addressed the widen-
ing scandal, which could cast a
shadow over his expected run for
the White House in 2016.
The famously blunt governor
fielded dozens of questions from
reporters with uncharacteristic
patience and at times a sorrow-
ful tone.
Christie, who had previously
assured the public that his staff
had nothing to do with the Sep-
tember lane closings that caused
major backups at the George
Washington Bridge, said he fired
Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget
Anne Kelly "because she lied to
me" when he demanded weeks
ago that anyone who knew any-
thing about the episode come
forward.
The gridlock in Fort Lee
delayed emergency vehicles,
school buses and countless com-
muters for four days.
Kelly was the latest casualty in
the scandal. Two other top Chris-
tie appointees have resigned in
the past few weeks.
The investigation broke wide
open on Wednesday, with the
release of emails and text messag-
es that suggested Kelly arranged
the traffic jams to punish Fort
Lee's mayor for not endorsing
Christie for re-election.
In other developments:
- The chief federal prosecutor
in New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Paul

Fishman, said he is "reviewing
the matter to determine whether
a federal law was implicated."
The Legislature also is investi-
gating. Using public resources
for political ends can be a crime.
Democratic Connecticut Gov.
Dannel P. Malloy, a former pros-
ecutor and mayor, said there was
"no doubt" a crime was commit-
ted.
- David Wildstein, a Christie
appointee who resigned from the
Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey after being impli-
cated in the scandal, was found
in contempt by a legislative com-
mittee on Thursday after he
invoked his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination
and refused to answer questions.
The Port Authority operates the
-bridge and other area bridges
and transit hubs.
- Christie traveled to Fort
Lee later in the day and apolo-
gized in person to Mayor Mark
Sokolich. Christie said they had
a "productive meeting," and
Sokolich told The Record news-
paper the governor had taken "a
big step" toward regaining the
trust of Fort Lee's residents.
- Six state residents, though,
filed a federal lawsuit against
Christie, the state, the Port
Authority and others, call-
ing the traffic jams "deliberate
actions."
The political-payback allega-
tions turned a local traffic furor
into a national issue and raised
questions about Christie's lead-
ership and integrity as he lays
the groundwork for a White
House bid. Democrats at the
national level have seized on the
scandal as more evidence that
Christie is a bully.
The governor brushed off
questions about the effect on his
presidential prospects, saying he
was too busy governing the state
to think about that.
"I am absolutely nowhere
near beginning that consider-
ation process," he said."Ihaven't
even been sworn in for my sec-
ond term yet"

Afterward, some political
analysts on both sides of the
aisle said Christie would prob-
ably pull through OK - provided
there are no more surprises.
Democratic operative David
Axelrod complimented Chris-
tie for handling the news con-
ference "as well as he could,"
writing on Twitter: "Unless
smoking gun turns up tying him
to scheme, or others arise, he
lives 2 fight another day."
Besides firing Kelly, Chris-
tie cut ties to former campaign
manager Bill Stepien, askinghim
to withdraw a bid to become the
next state GOP chairman. The
governor said he was disturbed
by the "callous indifference" dis-
played by Stepien in the emails
released Wednesday.
Stepien had widely been seen
as a potential campaign manager
for Christie if he runs for presi-
dent.
Christie said he is still looking
into the traffic jam episode and
will take action against other
senior staff members if it is war-
ranted.
Over and over, Christie took
responsibility for the affair by
virtue of his role as governor
while simultaneously blaming
his staff for doing something
"stupid" and for not telling him
the truth when he asked.
He said he saw the emails and
text messages for the first time
on Wednesday and was "blind-
sided" by what he read and out-
raged by the callous language.
He said he was left "heartbro-
ken" and "betrayed" by his
tight-knit circle of advisers.
"I had no knowledge or
involvement in this issue, in its
planning or execution," Chris-
tie said of the lane closings.
"And I am stunned by the abject
stupidity that was shown here."
Kelly hasn't commented.
Christie said he hadn't spoken
to her or asked to hear her side
of the story since the emails
were released, saying he didn't
want to be accused of trying to
influence a possible witness.

of fears that civilian casualties
could incite Sunni anger and
push moderate tribal leaders
to side with the extremists,
analysts and military officials
said Thursday.
More violence flared in Bagh-
dad, where a suicide bomber
killed 21 people at an army
recruiting center in a clear effort
to demoralize the military.
Al-Qaida-linked fighters
overran parts of the cities of
Fallujah and Ramadi in Sunni-
dominated Anbar province last
week, seizing control of police
stations and military posts,
freeing prisoners and setting up
their own checkpoints.
The United States, whose
troops fought bloody battles in
the cities, has ruled out send-
ing its troops back in, but has
been delivering missiles to bol-
ster Iraqi forces. It is expediting
shipments of more American-
made missiles and 10 surveil-
lance drones, but those may not
arrive for weeks.

WALGREENS

Watkins said he appreciates the
cleanliness of the new store,
the Michigan-themed interior
and Walgreen's new offerings
in comparison to the CVS fur-
ther down the street. Watkins
said his choice between the
two stores will ultimately come
down to which is more budget-
friendly.
"It depends on whatcthey have
and what's cheaper," Watkins
said. "I noticed they have dif-
ferent things than CVS like
they have a make-your-own six-
pack beer and I'm a senior so I
can appreciate that."
LSA freshman Dolapo Adeniji
voiced her enthusiasm about the

Walgreens opening. She said her
first impression of the store as
clean, attractive and cost-friend-
ly. When asked if she would
choose Walgreens over CVS, she
had no hesitation in her answer.
"Oh hell yeah," Adeniji said.
"It's even closer than CVS."
On the other hand, not every-
one was as ecstatic to walk
through the new pharmacy, as
some students are staying loyal
to CVS.
LSA senior Kelsie Holden said
CVS is closer to her home and is
more convenient. She added that
her membership is another rea-
son for staying faithful.
"I'll still just come to CVS,"
Holden said. "I have their
rewards program and all that
stuff al-eady set up and ready to
go."

"Saving Mr. Banks" and
"American Hustle" are play-
ing at the Michigan Theater
and State Theater. Both were
featured in the Daily's Best
of 2013: Top 10 Films. See for
yourself if the films are worth
the Oscar buzz.
"'Hustle' could have been
a cheap cop drama, a 1970s
sleaze-fest or a serious quasi-
documentary," wrote Daily
Arts Editor Natalie Gadbois.
"Through transcendent perfor-
mances from all the leads and
(director David O.) Russell's
brilliantly wacky script, it's
instead a forceful and uproari-
ous story that defies genre."
The Dicks and Janes, a co-ed
a cappella club, will hold its

winter auditions from 5 p.m. to
11 p.m. in Burton Tower.
Friday also marks the return
of Freshman Fridays at the
Career Center, where first-year
students can enjoy food, Xbox
and each other's company from

site through allows students to
cancel or change their reserva-
tion prior to boarding the buses.
New boarding assistants,
located either on the bus or at
the center, will be a contact for
students who have questions
about bus scheduling. Their job
is to provide a voice for the stu-
dents and make the bus more
efficient for riders.
"They act asa liaison between
administration and staff that

works (at the center) and the
people directly on the bus," Mor-
land said.
As the MDCC becomes more
popular, Morland said he hopes
the University will eventually
run buses seven days a week.
These new times would grant
more students the opportunity
to visit the center and more
classes will be able to be offered
there.
"We are looking to expand it
in the future and hopefully to
reach not just from Ann Arbor to
Detroit but possibly some of the
other U of M campuses as well."


WI-Fl
From Page 1
Palms said a difficult setup
for an IT employee might take 15
minutes - and it may take even
longer for someone not familiar
with the system.
While the setup process might
be challenging, Palms said there
are many benefits of MWireless
that are not available when using
UM Wireless Network. Devices
that have been set up to access
MWireless connect automatical-
ly - no sign-in required. In addi-
tion, the network is encrypted so
that messages and information
sent by users cannot be seen by
outsiders trying to access it. _
Heather Kipp, ITS marketing
communications specialist, said
because many students receive
new electronic devices like com-
puters, tablets and smartphones
as presents over the holidays, the
help desks can help ensure all
these new devices have access

to MWireless when students
return to campus.
"Walk-up desks give students
an opportunity to configure
them with a staff person man-
ning the desk to make sure they
connect to MWireless properly,"
Kipp said.
However, Palm said new
measures cannot solve all Wi-
Fi-related problems. Especially
in residence halls, people with
their own Wi-Fi networks, such
as those in some printers, can
have trouble connecting because
the networks interfere with each
other.
"We want to make sure peo-
ple know help is available, but
we can't guarantee that we can
solve all problems because there
are other devices that inherently
conflict with our network," Palm
said. "For people to have a good
experience with Wi-Fi, what
we need to do is just provide a
fair amount of access to help
desk services. That's what we're
working to ramp up."

Rodman apologizes for remarks
about detained U.S. missionary

Erratic former NBA
player has visited
North Korea and
Kim JongUn
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - Dennis Rodman apolo-
gized Thursday for comments
he made in North Korea about a
detained American missionary,
saying he had been drinking and
was under pressure as he orga-
nized a game with former NBA
players.
The former basketball star
issued the apology through publi-
cist Jules Feiler in an email mes-
sage to The Associated Press, a
day after he sang "Happy Birth-
day" to North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un at the start of the friendly
game.
Rodman has been slammed
for not using his influence with
Kim to help free Kenneth Bae, the
missionary in poor health who is
being confined in North Korea for
"anti-state" crimes. In an inter-

view with CNN on Tuesday, Rod-
man implied Bae was at fault.
"I want to apologize," Rodman
said Thursday. "I take full respon-
sibility for my actions. It had been
a very stressful day. Some of my
teammates were leaving because
of pressure from their families and
business associates. My dreams of
basketball diplomacy was quickly
falling apart. I had been drinking.
It's not an excuse but by the time
the interview happened I was
upset. I was overwhelmed. It's not
an excuse, it's just the truth."
Rodman said he wanted to
apologize first to Bae'sfamily. "I'm
very sorry. At this point I should
know better than to make politi-
cal statements. I'm truly sorry."
In the interview, Rodman was
asked whether he would raise the
issue of Bae during his visit.
"Kenneth Bae did one thing,"
Rodman replied. "If you under-
stand what Kenneth Bae did - do
you understand what he did in
this country?"
Asked to explain, Rodman
declined to respond.
Bae, a Korean-American Chris-

tian missionary and tour operator
based in China, has been detained
for more than a year. North Korea
sees missionary work as a threat
to its authoritarian government.
Bae's sister, Terri Chung, wel-
comed Rodman's apology.
"I think it's good to see him
recognize the gravity and the
urgency of Ken's plight," she
said from her home in Edmonds,
Washington. "It's nothing he can
make light of or play games with."
"I just want to make sure that
everyone - not just Dennis Rod-
man - everyone knows about
Kenneth Bae'splight and how pre-
carious it is," she said.
The U.S. State Department dis-
tanced itself from Rodman and
said it did not want to "dignify"his
activities or comments in Pyong-
yang by commenting on them. But
spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the
department was open to speaking
with Rodman on his return.
"We have not reached out to
him. We've said before, if he wants
to reach out to us, we're happy to
hear from him and what he has to
say," she told reporters.


VIOLENCE

reported violence.
In the study, men were more
often associated with non-dat-
ing violence, while women were
linked more closely with dating
violence.
"Our findings indicate that
interventions that address
violence among youth should
address substance use and psy-
chological factors, as well as be
tailored by type of violence -
dating versus non-dating - and

by gender," Epstein-Ngo said.
Based on their research, the
study's authors emphasized a
need to help teens cope with
conflict and anger, as well as
understand the possibility of
escalation when combined with
drug use.
In an interview, Quyen said
there is plenty of opportunity to
expand upon the research.
"In the future, we hope to
look more at how digital dating
violence occurs, and how social
media and things like cellphones
and texting are playing roles in
dating aggression as well."

Street area, running from10 p.m.
to 3 a.m. every 20 minutes. There
will also be transfers for North
Campus at the Central Campus
Transit Center.
Currently, only the North
Campus weekend line runs later
than 12:30 a.m., with Oxford ser-
vices ending at 10 p.m. on week-
ends.
The new route is in response
to the recent upswing in crime
in the evenings. From June 2010
to April 2013, 67 percent of inci-
dents were off-campus and 64
percent occurred while the vic-
tim was walking.
"I'm excited the buses are up
and running," Proppe said. "I'm
not sure what usage will look
like on the first night before
we've done our marketing but I
think a lot of students will take
advantage of the service in the
next few weeks."

Dean of Students Laura Blake
Jones and Eddie Washington,
Jr., the executive director of the
Division of Public Safety and
Security, contributed external
support for the project.
The route will continue to be
funded by CSG and the IFC for
now, but Proppe hopes the route
will eventually join the rest of
the Blue Bus service and receive
University funding.
The Night Owl route is not
currently registered with the
Magic Bus app for students to
track the bus as it makes stops
- a feature Proppe hopes to
change in the coming weeks.
"Parking and transportation

Failing 'Pure Michigan'
Gov. Snyder must block the shipment of tar sands across the Great Lakes
In a letter on January 3, Cynthia Quarterman, head of the
federal government's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration, urged Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) to support
the Line 5 pipeline across the Great Lakes. The proposed Line 5 pipeline
would transport tar sands through the Straits of Mackinac to refineries,
most of which are in surrounding states. However, doing so poses extreme
environmental danger to the Great Lakes and surrounding areas. Gov.
Rick Snyder (R-Mich.) should not allow tar sands to be transported across
the Great Lakes and should oppose the Line 5 pipeline.

Joking without offending

dian Bo Burnham released
his newest special, "what."

YouTube and
iTunes. Hav-

Burnham for a

him live in Royal
Oak in 2010, back
when he was DEREK
a budding star
known for the WOLFE
comedic songs
he released on
YouTube - I was excited to spend
an hour watching it.
However, early into the viewing
Burnham joked: "Yo fellas, don't
you hate when you're blowing a guy
and he ends up being a faggot? Am
I right?"
Let me start by saying that I
think Bo Burnham is brilliant and
the rest of the special was hilari-
ous. The songs he writes prove
that he has a distinct understand-
ing of society that most people
his age don't. Just listen to "Art Is
Dead" or "From God's Perspective."
But this "joke" instantly made me
uncomfortable. It was supposed to
be funny, I guess. Yet it also struck
a chord with me. Why make this
joke, using that word? It is offen-
sive, wrong and, frankly, outdated.
It's also worth mentioning that the
rest of the show was sprinkled with
"fag" comments.
Now, I know that comedians
often intentionally cross the line
to make jokes - saying "faggot" is
commonplace for many comedi-
ans - and Burnham is known for
being a satirical writer. His mate-

Quarterman's letter stated that Enbridge
Energy Partners, the operator of the pipeline
in question, has made considerable improve-
ments in safety standards. Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sta-
benow initially requested information about
the pipeline's safety, expressing concern for
the transportation of light crude oil under
the lakes.
"We cannot afford to have a spill that could
damage the Great Lakes and Michigan's tour-
ism economy," Stabenow said.
Despite Quarterman's assurances, Enbridge
has a history of failed pipelines, calling the
company's credibility into question. In 2010,
the company's pipeline in the Kalamazoo River
burst, causing one of the largest on-land oil
spills inhistory. The Environmental Protection
Agency estimated more than a million gallons
of oil were released in the spill, costing $765
million in cleanup expenses. The company's
unsuccessful history demonstrates insufficient
attention to safety, making the federal govern-
ment's assurances untrustworthy.
Past failures of Enbridge's pipelines reveal
that the risks tar sand pipelines pose out-
weigh potential economic benefits. Crude oil
in tar sands ismuch more volatile than other
types of crude oil, making it extremely diffi-
cult to extract from sand, clay and bitumen.
The process involves burning natural gas to
generate steam for melting, and uses two to

five barrels of water for every barrel of oil
refined. The energy necessary to extract, sep-
arate and process oil from tar sands results in
total greenhouse gas emissions three times
that of conventionally produced oil. The
entire process is extremely inefficient and
ecologically damaging.
Furthermore, Snyder also faces intense
scrutiny for his environmental record, and
approval of the Enbridge pipeline would only
worsen his rating. Michigan's Sierra Club gave
Snyder a failing grade for his environmental
policy. According to Mike Berkowitz, legisla-
tive and political director of the club, "Nearly
80 percent of decisions made by Gov. Snyder in
our scorecard contribute toward polluting our
water, air, land and undermining public health
and good government." By rejecting Enbridge
Energy's Mackinac pipeline, Snyder would be
working to strengthen protection of Michi-
gan's natural resources, potentially reversing
a troubling trend of policies that sacrifice the
environment for economic benefit.
Though Snyder has not made the protec-
tion of natural resources a top priority while
in office, it is vital that he protect the Great
Lakes from the potential spills caused by the
pipeline. Snyder must oppose the transporta-
tion of tar sands oil across the Great Lakes in
order to prevent Enbridge Energy from creat-
ing yet another environmental and financial
disaster - one that Michigan can ill afford.

VISHNU VENUGOPAL I
What comes next?

A fundamental component of the battle
against the inequalities we see on campus,
big or small, is awareness. Awareness of
our environment. Awareness of the way we
think. Awareness of the people around us
and the steps we can take to ensure a healthy
and supportive community. And yet, vague
words like "awareness," "community" and
"social justice" can trick people into think-
ing these issues have nothing to do with
them. What does awareness really entail?
One could argue it is as simple as acknowl-
edging the existence of another human being
or social identity. Fortunately, conversations
that have been happening on campus have
proven this to be completely false. You can
see it all around campus: From classrooms to
dorm rooms to bus stops, people have been
talking about things like Theta Xi, #BBUM
and #UMMockEviction. The reality is that
these issues affect everyone, regardless of
your background.
These issues are microcosms of larger,
global issues: Theta Xi's appropriation of
black culture is an example of the appropria-
tion of minority group's cultures, #BBUM,
tackled the lack of cultural sensitivity and
inclusivity on an institutional level, and
#UMMockEviction drew attention to Pal-
estinians being forcibly removed from their
homes, raising awareness about the Arab-
Israeli conflict. Although knowledge of these
events and conversations can be thought-pro-
voking and raise questions, simply knowing is
not enough. In my eyes, the next step is enter-
ing into a conversation to hear other peoples
perspectives, and luckily for me, I found a
platform to do that through SAAN, the South
Asian Awareness Network.
I began working with SAAN during the
first semester of my junior year as a small
group facilitator for the annual conference
in January. A good friend of mine was one
of the committee chairs and encouraged me
to apply. After going through the applica-
tion and interview process, I was fortunate
enough to be offered one of the 30 facilita-
tor positions. From there, things began to

change. At the start I felt out of place, hold-
ing varying degrees of understanding on the
concepts that we were discussing. It made me
uncomfortable to see my lack of awareness,
but slowly, I began to engage my discomfort
and see how it could be a learning experience.
And I began to grow.
Finding a comfort zone on this campus can
be tricky, and finding a space where you're
just uncomfortable enough to know you're
growing can be even harder. The SAAN Con-
ference works to provide both the former and
the latter. Entering into a space with a large
group of people who may be strangers and
who are from radically different backgrounds
can be intimidating. But over the course of
two days, people are able to navigate their
ways to growth and deeper understanding.
What I most enjoy about the SAAN Confer-
ence is exactly this: being able to learn and
grow as an individual with completely new
people, all while engaging in dialogue about
relevant social justice topics. Although con-
versations about such issues shouldn't end
with dialogue - in fact, to me, dialogue rep-
resents just one phase of a cyclical process -
having these conversations about identities
and issues can lead to compassion and even
to action for a greater cause. I invite you all to
join usas we start on this path toward a more
supportive, empathetic and involved campus.
Through the SAAN Conference, we hope to
engage our participants in a way that chal-
lenges their thinking, as well as expose them
to new ideas and bring them to new levels of
awareness and understanding with regard to
themselves and the world around them. What
happens then? Our hope is that participants
can then take this new knowledge and under-
standing into their daily lives and, if they
so choose, actively engage in conversation,
action and change.
This year's conference, titled "Panorama:
Capturing Change Through the Lens of Cul-
ture," will be held January 17th and 18th. Reg-
ister now and learn more at umsaan.umich.edu.

n Dec. 16, while most stu-
dents were on their 12th
cup of coffee amid study-
ing for a stats
final - and the
lucky few were
already in their
"Finals are done
so I'm not leav-
ing the couch"
phase - a major
decision came
out of the Feder- PATRICK
al District Court MAILLET
for the District
of Columbia.
Federal Judge Richard Leon ruled
that the National Security Agency's
bulk collection of phone records
and other personal information is -
most likely - unconstitutional. This
ruling marks the first major court
decision against the NSA's contro-
versial data mining collection pro-
gram that has come to light since
the leaks by former NSA contractor
Edward Snowden last summer. With
any luck, the ruling by Judge Leon
will be the first of many to come.
For those unfamiliar with the
agency's history, after the passage
of the 2001 Patriot Act, the NSA was
given the authority to collect data
"that may be relevant to a terrorist or

Over-the-top
'American Hustle'
set for Oscar success

Senior Arts Editor

showiness of "American Hustle."

by David O. Russell, the master-
mind behind 2012's acclaimed
"Silver Linings Playbook," "Hus-
tle" defies genre by simultane-
ously being heavy and hilarious,
outrageous and emotionallypres-
ent, kitschy and thought-provok,
ing. The film risks ridiculousness,
but grounds itself in nuanced and
powerful performances from the
entire cast.
Cinema has a classic love of
corrupt couples: the Bonnie and
Clydes, the Scarletts and Rhetts.
Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney
Prosser (Christian Bale, "Out of
the Furnace" and Amy Adams,
"Her") have now entered that
hallowed hall of dangerous lov-
ers. Irving is a small time but
successful conman who falls in
love with Sydney, a forceful yet
reserved rationalist played to
perfection by Adams. Sydney
assumes the persona of Edith

Greensley, an aristocratic Eng-
lishwoman with contacts in Brit-
ish banks, in order to deceive
small-business owners into buy-
ing loans that will never be paid
off. Though perhaps the least
flashy in a blindingly bright
cast, Adams deftly portrays
Sydney's deep insecurities and
all-consuming ambition with
quiet grace. The jig seems to be
up when Irving and Sydney are
caught by second-rate FBI Agent
Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper,
"The Hangover Part III") until
he offers a get-out-of-jail free
card Irving can't resist: if they
help him catch four other con
artists, they won't be sent away.
In a world divided between
good and bad, the irony is that
the conmen perhaps have more
of a conscience than the sup-
posed innocents that surround
them; DiMaso looks for crime
with such zest that he is willing
to frame an innocent man. Rosa-
lyn, Irving's bi-polar stay-at-
home wife (Jennifer Lawrence,
"The Hunger Games: Catching
Fire"), is egoistic and negligent,
lighting the kitchen on fire twice
and forgetting to pick her son up
because she has a date. Richie
and Rosalyn blow through life,
ignoring the wreckage behind
them, while Irving and Sydney
carefully weigh each decision,
especially the ones that affect
others, even though these deci-
sions are often dishonest.
Because of this dichotomy, in a
film stuffed with award-winning
actors, it's Bale and Adams who
supply the emotional weight.
The contrast between them and
their overblown counterparts is
ripe with humor, which is both
superficial (Bradley Cooper in
'70s style hair curlers is a sight to
behold), and an important part of

the caricatures they feed into.
As the story continues and
the scam snowballs uncontrol-
laby, growing to implicate a faux
sheikh, a coterie of Congressmen
and a casino kingpin, the film
becomes murky and at times dis-
tractingly complex. This confu-
sion is not an effect of a flurried
plot, but instead Russell's honor-
able attempt at adeptly portray-
ing the thoughts and motivations
of all the different characters,
people who often don't know
what they really want.
Without a doubt, "Hustle" is
an excellent film - worthy of the
Oscar buzz surrounding it. It has
a talented cast and an interesting
plot; it's a period piece and is also
visually transformative (Bale
is nearly unrecognizable with
his slimy hairpiece and extra 50
pounds). But unlike many awards
contenders, "Hustle" is plain fun.
It's a zany, over-the-top portrayal
of a fascinating time and place in
the United States, and it really
is enjoyable to watch. The music
is upbeat and period relevant,
the script sharp and ironic, the
clothing glamorous; it doesn't get
bogged down in details or scenes
meant to shock or scare. "Hustle"
is a joy to watch and a fantastic
piece of art - a film worth sitting
in a theater and buying a $10 pop-
corn for.
"Hustle" could have been a
cheap cop drama, a 1970s sleaze-
fest or a serious quasi-documen-
tary - but through transcendent
performances from the leads
and Russell's brilliantly wacky
script, is instead a forceful and
uproarious story that defies
genre. At its heart, this is a love
story and a tale of the passion
(not just between people) that
makes us act in inexplicable
ways.

Weekend of ranked
opponents awaits

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's swim-
ming and divingteam is tired.
Some high intensity training in
Florida, considered by Michigan
coach Mike Bottom to be their
best week of practice, followed by
travel back to Ann Arbor through
the polar vortex has proven ardu-
ous forthe Wolverines.
In a close race to remain one
of the top 25 teams in the College
Swimming Coaches Association
of America, No. 24 Michigan will
need to stay motivated as the Wol-
verines (1-2 Big Ten, 3-2 overall)
take their skills to Indianapolis
and Chicago in their next meets
of the new year.
"There was no limitation to the
amount of work we did (in Flori-
da)," Bottom said. "They're going
to be tired, so we'll see how they
perform."
On Friday, Michigan will com-
pete in a dual meet against No.
20 Purdue before heading to the
Windy City the next day to face
No. 25 Notre Dame, Northwest-
ern and Rutgers in a quad meet.
This weekend will be the Wol-
verines' first conference matchup
since October, and Michigan's
first time racing in back-to-back
meets this season.
Despite the busy schedule
ahead, sophomore Ali DeLoof
likely speaks for the rest of the
team when she acknowledges her
own enthusiasm for the meets.
"We are going to treat it like
it were a Big Ten Champion-
ship meet and remain positive,"
DeLoof said. "It's goingto be very
exciting."
With her 44-point contribu-
tion to the Wolverines' Orange
Bowl Swim Classic win last week,
DeLoof set numerous records,

including the 200-meter med-
ley relay (1:54.31), 200-meter
freestyle relay (1:46.65) and the
50-meter freestyle (26.60). For
the third time this season, she
earned Big Ten Swimmer of the
Week on Tuesday.
The Boilermakers (2-0,5-0) are
ahead of Michigan in the rank-
ings, so Fridaynight's contest will
be a tight battle to climb the bi-
monthly poll. In the two power-
houses' third matchup in 16 years
- the Wolverines holding an 8-1
all-time edge - things will be
tougher than they look on paper.
Purdue senior Carly Mercer
for example, a two-time Big Ten
Swimmer of the Week, holds the
country's fastest time in the 100-
yard freestyle this season (48.43).
Bottom is adamant that his divers
will need to step up, especially
against Purdue's two-time All-
American senior Casey Matthews
- the reigning NCAA Champion
in the three-meter dive.
But Michigan might be more
focused on the Fighting Irish
after they cruised through the
Wolverines in last year's match,
185-115. Junior EmmaReaney, the
country's top breaststroker with a
personal best of 58.84 in the 100-
meter breastroke, will help the
Irish (4-3) make a strong finish.
Bottom hopes to counter her with
Michigan senior Angela Chokran.
"Chokran mightcnot be the fast-
est but she is damn tough," Bot-
tom said.
Add the Wildcats (5-3, 1-3) and
the Scarlet Knights (3-1) into the
mix, and the Wolverines are going
to have a busy Saturday afternoon.
Bottom says that "turns, starts,
finishes, race strategy and lane
placement" must be tuned up
if Michigan wishes to earn two
wins this weekend, and Bottom
hopes they come to fruition.

Behind Ristovski, first-half

surge, Wolverines get past

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
There was a pendulum-like
flow to the opening nine min-
utes of the Michigan women's
basketball team's Big Ten home
opener
against WISCONSIN 62
Wisconsin. MICHIGAN 70
One
team attacked and the other
responded, and neither took
more than a three-point lead
until midway through the back-
and-forth first half.
Then, the pendulum broke.
Sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski sparked the Wolver-
ines, leading a 19-5 run to give
Michigan a lead that it never
relinquished. The Wolverines
survived a late Wisconsin rally
to hold on for a 70-62 victory.
After starting the run with
a dish inside to junior forward
Cyesha Goree, Ristovski con-
tinued her personal streak,
contributing to Michigan's next
seven points. Following a Wis-
consin free throw that tied the

game at 16, she gave the Wolver-
ines the lead for good by hitting
a 3-pointer, the team's first of
the night.
Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 11-4
overall) didn't score its next
basket for two minutes, but by
then it could afford the brief
lapse. The Wolverines created
two turnovers and held the Bad-
gers (1-1, 8-6) scoreless for three
minutes, leading to a 7-0 run.
From then on, the pendulum
rarely swung back in Wiscon-
sin's favor.
"They're going to get punch-
es, we're going to get punches,"
Goree said. "It's all about who
can take the hit and hit the next
punch harder. We kept fighting
and we got our lead, and we kept
building up our lead."
Ristovski continued to use
her hot hand when the Wolver-
ines' scoring resumed, finding
junior guard Nicole Elmblad for
a layup. Then, on Michigan's
next possession, the sophomore
scored another of her own after
an Elmblad offensive rebound.
The Wolverines led 23-16 and


didn't slow down.
Before Wisconsin forward
Jackie Gulczynski made a
3-pointer with 38 seconds left
in the first half, Michigan held
a 33-20 advantage. By the time
the run was complete, Michi-
gan had forced seven turnovers
in 10 minutes and had given the
ball away just three times in the
entire first half.
Michigan displayed even
more offensive firepower near
the end of the first half. Fresh-
man guard Siera Thompson
drained a deep 3-pointer to
extend the Wolverines's lead to
26-18. Ristovski made the team's
second consecutive 3-pointer by
hitting one in transition with
3:19 left in the half, finishing
her seven-minute spurt of eight
points and two assists.
"When she's on the court,
we're usually doing pretty
well," said Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico.
The Wolverines closed out
the half with a 35-23 lead, the
product of the 19-5 run and
the 11 turnovers they forced on


Badgers
defense. They hung on in the
second half to improve to 11-0
this season when leading at the
break.
The Wolverines continued
a balanced scoring effort to
extend their lead to 25 on two
separate occasions in the sec-
ond half. Four players scored in
double figures for Michigan, led
by Goree with 15.
"We have such a balanced
attack," Barnes Arico said. "On
any given night, we can have
five or six or sometimes even
seven kids be our leading scorer.
I think that puts a lot of pressure
on other team's defenses."
It looked as if Michigan
would cruise to victory, but the
game abruptly, swung back in
the Badgers' favor once the Wol-
verines took a 60-35lead.
Wisconsin strung together a
late 23-4 run, cutting the lead
to single digits for the first time
since the first half. But Michi-
gan halted the near-comeback
with solid free-throw shooting
in the final minutes to escape at
home.

at the end might not have been
possible if not for an even more

period from Michigan with a

"We were a little bit down
because they had just came
back and hit a couple of threes,"
Robinson said. "After Derrick

thought we had great energy
going into halftime."
Though Michigan shot 57
percent in the half, pace of play
was slow and a slew of 3-point-
ers by Husker guard Ray Gal-
legos helped to keep the score
close. Gallegos, a thorn in the
Wolverines' side the last two
years, added another triple in
the second half to tie the game
with 4:38 left to play.
Nebraska had plenty to play
for in the first Big Ten game
at the newly opened Pinnacle

over the Wolverines would have
done wonders for the program.
