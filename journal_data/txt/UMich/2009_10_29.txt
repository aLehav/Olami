Officials: New
method designed to
be more holistic
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
In a reversal from current prac-
tices, University officials have
announced that when students
apply to the University, they will
no longer have their grade point
averages recalculated.
University officials say this new
approach will provide for a more
holistic review of applications.
In an interview yesterday, Pro-
vost Teresa Sullivan laughed and
admitted that she didn't really even
know why GPAs were being recal-
culated in the first place.
Sullivan said she thought GPAs
were previously recalculated to
put students on a "more parallel
standing" since some schools don't
calculate GPA in the same way, but
admissions officers already look at
individual grades instead of just
the cumulative GPA.
"The recalculated GPA was
really something that was used in
the early admissions system and
it doesn't seem to make as much
sense now," Sullivan said.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director of
undergraduate admissions, said in

an interview yesterday that the old
method involved admissions offi-
cers reviewing transcripts, noting
trends in student progress and the
grades earned in their courses -
somethingthatremains unchanged
under the new plan.
However, the process also
included a GPA recalculation that
removed certain classes - includ-
ing most fine arts courses - alto-
gether from an applicant's GPA in
order to review applications on a
more even playing field.
Spencer said that by taking out
GPA recalculation, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions will be
able to focus on other admissions
processes.
"We wanted to spend more time
actually reviewing the files and
recruiting," Spencer said. "We
thought this was a method to both
allow us to put most of our efforts
in the places where we could do the
best, because we are already in our
present review looking for those
very same things that the recalcu-
lation was looking for as well."
Admissions officers already note
certain courses for applicants who
may have taken a more challeng-
ing curriculum, Sullivan said. She
added that since applicants are
never compared to one another,
it doesn't matter how much one
school weighs an Advanced Place-
ment course, or an equivalent, in

Students demand
answers on racial
* issues at the 'U'
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The fire wasn't the only thing
heated at the University Presi-
dent's monthly fireside chat yes-
terday.

At the first fireside chat of
the year, University President
Mary Sue Coleman spent an hour
addressing questions raised by a
group of about 30 students. Stu-
dent attendance at the chats is by
invitation only.
Students sat around a fireplace
at the William Monroe Trotter
Multicultural Center and brought
up a range of concerns - includ-
ing the state's potential cut of the
Michigan Promise Scholarship,

cultural diversity, University
tuition hikes and transportation
problems between Central Cam-
pus and North Campus.
While fireside chats tend to
be somewhat light-hearted, at
this particular one, Coleman was
repeatedly questioned on diversity
and race issues at the University.
A report released by Uni-
versity officials two weeks ago
showed underrepresented minor-
ity enrollment for freshmen at the

University fell 11.4 percent from
last year - 69 fewer students than
last year's class. Overall freshman
enrollment, however, rose 5.1 per-
cent over last year.
Since the 2006 passage of a
statewide constitutional amend-
ment banning public institutions
from using affirmative action as a
factor in admissions, the number
of underrepresented minorities
enrolled at the University has fall-

House on Packard St.
will soon be the first
LEED-certified
student housing in A2
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Staff Reporter
Students looking to adopt an
eco-friendly lifestyle now have
more opportunities than ever to
live green.
A house on Packard Road is being
renovated to be the first LEED-
certified private student housing

in Ann Arbor. University Housing
is also implementing initiatives
to make residence halls - includ-
ing North Quad, which is slated to
open in fall 2010 - more energy
efficient.
Warren Samberg, owner of the
Packard house, said there were sev-
eral reasons why he decided to go
for LEED certification.
"One is to be environmentally
responsible, which is kind of a per-
sonal goal or philosophy," he said.
"The other is to be more financial.
Implementing green technology is
not only a sustainable choice, but
will reduce operating expenses
over time."

Samberg, a LEED-accredited
architect, said he's installing a geo-
thermal heating and cooling sys-
tem in the house and is laying the
foundation for 12 new rooms in the
next few weeks.
He said the renovation is still in
its early stages, but he hopes it will
be done by April 1, 2010 in time for
May leasing.
Sambergsaid he hopes thatthese
changes will make the house an
attractive rental option for envi-
ronmentally conscious students.
"People are looking for that type
of lifestyle where they can be as
responsible as they can to help the

Prompted by death of
Chicago teen, Black
Student Union
organized Diag vigil
By OLIVIA CARRINO
Daily StaffReporter
Approximately30studentswith
burning candles in hand gathered
on the Diag last night to commem-
orate the victims of urban-youth
brutality.
The vigil, organized by the
Black Student Union, was prompt-
ed by the death of Derrion Albert
- an African-American 16-year-
old who was beaten to death on
Chicago's South Side on Sept. 24,
just blocks from his high school.
Pour teenagers have been
arrested for the honor student's
murder, which garnered national
attention because of a bystander's
videotape that made its way onto
televisions and computer screens
across the country.
"I think the purpose of the
event was to give honor to a young
man who tragically lost his life in
a very violent act that had nothing
to do with him," Music, Theatre &
Dance junior Logan McClendon
said. "He was truly just a victim of
his environment."
LSA sophomore Constance-
Marie James, programming co-
chair of the Black Student Union,

that bring food right to students'

rently acts as a middleman between
22 local establishments on or near

campus.
The business was started last
year under the name MDelivers.
Business senior Evan Demchick is
the current CEO and works with
Business juniors Zach Albert and
Marshall Eisler.
Demchick said S2YD was start-

"We basically thought that there

said.
Orders can be placed online or

The case of the murdered cat

Fraternicies near campus
have a variety of reputa-
tions. Cat killers isn't one of
them.
That wasn't always the
case. On Dec. 6, 1980, five
members of the Alpha Delta
Phi fraternity captured
their house cat, cut off its
paws and set it on fire. This
incident led the took of the
fraternity, Earl Carl of Ann
Arbor, to resign six days
later, as reported in an issue
of The Michigan Daily from
Fehruary 10, 1ean.
O Friday February 8,
1980, Carl filed a lawsuit
against the fraternity in
Washtenaw County Circuit
Court accusing the frater-
nity, located at 556 S. State
St., of covering up the iden-
tities of the members who

killed the cat, according the
article.
Carl demanded at lean
$10,000 in financial com-
pensation to cover the
remainder of his contract
which would have expired it
May, and to offset emotions
distress he said he faced.
.The defendants in the
trial were Douglas Hamlir
the chapter president at the
time of the incident, Davic
Froikin, the former house
steward, and the fraternity',
alumni association hoardo
directors.
Carl told the Daily at the
time that there were "three
people directly putting pres.
sure on me to say nothing tc
the media or the police." He
went on to say that the three
people were Gene Hand, the

NEWS BRIEFS
BERLIN
German Chancellor
Merkel re-elected
Angela Merkel was sworn in yes-
terday for a second term as German
chancellor and her new center-right
government took up the task of tack-
ling the country's tough economic
situation a month after national
elections.
Merkel, 55, will serve as chancel-
lor of a ruling coalition made up of
her Christian Democratic Party, its
Bavaria-only sister party the Chris-
tian Social Union, and the pro-busi-
ness Free Democrats
She was elected through a vote
of 323 in favor out of a possible
612. But nine members of coalition
parties voted against her, lead-
ing some to question the govern-
ment's solidity hours after she and
her 15 ministers were sworn in.
PESHAWAR, Pakistan
Car bomb kills 100
Suspected militants exploded
a car bomb in a market crowded
with women and children yester-
day, killing 100 people and turning
shops selling wedding dresses, toys
and jewelry into a mass of burning
debris and bodies.
The attack in the northwestern
city of Peshawar was Pakistan's
deadliest since 2007 and came as
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton visited the country to
offer support for its fight against a
strengthening al-Qaida and Tali-
ban-led insurgency based along the
Afghan border.
Clinton was three hours' drive
away in the capital meeting Paki-
stani government leaders when the
bomb went off in Peshawar. Her trip
was not announced in advance in
Pakistan for security reasons.
The bomb was directed squarely
at civilians, unlike many previous
blasts that have targeted security
forces or government or Western
interests. While no one claimed
responsibility, the bomb appeared
aimed at undercutting public and
political support for an ongoing
army offensive against militants
close to the frontier and showing
that the government was unable to
keep its people safe.
CHICAGO
As H1N1 spreads,
-.
schools close
The number of students staying
home sick with the flu is multiply-
ing nationwide and normally quiet
school nurses' offices suddenly
look like big city emergency rooms,
packed with students too ill to finish
the day.
The federal government has
urged schools to close because of
the swine flu only as a last resort.
But schools are closing by the doz-
ens as officials say they are being
hit so hard and so fast by the H1N1
virus that they feel shutting down
for a few days is the only feasible
option.
"There was nothing else we could
do," said Michael Frechette, the
superintendent of Connecticut's
Middletown Public Schools where a
middle school closed for the rest of

the week after 120 students stayed
home sick Monday and another 25
were sent home by noon. "The only
way to stop that transmittal was to
keep the kids home for the rest of
the week."
At least 351 schools were closed
last week alone - affecting 126,000
students in 19 states, according to the
U.S. Education Department. So far
this school year, about 600 schools
have temporarily shut their doors.

State Senate debates
stem cell research
Embryonicstemcellresearchsup-
porters are worried that legislation
debated in a state Senate committee
Wednesday could threaten the prog-
ress of research in Michigan.
The bills discussed in the Senate
Health Policy Committee would
establish reporting requirements
and penalties for violations related
to Proposal 2, which Michigan vot-
ers approved in 2008. The mea-
sure loosened state restrictions on
embryonic stem cell research by
allowing people to donate embryos
left over from fertility treatments.
Supporters of the new bills say
lawmakers have a responsibility
to define and clarify the constitu-
tional amendment within state law.
But stem cell research supporters
said the proposals go too far and
would violate a portion of Proposal
2 that says state law cannot prevent,
restrict, obstructor discourage stem
cell research that otherwise would

Radicals advocating
violence against U.S.
arrested in raid
DETROIT (AP) - Federal
authorities yesterday arrested
several members of a radical
Sunni Islam group in the U.S., kill-
ing one of its leaders at a shootout
in a Michigan warehouse, the U.S.
attorney's office said.
Agents were trying to arrest
Luqman Ameen Abdullah, 53, at a
Dearborn warehouse on charges
that included conspiracy to sell
stolen goods and illegal possession
and sale of firearms. Authorities
also conducted raids elsewhere to
try to round up 10followers named
in a federal complaint.
No one was charged with ter-
rorism. But Abdullah was "advo-
cating and encouraging his
followers to commit violent acts
against the United States," FBI
agentGaryLeone.said in an affida-
vit filed with the 43-page criminal
complaint unsealed yesterday.
FBI spokeswoman Sandra Ber-
-htold said -Abdu lah- refused o
surrender, fired a weapon and was
killed by gunfire from agents.
In the complaint, the FBI said
Abdullah, also known as Chris-
topher Thomas, was an imam, or
prayer leader, of a radical group
named Ummah whose primary
mission is to establish an Islamic
state within the United States.
He told them it was their "duty
to oppose the FBI and the govern-
ment and it does not matter if they
die," Leone said.

Abdullah regularly preached
anti-government rhetoric and was
trained, along with his followers,
in the use of firearms, martial arts
and swords, the agent said.
Leone said members of the
national group mostly are black
and some converted to Islam
while in prisons across the United
States.
"Abdullah preaches that every
Muslim should have a weapon,
and should not be scared to use
their weapon when needed,"
Leone wrote.
Seven of the 10 people charged
with Abdullah were in custody,
including a state prison inmate,
the U.S. attorney's office said.
Three were still at large. Another
man not named in the complaint
also was arrested.
The group believes that a sepa-
rate Islamic state in the U.S. would
be controlled by Jamil Abdullah
Al-Amin, formerly known as H.
Rap Brown, who is serving a life
sentence in a federal prison in
Colorado for shooting two police
officers in Georgia in 2000, Leone
said. Al-Amin, a veteran of the
blaak -power movement, started
the group after he converted to
Islam in prison.
"They're not taking their cues
from overseas," said Jimmy Jones,
a professor of world religions at
Manhattanville College and a
longtime Muslim prison chaplain.
"This group is very much Ameri-
can born and bred."
The movement at one time was
believed to include a couple of
dozen mosques around the coun-
try. Ummah is now dwarfed in

numbers and influence by other
African-American Muslim groups,
particularly the mainstream Sun-
nis who were led by Imam W.D.
Mohammed, who recently died.
By evening, authorities still
were working the scene near the
Detroit-Dearborn border and the
warehouse was surrounded by
police tape.
The U.S. attorney's office said
an FBI dog was also killed during
the shootout.
Abdullah's mosque is in a brick
duplex on a quiet, residential street
in Detroit. A sign on the door in
English and Arabic reads, in part,
"There is no God but Allah."
Several men congregated on the
porch Wednesday night and sub-
sequently attacked a photographer
from The Detroit News who was
taking pictures from across the
street. Ricardo Thomas had his
camera equipment smashed and
had a bloody lip from the attack.
Imad Hamad, regional director
of the American-Arab Anti-Dis-
crimination Committee in Dear-
born, said the FBI had briefed him
about Wednesday's raids and told
himthey were the result of a two-
year investigation.
"We know that this is not some-
thingto be projected as something
against Muslims," Hamad said.
The complaint shows the FBI
built its case with the help of con-
fidential sources close to Abdullah
who recorded conversations.
A source said that Abdullah
regularly beat children inside the
mosque with sticks, including a
boy who was "unable to walk for
several days," Leone said.

Obama mulls sending
fewer to Afghanistan

Despite calls by
military leaders,
Obama considers
smaller surge
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama is consider-
ing sending large numbers of
additional U.S. forces to Afghani-
stan next year but fewer than his
war commander, Gen. Stanley
McChrystal, prefers, U.S. officials
said.
Such a narrowed military mis-
sion would escalate American
forces to accomplish the com-
mander's broadest goals, pro-
tecting Afghan cities and key
infrastructure. But the option's
scaled-down troop numbers like-
ly would cutback on McChrystal's
ambitious objectives, amounting
to what one official described as
"McChrystal Light."
Under the pared-down option,
McChrystal would be given fewer
forces than the 40,000 additional
troops he has asked for atop the
current U.S. force of 68,000, offi-
cials told The Associated Press
yesterday.
Senior White House officials
stressed, however, that the presi-
dent has not settled on any new
troop numbers and continues to
debate other strategic approaches
to the 8-year-old Afghanistan
war. The officials say Obama has
not yet firmly settled on the nar-
rowed option or any other as his
final choice for how to overhaul
the war effort.
Two officials, speaking on

condition of anonymity because
Obama has not announced his
decision, said the troop numbers
under the narrowed scenario
probably would be lower than
McChrystal's preference, at least
at the outset. The officials did not
divulge exact numbers..
The stripped-down version
of McChrystal's plan still would
adopt the commander's overall
goals for a counterinsurgency
strategy aimed at turning the
corner against the Taliban next
spring.
But that pared-down approach
would reflect a shift in thinking
about what parts of the war mis-
sion are most important and the
intense political domestic debate
over Afghan policy.
A majority of Americans either
opposethewarorquestionwheth-
er it is worth continuing to wage,
according to public opinion polls
dating to when Obama shook up
the war's management and began
a lengthy reconsideration of U.S.
objectives earlier this year.
Any expansion of the war
will displease some congressio-
nal Democrats. If Obama does
not meet McChrystal's request,
Republicans are likely to accuse
Obamaof failingto give McChrys-
tal all of what he needs.
A stripped-down approach
would signal caution in widen-
ing a war that is going worse this
year than last despite intense U.S.
attention and an additional 21,000
U.S. forces on Obama's watch.
Fourteen Americans were
killed Monday in Afghanistan
in two helicopter crashes, and
roadside bombings Tuesday left

eight U.S. troops dead. October
has been the worst month for
U.S. fatalities since the U.S.-led
invasion of Afghanistan began in
October 2001.
Even if McChrystal gets less
than he wants from Obama, the
U.S. may still end up adding more
troops later in 2010. The most
likely reason would be to fill voids
left by some NATO allies who
have been considering troop cut-
backs.
Defense Secretary Robert
Gates has pushed back hard
against a faction of administra-
tion officials, led by Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden, who contend that
much of the U.S. national security
objective in Afghanistan could be
accomplished by concentrating
on strikes at al-Qaida along the
Pakistan border.
That approach would hunt ter-
rorists with techniques such as
missile-loaded pilotless drones,
and could require little or no
additional U.S. manpower.
Gates has bridged both sides,
officials said. Long wary of a large
U.S. presence that could too eas-
ily look like an occupation army,
he has suggested recently that he
could support a carefully designed
expansion.
Obama meets Friday with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the mili-
tary leaders who would have the
responsibility for carrying out his
strategy decisions. White House
officials said the president will
continue to consider his options
with advisers over the nextcouple
of weeks, adding that other broad
war council meetings may still be
called during that period.

Doing the right thing
Senate should not delay passing Good Samaritan policy
W hen drinking laws actively criminalize people who
are doing the right thing, there's a problem. Thank-
fully, the "Good Samaritan" bill passed through the
state House of Representatives last week, paving the way for a
more reasonable law. This policy - which would exempt under-
age drinkers who call for help for intoxicated friends from receiv-
ing minor in possession charges - is something college campuses
need. The state Senate should pass the bill so that students who
might be hesitant to dial 911 during an emergency will no longer
have to fear penalties for being responsible.

State Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann Arbor)
originally introduced her "Good Samari-
tan" bill in March in response to concerns
that underage drinkers in need of medical
attention were going without it because
they feared getting MIPs. The bill would
amend the Michigan Liquor Control Code
and guarantee that intoxicated minors
will not receive an MIP charge for bring-
ing a friend to the hospital in the event of
an emergency. Brater's bill finally passed
the state House of Representatives last
week. It now heads to the Senate.
Regardless of one's personal feelings
about drinking laws, passage of the Good
Samaritan policy should be a no-brainer.
Upholding the letter of the law shouldn't
be prioritized over people's safety - the
lives of underage drinkers are much more
important. And while no one should hesi-
tate in an emergency, the fact that a medi-
cal emergency could be ignored because
of the fear of legal repercussions should
be enough to pass this bill as soon as pos-
sible.
Department of Public Safety spokes-
woman Diane Brown expressed unease
with the bill, saying that a possible MIP
shouldn't be a significant barrier to doing,
the right thing. But the fact is that the
threat of MIPs do impact students' choic-
es when put in the situation of whether
to call 911 or not. And while MIPs can, in

some cases, be removed from the records
of first-time offenders who undergo coun-
seling programs, students don't want to
deal with the impact that these conse-
quences - fines, court appearances and
the possibility of probation - can have on
their classes, extracurricular activities
and jobs. State law needs an exception that
allows underage drinkers to call for help
even if they have been drinking.
The fact that this bill is now closer to
implementation means that some thanks
are in order. In addition to Brater's sup-
port of this bill, the Michigan Student
Assembly endorsed the bill and wrote a
letter to legislators urging them to pass it.
And according to multiple sources cited
by MSA Business Rep. Alex Serwer in
yesterday's Daily, the letter "held great
significance in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee's proceedings." If this bill becomes
law, it will make the drinking climate on
campus much safer, and MSA will have
contributed in a meaningful way toward
improving the lives of University stu-
dents.
Alcohol-related emergencies shouldn't
go untreated or unnoticed because stu-
dents are afraidtof the~legal implications,.
The state Senate must pass the Good
Samaritan bill and do some good for
underage drinkers who want to make the
right decision in emergency situations.

his past Saturday, as halftime
was just beginning at the Big
House, I took my place in a
row of tuxedo-clad
groomsmensat my
brother's wedding.
The ceremony was
held in the atrium
of a gorgeous hotel,
with a sweeping
ceiling and foli-
age all around us.
And, to my sur-
prise, diners at the MATTHEW
adjoining hotel GREEN
bistro were able to
watch the wedding
from across a small
reflection pond.
I glanced at these curiously close
restaurant patrons from time to time
throughout the ceremony. Mostly
businessmen and hurried travelers,
they seemed uninterested in the wed-
ding at first. But as the service went
on, each became slowly transfixed
on the glowing bride and groom.
By the vows, some were apparently
even tearing up. The invited guests
were visibly moved, and I, of course,
started to cry the moment the bride
first appeared. Yet I was profoundly
astonished by the awed reactions of
the people in the restaurant.
I wondered how they could pos-
sibly be so moved to cry and cheer
at the sight of a stranger's wedding.
Their sentiments, obviously unre-
lated to any personal connection to
the~ bridal party, seemed~tn exem-
plify a collective awe at the institu-
tion of marriage. And in seeing this,
it finally hit me exactly how beautiful
marriage really is. Sure, a wedding is
supposed to make a person feel that
way. But while I could recognize that

my brother's marriage may not be as
smooth and perfect as his wedding
ceremony, I was awestruck by the
ceremony's affirmation of love ever-,
lasting.
The bride and groom's commit-
ment is something I can only hope I
may one day create with someone in
my own life. I often think about even-
tually getting married, but as a gay
man, I have a hunch it may be diffi-
cult as long as the law forbids it. With
the legality of same-sex marriage up
in the air, this wedding experience
made it clearer for me that while it
seems all but ignored in the current
debate, love should be the obvious
bottom line. Forget silly notions like
equality for a moment. Maybe same-
sex marriages should be allowed
solely because they're rooted in love
between two committed adults.
As is the case with so many hot-
button issues, the current debate has
become a war of words, removed from
what's really at stake. I think people
sometimes forget that what they're
actuallyarguingaboutishowdifferent
people experience the most beautiful
thing in life. I will never understand
how an expression of commitment
and caring could possibly be a disad-
vantage forsociety. Same-sexrelation-
ships may not be rooted in Western
tradition, but that doesn't somehow
make them a threat to this realm.
Nor will I understand how anyone
could be offended by two people's
desire to be a little less alone in this
world. Those who igse the Bible_
to bolster their blindness miss the
big picture. They dwell on contrived
verses here and there, taking for
granted the love and commitment
shared by Abraham and Sarah, for
instance, or Moses and Zipporah.

They entirely ignore the beautiful
and erotic Song of Solomon, essen-
tially an extended love poem, which
comprises an entire book of the Bible.
And when they do see these illustra-
tions of love and loyalty, they view
them two-dimensionally, between
a man and a woman. But the literal
sexuality of these Biblical characters
is irrelevant. Comprehending that
Isaac was a man and Rebekah was a
woman is less important than valu-
ing the love and dedication between
them. The Bible ought to be consid-
ered an ethical model, not a primitive
sex-ed pamphlet. Those who dwell on
the biblical definition of "sexual per-
version" are missing the point of the
bigger themes within the Bible.
Same-sex unions
possess that same
crucial quality.
As the battle over same-sex mar-
riage continues in the courts, I don't
care aboutofferingany furtherlogical
rationale for its legalization. Need-
less to say, love is not logical. Though
there are surely rational grounds for
its support, the need to legalize gay
marriage must first be realized in the
hearts of Americans. This weekend's
wedding reminded me that though
marriage j partlyabout"signijg a
contract, it is mostly a show of love.
And in the debate over gay marriage,
we should remember that.

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@UMICH.EDU

Selection of convention
delegates undemocratic
TO THE DAILY:
The University's leading role in defend-
ing diversity and academic freedom has
placed our campus in the national spot-
light. Our student body, starting with its
elected student leaders, has historically
led the nation in mobilizing students to
participate in key domestic and interna-
tional policies, not only for the universi-
ties but for the nation. We led Ivy League
schools and other prestigious American
institutions when we mobilized more than
50,000 people to successfully defend our
university's affirmative action policies at
the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003.
Following the state of Michigan's 2006
constitutional amendment banning affir-
mative action, our elected student leaders
should uphold the principles of diversity,
democracy, student rights, intellectual
freedom and debate. The current leader-
ship of the Michigan Student Assembly is
violating these principles by undermining
basic democracy in the selection of dele-
gates to a proposed constitutional conven-
tion. The current constitution requires
that delegates be elected to any constitu-
tional convention. But under the current
plan, the MSA President would handpick
the delegates based on an application and
interview process.
This policy is completely unconsti-
tutional and undemocratic. It would
effectively reduce the diversity of ideas
represented at the convention and make it
even more difficult for minority students
to be represented. This kind of selection
process for a constitutional convention
could allow the convention to amend
MSA's current constitution in such a way
that the document restricts democracy
and silences debate. The current executive
board of MSA has already proposed anti-

democratic measures and failed to win
anti-democratic constitutional reforms.
This is simply an attempt to win through
the back door what they could not achieve
in a democratically elected representative
body.
A constitutional convention must
include an open election to represent
the diverse interests of our student body.
Any amendments to our constitution that
come out of this kind of an undemocratic
process cannot be taken seriously by the
student body and will have no legitimacy.
We cannot allow the power and scope of
our central student government to be nar-
rowed and diminished by a few leaders
who fear an open debate and transpar-
ent discussion of issues that matter most
to students. Meaningful improvements in
the lives of students are less likely to occur
if democracy is curtailed.
It is becoming a common practice in
American politics to establish anti-dem-
ocratic regimes to attack the foundations
of public education. At a moment when so
much of the campus wants to stop more
tuition increases, streamline the finan-
cial aid system and fight for increasing the
amount of federal stimulus package fund-
ing earmarked for higher education, it is
unacceptable for the MSA president to be
leading the charge to shut down student
democracy. This is especially troubling
when the likely outcome of this policy
will be to suppress the democratic rights
of progressive, activist students and orga-
nizations, which should play a leading role
in the mobilization needed to win victo-
ries for students.
Only students can provide the leader-
ship needed to put the University back
on the road toward progress and equal-
ity. MSA's attempt to block democratic
decision making must be ended now. If a
constitutional convention is to occur, so
must open and fair delegate election. In
less than a month, elections for MSA rep-
resentatives will take place. Convention
delegate elections could be held then to

save the time and the expense that hold-
ing a separate convention delegate elec-
tion would incur.
Kate Stenvig
Rackham representative to MSA
MSA fairly determined
convention delegates
TO THE DAILY:
As recently reported in the Daily, the
Michigan Student Assembly is prepar-
ing to hold a constitutional convention to
rewrite the document that governs the
operations of MSA, student organizations
and to an extent, the student body (MSA
invites students to revise student constitu-
tion, 10/12/2009). While on the surface
this seems like another useless endeavor
by MSA, the current all-campus constitu-
tion, written 23 years ago, does not meet
the needs of a 21st century student body. A
rewrite is imperative to modernize the gov-
ernance of the students of this campus for
today and for the future.
While many students see the value and
importance of modernizing our constitu-
tion, there remain individuals, some of
whom sit on MSA, tryingtoundermine this
convention in an effort to further their own
political agendas. They question the legiti-
macy of this convention by calling it undem-
ocratic and charging that it will suppress
the views of minorities.
Racializing this issue and labeling it an
attack on democratic rights is a sideshow
andunderminestheverydemocratic princi-
ples these individuals claim to protect. The
true attack on the democratic rights of the
student body do not stem from the consti-
tutional convention, but rather from those
trying to block the actions of the democrati-
cally elected student assembly.
Earlier this semester, the assembly

unanimously approved the selection pro- V~ ewoint'
cedure for delegates to the convention. The
procedure called for the democratically A FA extrer
elected MSA president to appoint delegates
to this convention. Is it undemocratic when
people voice their will through elections?
Every representative who approved this TO THE DAILY:

Mathews looks to step
up as career winds down

BUILDING UP
A PROGRAM
The story behind the MICHIGAN SOCCER
new Michigan soccer HOME FIELD HISTORY
stadium - and the
benefits it will bring MEN'S SOCCER

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
After the Capital One Bowl in
January 2008, Wolverine fans had
Greg Mathews pegged as the next
top Michigan wideout.
His seven catches for 62 yards
made it hard not to get excited
about the wide receiver hanging in
the shadows of Wolverine standouts
Mario Manning-
ham and Adrian NOTEBOOK
Arrington. And
when those two left early for the
NFL, Mathews was left standing in
the spotlight.
But under new Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez, Mathews found
himself as a lone veteran in an
offense run by inexperienced quar-
terbacks. Struggling to find his role
and hampered by injuryearlyinthe
season, he finished 2008 with 38
catches, second on the team behind
then-freshman slot receiver Mar-
tavious Odoms.
A year later, it didn't look like
much had changed.
This season has been somewhat
of a bust for Mathews. He had the
game-winning catch against Notre
Dame, but overall, his performance
was far removed from the one he
showed in the Capital One Bowl.
Entering Michigan's matchup
against Delaware State on Oct. 17,
Mathews had tallied seven catches
the whole season - the same num-
ber the Orlando native had in his
hometown back on New Year's Day
in 2008.
Just 86 total yards at the sea-
son's midway point, a huge fumble
against Iowa on a kickoff return
and a dropped touchdown pass
against Michigan State left many
wondering what happened to Greg
Mathews.
"It's definitely my responsibility
to catch the ball any time the quar-
terback gets it near, so I take the
responsibility," Mathews said fol-
lowing Michigan's 26-20 overtime
pss q~t jggi, State.
But it looks like Mathews has
finally found his groove, even
though last Saturday's outcome
against-Penn State wasn't wlhat the
Wolverines would have liked. He
was freshman quarterback Tate

Senior Greg Mathews tied a career high against Penn State with seven catches, matching his 2008 Capital One Bowl total.

Forcier's favorite target, and tied a
career high with seven catches.
Rodriguez hinted that Mathews'
change in stride was very much
mental and that now is an ideal
time for him to improve.
"Sometimes in your senior year,
you see the end kind of coming to
the end of your college career,"
Rodriguez said. "Sometimes you
say, 'Now's the time for me to try to
do even more.'"
For Mathews to do more isn't an
issue of talent - he's proved he has
it on a number of occasions. Rather,
it's more Mathews venturing into
areas he has avoided during his
career. Rodriguez said the coaches
remarked during Tuesday's prac-
tice how the typically soft-spoken
wideout was excelling and stepping
out of his shell.
"He even took some more vocal
leadership rglpand was, havipg
some fun," Rodriguez said. "Greg's
an experienced guy that if he can
play well and make some big plays
for us, he can lift us offensively. I'm
really looking for big things from
him the rest of the season."

CISSOKO UPDATE: Boubacar
Cissoko's dismissal hasn't become
any less mysterious. Rodriguez
would not elaborate further on Cis-
soko's dismissal yesterday, restat-
ing the cornerback's boot came as a
"violation of team rules."
"As I told the team, all I do is
enforce the decisions that they
make," Rodriguez said. "As a coach,
that's our responsibility. ... As I
explained to the team, it's a privi-
lege - not a right - to be in the
program. Both on and off the field,
there are certain rules they have
to follow, and players understand
that. It's never pleasant to have to
do this."
Thomas Wilcher, Cissoko's
coach at Detroit Cass Technical
High School, said the dismissal was
a "combination of missing study
tables, missing class and missing
workouts." Prior to Rodriguez's
announcement Tuesday, Cissoko
had been suspended for two games
earlier this season.
Wilcher said he believes Cissoko
will transfer. Rodriguez would

not comment on the specifics of a
new destination for Cissoko, giv-
ing his standard response, "I only
talk about the players that play for
Michigan." But he did have some
words of advice for the sophomore.
"We certainly hope that not for
just Boubacar, but anybody else
that's been dismissed from the pro-
gram, that you try to help them in
the future if they learned their les-
son and do the right things," Rodri-
guez said. "That will be the case
if he gets right academically, does
what he is supposed to do. Hope-
fully, he can continue his career
elsewhere."
INJURY UPDATE: Odoms did
not practice Monday or Tuesday
due to a swollen knee he suffered
against Penn State. Rodriguez said
he responded well to treatment and
was expected to practice yesterday.
... Senior tailback Brajdonp, Mingt
was limited this week because
of a chronic high-ankle sprain....

knee last Saturday.

Daily Sports Writer
When Steve Burns first saw the
future of the Michigan men's soc-
cer team, he was with eight or nine
of his past players. The coach was
at a former player's wedding when
the preliminary drawings of the
proposed Michigan soccer stadi-
um were released.
"Theylookedatmeandshrugged
their shoulders like, 'Yeah, you
told us that we were going to have
a stadium, too. So I'll believe it
when I see it,'" Burns said.
Burns and his players had a
right to be skeptical. Ever since the
men's soccer program officially
became a varsity sport in 2000, it
hasn't had a home field.
But the new Michigan soccer
stadium could make up for lost
time. With a capacity of 2,200, it
may not be the largest college soc-
cer stadium, but it will meet Mich-
igan's high standards for building
a new sports venue.
It took a lot of work for the
coach to get the stadium to become
a reality, but without Burns, there
wouldn't be a men's soccer pro-
gram in the first place.
As a Michigan student, he
played on the men's club soccer
team from 1984 to 1988, and then
came back to coach it in 1992.
When Burns was earning his
Masters in Kinesiology in 1998,
he researched how he could con-
vince the Athletic Department to
approve men's soccer as a varsity
sport. His work culminated in a
32-page report to persuade Ath-
letic Director Bill Martin to grant
the sport varsity status.
.,Buos -Atrtpd the, push for soc-
cer facilities at Michigan, but,
women's coach Greg Ryan helped
to seal the deal. He was hired in
2008 to turn around a porotts pio-'
gram that had gone 20-25-16 the
previous three years, including a
three-win campaign in 2007.
Ryan took over the program in
the spring of 2008 and led Michi-
gan to a 4-10-5 record in a rebuild-
ing year. Like the men's team,
Ryan's squad hasn't had qual-
ity facilities since its inception in
1994.
With both teams becoming
more prominent at the university,
the coaches were able to havea say
in the construction of a stadium
that will make its mark on Michi-
gan soccer.

"Money," he said bluntly. It was
one of the same reasons the men's
program waited so long to become
a varsity sport.
The new stadium is partpf a
project that will cost six million
dollars, and is directly funded
by the Intercollegiate Athletics
resources and gifts fund. With
O'Neill Construction of Ann Arbor
winning the bid, construction
started this week on the current
site of the soccer complex.
"I think that we're bringing
the Soccer Complex, including
the fields and the stadium, up to
the level that you would expect a
Michigan team to have," Steven-
son said. "We have been way, way
behind the eight-ball with soc-
cer facilities from the day that we
added the men's team. ... I think
we're finally getting it to where it
needs to be."
The teams currently play at the
three-field U-M Soccer Complex,

at the center of the facility.

will continue to practice on the

Communication a key for D'

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
Junior goalie Bryan Hogan's
biggest strength became his big-
gest weakness.
Michigan had just tied the game
2-2 last Saturday against Bos-
ton University. Hogan went out
to play the puck to his defense, a
strong point in his game. While in
the corner, the Terrier forecheck
disrupted the pass and Boston put
the puck into the wide open net.
"I looked at his puck touches,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said. "He probably made 15 good
plays and then one not-so-good
play and it cost us a goal. He didn't
get any support from his defense-
men, either. They were all - not
asleep at the switch but not
sensing danger either.
"They were just taking it for
granted that Hogan would get
them the puck."
The rare puck-handling mis-

take from Hogan, who Berenson
says "might be the best puck-
handling goalie we've had since
(Marty) Turco," revealed a deeper
issue amongthe team - the lack of
communication between Hogan
and the defense.
With a startlingsilence between
the two parties and Hogan being
very active outside of the crease,
the coaches have seen the defen-
semen automatically anticipate
that Hogan will get the puck to
them.
But when the defensemen are
wrong on their assumptions, they
tend to put themselves out of posi-
tion.
On the game-winning goal Sat-
urday, sophomore Brandon Burlon
was in the far corner expecting
the pass from Hogan and senior
Chris Summers was on the half
boards also looking for a quick
pass. Neither could touch Terrier
forward Joe Pereira before he put
it in the empty net.

"Anytime the puck comes in,
and the goalie's going to have to
handle it, let's expect danger,"
Berenson said. "We can expect
him to make the play, but if he
doesn't or gets a bad bounce, then
we can step in and help."
More communication will lead
to better defensive-zone cover-
age. With the defense telling
Hogan what it wants to do with
the puck, usually to either "leave
it" behind the net or to "play it"
up to a Wolverine, it can send one
man to receive the puck while the
other gets into a more defensively
responsible position.
This chatter can also lead to a
better transition from the defense
to offense. When Hogan receives
the puck on a dump-in behind the
net, the defensemen can tell him
where to go to with it, and he can
then connect on a long outlet pass
to create an odd-man rush the
other way.
"We've been working on that

in practice, just defense-goalie
dump-ins and literally calling
what we want done," Burlon said.
"(Using) the exact words we want
to use with Hogie just so he knows
what's going on, so we avoid any
of that confusion later on in the
season."
The defensemen will need that
communication as Hogan takes
the net this weekend in Sault Ste.
Marie againstLake Superior State.
With the nation's No. 15 scoring
offense, the Lakers will pounce on
any Wolverine lapse.
But the strengthened relation-
ship in the defensive zone has
Michigan optimistic that it has
learned from its faults.
"I think this weekend will be
a big test for me and the defen-
semen to move the puck a lot,"
Hogan said.
"I think it's going to be a lot
better for sure since we're on the
same page now. Before, we were
just kind of wingingit."


Kopmeyer named Big Ten Rookie of the Week


By STEPHEN NESBITT
For theDaily
After shutting down the Wis-
consin offense on Sunday, redshirt.
freshman goalie Haley Kopmeyer
etched her name into the Michigan
record books and earned another
Big Ten Rookie of the Week title -
her second in three weeks.
With the 0-0 standstill in Ann
Arbor, Kopmeyer received her
fifth shutout in 12 starts this sea-
son, which tied Megan Tuura's
2003 record for shutouts by a first-
year goaltender. Kopmeyer still
has three regular-season games
left to break it. The rookie goalie
was quick to credit her teammates,
who have allowed just five goals in
nine games since Sept. 16.
"(The record) is a real honor,"
said Kopmeyer, who has kept the
starting position since the fourth

game of the year. "It kind of shows
how well we've been doing as a
defense ... and for me personally to
get my ankle better and come back,
it's just kind of nice to see it's pay-
ingoff."
The scoreless game saw the
Michigan keeper, who struggled
with injuries during her redshirt
year, improve her record to 3-4-5
in net, while lowering her goals-
against average to 0.97 goals per
game, the fifth-best mark in Michi-
gan history.
The win also helped Kopmeyer
improve her unbeaten home record
to 3-0-4.
Second-year head coach Greg
Ryan commended his goalie on
her accomplishments, but also
gave credit to the Michigan team
as a whole (0-2-5 Big Ten, 5-7-5
overall) for limiting the number
of opponent scoring opportuni-

ties all season. Kopmeyer has
maintained the third-best save
percentage in team history to this
point, with a .845 save percentage
on 71 shots.
"Haley is the back line of
defense," Ryan said. "She is play-
ing really well, but all the players
in front of her are doing a great job
of limiting the scoring chances. I
think that is a credit to the whole
defense."
Kopmeyer was selected as the
Big Ten Rookie of the Week after
she held Minnesota and Wiscon-
sin scoreless for 220 consecutive
minutes, following an early goal
to the Golden Gophers on Friday.
"It's great to see that the hard
work is paying off," Kopmeyer said.
"It's a nice compliment to receive,
and it's a compliment not only to me
but also our defense."
Teammates have been impressed

with her performance and are
grateful that she gives the team
an opportunity to win each game,
even with a struggling offense that
is averaging under 1.06 goals per
game.
"She has really been great for us,"
junior team captain Jackie Carron
said of Kopmeyer's importance to
the team. "Having Haley so confi-
dent really makes (the team) confi-
dent in ourselves, and it has helped
us play better together."
Ryan said it is important to have
players like Kopmeyer around for
the next few years to guide the
young team, which will lose just
three seniors at the end of the sea-
son.
"Every player on this team that
contributed to our success this year
has been a partof building the foun-
dation of the future, and Haley has
been a big partof that," Ryan said.

HIGHLAND, Calif. (AP) - For
two decades after her son's bomb-
er went down in the Pacific Ocean
during World War II, Vella Stinson
faithfully wrote the U.S. govern-
ment twice a month to ask if his
body had been found - or if any-
one was looking.
The mother of six strapping
boys went to her grave without the
answer that has finally reached
her two surviving sons 65 years
later: the remains of Sgt. Robert

environment," he said. "One way of
supportingthat is through thistype
of housing."
Though Samberg's project is
residential, University Prof. of Sus-
tainable Enterprise Andy Hoffman
said commercial projects are the
more likely candidates for green
construction.
"One of the problems with resi-
dential green construction is that
people switch homes too quickly,"
he said. "So big corporations like
universities get all the benefits of
green construction."
Hoffman said it is a "basic fact"
that there is an increasing trend
in green construction, but be isn't
sure about the underlying reasons
as to why.
"I think it's driven probably more
by economics than it is by actual
concern for the environment."
University Planner Susan Gott
said there are a number of initia-
tives currently at the University to
promote and encourage eco-friend-
liness on campus. Included are
programs like the campus-wide
conservation campaign Planet Blue
and the increased variety of recy-
cling options in residence halls.
I Gott said all these programs are
changing with time, but that the
University is trying to make resi-
dence halls and all campus build-
ings more eco-friendly by better

Many restaurants affiliated
with S2YD can also be found on
EatBlue.com, one of the company's
main competitiors.
Demchick explained how S2YD

"We employ drivers and basi-
cally the way it works is people can

With this new process, students

who apply to the University with
a GPA over a 4.0 will not have an
advantage since admissions officers
will continue to review the entire
transcript, looking at how the stu-
4ent responded to the courses avail-
able at their high school.
"What we're going to still do

Military divers recovered
several pieces of leg bone from
the wreckage of a B-24J Libera-
tor bomber found at the bottom
of the ocean off the coast of the
island nation of Palau. DNA test-
ing showed the femur fragments
belonged to the 24-year-old flight
engineer who died in combat on
Sept.1, 1944.
Stinson's remains arrived under
U.S. Air Force escort Wednesday
and will be buried Friday at River-
side National Cemetery with full
military honors. In between, the
body will be kept at a mortuary
less than 100 yards from the home
where Stinson grew up with his
brothers.
"He's not someplace on a lit-
tle island or at the bottom of the
ocean. He's home," said Edward
managing water use, reducing
lighting during construction and
increasing the amount of insulation
in buildings. ~
"We're an evolving institution,"
she said. "We're always responding
to new demands and new opportu-
nities."
She said that the University uses
LEED as a checklist for measur-
ing sustainability performance on
their projects.
Though it won't be LEED-certi-
fied, Gott said North Quad is a good
example of the University's green
efforts since it will have "optimum
insulation."
Andy Berki, manager of Envi-
ronmental Sustainability for the
Department of Occupational
Safety and Environmental Health
discussed in an e-mail a few sub-
stantial savings the University has
experienced through eco-friendly
projects.
In five PlanetBlue pilotbuildings,
energy consumption has decreased
by 6 percent, he wrote, resulting in
an annualized saving of $340,000.
Based on the estimated annual
energy consumption, Berki wrote
that North Quad could net an
approximate $300,000 in annual
savings.
He also discussed the solar col-
lector on the roof of the Central
Power Plant, which results in
around $4,000 savings annually.
And the trend isn't just limited to
campus here in Ann Arbor.
Atthe University of Colorado, the

taurant and they will make the

Looking into the future Dem-
chick said the goal of the company
is to continue growing.
"The bigger we expand, the bet-
ter," he said. "I guess we're trying
to basically make every restaurant
accessible to every student regard-
less of if they have a car or if it's
nice outside. We want to make
sure if they want any restaurant

them."
is that we're going to look at the
courses that were available in the
school and we're going to look at
how many of those courses the stu-

it in the context of other students

from the high school and we're
going to look at the grades they
made in those courses," Spencer
said.

Stinson, who was 9 when his
brother died.
For Robert Stinson, the journey
home was far from a sure thing.
Stinson's family knew only that
his bomber had gone down in the
Pacific Ocean after being hit by
anti-aircraft fire. The government
politely responded to his mother's
letters but said again and again
that no new information had sur-
faced.
The family learned that Stinson,
who joined the Army Air Forces
right out of high school, won sev-
eral medals in the summer of 1944
for participating in dangerous
attacks on Japanese airdomes,
military installations and enemy
ships. His plane was dubbed
"Babes in Arms."
In 1994, a nonprofit group of

adventurers and scuba divers
began to search for the miss-
ing bomber off the waters of
Koror, Palau's biggest island. The
15-member group, called Bent-
Prop, travels to the island nation
each year for a month to search for
some 200 missing U.S. World War
II aircraft.
Half of the wrecks scattered in
the waters around the archipelago's
300 tiny islands have missing crew
members associated with them,
said Daniel O'Brien, a member of
the BentProp team. Stinson's plane
had 11 crew members - and there
were eyewitness reports of where
it went down. Eight crew members
went down with the plane; three
parachuted out, but were captured
by the Japanese and are believed to
have been executed.

en each year.
Despite the drop in underrep-
resentedminorityrepresentation,
the number of underrepresented
minorities applying to the Uni-
versity has increased in the last
two years.
Rackham student David Green
asked what the University has
been doing to maintain diversity
at the University since the state
banned affirmative action.
Coleman said despite the pas-
sage of that ban, she was pleased
the University didn't suffer the
"dramatic decline" that schools in
California and Washington expe-
rienced when the states passed
similar proposals.
Another student asked if,
similar to the rise in overall
undergraduate applications, the
number of minority applicants
had increased.
Though Coleman didn't know
the exact number of minority
students who applied, she said
the increase was an "encourag-
ing sign." Coleman said though
an increasing number of minor-
ity students were applying to the
University and being admitted,
fewer are choosing to enroll.
"If we were in a position where
families are saying, 'Look, don't
even bother to apply to Michi-
gan,' " Coleman said. "That's a
very different problem."
Coleman said underrepresent-
ed minority students have many
options when it comes to choos-
ing a college and the University
can't match schools that offer
scholarships that the Univer-
sity cannot provide because of
restrictions on minority-targeted
scholarships.
While the University cannot
.giv .similar scholarshipsCole-
man said there are other things
administrators can do to increase
minority enrollment, like com-
munity outreach.
On Tuesday, Coleman traveled
to Detroit and met with counsel-
ors, principals and the superin-
tendent of Detroit Public Schools
to discuss strategies for increas-
ing minority enrollment at the
University.
"We had a wonderful conver-
sation about things that we could
do to help," Coleman said. "So
we're on it."
However, one student said
minorities often are discouraged
from applyingto the University -
citing his high school counselor
who told him not to apply to the
University because he wouldn't
succeed.
Coleman said she had a similar
conversation while talking this
week with educators in Detroit
who said they didn't want stu-
dents to be discouraged by the
University's academic vigor
when the work is easier at other

colleges.
In response, Coleman said stu-
dents should never be discour-
aged from applying in fear that
they won't achieve academic suc-
cess.
"I said 'Look, first of all, you
can't predict (what will happen).
You come in, you get going, you'll
blossom and it's so worth it to
you at the end of the day to have
this Michigan degree,' "Coleman
said.
Walter Lacy, a Kinesiology
student currently taking time
off, said campus segregation
exists. He questioned Coleman
on how racial tensions can be
eased.
Coleman said she believes it's
very important that students,
faculty and administrators see
each other as human beings and
that the University has many
programs that encourage inter-
group dialogue.
"I think we have a number
of ways to try to get people to
get to know each other and see
each other as individuals and as
human beings and not as mem-
bers of any particular group," she
said.
She added that many students
come from "very homogeneous"
high schools, where they haven't
interacted with people of other
races, backgrounds or religious
beliefs.
"It becomes asmatter of how do
you break down those walls. How
you get people to see each other,"
she said. "It's an issue."
However, Coleman noted that
a high percentage of alumni has
responded in surveys that their
exposure to diversity at the Uni-
versity helped them be success-
ful in their careers.
"That's not to say that things
don't happen on the campus, but
I think we work pretty hard at
it, and it's pretty effective," she
said. "But we've got to always
work at it."
After the chat, Lacy said in an
interview that he was not sat-
isfied with Coleman's answers
about race and diversity.
"It sounded like a general
statement. It's something I've
heard before in public speeches
and just in general discussion,"
Lacy said. "That is the response
you get about race. That is, 'we're
doing the best we can."'
He added that he thinks there
is "deep-seated racism that exists
at Michigan."
LSA senior Andrew Dalack,
outreach chair for Students
Allied for Freedom and Equal-
ity, a pro-Palestinian campus
group, had a different opinion
and said he thought the chat
went well.
"I always admire President
Coleman," he said. "I think she
has great leadership style, and
she has great pioneering ideas for
the University."

This house on Packard St. is being renovated to be the first LEED-certified private

student housing in Ann Arbor.
39-year-old Environmental Center
has guided sustainability efforts on
campus. In addition to greening the
Colorado campus, the center aims
to educate students about conserv-
ing the environment.
In addition to educating stu-
dents, the center works with other
divisions on CU's campus - like
housing and dining - to promote
sustainability.
Casey LeFever, Housing and
Dining Promotions coordinator for
Manager Nick Oliverio of Max
& Erma's on East Eisenhower
Parkway said the new service
will definitely mean more student
customers ordering from his res-
taurant.
"It's been picking up kind of
steady since September when
the school got back in," he said.
"You're going to target it a lot at
the dorms. I mean that's who we
were targeting initially."
Oliverio also commented on the
success of the deliveries.
"So far it's been great," he
said. "We have plans to keep it
going just the way it's going right
now."
Owner Sukhdial Singh of the
Quizno's located on South Main
well in those you won't be advan-
taged in our system," Spencer con-
tinued. "It will remain the same,
virtually."
Spencer said that after research-
ing the issue, the difference in
recalculated GPAs did not signifi-
cantly change students' GPAs. Sul-
livan said the average change was
as little as 0.08 points on a four-
point scale.
Dick Tobin, director of college
counseling at Greenhills School in
Ann Arbor, said admissions offices

the center, wrote in an e-mail that
the center has been implementing
many programs to increase sus-
tainability in residence halls.
"Being green often means saving
money,"hewrote in the e-mail. "For
example, just last year, CU's Dining
Services eliminated disposable cof-
fee cups in their dining halls. This
meant hundreds of thousands of
cups were diverted from the land-
fill, and less money was spent by the
dining halls."
Street said the reason he got
involved with S2YD was really to
help the students.
"I can go to the students and
maybe their needs are a little far
away from me so that way I can
reach them and give them busi-
ness ... So I'm just helping myself
and helping them," he said.
However, Singh said business
hasn't been good enough for him
to keep working with S2YD and
the results of the partnership have
been mixed.
"It's not easy for me as a fran-
chise owner," he said. "Quizno's
took 11 to 12 percent, then (S2YD)
took (money). I want it to improve,
but I don't know, we will see ... I
can wait a few more months."
at many colleges and universities
around the country do not recalcu-
late GPAs.
He said he believes this change is
understandable, given the amount
of time it took to recalculate GPA.
"I think that the GPAs that Mich-
igan will work with, the ones that
we submit, and this is what they've
found, will be almost identical to
what they were finding when they
recalculated," Tobin said. "So -in
that way I don't think there will be
a difference."


VIGIL
From Page 1A
light vigil was just the beginning
of what the Black Student Union
hopes to accomplish.
"We want to commemorate,
but we also want to instilla move-
ment," James said.
The ceremony opened with
the singing of "Lift Every Voice
And Sing" - the Black National
Anthem- andthenacknowledged
the death of many individuals lost
to urban violence by reading their
names aloud.
Members of the Michigan Gos-
pel Chorale sang in memory of all
the victims and the treasurer of
the Black Student Union, Kortni
Malone, recited Maya Angelou's
poem "Million Man March."
Brittney Williams, the group's
community outreach chair, sang
"Amazing Grace" before Walter
Lacy, a Kinesiology student cur-
rently taking time off, recited
another poem that was dedicated
to two boys lost to inner-city vio-
lence.
Finally, the floor was opened
for participants to give remarks
about urban-youth brutality.
One student spoke specifically
about African Americans at the
University of Michigan. He said
these lucky few must understand
they are the exception in the
African-American community,
and the ultimate hope is that this
exception will become the rule.
Most of those who spoke up at
the event agreed that the African-

American community must open
itself up to change and lead others
by example.
McClendon said this shift can
and will occur.
"I really do feel that change
takes place within oneself and
then from there it gets conta-
gious," he said. "I've been affected
by change. Inspirational instruc-
tors I've had changed my para-
digm, changed my approach,
changed my outlook."
"Just as theyhave that power to
change and affect me, I have that
same power to affect and change
someone else," he continued. "I
can guarantee that a change is
going to take place because it is
going to take place within me."
Kinesiology junior Darren
Craddieth agreed, saying that the
African-American community
will evolve.
"A lot of our youth feel like they
have no help and they have no way
out, so we just have to be that way
out for them and let them know
anything is possible for them," he
said. "We have fought for all of our
lives, coming from slavery to now,
so we just have to be that differ-
ence."
LSA senior Crystal Irving said
it is the responsibility of African-
American students at the Uni-
versity to lead others in the right
direction.
"There is already enough sad-
ness and depression in the world,
there is just no more room for any
kind of situation like this," she
said. "It is definitely our job to step
in and intervene."

Inside the new home of Michigan soccer

From STADIUM, page 5A
site. In years past, both teams have
fell victim to uncertain practice
fields and home games outside of
Ann Arbor.
The stadium will add another
venue to the unofficial second ath-
letic campus, which has popped up
at the end of State Street. The Var-
sity Tennis center, the future wres-
tling center and the gymnastics
team are also located in the area.
The stadium will be solely used
for the soccer teams. To prepare,
the Athletic Department consult-
ed both of the Michigan soccer
coaches.
"I think Steve and I both agreed
that we wanted to have a really
intimate setting," Ryan said. "We
didn't care how large the stadium
was, we wanted it to have great
atmosphere. And we wanted to
have it be consistent with all of the
other great Michigan facilities."
The stadium will have a large
grandstand on the west side of the
field, and the exterior will be red
brick, similar to the baseball and
softball fields.
It's the first stadium in the
short history of Michigan soccer,
and even though its 2,200-person
capacity isn't the largest in the
Big Ten, it should achieve Ryan's
desired effects.
Since the coaches want to
encourage attendance, they sug-
gested that a four-row stand be
placed on the east sideline and a
roof be placed over both the east
and west side seating structures.
Burns also proposed that install-
ing dense netting could enhance
the atmosphere even more. That
way, with the stands, the roof and
the darker netting, the stadium
would have a closed, caged-in feel,
and give it a European flavor.
"If ever you watch a European
game, it has that excitement and
that atmosphere and the players
really feed off of that," junior Cam
Cameron said.
But the students and fans need
come to gaines in order to create
the atmosphere that the stadium is
being built to support.
Currently, fans sometimes pack
the metal bleachers that are only
on the west side of the field. But
the average attendance of a men's
game is 880 fans, and just 609 for

cOURTESYOF THEMICHIGAN ATHLETIc DEPARTMENT
The Michigan men's and women's soccer teams will finally have a permanent home next year, The Athletic Department broke ground on the new complex earlier this week.

women's games.
"One of the big things that
we're really hoping for is to make
that connection with the student
body," Burns said. "So that they
know that this east sideline is
four rows, it's got a roof on it (and)
that's where we want that fan base
to be extremely rowdy."
FINALLY "LEGIT"
Cameron said he was excited to
play in the new stadium since it
would finally make soccer a "legit"
sport at Michigan.
The players are excited for the
stadium, but the coaches will be
reaping the rewards of the Athletic
Department's investment, too.
"When you look at how you
can recruit out of that top pool

of talent, they're looking at three
things," Burns said. "Do you have
a history of putting players in the
pros? ... Then, they look at facilities
... and the other thing they look at
is a track record of winning cham-
pionships.
"Now we're looking at two out
of three, and it's going to be a lot
easier to pull players out of that
top pool and make it three out of
three."
Ryan agreed that a state-of-the
art stadium would be a draw for
recruits, and Burns added that the
stadium will be a model that other
schools would follow.
"For me, it's what I wanted to
bringto Michigan," Ryan said ofthe
stadium. "When I came to Michi-
gan and saw the lack of facilities

for soccer, and some other lacks,
I thought this may be the greatest
challenge of my coaching career."
Ryan is in the middle of rebuild-
ing his team. Before he came to
Ann Arbor, he said that because
of a lack of facilities and a lack of
success, a potential recruit would
look around and say, "No, there's
no reason for me to come here."
"And now to play in that stadi-
um and have people in the stands
and the girls on the field and say
Michigan is a first-class place
that has full backing of the Ath-
letic Department," Ryan said. "To
me, that's going to be a personal
accomplishment just to see it done.
I know I'm just going to be one lit-
tle piece, or part of it, but I'm going
to be so proud of Michigan for get-

ting this done."
From 1997 to 2004, the women's
program made the NCAA Tourna-
ment every year. With the added
benefit of a new venue, Ryan could
soon have the team back on track.
The men's program also has had
its own success at times. In its first
nine seasons as a varsity sport, the
men's soccer team has made the
NCAA Tournament three times -
2003, 2004 and 2008. It has been
a long journey for Burns and the
men's soccer program, that will be
on display when the stadium opens
next year.
In the men's soccer locker room,
there is a Bob Marley lyric on the
wall from the song "No Woman No
Cry." It reads, "In this great future,
you can't forget your past." Burns

tries to make sure his players don't
forget where the soccer program
came from.
And it will likely be an emo-
tional day for everyone when the
stadium opens in 2010.
"At times, even without a sta-
dium, I'll be out here on my own
at the end of a practice and I'll
look around at the fact that we
have three full-time soccer fields,"
Burns said. "And it's a little over-
whelming. I get a little choked
up. I think that if there's a cam-
era on me when we first open the
stadium, you're certainly going to
be seeing a guy that's humble and
maybe shedding a tear."

'HOW A MICHIGCAN
STUDENT IS
REAWAKENING AN
ANCIENT ARTFORM

Encaustic painting is an involved process requiring the use of a variety of materials and instruments including
scalpels, heat guns, wax and resin.

BY LEAH BURGIN
DAILY ARTS WRITER

n the quiet darkness just before morn-
ing, LSA senior Ariela Steif leans over
her work table. Passersby - if there
were any - would be presented with
a peculiar scene: Framed in the window of
her first floor apartment, Steif is surrounded
by brushes of every size and shape, scalpels, a
heat gun and a heating tray filled with cans of
molten colored wax.
The window is open. The sound of buzz-
ing and the smell of paint fumes fill the air.
Her medium, known as encaustic painting, is
as ancient as the Greeks, though it is now an
obscure art form. This type of painting, using
a combination of beeswax, resin and pigment,
is labor intensive - the colored wax must be
heated to the right temperature, mixed a very
specific way and applied quickly before it
cools. The art commands her attention:
The process is long and complex: Multi-col-
ored layers of wax are added to the canvas, and
each addition mustbe reheated and fused to its
hardened predecessors. Most encaustic artists
go through many periods of adding wax, fus-
ing it, chipping it away and adding more wax
until they achieve the desired effect. So why
would an artist, in this age of instantaneous
results, take the time to revive such an archaic
art form? Why deal with such a tedious medi-
um? Steif says that, for her, the dividends are
worth the painstaking effort.
"It's an incredibly difficult medium to mas-
ter. It took me months and months and months
to learn - learning how to control the wax,
choosing the right tools and implements, a
thousand different things," she said.
"From the angle you hold the heat gun
to mixing different colors, there's just so
many things to learn. But there are so many
effects you can achieve. You can bury things
in encaustic, like paper. You can build up mul-
tiple layers. And this depth is important to the
concepts I have been exploring."
It is a combination of encaustic painting's
qualities of translucency and depth that

draws Steif to the medium. Steif has been
working in encaustic since her sophomore
year. Originally an oil painter and water-
colorist, she chose to switch to encaustic
because the medium better fit her expressive
nature. Over the past two years, this inter-
est has grown into a dedication to encaustic
painting and has recently resulted in a solo
installation in the Michigan Union.
"It comes down to the way I paint or the
themes that I'm interested in. I've always been
interested in looking at marginalia and things
that are not one thing or another. They're sort
of in between," Steif said.
"And encaustic fits that really well because
it's sometimes a solid and it's sometimes a
liquid. It's sometimes opaque and sometimes
transparent. It exists in this strange region in
between all of these things. It works well with
what I want to say."
According to Steif's artist statement (a
description of the medium and her artistic
intentions), she is interested in representing
"fragments of dreams and memories" and
exploring "the interstices of things, sites of
liminality." It should be no surprise that she
chooses to paint in the early morning - a time
when dreams and memories are still connect-
ed and the day has not quite begun. And she
draws from multiple sources for inspiration.
"In medieval folklore the spaces in the mar-
gins, those which are betwixt and between
- the edge of the sea, between night and day,
doorways and thresholds - were thought to
be dangerous places of power and transfor-
mation," Steif wrote in her artist statement.
"These marginal spaces are reflected in the
region that my paintings occupy: the no-man's
land between representation and non-repre-
sentation."
Encaustic, rooted inthe Greek wordencaus-
tikos - meaning "to burn in" - was first men-
tioned by Pliny the Elder in his manuscript
"Naturalis Historia." According to Pliny, the

TRAILER REVIEW
"BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS"
FIRST LOOK
The trailer for "Bad Lieutenant" employs a clever bit of misdirection, setting the
filmup as aharrowing, topical (Hurricane Katrina!) police dramafeaturing a snarky
cop (Nicholas Cage) who injures himself performing an honorable act. But once the
title card flashes the name of legendary director Werner Herzog, you know some
crazy shit is going to go down. Indeed it does, with Cage snorting coke, maniacally
fist-bumping gangsters and having hallucinations of iguanas. Now that he's done
treasure hunting, it's going to be fun to see Cage tripping balls.

Big-screen bailout

All shallow's eve

Why one Michigan
director is fighting to
protect film incentives
By JACK PORTER
Daily Arts Writer
Michigan's Film Tax Incentive is a
provocative piece of legislation that
has incited passion in many film buffs
- friends and enemies alike. The incen-
tive's 40-percent tax-refundable credit
for filmmakers is currently the highest
offered in any state and has attracted
many Hollywood-based and local pro-
ductions. Famously, Clint Eastwood's
film "Gran Torino" was shot in Michi-
gan after the incentives were passed.
Drew Barrymore's "Whip It," a more
recent example, was filmed in the greater
Detroit area as well.
Some lawmakers, however, claim the
state can't afford to keep making big pay-
outs to filmmakers. There's a possibility
that the incentive could be decreased or
capped to curb state spending. Advocates
of the bill in its original form argue that
changes will only flaunt Michigan's eco-
nomic instability, which could cause Hol-
lywood to look for greener pastures.
Michigan director and producer Mike
Manasseri shares these sentiments. But
what sets him apart from other voices in
the debate is his unmatched devotion to
a simple cause: keep the incentive from
changing. To further this goal, he created
the non-profit advocacy group Big Screen
Michigan. The group emphasizes the eco-
nomic successes brought on by the incen-
tives thus far, especially the creation of
new jobs for Michigan.
Monday night, Big Screen Michigan

held a rally at the Crofoot Ballroom in
Pontiac. Manasseri spoke with the Daily
by phone before the rally.
A joint project with a local news sta-
tion convinced him of the incentive's posi-
tive effect on Michigan's economy. While
interviewing Michigander crew members
on the set of the upcoming remake "Red
Dawn," he heard personal stories that
inspired him to take action.
"One person after the next, over and
over, basically said 'I was laid off from
my job, I had to move out of the state, I
was going to lose my house,' " Manas-
seri recalled. "Before these incentives
were passed, they were in serious, serious
trouble. And here in person, they all said
'I've been working non-stop ever since the
incentives passed, and it has changed my
life.'"
One of his favorite stories from his
time working with Big Screen Michigan
involves a diner in Birch Run where part
of "Whip It" was filmed. The new own-
ers of the diner re-opened the restaurant
as a real-life version of the fictional "Oink
Joint" that appeared in the film.
"It's there now," he said. "They serve
a great pulled pork sandwich. I've been
there. I've eaten it."
Manasseri's passion for the cause is
palpable. He spoke with gusto about the
importance of the incentive for the Michi-
gan economy, describing it as "a bright
light that is shining on this state."
"We need to make sure that the legisla-
ture - who invited this industry in here
with a great incentive package - doesn't
start tinkering with it, changing it, cut-
ting it," he said. "Because when hundreds
of millions of dollars are at stake, these
companies will turn away, and we can't
have them do that."
Manasseri went on to answer critics

who fear that Michigan could be outbid or
wouldn't be able to sustain the incentive.
He turned to Louisiana as an example of a
successful film incentive program.
"They've had their incentive for a
decade," he said. "Because that infrastruc-
ture was given the time to take root - to
form a foundation Louisiana is doing
fine. They're still making terrific money.
Their workforce is still doing 'incredibly
well."
Manasseri also downplayed the incen-
tive's impact on the state budget.
"The entire incentive package for 2008
was less than one one-thousandth of the
state budget," he said. "There are so many
more important things (to single out) than
this, but because it is high-profile, because
it is Hollywood, it's an easy target."
Asked about upcoming movies to be
filmed in Michigan, Manasseri mentioned
"Highland Park," starring Danny Glover,
and "Game of Death," a remake of a Bruce
Lee film set to star Wesley Snipes.
After the rally, Manasseri shared his
thoughts on the event by e-mail.
"Great speakers and a terrific turnout,"
he wrote. "State Senators Gilda Jacobs and
Hansen Clarke took the stage followed by
Mitch Albom who really rocked the house
with a passionate speech."
While Michigan's Film Tax Incentive
is still in jeopardy, Manasseri's enthusi-
asm has already worked to mobilize sup-
porters. The issue has obviously attracted
strong opinions from a variety of view-
points, and whether or not the incentive
is actually helping Michigan, remains up
in the air. Regardless of the feasibility of
sustaining the tax incentive, Manasseri
at least. has his heart in the right place:
He's committed to helping fix Michigan's
economy while also bringing the state the
excitement of an active film industry.

ta's that time of year again, faithful
gossip devotees. All Hallow's Eve,
the favored holiday for anyone hop-
ing to channel his or her inner bimbo, is
just around the cor-
ner. While a sizable
female majority will
continue to capitalize
on the "slutty bunny
/ slutty cop / slutty a
prostitute" costume
bracket, this Hallow- SASHA
een is also likely be
dotted with innumer- RESENDE
able references to The
Summer of Celebrity Death.
Just as the late Heath Ledger's Joker
dominated 2008's festivities, expect to
see an overabundance of silver-gloved
Michael Jackson impersonators moon-
walking their way to the next kegger
this Saturday. The late infomercial king
Billy Mays's family has already learned
to embrace the cultural obsession with
commemorating celebrity death. Mays's
son is offering a prize to the three best
costumes immortalizing his father. In
order to properly pay homage to the late
mays, the prizebetter include astub of
OxiClean mixed with an eight-ball of
high-grade Colombian blow.
Speaking of snowy weather, let's
check in with Hollywood's A-list train-
wreck Lindsay Lohan. Try as I might
to write a single column neglecting to
mention Miss CokePants, the sometimes
actress and failed fashion designer con-
tinuously manages to generate highly
unflattering but entertaining press about
herself.
This week, LiLo's father Michael
Lohan - a man better known for his
repeated jail stints and his recent friend-
ship with Dad of the Year Jon Gosse-
lin - has reached out to his estranged
daughter in the best way possible: by
going on Maury to beg his little girl to
quit the drugs and get her life straight-
ened out. Oh yeah, and to maybe cut
him another check - things have been
a little tight lately with the recession
and all that. At least the man refrained
from commenting on Lindsay's unmen-
tionables, unlike Papa Winehouse,
who proudly announced to the world
that daughter Amy - and her recently
enhanced silicone breasts - is just fine.
Poor little LiLo reacted to unanimous
worldwide ridicule of her Ungaro fash-
ion line by going on a month-long bend-
er, passing out in nightclubs and causing
the weekly tabloids to speculate that the
end is near for hapless Lindz. Luckily,
her 15-year-old sister Ali - you know,
the one who briefly had an E! reality
show showcasing Dina Lohan's attempts
to turn her youngest daughter into a
cash cow - is in tow for the festivities,
joining her big sister for vodka-Red Bull
flavored nights on the L.A. nightclub cir-
cuit. At least if Lindsay's health doesn't
hold out, there will be another little
Lohan trainwreck to follow.
One person who won't be frequenting
the club scene for much longer is rap-
per Lil Wayne, who recently pled guilty
to second-degree gun possession and
will likely be sentenced to a year in the
pokey. Why exactly would a millionaire
recording artist, whose claim to fame is
comparing Blow Pops to oral sex, need
to pack heat on his tour bus? Appar-
ently he had to keep those crazed fans
in check. He's the second high-profile
hip-hop artist convicted of felony gun
charges this year, effectively stealing
T.I's thunder. Hopefully the two will
bond behind bars and release a mixtape
titled "Whatever You Like a Lollipop."
Martha Stewart will grace the cover art

and Plaxico Burress is expected to guest.
Shifting from the very real shackles
of prison to the metaphorical shackles of
parenthood, a slew of reality starlets are
set to give birth in the coming weeks.
Thank god; I was getting sick of relying
solely on the Gosselins for my weekly
dosage of televised child exploitation.
Former "Girls Next Door" Playboy
groupie Kendra Wilkinson has taken a
break from hawking her dumb-blonde
schtick and is showing off her expand-
ing belly for a variety of celebrity week-
lies. Thankfully she's expecting a boy,
so the child will be groomed for football
tournaments rather than magazine cen-
terfolds.
Kourtney Kardashian - the one
who didn't just put together a hasty
wedding and hasn't leaked a sex tape
yet - is also with child. She report-
edly became preggers after a series of
unprotected flings with her cheating
ex-fiance Scott Disick, who has now
been upgraded to temporary boyfriend.
The entire pregnancy, from the early
"Oh-shit-I-missed-my-period" stages
all the way to the tenuous "Should-I-
get-an-abortion?" debates, has been
captured by a live camera crew for
Kourtney's latest El reality show. These
tapes will be a lovely supplement to
'future "How You Were Born" conversa-
tions between Kourtney and her Little

Mays, win a prize!
Kardashian. Let's just hope the TV
crew doesn't capture the live birth for a
raw two-hour special.
Speaking of out-of-touch reality
starlets, aspiring singer Heidi Montag
recently dissed her own sister by refus-
ing to attend her birthday party. Heidi
allegedly opted out of the festivities
because wasn't goingto be paid for the
appearance. The fact that anyone would
pay Heidi to stare at a camera for 23
minutes every week, much less attend
an actual publicized event, is enough to
make even the most upbeat person lose
all faith in humanity.
Heidi's sister-in-law and "Hills"
co-star Stephanie Pratt is also fight-
ing her own battle to maintain media
relevance. The reality star was recently
arrested in Hollywood for suspicion
of driving under the influence. To her
credit, Stephanie is related to Spen-
cer Pratt, and if I had to deal with his
fame-whoring ways every day I'd be
pounding the vodka harder than Paula
Abdul
If you've been feeling like there has
been something intangible missing from
your life these past three weeks, there's
a likely answer. Disney pop-tart Miley
Cyrus recently quit Twitter, unceremo-
niously dumping the 2 million-plus fol-
lowers she had accumulated. Apparently
little Miley's newestboyfriend didn't
like that she was documenting her every
burp for a gaggle of fans. I'm sure Daddy
Billy Ray and the Disney execs had
absolutely no interest in preventing yet
another leak of a scantily-clad, mildly
racist photo.
What will the Twitteratti do now that
Hannah Montana isn't tweeting all her
profound thoughts for the masses? Are
they really expected to follow Audrina
freaking Patridge?
Resende needs more people to follow on
Twitter now that Miley's gone. E-mail her

Playing with fire: poi meets girl

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily TV/New Media Editor
This past summer I devoted my free time
to perfecting moves with names like the
"buzz-saw," "corkscrew" and "windmill"
so when I performed with fire, hopefully
I'd walk away unharmed. I had discovered
fire poi - an obscure performance art from
New Zealand - in the most unexpected
place: northern Michigan.
I spent my summer working in a tour-
ist town placed in the middle of northern
Michigan's expansive wilderness, and
after we exhausted the town's entertain-
ment (which didn't take long in a city
designed for families that came, saw and
bought souvenirs), my coworkers and I
turned to a summer of projects and hob-
bies. Some tackled books, others learned
to sew, many plowed through TV mini-
series. I discovered fire poi.
Poi is a performance art native to the
Maori culture and other indigenous popu-
lations of New Zealand. In the art, women
spin balls attached to the end of a cord
made from varying materials in a sort of
dance. The Maori people pair this art with
song, dance and storytelling. Original poi
was made from native plants, but today
there are many types including glow poi,
flag poi and, of course, fire poi.
In my favorite variety, the balls are

made from Kevlar wicks and the cord's
material is made from metal chain, and
after the Kevlar has soaked in kerosene,
the balls are set aflame. Often performed
in the dark, artists throw, toss and twirl
the fireballs around their bodies, creating
the visual effect of a performer encom-
passed in personal little infernos where

lines of flaming light seem to float in the
air around them.
It was a coworker who got me into fire
poi in the first place. Having spun fire for
over a year, she performed on weekends in
the most tourist-inundated district of town
hoping to make some extra money. Watch-
ing a fire poi performance is always mes-
merizing, but seeing it for the first time is
indescribable. My colleague was extremely
at ease. It was as though spinning fire with-
in inches of her hair and face was the most

natural thing in the world. She danced
without care to techno music while effort-
lessly spinning blazing circles and flowers
in the air with her poi, completely unaware
of the crowd she was attracting.
Here I was, stuck in a bizarre city with
50 hotels and two streetlights, watching
my friend perform an ancient Maori art.
Who knew this would happen? All I knew
was I had to try fire poi for myself.
I was quickly provided with a set of
practice poi (nothing more than a pair of
tennis balls stuffed into knee socks) and,
for the next few weeks, spent the major-
ity of my free time in front of a full-length
mirror swinging the tennis balls at my
sides and acquiring bruises. Eventually,
my spastic motions grew smoother - I
wasn't hitting myself in the face (as often)
and my bruises began to fade.
After a month of practicing with tennis
balls, I tried fire and'- because I escaped
without burns - never looked back. The
rush of spinning poi and sense of relief
that spilled over me once the fire went out
were the most satisfying feelings I have
ever experienced.
Ever since that first time, my curiosity
about poi has only grown. I started fre-
quenting websites and forums for poi and
found it has a pretty large following. What
started as a cultural dance in New Zea-

ENCAUSTIC
From Page 1B
Greeks invented this painting
technique circa the 5th and 4th
centuries B.C.E. It is believed
that when Homer mentions the
"painted ships" of the Greek
fleet in "The Iliad," he is refer-
ring to the rudimentary encaustic
that ancient Greek ship-builders
would apply to waterproof their
vessels.
Encaustic works eventually
moved from purely utilitarian
usage into the realm of art. The old-
est surviving examples of encaustic
paintings are the Fayum portraits,
wooden boards on which realistic
portraits of mummified individu-
als were depicted. Well preserved
in the dry Egyptian heat, these
rare artistic relics have remained
vividly colored and detailed for
about 2,000 years. With beeswax
acting as a sealant, moisture and
other deteriorating factors didn't
affect the art pieces. Hypothetical-
ly, encaustic paintings could last,
unchanging, for hundreds of thou-
sands of years.
Still, no matter how many years
encaustic paintings can with-
stand, the medium proved to have
no defense against the whims of
human preference.After the Fayum
portraits, encaustic fell out of artis-
tic favor until the 1950s, when it
enjoyed a gradual rebirth under
Jasper Johns, the father of contem-
porary encaustic painting. Slowly
regaining its popularity, encaustic
is still an obscure art form, but it's
not forgotten.
Two of Steif's most recent
encaustic series - the Knot Series
and the Wire Series - explore sev-
eral of her artistic themes of mar-
ginality. Both series grew out of
her interpretations of the "knot
theory," which she explains is the
theory that, mathematically, some
knots cannot be undone.
"I don't know how I stumbled
across this piece of arcane knowl-
edge," Steif said. "I am not a math
person - but it really appealed to

idea of knotsof boundaries."
Steif cites, among others, L

Series technically is."
The Knot Series, at first glance,
looks like brightly colored wax has
been poured over knotted yarn. But
that's not the case. After carefully

then painstakingly built up layers
of wax to create an encaustic repre-

Knot Series. Steif explains that

THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND 'BROTHERS AND SISTERS' (1973)
The Brothers forge on

FIRE POI

land eventually made it to the
United States and gained popular-
ity as a staple means of expression
in rave culture. Over time poi in
the United States developed into
a complex art with multiple styles
and techniques. Performances are
often paired with costumes and
music, and performers travel all
over the world to attend festivals
and competitions.
The most skilled artists and

performers treat the poi as simply
an extension of their bodies, never
losing track of exactly where the
flames are and how the fire can
be manipulated. I, for one, am not
an artist. My moves are limited to
just a few tricks: It takes me a long
time to get comfortable with the
weight of the fire poi (my practice
pair is much lighter) and I'm still
much more tense than I should be
when I perform. Unfortunately, my
learning progress has slowed con-
siderably with the obligations of
academia.
Still, poi is there when I need to
forget about class or blow off some

steam. Diverting myself from the
complexities of the world with an
exercise involving just me and the
flame - or maybe even life and
death, if you're dramatic - great-
ly lessens the significance of my
day-to-day tribulations. Maybe I'll
eventually get to the level of talent
I aspire to reach. Until then, I'll
enjoy the unique adrenaline rush
you can't get anywhere else. My
stumbling across this performance
art was a fantastic accident that
happened in the most unexpected
of places. Intriguing, obscure art
exists everywhere in many forms
- it just won't always involve fire.

When our favorite bands lose
core members, it's more often than
not a very bad thing. WhileWilco
seems to be doing fine without Jay
Bennett, such happily-ever-after
cases are far from the norm. Guns
N' Roses pretty much collapsed
after Izzy Stradlinleftthe group in
late 1991, and when John Bonham
choked to death on his own vomit,
Led Zeppelin, the oft-cited great-
est rock'n'roll band of all time,
didn't even make an attempt to
carry on. The group - along with
the dreams of Zoso-inked fanboys
everywhere - simply crumbled.
But when Duane Allman was
fatally crushed in a motorcycle
accident in 1971, the Allman
Brothers Band brazenly went on
making music. Luckily, the band
had a slew of material left over
from when Duane was still alive,
and they turned this into the now-
classicEatA Peach.
But what really makes the All-
man Brothers bad-ass in a way
that Guns N' Roses and Led Zep-
pelin never were is that they didn't
stop making relevant, era-defining
albums after the death of a core
member. Wait, scratch that. Two
core members. Bassist Berry Oak-
ley died in an eerily similar fash-
ion (a motorcycle accident just
blocks away from Duane's) less
than a year later. That, folks, is a
little something called resilience.
Brothers and Sisters, the first
Allman Brothers' album that
Duane or Oakley had nothing to
do with, embodies this element
of the band's awesomeness more
than any other release in its cata-
log. Despite losing one of the
greatest rock guitarists of all time
