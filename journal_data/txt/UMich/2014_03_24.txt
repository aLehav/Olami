sit-in sees
progress

RUBY WA LLAU/Daily
After eleven years, Donna Rafferty and Jules Cobb are married at Washtenaw County Court Saturday.
Same-sex couples join in
marriage before court stay

Officials issue
marriage licenses
ahead of circuit
court's injunction
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
By 11 a.m. Saturday morn-
ing, Chelsea residents Marcia
Wilson and Kim Richer were
deemed wife and wife. Dressed

in a simple hoodies-and-jeans
ensemble, clutching red roses,
they were officiated in a room
in the lower floor of the Washt-
enaw County Clerk's Office
among other beaming same-sex
couples, children in their Sun-
day best offering stickers and
cookies and families snapping
iPhone picture.
Same-sex couples waited
hours to marry in Washtenaw
County and three other counties
around Michigan, taking part in
an act that had been prohibited

until the same-sex marriage ban
was lifted on Friday.
However, the Wilson-Ritcher
wedding and more than 100 oth-
ers statewide may be at risk as a
result of the stay of proceedings
issued late Saturday by the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati. A stay is a legal action
that suspends a particular pro-
ceeding within a case - same-
sex marriage in this situation.
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette (R) requested an
emergency stay shortly after the

decision was announced Friday
at 5 p.m. Schuette defended the
state's 2004 ban on same-sex
marriage and requested the stay
for the case shortly after the
decision was announced Friday.
The Court of Appeals issued the
stay later Saturday.
The stay will halt ceremonies
until Wednesday. At that point
there will be a hearing concern-
ing Schuette's request.

It was a busy weekend for mem-
bers of Students Allied for Freedom
and Equalityand allthosesittingin
inthe Central Student Government
chambers, as both administrators
and CSG representatives met with
the group to discuss plans to move
forward.
SAFE's efforts over the past
three days culminated with astate-
ment Sunday from Business senior
Michael Proppe, CSG president,
who laid out his response to each
of the five "calls for accountability"
from the sit-in, including an apol-

ogy fromProppe personally.
The sit-in in the CSG cham-
bers in the Michigan Union began
Wednesday night in response to
CSG's indefinite postponement on
a vote to divest from companies
thathave supported allegedhuman
rights violations against Palestin-
ians. While the larger goal of the
movement is to use CSG's influence
to call on the University to divest
from these companies, the sit-in is
auresponse to CSG's indefinite post-
ponement of avote onthe proposal.
Proppe, Public Policy junior
Bobby Dishell, CSG vice president,
and LSA sophomore Meagan Sho-
kar, CSG speaker of the assembly,
met with the participants of the sit-
in Sunday afternoon to give a state-
ment from Proppe and discuss the
current on-campus situation.In the
statement, Proppe responded to all
five of the calls for accountability
made, reiterating his plan from last
week to motion for Assembly Reso-
lution 3-050 to be reconsidered.

CAMPUS LIFE
MUSIC Matters
will host 2 Chainz
at SpringFest

Proceeds from
events will go
toward scholarship,
leadership camp
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
After months of negotiations
and contract edits, MUSIC
Matters has finally chained
down the headlining artist for
its year-end concert. This guy
is different - yeah, he's differ-
ent. And he's ready to perform.
2 Chainz will grace the Hill
Auditorium stage April 10 to
close MUSIC Matters' capstone
event, SpringFest.
Engineering senior Shan-
kara Bharadwaj, the chair of
MUSIC Matters' Talent and
Concert Committee, said he
thinks 2 Chainz is at the peak
of his career, which makes him
a hot acquisition as a musical
guest.
"Three Grammy nomina-
tions, invited to all the major
summer festivals ... there's a

reason why we worked so hard
to get him here," Bharadwaj
said. "He brings a lot of energy;
the Michigan student body is
known to have a lot of energy.
So it should be a marriage,
really."
Business senior Phil Scherm-
er, MUSIC Matters President,
said hiring 2 Chainz is the
icing on the cake that has been
expanding this year's Spring-
Fest into an all-encompassing
showcase of student achieve-
ment.
This year, the organization
is rethinking SpringFest to
resemble South by Southwest,
the 10-day spring festival in
Austin that is a hub for music,
film and technology.
"What we're doing in the
afternoon at SpringFest is
going to be so big," he said. "It's
not going to be like anything
anyone has seen on campus
before."
The revamped event will
stretch from the Diag to North
University Avenue. Its tentative
layout will include a central
"globe," an open area and stage

Doctors-to-be reveal
their placements
across the country
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
Anxiety was palpable in the
Building 18 ballroom of the
North Campus Research Com-
plex Friday at noon. After years
of studying, 161 future doc-
tors would soon receive their
residency assignments--the

culmination of their medical
evaluation.
Match Day, the annual day on
which every medical student in
the country learns where he or
she is placed for residency took
place Friday. At noon, Medi-
cal School seniors opened their
envelopes and went on stage to
declare where they would go.
Throughout their senior
year, Medical School students
interview at hospitals around
the country. The students rank
their preferences of hospitals
and the hospital chooses which

students it wants to accept as
residents. The preferences of
each side go into a computer
program, which attempts to
create ideal matches. At the end
of the process students receive
an envelope, unaware of which
residency acceptance it will
contain.
The room was packed with
long tables of food, maize and
blue balloons, hundreds of
glasses of sparkling water and
the friends and families of the
future residents. Many students

A group of University secretar-
ies began efforts to organize the
University's clerical staff of 3,000-
plus into a union.
The group, which called itself
the Concerned Clericals for Action
and was 35 members strong at the
time, named the lack of represen-
tation at the University as chief
among its concerns. Other issues
included low wages and a lack of
job security, CCFA member Vicki
Connell told the Daily.
"We have no power in this Uni-
versity," Connell said. "In all the
boards, committees, and commis-
sions, no one represents the secre-
taries."

The University responded to the
Supreme Court's announcement
that it would heara lawsuit filed by
a student who was dismissed from
the University after failing the first
part of the National Board of Medi-
cal Examinations.
The student, Scott Ewing,
recorded the lowest score ever
received by a Michigan student on
the exam. He was then discharged
from Inteflex, the Medical School's
accelerated program. His attorneys
argued that because he was the
only student who wasn't allowed
to retake the test after failing it, the
University's decision to dismiss him
was "arbitrary and capricious."

The University of Michigan
Health System refused to turn
over any records in relation to a
U.S. Department of Justice sub-
poena of obstetrician Timothy
Johnson's abortion records.
Johnson, along with seven
other obstetricians, was part of
a federal lawsuit challenging the
constitutionality of a 2003 par-
tial birth abortion ban.
The Department of Justice
stated that it needed the records
in order to ascertain whether
Johnson had performed any par-
tial birth abortions.

Candidates aim to improve
campus diversity climate

Party Party promises humor,
student involvement in CSG

Defend Affirmative
Action party aims
to increase minority
student population
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In the upcoming Central
Student Government election,
one party is looking to com-
pletely redefine the role of stu-
dent representation.
The Defend Affirmative
Action Party's members believe
that CSG should be more than
just a liaison between stu-
dents and the administration.
LSA sophomore Mical Holt,
the presidential candidate for
DAAP, said student govern-
ment should be a more mobile
and active force in effecting
change on campus.
Holt will run alongside LSA
-Hm

freshman Taylor Jones, DAAP's
vice presidential candidate.
"DAAP aims to make Central
Student Government an active
voice and dynamic organizing
center against racism, sexism,
and for equal, quality public
education for all in order to
make the University a more
inclusive one," Holt said.
To achieve this, their party
platform aims to improve
numerous mechanisms of
equality. These include restor-
ing affirmative action at the
University; doubling Black,
Latino and Native American
student enrollment; and elimi-
nating the SAT and ACT from
the admissions process.
Holt said all of these initia-
tives will help to create a "more
holistic approach" that coun-
teracts "biased and discrimi-
natory" elements of college
admissions.
Holt added that an increase
in on-site admissions would
H-m

be a monumental first step in
the greater approach. He said
another means of increasing
the presence of underrepre-
sented groups would be one
instituted by the University of
Texas, where the top 10 per-
cent of students from each high
school in the state are accepted.
LSA sophomore William
Marshall III, who is running
to be a DAAP representative
in the CSG Assembly, said it is
also important for the Univer-
sity to consider race in the con-
text of socioeconomic status in
the admissions process.
"It's very likely that for
minority students especially,
possibly when looking at race,
some admissions officers may
or may not be more inclined
either way to make a decision,"
he said. "But when taking race
into consideration, it could be
possible to say, 'Oh, these stu-
dents are African-American
and they are from a poor area,
so maybe their school system
was not as good as their white
counterpart schools.
Detroit resident Joseph
Semana is a member of the
Coalition to Defend Affirma-
tive Action, Integration and
Immigrant Rights and Fight for
Equality By Any Means Neces-
sary - the parent organization
of DAAP - and is helping those
on the DAAP slate campaign.
Semana said the local BAMN
chapter received CSG fund-
ing earlier this year so that
students could attend the first
oral arguments of the Supreme
Court case debating the consti-
tutionality of Michigan's affir-
mative action ban on Oct. 15.
He said a decision on the case
is expected within the next few
months.
"When Mical is elected or
DAAP people are elected to
Central Student Government,
whatever the resources that we
can use from there to help gal-
vanize-people around this case

Newly formed
political party forms
in hopes of winning
upcoming election
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
The Party Party is all about
bringing fun and involvement
to Central Student Government,
but it wants voters to know they
are no joke. LSA junior Ryan
Hayes, the party's CSG presi-
dential candidate, and Business
junior Brennan Woods, vice
presidential candidate, are hop-
ing to bring a fresh perspective
to the CSG race.
Hayes said he and Woods
were motivated to found The
Party Party due to their distaste
for the mainstream campaigns
of recent years.
"Every year, it's a new
rebranding of a new pun with
Michigan," Hayes said. "We felt
that it was a Groundhog Day of a
continual cycle of the same can-
didates."
TPP is built on the goal of
increasing student engagement
as less than 15 percent of Uni-
versity students voted in CSG
elections each year.
"For a school like Michigan,
to have that lack of engagement
from a central student govern-
ment, that's a disgrace," Hayes
said. "It's a student body voice
and right now it's a whisper."
While The Party Party does
not have any candidates run-
ning for CSG representative
positions, its team includes
a group of 13 students titled
the "Extraordinary League of
Advisors" on the party's web-
site, umpartyparty.com. These
students have titles such as
"Bar and Fitness Expert" and
"Tommy Bahama Rep."
Engineering junior Erik
Winnega, designated the "Whiz
Kid" in charge of campaign
management, said Hayes and
Woods would be more transpar-

ent leaders.
"The only contact I have with
student government isan e-mail
every three months from the
president and that goes straight
to my trash," Winnega said. "If
they get into office, that's going
to change."
The Party Party platform,
referred to as their "Elevated
Surface," names engagement,
empowerment and expectations
as their beliefs.
Hayes said the mission of
TPP is much less specific than
those of other parties that are
running. He said listing indi-
vidual goals of candidates is a
contradiction of listening to the
voice of the student body.
"By saying, 'This is what
we're going to do,' it's a com-
plete fallacy of the engagement
that you're trying to promise,"
Hayes said.
Hayes and Woods promised
increased engagement by elimi-
nating the official office hours
currently held in CSG cham-
bers. Hayes said he is willing to
meet students where they want
to be met, rather than holding
office hours on the third floor of
the Union.
"That limits the passion of
the students. That dampers
their momentum," Hayes said.
"You need to be more proac-
tive than saying, 'Our doors are
open, come find us."'
Regarding empowerment,
TPP prioritizes increased fund-
ing for student organizations.
Hayes said involvement in
student organizations is how
Michigan students create their
undergraduate experience.
"The connection I feel with
people is not that we go to the
same school, it's that we have
passions and that we approach
those passions through those
organizations," he said.
TPP aims to dedicate the
majority of CSG funds to stu-
dent organizations. For the
Winter 2014 budget, 42 percent
of funds were allocated to stu-
dent organizations. Business
senior Michael Proppe, CSG

president, has also expressed
frustration with these low num-
bers in the past.
The third pillar of TPP's mis-
sion is the reevaluation of the
expectations of CSG. Hayes said
while he agrees with everything
Make Michigan and FORUM
are advocating for, he feels their
platforms are too ambitious to
achieve in a single year. He said
TPP would focus on a few spe-
cific initiatives if elected.
"Expectations that are realis-
tic is not a synonym with being
pessimistic. It's opportunistic,"
he said.
With elections approaching,
Hayes said he and Woods will
devote their energy to stand out
from their opponents.
Hayes said he is looking for-
ward to proving their legiti-
macy at Monday evening's CSG
elections debate, which will be
held at 7:30 p.m. on Monday in
Room 1225 South Hall of the
Law School. Winnega added
that he is confident they will
fare well in the debate against
the major party candidates.
"There have been funny cam-
paigns in the past and there
always will be, but they're not
backed up by anything," Win-
nega said. "(TPP) are going to do
well because people are going to
connect with them."
The Party Party's campaign
in the coming days mostly
involves its members embar-
rassing themselves, Hayes said.
Some of their plans include a
dance to Beyonc6's "Drunk in
Love" on the Diag and a rhyth-
mic gymnastics performance
in the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library.
"We're just going to be as
dynamic as we can," Hayes said.
Winnega said Hayes and
Woods' humorous approach
should not undermine their rep-
utations as effective candidates.
"They don't take themselves
seriously, but what I can say is
they take their work seriously,"
Winnega said. "I don't know
more sincere individuals."

DIVEST
From Page 1A
personally apologizes for the pro-
posal's indefinite postponement,
and the fact that the students
felt silenced with both support-
ers and dissenters being unable
to voice their opinions. He also
apologized for not helping fos-
tering a safe campus climate and
expressed regret to any student
who felt unsafe at the University
because of their identity.
After Proppe read the state-
ment, which at the time had not
yet been made public, #UMDi-
vest organizers and support-
ers offered amendments to the
wording, as they were generally
unhappy with the statement's
tone. Members specifically took
issue with Proppe's explanation
of why CSG representatives were
unavailable to attend "teach-
in" sessions to learn about the
divestment proposal, adding that
Proppe's assertion that mem-
bers didn't have enough time to
attend was not true. They added
that his apology was insufficient,
as it apologized to students who
were made to "feel silenced"
rather than firmly acknowledg-
ing students were silenced.
Despite the criticism of the
statement's wording, members
said the public statement now
online is identical to the one
brought to the sit-in Sunday
afternoon.
"The disappointing thing
isn't even so much that he didn't
address those concerns, it was
that even after we brought them
up and we sat in the room with
him for two hours talking he still
didn't change anything," said
LSA senior Yazan Kherallah, a
SAFE member.
During Sunday's discus-
sion, CSG representatives and
#UMDivest organizers said
they have continued to receive
threats and intimidating mes-
sages through various mediums.
Dishell claimed that he was
accosted by a SAFE member but
did not present the name of the
individual and SAFE leaders
said none of their leadership was
involved in threatening other
individuals and has been proac-
-ive in removing anyne who
would engage in intimidation
tactics.
SAFE members also said their
group members, as well as other
students perceived to be Arab,
have been threatened and intimi-
dated by various individuals on
campus. SAFE members said
the unsafe campus environment
is the result of CSG's decision to
indefinitely postpone a vote on
the resolution and added that it is
CSG's responsibility to not con-
tribute to a hateful climate.
Administrators visited the
#UMDivest sit-in twice on Fri-
day and once on Saturday night.
Dean of Students Laura Blake
Jones also spoke privately with

the largest Jewish organization
on campus.

how the decision comes out,"
Semana said.
Marshall added that the
presence of DAAP represen-
tatives - and, potentially, a
DAAP executive - on the CSG
Student Assembly could - if
the Supreme Court overturns
Michigan's affirmative action
legislation - help the Univer-
sity adopt the policies of a new
affirmative action bill.
Just as important in this
hypothetical situation, Mar-
shall said, would be guiding
the University to enact the
new policies "in a way that
effectively increases minority
enrollment and also increases
the treatment and well-being
of minority students."
"It's just one thing to get
more minority students
enrolled," he said. "But it's
another thing to actually try
to retain them, help take care
of them and make sure they
feel comfortable on a campus
which has, in the past, showed
quite a lot of tension toward
students of minority back-

students' questions in the after-
noon about what the adminis-
tration can do for SAFE, what
influence it has over CSG and
how much flexibility is avail-
able for the sit-in to remain in
the Union overnight. Students
repeatedly stressed that their
calls for accountability are rea-
sonable, adding that their move-
ment has been non-violent but
has not been treated as such, and
that they feel disrespected and
silenced. Students occupying the
CSG chambers have engaged in
limited acts of civil disobedience
by staying in the room after the
Union was scheduled to close at
2 a.m., leading to confrontations
between the group and Univer-
sity Police. No sit-in participant
has been arrested.
Additionally, SAFE represen-
tatives and other members of the
sit-in claimed the administration
has acted with bias throughout
this process, and representatives
asked for a public statement to
be issued regarding the sit-in
the same way the University has
commented in the past with the
SAFE's mock eviction in Decem-
ber.
Harper returned Friday night
with Blake Jones to reach an
agreement with #UMDivest sup-
porters to draft a statement in
support of campus safety.
"I have been enormously
impressed with the thoughtful-
ness, the clarity of thought, how
respectful the students have
been," Harper said. "(I have) just
been a little surprised that peo-
ple have been talking about this
as a violent movement; it's just
not the case. It has been just what
you would expect from smart U
of M students that are passionate
about an important issue."
Harper stressed the impor-
tance of students' collective right
to question the University's val-
ues and added that this ability is
contingent upon both adminis-
trative transparency and agener-
ally safe atmosphere.
She said the divestment move-
ment is not new, adding that
"there is nothing odd going on."
Rather, there has been a tangible
history on campus of students
asking the University about
where it spends its money.
Harper and Blake Jones plan
to draft a statement for the
administration. Harper said it
will address concerns about the
climate and clarify that the Uni-
versity is no place for threats
from either side of this issue.
"The climate issues have
impacted a wide range of groups
of our students this week," Blake
Jones said. "Many people have
been harmed and have felt fear-
ful, and we have to address the
climate issues and care about the
concerns of all of our students."
Harper said the statement
will also draw attention to avail-
able University resources that
can help students combat feel-
ings of insecurity and fear, such
as Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Department of
Public Safety.
As for letting students stay in
the Union, Harper told them it
is "not in your best interests to
get arrested." While students
grounds."
Holt also addressed the
recent #BBUM and #UMDi-

vest movements on campus as
examples in which the Univer-
sity has failed to fully recog-
nize or fix the problems of its
diverse constituency of stu-
dents - a problem which he,
as CSG president, would seek
to solve.
He said DAAP strives to give
a voice back to students who
feel marginalized or disen-
franchised.
"This idea of 'business as
usual' through the University
has been intimidating or out-
right ignoring the issues of
many people on campus," Holt
said. "Our platform is defying
the business as usual."
Semana said Monday night's
presidential debate will serve
as an open invitation not just
to vote for a political party, but
to joina tangible movement for
change. This is something that
was also discussed at a DAAP-
hosted tribunal last Thursday,
Marshall added.
"I want the student body to
become cognizant of the fact
that there is a hostile environ-
ment on campus, and to address
this issue we must first become

noted that previous sit-ins at the
University have been allowed to
continue without interruption,
Harper said the policies have
since changed, and students need
to be cleared from the building at
night for safety reasons.
Thus far, the sit-in partici-
pants have left every night at
about 2 a.m. when the building
closes, but have returned to the
chambers the next morning.
Blake Jones and Harper met
again with SAFE and the rest of
the sit-in's participants on Sat-
urday night to facilitate a simi-
lar discussion, but details of that
meeting remain private.
Blake Jones spoke to students
at Hillel Friday afternoon about
how the failure of the resolu-
tion to reach a vote in CSG has
contributed to an increasingly
charged campus climate.
She spoke privately with stu-
dent leaders of Hillel about per-
sonal concerns before answering
questions from all students who
attended the forum. The meet-
ing with Blake Jones was open
to all students who wanted to
express their concerns to the
University administration about
the sensitive climate on campus
surrounding the Israeli-Palestin-
ian conflict and the #UMDivest
movement. Another purpose of
the meeting was to clarify the
details of what occurred at the
student government meeting
for those looking to know more
about the issue.
"I was here today to listen and
to hear from students," Blake
Jones said. "I've been doing that
all week. I was happy to be able
to be here today."
Blake Jones stayed for about
20 minutes, and the rest of the
meeting was devoted to open dis-
cussion about how students felt
about the topic. After the meet-
ing, many students expressed
feelings of frustration, as well as
apprehension regarding threats
some Jewish students had been
receiving.
"I think that obviously there's
a lot of passions on both sides,"
said LSA senior Jonathan Aseel,
who attended the meeting. "Peo-
ple need to just remember to
focus on mutual respect and give
each other the opportunity to
present their own opinions and
perspectives."
Dishell attended the meeting
with Shokar, his Make Michigan
running mate.
"There was a lot of great con-
versation about how there's not
just one narrative and not every-
one needs to sit down together to
discuss the issue," Dihell said.
"I was very proud of the com-
munity that kept saying how it's
important that we don't just talk
about Israel on campus but that
we talk about everything that's
going on and the entire issue."
Throughout the process,
administrators have been careful
to note their role only as facili-
tators of conversation and the
fact that the University cannot
force CSG to take any specific
action. Proppe said he plans to
motion Tuesday for the proposal
to be considered again, but no
other separate meeting has been
scheduled.

"We're serious about it. I'd like
to just ask the students to join

Investing in the environment
The University should consider proposal to divest from fossil fuels
Jn a presentation to the University's Board of Regents Thursday, the Law
Students for Responsible Divestment from FossilFuelsurged the regents
to reduce the amount of the University's endowment that's invested in
the fossil fuel industry. Specifically, LSRD is calling for a divestment from
"coal and oil equity and debt instruments," which it estimates represent one
percent of the University's total endowment. The organization claims that
the University's investments in the fossil fuel industry are antithetical to its
stated core value of sustainability. Since fossil fuels are one of the primary
causes climate change, the industry shouldn't be supported by the University's
investments. LSRD has campaigned for divestment from fossil fuels in the
past without action from the University. Since the group has proposed a new,
viable plan for divestment, the University should seriously consider the plan
in order to bring its endowment investments more in line with its core values.

According to the Divest and Invest
Campaign, about $1.04 billion of the $9.16
billion University endowment was categorized
as fossil fuel investments in June 2012. LSRD's
proposal indicatesthat divesting only from coal
and oil equities wouldn't have any noticeable
effect on the endowment's volatility. The plan
provides a gradual and reasonable way for the
University to reduce its financial support of an
environmentally detrimental industry.
The University's mission statement states
that the school is dedicated to sustainability.
In accordance with this statement, University
President Mary Sue Coleman began an
initiative in September 2011 for the investment
of $14 million in environmental sustainability
projects, which has materialized in the form
of new hybrid cars, buses and solar panel
fields. The Program in the Environment major,
sustainability minor and the Planet Blue
campaign further not just the University's
commitment to sustainable practices, but
emphasizes the importance of environmental
responsibility to students as well. Continued
investment in fossil fuels is in direct conflict

with this mission statement as well as the
academic and social work that many University
students are committed to.
In the past, the University has
divested from industries deemed socially
irresponsible and in conflict with its core
values. The University divested from the
tobacco industry in 2000 and South African
firms during the country's apartheid era. The
divestment from tobacco represented less
than 0.8 percent of the endowment at the
time, according to LSRD, making the current
proposed divestment similar in scope. Just as
apartheid and tobacco meet the qualifications
for divestment consideration, today's current
issue of climate change also warrants
appropriate action by the regents. Climate
change is one of the most pressing issues of
our generation. The University has been at
the forefront of promoting environmental
responsibility in many respects, but its
endowment investments have not followed
this trend. It's time for the regents to seriously
consider the proposal put forth by LSRD and
divest from fossil fuels.

Divestment is not the solution

ALEXANDER LANE|I
Pursuing attainable goals

Last Tuesday representatives of Central
Student Government once again decided to
wade into the murky waters of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. The issue this time? A
resolution calling for University divestment
from companies whose business activities
in Israeli-occupied territories are allegedly
violating Palestinian human rights. Much
chaos and resentment ensued - acrimonythat
was entirely avoidable, entirely unnecessary
and sadly, entirely predictable.
Why so? Let's step back, breathe a bit and
return to reality. Most glaringly - and this may
come as a surprise to some representatives'
egos, so my apologies ahead of time for any
bruising inflicted - I am quite sure that CSG
does not have jurisdiction over Jerusalem or
any other part of the Middle East. I know for
a fact they don't have jurisdiction over my
apartment three blocks off campus, because
I still own a SodaStream, despite Oxfam and
Scarlett Johannson.
#UMDivest will not solve what 65 years of
U.N. Security Council resolutions have failed
to do. It will not move the needle more than
a fraction towards peace. It certainly will
not represent the undivided viewpoint of
the student body that this is the right thing
to do - which is quite unlike the two other
instances where the University did divest: in
South Africa toward the end of apartheid and
from the tobacco industry in the early 2000s.
Which leaves me to question what, really, is
the point? I very much admire the aim of Stu-
dents Allied for Freedom and Equality, the
campaign's main sponsor, but its means - as
demonstrated in the incendiary and classless
insults I've seen its members lob at CSG reps
on Facebook, as well as the none-too-subtle
way they staged evictions #UMMockEviction
last December - leave me with little hope that
they're the sort of leaders who will grow up
to bring peace to Palestine. All heat, no light.
Still,tobe fair, it'sthe job ofgroups like SAFE
to advocate their interests and maybe stir up
some controversy. After all, it brings attention
to their issue. So I redirect this writing, and
my fire, to CSG, whose job is expressly not to
become so political.
I fear the Margaret Mead-ification of
campuses like Ann Arbor's - Save the Earth!
Heal the planet! - has burrowed too far into
students' heads. Changing the world is not
an entry-level task. It takes time, work and
resources far beyond what anyone will have in
college. That's not to say it's not possible, but in
our impatient modern lives, we seem to want to
0 ,

have that influence immediately and just skip
all the incremental steps along the way. You
know, the unsexy parts.
IfCSG had hadthe fortitudeto resistopening
Pandora's box, they'd have realized how
many of those unsexy parts are nevertheless
meaningful campus improvements that they
mightstill make this year. Here's a list I thought
of in thirty seconds: Make MWireless available
on the busses; install more bike racks (or
longboarding slots!); ensure that every student
has access to fresh, healthy food on campus;
increase student fanship at sports that aren't
basketball, football or hockey; catch up to the
rest of the Big Ten schools by putting a student
on the Board of Regents. Not socially conscious
enough for you? Then how about continuing
to address the shameful lack of minority
representation at the University, particularly
among Black males. All of these things are
possible by the direct action of CSG.
Put another way, one thing I really admire
about the outgoing administration is how
understated and focused its goals have been.
Creating the Night Owl bus service didn't
change the world and neither did makingMujo's
a 24-hour cafe, but they weren't designed to.
What they did do is improve life on campus
- which is worth something. CSG President
Michael Proppe set reasonable, accomplishable
goals and he followed through. The Student
Assembly might learn a thing from that.
Due to the fact that on Tuesday all they
wanted to do was save the world, they spent
hours debating international relations, when
instead they might have helped the student
body. Every minute they spent on the Middle
East was a minute not spent on addressing
problems they could actually solve. They
apparently forgot that their election to CSG
did not mean their election to the Knesset,
or the PNA, or the United Nations - or the
Model United Nations, for that matter. What
it did mean was their responsibility to serve
the students of the University. It meant
focusing on ways to improve campus. It
meant practicing the art of the possible and
having the wisdom to know the difference.
That wisdom seems sorely lacking these
days. There are monumental things CSG might
accomplish, if only they knew where tolook. So
to all students, as you go to vote this week for a
new round of leaders, ask of those to whom you
are entrusting this campus: Where is your focus
- Ann Arbor or somewhere else?
Alexander Lane is a 2013 University alum.

The argument against the
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
movement is simple. BDS is based
on two flawed principles: it calls
for divestment from companies
associated with Israel on the
basis of human rights violations,
and portrays Palestinians as an
oppressed minority under Israel.
Facts and history have proven these
claims false, yet BDS continues
to gain support by presenting its
mission under inaccurate premises.
First, to divest from Israel
on the basis of human rights is
unprecedented. Israel's human
rights record is incomparable
to that of other Middle Eastern
countries. In Syria, the Assad
regime has slaughtered 140,000
people; in Saudi Arabia, oppression
of women is rampant; governments
in Egypt and Iran have executed
hundreds of civilians. In contrast,
Israel maintains a standard of
human rights comparable to
Western democracies, even amid
an existential threat that few other
countries face.
Moreover, it is a misrepresentation
to portray Palestinians as
marginalized victims. In 1937, 1947,
1967, 1979, 2000 and 2008 - on six
occasions - Palestinians rejected
offers for a Palestinian state
alongside Israel. The humiliation
of 1948 and 1967 has stayed with
Palestinian leadership, and tensions
only rise when new peace offers are
lessdesirablethanthepreviousones.
As a result, Palestinian leadership
often focuses on resistance: in Gaza,
Hamas sponsors terrorism against
Israel, while West Bank leaders
condemn Israeli policies and offers. A
more effective leadership would turn
its attention to its own citizens and
improvetheirinfrastructure,economy
and living conditions. However,
instead of pressuring its leadership to
take initiative, BDS continues to claim
victim status and blame Israel, and
neither of these approaches improves
Palestinians' situation.
So how could a flawed movement
attract such a large showing

at the recent Central Student
Government meeting? Through
misrepresentation. Under the
banner of "human and minority
rights" and "freedom," the BDS
movement attracts people in two
categories. In the first are students
who participate because they
believe the cause is humanitarian.
But how will BDS improve the lives
of Palestinians? Will it help them
build schools and hospitals, bring
them food and water or improve
their living conditions? Will it
hold their government accountable
for its failings and propel their
people toward democracy? It
won't. Moreover, BDS would be
detrimental to Palestiniansw who
benefit from certain relations
with Israel. For example, Israel
has provided medical technology
and rehabilitation to civilians,
food shipments to Gaza and
allows thousands of West Bank
Palestinians to work in Israel.
Movements that shout "Divest!"
are not solving the problems that
the Palestinian government has
prolonged, and even Israel has
reached out to Palestinians in more
effective ways.
The second, larger group of BDS
supporters are Palestinians whose
families and relatives have suffered
in the conflict. Pain and sadness
accompany their stories, and BDS
is one of their only ways to resist
the complex reality of 1948 and
1967 which resulted in lost homes
and land. However, divestment
from Israel will not provide a right
of return for their families, or
address past wrongs. This matter
was brought before CSG, not
the United Nations. Palestinian
students' raw, emotional stories
cannot be resolved by divestment
from a few companies. They are
decades-old problems with which
the international community has
grappled for years, and a vote for
the BDS resolution will not bring us
closer to solving them.
When emotion and frustration
are not used for positive

change, they drive hatred and
delegitimization. Students latch
onto this form of resistance to drive
a barrier between college campuses
and Israel. BDS may appear to be for
divestment from a few companies,
but similar efforts nationwide
have led to boycotts which hinder
academic freedom and valuable
partnerships in science, technology
and other fields. BDS reinforces
a flawed portrait of Israel,
overwriting Israel's commitment to
democracy and human rights with
false accusations.
BDS receives attention by
misrepresentation: if its supporters
were concerned with human rights,
they would discuss divestment
from Syria or Saudi Arabia, not
Israel. If they wanted lasting
improvement for Palestinians,
they could focus on improving
conditions in the territories. Obada
Shtaya, a Palestinian speaker from
the grassroots peace movement
OneVoice, explained his hope that
young, empowered Palestinians will
petition their own government for
democracy. His comments showed
young Palestinians have power
to stand up for positive change.
Similarly, I would encourage
SAFE to put its own people first by
improving Palestinian lives and
creating the potential for a lasting
solution. Until then, CSG cannot let
itself be moved by mob displays of
emotion and false accusations.
With its recent decision to table
the BDS resolution indefinitely,
CSG showed that BDS is not an
issue for the Michigan student
body to decide. I want to thank its
members for remaining impartial,
and encourage them to continue
to be firm in the face of large
crowds and emotional rhetoric.
My hope is that the discussion on
the conflict can move forward in a
productive way - something that
can only happen when hatred and
misrepresentation, fostered by
BDS, are abandoned.

Same-sex couples marry in court Saturday

MARRIAGE
From Page 1A
ary 2012. Federal Judge Bernard
Friedman ruled Friday against
the 2004 voter-passed Michi-
gan Marriage Act, writing it was
unconstitutional since it did not
protect gays and lesbians equally
under the law.
Hazel Park's Jayne Rowse, a
plaintiff in the case, said on Friday
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily that she was surprised
there was no stay. She and her
partner, Hazel Park resident April
DeBoer, originally sued the state
so they could jointly adopt their
three special-needs children.
Twelve-year-old Aliza Break-
ey-Ways, wearing a dress pur-
chased that morning for her
fathers' wedding, is one child who
will be protected by the ruling.
Her fathers, Ann Arbor residents
Joe Breakeyand Peter Ways, mar-
ried on Saturday during what they
said was an amazing day that will
promise their child legal rights.
Breakey-Ways said she was
excited to share the news of
her fathers' marriage with her
friends.

"I mean, it's in the Constitution
that everyone's equal and that law
has been being broken for the last
how ever many years," Breakey-
Ways said. "And finally justice is
here."
Ann Arbor Township residents
Jennifer Gould and Gina Torielli,
who were waiting for their mar-
riage licenses on Saturday, said
the added protection from state
recognition.
"We feel validated," Torielli
said. "We've always felt married
to each other, but it's nice to have
the state recognize it too."
"We feel safer," Gould added.
"We can actually protect each
other, financially, health wise."
Statewide, before the stay went
into effect Saturday night, more
than 100 couples wedded and
more than 300 obtained marriage
licenses. Washtenaw County
alone welcomed 74 new same-sex
couples, while officials in Ingham,
Muskegon and Oakland counties
also processed marriage licenses.
The possibility of a stay led
these countries to open their
offices on Saturday, Washtenaw
County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum
(D) said. He said ensuring the
extra resources, such as dedi-
cating overtime pay to city per-

sonnel, to open the clerk's office
from 9 a.m. to1 p.m. was wise and
indicative of the support of the
ban's lift.
"It went from being a question
of, 'Could we do it?' to 'How could
we not?"' he said.
Manyofthe couples who packed
the Washtenaw County Clerk's
Office on Saturday said they chose
to get married that day because of
the possibility of the stay.
However, the stay may render
some of these nuptials legally
ambiguous, Carl Tobias, a profes-
sor at the University of Richmond
School of Law, told The Detroit
Free Press on Saturday. These
marriages may be recognized by
the federal government, but not
by the state.
In December, a federal judge
ruled in favor of same-sex mar-
riage in Utah. However, a stay was
issued in that state in January as
the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals
considers the case.
Friction between state and
federal rulings are also epito-
mized in California. The Golden
State's supreme court deemed the
state's ban was unconstitutional
in June 2008, but issuance of
same-sex marriage licenses was
barred after voters elected to ban

same-sex marriage in Nov. 2008.
The marriages occurring before
November were legal, however. A
June 2013 Supreme Court ruling
overturned this ban, and same-
sex couples in California can now
seek marriage.
Schuette's spokeswoman Joy
Yearout did not comment to the
Free Press regarding whether or
not Schuette believes the week-
end's same-sex marriages should
receive recognition from the state
as appeals go through the courts.
On Friday, in an earlier inter-
view with the Daily following the
ban's initial overturning, State
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor)
said Friedman's ruling would
likely stay.
"Regardless of whether or not
we can get a stay or an appeal
from the (Court of Appeals for
the) Sixth Circuit, anyone who
has read the Supreme Court rul-
ing on DOMA needs to come to
the conclusion that this case is
a loser for Bill Schuette," Irwin
said.
Early Saturday, Kestenbaum said
he doubts that the stay will have far-
reaching effects. He said the politi-
cal leanings of the Sixth Circuit
coupled with the Supreme Court's
ruling on the Defense of Marriage

Act renders it unlikely that the fed-
eral court will uphold the 2004 ban
on same-sex marriage.
Kestenbaum added it may be
likely that conservative coun-
ties such as small, rural com-
munities in Western Michigan
would be slow to allow same-sex
couples to marry. He said county
clerks' offices throughout the
state should have an influx akin
to Washtenaw County's on Mon-
day morning, if the emergency
injunction had not succeeded.
This would result in a lawsuit for
such counties.
Hundreds of Washtenaw
County residents awaited the
office's 9 a.m. opening and packed
its lower and first floors. Couples
swarmed the lobby as they waited
to file their paperwork and obtain
a marriage license. Occasionally,
above the din of excited chatter,
cheers filled the room to congrat-
ulate a newly licensed couple.
The frenzied mood tracked
down the stairs into the lower
level, where more than a dozen
officiates offered religious and
non-religious ceremonies.
Reverend Curt DeMars-John-
son, an Okemos resident who
officiated same-sex ceremonies
in the 1990s, said the energy in

the clerk's office, among Krispy
Kreme donuts and laughter, was
palpable.
"What I first witnessed when
I was walking into the building is
that there's tremendous joy writ-
ten all over the faces of many,
many, many people walking
out and entering the building,"
DeMars-Johnson, of Webster
United Church of Christ, said.
"This is a long, long awaited-for
moment."
Couples at the clerk's office
emphasized, however, that the
momentum for change in the
LGBT community should not
cease. Gould and Torielli point-
ed out how homosexuality is
grounds for termination at work.
When the two met 28 years ago,
beinggay was recently deemed no
longer a disease.
But on a sunny, early spring
day last weekend, laughter, cheers
and kisses were ubiquitous.
"It feels fantastic. We've been
waiting for a long time for this
day," Wilson said. She smiled and
turned to her newly-deemed wife,
and her decade-long partner.
"What about you, babe?"
"It feels very long overdue,"
Richer said. "It feels like it's about
time."

Margerie Schloff and Ruth Addis hold hands during their marriage ceremony at Washtenaw County Court Saturday.

RESIDENCIES
From Page 1A
chose to participate in the Uni-
versity's tradition of surprise, and
they opened their envelopes for
the first time while on stage. They
each took a moment to absorb the
information before announcingthe
result to the cheering crowd.
Medical School student Fields
Mead was one of the many stu-
dents accepted to their top-choice
programs. For many this choice
was the University's Hospital Sys-
tem, and 28 percent of this year's
graduating class will return to the
University for residency. Rajesh
Mangrulkar, M.D., associate dean
for medical school education, said
this is likely because the students
have developed bonds with their
superiors.
"When you train here, you get to
know the people in residency here
and so you mightcestablish relation-
ships," Mangrulkar said. "Our resi-
dency programs get to know our
students more than they would get
to know students from across the
country."
When she discovered she would
be undertaking her residency at the
University, Medical School student
Jennifer Taylor shed tears of joy.
Taylor said she could not imagine
being placed anywhere else.
"I interviewed around and Ijust
couldn't find anywhere better,"
Taylor said. "I thought a long time
about, 'Should I go somewhere
else?' But when you fallin love with
a place, you just can't denythat."
While more than a quarter of
the students chose the University,
the other 72 percent will journey
to other institutions throughout
the country. Many students will
attend residency at schools includ-
ing Cornell University, Brown Uni-
versity, Stanford University, Duke
University and Northwestern Uni-
versity.After revealingtheir future
programs, students were invited
to puta pin on a map of the United
States to mark where they would
go. While the greatest collection
of pins was near Ann Arbor, there
were also large numbers placed in
California, Washington, D.C. and
New York.
Medical School stuedent Emily

Naom will leave Ann Arbor to
begin her anesthesiology resi-
dency at Massachusetts General
Hospital - her first choice. After
spending nine years at the Univer-
sity's undergraduate and medical
schools, Naom said she wants to
live in Boston.
"They say that you'll know
places that feel like you'd be a good
match there, and that was the one
for me," Naom said. "I really liked
the program here too, but after nine
years here I thought it would be a
good time to leave and hopefully
come backsome day."
Naom, who studied music as an
undergraduate, chose to become a
doctor afteraninspiringexperience
she had while working at the extra-
corporeal membrane oxygenation
lab in the University's Medical Sci-
ence Research BuildingII.
"I had done the pre-med thing
but I didn't get really involved until
I started working in a lab," Naom
said. "I had a mentor there who
helped me see real-life medicine
as opposed to the big pre-med lec-
tures."
While the vast majority of stu-
dentswere surprised on Match Day,
a number were unruffled. The pro-
grams urology and ophthalmology
have their own match days, which
occur before those of the other
programs. Medical School student
Zachary Koloff, who is studying
urology, went onstage holding a
personalized University jersey,
which, after announcing his resi-
dency would be at the University,
proceeded to put on.
"Our day was not as exciting as
this," Koloff said. "We're just here
for fun."
After every student had pro-
claimed his or her match, Man-
grulkar said he was certain they
would go on to represent the Uni-
versity well.
"Our students come together
so well, and that's the thing we're
proudest about. That value of
them coming together, we've seen
them do that with their patients,"
Mangrulkar said. "About a quar-
ter stay here at University of
Michigan, but three quarters
spread out all over the country.
They carry the block 'M' with
them and that core value."

The aircraft spun
360-degrees before
crashing
SEATTLE (AP) - Surveil-
lance video shows that a Seattle
news helicopter began rotating
at takeoff before it pitched for-
ward into a fiery crash that killed
both men aboard and burned a
third man on the ground, the
National Transportation Safety
Board said late Friday in a pre-
liminary report.
Video culled from three secu-
rity camera recordings near the
crash site shows the aircraft
began rotating counterclockwise
during takeoff Tuesday morning
and rose slightly, nearly level,
from a rooftop helipad, the agen-
cy said. The helicopter contin-
ued rotating counterclockwise
for about 360 degrees before it
pitched forward, nose low.
It "continued the counter-
clockwise rotation in a nose low
attitude until it disappeared
from the camera's field of view,"
the agency said in its one-page
statement.
Available video apparently did
not show the actual crash on a
street next to the Space Needle,
where the KOMO-TV chopper
burst into flames, setting sev-
eral vehicles ablaze and spewing
burning fuel down the street.
Multiple witnesses reported
seeing the helicopter lift off and
begin a counterclockwise rota-
tion, then pitch downward, still
rotating, and crash. They indi-
cated the fire began after the
crash, the NTSB said.
Witnesses earlier told report-
ers they heard unusual noises
coming from the aircraft as it
lifted off from the helipad atop
KOMO's six-story headquarters

after refueling. The initial NTSB
report did not discuss any noises.
The helicopter came to rest
on its right side and "all major
structural components" were
located in the immediate area of
the main wreckage, the NTSB
said. Wreckage debris was found
in a 340-foot radius of the main
wreckage.
The initial report did not
attempt to pinpoint a cause for
the crash. A final report could
take as long as a year, agency offi-
cials have said.
Agency investigators moved
the wreckage to a secure han-
gar in Auburn, south of Seattle,
where they are reconstructing
the helicopter.
The wreck killed both men
on board - pilot Gary Pfitzner,
59, and former KOMO photog-
rapher Bill Strothman, 62. The
two worked for Helicopters Inc.,
of Cahokia, Ill., which owned the
Eurocopter AS350 aircraft.
The agency continues comb-
ing through pilot and mainte-
nance and company records
associated with the flight, the
NTSB's Dennis Hogenson said
earlier. Investigators are focus-
ing on the helicopter's engine,
the airframe, the pilot and the
environment.
A Seattle man in a car, Rich-
ard Newman, 38, was seriously
burned when the helicopter
crashed and caught fire. New-
man underwent surgery Friday
and afterward was reported back
in intensive care in serious con-
dition, a Harborview Medical
Center spokeswoman said. He
suffered burns covering nearly
20 percent of his body, on his
back and arms.
The agency cautioned that
the initial report was prelimi-
nary information and subject to
change.

Woah now.
New 'Muppets' falls

How it feels to have creative control.
Jason Bateman
talks 'Bad Words'

Film and TV star
discusses his
directorial debut in
conference call
By CONRAD FOREMAN
DailyArts Writer
Fans of Jason Bateman
probably know him best as
Michael Bluth, the voice of
reason on "Arrested Devel-
opment" (one of the best TV
shows of all time).
His role on that show is
the good guy, serving as a foil
to his self-centered, some-
times downright evil family.
As he's made the jump to the
big screen, Bateman's roles in,
movies have normally been
similar to the Michael Bluth
character; Perhaps his unde-
niable charm pigeonholes him
as the consummate nice guy.
However, in "Bad Words,"
which releases to theaters
Friday, March 28, Bateman
drastically departs from that
archetype. He plays Guy
Trilby, a crude, disgruntled
40-year-old, who attempts
to win the national spelling
bee - for eighth graders -
through a loophole. Bateman
commented on what it's like
to play a not-so-nice guy dur-
ing a conference call with The
Michigan Daily.
"We're all playing make
believe and the goal is to be
as convincing as possible at
being a bad guy: And that's
kind of fun to do."
Playing the antihero isn't
all that's new for Bateman
in this project, though; "Bad
Words" is his directorial
debut, something he's been
anticipating for a long time.
"I've been basically acting,
mostly for the last fifteen or
twenty years, with the goal
in mind of trying to create
enough capital, enough rel-
evance, enough of a profile
in the business as an actor so
that I can ask for the direct-
ing reigns," Bateman said.

The transition from on-
screen to behind the camera
is one that many actors hope
to make, though sitting on
the director's chair means
intimate involvement in both
pre- and post-production,
and poses difficulties that are
too much for many to handle.
Bateman, however, believes
directing to be a more fulfill-
ing artistic experience.
"With acting, you're trying
to convince people that you're
somebody different, and with
directing you're trying to cre-
ate a completely fake world
for the audience and trying
to shape an experience for
that audience for two hours ...
to me, it's a much more chal-
lenging and gratifying cre-
ative effort," Bateman said. "I
don't want to belittle acting at
all, but maybe it's just because
I've been doing it for so long,
it's so comfortable to me. I
was really excited about the
challenge of taking on more
responsibility."
Though his future career
plans are focused on direct-
ing, acting will still be an
important focus for Bateman.
"If I could rub a genie bot-
tle and get my wish," he says,
"it would probably be some-
thing like what Ben Stiller
does, or George Clooney, or
Ben Affleck, in that they split
their time between the two
and often do both at the same
time."
Bateman refers to his new
film as "a hard 'R,' " though
he points out that the raunchy
content of "Bad Words" serves
a greater purpose, namely, the
chronicling of the low-point
in a man's life, aman who feels
as though he's been trampled
upon by the world and seeks
his own brand of justice.
"There is a very crude, tact-
less, generic, popcorn version
of this kind of humor," Bate-
man said, "And that is not
something I was ever inter-
ested in making."
Bateman believes that,
while the film "gets uncom-
fortable at times, it's not as

bad as some of the violent
films that I think kids flock to
today."
"I think it's tough for kids
to see violence done as well
as Hollywood can do it now-
adays. We can make it look
really convincing that a guy's
head gets blown off his body,
and a lot of kids go in and see
those movies," Bateman said.
He added that he thinks
that nudity and profanity are
much less harmful for chil-
dren than the violent content
rampant in the media.
"Saying a dirty word here or
there, or looking at a woman's
breasts? C'mon. People are
sunbathing without tops on
in Europe and have been for
eons, and that continent's not
pumping out a lot of adoles-
cent murderers left and right.
There's a bit of a prudeness in
this country at times and it's a
little shocking, to at least me."
Bateman also noted that it's
important to have the dark
side of the film - especially
if the laughs are going to be
hearty.
"I knew that with that dark
humor in the script comes the
obligation to counterbalance
that with something a little
bit more sophisticated, a little
bit more human. You've got to
earn those big uncomfortable
comedic moments for people,
otherwise it just feels gratu-
itous or arbitrary. So it asked
me to do a lot as an actor and
as a filmmaker to strike that
balance."
Though darker than audi-
ences might expect to see
Bateman, "Bad Words," will
assuredly provide some
laughs. He especially praised
the comedic talent of the
cast, which includes friends
Kathryn Hahn ("We're the
Millers"), Allison Janney
("American Beauty") and
Rachael Harris ("The Hang-
over").
"I was very, very lucky and
I owe them big. I didn't have
to give them a lot of direction
either, because those guys -
they're Jedi Knights."

By CONRAD FOREMAN
DailyArts Writer
In November 2011, I tooka girl
named Hanna out on our first
date. My combination of love for
movies, fan-
dom of Jason B
Segel and lack
of originality in Muppets
date-planning Most
all pointed to
one activity: Wanted
We were going Rave20and
to see "The
Muppets." Quality16
It's been Disney
over two years
since that first
date, and certainly a lot has
changed over that time. How-
ever, Hanna and I are still going
strong. Naturally, when my edi-
tor said that one of the movies up
for review this week was "Mup-
pets Most Wanted," I knew it
had to be mine -just like I knew
Hanna had to be mine two years
ago.
This sequel to the 2011 Mup-
pets reboot (and eighth install-
ment in the "Muppets" film
franchise) picks up exactly
where its predecessor left off.
With all the Muppets back
together again, Kermit and his
pals are at a loss for how to con-
tinue their revitalized careers.
In steps Dominic Badguy (Ricky
Gervais, "The Invention of
Lying"), who promises that he
can deliver a lucrative world
tour for the gang. They catch a
train to Berlin where Dominic
lives up to his last name, helping
Kermit-lookalike, Constantine,
steal the famous frog's identity.
While the Muppets continue
their world tour, ignorant both
of their leader's absence and the
crimes Dominic and Constan-
tine commit along the way, Ker-
mit (mistakenly believed to be
Constantine) struggles to make
his way in a Russian gulag.
One of the things I love about
Hanna is her ability to make
fun of herself. It's a trait she
shares with the Muppets. From
the opening song that mocks
the poor quality of sequels, to
the police car that takes Ker-
mit away (which reads, "Plot-
pointenburg"), "Muppets Most
Wanted" thrives in its refusal to
take itself seriously.

Of course, no Muppets film
would be complete without a
barrage of cameos. Lady Gaga,
Christoph Waltz, P. Diddy,
Salma Hayek and Usher all make
minor appearances, while the
penitentiary Kermit is sent to
houses prisoners that include
Jemaine Clement, Ray Liotta
and Danny Trejo. Celine Dion
is even featured prominently in
Miss Piggy's musical number.
Aside from Gervais, Tina Fey
("Baby Mama") and Ty Burrell
(TV's "Modern Family") fill the
major human roles. Fey heads
the gulag that imprisons Ker-
mit, but harbors a deep passion
for musical theater. Burrell plays
the detective hot on the trails of
Constantine and Dominic. His
character provides a lot of the
laughs throughout, serving as a
vehicle to mock European cul-
ture (he takes six-hour lunches
and drives a car smaller than
most bicycles, among other ridic-
ulousness).
My personal favorite Mup-
pet, Bunson Honeydew, received
a surprising amount of screen
time. My grandmother, to her
dying day, swore that Honey-
dew is based on the likeness of
my grandfather, a bespectacled
chemist who suffered from alo-
peciaand attended the University
of Michigan with Muppets-cre-
ator Jim Henson.
"Muppets Most Wanted" is
fun enough, but falls short of
the bar set by its predecessor. It
appeals to nostalgia by bringing
back old gags, while still com-
ing off as fresh and original and
providing some genuine laughs

(though not as many as it would
hope). The Muppet style should
also hold a special place in intel-
lectuals' hearts, as it's perhaps
the epitome of postmodernism.
However, for a concept found-
ed on the spreading of positive
moral values, this installment
surprisingly lacks heart. Yes, the
message at the end is that every-
one belongs with their family, but
it feels forced and isn't nearly as
developed as the personal iden-
tity theme in its 2011 forerunner.
It's missing
Segel's sharp
screenwriting.
Perhaps the film fails because
it tries too hard. Jason Segel's
script was much simpler, and his
is probably the best of the eight
Muppets films. Taking the story
all over the world, focusingheav-
ily on two new villains - these
tactics intend to keep the mate-
rial from being stale, but instead
leave little room for smaller
characters to shine and forces
the whole thing to feel a bit scat-
tered.
Hanna and I both left the the-
ater thinking that our "Muppets
Most Wanted" experience wasn't
as good as our first date, and I'd
like to think that comments more
on the quality of the film, than on
our abilitytohave fun together.

Students fight to
'Take Back the RC'

Lackluster'Divergent'

East Quad residents
look to reinvigorate
old hall atmosphere
By ALEX BERNARD
For the Daily
Late Sunday night, a group of
students painted a mural in the
basement of East Quad. They did
so without permission or approv-
al, but with a very specific vision
in mind. In big bold letters, they
wrote "the WORK OF ART IS A
SCREAM OF FREEDOM - Chris-
to."
Two days later, East Quad
maintenance staff painted overthe
mural. That same day, the Face-
book page "Take Back the RC" was
launched.
The page's title references the
2012-2013 renovations to East
Quad, which have given the dorms
an almost "hotel-like" atmosphere
(blank white walls, cushy chairs,
a law firm-esque dining hall, etc.).
Presently, there is a zero-tolerance
policy for wall murals atcEast Quad
- but that may be changing fairly
soon.
RC students are pushing for
a return to the old EQ commu-
nity, which was characterized by
underground music venues, paint-
covered walls and a generally
grungy ambiance. Without a suit-
able creation space though, many
students believe a suitable RC is
not possible. The Residential Col-
lege is in East Quad, but as of right
now, the two might not be inter-
changeable.
Since the removal of the Christo
quote,othermuralshavesprungup
throughout EQ, presumably in the
middle of the night. The mainte-
nance staff has been quick to paint
over these new creations as well,
though not quick enough. Pictures
of the paintings were posted to
the "Take Back the RC" Facebook
page, which has accrued 350+1likes
and spurred an email from Profes-
sor Angela Dillard, Director of the
Residential College.
I had a chance to sit down with
the founders of the page and later,
the muralists themselves. (Both
the page founders and the mural-
ists wish to remain anonymous
while the projectcontinues.)

"We wanted to create some-
thing that had the chance to stay
up forever ... The purpose wasn't
just to send a message, it was to
make something that had the
potential to stay there as a piece of
art."
The founders of the "Take Back
the RC" Facebook page explained
that the page wasn't created to
inspire or incite the painting of
murals, but rather to document
them.
"We as a page are not encourag-
ing students to do anything. We
really want to avoid encouraging
people to vandalize things," one
said.
The founders said that the page
is about "promoting an environ-
ment where RC students have the
ability to express themselves cre-
atively and freely."
According to them, this feeling
has not existed at all in the new
building.
"The housing administration
sees (the new East Quad) as their
shining new object, whereas RC
students see this as more of a blank
canvas."
They mentioned instances of
"completely harmless, completely
removable, completely non-per-
manent art that have gone up
around the building." These pieces
were promptly removed, usually
on the same day.
On March 19, just one day after
the launch of "Take Back the RC,"
Residential College director Ange-
la Dillard sent out an email to the
entire Residential College (stu-
dents, staff and faculty), address-
ing the murals and the movement.
Notably, Professor Dillard opened
with the line, "Every work of Art
is a scream for Freedom," which
was the quote included in the first
mural.
Dillard addressed the desire
for murals by referencing an
older "Guide to the RC" from the
1970s/'80s. The Guide detailed the
old process for creating murals in
East Quad. The procedure includ-
ed approval from both residents
and the Housing Coordinator,
restrictions on painting spaces and
the requirement that "only paint
can be used." Suffice to say, this
was not a zero tolerance policy.
Along with the optimistic
message, Professor Dillard also

addressed the use of murals as a
message.
"We ought to be respectful of
our colleagues in Housing who are
charged with the maintenance of
our shared spaces, and we need to
be respectful of each other ... Fur-
ther acts, I'm afraid, will start to
look more like vandalism and I'm
worried about that dynamic that
oftenseemsto takethingstoo far."
The page founders said that the
'70s and '80s policy outlined in the
email "sounds reasonable," saying
they'd agree to this proposal if it
were proposed during negotia-
tions.
The students, however,
remarked, that the process
wouldn't be as easy as Dillard
implied in the email.'
"She came off as a little bit too
optimistic that we would be able to
easily reach a compromise. I'm not
sure any negotiations that might
occur would be that easy."
They said that the email's
positive tone may simply be an
appeasement method to prevent
other students from painting
future murals. Nevertheless, the
students remained cautiously opti-
mistic: "If we facilitate an open
conversation ... hopefully some-
thing will be reached that's going
to allow creation to occur in the
way thatcit did in old East Quad."
Looking toward the future,
a petition has been released on
the Facebook page detailing the
movement and the its goals. As
signatures are accumulated, the
founders are also in the process of
organizing a group to meet with
Dillard and University Housing
officials.
Likewise, the muralists said
that, while they have ideas, no
murals are planned for the near
future. The artists warned that
more murals would "damage the
trust" between Housing and stu-
dents.
"I don't think anything that
wentup officially right now would
benefitthe cause in any other way."
said one of the artists."
And yet, they too, remained
optimistic about the future of the
RC.
As the founders said, hopefully
in the future "Take Back the RC"
will be changed to "RC Murals."
We'll see.

CONCERT PREVIEW
Son Lux talks life as a rising star

By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Music Editor
Ryan Lott's music is, well,
hard to describe.
Lott, better known as Son
Lux, has three
solo studio Soi Lux (with
albums, three
EPs, a project Leverage Models)
with Serengeti Monday at
nd Sufjan Ste- 8p.m.
vens as Sisy-
phus, a handful MagcStck

and program-
ming credits
on feature films, a performance
with the Young People's Chorus
of New York City at Carnegie Hall
and a weeklong residency at the
Joyce Theater with a dance com-
pany, among other projects. Pro-
lific might be an understatement.
It is this ability to seamlessly
fuse inspiration and collabora-
tion across a myriad of genres
and styles that has cemented
Son Lux as one of today's most
exciting, mysterious and forever-
expanding musicians. His voice
- light, floating but piercing - is
yet another instrument and, as
on his excellent 2013 release Lan-
terns, is usually complimented by
his own lush, operatic and often-
times schizophrenic production.
Still, while solo work takes up the
majority of his time, collaboration
continues to provide inspiration.
"I always look for people who
are similar to me in a way but
also very different," Lott said in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily. "I find that collaboration
is a really successful avenue to
discover new things about myself
and music in general."
Recently, Lott collaborated
with Lorde on a revised version
of "Easy (Switch Screens)" a track
from Lanterns. The result is magi-

cal - over Lott's syncopated and
sparse drums, Lorde sings with a
drawling menace found nowhere
on Pure Heroine to create a mas-
terful and cryptic landscape that
is really a genre of its own.
The collaboration came about
through Twitter, where Lorde,
who Lott described as "an
impressive and very cute chick,"
reached out to Lott to express
her love for his first record. After
the two connected, they decided
that Lorde would track her own
vocals and write to the original
instrumental. Lott described the
process as a give and take, a kind
of response and reaction in which
both he and Lorde truly collabo-
rated to revise, if not recreate, the
first version of "Easy."
For someone who puts so
much effort into every collabo-
ration and studio release, it's not
surprising that Lott put massive
amounts of work into developing
his live show. And if you know
his music, you can imagine that
it doesn't translate onto the stage
the way other artists' music does.
"The way I create music is
not by writing out all the music,
giving parts to the players and
capturing it on a microphone ...
I never think of music that way
but on stage that's exactly what
you're doing," he said.
As a result, Lott and his team
spent significant time reverse
engineering, programing and
generally reimagining his music
in order to design a live show
"that honors the recording in
such a way that it makes for a
unique live experience," he said.
On his current tour, Lott is
joined by Leverage Models, an
expansive and infectious dance-
rock collective fronted by Shan-
non Fields. The group released its
self-titled debut album last Octo-
ber to impressive critical praise

from a who's who of independent
music outlets.
As can be expected from any
artist signed to an independent
label, Lott has a love/hate rela-
tionship with the music business
and music coverage. Discussing
the recognition he received from
Lanterns, Lott said, "I wish I
could say what distinguishes that
album from my previous albums
... I do know the sad truth, that
part of the reason is plain, old-
fashioned money." It takes money
to create an album, money to tour
and money to promote. Basically,
being an artist takes a whole lot
of money, a lot more than the
average listener most likely real-
izes.
In addition to funding proj-
ects, there's the coverage to deal
with.
"While my second record was
really well-reviewed, some key
people didn't review it, like Pitch-
fork refused to review it. That
kind of took me out of the equa-
tion," Lott said, Still, as much as
he makes music simply for the
art, he can't deny the benefits
that come with being acknowl-
edged by big publications.
"(Pitchfork) gave a track from
Lanterns 'Best New Track,'
which I had mixed feelings
about, but I was happy with the
impact in that it trickled down,"
Lott explained.
For "buzzing" and inde-
pendent artists like Son Lux,
something like a Pitchfork com-
mendation can be enough to
bring fame and a new legion of
fans. But Pitchfork review or not,
Lott's continuing to make music
- whether on his own, with
Lorde or with one of the count-
less future projects he's surely
dreaming up - and rest assured,
it's going to sound like nothing
you've ever heard before.

y coach Red Berenson guided his program to 22 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, but the Wolverines have now fallen short twice ina row. Their loss to Penn State on Thursday significantly hurt their positioning for an at-large

By ERIN LENNON
DailySportsWriter
Sitting at the podium
Thursday evening in St. Paul,
Minn., Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson answered
questions from the media,
his face illuminated by two
spotlights, eyes glassy.
With your resume as it stands
right now, do you think you get

into the NCAA Tournament?
"Some people look at it right
now and they'll say we've fallen
down to wherever we've fallen,"
he said. "I'm not one of those."
Instead, he said, the
Wolverines had been focused
on the one game they could
have controlled, a first-round
loss to Penn State in the Big Ten
Tournament.
But on Selection Sunday,

Berenson didn't have to
speculate about the immediate
future. Michigan finished15th in
the PairWise rankings, missing
out on the NCAA Tournament
for a second straight year and
starting a new streak after
snapping a 22-year-long one.
"There was still a glimmer of
hope, but we didn't deserve it,"
Berenson said Sunday. "I feel
worse this year. Last year was

the end of an era - Michigan
had had a lot of momentum
getting into the tournament
and maybe being a regular in
the tournament was taken for
granted - but last year it wasn't
even close ... This should have
been a bounce-back year."
Saturday, the Wolverines held
their breath - some monitoring
Twitter, the others streaming
the game online - as Western

Michigan took on North Dakota
in the North Central Hockey
Conference consolation game.
They rooted for the Broncos, who
had bested them in the Great

months prior, even if they didn't
check the score until the end.

Hill Auditorium and the young
rapper from Chicago was in
between songs and his signature
high-pitched laughs.
. He strolled up to the mic
stand and said, "I was watching
your game earlier. Congrats on
the win." The Wolverines had
just defeated Texas, 79-65, for a
game that vaulted them into the
Sweet 16 for the second straight
year.
'That announcement got
applause and cheers, but the
sound didn't come close to
replicatingthe noise that came
from the crowd after the next
thing he said.
"Y'all got a few more wins
left, though." It was a statement,
declarative more than wishful.
Because, well, why not?
This team lost its three
best players from last year's
Final Four squad. This team is
succeeding with a true freshman
running the show at point guard,
despite the fact that Walton is
averaging less than three assists
per game. This team is relying
ni potential NBA lottery pick
Glenn Robinson III to regain
his confidence and figure out his
offensive role, even though the
kid goes from inert to aggressive
to inert again quicker than a bad
burrito.
But why would people expect
Michigan get back to the Final
Four this year?

I can't handle losing. I can't
handle ateam underachieving,
that's the most disappointing
part. And this team definitely
underachieved."
We're here now, in the new
normal of Michigan hockey,
where postseason wins are
scarce and a 74-year old head
coach is losing like nobody could
have predicted.
The Michigan football team
is somewhere in the middle.
Last season was the worst in
recent memory, but there's a
new offensive coordinator.
The offensive line had more
holes than a paper plate after
steak night, but Michigan is
considering trying to sign
former Alabama offensive
lineman Chad Lindsay. The
defense was inconsistent at
best, but prized recruit Jabrill
Peppers should have a hand in
fixing that.
So on and so on.
Last week, after fifth-year
senior quarterback Devin
Gardner tried convincing
reporters that the Wolverines are
considering a true freshman for
their starting quarterback job,
someone asked him if Michigan
was now a basketball school.
Gardner chuckled and said,
"This is a football school. This is
Michigan - you know that."
He might be right. He might
not be. But the fact he even
had to answer the question
means there is a new normal in
Ann Arbor, where excitement
about spring football practice
is minimal, the hockey team
is sitting at home and the
basketball team is making
a habit of dancing late into
March.

The answer is because this is

the majority of the offensive
headlines, as its 14 3-pointers

Wolverines sweep Hoosiers

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
With her team preparing for
its first home series of the season,
Carol Hutchins' main worry was
distractions.
The Michigan softball coach
wasn't sure how her players
would handle being on their
own schedules before a game as
opposed to the closer-supervised
road schedules.
Apparently, they still do pretty
well.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines
(3-0 Big Ten, 22-6 overall) swept
Indiana over the weekend,
racking up 29 runs in three
mercy-rule victories.
They won both halves of a
Friday doubleheader by scores
of 8-0 and 9-1, respectively, and
finished off the series with a
decisive 12-3 victory.
Junior left-hander Haylie
Wagner pitched 11 scoreless
innings over the course of
the weekend and improved to
15-0 this season, while junior
right-hander Sara Driesenga
appeared to regain her control
en route to her first win of the
year Friday night.
Sophomore shortstop Sierra
Romero was pitched around for
most of the series - recording
six walks - but made the most
of every opportunity she did
get, batting 3-for-4 with two
home runs.
After walking Romero four
consecutive times in the series
opener Friday afternoon, the
Hoosiers (0-3 Big Ten, 8-21
Overall) decided to pitch to her
with two outs and the bases
empty in the second game of
the doubleheader. Romero,
eager for a pitch she could
finally hit, jacked the ball into
the loth row of the bleachers in
right center field.
"I was just waiting for a pitch
to come a little closer to the
plate," Romerosaid. "She brought
that one in and I just saw it and

took it."
She nearly added another,
too, when she got hold of a
fourth-inning fastball and
drove it to the warning track for
a long fly out. The ball appeared
destined to clear the fence
before running into a powerful
wind out of right field that
affected fly balls all game.
The wind was gone by
Saturday, though, and freshman
outfielder Kelly Christner - who
entered the game at first base -
drove whatshe called a"meatball
over the plate" 15 feet over the top
row of the stands in right. That
homer secured a 12-3 mercy-rule
victory for the Wolverines.
"Unlike other girls, I usually
only get one at bat and I have to
make the most it," Christner said.
Wagner could have won the
series opener by herself. The

junior gave up six hits but no runs
in the circle, and went 2-2 at the
plate with a home run.
That was all the run support
Wagner would ultimately need,
as Michigan won the opener 8-0.
In the back half of the
doubleheader, Driesenga looked
solid after her infield helped get
her out of a first-inning jam.
After allowing a runner to
reach third base with one out,
Romero and junior catcher
Lauren Sweet combined for a
pickoff to take some pressure
off Driesenga. One RBI triple
notwithstanding, the righty
cruised to a 9-1victorycthatended
in the fifth inning.
Christner ended Saturday's
game with an emphatic long
ball after the Wolverines started
the game down 3-0. Freshman
right-hander Megan Betsa was

tentative in the circle and the
Hoosiers exploited it - scoring
two runs in the first and leading
off the second inning with a solo
shot to chase Betsa from her
home opener.
"You can tell they're a little
nervy," Hutchins said. "They're
always a little nervy their first
game on Alumni Field."
Wagner came into the game
in relief, throwing five shutout
innings before Christner's bomb
ended the game in the sixth.
Before then, though, freshman
infielder Lindsay Montemarano
blasted her first career home
run over the left-field foul pole.
Indiana's manager came out to
argue the call, but to no avail.
The Montemarano blast tied the
game, and Michigan never looked
back, on its way to a resounding
weekend sweep.

W rE:I
On wrestling: Grajales
ends season a winner

Notthis time.
By the time fifth-
year senior
Eric Grajales
warmed up
for his match
Saturday
night,
patience had
worn thin.
It was the ZACH
Round of SHAW
12 match at
the NCAA
Championships in Oklahoma
City, meaning Grajales would
be namedlan All-American with
a win.
Making it there was an
accomplishment itself, but
Grajales was far from finished.
Twice before in his career had
Grajales fallen in the Round of
12, coming just shortof being
an All-American. As Grajales
was introduced to the crowd,
Grajales was sure of one thing
regarding his past failures.
Not this time.
As he and No. 3 Chris
Vollalonga of Cornell walked
toward the center of the mat in
what could be the last match
of his career, Grajales was on a
mission.
Less than two minutes in,
the ninth-seeded Grajales
proved he was serious, taking
down Vollalonga on the edge
of the ring. With the honor
he had been working toward
his entire life within grasp,
Grajales refused to let go.
Grajales remained on top
for 3:12 of riding time, each
second bringing him closer to
redeemingthe past.
When the final buzzer
sounded, Grajales had stolen
the match and the honor from
Vollalonga. With blood dripping
from his lips, the senior couldn't
help but smile when the official
raised his arm in victory.
"It's a great feeling," Grajales
told MGoBlue.com following
the match. "I'm happy, and I'm

satisfied. I've got a smile on my
face, and it'll stay there for a
little while."
On a team that has seen a
youth take over this season,
Grajales rarely recieved the
credit he deserved. But as his
teammates were eliminated one-
by-one, Grajales kept pushing.
Even after beingnamed All-
American, he kept pushing,
taking down three more ranked
opponents to claim third in the
149-pound weight class. The
Wolverines took 17th at the
tournament after beingseeded
inside the top 10, but the story of
the weekend was Grajales, not
the touted freshmen.
Notthis time.
The weekend was supposed
to belong to freshman Adam
Coon. After going 29-1 in his
first regular-season campaign,
Coon had established himself as
the best wrestler in the country.
Even when showing a human
side on the mat for the first time
when stumblingto a1-2 record
at the Big Ten Championships,
many figured it would only
refuel his hunger before taking
it out on the rest of the country.
It wasn't until a four-
overtime loss to Iowa's Bobby
Telford in the quarterfinals that
losing was even considered as an
option. But as Coon fell into the
loser's bracket, something else
disappeared too. The man many
thought could - would - win
the national heavyweight title
fell to Ohio's Jeremy Johnson in
the Round of 12, failingto be an
All-American in his first of four
tries.
Not this time.
Over the summer, the wide-
eyed freshmen who walked
through the Bahna Wrestling
Center doors to begin their
careers as Wolverines carried
more than just their bags. The
11 of them combined to make
up the nation's No.1 recruiting
class, expected to one day
deliver the program's first-ever
national title.

In the redshirt-heavy sport,
the group was supposed to bulk
up in the practice room and
prepare to explode on the scene
next season. But as the weeks
wore on and reigning starters
fell victim to injury or slumping
performance, the talent on the
bench became too much to
contain. With Grajales and Dan
Yates as the only seniors in the
lineup, the Wolverines beat six
top-12 teams en route to their
best regular season finish since
2006.
But on the biggest stage last
weekend, the young Michigan
squad proved it wasn't ready.
Not this time.
"It was a great experience
for our young guys tocome in
here," said Michigan coach Joe
McFarland. "But historically,
this tournament has been tough
on freshmen.
"It should be a motivator for
them. None of these guys are
happy at all about not making
the podium. You've got to carry
that feeling and remember it
every time things get difficult
in a training session, every time
you need to get up early in the
off-season for a run."
There's no denying bluer
skies lie ahead for the
Wolverines. With three more
years of Coon, five other NCAA
qualifiers back in the lineup,
2013 freshman sensation Taylor
Massa coming back from a
redshirt and junior captain
Max Huntley returning from
season-ending surgery next
season, Michigan will be eyeing
its first top-10 finish in seven
years. Michigan wrestling will
return to greatness soon and
finish among the best in the
country for years to come.
Just not this time.
This time, the story and glory
belong to Grajales. After five
years in Ann Arbor, the veteran
finally got his taste of glory.
This time, Eric Grajales
finally ended his season a
winner.

But ifa season comes down
to beating the Nittany Lions,
proud owners of three regular-
season Big Ten wins, something
is wrong no matter the result.
Yes, you can point to it and say
that the narrative would have
been different, but this year
has been a conglomeration of
inches, enough that the chasm
between Michigan and its
former glory seems miles wide.
The puck spun and spun and
didn't go in, and Berenson and
Bennett finally faced the reality
that has been threateningto
unfold since the Wolverines
first stagnated in December
and January. It's something
that may be surprising to the
players, but it's not to those
who have been watching them
since October.
The only opponent Michigan
could beat consistently was itself.
Fatigue sets in by the end
of a 60-minute hockey game.
That's Berenson's expectation
- If you're not tired after
three periods, you're doing
something wrong.
What was left, then, after

minutes of overtime?
Exhaustion, and the memory
of a moment that had teased
them with the tantalizing allure
of the NCAA Tournament.
Just 1:05 after takeoff in
Minneapolis, wheels touch down

the tarmac, another bus awaits.
This one wasn't supposed to be
there that night, either.

later, the day is mercifully over.
With that, their season
has come to a bitter, painful

to go back to Michigan to take
his finals. They looked at him
like he was crazy.
"I told the NHL team what
I was going to do," Berenson
said. "And that's 50 years ago,
when the NHL was the dream
of every kid and there were only
six teams. You felt like you had
died and gone to heaven if you
played in the NHL. You'd play
for nothing, but still, school was
importantto me, and it better be
important to you."
He expressed that he disliked
that Trouba and Merrill
"dropped the ball" on school
after last season. However,
Berenson says he's still in
contact with those, players in
hopes to iron out their progress
toward a degree.
Berenson said Moffatt is
the team's best student and
wanted to remind him hockey
shouldn't be what stands in the
way from academic success.
Moffatt will head to Cleveland
to play for the Colorado
Avalanche's AHL affiliate
before returning to Ann Arbor
to graduate in May.
Meanwhile, Berenson still
emphasizes graduating to the
rest of his seniors, including
Mac Bennett and Derek
DeBlois. Both players said
they'd be in contact with their
agents this week about their
future hockey careers.
Bennett is tied to the
Canadiens, while DeBlois is still
an undrafted free agent.

One more inch and the bags
are still unpacked and the plane
is still sitting at Willow Run
airport.
But one inch doesn't change
the identity of this Michigan
team.
A week ago, the Wolverines
embarrassed the top-ranked
Golden Gophers, 6-2. In
February, they completed
what was essentially a sweep
of Wisconsin. Thursday, they
couldn't beat the Nittany Lions
- the conference's worst team,
by a wide margin - on a neutral
site with everything on the line.
What gives? Is it talent?
Mentality? Luck? Some
combination of the three?
One more inch, and

They'll say that one more

different story.
