Content warning: Sexual assault
More 
than 
one 
hundred 

protesters 
gathered 
outside 

the Postma Family Clubhouse 
at the University of Michigan 
Golf Course Sept. 23, where 
the Board of Regents were 
meeting in person for the first 
time since March 2020. The 
crowd protested the University’s 
handling 
of 
allegations 
of 

sexual 
abuse 
against 
late 

University 
athletic 
doctor 

Robert Anderson and demanded 
stronger 
accountability 
from 

the administration on behalf of 
survivors. 

The 
protest, 
which 
was 

organized 
by 
the 
student 

organization Michigan Students 
Against Sexual Assault, took 
place an hour before the Board 
of 
Regents 
meeting 
started. 

The general protest session was 
followed by speeches from some 
survivors of Anderson’s abuse. 
Later, the attendees protested 
on the sidewalk as the Regents 
entered the building. 

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, LSA junior 
Porter Hughes, press secretary 
for MSASA, said one of the 
goals of the protest was to 

raise awareness about sexual 
misconduct at the University to 
try to prevent other people from 
having to experience what the 
Anderson victims went through. 
 

“We hope to bring awareness 

to the greater public about 
this issue — it really has not 
gotten the press coverage it 
deserves,” Hughes said. “Also to 
pressure for more reforms and 
push for more action and more 
community dialogue on what 
changes are necessary to make 
sure something like this never 
happens again.” 

In May, hundreds of survivors 

of Anderson’s abuse filed a 
class 
action 
lawsuit 
against 

the University, calling on the 
University to rethink how it 
approaches sexual misconduct 
and abuse. The complaint, led by 
LSA senior Josephine Graham, 
says the University’s lack of 
action against Anderson allowed 
his behavior to continue for 
decades. The University filed a 
response to the suit in August, 
where it argued to dismiss the 
case on the grounds that Graham 
needed “to wait until she has 
experienced 
sexual 
violence 

before bringing her injunctive 
relief claims.”

A Target location officially opened 

at 231 S. State Street in downtown 
Ann Arbor on Sept. 21, the former 
location of an Urban Outfitters.

The 
“small 
format” 
store, 

standing at 12,000 square feet, was 
first announced in December 2020. 
These scaled-down stores provide 
a specifically curated selection of 
goods designed to appeal to students 
on campus, according to A Bullseye 
View. 

Similar 
stores 
have 
opened 

on college campuses across the 
nation, including at Michigan State 
University, New York University 
and the University of Southern 
California.

University of Michigan students 

have previously raised concerns 
about the lack of a more affordable 
grocery store within a walkable 
distance to campus. The addition 
of this Target will offer students a 
walkable, convenient grocery option, 
according to Tricia George, a team 
lead for Target.

“I think it’s going to have a huge 

impact,” George said. “What I’ve 
been hearing just in the last half 
hour, I’ve talked to some of the 
guests, the grocery is the biggest 
thing that they’re so excited about 
because there’s not really a grocery 
store within walking distance for a 
lot of the students.”

Store Director James Newbill said 

he hopes the new Target will not 
only be a place where the students 

can buy groceries but where they can 
find community as well. 

“It was really important to us 

that we entered this community, 
because the students don’t have a 
place that’s really quick for them 
to get those fresh food options, and 
we’re able to provide them,” Newbill 
said. “The service piece is super 
important to me in our entire store, 
making sure that students are being 
helped because sometimes it is really 
fast-paced around here. And they 
don’t really get that service that they 
need.”

Newbill 
said 
he 
encourages 

students to be actively engaged in the 
process of curating Target’s product 
collections so that the store satisfies 
customers’ needs. 

“I want people to tell me the 

collection that they want because we 
can order things,” Newbill said. “We 
can get a different assortment, but 
it’s literally just to serve students on 
campus. We can get items that they 
normally can’t get shipped here or to 
their dorms.” 

LSA freshman Jessi Hinterman 

said she is looking forward to having 
a grocery store within walking 
distance from her dorm. 

“I’m excited to not wait in 

Walgreens for anything,” Hinterman 
said. “I mean, we have (a Target) at 
home, and it’s the nicest thing. I’m 
there all the time. Honestly, (it’s) 
convenient. So having one here is 
amazing.”

Pulitzer 
Prize-winning 

journalist 
Nikole 
Hannah-

Jones, founder of The New York 
Times Magazine’s 1619 Project, 
spoke to more than 250 members 
of the University of Michigan 
and Ann Arbor communities in 
Rackham Auditorium on Sept. 
22. The event was hosted by 
the Ann Arbor District Library 
and touched on the impact of 
the project two years after its 
release.

The 
1619 
Project 
is 
a 

multimedia 
initiative 
aiming 

to reframe the United States’ 
history 
of 
slavery 
and 
the 

ongoing consequences of nearly 
200 years of legal enslavement. 
Jones discussed the criticism 
she has faced since the project’s 
release, 
most 
notably 
its 

common conflation with critical 
race theory. 

Much of the backlash — 

such 
as 
former 
President 

Donald Trump’s creation of a 
1776 commission to promote 
“patriotic education” in response 
to the 1619 project — has resulted 
in various attempts to pass bills 
prohibiting the teaching of the 
project, or critical race theory, 
in public schools. 

Michigan state Sen. Lana 

Theis, R-Brighton, introduced a 
bill in May to decrease annual 
funding of public schools by 5% 
if critical race theory, or related 
content like The 1619 Project, is 
included in school curriculum.

U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., 

one critic of the project, has 
tried to prohibit it from being 
taught in public schools and 

introduced a federal bill to do so 
in July 2020.“(The) 1619 Project 
is a racially divisive, revisionist 
account of history that denies 
the noble principles of freedom 
and equality on which our nation 
was founded,” the bill says. 

Jones dismissed the project’s 

critics, defending the research 
behind her project. 

“I have to say I think I’m a 

pretty good journalist, but I 
didn’t know how a single word 
of journalism in the New York 
Times could threaten the very 
integrity of the United States of 
America,” Hannah-Jones said. 

Jones 
criticized 
the 

American 
education 
system 

for inadequately critiquing the 
social inequities that underlie 
the country’s history. 

“They 
really 
want 

propagandistic 
history 
to 

be taught in the classroom,” 
Hannah-Jones 
said. 
“A 

classroom that teaches American 
exceptionalism, when really, of 
course, the classroom should be 
teaching us to question and have 
skepticism.”

LSA 
freshman 
April 

Hamilton, 
who 
attended 

the discussion, said she is 
frustrated with the hyper-
focus on critical race theory 
in conversations about public 
school curriculum. 

“There’s so many other issues 

that we could be focusing on,” 
Hamilton said. “But this is 
something that the Right has 
really fixated on.” 

Public Policy graduate student 

Jessica 
Hartshorn 
said 
she 

thinks the reality of American 
history 
that 
Hannah-Jones 

portrayed cannot be disputed.

I 

f the city of Ann Arbor needed 
any 
further 
indication, 

the musical “Heat Waves” 

radiating from the Crisler Center 
on Sept. 23 made it official: The 
Wolverines are back on campus. As 
the first “Welcome to Michigan” 
Concert in recent years, Thursday 
night’s event featured British indie 
rock band Glass Animals and was 
completely free for the more than 
8,000 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students in attendance.

Darin 
Martin, 
assistant 

director for the Center for Campus 
Involvement, wrote in an email to 
The Michigan Daily that Big Ticket 
Productions — the University’s 
concert production organization 
— chose Glass Animals to play at 
the Crisler because of their rising 
popularity worldwide.

“Big Ticket Productions’ mission 

is to bring quality, big name 
entertainment to campus that 
students want to see and can enjoy 
at an affordable rate,” Martin wrote.

The concert was a stop on the 

band’s international “Dreamland” 
Tour, showcasing Glass Animals’ 

latest album released Aug. 7, 2020. 
On Sep. 11 of this year, their song 
“Heat Waves” peaked at no. 1 on the 
Billboard Hot Alternative Songs list. 
Glass Animals performed “Heat 
Waves” as the final song of the 
night, turning the mic to the crowd 
during the chorus to encourage 
students to sing along.

LSA sophomore Rié Vander 

Schuur attended the concert and 
said she was only familiar with 
“Heat Waves” and one other Glass 
Animals song going in. Still, Vander 
Schuur said she enjoyed watching 
Daya’s opening performance and 
being exposed to some of the lesser-

known numbers on Glass Animals’ 
setlist.

“My favorite part was definitely 

the ending because ‘Heat Waves’ … 
is their most popular song, so it was 
fun for everyone to sing along and 
jump around,” Vander Shuur said.

The University first announced 

the concert Sept. 12, with tickets 
— one per student — at first only 
being available for first- and second-
year undergraduate students at the 
Michigan Union Ticket Office and 
online beginning at 10 a.m. on Sept. 
14.

Protestors stand outside of the Board of Regents meeting on Sept. 23 to demand better protections for survivors of sexual assault.


The President of Latvia, his Excel-

lency Egils Levits, discussed several key 
issues regarding foreign and domestic 
policy at an event hosted by the 
Uni-

versity of Michigan Weiser Center for 
Europe and Eurasia and the University 
of Michigan Law School on Sept. 23.

The 
talk 
included 
Geneviève 

Zubrzycki, WCEE director and profes-
sor of sociology, and Daniel Halbers-
tam, Eric Stein Collegiate Professor of 
Law and director of the European Legal 
Studies Program, as moderators.

Levits has held office since July 2019. 

He previously served as vice prime min-
ister, minister for justice and Latvia’s 
ambassador to Hungary, Austria and 
Switzerland. Levits was also the first 
Latvian judge at the European Court of 
Human Rights from 1995 to 2004 and a 
judge of the European Court of Justice 

from 2004 to 2019.

Next year will be the 100-year anni-

versary of diplomatic relations between 
the United States and Latvia. Frederick 
Coleman, the first ambassador of the 
United States to Latvia from 1922 to 
1931, obtained his bachelor’s and law 
degree from the University of Michi-
gan.

The event began with Levits discuss-

ing the history of Latvia and its road to 
independence. The Soviet Union occu-
pied Latvia during World War II until 
1990 when the state was restored.

“Democratic movements were very 

important, not only in regards to the 
restoration of (Latvian) independence 

but also in changing the European 
political map,” Levits said. “The Soviet 
Union broke up as a result of the inde-
pendent movements of Estonia, Latvia 
and Lithuania.”

Levits also addressed the current 

situation between Russia and Belar-
us, where there has been a repres-
sion of democratic movements since 
World War II. He said Latvia supports 
demands for new, free and fair elections 
in Belarus.

Levits talked about current events, 

including Latvia’s involvement in the 
European Union. Levits said he would 
like to see more effective European 
policy with the “no harm principle,” in 
which every country is taken into con-
sideration when taking political action.

“We are for further development 

and deepening of the European Union, 
of the common market,” Levits said. 
“We are also for more visible European 
foreign policy.”

According to Levits, Latvia is work-

ing with Estonia and Lithuania to 
ensure a strong community and address 
the issues in Belarus.

In an interview with The Michi-

gan Daily, Aiva Rozenberga, a public 
relations advisor to Levits, said trans-
parency in the European Union is 
especially vital for small countries like 
Latvia, which has a population of less 
than 2 million people.

“Transparency is very important 

because being a smaller country, as 
Latvia is, it’s important that all the 27 
member countries have the same voice 
so that everybody can participate in 
this process where you make decisions 
about the whole continent,” Rozenber-

ga said.

Halberstam asked Levits to speak on 

the relationship between the European 
Union and the United States, citing 
President Biden’s recent decision to stop 
consulting European allies on Afghani-
stan and the Australian Submarine 
Agreement as well as his meeting with 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
in the White House Wednesday.

Levits explained the importance of 

collaboration between Western coun-
tries to maintain power and democratic 
values, especially as China continues to 
grow both economically and politically.

“The United States and Europe are 

based on the same democratic val-
ues, and this is very important when 
we have so few centers of power in 
the world,” Levits said. “We should 
work together in order to defend the 
threats to our fundamental beliefs — for 
democracy and for rule of law.”

Rozenberga talked about the impor-

tance of good relations between the 
United States and Europe, regardless of 
changes in the administration.

“It’s very important for the Bal-

tic States, not just for Latvia, but for 
the whole region to have very strong 
transatlantic ties,” Rozenberga said. “It 
means very active political dialogue, 
and it means active contact in the eco-
nomic sphere and in the military as part 
of NATO. When the situation changes 
geopolitically still, we know that we are 
one family.”

Rackham student Anna Tanalski, 

a second-year student in the Masters 
of International Regional Studies pro-
gram, said she was honored to be able 
to attend the event and found Lev-

its’s focus on democratic values to be 
impactful.

“I think the most impactful subject 

that he touched upon was maintaining 
allyships and relationships with neigh-
boring countries and their unity in the 
face of collective difficulties, whether it 
be the crisis of refugees or whether it be 
kind of this general resistance to a feel-
ing of some people wanting a return to 
Soviet values,” Tanalski said.

During the open Q&A section of the 

event, an audience member asked Lev-
its about the state of Latvia’s judicial 
system, which he referred to as “one 
of the weakest institutions” due to the 
inefficiency of the courts.

Levits responded, explaining that 

over the past 10 years, the judicial 
system in Latvia has become much 
more efficient. He plans to continue 
this growth by introducing a change 
in criminal procedure law that allows 
judges to deliver judgement. Levits said 
this change will contribute to further 
developing an efficient court system in 
the country.

Rozenberga said Latvia had to build 

its legal system from scratch following 
its restoration of independence from the 
Soviet Union.

“It has been a very hard job, and as 

the President stated today, we have a 
very strong legal system, except a few 
technical things that we still have to 
fix and he’s currently working on that,” 
Rozenberga said. “Being a lawyer and 
judge in his previous professions, he 
really knows what needs to be done.”

Survivors of Dr. Robert E. 

Anderson — a former University of 
Michigan doctor with hundreds of 
sexual abuse allegations against him 
dating back to the 1970s — spoke to 
the Board of Regents about their 
experiences with Anderson while 
they were students at the first 
in-person meeting for the Regents 
since March 2020. 

The meeting was held at the 

Postma Family Clubhouse on the 
University golf course. Regent Ron 
Weiser (R) showed up 30 minutes 
after the start of the meeting, 
and Regents Paul Brown (D) and 
Katherine White (D) joined the 
meeting virtually.

A crowd of more than one 

hundred protested the University’s 
handling of Anderson prior to the 
start of the meeting, and during the 
public comment period, speakers 
recounted 
their 
experiences 

with Anderson and called on the 
University for accountability. Dozens 
of University employees were alerted 
to Anderson’s abuse throughout the 
decades, according to a report by the 
law firm WilmerHale commissioned 

by the University. The University has 
received backlash for their handling 
of the Anderson allegations. 

University 
alum 
Jeffrey 

DesCamp, the first public speaker, 
said he was abused by Anderson 
while 
receiving 
a 
Federal 

Aviation Administration medical 
examination, a test he needed to take 
to receive a certification to become a 
student pilot. Anderson mandated 
that DesCamp continually return 
to his office before he could receive 
his certification, visits in which 
Anderson left DesCamp shocked 
by the magnitude of the abuse he 
experienced.

“I was savaged by (Anderson’s) 

insatiable desire to do as he pleased, 
while tears from my eyes streaked 
down my face from the pain he 
inflicted upon me,” DesCamp said. 
“I couldn’t look at him. I couldn’t 
believe any human being could do 
what he was doing to me.”

David Share, another survivor 

of 
Anderson’s 
abuse, 
stood 

before the Regents to ask them 
to take accountability for the 
wrongdoings of previous University 
administrators. Share pointed to 
the University’s common slogan 
of “Leaders and the Best” for their 
community, 
emphasizing 
that 

inaction would be contradicting that 

claim. 

“You will forfeit U-M’s right to 

the claim of being leaders and best 
if you sidestep accountability for the 
harm caused by the misdeeds and 
mistakes of University of Michigan 
leaders,” Share said. “For once and 
for all, you need to address these 
wrongs. I urge you to do so.”

Other speakers, like former 

U-M 
football 
player 
Vincent 

Washington, 
described 
feeling 

silenced by University leaders and 
appalled at the University’s seeming 
protection of Anderson. Through 
tears, Washington described why 
he felt discouraged to speak up 
about Anderson’s abuse and how the 
trauma has affected him in the years 
since.

“The question I always ask 

myself is, ‘Why didn’t I put it 
together, or object, or say something 
sooner?’” Washington said. “Coach 
Bo (Schembechler) would always 
say that the enemy of learning 
was distraction, the enemy of 
winning was being a distraction. 
So, subconsciously, I knew that if I 
became a distraction, my career at 
Michigan would be over. I carry a lot 
of guilt for this.”

Several former student-athletes 

have alleged in the WilmerHale 
report and publicly that they told 

longtime head football coach Bo 
Schembechler about the abuse. 
Matt Schembechler, Bo’s son, said 
this summer that Anderson abused 
him when he was young but that 
Bo blew off his complaint. Other 
members of the Schembechler 
family have disputed that account.

Former 
U-M 
hockey 
player 

Dean Turner said he felt that 
the University cared about their 
reputation more than Anderson 
victims like himself.

“The University could have 

put an end to this and protected 
student athletes such as myself, but 
instead they protected a rapist and 
a brand,” Turner said. “I have and 
will continue to suffer the traumas 
of this rape, as you know. Healing 
doesn’t follow a timeline, and 
neither should we.”

Regent Jordan Acker (D), chair 

of the board, thanked the survivors 
for speaking at the public hearing 
and maintained that the University 
is committed to preventing further 
abuse like that of Anderson. He said 
that he and the other regents were 
limited to what they could say due to 
the confidential mediation process 
going on in court.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

announced a finalized sexual and 
gender-based misconduct policy on 
Thursday that includes more concrete 
definitions of misconduct, clarifies 
ways to report misconduct and out-
lines procedures for addressing sexual 
and gender-based misconduct allega-
tions. This policy replaces the interim 
umbrella policy, Standard Practice 
Guide and other related policies that 
were instituted in August 2020.

The new policy will take effect on 

all three U-M campuses and Michigan 
Medicine on Oct. 1.

According to Regent Chair Jordan 

Acker (D), the new policy has been in 
the works since he was elected to the 

Board of Regents in 2018. Acker said 
the policy would aid in the University’s 
efforts to support victims of miscon-
duct and prevent misconduct from 
occurring in the first place. 

“President Schlissel and the Board 

of Regents have been focused on mak-
ing sure we improve our policies and 
procedures around sexual misconduct 
for as long as I’ve been on the Board,” 
Acker said. “This new policy and 
accompanying procedures will help 
us prevent sexual misconduct, but also 
protect survivors from unnecessary 
trauma. Although we have more work 
to do, this is a significant step forward 
and I want to commend all in the com-
munity who have worked to make this 
change happen.” 

The University has grappled with 

numerous instances of sexual mis-
conduct in recent years, including 
the cases of late U-M athletic doctor 

Robert Anderson and former Provost 
Martin Philbert. Allegations of sexual 
misconduct against professors in the 
Computer Science and Engineering 
department have also recently sur-
faced, prompting further investigation 
into the department’s climate and cul-
ture.

University President Mark Schlis-

sel said in a press release that the new 
policy reflects the University’s com-
mitment to preventing sexual miscon-
duct and supporting victims. The new 
policy is a result of feedback obtained 
from the University community, 
Schlissel said. 

“The Board of Regents, the uni-

versity’s leadership team and I 
remain sharply focused on continu-
ally improving the ways in which we 
prevent prohibited conduct, support 
survivors in our community, and 
promptly investigate reports of mis-

conduct,” Schlissel said. “This policy 
reflects important feedback from our 
entire community, including students, 
faculty, staff and alumni.”

The new policy also refers spe-

cifically to the Equity, Civil Rights and 
Title IX Office that was announced 
in July and replaced the controversial 
Office for Institutional Equity. ECRT 
handles the same allegations and cases 
that OIE did while providing more 
“support and prevention” measures, 
according to Schlissel. 

Tamiko Strickman, the former OIE 

director, currently serves as the execu-
tive director of the ECRT. Strickman 
has faced scrutiny over the past years 
for two lawsuits that were filed against 
her and officials at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln for mishandling of 
sex discrimination and misconduct 
cases.

In an interview with The Daily ear-

lier this month, Schlissel said he hopes 
the ECRT would be able to provide 
better support for the University com-
munity. 

“We took the Office of Institutional 

Equity apart and rebuilt a new organi-
zation (ECRT), covering the functions 
of the old OIE but in a different way — 
one that’s designed to provide better 
support, more outreach, better educa-
tion and integrate prevention efforts 
along with our other investigatory 
efforts,” Schlissel said. 

Schlissel said the new policy, which 

was originally planned to be imple-
mented by July 2021, was delayed 
because of new sexual misconduct 
federal guidance from the Biden 
administration.

The policy creates two distinct cat-

egories for individuals with reporting 
obligations, giving them slightly differ-
ent responsibilities.

The first category is individuals 

who have the ability to perform “cor-
rective action,” including regents, 
executive officers, head coaches, 
executive officers, chancellors and 
deans. Individuals in this category are 
required to report any and all informa-
tion they receive about prohibited con-
duct, regardless of how or when they 
received it. 

The second category includes assis-

tant and associate deans, administra-
tors, supervisors and faculty members 
who accompany students on Univer-
sity-related study abroad programs. 
Individuals who fall into this category 
are required to report instances of mis-
conduct if they became aware of the 
misconduct as part of their work for 
the University.

Wednesday, September 29, 2021 — 3

Recently, I’ve learned to use two 

phrases. I can’t, and I won’t. 

“I can’t” means I am unable to 

any longer. “I won’t” means I choose 
to protect myself from reaching this 
point again.

So now, hear me out: I can’t, and I 

won’t, accept burnout anymore. 

For one week starting today, I am 

taking a break from The Michigan 
Daily. I’ll be stepping back from the 
entirety of my job’s responsibilities, 
deleting all of my social media and 
staying away from any contact related 
to The Daily. 

This is not a decision I make 

lightly. I wouldn’t be doing this unless 
absolutely necessary, because since 
my first day here I’ve cared about The 
Daily more than for myself. 

But after almost going to the 

hospital when leaving The Daily’s 
office alone late Monday night, I refuse 
to keep allowing severe panic attacks 
as part of my day-to-day routine. I 
refuse to keep losing more hair, weight 
and blood and as nearly as much sleep. 

Yesterday, I told a friend my 

work at The Daily is ever-so-rapidly 
destroying my physical, mental and 
emotional health, not to mention 
my interpersonal and intrapersonal 
relationships or my dedication to my 
academics. He replied this destroying 
can lead to a “violent and deeply 
entrenched burnout.”

I was comforted when he said this, 

because I now finally have language 
for what has been happening to me. 
Violence. 

You may scoff at that and call 

me dramatic, call me weak. But I’ve 
disparaged myself more times than 
you ever will.

Or perhaps you’ll share this and 

call me inspirational, call me brave. 

It won’t change the fact that my job is 
unsustainable and no longer possible 
in its current form.

At the end of the day every day, 

what I really am is tired. So tired.

I take home $150 a month to work 

roughly 70 hours a week, apparently 
an outlier even among other college 
newspaper editor-in-chiefs. On top of 
being a part-time student, a daughter, 
sister, partner, roommate and friend. 
Lately, the kind of workload I’ve 
shouldered dozens of dozens of times 
before makes me crack. I’ve deemed 
myself lazy, soft, less capable than all 
of the leaders who’ve come before. My 
best friend reminds me I’m doing this 
during an unprecedented pandemic. 
I counter that The Daily was around 
during the 1918 Spanish flu. 

But it’s not just the pandemic that’s 

exacerbated the difficulties of my role. 
It’s The Daily’s 130-year-old problems 
with racism, sexism, classism and 
ableism that affect me intimately and 

near constantly. It’s running “the only 
daily newspaper in the county” and 
being prepared to be called into duty at 
any moment in case of breaking news 
for almost two school years now with 
no days off, not even on the University 
of Michigan’s “well-being break.” It’s 
not ever escaping the uncomfortable 
reality, no matter how much I want to, 
that I’m presumably the first woman 
of color to lead this organization. It’s 
my desperation to prove myself despite 
my achievements and qualifications 
after hearing some say there have been 
too many women editor-in-chiefs 
and after being told multiple times to 
my face I am where I am because of 
“diversity.” 

I know The Daily’s problems, and 

it’s not that I haven’t tried to fix them. 
In fact, I’ve done nothing but try. I ran 
for this position in hopes of making 
The Daily more accessible; those who 
work here know that’s essentially 
my buzzword. I’ve delegated all the 

responsibility possible that I can 
think 
of 
without 
overwhelming 

someone else; created new structures, 
processes and positions to make sure 
my adjustments last. A week and a 
half ago, I initiated a conversation 
on burnout among editors, and 
we’ve 
been 
practicing 
setting 

boundaries. I’ve been heartened to 
see improvement, slow but steady. 
But institutional and cultural change 
takes time, and my health can’t wait 
any longer. Honestly, in our heavily 
decentralized organization of 450 
people at its peak, assuming the lion’s 
share of this burden only makes it 
worse, because I hurt when I see The 
Daily hurt someone else.

I usually doubt my every decision, 

but I’m confident in taking this step 
back. Because as I’m writing this, for 
the first time in 48 hours, I’m no longer 
worried about falling into a panic attack 
at any moment. For the first time in 
several days, I finally feel at peace.

I was most hesitant to write this 

because I truly don’t want to scare 
others from joining or remaining at 
The Daily. Because despite it all, at this 
very moment, I can sincerely say that I 
love and care deeply about this place. 

More than any other organization, 

The Daily has changed the trajectory 
of my life and shapes who I am and 
want to be. It gives me identity and 
purpose, pride and joy, resonance 
and perspective, community and 
solidarity and memories and lifelong 
friends. Even on my toughest days, I’m 
honored to run a platform that houses 
stories that may otherwise not have a 
prominently public space.

And that’s why quitting The Daily 

is the last thing I’ll do. Because for 
now, and even now, this place is worth 
staying for. 

So I will be back, and when I am, 

I won’t know what’s next. But I will 
be more able to work with my staff to 
reimagine a better way.

The pains of sharing a photo on 

Instagram are almost never ending. A 
pimple too big, a filter too “cheugy” and a 
smile too large can all be deemed a final 
flaw. Even after finding the right photo, 
there is still the aesthetic to consider — 
pulling and twisting a photo you love to fit 
into the dollhouse that is your profile page. 
This pre-post step is mandatory: You have 
to clean up the clutter in an image, so it can 
perfectly occupy an ornate frame like an 
open house nightmare.

To be honest, this elaborate process 

is all too much for me. I haven’t posted 
on Instagram in, like, a year. Or, well, I 
haven’t posted on my “main” account that 
is. During the summer, I cultivated my 
“fake Instagram,” a.k.a finsta, as a chaotic 
conglomeration of bad poetry and midnight 
escapades to all 10 of my followers. This 
smaller, private account allowed me to vent 
about my feelings and post about private 
life in a way that my main account could 
never allow. Why in the world would I want 
my aunt — one of my many main-Instagram 
followers — to know when I’m clubbing, 
cruising and crashing?

Unlike Facebook, there is a level of 

anonymity that is fostered on Instagram. 
You’re allowed to have multiple accounts 
under the same contact information. In 
fact, these accounts aren’t considered 
connected to each other, giving the Gen Z 
user the freedom to make as many niche, 
obscure accounts as their heart desires. 
And the birth of finsta was inevitable 
after Instagram became mainstream. 
When you have hundreds of followers, 
finding a post that makes everyone happy 
is overwhelming. What might be funny to 
your college friends is “blasphemy” in the 
eyes of your uncle.

As opposed to these anonymous, niche 

accounts, the level of reality depicted on 

main Instagram accounts is abysmal. There 
is a saturated market for face editing apps. 
There are websites that will create special 
instagram caption fonts for your next post. 
On some apps, you even have the ability 
to track how and when your followers 
frequent your account.

But running a personal Instagram 

shouldn’t feel like being a marketing 
manager. Consolidating photos that are 
cohesive to your account’s “aesthetic” can 
look super cute, but is it true to oneself? 
To get those photos means leaving parts 
yourself out of the picture. Setting up 
photos at brunch feels a little artificial if 
you wouldn’t be caught awake before 1 p.m. 

on a weekend.

Social media shouldn’t feel limiting. 

Posting on your main page shouldn’t feel 
like adding set pieces to a retail display. It 
should feel like sharing what you love with 
people who care.

Sure, I have that sense of authentic 

closeness among my 10 finsta followers, 
but at what cost? Why lead this Hannah 
Montana fantasy — with girl-next-door 
Miley on a finsta and popstar Hannah on 
the main — when it is easier to just cultivate 
an authentic digital persona on one main 
account? Crusty dog photos, crying selfies 
and all? 

Gen Z has taken note of these questions, 

and Instagram culture has shifted. People 
don’t use their finstas as much, maybe 
because the pandemic showed just how 
tiring performing on social media can be 
in the end. Now, mains are messier — in a 
good way.

It starts out small. A post of a sunset is 

met with a Vine (a.k.a. an extinct TikTok 
predecessor) quote. Suddenly, Twitter 
screenshots are used to punctuate the ends 
of slideshow posts. You repost content 
from @umichaffirmations more often. 
Insta stories are now home to Spotify 
recommendations 
and 
blurry 
candid 

photos. 

I appreciate the candidness of the people 

I follow. Their mains are messy in a way 
that a room is lived in. Sometimes you don’t 
make your bed, and that is okay. Sometimes 
you have pit stains when taking a selfie, and 
that is also okay. Your pit sweat shouldn’t 
kill your happiness just like the assortment 
of cups that adorn your room isn’t clutter, 
but chic. I mean, my room right now is 
college-core, raccoon-eye chic; interior 
design is not my main concern.

The spaces we exist in shouldn’t be 

ready-made store displays. Instagram 
shouldn’t feel like the dorm room shown to 
you during a campus tour. Social media is 
not the room where all your dirty clothes, 
mismatched socks and retainers are 
thrown in the closet. That is so 2015. 

Let the chachkas you love and collect 

bathe in the sun. For so long, I thought 
social media was a thing to be graded 
or gawked at. But it can be something to 
explore and grow into when you get messy 
on main.

Messy on Main: The life and death of finsta

MATTHEW EGGERS

Daily Arts Writer

Content warning: Addiction, substance use

“Euphoria,” Gen Z’s favorite show 

about Gen Z has just announced plans for 
its second season. Based on creator Sam 
Levinson’s “own experience with anxiety, 
addiction and depression,” HBO’s racy 
drama about high school follows a group 
of students as they grapple with their own 
post-pubescent hurdles, from the pressures 
of athletic and academic stardom to deceit 
on dating apps. It’s called “Euphoria,” but “a 
feeling of intense happiness and excitement” 
is not what you feel as you begin the first 
episode, observing footage of the World 
Trade Center attacks. 

“Euphoria” begins the same way Gen 

Z was thrust into the world: amid the 
violent ruins of post 9/11 America. The 
unrelentingly heavy tone of the show, which 
depicts subjects such as drug use, violence 
and revenge child pornography, has made it 
equally loved and hated for what fans see as 
accuracy and what critics see as glorification 
of its subject matter. The backlash can 
perhaps be interpreted as an example of 
what happens when art imitates life a little 
too vibrantly, and here, Gen Z’s own trauma 
is projected back to us in moody technicolor. 

“Euphoria” stars Rue Bennett, a 17-year-

old teen struggling with addiction, who in an 
ironic twist is played by Zendaya (“Dune”), 
our generation’s favorite Disney star. The 
students are revealed to us through Rue’s 
unreliable narration, and we experience the 
highs and lows of high school as Rue does. 

As a result, while the harsh realities of 

drug use and addiction are made clear (in 

the second episode of the first season, Rue 
is shown laying in a pile of her own vomit 
after overdosing), Rue’s altered state gives 
the trippy scenes in “Euphoria” the most 
beautiful visuals, music and cinematography 
in the entire show. Yet, somehow, these scenes 
maintain a balance between being heavily 
stylized and viscerally realistic. Ultimately, 
the way “Euphoria” deals with its heaviest 
topics is uncomfortable and shocking.

“Euphoria” and its unapologetically 

bold depiction of mature themes have 
fueled many critics; some conservative 
organizations have even called for the show 
to be removed from the air due to what 
they see as the glamorization of violence, 
pills and sex. The Parents Television and 
Media Council, a U.S. Christian censorship 
advocacy group, expressed concern that 
“HBO, with its new high school-centered 
show ‘Euphoria,’ appears to be overtly, 
intentionally marketing extremely graphic 
adult content — sex, violence, profanity and 
drug use – to teens and preteens.” The media 
review platform Movie Guide has called 
upon its readers to sign a petition demanding 
HBO pull “Euphoria” from its programming, 
which it describes as “vile beyond belief.” 

It is perhaps due to all of this that 

“Euphoria” has already become a cult 
classic — Gen Z’s “Pulp Fiction.” In the years 
following the show’s release, Gen Zers have 
cultivated a so-called “Euphoria aesthetic,” 
using colors and styles emblematic of the 
show so fully and so frequently that it is 
hard to imagine our generation before 
“Euphoria” aired in 2019. Teens across the 
country began wearing glitter-tear makeup 
and dressing up as characters Cassie 
and Maddie for Halloween. The actors’ 
Instagram accounts have gained millions of 

followers, and many fashion brands catered 
towards Gen Z have adopted the bold style 
of the show’s universe. 

The way Gen Z has adopted the “Euphoria” 

aesthetic makes it feel as though the show 
is the mirror Gen Z didn’t know it needed. 
The generation’s embrace of the series is 
more about teens expressing their identity 
through technology and self-discovery and 
feeling understood than wanting to glorify 
substance use and sexual assault. 

Levinson claims that, for “Euphoria,” 

he “was just trying to capture that kind of 

heightened sense of emotion when you’re 
young, and how relationships feel.” This 
decision, he says, was made to help older 
generations understand Gen Z, and for 
members of Gen Z to realize they are not 
alone as the gap between generations 
continues 
to 
widen 
and 
technology 

increasingly impacts how we live our lives.

Like characters Rue, Jules, Cassie, 

Maddie and Nate, I was born into a post-
9/11 America. I, too, sat through lockdown 
drills, consumed media I probably shouldn’t 
have at my age. Though “Euphoria” is more 

severe than my experience, for me and 
many of my friends, the series represents 
many of the problems that we face and 
accurately reflects our generation’s fears 
and anxieties. Unlike the multitude of other 
shows about high school for Gen Z that I’ve 
recently watched, seeing these issues, albeit 
in the show’s caricatured, melodramatic 
depictions, felt cathartic and validated my 
own struggles with anxiety and technology 
throughout high school. 

“Euphoria” is Gen Z, in all of its glittery, 

confusing, pixelated glory. 

‘Euphoria’ is Gen Z’s looking glass

Picture 
this: 
a 
lazy 
Monday 

afternoon. I’m sitting on my couch in 
the 100 degree weather of Mumbai, 
India, scrolling through Twitter. Now, 
every few days, I’ll see the occasional 
insightful Tweet, but none stuck with 
me quite like this one:

“Gen Z will drink one medium 

caramel latte, not eat a single thing till 
4 p.m., verbally abuse a racist, crack 
a joke about their mental health and 
pick up a tear gas canister with their 
bare hands, but get nervous when 
they have to call to make a doctor’s 
appointment.”

As blunt as it is, the tweet’s author 

makes a valid point here: Gen Z 
is brave and unapologetic. Gen Z 
doesn’t take ifs, buts or maybes when 
it comes to something we believe in. 
Be it the Harry Potter community’s 
swift cancellation of its formerly-
beloved writer, or the collective anti-
European Super League outrage of 
soccer fans across the globe that had 
the highest-ranking officials in the 
sport quaking in their boots or the 
countless social media pages that 
try to amplify voices that need to be 
heard, Gen Z will stubbornly fight for 

what is right, even if it means turning 
against the things and people we love. 

And it’s not just about what is right 

for society, Gen Z-ers know what is 
right for us. Is it selfish to put your 
needs first sometimes? Absolutely 
not. It’s 2021 and mental health is at 
the forefront of our conversations — in 
large part due to Gen Z’s willingness 
to reject doing things that do not bring 
us happiness. That is what makes Gen 
Z such a force.

That being said, there are some 

things we just will not do and it is 
hilarious. So, inspired by my mystery 
twitter hero, here is The Michigan 
Daily’s Bucket List for Gen Z: a non-
exhaustive list of all the things Gen 
Z should be able to do, but simply 
cannot.

- Make a doctor’s appointment
- Send food back at a restaurant
- Use either Insta stories or Snap 

stories, but not both

- Drink water (Just five glasses a 

day, it’s not that difficult)

- Be into comic books and anime 

(It’s always one or the other, never 
both)

- Order black coffee
- Cope in ways other than comedy
- Delete TikTok for more than a 

week

- Wear a color other than black, 

white and grey (and the occasional 
navy blue)

- Not form an entire opinion around 

a topic upon learning the slightest 
thing about it

- Not make fun of Millennials
- Write a bad Yelp review
- Leave a below-20% tip
- Abstain from thrifting right after 

donating clothes

- Make a Spotify playlist without 

that one song (Yes I get it, Taylor 
Swift is amazing, but you can’t put 
“You Belong With Me” on a workout 
playlist)

- Have more than one go-to fast 

food chain

Now, 
these 
things 
seem 

straightforward — some of them 
are as mundane as tasks get. So, 
why can’t Gen Z do it? As a member 
of this fascinating generation, I’d 
probably lean towards the “we care 
too much about the sentiments of 
others” argument, but that answer 
seems way too simple. Members of 
older generations might resort to one 
of their many regular, anti-Gen Z 
complaints, including but not limited 
to: “They can’t take responsibility,” 
“They’ve had it too easy, they don’t 
want to get out of their comfort zone” 

or my personal favorite “Pfft, kids 
nowadays *cracks knuckles* they’ve 
gone soft.”

So, I don’t know. I don’t know why 

Gen Z hesitates from doing things well 
below their pay grade and seemingly 
included in a sane person’s comfort 
zone. It is intriguing and amusing, but 
I guess that could be said about a lot of 
things this generation does. 

What cannot be argued is that we 

keep you on your toes. With Gen Z, you 
never know what’s coming next. Gen 
Z will carry society into the future 
and I have no doubt that we will do a 
spectacular job. But I’d sleep a little 
easier knowing that our water intake 
is a bit more regular, “Sweet Caroline” 
doesn’t make it onto our “study music 
to focus” playlist and we can actually 
call the doctor when our friend’s knee 
pops out.

“Latte foam art. Tiny pumpkins. 

Fuzzy, comfy socks …”

Four 
months 
ago, 
comedian, 

musician, writer, actor and filmmaker 
Bo 
Burnham 
(“Promising 
Young 

Woman”) released “Inside.” Today, the 
internet is still grappling with how to 
feel about it. 

Unlike Burnham’s previous specials, 

“Inside” is more of a political art piece 
than a comedy. Subtle wit is done 
away with altogether, and in its place 
Burnham has created something that 
feels as crude and hopeless as being in 
quarantine during a global pandemic. 
And for the most part, his artistic 
transition from standup to existential 
fantasia has been met with applause.

However, there’s plenty of warranted 

criticism to be made about the tone 
Burnham employs while satirizing the 
hypocrisy of the digital age. Mainly, he 
can be guilty of the same performative 
activism 
that 
he 
condemns. 

Accordingly, it’s perfectly reasonable 
to find his patronizing attitude off-
putting. In fact, that’s exactly how I 
felt the first time I watched “White 
Woman’s 
Instagram”— 
a 
satirical 

music video from “Inside.”

The song pokes fun at shallow 

social media posts, commonly found 
on young, white women’s Instagram 
pages. At first, I wasn’t sure if the joke 
was funny enough to warrant what 
appeared, at the time, to be notes of 
misogyny. 

Yet, Gen Z seemed to embrace the 

song. I found it all over my TikTok feed 
the day after Burnham’s special was 
released, with many users joining in 
on the joke. It stuck with pop culture, 
and surprisingly, it stuck with me. 
Not because of its arrogant dismissal 
of white women, but because of the 
opposite:

Bo Burnham cares about why we, as 

a generation, can’t overcome our need 
to post content.

There’s a Bo Burnham interview 

that I always think about. In it, he 
talks about how young people right 
now are perceived as a “me, me, me” 
generation, when the truth is that 
it’s far sadder than that. For the first 
time in history, celebrities are no 
longer these massive icons on Mount 
Olympus. Thanks to social media, 
everyone is on a spectrum of celebrity, 
and by the time you reach middle 
school, you probably already know 
where you rank. 

Hence, every time a so-called “Gen 

Zer” feels the need to post about 
how much fun they’re having or who 
they’re hanging out with, they’re 
not screaming for attention. They’re 
begging for acceptance. 

“White 
Woman’s 
Instagram” 
is 

simply a caricature of this devastating, 
generational 
phenomenon 
put 
to 

music. This need for approval does 
not only impact women, of course, 
but throughout American history and 
beyond, it’s no secret that women 
have been forced to be aware of 
themselves in ways that men have 
not. Social media apps like Instagram 
and Tiktok are specifically designed 
to reward attractiveness — measured 
by standards that aren’t even human. 
As a result, the entire self-worth of 
teenagers right now is dependent on 
their ability to achieve likes in this 
twisted, virtual world. 

The 
insecurities 
of 
awkward 

13-year-olds are being tapped into 
in ways that previous generations 
couldn’t have imagined. Burnham later 
touches on this in his wonderfully-
sarcastic monologue:

“Maybe 
allowing 
giant, 
digital 

media corporations to exploit the 
neurochemical drama of our children 
for profit, you know, maybe that was 
a bad call by us. Maybe the flattening 
of 
the 
entire, 
subjective 
human 

experience into a lifeless exchange 

of value that benefits nobody except 
for, you know, a handful of bug-eyed 
salamanders in Silicon Valley … maybe 
that as a way of life, forever … maybe 
that’s not good.”

In “White Women’s Instagram” 

and several other “Inside” tracks, the 
world is a late-stage capitalist dystopia 
nearing its apocalypse. 

This is evident in Burnham’s song 

“That Funny Feeling,” where he lists 
off the strange contradictions of 
modern America — “Deadpool’s self-
awareness,” “Bugles’ take on race,” 
“stunning 8k resolution meditation 
app.” 
In 
our 
pursuit 
of 
human 

evolution, we can’t even tell the 
branded, virtual world from the real 
one. 

Understanding this context casts 

“White Women’s Instagram” in a 
whole different light. It’s not about the 
ridiculousness of white girls. It’s about 
the commodification of human life. 

“A novel,” “a couple holding hands,” 

“fresh fallen snow on the ground.” 
These are real, meaningful joys that 
life has to offer. Yet, instead of getting 
to experience them, the existence of 
social media has changed them into 
something else: a potential Instagram 
post. A chance to earn status. A piece 
of social currency. 

I cannot imagine something crueler 

to take from our generation than the 
simple beauties of the world. 

That’s not to say that in “White 

Women’s 
Instagram” 
and 
other 

tracks like it Burnham is being 
fully sympathetic to our generation. 
After all, he technically rests in the 
Millennial age range, and as a result, 
much of his criticism is directed 
toward individual shallowness and the 
loss of challenging art due to social 
media “aesthetics.” 

However, 
like 
all 
great 
satire, 

Burnham has a level of empathy here 
that makes the song so much heavier 
in significance than it seems on the 
surface. 

For 
instance: 
Throughout 
the 

majority 
of 
“White 
Woman’s 

Instagram,” black bars appear on 
either side to keep the images in a 
neat, square dimension, mimicking 
Instagram’s 
popularized 
format. 

About three quarters into the video, 
Burnham assumes a character who 
has lost her mother. As she speaks 
earnestly about her grief, the bars 
descend to the sides, depicting a shift 
away from the digital world and into 
a more honest, human one. Before 

she can get too sincere though, the 
bars come back, reconstructing the 
Instagram framing just in time for “a 
goat cheese salad!”

In this scene, Burnham challenges 

us to consider how social media 
compels us to prove our happiness to 
others. Rather than being able to face 
grief in a natural, healthy way, emotion 
is numbed through the forces of 
constant entertainment and artificial 
self-branding.

If it wasn’t clear already, I love the 

people of my generation. Growing up 
on the internet has made way for some 

of the most hilarious, well-informed, 
open-minded people in history. Yet 
my heart breaks for how anxious, 
insecure and straight-up depressed 
we have become due to our hunger 
for genuine human experience. 

I hope, perhaps with naivety, that 

these are just symptoms of being the 
first generation raised on iPhones. 
Maybe 
when 
Gen 
Zers 
become 

parents, our understanding of the 
internet’s true dangers will inform 
our kids in ways that our parents 

just 
didn’t 
have 
the 
experience 

to. However, American life under 
capitalism means that things will 
always keep going. Our children will 
likely grow up in new, virtual worlds 
that we aren’t able to comprehend — 
potentially ones even more dangerous 
than ours. 

I know that’s a pretty depressing 

note to end on, but keeping with 
the spirit of “Inside,” sometimes 
confronting the truth is a terrifying 
thing to do. If we want real change, 
we can’t keep chugging ahead. We 
need to slow down.

In the middle of a blue LED-

lit dorm room housing a gaggle of 
first-year girls, a phone blares the 
elementary ABCs. “Stand up if you’ve 
been with a J,” a girl yells when the 
letter passes over the phone’s screen. 
Every girl shoots up and poses for 
the video, collectively groaning about 
their romantic experiences with the 
stereotypical, thoughtless “J-named 
boy.”

TikTok 
trends 
like 
the 
“ABC 

hookup list” embody how Gen-Z 
girls are reclaiming their sexual and 
romantic lives. Similarly, Gen-Z girls 
post humiliating dating, flirting and 
hookup stories set to Seal’s “Crazy” 
and “Are they hot or are they just 
(insert adjective here)” videos — in 
which they illustrate the niche traits 
they find attractive in a love interest. 
By being honest on social media, 
recongizing both the triumphs and 
pitfalls of hook-ups and love, we erase 
the shame baked into the female 
experience. Thanks to TikTok, these 
conversations are broadcasted globally 
for girls to empathize with.

Older generations tell us what is “too 

mature” for our age and the media tells 
us what is “too prudish.” We are taught 
to laugh when Sandy wears both a 
long-sleeved cheer costume and a tight 
leather set in “Grease” and to sneer 
when Taylor Swift meets “yet another 
boyfriend.” Boys high-five their guy 
friends and stare at their girl friends 
when rumors about sexual encounters 
spread in the halls.

When society shames young women 

for their sexual or romantic histories, 
we internalize our struggles, desires 
and experiences as wrong or abnormal. 
If 
society 
were 
to 
destigmatize 

and recongize female sexual and 
romantic histories, we would be more 
equipped to accept and embrace our 
sexuality and ourselves. Until then, 
we are stuck in a vicious cycle, held to 
unattainable standards wherein sex 
and abstinence, being noncommittal 
and being romantic and fooling around 
and monogamy are all “wrong.” As we 
internalize these norms, nothing really 
feels “right.”

Teenage girls deserve an outlet to 

discuss their personal experiences 
with hookup culture. We find that 
outlet on Tiktok, where there is little 
shame in telling our story.

In dorms across the country, teen 

girls have been commiserating in each 
other’s romantic woes for decades. 
Digitization makes these conversations 
(set to music ranging from City Girls’ 
“Twerkulator” to the ABCs) more 

casual, open and funny — within the 
dorms and also on a global level. 

In TikTok trends like the “ABC 

hookup list,” girls blush as they stand 
for 26 letters or zero letters of the 
alphabet because others tell them it’s 

“too many” or “too few.” But within 
these small circles of laughing girls, 
removed from the pressures and 
expectations of what is “normal” for 
a teenage girl, there is no judgement. 
With secrets out in the open and set 
to a soundtrack of bouncy music, girls 
can have real, honest conversations. 
We can find solace in the fact that 
others go through the same things we 
do. We learn that sex and romance are 
personal, and we are all simply doing 
what is “right” for us. 

As my roommate stood for “M,” 

she told me about a high school crush 
who was far more than a crush. As 
I stood for “A,” I told her about my h 
sumiliating first kiss. We told each 
other we would look out for one another 
as we navigate college love with rose-
colored 
glasses. 
These 
lovestruck 

conversations are just as important as 
the basic roommate inquiries: “When 
do you go to bed?” and “What’s your 
favorite movie?” Tiktok started these 
conversations.

When 
Gen-Z 
looks 
back 
with 

horror at our old TikToks, I hope we 
can be proud that we worked toward 
destigmatizing love, sex and adolescent 
absurdity via a 30-second clip set to 
the ABCs.

Over the course of the past year, local 

and state governments have urgently 
declared racism as a public health crisis. 
On Aug. 5, 2020, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
signed an executive directive to this 
end and created the Black Leadership 
Advisory Council as an advisory capacity 
to develop and direct racially equitable 
policies and actions in Michigan. These 
declarations were long overdue, and both 
the COVID-19 pandemic and the surge 
in state-sanctioned violence in 2020 
brought to light the historical failures of 
our institutions which serve as a constant 
threat to the health of marginalized 
populations.

Health 
inequities, 
or 
systematic 

differences in the health status of certain 
population groups, are driven by social 
determinants of health. “Healthy People 
2020,” a federally supported prevention 
agenda, describes social determinants of 
health as “conditions in the environments 
in which people are born, live, learn, 
work, play, worship, and age that affect 
a wide range of health … outcomes and 
risks.” In other words, if an individual 
is born into a neighborhood that has 
poor access to health care, they do not 
have the appropriate means to maintain 
their health. These kinds of barriers are 
man-made, enforced by legislation that 
has been historically exclusionary. Thus, 
stark disparities across these factors 
must be traced back to their root cause: 
systemic racism.

Systemic racism is the foundation for 

the nation we live in today, but what does 
this ultimately mean for public health? 
What does this mean for future public 
health professionals as we strive toward 
a more equitable world for all? This 
past weekend, Public Health Awakened 
(PHA)’s Michigan Chapter hosted its 
first-ever public webinar promoting 
community education and engagement 
in a two-part series to discuss “Anti-
Racist Public Health: What it is, What it 
is not, and What it Could/Should be.”

PHA is a grassroots organization 

that came together in response to the 
2016 election. Since then, it has grown 
into a “national network of public 
health professionals organizing for 
health, equity and justice” — all the 
way from California to Washington, 
D.C., to Michigan. As a national project 
of 
Human 
Impact 
Partners, 
PHA 

focuses on incorporating the skills and 

backgrounds of its members as people in 
public health to social justice movements 
across the nation. Locally, the Michigan 
chapter has been actively involved 
in voting initiatives, harm reduction 
programs and the development of 
educational toolkits.

Importantly, PHA practices anti-

racist public health to move beyond 
performative measures and create true, 
lasting change. For the organization, 
this entails an explicitly abolitionist 
agenda, 
which 
involves 
conscious 

re-education and coalition building, as 
well as a transformation of prison and 
policing systems from the inside out. 
Chapter members Jannah Bierens and 
Vanessa Fry kicked off the first part of 
this series by discussing the importance 
of historical context when considering 
health today. By raising awareness of the 
dominant narratives that justify current 
policies, Bierens encouraged attendees 
to dig deeper into the root causes of 
population health.

“History does not end,” Bierens 

reflected, “If we don’t know our history 
… We are missing a large part of our 
narrative.”

Re-education 
demands 
critical 

analysis of past legislation and how 
it 
continues 
to 
affect 
population 

outcomes. For example, FDR’s New 
Deal aimed to stimulate the economy 
through mortgage loans, but this aid 
only extended to the white population. 
Ultimately, 
the 
federal 
program 

legitimized housing segregation and 
left predominantly Black neighborhoods 
divested 
from 
further 
widening 

the racial wealth gap. The policy’s 
aftermath is still present in cities today 
that have poor access to nutritious 
food, high exposure to pollution and 
unsustainable infrastructure for natural 
and man-made disasters. Addressing 
public health is acknowledging racist 
history and power dynamics. At its most 
fundamental level, holistic public health 
must be actively anti-racist.

In the second part of the series, PHA 

invited guest panelists Maria Thomas 
and Jordan X. Evans to speak about their 
fieldwork in a Q&A moderated by Jannah 
Bierens. Thomas is a public health 
activist who works with the Washtenaw 
County-based 
organization 
Liberate 

Don’t Incarcerate, whereas Evans is a 
racial equity consultant and Black Lives 
Matter organizer from Lansing.

It was so dark that I could barely see to 

the end of the driveway. The porch lights 
illuminated the chirping crickets and 
fireflies fluttering around. Eight-year-old me 
had no idea why my mom had interrupted 
my cartoons and dragged me and my brother 
outside in the middle of the night. My dad 
tried to light some candles but the frigid 
autumn wind kept blowing the flame out. 
When he finally managed to light them, 
we put them inside a bright red whale and 
butterfly lantern that dangled on a long 
plastic stick. I quickly forgot about how low 
the temperature outside had dropped as I 
ran around the driveway with the shining 
lantern and playing with sparklers. I still 
remember my mom watching me nervously, 
afraid I would fall and somehow catch on 
fire — which, knowing my klutziness, was, 
and still is, a likely possibility. At the time, 
I assumed that we were playing outside 
because it was Halloween or someone’s 
birthday, but as
 I know now, it was actually 

the Mid-Autumn
 Festival.

This celebration falls on the 15th day 

of the eighth month of the lunar calendar 
(Sept. 21 this year) and is also known as the 
Moon(cake) Festival or Lantern Festival. It is 
celebrated in Northeast Asian countries like 
China and South Korea as well as Southeast 
Asian countries like Malaysia and Singapore, 
where my parents are from. I have heard this 
day be referred to as “Chinese Thanksgiving,” 
but in reality, the two holidays have little 
in common aside from the time of year it is 
celebrated and family reunions.

There are many versions of the story 

behind this day, but the common retelling I 
learned is that the Earth was being scorched 
by 10 suns and no vegetation could grow. 
An archer named Hou Yi saved everyone by 
shooting down nine of the suns with a bow 
and arrow and was rewarded with the elixir 
of immortality. However, he didn’t want to 
live forever without his wife Chang E and 
gave the elixir to her for safekeeping. Hou Yi 
earned many followers for his bravery, but 
one of them found out about the elixir and 
attempted to steal it. Instead of letting him 
take it, Chang E drank the elixir herself and 
flew to the moon, the closest place to Earth 
in heaven. Hoping to someday reunite, he 
would present the moon with mooncakes 
every anniversary of that day. It is said that 
the full moon shines the brightest on this day.

Traditional mooncakes are typically 

round and golden-brown with ornate 

patterns stamped on top of them. During 
the Ming Dynasty in China, secret messages 
were hidden in mooncakes and used to 
pass information between resistance forces 
during an uprising against the royal court. 
Today, these pastries are typically filled with 
dried fruit, nuts, sweet red bean paste, white 
lotus paste or my favorite, green tea paste. 
Since the mooncakes tend to look identical 
from the outside (much to everyone’s 
annoyance), I remember sneakily taking bites 
out of several ones trying to find those filled 
with 
green 
tea 
paste 
and white lotus paste. 

Some mooncakes even have savory fillings 

such as Chinese sausage or radish. Other 
unique flavors I have come across include 
peanut butter, chocolate, ice cream and 
durian. When I was younger, I remember 
being offered ones filled with a salted egg 
yolk. To this day, I’m still not on board with 
this traditional flavor and will eat around the 
yolk when given one, but needless to say, this 
filling remains one of the most iconic today. 

Water caltrops, known as “lihng gok” in 

Chinese, are also associated with the Mid-
Autumn Festival. These bizarre-looking black 
nuts are boiled to become soft and reveal 
a white, slightly sweet nutty interior when 
peeled. This snack resembles a bat, which is 
considered auspicious because the Chinese 
character for the word “bat” is a homonym for 
the character of the word “prosperity.”

My family celebrates this day by enjoying a 

special dinner together. Every year, my mom 
wants family pictures with all the food and 
my dad repeatedly asks, “Can we eat yet?” 
My brother and I sneak food into our mouths 
when my mom isn’t looking. And there’s 
nothing quite like the coziness you get from 
being surrounded by steaming dishes when 
the weather is chilly outside. As far as I know, 
there is no one specific food associated with 
this meal like we would usually associate 
turkey with Thanksgiving. The main 
purpose is to reunite and enjoy each other’s 
company. My family in Malaysia will bring a 
table outside and put joss sticks and candles 
on it and pray to the moon. Neighbors will 
chat, enjoy mooncakes, drink tea and gaze at 
the moon together. Children will play with 
sparklers and bright red lanterns in animal 
shapes after it gets dark. My mom says that 
she remembers bringing in toilet paper rolls 
for arts and crafts time in school to make 
their own lanterns when she was growing 
up. People will barely be able to make each 
other out in the faint moonlight, but you can 
hear laughter and chatter for miles.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

27 How some taxes 

I spent much of my adolescence in a locked-

in, exhausting, clawing, screaming one-sided 
war with Taylor Swift in the same way I had 
spent much of my childhood in the same kind 
of battle with the color pink. Taylor Swift sings 
about boys too much and Taylor Swift lied 
about Kanye West and Taylor Swift makes 
music for little girls and for girls that can’t 
throw and for girls that worry about breaking 
their nails, and I’m just not that kind of girl you 
know? I don’t worry about breaking my nails 
and I wear blue jeans and did you know I don’t 
own even a single dress and I retch and gag 
every single time one of her songs come on the 
radio and scream CHANGE THE STATION 
my EARS are BLEEDING mostly because 
I don’t like myself. And perhaps more than 
anything else, it was a raging, crawling sort of 
sick, a crippling envy, an aggressive jealousy 
that fueled the war I began with myself and 
by extension, Taylor Swift, because I felt like a 
huge, gaping fraud every single time I listened 
to her.

Understand 
that 
when 
you 
have 

never been allowed to be a woman, your 
womanhood is no longer an inherent part of 
yourself, but rather, it becomes a commodity, 
something meant to be bought and traded, 
stolen and taken from you against your 
will. It is put up to trial and dangled in your 
face as an untouchable, convoluted sort of 
construct a million times over, so that in time 
it becomes easier to reject the very notion of 
being a woman rather than dig and dig until 
your palms weather down to the bone, beg 
for penance and sell your dignity in search 
for a reason why. Womanhood no longer 
belongs to you, no longer presents itself as 
immovable, unshakable, tangible, something 
wholly and unequivocally yours in the same 
way you own shoes, or your nose, or your 
work or your words. Know that when you 
take away ownership of womanhood, you 
take everything attached to it, you take 
innocence and care, you take grace and 
love, you take the spine, so that soon you are 
denied existence as any kind of woman, a 
loud-mouthed woman, a stubborn woman, a 
greedy woman, a woman that likes the color 
purple so much she painted the kitchen lilac 
and the living room lavender and the dining 
room violet. Things become harder and 
flawed, infinitely more difficult to navigate 
after the fact — because womanhood has 
never been as simple as a derivation of the 
physical body. To lack in this way, or more 
so, to be made aware of this lack and to be 
treated as if you are a problem for asking 
for more, to be treated as if you are the very 

antithesis of anything feminine and a thorn 
in a million and one sides, a chewed-up pen 
cap underfoot, is to become dead while 
you’re alive. And instead, anger, grief, volatile 
pain are directed at women like Taylor Swift 
because she is everything you have never 
been and everything you have never been 
allowed to be. 

In healing, reckoning and reconciling 

with yourself are perhaps the most difficult 
tasks. You begin to lead a gritty, rock-hard, 
mucky existence fraught with disbelief so 
that livid rage turns spite into grief because 
to heal is to recognize that you were never 
an angry woman but you were a grieving 
woman, in grief over all the things that were 
taken from you, and the kind of woman you 
could’ve been and the kind of woman you 
could be if the way you loved and the way 
you were loved was anything other than 
what it was. And to write about it is the 
most assertive thing one can do and where 
do you go from here after letting the world 
know? Where to start and where to begin 
and how to tie everything back together, and 
do you stitch it up or do you pack it deep in 
a cardboard box and bury it under the time 
capsule in your backyard or do you give it to 
the wind or tie it to the sort of special balloon 
that could break the sky?

And more than anything else, in healing, 

the answer lies with Taylor Swift. 

I didn’t like Taylor Swift for many reasons. 

First, because I didn’t like country music and 
then because I didn’t like pop music and 
then because I didn’t like her Reputation Era 
because who writes an entire album in the 
deep dark sewers of social cancellation after 
being subsequently canceled and Kanye and 
Kim were right and she was wrong. I didn’t 

like Taylor Swift because I thought she didn’t 
make music for women with one foot here 
and the other over there, women who existed 
in the ill-conceived derivation of purgatory 
that comes with feeling not enough of 
something and too much of something else, 
women that wrestled and fought and begged 
for space and understanding and humility 
and to be taken as they were, and mostly, 
for women like me. I didn’t like Taylor Swift 
because I didn’t like me. It’s easier to find 
flaws in a woman like Taylor Swift than to 
ever question why you found them, why 
you picked at them, had your fingers ready 
to unravel snags in every album she had 
ever put forth or her fanbase or her lyrics. 
It’s easy because she’s Taylor Swift and she 
won’t hear a word you say or ever put you in 
your place except she’s Taylor Swift and she’s 
been questioned and ripped apart not just by 
you, but the whole world so much that either 
people rabidly love her or hate her. 

I listened to Taylor Swift for the first 

time in seven years a month before my 
19th birthday. Her lyrical genius was 
mesmerizing, fantastical, so extraordinarily 
well put together that I’d counter Taylor 
Swift is a writer before she ever is a singer. 
 

Her albums are never an “open and shut” 
case, but rather an evergreen testament to 
the sort of love and outrage that we never 
seem to forget because nothing is over until 
it’s really over. I understand now what it 
means to truly listen to Taylor Swift and to 
not feel like a liar or a phony or a fake in doing 
so, in knowing that she too, has had to piece 
herself back together and that to heal is to 
listen to Taylor Swift and feel like enough, 
and mostly, to love yourself to the moon and 
to Saturn.

At twilight, when the fulgent glow 

of the setting sun flickers with fleeting 
fatality, I often find solace in setting 
out, stride by stride, for a nice evening 
walk. It’s a wander of wonder. Sunsets, 
after all, in their evocation of quiet 
contemplation of celestial creation, 
alter our sense of time, making us 
meditate on meaning, prompting us to 
ponder our plight, as the night falls and 
the death of the day is at bay. 

Walking, for those of us who are able 

to do so, is an exercise of enormous 
spiritual potential, allowing us to view 
the vitality of all things around us as 
we meander through this monumental 
macrocosm of material existence. We 
might be prone to see walking as a 
rather arbitrary activity, devoid of any 
divine details, yet this could not be 
further from the Truth. 

In her book “Wanderlust: A History 

of Walking,” Rebecca Solnit describes 
walking as “the most obvious and 
the most obscure thing in the world, 
this walking that wanders so readily 
into religion, philosophy, landscape, 
urban policy, anatomy, allegory, and 
heartbreak.”

Many of us have profound childhood 

memories 
of 
walks. 
I 
still 
hold 

memories of walking through the busy 
Toronto streets on my dad’s shoulders 
at age 4, moving through the Detroit 
Riverwalk with my grandparents at age 
8 and tirelessly trekking to the bus stop 
every day at age 12. I recall the regular 
route I would take in typical teenage 
trepidation, as I trampled my way 
around corners in the cold at 6 a.m. Even 
now, I vividly maintain the memories of 
those early rises — moving with haste 
(dressing with no taste), cheap wired 
headphones on, show tunes in my ear 

going off. Those early morning walks 
were a hallmark struggle of my middle 
and early high school years. Yet they 
remain key moments in my attempts 
to mitigate my adolescent anxiety as I 
anticipated the fateful day(s) ahead. 

When we walk, there is a continuum 

of choices to be decided upon, as events 
quickly unfold much like the unwinding 
path before us. One misstep has the 
power to create major complications 
with its implications. Enchanted by the 
allure of detour we may find ourselves 
under the dictates of fate as our 
footsteps lead us astray, but ultimately 
on the way to new people and places, 
destinies and dooms.

On our walks we encounter a mirage 

of faces and fits, with a flash of sonder 
following, as we ponder the rich and 
intricate lives of those we meet on 
the streets. Walking gives way to a 
tension found in the perception of 
the self and the perceiving of others. 
An assortment of vessels enters into 
our vicinity. Eye contact, in passing, 
evokes an evanescent intimacy. We 
cross paths with close friends, new 
crushes and old flames as separated 
souls synchronizing, meshing in the 
moment, only to diverge in dissolution 
and disarray. 

Walking also carries with it a great 

particularity. We become attached to 
certain paths, certain locations and 
taking a certain path to those locations 
at specific times of day. Walking a 
favored or familiar path can evoke 
an eeriness — a numinous nostalgia 
within us as we reminisce on our 
earlier encounters in those spaces. I go 
to the Arb, and I’m reminded of all the 
instances I’ve traversed the very trail — 
day and night, alone or with company, 
sober or well …

By Andrew Nakamura, MiC Columnist

My perfect morning goes like this: 

I’m awake at least two hours before any 
commitment, class or meeting. I pour 
myself a glass of water and make a cup of 
coffee. I drink my coffee while snacking 
on almond-stuffed dates for energy. I 
change into my running clothes, slip 
on my shoes and make sure I use the 
bathroom. I stretch, put in my Airpods, 
hit play on my Spotify playlist and take 
off to the “start workout” command 
from my MapMyRun App. With my back 
straight, my shoulders pinched back 
and my elbows bent and stationary at 
my side, I start running. My feet hit the 
pavement one after the other, while my 
shoulders move in synchrony with my 
legs. Right shoulder with left leg. Left 
shoulder with right leg. My breathing 
soon follows as I get into a pattern 
matching my strides. Just like that, I 
enter a meditative state. With drum 
beats blasting through my ears, my feet 
against the pavement and my breathing 
steady, my mind is at peace. I feel 
gratitude in running, pride that I am a 
runner and dedication to make this run 
a meaningful one. I am interrupted only 
by my phone announcing the distance 
and speed at which I am running. It’s 
one of my favorite feelings in the world. 
Back at home, I quickly get myself 
into the shower hearing my brother’s 
“Leen you smell so bad” and my sister’s 
slightly kinder “Were you running?” 
with a hand over her nose. For the rest 
of the day, I carry a certain openness in 
my 
chest and lightness in 
my step. 

I absolutely love running. Yes, I 

am one of those people. I’m not very 
good at it, but I love it. Running has 
been an integral part of my life for the 
greater part of three years. Anyone 
who only knew me before that would 
be astonished that I am a runner. I 
tried running track in high school and 
quit after two weeks thinking that 
running was not for me. But during 
the winter semester of my sophomore 
year of college, I came across a video 
of a woman challenging herself to train 
for a marathon in 10 weeks. There was 
something very inspiring about the 
mental strength needed to train for 
and run a marathon. The runner in the 
video had trained her mind as much 
as her body to fully prepare herself. I 
remember texting my friend “I want to 
do that,” and with that text, my running 
journey started. 

For the past two and a half years, 

I have continuously fallen further in 
love with running. It got me through 
quarantining, 
MCAT 
studying, 

family arguing and countless other 
challenges. Having made it through 
those challenges and reflected on those 
experiences, I have learned a lot about 
myself through running. Here, I wish to 
share some of those lessons: 

Lesson number 1: You don’t have to 
be the best at something to claim it as 

yours.

I became a runner the moment I 

decided to put on my shoes and leave 
the house. I have come across many 
runners who don’t claim this status 
until they’ve reached a certain mileage 
or pace. To me, it does not matter how 
fast you are running or how far you 
go. If you run, you’re a runner. It was 
important to rid myself of expectations 
that force me to reject activities I deem 
myself not good enough at. Because of 
this lesson, running has opened many 
doors for me. Picking up running as 
a hobby has allowed me to pick up 
painting as a hobby as well. Nothing I 
paint could sell at a museum but that 
has never stopped me from picking up 
my brush. This brings me to my next 
lesson. 

Lesson number 2: Anyone can run, All 
you need are running shoes.

There are countless guides on the 

internet discussing which running 
shoes to buy. For me, I bought my first 
pair off the clearance rack at Marshall’s. 
Only after getting to long distances did 
I start using orthotic inserts from my 
doctor. Those same shoes stayed with 
me until my 18-mile run before I finally 
switched them out. 

Lesson number 3: Caffeine and good 
music can help 

Part of the reason that running is fun 

for me is the music I listen to. Research 
has shown that music can boost 
preparation for, performance during 
and recovery after a run. Multiple 
studies have found that listening to 
music can ease the effort exerted during 
running. When it comes to caffeine’s 
effect — both physically and cognitively 
— on athletes, the scientific community 
is in overwhelming agreement that it 
can improve performance and speed 
during runs as well as help recover 
muscles and enhance circulation after 
runs. 

Lesson number 4: You are a lot 
stronger than you think

During periods of intense physical 

activity, our bodies resort to anaerobic 
respiration, or the production of energy 
without the use of oxygen, to generate 
the energy we need. During anaerobic 
respiration, a mixture of compounds 
builds up in the muscles exerting 
activity. In 2014, researchers at the 
University of Utah injected that same 
mixture into human subjects’ resting 
thumbs. Without exerting any effort, 
their thumbs started to feel tired, achy 
and even shake. The researchers found 
that these metabolites activate neurons 
that give our muscles the sensation of 
pain and fatigue even when they are in 
perfect condition to keep exerting.

I think about that study every 

time I am struggling to push myself, 
whether it’s on a run or off. Without 
fail, I have always gained the reward of 
achieving a task I didn’t think I could 
do. When training for a marathon, 
after completing my 6-mile run, I knew 

that I could hit any distance I set my 
mind to. Every time I thought to stop, 
I reminded myself that I had completed 
a 6-mile run so I could do anything. 
If I am strong enough to run all this 
mileage, then I am strong enough to 
finish this homework assignment, have 
that dreadful conversation or ask for 
help. 

Lesson number 5: Running is not 
pretty

On any given run, I have sweat, 

mucus, spit and sometimes dead bugs 
on my face. If I have a nose bleed on a 
run, there is blood. If it’s a particularly 
emotional or difficult run, there are 
tears. My face gets red and my frown 
lines begin to show. I am in fight 
mode. Pushing yourself past what you 
think you can do is never pretty. It is 
exhausting, ugly and uncomfortable. 
But when I make it to the other side, 
the reward and the confidence gained 
from my accomplishment makes all the 
trouble worth it. 

Lesson number 6: No one can take 
that strength away from you

Once you realize lessons 4 and 5, 

you possess something that is yours 
and yours only. No matter what is 
happening in my life, when I put on my 
shoes and get out the door, I can block 
all of it out even if for just the duration 
of my run. The strength that allows 
me to run beyond my comfort is the 
same strength I carry with me in every 
challenge and that is something nobody 
else has access to but me. 

Lesson number 7: Every uphill is 
followed by a downhill

I think every runner develops an 

intuition to detect uphills. No matter 
how fit I am, uphill running is a lot 

more difficult and to be avoided at all 
costs. However, what gets me through 
each uphill jog is my certainty that 
a downhill will emerge. It gives me 
comfort that my agony will end, no 
matter how long it lasts and a well-
earned downhill will follow. I hold 
on to this principle whenever I am 
experiencing adversity — it is only a 
matter of time until it is over and I get 
to enjoy the ride down. 

Lesson number 8: Your mental health 
is intrinsically linked to your physical 
health

Many studies I have mentioned 

explore the differences in performance 
when we trick our brains to work 
harder and run further demonstrating 
the great impact our minds have on our 
bodies. 

Though people generally associate 

runner’s high with the rush of euphoria 
following 
activity, 
recent 
research 

has found that runner’s high is caused 
by receptors in the endocannabinoid 
system. These receptors are present 
in 
the 
lungs, 
kidneys 
and 
bone 

marrow 
and 
affect 
your 
immune 

response, reproductive health and pain 
modulation. Not only does runner’s high 
affect our mind and feelings, but it is 
intrinsically connected to our physical 
health. In my experience, running helps 
my mental health in the same way that 
meditation does and I feel much better 
after my runs. However, there have 
been days when I have had to skip a run 
because I was losing confidence in my 
ability to perform. Which brings me to 
my next lesson. 

Lesson 
number
 
9: Knowing 
and 

listening to your body is key to 
successful running

I 
cannot 
emphasize 
this 
point 

enough. Learning when to test your 
limits and when to rest is one of the 
most fundamental skills to build as a 
runner. It is absolutely necessary to 
continuously acknowledge cues from 
your body and mind as to how you are 
doing and trusting the messages they 
are sending. Research can guide us in 
learning what our bodies are doing at 
different points during our training but 
establishing that knowledge needs to 
happen on an individual level. Learning 
about and trusting my body allows 
me to put up boundaries and set goals 
better suited to my abilities. 

Lesson 
number 
10: 
The 
most 

important part of a fitness journey is 
finding a workout you enjoy

If you have been on TikTok or 

Instagram reels recently, you have 
seen videos that preach discipline over 
motivation. I agree with the sentiment 
— discipline establishes a regimen 
that takes the thinking out of making 
choices. Discipline allows me to run 
the number of times a week that I do; 
however, it makes a very big difference 
when I wake up excited to run and give 
it my all. It’s not to say that I have never 
dreaded a run and in those moments 
when motivation is lost, discipline 
keeps me running. On and off the 
running course, a balance of discipline 
and motivation is essential for growth. 

***At the end of this article, I would 

like to acknowledge the privilege 
allowed to me as a white-passing 
woman of color that allows me to 
pursue running as a hobby. I want to 
remember and honor Ahmaud Arbery, 
Mollie Tibbetts, Karina Vetrano and the 
countless other people who have been 
killed while running due to racism, 
sexism and other forms of bigotry.

What the walk reveals


7-Opinion

O

ver the last few decades, 
climate 
change 
and 

pollution have become an 

ever-increasing cause of concern due 
to the threats they pose, be it floods, 
hurricanes, habitat destruction or 
any number of natural disasters. Due 
to this increasing concern, there’s 
been a huge push for individuals to 
cut down on their personal impact. 
This can be seen everywhere with 
initiatives like Save the Turtles, the 
increasing popularity of electric cars 
and many advertisements generally 
pushing for people to decrease both 
their waste and carbon emissions. 

This is fantastic; living in a cleaner 

and more environmentally friendly 
world is something that positively 
impacts every aspect of our life. But 
the tendency to push the blame for 
climate change and pollution onto 
individuals is not only wrong but 
intentionally malicious on the part 
of massive energy and fossil fuel 
companies, the entities truly at fault.

This last year has shown many 

just how devastating the coming 
climate crisis will be, be it the floods 
in Louisiana and New York, or the 
“hell portal” that came as the result 
of a ruptured pipeline. These events 
underscore just how dire the fight 
against climate change is and sadly 
how individuals really can’t do 
much to help. This is because the 
vast majority of global emissions are 
created by just a small handful of 
fossil fuel and energy corporations. 

To be more exact, around 71% 

of global emissions are put out by 
just 100 different companies. This 
number makes one thing very clear: 
it is up to these corporations and the 
governments that regulate them, not 
individuals, to curb climate change. 

The issue is that historically, 

strong enough action hasn’t been 
taken. Fossil fuel companies always 
look after their own interests, and 

then they pay politicians to support 
them as well. What this means is 
that before society can even think 
about stopping climate change, 
there must be a total shift in how 
both governments and businesses 
operate. First, companies must be 
held fully accountable for every 
single bit of carbon emissions and 
pollution that they create, and the 
only way to do this is to completely 
rework how lobbying and corporate 
interest are structured, both in 
America and around the world. Big 
oil has a stranglehold on American 
democracy, and this greed will soon 
destroy the entire world.

Some 
may 
argue 
that 
the 

only 
reason 
these 
businesses 

are producing emissions is that 
individuals create the demand for 
it. People drive cars that use fossil 
fuels, use lights and devices that 
use electricity and wear clothes that 

create far more emissions than one 
might expect. While this argument 
is partially true, many of these 
emissions come from attempts to 
make production as convenient as 
possible for these corporations: A 
purposeful lack of research into 
renewable energy makes fossil fuels 
a much more convenient form of 
energy for production. This two-
pronged issue could be solved by 
implementing stronger regulations 

on energy production and increasing 
funding for research into renewable 
energy.

While 
corporations 
are 
the 

drivers of climate change, this 
does not mean that the average 
person can’t do anything to combat 
it. First, people can try to live as 
carbon neutral as possible, either 
by using motorized vehicles less 
frequently, eating less beef or using 
less electricity. But an even greater 
way to help is to strongly advocate 
for the solutions that will create an 
even more significant change. This 
can include protesting, directly 
contacting public officials or doing 
public outreach. 

While a massive portion of global 

emissions and pollution does not 
come from individuals, there is still 
a lot of work to be done by those 
same individuals to save the world 
from a global crisis. People must be 

vigilant in changing institutions and 
systems that have let the world get 
this close to the brink of a complete 
climate disaster in order to stop the 
corporations that have done it. 

While it may already be too late 

to completely keep the world from 
seeing the damaging effects of 
climate change, everyone must be 
involved in making sure it doesn’t 
get any worse, especially those at the 
top.

O

n Sept. 2, the University 
of Michigan hosted the 
first of a series of meetings 

of 
the 
Michigan 
Independent 

Citizens Redistricting Commission 
(MICRC) held at college campuses 
around the state. These meetings 
are intended to offer a space for 
Michigan residents to voice their 
perspectives on the state’s ongoing 
nonpartisan redistricting process.

MICRC was first instituted 

in 2018 following the approval 
of 
Proposal 
2 
by 
Michigan 

voters. The proposal took the 
power 
of 
redistricting 
away 

from the state legislature and 
placed it in the hands of an 
independent commission, which 
now has the authority from the 
Michigan Constitution to redraw 
congressional and state legislative 
districts. This redistricting cycle 
is the first in Michigan to be led by 
an independent commission, and 
many other states have already 
instituted similar commissions to 
lead nonpartisan redistricting.

Proposal 
2 
was 
intended 
to 
reduce 

gerrymandering 
in 
Michigan, 

something 
that 
historically 

prevented 
Michiganders 
from 

being accurately represented in 
Congress and the state legislature. 
It is commendable that Michigan 
voters in 2018 recognized that the 
quality of our democracy would 
improve if a nonpartisan entity 
was in control of redistricting. 
But even though Michigan took 
this major step toward ending 
gerrymandering, many other states 
still allow their state legislatures to 
control congressional redistricting.

Gerrymandering aims to divide 

voters in a way that favors the 
party in charge. It does this in two 

ways: Legislators either pack the 
opposing party’s supporters into as 
few districts as possible or divide 
them into many districts to prevent 
them from gaining a majority in 
those districts. While there are 
general guidelines for redistricting 
— 
including 
compactness, 

preservation 
of 
communities’ 

boundaries and contiguity — states 
often ignore these guidelines when 
redistricting. 

This can lead to oddly shaped 

districts, 
such 
as 
Maryland’s 

third 
congressional 
district, 

which a federal judge said was 
“reminiscent of a broken-winged 
pterodactyl.” 
Some 
of 
these 

obscenely gerrymandered districts 
led to lawsuits that forced states to 
draw new maps prior to mandatory 
redistricting after the 2020 census.

It is understandable why partisan 

state 
legislatures 
gerrymander; 

parties want to give themselves the 
best possible chance to win seats, 
and legislators who draw these 
maps want to protect themselves 
and their seats as well. But this 
partisan practice gravely harms 
democracy in the United States. 
Any steps taken to intentionally 
prevent voters from having their 
voices heard in government is an 
insult to democracy.

It is important to note that 

gerrymandering is not a partisan 
issue — both parties do it. Currently, 
two of the most gerrymandered 
states in the U.S. are Maryland and 
North Carolina, whose legislatures 
were respectively controlled by 
Democrats and Republicans, in 
2011. Both states intentionally 
gerrymandered for their party’s 
gain, causing each party to gain 
additional seats in their states 
relative to the vote share of each 
party. North Carolina was so badly 
gerrymandered that in 2017 the 
U.S. Supreme Court ordered the 

state to draw new districts in 2017.

There are two ways to prevent 

partisan bodies from drawing 
district lines. One is for the federal 
government to ban gerrymandering 
through legislation. The For the 
People Act, or H.R.1, attempts to 
do just that; but, it will likely fail 
to pass in the Senate. The Supreme 
Court could also act, but recently 
“ruled that lawsuits over partisan 
gerrymandering raise a political 
question that is beyond the reach 
of the federal courts,” according to 
The Hill.

This leaves the decision to the 

states, which is far less promising. 
A federal law or Supreme Court 
decision would force every state 
to comply rather than leaving it to 
state lawmakers or asking citizens 
to organize ballot initiatives. There 
is little incentive for lawmakers to 
ban gerrymandering themselves. 
But it must be done to ensure 
American 
elections 
accurately 

represent the voice of the people.

However, 
eliminating 

gerrymandering would not solve 
the 
whole 
problem. 
Because 

Democrats are tightly packed 
in cities large and small, and 
Republicans tend to be more spread 
out, it is difficult to draw districts 
that adequately reflect the vote 
share in states. 

While ending gerrymandering 

would not completely eliminate 
the problems in our democracy, it 
must be done to ensure as equal 
representation as possible at the 
state and federal levels. The current 
system in many states, in which 
partisan legislatures draw the maps 
of their own districts, encourages 
politicians to play dirty. A mandate 
to end gerrymandering, either 
from the state or federal level, 
would allow Americans to be fairly 
represented and would allow their 
voices to be heard.

T

he United States recently 
mourned 
the 
20th 

anniversary of one of 

the largest and most destructive 
terrorist attacks in history — 
the Sept. 11 attacks on the Twin 
Towers. Ever since that attack in 
2001, 9/11 has remained a fixture 
in the American ethos and foreign 
policy. Former President George W. 
Bush launched the “War on Terror,” 
forever changing the geopolitical 
landscape of the Middle East. 

Carnage followed, with nearly 

900,000 civilians in the region 
killed, alongside 38 million people 
displaced. The terror attacks on 
this country were indeed terrible; 
I make no pretensions to the 
contrary. But the ensuing chaos and 
destruction has been incalculable. 
When President Bush first declared 
the War on Terror, he said “America 
and our friends and allies join 
with all those who want peace and 
security in the world, and we stand 
together to win the war against 
terrorism.” Despite that rhetoric, 
this ‘War on Terror’ brought no 
peace or security to the Middle 
East.

The first target of America’s 

wrath 
was 
Afghanistan. 
The 

United States asked the Islamic 
Emirate of Afghanistan, operated 
by the Taliban (whose existence 
can be blamed on the United States 
— a topic I wrote about here), to 
extradite Osama bin Laden. The 
latter denied this request, so the 
U.S. invaded. 

The Taliban were temporarily 

pushed back, and the U.S. propped 
up its own administration. The 
U.S. wreaked havoc in the country 
after failing to find bin Laden and 
continued to do so even after finding 
him. The most recent example of 
this was the failed airstrike on Aug. 
29, killing 10 innocent civilians. 

Other targets included Yemen, 

which the U.S. has been drone-
striking for nearly two decades. The 
number of strikes in total is 374, 
with civilian deaths numbering up 
to 150. While President Joe Biden 
hasn’t himself launched a strike 
against Yemen, he continues to 
support Saudi Arabia’s invasion of 
the country despite promising not 
to do so.

Another war started by the 

United States was the invasion of 
Iraq in 2003, in which the U.S. armed 
forces and other allies overthrew 
Saddam Hussein’s government. This 
particular conflict was based on 
allegations that the Hussein regime 
was developing weapons of mass 
destruction, such as chemical or 
nuclear weapons. 

The evidence for this was 

completely 
fabricated, 
and 
the 

U.S. entered into a conflict based 
on lies. Saddam Hussein did not 
have weapons of mass destruction. 
After the U.S. severely damaged 
the country, it left in 2011. It then 
re-entered Iraq in 2014 to combat 
the rise of ISIL, which itself formed 
as a splinter group of al-Qaida after 
the initial U.S. invasion.

Despite these two major invasions 

— among many more — one glaring 
hypocrisy stands out: U.S. politicians’ 
refusal to examine the possibility 

of the Saudi Arabian government’s 
involvement in the 9/11 attacks. 

If we really wanted to hold the 

perpetrators of 9/11 responsible, 
we would’ve taken action against 
the Saudi oligarchs who allegedly 
funded 
the 
operation. 
Rather 

than actually doing that, though, 
president after president let the 
autocratic regime continue without 
punishment due to the U.S.’s 
favorable relations based on oil and 
their strategic importance in the 
Middle East. 

Recently, 
President 
Biden 

declassified an FBI report that 
details the relationship between 
Saudi nationals and the hijackers. 
Osama bin Laden himself was 
connected to the wealthy Saudi 
family, and 15 of the 19 hijackers 
were from Saudi Arabia. Saudi 
Arabia is also the center of 
Wahhabism, 
a 
fundamentalist 

movement in Islam funded by the 
House of Saud. Al-Qaida and ISIL 
were both founded on the principles 
of this extremist ideology.

The United States wreaked havoc 

upon the Middle East, whether 
through intentional maliciousness 
or unintended consequences. We 
used the deaths of 2,997 people 
on 9/11 to justify the slaughter of 
hundreds of thousands more. 

The government has abused the 

memory of the deceased to justify 
their own conflicts, whether it be 
for oil, war profiteering or other 
imperialist machinations. In the 
wake of 9/11, two decades later, the 
smoldering ruins of the twin towers 
loom large in American memory. 

The subsequent 20 years of 

destruction ought to as well.

E

instein wasn’t a genius. 
Neither was Mozart, nor was 
Beethoven. 

But society’s brilliant masterminds 

and superhuman performers share 
one thing in common: a spark that 
ignited their soul and lit an eternal fire 
under their rear.

Let me explain.
Innate genius is not a new concept. 

Homer credited the greatness of 
composer and singer Demodocus to 
divine gifts in the “Odyssey” nearly 
three millennia ago: “Call in the 
inspired bard Demodocus. God has 
given the man the gift of song.” In 
1790, philosopher Immanuel Kant 
argued in “Critique of Judgement” 
that artistic genius was of “nature’s 
elect,” a “natural endowment.” 

Today’s media continues to reason 

that skill is derived from innate 
talent, fueling the romanticization 
of “genius.” Netflix’s most-watched 
limited series, “The Queen’s Gambit” 
(which boasted 62 million viewers 
within its first 28 days) tells an 
alluring story of an orphaned chess 
genius conquering a male-dominated 
industry while processing the effects 
of mental illness and addiction. 
Similarly, “The Imitation Game” 
featuring 
the 
legendary 
WWII 

cryptanalyst Alan Turing grossed 
more than $200 million worldwide 
and won the Academy Award for best-
adapted screenplay.

Vogue’s piece “Why Are We So 

Obsessed With Geniuses on Film?” 
entertains the idea that we are averse 
to the ordinary. The dichotomy of 
wanting to be extraordinary while 
simultaneously 
maintaining 
its 

impossibility — the lust for something 
we can’t have — ties us to the myth 
of genius. Genius entertains and 
mystifies us. More dangerously, it has 
the potential to limit us. 

The summer before I began my 

college 
applications, 
I 
pondered 

whether to continue studying the 
piano (the longest and biggest love 
of my life) or to pursue a liberal arts 
education and discover an academic 
interest (that holds more job security). 
Since the age of six, I had dreamed of 
holding the stage as an internationally 
touring concert pianist and painting 
stories and feelings through music, 
but I questioned my talents compared 
to the sea of child geniuses that 
surrounded me. A part of me felt 
like I was too normal; I didn’t have 
the “something special” that could 
make me one in a million. I wondered 

if this period of rumination was a 
moment where I could reaffirm my 
commitment to music or if I was just 
delusional to consider the odds. 

I signed up for a class called 

“Deliberate Practice” that month. 
During the first session, my instructor 
put up a portrait of violinist and 
philosopher Shinichi Suzuki on the 
screen. Beside him, a quote that I can’t 
fully recall, but that stuck with me. In 
Suzuki’s “Nurtured by Love,” though, 
he writes, “There is no such thing as 
natural ability, no such thing as a child 
born without talent. … Talent is not 
inherited or inborn, but learned and 
trained. ‘Genius’ is an honorific name 
given to those who are brought up and 
trained to high ability.”

Today, there are mountains of 

accumulating 
modern 
research 

falsifying ancient philosophers’ theories 
and demystifying the age-old social 
construct of genius. One of the greatest 
studies is Cambridge University Press’ 
2006 publication, “The Cambridge 
Handbook of Expertise and Expert 
Performance.” The 900 plus-page 
handbook 
includes 
contributions 

from more than 100 leading scientists 
on expertise and top performance 
in surgery, acting, chess, writing, 
computer programming, ballet, music, 
aviation, firefighting and more. 

The real magic is not genius; it’s 

the marriage of three components: 
intrinsic 
motivation, 
deliberate 

practice and expert coaching. 

Daniel Coyle’s book “The Talent 

Code” explains that results are 
tangible in a neural circuit insulator 
called myelin, a layer of fatty tissue 
that accumulates whenever someone 
focuses 
intensely 
on 
a 
specific 

circuit corresponding to a specific 
skill; with more myelin layers, signal 
strength becomes stronger, faster and 
more accurate — ultimately building 
skill.

Some great works I found in my 

research were: “The Making of an 
Expert,” “The Role of Deliberate 
Practice in the Acquisition of Expert 
Performance,” The Talent Code, 
Talent is Overrated and Deep Work. 
Here is what I gathered on three of 
history’s mammoth figures:

Golf giant Sam Snead insists 

on telling a different narrative of 
“naturals” than those assumed by 
popular lore: “People always said I 
had a natural swing. They thought 
I wasn’t a hard worker. But when I 
was young, I’d play and practice all 
day, then practice more at night by 
my car’s headlights. My hands bled. 
Nobody worked harder at golf than 
I did.” Snead echoes researchers’ 
findings that deliberate practice is 

not inherently enjoyable, though 
ultimately rewarding.

Mozart — who began composing 

from the young age of five, gave public 
piano and violin performances at 
eight and produced some of Western 
culture’s greatest masterpieces by 
35 — is the leading counterargument 
to the anti-talent thesis. Here’s my 
response: Wolfgang’s father, Leopold 
Mozart, was a composer, performer 
and widely-acclaimed pedagogue. 

The original “tennis father and 

tiger mama,” Leopold demanded 
intensive training in composition 
and performing from 3-year-old 
Wolfgang as a way to improve his 
family’s fortune, claiming “Wolfgang’s 
good fortune and success will be 
our sweetest revenge” (written by 
Leopold in “The Letters of Mozart 
and His Family”). As for young 
Wolfgang’s compositions, “Talent is 
Overrated” notes that his manuscripts 
were suspiciously written in the 
hand of his father, and as a teen, his 
pieces were often rearrangements of 
other composers, including Johann 
Sebastian 
Bach 
(often 
regarded 

as the father of classical music), 
whom Wolfgang studied with in 
London. Today, Wolfgang’s first real 
masterpiece is said to be his Piano 
Concerto No. 9, composed at the age 
of 21 — the result of eighteen years 
of deliberate practice and intense 
coaching. 

When teenage Benjamin Franklin, a 

primary school dropout, endeavored to 
improve his writing, his method did not 
depend on passive reading. Rather, he 
dissected issues of the popular British 
publication The Spectator, and days 
later, practiced reconstructing them 
from memory, matching subtle hints 
in sentiment and expression. Franklin 
would then compare his version of The 
Spectator with the original and correct 
his faults. He sharpened weaknesses 
in vocabulary and variety in prose 
by translating articles into rhyming 
verse then verse back into prose — the 
mentally demanding work of deliberate 
practice.

Despite modern research and 

historical accounts which aim to 
loosen the media’s grip on the notion 
of the born-genius, we are slow to 
change long-held and deep-rooted 
beliefs, and it is only hurting society 
and its progress.

I urge you not to bow your head 

under the ceiling of “genius.” Ask 
yourself not, “Am I good enough?” 
but, “Am I willing to do the work?” 
Ignite your soul with an obsession — 
only that can fuel tireless, unending 
willpower to learn and become better. 
Rage to master.

Consulting is huge at Michigan 

— the job prospect is so popular 
and widespread that it’s even 
designated its own season. From 
August to November, a large 
section of the student body is 
busy sending out their resumes, 
getting in touch with alumni and 
practicing for interviews. 

When recruiters from major 

firms hold events on campus 
— most commonly in the Ross 
School of Business or Blau Hall 
(the University of Michigan’s 
premier 
business 
hubs) 
— 

students flock to auditoriums 
just to shake their hands. The 
goal is to network your way into 
an interview and prepare for 
possible “case” questions they 
could throw at you — tests on 
scenarios you might have to face 
at their firm. Students say, all-in-
all, it’s like adding another class 
load’s worth of work to your 
semester. But by Halloween, 
you 
start 
hearing 
about 

people signing with Deloitte 
or McKinsey & Company; by 
Thanksgiving break, the dust 
has all but settled. Everyone 
can hang up their suits until the 
summer when they either start 
the internship or start the whole 

process over again. 

Despite all the stress and the 

work, the formula of consulting 
is apparently a part of its appeal: 
There’s a clearly outlined path to 
success if you’re willing to play 
by the rules. And if you’re lucky, 
at the end of the summer, there’s 
the all-important return offer. 

I’m a senior in the Ford School 

of Public Policy, and while it’s not 
the primary avenue public policy 
students take after graduation, 
consulting is always on the table. 
Around this time of year, my 
career counselor starts sending 
out emails about information 
sessions, consulting workshops 
and case demonstrations. 

While I have never been 

actively interested in consulting, 
there was a time where I was 
at least mildly intrigued by the 
prospect. Working on projects 
for short periods of time with 
people approximately your own 
age — it sort of sounded like 
school. Ultimately, I decided I 
didn’t want to do something so 
closely tied to business (partially 
because I do math at an eighth-
grade level and partially because 
I want to do something more 
creative) and didn’t take it any 
further. 

I was eight when I first discovered 

fire in my brain. 

In the gentle lull of summer, 

I awoke to a vice-like pain in my 
head, which slowly bloomed into 
a throbbing metronome directly 
behind my eyes. I yelled for my mom, 
who promptly provided Advil and 
water, neither of which did anything 
to curb the pain. I curled my body in 
a ball, wedged my head between two 
pillows and sobbed. The better part 
of eight hours passed, after which my 
weary second-grade self succumbed 
to exhaustion and fell asleep. 

My parents have never been the 

type to make a trip to the doctor 
without serious cause; anything short 
of leprosy or spontaneous combustion 
was merely a chance to “tough it out.” 
Hence, when my mother booked 
me a doctor’s appointment the next 
morning, it was a surprise to all of us. 
It was my first indication that we were 
in uncharted territory; something 
severe and mysterious crept about 
the fringes of the horizon. We entered 
the quaint Vermont clinic as zombies 
might, weary from last night’s 
episode. Nonetheless, we knew what 

I experienced was serious, and we 
were determined to figure out both 
what was wrong and how to fix it. 

It would take several doctor’s 

appointments, an MRI and an EEG 
(the process of attaching electrodes 
to the scalp to detect electrical 
activity in the brain) to gain any 
clarity on the issue at hand. In the 
spirit of medical ambiguity, there 
was good news and there was 
bad news. It would appear that 
I suffered from migraines. This 
was the good news, I suppose. It 
would also appear that there was 
no discernible cure in sight. There 
were medications, treatments and 
prevention methods,but I would 
likely experience these headaches 
for the rest of my life. 

The fire in my brain burned gently 

and steadily. Most days it was tame, 
docile even. Then, without warning: 
an inferno. There was no rhyme or 
reason to it, it consumed when it saw 
fit and dissipated as unexpectedly 
as it blazed. I quickly learned that 
the science behind migraines is 
conjecture at best. They may be the 
result of a faulty vascular system. 
Or perhaps a chemical imbalance. 
No, maybe it’s all due to some 
underlying central nervous disorder. 
The hypotheses are numerous and 
varied, all culminating in a truth as 
frustrating as it is elusive.

No one knows for sure.
As I grew older, the headaches 

worsened, often brought on by the 
hormonal shifts that accompanied 
adolescence. They evolved from mere 
headaches to full-on neurological 
disasters. I developed migraines 
with aura; in addition to the splitting 
head pains, I experienced visual and 
tactile disorientation. It was staring 
into the very center of a lightbulb for 
10 seconds straight. A host of glaring, 
glowing specks reappeared with 
every blink, clouding my field of 
vision. Yet unlike the fleeting blows 

of a lightbulb, these malignant blips 
refused to abate. They expanded, 
consuming my line of sight, sending 
my sense of depth perception topsy 
turvy. They persisted for hours, 
needling their way into my eyes, 
skull and brain.

With the visual aura came its 

equally destructive sister, the tactile 
aura. She brushed your fingertips 
with a gentle tingling sensation, 
which gradually rippled throughout 
one half of your entire body. Half 
of your face, chest, hands and feet, 
completely devoid of sensation. You 
try to drink a glass of water, read, 
enter a lit room, all to no avail. You 
try to push through it, stick it out, 
only to find yourself vomiting in the 
middle school nurse’s office, one 
hand grasping the wrapper of a pill 
that didn’t work, the other limp with 
numbness. One side of your head 
blazes, the other feels nothing at all.

Despite the mystery surrounding 

chronic migraines, every doctor you 
visit will encourage you to identify 
your triggers. They are multitudinous 
and ubiquitous. Anything from 
preservatives 
to 
changes 
in 

barometric pressure can set one-off. 
I was put on a number of elimination 
diets, changed my sleep schedule 
entirely and cut out caffeine. I did all 
in my power, and the migraines rolled 
in all the same.

Unlike many, I’ve had the good 

fortune of sporadic and infrequent 
migraines for the most part. In my 

adult life, I only deal with a serious 
migraine every two or three months. 
As a kid, I was less lucky. In addition 
to my migraines, I’ve dealt with 
anxiety for my entire life, which I’ve 
since identified as one of my primary 
neurological triggers. I now have 

the autonomy to get the treatment I 
need to mitigate the adverse effects 
of mental and physical illness. I have 
the tools I need to adapt to life with 
migraines. But they came at a cost. 
In my senior year of high school, my 
anxiety was at an all-time high. By 
the final semester, I found myself 
waking up to a migraine nearly every 
day. I couldn’t read, study or even 
walk around without help. I was 
constantly nauseous, and the pain 
was excruciating. My grade point 
average plummeted, and my absences 
put me at risk of not graduating.

I didn’t expect it when the 

trailer for the third season of 
“Sex Education” showed up in 
my Youtube recommended feed. 
I didn’t expect the plunging 
feeling of longing and sadness that 
followed either. 

The show had been a godsend 

during my freshman year of 
college, getting me through my 
first and only winter on the East 
Coast before I transferred to 
the University of Michigan. The 
connection also carried into my 
sophomore year at the University, 
as it was also a touchstone of 
friendship between myself and the 
group of friends I became close 
with when I arrived in Ann Arbor. 
And though a year had passed since 
the release of the show’s second 
season, when the long-anticipated 
third season was announced, I 
had immediately texted my friend 
group. I couldn’t wait to spend days 
and nights watching the season 
together. 

But 
between 
the 
initial 

announcement and the trailer, my 
friend group fell apart. By now, the 
season has premiered and I still 
haven’t even watched the trailer.

***
While I don’t watch a ton of 

movies, I consume television and 
other forms of media far more than 
I’d like to admit. If you looked at 
any of my “continue watching” 
pages on any streaming platform, 
you’d see everything from “Kim’s 
Convenience” to “Outlander” to 
“Castlevania.” There are shows 
like “Schitt’s Creek” and “Peaky 
Blinders” that I’ve rewatched 
countless times in their entirety. 
There are even shows in Norwegian 
and Spanish sitting on my “to 
watch” list. 

My tastes, when it comes to 

shows, vary drastically, which is 
why I use them as a way to connect 
with people. It’s very easy to talk 
to someone you hardly know when 
you both can quote every single 

line 
from 
a 

Jack Whitehall comedy special 

or make an obscure reference to 
“Travels with my Father.”

“What other comedians do you 

like?”

“Have 
you 
watched 
‘Elder 

Millennial’?”

“Have you gotten to the second 

season of *insert any sitcom here* 
yet?”

Conversations 
spark 
and 

friendships ignite. To some people, 
this may seem incredibly natural 
— of course, that’s how you start 
a conversation — but when you’ve 
struggled with social anxiety and 
panic at the idea of speaking with 
other students in a class, good 
small talk topics feel like currency. 
And sometimes that’s someone 
referencing a show you just finished 
watching and being able to play off 
of their words.

***
In the fall of 2019, the Doc 

Marten-clad girl who helped me 
move into my residence hall after 
my parents left (with hardly more 
than a wave goodbye) texted me. 
It had been several weeks since 
move-in, and she and I, along with 
two other girls from our dorm, had 
become fast friends, sharing the 
intimate details of our personal 
lives as if we’d all been close for 
years.

One night she told me that 

she was having a panic attack 
— something both of us were 
intimately acquainted with. Both 
of our coping strategies typically 
consisted of distracting ourselves 
until they ended. So, I went to 
her room, and we put on the most 
distracting thing we could think 
of: an episode of “The Marvelous 
Mrs. Maisel,” a show we had 
collectively seen too many times 
to count. The plan was a success, 
and after this night, the remedy 
became a tradition. Any time either 
of us had a bad day, we’d go to one 
of our rooms, eat cookies and put on 
something familiar to watch.

But then the pandemic made it 

impossible to do such a thing. We 
were sent home and had to readjust 
to life without each other. 

At the start, my group of friends 

tried our best to keep in contact. 
We had an ever-running group chat 

filled 
with 

dog 
photos 
and 

laments over our baking fails 
or rants about how our professors 
decided to assign us more work 
than usual because everything 
had gone virtual. A few nights we 
even tried a group FaceTime and 
I introduced them to my sisters. 
Those conversations tapered off, 
though, until the threads grew 
silent.

We all returned to campus 

the next fall, but something had 
changed. The girl who I’d seen 
through panic attacks and who’d 
seen me through depressive spirals 
hardly ever spoke to me anymore, 
and when she did it was short and 
clipped conversations.

Maybe we just grew apart. 

Maybe this was inevitable. Maybe it 
was how deeply rooted my religious 
trauma is and how she was a born-
again believer. Maybe it was the fact 
that her family was wealthier than 
I could ever dream of being, and 
I finally couldn’t keep comparing 
myself to her. Whatever the case, 
there grew a rigid and lengthy 
distance between us. And though 
we tried to watch the last season of 
“Schitt’s Creek” together, we never 
made it past the third episode. 

After several months of not 

speaking but not exactly disliking 
each other, I could keep going back 
to the shows we watched together. 
I tried to laugh at the jokes in “The 
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” the same 
way I once did. Now, thinking about 
the show at all makes me deflate 
a bit inside. I haven’t watched a 
comedy special in months, not 
when they were the first thing 
she and I bonded over. Now that 
that bond is gone, looking back at 
the connections and memories we 
shared over these shows only hurts.

I have not been able to bring 

myself back to “Schitt’s Creek,” and 
the very thought of watching an 
episode of it ever again makes me 
feel a little sick.

***
No one told me I could go to 

graduate school, not until I started 
doing research my junior year of 
college and my mentor told me that 
if I was even considering it, I should 

start 
thinking 
about writing 

a thesis. I very quickly realized that 
my linguistics major wasn’t going 
to get me as far as I wanted in life 
unless I pursued a higher degree. 
I knew I needed to find something 
I could write 30-ish pages on and 
actually be excited about.

Luckily, I quickly uncovered 

my topic of interest in the Mid-
Atlantic/Trans-Atlantic 
accent, 

more 
particularly, 
modern 

representations of it. Think of all 
the characters in the first episode 
of “WandaVision,” or Effie Trinket 
in “The Hunger Games.” Or, think 
about what became my main focus: 
Moira Rose in “Schitt’s Creek.” I 
had pages of analysis planned out in 
my head for Moira Rose, examining 
the way Catherine O’Hara seemed 
to mimic the high-class, most 
desirable, 
golden 
standard 
of 

speech from a bygone era while 
bringing an element of comedy 
to it. I had thought through the 
socio-linguistic implications of her 
dialectic patterns and what it said 
about speech standards in television 
today. I considered its comparison to 
the images of Old Hollywood.

I had it all planned out. But then 

the summer came and went, and a 

friendship 

fell 
apart, 

and 
the 
thought 
of 

objectively examining a piece of 

media that I had such an emotional 
connection to became something I 
simply couldn’t bring myself to do. 

At a school like the University 

of Michigan, it’s not uncommon 
for students to put their academics 
ahead of their mental health — 
I’ve certainly done it. But this just 
wasn’t something I could justify. 
I wasn’t going to risk throwing 
myself into a depressive spiral over 
a paper. It just wasn’t worth it.

***
For now, “Schitt’s Creek” sits in 

my “watch again” tab in my Netflix 
account, along with so many other 
shows I once loved but now can 
never go back to. I’m too sentimental 
to delete them from my watch 
history — possibly for the same 
reasons I collect text messages.

When 
the 
“new 
episodes” 

notification came up for “Sex 
Education,” I wasn’t able to ignore 
the way it made my chest clench. It 
didn’t stop the impulse I felt to pick 
up my phone and text the friend I 
had once planned to watch it with.

And I don’t think I’ll ever watch 

these episodes.

In the same way,I don’t think 

I’ll ever be able to watch the final 
seasons of “Peaky Blinders” when 

they 

are released because of 
the 

inside jokes I shared with my group 
of friends about that show. Even 
the idea of watching the last few 
episodes of “Lucifer” makes me feel 
uneasy because that was the first 
show my friends and I watched 
together after quarantine. 

***
In the weeks since my circle of 

friends splintered, I’ve found myself 
gravitating more and more towards 
media that no one else I know 
watches. Movies I hold close to 
myself and tell nearly no one about 
out of fear they’ll uncover some part 
of me and judge me by the stories I 
love. I’ve discovered new TV shows 
that I watch by myself on weekends, 
silently enjoying the fan culture 
ever-present and easily accessible 
on social media. No one knows the 
kinds of music I listen to, or the 
books I read anymore — those I keep 
strictly to myself out of fear that 
connecting them to relationships 
could ruin them for me.

There is a value in sharing 

these kinds of media or forms 
of art with other people: It can 
establish an easy connection, a 
bridge in an otherwise awkward 
conversation. But maybe there’s 
also value in keeping it to ourselves; 
loving something because it is 
authentically ours, undiluted by the 
fragility of relationships around us.

On Saturday, the Michigan 

football team’s offense limped 
through a scoreless second half 
against Rutgers. While the Scarlet 
Knights stymied the Wolverines’ 
rushing attack, junior quarterback 
Cade McNamara wilted, throwing 
for just seven yards across the final 
two quarters. 

Still, two days later, Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh offered a 
positive review of McNamara’s 
performance. 

“For the most part, I thought he 

was pretty darn good,” Harbaugh 
said.

McNamara’s first half, which 

included 156 passing yards and 
sustained two touchdown drives, 
was exceptional and made the 
late-game miscues all the more 
surprising. 

Speaking after practice on 

Monday, 
McNamara 
faulted 

Michigan’s 
offensive 
attrition 

on a lack of momentum. With 
four consecutive three-and-outs 
to begin the second half, the 
Wolverines was unable to develop 
any sort of rhythm. 

Having watched the film of his 

performance, McNamara wouldn’t 
concede whether the root of his 
problems were more footwork-
related or mechanical-based. He 
did, however, acknowledge that he 
rushed a few throws, including a 
would-be touchdown in the final 
seconds of the first half, when 
he missed senior tight end Luke 
Schoonmaker in the corner of the 
endzone. 

Heading into a pivotal matchup 

against Wisconsin, McNamara 
remains confident in the passing 
game, in spite of the struggles.

“I think throughout the season, 

our intermediate stuff has been 
really good,” McNamara said. 
“We’ve thrown it deep in the 
game (and) we’ve been able to do 
that really well, so I think we’re 
building.

“... 
When 
we’re 
in 
those 

scenarios where we have to throw 

our way back into a game, I think 
I’m more than capable of doing 
that.”

The Badgers will certainly test 

that declaration. Through four 
games, the Wolverines’ passing 
game has played second fiddle to 
their rushing attack, averaging the 
second-fewest passing yards per 
game in the Big Ten. When Rutgers 
stacked the box with an eighth 
player, McNamara and company 
could not engineer the offense by 
themselves. For the first time this 
season, the opposition successfully 
carried out a gameplan to stop 
Michigan’s offense. 

Wisconsin, which boasts the 

top rushing defense in the Big Ten, 
seems well-equipped to follow 
that blueprint themselves. 

“Really stout, really good,” 

Harbaugh said of the Badger 
defense. “Guys that have played a 
lot of football. Experienced, solid, 
physical, athletic defense that 
knows the scheme and they’re 
very dialed in.” 

That unit will place McNamara 

further 
underneath 
the 

microscope. 
Still, 
Michigan’s 

second half woes cannot solely be 
attributed to McNamara — suspect 
playcalling and the receivers, who 
dropped several catchable balls, 
are equally to blame. But, the 
Wolverines’ fate may very well 
hinge on McNamara’s ability to 
develop a consistent passing game 
and establish the momentum that 
he lamented. 

It’s a task made more difficult 

by 
the 
raucous 
environment 

inside Camp Randall — not only 
has Madison emerged as a house 
of horrors for the Wolverines in 
recent years, but McNamara is yet 
to play a road game in front of fans, 
a byproduct of the pandemic. 

“Overall, I’m gonna have to do 

a better job, or really just a louder 
job, of communicating whatever 
the protection is or whatever I’m 
asked to do,” McNamara said. 
“Just me being louder, whether 
that’s doing stuff with more 
signals, we’ll see, but I’m ready for 
the challenge.” 

After 
senior 
kicker 
Jake 

Moody missed a 47-yard attempt 
to 
put 
the 

game on ice, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
took 

the 
field. 

Again. 

With 
the 

Wolverine 
offense 
struggling 
to 
make 

an 
impact, 

Rutgers’s time of possession 
skyrocketed 
in 
the 
second 

half, totalling 17:42 of 30 total 
minutes. Now, with a chance to 
drive down and tie, or win, the 
game, the Scarlet Knights could 
take their momentum and drive 
past a weary defense.

Instead, 
junior 
linebacker 

David Ojabo executed a spin 
move 
and 
stripped 
Noah 

Vedral, the ball ricocheting into 
freshman 
linebacker 
Junior 

Colson’s arms. A worn down 
defense found a stop. Michigan 
would win. 

“(It was a) gritty game,” 

Harbaugh said after the game. 
“It wasn’t pretty. But when they 
make a space for pretty on the 
scoreboard, then we’ll worry 
about that.”

There are a lot of lessons to 

take from a game where the 
Wolverines 
beat 
Rutgers 
by 

one score and totaled just 47 
yards of offense in the second 
half, drawing out fans and their 
shovels. 
But 
Michigan 
still 

won. It executed when it had 
to, sucking down time with an 
eight play, 33 yard drive (the only 
non-three-and-out of the half) 
and coming up with that crucial 
turnover. 

Not every team can do that. 

Look at Iowa State, or Clemson 
or Wisconsin. None of those 
teams executed when the time 
called for it.

“I think we had a positive 

attitude throughout the whole 
game, through all the ups and 
downs,” junior defensive tackle 
Christopher Hinton said. “ I 
really like that about the defense 
and this team this year. We’ve 
just got to keep that rolling 
because every game is not going 
to be sunshine and rainbows. 
We’ve just got to stay stout in 
tough times.”

Good teams win games, and 

this weekend the Wolverines 
won.

At least, they’re probably good 

enough to match pre-season 
expectations, maybe more. A 
20-13 win over Rutgers may not 
be too flashy, but it shows that 
even with poor performances, 
Michigan can put together a win. 
And that’s promising. 

Consider the 2015 Michigan 

State team, which scraped by 
every game it won and did so 
in 
an 
incredibly 
frustrating 

fashion. But that team made the 
College Football Playoff while 
looking not impressive in any 
way. 

Or consider Nebraska, who’s 

found increasingly funny ways 
to lose this year, always close 
but never finding the final 
push. Or Iowa State faltering 
and floundering to match the 
mountains of expectation heaped 
on them. Winning is a skill and a 
very difficult one to master. But 
once you figure out how to do it, 
it can carry you through rough 
patches like Saturday. 

Next weekend, we’ll see if 

this Michigan team has really 
learned how to win. It’ll face 
a Badgers team that failed to 
execute against Notre Dame and 
is now having the question asked 
of whether they can beat good 
teams.

“As a team, we’re not doing 

enough to give ourselves a chance 
to win and to beat good football 
teams,” Wisconsin coach Paul 
Chryst said after losing to Notre 
Dame. “That’s something that 
we’ve obviously got to improve 
upon, and everyone’s got to find 
a way to move forward.”

Wisconsin will pose a huge 

challenge, regardless of how 
it’s performed so far. It’s a 
program that’s used to winning 
and knows how to do it, unlike 
Rutgers.

The Badgers will target the 

weaknesses 
the 
Wolverines 

showed Saturday, but Michigan 
has shown an ability to create 

explosive plays through both 
the air and the run. In the first 
half, junior quarterback Cade 
McNamara showed what fans 
had wanted to see — he aired it 
out and found holes, doing what 
the fanbase desperately hoped 
he could.

And the defense, who, despite 

being repeatedly forced into 
difficult 
situations, 
stopped 

the Scarlet Knights when it 
mattered most. A fourth down 
stop, a missed field goal and a 
fumble are no small tasks. 

Fans shouldn’t be too scared, 

with shovels in hand to bury 
their hopes again. In the team’s 
first big battle of the season 
it showed an ability to work 
through the pain, something 
that was foreign last year. 
Disappointment will, for now, 
wait a little longer: maybe just 
one week, maybe until the 
Wolverines go to East Lansing. 

SportsMonday: Don’t bury Michigan yet

EMMA MATI/Daily 

Michigan’s victory Saturday showed it’s capable of grinding out tough wins.

Michigan faces first bout of 

adversity

When greeted with adversity 

for the first time in the 2021 
season, the Michigan football 
team emerged unscathed. 

For 
three 
weeks, 
the 

Wolverines 
coasted 
to 

comfortable 
victories 
by 

double-digit margins. Neither 
Western Michigan, Washington 
nor Northern Illinois proved 
capable of slowing down their 
potent rushing attack. 

That feel-good success came 

to a screeching halt Saturday 
against Rutgers. And yet, in 
spite of a furious comeback 
attempt by the Scarlet Knights, 
Michigan proved victorious.

Whereas 
the 
Wolverines 

simply 
collapsed 
in 
similar 

situations last season, 2021 is 
thus far telling a different story. 

“I think as a team, we didn’t 

flinch 
at 
all,” 
sophomore 

linebacker Nikhai Hill-Green 
said. 
“Offense, 
they 
know 

they’re going to clean their stuff 
up, but I feel they didn’t flinch, 
they did what they could do, and 
we did what we could do. We 
didn’t flinch at all and we got 
the win.”

Junior 
defensive 
tackle 

Chris Hinton maintained that 

the team remained poised and 
positive on the sidelines, even 
amid the persistent struggles. 
It’s a mentality that first formed 
during spring ball. 

“We just preached through 

the offseason, keep grinding 
through whatever, don’t flinch,” 
Hinton said. “Take the punches 
and respond when we need to.” 

Games 
like 
Michigan’s 

contest with Rutgers could 
serve 
as 
a 
launching 
pad 

moving forward. The success, 
particularly in contrast to last 
season’s failures, also points 
to the refined culture that the 
Wolverines constructed over 
the offseason. 

“Every game’s not going to 

be sunshine and rainbows,” 
Hinton said. “We just have to 
stay stout in tough times.” 

Ross injury forces others to 

step up 

Through 
the 
first 
half, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
held 

Rutgers’s 
offense 
in 
check, 

allowing only a field goal. 
Fifth-year 
linebacker 
Josh 

Ross 
was 
integral 
to 
that 

effort, contributing six tackles, 
including two tackles for a loss. 

But Ross left the game late 

in the second quarter with a 
“stinger” injury and did not 
return. In his absence, the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
proved 

increasingly 
vulnerable, 

allowing a series of prolonged 
drives and turning a blowout 
into a nail biter. 

With 
Ross 
sidelined, 

freshman 
linebacker 
Junior 

Colson played alongside Hill-
Green, 
while 
sophomore 

linebacker Kalel Mullings also 
saw an increase in playing time. 
Colson racked up six tackles, 
while 
Mullings 
recorded 

five. Hill-Green, meanwhile, 
notched eight tackles and keyed 
a series of late-game stops 
that squashed a late Rutgers 
comeback. 

“We practice situations like 

that all the time in practice,” 
Hill-Green said after the game, 
noting 
that 
Michigan 
had 

prepared for a similar scenario. 
“When your number’s called, 
you’re ready and do your job 
and step up to the plate. That’s 
what Junior Colson did; that’s 
when Kalel Mullings did. I’m 
super proud of those guys.” 

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh said following the 
game that Ross is “going to 
be okay,” mentioning that he 
didn’t 
regain 
the 
requisite 

strength to be cleared following 
the injury. While it appears the 
injury isn’t serious, losing Ross 
for an extended stretch of time 
would be a sizable blow for the 
Wolverines’ defense. 

Offensive 
shortcomings 

hamper defense

The ineptitude of Michigan’s 

offense on Saturday triggered 
a 
two-pronged 
effect. 
Four 

consecutive 
three-and-outs 

to begin the second half wore 
down a nicked-up Wolverine 
defense, subsequently fueling 
a Rutgers offense that had 
previously been listless. 

After the game, Harbaugh 

conceded 
that 
fatigue 

had 
influenced 
the 
unit’s 

performance. 

“I think that’s part of it,” 

Harbaugh said. “That many 
three-and-outs, that’s gonna be 

a factor. Those kinds of things 
stacked up against them. (They 
were) on the field too much.” 

Through 
the 
first 
three 

games of the season, fatigue 
hardly mattered, considering 
the fact that the starters were 
often pulled from the game early 
in the third quarter. But, it’s a 
situation that will likely repeat 
itself later in the season against 
more formidable opponents. 

First-year 
defensive 

coordinator Mike Macdonald 
likes to rotate through swaths 
of players as a way to keep them 
fresh, a strategy that stands in 

contrast to Don Brown’s former 
scheme. 
On 
Saturday, 
the 

Wolverines rotated defensive 
line packages, pairing fifth-year 
Donovan Jeter with sophomore 
Kris Jenkins and junior Mazi 
Smith alongside Hinton. The 
secondary and edge rushers 
also shuffled through players 
with 
sophomore 
defensive 

back Jordan Morant and senior 
defensive 
lineman 
Julius 

Welschof seeing the field. 

Macdonald’s tactic figures 

to bode well moving forward, 
when fatigue inevitably emerges 
as a variable.

Front row improvements spur 
Michigan past Michigan State

The 
No. 
18 
Michigan 

women’s soccer team found 
itself in a place it has been 
three times this season: tied 
at the end of regulation. The 
Wolverines (7-1-2 overall, 1-0-1 
Big Ten) battled Wisconsin 
(7-1-3, 2-0-1) for 90 minutes, 
but 
staunch 
defense 
and 

limited offensive opportunities 
on both sides forced the game 
to overtime. 

After a lackluster first 90 

minutes, the two overtime 
periods offered both teams 
a chance to gain momentum 
and muster out a win. But the 
defensive stalemate continued, 
forcing the game to a scoreless 
tie. 

Although 
Michigan 
has 

plenty of overtime experience, 
it could not channel that into a 
win, settling for one point in a 
highly contested Big Ten. 

“Our league is really really 

difficult,” 
Michigan 
coach 

Jennifer Klein said. “Every 
team is going to be tough. Every 
game is going to be a battle and 
they’re going to push you to the 
very, very end. ... I think overall 
it’s just we’re getting a point on 
the board today which is really 
key for us within the league.” 

Michigan entered the game 

averaging over 23 shots per 
game, fifth best in the country. 
However, 
throughout 
the 

game, the Wolverines found 
themselves searching for shots 
on 
goal. 
Senior 
midfielder 

Meredith 
Haakenson 
took 

the first shot for Michigan 16 
minutes into the game. The 
Wolverines only forced the 
Badgers to make one save 
throughout the game and never 
produced any real offensive 
pressure. 

Despite 
junior 
defender 

Jayde 
Riviere’s 
breakaway 

speed 
and 
superior 
ball 

handling, she never created 
enough separation to deliver 
a 
good 
shot. 
This 
was 

emblematic of the rest of the 
team’s struggles to get good 
chances in front of the goal. 
The Wolverines had 13 shots 
and only one on goal, a far 
cry from their usual average. 
This was the second game this 
season Michigan has failed to 
score, despite notching a clean 
sheet for the fifth time. 

Given 
the 
sparing 
shots 

on both sides, neither team 
gained any real momentum 
throughout 
the 
game. 
The 

Wolverines controlled the ball 
in the midfield and in their 
offensive third for the majority 
of the game, but Wisconsin’s 
defense thwarted any offensive 
attacks.

“Wisconsin’s a gritty team,” 

fifth-year goalkeeper Hillary 
Beall said. “They’ve always 
been a gritty team. I think 
that they just bring that extra 
step when we play them. Their 
energy is pretty good.”

Michigan’s defense was a 

key part of why the Badgers 
never scored. Wisconsin also 
managed only one shot on goal, 
with 10 shots in total. The ball 
was cleared out of the Badgers’ 
offensive third quickly and 
efficiently 
throughout 
the 

game. 

“I think our centerbacks 

did 
a 
phenomenal 
job 
of 

stepping up and really getting 
in there with grit,” Beall said. 
“(Graduate 
defender) 
Alia 

Martin and (senior defender) 
Sydney Shepherd played high 
top. I’m so grateful to have 
them back there.”

The 
Wolverines 
relied 

on their depth, consistently 
rotating players in. The team 
returned all of its starters 
from last season, enabling it 
to jell quickly and get off to a 
good start thus far. This helped 
the team withstand the 110 
minutes of gritty soccer. 

“Something that we’ve been 

preaching to our team is that 
we are a team very fortunate 
with depth,” Klein said. “...
We were able to keep going, 
put players on, try to rotate. 
I think it allowed us to keep 
the momentum and push, just 
unfortunate that we didn’t get 
a goal today.”

Michigan’s depth was tested 

in the first overtime period 
when Riviere took a hard hit to 
the head. Wisconsin midfielder 
Emma Jaskaniec received a 
yellow card for the hit and 
Riviere did not return to the 
game. 

“Jayde is a player who 

is 
always 
going 
to 
bring 

something special when she’s 
on 
the 
field,” 
Klein 
said. 

“Whether it’s just her tactical 
ability or her ability within, 
speed and everything like that. 
When you lose that player it 
definitely 
takes 
something 

away, but I am still really proud 
of the players that we put on.”

The most exciting action 

came 
during 
the 
second 

overtime 
period 
when 
the 

Badgers took three consecutive 
corner 
kicks. 
Each 
time, 

the Wolverines stacked the 
box and cleared the ball out 
successfully. 

Down their best player and 

having already played 100-plus 
minutes, Michigan looked to 
have ceded the momentum. 
Still, the Wolverines held their 
ground and didn’t allow a goal 
despite three close calls. They 
took a possibly game-changing 
set of plays to force the 
momentum back to their side. 

With the offense sputtering, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
played 

a pivotal role, allowing the 
Wolverines to muster out a 
point. 

“We’re in the hunt for a Big 

Ten 
Championship,” 
Beall 

said. “We didn’t drop a game, 
we obviously got a point out 
of it. Definitely defensively 
killing it the past few games. 
Defending, we’re just doing 
great and I think if we can get 
on the board we’re going to be 
really great.”

‘M’ battles to scoreless draw

LILY ISRAEL

Daily Sports Writer

Down 24-23 in the second set, 

sophomore outside hitter Jess 
Mruzik stepped up to serve. 
She took a deep breath, tossed 
the ball up and promptly hit it 
into the tape. As the ball came 
crashing down to the ground, a 
look of disappointment washed 
over the Michigan players’ 
faces. After cutting an 11-point 
deficit to one, the issues that 
had plagued the Wolverine’s 
outside hitters early in Sunday’s 
match returned to cost them. 

Plenty 
of 
hitting 
errors 

stemming 
from 
Michigan’s 

outside hitters, combined with 
inefficient blocking, constantly 
put the Wolverines behind 
early in sets. It didn’t help that 
Michigan State outside hitter 
Sarah Franklin rarely missed 

her kills early on, further 
highlighting the issues on the 
Michigan front row. 

But 
despite 
early-set 

struggles, 
the 
Wolverine’s 

front swung momentum back in 
their direction. Led by Mruzik 
and senior outside hitter Paige 
Jones, who combined for six 
kills and a service ace in the 
span of 14 points, Michigan 
nearly came back from a 21-10 
deficit 
in 
the 
second 
set, 

ultimately succumbing to a 
25-23 defeat, tying the match at 
one set apiece.

“I 
wasn’t 
swinging 

aggressively and that kind of 
got me into trouble,” Jones said. 
“(Michigan coach Mark Rosen) 
came up to us and told us that 
we need to start banging it out 
in trouble. Most of the time 
you get some good touches off 
of that ... so I just went up and 

swung away.” 

Michigan’s 
front 
row 

continued to improve in the 
later sets, building off the 
momentum 
that 
they 
had 

created on their second set run. 
Junior middle blocker May 
Pertofsky began to get more 
involved, recording eight kills 
and four blocks. 

“Late in the game May did 

a great job of coming in and 
helping block a couple times,” 
Rosen said. “Even though there 
was speed around her, she was 
able to ignore that speed and go 
get the big hit.”

The Wolverine front row 

finally brought it all together 
at the end of the fourth set. 
Tied 25-25, freshman middle 
blocker Jacque Boney showed 
her mettle. Boney got up close 
and personal with the Spartan 
attackers, earning the point 
on a powerful block. Just two 
points later, Boney did it again, 
giving Michigan a 27-26 lead. 
The Wolverines closed it out 
on the next attack, claiming 
the fourth set and the 3-1 
victory. 

“She’s a young player and 

she still has a lot of things to 
learn, but she just has an innate 
ability to block balls.” Rosen 
said. “Those were huge points 
... but she does that a lot. It’s too 
many times to be an accident.” 

Michigan’s slow start up 

front led to a dropped set and 
a heavily contested match. The 
front row’s turnaround then 
became the anchor to their 
victory. For the Wolverines 
to find success, their middle 
blockers and outside hitters 
need to begin each match at the 
level they ended it on Sunday.

After a successful road trip 

to Ithaca, N.Y, the Michigan 
field hockey team (8-0 overall, 
1-0 Big Ten) enjoyed a return to 
Ocker Field as they faced No. 
25 Michigan State (6-2, 0-2) 
and No. 23 Kent State (5-3). 
The two games played vastly 
different for the Wolverines, 
but ultimately they swept the 
weekend series, beating the 
Spartans 6-1 and the Golden 
Flash 2-1, to remain undefeated 
on the year.

Against Michigan State on 

Friday, Michigan burst out 
of the gate with a familiar 
aggressiveness, scoring twice 
within the first five minutes 
of 
the 
game. 
Sophomore 

midfielder Anouk Veen added 
the second goal via a penalty 
corner shot inserted by senior 
midfielder Kathryn Peterson.

“The past few weeks I’ve 

had some frustrating misses 
off corner shots,” Veen said. “It 
was good to finally score and 
finally convert.”

Mere seconds before the 

halftime buzzer, the Spartans 
took advantage of a blocked 
shot bouncing back to their 
forward Hannah Jarvie, who 
sent it to the back of the net 
and cut the score to 2-1. That 
score would hold until Veen 
converted 
another 
penalty 

corner shot in the 40th minute 
to make it 3-1. From there, 
the 
floodgates 
opened 
for 

Michigan’s scoring, as three 
different players added goals. 
By the end of the game, a tight 
contest became a 6-1 blowout.

“We’re a very deep and 

versatile 
team,” 
Michigan 

coach Marcia Pankratz said. 
“We ask the girls to give it their 
all as long as they can because 
we have the depth to relieve 
them when they get tired.”

In contrast to the offensive 

performance that won out 
against Michigan State, the 
Wolverines 
seemed 
unable 

to find a consistent posture 
against the Golden Flashes. 
Michigan was held out of 
the goal column the entire 
first half, a first in the young 
season.

“They played tough, and we 

knew they would,” Pankratz 
said. “We had to stay patient 
when we weren’t getting the 
opportunities we wanted.”

Kent State dominated the 

second quarter’s possessions, 
holding 
Michigan 
to 
zero 

shots 
while 
adding 
four 

unsuccessful shots of their 
own. Ultimately though, it was 
the third quarter that provided 
the majority of the game’s 
scoring, 
with 
a 
Michigan 

penalty corner from senior 
midfielder 
Sofia 
Southam 

being quickly answered by 
a Kent State equalizer. The 
game was finally put away on 
a 52nd minute penalty corner, 
converted again off the stick of 
Southam.

Southam 
finished 
the 

weekend at 13 total season 
goals, tied with North Carolina 
forward Erin Matson for the 
most in Division I.

“Most of my goals have 

come off great team work and 
team passing,” Southam said. 
“Having that team dynamic is 
huge for us.”

Michigan Anouk Veen scored two goals in Michigan’s two weekend wins.

The Michigan hockey team 

has learned to take nothing for 
granted. 

Six months ago, on the eve 

of the beginning of NCAA 
tournament play in Fargo, N.D., 
its season abruptly ended due 
to COVID-19 concerns within 
the program. The cancelation 
was a devastating blow for 
the Wolverines, who had a 
promising season and overcame 
multiple 
pandemic-related 

pauses to make it to that point. 

Eyeing the start to what is 

expected to be its first full 
season in over two years, 
Michigan isn’t looking back. 
The team is controlling what 
it can control, starting with 
practice. 

“The practices that we’ve had 

have been very competitive,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “Very high paced, very 
high spirited, right off the get 
go. This (is my) 40th year now 
at the Division 1 level coaching 
… and I can say that this year, 
it’s been as competitive on the 
ice as any of them.” 

For a team loaded with 

NHL talent — including five 
2021 first round picks — but 
lacking postseason experience, 
intense practices are vital to 
preparing the team for the 
demands of the season ahead. 
Given that the previous two 

NCAA 
tournaments 
were 

canceled 
due 
to 
COVID-19 

and the Wolverines failed to 
qualify in 2019, a vast majority 
of Michigan’s roster has never 
partaken in NCAA tournament 
action. 

Moreover, the Wolverines’ 

young 
core 
— 
featuring 

sophomore defenseman Owen 
Power, 
sophomore 
forward 

Matty 
Beniers, 
freshman 

defenseman 
Luke 
Hughes 

and sophomore forward Kent 
Johnson — have yet to play a 
college game in front of fans.

To 
compensate, 
Michigan 

has relied on its leadership to 
set the tone throughout the 
preseason.

“You have so many guys who 

just want to get better every 
day,” senior defenseman and 
captain Nick Blankenburg said. 
“That’s huge just coming into 
practice because you see how 
hard guys are working and how 
hard guys are trying to earn 
spots on the roster and you love 
to see it every day.”

With such a deep roster, 

Pearson will have to make 
difficult decisions each game 
as to who to dress. Players 
further in the depth chart are 
hyperaware of that and are 
spurring improvement amongst 
the star-studded first lines in 
the process. 

“I 
think 
tensions 
might 

get a little high sometimes,” 
Blankenburg said. “Just because 
guys are so competitive, but 

that’s a good problem to have.”

Seemingly 
secure 
roster 

positions, such as the goalie 
position, 
remain 
a 
daily 

competition at practice and are 
exasperated by the heightened 
competitive nature. Although 
sophomore Erik Portillo is the 
expected starter, sophomore 
Noah West and senior Jack 
Leavy are both capable players 
vying for playing time.

Michigan will battle Bowling 

Green 
on 
Saturday 
in 
an 

exhibition, with the regular 
season beginning the following 
weekend in a series versus Lake 
Superior State. The Wolverines 
look 
to 
balance 
intense 

practice sessions with tactful 
management of their bodies as 
the first full season nears for 
many members of the roster. 

“Our biggest concern right 

now is to just make sure we stay 
focused on the task at hand, 
and control all we can control,” 
Pearson said. 

At least for the immediate 

future, the task at hand for 
Michigan 
is 
practice. 
As 

preparations wrap-up for the 
Wolverines, their added edge 
leads the way.

“I’ve seen it the last few 

weeks,” Beniers said. “We’ve 
been going hard. … We were 
going off the ice one day and 
some of the guys were like, ‘I 
think our practices are harder 
than some of the games we play,’ 
which is kind of just a testament 
to how it’s been going so far.”

Added edge at practice fuels 
Michigan as season looms
