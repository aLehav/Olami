By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
When Michigan voters cast
theirballots in2004 to institute
a state constitutional change to
ban on same-sex marriages and

,nions, University alum Gilia
Smith felt personal ramifica-
tions from the legislation.
"My partner and I were liv-
ing in Michigan when (Propos-
al) 2 was passed, and it was very
disappointing (to us) because at
the time I knew it would have
repercussions for people in
our community," Smith said in
an interview after presenting
a recent study at yesterday's
Senate Advisory Committee on

University Affairs meeting.
Smith spoke before the lead
faculty governing body about
the findings of her study on
same-sex health benefits for
faculty and staff at various uni-
versities in the state. Channel-
ing her individual experience
into a statewide study of three
universities in Michigan, Smith
interviewed faculty members
of all sexual orientations to
assess their opinions of health

henefit policies.
"I was very personally moti-'
vated on that level," she said.
In her presentation, Smith
did not mention the names of
each institution studied but
said each university - includ-
ing the University of Michigan
- has health benefit policies
with some level of discrimina-
tion against same-sex couples.
Smith said the measure that

In a brightly lit area of the

by a life-size figure of a Ses-

room full of games and toys,

28-year-old patient Lisa Snider.
But Snider is no stranger
here.
Due to a heart condition
called Tetralogy of Fallot that
Snider has had since birth,
her treatment over the years
has involved a team of pediat-

Council discusses
potential medical

By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor residents are left
with a cliffhanger once again
regarding future medical mari-

juana regulation in the city.
After a discussion lasting
more than three hours, the Ann
Arbor City Council again post-
poned the initial reading of a
proposed ordinance that would
monitor medical marijuana cul-
tivation and distribution in the
city at its meeting last night.
Instead, a series of amendments
to the proposal were discussed.
This is the fifth meeting at

which council has delayed vot-
ing on the ordinance.
In an interview before the
meeting, City Attorney Stephen
Postema said there is no legal
limit on how many times coun-
cil can postpone the first read-
ing of the ordinance. He noted
that council may be postponing

New store faces
criticism for
chain affiliation
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The 200 block of South State
Street now has a building with
a glowing red and white sign
in front of a refurbished white

fagade instead of scaffolding
and bulldozers.
After about nine months of
construction, including side-
walk and street closures, the
CVS on South State Street is
slated to open its doors on
March 20. The pharmacy has
been part of a citywide discus-
sion on the changing nature of
downtown Ann Arbor.
The upcoming CVS will join
five other CVS pharmacies in

the area, and CVS officials say
they have high hopes for the
new location.
"When we add multiple
stores in an area, it means we
want to make sure we're ade-
quately serving a community,"
Mike DeAngelis, director of
public relations at CVS, said.
DeAngelis said work will
still be done on the inside the
building before the opening.

Perserving'U' history

Many students may not
be aware of major Univer-
sity milestones like when
women were first admitted
in 1870 or the announce-
ment of Jonas Salk's polio
vaccine in 1955. But one
group aims to educate the
community about these
events through physical
memorials around campus.
The University Commit-
tee on History and Tradi-
tions maintains 26 plaques
and markers on campus
that contain information
about people, events and
structures considered sig-
nificant to Universityhisto-
ry. Through these symbols,
the committee seeks to

keep events - like John
F. Kennedy's 1960 speech
that helped launch the
Peace Corps - vibrant in
students' minds long after
they take campus tours.
Former University Presi-
dent James Duderstadt
formed the committee in
1991 to lead the preserva-
tion of University history,
according to the commit-
tee's website.
The director of the
Bentley Historical Library
- which keeps all the Uni-
versity's archives and his-
torical documents as well
as information about the
state - is required to serve
on the committee, as dic-

tated by the committee's
rules on membership.
The committee answers
directly to University
Mary Sue Coleman and is
responsible for advising
the president on questions
concerning University tra-
ditions and historical con-
text.
According to the com-
mittee's website, the last
plaque was installed in
2006, when seven mark-
ers were placed in various
places on campus, includ-
ing in Hill Auditorium,
the Law Quadrangle and
the William L. Clements
Library.

Britain, France
drafting no-fly zone
U.N. resolution
RAS LANOUF, Libya (AP) -
Repeated airstrikes by Libyan
warplanes yesterday illustrated
theedgeMoammarGadhafiholds
in his fight against rebel forces
marching toward the capital: He
controls the air. After pleading
from the uprising's leaders, Brit-
ain and France began drafting a
U.N. resolution for a no-fly zone
in Libya that could balance the
scales.
President Barack Obama
warned that the U.S. and its
NATO allies are still considering
military options to stop what he
called "unacceptable" violence by
Gadhafi's regime. NATO decided
to boost flights of AWACs surveil-
lance planes over Libya from 10 to
24 hours a day, the U.S. Ambas-
sador to NATO Ivo Daalder said.
"I want to send a very clear
message to those who are around

Colonel Gadhafi. It is their choice
to make how they operate mov-
ing forward. And they will be
held accountable for whatever
violence continues to take place,"
Obama said during remarks in
the Oval Office yesterday.
Libyan warplanes launched
multiple airstrikes yesterday on
opposition fighters regrouping at
the oil port of Ras Lanouf on the
Mediterranean coast a day after
they were driven back by a heavy
government counteroffensive
aimed at stopping the rebel drive
toward Tripoli, Gadhafi's strong-
hold.
One strike hit near a gas station
in Ras Lanouf, blasting two large
craters in the road and wounding
at least two people in a pick up
truck.
The rebels oppose any West-
ern ground troops deploying in
Libya, but they're pressing for
a no-fly zone to relieve them of
the threat from the air. The reb-
els can take on "the rockets and
the tanks, but not Gadhafi's air
force," said Ali Suleiman, a rebel

fighter at Ras Lanouf. "We don't
want a foreign military interven-
tion (on the ground), but we do
want a no-fly zone. We are all
waiting for one."
Arab Gulf countries joined the
calls for a no-fly zone, with the
foreign minister of the United
Arab Emirates saying a confer-
ence of his country's neighbors
that the U.N. Security Council
should "shoulder its historical
responsibility for protecting the
Libyan people."
Still, Western military inter-
vention does not seem imminent
- and the warnings may be an
attempt to intimidate Gadhafi
with words before deeds. British
and French officials said the no-
fly resolution was being drawn
up as a contingency and it has not
been decided whether to put it
before the U.N. Security Council,
where Russia holds veto power
and has rejected such a move.
Western officials have said a no-
fly zone does not require a U.N.
mandate, but they would prefer to
have one.

Former Detroit Mayor Kwame

his administration.
Kilpatrick was in court to

Killer on death row
named suspect in
unsolved murder
Authorities say a convicted
serial killer on death row is sus-
pected in the long-unsolved
murder of a 19-year-old aspiring
actress in the San Francisco Bay
area.
The Orange County Register
reported yesterday that Marin
County investigators believe
Rodney Alcala was responsible
for the death of Pamela Lambson
in 1977. However, detectives say
Alcala won't be charged because
of insufficient genetic material.
Alcala was convicted last year
of murdering a 12-year-old girl
and four womenin Southern Cal-
ifornia in the late 1970s. He was
recently indicted in the deaths of
two women in New York.
Lambson disappeared after she
went to pose for a freelance pho-
tographer in San Francisco. Her
battered body was found the next
day.

Van der Sloot to

Joran van der Sloot plans to

insanity in a bid to significantly
shorten his sentence, his defense
lawyer said yesterday.
Van der Sloot, the key suspect
in the 2005 disappearance of U.S.
teenager Natalee Holloway on
the Caribbean island of Aruba,
will use a "violent emotion"
defense in the slaying of Steph-
any Flores, attorney Maximo
Altez told The Associated Press.
Altez said he filed papers three
weeks ago informing prosecutors
of his intent to argue that Van der

Sloot became enraged and killed
the 21-year-old Peruvian busi-
ness student last May 30 because
she had learned of his relation to
Holloway by looking in his lap-
top.

1,000 immigrants
arrive in Italy
from North Africa
More than 1,000 migrants
from North Africa have arrived
in Italy-overnight, some in rick-
ety boats that had to be escorted
ashore by the Italian coast guard.
It was one of the biggest arriv-
als since a steady influx of Tuni-
sians started in mid-January,
when an uprising ousted the
country's longtime president
and caused a breakdown in
coastal patrols. The uprising in
Libya also has caused concern
here that tens of thousands of
migrants might be on their way.
News, reports said yesterday
that a dozen boats had landed in
the tiny Sicilian island of Lampe-
dusa since shortly before mid-
night. The migrants are mostly
Tunisians.
Italy has sought the help of
Europe .as it copes with the
migrant influx.

French court puts
corruption trial
of Chirac on hold

Charges against
former French
president allege
misuse of funds
PARIS (AP) - Time may again
be on Jacques Chirac's side.
The French former president
gained a one-day reprieve - and
possibly much more - after a
Paris court said it needs time to
rule whether a historic corruption
trial that started yesterday with
him as the star defendant adheres
to France's constitution and can
go forward.
The trial of Chirac is the first of
aformerFrenchheadofstatesince
the World War II era, when Mar-
shal Philippe Petain, the leader
of France's Nazi collaborationist
regime, was convicted of treason
and shipped into exile.
And with France's presidential
election on the way next year, the
trial is shaping up as a glimpse of
the unseemly underworld of kick-
backs, corruption and embezzle-
ment that has long roiled the
French politicalsystem.
The trial centers on Chirac's
time as Paris mayor between 1977
and 1995 - before he was elected
president - and claims that he
and his allies misused city funds.
He hasrepeatedlydenied the alle-
gations.
Chirac was not on hand for the
trial start yesterday, which was
largely procedural. But a lawyer
for one of his nine co-defendants
argued that a key complaint in
the case was made too long ago to
merit a trial today.
Presiding Judge Dominique
Pauthe heard arguments by the
defense attorneys - backedby the
Paris prosecutor - about whether
combining two cases at the root of

the case meets a crucial constitu-
tionaltest.
The trial centers on an alleged
28 jobs paid for by Chirac's City
Hall from 1992 to 1995, but for
work that instead benefited his
RPR political party and its allies.
It has been brought by two inves-
tigating magistrates in Paris and
suburban Nanterre, whose two
cases have been fused into one.
Jean-Yves Le Borgne, lawyer
for former Chirac chief-of-staff
Remy Chardon, argued that the
statute of limitations had run out
on the Paris case - and that the
one in Nanterre was joined to it
just to get around that fact.
After a 2-1/2-hour hearing,
Pauthe said his panel will rule
by Tuesday whether Le Bor-
gne's call for the Court of Cassa-
tion, France's highest court, to
get involved was warranted - a
move that could delay the trial for
weeks.
The Court of Cassation, if
summoned, would have the
option of sending the motion
to the Constitutional Council,
which judges the constitution-
ality of French laws.
Interestingly, Chirac,
because he is a former presi-
dent, is a member of that
council, and former National
Assembly president Jean-Lou-
is Debre, the brother of one
of the other trial defendants,
Francois Debre, heads it.
A referral to the Court of
Cassation would mean a tem-
porary reprieve for Chirac that
could last for days, weeks or
even a year.
Chirac, who had been plan-
ning on coming to court for
Tuesday's proceedings, has
now put off his appearance for
at least one day, according to
his spokeswoman, Benedicte

Prime minister
names new leaders
after revolt
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -
Tunisia's prime minister named
a new interim government yes-
terday and a much-hated police
unit was disbanded as the
interim leadership of this North
African nation seeks to stabilize
a country still finding its way
after a popular revolt.
Prime Minister Beji Caid
Essebsi kept the heads of the
key defense, interior, justice
and foreign affairs ministries,
but named new figures to six
posts vacated last week. Some
ministers who left were seen as
too close to the regime of oust-
ed President Zine El Abidine
Ben Ali. Others who resigned
hope to run for office and were
forced out.
Caid Essebsi reiterated that
his priorities are re-establish-
ing security, rebuilding Tuni-
sia's troubled economy, and
bringing life back to normal in
the country that has long been
a tourist draw for sun-minded
Europeans.
"Without security, there is
no development and investors
won't come back," he told a
news conference.
Meanwhile, the Interior
Ministry announced it has
abolished the dreaded State
Security Department, whose
so-called political police spied
on and harassed citizens under
Ben Ali.
The ministry said on its Face-
book page that it is dismantling
the force "in accordance with
the values and the principles of
the revolution."
Its disbanding has been one
of the demands of the pro-
democracy activists who have
kept up the pressure on the
interim leadership as it seeks to
navigate the country into a new
era, following an uprising that
ousted Ben Ali on Jan.14, which
in turn sparked revolts around

the Arab world.
It also comes as Tunisia
struggles to cope with tens of
thousands of refugees stream-
ing across its border from Libya.
By making the announce-
ment on Facebook, the ministry
was also sending a statement
to the protesters. Under Ben
Ali, Tunisian authorities sup-
pressed independent media
and political dissent, but anti-
government movements mobi-
lized on social networking
sites to stage demonstrations
in December and January.
Many protests turned deadly, as
police fired on crowds.
The 84-year-old Caid Esseb-
si, himself named just a week
ago after his predecessor quit
amid renewed protests, said the
new appointments have been
approved by the interim presi-
dent. He had said on Friday that
he would present a new Cabinet
to help pull his country back
from the "abyss."
Last week, interim president
Fouad Mebazaa announced an
election on July 24 for a body
that will draw up a new consti-
tution.
"We must ensure that these
elections are a success and that
they are honest and transpar-
ent," Caid Essebsi said.
Electing a constituent assem-
bly is seen as a step toward
eventual presidential elections.
The prime minister said he
was open to all political ten-
dencies in a country that had
known only one-party rule.
Two opposition leaders were
among those who left the gov-
ernment last week, citing an
order that ministers not run for
president.
Sorbonne-educated Abder-
razak Zouari was named to
replace Nejib Chebbi, head
of the PDP party, as regional
development minister.
And U.S.- and French-trained
professor Rifaat Chaabouni
was promoted to minister for
higher education and research,
replacing Ettajdid party chief
Ahmed Brahim.

Walker calls
request to alter bill
ridiculous'
MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Wis-
consin Democrats who fled the
state nearly three weeks ago
asked yesterday for a meeting
with Gov. Scott Walker to talk
about changes to his plan to
eliminate most public workers'
union rights, a request the gov-
ernor dismissed as "ridiculous."
Walker said he and his
administration have 'been in
communication with at least
a couple of the AWOL Senate
Democrats about a deal that
could bring them back, but the
lawmaker who asked for the
meeting, Senate Minority Lead-
er Mark Miller, "is firmly stand-
ing in the way."
That accusation led to a
flurry of angry responses from
Democrats who said Walker
was misrepresenting the talks.
The sometimes-angry exchange
suggested that any resolution to
the stalemate was farther away
than ever -
"Right now,;I'm so damn mad
at his misrepresentation of the
truth and the public should be
as well," said Sen. Bob Jauch,
one of two Democrats who had
talked last week with the Sen-
ate Republican leader about
possible compromises. "Trust is
completely broken down now. I
don't believe anything he says."
The standoff has drawn
national attention and placed
Wisconsin at the center a vig-
orous debate over the future of
union rights. Walker's propos-
al to balance the state budget
remains in limbo because, with-
out the 14 Democrats, the state
Senate does not have enough
members present for a quo-
rum.
The senators said pressure
is mounting on Walker and
the GOP to compromise after
weeks of protests that have
drawn tens of thousands of
people to the Capitol.
In addition, polls show sub-
stantial opposition to the gov-
ernor and his plan, and recall
efforts have been launched
against Republican senators.
Recall efforts have also begun
against the Democrats.
"The problem for the Dem-
ocrats is to figure out how to
come back and not be seen
as conceding," said Charles
Franklin, a University of Wis-
consin-Madison political sci-
ence professor and founder of
pollster.com.
"Both sides have been so
strongly supported by their
constituencies that it makes it
awfully hard to compromise
unless they can find a way to
both claim victory," Franklin
said. "And that's certainly dif-
ficult."
Walker tried to place blame
for the stalemate on Miller,
the Democratic leader in the
Senate, saying he blocked
progress on talks with Jauch
and Sen. Tim Cullen.

"It leads you to question
who's in charge," Walker
said at a news conference
also attended by the Republi-
can leaders of the Senate and
Assembly.

Don't share the sacrifice
Snyder shouldn't make drastic cuts to education
There are few things college students hate more than
tuition increases. But as the University tries to cope
with Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's proposed cuts to
higher education funding, students may be in store for disap-
pointment.

The premise behind Snyder's budget pro-,
posal was all about "shared sacrifice." The
state is facing major budget shortfalls, and
changes need to be made to ensure that Michi-
gan has a healthy economic future. This is a
pointthatmoststateleaders agree on.Another
point of agreement is the importance of help-
ing Michigan businesses succeed in order to
foster job production and bring innovative
minds to the state. State leaders, including
University President Mary Sue Coleman, also
believe strong education systems are impor-
tant for the future of the state.
When it comes to budget cuts, there are
clear financial priorities and places that need
to be "sacrificed," but universities should not
be one of them.
Whereas Snyder cut taxes for businesses by
more than $1 billion, he also cut funding for
Universities by 15 percent - with the poten-
tial for more cuts if schools don't keep tuition
increases under 7.1 percent. Businesses see
huge financial relief, and schools see major
financial setbacks - not quite the attitude of
"shared sacrifice" that Snyder likes to discuss.
Cuts need to be made and spending needs
to be controlled, but it's difficult to listen to
speeches about the importance of education
when the state's true attitude about what's

will be below the 7.1percent mark when tuition
is decided this summer. An increase of that
magnitude would translate to a tuition hike
of $827 for in-state students and $2,542.66 for
out-of-state students paying lower division
LSA tuition, according to a March 7 Michi-
gan Daily article. While testifying before the
state Senate and House Appropriations Sub-
committees on Higher Education last week,
Coleman discussed the University's value to
the state and the importance of education. But
for students and parents facingthe potentially
staggering tuition increases, her words are
takenwith a grain of salt.
When 2011-2012 tuition rates become avail-
able for public universities throughout the
state, some students will be forced to take out
additional loans, place an even heavier finan-
cial burden on their parents or decide that
higher education is simply not a viable option.
Either way, students will certainly feel their
share of the sacrifice.
The University - and all 15 public univer-
sities in Michigan - need to be recognized as
an asset to the state, not an undue expense.
For businesses to fill the new jobs that their
tax breaks will hopefully allow them to cre-
ate, they will need a well-educated Michigan
work force, and those people should come
n rsssn~ras xiroveita ihie~rnt

During the November 2010
midterm election cycle, we
Americans found out that
Republicans are
serious about
reducing the def-
icit. Of course,
the GOP must
have decided
on this position
only after former
president George DAR-WEI
W. Bush left CHEN
office because
he ran up record
deficits by engaging in two wars and
not raising taxes - but that's a story
for another time. This new com-
mitment to fiscal responsibility has
materialized in Wisconsin where
Republican Gov. Scott Walker wants
to force public sector unions to pay
more for their benefits and to receive
pay cuts. Sounds good, right? Unions
should have to pitch in like everyone
else to help the state and the country
weather this recession.
As it turns out, the unions agree.
In fact, they have made all the
financial concessions that Walker
has asked for in his new bill. So,
what is the ruckus about? Appar-
ently, Walker also wants to strip
unions of collective bargaining
rights. Financial benefits for the
state from doing this would be...
almost nothing. So, why does Walk-
er want to do this to unions that are
important to average working-class
Americans? Wasn't this bill sup-
posed to be concerned only with
fiscal issues? Good question.
The fact, thatWalkr insists on
stripping --tnion-of collective-bar-
gaining rights even when his
financial derhands are met - shows
that he isn't actually concerned
about deficit reduction. His goal,
deep inside, is to bust the unions.
He might say this bill isn't about

our cherished unions and that it's
all about budget, but that mantra is
a facade. Busting the Democratic-
leaning public sector unions would
be a huge political boon for the GOP
because unions are the last reli-
ably liberal group that can compete
with typically conservative bigbusi-
nesses interms of political influence.
For Walker, this move is a political
"power grab" that has'nothing to do
with the deficit.
Even if you believe Walker is
really only concerned about the
deficit and that he sees breaking
up unions as a necessary evil, this
move seems to be antithetical to
GOP "principles." When President
Barack Obama was trying to pass
his health care reform law, Repub-
licans complained loudly about how
the bill was being "jammed down
our throats" against the will of the
people. Their point was that Wash-
ington shouldn't legislate without
consent of the governed, and aver-
age Americans should have a say
- a very American idea indeed.
But when it comes to those same
average Americans union work-
ers, the GOP suddenly doesn't want
the voices of those workers to be
heard anymore. Instead, Republi-
cans would prefer that they be run
over roughshod without the right to
collectively bargain. By the way, if
you still believe Walker is a deficit
hawk, please know that he recently
passed tax cuts that would add $100
million to Wisconsin's projected
budget deficit.
Perhaps one of the worst things
t, pome, Put,.f,,theWisconsin
union battle is th desonization
of teachers as people who live off
the proverbial "gravy train." When
did America get the reputation of
treating its public school teachers
extremely well? One of the reasons
that American students are lagging

behind their counterparts in other
countries is that teaching isn't avery
appealingjob, leadingtotoptalentin
America often looking elsewhere for
work. That's not to say we don't have
great teachers - the point is that
their lifestyles are nowhere close
to lavish. But for the sake of debate,
let's say that teachers have extrava-
gant livelihoods that the GOP feels
should be limited. Then why do
they say in the next breath that we
need to protect the people making
more than $250,000 per year and
that they should receive bigger tax
breaks than everyone else in this
economic climate? According to Fox
News, those top 2 percent of house-
holds aren't as well to do as many
think and need help. But teachers?
Let's take down those fat cats.
Walker isn't
concerned about
deficit reductions.

Republicans dream of cycles
like these: lowering taxes for the
wealthy, running up deficits and
then cutting benefits for the mid-
dle and lower class in the name of
deficit reduction. It's unpatriotic,
and now the GOP isn't even being
honest about it. Using deficit reduc-
tion to disguise their union-crush-
ing power grabs is clever, but that
doesn'tjake it right The American
pedplesee that it's dt the ecnomy,

And unions are as American as

Import to Detroit

It's midterm season, and every student's life
has been a little hectic lately. When it comes
time for finals, we don't have class during
the week, allowing more time for students to
study. During midterms, however, students
still have to attend regularly scheduled class-
es, on top of participating in extracurriculars
and other activities. I can understand it's very
difficult and stressful to squeeze in study time
during all these things. But many students still
manage to do so successfully and pass their
exams with flying colors.
So how do they do it? They know that school
is a priority and sometimes that means making
sacrifices like staying in on a Friday night or
skipping this week's episode of "Jersey Shore."
But some students still can't seem to find time
to adequately prepare for their tests, so they
end up cramming the night before - or even
the day of - their exam. Thankfully, I've never
had to do this. I've been able to find additional
time to study well in advance for my tests so
I'm not stressing right before. But students
who do end up cramming obviously need some
sort of artificial help to stay focused and stay
awake. For many, the solution to this problem
is caffeine, whether it be in the form of coffee
or Pepsi Max. Some will take small breaks, lis-
tening to music to refocus, or watch a funny
You-tube video before they go back to study-
ing. But what if you wait so long to study for an
exam that you don't even have time for that?
Well, there is one other solution that is becom-
ing increasingly popular - Adderall.
Adderall - originally a drug prescribed to
patients with attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder (ADHD) - is now being used by
college students who need to sit down for six
hours or more and cram for an exam. Accord-
ing to a 2006-2007 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health, 7 percent of full-time college
students are using Adderall illegally. This
number may not seem like a lot, but in my

freshman class of about 6,000, that means 420
students are abusing Adderall. And college
students ages 18 to 22 are twice as likelyto use
the drug illegally than those not enrolled in
college. Though not expensive - pills sold at
the University of Oregon have been reported
to go for $5 to $15 per pill - this drugcan lead
down a dangerous path.
Adderall is perceived as a quick fix to stay
awake and get some work done. And it seems
harmless - after all, it's legally prescribed
to many people - but it has the potential to
further an individual's drug use. There have
been multiple depictions in the media of a
Wall Street banker snorting a line of cocaine
in the bathroom to stay up all night and party
after working an 18-hour day. That person
didn't walk into his job thinking, "I'm going
to need to become a coke user to get through
these next few years." He started out think-
ing he would be able to handle it, and when
he became overworked and was left with no
other option, he turned to drug use. Cocaine
might be a bit of an extreme example, but it
has the same basis as using Adderall. Stu-
dents who feel like they have no other option
will turn to this drug to get them through
midterms and finals. It may prove to be a
good idea in the short-run, but drugs are
never a good idea in the long-run.
If students can't be successful at the Uni-
versity without using artificial means, will
they be able to be successful in life? It's
unrealistic to think that you can depend on
Adderall to get you through a particularly
busy week of work or a long meeting you need
to focus on. Students shouldn't use this drug
as a quick-fix. In the real world, drugs can't
solve your problems - they will only make
them worse.

It might be a little too early to call, but I'm saying it
anyway: Detroit has officially become cool. It must have
happened somewhere in between Eminem driving with
the guitar track to "8 Mile" playing, a gospel choir sign-
ing powerful chords in the background and the news
that a Robocop statue would indeedbe coming to Detroit
(If you think I'm kidding, look it up. It's happening, get
excited). But despite the new post-industrial, resilient
and rugged makeover the city received from Chrysler's
Super Bowl commercial, Detroit still faces major struc-
tural and planning problems. And while the stylistic
remake is nice, and certainly is a necessity to the overall
reinvention of Detroit, it doesn't solve the material prob-
lems that Detroit faces - specifically population decline
and abandoned neighborhoods.
The Chrysler commercial ends with what should
become an iconic phrase: imported from Detroit. But
what Detroit needs to concern itself with is how to also
import people into Detroit. That is, how to make equi-
librium in a region that essentially is a donut - a met-
ropolitan area without a hub city. Michigan residents
overwhelmingly choose to live in the suburbs, and those
who do reside in Detroit only find work outside its city
limits. But Detroit Mayor Dave Bing and Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder have introduced new programs to help
solve that problem and entice more residents to live in
the city.
If you have ever played Sim City, you'll recognize that
municipal and citywide issues usually have a cyclical
effect, and just like your virtual city, the same is true
for Detroit. Population decline causes the loss of the
tax base and tax revenue. This in turn causes a dip in
city services, which causes more population decline.
When population declines, businesses leave. When busi-
nesses leave, jobs leave. With no employment in the city,
residents default on their homes, and neighborhoods
become abandoned. Abandoned neighborhoods cause
a decrease in property value, leaving no incentive for
people to return to the city. It's a complex succession
of events that would probably better be described in an
ever useful flowchart. What Bing and Snyder's plans
attempt to do is to break the cycle by providing financial
incentives for buying homes in specific neighborhoods
that have the greatest chance of development.

Bing's plan, entitled Project 14, has received a lot of
criticism from Detroit's City Council, but is actually a
valid and beneficial program. Project 14, using funds
from the Federal Neighborhood Revitalization Initia-
tive given to Detroit, plans to renovate 200 homes in the
Boston-Edison and East English Village and then offer
them to the 53 percent of Detroit police officers who
don't live in the city at reduced costs. The genius of the
plan comes in its ability to address two problems atonce.
Not only does Project 14 work to bring in more residents
to Detroit - specifically financially stable and middle
class residents - but since the incentive is for police
officers, Bing is also addressing the problem of crime.
Having police officers live and work in those neighbor-
hoods fosters community and an environment of safety
- something that would certainly incentivize others to
move as well.
Snyder also mentioned in his State of the State
address a new initiative called "Live Midtown." The
project is part of a greater program called 15x15, which
is designed to get 15,000 young people to move to Detroit
by 2015. "Live Midtown" offers incentives to employees
of the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit Medical Cen-
ter and Wayne State University to buy apartments or
homes in the Midtown Detroit area, another burgeoning
neighborhood in the city. The hope is that these financial
incentives will encourage young professionals who work
for those employers to move to Midtown. The program
has been highly touted and has high expectations for
being successful.
Detroit had previously tried a residency requirement
for public employees that ended up causing strife, anger
and tension between the suburbs and Detroit until its
repeal in1999. So, it'sgood to see the leaders of this state,
Bing and Snyder, recognize bad policy and take a differ-
ent approach to entice people to live in Detroit. If the
Robocop statue or Eminem's sleek driving skills weren't
enough, programs like Project 14 and "Live Midtown"
will work to incentivize moving to Detroit and further
a professional youth movement to move back to the
city and help with its revitalization. For me personally,
though, they had me at Robocop.

BENEFITS
From Page 1
amended Michigan's constitu-
tion in 2004 drastically changed
health care benefits for same-sex
couples across the state. Before
the change, same-sex couples
were recognized as domestic
partners in benefit programs.
However, this was ruled uncon-
stitutional following the 2004
vote.
Smith explained that after the
ruling, higher education insti-
tutions struggled to draw and
retain LGBTQ employees in the
new, unwelcoming climate.
Smith said this resulted in
the establishment of a loophole
that allowed faculty members to
designate one other beneficiary
on their health plan. This option
is currently open to both same-
sex and heterosexual unmarried
couples.
During her presentation,
Smith said the new beneficiary
program that universities set up
had unintended side effects. The
new policy, she said, dismantled
rights and privileges tradition-
ally associated with marriage
because of the high number of
unmarried heterosexual couples
receiving benefits.
Many taxpayers voted for
the 2004 ballot initiative, Smith
said, because they believed they
shouldn't have to financially sup-
port same-sex couples. However,
she explained that the benefi-
ciary program designed to attract
LGBTQ faculty actually increas-
es the cost of health programs.
Additionally, Smith said the
fairness of the policies varies
based on the institution.
"It is easy to manipulate (the
policies) and create restricted
universe of eligibility," she said.
Smith pointed to institutions
that use age caps to restrict
graduate students or eligibility
restrictions to limit the number

of participants in the program.
She also said same-sex couples
have to wait longer than hetero-
sexual couples for their benefits.
Smith said though the Univer-
sity doesn't have an age cap, it
still restricts eligibilityby enforc-
ing a rule that requires partners
to live together for six-months.
She added that these regula-
tions wouldn't be tolerated if they
were based on another demo-
graphic like race.
"Would it be admissible to cap
the number of benefits for other
minority groups?" she asked.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman,
a professor of statistics, agreed
with Smith at the meeting that
these restrictions are "not fair."
At the end of the presenta-
tion, Smith suggested University
administrators consider moving
LGBTQ issues to the forefront of
discussions on faculty diversity.
She said school officials often
don't realize how faculty mem-
bers are discriminated against as
a result of institutional policy.
"My aim in coming to talk to
you today was emphasizing that
this is an issue of fairness and
equality," she said.
Because there wasn't a broad
understanding of the impact
this constitutional amendment
would have, Smith said, she felt
compelled to promote awareness
through her study. She said she
plans to continue to make pre-
sentations and publish her find-
ings within the next few years to
make the information more read-
ily available.
Smith said though the long-
termgoal of the University should
be to create an atmosphere where
LGBTQ individuals feel com-
fortable, short-term changes can
have a major influence.
"It wouldn't cost very much
for the institutions to do the right
thing, the fair thing," she said.
"And that is to make same-sex
heath benefits as accessible as
they are for married folks."

year and assists 2,000 research-
ers on campus, according to the
press release. The extra space
at the NCRC will allow 10 more
staff members to join the DNA
analysis team.
University of Michigan Health
System spokeswoman Mary Mas-
son said in an interview lastnight
that the NCRC has the potential
to have a vast economic impact
on surroundingbusinesses.
CVS
From Page 1
During the building's con-
struction some debate has cen-
tered on whether a chain store
would mesh with the historic
buildings that comprise down-
town Ann Arbor.
The State Street location that
CVS now occupies has a historic
background. The faeade of the
building was built in the 1930s,
and the original structure -
demolished in the store's con-
struction - was erected in 1899.
Ann Arbor's Historic District
Commission allowed CVS to tear
down the old building except for
the fagade in May 2009.
The chain convenience store
7-Eleven opened in January,
several blocks down on South
State Street from the forthcom-
ing CVS. The store's owner Linda
Russ said at the time that she
hoped to have the store join the
Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Regional
Chamber of Commerce, as well
as the State Street Association,
and integrate into the commu-

"Because the funding comes to
these researchers, they often use
it to either hire lab assistants or
use services within the commu-
nity that result in an economic
ripple effect," Masson said.
The press release cites an anal-
ysis by the Association of Ameri-
can Medical Colleges, which
determined that for each dollar
spent at a university hospital, an
extra $1.30 is "re-spent" on other
ventures.
NCRC Managing Director
Joan Keiser, also an adjunct pro-
fessor of physiology at the Uni-
versity's Medical School, wrote
nity.
Diane Keller, president and
CEO of the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti
Regional Chamber of Commerce,
said in an interview in January
that the group has various busi-
nesses and organizations that are
chains and members.
However, some community
members don't want chain sto-
ries moving in, DeAngelis said.
Despite the opposition, he said
he isn't concerned about this
affecting the new CVS.
"What generally happens is
that we're welcomed in once
(residents) come in (to CVS) and
have been there," DeAngelis said.
The company originally
bought the property on State
Street because of its convenient
location, DeAngelis said.
"It's a great site with lots of
foot traffic," he said.
DeAngelis said he doesn't
think other pharmacies in the
area will pose a problem for CVS,
addingthat the franchise offers a
more convenient shopping expe-
rience.
However, Debra Cook, man-
ager of The Village Apothecary

in the release that such a large
move of researchers into the
NCRC required substantial prep-
aration.
"Each of these researchers
operates their own little busi-
ness and are passionate about
their productivity ... so we really
had to make an effort to bring up
the core services to support them
in parallel with their moves,"
Keiser wrote.
The NCRC was established
shortly after the University pur-
chased the site of the former
Pfizer facility for $108 million
dollars in June 2010. The 173.5-
- a locally owned pharmacy on
South University Avenue affili-
ated with Sav-Mor Drug Stores -
said she doesn't think people will
seek out the South Street CVS if
they aren't nearby.
"I think in the wintertime if
(customers) need something, and
they're in the area (of South Uni-
versity), they're notgoing to walk
all the way over there," she said.
Cook added that despite CVS
being a chain pharmacy with
a large national presence, it
can't compete with The Village
Apothecary which is more than
50 years old and has loyal cus-
tomers from the community.
"We're more like a home-type
family business, compared to a
chain where no one knows your
name," Cook said. "I've had cus-
tomers come in and say I'm here
because I was at CVS, didn't like
the way I was treated and I don't
want to be a number."
But some students said
despite CVS being a chain store,
they favor the pharmacy's lower
costs.
Business sophomore Jordan
Kaye said he thinks CVS will

acre complex houses 28 buildings
that contain various laboratories
and offices.
Ora Pescovitz, the Universi-
ty's executive vice president for
medical affairs, said in an inter-
view last summer that the NCRC
would become a resource for sci-
entists in multiple areas to work
with each other in their research
pursuits.
"We're really excited about the
types of research programs that
will be brought in here," Pesco-
vitz said. "We're going to take
advantage of the fact that the
space is wide-open."
provide a source for students to
purchase less expensive essen-
tials and toiletries, which is a
major priority for students on a
tight budget.
LSA senior Kaili McKnight
said the new CVS will provide
an accessible option for students
without personal transportation
to travel to drugstores farther
from campus.
"I think it'll be more conve-
nientfor all the students because
some students don't have access
because they don't have cars,
so it'll just be easier for them,"
McKnight said.
Kaye said despite CVS being
a chain, he doesn't think it
will have a big impact on State
Street's image.
"I think people like CVS,"
Kaye said. "CVS is a big name,
so I guess that may hurt (State
Street), but I still don't think so."
But McKnight said it is "dis-
heartening" that CVS may take
away from locally owned busi-
nesses like The Village Apoth-
ecary.
"I do think it's a big deal," she
said.

CITY COUNCIL
From Page 1
ond reading.
Proposed by City Council
member Sabra Briere (D-Ward
1), one.,namendment discussed._
last night wold allow A medical
marijuani- patient and ai' Ainn
Arbor resident who isn't a City
Council member, physician or
medical marijuana caregiver to
become a member on a proposed
board that would approve medi-
cal marijuana dispensary and
cultivation facility licenses.
In response to Briere's pro-
posal, City Council member
Tony Derezinski (D-Ward 2)
pointed out that by labeling the
newly added board member as
an "Ann Arbor resident," one
could infer that the other four
board members would not need
to be residents of Ann Arbor.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje responded by saying that
non-residents are only allowed
to hold a position on a city board
if they possess expert skills
that would benefit that particu-
lar group. He added that such
a board member also must be
approved by a supermajority
of the City Council members.
However, Hieftje said he would
prefer all board members be
Ann Arbor residents.
Offering a solution, Postema
said the amendment could
denote the board member as
"one other Ann Arbor resi-
dent." Briere acknowledged her
support of this change to her
amendment.

Later in the discussion of
the amendment, Marcia Hig-
gins (D-Ward 4) noted that
city board commissioners are
required to identify themselves
by their addresses, which may
be available in public records.
She pointed=out,thatAhiscould,
cause a problein bdeause ifany
caregivers andpaHencs are cob'
cerned with keeping their per-
sonal information from the eyes
of federal officials.
Hieftje said requiring these
particular board members to
provide their personal informa-
tion could constrain the variety
of candidates available for coun-
cil to choose from.
"It could create a situation
where there's an extremely nar-
row field of applicants," he said.
City Council member Sandi
Smith (D-Ward 1) noted that
this change could be made in the
second reading of the ordinance.
In an interview after he spoke
in front of council, Matthew
Abel, senior partner at Canna-
bis Counsel P.L.C. - a Detroit-
based law firm that specializes
in cases related to marijuana -
said council should consider the
importance of privacy when
deliberating on the ordinance.
"We are concerned that the
federal government does influ-
ence our records and we're con-
cerned that that may continue,"
Abel said. "I recommend to
my clients to keep a minimum
amount of records. Unfortu-
nately it has to be that way."

MOTT
From Page 1
To improve her condition -
which consists of four congenital
heart defects - Snider under-
went two open-heart surgeries,
one during infancy and the other
at age four. Snider expected to
need an additional surgery at age
12, but her heart managed to con-
tinue functioning without seri-
ous medical intervention from
her adolescence into her late 20s.
"It was a miracle that I didn't
die in the last 15 years," she said
in a phone interview.
But as Snider and her husband
began plans to conceive their
first child last year, her doctors
advised her to have another sur-
gery to provide additional sup-
port for her heart before it would
undergo strain from pregnancy.
Snider's procedure - cur-
rently available at a limited
number of hospitals throughout
the country - uses the Melody
Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve,
which was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
in January 2010. The valve is
inserted via a catheter into the
leg, maneuvered through the
torso and placed between the
right ventricle of the heart and

pulmonary artery.
Though the procedure is still
in its pilot stages, it has already
exhibited high success rates in
Europe.
Since a catheter is used to
guide the valve into the heart,
the procedure is considered less
invasive than open-heart sur-
gery. This knowledge, in addi-
tion to support from her family
and friends, allowed Snider to
put her full faith in the new pro-
cedure, which she had last April.
"We just prayed and knew it
was going to be good," Snider
said. "We weren't really worried."
Before the introduction of
the Melody Valve, patients often
underwent high-risk open-heart
surgeries to replace faulty valves
that had grown weak over time,
according to Aimee Armstrong,
a pediatric interventional cardi-
ologist at Mott and Snider's pri-
mary surgeon.
Open-heart surgeries often
cause scar tissue to form over the
heart, said Armstrong, who is
also an assistant professor in the
Department of Pediatrics and
Communicable Diseases at the
University's Medical School.
"This complicates future sur-
geries," she said.
However, the introduction of
the Melody Valve eliminated this

complication risk for Snider. She
said she was discharged from the
hospital the day after the proce-
dure and back at work the next
week.
Snider said that in the months
following the procedure, she felt
well and recuperated quickly.
She added that she leads a nor-
mal life and can participate in
one of her favorite hobbies, danc-
ing, with a church group.
"We perform three to four
times a month, and I've never
had problems," she said.
Snider added that with full
support from her doctors, she
and her husband were quickly
back on track to try to have chil-
dren.
"The doctors told us, 'Your
(artery) blockage is trivial. You
can start (having children) at
anytime.' That was just awesome
for us," she said.
A BIG ENDEAVOR TO
SAVE A LITTLE HEART
Two-year-old Mira Larrison
underwent heart surgery even
before she was born.
Due to a congenital heart con-
dition known as hypoplastic left
heart syndrome, the left side of
Mira's heart wasn't developing
properly when she was in her

mother's womb. Of more imme-
diate concern to doctors was the
lack of a hole between the two
sides of her heart, a defect that
was causing blood and pressure
buildup in the lungs.
"We felt that she was an
extremely high-risk patient,"
Armstrong, one of Mira's sur-
geons, said.
So when Mira's mother, Katie
Larrison of Algonac, Mich.,
reached the 30th week in her
pregnancy, doctors at Mott's
Congenital Heart Center decid-
ed in-utero intervention was
necessary to improve the baby's
condition. Katie underwent an
innovative surgery in December
2008 in which a team of Uni-
versity nurses and physicians,
including Armstrong, created a
hole between the left and right
atria of Mira's fetal heart.
Despite the risks - elevated
by Mira's Turner syndrome,
a rare chromosomal disorder
affecting approximately one in
2,500 females - the surgery
was successful, with Mira boast-
ing strong vital signs upon her
delivery the following January.
Acting quickly after the birth,
Armstrong began implementing
a plan that would involve addi-
tional procedures to carefully
"re-route" the infant's heart to

allow her right ventricle to do
the work of the faulty left ven-
tricle for the entire body.
With special attention paid to
Mira's Turner syndrome, Arm-
strong and Jennifer Hirsch, also
a pediatric cardiac surgeon at
Mott, performed multiple mini-
mally invasive procedures on
Mira in an effort to improve the
blood flow in her heart. Hypo-
plastic left heart syndrome can
never be fully corrected, Arm-
strong said, though surgeries like
this can improve heart function.
"We did newer, more innova-
tive hybrid procedures to 're-
route' the blood going through
her heart using stents and
bands," Armstrong explained.
Armstrong said she never
expected to make medical his-
tory by becoming one of the
first interventionalists in the
nation to perform this series of
unconventional surgeries on a
developing infant, both pre- and
post-delivery, and yield positive
results.
But even after her successful
procedures, Mira's health still
wasn't 100 percent.
"(Mira) was on a heart trans-
plant list for six months because
the pressure in her heart and
lungs was elevated, likely due to
the severe former heart disease,"

Armstrong said.
Six months later, though, Mira
showed significant improvement
as pressure normalized, bring-
ing the Larrisons some much-
needed relief as their daughter
was removed from the trans-
plant list.
With Mira back on track for
her series of surgeries, Katie
said she and her husband Jeremy
were nervous as Mira underwent
her next procedure at Mott, but
said they were comforted by the
preparedness of Mira's medical
team.
"(The doctors) would play out
different scenarios," Katie said.
"There was always a plan. We
always knew who was involved
in her care."
Armstrong said Mira may
need another surgery around
her third birthday. But for now,
Mira's life is steadily approach-
ing normalcy.
"She's much happier," Katie
said.
With an obvious tone of pride
in her voice, Katie added that
her daughter began to "scoot on
her butt" when she was about 20
months old.
"She's doing much better since
her surgery," Katie said, "(My
husband and I) have been able to
breathe more deeply."

Hearing the inner scream

Lavigne's' Lullaby'

T here'a a moment in Terry
Zwigoff's 1994 documen-
tary,"Crumb," when the subject,
legendary comic artist Robert
Crumb, pulls an old 78 from his
shelf and narrates:
"When I
listen to old
music, that's
one of the few
times I actu-
ally have a
kind of a love
for human-
ity. You hear JOE
the best part DIMUZIO
of the soul of
the common
people - their way of express-
ing their connection to eternity
or whatever you wanna call it.
Modern music doesn't have that
calamitous loss that people can't
express themselves that way
anymore, you know"
And when I see him lean back
against the wall, eyes open, lis-
tening to Geeshie Wiley's "Last
Kind Word Blues," I believe him.
I believe for a moment that we've
lost it. We really missed the
point, dropped the ball. Some
"calamitous loss" has been, well,
lost.
Later in the film, Crumb
roams the Haight neighborhood,
sketching locals both real and
imaginary - a man meditating
outside a corner store, a drunk
passed out on the toilet, beef
heads with Adidas logos embla-
zoned on their chests. He draws
portraits of commodified doom.
In his sketches, yuppies chat,
"Gosh isn't it a beautiful day?"
and headphones plaster every
ear. In one, chunky twenty-
somethings talk while a man
hangs, crucified. The title? "Hey,
I'm dyingup here."
Walking down the street with
his brother, Crumb says, "People

Fl

Avril's latest waxes
nostalgic but lacks
the emo touch
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Arts Writer
Something magical happened
in 2002 - something with the
power to change mainstream
music forever.
It was a time *
characterized
by bleach-blond AvdlILave
hair, scantily
clad women and Goodbye
provocative lyr- Lullaby
ics, as Christina
Aguilera and RCA
Britney Spears
ruled the charts with singles like
"Dirrty" and "I'm a Slave 4 U."
Nothing was too over-the-top
or erotic for the pop scene, a pop
scene with leading artists who
wore their sexual appetites as
proudly as their leather pants.
That is, until Avril Lavigne's
arrival. With her messy hair,
unconventional eye makeup and
too-cool-for-school attitude, she
ignited radio culture with the
desire to be different. Her album
Let Go, drenched in guitar riffs
and angst, drew in 13-year-olds
everywhere to the mystical alter-
native America. We wanted to be
sk8er bois and date rock stars in
lieu of dancing ballet. We wanted
to wear men's ties in our belt loops.
We even felt a sense of superior-
ity when we didn't hang out with
the popular kids at lunch - and
if any of our friends did, we were

entitled to label them "sellouts."
Avril Lavigne was our anti-estab-
lishment Barbie, making "uncool"
the new "cool" in a nation that
once drooled over mini-skirts and
platforms.
Now, nine years after she began
her campaign against "preppy
clothes" and social conventions,
the artist is trading in her baggy
jeans for a style more typical of
pop. Her newest album, Goodbye
Lullaby, packs enough romance,
sentiments and corny lyrics to
nourish a Taylor Swift song - a
far cry from the pop-punk prin-
cess image she tried to carve for
herself in the past.
With sugary-sweet tracks like
"I Love You," it's hard to believe
the artist behind Goodbye Lullaby
once encouraged us to wear Chuck
Taylors and clothing embossed
with chains. The song, like most
of the album, moves slowly and
tenderly with acoustic guitar and
soft vocals. It's a warm, personal
ballad and is complete with equal-
ly gooey lyrics: She includes fluffy
"La la la's," a list of the reasons she
loves her boyfriend and a four-
minute plea for him to always be
next to her. Though the poppy
romance style in "I Love You" is
atypical of Lavigne, each corny
line sounds genuine. Even the
revoltingly affectionate "reason I
love you is you" refrain is convinc-
ing - impressive from an artist
once known for teaming up with
Missy Elliot and chasing after
another girl's boyfriend.
That's not to say that Goodbye
Lullaby doesn't contain traces of
Avril's former defiant side. Her
attempts to hang onto her past

image are clear in songs like
"Smile," which bounces with per-
cussion and a faster pace. Even
with its spunky sound, however,
the track's tough-girl attitude
feels forced and feeble.The"edgy"
vibe is immediately offset by the
song's generic lyrics, featuring
cringe-worthy lines like "You
know that I'm a crazy bitch" and
"I do what I want when I feel like
it." The track just doesn't sound
believable or natural on the album
- especially when surrounded by
songs with titles like "Darlin" and
"Wish You Were Here."
Preteens of this decade may
need tolook to'violentvideogames
and R-rated movies for their serv-
ing of nonconformity, because
Goodbye Lullaby doesn't deliver
the same punch as past Avril
Lavigne work. Instead, the album
reveals a sentimental side of the'
artist - one that was covered in
layers of eyeliner years ago. The
album sounds natural in its vul-
nerability and sappiness, which
poses a devastating question for
Let Go fans: Was the sk8er girl we
worshiped in middle school really
as tough as we thought?

To me, the inner scream is a
production of the id - it's the
unknowable essence of self talk-
ing, communicating something,
singing.
So if 51-year-old Robert
Crumb's monopolized ideal of
the inner scream exists solely
in Geeshie Wiley and old Char-
ley Patton 78s, good for him.
But that "calamitous loss," that
"inner scream," that "soul of the
common people" - pop music

At the end of the movie, Crumb
moves to France - he's had it
with America. He watches anx-
iously as moving men as stocky
as his Haight sketches pack his
precious 78s - into a massive
truck. "Not I" ends with a fade,
no conclusion, an endless scream.
The cycle goes on and on.

College basketball needs
more John Beileins

Feel free to criticize John
Beilein as a coach all you
want.
Personally, I'll consider you
an idiot if you do. Thankfully,
though, with
the Wolver- BEN
ines' shocking ESTES
performance
this season, I On Basketball
think the cries
of rabble-rousing Michigan fans
calling for Beilein's head have
been finally - and rightfully -
reduced to nothing more than a
whimper.
But even those people with an
apparent vendetta against Beilein
- the ones that wanted him fired
after one down season, whenthe
expectations were too high for the
team anyway - have to recognize
and appreciate whatthe Michigan
coach represents.
I love college basketball, but,
like all sports these days, it's
becoming increasingly suscep-
tible to corrupting forces. A lot of
coaches are more than willingto
take advantage of that.
Kentucky coach John Calipari
is lauded as one of the top men
in his profession, and his results
certainly speak to that. But a
basketball public and a national
media - all too easily blinded
by wins and championships -
seem to conveniently forget that
wherever Calipari has stopped
as a head coach, NCAA allega-
tions have followed in hiswake
(and he's already been in several
recruitmentcgray areas in his two
seasons at Kentucky).

Jim Calhoun is already in the
Basketball Hall of Fame, and
deservedly so. But his plaque
doesn't include the recruiting
violations that the NCAA recently
found him guilty of at Con-
necticut. And Rick Stansbury has
found success at Mississippi State
- but with the ongoing Renardo
Sidney saga, it's clear the coach
is willing to sell his soul for more
wins.
But Beilein breaks that mold.
Some are appalled that the man
doesn't embrace the win-at-all-
costs mentality that many - too
many - of his peers have adopted.
Of course Bellein wants to win,
but he does it the right way.
Beilein will never recruit some-
one like Sidney. Those type of
high-caliber players - brought up
in a corrosive AAU culture shad-
ier than Bernie Madoff, carrying
more baggage (read: potential vio-
lations) than a 747 airplane - rep-
resent a slippery slope down the
gray areas of college basketball.
I'm not saying Beilein won't
recruit good prospects,just not
those athletes whose commit-
ments come at the cost of selling
out one's character. Heck, he even
avoided talking publicly about
his own son when he played in
high school, for fear of breaking
obscure NCAA rules.
John Beilein still takes to heart
what the core values of amateur
athletics are supposed to be.
The term student-athlete actu-
ally means something in Beilein's
lexicon - he genuinely cares
about how well his players do

academically, recognizingthat a
college degree is just asvaluable
as a Final Four berth in the long
run. In fact, when trying to figure
out travel arrangements to Ohio
State this season in the face of the
looming Snowpocalypse, players
missing as little class as possible
was an important factor in the
team's plans.
For Beilein, college basketball
is about developing his pupils
both as players and as men. He
talks alot about his team being a
family, but he's not justblowing
smoke. These Wolverines are his
first group composed of solely
his recruits - players who want
to play the rightway, who want
to learn, who want to grow with
their teammates - and their
chemistry is readily apparent in
the locker room.
Why do you think all these
NBA fathers are sending their
sons to play for John Beilein?
Because they knowthat after four
years of his coaching, teaching
and benevolence, they'll emerge
ready to play pro ball if they're
talented enough, ready to enter
the business world if that's their
calling - ready for any challenge
in life.
As the NCAA continues to care
more and more about its profits,
as other coaches continue to care
more and more about their own
individual success, Beilein stands
out asa positive force - fans of
all teams should take heart that
coaches like him still exist.
That's why Saturday's post-
game scene was so gratifying for

college basketball fans who still
care about class. There was Tom
Izzo, ripping an opposing player
when his own teams have done
far worse than making a contest-
ed layup at the end of a five-point
game. There was the Michigan
State coach, begrudgingly com-
plimenting Michigan with all the
genuineness and grace of a sore
loser.
But then there was Beilein,
constantly praising his opponent,
turning down several opportuni-
ties to campaign for an NCAA
Tournament berth, answering
each question calmly and hum-
bly despite notching the biggest
rivalry win for the Wolverines in
years.
Perhaps I'm out of touch; per-
haps it's time to recognize what
college sports are turning into,
and it's time for the Wolverines to
join up or get left in the dust.
But as students here, we should
be proud that we're abovethe sys-
tem. Call it stereotypical Michi-
gan arrogance, but I refuse to
apologize for still wanting to play
by the rules, for still hoping that
true amateurism can someday
return to our sports culture.
If you still don't think Beilein is
the best coach for Michigan - if
you want him gone, or want the
Wolverines to join the Kentuckys
and Connecticuts in the moral
basement of the NCAA - by all
means, feel free to start crying
out "Sparty on!," or to go join the
Ohio State bandwagon.
You probably belong there
anyway.

The Michigan baseball
team has its fair share
of excuses it could use
for its early season struggles.
Some - you could even argue
- carry some weight.
The Wolverines (2-9) have
yet to
play a DANIEL
home WASSERMAN
game,
and On Baseball
recently
concluded a 10-day road trip
during which the team played
nine games spanning across
two time zones.
Two starting pitchers -
senior right-handers Kolby
Wood and Travis Smith - have
been severely hampered by
injuries.
Michigan played what
coach Rich Maloney called the
toughest pre-Big Ten schedule
the team has ever faced -
opening up against two top-25
teams.
Youth and inexperience
have played a big role in the
Wolverines' lineup.
Michigan's opening-day
lineup consisted of seven
underclassmen and redshirt
junior first baseman Garrett
Stephens, who came into the
year with only two career
starts at first base. The young
players have big shoes to fill,
with five MLB draft picks and
former All-Big Ten first base-
man Mike Dufek gone.
On top of all that, the Wol-
verines still haven't been able
to practice outdoors. Instead,
they're confined to Oosterbaan
Field House, where they can't
even field live balls.
With that said, it's time for
the excuses to stop.
"It's only a matter of time,"
freshman left fielder Michael
O'Neill said after-Sunday's
8-0 loss to Sam Houston State.
"Guys are making good pitches
and we just haven't gotten any
breaks yet. Once we start get-
ting some breaks and putting
together timely hitting, we'll
be fine."
While O'Neill is searching
for optimism - and who can
blame him, he's just a fresh-
man - Michigan has bigger
problems than the breaks
going the wrong way.
In 11 games, the Wolverines
have been outscored 90-49. If
you take out Michigan's two
wins this season - both of
which came against winless
Massachusetts - the Wolver-
ines are getting beaten by an
average score of about 9-3.
Thus far, the most glar-
ing weakness been pitching.
Left-hander Bobby Brosnahan,
Michigan's ace, is 0-3 with

an ERA of 12.51, while he has
allowed as many walks -
seven - as strikeouts.
The lefty has struggled to
find any confidence. Even in
a rare bullpen appearance
Sunday, he surrendered seven
earned runs in 2.2 innings.
Brosnahan isn't the only
starter that's struggling thus
far. Only one starter - sopho-
more right-hander Tyler Mills
- has pitched past the fifth
inning.
And in five games, the start-
ing pitcher has pitched only
three innings or less. To say
the bullpen has been ove
worked and overwhelmed thus
far would be an understate-
ment.
This upcoming weekend
will be very telling in how the
young Wolverines can respond
to adversity.
Michigan will travel to Rock
Hill, S.C. for the Bojangles
Baseball Classic, where they'll
face host Winthrop (5-5) and
Stony Brook (2-4) - both win-
nable games.
After the Wolverines were
picked to finish second in the
Big Ten, few would've pre-
dicted Michigan to start the
season on such a sluggish note.
But the season is still young,
with plenty of room left to get
on track. There's no better
example of this than the Wol-
verine basketball team, which
responded from a 1-6 start in
conference play and now is in
position to make the NCAA
Tournament.
"Early in the year they lost
six games, and that could've
snowballed into something
even greater, and then they
probably wouldn't have found
themselves in the position
thepre in now," Maloney said
of the basketball team, which
also entered the season young
and inexperienced.
"But they fought through
that adversity in an admirable
way."
With the Wolverines'
dreams of a successful start to
the season long gone, it's going
to take more than just a few
good bounces to turn things
around entering conference
play, which begins Mar. 25.
"There's some things that
are going to have to change,"
O'Neill later admitted. "We
keep saying that things are
goingto be okay and things
are going to get better, and
I strongly believe that they
are, but we're going to have to
make that happen."
There's no doubt that Michi-
gan has the talent to bounce
back. The question is, do they
have the confidence?

Michigan boasts top defensive unit in CCHA

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team

ground for elite offensive talent.
And when the Wolverines win,
it's hard to argue that point.
But in the eyes of the coach-
ing staff and players, Michigan
no longer craves that label - it
wants to be known for boasting
a top-level defense and churning
out two-way players.
"Most people in the hockey
world would talk about our
offense, our speed and our skill,"
Michigan associate head coach
Mel Pearson said Monday. "I
think sometimes our defense
gets overlooked, even though the
coaches in the program preach
that we want to be the best defen-
sive team in our league - or the
country - every year."
And the Wolverines (20-7-1-0
CCHA, 23-9-4 overall) certainly
have an argument. The defen-
sive unit closed out the season
against Northern Michigan with
an emphatic 5-0 shutout on Feb.
26, simultaneously giving Michi-
gan the top spot in the CCHA

and the conference's best defense
- boasting a 2.04 goals-against
average.
It's the second time in three
years that the Wolverines have
been the league's least-scored-
upon defense.
"When everyone thinks Mich-
igan hockey, theythink Michigan
recruits the top offensive guys,"
senior defenseman Chad Lan-
glais said Monday. "And it's true,
to a certain extent, but in the last
few years we haven't been the
offensive dynamo that Michigan
is used to being.
"I think we've made up for that
defensively without being recog-
nized."
Michigan might be changing
its M.O., but this wasn't supposed
to be the year of the defensemen.
This is a defensive corps that
entered the 2010-11 campaign
having lost NHL-caliber defen-
semen Steve Kampfer and Chris
Summers - both seniors last sea-
son who have appeared for stints
in the NHL this season - while
returning just two seniors.
With three incoming fresh-
men entering the lineup and
every defensive pairing shifting,

there were supposed to be a few
hiccups.
"You always have some con-
cerns when you have freshmen
comingin," Pearson said. "I think
it's the hardest position to play
in college hockey, with the rules
and the speed of the game."
Added junior defenseman
Brandon Burlon: "You have to be
able to adapt to different situa-
tions, different players. You never
know from one day to the next.
Guys have to come in and assume
different roles sometimes."
Surprisingly, Michigan had
very few troubles, thanks in part
to freshman defenseman Jon
Merrill, who never relinquished
his opening-day spot on the top
defensive pairing with Langlais
- ultimately being named to the
CCHA All-Rookie Team on Mon-
day.
"I think Jon Merrill, from day
one, was prepared and ready to
play, and a lot better defensively
than I think we even gave him
credit for," Pearson said.
But the defense did hit a sig-
nificant speed bump in mid-Jan-
uary, when senior defenseman
Tristin Llewellyn was dismissed

from the team for what Michigan
coach Red Berenson described
as a "violation of team expecta-
tions."
Down to only one senior on
defense, Berenson turned to
freshmen defensemen Mac Ben-
nett and Kevin Clare to fill the
void.
"We felt all eight defensemen
were all very capable of playing,
it was almost like we had too
many players - it's like having
five quarterbacks and only being
able to play one," Pearson said. "I
think when (Llewellyn) departed
it gave an opportunity for the
other kids to step in, and they
took advantage of it."
While Bennett has since
assumed most of the playing
time, on a team fielding just one
extra defenseman, Clare hasn't
skipped a beat. In Clare's 12
games this season, Michigan is
an undefeated 9-0-3.
"We have the most confidence
in all of our (defensemen), no
matter how many games or min-
utes they've played," Langlais
said. "We know every one of us
can step in and play a vital role on
this team."

Freshman defenseman Jan Merrill was named to the AII-Roskie CCHA team.

And it's not just the defense-
men that can be credited with
the team's newfound defensive
prowess. As Berenson reminds
the press after nearlyeverygame,
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick's goalmouth acrobatics are
as pivotal to the defense as the

blue-line grinders.
"From the beginning of the
year Coach Berenson really
stressed team defense," Merrill
said. "I think that's somewhere
we've really grown as ateam and
it's become almost our team iden-
tity."
