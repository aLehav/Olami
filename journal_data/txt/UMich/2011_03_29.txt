Provost seeks
opinions on Dept.
of Education's
proposed changes
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Though each school in the
University requires a specific
number of credit hours before
a student can graduate, there
has been controversy in the past
about what exactly constitutes a
credit hour.
University Provost Philip
Hanlon asked members of the
leading faculty governing body
for informal recommendations
about credit hour requirements
at the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs meeting
in the Fleming Administration
Building yesterday. A move by
the federal government to define
credit hours could affect student
financial aid funding and gradu-
ation requirements, Hanlon told
the faculty members.
The U.S. Department of Edu-
cation proposed defining credit
hours last June. The proposed

regulations would impact Uni-
versity accreditation and access
to student financial aid because
the more credit hours a student
takes, the more funding he or
she can receive in most cases,
accordingto a Council for Higher
Education Accreditation Federal
Update from June 28.
Hanlon said the rules defin-
ing a credit hour were set by
the Department of Education
in October, but the American
Council on Education has asked
the department to reconsider
guidelines. He said he wanted to
bring the issue to the attention of
SACUA members and hear their
opinions onwhere the University
stands.
If the Department of Educa-
tion declines to reconsider, the
guidelines determined in Octo-
ber will take effect on July 1,
according to the timeline estab-
lished in the Federal Update.
The Department of Educa-
tion wants to require two hours
of outside work for every hour of
time spent in a class that is more
than 15 weeks long, Hanlon said.
For research, the requirement
would be two hours of work out-
side of a laboratory.

Editor's Note: This is thefirst
of a three-part seriers about
mental health issues on college
campuses.
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
For many students, exam
preparation and writing papers
takes up the majority of week-
ends, and home is just a place to
rest between library visits.
The effects of grueling

schedules on students' mental
health has become increasingly
examined by mental health
professionals. However, while
depression and anxiety may be
a part of students' daily lives,
experts aren't sure if these con-
ditions have resulted in more
mental health issues on col-
lege campuses. Measuring the
trend is difficult, mental health
experts say, due to factors like
the reduction in stigma of psy-
chological health problems.

Other confounding factors -
such as an increase in the num-
ber of students seeking help and
easier access to medications -
can cause growing awareness
of mental health issues to be
mistaken for increased occur-
rence. But many mental health
professionals still believe the
trend exists.

ciate professor in the Univer-

Restaurants and other busi-
nesses in the South State Street

area were forced to close their
doors early last night when a
power surge left them in the
dark.
DTE Energy spokesman John
Austerberry said in an inter-
view last night that the outage
impacted mostly parts of East
Liberty Street, East Washington
Street and South State Street
and began at about 7:20 p.m. due
to an underground cable failure.

About 200 DTE customers were
affected, Austerberry said, add-
ing that he was unsure how long
it would take the company to fix
the issue.
"We have crews working on
it and really can't say with many

Alcoholic energy
drinks banned by
state in November
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
A non-caffeinated ver-
sion of Four Loko has legally
found its way back onto con-
venience store shelves after
being banned in Michigan last
November.

The old version of the drink
- sometimes referred to as
"blackout in a can" - was
banned by the Michigan Liquor
Control Commission because
its , mix of alcohol and caf-
feine was deemed dangerous
to consumers. The beverage
contained about as much alco-
hol as four beers and the same
amount of caffeine as three to
four cups of coffee.
A press release issued in
November by Phusion Projects
- the company that makes Four

Loko - stated that the original
Four Loko product was safe
since drinks like rum and cola
have been around for years
without contention. The com-
pany also stressed that it clearly
prints the alcohol content and
warnings on every item it sells
and that it isn't in the business
of selling dangerous products.
According to the Phusion
Projects website, the company
decided to remove caffeine,
guarana and taurine from its

Ancient texts not getting old

When gathering honks
for research papers, many
students are accustomed to
thumbing through the stacks
of the Harlan Matcher Gradu-
ate Library. But less known are
the rare and wide ranging col-
lections within the library.
The Graduate Lihrary is
home to some of the largest
collections of certain mediums
including maps and papyrus.
The Map Library contains
more than 370,000 maps - the
largest amount in the state -
and 10,000 atlases and refer-
ence works, according to Liene
Karels, director of marketing
communications for University
Libraries.
Also housed in the Gradu-

ate Library is ehe University's
Papyrology Collection, which
contains more than 7,000
works and 12,000 other pieces
of papyrus. These works com-
prise the world's fifth largest
collection of papyrus artifacts,
Karels said.
Students can view the Papy-
rology Collection through
tours, Karels said, but stu-
dents are free to visit the Map
Lihrary as they please. The
Map Library also offers themed
events on the third Tuesday of
every month in which visitors
view a specific map.
But the two collections
are just a small part of what
the Graduate Lihrary offers.
Located on the seventh floor

is the University's Special Col-
lections Library, which is home
to original copies and rare edi-
t1ons of works by writers such
as John Milton, Charles Dick-
ens, William Faulkner, Wil-s
liam Butler Yeats and Robert s
Frost.
Other literary artifacts can
be found in the Audobon Room
in the Graduate Library's Main
Gallery. These works are from
the 13th and 14th centuries
and include art by the room's
namesake, John James Audo-
bon. Audobon's work was also
the inspiration for the wall-
paper of the newly renovated
Bert's Cafe Study Lounge.

NYU to build new
Shanghai campus
New York University has
announced that it will create
a degree-granting liberal arts
campus in Shanghai.
NYU Shanghai is scheduled
to open in the fall of 2013. It will
eventually enroll 3,000 under-
graduate, graduate and profes-
sional students.
Classes will be taught in Eng-
4 lish. About 40-50 percent of the
students will come from China.
It will be the school's second
major international campus.
Last year, NYU opened a school
in Abu Dhabi in United Arab
Emirates. It also has a dozen
smaller programs in other coun-
tries.
NYU has also embarked on
an ambitious plan to expand
its campus at home. The school
plans grow its campus by 6 mil-
lion square feet over the next two
decades.
SAN DIEGO, Calif.
Thieves steal
$44,000 of lawn
art, statues
San Diego County authorities
are looking for art thieves who
have made off with at least 18
metal, wood and concrete statues
- including a 600-pound bronze
moose.
The North County Times
reports the thieves have stolen
nearly $44,000 worth of lawn art
since October. Most of the thefts
occurred in San Marcos and
Ramona.
The artworks included Bud-
dha yard statutes, a life-sized
aluminum colt, a 3-foot-tall
statue of the Virgin Mary and a
copper statue of three children
valued at $15,000.
Detectives suspect that the
metal works may have been bro-
ken up and sold to recyclers,

while the other pieces might
have been resold.

Yemen's chaos deepened yes-
terday when people looting a
munitions factory set off an acci-
dental explosion that killed at
least 78 in an area torn from gov-
ernment control by Islamist mili-
tants exploiting the president's
rapidly dwindling power.
The militant seizure of the fac-
tory and nearby towns amplified
Western fears that the fragile
Yemeni state could deteriorate
quickly because of President Ali
Abdullah Saleh's standoff with
an opposition coalition of youth
groups, military defectors, clerics
and tribal leaders calling for his
ouster.
Saleh has cooperated closely
with the U.S. in the battle against
Yemen's branch of al-Qaida,
which has used areas of Yemen

attacks including the attempt to
bomb a Detroit-bound airliner

Auto industry to
suffer damages
from Japan quake

on Thursday, March 7.

Japanese factories
shut down from
natural disaster
TOKYO (AP) - The auto
industry disruptions triggered
by Japan's earthquake and tsu-
nami will worsen in the coming
weeks.
Car buyers will have difficul-
ty finding the model they want
in certain colors, thousands of
auto plant workers will likely
be told to stay home, and com-
panies such as Toyota, Honda
and others will lose billions of
dollars in revenue. More than
two weeks since the natural
disaster, inventories of crucial
car supplies - from computer
chips to paint pigments - are
dwindling fast as Japanese fac-
tories that make them struggle
to restart.
Because parts and supplies
are shipped by slow-moving
boats, the real drop-off has yet
to be felt by factories in the
U.S., Europe and Asia. That will

come by the middle of April.
"This is the biggest impact
ever in the history of the auto-
mobile industry," said Koji Endo,
managing director at Advanced
Research Japan in Tokyo.
Much of Japan's auto indus-
try - the second largestsupplier
of cars in the world - remains
idle. Few plants were seriously
damaged by the quake, but with
supplies of water and electricity
fleeting, no one can say when
factories will crank up. Some
auto analysts said it could be as
late as this summer.
There are signs, though, that
things might not be as bad as
analysts are predicting. Nissan
Motor Co., which has seen pro-
duction stop in several areas,
said Monday that it expects fac-
tories to be back in operation in
weeks rather than months.
The company has studied all
of its parts suppliers and com-
panies that supply parts to them
and has determined that the
situation isn't as dire as some
predictions, spokesman Brian
Brockman said yesterday.

Five-week walkout
increased talks of
legislative issues
across the state
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -
Indiana House Democrats who
fled the state five weeks ago to
protest a Republican agenda
they considered an assault on
labor unions and public educa-
tion returned to the Statehouse
yesterday to resume work.
Minority Leader Patrick
Bauer said he and his fellow
Democrats ended one of the
longest legislative walkouts in
recent U.S. history after win-
ning concessions from Repub-
licans over recent weeks on
several issues.
"We're coming back after
softening the radical agenda,"
said Bauer, D-South Bend,
whose return was greeted by
cheering union workers. "We
won a battle, but we recognize
the war goes on."
Republican House Speaker
Brian Bosma gaveled in the
chamber early yesterday eve-
ning, giving the House its first
quorum since Democrats fled to
Illinois on Feb. 22.
"It's refreshing and pleas-
ant to see a full chamber," he
said.
But what Democrats actually
achieved with the walkout is a
matter of debate. The conces-
sions are likely more than Dem-
ocrats would have gained had
they not boycotted - but won't
stop the GOP agenda.
Republicans had vowed
throughout the standoff that
they wouldn't remove items
from their agenda, and by and
large they won't have to. The

only bill actually killed by the
boycott was a "right-to-work"
proposal that would prohibit
union representation fees from
being a condition of employ-
ment.
GOP legislators agreed to
some changes on several other
bills. For example, they agreed
to cap for two years the num-
ber of students who could par-
ticipate in a voucher program
usingtaxpayer moneyto attend
private schools - but it would
still be among the nation's
most expansive use of vouchers
when the limits expire. Repub-
licans also agreed last week to
reduce the number of govern-
ment projects that would be
exempt from the state's pre-
vailing construction wage law,
but the amended bill is still
expected to pass.
The Democrats' most signifi-
cant achievement may be that
people across the state are talk-
ing about these issues. Bauer
said the public needed a "time-
out" to learn about the agenda
pushed by Republicans who took
sweepingcontrol of the House in
2010 elections.
Thousands of people attend-
ed Statehouse rallies during
the walkout, and hundreds of
people attended local town
hall meetings. Many teachers
said they didn't realize Repub-
licans supported vouchers and
other measures they think will
erode public education, and
some union members said they
wished they had voted.
In that sense, Democrats
"punched above their weight,"
said Robert Dion, who teaches
politics at the University of
Evansville.
"They got the attention of
the state, and they were able to
finagle some meaningful con-

cessions that I don't think were
necessarily offered all that will-
ingly," Dion said.
On the other hand, Dion said,
Democrats have a bit of a black
eye because the walkout lasted
so long.
The Democrats had fled
to protest 11 pieces of legisla-
tion, denying the House the
two-thirds of members present
needed to do business, since
the state constitution requires a
quorum to conduct any official
business.
Indiana's boycott began a
week after Wisconsin's Demo-
cratic senators left for Illinois
in their three-week boycott
against a law barring most pub-
lic employees from collective
bargaining. Wisconsin Repub-
licans used a parliamentary
maneuver to pass the law with-
out them, and the matter now is
headed to court.
The Indiana standoff got a
bit nasty at times - with name-
calling, scathing political ads,
rowdy rallies and fines total-
ing more than $3,000 for most
absent Democrats - but last
week Republicans and Demo-
crats seemed to tone down the
rhetoric.
The walkout had the poten-
tial to force a special session or
even a government shutdown
if a new budget wasn't adopted
before July 1. Bosma predicted
that lawmakers would have
plenty of late nights as they
work toward the scheduled end
of the regular legislative session
April 29.
"It's long past time to get to
the people's business," Bosma
said. "Hopefully we can make
this work in five short weeks."
Bosma said he didn't consider
the changes to the government
projects bill substantive.

Fishermen barricade
harbor from migrants

15,000 migrants
enter Italy in
wake of North
Africa uprisings
LAMPEDUSA, Italy (AP) -
Exasperated Italian fishermen
towed empty boats seized from
illegal immigrants across the
entrance of Lampedusa's harbor
on yesterday to try to prevent
any other vessels carrying North
Africans from reaching the tiny
island in the Mediterranean Sea.
Other islanders overturned
garbage bins to protest the relent-
less arrival of illegal immigrants,
including many now coming from
Libyan shores.
"Enough, we're full," read a
slogan scrawled on a white sheet
and carried by two protesters.
More than 3,000 new migrants
have arrived in the last three days
alone on the island of 5,000 resi-
dents, which lives off tourism and
fishing. With the shelters on the
island full, the migrants, many of
them Tunisian men who fled the
unrest in their homeland, have
taken to sleeping on the docks or
in makeshift tent camps in fields.

The island has been flooded
with more than 15,000 migrants
since mid-January, when Tuni-
sians overthrew their longtime
strongman, but hundreds have
been transferred to centers in
other parts of Italy. The island is
60 miles (100 kilometers) east of
the Tunisian coast, closer to Afri-
can than the Italian mainland.
As local women cheered, the
fishermen on Monday pulled the
migrants' seized boats across
the harbor. The migrants simply
watched from land, their laun-
dry flapping from improvised
clotheslines.
The migrants' boats - often
open-topped wooden fishing ves-
sels purchased from smugglers -
are spotted far offshore by Italian
coast guard air and sea patrols,
whose motorboats then escort the
migrants to the island. Monday's
blockade was a mostly symbolic
act, since few migrants' boats
have entered the small port or
docked by themselves at Lampe-
dusa.
Angry islanders knocked over
garbage bins along the roads
Monday and several women
chained themselves together,
shouting that the migrants should
no longer be broughtto shore.

Gov. Snyder passes law to
cut unemployment benefits

Michigan jobless
benefits to decrease
from 26 to 20 weeks
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Gov.
Rick Snyder yesterday made
Michigan the first state in the
country to lower the number
of weeks jobless workers canx
get state benefits, a trend other
cash-strapped states may follow
as a way to avoid taxing busi-
nesses more for unemployment
benefits.
Snyder said he signed the bill
reducing state benefits from
26 to 20 weeks because it will
allow people out of a job now
to get up to 20 more weeks of
help from a federal program for
those who used up their state
and most of their regular fed-
eral unemployment benefits.
The change will allow them to
extend unemployment benefits
to 99 weeks.
Those last 20 weeks of feder-
al benefits would have expired
for 35,000 Michigan residents
in early April and for 150,000
residents by the end of 2011 if
Snyder hadn't signed the bill by
Friday.
"Cuttingthem off so abruptly
would have jeopardized the
well-being of those who are try-

ing hard to find work," Snyder
said in a release after signing
the bill in private.
But critics, including Michi-
gan's entire Democratic con-
gressional delegation, said the
Republican governor should
have vetoed the bill rather than
sign cuts in state jobless benefits
into law. Nearly every state has
offered at least 26 weeks of ben-
efits for the past half-century,
and Michigan's unemployment
rate has been one of the nation's
highest for the past five years.
"Gov. Snyder's decision to
sign this reckless measure cut-
ting the lifeline for Michigan's
unemployed will reverberate
for years in Michigan," U.S.
Rep. Sander Levin of Royal Oak
said in a release. "Republicans
hijacked a simple technical
change to extend 100 percent
federally funded benefits this
year and gave Michigan the
dubious distinction of becoming
the only state in the union with
20 weeks of state unemploy-
ment insurance."
A letter urging Snyder to veto
the bill was signed by Michi-
gan's two U.S. senators, Carl
Levin and Debbie Stabenow,
as well as Democratic Reps.
Hansen Clarke, John Conyers,
John Dingell, Dale Kildee, Gary
Peters and Sander Levin.

"Michigan would be the only
state to have 20 weeks of state
unemployment insurance and
the first state to reduce benefits
during a period of high unem-
ployment. These are two dis-
tinctions we do not want for
our state," they wrote in the let-
ter. They noted that Michigan's
action could cause federal bene-
fits to be reduced by an addition-
al 16 weeks in Michigan, possibly
costing jobless workers 22 weeks
of state and federal benefits.
Michigan added 71,000 jobs
between February 2010 and last
month, the first sustained job
gain the state has seen inthe past
decade, and its unemployment
rate has taken the biggest tumble
of any state in the country over
the past year, from 13.5 percent
to 10.4 percent.
Still, finding a job isn't easy.
Michigan last year ranked third-
highest nationally inthe percent-
age of unemployed workers who
had been looking for a job for a
year or more - 36 percent out of
590,000 workers, according to
the federal Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics.
State Democratic lawmakers
supported the extension of the
federal benefits but voted against
the overall plan because of the
other changes to the state jobless
benefits system.

'Hard' rules
State's protective custody law needs revision
mix-up over a bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade resulted
in a distressing custody ordeal and current lawsuit
for a University professor and his family. The incident
occurred in April 2008 when Christopher Ratte, an associate
professor of classical archeology and history of art, purchased
lemonade for his son, Leo, at a Detroit Tigers's game, unaware
of the drink's 5-percent alcohol content. Leo was seized by a
security guard in the ninth inning and placed into the care of
Children's Protective Services. The American Civil Liberties
Union recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ratte's family in
U.S. District Court, asking the court to change a state law that
allows for a child to be taken from his or her parents without
proof that the child is in immediate danger. This law needs to
be changed to preserve the rights of families.

Don't eliminate the electives

loved high school. And this
statement isn't only something
I can say in retrospect, tinted by
the lens of nostal-
gia since I wasn't
incredibly popu-
lar or anything.
I was a good stu-
dent and a good
athlete, just like
many of my col-
legefriends atthe
University were MARY
when they were DEMERY
in high school.
The reason I
enjoyed high school as it unfolded
was mostly because I went to a really
good public school that offered tons
of interesting courses and sports
teams that had 0.500 records. I
took courses such as ceramics and
advanced painting and played bas-
ketball, volleyball and ran track. For
the most part, these activities were
free to me. Around my junior year,
due to budget cuts, a pay-to-play fee
of $50 per sport was introduced to all
athletes, but this was something my
middle class family handled in stride
(today the fee is $90 per sport). Now
I see these options as individualized
opportunities: They are what I chose
to spend my elective credits and my
free time on. They supplemented the
standard math, science, history and
English courses.
At the time, though, they certain-
ly didn't feel like privileges. They
were natural parts of my routine: I
had painting every other day and
volleyball practice each day after
school. Again through the lens of
retrospect, I find myself thinking
about- and missing-these parts of
my high school experience the most.
Today, the idea of having a high
school experience like mine is
laughable. This is because it's now
financially implausible - or it will

be if Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
proposed budget cuts to education
are carried out. My alma mater, the
Berkley School District in Berkley,
Mich., would lose about $900 dol-
lars per student after cuts. This
means that nextyear, with increased
expenditures and reduced revenue,
the school district will lose a stag-
gering $4.3 million, according to
the district's website. Even if the
district cut the entire K-12 music
program and all middle and high
school athletic programs, the funds
saved would only cover 35 percent
of the $4.3 million. Like many other
schools across the state, educators
face a task I don't envy. Cuts are
coming, whether they like it or not,
and preparations must be made. But
what to cut? Which parts of a child's
education do we value more than
others? Why?
As expected, most districts have
to turn to the usual suspects of art,
music, gym, after school programs
and athletics - anything "extra."
This isn't because the educators
themselves don't value these sub-
jects. But they have little choice: You
can't cut chemistry. Likewise, you
can't fire the teachers - though you
can get rid of any who specialize in
art, music or any other extras.
I'm worried about what will hap-
pen if and when "the extras" are cut.
This issue is particularly trouble-
some for me, since so much of my
time in high school was spent in the
gym and the art studio. I can't imag-
ine a high school experience without
these things. I don't want to. While I
understand that Michigan is in seri-
ous financial trouble, I just can't pic-
ture high schooL withoutathletics.
I can't imagine walking past my old
ceramics classroom, now empty, the
wheels dusty from disuse.
Taking away these things is tak-
ing away a core part of a student's

education. This is the biggest con-
sequence of Snyder's proposed cuts.
An education consisting of only the
four basic subjects isn't a compre-
hensive education. And the results
won't be pretty either: I see a mass
of uninterested, burnt out students
who don't really care about learn-
ing. And why shouldthey?Eachtime
their government makes debilitating
cuts to education it shows just how
highly itvalues their schooling.
'Extra' activities
are essential
to education.
But another very serious ramifi-
cation will emerge from these cuts.
Art, music and sports - all so won-
derful because everyone can partici-
pate - will become distinguished by
socioeconomic class. If we cut art
programs, only students who can
afford to take lessons at nearby art
centers will be able to pursue art. If
schools raise the already high pay-
to-play sports fee, only students who
can afford to pay upward of $90 per
sport will be able to play. Worse still,
if we cut athletic programs, only
students who can afford to pay for
Amateur Athletic Union basketball
will have a chance to develop any
athletic potential.
High school shouldn't be bare
bones, nor should a student's expe-
rience be limited by the amount of
moryhisor her parents make. But
that's where we're heading, with
Snyder's proposed budget cuts.

Ratte had never heard of Mike's Hard Lem-
onade, and when he saw the concession sign
that read "Mike's Lemonade," he assumed
that it was just that - lemonade. Ratte was
approached by a security guard at the game,
who saw Leo drinking the beverage and
insisted on taking Leo to the police. A medi-
cal examination that day revealed no trace
of alcohol in Leo's blood. Despite Leo being
deemed healthy, his family was not permitted
to contact him, and he was placed in foster
care after spending the night at Children's
Protective Services. After further ordeals,
Leo's mother - Claire Zimmerman, an archi-
tecture professor at the University - was
able to regain custody of her son and even-
tually the charges against her husband were
dropped.
Ratte made a serious error in judgment in
givinghi ehild Mike's HardLemonade, but it
was an honest mistake. The assumption made
by the police and Department of Human Ser-
vices officials that he was knowingly giving
his son alcohol is absurd, and their reaction
was extreme. The security official was right
to intervene, but taking a small child away
from his family wasn't only rash but also trau-

matic and damaging for the child.
The ACLU is rightfully accusing the police
officers and DHS officials of violating the
rights of Leo and his family. The officials
were following a Michigan law that seems to
stand in contrast to the due process clause of
the 14th Amendment, which requires that in
the absence of a valid court order, a child can
only be removed under "exigent circumstanc-
es" or when the child faces "imminent dan-
ger." The state law is extreme in that it doesn't
require officers to consider placing the child
under the care of a non-offending parent.
Leo's mother begged officials to put Leo
in her custody, but they refused, even though
she wasn't at the Tiger's game and had no
involvement with the incident. While it's
important to keep children safe, this law is
rash and assumes that separating a child from
his entire family is always inthe bestwateat
of the child, which is certainly not the case.
The policy of protective care workers and
police officers shouldn't be to take children
away first and ask questions later. There
needs to be a responsible policy in place that
protects children and remains in line with
the rights of families.

Messy Scandalous Assembly 9

It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine.
Ever since my first football game freshman
year, that phrase has stayed near my heart. I
have loved this school since I can remember.
The day I received my admissions letter (Dec.
11,2008-in caseyouwerewondering), mylife
changed. I knew that my undergraduate years
at the University would be full of wonderful
opportunities that I could not wait to partake
in. Right away, I knew that one of those activi-
ties would be joining a learning community.
With that in mind, I decided to join the Michi-
gan Community Scholars Program.
MCSP was a wonderful community for me
to be a part of my freshman year. I lived on the
Hill in the cozy residence hall of Couzens close
to the Hill Dining Center, the Central Cam-
pus Recreational Building and Palmer Field.
Through MCSP I was able to take classes in
my residence hall, and most importantly, I was
able to focus on participating in many com-
munity service and social justice events with
people who were just as passionate as myself.
The students and faculty I met through MCSP
in those first few months made the transition
to college a piece of cake. The opportunities I
had were plentiful, and the community bond-
ing I experienced with other first-years in
MCSP led me to have a better freshman year
thanIever thought was possible. I loved being
a Wolverine.
I returned to MCSP this year, along with
about 30 other students, to be a student
leader in the program. As most of us know,
Couzens has been shut down this year due
to renovations. While we were quite heart-
broken last year when we heard the news
of being temporarily relocated to East Quad
Residence Hall, we knew Couzens was going
to be in excellent shape and designed to
benefit our learning community. Having to
cohabitate with the Residential College was
not something I was particularly fond of, but
since East Quad was much closer to Star-
bucks and the libraries on Central Campus, I

didn't complain too much. After all, MCSP's
home is Couzens, and will return there in the
summer of 2011. Or, so we thought.
Last Tuesday, several e-mails were
exchanged between faculty, student lead-
ers and first-year students in MCSP about
a new housing situation for next year. LSA
Dean Terrence McDonald has made the deci-
sion to not only keep MCSP in East Quad for
next year, but also to have us start collaborat-
ing with the RC and in the near future, open
a Center for Civic Engagement (the name is
still being decided upon). Did MCSP staff or
students have any say in this decision? No.
Did MCSP student leaders for the 2011-2012
academic year already sign their housing con-
tracts to room in Couzens for next year? Yes.
Was Couzens just renovated and students
asked for input on how to make the residence
hall better for all students of MCSP and its
faculty? Yes. Have we had many staff mem-
bers involved in meetings and planning time
for our move back to Couzens in the upcom-
ing summer? Yes. While I cannot speak for
the RC, I can guarantee that several RC mem-
bers have not enjoyed having to share their
space with MCSP, and I don't blame them.
One year in East Quad was enough for MCSP.
We should not be forced to stay somewhere
where we don't belong.
The dishonesty that has occurred between
the dean of LSA, Housing offices and MCSP
has made me reconsider what I think of such
a prestigious university. Although I already
planned on not living with MCSP next year, I
feel for the program and its inability to return
home, along with assumptions of expand-
ing the program and maybe altering some of
the core values, such as classes just for MCSP
students or community service events being
opened to other students.
Today, it's not great to be a Michigan
Wolverine.
Bethany Nagle is an LSA sophomore.

arly Friday morning, it was
announced that LSA juniors
DeAndree Watson and Bren-
dan Campbell
had won the elec-
tion to become
the next presi-
dent and vice
president of the
Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly.
Good for them.
A confession: I RACHEL
didn't vote in the VAN GILDER
election.
That's because
I've lost all hope in MSA. Scandal
after scandal - in only four years -
has turned me into a skeptic.
For those of you who weren't on
campus yet, here's an MSA history
lesson. In late 2007, then-MSA Pres-
ident Zach Yost sparked a scandal
when he mocked a fellow MSA mem-
ber,whosuffersfromAsperger'ssyn-
drome, via Facebook. He resigned in
disgrace. This was after a member of
his party had been accused of tam-
pering with the election that placed
him in office. That individual, then
LSA freshman Tony Vuljaj, was later
convicted of that crime - which was
a felony - but somehow managed to
retain his place on MSA.
Campus had a nice respite under
Mohammad Dar, who took over for
Yost in 2007, but then Sabrina Shin-
gwani and Arvind Sohoni of the
Michigan Action Party were elected
president and vice president in 2008.
They were responsible for the infa-
mous debate on the Israeli-Palestin-
ian conflict, which dominated two
long MSA meetings and resulted in a
resolution to watch a movie.
Then came my personal favor-
ite. During the winter 2010 semes-
ter, then-MSA President Abhishek
Mahanti announced that he spent

$9,000 of students' money fixingthe
MSA website, which never actually
got up and running. The MSA web-
site was replaced by one set up for
free by an Engineering freshman in
a matter of days.
And then there's been the parade
of political parties that have been
born and died in the last four years.
Tracking the evolution of parties
gives me a little bit of a headache, but
I'll try to lay it out for you.
Watson and Campbell are mem-
bers of MForward, the party that
looks like it will settle in to be the
most powerful on campus for a
while. Back in the day, the Michi-
gan Action Party swept elections.
Then it disbanded and reformed as
two separate parties - the Michigan
Vision Party and the reMICHIGAN
Campaign. After MVP shut down
reMICHIGAN in the 2009 MSA
presidential election, reMICHIGAN
disappeared.
Then Mforward was born. I've
been a little more optimistic about
MForward, especially following MSA
President Chris Armstrong's cool
demeanor in the face of harassment
and his ability to make it out of his
term without causing his ownscandal.
But even though Armstrong man-
aged not to mess anything up and
Watson and Campbell haven't done
anything to make me doubt them, I
still have a sinking feeling that more
disaster is headed our way, courtesy
of MSA officials.
MSA gets itself into trouble when
it gets wrapped up in things that
don't matter or it gets a little too big
for its britches. The basic function of
MSA - and one it'sfairly good at - is
to allocate money to student groups.
Every student organization from the
Squirrel Club to the Men's Glee Club
can petition to MSA for money, and
it will give out about $150,000 to

student organizations this semester,
according to a Feb.16 Daily article.
I've lost all hope
in our student
government.
That's the function that MSA
should stay focused on. It's not real-
ly an activist organization, though
it can do some good by pushing for
campus changes like open housing
(a pet project of Armstrong's) and
advocating for students' interests
with the state. MSA fails when it
starts to think too much of itself.
It fails when its members start
to think they're, above reproach,
when they think they should focus
on international issues over which
they have no control, or when they
think that they shouldn't settle for
a free - albeit simple - function-
ing website. Instead, MSA should
devote itself to giving student orga-
nizations as much money as pos-
sible to encourage an active student
body with a diverse set of talents
and interests.
Maybe I shouldn't care. I'm grad-
uating in the spring. But when I
return to The Michigan Daily web-
site to check up on my alma mater
in the fall, I don't want the banner
headline to read "MSA president to
resign following scandal."
So I'd like to take this moment to
make a plea to Watson and Camp-
bell: Please don't mess this up.

Wiz Khalifa gets 'Rolling'
Philly rapper sticks to the usual themes,
but the pop pays off
By Emma Gase I Daily Music EditorI

Film passion
put to the test

Wiz Khalifa has made it. Call
it fitting, then, that the major-
ity of his third album has Wiz
waxing poet-
ic about this
very fortunate **
twist of fate in Wiz Khalifa
his life: He's
famous now, Rolling Papers
and don't you Atlantic
fucking forget
it. He really
couldn't have picked a better
city to be from during this par-
ticular football season, either
- there's no doubt "Black and
Yellow" probably tripled the
amount of exposure for himself,
and for his newest album, Roll-
ing Papers (Lil' Wayne's comical
"Green and Yellow" rebuttle also
probably didn't hurt). But "Black
and Yellow" was a smash, Super
Bowl connections aside, without
the convenient and marketable
homie-reppin'-the-hometown
associations. Like 2009's Deal or
No Deal, Rolling Papers wants to
be a hit - these songs are asking
for it, no shame. But the differ-
ence is this time - high quality
or not - they kinda are hits.
There's no question that
Wiz has an exceptional ear for
melody. A decent chunk of his
hooks are addictive and aching
to be played in the summer with
the car windows rolled down.
"Wake Up" has him musing on
his rise to the top: "I came up in a
big way / And I hardly ever sleep
/ Well it's like a dream." "Top
Floor" is equal parts sexy R&B
sizzler and lush synthesizer bal-
lad. Wiz's fanbase, the cutely
dubbed "Taylor Gang" (in honor
of Wiz's kicks of choice, Chuck
Taylors), will have nothing to
complain about. But soon after
the initial infatuation with4Roli,
ing Papers the enamored feel-

ings fade away, leaving listeners
with an OK album from a newly
famous rapper whose subject
matter rarely deviates from hip
hop's Big Three: weed, bitches
and money.
Oddly enough, Wiz hits the
mark the most when he sings
rather than raps (if you can call
talking over a beat and occa-
sionally guffawing "rapping").
Despite his shortage of clever
wordplay, Wiz has succeeded in
what Kid Cudi failed to do on
Man on the Moon II - crafted
the truly perfect stoner song.
"The Race" has the same breezy
sonics of his earlier minor hit,
"The Thrill," but where "The
Thrill" gets you on your feet,
"The Race" kicks back, lights a
bong and smokes you out. "The
Race" glides effortlessly with
a synergistic grace, aided by
a slow, buoyant beat and airy
strings, right to the chorus
where Wiz sings, triumphant:
"I'm in the race / And takin' the
winner's place / No foot on the
brakes / One of the best, homie
that's what they call me." But
life's not all champagne and tok-
ing up, as Wiz feels the growing
pains that come with success:
"It's lonely at the top / Got no
company/ So now I just stunt on
my own." Sounds rough.
It's true that the vast major-
ity of Rolling Papers reads like
a carefully executed formula
to crack the Top 40. But to be
honest, a lot of it is successful
by sheer virtue that Wiz has
got something for everyone. He
makes sure there's a number-
one hit ("Black and Yellow"), a
party jam ("No Sleep"), one for
the ladies ("Roll Up") and one for
the potheads ("The Race"). Can't
fault a guy for tryingetoplease,
right? Wrong. No ambition could

ever excuse the presence of "Fly
Solo." This acoustic, gratingly
sunny monstrosity cops the
likes of B.o.B. and Travie McCoy
so hard it could be considered
copyright infringement. "Fly
Solo" is as maddeningly catchy
as it is atrociously generic. What
is a jaunty acoustic guitar and
Dispatch-esque chorus doing on
a Wiz Khalifa record? Nothin'
good, that's what.
It's also no surprise that Wiz's
cheapo chart-grasping sound
comes hand-in-hand with Roll-
ing Papers being his first release
under Atlantic Records. This
really is - in every sense of the
term - his mainstream debut.
And after Atlantic's shameless
mangling of Lupe Fiasco'sLasers
last month, it all makes perfect
sense. Major labels mean a major
push for radio play. It also means
more dough for Wiz, more girls
and more room for him to rest on
-his perma-blazed 'laurels:- but
it doesn't exactly compel him

to push the envelope in style or
charisma.
Wiz Kahlifa wants to be great.
That's no mystery. And at first
glance, it seems that he has a
decent chance to be able to hang
with hip hop's bigwig up-and-
comers (Drake, Nicki Minaj, J.
Cole). The arrogance, the hedo-
nism, the hooks - they're all
there, and in abundance. But
unfortunately for Wiz, the whole
is not greater than the sum of
the parts. There is no "ah-ha"
moment, no "Holy-shit-this-
dude's-a-genius" realization,
just some top-shelf cheap thrills
courtesy of a skinny guy from
Pittsburgh. Wiz Khalifa perfects
the art of being pretty good, and
when it comes to smoking 'dro,
stealing chicks and partying in
hotel rooms, Wiz is your man.
Whether or not he can cross into
something more significant or
inventive is up to him. Or if the
Steelers go tethe Super Bowl in
2012.

MENTAL HEALTH
From Page 1
Seeking Behavior Among College
Students," Eisenberg and Hunt
report that many who believe in
the trend - including research-
ers, clinicians and policymak-
ers - frequently cite two major
national surveys that, on the
surface, provide convincing evi-
dence.
The first is a 2008 survey by
the International Association
of Counseling Services, which
was conducted the study of 284
directors of college psychologi-
cal counseling offices in various
states. According to the study,
95 percent of directors said they
have seen a significant increase
in the number of serious psycho-
logical problems on their cam-
puses.
The second study, conducted
by the National College Health
Association, made an overall
assessment of mental health on
college campuses. Also from
2008, this study reports that the
number of students surveyed
who said they had been diag-
nosed with depression at some
point in their lives increased
from 10 percent in 2000 to15 per-
cent in 2008.
Eisenberg said the problem
with these statistics is that they
don't take into account the grad-

ual decline in the stigma against
mental health.
"In general, I don't necessarily
buy into the idea that the mental
health problems are dramati-
cally different than they used to
be," Eisenberg said. "I think that
the willingness of students to
express them and to seek help - I
think that clearly has changed."
But Todd Sevig, director of
Counseling and Psychological
Services at the University, said
he believes there is an increas-
ing trend in mental illness among
college students.
"I feel in my heart of hearts
as a clinician, anecdotally, that
there is an increase," Sevig said.
In an effort to increase aware-
ness of depression in the commu-
nity, the University's Depression
Center is hosting the Depression
on College Campuses Confer-
ence this week, aimed to deter-
mine new ways to combat the
perceived increase of depression
on campuses, according to the
Depression Center's website.
CAPS Associate Director Tim
Davis said he finds it hard to
believe that mental health prob-
lems aren't on the rise among
college students, because he
feels the life of a student is more
stressful than it was in the past.
Davis attributed this to demands
not only from classes but also
extracurricular activities and
stress from summer internships.

Stanley Watson, co-director of
the University's Molecular and
Behavioral Neuroscience Insti-
tute, echoed Davis's observation.
"I think the pressure that I
felt going to college and kind of
getting organized - it's a lot of
stress, but I don't think anybody
in my class came away nearly as
disrupted as the kids in my son's
class or my daughter's," Watson
said.
CAPS Associate Director Vic-
toria Hays, said she thinks the
economy is another major stress
on students today. She compared
the stress to the months after the
Sept. 11 attacks when she said
there was a notable increase in
students using CAPS because of
"changes in the sense of safety in
the world."
The 1992 National Comorbid-
ity Survey found 25 percent of
people diagnosed with mental
disorders had received treatment
the previous year, which was
an increase from the 19 percent
reported seven years earlier. The
same survey in 2002 found that
the number of people who sought
treatment had jumped to 41 per-
cent.
Sevig said it Was rare for older
people to seek mental health ser-
vices because "it just wasn't part
of that generation's lifestyle."
Now, research shows that stigma
of mental health is decreasing
among college students, encour-

aging more of them to seek help,
he added.
"This is the first generation ...
of college students that received
services as children and adoles-
cents in large numbers," Sevig
said. "It's the first generation
of students where their parents
have received services."
The CAPS 2009-2010 annual
report revealed that during the
2008-2009 and 2009-2010 aca-
demic years, 3,127 and 3,362
students, respectively, used
CAPS clinical services. The
addition of more staff members
and increased funding is partly
responsible for the rise, Sevig
said.
LSA senior Caitlin Pollock said
there seems to be more aware-
ness about mental health issues
compared to when her parents
were in college.
"They'll say they probably had
friends or knew people that were
depressed, but they would never
know what it was," Pollack said.
LSA sophomore Vishesha Patel
said she thinks this generation
of college students is under a lot
of pressure to be successful and
"become something." She said
she thinks it's harder now than it
was for her parents, who only had
a few options for what to do with
their lives.
"Now we have so many choic-
es, and it's hard to decide (what
career to pursue)," Patel said.

"It's stressful. It's a pretty big
campus, you have to compete a
lot to be the best."
One study published in 2009 in
Clinical Psychology Review tried
to pinpoint the root cause of the
trend of mental health problems
among college students while
accounting for reduced stigma.
To compare the levels of
mental illness between genera-
tions, the study looked at scores
from the Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory - which
measures levels of psychological
ailments like depression para-
noia, schizophrenia, hypomania
and hysteria - from the 1930s to
2007.
The controls they used to
account for reduced stigma mea-
sured respondents' tendency
toward "socially desirable and
defensive responding." Even with
these controls, the researchers
found that mental illness did rise
from one generation to the next.
The researchers concluded
that the trend did not correlate
with economic cycles, ruling the
economy out as a possible cause.
They ultimately concluded that
the mostlikelysource ofthetrend
was a cultural shift in priorities
from intrinsic goals - such as
getting involved in community
groups, making close friends and
developing a "meaningful phi-
losophy of life" - to extrinsic
goals characterized by "materi-

alism, individualism, unrealistic
expectations and unstable rela-
tionships." These extrinsic goals,
the researchers argue, contribute
to more cases of mental distress.
While the study took into
account reduced stigma, the
researchers acknowledged that
it didn't deal with the possibility
that psychopathologic symptoms
are becoming socially accept-
able. The study also recognized
that it didn't account for the fact
that more students with ailments
like depression and anxiety now
attend college due to more pre-
scription use.
Rachel Glick, the associate
chair for clinical and adminis-
trative affairs in the University's
Department of Psychiatry, said
before the advent of Prozac in the
1980s, anti-depressants had more
serious side effects and required
careful dosing, so doctors had
to monitor their patients more
closely. Now, family practitio-
ners and other specialty doctors
feel comfortable prescribing the
drugs because they're simple,
once-a-day medications, she said.
Glick added that an increased
use of anti-depressants and
other drugs means more people
with debilitating mental health
issues, who wouldn't be able to
attend college otherwise, now go
on to pursue higher education if
they're on medications that help
them function.

FROST
From Page 1
According to the School of
Information website, Frost's
professional interests were
in industrial rationalization,
industrial informatics and gen-
der and information technology,
among other areas.
Frost was the great-grandson
of the famous poet Robert Frost.
Frost and his wife Margaret
Hedstrom, associate dean for
academic programs and a pro-
fessor in the School of Informa-
tion, established the Frost Open
Access Fund - a program that
enables open access projects to
use the royalties from Frost's
great-grandfather's work.
Frost was also an active
member of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs - on which he helped
make key decisions that affect
University faculty - for more
than two years. SACUA mem-
bers spoke in memory of Frost
at their weekly meeting yester-
day afternoon.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman
said Frost was always enthusi-
astic about his work with the
organization, particularly in
his involvement with the Native
American Graves Protection
and Repatriation Act, a federal
law which mandates how muse-
ums handle and record artifacts
from Native American tribes.
"Bob's great strength and car-
ing attitude in the face of his ill-
ness were an inspiration to us

all," Rothman said.
SACUA member Kate Barald,
a professor in the University's
Medical School and College of
Engineering, fondly remem-
bered sitting with Frost at meet-
ings where she said he "always
hit the nail on the head" with
his great sense of humor and
reasoning skills.
SACUA member Stephen Lus-
mann, an associate professor of
music, said Frost fought cancer
without self-pity and that he
will miss him as a colleague and
fellow jazz enthusiast.
A Bethesda, Md. native, Frost
was born on Oct. 25, 1952. He
completed his undergradu-
ate degree at Grinnell College,
where he met his wife. Frost and
Hedstrom were married in 1976.
Prior to coming to the Uni-
versity, Frost was an associate
professor at State University of
New York at Albany. Through-
out his career, he held various
positions at higher education
institutions including Carthage
College, Wabash College and
American University.
Frost received graduate
degrees from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and had
several visiting assistant pro-
fessorships before coming to
the University of Michigan in
1995, when he was an associate
visiting professor of history. He
began teaching in the School
of Information in 2000 and
became an associate professor
in 2003.
Frost was diagnosed with
cancer more than two years ago.

However, he still taught classes
in the School of Information
during the time.
Students and colleagues cre-
ated a Relay for Life group
called Team Frost to fundraise
for cancer research in honor
of him. Rackham student KT
Lowe, who is on the Relay for
Life team, took two courses
with Frost and considered him
a friend as well as a committed
professor.
"Bob was brilliant and wasn't
afraid to be brilliant," Lowe
wrote in an e-mail interview.
Lowe said the Relay team
has raised $6,000 so far, but the
team members' goal is to reach
$10,000 before the event on
April 9.
Jay Jackson, editor senior
in the School of Information's
Office of Development and
External Relations, wrote about
Frost's passing on the school's
blog, the SI Informant. Jackson
wrote about Frost's legacy and
provided a link in the blog to
donate to the American Cancer
Society.
"Those who knew (Frost)
will always remember him for
his forthright manner, his deep
concern for the welfare of oth-
ers, and his unwavering com-
mitment to teaching," Jackson
wrote in the blog.
Frost is survived by his wife,

ate dean for academic affairs at

"The Michigan Theater is

it's actually two separate build-
ings," Tillotson-Becker said.
"The front is on the Liberty
power grid, but the front didn't
go down. The Washington grid
did go down. The screening
room is on that side ... so we
cancelled the 7:15 and the 9:30
screening tonight."
Tillotson-Becker said "DTE
was terrible" and that she was
frustrated by conflicting reports
she had received from DTE
Energy, which claimed on the
company's automated record-
ing that the power would be
restored by 9 pm., but by 10:45

absence of caffeine.
"It won't be the same with-
out the caffeine," Barron said,
"I think people will still buy it,
but because it's not the same, it
won't have as much hype."
While the new version of Four
Loko is readily available around
campus, several University stu-
dents stocked up on the old ver-
sion before it became illegal to
sell.
A University student - who
requested anonymity - said
he's one of many students who
purchased large amounts of the
old version as soon as he heard it

was being removed from stores.
He said that since the ban, he
has sold the old version under-
ground, and that his sales have
taken off.
"When the supply goes down,
the demand goes up," he said.

a non-caffeinated version of the
drink that was legally allowed to
be sold.
Gary Breher, manager of
Main Street Party Store on
North Main Street, said he was
surprised to discover that the
new Four Loko is quite popular.
"I'm stunned at how well it's
selling," Breher said.
Breher said the old version of
Four Loko had great sales in his
store, especially right before the
ban took effect.
"The old Four Loko used to fly
off the shelves," he said.
Jerome Kamano, manager of
the Diag Party Shoppe on North
State Street, agreed that the old
version of Four Loko sold very

well - especially after the ban
was announced in November.
Kamano also said his store
"couldn't keep it on the shelves"
at the time.
The new version of Four Loko
- which Diag Party Shoppe
began selling about two weeks
ago - is also selling well, Kama-
no said.
Kamano added that custom-
ers have expressed excitement
about seeing it back on shelves
and are curious if the product
still contains caffeine.
Maher Jaboro, co-owner of
A & L Wine Castle on West Sta-

store has not begun selling the
new version yet.
"We're planning to sell (it),

At times, Michigan senior Lion
Kim has had trouble concentrating
on college golf during the Michi-
gan men's golf team's spring sea-
son.
"I didn't have a hard time in
the fall," Kim said. "I was just all
focused about helping this team
win golf tournaments and doing
well. But in all honesty, yeah it's
been kind of hard (focusing in the
spring)."
Kim, Michigan's captain, won
the U.S. Amateur Public Links
Championship in July to qualify
for this year's Masters.
In just over a week, the Lake
Mary, Fla. native will be walking
down the immaculate fairways of
Augusta National Golf Club, com-
peting against the best golfers in
the world. Can you blame him for
lacking a little concentration?
He's had a lot of time to think
aboutwhatit'sgoingtobelikecom-
peting with and against players
like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickel-
son, playing on Amen Corner - the
famous three-hole stretch of holes
11-13 - and experiencing what
every golfer dreams about.
"Once the spring season rolled
around, in my mind, I really used
the four tournaments that we
played as a preparation for the
Masters," Kim said. "But with
that said, I was still giving mybest
because at the end of the day I've
got to help my scores and help my
team out."
But Kim has practiced away
from the college game, too. He's
traveled to Augusta three times
since November, and he will be
there the weekend before the tour-
nament to get in some extra prac-
tice.
Though he'll be playing on a

JAKE fROMM/Daily
Sophomore pointguard Darius Morris has until April24 to decide whether he
wants to enter his name in the NBA draft.

- it's to have a long career in the
NBA.
Many players have left early
thinking that they're ready for
the pros - some even as high
draft picks - only to flame out
because they weren't truly pre-
pared for the rigors of the NBA.
It's a situation the Wolverines
encountered just last year when
Beilein initiated a similar process
with two players - guard Manny
Harris and forward DeShawn
Sims. Harris decided to leave one
year early after the 2009-10 sea-
son. But Harris wasn't drafted,
leaving his professional basket-
ball career in a perilous spot.
Luckily for Harris, he made it
throughcamp with the Cleveland
Cavaliers and has earned plenty
of playing time in his rookie year.
But the uncertainty he faced

is what Michigan is trying to
avoid with Morris and any future
potential early entrants.
Another issue involved in
Morris's decision is a potential
NBA lockout for next season, as
the collective bargaining agree-
ment between the league and
Players' Association expires this
summer.
For now, Morris is in a holding
pattern until he receives word
back from the advisory commit-
tee - an evaluation Beilein said
will stay confidential.
"I can't predict (if Morris
will leave)," Beilein said. "We're
gathering information. I don't go
there and study all of who's com-
ing out and who isn't coming out,
and I think that until that time, a
lot will be determined on that.
"So I can't predict that."

difficult courses in the world - the
focus of his practice rounds has
been the same as ifhe were playing
in any other tournament.
"Short game," Kim said. "That's
where you score, around the
greens. You gottahave agreat feel-
ing with your shortgame, and most
importantly you have to have a
good feel for the greens, the slopes
and everything."
And of course, Kim spent some
time checking out the course as a
whole, too.
"(The course) was everything
I imagined it being," he said. "It's
absolutely stunning. It's exactly
how youwould see it on TV."
For Michigan coach Andrew
Sapp, watching one of his players
play in the Masters will truly be a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.
Sapp, a North Carolina native,
had chancesto goto the Masters as
a fan when he was younger, but he
declined the opportunity.
"I had some relatives that actu-
ally had tickets, but I wanted to
have a good reason to go," he said.
And now he's found his reason.
Sapp will be going heading to
Augusta on Monday, the day after
coaching his team at the LSU
Intercollegiate, to support Kim.
"It's almost as good as going
down to play yourself," Sapp said.
"I'm definitely looking forward to
being able to experience it with
him and seeing it more than just *
from a fan's point of view, but also
the players' point of view."
And for Kim, anything could
happen on the No. 1-ranked golf
course in the world.
"If I do well, it could open up
some doors in the future," Kim *
said. "But at the end of the day,
whatever happens, happens. I'm
just really looking forward to com-
peting in the Masters. And also,
most importantly, to have fun and
enjoy it."
