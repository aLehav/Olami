When 
Elizabeth 
James, 

program 
associate 
for 
the 

Department 
of 
Afroamerican 

and African Studies, attended 
the University of Michigan for 
her undergraduate degree in the 
1970s, she experienced an act of 
racism that seemed unthinkable 
to her: Someone vandalized her 
dorm room door with a racial slur.

“We had someone scrawl on 

our door when we first moved into 
our dormitory, and at that time 
it was just unbelievable,” James 
said. “We were really hurt.”

When nearly the same thing 

happened in West Quad Residence 
Hall this semester, James felt as if 
she were transported back to the 
’70s. 

“Some of the things just trigger 

me, in that they are very similar,” 
she said.

Since the semester started, 

more than 20 acts of explicit 
racism or bigotry have occurred 
on or near campus. Aside from 
the racist graffiti scrawled on 
a West Quad dorm room, racist 
posters have been found in 
several campus locations, a man 
defiled a “Black Lives Matter” 
chalk drawing on the Diag and 
anti-Latino 
sentiments 
were 

painted on the Rock.

James, who is also the faculty 

adviser for the University’s Black 
Student 
Union 
and 
National 

Council 
of 
Negro 
Women, 

said she was able to cope with 
racism while in school by finding 
comfort and support in her peers 
and friends. But James posited: 
How are today’s events affecting 
the mental health of targeted 
students? 

“A lot of students are tired,” 

James said. “A lot of students 
want results.”

When racism hits, it can 

negatively 
affect 
the 
mental 

health of students of color. 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services 
psychologist 
Sheryl 

Kelly said there are two typical 

reactions to experiencing racism, 
and both take a toll on a student’s 
health.

“It 
varies, 
depending 
on 

individuals,” Kelly said. “You 
have some people that have dealt 
with it for so long that they’re 
kind of saying, ‘Unfortunately, 
I’ve seen this before and some 
students that feel hopeless and 
helpless to finding a remedy 
to this situation. And I believe 
that latter one seems to be very 
prevalent on this campus. I think 
a lot of students are tired. A lot of 
students want results.”

Ebony McGee, a professor of 

diversity and urban schooling 
at Vanderbilt University, told 
Vanderbilt’s research blog her 

research proves these harmful 
effects are pervasive.

“Weathering the cumulative 

effects of living in a society 
characterized 
by 
white 

dominance and privilege produces 
a kind of physical and mental 
wear-and-tear that contributes 
to a host of psychological and 
physical 
ailments,” 
McGee 

said. 
“We 
have 
documented 

alarming occurrences of anxiety, 
stress, depression and thoughts 
of suicide, as well as a host of 
physical ailments like hair loss, 
diabetes and heart disease.”

Research on this topic has 

also been done at the University. 
A study from David Williams, 
a 
professor 
of 
sociology 

and 
epidemiology, 
further 

explains the link by analyzing 
several reports that discussed 
the 
connection 
between 

discrimination and mental health 
of LGBTQ individuals, Latinos, 
immigrant populations and Black 
people. All reports showed an 
increase in discrimination led to 
a decrease in mental health.

“(P)erceptions 
of 
racial 

discrimination were related to 
higher levels of psychological 
distress and lower levels of life 
satisfaction and happiness as 
well as with poorer physical 
health,” Williams’s report reads. 
“Everyday discrimination was 
significantly 
related 
to 
both 

measures 
of 
mental 
health 

status, independent of traditional 
measures of life events, chronic 
stress, and financial stress.”

“It’s very easy to think in 

this sort of cloud of nothing 
matters” 

Minority 
students 
at 
the 

University understand this data 
firsthand. Some say they live it 
every day on campus.

LSA senior Akanksha Sahay is 

the president of Yoni Ki Baat, an 
organization of women of color 
on campus. In the weeks after 
last fall’s presidential election, 
she was afraid to walk around 
campus in her own skin.

“Muslim women were being 

attacked or assaulted,” Sahay 
said. “I don’t identify as Muslim, 
but because I have such visibly 
brown skin, I’ve been mistaken as 
Muslim in the past … being visibly 
brown felt like an invitation for 
some kind of violence.” 

Although 
the 
majority 
of 

hate crimes on campus this 
semester 
have 
targeted 
the 

Black community, which Sahay 
also does not identify with, she 
said it’s impossible to stand 
by as a minority when other 
groups are being attacked. As 
a campus activist, she has been 
involved in the protests of the 
past month. She also struggles 
with depression, which she said 
makes dealing with these events 
so much more difficult.

“Obviously, there are some 

days where you just can’t get out 
of bed and that’s a part of being 
depressed, but when there are 
events like this on campus, it just 
seems like even more of a reason 
to not bother trying,” Sahay said. 
“It’s very easy to think in this sort 
of cloud of nothing matters and 
it’s easier to not feel anything 
than to feel upset all the time 
... (the campus climate) effects 
whether or not a day can go from 
‘I can deal with these things 
because I know there are people 
on campus who have my back’ to 
‘I need to stay at home because 
I can’t deal with anything right 
now.’” 

LSA junior Timberlee Whiteus 

has also been active in the 
protests on campus. She said in 
an email interview, as a Black 
woman, the events of the past 
month have been disturbing 
but not surprising. After all, 
she’d experienced racism at the 
University before, in a chemistry 
classroom.

“I was once in a Chem lab and 

I had a partner who requested to 
change partners and would not 
work with me,” Whiteus wrote. 
“She went out of her way each lab 
to work with another group, in 
which I was forced to work alone 

The 
Women’s 
Studies 

Department at the University 
of Michigan was founded in 
1973 with the aim of combining 
elements of medicine, health 
and law, as well as disciplines 
from the humanities and social 
sciences. It offers two majors, 
three 
minors 
and 
several 

graduate opportunities.

Though the department has 

expanded, in terms of size and 
course content, students and 
faculty agree people who are 
not in the field may have certain 
misconceptions about its nature 
— specifically that is anti-men 
and not lucrative in the future. 
In reality, the department’s 
mission is to provide a holistic 
education, 
discussing 
the 

intersection of gender with a 
range of other fields from arts 
education to neurology.

Interdisciplinary education is 

central to the department, along 
with an emphasis on feminist 
theory.

Rosario Ceballo, the Women’s 

Studies 
Department 
chair, 

believes the interdisciplinary 
aspects 
of 
the 
department 

is 
“incredibly 
intellectually 

exciting,” but also very relevant 
and important to the world 
today. She said employers look 
for new employees who are able 
to think broadly across fields.

“If you look at the social 

problems in our world today, we 
cannot attempt to solve them 

with one approach, or from one 
particular set of expertise or 
knowledge base,” she said. “To 
really be able to have an impact 
in society you need to be able to 
come at social problems from 
different perspectives and have 
different things in your toolkit.”

This is a view also held by 

Victor Mendoza, an associate 
professor 
and 
the 
director 

of 
undergraduate 
studies 

in 
women’s 
studies, 
who 

highlighted the curriculum’s 
emphasis on interdisciplinary 
and 
cross-cultural 

understanding 
in 
an 
email 

interview.

“And 
by 
interdisciplinary, 

I mean something of a radical 
interdisciplinary, in that our 
faculty 
include 
historians, 

literary 
studies 
scholars, 

legal scholars, psychologists, 
nurses, 
political 
scientists, 

midwives, poets, digital studies 

scholars, performance artists, 
anthropologists and physicians,” 
he wrote. “The various fields 
of inquiry represented by such 
a disciplinarily varied faculty 
— not to mention the various 
geographical sites they work on 
across the globe — speak to the 
richness of feminist scholarship 
that the curriculum offers.”

Majors, minors and course 

themes

In partnership with the Ross 

School of Business, University 
of Michigan students in the 
College of Pharmacy can now 
receive a dual doctorate of 
Pharmacy and an MBA degree 
in five years. Courses for the 
new 
dual 
degree 
program 

begin in the spring/summer 
2018 semester, but students 
can apply for the program now.

According to the College of 

Pharmacy, 54.4 percent of the 
2017 graduating class is on a 
residency program career path. 
For many students, a future in 
clinical work lies ahead, but 
some seek a broader education 
spectrum to bring the world 
of drugs into modern business 
fields.

The new dual doctorate of 

Pharmacy and MBA consists 
of completing three years of a 
normal pharmacy education. 
As part of the new program, 
instead of continuing on the 
typical pharmacy path of one 
more year of rotations before 
graduation, 
the 
new 
dual 

degree supplements this fourth

In order to better serve 

the needs of first-generation 
students 
on 
campus, 
the 

University of Michigan has 
opened the First-Generation 
Student Gateway — a study 
lounge, 
meeting 
area 
and 

information hub concentrated 
into one cohesive space.

The University defines first-

generation students as those 
who self-identify as not having 
prior knowledge of or exposure 
to 
how 
to 
succeed 
while 

attending institutes of higher 
learning. These students may 
need additional educational 
input to get to the same level 
of background knowledge as 
their peers.

Located 
in 
the 
Student 

Activities Building, the space 
serves as an access point 
for 
several 
other 
student 

offices including the Office 
of New Student Programs, 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 
and the Office of Academic 
Multicultural Initiatives.

The space also houses the 

office

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

Panel discusses implications of the 
expiration of DACA for students

DACA will not officially end until March 2018, though many see consequences now

The Hispanic Business Students 

Association hosted an open panel 
regarding the dissolution of the 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals 
and 
its 
impacts 
on 

University of Michigan students 
and staff Thursday at the Ross 
School of Business’s Blau Hall. 
About 55 students, prospective 
students and faculty members 
attended the event.

President 
Donald 
Trump 

announced the end of the program, 
which protected undocumented 
child immigrants from deportation 
as long as they maintained certain 
requirements and lacked significant 
criminal history, in early September. 
However, DACA will only officially 
dissolve on March 5, 2018. 

Business Dean Scott DeRue 

gave the opening remarks, citing 
the conversation’s importance and 

the school’s lawful responsibility to 
support students.

“There are two guiding principles 

to every decision that we make 
as a University and as a business 
school,” DeRue said. “First, we have 
to be lawful. Second, everything 
that we do with the law is going 
to be student-centric and student-
focused. We will do everything in 
our lawful power to support you.”

Panelist 
Jesse 
Hoffnung-

Garskof, associate professor of 
History and American Culture, 
then moved to debriefing the history 
of DACA and the societal gaps in 
American immigration policy. He 
also noted that illegal immigration 
peaked in 2007 and that since then, 
immigrant migration has been a net 
negative.

“From my perspective, because 

immigration 
reform 
over 
the 

last 30 years has focused almost 
exclusively on enforcement and 
criminalization, 
the 
population 

that is now undocumented faces 

a wider gap (or as wide a gap as 
has ever existed in this country) 
between 
people 
of 
different 

statuses,” Hoffnung-Garskof said. 
“You can think of immigration 
law as the law of determining who 
and how people get in, or you can 
think of immigration law as the 
law of determining how people of 
different statuses have different 
access to rights and benefits.”

The panel then moved to a 

discussion of legal parameters 
by 
Rebeca 
Ontiveros-Chavez, 

attorney 
and 
Department 
of 

Justice-accredited representative 
for the Michigan Immigrant Rights 
Center, who said she herself is a 
former DACA recipient. Ontiveros-
Chavez explained how the removal 
of DACA will affect recipients’ 
higher education, driving, travel, 
finances and other means.

“In terms of driving after the 

DACA resignation, if you have 
a Michigan driver’s license, a 
Michigan driver’s license is only 
valid in the same period as you 
have proof of legal status,” she said. 
“Once your proof of legal status 
expires, the license is no longer 
valid, unless you obtain another 
form of legal presence under 
Michigan law.”

LSA junior Daniel Lopez said 

he works with undocumented 
students on campus and plans to 
use what he learned at the panel to 
assist the groups he works with.

“I 
am 
an 
advocate 
for 

immigration reform, so what we do 
is gather all of the information we 
can and then get this information 
to our community to have them 
call their elected representatives,” 
Lopez said. “We should have a 
clean DREAM Act.”

For those who are facing 

anxiety over the termination of 
DACA, Business graduate student 
Elizabeth Padilla, vice president 
of the HSBA, gave advice on 
attempting to live a normal life 
while encountering immigration 
challenges.

2 — Friday, October 13, 2017
News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Every Friday, The Michigan Daily 
will be republishing an article from 
the Daily’s archives from a moment in 
University history. 

December 9, 1983 
— When 

the pressure of final exams gets 
too intense for LSA junior Shelly 
McNamara, she punches out her 
stuffed animals.

LSA sophomore David Pascal and 

his roommates drove his car through 
the East Engineering arch Wednesday 
night just to release some study 
tension.

Residence hall staffs attributed a 

monstrous snowball fight between 
nearly 150 students from Markley, 
Couzens, and Mosher Jordan 
dormitories Tuesday night to pre-
finals anxiety.

And even the most restrained 

students might let loose a primal 
scream to make it through late nights 
of cramming a neglected semester’s 
worth of reading into only a few hours.

While today marked the last day 

of classes, it also signifies the start of 
the most intense days of the semester. 
Study days — the University’s gift of 

time to students before the final exam 
anvil falls on their fact-filled heads 
— put students in their own world of 
study anxiety.

It is a time when students live on 

caffeine and candy bars, when they 
disappear into campus libraries to 
master academic feats such as learning 
a semester of organic chemistry in 48 
hours.

“You push yourself to the limit 

(during study days),” said Jennifer 
Clark, an Alice Lloyd resident adviser. 
“You push yourself farther than you 
thought you could.” 

The darker side of people’s 

personalities emerge during finals 
week. Tempers grow short. Vision 
narrows to immediate study goals as 
each student struggles with his or her 
own feelings of panic.

Students walking the tightrope 

of pressure during study days find 
different ways to release tension — 
some more unusual than others. 

LSA sophomore Melissa McDaniel 

plays with eight wind-up Smurf dolls 
and tries to get the toys all walking at 
the same time.

Some of her friends pull out crayons 

and coloring books to cope with final 
exam pressures.

By tackling such simple tasks, 

students can build their confidence, 
she said.

Winding up dolls “is not too tough, 

and it’s something I know I can do,” 
said McDaniel. 

Sometimes it’s worth doing these 

things just for a laugh, she added. 

“You don’t get to laugh much 

during finals week. Unless you stay up 
late and get giddy,” she said.

McNamara, the South Quad RA 

who abuses stuffed animals, said she 
picked up odd strategies for coping 
with finals pressure from a former 
resident director who told her to 
throw plastic glasses against the wall.

Pascal, the bold LSA sophomore 

who ran his car through the 
Engineering arch said students 
become crazier during exams to 
combat the tense atmosphere on 
campus.

“You do fun things you wouldn’t do 

under normal situations to counteract 
the effects of sitting in the library,” 
he said.

Lisa Koppelberger, who was doing 

last-minute work on a paper at the 
Graduate Library last night, said the 
competitive nature of the University is 
partly to blame for the pressure during 
finals week. Although the LSA junior 
said she isn’t too concerned with 
grades, there is still the feeling that 
“you hope everyone else is having as 
much trouble as you are.”

“EVERY conversation you hear is 

about finals,” she said.

Becoming too preoccupied with 

studying however, can be hazardous 
to your health, according to University 
Senior Counselor Tom Morson. 
Students can become so overwhelmed 
by their study anxiety they begin to 
link their academic performance to 
their self esteem, he said.

Students can put so much emphasis 

on their grades that marks begin to 
define their self worth, Morson said. 
An “A” paper means the student is an 
“A” person, and depression balloons as 
the grade drops.

(which didn’t bother me) … I 
thought that the idea of someone 
not wanting to work with me was 
absurd, but I realized that there 
are many people I will encounter 
that will question my ability 
comprehend and function.”

“Students 
are 
not 
only 

concerned about potentially 
missing class … but it’s a safety 
issue”

While Whiteus did not let that 

event hurt her mental health 
— she said it actually made her 
stronger — the issue of students 
feeling unable to go to class 
because of depression or fears 
that their safety is at risk is a 
major worry of Esrold Nurse, 
assistant 
dean 
of 
academic 

affairs.

One 
of 
Nurse’s 
main 

responsibilities 
is 
to 
send 

emails to professors on behalf of 
students who need to miss class 
for whatever reason. Usually, he 
said, this is because of illness or 
the death of a family member. 
However, he also sends out 
emails on behalf of students who 
feel unable to go to class due to 
fears of racism or discrimination.

“We’ve always had situations, 

the way I see them, that affect 
students’ ability to perform, to 
do the things they came here to 
do, which is to get a degree and 
to be educated,” Nurse said. “My 
role as assistant dean is to ensure 
that students are able to do that 
without outside distractions or 
things that might happen. So 
this is in that vein. The recent 
incidences have clearly affected 
some of the students in a way 
that detracts from that mission of 
focusing on the work they have to 
do to get their degree.”

Nurse, a Black man, has been 

in his current position since 1995. 
The events of the last semester 
are not new to him, but they are 
still serious.

“This is really ratcheted up a 

level, because students are not 
only concerned about potentially 
missing class … but it’s a safety 
issue,” he said. “Whether this 
place is safe for me to walk 
around at night or during the day 
and so on. So to that extent, it’s 
really a big issue.”

The executive board of the 

Black Student Union, which did 
not respond to interview requests 
for this article, tweeted about 
Nurse’s service last week.

Nurse said he was glad the BSU 

publicized his service, though he 
did not ask them to do so. He just 
wants everyone to be able to feel 
safe and accepted on campus.

“I’ve sent quite a few (of these 

emails),” Nurse said. “I don’t have 
an exact number in mind, but … 
it’s not excessive. In that context, 
it’s part of the responsibility I 
feel I take personally … The least 
I can do is notify the instructor 
of the difficulties they’re having 
and I think that’s appropriate.”

“These organizations have 

opened their doors for dialogue 
and advice, and essentially 
have become a safe space.”

Coping with racism does not 

have a one-size-fits-all solution, 
though. While some students 
feel they need to stay home to 
focus on self-care, others like 
Whiteus are taking advantage of 
communities around campus.

“My outlet for dealing with 

these things is mainly connecting 
with my peers. … I talk with 
those who experience the same 
injustices I do and those who 
don’t so they will know the ways 
in which their privilege can be 
beneficial,” she wrote. “I am on 
the E-Board for NAACP and I 

attend BSU meetings. Both of 
these 
organizations 
and 
the 

people in them are wonderful 
and they work hard to make 
the community one that is not 
only inclusive but safe. These 
organizations have opened their 
doors for dialogue and advice, 
and essentially have become a 
safe space.”

James 
also 
hailed 
the 

importance of safe spaces, saying 
a support system is crucial when 
someone’s 
identity 
is 
under 

attack. 
She 
helped 
organize 

mental health discussions in 
DAAS and also with the BSU, 
though she said both events were 
mostly student-led.

“In both places we talked about 

what do you do to relieve tension 
and pressure,” James said. “The 
things ranged from calling your 
parents to just talk with them 
about some stories they can share 
to give some inspiration and hope 
to people saying, ‘I go to a Dojo 
and take out the frustration,’ to 
other people saying they journal. 
There’s just a wide variety of 
possibilities and that was helpful, 
I think.”

CAPS has been important 

in helping Black students work 
through the racism on campus, 
too. The BSU organized an 
event with CAPS last Thursday 
to help raise awareness of their 
resources and talk about coping 
strategies. According to Kelly, 
CAPS is working to make itself 
available to students beyond its 
normal counseling services.

“I have gone to be a presence 

at protests,” she said. “I’ve gone 
to town halls. I’ve done specified 
outreaches so students know 
we are here. … That seems to 
provide some sense of comfort to 
students.”

Although 
she 
didn’t 
have 

exact numbers, Kelly also said 
there has been an increase in the 

number of students using CAPS’s 
services.

Another way students are 

coping with the frustration of 
the last month is by protesting. 
Groups have protested the C.C. 
Little Science Building and bus 
station on two occasions and 
many minority students and 
allies joined Dana Greene when 
he knelt on the Diag for nearly 24 
hours.

A Black LSA sophomore who 

wished to remain anonymous 
because of her position as a 
diversity peer educator in U-M 
Housing said protests are how 
she channels her energy.

“It 
hasn’t 
gotten 
to 
the 

point where it’s been super 
jeopardizing in terms of being 
able to get up in the morning, but 
it definitely takes a toll on one 
mentally,” she said. “Protesting 
has been a way to relieve some 
of those emotions that I’ve been 
feeling. To just sort of express 
myself … It really helps to make 
a bolder statement that these 
issues are happening.”

Ultimately, every student has 

a different way of coping with 
the emotional toll of the issues. 
But the sophomore emphasized 
the most important thing is for 
any marginalized students is 
to remember why they’re at the 
University in the first place.

“After a while, I think we 

all sort of strive to look beyond 
what’s going on and think about 
our ultimate goal, which is to 
graduate,” she said. “All these 
little, little obstacles and stupid 
comments and incidents that 
are happening on campus are 
hurdles but we have to keep 
pushing forward and not let it get 
to us, in a way … ultimately, if you 
get so distracted by these events 
that you can’t study for a test and 
you fail, then they’ve done their 
job. So don’t let that happen.”

Project 
Manager 
Adan 

Hussain, who emphasized the 
importance of creating a space 
to welcome these students on 
campus in an interview with 
the University Record.

“What 
we’ve 
done 
is 

centralized 
a 
lot 
of 
first-

generation efforts,” Hussain, 
who was also a first-generation 
student, said. “It was really 
important to us to have a 
dedicated 
space 
because 
it 

creates a welcoming area and 
shows our commitment that 
we truly want these students 
here.” 

In an email interview with 

The Daily, LSA senior Hunter 
Zhao, 
president 
of 
First-

Generation College Students @ 
Michigan, said he felt like an 
imposter after first realizing 
many of his peers came from 
highly 
educated 
families. 

Unable 
to 
identify 
with 

their past travel or research 
experiences, 
Zhao 
said 
he 

initially struggled to come to 
terms with his own unique 
reality at the University.

“Beyond academics, I felt so 

out of place at the University 
of Michigan; it didn’t matter 
how many friends I could 
make on campus, I felt like 
a 
complete 
imposter,” 
he 

wrote. “These feelings were so 
pervasive during my first year 
at Michigan, but I had no idea 
how to make sense of my own 
experience. After a structured 

study group in my [organic 
chemistry] class, I told one 
of my classmates that I was 
the first in my family to go to 
college. ‘You’re so brave,’ she 
said. And somehow those words 
clicked in my mind. There had 
to be others; I began looking up 
other students at Michigan who 
were the first to go to college.”

However, after Zhao joined 

the First-Generation College 
Students organization, he said 
he finally found a community 
where he belonged, in which he 
learned the vocabulary to better 
understand, and even challenge, 
his 
experience 
on 
campus. 

He noted the University has 
been incredibly generous in 
supporting 
first-generation 

students and connecting them 
with a multitude of career 
opportunities.

“One 
of 
the 
biggest 

challenges that first-gens face is 
recognizing their own identity 
as a source of empowerment; 
our organization has received 
countless 
requests 
from 

industries 
like 
Google, 

Goldman Sachs and even the 
Detroit Pistons, who all have 
been interested in working 
with first-generation college 
students,” he wrote.

LSA junior Jazmine Mercado, 

executive board member of 
First-Generation 
College 

Students, 
said 
she 
believes 

the 
new 
First-Generation 

Gateway will serve as a space 
for students to come together 
and feel comfortable discussing 
their shared experiences.

“I think the First-Generation 

Gateway is long overdue and 

first-generation students need 
a place they can feel safe and 
content working in,” she said. 
“I think the Gateway will 
provide this to them and help 
them grow overall. Hopefully 
this Gateway will create a space 
where, in the future, first-
generation students can feel 
they can go and have a place 
to study, talk with faculty or 
simply hang out.”

Zhao 
further 
emphasized 

Mercado’s sentiment, saying 
Hussain has been a valuable 
resource in the creation of such 
a space for first-generation 
students.

“Adan Hussain, the First 

Generation project manager, 
is incredibly well informed on 
all the valuable resources that 
first-gens can tap into while 
they are a student at Michigan,” 
Zhao 
wrote. 
“Rather 
than 

gauging the success of the 
Gateway based on the number 
of students who visit it each 
month, I will know whether 
it was successful based on the 
friendships that form there 
throughout the year.”

In the wake of the numerous 

bias 
incidents 
that 
have 

occurred 
on 
campus, 
Zhao 

noted he perceives a failure of 
the University to recruit first-
generation students and ensure 
their safety on campus. He 
said in order to fully address 
the needs of first-generation 
students, the University must 
address the intersectionality 
of 
this 
group 
with 
other 

marginalized 
groups 
on 

campus.

“The 
University’s 
failure 

to properly respond to racist 
incidents such as the slurs 
found at West Quad represent 
the 
university’s 
failure 
to 

the 
first-gen 
student 
body. 

The exclusion of out-of-state 
students from the Go Blue 
Guarantee 
represents 
the 

exclusion 
of 
first-generation 

college students. Barriers faced 
by undocumented / DACAmented 
students on campus represents 
barriers faced by first-gens as 
well. To address the needs of 
first-gen students, the university 
must address the needs of LGBTQ 
students, students of color, low-
income students, etc.”

Mercado also lamented the 

University’s failure to provide 
adequate 
resources 
for 
first-

generation 
students 
before 

they submit their applications. 
Furthermore, 
she 
believes 

the University should provide 
better statistics regarding first-
generation students on campus.

“I 
believe 
the 
University 

should be doing a much better job 
in reaching out to first-generation 
students,” 
she 
said. 
“Most 

students that I know that are 
first-generation don’t know that a 
lot of resources exists on campus 
for them. The University should 
be putting out more information 
and being more proactive in the 
way they give resources out. Also, 
I think the University should be 
doing a better job at trying to get 
more first-generation students 
to apply here and giving them 
funds when need be. Statistics 
on first-generation students are 
not widely available to students 
which 
I 
think 
should 
be 

changed.”

year with two years of MBA 
education at the Business 
School. Upon conferral, both 
degrees will be awarded.

Bruce Mueller, associate 

dean of academic affairs at 
the College of Pharmacy, said 
the program, sourced from 
student demand, took about 
a year to craft and finalize. 
He said he spoke with many 
students interested in the 
program, and sees the dual 
degree as a way to make 
University 
students 
more 

marketable in the workforce 
after graduation.

“If (students) could learn 

about logistics and some of the 
things associated with business 
school along with a clinical 
pharmacy degree, they would 
have a unique set of skills that 
others wouldn’t have,” Mueller 
said.

The College of Pharmacy, 

in addition to the recent MBA 
program, has two other dual 
degree routes: one with the 
School of Public Health and 
another 
with 
the 
Medical 

School.

Pharmacy student Mason 

Benjamin 
is 
currently 

deliberating between the MBA 
and the MPH program. He 
said he’s interested in helping 
developing 
countries 
with 

inadequate care for diseases like 
malaria, and he has changed his 
original career path thanks to 
the dual degree programs in the 
College of Pharmacy.

“The 
University 
of 

Michigan, 
as 
far 
as 
the 

College of Pharmacy program 
goes, has an extraordinarily 
strong 
clinical 
program, 

which is what draws most of 
its applicants to the school,” 
he said. “But the University 
of Michigan also has a lot 
of emphasis on developing 
leadership capabilities in its 
applicants — so originally 
I went to pharmacy school 
thinking I wanted to practice 
clinical pharmacy, but then 
as I started to see some of 

the problems in the health 
care system currently … I got 
passionate about wanting to 
change that.”

Pharmacy 
student 
Rona 

Jin said dual degrees in the 
Business 
School 
and 
the 

School 
of 
Public 
Health 

can 
bring 
new 
pharmacy 

backgrounds into the world 
of “Big Pharma,” or sprawling 
pharmaceutical 
companies 

often 
accused 
of 
price 

gouging.

“If more PharmD students 

are in more business roles 
than 
just 
PharmD, 
they 

would be able to bring the 
perspective of a human aspect 
rather 
than 
the 
business 

aspect of plain numbers,” Jin 
said. “I feel like it balances out 
the issues we have right now 
with Big Pharma (who are) 
just concerned about their 
bottom line.”

Brad 
Killaly, 
associate 

dean for Full-Time and Global 
MBA Programs at the Business 
School, said understanding both 
the clinical and business sides of 
health care is necessary for the 
future success of both fields.

“It’s a complementarity that 

allows many of our students 
either in the Dental School or in 
the School of Pharmacology … a 
chance to both be the clinician 
or be the expert in the health 
care field that they need to be and 
also appreciate the complexities 
of the business of health care in 
order for them to become better 
clinicians,” Killaly said.

Benjamin said both the new 

MBA program and the Public 
Health 
dual 
degrees 
allow 

students to look at pharmacology 
with a wider scope and can give 
students the tools to work with 
societies and cultures.

“It opens up additional career 

trajectories,” 
Benjamin 
said. 

“Instead of focusing on direct 
patient care such as someone in 
a community pharmacy such as 
Walgreens or CVS or working in 
a hospital where you’re making 
decisions around medication 
therapy for the patient … 
these degrees would open 
up your possibility to treat 
populations 
instead 
of 

people.”

PHARMACY
From Page 1

The department offers majors 

in women’s studies and gender 
and health, in addition to three 
minors: 
gender 
and 
health; 

gender, race and nation; lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer 
and sexuality studies. According 
to Ceballo, there are 72 women’s 
studies majors, 65 gender and 
health majors and 113 students 
declared in the gender and health 
minor — the largest of the three. 
Ceballo noted these numbers 
change daily.

The department was the first in 

the country to offer joint doctoral 
degrees with other disciplinary 
departments 
— 
specifically, 

English, history and psychology.

As part of the women’s studies 

curriculum, 
undergraduate 

majors must complete 33 credits.

Specifically, they must take 

Women’s Studies 330, which 
Mendoza currently teaches.

He 
explained 
the 
course 

examines 
different 
types 
of 

feminist 
theory, 
including 

psychoanalytic, 
Marxist 
and 

transnational, 
among 
others. 

Central to the course, he wrote, is 
discussion of intersectionality.

“That is, (Women’s Studies 330) 

considers critically how feminist 
theory at its best always attends 
to the other differences that 
makes up a person’s subjecthood 
and political commitments, such 
as race, national background, 
gender 
identity, 
class 
and 

sexuality,” 
he 
wrote. 
“It’s 

required for all Women’s Studies 
majors precisely because it looks 
closely and critically at what we 
might understand as the feminist 
theory canon and the various 
methodological 
interventions 

that have emerged out of it.”

Ceballo also highlighted the 

intersectionality that arises in 
the field — the idea that how 
people experience the world is 
shaped not just by one social 
identity, but by the intersection 
of multiple, and that these will 
change in different situations and 
at different times. 

“The concept that we have 

to look at people’s multiple, 
simultaneously 
intersecting 

identities to understand people’s 
experiences in life is an important 
one that will come up, and to 
also 
understand 
how 
people 

have access to resources in our 
society,” she said.

Mary Kelley, Ruth Bordin 

collegiate professor of history, 
American culture and women’s 
studies, arrived at the University 
in 2002. Prior to joining the 
University faculty, she had been 
a history professor at Dartmouth 
College since 1977; she helped 
establish the women’s studies 
program at the college, which 

notably enrolled its first cohort 
of female students in 1972. She 
currently teaches a class at the 
University of Michigan called 
“Sex and Gender in United States 
History, 1600 to 2000.”

One 
central 
theme 
she 

introduces in her class is known as 
the equality-difference dilemma. 
It 
involves 
reconciling 
the 

emphasis upon sameness within 
the pursuit of equality, while also 
acknowledging difference.

“In 
other 
words, 
if 
you 

juxtapose equality and difference 
as a binary — equality being 
an emphasis upon ‘everyone is 
the same so therefore everyone 
should be equal’ — and you 
disregard obvious differences, 
and yet at the same time if you 
highlight difference, difference 
becomes the fulcrum for creating 
hierarchy,” she said. “So how 
do you incorporate difference 
without destroying or damaging 
the idea of equality based on 

DEPARTMENT
From Page 1

sameness?”

Kelley said in her class 

she works through this topic 
using a series of arguments. 
The 
underlying 
mantra 
to 

understand, 
she 
explained, 

is when people are equal 
they should not be treated 
differently but when people 
are different they should be 
treated equally through the 
incorporation of the difference 
in 
their 
circumstances 
— 

pregnancy leave and maternity 
leave, for example.

LSA 
senior 
Anastasia 

Pacifico is a women’s studies 
major in the Honors program; 
she is also a biology major. 
Currently she is taking Sexual 
Health and Clinical Science, 
which 
she 
said 
she 
likes 

because it incorporates both of 
her interests.

“It’s talking about sexuality 

through a medical lens, but also 
a critical feminist lens,” she 
said.

In terms of themes that recur 

in classes, Pacifico said social 
constructions are crucial, as 
well as talk of sexuality, income 
inequality and medicalization, 
among other topics. She said 
she has learned there are 
several 
different 
kinds 
of 

feminism and that people’s 
ideas of feminism differ.

“For 
example, 
white 

feminism — Ivanka Trump 
might think it’s feminist to 
have Betsy DeVos have a really 
big role in government,” she 
said. “But then when you look 
at the actual policies that 
Betsy DeVos is implementing, 
it’s bad for not just women, but 
people seeking an education 
and people from low-income 
areas, which is a feminist 
issue. So even though there is 
a woman in charge that doesn’t 
necessarily mean that it’s a 
feminist accomplishment. It’s 
all dependent on different 
perspectives.”

With regard to the gender 

and health major, Mendoza 
explained its courses look 
to incorporate a wide array 
of 
discourses 
surrounding 

aspects 
of 
health 
and 

associated topics.

“The gender and health courses 

articulates 
core 
feminist 
and 

interdisciplinary gender analysis to 
the study of varied aspects of health 
and populations, including health 
policies, 
reproductive 
justice, 

representations of the human body, 
sexual assault, disability, human 
sexuality and psychology,” he 
wrote.

W

hat can I say about 
my 
hometown 

in 
Northern 

Michigan? 
A 
small 
village 

right on the harbor, with 
plenty of hipster-y restaurants 
and 
quaint 
knick-knack 

shops, it’s the perfect spot for 
upper middle class families to 
vacation during the summer. 
Go a few miles out, and there 
is an endless supply of hiking 
trails and hunting spots for 
the more adventurous type. 
Tourists come every year to 
enjoy the beaches and take part 
in the small-town culture.

So what do I say when others 

ask me about where I grew up? 
Do I talk about how idyllic it 
was? To be able to go hiking 
in the wilderness whenever I 
wanted to have a view of the 
crystal clear waters every day 
of the year? How every fall, 
tourists came from all around 
to see the leaves that I drove 
by every day on my way to 
school, and how every summer, 
families would spend copious 
amounts of money to stay in 
the houses next door to my 
grandpa? About how I took 
the breathtaking nature for 
granted until I moved away and 
came to Ann Arbor?

Or will I talk about how after 

hearing my sister and me talk 
about what happened to our 
childhood friends, our friend had 
said, “What’s wrong with this 
place? Why is it that everyone 
died or went to prison?”

This type of contradiction 

was the undercurrent of my 
childhood, and has defined how 
I look back at those innocent 
years. When I was young, I 
honestly thought that I lived 
in the best place in the world. 
Sure, the world had problems, 
but 
those 
problems 
would 

never reach us all the way up 
north. I felt safe knowing that 
I was from a town too idyllic, 

too remote to ever be the 
center of anything scandalous. 
But as the years passed, and 
the cracks on the surface of 
my town’s reputation became 
more and more obvious, I 
began to lose the innocence 
and naïveté I had regarding 
the safety and wholesomeness 
of my hometown.

I 
know 
I’m 
incredibly 

privileged to have not had this 
veneer of stability shattered 
for so long. I had two parents 
that cared for me and my sister 
and took our lives and our 
education seriously, and for 
that I’m very grateful. But as 
I began to realize around my 
teenage years, this wasn’t the 
case for all my classmates. For 
some, the problems systemic to 
Northern Michigan had already 
become obvious to them at an 
early age.

Recently, 
news 
stories 

have emerged in local papers 
discussing a heroin problem 
and an overall drug problem 
in Northern Michigan. Grand 
Traverse 
County, 
the 
same 

county 
where 
the 
National 

Cherry Festival — an event 
to celebrate community and 
tourism — is held, is also ranked 
25 on the list of counties in 
Michigan with the most drug 
overdose 
deaths. 
A 
recent 

nationwide study also showed 
11 Northern Michigan counties 
were “among the top 5 percent at 
risk for the rapid spread of HIV.”

For many, myself included, it 

comes as a shock that the very 
place lauded for being family 
friendly and welcoming could 
hide something so dark just 
below the surface. But it’s also 
not fair, upon learning this 
information, to judge Northern 
Michigan as a type of rural, 
redneck, backwater place.

My hometown is not the 

idealized rural community that 
a lot of Michiganders believe 

it to be, but it’s also not the 
white trash place a lot of other 
people think it is. Like any 
place, Northern Michigan has a 
complicated history that has led 
up to a complicated present. Like 
any place, Northern Michigan 
has a lot of problems as well as a 
lot of amazing qualities.

So what will I say about my 

hometown? I’m not entirely 
sure yet. I know what others 
will say when I tell them where 
I’m from: probably a couple 
“My family owns a house up 
there,”s a few “You’re from 
such a beautiful place,”s and 
maybe even a “What was it 
like growing up so far away 
from everything?” It’s true 
that these responses really only 
reflect one side of Northern 
Michigan, but I can’t blame the 
people who see my hometown 
in its more idyllic form. I myself 
had a tilted view of my home 
until recently. 

I think the only lesson that 

can be learned from these 
experiences is that nothing 
is as perfect as it seems. No 
matter how beautiful and 
idyllic a place can be, there 
will 
always 
be 
something 

darker 
lying 
right 
below 

the surface. And this may 
be 
a 
depressing 
thought, 

but it’s also a wonderfully 
humanizing 
thought. 

Learning to see everything 
in a multidimensional light 
— that person you hate, your 
beliefs, that place you used 
to vacation at — is the mark 
of 
someone 
who 
is 
truly 

maturing. And though it’s 
painful to have to confront 
the ugly in something near 
and dear to your heart, the 
ability to see the world in a 
more nuanced way is valuable 
beyond compare.

FROM THE DAILY

More transparency, please

A

fter the 2016 election, University of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel received criticism from conservative students and faculty 
who believed his politicized comments at a Diag vigil marginalized 

conservative viewpoints since public officials are expected to remain 
neutral. That November, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy — a nonprofit 
research-based think tank — filed a Freedom of Information Act request for 
emails from Schlissel containing the word “Trump.”

This month, the University 

settled a lawsuit from the 
Mackinac Center claiming the 
information the center had 
requested in November was 
not released in a timely matter. 
As a result of the lawsuit, the 
University 
released 
seven 

additional emails (11 in total) 
regarding the election. The 
University’s failure to follow 
basic transparency protocol 
inflated the importance of 
the 
released 
emails. 
The 

Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial 

Board implores the University 
to hold itself accountable to 
its own transparency in its 
actions and decisions.

The 
emails 
in 
question 

contained little information 
the public did not already know, 
or at the very least, assume. 
As someone who has publicly 
criticized President Donald 
Trump and his policies, it was 
no surprise that Schlissel’s 
emails revealed his concern 
about a Trump presidency. His 
small, albeit partisan, worries 
displayed a normal human 
reaction to what we believe 
to be a concerning presidency. 
The closest he even gets in his 
emails 
to 
“discriminating” 

against conservative students 
on campus is to point out the 

irony of Trump supporters 
feeling 
“marginalized 
and 

ostracized in our campus,” when 
Trump’s 
policies 
marginalize 

countless 
groups 
in 
society. 

Otherwise, 
Schlissel 
remains 

relatively 
moderate 
when 

expressing his feelings toward the 
administration and its supporters, 
even in private discourse.

Given the uncontroversial 

nature of President Schlissel’s 
emails, 
we 
believe 
the 

University’s 
slow 
response 

time to the Mackinac Center’s 
FOIA 
request 
caused 
the 

controversy. The center only 
proceeded to sue the University 
because it took 46 work days to 
procure the first four emails, a 
task that was estimated to take 
2 hours and 45 minutes. The 
University claimed the delay 
was due to the high volume 
of FOIA requests filed in 
January, when the Mackinac 
Center made their request. The 
Mackinac 
Center 
therefore 

capitalized on the University’s 
slow 
response, 
creating 

controversy over something 
entirely 
noncontroversial. 

Had the University acted in a 
timely manner in completing 
the FOIA request, it is quite 
possible the findings would 
have flown under the radar.

Moreover, dragging out the 

release of the emails allowed 
the Mackinac Center to bring 
more attention to the real 
problem of transparency at 
the University. But, given the 
mildness of Schlissel’s emails, 
it makes little sense why the 
University chose to wait for a 
lawsuit before releasing the 
last seven emails. As part of 
the settlement, the University 
has agreed to review and 
change 
its 
FOIA 
policy, 

including moving away from 
charging fees for 75 percent 
of responses, hiring two new 
personnel to manage FOIA 
requests and publishing annual 
FOIA response performance 
reports. Since FOIA requests 
often carry lofty price tags 
or an unreadable volume of 
information, these are tangible 
steps the University can take 
to increase their transparency, 
and we hope they follow 
through on these plans.

Increased 
transparency 

will ultimately only help the 
University in the long run, 
as it will allow them to avoid 
extraneous 
“scandals” 
and 

lawsuits like this one. We 
implore the University to hold 
itself accountable to its own 
transparency from here on out.

s seen on The Michigan 
Daily’s Facebook page 
and 
website 
in 
the 

comments of my article about 
the 
importance 
of 
having 

spaces for straight men to 
grapple pressing issues facing 
minorities, many people dislike 
my opinion, and that’s OK. 
However, it worries me that 
many of the responses devolve 
into demeaning insults that 
are anything but constructive. 
Anything 
that 
silences 

conversation and the exchange 
of ideas only hurts the position 
that marginalized commenters 
advocate for because they have 
nothing to gain and everything 
to lose from this approach. The 
worst of all is telling someone 
to “check their privilege.”

First, 
what 
is 
privilege 

and how does one check it? 
Privilege is the combination 
of 
social 
identities 
that 

grants 
someone 
unearned 

advantages, like being white 
or male in the job market. 
To check one’s privilege is 
to acknowledge that society 
“grants unearned rewards to 
certain people based on their 
race, gender, sexuality, etc.” 
and “the role those rewards 
play in one’s life and the lives 
of less privileged people.” On 
the surface, there is nothing 
wrong with you asking people 
to acknowledge that others are 
less fortunate than another.

However, 
checking 
one’s 

privilege is complicated. Let 
me be clear: Individual men 
need to learn to understand 
perspective, and marginalized 
people should continue calling 
them out for it. But if you 
agree that privilege blinds 
people 
from 
understanding 

marginalized 
perspectives, 

then 
it 
follows 
that 
the 

privileged must be educated 
about these perspectives in 
order to see them. In other 
words, 
how 
can 
someone 

expect you to “check your 
privilege” if you don’t know 
what’s wrong? And just as 
importantly, why would you?

The 
harsh 
reality 
is 

that 
people 
in 
a 
position 

of 
privilege 
benefit 
more 

from ignoring marginalized 
perspectives 
than 
listening 

to them. As one GoFundMe 

humorously shows, engaging 
with 
intersectionality 
and 

feminism strips white men 
of their very real privilege 
to “acknowledge that (they) 
have unearned privilege but to 
ignore what it means.” On top 
of that, the structural systems 
of oppression blind them to 
the 
struggles 
others 
face, 

leaving it up to marginalized 
voices to force their way 
into the conversation. The 
conversation is biased against 
marginalized 
people 
from 

the get-go. However, shutting 
down 
the 
conversation 
by 

saying “check your privilege” 
is a counterproductive way to 
approach the situation.

It 
is 
counterproductive 

because when you use this 
phrase, 
you 
intentionally 

or 
unintentionally 
express 

frustration 
and 
arrogance 

— frustration because you 
shouldn’t 
have 
to 
educate 

peers about this in the 21st 
century 
and 
arrogance 

because it implies an “I know 
better than you” attitude. The 
problem is that the people 
who are told this phrase are 
rarely the people who look up 
privilege in their free time. In 
this case, if you want someone 
to understand their privilege, 
you have to lay it out because 
it is the privilege itself that 
prevents them from seeing it 
for themselves; it’s a Catch-22, 
one that hurts marginalized 
people more than those whom 
it afflicts.

On the other end, people 

who 
are 
subject 
to 
this 

reproach are frustrated by 
this lack of understanding 
and, from an argumentative 
perspective, it’s a cop-out. The 
phrase implies an argument 
for something they did wrong 
without revealing to them 
what it is; because they don’t 
know what they did wrong, 
they can’t begin to understand 
or correct their error. This 
putdown is easiest to unpack, 
but any other comment that 
fails 
to 
directly 
address 

something problematic has the 
same effect.

Consider these comments, 

including 
quite 
a 
few 

comments asking me to “check 
(my) privilege:” “Yes, please 

tell me more about how hard 
it is to not comprehend actual 
systemic oppression,” “How 
about you all grow the f*** 
up,” “Go talk to ur straight 
white men!!!” 

Besides 
perhaps 

therapeutically 
releasing 

frustration, 
none 
of 
these 

comments are productive to 
public dialogue, which was the 
point of my article. This type 
of reply leaves no room for 
conversation because there is 
no way to respond to a problem 
when they don’t know what the 
problem is. That’s like trying 
to fix a leak in a boat without 
knowing where the hole is. 
Similarly, if you want those 
with privilege to understand 
what was wrong with their 
comment or action, you must 
deconstruct their error instead 
of just shutting them down, 
even if that is not your intent. 

If 
you 
want 
productive 

political change, then you 
must start with yourself and 
your own tone even though 
that’s simply not fair. It’s not 
fair that you have to police 
your 
own 
emotions 
and 

privileged people don’t. It’s 
not fair that you have to keep 
the conversation open but they 
can disregard you. It’s not fair 
that they have privilege and 
everything is stacked in their 
favor so that they don’t have 
to care but you must. That’s 
the cards that were dealt; the 
rules suck, but this is how to 
win the game. 

We live in a world where 

people who you disagree with 
will be wrong, and they will 
come out on top. It is not enough 
to be right, even when you are. 
White men may still disregard 
your logic, but if you truly want 
them to “check their privilege,” 
it’s better to open a conversation 
on the off chance they listen 
than to shut it down from the 
get-go. Using the term “check 
your privilege” only further 
alienates men who may put in a 
real effort to understand.

Yes, many do not. But in the 

cases where they do, shutting 
down conversation only hurts 
your cause.

FLORIAN KOPPE

Future Islands authentic, 
exciting in Royal Oak show

In 2014, after the release of 

their fourth album, Singles, 
Baltimore-based 
Future 

Islands were propelled from 
relative obscurity to immediate 
relevance in the wake of their 
performance 
of 
“Seasons 

(Waiting On You)” on the Late 
Show with David Letterman. 
Three years later, their fifth 
album — second with indie 
behemoth 4AD — was released 
to considerably less pomp. 
Nevertheless, The Far Field 
(2017) built on the success of 
Singles and confirmed the 
band’s status as the best synth-
pop revival act in the business.

A longtime fan of Future 

Islands, 
I 
was 
somewhat 

unsure of what to expect going 
into their show at Royal Oak 
Music 
Theatre. 
Frontman 

Sam Herring (a.k.a. Hemlock 
Ernst) has gained renown for 
his absurd energy and oddly 
acrobatic dancing and having 
seen the band once before, 
in 2015, I knew what he was 
capable. I wondered, however, 
how Far Field, a less vocals-
driven album than Singles or 
On the Water (2011), would 
translate to the stage.

Much to my delight, Future 

Islands seemed only to have 
become 
better 
performers 

in 
the 
time 
since 
Singles 

was released. Show openers 
“Beauty of the Road” followed 
by “Ran,” along with several 
others from Far Field, were 
tight and forward-moving, with 
a sense of urgency even more 
palpable than possessed by 
their studio versions. In front 
of the caricatured calmness 
of straight-faced keyboardist-
synth master Gerrit Welmers, 
bassist 
William 
Cashion 

and (considerably less stoic) 
drummer 
Michael 
Lowry, 

Herring’s 
passion 
had 
no 

difficulty asserting itself as 
the most alluring aspect of the 
performance.

Indeed, fewer than three 

songs in, Herring — looking 
more 
like 
your 
typical 

lumberjack 
than 
a 
touring 

musician — had already sweat 
completely through his plaid 

button-up. Throughout the set, 
he would occasionally smack 
his chest with the fist not 
holding the mic, and the wet, 
slapping sound could actually 
be heard through the speakers. 
When the light was just right, 
you could even see the droplets 
of sweat violently flung from 
the fabric over his heart, 
an 
unexpectedly 
poignant 

reminder of the immediacy of 
the show and the emotion it 
encapsulated.

In 
some 
ways, 
a 

Future 
Islands 
show 
is 

straightforward. 
With 
just 

drums, 
synth 
and 
bass, 

there’s not much room for 
improvisation, nor do the songs 
themselves allow much space 
for deviation. At the same 
time, though, most of Future 
Islands’ albums — Far Field 
and their debut, Wave Like 
Home (2008) — were recorded 
without drums, but played 
with them on tour. The result 
is popular favorites from 2010’s 
In Evening Air (“Long Flight,” 
“Vireo’s Eye”) and On the 
Water (”Balance”) originally 
winding 
and 
unconcerned 

with reaching a destination 
transformed 
into 
pounding 

anthems. Highlights of the 
show were almost all cuts 
from In Evening Air, at once 
atmospheric and driving.

“Inch of Dust,” in particular, 

stood out among the rest, as 
did the devastating combo of 
“Seasons” directly into “Tin 
Man” and then “Spirit,” three 
of their most earnest and 
melodic songs across all five 
albums. Though likely among 
their less well-known tunes, 
“Inch of Dust,” off the backside 
of 
In 
Evening 
Air, 
found 

Herring at his most beastly. 
He howled, a furious ball of 
passion bouncing off the walls 
and down to the floor as the 
lights strobed, while Cashion 
and Welmers harped on the 
same chord, each time louder 
than the last until it crashed, 
all at once, like a dam finally 
overtaken by the incessant 
pounding of the river at its 
back.

In addition to his now-

signature dance moves, another 
of 
the 
delightful 
surprises 

of a Future Islands show is 
Herring’s voice. After no more 

than a song or so, it’s clear that 
he has something special. His 
range and natural, emotive 
rasp lend themselves well to the 
band’s generally melancholic, 
if energetic, songs. Live, he 
takes it to another level, calling 
on the ghosts of punk’s angry 
past to conjure up a hearty, 
grating shout. On Thursday, he 
peppered in his invigorating 
growl wherever he saw fit, 
drawing 
at 
first 
stunned 

silence, immediately followed 
by applause and a chorus of 
“whoop”s.

As a band, Future Islands 

boast an impressive energy 
that 
both 
contrasts 
and 

complements 
the 
nostalgia 

innate to their genre quite 
well. More than that, though, 
they are honest, unassuming 
and real, through and through. 
They are performers, no doubt, 
but they aren’t putting on an 
act. I remember reading a 
quote somewhere about how 
Herring looks like the guy 
checking out next to you at 
the grocery store, and there’s 
something really powerful (not 
to mention true) about that. 
Not only does he look like your 
average 33-year-old — with an 
endearing, 
quickly-receding 

hairline — but he acts like one 
too, a quality that bolsters 
his image as, in a sense, the 
everyman’s poet.

Before playing certain songs, 

Herring gave quick backstories 
— “North Star,” for example, 
was written about a long 
evening he spent trapped at the 
Detroit airport — one of which 
was 
particularly 
striking. 

During 
the 
show’s 
encore, 

before the only song they 
played from Wave Like Home, 
“Little Dreamer,” he spoke 
about a 10-year-old love that 
still haunts him, the beauty of 
it and the pit of sorrow that 
wells up within him. He spoke 
with a candor, tears welling up 
in his eyes, that made his words 
incapable of being dismissed. 
That raw emotion, from the 
highs of “Seasons” or “Spirit” 
to the goosebumps-inducing 
melancholy preceding “Little 
Dreamer” is ultimately why 
you go to a Future Islands show 
and why there is no doubt in 
my mind that they are one of 
the best touring bands today.

At times I could feel my 

bones 
reverberate 
with 

the sound of the music last 
Sunday at the Masonic Temple 
in 
Detroit. 
Sitting 
there, 

surrounded by thousands of 
other people who were all 
experiencing the same thing 
as me, unable to hear anything 
but the baritone strains of 
Matt Berninger’s voice, the 
pounding of the drums and the 
strumming of guitars, I took 
in an event unlike any other I 
have experienced. Certainly it 
was louder than most anything 
else I’ve come across, but not 
in a bad way. When I left the 
concert I was feeling too much 
of a rush to think of much of 
anything, but after letting it 
settle for a few days, I have a 
few things to say.

The National is an indie 

rock band (whatever exactly 
that 
means) 
which 
was 

founded some 18 years ago in 
Cleveland, Ohio. Made up of 
vocalist Matt Berninger and 
two sets of brothers, Bryce and 
Aaron Dessner and Scott and 
Bryan Devendorf, the band is 
a staple of what could perhaps 
be best described as Very Sad 
Rock™. Over the course of 
their seven studio albums and 
years of concertizing, the band 
has established a large and 
committed fan base. They have 
performed at political events 
for President Barack Obama, 
appeared 
on 
“Late 
Night 

with Jimmy Fallon” and been 
featured on such hit TV shows 
as “Game of Thrones” and 
“Boardwalk 
Empire.” 
Their 

latest album, Sleep Well Beast 
— the promotion of which was 
the raison d’être of the concert 
I attended — features a single 
which currently tops the U.S. 
Adult Alternative Songs chart, 
“The System Only Dreams in 
Total Darkness.”

Yes, this is the classical 

music column. Be patient.

I 
first 
learned 
of 
The 

National because I heard a 
piece of classical chamber 
music. Specifically, a piece 
called 
“Murder 
Ballades,” 

which was featured on the 
2015 album Filament by eighth 
blackbird, one of the most 
talented and interesting new 
music 
chamber 
ensembles 

active today. At the time, I was 
listening rather exclusively to 
classical music (a mistake), and 
had no idea who the composer 
of “Murder Ballades” was, a 
man named Bryce Dessner. 
A 
quick 
bit 
of 
Googling 

established 
his 
identity 
as 

a guitarist “best known as 
a member of the Grammy 
Award-nominated band The 
National.” 
I 
really 
hadn’t 

expected that.

That was perhaps the start 

of my unlearning of several 
misconceptions I held about 
the nature and identity of the 
people we call composers. 
Often 
times, 
there 
is 

something about the word that 
we tend to sanctify. There’s 
some part of the label that 
has to be preserved, a latent, 
exclusionary aspect that says 
that a composer can be this but 
not that. A composer can be a 
violinist but not a rock star. A 
composer’s music can be played 
in an opera house but not in a 
stadium. And because of the 
way that the term is viewed, 
many people who ought to be 
thought of as composers are 
left out.

This isn’t necessarily the 

case 
with 
Bryce 
Dessner. 

While his fame certainly is 
due to his role in The National, 
he also fulfils the traditional 
definition of composer in his 
other work. First off, he has 
the pedigree for it, having 
earned a master’s from Yale 
School of Music, one of the 
most 
prestigious 
graduate 

programs 
in 
the 
country. 

Beyond that, he has plenty 
of music composed in what 

would be termed the classical 
tradition — that is, notated on 
paper and given to performers 
for 
interpretation. 
His 

compositions generally sound 
vaguely post-minimalist, if you 
wanted to know (and can bear 
to hear music pigeonholed like 
that). In addition to eighth 
blackbird, he has written for 
some of the most prestigious 
classical 
ensembles 
in 
the 

country, including The Kronos 
Quartet and the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. So most anyone 
would 
agree 
that 
he’s 
a 

composer.

The same can largely be 

said 
of 
Radiohead’s 
Jonny 

Greenwood, who wrote the 
marvelous 
score 
to 
Paul 

Thomas 
Anderson’s 
2007 

film “There Will Be Blood.” 
But there are others whose 
activities aren’t so straight-
forward. Some are electronic 
musicians, 
artists 
who 

compose 
and 
relay 
music 

on their own and with their 
own tools. In her marvelous 
podcast “Meet the Composer,” 
violist Nadia Sirota discussed 
this particular subset in depth: 
“We’re as apt to call a composer 
who works with technology, 
who composes without pen 
and paper, inside the box of 
a computer, a producer,” she 
said. “A producer. Is that fair? 
Is that apt?”

One example of this group 

of composers, and one which 
Sirota talks about extensively, 
is Matmos, an electronic duo 
from Baltimore who record and 
manipulate their own samples 
to create music that is unusual, 
complex and compelling. Their 
latest 
album 
in 
particular 

is a brilliant contribution, a 
work called Ultimate Care 
II, named after the washing 
machine 
which 
resides 
in 

their 
basement. 
For 
this 

composition, the pair recorded 
sounds 
entirely 
from 
this 

washing machine, and through 
their 
artistic 
choices 
and 

electronic manipulation, they 
created something wonderful 
and without compare.

But are they composers? I 

struggle to find a reason why 
not. After all, if a composer is 
simply one who writes music 
(and what else could it be?), 
then this certainly qualifies. 
They and countless others 
write music that never sees the 
inside of a concert hall, never 
finds itself in the hands of an 
orchestra, but is nevertheless a 
composition.

So what is it that makes 

Mitski or Sufjan a singer-
songwriter and Kendrick a 
rapper, while Augusta Read 
Thomas gets to be a composer? 
Is it the fact that the music 
has words? Composers write 
songs, too. Is it that they wrote 
the words themselves? Didn’t 
Wagner also? Is it the fact 
that it’s rap? Is rap not music? 
At its heart, perhaps what it’s 
all about is simple clarity, an 
effort to differentiate between 
genres: Part of it doubtless 
stems from the inescapable 
human compulsion to arrange 
things in little boxes and 
shut the lids, the drive to 
compartmentalize and classify 
and draw the boundaries just 
so. But innocent as this may 
seem, the way in which we use 
language goes a long way into 
changing how we think about 
the world. Maybe Kendrick 
is a rapper. But he can be a 
composer too. And when we 
forget that is when we close 
ourselves off to the possible.

Who gets to be 
a composer?

NEW LINE CINEMA

‘Harold and Kumar’ is an 
outsized, intelligent satire

FILM REAPPRAISAL

In Reappraisals, Michigan Daily 

film writers attempt to defend films 
that have been critically maligned.

This week: “Harold and Kumar 

Escape from Guantanamo Bay.”

The 
“Harold 
and 
Kumar” 

franchise might fall under the 
category 
of 
“stoner 
comedy,” 

but these films are littered with 
clever observations on race and 
politics. The second installment, 
“Harold 
and 
Kumar 
Escape 

from Guantanamo Bay,” received 
only mild reviews. It challenges 
stereotypes throughout the movie, 
however, in a way the first and 

third films do not accomplish as 
successfully.

Harold (John Cho, “Columbus”) 

and Kumar (Kal Penn, “How I Met 
Your Mother”) are roommates 
planning a trip to Amsterdam as 
a romantic gesture. Harold is an 
investment banker, while Kumar 
purposefully failed to apply to 
medical 
school. 
Unfortunately, 

Kumar’s marijuana-related habits 
lead to their arrest and sentencing 
to Guantanamo Bay. Through a 
series of improbable, but hilarious, 
fortunes and misfortunes, the two 
end up on the run from Homeland 
Security.

“Guantanamo 
Bay,” 
released 

in 
2008 
when 
awareness 
of 

xenophobia was not at the forefront 
of popular discourse, examines the 

justice system and the way America 
treats minorities in a revealing 
light. At airport security, Kumar is 
subjected to racial profiling through 
a “random” search (although he 
did make a scene to smuggle in 
drugs). Then, on board the plane, a 
racist elderly white woman views 
Kumar as a turban-wearing, beard-
sporting, evilly-laughing terrorist, 
when he is really a goofy Indian guy 
in a sloppy outfit. When she sees 
him light a makeshift bong in the 
lavatory, she screams “Terrorist!” 
and sends the flight into chaos.

Harold and Kumar wait in an 

interrogation room as an idiotic and 
racist Homeland Security officer, 
Ron Fox (Rob Corddry, “The Daily 
Show with Jon Stewart”), celebrates 
capturing a member of Al Qaeda 

and a North Korean terrorist. Of 
course, these two are actually just 
American citizens with bad luck. 
Through 
its 
absurdist 
humor, 

“Harold and Kumar Escape from 
Guantanamo Bay” addresses the 
way 
obsessed 
politicians 
treat 

suspected 
terrorists. 
The 
two 

friends have no right to an attorney, 
a trial or, as Fox puts it, “freedoms.”

After 
Harold 
and 
Kumar 

miraculously escape prison, the 
film questions the stereotypes they 
view the world through. They meet 
a group of Cubans on their way to 
America without documentation 
who are kind enough to transport 
them to Florida. Later, the pair 
interrupts a street basketball game 
in 
a 
rundown 
neighborhood, 

accidentally destroying the shoes 
and jukebox of many muscular Black 

men. Harold and Kumar decide to 
flee, but their unfounded prejudices 
are revealed when the men bring 
out tools to help fix the pair’s car. 
The only stereotyped group the 
film does not spare are some white 
supremacists the friends encounter 
who are ridiculed without mercy.

‘Lil Pump’ delivers hype 
despite lack of substance

Lil Pump is neither meaningful 

nor innovative. It has no message 
or theme, and Lil Pump very 
clearly has nothing of substance 
to say — but if you 
are listening to Lil 
Pump 
expecting 

something 
meaningful, 
you 

are listening to Lil 
Pump for the wrong 
reason.

17-year-old Lil Pump emerged 

out of Miami, a member of the 
South Florida wave that includes 
rappers such as xxxtentacion, 
$ki Mask the Slump God and 
wifisfuneral. These artists have 
in common varying degrees of 
manic-depressive 
tendencies, 

hedonistic worldviews, disregard 
for convention and raw energy. 
Lil Pump tends toward the latter 
three, his lyrical themes never 
delving beyond the debaucherous. 
He 
first 
gained 
fame 
on 

Soundcloud with the single “D 
Rose,” accompanied by a fantastic 
music video shot by visual artist 
Cole Bennett (whose videos are 
a veritable who’s who of up-and-
coming 
rappers). 
Follow-up 

releases “Boss” and “Gucci Gang” 
helped propel him to further viral 
fame, half of which stemmed from 
an appreciation (more often than 
not ironic) of his wild and rowdy 
aesthetic, while the other half 
stemmed from unbridled hatred 
of everything about him.

Lil 
Pump 
is 
certainly 
a 

controversial 
figure. 
Many 

feel that he is furthering the 
devolution of rap music with 
his 
shallow 
lyricism; 
others 

appreciate the mindless hype. 
He has become something of a 
running joke on the internet due 
to his songs and persona at times 
feeling like an astute parody of 
Soundcloud-rap culture.

No matter if you love him or 

hate him, you can’t deny that Lil 
Pump goes hard. Every song is 

as intense as the 
last — Lil Pump 
does 
not 
take 

breaks. 
South 

Florida 
rapper 

and 
frequent 

collaborator, 
Smokepurpp, has 

repeatedly described the music of 
Florida as “ignorant,” and Lil Pump 
certainly fits this description. The 
instrumentation is dominated by 
chilly dissonant bells and piano 
floating on top of bass that sounds 
like the producer turned the 
volume to eleven. This blown-out 
style is characteristic of producer 
Ronny J, a big influence on the 
South Florida sound, responsible 
for hard-hitting tracks such as 
“Ultimate” 
by 
Denzel 
Curry 

and “Gospel” by Rich Chigga. 
Ronny J is credited on three 
tracks across the album, sharing 
production with an assortment of 
lesser-known producers such as 
Mr. 2-17 and Bighead. 808 Mafia 
member TM88 is responsible for 
the eerie “Foreign,” one of the 
album’s highlights. The beats are 
often poorly mixed and cheap, but 
always fun and energetic. Joining 
Lil Pump are an assortment of 
big ticket rappers, most notably a 
cosign from fellow Miami rapper 
Rick Ross. The songs featuring 
these artists are the high points 
of the album (not including the 
singles) as they tend to actually be 
properly mixed, and the features 
provide some respite from Lil 

Pump’s rather repetitive nature. 
With that being said, the featuring 
artists never steal the show — Lil 
Pump does a surprisingly good job 
of holding his own, and you never 
forget that you’re listening to his 
album. 

Lil Pump has major faults 

— while Lil Pump does not 
intend to convey much meaning 
through his songs, his lyrics are 
still impressively bad. No matter 
how much unruly charisma Lil 
Pump possesses, there are only 
so many times he can repeat the 
phrase “Gucci Gang” before it 
gets boring. It is possible, as Lil 
Pump’s guests remind us, to make 
a song go hard without the lyrics 
beginning to feel like some sort of 
sacrilegious, barred-out mantra. 
The repetitiveness is at least 
tempered by some surreal bars: 
Across the span of the album Lil 
Pump turns down Harvard, sells 
cocaine to your grandma and has 
a stroke — not necessarily in that 
order. While it’s likely Lil Pump’s 
intention to embrace the lo-fi
 

aesthetic dominating Soundcloud 
rap now, most of the tracks on this 
album sound like ersatz Ronny 
J beats, often terribly mixed 
(looking at you, “Boss”). This 
combination of mind-numbingly 
stupid bars and often chintzy 
beats becomes increasingly more 
difficult to stomach as the album 
grinds on, and it doesn’t help that 
Lil Pump spends the whole time 
reminding the listener that he 
has had sex with seemingly every 
member of your extended family.

If you want to turn your brain 

off and feel the pure hype of Lil 
Pump course through your veins, 
listening to Lil Pump is a good 
move. If that doesn’t appeal to you, 
you’re going to really hate this 
album.

‘Wadjda’ is a rousing tale 
of female empowerment

In “From the Vault,” Daily Arts 

takes a new look at old films.

It’s your 18th birthday. Your 

parents generously hand you the 
jingling keys to a 2006 Subaru. This 
is the most momentous moment of 
your adolescent life thus far. You 
are a woman.

Unfortunately, for women in 

Saudi Arabia, this rite of passage 

has never been a reality due to 
strict laws that divide genders in 
the country — creating two very 
separate spheres of life. On Sept. 
26, 2017, however, those harsh lines 
began to blur when Saudi Arabia’s 
King Salman issued a decree that 
now allows women to drive for the 
first time in the nation.

In 
2012, 
the 
first 
Saudi 

Arabian female director, Haifaa 
al-Mansour 
(“Mary 
Shelley”), 

directed “Wadjda” and instilled 
in her titular protagonist (Waad 
Mohammed) a desire that Saudi 
Arabian women alike shared: to 
drive. No, not drive a car, because 
al-Mansour understood that this 
was not a possibility, but rather 
drive something else: a bike. 
Al-Mansour imbued her story with 
the sentiment that these women 
wanted to be able to drive, or to 

take control, of the even smallest 
parts of their lives without a male 
voice dictating how they could 
transport themselves. This notion 
of female driving is not new; in 
Paula Vogel’s 1997 play, “How I 
Learned to Drive,” the notion of 
driving a car means much more 
than physically steering, but rather 
assuming agency over one’s goals, 
desires and maturation.

When Wadjda puts her mind to 

something, she gets it. She sticks 
out as funky and unconventional 
— her coarse, espresso-rich, mane-
like hair is always unruly (she has 
better things to do than sit in front 
of a mirror for hours and straighten 
her locks until they become burnt 
ends like her mother’s), and her ear 
lobes are lined with sparkly studs. 
So when Wadjda decides that she 
will win her school’s Koran contest 
to win money to pay for a bike — 
for her first ever opportunity at 
freedom — she really does it.

“Wadjda” opens up with Wadjda 

and her fellow schoolgirls singing 
verses from the Koran, as the 
camera traces their Mary Jane 
loafers in a tight close up until 
Wadjda’s scuffed, gothic Chuck 
Taylors with violet laces stand out 
from the rest. She is no ordinary 
girl. 
The 
next 
scene 
shows 

Wadjda counting up her riyals in 
hustler fashion, as she listens to 
Grouplove’s 2011 bubbly pop rock 
song “Tongue Tied.” Al-Mansour 
not-so-subtly depicts that Wadjda’s 
desires stretch way farther than 
the Arabian Peninsula, especially 
those desires which make her 
want to be seen as an equal to the 
opposite sex.

Wadjda doesn’t ask for much; 

she spends most of her time alone. 
She doesn’t expect her totalitarian 
headmaster, Ms. Hussa, to give 
her any respect. When Wadjda 

wins the Koran contest and Ms. 
Hussa gives the funds instead to 
Palestine and not to Wadjda, she is 
disappointed but from surprised. 
She doesn’t ask her negligent 
father to give her attention as he 
goes between his two families. She 
doesn’t think of her male peers as 
anything more than an immature. 
When Wadjda’s mother tells her 
that her father likes her hair long 
and straight as a way to attempt 
to seem attractive to him and save 
their relationship, Wadjda rolls her 
eyes, telling the audience that even 

at a young age, she recognizes that 
changing oneself to appeal to men 
is foolish.

“Wadjda” 
closes 
with 

bittersweet fireworks, as Wadjda 
and her mother embrace. They 
watch 
her 
father’s 
marriage 

ceremony 
from 
their 
stucco 

balcony, as if, finally, they are 
both in sync that pleasing a man 
is an impossible battle and that 
female companionship is steady. 
It is a tough pill to swallow, but 
Wadjda persists nonetheless, and 
the audience senses that in this 
lonesome moment, she is not alone. 
It is as if Wadjda helped initiate 
the battle for equality and being 
the driver of one’s own life, so now 
Saudi Arabian girls like her can 
ride their bikes (and cars) off to 
freedom into the burning Middle-
Eastern sun.

FILM REVIEW
‘Victoria & Abdul’ misses mark

WARNER BROS. RECORDS

“Victoria & Abdul” is the latest 

entry in the surprisingly crowded 
“British 
imperialism 
drama” 

genre, following on films like 
“Viceroy’s House” and “A United 
Kingdom,” in which a white 
English person finds themselves 
in a type of Odd Couple-dynamic 
with a person from a country 
under colonialist rule and forms 
a close bond with them. It is the 
latest film to take a story that begs 
to serve as a criticism of a power-
hungry system of governing and 
instead uses it as a trite dramedy. 
While certainly well-acted and 
intermittently 
endearing, 
it 

completely misses 
and 
sometimes 

seemingly 
intentionally 
obfuscates 
what 

should have been 
the thesis of its 
entire narrative.

The film tells the true story of 

the friendship between Queen 
Victoria (Dame Judi Dench, 
“Miss Peregrine’s Home for 
Peculiar Children”) and her 
Indian servant, Abdul Karim 
(Ali Fazal, “For Here or To 
Go?”). Historically, the two were 

incredibly close, with Karim 
acting as a sort of teacher to the 

Queen on subjects 
relating to Indian 
culture. Before her 
death, she would 
have knighted him 
as a Commander 
of 
the 
Royal 

Victorian 
Order 

despite the friction 
it 
caused 
with 

members of her house.

To state the obvious, Dench 

is fantastic as Queen Victoria 
– reprising the role she played 
in 1997’s “Mrs. Brown” — and 
she brings all the gravitas and 
emotional complexity that one 
would expect of an actress of her 

regal reputation. The script is 
rather ham-fisted in its treatment 
of her, climaxing in the most 
Oscar-baiting speech of the year, 
but the flaws have nothing to do 
with Dench’s work. As Abdul, 
Fazal is perfectly charming and 
shares a nice camaraderie with 
Adeel Akhtar (“The Big Sick”) 
in earlier scenes, but again 
due to the writing, he comes 
across 
as 
disappointingly 

one-dimensional. He is all too 
rarely given the opportunity to 
do anything other than smile 
and offer praise and wisdom to 
Victoria.

It is clearly that script, 

written by Lee Hall (“War 
Horse”), which is the film’s 

biggest 
stumbling 
block. 

“Victoria & Abdul” is fine, if 
all too slight in its first half 
as it deals with the developing 
friendship between its two 
titular characters. It’s in the 
second half that it devolves 
into 
a 
series 
of 
blustery, 

tittering 
confrontations 

between Victoria and her staff, 
all but completely abandoning 
the bond at the core of the 
story and robbing Abdul of 
all agency. He becomes a 
background player in a film in 
which he is ostensibly one of 
the stars.

What to Watch For: Can O’Korn bounce back against Indiana?

Michigan (1-1 Big Ten, 4-1 

overall) has its sights set on 
running the table.

The 17th-ranked Wolverines 

lost their first game of the 
season last week, and now they 
face the daunting challenge 
of 
bouncing 
back 
from 

disappointment. With the bye 
week already behind it, the 
Michigan football team hasn’t 
had much time to process its 
shocking 
loss 
to 
Michigan 

State.

But the Wolverines can’t 

afford to allow the setback to 
linger in their minds, and they 
have said as much throughout 

the week. Their goal is to win 
out, starting with Indiana on 
Saturday.

Here’s what to watch for 

when 
Michigan 
travels 
to 

Bloomington to take on the 
Hoosiers:

1. Can John O’Korn bounce 

back?

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

themselves said the fault for the 
unexpected defeat should be 
spread around evenly amongst 
the 
team, 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback John O’Korn did 
throw three interceptions on 
three consecutive possessions 
amid a raging monsoon.

While he doesn’t necessarily 

call the plays, he still has to 
execute them when called upon, 
which he readily admitted after 
the game last Saturday. He also 
has to be a beacon of leadership, 
as Michigan will need to lean 
on him against Indiana.

As 
has 
been 
clearly 

documented, O’Korn has faced 
his fair share of adversity both 
before and during his Wolverine 
career. Perhaps more so than 
many of his teammates, he 
should have an understanding 
of how to turn bumps in the 
road into breakthroughs.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
be 

counting on O’Korn to correct 
course, both for himself and 
for the team, in order to avoid 
another 
stumbling 
block 

against the Hoosiers — one that 
would surely become a sinkhole 
for 
their 
championship 

aspirations.

2. Will Ty Isaac be given 

another chance to start?

Fifth-year 
senior 
running 

back 
Ty 
Isaac 
became 
a 

sacrificial lamb of sorts in the 
wake of the Michigan State 
loss.

On 
Michigan’s 
second 

possession, the ball went to 
freshman 
receiver 
Donovan 

Peoples-Jones 
and 
then 
to 

sophomore 
running 
back 

Chris Evans on the ground. 
Following their strategy of 
spreading the ball around, 

the Wolverines put the ball in 
Isaac’s hands next. At the very 
end of his run, the ball was 
poked out of Isaac’s grasp. He 
didn’t see the field again for 
the rest of the half.

After breaking out as one of 

the best offensive performers 
on the team over the first three 
weeks, Isaac fell on hard times 
as soon as the Big Ten season 
began. Against both Purdue and 
Michigan State, the starting job 
went to junior running back 
Karan Higdon.

Indiana 
found 
success 

stopping 
the 
run 
against 

Penn State, but doesn’t boast 
a particularly strong rushing 
defense — the Hoosiers are 
ranked 67th nationally with 
an 
average 
of 
152.4 
yards 

allowed per game. Saturday 
could provide an opportunity 
for Isaac to reclaim his carries. 
That is, if Michigan puts the 
ball back in his hands.

3. How long can the defense 

hold onto its top spot?

In possibly one of the biggest 

surprises of the 2017 season, 
the Wolverines have the No. 1 
defense in the nation despite 
losing all but one starter from 
last year.

Each opposing offense has 

offered a different look for the 
Wolverines to handle, and they 
have been able to neutralize 
them all. After installing the 
3-3-5 scheme earlier this year, 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown has his unit ready to 
face arguably any team in the 
country.

But even the defense’s best 

efforts may not be enough for 
Michigan if its offense can’t 
stop giving up possessions. 
The Wolverines’ offense has 
frequently put the defense in 
a hole with its sloppy play this 
year, which is a disconcerting 

trend, to say the least. When 
Michigan gave up its most 
points of the season — which 
was just 17 against Florida — 
the offense was to blame, as 
redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight threw back-to-
back pick-sixes.

And 
then 
against 
the 

Spartans, 
the 
Wolverines 

turned the ball over a whopping 
five times, and it cost them 
dearly. The defense can only 
save Michigan so many times.

4. Will Michigan overlook 

Indiana with Penn State a 
week away?

It isn’t that Indiana is a bad 

team; it’s that the Nittany Lions 
are serious contenders for the 
College Football Playoff, which 
is where the Wolverines hoped 
they would still be at this point 
in the season. 

But after Michigan’s loss 

to 
an 
unranked 
Michigan 

State, that dream seems all 
but crushed. The Hoosiers’ 0-2 
conference record, meanwhile, 
is understandable given that 
their two opponents were then-
No. 2 Ohio State and then-No. 4 
Penn State.

The next feasible scenario 

that would allow the Wolverines 
to sneak back into playoff 
contention would be to pull 
off an upset victory over the 
Nittany Lions in State College 
— a highly daunting proposition 
before even mentioning that 
it is set to be a whiteout game 
in primetime. As is often the 
case, though, that attractive 
possibility can cause a team 
to look past a less formidable 
opponent.

Michigan spent the week 

claiming 
that 
all 
of 
its 

preseason goals are still in 
front of it. If that is truly the 
case, the Wolverines now have 
no margin of error.

Breakdown: Wolverines will need defense to play hero again

There 
was 
a 
torrential 

downpour 
Saturday 
night, 

the 
Michigan 
football 
team 

turned the ball over five times 
— 
including 
three 
second-

half interceptions — and the 
Wolverines 
were 
upset 
by 

Michigan State, 14-10. You may 
have heard already.

Now, 
there’s 
no 
dancing 

around it: No. 17 Michigan (1-1 
Big Ten, 4-1 overall) will have 
to use the loss to the Spartans 
as motivation because, barring 
some help from around the Big 
Ten, the Wolverines can’t win 
the conference with another 
loss. They aren’t blind to that 
fact, as fifth-year senior center 
Patrick Kugler was quick to 
acknowledge 
Monday 
that 

Michigan will probably need 
to win out to accomplish their 
preseason goals.

The first step on that daunting 

path begins in Bloomington this 
Saturday.

The Wolverines will face 

Indiana (0-2, 3-2) with hopes 
of redemption, no matter how 
slight it may be. The Daily breaks 
down the matchup:

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Indiana pass defense

For 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback 
John 
O’Korn, 

his 
270-yard 
performance 

against Purdue may have been 
a deviation from the norm. 
O’Korn completed 16 of his 35 
attempts for 198 yards against 
the Spartans, and threw three 
interceptions to make matters 
worse. 
Make 
no 
mistake, 

weather played a factor last 
Saturday and O’Korn was the 
victim of some questionable play 
calling once the storm hit Ann 
Arbor.

But the Wolverines’ offensive 

line isn’t doing O’Korn any 
favors and the Hoosiers have 
enough talent to give Michigan 
trouble. Rashad Fant has proven 
he can be a shutdown corner, 
recording 22 pass break ups as 
a sophomore (second nationally) 
and notching another 17 last 
year (tied second nationally). 

His counterparts haven’t fared 
so well, allowing an average of 
298 yards against Ohio State, 
Virginia and Penn State.

Still, linebacker Tegray Scales 

is the star of a Tom Allen defense 
that isn’t afraid to blitz, and the 
Hoosiers could spend a lot of 
time threatening O’Korn given 
the state of the offensive line.

Overall, it’s hard to bet on this 

Wolverine offense right now.

Sophomore 
running 
back 

Chris Evans and sophomore 
left guard Ben Bredeson both 
said that Michigan has focused 
on reestablishing its run game 
in practice this week. If a back 
fumbled, he had to run a lap. If a 
back carried the ball too loosely, 
he had to sit out of practice for 
roughly 10 minutes.

And given that the Wolverines 

have fumbled eight times — 
losing six of them — through 
five games, that all makes sense. 
If Michigan shows a dedication 
to the run game and takes care 
of the ball better, it wouldn’t be 
surprising.

But there is also this to 

consider: when the Hoosiers 
faced Penn State on Sept. 30, 
running back Saquon Barkley 
managed just 56 yards on 20 
carries for an average of 2.8 
yards per carry.

Edge: Indiana

Indiana pass offense vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Like 
the 
Wolverines, 
the 

Hoosiers have themselves a 
new quarterback in redshirt 
freshman Peyton Ramsey, who 
led his team to a 27-0 win against 
FCS 
opponent 
Charleston 

Southern last week.

Ramsey fared well in his 

starting debut, completing 32 
of his 41 passes for 321 yards 
with two touchdowns and an 
interception while also rushing 
for 
54 
yards 
and 
another 

touchdown. 
Now, 
though, 

Ramsey is facing an entirely 
different challenge.

Michigan still boasts the top 

overall defense in the nation and 

the Wolverines’ secondary is 
allowing just 126 passing yards 
per game — good for second in 
the country.

Like 
Michigan 
State 

quarterback 
Brian 
Lewerke, 

Ramsey presents a threat both 
on the ground and in the air, 
but it’s difficult to imagine him 
besting this defense in his first 
Big Ten start.

Edge: Michigan

Indiana rush offense vs. 

Michigan rush defense

The Hoosiers average 3.6 

yards per rush. Michigan is 
holding opponents to 2.6 in the 
same category.

The Wolverines allowed only 

one first down in the second 
half against Michigan State, 
continuing their affinity for 
shutting down opponents late in 
games.

Defensive 
tackle 
Maurice 

Hurst 
is 
coming 
off 
a 

performance that featured 10 
total tackles (3.5 for loss). His 

supporting cast is more than 
formidable and if the past is any 
indication, the first half will be 
ugly and the second half will 
only get uglier.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams
This one could be the most 

competitive phase of the game.

Indiana’s Griffin Oakes is a 

perfect 5-for-5 on field goals this 
year, with his longest conversion 
coming from 51 yards. Wide 
receiver 
J-Shun 
Harris 
is 

averaging 22.8 yards per punt 
return with two touchdowns. 
And the Hoosiers are averaging 
18.4 yards per kick return.

Michigan, in its own right, 

has 
redshirt 
junior 
James 

Foug, redshirt freshman Quinn 
Nordin, and freshmen Donovan 
Peoples-Jones and Brad Robbins.

Since missing two field goals 

in the season opener against 
Florida, Nordin has been perfect. 
Foug has held the kickoff spot 
from the beginning, recording 

21 touchbacks in his 31 attempts. 
Since taking over as the starting 
punter, Robbins is averaging 41.6 
yards per punt. Peoples-Jones 
may fall behind Harris, as he 
averages just 12 yards per punt 
return, but he has returned one 
for a touchdown.

Edge: Push

Intangibles
The Wolverines are walking 

into a Homecoming matchup in 
Bloomington, but they do so with 
a point to prove. The Spartans 
left a sour taste in Michigan’s 
mouth for the second time in 
three years, and the Wolverines 
know they can’t afford another 
upset 
— 
especially 
with 

matchups at No. 7 Wisconsin 
and No. 3 Penn State left on the 
docket before a home conclusion 
against No. 9 Ohio State.

As Kugler put it Monday: 

“Everyone’s just got to sack up. 
It’s time to go.”

Edge: Michigan
Pick: Michigan 16, Indiana 3

Behind Enemy Lines: Indiana quarterback Richard Lagow

Coming 
off 
a 
career-best 

season in 2016, it’s safe to say that 
Richard Lagow has had a rocky 
senior year. 

The 
Indiana 
quarterback 

has completed just 56 percent 
of his passes for 661 yards with 
four 
touchdowns 
and 
three 

interceptions. Meanwhile, the 
Hoosiers rank just 69th in the 
nation in total offense after a 3-2 
start.

To top it all off, Lagow — who 

was named honorable mention 
All-Big Ten last year — lost his 
starting job to redshirt freshman 
Peyton Ramsey after a 45-14 loss 
to then-No. 4 Penn State.

But Lagow is well-versed when 

it comes to difficult situations.

After graduating from Plano 

High School in Texas, Lagow 
signed with Connecticut. He 
didn’t last long there — nor did 
he spend much time at Oklahoma 
State, his next stop.

The Daily spoke with Lagow 

at Big Ten Media Days in July 
about playing in former Michigan 
offensive 
coordinator 
Mike 

DeBord’s scheme this year, his 
long-winding journey to Indiana 
and facing Michigan’s top-ranked 
defense.

Q: 
The 
coaching 
change 

was made and (former Indiana 
head coach) Kevin Wilson was 
dismissed. How surprised were 
you? Were you prepared at all for 
that?

RL: No, it was very surprising. 

I actually found out about it — I 
was in class, and we got a text 
saying we had a team meeting 
later in the day. I’m sitting in class 
and the information got leaked 
to the media, and there’s a kid 
sitting next to me in class, and he 
taps me, he’s like, ‘What’s going 
on?’ ‘What are you talking about?’ 
He turns his phone and shows me 
the screen (saying), ‘Indiana head 
coach Kevin Wilson fired,’ and 
I’m like, ‘Whoa. You know more 
than I do, apparently!’ It was 
extremely surprising.

Q: What did you think of the 

reasons that were given for his 
dismissal?

RL: I’m not sure. I had 

never had anything but great 
experiences with Coach Wilson. 
He’s the coach that recruited 
me. I have a good relationship 
with him. A lot of the stuff 
that they talked about, I wasn’t 
even at the University for, I 
was (at) Cisco Junior College or 
something else.

TMD: What’s been the biggest 

adjustment, scheme-wise, going 
from the old style of offense to 
Coach DeBord this year?

RL: I think just the terminology 

is the biggest difference. You have 
to learn a whole new language, 
really, when it comes down to 
it. Everything is called different 
stuff. That’s the stuff you have to 
put the most work into.

TMD: What was your reaction 

to being named to the Johnny 
Unitas watch list this offseason?

RL: It’s a big honor. Anytime 

you can be associated with 
that name, and be on the same 
list as some of the other top 
quarterbacks in the country, it’s 
an honor, something that you 
don’t really take lightly, so it was 
cool.

TMD: You had a long road 

through 
this 
process. 
You 

started at Connecticut and then 
Oklahoma State. I guess, through 
all those stops, did you ever 
consider letting football go?

RL: I went to Cisco Junior 

College. That was my platform 
to get here. It’s a small town, 
with about 3,000 people — at 
most. That’s what they say on 
the internet. But there was times 
where I questioned why I was 
doing this. I was there for two 
seasons. After the first season I 
had some small offers, nowhere 
near what I wanted, so I decided 
to come back for my second 
year. And just throughout that 
time, there were a couple times 
where I would question it. But my 
teammates at Cisco — I wouldn’t 
have made it here without those 
guys, no doubt about that, so they 

kept my head straight.

TMD: What led you to Cisco in 

particular?

RL: No one else really wanted 

me. I was at UConn for like three 
weeks, I was barely there, and 
then I was at Oklahoma State 
because I just need somewhere 
to go, I had nowhere else to go. 
And by the time I was at Cisco, 
I had already transferred twice. 
Leaving Oklahoma State, a lot 
of the jucos were like, ‘You’ve 
already transferred twice, we 
haven’t seen you play since your 
senior year.’ Cisco gave me a 
chance. It worked out. Paid off 
for them. Paid off for me, as well. 
Crazy journey.

TMD: Now heading into your 

last year, looking back, is there 
anything you would change in 
retrospect?

RL: No, not a thing. I had a bad 

attitude when I was at UConn 
and Oklahoma State, really, so 

I guess that’s the only thing I 
would change. But I had to go 
through that time and mature to 
grow to get where I am now and 
be how I am now, so if I got to go 
through it again, I would do it 
the same way.

Q: How would you describe 

that attitude that you had?

RL: I wanted to play right 

away. I think every freshman 
needs to have that attitude — ‘Get 
me on the field right now.’ But 
you’ve got to have that attitude 
while also understanding that 
the people that are there before 
you, they know stuff that you 
don’t know. They might’ve played 
already, 
they 
might’ve 
been 

through a season, they know the 
system. So you’ve got to have 
the attitude of, ‘Put me in the 
game right now, I’m better than 
everyone else on this team,’ while 
also understanding that everyone 
else around you is there to help 

you and is there to help you grow 
as a player and a person and to 
teach you. That’s the thing that I 
needed to understand sooner, is 
that the people that were above 
me, I needed to look at them as an 
opportunity to learn, rather than 
the person that was keeping me 
from being on the field.

TMD: Looking back at last 

season, what was the most 
difficult 
part 
about 
playing 

Michigan’s defense?

RL: I think Michigan had a 

good pass rush last year. They had 
a really good defensive line. Their 
defensive line made it hard for us 
not only to run the ball, but made 
it hard for me to throw the ball 
at times. When you have some of 
those guys coming down on you, 
you don’t have a lot of time to 
throw the ball.

TMD: Statistically, they blitz 

on a high percentage of plays. 
How do you prepare for a team 

that likes to throw pressure at 
you?

RL: You’ve just got to be aware 

of that fact that they do like to 
bring 
pressure. 
When 
we’re 

getting ready for a game, we know 
when they like to bring pressure, 
on what down, on what distance, 
against what formation. So they’ll 
surprise you, but a lot of the times 
you’re expecting it, so you’ve got 
to be aware on the field and ready 
to react.

TMD: 
Do 
you 
have 
any 

impressions 
of 
this 
year’s 

Michigan team at all?

RL: I don’t, I don’t. It’s a whole 

new year.

Q: 
What 
do 
you 
think, 

though, when you hear the name 
Michigan when you see them on 
the schedule? What’s the first 
thing you think about Michigan 
football?

RL: 
Tradition. 
A 
lot 
of 

tradition.

Fifth-year senior quarterback Richard Lagow had a rocky start to the 2017 season, throwing three interceptions before losing his job to Peyton Ramsey last week.

Roos’ winding path leads to perfect fit with Wolverines

If everything had gone as 

originally planned, Alex Roos 
would have already finished 
his senior season of college 
hockey. Instead, he’s spending 
his last year of eligibility over 
1,000 miles away from where he 
started.

As a freshman forward at 

Colorado College, Roos was a 
key contributor, ranking second 
on the team with 10 goals. 
But before Roos’ sophomore 
season, the Tigers hired a new 
head coach, Mike Haviland. As 
Haviland remade the program 
with his own recruits, Roos’ 
playing time dwindled, and he 
scored just five goals combined 
during his sophomore and junior 
seasons.

“By the time my senior season 

came along, the coaches had 
decided to go in a different 
direction with the team and 

didn’t see me fitting into their 
plans,” Roos said. “I figured it 
would be best for me and the 
team that I pursue another 
opportunity.”

So Roos spent last spring 

in the classroom instead of on 
the ice, focusing on earning 
his economics degree. But by 
no means was he done with 
hockey.

“I took maybe a couple days 

off to kind of figure everything 
out,” Roos said. “(Then I) got 
right back into the gym and 
made sure I was staying in shape, 
skating, working on my skills. 
Really made sure that I used that 
time to not only stay in shape, but 
to get even better.”

Having 
graduated 
from 

Colorado College, Roos was 
free to play his final season 
as a graduate transfer for any 
program 
he 
chose 
without 

having to sit out a year. He 
settled on Michigan, where he 
had visited while in high school 

and was familiar with several 
members of the coaching staff 
— including current head coach 
Mel Pearson, who was then an 
assistant under Red Berenson.

It wasn’t only the prestige 

of Michigan’s hockey program 
that brought Roos to Ann Arbor, 
though — part of the appeal 
was his desire to earn a masters 
degree.

“Obviously knowing some of 

the staff here helped just with 
familiarity — them knowing 
me, me knowing them,” Roos 
said. “Also the school itself — I 
wanted to pursue my masters 
degree at the business school, so 
getting into that program was a 
large part of it as well. And then 
just being a part of this tradition 
of being a Michigan Wolverine 
was something that I was really 
interested in, really excited me.”

The youth of the Wolverines’ 

roster also attracted Roos, as he 
saw an opportunity to contribute 
veteran leadership to the group. 

Pearson himself describes Roos 
as a “really good person” who 
“communicates well.” However, 
Roos has tried to balance his role 
of elder statesman with that of 
being a newcomer to the team.

“Being a new guy but also 

having experience, I haven’t 
really 
tried 
to 
force 
my 

knowledge on any guys,” Roos 
said. “Just kind of letting them 
know that if they ever need 
help or have any questions, I’m 
here. Hopefully show them by 
example by leading the way on 
the ice and showing the proper 
way to play. Just anything I can 
do to help.”

Despite 
this 
expertise 
on 

and off the ice, Roos has had to 
deal with his own share of new 
experiences. This includes the 
drastic change in environment 
from Colorado College — a liberal 
arts school with an enrollment of 
just over 2,000 — to Michigan, 
a university nearly 20 times as 
large, and having to fit in as a 

graduate student without an 
incoming class.

According 
to 
Roos, 
his 

teammates 
have 
made 
this 

transition as smooth as possible.

“The guys have been more 

than inviting and welcomed 
me with open arms, so that 
was really nice,” Roos said. 
“Just the overall feel of being 
in a bigger town, bigger school 
was definitely a little bit of a 
culture shock, but I feel like 
I’m adjusting well and really 
enjoying myself.”

Roos certainly does appear 

to be enjoying himself on the 
ice. He got started on the right 
foot in his first game with the 
Wolverines, scoring a goal and 
adding an assist in an exhibition 
victory over Western Ontario, 
and also found the net in 
Michigan’s official season opener 
at St. Lawrence last weekend.

“It had been a while since I’d 

scored a goal,” Roos said. “But it 
was definitely exciting and nice 

to get one in the first game and 
get that feeling and adrenaline 
rush of scoring.”

The Wolverines’ youth and 

difficulties scoring were both 
well-documented last season. 
And while Roos might not be able 
to fix these problems by himself, 
he’s given Michigan just what it 
needs in both of those areas.

“You 
have 
to 
earn 
your 

experience,” Pearson said. “You 
can’t win it in a lottery. Someone 
just can’t bang their magic wand 
and give you experience — you 
have to acquire it. I think that 
really helps when you’re dealing 
with younger people and being 
able to help them go through 
some of the things he did.

“He just adds to that senior 

class because he’s been through 
it. He’s spent four years in college 
already so he understands the 
ups and downs, the grind of 
college and the academic balance 
with the athletic balance. He’s a 
great addition.”
