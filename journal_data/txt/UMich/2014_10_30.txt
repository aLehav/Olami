Students call for changes

After Proposal
2, administration
explores options to
reach diversity goals
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Minority enrollment at the
University has shifted dramati-
cally in the past decade, fol-
lowing two court cases over
the University's race-conscious
admission policies and a suc-
cessful statewide referendum
that banned the consideration of
race in a public higher education
admissions decisions.
This summer, the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the con-
stitutionality of The Michigan
Civil Rights Initiative, more com-
monly referred to as Proposal 2.
The 2006 popular referendum
banned the consideration of race,
among other factors, in college
admissions - rendering the final

word on affirmative action in the
state of Michigan.
The Supreme Court decision
does not necessarily signal any-
thing new for the University.
Since the ban was passed in 2006i,
the institution has admitted stu-
dents without an affirmative
action policy in place. At least
since the 1970s, and as recently as
last year's BBUM protests led by
the Black Student Union, activ-
ists and student protesters have
set a goal of having Blacks con-
stitute 10 percent of the student
population, a threshold that has
never been reached.
But now that the last glim-
mer of hope for a restoration of
affirmative action has faded, it
commits the University to a dif-
ficult situation - a time in which
minority representation is at one
of the lowest points and renewed
protests are demanding it climb
up to a goal higher than ever
before.

ELECTION 2014
In Senate race,
Land struggles
* with narrative

Despite fundraising
advantage, prospects
grim for GOP
candidate
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
As the Nov. 4 election
approaches, Republican U.S. Sen-
ate candidate Terri Lynn Land
has become more difficult to
define.
She's bringing in significant
amounts of money - her cam-
paign raised a total of $11 mil-
lion in contributions as of the last
quarter, more than her Demo-
cratic challenger - and she's not
short on airtime, running mul-
tiple ads in the lead-up to elec-
tions. This week, she concluded
an expansive bus tour of the
state, covering 3,181 miles over
the course of three months.
That strong showing in
resources, however, is juxta-
posed with some less-than-favor-
able numbers. By the most recent
polls, Land trails her Democratic
opponent, U.S. Rep. Gary Peters,

by an average of 11.4 points. And
she's only garnered one major
media endorsement, from Crain's
Detroit Business.
At the start of campaign sea-
son, Land's chances of succeed-
ing longtime U.S. Senator Carl
Levin looked favorable -- a for-
mer Secretary of State who ran
two successful statewide cam-
paigns for the position in 2002
and 2006, beating her opposi-
tion by more than 10 percentage
points each time.
In the Senate race, early pols
had her doing well. The seat,
the first open in Michigan in 20
years, was highlighted by Repub-
licans in their effort to flip con-
trol of the U.S. Senate in their
favor.
"Terri's got a great record,"
said GOP consultant Stu Sandler,
president of Decider Strategies.
"If you look at her record as Sec-
retary of State, she ran a state-
wide office for eight years and did
so with extraordinary success,
and it's one of the reasons, if you
look today that Crain's endorsed
her, it's one of the reasons why."
But from the start, her cam-
paign has been unable to escape

Mayoral candidate

By JACK TURMAN
Daily StaffReporter
City Councilmember Chris
Taylor (D-Ward 3), the Democrat-
ic mayoral candidate, discussed
taking a balanced approach to
city issues if elected. However,
Taylor has repeatedly highlight-
ed the importance of downtown
Ann Arbor in both the first post-
primary debate Oct. 7 and in an
interview with the Daily Oct. 16.
Taylor said the downtown area
needs to be a vibrant place where
people can work and live com-
fortably, while still maintaining a
focus on other issues.
"It also has to have a character
and finding that balance is going
to be what we are trying to do
here," Taylor said.
For downtown Ann Arbor to pre-
serve this character, Taylor plans
on working closely with the Down-
town Development Authority.
"I think the DDA has done great
work for the downtown (area) and

Experts weigh in on
ISIS threat, ideology

Tobacco whistleblower
talks cigarette policies

Diverse panel
provides context to
evolving conflict
By GENEVIEVE HUMMER
Daily StaffReporter
Despite a summer of increas-
ing fear concerning the spread
of the terror group ISIS in the
Middle East, some University
professors argue the global
threat might be relatively mini-
mal in the long term.
The International Policy
Center and the Center for Mid-
dle Eastern and North African
Studies co-sponsored Wednes-
day's event at the Ford School of
Public Policy, "Understanding
ISIS: Evolution, ideology, and
implications," which discussed
the origins, ideology, popular
support for and international
impact of ISIS.
H-S

ISIS, short for the Islamic
State in Iraq and Syria, is a
Sunni Muslim extremist group
that has drawn increasing inter-
national attention in the last few
months. In June of this year, the
group seized control of terri-
tory in northeastern Syria and
western Iraq, including Iraq's
second-largest city, Mosul. In
the same month, ISIS declared
the creation of a caliphate in the
conquered regions of Iraq and
Syria and named Abu Bakr al-
Baghdadi as caliph.
The media's growing fascina-
tion with the extremist group is
one factor that prompted Social
Work student Angela Joo to
attend the event.
"ISIS has been covered in the
media a lot so I was interested in
learning more about it as a citi-
zen, and I just wanted to know
what the issues were and how
the federal government planned
on taking care of the problem,"
5-m

Joo said.
To address the many fac-
ets of ISIS, the event featured
four panelists, each focusing
on a different aspect of the
issue: History Prof. Juan Cole,
Political Science Prof. Mark
Tessler, Political Science Prof.
James Morrow, and Moham-
mad Khalil, associate professor
of religious studies at Michigan
State University.
In Cole's talk, he said the
Iraqi transition from a socialist
to a neo-liberal government fol-
lowing the U.S. invasion of Iraq
in 2003 prompted Sunni dis-
content. The new government
placed the Shiite elite in power
and marginalized Sunnis, he
added.
"These were the capable
people in Iraq, they were the
equivalent of West Point gradu-
ates and Harvard Law and high
politicians and the people who
managed things," Cole said.
"And they were all told you're
now unemployed, if you behave
yourself you might be able to
get a job as a shoe-shiner to the
Shiites, and so they went into
rebellion."
Tessler presented findings
from surveys he and ateam con-
ducted in Iraq in 2004, 2006,
2011 and 2013, the results of
which were consistent with
many of Cole's assertions. Tes-
sler and his team also noted
growing Sunni discontent dur-
ing the U.S. occupation of Iraq.
One important shift that
the surveys reflected was a
shift from Iraqi national iden-
tity among citizens in the early
years of the U.S. occupation, to
more sectarian identities among
Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds in
2011 and 2013. The surveys
also indicated that, with time,
Sunni interest in an intersection
between Islam and political life
increased substantially.

Jerry Wigand, the former vice
president for research and devel-
opment of Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corporation, caused
significant public outrage when
he exposed the company's inten-
tional attempt to increase the
carcinogenic and addictive com-
ponents in its cigarettes. Since
then, he's traveled the world just
to talk about it.
Wigand spoke at the School of
Public Health Wednesday after-
noon to a crowd of about 100
people, discussing the potential
public health impact and contro-
versy surrounding e-cigarettes,
the science behind
tobacco engineer-
ing that promotes
addiction and the «JV
current state of the
tobacco industry in to U]
the United States.
Wigand lost his obli
job at Brown &
Williamson and the
received numer-
ous death threats to av
after disclosing the
company's secrets.
After his dismiss-
al, he assisted the
U.S. Federal Drug
Association with their investi-
gation of Brown & Williamson.
He became nationally known as
a tobacco whistleblower after
revealing that the company had
altered the tobacco content in its
cigarettes on the CBS news pro-
gram "60 Minutes." This expose
inspired the 1999 movie, "The
Insider."
In 1995, Wigand reached
international prominence when
he became the tobacco industry's
highest-ranking former execu-
tive to address public health and
smoking issues. Under incredible
pressure himself, with even his
wife and family members also
receiving threats of violence, he
informed the public about the
industry's poor health and safety

practices.
When discussing his decision
to go public with Brown & Wil-
liamson's fraudulent practices
Wednesday, Wigand stressed the
importance of reacting ethically.
"It's a gradual evolution to
understand what moral obliga-
tions one has with the knowl-
edge they have and to avoid that
culpability by being a bystander,"
he said. "A bystander is someone
who watches on and does noth-
ing about it. I had to do some-
thing about it."
Wigand recounted how after
he went public, Brown & Wil-
liamson filed a lawsuit against
him because of his public disclo-
sures about the industry's effort-
s a gradual evoluti
nderstand what m
igations one has w
knowledge they ho
void that culpabilit3
being a bystander"
to diminish the health and safety
issues with tobacco use. The law-
suit was dismissed as a condition
in the historic 1996 settlement
agreement between the U.S.
Attorney General and the tobac-
co industry.
Currently, Wigand spends
his time in lectures around the
world advocating for employ-
ees of morally corrupt compa-
nies to not stand by idly. He is
still active in ligations in the
tobacco industry and is works as
consultant on tobacco. He also
leads a non-profit organization
for kids, Smoke-Free Kids Inc.,
with which he concentrates his
energy educating kids about the
tobacco industry.
When asked if he would blow

the whistle again, Wigand said
his involvement in the process
was simply planting the seed of
change and that he was generally
proud of his actions.
"Never did I expect that there
would be success or the belief
that it would really make a dif-
ference," he said. "The media, my
students, my family, law enforce-
ment, justice department - they
all made it happen. I was just this
substantial catalyst."
The event drew a wide variety
of attendees, ranging from cur-
rent students to international
tobacco experts.
Pharmacy student Brad Vin-
cent was inspired to attend the
lecture after he watched "The
Insider."
"I'm in the health
and tobacco class
and we watched the
on movie, 'The Insider'
oral last week and it was
a great movie, we
ith learned a lot about
tobacco and the
ave whole process. I was
born in the early
y by '90s so I never got
to know what hap-
pened," Pittson said.
LSA senior Emily
Long said she found
the lecture particu-
larly relevant to her field of study.
"I am actually writing a senior
thesis on electronic cigarettes so
I thought this would be a really
interesting piece to come here
and learn about someone who
has a lot more expertise than I
have," Long said.
Jose Monzon, a tobacco
researcher from Guatemala,
found the lecture to be helpful
from an international perspec-
tive.
"He's a big figure in the tobac-
co world. I'm interested to learn
about the current trends in how
tobacco control is affecting pop-
ulations nowadays and particu-
larly how to reduce tobacco use
in low and middle income coun-
tries, such as Guatemala."

SENATE
From Page 1A
concerns of poor management,
some coming from within her
own party. She's faced criti-
cisms both about her policies,
which have been seen as out-of-
touch with the state, and about
her interactions with the public
and the media, which have been
characterized as limited and
awkward.
Earlier this month, the Nation-
al Republican Senatorial Com-
mittee, a major group working to
fund the GOP push for the Sen-
ate, pulled funding for advertise-
ments for Land, concentrating
instead on races in other states.
Both the Land campaign and the
NRSC said at the time that the
funding was pulled because Land
had resources from other groups.
Neither responded to requests
for comment about potential
reinvestment in the race by the
NRSC.
Sandler said it seems like a
narrative has been constructed
around Land, one he said hasn't
done her justice.
"I think the criticism has been
unfair," he said. "Terri has done
a variety of public appearances,
she's done a variety of media
appearances. For some reason, a
narrative started about her being
less willing to be in public, which
I thinkisa falsenarrative. Ithink
it's unfair, because I think she's
been out quite a bit."
This narrative can also be
defined by Land's policy deci-
sions, Political Science Prof. Vin-
cent Hutchings said. He pointed
to issues that have been promi-
nent in political messaging dur-
ing the campaign such as pay
equity, climate change and affili-
DDA

I look forward continuing with
it," Taylor said.
DDA Executive Director
Susan Pollay said she looks for-
ward to building downtown and
ensuring the high quality of life
that is associated with down-
townAsn Arbor.
"As we have with the previ-
ous mayors, the DDA will strive
to find projects and initiatives
* that serve its mission, which is
to strengthen downtown and
encourage private investment
that also serve the city admin-
istrator, mayor and city council
goals," Pollay said in an e-mail
interview. "We all are working
toward community prosperity
and quality of life."
Taylor said the DDA is cur-
rently working on long term
transportation issues, one of

ation with the Koch brothers - a
pair of Republican billionaires
tied to the more hardline side of
the party - as having the most
impact on how Land is viewed.
Though Land has fired back on
those messages in several ways,
namely emphasizing her cam-
paign message that she's a mom,
and moms "get things done,"
Hutchings said the narrative is
prominent because there's some
truth to many of the issues pre-
sented.
"I haven't seen any accusa-
tionsthat appeartobewhollyoff-
base," he said. "Now, there's a lot
more going on as well of course
- Land hasa whole range of dif-
ferent characteristics. She can't
be reduced to those in particular.
But the pointcissthatcthey're quali-
ties that are associated with that
candidate."
The Land campaign did not
return requests for comment.
This has been the most expen-
sive Senate race in Michigan's
history - more than $50 million
has been spent on either Land
or Peters' behalf thus far, most
coming from contributors out-
side of the state. Over the past
few election cycles in Michigan,
Democrats have typically been
more successful for federal posi-
tions, making winning roles like
U.S. Senator an uphill battle for
Republicans.
Ultimately, Hutchings said,
instead of an external factor
that's causing Land to perform
poorly, the negativity that's fol-
lowed Land throughout the cam-

of her poor showing in the polls.
"I don't think that the candi-
date is doing poorly because of
a poor public image," he said. "I
think that the candidate has a
poor public image because she is

the DDA requests city assis-
tance on downtown matters
and has to receive city approval
of development and financing
plans, Taylor said he doesn't
want to overstep boundaries
and exert too much influence on
the DDA.
"The DDA takes a pretty
careful approach to the issues
that it tackles," Taylor said. "I
don't want to get in the way of
that."
"It is a weak mayor admin-
istrative system," he added.
"The DDA is a separate entity,
which has budget review from
City Council, but makes its own
decisions."
The free decision-making
process has led to concerns,
often raised by Councilman

parency with the DDA.

ENROLLMENT
From Page 1A
process of bringing any student
to the University of Michigan:
outreach, admittance and conver-
sion, a term used to describe the
process of convincing admitted
students to enroll.
William Collins, executive
director of the University's Cen-
ter for Educational Outreach,
said when it comes to increas-
ing minority enrollment without
affirmative action, each of those
steps presents unique challenges.
He said University officials have
grown more cognizant of those
challenges in the years since Pro-
posal 2.
"It's not simply a matter of 'can
you get people to apply?' although
that's an issue," Collins said. "It's
not simply a matter of admit-
ting (people), although that's an
issue. So when you look at it as a
constellation of issues here, from
aspirations to preparation to
application to admission to con-
version to matriculation, those
are the things that I think there is
a growing awareness of"
In 1996, Black students made
up nearly nine percent of the stu-
dent body, the highest it has ever
been. By 2006, right before Pro-
posali2 came into play, that num-
ber had already dropped slightly,
to 7.2 percent. The federal guide-
lines for measuringrace changed
in 2010, so the numbers aren't
entirely comparable, but over the
next eight years, the percentages
began a slow and steady decline
to an even lower point. Accord-
ing to figures released last week
by the Office of the Registrar,
Black enrollment stands at 4.63
percent of the undergraduate
population. When that number
also includes a breakdown of stu-
dents who identify as more than
one race, as is in data compiled

by the Office of Budget and Plan-
ning, that figure stands at 5.8
percent. On this year's freshman
class alone, the number is sig-
nificantly lower for Black enroll-
ment - 3.84 percent.
In contrast, roughly 19 percent
of Michigan's college-aged popu-
lation is Black.
During last year's BBUM
protest, students cited a host of
ways low minority enrollment
impacted their experiences at
the University, including facing
harmful stereotypes and repeat-
ed instances of microaggressions.
The protest went viral on Twit-
ter, resonating with students in
schools across the country.
LSA senior Arnold Reed, BSU
president, said the low numbers
aren't always visible from a dis-
tance, but their impact becomes
evident once students arrive on
campus.
"Coming for a huge football
game, you're going to see a huge
diverse crowd of people," he said.
"It really actually kind of hit me
when I was here, how big of an
issue it was."
At the University, the first
efforts after Proposal 2 passed
in 2006 were centered largely
around outreach and recruitment,
focusing on building pipelines
from underserved communi-
ties to the University, following
the recommendations of a 2007
Diversity Blueprints committee.
When it comes to measuring
the long-term outcomes of these
programs, there are anecdotal
stories of success but not much
concrete data as of yet.
"It's a complicated issue, and
an easy, direct yes or no type of
answer is probably not appro-
priate," he said. "We have lots of
recruitment efforts underway
- our admissions staff does an
excellent job in getting out to high
schools, summer programs, we
do reach students in high schools,

try to cultivate interest in going
to college and so forth. At the
same time, what We know is that
many first generation, low income
students, or underrepresented
minority students, who perform
well in high school apply to no
college whatsoever."
Ongoing initiatives
As Michigan's affirmative
action ban moved from district
court, to state court, to a six-
month wait before the Supreme
Court, and also amid renewed
student protests such as BBUM,
the University broadened its
efforts in the two other steps of
the admissions process - admit-
tance and conversion - and
beyond into addressing the cli-
mate on campus.
Last spring, the University's
Board of Regents appointed two
new administrators - Robert
Sellers, vice provost for diver-
sity, equity and inclusion Kedra
Ishop, associate vice president for
enrollment management.
In an e-mail interview in early
October, Sellers pointed to sev-
eral factors as representative of
the diversity, equity and inclusiv-
ity in his job title, including both
recruitment and retention not
only of students, but also staff
and faculty, along with improving
their campus experience.
Earlier thisyear, Sellers chaired
the newly formed Provost's Com-
mittee on Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion, which released a report
in May. The committee was struc-
tured to continue the work start-
ed by the original 2007 Blueprints
on Diversity task force, which
spawned the CEO, among other
initiatives.
Beyond the numbers
Since the release of the latest
enrollment data, the University's
Black enrollment still currently
hovers around 5 percent, capping

off a decade-plus longslide in per-
centage.
However, many of the Uni-
versity's initiatives are long term
with impacts that won't be visible
for multiple year, Sellers, Ishop
and Collins all pointed out, espe-
cially those launched during the
last school year and even those
started back in 2006-2008.
Whether they'll be able to fix
the problem eventually is unclear,
especially when it comes to the
BSU's goal of 10 percent - a man-
date that technically, under Pro-
posal 2, the University is unable
to directly aim for, because it con-
stitutes a quota.
"Could itchappenYes, itcould,"
Collins said of achieving 10 per-
cent. "But I think that means
working closely with some school
districts. I think it may mean the
admissions office giving a broader
look at characteristics that stu-
dents bring with them. I'm not
saying they don't do that now, but
such things such as your leader-
ship- we're the leaders and best,
so one could theoretically saythat
ifyouwere presidentofyour class,
we could give you some extra con-
sideration."
For now, though, the low num-
bers still matter, even if the Uni-
versity is working to changethem.
Reed said in talkingto a potential
student about attending the Univer-
sity, given his experience on cam-
pus, he would highlight two things
- both that the numbers have a
presence, but also that there's alot
the University has to offer.
"The statistics - you can't real-
ly fight numbers," Reed said. "It's
real. It's a real thing, and you will
feel it. I would definitely never
sugarcoat that. I feel like that's
also part of what makes our expe-
rience unique. I would also tell
that student that if you do choose
to come here, there are a lot of
things that the University does
have at your disposal."


REGENT
From Page 1A
George W. Bush appointed Weiser
as Ambassador to the Slovak
Republic for four years. During
his time, he organized three inter-
national investment conferences
for the country and coordinated
American support for the restora-
tion of the medieval Trencin Cas-
tle.
His diplomatic service inspired
him to create the Ronald and
Eileen Weiser Center for Europe
and Eurasia and the Weiser Cen-
ter for Emerging Democracies at
the University.
The former ambassador has
also been an active member of the
Republican Party, serving as the
Chair of the Michigan Republican
Party in 2009 and the National

Finance Chair of the Republican
National Committee in 2011.
Weiser intends to bring his
wide array of skill sets to the
Board on a platform of keeping
tuition low and strengthening the
University's satellite campuses in
Flint and Dearborn.
"I've got political background,
diplomatic background, busi-
ness background, financial back-
ground - that is different and
unique compared to the current
regents we have," he said.
Weiser said the University's
current budgeting method does
not incentivize savings and
does not allow budgets from one
area to be moved to other, more
constrained areas. He plans to
change the way the University
budgets funds as a method for
bringing down tuition. He also
plans to provide prospective stu-

dents with a clear understanding
of what their tuition will be over
the entirety of their undergradu-
ate career.
In addition, Weiser said he
understands the importance of
the University's satellite campus-
es for lower-income, part-time
working students, as the cost of,
living in Flint and Dearborn is
much less expensive than in Ann
Arbor.
He plans on developing classes
and programs at the Flint and
Dearborn campuses at the same
educational standard as in Ann
Arbor through increasing online
learning and requesting Ann
Arbor professors commute to the
other campuses.
"It's not difficult - assuming
there's the demand for courses
that are offered here that are not
offered in those campuses - for

professors or whoever is teaching
to puta section into those schools
and give them the same opportu-
nity," he said.
Weiser also said he recognizes
the importance of a diverse stu-
dent body to the overall educa-
tional atmosphere.
Lastschoolyear,manystudents,
expressed discontent with the
lack of diversity at the University,
most notably through the Black
Student Union's viral #BBUM
Twitter campaign that garnered
national attention. Weiser said he
plans to increase diversity in part
by lowering tuition. .
"There's all kinds of diversi-
ties that I think are important to
give everybody the opportunity
to have the broadest interaction
and to have the best ability to
work and live in the world that we
have," he said.


PROTEST
From Page 1A
University spokesperson Rick
Fitzgerald said the University
offers a variety of effective pro-
grams and that it is continually
looking for ways to improve how
it responds to and prevents sexual
assault.
"There are lots of programs, and
in fact, the University of Michigan
is often looked to as a leader in this
area among other higher institu-
tions," Fitzgerald said. "I think the
most effective thing we can do is to
engage the students who are pas-
sionate about this topic, to engage
in conversation and work through
these issues."
The anonymous list of demands
presented on the Diag and pub-
lished in The Michigan Daily may
be in conjunction with the Carry
That Weight day of action. Women
carrying mattresses walked
through campus, stopping in the
Diag in front of the list of demands
to display their mattresses, marked
with the Twitter hashtag #car-
rythatweight. Other college
campuses, including Stanford Uni-
versity and Harvard University,
participated in similar protests and
calls to action.
LSA junior Fabiana Diaz said
she hopes to use her own experi-
ences through this event to offer
support to other survivors.
"I'm a survivor of sexual assault,
so this is very personal for me,"
Diaz said. "This is a day to show
solidarity and be symbolic of the
weight that all women carry as
a result of sexual assault. As a
woman, even if you aren't directly
involved in sexual assault, you still
carry that burden. Our goal really
is to get even one person to just
Google it."

The Carry That Weight event
at the University is officially spon-
sored by the Feminist Forum,
but student volunteers at SAPAC
actively participated and orga-
nized volunteers for the event.
"It's not just SAPAC, but we did
want to show our support for this
event," Gillies said. "It's not just to
raise awareness, but it's to show
support for survivors. There are a
lot of survivors on campus and you
can feel very alone, so this is our
way of saying we support you."
An analysis done by the Wash-
ington Post in July found that
the University ranks second in
number of reported instances of
sexual assault. Though the direc-
tor of SAPAC interpreted this data
as showing their sexual assault
awareness programs to be effec-
tive in encouraging individuals to
report misconduct instances, the
anonymous group making these
demands believes SAPAC and its
resources are not enough.
LSA freshman Kate Heinz, who
noticed the installments while
walking to class, said she knows
sexual assault happens on campus,
but that statistics of how often sex-
ual assault occurs are still shock-
ing.
"Everyone knows it's a big thing
on college campuses but it's hard to
really see," Heinz said. "You would
never know that the University is
second in the nation for reported
assaults. It's hard to gauge, so it's
just a matter of understanding the
scope of it and bridging the gap
between reports and actual hap-
penings. It's a matter of communi-
cation between the administration
and students."
LSA junior Kathleen Abenes,
a Resident Adviser, said existing
initiatives are not sufficient for
incomingstudents.
"I know we have the AlcoholE-

du program but why don't we have
something just as serious for sexual
assault? I know that there is Rela-
tionship Remix and the Change it
Up initiative going on, and I know
that they swipe MCards, but as an
RA there is no way for me to make
sure they go," she said. "There are
no consequences for not going to
these workshops."
The AlchoholEdu initiative, an
online program that addresses the
use of alcohol and other substanc-
es on campus and is required for
all incoming students, discusses
sexual assault in the context of a
person's ability to give consent and
discusses the sexual assaults that
occur while under the influence of
alcohol. LSA senior Stephen Gold-
enthal said sexual assault isn't just,
a result of alcohol consumption or
attending Greek life events.
"You hear of things on cam-
pus, I know people who have been
sexually assaulted, so it just really
changes your perspective," Gold-
enthal said. "I think that the people
committing sexual assault might
not even see their actions as being
sexual assault. And it doesn't just
occur at parties or when you are
under the influence, it's an entire
cultural issue."
The second demand calls for all
fraternity, sorority and coopera-
tive houses to put up asign defining
consent in common areas, similar
to signs prohibiting anyone under
the age of 21 from consuming alco-
hol.
Furthermore, the list demands
that athletes be held to the same
sexual conduct standards as non-
athletes. This demand appears to
be related to the University's han-
dling of sexual assault allegations
on campus following student and
legal scrutiny surrounding the
"permanent separation" of Bren-
dan Gibbons, the Michigan football

team's former starting kicker, for
violating the Student Sexual Mis-
conduct Policy. His removal came
nearly four years after the incident
of assault, which is reported to
have occurred Nov. 22, 2009, dur-
ing Gibbons' freshman year at the
University.
One month after the incident
was brought to light, Central
Student Government formed an
executive task force aimed at inves-
tigating Gibbons' sexual miscon-
duct case, ultimately finding the
University's administration and
athletic department responsible
for failing to investigate the Gib-
bons case in a timely, transparent
manner.
Fitzgerald said the University's
policy already aligns with this
demand and affirms the equal
treatment of athletes and non-ath-
letes.
"Athletes are treated exactly
the same as every other student,"
Fitzgerald said. "There is no sepa-
rate process when it comes to sex-
ual misconduct as the new policy
makes clear."
The fourth demand calls into
question the education of Universi-
ty staff and DPS in issues of sexual
assault response, stating that cur-
rent training is surface level and
insufficient.
The list of demands goes on to
call for providing survivors of sex-
ual violence the option to have the
responsible party expelled from
the University.
The demands also ask that sup-
port be increased for survivors
of sexual violence beyond the
resources offered through SAPAC.
This would include an increase in
widely-known, immediate coun-
seling services and would require
that the parties found respon-
sible for an act of sexual assault be
restrained from interacting with

the survivor in his or her personal and limited resources, so we do the
community. best with what we have," Gillies
LSA sophomore Meredith Gil- said. "We still have a lot we could

Profiting off students
For-profit colleges yield high student debt and low graduation rates
Jn the past decade student debt has nearly tripled, rising
to an alarming $1.2 trillion. A disproportionately high
percentage of this debt is owed by students at for-profit
universities, which specifically market their education as a
product to targeted students while also often charging more
in tuition fees than comparable community college programs.
It is imperative that Gov. Rick Snyder and the Michigan State
Legislature work together to swiftly regulate the for-profit
college education industry as part of a strategic policy for
reducing student debt overall.

According to a 2012 report by the United
States Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee, 96 percent of for-profit
university students hold education-related
debt, compared with 48 and 57 percent of
students at public and private nonprofit
colleges, respectively. Further, 22 percent of
students at for-profit schools will default on a
loan payment within the first three years, as
compared with about 9 percent of students at a
nonprofit college.
For-profit institutions, as the name implies,
operate as businesses - some even with
shareholders and a corporate organizational
structure - that sell education as a product.
With the incentive to earn a profit, they must
findwaystoattractstudentstoenroll.For-profit
schools spend about 22.7 percent of their total
revenue on sales and marketing. The University
of Phoenix alone spends about $400,000 a day
on advertising. Other institutions like DeVry
and ITT Tech are among the largestadvertisers
on Google.
Some of these unsavory business practices
by for-profit institutions of higher education
have also precipitated government legal action.
Last year, California's attorney general took a
large for-profit chain to court for fabricating
statistics, creating false advertising and
engaging in other deceptive practices to lure
minority or low-income residents to their
schools. In February, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau sued ITT Educational
Services,Inc.,for predatorylendingto students.
Acceptance rates are comparatively high
and tuition is about twice that of non-profit
institutions.Meanwhile,only about31.5 percent
of students in for-profit schools graduated

compare to 57 percent for public nonprofits and
66 percent for private nonprofits, according
to a 2014 article. The University of Phoenix,
which has a location in Ann Arbor, graduates
only 16 percent of its students through campus
learning, and only 4 percent of its students
who take courses online, according to a 2013
article. For those who do manage to graduate,
students are less likely to receive callbacks
from employers. This evidences that students
are paying a high cost for a low return on their
investment.
Advertisements for for-profit schools boast
their accelerated learning, online options and
job placement records. They claim to offer to
students what they may think is not available
to them through traditional schooling, like
targeted curricula, specific or technical job
training, accelerated degrees or optimal return
on investment. Likewise, prospective students
may choose for-profit schools because they
may initially appear less expensive than a
traditional college. However, these students
may be unaware that nonprofit schools often
offer scholarships and grants to cover some,
sometimes even all, of the costs for qualifying
students. In planning for their educational
futures, students should consider a wide variety
of schools.
But this problem extends far beyond
individual decision-making. Systematic changes
and regulation of for-profit schools need to be
implemented to curb predatory practices. It
is important that the state takes seriously the

es. This social media-based chal-
lenge required students to respond
to the challenge prompts via Sweet-
land's Facebook page as a comment
on the desired challenge, or tweet a
response with the hashtag #Sweet-
landNDOW. The number of likes,
favorites or retweets determined
the winner of each challenge. When
reading through the prompts I con-
templated whether or not I want-
ed to complete all or just a few of
the challenges.
Challenge one: "If I were to teach
academic OR creative writing at
U-M I would --." I didn't know
where to begin with this prompt
and never had the desire to instruct
a class, so I pushed this challenge
to the side and considered the
next one. "Write a limerick about
writing." My initial thought was
this sounds fun, but the thought
that followed was I hate writing
poetry. Since limericks have a strict
format - AABBA rhyme scheme -
I decided to give my poetry writing
a try. This task quickly lost its
flare. Finding rhyming words was
not as always as easy as it seemed,
at least not for a poetry illiterate
like myself. Since the limerick
was becoming a pain in the neck,
I crossed that challenge off of my
to-do list.
. Two down, two to go was my
thought upon moving to the third
challenge: "Reimagine the thesis
for a paper you're working on or
have already written AS a haiku."
Great, more poetry. I wanted to
throw in the towel on this challenge
immediately, but convinced myself
to give this poem a try though I
foresaw an uphill battle. To be fair,

id-Facebook procrastination session
recently, I came across a video titled
"[Graphic] Footage Recovered
of ISIS Butchering 1500
Hostages Like Cattle." The
picture preview under the
post was of what looked
like a twenty-something,
likely Arab, crouching and
grimacing straight at the
camera with a man behind
him sprawled on the dirt
with what looked like a blood yARDAIN
splotch onhisbare foot. AMRON
Call me fucked up, but I
clicked. And I'm still trying
to understand why.
The title was no exaggeration: open-bed
trucks with plain-clothed prisoners packed in
like cattle; said prisoners lined on their bellies,
faces inthe dirt; gunmen shooting the prisoners
point blank. You can't see the bullets or even
where they hit exactly, but after each kickback
from the assault rifle, a body bounces or jolts off
the ground like Jell-O.
After the last clip - in which a procession of
prisonerskneelonabloody dock and are executed
by a masked man with a pistol and dumped in the
water - I just sat there in the dark of my room for
a moment, listening to the dehumidifier rattle. I
tried quixotically for a few seconds to place "my
feet" in masked pistol man's "shoes." To grasp
the fact that such evil exists in the world today.
To feel something for the slaughtered.
I failed, I think, on all counts, and simply
conjured an associative image of Holocaust
cattle cars I had seen in a history textbook. I
took a heavy sigh, and returned to my newsfeed
where I chanced upon a compilation video of
babies farting. I clicked and spooned a clump
of Life cereal in excitement. Next thing I know,
I'm spewing milk-soaked bits across the screen

as a baby rips one at an open-casket funeral.
I feel guilty about my laughter. Desensitized
surely. The juxtaposition of such heart
-curdling and -cuddling content is terrible, and
can't be healthy for my psyche. .
It was during the Vietnam War (or the
American War to the Vietnamese) that death
and bloodshed first entered the average
American living room on a wide scale. As the
sprinkler watered the lawn and the pot roast
broiled, our parents and grandparentsgathered
around the tube to watch the destruction their
country was unloading across the globe.
But even then, what the media chose to
televise was filtered and censored. Only today,
with the advent of the Internet, is it possible to
bypass big media altogether and still reach the
populace. And when radical groups like ISIS
upload their terror videos, in their eyes, the
more gruesome the better. The wickedness of
the world in such raw form has not before been
viewable to the clean-handed masses.
Still, I'm sure there's a sizable group out
there that would rather avoid watching death,
and chose not to click on ISIS's video in the first
place. But I'm also sure I'm not the only one
who did click. I've never seen someone die, or
even someone dead for that matter - in real
life I mean - but I can say now that I've seen
humans die on camera.
What scares me is that nothing has changed.
Why I can't post the ISIS link here is because it
would drive webtraffic tothevideo.I completely
get that reason, but I also feel justified for
watching the slaughter to sympathize and
actualize the dead. For understanding more
lucidly, the evil that exists in this world. It's a
tricky line to maneuver, no doubt, butimagining
without seeing isn't always enough.

Coming from a family of
educators, professors and
school administrators,
Stuart Rankin
enrolled at the
University of
Michigan in the
summer of 1945
with every inten-
tion of becom-
ing an engineer.
Throughout his LAUREN
freshman year at MCCARTHY
the University,
Rankin discov-
ered that he had
no issue completing the logistical
portions of the engineering course
load, but found that he was not
entirely interested in the nature of
the work. He transferred into the
College of Literature, Science and
the Arts, and sampled a number of
courses before graduating with a
degree in Economics and no defi-
nite career path.
Shortly after Stuart Rankin
graduated from the University of
Michigan in 1949, however, he was
drafted into the U.S. Army as it
prepared for the Korean War. On
post, Rankin metanumber ofpeople
who had not yet been activated,
and like himself, they spent their
time enlisted living and working
on the army base while stationed
safely in the personnel office. In the
evenings and on weekends, Stuart
and a handful of his friends from
the base - seven or so - developed
a routine of heading into Highland,
Illinois, to grab a few drinks.
After some time, these seven
friends mustered up the courage
to confront Rankin. They knew
he had gone to college, and having
graduated from the University
of Michigan, that made him the
minority in their circle. For these
seven friends of his, attending a
university had never been an option.
They hadn't tried particularly hard
in high school because there was
nothing to come of it. However,
following the enactment of the
Servicemen's Readjustment Act -
informally understood to be the
G.I. Bill - a college education had
suddenly become a reality.

THIS IS HALLOWEEN: the Do's and Don'ts
By Jaclyn Nagel, Weekend Roundup Contributor I Photos by Emilie Plesset, Weekend Roundup Editor

When you look back on
Halloween in a week, a month,
or a year, you want to remember
it as one of the best weekends of
your life. Follow these do's and
don'ts to ensure your weekend is
a dream, not a nightmare.

DRESSUP
Halloween is the one time of
year that you can pretend to be

could be anything from a beanie

Potter to a dust bunny. This is
your opportunity to escape from
reality, which is pretty ideal right
after midterms. Especially after
getting your grades back.
GO ALL OUT
Throughout the year, you
may go to a variety of themed
parties, but wearing a sequin
headband isn't exactly "dressing
up." Halloween is the time to go
all out. From your head to your

toes, nothing should be out of against.

watch during Halloweekend ONLINE!

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Weekend Roundup Editor
It's finally Halloween, giving
students across campus an
excuse to dress up in ridiculous
outfits for one night of the year.
Whether you're at a Halloween-
themed party or trick-or-
treating, you'll eventually have
some down time. I know there's
homework to do and tests to
study for, but take a break from
all of that. Instead, sit back and
choose from one of these must-
watch Halloween movies.
HALLOWEENTOWN
If you had any sort of
childhood, you had to have seen
the great Disney classic from
1998, "Halloweentown." In a
time before DVR cable boxes,
watching "Halloweentown"
annually became a tradition for
many."Halloweentown"follows
Marnie Piper's family as they
try to stop the darkness from
taking over Halloweentown, a
society full of ghouls and ghosts
that is separate from society.
Even now, this movie still packs
all of the enjoyment my younger
self felt every year.
If you love this movie
enough, watch the sequel
"Halloweentown II: Kalabar's
Revenge." It doesn't have that
feeling of originality, but is still
fun like the original. But be
advised: avoid "Halloweentown
High" and "Return to
Halloweentown," both of which
may lead you to throw up the
candy you worked hard to get.
ALIEN
"In space, no one can hear
you scream."
If that doesn't make your
blood curdle, good for you.
But for the rest of us, "Alien"
is a classic sci-fi horror
movie that follows a group of
scientists traveling in outer
space on a research mission.
If you like Sigourney Weaver,
chest-bursting aliens and

'face-huggers' (still give me
nightmares), this is the movie
for you.
ALIENS
If you want less of a
psychological thriller and
more of a sci-fi action movie
with horror elements, watch
"Aliens." This sequel is just as
scary, but focuses more on the
fight against the xenomorph
aliens. The movie's most
memorable line is "They mostly
come out at night. Mostly."
In other words, save this
movie for the daytime if you like
sleeping soundly.
CABIN IN THE WOODIS
When I first watched "Cabin
in the Woods," my first thought
was, Isn't that the actor who
plays Thor? It has to be a good
movie. But I quicklylearnedthat
Chris Hemsworth's painful-to-
watch performance signaled
this was a movie poking fun
at horror movie culture while
also trying to be considered a
legitimate scary movie itself.
The movie is about a group of
teenagers who decide it would
be a great idea to stay alone in
a cabin in the woods. If you've
ever seen a scary movie, you can
probably infer how the rest of
the story goes.
There are moments where
I laughed, moments where I
hugged my knees, and moments
where I cried (from more
hysterical laughter). Overall,
this is a great movie to get akick
out of with your friends. The
ending of the movie escalates
very quickly, and will leave you
absolutely flabbergasted.
BEETLEJUICE
"Beetlejuice" is a classic late
'80s movie starring Michael
Keaton, Alec Baldwin and
Geena Davis. More importantly,
"Beetlejuice" is directed by Tim
Burton. Burton, an expert in
quirky horror films, takes us on
an adventure with Baldwin and

Davis, a married couple who die
in the beginning of the movie.
Upon their death, we follow
them through the world of
the dead until they return to
the home they left behind and
haunt its newest residents.
"Beetlejuice" is one of the
funniest Halloween movies I've
seen. If you've never seen it,
you're definitely missing out.

FOOTBALL
Passing game seeks
remedy in practice

With LeVert Spike, 'M'in good hands

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
The Michigan football team
passed for 503 yards in a,63-47
victory over Indianalast year. The
Wolverines haven't reached that
many yards in their past three
games combined.
Last year, Michigan passed for
more than 200 yards in nine of
its 13 games, including seven of
its first eight. This year, it hasn't
recorded a single game with more
than 200 passing yards.
Most importantly, the
Wolverines passed for 21
touchdowns last year, including
13 through eight games. This year,
they've recorded just six.
It's in large part why they've
been scoring less and explains in
partthestrugglesofapoorseason.
The passing game hasn't played
at a level to win games, and with
just four contests left, the chances
to improve its aerial attack are
looking less likely by the day.
"I don't think it's anyone
individually that's caused that
problem," said sophomore tight
end Jake Butt. "We left a lot out on
the field. I think that'sjust more of
a need to execute."
The Wolverines have failed to
execute in nearly every aspect of
the passing attack, though, from
the catching to the blocking.
Fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner has proven
inconsistent enough to be
benched, or more recently against
Michigan State, pulled for a
play. Last week, he threw two
interceptions..
Other times, he has missed an
open receiver like Butt, instead
opting to air it out to junior wide
receiver Devin Funchess. He
targeted Funchess 17 times in the
past three games and 41 times

on the season - the most of any
receiver.
But his offensive line hasn't
blocked long enough to let him
set his feet and pass. If Gardner
wasn't being hit by the Spartans
ashe threw,he was scrambling for
room after they hurried him four
times and sacked him twice.
And when he did get the ball
out, his wide receivers couldn't
hang onto it. Michigan receivers
droppedsevenpasses on Saturday,
a rarity this season.
"In the passing game, routes
being cut short, routes not being
exactly what we want.," said
Michigan coch Brady Hoke.
"Again, we've got to do a good job
of catching the football. There's
multiple reasons (for struggling in
the passing game)."
Often, the passing game will
be dependent on the running
game for its success, which has
become tougher after the loss of
sophomore running back Derrick
Green to a season-ending injury.
The Wolverines, under offensive
coordinator Doug Nussmeier, ran
just under a dozen pass plays out
of play action Saturday, including
three in the fourth quarter when
they had yet to score a touchdown.
This week, practice has pitted
first-team defensive players
against first-team offensive
players, as opposed to playing
against a scout team, for the sake
of simulating game speed and
intensity. But that might be the
only difference.
"We still do the same stuff.
If not, in similar forms," said
redshirt junior Justice Hayes.
"We're very confident in our
schemes and gameplan."
If they won't change their
offense, than they'll need to
be near perfect in execution to
succeed through the air.

T wo Thursdays ago,
Spike Albrecht and
Canis Levert had job
interviews.
They'd both been preparing
for this day for years, but neither
thought
it would
actually
come. The -
two under-
recruited
high school
players
stood in the SIMON
shadows of KAFMAN
the other
members of
the Fresh Five recruiting class.
But now, with just two of the
original five remaining, it's up
to Spike and LeVert to accept a
promotion.
Instead of a single
interviewer, a handful of
reporters surrounded the
juniorguards and started firing
questions. The interviewee's
goal wasn't a new job as much as
it was to prove he was worthy of
the one he already had.
The job description? Leading
a team that includes six true
freshmen deep into the NCAA
Tournament.
Spike and LeVert answered
one question clearly, Despite
losing five players from last
year's team, the Wolverines are
in good hands.
Compared to last year, the
roles aren't as clearly defined
this season. But one thing is -
the first tier of leaders will be
Spike and LeVert.
Early in his interview,
Spike starts hearing questions
about that night. The one that
transformed the under-recruited
5-foot-11 guard from a nobody to
a guy whom nobody forgets.
The reporter finishes his
question, and Spike turns to
another who says he won't be

Juniors Carls LeVert and Spike Albrecht have a new role in their junior years - leading the Michigan bask

asking about that game or that
tweet. Spike is relieved. He
doesn't mind reminiscing about
that night or that tweet, but he'd
rather talk about this season.
That night is just one line
on his lengthy resume which
also features a team-best 4.6
assist-to-turnover ratio from
last season. That night doesn't
showcase his selflessness.
That night is in the past. He
has been there, done that, and
wants to do it again.
That's why the self-
admittedly shy guy will be one
of Michigan's most vocal leaders
this year. He has to be.
LeVertsits on the other side
of the table taking his own
questions. He's asked about
his body. The one that came
onto campus as a scrawny 170-

pound brace-faced freshman
and is listed now at 200 pounds
after long days spent in the
gym. The one whose owner
has demonstrated a gym-rat
work ethic and already has
people talking about a potential
promotion to the NBA.
In his seat at media day, he
thinks about each question,
hesitatesbriefly and gives quick,
quiet responses. You wouldn't
know that when the suit comes
off and the jersey goes on,
he's capable of crossing over
defenders and attacking the rim
or spotting up behind the arc to
knock down 3-pointers.
College coaches looking to
employ his talents sure didn't
know it. And now, LeVert, who
was named to the Preseason All-
Big Ten team, is ready to live up
to the expectations.

"This year, (my role) is alot
more clear, so I'm definitely
more prepared for my role,"
he said. "(My role) is to be the
leader of the team. One of the
captains, hopefully me and Spike
can really take on that role."
As the interview comesto an
end, the two get up from their
seats. The dayisn't over yet.
LeVert has a photo shoot with
ESPN, and Spike has a radio
interview with SiriusXM.
Spike and LeVert don't need a
letter of acceptance to know that
they aced the interview and have
the job already.
Now it's time to make the
money.

family. I have very little experi-
ence with Greek food. I study
Ancient Greek, so my percep-
tion of Hellenic culture is all
thighbones burned at the altar,
ramming triremes and bearded
philosophers canoodling beauti-
ful boys. My perception of the
food was that it wasn't Italian.
I had no idea whether to expect
vague pan-Mediterranean com-
fort, or a restaurant plucked
straight out of Athens via heli-
copter and plopped down next to
the Ann Arbor Panera.
There were no thighbones
burning in the kitchen when
I first stepped into Mezes, but
there was a spit stacked high
with layers of lamb slowly turn-
ing next to heat lamps. That
lamb is sliced off in short strips
for gyro, a staple Greek dish that
Mezes serves several versions
of. The one I tried on my first
visit was classic: meat, cucum-
ber, lettuce, tomato, onion and
yogurt sauce ... except for the
three fries placed ontop. I think
this dish best represents Mezes'
solution to the conundrum pre-
sented at the beginning. The
food is unmistakably, authenti-
cally Greek, but with American

touches that are simultaneously
comforting and creative.
The menu revolves around
several core proteins, differing
in both type and preparation.
There's the roasted lamb gyro, or
grilled souvlakia of beef, chicken
or pork. You can get all of these
on a skewer or on a pita, either
by itself or with a Greek salad
and grilled bread. I highly rec-
ommend the sandwich route.
The combination of warm meat,
tangy yogurt and crisp vegeta-
bles - with that trio of hot, salty
fries - is simple but full of flavor-
ful contrasts.
The souvlakia is far and away
the best. The menu says that
they're grilled butthey taste like
they've been deep fried, with a
crisp, caramelized exterior and
moist, almost fluffy interior, like
meaty falafel. The gyro also has
a nice flavor, but all those hours
wiltering under the heat lamps
leave the meat a bit desiccated.
The pork and chicken are best
enjoyed on a stick, so that the
flavors of the marinade - olive
oil, lemon, herbs - can come
through.
It'swith the side dishes that
Mezes really creates some
wonderful culinary synergy
between Greece and America.
The first time I went in, the guy
behind the counter asked me if
I wanted Greek fries. I said yes,
and a few minutes later received
what looked like a fresher ver-
sion ofpoutine, thatclassic
Quebecois dish of fries, cheese
curds and brown gravy. This
one was the Greek version, with
lemony dressing, crumbled feta
and olives. What's great about
it is how each element is taken
seriously. The actual fries are
some of the best I've had in Ann
Arbor: thick yet crispy, streaked
with earthy skin. The dressing
isvibrant, the cheese becomes
molten from the heat, the olives
actuallytaste like olives.
The Greek potato salad is even
better. Chunks of tender spud are
combined with not mayonnaise,
but that same lemon dressing
and chopped dill, scallion and

red onion. The potatoes soak up
the vinaigrette, softeningthem
to the point where bits break
off and thicken the olive oil and
lemon. It's potato saladbound
with potato.
If you have any room left, the
baklava is definitely worth it. A
thick layer of chopped walnuts
and honey, fragrant with cumin
and cinnamon, is sandwiched
between layers of phyllo. It's
sweet but not cloying, opulently
rich but not so much thatyou
only eat one bite. And if you're
really inthe mood for some-
thing new, try a Frappe coffee.
I'd never heard of this drink,
which apparently is ubiquitous
in Greece and Cyprus. To make
it, you take Nescafe, water and
sugar blended into a froth and
then pour that into a glass of ice
and milk. It tastes like a glass full
of cappuccino foam, and must be
drunk in small sips.
A mix of
passion,
politeness, sass
and herbs.
Whatever you order, I'm sure
that you'll notice the unique
ambiance of Mezes as soon as you
walk in. This is not a place for
the grumpy or antisocial. Ask
about the ingredients of a salad,
and you might get a long lecture
about the careful sourcing of
the olive oil. Cough when you
walk in, and you'll be told that
you need soup. Sit down, and
you'll definitely get at least two
people asking you if you like
everything, with a recommenda-
tion for what to order next time.
At Mezes, this mix of passion,
politeness and sass is as impor-
tant as the mixture of herbs.

he was Greek. To console him,

'Hungry Like
the Wolf'
I'm assuming 99.9 percent of
people don't think of Halloween
when they hear Duran Duran's
"Hungry Like the Wolf," but it's
basically on every Spotify Hal-
loween playlist and I haven't
stopped listening to it for the past
four weeks for whatever reason,
so I'm running with it. I'll be hon-
est - for the longest time, when-
ever I heard this song I thought
of "Lizzie McGuire," because I'm
kind of sure that there was an epi-
sode where Lizzie, Miranda and
Gordo were running around the
halls ofbtheir junior high whilethis
song played. Or maybe I'm think-
ing of "Big FatLiar" - I know for a
fact this song was in that movie.It's

original but distinctly relatable,
funny for a giggly seven year old,
and funnier for a 19 year old who

OK, "American Horror Story"

"Horror Story" 's two-part Hal-

an undisputed highlight of the
critically acclaimed anthology

freaks inevitably perform on Hal-

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Unsurprisingly devoid of
excitement or hype, OK Go
released a new album this past
week titled
Hungry
Ghosts. It's
a decent I Won't Let
album with
a classic alt- You Go
pop sound OK Go
similarto BMG Rights
other con-
temporaries
like American Authors or Shep-
pard. Despite the mediocrity of
the album, Internet energy float-
ed around its release because of
what it promised: a new OK Go
music video. The band holds all
its true talent and ingenuity in
its music video making efforts.
With millions of views on You-
Tube to prove it, OK Go dedi-
cates itself and itssmild musical
success to the production of
eccentric, extensive and awe-
provoking visual feats - in the
form of a music video. "I Won't
Let You Down" passively plays
as the upbeat background to
another visual masterpiece.
Directed by noted Japanese
director Morihiro Harano, the
music video begins in an aban-
doned warehouse in the city of
Chiba, about 45 minutes out-
side of Tokyo. The high-tech

BMG RIGHTS

nature of this video stands out
immediately. The camera is a
specialized drone controlled
both by GPS and hand. The
band members also never leave
their chairs, which are motor-
ized scooter-like transporters
from which they move around
and choreograph feigned tap
dancing and umbrella twirls.
Initially the band is very Gene
Kelly a la "Singin' in the Rain."
Black suits, colorful socks and
tap dancing from futuristic
moving chairs. And then the
troupe of Japanese dancers
appear...
Next, the camera drone fol-
lows the band and girls outside

into a manicurel_ parking lot.
Here the umbrella swirls and
the dancing becomes more
theatrical and complex. The
drone camera takes an aerial
view and follows the impecca-
bly synchronized movements
of the dancers and band mates.
The ending aerial display is
the zenith of the video, made
even more incredible by the
knowledge that it was shot 50
to 60 times to achieve perfec-
tion.
It's another great music
video from the OK Go boys.
The 2010 Rube Goldberg
Machine video for "This Too
Shall Pass" is hard to beat, but

the meticulous production of
this video keeps it in a close
second. Enhanced only slightly
by the music, the "I Won't Let
You Down" music video has
already surpassed 6 million
views. For those previously
uneducated in OK Go's visual
talents, this music video is
an excellent example of the
dedication and large-scale
approaches they are willingto
take for a mediocre, five-minute
song.You don't have to think too
much or listen too hard: Just sit
back and watch as a drone guides
your eyes on a synchronized rou-
tine in Japan.

"(Luther is) one of the few
places where you can get kids
to come out and actually give a
shit," he added. "Every band you
meet in Ann Arbor says 'Hey, I

it feels like a rite of passage."
Beyond the co-op,
to Ann Arbor
Luther Co-op's withstanding
focus on live music over the years
is indisputable. Known as the
location of poet and activist John
Sinclair's freedom rally - whose
efforts led to the redefining of
marijuana laws in Ann Arbor
40 years ago to allow the annual
Hash Bash - the Luther House
has since been a conglomeration
of artists, musicians and writers,
and is often recognized for their
annual Halloween parties.
Acting as a leaping point for
local bands to play at larger ven-
ues like The Blind Pig, Luther has
served as an anchor to musicians
across all genres. Calling himself
the "bearer of the torch for this
generation" of Luther music,
Rosette said the co-op was happy
to be a part of the growing dia-
logue about local music.
"Luther iswelcoming, it's open
and it's a place where people
know that they will have a good
time and they will be exposed to
real music made by real people
who are just doing it for the love
of making music," Rosette said.
"That's one big love pot."
By coexisting in the same
music environment as newer
bands such as San Cristobal,
Caves and Yada Yada, Azzam
said it felt as if they were "rejuve-
nating the music scene" together
and gaining recognition as local
artists.
"It feels like one of the things
about being a musician in Ann
Arbor that I've heard a lot of
people talking about is that a
few years ago - through artists
like Theo Katzman and My Dear
Disco - it was a unified scene
and everything was really com-
ingtogether. I never really expe-
rienced that, but it's all sort of
coming back."

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Literary Columnist
A s Halloween
approaches, I've been
wracking my brain
to find a suitably spookyctopic
to write on this week. As I've
already written about my favorite
horror stories, I was left to won-
der what else could strike fear
into your very hearts, gentle
readers.
The release of midterm
grades? Perhaps. Scheduling
classes for next semester?
Undoubtedly. The remainder
of this football season? Noth-
ing quite so terrifying.
Well how about that this
Saturday marks the begin-
ning of National Novel Writ-
ing Month, better known as
NaNoWriMo? Cue the flicker-
ing lights and jarring minor
chords.
For those of you who don't
know, NaNoWriMo is an
annual online creative writ-
ing project that challenges
participants to write 50,000
words of an original novel
from Nov. 1 to Nov. 30. Using
the NaNoWriMo site, you can
track your progress, connect
with fellow writers and access
resources for when you're feel-
ing stuck.
Many may scoff at the idea of
writing a quality novel within
a month, but before you start
throwing your vintage type-
writers at me, hear me out.
The point of NaNoWriMo isn't
for writers to churn out per-
fectly crafted novels. Instead,
it provides budding novelists
with a semi-structured plan to
produce a first draft, which can.
then be edited after the month
is over.
Given all this, you may won-
der why I think of NaNoWriMo
as a potentially scary subject.
If your experiences with it are
anything like my own, it's not
hard to guess. I tend to follow a
very set pattern in which I first
feel totally up for NaNoWriMo,
I then proceed to forget about
it until a week into November,
after which I furiously scribble
out a page to somewhat catch
up, then never return to it but
swear I'll do better next year.
However, no excuses this
year, because I am now publicly
accountable to you, dear read-
ers. To better prepare myself
and any others who may be

participating, I've compiled
a few tips on writing from
famous authors that I person-
ally think are quite useful.
"Murder your darlings."
- Arthur Quiller-Couch
Variations of this quote have
been attributed to numerous
writers across time, includ-
ing Allen Ginsberg, William
Faulkner, Stephen King and
of course, who else, but Oscar
Wilde. So why have so many
writers espoused this senti-
ment? Put simply, it's damn
good advice. First and fore-
most, it refers to the need to
eliminate characters, dialogue
and passages that you as the
author may love but that don't
advance the story for the read-
er. I also like to think of it as
differentiating between writ-
ing and wish fulfillment. No
one wants to read about happy
things happening to perfect
people because there's no
story there. Conflict is essen-
tial for not only an interesting,
plot but also for meaningful
character development. You
don't have to kill off your
favorite character or leave
them miserable, but stay vigi-
lant against Mary Sues and
Marty Stus.
"No tears in the writer,
no tears in the reader. No
surprise in the writer, no
surprise in the reader."
- Robert Frost
Respect your audience. If
a passage isn't emotionally
poignant or thrilling for you
as the writer, don't assume it
will be different for the read-
er. If you think something is
important but you don't know
how to frame it interestingly,
keep experimenting. Read-
ers will know if you're just
phoning in a scene. And don't
underestimate your audi-
ence either. Literary devices,
especially symbols and fore-
shadowing, don't need to be
shoved in the reader's face.
Keep it suibtle, but purposeful.
"Don't tell me the moon is
shining; show me the glint
of light on broken glass."
- Anton Chekhov
Let's be real. This sentence
is more poetic and expressive

than anything I have or will
ever write. But I'm not even
discouraged, because it's fan-
tastic advice. Writers often
talk about the concept of
showing, not telling, meaning
that rote exposition and sum-
marization can only take you so
far. Immersing a reader com-
pletely in your story requires
giving them relevant, but also
descriptive information for
them to paint their own version
of your world. This is where
sensory details and subtle
character actions allow you to
gently guide a reader through
your story rather than drag
them through it.
"The worst enemy to
creativity is self-doubt."
- Sylvia Plath
A little self-doubt is not only
normal, but also a veritable
good thing. No one wants you
walking around like the Kanye
of literature. However, when
self-doubt is so strong that it
keeps you from creating out
of fear of failing, it's time to
reevaluate. NaNoWriMo's
time constraint actually works
beneficially here, as a writer
doesn't have time to fuss over
the perfection of every word.
Remember, you can only edit
if you have something written
down.
"Read, read, read. Read
everything - trash, classics,
good and bad, and see
how they do it."
- William Faulkner
I've never heard of a writer
who was-not also a vora-
cious reader. The surest way
to improve your writing,
besides regular writing, is
reading. It's in the works of
others where we establish
who we are as writers, when
we decide what works for us,
what moves us and equally
important, what doesn't. Even
if you're not interested in
writing a novel this Novem-
ber, at least read one. It may
be just as valuable.
So put on a pot of coffee,
disable your WiFi and get
cracking on that next great
American novel.

MICHIGAN HORROR
From Page 1B
At the request of the sources, all
names have been changed.
It's aperfect afternoon,theideal
convergence of early fall sunshine
and sweater weather. There's
somethingunexplainableinthe air
- a definite, palpable excitement.
Halloween night (or, for most col-
lege students, the whole stretch of
weeks between when the leaves
start falling to the early days of
Novemberfmarks the one time of
year when we embrace dark capes,
masks and lurid makeup. Dressing
up as someone else, costuming our
true identities in a Nicki Minaj wig
or cat ears, is a universally appeal-
ing idea, the closest that actual
American society gets to the plot of
the"Purge"movies - theonetime
of year when we can be anything,
and anythingcanhappen.
But underneath that party store
mask, there's a darker side to Hal-
loween. Besides being the one
night a year for consequence-free
party fun, Halloween is a night to
remember the dead. It's a night for
avoiding ouija boards, jumping at
mysterious taps on your ceiling
and a whisper coming from the
graveyard across the street. It's a
night to put aside skepticism and
honor tradition - to heed that
unexplainable feeling in the air
that might be something power-
ful and terrifying, feeding off the
chilly autumn wind and crack-
ling leaves like the blood of an
unsuspecting victim.
Halloween is a night for
ghost stories. But the follow-
ing accounts are not just stories.
These are the actual experi-
ences of University of Michigan
students who have had unex-
plainable encounters with the
supernatural. They have request-
ed to remain anonymous, but
though their names have been
changed, the mysteries they
recounted are 100 percent true.
Knocking, knocking at my
hotelroom door
LSA freshman Lily McConnell
is an only child. One night, on
vacation in South Carolina, Mr.
and Mrs. McConnell left their
(then) 12-yearnold daughter by
herself in the hotel room, lea-
ing little Lily with a bunch of cool
movies to entertain her in their
absence.
"I was watching a movie when
I heard knocking on the door. I
was like, 'What the heck?,' so I
got up and looked through the
peephole," McConnell said.
She tiptoed to the door.
Through the peephole, Lily saw
nothing but the empty hallway,
an expanse of identical closed
doors on either side of hers. Lily
shut the door, but upon doing
so, the knocking immediately
resumed. The door rattled from
the sheer force of the person
knocking at it, and McConnell
began to become afraid. She hid
behind the bed, hoping the noise
would stop before she had to call
her parents at the hotel restau-
rant downstairs.
Her prayers were answered
when the rattling finally stopped.
"Andthen, like any other scary
movie, what does the girl do? She

goes and opens the door," McCo-
nnell recounted.
Lily went to the door right
after the tapping stopped, but
again there was no one in the
long and empty hallway. No reg-
ular human could possibly have
run from the McConnells' door
to the end of the hallway in so
short a time. She resigned to go
back to watching her movie.
"A little while later, the knock-
ing started again. But this time,
it was more violent and more
intense, and I was like, 'Oh my
God, this is scary. And I called my
parents, crying and screaming,"'
McConnell said.
Mr. and Mrs. McConnell left
their dinner in panic as their
young daughter sobbed on the
phone upstairs. They hurried to
find a shortcut to the second floor
of the hotel, where Lily was stuck
in the room terrified as some
stranger beat down her door. The
McConnells ran through the res-
taurant's kitchen, and the chef
pointed them in the direction of a
staircase that would lead to their
daughter.
As they raced to her rescue,
Lily's parents stayed on the line
and tried to coax their daughter
from her hysteria.
"The whole time I'm talk-
ing with them on the phone, the
knocking is happening and they
can hear it through the phone,"
McConnell remembered.

Eventually, Lily's parents
made it down the hall and stood
at the door where Lily waited,
paralyzed with fear but stillhold-
ing the phone with mom and dad
on the line.
When they approached the
door, the phone fell silent. The
knocking had stopped. When her
parents came back to the room,
the McConnells didn't hear any-
thing again from the mysterious
stranger who'd rapped so intent-
ly at the door earlier that night.
Today, Lily looks back on that
night as an unequivocally super-
natural encounter. She affirms
that she believed in ghosts before
her stay at the hotel, and keeps
her faith that beings other than
humans exist. As for character-
izing the creature that visited
her that night, Lily's experience
emulates that of the paradigmat-
ic scary story.
"It exemplified my belief in
(the supernatural), so that kind
of changed my perspective. I
was like, 'I definitely believe in it'
instead of, 'Eh, there might be."'
Humans have a natural aver-
sion to being alone. Something
about the absence of another
person's warmth creates an ideal
environment for the demons
haunting us to come alive, for
voices to leap from our minds and
translate into strange noises that
we try and convince ourselves
we didn't hear. Many times, the
fear is a trick of the mind. But on
other occasions, the spirits of the
darkness prey when we are most
vulnerable.
Spirited away
LSA sophomore Grace Holden
has always believed in ghosts.
Well, not exactly ghosts, per se
- Holden grew up in a religious
family, where she was raised
with the belief that intangible,
often benevolent spirits share the
earth with us humans. Usually,
mediums (people with the spe-
cial gift of being able to decipher
the presence of the spirits) and
young children are more percep-
tive than the general population,
and are more likely to encounter
the supernatural. But sometimes,
when the connection of the dead
is strong enough, they take the
initiative to make themselves
JtnTown. .
"It's common for spirits to use
technology or leave little signals
or signsajust to send positive mes-
sages and tell you that they're
OK," Holden said.
When Grace was 16 years old,
her grandmother passed away.
Nan, as Grace calls her, was also a
strong believer in the supernatu-
ral. After her death, Grace looked
for a sign from her nan, maybe a
glass of water moved to the other
table or a lucky penny on the
ground. Sure enough, the lights
started flickering, and Grace
knew it was a message from her
nan.
"I went to the washroom, buttI
asked one ofthe guys who worked
at the funeral home if they'd been
having electricity problems, and
he said that it was just that day
- that morning - that the lights
started flickering. They said that
the lights actually started flicker-
ing pretty much the same time

that they brought my nan in to
prepare for the funeral," Holden
said.
Echoing in Grace's head was
her mother's advice not to be
afraid to talk to spirits. So she
went into the bathroom, asking
for another clear sign.
"Nan, if this is you, flick the
lights twice right now, just so I
know it's you."
The lights flashed on and off
twice, quickly but noticeably.
She also felt a pressure on her
forehead, a reassuring kiss come
straight from thin air as Grace
stood at the bathroom sink. Grace
experienced a rush of conflicting
emotion.
"I fell down, started crying
and all that stuff, but it was a kind
of reassurance, a good thing,"
Holden said.
Since Holden is so open with
her beliefs, her friends often con-
fess times they've encountered
signs or images of the supernatu-
ral. She says that most of the sto-
ries she's heard have been similar
to her own - benign spirits who
don't mean to haunt their loved
ones, but just let them know that
they're still watching.
"I believe that there are good
spirits and bad spirits, but I
believe that the majority of them
are good spirits," Holden said.
Holden's experiences shed
light on a powerful misconcep-
tion about ghosts. Not all spirits
are so mean-spirited as popular

lore would suggest, but could
also simply be trapped between
this world and another and wait-
ing for the closure necessary for
them to pass. Any room could
be populated by a number of
them - evidently, their scope of
movement isn't just limited to the
house they died in. The possibil-
ity that deceased grandparents,
neighbors and friends could be
watching at any moment isn't ter-
rifying as much as it is powerful
and haunting. There could very
well be shadows lurking invis-
ibly behind us without our ever
knowing.
The witching hour
LSA senior Dan Wyatt has
always been a huge fan of horror
movies. He's always been drawn
to the dark and unexplainable,
getting his fix through watch-
ing it onscreen instead of risk-
ing peril with a ouija board or
a nighttime cemetery trip. Like
many young teens, Wyatt's favor-
ite sleepover activity was to pop
in a scary DVD and let his imagi-
nation take over.
Late one night, 12-year-old
Dan and his best friend Omar
watched "The Exorcism of Emily
Rose." The movie was scary, but
nothing Dan hadn't seen before.
It was a typical movie night -
until the television screen went
black.
"Our power was on - the
lights were working, everything
was still working - but the TV
just went out. Just, randomly,"
Wyatt said.
Dan and Omar grabbed the
remote, assuming maybe one of
them had sat on it or pressed a
button in the dark. The TV stayed
mysteriously dark.
Dan tried taking pictures with
his phone, thinking maybe the
photos would expose something
he couldn't see with his eyes
alone. There were no mysterious
shadows, no orbs or ghostly glow.
A few minutes later, the screen
flashed back to life, and Dan
and Omar finished watching the
movie without a hitch.
The two boys went to bed
around 3 a.m. According to
"Emily Rose," this is the "witch-
ing hour," a time that mocks the
Christian concept of the Holy
Trinity and when malevolent
spirits can wreak havoc. At the
exact moment Dan's digital clock
struck three, they heard a loud
banging noise from apstairs.
"We both heard it, too. It's not
like one of us was going crazy or
anything."
The boys went completely
quiet, listening for any other out-
standing noise. There was only
silence - until 3:15.
Bam bam bam bam bam bam
bam. Dan and Omar heard heavy
feet running upstairs. Dan tried
to think of an explanation this
time, but the logic just didn't line
up.
"My mom slept upstairs, but it
was running, and loud, and she
definitely wasn't awake then,"
Wyatt said.
At 3:30, the sound inched clos-
er to the boys in the basement.
They heard a loud bang from
somewhere downstairs. Dan
tried to explain it, whispering to
his friend about what the sound

could be, but the symmetry of the
noises with the clock were too
conspicuous to be a coincidence.
Fifteen minutes later, the toi-
let in the basement bathroom
flushed. Dan and Omar wonder
if it could be Dan's sister, who
also had a room downstairs. But
Dan's sister claimed that she slept
through the entire night; she
missed all the noise and certainly
didn't flush the toilet at 3:45 a.m.
"Nothing happened at 4:00,
but it's just maybe ironic that all
this happened at 3:00, 3:15, 3:30,
3:45," Wyatt laughs.
Stories like these can't be eas-
ily attributed to an overactive
imagination, the sounds they
heard sheer coincidence veiled
in post-'Emily Rose" terror.
Those who actively engage with
the paranormal, whether it be
through the tradition of religious
belief or of enjoying horror mov-
ies, are more attuned to the spiri-
tual world around them. People
who know what signs to look
for - who listen in the night for
strange sounds and have a rever-
ence for the echoing unknown
- are more often the ones who
actually hear something.
Yes, Halloween is a time for
dressing up and eating cheap
candy. But it's an unequivocal
opportunity to become attuned
to the vibrant world of spirits,
and maybe even connect with the
world beyond our own.

ARTIST IN

LSA sophomore Maher Hachem raps under the stage name Munch.

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
SeniorArts Editor
All genres of music carry
with them a certain persona
expected of its musicians.
There's the somber, tormented
jazz artist, the hedonistic rock
star and the effortlessly cool
rapper. The persona feeds the
music, and the music feeds the
persona - but both avenues can
be dangerous. Too much of the
first and your music becomes
generic and forced. Too much
of the second, and you might
spend more time tuning an image
than an instrument. So for LSA
sophomore Maher Hachem,
who raps under the stage name
Munch, it's all about keeping
things focused on the music.
Hachem, like so many aspiring
artists, is in that anxious limbo
period between making music
as a hobby and making music
to make a living. However, he
claims to not stress out about it.
"In the music industry, when
you make it, you're headlining
shows, you're all over the blogs,
everyone knows who you are,"
Hachem said. "But my main goal
is not exactly to make it, but just
to get my music out there."
"I'm not making music to make
money so that I can buy a huge
house and a nice car," he added.
To put it simply, Hachem is a
rapper, with an EP under his belt
appropriately titled The New Kid.
But Hachem is still hungry to
experiment.
"I consider myself a musician.
I would love to get outside the
realm of hip-hop into producing,
engineering, mixing and
mastering, but as of right now yes
I do consider myself a rapper," he

said.
Hachem's love of hip-hop
started at a young age and came
from an unlikely source.
"My mom was actually the
one who got me into hip-hop. She
would put on 'All Eyes on Me' by
Tupac while driving and know
every single word," he said.
It wasn't until later that he
went beyond just listening to
music.
"Istarted makingmusic maybe
freshman year of high school. It
was just dumb stuff, recorded in
my closet using GarageBand," he
said.
A big break came the next year
when his cousin, having heard
and liked his music, took him to
a recording studio in Windsor.
Hachem, even now, drives back
to the same studio every single
week to record new material.
"Since I've been going there for
five years, me and my engineer
are like best friends now. I'll stay
at his house and record there," he
said.
As he records more and listens
to more hip-hop (he favors Kanye
West, Kendrick Lamar and
Flying Lotus), Hachem is now
experienced enough to improvise
with producers when he goes to
the studio.
"I used to write before I went,
and then show it to him. Now, we
chill, we catch a vibe, we get a
beat and we write to the beat on
the spot," Hachem said.
These sessions might be chill,
but Hachem still has to hustle to
get contacts.
"The whole thing with
the music industry, it's about
networking, man," he said.
"It's so hard to build a solid
relationship solely through

social media."
What Hachem is referring
to is the uneasy balance he and
many young musicians must find
betweentheeasyyetimpersonal
nature of social media, and old
fashioned meetings over coffee.
"I would one hundred percent
rather speak with a person face
to face and show him my music
rather than just send him a link
... you get to understand the
artist more if you sit down with
them," he said.
But because this isn't always
possible, Hachem releases all
of his music on SoundCloud,
which allows him to both track
its popularity and find other
rappers and producers.-
Either way, it seems to be
working: Hachem's music
strikes a nice balance between
being polished and personal.
For example, he recorded a song
on his first album titled "Friday
Night," which is both fun and
irreverent in and of itself, but
particularly relatable to as a
college student.
"I recorded 'Friday Night'
on a Friday night," he said. "I
pictured whatI would be doing if
I wasn't recording. The average
person would enjoy going out on
a Friday night."
of course, as a college student
from West Bloomfield, Hachem
might not seem to have the
"tred" that a successful rapper
would seem to need. Will that
matter in the future? Maybe. But
for now, Hachem makes music
because he loves to do it.
"Whenever r feel like I've
taken a long enough hiatus from
music, I want to make music,
so I'm like 'I need to go.' It's
addicting - real addicting."

EPISODE REVIEW

After a grueling five week
competition, four of the
nation's most talented fashion
designers
showcase
their collec- Project
tions at New
York Fash-
ion Week. Season Finale
The heat of Lifetime
the stress is
definitely palpable, as Kini,
Amanda, Charkita and Sean
race for the winning title.
However, Tim Gunn feels
the need to recap too much
for us, detailing Kini's harsh
critique to rehashing the
drama with Charkita. Regard-
less, the designers remind us
how their toil, sacrifice and
dedication are easily relatable
to viewers.
Come runway time, Aman-
da showcases her "boho chic"
style, while Char shows a
collection of more street than
luxury runway. Kini displays
his impeccable pleats and
sophisticated denim - aweing
us with his ability to recre-
ate his work in only two days,
but overwhelming us with
an excess of ideas. Finally,

Sean's fringe collection dem-
onstrates the cohesiveness the
judges asked for, in what Nina
Garcia calls the "most edito-
rial" of collections.
After the success of the
runway, the judges' cri-
tiques proceed to take up the
remaining airtime, in simply
a reiteration of comments.
After three separate rounds of
deliberation, viewers are left
more bored than excited for
the reveal. Is this their way of
creating anticipation, or sim-
ply building impatience?
The ultimate decision is
a toss-up between Amanda
and Sean, but Sean and his

LIFETIME
fringe train emerge as the
strongest NYFW collection
combined with continuous
success throughout the sea-
son. Surprisingly though, the
celebration of the winner is
meant to be a joyous occasion
that also commends the other
final designers, this finale ends
more dismally. The other con-
testants all burst into a fit of
(happy?) tears in a damper to
what is supposed to be a happy
day.
Regardless, Season 13 waves
"Auf Wiedersehen!" and hope-
fully a "see you soon"to next
season.
